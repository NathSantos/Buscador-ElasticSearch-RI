Aveiro. \n\nO estudo de campo permitiu caracterizar perfis longitudinais, \nverticais e tidais de abund\u00e2ncia e de produtividade bacteriana, pondo em \nevid\u00eancia alguns dos factores que controlam esses padr\u00f5es de varia\u00e7\u00e3o. Os \nensaios laboratoriais foram realizados para caracterizar o potencial \nbacteriano de reactiva\u00e7\u00e3o, o efeito das correntes tidais sobre a actividade do \nbacteriop\u00e2ncton e a contribui\u00e7\u00e3o da infec\u00e7\u00e3o viral e da preda\u00e7\u00e3o para a \nmortalidade bacteriana. \n\nNo estu\u00e1rio foram encontrados perfis longitudinais de abund\u00e2ncia \n(bact\u00e9rias totais 2,6-15,3 x 109 l-1 e bact\u00e9rias activas 0,1-3,7 x 109 l-1) e de \nprodutividade (0,05-18,6 \u00b5g C l-1 h-1) distintos, com m\u00e1ximos no estu\u00e1rio \nm\u00e9dio e m\u00ednimos no estu\u00e1rio inferior. \n\nNa sec\u00e7\u00e3o mais baixa do estu\u00e1rio a abund\u00e2ncia e produtividade \nforam semelhantes ao longo da coluna de \u00e1gua mas, na zona marinha, a \nprodutividade bacteriana foi significativamente mais elevada \u00e0 superf\u00edcie \n(at\u00e9 0,5 m) que nas camadas mais profundas da coluna de \u00e1gua. \n\nFoi observado um padr\u00e3o tidal de varia\u00e7\u00e3o bastante n\u00edtido, \nnomeadamente na zona marinha, caracterizado por aumentos de densidade \ne produtividade perto da baixa mar e decr\u00e9scimos na preia mar. \n\nA varia\u00e7\u00e3o sazonal do bacteriop\u00e2ncton foi caracter\u00edstica de um \nsistema temperado, com picos durante a esta\u00e7\u00e3o quente e valores mais \nbaixos nos meses frios. \n\nNeste estu\u00e1rio, a maior parte das bact\u00e9rias (cerca de 70 %) s\u00e3o \naparentemente inactivas e podem n\u00e3o responder, em per\u00edodos curtos de 3 \nhoras, \u00e0 estimula\u00e7\u00e3o com nutrientes. \n\nDe entre os factores ambientais estudados, a temperatura e a \nsalinidade foram as vari\u00e1veis que melhor explicaram a varia\u00e7\u00e3o bacteriana. \nA disponibilidade em substratos tamb\u00e9m foi um factor importante no controle \nda actividade bacteriana, nomeadamente na zona marinha do estu\u00e1rio. \nEmbora durante a esta\u00e7\u00e3o quente uma m\u00e9dia de 21 % da produ\u00e7\u00e3o prim\u00e1ria \nseja potencialmente suficiente para suportar a produ\u00e7\u00e3o bacteriana no \nestu\u00e1rio, a mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica aloctone pode suportar uma parte significativa \ndo crescimento bacteriano, nomeadamente nos meses frios e na zona \nsalobra. A contribui\u00e7\u00e3o da ressuspens\u00e3o de sedimentos e da entrada de \nmateriais particulados a partir da \u00e1rea de sapal pode ser considerada \nirrelevante para a actividade bacteriana. \n\nA infec\u00e7\u00e3o viral e a preda\u00e7\u00e3o exercem um controle forte sobre o \nbacteriop\u00e2ncton da Ria. A contribui\u00e7\u00e3o da preda\u00e7\u00e3o para a mortalidade \nbacteriana foi similar ao longo do estu\u00e1rio (69 % na zona marinha e 73 % na \nzona salobra) mas o controle por infec\u00e7\u00e3o viral (nas condi\u00e7\u00f5es da \nexperi\u00eancia) na zona salobra atingiu quase o dobro (59 % na zona salobra e \n36 % na zona marinha). \n\nA capacidade de resposta r\u00e1pida \u00e0 varia\u00e7\u00e3o das caracter\u00edsticas da \n\u00e1gua p\u00f5e em evid\u00eancia a exist\u00eancia de reactividade bacteriana durante o \nciclo tidal.

Laboratory \nassays were performed to characterise the bacterial potential to loose or \nresume viability, the effect of tidal currents on bacterial activity and the \ncontribution of viral infection and predation to bacterial mortality. \n\nA distinct longitudinal profile of bacterial abundance (total bacteria 2.6-\n15.3 x 109 l-1 and active bacteria 0.1-3.7 x 109 l-1) and productivity (0.05-18.6 \n\u00b5g C l-1 h-1), with peaks at the mid-section, was observed in the estuary. \n\nIn the shallower section of the estuary, bacterial abundance and \nproductivity were similar down the water column but in the marine zone \nbacterial productivity was significantly higher (3.3 times, on average) at the \nsurface (down to 0.5 m) than in the deeper layers of the water column. \n\nA clear pattern of tidal variation in density and productivity could be \nobserved, namely in the marine zone. It was characterised by increasing \ndensity near low tide relatively to high tide. \n\nThe seasonal variation of baterioplankton was characteristic of a \ntemperate system with peaks during the warm season and the lowest values \nduring the cold months. \n\nIn this estuary, most of the bacteria (about 70 %) are apparently \ninactive and could not respond to nutrient amendments within the period of \ntime of 3 hours. \n\nAmong the studied environmental factors, temperature and salinity \nwere the variables that better explained bacterial variation. Substrate \navailability was also an important factor controlling bacterial activity, namely \nin the marine zone. Although during the warm season, an average of 21 % of \nthe primary production was potentially sufficient to support the whole \nbacterial production in the estuary, allochthonous organic matter showed to \nsupport significant bacterial growth, namely in the cold months and in the \nbrackish water zone. The contribution of sediment resuspension and of the \ninput of particulate matter from the salt marshe area was irrelevant to \nbacterial activity. \n\nWithin the estuarine system, viral infection and predation exert strong \ncontrol on the bacterioplankton compartment. The contribution of predation \nto bacterial mortality was similar throughout the system (69 % in the marine \nzone and 73 % in the brackish water zone) but the control by maximal viral \ninfection (in the conditions of the experiment) almost doubled in the brackish \nwater zone (59 % in brackish water and 36 % in marine water). \n\nThe capacity for short-term responses to changing water properties is \nevidence for reactivity during tidal cycles. The different profiles of marine and \nbrackish water bacteria to these conditions suggest that bacterial \nassemblages are diverse within the estuary. \n\nIn face of the present results, it is concluded that the bacterioplankton \nof Ria de Aveiro evolves under physical, chemical, nutritional and biological \npressures that are in different balance in the marine and brackish water \nzones. \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n \n\nCONTENTS \n \nChapter 1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter 2 \n \nChapter 3 \n \n \nChapter 4 \n \n \nChapter 5 \n \n \nChapter 6 \n \n \nChapter 7 \n \n\nIntroduction \n1.

Marine and estuarine bacterioplankton \n \n1.1. Ecological role of bacterioplankton \nBacteria are the most abundant and the most important biological component involved in \n\nthe turnover (transformation and remineralisation) of organic matter in aquatic systems (Cho and \nAzam, 1990; Pomeroy et al., 1991). In coastal waters, heterotrophic bacteria often amounts to 10-\n30% of the living carbon biomass (Holligan et al., 1984, Cho and Azam, 1990) and may utilize as \nmuch as 40% of the carbon fixed by the primary producers (reviewed by Cole et al., 1988; Cho and \nAzam, 1990; Ducklow and Carlson, 1992). \n\nHeterotrophic bacteria are particularly skilled for organic matter transformation. They \nhydrolise dissolved and particulate organic matter, they can utilise substrates of difficult \ndegradation and even use different allocthchtonous compounds as further sources of organic \ncarbon. They convert dissolved organic carbon that would inevitably be lost to other members of \nthe food web, into particulate carbon that becomes then potentially available to higher trophic \nlevels (microbial loop). This capacity to the recover of dissolved organic carbon is significant in \nthat it represents a link between the sources at different levels and higher consumers (Azam and \nHodson, 1977; Azam, 1998; Pomeroy and Weibe, 1998). Moreover, studies in several aquatic \nenvironments have indicated that the microbial loop (phytoplankton ? DOC ? bacteria ? \nprotozoa ?metazoa) can processes roughly as much energy as the classical grazing food chain \n(phytoplankton ? herbivore animals ? carnivores animals) as reported by Riemann and \nSondergaard (1986). Therefore the microbial loop has become increasingly recognized as an \nimportant component of the aquatic food web and it has been suggested that it must be explicitly \nrepresented in ecosystem models (Anderson, personal communication). \n\nThrough remineralisation of organic matter, bacteria regenerate nutrients in situ which are \nthen used by the primary producers. Heterotrophic bacteria respire organic carbon to inorganic \ncarbon at high rates, making bacterial respiration the major fraction of the total measured \nrespiration in most aquatic systems (Williams, 1981). Cole et al. (1988) estimated, across a wide \nrange of trophic conditions, that bacterial respiration is, at least, as larger as zooplankton \nrespiration, reaching values up to 40% of the total planktonic respiration (Cole and Pace, 1995). \n\nIt has been shown that bacteria not only transform and respire organic matter, but they also \ncontribute for the export of relatively recalcitrant compounds to the bottom layers of water basins \n(Smith et al., 1992; Rivkin et al., 1996). Export is supported by the occurrence of enzymatic \nhydrolysis without efficient uptake of the resulting hydrolysate (Smith et al., 1992). Recently, \n\n\n\n \nIntroduction \n\n \n\n2 \n\nStoderegger and Herndl (1998) showed that bacteria release up to 9% of the total carbon uptake in \nthe form of difficult-to-degrade capsular material. The incorporation and respiration rates of this \ncarbon material by bacterioplankton is three orders of magnitude lower than for glucose, suggesting \nthat some forms of bacterial derived organic carbon may contribute substantially to the semilabile \norganic carbon pool in aquatic systems (Stoderegger and Herndl, 1998). Moreover, it has been \nshown that the small organisms that characterise the microbial loop (mainly bacteria), although \ngenerally grazed by organisms in the traditional food chain, may also aggregate and sink (Cho and \nAzam, 1988). So, the traditional view that carbon export is solely operated via large organisms \nrequires revision (Anderson, personal communication). \n\nUnderstanding the transformation and remineralization dual character of planktonic \nbacteria in aquatic systems is a central paradigm of contemporary microbial ecology (del Giorgio \nand Cole, 1998). \n\n \n1.2. Contrasting properties of marine and estuarine bacterioplankton \nDifferences and similarities between ecosystems, communities, species and processes have \n\nalways attracted the scientific community. Such comparative analyses produce valuable \ninformation about basic structures and possible functions of the ecosystems (Rieman and \nChristoffersen, 1993). \n\nIt is clear that physical, chemical and biological factors influence the microbial \ncommunities and operate with different strength in oceanic and estuarine environments. \nNevertheless, the fundamental principles of the trophodynamic structure and functions are the same \nin oceanic and estuarine environments (Rieman and Christoffersen, 1993). Differences between \necosystems comprise the relative importance of various microorganisms or microbial processes \n(Rieman and Christoffersen, 1993). Autochthonous material, nutrient starvation (oligothrophic \nconditions), small cells, sodium growth requirement and seasonally-stable regime dominate in \nocean systems (Cushing, 1989; Schultz and Ducklow, 2000), while allochtonous material, high \nnutrient concentrations (mesotrophic and eutrophic conditions), large cells, high bacterial diversity, \nstrong-seasonal regime, steep physical, chemical and biological gradients are more important in \nestuarine ecosystems (Cushing, 1989; Rieman and Christoffersen, 1993; Thingstad et al., 1999; \nSchultz and Ducklow, 2000). In addition, physical factors as wind forcing and water circulation are \ncapable of changing estuarine conditions over a much smaller temporal scale than those occurring \nin the open ocean (Schultz and Ducklow, 2000). Moreover, the strong relationship between \nbacterial and primary production observed in the open ocean and in lakes (Cole et al., 1988; \nConnan et al., 1999) is not seen in estuarine systems (Ducklow and Kirchman, 1983; Wright and \nCoffin, 1984; Findlay et al., 1991; Ducklow and Shiah, 1993). This absence of strong links could \nbe due to differences in the metabolic capabilities of different bacterial communities found within \nthe estuary according to space and time (Schultz and Ducklow, 2000). \n\n\n\n \nIntroduction \n\n \n\n 3\n\n1.3. Diversity of bacterioplankton \nIn general it has been observed a relatively low bacterial diversity in aquatic environments \n\n(Rehnstam et al., 1993; Murray et al., 1998). Pinhassi et al. (2000) found that a limited number of \nindividual bacterial (typically 10 species) consistently represented the majority of the bacterial \ncommunity in different marine areas. Moreover, the denaturing gel electrophoresis technique, \nrecently applied to samples from aquatic environments, revealed a limited number of bands, while \nthe same technique applied to a soil microbial community revealed a very high diversity (Murray et \nal., 1996; Ovreas et al., 1997; Ovreas et al., 1998). A low or moderate bacterial diversity in aquatic \nsamples has also been derived from theoretical considerations based on the number of \nbacteriophages versus bacterial numbers (Thingstad and Lignell, 1997). In aquatic systems, viral \ndensity is high and this implies that each potential host must be present also at high concentrations \nin order to allow efficient virus propagation (Wiggins and Alexander, 1985; Wilcox and Fuhrman, \n1994). It was concluded that, in marine environments and at each site and moment, there is a \nlimited number of dominant bacterial species, refuting the hypothesis of the presence of an infinite \nnumber of species at high densities (Pinhassi et al., 2000). Moreover, it has been shown that most \nof the representative genera, widely distributed between different sea areas, show closely related \nisolates (Hagstrom et al., 2000). \n\nIn estuarine environments it is expected a high bacterial diversity due to the mixing of \nseawater and freshwater and the transportation of particles from many sources, including salt \nmarshes, mudflats, rivers and bottom sediments. Bible and Fletcher (1995) found that in the \nChesapeake Bay the free-living bacteria composition differed considerably in the upper- and mid-\nbay regions. Moreover, Bie et al. (2001) showed that the composition of microbial assemblages \nvaried along physical and chemical gradients. Murray et al. (1996) found that in two California \nestuaries the bacteria similarity in adjacent stations was greater than the similarity in distant \nstations. They suggested that differences in the quality of organic matter and in phytotypes along \ngradients may control the composition of bacterial assemblages. However, mixing of different \ncommunities may also contribute to the observed gradients (Murray et al.,1996). \n\nIt has been shown that bacterial composition of estuarine environments differ from oceanic \nwaters (Martinez et al., 1996; Hagstrom et al., 2000). Hagstrom et al. (2000) studied the bacterial \ncomposition from marine and estuarine areas and found that the bacterial community of the Baltic \nestuary had a different overall composition at the genus level when compared to the open sea areas. \nThe authors detected the lack of marine (salt tolerant) genera in the Northern Baltic and attributed \nthis to the low salinity observed in this area (&lt;10 psu). In fact, Hofle and Bretar (1995, 1996) \nfound the presence of Pseudomonas and Shewanella in the Baltic instead of species with salt \nrequirement for growth (i.e. Alteromonas, Roseobacter and Vibrio) detected in open sea areas. \nMoreover, Meth\u00e9 et al. (1998) found high abundance of ?-proteobacteria in freshwater lakes but \nthe lack of these organisms in the sea and suggested that the presence of these bacteria in coastal \n\n\n\n \nIntroduction \n\n \n\n4 \n\nenvironments could be used as a marker for terrigenous inputs of bacteria in coastal waters \n(Hobbie, 1988). These community differences could be explained, in part, by different \nrequirements for salt, but there are, probably, other factors determining the geographic distribution \nof different assemblages of bacterial species. Dynamic events like algal blooms, temperature \nchange and upwelling have been also referred as important factors in the changing of the structural \ncomposition of bacterial communities (Fukami et al., 1985; Hagstrom et al., 2000). \n\n \nDifferences in metabolic properties (e.g. bacterial production and substrate turnover) in \n\ndifferent aquatic areas can be related to the distribution of specific bacterial populations \n(Hollibaugh, 1994; Martinez et al., 1996; Murray et al., 1996, Pinhassi et al., 2000; Fandino et al., \n2001). In fact, Crump et al. (1999) found that the rapidly growing members of particle-attached \nestuarine bacteria were almost absent from the free-living or particle-attached bacteria of both \ncoastal and riverine waters. On the other hand, the free-living estuarine bacteria were similar either \nto river or coastal bacterial members. Additionally, it has been proved that the higher cell specific \nactivity of particle-attached-bacteria (Karmer and Herndl, 1992; Smith et al., 1992) derives from \nthe different phylogenetic identity of these bacteria when compared to free-living cells, rather than \nto substrate induction (DeLong et al., 1993; Acinas et al., 1999; Fandino et al., 2001). \n\n \n1.4. Bacterioplankton abundance and production \nSince the 1970`s it has become increasingly clear that bacterioplankton makes a significant \n\ncontribution to planktonic abundance (Holligan et al., 1984; del Giorgio and Cole, 1998;) and \nproductivity (Cole et al., 1988; Goosen et al., 1997) in aquatic systems. \n\nPhysical and chemical properties of the water column as well as the abundance and \nproductivity of the bacterial community vary in aquatic systems according to the temperature range \n(Heinanen and Kuparinen, 1991; Di Siervi et al., 1995), depth of the water column (Pace and Cole, \n1994; Talbot et al., 1997) and, in estuaries, with the proximity to the sea (Almeida and Alc\u00e2ntara, \n1992; Alc\u00e2ntara and Almeida, 1994; Goosen et al., 1995; Goosen et al., 1997; Kornas et al., 1998) \nand with tidal water circulation (Almeida and Alc\u00e2ntara, 1992; Shiah and Ducklow, 1995; Hoppe et \nal., 1996). In spite of the large ecological diversity among particular areas, common features of the \nbacterial community can be determined. Total and active bacterial numbers and productivity are \ngenerally highest in the warm season, in the photic zone, at the mid-upper estuarine sections as well \nas near low tide (Almeida and Alc\u00e2ntara, 1992; Alc\u00e2ntara and Almeida, 1994; Di Siervi et al., \n1995; Hoppe et al., 1996; Goosen et al., 1997). \n\n \n1.4.1. Profiles of bacterioplankton abundance (total and active bacteria) \nThe levels of bacterial abundance in various aquatic systems (usually in the order of 108 to \n\n109 cells l-1) are relatively invariant when compared to the variation over 4-5 orders of magnitude \n\n\n\n \nIntroduction \n\n \n\n 5\n\nin activity measurements (Chin-Leo and Brenner, 1992; del Giorgio et al., 1996; Hoppe et al., \n1996). Bacterial density, however, can vary greatly in different environments. Estuarine waters are \n1-3 orders of magnitude richer in bacterioplankton than the open ocean (Hall and Vincent, 1990; \nPomeroy et al., 1994; Bianchi and Giuliano, 1996; Talbot et al., 1997; Bouvy et al., 1998; Kornas \net al., 1998; Borsheim, 2000). Bacterial abundance in the ocean seldom exceeds 2 x 109 cells l-1, \nwhereas it commonly does so in estuaries (Ducklow, 1992). The lower limit of the range reported \nfor the open ocean reach values in the order of 107 cells l-1 (Hall and Vincent, 1990; Pomeroy et al., \n1994; Bianchi and Giuliano, 1996). The upper limit of the range has been observed in temperate \nestuaries and is in the order of 1010 cells l-1 (Hoppe et al., 1996; Amon and Brenner, 1998; Cunha et \nal., 2000). In the open ocean, bacterial abundance exhibits clear vertical profiles of variation \naccording to the decrease of cell density below the photic zone (Bianchi and Giuliano, 1996; \nBorsheim, 2000; Bode et al., 2001). In coastal waters, bacterial density is, in general, highest in \nsurface water (Heinanen, 1991) but in shallow estuarine systems bacterial abundance can be \nhomogeneous down the water column (reviewed by Ducklow and Shiah, 1993) or even higher near \nthe bottom (Amon and Benner, 1998). Total bacterial numbers in open oceanic waters and in \ncoastal waters decrease, in general, in the cold season by a factor of 4 to 14 relatively to the warm \nseason (Hoppe, 1978; Sommmaruga and Conde, 1997; Yanada et al., 2000). In estuarine systems, \ndistinct longitudinal profiles of variation are generally characterised by increases in bacterial \nabundance from the outer to the upper- (Palumbo and Fergunson, 1978; Goosen et al., 1997; \nKornas et al., 1998) or mid- (Wright and Coffin, 1983; Bordalo et al., 1998; Cunha et al., 2000) \nestuarine sections. In these systems the variation associated to tidal currents is generally \ncharacterised by increasing bacterial density near low tide compared to high tide (Shiah and \nDucklow, 1995; Hoppe et al., 1996). \n\n \nIt has been shown that only a fraction of the total bacterial number is metabolically active \n\n(del Giorgio et al., 1996; Ullrich et al., 1996; Sommaruga and Conde, 1997; Sherr et al., 1999; \nChoi et al., 1999; Bernan et al., 2001). Consequently, the total bacterial number may not be a \nuseful ecological parameter, since only the fraction of metabolically active bacteria are responsible \nfor growth, nutrient uptake and transformation of organic carbon substrates. On the other hand, this \nfraction may also be selectively grazed (Sherr et al., 1992; del Giorgio et al., 1996) or infected by \nviruses (Proctor and Fuhrman, 1990). Total bacterial numbers yield valuable information on \nstanding stock without however reflecting the real metabolic activity (review by Es Van and \nMayer-Reil, 1982). It is possible that the number of active cells is more variable among systems \nthan the total number of bacteria, and that this variation is masked by a rather large and constant \npool of inactive bacteria (del Giorgio and Scarborough, 1995). Therefore, it may be pertinent to \ndistinguish between active and inactive bacteria in an ecosystem. \n\n\n\n \nIntroduction \n\n \n\n6 \n\nSeveral methods have been developed to estimate the fraction of active bacteria in aquatic \nenvironments. Among them, those involving microscope direct counts (Tabor and Neihof, 1984; \nRodriguez et al., 1992) and, more recently, flow cytometry (Porter et al., 1995; Button et al., 1996) \nhave been preferred to the more complex and time-consuming microautoradiography procedure \n(Meyer-Reil, 1978; Tabor and Neihof 1982). Direct viable count methods, based on cell \nenlargement response, suffer however from methodological limitations when applied to natural \nsamples (Joux and LeBaron, 1997; Ullrich et al., 1999; Choi et al., 1999). Direct viable count \nmethods based on the addition of a single antibiotic (nalidix acid), or of an antibiotic cocktail, \nrequire the addition of supplementary substrates (yeast extract) and, when applied to complex \ncommunities have limitations due to the variable response of the different bacteria to the antibiotic, \nmaking the enlargement response difficult to evaluate (Thorsen et al., 1992). On the other hand, \ndirect methods based on determinations of the activity of the electron transport system, \npredominantly following the use of the tetrazolium salt 2-p-iodo-phenyl-3-p-nitrophenyl-5 \nphenyltetrazolium chloride (INT) (Zimmermann et al., 1978) and, more recently, of a fluorochrome \nversion, 5-cyano-2,3 ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC) (Rodriguez et al., 1992) underestimates the \nfraction of active bacteria (Ullrich et al., 1999; Choi et al., 1999). Underestimation is due to the \ntoxicity of the redox compound to bacteria (Ullrich et al., 1996) and to the fact that not all bacteria \ncan effectively reduce CTC (Smith and McFeters, 1997). More recently, other methods have been \nproposed to distinguish inactive from active bacteria using fluorogenic compounds, such as \nTOPRO-1, methods that identify non-viable cells with membrane and cell wall integrity \ncompromised (Williams et al., 1998). Universal 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes have \nbeen also used to identify bacterial cells as potentially metabolically active (Karmer and Fuhrman, \n1997). \n\nAlthough few studies have analysed in detail the variability of the abundance and \nproportion of active bacteria, the general pattern is that, despite the different methods used, in most \naquatic systems only a small fraction of bacteria is metabolically active (del Giorgio and \nScarborough, 1995; Zweifel and Hagstrom, 1995; Choi et al., 1999; Sherr et al., 1999). Data from \nthe literature compiled by del Giorgio and Scarborough (1995) indicate that the proportion of active \nbacteria increases from&lt;5% in the most oligotrophic open ocean areas to >50% in estuarine \nenvironments. Active bacterial number seems to vary considerably more than total number of \nbacteria. Over a broad range of aquatic systems, the active bacterial number varied by four orders \nof magnitude, whereas the number of total bacteria varied by three orders of magnitude (del \nGiorgio and Scarborough, 1995). Active bacteria number show a distinct minimum during the cold \nseason (about an order of magnitude bellow warm season values) but the annual variation in the \nfraction of active bacteria is not so distinct (Hoppe, 1978; Sommmaruga and Conde, 1997; Bernan \net al., 2001). The highest values of active bacteria number are frequently observed in surface water \n\n\n\n \nIntroduction \n\n \n\n 7\n\nbut the proportion of active bacteria either decreases with depth (Novitsky, 1983; Simek, 1986) or \nvaries irregularly down the water column (Bianchi and Giuliano, 1996). \n\n \nAlthough a large fraction of bacteria has been considered as metabolically inactive, it is \n\nwell known that inactive bacteria may be dead, dormant, or slowly growing (Morita, 1997; Schut et \nal., 1997; Sherr et al., 1999). Choi et al. (1999) demonstrated that a substantial fraction (30 to 85%) \nof the apparently inactive marine bacteria, in relation to the detected activity of the electron \ntransport system, can become active within 1 to 2 days after addition of organic matter and/or \nincrease of water temperature. Bernan et al. (2001) found also that some bacteria, which appear to \nbe inactive, can become active when stimulated by substrate addition, even though cell division is \ninhibited. This result suggests that a significant proportion of less active bacteria have the capacity \nto change their physiological state becoming metabolically active under favorable growth \nconditions. \n\n \n1.4.2. Profiles of bacterioplankton production \nBiomass production by heterotrophic bacteria is, from an ecological viewpoint, secondary \n\nproduction and reflects the overall bacterial response to the prevailing ecological conditions. The \ncurrent methods for measuring bacterial production are simple to perform and are a convenient way \nto follow bacterial growth over time (Bell and Kuparinen, 1984), or over changing geographical or \nlocal conditions (Pace and Cole, 1994). On the other hand, comparison of bacterial production and \nprimary production is a well-accepted indication of the trophic state of a system. It is known that \necosystems in which bacterial production is in excess of net primary production are dominated by \nallochthonous inputs of organic carbon and are decidedly heterotrophic. Contrarily, systems in \nwhich bacterial production is in deficit of net primary production are characterised as autotrophic \n(Cole and Pace, 1995). \n\nIn spite of the fact that only a small proportion of the total bacteria are active under natural \nconditions, their production in various aquatic environments has been found to average 20% of \nprimary production (Williams, 1981; Cole et al., 1988), and about twice the production of the \nmacrozooplankton (Cole et al., 1988). \n\nBiomass productivity by heterotrophic bacterioplankton in aquatic systems is in the range \nof 0.0003-26.2 \u00b5g C l-1 h-1 (Shiah and Ducklow, 1995; Jellett et al., 1996; Bouvy et al., 1998; Gasol \net al., 1998; Hoppe et al., 1998; Kisand and Noges, 1998, Shiah et al., 1999). In estuarine systems \nthe values are often high when compared to the adjacent coastal areas and open sea (Ducklow, \n1992; reviewed by Ducklow and Shiah, 1993; Di Siervi et al., 1995). Ducklow and Carlson (1992) \ncompilated data from various marine habitats and found means ranging from 1.8 to 5.6 \u00b5g C l-1 h-1 \nin estuaries and from 0.5 to 0.6 \u00b5g C l-1 h-1 in open ocean. The highest values have been registered \nduring summer months and the lowest during the winter in both estuarine and oceanic waters \n\n\n\n \nIntroduction \n\n \n\n8 \n\n(Kuosa and Kivi, 1989; Di Siervi et al., 1995). Vertical profiles of bacterial production in oceanic \nwaters have been characterised by decreasing values from surface to the deeper water layers (Jellet \net al., 1996; Talbot et al., 1997). In estuarine systems bacterial production is, in general, higher at \nsurface water (Heinanen, 1991; Fuks et al., 1994) but in shallow estuaries bacterial productivity \ncan be similar throughout the water column (Ducklow and Shiah, 1993) or even higher near the \nbottom sediment (Amon and Benner, 1998). It is most frequent bacterial productivity to increase up \nto 10 times from the lower to the mid-upper sections of the estuary (Goosen et al., 1997; Sanudo-\nWilhelmy and Taylor, 1999; Cunha et al., 2000). In these systems, the highest values of bacterial \nproductivity have been observed near low tide (Shiah and Ducklow, 1995; Hoppe et al., 1996; \nCunha et al., 2000). \n\n \nSeveral authors reported good correspondence between variations in bacterial and primary \n\nproduction in several ecosystems (Kuosa and Kivi, 1989; Fuks et al., 1994; Lignell, 1990; \nPanzenbock et al., 2000). Cole et al. (1988) examined the data from 70 studies on production of \nbacterial biomass, and found that bacterial production was 20% of primary production, on a \nvolumetric basis. This value agrees well with the earlier estimation by Williams (1981) and with \nother direct studies in lakes and marine systems (Reinheimer, 1981; Fernandez et al., 1994; Connan \net al., 1999; Panzenbock et al., 2000). When the entire water column is considered, bacterial \nproduction is more significant, averaging 31% of primary production in the data from the 70 \nreferred studies in lakes and coastal marine systems (Cole et al., 1988). In deep water columns \nwhere the depth is many times greater than the photic zone, the importance of bacterial production \nmay be higher (Cole et al., 1988). On shorter time and space scales the ratio of bacterial production \nto primary production can, however, vary greatly (Bano et al., 1997; Witek et al., 1997; Bano et \nal., 1998; Shiah et al., 2001). Depth profiles of secondary and primary production were found to \ncorrespond poorly (Pace and Cole, 1994). Changes in bacterial and phytoplankton production \nwithin years were not closely related (Hoch and Kirchman, 1993) although total values covaried \nover the years Cole et al., 1988).  \n\n \n2. Factors of variation of bacterioplankton growth \nSince a large fraction of carbon in aquatic systems is now thought to flow through bacteria, \n\nthe knowledge of the factors controlling bacterioplankton production is relevant to the \nunderstanding of biogeochemical cycles functioning and, particularly, to the prediction of their \nevolution after perturbation. \n\nThe main factors regulating bacterial growth include different variables namely nutritional \n(availability of organic and inorganic substrates), physical (e.g. temperature, water circulation), \nchemical (e.g. salinity), and biological (predation and viral lysis). Surprisingly, however, the \n\n\n\n \nIntroduction \n\n \n\n 9\n\nqualitative and quantitative relationships among these factors are still poorly understood (Shiah and \nDucklow, 1995; Dufour and Torr\u00e9ton, 1996; Pomeroy and Wiebe, 2001). \n\n \n2.1 Availability of organic and inorganic nutrients \nSubstrate supply has long been recognized as a dominant factor in regulating \n\nbacterioplankton abundance and production in aquatic systems (Ducklow and Carlson, 1992; \nFuhrman, 1992; Shiah et al., 1999). Several studies have suggested, however, that the strength of \nthe bottom-up control might be system- dependent and might also change within a system (Wiebe \net al., 1992; Ducklow and Shiah, 1993; Bernan et al., 1994; Shiah and Ducklow, 1995; Shiah et al., \n1999). \n\nThe strong positive correlation between phytoplankton and bacterioplankton biomass and \nbacterial production usually observed in field and enclosure studies suggests that phytoplankton \nmay be an important autochthonous source of bacterial growth substrates (Williams, 1990; White et \nal., 1991, Panzenbock et al., 2000). Phytoplankton can directly supply bacteria with organic matter, \nthrough exudation from healthy cells and lysis of senescent and dead cells (Vadstein et al., 1993; \nPanzenbock et al., 2000). Indirect supply occurs via viral lysis or grazing by herbivorous \nzooplankton (Peduzzi and Herndl, 1992; Stom et al., 1997; Bratbak et al., 1998; Noble and \nFuhrman, 1999; Hasegawa et al., 2000). \n\nIn coastal and estuarine systems, bacterial growth substrates frequently derive from \nadditional sources such as river transported materials, terrestrial runoff, antropogenic discharges, \nbenthic fluxes and sediment resuspension. It has been found that non-phytoplankton or \nallochthonous organic matter supplies mediate, to a large extent, bacterioplankton growth in coastal \nand estuarine systems (Lee et al., 2001). Findlay et al. (1992), for example, estimated that the \namount of allochthonous carbon inputs needed to support bacterial productivity in the Hudson \nEstuary was three to six times greater than the net carbon fixed by phytoplankton. Other authors \n(Coveney and Wetzel, 1995) arrived at identical conclusion with respect to Lawrence Lake. The \noriginal allochthonous compounds had undergone, however, partial degradation and transformation \nbefore entering the aquatic system, and were thus less labile than the autochthonous substrates \noriginated from phytoplankton production (Hobbie, 1988). It has been suggested therefore that \nallochthonous organic matter provide stability to bacterioplankton, in the sense that the large pool \nof recalcitrant organic matter supports continuous slow growth, independent of the intermittent \ngrowth associated with the less constant presence of autochthonous labile organic matter (Wetzel, \n1984; Hobbie, 1988). \n\nThe concentration of inorganic substrates is also a factor of control of bacterial production \n(Toolan et al., 1991; Thingstad et al., 1993; Torr\u00e9ton et al., 2000; Ferrier-Pag\u00e8s and Furla, 2001). It \nis not yet clear, however, to what extent the inorganic or organic substrates may limit \nbacterioplankton production (Toolan et al., 1991). While availability of organic carbon has \n\n\n\n \nIntroduction \n\n \n\n10 \n\ntraditionally been thought of as a key factor in the limitation of bacterial growth, the high inorganic \nnutrients requirements (Vadstein et al., 1988) and the high percentage of uptake traceable to \nbacteria (Currie and Kalff, 1984) suggest that the inorganic nutrients supply could also limit \nbacterial abundance and production. In fact, several studies have shown that bacterial growth \nincreases with increasing availability in inorganic nutrients (Kroer, 1993; Pace and Cole, 1996; \nWikner et al., 1999; Torr\u00e9ton et al., 2000). Moreover, heterotrophic bacteria have been shown to \ncompete successfully with phytoplankton for inorganic nutrients (Currie and Kalff, 1984; \nThingstad et al., 1993). Blackburn et al. (1998) showed that bacteria have nutrient uptake potentials \naround 100 times faster than that of phytoplankton. At low concentrations, the competitive \nadvantage of bacterioplankton over phytoplankton for inorganic nutrients is a consensual idea \n(Dufour and Berland, 1999; Torr\u00e9ton et al., 2000). \n\n \n2.2 Water properties \nThe growth of bacteria in aquatic systems is affected by in situ temperature, as concluded \n\nfrom the generally found positive correlation between bacterial production and temperature (Shiah \nand Ducklow, 1994; Kirchman and Rich, 1997; Shiah and Ducklow, 1997). It has been shown that \nthe different temperature optima for bacterioplankton growth reflect the in situ temperature range \n(Simon and Wunsch, 1998). Recent studies have demonstrated that the variation in the rates of \nbacterial activity in eutrophic and mesotrophic ecosystems might primarily be regulated by \ntemperature, with substrate supply playing a lesser role (Bernan et al., 1994; Griffith et al., 1994; \nShiah and Ducklow, 1995). In oligotrophic systems the reverse situation occurs, with substrate \nsupply playing a higher role on regulation of bacterial growth than temperature (Shiah et al., 1999). \nWiebe and Pomeroy (1992) have clearly demonstrated reciprocal interactions of temperature and \nsubstrate concentration in the control of bacterial growth: bacteria could grow rapidly at low \n(<10\u00b0C) temperature and high (micromolar) substrate concentration, or at high (>10\u00b0C) \ntemperature and low (nanomolar) substrate concentrations, but not at low temperatures and low \nsubstrate concentration. \n\n \nSalinity acts as a selecting agent of the bacterial strains that may proliferate in an \n\necosystem (Campbell, 1983; Rheinheimer, 1985). For example, bacteria with a salt requirement for \ngrowth will not be able to grow in estuarine environments with a large impact of freshwater \n(Campbell, 1983). On the other hand, it is unlikely that inflowing freshwater bacterial populations \nmay survive within an estuary (Vald\u00e9s and Albright, 1981; Painchaud et al., 1987). Stahl et al. \n(1992) showed that phylogenetically distinct species of Caulobacter occur in freshwater when \ncompared to saline environments. In estuarine systems, in general, bacterioplankton exhibit higher \nabundance and activity at low salinities with decreasing values towards higher salinity values \n(Palumbo and Fergunson, 1978; Murrell et al., 1999). Peaks of bacterial abundance and activity \n\n\n\n \nIntroduction \n\n \n\n 11\n\nmay occur, however, at intermediate salinities (Wright and Coffin, 1983; Fuks et al., 1991; Chin-\nLeo and Benner, 1992; Cunha et al., 2000). \n\n \nIt is well known that phytoplankton is negatively affected by high light intensities \n\nprevailing at the surface water, but there are only a few reports of light effects on bacterioplankton. \nPhotoinhibion of heterotrophic bacteria has been reported (Pakulsky et al., 1998; Pausz and Herndl, \n1999; Mousseau et al., 2000). Herndl et al. (1993) found that bacterial production at the Adriatic \nSea surface was inhibited by UV-radiation up to 40 %. The authors observed that this inhibition \ncould be detected down to 5 m. Bacteria below the photic zone were as sensitive to light as bacteria \nin the euphotic zone, suggesting that bacteria are, in general, not adapted to UV-radiation (Lindell \nand Edling, 1996). However, in spite of the decrease bacterial activity by photoinhibition, \nphotolysis of recalcitrant organic matter can stimulate bacterial growth (Wetzel et al., 1995; Miller \nand Moran, 1997; Bano et al., 1997; Bushaw-Newton and Moran, 1999). \n\nIt has been found that UV-radiation can reduce phytoplankton photosynthesis (Helbling et \nal., 1996a) and growth (Jokiel and York, 1984), enhance phytoplankton exudation (Zlotnik and \nDubinsky, 1989; Feuillade et al., 1990) and even modify the structure of the phytoplankton \ncommunity (Helbling et al., 1996b). Contrarily to bacteria, phytoplankton may respond to light \nstress with different strategies including decrease of metabolism, increase in the production of \nprotective pigments and by migration to deeper water (Karentz et al., 1994). \n\nSolar irradiation, on the other hand, is a major cause of decline in viral infectivity in \nsurface waters (Wommack et al., 1996; Noble and Fuhrman, 1997), reducing virus-mediated \nmortality of bacterio- and phytoplankton. \n\nThe indirect effects of light on the bacterioplankton are certainly complex. \n \n2.3. Water circulation \nThe circulation of estuarine water is driven by a complex interplay of mechanisms, all of \n\nwhich have been shown to be important in regulating biological processes (Painchaud et al., 1987; \nDucklow and Shiah, 1993). Circulation is capable of changing the conditions of the ecosystem over \na much smaller temporal scale than that occurring in the open ocean (Schultz and Ducklow, 2000). \nIn estuarine systems circulation may have a large effect on the abundance and production of the \nbacterial community as it supplies allochthonous organic matter, concentrates and conserves within \nthe estuary locally produced organic matter and provides mechanisms for longer-term coupling of \nbacterial production and authochonous sources of organic matter (Ducklow and Shiah, 1993). \n\nIn estuaries, water circulation is conditioned by tidal currents, river discharges and wind. \nTidal currents move plankton populations back and forward creating complex circulation patterns. \nFor example, Wright and Coffin (1983) studied bacterial distribution in the Essex estuary and \nshowed a peak in abundance in the mid-estuary, flanked by lower numbers up- and downstream. \n\n\n\n \nIntroduction \n\n \n\n12 \n\nThe authors explained this pattern of variation as due to the tidal regime which allowed bacterial \npopulations to be retained within the estuary over several tidal cycles, and exposed them to contact \nwith enriched salt marsh waters. Tidal currents also interfere with vertical distribution patterns in \nestuaries. Tidal currents can, for example, destratify the water column (Haas, 1977), stimulating \ntotal bacterial production (Ducklow, 1982). \n\n \n2.4 Mortality through infection and predation \nThe discovery that the abundance of free viruses (&lt;107 to > 1011 viruses l-1) can exceed \n\nthat of planktonic bacteria by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude (Proctor and Fuhrman, 1990; Jiang and \nPaul, 1994; Maranger and Bird, 1995; Weinbauer and Peduzzi, 1995a) motivated the research \neffort on the impact of viral infection on aquatic microorganisms. \n\nNumerous studies on a wide variety of aquatic ecosystems have indicated that \nbacteriophages can be important in controlling bacterial growth (Proctor and Fuhrman, 1991; \nBratbak et al., 1992; Fuhrman and Noble, 1995; Maranger and Bird, 1995; Weinbauer and Peduzzi, \n1995b). It has been shown that up to 30% of planktonic bacteria were infected by litic viruses \n(Fuhrman and Suttle, 1993; Suttle, 1994). Estimates of bacterial mortality due to viral lysis \nindicated that phages can be responsible for as little as 1% up to 100% of the observed bacterial \nmortality (Proctor and Fuhrman, 1991; Bratbak et al., 1992; Steward et al., 1992; Bratbak et al., \n1993; Proctor et al., 1993; Suttle, 1994; Fuhrman and Noble, 1995; Hennes et al., 1995; Weinbauer \nand Peduzzi, 1995b), depending on environmental conditions and host community structure \n(reviewed by Wommack and Colwell, 2000). In coastal waters the virus-mediated bacterial \nmortality was estimated to represent a value similar to grazing by protozoa (Fuhrman and Noble, \n1995). Likewise, in an eutrophic lake, viruses caused large bacterial mortality and their \ncontribution to mortality increased with depth since protozoa were absent in the anoxic zone \n(Weinbauer and Hofle, 1998). \n\nViruses may also influence the structure of bacterial communities since they are host \nspecific (Suttle et al., 1990; Thingstad et al., 1993; Wommack et al., 1999). Additionally, viruses \nmay influence bacterial diversity at the genetic level since they can mediate genetic exchange via \ntransduction (Miller and Sayler, 1992; Paul, 1999). \n\nAlthough the proportion of bacteriophages in the total virioplankton is not known, many \nauthors have speculated that bacteriophages comprise the majority of the virioplankton population. \nIn fact, in aquatic systems viruses are, in general, strongly correlated with bacterioplankton density \n(Heldal and Bratback, 1991; Maranger and Bird, 1995, Steward et al., 1996) and the virioplankton \ndensity has been found to be higher when bacterial productivity is also higher (Steward et al., 1996; \nWeinbauer and Hofle, 1998). \n\n \n\n\n\n \nIntroduction \n\n \n\n 13\n\nIn aquatic systems, predation has been reported as a major mortality factor in bacterial \ncommunities (Weisse, 1997; Weisse and Muller, 1998). Heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates \nare the most important grazers of bacteria in both marine (Sherr et al., 1989; Wikner et al., 1990) \nand freshwater systems (Bloem et al., 1989; Sanders et al., 1989). Several studies have shown that \ngrazing by protists influences both cell size distribution (Simek et al., 1997; Hahn and Hofle, 1998) \nand the taxonomic structure (Simek et al., 1997; Hanhn and Hofle, 1998, Suzuki, 1999) of the \nbacterial community. \n\nGrazing rates have been observed to be higher on active than on inactive bacteria (Sherr et \nal., 1992; del Giorgio et al., 1996) and on motile bacteria than on non-motile bacteria (Gonz\u00e1lez et \nal., 1993). Furthermore, protists selected their prey based on size (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 1990; Pernthalen \net al., 1996; Gonz\u00e1lez, 1999) controlling, in this way, the size distribution of the bacterioplankton. \nSize selective grazing has been shown to result in an increased dominance of small cells that escape \npredation (Anderson et al., 1986) or, after periods of intensive grazing, in an increased dominance \nof larger cells, since these cells are difficult to ingest by a small flagelattes (Pernthaler et al., 1996; \nHahn et al., 1999; Jurgens et al., 1999). Estimates of bacterial mortality due to predation in aquatic \nsystems have been reported to range from 10 to 80% (Solic and Krstulovic, 1994; Fuhrman and \nNoble, 1995; Gonz\u00e1lez, 1999; Ferrier-Pag\u00e8s and Furla, 2001) depending on environmental and \nbiological variables (Vaqu\u00e9 et al., 1994). \n\n \n \n3. Thesis outline \n \nThis work is focused on the trophic processes of the water column of Ria de Aveiro and on \n\nthe factors underlying the shape of the spatial and temporal profiles of bacterioplankton activity in \nthis ecosystem. \n\nIn order to interpret the functioning of an ecosystem one has to approach the interplay of \nphysical, chemical and biological processes and the interaction of the different compartments of the \nsystem. It is essential, in particular, to evaluate the different factors that may control the fluxes of \nmaterials and energy. \n\nIt is well recognized that bacteria play an important role in driving the fluxes of carbon and \nnutrients and that they exert a relevant control on microbial food webs (Azam, 1998; Pomeroy and \nWeibe, 1998). \n\nThe characterisation of longitudinal profiles of estuarine waters is fundamental in order to \nestablish a general outline for the rational underlying the imports and exports between the estuary \nand the sea, putting in evidence some of the factors that control these profiles. \n\n\n\n \nIntroduction \n\n \n\n14 \n\nIn estuarine systems, strong tidal currents may act as a major determinant of \nbacterioplankton distribution. Tidal currents may increase seston concentration and, consequently, \ndecrease light penetration restricting primary production and, in turn, bacterial production. \n\nIn the case of Ria de Aveiro, a shallow system, the stratification of the water column is \nmostly unnoticeable even in the deeper zone. In fact, the difference in salinity and temperature \nvalues between surface and bottom, when existing, is very small (Moreira et al., 1993). The Ria de \nAveiro is characterised as a well-mixed estuary (Pritchard, 1967). The bacterioplankton may, \nhowever, follow or not the general pattern of the system. \n\nDissolved organic carbon released by the phytoplankton, mainly at the senescence phase, \nhas been reported as the best source of organic matter for bacterial growth (Wetzel, 1984; Hobbie, \n1988; Malinsky-Rushansky and Legrand, 1996). In some estuaries, however, other carbon sources, \nfor example allochthonous inputs, may be equally available for the bacterioplankton. \nAllochthonous inputs will tend, in this case, to uncouple bacterial abundance and production from \nphytoplankton abundance and primary production, affecting the natural pattern of the two \ncommunities. Bacterioplankton abundance and distribution follows then the occurrence of natural \nand allochthonous sources of carbon and nutrients. In estuarine systems it is relevant to take into \naccount not only river discharges but also the diffuse inputs and runoff from the banks surrounding \nthe system. \n\nIn shallow systems, as the case of Ria de Aveiro, the benthic compartment may also be an \nimportant source of organic matter and inorganic nutrients by simple diffusion. In fact, estuarine \nsediments are considered a privileged compartment for the deposition, accumulation and \nmineralisation of locally produced and deposited organic matter. On the other hand, transfer by \nsimple advection or after sediment resuspension linked to erosion by tidal currents or to \nbioturbation may enrich the water column with bacteria, particulate materials and nutrients. \n\n \nExperimental research is frequently required in order to clarify hypothesis on the biological \n\nprocesses underlying the trophic processes observed in aquatic systems. For instance, the fraction \nof active bacteria in marine communities seems to vary widely in different systems (del Giorgio \nand Scarborough, 1995) with important and foreseeable effects on organic matter recycling but the \nreasons for this variability is not yet clear. On the other hand, a variable fraction of the non-active \nbacteria are still viable, and may be activated at different times through metabolic adaptation or \nthrough suitable stimulation. The experimental approach to the environmental conditioning of \nbacterial viability may explain not only the different status of the bacterioplankton in different \ncommunities and also clarify the ranking of factors inducing positive or negative responses in a \nparticular community. \n\nThe effect of long residence time of estuarine water on the differentiation and adaptation of \nthe mixed marine and freshwater bacterial populations has not been translated into the question of \n\n\n\n \nIntroduction \n\n \n\n 15\n\nthe presence or not of true brackish water communities. This may possibly be addressed under a \nwell-controlled experimental set up. \n\nThe viral impact on bacterial mortality in sea- and brackish water, a subject that deserves \nattention since 1989, is mostly dependent on manipulation of the two communities under \nexperimental conditions (Peduzzi and Weinbauer, 1993; Weinbauer and Peduzzi 1995a). \n\n \nThe knowledge of the functional responses of an ecosystem to natural or \n\nanthropogenic factors may allow the prediction of natural tendencies linked to the \nalterations in its trophic status as well as the possible effects of specific interventions. In \nthe case of Ria de Aveiro, a system with considerable anthropogenic influence, a database \nof relevant parameters defining the functioning and the reactivity of the ecosystem to \nphysical and chemical perturbations may be important in predicting and evaluating the \nrange of possible effects and in avoiding undesired impacts. Natural or managing problems \nlike massive release of nutrients during storms, increased eutrophication, and dredging \nmay be equated at the light of experimental findings. It is known that dredging operations \nare frequently carried out in the estuary of Ria de Aveiro and that these activities interfere \nwith the quality of the water column (Almeida and Alc\u00e2ntara, 1992). It has also been \nobserved that the bacterial community in the bottom sediment is two to three orders of \nmagnitude denser than in the water column (Almeida and Alc\u00e2ntara, 1992; Alc\u00e2ntara et al., \n1996). Although bacterial productivity in the sediment is not yet determined in this system, \nit was observed that, in a per volume basis, the rate of oxygen consumption in the sediment \nwas 9 to 70 times higher than in the water column (Cunha et al., 1999). It is foreseeable \nthat sediment resuspension during dredging, besides affecting the zoobenthos, will increase \nnot only water turbidity but also bacterioplankton activity in the water column and organic \ncarbon turnover. This will interfere with the natural pattern of bacterioplankton variation. \nThe expected positive effects of the sanitary outfall under construction, on the quality of \nthe Ria de Aveiro system may be followed in order to evaluate the capacity of the system \nfor auto-depuration and as a test for present predictions. The sanitary outfall will discharge \nhigh numbers of freshwater bacteria and high levels of organic matter in the nearshore \nwaters. In an ecological perspective, it will be interesting to investigate if freshwater \nbacteria, when suddenly discharged in the nearshore will be able to degrade the particulate \nand dissolved organic matter of the effluent, driving these materials through the microbial \nfood web to higher trophic levels. \n\n \nObjectives of the work: \n\n1. To characterize the variability of the bacterial density (total and active bacteria) and \nproductivity in the water column of the estuary. \n\n\n\n \nIntroduction \n\n \n\n16 \n\nN\n\nN1\n\nI2\n\nI4\n\nI6\n\nI8 Rio Boco\n\nFigure 1: Ria de Aveiro with sampling \nstations indicated by arrows. Station N1, \nin Canal de Navega\u00e7\u00e3o, is in the marine \nzone of the ecosystem. I2, I4, I6 and I8 \nare brackish water stations along the \nsalinity gradient of Canal de \u00cdlhavo. Rio \nBoco is a river station. \n\n2. To determine the relative importance of autochthonous primary production and allochthonous \norganic inputs as sources of organic matter to bacterioplankton growth. \n\n3. To investigate the response of the bacterial community to periodic changes in salinity and \nnutrient availability. \n\n4. To evaluate the effect of viral infection as a factor of bacterioplankton loss and to determine \nhow it compares with the predation pressure. \n\n5. To investigate the trophic effects of sediment resuspension and runoff on bacterioplankton \nactivity. \n\n \nTo achieve these objectives several field and experimental studies were undertaken. \n \nField-work \nField research in the marine and in the brackish water zones of the estuary was driven in \n\norder to determine longitudinal, vertical, transversal, and \ntidal profiles of bacterioplankton and phytoplankton \nabundance and production, virioplankton abundance as \nwell as accompanying physical and chemical \nparameters. \n\nThe marine zone encompasses a water volume \nof 31.2 Mm3 (26% of the total water volume) and has a \nmaximum depth of 20 m at the mouth of the estuary. In \nthis work, the marine zone was represented by station \nN1 (figure 1), located in the Canal de Navega\u00e7\u00e3o. The \nchosen location - 2 Km from the mouth - avoids most of \nthe water turbulence and traffic that exists closer to the \nmouth of the estuary and the strong currents that would \nrisk the instrumental readings and sample collection. On \nthe other hand, this location allows the better detection \nof the effects of transport of particulate and dissolved \nmaterials coming from the brackish sections. In order to \nput in evidence eventual stratification and local \nresuspension of sediments in the marine zone, \nmeasurements were performed during the warm season \nat four different depths (0.2 m below surface, 4.5, 2.5 \nand 0.5 m above sediment surface) along six spring and \nneap tidal cycles. During the cold season the sampling \neffort was reduced. Water sampling at 0.2 m below \n\n\n\n \nIntroduction \n\n \n\n 17\n\nsurface was performed only at slack water (high tide and low tide). \nThe brackish water zone encompasses a water volume of 88.6 Mm3 (74% of the total water \n\nvolume). The mid- and inner estuary is flat, shallow (average depth of 1 m) and generally flanked \nby salt marshes and mud flats. In order to assess the relative impact of flooding and runoff as well \nas of sediment resuspension in this zone, vertical and transversal profiles of bacterioplankton \nabundance and activity were studied and characterised. The brackish water zone was represented \nby station I6 (figure 1) located in the Canal de \u00cdlhavo. This Channel is one of the five main \nchannels in the Ria. Its location is very convenient as it follows the direction of the water current \npassing station N1. It has an easy access from the margins, is relatively calm, is not too deep and it \nis not far from the laboratory. The sediments along this channel vary from sandy to silty what \nmakes possible to study resuspension and runoff in different geological conditions. Measurements \nwere performed at two depths (0.2 m below surface and 0.5 m above sediment) along a transect \nestablished between the east margin (close to a salt marsh) and the center of the channel. The study \ninvolved four tidal cycles during spring and neap tides in the warm season. In the cold months, this \nstation was also sampled at slack water but only at the center of the channel and at 0.2 m below \nsurface. \n\nDuring the warm season, bacterio-, virio- and phytoplankton abundance and production \nwere studied along a longitudinal gradient of salinity, extending across the outer- mid and upper \nsections of the estuary. Six sampling stations, including stations N1 and I6, spaced regularly at 3 \nkm were established along the longitudinal gradient (figure 1). Station N1 and station I2 in the \nCanal de Navega\u00e7\u00e3o, stations I4, I6 and I8 in the Canal de \u00cdlhavo and also Rio Boco. Samples were \ncollected only at low tide and high tide, at the center of the channels, and close to the surface (0.2 \nm below surface). \n\n \nExperimental approaches \nThe interpretation of some of the results obtained in fieldwork was subjected to \n\nexperimental verification. \nLaboratory experiments were performed to characterise the viability state of the \n\nbacterioplankton through stimulation with organic and inorganic nutrients. The number of active \nbacteria and their proportion in the total bacterial community were determined after brief (10 \nminutes) or long (up to 3 hours) pre-exposure to low concentrations of organic and inorganic \ncompounds followed by staining with CTC.  \n\nAlso, the effects of the changes in salinity and other water properties on bacterial activity \nduring tidal transport were studied in laboratory assays, in diffusion chambers. One same \npopulation (marine population from station N1 or estuarine population from station I6) was \nexposed to changed environmental conditions in the presence of the contrasting water (water from \nthe other station). In each case, bacterial abundance (total and active bacteria) and productivity \n\n\n\n \nIntroduction \n\n \n\n18 \n\nwere measured after 2, 4 and 6 hours of exposure and compared with the initial characteristics of \nthe water and with the unchanged control. In order to test the effects of reversion exposure, an extra \nsample of each zone was incubated in the contrasting water for the first 2 hours, and then \ntransferred to its natural environment. Incubation for an additional 4 hours period revealed the \nresponse to the reversed conditions. To evaluate the effects of increased salinity on bacteria, \nsamples from stations N1 and I6 were exposed to natural brackish water conditions (18 psu), as \nwell as to the same water after adding of NaCl to a final salinity of 34 psu, similar to that of the \nmarine zone. \n\nThe potential contributions of viral infection and predation to bacterial mortality was \nassayed in an artificial microcosm set-up on six combinations of plankton variables affecting the \npresence/absence of predators, viruses-to-bacteria ratio, viruses-to-bacteria distance and bacterial \ngrowth rate. The number of bacteria was determined after 6, 12 and 24 hours of incubation and \ncompared with the initial values of bacterial density. \n\n \nVertical and tidal profiles obtained at stations N1 and I6 were compared and the factors \n\ninfluencing bacterial abundance and productivity were identified (chapter 2). \nThe contribution of primary production versus allochthonous carbon to bacterioplankton \n\ngrowth was studied along the longitudinal gradient of salinity during the warm season. In the cold \nseason the study was restricted to stations N1 and I6 (chapter 3). \n\nFieldwork data of bacterial abundance and activity obtained during the tidal cycles in both \nzones were compared with experimental work of bacterial stimulation assays and of diffusion \nchambers experiments in order to test whether a single, largely adaptable community exist in the \nestuary, or several distinct communities can be recognized (chapter 4). \n\nVertical, longitudinal and tidal profiles of virioplankton abundance were determined and \ncompared with those of bacterioplankton. The impact of the virioplankton on the bacterial \ncommunity was assayed in a laboratory microcosm set-up and compared with that of predation \n(chapter 5). \n\nThe vertical profiles of bacteriological, chemical and physical parameters were analysed \nfor evidence of sediment resuspension during tidal cycles at stations N1 and I6. Runoff from salt \nmarshes was also investigated but only in the brackish water area. In this area, transversal profiles \nof bacterioplankton abundance (total and particle-attached bacteria) and productivity were \ncompared with the profiles of seston, particulate organic carbon, chlorophyll and dissolved organic \ncarbon in order to evaluate the impact of runoff from salt marshes (chapter 6). \n\n\n\n \nFactors influencing bacterial production \n\n \n\n 19\n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \nFACTORS INFLUENCING BACTERIAL PRODUCTION IN A SHALLOW \n\nESTUARINE SYSTEM \n \n\nAlmeida MA, Cunha MA and Alc\u00e2ntara F \n \n\nDepartamento de Biologia - Universidade de Aveiro \nCampus Universit\u00e1rio de Santiago, 3810-193 AVEIRO, PORTUGAL \n\n_______________________________________________________________________________ \nABSTRACT: The bacterioplankton of the marine and brackish water zones of the complex system Ria de \nAveiro was characterised as profiles of bacterial abundance and biomass productivity. During the warm \nseason, total bacteria ranged from 0.2 to 8.5 x 109 cells l-1 and active bacteria number from 0.1 to 3.1 x 109 \ncells l-1. Total and active bacterial numbers were, on average, 3 times higher in brackish than in marine water. \nBacterial productivity  on different dates and different  tides in the marine zone varied from 0.05 to 4.5 \u00b5g C \nl-1 h-1. Here the average productivity (1.1 \u00b5g C l-1 h-1) was 3.5 times less than in brackish water (average 3.8 \n\u00b5g C l-1 h-1; range 0.7-14.2 \u00b5g C l-1 h-1). Specific productivity per cell varied from 0.05 to 2.61 fg C cell-1 h-1, \na range that was similar throughout the ecosystem. However, specific productivity per active cell was 19% \nhigher in brackish water. Bacterial production variation was best explained by the number of active bacteria, \nwhich, in turn, was highly associated with total bacterial number, temperature and particulate organic carbon. \nIn the marine zone, bacterial production was also influenced by depth and salinity. In the brackish zone, the \nset of independent variables explained a smaller percentage of bacterial production variation than in marine \nzone, suggesting greater importance of other variables. In the marine zone, and mainly near low tide, \nproductivity was significantly higher (average 3.3 times) at the surface (down to 0.5 m) than in the deeper \nlayers of the water column. This stratification of bacterial productivity was linked to the increased specific \nproductivity per active cell, as no modification in the proportion of active cells in the population could be \ndetected. The vertical profile of bacterial production in the deeper zone of this estuarine ecosystem, in which \nno clear salinity or thermal stratification occurs throughout the tidal cycle, seemed to reflect a biochemical \nstratification generated by increased phytoplankton exudation and/or by photochemical transformation of \nsemi-labile or recalcitrant organic compounds. Shallower water masses tend to blur this surface effect. The \nrelative importance of photochemical transformation in the pattern of estuarine bacterial production will \ntherefore tend to vary with the bathymetry of the system. \n\n_______________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \nINTRODUCTION \n\nIt is well known that the distribution and intensity of bacterial biomass production in \nestuaries depend on the location and size of carbon and nutrient sources, and on profiles of physical \nand chemical characteristics of the environment associated with water currents (15, 16, 22, 23, 28, \n34). Autochthonous organic matter is liberated by a variety of processes including phytoplankton \nexcretion and mortality (14, 17), zooplankton feeding (30, 37, 39), bacterial mortality (21, 31, 44) \nand detrital hydrolysis (7). Several studies indicate that the organic matter excreted by \nphytoplankton is very labile and subjected to high turnover rates by heterotrophic bacteria (20, 24). \nCole et al. (13) suggested that approximately half the carbon released by phytoplankton is \nprocessed by bacteria. Even so, labile organic matter is frequently accumulated in aquatic systems \n(41). This may happen, for instance, when bacteria compete with phytoplankton for inorganic \nnutrients (38). On the other hand, organic matter produced in marine ecosystems may exhibit low \nbiological lability when it includes chemical structures that require complex ectoenzymatic \nhydrolysis (2) or physico-chemical transformation. Photochemical transformation has been \n\n\n\n \nFactors influencing bacterial production \n\n \n\n20 \n\nidentified as an important process in substrate modification (3, 9, 11). Bano et al. (3) observed that \nexposure of water samples to natural or simulated daylight, increased bacterial use of organic \nmatter by 300%, and that humic substances were the principal carbon source for the additional \nbacterial growth. Bushaw-Newton &amp; Moran (9) also demonstrated that humic substances irradiated \nwith natural sunlight supported enhanced bacterial growth due to the increased availability of both \ncarbon and nitrogen. In comparative studies of bioavailability, natural humic substances from near-\nsurface water showed the same quality as carbon sources for bacteria as DOC (10). It has also been \nobserved that humic substances in surface water are significantly better sources of carbon and \nnitrogen for bacteria than those from deep water (10). \n\nAllochthonous organic matter, particularly in coastal systems, is an important substrate \nsupply for bacterioplankton (5, 27), its importance increasing, in general, when the volume of the \nwater body decreases (40). We have determined (unpublished data) for the shallow estuary of Ria \nde Aveiro, that phytoplankton was potentially sufficient to support the whole bacterial production \nduring the warm season but not during the cold months. Allochthonous carbon seemed, however, to \ncontribute a significant fraction of the bacterial production even during the warm season. \n\nIn order to understand the variation of bacterial production within a shallow estuarine \nsystem we compared information derived from longitudinal and vertical profiles in different tidal \nphases. \n\n \n \n \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n \nStudy site \n\nRia de Aveiro (Figure 1) is a tidal lagoon on the western coast of Portugal, connected to the \nAtlantic by a narrow opening. The lagoon covers an area of 66 and 83 km2 at low and high tide, \nrespectively (35). It exchanges with the sea a volume of water of 89 Mm3 in tides of 1 to 3 m \namplitude (35). Several rivers carry fresh water into the lagoon with an average water input of 1.8 \nMm3 during a tidal cycle (4). The Ria has a complex topography, with different channels spreading \nfrom the mouth towards the different streams, forming a complex estuarine ecosystem. In this \nstudy, we compared one station in the main channel ? Canal de Navega\u00e7\u00e3o (station N1) ? \nrepresenting the marine zone of the system (MZ), with station I6, a brackish water station in the \nCanal de \u00cdlhavo (a secondary channel), which represents the brackish water zone (BZ). \n\n \nSampling \n\nAll sampling took place during the warm season (early May to early September). Station \nN1 was studied over six different tidal cycles (two in June 1996, two in August 1996 and two in \n\n\n\n \nFactors influencing bacterial production \n\n \n\n 21\n\nN\n\nN1\n\nI6\n\nFigure 1: The estuarine ecosystem of the \nRia de Aveiro with sampling stations \nindicated by arrows. Station N1 in Canal \nde Navega\u00e7\u00e3o, represents the marine \nzone and station I6, in Canal de \u00cdlhavo, \nrepresents the brackish water zone. \n\nSeptember 1997). Station I6 was sampled over four tidal cycles (one in April and three in May \n1997). Samples were collected from near-water surface (0.2 m depth) and deep water (0.5 m above \nsediment floor), at high tide (HT) and low tide (LT) and intermediate time intervals of 2 hours \n\n(HT+2h, HT-2h, LT-2h, LT+2h). In the marine zone water \nsamples were also collected in 1996 at 2.5 and 4.5 m \nabove the bottom. Water samples were transported and \nprocessed within 2-3 hours of collection. \n\n \n \nPhysical, chemical and phytoplankton \n\ncharacteristics. Temperature and salinity were obtained \nwith a conductivity meter (WTW ? Wissenschaftlich \nTechnische Werkst\u00e4tten, Model LF 196). Dissolved \noxygen concentration, expressed as percentage of \nsaturation, was determined with a oxygen meter (WTW, \nModel OXI 96) equipped with a stirrer (WTW, Model BR \n190). The concentration of suspended solids was \ndetermined by filtration of triplicate 0.5 l water sample \naliquots through pre-weighed and pre-combusted \nWhatman GF/C filters. The filters were washed with 100 \nml of ultra-pure water, dried at 60\u00baC for 24 hours and \nsuspended solids calculated as the increase in dry weight. \nParticulate organic matter was determined as the loss of \nweight after 4 hours incineration at 525 \u00baC (29). \nParticulate organic carbon (POC) was calculated as 50% \nof the particulate organic matter (32). Samples for nutrient \nassay (PO4\n\n3-, NO3\n- + NO2\n\n-) were filtered through 0.45 \u00b5m \nacetate membranes (MSI - Micron Separation Inc.). \nPhosphate was determined by the molybdate method and \nNO2\n\n- plus NO3\n- by the sulfanilic acid method after \n\nreduction of NO3\n- to NO2\n\n- in a cadmium column. Analyses \nwere performed using a Segmented Flow Injection \nAutomatic Analyser Alliance Instruments \u2013 Evolution II \n(1). Chlorophyll a (CHLO) was estimated fluorimetrically \n(42) after filtration of 0.5 l triplicate sub-samples through \nWhatman GF/C filters and overnight cold extraction in \n90% (v/v) acetone. \n\n\n\n \nFactors influencing bacterial production \n\n \n\n22 \n\n \nTotal bacterial number (TBN). Bacterial cells were counted by epifluorescence \n\nmicroscopy using a Leitz Laborlux K microscope. The samples were fixed with 2% (v/v) \nformaldehyde (final concentration), filtered through 0.2 \u00b5m pore black polycarbonate membranes \n(Poretics) and stained with 0.03% (w/v) acridine orange (25). At least 200 cells or 20 microscope \nfields were counted in each of three replicate preparations. \n\n \nMicroautoradiography (MAR). Active bacterial numbers (ABN) were determined by \n\nmicroautoradiography (12) after amendment of samples to 30 nM 3H-leucine (Amersham, specific \nactivity 15.9-24.8 GBq mmol-1). After 5 hours incubation at in situ temperature, samples were fixed \nwith 2% (v/v) formaldehyde and triplicate sub-samples (2-3 ml) of each sample (10 ml) filtered \nthrough 0.2 \u00b5m black polycarbonate membranes. The filters were placed face down on slides \ncoated with the autoradiographic emulsion NTB-2 (Kodak) and exposed in total darkness, at 4\u00b0C, \nfor 7 days. The slides were developed with Kodak Detkol (one-to-one dilution in ultrapure water) \nand fixed in Kodak fixer. The developed autoradiograms were stained with acridine orange solution \n(0.04%) and hydrated in citrate buffer (0.004 M). Microautoradiographs were examined using a \ncombination of epifluorescence (as above) and bright-field illumination in a Leitz Laborlux \nmicroscope. Cells were counted as active if associated with three or more silver grains. \n\n \nBacterial biomass productivity (BBP) and specific biomass productivity (BBPcell and \n\nBBPactive cell). BBP was determined in 10-ml triplicate sub-samples plus a control that was fixed by \naddition of formaldehyde (2% final concentration). The samples were incubated at a saturating \nconcentration (30 nM) of 3H-leucine (Amersham, specific activity 15.9-24.8 GBq mmol-1) for 1 \nhour, at in situ temperature, in the dark. After incubation, sub-samples were fixed at 2% (v/v) \nformaldehyde. Protein precipitation was performed through the addition of 1 ml of 20% (w/v) ice-\ncold TCA followed by incubation for 15 minutes on ice. Sub-samples were then filtered through \n0.2 \u00b5m polycarbonate membranes (Poretics), rinsed with 2 ml of 5% (w/v) ice-cold TCA and 5 ml \nof 90% (v/v) ice-cold ethanol (8). After standing for 3 days in scintillation cocktail UniverSol (ICN \nBiomedicals, USA) the radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS \n6000 IC). BBP was calculated from leucine incorporation rates using a ratio of cellular carbon to \nprotein of 0.86 and a fraction of leucine in protein of 0.073 (36). BBPcell was calculated as the \nquotient BBP/TBN (BBPcell) and BBPactive cell was obtained from BBP/ABN. \n\n \nStatistical methods. SPSSWIN 7.1 was used for data analysis. As an attempt to explain \n\nthe variation of bacterial abundance and production, stepwise multiple regression analysis was \nused. Temperature, salinity, depth, POC and chlorophyll were used as independent variables. ABN \nand TBN were also included as independent variables for the regression analysis of BBP and ABN, \n\n\n\n \nFactors influencing bacterial production \n\n \n\n 23\n\nrespectively. The significance of difference between surface and bottom values in bacterial \nabundance, bacterial production and physico-chemical characteristics was assessed using one-way \nANOVA. Three sub-samples were used for each variable at the six tidal phases in different dates. \nOnly the data with normal distribution (assessed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) and with \nhomogeneity of variances (assessed by Levene test) were used. The significance of both depth and \ntide on bacterial production variation was assessed using two-way ANOVA. \n\n \n \n\nRESULTS \n \n\nPhysical, chemical and phytoplankton characteristics \nSalinity varied from 23.7 to 36.1 PSU (average 34.4 PSU) in the marine zone (MZ) and from 11.4 \nto 33.7 PSU (average 26.0 PSU) in the brackish water zone (BZ). The average water temperature \nwas 16.8\u00b0C (range 15.3 - 20.6 \u00b0C) in the MZ and 20.2 \u00b0C (range 17.0 - 23.5\u00b0 C) in the BZ.

The average numbers were \nthree times higher in the BZ than in the MZ. \nThe fraction of active bacteria (%AB) \nvaried from 5.9% to 55% and the average \nvalue was similar in both zones (26.6%) \n(Table 1). Bacterial biomass productivity \n(BBP) ranged from 0.05 to 4.5 \u00b5g C l-1 h-1 at \nstation N1 and from 0.7 to 14.2 \u00b5g C l-1 h-1 \nat I6.

Further data compared only surface (0.2 m) and \ndeep (0.5 m above the sediment) water layers. TBN and ABN were more abundant at the top of the \nwater column (Figure 3), but the difference between surface and deep water was not significant \n(ANOVA, p>0.05). The fraction of active bacteria was, however, similar at both depths (Table1). \nBacterial productivity was significantly higher (ANOVA, p<0.05) near the surface (Figure 4) being \non average 3.3 times greater than in deep water but reaching values up to 8.5 times greater. BBPcell \nand BBPactive cell were also higher near the surface, being on average 2.8 and 3.0 times greater than \nnear the bottom (Figure 5). The larger BBP registered in near-surface water was circumscribed to a \nmaximum depth of 0.5 m (Figure 1). The contribution of the surface water layer to the total BBP in \n\n\n\n \nFactors influencing bacterial production \n\n \n\n 25\n\nthe marine water column was 35%. The stratification of BBP, BBPcell and BBPactive cell was \nparticularly noticeable near low tide (Figures 4 and 5). No stratification of bacterial number, \nfraction of active bacteria or bacterial productivity was observed in the brackish water zone \n(Figures 6, 7, Table 1). The difference between surface and deep water was not significant \n(ANOVA, p>0.05). Specific productivity per cell was, however, frequently higher near surface \n\n(Figure 8) but the average was similar in surface and bottom water (Table 1). \nFigure 3: Total bacterial number (TBN) at 0.2 m below the surface and at 0.5 m above the sediment in the \nmarine zone (station N1) at high tide (HT), low tide (LT) and at intervals of 2 hours as indicated. ??? \nTBN at surface water, ---?--- TBN at deep water, ???

Although a first \napproach suggests that increased values of near-surface productivity could be associated with \nphytoplankton and bacterioplankton transport by surface water from the brackish water zone, other  \nbiological parameters (i. e. total and active bacterial numbers and chlorophyll concentration) were \nrelatively constant along the water column. Even though, the phytoplankton distribution could not \ndirectly explain the higher bacterial productivity in the half-meter surface water layer, irradiation \nmay enhance phytoplankton exudation (6, 19, 43) and consequently bacterial productivity in this \nwater layer. In addition, higher bacterial productivity in near-surface water could be stimulated by \nphotochemical transformation of recalcitrant dissolved organic matter into labile compounds that \nmay stimulate locally and transiently the growth of active bacteria. Although chemical analysis \nshowed that phosphate and nitrite plus nitrate levels were not significantly higher in near-surface \nwater, it has been found that photodegradation generates low molecular weight organic compounds \nsuch as primary amines (9) amino acids, combined amino acids and urea (26) that are readily \nassimilated by bacterioplankton. The higher stratification of bacterial production near low tide \nsuggests that part of the recalcitrant organic matter transformed by solar irradiation in the marine \nzone may be transported by tidal currents from the brackish water. It would be worthwhile to study \nvertical and longitudinal distribution of dissolved organic matter in the estuary and test the effects \nof irradiation on the degradation of recalcitrant DOM and on phytoplankton exudation. \n\n29 April 1997\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nHT HT+2 LT-2 LT LT+2 HT-2\n\nTidal phase\n\nB\nB\n\nP\nce\n\nll \n,  \n\nB\nB\n\nP\nac\n\ntiv\ne \n\nce\nll\n\n(f\ng \n\nC\n c\n\nel\nl h\n\n-1\n)\n\n6 May 1997\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nHT HT+2 LT-2 LT LT+2 HT-2\n\nTidal phase\n\nB\nB\n\nP\nce\n\nll \n, B\n\nB\nP\n\nac\ntiv\n\ne \nce\n\nll\n(f\n\ng \nC\n\n c\nel\n\nl h\n-1\n\n)\n\n22 May 1997\n\n9,6\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nHT HT+2 LT-2 LT LT+2 HT-2\n\nTidal phase\n\nB\nB\n\nP\nce\n\nll \n, B\n\nB\nP\n\nac\ntiv\n\ne \nce\n\nll\n(f\n\ng \nC\n\n c\nel\n\nl  \nh-\n\n1 )\n\n30 May 1997\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nHT HT+2 LT-2 LT LT+2 HT-2\n\nTidal phase\nB\n\nB\nP\n\nce\nll \n\n, B\nB\n\nP\nac\n\ntiv\ne \n\nce\nll\n\n(f\ng \n\nC\n c\n\nel\nl  \n\nh-\n1 )\n\n\n\n \nFactors influencing bacterial production \n\n \n\n 31\n\nTable IV: Multiple stepwise regression between LogABN and physico-chemical and biological variables. \nResults are present for data of the two zones (n = 118) and separately for marine zone (n = 70) and for \nbrackish water zone (n = 48). ?: standardized coefficient of regression; p: level of significance of the slopes \nin the regression equations.

Different spatial and temporal ranges \nwere observed in the values of bacterioplankton biomass (31-273 \u00b5g C l-1) and production (0.1-16.0 \u00b5g C l-1 \nh-1, 1.5-36.8 mg C m-2 h-1) as well as in phytoplankton abundance (50-1700 \u00b5g C l-1) and primary production \n(0.1-512.9 \u00b5g C l-1 h-1, 1.5-512.9 mg C m-2 h-1). Bacterial specific growth rate (0.10-1.68 d-1) during the year \ndid not fluctuate as much as phytoplankton specific growth rate (0.02-0.74 d-1). Along the salinity gradient \nand towards the inner estuary, bacterio- and phytoplankton biomass and production increased steadily both in \nthe warm and cold seasons. The maximum geographical increase observed in these variables was 12 times \nmore for the bacterial community and 8 times more for the phytoplankton community. The warm to cold \nseason ratios of the biological variables varied geographically and according to these variables. The increase \nat the warm season achieved its maximum in the biomass production, particularly in the marine zone and at \nhigh tide (20 and 112 times higher in bacterial and phytoplankton production, respectively). The seasonal \nvariation in specific growth rate was most noticeable in phytoplankton, with seasonal ratios of 3 to 26. The \nbacterial community of the marine zone responded positively - generating seasonal ratios of 1-13 in bacterial \nspecific growth rate - to the strong warm season increment in phytoplankton growth rate in this zone. In the \nbrackish water zone where even during the warm season allochthonous carbon accounted for 41 % (on \naverage) of the bacterial carbon demand, the seasonal ratio of bacterial specific growth rate varied from about \n1 to 2. During the warm season, an average of 21% of the primary production was potentially sufficient to \nsupport the whole bacterial production. During the cold months, however, the total primary production would \nbe either required or even insufficient to support bacterial production. The estuary turned then into a mostly \nheterotrophic system. However, the calculated annual production of biomass by bacterio- and phytoplankton \nin the whole ecosystem showed that auto- and heterotrophic production was balanced in this estuary. \n \nKey Words: Bacterial production, specific growth rate, primary production, estuary \n_______________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION \nThe functioning and, in particular, the productivity of estuarine ecosystems is largely \n\nreflected in the levels of primary production and in the fate of autochthonous and allochthonous \ncarbon. Changes in bacterial density and activity along trophic and salinity gradients affect \ndifferently the balance between carbon incorporation and carbon mineralisation in different parts of \nthe estuary (Carlson &amp; Ducklow, 1996; del Giorgio et al., 1997, del Giorgio &amp; Cole, 1998). In the \ncase of the mesotrophic ecosystem of Ria de Aveiro, most of the carbon which is uptaken by the \nwater column bacteria is incorporated into biomass (about 90% for glucose) (Cunha et al., 2000). \nThis is not the common conclusion derived from studies in other marine ecosystems where the \nbacterial growth efficiency in eutrophicated waters plateaux near 50% (reviewed by del Giorgio &amp; \nCole, 1998). \n\n\n\n \nSeasonal change in the proportion of bacterial and phytoplankton production \n \n\n36 \n\nN\n\nN1\n\nI6\n\nI8\n\nI2\n\nRB\n\nFigure 1: The estuarine system of Ria de \nAveiro. Sampling stations are indicated by \narrows along Canal de \u00cdlhavo. Station N1 in \nCanal de Navega\u00e7\u00e3o represents the marine \nzone of the ecosystem. Stations I2, I6 and I8 \nrepresent the brackish water section of the \nsalinity gradient along Canal de \u00cdlhavo. Rio \nBoco (RB) is a river station although it is \nmuch affected by the variable strength of the \ntidal current.\n\nIt is recognised that primary production plays a fundamental role on bacterial activity (Cole \net al., 1988; Conan et al., 1999; Ducklow &amp; Carlson, 1992) and that other factors, namely \n\nexogenous carbon (Cunha et al., 1999; Goosen et al. \n1997; Mann &amp; Wetzel, 1996; Reitner et al., 1999) may \naffect the coupling of these activities in aquatic \necosystems. On the other hand, physical and other \nchemical factors such as temperature, salinity and the \nconcentration of mineral nutrients (PO4\n\n3- and NO3\n-) are \n\nalso involved in the modulation of the \nbacterioplankton metabolism (Almeida et al., 2001a; \nCunha et al., 2000; Riegsbee et al., 1996; Shiah &amp; \nDucklow, 1994; Tabor &amp; Neihof, 1982). \n\nIt is also known that the heterotrophic \nbacterioplankton consumes a large, although variable, \nfraction of the primary production (up to 50%) in \nmarine and freshwater ecosystems (Cole et al., 1988; \nConan et al., 1999; Ducklow &amp; Carlson, 1992; Lignell, \n1990). The phytoplankton community, however, does \nnot always supply the total amount of carbon required \nfor the observed level of heterotrophic bacterial \ngrowth (Scavia &amp; Laird, 1987). In this case other \nsubstrate sources have to be admitted (Shiah &amp; \nDucklow, 1994). In this study we intended to evaluate \nthe importance of primary production in bacterial \ngrowth in a shallow estuary during the warm and cold \nseasons. \n\n \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n \n\nDescription of study site \nRia de Aveiro (see Fig. 1) is a mesotrophic \n\nshallow estuarine system on the western coast of \nPortugal connected to the Atlantic by a narrow \nopening. It is subjected to considerable inputs of \nindustrial and domestic discharges occurring mainly at \nthe periphery. \n\nThe lagoon covers an area of 66 to 83 Km2, \nrespectively at low and high tide (Silva, 1994). It \n\n\n\n \nSeasonal change in the proportion of bacterial and phytoplankton production \n\n \n\n 37\n\nexchanges with the sea 89 Mm3 of water in tides of 1 to 3 m amplitude (Silva, 1994). Several rivers \ncarry an average of 1.8 Mm3 of fresh water into the lagoon during a tidal cycle (Barrosa, 1985). The \nRia has a complex topography, with three channels spreading from the mouth towards the different \nstreams forming a multi-estuarine ecosystem. Secondary branches originate from the three main \nchannels to form a tight net of channels, islands and mudflats. In this study, we chose the Canal de \n\u00cdlhavo, the smallest of the second-order channels, with a water volume of 2.8 Mm3 at low tide and \n9.3 Mm3 at high tide. This channel offers the advantages of a straighter water circulation and the \nabsence of meaningful agriculture activity along the banks that might affect irregularly its trophic \ncondition. \n\nThe marine zone (MZ) of the ecosystem is represented by station N1 in Canal de \nNavega\u00e7\u00e3o. Stations I2, I6 and I8 represent the salinity gradient in the brackish water section (BZ). \nRio Boco (RB) is the river station that is periodically affected by the variable strength of the tidal \ncurrent. \n \nSampling. Water samples were collected along the longitudinal profile of salinity (see Fig. 1) in \nsummer of 1997 (12th and 20th July). In the cold season, samples were collected only at two \nsampling sites (station N1, 10th December 1997 and 9th January 1998; station I6, 28th October and \n7th November 1997). Surface water (0.2 m below surface) was collected at HT and LT at the centre \nof the channels. The diel variation in bacterial production was studied in the marine zone during the \nwarm season (16 and 17 of June 1997). In this case surface water samples were collected at \nintervals of 1 hour during a total of 24 hours. Water samples were transported to the laboratory and \nprocessed within 2-3 hours after collection. \n\n \nPhysical and chemical variables. Samples for nutrient (PO43-, NO3- + NO2-) analysis were filtered \nthrough MSI acetate membranes with a 0.45 \u00b5m pore size. PO4\n\n3- was determined by the molibdate \nmethod and NO2\n\n- plus NO3\n- were quantified by the sulfanilic acid method after reduction of NO3\n\n- to \nNO2\n\n- in a cadmium column. The analyses were performed in a Segmented Flow Injection \nAutomatic Analyser Alliance Instrument \u2013 Evolution II (Abreu &amp; Duarte, 1997). The concentration \nof suspended solids was determined after filtration of triplicate 0.5 l water aliquots through pre-\nweighted and pre-combusted Whatman GF/C filters. The filters were dried at 60\u00baC for 24 hours and \nsuspended solids (seston) calculated as the increase in dry weight. The organic matter fraction in \nthe seston (POM) was determined as the loss of weight after 4 hours combustion at 525 \u00baC (Parsons \net al., 1989). Particulate organic carbon (POC) was assumed to be 50% of POM (Rodier, 1996). \nThe depth of the water column was measured with a Sonar probe (Hondex PS-7 LCD Digital \nSounder). The turbidity of the water column was assessed as Secchi depth values (SD). \nTemperature and salinity values were read in a WTW LF 196 Conductivity Meter. Dissolved \n\n\n\n \nSeasonal change in the proportion of bacterial and phytoplankton production \n \n\n38 \n\noxygen concentration, expressed as percentage of saturation, was determined with a WTW OXI 96 \noxygen meter equipped with a WTW BR 190 stirrer. \n \nTotal Bacterial number (TBN) and bacterial biomass (BB). Bacterial cells were counted by \nepifluorescence microscopy with a Leitz Laborlux K microscope equipped with a I 2/3 filter for \nblue light. The samples were fixed with 2% formaldehyde (final concentration), filtered through \nblack polycarbonate membranes of 0.2 \u00b5m (Poretics) and stained with 0.03% acridine orange \n(Hobbie et al., 1977). At least 200 cells or 20 microscope fields were counted in each of three \nreplicate preparations. Bacterial biovolume was determined after measurement of 50 cells in each \nof triplicate samples. Cell volume was converted to cell carbon after assuming a conversion factor \nof 350 fg C \u00b5m-3 (Bjornsen, 1986). \n\n \nBacterial production (BP). Bacterial production was determined in 10 ml triplicate sub-samples \nplus a control that was immediately fixed by addition of formaldehyde (2% final concentration). \nThe samples were incubated in the presence of a saturating concentration (30 nM) of 3H-leucine \n(Amersham, specific activity of 58-92 Ci mmol-1). Incubation was carried out for 1 hour at in situ \ntemperature. After incubation, samples were fixed with formaldehyde. Protein precipitation was \nperformed through the addition of 1 ml 20% ice-cold TCA followed by 15 minutes incubation in \nice. These samples were filtered through 0.2 \u00b5m polycarbonate membranes (Poretics), rinsed twice \nwith 2 ml of 5% ice-cold TCA and 5 ml of 90% ice-cold ethanol (Blight et al., 1995). After \nstanding for 3 days in scintillation cocktail (Universol) the radioactivity was read in a liquid \nscintillation counter (Beckman LS 6000 IC). Bacterial production was calculated on a per litre \nbasis (\u00b5g C l-1 h-1) and integrated per square meter (mg C m-2 h-1) according to water depth. The \ntotal BP for the ecosystem during the cold or the warm season was calculated from the averaged \nBP at the two tides (HT, LT) expressed on a per litre basis. These values were multiplied by 24 \nhours not taking into account the eventual difference in production during night and day periods. \nThe semester production in each zone resulted from diel production multiplied by 183 days and the \naverage volume of water in the respective zone - 32.1 Mm3 in the MZ and 88.6 Mm3 in the BZ - \n(Silva, 1994). The annual BP in the lagoon resulted from the sum of the two semester values. \n \nBacterial specific growth rate (BGR). BGR was calculated as the ratio of bacterial production \n(BP), expressed in \u00b5g C l-1 h-1, and bacterial biomass (BB) expressed in \u00b5g C l-1. BGR per day \nrespected a 24 hour period. \n \nChlorophyll a (CHLO). The concentration of chlorophyll a was determined fluorimetrically \n(Yentsch &amp; Menzel, 1963) after filtration of 0.5 l triplicate samples through Whatman GF/C filters \n\n\n\n \nSeasonal change in the proportion of bacterial and phytoplankton production \n\n \n\n 39\n\nand overnight extraction in 90% acetone, at 4\u00b0C. Phytoplankton biomass was calculated from the \nconcentration of chlorophyll a assuming a conversion factor of 50 (Eppley et al., 1977). \n \nPrimary production (PP). Primary production was determined by the 14C-bicarbonate uptake \nmethod (Steeman-Nielsen, 1952). Duplicate samples (50 ml) were incubated with 8 \u00b5Ci 14C-\nbicarbonate (Amersham, specific activity of 50-60 mCi mmol-1) at simulated in situ light conditions \nadjusted with neutral light filters to 100%, 50%, 25%, 12,5%, 1% and 0,1% of incident light \nintensity. After 4 hours of incubation, 10 ml triplicate samples were filtered through a 0.2 \u00b5m pore-\nsize membranes (Poretics polycarbonate membranes). The filters were treated with fuming HCl for \n15 minutes and placed in picovials containing 5 ml of scintillation cocktail (Universol). The \nradioactivity was read immediately in a Beckman LS 6000 IC scintillation counter. Secchi depth \nwas used for the calculation of the depths corresponding to 50, 25, 10, 1 and 0.1% of incident light \nintensity. Secchi depth was multiplied by an empirical factor, 0.40, 0.81, 1.35, 2.70 and 5.40 \nrespectively for 50, 25, 10, 1 and 0.1% of incident light intensity (K. Gocke, pers. com.). The \nintegrated value, expressed in mg C m-2 h-1, was calculated taking into account the production and \nthe thickness of each photic layer. PP was then averaged according to the total volume of the water \ncolumn (\u00b5g C l-1 h-1). The total PP in the cold and warm seasons and the annual PP in the lagoon \nwas calculated as described above for bacterial production but taking into account 12 hour period \nof insulation. \n \nTable 1: Physical and chemical variables.

Specific growth rate per day \nwas calculated multiplying that ratio by the averaged period of insulation (12 hours). \n \n \nRESULTS \n \nPhysical and chemical variables \n\nA clear longitudinal gradient of salinity was observed between station N1, in the marine \nzone, (33.5-35.6 PSU) and Rio Boco (4.5-7.3 PSU) (as shown in Table 1). In winter the salinity \nvalues were 6-8 PSU lower when compared to summer values. Water temperature in the warm \nseason varied between 16.6 and 26.6 \u00b0C increasing upstream in daylight. In the cold season the \ntemperature declined to 11.2-18.5\u00b0C, not as much as usual for winter. The level of oxygen \nsaturation in the water column fluctuated from 76 to 116%. POC ranged from 5.5 to 7.0 mg l-1 in \nthe warm season, and from 6.7 to 9.5 mg l-1 in winter. The longitudinal profile of water depth \nvaried from 0.5 to 7.7 m during the warm season and from 1.8 to 13.0 m in the cold months. Secchi \ndepth was greater in the marine zone, ranging along the salinity gradient from 0.5 to 4.5 meters in \nthe warm season and from 0.8 to 2.0 meters in winter. The concentration of NO2\n\n- plus NO3\n- in the \n\nwarm season showed a longitudinal pattern of variation characterised by an enormous peak (111.6-\n204.6 \u00b5M) in the inner estuary. This peak did not reach the mid estuary and only a small variation \nin this concentration (0.9-5.5 \u00b5M) could be noticed from the mid-estuary to the mouth. The \nvariation in the concentration of PO4\n\n3- (0.3-3.3 \u00b5M) was not so clearly patterned, but the lowest \nconcentrations were always found at the outer estuary and the peaks at the mid-estuary (as shown \nin Table 1). The nutrients levels were usually higher at low tide throughout the longitudinal profile \nproducing LT/HT ratios of 2.3 for NO2\n\n- plus NO3\n- and 4.4 for PO4\n\n3-. In winter, the nutrient levels in \nRia de Aveiro, are usually up to 20 times higher for NO2\n\n- plus NO3\n- and up to 2 times higher for \n\nPO4\n3- (T. Vinhas, M Valen\u00e7a, unpublished data). \n\n \nTable 2: Warm to cold season ratios of bacterioplankton and phytoplankton variables measured at HT and LT \nin the marine (MZ) and brackish water zones (BZ).

In the cold \n\nseason, BB decreased, in general, by a factor of 2 (as shown in Table 2). BB was higher at low tide \n(LT) in the marine and brackish water zones and in both seasons. Phytoplankton biomass (PB) \nshowed also a clear longitudinal pattern of variation with a maximum value of 1675 \u00b5g C l-1 at \nstation I8, in summer and at high tide (HT). In the cold months the levels of phytoplankton biomass \ndecreased 8.5 times at station N1 and 2.5 at station I6 (as shown in Table 2). At station I6, in the \nbrackish water zone, phytoplankton biomass was higher at LT (1.5 x) in opposition to station N1, \nin the marine zone, where phytoplankton was 1.8 times more concentrated at HT. Bacterial \nproduction (BP) was more intense in the brackish water stations of the lagoon. In the warm season \nBP ranged from 1.1 to 16.0 \u00b5g C l-1 h-1 (6.3 to 36.8 mg C m-2 h-1) along the longitudinal profile  \n(see Fig. 3). In a 24 hour tidal cycle in the marine zone during the warm season, BP decreased to \naround 50% during the dark period when compared to the diel average (see Fig. 4). At noon, BP \nwas around twice the diel average while at mid-night, in the same tidal phase, BP was 1.6 times \nlower than the diel average and 2.7 times lower than the noon value. In winter, BP values (0.1 to \n6.0 \u00b5g C l-1 h-1 or 1.5 to 17.7 mg C m-2 h-1) decreased 2 times at LT and 20 times at HT in the outer \nestuary (station N1) and within a range of 2-3 times in the mid estuary (station I6) as shown in \n\n\n\n \nSeasonal change in the proportion of bacterial and phytoplankton production \n \n\n42 \n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14\n\n    Hour\n 16 Jun                                                               17 Jun\n\nB\nP\n\n (\u00b5\ng \n\nC\n l-\n\n1  h\n-1\n\n), \nC\n\nhl\nor\n\n (\u00b5\ng \n\nl-1\n)\n\n26\n\n28\n\n30\n\n32\n\n34\n\n36\n\nS\nal\n\nin\nity\n\n (p\nsu\n\n)\n\nBP CHLO Sal\n\nFigure 4: Diel fluctuation of bacterial production (BP) and \nchlorophyll a (CHLOR) in response to tidal current in the \nmarine zone (warm season).

However, the pattern of BP variation with tide was not very clear in any of the two \nstations. \n\nPhytoplankton production (PP) in summer varied along the longitudinal profile from 13.6 \nto 512.9 \u00b5g C l-1 h-1 (60.1 to 512.9 mg C m-2.h-1) increasing from the outer to the inner estuary (see \nFig. 3). The sharpness of the increasing profile was attenuated when PP was integrated according to \nwater column depth. In fact, although phytoplankton activity was lower in the MZ, the greater \nwater depth of this zone  increased the integrated value. In the cold season, PP varied from 0.11 to \n3.3 \u00b5g C l-1 h-1 (1.5 to 6.0 mg C m-2.h-1). Compared to summer values it decreased 35-112 times at \nstation N1 and 9-21 at station I6 (as shown in Table 2).

In the marine zone, BGR at HT \nwas 13 times lower in cold water than in summer. At LT BGR was similar in both seasons. In the \nbrackish water zone, BGR at HT was similar in the warm and cold weather but at LT was about 2 \ntimes higher in warm water. Phytoplankton specific growth rate ranged from 0.32 to 0.74 d-1 in the \nwarm season and from 0.02 to 0.12 d-1 in winter (see Fig. 5). In summer PGR could increase up to \n26 times at HT in the marine zone. PGR maxima were observed at HT and coincided with PP \nmaxima in both seasons. \n\nIn the warm season, BP/PP varied from 0.02 to 0.35 along the longitudinal profile of Canal \nde \u00cdlhavo (see Fig. 6) with maxima at LT. The proportion of bacterioplankton biomass to \nphytoplankton biomass (BB/PB) in this season ranged from 0.13 to 0.30. Both ratios tended to \nincrease from the outer- to the mid-inner estuary. In the cold season, however, BP/PP and BB/PB \nratios increased to values of 1.00 to 3.61 and 0.34 to 0.91, respectively (see Fig. 6). \n\n \n\nDISCUSSION \nDifferent seasonal, geographical and tidal conditions, involving temperature, salinity and \n\nnutrient supply, originated a wide range of bacterioplankton specific growth rates (0.14 \u2013 1.68 d-1). \nWarm weather enhanced the specific bacterial growth rate by factors of up to 2 in brackish water \n\n\n\n \nSeasonal change in the proportion of bacterial and phytoplankton production \n \n\n44 \n\nand of up to 13 in marine water. The factor of increase in BGR fluctuated considerably during the \ntidal cycle. Previous laboratory experiments have demonstrated the strong response of bacterial \nactivity to exposure to contrasting water properties (Cunha et al., 2001). Taking these results into \nconsideration, the tidal fluctuation of BGR was interpreted as the result of poor growth of brackish \nwater bacteria when transported to a high salinity environment as well as of the stimulation of \nmarine water bacteria when transported to brackish water. The positive response of marine bacteria \nto brackish water is, however, counterbalanced to some extent by the low salinity. Preliminary \nresults showed that the stimulation could be enhanced if salinity of brackish water was increased by \nthe addition of NaCl (M. A. Almeida, M. A. Cunha, F. Alc\u00e2ntara, accepted for publication). These \nfacts resulted in an absence of a significant increase of BGR at LT in the marine zone as well as at \nHT in the brackish water zone during the warm season as might be expected. For this reason, the \ngeneral increase in BGR from the mouth to the mid-inner estuary was clearer at LT. These facts \ntaken together help to explain the observed spatial variation in bacterial production and reinforce \nour prior conclusion on the existence of bacterial communities with distinct salinity optima in the \nestuary (M. A. Almeida, M. A. Cunha, F. Alc\u00e2ntara, accepted for publication). The seasonal and \ngeographical variation of phytoplankton specific growth rate followed the same pattern as BGR but \nwas affected by higher factors. Phytoplankton growth rate in the cold season decreased by factor of \n3 to 26, probably due more to reduction of insulation than the small decrease in temperature, \nwhereas BGR decreased by factors of 1-13. The greater (2-4 times) PGR values observed in the \nbrackish water zone followed the increase in nutrients concentrations. \n\nIn the cold months and throughout the longitudinal profile of salinity, the bacterio- to \nphytoplankton biomass ratio was considerably high (0.34-0.91) suggesting that primary production \nmay not be enough to support secondary production. Indeed, the production ratio (BP/PP) along the \nsalinity gradient varied, during this season, from 1.00 to 3.61. We infer that in the cold season, the \npotential contribution of allochthonous carbon to bacterial biomass production was very high (close \nto 100%) in both zones of the lagoon. \n\nIn the warm season, the scenery in the lagoon changed. The bacterio- to phytoplankton \nbiomass ratio along the longitudinal profile of salinity decreased to much less than 1 (0.13 to 0.30) \nboth at HT and LT. These ratios suggest that bacterial production, in the warm season, might be \nessentially supported by phytoplankton carbon. In fact, the results showed that BP/PP ranged from \n0.02 to 0.35. The carbon incorporated in bacterial biomass at the different sampling stations \ncorresponded, on average, to about 21% of primary production, an acceptable value as observed in \nother environments where phytoplankton could support the whole bacterial production (Cole et al., \n1988; Fuks et al., 1994; Kuosa &amp; Kivi, 1989; Lignell, 1990). Assuming that the contribution of \nprimary production to bacterial production in winter is negligible, that the sources of allochthonous \ncarbon are seasonally stable and that the water temperature did not vary drastically from one season \nto the other, the bacterial production in winter could be taken as a measure of allochthonous carbon \n\n\n\n \nSeasonal change in the proportion of bacterial and phytoplankton production \n\n \n\n 45\n\ninputs and used to more accurately estimate the contribution of phytoplankton to bacterial \nproduction in warm weather. The fraction of primary production diverted to the bacterial biomass \nproduction in the warm season (BPsummer\u2013BPwinter/PPsummer) would decrease to 13%. These figures \nare within the range of the estimated 6-16% by Conan et al. (1999) for aquatic systems in general \nand of the experimental estimated 5-15% obtained by Fernandez et al. (1994) in the Mediterranean \nSea. Neither is it far from the 20% value reported by Rheinheimer (1981) for the Kiel Bight. \nFurthermore, the observation of diel fluctuation in bacterial productivity, characterised by a \ndecreased average during the dark period, suggests coupling between phytoplankton production \nand consumption by bacteria as reported by Gasol et al. (1998). Although during the warm season \nprimary production could be enough to support the whole bacterial production in the estuary, in the \nbrackish water zone allochthonous carbon could contribute, nevertheless, to the production of a \nsignificant fraction of bacterial biomass. Taking into consideration the previous estimate of \nallochthonous organic carbon inputs it is possible to estimate the contribution of primary \nproduction to bacterial production during the warm season by subtracting the fraction sustained by \nallochthonous sources from the total bacterial production in summer. The fraction of bacterial \nproduction sustained by primary production was estimated in this way as 59% of the total bacterial \nproduction in the brackish water zone and as 74% in the marine zone. This confirms the results of \nother authors who found that in mid-inner estuary the coupling between BP and PP was lower than \nin the outer estuary (Shiah &amp; Duklow, 1995). \n\n \nCONCLUSION \n\nThe specific growth rate of the bacterioplankton within the estuary was patterned according \nto space and season along the estuarine gradient. The presence of bacterial communities with \ndistinct salinity optima, adapted to marine or brackish water conditions, seemed to affect the \npattern at different tides. \n\nThe geographical, seasonal and diel variations in biomass production bring about the \nconclusion that on an annual basis and on a per water volume unit, the ratio bacterial production to \nprimary production was less than 1 in the marine zone and almost 1 in the brackish water zone. \nThis defines two broad subsystems where bacterioplankton and phytoplankton are in different \nbalance in relation to biomass production. \n\n \nREFERENCES \n\u2022 Abreu, S. &amp; A.

In \nfield conditions, it was observed that total and active bacterial numbers were, on average, 3 times higher in \nbrackish water than in marine water. The fraction of active bacteria was, however, similar in both zones \n(26.6% on average). Total leucine incorporation, as a measure of biomass productivity, was 3.5 times higher \nin the brackish water zone following the increase in bacterial population size. Productivity seemed also to \ndepend on the level of activity of individual cells since specific leucine incorporation per active cell was 19% \nhigher in the brackish water zone. Experimental assays in diffusion chambers showed that when the marine \nbacterial community was exposed for 6 hours to brackish water, the fraction of active bacteria and leucine \nincorporation increased (20 to 60% and 50 to 220%, respectively). The opposite was observed when the \nbrackish water community was exposed to marine water (20% decrease in the fraction of active bacteria and \n50 to 80% in leucine incorporation). The positive response of marine bacteria to the brackish water \nconditions was higher when the salinity of the brackish water was artificially increased to 34 psu. Brackish \nwater bacteria, however, responded negatively to this increase in salinity. When the marine community was \nexposed for only 2 h to brackish water it promptly showed increased activity. The immediate transfer of this \ncommunity to marine water for an extra 4 h period induced a return to the initial low activity level. In \ncontrast, the negative response of the brackish water community after 2 h of exposure to marine water was \nirreversible when transferred back to brackish water. Bacteria remained at a low activity level for the extra 4 \nhours. The high bacterial abundance and production in mid-estuary and the similar patterns of variation of \ntotal and active bacteria throughout the system, seemed to indicate conservative transport of an euryhaline \nbacterial community from its main source in the mid estuary. However, the experimental assays with \ndiffusion chambers invalidated this hypothesis. They suggest the presence of 2 communities: a nutrient-\nlimited marine zone community that grows optimally at high salinity, and a nutrient-replete brackish water \ncommunity requiring salinities bellow 25 psu. \n \nKey Words: Active bacteria, Leucine incorporation, Bacterial stimulation, Estuary \n_______________________________________________________________________________________ \n \nINTRODUCTION \n\nBacterioplankton communities in estuarine systems are frequently exposed to varying \nenvironmental conditions. The mixing of seawater and freshwater, the different residence time, the \ntransportation of materials from diverse sources, including salt marshes, mudflats, rivers and \nbottom sediments and different climatic conditions, may induce different patterns of bacterial \nabundance and activity in different estuaries. Estuarine gradients of bacterial abundance are \ngenerally characterised by a steady increase in density (factors up to 3) from the outer- to the \nupper-estuary (Palumbo &amp; Fergunson 1978, Goosen et al. 1997) or to the mid-estuary (Wright &amp; \nCoffin 1983, Bordalo et al. 1998, Cunha et al. 2000). Although the metabolically active cells in \nthese populations correspond generally to a small fraction, rarely reaching 50 % (Rodriguez et al. \n1992, Button et al. 1993, del Giorgio &amp; Scarborough 1995, Zweifel &amp; Hagstrom 1995, Ullrich et \nal. 1996, Sherr et al. 1999, Choi et al. 1999), the shifts in water characteristics have been reported \n\n\n\n \nPhysiological responses of marine and brackish water bacterial assemblages \n\n \n\n 50 \n\nto induce stronger responses in the size of the fraction of active bacteria than in the total bacterial \nnumber (del Giorgio &amp; Scarborough 1995). The relative size of this fraction is minimal in \noligotrophic ocean water (<5%) and increases towards the estuaries up to 50% (Rodriguez et al. \n1992, Button et al. 1993, Gasol et al. 1995, del Giorgio &amp; Scarborough 1995). The reasons \nunderlying this variation are not well understood. Substrate availability has been extensively \nstudied as a potentially important factor controlling cell activity. A number of studies showed \npositive correlation between the number of active bacteria and the concentration of inorganic \nnutrients and of dissolved organic carbon in highly productive lakes and estuaries (del Giorgio &amp; \nScarborough 1995). The systematic differences in the percentage of active cells in systems with \ncomparable trophic conditions suggest at other factors combine to control bacterial activity (del \nGiorgio &amp; Scarborough 1995). Temperature (Quinn 1984, Wright &amp; Coffin 1984, Tabor &amp; Neihof \n1984, Shiah &amp; Ducklow 1994), salinity (Rigsbee et al. 1996), viral infection (Proctor &amp; Fuhrman \n1990) and bacterial predation (Gonzalez et al. 1990, Sherr et al. 1992, Bird &amp; Kalf 1993, Cole &amp; \nCaraco 1993) may interact and produce different final results. \n\nBacterial responses to changing water properties are generally higher in terms of activity \nrates than in terms of abundance (del Giorgio et al. 1996). Leucine incorporation, different \nenzymatic activities and glucose turnover, although maximal in the mid-estuary, may show, \nhowever, different environmental reactivities (Cunha et al. 2000). These differences in metabolic \nproperties along the estuarine gradients may be related to the spatial distribution of distinct \nbacterial communities. In fact, Bidle &amp; Fletcher (1995) have already found, in Chesapeake Bay, \ngenetic differences in free-living bacteria populations from the upper- and mid- bay regions. \nMurray et al. (1996) analysed the phylogenetic diversity of bacterial assemblages in two California \nestuaries and concluded that bacterial similarity in adjacent stations was greater than in distant \nstations. These differences in genetic similarity may, according to the authors, be interpreted to \nresult from the mixing of different communities or to the influence of the organic matter gradient in \nthe physiology of the same microbial assemblage. \n\n \nPrevious studies on the dynamics of bacterioplankton in the lagunar system of Ria de \n\nAveiro found a curvilinear profile of bacterial abundance and bacterial activities with peaks at the \n20-30 psu section of the estuary (Almeida et al. in press, Cunha et al. 2000). Nutrients, organic \nmatter and phytoplankton biomass concentrations were maximal in the mid- upper- estuary (Cunha \net al. 1999, 2000, in press). In this study we attempt to distinguish 2 hypotheses in experimental \nconditions: the patterned gradient of bacterial activity results from flexible physiological responses \nof a single bacterial community to a changing environment or either from different reactivities of \nbacterial communities with distinct activity profiles. \n \n \n\n\n\n \nPhysiological responses of marine and brackish water bacterial assemblages \n\n \n\n 51\n\nN\n\nN1\n\nI6\n\nFigure 1:Ria de Aveiro with sampling \nstations indicated by the arrows. \nStation N1 in Canal de Navega\u00e7\u00e3o, \nrepresenting the marine zone and \nstation I6, in Canal de \u00cdlhavo, \nrepresenting the brackish water zone. \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n \nStudy site \n\nRia de Aveiro (Figure 1) is a tidal lagoon on the western coast of Portugal, which is \nconnected to the Atlantic Ocean by a narrow opening. The \nlagoon covers an area of 66 to 83 km2 at low (LT) and \nhigh tide (HT), respectively (Silva, 1994). It exchanges \nwith the sea 89 millions of cubic meters of water over \ntides amplitude ranging from 1 to 3 m (Silva 1994). \nSeveral rivers carry fresh water into the lagoon with an \naverage water input of 1.8 millions of cubic meters during \na tidal cycle (Barrosa, 1985). The Ria has a complex \ntopography, with different channels spreading from the \nmouth towards the different streams forming, in fact, a \nmulti-estuarine ecosystem. Secondary branches originate \nfrom the 3 main channels forming a tight network of \nsmaller channels, islands and mudflats. For this study, two \nsampling stations were selected to represent contrasting \nwater characteristics: Station N1 in Canal de Navega\u00e7\u00e3o, \nrepresenting the marine zone, and station I6 in Canal de \n\u00cdlhavo, representing the brackish water zone. \n\n \n \n\nSampling \nThe marine zone of the Ria was studied during 6 \n\ndifferent tidal cycles (1 and 3 June 1996, 28 and 30 \nAugust 1996, 2 and 10 September 1997), 5 of them in \nspring tide and 1 in neap tide. The brackish water zone \nwas sampled during 4 tidal cycles (29 April and 5, 22 and \n30 May 1997), 2 in spring tide and 2 in neap tide. Samples \nwere collected at surface (0.2 m from the surface) and \ndeep water (0.5 m above sediment floor) at HT and LT \nand at intervals of 2 h (HT-2h, HT+2h, LT-2h, LT+2h). \nWater samples were transported and processed within 2-3 \nh after collection. \n\nSamples for experimental assays were collected at \nthe same 2 zones. For better contrast of the environmental \n\n\n\n \nPhysiological responses of marine and brackish water bacterial assemblages \n\n \n\n 52 \n\nconditions at the 2 zones, station N1 was sampled at flood tide, 2 h before HT, and station I6 at ebb \ntide, 2 hours before LT. Water samples collected during the flood tide in the marine zone \nrepresented marine environmental conditions and the corresponding bacterial community. Samples \ncollected during ebb tide at station I6 represented the characteristics and the bacterial community of \nthe brackish water zone of the estuary. For assays in diffusion chambers, surface water was \nsampled in February and June 1998 and in November 1999. For studying the response of bacteria \nto the amendment of nutrient several surface samples were collected at the 2 stations from January \n1998 to November 1999. \n\n \nPhysical and chemical characteristics. Temperature and salinity were read in a \n\nconductivity meter (millions of cubic meters, WTW ? Wissenschaftlich Technische Werkst\u00e4tten). \nDissolved oxygen concentration, expressed as percentage of saturation, was determined with an \noxygen meter (Model OXI 96, WTW ? Wissenschaftlich Technische Werkst\u00e4tten) equipped with \na stirrer (Model BR 190, WTW ? Wissenschaftlich Technische Werkst\u00e4tten). The concentration \nof suspended solids was determined after filtration of triplicate 0.5 l water aliquots through pre-\nweighted and pre-combusted Whatman GF/C filters. The filters were dried at 60\u00baC for 24 hours and \nsuspended solids (seston) were calculated as the increase in dry weight. The organic matter fraction \nin the seston was determined as the loss of weight after 4 hours combustion at 525 \u00baC (Parsons et \nal. 1989). \n\n \nTotal bacterial number. Bacterial cells were counted by epifluorescence microscopy with \n\na Leitz Laborlux K microscope equipped with a I 2/3 filter for blue light. The samples were fixed \nwith 2% formaldehyde (final concentration), filtered through black polycarbonate membranes of \n0.2 \u00b5m (Poretics) and stained with 0.03% acridine orange (Hobbie et al. 1977). At least 200 cells or \n20 microscope fields were counted in each of 3 replicate preparations.  \n\n \nActive bacterial number \nMicroautoradiography. The number of active bacteria was determined by \n\nmicroautoradiography (Carman, 1993) after amendment with a 30 nM 3H-leucine solution \n(Amersham specific activity of 58-92 Ci mmol-1). After 5 hours incubation at in situ temperature, \ntriplicate sub-samples (2-3 ml) of each 10 ml sample were filtered through black polycarbonate \nmembranes. The filters were placed face down on slides coated with the autoradiographic emulsion \nNTB-2 (Kodak). The exposure, in total darkness and at 4\u00b0C, was carried out for 7 days. The slides \nwere developed with Kodak Detkol (1:1 dilution in ultrapure water) and fixed in Kodak fixer. The \ndeveloped autoradiograms were stained with acridine orange solution (0.04%) and hydrated in \ncitrate buffer (0.004 M). Microautoradiographs were examined using a combination of \n\n\n\n \nPhysiological responses of marine and brackish water bacterial assemblages \n\n \n\n 53\n\nepifluorescence (as above) and bright-field illumination (in a Leitz Laborlux microscope). Cells \nwere counted as active if associated with 3 or more silver grains. \n\n \nCTC reduction. Five millilitre triplicate water sub-samples were placed in sterile plastic \n\ntubes and supplemented with freshly prepared 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyltetrazolium chloride (CTC) \nsolution to a final concentration of 5 mM (Ullrich et al. 1996). A fixed control was prepared by \nfirst adding filtered formaldehyde (2% final concentration) to an otherwise similarly prepared water \nsample, which, after 30 min, was further supplied with the CTC solution. Controls and test samples \nwere incubated in the dark for 4 hours at room temperature with slow agitation (100 rpm). Samples \nwere filtered through 0.2 \u00b5m black polycarbonate membranes (Poretics) and observed for red \nfluorescence. At least 200 CTC positive cells, or 20 microscope fields, were enumerated in each of \nthe 3 replicate samples. \n\n \nLeucine incorporation. Leucine incorporation was determined in 10-ml triplicate sub-\n\nsamples plus a control that was fixed by the addition of formaldehyde (2% final concentration). \nThe samples were incubated at a saturating concentration (30 nM) of 3H-leucine (Amersham, \nspecific activity of 58 to 92 Ci mmol-1) for 1 h at in situ temperature. Sub-samples were fixed in \n2% formaldehyde. Protein was precipitate through the addition of 1 ml of 20% ice-cold TCA, \nfollowed by incubation for 15 min in ice. Sub-samples were filtered through 0.2 \u00b5m polycarbonate \nmembranes (Poretics), and rinsed with 2 ml of 5% ice-cold TCA and 5 ml of 90% ice-cold ethanol \n(Blight et al. 1995). After 3 days of being in scintillation cocktail (Universol) the radioactivity was \nread in a liquid scintillation counter (LS 6000 IC, Beckman). Leucine incorporation was calculated \nusing a ratio of cellular carbon to protein of 0.86 and a fraction of leucine in protein of 0.073 \n(Simon &amp; Azam, 1989). Cell-specific leucine incorporation was calculated as the quotient between \nleucine incorporation and the total bacterial number, whereas leucine incorporation per active cell \nwas the ratio between leucine incorporation and the active bacterial number. \n\n \nBacterial activity in diffusion chambers assays. These assays were devised to measure \n\nrapid (up to 6 h) responses of the bacterial community of a tidal estuarine environment to the \nconditions prevailing in different phases of the tidal cycles. The idea behind this was to expose the \nsame population to changing environmental conditions. Two experimental incubation systems were \nprepared, each consisting of a stirred, temperature controlled, water bath filled with 15 l of water, \neither from station N1 (representing the marine zone) or from station I6 (representing the brackish \nwater zone). Diffusion chambers with a capacity 170 ml were prepared as described by Pereira &amp; \nAlc\u00e2ntara (1993). Two 12.5 cm diameter of 0.2 \u00b5m pore size polycarbonate membranes formed the \nsides of each chamber, and allowed ample percolation of water and dissolved substances. One set \nof 7 diffusion chambers was filled with water from the marine zone and another set with water \n\n\n\n \nPhysiological responses of marine and brackish water bacterial assemblages \n\n \n\n 54 \n\nfrom the brackish zone. Four chambers from each set were incubated in the bath filled with the \nsame type of water (1 blank and 3 controls) and the other 3 in the contrasting bath (test chambers). \nThe closed chambers were incubated completely immersed in the water bath at 20\u00b0C for 6 hours, \ncorresponding approximately to the duration of half of a tidal cycle. Samples were taken after 2, 4 \nand 6 h of incubation without removing the chambers from the bath. Each time a volume of 40 ml \nof water was collected through an opening at the top of the chamber. Dilution due to permeation \nafter sampling (entrance of water due to the reduction of pressure inside the chambers) was taken \ninto account and corrected using the blank chambers, which were also sampled after 2, 4 and 6 h. \nIn the blank chambers the remaining volume of water was always measured and again inserted into \nthe chamber. At the end of the exposure period, the volume of water inside the test, control and \nblank chambers was also measured. The initial characteristics of the marine and brackish water \nsamples were determined immediately after field sampling. \n\n \n \n\nTable 1: Combinations of supplements added to marine and brackish waters. * Arginine, histhidine, \nisoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, valine (Sigma LAA-10);** \nThiamine (B1), Riboflavine (B2), Pyridoxine (B6), vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, inositol, choline, biotin and \nfolic acid.

The active bacterial numbers were determinated in February and June 1998 \nby the microautoradiography method, while in November 1999 the CTC reduction method was \nused. The values obtained for total bacterial number, active bacterial number and leucine \nincorporation were multiplied by the inverse of the factor of dilution determined in the blank \nchamber. \n\n \nBacterial activity after supplement amendment. Surface water samples were \n\ncomplemented with different combinations of inorganic and organic substrates to induce recovery \nfrom occasional dormancy in the bacterial communities. Marine and brackish water samples were \nseparately enriched with different substrates as described in table 1. \n\nTo avoid significant dilution of the samples, 10 to 100 times concentrated substrate \nsolutions were used. Samples for active cells counting were taken 10 min after substrate addition, \nexcept in November 1999, when the pre-stimulation period was extended to 1, 2 or 3 h. Active \nbacterial numbers were determined using the CTC technique (see above). It is assumed that during \nthe short incubation period the total number of bacterial cells did not increase significantly. To \navoid interference of CTC fluorescence in total bacterial counts, parallel sub-samples were \nincubated, after the supplement addition but without CTC, for determination of total counts. \n \n\n \n\nRESULTS \n \nPhysical, chemical and biological properties of marine and estuarine water \n\nDuring the tidal cycle, the salinity varied from 23.7 to 36.1 psu (average 34.4 psu) in the \nmarine zone and from 11.4 to 33.7 psu (average 26.0 psu) in the brackish water zone. The average \nwater temperature was 16.8\u00b0C (range 15.3 to 20.6 \u00b0C) in the marine zone and 20.2 \u00b0C (range 17.0 \nto 23.5\u00b0 C) in the brackish water zone. Oxygen concentration was usually below saturation in both \nzones. The mean value was 76.7 % in the marine zone and 69.8 % in the brackish water zone. \nParticulate organic matter varied from 6.0 to 31.0 mg l-1 (average 14.4) in the marine zone and \n\n\n\n \nPhysiological responses of marine and brackish water bacterial assemblages \n\n \n\n 56 \n\nfrom 6.0 to 17.0 mg l-1 (average 11.0) in the brackish water zone.

The active bacteria number (determined by microautoradiography) varied \nfrom 0.9 x 108 to 31.0 x 108 cells l-1 (Table 2). Bacterial abundance (total and active) was, on \naverage, 3 times higher in the brackish water zone than in the marine zone. In both zones the \nhighest values of total and active bacteria were observed near LT (Fig. 2). Although total and active \nbacterial densities were frequently higher at the surface in the marine zone, the values were not \nsignificantly different from those observed near the bottom. In the shallower brackish water zone, \nthe values were rather similar throughout the water column.

In the marine zone, leucine incorporation was higher at surface water, reaching values \nof up to 8.5 times higher than that near-bottom water. In the brackish water zone the leucine \nincorporation did not vary along the water column (Fig. 3).

For this \nreason, it may be \nexpected that in this \nestuary section not \nonly would the \nnumber of active \n\nbacteria be greater than in any other region of the salinity gradient but also their proportion in the \ntotal bacterial community would increase. The percentages of active bacteria in marine and \nbrackish water were, however, very close (average 27.9 % in the marine zone and 25.1 % in the \nbrackish water zone) in similar sampling occasions although they could vary within a considerable \nrange (6 to 55 % in the marine zone; 8 to 44 % in brackish water). This variation was erratic, with \nno relation to tidal water circulation. The constancy in the fraction of the active bacteria may be \ninterpreted as denoting the conservative transport of bacterial cells along the estuarine salinity \ngradient. The alteration in the average level of activity per active cell (19% increase in brackish \nwater) would be explained by the observed nutrient gradient. This hypothesis of conservative \ntransport is weakened by the relatively long residence time of freshwater in the mid-estuary (10 to \n97 days) and in the outer-estuary (1 to 45 days) (Silva 1994). \n\nThe long exposure of the bacterial community during transport to a less favourable \nenvironment than upstream may interfere with the spatial patterns of abundance and activity. When \nresidence time is long, distinct bacterial assemblages may occur in different zones of the estuary. \n\nA B\n\nBA\n\n\n\n \nPhysiological responses of marine and brackish water bacterial assemblages \n\n \n\n 63\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n0 2 4 6\nHours of exposure\n\nLI\n (\u00b5\n\ng \nC\n\n l-\n1  \n\nh-\n1 )\n\n25\n\n75\n\n125\n\n175\n\n225\n\n275\n\n325\n\n0 2 4 6\nHours of exposure\n\n%\n o\n\nf t\nhe\n\n c\non\n\ntr\nol\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n0 2 4 6Hours of exposure\n\n%\n o\n\nf t\nhe\n\n c\non\n\ntr\nol\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n0 2 4 6\nHours of exposure\n\n%\nA\n\nB\n\nFig. 8: (A) Variation in the fraction of active bacteria (%AB) and in leucine \nincorporation (LI) during 6 h of exposure of marine and brackish water \nbacterial communities to brackish water with natural salinity (18 PSU) or \nwith increased salinity (34 psu).

November 1999. ---?--\nmarine water in brackish water with natural salinity (18 psu), ---?---\nbrackish water in brackish water with natural  salinity (18 psu), ???\nmarine water in brackish water with increased salinity (34 psu), ???\nbrackish water in brackish water with increased salinity (34 psu). \n\nTo clarify these two interpretations and in order to evaluate the importance of the salinity \ngradient in the eventual differentiation of estuarine bacterial communities, we looked for \n\nexperimental evidence \nin diffusion chambers \nexperiments. When the \nmarine and brackish \nwater communities \nwere exposed to \nreciprocally exchanged \nwater they responded \npromptly (&lt;6 h) and \ninversely to the new \nenvironment. Leucine \nincorporation and the \n\nfraction of active \nbacteria increased in \nthe marine community \nincubated in brackish \nwater. On the contrary, \nthe brackish water \ncommunity challenged \n\nwith marine water responded negatively reducing leucine incorporation and the fraction of active \nbacteria. Again, this may be associated solely with the higher concentrations of organic carbon and \nnutrients in the microcosms exposed to brackish water. It is underlined that the decrease in salinity \n(from 32 to 16 psu, on average) did not preclude the positive response of the marine community to \nbrackish water although the artificial increase of the brackish water salinity to 34 psu produced a \nmore intense reaction in the marine bacteria. \n\nThe attempted discrimination between several simple and complex substrates that could be \nmore or less involved in the promotion of bacterial activity in the conditions of this estuary was not \nsuccessful. The size of the active community was insensitive to 3 h exposure to any of the chosen \nsubstrates. These results, confronted with the positive reactions obtained with natural water in \ndiffusion chambers, may indicate that a combination of factors may be required to induce bacterial \nactivation. The awakening cell activity after experimental stimulation may not, however, be \ndetectable through CTC-reduction due to the toxicity of the chemical (Davey &amp; Kell 1996, Ullrich \net al. 1996, Karner &amp; Fuhrman 1997). \n\nThe reversion experiments in microcosms produced results that were more informative. \nThey showed a distinct contrast between brackish water and marine bacteria. After the prompt and \n\nB\n\nB\n\nA\n\nA\n\n\n\n \nPhysiological responses of marine and brackish water bacterial assemblages \n\n \n\n 64 \n\npositive response during the initial 2 h incubation in nutrient rich brackish water, the marine \nbacteria, when transferred back to marine water, reverted rapidly to the activity profiles shown by \nthe control. In similar experiments with brackish water bacteria exposed to marine water and then \nreturned to brackish water, the response was negative, rapid and irreversible in the 6 h course of the \nexperiment. This suggests that the high percentage of non-active bacterial cells observed in this \nestuary may result, at least partially, from the impact of the flooding current on brackish water \nbacteria. In fact, at HT, this current brings into the lagoon enough water to increase salinity above \n28 psu in 99% of the total water volume (compared with 35% in LT) (Silva 1994). Alternatively, \nthe irreversible negative responses of brackish water bacteria to marine water in contrast with the \npositive and reversible reactions of marine bacteria to brackish water suggest the presence of \ndistinct bacterial assemblages adapted to the environmental conditions prevailing in different \nsections of the estuary as also found in other estuaries through genetic approaches by denaturing \ngradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rDNA fragments and by low molecular weight RNA analysis \n(Bidle &amp; Fletcher 1995, Murray et al. 1996). The bacterial reactivity speaks against the hypothesis \nof conservative transport in this estuary.  \n\n \n \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nMost (ca 70%) of the bacterioplankton from this estuary was inactive as revealed by \n\nmicroautoradiography. Amendment assays with different nutrients could not stimulate hypothetical \ninactive cells, indicating that this fraction is composed mostly of dead cells. The CTC-reduction \ntechnique used in these assays may not, however, be the best method to detect incipient activity. \nThe small size of the fraction of active cells in the mid-estuary can result from the negative and \nmostly irreversible impact of flooding water on brackish water bacteria as observed experimentally. \n\nThe hypothesis of conservative transport of the upper- and mid-estuary bacteria suggested \nby field data on bacterial abundance and activity in Ria de Aveiro is not sustained by the \nexperimental results obtained in diffusion chambers. These results suggest the presence of 2 \ndifferent communities: (1) a marine zone community, limited by a short supply of nutrients, \nreacting positively to nutrient-rich brackish water (down to 16 psu) and to high salinities (ca 34 \npsu) and (2) a brackish water community, growing in rich water, that reacts negatively and \nirreversibly to salinities above 25 psu. Salinity and nutrient availability seem to control the activity \nof these 2 communities generating an apparently conservative longitudinal continuum. \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \nPhysiological responses of marine and brackish water bacterial assemblages \n\n \n\n 65\n\nLITERATURE CITED \n\n\u2022 Almeida MA, Cunha MA, Alc\u00e2ntara F (in press) Factors influencing bacterial production in a \nshallow estuarine system.

The range of values was about 2 times higher in brackish water than in \nmarine water. At high tide bacterial abundance was 2-3 times lower than at low tide. The overall variation in \nvirioplankton was in the range of 2.4-25.0 x 1010 particles l-1. Brackish water was about 2 times richer in viral \nparticles than the marine water. Near low tide the virioplankton was 2-3 times higher that at high tide. Viral \ndensity followed the pattern of bacterial abundance (it explained 40% of virioplankton variation). The viruses \nto bacterium ratio varied, throughout tidal cycles, by a factor of about 10 establishing the range 4.7-55.6 \n(average 17.6). This ratio was rather similar in the two estuarine zones. We compared the effects of infection \nand predation on the control of bacterioplankton size in the two zones of the estuary. The approach to this \nquestion was conducted in experimental microcosms, set-up in six combinations of plankton variables \naffecting the presence/absence of predators, virus-to-bacterium ratio (10-fold increase), virus-to-bacterium \ndistance (2.2-fold increase), and bacterial growth rate. The results showed that predation was similar, in a \npercent basis, in marine (69%) and brackish water (73%). Viral infection was, however, higher in brackish \nwater (59%) than in the marine water (36%). We conclude that the bacterioplankton along the salinity \ngradient evolves under biological pressures that are in different balance in the marine and brackish water \nzones. The effect of viral lysis on bacterial communities with enhanced growth (after yeast extract addition) \nwas masked even when the initial ratio was 10-fold greater than in the natural samples. The high density of \nthe virioplankton did not preclude the large and rapid increase in bacterial density. We suggest that the \ndynamics of the equilibrium between bacteria and viruses in the environment is driven to higher numerical \nlevels during periods of intensive bacterial growth. On the contrary, at low bacterial growth rates the \ntemporarily increased viruses\u2013to\u2013bacterium ratio may drive the equilibrium to its lowest levels. \n_______________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe growth of bacterioplankton in marine or estuarine water is affected by the \n\nenvironmental values of salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, competition for available nutrients \nas well as by predation (12, 18, 27). More recently a new element of the scenario became obvious \nwhen it was found that viral infection might greatly contribute to bacterial mortality in coastal \necosystems (10, 17, 33, 35). It was also found that bacterial mortality by viral infection might reach \nvalues similar to those of predation by flagellates (10, 34) in the community. Several authors \nreported impacts of viral lysis in the range of 1 to 100% (6, 7, 10, 22, 31). The contribution of viral \nlysis to the overall bacterioplankton mortality depends strongly on environmental conditions and on \nhost community structure (36). The small number of the examined aquatic systems and the \ninsufficient precision of in situ virus-mediated mortality determinations did not allow the confident \nunderstanding of the role of the virioplankton as an ecological mediator in the control of \nbacterioplankton density (36). \n\nThe reported densities of virioplankton in coastal ecosystems range from &lt;107 l-1 to > 1011 \nl-1 (36) but the proportion of the bacteriophage population in the total marine or estuarine \n\n\n\n \nViral infection and predation of estuarine bacteria \n\n \n\n 68 \n\nN\n\nN1\n\nI2\n\nI4\n\nI6\n\nI8 Rio Boco\n\nFigure 1: Ria de Aveiro with \nsampling stations indicated \nby arrows. Station N1, in \nCanal de Navega\u00e7\u00e3o, is in the \nmarine zone of the \necosystem. I2, I4, I6 and I8 \nare brackish water stations \nalong the salinity gradient of \nCanal de \u00cdlhavo. Rio Boco is \na river station. \n\nvirioplankton is not established conclusively. It is widely believed (4, 9, 14), however, that they \nrepresent the major component of the picoplankton. Phage density and infectivity exert strong \nnegative pressure on secondary production and respiration rate in bacterial communities (32, 35). \nHowever, the release of organic matter by viral lysis of different planktonic biota, namely bacteria, \ncan be expected to induce the opposite effect when enhancing bacterial production. \n\nThe experimental approach developed in this work was intended to answer the question on \nthe control of geographical and seasonal evolution of estuarine bacterioplankton density through \npredation and viral infection and effectiveness of this last factor in counteracting intensive bacterial \ngrowth. \n\n \n \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n \n\nStudy site \nRia de Aveiro (figure 1) is a tidal lagoon on the Northwest coast of Portugal separated from \n\nthe Atlantic by a narrow opening. The lagoon covers an area of 66 to 83 Km2 respectively at low \nand high tide (28). It exchanges with the sea a volume of water of 89 Mm3 in tides of 1 to 3 m \namplitude (28). Several rivers carry fresh water into the lagoon with an average water input of 1.8 \nMm3 during a tidal cycle (2). The Ria has a complex topography, with channels spreading from the \n\nmouth towards the streams, \nforming a complex estuarine \necosystem. Canal de Navega\u00e7\u00e3o \nis the main channel, and leads to \nthe smaller channels. Here we \nstudy one of these smaller \nchannels, Canal de \u00cdlhavo (with \na volume of 2.8 Mm3 at LT and \n9.3 Mm3 at HT), that offers the \nadvantages of a straighter water \ncirculation and a diminished \nimpact of agriculture. The \nfreshwater supply to this channel \nis at the south end. \n\n \n \n\n \n\nSampling \nSamples were collected along a longitudinal profile of salinity (Figure 1) during the warm \n\nseason (from early May to early September 1997). Six sampling sites spaced regularly at 3 Km \n\n\n\n \nViral infection and predation of estuarine bacteria \n \n\n 69\n\nwere established along the longitudinal profile of salinity. The stations were numbered, from north \nto south, as N1 and I2 in the Canal de Navega\u00e7\u00e3o; stations I4, I6 and I8 in Canal de \u00cdlhavo and Rio \nBoco (RB, the river). Sampling along the whole profile took place at high tide (HT) and low tide \n(LT). Station N1 ? representing the marine zone (MZ) and Station I6 ? representing the brackish \nwater zone (BZ), were sampled further during two different tidal cycles. Samples were collected \nfrom near-surface water (0.2 m depth) and from deep water (0.5 m above sediment floor), at high \ntide (HT) and low tide (LT) and also at intermediate intervals of 2 hours (HT+2h, HT-2h, LT-2h, \nLT+2h). Water samples were processed within 2-3 hours of collection. \n\n \nMethods \n \n\nPhysical and chemical characteristics. Temperature and salinity readings were obtained with a \nconductivity meter (WTW ? Wissenschaftlich Technische Werkst\u00e4tten, Model LF 196). Dissolved \noxygen concentration, expressed as percentage of saturation, was determined with an oxygen meter \n(WTW, Model OXI 96) equipped with a stirrer (WTW, Model BR 190). The concentration of \nsuspended solids was determined after filtration of triplicate 0.5 l water aliquots through pre-\nweighted and pre-combusted Whatman GF/C filters. The filters were dried at 60\u00baC for 24 hours and \nsuspended solids calculated as the increase in dry weight. The organic matter fraction in the \nsuspended solids was determined as the loss of weight after 4 hours combustion at 525 \u00baC (19). \nParticulate organic carbon (POC) was calculated as 50% of the particulate organic matter (25). \n\n \nBiological characteristics \n\nViruses. Viral particles were harvested from 8-18 ml water sub-samples fixed in 2% \nglutaraldehyde (final concentration) directly onto carbon stabilised formvar-coated 400-mesh \ncopper grids (Labometer). Water centrifugation took place at 28 000 rpm (140000 x g) for 2 hours \nat 20\u00b0C in a Beckman L8-80K ultracentrifuge equipped with a swing-out rotor (SW28). Grids were \nthen stained with 1.5% (w/v) uranyl acetate during 60 seconds (5). Viruses were enumerated on a \nJEOL 100CX TEM at a magnification of 100000x. View fields were shifted randomly and 100 \nmicroscope fields were counted in each preparation. \n\n \nTotal bacterial number (TBN). Bacterioplankton cells were counted by epifluorescence \n\nmicroscopy using a Leitz Laborlux K microscope equipped with a I 2/3 filter for blue light. \nSamples were fixed with 2% formaldehyde (final concentration), filtered through 0.2 \u00b5m black \npolycarbonate membranes (Poretics) and stained with 0.03% acridine orange (13). At least 200 \ncells or 20 microscope fields were counted in each of three replicate preparations. \n\n \nActive bacteria number (ABN). Active bacterial number were determined by \n\nmicroautoradiography (8) after amendment of samples to 30 nM 3H-leucine (Amersham, specific \n\n\n\n \nViral infection and predation of estuarine bacteria \n\n \n\n 70 \n\nactivity 58-92 Ci mmol-1). After 5 hours incubation at in situ temperature, samples were fixed with \nformaldehyde and triplicate subsamples (2-3 ml) of each sample (10 ml) were filtered through 0.2 \n\u00b5m black polycarbonate membranes. The filters were placed, face down, on slides coated with \nautoradiographic emulsion NTB-2 (Kodak) and exposed in total darkness, at 4\u00b0C, for 7 days. The \nslides were developed with Kodak Detkol (one-to-one dilution in ultrapure water) and fixed \n(Kodak fixer). The developed autoradiograms were stained with acridine orange solution (0.04%) \nand hydrated in citrate buffer (0.004 M). Microautoradiographs were examined using a \ncombination of epifluorescence (as above) and bright-field illumination in a Leitz Laborlux \nmicroscope. Cells were counted as active if associated with three or more silver grains. \n\n \nBacterial biomass productivity (BBP). Bacterial biomass productivity was determined in \n\n10 ml-triplicate sub-samples plus a control that was fixed by addition of formaldehyde (2% final \nconcentration). The samples were incubated at a saturating concentration (30 nM) of 3H-leucine \n(Amersham, specific activity 58-92 Ci mmol-1) for 1 hour, at in situ temperature, in the dark. After \nincubation, sub-samples were fixed at 2% formaldehyde. Protein precipitation was performed \nthrough the addition of 1 ml 20% ice-cold TCA followed by incubation for 15 minutes on ice. Sub-\nsamples were then filtered through 0.2 \u00b5m polycarbonate membranes (Poretics), rinsed with 2 ml \n5% ice-cold TCA followed by 5 ml of 90% ice-cold ethanol (3). After standing for 3 days in \nscintillation cocktail UniverSol (ICN Biomedicals, USA) the radioactivity was measured in a liquid \nscintillation counter (Beckman LS 6000 IC). BBP was calculated from leucine incorporation rates \nusing a ratio of cellular carbon to protein of 0.86 and a fraction of leucine in protein of 0.073 (29). \n\n \nChlorophyll a (CHLO). Chlorophyll a was estimated fluorimetrically (37) in a Jasco \n\nspectofluorimeter after filtration of 0,5 l triplicate sub-samples (triplicates) through Whatman GF/C \nfilters and overnight cold extraction in 90% acetone. \n\n \nMicrocosm experiments \n\nThe experimental studies in microcosm conditions was devised to clarify the importance of \nviral infection relative to predation on the control of bacterial growth in marine or brackish water \ncommunities of the estuary. The plan implied the manipulation of viruses-to-bacterium ratio (VBR) \nand the virus-to-bacterium distance (VtB), through differential dilution of bacteria and viruses \npresent in water samples after removal of predators (pre-filtration through 3 \u00b5m membranes). \nDifferential dilution of bacteria (without modification of viral density) was done with predator-and-\nbacteria-free water (filtration of 3 \u00b5m filtered water through 0.2 \u00b5m membranes). Increase in the \nVtB distance (without VBR modification) implied dilution with predator-bacteria-and-viruses-free \nwater (0.2 \u00b5m filtration followed by 0.02 \u00b5m filtration or microwave irradiation). \n\n\n\n \nViral infection and predation of estuarine bacteria \n \n\n 71\n\nWater samples (5 l) were collected at stations N1 and at station I6 from June to September \n1998. To better contrast the conditions in the two sampling stations the water was collected near \nHT at station N1 (in the marine zone) and near LT at station I6 (in the brackish water zone). A 0.5 l \nsub-sample was incubated directly (microcosm 1). The remaining volume was filtered through 3 \n\u00b5m cellulose acetate membranes to obtain predator-free samples. In order to avoid occlusion of \nfilter pores the membrane was changed after filtration of each 0.5 l. Considering the high turbidity \nof the water the risk of large bacterial loss precluded the use of membranes with greater cut-off. \nEven so, filtration through 3 \u00b5m membranes decreased TBN by an average factor of 1.8. A 0,5 l \nportion of this water was incubated (microcosm 2). The 3 \u00b5m-filtrate leftover was filtered at low \npressure through 0.2 \u00b5m polycarbonate membranes, 142 mm in diameter (A.E.B filtration unit, \nModel S.R.L) to generate predators-and-bacteria-free water. This filtrate was used to produce 10-\nfold dilutions of the 3 \u00b5m filtrates to be used in microcosm 3. \n\nIn order to obtain predators-bacteria-and-viruses-free water the previous filtrate was either \nfiltered at low pressure through 0.02 \u00b5m polycarbonate membranes, 25 mm in diameter \n(membranes changed after filtration of 50 ml portions) or inactivated by exposure to microwaves \n(on 19 June, 16 and 23 September). In this case, 50 ml sub-samples of the 0.2 \u00b5m filtrate were \nexposed to 650 W emissions for 3 minutes (3 times 1 minute with intervals of 30 seconds in ice), in \n100 ml screw-capped glass bottles (26). The obtained water served for a 10-fold dilution of the \npredator-free suspension (3 \u00b5m filtrate) causing the simultaneous dilution of bacteria and viruses \nand originating a 2.2-fold increase in VtB distance without changing VBR. This was the suspension \npresent in microcosm 4. \n\nReplicates of suspensions as used in microcosms 3 and 4 were amended with 0.05% yeast \nextract (final concentration) sterilised through 0.2 \u00b5m membrane filtration and autoclaving. They \nwere used to induce high bacterial growth rates and constituted microcosm 5 and 6, respectively. \nTable I summarises the set of the six experiments with the indication of treatment, its effect and \npurpose of the experiment. \n\nSamples of 0.5 l of the six suspensions were incubated in parallel for 24 hours at 20\u00b0C, \nunder agitation (50 rpm in a Lab-line Orbit Shaker), in 1 l acid-washed and sterilised glass \nerlenmeyers. Sub-samples were taken at time 0 and after 6, 12 and 24 hours (t0 to t24) and analysed \nfor total bacteria number and bacterial biomass productivity (in this case only on 16 and 23 \nSeptember 1998). \n\nBacterial loss by predation after 24 hours (Lp24) was calculated as Lp24 = 100 x (cTBN2 \u2013 \nTBN1) / cTBN2, that is, as the percent difference in cell production per initial cell, after 24 hour \nincubation at 20\u00baC. In microcosm 1, predation and infection occurred at near natural conditions. In \nmicrocosm 2, the control, predators were absent. cTBN2 (corrected TBN2) corresponds to total \nbacterial number per ml in microcosm 2 at 24h, corrected for the initial difference in density when \ncompared to microcosm 1. TBN1 represents total bacterial number per ml in microcosm 1 at 24h. \n\n\n\n \nViral infection and predation of estuarine bacteria \n\n \n\n 72 \n\nThe correction compensates for the inevitable initial loss of about 40% cells in microcosm 2 due to \nmembrane filtration (3 \u00b5m nominal porosity). The higher initial bacterial density in microcosm 1 \ncould cause an earlier depletion of nutrients during the 12-24 hour period of incubation that could \nbe misinterpreted as predation. This was not observed, however, as bacteria in microcosm 2 always \ngrew to higher densities than the maximum attained in microcosm 1. \n\n \nTable I: Microcosm set-up for detection of bacterial predation and viral infection in conditions of different \nviruses-to-bacteria ratios, bacteria-to-virus distance and bacterial growth rate. \n \n\nN\n\u00ba \n\nSample treatment  Average VBR \nat onset \n\n Treatment effect/purpose of experiment  \n\n1 None, whole water (W)  18  No treatment. \nEvolution of bacterial and viral populations in \nnon-disturbed microcosm conditions. \n\n2 3 \u00b5m filtration of the \nwhole water (F3) \n\n 18  Removal of predators. \nEvolution of predation (1 vs. 2). \n\n3 Ten-fold dilution with \npredator-and-bacteria-free \nwater (F3 Bd) \n\n 180  Ten fold reduction in bacterial density in the \npresence of a non-modified viral suspension. \nResponse of viral infection when viruses-to-\nbacteria ratio (VBR) was 10-fold increased (4 \nvs. 3). \n\n4 Ten-fold dilution with \npredator-bacteria-and \nviruses-free water \n(F3 Bd Vd) \n\n 18  Simultaneous ten-fold reduction in bacterial \nand viral density causing a 2.2-fold increase in \nvirus-to-bacterium distance (VtB) and no \nalteration in VBR. \nResponse to the experimental minimum in viral \ninfection. \n\n5 As F3 Bd but added of \n0.05% yeast extract at t0 \n(F3 Bd YE) \n\n 180  Substantial increase in substrate concentration. \nViral control of bacterial growth in populations \nstimulated to high productivity when VBR was \n10-fold increased (5 vs. 3). \n\n6 As F3 Bd Vd but added of \n0.05% yeast extract at t0 \n(F3 Bd Vd YE) \n\n 18  Substantial increase in substrate concentration. \nViral control of bacterial growth in populations \nstimulated to high productivity at the \nexperimental minimum in viral infection (6 vs. \n4). \n\n \nBd \u2013 10-fold dilution of bacteria, Vd \u2013 10-fold dilution of viruses; YE \u2013 yeast extract \n\n \nBacterial loss by viral infection after 12 hours (Lv12) was derived from similar \n\ncalculations.

It expresses the percent difference in \ncell production per initial cell, after 12 hours incubation, taking microcosm 3 as the maximum level \nof viral infection and microcosm 4, the control, as the lowest level. cTBN4 corresponded to total \nbacterial number per ml in microcosm 4 at t12h, corrected for any initial difference in density when \ncompared to microcosm 3. TBN3 represented total bacterial number per ml in microcosm 3 at t12h. \nThe incubation beyond 12 hours was not considered because viral infection was partially masked \n\n\n\n \nViral infection and predation of estuarine bacteria \n \n\n 73\n\nJuly 1997\n\nViruses\n\n0\n5\n\n10\n15\n20\n25\n\nN1 I2 I4 I6 I8 RB\n\nStations\n\nx \n10\n\n7  \npa\n\nrt\nic\n\nle\ns \n\nm\nl-1\n\nTotal bacteria\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nN1 I2 I4 I6 I8 RB\n\nStations\n\nx \n10\n\n6  \npa\n\nrt\nic\n\nle\ns \n\nm\nl-1\n\nActive bacteria\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n\nN1 I2 I4 I6 I8 RB\n\nStations\n\nx \n10\n\n5  \nce\n\nlls\n m\n\nl-1\n\nChlorophyll\n\n0\n\n15\n\n30\n\n45\n\nN1 I2 I4 I6 I8 RB\n\nStations\n\n\u00b5g\n l-\n\n1\n\nFigure 2: Profiles of variation in plankton abundance along the \nsalinity gradient: total bacteria, active bacteria, viruses and \nchlorophyll in near-surface water (0.2 m below surface) and in \ndifferent tidal conditions. ??? low tide (spring tide) ???\nhigh tide (spring tide) ---?--- low tide (neap tide) ---?--- high \ntide (neap tide).

The temperature of the water column varied from 16.3 to 26.0 \n\u00b0C, increasing steadily from station N1 to station RB. The highest values were reached near LT. \nThe water column was generally below oxygen saturation showing only occasional high oxygen \nlevels (39-123%). Station I8 was, however, frequently oversaturated (up to 162%). Tidal currents \ndid not develop a clear pattern of variation in the levels of dissolved oxygen. Particulate organic \ncarbon (POC) varied between 3.0 and 12.0 mg l-1 and was higher near low tide. \n \n\nBiological characteristics \nViral density in the estuary \n\nvaried from 2.4 to 25.0 x 1010 \nparticles l-1, establishing a sharp \npattern of enrichment from the \nmarine to the brackish water \nstations (Figure 2) where, on \naverage, the concentration was 2 \ntimes higher.

The range of seasonal variation in bacterial number was considerable (1.9 to 10.6 x \n109 cells l-1) but, in each sampling date, TBN levels increased only 2-3 times along the profile \ntowards the inner section of the estuary (Figure 2). Maximum TBN values were observed near LT \n(Figures 3 and 4). In the marine zone TBN was frequently higher in near-surface water but in the \nbrackish water zone the values were constant down the water column. Active bacteria number (1.0-\n37.3 x 108 cells l-1) showed patterns of variation that followed TBN curves (Figures 2, 3 and 4). \n\nThe ratio of viruses to total \nbacterial number (VBR) was similar in \nthe two estuarine zones but was quite \nvariable (up to 12 times) over tidal \ncycles with the overall range of 4.7 to \n55.6 (average 18).

After 12 hours \nthe loss of bacterial growth \ncorresponded, on average, to 36% (range \n30-41%) in marine water and to 61% \n(range 49-74%) in brackish water \n(Figures 5 and 6 and Table II). \n\nIn microcosm 5 and 6, where \nyeast extract was added to samples that \nwere otherwise similar to experiments 3 \n\nand 4, the effect of the 10-fold increase in VBR (microcosm 5) was undetectable as it was masked \nby the extraordinary increase in TBN (Figure 7). The increment in density reached a factor of about \n5000 in marine water and of about 1500 in brackish water, regardless of the initial value of VBR. \n\nThe response of bacterial productivity during the period of incubation was clear in all \nexperiments. In general, the pattern of variation followed the variation of TBN (Figure 8). In \nmicrocosm 2, however, the increase of BBP when compared to the values in microcosm 1, \noccurred up to 6 hours earlier in brackish water (duplicating the initial value at t12) than in marine \nwater (1.3 increase at t12).

Productivity \nin experiment 3 never reached the values in \nexperiment 4. \n\n \n \n \nDISCUSSION \n\nThe high density of viral community in \nthe water column of the estuary (2.4-25.0 x 1010 \nparticles l-1) immediately suggests a strong \noverall effect on the planktonic system and, \neventually, a modulation of bacterial activity. \nElectron microscopy showed in this work that the \nmajority of the viruses were in the bacteriophage \nsize-range (1). This agreed with the observation \nthat the pattern of geographical, tidal and vertical \nvariation of virioplankton followed bacterial \nabundance as confirmed by regression analysis. \n\nThe microcosm dilution experiments \nwere constructed on serial filtration of estuarine water to remove different biological groups. It has \nbeen commented in the literature (31) that a variable fraction of viruses can be lost by 0.2 \u00b5m \nfiltration (intended for bacterial removal) due, in part, to particle loads in environmental samples. \nThis would result in low filtration efficiency by occlusion of filter pores and/or viral adsorption to \nthe membrane (20). In our case, however, 0.2 \u00b5m filtration was performed through large \nmembranes (142 mm diameter) after 3 \u00b5m filtration, in the hope of reducing these unwanted \neffects. \n\nThe biomass productivity in bacterial populations is usually calculated through the rate of \nincorporation of particular substrates. We conclude, however, that bacterial productivity may be \nelusive in terms of bacterial vitality, as it does not distinguish bacterial growth from viral \nreplication. This is particularly true when VBR was increased as in our experiments.

Average bacterial loss by \npredation was similar, in a percent basis, in marine \n(69%) and brackish water (73%). The contribution \nof predation to bacterial mortality fit within the \nranges reported in the literature (10-80%) for \ncoastal systems (10, 11, 30). Average bacterial loss \nby maximal viral infection (in the conditions of the \nexperiment) was much higher in brackish water \n(61%) than in the marine zone (36%). The \ncontribution of viral infection to bacterial mortality \nin the estuary (average 50%, range 30-74%) was \nhigher or slightly higher than the published values. \nThe frequency of infected cells (FIC) produced \nvalues in the range of 2-74% and the median at \n34% (36). The enrichment of bacterial \nsuspensions with high-molecular-weight-\nconcentrates containing viral particles (HMWC) \nincreased bacterial mortality by 25 to 40% (21, \n23, 24, 33). The direct determination of viral \nproduction elicited the calculation of the lysed \n\ncells fraction as 1-67% of the total (10, 31). Our values are however within the range (25-100%) \nestablished on calculations of virioplankton loss rate (6, 7). \n\n \nBacterial mortality due to viral infection is controlled mainly by the encounter rate between \n\nviruses and their hosts (16). The efficiency of infection in different environments could depend on \nthe numerical ratio between bacteriophages and bacteria.

Such a quick response in bacterial density may not depend \nso much on the hypothetical awakening of dormant cells \u2013 a slow process \u2013 but on the immediate \nintensification of the growth response of already active cells.

Vertical profiles of physical, \nchemical and bacterial variables were studied in the marine and brackish water zones. Transversal profiles of \nthe same variables were studied in the brackish zone only. Although the concentrations of seston (17-241 mg \nl-1), particulate organic carbon (3-15.5 mg l-1) and chlorophyll a (1.2-7.0 \u00b5g l-1) varied widely, the vertical \nand transversal profiles were rather uniform. Total bacterial number (0.2-8.5 x 109 cells l-1) and the number \nof particle-attached bacteria (0.02-2.50 x 109 cells l-1) along vertical and transversal profiles did not differ \nmuch, but bacterial productivity (0.05-14.2 \u00b5g C l-1 h-1) and dissolved organic carbon concentration (6.0-69.2 \nmg l-1) were frequently higher near the salt marsh margin at the brackish water transect. The increase in \nproductivity could not be associated with runoff of particulate matter but coincided with inputs of dissolved \norganic carbon. The results of vertical and transversal profiles point to a minor role of particulate matter \nadditions from the salt marsh area or from bed sediments. \n \nKey words: bacterial productivity, shallow estuary, runoff, resuspension \n \nAbreviations: DOC (dissolved organic carbon), HT (high tide), LT (low tide) \n_______________________________________________________________________________________ \n \nINTRODUCTION \n\nThe distribution of bacterial abundance and production in estuarine systems depends in part \non the location, quantity and quality of the pool of organic matter used as growth substrates (Page \net al., 1995; Goosen et al., 1997; Cunha et al., 2000). Processes involving external transport of \nmaterials to the estuary and exchange of materials between the sediment and the water column may \ninfluence the availability of substrates for bacterioplankton growth (Prahl &amp; Coble, 1994; Goosen \net al., 1995; Hoppe et al., 1996; Hopkinson et al., 1998; Middelboe et al., 1998). \n\nThe input of large quantities of allochthonous organic matter may exert a strong influence \non the carbon flow in the microbial food web in aquatic systems (Coffin &amp; Sharp, 1987). In several \nestuaries the external source of organic carbon was observed to be greater than primary production \n(Vallespinos &amp; Mallo, 1990; Findlay et al. 1992). In the case of the Ria de Aveiro, a shallow \ntemperate estuary, it has been shown (Almeida et al., 2001b) that allochthonous carbon may \nsupport a significant fraction of bacterial production in the cold season and also during the warm \nseason when phytoplankton activity is potentially sufficient to support the whole bacterial \nproduction. The high ratio of planktonic respiration to primary production in this estuary (range 2-\n17, average 4) also suggests the presence of important sources of allochthonous labile carbon \n(Almeida, MA; Cunha, MA &amp; Alc\u00e2ntara, F, unpublished data). The input of allochthonous organic \n\n\n\n \nInfluence of salt marshes and bed sediments on bacterioplankton production \n\n \n\n82 \n\nmatter into this estuary derives in part from rivers and from small freshwater streams but mainly \nfrom diffuse domestic and industrial discharges (Silva, personal communication). It has been \nreported, however, that tidal runoff from salt marshes may also carry important amounts of \nallochthonous organic matter into estuarine systems (Prah &amp; Coble 1994; Hoppe et al., 1996). \n\nThe accumulation of allochthonous and autochthonous carbon on the bottom of aquatic \nsystems, when followed by resuspension can considerably influence heterotrophic processes in the \nwater column of shallow estuaries (Middelboe et al., 1998). Resuspension increases sediment-\nwater exchanges and may result in higher concentrations of organic matter and nutrients for \nplanktonic bacteria (Hopkinson et al., 1998; Middelboe et al., 1998). The complexity of the benthic \ncompartment, including flow characteristics (Nowel &amp; Jumars, 1984), sediment properties (Mehta, \n1988) and biological activity (Rhoads &amp; Boyer, 1982), influences resuspension kinetics. The \nminimum values of tidal current energy causing sediment resuspension have been reported for \ndifferent estuarine systems (Henriksen et al., 1983; Blanchard et al., 1997). For example Lindsay et \nal. (1996) showed that, in the Ford Estuary, sediment resuspension requires a minimum current \nspeed of 0.60 m s-1. Moreover, it has been observed in estuarine systems with relatively high \ncurrent speed that sediment resuspension occurred only in spring tide when the current reached \nspeeds of 6.3-8.9 m s-1 (Medeiros &amp; Kjerfve, 1993). On the other hand, Oliveira et al. (1993) \nreported resuspension events in complex shallow estuaries with much lower current speed (0.2-2.0 \nm s-1). \n\nIt is recognised that other factors including physical (e.g. temperature, water circulation) \nchemical (e.g. salinity, dissolved oxygen) and biological factors are involved in the modulation of \nthe bacterioplankton metabolism (Weisse and Muller, 1998; Shiah et al., 1999; Schultz and \nDucklow, 2000; Wommack and Colwell, 2000). Physical, chemical and biological factors as well \nas substrate availability interact in the regulation of bacterioplankton activity in such a way that it is \noften difficult to discriminate between individual effects and to assess their relative contribution. \nHowever, several studies have demonstrated that the variation in the rates of bacterial activity in \nestuarine and coastal systems might be regulated by temperature, with substrate supply playing a \nlesser role (Berman et al., 1994; Griffith et al., 1994; Shiah and Ducklow, 1995). \n\nDifferent profiles of bacterial production in the estuary Ria de Aveiro have already been \nstudied at the interfaces with the river and with the ocean (Cunha et al., 2000). Stimulation of \nbacterial productivity at the 0.5 meter water layer of the marine zone was attributed to photo-\noxidation of semi-labile or refractory organic compounds and/or to increased phytoplankton \nexudation (Almeida et al., 2110a). The impact of the tide induced changes in salinity was examined \nexperimentally and revealed the presence of two broad bacterial communities distributed \nlongitudinally in the estuary, adapted either to high or to mid salinity ranges and influenced by tidal \ntransport (Almeida et al., 2001c). In this work we intend to outline the effect of salt marshes and \nsediment proximity on bacterioplankton production in shallow waters and to clarify the impact of \n\n\n\n \nInfluence of salt marshes and bed sediments on bacterioplankton production \n\n \n\n 83\n\nFigure 1: Ria de Aveiro with sampling \nstations indicated by arrows.

The tidal range at the mouth varies from 0.6 m \nin neap tides to 3.2 m in spring tides (Dias et al., 2000). \nThe lagoon covers an area of 66 to 83 km2 respectively at \nlow and high tide (Dias et al., 2000). It exchanges with the \nsea a volume of water of 89 Mm3 in tides of 1 to 3 m range \n(Silva, 1994). At the mouth, current speed reaches 0.4-2.4 \nm s \u20131 (Dias et al., 2000). Several rivers discharge fresh \nwater into the lagoon with an average total input of 1.8 x \n106 m3 per tidal cycle (Barrosa, 1985). The Ria has a \ncomplex topography representing a multi-estuarine \necosystem associated with different inflowing rivers. The \ndifferent channels are frequently flanked by low salt \nmarshes. The main channel, Canal de Navega\u00e7\u00e3o, is \nconnected with four second-order channels. In this study, \nwe chose the Canal de \u00cdlhavo, the smallest of the second-\norder channels, 15 km in length, with a water volume of \n2.8 Mm3 at low tide and 9.3 Mm3 at high tide. This \nchannel offers the advantage of a directly water circulation \nas compared with the other three small channels that have \nan irregular and complex geometry. Freshwater is \nsupplied at the south end by a small river, Rio Boco. \nThere is a considerable anthropogenic pressure along this \nchannel, via harbour facilities in the outer section and \naquaculture ponds, industrial plants, diffuse domestic \nsewage inputs in the mid- inner sections. The salt marshes \n\nalong the channel are typically covered by Halimione portulacoides and, among others, by \nSpartina maritima. \n\n \n \n\n \n\nSampling \nEvidence for sediment resuspension was studied in the marine zone and in the brackish \n\nwater zone of the estuary. Salt marsh runoff was investigated only in brackish water where salt \n\n\n\n \nInfluence of salt marshes and bed sediments on bacterioplankton production \n\n \n\n84 \n\nmarshes are more abundant (Figure 1). Sampling took place during the warm season and over \ndifferent tidal cycles at high tide (HT) and low tide (LT) and at intervals of 2 hours (HT+2h, HT-\n2h, LT-2h, LT+2h). Station N1 in the centre of the main channel of the Ria de Aveiro, represented \nthe marine zone (MZ) and was sampled over six tidal cycles (two in June 1996, two in August \n1996 and two in September 1997), five of them in spring tide and one in neap tide, at four depths \n(0.2 m below surface; 4.5 m, 2.5 m and 0.5 m above sediment surface). Transect I6, in Canal de \n\u00cdlhavo, represented the brackish water sections (BW) (Figure 1). It was sampled over four tidal \ncycles (April and May 1997), two in spring tide and two in neap tide, at two depths (0.2 m below \nsurface and 0.5 m above sediment surface). The transect included 4 study sites located between the \nwest margin and the centre of the channel \u2013 S1 close to the margin, S2 one meter from the margin, \nS3 half-way to the centre and S4 at the centre of the channel. In May 1997, surface and deep water \nsamples were also collected at station N1 and at transect I6, only at low tide and high tide, for \ndetermination of dissolved organic carbon. Water samples were processed within 2-3 hours past \ncollection. \n\n \nMethods \n \n\nPhysical and chemical characteristics. Temperature and salinity were measured with a \nconductivity meter (WTW, Model LF 196). Dissolved oxygen concentration, expressed as \npercentage of saturation, was determined with an oxygen meter (WTW, Model OXI 96) equipped \nwith a stirrer (WTW, Model BR 190). Depth of the water column was measured with a Sonar probe \n(Hondex PS-7 LCD Digital Sounder). The concentration of seston was determined after filtration of \ntriplicate 0.5 l water sample aliquots through pre-weighted and pre-combusted Whatman GF/C \nfilters. The filters were dried at 60\u00baC for 24 hours and seston content was calculated as the increase \nin weight due to the dried particulate matter retained. Particulate organic matter was determined \nthrough loss of weight of the dry seston after 4 hours incineration at 525 \u00baC (Parsons et al., 1989). \nParticulate organic carbon (POC) was calculated as the 50% fraction of the particulate organic \nmatter (Rodier, 1996). Samples for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analyses were filtered through \npre-combusted Whatman GF/C membranes and maintained frozen. Quantification of DOC was \ncarried out by combustion and infrared detection in a Total Organic Carbon Analyser (Shimadzu \n5000A). Chlorophyll a was read fluorimetrically (Yentsch &amp; Menzel, 1963) after filtration of 0.5 l \ntriplicate sub-samples through Whatman GF/C filters and overnight cold extraction in 90% (v/v) \nacetone. \n\n \n\nTotal bacterial number and particle-attached bacteria. Total and attached bacteria numbers \nwere determined by direct counting under epifluorescence microscopy (Leitz Laborlux K \nmicroscope) with a 50 W mercury lamp, blue BP 450-490 exciter filter and LP 515 barrier filter. \nThe samples were fixed with 2% formaldehyde (final concentration), filtered through black \n\n\n\n \nInfluence of salt marshes and bed sediments on bacterioplankton production \n\n \n\n 85\n\npolycarbonate membranes of 0.2 \u00b5m (Poretics) and stained with 0.03% acridine orange (Hobbie et \nal., 1977). At least 200 cells or 20 microscope fields were counted in each of three replicate \npreparations. \n\n \n\nBacterial biomass productivity. Bacterial productivity was determined in 10 ml triplicate sub-\nsamples plus a control that was immediately fixed by addition of formaldehyde (2% final \nconcentration). The samples were incubated in the presence of a saturating concentration (30 nM) \nof 3H-leucine (Amersham, specific activity of 58-92 Ci mmol-1) for 1 hour in darkness at in situ \ntemperature. After incubation, sub-samples were fixed at 2% formaldehyde. Protein precipitation \nwas performed through the addition of 1 ml 20% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid followed by 15 \nminutes incubation in ice. Samples were filtered through 0.2 \u00b5m polycarbonate membranes \n(Poretics), rinsed  twice with 2 ml of  5% ice-cold TCA and 5 ml of 90% ice-cold ethanol (Blight et  \n\n \n\nTable 1: Particulate matter in the marine zone \u2013 seston (mg l-1),  POC (mg l-1)  and  chlorophyll a (Chlo) (\u00b5g \nl-1)concentrations at 0.2 m below surface (D1), 4.5 (D2), 2.5 (D3) and 0.5 m (D4) above sediment surface.

Bacterial productivity was negatively and \npositively correlated with salinity and temperature, respectively. \n \n \nDISCUSSION \n\nThe origin and degradability of organic matter in the Ria de Aveiro ecosystem are issues of \ngreat ecological and management interest. It has been reported that estuarine systems with enriched \nsediments and productive flooded margins may develop patterns of tidally induced transfer of \norganic matter and nutrients between their different compartments (Prah &amp; Coble, 1994; Goosen et \nal., 1995; Hoppe et al., 1996; Hopkinson et al., 1998; Middelboe et al., 1998). In the case of the \nRia de Aveiro, the extension of the bordering salt marshes and the considerable turbidity of the \nmid- and inner-sections of the estuary raised the need for considering the eventual relevance of \nsediment resuspension and runoff in the support of a brackish water bacterial community 3 times \ndenser and 3.5 times more productive than the community at the outer estuary. \n\nWhen looking for resuspension events, the comparison of deep and surface water at station \nN1 and transect I6 failed to show (in a total of 10 tidal cycles) any evidence for the expected \neffects. In fact, seston, POC and chlorophyll a concentrations were, in general, similar at the \ndifferent levels of the water column. Bacterial density (total and particle-attached bacteria) and \nproductivity were also rather constant along the vertical profiles in both zones (excluding the 0.5 m \nsurface layer of the marine zone, a phenomenon which is explained by a different logic (Almeida et \nal., 2001a). This was observed even at spring tide when current speed and the area of the flooded \nmargins increased. At the marine water, where tidal current speed can reach values of 2.4 m s-1 \n(Dias et al., 2000), higher than those required for resuspension in other estuarine systems (Oliveira \net al., 1993; Lindsay et al., 1996), the nature of the sediments \u2013 coarse and medium sand \u2013 resisted \nresuspension. Given the sequence of tide induced vertical profiles of seston, the observed increase \nin seston and POC concentrations in deep water at low tide is interpreted as the result of particle \ndeposition in slack water. At the brackish water transect I6, the 0.4 m s-1 current speed (Dias et al., \n2000) was insufficient to resuspend even the fine sand sediment or the organic matter that it \ncontained \u2013 2% (w/w) (Cunha et al., 1999). \n\nWhen the transport of particulate matter through runoff was investigated at ebb tide in the \nneighbourhood of a salt marsh, no evidence could be found along the transect for inputs of seston \nor enrichment in POC or chlorophyll a. Although bacterial density followed this same pattern, \nbacterial productivity increased within the 1 m range from the interface with the salt marsh, \ndenoting the presence of stimulation factors. Newell &amp; Krambeck (1995) found also an increase in \nbacterioplankton productivity (2 fold) after tidal inundation of a cordgrass saltmarsh. The authors \n\n\n\n \nInfluence of salt marshes and bed sediments on bacterioplankton production \n\n \n\n94 \n\ninterpreted these results as due to the increased availability on nutrient from cordgrass shoots \nand/or the marsh sediment. \n\nStatistical analysis showed that POC was not a suitable variable for explaining bacterial \ngrowth variability. Temperature and chlorophyll were the variables that better explained bacterial \nabundance variation (55 % of the variation). Although POC was a variable that also explained \nbacterial density, the relation was negative and only increased the variance accounted by 2 %. \nMoreover, the variation in bacterial productivity was better explained by other variables than POC. \nFor instance, salinity and temperature were responsible for 41% of the total variation. On the other \nhand, we had noticed (Cunha et al., 2000) that the increase in POC was associated with the increase \nin \u00df-glucosidase activity but not with the rate of glucose incorporation. The complex, high \nmolecular weight pool of POC fails to stimulate bacterial growth in a short range of time. The \npositive relationship between bacterial productivity and temperature suggests that bacterial activity \nmight primarily be regulated by temperature, with substrate supply playing a lesser role as \nobserved in other eutrophic and mesotrophic ecosystems (Berman et al., 1994; Griffith et al., Shiah \nand Ducklow, 1995). \n\nEven though DOC distribution in the water column was not fully characterized, it appears \nto be the major form of organic carbon supporting bacterioplankton production in this shallow \nestuary as already observed in other aquatic systems (Hopkinson et al., 1998; Jorgensen et al., \n1999; San\u00fcdo-Wilhelmy &amp; Taylor, 1999; Wikner et al., 1999). In fact, DOC concentration was 3 \ntimes higher than POC along the estuary. The data available at transect I6 indicates that DOC may \nbe the only contribution of salt marsh runoff (2.3 times increase of DOC at the margin) to the high \nbacterial activity at the mid-estuary although it may have only fringe spatial effects. In fact, the \nrough estimate of the volume of runoff may not support a widespread impact of the ebb tide DOC \ninput in the receiving stream. The brackish water sections of the lagoon sum up, depending on tidal \nphase, a volume of water of 51-126 x 106 m3, 2 to 4 times greater than the volume calculated for \nthe deeper outer estuary. The flooded margins cover a maximum area of 17 x 106 m2 (Dias et al., \n2000). Considering that the flooding water is no more than 0.3 m deep, the maximum total volume \nof runoff is about 5 x 106 m3 in each tidal cycle, amounting to a maximum of 10 % of the total \nbrackish water volume at low tide. The doubling in DOC concentration near the margin of the \ntransect does not give enough support to the average 3 and 3.5 times increase, respectively, in \nbacterial abundance and productivity in brackish water; but the DOC may have a positive effect on \nbacterial productivity out of proportion to its relative increase in concentration. \n\nIn view of these results and building on previous studies that revealed planktonic \nrespiration to be 4 times greater than primary production (Almeida, MA &amp; Cunha, MA, \nunpublished data), we conclude that most of the organic matter supporting bacterial activity in the \nRia de Aveiro estuary must be allochthonous. Contributions from the sediment compartment or \nfrom flooded margins proved to be unnoticeable or localized, without any influence. \n\n\n\n \nInfluence of salt marshes and bed sediments on bacterioplankton production \n\n \n\n 95\n\nREFERENCES \nAlmeida MA, Cunha MA, Alc\u00e2ntara F (2001a) Factors influencing bacterial production in a shallow \n\nestuarine system.

The \nnumber of active bacteria (0.1-3.7 x 109 cells l-1) falls also in the same order of magnitude \nregistered for other coastal waters (Lovejoy et al., 1996; Tuomi, 1997; Kisand and Noges, 1998; \nKornas et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Vosjan and van Noort, 1998). The authors have no knowledge of \nany other study quantifying the total active bacterial number in Portuguese estuaries and its \nproportion within the total community. \n\nIn the Ria de Aveiro, as already observed in other systems (del Giorgio and Scarborough, \n1995; Ullrich et al., 1996; Choi et al., 1999; Sherr et al., 1999), a large fraction of the total cell \ncount consists of metabolically inactive bacteria that do not participate in growth. Most of the \nbacteria (about 70 %) were apparently inactive. Although it has been hypothesized that the fraction \nof active cells seems to increase in parallel with the productivity of the system (del Giorgio et al., \n1995), in the Ria de Aveiro, where bacterial production increases by a factor of 3.5 from the marine \nto the brackish water zones, the proportion of metabolically active bacteria in the two zones was \nsimilar. It has been shown, however, that temperature, salinity, predation and viral infection also \nplay a role in determining the relative size of the active and inactive fractions of bacterioplankton \nin aquatic systems (Proctor and Fuhrman, 1990; Shiah and Ducklow, 1994; Rigsbee et al., 1996). \nMoreover, the fraction of inactive bacteria did not respond to nutrient amendment within the period \nof time of 3 hours. When different substrates were added to the bacterial communities of the \nmarine and of the brackish water zones, the proportion of active bacteria was not different from the \ncontrols. The bacterial responses were similar when simple inorganic (e.g. phosphate) or organic \nnutrients (e.g. glucose, amino acids, vitamins) were added, or when a complex yeast extract base or \neven phytoplankton exudates (from diatoms of Ria de Aveiro or from a commercial formula) were \nused. The fraction of active bacteria was similar after 10 minutes, 1, 2 or 3 hours of stimulation \nattempts. It was concluded that the large fraction of inactive bacteria may correspond essentially to \nthe presence of dead cells. However, these results, confronted with the positive reactions obtained \nwith natural water in diffusion chambers, may indicated that a combination of factors may be \nrequired to induce bacterial activation. On the other hand, the negative results of the stimulation \nattempts could, however, be related with the high toxicity of the CTC (Ullrich et al., 1996; Karner \nand Fuhrman, 1997), which would impair the detection of the awakening of cell activity. We may \nalso think that the activation response of bacterial cells may be a slow process that can only be \n\n\n\n \nDiscussion \n\n \n\n 98 \n\nrevealed by CTC-reduction after longer exposures. In fact, Choi et al. (1999) demonstrated that \nsubstantial fractions (30 to 85%) of inactive marine bacterial cells, in what concerns the electron \ntransport system, could become active within 1 to 2 days after addition of organic matter and/or \nincrease in water temperature. \n\n \nIn Ria de Aveiro, in the Douro Estuary (Bordalo et al., 1998) and in some non-portuguese \n\nestuaries (Wright and Coffin, 1983; Kornas et al., 1998) the peaks of bacterial abundance and \nproductivity were observed in the mid-section of the estuary. In the Ria de Aveiro, these peaks \nwere reported to the absolute size of the active bacteria population and to the intensity of their \nactivity rather than to the relative size of the active fraction. Total and active bacterial numbers \nincreased between the outer and the mid-section by the same factor (3 times) and, consequently, the \nfraction of active bacteria remained similar in both sections (26.6 %). The factor of increase of \nbacterial productivity was higher (3.5 times, on average). Specific productivity per cell was similar \nthroughout the estuary but specific productivity per active cell was 19 % higher in the mid-section. \n\n \nIn the brackish water zone, bacterial density and productivity were constant down the water \n\ncolumn, as expected for shallow estuarine systems (Ducklow and Shiah, 1993; Fuks et al., 1994; \nJellet et al., 1996; Talbot et al., 1997). In the marine zone, with the average water depth of 7 m, \nbacterial productivity was significantly higher at surface. Moreover, the stratification of bacterial \nproductivity in the marine zone occurred in the absence of significant physical or chemical \nvariation down the water column. Although a first approach to the explanation of this fact \nsuggested that the increased values at surface water could be associated with phyto- and \nbacterioplankton transport in ebb water, other biological parameters (i.e. total and active bacterial \nnumbers and chlorophyll concentration) were relatively constant along the water column. \nMoreover, turnover rate of glucose and ectoenzimatic activity, determined in the same samples of \nthe marine water, were also constant down the water column (Cunha MA, unpublished data). Even \nthough, phytoplankton distribution could not directly explain the higher bacterial productivity in \nthe half-meter layer of surface water, it was found that irradiation may enhance phytoplankton \nexudation (Zlotnik and Dubinsky, 1989; Feuillade et al., 1990) and consequently bacterial \nproductivity in this water layer. In addition, the higher bacterial productivity at surface water could \nbe stimulated by photochemical transformation of recalcitrant dissolved organic matter into labile \ncompounds that may stimulate locally and transiently the growth of active bacteria. Lindell et al. \n(1995) suggest that solar irradiance (UV-B radiation) may cleave recalcitrant high molecular \nweight dissolved organic matter into smaller fractions, and thereby facilitate bacterial utilisation \nwith the result of an increased bacterial biomass production. Fuks et al. (1994), in the estuary of the \nKrka River, also found enhanced productivity at the surface layer of the water column, but only at \none sampling station, a fact that was interpreted as the result of organic matter transformation. It is \n\n\n\n \nDiscussion \n\n \n\n 99\n\nwell known, however, that the exposure to solar irradiance can influence negatively the production \nand metabolism of heterotrophic bacteria by photoinhibition (Pakulski et al., 1998; Pauz and \nHernd, 1999). The results of Herndl et al. (1993) suggest that bacteria do not adapt to UV-radiation \nas reported for phytoplankton (Helbling et al., 1992). These authors found a reduced activity (as \nmuch as 40 % reduction) in bacteria after exposure to UV-B, and suggested that this was attributed \nto photolysis of extracelular enzymes. The photochemical transformation of recalcitrant organic \nmatter in aquatic systems may then compensate for the loss of enzymatic cleavage of dissolved \norganic matter. In fact, in the Ria de Aveiro the vertical variation of bacterial productivity in the \nmarine zone (possibly due to photochemical transformation and/or enhanced phytoplankton \nexudation) was of the same magnitude as the longitudinal variation between the brackish and the \nmarine water. \n\nIn the brackish water zone the much higher turbidity that reduced light penetration and, \nconsequently photodegradation and/or phytoplankton exudation, may preclude the increase of \nproductivity in surface bacterioplankton. On the other hand, diffusion from the close sediment may \nincrease bacterial productivity in deeper water and consequently, obscure the increase induced in \nthe surface water layer by photodegradation of recalcitrant organic matter and/or phytoplankton \nexudation. \n\n \nShort-term variation of bacterial production associated with tidal currents was observed in \n\nboth zones of the estuary but in brackish water the fluctuation was not, as evident as in the marine \nzone. The fluctuation in bacterial productivity during the tidal cycle resulted not only from the \nfluctuation in total bacterial number (and active bacterial number), but also from the rapid response \nof active cell productivity to the changing water conditions. The variation associated with the tidal \ncycle was not, then, the result of simple mixing and dilution during tidal transport. The exposure of \nmarine and brackish water communities to extremely contrasting conditions (assays in diffusion \nchambers) showed that the marine and the brackish water communities responded quickly and \ndifferently to tidal fluctuation of environmental factors. A decrease was observed in the fraction \nsize of active bacteria and in bacterial productivity of the brackish water community incubated in \nmarine water. Contrastingly, an increase in the fraction of active bacteria and in bacterial \nproductivity of the marine community was observed when it was incubated in brackish water. The \npositive response of marine bacteria to the brackish water conditions was even higher when the \nsalinity was artificially brought to 34 psu. Brackish water bacteria, however, responded negatively \nto the increase in salinity. Moreover, in the reversed experiment the marine community response \nshowed to be reversible (bacteria rapidly re-acquired their previous characteristics) but the response \nof the brackish water community was irreversible (bacteria did not recover from the negative effect \nof exposure to marine water). These results suggested the existence of distinct bacterial \ncommunities adapted to the environmental conditions that prevail at the two zones of the estuary. \n\n\n\n \nDiscussion \n\n \n\n 100 \n\nThe short-term reactivity of the two communities to changes in salinity and in nutrient content of \nthe water column is compatible with the hypothesis of activation and inactivation of bacteria during \ntidal transport, and has implications in the interpretation of estuarine profiles of bacterial activity. \n\n \nThe seasonal effects of bacterial abundance and production in the estuary were quite clear, \n\nwith higher values in the warm season, and agree with other observations in other temperate \nsystems (Heinanen and Kuparinen, 1991; Di Siervi et al., 1995; Yanada et al., 2000). The different \nclimatic conditions were also reflected in the bacterioplankton cell-specific growth rate and in the \nratio between bacterio- and phytoplankton production. The specific growth rate increased during \nthe warm season, as well as the specific growth rate of the phytoplankton, but the ratio of bacterio- \nto phytoplankton production decreased significantly. The seasonal change in this ratio indicated \nthat bacterial production might be essentially supported by phytoplankton carbon during the warm \nseason (21 % of primary production could be potentially sufficient to support the whole bacterial \nproduction) but, in the cold season, the total primary production would be either required or even \ninsufficient to support bacterial production. In this season the estuary turns into a mostly \nheterotrophic system. \n\n \nAmong the set of variables studied (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, seston, POC, \n\nChlorophyll a), temperature was the factor that most influenced bacterial abundance in the estuary. \nBacterial productivity was mostly dependent on temperature and salinity. In the marine zone, depth \nwas also an important factor of bacterial productivity variation as already mentioned. The positive \nrelation of bacterial abundance and productivity with temperature and the negative relation with \nsalinity and depth help to explain the higher values found at low tide and during the warm season. \nIn the brackish water the fraction of the total variation in bacterial density and productivity \nexplained by this set of variables was, however, much smaller than the determined value for marine \nwater. These results suggest the relevance of other variables, namely the size of the supply of \nauthchonous and allochthonous organic matter and the presence of biological control. \n\nIn the Ria de Aveiro the availability of the substrates was one of the main factors of \nbacterioplankton variability. The strength of the bottom-up control by substrate supply varied \nwithin the system, as found in other systems (Shiah and Ducklow, 1995; Shiah et al., 1999). In the \nbrackish water zone, primary production and the estimated allochthonous inputs of organic matter \nwere greater than in the marine zone. Nevertheless, when yeast extract was added to brackish \nwater, the bacterial community responded intensively and quickly. This suggests that the lability of \nthe available organic matter was low and, consequently, that the incorporation of this organic \nmatter by bacteria was dependent of lengthy enzymatic cleavage. In the marine zone the addition of \nyeast extract also increased bacterial growth after 12 hours of treatment. Bacterial density reached \nvalues similar to those obtained in brackish water when added of yeast extract. The marine \n\n\n\n \nDiscussion \n\n \n\n 101\n\nbacterial community also showed a positive response in situ, increasing significantly the \nproductivity at the surface possibly due to enhanced availability of labile organic matter after \nstimulation of phytoplankton exudation and/or photochemical transformation of recalcitrant \norganic matter. On the other hand, the experimental analysis in diffusion chambers showed that the \nmarine bacterial community when exposed to brackish water reacted with enhanced growth. This \npositive response was shown to be due to improved throphic conditions and not to the decrease in \nsalinity. It was noticed that the marine bacteria response was stronger when the salinity of the \nenvolving brackish water was increased from 18 psu to 34 psu. In estuarine systems salinity \ngradients are superimposed on throphic gradients making difficult to distinguish the different sets \nof effects on the communities. \n\nIn Ria de Aveiro, allochthonous organic matter seems to amount to an important source of \norganic carbon. Its contribution to bacterial production was greater in the brackish water zone of \nthe estuary. This confirms the results of others authors who found that in the mid- and inner-estuary \nthe coupling between bacterial production and primary production was lower than in the outer \nestuary (Shiah and Ducklow, 1995). As mentioned above, during the cold season primary \nproduction could not support bacterial production. As a matter of fact, the bacterial \nproduction/primary production ratio varied from 1.0 to 3.6, indicating that other carbon sources \nwere very representative in the estuary. In the warm season, although an average of 21 % of \nprimary production could be potentially sufficient to support the whole bacterial production, in the \nbrackish water zone the estimated allochthonous carbon supply could be responsible for a \nsignificant fraction (41 %) of bacterial biomass growth. The geographical and seasonal variation in \nthe production values showed that, on an annual basis and on a per water volume unit, the balance \nof secondary to primary carbon production was different in the two zones of the estuary. The \nmarine zone was a predominantly autotrophic water mass and the brackish water zone was almost \nat balance in the auto- and heterotrophic growth. Other studies revealed planktonic respiration to be \nfour times greater than primary production in these estuary (Almeida MA and Cunha MA, \nunpublished data), a finding that supports the conclusion that most of the organic matter supporting \nbacterial activity in this estuary is allochthonous. \n\nParticulate organic matter is frequently referred as an important source of organic matter in \nestuarine systems (Murrel et al., 1999). In Ria de Aveiro, however, when the transport of \nparticulate allochthonous matter through runoff was investigated in the neighborhood of a salt \nmarsh in the brackish water zone, no evidence could be found along the transect for inputs of \nseston or enrichment in POC or chlorophyll. The concentration of DOC was, however, 2.3 times \nhigher at the margin. These results suggest that DOC may be the only contribution of salt marsh \nrunoff for bacterial growth in the water mass. In fact, bacterial productivity increased within the 1 \nm range from the interface with the salt marsh denoting the presence of stimulation factors. \nHowever, the rough estimate of the volume of runoff provided by the total flooded area in relation \n\n\n\n \nDiscussion \n\n \n\n 102 \n\nto the total volume of the brackish water may not withstand a widespread impact of the ebb tide \nDOC inputs in the receiving stream. The maximum total volume of runoff amounts to only 10 % of \nthe total brackish water volume at low tide. Consequently, the input of organic matter by runoff \ncould not possibly support the average 3 and 3.5 increase, respectively, in bacterial density and \nproductivity observed in the brackish water zone. The input of allochthonous organic matter to the \nestuary derives mainly from diffuse domestic and industrial discharges (Silva, personal \ncommunication). In fact, along the Canal de \u00cdlhavo there is a considerable anthropogenic impact \nassociated with harbour activities in the outer- and mid-sections, aquaculture pounds, industries, \ndomestic sewage discharges and small agriculture explorations in the mid- and inner sections of the \nestuary. \n\nThe contribution of organic matter from the sediment compartment through resuspension \nproved to be unnoticeable in the marine and in the brackish water zones of the estuary. At the \nmarine zone, where tidal current speed can reach values of 2.4 m s-1 (Dias et al., 2000), higher than \nthose required for resuspension in other estuarine systems (Oliveira et al., 1993; Lindsay et al., \n1996), the nature of the sediments (coarse and medium sand) resisted resuspension. At the brackish \nwater zone, the 0.4 m s-1 current speed (Dias et al., 2000) was insufficient to resuspend even the \nfine sediments. \n\nAlthough the export of particulate materials from bottom sediments was not detected in the \nestuary, in the brackish water zone diffusion from sediments may increase the pool of organic \nmatter and nutrients in the water column. Not even in the brackish water zone, where organic \nmatter content of the sediments was higher (2.9 % of the dry weigh) than in the marine zone (0.5 % \nof the dry weigh) and the water column depth was low (1.3 m, on average), could be detected \nstratification of bacterial productivity as evidence of enrichment at the bottom. If, however, \nbacterial productivity is strongly stimulated at the surface (as in the marine zone) then the lack of \nstratification had to be interpreted as evidence for significant sediment contribution to bacterial \nproduction. Experimental approaches to this subjected will be required. \n\nEven though DOC distribution in the water column of the estuary was not fully \ncharacterised, it appears to be the major organic carbon form regulating bacterial production in this \nshallow estuary, as already observed in other aquatic systems (Hopkinson et al., 1998; Jorgensen et \nal., 1999; Sanudo-Wilhehmy and Taylor, 1999; Wikner et al., 1999). In fact, DOC was 3 times as \nabundant than POC along the estuary and its concentration was 3 times greater in brackish water \nthan in the marine zone. It is also thought that it was the only major carbon contribution of salt \nmarsh runoff into the estuary. The negative association of POC with bacterial abundance and \nproductivity suggests its considerable recalcitrance in this estuary. The complex high molecular \nweight pool of POC fails to stimulate bacterial growth in a short period of time. The low fraction \n(19 %) of particle-attached bacteria in the Ria de Aveiro confirms the small relevance of particulate \nmatter as a source of bacterioplankton carbon. Previous determinations (Almeida and Alc\u00e2ntara, \n\n\n\n \nDiscussion \n\n \n\n 103\n\n1992) showed even a lower fraction (9 %) of bacteria attached to particles in this estuary and that, \ncuriously, the smaller particles showed to be more densely colonized. \n\nIn Ria de Aveiro viral infection may greatly control bacterioplankton density and \nproductivity. The high density of the viral community (2.4-25.0 x 1010 particles l-1) in the water \ncolumn of the estuary (18 times higher than baterioplankton, on average) suggests a strong overall \neffect on the planktonic system and, eventually, on bacterial density and activity. It was found that \nthe majority of the viruses were in the bacteriophage size-range and the patterns of geographical, \ntidal and vertical variation of virioplankton followed bacterial abundance. The experimental data of \nmicrocosm dilution experiments showed that the average bacterial loss by maximal viral infection \n(in the conditions of the experiment) was much higher in the brackish water zone (61 %) than in the \nmarine zone (36 %). The contribution of maximal viral infection to bacterial mortality in the \nestuary (average 50 %, overall range 30-74 %) was higher or slightly higher than published values \n(Steward et al., 1992; Bratback et al., 1993; Peduzzi and Weinbauer, 1993; Weinbauer and \nPeduzzi, 1995a; Fuhrman and Noble, 1995). The effect of viral lysis on bacterial communities with \nenhanced growth (after yeast extract addition) was masked even when the initial ratio of viruses to \nbacteria was ten fold greater than in the natural samples. The higher density of the virioplankton \ndid not repress the large and rapid increase in bacterial density. This unexpected result can be \nattributed to the very rapid growth of non-infected bacteria. In this case, marine viruses would be, \nessentially, selective agents acting on short term temporal fluctuations in the composition of \nbacterial communities but not so much in intensely growing bacterial community. \n\nThe contribution of predation to bacterial mortality fits within the range reported in the \nliterature (10-80 %) for coastal systems (Fuhrman and Noble, 1995; Gonzalez, 1999; Posch et al., \n1999) and, contrary to viral infection, was similar in marine (69 %) and brackish (73 %) waters. In \nbrackish water, the effects of viral lysis and predation to bacterial mortality were similar but in the \nmarine zone predation almost doubled the loss by viral infection. The high level of viral lysis in \nbrackish water, where the throphic conditions are richer and where it could be expected to find an \nincreased percentual value of active bacteria, may keep under control the size of this fraction, \nwhich, in fact, is similar all over the estuary. \n\nPhysical, chemical, nutritional and biological pressures are exerted on the bacterioplankton \nand it shows to be in different balance in the marine and brackish water zones of the Ria de Aveiro. \n\n \n \nCOMPLEMENTARY WORK IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE \n \nSumming up all the results of this thesis one can see that important aspects of the \n\nregulation of bacterial activity in this estuary are still not yet fully understood and some remarks \ncan be made towards further work. \n\n\n\n \nDiscussion \n\n \n\n 104 \n\nDissolved organic matter seems to play, as expected, a major role in the regulation of \nbacterioplankton activity in the Ria. It would be interesting to follow the spatial and seasonal \nprofiles of dissolved organic matter in order to evaluate the relative size of the different sources \nalong the estuary. The major composition of particulate and dissolved carbon could be analysed \nagainst the expression of ectoenzimatic activity as well as against the strength of the exchanges at \nthe interfaces. The increased bacterial productivity found at the surface of the marine zone, mainly \nat ebb tide, suggests a degradation process that may gain further relevance if continued to the \nnearshore. On the other hand, some doubts still persist about the occurrence of a similar process in \nthe shallow brackish water zone of the estuary. This would turn insulation a major factor of \nbacterial productivity. \n\n \nLaboratory experiments demonstrated that when the viruses-to-bacteria ratio was \n\nartificially increased, the virioplankton could play a major role in the regulation of bacterial \ndensity. In order to draw a realistic picture of the contribution of viral infection to bacterial \nmortality in the estuary it will be necessary to find a way to circumvent the difficulty of separating \nloss due to viral infection from obscuring bacterial growth in experimental cosmos. \n\nThe identification of the bacteriophage fraction in the total virioplankton would bring \npreliminary and useful information on the control of infection. Up to now, it has not been reported \nany attempt to distinguish bacteriophages in the whole of the marine virioplankton. \n\n \nThe marine and brackish water bacterial communities in this estuary responded differently \n\nand within short-time intervals to shifts in environmental factors. The distinct response of the two \ncommunities can be interpreted as resulting from intrinsic differences in the composition of the \nbacterial assemblages and/or as deriving mostly from similar bacterial assemblages responding to \nchanging environmental factors. Cross-hybridization of genomic DNA of the two bacterial \ncommunities may provide relevant information to the clarification of this issue. Since viruses are \nhost specific, cross-hybridization of DNA of the virioplankton present in the two communities \nwould further help to distinguish the alternative hypotheses. \n\n \nFor a better assessment of the trophic conditions prevailing in Ria de Aveiro and in order to \n\nintegrate the processes occurring in the estuary, the construction of a numerical model of the \nsystem would be decisively important. The distinct estuarine interfaces, namely with the ocean, the \nfreshwater and the bottom sediments, are certainly areas of enhanced instability and, consequently, \nof different bacterial activity, deserving further analysis. In this analysis are included, among \nothers, the bacterioplankton dynamics, namely in terms of bacterial productivity, size of the active \nbacterial fraction and viral activity. \n\n\n\n \nDiscussion \n\n \n\n 105\n\nIn 2000, an interdisciplinary study was launched in order to construct the first model of the \nRia de Aveiro. The project \"Water quality modeling of the Ria de Aveiro lagoon (MODELRIA)\", \ncoordinated by the University of Aveiro, counts with the participation of the Instituto Superior \nT\u00e9cnico and Hidromod. The validation of the model will take also into account results of previous \nwork developed by the University of Aveiro, including the contribution of the microbial \ncompartment, an important component of the aquatic food web. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \nReferences \n\n \n\n 107\n\nREFERENCES \n\n \nAbreu S, Duarte A (1997) Biogest First Scientific Report - Environment &amp; Climate Programme.
