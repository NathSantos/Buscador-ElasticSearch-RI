Geochemical \nmodeling, a tool used to understand diagenetic processes, is perfor-\nmed through computer codes based on thermodynamic and kinetic \nparameters. In a comparative study, we reproduced the diagenetic \nreactions observed in Snorre Field reservoir sandstones, Norwegian \nNorth Sea. These reactions had been previously modeled in the litera-\nture using DISSOL-THERMAL code. In this study, we modeled the \ndiagenetic reactions in the reservoirs using Geochemist\u2019s Workbench \n(GWB) and TOUGHREACT software, based on a convective-dif-\nfusive-reactive model and on the thermodynamic and kinetic para-\nmeters compiled for each reaction. TOUGHREACT and DISSOL-\nTHERMAL modeling showed dissolution of quartz, K-feldspar and \nplagioclase in a similar temperature range from 25 to 80\u00b0C. In con-\ntrast, GWB modeling showed dissolution of albite, plagioclase and \nillite, as well as precipitation of quartz, K-feldspar and kaolinite in \nthe same temperature range. The modeling generated by the different \nsoftware for temperatures of 100, 120 and 140\u00b0C showed similarly \nthe dissolution of quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase and kaolinite, but \ndiffered in the precipitation of albite and illite. At temperatures of \n150 and 160\u00b0C, GWB and TOUGHREACT produced different \nresults from the DISSOL-THERMAL, except for the dissolution \nof quartz, plagioclase and kaolinite. The comparative study allows \nchoosing the numerical modeling software whose results are closer to \nthe diagenetic reactions observed in the petrographic analysis of the \nmodeled reservoirs. \nKEYWORDS: dissolution; precipitation; sedimentary basins; \nTOUGHREACT; Geochemist\u2019s Workbench.\n\nRESUMO: Rea\u00e7\u00f5es diagen\u00e9ticas, caracterizadas pela dissolu\u00e7\u00e3o e pre-\ncipita\u00e7\u00e3o de minerais a baixas temperaturas, controlam a qualidade \nde rochas sedimentares como reservat\u00f3rios de hidrocarbonetos.

Initially, \noil is generated in a rock rich in organic matter that suf-\nfers a maturation process in specific depth and temperature \n(source rock). The oil then migrates to a porous lithology \nthat will store it (the reservoir rock), where it is trapped by \nanother rock that has low permeability (the seal) (Magoon \n&amp; Dow 1994; Gluyas &amp; Swarbrick 2004). \n\nUnlike the seal rocks, reservoir rocks are characterized by \nhigh porosity and permeability. The reservoirs are normally \ncarbonate rocks (Roehl &amp; Choquette 1985) or siliciclastic \nrocks (Barwis et\u00a0al. 1990), formed as the result of several \ntransformations that occur in the deposited sediments, via \nmodification of the original texture, composition and, conse-\nquently, in the porosity. Such processes are called diagenesis. \n\nThe most common diagenetic processes that affect the \nporosity and permeability of reservoirs are compaction \nand\u00a0precipitation of various types of carbonates, silicates\u00a0and \nother minerals (Tucker 2001). If precipitated as cements \nin significant amounts in the space between the primary \ndepositional constituents, these diagenetic minerals com-\npromise the porosity of the rocks, making them unfeasible \nas a reservoir. Nevertheless, there is also the possibility of \nsubsequent dissolution of diagenetic cements, generating \nsecondary porosity, as occurs in many reservoirs (Bjorlykke \n1984; Schmidt &amp; McDonald 1979; Surdam et\u00a0al. 1984). \n\nThe diagenetic processes allow a variety of minerals to \noccur as cement in sedimentary rocks. The most common \ncements are:\n1. quartz in the form of secondary overgrowths around \n\ndetrital grains and intergranular microcrystals;\n2. K-feldspar as secondary overgrowths or discrete crystals \n\nfilling pores;\n3. carbonates, like calcite and dolomite, siderite and more \n\nrarely ankerite, rhodochrosite and magnesite;\n4. clay minerals, like kaolinite, illite, chlorite,  smectite and \n\ninterstratified mixed-layers (especially  illite-smectite).\n\nClay\u00a0minerals are volumetrically less significant, but \nextremely important, since they commonly occur as rims \nor coatings around grains, exerting enormous influence on \nthe permeability of rocks, damaging the quality of reservoirs \n(Houseknecht &amp; Pittman 1992). \n\nChemical phenomena are the most common during diagen-\nesis, comprising reactions that result in precipitation of authi-\ngenic minerals or secondary dissolution. From the geochemical \npoint of view, these reactions occur because the\u00a0constituents \nof the sediments are always trying to reach equilibrium, and, \ntherefore, tend to interact with the interstitial fluids through \n\ndiagenetic processes (Burley et\u00a0al. 1985). The\u00a0diagenetic pro-\ncesses are controlled not only by temperature (T), pressure (P) \nand the original mineral assemblage, but also by the activi-\nties of the ions dissolved in the formation waters, including \norganic solutes, Eh and pH conditions. \n\nGalloway (1984) establishes three main hydrological \nregimes for fluids within sedimentary basins, related to their \nmovement and occurrence:\n1. meteoric regime, affecting the shallower portions of basins, \n\ncharacterized by infiltration of surface to groundwaters;\n2. compactional regime, linked to expulsion of pore waters \n\ndue to burial;\n3. thermobaric or abyssal regime, associated to the deeper \n\nparts of the basins, where the interstitial fluids are affec-\nted by clay minerals dehydration and oil generation. \n\nGeochemical modeling is a tool used to understand the \ndiagenetic processes. It is performed through computer codes \nbased on thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. However, \nsince there are several mutually-influencing parameters, each \ncode must be used carefully in order to better simulate the \nnatural conditions. In this study, we reproduced the diage-\nnetic reactions observed in the Snorre Field sandstones reser-\nvoir, Norwegian North Sea using Geochemist\u2019s Workbench \n(GWB) and TOUGHREACT software, based on a convec-\ntive-diffusive-reactive model, and the thermodynamic and \nkinetic parameters compiled for each reaction. The Snorre \nField was chosen considering the availability of petrographic \nand stratigraphic data to build a conceptual model of the \ndiagenetic reactions (Baccar &amp; Fritz 1993; Morad et\u00a0al. \n1990). Nevertheless, such study has potential application \nto the modeling of Brazilian reservoirs with similar compo-\nsition, depositional and burial evolution.\n\nBaccar and Fritz (1993) modeled the diagenetic reac-\ntions in Snorre Field reservoir sandstones using DISSOL-\nTHERMAL code. We reproduced the same study using \nGWB and THOUGHREACT codes, so that we could \nevaluate similarities and divergences in the results of each \nsystem according to a wide temperature range. \n\nGEOCHEMICAL \nMODELING APPROACH\n\nAlthough the fundamental concepts of chemical model-\ning have evolved much before, geochemical modeling begins \nin the 1960s, with the pioneering efforts of researchers such \nas Garrels and Mackenzie (1967), Helgeson (1967a, 1967b), \nand Helgeson and James (1968). The first simulations were \noriginally applied to the understanding of the basic issues \ninvolving chemical reactions in aquatic environments related \n\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 45(Suppl 1): 29-40, August 2015\n30\n\nGeochemical Modeling of Diagenetic Reactions\n\n\n\nto pollution of surface waters and assessment of diagenetic \nprocesses (involving natural formation and alteration of rocks). \n\nA geochemical model is really only useful as a tool for pre-\ndiction if there is the possibility to validate the results. In reality, \nthis is the goal that most often is unattainable, due to the com-\nplexity of natural systems, insufficient field data and uncertainties \nrelated to changes in the system over time (Nordstrom 1994). \n\nIn the following sections, the main characteristics of \nTOUGHREACT and GWB, software used in this study, are \ndescribed. We also give some characteristics of the DISSOL-\nTHERMAL code used by Baccar and Fritz (1993).\n\nTOUGHREACT\n\nTOUGHREACT was developed to simulate fluid flow \nnon-isothermal multi-component and geochemical transport, \nin order to investigate problems involving simple and complex \ngeological environments (Xu &amp; Pruess 1998). TOUGHREACT \ncan also use \u201cbatch models\u201d, simulating the reactions in a closed \nsystem. A\u00a0number of thermo-physical and chemical processes, \nwhich occur in the subsurface, are considered under the aspect \nof hydrological and geochemical conditions of pressure, tem-\nperature, water saturation and ionic strength. The\u00a0code uses \nnon-isothermal equations (Pruess 1987; Pruess et\u00a0al. 1999). \nThe numerical solution to the water-rock interaction is based \non finite difference (Narasimhan &amp; Witherspoon 1976). \nThese equations are solved by the Newton-Raphson interac-\ntion (Pruess 1991). The activity coefficient is calculated using \nthe Debye-Huckel equation (Helgeson et\u00a0al. 1981). \n\nKinetic rates (mineral dissolution/precipitation) can be \nexpressed as function of non-basis species as well. Usually \nthe species appearing in rate laws happen to be basis spe-\ncies. In this model, we use a rate expression given by Lasaga \net\u00a0al. (1994):\n\nrn = An . kn . (1 - )\nQ\nK  (1)\n\nwhere positive values of rn indicate dissolution, and negative \nvalues indicate precipitation; kn is the rate constant (moles \nper mineral surface area unit and time unit), which is tem-\nperature dependent; An is the specific reactive surface area \nper kg; and Q/K is the kinetic mineral saturation ratio. The \ntemperature dependence of the reaction rate constant can be \nexpressed reasonably well via an Arrhenius equation (Lasaga \n1984; Steefel and Lasaga 1994). Because many rate constants \nare reported at 25\u00b0C, it is convenient to approximate rate \nconstant dependency as a function of temperature, thus: \n\nkn = k25 . e\n( )-Ea\n\nR\n1\nT\n\n? 1\n298.15\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n (2)\n\nwhere e is Euler\u2019s number; Ea is the activation energy; k25 is \nthe reaction rate at 25\u00b0C; R is gas constant; and T is abso-\nlute temperature.\n\nThe kinetic rate constant kn in equations 1 and 2 only \nconsiders the most well-studied mechanisms in pure H2O \n(at neutral pH). Dissolution and precipitation of minerals \nare often catalyzed by H+ (acid mechanism) and OH- (base \nmechanism). For many minerals, the kinetic rate constant k \nincludes each of these three mechanisms (Lasaga et\u00a0al. 1994; \nPalandri &amp; Kharaka 2004).\n\nGeochemist\u2019s Workbench \nThe GWB system was developed by the Department of \n\nGeology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in \n1978. It is currently marketed by \u201cAqueous Solutions LLC\u201d \n(http://www.gwb.com/). The software allows fast assessment \nof the problems most commonly encountered in geochem-\nical modeling: balance reactions speciation in aqueous solu-\ntion, water-rock interaction models, and fluid mixture in \nconditions of \u201cbatch model\u201d (Bethke 2008). \n\nGWB can integrate thermodynamic and kinetic param-\neters with species processing of geochemical reactions in \nredox environments (Drever 1997). The batch modeling is \na process by which a series of irreversible reactions (no equi-\nlibrium) progress to a state of thermodynamic equilibrium \n(Helgeson et\u00a0al. 1969). These reactions lead to chemical evo-\nlution of a system to reach the equilibrium state. To\u00a0solve \nthe equilibrium of an initial system, GWB determines which \nreactions are more likely to happen. \n\nGWB solves simultaneously a set of non-linear algebraic \nequations, composed by the equation of mass action and the \nequilibrium constant, corresponding to aqueous species, gas \nor minerals that are contained in a database. While GWB \nsolves the equation of mass action, it is solving all the mass \nbalance of the system. The GWB solves the equations using \nNewton-Raphson method. \n\nThe GWB allows the user to build the rate law for the \nreactions kinetics. Settings are available for kinetic dissolu-\ntion/precipitation reactions, redox reactions and microbial \nmetabolism. The pattern that GWB uses for the equation \nof the rate law for the dissolution and precipitation of min-\nerals takes the following form:\n\nrn = As . k + . (1 - )\nQ\nK\n\n (3)\n\nwhere rk is reaction rate; AS is mineral surface area; k+ is rate \nconstant; Q is activity product; and K is equilibrium con-\nstant. The ratio Q/K is known as mineral saturation index. \n\nIn many cases, changes in the temperature will affect the \nrates of reactions in progress. In GWB, the activation energy \n\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 45(Suppl 1): 29-40, August 2015\n31\n\nMarcos Antonio Klunk et al.\n\n\n\nand pre-exponential factor can be used to specify a tempera-\nture-dependent rate, based on the formulation of Arrhenius:\n\nk+ = A . e\n-Ea\nRT\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?  (4) \n\nwhere A is pre-exponential factor; Ea is activation energy; \nR is gas constant; and T is absolute temperature.\n\nDiagenesis is defined as the sum of physical and chemical \nchanges during progressive burial and heating, reflected in \ncompaction owing to known physical processes and to reac-\ntions where minerals are dissolved or precipitated. A\u00a0wide \nvariety of diagenetic reactions occur in sandstones, and \nsome have significant effects on porosity and permeability. \n\nMathematical correlations between \nTOUGHREACT and Geochemist\u2019s \nWorkbench, and kinetic parameters \n\nThe mathematical correlations of TOUGHREACT \nresemble in part those of GWB, but there is an import-\nant difference between them. Solving equation 2, we have: \n\nkn = k25 . e\n-Ea\nRT\n\n? Ea\nR298.15\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n? (5)\n\nkn = k25 . e .e\n-Ea\nRT\n\nEa\nR298.15\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?  (6)\n\nThus, the correlation of GWB with TOUGHREACT is:\n\nk+ . A . e = k25 . e .e\n-Ea\nRT\n\nEa\nR298.15\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n-Ea\nRT\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?  (7)\n\nThe major difference observed in TOUGHREACT is \nthe numerical expression:\n\nk25 . e\nEa\n\nR298.15\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n (8)\n\nThe kinetic parameters used in the simulations are shown \nin Tab. 1. Each software has different numerical methods \nto solve the diagenetic reactions observed in the geologi-\ncal environment. Thus, the kinetic parameters adopted by \neach simulator are submitted to some adjustment factors.\n\nAfter the kinetic parameters are inserted in each software \ninterface, simulators calculate the \u201cglobal rate constant\u201d, \nwhose values are in Tab. 2.\n\nIf we look at two different reference books on the equilib-\nrium constant value of a chemical reaction, there is a big chance \nthat the values found are different (sometimes by a factor of 10 \nor more). This discrepancy is because the constant value may \nhave been determined in different conditions and perhaps using \ndifferent techniques. A common source of variation in published \nvalues of K is the ionic composition of the solution (Harris 2012).\n\nT h e  d i a g e n e t i c  r e a c t i o n s  u s e d  b y  G W B  a n d \nTOUGHREACT are shown in Tab. 3. For GWB, the equa-\ntions are written with a view to all possible chemical equi-\nlibria, as a function of hydrogen ion. The GWB uses hydro-\ngen ions (H+) to assist in the dissociation of minerals, thus \nenabling the adjustment of the stoichiometric coefficients.\n\nDISSOL-THERMAL\n\nThe DISSOL-THERMAL simulator (Fritz 1975, 1981) is \na geochemical code able to predict whether the mineral con-\nstituents are dissolved or precipitated, as well as the composi-\ntion of the solution after the water-rock interaction. Through \nthe attributed concentration of dissolved species, tempera-\nture, pH, and redox potential, DISSOL-THERMAL code \nprovides the diagenetic reactions and calculates the satura-\ntion index of minerals present in the geological environment. \n\nDISSOL-THERMAL is divided into two geochemi-\ncal codes:\n1. DISSOL \u2014 calculates a model for simulating  water-rock \n\ninteractions at a given temperature between 0\u00b0 and \n300\u00b0C; and\n\n2. THERMAL \u2014 calculates a model for simulating the effect \nof temperature variation on water-rock equilibrium.\n\nThese two codes both operate by combining an initial \nsolution saturation test, followed by path calculation (dis-\nsolution or temperature variation). \n\nIn this study, we used the DISSOL-THERMAL modeling \nresults from Baccar and Fritz (1993) and compared to our \nmodeling using GWB and TOUGHREACT simulations.\n\nINITIAL CONDITIONS OF THE \nRESERVOIR AND THE SIMULATION\n\nGeological setting and mineralogy of \nSnorre Field reservoirs\n\nThe Snorre Field is located in the northern part of the \nNorth Sea (Fig. 1). The oil field is situated on the Tampen \n\nBrazilian Journal of Geology, 45(Suppl 1): 29-40, August 2015\n32\n\nGeochemical Modeling of Diagenetic Reactions\n\n\n\nSpur, which is a platform high on the western side of the \nViking Graben (Jurassic-Cretaceous). The main reservoir \nhorizons are fluvial sandstones from the upper member of \nthe Upper Triassic Lunde Formation and the Upper Triassic \nto Lower Jurassic Statfjord Formation (Hollander 1987). \n\nThe Lunde Formation, which is the subject of this paper, is \nthe uppermost formation of the Triassic Hegre Group (Vollset \n&amp; Dore 1984). It was deposited during the thermal subsid-\nence phase following a Late Permian to Earliest Triassic rifting \nepisode (Badley et\u00a0al. 1988; Nystuen et\u00a0al. 1989). The\u00a0Triassic \nto Middle Jurassic sequence on the Snorre Field was uplifted, \ntilted and partly eroded during the Kimmeridgian rifting epi-\nsode in Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous times. The uplift was \nfollowed by subsidence and burial during crustal cooling from \nEarly Cretaceous to Recent (Morad et\u00a0al. 1990).\n\nThe sandstones are dominantly fine- to medium-grained \nand arkosic, having as main framework constituents quartz, \nK-feldspar, plagioclase, muscovite, biotite and clay minerals, \nand as accessory constituents garnet, zircon, rutile, tourma-\nline, staurolite, sillimanite, kyanite and apatite.\n\nSubordinate constituents include extrabasinal quartz-feld-\nspar-mica rock fragments that probably represent granitic \nrocks and/or schists or gneisses. They also include mud and \ncarbonate intraclasts. Micas and detrital clay minerals sel-\ndom make up more than 2% of the total mineral content \nin the sandstones. Clay minerals of detrital origin include \nsmectite, mixed-layer clay minerals, chlorite and subordi-\nnate amounts of kaolinite and illite.\n\nDiagenetic clay minerals include pore-filling kaolinite \nand pore-lining smectite, mixed-layer chlorite-smectite, and \n\nTable 1.

Diagenetic kaolinite also replaces detrital micas and \nfeldspars. Other cements include carbonates, which play a \nsignificant role in porosity reduction in some of the sand-\nstones.

Replacement of calcite by fer-\nroan-dolomite was observed by Morad et\u00a0al. (1990). Ferroan-\ndolomite and ankerite are commonly associated with detrital \nbiotite.

Other minor authigenic cements \ninclude albite overgrowths, pyrite and barite (Morad et\u00a0al. 1990).\n\nThe diagenetic evolution of the upper member of the Lunde \nFormation has been controlled by water-rock reactions acting \nduring deposition, burial through the cooling phase succeeding \nthe Permo-Triassic rifting episode, Kimmeridgian rifting and \nuplift, and post- Kimmeridgian burial. Over this time inter-\nval, four major diagenetic regimes (cf. Schmidt &amp; McDonald \n1979) are recognized:\n1. Eodiagenesis in the late Triassic;\n2. Mesodiagenesis in the late early Jurassic to late Jurassic;\n3. Telodiagenesis in the latest Jurassic through early \n\nCretaceous; and\n\nTable 2.

The\u00a0complete mineral composition of this rock \nis detailed in Tab.\u00a04 and the quantity of each mineral is \nrepresented by volume fraction dissolved per kg of H2O. \nSeawater composition was compiled from Nordstrom \net\u00a0 al. (1979), and the major element composition is \nshown in Tab. 5. Diagenetic events are modeled in the \nfollowing\u00a0temperatures:\n\n ? Event 1: 25, 40, 60 and 80\u00b0C;\n ? Event 2: 100, 120 and 140\u00b0C;\n ? Event 3: 150 and 160\u00b0C.\n\nRESULTS\n\nDiagenetic processes, as predicted by modeling the water-\nrock interaction between 25 and 160\u00b0C using TOUGHREAT \nand GWB, in comparison to DISSOL-THERMAL, are \nsummarized in Fig. 3. The modeling with TOUGHREACT \nand DISSOL-THERMAL showed dissolution of quartz, \nK-feldspar, plagioclase, kaolinite and illite between 25 and \n160\u00b0C. When GWB was used, quartz, K-feldspar, albite, \nillite and kaolinite were precipitated. \n\nAt temperatures of 100, 120 and 140\u00b0C, the 3 differ-\nent modeling systems indicate the dissolution of quartz, \nK-feldspar, plagioclase and kaolinite, converging regarding \ntheir results.\n\nAt temperatures of 150 and 160\u00b0C, GWB and \nTOUGHREACT produce different results from those of \nDISSOL-THERMAL with dissolution of K-feldspar.\n\nAbove 100\u00b0C, we observed similar behavior in GWB and \nTOUGHREACT modeling due to the high kinetics and \nthermodynamics involved in diagenetic reactions, favoring \nthe polynomial equations used by simulators.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nAs showed in the results, the use of different codes produces \ndifferent results during modeling. The convergence of results \nis more evident between TOUGHREACT and DISSOL-\nTHERMAL than between DISSOL-THERMAL and GWB \nsoftware. Generally at low temperatures, the simulation results \nshow some discrepancies, because each software uses different \nnumerical methods to solve a different set of reactions.\n\nThe choice of the software for geochemical modeling \nshould consider the differences of each code, in a way to \nreproduce the reactions of the geological environment of \ninterest with greater approximation of reality.\n\nAt low temperatures (T &lt;80\u00b0C), it is not possible to \nobserve similarity among the results of the different codes \ndue to the low kinetic energy involved in the diagenetic \nreactions. Each simulator has its own algorithms based on \n mathematical codes that are dependent on kinetic and thermo-\ndynamic parameters of each mineral, contained in database. \n\nIn the physical-chemical approach to higher tempera-\nture reactions, the kinetic energy increases to the point \nto generate similar results, regardless of the model. In the \npresent study, it is shown that at elevated temperatures \n(100 to 140\u00b0C) there is an increase in kinetic energy, \nincrementing the intensity of the diagenetic reactions. \n\nTable 4.

These\u00a0equations are \ndependent on kinetic and thermodynamic data of minerals that \nform parageneses in sandstone reservoirs. For temperatures above \n140\u00b0C, these kinetic and thermodynamic data acquire an anom-\nalous behavior for some minerals, indicated by the constant value \nof 500. If the software finds the 500\u00a0value, the previous value is \nused. This is just a reference approach to indicate that that value \nhas not been calculated.\n\nTOUGHREACT uses equations of state (EOS) to cal-\nculate the mass balance. The EOS perform two import-\nant functions:\n1. to calculate the volume fraction of each mineral at the \n\ntime of water-rock interaction;\n2. to use the dissolution/precipitation of minerals identi-\n\nfying the change of each mineral phase.\n\nFrom the variation in the minerals volume, it is possi-\nble to calculate the porosity and permeability. \n\nThe software that is most similar to DISSOL-THERMAL \nin the condition of this study is TOUGHREACT. This sim-\nilarity is due to the mathematical treatment as discretization \ntechnique (method to solve the differential equations) and the \nfinite difference method, providing flexibility in the descrip-\ntion of the geometry of the reservoir. These numerical approx-\nimations increase the resolution of water-rock interaction.\n\nBasically, this comparative study revealed two diagenetic \nstages, taking into account the temperature. The\u00a0first stage \ncorresponds to the temperature range of 25 \u2013 100\u00b0C, and the \nsecond stage, to the temperature range of 120\u00a0\u2013 160\u00b0C. In\u00a0the \nlower temperature stage (25 \u2013 100\u00b0C), TOUGHREACT \nand DISSOL-THERMAL simulators reproduce the diage-\nnetic reactions among minerals albite, anorthite and quartz. \nHowever, GWB and DISSOL-THERMAL software assume \na similarity of geochemical reactions among a larger number \nof minerals such as illite, kaolinite, K-feldspar and anorthite. \nIn the higher temperature stage (120 \u2013 160\u00b0C), we find a \nsimilar behavior in the 3 systems, due to the convergence of \ntheir numerical methods, as it is evident in Fig. 3.\n\nUsers must be careful when choosing a geochemical \nmodeling software because, depending on the tempera-\nture range, different systems can produce very discrepant \nbehaviors. Although GWB and DISSOL-THERMAL sim-\nulators reproduced the largest number of similar diagenetic \nreactions, users must be cautious in interpreting their data.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe present study of geochemical modeling com-\nparing the application of GWB, TOUGHREACT and \n\nDISSOL-THERMAL codes for the simulation of diagenetic \nreactions observed in the Snorre Field reservoir sandstones, \nNorwegian North Sea, resulted in the following conclusions: \n1. Diagenetic modeling at low temperatures (25 to 80\u00b0C) with \n\ndifferent simulators reproduce quite different behaviors. In \nthis temperature range, which involves low energy, the reac-\ntion kinetics and the thermodynamic parameters are treated \naccording to the particularities of each code. The\u00a0numerical \nmethods used by GWB and TOUGHREACT software \nare able to achieve only limited convergence of results, \nwith low precision expected for diagenetic reactions at \nlow-temperature geological environments. \n\n2. For the range of temperature from 100 to 140\u00b0C, in which \nthere is higher kinetic energy involved and consequently\u00a0the \ndiagenetic reactions take place with higher intensity, the\u00a0simu-\nlations with all the three systems generate similar results, \nbecause they use the same mass balance and the same tem-\nperature variation for the precipitation/dissolution of mine-\nrals. The mathematical interpolations used by simulators \nin this temperature range are more stable and numerically \naccurate, giving rise to a greater convergence of results. \n\n3. For higher temperatures, from 150 to 160\u00b0C, GWB and \nTOUGHREACT reproduced the same behavior of disso-\nlution/precipitation of minerals. However, when compared \nto DISSOL-THERMAL code, those results are discrepant. \nIn this temperature range, water-rock interaction has a very \nhigh kinetic energy, causing fast reactions within the geolo-\ngical environments, making the prediction of the reaction \nless possible. In this way, each simulator seeks its own best \nset of numerical solutions to achieve the equilibrium.\n\nUsers must be cautious when choosing geochemical \nmodeling software, as an important factor for choosing a \nsimulator is to know the temperature range that will be used. \nWith the temperature information, the user should make \na preliminary study with the available codes to verify the \nconvergence of results to the observed diagenetic reactions. \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nOur special thanks to Professors \u00c1lvaro Luiz de Bortoli, \nRenata de Matos Galante, and Carla Maria Dal Sasso Freitas, \nand to Ivana Martins for valuable help.
