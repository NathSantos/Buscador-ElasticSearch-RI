I would also wish to express my gratitute for presenting me with such \n\nan enthralling and challenging project, and with that, enabling me to learn a lot more on medicinal \n\nchemistry. Thank you so much for your sympathy, encouragement and guidance during all these \n\nyears, and enlightening me through all your knowledge. Thanks are also owed for allowing me to \n\ntry out my own ideas, which was great, even if they ended up in nothing. \n\n \n\nI would also like to acknowledge Dr. Rita C. Guedes and Dr. Daniel dos Santos for introducing \n\nme to the computational chemistry world, which was key in the attempt of making a hybrid \n\nmedicinal chemist out of me. Thank you so much for your patience, especially in the beginning, \n\nsince I had no background in Linux whatsoever. The tools that I was taught were more than I had \n\never expected and our fruitful discussions helped me reach new hights.  \n\n \n\nI am also in debt with those whose work was undispensable to the completion of this project. I \n\nwould like to thank Professor Phil J. Rosenthal and Dr. Jiri Gut (UCSF) for the antiplasmodial \n\ntesting. \n\nTo Professor Paul M. O\u2019Neill (University of Liverpool), Professor Steve Ward, Dr. Nick Fisher \n\nand Dr. Giancarlo Biagini (LSTMH) for their collaboration regarding the ongoing biochemical \n\nstudies and insightful critics and suggestions. \n\nTo Dr. Filipa P. da Cruz, Dr. Miguel Prud\u00eancio and Dr. Maria M. Mota (IMM) for the tests \n\nregarding the liver stage and the cytotoxicity assays. \n\nTo Dr. Maria do Ros\u00e1rio Bronze and Dr. Isabel Joglar for the mass spectra. \n\nTo RIAIDT at Santiago de Compostela, for performing the elemental analysis and mass \n\nspectroscopy experiments. \n\nTo Dr. Buno Dacunha Marinho (University Santiago Compostela), for performing the X-Ray \n\ncrystallography of my compounds, and his help in the preparation of the first paper. \n\n\n\nTo Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia (FCT), for funding; I will try to make sure it was well \n\nspent money. \n\nI would also want to thank all the technical staff, Sr. Francisco and Lena, for helping me out \n\nwith the material and ordering me reagents. I cross my fingers for Franscisco\u2019s endeavour in \n\nbecoming an EuroMillions winner ends shortly. \n\n \n\nThis project involved quite a lot of lab work and uncountable hours amid smelly solvents. I was \n\nfortunate to come across many funny and pleasant labmates; Jo\u00e3o, Ana, Rita and others, without \n\nwhoom, life at the lab would have been utterly bleak. I thank your interest in my work, abundant \n\ndiscussions and suggestions, and for encouraging me when the molecules didn\u2019t react the way they \n\nwere supposed to\u2026 or at least in my mind.  \n\n \n\nI wish to express my deepest gratitute to my friends. Several pages would be necessary to go \n\ninto details, but thanks are due to Helder for his friendship, and among other things, letting me play \n\ngames on his laptop, discussing about science, UFOs and life in the outter Universe with me, while \n\nsome of the reactions were refluxing downstairs. I am greatly in debt with you for listening about \n\nwhat was bothering me, and giving me your advice for both scientific and personal matters. I would \n\nalso like to thank Rute, Su and Jalmira for their support and friendship. The list goes way beyond \n\nthe limits of this section but rest assured that all of those that I did not mention have not been \n\nforgotten. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements are also due to my family in general, to whom this thesis is dedicated, \n\nparticularly the loving memory of my ancestors; to my parents, for their love and continuous \n\nsupport in all its forms. I certainly wouldn\u2019t be here if you didn\u2019t encourage me to thrive in studies \n\nsince I was very young, and motivating me whenever I was feeling miserable. I believe this is the \n\nresult of a serious dedication to studies, and for that, this is also for you. I hope I have made you \n\nproud! I also thank my always little sister for her love and believing in me. She\u2019s been a focus in \n\nmy life from the day she was born and I held her in my arms. There\u2019s more to life than pursuing \n\nPhD studies and you are the accurate example of how I feel about it. \n\n \n\nI also thank my parents and brother-in-law for their love and always receiving me open-\n\nheartedly, for their understanding when I was absent working, and for cheering me up with their \n\ngood-moods. \n\n \n\n\n\nI praise God for the opportunity to get this far, for it is under His grace that we draw our path. I \n\nalso thank the endless guidance and support; for giving me His hand and shedding light on me, \n\nespecially in the darkest and seemingly unbearable moments of life. A million words are not \n\nenough to express my gratitude! \n\n \n\nFinally, but certainly not least, I wish to thank my beloved wife Cl\u00e1udia for her love and \n\nunconditional support; for being keystone. I wouldn\u2019t have got this far if it weren\u2019t for you. This is \n\nnot only dedicated to you, but also your own accomplishment! \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\ni \n\nGENERAL INDEX \n \n\nGENERAL INDEX ............................................................................................................................ i \n\nINDEX OF FIGURES....................................................................................................................... v \n\nINDEX OF SCHEMES ..................................................................................................................viii \n\nINDEX OF TABLES........................................................................................................................ xi \n\nABSTRACT ....................................................................................................................................xiii \n\nRESUMO ........................................................................................................................................ xiv \n\nLIST OF ABBREVIATIONS AND SYMBOLOGY.................................................................... xv \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\n1.

against malaria. The \n\nmitochondrial electron transport-chain, in which this complex is involved, is fundamental in \n\nPlasmodium sp.. The parasites do not possess the requested enzymatic machinery to salvage \n\npyrimidines from their metabolism and, therefore, have to perform de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis \n\nto enable their survival. Blockage of this pathway leads to their death. The present work focused on \n\nthe development of novel inhibitors with structural similarity to known bc1 complex antagonists. \n\nAlso, this work aimed at delivering novel leads for drug development. \n\n4-Pyridonimines with extended lipophilic side chains showed potential as isosteric replacements \n\nfor 4(1H)-pyridones. The structure of those compounds was derived from structure-based design \n\nand they were active in vitro against P. falciparum. The most active compound presented an IC50 of \n\nca. 1 ?M, and the mode of action was hypothesized through docking studies. \n\nA series of 4-quinolonimines was also prepared. Those presented enhanced antiplasmodial \n\nactivity in comparison to the previous set of compounds, with IC50s ranging from 0.5 to 1 ?M. \n\nThese also showed outstanding activity against the liver stage of P. berghei. Despite the mechanism \n\nof action not being clear at the moment, the compounds demonstrated to bind to hematin. However, \n\nthe docking studies in the Qo site of the bc1 complex also showed a good fit of the compounds. \n\nFlavones were also synthesized with the aim of optimizing the antiplasmodial activity of \n\nstigmatellin. All compounds showed modest activity against both blood and liver stages, with the \n\nmost active compound presenting an IC50 of 6 ?M against P. falciparum W2 strain. \n\nFinally, the virtual screening study that was performed allowed the discovery of novel scaffolds \n\nwith antiplasmodial activity. A combination of ligand- and receptor-based approaches was \n\nsuccessful in retrieving 7 active compounds out of the 23 that were purchased. One of them \n\npresented an IC50 of 2 ?M in vitro. \n\n \n\nKEYWORDS: Cytochrome bc1; 4-pyridonimine; 4-quinolonimine; flavone; molecular docking; \n\nvirtual screening. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nxiv \n\nRESUMO \n \n\nO complexo bc1 \u00e9 um alvo terap\u00eautico atractivo e validado na luta contra a mal\u00e1ria. A cadeia \n\ntransportadora de electr\u00f5es, em que este complexo est\u00e1 envolvido, \u00e9 fundamental em parasitas do \n\ng\u00e9nero Plasmodium sp.. Os parasitas n\u00e3o possuem as enzimas necess\u00e1rias para reciclar as \n\npirimidinas vindas do metabolismo e, por isso, necessitam de sintetiz\u00e1-las de novo, de forma a \n\npermitir a sobreviv\u00eancia do parasita. O bloqueio desta via metab\u00f3lica conduz \u00e0 morte sua morte. O \n\npresente trabalho incidiu no desenvolvimento de novos inibidores com semelhan\u00e7a estrutural a \n\nantagonistas conhecidos do complexo bc1. De igual forma, este trabalho focou-se na descoberta de \n\nnovos prot\u00f3tipos para o desenvolvimento de novos antimal\u00e1ricos. \n\nAs 4-piridoniminas com cadeias lipof\u00edlicas longas mostraram potencial como is\u00f3steros das \n\n4(1H)-piridonas. A estrutura dos primeiros foi derivada de estudos de docking molecular e \n\napresentaram actividade in vitro contra P. falciparum. O composto mais activo possui um IC50 de \n\naproximadamente 1 ?M e o seu modo de ac\u00e7\u00e3o foi posto em hip\u00f3tese por docking molecular. \n\nUma s\u00e9rie de 4-quinolomininas foi tamb\u00e9m preparada. Estas mostraram ser mais activas que a \n\ns\u00e9rie de compostos anteriores, com IC50 entre 0,5 e 1 ?M, tendo mostrado tamb\u00e9m excelente \n\nactividade contra a fase hep\u00e1tica de P. berghei. Apesar do mecanismo de ac\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o ser claro neste \n\nmomento, os compostos mostraram ligar-se \u00e0 hematina. Contudo, os estudos de docking molecular \n\nno s\u00edtio Qo do complexo bc1 podem, igualmente, justificar as actividades obtidas. \n\nFoi sintetizada uma s\u00e9rie de flavonas com o intuito de optimizar a actividade antiplasm\u00f3dica da \n\nestigmatelina. Todos os compostos obtidos mostraram actividade modesta contra as fases sangu\u00ednea \n\ne hep\u00e1tica, com o composto mais activo a apresentar um IC50 de 6 ?M contra a estirpe W2 de P. \n\nfalciparum. \n\nFinalmente, o estudo de screening virtual que foi efectuado permitiu a descoberta de novos \n\nn\u00facleos com actividade antiplasm\u00f3dica. A combina\u00e7\u00e3o de um m\u00e9todo aplicando, de forma faseada, \n\na informa\u00e7\u00e3o de ligandos e do receptor resultou na obten\u00e7\u00e3o de 7 compostos activos, de um total de \n\n23 comprados. Um dos compostos apresentou um IC50 de 2 ?M in vitro. \n\n \n\nPALAVRAS-CHAVE: Citocromo bc1; 4-piridonimina; 4-quinolonimina; flavona; docking \n\nmolecular; screening virtual. \n\n\n\nxv \n\nLIST OF ABBREVIATIONS AND SYMBOLOGY \n\n \n??m   Mitochondrial Electrochemical Gradient \n\nAcOEt   Ethyl acetate \n\nADMET  Absorption, Distribution, Metabolization, Excretion, Toxicity \n\nAIBN   Azobisisobutyronitrile \n\nATP   Adenosine Triphosphate \n\nB3LYP  Becke 3 Lee, Yang, Parr \n\nbr.d   Broad doublet \n\nbr.s   Broad singlet \n\nC   Cysteine \n\nCOSY   Correlation Spectroscopy \n\nCTH   Catalytic Transfer of Hydrogen \n\nD   Aspartic Acid \n\nd   Doublet \n\ndd   Doublet of doublets \n\nddd   Doublet of doublet of doublets \n\nDCC   Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide \n\nDBU   1,8-Diazabicycloundec-7-ene \n\nDEA   Diethylamine \n\nDEPT   Distortionless Enhancement by Polarization Transfer \n\nDFT   Density Function Theory \n\nDMAP   Dimethylaminopyridine \n\nDME   Dimethoxyethane \n\nDMF   N,N-Dimethylformamide \n\nDMF-DMA  N,N-Dimethylformamide-Dimethylacetal \n\nDMSO   Dimethylsulfoxide \n\ndq   Doublet of quartets \n\ndt   Doublet of triplets \n\nE   Glutamate \n\nEI   Electronic Impact \n\nEq.

INTRODUCTION \n \n\n1.1 Overview of malaria and mitochondrial drug targets \nMalaria remains a major infectious disease. Approximately half of the world\u2019s population is at \n\nrisk of infection, with an estimated 300 million new cases annually, and 1 million deaths, mostly \n\nchildren under the age of five [1-3]. Malaria is most prevalent in tropical areas and 90% of all cases \n\noccur in Africa, where the death toll is the highest among endemic regions [4, 5]. Five species from \n\nthe genus Plasmodium cause infection in humans, with Plasmodium falciparum being the most \n\nvirulent, followed by P. vivax.  \n\nThe life cycle of malaria parasites is complex and multi-staged. It includes an asexual cycle in \n\nhumans and a sexual cycle in the Anopheles mosquito. In humans, it can be further distinguished \n\ninto a liver and an erythrocytic stage [6]. During the blood meal, the mosquito transfers sporozoites \n\ninto the blood stream, which conceal from the host immune system by invading the hepatocytes. \n\nThey convert to trophozoites, and divide into several schizonts. After rupture of the hepatocytes, the \n\nmerozoites are released into the blood stream. These invade the erythrocytes and mature into a \n\ntrophozoite. Then, the matured trophozoites divide into schizonts, and the merozoites are released \n\ninto the blood stream to invade other red blood cells. With the rupture of the blood cells, parasitic \n\nwaste and cell debris are released, causing the clinical symptoms of the disease. After a number of \n\nasexual life cycles, the merozoites eventually develop into sexual forms, which are transferred to \n\nthe mosquito during another blood meal. These gametocytes undergo sexual reproduction within the \n\nmosquito mid-gut, producing sporozoites, which finally migrate to the salivary glands and are ready \n\nfor a new infection [6]. \n\nThe swift emergence of multi-drug resistant strains is currently impairing both prophylaxis and \n\nchemotherapy. Thus, there is an urgent need to find novel drugs, for both known and new drug \n\ntargets, that might overcome the clinical resistance to marketed antimalarials [7-10].  \n\nPyrimidine biosynthesis has long been known as a potential target for antimalarial \n\nchemotherapy [11, 12] and presents a set of attractive drug targets. In higher organisms, the electron \n\ntransport-chain is composed of four enzyme complexes, located in the inner mitochondrial \n\nmembrane:  \n\na) NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, complex I; \n\nb) Succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, complex II, succinate dehydrogenase or SDH; \n\nc) Ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase, complex III or cytochrome bc1; \n\nd) Cytochrome c oxidase, complex IV [13]. \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n2 \n\nComplexes II through IV are conserved in Plasmodia, but an alternative type II NADH \n\ndehydrogenase (PfNDH2) replaces complex I. Additionally, other oxidoreductases, such as \n\ndihydroorotate dehydrogenase (PfDHODH) are present in the mitochondria and display an \n\nimportant role in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis.  \n\n \n\n \n\n1.2 The electron transport-chain pathway  \nUnlike many eukaryotic cells, malaria parasites obtain almost all their ATP via glycolysis rather \n\nthan oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondrion [14, 15]. Additionally, sequencing of the malarial \n\ngenome has revealed that genes encoding enzymes from the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway have \n\nbeen conserved, whereas those responsible for salvaging pyrimidines have not [16]. Thus, malaria \n\nparasites rely completely on the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, essential for the formation of \n\nnucleic acids, glycoproteins and phospholipids. Despite its low activity, the mitochondrial electron \n\ntransport-chain (mtETC) is responsible for maintaining an electrochemical gradient (??m) across \n\nthe mitochondrial membrane, as well as a constant pool of ubiquinone for pyrimidine biosynthesis \n[17]. Therefore, the shutdown of the mtETC completely arrests crucial metabolic pathways within \n\nthe microorganism, rendering these enzymes valid and attractive drug targets. Furthermore, these \n\nenzymatic complexes have proven to be structurally different from the homologous human \n\nenzymes, which gave rise to the recent interest from both academia and pharma industry [18-20].  \n\nThree drug targets have been exploited for the discovery of selective inhibitors: PfNDH2, SDH \n\nand cytochrome bc1. The biochemistry, including mechanistic details for these enzymes have been \n\nreviewed elsewhere [21, 22]. In short, PfNDH2 catalyses the electron transfer from NADH to \n\nubiquinone in a ping-pong fashion, to maintain a constant pool of NAD+ for reductive metabolic \n\npathways such as glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle [23]. On the other hand,  SDH feeds \n\nelectrons to complex III, which are ultimately transferred to the final complex [24]. \n\nPfDHODH is the fourth enzyme in the de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidines and catalyses the \n\noxidation of dihydroorotate to orotate at the outer side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. The \n\npair of electrons abstracted from dihydroorotate in this oxidation step is transferred through the \n\nflavin mononucleotide co-factor to ubiquinone, that was generated at the bc1 complex [25-27]. \n\nMoreover, it is thought that the main metabolic function of the mtETC is to regenerate  the \n\nubiquinone necessary for the final step of pyrimidine biosynthesis [28]. Figure 1.1 shows these \n\npathways.  \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \nFigure 1.1 Mitochondrial electron transfer chain enzymes and the interplay with PfDHODH from pyrimidine \n\nbiosynthesis. (Adapted from http://sites.huji.ac.il/malaria/). \n\n \n\n \n\n1.3 Cytochrome bc1 inhibitors \nCytochrome bc1 represents the only enzyme complex common to almost all respiratory electron \n\ntransfer-chains, from Archaea and Bacteria to Eukarya, and its structure has been extensively \n\nstudied [29, 30]. Cytochrome bc1 consists of 11 different polypeptides, three of which display catalytic \n\nfunctions: cytochrome b, cytochrome c1 and the Rieske protein, or iron-sulfur protein (ISP), due to \n\nthe iron-sulfur cluster present in it, Figure 1.2 [31]. The ISP is highly mobile and evidence suggests \n\nthat this feature is crucial for the activity of the complex [32-35]. \n\nTo date, the modified proton-motive Q cycle mechanism provides the most satisfactory model \n\nthat accounts for electron transfer coupled to the proton translocation through cytochrome bc1. This \n\nis thoroughly reviewed elsewhere [21, 22, 34, 36-39]. Briefly, ubiquinol produced by dehydrogenases \n\nupstream to the bc1 complex binds to the oxidation site (Qo) where it is involved in the release of \n\ntwo protons, along with the loss of two electrons into the intermembrane space. Each electron \n\nfollows a separate path, reducing two different acceptors: a) heme bL located in cytochrome b and \n\nb) iron-sulfur cluster in the head domain of the Rieske protein. Next, heme bL reduces heme bH, also \n\nlocated within cytochrome b, which further recycles the electron through the reduction of \n\nubiquinone to ubiquinol at the reduction site (Qi). Meanwhile, the reduced ISP transfers an electron \n\nto the heme c group in cytochrome c1. This transfer is accomplished via a conformational shift, \n\nduring which the histidine acceptor residue at the head group of the ISP rotates, allowing close \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n4 \n\ncontact of the iron-sulfur cluster with heme c. This change is due to the shortening in length of the \n\nhinge segment of the ISP [21, 40]. \n\nThe complex III from numerous organisms has been crystallized with several ligands bound to \n\nthe oxidation and reduction sites, providing further insight into the complex function [31, 39, 41-45].  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1.2 Cytochrome bc1 complex. Image generated from PDB 1KYO, using PyMol \n\n[43, 46]. \n\n \n\n \n\nCytochrome bc1 has been the major drug target in the mtETC, and its inhibitors can be classified \n\ninto four groups according to their binding points. Group I, which includes ?-methoxyacrylates, \n\nbind to the Qo site blocking electron transfer from ubiquinol to the ISP and electron transfer onto \n\nthe bL centre. Group II, which include hydroxyquinone derivatives, also bind to the Qo site, \n\ninhibiting electron transfer from the ISP to cytochrome c1 as well as electron transfer onto the bL \n\ncentre. Group III include Qi site inhibitors, responsible for blocking electron transfer from the bH \n\ncentre to ubiquinone. Finally, a fourth group of chromone inhibitors also block the Qo site, but with \n\ndifferent properties from those of groups I and II [47]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n5 \n\n1.3.1 1,4-Naphthoquinones \n\nCurrently, atovaquone, 1.1, is the only drug targeting the bc1 complex in clinical use [48-50]. \n\nHowever, high levels of resistance, related with point mutations in cytochrome b, have been \n\nobserved for this drug. Consequently, in an attempt to improve its efficiency and decrease the \n\nmutation rate, the drug is now used in combination with proguanil. Mutations are predominantly \n\nrestricted to a highly conserved \u2018PEWY\u2019 region, that helps recognition of ubiquinol, and is implied \n\nin the electron transfer within the Qo site [13]. The most prevalent point mutations conferring clinical \n\nfailure of atovaquone have been assigned to codon 268. A specific change of the in vivo wild-type \n\ntyrosine to asparagine or serine, Y268N/S, was found to increase the IC50 800-10,000 fold, as a \n\nconsequence of an altered fit and binding [51-53]. However, despite being sufficient, the Y268 \n\nmutation seems not to be necessary for treatment failure [51]. Mutation from methionine to \n\nisoleucine on residue 133, M133I, and from leucine to phenylalanine on residue 271, L271F, has \n\ngenerated resistance in vitro and can also be identified in several Plasmodia [54-56]. Other mutations \n\nin positions 258, 267, 272 and 280 have also resulted in a 1,000-fold increase of the drug\u2019s IC50 \n\nvalue [8, 57]. \n\nDue to the lack of a crystallized bc1 complex from malaria parasites, molecular modeling \n\nstudies regarding atovaquone binding to the bc1 complex have been carried out with the \n\nhomologous enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, because of the high sequence homology [58]. \n\nAtovaquone is a competitive inhibitor for ubiquinol that results in collapse of the parasitic \n\nmitochondrial membrane potential, but with no effect on the mammalian counterpart [17]. It binds \n\nwhen the soluble domain of the Rieske protein is proximal to cytochrome b and interacts directly \n\nwith the ISP. This prevents mobilization to cytochrome c1 and, consequently, impairs the ??m [14, 49, \n\n58, 59]. It has been predicted that this drug forms a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group on the \n\nnaphthoquinone ring of the inhibitor and H181 at the ISP. A second water-mediated hydrogen bond \n\nbetween the carboxyl group of E272 and a carbonyl group from the quinone system is also \n\nexpected, Figure 1.3 [58, 60, 61]. Other putative contact residues are I119, F123, Y126, M133, V140, \n\nI141, I144, I258, P260, F264, F267, Y268, L271, V284, L285 and L288 [59, 62, 63].  \n\nAtovaquone displays broad antiprotozoal activity, in the low nanomolar range, on several \n\ndevelopment stages of plasmodia. Moreover, synergism of atovaquone and other naphthoquinones \n\nwith tetracyclines, dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors, and 4(1H)-pyridones has been reported for the \n\nW2 and D6 strains [64-67]. \n\n1,4-Naphthoquinones have long been known to possess antiplasmodial activity. Hydrolapachol, \n\n1.2, for instance, was first reported in the 1940s, and in the same decade the antiplasmodial \n\nscreening of over 300 naphthoquinone derivatives was carried out by Fieser\u2019s group. Lengthening \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n6 \n\nthe isoalkyl side chain of 1.2, by insertion of methylene groups, increased the antimalarial activity \n\nin ducks, to a maximum at C9. Longer side chains decreased activity. The same trend could be \n\nobserved for the n-alkyl series and other related naphthoquinones. Compound 1.3 is almost twice as \n\npotent as its isoalkyl and n-alkyl counterparts. On the other hand, introduction of a ring into the side \n\nchain, e.g. 1.4, shifted the activity peak to compounds with a higher number of carbons in the side \n\nchain, C10 or C11. When two rings are present, as in 1.5-7, the maximum quinine equivalent, Q.E. - \n\nthe ratio of dose of quinine, given in mg/kg, and that of the drug under assay which cause the first \n\nsharp drop in parasitemia in relation to untreated controls [68] - shifts to C12 or C13. All trans \n\ndiastereomers are more potent than their cis isomers, and compound 1.7 with a Q.E. equal to 15.3 is \n\nthe most potent molecule. Moreover, the 2-OH group seems indispensable for activity as loss of \n\nactivity was observed with several other substituents: OMe, SH, Me, H, Cl and NHCOMe. The \n\nsame trend was obtained when substitutions were made in the side chain, and in the naphthoquinone \n\nring. Methyl groups reduced the activity of the compounds when introduced in the core scaffold [68-\n\n73]. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1.3 Atovaquone docked at the oxidation site of the yeast bc1 complex \n\n[58]. \n\n \n\n \n\nMetabolism studies of naphthoquinones 1.3 and 1.4 demonstrated the oxidation of the side \n\nchains, yielding metabolites with significantly reduced antimalarial activity. In fact, compound 1.4 \n\nis rapidly metabolized, and any suppressive activity observed for this compound is due to its long-\n\nlived metabolite 1.8. Thus, hydroxyl groups have been introduced in the following series, resulting \n\nin compounds metabolically more stable, despite having lower activity [70, 74]. \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nHowever, it was noted that an increase in the number of carbon atoms could compensate for any \n\ndrop of activity, and the introduction of an aryl moiety afforded 1.9, which was stable and as active \n\nas 1.4. With these features in mind, a series of hydroxylated naphthoquinones were built, yielding \n\nlapinone 1.10 and other naphthoquinones alike, which displayed high activity and antirespiratory \n\neffect [70, 74-76]. \n\nDue to the emergence of chloroquine resistant strains in the 1960s, a renewed interest in \n\nnaphthoquinones emerged. The synthesis of 3-cyclohexylalkyl and adamantyl 2-hydroxy-1,4-\n\nnaphthoquinone derivatives afforded compounds with good antimalarial activities against P. \n\nberghei. Using chloroquine as a control for suppression of malaria, over 28 days at 5 mg/kg, similar \n\nresults were obtained for 25 mg/kg of 1.11, and menoctone, 1.12, derivatives, while decreased \n\nactivity was observed for the 3-(?-cyclohexylnonyl) homologue 1.13. For the adamantyl series, \n\nactivities were lower, and compound 1.14 cured mice at 40 mg/kg for a week, but at half dose only \n\ntwo of five mice were cleared from parasitemia. Indeed, for 1.14 relapse was noted after 14 days [77, \n\n78]. \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n \n\nIn another study, a series of sixty four 1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives were assayed for curative \n\nactivity on P. berghei. From these, compounds 1.15 and 1.16 displayed good antimalarial activity \n[79].  \n\n \n\n \n \n\nIn 1981, the ongoing effort to find efficient and metabolism-resistant molecules led to the \n\ndiscovery of parvaquone, 1.17, and its cis-dicyclohexyl analogue, 1.18; these were equipotent, and \n\nten times more active than their template menoctone. Introduction of oxygen and nitrogen atoms \n\ninto the cycloalkyl substituent reduced activity [80], while subsequent exploration of the cyclohexyl \n\nsubstituent afforded BW58C, 1.19, a broad spectrum antiprotozoal. This was over 5,600 times more \n\npotent than 1.12, over 1300 times more potent than 1.17, and approximately 650-fold more active \n\nthan chloroquine in in vitro assays. However, in P. yoelii infected mice, BW58C was only four \n\ntimes as active as chloroquine, with and ED50 equal to 1.19 mg/kg, 7 x p.o. The diastereomer \n\nmixture of 1.19 also showed activity on P. cynonolgi and no apparent recrudescence was noted. \n\nFurther studies revealed that it also had prophylactic activity against P. berghei. Nonetheless, in \n\nhumans, the tert-butyl group is rapidly hydroxylated to a 1000-fold less active metabolite and \n\nfurther development was discontinued. Replacement of the tert-butyl by a 4-chlorophenyl group \n\naffords atovaquone, 1.1 [81, 82]. Several structural modifications on atovaquone have been examined, \n\neither to improve activity or the formulation properties of tablets / i.v. dosage forms. Thus, \n\nderivatization of the hydroxyl group in 1.1 as a phosphate or carbamate yielded compounds that \n\nwere shown to be useful for both treatment and prophylaxis of malaria [83-85]. \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n \n\nMore recently, a series of 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinones derived from rhinacanthin, 1.20, \n\nshowed potent antiplasmodial activity. The optimum side chain length was found to have C13, 1.21, \n\nor C15, 1.22, with IC50 values of 32 and 30 nM, respectively, against the K1 multi-drug resistant \n\nstrain. It was also noted that the ?-methyl substituent in the ester moiety was beneficial for \n\nantiplasmodial activity, when compared to its ? and ?-ethyl counterparts. Furthermore, the geminal \n\nmethyl groups in the propyl chain are pivotal for the activity in this series. Compound 1.21 \n\nprovided also specific Qo site inhibition, IC50 = 79.6 \u00b1 3.41 nM, against the homologous yeast bc1 \n\ncomplex, and poor inhibition of the rat enzyme, IC50 = 2,495 \u00b1 820 nM [18]. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nAdditionaly, a series of four unique naphthoquinones isolated from the rootbark of Kigelia \n\npinnata demonstrated useful antiplasmodial activity. 2-(1-Hydroxyethyl)naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-\n\ndione, 1.23, was found to be the most active molecule, with IC50 values of 627 nM and 718 nM \n\nagainst the K1 and T9-96 P. falciparum strains, respectively, Table 1.1. Isopinnatal, 1.24, kigelinol, \n\n1.25, and isokigelinol, 1.26, exhibited lower activities, especially the latter two. Moreover, despite \n\nthe cytotoxicity of these compounds, the antiplasmodial activity was not due to in vitro cytotoxicity, \n\nas the selectivity indexes were of at least 10. The study also suggested that furanonaphthoquinones \n\npossessed much less affinity to parasitic mitochondria when compared to naphthoquinones, and that \n\nminor changes in furanonaphthoquinones would favour accumulation in the parasitic mitochondrial \n\nmembrane. This would eventually increase the activity [86]. \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n \n\n \nTable 1.1 In vitro activity of Kigelia pinnata compounds [86]. \n\nAntiplasmodial Activity  \n\nIC50 (nM)  Compound \n\nK1 strain T9-96 strain \n\n1.23 627 718 \n\n1.24 763 1,552 \n\n1.25 16,660 15,200 \n\n1.26 15,200 11,930 \n\n \n\n \n\nSimilarly, fully synthetic thiophenonaphthoquinones 1.27-32 displayed moderate to good in \n\nvitro activity against P. falciparum at 0.2 ?M, but were not active in vivo, Table 1.2 [87]. \n\n \nTable 1.2 Antiplasmodial in vitro activity of thiophenonaphthoquinone compounds against the BHz 26/28 chloroquine-\n\nresistant strain [87]. \n\n \n\nCompound R1 R2 \n% infection \n\nreduction at 0.2 ?M \n\n1.27 H H 55 \n\n1.28 H 8-OMe 7 \n\n1.29 H 5-OMe 78 \n\n1.30 H 6-OMe 78 \n\n1.31 H 7,8-di-OMe 51 \n\n1.32 2-NO2 H 45 \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n11 \n\nA series of amino-1,4-naphthoquinones was also tested for antiplasmodial activity and 2-amino-\n\n3-chloro-1,4-naphthoquinone, 1.33, was the most potent compound with an IC50 of 180 nM against \n\nthe W2 strain, Table 1.3. The presence of a primary amino group in R1 appeared to be essential for \n\nactivity, since substitution of that group for a halogen, 1.34, decreased activity by 260-fold, while \n\ninclusion of other amino groups at R2, 1.35-37, rendered compounds with only modest \n\nantiplasmodial activity [88]. \n\n \n\n \nTable 1.3 In vitro activity of 1,4-naphtoquinone compounds [88]. \n\n \nAntiplasmodial activity \n\nIC50 (nM) Compound R\n1 R2 R3 R4 R5 R6 \n\nW2 strain D6 strain \n\n1.33 NH2 Cl H H H H 180 920 \n\n1.34 Cl Cl H H H H 43,260 43,980 \n\n1.35 Cl N-pyrrolidino H H H H 9,630 36,650 \n\n1.36 Cl N-morpholino H H H H 31,960 115,140 \n\n1.37 H N-anilino H H H H 47,670 63,970 \n\n \n\n \n\nGiven that the use of metal complexes capable of enhancing the activity of biological \n\ncompounds has become a relevant strategy, a small library of ferrocene derivatives of 1,4-\n\nnaphthoquinone was built, incorporating a modified side chain of 6-8 carbons.

The IC50 of compounds 1.38-40 was 3 to 6-fold higher than that \n\nof atovaquone, hinting that the ferrocene unit is damaging to activity, Table 1.4.

Much work, directed at improving both the antimalarial activity \n\nand the solubility of endochin, 1.41, in water has been carried out. Structural modifications include \n\ncarbonates, N-oxides, Mannich-bases and esters. Introduction of the N-hydroxyl group in the \n\nendochin molecule (BD26235), 1.42, for example, resulted in increased water solubility and in \n\nimproved antimalarial activity [90, 91, 93]. However, substitution of the alkyl side chain for a \n\ncyclopentyl group, or substitution of the methoxy group by a chlorine atom, results in appreciable \n\nloss of activity [94]. A separate study yielded more promising results, with some alkenylquinolones, \n\n1.43-45, displaying activity or curative properties on infected mice. Compound 1.45 had activity \n\ncomparable to that of endochin, with an IC50 of 5.7-16.6 nM, and displayed no cross resistance with \n\nsome marketed antimalarials [95]. Additionally, elimination of the double bond in conjugation with \n\nthe quinolone ring destroyed activity [96]. Compound 1.42, on the other hand, proved to be non-toxic \n\nand was curative in infected chicks. BE11382, 1.46, increased the mean survival time in parasite \n\ninfected mice, suggesting that a substituent at C7 of 3-carboethoxy-4(1H)-quinolones may be \n\nbeneficial [97]. \n\nMore recently, in a search for new scaffolds that comply with the structural features of the \n\n4(1H)-quinolones, an in silico pharmacophore model was employed to screen virtual libraries of \n\ncompounds [98]. Also, based on the structures of WR 194,905, 1.47, and WR 197,236, 1.48, a small \n\nset of compounds was synthesised and important structure activity relationships were drawn. \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n \n\nSimple quinolones without a long alkyl side chain yielded IC50 values of 2.5 ?M, 1.49, 2.3 ?M, \n\n1.50, and 325 nM, 1.51, while compounds with longer side chains were active in the low nanomolar \n\nrange, e.g. IC50 1.2 nM for 1.52. Moreover, evidence suggests a mechanism of action similar to that \n\nof atovaquone, as significant cross resistance was attained against the Tm90-C2B strain. A 3-\n\ntrifluorohexyl group also improved antimalarial activity by 70-fold over the corresponding \n\nunsubstituted counterpart, e.g. 1.53 vs. 1.50 and, more interestingly, no cross resistance to \n\natovaquone was observed. Regarding the metabolism, this substituent may also be interesting since \n\nits terminal location is expected to block cytochrome P450 mediated oxidation. Other structure \n\nactivity relationships that can be drawn are: substitution of 7-OMe for 7-OH reduces activity, and \n\nlengthening of the haloalkyl side chain increases it. This class of compounds also showed \n\nsynergism with 4(1H)-pyridones and inhibition of oxygen consumption at the bc1 complex level [99]. \n\nA summary of antiplasmodial activities can be found in Table 1.5. \n\n \n\n \nTable 1.5 Antiplasmodial activities of 4(1H)-quinolones [99]. \n\nIC50 (nM) \nCompound \n\nD6 strain Dd2 strain Tm90-C2B strain \n\n1.49 > 2,500 > 2,500 > 2,500 \n\n1.50 2,300 1,260 1,290 \n\n1.51 325 303 750 \n\n1.52 1.2 1.2 270 \n\n1.53 32 30 66 \n\n1.54 680 390 1,360 \n\n1.55 1.25 1.44 4.7 \n\n1.56 7.3 5.5 26.6 \n\nEndochin 3.2 2.8 17.4 \n\nAtovaquone 0.3 0.5 5,090 \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n1.3.3 Acridones \n\nRelated acridones have also demonstrated potent antiplasmodial activity, Table 1.6 [100, 101]. \n\nThese reveal structure activity trends identical to the quinolones; those containing a longer side \n\nchain and terminal CF3 groups exhibit higher potencies, with IC50s as low as ~1 pM, 1.78.

While some inhibit the bc1 complex \n\nothers inhibit hematin polymerization [20, 64, 105, 106]. (S)-WR 249685, 1.89, and racemic floxacrine, \n\n1.90, are two selective bc1 complex inhibitors for P. falciparum. Their IC50s for the enzyme are in \n\nthe nanomolar range and consistent with whole cell growth inhibition. Additionally, data suggests \n\nmild cross resistance with atovaquone, associated to bc1 complex mutations. This results in an \n\nincrease of the IC50s, which is an indication of Qo site blocking [20]. Compounds that lack the N-\n\nhydroxyl present in 1.90 have reduced antiplasmodial activity in general; N-allyl derivatives display \n\nmodest activity, while the N-alkyl acridinediones are inactive. Replacement of the ketone function \n\nat the 1-position by an imine, afforded derivatives with comparable activities, and longer side \n\nchains on the imine moiety improved activity. Compounds 1.91 and 1.92 were curative in doses as \n\nlow as 5 mg/kg in mice. Commonly, an aryl moiety at C3 is required for high potency, as alkyl \n\nsubstituents either yield compounds that are devoid of antiplasmodial activity or are marginally \n\nactive. Electron withdrawing groups in the C3-aryl moiety also enhance potency, whereas electron \n\ndonating groups diminish it. Interestingly, a methyl group at C2? of the aromatic ring is not \n\ndeleterious, as opposed to bulkier substituents which decrease the potency. A chlorine located at C7 \n\nis also important for activity, but the lack of any substituents in positions C5 and C8 affords \n\nmolecules with lowered effectiveness [107]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n17 \n\n1.3.5 4(1H)-Pyridones \n\nThe novel class of 4(1H)-pyridones is based on clopidol, 1.93. Clopidol is long known for its \n\nantiplasmodial (curative at 160 mg/kg) and anticoccidal activities through inhibition of \n\nmitochondrial respiration [108, 109]. However, its poor solubility in several solvents led to the \n\nsynthesis of various derivatives [108, 110]. Currently, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is developing a series \n\nof clopidol analogues with more lipophilic side chains in an effort first disclosed in 1991 [111-113]. \n\nCompared to its lead, the n-octyl derivative 1.94 has enhanced activity in vitro, but is inactive in \n\nvivo due to metabolic degradation of the side chain, Table 1.7. Introduction of side chains less prone \n\nto metabolism, 1.95-99, improved not only  the in vitro, but also in vivo activities [19]. \n\n \n\n \nTable 1.7 Antiplasmodial activities of 4(1H)-pyridones: influence of side chain on activity [19]. \n\n \n\nCompound R \nP. falciparum T9-96 \n\nIC50 (nM) \n\nP. yoelii \n\nED50 (mg/kg) \n\n1.93 Cl 20,000 40 \n\n1.94 n-C8H17 4,000 > 60 \n\n1.95 Ph 11,000 22 \n\n1.96 \n \n\n2,500 20 \n\n1.97 \n \n\n50 0.6 \n\n1.98 \n \n\n400 0.7 \n\n1.99 \n \n\n60 0.6 \n\nAtovaquone  3 0.03 \n\n \n\n \n\nFurther structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis on derivatives containing the 3(4\u2019-\n\nphenoxy)phenyl side chain was carried out. A halogen at C5, either chlorine or bromine, leads to \n\nmore potent derivatives. Though, other electron withdrawing substituents at that position do not \n\nimprove activity, and electron donating moieties result in a significant increase of the IC50, Table \n\n1.8. Variation within the terminal aryl moiety does not influence activity significantly, and the \n\nphenoxy side chain is best positioned at 3? or 4?; a much reduced activity is observed for the 2? \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n18 \n\nanalogue, i.e. 1.120. The methyl groups at C2 and C6 also appear to be critical, and significant loss \n\nof activity is achieved upon their withdrawal or their replacement by a trifluoromethoxy group. The \n\nN-oxide derivatives are 10-fold less active than their pyridone counterparts, e.g. 1.125 vs. 1.104 and \n\n1.126 vs. 1.102 [19].  \n\nIn addition to potent activity against erythrocytic stages of malaria, these compounds showed in \n\nvitro and in vivo activity against liver stages, making them amenable to prophylaxis [19, 114]. \n\nADME studies on compound GW844520, 1.113, revealed a half-life adequate for short duration \n\nof oral therapy, activity against resistant isolates, and no cross resistance with atovaquone, among \n\nother features. However, according to the MMV 2005 annual report its development was \n\ndiscontinued due to toxic properties [19, 115, 116].

Since 2006, \n\ntwo further patents from GSK have disclosed structural modifications of the lead compound: \n\ncompounds with biaryl or related side chains at C3, and those containing modified side chains \n\ninstead of methyl groups at C2 or C6 display promising in vitro antiplasmodial activities for \n\nadvanced development [118, 119].

Compounds from this \n\nclass have found applicability in tackling crop pathogens, and as tools for probing the function of \n\nthe bc1 complex [121-127]. Unlike other classes of inhibitors, ubiquinol still binds in the Qo in \n\npresence of these inhibitors, but its electrons cannot be transferred to the ISP. A shift of the relative \n\nposition of the natural ligand due to a conformational distortion of cytochrome b, induced by the \n\nbinding of methoxyacrylates, appears to be the reason [128, 129]. In 1999, 252 compounds were first \n\ndisclosed as having potent antimalarial activity on chloroquine sensitive and resistant strains, a step \n\nthat led to some highly active compounds reported a year later [130, 131]. Compound 1.128 had shown \n\nuseful antiplasmodial activity, but derivatives containing a longer linker, from two to four atoms, \n\n1.129-133, improved activity when compared to 1.128, Table 1.9. The (E,E)-butadiene linker \n\nconferred the better activity to the compounds [131]. \n\n \n\n \nTable 1.9 Antiplasmodial activities of ?-methoxyacrylate against the K1 strain [131]. \n\n \nCompd.

Recently, naphthyl and quinolinyl chalcone derivatives were reported to display \n\nsubmicromolar antiplasmodial activities, 1.147-154, Table 1.10. Generally, quinolinyl and pyridinyl \n\nderivatives are preferred over naphthyl, and 2-quinolinyl over the remainder positional isomers in \n\nvitro. Quinolinyl derivatives presented activities in the low nanomolar range, whereas pyridinyl and \n\nnaphthyl compounds displayed micromolar IC50s. Both methoxy and halogenated chalcones \n\nafforded compounds with good activity and no difference was observed between chloro and fluoro \n\nanalogues [134, 135]. Several other reviews report structural modifications on this attractive scaffold \n[136-139].  \n\n \nTable 1.10 Antiplasmodial activities of selected chalcones [134]. \n\n \nIC50 (nM) \n\nCompound R1 R2 \nW2 strain D6 strain \n\n1.147 3,4-di-OMe 4-quinolinyl 0.50 0.88 \n\n1.148 2,5-di-Cl 3-quinolinyl 1.70 0.62 \n\n1.149 2,5-di-Cl 4-quinolinyl 0.23 0.19 \n\n1.150 3,4-di-Cl 4-quinolinyl 0.80 1.70 \n\n1.151 2-OMe, 5-F 2-quinolinyl 0.67 3.8 \n\n1.152 2-OMe, 5-F 3-quinolinyl 1.10 0.46 \n\n1.153 3-F, 4-OMe 4-quinolinyl 3.20 0.93 \n\n1.154 2-OMe, 5-Cl 3-quinolinyl 0.59 0.95 \n\n \n\n \n\nLicochalcone A, 1.155, is a natural product from Chinese liquorice roots known to inhibit \n\ncytochrome bc1, SDH and falcipain-2 [139-142]. No correlation between falcipain inhibition and \n\nantiplasmodial activity was found, but evidence of a strong inhibitory effect on the mtETC suggests \n\nthat the main mechanism of action might involve the competitive blocking of multiple ubiquinone \n\nbinding sites [143, 144]. Mi-Ichi and co-workers showed that complex II was sensitive to licochalcone \n\nA at an IC50 value of 1.30 ?M, i.e. 10-fold more potent than against the mammalian counterpart. \n\nMoreover, DHODH-cytochrome c activity was sensitive to licochalcone A with an IC50 value of \n\n100 nM, but PfDHODH was not inhibited even at 100 ?M, which means that the bc1 complex is the \n\nmain drug target [144]. \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n22 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n1.3.8 8-Aminoquinolines \n\n8-Aminoquinolines have also been hypothesised to interact with the mtETC complex through \n\ninhibition of Qo / Qi sites, due to the structural similarities with the natural ligand [145-147]. \n\nPrimaquine, 1.156 and other 8-aminoquinoline representatives are, like atovaquone, effective in \n\nboth P. falciparum prophylaxis and leishmaniasis [148-150]. Many related compounds were \n\nsynthesised with respectable activities against murine, primate and avian malaria. Although \n\ninterspecies differences in activity profiles were often observed [151-156]. For example, 1.157 and \n\n1.158 showed causal prophylaxis and cured murine malaria at 20 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively \n[157, 158]. Presently, tafenoquine 1.159 and aablaquine 1.160 are in the final stages of clinical trials \n\nagainst P. falciparum and P. vivax. Further information on the subject can be found in a recent \n\nreview of primaquine-based antimalarials [149]. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n1.3.9 Miscellaneous \n\nMyxothiazol, 1.161, is a group I antibiotic and a potent antimalarial bc1 complex inhibitor with \n\nan IC50 of 33 nM and 695 nM on the D6 and Tm90C2B (atovaquone resistant) strains, respectively \n[47, 159].  \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n23 \n\nStigmatellin A and B, 1.162 and 1.163, block the Qo site and present properties of both type I \n\nand II inhibitors [160]. They bind to the heme bL domain of cytochrome b as well as to the ISP, and \n\ncontain a 5,7-dimethoxy-8-hydroxychromone system with an alkenyl side chain in position 2, \n\nresponsible for the tight binding [44]. Modification of the 8-hydroxy, 5-methoxy or 4-keto groups \n\nleads to partial or complete loss of inhibitory activity. On the other hand, reduction of the chromone \n\nto a chromanone system does not alter the potency significantly, nor this can be achieved by an \n\nalteration of the side chain, as long as the overall lipophilicity is not decreased. Hence the partition \n\ncoefficient of the inhibitor between the aqueous phase and the membrane is of decisive importance \n[47]. The IC50s of 79.2 nM and 147.5 nM for D6 and Tm90C2B showed only a 2-fold loss of activity \n\nto an atovaquone resistant strain, suggesting different binding of that of atovaquone [159]. \n\nMK-4815, 1.164, has been identified to have antiplasmodial activity in whole parasite screens \n\nby Merck &amp; Co. Inc. It has also demonstrated potency against P. falciparum malaria. Its mechanism \n\nof action appears to involve the mtETC of the parasite [120]. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nAntimycin A, 1.165 Figure 1.4, is a dilactone salicylamide, and a potent inhibitor of the Qi site \n\nof cytochrome bc1 with an IC50 of 13 nM and 10.7 nM against D6 and Tm90C2B, respectively [159, \n\n161]. Crystal structures for bovine complex III inhibited by this molecule have been determined. A \n\nstrong hydrogen bond network with the enzyme can be observed. The formamide oxygen hydrogen \n\nbonds with K227, through a water molecule, whereas the nitrogen acts as a hydrogen bond donor to \n\nD228, which also forms a hydrogen bond with the phenol group. A hydrogen bond between the \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n24 \n\nphenolic oxygen and the benzamide is responsible for the co-planarity of the system and the \n\nbenzamide oxygen is involved in a water mediated hydrogen bond to H201 [162, 163].  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1.4 Structure of antimycin  A and cytochrome bc1 interactions \n\n[164]. \n\n \n\nSAR studies on antimycin A analogues suggest that the aromatic region is crucial for activity \n\nand the remainder of the molecule only contributes for proper solubility characteristics, as loss of \n\nactivity is observed by varying the phenol acidity and withdrawal of the formamide group [165, 166]. \n\nSimpler analogues with the replacement of the dilactone moiety for biphenyl ethers, 1.166, were \n\nprepared and showed comparable in vitro inhibitory potency to antimycin A. Therefore, the overall \n\nhydrophobicity is important for proper interaction and fitting in the active site [167]. However, since \n\nthe reactivity of formamide could result in lower in vivo activity, a series of azole-fused \n\nsalicylamides were prepared to circumvent the drawbacks of the previous analogues. Benzotriazole \n\nand indole derivatives with a trifluoromethyl group, 1.167, showed to possess identical activity to \n\nthat of antimycin against the bc1 complex, but low in vivo activity due to weak cell penetration [164]. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFinally, funiculosin, 1.168, a N-methyl-4-hydroxy-2-pyridone antibiotic with a hydrophobic \n\nside chain also inihibits the respiratory chain at the Qi and Qo sites [42, 168-170]. \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n1.4 Aims of the thesis \nThe primary goal of this project was to contribute to the ongoing research of mitochondrial \n\ncytochrome bc1 inhibitors in malaria, providing information on what determinants are crucial for an \n\neffective blocking of the drug target. \n\nTo achieve the goal, the (1H-pyridin-4-ylidene)-amine (or 4-pyridonimine) scaffold, 1.169, was \n\nchosen as a starting point for drug candidate optimization and development, based on the following \n\nobservations: \n\na) Compounds with general structure 1.169 may represent bioisosteres of clopidol, 1.93. \n\nBiososterism is an important tool in rational drug design and the imino group is considered \n\nto be a good replacement for the carbonyl group [171]; \n\nb) Compounds 1.169 derive from similar structures 1.170 that display good in vitro \n\nantiplasmodial activity, but poor chemical stability [172]. The target compounds 1.169 do not \n\ncontain the N-amidomethyl moiety, which is responsible for the reported chemical \n\nreactivity; \n\nc) This molecular simplification strategy allows the use of simple starting materials for the \n\nsynthesis, a major issue for obtaining drugs at an affordable cost. Moreover, the proposed \n\nsynthetic pathway allows the introduction of a large number of structural motifs. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n26 \n\nThis would be conducted by combining theoretical and experimental procedures. A \n\ncomputational chemistry study was carried out to assess the suitability of this scaffold as a 4(1H)-\n\npyridone isostere. This study would also determine the major structural and electronic properties of \n\nthe (1H-pyridin-4-ylidene)amine scaffold that might be relevant for the interaction with the \n\nmolecular target in the parasite. The synthesis through simple building-blocks, in vitro evaluation \n\nagainst P. falciparum strains, and a biochemical model of the bc1 complex, would provide the \n\nproof-of-concept and complete this task, chapters 2 and 3.  \n \n\nIn a second phase, the SAR information withdrawn from the previous series and the literature \n\nwould be used to design a new library of flavone and isoflavone derivatives. The scaffold was also \n\nchosen based on the following premises: \n\na) Stigmatellin, 1.162-163, is a natural chromone-based antibiotic with potent antiplasmodial \n\nactivity [159]; \n\nb) Being a natural product, the access to stigmallin is limited and its chemical synthesis time-\n\nconsuming and exquisitely difficult; \n\nc) The chromone ring in stigmatellin is responsible for binding to the Rieske protein and \n\ncytochrome b. The synthesis of the core scaffold can be achieved through appropriate \n\nstarting materials in a straightforward manner, allowing at the same time the introduction of \n\nlipophilic, yet simpler side chains when compared to that of stigmatellin. \n\nThe in vitro evaluation of the flavone derivatives against different P. falciparum strains would \n\nprovide information on which substituents would be best to carry on in scaffold optimization and \n\nfuture chemical synthesis, chapter 4. \n\n \n\nFinally, with the aim of discovering novel scaffolds capable of inhibiting the bc1 complex for \n\nfuture optimization, a virtual screening study would be carried out, chapter 5. Virtual screening is \n\nwidely regarded as a valuable technique for lead discovery and presents advantages compared to \n\nhigh-throughput screening (HTS). The celerity and its less expensive nature, compared to HTS, \n\nmake this an ideal approach for retrieval of new leads from libraries comprising several thousands \n\nof chemotypes. The validation of the procedure would be achieved from in vitro testing of the \n\nchosen ligands. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \nPYRIDONIMINE SCAFFOLD \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n29 \n\n2. PYRIDONIMINE SCAFFOLD \n \n\n2.1 Quantum mechanical study \n \n\n2.1.1 Brief overview on electronic structure methods and its use in the development of \n\nantimalarial drug candidates \n\nElectronic structure methods use laws of quantum mechanics for its calculations, i.e. the energy \n\nand related properties of a given molecule are obtained by solving the Shr\u00f6dinger equation. Since \n\nthe exact solution is not pratical in most cases, several mathematical approximations are employed \n\nto its solution. Thus, according to the type of approximation, one can classify the electronic \n\nstructure methods in:  \n\na) Semi-empirical methods, e.g. AM1, which use parameters derived from experimental \n\ndata to simplify the equation; \n\nb) ab initio methods, which use no experimental data, and are based solely on the laws of \n\nquantum mechanics (first principles).  \n\nDensity functional methods, or DFT, are similar to ab initio methods, and include the effects of \n\nelectron correlation. Besides the method that one has to choose, there is also a basis set. The basis \n\nset is a mathematical representation of the molecular orbitals within a given molecule. Thus, it is \n\npossible to constrain the calculation with a smaller basis set. On the other hand, a larger basis set \n\nwill represent more accurately the molecular orbitals, but the time required to achieve a result will \n\nbe longer. Therefore, it is necessary to balance the time available to perform a calculation and the \n\ndesired accuracy of the outcome [173, 174]. In malaria these methods have been successfully employed \n\nto model inhibitors of the aggregation of hematin into hemozoin [175-179].  \n\nThis part of the work was developed in parallel with the synthesis of the Mannich-base 4-\n\npyridonimines (Section 2.3) and aimed to study the electronic and molecular structures of those \n\ncompounds, in order to establish relationships between the quantum chemical descriptors and the \n\nantiplasmodial activity of the molecules. Hence, all the synthesized compounds were studied as \n\nwell as other 4-pyridonimines that could be easily obtained from the same synthetic pathway. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1.2 Molecular geometry of 4-pyridonimines \n\nMost of the 4-pyridonimines presented in Table 2.1 were studied in their (E) and (Z) \n\nconfigurations. Also, several conformations were studied for each diastereoisomer to determine \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n30 \n\nwhich one corresponded to the global minimum of energy. The optimized conformations were \n\nfound to be local minima on their potential energy surfaces, following a frequency calculation \n\n(Appendix 1.1 for the energy-minimized structures). Since the structurally-related amodiaquine is \n\nreported to present an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the phenolic oxygen and the nitrogen \n\natoms from the diethylamino group as a free base [180], this series of compounds was also optimized \n\nwith this hydrogen bond. As expected, it was found that the conformers containing a hydrogen bond \n\nbetween the phenolic oxygen and the nitrogen from the diethylamino group provided lower \n\nenergies, i.e. were more stable, when compared to the ones without such bond. Furthermore, the \n\npredicted pKa values for the basic nitrogens on 2.1 are 11.3 for N8\u2019 and 12.5 for N8 [181]. \n\nConsequently, the protonated forms of this compound, 2.2 and 2.3, were also studied, as they would \n\npresent a probable ionization state in aqueous media. For the compounds that were studied in both \n\ntheir (E) and (Z) configuration it was found that the (E) diastereoisomers were more stable than \n\ntheir counterparts, Table 2.2, i.e. when the substituent was on R3 rather than on R1. The only \n\nexception was compound 2.4, where the (Z) diastereomer was marginally more stable than the (E) \n\nisomer. In this case, the predicted lower steric constraint might justify the obtained result. In fact, \n\nthe C3-C4-N8 angle in (Z)-2.4 was very similar to the one observed for (E)-2.24, Table 2.3.

Strong electron-donating substituents at C5 such as NH2, 2.5, and OH, 2.15, \n\nresult in an increase of the angle, when compared to the unsubstituted counterpart, 2.1; \n\nb) Electron-withdrawing substituents such as NO2, 2.9, CO2H, 2.12, or CF3, 2.14, have the \n\nopposite effect, decreasing the C3-C4-N8 angle relatively to 2.1; \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n34 \n\nc) The presence of halogens at C3 does not affect significantly the C3-C4-N8 angle, i.e. \n\n2.10 and 2.16, but the simultaneous subtitution to chlorine at C3 and C5, as in 2.13 and \n\n2.17, increases the C3-C4-N8 angle when compared to 2.1; \n\nd) The nature of substituents in the 4-pyridonimine has practically no impact on the C4-N8-\n\nC1\u2019 angle, which reflects the distance between the substituent and the phenolic moiety. \n\nThe only exceptions were found in molecules 2.13 and 2.17, which presented a \n\nsignificant increase in the C4-N8-C1\u2019 angle, relatively to 2.1. This reveals the impact of \n\nthe steric hindrance imposed by the two chlorine atoms; \n\ne) The C4-N8-C1\u2019 angle increases when the diethylaminomethyl group is protonated, e.g. \n\n2.2; \n\nf) The nature and position of the substituents are responsible for a significant rotation \n\naround the N8-C1\u2019 bond, resulting in a wide range of dihedral angles. Compound 2.17 \n\npresents a narrower C4-N8-C1\u2019-C6\u2019 dihedral angle, when compared to its aryl \n\ncounterpart 2.13;  \n\ng) The predicted dihedral angles were not significantly different from the one observed for \n\natovaquone, C2-C3-C1\u2019-C2\u2019: -116.7\u00ba. Thus, it is expected that these compounds might fit \n\nin a highly convoluted Qo site.  \n\nThese geometry predictions are expected to be accurate as the crystals of 2.8 (Section 2.3.3) \n\npresent bond lengths, angles and dihedral angles that are very similar to the in silico optimized (E)-\n\n2.8, Figure 2.1. Superimposing both structures a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.31 \u00c5 is \n\nobtained. The marginally narrower C4-N8-C1\u2019 angle and the wider C4-N8-C1\u2019-C6\u2019 dihedral angle \n\nin the optimized structure leads to a minor displacement of the 4-pyridonimine scaffold, compared \n\nto the crystallized molecule.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.1 In silico optimized (E)-2.8 (green) superimposed with VMD 1.8.6 [182] to the crystallized atomic coordinates \n\n(red, RMSD = 0.31\u00c5). \n\n \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n35 \n\n2.1.3 Frontier orbital energies and densities \n\nFrontier orbital electron densities on molecules provide a useful mean for the detailed \n\ncharacterization of donor-acceptor interactions. It has been shown that these orbitals play a major \n\nrole in governing many chemical reactions. For example, they can account for the formation of \n\nmany transfer complexes. The energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is directly \n\nrelated to the ionization potential and characterizes the susceptibility of the molecule towards an \n\nattack by electrophiles. On the other hand, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is \n\nrelated with electron affinity, and gives an idea of the susceptibility of the molecule towards \n\nnucleophilic attack [183]. \n\nThe energies associated with the studied compounds were small, ranging between -0.27 eV and \n\n-0.16 eV for HOMO, and between -0.12 eV and -0.01 eV for LUMO, with exception of compound \n\n2.3. This indicates the fragile nature of bound electrons. Also, the small HOMO-LUMO gap \n\npermits electron exchange and transfer, making these compounds very reactive. Further analysis of \n\nthe LUMOs in Figure 2.2 and Table 2.2 result in the following observations: \n\na) Compounds with higher antiplasmodial activity, Table 2.12,  are the ones with less \n\nnegative HOMOs (~ -0.16 eV) and LUMOs (~ -0.01 eV), indicating that the substitutions \n\nthat affect these energies could have a direct impact on the antiplasmodial activity; \n\nb) The LUMOs of clopidol and atovaquone show that the 4(1H)-pyridone and the quinone \n\nmoieties are prone to nucleophilic attack, like all the 4-pyridonimine moieties within the \n\nmost stable diastereomers studied. Interestingly, the LUMO of clopidol has a similar \n\nform to that of pyridinium salts [184], which are also related to the 4-pyridonimines; \n\nc) The quaternary ammonium salts, where the diethylamino group is either methylated, 2.7 \n\nand 2.8, or protonated, 2.2, present the LUMOs located in the aryl moiety. The HOMOs \n\nshow smaller energies, implying the susceptibility to nucleophilic attack in this region; \n\nd) The most pronounced similarities of the LUMO profile from 4-pyridonimines with \n\nclopidol occur when the scaffold presents no substituent, an electron-donor group or a \n\nhalogen, as is the case of compounds 2.1, 2.3-6, 2.10, 2.15, and 2.16;  \n\ne) Non-halogen electron-withdrawing groups, i.e. 2.9, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.14, appear to distort \n\nthe symmetry observed for the remaining cases; \n\nf) Compounds 2.13 and 2.17 reveal a near-identical pattern, pinpointing that the side-chain \n\nmay not be crucial for direct interaction with the active residues within cytochrome b. \n\nHowever, it might be essential to induce a correct docking pose within the Qo site, \n\nthrough hydrophobic interactions, as might occur with atovaquone. \n\n \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n36 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.2 LUMOs of atovaquone, clopidol and compounds 2.1-17. \n\n \n\n \n\nOn the other hand, analyzing HOMOs from Figure 2.3 and Table 2.2 one can see that: \n\n(E)-2.5 (E)-2.6 \n(Z)-2.4 \n\n(E)-2.7 (E)-2.8 \n\n(E)-2.9 (E)-2.10 \n(E)-2.11 \n\n(E)-2.12 \n2.13 \n\n2.17 \n(E)-2.14 (E)-2.15 (E)-2.16 \n\nClopidol \n\n2.1 2.2 2.3\n\nAtovaquone \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n37 \n\na) The energies are considerably lower for known bc1 complex inhibitors than for the other \n\nmolecules, except quaternary ammonium salt compounds which present higher values \n\nthan atovaquone, i.e. 2.2, 2.3, (E)-2.7 and (E)-2.8; \n\nb) HOMOs are located mainly at the aryl moiety, whereas in the charged molecules a more \n\nscattered pattern is shown, i. e. 2.2, 2.7 and 2.8. Further trends are less clear, though the \n\npattern observed for clopidol was reproduced by compound (E)-2.7; \n\nc) The introduction of electron-donors on the 4-pyridonimine moiety results in the increase \n\nof the HOMO and LUMO energies. \n\nThe HOMO-LUMO gap, i. e., the difference in energy between these two orbitals, is an \n\nimportant kinetic stability index [185]. In this study, the energy gap was always higher for clopidol \n\nthan for 4-pyridonimines, which suggests that these compounds are more reactive than clopidol. In \n\ncontrast, the energy gap of 4-pyridonimines is higher than that of atovaquone, with the exception of \n\ncompounds 2.9, 2.11 and 2.12.

In these colour-coded maps, regions given as red or orange \n\nrepresent areas with high electron density, whereas the blue areas represent electron-poor sites. It is \n\nalso noteworthy that these MEPs are not static, i.e. interaction of the ligand in the binding pocket \n\nmight change electron densities of both ligand and protein.  \n\nFor atovaquone, Figure 2.4, one can observe that the naphthoquinone moiety is highly electron-\n\nrich on the oxygen atom areas, which have been described as essential to establish a hydrogen-bond \n\nat the Qo site [58]. On the other hand, the most negative potential on clopidol and GW844520 is \n\nascribed to the oxygen and nitrogen atoms and, since the electron's distribution is rather different \n\nfrom that of atovaquone, it is expected that these might either interact differently or display a \n\ndifferent orientation from atovaquone in the binding pocket.  \n\nRegarding the 4-pyridonimines the following observations can be made: \n\n(E)-2.9 (E)-2.10 \n(E)-2.11 \n\n(E)-2.12 \n2.13 \n\n2.17\n(E)-2.14 (E)-2.15 (E)-2.16 \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n39 \n\na) Display either a straight or curled shape, and a very similar electrostatic potential pattern \n\nto the one observed for clopidol; \n\nb) The charge distribution pattern for these compounds suggests that the imine nitrogen \n\natoms may participate in electrostatic interactions or hydrogen bonds; \n\nc) Every molecule presents two distinct regions: the 4-pyridonimine, which accounts for \n\nmost of the slight differences observed between the molecules, due to the substitution \n\npattern, and the aryl moiety that displays a very identical electrostatic potential \n\ndistribution for every case, as long as it is not a quaternary ammonium salt, i.e. 2.2, 2.3, \n\n2.7 and 2.8; \n\nd) Generally, within the 4-pyridonimine moiety, the most negative potential is on the imine \n\nnitrogen, followed by the N1 nitrogen and, as expected, the heterocycle presents a neutral \n\nor positive electrostatic potential. This trend is most pronounced for those compounds \n\nthat have strong electron-withdrawing substituents, i.e. 2.9, 2.11, 2.12, and 2.14; \n\ne) Regarding the aryl moiety, the most negative electrostatic potentials are ascribed to the \n\nphenolic oxygen and the nitrogen from the diethylamino group, while the aromatic \n\nsystem is mostly given as neutral, except for quaternary ammonium salts. In the latter \n\ncase, the nitrogen from the diethylamino group presents a less negative or positive \n\npotential when compared to neutral molecules, which was expected, as a result of \n\nnitrogen quaternization, i.e. 2.2, 2.3, 2.7 and 2.8. \n\nSince all compounds showed the same electrostatic potential range, the 4-pyridonimines have, \n\ntheoretically, the capability to interact in the active site in a similar way to clopidol and GW844520, \n\nas a consequence of their MEP profile identity. A good qualitative correlation between the activity \n\nof compounds 2.1, 2.4, 2.6-2.8, Table 2.12, and the MEP profile was found. Charged molecules did \n\nnot show antiplasmodial activity and displayed a very distinct potential distribution to that of \n\nclopidol. Neutral molecules, on the other hand, displayed better activity, probably as a consequence \n\nof the better identity of all electron-derived parameters studied here. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.4 MEPs of atovaquone, clopidol, GW844520 and compounds 2.1-17. \n\nAtovaquone Clopidol \n\n2.1 2.2 \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n40 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.4 (cont.)

This poses the greatest challenge in modern structure-based drug \n\ndesign, and is mainly due to the difficulty to model, in a reliable way, the protein flexibility, rather \n\nthan ligand\u2019s flexibility  [188-190]. A number of docking programs are available, as well as search \n\nalgorithms which assess and rationalize the ligand-protein interactions [191]. \n\nGOLD (Genetic Optimisation for Ligand Docking) is a docking program that uses a genetic \n\nalgorithm to dock flexible ligands into binding sites [192]. Generally, it applies the concepts of \n\ngenetic evolution, with each docking solution being encoded as a chromosome. The chromosomes \n\nof a population, with all the information about hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic points, etc., are given \n\na score from the fitness to the binding site. These chromosomes are then ranked, in regard to their \n\nscores, and the fitter are iteratively optimized, through point mutations and cross-overs [191]. GOLD \n\noffers several scoring functions: GoldScore, ChemScore, ASP and an user defined score. GoldScore \n[193] is especially useful in predicting binding poses, and is composited by five components: protein-\n\nligand hydrogen bond energy, protein-ligand van der Waals energy, ligand internal van der Waals \n\nenergy, ligand torsional strain energy and ligand intramolecular hydrogen bond energy. ChemScore \n[194] is derived empirically from measured binding affinities and is best suited to estimate the total \n\nfree energy changes that occur from ligand binding. It has also been reported that GOLD, despite its \n\ngood prediction of binding poses, is binding site-dependent and is not as good when the binding is \n\npredominantly driven by hydrophobic interactions [195]. \n\nWith the aim of optimizing the Mannich-base compounds, a structure-based approach was \n\nfollowed to identify which substituents would better fit the binding pocket. This was carried out in a \n\nstepwise trial-error procedure. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n42 \n\n2.2.2 In silico cytochrome bc1 model validation \n\nCurrently there is no available crystal structure of the bc1 complex from P. falciparum, but a \n\nhomology model has been reported [20]. To circumvent the lack of crystallized structures of the bc1 \n\ncomplex from Plasmodium species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used as surrogate, due to \n\nthe high sequence identity between its cytochrome b and that of Plasmodium [58]. As a result, it has \n\nbeen successfully used to model in silico the binding mode of atovaquone to the Qo site, and to \n\nstudy cytochrome b mutations that confer resistance to atovaquone in Plasmodium and \n\nPneumocystis [58, 60].  \n\nThe bc1 complex co-crystallized with stigmatellin (PDB code: 1KYO [43]) was used for the \n\nmolecular docking studies. It contains the functional homodimer with the Rieske iron-sulfur protein \n\nin close contact with cytochrome b, that is, correctly oriented for electron transport. However, the \n\nrelatively low resolution of 2.97 \u00c5 makes it impossible to predict the position of crystallized waters. \n\nMore recently, the new structure 3C5X with a resolution of 1.90 \u00c5 [44] was published by the same \n\ngroup as 1KYO, and those waters were allocated. However, due to the total superimposition of the \n\ntwo PDB files and the added computational demand to perform docking runs with water molecules, \n\na simpler method without water molecules was kept, despite being reported that their presence \n\nresults in better predictions [196-198]. \n\nThe GoldScore and ChemScore algorithms were used in order to validate the docking model. \n\nBoth performed well, and the pose from the crystallized stigmatellin was reproduced with a RMSD \n\nbellow 1.5 \u00c5, Figure 2.5. This prediction was considered satisfactory as a RMSD of 2.0 \u00c5 is \n\ncommonly considered the cut-off for a good prediction [199]. Moreover, the major differences \n\nbetween the two molecules came from the weakly interacting side chain at the periphery of the \n\nbinding site. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5 Binding poses of stigmatellin.

The figure shows a highly negative binding \n\npocket which becomes less negative or neutral in the hydrophobic channel leading to the Qo centre. \n\nMoreover, a complementarity of the electrostatic potential between cytochrome bc1 and the ligands \n\nis highlighted with this study. The positive ring of the naphthoquinone moiety, binds deep into the \n\nQo site, where the electrostatic potential is most negative, Figure 2.6 A. Also, the hydroxyl group \n\ninteracts with the positive nitrogen of H181. Conversely, the hydrophobic side chain in atovaquone \n\nbinds to a near-neutral part of the active site, which might be important to generate an ideal docking \n\npose of the naphthoquinone moiety within the binding pocket. Thus, in addition to crucial hydrogen \n\nbonds with the E272 / H181 residues and hydrophobic contact [58], the electrostatic interactions \n\nmight be fundamental for a stabilized Qo-ligand complex. It is also possible to see that the hydroxyl \n\ngroup is within the distance for a hydrogen bond with H181, and the carbonyl oxygen atom at C4 of \n\nthe quinone system, is at 3.97 \u00c5 of the oxygen atoms of E272, which can accommodate a water-\n\nmediated hydrogen bond. These interactions are consistent with another model of the yeast bc1 \n\ncomplex with atovaquone bound in the Qo binding site and provide further support to the model [58]. \n\nThe docking results for compound 2.1, Figure 2.6 C (Appendix 1.2 for other compounds), \n\nsuggest a similar binding mode, with this scaffold complementing the most electronegative vicinity \n\nof the Qo site and the aminophenol side chain, described previously as having a close to neutral \n\nelectrostatic potential, stabilizing the protein-ligand complex through an hydrophobic interaction in \n\nthe pocket channel. \n\nModeling the interaction of clopidol with bc1 complex showed that the highest ranked binding \n\npose presented the carbonyl oxygen atom at 2.41 \u00c5 of E272, which is also consistent with a water-\n\nmediated hydrogen bond, Figure 2.6 B. In addition, there are only weak van der Waals interactions \n\nbetween the methyl and chlorine groups of clopidol with the active site residues. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n44 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.6 Docking poses of (A) atovaquone; (B) clopidol (two possibilities); and (C) 2.1.

Since it had \n\nbeen shown that the 4-pyridonimines displayed similar electronic properties to GW844520, a potent \n\nbc1 complex inhibitor, this compound was first docked into the Qo site, to understand the key \n\nbinding interactions that the new series of 4-pyridonimines would have to mimic, Figure 2.7.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.7 Binding mode of GW844520. \n\n \n\nB C A \n\nE272 \n\nH181 \n\n2.52 \u00c5 \n\nY132 \nY279\n\nL150\n\nE272 \n\nP271 \n\nT122 I299\n\nF151\n\nH181\n\nM29\nF129 \n\nF278\n\nL275 \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n45 \n\nDocking in the bc1 complex revealed that the top ranking solution presented the 4(1H)-pyridone \n\nmoiety within the binding site, and the side chain at C5 filling the hydrophobic channel. Enhanced \n\nvan der Waals contacts between the side chain and P271, Y279, L150, F151, L275, M295 and I299 \n\nwere observed, indicating that the bulk of the intermolecular interactions are essentially \n\nhydrophobic. Also, this compound occupied the whole extension of the binding site, maximizing \n\nthe hydrophobic contact with the bc1 complex. Despite the importance of the hydrophobic \n\ninteractions, it is likely that hydrogen bonds in GW844520 play a role in inhibition. For 2.1 it is not \n\npredicted a full interaction in the binding pocket, and the aryl moiety appears not to display an \n\noptimal orientation, Figure 2.6 C. Presumably those factors have affected the inhibitory potency of \n\nthis compound.  \n\nCompounds 2.18 and 2.19 were docked to understand if the pose of a quinoline-based \n\ncompound would improve the hydrophobic contact within the Qo site, Figure 2.8. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.8 Docking pose of (A) 2.18 and (B) 2.19. \n\nA \n\nE272 \n\nH181 \n\nM295 \n\nB \n\nE272 \n\nH181 \n\nM295 \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n46 \n\nCompound 2.18 displays a hydroxyl group on C5 to maximize binding interactions via \n\nhydrogen-bond to E272 residue (2.01 \u00c5) and is also within interaction distance of M295 (1.77 \u00c5). \n\nThough, the high torsional strain of the quinoline ring (GoldScore Sint = -16.43 for the best fit \n\nsolution) is responsible for the low fitness value, GoldScore = 44.47. On the other hand, the \n\namodiaquine derivative 2.19 does not display an ideal orientation in the binding pocket, and has an \n\neven lower GoldScore (42.43). Thus, quinoline molecules were discarded in this structure-base \n\ndesign approach, since their score was lower than that obtained for 2.1 (46.44). \n\nIn a second step of this approach, compounds 2.20-28 were tested, Table 2.4. \n\n \n\n \nTable 2.4 Structures and GoldScores of compounds 2.20-28. \n\n \nCompound R1 R2 R3 GoldScore \n\n2.20 H OH OPh-4-Cl 53.73 \n\n2.21 H OH SPh-4-Cl 60.87 \n\n2.22 H OH NHPh-4-Cl 49.74 \n\n2.23 H OH CH2Ph-4-Cl 57.06 \n\n2.24 H OH (CH2)2Ph-4-Cl 57.59 \n\n2.25 H OPh-4-Cl OH 49.39 \n\n2.26 H H (CH2)2Ph-4-Cl 61.59 \n\n2.27 2-NH2 OH (CH2)2Ph-4-Cl 54.88 \n\n2.28 2-NH2 H (CH2)2Ph-4-Cl 60.98 \n\n \n\n \n\nTo optimize the hydrophobic interaction, a second aromatic ring was introduced and several \n\nspacers were tested, i.e. 2.20-24. Moreover, chlorine was introduced at C4 of the terminal aryl to \n\nresemble atovaquone. From those compounds, 2.21 presented a better score, but the awkward pose \n\ninside the binding pocked, Figure 2.9 C, in addition to the possibility of metabolization into a \n\nsulfoxide, led to the rejection of that spacer in further optimizations. Compounds 2.20 and 2.22 \n\ndisplayed low GoldScore fitnesses (53.73 and 49.74, respectively) comparing to 2.23 and 2.24 \n\n(57.06 and 57.59, respectively) and were thus not optimized. However, as compound 2.23 is also \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n47 \n\nexpected to be labile, and readily metabolized into a ketone, 2.24 was chosen for further \n\noptimization. Therefore, for this type of compounds it was found that the double methylene spacer \n\nwas the most appropriate, as it led the inhibitor candidate to full occupancy of the active site, Figure \n\n2.9 E. Interestingly, GSK has recently released the structure of bc1 complex inhibitors displaying \n\nthe same side chain [200]. Furthermore, the hydroxyl group appeared to be important in establishing \n\ninteractions with the binding pocket, either with methionine or histidine residues. However, as the \n\n4-aminophenol moiety may metabolize into a quinoneimine, this set of compounds were also prone \n\nto such metabolization, and deplete the human host from glutathione. Thus, compound 2.25 was \n\ndocked in an isoquine-like approach, but without a good result. Next, compound 2.26 was docked \n\nand provided a very good score (61.59). This compound also allowed to conclude that the 4-\n\nhydroxyl group would not be essential for a good ligand-protein binding, as the score was higher \n\nthan for 2.24 (57.59). That was also observed when an amino group was introduced at C2 in the 4-\n\npyridonimine moiety, i.e. 2.27 vs. 2.28. That substituent was introduced to optimize the ligand \n\ninteraction with E272, but the best fit result predicted a better interaction with a methionine residue, \n\nFigure 2.9 H and I. Thus, as it could also compromise the synthesis of the target compounds, the \n\nintroduction of a hydrogen donor / acceptor at C2 was abandoned.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.9 Docking poses of (A) 2.20; (B) 2.21; (C) 2.22; (D) 2.23; (E) 2.24; (F) 2.25; (G) 2.26; (H) 2.27; (I) 2.28. \n\n \n\nC \n\nD \n\nE272 M295 \n\nM139 \n\nH181 \n\nE F \n\nE272 M295 \n\nM139 \n\nH181 \n\nE272 M295 \n\nM139 \n\nH181 \n\nA B\n\nE272 M295\n\nH181 \nM139\n\nE272 M295 \n\nM139 \n\nH181 \n\nE272 M295 \n\nM139 \n\nH181 \n\nC \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n48 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.9 (cont.)

A halogen was introduced at C3 to fit a \n\nsmall pocket in the active site and improved markedly the GoldScores, Table 2.5. In order to \n\nincrease the possibility of a hydrogen bond with critical aminoacid residues, hydroxymethyl and \n\nhydroxyl groups were tested. It was noted that a hydroxyl group at R5 could establish a hydrogen \n\nbond with H181, Figure 2.10 A-C, whereas a hydroxymethyl group could interact with E272, \n\nFigure 2.10 C and D, but the score did not increase, i.e. 2.31 vs. 2.32. Compound 2.33, with a 3-Br \n\nsubstituent, gave the best score (68.78). Moreover, two stilbene derivatives were tested, as they \n\nwould be intermediates in the synthetic pathway, but the rotation constraint given by the double \n\nbond did not favour fitting into the active site, i.e. 2.35 and 2.36, Figure 2.10 G and H. 2.37 \n\ndisplayed a very good GoldScore, but the introduction of a second halogen decreased the score, i.e. \n\n2.37 vs. 2.39. That should be ascribed to the different orientation of the molecules in the active site \n\nand a poorer hydrophobic interaction, Figure 2.10 K and L. The simple substitution of N-methyl for \n\nN-ethyl, i.e. 2.37 vs. 2.38, also benefited the fitness, as the resulting atom coordinates left the \n\nchlorine better accommodated. For 3,5-diCl compounds, 2.39 and 2.40, this trend was not observed \n\nas a result of a different binding pose. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nG H \nE272 M295 \n\nM139 \nH181 \n\nE272 M295 \n\nM139 \n\nH181 \n\nI\n\nE272 M295 \n\nM139 \n\nH181 \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n49 \n\nTable 2.5 Structures and GoldScores of compounds 2.29-40. \n\n \n\nCompound R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 GoldScore \n\n2.29 Cl H CH2OH 3-(CH2)2Ph-4-Cl OH 64.62 \n\n2.30 Cl H OH 3-(CH2)2Ph-4-Cl OH 61.30 \n\n2.31 Cl 6-CH2OH Et 4-(CH2)2Ph-4-Cl OH 62.59 \n\n2.32 Cl 6-CH2OH Et 3-(CH2)2Ph-4-Cl H 62.72 \n\n2.33 Br H Et 3-(CH2)2Ph-4-Cl H 68.78 \n\n2.34 Cl H Et 3-OPh-4-Cl H 61.71 \n\n2.35 Cl H Et 3-CHCHPh-4-Cl (Z) H 38.91 \n\n2.36 Cl H Et 3-CHCHPh-4-Cl (E) H 42.98 \n\n2.37 Cl H Me 3-(CH2)2Ph-4-Cl H 64.83 \n\n2.38 Cl H Et 3-(CH2)2Ph-4-Cl H 66.46 \n\n2.39 Cl 5-Cl Me 3-(CH2)2Ph-4-Cl H 62.65 \n\n2.40 Cl 5-Cl Et 3-(CH2)2Ph-4-Cl H 61.63 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.10 Docking poses of (A) 2.29; (B) 2.30; (C) 2.31; (D) 2.32; (E) 2.33; (F) 2.34; (G) 2.35; (H) 2.36; (I) 2.37; (J) \n\n2.38; (K) 2.39; (L) 2.40. \n\nA \n\nH181 \n\nE272 \nM295 \n\nM139 \n\nB \n\nE272 M295 \n\nH181 \nM139 \n\nC \nE272 \n\nM295 \n\nH181 \nM139 \n\nD \nE272 \n\nM295 \n\nH181 \nM139 \n\nF \nE272 \n\nM295 \n\nH181 \nM139 \n\nE \nE272 \n\nM295 \n\nH181 \nM139 \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n50 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.10 (cont.)

The inception of such compounds derived from a previous study on amodiaquine-like \n\nmolecules with potent antiplasmodial activity [172]. Therefore, in a first approach, the synthesized \n\ncompounds would also include the diethylaminophenol side chain. By conserving this side chain it \n\nwould be possible to assess the applicability of the 4-pyridonimine scaffold as antimalarial leads. It \n\nwould also allow concluding which substituents on the core scaffold would suit best against P. \n\nfalciparum. The retrosynthetic analysis for Mannich-base derivatives is given in Scheme 2.1. \n\n \nScheme 2.1 Retrosynthetic analysis for Mannich-base derivatives. \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n52 \n\n2.3.2 4-Pyridinamines \n\nThe synthetic pathway used for the obtention of the first series of compounds was already \n\ndescribed in the literature [201]. First, the Mannich-base formation was achieved from reaction of \n\nparacetamol, 2.46, with excess N,N-diethylamine and aqueous formaldehyde in ethanol, to give \n\nacetanilides 2.47 and 2.48, Scheme 2.2. The desired product 2.47 was isolated in higher yield when \n\nthe mixture was refluxed for 48 hours. Though, extending the reaction time from 24 to 48 hours \n\nresulted in the formation of small amounts of the bis-Mannich side-product, 2.48. Moreover, the \n\nyield of 2.47 decreased as the reaction was further extended from 48 to 72 hours. In contrast, the \n\nbis-Mannich product 2.48 was the only product isolated with a reaction time of 72 hours.  \n\nThe acid hydrolysis of 2.47 and 2.48 afforded the corresponding anilines 2.49 and 2.50 in near \n\nquantitative yields, which were used for the synthesis of compounds 2.51-58, Table 2.7 and Scheme \n\n2.2. Compounds 2.51-58 were obtained with yields, ranging from 11-89%. Compound 2.56 was \n\nobtained with 89% of theoretical mass, which can be explained with the electron withdrawing \n\nnature of the sulfonamide, favouring the aromatic nucleophilic substitution (SNAr).  \n\n \n\n \nScheme 2.2 Synthesis of pyridin-4-amines 2.51-58.

This resulted in an \n\nincrease of yield from 41% to 80%, Scheme 2.2 and Table 2.8. As can be seen from Table 2.8, \n\nincreasing the aminophenol / chloropyridine molar ration from 1 to 3 led to a significant increase in \n\nyield and reduction in the reaction time. \n\n \n\n \nTable 2.8 Reaction conditions for the SNAr reactions and synthesis of 2.59. \n\nMethod \nAminophenol \n\nmol. eq. \n\nPyridine \n\nmol. eq. \nReaction time \n\nFlash \n\nChromatography \nYield (%) \n\nA \n\nB \n\nC \n\n1.4 \n\n3 \n\n3 \n\n1 \n\n1 \n\n1 \n\nreflux/16 h \n\nreflux/2 h \n\nreflux/4.5 h \n\nCH2Cl2:MeOH (4:1) \n\nCH2Cl2:MeOH (4:1) \n\nCH2Cl2:MeOH (9:1) \n\n41 \n\n54 \n\n80 \n\n \n\n \n\nCompound 2.59 was also subjected to Mannich reaction and 2.51 was obtained in 65% yield. \n\nDespite the better overall yield and a shorter synthetic pathway, this was not the general approach \n\nfollowed because 2.47 and 2.49 could be synthesized in a very large scale, reducing the overall time \n\nconsumed. \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n54 \n\nAll 4-pyridinamines were characterized through common spectroscopic methods, including 1D \n\nand 2D NMR techniques, mass spectrometry and infra-red spectroscopy (IR). From inspection of \n\nthe 1H-NMR spectrum of 2.51, it is possible to see that protons at C2 are the most deshielded \n\nprotons, ? = 8.23 ppm, and appear as a doublet, 3J = 4.8 Hz. This is a common coupling constant \n\nbetween C2-H and C3-H for pyridines, and results from the sp2 hybridization of the nitrogen atom. \n\nOn the other hand, the proton at C3 is comparatively less deshielded, ? = 6.63 ppm. The remaining \n\nthree protons, from the aromatic moiety, can be found between ? 6.81 and ? 7.03 ppm, whereas the \n\namine proton is located at ? 5.83 ppm, as a broad singlet. Further inspection of the spectrum reveals \n\nthe aliphatic protons at higher field. Regarding the 13C-NMR spectrum, nine aromatic carbons were \n\nfound, five of which are CH, from DEPT analysis. HMQC was also performed and the CH carbons \n\nassigned on the basis of this spectrum. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.3 4-Pyridonimines \n\nFor the synthesis of compounds 2.1 and 2.4-8, distinct pathways were followed, taking into \n\naccount methods already described in the literature by Lopes et al. and Schock [172, 202]. These are \n\nschematized in Scheme 2.3. \n\nOne of the pathways consisted of synthesizing a quaternary ammonium salt, 2.62-69, from the \n\nstarting material, and proceed afterwards to the aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction with 4-\n\namino-2-(diethylaminomethyl)phenol. This is a logical pathway, since the C4 at the pyridinium salt \n\nis activated towards nucleophilic substitution. Several methods to synthesize compounds 2.62-69 \n\nwere attempted, but the chloro atom at C4 appears to deactivate N-alkylation because of its electron \n\nwithdrawing nature. Hence, the poor nucleophilic pyridinic nitrogen made the methylation of both \n\n4-chloro-3-pyridinesulfonamide and 4-chloro-3-nitropyridine impossible, which were further \n\ndeactivated by their C3 substituents. Another reason for the low reactivity was the poor solubility of \n\nthe stating materials. The only two pyridines that were efficiently alkylated through this pathway \n\nwere the ones that gave 2.62, 2.64 and 2.67, Table 2.9. The structural identification of pyridinium \n\nsalts was based on 1H-NMR, which showed a characteristic singlet at ? 4.2 ppm, assigned to N-CH3. \n\nGiven the difficulty of N-alkylation for this set of 4-chloropyridines, and the unanticipated failed \n\nreaction of 2.62, 2.64, 2.67 with 2.49, to give any of compounds 2.1 and 2.4-8, only the N-\n\nalkylation of 4-pyridinamines 2.51-56 was pursued, Scheme 2.3. \n\n \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n55 \n\n \nScheme 2.3 Synthetic pathway to compounds 2.1 and 2.4-8.

This had already been described by Lopes et al. [172], who had \n\nmade use of a strong base to deprotonate the substrate and increase the nucleophilicity of the \n\npyridinic nitrogen. In the present case, the resulting anion was then reacted with methyl iodide at \n\nroom temperature in a SN2 type reaction. The pKa values of the relevant functional groups within \n\n2.51-56 range between 18.7 and 20.2 for the aniline and is ca. 10.5 for the phenol [181, 203-208] which \n\nmade it difficult to predict the anion that formed first, while using NaH as a base. However, the \n\nabsence of reaction at the phenol reflects either (i) the steric hindrance exerted by the \n\ndiethylaminomethyl neighbouring group or, (ii) the preservation of an intramolecular hydrogen \n\nbond between the phenol and the dimethoxyaminomethyl moiety. The only exception was 2.56, \n\nwhich might be the result of a competing hydrogen bond between the phenol and the sulfonamide \n\nwith the nitrogen from the diethylaminomethyl group. It was also noted that changing the solvent \n\nfrom THF to DMF was crucial to obtain the required compounds in acceptable yields (Experimental \n\nSection for a full list of method variations). \n\n \n\n \nTable 2.10 Synthesis of compounds 2.1 and 2.4-8. \n\n \nCompound R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 Yield (%) \n\n2.1 H H H CH2NEt2 Me 59 \n\n2.4 H Me H CH2NEt2 Me 66 \n\n2.5 NH2 H H CH2NEt2 Me 0 \n\n2.6 Me H H CH2NEt2 Me 73 \n\n2.7 H Me H CH2N(Me)Et2\n+ I- Me 25 \n\n2.8 SO2NMe2 H Me CH2N(Me)Et2\n+ I- Me 36 \n\n \n\n \n\n In an attempt to make a sole methylation of 2.56 and understand its reactivity, the synthesis was \n\nrepeated varying the molar equivalents of both sodium hydride and methyl iodide. Given the high \n\npKa value of the NaH, and the inexistence of regioselectivity in the methylation reaction, several \n\nproducts were formed and an untractable mixture resulted, in reactions with less than three molar \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n57 \n\nequivalents of both reagents, Table 2.11. The most acidic hydrogen appeared to be either the \n\nphenolic or the sulfonamide\u2019s, since 2.70 and 2.71 were isolated, depending on the reaction \n\nconditions. This observation reinforced the possibility of a hydrogen bond competition, and is also \n\nin agreement with the predicted pKa values for the ionizable functions within 2.56 [181].  \n\nAs the molar equivalents were increased, more of compound 2.8 formed, and this was the only \n\ncompound isolated, from these starting materials, with the required 4-pyridonimine scaffold, Table \n\n2.11. It was also possible to observe that DMF is the solvent best suited for this reaction, due to a \n\nbetter dissolution of the 2.56 starting material. This set of reactions also showed that compound 2.8 \n\ncan be obtained in a clean reaction, when the base and alkylating agent are employed in great \n\nexcess. Also, a significant difference can be observed between the methods that use 6 and 6.7 molar \n\nequivalents of the reagents. Whereas in the first case 2.8 can only be obtained in 6% yield, in the \n\nsecond, its value is 6-fold higher. \n\n \n\n \nTable 2.11 Yields of the several species isolated from the alkylation of 2.56. \n\n \nReaction Conditions 2.8 2.70 2.71 \n\n(i) NaH, THF (1.2 mol eq.) \n\n(ii) MeI (2 mol eq.) \nN.I.

Compound 2.8 was also \n\ncharacterized through X-Ray crystallography. \n\n The 1H-NMR spectra of these compounds feature a common singlet at ca ? 3.9-4.1 ppm \n\nassigned to N-CH3. Further confirmation comes from the different coupling constants seen for the \n\n4-pyridinamine and the 4-pyridonimine moieties. In these compounds, the coupling constant \n\nincreases dramatically; 3J = 7.2 Hz for Ar-H2 in 2.1, whereas the 2.51 precursor has 3J = 4.8 Hz for \n\nAr-H2. This was already observed by Lopes et al [172] and reflects the change in the nitrogen \n\nhybridation [209]. Also, 2D NOESY confirmed the correlation between the Ar-H2 and the methyl \n\ngroup at the pyridyl nitrogen.  \n\nFor the quaternary ammonium salts 2.7 and 2.8, structural confirmation arrived from both \n\nCOSY and NOESY spectra. Coupling of the ? 1.45 ppm signal to the multiplet at ? 3.34-3.56 ppm, \n\nand the presence of a singlet at ? 3.00 ppm for 2.8 confirmed the existence of a pro-chiral centre. \n\nTherefore, the protons from the diethylamino methylene group are non-equivalent. Each of these \n\nprotons presents a doublet of quadruplets, due to geminal coupling (2J = 14.2 Hz) and vicinal \n\ncoupling (3J = 7.2 Hz). The singlet at ? 3.04 ppm corresponds to the two methyl groups of the \n\nsulfonamide, whereas the singlet at ? 4.59 ppm is assigned to the methylene between the aromatic \n\nring and the quaternary ammonium salt. These two protons are highly deshielded, because of the \n\npositive charge of the neighbouring amine, and the anisotropic effect exerted by the anisole ring. On \n\nthe other hand, 2D NOESY confirmed the correlation between the Ar-H2 and the methyl group at \n\nthe pyridyl nitrogen (? 4.10 ppm).  \n\nThis series of compounds underwent very extensive fragmentation when electronic impact (EI) \n\nwas used to obtain the spectra. Thus, fast atom bombardment (FAB) was preferred, as it is a \n\n\u201csofter\u201d ionization technique. Typically, the molecular ion itself is usually not seen, but an adduct \n\nion, such as [M+H]+, is prominent. The fragmentation pattern for the 4-pyridonimines is identical to \n\nthe one that was observed for the 4-pyridinamines. The fragment that results from breaking the \n\nbond between the isolated methylene group and the nitrogen from the diethylamino moiety yields \n\nthe most abundant ion, after the base peak, which is observed at m/z = [M+H]+. \n\nAs for the IR spectrum, a broad stretching vibration at ca. 3300 cm-1 is informative of the \n\npresence of a phenol group, just like in its precursors. In addition, the C=N linkage results in \n\nabsorption at ca. 1650 cm-1, as a consequence of stretching vibrations. \n\nUp to this point, there was spectroscopy data revealing the linkage of the methyl group to the \n\npyridinic nitrogen. However, since there was a step in the reaction that involved the formation of an \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n59 \n\nanion, it was not known whether the final reaction product consisted of a sole isomer, i.e. (Z) or (E), \n\nor a mixture of diastereomers. To assess the outcome of the reactions, compound 2.8 was slowly \n\ncrystallized from a mixture of water and acetone, affording crystals suitable for X-Ray analysis, \n\nwhich were analysed at the University of Santiago Compostela. \n\nFrom this study it was possible to see that only the (E) isomer of 2.8 was obtained, Appendix \n\n1.3. The same observation had been made in a study with amodiaquine analogues by Lopes et al. \n[172]. Also, there were two symmetry independent molecules, in the asymmetric unit, with no \n\nsignificant differences in bond lengths and angles. The observed imine bond distances C4-N14 and \n\nC44-N54 were longer than expected by ca. 0.035 \u00c5, as a consequence of the imine group being \n\nprotonated. This is consistant with imminium salts described elsewhere [210, 211]. The aromatic rings \n\nwere also not coplanar with the 4-pyridonimine groups, as was indicated by the C4-N14-C15-C16 \n\nand C44-N54-C55-C56 dihedral angles of 47.7(7)\u00ba and 132.6(5)\u00ba respectively. The molecules were \n\nhydrogen-bonded through the imine nitrogen atoms at N14 and N54, acting as donors towards the \n\nsulfonyl oxygen atoms O9 and O19 of their respective sulfonamide moieties. Furthermore, the 4-\n\npyridonimine scaffold was nearly planar, and the C5-C4-N14-C15 dihedral angle was 7.9(7)\u00ba for \n\none of the molecules, whereas the C43-C44-N54-C55 dihedral angle on the other molecule was -\n\n14.1(7)\u00ba, Figure 2.12. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.12 ORTEP view of the molecular structure of 2.8, showing the labelling of all non-hydrogen atoms. \n\nDisplacement ellipsoids for non-hydrogen atoms are shown at the 50% probability level.

The following trends on the \n\nSAR were observed: \n\na) Derivative 2.1 presented IC50 values of 8.6 and 7.9 ?M against the W2 and FCR3 strains, \n\nrespectively, that are close to those of clopidol, 9.7 and 3.4 ?M, respectively;  \n\nb) Incorporation of a methyl group at C3 of the 4-pyridonimine moiety, i.e. 2.6, led to a \n\nsignificant decrease in antiplasmodial activity when compared to the parent 2.1. \n\nHowever, a methyl group at C2, i.e. 2.4, led to a decrease in activity against the W2 \n\nstrain, but not against the FCR3 strain; \n\nc) Compounds with cationic side chains, i.e. 2.7 and 2.8, were inactive against the W2 \n\nstrain, but were more active against the FCR3 strain. \n\n \n\n \nTable 2.12 Antiplasmodial activity of 4-pyridonimines containing a Mannich-base side chain, 2.1, 2.4 and 2.6-8. \n\n \n\nIC50 (?M) \nCompd R1 R2 R3 R4 \n\nW2  FCR3  \n\n2.1 H H H CH2NEt2 8.61 \u00b1 0.41 7.90 \u00b1 0.24 \n\n2.4 H Me H CH2NEt2 20.7 \u00b1 1.7 8.09 \u00b1 0.44 \n\n2.6 Me H H CH2NEt2 33.0 \u00b1 0.7 > 10 \n\n2.7 H Me H CH2N(Me)Et2\n+ I- > 50 9.86 \u00b1 0.28 \n\n2.8 SO2NMe2 H Me CH2N(Me)Et2\n+ I- > 50 > 10 \n\nClopidol     9.73 \u00b1 0.07 3.37 \u00b1 0.19 \n\nAtovaquone     0.0012 1.89 \u00b1 0.10 \n\nCloroquine     0.052 0.051 \n\nGW844520     0.030 a  \naT9-96 strain [19]. \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n61 \n\nIt is also noteworthy that the antiplasmodial activity might be related, at least in part, to the \n\ninhibition of heme polymerization, since these compounds are associated to amodiaquine [213]. \n\nThese compounds were also tested against the PfNDH2 complex at the Liverpool School of \n\nTropical Medicine, but showed no inhibitory activity. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.4 Rationale for structure-based 4-pyridonimines \n\nThe docking studies that were presented revealed that the best potential antiplasmodial \n\ncompounds would feature two aryl moieties spaced by two methylene groups, with the terminal \n\nphenyl harbouring an electron-withdrawing group. In Scheme 2.4 the retrosynthetic analysis of \n\nthose 4-pyridonimines is presented. These compounds can be obtained through alkylation of the \n\ncorresponding 4-pyridinamines, as was presented for the Mannich-base series (A). Alternatively, N-\n\nalkylation of 4-chloropyridines can precede and activate SNAr (B). In both cases anilines can be \n\nobtained from the reduction of nitrostilbenes, which are in turn synthesized through Wittig \n\nchemistry.  \n\n \n\n \nScheme 2.4 Retrosynthetic analysis of target 4-pyridonimines. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.5 Intermediates for structure-base 4-pyridonimines \n\n \nNitrostilbenes \n\nNitrostilbenes were synthesized via Wittig chemistry, using appropriate aldehydes and \n\nphosphonium salts.

The yields ranged from moderate to excellent, when chlorine and \n\nbromine were the leaving groups, respectively, after reacting for the same period of time, Table \n\n2.13. These intermediates were easily identified by 1H-NMR spectroscopy as a characteristic \n\ndoublet at ca. ? 5.5-6.0 ppm with a high coupling constant, ca. 2J = 14-15 Hz was identified. This \n\nshows the presence of a C-P bond. The 31P-NMR spectrum showed a singlet at ca. ? 20 ppm. \n\n \n\n \nScheme 2.5 Synthetic pathway to compounds 2.72-80.

Additionally, \n\na mixture of (E) and (Z) isomers was formed with predominance on the (E) isomer, which is \n\nconsistent with what had already been described [215, 216]. In fact, as the reaction time increased, \n\nfrom 3 to 7 refluxing hours, more (E) isomer was formed, entry 5 vs. 3. Moreover, no influence on \n\nthe yield was observed when 1.0 molar equivalents of benzaldehyde was used instead of 1.25, entry \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n63 \n\n3 vs. 4, respectively. The synthesis of 2.82 through method A yielded a higher percentage of the (Z) \n\nisomer, entry 9, which was not expected [214], whereas 2.83 was only obtained using milder \n\nconditions but with a Z/E ratio of 0.5, entry 14. \n\n \n\n \nScheme 2.6 Synthetic pathway of compounds 2.81-104. Reagents and conditions: (i) a) dry benzene, n-BuLi, N2, b) \n\naldehyde, rt or reflux; (ii) NaOH, CH2Cl2, aldehyde, rt; (iii) NaOH, CH2Cl2, aldehyde, MW. \n\n \n\n \n\nAs method A was not an efficient pathway to synthesize all the required stilbenes, the efforts \n\nwere turned onto the phase transfer catalysis procedure, which made use of NaOH and CH2Cl2 as \n\nsolvents, and the phosphonium salt as a \u2018catalyst\u2019 (methods B and B\u2019). PTC Wittig reactions proved \n\nto be more efficient, given that higher yields were achieved in all cases, under milder conditions and \n\nlower reaction times.  \n\nUsing 2.72 as a starting material (method B), compound 2.81 was synthesized in excellent yield, \n\nand a high Z/E ratio was observed, entry 6. For compounds 2.82 and 2.83, this procedure yielded \n\nthem in 98%, entry 11, and 93%, entry 15, respectively, underpinning that the reaction is equally \n\nefficient with electron-withdrawing and donating groups on the aldehyde starting material. The Z/E \n\nratios were also over 2.30 in both cases and showed no dependence on the substitution pattern of \n\nthe aldehyde moiety. Though, when the benzyltriphenylphosphonium salt was left reacting with 3-\n\nnitrobenzaldehyde (method B\u2019) for approximately 2 hours, not only 2.81 was obtained in a lower \n\nyield, but the Z/E ratio increased, entry 8 vs. 6. This was expected, as the interchange of substituents \n\nbetween the phosphonium salt and the aldehyde, especially nitro groups, has been connected with \n\nsomewhat drastic changes in both the yield and Z/E ratio of the reaction [217]. For 2.83, this \n\nphosphonium salt inversion gave nearly the same outcome when allowed to react for 2 hours, both \n\nin terms of yield and product ratio, entry 15 vs. 17. \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n64 \n\nTable 2.14 Comparison of Wittig reaction methods, to acquire 2.81-83. \n\n \nEntry Compd R2 Methoda Time (h) Yield (%) Z:E (ratio)b \n\n1 2.81 H A 4, rt 0 - \n\n2 2.81 H A 25, rt 31 42:58 (0.72) \n\n3 2.81 H A 7, reflux 67 34:66 (0.52) \n\n4 2.81 H A 7, reflux 68 40:60 (0.67) \n\n5 2.81 H A 3, reflux 56 42:58 (0.72) \n\n6 2.81 H B 2, rt 92 84:16 (5.25) \n\n7 2.81 H B\u2019 0.7, rt 74 75:25 (3.00) \n\n8 2.81 H B\u2019 2, rt 89 85:15 (5.67) \n\n9 2.82 OMe A 6, reflux 20 62:38 (1.63) \n\n10 2.82 OMe B 0.5, rt 89 71:29 (2.45) \n\n11 2.82 OMe B 2, rt 98 77:23 (3.35) \n\n12 2.82 OMe B\u2019 2, rt 92 67:33 (2.00) \n\n13 2.83 Cl A 7, reflux 0 - \n\n14 2.83 Cl A 7, rt 24 33:67 (0.50) \n\n15 2.83 Cl B 2, rt 93 70:30 (2.33) \n\n16 2.83 Cl B\u2019 0.5, rt 92 69:31 (2.22) \n\n17 2.83 Cl B\u2019 2, rt 94 71:29 (2.45) \na Method A uses anhydrous conditions.

It can be seen that the \n\nstereoselectivity depends significantly on the position of the nitro group in the phosphonium halide, \n\nTable 2.15. A high (Z) stereoselectivity was observed for the reaction of 3- and 3,5-\n\ndinitrobenzylphosphonium salts with benzaldehyde, entries 1 and 7.  In contrast, placement of the \n\nnitro group in the ortho or para positions of the phosphonium salt led to a significant increase in the \n\nproportion of the (E) alkene and loss of stereoselectivity, entries 4, 5 and 6. The diastereomeric ratio \n\nobtained for 2.85 is identical to the one reported for the synthesis of 2-nitro-2\u2019,5\u2019-dimethylstilbene, \n\nZ:E = 1.4 [217], which was obtained through the same benzyltriphenyl phosphonium salt and \n\nidentical conditions. Finally, the reaction of 2,4-dinitrobenzylphosphonium chloride with \n\nbenzaldehyde shifted the stereoselectivity towards the formation of the (E)-2.84, entry 4. \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n65 \n\nTable 2.15 Reaction of nitro-substituted benzyltriphenyl phosphonium salts with aldehydes under standard PTC \n\nconditions at room temperature (Method B) and microwave-assisted synthesis (Method C). \n\n \nMethod B Method C \n\nCpd R1 R2 \nEntry \n\nYield \n\n(%)a \nZ:E (ratio)b Entry \n\nYield \n\n(%)a \nZ:E (ratio)b \n\n2.81 3-NO2 H 1 92 84:16 (5.25) 1\u2019 84 73:27 (2.70) \n\n2.82 3-NO2 4-OMe 2 98 77:23 (3.35) 2\u2019 79 77:23 (3.33) \n\n2.83 3-NO2 4-Cl 3 93 70:30 (2.33) 3\u2019 96 70:30 (2.38) \n\n2.84 2,4-diNO2 H 4 34 17:83 (0.20) 4\u2019 N.D.\nc N.D.c \n\n2.85 2-NO2 H 5 95 57:43 (1.33) 5\u2019 24 69:31 (2.22) \n\n2.86 4-NO2 H 6 88 58:42 (1.38) 6\u2019 93 34:66 (0.52) \n\n2.87 3,5-diNO2 H 7 76 88:12 (7.33) 7\u2019 67 71:29 (2.45) \n\n2.88 3-NO2 2-F 8 96 91:9 (10.11) 8\u2019 49 86:14 (6.14) \n\n2.89 3-NO2 2-Cl 9 100 85:15 (5.67) 9\u2019 46 83:17 (4.88) \n\n2.90 2-NO2 2-F 10 90 83:17 (4.88) 10\u2019 88 76:24 (3.17) \n\n2.91d 2-NO2 2-CO2Me 11 47 78:22 (3.54) 11\u2019 39 63:37 (1.70) \n\n2.92 4-NO2 2-F 12 100 58:42 (1.37) 12\u2019 77 74:26 (2.85) \n\n2.93 4-NO2 2-Cl 13 92 67:33 (2.00) 13\u2019 96 80:20 (4.00) \n\n2.94 3-NO2 4-NO2 14 61 100:0 14\u2019 N.D.

Indeed, the equilibrium acidities, \n\npKHA in DMSO, of 4-substituted ArCH2PPh3+ cations correlate with the Hammett ?- constants of \n\nthe substituents in the aryl moiety with a slope of -4.78, reflecting the direct conjugation of the \n\nnegative in the conjugate base, the ylide, with electron withdrawing groups such as NO2 [218]. The \n\nsimilar Z:E ratios for 2.85 and 2.86, Table 2.15 entries 5 and 6, suggest that stereoselectivity is not \n\naffected by sterical hindrance in the ylide moiety.  \n\nStilbenes 2.88-94 were obtained in good yields, entries 8-14. Although diastereoselection was \n\nvariable, the (Z) isomer was predominant in all cases. Interestingly the reaction diasterioselectivity \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n66 \n\ndecreased with the introduction of both moderate electron withdrawing and donating groups in the \n\naldehyde, i.e. 2.82 and 2.83, in comparison to the non-substituted counterpart, but the introduction \n\nof 4-NO2 resulted in the (Z) isomer, exclusively, under these reaction conditions, entry 14. For \n\nreactions with 2-halobenzaldehydes, the expected (Z) diastereoselectivity was observed even for the \n\nstabilized 2-nitro ylide. The cooperative ortho halo effect [219, 220] may be responsible for these \n\nresults and overrides the stabilizing effect of resonance to the nitro group.  \n\nWith these results in hand, it was studied the effect of the microwaves in the synthesis of 2.81, \n\nat different temperatures, Table 2.16. Interestingly, the conversion rate decreased with higher \n\ntemperatures, methods C-F. Also, the stereocontrol was poorer when compared to the reaction \n\nwithout microwaves. Since the microwave-assisted protocol was most successful at 30 \u00baC, the \n\nreactions to acquire the remaining stilbenes were carried out at this temperature.  \n\n \n\n \nTable 2.16 Comparative study, rt vs. MW, for the synthesis of 2.81. \n\nMethod Temperature Time Yield (%) Z:E (ratio) \n\nB:  PTC rt 2 h 92 84:16 (5.25) \n\nC:  PTC/MW/100W 30 3 min 84 73:27 (2.70) \n\nD:  PTC/MW/100W 50 3 min 88 71:29 (2.45) \n\nE:  PTC/MW/100W 70 3 min 70 69:31 (2.23) \n\nF:  PTC/MW/100W 90 3 min 64 68:32 (2.13) \n\n \n\n \n\nAs for the microwave-assisted reactions, the yields were less consistent and resulted in a \n\ndecrease of the (Z) stereoselectivity, e.g. Table 2.15 entries 7 vs. 7\u2019. With the stabilized 4-\n\nnitrophosphorane the reaction rate increased and inversion on the stereoselectivity was observed, \n\nentries 6 vs. 6\u2019, whereas with 2,4-dinitrophosphorane an untractable mixture was obtained, entry 4\u2019.   \n\nVariation of the substitution pattern in the aldehyde did not affect significantly the PTC reaction \n\nyield, except for 2.85, 2.88 and 2.89, entries 5/5\u2019, 8/8\u2019 and 9/9\u2019, and although diastereoselection was \n\nvariable, the (Z) isomer was generally predominant. For reactions with 2-halobenzaldehydes, the \n\nexpected (Z) diastereoselectivity was observed, but the co-operative ortho halo effect was not as \n\npronounced when compared to method A of PTC reactions. Interestingly, reactions under \n\nmicrowaves with 4-nitrophosphorane afforded a greater (Z) selectivity than the standard PTC \n\nprocedure, entries 12/12\u2019 and 13/13\u2019. However, despite the lower yields and poorer \n\ndiastereoselection, this procedure greatly reduces the reaction time. \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n67 \n\nTable 2.17 Synthesis of alkenes 2.96-99 through Wittig chemistry. \n\n \nMethod B Method C \n\nCpd Z \nEntry \n\nYield \n\n(%)a \nZ:E (ratio)b Entry \n\nYield \n\n(%)a \nZ:E (ratio)b \n\n2.96 \n \n\n1 45 80:20 (4.00) 1\u2019 55 79:21 (3.76) \n\n2.97 \n \n\n2 N.D.c N.D.c 2\u2019 N.D.c N.D.c \n\n2.98  3 N.D.\nc N.D.c 3\u2019 N.D.c N.D.c \n\n2.99 d \n \n\n4 84 17:83 (0.20) 4\u2019 N.D.

Moreover, 3-nitrotoluene was the main \n\nproduct when the reactions were carried out with aliphatic aldehydes, and the main cause of lower \n\nyields for MW-assisted reactions. Instability of stabilized phosphoranes has already been reported \n\nwhilst using microwave assisted synthesis [221] and the hydrolysis of phosphonium salts correlates \n\nwith the Hammet ? values of 3-NO2 and 4-NO2. The rate limiting step in the mechanism is variable, \n\nbut involves the attack of a hydroxide to the phosphorous, and formation of phosphine oxide. This \n\nstep also results in expulsion of the benzylic carbanion, which in aqueous solution affords the \n\ncorresponding toluene [222]. Finally, compounds 2.101 and 2.102 were obtained via method B\u2019, \n\nTable 2.18. \n\nThese intermediates were isolated in Z:E mixtures and identified by 1H-NMR spectroscopy.

Typically, the reactions were completed after 15-30 minutes (TLC). The \n\nreduction of 2.83 at room temperature afforded only ca. 1/3 of 2.105 and ca. 2/3 of 2.103. This was \n\nalready expected as there is halogen removal reported when using TES as an in situ H2 generator \n[224]. Thus, the synthesis of 2.105 was attempted below room temperature. At -10 \u00baC an equal \n\namount of 2.105 and 2.103 was obtained, but at -65 \u00baC only the desired product was formed. In this \n\ncase, the reaction was allowed to develop for 3 hours before quenching, to avoid halogen \n\nsubstitution; hence the lower yield, comparing to other reactions. \n\nThese intermediates were identified by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. These series of \n\nintermediates is readily identified from the characteristic simetric multiplet at ca. ? 2.7-3.0 ppm that \n\ncorresponds to the two methylene groups spacing the aryl moieties. A simple triplet pattern for each \n\nmethylene would be expected, but a closer inspection of the signal allows one to see seven peaks, \n\nwhich is only consistent with ddd coupling, i.e. all protons are non-equivalent. This would yield \n\neight distinct peaks, but the rather low resolution of the spectrum does not permit the determination \n\nof the coupling constants. \n\n \n\n \n\nPyridinamines \n\nWith the synthesized anilines, SNAr was carried out with 3,4-dichloropyridine in order to afford \n\n4-pyridinamines, Scheme 2.4 A.

[225]. N-alkylation with methyl and ethyl iodide upon deactivated pyridines \n\nhad previously failed, and thus, a stronger alkylating agent was employed, i.e. methyl or ethyl \n\ntriflate, Scheme 2.9. All compounds precipitated from the reaction mixture, and were obtained in \n\nexcellent yields. The exception was observed for the 3-nitropyridine which did not react in these \n\nconditions, Table 2.21. The compounds were identified by 1H-NMR spectroscopy and presented a \n\ncharacteristic peak at ca. ? 4.5 ppm, assigned to the methyl or methylene protons linked to pyridine. \n\n \n\n \n Scheme 2.9 Synthetic pathway to compounds 2.113-118.

The 4-chloropyridines were transformed into the corresponding \n\n4(1H)-pyridones, before undertaking the alkylation step. 3-Nitropyridone was prepared from a \n\nsimple reaction with NaOH, under reflux, affording 2.119 in quantitative yield, Scheme 2.10. \n\nHowever, the attempted synthesis of the N-ethyl derivative of 2.119, i.e. 2.120, was also not \n\nsuccessful. \n\n \n\n \nScheme 2.10 Synthetic pathway to compound 2.119. Reagents and conditions: (i) NaOH, reflux; (ii) toluene, EtOTf, \n\nTEA, rt. \n\n \n\n \n\nOn the other hand, compound 2.121 was obtained in quantitative yield from deprotection of 4-\n\nmethoxypyridine with trimethylsilyl iodide (TMSI), Scheme 2.11 [226]. This pyridone gave access to \n\nthe introduction of bromine at C3, 2.122, from reaction with NBS, which would be a key \n\nintermediate to synthesize the compounds with the highest docking scores. Though, the low yield of \n\nthe bromination step (19%) made it unsuitable to progress further with the synthesis of its 4-chloro \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n72 \n\nderivative with POCl3.

It was noted that for the Mannich-base derivatives, alkylation \n\noccurred only at the pyridinic nitrogen, but for this series, alkylation occurred, remarkably, only at \n\nthe amine nitrogen, Scheme 2.12. \n\n \n\n \nScheme 2.12 Synthetic pathway for compound 2.123. Reagents and conditions: (i) a) DMF, NaH b) EtI. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe structure of 2.123 was confirmed by NMR techniques and the signal given by CH2CH3 was \n\nsignificantly different from what had been observed for the first series. Whereas the N-CH3 protons \n\nof 2.1, 2.4 and 2.6-8 appear at ca. ? 4.0 ppm, for this synthesis the N-CH2 protons were obtained at \n\na higher field, ? 3.83 ppm. Furthermore, the coupling constant of Ar-H2 and Ar-H3 remained at ca. \n3J = 4.5 Hz, which is not consistent with the 4-pyridonimine core. The final confirmation came \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n73 \n\nfrom 2D NOESY spectrum, in which no correlation of the methylene with Ar-H2 was seen, Figure \n\n2.13. For this reason, this pathway was abandoned for the remaining synthesis. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.13 2D NOESY spectrum of 2.123. \n\n \n\n \n\nVia pyridinium salts \n\nThe SNAr was carried out for 20-24 hours under reflux in the presence of triethylamine and in \n\nethanol. The 4-pyridonimine derivatives 2.124-137 were obtained through an addition-elimination \n\nmechanism [228], in good yields, and isolated as trifluoromethanesulfonates or hydroiodides, \n\ndepending on the counterion of the pyridinium starting material, Scheme 2.13 and Table 2.22. \n\n \n\n \nScheme 2.13 Synthetic pathway to compound 2.124-137.

Two \n\ndifferent pathways were experimented, Scheme 2.14. First, N-oxidation of pyridine was carried out \n\nwith mCPBA affording the desired N-oxide 2.139 in good yield (73%). An attempted SNAr with the \n\nN-oxide followed, but no reaction was observed, probably due to the higher electron density at C4, \n\nas a consequence of the electron-donor effect from N-O-. This was also confirmed from the 1H-\n\nNMR spectrum of 2.139. The C2 protons are more shielded than in the starting material as a result \n\nof the resonance of the oxygen atom with the aromatic moiety. Greater difficulty to perform SNAr \n\nreactions with N-oxides than with N-alkyl salts had been reported [228]. \n\nAlternatively, N-oxidation of the previously synthesized 4-pyridinamine 2.111 was carried out \n\nwith success, affording 2.138 in 31% yield. \n\n \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n75 \n\n \nScheme 2.14 Synthetic pathway to compound 2.138. Reagents and conditions: (i) CHCl3, mCPBA, reflux (ii) EtOH, \n\nTEA, aniline, reflux. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe compounds were characterized with several spectroscopic techniques, including 1D and 2D \n\nNMR and only the (E) isomer was formed. A characteristic feature of these compounds is the \n\nresonance of the N-CHx group at ca. ? 4.0-4.3 ppm, presenting an upfield shift compared to the salt \n\nprecursor. Additionally, the Ar-H2 and Ar-H3 resonances and their vicinal coupling constants \n\nprovide further evidence of contrasting electronic features to those of the starting material: (i) Ar-\n\nH2 resonance appears dramatically more shielded, ca. ? 8.0-8.8 ppm (3J of 7.2 to 7.6 Hz), than the \n\npiridinium salt which appears at ca. ? 9.0-9.5 ppm (3J = 6.8 Hz); (ii) higher coupling constants \n\nindicate the shift in nitrogen hybridation from sp2 to sp3 as was also observed for the first series. As \n\nan example, the 1H-NMR spectrum of 2.129 presents Ar-H2 at ? = 8.74 ppm, and Ar-H6 at ? = 8.18 \n\nppm, whereas Ar-H5 is found at ? = 6.88 ppm, the most shielded proton in the aromatic region. The \n\nspectrum also shows an AA\u2019 BB\u2019 system, ? = 7.38 and 7.56 ppm, corresponding to the terminal aryl \n\nmoiety. At higher fields, one finds the chemical shifts of the ethyl group, and the methylene spacer \n\nas a broad singlet-like multiplet, ? 3.07 ppm. \n\nMass spectroscopy was carried out on electrospray ionization, positive mode. The base peak \n\nwas obtained for [M+H]+, for this series of compounds. Furthermore, the peak with m/z = 246 at a \n\nrelative abundance of ca. 80% results from the fragmentation at the methylene linker. This was the \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n76 \n\nmost common breaking point among the synthesized compounds, and was identical to the Mannich-\n\nbase series, Figure 2.14. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.14 Fragmentation pattern for 4-pyridonimines, exemplified by 2.129. \n\n \n\n \n\nAntiplasmodial activity and cytotoxicity \n\nWith the introduction of a second aryl moiety, a lipophilic spacer in the structure-base designed \n\n4-pyridonimines, and a chlorine atom at C3, it was expected that the antiplasmodial activities would \n\nimprove, compared to the Mannich-base series. In fact, the IC50s against the W2 strain dropped, at \n\nleast, 1.5-fold, pinpointing the successful use of the docking model to design new inhibitors. \n\nAnalysis of Table 2.23 allows the following observations on SAR: \n\na) Introduction of a lipophilic side chain improved the antiplasmodial activity to a maximum \n\nof 9-fold, i.e. 2.1 vs. 2.131; \n\nb) Exchange of the N-methyl for a N-ethyl group at R3 generally resulted in little effect on \n\nthe antiplasmodial activity against the W2 and FCR3 strains, i.e. 2.126 vs. 2.127, and \n\n2.132 vs. 2.133; \n\nc) For the 3-Cl series, the 4-OCF3 substituent at the terminal aromatic ring increased activity \n\nagainst the W2 and FCR3 strains, when compared to the unsubstituted counterpart, i.e. \n\n2.126 vs. 2.130; \n\nd) The substituent effect on both strains was 4-OCF3 (2.130) > 4-CF3 (2.129) > 4-Cl (2.128) \n\n> H (2.126) ? 4-OMe (2.124), which is similar to what had been reported for 4(1H)-\n\npyridones [19]; \n\ne) For the 3-NH2 subset, the 4-OCF4 substituent at R4 had a detrimental effect on the \n\nantiplasmodial activity, for the W2 strain, which is also consistent with the drop of \n\nactivity for 4(1H)-pyridones with electron-donating groups at C3 [19]; \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n77 \n\nf) Introduction of a second chlorine atom at C5 does not have a significant impact on \n\nactivity, against the W2 strain, i.e. 2.130 vs. 2.131; \n\ng) The N-hydroxy derivative 2.138 was inactive against both tested strains, in line with the \n\nSAR described for clopidol analogues [19]; \n\nh) The position of the phenethyl side chain also had effect on the antiplasmodial activity, \n\nwith the 2\u2019 and 4\u2019 isomers being less active than their 3\u2019 counterpart, against the W2 \n\nstrain, i.e. 2.135 and 2.136 vs. 2.126; \n\ni) The 3-phenylpropyl side chain resulted in increased activity, which is indicative of the \n\nimportance of a lipophilic side chain, i.e. 2.126 vs. 2.137; \n\nj) The antiplasmodial activities against the W2 and FCR3 strains are comparable, given the \n\nsame point mutation on the gene that confers chloroquine resistance. The compound \n\n2.136 is at least 3-fold more active against the FCR3 strain. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n78 \n\nTable 2.23 Antiplasmodial activity against P. falciparum W2 and FCR3 strains. \n\n \nIC50 (?M) \u00b1 SD \n\nCompound R1 R2 R3 R4 Isomer n \nW2 FCR3 \n\n2.1       8.61 \u00b1 0.41 7.90 \u00b1 0.24 \n\n2.124 Cl H Et OMe 3\u2019 1 3.44 \u00b1 0.08 3.95 \u00b1 0.93 \n\n2.125 Cl H Me OMe 3\u2019 1 5.24 \u00b1 0.68 5.12 \u00b1 1.61 \n\n2.126 Cl H Et H 3\u2019 1 3.46 \u00b1 0.28 3.53 \u00b1 0.29 \n\n2.127 Cl H Me H 3\u2019 1 4.75 \u00b1 0.78 2.89 \u00b1 0.89 \n\n2.128 Cl H Et Cl 3\u2019 1 3.24 \u00b1 0.24 2.17 \u00b1 0.33 \n\n2.129 Cl H Et CF3 3\u2019 1 1.60 \u00b1 0.15 1.87 \u00b1 0.33 \n\n2.130 Cl H Et OCF3 3\u2019 1 1.07 \u00b1 0.07 1.70 \u00b1 0.20 \n\n2.131 Cl Cl Et OCF3 3\u2019 1 0.94 \u00b1 0.12 2.80 \u00b1 0.03 \n\n2.132 NH2 H Et H 3\u2019 1 1.67 \u00b1 0.15 2.08 \u00b1 0.95 \n\n2.133 NH2 H Me H 3\u2019 1 1.47 \u00b1 0.10 2.21 \u00b1 0.22 \n\n2.134 NH2 H Et OCF3 3\u2019 1 3.91 \u00b1 0.03 1.83 \u00b1 1.27 \n\n2.135 Cl H Et H 2\u2019 1 6.67 \u00b1 0.38 3.19 \u00b1 0.90 \n\n2.136 Cl H Et H 4\u2019 1 > 10 3.74 \u00b1 0.12 \n\n2.137 Cl H Et H 3\u2019 2 2.43 \u00b1 0.10 2.25 \u00b1 1.12 \n\n2.138a Cl H OH H 3\u2019 1 > 8.9 > 8.9 \n\nClopidol       9.73 \u00b1 0.07 3.37 \u00b1 0.19 \n\nAtovaquone       0.0012 1.89 \u00b1 0.10 \n\nChloroquine       0.052 0.051 \na Compound 2.138 was obtained in the neutral form. \n\n \n\n \n\nMolecular docking \n\nFinally, to understand how the two most active compounds would interact with the predicted \n\nbinding site, a docking study was carried out in their iminium form, since they had been tested as \n\ntriflates.  Compound 2.130, Figure 2.15 B, presents the side chain occupying the hydrophobic \n\nchannel leading to the Qo centre, and interacts with aliphatic and aromatic side chains of L150, \n\nF151, L275, F278, M295, I299 which is similar to GW844520, Figure 2.15 A. Interestingly, the \n\niminium hydrogen atom of 2.130 is close to the nitrogen atom of H181 (2.8 \u00c5) which is compatible \n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n79 \n\nwith a hydrogen bond. On the other hand, 2.131 presents an identical docking pose to 2.130, where \n\nthe side chain is occupying the hydrophobic channel. The iminium hydrogen atom of 2.131 is 4.2 \u00c5 \n\naway from the oxygen atom of E272, which is compatible with a water-mediated hydrogen bond. \n\nThese results support the hypothesis that 4-pyridonimines can bind to the Qo site in cytochrome b, \n\npromoting interactions with the residues that define the hydrophobic channel in a similar way to \n\nGW844520. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.15 Docking poses of (A) clopidol (purple), and GW844520 (blue); (B) 2.130 (purple), and 2.131 (blue). \n\n \n\n \n\nAnti-liver activity and cytotoxicity \n\nCompounds 2.124-138 were also tested for their activity against the liver stages of P. berghei in \n\nhuman hepatoma cells.

In short, the method is based on the measurement of luminescence of Huh-7 cells, \n\na human hepatoma cell line, following infection with PbGFP-Luccon-expressing P. berghei \n\nsporozoites. At a given time after infection, the percentage of parasitized cells is given by the \n\npercentage of luminescence.

All concentrations were tested and missing bars account for the total suppression of parasite load. \n\n \n\n \n\nFrom observation of the plot, it is possible to conclude that: \n\na) The antiplasmodial activity is dose-dependent, i.e. the compounds are more active at 10 \n\n?M than at 2 ?M; \n\nb) At 10 ?M compounds 2.132, 3.133, 2.135 and 2.138 are the least potent; the remaining \n\ncompounds are considerably more potent, i.e. at least over 2-fold; \n\nc) Similar SAR to that of the blood stage can be found: electron-withdrawing groups on the \n\nterminal aryl moiety still afford more potent compounds, e.g. 2.128 vs. 2.126 and 2.124; \n\nthe introduction of a second chlorine atom does not improve activity, i.e. 2.130 vs. 2.131; \n\ncompounds 2.135 and 2.138 are among the least active, as against the W2 strain; \n\nd) In this case, N-ethyl substitution appears to be detrimental when compared to N-methyl, \n\ni.e. 2.124 vs. 2.125 and 2.126 vs. 2.127, in opposition to what whas observed against the \n\nW2 strain; \n\ne) In the 3-NH2 subset, the terminal OCF3 group also appears to be favourable for activity; \n\nf) At 2 ?M, compound 2.128 is as active as primaquine at 5 ?M. \n\nM\n?\n\n2.\n12\n\n4_\n10\n\n \nM\n\n?\n2.\n\n12\n4_\n\n2 \nM\n\n?\n2.\n\n12\n5_\n\n10\n \n\nM\n?\n\n2.\n12\n\n5_\n2 \n\nM\n?\n\n2.\n12\n\n6_\n10\n\n \nM\n\n?\n2.\n\n12\n6_\n\n2 \nM\n\n?\n2.\n\n12\n7_\n\n10\n \n\nM\n?\n\n2.\n12\n\n7_\n2 \n\nM\n?\n\n2.\n12\n\n8_\n10\n\n \nM\n\n?\n2.\n\n12\n8_\n\n2 \nM\n\n?\n2.\n\n12\n9_\n\n10\n \n\nM\n?\n\n2.\n12\n\n9_\n2 \n\nM\n?\n\n2.\n13\n\n0_\n10\n\n \nM\n\n?\n2.\n\n13\n0_\n\n2 \nM\n\n?\n2.\n\n13\n1_\n\n10\n \n\nM\n?\n\n2.\n13\n\n1_\n 2\n\n \nM\n\n?\n2.\n\n13\n2_\n\n10\n \n\nM\n?\n\n2.\n13\n\n2_\n2 \n\nM\n?\n\n2.\n13\n\n3_\n10\n\n \nM\n\n?\n2.\n\n13\n3_\n\n2 \nM\n\n?\n2.\n\n13\n4_\n\n10\n \n\nM\n?\n\n2.\n13\n\n4_\n2 \n\nM\n \n\n?\n2.\n\n13\n5_\n\n10\n \n\nM\n?\n\n2.\n13\n\n5_\n2 \n\nM\n?\n\n2.\n13\n\n6_\n10\n\n \nM\n\n?\n2.\n\n13\n6_\n\n2 \nM\n\n?\n2.\n\n13\n7_\n\n10\n \n\nM\n?\n\n2.\n13\n\n7_\n2 \n\nM\n?\n\n2.\n13\n\n8_\n10\n\n \nM\n\n?\n2.\n\n13\n8_\n\n2 \n\nC\non\n\ntr\nol M\n\n?\nP\n\nri\nm\n\naq\nui\n\nne\n_5\n\n \n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n50\n\n100\n\n50\n\n100\n\nF\nlu\n\nor\nes\n\nce\nn\n\nce\n(%\n\n o\nf \n\nco\nn\n\ntr\nol\n\n)\n\nL\num\n\nin\nes\n\nce\nnc\n\ne\n(%\n\n o\nf \n\nco\nn\n\ntr\nol\n\n)\n\n\n\nPyridonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n81 \n\nThe toxicity of those compounds was then assayed using the Alamar Blue test.

The structure-\n\nbased approach to optimize the scaffold was successful, i.e. while the most active Mannich-base \n\ncompound 2.1 displayed an IC50 of ca. 8.5 ?M, the most active pyridonimine from the second series \n\nwas 2.131, with an IC50 of 0.94 ?M. The introduction of an extended and lipophilic side chain was \n\nprobably key, and the docking poses of the compounds also give a possible explanation for the \n\nIC50s, on a molecular basis. These compounds also displayed interesting anti-liver activity and can \n\nbe used as leads for further optimizations. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \nQUINOLONIMINE SCAFFOLD \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nQuinolonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n85 \n\n3. QUINOLONIMINE SCAFFOLD \n \n\n3.1 Rationale \nAfter studying the 4-pyridonimine scaffold the attention was drawn to 4-quinolonimines. Since \n\nthat all synthesized compounds from the previous series were obtained as triflate or iodide salts, it \n\nwas hypothesized that the positive charge would be detrimental for the molecule to reach the drug \n\ntarget. Moreover, since those molecules had been designed to inhibit a highly hydrophobic binding \n\nsite, this charge could be responsible for less efficient interactions with the binding pocket. Thus, in \n\norder to eliminate this problem, it was decided to include an extra aromatic ring into the 4-\n\npyridonimine scaffold to decrease the basicity of the imine nitrogen and, consequently, increase the \n\nlipophilicity of the molecules. In fact, the inclusion of a second aryl increases the predicted logP in \n\n1.30 units in test scaffolds, Figure 3.1 [231]. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.1 Predicted LogP for the 4-pyridonimine and 4-quinolonimine scaffolds. \n\n \n\n \n\nIn this series, quinolines that are used to obtain known antimalarials were employed as starting \n\nmaterials, to enhance the eventual antiplasmodial activity of 4-quinolonimines. Since the 7-\n\nchloroquinoline core would be used, it was expected that the resulting compounds could also \n\npresent a mechanism of action similar to chloroquine. Additionaly, the side chains described by \n\nYeates et al. [19] and those derived from the 4-pyridonimine study were used, to obtain some insight \n\ninto the SAR. Furthermore, it was desired to introduce a methyl group at C2, since it had been \n\nreported the importance of this group for the activity of 4(1H)-pyridones, i.e. its withdrawal results \n\nin significant loss of antiplasmodial activity [19].  \n\nThe retrosynthetic analysis for the target molecules is shown in Scheme 3.1. Most of the \n\nchemical reactions were identical to ones that had been used for the 4-pyridonimines, and the \n\nrequired quinoline could be obtained via a Conrad-Limpach cyclization.  \n\n \n\n\n\nQuinolonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n86 \n\n \nScheme 3.1 Retrosynthetic analysis of target 4-quinolonimines. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2 Synthesis \nThe synthetic pathway was identical to the one employed for the structure-based design series \n\nof 4-pyridonimines, i.e. N-alkylation of a given quinoline, followed by SNAr reaction with a \n\ncommercial or synthesized primary amine in ethanol, and TEA as a base.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.1 4,7-Dichloro-2-methylquinoline \n\nIn order to study the effect of the substitution pattern of the quinoline moiety on the \n\nantiplasmodial activity, the synthesis of 4,7-dichloro-2-methylquinoline, 3.1, was tried. This would \n\npresent a key intermediate for a quinolonimine with a methyl group inserted at C2. The synthetic \n\nroute for this intermediate included the synthesis of the required 4(1H)-quinolone, 3.2, from the \n\ncorresponding aniline and ketoester in a Conrad-Limpach procedure, i.e. formation of an imine in \n\nthe first step, followed by an intra-molecular Friedel-Crafts acylation, Scheme 3.2.  \n\n \n\n \nScheme 3.2 Synthetic pathway for compound 3.2. Reagents and conditions: (i) PPA, 3-chloroaniline, 110 \u00baC (ii) 150 \n\n\u00baC. \n\n\n\nQuinolonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n87 \n\nHowever the cyclization step afforded two distinct isomers in equal amounts, 3.2 and 3.3. Those \n\nwere isolated in 87% yield and were not separated at this point. It is also noteworthy that this \n\nprocedure can afford the respective 2(1H)-quinolones, but being the thermodynamic product, higher \n\ntemperatures would be needed, since the imine formation is faster than the formation of the required \n\namide. The two isomers were identified by a characteristic singlet at ca. ? 6.15 ppm in the 1H-NMR \n\nspectrum, which accounts for the proton at C3. Moreover, the protons of the ethyl group were not \n\npresent, which gave evidence of the cyclization step. \n\nOnce 3.2 and 3.3 were obtained the synthesis of 3.1 was attempted with POCl3 under reflux, but \n\na complex mixture was obtained, Scheme 3.3. It appeared that the starting material had \n\ndecomposed, from TLC analysis, and no further attempts were made. \n\n \n\n \nScheme 3.3 Synthetic pathway to compound 3.1. Reagents and conditions: (i) POCl3, reflux. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.2 Quinolinium salt intermediates \n\nThe quinolinium salts 3.4-6 were obtained in good yields from an identical procedure to the \n\npyridinium salts, Table 3.1. Compound 3.6 was obtained in lower yield due to the methanosulfonate \n\nstarting material being already partially hydrolyzed. All three compounds were easily identified by \n1H-NMR spectroscopy, with the key peak at ? 4.5-5.2 ppm corresponding to the N-CHx protons. \n\n \n\n \nTable 3.1 Structure and yields of 3.4-6. \n\n \nCompound R2 R3 Yield (%) \n\n3.4 Cl Et 92 \n\n3.5 CF3 Et 95 \n\n3.6 Cl Me 65 \n\n\n\nQuinolonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n88 \n\nIn regard to the reports of potent antiplasmodial activity of acridone derivatives [100] it was also \n\nintended to obtain an acridonimine, but the N-alkylation of 6,9-dichloro-2-methoxyacridine with \n\nethyl triflate was not successful due to the very poor dissolution of the starting material in toluene, \n\neven at reflux temperature, Scheme 3.4.  \n\n \n\n \nScheme 3.4 Attempted synthesis of 3.7. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.3 1-Nitro-4-phenoxybenzene intermediates  \n\nAnilines were selected from previous studies on SAR for cytochrome bc1 inhibitors, either \n\n4(1H)-pyridones [19] or the 4-pyridonimines described in chapter 2. The selection was made in order \n\nto incorporate a suitable and extended lipophilic side chain, which has been shown to improve the \n\nbc1 complex blocking [100]. The retrosynthetic analysis for the desired side chains is presented in \n\nScheme 3.5. These can be derived from simple starting materials as phenols and \n\nfluoronitrobenzenes. Because the side chains require an aromatic C-O coupling, care had to be \n\ntaken with the needs of a SNAr reaction. A nitro group, as a precursor of the amino group, had to be \n\npresent. The electron withdrawing nature of the nitro function facilitates the nucleophilic attack. \n\nAdditionally, a fluoro atom, instead of another halogen, had also to be present. Fluoride is a very \n\npoor leaving group for SN2 reactions, but the best leaving group for SNAr, due to the small size and \n\nhigh electronegativity, which favours the characteristic ipso attach by the nucleophile, in this type \n\nof reactions.  \n\n \n\n \nScheme 3.5 Retrosynthetic analysis for the phenoxyanilines \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nQuinolonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n89 \n\nThe conversion of nitro intermediates to their aniline counterparts could then be attained in \n\nidentical fashion to the reduction of the nitrostilbenes, which was reported in the previous chapter. \n\nCompounds 3.8-12 were synthesized in good yields from the reaction of the corresponding \n\nstarting materials in presence of a base (Na2CO3) and a coupling catalyst (CuI), i.e. an Ullmann \n\ncondensation, Table 3.2 and Scheme 3.6.  \n\n \n\n \nScheme 3.6 Synthetic pathway to compounds 3.8-13.

Therefore, \n\nthe electron withdrawing nature of the nitro group is not enough to drive the reaction in this case. \n\nThe compounds were identified by 1H-NMR spectroscopy. 3.8, 3.11 and 3.12 present AA\u2019 BB\u2019 \n\nor AA\u2019 XX\u2019 systems in the spectrum, as a result of the para substitution pattern in both aromatic \n\nrings, whereas 3.10 and 3.13 present a more complex spectrum due to the non-equivalence of \n\nseveral protons. \n\n \n\n\n\nQuinolonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n90 \n\n3.2.4 4-Phenoxyanilines intermediates \n\nReduction of the nitro group in 3.8-11 and 3.13 to their respective amines 3.14-17 and 3.19 was \n\nobtained, in good yields, through CTH reaction with TES, as described for the phenetylamines \n\nintermediates. Alternatively, for the 4-Cl intermediate, i.e. 3.12, the nitro reduction was achieved \n\nvia Sn, HCl reaction, to circumvent dehalogenation of the aromatic ring that took place under \n\ncatalytic hydrogenation, Scheme 3.7. The yields can be found in Table 3.3. \n\n \n\n \nScheme 3.7 Synthetic pathway to compounds 3.14-19.

Despite presenting an identical coupling pattern and the same integration \n\nfor each set of peaks, the chemical shifts are significantly different. Compounds 3.8-13 present a \n\npeak at ca. ? 8.5 ppm which is assigned to the the protons nearer to the nitro group, whereas for \n\ncompounds 3.14-19 the most deshieled protons are seen at ca. ? 7.5 ppm. The NH2 protons could \n\nalso be found at ca. ? 3.5 ppm. \n\n\n\nQuinolonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n91 \n\n3.2.5 4-Quinolonimines \n\nThe synthesis of 4-quinolonimines was carried out via their quinolinium triflates in an identical \n\nprocedure to what was described for 4-pyridonimines, Scheme 3.8. Besides the synthesized \n\nanilines, two other commercial building blocks, 4-benzylaniline and 4-biphenylamine, were used to \n\nadd further variation to the SAR analysis that would follow. These compounds were obtained in \n\nexcellent yields and their structures are given in Table 3.4. Compound 3.32 was not isolated. In this \n\ncase, only degradation products from the aniline side chain were recovered. All other compounds \n\nwere isolated as triflate salts. \n\n \n\n \nScheme 3.8 Synthetic pathway to compounds 3.20-32. Reagents and conditions: (i) EtOH, TEA, aniline, reflux. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe compounds were characterized with several spectroscopic techniques, including 1D and 2D \n\nNMR, IR and mass spectrometry. X-Ray crystallography studies were also performed for 3.22. \n\nConsidering all spectral data it was possible to conclude that only the (E) isomer of each compound \n\nwas formed. \n\nThe 1H-NMR spectra of 3.20-31 presented the same general features as the ones exhibited by \n\nthe 4-pyridonimine series. For example, the Ar-H3 resonance in 3.22 appears as a doublet at ca. ? \n\n6.95 ppm (3J = 7.6 Hz), which represents a dramatic upfield shift compared to the value of ? 8.33 \n\nppm for the Ar-H3 in 3.4 (3J = 6.4 Hz). Furthermore, the Ar-H2 doublet can be idenfied at ? 8.47 \n\nppm, whilst protons Ar-H6 (? 7.87 ppm), and Ar-H8 (? 8.31 ppm), are given as doublets. From the \n1H-1H COSY experiment it was also possible to see association between Ar-H6 and Ar-H5 (? 8.64 \n\nppm). The Ar-H5 proton is superimposed to two protons from the AA\u2019 XX\u2019 system, and the other \n\ntwo are found at ? 7.55 ppm. The remaining five protons in the spectrum correspond to the terminal \n\naryl moiety. The N-CH2 peak is found at ca. ? 4.6 ppm which is a common feature for all 4-\n\nquinolonimines. For the remaining compounds, the 1H-NMR spectrum differed mainly at the \n\nchemical shifts and couplings from the terminal aryl, due to the substitution pattern. \n\n \n\n\n\nQuinolonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n92 \n\nTable 3.4 Structure and yields of compounds 3.20-32. \n\n \nCompound R2 R3 Isomer X R4 Yield (%) \n\n3.20 Cl Et 3\u2019 CH2CH2 4-OCF3 76 \n\n3.21 CF3 Et 3\u2019 CH2CH2 4-OCF3 81 \n\n3.22 Cl Et 4\u2019 - H 100 \n\n3.23 CF3 Et 4\u2019 - H 98 \n\n3.24 Cl Et 4\u2019 CH2 H 86 \n\n3.25 Cl Et 4\u2019 O H 92 \n\n3.26 Cl Et 4\u2019 O 4-Cl 83 \n\n3.27 Cl Et 4\u2019 O 4-OCF3 75 \n\n3.28 Cl Et 4\u2019 O 4-CF3 99 \n\n3.29 Cl Me 4\u2019 O   4-CF3 73 \n\n3.30 Cl Et 4\u2019 O 3-OCF3 85 \n\n3.31 CF3 Et 4\u2019 O 3-OCF3 97 \n\n3.32 Cl Et 3\u2019 O 4-OCF3 - \n\n \n\n \n\nThe fragmentation of compounds 3.20 and 3.21 presents similar features to the 4-pyridonimines, \n\ni. e. break at CH2-CH2 bond. For the remaining compounds, the base peak is accounted to the \n\n[M+H]+ adduct, or a peak resulting from loss of the ethyl group. In opposition to the 4-\n\npyridonimine series, the N-C bond is the most labile. Analysis of daughter fragments, allowed to \n\nsee that fragmentation at the linker between the two aryl moieties occurs subsequently, as in 3.28. \n\nHowever, in opposition to its N-ethyl counterpart, compound 3.29 breaks in the linker connection \n\nprior to other fragmentations. This presented the only exception among the studied compounds. The \n\nfragmentation patterns are shown in Figure 3.2. \n\nIn the infra-red spectrum, the imine linkage resulted in absorption at ca. 1600 cm-1, as a \n\nconsequence of stretching vibrations. This is a marginally lower wave number than that of the 4-\n\npyridonimines, as a consequence of the additional aromatic ring, i. e. conjugation. \n\n \n\n\n\nQuinolonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n93 \n\n \nFigure 3.2 Fragmentation pattern for 4-quinolonimines, exemplified by 3.28 and 3.29. \n\n \n\n \n\nIn order to confirm also the (E) configuration for this series of 4-quinolonimines, compound \n\n3.22 was slowly crystallized from water and acetone, affording colourless prisms suitable for \n\nanalysis.

This was expected and consistant with previous reports, since the \n\nimine is not protonated in this case. The aromatic rings of the biphenyl side chain were also not \n\ncoplanar, as given by the C19-C18-C21-C26 dihedral angle of -26.7(2)\u00ba.

Finally, the 4-quinolonimine ring is almost \n\nplanar, as shown by the C2-C3-C4-C5 dihedral angle of 4.4(2)\u00ba. Further details of the crystal \n\nstructure can be found in Appendix 2.1. \n\n \nFigure 3.3 ORTEP view of the molecular structure of 3.22, showing the labelling of all non-hydrogen atoms. \n\nDisplacement ellipsoids for non-hydrogen atoms are shown at the 50% probability level.  \n\n \n\n \nAntiplasmodial activity and toxicity \n\nPolycyclic compounds with the same substructure have been reported to present \n\nantiproliferative activity, namely by selective quadruplex DNA binding. Those have shown to \n\nefficiently target telomere ends, blocking telomerases [232, 233]. Some 4-quinolonimines have also \n\nbeen described for the treatment of memory disfunctions [234], Src kinase inhibitors [235], potassium \n\nion channel inhibitors [236] and topoisomerase II inhibitors [237], but no antiplasmodial activity has \n\nbeen reported. The synthesized compounds were tested against the P. falciparum W2 strain, Table \n\n3.5. They showed improved activity when compared to their 4-pyridonimine counterparts and \n\nclopidol. The additional aromatic ring should be responsible for an increased lipophilicity, and the \n\nconsequent drop in the IC50 values, as was initially hypothesized. Inspection of the data in Table 3.5 \n\nallows the following observations regarding the SAR of 3.20-31: \n\na) Biaryl compounds, i.e. 3.22 and 3.23, were the most active against the W2 strain of P. \n\nfalciparum, presenting activities of ca. 0.55 ?M; \n\nb) Introduction of spacers between aromatic systems is detrimental for the antiplasmodial \n\nactivity, i.e. no spacer (3.22, 0.54 ?M) > O (3.25, 0.89 ?M) > CH2 (3.24, 1.69 ?M); \n\nc) Regarding the 4-phenoxy derivatives, the substituent effect on the antiplasmodial activity \n\nagainst the W2 strain was 4-CF3 (3.28, 1.26 ?M) &lt;4-Cl (3.26, 1.09 ?M) &lt;4-OCF3 (3.27, \n\n\n\nQuinolonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n95 \n\n0.96 ?M) &lt;H (3.25, 0.89 ?M) in opposition to what had been reported for 4(1H)-\n\npyridones and 4-pyridonimines. Isomerization of 4-OCF3, 3.27, to 3-OCF3, 3.30, led to a \n\nsmall drop of activity; \n\nd) Substitution of N-ethyl, 3.28, to N-methyl, 3.29, led to the increase of antiplasmodial \n\nactivity, again in opposition to what had been observed in the previous studies; \n\ne) Substitution of Cl for CF3 at C7 resulted in a 2-fold increase of antiplasmodial activity for \n\nthe phenylethyl derivatives, 3.20 vs. 3.21. However, the trend was not observed for the 4-\n\nphenoxy compounds, resulting in an increase of IC50 from 1.18 ?M for the 7-Cl \n\ncompound, 3.30, to 1.56 ?M for the 7-CF3 counterpart, 3.31.

Therefore, the glutathione \n\nattack was mimicked by reaction of 3.23 with excess TEA and benzylthiol in methanol, for 24 \n\nhours at room temperature, Scheme 3.9.

As a result, this series of compounds represent good \n\nleads for further studies, in particular, against the liver stages of P. falciparum and P. vivax. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nQuinolonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n99 \n\nHematin binding \n\nSince compounds 3.20-31 presented the quinoline scaffold, it was also investigated whether \n\nthey would bind to hematin, in resemblance to other antimalarial drugs. Clopidol was also \n\nincorporated in the study and chloroquine was used as a positive control. \n\nDegradation of the host\u2019s hemoglobin takes place in the food vacuole and results in free heme, \n\ncontaining Fe3+, which is very toxic because it can generate reactive oxygen species. To overcome \n\nits toxicity, the parasite polymerizes free heme into hemozoin, ?-hematin. Thus, by corrupting this \n\npathway, accumulation of toxic by-products occur, leading to the parasite death. It is known that \n\nseveral compounds presenting structurally diverse scaffolds exert antiplasmodial activity by \n\nenhancing the toxicity of free heme. Aminoquinolines are one of the most relevant classes that are \n\nknown to inhibit hemozoin formation, but azoles, isonitriles, xanthones, methylene blue and \n\nderivatives, among others can be also counted in [238, 239]. Despite the distinct mode of binding and \n\nstoichiometry of the complexes with hematin, the inhibition results from intercalation, i.e. non-\n\ncovalent association between drugs and ferriprotoporphyrin IX (FPIX). Therefore, the electrostatic \n\ninteractions of ionizable chemical functions and ?-? stacking of aromatic moieties are responsible \n\nfor the tight binding [240-243]. \n\nTo study the interaction of all compounds with FPIX, an UV-visible spectroscopic method was \n\napplied to determine accurately the binding or dissociation equilibrium constant, Kass or Kd, \n\nrespectively. The titrations were carried out in a mixed aqueous-organic solvent to minimize the \n\nporphyrin aggregation effect, which results in a sizeable hypochromic effect at the Soret band. \n\nTherefore, a buffered 40% (v/v) DMSO was used to provide a strictly monomeric heme species in \n\nsolution, in accordance with Egan et al. [244, 245]. Additionally, all experiments were carried out at 20 \n\n\u00baC and at apparent pH 5.5, to mimic the pH inside the food vacuole of the parasite.  \n\nThe Soret band of FPIX at 400 nm is the net effect of several closely spaced bands, which also \n\noverlaps with the porphyrin N-band [244]. Upon titration with the query compound it was possible to \n\nsee a considerable hypochromic effect, dependent on the concentration of the added ligand. Hence, \n\nthis quenching was used to determine the association constants. The absorbances were corrected for \n\ndilution and a blank titration of the compounds was performed when those exhibited strong \n\nabsorbance at 400 nm. Alternatively, the reference cell, containing only the buffer, was supplied \n\nwith an equal amount of compound as the one added to the titration cell. The experimental data \n\ncurves were fitted into common models to describe ligand binding, and were statistically analyzed \n\nwith ?2 parameters. Model 1, Scheme 3.10, consists of a 1:1 complexation of drug to FPIX, as a \n\nfunction of free ligand concentration. In model 2 there is a stepwise bonding of two equivalents of \n\n\n\nQuinolonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n100 \n\nthe ligand to one equivalent of heme, whereas in model 3 the inverse of model 2 is considered. \n\nModels 4 and 5 consist of a simultaneous binding of two equivalents of ligand or heme to one \n\nequivalent of heme or ligand, respectively. The mathematical equations of the models were \n\ndescribed in detail by Wang et al. [246] and Egan et al. [245]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nScheme 3.10 Models fitted to the experimental curves. \n\n \n\n \n\nChloroquine fitted best to model 1, i.e. 1:1 binding stoichiometry. It presented a logKass of 4.8, \n\nunder these experimental conditions, a value in accordance with what is reported in the literature \n[245]. Despite the different experimental conditions, it has been shown that the logKass value is not \n\naffected significantly by either pH or ionic strength [247]. However, it is also noteworthy that \n\nliterature regarding the chloroquine association constant and stoichiometry of binding is very \n\ndiverse. While Egan et al. report a 1:1 stoichiometry with logKass 5.52 [245], O\u2019Neill et al. report a \n\nstepwise addition of 2 equivalents of chloroquine and logKass1 5.30, logKass2 6.20 [248]. Furthermore, \n\nSurolia and co-workers reported a two-site model with logKass 8.1 and 5.1 for high and low affinity \n\nsites, respectively, and impressive pH-dependent stoichiometries [249]. The attempt to \n\nmathematically fit the chloroquine data, into more complex models was unsuccessful.

The spectroscopic changes in the Soret band when hematin is titrated \n\nwith increasing concentrations of chloroquine can bee seen in Figure 3.6 A. Also, chloroquine \n\nshowed no absorbance at 400 nm, Figure 3.6 B, and the decay of absorbance of FPIX at 400 nm, for \n\nchloroquine, can be found in Figure 3.6 C. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.6 (A) Spectroscopic changes in the Soret band (400 nm) when hematin is titrated with increasing \n\nconcentrations of chloroquine (20 \u00baC, apparent pH 5.5, HEPES buffer with 40% DMSO); (B) Absorbance of \n\nchloroquine under the same experimental conditions as (A). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n300 350 400 450 500\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\nWavelength / nm\n\nA\nbs\n\n300 350 400 450 500\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\nWavelength / nm\n\nA\nbs\n\nA \n\nB \n\n\n\nQuinolonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n102 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 3.7 (cont.)

The curve was corrected for dilution and \n\nabsorbance of the ligand.  \n\n \n\n \n\nClopidol is a known bc1 complex inhibitor and was tested in order to predict the binding affinity \n\nof 4(1H)-pyridones to hematin. Interestingly, in this incubation assay, the logKass was identical to \n\nchloroquine with a value of 4.7 and the 1:1 stoichiometry was the best fit model (r2 = 0.9906). This \n\nwas not an expected result, and binding of clopidol to hematin must be governed by different \n\ndeterminants to those of chloroquine. However, it is important to stress that, despite the strong \n\nassociation, care must be taken in concluding that this might be a secondary mechanism of action, \n\nfrom off-target binding. Clopidol does not present the requested features to accumulate in the acidic \n\nfood vacuole, i.e. it has no ionizable functions and, therefore, it is not expected to accumulate up to \n\nvalues equivalent to the IC50. The same observation had been made for 9-epiquinine. At a logKa of \n\n4.04, it binds to heme but it is known that it does not inhibit hematin polimerization into hemozoin \n[245]. Therefore, binding to hematin appears to be necessary, but not sufficient to safely conclude the \n\nmechanism of action of a given molecule. On a similar note to clopidol, floxacrine binds to \n\nhematin, despite being a potent bc1 complex inhibitor. Also, its WR 243251 imino analogue, 3.34, \n\nshowed identical heme binding to chloroquine, despite being more active against the chloroquine \n\nsensitive (NF54), and chloroquine resistant (K1) strains, which underlies the existence of another \n\nmechanism of action [106, 250]. \n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n[Chloroquine] / ?M\n\nA\nbs\n\n (\n40\n\n0 \nn\n\nm\n)\n\nC \n\n\n\nQuinolonimine Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n103 \n\n \n \n\nFinally, primaquine which is thought to wield antimalarial activity from inhibition of the \n\nmitochondrial function is reported to not show detectable binding to heme [245]. \n\nClopidol did not absorb in the 300-500 nm range and the decay of absorbance of FPIX at 400 \n\nnm can be seen in Figure 3.7 A, as well as the spectroscopic changes in the Soret band, Figure 3.7 \n\nB.

CHROMONE SCAFFOLD \n \n\n4.1 Rationale \nChromones are a class of structurally diverse compounds. Applications of compounds from this \n\nclass, and from the closely related flavones and isoflavones, can be found in the literature, in a vast \n\nnumber of fields. Some have shown potent antipicornavirus activity [251], anticholinesterase activity \n[252], antiproliferative activity [253-257], anti-inflammatory [258], human steroid sulfatase inhibitory \n\nactivity [259], and have even been used as radioligands for imaging [260-262], among others [263-266]. \n\nAdditionally, there have been recent reports of modest to potent antiplasmodial activity related to \n\nflavones [200, 267-270].  \n\nStigmatellin is a natural, chromone-based compound with potent anti-bc1 complex activity and \n\nan IC50 of 2 ?M in whole cell cultures [62, 159]. With the results from the previous series of \n\ncompounds it was, therefore, necessary to insert the side chains that resulted in better \n\nantiplasmodial activity for the 4-quinolonimine series, into diverse chromone rings, in order to \n\nimprove the activity against P. falciparum. Since the antiplasmodial mode of action for stigmatellin \n\nis through the inhibition of cytochrome bc1, all synthesized compounds would be expected to block \n\nthis vital pathway. Also, isoflavones have shown to possess an interesting antiplasmodial activity, \n\nwhich might also be related to inhibition of the mitochondrial function, at the bc1 complex level [271, \n\n272]. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2 Synthesis \n \n\n4.2.1 Retrosynthetic analysis of flavones \n\nA quick search in the literature revealed a wide range of synthetic procedures to obtain flavones \n\nfrom simple starting materials. The Sonogashira carbonylative annulation is a common procedure, \n\nwhere an iodophenol is reacted with an alkyne in presence of carbon monoxide [273-275]. Flavones \n\ncan also be obtained following the Baker-Venkataraman reaction at room temperature, conventional \n\nheating or MW [276-281]. In short, a 2-hydroxyacetophenone is esterified with a suitable acylating \n\nagent, which rearranges to the 1,3-diketone compound under basic conditions. This key \n\nintermediate is then cyclized into the corresponding flavone. Alternativelly, flavones can be \n\nobtained from cyclization of the corresponding chalcones [282-285]. \n\n\n\nFlavone Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n   \n \n\n110 \n\nThe retrosynthetic analysis in Scheme 4.1 shows the general strategy that was employed to \n\nobtain the target compounds. Whereas the 2-hydroxyacetophenones were commercially available, \n\nmost of the required acid chlorides or anhydrides (represented as a synthon) had to be synthesized. \n\nThese chemical entities can be easily derived from carboxylic acids and those can be obtained from \n\nnitriles, which are sufficiently strong electron withdrawing groups to favour SNAr reactions. Some \n\nof these reactions can be carried out as a one-pot procedure or in multi-stage synthesis.  \n\n \n\n \nScheme 4.1 Retrosynthetic analysis of target flavones. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.2 4-Phenoxybenzonitrile and 4-phenoxybenzoic acid intermediates \n\nThe synthesis of 4-phenoxybenzonitrile intermediates was initially carried out using the same \n\nUllmann condensation procedure (method A) described in chapter 3. As an alternative, the reactions \n\nwere conducted under identical conditions, but without the copper catalyst (method B), Scheme 4.2. \n\nThese afforded matching yields over a full day of reflux, when compared to the 5 hours that were \n\nneeded in method A, Table 4.1. However, in method B the purification was simpler, i.e. without the \n\nneed to handle copper salts, which resulted in a less demanding work-up. \n\n \n\n\n\nFlavone Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n111 \n\n \nScheme 4.2 Synthetic pathway to compounds 4.1-4. Reagents and conditions: (i) DMF, Na2CO3, CuI, nuclophile, \n\nreflux; (ii) DMF, Na2CO3, nucleophile, reflux. \n\n \n\n \nTable 4.1 Structure and yields of compounds 4.1-4. \n\n \nCompound Method R3 Yield (%) \n\n4.1 A 4-OPh-4-Cl 95 \n\n4.1 B 4-OPh-4-Cl 100 \n\n4.2 B 4-OPh-4-OCF3 100 \n\n4.3 B 4-O(CH2)3CF3 94 \n\n4.4 B 4-OPh-3-OCF3 100 \n\n \n\n \n\nAll compounds were identified by NMR spectroscopy. Compound 4.3 presented the most \n\ncomplex spectrum. While the OCH2 protons are given as a simple triplet at ? 4.09 ppm, the other \n\nmethylenes display very complex patterns, given the coupling with fluorine. Proton-fluorine \n\ncoupling constants are typically large, and long distance coupling is also possible, resulting in \n\nmultiplets. \n\nThe hydrolysis of compound 4.1 was tested under various conditions. Initially, an acid \n\nhydrolysis with HCl 6N was attempted. This had been the procedure used for the acetamides in \n\nchapter 1, but in this case no reaction was seen over 24 hours of reflux. A more drastic method was \n\ntried, employing concentrated H2SO4 under reflux. Although the reaction occurred, only ca. 1/3 of \n\nthe starting material was consumed to the respective amide. In a third attempt, basic hydrolysis with \n\nNaOH 10% was assayed with a similar result to the hydrolysis with H2SO4. Finally, the reaction \n\nwas achieved by using the basic hydrolysis method described by Sawyer et al. [286]. This involves \n\nthe hydroperoxide anion generated through the abstraction of a proton from H2O2. The nucleophilic \n\nattack to the nitrile, described as the rate-limiting step, is followed by a swift reaction of the \n\nperoxyimidic acid with hydrogen peroxide to originate the corresponding amide. The attack of the \n\nhydroperoxide ion to benzonitrile was shown to be over four orders of magnitude faster than that of \n\n\n\nFlavone Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n   \n \n\n112 \n\nthe hydroxyl ion [287]. These hydrolysis reactions were usually complete in 4 hours. The isolation of \n\nthe required products consisted only in acidifying the reaction mixture and extracting with \n\ndichloromethane, to afford 4.5-8 in excellent yields, Table 4.2. \n\n \n\n \nTable 4.2 Structure and yields of compounds 4.5-8. \n\n \nCompound R3 Yield (%) \n\n4.5 4-OPh-4-Cl 100 \n\n4.6 4-OPh-4-OCF3 98 \n\n4.7 4-O(CH2)3CF3 95 \n\n4.8 4-OPh-3-OCF3 96 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe benzoic acids were identified by NMR. The spectra are identical to their precursors, except \n\nthe protons nearer to the acid function which are more deshielded than in the nitriles. For example, \n\nin 4.5 the most deshielded protons are located at ? 8.11 ppm, while in its nitrile precursor 4.1 the \n\ncorresponding protons are at ? 7.64 ppm. \n\nRegarding the IR spectrum, a strong band at 1675 cm-1 can be found, and is characteristic of the \n\nC=O stretching vibrations for aromatic carboxylic acids. Furthermore, the 3400 cm-1 band provides \n\nevidence of the O-H stretch, whereas those in the 1400 cm-1 area result from C-O-H in-plane \n\nbending. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.3 Flavones \n\n \n\nVia Baker-Venkataraman-like synthesis \n\nIn parallel with the benzoic acid intermediates, the method for the synthesis of flavones was \n\noptimized. Initially the reaction of 2-hydroxyacetophenone with 4-chlorobenzoic acid was \n\nattempted as described by Furuta et al. [258]. The reaction consists of a DMAP-catalyzed acylation at \n\nthe hydroxyl group of 2-hydroxyacetophenone, with a DCC-activated carboxylic acid which is the \n\nsource of the acyl moiety. DMAP plays an important function as it prevents the 1,3-rearrangement \n\nof the intermediate ester to the N-acylurea, which would halt further reactions. Also, the \n\n\n\nFlavone Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n113 \n\nintroduction of a 4-Cl in the terminal aryl would give access to the desired compounds through \n\nreaction with different phenols. However, no reaction was observed. \n\nIn the second attempt it was decided to transform the 4-chlorobenzoic acid to the corresponding \n\nacid chloride with thionyl chloride. This would provide an intermediate with a better leaving group \n\nfor the subsequent reaction, but likewise, no reaction was observed. \n\nIn the third method, the esterification was attempted via a carbonic anhydride. This was \n\nsynthesized from reaction of 4-chlorobenzoic acid with ethylchloroformate, followed by coupling \n\nwith 2-hydroxyacetophenone. Once again, no ester was formed, Scheme 4.3. \n\n \n\n \nScheme 4.3 Synthetic pathway to compounds 4.9. Reagents and conditions: (i) 2-hydroxyacetophenone, DCC, CH2Cl2, \n\nDMAP, rt (ii) a) SOCl2, reflux; b) 2-hydroxyacetophenone, CH2Cl2, DMAP, rt; (iii) a) CH2Cl2, TEA, rt; b) ClCO2Et, rt; \n\nc) 2-hydroxyacetophenone, DMAP, rt; (iv) 2-hydroxyacetophenone, dry pyridine, rt. \n\n \n\n \n\nAnalyzing the procedures that had been tried, it was noted that a base in excess could be \n\nmissing in the esterification process. Furthermore, there is the possibility of an intra-molecular \n\nhydrogen bond in 2-hydroxyacetophenones, which can make the reaction more difficult without the \n\nuse of a base in greater amount. Taking these points into consideration it was attempted the \n\nprocedure described by Ono et al., consisting of an acylation in pyridine medium [261]. Despite \n\nacquiring compound 4.10 from this pathway, Scheme 4.3, it was obtained in only 30% yield, and \n\nwith two more steps left to reach the flavone, this pathway was deemed unsuitable. Next, the \n\nsynthesis was performed as described by Riva et al. [288]. In this study, a one-pot cyclization was \n\nachieved using DBU and benzoyl halides, in a simple and mild procedure. Compound 4.11 was \n\nobtained in good yield, 32% for a combined of 3 steps, over 6 hours of reflux, and after adequate \n\nwork-up and flash chromatography, Scheme 4.4. \n\n \n\n\n\nFlavone Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n   \n \n\n114 \n\n \nScheme 4.4 Synthetic pathway for compounds 4.11. Reagents and conditions: (i) Dry pyridine, 3-\n\n(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl chloride, DBU, reflux. \n\n \n\n \n\nTherefore, the synthesis of the remaining compounds was pursued with minor changes to this \n\nprocedure. Compound 4.12 was initially synthesized as described for 4.11, but remarkably, a \n\nmixture of 4.12 and its C3-acylated analogue was obtained in 1:0.7 ratio, which was not separable \n\ndue to the same Rf. Although such side product had not been reported by Riva et al., C3 acylation \n\nhas been accounted elsewhere, but while using a greater excess of benzoyl chloride [277, 289]. This \n\nside product likely forms from acylation of the ester or the diketone intermediates, rather than from \n\nthe flavone, as proposed in the literature [277].  \n\nTo circumvent this side product, the acetophenone was used in excess (1.5 molar equivalents) \n\ninstead of the acid chloride (1 molar equivalent), but despite obtaining a much higher percentage of \n\n4.12, the C3-acyl side product still formed. The synthesis of flavones without the formation of the \n\nC3-acyl side product was only achieved when an excess of two molar equivalents of acetophenone \n\nwas employed. The structures and yields of the synthesized compounds can be found in Table 4.3. \n\nIn the attempt to obtain 4.19 several other variations were performed in the procedure. Reflux \n\nunder 22 hours still afforded no reaction. In the next variation, microwaves were introduced as the \n\nheating source. When the reaction was carried out for 40 minutes at 150W, up to a maximum of 200 \n\n\u00baC, no reaction was observed, but remarkably, 4.19 was synthesized under milder conditions, i.e. 40 \n\nminutes at 100W and 150 \u00baC. Even though, it was not possible to isolate the compound as a result \n\nof a superimposed Rf with that of the exceeding reagent. Nevertheless, the reaction yield, based on \n1H-NMR spectroscopy, was 27%. Compound 4.18 was also prepared under the same conditions, as \n\na standard to compare with the procedure employing reflux. This compound was obtained in a \n\nhigher yield, 37%, showing the effectiveness of the microwave-assisted synthesis of flavones.  \n\nAlso, in accordance with what was found with the reactions under reflux, the C3-acyl side \n\nproduct of 4.18 was obtained in 9% and 10% yield, when the MW-assisted reaction was carried out \n\nwith 1 and 1.2 molar eq. of acid chloride, respectively. In both cases the yield of 4.18 was ca. 35%. \n\n \n\n\n\nFlavone Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n115 \n\nTable 4.3 Structure and yields (over 4 steps) of compounds 4.12-21 under standard heating conditions and MW-assisted \n\nsynthesis. \n\n \nYield (%) \n\nCompound R1 R2 R3 \nrefluxa MWb \n\n4.12 H H 4-OPh-4-Cl 30 N.D. \n\n4.13 H 6-Cl 4-OPh-4-Cl 15 N.D. \n\n4.14 7-Cl H 4-OPh-4-Cl 32 N.D. \n\n4.15 7-Me H 4-OPh-4-Cl 11 N.D. \n\n4.16 7-Me 6-Cl 4-OPh-4-Cl 21 N.D. \n\n4.17c 7-Me 6-Cl 4-OPh-4-OCF3 40 N.D. \n\n4.18c 7-Me 6-Cl 4-Ph 27 37 \n\n4.19 8-NO2 6-Cl 4-Ph -\n  27 \n\n4.20 7-Me 6-Cl 4-O(CH2)2CF3 15 N.D. \n\n4.21 H H 4-OPh-3-OCF3 37 N.D. \na Conditions: 2 molar eq. of acetophenone, reflux 6-8h. b Conditions: 2 molar eq. of \n\nacetophenone, 100W, 40 min., 150 \u00baC. c Three steps. N.D. - Not Done. \n \n\n \n\nThe scope of this procedure towards the synthesis of 8-nitroflavones was studied from the \n\nreaction of nitroacetophenone with a range of acid chlorides containing both electron withdrawing \n\nand donating groups. Though, the synthesis of compounds 4.22-25 was not achieved, underlining \n\nthe lack of reactivity of the nitroacetophenone. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nFlavone Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n   \n \n\n116 \n\nDue to the lack of reactivity of the nitroacetophenone it was investigated if the \n\naminoacetophenone derivative 4.27 would cyclize to the required flavone. The synthetic procedure \n\nis shown in Scheme 4.5. Reduction of the nitro group was achieved in excellent yield, 94%. \n\n \n\n \nScheme 4.5 Synthetic pathway to compound 4.28. Reagents and conditions: (i) Sn, HCl, EtOH, reflux; (ii) dry pyridine, \n\nacetic anhydride, reflux; (iii) dry pyridine, DBU, [1,1\u2019-biphenyl]-4-carbonyl chloride, reflux (iv) Similar to (iii), MW. \n\n \n\n \n\nHowever, no cyclization was seen in both thermal heating and microwaves. As a result, no \n\nfurther attempts from this pathway were made, to synthesize the nitro and aminoflavone derivatives, \n\ndespite the great interest that these compounds would present for the antiplasmodial activity. \n\nStigmatellin makes a hydrogen bond with H181 from the ISP, through the carbonyl group of the \n\nchromone, and participates in hydrogen bonding with E272 from cytochrome b, through a methoxy \n\ngroup located at C8. Therefore, the 8-NO2, 8-NH2 and 8-NHCOCH3 groups would represent \n\nreplacements of the 8-OMe in stigmatellin, and would likely contribute to the antiplasmodial \n\nactivity of such derivatives. \n\nThe introduction of a hydrogen bond acceptor or donor, in this series of compounds, was then \n\nattempted from the benzyl bromination of 4-methylacetophenone, Scheme 4.6. \n\n \n\n \nScheme 4.6 Synthetic pathway to compounds 4.29 and 4.30. Reagents and conditions: (i) NBS, AIBN, benzene, reflux \n\n2 h; (ii) NBS, AIBN, benzene, reflux 24 h; (iii) MeOH, MeONa, reflux. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe synthesis of 4.29 was not effective in both methods. When a small excess of NBS was used, \n\nas in (i), only 50% of conversion was seen through 1H-NMR, but when the bromine source was \n\n\n\nFlavone Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n117 \n\nused in greater excess, and the reflux prolonged for 24 hours, (ii), several side products were \n\nformed. Therefore the synthesis of 4.30 was not pursued. Alternatively, direct bromination of 4.18 \n\nwas assayed with interesting resuts, Scheme 4.7. When the bromination procedure was attempted \n\nwith NBS (1.2 molar eq.), using benzoyl peroxide as an initiator, only 4.31 was isolated, 27%. This \n\nreaction had been designed for a sole bromination, which might explain the modest yield. Probably \n\nif NBS had been used in a larger amount the yield would have been higher. Since only a small \n\namount of 4.31 was isolated, the synthesis of 4.33 was also not attempted. \n\n \n\n \n Scheme 4.7 Synthetic pathway to compounds 4.31-33. Reagents and conditions: (i) NBS, benzoyl peroxide, CCl4, \n\nreflux; (ii) NBS, ZrCl4, CCl4, rt; (iii) MeOH, MeONa, reflux. \n\n \n\n \n\nAs this method proved to be inefficient for the benzylic bromination of flavones, the procedure \n\ndescribed by Shibatomi et al. [290] was tested. In that paper, the authors report that the ZrCl4 / NBS \n\nsystem promotes benzylic bromintation of toluene derivatives without bromination on the aromatic \n\nring. Interestingly, in this case, only bromination at C3 was achieved, resulting in 4.32, which was \n\nisolated in 10% yield. \n\nThe compounds were characterized with several spectroscopic techniques, including 1D and 2D \n\nNMR, IR and mass spectrometry. The NMR spectra of 3.12-21 presented the same general features \n\namong them. Flavones were promptly identified for the success of the reaction by the characteristic \n\nsinglet at ? 6.7-6.9 ppm. This peak corresponds to the proton at C3 and, therefore, no correspondent \n\nsignal is present in the starting materials. The AA\u2019 XX\u2019 systems of the side chain can be found with \n\n\n\nFlavone Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n   \n \n\n118 \n\ntheir typical symmetric doublet-like pattern, while the proton at C5 is the most deshielded at ? 8.21 \n\nppm. The proton at C8 is also given as a doublet at ? 7.54 ppm (3J = 8.8 Hz). The remaining proton \n\nat C7 is given as a skewed doublet of doublets, as a result of coupling with the protons at C8 and \n\nC5. \n\nThe compounds were also identified by their mass spectra, and the base peak results from the \n\n[M+H]+ adduct. Further investigation into the fragmentation patterns led to the identification of a \n\npeak corresponding to the flavone core, i.e. loss of the phenol group. In turn, this prominent peak \n\ngives rise to another that originates from retro Diels-Alder fission of the heterocyclic ring, the \n\nquinonoid ion. These have already been reported by Itagaki et al. [291] and in Scheme 4.8 an \n\nexample of the fragmentation is given. For compound 4.20, however, only fragmentation of the O-\n\nCH2 bond was seen. \n\n \n\n \nScheme 4.8 Fragmentation pattern of 4.12 and 4.20 as examples for the flavone series. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nFlavone Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n119 \n\nThe IR spectrum for the flavone series of compounds is characterized by the existence of few \n\nbands. Stretching vibrations for the C=O bond are found at ca. 1650 cm-1 which is coherent with the \n\nexpected wave number for six-membered cyclic ketones.  \n\n \n\n \n\nVia chalcones \n\nChalcones are structuraly similar to flavones and also display antiplasmodial activity, possibly \n\nfrom bc1 complex inhibition [139, 144]. These are readily accessible chemical entities from a crossed \n\naldol condensation between acetophenones and aldehydes. Furthermore, if 2-hydroxyacetophenones \n\nare used, the resulting chalcone can be employed as an intermediate for the synthesis of flavones, as \n\nsupported by a broad spectrum of literature [251, 284, 285, 292, 293].  \n\nTo tune up the synthetic procedures, an aldol condensation between nitroacetophenone, and \n\nfreshly distilled benzaldehyde was performed, Scheme 4.9. When refluxing the mixture, no \n\nevolution through TLC was seen after 40 minutes. In this case the 4.34 was isolated in 51% yield. \n\nHowever, when the reactants were left at room temperature with a greater excess of base, for 24 \n\nhours, the chalcone was isolated in quantitative yield.  \n\n \n\n \nScheme 4.9 Synthetic pathway to compounds 4.34. Reagents and conditions: (i) Benzaldehyde, NaOH, reflux; (ii) \n\nBenzaldehyde, NaOH, rt. \n\n \n\n \n\nAfter acquiring the chalcone, four cyclization methods were tested from procedures described in \n\nthe literature, Scheme 4.10 [284, 285, 294]. Methods (i)-(iii) would result in 4.35, from a iodine-\n\ncatalyzed reaction, or from a Pd(II) catalyst. In method (iv), 4.36 would result from a H2O2 \npromoted reaction. However, no cyclization was observed in any case, and only degradation \n\nproducts were recovered. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nFlavone Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n   \n \n\n120 \n\n \nScheme 4.10 Synthetic pathway to compounds 4.35 and 4.36.

Chalcones are typically more active \n\nthan their flavone counterparts in IC50 assays against P. falciparum strains. Therefore, the IC50 \n\nvalue of 4.37 would serve as an indicator on whether to invest further or not in the synthesis of the \n\nflavone derivative. \n\nCompound 4.38 was obtained in quantitative yield from its 4.6 precursor, using TBTU as a \n\ncoupling reagent. TBTU is a widely known reagent and the mechanism of the reaction has been \n\ndepicted by Movassagh et al. [295].

Those correspond to the alkene function, and a 3J = 15.4 Hz allows \n\nto conclude that only the (E) isomer was formed from the aldol condensation. Further inspection of \n\nthe spectrum permits the identification of the AA\u2019 XX\u2019 systems as well as the proton from the \n\nhydroxyl function at ? 13.33 ppm. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.4 Retrosynthetic analysis of isoflavones \n\nA search in the available literature revealed that isoflavones are commonly accessible through \n\nSuzuki-Miyaura cross coupling. Bearing in mind the side chains that were intended to be introduced \n\ninto the scaffold, it was deduced that the required boronic acids would have to be synthesized. \n\nThese can be obtained from Grignard chemistry. Alternatively, the cross coupling could be \n\nachieved with a commercial boronic acid, prior to executing the needed SNAr, Scheme 4.12. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nScheme 4.12 Retrosynthetic analysis of isoflavones. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nFlavone Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n   \n \n\n122 \n\n4.2.5 Attempted synthesis of isoflavones \n\nAs a first step towards the synthesis of isoflavones, compound 4.40 was synthesized as \n\ndescribed by Felpin et al. [296]. In short, reaction of the acetophenone with DMF-DMA results in a \n\npropenone which is cyclized into 3-iodochromone 4.40 in the following step, Scheme 4.13. \n\n \n\n \nScheme 4.13 Synthetic procedure for 4.40. Reagents and conditions: (i) DMF-DMA, 95 \u00baC; (ii) CHCl3, pyridine, I2,  rt. \n\n \n\n \n\nWith this key intermediate in hand, it was possible to attempt the synthesis of several \n\nisoflavones from a Pd-C mediated cross coupling with boronic acids. As a first approach, synthesis \n\nof 4.41 was tested, for this would provide directly the boronic acid of the planned side chain. \n\nHowever, the SNAr did not occur with either 4-(fluorophenyl)boronic acid or 4-\n\n(hydroxyphenyl)boronic acid, despite prolonging reflux for 24 hours, Scheme 4.14. \n\n \n\n \nScheme 4.14 Synthetic procedure for 4.41. Reagents and conditions: (i) DMF, CuI, 4-chlorophenol or 4-fluorophenol, \n\nNa2CO3, reflux. \n\n \n\n \nConsequently, the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling was first performed with 4-(fluorophenyl)boronic \n\nacid and 4.40, resulting 4.42 in excellent yield, 93%. Unfortunately, this was also not reactive \n\ntowards the formation of 4.43, Scheme 4.15. \n\nThe synthesis of 4.43 was also attempted via intermediate 4.44, but the cross coupling reaction \n\nin this case gave an untractable mixture, Scheme 4.16. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nFlavone Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n123 \n\n \nScheme 4.15 Synthetic procedure for compounds 4.42 and 4.43.

Compound 4.45 \n\nwas obtained in moderate yield, 38%, from two days of reflux, Scheme 4.17. This reaction was \n\nexpectedly more demanding than the others that had been performed, containing a nitro or cyano \n\ngroups in the para position, because of the much poorer electron withdrawing nature of bromine. \n\nHowever, since the reaction was carried out in a large scale, enough compound was obtained to \n\nproceed with the following reactions. The synthesis of the boronic acid 4.46 was attempted via the \n\norganolithium species, as described by Yeates et al. [19], and through in situ generated Grignard \n\nreagent, adapting the procedure from Wong et al. [297]. Triisopropyl borate was used as a boron \n\nsource because, being sterically hindered, it would avoid bisalkylation to the corresponding borinic \n\nacid. Moreover, a catalytic amount of iodine was added to the mixture, and it was also sonicated in \n\norder to initiate the Grignard reaction. Though, no reaction was observed in either reaction \n\nconditions. \n\n \n\n \nScheme 4.17 Synthetic procedure for compounds 4.45 and 4.46.

All available data show that this series of compounds present only modest activity, Table \n\n4.4. Nevertheless, those values are in line with analogous flavones reported by Lim et al. and \n\nAuffret et al. [267, 268], displaying IC50s around 10 ?M. Since most of the compounds were tested \n\nonly up to 10 ?M it is not possible to withdraw the SAR for this series. However, the presence of \n\nthe bromomethyl group at C7 appears to be important for the antiplasmodial activity, i.e. 4.31 vs. \n\n4.32. \n\n \n\n \nTable 4.4 Substituent effect on the antiplasmodial activity, against the W2 strain, of compounds 4.12-21, 4.31, 4.32. \n\n \nCompound R1 R2 R3 R4 IC50 \u00b1 SD (?M) GoldScore \n\n4.12 H H 4-OPh-4-Cl H 21.0 \u00b1 0.37 57.15 \n\n4.13 H 6-Cl 4-OPh-4-Cl H > 25.0 58.69 \n\n4.14 7-Cl H 4-OPh-4-Cl H > 10.0 58.57 \n\n4.15 7-Me H 4-OPh-4-Cl H 19.7 \u00b1 2.98 58.27 \n\n4.16 7-Me 6-Cl 4-OPh-4-Cl H > 10.0 61.43 \n\n4.17 7-Me 6-Cl 4-OPh-4-OCF3 H > 10.0 61.60 \n\n4.18 7-Me 6-Cl 4-Ph H > 10.0 53.12 \n\n4.20 7-Me 6-Cl 4-O(CH2)2CF3 H > 10.0 55.18 \n\n4.21 H H 4-OPh-3-OCF3 H > 10.0 58.53 \n\n4.31 7-CH2Br 6-Cl 4-Ph Br 5.96 \u00b1 0.07 63.27 \n\n4.32 7-Me 6-Cl 4-Ph Br > 10.0 52.42 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe synthesized compounds were also docked into the Qo site of the bc1 complex and compared \n\nwith the docking pose of stigmatellin. Two different poses were obtained within this set, Figure 4.1. \n\nFor compounds 4.12, 4.13, 4.15, 4.16 and 4.31 the chromone is located inside the binding pocket \n\nand the side chain in the channel, as in stigmatellin, Figure 4.1 A and B. Stigmatellin interacts \n\nthrough hydrogen bonds with both cytochrome b and the ISP. For the synthesized compounds, the \n\ncarbonyl group is at ca. 2.0 \u00c5 from H181, and the sp3 oxygen of the cromone ring at ca. 5.5 \u00c5 of \n\n\n\nFlavone Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n125 \n\nE272, which is consistent with a possible water-mediated hydrogen bond. The longer distances, i.e. \n\nweaker interactions, compared to stigmatellin might justify the modest IC50 values for the \n\nsynthesized compounds. However, in these molecules, the chlorine and bromine atoms at the \n\nchromone ring are at ca. 3.0 \u00c5 from a carbonyl of the protein backbone. These halogen bonds are \n\nstrong interactions and have been described by Bissantz et al. and Lu et al. [298, 299]. Taking these \n\ninteractions in consideration, compound 4.31 was predicted to be the best binder, which was \n\nconfirmed from in vitro studies. For the remaining compounds, the docking pose is inverted, i.e. \n\nwith the side chain inside the binding pocket and the chromone ring in the channel, Figure 4. C. \n\nInterestingly, all compounds containing the trifluoromethoxy group in the terminal aryl display this \n\npose, probably as a consequence of multipolar interactions with the active residues. Furthermore, \n\nthe shift of 6-Cl in 4.13, to 7-Cl in 4.14 also resulted in an inverted pose. Also, a bromomethyl \n\ngroup at C7 appears to be beneficial for the desired docking pose, 4.31 vs. 4.32. \n\nThe chalcone 4.37 was tested against the W2 strain, but no antiplasmodial activity was seen up \n\nto 10 ?M, probably making the 8-nitroflavone not a very good lead for further drug development. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.1 Docking poses of (A) stigmatellin; (B) 4.12, 4.13, 4.15, 4.16 and 4.31. \n\n \n\n \n\nA \n\nH181 \n\nE272 \n\nC180 \n\nI125 \n\nF129 \n\nL275 \n\nP271 \n\nV270 \n\nI269 \n\nY279 \n\nF278 \nL150 \n\nF296 \n\nI299 \n\nB \n\nH181 \n\nE272 \n\nC180 \n\nI125 \n\nF129 \n\nL275 \n\nP271 \n\nV270 \n\nI269 \n\nY279 \n\nF278 \nL150 \n\nF296 \n\nI299 \n\n\n\nFlavone Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n   \n \n\n126 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.1 (cont.)

The synthesized compounds are able to decrease the infection load of \n\nHuh-7 cells to different extents, when compared to the control, and displayed a dose-dependent \n\neffect on the development of the parasite, Figure 4.2. At 10 ?M, compounds 4.12 and 4.21 were \n\nable to decrease infection in the same order of magnitude of primaquine at 5 ?M, albeit being less \n\nactive than the latter (ca. 3.5- and 3-fold less active, respectively). Also, 4.12 and 4.15 displayed \n\nmoderate antiplasmodial activity in the blood stage, but were more active in the liver-stage. 4.32 \n\nwas essentially non-active against the liver stage, while displaying the lowest IC50 in P. falciparum \n\nW2 strain. \n\nThe IC50 values were determined for compounds 4.12, 4.15 and 4.21, since they showed a \n\nstronger drop in infection between 10 and 2 ?M. While flavone 4.21 presented an IC50 of 8.5 ?M, \n\ncompounds 4.12 and 4.15 showed more potent inhibition with IC50s of 6.2 ?M and 4.1 ?M, \n\nrespectively, Figure 4.3. These results highlight the higher potency of this series against liver \n\nstages, rather than against blood stages of Plasmodia. Also, these molecules are over 2-fold more \n\npotent than the related isoflavone genistein. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the introduction of an \n\nextended side chain into the chromone moiety is responsible for the observed results, and the \n\nfollowing SAR observations can be drawn: \n\nC \n\nH181 \n\nE272 \n\nC180 \n\nI125 \n\nF129 \n\nL275 \n\nP271 \n\nV270 \n\nI269 \n\nY279 \n\nF278 \nL150 \n\nF296 \n\nI299 \n\n\n\nFlavone Scaffold \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n127 \n\na) Introduction of 6-Cl or 7-Cl in the chromone ring is detrimental for anti-liver activity, \n\ni.e. 4.12 vs. 4.13 and 4.14; \n\nb) Simple substitution of 7-Me in the chromone ring is desirable, among the assayed \n\ncompounds, i.e. 4.15; \n\nc) Introduction of 7-Me does not restore significantly the anti-liver activity of compounds \n\ncontaining a chlorine in the core scaffold, i.e. 4.13 vs. 4.16; \n\nd) 4-Cl substitution in the terminal aryl moiety is preferred over 4-OCF3, i.e. 4.16 vs. 4.17; \n\ne) Introduction of a spacer between the aryl moieties that confers flexibility to the side \n\nchain also appears to be critical, as compounds 4.18, 4.31 and 4.32 are amongst the least \n\nactive flavones. \n\nAlso, none of the molecules presented significant cytotoxicity at any concentration in the \n\nAlamar Blue test. \n\n \n\n \n\nM\n?\n\n4.\n12\n\n_1\n0 \n\nM\n?\n\n4.\n12\n\n_2\n \n\nM\n?\n\n4.\n13\n\n_1\n0 \n\nM\n?\n\n4.\n13\n\n_2\n \n\nM\n?\n\n4.\n14\n\n_1\n0 \n\nM\n?\n\n4.\n14\n\n_2\n \n\nM\n?\n\n4.\n15\n\n_1\n0 \n\nM\n?\n\n4.\n15\n\n_2\n \n\nM\n?\n\n4.\n16\n\n_1\n0 \n\nM\n?\n\n4.\n16\n\n_2\n \n\nM\n?\n\n4.\n17\n\n_1\n0 \n\nM\n?\n\n4.\n17\n\n_2\n \n\nM\n?\n\n4.\n18\n\n_1\n0 \n\nM\n?\n\n4.\n18\n\n_2\n \n\nM\n?\n\n4.\n20\n\n_1\n0 \n\nM\n?\n\n4.\n20\n\n_ \n2 \n\nM\n?\n\n4.\n21\n\n_1\n0 \n\nM\n?\n\n4.\n21\n\n_2\n \n\nM\n?\n\n4.\n31\n\n_1\n0 \n\nM\n?\n\n4.\n31\n\n_2\n \n\nM\n?\n\n4.\n32\n\n_1\n0 \n\nC\non\n\ntr\nol M\n\n?\nP\n\nri\nm\n\naq\nui\n\nne\n_5\n\n \n\n0\n5\n\n10\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n0\n5\n10\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nF\nlu\n\nor\nes\n\nce\nn\n\nce\n(%\n\n o\nf \n\nco\nn\n\ntr\nol\n\n)\n\nL\num\n\nin\nes\n\nce\nnc\n\ne\n(%\n\n o\nf \n\nco\nn\n\ntr\nol\n\n)\n\n \nFigure 4.2 Antiplasmodial activity of compounds 4.12-21 and 4.31-32 against the liver stage of P. berghei.

VIRTUAL SCREENING STUDIES \n \n\n5.1 Brief overview on Virtual Screening \nVirtual screening (VS) of chemically available ligand databases has become an useful tool to \n\nsearch the chemical space in recent years, given it accelerates the initial stages of drug \n\ndevelopment. It takes only a few hours or days to screen in silico a library of around one million \n\ncompounds, while a few months are required to screen in vitro (high-throughput screening) the \n\nsame number of chemical entities [301]. Furthermore, it has proven to be effective in several projects, \n\nby applying a good set of filters. As primary constraints to the search, common approaches include: \n\na) Receptor-based, also known as docking- or structure-based strategy, where all the \n\ncharacteristics of the binding site are determined; \n\nb) Ligand-based, or pharmacophore-based strategy, where due to the lack of knowledge of \n\nthe binding site features, known ligands are taken into account.  \n\nOther constraints include, for example, ADMET properties [302, 303].  \n\nHowever, receptor-based VS strategies generally face the problem of protein flexibility, because \n\nit is usually kept rigid to speed up the screening process. In this case, the docking program attempts \n\nto find complementarity between the receptor and the ligand, which is quantified by the search \n\nalgorithm. In ligand-based VS, the program recognizes compounds from the library with the \n\nrequired features to bind to the target. To execute it, a pharmacophore model is built by defining the \n\npharmacophoric features, and the user-defined tolerance zone. Its major advantage over the \n\ndocking-based protocol stands in the throughputness which is considerably higher, making it \n\nadequate for filtering overly large databases [301].  \n\nVS strategies are becoming increasingly popular and have been reasonably successful in the \n\nsearch of new antimalarial leads. While some studies have focused on finding novel leads for a \n\nknown drug target such as hematin and dihydrofolate reductase [304-306], others have delivered leads \n\nfor the design of drug candidates for novel targets. Those include plasmodial kinases [307], falcipains \n[308-310] and enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase [311]. Despite some successful cases, VS is still not a \n\nfully matured technology. Few foundations of ligand-protein recognition are understood well \n\nenough to be deployed in large scale efforts. The role of water molecules, solvation, electrostatics \n\nand entropic changes are problems yet to be solved, which increase the tendency to detect false-\n\npositives [312, 313]. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nVirtual Screening Studies \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n   \n \n\n132 \n\n5.2 3D-Pharmacophore model generation and screening \nWith the intention of filtering out the two chemical databases in an expedite way, a 3D \n\npharmacophore model was generated using the MOE software, which is a highly regarded software \n\nfor this purpose [314, 315].  \n\nThis was modeled from the bioactive pose of GW844520, 1.113, at the Qo site of the bc1 \n\ncomplex described in chapter 2, Figure 2.7 and Figure 5.1. Traditionally, several molecules with \n\nsignificant scaffold diversity are used for the generation of a 3D pharmacophore model, i.e. a \n\nconsensus query. In the present case only GW844520 was used for the model generation, given \n\nthat: \n\na) Currently there is a lack of chemical diversity, regarding the inhibitors of cytochrome \n\nbc1; \n\nb) The inhibitors of the bc1 complex may present different binding modes, making it \n\ninappropriate for aligning features, i.e. the pharmacophores of the different classes of \n\ninhibitors bind distinctively to the active site;  \n\nc) The aim of the study was to find novel leads with the binding characteristics of the \n\n4(1H)-pyridones. By using only one molecule to generate the model redundancy was \n\navoided, since the training set consisted of a different set of molecules. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1 The ligand-receptor interactions for GW844520, 1.113; strong hydrophobic interactions can be seen between \n\nthe side chain and hydrophobic aminoacid residues. Water molecules have not been included in docking calculations, \n\nbut are likely to intervene as hydrogen-bond mediators. \n\n \n\n\n\nVirtual Screening Studies \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n \n\n133 \n\nGW844520 is one of the most potent cytochrome bc1 inhibitors known to date (IC50 = 30 nM) \n[19] and to validate the generated model a training set of 14 4(1H)-pyridones with structurally \n\ndifferent substituents at either C3 and / or C5 was assembled. These were then subjected to a \n\nconformational sampling with MOE, with a determined energy cut-off to avoid redundancy. Chen \n\net al. had shown that the MOE performs at least as well as Catalyst in high-throughput library \n\ngeneration and conformational modeling [316]. Finally, the generated conformers were treated as \n\nrigid entities for the validation screening. The chemical structures and their IC50 values against the \n\nP. falciparum T9-96 strain [19] are given in Figure 5.2.  \n\nIn MOE, a pharmacophore model consists of spheres depicting the tolerance of location allowed \n\nfor each feature. The phamacophore model used for the ZINC drug-like database [317] consisted of \n\nseven features, Figure 5.3 A. Features F1 through F5 represent alternate hydrophobic and aromatic \n\nregions, with hydrophobic represented in green, i.e. F1, F3 and F5, and aromatic regions given in \n\norange, i.e. F2 and F4. The spheres radius was manually adjusted in order to optimize the model. \n\nHence, F1 had a sphere of radius equal to 1.5 \u00c5, F3 a radius of 1.6 \u00c5 and F5 with 1.9 \u00c5. The \n\naromatic region F2 had a radius of 1.9 \u00c5 and F4 a radius of 1.5 \u00c5. Both hydrogen bond acceptor, \n\nF6, and donor, F7, had a radius of 1.0 \u00c5. \n\nThe pharmacophore models proved to be efficient in excluding compounds with an IC50 higher \n\nthan 2,200 nM and compound 1.126, with an IC50 of 2,200 nM, presented the highest RMSD value \n\namongst the 4(1H)-pyridones, Appendix 3.1. Atovaquone, despite the low IC50 against the T9-96 \n\nstrain, presented the highest RMSD value of all hit molecules within the training set. Thus, the \n\nmodel is expected to be restrictive towards compounds presenting features other than those of the \n\n4(1H)-pyridones, regardless of their bc1 complex inhibitory potency.  \n\nPrior to executing the pharmacophore-based VS, the ZINC database was filtered with the \n\nLipinski\u2019s rule of five [318, 319]. This predicts that the poor oral absorption and / or distribution are \n\nmore likely to occur when a molecule has two of the following features:  \n\na) Five hydrogen bond donors; \n\nb) Ten hydrogen bond acceptors; \n\nc) A molecular weight over 500 Da; \n\nd) The calculated logP greater than 5.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nVirtual Screening Studies \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n   \n \n\n134 \n\n \nFigure 5.2 Chemical structures of the training set selected for the pharmacophore modeling. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3 (A) shows the pharmacophore model used to screen the ZINC database; (B) shows the model used for the \n\nMOE database.

However, given that this was still a huge number of compounds to perform a \n\nconformational search in an acceptable timing, a second filter was applied. Database clustering was \n\nachieved by analyzing similarities between the compounds, and was carried out with the algorithm \n\nof Bienfait, which incrementally selects compounds that differ from all previous. The downloaded \n\ndatabase consisted of a 136,996 compound set for which the conformational search was performed. \n\nFor the MOE drug-like database, over 600,000 compounds were supplied with the \n\nconformational library already constructed. Therefore, no other filters were applied before the VS. \n\nIn the in silico screen of the ZINC database with the pharmacophore model, F1-F5 were deemed \n\nessential for a compound to be considered a hit and a partial match of six out of the seven features \n\nwas allowed, by marking that option in the software window. This permitted to drastically reduce \n\nthe database size, without being excessively restrictive. Around 1000 positive hits were obtained, \n\naccording to this methodology, as indicated in Figure 5.4. \n\nFor the MOE database screen, projections of both hydrogen bond acceptors and donors with a \n\n1.4 \u00c5 radius were added, Figure 5.3 B, and retrieved only those compounds that matched every \n\nfeature. This was due to the high number of hits for the MOE database when the first model was \n\nused (over 7,000), which would be unsuitable for the second stage of VS, i.e. receptor-based VS. \n\nThus, employing this methodology the size of the database was reduced to approximately 700 \n\ncompounds which were selected for further refinement, Figure 5.4. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nVirtual Screening Studies \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n   \n \n\n136 \n\n \nFigure 5.4 Virtual screening protocol breakdown. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5.3 Receptor-based virtual screening \nThe hits were docked with GOLD [192] into the cytochrome bc1 model that had been validated in \n\nprevious studies. VS involving docking of large databases can be computationally very expensive. \n\nTherefore it is needed to find an approach that optimizes the balance between the precision of \n\ndocking and the time required for the process. The initial stages of receptor-based virtual screening \n\nare generally executed to discard many compounds quickly, retaining only those which fit the \n\nreceptor. Exhaustive docking for the retained compounds can subsequently be carried out to \n\nestimate their binding pose, and interactions with the target receptor. Thus, in the present study, the \n\ndocking processes were performed in three consecutive stages, employing different settings in \n\nGOLD. \n\n At first, VS was performed with 7-8 times speed-up settings. This is an optimized setting for \n\nVS protocols, since a lower number of genetic operations are done. As a result, a higher throughput \n\nis obtained with acceptable accuracy rates in the prediction [192]. The best 100 ligands of each \n\n\n\nVirtual Screening Studies \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n \n\n137 \n\ndatabase, Appendices 3.2 and 3.3, were subjected to further docking refinement, this time with \n\nstandard settings, i.e. a higher number of genetic operations, but a relatively low number of runs. \n\nThe final GoldScores were ordered, and each ligand was visually inspected for hydrogen bonding \n\nwith histidine 181 and glutamate 272, since these two residues are involved in physiological \n\nelectron transfer across the bc1 complex [58]. Favourable hydrophobic interactions were also sought, \n\nas well as plausible docking poses, based on my experience.  \n\n \n\n \n\n5.3 Antiplasmodial activity \nFrom the 200 molecules visually inspected, 23 compounds were purchased, Figure 5.5, and \n\nshifted to in vitro antiplasmodial testing against the P. falciparum W2 and 3D7 (chloroquine-\n\nsensitive) strains. Out of the 23 compounds submitted for in vitro assays, 7 of them were found to \n\npresent antiplasmodial activity in the micromolar range against the W2 strain, Table 5.1. While one \n\nof the compounds, 5.10, exhibited activity with an IC50 value of 12 ?M against the W2 strain, and \n\n10 ?M against the 3D7 strain, most of the other active compounds presented IC50 values around 30 \n\n?M, i.e. compounds 5.6, 5.11 and 5.12. Compound 5.7 showed an IC50 of around 50 ?M for P. \n\nfalciparum W2. Finally, compounds 5.21 and 5.23 demonstrated activity below 10 ?M, with the \n\nformer displaying an IC50 of 2 ?M. All other compounds did not present noticeable activity up to \n\nthe tested concentrations. \n\nThese results are very encouraging and partly validate the virtual screening protocol, as it \n\nproved to be efficient in identifying active compounds. The expected success rate for a good \n\npharmacophore ranges from 0.5 to 20%, according to Soichet et al. [320]. In this case, the overall \n\nsuccess rate was at least 30% (7 out of 23), since some of the compounds were tested only up to 10 \n\n?M. From those, 6 of the active compounds were from MOE (44% success rate), and only 1 was \n\nfrom ZINC (14% success rate). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nVirtual Screening Studies \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n   \n \n\n138 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.5 Structures of compounds selected from the virtual screening protocol. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\nVirtual Screening Studies \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n \n\n139 \n\nTable 5.1 Biological data for compounds selected from virtual screening. \n\nIC50 \u00b1 SD (?M) \nCompound \n\nW2 strain 3D7 strain \n\n5.1 N.D. > 10 \n\n5.2 N.D. > 10 \n\n5.3 > 25 > 10 \n\n5.4 > 50 > 10 \n\n5.5 > 50 > 10 \n\n5.6 27.1 \u00b1 2.0 > 10 \n\n5.7 49.8 \u00b1 1.9 > 10 \n\n5.8 > 50 > 10 \n\n5.9 > 50 > 10 \n\n5.10 12.1 \u00b1 0.2 10.2 \n\n5.11 28.5 \u00b1 0.3 > 10 \n\n5.12 29.5 \u00b1 2.7 > 10 \n\n5.13 > 50 > 10 \n\n5.14 > 50 > 10 \n\n5.15 > 50 > 10 \n\n5.16 > 10 N.A. \n\n5.17 N.D.

Taken the antiplasmodial activities and the docking poses together \n\none can observe the following: \n\na) All compounds fit well in the active site and show mainly hydrophobic interactions with \n\nthe aminoacid residues, which may be insufficient for an effective blocking of \n\ncytochrome bc1, Figure 5.6. Compound 5.6, is one exception, presenting an interaction \n\nwith the critical histidine 181; the nitrogen of the triazino group distances 2.42 \u00c5 from \n\nthe protonated imidazole group of the protein. The sulfur atom is also at 1.77 \u00c5 from the \n\nsame proton. Despite all compounds complying with the Lipinski\u2019s rule of five, deficient \n\n\n\nVirtual Screening Studies \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n   \n \n\n140 \n\ncell permeability is still possible, which might be one possible factor for the modest \n\nantiplasmodial activity [318], namely for compound 5.6; \n\nb) The presence of a dimethoxyphenyl group in 5.10 is responsible for a 2-fold increase in \n\nactivity when compared to its thiophene counterpart, i.e. compound 5.12. Moreover, the \n\ndocking study reveals a different docking pose for 5.10, Figure 5.6 C, when compared to \n\nits related indole compounds 5.11-12, Figure 5.6 D and E. This may help explain the \n\ndifferent IC50 values, based on a stronger van der Waals interaction with the receptor. \n\nWhile in 5.10 the side chain is docked deep into protein, for 5.11 and 5.12 it is directed \n\nto the outer side of the binding pocket; \n\nc) The insertion of an ethyl or methyl groups in the triazole moiety appears to be \n\ninsignificant for the antiplasmodial activity, i.e. 5.11 vs. 5.12; \n\nd) Compound 5.23 displays an analogous docking pose to 5.10 which is consistent with the \n\nhigher activity, for the triazolylindole subset of compounds. In this case, it appears that \n\nthe oxadiazole ring present in 5.10-12 is also detrimental for the antiplasmodial activity, \n\nas a shorter linker to the terminal aryl moiety, e.g. 5.23, leaves this better accommodated \n\nin the binding pocket; \n\ne) Compound 5.21 displays excellent antiplasmodial activity and a docking pose consistent \n\nwith the in vitro tests. The carbonyl group from the 2-thioxoquinazolinone scaffold is \n\nplaced at 5.00 \u00c5 of E272 and possibly lodges a water molecule between to mediate a \n\nhydrogen bond. The thioxo group is also at 3.83 \u00c5 of H181, which is a documented \n\ndistance for interaction with aromatic moieties [298]. Taken together, these strong \n\ninteractions possibly account for the low IC50 against the W2 strain; \n\nf) Compound 5.20, which differs only in the terminal aryl moiety from 5.21, does not \n\npresent antiplasmodial activity up to 10 ?M. Also, 5.20 exhibits a very similar docking \n\npose to the one seen by 5.21 and, as a consequence, an IC50 in the same order of \n\nmagnitude would be expected. Compound 5.20 has a logSw of -5.06, whereas its 5.21 \n\nanalogue is considerably more soluble in water, logSw = -3.36 (data from the supplier). \n\nTherefore, the observed difference in activity can be related to the better solubility of the \n\ncompound in the assay; \n\ng) For the 2-thioxoquinazolinone subset of compounds it is possible to see that a cyclohexyl \n\ngroup in the side chain is probably important for the antiplasmodial potency, 5.21 vs. \n\n5.18. \n\nIn summary, this VS study allowed the identification of new scaffolds with potential for lead \n\noptimization. ?-Carbolines are known to present antiplasmodial activity in the low micromolar or \n\n\n\nVirtual Screening Studies \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n \n\n141 \n\nnanomolar range [321, 322].

However, compounds with this scaffold have shown great value in \n\ninhibiting human papiloma virus infections [324].

CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES \n \n\nThis doctoral work set out to identify novel inhibitors of the bc1 complex, supported on the \n\nbioisosteric replacement of the carbonyl group of 4(1H)-pyridones and quinolones by an imine \n\nbond. This would allow probing unexplored chemical space, while seeking the obtention of \n\ncompounds with useful antiplasmodial activity. \n\nRegarding the 4-pyridonimine scaffold, the quantum mechanical studies allowed to validate \n\nsuch compounds as isosteres of the related 4(1H)-pyridones. The similarity of their frontier orbitals \n\nand the MEPs pattern, with those of 4(1H)-pyridones provided proof-of-concept on a theoretical \n\nbasis. Also, for the Mannich-base compounds that were selected for this study, the antiplasmodial \n\nactivity correlated well with the complementarity of the electrostatic potential between the binding \n\nsite and the ligands. \n\nThe structure-based design approach that was taken for the scaffold optimization was also very \n\nsuccessful. Starting from lead compounds with an IC50 of ca. 10 ?M, it was possible to design \n\ninhibitors with IC50s around 1 ?M against the W2 strain of P. falciparum. Concerning the blood \n\nstage of the plasmodial infection, the SAR that was found is similar to that of the GSK\u2019s 4(1H)-\n\npyridones. For the liver stage, some of the compounds showed very potent activity at 10 ?M, but \n\nwere also cytotoxic. \n\nFor the 4-quinolonimines, the antiplasmodial activity improved further, possibly from the \n\nintroduction of a second aromatic ring. The most active compounds presented a biphenyl side chain, \n\ni. e. 3.22 and 3.23, and IC50s of ca. 0.5 ?M. Against the liver stage, most of the compounds at 2 ?M \n\nwere at least as active as primaquine at 5 ?M, and were not significantly cytotoxic. Also, these have \n\nshown not to suffer Michael additions at C2. Therefore, these 4-quinolonimines are interesting \n\ncompounds for further studies. Structures to be studied include different subtituents at \n\nquinolonimine core and eventually other aromatic rings in the side chain, 6.1.   \n\nIn relation to their mechanism of action it is necessary to stress that it might be composited by \n\ninhibition of more than one target: \n\na) The docking studies into the bc1 complex provided a rationale for its inhibition; \n\nb) The compounds present a 7-chloro or 7-(trifluoromethyl)quinoline moiety which is similar \n\nto known inhibitors of hemozoin polymerization; \n\nc) The compounds bind to hematin as tightly as chloroquine, and the logKass follows the \n\nsame trend as the antiplasmodial activity; \n\n\n\nConclusions \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n146 \n\nd) The compounds are very active against the liver stage, where no haemoglobin degradation \n\noccurs. Thereby the mechanism of action must be other than the inhibition of hemozoin \n\npolymerization; \n\ne) The SAR for these compounds in both blood and liver stages is different. Bearing in mind \n\nthat the tests were carried out in different species, it is difficult to draw conclusions. The \n\nmost active compounds against the W2 strain, i.e. 3.22 and 3.23, were also the ones that \n\nbound more tightly to hematin. However, 3.22 and 3.23 were among the least active \n\ncompounds at 2 ?M in the liver stage studies. It is possible that, for at least these two \n\ncompounds, more than one mechanism of action exists. \n\nHence, further studies on the mechanism of action are required in the future, namely the \n\ninhibition of the cytochrome bc1 complex. This will also provide the proof-of-concept for the \n\nrationale behind the development of these compounds. \n\nFor the flavone series, only modest antiplasmodial activity against the blood and liver stages \n\nwas obtained, but there are still some chemical modifications in the chromone moiety that may \n\nimprove the IC50. Among those, compounds with the scaffold 6.2 deserve some attention. The \n\nsubstituent at R1 would interact with E272, whereas the substituent at R2 would interact with H181. \n\nAlso, the resemblance to ubiquinol can improve the antiplasmodial activity. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nRegarding the virtual screening studies a 3D-pharmacophore model was built and successfully \n\nsieved two databases into a workable number of compounds for the structure-based VS. From 23 \n\ncompounds tested in vitro, 7 displayed antiplasmodial activity. From those, 3 had an IC50 of 10 ?M \n\nor better, with the most active at an IC50 of 2 ?M, 5.21. More importantly, three novel scaffolds for \n\ndrug development were discovered: triazolylindoles, triazinoindoles and 2-thioxoquinazolinones. \n\nBesides, this is the first VS study targeting the bc1 complex, to the best of my knowledge. \n\n\n\nConclusions \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n147 \n\nFinally, this work has enabled the understanding of the required features that an effective bc1 \n\ncomplex inhibitor must have.

All calculations were performed with the Gaussian 03 package [332]. \n\nGeometry optimizations were first carried out at the semi-empirical level of theory, AM1 [333]. A \n\nmore refined minimization was then achieved at a quantum mechanical level, using DFT [334] with \n\nthe hybrid B3LYP functional, which is a combination of Becke\u2019s three parameter (B3) exchange \n\nfunctional [335] with the Lee, Yang, and Parr (LYP) correlation functional [336] and the 6-31G(d,p) \n\n\n\nExperimental Section \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n202 \n\nbasis set, which adds polarized functions to both heavy atoms and hydrogen atoms. This hybrid \n\nfunctional and basis set has been described to calculate accurate energies [173]. The resulting \n\ngeometries were found to be local minima on their potential energy by calculating harmonic \n\nfrequencies. Molecular frontier orbitals, HOMO and LUMO, and MEPs of all optimized structures \n\nwere visualized with Molekel 4.3 [337]. These MEP outlines provide a measure of the overall size of \n\nthe molecule and the colour-coded surface gives location of the negative and positive electrostatic \n\npotentials, as a function of attraction or repulsion of a positively-charged test probe, respectively. \n\nMEP isoenergy contours were generated in the range of -0.15 and +0.15 e/au3. \n\n \n\n \n\n7.5.2 Molecular docking and virtual screening \n\n \n\nProtein preparation and molecular docking \n\nThe cytochrome bc1 from the baker\u2019s yeast (PDB code 1KYO) [43] was used. This presents the \n\ndimeric and functional protein with the iron-sulfur cluster in close contact with cytochrome b, \n\nwhich is crucial for electron transfer. The protein preparation was carried out using UCSF Chimera \n[338]. Hydrogens were added to aminoacid residues, partial charges were assigned with Antechamber \n[339], the energy was minimized and the output saved as mol2 file. Histidine 181 at the Qo site was \n\nkept protonated, as good evidence of such state is available for stigmatellin binding [63]. Docking \n\nwas performed with the GOLD 3.02 or 4.01 [192] packages that search the best ligand interaction \n\npose, inside the binding pocket, using a genetic algorithm. Docked ligands were ranked with the \n\nGoldScore [193] scoring function included in the software, and defined by the following components: \n\nprotein-ligand hydrogen bond energy, protein-ligand van der Waals energy, ligand internal van der \n\nWaals energy and ligand torsional strain energy. This fitness function has been optimized to predict \n\nthe ligand binding position and conformation of the ligands.

Database \n\nfiltration was performed to collect only drug-like compounds for the docking studies, by applying \n\nthe Lipinski rule of five [319]. The database was further reduced using a 90% diversity set, which \n\nafforded 136,966 compounds for virtual screening.  \n\nAs for the MOE database, only the drug-like subset, comprising over 600,000 compounds was \n\nused. \n\n \n\nPharmacophore modeling and screening \n\nThe pharmacophore was generated from the bioactive pose of GW844520, using the unified \n\nscheme in MOE to identify the pharmacophoric features. The algorithm uses active compounds to \n\nderive the pharmacophore without taking their biological data into account. Two different models \n\nwere constructed and validated including the following features: hydrophobic centroid, amoratic \n\ncentre, hydrogen-bond acceptor and its projection, hydrogen-bond donor and its projection. The \n\nradius of each feature was varied until a good selection of active molecules within a training set of \n\n14 compounds was achieved. In order to fully validate the models, it was sought that the RMSD \n\nvalues would rank accordingly to the IC50s against the T9-96 strain [19]. \n\nA conformational search using MOE was carried out to generate conformers for all compounds \n\nof the databases. In brief, this algorithm employs a parallelized fragment-based approach, in which \n\nmolecules are divided into overlapping fragments. Each fragment is then submitted to a stochastic \n\nconformational search. The resulting fragment conformers are minimized and then assembled by \n\nsuperimposing common atoms. 250 conformations were generated for each compound, using the \n\nMMFF94x forcefield and a strain limit of 4 kcal/mol was employed to limit redundant conformers. \n\nNo other input filters were applied. Virtual screening was then carried out for the two databases and \n\nonly the lowest RMSD result for each hit was saved to advance to the docking studies. \n\n \n\n\n\nExperimental Section \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n204 \n\nReceptor-based screening and docking \n\nIn the first stage of the screen, 500 runs on a 7-8 times speed up setting were conducted for each \n\nof the ca. 2000 compounds that matched the pharmacophore query. The top 100 results (10%) from \n\neach database were selected for the second phase of the receptor-based screen. This was performed \n\nwith 250 runs under default settings. For both screening rounds only the top 5 poses of each \n\ncompound were stored and the results from the second phase of screening were visually inspected \n\nwith PyMol [46] based on the following criteria: (i) hydrogen bond with histidine 181 and glutamate \n\n272; (ii) hydrophobic interactions and complementarity between ligand and binding pocket.  \n\nThe active compounds from the in vitro tests were subjected to the third docking round, \n\nconsisting of 10,000 runs in default settings, in order to better predict the molecular interactions \n\nwithin the Qo site of cytochrome bc1. \n\n \n\n \n\n7.6 Hematin binding studies \nTitration of hematin was carried out in buffered 40% DMSO at apparent pH 5.5. Chloroquine, \n\nclopidol and compounds 3.20-31 were prepared in the following way: stock solutions were obtained \n\nby dissolving accurately weighed hematin, chloroquine, clopidol and 3.20-31, in UV-spectroscopy \n\ngrade DMSO, to a concentration of 1-5 mM, and stored in the fridge and dark. A buffered 40%  \n\n(v/v) DMSO solution was prepared in 250 mL volumetric flasks using DMSO (100 ml), aqueous \n\nHEPES 1M (5 ml) and completing up to the mark with deionized water. Aqueous buffered DMSO \n\n40% (v/v) solutions of hematin, chloroquine, clopidol and 3.20-31 were prepared daily by mixing \n\nan accurately measured sample of the stock solution ca. 500 ?L (via microsyringe) and diluting to 1 \n\nmL with buffered 40% (v/v) DMSO solution. Hematin solutions of 10 ?M were prepared with \n\nbuffered 40% (v/v) DMSO solution, and transferred to the titration and reference cells. Solutions of \n\nchloroquine, clopidol and 3.20-31 were initially added to the cuvette in amounts as small as 2 ?L, \n\ngradually increasing the volume in subsequent additions, until the final concentrations were higher \n\nthan the hematin concentration, which is given by a plateau. After each addition the cuvette was \n\nstirred for one minute before the absorbance was taken. UV-Visible titrations were performed in a \n\nthermostated (20 \u00baC) cell holder. Scans were run between 300 nm and 500 nm to incorporate the \n\nSoret band of the porphyrin. The UV-Visible spectra obtained after each titrated addition was \n\nanalyzed and stacked against the corresponding absorbances. Dissociation constants of the ligands, \n\ncomplexed with the FPIX-OH, were determined by fitting the experimental data to the appropriate \n\nequation models [245], using least squares nonlinear regression analysis with GraphPad Prism \n\n\n\nExperimental Section \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n205 \n\ncomputer program (GraphPad software, Version 5.00, San Diego, CA). Models were analyzed by ?2 \n\nparameters.
