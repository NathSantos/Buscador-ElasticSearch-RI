This site is\na sambaqui (shell mound), in which several human occupation remains are found during pre-colonial\nperiod such as buried lithic and bone artifacts, fire-place, etc. Most of these mounds include as well many\nhuman burials, which, in many cases, point to funerary ritual as a main agency for mound building. A set\nof profiles of apparent electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility was acquired in two sites\naiming the identification of geophysical anomalies with potential interest for excavation. To enhance\nconductivity data, we applied an effective procedure to remove topographical effects in the apparent\nconductivity measurements, which are rather conditioned by the presence of a variable water table\ndepth or conductive sediment layer. A linear dependence among conductivity values and the site\nelevation provided a simple linear model to remove the influence of topography. Corrected electric\nconductivity maps substantially improved the definition of anomalies, many of them rather subtle in raw\ndata images. Corrected maps also show a better adherence with magnetic susceptibility maps, both of\nthem identifying archaeological structures of interest: a well-structured fire-place and a concentration of\nceramic fragments.\n\n? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The use of shallow geophysics has effectively contributed\nwith no destructive actions in modern archaeological studies, by\nidentifying favorable places for excavation in reduced time and costs\n(Conyers and Goodman, 1997). Among geophysical methods with\napplications in archaeology, inductive electromagnetic and GPR\nmethods are highlighted due to their robustness and functionality in\ndata acquisition and interpretation (Conyers, 2004; Reynolds, 1997).\n\nInductive electromagnetic methods have found many applica-\ntions such as, archaeology (Tabbagh, 1986; Bevan, 1991; Dalan,\n1991; Clay, 2001; Gomes, 2003; Venter et al., 2006; Rodrigues et al.,\ninpress), precise agriculture (Corwin and Lesch, 2003; Oliveira\net al., 2005), mapping of metallic piping (Borges and Porsani, 2003;\n: \u00fe55 11 30915034.\n\nAll rights reserved.\nCarpenter and Deignan, 1993; Cisar et al., 1993; Maclean et al., 1991;\nMcNeill, 1980), and soil salinity (Bennett and George, 1995; Tri-\nantafilis et al., 2000), among others. Theoretical basis to this\nmethod can be found in (Keller and Frischknecht, 1966; McNeill,\n1980; Telford et al., 1990).\n\nThere are various geophysical equipments that by using induc-\ntive electromagnetic method principles, such as EM31, EM34,\nEM38, EM61 (Geonics, Instruments), among other instruments. In\nthis work, EM38 equipment was used (Geonics, 1998). The mapping\nby using EM38 equipment provides the spatial variation of the soil\nelectrical conductivity, and magnetic susceptibility. The equipment\npossesses two coils spaced of 1 m, working with 14.6 kHz of\nfrequency, and it could be employed through two acquisition ways:\nVertical Magnetic Dipole \u2013 VMD \u2013 that allows investigating up to\n1.5 m of depth, and Horizontal Magnetic Dipole \u2013 HMD \u2013 that\nallows investigating up to 0.75 m of depth (McNeill, 1980). As\nelectrical conductivity as magnetic susceptibility derive of a rela-\ntion between primary and secondary electromagnetic fields, seeing\nthat electrical conductivity correspond to a quadrature component\n\nmailto:porsani@iag.usp.br\nwww.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/03054403\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/jas\n\n\nFig. 1. Study area localization in Jaguaruna region, Santa Catarina state, Brazil.\n\nFig. 2. Acquisition of electric conductivity profiles with EM38 equipment.\n\nV.R.N. Santos et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 36 (2009) 2089\u201320952090\n(imaginary part) and magnetic susceptibility correspond to a phase\n(real part) of these fields.\n\nAccording to McNeill (1980), the ratio between secondary\nmagnetic (HS) and primary magnetic (HP) field is linearly propor-\ntional to electric conductivity (s) of mean, being expressed by:\n\ns \u00bc\n4\n\num0s\n2\n\n?\nHS\nHP\n\n?\nq\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u2018\u2018u\u2019\u2019 is angular frequency (u \u00bc 2pf), \u2018\u2018m0\u2019\u2019 is magnetic\npermeability of vacuum, \u2018\u2018s\u2019\u2019 is the space between sensors (trans-\nmiter-Tx and receiver-Rx), and \u2018\u2018q\u2019\u2019 denote a part in quadrature of\nthese field. On the other hand, magnetic susceptibility (cm) values\nare obtained with equipment in vertical magnetic dipole \u2013 VMD \u2013\nmode by the means of conductivity measurements accomplished in\nsoil surface (sVMD0 ), and in 1.5 m of height (s\n\nVMD\n1;5 ), whose\n\nmeasurement difference is given by:\n\nDs \u00bc sVMD0 ? s\nVMD\n1;5 (2)\n\nThus, magnetic susceptibility (cm) value could be obtained by\nexpression:\n\ncm \u00bc 58 ? 10\n?6Ds (3)\n\nIn this work we show that irregularities in terrain surface\nmeaningfully distort the conductivity maps, even hiding anomalies\nwith archaeological structures. Topography disturbance, however,\nseems to be cast in a very predicable way: higher the elevation,\nlower its apparent conductivity. At least for the studied sites, this\nsimple behavior can be associated to the distance of sensor\nregarding a shallow water table. Since EM38 signal is focused to\nabout 0.5 m depth (VMD mode) (McNeill, 1980), its signal response\nin depressions is to a large extent conditioned by conductive\nsaturated zone. Otherwise, in elevations, its response reflects the\nlow conductivity values usually found in vadose zone. In the middle\nof such limiting heights, a smooth variation in apparent conduc-\ntivity is observed, and conductivity maps exhibit a regional pattern,\nhigher correlated with site relief.\n\nIn the study of contaminated sites, a practical procedure was\nproposed to remove such regional effect from EM31 and EM34 data\n(Monier-Williams et al., 1990). This article shows that the depen-\ndence among electric conductivity values and site elevation\nprovided a linear model to remove the topography influence. This\nprocedure is applied here intending to enhance the response from\narchaeological targets that in some cases were note clearly distin-\nguished. Despite good results in contaminated areas, there are no\nrecords in scientific literature about removal of topographic effects\nin measures of electrical conductivity carried out with inductive\nelectromagnetic method applied in study of archaeological sites up\nto now.\n\nThis simple predicable variation are associated to underground\nconductivity, for example conductive sediment layers, and the\nvariation in water table depth that usually follow the topography,\nseems to be a main factor conditioning the electromagnetic\ninduction response, with capacity for even hiding small variations\nproduced by archaeological targets. In this article it is presented an\neffective methodology that removes the influence of topography in\nelectrical conductivity data obtained by inductive electromagnetic\nmethods, and it shows two examples of application in archaeo-\nlogical site studies.\n\n2. Santa Marta archaeological site\n\nSanta Marta sambaqui archaeological site is located at Jaguaruna\nregion, in Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil (Fig. 1). Sambaqui is\na guarani (Brazilian native language) word meaning: Tamba? \u2013 shells\nand Qui \u2013 conic mound, or shell mound. These sambaquis are\nconstituted by a high variation in volume and morphology, pre-\nsenting a distribution and concentration pattern defined by sedi-\nments. According to DeBlasis et al. (1998), these structures were\nbuilt by inhabitants that lived in south of Brazil during pre-colonial\nperiod, about 6000 years before present.\n\nSambaquis (as already said, it is an original word from native\nTupi language, literally meaning \u2018\u2018shell mounds\u2019\u2019 or concheiros) are\narchaeological mounded sites distributed all over Brazilian coast,\nmainly at ecologically patchy areas involving brackish waters,\nmangrove and forests such as lagoon, bay and coastal island areas.\nThese sites present different sizes, achieving impressive dimen-\nsions especially at southern coast of Santa Catarina, where they\nmay reach up to 70 m height and 500 m width. In general, they\nexhibit heterogeneous stratigraphic sequences differently\ncomposed, mostly thicker shell layers irregularly intercalated with\nsmaller dark strata richly composed of organic materials, including\nabundant funerary structures in specific areas. In fact, several\nburials are reported in most sambaqui descriptions, disposed ritu-\nally in specially prepared places, frequently accompanied of arti-\nfacts, food offerings and fire-place (DeBlasis et al., 2007; Gaspar\net al., 2008).\n\nThe application of geophysical surveying methods to these\nmounds aims a quicker, larger, and non-destructive understanding\nof underlying structures as well as the identification of punctual\nfeatures such as fire-place and burials without intensive digging,\nconsequently contributing to preservation of prehistoric Brazilian\nheritage. It is expected such structures generate resistive anomalies\n\n\n\nFig. 3. Schematic of topographic variation influence in measurements of electric\nconductivity with inductive electromagnetic method.\n\nFig. 5. Relation between apparent electric conductivity in terms of topographic vari-\nation to grid-2.\n\nV.R.N.

However, some\nstructures could provoke anomalies values of high electrical\nconductivity, and magnetic susceptibility as paleo-fires that present\nremaining magnetization. This magnetization can be caused by\nfreezing of Earth magnetic field in ferromagnetic minerals present\nin rock fragments during the burnt processes.\n\n3. Data acquisition and treatment\n\nTwo areas of Santa Marta archaeological site \u2013 grid-1\n(25 m ? 10 m), and grid-2 (20 m ? 5 m) \u2013 have been investigated. In\ngrid-1, measurements were done along 11 parallel inductive elec-\ntromagnetic profiles, and in grid-2, along 6 lines. In both areas the\nlines were orientated from south to north direction. Lines were\nregularly separate of 1 m, and measurements were done along line\nin 0.5 m of interval.\n\nMeasurements were carried out with EM38 equipment in VMD\nmode (Fig. 2) for a deeper investigation depth. During data acqui-\nsition, a base point was set for further drift correction. This proce-\ndure is necessary to guarantee a good data quality, by avoiding\nconductivity variations caused by changes in the equipment\ntemperature (Sudduth et al., 2001).\nFig. 4. Relation between apparent electric conductivity in terms of topographic vari-\nation to grid-1.\nTerrain elevation was measured with a Leica TCR305 infra-red\ntotal station, by taking random measurements along lines. Approx-\nimately one measurement per square meter was taken. Elevation\nmodel errors were below some few millimeters.\n\nTopographic variation effect in the apparent electric conduc-\ntivity measurement by using inductive electromagnetic method is\nillustrated in Fig. 3. According to this conceptual model when\nsensors (Tx and Rx) are put at a topographic lower part (h) they are\nclose to conductive sediments or water table (conductors), so\nelectric conductivity measurement values are higher. This fact\nFig. 6. Normalized apparent conductivity measurements in terms of topographic\nvariation to grid-1. Red line correspond to the best adjust for data.\n\n\n\nFig. 7. Normalized apparent conductivity measurements in terms of topographic\nvariation to grid-2. Red line correspond to the best adjust for data.\n\nV.R.N. Santos et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 36 (2009) 2089\u201320952092\nhappens due to higher sensor proximity with saturated sediments\nthat are more conductive than background one, provoking an\nincreasing in induction of electrical current (Is) in the conductor,\nincreasing measured electrical conductivity values measured by\nequipment. On the other hand, where topography is higher (H),\nconductive sediments or the water level is kept distant of sensors so\nthe conductivity reading by equipment is lower. In other words,\nmore distant sensors are from saturated sediments in subsurfaces,\nlower electrical current induction in the conductor will be, it\nmeans, electrical conductivity influence in conductor will be lower;\nso electrical magnetic field intensity is attenuated by mean,\ndecreasing electrical conductivity values measured by equipment\n(McNeill, 1980).\nFig. 8. Map of apparent electric conductivity (raw dat\nThe relation between topographical variation and apparent\nconductivity measurements in grid-1 and grid-2 are presented in\nFigs. 4 and 5, respectively. Fig. 4 was elaborated starting from a set\nof 561 points of apparent conductivity to grid-1 area, and Fig. 5 was\nelaborated starting from a set of 246 conductivity values to grid-2.\nNote there is a well defined linear data trend for both areas. This\nfact clearly indicates data suffer influence of topographical varia-\ntion. Thus, they can be corrected. On the other hand, magnetic\nsusceptibility (equation 3) does not possess any relation with\ntopographical variation, it means, with proximity of saturated\nsediments, because it only depends on the amount of magnetic\nminerals presented in material, so it does not need correction.\n\nTo analyze the dependence of conductivity values with elevation,\nelectromagnetic induction and topographic data were interpolated\non a regular same size mesh. This task was necessary because both\ndata sets have no coincident reading points. Conductivity and\nmagnetic susceptibility data were acquired along regular S-N profiles\nbut elevation heights were randomly acquired, only guaranteeing\na suitable data density. That occasion, data were adjusted for regular\nmesh with coincident points, and maps were elaborated. With data\nadjustment in regular grids, effect of temperature drift was reduced\nby the means of procedure described by Sudduth et al. (2001).\nSubsequently, apparent conductivity and magnetic susceptibility\nmaps were elaborated. It is important to note these procedures are\nusually applied in processing grid data and they are not effective in\nremoving elevation influence. Following procedures to remove\ntopographical effect in conductivity data are shown.\n\nIn order to correct elevation effect, we applied the following\nequation (Monier-Williams et al., 1990):\n\nC\u00f0x; y\u00de \u00bc 20,log10\n\n\"\nsap\u00f0x;y\u00de\nsap\u00f0bac\u00de\n\n#\n(4)\n\nwhere C (x,y) is electrical conductivity value normalized in decibel\n(dB) at position (x,y), sap(x,y) is apparent conductivity, and sap(bac) is\nbackground electrical conductivity. In this work, the reduction of\ntopographic effect in apparent conductivity measure was done\nthrough its normalization by apparent mean background conduc-\ntivity value obtained from all data set measurement for grid-1 and\ngrid-2. The mean conductivity value of background obtained for\na) overlapped to topographic variation to grid-1.\n\n\n\nFig. 9. Results to grid-1. a) Map of \u2018\u2018raw\u2019\u2019 apparent electric conductivity. b) Map of \u2018\u2018regional\u2019\u2019 apparent electric conductivity. c) Map of \u2018\u2018residual\u2019\u2019 apparent electric conductivity. d)\nMap of magnetic susceptibility.\n\nV.R.N. Santos et al. / Journal of Archaeological Science 36 (2009) 2089\u20132095 2093\ngrid-1 was 15.04 mS/m, and for grid-2 was 6.83 mS/m. Mean\nconductivity of background used in this work is due to this measure\nbe statistical robust (Barbetta, 2002).\n\nSince there are relation linear trend between electric conductivity\nand topographic variation, and electric conductivity values of\nbackground, also called \u2018\u2018regional conductivity\u2019\u2019 can be determined,\nso topography influence can be corrected. Figs. 6 and 7 shows\nnormalized apparent conductivity measurements in terms\nof topographic variation to grid-1 and grid-2, respectively. Note\nto grid-1 straight line equation of better adjust is done by\n(y \u00bc?4.6705x \u00fe 450.72), and to grid-2 straight line equation is done\nby (y\u00bc?1.4272x \u00fe 138.38). In such a way, final apparent conduc-\ntivity \u2018\u2018y\u2019\u2019, without topographical influence, was calculated by these\nequations whose topographical values are replaced in \u2018\u2018x\u2019\u2019. This\ncorrection allows enhancing the obtained apparent conductivity\nanomalies with inductive electromagnetic method before masked\nfor topographical variation influence.\nFig. 10. Paleo-fire found after excavation in grid-1.\n4. Analysis of results\n\n4.1. Grid-1\n\nFig. 8 shows apparent electric conductivity data overlapped to\nthe topographical variation for grid-1. As it can be observed in the\nfigure, topography influence in conductivity values is clear. This\neffect is enough evident, it means, the place where a low topo-\ngraphical exists apparent electric conductivity value is raised; on\nthe other hand, in places topographically higher, electric conduc-\ntivity values are low.\n\nFig. 9 shows raw data apparent conductivity map (a), background\nconductivity map (b), residual conductivity map (c), as well as the\nmagnetic susceptibility map (d). Residual conductivity map corre-\nsponds to apparent conductivity map corrected for topographical\neffect obtained from subtraction of measured conductivity map by\napparent background map. Residual map shows as negative as\npositive conductivity values. Negative values indicate it is less than\nregional conductivity, and positive more. Although negative\nconductivity values do not have physical meaning, these values were\nincluded by bearing in they are referenced to a particular background\nvalue. In this sense, conductivity anomaly is distinguished, and not\ntrue physical property value. With magnetic susceptibility data\nintegration we have elements to better understand these residual\nanomalies; therefore we prove the presence of this anomaly for\napparent conductivity residues and magnetic susceptibility.\n\nApparent corrected conductivity clearly evidences a conduc-\ntivity anomaly (C1) that before topographic correction was not\nclearly observed. Note that information about magnetic suscepti-\nbility allowed defining a significant magnetic anomaly (M1), which\nmatches with observed conductivity anomaly positioning. The\nother two conductivity anomalies observed in Fig. 9c (position\nx \u00bc 9 m, y \u00bc 16 m, and 19 m) are less relevant because there are not\ncorrespondence with magnetic susceptibility data. As a conse-\nquence, they were not indicated as potential archeological targets.\n\nArchaeologists\u2019 team from Universidade de Sa?o Paulo, leaded by\nDeBlasis, has accomplished archeological excavation in study areas,\ntaking as base results obtained in this research.

Then, the effect of topographical correction for this\nanomaly was not so significant. Information about magnetic\nsusceptibility for grid-2 also defined the existence of a strong\nmagnetic anomaly (M2).\n\nIn grid-2 area a concentration of ceramic material (Fig. 13) cor-\nresponding to conductivity (C2) and magnetic susceptibility (M2)\nanomalies was found. Geophysical results obtained in here were\nfundamental to time optimization, and involved resources with\ndrilling steps. Archaeological researches are in progress, and their\nexcavated archaeological material samples were sent for dating.\n5. Conclusions\n\nCorrection of topography effect in apparent electric conductivity\ndata through its normalization by background conductivity mean\nwas effective for the two study areas located in sambaqui archae-\nological site from Santa Marta, Santa Catarina state, Brazil. Electric\nconductivity anomalies were enhanced by improving possibilities\nof success in archaeological excavation. This procedure could be\nused to enhance masked archaeological anomalies by influence of\ntopographical variation.\n\nGeophysical anomalies of electric conductivity corrected from\ntopography and magnetic susceptibility for both grid-1 and grid-2\nstudy areas emphasized the identification of two areas with high\narchaeological potentials. These results that orientate archaeolog-\nical excavations allow exposing a fire-place in grid-1 area, and\na concentration of ceramic materials in grid-2 area.\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful to Funda\u00e7a?o de Amparo a?
