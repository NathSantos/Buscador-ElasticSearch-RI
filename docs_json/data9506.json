O interesse por este combust\u00edvel est\u00e1 \n\nrelacionado com uma nova tend\u00eancia: a procura de alternativas \u00e0s fontes de energia \n\nbaseadas em petr\u00f3leo. A sua utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1 associada a v\u00e1rios benef\u00edcios \n\nambientais, como a redu\u00e7\u00e3o da emiss\u00e3o de poluentes. No entanto, devido ao \n\nelevado custo associado \u00e0 sua mat\u00e9ria-prima usual, como os \u00f3leos vegetais \n\ncomest\u00edveis, o biodiesel n\u00e3o \u00e9 no momento atual economicamente vi\u00e1vel. Portanto, \n\nh\u00e1 uma necessidade de reduzir o pre\u00e7o final deste combust\u00edvel. Uma das formas de \n\nreduzir os custos ser\u00e1 a de se utilizarem mat\u00e9rias-primas mais baratas no processo \n\nde produ\u00e7\u00e3o, como \u00f3leos usados ou n\u00e3o comest\u00edveis. A principal caracter\u00edstica \n\ndessas mat\u00e9rias-primas mais baratas \u00e9 a baixa qualidade quando comparada com \n\nos \u00f3leos comest\u00edveis. Esta baixa qualidade est\u00e1 normalmente associada a um alto \n\nteor em \u00e1cidos gordos livres (AGL) e/ou \u00e1gua. Os AGLs presentes na mat\u00e9ria-prima \n\ndevem ser convertidos em biodiesel, tamb\u00e9m conhecido por \u00e9steres met\u00edlicos de \n\n\u00e1cidos gordos (Fatty Acid Methyl Esters: FAME), por uma rea\u00e7\u00e3o de esterifica\u00e7\u00e3o. A \n\nrea\u00e7\u00e3o de esterifica\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o pode ser promovida por catalisadores alcalinos, \n\ngeralmente aplicados na transesterifica\u00e7\u00e3o, como o NaOH ou o KOH. Os \n\ncatalisadores alcalinos na presen\u00e7a de AGLs levam \u00e0 forma\u00e7\u00e3o de sab\u00e3o, \n\nconsumindo o catalisador, diminuindo a sua atividade catal\u00edtica e tornando a \n\nsepara\u00e7\u00e3o dos produtos finais mais complexa. Apenas os catalisadores \u00e1cidos s\u00e3o \n\ncapazes de promover a rea\u00e7\u00e3o de esterifica\u00e7\u00e3o de AGLs. Os catalisadores \u00e1cidos \n\ns\u00e3o capazes de catalisar ambas as rea\u00e7\u00f5es, no entanto, a velocidade da rea\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ntransesterifica\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 cerca de 4000 vezes mais lenta do que quando se utilizam \n\ncatalisadores alcalinos [1,2], levando a longos tempos de rea\u00e7\u00e3o e, \n\nconsequentemente, custos elevados de produ\u00e7\u00e3o. Desta forma, existe uma \n\ncrescente necessidade de encontrar catalisadores alternativos que promovam tanto \n\na rea\u00e7\u00e3o de transesterifica\u00e7\u00e3o quanto a rea\u00e7\u00e3o de esterifica\u00e7\u00e3o em condi\u00e7\u00f5es mais \n\nfavor\u00e1veis. Atualmente, os l\u00edquidos i\u00f3nicos t\u00eam sido utilizados como uma alternativa \n\n\n\niv \n \n\naos catalisadores convencionais. Os l\u00edquidos i\u00f3nicos s\u00e3o sais fundidos compostos \n\npor um cati\u00e3o org\u00e2nico e um ani\u00e3o org\u00e2nico ou inorg\u00e2nico. No presente estudo \n\navalia-se a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do catalisador hidrogenossulfato de 1-metilimidaz\u00f3lio \n\n([HMIM][HSO4]) na produ\u00e7\u00e3o de biodiesel atrav\u00e9s da rea\u00e7\u00e3o de esterifica\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\n\u00e1cido oleico. A influ\u00eancia dos principais par\u00e2metros (tempo, temperatura, raz\u00e3o \n\nmolar metanol/\u00e1cido oleico e quantidade de catalisador) foi estudada atrav\u00e9s de uma \n\nmetodologia de superf\u00edcie de resposta conhecida por Box-Behnken Design (BBD), \n\navaliando duas repostas: a convers\u00e3o de \u00e1cido oleico e o conte\u00fado de FAMEs. \n\nConcluiu-se que os par\u00e2metros mais relevantes para ambas as respostas foram a \n\nraz\u00e3o molar entre os reagentes e a quantidade de catalisador. As condi\u00e7\u00f5es \u00f3timas \n\npara a convers\u00e3o foram determinadas como sendo 8 h, 110\u00b0C, 15:1 rela\u00e7\u00e3o molar \n\nmetanol/\u00e1cido oleico e uma quantidade de catalisador de 15% em massa, resultando \n\nnuma convers\u00e3o de 95% e para o conte\u00fado de FAMEs foram 8 h, 110 \u00b0C, uma raz\u00e3o \n\nmolar de 14:1 e uma dosagem de catalisador de 13,5% em peso, conduzindo a um \n\nconte\u00fado de \u00e9steres met\u00edlicos de \u00e1cidos gordos de 90%. Foram tamb\u00e9m \n\ndeterminados os par\u00e2metros cin\u00e9ticos da rea\u00e7\u00e3o. A energia de ativa\u00e7\u00e3o foi estimada \n\nem 6.8 kJ/mol e o fator pr\u00e9-exponencial em 0.0765 L\n2\n.mol\n\n-2\n.min\n\n-1\n. \n\nPalavras-chave: Produ\u00e7\u00e3o de biodiesel; Esterifica\u00e7\u00e3o; L\u00edquidos i\u00f3nicos; Metodologia \n\nde Superf\u00edcie de Resposta. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nv \n \n\nABSTRACT \n\nBiodiesel is a liquid fuel obtained from several renewable sources by \n\ntransesterification reaction of triglycerides. Its development is related to a new \n\ntendency: the search for alternatives to petroleum-based energy sources. Its \n\nutilization is associated with several environmental benefits, such as a reduction in \n\npollutants emissions. However, due to the high cost associated to its usual feedstock, \n\nsuch as edible vegetable oils, biodiesel is not economically viable. Therefore, there\u2019s \n\na requisite to decrease the final price of this fuel. The logical way is by introducing \n\ncheaper feedstock into the industrial production, such as non-edible feedstock or \n\nwaste cooking oil. The main characteristic of cheaper feedstock is the high content of \n\nfree fatty acids (FFAs) and/or water when compared to edible feedstock. FFAs \n\npresent on the feedstock must be converted into biodiesel, also referred to as fatty \n\nacid methyl esters (FAMEs), by an esterification reaction. The esterification reaction \n\ncannot be catalyzed by alkali catalyst, usually applied in the transesterification such \n\nas NaOH or KOH. Alkali catalysts in the presence of FFAs lead to the formation of \n\nsoap, consuming the catalyst, decreasing its catalytic activity and turning the \n\nseparation of the final products much more complex. Hence, only acidic catalysts are \n\nable to promote the esterification reaction of FFAs. Those acidic catalysts are able to \n\ncatalyze both reactions, however, the rate of the transesterification reaction is about \n\n4000 times slower than for the reactions promoted by alkali catalysts [1,2], leading to \n\nlong reaction times and, again, high costs. In this way, there is an increasing need to \n\nfind alternative catalysts that promote both the transesterification and the \n\nesterification reaction under adequate conditions. Thus, ionic liquids emerge as an \n\nalternative to conventional catalysts. Ionic liquids are molten salts composed of an \n\norganic or inorganic anion and an organic cation. The present study evaluated the \n\nuse of the catalyst 1-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate ([HMIM][HSO4]) in the \n\nproduction of biodiesel through the esterification reaction of oleic acid. The influence \n\nof the main parameters (time, temperature, molar ratio methanol/oleic acid and \n\ncatalyst dosage) on two responses (conversion of oleic acid and FAME content of the \n\n\n\nvi \n \n\nbiodiesel samples) were studied through a response surface methodology (RSM) \n\nknown as Box-Behnken Design (BBD). It was concluded that the most relevant \n\nparameters for both responses were the molar ratio between the reactants and the \n\ncatalyst dosage. The optimum conditions for the conversion were determined as \n\nbeing 8 h, 110 \u00b0C, 15:1 molar ratio methanol/oleic acid and a catalyst dosage of 15 \n\nwt%, resulting in a 95% conversion and for the FAME content were 8 h, 110 \u00b0C, 14:1 \n\nmolar ratio and a catalysts dosage of 13.5 wt%, leading to a content of 90%. The \n\nkinetics of the reaction were also studied. The activation energy was estimated as 6.8 \n\nkJ/mol and the pre-exponential factor as 0.0765 L\n2\n.mol\n\n-2\n.min\n\n-1\n.  \n\nKeywords: Biodiesel production; Esterification; Ionic liquids; Response Surface \n\nMethodology. \n\n  \n\n\n\nvii \n \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n \n\nLIST OF FIGURES ix \n\nLIST OF TABLES xii \n\nNOMENCLATURE xiv \n\n1.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES  \n\n1.1 Background \n\nSince the industrial revolution in the early 19\nth\n\n century, the demand for energy has \n\nincreased considerably. According to the International Energy Agency (2017) report, \n\nfrom 1971 to 2015, the total final consumption of energy doubled, with the \n\ntransportation sector being one of the major responsible for this boost, with a \n\nconsumption share that increased from 23% in 1971 to 29% in 2015. Furthermore, \n\nthe projection presented by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (2016) in the \n\nlast report affirms that, for the period of 2012 - 2040, the diesel consumption will \n\nshow the largest growth, comparing to all other transportation fuels [3,4]. \n\nThe rising demand for fuels, mainly for the transportation sector, allied with an \n\nincreasing concern for the environment, has been leading several researchers to look \n\nfor alternatives to petroleum-based energy sources. Hence, a new term emerges: \n\nBiofuels. A biofuel is defined as a liquid or gaseous fuel derived from biomass \n\nsources, such as wood, vegetation, organic residues, vegetable oils, amongst others \n\n[5,6]. \n\nBiofuels have several advantages over traditional fuels obtained from other sources. \n\nThey are obtained from renewable energy sources and have lower impact on the \n\nenvironment. Amongst the available biofuels, such as bioethanol, biogas and syngas, \n\nbiodiesel is a good alternative as energy source. Biodiesel has been greatly explored \n\nin the past decades, but the production process currently applied has several \n\ndrawbacks related to cost issues, environmental concerns, food competition, \n\namongst others.  \n\nHereof, searching for alternative routes to produce biodiesel is a contemporary \n\nconcern. Most of the focus is invested in finding new catalysts that allow overcoming \n\nthe disadvantages of the traditional production process. In this way, ionic liquids \n\n\n\n2 \n \n\nappear as possible substitutes, due to its characteristics that promote a greener \n\nprocess.  \n\n1.2 Objectives \n\n1.2.1 Main objective \n\nThe main objective of this work is to study the biodiesel production by applying ionic \n\nliquids as catalysts to the esterification reaction between oleic acid and methanol.  \n\n1.2.2 Specific objectives \n\n? Evaluate the effect of different ionic liquids over the conversion of the \n\nesterification reaction of oleic acid with methanol, for biodiesel production; \n\n? Estimate the optimal reaction conditions (reaction time, reaction temperature, \n\nmolar ratio between methanol and oleic acid and catalyst dosage) for the \n\nesterification reaction of oleic acid with methanol using a suitable ionic liquid, \n\nby applying a Response Surface Methodology (RSM) known as Box-Behnken \n\nDesign (BBD);  \n\n? Evaluate the reaction kinetics of the esterification reaction catalyzed by the \n\nchosen ionic liquid;  \n\n? Assess the performance of the selected ionic liquid in the catalysis of the \n\ntransesterification reaction between a waste cooking oil with high acidity value \n\nand methanol. \n\n  \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\n2. BIODIESEL  \n\nAmong the many biofuels known, biodiesel emerges as a promising replacement for \n\npetro diesel. Biodiesel can be defined as a fuel suitable for compression ignition \n\nengines that is formed by a mixture of fatty acids alkyl esters derived from oils or fats. \n\nIt can be obtained from a transesterification reaction of triglycerides or an \n\nesterification reaction of free fatty acids and it can be produced from a wide variety of \n\nraw materials [7,8]. \n\nBiodiesel has been explored in several locations, including USA, Brazil, and the \n\nEuropean Union, among others. Globally, the production increased from 15 thousand \n\nbarrels per day in 2000 to 289 thousand barrels per day in 2008. In 2011, the \n\nEuropean Union produced 22 million tons of biodiesel, against 9.5 million in 2009. \n\nThese numbers only highlight the importance of biodiesel as a fuel [7,9]. \n\n2.1 Advantages and disadvantages of biodiesel \n\nBiodiesel presents several advantages over diesel derived from petroleum. \n\nProperties of both fuels are very similar, allowing a mixture of biodiesel and diesel in \n\nany proportions and implying that it can be employed in diesel engines without major \n\nchanges, with the engine performance remaining practically unaltered. The storage \n\nand transportation of biodiesel is much safer when compared to regular diesel, due to \n\nits biodegradability, higher cetane number and higher flash point [7,10]. \n\nBiodiesel presents, in general, better characteristics than petrodiesel in combustion. \n\nThe unburned hydrocarbons can be reduced by 90% when applying biodiesel and \n\naromatic compounds emissions can be reduced by 75% to 90%. For CO2 emissions, \n\nthere is also a significant reduction, mainly when the entire life cycle of the oil is \n\nconsidered. Finally, particle emissions are lower and biodiesel can be obtained from \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\na wide range of renewable sources, such as vegetable oils, animal fats, and algae, \n\namong others [7,8,10]. \n\nHowever, the emissions of nitrogen oxides can be slightly higher. Also, the engine \n\nspeed and power are lower and the cloud and pour point is higher, decreasing the \n\nengine power by around 5% when compared to petrodiesel. Biodiesel production is \n\ncurrently more expensive than petrodiesel due to the high cost associated to \n\nfeedstock [10]. \n\n2.2 Raw materials for biodiesel production \n\nNowadays, biodiesel has a greater cost than petrodiesel due to the raw materials \n\nemployed. Traditionally, most processes apply edible vegetable oils, such as \n\nsoybean oil, rapeseed oil and palm oil [11]. Those oils have some advantages, \n\nmainly related to the fact that they do not require a pretreatment. On the other hand, \n\nthose oils have a high cost, leading to an expensive final product. Also, the use of \n\nsuch oils could generate competition with the food market, leading to issues related \n\nto food supply [10].  \n\nBesides edible oils, several other materials can be exploited for biodiesel production, \n\nsuch as nonedible oils, for instance jatropha oil, mahua oil, castor oil and cotton seed \n\noil [11,12]. Nonedible oils have some compounds in their structure that make them \n\nunsuitable for human consumption. There are several advantages related to using \n\nnonedible oils over edible oils, such as their reduced price, the fact that they won\u2019t \n\ncreate issues related to food supply, amongst other. The downside is that they are \n\nusually rich in free fatty acids, which for the traditional biodiesel production poses \n\nissues related to yield of the reaction and purification of products [13].   \n\nAnother possibility is the use of waste cooking oils (WCO), which is any oil that has \n\nbeen previously used for cooking or frying, and is, therefore, not suitable for \n\nconsumption anymore. The advantages of applying those oils are that its price is \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nmuch lower than refined oils, and likewise, there is no competition with the food \n\nmarket. Again, the major disadvantage of this feedstock is the high content of free \n\nfatty acids and moisture. The quality of the raw materials cited, nonedible oils and \n\nwaste cooking oil, could be increased by applying a number of pretreatments steps. If \n\nnot subjected to treatment, the content of free fatty acids could lead to a \n\nsaponification reaction, decreasing drastically the biodiesel yield and the downstream \n\nprocess would be more complex [9,10].  \n\nAnother alternative to vegetable oils is the use of algae. The advantages of algae are \n\nrelated to their fast growth rate, the high yield of oil produced per acre of plant (up to \n\n31 times higher than the obtained with other vegetable oils), the fact that they can be \n\nproduced all year around and that they are environmentally friendly. On the other \n\nhand, production of biodiesel applying algae brings some challenges, mainly related \n\nto the upstream and downstream process, such as algae dehydration, oil extraction \n\nand purification process [10,14]. \n\nFinally, another pointed solution for biodiesel feedstock is animal fat. The main \n\nadvantage of this feedstock is the availability and low price. On the other hand, the \n\ndisadvantages are related to the high content of free fatty acids, which would again \n\nrequire pretreatment, and the fact that it results in a biodiesel that cannot be fully \n\nemployed in lower temperatures, due to its higher viscosity. However there are \n\nstudies investigating how to improve the quality of biodiesel derived from animal fats \n\n[9]. \n\nTable 1 presents a comparison between the distribution of fatty acids in animal fat, \n\nedible and non-edible vegetable oil and waste cooking oils. The most common fatty \n\nacid in oils originated from plants are the palmitic (hexadecanoic  - C16:0), stearic \n\n(octadecanoic - C18:0), oleic (9(z)-octadecanoic - C18:1), linoleic (9(z)-12(z)-\n\noctadecanoic - C18:2) and linolenic (9(z)-12(z)-15(z)-octadecanoic - C18:3) [15].  \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nTable 1 - Fatty acid distribution among different feedstock. \n\nFeedstock Type \nFatty acid distribution (wt%) \n\nC14:0 C16:0 C18:0 C18:1 C18:2 C18:3 \n\nChicken fat Animal fat 3.1 19.82 3.06 37.62   \n\nTallow Animal fat 23.3 19.3 42.4 2.9 0.9 2.9 \n\nRapeseed oil Edible oil - 1 - 3 0 - 1 10 - 15 12 - 15 8 - 12 \n\nSunflower oil Edible oil - 5 - 8 2 - 6 15 - 40 30 \u2013 70 3 - 5 \n\nSoybean oil Edible oil - 6 - 10 2 - 5 20 - 30 50 - 60 5 - 11 \n\nJatropha oil Non-edible oil 14 - 15 0 - 13  34 - 45 14 - 15 0.3 \n\nCotton seed oil Non-edible oil  22 - 28 1 13 - 18  0.2 \n\nYellow grease WCO 2.43 23.24 12.96 44.32 6.97 0.67 \n\nBrown grease WCO 1.66 22.83 12.54 42.36 12.09 0.82 \n\nSource: adapted from Ambat, Srivastava and Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4. [12] \n\n2.3 Physical properties of biodiesel \n\nThe physical properties of biodiesel are compared to those of petroleum-based diesel \n\npresented in Table 2. The most important property of biodiesel is the kinetic viscosity, \n\nsince it is directly related to the fuel injection in the engine. The lower the viscosity, \n\nthe better is the injection operation. According to Table 2, it is clear that the biodiesel \n\nis a viable replacement for petroleum based diesel, since the viscosity of a regular \n\ndiesel fuel is in the range of 12 to 3.5 mm\n2\n/s and the viscosity for biodiesel produced \n\nfrom several sources are within that range. [10]. \n\nTable 2 - Physical properties of biodiesel from several sources and diesel fuel. \n\nVegetable oil \nmethyl ester \n\nViscosity \n(mm\u00b2/s) \n\nCetane \nnumber \n\nLower heating \nvalue (MJ/ton) \n\nFlash \nPoint (\u00b0C) \n\nDensity  \n\n(g/L) \n\nSulfur \n(wt %) \n\nPeanut 4.9 \na\n  54 33.6 176 0.883 - \n\nSoybean 4.5\n a\n 45 33.5 178 0.885 - \n\nBabassu 3.6 \na\n 63 31.8 127 0.879 - \n\nPalm 5.7 \na\n 62 33.5 164 0.880 - \n\nSunflower 4.6 \na\n 49 33.5 183 0.860 - \n\nRapeseed 4.2 \nb \n\n51-59.7 32.8 - 0.882 \nd \n\n- \n\nUsed rapeseed 9.48  53 36.7 192 0.895 0.002 \n\nUsed corn oil 6.23 \nc \n\n63.9 42.3 166 0.884 0.0013 \n\nDiesel Fuel 12-3.5 \nb \n\n51 35.5 - 0.830-0.840\nd \n\n- \n\nJIS-2D (gas oil) 2.8 \nc \n\n58 42.7 59 0.833 0.05 \na \nat 37.8\u00b0C; \n\nb \nat 40\u00b0C; \n\nc\n at 30\u00b0C; \n\nd\n at 15\u00b0C; Source: Fukuda, Kond, and Noda [8] \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nThe cetane number is a measurement of the ignition quality of the fuel. The higher it \n\nis, the shorter the ignition delay, implying that a higher cetane number leads to a fuel \n\nwith better quality. For biodiesel, as it can be seen on Table 2, the cetane number is \n\nslightly higher than for diesel due to the higher oxygen content of biodiesel. Usually, \n\nthe longer the fatty acid chain is, the higher cetane number of the resulting biodiesel \n\nwill be [16]. \n\nOther relevant properties are the cloud point and the pour point. Those properties are \n\nrelated to the applicability of the fluid in low temperatures. Biodiesel displays higher \n\ncloud point and pour point, which means that biodiesel is more difficult to be \n\nemployed in low temperatures than diesel [10]. Finally, biodiesel shows great \n\ncombustion efficiency, due to its oxygen content. Furthermore, biodiesel can extend \n\nthe life of diesel engine, due to its lubricating properties [10]. \n\n2.4 Methods for biodiesel production \n\nVegetable oils rich in triglycerides are a promising replacement to petroleum-based \n\ndiesel. The main issue with applying those oils as fuel is the high viscosity exhibited \n\nby them, which would require major changes in the regular diesel engine. Therefore, \n\nthe main objective for biodiesel production is to lower the viscosity of the employed \n\noils. The differences in the viscosities of oils and biodiesel can be easily observed in \n\nTable 3, where the properties of several vegetable oils are compared to the \n\nproperties of diesel fuel. By comparing the values of viscosity displayed on Table 3 to \n\nthose displayed on Table 2, it is very clear that the objective of lowering the viscosity \n\nof the oils is reached.  \n\nThere are several methods to approximate the properties of triglycerides-based fuels \n\nto diesel properties, such as pyrolysis, microemulsion, dilution and transesterification \n\n[8,16].  \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nTable 3 - Properties of diesel D2 and other vegetable oils. \n\nFuel type Heating value \n(MJ/kg) \n\nDensity  \n\n(kg/m\n3\n) \n\nViscosity at \n300k (mm\n\n2\n/s) \n\nCetane \nnumber \n\nDiesel D2  43.4 815 4.3 47.0 \n\nSunflower oil 39.5 918 58.5 37.1 \n\nCottonseed oil 39.6 912 50.1 48.1 \n\nSoybean oil 39.6 914 65.4 38.0 \n\nCorn oil 37.8 915 46.3 37.6 \n\nOpium poppy oil 38.9 921 56.1 - \n\nRapeseed oil 37.6 914 39.2 37.6 \n\nSource: Demirbas (2008) [10] \n\nTransesterification has shown to be a favorable reaction to obtain triglycerides \n\nderivatives (known as biodiesel) with properties close to those of diesel. The oils \n\nemployed might contain an amount of free fatty acids, which can be converted to \n\nbiodiesel through an esterification reaction. Both reactions \u2013 transesterification and \n\nesterification \u2013 are equilibrium reactions [8,17]. \n\n2.4.1 Esterification \n\nFree fatty acids are carboxylic acids and they are converted to esters by a \n\ncondensation reaction with alcohols, also known as esterification. The reaction can \n\nonly be accomplished if the equilibrium is driven towards product formation, such as \n\nwhen there is an excess of reactants or one of the products is continuously removed \n\nfrom the reaction media [18]. Figure 1 shows the general scheme for an esterification \n\nreaction. Carboxylic acid (1) reacts with an alcohol (2), giving rise to water (3) and an \n\nester (4). \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Scheme for the esterification reaction. \nSource: Andreani and Rocha (2012) [17] \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nThe mechanism in which the esterification reaction of carboxylic acids occurs is \n\ntetrahedral. The reaction happens in five steps, as shown on Figure 2. First, the \n\noxygen belonging to the carbonyl group of the carboxylic acid (1) is pronated by the \n\nacid catalyst (2), making the carbonyl group a much stronger electrophile (3). Then, \n\nthe electrophile undergoes 1,2-addition by the alcohol (4), giving origin to a \n\ntetrahedral intermediate (5). The proton from the alcohol is transferred to the OH \n\ngroup. Then, there\u2019s a 1,2-elimination of water, which leads to a protonated ester (6) \n\nand water (7). The protonated ester then loses the proton, regenerating the catalyst \n\n(2) and generating the ester (8) [19]. \n\n \n\nFigure 2 - Mechanism for the esterification of carboxylic acids. \nSource: Adapted from Zeng et al. (2012) [19]. \n\n2.4.2 Transesterification \n\nThe transesterification reaction is performed using oils rich in triglycerides with a \n\nshort chain alcohol, such as methanol or ethanol, in the presence of a catalyst. \n\nMethanol is widely used in most countries due to its low cost, although in a few \n\ncountries, such as Brazil, ethanol can be applied. Biodiesel obtained from \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\ntransesterification with methanol can also be referred as Fatty Acids Methyl Esters \n\n(FAMEs) [17].  \n\nFigure 3 shows a scheme for the transesterification reaction. The stoichiometry \n\ndictates that it is necessary 3 moles of alcohol (2) for each triglyceride (1) in order to \n\nachieve a stoichiometric conversion but it is common to use much higher molar ratios \n\nin order to force the reaction in the direction of product formation.  The reaction gives \n\nglycerol (3) as by-product and 3 moles of ester (4). It is an equilibrium reaction and \n\nthe reaction requires a catalyst. Usually, catalysts with an alkali character are \n\nemployed. If water or carboxylic acids (free fatty acids) are present under alkali \n\ncatalyzed reaction, it can lead to hydrolysis of the alcoholic ester and saponification \n\n[20]. \n\n \n\nFigure 3 - Scheme for the transesterification reaction. \nSource: Andreani and Rocha (2012) [17] \n\nThe mechanism for the transesterification reaction catalyzed by an acidic catalyst is \n\ndisplayed on Figure 4. This mechanism was proposed by Ishak et al. (2017). The \n\ncatalyst (2) promotes the transesterification reaction by donating a proton to the \n\ncarbonyl group of the triglyceride (1), turning it into a stronger electrophile (3). The \n\nelectrophile (3) then reacts with the short chain alcohol (4), through a nucleophilic \n\nsubstitution, forming molecules of diglyceride (6), esters (7) and a proton, which will \n\ncatalyze the next set of reactions [21]. The diglyceride will then be converted into \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nmonoglyceride, which will then be converted into glycerol. Each step gives rise to one \n\nmole of an ester. \n\n \n\nFigure 4 - Mechanism for the transesterification reaction of triglycerides. \nSource: Ishak et al. (2017) [21] \n\n2.4.3 Catalysts \n\nBoth reactions discussed in the previous section require a catalyst in order to achieve \n\na reaction time and reaction conversions that are suitable for industrial processes. \n\nThe most common processes use alkali catalysts; however, other catalysts can be \n\napplied, such as acidic catalysts and enzymes. \n\nAlkali catalysts can only catalyze the transesterification reaction. The most applied \n\nones are NaOH and KOH. The transesterification reaction catalyzed by a basic \n\ncatalyst has the advantage of being much faster than the acid-catalyzed reaction \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\n(about four thousand times faster), but the presence of even a small amount of water \n\nand/or free fatty acids can lead to a saponification reaction, consuming the catalyst \n\nand lowering the catalytic performance. It can also influence the downstream \n\nprocess, making the separation of the final product more complex. Some authors \n\nsuggest that the transesterification reaction under basic catalysis must be performed \n\nwith anhydrous refined oils with free fatty acids content lower than 0.5%, thus, \n\nrequiring the use of edible or refined feedstock. As already mentioned, edible \n\nfeedstock is expensive, leading to a final product with high prices, which is \n\neconomically non-viable [7,8,21].  \n\nOn the other hand, the acidic catalysts are able to promote both the esterification and \n\ntransesterification reactions, thus allowing the use of cheaper feedstock with higher \n\ncontent of Free Fatty Acids (FFA) and water. However, the employment of acidic \n\ncatalyst for the transesterification reaction has several disadvantages:  it is much \n\nslower than the basic catalyzed reaction and it requires a considerable amount of \n\nalcohol to shift the equilibrium towards product formation, usually a proportion of 30-\n\n150:1 moles of methanol to moles of triglycerides, for instance. Also, catalysts that \n\nare highly acidic can lead to equipment corrosion [17,21].  \n\nAnother possibility that has been studied is the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Lipases \n\ncan be used as catalysts for biodiesel production, having several advantages, for \n\ninstance the high selectivity and the use under mild conditions. Also, it is easier to \n\nrecover the glycerol obtained as byproduct and the FAMEs are simpler to purify. Yet, \n\nenzymes can be deactivated due to contamination of side products or even by \n\norganic solvents and they are usually expensive [22,23]. The methods discussed for \n\nbiodiesel production are summarized on Table 4. \n\nIn this way, the latest research has been focused on looking for alternative synthesis, \n\nmainly focusing on designing processes that allow the use of low-cost feedstock in \n\norder to decrease biodiesel price and turn biodiesel into a competitive fuel. Ionic \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\nliquids have been explored as an alternative to traditional catalysts, due to the fact \n\nthat they may overcome some of the drawbacks of the traditional methods [24]. \n\nTable 4 - Comparison of methods for Biodiesel production. \n\nMethod Catalyst Advantages Disadvantages \n\nAlkali \ncatalyzed \n\nKOH, \nNaOH, \n\nCarbonates \n\nIt is much faster; relative short \nreaction time, relative mild \n\nconditions. \n\nLeads to saponification in the \npresence of water, does not \n\ncatalyze the esterification \nreaction. \n\nAcid \ncatalyzed \n\nH2SO4 \n\nIt can catalyze both the \ntransesterification and the \n\nesterification reaction; Can be used \nwith low quality feedstock. \n\nReaction time is much longer \nand it requires a large amount of \nalcohol.

(2009) [25]; Andreani &amp; Rocha (2012) [17]; Fukuda et al. (2001) [8]; Ramos et \nal. (2011) [22]. \n\n  \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\n3. IONIC LIQUIDS \n\nIonic Liquids (ILs) can be defined as organic salts that are consisted of ions (an \n\norganic cation and an organic or inorganic anion) and, opposed to inorganic salts, \n\nremain liquid at room temperatures. The melting temperatures of those salts lay \n\nusually below 100\u00baC due to the presence of a delocalized charge and large ions, \n\ncausing packing to be difficult [17,26,27]. \n\nThere are several advantages related to the use of ionic liquids. Due to the \n\ninteractions between the anion and cation, they have negligible vapor pressure, a \n\ngood solubility in both organic and inorganic materials, they are non-flammable, have \n\na high catalytic activity and can be easily manipulated in order to achieve a specific \n\nproperty, just by changing the anion/cation combination, and thus being referred to \n\nas Task Specific Ionic Liquid (TSIL). This variation in the anion/cation combination is \n\nalso advantageous in terms of variety, since it can give origin to at least 1 million \n\nbinary ionic liquids and potentially 10\n18\n\n ternary ionic liquids, comparing to only 600 \n\norganic solvents. Besides, they are easily recyclable, can be used under mild \n\nconditions and produce less waste [13,17,27].  \n\nIonic liquids can exhibit acidic, basic or neutral characteristics. The ability to present \n\nan acidic character (which could be depicted as Br\u00f8nsted, Lewis or both) could be \n\nlinked to the cation and/or the anion and their character may influence greatly their \n\nability to catalyze a reaction. There are studies trying to connect the acidity of an \n\nionic liquid to its catalytic activity in biodiesel production [28,29]. \n\nThere is a high cost associated to ionic liquids, although, this high cost can be easily \n\nmanageable due to the fact that ionic liquids can be easily recovered and recycled \n\nback to the process. Usually, due to their low vapor pressure, distillation presents a \n\nsuitable option for the recovery process. However, when the system is sensitive to \n\ntemperature or other non-volatile compounds are mixed, there are other options in \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nterms of recovery, such as extraction with solvents, adsorption, separation applying \n\nmembranes, etc. [30]. \n\nIn biodiesel production, ionic liquids are able to reduce the number of reactions and \n\npurifications steps, decreasing the production cost and energy consumption \n\nthroughout the process. The majority of studies focus on the application of Br\u00f8nsted \n\nacidic ionic liquids to biodiesel production, since they usually show high catalytic \n\nactivity, although, a few publications report that basic ionic liquids require less \n\nreaction time and less temperature in biodiesel synthesis [13,27,29]. \n\n3.1 Ionic liquids applied to biodiesel production \n\nThe use of ionic liquids in biodiesel production has attracted a great attention from \n\nthe scientific community, since its use allows overcoming several issues related to \n\nthe traditional processes of biodiesel synthesis, such as the possibility of exploiting \n\nlow-cost feedstock, reducing environmental issues and the number of downstream \n\nsteps, among others [27]. There are several studies on the literature focusing on \n\nemploying ionic liquids as catalyst for biodiesel production. Table 5 summarizes a \n\nfew studies found on the literature. \n\nIn 2011, Elsheikh et al. [31] investigated ionic liquids containing an imidazolium ring \n\nin their cation for the transesterification reaction of crude palm oil with methanol. The \n\nILs investigated showed a high catalytic activity and a similar trend was observed for \n\nall ionic liquids when the amount of catalyst added was varied. The best catalyst was \n\n1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate [BMIM][HSO4], with which a conversion \n\nof 91.2% was achieved, with the optimal condition being 4.4 wt% of catalyst, crude \n\npalm oil/methanol ratio of 12:1, temperature of 160\u00baC for 120 min reaction time.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\nTable 5 - Review of reaction conditions found in literature. \n\nOil Ionic Liquid \n\nConditions \nConversion/ \n\nFAME \ncontent/yield \n\nRef. \nT(\u00baC)/ \n\nPower \n(W)  \n\nTime \n(h) \n\nMeOH/ \n\nOil ratio \n\nCat. \ndosage \n\nOleic Acid [BHSO3MIM][HSO4] 120\nd \n\n4 4:1 10%wt 97.7%\na \n\n[32] \n\nCrude \nPalm oil \n\n[BMIM][HSO4] 160\nd \n\n2 12:1 4.4%wt 91.2%\na \n\n[31] \n\nCastor Oil [HMIM][HSO4] 77\nd \n\n4 6:1 12%wt 89.8%\nb \n\n[33] \n\nOleic acid [BMIM][HSO4] 87\nd \n\n5.2 9:1 0.06 mole \n80.4%\n\na \n\n81.8%\nc \n\n[34] \n\nWaste oil [HO3S-PMIM][HSO4] 120\nd \n\n8 12:1 2g 96%\na \n\n[35] \n\nWaste oil [BMIM][HSO4] 160\nd \n\n1 15:1 5 wt% 95.6%\nc \n\n[36] \n\nOleic acid [HMIM][HSO4] - 6 4:1 3.5 mL 92.5%\na\n [37] \n\nPalm Oil [HSO3-BMIM][HSO4] 168\ne\n 6.43 11:1 9.17 wt% 98.9%\n\nb \n[38] \n\na\n Given in terms of conversion based in acidity; \n\nb \nGiven in terms of FAME content; \n\nc\n ester yield in mass \n\nbase; \nd\n Temperature; \n\ne\n Microwave power. \n\n \n\nIn 2013, Fauzi and Amin [34] performed a multi-objective optimization for the \n\nesterification reaction between oleic acid and methanol catalyzed by ionic liquid 1-\n\nbutyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate [BMIM][HSO4], evaluating simultaneously \n\nthe oleic acid conversion and the methyl oleate yield. An Artificial Neural Network \u2013 \n\nGeneric Algorithm (ANN\u2013GA) was applied to optimize the main reaction variables: \n\ntemperature, reaction time, molar ratio between methanol and oleic acid and the \n\ncatalyst dosage. They found that the optimal combination was a temperature of 87\u00b0C, \n\nreaction time of 5.2 h, molar ratio alcohol/oil of 9:1 and a catalyst loading of 0.06 \n\nmoles, leading to an oleic acid conversion of 80.4% and a methyl oleate yield of \n\n81.8%. \n\nAlso in 2013, Liu et al. [35] studied the reaction between waste cooking oil and \n\nmethanol, applying ionic liquids that depicted Br\u00f8nsted acidity. They tested 10 \n\ndifferent catalysts, including sulfuric acid. The best result was obtained with the ionic \n\nliquid 1-(3-sulfonic acid)propyl-3-methylimidazole hydrogen sulfate \n\n[HO3SPMIM][HSO4]. The best condition found was a reaction temperature of 120 \u00b0C, \n\nmolar ratio between methanol and oil of 12:1, catalyst loading of 2 g and a reaction \n\ntime of 8 h, leading to a 96% conversion. The same conditions were applied to acidic \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\noils, which were prepared by adding oleic acid in different proportions to the raw \n\nmaterial, and again, the conversion was over 90%. The recyclability was also \n\naddressed, and after 6 subsequent runs, no obvious reduction in the catalytic activity \n\nof the IL was detected. \n\nIn 2014, Li et al. [32] investigated seven ionic liquids to determine their applicability \n\nand catalytic activity in biodiesel production. They studied the esterification reaction \n\nbetween oleic acid and methanol. Their conclusion was that the higher catalytic \n\nactivity was connected to the anion\u2019s acidity, and that the stronger it is, the higher the \n\nmethyl oleate yield will be. In their work, they found that 1?sulfobutyl?3?\n\nmethylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate [BHSO3MIM][HSO4] was the best catalyst and \n\nthe optimal condition was 120 \u00baC, 4 hour reaction, methanol/oleic acid ratio 4:1 and a \n\nconcentration of catalyst of 10 wt%. They also studied the recyclability of the ionic \n\nliquid, and they only noticed a slight decrease on conversion after eighth consecutive \n\nruns. \n\nIn 2015, Xu et al. [33] compared the catalytic activity of the ionic liquid 1-\n\nmethylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate ([HMIM][HSO4]) with the catalysts 1-butyl-3-\n\nmethylimidazolium hydroxide ([BMIM][OH]), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and \n\nconcentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4).   Although results showed that for the \n\ntransesterification reaction between castor oil and methanol, the catalyst NaOH \n\npresented the best results, the ionic liquid 1-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate \n\n[HMIM][HSO4] displayed a very similar trend, so due to its advantages compared to \n\nthe traditional catalyst, this ionic liquid was chosen for further studies. They run a \n\nscreening test to study out of the 4 factors (temperature, time, and molar ratio \n\nmethanol/oil and catalyst dosage) which factors were significant in the reaction \n\nconversion. They found that the reaction time was not an important factor and carried \n\nout the experiments with the remainder factors to the optimal conditions for the \n\nreaction, using a response surface methodology. They concluded that the optimal \n\nconditions were molar ratio methanol/oil of 6:1, reaction time of 4 h, temperature of \n\n77 \u00baC and a catalyst dosage of 12 wt%.  \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\nAlso in 2015, Ullah et al. [36] studied the transesterification reaction between waste \n\npalm cooking oil with methanol in a two-step process. The first step, an esterification \n\nreaction, was catalyzed by an ionic liquid, in order to decrease the acidity of the \n\nwaste oil. The second stage was the utilization of KOH to catalyze the \n\ntransesterification reaction. Three ionic liquids were tested and 1-butyl-3-\n\nmethylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate [BMIM][HSO4] displayed the best results. The \n\nbest condition for the first stage was a concentration of catalyst of 5 wt%, a molar \n\nratio between methanol and waste oil of 15:1, reaction time of 60 min and a \n\ntemperature of 160\u00b0C. The final yield observed applying the determined condition for \n\nthe first stage and followed by the transesterification with the KOH catalyst resulted in \n\nan overall yield of 95.7% [36]. \n\nIn 2015, Sun et al. [37] studied the esterification reaction of oleic acid and methanol \n\nusing the catalyst 1-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate [HMIM][HSO4]. The \n\noptimized reaction conditions were 4:1 molar ratio of methanol/oleic acid, catalyst \n\ndosage of 3.5 mL and a reaction time of 6h, leading to a conversion of 92.5%. After 9 \n\nreuse cycles, the conversion was still above 85%. \n\nIn 2018, Ding et al. [38] investigated the transesterification reaction of palm oil and \n\nmethanol. Three synthesized ionic liquids were studied in order to determine their \n\ncatalytic activity, followed by a single factor experiment to investigate the effect of \n\nseveral parameters on the reaction and then a RSM to optimize those factors. The \n\nbest catalyst was the ionic liquid [HSO3-BMIM][HSO4] and the optimum condition was \n\na methanol/oil ratio of 11:1, a ionic liquid dosage of 9.17 wt%, a microwave power of \n\n168 W and a reaction time of 6.43h, leading to a yield of 98.9%.  \n\n3.2 Kinetic studies of esterification reaction  \n\nThe determination of the kinetic parameters of the esterification reaction of FFAs is \n\nalso interesting, as it allows a better understanding of the suitability of a determined \n\ncatalyst for biodiesel production. Normally, the main studied kinetic parameter is the \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\nactivation energy (Ea), defined as the minimum energy required for the reaction to \n\ntake place. Only when the reactants collide with this minimum energy is that the \n\nproducts are formed [39,40]. Also, the activation energy is a measure of how the \n\nreaction rate is influenced by the temperature. Reactions that have a small activation \n\nenergy (below 10 kJ/mol) have a little dependency on temperature, while reactions \n\nwith high activation energies (above 60 kJ/mol) have a strong dependency on \n\ntemperature [39]. Therefore, the lower the activation energy, the easier it is to turn \n\nreactants into products. Using a catalyst is a practical way to decrease the activation \n\nenergy, as catalysts work by providing a different pathway for the reaction to occur \n\nwith lower activation energy. The catalyst has no effect on the reaction equilibrium, \n\nand therefore the equilibrium is not impacted. Also, the catalyst is always \n\nregenerated at the end of the process [39]. There are several studies on the literature \n\nthat focuses on the estimation of the activation energy of both the esterification and \n\nthe transesterification reactions for biodiesel production. The main studies are \n\nsummarized on Table 6. \n\nTable 6 - Review of kinetic studies regarding biodiesel production. \n\nFeedstock Alcohol Order\n \n\nReaction type Catalyst \nTemperature \n\nrange (K) \n\nActivation \n\nEnergy \n\n(kJ/mol) \n\nRef. \n\nOleic acid MeOH 1\nst\n Esterification [BMIM][FeCl4] 313 \u2013 343 17.97 [41] \n\nWaste plum \n\nstone \nMeOH 1\n\nst\n Esterification H2SO4 313 - 333 \n\n13.20 - \n\n11.55\na \n\n[42] \n\nOleic acid EtOH 2\nnd \n\nEsterification H2SO4 348 \u2013 393 36.62 [43] \n\nPalm fatty \nacids \n\nMeOH 1\nst \n\nEsterification \n\nH2SO4 \n\n403 - 433 \n\n6.53 \u2013 \n15.05\n\na \n\n[44] \n\nCH?SO?OH \n3.78 \u2013 \n10.12\n\na \n\nPalm oil MeOH \n\n1\nst \n\nEsterification H2SO4 \n\n328 - 338 \n\n75.3 \n\n[45] \n2\n\nnd \nTransesterif.

The conditions applied were a molar ratio methanol/oleic acid of 22:1, 3 \n\nmmol of catalyst loading and a total reaction time of 3.6 h, with sampling every 36 \n\nmin. The temperature was varied from 40 to 70\u00b0C. The change in oleic acid \n\nconcentration was evaluated by titration with a KOH solution. They arrived at the \n\nconclusion that the reaction follows pseudo-first order kinetics and estimated the \n\nactivation energy as 17.97 kJ/mol and a pre-exponential factor as 181.62 min\n-1\n\n [41]. \n\nKosti? et al. (2016) studied the esterification reaction of waste plum stone with \n\nmethanol applying sulfuric acid as catalyst. The study was carried out under variation \n\nof catalyst loading, methanol/oil ratio, and temperature, modeling the reaction as a \n\npseudo-first order. They concluded that the activation energy suffers a slight \n\ndecrease when the catalyst dosage increases. The catalyst loading of 0.049 mol/dm\n3\n \n\nleads to an activation energy of 13.20 kJ/mol, whereas increasing the catalyst loading \n\nto 0.172 mol/dm\n3\n leads to an activation energy of 11.55 kJ/mol, that represents a \n\nvery small decrease [42]. \n\nNeumann et al. (2016) examined the esterification reaction of oleic acid with ethanol \n\nusing sulfuric acid as catalyst. They approached the variation of the concentration of \n\noil by a second order reaction, arriving at an activation energy of 36.62 kJ/mol and a \n\npre-exponential factor of 4.72 x 10\n2\n m\n\n3\nmol\n\n-1\ns\n\n-1 \n[43]. \n\nAranda et al. (2008) studied the esterification reaction of palm fatty acids with \n\nmethanol applying several acidic catalysts. The two catalysts that presented the best \n\nresults were sulfuric acid and methanesulfonic acid. The reaction promoted by both \n\ncatalysts was modeled as a first order reaction related to the oil. They varied the \n\nconcentration of the catalysts and the temperature, and they found out that the \n\nactivation energy decreases as the catalyst loading increases. For a 0.01wt% \n\ncatalyst loading, the activation energy was found as 15.05 kJ/mol for the reaction \n\ncatalyzed by sulfuric acid and 10.12 kJ/mol for the reaction catalyzed by \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\nmethanesulfonic acid. Increasing the catalyst loading to 0.05 wt% led to activation \n\nenergies of 6.53 kJ/mol (sulfuric acid) and 3.785 kJ/mol (methanesulfonic acid) [44]. \n\nJansri et al. (2011) investigated the reaction of palm oil with methanol in a two-stage \n\nprocess: esterification reaction of the FFAs with sulfuric acid as catalyst followed by a \n\ntransesterification reaction of the triglycerides with sodium hydroxide. The overall \n\norder of the esterification was assumed as being first order, while for the \n\ntransesterification a second order reaction. The temperature was varied from 55 to \n\n65\u00b0C. They arrived at the activation energy of 75.3 kJ/mol for the esterification \n\nreaction. For the transesterification reaction, they estimated the activation energies \n\nfor each step of the reaction: conversion of triglycerides (TGL) into diglyceride (DG) \n\n(1.45 kJ/mol), diglyceride into monoglyceride (MG) (328 kJ/mol) and monoglyceride \n\ninto glycerol (GL) (89.35 kJ/mol) [45]. \n\nUllah et al. (2017) studied the transesterification reaction between waste cooking oil \n\nand methanol with ionic liquid 3-methyl-1-(4-sulfo-butyl)-benzimidazolium \n\ntrifluoromethanesulfonate [BSMBIM][CF3SO3]. They simplified the reaction by \n\nignoring the intermediates of the transesterification reaction, modeling the reaction as \n\na first order. The temperature range studied was from 80 to 140\u00b0C and they \n\nestimated an activation energy of 19.24 kJ/mol [46].  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\n4. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION AND PROCEDURES  \n\n4.1 Chemicals and raw materials \n\nAll the reagents used for biodiesel production and for quality control analysis were at \n\nleast of analytical grade. Oleic acid, tech 90%, was obtained from ThermoFisher \n\n(Germany). The reagents obtained from Sigma Aldrich (Switzerland) included the 5 \n\nionic liquids: 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate, 1-butyl-3-\n\nmethylimidazolium methyl sulfate, 1-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate, 1-butyl-3-\n\nmethylimidazolium methanesulfonate and tributylmethylammonium methyl sulfate \n\nand the Supelco 37 FAME mixture.

The vessel was immersed in a bath with \n\nparaffin, in an automatic heating plate under determined temperature and agitation, \n\ncoupled with a reflux condenser, as shown in Figure 5. When the pre- determined \n\nreaction time was achieved, the vessel was removed from the bath and it was \n\nimmersed in cool water to stop the reaction. The mixture was transferred to \n\ncentrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 20 minutes at 3000 rpm and then stored at 4\u00b0C \n\nuntil the organic and the aqueous phases were completely separated and ready to be \n\nsplitted, as displayed in Figure 6. Both phases were stored in vials at 4\u00b0C waiting for \n\nfurther analysis, as displayed in Figure 7.  \n\n \nFigure 5 \u2013 Experimental set up for the esterification reaction: 1: heating plate with temperature and \n\nagitation control; 2: paraffin bath; 3: condenser for methanol reflux.  \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\n \nFigure 6 - Layers separated and ready to be split.1 (bottom layer): organic phase containing mainly \n\nbiodiesel and unreacted oleic acid; 2 (upper layer): aqueous phase containing mainly water, unreacted \nmethanol and ionic liquid.  \n\n \nFigure 7 \u2013 Visual appearance of the separated layers. \n\n \n \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\n4.4 Conversion measurements  \n\nAcid value determination was performed using a methanolic standardized KOH \n\nsolution, according to the EN 14104 standard procedure [49].

(\n?? ???\n\n? ?????????\n) =  \n\n???? ? ???? ? ?????\n??????????\n\n (1) \n\nWhere ???? is the volume of the KOH solution used in the titration, in mL,  ???? is the \n\nconcentration of the KOH solution, in mol/L,  ????? is the molecular weight of KOH, \n\nwhich is 56.1 g/mol,  ?????????? is the oleic acid/biodiesel mass measured, in g. \n\nThe conversion was then measured by comparing the acid value of the oleic acid to \n\nthe acid value of the final product, according to equation (2). \n\n??????????, ?(%) =\n (??????? ???? ?  ??????????? )\n\n ??????? ????\n\u00d7 100 (2) \n\nWhere  ? is the conversion of the oleic acid (%);  ??????? ???? is the acid value for the \n\noleic acid and  ???????????  is the acid value for the biodiesel, both in mg of KOH/g of \n\nsample. \n\n4.5 Characterization of biodiesel \n\n4.5.1 FAME content by Gas Chromatography  \n\nChromatography analysis was performed to measure qualitatively and quantitatively \n\nthe fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) content in the obtained biodiesel samples. This \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\nexperimental determinations was performed respecting the EN 14103 standard [50]. \n\nThe samples for chromatographic analysis were prepared in the following way: \n\naround 250 mg of biodiesel were measured in an analytical balance using a \n\nmicropipette and a 10 mL flask. Then, 5 mL of methyl heptadecanoate internal \n\nstandard solution, with a known concentration of around 10 mg/mL, were added. The \n\nsample was dried by adding a small amount of anhydrous sodium sulfate; the \n\nsolution was agitated and left standing until clarification. The volume of sample \n\ninjected in the GC equipment was 1 \u00b5L.  \n\nThe operation conditions used for GC analysis were a helium flow (carrier gas) of 1 \n\nmL/min and an initial oven temperature of 50\no\nC, which was held for 1 min. Then, a \n\nfirst ramp was done up to 200\no\nC at 25\n\no\nC/min rate and a second ramp up to 230\n\no\nC \n\nwith a 3\no\nC/min rate, which was held for 23 min, leading to a total running time of 40 \n\nmin. Injection temperature was 250 \no\nC, split ratio 1:25 and detector temperature \n\n250\u00b0C.  \n\nThe  identification of each FAME compound present in biodiesel samples was \n\ndetermined by comparison of the obtained retention times of each standard obtained \n\nby performing an analysis of a Supelco 37 component  standard FAME mix, using the \n\nsame GC-FID equipment under the same operation conditions.  Figure 8  displays \n\nthe elution order of each FAME in the mixture, as appointed by previously published \n\nwork from Agilent Technologies [51]. This elution order was used to identify each \n\nFAME in the analysis performed in the equipment used. The column used for \n\nobtaining the chromatogram displayed on Figure 8 is a DB WAX column, which has a \n\nsimilar packing and the same dimensions as the column used in this work (a \n\nSupelcowax 10), which allows comparison of the results obtained in both. It is \n\nimportant to notice the similarity of the elution order for all the components. The \n\nchromatogram displayed on Figure 9 is the chromatogram obtained for the same \n\nsample in the ESTiG equipment, using the operation conditions described in the \n\nbeginning of this section. Table 8 displays the retention time for each of the FAMEs, \n\nas well with the peak number used in the chromatogram, the name and the ID of the \n\ncomponent. These retention times were used to identify the presence of each FAME \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\nin the biodiesel samples, as exemplified on Figure 10. After the peaks were identified, \n\nthe total area of the peaks identified as FAMEs was calculated. \n\n \nFigure 8 - Chromatogram for the 37 Component FAME mix from Supelco in a DB WAX column. \n\nSource: David, Sandra and Vickers (2005) [51]. \n\n \nFigure 9 - Chromatogram for 37 Component FAME mix obtained in our equipment: elution order is the \n\nsame as the published work from Supelco. \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\nTable 8 - Elution order; peak name, peak ID and retention time for 37 Component FAME mix. \n\nPeak \nnumber \n\nPeak name Peak ID \nRetention time \n\n(min) \n\n1 Butyric acid methyl ester C4:0 3.904 \n\n2 Caproic acid methyl ester C6:0 5.109 \n\n3 Caprylic acid methyl ester C8:0 6.264 \n\n4 Capric acid methyl ester C10:0 7.319 \n\n5 Undecanoic acid methyl ester C11:0 7.852 \n\n6 Lauric acid methyl ester C12:0 8.429 \n\n7 Tridecanoic acid methyl ester C13:0 9.071 \n\n8 Myristic acid methyl ester C14:0 9.818 \n\n9 Myristoleic acid methyl ester C14:1 10.171 \n\n10 Pentadecanoic acid methyl ester C15:0 10.692 \n\n11 cis-10-Pentadecanoic acid methyl ester C15:1 11.116 \n\n12 Palmitic acid methyl ester C16:0 11.740 \n\n13 Palmitoleic acid methyl ester C16:1 12.095 \n\n14 Heptadecanoic acid methyl ester C17:0 12.942 \n\n15 cis-10-Heptadecanoic acid methyl ester C17:1 13.362 \n\n16 Stearic acid methyl ester C18:0 14.345 \n\n17,18 \nOleic acid methyl ester,  \n\nElaidic acid methyl ester \nC18:1 (c+t) 14.723 \n\n19,20 \nLinoleic acid methyl ester,  \n\nLinolelaidic acid methyl ester \nC18:2 (c+t) 15.489 \n\n21 gamma-Linolenic acid methyl ester C18:3n6 16.039 \n\n22 Linolenic acid methyl ester C18:3n3 16.609 \n\n23 Arachidic acid methyl ester C20:0 17.648 \n\n24 cis-11-Eicosenoic acid methyl ester C20:1 18.110 \n\n25 cis-11,14-Eicosadienoic acid methyl ester C20:2 19.153 \n\n26 cis-8,11,14-Eicosatrienoic acid methyl ester C20:3n6 19.711 \n\n27 Heneicosanoic acid methyl ester C21:0 19.838 \n\n28 cis-11,14,17-Eicosatrienoic acid methyl ester C20:3n3 20.449 \n\n29 Arachidonic acid methyl ester C20:4n6 20.757 \n\n30,31 \ncis-5,8,11,14,17-Eicosapentaenoic acid methyl ester, \n\nBehenic acid methyl ester \nC20:5n3 + \n\nC22:0 \n22.295 \n\n32 Erucic acid methyl ester C22:1 23.038 \n\n33 cis-13,16-Docosadienoic acid methyl ester C22:2 24.718 \n\n34 Tricosanoic acid methyl ester C23:0 25.566 \n\n35 Lignoceric acid methyl ester C24:0 29.773 \n\n36 cis-4,7,10,13,16,19-Docosahexanoic acid methyl ester C22:6n3 31.001 \n\n37 Nervonic acid methyl ester C24:1 31.352 \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10 - GC-FID chromatogram obtained from a biodiesel sample. \n\nThe FAME content was determined according to equation (3). \n\n?

FT-IR analysis helps to understand whether the reactants are being \n\nconverted into the desired products. FTIR spectra were obtained on ABB Inc. FTIR, \n\nmodel MB3000, (Quebec, Canada) in transmittance mode by using a Miracle single \n\nreflection horizontal ATR accessory from Pike Technologies (Madison, WI, USA). \n\n\n\n30 \n \n\nSpectra were recorded between 650 and 4000 cm\n-1\n\n at a resolution of 16 cm\n-1\n\n and \n\ncumulative 32 scans. Spectra were acquired using the software Horizon MB v.3.4.  \n\n4.6 Experimental design  \n\nTo estimate the optimal conditions, 4 factors were studied. The chosen factors were \n\nreaction time (h), reaction temperature (\u00b0C), molar ratio between methanol and oleic \n\nacid (mol/mol) and the amount of catalyst added to the system (%wt), in relation to \n\nthe mass of oleic acid. A response surface methodology (RSM) was employed, \n\nknown as Box-Behnken Design (BBD) [52]. Table 9 describes the 4 parameters \n\nchosen, the code applied and the 3 levels used. \n\n \n\nTable 9 - Levels chosen for Box-Behnken Design. \n\nParameter Code -1 0 +1 \n\nTime (h) A 4 6 8 \n\nTemperature (\u00baC) B 80 95  110  \n\nMolar ratio methanol/oleic acid C 5:1 10:1 15:1 \n\nCatalyst dosage (%wt) D 5 10 15 \n\nThe methodology estimates that 27 runs are adequate to understand the influence of \n\neach factor on the response. The design matrix in coded and in real values is \n\ndisplayed on Table 10. Each run was carried out accordingly to the generic \n\nesterification procedure presented in section 4.3. Two responses were evaluated: the \n\nconversion of oleic acid, according to the procedure described in section 4.4, and the \n\nFAME content, according to the procedure described in section 4.5.1. \n\nThe methodology allows fitting a quadratic mathematical model that describes the \n\nrelationship between the parameters and each response. The generic formula for the \n\nmathematical model is given by equation (4). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\nTable 10 - Experimental conditions applied for each run, in coded values and in real values. \n\nRun \n\nParameters  \n\nCoded values Real values \n\nA B C D \nTime \n(h) \n\nTemperature \n(\u00b0C) \n\nMolar Ratio \nMeOH/OA \n\nCatalyst \nDosage (wt%) \n\n1 -1 1 0 0 4 110 10 10 \n\n2 -1 0 0 -1 4 95 10 5 \n\n3 0 0 0 0 6 95 10 10 \n\n4 0 0 -1 -1 6 95 5 5 \n\n5 -1 0 -1 0 4 95 5 10 \n\n6 0 -1 1 0 6 80 15 10 \n\n7 0 1 0 1 6 110 10 15 \n\n8 1 1 0 0 8 110 10 10 \n\n9 0 1 1 0 6 110 15 10 \n\n10 0 -1 -1 0 6 80 5 10 \n\n11 1 0 -1 0 8 95 5 10 \n\n12 0 1 0 -1 6 110 10 5 \n\n13 -1 0 1 0 4 95 15 10 \n\n14 1 0 0 -1 8 95 10 5 \n\n15 0 -1 0 -1 6 80 10 5 \n\n16 0 0 1 1 6 95 15 15 \n\n17 0 0 1 -1 6 95 15 5 \n\n18 1 -1 0 0 8 80 10 10 \n\n19 0 1 -1 0 6 110 5 10 \n\n20 1 0 0 1 8 95 10 15 \n\n21 0 0 0 0 6 95 10 10 \n\n22 0 0 -1 1 6 95 5 15 \n\n23 -1 -1 0 0 4 80 10 10 \n\n24 -1 0 0 1 4 95 10 15 \n\n25 1 0 1 0 8 95 15 10 \n\n26 0 0 0 0 6 95 10 10 \n\n27 0 -1 0 1 6 80 15 15 \n\n \n\n? =  ?0 + ? ?? ??\n\n4\n\n?=1\n\n+ ? ??? ??\n2\n\n4\n\n?=1\n\n+ ? ??? ?? ??\n?<?\n\n  (4) \n\nWhere Y is the response, in this case either the oleic acid conversion or the FAME \n\ncontent, ?0 is the intercept coefficient, ?? are the linear terms, ??? the quadratic terms, \n\n???the interaction terms and ?? and ?? are the independent factors, which are \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\ndisplayed in Table 6. The values for each coefficient can be obtained by multiple \n\nlinear regression and by maximizing the equation it is possible to obtain the optimal \n\nconditions for each of the responses separately. \n\n \n\n4.7 Kinetic study  \n\nThe procedure was similar to the one for the esterification reaction, presented on \n\nsection 4.3. Throughout the reaction, in pre-determined times (0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, \n\n180, 240, 300, 360, 420 and 480 min), 1 mL of sample was removed from the vessel \n\nusing a micropipette and stored in a 2 mL flask at 4 \u00b0C, waiting for further analysis. \n\nThe conversion was determined by acid value decrease, as stated on section 4.4. \n\nThe kinetic study was performed for different reaction temperatures (70, 80, 90, 100 \n\nand 110\u00b0C) with the goal of establishing the activation energy. \n\n4.8 Transesterification study \n\nThe procedure was similar to the general esterification reaction. In this specific case, \n\nthe oleic acid was substituted by a mixture of oleic acid and a used vegetable oil. The \n\nmass proportion in which the oil and the acid were blended varied in each \n\nexperiment. The proportions are appointed in Table 11. The factors were set up to \n\nthe optimum determined for the esterification, except for the quantity of methanol \n\nadded, which was added in a proportion of 20 mol of methanol/mol of triolein (it was \n\nconsidered that the mixture was only composed by triolein). This approach regarding \n\nthe amount of methanol was chosen as it would allow a better comparison amid the \n\nresults obtained in each run. \n\nTable 11 \u2013 Experimental conditions for transesterification reaction. \n\nRun \nAmount of oleic \n\nacid (wt%) \nAmount of oil \n\n(wt%) \nTemperature \n\n(\u00b0C) \nCatalyst \n\ndosage (wt%) \nMolar ratio \n\nMeOH/triolein  \n\nT1 80 20 110 15 20 \nT2 60 40 110 15 20 \nT3 50 50 110 15 20 \nT4 40 60 110 15 20 \nT5 20 80 110 15 20 \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\n5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n5.1 Preliminary ionic liquid screening \n\nThe catalytic activities of five ionic liquids in the esterification reaction of oleic acid \n\nwere compared. The goal was to understand the influence of the cation and the \n\nanion on the catalytic activity of the ionic liquid and then choose the most suitable \n\none for biodiesel production. In order to do so, several experiments were carried out \n\nunder the same reaction conditions. The conditions applied were chosen based on \n\nprevious studies done in our research group [53] and were as follows: 6 h reaction \n\ntime, reaction temperature of 90\u00baC, catalyst loading of 10 wt% and a methanol/oleic \n\nacid ratio of 10:1. Table 12 presents the obtained results and are displayed on Figure \n\n11 for better interpretation.  \n\nTable 12 \u2013 Experimental results for ionic liquid screening.  \n\nIonic Liquid Code \nAcidity (mg KOH/g) Oleic Acid \n\nConversion \n(%) \n\nInitial Final \n\n1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium methyl sulfate \n[BMIM][MeSO4] \n\n1 183.74 37.75 79.45 \n\n1-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate  \n\n[HMIM][HSO4] \n2 183.74 21.10 88.52 \n\n1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate \n[BMIM][HSO4] \n\n3 183.74 41.03 77.66 \n\n1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium methanesulfonate \n\n[BMIM][CH3SO4] \n4 183.74 149.98 18.38 \n\nTributylmethylammonium methyl sulfate  \n\n[TBMA][MeSO4] \n5 183.74 155.47 15.39 \n\nThe order of catalytic activity of the ionic liquids was 2 > 1 > 3 >> 4 > 5, under the \n\nused conditions. The ionic liquids 1, 3 and 4 comprised the same cation (1-butyl-3-\n\nmethylimidazolium), and the results differed greatly from ionic liquid 4. This may \n\nindicate that the acidity of the methanesulfonate anion is very low. On the other hand, \n\nthe results obtained with catalysts 1 and 3 are very close, indicating that the catalytic \n\nactivity of those two catalysts may also be similar. Comparing ionic liquids 2 and 3, \n\nwhich display the same hydrogen sulfate anion but containing a different cation, the \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\nresults may indicate that the cation plays an important role on the catalytic activity, as \n\nthe change in the cation resulted in a higher conversion. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 11 - Catalyst screening. Conditions: 6h, 90\u00b0C, 10:1 molar ratio and 10wt% catalyst dosage. \n\nFinally, by comparing ionic liquids 1 and 5, which have the same anion and a \n\ndifferent cation, there\u2019s a huge difference in the conversion, indicating that the cation \n\nbased on an imidazole ring has a stronger acidity and therefore catalytic activity.  The \n\ncatalyst 1-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate [HMIM][HSO4]  2 was identified, from \n\nthose analyzed, as the most suitable catalyst for biodiesel production through \n\nesterification reaction. Therefore, this ionic liquid was chosen for further studies.  \n\nFigure 12 presents the structure of the ionic liquid [HMIM][HSO4]. \n\n \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 12 - Structure of ionic liquid 1-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate. \n\n5.2 Experimental design \n\nAfter choosing the ionic liquid 1-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate [HMIM][HSO4], \n\noptimization for the esterification reaction was performed based on a Response \n\nSurface Methodology (RSM).  This kind of methodology is based on a set of \n\nmathematical and statistical techniques that intends to fit a non-linear equation to the \n\nexperimental data, in such a way that this equation is able to describe the \n\nrelationship between the studied parameters and the response and make statistical \n\nprevisions [54]. Compared to one-variable-at-time methodologies, where the \n\ninfluence of only one factor is monitored at a time while others remain fixed, response \n\nsurface methodologies have the advantage of a small number of runs, meaning that \n\nRSM is time and cost efficient [54].  \n\nAmongst the available RSM, the design chosen was the Box-Behnken Design (BBD). \n\nAccording to Bezerra et al (2008) [54]: \n\n\u201cBox and Behnken suggested how to select points from the three-level factorial \narrangement, which allows the efficient estimation of the first- and second-order \ncoefficients of the mathematical model. These designs are, in this way, more efficient \nand economical then their corresponding 3k designs, mainly for a large number of \nvariables\u201d.  \n\nThe requirements of such design is that the factors must be adjusted in three levels  \n\n(-1, 0 and +1), equally spaced. The experimental points are located on a hyper \n\nsphere, being equally distant from the central point. For a design with four variables \n\nand three levels, a complete factorial would require 81 runs, while for the same \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\nsituation, the Box-Behnken Design requires only 27 [54]. Replicates in the central \n\npoint are necessary to estimate pure errors. \n\nFour parameters were chosen to be studied. Those factors were chosen based on \n\npreviously done investigations in our group [53] and also based on several papers \n\nfound on the literature. \n\nThe parameters chosen were reaction time (A), reaction temperature (B), molar ratio \n\nbetween methanol and oleic acid (C) and the catalyst dosage (D) and the factors and \n\ntheir respective levels are summarized on Table 13. Two responses were evaluated: \n\nthe conversion of oleic acid, based on acidity decrease, and the FAME content, \n\nthrough gas chromatography analysis.  \n\nTable 13 - Summary of factors and levels for the BBD. \n\nFactor Code \nLevels \n\n-1 0 +1 \n\nReaction time (h) A 4 6 8 \n\nReaction temperature (\u00b0C) B 80 95 110 \n\nMolar ratio MeOH/OA (mol/mol) C 5:1 10:1 15:1 \n\nCatalyst dosage (%wt) D 5 10 15 \n\nTable 14 describes the conditions applied in each run, both by the experimental \n\ndesign and the real values, and the obtained responses.  As mentioned earlier, the \n\nBox-Behnken Design for four factors and three levels requires 27 runs.  \n\nThe evaluation of the responses was done separately. This means that a different \n\nmodel was developed for each of the responses and different optimal conditions \n\nwere estimated. The FAME content was determined by gas chromatography analysis \n\naccording to the procedure appointed on section 4.5.1. The conversion was \n\ndetermined by acidity decrease, as mentioned on section 4.4. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\nTable 14 - Experimental design, real conditions and experimental responses. \n\nRun \n\nExperimental Design Real Conditions \nExperimental \nResponses \n\nTime \n(h) \n\nTemp. \n(\u00b0C) \n\nMolar \nratio \n\nMeOH/\nAO \n\nCat \ndosage\n(wt%) \n\nTime \n(h) \n\nTemp. \n(\u00b0C) \n\nMeOH \n/Oleic \n\nacid ratio \n\nCatalyst \ndosage \n(wt%) \n\nFAME \ncontent \n\n(%) \n\nConversion \nof oleic \nacid (%)  \n\nA B C D A B C D \n\n1\n \n\n-1 1 0 0 4 110 10 10 82.8 83.8 \n\n2 -1 0 0 -1 4 95 10 5 74.2 78.5 \n\n3 0 0 0 0 6 95 10 10 85.0 88.6 \n\n4 -1 0 -1 0 4 95 5 10 65.9 73.4 \n\n5 0 -1 1 0 6 80 15 10 85.5 89.6 \n\n6 0 1 0 1 6 110 10 15 86.8 90.5 \n\n7 0 1 1 0 6 110 15 10 87.5 92.2 \n\n8 0 1 0 -1 6 110 10 5 78.0 79.5 \n\n9 0 -1 -1 0 6 80 5 10 72.6 77.2 \n\n10 1 1 0 0 8 110 10 10 88.0 90.4 \n\n11 1 0 -1 0 8 95 5 10 74.4 77.3 \n\n12 -1 0 1 0 4 95 15 10 84.6 84.6 \n\n13 0 -1 0 -1 6 80 10 5 77.7 82.8 \n\n14 0 0 1 1 6 95 15 15 87.4 92.5 \n\n15 0 0 1 -1 6 95 15 5 78.7 82.4 \n\n16 1 0 0 -1 8 95 10 5 80.4 84.3 \n\n17 1 -1 0 0 8 80 10 10 86.0 90.9 \n\n18 0 1 -1 0 6 110 5 10 68.4 74.5 \n\n19 0 0 0 0 6 95 10 10 84.6 89.2 \n\n20 -1 -1 0 0 4 80 10 10 81.4 83.5 \n\n21 0 0 0 0 6 95 10 10 85.5 88.3 \n\n22 -1 0 0 1 4 95 10 15 81.7 83.4 \n\n23 1 0 0 1 8 95 10 15 87.0 90.5 \n\n24 1 0 1 0 8 95 15 10 90.2 92.8 \n\n25 0 -1 0 1 6 80 10 15 84.5 89.3 \n\n26 0 0 -1 1 6 95 5 15 73.3 74.8 \n\n27\n \n\n0 0 -1 -1 6 95 5 5 64.4 71.9 \n\n5.2.1 Analysis for the conversion of oleic acid  \n\n5.2.1.1 ANOVA table \n\nThe experimental design was evaluated using several statistical tools. The first one \n\nwas the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) table, found on Table 15. The main idea of \n\nthe ANOVA is to compare the variation in the response due to treatment, which \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\nmeans the change in the level of the variables, with the variation due to random \n\nerrors that are inherent to the measurement of the response. With this approach, it is \n\npossible to determine whether the regression proposed is adequate while taking into \n\nconsideration the experimental inaccuracies associated to the process [54].  \n\nThe ANOVA table is constructed by calculating the squares of the deviations of each \n\nobservation from the mean. The sum of squares for all deviations gives origin to the \n\ntotal sum of squares (SSTOTAL), which can be dismantled in two parts: the sum of \n\nsquares due to the regression (SSmodel) and the sum of squares due to residuals \n\n(SSresiduals) generated by the model. Since replicates of the center points are made, it \n\nis possible to estimate pure errors associated to the measurement of the response \n\nand therefore to break the sum of squares of the residuals into the sum of squares \n\ndue to pure error (SSpe) and the sum of squares due to the lack of fit (SSlof) [54]. The \n\ntotal sum of squares is given by equation (5). Then, each of the sums of squares \n\nshould be divided by its respective degree of freedom, giving rise to the media of the \n\nsquare (MS).  \n\n??????? = ??????? + ???? + ?????  (5) \n\nThe significance of the regression is evaluated by the ratio of the MS of the \n\nregression (MSmodel) by the MS of the residuals (MSresidual), leading to the calculated \n\nF-value. This value must be compared to the F-value tabulated (F test) by taking into \n\naccount the degrees of freedom from both the regression and the residual. If the \n\ncalculated value is higher than the tabulated one, means that the regression is \n\nstatistically significant and therefore, the model is well fitted to the data, with a 95% \n\nconfidence level. In the current analysis, the calculated F-value for the regression is \n\n112.74. Considering the degrees of freedom of the regression (df1 = 14) and the \n\ndegrees of freedom of the residual (df2 = 12), and checking the Fisher\u2019s distribution \n\ntable for the critical value of F14,12,0.05 (? equal to 0.05), it is possible to find a \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\ntabulated value of 2.637. The calculated value is higher than the tabulated, indicating \n\na reliable model. \n\nTable 15 - ANOVA table for conversion. \n\nSource \nSum of \nsquares \n\n(SS) \nDf* \n\nMean \nSquare \n(MS) \n\nCalculated \nF-value \n\nTabulated \nF-value \n\np-value \n\nModel 1085.81 14 77.56 112.74 2.637 1.64x10\n-10 \n\nResidual 8.26 12 0.688    \n\nLack of Fit 7.86 10 0.7863 4.01 19.396 0.2162 \n\nPure Error 0.3925 2 0.1962    \n\nCor Total 1094.07 26     \n\n *Df = Degrees of freedom \n\nAnother way to evaluate the model is by checking the lack of fit. As in the regression \n\nfit, the lack of fit should be evaluated by comparing the F-value calculated to the \n\ntabulated one. In this case, the degrees of freedom of the lack of fit and the pure \n\nerror must be taken into account. The F distribution appoints that for a F10,2,0.05, the \n\nvalue is 19.396, while the calculated F-value is 4.01, meaning that the lack of fit is not \n\nsignificant. This is the expected response for the lack of fit. It means that the model \n\nerrors are due to random and inherent errors of the system rather than a problem \n\nwith the data fit. Random errors are not related to model quality, while lack of fit is.   \n\nThe p-value is related to the F-value and is defined as the probability that the data \n\nwould be at least as extreme as those observed [55]. In other words, it is related to \n\nthe strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. Low p-values allow rejecting the \n\nnull hypothesis, which in this case would be that the model is not relevant or that the \n\nfactors don\u2019t influence the response. If the null hypothesis is rejected, then the \n\nalternative hypothesis must be true, which would mean that the model and the factors \n\nare relevant. Treatments that result in p-values lower than a pre-determined \n\nsignificance level, which in this case is 0.05, are considered statistically significant. \n\nTherefore, the current model is statistically relevant, and the lack of fit is not. \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\n5.2.1.2 Another tools to assess the model fit \n\nThe quality of the fit was also assessed by other statistical tools. The regression \n\ncoefficient was estimated as R\n2\n=0.9925, indicating that the observed and predicted \n\nvalues are close and that the model can be used to predict responses. To assess the \n\nviability and accuracy of the model, some facts must be checked. First, the residuals \n\nof the runs should be normally distributed. Second, the mean of the residuals should \n\nbe close to 0 and third, the residuals should be unrelated to the levels of any known \n\nvariables [56]. Residuals are estimates of the errors done by subtracting the \n\nobserved response, or the experimental response, from the predicted response. The \n\nnormality of the residuals can be assessed by verifying the normal plot of residuals, \n\ndisplayed on Figure 13. The expectations is that the data is normally distributed when \n\nall the runs fall within a straight diagonal line, without any residuals occurring too far \n\nfrom the line neither any tendency to form a specific pattern, such as a curve in form \n\nof an \u201cs\u201d. Figure 13 shows a set of data that is normally distributed.  \n\n \n\nFigure 13 - Normal plot of residuals. \n\nDesign-Expert\u00ae Software\n\nConversion\n\nColor points by value of\n\nConversion:\n\n71.88 92.83\n\nExternally Studentized Residuals\n\nN\no\n\nrm\na\n\nl \n%\n\n P\nro\n\nb\na\n\nb\nil\nit\ny\n\nNormal Plot of Residuals\n\n-3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3\n\n1\n\n5\n\n20\n\n50\n\n70\n\n90\n\n99\n\n\n\n41 \n \n\nThe residuals versus predicted plotted on Figure 14 helps to verify if the residuals are \n\nclose to 0 and if the residuals are unrelated to the level of the variables. Both \n\nconditions are satisfied, as the residuals fall close to the black line indicating a 0 \n\nmean, and that no specific pattern, such a funnel like appearance, is formed as the \n\npredict response increases. \n\n \n\nFigure 14 - Residuals versus predicted values. \n\nAlso, the residual versus predicted plot helps to identify outliers, which are runs with \n\nvery large residuals that must be discarded from the statistical evaluation. Any value \n\noutside the red line on Figure 14 should be considered an outlier and the experiment \n\nor measurements of the responses should be repeated. It is important to note that \n\nthose are only tools to help to identify problems with the model, so it is important to \n\ncheck for values that are really far apart from the objective and not that every value \n\nfalls in the black line that indicates a deviation of 0.  \n\nDesign-Expert\u00ae Software\n\nConversion\n\nColor points by value of\n\nConversion:\n\n71.88 92.83\n\nPredicted\n\nE\nx\nte\n\nrn\na\n\nll\ny\n S\n\ntu\nd\n\ne\nn\n\nti\nz\ne\n\nd\n R\n\ne\ns\nid\n\nu\na\n\nls\nResiduals vs. Predicted\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n70 75 80 85 90 95\n\n4.06986\n\n-4.06986\n\n0\n\n\n\n42 \n \n\n5.2.1.3 Factors effect on the conversion \n\nThere are several ways to evaluate the influence of the factors on the response. One \n\nway is by applying the same logic when the model regression was evaluated, taking \n\ninto consideration the degrees of freedom of each factor and the degree of freedom \n\nof the residual. The ANOVA table can also be built to analyze the influence of each \n\nfactor, as well as the interactions between them and their quadratic effect on the \n\nresponse. As it can be seen on Table 16, the calculated F-value is higher than the \n\ntabulated one for the following parameters: A (time); C (molar ratio); D (catalyst \n\ndosage); C\n2\n; D\n\n2\n; CD; A\n\n2\n; BC, BD and AC. The remaining terms are not significant, \n\nincluding, in this list, the reaction temperature. Besides helping understanding \n\nwhether the factor is statistically significant, the ANOVA helps to interpret how \n\nsignificant each one is. This can be assessed by the p-value. The lowest it is, the \n\nhighest the influence on the response. In this way, the order of importance is C \n\n(molar ratio MeOH/OA) > D (catalyst dosage) > A (time) ? C\n2\n > D\n\n2\n > CD > A\n\n2 \n> BC > \n\nBD > AC. \n\nTable 16 - ANOVA analysis for the parameters influencing the Conversion. \n\nSource \nSum of \nsquares \n\n(SS) \nDf* \n\nMean \nSquare \n(MS) \n\nCalculated \nF-value \n\nTabulated \nF-value \n\np-value \n\nA-Time 126.82 1 126.82 184.34 4.965 1.216x10\n-08\n\n \n\nB-Temperature 0.5208 1 0.5208 0.7571 4.965 0.4013 \n\nC-Molar ratio MeOH/OA 601.80 1 601.80 874.77 4.965 1.4x10\n-12\n\n \n\nD-Catalyst dosage 144.84 1 144.84 210.53 4.965 5.68x10\n-09\n\n \n\nAB 0.1600 1 0.1600 0.2326 4.965 0.6383 \n\nAC 4.95 1 4.95 7.20 4.965 0.0199 \n\nAD 0.4900 1 0.4900 0.7123 4.965 0.4152 \n\nBC 7.00 1 7.00 10.17 4.965 0.0078 \n\nBD 5.13 1 5.13 7.46 4.965 0.0182 \n\nCD 13.10 1 13.10 19.05 4.965 0.0009 \n\nA\u00b2 11.12 1 11.12 16.17 4.965 0.0017 \n\nB\u00b2 0.0486 1 0.0486 0.0706 4.965 0.7950 \n\nC\u00b2 144.65 1 144.65 210.27 4.965 5.71x10\n-09\n\n \n\nD\u00b2 50.81 1 50.81 73.86 4.965 1.8x10\n-06\n\n \n\n*Df = Degrees of freedom \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\nFigures 15 through 20 display the response surface for several pairs of variables and \n\nthe interaction plots of those same variables and their influence on the conversion, in \n\ncoded values. Any variable that is not on display on each plot was set to its \n\nintermediate value (0). \n\nFigure 15 displays the response surface regarding the influence of variables time and \n\ntemperature and the interaction plot of those two variables. The response surface \n\nindicates that the temperature variable is negligible for the conversion. By \n\nestablishing a fixed value for the time, for instance -1, and moving along the \n\ntemperature axis, no change in the response is noticed, therefore, its influence is \n\nirrelevant. On the other hand, by doing the same analysis for the time variable, it is \n\npossible to verify that the response alters as we move to upper values for the variable \n\ntime.  \n\n \n\nFigure 15 - Response surface for the conversion being influenced by time (A) and temperature (B) \nand the interaction plot of those variables (Molar ratio = 0; Catalyst dosage = 0). \n\nThe interaction plot on Figure 15 permits to evaluate if the variables influence one \n\nanother. If the interaction plot displays two parallel lines, the conclusion is that the \n\neffect of one factor does not depends on the level of the other factor. If the lines are \n\n\n\n44 \n \n\nnot parallel, it means that the effect displayed by one factor depends on the level of \n\nthe other factor. In other words, it means that one factor not only influences the \n\nresponse by itself, but it also influences the other variable, changing the effect of this \n\nsecond variable on the response.  As displayed on Figure 15, it is clear that the \n\nvariables do not affect each other. \n\nFigure 16 displays the response surface for the variables time and molar ratio and \n\ntheir interaction plot. Both variables influence positively the response. By combining \n\nthem in their bottom value (-1), the conversion is estimated as 72%, while for their \n\nupper bound (+1) the conversion is estimated as above 90%. Also, it is clear that the \n\nmolar ratio has a stronger influence on the response. The interaction plot displays \n\ntwo slight non-parallel lines, meaning that these variables influence each other. This \n\nis in agreement with the p-value of 0.0199 found for the interaction of those factors. \n\n \n\nFigure 16 - Response surface for the conversion being influenced by time (A) and molar ratio between \nmethanol and oleic acid (C) and the interaction plot of those variables (Temperature = 0; Catalyst \ndosage = 0). \n\nFigure 17 displays the response surface for the variables time and catalyst dosage \n\nand their respective interaction plot. The behavior of both variables is very similar, \n\nand significant to the response. This restates the p-values found for the individual \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\nfactors of 1.216?10\n-8\n\n for time and 5.68?10\n-9\n\n for the catalyst dosage. The values mean \n\nthat the factors are statistically relevant for the response and they are somewhat \n\nclose, therefore justifying the similar behavior displayed. The interaction plot displays \n\ntwo parallel lines, indicating that there is no influence of one factor on the other, in \n\nagreement with the p-value of 0.4152. \n\n \n \n\nFigure 17 - Response surface for the conversion being influenced by time (A) and catalyst dosage (D) \nand the interaction plot of those variables (Temperature = 0; molar ratio = 0). \n\nFigure 18 shows the surface response for the variables temperature and molar ratio \n\nbetween methanol and oleic acid and their interaction plot. The surface clearly \n\nindicates that the variable temperature is not relevant, while the molar ratio is. The \n\ninteraction plot shows two non-parallel lines, indicating that the variables have \n\ninfluence on one another. For this case, the interaction can be easily justified. Even \n\nthough the reaction is carried under methanol reflux, the rise in temperature leads to \n\nan elevation on the rate of methanol that is evaporating. Therefore, it also influences \n\nthe amount of methanol that is present at every moment during the reaction. This \n\ninfluence is mainly felt when the molar ratio is in its lower value (-1), as displayed on \n\nthe interaction plot on Figure 18. \n\n\n\n46 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 18 - Response surface for the conversion being influenced by temperature (B) and molar ratio \nbetween methanol and oleic acid (C) and the interaction plot of those variables (time = 0; catalyst \ndosage = 0). \n\nFigure 19 shows the response surface for the temperature and catalyst dosage \n\nvariables.   \n\nFigure 19 - Response surface for the conversion being influenced by temperature (B) and catalyst \ndosage (D) and the interaction plot of those variables (time = 0; molar ratio = 0). \n\n\n\n47 \n \n\nAgain, in Figure 19, the temperature does not show any great alteration on the \n\nresponse, while the catalyst dosage does. The interaction plot shows two non-parallel \n\nlines, indicating that there is influence of the parameters on each other.  \n\nFigure 20 displays the response surface for the catalyst dosage and molar ratio \n\nvariables and their interaction plot. Both the variables have a great influence on the \n\nresponse, although it is possible to identify that the molar ratio variable is much more \n\nrelevant. The interaction plot indicates that the variables have influence on each \n\nother, as the lines displayed are not parallel. The interaction of those two variables is \n\nthe most relevant interaction, with a p-value of 0.009. \n\n \n\nFigure 20 - Response surface for the conversion being influenced by molar ratio between methanol \nand oleic acid (C) and catalyst dosage (D) and the interaction plot of those variables (time =0; \ntemperature = 0). \n\n5.2.1.4 Optimal conditions estimation \n\nOne of the advantages of applying a Response Surface Methodology, such as the \n\nBox-Behnken Design, is that it allows the construction of a quadratic equation in the \n\nform of equation (4) presented in section 4.6, and as a consequence, allows us to \n\ndetermine the optimum combination of a set of parameters [57] .   \n\n\n\n48 \n \n\n? =  ?0 + ? ?? ??\n\n4\n\n?=1\n\n+ ? ??? ??\n2\n\n4\n\n?=1\n\n+ ? ??? ?? ??\n?<?\n\n (4) \n\nWhere Y is the response, ?0 is the intercept coefficient, ?? are the linear terms, ??? the \n\nquadratic terms, ???the interaction terms and ?? and ?? are the independent factors. \n\nTable 17 displays the coefficients determined by regression of the data set. Using the \n\ninformation of the coefficients, it is possible to construct the equation that best fits the \n\nregion studied, as displayed by equation (6). The equation is constructed using \n\ncoded values. \n\nTable 17 - Coefficients for the quadratic equation. \n\nCoded Factor Coefficient \n\nIntercept 88.68 \n\nA 3.25 \n\nB -0.2083 \n\nC 7.08 \n\nD 3.47 \n\nA\n2 \n\n-1.44 \n\nB\n2 \n\n-0.0954 \n\nC\n2 \n\n-5.21 \n\nD\n2 \n\n-3.09 \n\nAB -0.2000 \n\nAC 1.11 \n\nAD 0.3500 \n\nBC 1.32 \n\nBD 1.13 \n\nCD 1.81 \n\n \n\n? =  88.68 + 3.25 ? ? 0.21 ? + 7.08 ? + 3.47 ? ? 1.44 ?2 ? 0.1 ?2 ? 5.21 ? 2 ? 3.1 ?2 ?\n0.20 ?? + 1.11 ?? + 0.35 ?? + 1.32 ?? + 1.13 ?? + 1.81 ??       (6) \n\nBy maximizing equation (6), it is possible to determine which values for the set of \n\nparameters studied would lead to the highest conversion of oleic acid, which is \n\ndisplayed on Table 18, both in coded values and in real values. It is important to \n\nunderstand that the optimal values found are strongly related to the region studied. If \n\nthe real values for the molar ratio were changed, for instance, possibly the optimum \n\ncombination of the parameters would be different.  \n\n\n\n49 \n \n\nTable 18 - Optimal values for the conversion of oleic acid. \n\nFactor Factor Name Coded Value Real Value \n\nA Time 1.00 8h \n\nB Temperature 1.00 110\u00b0C \n\nC Molar Ratio MeOH/OA 1.00 15:1 \n\nD Catalyst Dosage 0.99 15% \n\nEven though the evaluation of the influence of the parameters indicated that the \n\ntemperature does not significantly influences the response, the values obtained for \n\nthe optimal conditions do not reflect only the individual influence of each factor, but \n\nalso the interaction that they have amongst each other. That is the reason why even \n\nnot being statistically significant, the optimal conditions are obtained with the \n\ntemperature at its highest value (+1).  \n\nAfter estimating the optimal conditions, new runs were carried out with the purpose of \n\nconfirming the predicted results and consequently, the model. Three experiments \n\nwere run and the results obtained are displayed in Figure 21.  \n\n \n\nFigure 21 - Predicted results and confirmation runs for the conversion of oleic acid. \n\n\n\n50 \n \n\nThe average of the conversion is 95.25, which is within the range predicted by the \n\nmodel, with a 95% confidence level (range for conversion: 95.21 -100.73%).  This \n\nconfirms that the model is suitable for predicting the behavior of the system. \n\n5.2.2 Analysis for the FAME content  \n\n5.2.2.1 ANOVA table \n\nThe ANOVA table was built in the same way as it was built for the conversion. The \n\nANOVA for the FAME content evaluation displayed on Table 19 indicates that the \n\nmodel is significant, with a calculated F-value higher than the tabulated one. Also, the \n\nlack of fit is not significant (calculated F-value lower than the tabulated one).  \n\nTable 19 - ANOVA table for the FAME content. \n\nSource \nSum of \nsquares \n\nDf \nMean \n\nSquare \nCalculated \n\nF-value \nTabulated \nF-value \n\np-value \n\nModel 1319.90 14 94.28 72.92 2.637 2.14x10\n-09\n\n \n\nResidual 15.52 12 1.29    \nLack of Fit 15.12 10 1.51 7.63 19.396 0.1213 \nPure Error 0.3961 2 0.1980    \n\nTotal 1335.41 26     \n\n5.2.2.2 Another tools to assess the model fit \n\nThe regression coefficient was estimated as R\n2\n= 0.9884, indicating a good \n\nregression.

The leas relevant variable is the temperature, and \n\nby checking Figure 24, Figure 27 and Figure 28 it is easy to arrive at this conclusion. \n\nChanging the level of the temperature does not cause any visible alteration on the \n\nFAME content. \n\n\n\n53 \n \n\n \n \nFigure 24 - Response surface regarding the influence of time (A) and temperature (B) on the FAME \n\ncontent and the interaction plot of those variables (C = 0; D = 0). \n\n  \n\nFigure 25 - Response surface regarding the influence of time (A) and molar ratio between methanol \nand oleic acid (C) on the FAME content and the interaction plot of those variables (B = 0; D = 0). \n\n \n\n\n\n54 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 26 - Response surface regarding the influence of time (A) and catalyst dosage (D) on the \nFAME content and the interaction plot of those variables (B = 0; C = 0). \n\n \n\nAlso, the only relevant interaction between factors, according to the ANOVA, is \n\nbetween variables temperature and molar ratio, displayed on Figure 27. \n\n \n\nFigure 27 - Response surface regarding the influence of temperature (B) and molar ratio between \nmethanol and oleic acid (C) on the FAME content and the interaction plot of those variables (A = 0; D \n=0). \n\n \n\n\n\n55 \n \n\nThe interaction plot displays non-parallel lines, confirming the information given by \n\nthe ANOVA.

The first is the investigation performed by Xu et al. (2015) [33] regarding \n\nthe transesterification reaction of castor oil and methanol. The response evaluated \n\nwas for the FAME content and the optimal conditions were determined as molar ratio \n\nof 6:1, 4h reaction time, 77\u00b0C and a catalyst dosage 12wt%. The temperature was \n\nthe most relevant factor, while the time was the least important and it was not \n\n\n\n58 \n \n\ninvestigated by the response surface methodology. The FAME content under these \n\nconditions was 89.82%. They have arrived at a very different conclusion regarding \n\nthe influence of the temperature on the FAME content. This can be related to the \n\nregion chosen for the investigation: they studied the influence of the temperature on \n\nthe range 65 \u2013 85\u00b0C. Our study was performed on the range 80 \u2013 110\u00b0C. The same \n\ncan be appointed for the molar ratio: Xu et al. investigated the molar ratio varying \n\nfrom 5:1 \u2013 7:1, and we have studied from 5:1 \u2013 15:1. This difference in the regions \n\nchosen leads to a different combination of optimal conditions, and therefore explains \n\nthe contrasting conclusion. \n\nThe second study was an esterification reaction of oleic acid performed by Sun et al. \n\n(2015) [37]. The response evaluated was the conversion, and under the optimal \n\nconditions (molar ratio 4:1, reaction time 6h and catalyst dosage 3.5 mL) the \n\nconversion was 92.5%. The temperature was not mentioned and there is no \n\ninformation regarding on the influence of each factor. There is also no information \n\nregarding the regions studied. The results obtained are moreover similar to ours, \n\nalthough the optimal conditions are distinct. \n\nThe two most relevant parameters in both responses were the molar ratio and the \n\ncatalyst dosage. Some authors reached a comparable conclusion. Ding et al.(2018) \n\n[38] also concluded that those variables were the most influential for the \n\ntransesterification reaction of palm oil using [HSO3-BMIM][HSO4], although the order \n\nof influence was inverse.  Zhang et al. (2017) [58] also concluded that the molar ratio \n\nis the most important variable in the esterification reaction of oleic acid using \n\n[BSMIM]CF3SO3. \n\nOn the other hand, temperature was the least relevant factor. A similar conclusion \n\nwas drawn by Jansri et al. (2011) [45] when studying biodiesel production from a high \n\nacidic oil using an esterification reaction catalyzed by sulfuric acid as a treatment \n\nstep followed by a transesterification reaction with sodium hydroxide. They studied \n\nthe kinetics of both the esterification and the transesterification reaction, and after \n\n\n\n59 \n \n\ntesting three different temperatures (55 - 65\u00b0C) they concluded that there was no \n\nincrease in the reaction rate due to temperature and they established that a 60\u00b0C \n\nwas sufficient for biodiesel production in the two-stage process.   \n\n5.3 Kinetic study  \n\nThe esterification reaction of the oleic acid with methanol is an equilibrium reaction \n\nthat can be described by equation (8). The reaction rate can be described by \n\nequation (9), where OA stands for oleic acid, a stands for the order related to the \n\noleic acid, MeOH stands for methanol, b for the order related to methanol, OAME \n\nstands for the oleic acid methyl ester (biodiesel), c for the order related to the oleic \n\nacid methyl ester (biodiesel) and d to the order related to water. k1 is the reaction rate \n\nconstant for the direct reaction while k-1 is the reaction rate constant for the inverse \n\nreaction. \n\n?18?34?2 + ??3?? ? ?19?36?2 +  ?2? (8) \n\n???? =  ?1???\n? \n\n ?????\n?\n\n? ??1?????\n?\n ??2?\n\n?\n  (9) \n\n \n\nThe reaction rate can be simplified by assuming that the methanol is used in excess \n\nin the reaction, therefore supposing that the term ?????\n?\n\n is approximately constant \n\nduring the reaction. Also, since the methanol is in excess, the reaction is shifted \n\ntowards product formation, and therefore the rate of the direct reaction is much \n\ngreater than the rate of the inverse reaction in the beginning of the reaction (when \n\napproaching the equilibrium, the rate of inverse reaction tends to the rate of the direct \n\nreaction). This turns equation (9) into equation (10), where only the concentration of \n\noleic acid is relevant to the rate of reaction. \n\n\n\n60 \n \n\n???? =  \n????\n\n??\n= ??1???\n\n?\n  (10) \n\nTo determine the order of the reaction in relation to the oleic acid a set of \n\nexperiments were carried out under the optimum conditions determined by the \n\nexperimental design: 15 wt% catalyst dosage, 15:1 methanol/oleic acid molar ratio \n\nand 8-hour reaction time. Those conditions remained fixed throughout all \n\nexperiments. The temperature, in its turn, was varied in each experiment: 110, 100, \n\n90, 80 and 70\u00b0C. A sample of 1 mL was retrieved from the reaction throughout the \n\nreaction, at pre-determined times (0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 420 \n\nand 480 min). The acid value of each sample was determined following the EN \n\n14104 [49] and the conversion was estimated by comparing the initial and final acid \n\nvalue, according to equations (1) and (2). It was considered that the initial acid value \n\nis the acid value of the point at 0 min.  \n\nFigure 31 displays the data obtained from each reaction for the acid value and Figure \n\n32 displays the conversion of oleic acid versus time. \n\n \nFigure 31 - Acid value versus reaction time for different temperatures. \n\n\n\n61 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 32 - Conversion versus reaction time for different temperatures. \n\nFrom this data, it was possible to determine the apparent order of the reaction in \n\nrelation to the oleic acid. For this purpose, the integral method was applied for the 0\nth\n, \n\n1\nst\n, 2\n\nnd\n and 3\n\nrd\n order, for all temperatures. Equation (10) was integrated with a \n\nvarying from 0 to 3, giving origin to equations (11) to (14). \n\n0\nth \n\norder ??? = ???;0 ?  ??1? (11) \n\n1\nst \n\norder ln ??? = ln ???;0 ? ??1?

(14) \n\nThe data was then plotted for each reaction order, and it was expected that the data \n\nwould be distributed in a straight line. Then, to determine the order of the reaction, \n\nthe coefficient of determination (R\n2\n) of each experiment was compared. The order \n\n\n\n62 \n \n\nthat resulted in a highest coefficient was understood as the apparent order of the \n\nreaction. The coefficients of determination for each temperature and each trial are \n\ndisplayed on Table 24. The highest coefficient was obtained for the 3\nrd\n\n order for all \n\ntemperatures.  \n\nTable 24 - Coefficient of determination obtained applying the integral method for several reaction \norders. \n\nR\n2 \n\nTemperature (\u00b0C) 0\nth\n order 1\n\nst\n order 2\n\nnd\n order 3\n\nrd\n order \n\n110 0.79104 0.89321 0.96452 0.99502 \n\n100 0.76587 0.87159 0.94736 0.98604 \n\n90 0.77845 0.88433 0.95906 0.99457 \n\n80 0.75418 0.85525 0.93169 0.97686 \n\n70 0.81139 0.89896 0.95992 0.99089 \n\nThe integrated form of the reaction rate for a 3\nrd \n\norder reaction is represented by \n\nequation (14). It is possible to retrieve a value of k\u20191 for each temperature, which is \n\nappointed on Table 25.  \n\nTable 25 - Kinetic constants for each temperature. \n\nTemperature (\u00b0C) k\u20191 (L\n2\n.mol\n\n-2\n.min\n\n-1\n) \n\n110 0.00914 \n\n100 0.00829 \n\n90 0.00805 \n\n80 0.00760 \n\n70 0.00700 \n\nThe kinetics constant k\u20191 is related to the temperature by the Arrhenius equation and \n\nit is given in the form of equation (15). \n\n??1 = ?0???\n???\n??  (15) \n\nWhere k\u20191 is the kinetics constant at a determined temperature, k0 is the pre-\n\nexponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, in kJ/mol, R is the gas constant, in \n\nkJ/mol.K, and T is the temperature, in K. The Arrhenius equation establishes that at a \n\ngiven temperature T, the fraction of collisions between molecules with the minimum \n\n\n\n63 \n \n\nrequired energy Ea is proportional to e\n-Ea/RT\n\n and therefore, the rate constant is also \n\nproportional to that same factor [39]. The Arrhenius equation can be linearized by \n\napplying the natural logarithm in both sides of equation (15), leading to equation (16). \n\nln ??1 = ln ?0 ?  \n??\n\n??\n (16) \n\nTherefore, by plotting the inverse of the temperature, in K, and the natural logarithm \n\nof the kinetics constant at each temperature, it is possible to estimate the activation \n\nenergy for the reaction. The Arrhenius plot is displayed on Figure 33. A coefficient of \n\ndetermination of R\n2\n=0.9181 was obtained. The pre-exponential factor (?0) was \n\nestimated as 0.0765 L\n2\n.mol\n\n-2\n.min\n\n-1\n and the activation energy (??) as 6.8 kJ/mol. The \n\nlow activation energy indicates a certain independency to the temperature. As \n\nmentioned earlier, reactions with small activation energies have rates that only \n\nincrease slightly with the temperature. This result agrees with the conclusion \n\nachieved through the RSM for the conversion that the temperature is not statistically \n\nrelevant. \n\n \nFigure 33 - Arrhenius plot for the experimental data. \n\n\n\n64 \n \n\nAranda et al. (2008) [44] arrived at similar results for the activation energy. They \n\nstudied the esterification reaction applying sulfuric acid and methanesulfonic acid and \n\narrived at the activation energies of 6.53 kJ/mol and 3.78 kJ/mol, respectively. Even \n\nthough the values are very similar to the ones observed in our study, the ionic liquid \n\npresents the advantage of being environmentally friendly and also safer in terms of \n\nhandling. Other authors reported activation energies for the esterification using \n\nsulfuric acid that are higher than the one observed in this paper [42,43,45]. \n\nActivation energies for the esterification reaction using various ionic liquids as \n\ncatalysts were also reported. Fauzi et al. (2014) [41] reported a value of 17.97 kJ/mol \n\nfor the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrachloroferrite. Ullah et al. (2017) \n\n[46] obtained a value of 19.24 kJ/mol for the ionic liquid 3-methyl-1-(4-sulfobutyl)-\n\nbenzimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate. Both reported values are higher than the \n\none observed in this study, reinforcing the suitability of the ionic liquid 1-\n\nmethylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate as catalyst for the esterification reaction of FFAs. \n\n5.4 Transesterification study \n\nA set of experiments was done in order to evaluate the ionic liquid as a suitable \n\ncatalyst for promoting the transesterification reaction of triglycerides as well. As the \n\npurpose of the current work is to replace conventional catalysts by alternatives that \n\ncould be applied to low quality feedstock, the available oil sample was replaced by a \n\nmixture of oil and oleic acid, which was varied in different mass proportions. The \n\nFAME content was evaluated for each sample. The reaction was carried out under \n\nthe optimum conditions determined for the conversion of oleic acid: 8h, 110\u00b0C and \n\n15wt% catalyst dosage. The mole ratio of methanol was increased to 20:1 and it was \n\ncalculated assuming that the total mass for each run was of triolein. \n\nTable 26 presents the conditions for each run and the FAME content obtained and \n\nFigure 34 shows the observed relationship between the amount, in relation to the \n\ntotal mass, of oleic acid added to the mixture and the obtained FAME content. The \n\n\n\n65 \n \n\nresults indicate that probably only the FFAs present in the oleic acid were \n\nsynthesized to esters, which means that the catalyst was only able to promote the \n\nesterification reaction. Moreover, more investigation should be done in order to \n\nevaluate if this apparent conclusion really applies. Anyhow, the ionic liquid seems \n\nsuitable to be used as treatment step for acidic oils.  \n\nTable 26 - Conditions and FAME content for transesterification reactions. \n\nRun \n\nIonic \nliquid \nmass \n\n(g) \n\nOil \nmass \n\n(g) \n\nOleic \nAcid \n\nmass (g) \n\nOleic \nacid \n\n(wt%) \n\nTotal \nmass \n\n(g) \n\nMethanol \nvolume \n\n(mL) \n\nTemp. \n(\u00b0C) \n\nTime \n(h) \n\nFAME \ncontent \n\n(%) \n\nT1  3.0050 4.0229 16.0911 80% 20.1140 18.5 110 8 71.36 \n\nT2  3.0929 8.0110 12.0716 60% 20.0826 18.5 110 8 53.26 \n\nT3.1  3.0014 10.0048 10.0084 50% 20.0132 18.5 110 8 45.69 \n\nT3.2 3.0103 10.0084 10.2600 51% 20.2684 18.5 110 8 44.71 \n\nT4  3.0557 12.0164 8.0026 40% 20.0190 18.5 110 8 37.93 \n\nT5  3.0138 15.9998 4.0199 20% 20.0197 18.5 110 8 19.89 \n\n \n\nFigure 34 - Relationship between the amount of oleic acid added and FAME content. \n\n\n\n66 \n \n\n5.5 FT-IR analysis \n\nFT-IR was used to characterize several samples, including the starting materials and \n\nthe products. FT-IR helps to understand if the reaction is actually accomplishing the \n\nobjective of converting the FFAs into FAMEs. Figure 35 displays the oleic acid \n\nsample. The broad band from 3300 to 2500 cm\n-1\n\n and centered at 3000 cm\n-1 \n\nis a \n\ncharacteristic absorption attributed to acidic and strongly bounded hydrogen, such as \n\nthose of carboxylic acids. The bands at 2650 and 2550 cm\n-1 \n\nare also in this overtone \n\nregion and are a characteristic pattern for a COOH group. The bands at 2924 and \n\n2855 cm\n-1 \n\nthat overlap with the broad band corresponding to the O-H bond are \n\nassociated with the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of aliphatic C-H bonds, \n\nrespectively. The most strong and sharp that is visible at 1705 cm\n-1\n\n is ascribed to the \n\nC=O stretching of a dimer in the carboxylic acid, such as the oleic acid. The band at \n\n1458 cm\n-1 \n\nis associated with the asymmetrical CH3 deformation and the band at 1410 \n\ncm\n-1 \n\nis related to the CH2 bend. The multiple weak bands at 1288 and 1242 cm\n-1 \n\nare \n\nrelated to wagging vibrations from CH2 in normal hydrocarbon chains. Both 1288 cm\n-1\n\n \n\nand 1242 cm\n-1\n\n bands are related with the stretch and bend in the COOH group. They \n\nresult from combination of O-C-O asymmetric stretch and OH bend. The band at 933 \n\ncm\n-1\n\n is characteristic of the dimeric oleic acid and results from an angular \n\ndeformation outside the plan of O-H bond. The band at 725 cm\n-1\n\n is ascribed to the \n\nconcerted rocking of all CH2 groups in the chain of four or more carbons [59,60].  \n\n \n\n\n\n67 \n \n\n \nFigure 35 - FT-IR spectrum of oleic acid (CH3(CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)7COOH). \n\nThe FT-IR spectrum of the biodiesel sample was very similar to the spectrum of the \n\noleic acid, as displayed on Figure 36. The biodiesel sample analyzed was obtained \n\nthrough esterification under the optimum conditions (8h, 110\u00b0C, 15:1 mole ratio, \n\n15wt% catalyst dosage). The bands at 2924 and 2855 cm\n-1 \n\nare also associated with \n\nthe asymmetric and symmetric stretching of aliphatic C-H bonds, respectively. The \n\nbands at 1458 and 1373 cm\n-1\n\n are related to the CH3 asymmetric and symmetric \n\ndeformation, respectively, in methyl groups close to the carbonyl group. The band at \n\n717 cm\n-1\n\n is associated with the rocking motion of four or more CH2 groups in an open \n\nchain [60].  The differences are related to the disappearance of the broad  band \n\ncentered at 3000 cm\n-1 \n\nand the shifting in the absorption of the C=O bond, now at \n\n1744 cm\n-1\n\n, which is a characteristic absorption of the C=O bond in esters. Also, two \n\nor more bands related to the C-O stretching vibration are present in the spectrum, in \n\nthe region from 1300 \u2013 1000 cm\n-1\n\n. The C-O stretch that is attached to the carbonyl \n\ngroup appears in the region 1300 to 1150 cm\n-1\n\n while the other band, that is usually \n\nweaker than the first, appears in the region 1150 \u2013 1000 cm\n-1 \n\n[60]. Therefore, the \n\n\n\n68 \n \n\nbands at 1172 cm\n-1 \n\nand 1018 cm\n-1\n\n are ascribed to the absorption of the C-O \n\nstretching. Those differences appointed are a confirmation that the FFAs were \n\nsuccessfully converted into FAMEs. \n\n \n\nFigure 36 - FT-IR spectrum of biodiesel (FAMEs) sample (CH3(CH3)nCOOCH3). \n\nThe same analysis was done to verify the structure of the methanol, the ionic liquid \n\nand the waste oil. Figure 37 displays the FT-IR for the methanol. The most \n\ncharacteristics IR absorption bands for alcohols are in the range of 3650 \u2013 3200 cm\n-1\n\n, \n\nrelated to the stretching vibration of the -OH and the region from 1260 \u2013 970 cm\n-1\n\n, \n\nassociated to the stretching vibration of the CO bond [61]. Therefore, the broad band \n\ncentered at 3325 cm\n-1\n\n is ascribed to the OH stretching and the sharp and strong \n\nband at 1026 cm\n-1\n\n to the C-O bond. The bands at 2985, 2947, 2893 and 2831 cm\n-1\n\n \n\nare related to aliphatic CH stretching. The band at 1450 cm\n-1\n\n is related to the \n\nsymmetric CH3 umbrella deformation, which is overlapped by the out of plane C-OH \n\ndeformation at 1396 cm\n-1\n\n. The out-of-plane C-OH deformation gives rises to a \n\nsecond broad band, which is identified as the one at 655 cm\n-1\n\n.  \n\n\n\n69 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 37 - FT-IR spectrum of methanol (CH3OH). \n\nFigure 38 presents the FT-IR obtained for the ionic liquid, which structure is displayed \n\nin Figure 12. Heterocyclic compounds with two double bonds in a five-membered ring \n\nusually show three ring vibrations near 1590, 1490 and 1400 cm\n-1 . \n\nThe CH stretch for \n\nheteroaromatic rings containing nitrogen falls in the region 3180 \u2013 3090 cm\n-1\n\n [59]. \n\nTherefore, the bonds at 1590, 1550 and 1450 cm\n-1 \n\nare related to the ring in the \n\nimidazolium cation while the band at 3140 cm\n-1\n\n can be ascribed to the stretching \n\nvibration of the CH bonds in the cation. Also, most of five-membered rings containing \n\na CH=CH unsubstituted group have strong hydrogen wag absorption in the region \n\n900 \u2013 700 cm\n-1\n\n [59], and therefore the bands at 840 and 756 cm\n-1 \n\ncan be associated \n\nwith this vibration. The band at 2970 cm\n-1\n\n is attributed to the out-of-phase CH3 stretch \n\nand the band at 2877 cm\n-1\n\n to the in-phase CH3 stretch [59]. The group HSO4\n-1\n\n has \n\ntwo absorption bands: one from 1190 \u2013 1160 cm\n-1\n\n related to the asymmetric SO3\n-1\n\n \n\nstretch and at 1080 \u2013 1015 cm\n-1\n\n related to the symmetric SO3\n-1\n\n stretch [59], \n\nconsequently bands 1158 and 1018 cm\n-1\n\n can be ascribed to the anion. \n\n\n\n70 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 38 - FT-IR spectrum of ionic liquid. \n\nFigure 39 displays the FT-IR for the waste cooking oil. The oil is mainly composed by \n\ntriglycerides, which are esters. The characteristics absorptions of ester are a strong \n\nabsorption near 1740 cm \n-1\n\n associated to the C=O stretching and the strong band \n\nnear 1200 cm\n-1\n\n related to the asymmetric stretching of C-O bond [61]. Thus, the \n\nstrong and sharp bond at 1745 cm\n-1\n\n is ascribed to the C=O bond and the band at \n\n1157 cm\n-1 \n\nis attributed to the C-O bond. The bands at 2924 and 2855 cm\n-1\n\n are again \n\nascribed to the stretching of aliphatic C-H bonds. The bands at 1458 and 1373 cm\n-1 \n\nare related to the CH3 asymmetric and symmetric deformation, respectively, in methyl \n\ngroups close to the carbonyl group. The band at 972 cm\n-1 \n\nis attributed to the wag \n\nvibration of the CH2. The band at 718 cm\n-1\n\n is ascribed to the concerted rocking \n\nvibration of four or more CH2 groups in an open chain.  \n\n\n\n71 \n \n\n \nFigure 39 - FT-IR spectrum of the waste oil. \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n72 \n \n\n6. CONCLUSIONS  \n\nIonic liquids as catalysts for biodiesel production seem like a viable alternative to \n\ncommon acidic catalysts. From the 5 tested ionic liquids, 3 displayed good catalytic \n\nactivity and resulted in a conversion higher than 77%. The chosen ionic liquid, 1-\n\nmethylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate resulted in the highest conversion in the \n\nscreening step of this work. The experimental design applied allowed to understand \n\nhow each factor (time, temperature, molar ratio between methanol and oleic acid and \n\ncatalyst dosage) influences both the conversion of the oleic acid and the FAME \n\ncontent of the obtained biodiesel samples when [HMIM][HSO4] was used as catalyst.  \n\nThe most relevant factors were the molar ratio between oleic acid and methanol and \n\nthe catalyst dosage, for both responses (conversion of oleic acid and FAME content). \n\nIt was possible to set the optimum conditions that lead to the highest possible \n\nconversion and highest possible FAME content. The optimal condition for the \n\nconversion was estimated as 8h, 110\u00b0C, 15:1 molar ratio and 15wt% catalyst \n\ndosage, leading to a conversion of 95%. The optimum condition, that lead to a 90% \n\nFAME content, was estimated as 8h, 110\u00b0C, 14:1 molar ratio and 13.5wt% catalyst \n\ndosage. These results indicate that this catalyst has a high potential in biodiesel \n\nproduction: not only it achieved high conversions of the reactant, but it also lead to a \n\nproduct with a high content of fatty acid methyl esters.  \n\nThe preliminary transesterification experiments indicated that the catalyst is not very \n\nsuitable for the transesterification reaction. A very low FAME content was obtained \n\nfor the transesterification experiments and a more comprehensive study is required \n\nfor more adequate conclusions.  \n\nThe kinetic study allowed to estimate the activation energy of the esterification \n\nreaction catalyzed by the ionic liquid 1-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate, \n\nachieving  a very low value of 6.8 kJ/mol. Low activation energy is beneficial, as it \n\nmeans that the reaction requires small energy in order to occur, which leads to a \n\ncheaper process. This low activation energy also helped reinforcing a conclusion \n\n\n\n73 \n \n\ndrawn based on the experimental design: that the temperature is not a very important \n\nparameter for the studied system. The experimental design indicated that the change \n\nin temperature does not affects significantly the reaction and low activation energy is \n\nan indication that with the change in temperature, the rate constant does not vary \n\ngreatly, and therefore the reaction rate does not change greatly as well.  \n\nIn conclusion, the use of ionic liquids as catalyst in biodiesel production presents \n\nseveral advantages. The catalyst chosen for this study led to very good results, \n\nputting it as a suitable replacement for the traditional catalysts.  The experimental \n\ndesign allied to the kinetic study indicated that the catalyst permits a reaction that \n\ndoes not require high temperature, meaning a more economic process.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n74 \n \n\n7. SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE WORK \n\nSome studies are still necessary in order to fully evaluate the suitability of the ionic \n\nliquid 1-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate for biodiesel production. The \n\nsuggestions for future work are: \n\n- A multi-objective optimization of both responses (conversion and FAME \n\ncontent) to determine the optimum condition that would lead simultaneously to the \n\nhighest conversion and FAME content. \n\n- A wider study comprehending the use of the ionic liquid 1-methylimidazolium \n\nhydrogen sulfate as a possible catalyst for simultaneously promoting the esterification \n\nreaction of FFAs and the transesterification reaction of triglycerides for low quality \n\nfeedstock.  \n\n- Test of the ionic liquid as a treatment step for low quality oils, by previous \n\nesterification of FFAs, followed by a transesterification reaction with a classical alkali \n\ncatalyst. \n\n- A more complete study of the kinetics of the esterification reaction, by varying \n\nthe proportions between methanol and oleic acid and the amount of ionic liquid; \n\n- A recovery study for the ionic liquid [HMIM][HSO4], in order to assess the \n\nnumber of reaction cycles in which high conversions and high FAME content could \n\nbe attained.  \n\n- A more extensive study using the other ionic liquids (1-methylimidazolium \n\nhydrogen sulfate and 1-methylimidazolium methyl sulfate) that displayed adequate \n\nresults to determine their applicability in biodiesel production. \n\n- Phase equilibrium study for the mixture methanol-water-biodiesel-oleic acid. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n75 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n[1] Talebian-Kiakalaieh A, Amin NAS.
