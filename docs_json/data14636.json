The giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera (L.) \n\nC.A. Agardh forms dense marine forests serving as a foundation species in ecosystems \n\nthat are of great ecological and economic importance. Thus, the objective of this study \n\nwas to test for evidence of local adaptation to conditions representative of MHWs stress \n\nin the field on a regional level, encompassing areas with different oceanographic regimes \n\nand genetic groups. Adult blades from two depths and four regions of the Northeast \n\nPacific were exposed to simulated nutrient and thermal stress conditions. The results \n\nclearly showed that M. pyrifera populations at the southernmost limit displayed greater \n\nthermal tolerance in their photosynthetic physiology. Compared to the other regions, \n\nsurface blades from the South suffered reduced impact on the photosynthetic apparatus, \n\nwith Fv/Fm values at 24\u00baC 15.5% higher than the regional mean. Thermally-sensitive \n\nparameters governed mainly by enzymatic processes (rETRmax and Ek) were unaffected \n\nover the 15 - 24\u00baC range in the southernmost region, suggesting adaptation to local \n\nenvironmental conditions. Amongst the bottom blades collected at depth, photosynthetic \n\nresponses to stress were rather similar among different regions. The F1 juvenile \n\ngeneration grown in vitro from parental source material did not exhibit a significant \n\nreductions in Fv/Fm under the moderate stress temperature used (21\u00baC), but rETRmax and \n\nEk remained significantly higher in the Southern regions. Consistently poor \n\nphotosynthetic responses to thermal stress were observed in the North-Center region \n\n(Santa Barbara) in all experiments, suggesting genetically-based fitness reduction. Our \n\nresults also highlighted the need for further research on the synergistic effects of low \n\nnutrients availability and high thermal stress considering different life stages of M. \n\npyrifera.  \n\n \n\nKey-words: Giant kelp, foundation species, climate change, thermal stress, local \n\nadaptation \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nResumo \n\n \n\nEvid\u00eancias cient\u00edficas de altera\u00e7\u00f5es no ambiente e distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies devido a \n\nmudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas de caracter global, tem aumentado largamente nas \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas. \n\nEventos como as ondas de calor marinhas, t\u00eam aumentado a sua frequ\u00eancia (em cerca de \n\n38%), dura\u00e7\u00e3o e intensidade, amea\u00e7ando v\u00e1rios ecossistemas marinhos como recifes de \n\ncoral, pradarias marinhas e florestas marinhas, assim com esp\u00e9cies de grande relev\u00e2ncia \n\necon\u00f3mica. Esp\u00e9cies como as lagostas e as am\u00eaijoas foram afetadas atrav\u00e9s da redu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndo habitat e por stress t\u00e9rmico, o que resultou num aumento da mortalidade, na redu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndo tamanho dos indiv\u00edduos e da sua taxa de reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nO Kelp gigante, Macrocystis pyrifera (L.) C.A. Agardh \u00e9 o kelp com maior distribui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nnos oceanos que forma extensas florestas marinhas, com uma can\u00f3pia densa na superf\u00edcie \n\nresultando numa grande produ\u00e7\u00e3o prim\u00e1ria a qual alimenta diretamente organismos \n\nherb\u00edvoros mas maioritariamente detrit\u00edvoros. Devido a sua densidade e dimens\u00e3o, as \n\nflorestas de M. pyrifera s\u00e3o capazes de alterar as condi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientas locais, \n\nnomeadamente reduzindo correntes e luz, criando um habitat heterog\u00e9neo, abrigando um \n\ngrande n\u00famero de esp\u00e9cies. Assim, funciona como uma esp\u00e9cie fundadora do ecossistema \n\napresentando grande relev\u00e2ncia ecol\u00f3gica e econ\u00f3mica.  \n\nA fotoss\u00edntese \u00e9 influenciada pela temperatura que regula as taxas de rea\u00e7\u00f5es e \n\nmovimentos de solutos dentro das c\u00e9lulas das algas tendo sido utilizada com sucesso \n\nnoutros estudos, para quantificar o efeito de aumento de temperatura em kelps. Um dos \n\nm\u00e9todos mais comuns para medir respostas fotossint\u00e9ticas em eco-fisiologia \u00e9 o \n\nfluor\u00f3metro (PAM), pois \u00e9 capaz de determinar eficientemente as taxas fotossint\u00e9ticas \n\nem laborat\u00f3rio e tamb\u00e9m no campo. \n\nA utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de t\u00e9cnicas de dete\u00e7\u00e3o remota como boias e sat\u00e9lites em estudos \n\noceanogr\u00e1ficos, permite obter dados a uma grande escala e com grande regularidade \n\npossibilitando a an\u00e1lise de padr\u00f5es e fatores relevantes como por exemplo oscila\u00e7\u00f5es da \n\ntemperatura da superf\u00edcie do mar (SST) ou movimentos da camada de gelo polar. Esta \n\nt\u00e9cnica pode tamb\u00e9m ser utilizada para gravar eventos a uma escala temporal mais curta, \n\ncomo blooms de fitopl\u00e2ncton e processos de afloramento costeiro. Dado que a macroalga \n\nM. pyrifera forma uma can\u00f3pia densa \u00e0 superf\u00edcie da \u00e1gua do mar, a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de dados \n\nde sat\u00e9lite (capazes de detetar a fluoresc\u00eancia da Clorofila a). Esta ferramenta tornou-se \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nessencial na an\u00e1lise da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o, padr\u00f5es sazonais de crescimento e correla\u00e7\u00e3o das \n\nflorestas de kelp gigante com fen\u00f3menos ambientais como furac\u00f5es ou eventos como o \n\nEl Ni\u00f1o. A an\u00e1lise de climatologias, resumos de uma ou mais vari\u00e1veis (SST ou Clorofila \n\na) em escalas temporais grandes, utiliza modelos de fluxos atmosf\u00e9ricos e oceanogr\u00e1ficos \n\ncom enormes bases de dados e capacidade de processamento dos mesmos (como por \n\nexemplo o sistema de reanalise de dados oceanogr\u00e1ficos ORAS4). Estes aumentam a \n\nquantidade e qualidade dos dados utiliz\u00e1veis para estudar os fatores ambientais que \n\nafetam a esp\u00e9cie em estudo e permitem a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de cen\u00e1rios de hipot\u00e9ticos de altera\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nna distribui\u00e7\u00e3o destas esp\u00e9cies. \n\n O objetivo deste estudo foi procurar evid\u00eancias de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o local a condi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nrepresentativas de stress relacionado com ondas de calor marinhas (temperaturas altas e \n\nbaixa concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de nutrientes) a um n\u00edvel regional numa \u00e1rea que engloba regimes \n\noceanografias diferentes, assim como diferentes grupos gen\u00e9ticos.  \n\nEm 2015, l\u00e2minas de M. pyrifera adultas amostradas a duas profundidades e provenientes \n\nde quatro regi\u00f5es do Pacifico Noroeste foram expostas a um gradiente de \u00e1gua do mar a \n\n3 temperaturas (15, 20 e 24\u00baC) e nutrientes (meio n\u00e3o enriquecido e enriquecido com \n\nProvasoli (PES)) replicados (x3), simulando condi\u00e7\u00f5es similares fen\u00f3menos com o El \n\nNi\u00f1o. Tanques de 30L contendo \u00e1gua do mar filtrada foram equipados com termostatos \n\npara regular a temperatura, bombas de circula\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua e aparelhos de registo de \n\ntemperatura para registar o seu perfil. As condi\u00e7\u00f5es de cultura foram: salinidade a 35ppm, \n\nciclos de 14:10 luz:escuro a 80 ?E\u00b7 m-2\u00b7s-1 e os tratamentos com adi\u00e7\u00e3o de nutrientes \n\nforam enriquecidos com 20 mL\u00b7L-1 PES. \n\nOs resultados das experi\u00eancias revelaram, com grande expressividade, que as popula\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nde kelp gigante do limite sul da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o geogr\u00e1fica no hemisf\u00e9rio norte, expressavam \n\nna sua resposta fotossint\u00e9tica uma maior toler\u00e2ncia ao stress. Comparada com as outras \n\nregi\u00f5es, as l\u00e2minas da superf\u00edcie da regi\u00e3o Sul, demonstraram uma menor perturba\u00e7\u00e3o no \n\naparelho fotossint\u00e9tico com os valores do par\u00e2metro Fv/Fm 15.5% superiores \u00e0 m\u00e9dia \n\nregional, nos tratamentos a 24\u00baC. Tamb\u00e9m na regi\u00e3o Sul, os par\u00e2metros relacionados com \n\nos processos fotossint\u00e9ticos de enzimas termo sens\u00edveis (rETRmax e Ek) foram mais \n\nelevados a 24\u00baC comparativamente com os tratamentos a 20\u00baC, o que n\u00e3o sucedeu nas \n\noutras regi\u00f5es. Nas l\u00e2minas amostradas junto ao fundo, as repostas fotossint\u00e9ticas ao \n\nstress apresentaram maior semelhan\u00e7a entre regi\u00f5es. Espor\u00f3fitos juvenis crescidos em \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nlaborat\u00f3rio, a partir do tecido reprodutivo recolhido nas mesmas popula\u00e7\u00f5es amostradas \n\npara as l\u00e2minas adultas, n\u00e3o exibiram uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o significativa do par\u00e2metro Fv/Fm, \n\nprovavelmente devido \u00e0 temperatura m\u00e1xima utilizada (21\u00baC) a qual n\u00e3o foi \n\nsuficientemente alta para causar stress t\u00e9rmico. No entanto, os par\u00e2metros rETRmax e Ek \n\nforam significativamente mais altos na regi\u00e3o Sul. A regi\u00e3o Norte-Centro (Santa Barbara, \n\nCalif\u00f3rnia) revelou os n\u00edveis mais baixos de resposta fotossint\u00e9tica ao stress em todas as \n\nexperi\u00eancias, incluindo nos espor\u00f3fitos F1. Este facto aponta para uma poss\u00edvel redu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde fitness devido a fatores gen\u00e9ticos. Os nossos resultados real\u00e7am tamb\u00e9m a necessidade \n\nde futuras investiga\u00e7\u00f5es nos efeitos sin\u00e9rgicos de baixa disponibilidade de nutrientes, \n\nassociada a elevadas temperaturas considerando diferentes etapas no ciclo de vida de M. \n\npyrifera. \n\n \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Kelp, esp\u00e9cies, esp\u00e9cies estruturais, altera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas, stress \n\nt\u00e9rmico, adapta\u00e7\u00e3o local \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nContents \n\n \n\n \n\nIntroduction          1 \n\nObjectives          5 \n\n \n\nMaterials and Methods        6 \n\nCommon-garden experiment comparing adult blades (Experiment 1)    7 \n\nOceanographic data         9 \n\nEffect of blade removal on physiological responses: Comparison of entire  \n\nindividuals vs excised blades (Experiment 2)      9 \n\nControl of environmental carry-over effects: Comparison of F1 generation  \n\njuvenile sporophytes (Experiment 3)       10 \n\nStatistical analyses of experimental data       11 \n\n \n\nResults          13 \n\nCommon-garden experiment comparing adult blades (Experiment 1)    13 \n\nMaximum quantum efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm)      15 \n\nLight-limited photosynthetic rates (?)       16 \n\nMaximum electron transport rate (rETRmax)       16 \n\nMinimum saturating irradiance (Ek)       17 \n\nOceanographic data         20 \n\nComparison of entire individuals vs excised blades (Experiment 2)    22 \n\nComparison of F1 generation juvenile sporophytes (Experiment 3)    25 \n\nMaximum quantum efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm)      26 \n\nLight-limited photosynthetic rates (?)       26 \n\nMaximum electron transport rate (rETRmax)       26 \n\nMinimum saturating irradiance (Ek)       27 \n\n \n\nDiscussion          28 \n\nRegional differences and potential for local adaptation     28 \n\nThermal limits          30 \n\nNutrient effects          32 \n\nDepth effects          33 \n\n \n\nConclusions          34 \n\nReferences          35 \n\nAnnexes          46 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nAbbreviations list \n\n \n\nPAM fluorometer - Pulse Amplified Modulated fluorometer \n\nRLC - rapid light curve \n\nPSII - photosystem II \n\nFv/Fm - maximum quantum yield of PSII \n\nETRmax - maximum electron transport rate \n\nrETRmax - relative maximum electron transport rate \n\n? - photosynthetic rate in light-limited region of RLC \n\nEk - minimum saturating irradiance \n\nN \u2013 North \n\nNC - North-Center \n\nSC - South-Center \n\nS - South \n\nSW - seawater \n\nRuBisCO - Ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase \n\nANOVA - Analysis of variance \n\nGLM - Generalized Linear Models \n\nATP - adenosine triphosphate \n\nVmax - maximum rate of enzymatic reaction \n\nKm - substrate affinity \n\n?PSII - effective quantum yield of PSII \n\nSST - sea surface temperature \n\nChl a - chlorophyll a \n\nMHWs - Marine Heat Waves \n\nPES - Provasoli Enriched Seawater \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n1 \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\nTemperature is a major physical factor that defines the biogeographic distribution of species \n\nin the marine environment (Adey &amp; Steneck, 2001; Poloczanska et al., 2007; Wernberg et \n\nal., 2016). Species range distributions are usually associated with a center where conditions \n\nare optimal and the edges where those conditions are no longer met (Lomolino et al., 2006). \n\nThermal limits occur where organisms can no longer tolerate continuous temperature \n\nconditions in the environment or their fluctuations (Garrabou et al., 2009; Mohring et al., \n\n2014). While temperature change across the latitudinal range can be broadly contiguous, \n\nenvironmental factors such movement of air masses, ocean currents, hurricanes, upwelling \n\nand internal waves provide extreme complexity to the marine environment resulting in great \n\nspatial (from meters to hundreds of kilometers) and temporal (from hours to decades) thermal \n\nvariability (Adey &amp; Steneck, 2001).  \n\nCompelling evidence on environmental and species distribution changes due to global \n\nclimate change have greatly increased over the last decades (Selig et al., 2010; Wernberg et \n\nal., 2012a; Rosenzweig &amp; Neofotis, 2013; Caputi et al., 2015). In a decadal review of \n\nscientific experiments related to climate change on marine organisms, Wernberg et al., \n\n(2012b) found that virtually all experiments showed significant effects of stress related to \n\nincreased temperatures. The frequency of high seawater temperature anomalies on nearshore \n\necosystems has increased 38% (Lima &amp; Wethey, 2012) resulting in a mean temperature \n\nincrease of 0.5-1\u00baC (Hawkins et al., 2003; Ridgway, 2007). Thus, extreme events like marine \n\nheatwaves (MHWs) characterized by a sudden significant increase of seawater temperature \n\n(but see Hobday et al., 2016 for a recent detailed and hierarchical definition) are increasing \n\nin frequency, duration and intensity (Perkins, 2011; Hobday et al., 2016). Examples of such \n\nevents are the northern Mediterranean Sea marine heat wave (MHW) of 2003 (Garrabou et \n\nal., 2009) or the 2014 positive temperature anomalies on the NE and equatorial Pacific that \n\nled to the extreme magnitude of the 2015/16 El Ni\u00f1o (Bond et al., 2015; Levine &amp; Mcphaden, \n\n2016). MHWs are caused by the interaction of atmospheric and oceanographic processes that \n\ncan encompasses different geographical (local, regional and global) and temporal (seasonal, \n\nyearly, decadal) scales (Trenberth, 2012; Hobday et al., 2016).  \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\nThese events are also affecting larger areas of the globe, threatening several marine \n\necosystems and key species (Lima &amp; Wethey, 2012; Wernberg et al., 2012a). Coral reefs are \n\namong the most sensitive ecosystems to anthropogenic related environmental changes \n\n(Halpern et al., 2007) and recent extreme MHWs caused extensive bleaching and disease \n\n(Selig et al., 2010; Smale &amp; Wernberg, 2012b). Seagrass meadows (e.g Posidonia oceanica) \n\nalso responded negatively after the two extreme MHWs events (2003 and 2006) in the \n\nMediterranean when shoot mortality rates exceeded recruitment (Marb\u00e0 &amp; Duarte, 2010). \n\nSimilar results were obtained in a laboratory experiment mimicking an ocean warming \n\nscenario on the seagrass Zostera noltii, with reduced photosynthetic performance and shoot \n\ndensity (Repolho et al., 2017). Species with great economic relevance such as lobsters and \n\nscallops were also affected by the loss of habitat and direct thermal stress resulting in \n\nincreased mortality, individual size reduction and reproductive rates (Mills et al., 2013; \n\nCaputi et al., 2015). Kelp forests and fucoid beds have also registered negative effects caused \n\nby rising seawater temperature events on fundamental processes such as growth, \n\nreproduction, recruitment and resilience to disturbances  (Ladah &amp; Zertuche-Gonz\u00e1lez, 2007; \n\nPearson et al., 2009 ; Wernberg et al., 2012a; Nicastro et al., 2013; Jueterbock et al., 2014; \n\nMota et al., 2015) \n\nPhotosynthesis is greatly influenced by temperature (Raven &amp; Geider, 1988; Kirk, 2011) \n\nwhich regulates the rate of enzymatic reactions and solute movements within algal cells \n\n(Raven &amp; Geider, 1988; Davison, 1991; Tamburic et al., 2014) and has been successfully \n\nused to quantify the effects of temperature increase on kelps (Henkel &amp; Hofmann, 2008; \n\nWernberg et al., 2010). While low temperatures reduce photosystem 2 (PSII) activity (Baker, \n\n1991), high temperatures can result in protein denaturation and damage to the membrane \n\nsystems of the photosynthetic apparatus (Daniel et al., 1996). Thus, photosynthesis is often \n\nused as an indicator for algal stress response to temperature (Hurd et al., 2014). As \n\nphotosynthesis depends on the electron transport rate (ETR) in order to maintain cellular \n\nredox balance, metabolic homeostasis, and energy production (ATP) for the organism, this \n\nsystem is highly conservative in response to environmental (e.g temperature oscillations) and \n\nphysiological changes (McDonald et al., 2011). The other facet of photosynthesis, i.e., the \n\nCalvin cycle biochemical pathway through which inorganic carbon is fixed, is temperature \n\ndependent via effects on enzyme activity. Moderate temperature increase may enhance \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nphotosynthesis by increasing maximum rates of enzymatic activity, beyond which further \n\ntemperature increase may reduce the maximum rate (Vmax) and/or substrate affinity (Km) of \n\nkey enzymes such as RuBisCO. Limitation of photosynthetic process by inorganic carbon \n\navailability, carbonic anhydrase activity, diffusion and active transport of CO2 across the \n\nchloroplast membrane may also occur at higher non-acclimated temperatures, contributing \n\nto declining photosynthetic rates (Davison, 1991). \n\nOne of the most commonly used methods to measure photosynthetic responses in \n\necophysiological research is the Pulse Amplified Modulated (PAM) fluorometer, as it can \n\nefficiently determine photosynthetic rates in laboratory and field conditions (Beer et al., \n\n1998; Ralph &amp; Gademann, 2005; Roleda et al., 2009; Terada et al., 2016). These instruments \n\ngenerally have built-in software routines allowing efficient measurement of the maximum \n\nquantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm), or the effective quantum yield of PSII under illumination \n\n(?PSII). ?PSII together with information on illumination can be used to construct \n\nphotosynthesis-irradiance curves, often as \u201crapid light curves\u201d (RLCs) when illumination \n\nsteps are given briefly (over several seconds). Declining Fv/Fm  values imply a reduction in \n\nthe maximum quantum yield of PSII photochemistry and therefore disturbance (short term \n\nphotoacclimation) or damage to the photosynthetic apparatus (Lichtenthaler et al., 2005).  \n\nRLCs are a powerful tool that provide more detailed information on the maximum electron \n\ntransport rate (ETRmax), while the initial slope (?) of the RLC provides information about the \n\nrelative efficiency of (PSII) photochemistry and the minimum saturating irradiance (Ek) \n\nreveal the dominance of photochemical quenching (Ralph &amp; Gademann, 2005) and can be \n\nused as a photoacclimation indicator (Sakshaug et al., 1997).  \n\nThe giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera (L.) C.A. Agardh is the most widely distributed kelp \n\ntaxon in the oceans, distributed through the northeast and southeast Pacific Ocean, in the \n\nsouthwest Atlantic Ocean, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and also around most sub-\n\nAntarctic Islands (Graham et al., 2007)). It has an heteromorphic life cycle in which the \n\nmicroscopic haploid gametophyte (male and female) alternates with a micro and macroscopic \n\ndiploid sporophyte (Ladah &amp; Zertuche-Gonz\u00e1lez, 2007; Graham &amp; Halpern, 2008). M. \n\npyrifera forms dense forests with thick canopy at the water surface where the majority of the \n\nsporophyte biomass is located (Nyman et al., 1993; Graham et al., 2007), resulting in high \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nnet primary production (NPP) between 0.42 and 2.38 kg dry mass m-2 y-1 (Graham &amp; \n\nHalpern, 2008). While this productivity feeds secondary production via direct grazing, most \n\nof this carbon follows the detrital pathway or is exported (Graham, 2004;  Dean et al., 1984). \n\nDue to their size, density and primary production, M. pyrifera forests are able to modify the \n\nlocal environmental conditions providing a heterogeneous habitat which can harbour a high \n\nnumber of species (Santelices &amp; Ojeda, 1984; Graham, 2004). Therefore, this species serves \n\nas a foundation species in ecosystems that are of great ecological and economic importance \n\n(Lee et al., 2009; Graham et al., 2007; Byrnes et al., 2011). \n\nDue to the great importance of M. pyrifera as a structuring species in the Northeast Pacific, \n\nseveral studies have been conducted in recent years to understand the oceanographic \n\nprocesses affecting geographical range and genetic diversity of this species (Alberto et al., \n\n2010, 2011; Bell et al., 2015; Johansson et al., 2015). Across the broad latitudinal distribution \n\nof M. pyrifera in the Northeast Pacific, regionally heterogeneous environmental conditions \n\nraise the hypothesis that populations may be locally adapted. In general, adaptive genetic \n\nresponses to the environment can occur on a time scale of years to hundreds of years (Crispo \n\net al., 2010). Examples of local adaptation to warmer and nutrient limited sea-water were \n\nalready described for example in Fucus serratus (Jueterbock et al., 2014); but see Pearson et \n\nal (2009) for potential mal-adaptation in the same species)  and coral reef endosymbionts \n\n(Howells et al., 2012). \n\nThe use of remote sensing techniques such as oceanographic buoys and satellite data has \n\ngreatly increased our knowledge of the marine environment as continuous observations allow \n\nfor pattern analysis of relevant factors (e.g. sea surface temperature (SST) oscillations, ice \n\nshelf movements) and can record short-lived events (e.g. phytoplankton blooms, upwelling \n\nevent) (Joint &amp; Groom, 2000; Paolo et al., 2015). Because M. pyrifera forms dense canopies \n\nat the water surface where most of the adult sporophyte biomass is located (Nyman et al., \n\n1993; Graham et al., 2007) remote sensing by satellite data analysis has become a \n\nfundamental tool to assess kelp forest distribution, seasonal growth and correlation with \n\nenvironmental phenomena like hurricanes or El Ni\u00f1o events (North et al., 1993; Graham et \n\nal., 2007; Cavanaugh et al., 2013). The analysis of climatologies (long-term summary of a \n\nsingle or multiple variables (e.g. SST, Chl a), ocean models, atmospheric forcing fluxes and \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\noceanographic observations by data integration in reanalysis systems (e.g. ocean reanalysis \n\nsystem ORAS4) provide improved quality controlled data sets that can be used to assess how \n\nenvironmental conditions affect target species and  provide plausible scenarios concerning \n\nspecies range distribution shifts (Lee et al., 2009 ; Balmaseda et al., 2013) \n\nUnderstanding the physiological responses of M. pyrifera to stress conditions will help to \n\npredict and possibly minimize reductions in range distribution. Although several studies have \n\nfocused on the response of M. pyrifera to thermal stress (North &amp; Zimmerman, 1984; \n\nDeyseher &amp; Dean, 1986; Rothausler et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2013) a regional comparison \n\nbetween population responses that encompass areas with different oceanographic regimes \n\nand genetic groups has yet to be performed. \n\n \n\nObjectives: \n\nThis study aims to test for evidence of local adaptation to conditions representative of heat \n\nwaves in the field (i.e., concurrent high temperature and low nutrient [inorganic N] stress) in \n\npopulations of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera at its southern limit in the northern \n\nhemisphere, in a region that encompasses distinct genetic groups and biogeographic thermal \n\nbarriers, by comparing southern limit populations with those near the center of the range. \n\nThis aim is approached by comparing ecophysiological responses of adult blades and F1 \n\njuvenile sporophytes from eight populations representing four distinct genetic regions. \n\n  \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nMaterials and Methods \n\nIn all tasks, the model used was the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera in the northeast Pacific \n\nbetween Baja California, Mexico and central California, U.S.A., an area covering around \n\n1300 km of coastline that includes major biogeographic and thermal transition zones (Fig 1). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure1: Locations of the 8 populations (2 populations per region) sampled along the coast of California, USA \n\n(regions North, North-Center) and Baja California, Mexico (regions South-Center and South) (see Annex I for \n\ncoordinates).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nCommon-garden experiment comparing adult blades (Experiment 1) \n\nOn June 18, 2015, adult M. pyrifera blades were simultaneously sampled by SCUBA diving \n\nfrom two populations within each of 4 regions in the northeast Pacific: 1) north (N) (Santa \n\nCruz), 2) north-center (NC) (Santa Barbara) - both in the U.S.A, and 3) south-center (SC) \n\n(Ensenada) and 4) south (S) (Punta Eugenia) in Baja California, Mexico (Fig. 1, see Annex \n\nI for coordinates). Populations within a region were not very distant, but direct gene flow is \n\nexpected to be low based on gaps in habitat continuity between populations (Alberto et al., \n\n2010). From each population, 54 blades were sampled from the surface and 54 blades near \n\nthe bottom (at depth 15-20 m). In addition, 10 reproductive blades (sporophylls) were \n\nsampled for subsequent spore release. Blades were cleaned of epiphytes using paper towels, \n\nthen packed in moistened paper towels and wrapped in aluminum foil. All blades were \n\ntransported to Ensenada in cool-boxes packed with ice for the laboratory experiment and \n\narrived within 24 h of collection. Samples from the Ensenada area were collected, prepared \n\nand stored in a similar way, to avoid transportation effects. Immediately on arrival at the \n\nlaboratory, adult sporophyte blades were acclimated for 24h at 15 \u00baC in 20 mL\u00b7L-1 Provasoli \n\nseawater (SW) medium (PES; Provasoli, 1968) (Anderson, 2005). \n\nThe experimental design consisted of a replicated (\u00d73) gradient of SW temperatures (15, 20, \n\n24 \u00baC) and nutrients (non-enriched or enriched SW with PES SW medium), simulating a \n\nrange of environmental conditions including El Ni\u00f1o (Fig. 2).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2: Experimental design. Acclimation for 24 h (15 \u00baC, with nutrients) followed by transfer of blades to 3 \n\nreplicates of each of 3 temperature treatment (15, 20, 24\u00baC) with enriched and non-enriched seawater with PES. \n\nFor each treatment condition (temperature and nutrients) a total of 3 blades per population (8 populations) x 2 \n\ndepths (surface and bottom) were used. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nTanks containing 30 L filtered SW were equipped with thermostats to regulate temperature, \n\npumps for water circulation and temperature loggers to record thermal profiles. Culture \n\nconditions were 14:10h light:dark cycle, 80 ?E\u00b7 m-2\u00b7s-1 and treatments with nutrients were \n\nenriched with 20 mL\u00b7L-1 PES (Anderson, 2005) at 35 ppm salinity. Blades were placed inside \n\nlarge open-mesh (1 cm) bags to allow individual identification throughout the experiment \n\nwhile not significantly reducing light and water circulation reaching the blades. Three blades \n\nper population (and from each depth within that population) were placed in each treatment \n\ntank. The maximum temperature (24\u00baC) was selected based on climatology analysis of the \n\nsites and thermal limits reported on literature (Hernandez-Carmona et al., 2001; Ladah &amp; \n\nZertuche-Gonz\u00e1lez, 2007; Rothausler et al., 2009) \n\nThe following physiological measurements were taken using a pulse amplified modulated \n\n(PAM) fluorometer (Diving PAM, Waltz, Germany) during the course of the experiment to \n\nallow a continuous assessment of the condition and stress responses of the algae: Fv/Fm (the \n\nmaximum yield of photosystem 2 (PSII) photochemistry), and rapid light curves \n\n(photosynthesis versus irradiance curves from relative electron transport rates [rETR], \n\ncalculated from PSII yield [?F/Fm] at each irradiance level). Fv/Fm measurements and \n\nobservation of blade condition were performed every 24h (starting at 12h) to determine if \n\nsampling was required due to tissue degradation (at higher temperatures). If so, rapid light \n\ncurves were performed and tissue from each individual blade was sampled for gene \n\nexpression. Tissue samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and later lyophilized in order \n\nto preserve tissue for RNA extraction. Diving PAM settings for the RLCs were the following: \n\nlight curve intensity (LC-INT = 2), duration of each step (LC-WIDTH = 10seconds) and \n\nactinity light list for each step (1, 19, 45, 70, 94, 138, 219, 278 and 444). These settings \n\nallowed a plateau in the rETR curve to be reached (i.e., saturated photosynthesis and in some \n\ncases photoinhibitory decline at the highest irradiance (Ralph &amp; Gademann, 2005). RLC \n\ncalibration was performed prior to the experiment using separate M. pyrifera blade samples. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nOceanographic data: \n\nWe analyzed local oceanographic features of each region prior to and during the sampling \n\nevent for evaluation in light of the physiological results. Ocean temperature data were \n\ncompiled on a daily basis at two depths (surface and 20 m) for each region. Data were derived \n\nfrom the Global Ocean Physics Reanalysis ECMWF ORAP5.0 (1979-2013), which uses a \n\n3D model (NEMOVAR) with a bias correction scheme that combines satellite data and in \n\nsitu measurements, for a spatial resolution of 0.25 degree x 75 depth levels (Balmaseda et \n\nal., 2015; Zuo &amp; Balmaseda, 2015; Zuo et al., 2015). Bilinear interpolation was used to \n\nestimate the temperatures of each sampling site (e.g., Assis et al., 2016).  An anomalously \n\nwarm event (heat wave) was defined similarly to Hobday et al. (2016) as five or more days \n\nof temperatures warmer than the 90th percentile of a historical baseline climatology, which \n\nin our study was considered for the period 1993-2015. The climatology was defined relative \n\nto the time of year, using all data within an 11-day window centered on the time of year from \n\nwhich the climatological threshold was calculated. The high percentile threshold (e.g. 90%) \n\nwas used rather than an absolute value above the climatological value as the magnitude of \n\nvariability across a range of timescales varies considerably by region (Hobday et al., 2016). \n\n \n\nEffect of blade removal on physiological responses: Comparison of entire individuals vs \n\nexcised blades (Experiment 2) \n\nIn adult Macrocystis pyrifera sporophytes, photosynthesis is mostly performed at the canopy \n\nsurface and the resulting products (mannitol and aminoacids) are translocated downwards to \n\nthe youngest blades, meristems, holdfasts and sporophylls (Schmitz &amp; Grant, 1979). As \n\ntranslocation in M. pyrifera is not fully understood, an experiment was designed in order to \n\nunderstand if individual responses to thermal stress (i.e. entire individuals, in this case small \n\njuveniles due to logistic constrains) differ from those of juvenile and adult excised blades. A \n\ntotal of 24 juveniles (smaller than 40 cm), 40 juvenile blades and 40 adult bottom blades from \n\nM. pyrifera sporophytes were collected from the Campo Kennedy population, in the South-\n\ncenter region. Two temperatures (16 and 24 \u00baC) and nutrients concentration (non-enriched \n\nand enriched PES-enriched SW) were used with 2 \u00d7 replicates per treatment. We used a lower \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nnumber of juveniles to minimize any population impact caused by the removal of young \n\nsporophytes. Culture conditions were replicated from the first experiment (see above) and \n\nFv/Fm measurements were taken every 12h using the diving PAM fluorometer using the same \n\nsettings as in the first experiment. \n\n \n\nControl of environmental carry-over effects: Comparison of F1 generation juvenile \n\nsporophytes (Experiment 3) \n\nA third experiment was designed in order to assess the ecophysiological responses of first \n\nfilial (F1) generation sporophytes to thermal stress given a common growth history in vitro. \n\nGametophytes developed from spores released from 10 fertile sporophylls per population \n\nused in Experiment 1were grown vegetatively in 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks with 4 mL\u00b7L-1 \n\nof PES (Anderson, 2005) without iron, 35 ppm salinity, 20 ?E\u00b7 m-2\u00b7s-1 red light (LEE filters, \n\n#026 bright red) and aeration at 15\u00baC. \n\nOn February 2017 a gametophyte mass from each population was manually separated into \n\nthe smallest pieces possible using forceps. The fragments were seeded onto a spool of cotton \n\nfilament and left for 2h in air under cool (15\u00baC) and humid conditions to allow attachment. \n\nSeeded spools for each population were then placed separately into 20 L tanks with aerated \n\nseawater (SW) and weekly increasing concentrations of PES (6, 10, 15, 20 mL\u00b7L-1) \n\ncontaining iron.  Incubations proceeded under white light (20, 40 60 80 ?E\u00b7 m-2\u00b7s-1) and 14:10 \n\nh light:dark cycle. Seawater and tanks were changed/cleaned weekly to maintain optimal \n\nculture conditions. When sporophytes were ca. 1 cm length they were gently removed from \n\nthe line using forceps and grown detached with aeration (see Westermeier et al., 2006) in the \n\nsame 20 L tanks. When sporophytes reached 6 to 10 cm they were transferred to the \n\nexperimental setup. This constituted a temperature gradient (15, 17, 19 and 21\u00baC) in PES-\n\nenriched SW, with 3 replicates of 5 sporophytes per final temperature. A 24 h ramp between \n\neach temperature increase was used to avoid excessive stress on the small juvenile \n\nsporophytes. All individuals were initially at 15\u00baC, at 24 h all individuals were transferred to \n\n17\u00baC except the 15\u00baC treatment, and so on up to 21\u00baC. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nRapid light curves (RCLs) were performed every 24 h for 5 days using a diving PAM. \n\nExperimental conditions were: 10 L tanks with aeration, SW with 20 mL\u00b7L-1 PES with iron, \n\n80 ?E\u00b7 m-2\u00b7s-1 white light and 14:10 h light:dark cycle. Diving PAM settings for the RLCs \n\nwere adjusted for the lower light conditions in the laboratory: light curve intensity (LC-INT \n\n= 2), duration of each step (LC-WIDTH = 10 s) and actinity light list for each step (0, 5, 18, \n\n30, 42, 69, 97, 133 and 195 \u00b5mol.m-2.s-1). All individuals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen \n\nafter 120 h. An additional 15 individuals were also flash-frozen at the beginning and another \n\n15 at the end of the experiment for a transcriptomic baseline. Due to sporophyte growth \n\nproblems in one of the NC populations and no sporophyte recruitment in one of the S \n\npopulations, these two regions only had one replicate population. The 17\u00baC treatment and the \n\nNC region at 24 h were removed from the data analysis as temperature fluctuations were \n\nrecorded in the 17\u00baC culture chamber, resulting in inconsistent ecophysiological responses \n\nand potentially compromising the data analysis and interpretation. \n\n \n\nStatistical analyses of experimental data \n\nIn order to assess ecophysiological responses to temperature and nutrients in M. pyrifera \n\nfrom different regions, generalized linear models were used (GLMs; McCullagh &amp; Nelder, \n\n1989). \n\nExperiment 1) - Adult blades: Four levels of the factor \u201cRegion\u201d (N, NC, SC, and S), three \n\nlevels of the factor \u201cTemperature\u201d (15, 20 and 24\u00baC), two levels of the factor \u201cNutrients\u201d \n\n(PES-enriched and non-enriched SW) and two levels of the factor \u201cDepth\u201d (surface and \n\nbottom) were used as fixed effects. The response variables were minimum saturating \n\nirradiance (Ek), maximum potential relative ETR (rETRmax) and the photosynthetic rate in \n\nlight-limited region of RLC (?), and the maximum quantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm).  All \n\nparameters were estimated from the rapid light curves (computed with rPackage phytotools \n\n(Silsbe &amp; Sairah, 2015, CRAN repository), by fitting the model of Platt et al (1980). Analysis \n\nof variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc tests (Tukey Honest Significant differences (HSD)) were \n\nused to analyze the differences amongst treatments using R software (R Development Core \n\nTeam, 2008). Fv/Fm and ? were square root transformed to approximate residuals to a normal \n\ndistribution.  Since only a short acclimation period was possible, and to minimize any effects \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nof transportation on physiological responses, data from the RLCs were analyzed at the end \n\npoint of the respective temperature treatments. \n\nExperiment 2) - Entire individual vs removed blade: ANOVA and post-hoc tests (Tukey HSD) \n\nwere used to analyze the difference between treatments using Fv/Fm as the variable for two \n\nlevels of factor \u201cTemperature\u201d (16 and 24\u00baC), two levels of the factor \u201cNutrients\u201d (PES-\n\nenriched and non-enriched seawater) and three levels of factor \u201cTissue\u201d (juvenile, juvenile \n\nblade and adult blade). Fv/Fm was square rooted transformed and the GLMs fitted using the \n\nGaussian family (highest AIC) and resulting residuals were approximate to the normal \n\ndistribution. \n\nExperiment 3) - F1 generation juvenile sporophytes: Four levels of the factor \u201cRegion\u201d (N, \n\nNC, SC and S), three levels of the factor \u201cTemperature\u201d (15, 19 and 21\u00baC) and two levels of \n\nthe factor \u201cNutrients\u201d (PES-enriched and non-enriched SW) were used as fixed effects with \n\nthe response variables ?, Ek, ETRmax (estimated by the Diving PAM software Win-Control \n\n3, Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany) and Fv/Fm. GLMs were fitted using the Gaussian family \n\ndistribution for all variables (selected by AIC comparison with the available distributions for \n\nR). The variable Fv/Fm was square root transformed and residuals were approximate to the \n\nnormal distribution. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey (HSD) were used to analyze \n\nthe differences amongst treatments using R software (R Development Core Team, 2008). For \n\nthe first and third experiments, we used populations within the same region as a replicate for \n\nthat region. \n\n  \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nResults \n\n \n\nCommon-garden experiment comparing adult blades (Experiment 1) \n\nOur results showed that Macrocystis pyrifera blades from all regions performed well at 15\u00baC \n\nand 20\u00baC but were rapidly stressed at 24\u00baC. At this temperature, more than 88 % of the blades \n\nhad lower mean Fv/Fm values compared with the other treatments. At 24\u00baC there was tissue \n\ndegradation (e.g. necrotic tissue and loss of pigmentation) and mucilage production. \n\nTherefore, the experimental treatments at this temperature had to be terminated earlier while \n\nat the other temperatures the blades remained in culture in good condition. Rapid light curves \n\n(RLCs) parameters (?, Ek and rETRmax) and Fv/Fm measured at the end point of each \n\ntemperature treatment confirmed that 24\u00baC treatment rapidly stressed M. pyrifera blades (Fig. \n\n3). Since no main effect or interactions involving nutrients were detected, non-enriched and \n\nPES-enriched treatments were combined for the plots in Figure 3. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\nSurface Bottom \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\nNorth North-Center South-Center South\n\nFv/Fm\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\nNorth North-Center South-Center South\n\nFv/Fm\n15\u00b0C\n\n20\u00b0C\n\n24\u00b0C\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\nNorth North-Center South-Center South\n\n?\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\nNorth North-Center South-Center South\n\n?\n15\u00b0C\n\n20\u00b0C\n\n24\u00b0C\n\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\n120\n\n150\n\nNorth North-Center South-Center South\n\nrETRmax\n\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\n120\n\n150\n\nNorth North-Center South-Center South\n\nrETRmax\n15\u00b0C\n\n20\u00b0C\n\n24\u00b0C\n\n70\n\n90\n\n110\n\n130\n\n150\n\n170\n\nNorth North-Center South-Center South\n\nEk\n\n70\n\n90\n\n110\n\n130\n\n150\n\n170\n\nNorth North-Center South-Center South\n\nEk 15\u00b0C\n\n20\u00b0C\n\n24\u00b0C\n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nFigure  3: Maximum quantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm), photosynthetic rate in light-limited region of RLC (?), \n\nrelative maximum electron transport rate (rETRmax) and minimum saturating irradiance (Ek) mean values (\u00b1 \n\nmean standard error) for 3 temperatures (15, 20, 24\u00baC) and 4 regions (North, North-Center, South-Center and \n\nSouth) of adult blades over time. Different letters indicate significant differences among temperatures within \n\neach region and variable using Tukey HSD. \n\n \n\nMaximum quantum efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) \n\nDecreasing values of Fv/Fm can provide a rapid indication of stress affecting PS II in the dark-\n\nadapted state. With Fv/Fm as response variable, ANOVA indicated signification interactions \n\ndue to Region x Temperature, Temperature x Depth and Region x Depth (Table 1). \n\nThe interaction between Region x Temperature revealed significant differences between \n\nregions in the response to thermal stress: In the N, NC, and SC regions, Fv/Fm was lower at \n\n24\u00baC than at either 20\u00baC or 15\u00baC (and attributable mainly to stress in surface blades), but in \n\nthe S region significantly lower Fv/Fm was only detected between 24\u00baC and 15\u00baC (p = 0.040). \n\nThe region differences were clear when responses at 24\u00baC between regions at 24\u00baC were \n\nconsidered; Fv/Fm was higher at 24\u00baC in the S versus either SC or NC regions (p = 9.5 x 10\n-5 \n\nand 2.3 x 10-6, respectively), but was marginally insignificant between S and N regions (p = \n\n0.066).  \n\nPost-hoc tests (Tukey HSD) indicated that the interaction between Temperature x Depth (i.e., \n\nsurface and bottom blades) was due to greater resilience of Fv/Fm in bottom blades at 20\u00baC \n\nand 24\u00baC (p = 0.001929 and p &lt;0.0001, respectively), while in 15\u00baC control conditions no \n\ndifferences in blade sampling depth were detected (p > 0.25).  \n\nFinally, the interaction between Region x Depth was due to significant contrasts involving \n\nsurface blades between regions; more specifically Fv/Fm in NC surface blades was lower \n\noverall than in all other regions (NC &lt;N, p = 0.00136; NC &lt;SC, p = 0.00027; NC &lt;S, p = \n\n8 x 10-7). In addition, bottom blades had significantly greater Fv/Fm than surface blades in the \n\nN and NC regions, but not in the SC or S (Fig. 3). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\nLight-limited photosynthetic rates (?) \n\nAnalysis of ? values revealed a significant interaction between Region x Temperature x \n\nDepth and post-hoc tests (Tukey HSD) highlighted that regional differences regarding the \n\nresponse to thermal stress (24\u00baC) were due to significantly higher ? values on the S region \n\nsurface blades compared to NC and SC regions (p = 7.19 x 10-5 and p = 2.82 x 10-5, \n\nrespectively) as other interactions were non-significant (p > 0.275). The response to thermal \n\nstress of the S region surface blades showed surprising stress tolerance, as all post-hoc tests \n\nbetween surface blades at 24\u00baC and either 15 or 20\u00baC temperatures were non-significant (p > \n\n0.742), indicating that ? was little affected over this temperature range. The same contrasts \n\nwere significant for all other regions (p ? 0.00023 in all cases). Also all regional comparisons \n\nbetween the 24\u00baC treatments for the bottom blades were non-significant (p ? 0.698). The \n\neffect of the 24\u00baC surface blades on the interaction was also attested by the  analysis of the ? \n\nvalues between and within the 15\u00baC control and 20\u00baC that showed no significant differences \n\nbetween or within depths considering all possible  regional combinations (total 120 \n\ncombinations) with only one residual significant value (p = 0.046) . Because both ? and Fv/Fm \n\nrepresent aspects of photosynthetic efficiency (Kirk, 2011), the values reported were quite \n\nsimilar among temperatures within each region (Fig. 3). \n\n \n\nMaximum electron transport rate (rETRmax) \n\nBlades from all regions (exception for the S region surface blades) followed the same pattern \n\nin both depths as rETRmax values were higher at 20\u00baC, indicating increased photosynthetic \n\nperformance when exposed to 20\u00baC and photosynthetic inhibition by thermal stress when \n\nexposed to 24\u00baC (Fig. 3).The post-hoc analysis of the interaction Region x Depth indicated \n\nthat the significant regional differences were cause by significantly lower values in NC \n\nsurface blades compared to other regions from the same depth (NC &lt;N, p &lt;0.001; NC &lt;SC, \n\np = 0.002; NC &lt;S, p &lt;0.001); no significant contrasts were found between regions when \n\nanalyzing the blades collected from the bottom (p > 0.257). Treatment temperatures (e.g. 15, \n\n20 and 24\u00baC) differed significantly, with 18.5% and 29.5% higher rETRmax values in blades \n\nat 20\u00baC, when compared to 15\u00baC and 24\u00baC, respectively (p &lt;0.001) and 11% higher at 15\u00baC \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nthan at 24\u00baC (p &lt;0.001). Again, the S region surface blades showed tolerance to thermal \n\nstress (i.e. 24\u00baC) with no significant differences in rETRmax compared at 24\u00baC compared with \n\n20\u00baC and 15\u00baC (Fig. 3) (p = 1.000). \n\n \n\nMinimum saturating irradiance (Ek) \n\nThe ANOVA analysis of Ek for adult blades showed a significant main effect for \n\nTemperature, and a significant interaction between Region x Depth (i.e., blade type). The \n\npatterns of the response were similar to ETRmax with a clear peak at 20\u00baC for the majority of \n\nthe regions (Fig. 3). The Region x Depth interaction (Table 1) resulted from significantly \n\nlower Ek values in NC surface blades (96.3) compared to the N (130.4407), SC (124.069) \n\nand S (134.25) regions (all p ? 0.001) and no significant differences were found between \n\nsurface blades for the other 3 regions (p > 0.824). Regional comparisons for Ek in bottom \n\nblades were non-significant (p > 0.438). At 20\u00baC, Ek values were 19.6% and 20.8% higher \n\noverall compared to 15\u00baC and 24\u00baC, respectively (p &lt;0.001 for both comparisons), while no \n\nsignificant differences were found between 15\u00baC and 24\u00baC (p = 0.783). This result clearly \n\ndemonstrates the thermal dependence of Ek with a peak near 20\u00baC in N, NC, and SC regions. \n\nIn contrast, Ek for S region surface blades was temperature independent across the thermal \n\nrange tested, with no significant differences detected (all p = 1.000; Fig. 3). The thermal \n\ndependence of both Ek and ETRmax is expected, since they are governed by the rate of \n\nenzymatic processes, and our results suggest that S region blades were better able to adjust \n\nphotosynthetic rates across a broad temperature range between 15-24\u00baC, in contrast to surface \n\nblades from more northerly regions. \n\nThe overall picture that emerged was that the NC region (Santa Barbara, Southern CA) was \n\nparticularly sensitive to thermal effects on Fv/Fm, particular for surface blades.  Overall, \n\nbottom blades showed greater resilience than surface blades. There was also a clear tendency \n\nin the S region towards thermal stress resilience, followed, surprisingly, by N regional \n\npopulations (Santa Cruz, Central CA). \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\nTable 1: Four-way ANOVA for the effects of Region, Temperature, Nutrients and Depth on the maximum \n\nquantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm), photosynthetic rate in light-limited region of RLC (?), maximum electron \n\ntransport rate (ETRmax) and minimum saturating irradiance (Ek) mean values of adult blades.

The ANOVA showed an interaction between \n\nTemperature x Nutrients and a significant main effect for the factor Tissue (Table 3). The \n\npost-hoc analysis (Tukey HSD) on the factor Tissue (i.e. juvenile, excised juvenile and adult \n\nblades) indicated no significant differences between the entire juvenile and the juvenile blade \n\n(p = 0.995), supporting the experiment design using excised blades in Experiment 1. Also in \n\nthis analysis, significantly higher Fv/Fm values were found for adult blades (0.766) when \n\ncompared with entire juvenile (0.737) and juvenile blade (0.736) (p = 0.0000065 and p = \n\n0.0000001, respectively). Post-hoc tests (Tukey HSD) indicated that the interaction between \n\nTemperature x Nutrients was due to higher temperature as tissue at 24\u00baC in enriched SW had \n\nsignificant lower Fv/Fm values than 16\u00baC non-enriched and by nutrients when temperatures \n\nwere at 24\u00baC (see Annex II for mean values and p-values).

No significant differences were found within the \n\ngroups (N-NC, p = 0.836 and SC-S, p = 0.999).  At 15\u00baC, a strong reduction in Ek was \n\nobserved at 96 h, but interestingly S region sporophytes Ek values continued to increase, \n\nbeing at least 32.33% higher than the other regions. \n\n \n\nTable 4: Two-way ANOVA for the effects of Region and Temperature on the maximum quantum yield of PSII \n\n(Fv/Fm), photosynthetic rate in light-limited region of RLC (?), maximum electron transport rate (ETRmax) and \n\nminimum saturating irradiance (Ek) mean values of F1 juvenile sporophytes.

This suggests an important \n\neffect of the highly selective thermal conditions of the southernmost kelp habitat. This better \n\nperformance of South (S) region populations was more clearly seen in the blades collected at \n\nthe water surface, which were able to maintain similar maximum electron transport rate \n\n(ETRmax) values at temperatures between 15-24\u00baC, and in contrast to more northerly \n\npopulations. The rather clear patterns of thermal tolerance in the S region surface blades was \n\nmuch less evident in blades from deeper waters (bottom blades), the responses of which were \n\nrather similar between regions.  \n\nGiven the constraints of the experiment, in particular the short pre-acclimation period, these \n\ndifferences can either be attributed to intrinsic (i.e., genetically-determined) variation, or to \n\nplasticity induced by an environmental history of higher temperatures in southern surface \n\nwaters (up to 20\u00baC; Fig. 4). Wave height increase might also have impacted the kelp forests \n\nof the south region as the hurricane Blanca, the second of the season, moved near the \n\npopulations two weeks before our sampling campaign. In the field, the southern population \n\n(Bahia Tortugas) had a lower canopy cover (sparse distribution of individuals) and showed \n\nsigns of greater stress (lower pigmentation, damaged tissue) compared with populations in \n\nmore northern regions. The differences observed between the S and SC regions are all the \n\nmore intriguing given that genetic analysis with microsatellites (neutral genetic markers) \n\nindicated that these two regions form a single genetic cluster (Johansson et al., 2015). We \n\nconclude that, while the results are consistent with local genetic adaptation, this hypothesis \n\nwill require further analysis and confirmation via the transcriptomes extracted from the \n\nindividuals across the experiments, particularly those derived from the F1 generation cultured \n\nin vitro from parental reproductive material.  \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\nIndividuals from the North-Center (NC) region showed a consistently poor photosynthetic \n\nresponse to thermal and nutrients stressors compared with other regions using both \n\nacclimated field-collected blades (Experiment 1) and in vitro F1 sporophytes (Experiment \n\n3). As F1 juveniles were grown in common-garden laboratory conditions, the effects of \n\nenvironmental history can safely be excluded (assuming no or limited carry-over across \n\ngenerations and life-history phases). It can therefore be concluded that the NC populations \n\nare intrinsically less able to cope with stress conditions due to genetic factors. A possible \n\nreason might be elevated levels of self-fertilization and inbreeding in NC populations. \n\nPrevious studies in the Santa Barbara bay area showed that self-fertilization greatly reduced \n\nM. pyrifera fitness (survival to adulthood, zygote production, development of reproductive \n\nstructures and fecundity) (Raimondi et al., 2004) . The study of Johansson et al., (2013) \n\nreported a high self-fertilization rate (32-44%) and strong correlation between inbreeding \n\ndepression and mortality. Although this hypothesis requires an objective study and analysis \n\nat the regional level, our results suggest that reproductive strategies and constraints such as \n\ninbreeding and self-fertilization may be important factors regulating regional differences \n\nunderlying local population dynamics. \n\nThe North (N) and South-Center (SC) regions adult blades showed similar intermediate \n\nphotosynthetic responses to stress conditions with no significant differences between them \n\n(Table 1, Fig. 3). N region blades from both depths were in very good conditions, with almost \n\nno tissue damage or mucilage production and good pigmentation which might reflect local \n\nfield conditions prior to our experiment as SW temperatures were below 15\u00baC in the area. \n\nThe good ecophysiological conditions might have contributed to the increase of \n\nphotosynthetic efficiency of surface blades (?) compared to the other regions but Fv/Fm and \n\nETRmax were lower than the S region, suggesting greater stress on the photosynthetic \n\napparatus. The N region kelp forests are located ~ 300 km north of the phylogeographical \n\nbreak of Point Sal (Johansson et al., 2015), 50Km north of the biogeographic break of Point \n\nConception, a boundary characterized by a 5\u00baC north-south temperature gradient caused by \n\nthe interaction of the cold California current with the California Eddy (Burton, 1998; Eberl \n\net al., 2013). The mean surface temperature during a MHW over the last 22 years is 15.447\u00baC \n\n\u00b1 0.958 in this region. This suggests that these populations are not exposed to the same level \n\nof thermal/nutrient stress experienced by the southern regions, and may putatively be less \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nable to cope with such stresses. Our regional analysis did not, however, show a clear \n\nlatitudinal gradient of ecophysiological response of the giant kelp to thermal and nutrient \n\nstresses, which could be due to several factors:  heterogeneity of oceanographic/atmospheric \n\nprocesses (Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a, California current, \n\nCalifornia Eddy, upwelling areas, internal waves) (Burton, 1998; Fram et al., 2008; Ladah et \n\nal., 2012 ; Newman et al., 2016; Jacox et al., 2016)   , or, as suggested by other authors, or \n\nby more local processes that interact at a smaller (population) scales such as competition, \n\ndispersal and reproduction, wave exposure, dispersal, forest depth and density (Dayton, \n\n1999; Edwards, 2004; Edwards &amp; Hern\u00e1ndez-Carmona, 2005; Cavanaugh et al., 2011; \n\nCavanaugh et al., 2013; Johansson et al., 2015). Thus, in order to understand and predict \n\npossible implications of climate change on M. pyrifera forests on a regional level, further \n\nstudies should focus on understanding the fundamental processes that act locally and how \n\nthey interact with larger scale processes. \n\n \n\nThermal limits \n\nThis study showed that at 24\u00baC adult blades from almost all regions of Macrocystis pyrifera \n\nstudied showed a strong decline in ecophysiological responses. However, the exception was \n\nsurface blades from the southernmost region, which did not follow general trends with \n\nrespect to temperature-sensitive photosynthetic parameters Ek and rETRmax. While Fv/Fm and \n\nthe slope of electron transport rate with increasing irradiance (?) showed a similar pattern of \n\nphotosynthetic rate decrease with increasing temperature, rETRmax and Ek increased from 15 \n\nto 20 \u00baC followed by a decrease at 24 \u00baC. This temperature trend is typical of rate-limited \n\nenzymatic processes in, e.g., Calvin cycle enzymes such as RuBisCO (Kirk, 2011). When \n\ntemperature was increased to 24\u00baC the thermal optimum for photosynthesis was exceeded \n\nand the entire network was affected. The exception to this pattern was the S region surface \n\nblades in which ETRmax an Ek did not differ between 15 and 24\u00baC, suggesting either pre-\n\nacclimation or adaptation to local conditions with warmer SW temperatures. \n\n It appears that the thermal limits of photosynthetic performance were not exceeded in \n\nExperiment 3 using F1 juvenile sporophytes, in which 21\u00baC was the maximum exposure \n\ntemperature. It is also possible that the use of gradual thermal ramping may have alleviated \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\nthe effects of thermal stress in this experiment (2\u00baC increments per 24 h up to the target \n\ntemperature), compared with the direct shock used in the 1st and 2nd experiments. As a result, \n\nF1 sporophytes showed increasing ETRmax and Ek with increasing temperature, particularly \n\nin the SC and S regions. We decided on this approach based on the results and observations \n\nof the last two experiments, as well as published experiments showing that juveniles under \n\nstress conditions survive less well than adults (Dean &amp; Jacobsen, 1984), the small size and \n\nthickness of the F1 sporophytes and the necessity to avoid sampling necrotic tissue that would \n\njeopardize further transcriptomic analysis. Although F1 sporophytes were not subjected to \n\nsubstantial disturbance to the photosynthetic apparatus, e.g., decline in Fv/Fm at higher \n\ntemperatures, it was nevertheless significant that differences in thermally-sensitive \n\nenzymatic processes (Ek and rETRmax) could be distinguished between S/SC (higher \n\nperformance) and N/NC (lower performance) regions. However, further experiments will be \n\nrequired to explore the effects of higher temperatures on the upper thermal limits for \n\nphotosynthetic performance and other (e.g., growth) responses.  \n\nClimatology data for the months prior to our sampling showed that the central regions (NC \n\nand SC) shared similar thermal regimes, while the N region dominated by the cold California \n\ncurrent had lower temperatures and S region was already experiencing high SW temperatures \n\n(Fig. 4). The low canopy cover of the southernmost populations may have reflected the \n\nprevailing thermal conditions, in addition to which local populations composed of juveniles \n\nand small adult sporophytes were still regrowing after they disappeared during the summer \n\nof 2014 (personal communication by the local fisherman). This information is supported by \n\nthe 22 y climatology data of the S region (Fig. 5) which showed a great increase in MHW \n\nfrequency in the summer of 2014 and spring of 2015. Selection pressure for \n\nacclimation/survival of individuals more adapted to higher temperatures prior to sampling is \n\ntherefore clearly possible. Our data also showed an unprecedented increase frequency, \n\nduration and intensity of MHWs that for the first time in 22 years occurred for two \n\nconsecutive years (2014-15) (see also Table 2); phenomena reported on the study area by \n\nseveral other authors (Bond et al., 2015 ; Jacox et al., 2016; Levine &amp; Mcphaden, 2016; Reed \n\net al., 2016; Cohen et al., 2017). While temperature itself can directly impact the vital \n\nprocesses of the giant kelp, including photosynthesis, SW temperature increase is inversely \n\nrelated to nutrients concentration and indeed has been widely used as a proxy for nutrient \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nconcentration (Kamykowsk, 1977; Dugdale et al., 1989; Zimmerman &amp; Kremer, 1984; \n\nSwitzer et al., 2003; Reed et al., 2016). \n\n \n\nNutrient effects \n\nThe nutrient treatments tested in Experiment 1 (enriched and non-enriched SW with PES) \n\ndid not showed clear effects on the photosynthesis rates of the adult blades. This lack of effect \n\nwas evident as the RLCs parameters and Fv/Fm showed no significance on the Nutrients and \n\nno interaction was found with the other factors (Table 1). A likely reason is that even though \n\nM. pyrifera adult sporophyte nutrient and photosynthate storage capabilities are considered \n\nto be small (only 2-3 weeks) (Gerard, 1982) the short duration of the experiment (max. 72 h) \n\ndid not result in significant depletion of reserves. Another reason might be that the nutrient \n\nconcentration on the SW used on our experiment was already above non-limiting \n\nconcentrations, even though it was collected from stationary reservoirs where the SW is \n\nstored for several days at relatively high temperatures. The analysis of the water sampled \n\nduring the experiment 1 from each treatment was not available by the writing of this thesis \n\nbut will certainly be used to clarify our results in future publications. On the other hand, \n\nsignificant nutrients effects and interaction with temperature were observed in experiment 2 \n\n(Table 3). Our results showed that at higher temperatures (i.e. 24\u00baC) photosynthetic rates \n\n(Fv/Fm) were significantly lower in the non-enriched treatments compared to the PES-\n\nenriched treatments, although no significant differences were found at 16\u00baC control. This \n\nillustrates a positive relationship between nutrient availability and thermal stress tolerance to \n\nwarmer temperatures. Our results are in agreement with a recent study on another Kelp, \n\nSaccharina japonica, where nutrient availability significantly increased growth rates and \n\nsurvival of juveniles and adults (blade discs) at warmer temperatures (Gao et al., 2017). In \n\ntwo separate field experiments using nutrient fertilization, M. pyrifera  responded positively \n\nto thermal stress (warm seawater periods) when nutrient availability was increased, resulting \n\nin reduction of adult canopy loss (North, 1983) and increase of juvenile survival (Hernandez-\n\nCarmona et al., 2001). Thus our further research will also include a non-enriched treatment \n\n(using controlled artificial SW) in order to understand the possible synergistic effect of \n\nnutrients at warm SW temperature on the F1 juvenile sporophytes.  \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\nDepth effects \n\nConsistent differences in the photosynthetic rates between surface and bottom blades were \n\nfound, with surface blades showing a lower mean Fv/Fm and RLC parameters (?, rETRmax \n\nand Ek) but also higher variance within these values, especially at 24 \u00baC. Previous studies \n\nhave found that the maximum photosynthetic and ETR rates of M. pyrifera blades decreased \n\nwith depth and were mainly controlled by the vertical distribution of PAR in the water \n\ncolumn (Colombo-Pallotta et al., 2006). In that study, surface blades were found to be \n\nadapted for high photosynthetic production with high values of Fv/Fm and rETR and protected \n\nfrom the high light intensity by UV-absorbing compounds and protective carotenoids while \n\nbottom blades had lower photosynthetic rates and were responsible for the nutrient uptake. \n\nThis makes sense as an adaptation to the local environmental conditions in the Baja \n\nCalifornia warmer months: a stratified water column with an oligotrophic warm surface layer \n\nthat is breached by deep cold, nutrient rich waters pulsed by upwelling and internal waves \n\nevents (Ladah, 2003; Ladah et al., 2012; Rodriguez et al., 2016). In another study, old surface \n\nblades were found to have lower Fv/Fm values and higher variability compared to bottom \n\nblades but also strong diurnal variability photosynthetic performance (Edwards &amp; Kim, \n\n2010). During our experiment, surface blades from all regions also showed lower Fv/Fm \n\nvalues, lower pigmentation and were visibly more damaged than bottom blades. It is then \n\nsafe to assume that the continuous exposure to UV, wave motion, higher temperatures and \n\nphotosynthesis workload on surface blades resulted in higher cellular and external damage. \n\nThe exposure to the experimental temperatures (24 \u00baC) above the algae thermal optimum \n\nresulted in more rapid degradation of the surface blades. On the other hand bottom blades \n\nwere in much better physiological condition and showed higher stability between regions for \n\nall RLCs parameters compared to the surface blades, a pattern also reported previously for \n\nM. pyrifera (Edwards &amp; Kim, 2010).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\nConclusions  \n\nOur findings suggests that populations of M. pyrifera from the southernmost region of the \n\nspecies distribution in the northern hemisphere, exhibit resilience to warmer ocean conditions \n\ncompared to cooler, more northern regions. At the southern limit, higher photosynthetic rates \n\nunder thermal stress were observed in field sampled adult blades acclimated and tested under \n\ncommon garden conditions.  Importantly, with respect to mainly enzyme-limited \n\nphotosynthetic processes (rETRmax, Ek), greater tolerance was seen in vitro F1 juveniles from \n\nthe S and SC regions, suggesting that populations in these regions are locally adapted to the \n\nprevailing warmer ocean conditions. Despite the greater resilience to thermal stress, observed \n\nincreasing frequency and intensity of MHWs and other disturbances such as hurricanes might \n\nresult in a cumulative effect on the M. pyrifera forests, reducing the overall resilience of the \n\necosystem (Wernberg et al., 2010).  \n\nWe also observed a generally poor photosynthetic response to thermal stress in the NC \n\nregion, which also carried over to the F1 generation. Climatological data showed a thermal \n\nregime in the NC region around Santa Barbara to be at least as warm as the SC area of Baja \n\nCalifornia. Therefore our experimental observations suggest some underlying genetic basis \n\nleading to reduced fitness (e.g., possible inbreeding; Raimondi et al., 2004) in this region, \n\nwhich forms a distinct genetic group (Johansson et al., 2015).  \n\nOur experiments also demonstrated that thermal stress tolerance of M. pyrifera might be \n\nenhanced by nutrient availability and highlights the need for future studies on this subject. \n\nFinally, the use of excised blades as a valid surrogate for entire individuals was verified for \n\nM. pyrifera juveniles, at least for short experimental periods (24-72h). Our further research \n\nwill focus the analysis of the transcriptomes extracted from the adult blades and F1 juveniles \n\nin order to evaluate putative regional local adaptation and assess the synergy of nutrients and \n\ntemperature stress on F1 sporophytes. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nReferences \n\nAdey, W.
