Cork-Polymer Composites (CPC) is one of the most \n\npromising fields in cork technology to produce new materials based on sustainable development. Cork \n\ncombined with polymer matrices, has the prospective of lead to composite materials with better \n\nproperties. In this context, new fields of application where cork cannot compete alone might be \n\nreached.  \n\nThe present thesis focuses on the investigation of engineering properties of the thermoplastic matrices, \n\nsuch as High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and Polypropylene (PP), combined with cork trough melt \n\nbased technologies, by taking advantage of their intrinsic properties to create cork-based composites. \n\nTowards to reach more bio-based composite materials, cork was combined with biodegradable aliphatic \n\npolyesters mainly, PolyhydroxyButyrate-co-HydroxyValerate (PHBV); Poly(L-Lactic Acid) (PLLA); Poly-?-\n\nCaproLactone (PCL) and Starch-Poly-?-CaproLactone (SPCL).  \n\nCork and its by-products obtained from finishing industrial operations and end-of-life products were \n\ncompounded, promoting added-value to cork based composites. The process methods used to create \n\nCPC were either pultrusion or twin-screw extrusion processes. Whereas, compression moulding and \n\ninjection moulding were used to obtain the final composite product. During this process, the \n\ncompatibility and adhesion between the polar cork and the non-polar polymer is one of the key \n\nchallenges. Reinforcement strategies show that the lignocellulosic\u2013matrix compatibility was improved by \n\n(i) via the structure of matrix, by employing coupling agents (CA) based on maleic anhydride, (ii) the use \n\nof natural fibre, or by modifying the fibre surface (i.e. hybrid composites). Indeed, all of them lead to \n\ncork based composites with considerably better mechanical properties. In addition, the interfacial \n\nadhesion of cork-polymer was also improved either using suberin or lignin isolated from cork by-\n\nproducts as bio-based coupling agents with significant benefits for the environment.  \n\nThe findings presented in this thesis show that the general properties of CPC materials reveals the \n\nrequired: (i) dimension stability with reduced water absorption, (ii) homogeneous distribution and \n\ndispersion of the cork particles in the polymer matrix, (iii) improved fire resistance to the matix, good \n\nthermal and acoustic insulation properties and (iv) an interesting range of mechanical properties. As for \n\nas bio-based composite materials, it was engineering a class of cork biocomposites more sustainable \n\nwith acceptable in-service performance and tendency for rapid out-of-service biodegradation.  \n\n\n\nNew Functionalization / Reinforcement Strategies for Cork Plastics Composites: Opening a wide Range \n\nof Innovative Applications for Cork based Products \n\n \n\nvi \n\nLignocellulosic materials such as natural fibres and cork also offer economic and environmental \n\nadvantages over traditional inorganic reinforcements and fillers. The work described in this thesis brings \n\nnew knowledge and contribute to a deeper understanding in the promising cork-polymer composites \n\n(CPC) materials field. Overall, the findings presented in this thesis make a significant contribution to \n\nbetter understand the CPC materials. Therefore, the combination of cork with polymeric matrices \n\nreveals to be a significant added-value to cork based materials, with high potential for a wide range of \n\ninnovative applications. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nNew Functionalization / Reinforcement Strategies for Cork Plastics Composites: Opening a wide Range \n\nof Innovative Applications for Cork based Products \n\n \n\nvii \n\nResumo \n\nAvan\u00e7os em comp\u00f3sitos de base florestal, mostram uma tend\u00eancia de crescimento no uso de materiais \n\nlenhoccelul\u00f3sicos como carga e/ou refor\u00e7o em comp\u00f3sitos de pl\u00e1stico. O campo dos materiais \n\ncomp\u00f3sitos corti\u00e7a-pol\u00edmero (CPC) \u00e9 dos mais promissores da tecnologia corti\u00e7a para produzir novos \n\nmateriais com base no desenvolvimento sustent\u00e1vel. A corti\u00e7a combinada com matrizes polim\u00e9ricas, \n\napresenta o potencial de obter materiais comp\u00f3sitos com melhores propriedades. Neste contexto, \n\nnovos campos de aplica\u00e7\u00e3o onde a corti\u00e7a n\u00e3o pode competir por si s\u00f3 podem ser alcan\u00e7ados. \n\nA presente tese centra-se na investiga\u00e7\u00e3o das propriedades de engenharia das matrizes termopl\u00e1sticas, \n\ncomo o polietileno de alta densidade (HDPE) e o polipropileno (PP), combinadas com a corti\u00e7a atrav\u00e9s \n\nde tecnologias baseadas na fus\u00e3o, tirando proveito de suas propriedades intr\u00ednsecas, para criar \n\ncomp\u00f3sitos \u00e0 base de corti\u00e7a. No sentido de obter materiais comp\u00f3sitos de origem natural, a corti\u00e7a foi \n\ncombinada com poli\u00e9steres alif\u00e1ticos biodegrad\u00e1veis principalmente, polihidroxibutirato-co-\n\nhidroxivalerato (PHBV), Poli(L-\u00e1cido l\u00e1ctico) (PLLA), poli-?-caprolactona (PCL) e Amido poli-?-\n\ncaprolactona (SPCL). \n\nA corti\u00e7a e os seus sub-produtos obtidos a partir de opera\u00e7\u00f5es de acabamento industriais e produtos \n\nem fim de vida foram misturados, com o intuito de potenciar valor acrescentado aos diferentes \n\ncomp\u00f3sitos com corti\u00e7a. Os m\u00e9todos de processamento usados para criar CPC s\u00e3o processos de \n\nextrus\u00e3o de duplo-fuso ou pultrus\u00e3o. Tendo em considera\u00e7\u00e3o que a molda\u00e7\u00e3o por compress\u00e3o e \n\nmolda\u00e7\u00e3o por injec\u00e7\u00e3o foram usadas para obter o produto comp\u00f3sito final. Durante este processo, o \n\ngrau de compatibilidade e de ades\u00e3o entre a corti\u00e7a polar e o pol\u00edmero n\u00e3o-polar \u00e9 um dos principais \n\ndesafios. Estrat\u00e9gias de refor\u00e7o mostram que o grau de compatibilidade lenhocelul\u00f3sico-matriz foi \n\nmelhorado (i) atrav\u00e9s da estrutura de matriz, pelo emprego de agentes compatibilizandores (CA) com \n\nbase no anidrido maleico, (ii) pela utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de fibras naturais, ou modificando a superf\u00edcie da fibra \n\n(isto \u00e9, comp\u00f3sitos h\u00edbridos). Na verdade, todos eles levam a comp\u00f3sitos de corti\u00e7a com \n\nconsideravelmente melhores propriedades mec\u00e2nicas. Al\u00e9m disso, a ades\u00e3o interfacial da corti\u00e7a-\n\npol\u00edmero tamb\u00e9m foi melhorada quer utilizando suberina ou lenhina isolada a partir de sub-produtos da \n\ncorti\u00e7a como agentes compatibilizantes de base florestal, com vantagens significativas para o ambiente. \n\nOs resultados apresentados nesta tese mostram que as propriedades gerais dos materiais CPC \n\nrevelam a necess\u00e1ria: (i) a estabilidade dimensional com reduzida absor\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua, (ii) distribui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nhomog\u00e9nea e dispers\u00e3o das part\u00edculas de corti\u00e7a na matriz polim\u00e9rica, (iii) melhorada resist\u00eancia ao \n\n\n\nNew Functionalization / Reinforcement Strategies for Cork Plastics Composites: Opening a wide Range \n\nof Innovative Applications for Cork based Products \n\n \n\nviii \n\nfogo da matriz, boas propriedades de isolamento t\u00e9rmico e ac\u00fastico e (iv) e um conjunto interessante \n\nde propriedades mec\u00e2nicas. Quanto aos materiais comp\u00f3sitos com bio-poliesters, foi desenvolvida uma \n\nclasse de engenharia de biocomp\u00f3sitos de corti\u00e7a mais sustent\u00e1veis, com desempenho aceit\u00e1vel em \n\nservi\u00e7o e tend\u00eancia de r\u00e1pida biodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o fora-de-servi\u00e7o. \n\nMateriais lenhocelul\u00f3sicos, como as fibras naturais e a corti\u00e7a tamb\u00e9m oferecem vantagens \n\necon\u00f3micas e ambientais sobre os materiais de refor\u00e7o ou de cargas inorg\u00e2nicas tradicionais. O \n\ntrabalho descrito nesta tese traz novos conhecimentos e contribui para uma compreens\u00e3o mais \n\nprofunda no campo dos promissores materiais comp\u00f3sitos de corti\u00e7a -pol\u00edmero (CPC). No geral, os \n\nresultados apresentados nesta tese contribuiem significativamente para uma melhor compreen\u00e7\u00e3o dos \n\nmateriais CPC. Portanto, a combina\u00e7\u00e3o de corti\u00e7a com matrizes polim\u00e9ricas revela ser uma mais-valia \n\nsignificativa para materiais com base na corti\u00e7a, com alto potencial para uma ampla gama de \n\naplica\u00e7\u00f5es inovadoras. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nNew Functionalization / Reinforcement Strategies for Cork Plastics Composites: Opening a wide Range \n\nof Innovative Applications for Cork based Products \n\n \n\nix \n\nTable of Contents \n\nAcknowledgements iii \n\nAbstract v \n\nResumo vii \n\nTable of Contents ix \n\nList of Symbols and Abbreviations xxi \n\nList of Figures xxv \n\nList of Tables xxxv \n\nList of Publications xxxix \n\nIntroduction to the thesis format xliii \n\n \n\nSECTION I \n\nChapter 1.

The high potential of the cork-polymer \n\ncomposites (CPC) to obtain sustainable materials; the complexity to compound high volumes of cork \n\nthrough melt based technologies; the reinforcement strategies using hybrid systems (i.e. based on cork \n\nand natural fibres) to improve the mechanical response and the improvement of cork-polymer adhesion, \n\nwere the key issues considered in this work to potentiate a wide range of innovative applications for \n\ncork based products. The thesis is sub-divided in 10 chapters, being 7 of them experimental work and 1 \n\nliterature review that is based on peer-reviewed papers published / submitted for publication. All papers \n\nare identified in the front page of each chapter. In this sense, each thesis chapter is the published, \n\nsubmitted or an adapted version of these, in order to maintain the global structure of the work. Finally, \n\nand in appendix format, are provided 2 international patents developed during this thesis \n\ncomplementing in more detail some parts of the work. Figure A shows the structure of the thesis \n\ndivided in the 4 main sections. The contents of each chapter are summarized below. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure A. Scheme representing the structure of the thesis. \n\n \n\nSECTION I (Chapter 1): The first section consists of a comprehensive and detailed literature review \n\nabout bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources and their potential uses particularly in the \n\n\n\nNew Functionalization / Reinforcement Strategies for Cork Plastics Composites: Opening a wide Range \n\nof Innovative Applications for Cork based Products \n\n \n\nxliv \n\nbiomedical field. The review highlights the potential of different lignocellulosic components as \n\nreinforcement at the nanometer level in different structures. This review combined with the \n\nintroductions presented in the section III (i.e. chapter 3 up to chapter 9) aims to give a higher \n\nconsciousness, the recent developments and potentialities of this technological area, where the main \n\nissue is the lack of knowledge on cork-polymer composites (CPC) through melt based technologies. \n\n \n\nSECTION II (Chapter 2): The second section describes in detail the materials used, the processing \n\ntechniques employed to develop the different CPC and the characterization techniques used to evaluate \n\nand understand the characteristics of the developed CPC. The objective was to complement the \n\nprovided information in each of the following experimental chapters. \n\n \n\nSECTION III (Chapter 3 to 9): The third section includes 7 chapters, corresponding to the results and \n\ndiscussion sections of 7 research papers. As previously pointed, the introduction of each chapter \n\nintends to support the reader on the subject, providing information of the state-of-art on the area and \n\nthe central motivations of the work.  \n\n \n\nChapter 3 and Chapter 4, are devoted to the development of cork based polyolefin composite pellets by \n\npulltrusion process followed by compression moulding. In both chapters, high consumption \n\nthermoplastic materials (i.e. polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE)) were tested to obtain cork-based \n\ncomposites (50-50) wt.% with a competitive cost. Moreover and accounting with the polar behaviour of \n\ncork and the non-polar behaviour of the polyolefin, a small amount of coupling agent (2 wt.%) based on \n\nmaleic anhydride (i.e. PE-g-MA or PP-g-MA) was used to improve the adhesion. \n\n \n\nChapter 3 focuses on the potential of different cork by-products from the industrial process, creating \n\nadded value to cork and a profitable alternative to storage or burn of cork powder to generate energy in \n\nindustrial process. \n\n \n\nChapter 4 describes a comparative study between a selected cork-polymer composition previously \n\ndeveloped in Chapter 3, with the well-established commercial products, namely high-density fibreboard \n\n(HDF) and medium density fibreboard (MDF) products.

Thus, \n\na different technology to compound the CPC pellets was evaluated. The addition of polypropylene-graft-\n\nmaleic anhydride (PP-g-MA) and stearic acid were also tested as coupling agents. The influence of cork \n\non the melt viscosity, on morphological particle distribution, physical and thermal properties is \n\ndescribed. The mechanical response before and after water immersion tests was also analysed to \n\nevaluate the potential of application. Moreover, the maximum incorporation of cork in the composite \n\nwas also accessed. \n\n \n\nBeing the compatibility between cork-polyolefin one of the key issues, Chapter 6 proposes the use of \n\nsuberin and lignin isolated from cork powder as bio-based coupling agents through a reactive extrusion \n\nprocess, in order to overcome the insufficient adhesion between cork and a polyethylene matrix with \n\nenvironmental benefits. To evaluate their potential as an adhesion promoter, the properties of the new \n\nfunctionalized composites are compared with those of an equivalent system using a coupling agent PE-\n\ng-MA. \n\n \n\nChapter 7 and Chapter 8 were devoted to reinforcement strategies using short natural fibres to improve \n\nthe mechanical response of the cork based composites. It was developed and tested hybrid CPC \n\nsystems using counter-rotating twin-screw extrusion followed by compression moulding, maintaining a \n\nhigh cork content. Special emphasis was given in both chapters to obtaining higher mechanical \n\nproperties by increasing the amount of the natural component in the final composite. In addition, the \n\nneed of low amount of coupling agent based on maleic anhydride (2 wt.%) was tested. In Chapter 7 \n\ncork powder-polymer composites (50-50) wt.% reinforced with coconut fibre were evaluated.  \n\n \n\nFollowing a similar strategy, in Chapter 8, it was selected a fibre with higher mechanical performance to \n\nreinforce the developed composites.  In this chapter, we investigated the use of short sisal fibres, with \n\nand without alkali treatment as a strategy to reinforce cork granules-polymer (40-60) wt.% composite \n\n\n\nNew Functionalization / Reinforcement Strategies for Cork Plastics Composites: Opening a wide Range \n\nof Innovative Applications for Cork based Products \n\n \n\nxlvi \n\nmaterials.

Chapter 9 addresses the preparation of biocomposites combining \n\ndifferent biodegradable aliphatic polyesters with granulated cork 30 wt.%. Cork was compounded with \n\npoly(L-lactic acid), (PLLA); polyhydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate, (PHBV); poly-?-caprolactone (PCL) \n\nand starch-poly-?-caprolactone (SPCL) using co-rotating twin-screw extruder followed by injection \n\nmoulding. The contribution of cork to the composite density and mechanical performance was \n\nevaluated. Biodegradation of these cork biocomposites under water and soil conditions accessed by \n\nmeans of morphology and by the physico-mechanical behaviour was described. \n\n \n\nSECTION IV (Chapter 10): This thesis ends with Chapter 10, which consists on the summary and the \n\noverall conclusions of the research work developed under the scope of this thesis with some \n\nrecommendations and future perspectives on the cork-polymer composites (CPC) area.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSECTION I \u2013 GENERAL INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nChapter 1.

Human and plant tissues, such as, wood, bone and cartilage are structured at the \n\nnanometer level and exhibit a hierarchical structure up to the macroscale. Their morphological \n\nsimilarities enable the exploitation of lignocellulosic materials in the development of nanostructured \n\ncomposites targeting tissue engineering and regeneration. In this review, lignocellulosic materials and \n\ntheir chemical constituents are highlighted as promising alternatives for the development of drug-\n\ndelivery vehicles and for the engineering or regeneration of bone and cartilage. Special focus is given to \n\nthe recent developments of lignocellulosic bionanocomposite supports that induce cell attachment and \n\nproliferation. Chemical modifications techniques as well as composite processing methodologies that \n\nenhance the biomaterial performance are reviewed. It is anticipated the increasing interest in \n\nnanocellulose, bacterial cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin from natural resources as added-value \n\nbiomedical materials in the near future. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1\n This chapter is based on the following publication: \n\nFernandes EM, Pires RA, Mano JF and Reis RL, 2013, Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, \n\napplications and future trends for their use in the biomedical field, Progress in Polymer Science, 38 (10-11): 1415-1441. \n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n5 \n\n1.1 Introduction \n\nThe Bionanocomposites are usually defined as a combination of two or more materials or phases in \n\nwhich one of the phases has at least one dimension in the nanometer range (1\u2013100 nm) [1-4]. The \n\nterminology usually refers to a matrix for the more concentrated component that enables a phase \n\ncontinuum, while reinforcements are components that induce an enhanced performance (e.g. \n\nmechanical, thermal, etc.) from the composite. Matrices may be biodegradable polymers (e.g. chemical \n\nmodified cellulose systems), ideally derived from renewable resources (e.g. plants). In terms of \n\nreinforcements, they might include plant fibers and by-products from lignocellulosic renewable \n\nresources or synthetic inorganic materials, as well as natural or modified clays. Plant-based \n\nnanocellulose and bacterial cellulose [5] are included in this definition. Moreover, blended polymers \n\nthat act as matrices in a composite perspective are also included. The reviewed constructs target the \n\ndevelopment of biocompatible medical devices, or biodegradable materials under a complete tissue \n\nregeneration approach. The interest in lignocellulosic polymers, in particular the cellulose-based ones, is \n\ndue to their reinforcement capacity and biodegradability. Moreover, cellulose-based materials have \n\nproven to present excellent biocompatibility [6, 7]. Being the term biocompatibility defined as the ability \n\nof a material to perform with an appropriated host response in a specific biomedical application [8].This \n\nset of characteristics are the most relevant to consider these materials as good candidates for tissue \n\nengineering and regenerative medicine (TERM) applications, both as scaffolds or as drug-delivery carrier \n\nsystems. Nanotechnology can be applied across different application areas, allowing the development of \n\nthe so called enabling science. The ability to control the material features at the nanoscale and the \n\nevaluation of their influence in the micro and macroscopic properties provides the opportunity to \n\ndevelop new bionanocomposite systems in a previously unimaginable dimension. Bionanocomposites \n\nare attractive materials for biomedical applications due to the matching of the length scales of: their \n\nstructure and the components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Under these conditions, the \n\ndevelopment of nanostructured biomaterials for medical applications implies a multidisciplinary \n\nresearch approach that combines engineering, chemistry, physics, biology and life sciences. \n\nIn this review we have compiled the research executed with lignocellulosic materials in the biomedical \n\nfield, with particular emphasis on drug-delivery systems and scaffolds relevant in the scope of TERM. \n\nThe main focus will be on the development of bionanocomposite structures formulated with \n\nlignocellulosic components within the previously described fields of application. Nanostructured \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n6 \n\npyrolyzed lignocellulosic structures will be also discussed as carbon templates for scaffold development. \n\nThe addition of plant-based and bacterial-based cellulose (BC) to enhance thermal and mechanical \n\nproperties, as well as the biodegradability of biomaterials is also analyzed. The use of cellulose, \n\nhemicellulose and lignin as components of bionanocomposite systems are described, with special focus \n\non micro and nano-sized reinforcements. It is also highlighted the use of chemical modified \n\nlignocellulosic materials, focusing on the advantages of these modifications in order to promote \n\nbiocompatibility. Moreover it is compiled the available processing methodologies and their impact in the \n\nproperties of the bionanocomposites.  \n\nThis review intends to show that biomaterials from lignocellulosic sources have potential to play an \n\nimportant role in human health. An overview of the current and potential applications of lignocellulosic-\n\nbased bionanocomposites is performed and includes the research relevant mainly for bone and \n\ncartilage engineering and regeneration; although, their application as drug-delivery carriers and wound \n\ndressing systems are also described. Complementary information can be found in literature reviews that \n\nfocus on the potential of cellulose-based nanocomposites in different areas such as: food packaging \n\nmaterials and films [2, 9, 10]; printing and paper industry [2, 3, 11]; optical, light-responsive \n\ncomposites and other electronic devices [3, 9, 12-14]; advanced composites manufacturing [10, 12]; \n\npharmaceutical and medical applications [3, 5, 13]. Additionally it is also possible to find reviews on the \n\nproperties and potential of cellulose nanofibers and its composites [10, 15]; on BC-based materials [11, \n\n16-18], and methodologies to control their physical and chemical structure targeting their application as \n\nscaffolds and wound healing systems, as well as, within the scope of tissue engineering (TE) [19, 20]; \n\nand lignocellulosic-based hydrogels, including biodegradation of some cellulose derivatives [21-23]. \n\n1.2 Bone and cartilage tissue regeneration \n\n1.2.1 Materials properties \n\nThe selection of biomaterials is particularly relevant within most of the TE strategies. Its main function is \n\nto act as a support for the colonization by cells in the intervened area, promoting the formation of new \n\ntissue.  In this perspective, the biomaterial should present a set of adequate mechanical, thermal, \n\nmorphological, chemical and biological characteristics [24-26]. \n\nIn a mechanical point of view the support biomaterial should withstand the mechanical stresses within \n\nthe tissue to be repaired. Most of the biomaterials (e.g. metals, high performance polymers, etc.) used \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n7 \n\nto substitute the bone/cartilage possess a higher stiffness than the tissue to be intervened. This usually \n\nimposes additional stresses to the surrounding biological tissue enhancing the probability of its \n\nmechanical failure [27]. There is thus the need for the development of materials that present \n\nmechanical performance similar to the tissue to be repaired enabling a better mechanical integration of \n\nthe constructs in the biological tissue. The mechanical properties of different biological tissues are \n\nsummarized in Table 1.1, including examples of references [28-33]. \n\n \n\nTable 1.1.

Although, it is relevant to notice that, in vivo, the performance of the biomaterial-based \n\nstructure is not only derived from the mechanical resistance of the biomaterial itself, but from the \n\ncomplex mixture of biomaterial, ECM components (e.g. proteins) and cells [27]. \n\nIn TE, it is common the use of a regenerative approach that intends to promote the formation of new \n\ntissue while the original biomaterial is being degraded. In this strategy, it is common the use of porous \n\nscaffolds that allow cell colonization in the bulk of the constructs [24]. Porosity is mandatory not only to \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n8 \n\nallow the accessibility of cells to the bulk but also to allow the exchange of nutrients and oxygen that are \n\nvital for cell survival under in vivo conditions [24, 34, 35]. \n\nUnder this approach it is considered acceptable a lower mechanical performance than the original \n\ntissue, as long as, the scaffold itself will not be subject to loadings above is elastic regime. In fact, the \n\nmechanical performance of this type of scaffolds is significantly lower than the base biomaterial. It is \n\ncommon to occur a 10-fold reduction of different mechanical properties, e.g. modulus [36]. \n\nOther important factor in designing TE supports is its surface properties [37]. They are relevant to \n\ninduce cellular attachment, differentiation and proliferation. The first response of the biological medium \n\nwhen in contact with the TE constructs is to coat the biomaterial with a layer of proteins. The \n\ncomposition of this layer is strongly affected by the biomaterial surface chemistry and energy [38]. This \n\ninitial process is critical for the first steps of cell attachment. Although, it is often difficult to match the \n\ndifferent bulk properties of the selected scaffold biomaterials with a surface chemistry/energy optimized \n\nto promote cell attachment. \n\nIn order to achieve an appropriate surface chemistry/energy, surface modification techniques are often \n\nused to confer specific chemical groups that are known to promote cell attachment [39-41]. These can \n\nrange from chemical grafting, plasma modification, surface coating or patterning approaches [42-46]. \n\n1.2.2 Biological requirements \n\nDepending on the target tissue there are a number of biological requirements that the support structure \n\nand the biomaterial should present. In the case of bone, the most relevant are related with [47, 48]: \n\nbioactivity; osteoproduction, osteoconduction and osteoinduction; angiogenic potential; and capacity to \n\nminimize the foreign body response.  \n\nBioactivity is defined as the capacity of the biomaterial to form a biologically active apatite layer on its \n\nsurface [47, 49]. The formation of these types of layers occurs by a complex set of chemical steps that \n\npromote the surface immobilization of calcium and phosphate ions [48] and their subsequent \n\norganization into calcium phosphate phases. These phases are one of the responsible for a series of \n\nproperties that are relevant for bone TE, namely, bone-bonding properties of the implanted device. \n\nSupports/biomaterials can present different biological characteristics that define their classification in \n\nterms of bioactivity. Biomaterials that only possess osteoconduction (capacity to stimulate bone growth \n\nat the biomaterials\u2019 surface) are considered to be of class B. When a biomaterial possesses both \n\nosteoproduction (bone growth in the interior of the support) and osteoconduction it is said to present \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n9 \n\nclass A bioactivity [47]. An additional advantage is the promotion of not only the proliferation, but also \n\nthe differentiation of progenitor cells (osteoinduction) into osteoblasts [50]. This can be achieved with \n\nthe incorporation of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) into the biomaterials [51-53]. There are a \n\nseries of different BMPs that are relevant at different stages of bone/cartilage formation, healing and \n\nremodeling [54, 55]. As an example, BMP-2 appear to peak at one day after fracture; BMP-14 has a \n\nmaximum of activity at one week during cartilage formation; finally, BMP-3, -4, -7 and -8 are more \n\nrelevant between the second and third week of bone repair [55, 56]. These observations motivated the \n\ndevelopment of a series of strategies to achieve BMP controlled delivery from the support structures to \n\nthe biological medium, with a profile that match their biological relevance [55]. \n\nIn a bone TE perspective, a complete bone remodeling and growth is better achieved by biomaterials \n\nand supports that present the whole set of the discussed biological characteristics: bioactivity, \n\nosteoconduction, osteoproduction and osteoinduction. A highly relevant part of new bone formation in \n\nthe interior of the support is the existence of a vasculature that is able to transport nutrients essential to \n\ncellular development [57]. It is known that osteocytes (the most common type of cells present in bone) \n\npossess intact capillaries at a distance lower than 100 \u00b5m. Additionally, the nutrient transport from the \n\nblood vessels to the cells is mainly governed by diffusion. As an example, theoretical modeling reveals \n\nthat non-vascularized support structures with 1 cm can hold 1000 times lesser cells than native \n\ncancelous bone [58]. In this perspective, it is clear that the importance of angiogenesis is increasing \n\nwith the dimension of the intervened area [35, 59]. Different strategies can be applied to increment \n\nangiogenesis, namely: the tuning of the construct geometry; the inclusion of angiogenic growth factors \n\n(e.g. VEGF, FGF); and the culturing of the structures in the presence of stem cells, endothelial cells, as \n\nwell as the use of co-culture systems [53, 60-65]. \n\nFinally, the implantation of a biomaterial in the biological tissue always generates an inflammatory \n\nresponse related with the surgical procedure. The use of degradable supports can also increase \n\ninflammation due to the degradation products that are leached from the biomaterial [66]. Initial foreign \n\nbody response can be minimized by surface modification of the biomaterials (e.g. surface chemistry, \n\ntopography, roughness) [67, 68] or the use of bioactive compounds (e.g. anti-inflammatory drugs, \n\ngrowth factors) in their formulation [69-71]. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n10 \n\n1.3 Sources of lignocellulosic materials \n\n1.3.1 Plant based \n\nThe use of cellular materials has the advantage of possessing good mechanical properties while \n\npresenting low density [72]. In nature, several materials present a cellular anisotropic structure, e.g. \n\nbone, wood, cork, among others; although, while bone is ceramic-polymer composite, wood is mostly a \n\npolymer-based composite.  \n\nWood is a natural composite material with a hierarchical architecture where biopolymers such as \n\ncellulose, hemicellulose and lignin form a highly porous anisotropic cellular microstructure, which \n\nexhibits unique combination of high strength, stiffness, toughness and low density [72, 73]. The \n\nchemical constituents of the wood cell wall, as well as other lignocellulosic-based materials are \n\npresented in Table 1.2, including their concentrations reported in the literature [73-80]. It\u2019s clear that \n\nthe concentration of each component can significantly differ depending on the plant species. In general, \n\nthe major organic constituents are [73, 74, 79, 81-83]: \n\n- Cellulose is the most abundant biopolymer and presents a long-chain polysaccharide structure \n\ncomposed by repeated units of d-glucose building blocks [81] see Figure 1.1. The polymeric chains are \n\npacked through hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces forming fibrous structures called microfibrils. \n\nAs a structural component in plants, cellulose is arranged as a system of fibrils embedded in a lignin \n\nmatrix. The microfibrils are a few nanometers of diameter presenting highly ordered regions (i.e. \n\ncrystalline phases) alternated with disordered domains (i.e. amorphous phases) [81, 84, 85]. A single \n\nfibril has a diameter of ca. 5 nm and a length up to tens of micrometers [81]. These fibrils are \n\ncomprised of different hierarchical microstructures commonly known as nano-sized microfibrils with \n\nhigh structural strength and stiffness, being the crystalline part named nanowhiskers [1], or \n\nnanocellulose crystals [10, 86]. Cellulose nanowhiskers are defined as elongated crystalline rod-like \n\nnanoparticles with a diameter ranging from 2 to 20 nm, typically obtained by acid hydrolysis of cellulose \n\nfibers [14, 15, 87]. The hydrolysis conditions and the type of acid affect the properties of the \n\nnanocrystals, such as a longer reaction time leads to shorter nanocrystals [88, 89]. Furthermore, the \n\nuse of sulfuric acid for the preparation of cellulose whiskers leads to more stable aqueous suspensions \n\nthan the ones prepared using hydrochloric acid [12, 89, 90]. It promotes a negatively charged surface \n\nresulting from the surface oxidation promoted by the sulfate ions, so that the cellulose suspension \n\nforms a stable colloidal system [89, 91]. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\nTable 1.2.

They are a group of branched polysaccharides (see Figure 1.1) \n\nthat are characterized by being neither cellulose nor pectin and by presenting ?-(1?4)-linked repeating \n\nunits of glucose, mannose or xylose [23, 83]. Cellulose and hemicelluloses contain free hydroxyl groups \n\nthat confer to the wood its inherent hygroscopic character [85]. Since hemicelluloses are responsible \n\nfor the interactions with water in wood, hydrogels using these materials have applications within \n\ndifferent fields [82, 93]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCellulose Hemicellulose \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1.

Lignin \n\nhas a phenolic-based chemical structure; its high carbon and low hydrogen content suggests that it has \n\na highly unsaturated and aromatic character. Lignin is characterized by its hydroxyl and methoxy groups \n\n[79] as it is represented in Figure 1.2. The chemical structure of lignin in natural fibers has not been \n\ncompletely established, although, most of its functional groups and units which make up the molecule \n\nhave been identified [73, 79]. More than its potential as biomaterial, lignin has demonstrated \n\nantioxidant capacity; strong antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency virus; and other anti-\n\nmicrobial activities [94, 95]. \n\n- Suberin, consists of a complex polyester structure composed by long chain fatty acids, hydroxy fatty \n\nand phenolic acids, linked by ester groups [73] present in the outer tissues of numerous vegetable \n\nspecies. It is mostly found in the cell walls of normal and wounded external tissues of aerial and/or \n\nsubterranean parts of plants.

The extraction of bark, in some cases, can be executed without harvesting the whole tree, \n\nmaintaining it alive. An example is the outer bark of Quercus suber, commonly known as cork. As wood, \n\ncork is a lignocellulosic material were suberin is the main chemical component, with concentrations \n\nbetween 30 and 50% [73]. Suberin is not present in the wood cell walls. This material presents a \n\nanisotropic closed cellular structure and a unique combination of properties, such as imperviousness to \n\nliquids, a high coefficient of friction, resilient, low density, viscoelastic, low thermal conductivity, fire \n\nresistance, high energy absorption and a near-zero Poisson coefficient [72, 73, 102]. The combination \n\nof these unique properties and the potential of the lignocellulosic chemical components has been issue \n\nof several studies for different purposes [74, 103-105]. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n15 \n\nMoreover, lignocellulosic materials from plant fibers such as bamboo, sisal, hemp, among others, also \n\npresent an anisotropic structure and they are a relevant source of cellulose and hemicellulose \n\nderivatives in the biomedical field. Just as an example it can be referred the use of bioactive ceramic \n\ncoatings on bamboo [106] generating a material that presents mechanical properties close to the \n\nmodulus of human long bone [107]. Bamboo has been tested for its in vitro cytotoxicity before and after \n\nheat or chemical treatments [107]. The results showed that ethanol, methanol and toluene can remove \n\ntoxic and some extend leachable components from bamboo. More recently, the preparation of cellulose \n\nnanofibers from bamboo with diameters of 30-80 nm was achieved by chemical pretreatment and \n\nultrasonication, followed by freeze-drying [84]. These nanofibers presented an organized structure \n\ncomposed by millions of parallel nanofibrils of 1-5 nm and several microns of length. The main \n\ncomposition of the produced nanofibers was based in cellulose due to the removal of non-cellulosic \n\npolysaccharides via conventional chemical treatment.  \n\nThe use of lignocellulosic structures and their components on the production of nanocomposites will \n\nopen new opportunities for biomedical applications. \n\n1.3.2 Bacterial cellulose \n\nBacterial Cellulose (BC) sometimes referred to as bacterial nanocellulose or microbial cellulose is a \n\nnatural polymer whose properties are similar to the hydrogels produced from synthetic polymers; for \n\nexample, it displays high water content (98-99%) and good sorption of liquids, it is non-allergenic, and \n\ncan be safely sterilized. BC is synthesized by the acetic bacterium Acetobacter xylinum (or \n\nGluconacetobacter xylinus), a gram-negative strain of acetic-acid-producing bacteria using a \n\nfermentation process [108, 109]. BC is a nanomaterial, having several characteristics that make it \n\nvaluable for biomedical applications such as: a highly pure and crystalline structure, high mechanical \n\nproperties, ultra-fine network, high hydrophilicity and biocompatibility and it has the advantage of in situ \n\nmouldability [81, 109-112]. The fibrous structure of BC consists of a 3D network of microfibrils \n\ncontaining glucan chains bounded together by hydrogen bonds. BC fibers of&lt;100 nm in diameter have \n\nhigh mechanical properties, e.g. tensile strength and modulus. BC microfibrils have a density of 1600 \n\nkg m-3, Young\u2019s modulus of 138 GPa, and tensile strength of at least 2 GPa, which are almost equal to \n\nthose of aramid fibers [113]. Its unique network structure is the main responsible for the previously \n\ndescribed characteristics. The potential applications of BC are quite vast; it can be used in the \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n16 \n\npreparation of materials targeting decellularised devices for wound healing or as scaffold for skin \n\nengineering after seeded with epithelial cells [19] or more recently in vascular grafts [114, 115]. \n\nIn an in vivo study of subcutaneous BC implantation in rats [116] it was found that after 12 weeks, no \n\nfibrotic capsule or giant cells was detectable by microscopy, indicating that no foreign body reaction \n\nwas occurring (see Figure 1.4). Furthermore, macroscopically, no redness, swelling, or exudate \n\ndeveloped around the implantation sites was observed showing the biocompatibility and the potential of \n\nthis nanomaterial. \n\n  \n\na) b) \n\nFigure 1.4.

[5, 16] evaluated the suitability of BC cylindrical conduits with \n\nan inner diameter of, approximately, 1 mm as artificial blood vessels. Bodin et al. [117] have also \n\nproposed BC as a potential meniscus implant being similar to human skin. BC can be produced in a \n\nmeniscus shape and, through the promotion of cell migration, makes it an attractive material as a \n\nmeniscus implant. BC can be also applied as skin substitute in treating extensive burns [118]. The \n\nnanostructured network and morphological similarities with collagen make BC very attractive for cell \n\nimmobilization, cell migration, and the production of ECMs [5]. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n17 \n\nAs reviewed by Klemm et al. [5, 81, 108], celluloses with different functionalities clearly open novel \n\nfields of application e.g., nanoporous hydrophilic membranes, nanoscaffold-based composite materials, \n\nand medical implants for repair of hard and soft tissue, as well as cardiovascular substitutes. \n\n1.4 Reinforced nanocomposite structures \n\n1.4.1 Cellulose-based materials \n\nTE represents an emerging interdisciplinary field that combines biological, chemical, engineering and \n\nlife sciences towards the goal of tissue regeneration [24, 119, 120]. Scaffolds with different \n\narchitectures and pore sizes can be produced from synthetic or naturally occurring materials. BC and \n\ncellulosic nanofibers are widely used as biobased nanoreinforcements in several polymeric matrices \n\nowing to their superior mechanical properties [113, 121]. The high surface area to volume ratio of the \n\nnanofibers combined with their microporous structure favors cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, and \n\ndifferentiation, all of which are highly desired properties for TE applications [122]. The development of \n\nnanofibers can be used to formulate bionanocomposites that can potentially mimic the architecture of \n\nnatural human tissue at the nanometer scale. On a composite perspective, one of the main reasons to \n\nuse cellulose nanofibers is based on their high stiffness, being highly relevant as a reinforcement \n\nstrategy. For example, this can be achieved by breaking down the hierarchical structure of the plant into \n\nindividualized nanofibers of high crystallinity, with a reduction of amorphous parts [10]. Studies have \n\nbeen reported the use of BC alone or combined with HA, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) or cellulose \n\nnanowhiskers (CNWs) as reinforcement strategies, to create bionanocomposites [112, 121, 123-126]. \n\nMCC consists generally of stiff rod-like particles called whiskers, obtained from different natural \n\nresources such as eucalyptus [127], sisal [87], cotton [86, 128], spruce [91, 129], ramine [130], \n\ntunicin [131, 132], among others. The morphology of CNWs from different sources is shown in Figure \n\n1.5. \n\nCNWs possesses: very large surface to volume ratio; good mechanical properties, including high \n\nmodulus, high tensile strength; low coefficient of thermal expansion; and formation of highly porous \n\nmeshes compared to the commercial fibers [2, 10, 128]. In cellulose, each microfibril can be \n\nconsidered as a string of polymer whiskers having a modulus close to that of the perfect crystal of \n\nnative cellulose, which is estimated to be 150 GPa, and possessing a strength of about 10 GPa [136]. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n18 \n\n  \n\n(a) (b) \n\n  \n\n(c) (d) \n\n \n\nFigure 1.5.

Information related with the geometric characteristics of a specific fiber was recently \n\nreviewed by Kalia et al. [3]. \n\nBC fibrils are in the nanometer range and are microscopically similar to collagen fibers [138, 139]. \n\nMoreover, some studies [124, 140] point out the biological capacities of BC, which has shown, for \n\nexample, osteoconduction properties. These characteristics make them particularly interesting to be \n\nused as a collagen-mimicking component in scaffolds. For example, HA with BC has been combined by \n\nWan et al. [124, 141, 142] to prepared a novel class of bionanocomposites SEM observations \n\ndemonstrated that HA crystals were uniformly distributed on the phosphorylated BC fibers after soaking \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n19 \n\nin 1.5 simulated body fluid (SBF) [124]. The 3D network structure revealed that the crystallite size of \n\nthe HA crystals formed on the BC fibers after 7 and 14 days of soaking in 1.5 SBF are nano-sized, \n\ndimensions of 37 nm and 46 nm for 7 and 14 days, respectively [141]. \n\n \n\nTable 1.3.

Research on BC-HA nanocomposites in \n\nthe form of membranes demonstrated the potential application of these systems in TE and bone \n\nregeneration [123, 125, 143]. Fang et al. [123] showed that BC-HA nanocomposite scaffolds were \n\nbiocompatible and could promote cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro. In this study the authors \n\nused stromal cells derived from human bone marrow (hBMSC), and real-time reverse transcription PCR \n\nresults showed that their alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and the expression of osteopontin, \n\nosteocalcin, bone sialoprotein, and ALP mRNA were all higher for cells cultured for 7 days in the \n\npresence of the nanocomposites than for those cultured on pure BC with and without the presence of \n\nosteogenic supplements, such as, L-ascorbic acid, glycerophosphate, and dexamethasone. These \n\nresults suggest that the developed scaffolds have potential for bone TE. Shaska et al. [125] also \n\ndescribed the preparation of membranes composed by BC reinforced with HA and evaluated the \n\nbiological behavior of these membranes for the regeneration of non-critical bone defects in rat tibiae, \n\nthroughout a time period of 16 weeks. The nanocomposites were prepared from BC membranes and \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n20 \n\nincubated in solutions of CaCl2 followed by Na2HPO4. The work revealed that the membranes are \n\neffective for bone regeneration since they accelerated new bone formation. Recently, \n\nbionanocomposites scaffolds based on BC were prepared in a collagen solution followed by freeze-\n\ndrying. The resulted material presented biocompatibility [144]. Collagen was also combined with \n\ncellulose nanofibers to produce nanocomposites as implantable scaffolds in biomedical applications, \n\nmore specifically, for ligament or tendon regeneration [126]. The methodology is based on \n\ngluteraldeyhyde crosslinking; the two composite phases (cellulose nanofibers and collagen) were \n\nprepared by solution casting followed by pH induced in situ partial fibrillation of the collagen phase. The \n\ncollagen fibrils (50 nm of diameter) provided biocompatibility, fatigue resistance and elasticity while the \n\ncellulose nanofibers of 12-39 nm acted as a reinforcing phase. These composites, at room \n\ntemperature, presented mechanical strength of 132\u2013150 MPa and a modulus of 5\u20136 MPa, significantly \n\nhigher than the collagen matrix. Moreover, biocompatibility studies indicated non-cytotoxicity for \n\ncollagen-cellulose bionanocomposites and revealed that the composite surface is promising for cell \n\nadhesion. The main drawback of this methodology is the type of crosslinking agent due to its typical \n\ncytotoxicity. Additionally, collagen-cellulose ratio as well as crosslinking level for collagen phase needs to \n\nbe further improved to match the mechanical performance of natural ligament or tendon. \n\nSome studies on bionanocomposites have been reporting the use of clay or modified clay as \n\nreinforcements to promote the mechanical (e.g., toughness) and interfacial adhesion in matrices \n\nrelevant for the biomedical field, namely: polylactic acid (PLA); poly(butylene succinate) (PBS); \n\npolycaprolactone (PCL); polyhydroxy butyrate (PHB); and aliphatic polyesters blends [145-147]. On the \n\nreinforcement side, few studies have been published concerning the processing of cellulose nanofibers \n\nreinforced nanocomposites by conventional melt compounding, such as extrusion [121, 126, 129]. \n\nMost of these studies were not executed for TE purposes. The use of cellulose whiskers in \n\nbionanocomposites has been mainly limited to hydrophilic matrices due to their surface chemistry \n\n[129] and to its limited production enabling only a lab scale usage. In this sense their exploitation on \n\nnanoreinforcement in biopolymers requires the scale-up of their production in order to achieve higher \n\namounts at an appropriated time and yield [91]. \n\nLignocellulosic materials are quite sensitive to thermal degradation and start to degrade near 230 \u00baC, \n\nrestricting the type of matrix that can be used in association with natural fillers [12, 148]. On the other \n\nhand, during processing, the hydrophilic nature of cellulose promotes the irreversible agglomeration \n\nand aggregation in nonpolar matrices. This is due to the formation of hydrogen bonding between the \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n21 \n\namorphous parts of the nanofibers. Surface modification of the whiskers, have been able to improve \n\ntheir mixability with the hydrophobic matrices. The addition of coupling agents, such as, polyethylene \n\nglycol (PEG) grafting [121]; or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) [129] improves the dispersion of the nanowiskers \n\ninto the matrix. Other chemical treatments have been also reported, and will be discussed in the section \n\ndedicated to modified cellulose. \n\nThe preparation of CNWs reinforced PLA nanocomposites by melt extrusion was carried out by pumping \n\na suspension of CNWs into the polymer melt during the extrusion process using a proper venting \n\nsystem, able to remove the solvent during extrusion [121]. MCC has been used and treated with N,N-\n\ndimethylacetamide (DMAc) containing lithium chloride (LiCl) to swell the MCC and partly separate the \n\ncellulose whiskers. After extrusion the composite structure presented a partial dispersion of the CNWs \n\nmostly when PEG and maleated PLA were used.  The results showed that DMAc/LiCl is effective as \n\nswelling/separation agent for MCC, however it causes degradation of the composites at the high \n\ntemperatures used during processing. The mechanical properties of the maleated PLA/PEG/CNWs \n\nbionanocomposites improved compared to PLA treated with DMAc. The elongation at break increased \n\nabout 800%, the tensile strength 20% and the modulus decreased by 10%. An attempt to use PVA as a \n\ncompatibilizer to promote the dispersion of CNWs within the PLA matrix has also been reported [129].  \n\nPVA is a water-soluble polymer with high tensile strength. The authors hypothesized that the hydroxyl \n\ngroups of the partial hydrolyzed PVA interact with the hydrophilic surfaces of cellulose and the residual \n\nvinyl acetate groups with the hydrophobic PLA. A small improvement was observed in the tensile \n\nmodulus, tensile strength, and elongation at break, indicating that the main responsible for the \n\nmechanical enhancement was derived from the PVA phase reinforced with CNWs and not from the PLA \n\nmatrix. Although, microscopic analysis revealed inadequate dispersion of the CNWs in the PLA phase \n\ndue to the immiscibility of the PLA and PVA. No relevant variation on the thermal performance was \n\nobserved since the CNWs were more allocated to the PVA phase and only a negligible amount was \n\nlocated in the PLA phase. \n\nReplacing the clay reinforcement by cellulose in the form of microfibrils, CNW, BC or MCC leads to fully \n\nnatural-based and renewable bionanocomposite materials with higher mechanical properties and with \n\npotential to be applied in biomedical field. \n\nCNWs from different plant species have been proposed as a reinforcement strategy in the development \n\nof bionanocomposites. Their combination with PVA nanofibers, starch/PVA sponges [128, 149], \n\nchitosan [127] and PLA [129, 150] has demonstrated potential to be used in the biomedical field. Not \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n22 \n\nall of these studies have produced relevant reinforcement improvements in terms of dimensional \n\nstability, mechanical or thermal properties. Enhanced results were obtained with the production of \n\nhoneycomb structures of starch with PVA using freezing-thawing technique [128]. This methodology \n\nproduced stable sponges that were reinforced with CNWs for wound dressing and TE purposes. The \n\nCNWs were homogeneously distributed and restricted the packaging of the starch/PVA sponges, \n\nleading to an improvement of dimensional stability, compression strength and storage modulus. These \n\nbionanocomposites presented biocompatibility and the presence of CNW induced a small reduction on \n\nthe swelling.  More recently, CNWs in the 5-10 nm range have demonstrated a more significant \n\nreinforcement effect on the aligned electrospun PVA fiber webs compared with the isotropic electrospun \n\nfiber webs.  The modulus and tensile strength of the aligned webs obtained by electrospining increased \n\n35% and 45%, respectively. The aligned fibers presented lower diameter when compared with the fibers \n\nproduced with PVA alone. The addition of 15% of CNWs induced a 95% higher tensile strength and an \n\nincrease of 118% in the modulus [149]. \n\nCNWs were recently used by Zhang et al. [151] to prepare a supramolecular hydrogel based on \n\ncyclodextrin/polymer inclusion. It was shown that the incorporation of 0.5 wt% of CNWs into the \n\nhydrogel enhances its gelation, mechanical strength and facilitates sustained release of drugs. The \n\nmodulus of the bionanocomposite hydrogel was 50 times higher than that of the native hydrogel. \n\nFurther evaluation of the bionanocomposite hydrogel, namely cell viability evaluation did not indicate \n\nany additional cytotoxicity. These results support their potential as smart drug delivery systems and as \n\ninjectable biomaterial. \n\nBiodegradable nanocomposites were also obtained with layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly technique [120] \n\nusing chitosan and CNWs from eucalyptus wood. Chitosan is a biodegradable cationic \n\naminopolysaccharide derived from its acetylated form, chitin.  The interaction of chitosan and CNWs \n\noccurred due to the formation of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions between the sulfate \n\ngroups on the whisker surface and the amine groups of chitosan. SEM analysis indicated a dense and \n\nhomogeneous distribution of the CNWs with a formation of a porous network structure that increases \n\nthe contact area and the interfacial adhesion between the rigid polymer and the nanofillers. Moreover, \n\nthe cross section of the assembled films showed a nanometric thickness of ?7 nm per bilayer [127]. \n\nThe relevant contributions of chitosan are its biocompatibility, biodegradability, and antibacterial \n\nproperties, making this polymer suitable for drug delivery, TE, wound healing applications, and as a tool \n\nto produce antimicrobial materials [152-154]. The authors of this study concluded that chitosan lacks \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n23 \n\nthe flexibility necessary for strong adhesion and efficient load transfer between the organic matrix and \n\nthe clay platelets. However, CNWs is reported as an alternative to clay platelets as nanofiller for the \n\npreparation of multilayered nanocomposite films [127].  \n\nThe fabrication of nanoscale devices is currently the subject of a great deal of research; although, \n\nlimited progress has been achieved. The nanoscale constructions using a bottom-up approach to build \n\ndevices have many foreseeable applications in diverse areas, such as: miniaturized electronics; \n\nsensors; and biomedical devices [2, 10, 155]. CNWs are one of the most chemically versatile, \n\nabundant and inexpensive nanoparticles available for nanodevice development [10]. \n\n1.4.2 Modified celluloses and lignin-based materials \n\nThe biocompatibility of cellulose, hemicellulose and their derivatives confers to them biomedical \n\nrelevance. Different chemical modifications have been reported to the cellulose and lignin structures. A \n\nresume of the most relevant ones is compiled in Table 1.4. \n\nIn relation to bone and cartilage TE, one of the most studied chemical modifications is the acetylation of \n\ncellulose hydroxyl moieties (Figure 1.6, Table 1.4), producing cellulose acetate (CA). CA has been used \n\nas isolated component or as part of composites or blends in the development of TE supports. Blending \n\nCA with starch produces starch cellulose acetate (SCA), a biocompatible material that exhibits \n\nbiodegradability and biocompatibility [169]. A series of different CA combinations have been attempted \n\nto produce TE scaffolds [156-164], bone cements [165-168] and drug-delivery vehicles [170-172]. \n\nSCA and CA have been reinforced with HA and bioglasses in the perspective of generating composite \n\nstructures with enhanced bioactivity [160, 161]. Moreover, the surface coating of SCA with a calcium \n\nphosphate (CaP) layer has been proposed as a surface modification technique to improve the surface \n\nbioactivity of SCA [159]. The compounding of SCA with nanosized HA, generates composite nanofibre \n\nmeshes that improves the calcium deposition by the osteoblasts as demonstrated by Von Kossa \n\nstaining and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity [160]. The microhardness of SCA immersed for 30 \n\ndays in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) decreases to, approximately, 94% of its initial value [156]; this \n\nvariation was accompanied by a weight loss of 16% and a water uptake of 50%, being the highest \n\nvariations compared to the starch-polycaprolactone (SPCL) blend. It was reported by the authors that \n\nthese variation has a more dramatic influence in the surface morphology and roughness, generating a \n\nnegative impact in the osteoblast adhesion and proliferation.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n24 \n\nTable 1.4.

This set of studies used SCA has a filler of acrylic resins based on the combination of \n\nmethylmethacrylate and acrylic acid. With the use of 55-60% of SCA the authors were able to produce a \n\ncement formulation that fulfills the requirements of the ASTM standard for acrylic bone cements [165]. \n\nThe cement formulation was reinforced with bioactive glass compositions or HA and their mechanical \n\nbehavior and bioactivity was significantly enhanced [166, 167]. \n\nCA phthalate-based formulations have been proposed as drug-delivery vehicles, for the controlled \n\nrelease of stimulants for bone formation (e.g. parathyroid hormone, simvastatin), and their efficiency \n\nhas been proven both in vitro and in vivo [170-172]. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n26 \n\nHydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) and \n\ntheir silanized derivatives, has been proposed as a component for the preparation of injectable bone \n\ncements [174, 175, 177-181] and as 3D scaffolds for bone and cartilage regeneration [182-184]. In \n\nthe bone cement formulations such materials are added at a percentage between 2 and 3% due to its \n\ngelification properties, being used as a carrier of the solid component, e.g. CaP phases. HPC has been \n\nreported to enhance bone formation when added to bone cement formulations [174]. HPMC is able to \n\npromote the formation of a crystalline CaP phase in the surface of biphasic CaP [179]. HPMC also \n\nproved to be non-cytotoxic in formulations of injectable hybrid bone cements, without altering the \n\nbiological properties of the inorganic phase [180]. \n\nCarboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) reinforced with nano-sized HA has been tested as bionanocomposites \n\n[186] for bone regeneration in a TE approach. The addition of chitosan to these formulations was \n\nreported as a methodology to control the biodegradation rate of the composites [187]. Substitution \n\nmaterials for bone repair should have good biocompatibility and a suitable biodegradation rate, as well \n\nas higher mechanical properties to support the ingrowth of new bone tissue. Studies involving a tri-\n\ncomponent polyelectrolyte composite structure of chitosan and CMC with nano HA have demonstrated \n\npotential for that purpose [187, 188, 194].  In a first case using a co-solution method to produce the \n\ncomposites was possible to obtain a morphology and size similar to natural bone with improved \n\ncompressive strength when compared to HA/chitosan based composites [188]. Combining nano HA \n\nwith chitosan and cross-linking with CMC in a weight ratio (40/30/30) it was obtained an organic \n\nnetwork structure of polyelectrolyte complexes with nanometer crystals of HA uniformly distributed. \n\nThese structures presented a high compressive strength, acceptable biodegradation and high bioactivity \n\n[187]. Self-assembly of static electricity methodology was used to create polyelectrolyte complex \n\nmembranes with similar compositions obtaining the previously improved mechanical, degradation, \n\nswelling and bioactivity characteristics. The combination of chitosan/CMC previously ionic cross-linked \n\nwith 40 wt.% of nano HA presents a compressive strength near 120MPa that meets the requirement for \n\nbone repair material and can be used as biomimetic bone repair material [194]. \n\nWithin the context of bionanocomposites, CNW has a largely unexploited potential within the biomedical \n\nfield. Their high surface area to volume ratio may change drastically the properties of CNW through the \n\nmanipulation of its surface chemistry [10]. One of the drawbacks of the CNW is its poor compatibility \n\nwith nonpolar solvents or resins due to its hydrophilic nature [2], and the thermal degradation of the \n\ncellulosic components at high temperatures [121]; although, the presence of reactive hydroxyl groups \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n27 \n\nenable a variety of chemical modifications mediated by organic solvents [130, 132], crosslinking agents \n\n[132, 195] or using surfactants [197]. \n\nThe synthesis of BC in the presence of methylcellulose (MC) and CMC has been reported [191] to \n\nenhance the water adsorption capability of BC. MC was used in combination with the triblock co-\n\npolymers P123 and F127 to generate mesopores and macropores in bioglass formulations developed \n\nas scaffolds for bone TE [192]. \n\nSvensson et al. [112] tested native and chemically modified BC as supports structures for cartilage TE. \n\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, and RNA expression of the collagen II from human \n\nchondrocytes seeded on the BC-based supports, indicated that unmodified BC induces the proliferation \n\nof chondrocytes. Moreover, it was observed by TEM the ingrowth of chondrocytes into the bulk of the \n\nBC scaffold. This work showed that BC is a promising material for the development of cartilage TE \n\nscaffolds. BC has been also modified with xyloglucan and RGD aminoacid sequence as a tool to \n\npromote endothelial cell adhesion. This strategy is highly relevant for bone TE in an attempt to promote \n\nvascularization [198]. \n\nRecently, Fillponen et al. [196] proposed the functionalization of cellulose through the adsorption of a \n\nsurface layer of CMC modified with azide or alkyne moieties followed by a \u201cclick\u201d chemistry strategy to \n\nfunctionalize the CMC surface with bovine serum albumin (BSA) or PEG. The authors report that this \n\nstrategy can be also employed with other molecules, such as fluorescent dyes or other types of proteins. \n\nThis methodology can be exploited in the biomedical field through the decoration of the cellulose \n\nsurface with biochemical cues to induce different types of cellular responses. \n\nIn contrast to cellulose-based materials, the lignin counterpart has not yet been significantly exploited in \n\nthe biomedical field. However, its natural origin, and its abundance in renewable feedstocks motivated \n\nsome attempts in recent years. \n\nSeveral chemical modifications on lignins are reported in the literature [28, 48, 55, 60, 199]; although, \n\nvery few of them were already been tested in the preparation of materials with biological relevance \n\nwithin the field of bone and cartilage TE. However, Kraft lignin has been reinforced with HA and beta-\n\ntricalcium phosphate (TCP) to produce composite structures for bone TE [193]. It was observed the \n\nformation of porosities between 50 and 100 \u00b5m upon sintering at 900 \u00baC. These pores were derived \n\nfrom the positions that lignin occupied before the thermal treatment and occur due to its degradation. \n\nThe combination of conducting polymers with lignin can produce anti-oxidant materials capable of \n\nreducing the oxidative stress of the surrounding biological tissue. It has been shown that a combination \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n28 \n\nof polyanyline (PANI), poly(anilinesulfonic acid) or polypyrrole (Ppy) with lignin generate materials with \n\nanti-oxidant capacity. These results lead the authors to suggested that this type of materials are relevant \n\ncoatings of different polymeric scaffolds or biomedical implants with the capacity to reduce the foreign \n\nbody response [200]. \n\n1.4.3 Pyrolised lignocellulosic structures \n\nInspired by Nature and following a biomimetic approach, natural wood cellular structures have been \n\nselected to serve as a 3D porous scaffold for bone TE [98, 100, 201-203]. After appropriated material \n\nselection, including a characterization of the wood specie (balsa, oak, rattan, eucalyptus, pine, birch, \n\namong others), a development strategy was established through the controlled pyrolyzation (under inert \n\natmosphere) of wood samples. This methodology produced a porous preform of carbon that is \n\nchemically infiltrated, generating a coated inner surface of the wood cell walls which gave rises to \n\nbiomorphic oxides (Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, MnO and ZrO2) [204-208] or, alternatively, carbide phases (SiC, TiC \n\nand ZrC) [201, 209-211]. As an example, SiC structure is produced by the spontaneous reaction \n\nbetween molten infiltrated Si with the preform carbon to form SiC-based material. The result is a \n\nbiomorphic SiC ceramic material (bioSiC) that replicates the highly interconnected microstructure of the \n\nwood cell wall [201, 203]. The biodiversity of natural wood offers a variety of morphologies and \n\nchemical compositions that can be exploited in the development of constructs relevant for the \n\nbiomedical field. They have the potential to form structures with unique pore distributions, from the \n\nmicro to nanometer scale. When developing this type of materials for biomedical applications it is \n\nrelevant to analyze their osteointegration capacity and biocompatibility. In vitro bioactivity studies were \n\nperformed by means of immersing these types of samples in SBF. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis \n\n(EDS) analysis confirmed the formation of a dense CaP layer, demonstrating that, coating the bioSiC \n\nwith bioactive silicate glass it is possible to improve its osteoconducting properties [203]. Additionally, \n\nthe culturing of human osteoblast-like cells in the presence of these materials demonstrated a cell \n\nproliferation rate similar to the positive controls without cytotoxicity response [212]. Additionally they \n\nhave demonstrated good biomechanical performance [203, 213]. In vivo biocompatibility studies in the \n\nfemur of rabbits were also performed. Histological results of a bioSiC construct after 12 weeks of \n\nimplantation confirmed the existence of new bone within the bulk of the SiC porous matrix. Moreover, \n\nno tissue inflammation was detected in the surrounding tissue [213]. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n29 \n\nRecently it was proposed [202] a new process to transform the starting wood into a HA porous scaffold. \n\nAfter the decomposition of the wood organic components, the remaining structure was infiltrated with \n\ncalcium vapor over the carbon structure to produce calcium carbide (CaC). Using a multi-step chemical \n\nand physical process, presented in the scheme of Figure 1.7, it was possible to convert the calcium \n\ncarbide into a spongy carbonated HA scaffolds to act as artificial bone. \n\n \n\nRaw Materials: \nPine wood and rattan\n\nP\ny\n\nro\nly\n\nsi\ns:\n\n \nW\n\no\no\n\nd\n?\n\n c\na\n\nrb\no\n\nn\n\nC\na\n\nrb\nu\n\nri\nza\n\nti\no\n\nn\n: \n\nC\na\n\nrb\no\n\nn\n?\n\n C\na\n\nC\n2\n\nO\nx\n\nid\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n: \n\nC\na\n\nC\n2\n\n?\n C\n\na\nO\n\nC\na\n\nrb\no\n\nn\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n: \n\nC\na\n\nO\n?\n\n C\na\n\nC\nO\n\n3\n\nP\nh\n\no\nsp\n\nh\na\n\nti\nza\n\nti\no\n\nn\n: \n\nC\na\n\nC\nO\n\n3\n?\n\n H\nyd\n\nro\nxy\n\na\np\n\na\nti\n\nte\n\nStep 1 Step 2 Step 3 Step 4 Step 5\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.7.

Hydrogels are a class of biomaterials that have demonstrated great \n\npotential for biological and medical applications [22, 215-217]. These structures can absorb from 20% \n\nup to thousands of times their dry weight [216, 218]. They are highly relevant and appealing for \n\nbiomedical applications since they usually are biocompatible, the aqueous environment of the hydrogel \n\ncan protect cells and fragile drugs (such as peptides, proteins, etc.), they present good transport of \n\nnutrient to cells and metabolic products from the cells, they may be easily modified with cell adhesion \n\nligands, or they can be injected in vivo as a liquid that gelifies at body temperature [216]. Usually they \n\ndo not dissolve in water due to its permanent cross-linked network (chemical or physical). Some \n\nhydrogel systems have attracted significant attention in the biomedical field due to their stimuli-\n\nresponsive swelling-deswelling capabilities without disintegration, and their biocompatibility [23, 215, \n\n219]. Polysaccharides are one class of polymers that are able to form hydrogels that are highly \n\nhydrated and porous, being similar to living tissue. When implanted, these hydrophilic materials allow \n\nthe permeation of water, metabolic products and chemical signals in the aqueous physiological \n\nenvironment [140]. Polysaccharides such as chitosan [64, 118, 220, 221], starch-based [222, 223], \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n31 \n\ngellan gum [17, 224, 225], hyaluronic acid [226-228] and alginate [50, 229] have been widely used to \n\nprepare natural hydrogels. They present the advantages of being biocompatible, biodegradable, low \n\ntoxicity, and high availability from renewable resources [120, 219, 220]. The main areas in which \n\nhydrogels are used as biomaterials are in contact lenses, synthetic wound coverings, drug-delivery \n\nsystems, permselective membranes, and in organ and tissue replacements, such as, skin, tendon, \n\ncartilage, heart valve stents, and bone [109]. Examples of the use of lignocellulosic-based hydrogels in \n\nthe biomedical field, during the last decade, are presented in Table 1.5. \n\n \n\nTable 1.5.

Several water-soluble cellulose derivatives can be used as mono-component of multi-\n\ncomponent systems to form hydrogel networks possessing specific properties in terms of swelling \n\ncapability and sensitivity to external stimuli [21]. They can be prepared from a cellulose solution \n\nthrough physical cross-linking. As it was pointed out before, cellulose has several hydroxyl moieties able \n\nto form an interlinked network stabilized by hydrogen bonding. However, it is usually difficult to dissolve \n\ncellulose in common solvents due to its highly extended hydrogen bonded structure, being one of the \n\nmain challenges in the development of cellulose-based hydrogels. A recent work on cellulose hydrogels \n\nrefers new solvents, such as N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO), ionic liquids (ILs), and alkali/urea \n\n(or thiourea) aqueous systems that have been developed to dissolve cellulose, providing a set of new \n\nopportunities for the preparation of cellulose hydrogels [22]. The current trend in the design of \n\ncellulose-based hydrogels is associated to the use of non-toxic crosslinking agents or crosslinking \n\nchemical treatments, to further improve the safety of both the final product and the manufacturing \n\nprocess. \n\nBC was also used to prepare a nanostructured hydrogels for TE. BC has more than 200 times higher \n\nsurface area than isolated softwood cellulose. Compared with cellulose from plants, BC possesses \n\nhigher water holding capacity, higher crystallinity, higher tensile strength, and a finer web-like network \n\n[141, 185].   \n\nHutchens et al. [140] have used BC hydrogels as templates to form biomimetic calcium-deficient \n\nhydroxyapatite (CdHA). After the purification process, the cellulose was incubated in solutions of \n\ncalcium chloride followed by dibasic sodium phosphate. An amount of apatite higher than 50% of total \n\ndry weight was incorporated throughout the hydrogel. Their results indicate that CdHA spherical clusters \n\n(1mm) are composed by nanosized crystallites that were formed inside the BC network. The formation \n\nof this bionanocomposite is similar to the physiological biomineralization of bone producing apatite \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n34 \n\ncrystals of comparable shape and size. XRD analysis showed that the CdHA is comprised of anisotropic \n\n10\u201350 nm elongated crystallites mimicking the geometry of bone apatite crystals. Combining the \n\nbiocompatibility of BC with the bioactivity of CdHA, these bionanocomposites are promising materials to \n\nbe used as scaffold for bone TE [235]. It was also observed that the CdHA implants are rapidly \n\nincorporated into the bone tissue due to its high biocompatibility and strong bioactivity [140]. \n\nMillon et al. [109, 245] have considered hydrophilic BC fibers combined with PVA to form a \n\nbionanocomposite that mimic the role of collagen and elastin, respectively. Their main objective was to \n\nevaluate its use as cardiovascular tissue replacements. More recently, Mohammadi [246] presented a \n\nnovel technique to exploit the anisotropy and the non-linear mechanical properties of BC-PVA hydrogels \n\nin the development of heart valves. Hydrogels based on BC-PVA were prepared for cornea replacement, \n\ndue to their high water content, high visible light transmittance, suitable UV absorbance, high \n\nmechanical strength and appropriated thermal properties [247]. However these systems require further \n\nimprovements before being tested under clinical applications.  \n\nAfter the discovery that electrical signals can regulate cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation, \n\nresearchers sought to incorporate conducting polymers into biomaterials to take advantage of the \n\nelectrical stimuli [256]. Polyaniline (PAni) is a conductive electroactive polymer, where the reaction time \n\nof polymerization, the type and concentration of doping acids plays the main role in the electro-\n\nconductivity properties of the composites. BC-PAni nanofiber composite is an electro-conductive \n\nhydrogel that combines the properties of hydrogels and conductive systems [248]. The study showed \n\nthat PAni could be synthesized on the surface of BC nanofibers and assembled into a novel 3D \n\nmembrane structure, enhancing considerably the composite electroconductivity.  The nanocomposites \n\nmay potentially be used for flexible displays, biosensors, and platform substrates to study the effect of \n\nelectrical signals on cell activity or to direct desirable cell function in TE applications. \n\nInterpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs), consist of a combination of two or more polymer networks \n\nsynthesized in juxtaposition, i.e. a blend of two or more cross-linked polymers, which may be \n\nincompatible, but are physically interlocked, forming a 3D structure between its constituent phases \n\n[257]. IPNs can be divided into two specific forms [17, 22]: sequential IPN and semi-IPN. In the case of \n\nsequential IPN, cellulose is used as the first network and the second network is synthesized by \n\npolymerization in the presence of the cellulose network. When cellulose or its derivative is linear or \n\nbranched in a cross-linked network, it is called as semi-IPN hydrogel [22]. In the biomedical field, high \n\nmechanical strength double-network (DN) hydrogels, combining BC and gelatin, has been prepared by \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n35 \n\nGong and coworkers [17]. Gelatin is a polypeptide derived from collagen, one of the main constituents \n\nof the ECM. A BC-gelatin system in the form of a gel can retain water and recover consecutively from \n\ncompression [22]. The authors have prepared BC-gelatin hydrogels by immersing BC gel in aqueous \n\ngelatin solution, followed by cross-linking with N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N\u2019-ethylcarbodiimide \n\nhydrochloride (EDC), generating a sequential IPN hydrogel. The tensile strength of the DN hydrogel \n\nalong the direction of the stratified layer and the compressive strength in the direction perpendicular to \n\nthe stratified layer was about 112 times and 31 times higher than that of gelatin gels, respectively. A \n\nsimilar enhancement on the mechanical strength was reported for the combination of BC with other \n\npolysaccharides such as sodium alginate, gellan gum and carrageenan [17]. Moreover, these hydrogels \n\npresent a low friction coefficient of the order of 10-3 and potential to be used as artificial cartilage. \n\n1.5.2 Modified cellulose-based materials \n\nCellulose derivatives can be tuned to produce hydrogel structures, either reversible or stable, through \n\ntheir covalent cross-linking using aqueous solutions of cellulose ethers, such as, methylcellulose (MC), \n\nhydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) \n\n[258]. \n\nHPC and its chemical derivatives have been proposed as smart responsive materials [29] for drug-\n\ndelivery applications [29, 173]. Its use as an oral administration vehicle with thermo- and pH-responsive \n\ncapacity has been reported, showing stability at acidic pH and enhanced degradation rate at neutral pH. \n\nAdditionally, the HPC hydrogels reduce their swelling rate with increasing temperature [29]. HPC was \n\nrecently tested in a phase II clinical trial for the controlled release of FGF-2 targeting periodontal bone \n\nregeneration in patients diagnosed with periodontitis. The results showed a significant increase in the \n\nalveolar bone height, which was used by the authors as an argument to prove that these delivery \n\nsystems in combination with FGF-2 stimulate bone regeneration [174]. A delay in the delivery of \n\ngentamicin from CaP bone cements was proposed by the addition of HPC to the formulation [176]. \n\nThe delivery of cells using a noninvasive surgery can be achieved using injectable scaffolds [183]; \n\nalthough, the desired cell-based construct has to be retained at the repair site after being injected. \n\nConsidering these requirements, some strategies were developed using a hydrophilic polymer able to \n\nexhibit self-reticulation properties in order to promote the mechanical integrity of the gel phase.  \n\nHPMC grafted with silanol groups (Si-HPMC) is a self-hardening gel at the physiological pH and has \n\nbeen proposed to promote cartilage and bone regeneration [182, 183] also as injectable systems [184, \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n36 \n\n259]. Si-HPMC hydrogels have been also proposed as injectable bone cements for the treatment of \n\nperiodontal defects, with the advantage of being able to promote new bone formation 3 months after in \n\nvivo implantation. Additionally, it was reported that Si-HPMC promotes the fixation of the inorganic \n\nphase in the intervention area [181]. Vinatier et al. [184], proposed Si-HPMC hydrogels as TE supports \n\ncapable of promoting chondrocyte proliferation. The study reported that chondrocytes were \n\nmetabolically active, and were able to produce glycosaminoglycans. Overall, it was concluded that Si-\n\nHPMC is a promising material for cartilage TE. More recently, it was proposed an injectable therapeutic \n\nstrategy for the regeneration of articular cartilage using autologous rabbit nasal chondrocytes (RNC) \n\nwith Si-HPMC hydrogel [241]. The use of nasal chondrocytes presents the advantages of reducing \n\ndonor site morbidity while exhibiting greater chondrogenic potential than articular chondrocytes [260]. \n\nAfter 6 weeks of in vitro studies, histological analysis of autologous RNC transplanted in an articular \n\ncartilage defect revealed the formation of new cartilage tissue with a histological organization similar to \n\nthat of healthy articular cartilage. Moreover, immunohistological analysis of type II collagen suggested \n\nthat the new tissue was a hyaline-like cartilage [241]. \n\nOrthopedic devices made from biodegradable materials present advantages over metal or \n\nnondegradable materials since they can transfer stress over time to the damaged area as it heals, and \n\nthere is no need of a second surgery to remove the implanted devices [256]. Cellulose phosphate (CP) \n\nhas been investigated as a biomaterial for orthopedic applications to improve the osseointegration of \n\ncellulose. Granja et al. [231, 261] have studied the phosphorylation of regenerated cellulose hydrogels \n\nusing MCC. Their work assessed the mineralization potential of CP, i.e. the ability of a material to \n\ninduce the formation of an apatite layer in a SBF, revealing that only the Ca salt of CP promoted \n\nformation of apatite. It was reported that the interface between the polymer and the mineral layer was \n\ncontinuous [231]. Moreover, moderate degrees of surface phosphorylation were able to induce \n\nmineralization. \n\nIn a different work, the pre-incubation of unmodified regenerated cellulose hydrogels with Ca resulted in \n\nthe formation of a homogeneous apatite layer. However, in this case, the interface between the polymer \n\nand the mineral layer was not continuous [234, 262].  \n\nGranja et al. [230, 232, 233] also studied the biocompatibility of CP under in vitro and in vivo \n\nconditions. Their in vitro biocompatibility was studied in cultures of human Bone Marrow Stromal Cells \n\n(hBMSC), showing that CP is not cytotoxic, independently of the phosphate content [233, 262]. In \n\nanother in vitro study, it was reported that regenerated cellulose hydrogels showed good rates of \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n37 \n\nhBMSC proliferation after 22 days in culture and it was observed an homogeneous colonizatrion of the \n\nsurface of the materials [232].  It is important to indicate that these structures without cells do not \n\nmineralize. Animal implantation studies were performed in rabbits and the results revealed that both \n\nunmodified and phosphorylated cellulose were biocompatible and reveal osteoconductive properties \n\n[230]. A complete osseointegration was not observed, although some remodeling activity of the bone \n\ntissue was referred when CP was used. These works showed that regenerated cellulose hydrogels \n\npresented potential to be applied in different orthopedic applications. \n\nCMC hydrogels have been also tested for the containment of the inorganic phases in CaP bone \n\ncements. They presented degradation between 50 to 60% at the second week of experiment and no \n\nnegative impact in the bioactivity of CaP. CMC-CaP formulations possess osteoinductive properties, \n\nallowing the formation of ectopic bone at the same level as the CMC-free CaP [50]. The coating of \n\ncellulose-based scaffolds with CMC induces the formation of CaP crystalline phases on their surface \n\n[162, 189], therefore promoting bioactivity. More recently, polyelectrolyte complexes composed by CMC, \n\nchitosan and polyglutamic acid presented significant antibacterial properties and limited in vivo foreign \n\nbody response [190]. Additionally, polyelectrolyte hydrogels present a high sensitivity to their sorption \n\ncapacity. This can be manipulated by varying the ionic strength and pH of the external solutions [21, \n\n239]. \n\nThe smart behavior of some cellulose derivatives, such as, NaCMC and HPMC, in response to \n\nphysiologically variables (i.e., pH, temperature, ionic strength) makes the lignocellulosic-based \n\nhydrogels appealing for in vivo applications in the field of TERM. Recently, Eyholzer et al. [217] have \n\ndemonstrated the potential of nanofibrillated CMC in the preparation of hydrogels for the replacement of \n\nnucleus pulposus in intervertebral discs. The methodology consisted in the UV polymerization of N-vinyl-\n\n2-pyrrolidone in a suspension of nanofibrillated CMC, using Tween 20 trimethacrylate as cross-linking \n\nagent. The results of the study showed that the developed hydrogels could successfully mimic the \n\nmechanical and swelling behavior of the nucleous pulposus. \n\n1.5.3 Hemicellulose and modified hemicellulose-based materials \n\nHemicelluloses present sufficient hydrophilic functional groups (hydroxyl and carboxyl) on their \n\nbackbones to act as reactive sites for chemical modification. They are widely available feedstocks and \n\nconfer relevant properties to their corresponding hydrogels, e.g. renewability, biodegradability and \n\nbiocompatibility [23]. Recently Albertsson et al. [251] presented a new method to prepare hydrogels \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n38 \n\nfrom chemically modified hemicelluloses. The procedure used a freeze-dried hemicellulose rich fraction \n\nand can be described as a three-step procedure: (1) the synthesis of cross-linkable precursors by \n\nactivating 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA) with N,N-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI); (2) the covalent \n\nattachment of the cross-linkable precursor to the polysaccharide backbones (DMSO); and (3) cross-\n\nlinking the hydrogels through the reaction between the HEMA-modified hemicellulose and free HEMA \n\nmolecules. The developed hydrogels presented a swelling that is greatly dependent on the degree of \n\nHEMA substitution and the co-monomer to hemicellulose ratio. Swelling was found to reduce with \n\nincreasing HEMA substitution degree [23]. The main drawback of this methodology is related to the \n\nhigh cost derived from the synthesis of the intermediate precursors. \n\nGalactoglucomannan (GGM) is the main hemicellulose in Norway Spruce (Picea abies), the most \n\ncommon raw material used in the thermochemical mills in Scandinavia. It can be used isolated after an \n\nestablished procedure involving microfiltration [249]. O-acetyl-GGM (AcGGM) is the major softwood \n\nhemicellulose, and the synthesis of AcGGM hydrogels can be achieved by chemical grafting of acrylates \n\nand their subsequent cross-linking. BSA was encapsulated into HEMA-grafted AcGGM hydrogels, and its \n\nrelease was studied as a function of the HEMA grafting degree and of the addition ?-mannanase to \n\nhydrolyze the hydrogel. The hydrogel preparation procedure involved the enzymatic modification of the \n\nAcGGM chains and synthetic coupling of HEMA. Two parameters were found to influence the release of \n\nBSA in water: the degree of substitution of HEMA and the presence of ?-mannanase [250]. While lower \n\nrelease of BSA occurred for an HEMA grafting degree between 0.10 and 0.36, the presence of ?-\n\nmannanase increased the BSA release. This study demonstrated the potential of HEMA grafted AcGGM \n\nhydrogels as drug delivery vehicles. \n\nHydrogels usually exhibits low mechanical resistance; therefore, a significant effort has been made to \n\ndevelop hydrogel reinforcement strategies that do not compromise their water absorption capacity. A \n\ntype of strategy already mentioned for the cellulose-based hydrogels is the assembling of IPNs or semi-\n\nIPNs. These strategies can produce hydrogels with enhanced mechanical performance [23]. Hydrogels \n\nbased on semi-IPN of hemicellulose and chitosan have been investigated [220]. A recent work [23] \n\nreviews two distinct routes to prepare hydrogels based on semi-IPN of hemicellulose and chitosan. The \n\nfirst method is based on the mixing of two different solutions, of hemicellulose and chitosan, and \n\nsubsequent cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. The second method consists in mixing hemicellulose with \n\nchitosan in the dry form and then dissolving the mixture in acidified water. A recent work performed by \n\nKaraaslan et al., [220] using the first method, produced hydrogel films based on semi-IPN with high \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n39 \n\nmolecular weight hemicellulose and chitosan. The resulting hydrogel presented a pH-responsive drug \n\ndelivery using riboflavin as a model active agent. These results demonstrated that hemicellulose-based \n\nhydrogels are capable to crystallize in the presence of 50 wt% of chitosan, acting as reinforcement \n\ncomponent within the semi-IPN structure. Additionally higher swelling ratios were observed with the \n\nincrease of hemicellulose content due to the lower degree of crosslinking and higher hydrophylicity [23, \n\n220]. \n\n1.5.4 Lignin-based materials \n\nThe incorporation of lignin can lead to an increase on the thermal stability, hydrophilicity, \n\nbiocompatibility and biodegradability of hydrogels [95]. Similar to the hemicellulose, lignin-based \n\nmolecules can be used in semi-IPN hydrogels. A recent work [95] reports the development of \n\nsuperabsorbent hydrogels based on different types of lignin. These materials are semi-IPN hydrogels \n\nwith structures between lignin and xanthan gum, an anionic extracellular bacterial polysaccharide \n\nknown to be biocompatible, biodegradable and to exhibit gel-like properties. These lignin-based semi-\n\nIPN hydrogels are prepared by a crosslinking reaction with epichlorohydrin, followed by intensive \n\nwashing to remove the unreacted crosslinking agent. The methodology leads to a biodegradable \n\nsuperabsorbent hydrogel with high swelling rate in aqueous media. The study revealed that the nature \n\nof lignin influences the thermo-oxidative stability and the swelling properties of the hydrogels. \n\nThe performance of the lignin based gels could be improved by means of a chemical modification of the \n\nstarting lignin [23]. As an example lignin hydrogels can be prepared by crosslinking it with polyethylene \n\nglycol diglycidyl ether [254]. The lignin-based hydrogels swells in water: ethanol mixtures and in alkaline \n\nsolutions, and they shrink upon heating. The swelling properties of such materials are attributable to \n\nlignin. This study was not developed in a biomedical perspective, although, the results confirm that \n\nlignin-based hydrogels have a large unexploited potential for the development of drug delivery systems. \n\nLignin has been also used in the development of a thermo-responsive hydrogel [255]. These \u201csmart\u201d \n\nmaterials have the ability to respond to temperature changes, modifying their gelling behavior [263]. \n\nThermo-responsive lignin-based hydrogel were developed by Feng et al. [255]. This was achieved by \n\nreaction between acetic acid lignin with NIPA, generating NIPA-g-lignin. The developed material \n\npresented a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of 31 \u00baC with tunable pore sizes (between 20 \n\nand 100 \u00b5m) that is dependent on the percentage of lignin fraction. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n40 \n\n1.6 Some recent applications in the biomedical field \n\nWith the rapid diminishment of oil resources and serious environmental pollution caused by the refining \n\nof petrochemical products, alternative and sustainable resources have attracted a growing interest \n\namong researchers. The increase of knowledge on the lignocellulosic components acted as a leverage \n\non its use as composites in the biomedical field. \n\nWound dressing systems based on pure oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC) have been developed \n\nsuch as Tabotamp\u00ae and as well as a mixture from collagen and ORC named Promogran\u00ae. Tabotamp\u00ae is \n\na thin gauze layer from pure ORC that is used in acute wounds like trauma, surgical injuries and burns. \n\nIt provides hemostatic and antimicrobial properties [264]. Collagen is recognized as the major \n\ncomponent of the ECM and serves as a natural substrate for cell attachment, proliferation and \n\ndifferentiation.  Collagen has been employed as a matrix material for TE and wound dressing [265]. \n\nPromogran\u00ae, is a commercial spongy collagen matrix (55%) containing ORC (45%) that has been \n\nrecently introduced in the US and European markets for the treatment of exuding diabetic and ulcer \n\nwounds [265, 266]. This product is a dressing consisting of a sterile, freeze-dried matrix and combines \n\nthe properties of its components, such as fluid absorption and haemostatic properties.  \n\nBC in the form of membranes has been applied for guided bone regeneration in: bone defects of critical \n\nand noncritical size [125]; in periodontal lesions [181]; and as a resorbable barrier membrane for \n\npreventing the invasion of fibroblast cells and fibrous connective tissue into the bone defects [123]. \n\nResults from the literature indicate that BC membranes promote effective bone formation at the site, \n\nbesides being a low-cost treatment [125, 267, 268].  \n\nThe current trend in the design of cellulose-based hydrogels is related to the use of non-toxic \n\ncrosslinking agents or crosslinking treatments, to further improve the safety of both the final product \n\nand the manufacturing process [21]. Hydrogels are considered optimum candidates to be used in \n\nwound dressings. In this sense hydrogels should be designed to maintain the appropriated moisture in \n\nthe wound; relieve the pain, not adhere to the wound; and conform to the body shape [269]. Several \n\nsystems based on natural or synthetic solutions are patented [270-272] or on the market [273, 274] \n\noffering additional characteristics, including non-adherent dressings or systems comprising \n\nantimicrobial agents in their formulations. Several of the hydrogels applied on wound dressing present \n\nwater content between 70 and 95%. The most cited commercially available hydrogels designed as \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n41 \n\nwound dressing systems are listed in Table 1.6, including examples from the literature [21, 139, 140, \n\n269, 274, 275].  \n\n \n\nTable 1.6.

Some commercial products use silver particles on the hydrogel \n\ncomposition to confer antimicrobial activity. After approval from the Food and Drug Administration, \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n42 \n\nXylos Corporation (USA) is commercializing a skin substitute based on BC (XCell). This material it \n\nreferred to maintain the moisture balance in the wound and to speed up healing and epithelialization \n\n[140, 274]. BC has been widely investigated for wound healing due to its purity and high water \n\nretention capacity, and a series of BC-based wound dressings are currently on the market. Their \n\npotential as wound dressing has been reviewed by Czaja et al. [20, 139]. BC has been used in cartilage \n\nTE [112, 276], replacement of blood vessels in rats [16] and in wound healing processes [20, 139]. \n\nHydrogels based on BNC mimic basic living processes and are of growing importance as bioactive \n\nscaffolds.  \n\nFrom the large number of different cellulose derivatives, HPMC is the one that has been more \n\ncommercially exploited as a pharmaceutical excipient and as vehicle for controlled drug delivery. The \n\npolymer molecular weight (Mw) is of significant importance due to its intimate relation with the delivery \n\nprofile of the loaded drug. In this sense, by controlling the polymer Mw it is possible to adapt the drug-\n\nrelease profile to the required timeframe and rate. This strategy has been recently reported in the new \n\nline of BenecelTM (Ashland Inc.) commercial HPMC excipients [273]. \n\n1.7 Concluding remarks and future trends \n\nThe development of scaffolds that mimic the architecture of tissue at the nanoscale is one of the major \n\nchallenges in the field of TE in the last 15 years. The development of nanofibers, has greatly enhanced \n\nthe scope for fabricating scaffolds that can potentially meet this challenge. Agricultural fibers represent \n\nan abundant, inexpensive, and readily available source of renewable lignocellulosic components that \n\ncan be used integrated in a biorefinery process.  \n\nCellulose is the most abundant natural polymer on Earth, which is an almost inexhaustible source of \n\nraw material for the increasing demand for environmentally friendly and biocompatible products. \n\nTherefore, cellulose based materials have become one of the most important bioresources in the 21st \n\ncentury. This increasing relevance induced the investment on bionanocomposites research targeting \n\nbiomedical purposes. This also includes its purified, modified or biodegradable constituents that are \n\nused as matrix or nano-reinforcements. \n\nA relevant, and still unexplored, component of plants is suberin. Its general chemical structure is \n\npolyester-based, one of the most common type of FDA-approved synthetic biomaterial, e.g. PLA, PLGA, \n\netc. Usually, these FDA-approved synthetic polyesters used in the development of biomedical materials \n\nare hydrophobic. Additionally, the chemical characterization of suberin structure has shown the \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n43 \n\npresence of a high concentration of hydroxyl moieties [96]. This feature can be used as an added value \n\ndue to the possibility of synthesizing suberin-based polyester structures with pendant hydroxyl groups \n\nthat promotes some hydrophilicity [74]. Suberin or chemical modified suberin from bark was already \n\napplied in composites to promote adhesion between the phases and to enhance their mechanical \n\nperformance [277]. It is envisaged a large spectrum of possible applications for these structures, \n\nalthough, polymerization studies need to be executed to understand the real potential of suberin-based \n\npolymeric structures in the biomedical area. Under the current environmental, societal and political \n\nstatus there is a pressing need for innovative, sustainable and recyclable materials. Figure 1.9 presents \n\na schematic representation of possible future trends and effects on lignocellulosic-based \n\nbionanocomposites relevant for the biomedical field. There is a gradual tendency to move to greener \n\nmaterials made from renewable resources where the lignocellulosic components or templates have a \n\nrelevant potential. \n\n \n\n2000 2010 2020 2030\n\nHigh-growth developments:\n- Biomedical materials for artificial Engineered\ntissues\n- Bio-based systems like lab-on-a-chip\n- Miniaturized Sensors &amp; Chips (including bio-\nbased)\n\nLow-growth developments:\n- Slow introduction and long testing to validate \nmaterials and methodologies\n- Improvement strategies of the existing \nnanocomposite materials\n\nEnabling factors:\n\nInvestment\nCommitment \n\nBarriers:\n\nSocial and ethical \nissues; Market \n\nacceptance and Cost\n\nEffects:\n- Global effects on public health\n- Bionano - technological improvement\n- Economics\n\nEffects:\n- Slow Incremental improvements in health care\n- Development of new environmental \nbionanocomposites and biomaterials\n\nTime\n \n\nFigure 1.9. Range of possible future trends and effects on bionanocomposites using lignocellulosic \n\ncomponents or nanofibers relevant for the biomedical field. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n44 \n\nA significant effort is under way to match the properties of the lignocellulosic materials with the ones \n\nrequired for specific applications. In the field of TE it is relevant to mention that research is evolving by \n\nimproving the mechanical resistance of the lignocellulosic-based constructs, namely, by applying \n\ndifferent types of nano-reinforcements, e.g. HA or the different CaP phases; although, there are other \n\nproperties that the materials should match, namely, biocompatibility, bioactivity, degradability (if a \n\nregenerative approach is targeted), among many others. \n\nAs it was pointed out in this review, materials with a hierarchical structure, such as wood, provide a \n\ndesign strategy within the development of biomaterials. This biomimetic approach exploits the micro to \n\nnanoscale organization of the wood porous structure to design nanostructured materials with enhanced \n\nmechanical, chemical and biological properties. Additionally, the alternation of fiber bundles and \n\nchannel-like porous areas also makes wood a material of choice to be used as a template in starting the \n\ndevelopment of new bone substitutes. In particular, some of the wood-derived structures were already \n\ntested as bioinert bone scaffolds [100, 213]. In this area more biological knowledge in terms of in vitro \n\nstudies will be required to understand the potential of these structures, as well as, more investment is \n\nneeded for the in vivo tests involving large animals.  \n\nThe current trend in the design of cellulose-based hydrogels is related to safety improvement issues, \n\nnamely in the development of non-toxic crosslinking agents/treatments. It is expected that the origin of \n\nthe lignocellulosic component will induce some differences in terms of swelling, chemistry, among \n\nothers. These variations influence the behavior of the biomaterial. In this field it is expected the \n\ndevelopment of new approaches for modifying and crosslinking hemicellulose and lignin in order to \n\nimprove the mechanical strength and adsorption capacity of their respective hydrogels.  \n\nThese new formulations are expected to present controllable physical properties that can be matched to \n\naddress the specific biological and medical challenges. These developments will allow the formulation \n\nof, for example, novel injectable materials for non-invasive surgical procedures, presenting suitability \n\nmechanical and biological properties. Hydrogels applied within TE should be capable to provide \n\nadequate mechanical properties, as well as the biochemical cues to promote tissue regeneration. The \n\nnanoscale structuring of these hydrogels, such as, pore size and controlled degradation rate must be \n\noptimized. In the future, the incorporation of modified functional hydrogels from plant-based polymers \n\ninto micro-devices will contribute to improve and provide new routes for fabricating enhanced TE based \n\nsystems with efficient in vivo performance. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future \n\ntrends for their use in the biomedical field \n\n \n\n45 \n\nIn drug delivery, the development of \u201csmart\u201d responsive bionanocomposites that can respond to \n\nchanges in their surrounding environments will provide for new and improved methods of delivering \n\nmolecules for therapeutic applications. The use of lignocellulosic components in drug-delivery systems \n\nis studied for several years [175, 218, 220, 278]. Additionally, the use of cellulose derivatives as \n\nexcipients in drug formulations is already a standard in the pharmaceutical industry [273]. In the future \n\nit is expectable the appearance of commercial formulations that are able to control the release rate and \n\ntimeframe of different drugs. These systems can be combined with biomedical devices typically used for \n\nbone and cartilage TE (e.g. bone cements). \n\nAs schematically presented in Figure 1.9, it will be necessary to attract the industry to this growing \n\nmarket opportunity capable of creating sustainable technological improvements in bionanocomposites. \n\nThe successful exploitation of these biomedical markets requires the commitment and interaction \n\nbetween industry and scientists. \n\nIt is expected a growing interest in the development of bionanocomposite structures based on \n\nlignocellulosic materials that target the biomedical field. The positive results obtained within the \n\nacademic activity with the proposed strategies to enhance the performance of the bionanocomposites \n\nwill contribute to sustain these market developments. In this sense, it is important to validate: the most \n\nsustainable supplies of lignocellulosic materials; and the origins that present a more stable composition, \n\nbetter properties and lower variability. In addition, it is also relevant to create mechanisms to conduct to \n\nthe certification of these nanostructured biomaterials according to common methods and standards. \n\n1.8 References \n\n[1] Sain M, Oksman K.

Along with Chapter I and to the introductions of each chapter, it aims to be a guideline of \n\nthe rationale for this research, namely on the aspects related with the selection of the materials, on the \n\nprocessing routes used, and characterization methodologies adopted. \n\n2.1 Materials \n\n2.1.1 Cork and cork by-products \n\nCork oak produces three qualities of suberose tissue: \u201cvirgin cork\u201d, \u201csecundaria\u201d and \u201creproduction \n\ncork\u201d, corresponding to the first, second and subsequent debarks [1]. The first cork is used only for \n\nagglomerates, the second can be used to extract stoppers but with high production of disposals, the \n\nthird and subsequent extractions produce regular cork tissue which is proper for stopper fabrication [2-\n\n4].  Industrial transformation of cork generates up to 25 wt.% of cork dust as by-product [2]. Figure 2.1, \n\nshows the four classes of cork-by products used in this thesis. It was used \u201camadia\u201d cork in the powder \n\nand granulated cork. Moreover, different cork by-products obtained from the industrial cork process \n\nwere also studied and the principal characteristics are provide below. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1. Cork oak tree and visual aspect of the different cork by-products resulting from the industrial \n\nprocess. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n70 \n\n \n\n? Cork \n\nThe materials used in the thesis were cork granules, with an average particle size 0.5-1 mm and \n\nspecific weight of 166 \u00b1 21 kg.m-3, moisture content of ~7.5 % and a cork powder, with an average \n\nparticle size &lt;500 \u00b5m, a specific weight of 157 \u00b1 2 kg.m-3 and moisture content of ~5.4% were both \n\nsupplied by Amorim Revestimentos S.A. (S. Paio Oleiros, Portugal).  \n\n \n\n? Cork by-products \n\nIt was collected different cork powders obtained from the industrial cork process as a by-products being \n\nthe qualities designed by grinding powder,  sanding/external powder, Corkstyle\u00ae powder and floating \n\npowder provide from Amorim Revestimentos, S.A. (Portugal). These powders are present in Figure 2.1 \n\nand a small description of the principal characteristics is providing below. Since the sanding powder \n\nand the external powder are very similar, a mixture of the referred powders was used in the present \n\nthesis. \n\n \n\nGrinding powder was the one with higher specific weight. This powder is characterized by presenting a \n\ndark brown colour due to the fact that it consists mainly of the outer bark, denser and very similar to \n\nwood. Moreover, this powder presents contaminations with silica from the sandpaper, resins, varnish \n\nand paint pigments due to the incorporation of materials for recycling. This waste was also the one with \n\nthe highest moisture content. \n\nSanding/external powder is the powder with lowest specific weight and lower range of particle size. This \n\nkind of powder is mainly composed of cork particles of good quality and low density that can be \n\nobtained from the cork stopper waste. It may also present some contaminations with resins from the \n\nagglomeration glues and glue from the decorative process and some silica from the sandpaper but in \n\nvery low amounts.  \n\nCorkstyle\u00ae powder is composed of high density fibreboard (HDF) formed during the machining process \n\nof the dock and cork, with a greater amount of HDF powder. The density is very similar compared with \n\nthe floating powder. \n\nFloating powder consists of cork and HDF particles. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) particles are also presents \n\nin small amounts. Some varnish, paint pigments, resin and sinter bonding motifs may be present. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n71 \n\n2.1.2 Natural fibre boards \n\nCommercial well established underlayment materials used in this work such as, medium density \n\nfibreboard (MDF) and high density fibreboard (HDF) with 6 mm of thickness from Sonae Industria, were \n\nused as control to compare the advantages and disadvantages with the developed cork-polymer (50-50) \n\nwt.% composites. \n\nMDF (brown) and HDF (green) is a dry-formed panel product manufactured from lignocellulosic fibres \n\ncombined with a synthetic resin such as urea formaldehyde resin (UF), phenol formaldehyde resin (PF) \n\nor isocyanate binder under heat and pressure in the presence of moisture [5]. Formaldehyde is an \n\norganic compound and is part of the aldehyde family and is part of the volatile organic compound (VOC) \n\nfamily. The main source of formaldehyde inside of buildings is in wood agglomerates, used frequently \n\nas a construction material and in furniture. All these agglomerates containing formaldehyde are subject \n\nto European standards (EN 120, EN 312-1, EN 662-1) which aim to regulate and control the maximum \n\nconcentration of formaldehyde. \n\n2.1.3 Natural fibres \n\nBiofibres offer several advantages over the traditional ones, the most important are low density and low \n\ncost, good specific strength properties, nonabrasive during processing, CO2 neutral when burned and \n\nbiodegradability [6-8]. The most efficient natural fibres have been considered those that have high \n\ncellulose content coupled with a low microfibrile angle, resulting in high mechanical properties of the \n\nfibre [8]. Depending of the natural origin there are six basic types of natural fibers. They are classified \n\nas follows: bast fibers (jute, flax, hemp, ramie and kenaf), leaf fibers (abaca, sisal and pineapple), seed \n\nfibers (coir, cotton and kapok), core fibers (kenaf, hemp and jute), grass and reed fibers (wheat, corn \n\nand rice) and all other types (wood and roots) [9]. \n\nIn this thesis it was used coconut fibre (coir) from fruit and sisal from leaf origin. Moreover, it was also \n\ntest short wood fibre and the results are reported in the appendix section, regarding the patent of the \n\nreinforce cork-polymer composites with natural fibres. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n72 \n\n2.1.3.1 Sisal fibre \n\nSisal is a hard fibre is obtained from the leaves of an annually harvested plant, called Agave sisalana \n\nand is commercially produced in Brazil and East Africa [9, 10]. Chemically sisal is mainly composed by \n\n65 wt.% of cellulose, 12 wt.% of hemicellulose, 9.9 wt.% of lignin and 2 wt.% of waxes [9]. Sisal fibre is \n\none of the most widely used natural fibres and accounts for almost half the total production of natural \n\nfibres [11]. The hydroxyl groups which occur throughout the structure of natural fibres make them \n\nhydrophilic, but many polymer matrices are hydrophobic so that natural fibre-polymer composites have \n\npoor interfaces. Moreover, the hydrophilic sisal fibres absorb a large amount of water in the composite \n\nleading to failure by delamination. Adequate adhesion across the interface can be achieved at desirable \n\nlevels by better wetting and chemical bonding between fibre and matrix [7, 10, 11]. To improve fibre-\n\nmatrix adhesion chemical treatment of sisal fibre was employed and will be further indicated. The sisal \n\nfibre used in the thesis was from Madagascar, presents a diameter of 183 \u00b1 35 ?m and moisture \n\ncontent of ~11.3 %. The samples were randomly and gently isolated from the fibre bundles. All isolated \n\nfibres were re-conditioned at 20-22\u00baC and 60% relative humidity before use. \n\n2.1.3.2 Coconut fibre \n\nCoir is a hard fiber found between the hard inner shell and the outer coat of coconuts, which grow \n\nextensively in tropic and subtropic regions of the world [7]. Chemically coir is mainly composed by 32 to \n\n43 wt.% of cellulose, 0.15 to 0.25 wt.% of hemicellulose and 40 to 45 wt.% of lignin [9]. Coir is a cheap \n\nfiber, even cheaper than sisal [11, 12]. Coir as natural reinforcing in polymeric matrices presents \n\ninferior performance due to several factors such as its low cellulose content, high lignin content, high \n\nmicrofibrillar angle and large variable diameter [11]. There are two types of coir, a white fiber derived \n\nfrom harvesting coconuts before they are ripe, and a coarser brown fiber derived from harvesting \n\ncoconuts after they have ripened. Between the two, coir fiber production worldwide is calculated to be \n\nroughly 250,000 tons. While the fiber is considered a poor reinforcing fibre because of its low strength \n\nand modulus, it has found interest due to its low density, low thermal conductivity and high elongation \n\n[7]. The brown coconut fibre used in the work was from Hayleys Exports PLC (Kotugoda, Sr\u00ed Lanka) \n\npresented a diameter of 277.4 \u00b1 38.8 \u00b5m, a humidity of 8.2 % and specific weight of 845.1 \u00b1 46.6 Kg \n\nm-3, was collected at Amorim Isolamentos S.A. (Vendas Novas, Portugal). The samples were randomly \n\nand gently isolated from the fibre bundles. All isolated fibres were re-conditioned at 20-22\u00baC and 60% \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n73 \n\nrelative humidity before use. No pre cleaning treatment was used to the fibres (e.g. soaked in distilled \n\nwater for a period of time under a normal indoor environment). \n\n2.1.4 Polyolefins \n\nPolyolefins like polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) are two of the most commonly used polymers \n\nwith wide range of applications. They are normally defined as polymers based on alkene-1 monomers \n\nor ?-olefins, and are the most widely used group of thermoplastic polymers today. Based on their \n\nmonomeric units and their chain structures, they can be divided into the following subgroups [13]: \n\nEthylene-based materials \u2013 polyethylenes (PEs) \u2013 produced under low pressure conditions with \n\ntransition metal catalysts of various types and showing a predominantly linear chain structure. This \n\nsubgroup includes high density PE (HDPE), medium density PE (MDPE), linear-low density PE (LLDPE) \n\nand other varieties, which are distinguished through the regulation of density and subsequently \n\nmechanical properties through the incorporation of higher ?-olefins (mostly butene, hexene and octene) \n\nas comonomers.  \n\nAnother subgroup is the propylene-based polymers produced with transition-metal catalysts - \n\npolypropylene (PP) and its copolymers - showing a linear chain structure with stereospecific \n\narrangement of the propylene units. A wide variation of material properties can be achieved with the \n\nincorporation of ethylene and/or higher ?-olefins in various fashions; single-phase and multiphase \n\nmaterials are possible.Table 2.1 presents the repeat structure and principal properties of both selected \n\npolyolefins used in the thesis. \n\n \n\nTable 2.1.

Polymerization at high pressure \n\nleads to branched chains and the polymer has a low density 0.915 \u2013 0.935 g.cm-3 with cristallinity \n\nbetween 40% and 50%. On the other hand, when ethylene is polymerized at low pressure, the chain \n\nbranching is eliminated. The resulting material has a crystallinity of 60% - 80% and a density of 0.95 \u2013 \n\n0.965 g.cm-3 [16]. The density and modulus of polyethylene increase with crystallinity. The repeat \n\nstructure of PE is written as (\u2013 CH2CH2 \u2013)n, and is shown in Table 2.1. Properties of PE depend on: \n\nmolecular weight, molecular weight distribution, as well as on the degree and type of branching [17]. \n\nPolyethylene, like, polypropylene, has many good properties, which make it a material of choice for a \n\nnumber of applications  and owing to this reason, the composites of polyethylene are continuously \n\nstudied to expand the number of applications. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) exhibits good thermal \n\nstability, water vapour barrier (nonpolar), low glass transition temperature and high crystallinity, which \n\nmake it suitable for instance in packaging frozen foods. Moreover is not is not attacked by most acids, \n\nbases, or solvents [16]. Since HDPE is relatively inert it is difficult to achieve good interfacial adhesion \n\nin composites. Often maleic anhydride grafted polyethylene is added to HDPE to improve interfacial \n\nadhesion to the reinforcing fibres [18]. In this thesis, it was used a high density polyethylene (HMA \u2013 \n\n025), HDPE, with a MFI of 8.2 g.10min-1 (190 \u00baC, 2.16 kg), supplied by ExxonMobil\u2122 (Germany). The \n\nmelt flow index was carried out according to ISO 1133 [19]. \n\n2.1.4.2 Polypropylene (PP) \n\nPolypropylene is a linear hydrocarbon and the presence of a methyl group attached to alternate carbon \n\natoms on the chain backbone can alter the properties of PP (see Table 2.1) as compared with the PE in \n\ndifferent ways. The first effect leads to an increase in the crystalline melting point. Some aspects of \n\nchemical behaviour are also affected by the methyl group, for instance the ternary carbon atom \n\nprovides a site for oxidation causing PP to be less stable than PE to the influence of oxygen. The most \n\nsignificant influence of the methyl group is its generation of different tacticity in the products, ranging \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n75 \n\nfrom the completely isotactic and syndiotactic structures to atactic molecules. The properties of the \n\npolymer depend on the size and type of crystal structure formed, which in turn is dependent on the size \n\nand type of crystal growth. The ratio of these two rates can be controlled by varying the rate of cooling \n\nand by incorporation of nucleating agents. In general, the smaller the crystal structures, the greater the \n\ntransparency and flex resistance and lesser rigidity and heat resistance. PP has a number of \n\nadvantages, such as low density (0.90 g.cm-3) and low cost. It has a higher softening point and hence a \n\nmaximum service temperature and dimensional stability [16]. Moreover and since polypropylene is \n\nnonpolar, it absorbs very little water. Due to its Tg below room temperature, it exhibits good impact \n\nstrength [18]. In this thesis, it was selected a polypropylene homopolymer (1374 E2), PP, with a MFI of \n\n20.8 g.10min-1 (200 \u00baC, 2.16 kg), supplied by Exxon Mobil (Germany). The melt flow index was carried \n\nout according to ISO 1133 [19]. \n\n2.1.4.3 Recycled polymer \n\nRecycled and waste thermoplastics are some of the major components of global municipal solid waste \n\n(MSW) and they present a promising raw material source for lignocellulosic composites, especially \n\nbecause of the large volume and low cost of these materials [20]. High density polyethylene (HDPE), \n\nlow density polyethylene (LDPE/LLDPE), polypropylene (PP), Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), \n\npolystyrene (PS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are the primary constituents of plastics in MSW. Reutilizing \n\nthe post-consumed polymeric materials reduces the environmental impact and the consumption of \n\nvirgin plastics [21]. In this thesis, a mixture of recycled polyolefins in the grinding form with a MFI of 2.4 \n\ng.10min-1 (190 \u00baC, 2.16 kg), provided by Pallmann Maschinenfabrik GmbH &amp; Co., Germany was used \n\nfor the preparation of cork-polymer composites. \n\n2.1.5 Bio-based aliphatic polyesters \n\nThermoplastics are having more environmental impact than thermosets because of its recyclability. \n\nContributing to develop higher sustainable materials, bio-based products obtained from renewable \n\nresources maintain carbon dioxide neutrally [12]. Figure 2.2 shows the classification of the \n\nbiodegradable polymers dived in four families and used in this work, adapted from Averous L. and \n\nBoquillon N. [22]. The family 1 to 3 are obtained from renewable resources. The first family is agro-\n\npolymers (e.g. polysaccharides such as starch and cellulose) obtained from biomass by fraction.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n76 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2. Classification of biodegradable polymers and their nomenclature (adapted from Averous L \n\nand Boquillon N.

The fourth family are polyesters, totally synthesized by \n\nthe petrochemical process (e.g. polycaprolactone, PCL) [22, 23]. The selected bio-based matrices, \n\nphysical properties and its chemical structure are presented in the Table 2.2: \n\n \n\nTable 2.2.

They are composed of chains of lactic acid that are produced by converting starch into sugar which \n\nis then fermented. By removal of water lactide is formed which is then converted into PLA resins \n\nthrough solvent-free polymerization [6]. PLA have been the focus of attention because they are \n\nproduced from renewable resources, they are biodegradable and compostable, and they have very low \n\nor no toxicity and high mechanical performance, comparable to those of commercial polymers [27]. \n\nHowever, the thermal stability of PLAs is generally not sufficiently high enough for them to be used as \n\nan alternative in many commercial polymers applications. PLA crystallinity, crystallization rate, \n\ntransparency and degradation rate of finished products can be regulated by the copolymerization of the \n\nselected L- to D-isomer ratios of lactic acid [24]. For instance, the PLA homopolymer such as such as \n\npoly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) is a hard, transparent and crystalline polymer having a melting point around \n\n170 \u00baC and a glass transition around 55 \u00baC [25]. PLLA attracts much attention as matrix in \n\nbiocomposites because of its easier processing and ecologically friendly nature [28]. Companies like \n\nCargill Dow are confident that PLA polymers will compete on a cost-performance basis with certain \n\npolymers, like polyethylene, polypropylene and polyester [6]. The PLA used in this thesis was a PLLA \n\nwith a L-lactide content of 99.6 % and a Mw of 69 000 g.mol-1, and was obtained from Cargill Dow LLC. \n\n2.1.5.2 Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) \n\nPolyhydroxyallanoates (PHAs) are produced directly from renewable resources by microbes [22, 24]. \n\nPolyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a biotechnologically produced polyester that constitutes a carbon reserve \n\nin a wide variety of bacteria and has attracted much attention as a biodegradable thermoplastic \n\npolyester [23]. It can be degraded to water and carbon dioxide under environmental conditions through \n\nnatural microbiological mineralization and has much potential for applications of environmental \n\ndegradable plastics [25, 29]. The PHB presents some disadvantages compared with conventional \n\nplastics, such as, brittleness and a narrow processability window. To improve these properties it was \n\ndeveloped the copolymer poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) that is highly crystalline \n\nwith melting point and glass transition temperature similar to polypropylene [6]. \n\nThe PHBV used in this thesis, presents 12% HV content and molecular weight (Mw) of approximately \n\n425 692 g.mol-1 was provided by PHB Industrial, Serrana, Brazil. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n78 \n\n2.1.5.3 Polyhy-?-caprolactone (PCL) \n\nPoly(?-caprolactone ) (PCL) is a petroleum-based linear polymer recognized as one of the few synthetic \n\npolymers that are completely biodegradable [24, 26]. PCL, is a partially crystalline linear polyester with \n\na low glass transition temperature of -60 \u00baC and a low melting temperature of 60 \u00baC. PCL is a tough \n\nand a semi-rigid material at room temperature having a modulus between those of low-density and high-\n\ndensity polyethylene [6]. Moreover, PCL has good water, oil, solvent, and chlorine resistance, low \n\nviscosity, and is easily processed thermally [24]. It has been shown that PCL is degraded by enzymes, \n\nlipases, secreted from microorganisms [6].  \n\nThe PCL used in this thesis was a PCL resin (commercially available as TONE\u00ae 787), with Mw of 125 \n\n000 g.mol-1, was obtained from Union Carbide Chemicals and Plastics Division, New Jersey, USA. \n\n2.1.5.4 Starch polyhy-?-caprolactone (SPCL) \n\nStarch is an expensive, annually renewable material from corn and other crops [24]. Starch converted \n\nto thermoplastic material (starch plastics) offers an interesting alternative for synthetic polymers where \n\nlong-term durability is not needed and fast degradation is an advantage [6]. Starches exhibits poor melt \n\nprocessability, are highly water soluble, difficult to process, brittle, and hence need a plasticizer to make \n\nthem suitable for engineering applications. Plasticizers such as water or glycols make starches flow and \n\nsuitable for thermoplastic processing [25]. Under the Mater-Bi trademark, Novamont of Italy today \n\nproduces four classes of biodegradable materials, all containing starch and differing in synthetic \n\ncomponents [6]. In this sense, blending starch with synthetic biodegradable constituents such as PCL \n\nmay also reduce the production cost [24]. The SPCL used in this thesis was a blend of corn starch with \n\nPCL 30/70 wt.% (SPCL) was supplied by Novamont, Italy. It contained about 63 wt.% of PCL, 27 wt.% of \n\ncorn starch and 10 wt.% of natural plasticizers. The Mw of PCL present in this blend is about 118 000 \n\ng.mol-1. \n\n2.1.6 Chemical treatments \n\n2.1.6.1 Coupling agents \n\nLignocellulosic composites using polyolefins (i.e. polyethylene and polypropylene) have gained \n\nincreasing interest over the past two decades, both in the scientific community and in industry [30]. The \n\nmain drawback with the use of natural based components such as natural fibres in polyolefin \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n79 \n\ncomposites is their hydrophilicity due to the high surface hydroxyl groups concentration which leads to \n\npoor interface and moisture resistance in composite materials [11].  The fibre\u2013matrix interaction can be \n\nimproved either via the fibre, usually by modifying its surface, or via the matrix, usually by employing \n\nadditives called coupling agents [30]. Coupling is a common method of chemical modification. A \n\ncoupling agent contains chemical groups which react with the fibre surface and the polymer matrix [7]. \n\nIn such case, the interfacial bonding between the two components results in enhanced mechanical \n\nproperties. Maleated polyolefins are the most widely used coupling agents [9, 31, 32]. They contain two \n\nfunctional domains: one a polyolefin typically high density polyethylene or polypropylene, which is able \n\nto form entanglements with the polymer matrix, and the second group, maleic anhydride, which is able \n\nto strongly interact with the fibre at extrusion temperatures, covalently (apparently), via hydrogen, or \n\nionic bonds [32]. A schematic representation of the reaction between the lignocellulosic material \n\nsurface and the coupling agent is provided in the Figure 2.3. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3. Representation of the interface reaction between the cork surface and the PE-g-MA (Adapted \n\nfrom Ara\u00fajo J.R. et al. [33]). \n\n \n\nBefore compound, special care should be taken into account that maleated polyolefins since they can \n\nslowly react with air moisture during storage, and form free acid. As a result, chemical reactivity of the \n\ncoupling agents decreases. Hence, it should be keep the maleated polyolefins dry, or heat them up \n\nbefore usage in order to regenerate the anhydride chemical structure [32]. In the composite formulation \n\ncontaining natural reinforcements or fillers, the maleated polyolefins are usually used at 1-5% by weight \n\n[32-35]. In the wood plastic composites the maleated coupling agent is the most expensive component \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n80 \n\nrepresenting 4-20% of the total cost of the materials in the formulation, while the plastic represents 60-\n\n80% of the formulation [32]. \n\nIn the work presented in this thesis, two different coupling agents based on maleic anhydride from \n\nExxonMobil, Germany were used, to improve the interfacial bonding between cork and matrix and \n\nimproved the mechanical properties of cork composites. The first coupling agent a HDPE functionalized \n\nwith maleic anhydride (PE-g-MA), containing 0.5 to1.0 wt% of maleic anhydride, was Exxelor PE 1040, \n\nwith MFI of 1.4 g.10min-1 (190 \u00baC, 2.16 kg), and a melting point of 131.3 \u00baC. The second one a PP \n\ngrafted with maleic anhydride (PP-g-MA), containing 0.5 to 1.0 wt% of maleic anhydride (Exxelor PO \n\n1020), with MFI of 110 g.10min-1 (190 \u00baC, 1.2 kg), and a melting point of 156 \u00baC. \n\n2.1.6.2 Extraction of suberin and lignin \n\nSuberin and lignin are the main chemical constituents from cork [2, 3]. Suberin is a natural biopolymer \n\ntypically found in the cell walls of plants [36]. The structure of suberin in cork is not yet fully understood. \n\nIt has been proposed that suberin consists of a polyester structure composed of long chain fatty acids, \n\nhydroxy fatty and phenolic acids, linked by ester groups [2, 37, 38]. Lignin is totally amorphous and \n\nhydrophobic in nature. It is the compound that gives rigidity to the plants. The main difficulty in lignin \n\nchemistry is that no method has been established by which it is possible to isolate lignin in its native \n\nstate from the fibre [23]. \n\nThe extraction of suberin and lignin from the cork powder was as follows: Extractive free cork powder \n\nwas obtained after three consecutive 6 h soxhlet extractions with dichloromethane, ethanol and water. \n\nThe resulting material was used to obtain the suberin and lignin fractions. Suberin extraction procedure \n\nwas adapted from Ekman R et al. [39] and Pinto PCRO et al. [40]. The product (1g to 13ml) was \n\nrefluxed in Ethanol:Water (25:1) containing 0.5M sodium hydroxide for a period of 6 h. After cooling, \n\nthe resulting mixture was filtered and the liquid fraction was acidified to pH 5-6 with hydrochloric acid. \n\nAfter filtration, the solvent was removed in a vacuum evaporator. The resulting solid residue was \n\nsuspended in water and extracted with 3 times the volume in chloroform. The organic fraction was \n\nrecovered and the solvent removed in a vacuum evaporator, resulting in a brownish paste-like material. \n\nThe methodology for lignin extraction was adapted from Ekman et al. [39] and Browning BL [41]. The \n\nsolid residue resulting from the suberin extraction was thoroughly washed with distilled water until \n\nneutral pH. 350 ml of a 72% sulfuric acid solution were added to 30 g of this residue and the mixture \n\nwas maintained under agitation for 2 hours at room temperature, followed by the addition of 550 ml of \n\ndistilled water and refluxing for 4 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the solid residue was \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n81 \n\nrecovered through filtration and washed with distilled water until neutral pH, a dark powdery material \n\nbeing obtained. \n\n2.1.6.3 Alkali treatment \n\nMercerization or alkali treatment with strong alkali bases was developed as a method for cotton fibre \n\nmodification by John Mercerin 1850 [30]. Is a usual method to produce high quality natural fibres, by \n\nremoving the natural and artificial impurities.  The chemical treatment reduces the fibre diameter and \n\nthereby increases the aspect ratio [8]. Mercerization is usually performed applying aqueous solutions of \n\nNaOH, at reaction times of 30 min up to 3 hr. As a result of alkali treatment (use of sodium hydroxide), \n\nthe following reaction (Equation 2.1) is presented [8]. \n\n \n\nFiber \u2013 OH + NaOH ? Fiber \u2013 O \u2013 Na+ + H2O   (2.1) \n\n \n\nTheoretically, other alkali types can be used as well, but sodium atoms have been shown to provide the \n\noptimal diameter for cellulose swelling, meaning that the treatment with NaOH is most efficient [42]. In \n\nany case, excess alkali has to be removed by washing the modified fibres/fillers subsequently, followed \n\nby a drying step [30]. The aspect of the long sisal fibre is presented in Figure 2.4 a) and the cut sisal \n\nfibre after alkali treatment in Figure 2.4 b). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4. Natural fibre used to reinforce cork-polymer composites: (a) sisal fibre; (b) sisal after alkali \n\ntreatment and (c) sisal cut fibre. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n82 \n\nIn this thesis, the preparation of alkali treated sisal (Sisal_NaOH) was as follows [43]: the sisal fibres \n\nwere immersed in sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution (5% w/v) for 2 h at room temperature. After that \n\nthe fibres were washed with distilled water containing a few drops of acetic acid. Final washings were \n\ncarried out with distilled water until neutrality (pH = 7), to remove the excess of NaOH present on the \n\nfibres, until this water no longer indicated any alkalinity reaction. Then, the fibres were air-dried at room \n\ntemperature, followed by drying in a vacuum oven at 70 \u00baC and after stabilise was stored in \n\npolyethylene bags for further characterization. \n\n2.2 Composites processing \n\nComposite material, is defined according to the standard ASTM D 3878 [44], as a substance consisting \n\nof two or more materials, insoluble in one another, which are combined to form a useful engineering \n\nmaterial possessing certain properties not possessed by the constituents [44]. Composites using \n\nnatural component such as the use of natural fibres to reinforce the polymeric matrix are manufactured \n\nusing traditional manufacturing techniques that includes compounding, mixing, extrusion, injection \n\nmoulding, compression moulding, and resin transfer moulding [9, 27]. In this work pultrusion, extrusion, \n\ninjection moulding and compression moulding processes were used to proof their successability for \n\nproducing cork-based composites and biocomposites with potential of application as sustainable \n\nproducts.  The production of natural fibre composites is strongly limited by the temperature and \n\nprocessing times begin seeing significant thermal degradation around 180 - 210 \u00baC, or over 175 \u00baC for \n\nlong periods with a significant decrease on the mechanical properties [7, 45]. Therefore, the processing \n\nof these composites must be limited to temperatures at the lower range of this degradation range and \n\nfor limited processing times avoiding significant fibre damage and reduced composite performance [7]. \n\nThe moisture content at a given relative humidity also can have a great effect on the biological \n\nperformance of a composite made from natural fibers [9]. The low moisture of cork can be regarded as \n\none of the advantages of cork to be selected as natural component in the composites, since is a \n\nhydrophobic material with low moisture content. \n\n2.2.1 Pultrusion \n\nPultrusion is an automated process to produce continuous, constant-cross-section composites [7]. \n\nLong-fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites granules are usually produced with the pultrusion \n\nprocess. At the exit of this system the cross-section of the strand is calibrated by a nozzle, then cooled \n\nand granulated [46]. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n83 \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 2.5. Pultrusion system used to compound the CPC pellets [47]. \n\n \n\nIn this work the different cork powders were mixed with the thermoplastics (in 50-50 wt% ratio) in the \n\ndry form and further compounded in an industrial pultrusion system (Palltruder PFV 250, Germany) as \n\nshown in Figure 2.5, to obtain cork-polymer composite pellets (Pallmann Maschinenfabrik GmbH &amp; Co., \n\nGermany). In this process the material mixture is equally plastified with frictional heat and pressure. \n\nResulting steam is vacuumed off. The pultruded material is pneumatically transported into a granulator \n\nwhich produces a homogeneous and uniform granule [47]. \n\n2.2.2 Twin-screw extrusion \n\nThe extrusion process is used by the plastic industry for the production of granules and also in the \n\ncontinuous production of semi-finished products or components. Single screw as well as twin-screw \n\nextruders that run either co- or counter-rotating may be used for this process. Single screw extruders \n\nare used when the mixing effect does not have to be very high. The excellent mixing effect of twin-screw \n\nextruder the natural fibre materials can be homogenously distributed and wetted in the polymer melt [9, \n\n46]. For instance, counter-rotating twin-screw extruders are mainly used in the processing of wood fibre \n\nreinforced thermoplastics (WPC), because the screws run in opposite directions, a secure material feed \n\nand a defined compacting of the material can be achieved [46]. The principal characteristics of both \n\nsystems to process natural fibre composite systems are compared in Table 2.3. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n84 \n\nTable 2.3.

In this thesis to produce cork-based \n\ncomposite pellets it was selected:  \n\n \n\n? Counter-rotating twin-screw extruder \n\nThis system was selected to produce cork-polymer composites materials with the highest cork content \n\n50 wt.% and 70 wt.% respectively. Moreover the hybrid cork-based composite pellets reinforced with \n\nnatural fibres were also compounding using this system due to the high complexity of the different \n\ncomponents (i.e. cork, natural fibres, thermoplastic polymer and coupling agent). \n\nIn both cases, prior to compounding, all natural raw materials were dried at 80 \u00baC during 24 h to \n\nstabilise the cork moisture content. These compositions were compound in a counter-rotating twin-\n\nscrew extrusion machine (Carvex, Portugal), which had a screw diameter of 52 mm and an L/D ratio of \n\n18 with a nonintermeshing, mixing mode screw configuration. The barrel temperature profile was in the \n\nrange 150 up to 190 \u00baC, and the screw speed was fixed at 30 rpm. The cork in the powder form and \n\nthe grinding selected matrix (i.e. polyethylene or polypropylene) were pre-mixed and manually feed in \n\nthe hopper system. No extrusion head was used in order to minimize the residence time and shear heat \n\ndissipation. The extruded material was cooled in air, granulated in a cutting mill to produce composite \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n85 \n\npellets. The pellets were stored in plastic bags and sealed and further conditioned at room temperature \n\nfor further investigation. \n\n \n\n? Co-rotating twin-screw extruder \n\nThe co-rotating twin-screw extruder system was selected to produce several varieties of cork-polymer \n\ncomposites pellets for different purposes, being: \n\n(a) To evaluate the effect of the cork addition to the polypropylene matrix, the effect of cork \n\ngranulometry and addition of coupling agent on the properties of the composites. In this case, the \n\ncompositions were compounded in a Leistriz LSM 30.34 intermeshing co-rotating twin-screw extruder \n\nwith a screw diameter of 33.7 mm and a length to diameter ratio L/D of 29, coupled to a die with a two \n\ncylindrical outputs with 4 mm diameter each. The extruder was equipped with two automatic volumetric \n\nfeeders, for the addition of grinding PP with or without coupling agent (i.e. volumetric (Moretto)) and the \n\nother for the cork in the granules or in the powder form (i.e. gravimetric (K-tron)) as shown in Figure \n\n2.6. Generally, the polyolefin and the coupling agent were tumble-mixed and fed through the hopper. In \n\nall the experiments it was used a vacuum pump system and the feed rate was set for 2 kg/h.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6. Extrusion of PP/cork composites using the extruder: (a) PP/Cork (70/30) wt.%; (b) extruder \n\ndie and (c) Leistriz LSM 30.34 twin-screw extruder (TSE) with the two feeders and the vacumm system. \n\n \n\nThe temperature presents a decreasing at the end of the profile since it is compensated by the \n\nincreased shearing which tends to increase the temperature of the composite. Part of the extrudate was \n\ncooled in water bath and subsequently ground by a Scheer (Germany) grinder in order to obtain pellets \n\nwith length ? 5 mm. The pellets were dried in an oven at 80 \u00baC and further packed and sealed in \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n86 \n\nplastic bags and conditioned at room temperature (23\u00baC, 55% relative humidity) at least for 48 hours \n\nprior to further investigation. \n\n \n\n(b) To evaluate the use of suberin and lignin as bio-based coupling agents through a reactive extrusion \n\nprocess. The extruder is an ideal reactor for polymer modification in that it serves as a pressure vessel \n\nequipped for intensive mixing, shear, control of temperature and residence time, venting of by-product \n\nand transport of molten polymer through the various sections of the extruder, each serving as a mini-\n\nreactor. It is an economically attractive process since the extrusion and the processing are done in a \n\nsingle stage and without chemical solvents emissions [49]. \n\nIn this case, and before compounding, the cork powder was pre-dried at 80 \u00baC in a vacuum oven until \n\nconstant weight. The raw materials, including the pulverized polyethylene, the benzoyl peroxide (BPO) \n\nand the coupling agent PE-g-MA, were pre-mixed. Compounding was performed in a prototype modular \n\nlaboratorial mini intermeshing co-rotating twin-screw extruder (TSE) as shown in Figure 2.7, with a \n\nscrew diameter of 13 mm, and a length to diameter ratio (L/D) = 27, coupled to a rod die with a \n\ndiameter of 3mm. The screw profile is built by sliding along a shaft conveying and kneading elements \n\nwith a maximum channel depth of 1.5 mm.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.7.

The pre-mixed \n\npolymer and cork were feed upstream by a miniaturized volumetric feeder (based on a Moretto DVM 18 \n\nL), together with the BPO initiator, or the PE-g-MA. Suberin and/or lignin were added as shown in Figure \n\n2.7 b) and c), by means of an automatic syringe pump (AL-1000, from WPI, USA), or manually, \n\nrespectively. After air-cooling, part of the extruded composite was pelletized. \n\n \n\n(c) To produce biocomposite pellets with cork. \n\nThe raw materials were pre-mixed and then were compounded in a Rondol SCF modular co-rotating \n\ntwin-screw extruder (TSE) as shown in Figure 2.8, with the screws diameter of 16 mm, a length to \n\ndiameter ratio (L/D) = 25 and a single strand die of 3 mm.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.8.

Compression moulding \n\nmaterials combined with natural fibres are used in the automobile industry to produce car interior lining \n\nparts. The main reason for this application is the great strength and stiffness and the low composite \n\ndensity of the natural fibre composites [46].  \n\nIn this work, compression moulding process of the obtained dry pellets after pultrusion or twin-screw \n\nextrusion were processed using a hydraulic press from (Moore, UK) or (Carver, USA) to produce boards \n\nwith 3 and 6 mm of thickness from the different compositions (see Figure 2.9).  A certain amount of \n\npellets (approximately 70g) from each composition was collected and dispersed into a mold with a \n\nrectangular geometry (around 20x23cm2) and 3mm of thickness, containing on the top and on the \n\nbottom two removal covers.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.9. Compression moulding of cork-polymer composite: (a) The equipment used; (b) HDPE/Cork \n\n(50/50) wt.% board with 6mm thick and (c) Cork-polymer composite board after CNC process to obtain \n\nthe tensile specimens. \n\n \n\nBetween the pellets and the top and bottom mold walls it was used two Teflon sheets to allow the \n\nunmolding. This system was placed in a hydraulic press at a temperature between 150-170 \u00baC, \n\ndepending on the thermoplastic matrix (PE or PP) used to produce the pellets, for a period of 8min to \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n89 \n\nallow the melting and homogenization of the pellets mass, and further pressed during 2min at a \n\npressure of 11 ton followed by a cooling stage of 5 to 10min consisting on maintaining the pressure \n\nand using water to decrease the temperature aiming to decrease the temperature of the material inside \n\nthe mold near to the room temperature. Finally, the pressure was removed and the small contraction \n\nthat occurs on the board facilitates the unmolding of composite material. \n\nTo produce rectangular cork-polymer composite boards of 220?220?6 mm3 it was applied similar \n\nconditions of temperature and pressure were the period of time was extended to 9-10 min followed by a \n\nperiod of 4-5 min under pressure before cooling and perform the mould release. Tensile bars in dog \n\nbone shape were obtained from these boards of 3mm thick using a computer numerical control CNC \n\nmachine (Roland 3D Plotter MDX-20, UK). The specimens were produced according to ISO 527\u20132 [50, \n\n51] and similar standard ASTM D 638 [52] as shown in Figure 2.9 c). \n\n2.2.4 Injection moulding \n\nIt is possible to produce complex geometric components with functional elements fast and also in high \n\nvolumes by this process [46].  Injection moulding is a major plastic forming process in which the \n\ncomponents to obtain the final material passes through five stages: (1) mould closing, (2) filling, (3) \n\npacking\u2013holding, (4) cooling and (5) mould opening are preceded repeatedly. The industry mostly \n\nadopted injection moulding for plastic processing since, as a cyclic process, it has rapid production rate \n\non complex shape product with good dimensional accuracy and surface finishing [53]. It is a high-\n\npressure process with machine capital costs and tooling costs generally high compared to other \n\ncomposites processing routes. However, these costs can be recovered through inherent short cycle \n\ntimes, automation, and low labour costs [54]. \n\nPrior to injection moulding, the produced pellets were dried in a vacuum oven at 50 \u00baC until stabilize. It \n\nwas used two different injection moulding machines to produce the tensile specimens as presented in \n\nFigure 2.10. The polypropylene and the PP/cork composite pellets were injection moulded in an ENGEL \n\nSpex Victory 50 (Austria GmbH) with 500 kN of clamping force.  \n\nThe neat polymers and the biobased composite pellets were injection moulded in a Ferromatik-Milacron \n\nK85 (Germany) with 850 kN of clamping force. The mould temperature was controlled through a \n\nthermal regulator Piovan THN 6P (Piovan, Italy). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n90 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.10. Injection moulded process: (a) ENGEL Spex Victory 50 unit [55]; (b) Ferromatik-Milacron \n\nK85 unit and (c) specimens of SPCL and respective biocomposite SPCL/Cork (70/30) wt.% tensile \n\nspecimens. \n\n \n\nIn Both cases, the injection-moulded specimens were tensile bars produced according ASTM 638, with \n\n60 mm length, a constant rectangular cross-section of 2\u00d74 mm2, and a neck length of 20 mm. The \n\nsamples were placed in polyethylene plastic bags and conditioned at ambient temperature. \n\n2.3 Characterization methods \n\n2.3.1 Physical properties \n\n2.3.1.1 Density of cork and cork composites \n\n? Cork \n\nThe bulk density of the different cork powders was determined using a volumetric flask of 500ml were it \n\nwas placed and compacted the material to minimise the possible empty spaces between the particles.  \n\n      (2.2) \n\n \n\nThe equation 2.2 was applied for density calculations were, d is the specific weight (Kg/m3) of the cork \n\nraw material, m is the weight of the compact cork powder and v is the volume occupied by the cork \n\npowder into the volumetric flask. Three measurements were performed for each cork powder. \n\n \n\n? Cork Composites \n\nThe density of the natural fibres and of the different composite specimens was determined according to \n\nthe standard ASTM D 792 [56], using an analytical balance equipped with a stationary support for the \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n91 \n\nimmersion vessel. Five specimens were weighted per each sample. It was used Propanol as immersion \n\nliquid and it was used the following equation: \n\n \n\n   (2.3) \n\n \n\nwhere ? is the specific gravity of the solid (g/cm3), G the Buoyancy of the plummet; ? (liq) is the density \n\nof the liquid and ? (liq. propanol) was 0,7982 g/cm3 (being the experimental value). The density of the \n\nnatural fibres (i.e. coir and sisal) was also determined using this method. Due to the reduced weight of \n\na single fibre it was used a small number of fibres to determine the fibre density per condition. \n\n2.3.1.2 Fibre diameter \n\nNatural fibres are quite different from the synthetic fibres. Natural fibres often consists of a bundle of \n\nelementary fibres, which results in an irregular shape depending on the number of elementary fibres \n\nand the way by which they are packed together [57].  \n\nFigure 2.11 reveal a typical optical microscopic (OM) image of the morphology, showing the polished \n\ncross-section of a cork-polymer composite reinforced with the sisal after alkali treatment. The cross-\n\nsection shows elementary fibres and we observed that is not perfectly round. Furthermore, the natural \n\nfibers also can present a hollow structure, called lumen, which looks like a small open channel in the \n\ncentre of the cell and maybe affect the actual fibre area under a mechanical loading. Thus, the \n\ndiameter observed under OM can vary a lot depending on the view it is observed. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.11. Optical image of a polished cork-polymer composite cross-section reinforced with sisal \n\nfibre after alkali treatment. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n92 \n\n \n\nSince natural fibres presents irregular shape and are non-uniform along the fibre axis, it is difficult to \n\nobtain a good focus on the fibre image under OM to determine the fibre diameter. As shown in Figure \n\n2.12, it is not easy to achieve a good focus of such stack of elementary fibre bundle. \n\nTherefore, it is not surprised that this method often results in an inaccurate value of tensile strength \n\nwith very high SD value for the natural fibres. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.12. Partial view of the software used to determine the fibre diameter. \n\n \n\nIn this sense, and to reduce the variability of the experimental values, the diameter measurements of \n\nnatural fibres were made in five spaced locations along the gauge length of 30 different specimens \n\nusing an optical microscope Olympus BH-2 (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an Olympus DP11, (Japan) \n\ndigital camera. The measurements were performed used a software Leica Qwin Pro and a partial view \n\nof the program is shown in Figure 2.12, representing a sisal fibre. \n\n2.3.1.3 Moisture content \n\nThe percentage of humidity of the different cork powders, or in the natural fibres was determined using \n\na balance Sartorius (Sartorius AG, Germany) were the cork powder or the fibres were submitted to 105 \n\n\u00baC during a period of 10min. This procedure was performed three times for each cork powder sample. \n\nThe moisture content of the composite specimens was calculated as follows: \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n93 \n\n   (2.4) \n\n \n\nwhere Ww is the weight of the specimen before drying (g) and Wd is the weight of the sample after drying \n\n(g). Averages of five specimens were used for WA and MC measurements. \n\n2.3.1.4 Water absorption \n\nAiming to study the dimensional stability of the developed cork composites the water absorption tests \n\nwere conducted according the ASTM D 570 [58]. \n\nTo determine the water absorption, specimens (measuring 6mm in thickness, 60mm wide and 90 mm \n\nlong) from the different materials were immersed in distilled water, at 23 \u00b1 1 \u00baC and atmospheric \n\npressure, for different time periods (up to 11 days). In the end of each time period, five specimens of \n\neach material were removed, gently blotted with tissue paper to remove the excess water on the surface \n\nand immediately weighed. The water absorption was calculated according to the equation (2.5): \n\n \n\n100(%) ?\n?\n\n?\nb\n\nba\n\nW\n\nWW\nabsorptionWater\n\n   (2.5) \n\n \n\nwhere Wa = weight of the specimen after being immersed for a certain period of time and Wb = weight of \n\nthe same specimen before immersion (g). \n\n \n\n2.3.1.5 Weight loss \n\nThe weight loss (WL) of the developed specimens was calculated as follows: \n\n \n\n   (2.6) \n\n \n\nwhere Wi is the initial weight of the specimen (g) and Wd is the weight of the sample after drying (g). For \n\nthat purpose, the specimens were weighed using an analytical balance after being placed in a vacuum \n\noven at 40 \u00baC for 48 h, cooled and stabilized in a desiccator several days followed by reweighing of the \n\nspecimens. Averages of five specimens in each time point were used for WL measurements. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n94 \n\n2.3.1.6 Thickness swelling \n\nThe thickness swelling of the developed composite specimens was calculated as follows: \n\n \n\n100(%)\n1\n\n12 ?\n?\n\n?\nT\n\nTT\nswellingThickness\n\n   (2.7) \n\n \n\nwhere T2 = thickness of the specimen after immersion and T1 = thickness of the same specimen before \n\nimmersion. Moreover, the thickness of each immersed specimen was measured in two different points \n\nusing a digital micrometer Mitutoyo (Japan), with a precision of \u00b1 0.001 mm. Three to five specimens \n\nper each condition were measured. \n\n2.3.1.7 Soil degradation tests \n\nThe soil burial test can be considered a realistic approach to the biodegradation process in a waste \n\nlandfill. To demonstrate the potential of the biodegradable injection moulded matrices and the \n\nbiocomposite cork-polymer specimens (i.e. PLLA/Cork; PHBV/Cork, PCL/Cork and SPCL/Cork) were \n\nplaced in vessels of 5 L used as soil containers and buried in soil. The physical and chemical \n\ncomposition of the compost used, indicates an organic matter higher than 70%. The specimens were \n\nmonitored and removed at predetermined intervals of time test up to 4320 days. The average room \n\ntemperature was 19 \u2013 21 \u00baC and relative moisture was kept at least 50 % by pulverizing the soil with \n\ndistilled water and allowing continuous aeration. Once removed, samples were withdrawn carefully, \n\nplaced in small nets to avoid disintegration of the specimen and washed with distilled water. After that, \n\nthe samples where dried at 40 \u00baC in a vacuum oven to constant weight and kept in a desiccator, and \n\nthen measured in terms of thickness variation and weight loss before undergo to further \n\ncharacterization. It was used averages of 5 independent specimens in each time point per condition. \n\n2.3.1.8 Fibre crystallinity \n\nTo detect the crystalline structure of cellulose in sisal, Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXRD) \n\ndiffractograms were recorded using the Bruker-AXS D8 Discover diffractometer in ?\u20132? geometry using \n\nCu K?1,2 lines collimated with a Gob\u00ebl mirror, a divergent slit of 0.6 mm, a detector slit of 1 mm and \n\n0.6 mm and a Ni filter. The data was collected from 6-50\u00b0 with a step size of 0.04\u00b0 and an acquisition \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n95 \n\ntime of 1\u00ba sec per step. The percentage of crystallinity (%Cr), performed using a fitting program, was \n\ncalculated based on:  \n\n \n\n% Cr = (Acryst / Atotal) \u00d7 100   (2.8) \n\n \n\nwhere,  Acryst is the area below the diffraction peak of the  (002) plane, peak at 2?  = 22.5\u00ba, and from the \n\n(101) and (10 ) plane, peak at (13-18\u00ba), and Atotal is the area below the whole region representing the \n\namorphous material in the cellulosic fibres. \n\n2.3.1.9 Acoustic tests \n\nThe building elements for acoustic tests consisted on a superior element from CPC or fibreboard with \n\ndimensions of 220X220X6 mm3 and an agglomerated cork underlay with thickness of 1.8 mm thick as \n\nit is presented in Figure 2.13. Commercially available silicone glue (thickness of 0.5-0.6mm) was used \n\nto fix the agglomerated cork underlay to the previously produced boards (CPC, HDF and MDF boards) \n\n(Figure 2.13 a). The aim of including this agglomerated cork underlay was to avoid reverberation sound \n\nand fix the boards. The pavement was submitted to a uniformly distributed load (20 to 25 kg.m-2). The \n\ntests were conduct in a reverberant chamber with a 7.25 m length, 5.88 m width, 4.65 m height and a \n\nvolume of 202 m3 as presented in the scheme of Figure 2.14. The tests were conducted at atmospheric \n\nconditions 22 \u00baC and 66 % of humidity. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.13. Detail of the installation of composite boards in the reverberation room for acoustic \n\nmeasurement testing: (a) silicone application on the CPC board b) normalized tapping machine on the \n\nfloor system. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n96 \n\n \n\nThe equipment used for the measurements was a tapping machine Br\u00fcel &amp; Kjaer (B&amp;K, Germany) Type \n\n3204; B&amp;K 2260 dual channel real-time frequency analyser and B&amp;K 13 mm microphone model 4189. \n\nThe microphone height was about 1.4 m.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.14. Scheme of the acoustic test performed in the reverberation chamber. \n\n \n\nThe measurements of sound insulation were performed according the standard EN ISO 140-8 [59] and \n\n717-2 [60]. The measurements were taken at three locations of the tapping machine relative to the \n\nfloor sample area of 2 m2 and 5 positions of microphone with to different lectures using one-third-octave \n\nbands, 100 Hz to 4200 Hz. The reduction of impact noise by floor covering on standard floor was \n\ndetermined according the equation: \n\n \n\nnn\nLLL ???\n\n0,    (2.9) \n\n \n\nwhere, ?L  is the reduction of impact sound pressure level, Ln,0 is the normalized impact sound \n\npressure level in the absence of floor covering and Ln is the normalized impact sound pressure level \n\nwith floor covering. The impact sound improvement index (?Lw) was determined according to the \n\nstandard EN ISO 717-2 [60]. \n\n2.3.1.10 Warping \n\nWarping can result from an inferior product construction, wrong choice of materials or inadequate \n\nprocessing routes. Other reason that can cause this effect is the high moisture content in the air. After \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n97 \n\nprocessing, CPC boards (220?220?6 mm3) obtained by compression moulding were submitted to a \n\nspecific test to access the possible occurrence of warping effect. The obtained results were compared \n\nwith the commercial fibreboard composites cut with the same dimensions. In Figure 2.15 is shown a \n\nschematic illustration of the performed test. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.15. Scheme of the specimen\u2019s geometry with the measuring system for warping determination. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.15 shows the used system with a pointer p with precision capability of 0.01 mm of \n\ndisplacement. Two perpendicular measurements in each board were performed according the indicated \n\ndirections a and b. At least 15 boards (in dry state) of each condition were analysed to evaluate the \n\nwarping effect. \n\n2.3.1.11 Hardness \n\nTo infer eventual morphological variations of the cork-based composite materials and to characterize \n\nthe developed materials after compression moulding, it was attempted microhardness measurements. \n\nHowever, due to the small indentations on the composite surface and due to the recovery properties of \n\ncork, this test was not indicated. The hardness of the materials was determined by Shore-D Hardness \n\nTester (model bareiss \u2013 Pr\u00fcfger\u00e4te, Germany). The hardness test was performed according the \n\nstandard ASTM D 2240-05 [61]. This test method is based on the penetration of a specific type of \n\nindentor when forced into the material under specified conditions. It is recommended that Durometer D \n\ntests be used when Durometer A results are greater than 90 [61]. Ten measurements were performed \n\nper condition. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n98 \n\n2.3.2 Morphological properties \n\n2.3.2.1 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) \n\n? Morphology of the natural materials  \n\nThe different qualities of cork powder obtained from the industrial processing were analyzed using a \n\nQuanta 400 FEG model (FEI, USA) ambiental scanning electron microscope with low vacuum to avoid \n\nany possible desire effect in the natural raw material structure. Since the several cork powders presents \n\nlow dimension, the objective was to confirm that the vacuum effect does not affect the observation of \n\nthe cellular structure of the natural materials. \n\n \n\n? Morphology of the composites \n\nScanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) of the developed cork-polymer composites fracture surface was \n\nperformed using a Leica-Cambridge S-360 (UK) scanning electron microscope. All the samples were \n\nsputter-coated with gold before being analysed.  \n\n \n\nIn addition, it was also used for examine the microstructure of the cork-polymer phases, fracture \n\nsurfaces of the different specimens a NanoSEM 200 FEI (The Netherlands) scanning electron \n\nmicroscope (SEM). Before being analysed all the samples were coated by ion sputtering with an Au/Pd \n\nalloy (80-20 wt.%) in a high resolution sputter coater of Cressington 208HR (Watford, UK). \n\n2.3.2.2 Optical microscopy (OM) \n\nIn order to understand the nucleating ability of cork on the matrix, a single cork powder was \n\nsandwiched between two thin PP films and heated at 200\u00baC during 10min to erase the previous \n\nthermal history of the sample. Then, the sample was quickly shifted to a well-controlled temperature \n\nstage (Linkam, THMS-600) where the pre-determined crystallization temperature was maintained at \n\n140 \u00baC for 1h, to access to the crystallization process. A fast cooling was estimated to be 80\u00baC.min-1 \n\nwas used to reach the isothermal crystallization temperature. Dry nitrogen was introduced to eliminate \n\nany possible degradation in all cases. The crystallization of PP on the cork powder was observed on an \n\noptical microscope (Olympus B) connected to a Leica digital camera. \n\nIn addition, to observe the distribution of cork particles on the PP matrix, after injection moulding, was \n\nobserved on a transmission optical microscope (Olympus BH-2) connected to a Leica DFC 280 digital \n\ncamera and corresponding software. To prepare the samples for the analyses, one slice with a \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n99 \n\nthickness of 15 \u00b5m was cut, using a Leitz 1401 microtome equipped with a glass slicing knife, from the \n\nlongitudinal section of the tensile specimen as presented in Figure 2.16. The images were obtained \n\nfrom the middle section of the tensile specimen.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.16. Optical microscopy of a cross-section of a polypropylene/cork (70/30) wt.%: (a)  scheme \n\nof the tensile specimen revealing the longitudinal section; (b) image observed from the microscope in \n\nbright field and (c) image with color treatment to evidence the distribution of cork particles in the \n\npolypropylene matrix. \n\n \n\nEach sample slice was placed between a microscope glass slide and cover glass. To prevent them from \n\ncurling up or corrugating, Canada balsam was used as a fixing resin. Special care was taken during the \n\nanalysis to identify the cork particle distribution; the cork and the matrix domains as presented in Figure \n\n2.16 b) and c). All samples were left to cure under a simple weight pressure during at least 12 h prior \n\nto analysis. \n\n2.3.3 Chemical properties \n\n2.3.3.1 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) \n\nTo confirm the extraction of suberin and lignin extraction; the chemical groups attributed to the natural \n\nfibres including cork and to confirm the chemical modification in sisal, the fibres were analysed using \n\nFourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. All the spectra were acquired using a Shimadzu IR-\n\nPrestige 21. The attenuated total reflectance (ATR) methodology (PIKE Technologies) was used and the \n\nspectra were acquired between 4400 cm-1 to 800 cm-1 using a resolution of 4 cm-1. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n100 \n\n2.3.4 Mechanical properties \n\n2.3.4.1 Tensile properties of the composites \n\n? Tensile properties of the composites \n\nAll the tensile tests were conducted using a Universal tensile testing machine (Instron 4505 Universal \n\nMachine, USA) using a load cell of 1KN and a crosshead speed of 5mm min?1 was used up to a \n\ndeformation at break.  All the mechanical results were obtained with a minimum of five to ten tested \n\nspecimens.  The tensile tests were performed according the specifications of standard ISO 527 [50, 51] \n\nand ASTM 638 [52]. The test specimens were conditioned at 23 \u00b1 2\u00b0C and 50 \u00b1 5% relative humidity. \n\nThe specimens with dog bone shape were obtained by compression moulding or by injection moulding. \n\nThe specimen dimensions present 60 mm length, a constant rectangular cross-section of 2\u00d74 mm2, \n\nand a neck length of 20 mm. In the case of the compression moulded samples the thickness was \n\nslightly higher (3mm). In the tensile tests a force was taken as the maximum force in the force \n\ndeformation curve. Tensile modulus was estimated by extending the initial linear portion of the load-\n\nextension curve and dividing the difference in stress corresponding to segment of section on this \n\nstraight line by the corresponding difference in strain (average between 0.05% and 1%) using the linear \n\nregression method. According to the standard it can be also employed to determine the tensile modulus \n\nthe secant method. The maximum tensile strength was determined by dividing the load at break or \n\nmaximum load by the original minimum cross-sectional area.  The result is expressed in (MPa). The \n\npercent elongation at break is calculated by dividing the elongation at the moment of rupture by the \n\ninitial gauge length and multiplying by 100. Samples were conditioned at room temperature for at least \n\n48 h before testing.  \n\n \n\n? Tensile properties of the Single fibres \n\nAfter the observation and diameter measurement using optical microscopy, fibres with apparent defects \n\nwere removed in this process, since such defects are not representative for the fibre. Single fibre tensile \n\ntests were performed with a Instron 4505 Universal Machine, (USA) using a 1 kN load cell, a crosshead \n\nspeed of 1 mm min?1, and a fibre gauge length of 30 mm. Prior to testing, fibres were mounted on \n\nsturdy paper frames using a high-strength hot melt glue and placed in a desiccators for a minimum \n\nperiod of 48 h. The tensile properties of the single sisal fibres were determined according to the \n\nstandard ASTM C 1557 \u2013 03 [62]. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n101 \n\nThe observed fibres were temporarily fixed on the mounting card (see Figure 2.17) with thermal glue. \n\nThe testing was then carried out as follows: \n\n1) The prepared samples were subjected to optical microscopy to examine an accurate diameter \n\nof the test specimens. The diameter was measured in three different positions along the fibre \n\nand the mean values were used for data processing; \n\n2) The samples were tested in a universal tensile test with mechanical grips; \n\n3) Both sides of the card were cut in the middle before sating the test; \n\n4) The test specimens were tested at a crosshead speed of 1mm/min with  30 mm gauge length; \n\n5) The stress and strain of the loaded test specimens were tested automatically with Instron \n\nsoftware; \n\n6) Finally all the results (modulus, tensile strength and maximum deformation) were treated and \n\nrecalculated using Microsoft Excel.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.17. System used to test the natural fibres under tensile load. \n\n2.3.4.2 Flexural testing \n\nThree point static flexural tests were carried out using a Universal tensile testing machine (Instron 4505 \n\nUniversal Machine, USA) with a load cell of 1KN in accordance with standard ISO 178 [63]. The \n\ndimensions of the specimens used were 120 mm length, 15 mm width and 6 mm thick as presented in \n\nFigure 2.18. The load was placed midway between the supports with a span (L) of 80 mm. The \n\ncrosshead speed was 2.56 mm/min. For each condition, the specimens were loaded until the core \n\nbreak. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n102 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.18.

Based on the geometry \n\nof the flexural specimens according the standard ISO 178 [63] and reported in the Table 2.4, we \n\nselected the dimensions for the specimens from the case 2. \n\n \n\nTable 2.4.

The flexural strain (?f) in percentage was determined according: \n\n \n\n    (2.12) \n\n \n\nbeing, s the deflection in milimiters. The flexural modulus (Ef) expressed in megapascals, was \n\ndetermined using the following equation: \n\n \n\n    (2.13) \n\n \n\nBeing, ?f1 the flexural stress measured at the deflection S1 and ?f2 the flexural stress measured at the \n\ndeflection S2, both in megapascal. \n\n2.3.4.3 Impact testing \n\nThe Charpy impact tests were performed according the standard ISO 179-1 [64] and to ASTM 259-04 \n\n[65] on a Ceast Fractovis (Pianezza, Italy) instrumented falling weight impact tester with a pendulum \n\nenergy of 2 J. The Charpy V-Notched specimens were rectangular bars with 120 mm length, 12 mm \n\nwidth and 6 mm thick.  The V-Notched angle was 45\u00ba. The absorbed energy during the crack initiation \n\nprocess is given in kJ/m2. It was tested a minimum of seven specimens per condition. \n\n2.3.5 Statistical analysis \n\nAll results are provided as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). The values obtained by tensile and flexural \n\ntests of the cork-polymer composites obtained by pultrusion followed by compression moulding were \n\nanalysed in terms of the normality of the distribution of the mechanical results was evaluated using \n\nShapiro-WilK test to evaluate their normal distribution at p&lt;0.05. The results were compared using a \n\nTwo-Sample t-Test and differences were considered significantly different at p<0.05. \n\nRegarding the development of several injection moulded compositions of polypropylene with cork, the \n\neffect of cork loading, the coupling agent and in order to infer significant differences on the tensile \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n104 \n\nproperties before and after water immersion tests, the data were statistically analysed using IBM SPSS \n\nsoftware v. 23.0 (Release 23.0 for Windows). Firstly, a Shapiro-Wilk test was used to ascertain about \n\nthe data normality. The normality was rejected, since as observed by the p value (p &lt;0.05). Therefore, \n\nnonparametric tests were used in further comparisons. Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test was used to \n\ncompare the medians of the tensile modulus, tensile strength and maximum strain for the composite \n\nspecimens before and after immersion tests. Differences between groups were considered to be \n\nstatistically significant at a confidence level of 95.0 %. \n\nIn the development of hybrid cork-polymer composites containing coconut fibre one-way analysis of \n\nvariance (ANOVA) with post hoc Bonferroni multiple comparison tests was used to infer about \n\nsignificant differences between mean values of the mechanical properties in the developed cork \n\ncomposite materials. Assumptions of ANOVA such as normality were evaluated with Shapiro-Wilk test. A \n\nlevel of ? = 0.05 was used for statistical significance. \n\nIn addition, in the development of hybrid cork-polymer composites containing sisal fibre with and \n\nwithout coupling agents it was used Weibull to predict with more accuracy the tensile failure. In a first \n\nstage, the values obtained by tensile and flexural tests were analysed by the normality of the distribution \n\nof the mechanical results was evaluated using Shapiro-WilK test to evaluate their normal distribution at \n\np<0.05. The means were compared using a Two-Sample t-Test or the non-parametric Kolmogorov-\n\nSmirnov test and differences were considered significantly different at p<0.05 (*). Additionally and in \n\norder to predict the failure probability of the developed hybrid cork composites the values obtained from \n\nthe tensile tests were statistically analysed by using the two-parameter Weibull model, where the \n\ncumulative distribution function is given by the equation [66]: \n\n \n\n? ?\n?\n\n? ??\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n??\n\nx\n\nxF exp1  , for x ? 0   (2.20)  \n\n \n\nwhere F(x) is the probability of failure of a composite material subjected to a stress level x. In equation \n\n(2), ? and ? are two constants to be determined, known as the \u201cscale parameter\u201d or \u201ccharacteristic \n\nstrength\u201d and the \u201cshaper parameter\u201d, respectively. Finally the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S test) was \n\nemployed to evaluate the goodness-of-fit to the data points. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n105 \n\n2.3.6 Thermal properties \n\n2.3.6.1 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) \n\nThe TGA involves weighing a small volume and weight of sample and exposing it to a heated chamber \n\nin the presence of nitrogen. The sample is suspended on a sensitive balance that measures the weight \n\nloss of the sample as the system is heated. Nitrogen or another gas (e.g. air), flows around the sample \n\nto remove the pyrolysis or combustion products. Weight loss is recorded as a function of time and \n\ntemperature [67]. With the use of the computer software, the rate of weight loss as a function of time \n\nand temperature can also be measured. This is referred to as derivative thermogravimetric curve or \n\nDTG. \n\nTGA was performed to understand the degradation characteristics of the cork and the natural fibres to \n\ntest the thermal stability. In the case of sisal fibre was used to confirm the chemical modification. The \n\nthermal stability was determined using a TGA Q500 series thermogravimetric analyser (TA Instruments, \n\nUSA). Experiments were performed in platinum pans, at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C.min-1 from ambient \n\ntemperature to 600 \u00b0C in nitrogen or in air atmosphere. In each chapter similar weight and geometry \n\nsamples were tested. Analyses were performed in a minimum of two samples of each condition. \n\n2.3.6.2 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) \n\n? Cork-polymer composite materials \n\nDifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed in a TA instrument DSC Q100 \n\nmodel (USA) equipment and using samples of 8\u201312 mg. DSC was conducted at a heating rate of 10 \n\n\u00baC.min?1, under nitrogen atmosphere (flux of ca. 50 ml min?1). For all materials, the first scan is used for \n\neliminating the thermal history of the material. The glass transition temperature (Tg) and melting \n\ntemperature (Tm) are determined from the second heating scan. The crystallisation temperature (Tc) is \n\nobtained from the cooling scan because the samples are not quenched. Tg is determined at the mid-\n\npoint of heat capacity changes, Tm at the onset peak of the endothermic and Tc at the onset peak of the \n\nexothermic. Two or three samples for each composite material were tested. By integration of the \n\ncorresponding peaks, we have determined the different heats of melting and crystallization (?Hm and \n\n?Hc). These values (determined in J/g) can be corrected from a dilution effect linked to the fillers \n\nincorporation into the matrix e.g., see equation 2.14 where w is the cork fraction. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n106 \n\n   (2.14) \n\n \n\nThe degree of crystallinity was calculated on the basis of a 100% crystalline polymer according to the \n\nequation: \n\n \n\n   (2.15) \n\n \n\nwhere ?H\u00b4m is the apparent enthalpy of fusion per gram of polymer and w is the weight fraction of cork \n\nin the composite. All the analysis were repeated at least once. \n\n \n\n? Bio-based composite materials \n\nDifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements of the moulded specimens was assessed by \n\nDSC in a Perkin-Elmer, Pyris Diamond system at 20 \u00baC min-1 under nitrogen atmosphere. The DSC \n\nscans were performed in bulk specimens cut from the central part of the rectangular cross-section of \n\nthe tensile specimens. The glass transition temperature (Tg), cold-crystallization temperature (Tcc), \n\nmelting temperature (Tm) and total enthalpy (?H) of all injection moulded materials were identified. The \n\ndegree of crystallinity (?c) was calculated on the basis of a 100% crystalline a melting enthalpy of (?Hm\u00ba) \n\nof the used polymer and according to the equation: \n\n \n\n   (2.16) \n\n \n\nwhere ?Hrec is the enthalpy of recrystallization before melting; ?Hm the enthalpy of melting and w is the \n\nweight fraction of cork in the composite. All the samples were repeated at least once. \n\n2.3.6.3 Oxidation induction time (OIT) \n\nThe polymer is oxidizes in the atmosphere including Oxygen which deteriorates mechanical strength \n\nand electrical property. This decomposition by the oxidation starts from the low temperature than \n\ndecomposition in an inert gas. For instance in polyethylene, the oxidation decomposition starts below \n\nthan 200 \u00baC in the air to the contrary of the thermal decomposition from the vicinity of 400 \u00baC in the \n\nnitrogen atmosphere. For this reason, antioxidizing agents are employed to protect polyolefins such as \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n107 \n\nthe polyethylene [68]. To determine if the addition of cork contributes to some positive effect the \n\noxidation induction time (OIT) tests were concucted. OIT measurements were performed in a TA \n\ninstrument DSC Q100 model (USA) equipment. Indium was used as calibration. The samples were \n\nheated at a rate of 20 \u00baC.min-1 up to 200 \u00baC under nitrogen atmosphere. After 4 min at 200 \u00baC, the \n\natmosphere was changed to oxygen (both gases at flux 50 ml.min-1) and oxidation induction time was \n\nmeasured during the isothermal period. The analyses were performed in three samples per each \n\ncondition. \n\n2.3.6.4 Melt flow index (MFI) \n\nMelt Flow Index (MFI) also known as the Melt Flow Rate (MFR) is the output rate (flow) in grammes that \n\noccurs in 10 minutes through a standard die of 2.0955 mm diameter and 8.000 mm in length when a \n\nfixed pressure is applied to the melt via a piston and a load of total mass of 2.16 kg at a temperature of \n\n190\u00b0C (some polymers are measured at a higher temperature, some use different weights). The higher \n\na MFI, the more polymer flows under test conditions.  \n\nIn the present work a Daventest (England) was used for obtaining data and allow determining melt flow \n\nindex (MFI) of the neat polypropylene and of each composite material in the pellet form. Procedures \n\nwere performed according to ISO 1133 [19] and ASTM D1238 [69], using 210 \u00baC and 2.16 or 5 kg. \n\nEach condition was repeated once. For all the materials tested, the respective MFI was calculated \n\naccording to: \n\n \n\n    (2.17) \n\nIn equation 2.17, T is the temperature, L is the load, m is the average weight of the extruded material \n\nand t is the time interval selected for the test. \n\n2.3.6.5 Fire resistance tests \n\nIn designing building materials, fire resistance classification of the product is one of the most important \n\nfeatures. Single flame fire tests were carried out according to the standard ISO 11925-2 [70]. The \n\nsingle flame source test was performed in specimens with dimensions of 188 x 119 mm2 and 6 mm \n\nthick. The specimen was held vertically and a flame was applied from the bottom edge of the specimen \n\nbecoming more aggressive effect on the materials. According to the standard a burning time of 15 to \n\n20 seconds was applied and the burning dimensions after the test were registered. Three specimens \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n108 \n\nwere tested for each composite during a period of 20 seconds. A filter paper is placed beneath the \n\nspecimen holder to monitor the falling of flaming fragments as represented in Figure 2.19. The fire \n\nresistance classification was attributed according of the standard fire test of building materials EN ISO \n\n13501-1 [71]. \n\nThe classification for wall and ceiling products is based on the contribution to fire development the \n\nproducts will give in a scenario with a fire starting in a small room, by a single burning object. \n\nClassification for reaction to fire is in principle for products in their end-use application. The different \n\nclassifications can be described as follows [72]: \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.19. Scheme of the support type (a) presenting: 1) specimen holder; 2) specimen; 3) support; \n\n4) base of the burner from the Standard ISO 11925-2 [70]; (b) presents the experimental test in a MDF \n\nboard and (c) in a HDPE-Cork powder (50-50) wt.%. \n\n \n\nClass A1 products will not contribute to the fire growth or to the fully developed fire; \n\nClass A2 products will not significantly contribute to the fire growth and fire load in a fully developed \n\nfire; Class B products will not lead to a flashover situation, however they will contribute to the fully \n\ndeveloped fire; Class C products may lead to a flashover situation, but only in the second part of the \n\nreference scenario test, i.e. after more than 10 minutes; Class D products may lead to a flashover \n\nsituation, within the first part of the reference scenario test, i.e. within 10 minutes; Class E products \n\nmay quickly lead to a flashover situation, possibly within the first two minutes of the reference scenario \n\ntest; Class F no test is required. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n109 \n\nIn addition to the main classification for contribution to fire growth, additional classification parameters \n\nare assigned to a product, for smoke production and flaming droplets and particles. \n\n2.3.6.6 Thermal conductivity and thermal resistance \n\nThe aim of this section is to analyse the differences in thermal insulation of the developed cork-polymer \n\ncomposites and additionally compare their properties with commercial products such as MDF and HDF.  \n\n \n\nThe thermal conductivity and thermal resistance measurements were determined using the Fourier's \n\nLaw that expresses the conductive heat transfer as: \n\n \n\n   (2.18) \n\n \n\nIn equation 2.18, the amount of heat (Q) that passes through a certain sample area (A) in the time t is \n\ndirectly proportional to A, to the difference between the temperatures (T1 \u2013 T2) of the planes surfaces  of \n\nthe board and to time t and inversely to the thickness of the measured sample e [73]. K is the \n\ncoefficient of thermal conductivity that is measured in watts per meter kelvin (W/m.K). \n\n \n\nIn many construction materials are composed by several layers that are joint together by stitching or by \n\nfusion. In all cases, the way the individual layers are connected substantially affects the resulting \n\nthermal properties of the final construct. The total thermal resistance (Rt) is a thermal-property of a \n\nmaterial to resist the flow of heat and is given by the equation [74]: \n\n \n\n    (2.19) \n\n \n\nThis parameter, calculated from the total thickness h1 and the resulting thermal conductivity, cannot \n\nalways be considered as the algebraic sum of the thermic resistance of the individual layers. \n\n \n\nThe thermal conductivity (?) of the processed board materials with 2 and 6mm of thickness were \n\ndetermined using the Alambeta instrument. In the present test the equipment was calibrated to use the \n\nfollowing temperatures: T1 = temperature of the plane surface at 32 \u00baC and T2 = temperature of the \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n110 \n\nplane surface at 20 \u00baC. The sample thickness was automatically measured under constant pressure, \n\nwhich can be pre-set from 100 to 1000 Pa. \n\npoints. \n\n2.4 References \n\n[1] ISO/CD 633: Cork - Terms and definitions. 2004. \n\n[2] Silva SP, Sabino MA, Fernandes EM, Correlo VM, Boesel LF, Reis RL.

Usually these powders are burned and served to \n\nboilers in industrial processes. The main goal of this work is to transform this cork sub-product into a \n\nhighly value composite product. The real value is dependent on the mechanical performance of this \n\nproduct. Thus the mixture between cork and thermoplastics, particularly the improvement of interfacial \n\nbonding, is an important topic, which needs to be developed. The interfacial affinity can be greatly \n\nincreased, applying superficial modification of one of the components, or by the use of coupling agents. \n\nIn this work, a high amount of cork powder (50wt.%) from different origins combined with different \n\nthermoplastic materials using melt based processes has been examined. Pultrusion was used to \n\nproduce pellets and compression moulding to obtain boards to determine its properties. Coupling \n\nagents based on maleic anhydride (2wt.%) improved the tensile strength successfully, while the cork \n\npowder has an a important role in the stiffness. The morphology of the surface fractures indicated a \n\ngood dispersion of the cork and a good adhesion between both phases. Thermal properties of the \n\ncomposites disclosed a nucleating effect promoted by cork. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n2\n This chapter is based on the following publication: \n\nFernandes EM, Correlo VM, Chagas JA, Mano JF and Reis RL, 2010, Cork Based Composites using Polyolefin's as Matrix: \n\nMorphology and Mechanical Performance, Composites Science and Technology, 70: 2310-2318. \n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Cork based composites using polyolefins\u2019s as matrix: morphology and mechanical \n\nperformance \n\n \n\n119 \n\n3.1 Introduction \n\nCork is the outer bark of an oak tree known botanically as Quercus suber L. which is periodically \n\nextracted from the tree, usually every nine to twelve years, depending on the culture region [1-3]. Cork \n\npresents a homogeneous tissue of thin-walled cells, regularly arranged without intercellular space [3, 4]. \n\nThe cells are rectangular prisms, mostly pentagonal and hexagonal like a honeycomb structure (see \n\nFigure 3.1), with their axes along the tree\u2019s radial direction, stacked in columns [4, 5]. Like wood, cork \n\nis a lignocellulosic material were suberin an aliphatic polyester is the main chemical component of cork \n\ncell walls 30 - 50% [2, 6, 7] that is not present in wood cell walls. This anisotropic material has a unique \n\ncombination of properties, such as a high coefficient of friction [8], resilience, imperviousness to liquids \n\n(excellent sealing ability), low thermal conductivity, low density [1], high energy absorption, excellent \n\ninsulation properties, near-zero Poisson coefficient [9], fire resistant, among others, that makes it a \n\nadequate material for a variety of applications [3, 5, 10]. Every second, an area of rain forest \n\ncorresponding to 19 tennis courts is lost [11], where the cork-tree offers the advantage of remain the \n\nonly tree whose bark can regenerate itself after harvest, it is truly a renewable, environmentally friendly \n\nresource [2, 12].  \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 3.1. Cork morphology according a) radial direction and b) non-radial directions. \n\n \n\nThe most important sub-product provided from the different processes of cork industry is the cork \n\npowder, which possesses a high heating value, serving as raw material to feed the boilers in industrial \n\nprocesses [3, 13] but its commercial value is insignificant. There exist diverse types of cork powders \n\nthat present different features. The most important are: the grinding powder, from granulation or pre-\n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Cork based composites using polyolefins\u2019s as matrix: morphology and mechanical \n\nperformance \n\n \n\n120 \n\ngrinding; the cleaning powder, without impurities; the finishing powder from cut and sanding operations  \n\nor from cork disks and natural stoppers and finally the \u201cburning powder\u201d that comes from the mixture \n\nof these powders [13]. The degradation of cork is strongly dependent on temperature and mass losses \n\nbecome significant at 200 \u00baC [14] and the colour start to change to dark brown and at 300 \u00baC to black \n\n[15]. At lower temperatures 75 \u2013 85 \u00baC, only a phase transition was assigned to the melting of waxes \n\npresent in cork obtained by DSC that was corroborated by dielectric spectroscopy [16, 17].  \n\nThe aesthetical nature, the touch and the feeling of comfort promoted by the cork is also valued in \n\nseveral applications [18, 19] were its combination with other materials can improve their performance.  \n\nCork combined with polymers leads to composites with novel properties and presents a new field of \n\napplications that contributes for the sustainability of the forestry sector.  Cork-polymer composite (CPC) \n\nmaterials intend to combine the engineering properties of the thermoplastics with the unique described \n\nadvantages of this natural origin material trough appropriated melt based technologies in order to \n\ndevelop products with new shapes from theses that cork can provide for acoustic, thermal insulation, \n\nenergy absorbing or aesthetic applications. Earlier the industry saw in this natural material potential to \n\nbe used in melt based technologies like extrusion [20-22] or to create a wood substitute material [22].  \n\nIn a study performed by  Barlow and Ashby [23], cork powders were mixed with different binding agents \n\nwith a thermoplastic, a thermoset and a silicone rubber matrixes to create CPC. The mechanical \n\nperformance of the composites decreases with the increase of cork content. \n\nIn the last years there was an increasing interest on the CPC materials [24-27] for different uses. \n\nAnother study combines polypropylene with cork that was previously submitted to a surface \n\nmodification to improve cork-matrix adhesion, based on a water treatment at room temperature during \n\n1-3 h [28] and  more recently some applications are looking to the valorisation of the cork powders [29-\n\n31]. The improvement of interfacial bonding, between the cork and the matrix is a field that needs to be \n\nfurther developed, for example by using superficial modification of one of the components or by the use \n\nof coupling agents. In other polymeric composites based on wood several studies propose different \n\nstrategies to increase the interfacial adhesion  between the different composite phases[32, 33]. The use \n\nof these kinds of methodologies has been scarce in materials containing cork.  \n\n \n\nIn this study, cork powder with different qualities were mixed in high amounts (50wt.%), and were \n\ncompounded with thermoplastic materials in a pultrusion system to create CPC pellets. These pellets \n\nwere compressed moulded to obtain boards with a high dimensional stability. The effect of two coupling \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Cork based composites using polyolefins\u2019s as matrix: morphology and mechanical \n\nperformance \n\n \n\n121 \n\nagents based on a low percentage (2wt%) of maleic anhydride was analysed. The coupling agents were \n\napplied to promote adhesion between the cork-polyolefin phases, to improve tensile strength and the \n\ncork dispersion. \n\n3.2 Experimental section \n\n3.2.1 Cork materials \n\nSeveral cork powders, from cork processing stages were collected at the Amorim Revestimentos S.A. \n\n(Portugal) industrial facilities. All of them are cork based powders coming from the processing industries \n\nnamely, grinding powder, or sanding powder, external powder, cork style powder and floating powder, \n\nwith density raging from 157 to 400kg.m-3.  \n\nGrinding powder is mainly composed by the outer bark. This sub-product is characterized by having \n\nhigh density and dark brown colour (Figure 3.2), resembling the wood bark in its visual aspect. \n\nMoreover, this powder presents contaminations with silica from the sandpaper, resins, varnish and \n\npaint pigments due to the incorporation of materials for recycling.  \n\nSanding/external powder is mainly composed of cork particles of good quality and low density. It may \n\nalso present some contaminations with resins from the agglomeration glues and glue from the \n\ndecorative process and some silica from the sandpaper but in very low amounts.  \n\nCorkstyle\u00ae powder is composed of high density fibreboard (HDF) formed during the machining process \n\nof the dock and cork, with a greater amount of HDF powder. The density is very similar compared with \n\nthe floating powder.  \n\nFloating powder consists of cork and HDF particles. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) particles are also presents \n\nin small amounts. Some varnish, paint pigments, resin and sinter bonding motifs may be present. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Cork based composites using polyolefins\u2019s as matrix: morphology and mechanical \n\nperformance \n\n \n\n122 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2.

Both \n\npolymers were supplied by Exxon Mobil (Germany).  \n\nA mixture of recycled polyolefins in the grinding form with a MFI of 2.4 g 10min-1 (190 \u00baC, 2.16 kg), \n\nprovided by Pallmann Maschinenfabrik GmbH and Co., Germany was also used for the preparation of \n\ncomposites. All tests of melt flow index were carried out according to ISO 1133.  \n\nTwo different coupling agents based on maleic anhydride were used: 102 \u2013 1 K1 MDEX for \n\npolyethylene and Po 1020 K1 for polypropylene respectively, supplied by A. Schulman GmbH, Germany. \n\n3.2.3 Composites processing \n\nThe prepared compositions and processing conditions are summarized in Table 3.1. Before \n\ncompounding all raw materials were pre-dried at 70 \u00baC over night to stabilise the cork powders in terms \n\nof moisture content. \n\nThe different cork powders were mixed with the thermoplastics (in 50-50 wt.% ratio) in the dry form and \n\nfurther compounded in an industrial pultrusion system (Palltruder PFV 250, Germany) to obtain cork-\n\npolymer composite pellets (Pallmann Maschinenfabrik GmbH and Co., Germany).  \n\nIn a further step, compression moulding of the obtained pellets using a hydraulic press from (Moore, \n\nUK) was applied to produce boards with 3mm of thickness from the different compositions. The mould \n\ntemperature was around 150 \u2013 170 \u00baC depending on the thermoplastic matrix and the pressure was \n\n1.42 MPa.  \n\nTensile bars were obtained from these boards using a CNC machine (Roland 3D Plotter MDX-20, UK). \n\nThe specimens had a neck cross-section area of 3 mm \u00d7 4 mm and a gage length of 20mm. The \n\nspecimens were produced according ISO 527\u20132. Nevertheless, its thickness is slightly higher (3mm) \n\nthan the standard. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Cork based composites using polyolefins\u2019s as matrix: morphology and mechanical \n\nperformance \n\n \n\n124 \n\nTable 3.1.

Three measurements were performed for each cork powder. The \n\nspecific weight results and respective standard deviation are presented in Table 3.2. \n\n3.2.4.2 Pellets apparent density \n\nThe apparent density of the different composite pellets, obtained after pultusion, was determined using \n\nthe liquid displacement method based on the Archimedes principle. By this method, the volume of the \n\nsample is estimated by the mass of the volume that is displaced when the sample is submerged in a \n\nliquid. Thus, cork-polymer pellet samples weighting between 7 and 11g (the weight was determined \n\nwith a precision nearest to 0.0001g) were it was added distillate water to fulfil the empty spaces \n\nbetween the pellets. Special care was taken to avoid the presence of air bubbles. This procedure was \n\nperformed three times for each condition. \n\n3.2.4.3 Moisture \n\nThe percentage of humidity of the different cork powders was determined using a balance Sartorius \n\n(Sartorius AG, Germany) were the cork powder was submitted to 105 \u00baC during a period of 10min. This \n\nprocedure was performed three times for each cork powder sample and the results are presented in \n\nTable 3.2. \n\n3.2.5 Scanning electron microscopy \n\nThe morphological characterization of the developed cork-polymer composites fracture surface was \n\nperformed using a Leica-Cambridge S-360 (UK) scanning electron microscope. All the samples were \n\nsputter-coated with gold before being analysed. The cork powders were analysed using a Quanta 400 \n\nFEG model (FEI, USA) ambiental scanning electron microscope with low vacuum to avoid any possible \n\ndesire effect in the natural raw material structure. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Cork based composites using polyolefins\u2019s as matrix: morphology and mechanical \n\nperformance \n\n \n\n126 \n\n3.2.6 Thermal properties \n\nThe differential scanning calorimetric experiments were performed in a TA instrument DSC Q100 model \n\n(USA), using a refrigerated cooling system and nitrogen as a purge gas (flux gas of ca. 50 ml min?1). \n\nBoth temperature and heat flux were calibrated with Indium at a scanning rate of 10 \u00baCmin?1. The \n\nsamples were obtained by cutting a small piece of material (with 5 to 5.5 mg weight) in the central \n\nregion of the composite pellets parts. An effort was made to maintain the geometry of the different \n\nsamples, in order to keep the same thermal resistance. All the experiments were performed at 10 \n\n\u00baCmin?1, starting from room temperature. Only the second run was analyzed for melting temperature \n\n(Tm) and melting enthalpy (?Hm), which reflects the effect of the cork material contained in the \n\ncomposite avoiding the morphology effect developed during the processing. The crystallinity values of \n\nthe polymeric phase were determined from the cooling cycle using the following equation:  \n\n \n\nDegree of Crystallinity (%) = (?Hm /?Hm\u00b0) \u00d7100    (3.2) \n\n \n\nWhere, ?Hm is the melting enthalpy of the polymer and ?Hm\u00b0 is the enthalpy of 100 % crystalline PP \n\n(?Hm\u00b0 = 209 J/g) [34]. \n\n3.2.7 Optical microscopy \n\nTo understand the nucleating ability of cork on the matrix, a single cork powder was sandwiched \n\nbetween two thin PP films and heated at 200 \u00baC during 10 min to erase the previous thermal history of \n\nthe sample. Then, the sample was quickly shifted to a well-controlled temperature stage (Linkam, \n\nTHMS-600) where the pre-determined crystallization temperature was maintained at 140 \u00baC for 1 h, to \n\naccess to the crystallization process. A fast cooling was estimated to be 80 \u00baC min-1 was used to reach \n\nthe isothermal crystallization temperature. Dry nitrogen was introduced to eliminate any possible \n\ndegradation in all cases. The crystallization of PP on the cork powder was observed on an optical \n\nmicroscope (Olympus B) connected to a Leica digital camera. \n\n3.2.8 Mechanical properties and statistical analysis \n\nThe tensile properties were determined using a Universal tensile testing machine (Instron 4505 \n\nUniversal Machine, USA) using a load cell of 1 KN. The tensile force was taken as the maximum force \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Cork based composites using polyolefins\u2019s as matrix: morphology and mechanical \n\nperformance \n\n \n\n127 \n\nin the force deformation curve. Tensile modulus was estimated from the initial slope of the stress\u2013strain \n\ncurve (between 0.05% and 1% strain) using the linear regression method. Samples were conditioned at \n\nroom temperature for at least 48 h before testing. A crosshead speed of 5mm min?1 was used up to a \n\ndeformation at break. The average and standard deviations were determined using seven specimens. \n\nThe normality of the distribution of the mechanical results was evaluated using Shapiro-WilK test \n\nconfirming their normal distribution at p&lt;0.05. The results were compared using a two-sample t-test \n\nand differences were considered significantly different at p<0.05 (*). \n\n3.3 Results and Discussion \n\n3.3.1 Characterization of the cork powders \n\nThe different cork powders used on this study were physically and morphologically characterized before \n\ncompounding. The used powders and some of their characteristics are presented in Table 3.2 and in \n\nFigure 3.2. Since the sanding powder and the external powder are very similar, a mixture of the referred \n\npowders was used in the work. Of the analysed cork powders, the grinding powder was the one with \n\nhigher specific weight (409 \u00b1 6 kg m-3). This residual powder was also the one with the highest moisture \n\ncontent (18%) probably due to the presence of the wood present from the outer bark that is more \n\nhydrophilic than cork. \n\nThe sanding/external powder is the powder with lowest specific weight (157 \u00b1 2 kg m-3) and lower range \n\nof particle size distribution (60% of particle size less than 0.25mm). This material was also the one \n\npresenting the lowest humidity (around 5.4%). \n\nThe Corkstyle\u00ae powder and the floating powder presents a specific weight of 273 \u00b1 6 kg m-3 and 256 \u00b1 7 \n\nkg m-3 respectively. In terms of humidity the values are very similar and regarding the particle size \n\ndistribution, the floating powder has a higher content of small particles (around 58%) less than 0.25 \n\nmm. Table 3.2 also reports the humidity present in the different powders before the preparation of the \n\ncomposite materials. Since the cork sub-products tend to absorb moisture, all the natural raw materials \n\nwere pre-dried overnight in a vacuum oven to stabilize. The percentage of humidity present was around \n\n2.65 - 4.18%. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Cork based composites using polyolefins\u2019s as matrix: morphology and mechanical \n\nperformance \n\n \n\n128 \n\nTable 3.2.

At high magnifications the fracture surface of cork sanding powder with PP and \n\n2wt% of coupling agent (Figure 3.3 b) indicates good adhesion between both phases of the composite.  \n\nThe same behaviour was observe for the PE matrix (Figure 3.3 e and f); while the cork sanding powder \n\nmixture with the recycled polymers at a high magnifications (Figure 3.3 d) demonstrate some pull out of \n\nthe polymeric phase and some regions with gap between both phases. This may be due to the lower \n\nmechanical properties of this matrix since is a mixture of different grade of recycled plastics that could \n\ncontain some impurities and due to the absence of coupling agent to improve the interface bonding. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Cork based composites using polyolefins\u2019s as matrix: morphology and mechanical \n\nperformance \n\n \n\n130 \n\n3.3.3 Pellets density \n\nFigure 3.4 indicates the apparent density of the cork-polymer composite pellets after the pultrusion \n\nprocess for all tested compositions presented in Table 3.1. The results indicate an important decrease \n\nin the density compared with the density of the matrix PE (964 kg m-3) and PP (900 kg m-3). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4. Density of the CPC pellets after the pultrusion process. \n\n \n\nThe pellets density is around 580-630 kg m-3 except for grinding cork powder with higher specific weight \n\n(see Table 3.2). The higher the density of the cork powder the superior is the density of the pellet \n\ncomposite. The production of composites by pultrusion process using high amounts of cork powder \n\nallows obtaining light weight composite materials. After compression moulding process of the pellets \n\nthe final density of the composites is higher and very similar (1000 to 1060 kg m-3) independently of the \n\ncork sub-product used. \n\n3.3.4 Crystallization and melting properties \n\nThermal properties of all materials prepared were investigated by DSC. Representative DSC curves for \n\nthe composites and pure PP are shown in Figure 3.5. The results are summarized in Table 3.3.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Cork based composites using polyolefins\u2019s as matrix: morphology and mechanical \n\nperformance \n\n \n\n131 \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 3.5. Representative DSC thermograms, obtained at 10\u00baCmin?1 of the CPC materials using PP as \n\nmatrix of the composite (a) second heating step and (b) first cooling step. \n\n \n\nPure PP presents a onset crystallization temperature (Tc) of 119.7 \u00baC. Comparing the pure PP with the \n\ncork-polymer composites, the Tc shifted to higher temperatures in the case of the composites. The \n\nincrease of Tc could be considered to be due to the nucleation effect of cork present in the composites.  \n\nMelting temperatures (Tm) of pure PP was 153.5 \u00baC. The Tms of the PP was not significantly affected by \n\nthe addition of cork during the pultrusion process. Therefore, the addition of cork powders in PP does \n\nnot have a significant influence on the thickness of the crystalline lamellar of the matrix. Values of ?Hm \n\nprovide important information about the crystallinity and shows significant variations in the composites. \n\nThese results lead us to conclude that the addition of cork powder increases the crystallinity of the \n\npolymer in the most part of the compositions. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Cork based composites using polyolefins\u2019s as matrix: morphology and mechanical \n\nperformance \n\n \n\n132 \n\nTable 3.3.

Nevertheless \n\nonce can observe simultaneously with this process the growth of individual of spherulites in the matrix. \n\nWhen cork is embedded into a thermoplastic melt it may act as a nucleating agent during the \n\ncrystallization process. The result is more evident on Figure 3.6 c) in polarized light where it confirms \n\nthe high number of spherulites around the cork. This nucleation effect is different from other fibres used \n\nin composites. In this case no transcrystalline layer on the cork usually found in semicrystalline \n\nthermoplastic composites with different synthetic or natural fibres [35-37] was observed. The present \n\neffect it is in accordance with the previous DSC results indicating the nucleation ability of cork. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Cork based composites using polyolefins\u2019s as matrix: morphology and mechanical \n\nperformance \n\n \n\n133 \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.6.

Figure 3.7and Figure 3.8 summarizes the obtained results, in terms of tensile \n\nmodulus and maximum tensile stress, for composites prepared with PP and PE matrices, respectively. \n\nOne formulation consisting of recycled polyolefin\u2019s and cork sanding powder was also compounded and \n\ncharacterized (Figure 3.8). All results are expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviation. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Cork based composites using polyolefins\u2019s as matrix: morphology and mechanical \n\nperformance \n\n \n\n134 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7.

(*) significant at 0.05; ns: \n\nnon-significant at 0.05. \n\n \n\nConsidering the data from both Figure 3.7 and Figure 3.8, it is clear that composites prepared using PP \n\nas matrix are the ones with better mechanical performance, being the condition PP-GP1 the one with \n\nthe highest stiffness and strength absolute values.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Cork based composites using polyolefins\u2019s as matrix: morphology and mechanical \n\nperformance \n\n \n\n135 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.8. Tensile properties of various CPC materials using PE and recycled polymer as matrix. (*) \n\nsignificant at 0.05; ns: non-significant at 0.05.: \n\n \n\nTwo reasons can be used to explain the better performance of this composition: (i) pure PP has better \n\nmechanical properties than PE; (ii) the grinding powder (Fig. 2) is mainly composed of the outer bark \n\nthat is denser and very similar to wood and could work as a more effective reinforcement. In general, \n\ncomposites from PP exhibited mean tensile modulus and maximum stress values respectively in the \n\nintervals [523.6 \u2013 650.5] MPa and [13.0 \u2013 18.7] MPa, depending on the type of cork powder used. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Cork based composites using polyolefins\u2019s as matrix: morphology and mechanical \n\nperformance \n\n \n\n136 \n\nComposites prepared using PE as matrix and the different cork based powders displayed mean \n\ncompressive modulus and maximum stress values respectively in the intervals [365.3 \u2013 545.8] MPa \n\nand [12.4 \u2013 16.0] MPa. Almost no correlation between the type of cork powders used and the final \n\nmechanical performance of the composites was observed. \n\nConsidering the formulation with best performance for each type of matrix used, the addition of 50 wt.% \n\nof cork powder in the most part of the compositions did not affect significantly (p&lt;0.05) the modulus of \n\nthe final product, especially for the composites prepared with PP. Nevertheless, a decrease higher than \n\n~50% on the strength was noticed.   \n\nAs expected, the addition of a small amount (only 2 wt.%) of coupling agents (102 \u2013 1 K1 MDEX for PE \n\nand Po 1020 K1 for PP) resulted in a significantly improvement (p&lt;0.05) of the mechanical \n\nperformance in all the formulations studied. This effect is more pronounced on the strength of \n\ncomposites prepared using PP as matrix and increases up to 40.9 % (condition PP-FP2) were achieved \n\nwith the addition of Po 1020 K1 coupling agent. This is a clear indication that the use of a coupling \n\nagent improved the interfacial adhesion between the matrix (PP or PE) and the cork based powder \n\nused. Several studies on the literature report the positive effect of using coupling agents on the \n\nmechanical properties of composites [31, 33]. \n\n3.4 Conclusions \n\nThe following conclusions can be made base on the results presented in this work. SEM observation \n\nrevealed well dispersed cork powders in the compression moulded samples after the pultrusion (pellets) \n\nand compression moulding processes. As expected, the tensile modulus and tensile strengths were \n\nsignificantly increased in the composites with the introduction low amounts (2 wt.%) of coupling agents \n\nto promote the adhesion between the cork-polymer phases. No significantly correlation between the \n\ntype of cork powders used and the mechanical performance of the composites was observed. Cork \n\npowders that presents some wood particles induces similar stiffness only in the PP matrix, probably \n\nbecause the powder composition is based on outer bark and has higher density. The recycled polymer \n\nbased on polyolefin\u2019s combined with the cork sanding powder reveal the lowest mechanical \n\nperformance. The increase of the crystallinity on the composites occurred due to the addition of the \n\ncork powder, where cork presents a nucleation effect. By polarized optical microscopy it was confirmed \n\nthat cork accelerates the crystallization process. The results of the present work clearly show that cork \n\npowders and polyolefin\u2019s can be successfully used to produce CPC with high cork content. In order to \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Cork based composites using polyolefins\u2019s as matrix: morphology and mechanical \n\nperformance \n\n \n\n137 \n\nobtain cork based composite materials with enhanced mechanical properties, reinforcement strategies \n\nmust be taken in consideration. \n\n3.5 References \n\n[1]  Gibson LJ.

In a further step, samples were produced by compression moulding \n\nusing the compounded composites. Bending strength, impact resistance, hardness, dimensional \n\nstability, thermal and acoustic properties of the developed cork-polymer composites (CPC) were \n\ndetermined and compared with commercially available products namely medium density fibreboard \n\n(MDF) and high density fibreboard (HDF). It was found that the CPC have good dimensional stability, \n\nlower water uptake, a better acoustic insulation performance and similar behaviour in terms of \n\nhardness and fire resistance when compared with both MDF and HDF. However, the mechanical \n\nstrength is inferior comparing with both commercial materials based on fibres. It was also observed that \n\naddition of cork improved the flexural modulus, impact resistance and hardness on the developed CPC. \n\nThus, the herein described CPC materials showed important characteristics to be considered as good \n\ncandidates to be applied in the design of flooring and construction systems. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n3\n This chapter is based on the following publication: \n\nFernandes EM, Correlo VM, Chagas JA, Mano JF and Reis RL, 2011, Properties of new cork-polymer composites: \n\nAdvantages and drawbacks as compared with commercially available fibreboard materials, Composite Structures, 93: 3120-\n\n3129. \n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Properties of new cork-polymer composites: Advantages and drawbacks as compared with \n\ncommercial available fibreboard materials \n\n \n\n143 \n\n4.1 Introduction \n\nWood polymer composites (WPC), have successfully proven their applicability in several fields, \n\nparticularly in the construction sector, due to their aesthetics (similar to wood), easy processability and \n\nlow maintenance costs [1]. The use of lingocellulosics materials as fillers and reinforcement with \n\nthermoplastics has been gaining acceptance in commodity plastic applications [2]. Similar to wood, \n\ncork is a natural, renewable and sustainable raw material [3-5] with an unexploited potential to be used \n\non the development of partially or completely natural based composites [6-9].  \n\nCork is the bark of an Oak tree known botanically as Quercus suber L. [10] which is periodically \n\nextracted from the tree, usually every nine to twelve years, depending on the culture region and is of the \n\nhighest importance for the forest economy of the Southern European countries and China [4, 10]. The \n\ncork-tree offers the advantage of being the only tree whose bark can regenerate itself after harvest, \n\nmaking it a truly renewable material. In terms of morphology, cork can be described as an anisotropic \n\nmaterial with close cellular structure and thin-walled cells. Furthermore, cork presents a alveolar \n\nstructure similar to a honeycomb according the radial direction and in the other directions \n\n(transversally) is a isotropic material where the cells are described as rectangular prisms packed base \n\nto base in columns parallel to the radial direction of the tree [11, 12]. A thickness of 1mm corresponds \n\nabout thirty layers of cells [13].  \n\nCork can be seen as a natural composite constituted by different groups of compounds. The chemical \n\ncomposition includes [4, 10]: suberin, an aliphatic polyester, usually present in high concentrations 33-\n\n50%; lignin, an aromatic polymer, corresponding to the second most abundant structure in cork with \n\n13-29%; polysaccharides, including cellulose and hemicelluloses, that are usually present at \n\nconcentrations in the range of 6-25%; and the extractable components at concentrations in the range \n\n8.5-24%.  \n\nThe structural properties of lingocellulosic materials like cork are strongly dependent on temperature. \n\nThermal decomposition of cork has been studied by thermogravimetry [14] and the results have shown \n\nthat the mass decreases about 30% upon heating at 300\u00baC and less than 10% at 200\u00baC [15]. It was \n\nalso observed that the chemical degradation starts at about 250\u00baC, in air, indicating that cork can be \n\nheated up to 250\u00baC without inducing irreversible changes in its composition. Chemical methods [16, \n\n17] and scanning electron microscopy [16] were also applied and the results demonstrated that waxes \n\nand other soluble components of cork begin to decompose at ca. 150\u00baC and that cork is transformed \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Properties of new cork-polymer composites: Advantages and drawbacks as compared with \n\ncommercial available fibreboard materials \n\n \n\n144 \n\ninto ash for temperatures above 450\u00baC. Polysaccharides are considered the most heat sensitive \n\ncomponent of cork [18]. Mass spectroscopy [19] and 13C solid-state NMR studies [17] reveal that at \n\n400\u00b0C cork has been transformed into coke with traces of partially decomposed suberin. \n\nThe most important sub-products resulting from cork manufacturing are different types of cork powders. \n\nPart of these powders are used as fuel on industrial furnaces, while the remaining portions are usually \n\ndisposed in landfills [20, 21]. The strategy of combining cork powder with polymeric matrixes [9, 21, \n\n22], to produce composites, has received little attention by the research community. However, cork \n\nproperties can provide several advantages in the development of composites containing bio-based \n\ncomponents. Among other advantages, cork has a low density (120 \u2013 240 kg m-3), can be regarded as \n\na hydrophobic and viscoelastic material, that possess high thermal and acoustic insulation properties, \n\nlow thermal conductivity, fire resistance, aesthetic features and resistance to microbial activity [3, 4, 13, \n\n23]. Moreover, cork powder is widely available, sustainable, recyclable and of low cost. \n\nThe development of appropriated methodologies for the valorisation of this bio-based resource is of high \n\ninterest [9]. In this work two melt based technologies were used to produce cork-polymer composites \n\n(CPC) materials: pultrusion to compound and obtain pellets of two different composites (cork powder + \n\nPP and cork powder + PE, in both cases a 50/50 wt.% ratio was used) and compression moulding to \n\nproduce boards with adequate characteristics to be applied as core in flooring systems, furniture and \n\nbuilding applications. The use of a core based on CPC in alternative to the MDF could be regarded as a \n\nnew type of flooring able to compete in the field of the floating floor coverings. For instance, wood-\n\nplastic composites have shown distinctly better behaviour than the MDF and natural wood after \n\nmoisture exposure [24]. The growing of environmental awareness has resulted in a renewed interest in \n\nthe use of natural materials with environmentally friendly characteristics [25]. Formaldehyde-based \n\nadhesives are currently used for fibreboard manufacture where the major drawback of using this resin \n\nis the presence of volatile organic compounds harmful to human health [26, 27].  \n\nIn this study, different boards - produced using the CPC composites, the MDF and the HDF - were \n\nsubmitted to extensive characterization tests and the obtained results compared. The main goal was to \n\nprove and validate the potential of using the cork-based composites on the production of boards as core \n\nfor floating floor coverings application. We selected to test MDF and HDF boards as control since they \n\nare the most widely used wood composites applied as building material, housing furniture and in \n\nlaminated flooring [26-28]. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Properties of new cork-polymer composites: Advantages and drawbacks as compared with \n\ncommercial available fibreboard materials \n\n \n\n145 \n\n4.2 Experimental section \n\n4.2.1 Cork powder and fibre materials \n\nThe cork powder resulting from cork processing stages such as, sanding and external operations, was \n\ncollected at Amorim Revestimentos S.A. (Oleiros, Portugal) industrial facilities. The cork powder \n\npresents a particle size of ? 250 \u00b5m, bulk density of 157 \u00b1 2 kg m-3 and a humidity of ~5.4%. It was \n\nalso used two different types of fibreboard materials as control: HDF with density of 920.3 \u00b1 6.7 kg m-3 \n\nand MDF with density of 822.7 \u00b1 2.7 kg m-3 both of them with a resin content of 8 wt.% and supplied by \n\nSonae Industria SGPS, S.A (Maia, Portugal). \n\n4.2.2 Polymeric materials \n\nA commercially available high density polyethylene (HMA \u2013 025), HDPE, containing a thermal stabilizer \n\nand with a MFI of 8 g 10 min-1 and a polypropylene homopolymer (1374 E2), PP, with a MFI of 21 g 10 \n\nmin-1 were used on composites preparation. Both polymers were supplied by Exxon Mobil (Germany). \n\nMore details on the properties of these polymers are reported in Table 4.1. \n\n \n\nTable 4.1.

Before compounding the moisture content on the cork powder was ? 3 %. Two different cork-\n\nbased composites \u2013 one consisting of cork powder with PE and other consisting of cork powder with PP \n\n(in both cases 50-50 wt.% ratio was maintained) \u2013 were compounded using an industrial pultrusion \n\nsystem (Palltruder PFV 250, Germany). The CPC consisting of HDPE with cork powder will be referred \n\nas PE/Cork and the one from PP and cork powder as PP/Cork. \n\nThe composites, as pellets, were further compression-moulded using a Moore hydraulic press (UK) to \n\nproduce rectangular boards of 220?220?6 mm3. The principal processing conditions are reported in \n\nTable 4.2 and are similar to the ones used in previous work [9]. Flexural, impact and tensile bars were \n\ncut from these boards using a CNC machine (Roland 3D Plotter MDX-20, UK). \n\n \n\nTable 4.2.

To determine the water absorption, \n\nspecimens (measuring 6mm in thickness, 60mm wide and 90 mm long) from the different materials \n\nwere immersed in distilled water, at 23 \u00b1 1 \u00baC and atmospheric pressure, for different time periods (up \n\nto 11 days). In the end of each time period, five specimens of each material were removed, gently \n\nblotted with tissue paper to remove the excess water on the surface and immediately weighed. The \n\nwater absorption was calculated according to the Eq. (4.1): \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Properties of new cork-polymer composites: Advantages and drawbacks as compared with \n\ncommercial available fibreboard materials \n\n \n\n147 \n\n100(%) ?\n?\n\n?\nb\n\nba\n\nW\n\nWW\nabsorptionWater\n\n   (4.1) \n\n \n\nwhere Wa = weight of the specimen after being immersed for a certain period of time and Wb = weight of \n\nthe same specimen before immersion (g). \n\nTo determine thickness swelling after immersion, the thickness of each immersed specimen was \n\nmeasured in two different points using a digital micrometer (\u00b1 0.01 mm). The thickness swelling was \n\ncalculated as follows: \n\n \n\n100(%)\n1\n\n12\n?\n\n?\n?\n\nT\n\nTT\nswellingThickness\n\n    (4.2) \n\n \n\nwhere T2 = thickness of the specimen after immersion and T1 = thickness of the same specimen before \n\nimmersion. Three specimens per each condition were measured.. \n\n4.2.5 Warping and density \n\nWarping can result from an inferior product construction, wrong choice of materials or inadequate \n\nprocessing routes. Other reason that can cause this effect is the high moisture content in the air. After \n\nprocessing, CPC boards (220?220?6 mm3) obtained by compression moulding were submitted to a \n\nspecific test to access the possible occurrence of warping effect. The obtained results were compared \n\nwith the commercial fibreboard composites cut with the same dimensions. In Figure 4.1 is shown a \n\nschematic illustration of the performed test. Figure 4.1 a) shows the used system with a pointer p with \n\nprecision capability of 0.01 mm of displacement.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1. Scheme of the specimen\u2019s geometry: (a) with the measuring system and (b) board with \n\nwarping \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Properties of new cork-polymer composites: Advantages and drawbacks as compared with \n\ncommercial available fibreboard materials \n\n \n\n148 \n\n \n\nTwo perpendicular measurements in each board were performed according the indicated directions a \n\nand b. At least 15 boards (in dry state) of each condition were analysed to evaluate the warping effect. \n\nThe density of the materials was determined according the ASTM D 792 \u2013 00 [30], using an analytical \n\nbalance equipped with a stationary support for the immersion vessel. Five specimens were weighted \n\nper each sample. \n\n4.2.6 Mechanical tests \n\nThe mechanical properties of the developed cork-based composites were determined performing \n\nflexural and impact tests. In more detail, three point static flexural tests were carried out in accordance \n\nwith standard ISO 178 [31]. The dimensions of the specimens used were 120 mm length, 15 mm \n\nwidth and 6 mm thick. The load was placed midway between the supports with a span (L) of 80 mm. \n\nThe crosshead speed was 2.56 mm/min. These tested were performed in an Instron 4505 Universal \n\nMachine (USA) equipped with a 1 kN cell load. For each condition, the specimens were loaded until the \n\ncore break. The Charpy impact tests were performed according the standard ISO 179-1 [32] on a Ceast \n\nFractovis (Pianezza, Italy) instrumented falling weight impact tester with a pendulum energy of 2 J. The \n\nnotched specimens were rectangular bars with 120 mm length, 12 mm width and 6 mm thick.  The \n\nhardness was determined by Shore-D Hardnes Tester (model bareiss \u2013 Pr\u00fcfger\u00e4te, Germany). For each \n\nsample, the value of Shore-D was calculated as the average of 10 indentations. All performed tests were \n\ncarried out in a standard laboratory atmosphere of 23\u00baC and 50% of relative humidity and seven \n\nspecimens of each material were tested. \n\n4.2.7 Morphology \n\nTo investigate cork distribution on the composite matrix and the fibreboard specimens, the fracture \n\nsurface was analysed using a stereoscopic lens microscope Olympus SZ-PT (Tokyo, Japan) equipped \n\nwith a light source Olympus Europe Highlight 2000, (Germany) and an Olympus DP11, (Japan) digital \n\ncamera.  \n\nFor more detailed analysis of the microstructure of the cork-polymer phases, fracture surfaces of the \n\ndifferent specimens were examined using a NanoSEM 200 FEI (The Netherlands) scanning electron \n\nmicroscope (SEM). Before being analysed all the samples were coated by ion sputtering with an Au/Pd \n\nalloy (80-20 wt.%) in a high resolution sputter coater of Cressington 208HR (Watford, UK). \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Properties of new cork-polymer composites: Advantages and drawbacks as compared with \n\ncommercial available fibreboard materials \n\n \n\n149 \n\n4.2.8 Thermal properties \n\nThe thermal stability studies, determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were performed to \n\nunderstand the degradation characteristics of the specimens using a TGA Q500 series \n\nthermogravimetric analyser (TA Instruments, USA). Experiments were performed in platinum pan, at a \n\nheating rate of 10 \u00b0C.min-1 from 50 \u00b0C to 600 \u00b0C in air atmosphere. Analyses were performed in two \n\nsamples of each condition.  \n\n4.2.9 Fire resistance \n\nIn designing building materials, fire resistance classification of the product is one of the most important \n\nfeatures. Single flame fire tests were carried out according to the standard ISO 11925-2 [33]. The \n\nsingle flame source test was performed in specimens with dimensions of 188 x 119 mm2 and 6 mm \n\nthick. The specimen was held vertically and a flame was applied from the bottom edge of the specimen \n\nbecoming more aggressive effect on the materials. According to the standard a burning time of 15 to \n\n20 seconds was applied and the burning dimensions after the test were registered. Three specimens \n\nwere tested for each composite. The fire resistance classification was attributed according of the \n\nstandard fire test of building materials EN ISO 13501-1 [34]. \n\n4.2.10 Acoustic tests \n\nThe building elements for acoustic tests consisted on a superior element from CPC or fibreboard with \n\ndimensions of 220X220X6 mm3 and an agglomerated cork underlay with thickness of 1.8 mm thick. \n\nCommercially available silicone glue (thickness of 0.5-0.6mm) was used to fix the agglomerated cork \n\nunderlay to the previously produced boards (CPC, HDF and MDF boards).The aim of including this \n\nagglomerated cork underlay was to avoid reverberation sound and fix the boards. The pavement was \n\nsubmitted to a uniformly distributed load (20 to 25 kg m-2). The tests were conduct in a reverberant \n\nchamber with a 7.25 m length, 5.88 m width, 4.65 m height and a volume of 202 m3. The tests occur \n\nat atmospheric conditions 22 \u00baC and 66 % of humidity. The equipment used for the measurements was \n\na tapping machine Br\u00fcel &amp; Kjaer (B&amp;K, Germany) Type 3204; B&amp;K 2260 dual channel real-time \n\nfrequency analyser and B&amp;K 13 mm microphone model 4189. The microphone height was about 1.4 \n\nm. The measurements of sound insulation were performed according the standard EN ISO 140-8 [35] \n\nand 717-2 [36]. The measurements were taken at three locations of the tapping machine relative to the \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Properties of new cork-polymer composites: Advantages and drawbacks as compared with \n\ncommercial available fibreboard materials \n\n \n\n150 \n\nfloor sample area of 2 m2 and 5 positions of microphone with to different lectures using one-third-octave \n\nbands, 100 Hz to 4200 Hz. The reduction of impact noise by floor covering on standard floor was \n\ndetermined according the equation 4.3: \n\n \n\nnn\nLLL ???\n\n0,    (4.3) \n\n \n\nwhere, ? L  is the reduction of impact sound pressure level, Ln,0 is the normalized impact sound \n\npressure level in the absence of floor covering and Ln is the normalized impact sound pressure level \n\nwith floor covering. The impact sound improvement index (?Lw) was determined according to the \n\nstandard EN ISO 717-2 [36]. \n\n4.3 Results and discussion \n\n4.3.1 Dimensional stability tests \n\nThe results from the water absorption and thickness swelling tests are shown in Figure 4.2 and Figure \n\n4.3 respectively. In the first 6h of immersion, the fibreboards samples absorbed 10.8 \u00b1 0.4 % (HDF \n\nboards) and 14.8 \u00b1 0.8 % (MDF boards). In the first 48 h of immersion the CPC samples absorbed less \n\nthan 1% of water while the HDF and MDF ones absorbed 32.7 \u00b1 1.5 % and 49.7 \u00b1 0.7 % respectively. \n\nMoreover, after 11 days of immersion the maximum water absorption percentage of the developed CPC \n\nboards was 3.7 \u00b1 0.6 % (for the PP/Cork) whereas the HDF and MDF boards absorbed, respectively, \n\n77.9 \u00b1 2.4 % and 125.6 \u00b1 0.9 %. These differences (more than 70%) can be explained by the high \n\namount of polyolefin (50 wt.%) present in the CPC composition since, the non-polar polyolefin absorbs \n\nno or little water amount [25, 37] and the inner volume accessible for water and oxygen is essentially \n\nzero [38].  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Properties of new cork-polymer composites: Advantages and drawbacks as compared with \n\ncommercial available fibreboard materials \n\n \n\n151 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2. Water absorption behaviour for the tested specimens during the immersion time (a) and \n\ndetail of the water absorption for the cork based composites (b). \n\n \n\nMoreover, cork can also be considered a hydrophobic material. These results clearly indicate that CPC \n\nboards are more hydrophobic and absorb much less moisture than the hydrophilic MDF or HDF ones. \n\nThese results also point out that CPC boards are more suitable to be used on environments where the \n\nmaterials are exposed to high moisture content than the control samples. Similar behaviour was \n\nobserved for wood polyolefin composites developed using melt based technologies [39, 40]. Like in \n\nwood composites, the water absorption in CPC materials occurs due to the presence of fine pores or \n\nlenticels in the cork particles (capillary absorption) and hydrogen bonding sites, or by some micro-\n\ncracks or gaps in the interface between cork particles and the polymeric matrix. \n\nThe thickness swelling results are shown in Figure 4.3. The values observed for both fibreboards are \n\nconsiderably higher than the ones observed for the CPC boards. After an immersion period of 264 \n\nhours, the values of thickness swelling were, respectively, 0.5 \u00b1 0.2 % and 0.8 \u00b1 0.3 % for the PP/Cork \n\nand PE/Cork based composites, indicating good dimensional stability. On the contrary, for the same \n\ntime period, the thickness swelling values of MDF and HDF were 85.3 \u00b1 1.5 and 44.1 \u00b1 1.0, \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Properties of new cork-polymer composites: Advantages and drawbacks as compared with \n\ncommercial available fibreboard materials \n\n \n\n152 \n\nrespectively. Moreover, for the fibreboard specimens, thickness swelling values followed a similar trend \n\nto water absorption behaviour: thickness swelling values increased with the immersion time (Figure 4.3).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3. Thickness swelling of the fibreboard materials and the cork based composites during the \n\nimmersion tests. \n\n \n\nThe CPC materials had a different behaviour: the thickness swelling was very low and the variation \n\nbetween the different immersion periods is almost insignificant. As in the water absorption behaviour, \n\nthe low thickness swelling values of CPC materials can be an advantage for its application on the \n\ndevelopment and construction of several products, including its application as core material for \n\nlaminated floor applications. \n\n4.3.2 Warping and density \n\nThe density and warping values for the different materials are shown in Table 4.3. The warping of the \n\ncontrol fibreboards was near zero, with the mean value of 0.14% for MDF and 0.18% for the HDF. The \n\ndeveloped CPC materials registered warping values of 1.26% for PE/Cork and 1.44% for PP/Cork. \n\nThese values, although higher than ones registered for the fibreboards, can be considered small enough \n\nto classify the developed composites of high dimensional stability. The warping values were reduced \n\nwith the addition of cork powder and are probably related with the crystallinity of the polymeric matrices \n\n(PP and PE) [38] where the presence of 50 wt.% of cork powder noticeably reduced the warping when it \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Properties of new cork-polymer composites: Advantages and drawbacks as compared with \n\ncommercial available fibreboard materials \n\n \n\n153 \n\nwas applied the compression moulded process. Additionally, thicker areas cooled slower and part \n\ndistortion could occur [41]. In this last case the warping can be reduced by increasing the cooling time \n\nduring the compression moulding process.  \n\n \n\nTable 4.3.

These values are higher than the ones observed for the \n\nfibreboards. To understand this effect is important to note that the cork cell wall density has been \n\nestimated to be 1200 kg m\u20133  [3, 4]. Previous work using similar cork-polyolefin formulations [9] \n\nindicates a bulk density of the CPC pellets after pultrusion  of around 590 \u00b1  11.4 Kg m-3 to 602 \u00b1  13.4 \n\nKg m-3. The densification occurs in the compression moulding step due to the high applied compression \n\nforce of 1.42MPa. Studies on wood-polyolefin (50-50 wt.%) composites regarding thermal and photo-\n\noxidative stability indicate that the composite density controls the amount of air oxygen flowing into the \n\npores of the composite matrix [38]. The higher density of a composite material blocks the access of \n\noxygen and slows the oxidative degradation process. \n\n4.3.3 Mechanical tests \n\nFlexural, impact and hardness properties of the different materials were determined and the results are \n\nshown in Table 4.4. All results are expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviation. The flexural strength \n\nobtained for the fibreboard samples were higher than the results obtained with the CPC materials \n\n(Figure 4.4). The flexural strength and modulus of the control materials based on fibres where, \n\nrespectively, ~58.9 MPa and ~5.3 GPa for the HDF and ~49.6 MPa and ~4.4 GPa for the MDF. The \n\nCPC materials presented modulus in the interval [1.8 \u2013 1.3] GPa and strengths in the interval [19.1 \u2013 \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Properties of new cork-polymer composites: Advantages and drawbacks as compared with \n\ncommercial available fibreboard materials \n\n \n\n154 \n\n17.1] MPa. The better mechanical performance of the CPC prepared with PP as matrix was expected \n\nsince this polyolefin has better mechanical properties than the used PE. The lower values observed for \n\nthe CPC samples can be related with the lack of interfacial adhesion and bonding between the matrix \n\nand the cork powder. Due to this, no stress transfer occurs during deformation resulting in low \n\nmechanical performance.  \n\n \n\nTable 4.4.

The samples \n\nfrom PE/Cork are the most ductile of the tested materials with 2.46% deformation, where the MDF \n\npresents a close value of 2.30%. The high capacity of deformation of polyolefin is well known from the \n\nliterature [42]. However, the addition of high percentages of cork (50 wt.%) reduced the maximum \n\nstrain to less than 3%. The results are in accordance with other composite materials like wood-\n\nthermoplastic composites, where the increase of wood content increases the flexural modulus and \n\ndecreases the flexural strength and maximum strain values of the composites [1, 43]. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Properties of new cork-polymer composites: Advantages and drawbacks as compared with \n\ncommercial available fibreboard materials \n\n \n\n155 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4. Flexural stress-strain curves of the developed cork based composites and the fibreboard \n\nmaterials. \n\n \n\nThe purpose of the impact tests was to measure and compare the resilience, i.e. the energy absorption \n\ncapacity of the different materials. As expected, the Charpy notched impact strength of fibreboard \n\nsamples, mainly the ones from MDF, exhibited better mechanical properties when compared with the \n\ndeveloped CPC materials. The neat polymers present the lower value of impact strength of 4.4 kJ m-2 for \n\nHDPE and of 2.8 kJ m-2 for the PP. Nevertheless, the addition of 50 wt.% of cork powder to the HDPE \n\nand PP matrices increased, respectively, ~31% and ~51% the impact strength, indicating that the \n\npresence of cork in the composite reinforces the energy absorption capacity. The cellular and elastic \n\nstructure of cork [3, 4] can be an explanation for these results. Regarding the CPC materials, the \n\nenergy absorption capacity of PP/Cork composite was 20% higher than in the PE/Cork composite. \n\nSince it was used the same amount of cork powder (50 wt.%) and the processing conditions were \n\nsimilar, the higher MFI of PP contributed to a better dispersion of cork powder in the matrix and \n\nconsequently increase in the absorption capacity. In terms of hardness, the specimens present similar \n\nvalues, around 49 to 51 Shore D, being the lower value corresponding to PE/cork and the high value to \n\nMDF material. When cork powder was added, hardness and the flexural modulus increased for both \n\ncases, probably due to the pultrusion process and the applied pressure of 1.42 MPa during the \n\ncompression moulding process. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Properties of new cork-polymer composites: Advantages and drawbacks as compared with \n\ncommercial available fibreboard materials \n\n \n\n156 \n\n4.3.4 Morphology \n\nThe fracture surface, after Charpy notched impact tests, of the studied materials was analysed by \n\noptical microscopy and the results presented in Figure 4.5.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.5. Fracture surfaces of the specimens after Charpy notched impact tests with a) PP/Cork (50\u2013\n\n50wt%), b) PE/Cork (50\u201350wt%), c) HDF and d) MDF.  \n\n \n\nFor both CPC materials, it was observed a good dispersion of the cork powder particles in the polymeric \n\nmatrix. In the case of the CPC with PP matrix it seems that cork distribution is more homogeneous. A \n\npossible explanation is the higher MFI value of the PP when compared with the MFI of HDPE (see Table \n\n4.1). The fibreboard materials illustrate the well known fibrous aspect where the fibres are stacked like \n\nrows. This fibrous morphology is consistent with the previously reported results, namely the higher \n\nflexural mechanical performance and the ability of water to penetrate on these structures, inducing \n\nhigher thickness swelling variations.  \n\nSEM micrographs from the same fracture surfaces are presented in Figure 4.6. At low magnification \n\n(Figure 4.6 a and Figure 4.6 b) it is visible the high volume content of cork powder in the CPC materials.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Properties of new cork-polymer composites: Advantages and drawbacks as compared with \n\ncommercial available fibreboard materials \n\n \n\n157 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.6. Micrographs of the impact fracture surfaces of the (a, c) PE/Cork (50\u201350wt%) and (b, d) \n\nPP/Cork (50\u201350wt%) composites. \n\n \n\nThe cork powder/polymer weight ratio used for the composites preparation was 50%, but the volume \n\nthis ratio is respectively, 86 % - 14 %, respectively. In Figure 4.6 c is shown the morphology of the \n\nPE/Cork (50-50 wt.%) material, where is possible to see the stretching of the PE between the cork cell \n\nwalls. The same effect was observed for the CPC with PP matrix (Figure 4.6 d). Both images suggest \n\nthat the surface of the cork particles interacted well with the polymeric matrix since voids or empty \n\nspaces between the two phases were not detected. \n\n4.3.5 Thermal properties \n\nThe results of the termogravimetric analysis (TGA), conducted under air atmosphere, and the respective \n\nderivate (DTG) are shown in Figure 4.7. Relevant data from all materials are summarized in Table 4.5.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Properties of new cork-polymer composites: Advantages and drawbacks as compared with \n\ncommercial available fibreboard materials \n\n \n\n158 \n\n  \n\nFigure 4.7.

In the case \n\nof the fibreboards the moisture content was higher, presenting at 100\u00baC values of around 6 % \n\ncomparing with 3.4 % in cork. Nevertheless, as described in the literature, at 100 \u00baC the moisture \n\npresent in cork is not totally eliminated [14]. As expected, the current thermoplastics did not present \n\nresidual moisture and, when combined with cork powder the CPC materials presented a weight loss in \n\nthis region of 0.6 - 0.7 %.  \n\n \n\nTable 4.5.

This \n\nresult suggests that the cork powder can be processed with polymers having melting temperatures \n\nlower than this value, such as the used polyolefin\u2019s. However, other effects like colour change of cork, \n\npromoted by the temperature and the processing time, must be considered. Additionally, results from \n\nFigure 4.7 have shown that when cork powder is mixed with PP through melt-based technologies the \n\nthermal stability of the polymer increases. \n\nAnalysing DTG curve from cork powder, two maximum peaks were detected, one at 348 \u00baC and other at \n\n458 \u00baC, being the first one of large intensity. The first peak corresponds to the two major constituents of \n\ncork (lignin and suberin fractions) and the second one can be attributed to suberin, the most thermal \n\nresistant component in cork. The polysaccharides composed by cellulose and hemicellulose have \n\ndegradation temperatures in the range between 300 \u00baC to 400 \u00baC [44].  \n\nThe small values of weight loss (0.76 %) and the high onset temperature (274 \u00baC) (see Table 4.5) \n\nobtained for HDPE are consistent with the presence of the thermal stabilizer. Other effect can be \n\nidentified if the DTG values from both CPC are compared. In the case of PE/Cork the decomposition \n\ntemperature peak (Tmax1) occurred at 341 \u00baC with a weight loss of 28 %. For PP/Cork the Tmax1 occurred \n\nearlier, at 313\u00baC with higher weight loss of 59 %.  \n\nBoth fibreboard materials showed multi-stepped degradation processes due to the presence of different \n\nspecies on their composition (data not shown). Literature described that the pyrolysis of wood begins \n\nwith an early decomposition of hemicelluloses, followed by an early stage of pyrolysis of lignin, where \n\nthe major decomposition temperature is normally attributed to the degradation of the cellulose [45].  \n\nComparing all the tested materials, the most resistant is HDPE and PE/cork composite, since the used \n\nthermoplastic composition includes a thermal stabilizer. The fraction of the inorganic components, \n\nremaining from cork powder or from fibreboards, after exposed to 600 \u00baC, is minimal being 1% for cork \n\npowder and less than 0.6 % for the fibreboards. \n\n4.3.6 Fire resistance \n\nThe burning rates of the two different CPC and fibreboard materials were determined by single flame \n\nfire test (table 6). The set-up procedure for testing the fire resistance is illustrated in Figure 4.8 a. In this \n\ntest the flame takes contact at the edges of the specimen and start to burn in the vertical direction. \n\nWhen the neat HDPE was submitted to the flame (Figure 4.8) the material started dripping after a few \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Properties of new cork-polymer composites: Advantages and drawbacks as compared with \n\ncommercial available fibreboard materials \n\n \n\n160 \n\nseconds and the integrity of the material was completely lost. The addition of 50 wt.% of cork powder to \n\nthe polymeric matrix improved such behaviour and the composites maintained the integrity during the \n\nwhole test. The presence of cork powder sustained the polymeric phase and acted as a fire retardant \n\nimproving the performance of the composites. This behaviour reinforces and agrees with the results \n\nobtained with the TGA analysis.  The fire resistance tests conducted on the fibreboards revealed that \n\nthese materials possess a self-extinguishing behaviour after removing the flame. This behaviour was not \n\nobserved for the composite materials since the flame does not extinguish eventually (Figure 4.8c).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.8. System for testing the fire resistance (a) behaviour of PE to the flame (b) and CPC behaviour \n\nafter fire test  of the PE/Cork (50\u201350wt%) specimen (c). \n\n \n\nTable 4.6.

Between the two CPC composites no relevant differences were found. In our opinion, the effect \n\nof the cork powder is higher and overlaps with the thermal stabilizer in HDPE. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Properties of new cork-polymer composites: Advantages and drawbacks as compared with \n\ncommercial available fibreboard materials \n\n \n\n161 \n\nThe results from the fire resistance tests (Table 4.6) indicated that all tested specimens possess a good \n\nbehaviour regarding fire resistance since all the tested materials had a classification of E. \n\n4.3.7 Acoustic tests \n\nBy measuring the impact sound pressure level reduction, ?L, of the different board materials (Figure \n\n4.9), it was possible to compare, as a function of the frequency, the behaviour of the different board \n\nsystems. As expected, the sound pressure level reduction increased as the frequency increased. \n\nMoreover, it was found that, at high frequencies, the cork-based composite showed better behaviour \n\nwhen compared with the commercially fibreboard materials.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.9. Impact sound reduction ?L vs. frequency due to installation of the tested materials: (?) \n\nMDF; (?) HDF and (?) PE/Cork (50 \u2013 50 wt%). Experimental results in the 1/3 octave band frequency \n\ndomain. \n\n \n\nThe impact sound attenuation index (?Lw), is useful for a direct comparison of the reduction in impact \n\nnoise transmission by the floor coverings. The ?Lw values ranged from 18 dB (for MDF and HDF floor \n\ncovering) to 20 dB for the (PE/Cork) floor covering. The obtained values are in the same range of \n\nvalues in the literature [46, 47]. The cellular and corrugated structure of cork together with the high \n\nvolume percentage of this natural material (~ 86%) can be the key for the superior ?Lw value of 20 dB. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Properties of new cork-polymer composites: Advantages and drawbacks as compared with \n\ncommercial available fibreboard materials \n\n \n\n162 \n\nThe board density, which is described as a parameter affecting the sound transmission properties, can \n\nexplain the improved behaviour of the MDF compared with HDF in terms of impact sound reduction \n\nespecially for medium and high frequencies. In the literature is also pointed that the use of urea-\n\nformaldehyde (UF) resin in the fibre based materials can also contribute to additional improvement on \n\nthe acoustic properties [28]. \n\nIn the present work the ?Lw of the all tested floor coverings was influenced by the use of silicon glue to \n\nfix the cork underlay to the boards. The silicon might also improve the soundproof properties providing \n\na small increase on the impact sound attenuation index values for all tested boards. The commercial \n\nfibreboard tested materials also present a small percentage of UF resin. \n\n4.4 Conclusions \n\nThe purpose of this study was to compare two different CPC materials with two commercially available \n\nfibreboard materials and detect its advantages and drawbacks. The obtained results showed the \n\npotential of this natural-based product on the development of composites with improved characteristics \n\nnamely, low water absorption, fire resistance, impact resistance and insulation properties.  \n\nBoth CPC materials compounded by pultrusion and further processed by compression moulding \n\npresented a good dispersion and distribution of the cork powder particles in the thermoplastic matrix. \n\nMoreover, the CPCs reveal good dimensional stability with low water absorption in comparison with \n\nfibreboard materials.  \n\nThe mechanical properties of the fibre-based materials were considerably superior compared with the \n\nones from the CPCs. With the addition of cork (50 wt.%), the flexural strength and strain were \n\nconsiderably reduced and the modulus was improved in both cases. The impact resistance tests \n\nconfirm that the addition of cork powder improved the energy absorption capacity of the used \n\npolyolefin\u2019s.  \n\nThe presence of cork presents the advantage to act as fire retardant in the thermoplastic composite \n\nmaterials. The acoustic behaviour revealed that CPC materials possess improved impact sound \n\ninsulation properties, low water absorption and reduced thickness swelling. These materials proved to \n\nbe good candidates to be used as underlay materials on floor applications. The developed cork \n\ncomposite materials present some promising properties, although reinforcement strategies to reach to \n\nhigher stiffness and strength could be needed for specific applications. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Properties of new cork-polymer composites: Advantages and drawbacks as compared with \n\ncommercial available fibreboard materials \n\n \n\n163 \n\n4.5 References \n\n[1]  Bledzki AK, Reihmane S, Gassan J.

In this work, cork particles and powder were compounded with \n\npolypropylene (PP) by twin-screw extrusion and further processed by injection or compression moulding. \n\nThe obtained PP/Cork injection moulded composites were used to investigate the tensile properties \n\nbefore and after water absorption (WA) tests. The addition of polypropylene-graft-maleic anhydride (PP-g-\n\nMA) and stearic acid was evaluated. The composites show good distribution and dispersion of cork with \n\ninteresting aesthetic characteristics. Low cork content (5wt.%) reinforces the stiffness of the PP. The \n\naddition of PP-g-MA up to 8 wt.%  promotes an increase on the tensile strength while the stearic acid \n\ncontributes only with a slight increase on the tensile strain. The thermo-physical properties were \n\ninvestigated and the composites present low WA. In general the tensile properties of the composites \n\nwere not significantly affected after the WA tests. Moreover, the WA was found to increase with an \n\nincrease in cork content and was reduced with the PP-g-MA and stearic acid. It was also found, that \n\ncork act as nucleating agent and promotes antioxidant protection to PP. Both properties ameliorate with \n\nthe increase of the cork content. Low cork content improves the thermal resistance while increasing the \n\nbio-based component increases the composite density and the thermal conductivity. The maximum \n\nincorporation of cork on the PP matrix through extrusion process was 93% in volume. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n4\n This chapter is based on the following publication: \n\nFernandes EM, Correlo VM, Mano JF, Reis RL, 2013, Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters \n\nand properties, submitted. \n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties \n\n \n\n169 \n\n5.1 Introduction \n\nPolypropylene (PP) is a thermoplastic being widely applied in the industry and is usually combined with \n\ninorganic particles or fibres aiming to improve its mechanical properties and reduce cost [1]. The \n\nmostly used inorganic fillers includes talc [2, 3], mica [4], clay [5], calcium carbonate (CaCO3) [6], \n\ncarbon and glass fibres [7, 8]. Combining or replacing the inorganic part by lignocellulosic materials \n\nwould be highly beneficial from the point of view of the environmental sustainability. The rational on \n\nusing lignocellulosic materials as filler and reinforcement of thermoplastic composites relies on its \n\nadvantageous intrinsic properties including low density, low cost, favourable strength/weight, high filling \n\nlevels, renewable and sustainable source, non-toxic, low hardness, low energy consumption, and \n\nrecyclability [9-11]. Potential applications of these eco-friendly composites include automotive, building \n\nand furniture industry [10].  \n\nCork is the bark of the cork oak tree (Quercus suber L.) [12-14] and is a natural and complex polymeric \n\ncomposite material. Chemically, this plant tissue contains suberin (30-60 %), lignin (19-22 %), \n\npolysaccharides (12-20 %) and extractives (9-20 %) [13, 14]. Furthermore, cork presents closed cell \n\nstructure and viscoelastic properties, exceptional insulation properties, is chemically inert, fire \n\nresistance and resistance to microbial decay [13, 15-17]. Nowadays, cork-polymer composites are one \n\nof the most promising fields under development in the cork industry aiming to create sustainable \n\nmaterials. Research involving cork and cork by-products combined with thermoplastics [15, 18, 19], \n\nthermosets [15, 20] and, more recently, with bio-based matrices [21, 22] can be found in the literature. \n\nAs for other lignocellulosic composites, the final properties of these cork composites are highly \n\ndependent on the processing conditions. Thus, the final specifications of a cork composite can be \n\ntailored for a specific application by varying the compounding process, amount and cork particle size, \n\nchemical or surface treatment and type and amount of coupling agent [15, 23-25]. The ability to stress \n\ntransfer from the thermoplastic matrix to the cork filler or reinforcement will depend essentially of the \n\ncork-polymer interactions that can be reduced due to the incompatibility between lignocellulosic \n\nmaterials and polymeric matrices. To overcome these limitations it is necessary to promote polymer \n\nmodification with polar groups, such as maleic anhydride and their grafted polymers, stearic acid, \n\nsilanes, zirconate, or titanate in order to enhance the adhesion between the polymeric matrix and the \n\nlignocellulosic component [26-29]. One of the most widely used coupling agents is polypropylene graft \n\nmaleic anhydride (PP-g-MA). It is pointed that the interactions between anhydride groups of maleated \n\ncoupling agents and the hydroxyl groups of natural fibres can overcome the problem of incompatibility, \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties \n\n \n\n170 \n\nincreasing the interfacial adhesion between both components and, consequently, the mechanical \n\nperformance of the composites [30-32].  One of the main concerns on the use of natural fibres in \n\ncomposites is their susceptibility to moisture absorption and the consequent effect on the physical and \n\nmechanical properties. The characteristics of that moisture absorption are influenced not only by the \n\nnature of the fibre and the matrix but also by the relative humidity and manufacturing process [33]. \n\nDespite these studies, the effect of cork on the mechanical behaviour of composites after water \n\nimmersion has not been addressed. Thus, the main objectives of this research are (i) identify a proper \n\nprocessing design to avoid degradation of the natural component and particle agglomeration, (ii) study \n\nthe effect of cork granulometry and the addition of coupling agent on the mechanical performance of \n\nthe composites, (iii) study the effect of adding cork on the thermal properties of the developed materials \n\nand (iv) access the maximum incorporation of cork in the polypropylene matrix without compromising \n\nthe processability of the final product. \n\n5.2 Experimental section \n\n5.2.1 Cork, polymer and coupling agents \n\nCork granules, with an average particle size 0.5-1 mm and specific weight of 166 \u00b1 21 kg.m-3, moisture \n\ncontent of ~7.5 % and a cork powder, with an average particle size &lt;500 \u00b5m, a specific weight of 157 \n\n\u00b1 2 kg m-3 and moisture content of ~5.4% were both supplied by Amorim Revestimentos S.A. (S. Paio \n\nOleiros, Portugal).  \n\nThe matrix was a polypropylene (PP) homopolymer, (1374 E2 from ExxonMobil, Germany), with a MFI \n\nof 20.8 g.10min-1 (200 \u00baC, 2.16 kg), and a melting point of 162 \u00baC, supplied by Pallmann \n\nMaschinenfabrik GmbH &amp; Co. (Germany) in the powder form. PP grafted with maleic anhydride (PP-g-\n\nMA), containing 0.5 to 1.0 wt% of maleic anhydride (Exxelor PO 1020), with MFI of 110 g.10min-1 (190 \n\n\u00baC, 1.2 kg), and a melting point of 156 \u00baC, was produced by ExxonMobil, Germany. Stearic acid in the \n\npowder form was supplied by Fluka.  \n\n5.2.2 Twin-screw extrusion compounding \n\nPrior to compounding, all natural raw materials were dried at 80 \u00baC during 24 h to stabilise the cork \n\nmoisture content. After this step, the moisture content, determined by oven-dry weight before \n\nprocessing, was found to be less than 2.5%.

The mould temperature was 180 \u00baC and the \n\nmaterial was kept 8 minutes in the mould without pressure followed by 2 minutes under 6 tones \n\npressure followed by a cooling period with water under pressure. \n\n5.2.5 Morphology \n\nThe distribution of cork particles on the PP matrix, after injection moulding, was observed on a \n\ntransmission optical microscope (Olympus BH-2) connected to a Leica DFC 280 digital camera and \n\ncorresponding software. To prepare the samples for the analyses, one slice with a thickness of 15 \u00b5m \n\nwas cut, using a Leitz 1401 microtome equipped with a glass slicing knife, from the longitudinal section \n\nof the tensile specimen. Each sample slice was placed between a microscope glass slide and cover \n\nglass. To prevent them from curling up or corrugating, Canada balsam was used as a fixing resin. All \n\nsamples were left to cure under a simple weight pressure during at least 12 h prior to analysis.  \n\n5.2.6 Physical testing \n\nThe physical tests involved accessing the dimensional stability by water absorption (WA), moisture \n\ncontent (MC) and density of the produced PP/Cork injection moulded composites and the plate \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties \n\n \n\n175 \n\ncontraction after compression moulding. The WA was measured according to the ASTM D 570. The \n\nspecimens, previously obtained by injection moulding, were dried at 70 \u00baC oven night in a vacuum oven \n\nand stabilized in a desiccator before undergo the tests.  \n\nThe WA was calculated by weighting the specimens before and after immersed in distilled water at \n\nroom temperature (23 \u00baC) and the tests were conducted up to 1344 h. The water absorption was \n\ncalculated according to the Equation 1: \n\n \n\n  (5.1) \n\n \n\nwhere Wa is the weight of the specimen after immersion (g) and Wb is the weight of the same specimen \n\nbefore immersion (g). Since cork is a natural material that presents some hygroscopic behavior, it was \n\nnecessary to determine the moisture content before WA testing. For that purpose, the specimens were \n\nweighed using an analytical balance before being placed in a vacuum oven at 50 \u00baC for 48 h. The \n\nspecimens were then removed from the oven and cooled and stabilized in a desiccator several days \n\nfollowed by reweighing of the specimens. The moisture content of the specimens was calculated as \n\nfollows: \n\n \n\n    (5.2) \n\n \n\nwhere Ww is the weight of the specimen before drying (g) and Wd is the weight of the sample after drying \n\n(g). Averages of five specimens were used for WA and MC measurements. \n\nThe density of the PP matrix and PP/cork injection moulded composites was determined according to \n\nthe standard ASTM D 792, using an analytical balance equipped with a stationary support for the \n\nimmersion vessel using liquid propanol. Averages of five specimens were measured per condition. \n\nThe plate contraction was accessed after the compression moulding process by comparing the \n\ndimensions of the metallic mould frame with the final dimensions of the 2 mm thick produced plates. \n\n5.2.7 Mechanical properties \n\nTensile properties of the polypropylene and PP/cork composites were measured using an Instron 4505 \n\nUniversal Testing Machine, (USA) according to the standard ASTM D 638. The tests were conducted \n\nusing a 1 kN load cell, with a gauge length of 20 mm and a crosshead speed of 5 mm.min?1 until \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties \n\n \n\n176 \n\nrupture. The tensile force was taken as the maximum stress in the stress-strain curve. Tensile modulus \n\nwas estimated from the initial slope of the stress\u2013strain curve (between 0.5 and 1% strain) using the \n\nlinear regression method. Samples were conditioned at room temperature for at least 48 h before \n\ntesting. The average and standard deviations were determined using at least 5 specimens per condition.  \n\nData were statistically analysed using IBM SPSS software v. 23.0 (Release 23.0 for Windows) to infer \n\nabout significant differences on the tensile properties of the developed composite materials. We first \n\napplied the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test to test the assumption of Normality and the results showed that the data \n\nwere not following a Normal distribution. Consequently, the Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test was used \n\nto compare the medians of the tensile modulus, tensile strength and maximum strain for the composite \n\nspecimens before and after immersion tests. Differences between groups were considered to be \n\nstatistically significant at a confidence level of 95.0 %. \n\n5.2.8 Thermal properties \n\nA Daventest (England) was used for obtaining data and allow determining melt flow index (MFI) of the \n\nneat polypropylene and of each composite material in the pellet form. Procedures were performed \n\naccording to ASTM D1238, using 210 \u00baC and 2.16 or 5 kg. Each condition was repeated once. \n\nDifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and oxidation induction time (OIT) measurements were \n\nperformed in a TA instrument DSC Q100 model (USA) equipment and using samples of 8\u201312 mg. DSC \n\nwas conducted at a heating rate of 10 \u00baC.min?1, under nitrogen atmosphere (flux of ca. 50 ml min?1). \n\nOnly the second run was analysed for melting temperature (Tm) and melting enthalpy (?Hm). The degree \n\nof crystallinity was calculated on the basis of a 100% crystalline PP a melting enthalpy of ?Hm\u00ba = 209 \n\nJ/g [34], according to the Eq. (3): \n\n \n\n    (5.3) \n\n \n\nwhere ?Hm is the apparent enthalpy of fusion per gram of composite and w is the weight fraction of \n\ncork in the composite. All the analysis were repeated at least once. \n\nOIT is a method to measure the stability of material against oxidation. Indium was used as calibration. \n\nThe samples were heated at a rate of 20 \u00baC.min-1 up to 200 \u00baC under nitrogen atmosphere. After 4 min \n\nat 200 \u00baC, the atmosphere was changed to oxygen (both gases at flux 50 ml.min-1) and oxidation \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties \n\n \n\n177 \n\ninduction time was measured during the isothermal period. The analyses were performed in three \n\nsamples per each condition. \n\nThermal conductivity, thermal resistance and sample thickness of the plates obtained by compression \n\nmoulding were measured in an Alambeta, Sensora HDH (Czech Republic), at 21 \u00baC. The principle of \n\nthe equipment is described in the literature [35]. In more detail, the experimental procedure consisted \n\non measuring the heat flow passing through the composite due to the difference of temperature where \n\nthe bottom measuring plate was set at 20\u00b0C and the measuring head (upper plate) was constant \n\nheated at 34 \u00b0C. All the measurements were repeated 3 times. The composite ability to conduct heat \n\nthrough its internal structure is given by the thermal conductivity (?) and is determined from the \n\nfollowing equation [36]: \n\n \n\n     (5.4) \n\n \n\nwhere, Q is the amount of conducted heat, F is the area through which the heat is conducted,  is the \n\ntime of heat conducting, ?T represents the drop of temperature and h the plate thickness obtained in \n\nthis study by compression moulding. \n\nThe thermal resistance is a property of materials and indicates how well a material insulates and it is \n\nrepresented by [36]: \n\n \n\n      (5.5) \n\n \n\nwhere, Rt is the thermal resistance and depends on the composite thickness h. \n\n \n\n5.3 Results and discussion \n\n5.3.1 Physical properties \n\n5.3.1.1 Water absorption and moisture content \n\nThe moisture content (MC) of the injection moulded specimens was determined before the water \n\nabsorption (WA) tests and the results are presented in Table 5.3. The results show that, the highest MC \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties \n\n \n\n178 \n\nwas 0.21 \u00b1 0.02%, value obtained the CPC 3 composition containing 30 wt.% of cork powder. For all \n\nother compositions the MC value was less than 0.16 \u00b1 0.02% being the reduced value of moisture \n\nobtain in the composites influenced by the processing methodology and the content of lignocellulosic \n\nmaterial in the composite. The impermeability of cork to liquids and gases, derived from its closed cell \n\nwalls that are made mainly of suberin, however it absorbs moisture at ambient relative humidity [12, \n\n13]. \n\nThe WA behaviour of the injection moulded specimens determined by equation 5.1 is shown in Figure \n\n5.3. The obtained results suggest that the water uptake depends of several parameters, including cork \n\namount and cork particle size as shown in Figure 5.3 a). The addition of cork particles increased the \n\nwater uptake of the composites when compared with the neat polymer, being the composition CPC 3 \n\ncontaining cork powder the one with higher WA. \n\nThis behaviour was independent of the cork particle size. However, the influence of cork particle size \n\nwas observed for the compositions prepared with higher cork content (30 wt.%), were the higher surface \n\narea of cork powder available to interact with water seems of significant importance. It was previously \n\nreported, that the contact angle of natural cork with water is around 84\u00ba and reduces with the time due \n\nto the WA [12]. We hypothesise that the hydrophilic polar hydroxyl and carboxylic groups present at the \n\ncork surface are responsible for the moisture uptake. Moreover, it was found that water absorption in \n\nlignocellulosic composites is mainly due to the presence of fine pores and hydrogen bonding sites in the \n\nbio-based component, gaps at the interfaces, and the micro-cracks in the matrix formed during the \n\ncompounding process [37].  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties \n\n \n\n179 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3.

For that purpose, the compositions containing cork \n\npowder (15 wt.%) and different amounts of coupling agent were selected. From the obtained results is \n\nclear that the water uptake was reduced with the addition of coupling agent. In the case of PP-g-MA, the \n\ndecrease of WA was more pronounced with the increase of the coupling agent content. The functional \n\ngroups [-(CO)2 O-] of maleic anhydride interact manly with the hydroxyl groups (-OH) [38] present in the \n\nlignocellulosic materials increasing the interfacial adhesion and reducing the available polar groups at \n\nthe particle surface to absorb water. In the case of the stearic acid it is reported that the carboxyl group \n\nof stearic acid reacts with the hydrophilic hydroxyl groups of the natural fibre and improves water \n\nresistance properties [39]. The improvement on the compatibility between cork-polymer may result in a \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties \n\n \n\n181 \n\nreduction of possible micro voids resulting from the processing and consequently on a decrease on the \n\nWA. It should be highlighted that, even for the high cork content of 30 wt.%, the WA was very low being \n\n2.11 \u00b1 0.17 % the highest value after 1344 h of immersion. \n\n5.3.1.2 Density of plates and of specimens \n\nThe effect of the processing method, type and amount of cork particles on the final density of the \n\ndifferent compositions was analysed, see results in Figure 5.4.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.4. Density of the different PP/cork composites after injection and compression moulding \n\nprocesses. \n\n \n\nConsidering the density of the neat polypropylene 896 kg/m3, it was observed that the injection \n\nmoulded composite specimens exhibit higher density when compared with the compression moulded \n\nones, probably due to the higher pressures (per unit of volume) involved during the injection moulding \n\nprocess (see Table 5.2). Unexpectedly, it was also observed that, for both processing methods, \n\nformulations containing higher amount of cork (30 wt.%) have shown higher density. For both cases, \n\nthis behaviour was more evident on the composites prepared using cork powder (985 kg/m3) than in \n\nthe ones prepared with cork granules (967 kg/m3), representing an increase on the density of 10 and \n\n8% respectively. The presence and the amount of coupling agent during injection moulding promoted a \n\nsmall reduction on the composite density. This occurs probably due to the additional distributive \n\ncapacity of the coupling agent that enhanced the dispersion of the cork particles during the extrusion \n\nprocess.  \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties \n\n \n\n182 \n\nApplying compression moulding in the presence of coupling agent it was observed resulted in a small \n\nincreasing on the composite plate\u2019s density, especially when using cork powder. As explained before, \n\nthis could be due to a possible reduction of micro-voids that may occur during this static process. \n\nHowever the selected pressure applied in compression moulding enables to take some advantage of \n\nthis natural cellular material in terms of final density of the composites as compared with the neat \n\npolypropylene. The increasing on density was also observed for the two additional formulations (CPC 14 \n\nand CPC 15) using higher cork amounts (50 and 70 wt.%) respectively. These compositions represent \n\nbio-based composites containing 85 and 93% of cork powder in volume. As presented in Table 5.4 \n\nusing 70 wt.% of cork powder the final composite plate density was 1044 kg/m3.  \n\nOne possible explanation is the densification of the cork particles due to the high pressures involve in \n\nboth processing methods. Cork is a light weight material (see Figure 5.2 c)) and it is composed by a \n\nclosed cellular structure. The density of the cork cell wall was never experimentally measured but it was \n\nestimated by the density of the different polymeric components to be 1150 kg/m3 [12, 17]. This may \n\nexplain the effect of some densification that occurs using lignocellulosic materials such as cork \n\ncombined with polyolefins after being processed by two melting processing steps.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties \n\n \n\n183 \n\nT\nab\n\nle\n 5\n\n.4\n. \nP\n\nro\np\ner\n\ntie\ns \n\nof\n t\nh\ne \n\nm\nat\n\nri\nx \n\nan\nd\n o\n\nf \nth\n\ne \nco\n\nrk\n c\n\nom\np\nos\n\nite\n m\n\nat\ner\n\nia\nls\n\n a\nft\ner\n\n t\nh\ne \n\nin\nd\nic\n\nat\ned\n\n m\nel\n\nt \nba\n\nse\nd\n p\n\nro\nce\n\nss\nes\n\n. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1\n In\n\nd\nic\n\nat\nes\n\n t\nh\ne \n\non\nse\n\nt \nfo\n\nr \ncr\n\nys\nta\n\nlli\nza\n\ntio\nn\n t\n\nem\np\ner\n\nat\nu\nre\n\n (\nTc\n\n);\n c\n\nry\nst\n\nal\nliz\n\nat\nio\n\nn\n e\n\nn\nth\n\nal\np\ny \n\n(?\nH\n\nc);\n m\n\nel\ntin\n\ng \nte\n\nm\np\ner\n\nat\nu\nre\n\n (\nTm\n\n);\n m\n\nel\ntin\n\ng \nen\n\nth\nal\n\np\ny \n\n(?\nH\n\nm\n);\n c\n\nry\nst\n\nal\nlin\n\nity\n (\n?\n\nc) \nan\n\nd \n\nox\nid\n\nat\nio\n\nn\n i\nn\nd\nu\nct\n\nio\nn\n t\n\nim\ne \n\n(O\nIT\n\non\nse\n\nt) \nd\net\n\ner\nm\n\nin\ned\n\n b\ny \n\nD\nS\nC\n\n; \n2\n T\n\nh\ner\n\nm\nal\n\n c\non\n\nd\nu\nct\n\niv\nity\n\n a\nn\nd\n t\n\nh\ner\n\nm\nal\n\n r\nes\n\nis\nta\n\nn\nce\n\n d\net\n\ner\nm\n\nin\ned\n\n a\nt \n\n3\n4\n \u00ba\n\nC\n; \n\n(*\n) \n\nn\not\n\n p\nos\n\nsi\nb\nle\n\n t\no \n\nd\net\n\ner\nm\n\nin\ne;\n\n (\n) \n\nva\nlu\n\nes\n o\n\nf \nap\n\np\nar\n\nen\nt \n\nen\nth\n\nal\np\ny \n\nof\n m\n\nel\ntin\n\ng \np\ner\n\n g\nra\n\nm\n o\n\nf \np\nol\n\nym\ner\n\n ?\nH\n\n\u00b4\nm\n =\n\n ?\nH\n\nm\n /\n\n (\n1\n - \n\nw\n),\n\n w\nh\ner\n\ne \nw\n\n is\n t\nh\ne \n\nco\nrk\n\n f\nra\n\nct\nio\n\nn\n. \n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties \n\n \n\n184 \n\n5.3.1.3 Plate contraction \n\nThe compression moulded plates were used to determine the contraction behaviour of the different \n\ncompositions and the obtained results are indicated in Table 5.4. As expect, the 2 mm thickness plates \n\nprepared using only the neat polypropylene presented a high contraction of 4.0 % in the mould walls. By \n\nincreasing cork concentration, the contraction was proportionally reduced, being 2.2% for the polymer-\n\ncork powder (50-50) wt.% composition CPC 14. Moreover, increasing the cork particle size reduced the \n\ncontraction in the mould. This are an important results for the design of composite materials since the \n\nuse of low amount of cork particles can contribute for increasing the dimensional stability of the final \n\nproduct. \n\n5.3.1.4 Composite aesthetics \n\nThe aesthetic properties of the produced PP/cork composite plates with 5 wt.% of cork and 2 mm \n\nthickness, obtained by compression moulding, are presented in Figure 5.5.  \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 5.5. Visual aspect of 2 mm thick PP/cork composite plates formed by compression moulding: a) \n\nCPC 1 containing PP with 5 wt.% of cork powder and b) CPC 4 containing PP with 5 wt.% of granulated \n\ncork. \n\n \n\nIt was observed that both cork powder and granulated cork acts as a pigment promoting a brown colour \n\n(Figure 5.5 a). On the other hand, when granulated cork is used (Figure 5.5 b), it is possible to observe \n\na homogeneous distribution of the cork granules promoting a better aesthetic on the final material. \n\nTaking aesthetics and environmental awareness as the main selection indices for a specific application, \n\nwe can suggest that cork is one of the highest ranking candidates to be used in the development of \n\nsustainable materials. \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties \n\n \n\n185 \n\n5.3.2 Composite morphology \n\nTransmission optical microscopy was employed to evaluate the cork particles distribution on the \n\nPP/cork composite specimens. Figure 5.6 shows the bright field micrographs from the longitudinal \n\nsections (flow direction) of injection moulded samples, revealing good dispersion and distribution of the \n\ncork particles, also promoted by the twin-screw extrusion process. A few dark particles were observed; \n\nhowever, the used cork particles also present some dark brown particles as shown in Figure 5.2 a) and \n\nb) that can be resulted from the wood bark of the tree and not resulted from a thermal degradation \n\nprocess of cork. \n\nIncreasing the cork bio-based content up to 30 wt% (Figure 5.6 d and g) no particle aggregation was \n\nobserved, maintaining the homogeneous cork distribution and dispersion. It has been reported that one \n\nof the main problems in processing wood-thermoplastic composites is the tendency of untreated wood \n\nto form large aggregates, due to a high intramolecular bonding among the fibres [11]. Therefore, this \n\nmay be a distinguishable feature of using cork if the proper extrusion conditions are used. \n\nSince cork is a compressive foam material and PP matrix presents higher hardness, it was also \n\nexpected to see some voids at the polymer-cork interface due to the cutting process during samples\u2019 \n\npreparation. On the contrary, the bright field microscopy micrographs showed a good cohesion of the \n\ncork particles in the structure film prepared for microscopy, revealing a good interfacial adhesion \n\nbetween cork and the PP matrix independently of the cork particle size or cork weight fraction or the \n\nuse of coupling agent present in the composite. This absence of gaps or voids between cork-polymer \n\nwithout coupling agent may also be supported by the cellular structure at the cork surface allowing \n\nhigher attachment of the PP during the melting compounding. The result also supports the low water \n\nabsorption results of the composites containing cork. Several studies [11, 30, 31] using other \n\nlignocellulosic fibres or fillers without coupling agents showed lower interfacial adhesion with the \n\npresence of gaps between the matrix-fibre system at this magnification. Figure 5.6 b) and f) shows \n\npolarized light microscopic (PLM) micrographs of the PP/cork composites containing 5 wt%. of cork. \n\nThese PLM images reveal a shell and a subshell that is formed due to a supercooling effect resulting \n\nfrom the low temperature of the mould during the injection moulding process. Moreover, in this region \n\nof the specimen were the composite material is in direct contact with the mould, it was found that cork \n\nparticles are highly aligned in the longitudinal direction, though the flow direction, as indicated in Figure \n\n5.6 b). No significant differences on the cork distribution were observed in the presence of the coupling \n\nagent PP-g-MA or with the stearic acid. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties \n\n \n\n186 \n\nC\nP\n\nC\n 1\n\n \n\na)\n\n \n\nC\nP\n\nC\n 1\n\n \n\nb)\n\n \n\nC\nP\n\nC\n 2\n\n \n\n    \n\nc)\n\n \n\nC\nP\n\nC\n 3\n\n \n\nd)\n\n \n\nC\nP\n\nC\n 4\n\n \n\n     \n\ne)\n\n \n\nC\nP\n\nC\n 4\n\n \n\nf)\n\n \n\nC\nP\n\nC\n 6\n\n \n\n    \n\ng)\n\n \n\nC\nP\n\nC\n 7\n\n \n\nh)\n\n \n\nC\nP\n\nC\n 1\n\n0\n \n\n     \n\ni)\n\n \n\nC\nP\n\nC\n 1\n\n3\n \n\nj)\n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties \n\n \n\n187 \n\nFigure 5.6.

The results are plotted on Figure 5.8 a, c and e). The addition of \n\nlow amounts of cork (i.e. 5 wt.%) reinforced the stiffness of the polypropylene in 10%, while the use of \n\ncork up to 15 wt.% does not affect negatively the tensile modulus of the neat PP. When the cork content \n\nwas increased to 30 wt.% an opposite effect was observed decreasing the composite stiffness. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties \n\n \n\n188 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 5.8.

The decrease in tensile strength is partially due to the inherent incompatibility between \n\ncork particles and PP matrix.  As the load is applied to the composite material, the lack of interfacial \n\nadhesion between cork particles and the matrix will limit the load transfer process, thus, resulting in a \n\ndecrease in the tensile properties. Additionally, the mechanical properties of cork under tensile load are \n\nlower when compared with the polypropylene matrix contributing to a diminishing of the tensile strength. \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties \n\n \n\n189 \n\n5.3.3.2 Effect of PP-g-MA and stearic acid  \n\nIt is well known that the fibre\u2013matrix interaction has a significant effect in the final mechanical \n\nproperties of polymer composites. To improve the bonding strength between cork particles and the \n\npolymeric matrix, polypropylene graft maleic anhydride (PP-g-MA) and stearic acid were tested as \n\ncoupling agents. The results are presented in Figure 5.7, Figure 5.8 and summarized in Table 5.3. The \n\neffect of PP-g-MA on the tensile modulus is shown in Figure 5.8 b). The stiffness of the composite \n\npresents a small improvement for the granulated cork while in the powder form a small decrease on the \n\nstiffness was obtained. Increasing the coupling agent up to 8 wt.% the composites exhibited similar \n\nstiffness when compared to the control specimens (CPC 2 and CPC 5) containing 15 wt.% of cork \n\nwithout coupling agent. Tensile strength of the composites was significantly improved with the addition \n\nof the PP-g-MA (Figure 5.7 b) and Figure 5.8 d)), resulting in a composites with higher strength and \n\ntoughness. Additionally, the increase on tensile strength was not proportional to the increase of the \n\namount of coupling agent used indicating that the use of PP-g-MA in 8 wt.% does not promoted a \n\nrelevant increase on the tensile strength as compared with the composites using 4 wt.% of PP-g-MA. \n\nThese results suggest that the addition of coupling agent based on maleic anhydride (MA) improves the \n\ninterfacial adhesion between both components promoting the load transfer from the matrix trough the \n\ncork particles resulting in an increase of the tensile strength. As it was pointed before, the MA interact \n\nmanly with the hydroxyl groups of the lignocellulosic materials increasing the interfacial bonding of PP-\n\ncork, which leads to a better stress transfer from the polymer to the cork resulting on the increase of \n\nthe tensile properties. The maximum strain in PP/Cork (85/15) wt.% was also considerably improved \n\nwith the addition of coupling agent (see Figure 5.8 d). \n\nOn the contrary, the use of stearic acid as presented in Table 5.3 does not influence the tensile strength, \n\nreduced the tensile modulus and promoted just a slight increase on the maximum strain at break. \n\nSimilar effect has been reported on the properties of PP/wood flour composites [40], where the stearic \n\nacid slight increased the strain at break and promoted better homogeneity and processability. In this \n\nstudy, it was also observed that the addition of stearic acid acted as a release mould agent during the \n\ninjection moulding. The use of solid lubricants is recommended to reduce the friction coefficient of the \n\nnatural fibre materials [41].  \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties \n\n \n\n190 \n\n5.3.3.3 Effect of cork particle size \n\nThe effect of cork particle size on the tensile properties of the PP/cork composites can be observed in \n\nFigure 5.8. In the absence of coupling agent and independently of the cork particle size, by increasing \n\nthe cork content resulted in a reduction of the mechanical performance. Small differences were \n\nobserved particularly the more pronounced reduction in the stiffness when it was used 30 wt.% of cork \n\npowder (Figure 5.8 a)). An opposite effect in the presence of PP-g-MA (Figure 5.8 b)) was observed. \n\nHigher content of coupling agent of 8 wt.% may contribute to reinforce the PP/Cork composite stiffness. \n\nThe increase on tensile strength in the presence of coupling agent occurred independently of the cork \n\nparticle size, however more significant in formulations prepared using cork powder. Furthermore, in the \n\npresence of 2 wt.% of coupling agent the maximum strain at break maintains (Figure 5.8 f) while the \n\nuse of cork granules decreased the maximum strain in 60%. The result can be ascribed by the lower \n\nparticle size of cork meaning a higher surface area of the bio-based fraction available to interact with \n\nthe polypropylene matrix. It is expected that the use of coupling agent reduces the viscosity of the neat \n\npolypropylene increasing the contact of the thermoplastic with the cork particles and thus promoting \n\nhigher tensile strength and strain at break in the final composite specimens. \n\n5.3.3.4 Ashby diagram \n\nThe Figure 5.9 shows the Ashby plot presenting the specific maximum tensile strength against the \n\nspecific tensile modulus of the PP and the PP/cork composites. It also  includes the tensile properties \n\nreported for cork (good quality), being the tensile modulus of 30.8 MPa, the fracture stress of 1.05 MPa \n\nand the density ranging from 0.148 to 0.178 g.cm-3 [42].  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties \n\n \n\n191 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.9. Ashby plot presenting the specific maximum tensile strength against the specific tensile \n\nmodulus of the polypropylene (PP) and the PP/cork composites obtained by extrusion followed by \n\ninjection moulding. \n\n \n\nBy normalizing the tensile properties by the density of each processed material two distinct regions \n\nwere observed for the composites, being the region (1) containing the composites without coupling \n\nagent and with higher cork weight content (15 and 30 wt.%) and the region (2) the composites with \n\ncoupling agent or with only 5 wt.% of cork. The addition of 5 wt.% of cork promotes a reinforcement on \n\nthe PP matrix increasing the stiffness. Similar result was obtained using higher content of the coupling \n\nagent. The mechanical properties of the composites prepared with cork powder present higher variation \n\nas compared with the composites containing cork granules. However, higher tensile strength was \n\nachieved using cork powder with coupling agent. This result reinforces the idea of the lower the cork \n\nparticle size, the higher the surface area and the interaction with the matrix due to the presence of PP-g-\n\nMA, resulting in higher mechanical properties.  \n\n \n\n5.3.3.5 Dry and wet tensile properties \n\nMechanical tests were performed for all the specimens before and after water absorption studies.  \n\nFigure 5.10 compares the tensile properties in terms of modulus, maximum strength and maximum \n\nstrain of the PP/Cork composites before and after immersion in water during 1344 hours. The used \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties \n\n \n\n192 \n\nKruskal-Wallis statistical test compares the medians of tensile properties of the composites. p values \n\nless than 0.05, indicate statistically significant differences (*) between the medians at a confidence level \n\nof 95 %. In general, the mechanical properties are very similar before and after water saturation. This \n\nresult is a clear advantage of cork composites since they can be used in wet conditions maintaining \n\nmechanical performance similar to dry environments. However, some statistical significant differences \n\nwere observed and it is interesting to notice that, for several composite compositions, the ultimate \n\ntensile strength of wet samples is higher than that for dry samples, as shown in Figure 5.10.  b).This \n\ncould be due to the fact that high amounts of water causes swelling of the bio-based material, which \n\ncould fill the spaces between the cork and the polymer matrix interface and eventually could lead to an \n\nincrease in the mechanical properties of the composites, as reported in studies of natural fibre-matrix \n\ncomposites [33, 43]. \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.10. Tensile properties of the polypropylene (PP) and the PP/cork composites before and after \n\nwater absorption tests. (*) denotes significant statistical differences for 0.05 of confidence in pairwise \n\ncomparisons between dry and wet specimens. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties \n\n \n\n193 \n\nOn the contrary, it was observed a decrease on the tensile strain for the wet specimens (Figure 5.10 c). \n\nThis effect is more evident for the composites containing low amounts of cork. Cork as a hydrophobic \n\ncharacter with close cellular structure and is used as a sealant material [13, 14]; however it absorbs \n\nmoisture, presenting low permeability to water. Once the moisture penetrates inside the cork particles \n\ntends to swell and after the saturation period it occurs an additional weakness of the cork-matrix \n\ninterface which results in a clear loss on the maximum tensile strain. \n\n5.3.4 Thermal Properties \n\n5.3.4.1 Effect of the compounding method on the composite melt flow behaviour \n\nThe effect of cork addition on the properties of the extruded composite pellets was accessed by means \n\nof melt flow index (MFI) and the results are presented in Table 5.4. Effective mixing during \n\ncompounding is important to achieve a good dispersion and distribution of cork and, consequently to \n\noptimize the composite properties. The addition of 5 wt.% of cork to the PP matrix exhibits a reduction \n\naround 50% of the MFI. As expected, this result indicates that by increasing the cork content the MFI \n\ntends to reduce, revealing the higher shear forces that occur during the extrusion process. However, for \n\nthe same amount of cork, the presence of PP-g-MA and stearic acid reduces the viscosity promoting the \n\nmixability of the cork with the PP and the consequent increase on the MFI. Comparing all composition, \n\nit was observed a correlation between the cork particle size and the MFI values, being the lower the \n\nparticle size the smaller is the MFI. For the same amount, there is higher number of cork particles in \n\nthe powder form per volume as compared with the cork granules therefore, more interfaces between \n\ncork-matrix to restrict the flow during the extrusion and consequent reduction of the melt flow index. \n\nWhen a high content of cork (50 to 70 wt.%) is used the viscosity of the composite increases even more, \n\nresulting in processing difficulties justifying the option in this work to compound the CPC 14 and CPC \n\n15 compositions without die. In addition, agglomeration of the cork as result of poor dispersion may \n\nalso occur. \n\n5.3.4.2 Crystallization and melting temperature \n\nThe thermal stability of composites was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and the \n\nobtained results are presented in Figure 5.11 and in the Table 5.4.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties \n\n \n\n194 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.11. DSC curves obtained during cooling of PP and its PP/cork powder composites. \n\n \n\nThe differences to the neat PP were more relevant when the crystallization temperatures (Tc) were \n\ndetermined and compared from the first cooling cycling. The DSC curves show the effect of the cork \n\npowder on the crystallization of PP/cork composites. The PP/cork composites showed higher Tc than \n\nthe neat PP being the increasing proportional to the cork weight fraction up to 50 wt.%. This result \n\nsuggests that the crystallization process is favoured by the presence of cork particles. This effect is \n\nattributed to the nucleation effect of the cork: the particles act as sites for heterogeneous nucleation \n\nthat induce the crystallization of the matrix. The nucleating ability of cork was also observed in a \n\nprevious study [23] by optical microscopy and DSC using different cork powders, a by-product from \n\ncork industry, combined with polyolefins after pultrusion process. The addition of coupling agent based \n\non maleic anhydride contributed also to increase the crystallization rate. This result implies that the \n\ncoupling agent acted as a precursor increasing the crystallization. A previous study suggest that the \n\ncrystallization of PP-g-MA is slightly hfaster than that of PP due to a possible chain branching of maleic \n\nanhydride and the better dispersion of the PP-g-MA in the polymer matrix [44]. Moreover, the results \n\nindicates that processing these PP/Cork composites needs less moulding time and energy than the \n\nneat PP. Table 5.4 also shows the melting temperature (Tm), melting enthalpy (?Hm) corrected by the \n\ncork content, and percentage of crystallinity (?c) that corresponds to the values obtained in the second \n\nheating scans of the neat PP and PP/Cork composites containing 5, 15 and 30 wt.% of cork. The \n\naddition of the natural cork to PP has no significant effect on the Tm, and no correlation of the results \n\nwith the cork loading can be established. The increase on the cork content up to 30 wt.% on the PP \n\nmatrix promoted a small increase on the crystallinity (?c) of the composites independently of the cork \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties \n\n \n\n195 \n\nparticle size. A possible explanation for this observation is that, when cork is introduced into the PP \n\nmatrix, the crystallinity of the polymer fraction increases, as a result new crystalline zones are formed \n\naround the cork particles through spherulitic crystallization on their surfaces. By increasing the cork \n\ncontent up to 50 wt.% the composite crystallinity (CPC 14) decreased to 42.5%. This result indicated \n\nthat the crystallinity was reduced in 5.1% as compared to neat PP, probably due to the higher content of \n\namorphous components that chemically constitute the cork. The presence of PP-g-MA in the \n\ncomposites seems to have influence on the enthalpy values: it was observed that the increase of \n\ncoupling agent was followed by a slight increase on the crystallinity. This result was exhibited in all \n\nPP/Cork composites containing coupling agent. Thus, the increase on the crystallinity is also dependent \n\nof the degree of compatibility between the PP matrix and the cork. This behaviour was also observed in \n\nsome different few natural fibres in the presence of polyolefin grafted with maleic anhydride [44-46] and \n\nsupports the good interaction between the cork and the PP matrix in the presence of PP-g-MA as \n\ncoupling agent observed in this study.  \n\n5.3.4.3 Oxidation induction time \n\nThermoplastics have points in its chain that are susceptible to the thermal oxidation during the \n\nprocessing and end use. On the other hand, lignocellulosic materials, such as cork, are sensitive to \n\ntemperature and high shear rates during compounding that may cause degradation and consequent \n\nchanges in the mechanical performance. The thermo-oxidative stability of the neat PP and the PP/cork \n\ncomposites in oxygen atmosphere was assessed by determining the oxidation induction time (OIT) at \n\nelevated temperatures, under isothermal conditions see results in Figure 5.12 and Table 5.4. The onset \n\nof oxidation on the matrix PP was detected immediately (after 2.7 min) as the atmosphere was changed \n\nfrom nitrogen to oxygen. Comparing with the matrix the increase in the OIT of the composites suggests \n\nthat PP is stabilized by the addition of cork. The OIT values of the composites containing cork powder \n\nwere considerably higher than the composites with granulated cork. It was found that increasing the \n\ncork content up to 30 wt.%, provides a higher antioxidative protection. The best results of OIT were \n\nobtained using cork powder (37.4 min), representing 12.9 times higher than the neat PP. This \n\nbehaviour might be ascribed due to the higher surface area of the well dispersed cork particles available \n\nto interact with the matrix in combination with the higher composite density. \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties \n\n \n\n196 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.12. Thermal oxidative stability of the neat polypropylene (PP) and PP/cork composites at 200 \n\n\u00baC revealing the onset of decomposition.  \n\n \n\nThe higher density of the PP/cork composite material will block the access of oxygen and slows the \n\noxidative degradation.  The literature also point some studies were lignins, obtained from different \n\nprocesses, were added in low amounts to stabilize polypropylene against thermoxidation [47, 48] since \n\nthey can impart antioxidant properties. Chemically, cork presents phenolic compounds that are present \n\nin the suberin and lignin that may also contribute for this antioxidant protection. In addition, cork \n\nextractives are non-structural organic components of the cork cell wall around up to 18 wt.% and among \n\nother components presents phenolic compounds [12] that might be released during the extrusion and \n\nmixed with the matrix contributing also to this result. It has been reported that the use of some natural \n\nfibres does not promote higher antioxidant effect in thermoplastics [26]. Nevertheless, this study shows \n\nthat the two factors that are relevant to prolong the lifetime of the PP/cork composites are i) the \n\npresence of antioxidants that blocks the free radicals and ii) the composite density that may control the \n\namount of oxygen into the composite. However, it is expected that the use of polymers containing \n\nantioxidant or thermal stabilizer compounds in their composition present higher oxidation stability than \n\ncork can provide. In that case, the stabilizer molecules are slowly released with time, thus, contributing \n\nto an extended stabilizer lifetime. It can be suggested that cork will affect positively the behaviour of the \n\nthermoplastic materials preventing the oxidative degradation of the polypropylene during compounding \n\nand subsequent service. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties \n\n \n\n197 \n\n5.3.4.4 Thermal resistance and thermal conductivity \n\nThermal conductivity (TC) is a measure of the heat flux that will flow through the material if a certain \n\ntemperature gradient exists over the material [49]. The small cells are an important feature of cork. The \n\ncells are much smaller than those in the polymeric foamed materials providing excellent insulating \n\nproperties to the material [17]. The TC of the produced plates, as compared with the PP matrix, is \n\npresented in Table 5.4 and Figure 5.13. The results have shown that TC maintains or decreases only \n\nfor the composites up to 5 wt.% of cork content. All the PP/cork composites present low TC, however, \n\nsignificant differences were observed in the composites. The results show that the TC increases with the \n\nincrease of the cork weight fraction and the relationship being the stronger the smaller the filler particle \n\nsize. The increase of TC of the PP/cork can be explained by the densification of cork on the composites \n\nafter the two melt based processes. First, the higher shear forces during the extrusion and second due \n\nto the applied pressure in compression moulding. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.13. Thermal conductivity in function of the density of the plates obtained by compression \n\nmoulding for the PP and PP/cork composites without coupling agent. \n\n \n\nThe plot of TC against the composite density shown in Figure 5.13 gave the regression value (R2) to be \n\n0.9975 for the cork powder composite plates, which indicated a good correlation between these two \n\nproperties. Furthermore, the coefficient value was found to be positive indicating an increase in the TC \n\nwith the increase of the composite density. Increasing the cork particle size (formulations CPC 4 to CPC \n\n6) was not possible to infer significant differences between the cork particle size, since the compositions \n\ncontaining 15 and 30 wt.% tends to follow the same linear regression. The only outlier point was CPC 4 \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties \n\n \n\n198 \n\nthat contains only 5 wt.% of cork. In cellular materials different type of heat flow through the material \n\ncan occur. The flow by conduction depends only on the amount of solid in the foam and not depends \n\non the cell size. The flow by convection depends on the cell size, however for cells less than 1 mm in \n\nsize, convection does not contribute significantly. Finally, the flow by radiation, also depends on the cell \n\nsize: the smaller the cells, the more time the heat has to be absorbed and reradiated, and the lower is \n\nthe rate of flow [17].  \n\nOn the contrary, the thermal resistance (TR) shows an opposite effect as presented in Table 5.4 and is \n\nalso dependent of the plate thickness as presented in the equation 5.5. For the CPC 15, condition \n\ncontaining 70 wt.% of cork powder the TR is half as compared with the neat polypropylene, due to a \n\nhigh densification of the cork powder in the matrix were the TC increased 89% as compared with the \n\nneat PP. This may be an advantage in applications were the material need to promote the heat transfer, \n\nsuch as in radiating floors where these PP/cork composites can be used as structural layer or in \n\nhardware for electronics. Being cork an excellent thermal insulator this result was not expected, \n\nhowever this study shows that by playing with the cork weight fraction it is possible to increase or \n\ndecrease the TR of the composite material. \n\n5.4 Conclusions \n\nPolypropylene-cork (PP/cork) composites were produced using twin-screw extruder followed by injection \n\nor compression moulding process. The effect of cork fraction and particle size and the use of coupling \n\nagent on the mechanical and thermo-physical properties PP/cork composites were investigated. The \n\nimportant results are summarized as follows: \n\n(1) The PP/cork composites exhibit reduced water uptake and the increase of cork fraction, \n\nincreases the water absorption up to 2.3 wt.% after a period of 1344 hours. The increase of \n\nparticle size of the cork tends to decrease the water uptake and the addition of coupling agent \n\nsignificantly reduces the composite water absorption. \n\n(2) The morphology of the PP/cork composites evaluated by optical microscopy revealed good \n\ndispersion and distribution of cork due to the twin-screw extrusion process, promoting good \n\naesthetic characteristics. \n\n(3) The PP/cork composites exhibit higher density than the neat polypropylene and increases with \n\nthe higher incorporation of cork. The use of coupling agent induces a slight decrease on the \n\ndensity due a better dispersion of the cork on the matrix. \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties \n\n \n\n199 \n\n(4) The tensile properties revealed a small reinforcement of around 10% in the stiffness provide by \n\ncork fraction 5 wt.%. For higher values an expected drop on the tensile properties was observed. \n\nThe mechanical properties were enhanced by the addition of polypropylene graft maleic \n\nanhydride (PP-g-MA) preferably in terms of tensile strength and maximum strain, while the \n\nstearic acid promoted a slight increase on the maximum strain and acted as a release mould \n\nagent without significant negative effect on the mechanical performance. \n\n(5) Regarding the thermal properties, the PP/Cork composites had higher crystallization \n\ntemperatures than neat PP, and their thermal stability was similar that of PP. Cork and PP-g-MA \n\nacts as nucleating agent during the crystallization process and does not affect the thermal \n\nstability of the composites. Cork promoted a small increase on the composite crystallinity upto \n\n30 wt.%, however the enhancement was also dependent of the degree of compatibility between \n\nthe PP matrix and the cork. \n\n(6) Cork promotes an antioxidant effect to the polypropylene increasing the time to oxidation. \n\nReducing the cork particle size and consequently increasing the surface area of the particles \n\nand the composite density contributes to a higher thermal-oxidative protection. Using 30 wt.% of \n\ncork powder the oxidation was delayed 12.9 times as compared with the neat PP. \n\n(7) The thermal conductivity of the plates increases with the increase of the cork weight fraction \n\ndue to the increase of the density promoted by the addition of cork. This higher capacity for \n\nheat transfer may result in new potential applications for cork composites. \n\n(8) The addition of cork to the thermoplastic reduces considerably the viscosity and consequently \n\nthe melt flow index (MFI), while the addition of the coupling agent PP-g-MA to the polyolefin-cork \n\nsystem promotes opposite effect improving mixability. \n\n(9) The maximum incorporation of cork to produce pellets was 70 wt.% (93% in volume) using cork \n\npowder compounded in a twin-screw extruder without die. \n\nIn areas were environmentally concern, aesthetics, reduced plastic touch and construction capability \n\nare required, the composites containing cork constitute a viable and interesting possibility. Regarding \n\nthese properties, the applications for the developed cork composites may include furniture, flooring and \n\ninsulation systems, hardware for electronics, toys for children, outdoor systems, in low content for \n\nautomotive interior applications, among other sustainable applications. \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties \n\n \n\n200 \n\n5.5 References \n\n[1] Vaidya UK, Chawla KK.

Cork is the outer \n\nbark of the Oak tree Quercus suber L. [4], where the harvesting of cork is a natural, renewable process \n\nthat reduces subsequent carbon footprints. During industrial cork processing, up to 30 % results in sub-\n\nproducts such as cork powder, which is used in small amounts low value added applications. Cork-\n\npolymer composites (CPC) are usually prepared through melt based technologies. Increasing the \n\npercentage of cork in the composite without compromising the overall properties is seen as a desirable \n\nroute towards sustainability. However, commodity thermoplastic matrices, such as polyethylene and \n\npolypropylene, are chemically incompatible with lignocellulosic materials, requiring the incorporation of \n\ncoupling agents to improve interfacial adhesion. The addition  of functionalized polymers containing \n\nmaleic anhydride (MA) groups  during  compounding showed to be an effective method to improve \n\ninterfacial bonding, even when  using different cork qualities [5, 6]. The typical chemical composition of \n\ncork is about 40% of suberin, up to 22% of lignin, 18% of polysaccharides and up to 15% of other \n\nextractives [4, 7]. Suberin and lignin are thus the main constituents and in combination with  a closed \n\ncellular morphology account for cork\u2019s unique properties, namely excellent insulation characteristics, \n\nlow density and permeability, low thermal conductivity, high energy absorption, resilience, near-zero \n\nPoisson coefficient and high friction coefficient [7, 8]. Suberin is a natural biopolymer typically found in \n\nthe cell walls of plants [9]. Cork suberin is constituted by a polyester structure of long chain fatty acids, \n\nhydroxyl and phenolic acids, linked by ester groups, with ferulic acid acting as a bridge between the \n\naromatic and the aliphatic domains [10, 11]. Whether the aromatic domain is part of the suberin \n\nmolecule is still a matter of debate [12]. The alkaline depolymerisation in an organic solvent results in \n\nthe release of the aliphatic constituents through cleavage of the ester linkages and transesterification \n\n[11, 13, 14]. Full characterization of cork lignin is still incomplete because of the complex relation \n\nbetween true lignin and the aromatic fraction of suberin. Nevertheless, Marques et al. [15-17] found \n\nthat cork is composed of a G type lignin with 94-96% guaiacyl, less than 3-5% syringyl and 2-3% \n\nhydroxyphenyl units [18]. In a previous study, the potential of suberin and chemically modified suberin \n\nto promote adhesion between low density polyethylene and cork was demonstrated [19]. Lignin has \n\nbeen proposed to reinforce the mechanical properties of composites [20, 21],  to promote adhesion in \n\nnatural fibre composites [22], or, in combination with a coupling agent, to improve mechanical \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Functionalized cork-polymer composites (CPC) by reactive extrusion using suberin and \n\nlignin from cork as coupling agents \n\n \n\n208 \n\nperformance [21, 23]. In all cases, high amounts of lignin or the addition of a coupling agent were \n\nnecessary to reinforce the composites.  \n\nThis work focus on the development of cork-polymer composites (CPC) using suberin and lignin  as bio-\n\nbased coupling agents through a reactive extrusion (REX) process, in order to overcome with \n\nenvironmental benefits the insufficient adhesion between cork and a high density polyethylene (HDPE)  \n\nmatrix. REX has the capability of functionalize, prepare the composite and produce pellets in a single \n\nstep. No environmental or health hazardous solvents are used, low investment costs and high \n\nproduction yields are obtained [18, 24]. Initiators are usually required, the most widely used in grafting \n\nreactions being organic peroxides, including benzoyl peroxide (BPO). The work investigates for the first \n\ntime: (i) the evolution of morphology during the compounding process; (ii) the dimensional stability and \n\nthermal properties of the composites; (iii) the effect of suberin, lignin, and initiator agent on the tensile \n\nproperties. These properties are compared with those of an equivalent system using a coupling agent \n\nbased on maleic anhydride (PE-g-MA). \n\n6.2 Experimental section \n\n6.2.1 Materials \n\nCork powder, with an average particle size &lt;500 \u00b5m, a specific weight of 157 \u00b1 2 kg m-3 and a \n\nhumidity of ~5.4% was supplied by Amorim Revestimentos S.A. (Oleiros, Portugal).  \n\nThe matrix was a high density polyethylene HDPE, (HMA \u2013 025 from ExxonMobil, Germany), with a MFI \n\nof 8.2 g.10min-1 (190 \u00baC, 2.16 kg), and a melting point of 136.6 \u00baC, containing a thermal stabilizer.  \n\nHDPE grafted with maleic anhydride (PE-g-MA), containing 0.5 to 1.0 wt% of maleic anhydride (Exxelor \n\nPE 1040), with MFI of 1.4 g.10 min-1 (190 \u00baC, 2.16 kg), and having a melting point of 131.3 \u00baC, was \n\nproduced by ExxonMobil, Germany.  \n\nBenzoyl peroxide (BPO, 75%), USP grade, Luperox\u00ae, was obtained from Atofina Chemicals.  \n\nThe compositions prepared are presented in Table 6.1. The cork-polymer (20-80) wt.% ratio was \n\nmaintained in all formulations.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Functionalized cork-polymer composites (CPC) by reactive extrusion using suberin and \n\nlignin from cork as coupling agents \n\n \n\n209 \n\nTable 6.1.

The resulting material was used to obtain the suberin and lignin \n\nfractions. Suberin extraction procedure was adapted from Ekman R et al. [25] and Pinto PCRO et al. \n\n[26]. The product (1g to 13ml) was refluxed in Ethanol:Water (25:1) containing 0.5M sodium hydroxide \n\nfor a period of 6 h. After cooling, the resulting mixture was filtered and the liquid fraction was acidified \n\nto pH 5-6 with hydrochloric acid. After filtration, the solvent was removed in a vacuum evaporator. The \n\nresulting solid residue was suspended in water and extracted with 3 times the volume in chloroform. \n\nThe organic fraction was recovered and the solvent removed in a vacuum evaporator, resulting in a \n\nbrownish paste-like material. \n\nThe methodology for lignin extraction was adapted from Ekman et al. [25] and Browning BL [27]. The \n\nsolid residue resulting from the suberin extraction was thoroughly washed with distilled water until \n\nneutral pH. 350 ml of a 72% sulfuric acid solution were added to 30 g of this residue and the mixture \n\nwas maintained under agitation for 2 hours at room temperature, followed by the addition of 550 ml of \n\ndistilled water and refluxing for 4 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the solid residue was \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Functionalized cork-polymer composites (CPC) by reactive extrusion using suberin and \n\nlignin from cork as coupling agents \n\n \n\n210 \n\nrecovered through filtration and washed with distilled water until neutral pH, a dark powdery material \n\nbeing obtained. \n\n6.2.3 Twin-screw compounding \n\nBefore compounding, the cork powder was pre-dried at 80 \u00baC in a vacuum oven until constant weight. \n\nThe raw materials, including the pulverized polyethylene, the benzoyl peroxide (BPO) and PE-g-MA, were \n\npre-mixed. Compounding was performed in a prototype modular laboratorial mini intermeshing co-\n\nrotating twin-screw extruder (TSE), with a screw diameter of 13 mm, and a length to diameter ratio \n\n(L/D) = 27, coupled to a rod die with a diameter of 3mm. The screw profile is built by sliding along a \n\nshaft conveying and kneading elements with a maximum channel depth of 1.5 mm. As seen in Figure \n\n6.1, the configuration used in the experiments induces polymer melting in the first restrictive block \n\nupstream and dispersive and distributive mixing in the second kneading block, which comprises 8 discs \n\nstaggered at -30\u00ba. The extruder is provided with sampling devices along its length which are capable to \n\ncollect in circa 1 second small amounts of material from within the screw channel [28]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.1. Twin-screw extruder set up. Screw profile is defined in terms of (pitch_length) of the various \n\nelements. A and B denote locations of material sampling. \n\n \n\nThis allowed to obtain cork-polymer samples at locations A and B identified in Figure 6.1, i.e., where \n\nmost of the dispersive mixing action should take place. The temperature profile along the barrel and die \n\nwas set to 165/180/185/185/175 \u00b0C for all the experiments, the feed rate was kept at 130 g/h, and \n\nthe screws rotating at 70 rpm. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Functionalized cork-polymer composites (CPC) by reactive extrusion using suberin and \n\nlignin from cork as coupling agents \n\n \n\n211 \n\nFigure 6.2 shows the compounding methodology adopted. The pre-mixed polymer and cork were feed \n\nupstream (position 1) by a miniaturized volumetric feeder (based on a Moretto DVM 18 L), together with \n\nthe BPO initiator, or the PE-g-MA. Suberin and/or lignin were added in position 2, by means of an \n\nautomatic syringe pump (AL-1000, from WPI, USA), or manually, respectively. After air-cooling, part of \n\nthe extruded composite was pelletized. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.2.

The spectra were \n\nacquired between 4000 cm-1 and 500 cm-1 in a Shimadzu IR-Prestige 21 spectrometer, as the average of \n\n32 scans with a resolution of 4 cm-1. Suberin and Lignin spectra were obtained using the KBr pellet \n\ntechnique and cork spectra were recorded using the attenuated total reflectance (ATR) module (PIKE \n\nTechnologies).  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Functionalized cork-polymer composites (CPC) by reactive extrusion using suberin and \n\nlignin from cork as coupling agents \n\n \n\n212 \n\n6.2.5 Thermal properties \n\nThe thermal stability of cork and of its major isolated chemical fractions was determined using a TGA \n\nQ500 Thermogravimetric Analyser (TA Instruments, USA). Experiments were performed at a heating \n\nrate of 10 \u00b0C.min-1 from 50 \u00b0C to 600 \u00b0C under air atmosphere. All tests were repeated once. \n\nDifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and oxidation induction time (OIT) measurements were \n\nperformed in a TA instrument DSC Q100 model (USA) instrument on samples of 8\u201312 mg, at a heating \n\nrate of 10 \u00baCmin?1, under nitrogen atmosphere  (flux of ca. 50 ml min?1). Only the second run was \n\nanalysed for melting temperature (Tm) and melting enthalpy (?Hm). The degree of crystallinity was \n\ncalculated on the basis of a 100% crystalline PE a melting enthalpy of ?Hm\u00ba = 293 J/g [29]. The \n\nanalyses were performed in two samples of each condition. \n\nOIT measurements were conducted in the same equipment, with samples heated at a rate of 30 \n\n\u00baC.min-1 up to 200 \u00baC under nitrogen atmosphere. After 2 min at 200 \u00baC the atmosphere was changed \n\nto oxygen (both gases at flux 50 ml.min-1) and oxidation induction time was measured during the \n\nisothermal period.  The analyses were performed in three samples of each condition. \n\n6.2.6 Scanning electron microscopy \n\nFractured samples of the various composites were examined in a NanoSEM 200 FEI (The Netherlands) \n\nscanning electron microscope (SEM). Prior to the analysis, samples were coated with an Au/Pd alloy \n\n(80-20 wt. %) by ion sputtering in a high resolution sputter coater (Cressington 208HR, Watford, UK). \n\n6.2.7 Mechanical properties  \n\nThree millimetre thick plaques were obtained by compression moulding in a hot press (Moore, UK) of \n\nthe pellets of the various compositions at 150 \u00baC under an applied pressure of 1.42 MPa. The pellets \n\nwere kept during a period of 8 minutes without pressure and 2 minutes with pressure, followed by a \n\ncooling period under pressure. Tensile bars according to ISO 527\u20132 (with a cross-section of 3 \u00d7 4 mm2 \n\nat the neck) were machined by a Roland 3D Plotter (MDX-20, UK).  \n\nThe tensile properties were determined using a Universal tensile machine (Instron 4505 Universal \n\nMachine, USA) with a load cell of 1kN and a gauge length of 25 mm and a crosshead speed of 5mm \n\nmin?1. Samples were conditioned at room temperature for at least 48 h before testing and it was used 9 \n\nspecimens per condition. The tensile force was taken as the maximum force in the force deformation \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Functionalized cork-polymer composites (CPC) by reactive extrusion using suberin and \n\nlignin from cork as coupling agents \n\n \n\n213 \n\ncurve. Tensile modulus was estimated from the initial slope of the stress\u2013strain curve (between 0.05 \n\nand 1% strain) using linear regression. The normality of the distribution of the mechanical results was \n\nevaluated using the Shapiro-WilK test confirming their normal distribution at p<0.05. The results were \n\ncompared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the post hoc Bonferroni multiple \n\ncomparison tests to infer about the significant differences between mean values of the developed \n\nfunctionalized composites and the differences were considered significantly different at p<0.05 (*).  \n\n6.2.8 Dimensional stability \n\nMeasurements of water absorption and thickness swelling were made according to ASTM D 570 on the \n\nspecimens used for tensile testing, after vacuum-drying at 70 \u00baC and stabilization in a desiccator. Each \n\nspecimen was immersed in distilled water, at ambient temperature, in falcon tubes of 14 ml for \n\ndifferent time periods (up to 15 days). At the end of each period, five specimens of each condition were \n\ngently blotted with absorbent paper to remove the excess water on the surface, immediately reweighed \n\nand their thickness measured using a digital micrometer from Mitutoyo (Japan) (\u00b1 0.001 mm), and \n\nthen re-immersed. Water absorption (WA) was calculated as: \n\n \n\n100(%) ?\n?\n\n?\nb\n\nba\n\nW\n\nWW\nWA\n\n   (6.1) \n\n \n\nwhere Wa and Wb are the weights (g) after and before immersion, respectively. The thickness swelling \n\n(TS) is given by: \n\n \n\n100(%)\n1\n\n12 ?\n?\n\n?\nT\n\nTT\nTS\n\n   (6.2) \n\n \n\nwhere T2 is the thickness of the wetted specimen  and T1 is the initial thickness. Five specimens per \n\ncondition were measured. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Functionalized cork-polymer composites (CPC) by reactive extrusion using suberin and \n\nlignin from cork as coupling agents \n\n \n\n214 \n\n6.3 Results and Discussion \n\n6.3.1 Chemical characterization \n\nThe FTIR spectrum of cork presented in Figure 6.3 is dominated by the presence of absorption bands \n\nfor hydroxyl (3400 cm-1), methylene (2920, 2850 and 1452 cm-1) and ester (1736, 1240 and 1150 cm-\n\n1) groups. The absorption band at 1508 cm-1 is associated with the vibration of the aromatic skeleton. \n\nThis is consistent with the existence of highly suberized cell walls characteristic of cork.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.3. ATR-FTIR spectra of cork and its major chemical isolated components used as coupling \n\nagent. \n\n \n\nThe spectrum of suberin is similar to that of cork, retaining essentially the absorption bands related to \n\nthe aliphatic ester moieties. Therefore, the suberin obtained by extraction probably has its constitutive \n\naliphatic monomers transesterified or in oligomeric blocks arising from incomplete depolymerization. \n\nThe lignin spectrum presents an intense band at 3400cm-1 due to hydroxyl groups, together with a \n\nshoulder at around 2570 cm-1. This configuration, in combination with the absorption band at 1714 cm-1, \n\nis consistent with the presence of carboxylic acid groups; the relatively intense 1610 and 1505 cm-1 \n\nbands are related to the presence of aromatic structures.  \n\nIn summary, lignin and suberin partially retain the original cork structures. The aliphatic esterified \n\ndomain is represented in suberin, whereas the aromatic domain in present in lignin. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Functionalized cork-polymer composites (CPC) by reactive extrusion using suberin and \n\nlignin from cork as coupling agents \n\n \n\n215 \n\n6.3.2 Thermal properties \n\n6.3.2.1 Cork, suberin and lignin \n\nThe thermogravimetric curves of cork and of its chemical fractions under air atmosphere are \n\nrepresented in Figure 6.4 in terms of weight loss and its derivative. A multi-step degradation process is \n\nevident. Cork and lignin show some weight reduction between room temperature and 150 \u00b0C, due to \n\nthe loss of water molecules (suberin is hydrophobic).  \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 6.4. Thermogravimetric curves of cork and the principal chemical components under air \n\natmosphere (a) and respective derivative curves (b). \n\n \n\nThe thermal degradation of cork starts at approximately at 270 \u00baC, with the first intensive weight loss at \n\n~ 348 \u00baC and a second important region at circa 460 \u00baC (Figure 6.4 b). This pattern should correspond \n\nto the degradation of the major cork components. The derivative curves of the isolated cork fractions \n\ndemonstrate that the thermal decomposition of suberin and lignin occur independently. Suberin \n\ndisplays good thermal stability up to around 259 \u00b0C, followed by a progressive weight loss, reaching \n\nnearly 45% at 338 \u00b0C and 87% at 494 \u00baC. Lignin shows a small shoulder at 193 \u00baC, a low temperature \n\nwhen compared with cork and suberin, probably due to the monomeric structures of lignin resulting \n\nfrom extraction. Its maximum decomposition takes place at about 515 \u00baC, confirming the higher \n\nthermal resistance as compared with suberin. At higher temperatures, the isolated cork fractions seem \n\nto present higher thermal stability. However, at 600 \u00baC no char weight residue was detected.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Functionalized cork-polymer composites (CPC) by reactive extrusion using suberin and \n\nlignin from cork as coupling agents \n\n \n\n216 \n\n6.3.2.2 Composites \n\nThe main features from the thermogravimetric analysis of the composites under air atmosphere are \n\nidentified in Table 6.2. In all cases, the onset of degradation was higher than 265 \u00baC and the ash \n\ncontent was less than 0.3% at 600 \u00baC. Although the HDPE matrix contains a thermal stabilizer, the \n\naddition of PE-g-MA and of 4 wt.% of lignin seems to have acted as a thermal protective barrier to cork, \n\nenhancing the thermal stability up to temperatures as high as 387 - 395 \u00baC. This characteristic agrees \n\nwell with the curves of Figure 6.4, where lignin showed higher thermal resistance. Thus, lignin could be \n\neventually used as a flame retardant. \n\n \n\nTable 6.2.

The results \n\nshow a slight increment of Tc and degree of crystallinity for composites CPC 1 and CPC 2, indicating \n\nthat the presence of cork promotes crystallization. This nucleating ability of cork has been previously \n\nobserved [5]. No significant changes in the Tm of the composites were detected. The composites \n\ncontaining suberin and lignin revealed lower melting enthalpy and crystallinity, probably due to BPO \n\nmodification, which induces the formation of macro-radicals that may produce branching and chain \n\nextensions [30]. \n\nOxidative induction time (OIT) measurements were performed at 200\u00b0C to compare the oxidation of the \n\ncomposites and analyse the effect of the proposed eco-friendly coupling agents. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Functionalized cork-polymer composites (CPC) by reactive extrusion using suberin and \n\nlignin from cork as coupling agents \n\n \n\n217 \n\nTable 6.3, shows high values of OIT for all tested composites due to the use of HDPE grade with \n\nthermal stabilizer. Significant differences in the onset decomposition time of the exothermic reactions \n\nwere found, with the OIT varying from 54.2 to 74.6 min. It was found that the use of 2 wt.% of lignin \n\nCPC 4, does not influence significantly the thermal-oxidative stability of the composites under the \n\nisothermal conditions. However, the increase to 4 wt.% of lignin CPC 5, results in a reduction of the OIT. \n\nIn despite of the reduction of the polymer %, the overall decrease of OIT is moderated by the presence \n\nof lignin. \n\n \n\nTable 6.3.

It is speculated that the existing aromatic \n\ndomains of suberin contain various substituted phenolic groups [32], that may function as antioxidant. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Functionalized cork-polymer composites (CPC) by reactive extrusion using suberin and \n\nlignin from cork as coupling agents \n\n \n\n218 \n\n6.3.3 Morphology \n\n6.3.3.1 Morphology evolution during compounding \n\nThe morphology evolution during the twin-screw extrusion (TSE) process of the principal compositions \n\nafter cryogenic fracture is presented in Figure 6.5.

It can be observed the high distributive mixing capacity during the melting of \n\nthe co-rotating TSE: the cork particles are well distributed and dispersed in the polymer matrix upstream \n\nthe die zone, in particular for the CPC 2 to CPC 7 compositions. This result demonstrates: (a) the \n\nimportance of intensive mixing zones in the screw configuration to promote the efficient mixing of the \n\nmonomer with the polymer, in this case a block of 4 kneading disks with a staggering angle -30\u00ba and \n\n(b) highlights the importance of the coupling agent based on PE-g-MA, suberin or lignin to promote \n\ndispersion of the natural phase. \n\n \n\n Location Zone A Location Zone B Die Zone CPC Pellet \n\nC\nP\n\nC\n 1\n\n \n\n1 mm\n\n \n1 mm\n\n \n50 \u00b5m\n\n \n\nC\nP\n\nC\n  \n2\n \n\n1 mm\n\n \n1 mm\n\n \n50 \u00b5m\n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Functionalized cork-polymer composites (CPC) by reactive extrusion using suberin and \n\nlignin from cork as coupling agents \n\n \n\n219 \n\nC\nP\n\nC\n 3\n\n \n\n1 mm\n\n \n1 mm\n\n \n50 \u00b5m\n\n \n\nC\nP\n\nC\n 4\n\n \n\n1 mm\n\n \n1 mm\n\n \n50 \u00b5m\n\n \n\nC\nP\n\nC\n 7\n\n \n\n1 mm\n\n \n1 mm\n\n \n50 \u00b5m\n\n \n\nFigure 6.5.

The \n\ncomposite pellets containing lignin, presented in Figure 6.2 b), have a more intense brown colour with \n\nwell dispersed lignin.  \n\nThe fracture morphology of the composites after tensile tests is presented in Figure 6.6. The tensile \n\nfracture of the unreinforced CPC is presented in Figure 6.6 b) and reveals high stretched elements of \n\nHDPE between the cork particles. Figure 6.6 c and d) shows the influence of the addition of PE-g-MA \n\nwith the fracture occurring at the same level of the cork and the polymeric matrix, supporting the \n\nindication of good adhesion.  \n\nBoth results are in agreement with previous works using melt based technologies such as pultrusion \n\nand extrusion to produce cork based composites [6, 19]. The morphology of CPC 4 using 2wt.% of \n\nlignin presents similar fracture as compared with the composite using PE-g-MA. The composites with \n\n2wt.% of suberin in Figure 6.6 f ) two distinct zones of the polymeric phase can be observed: (i) a small \n\nportion of the polymeric matrix is stretched, probably due to the presence of suberin which is promoting \n\nadditional ductility, also observed at lower magnification in Figure 6.6 e) and (ii) a fracture zone that \n\noccurs at the same level than cork phase due to the presence of the BPO. Moreover, during the \n\nextrusion process the visual aspect of the extruded composite surface containing suberin was smoother, \n\nreducing the shear during the extrusion. This effect may be related with a plasticizer capacity of suberin \n\ncomposed of esterified monomers and oligomers [9]. Additionally, we did not observe the presence of \n\nmicro-voids on the different composites fracture, probably due to the temperature and pressure applied \n\nduring the compression moulding to produce the composite boards. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Functionalized cork-polymer composites (CPC) by reactive extrusion using suberin and \n\nlignin from cork as coupling agents \n\n \n\n221 \n\nC\nP\n\nC\n 1\n\n \n\n200 \u00b5m\n\na)\n\n \n50 \u00b5m\n\nb)\n\n \n\nC\nP\n\nC\n  \n2\n (\n\nP\nE\n-g\n\n-M\nA\n 2\n\n w\nt.\n%\n\n) \n\n200 \u00b5m\n\nc)\n\n \n50 \u00b5m\n\nd)\n\n \n\nC\nP\n\nC\n 3\n\n (\nS\nu\nb\ner\n\nin\n 2\n\n w\nt.\n%\n\n) \n\n200 \u00b5m\n\ne)\n\n \n50 \u00b5m\n\nf )\n\n \n\nC\nP\n\nC\n 4\n\n (\nLi\n\ngn\nin\n\n 2\n w\n\nt.\n%\n\n) \n\n200 \u00b5m\n\ng)\n\n \n50 \u00b5m\n\nh)\n\n \n\nFigure 6.6.

Variation of the tensile properties comparing with the control non-reinforced cork-polymer \n\n(20-80) wt.% composition (CPC 1). \n\n \n\nIt can be clearly observed that the use of a coupling agent based on maleic anhydride (MA) \n\nconsiderably increases both strength and modulus of the materials and reduces the maximum strain. \n\nThe MA may interact with the polar groups of cork (mainly hydroxyl groups (-OH)) of lignin and \n\nhemicellulose to form covalent or hydrogen bonding, providing chemical affinity and strong adhesion at \n\nthe interface. The use of the BPO is represented in CPC 7, showed to act as a coupling agent without a \n\nnegative effect on the maximum strain. During the extrusion process, BPO may initiate radicals which \n\nreact with the cork surface and the polymeric matrix, promoting chemical bonding between the two \n\nphases. In the literature [33], it is referred that the grafting of peroxide radicals onto polyethylene could \n\ntake place though an attack on the tertiary carbons and on the few double bonds present in the \n\nbackbone chain. Alternatively, the combination of  peroxide groups and high temperatures could \n\nintroduce polarity in the  polymer, thereby  increasing the adhesion  at polymer-fibre contacts [33]. Due \n\nto the chemical nature of cork, it is speculated that a similar action process can occur during the \n\nprocessing of the developed composites, resulting in an enhancement on the mechanical performance. \n\nIn the functionalized CPC, the addition of 2 wt% of suberin promoted an increase of the maximum \n\ntensile strength, modulus and maximum strain comparing with the unreinforced CPC 1.  However and \n\ncomparing with the CPC 7, the real effect of improvement was observed for the maximum strain with \n\nan increasing of 6.7%. It seems that suberin can act as plasticizer agent during the extrusion process, \n\nreducing the stiffness and contributing with some additional flexibility to the composite material. This \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Functionalized cork-polymer composites (CPC) by reactive extrusion using suberin and \n\nlignin from cork as coupling agents \n\n \n\n224 \n\neffect of suberin on the composites resembles in part its function on the cork material, being \n\nresponsible for the elasticity on the cork material [7]. Moreover, glycerol is the principal monomer of \n\nsuberin [13], which is used as plasticizer on composite systems [34, 35]. The challenge on the \n\nproduction of CPC with a high cork content using extrusion is the poor processability of the components, \n\nwhich may result in inadequate properties of the resulting composite. The use of suberin acting as bio-\n\nbased plasticizer can reduce the high friction created by the cork, reducing the shear during the \n\nextrusion process.  \n\nSurprisingly, the introduction of 2 wt% of lignin in the presence of BPO (CPC 4) increased the maximum \n\ntensile strength in 48% and the tensile modulus in 39% and decreased the maximum strain. The result \n\nconfirms the high effectiveness of lignin as coupling agent, improving the interfacial adhesion and \n\nproviding stress transfer from the matrix to the natural filler. The function of lignin as coupling agent is \n\nenabled by the presence of both aliphatic and polar hydroxyl groups, which provide compatibility \n\nbetween nonpolar polymers and lignocellulosic materials [22, 23, 36], such as cork. The increase of \n\nthe lignin content (CPC 5) does not contribute to an additional increase on the mechanical performance. \n\nOn the contrary, it results on a reduction of the maximum tensile strength.  On the other hand, we also \n\nfound that the feeding of lignin in the hopper system of the extruder (CPC 6) is not so effective to \n\npromote strength but increases the maximum tensile strain. Probably, the higher residence time of the \n\nlignin in the extruder promoted a better dispersion of lignin and consequently of cork phase in the \n\npolyethylene matrix increasing the maximum strain in 5.7%. \n\n6.3.5 Dimensional Stability  \n\nAfter processing, the moisture content of the developed composite specimens was determined, being \n\nthe highest for CPC 1, with 0.313 \u00b1 0.004 %, and the lowest for CPC 3, with 0.276 \u00b1 0.011 %, \n\ncorresponding to the functionalized composite with suberin. The functionalized CPC with the addition of \n\nlignin (CPC 4) presented 0.291 \u00b1 0.009% of moisture content. \n\nThe water uptake behaviour of the different CPC was examined as a function of the time see in Figure \n\n6.9. In the absence of coupling agent a faster water uptake was observed when compared with the \n\nfunctionalized composites due to the hydroxyl groups from cork which are available for interaction with \n\nwater molecules.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Functionalized cork-polymer composites (CPC) by reactive extrusion using suberin and \n\nlignin from cork as coupling agents \n\n \n\n225 \n\n \n\nFigure 6.9. Water absorption behaviour of the HDPE-cork composites with and without coupling agent, \n\nbeing PE-g-MA the coupling agent based on maleic anhydride. \n\n \n\nEven for the maximum period of immersion studied (360 h), the water uptake for the composites was \n\ninferior to 1.7%, which is a clear advantageous property for many applications. The use of coupling \n\nagent significantly reduces the water absorption of the developed composites. The specimens with \n\nsuberin and lignin absorb less water comparing with the unreinforced cork-polymer composition. In the \n\nfirsts 24h of immersion in water the CPC 1 absorbed 0.59 \u00b1 0.06 wt.% of water while the CPC 3 \n\ncontaining 2 wt% of suberin only absorbs 0.40 \u00b1 0.02 wt.%. This difference is more evident after the 7 \n\ndays of immersion were the CPC 3 absorbs less 32.5% of water comparing with the condition of the \n\nCPC 1 and less 66.3% comparing with the composite containing 2wt% of lignin (CPC 4). This result \n\nsupports the idea that suberin and lignin can act as coupling agent, reducing the moisture content and \n\nthe water absorption of the CPC in a similar way to what was observed for the composite containing PE-\n\ng-MA. Moreover, suberin has a hydrophobic character that contributes to the low permeability of cork \n\n[4]. The addition of 1 wt.% of benzoyl peroxide could also be responsible to react with some hydroxyl \n\ngroups from the cork structure, further contributing to reducing the water absorption.  \n\nThe thickness swelling variation for all the composites was less than 0.4% as presented in Figure 6.10. \n\nIt was observed that the coupling agent effect promotes less thickness variation. Increasing the lignin \n\ncontent (CPC 5), leads to a lower thickness variation. For the functionalized CPC and after the period of \n\n15 days the thickness swelling variation tends to stabilize. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Functionalized cork-polymer composites (CPC) by reactive extrusion using suberin and \n\nlignin from cork as coupling agents \n\n \n\n226 \n\n \n\nFigure 6.10. Thickness swelling variation of the functionalized CPC comparing with the control condition \n\n(CPC 1) with HDPE-cork (80-20) wt.%, being PE-g-MA the coupling agent based on maleic anhydride. \n\n \n\n6.4 Conclusions \n\nThe following conclusions can be drawn base on the results presented in this work. Suberin and lignin \n\nfractions, isolated from cork, presents sufficient thermal stability to be applied in melt based \n\ntechnologies such as extrusion and compression moulding. A reactive twin-screw extrusion process was \n\nused to obtain the cork-polymer composites (CPC) in a continuous process. The mechanical tensile \n\ntests indicated that the suberin and lignin can be successfully used as bio-based coupling agents in the \n\npresence of benzoyl peroxide (BPO) to produce functionalized CPC with superior mechanical properties. \n\nPreferably, suberin acts as a plasticizer, improving the cork dispersion and reduces the composite \n\nstiffness, providing additional flexibility and formability to the composite. Lignin shows to act as a \n\ncoupling agent and the use of 2wt% of lignin improved both maximum tensile strength and modulus in \n\n48% and 39% respectively. Increasing the amount of lignin to 4 wt.% reduces the mechanical \n\nperformance of the composites. The extrusion process shows that the addition of lignin in the feed \n\nhopper of the extruder is not advantageous and only increases the maximum tensile strain. The tensile \n\ntests also reveal that the use of 2 wt% of PE-g-MA increases 34% the maximum strength, 30% the tensile \n\nmodulus and reduces the maximum strain. Coupling agents in CPCs play a very important role in \n\nimproving compatibility and adhesion between the polar cork material and the non-polar polymer \n\nmatrices. The CPCs present low water uptake and thickness swelling variation. The use of coupling \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Functionalized cork-polymer composites (CPC) by reactive extrusion using suberin and \n\nlignin from cork as coupling agents \n\n \n\n227 \n\nagent based on maleic anhydride or by adding suberin or lignin further reduces considerably the water \n\nuptake of the composites. The thermal properties showed that lignin can act as a thermal protective \n\nagent and suberin act as an antioxidant agent on the composites, while the PE-g-MA act as both. \n\nCoupling agents obtained from renewable resources may constitute a viable alternative to existing \n\npetroleum derivatives, contributing for a sustainable development of structural materials. \n\n6.5 References \n\n[1] Faruk O, Bledzki AK, Fink H-P, Sain M.

Over the past two decades, natural fibres have received considerable attention as a substitute for \n\nsynthetic fibre reinforcements in polymeric materials. Natural fibres are increasingly used for \n\nreinforcement in thermoplastics over traditional reinforcing materials such as glass fibres and particle \n\nminerals (e.g. talc, CaCO3 and mica) due to their low cost, lightweight, good thermal and acoustic \n\ninsulation, acceptable specific strength, reduced tool wear, corrosion resistance, availability, renewable \n\nresource and recycling possible with lower environment impact [2, 3], promoting the concept of \n\nsustainability. As a result of these advantages some of the plant fibre based thermoplastic composites \n\nhave already found applications in furniture manufacture, non-structural building applications and as \n\ninteriors parts in automotive industry [4-6]. Cork is the suberous covering tissue of the species Quercus \n\nSuber L., commonly known as the cork oak and the unique properties arise from the closed cell \n\nstructure [7, 8]. During the last years there has been an increasing interest concerning cork based \n\nmaterials and its potential to be used in composite applications [5, 9, 10]. However, natural materials \n\nare inherently incompatible with hydrophobic thermoplastics such as polyolefins reducing the \n\nmechanical performance. Major limitations of using natural materials as reinforcements in such \n\nmatrices include poor interfacial adhesion between polar-hydrophilic fibre and nonpolar-hydrophobic \n\nmatrix, and difficulties in mixing due to poor wetting of the fibre with the thermoplastic matrix [11]. \n\nPrevious studies on cork-polymer composites (CPC) have demonstrate that increasing the cork content \n\nthe tensile mechanical properties are compromised and reduced [12, 13]. Reinforcement strategies of \n\ncork composites, such as the use of low amounts of coupling agent (CA) [14], or the use of \n\nconventional chemical modification methods of the natural component [15], can be applied to improve \n\nthe compatibility and interfacial bonding between polymeric matrix and dispersed component. The \n\nmotivation of this work was to prepare high performance cork based composites, in order to support \n\ntensile stresses developed in complex geometries or when submitted to finishing operations such as \n\nlamination, by using natural fibres preferably in combination with a CA. Additionally, studies involving \n\nhybrid bio-fibre systems containing cork powder through melt based technologies have not been \n\naddressed so far. Therefore composites comprising these two kinds of natural materials (e.g. cork and \n\ncoconut fibre) may exhibit the desirable properties of the individual constituents. Coconut fibre, or coir, \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \u2013 Novel cork-polymer composites reinforced with short natural coconut fibres: Effect of fibre \n\nloading and coupling agent addition \n\n \n\n234 \n\nis a versatile lignocellulosic fibre obtained from coconut trees (Cocos nucifera), which grow extensively \n\nin tropical countries. Sri Lanka and India are considered to be the major coir fibre producers in the \n\nworld. Coconut fibres may be decomposed in 20\u201330 years in the nature, and it may be regarded as an \n\nenvironmentally friendly material [16]. Chemical composition [7, 17-20] of both natural materials is \n\npresented in Table 7.1.  \n\n \n\nTable 7.1.

Both coconut fibres and cork \n\nare used as insulator material in thermal and acoustic applications [24, 25] and presents lower \n\nhydrophilic behaviour when compared with sisal fibre [26]. In this study, high density polyethylene \n\n(HDPE) was selected as the matrix to develop the hybrid cork-based composites because:  HDPE \n\npresents a good balance property range, is easy to process through melt based technologies, such as \n\nextrusion and compression moulding, and is a high consumption industrial polymer that presents low \n\nprice in the market which is of significant importance to the \u2018cost-performance\u2019 assessment. \n\nAdditionally, it requires a relatively low processing temperature, which is essential because of the \n\nrelatively low thermal stability of both natural components. In this work, we report the effect of using \n\ncoconut fibre as a reinforcement material, preferably in the presence of 2 wt.% of CA, to promote higher \n\nmechanical performance of the cork-based composites. \n\n7.2 Materials and Methods \n\n7.2.1 Natural Materials \n\nCork sanding powder, with particle size &lt;500 \u00b5m and specific weight of 157 \u00b1 2 kg m-3 and a humidity \n\nof ~5.4% was collected at the Amorim Revestimentos S.A. (S. Paio  Oleiros, Portugal) industrial facilities. \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \u2013 Novel cork-polymer composites reinforced with short natural coconut fibres: Effect of fibre \n\nloading and coupling agent addition \n\n \n\n235 \n\nThe brown coconut fibre from Hayleys Exports PLC (Kotugoda, Sr\u00ed Lanka) presented a diameter of \n\n277.4 \u00b1 38.8 \u00b5m, a humidity of 8.2 % and specific weight of 845.1 \u00b1 46.6 Kg m-3, was collected at \n\nAmorim Isolamentos S.A. (Vendas Novas, Portugal). \n\n7.2.2 Polymer materials and coupling agent \n\nA commercially available polyethylene (HMA \u2013 025), HDPE, with a MFI of 8.2 g.10min-1 (190 \u00baC, 2.16 \n\nkg), with a melting point of 132.5 \u00baC from ExxonMobil (Germany) was supplied by Pallmann \n\nMaschinenfabrik GmbH &amp; Co. (Germany) in the powder form with particle size between 125 ?m and \n\n1500 ?m. The used coupling agent, a HDPE functionalized with maleic anhydride (PE-g-MA), containing \n\n0.5 to1.0 wt% of maleic anhydride, was Exxelor PE 1040, with MFI of 1.4 g.10min-1 (190 \u00baC, 2.16 kg), \n\nand a melting point of 131.3 \u00baC, from ExxonMobil (Germany).  \n\n7.2.3 Fibre diameter and density \n\nThe diameter measurements of coconut fibres were made in five spaced locations along the gauge \n\nlength of 30 different specimens using an optical microscope Olympus BH-2 (Tokyo, Japan) equipped \n\nwith an Olympus DP11, (Japan) digital camera. A histogram for the coconut fibre was performed and a \n\nnormal distribution to characterize the coconut fibre diameter. Regarding cork powder, the particle size \n\nwas determined used an analytical sieve (Retsch. AS 200, Germany) after a sieving period of 5 min at a \n\nmedium amplitude. The density of the coconut fibres and of the hybrid cork based composites were \n\ndetermined according to the standard ASTM D 792, using an analytical balance equipped with a \n\nstationary support for the immersion vessel using liquid propanol. \n\n7.2.4 Chemical characterization \n\nTo confirm the existing differences in chemical composition, both natural materials were analysed using \n\nFourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. All the spectra were acquired using a Shimadzu IR-\n\nPrestige 21. The attenuated total reflectance (ATR) methodology (PIKE Technologies) was used and the \n\nspectra were acquired between 4400 cm-1 to 800 cm-1 using a resolution of 4 cm-1. \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \u2013 Novel cork-polymer composites reinforced with short natural coconut fibres: Effect of fibre \n\nloading and coupling agent addition \n\n \n\n236 \n\n7.2.5 Composites processing \n\nBefore compounding all natural raw materials were pre-dried at 80 \u00baC during 24 h to stabilise the cork \n\nand the coconut fibres in terms of moisture content. The moisture content, determined by oven-dry \n\nweight before processing, was found to be 1.5-3%.

The barrel temperature was in the range 130-160 \u00baC, and the screw speed was \n\nfixed at 30 rpm. The cork powder and the grinding HDPE were pre-mixed and manually feed in the \n\nhopper system with the cut coconut fibres. No extrusion head was used in order to minimize the \n\nresidence time and shear heat dissipation. The extruded material was cooled in air, granulated in a \n\ncutting mill to produce the composite pellets with dimensions ? 7 mm. In a further step, the obtained \n\npellets were compression moulded using a hydraulic press (Moore, UK) to produce boards with 186 \u00d7 \n\n118 mm2 and 3 mm of thickness from the different compositions. The mould temperature was 150 \u00baC \n\nand the material was 8 minutes without pressure followed by 2 minutes under pressure of 1.42 MPa. \n\nTensile bars in dog bone shape were obtained from these boards using a computer numerical control \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \u2013 Novel cork-polymer composites reinforced with short natural coconut fibres: Effect of fibre \n\nloading and coupling agent addition \n\n \n\n237 \n\nCNC machine (Roland 3D Plotter MDX-20, UK). After cut the hybrid composites are compact and do not \n\npresent macroscopic porous or voids. The specimens were produced according to ISO 527\u20132. \n\nNonetheless, its thickness is slightly higher (3 mm) than the standard. \n\n7.2.6 Scanning electron microscopy \n\nThe morphology of the natural fibres and the fracture surface of the tensile tested composite specimens \n\nwere analysed using a NanoSEM 200 FEI (The Netherlands) scanning electron microscope (SEM). \n\nBefore being analysed all the specimens were coated by ion sputtering with an Au/Pd alloy (80-20 wt.%) \n\nin a high resolution sputter coater of Cressington 208HR (Watford, UK). \n\n7.2.7 Mechanical properties \n\nTensile properties of the bundle coconut fibres were measured with a Instron 4505 Universal Machine, \n\n(USA) using a 1 kN load cell, a crosshead speed of 1 mm.min?1, and a fibre gauge length of 30 mm. \n\nPrior to testing, fibres were mounted on sturdy paper frames using a high-strength epoxy adhesive and \n\nplaced in a desiccator for a minimum of 48 h.  \n\nThe tensile properties of the developed cork based composites reinforced with coconut fibres were \n\ndetermined in the same equipment according the standard ISO 527\u20132, using a gauge length of 20 mm. \n\nThe tensile force was taken as the maximum force in the force deformation curve. Tensile modulus was \n\nestimated from the initial slope of the stress\u2013strain curve (between 0.05 and 1% strain) using the linear \n\nregression method. Samples were conditioned at room temperature for at least 48 h before testing. A \n\ncrosshead speed of 5 mm.min?1 was used until rupture. The average and standard deviations were \n\ndetermined using 8 specimens per condition. To allow for a comparison of the material property profiles \n\nin terms of the potential for reinforcement of the mechanical performance, the Ashby plots for the \n\nspecific tensile modulus against the specific strength are illustrated for absolute property values with the \n\nrespective standard deviations. \n\n7.2.8 Statistical analysis \n\nOne-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc Bonferroni multiple comparison tests was used to \n\ninfer about significant differences between mean values of the mechanical properties in the developed \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \u2013 Novel cork-polymer composites reinforced with short natural coconut fibres: Effect of fibre \n\nloading and coupling agent addition \n\n \n\n238 \n\ncork composite materials.

In both native materials, the IR spectrum \n\nshows a large band in the 3200\u20133600 cm-1 range that is attributed to the axial deformation of the O\u2013H \n\ngroup. The absorption spectrum on the infrared region of the coconut fibre presents a characteristic \n\nband at 2920 cm-1 that is related to the axial deformation of C\u2013H group. The carbonyl group of the \n\nhemicelluloses appears at 1620 cm-1, while the band at 1236 cm-1 is associated to the presence of C\u2013\n\n\n\nChapter 7 \u2013 Novel cork-polymer composites reinforced with short natural coconut fibres: Effect of fibre \n\nloading and coupling agent addition \n\n \n\n239 \n\nO\u2013C in cellulose chain.

The morphological analysis \n\nrevealed that cork powder presents several cells despite its reduced particle size (Figure 7.2 b). This \n\nanisotropic foamed material presents a close cellular structure [7] where the section of the cork particle \n\nshows preferentially the radial direction. The morphology of the coconut fibres was also analysed and \n\nthe results are shown in Figure 7.2 d). The obtained SEM image shows a representative top surface of \n\nthe coconut fibre displaying many pinholes on the surface (\u2018rotten wood\u2019-like appearance) [26].  The \n\ninset image presents the cross-section of the coconut fibre, which can be more or less cylindrical, \n\ncontaining axially oriented cells/fibrils of around 10 \u00b5m diameter. These observations are in accordance \n\nwith the results reported in literature [22, 26]. The mechanical tests of the coconut fibres revealed an \n\nhigher mechanical performance than the thermoplastic matrix (Table 7.3 and Figure 7.3). The coconut \n\nfibres have a maximum tensile strength of 134.3 \u00b1 34.5 MPa and tensile modulus of 2.16 \u00b1 0.62 GPa. \n\nIt was also observed that the tensile strength and elastic modulus of the fibres is inversely proportional \n\nto the fibre diameter: both properties decrease with increasing fibre diameter (Figure 7.3). According to \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \u2013 Novel cork-polymer composites reinforced with short natural coconut fibres: Effect of fibre \n\nloading and coupling agent addition \n\n \n\n241 \n\nthe linear regression analysis, this result was observed for 81% of the tested fibres. The strain at break \n\nfor coconut fibres was 34.4 \u00b1 4.7%. This higher failure strain capacity of the coconut fibres, as \n\ncompared with other natural fibres, can also contribute for a better strain compatibility between the \n\nfibres and the polyethylene matrix, making them and interesting material to be used in short-fibre filled \n\ncomposites. \n\n \n\ny = -0.3577x + 231.68\nR\u00b2 = 0.8122\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450\n\nT\ne\nn\n\ns\nil\n\ne\n S\n\ntr\ne\nn\n\ng\nth\n\n (\nM\n\nP\na\n)\n\nDiameter (\u00b5m)\n\na)\n\n \n\ny = -0.0064x + 3.9021\nR\u00b2 = 0.8091\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450\n\nE\n M\n\no\nd\n\nu\nlu\n\ns\n (\n\nG\nP\n\na\n)\n\nDiameter (\u00b5m)\n\nb)\n\n \n\nFigure 7.3.

This image reveals also a \n\nfragile fracture that is the result of the high volume content of cork powder. Moreover, the tensile \n\nfracture discloses that the cellular structure of cork powder is maintained but with a more compact \n\nmorphology after the two processing steps of extrusion and compression moulding, explaining the \n\ndensification that occurs on the lignocellulosic composites. The fracture surface of the composite \n\nprepared with the same cork/PE ratio and reinforced with 10 wt.% of short coconut fibre (CPC 5) was \n\nanalysed and the results are shown in Figure 7.4 c) and d). From these images is possible to conclude \n\nthat the interfacial adhesion between the fibres and the polymeric matrix is poor. The untreated fibres \n\nappear to be free of any matrix material adhering to them. It can be also observed the presence of \n\ncavities between the coconut fibre and the cork-polymer components. Additionally, significant coconut \n\nfibre breakage was observed during pelletization process after conventional melt mixing, reinforcing the \n\nidea of low adhesion between coconut fibres and the thermoplastic matrix. Nevertheless, the addition of \n\n2% of maleic anhydride produced an opposite effect. The micrographs from the fracture surface of CPC \n\n6 of (Figure 7.4 e and f) show a good interfacial adhesion between the coconut fibres (10 wt.%) and the \n\npolymeric matrix. In this last case, the fracture of the coconut fibre occurred preferentially at the same \n\nlevel of the composite fracture. Generally, chemical coupling agents are molecules pocessing two \n\nfunctions [6]: the first is to react with the hydroxyl groups of cork and of cellulosic fibres (OH groups) \n\nand the second is to react with functional groups of the matrix. The expected result is the reduction of \n\nthese groups that contribute to the hydrophilic character, promoting the compatibility between the \n\nmatrix and the natural component. \n\n7.3.4 Composite mechanical properties \n\n7.3.4.1 Tensile properties and density \n\nTensile tests were performed in order to evaluate the efficiency of the envisaged strategy aimed for \n\nimproving the mechanical performance of the cork-polymer composites (CPC).

The \n\npresence of 2 wt.% of coupling agent (CA), promotes a positive effect.  This is shown by a slight \n\ndecrease on the composite density, probably due to a better dispersion of the natural phase on the \n\nmatrix. \n\n \n\nTable 7.4.

Mechanical Properties of the developed composites. Symbol (*) denote composite materials \n\nwith statistical significant differences (p<0.05) and (ns) not significant, as using the one-way ANOVA \n\nmethod. \n\n \n\nComparing the CPC 1 and CPC 2 is possible to observe an increase of 12.5% in the maximum tensile \n\nstrength promoted by the CA. The results are in accordance with  the previous work using different \n\nqualities of cork powders with polyolefins processed by pultrusion [14]. When 5 to 10 wt.% of short \n\ncoconut fibres (CPC 3 and CPC 5) were used an increase of 18.1 to 21.6% on the tensile modulus was \n\nachieve being the hybrid composites more stiffer. However, no significant differences were observed on \n\nmaximum strength. Therefore, the use of fibres, without any additional physical or chemical treatment \n\nor additive, showed less efficiency than expected from their strength properties (see Table 7.3) due to \n\nthe poor adhesive interaction between the matrix and coconut fibres. This was reflected on the almost \n\ninsignificant increase on the tensile strength and reduction on ductility (Table 7.4). These results are in \n\naccordance with the morphological observations. On the other hand, the use of coconut fibres in \n\ncombination with 2 wt.% of CA resulted in an significant increase of the tensile properties, independently \n\nof the amount of fibres used. These effect was more pronounced when it was used the higher fraction \n\n10 wt.% of coconut fibre (CPC 6), resulting in an increase of 46% on maximum strength and 27% on \n\ntensile modulus and higher maximum strain at break when compared with the unreinforced cork-\n\npolymer composite (CPC 1). This considerable increment on the tensile properties is justified with the \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \u2013 Novel cork-polymer composites reinforced with short natural coconut fibres: Effect of fibre \n\nloading and coupling agent addition \n\n \n\n246 \n\nenhancement of the interfacial adhesion between the matrix and the fibres promoted by the CA based \n\non maleic anhydride that improves its ability to transfer stresses across the interface resulting on an \n\nincrease of the mechanical properties of the final composite. The Cv percentages reported in Table 7.4, \n\nshows the weight of the standard deviation over the distribution.  The maximum and minimum values \n\nregistered were 6.2% and 1.6% for tensile strength and, 9.8% and 3.3% for tensile modulus. The lowest \n\nCv values were obtained for the composite with higher mechanical performance (CPC 6). This is a clear \n\nindication that the produced boards had low variation on the mechanical properties, supporting the idea \n\nof homogeneous hybrid composites with good distribution of the natural component in the matrix. \n\n7.3.4.2 Ashby diagram \n\nThe mechanical properties of the different formulations were additionally organized in an Ashby diagram \n\nby plotting maximum tensile strength versus tensile modulus of the CPC with the respective both \n\nstandard deviations (Figure 7.6).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7.6. Ashby plot presenting the specific maximum tensile strength against specific tensile \n\nmodulus of the cork-polymer composites (CPC) obtained by extrusion followed by compression \n\nmoulding. \n\n \n\nThe results plotted in the graph can be divided in three distinct regions: a first region corresponding to \n\nthe mechanical properties of the cork based composites with and without the CA (CPC 2 and CPC 1 \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \u2013 Novel cork-polymer composites reinforced with short natural coconut fibres: Effect of fibre \n\nloading and coupling agent addition \n\n \n\n247 \n\nrespectively); a second region corresponding to the composites just reinforces with fibres (CPC 3 and \n\nCPC 5); and a third region corresponding to composites reinforced with fibres and treated with maleic \n\nanhydride - composites with higher tensile strength (CPC 4 and CPC 6). In Figure 7.6 the results were \n\nalso divided just in two regions: a bottom region corresponding to the composites prepared without CA \n\nand presenting lowest values of tensile strength but similar tensile modulus; and a top region \n\ncorresponding to the composites with highest values of tensile strength and tensile modulus. \n\nInterestingly, the diagram highlights the importance of the combine effect of CA based on maleic \n\nanhydride and the addition of coconut fibres as reinforcement strategy on cork-polymer composites. \n\n7.4 Conclusions \n\nThe mechanical reinforcement strategy of cork powder composites using random discontinuous \n\ndistributed coconut fibres through melt based technologies was investigated. The morphological \n\nobservations were in accordance with the mechanical results, showing the improved effect of fibre-\n\nmatrix adhesion in the presence of 2 wt.% of coupling agent (CA) based on maleic anhydride. The Ashby \n\ndiagram supported to identify the best developed composite formulation and to visualize the \n\nimprovement over the cork powder - polymer (50-50) wt.% composite. The incorporation of 10 wt.% of \n\ncoconut fibre in the presence of 2 wt.% of CA on the cork-based composites presented an increase of \n\n46% on the mechanical properties in terms of tensile maximum strength of and 27% in terms of tensile \n\nmodulus comparing with the unreinforced cork-polymer composite solution. Additionally, the presence \n\nof CA increases the maximum strain values in all processed composites.  \n\nThe maximum values registered in terms of coefficient of variation for this reinforced cork-based \n\ncomposite solution was 3.3% for the tensile modulus and 1.6% for the tensile strength properties. The \n\nlower coefficient variation supports the homogeneous properties in terms of short fibre distribution on \n\nthe novel hybrid cork-based composites. With this strategy it was possible to both improve the \n\nmechanical performances of cork-based composites and to increase the natural component up to 54 \n\nwt.% on the novel hybrid cork-based composite materials. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \u2013 Novel cork-polymer composites reinforced with short natural coconut fibres: Effect of fibre \n\nloading and coupling agent addition \n\n \n\n248 \n\n7.5 References \n\n[1] Mohanty AK, Misra M, Hinrichsen G.

Although, certain drawbacks, like incompatibility with the hydrophobic \n\npolymer matrix, the tendency to form aggregates during processing and the low resistance to moisture, \n\nreduce the potential  of using  natural fibres as reinforcement in polymers [2, 3, 5]. The incompatibility \n\nmay cause problems in the composite processing and in the material\u00b4s properties. The highly polar \n\ncharacter of natural fibres has inherently low compatibility with nonpolar polymer matrices, especially \n\nhydrocarbon matrices such as polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) [5]. As a result, the polymer \n\nmatrix is unable to transfer the stress to the filler through the interface when submitted to mechanical \n\nload, being the reinforcement efficiency reduced. Moreover moisture makes the use of natural fibre \n\nreinforced composites less attractive. Applying pre-treatments to the natural fibres can clean and \n\nchemically modify their surface, reduce the moisture absorption and increase surface roughness. These \n\nmethods are able to ameliorate the fibre-matrix adhesion with a positive effect on the mechanical \n\nproperties [4, 6-9]. A classic method of cellulose fibre modification is mercerization, which is an alkali \n\ntreatment where the natural and artificial impurities are removed, leading to fibrillation of the fibre \n\nbundle to smaller fibres [6, 10, 11], meaning lower fibre diameter and increasing the aspect ratio [10] . \n\nThe proper conditions of mercerization ensure the improvement of the tensile properties [3, 11, 12]. \n\nCork is the bark of the oak (Quercus suber L.) which is periodically harvested each 9 to 12 years [13]. \n\nThis lignocellulosic material holds environmental benefits to be applied on a new generation of \n\ncomposite materials [14-16]. Just a few studies were performed to improve the cork-matrix \n\nperformance of cork based composites using different strategies, including: (i) chemical modification of \n\ncork [15], (ii) the use of coupling agents [15, 17] to promote cork-matrix bonding and (iii) the use of \n\ndifferent natural or synthetic fibres to reinforce cork-polymer matrices [18-20]. The incorporation of \n\ndifferent types of fibres into a single matrix has led to the development of hybrid composites. Hybrid \n\ncomposite materials that contain two or more types of fibre combine the advantages of one type of \n\nfibres with the lacking of properties in the other. As a consequence, a balance in cost and performance \n\ncould be achieved through proper material design [21]. The properties of a hybrid composite depend on \n\nparameters such as fibre content, length and orientation of the fibres, fibre to matrix bonding and \n\narrangement of the different fibres. The strength of the hybrid composite is also dependent on the \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \u2013 Hybrid cork-polymer composites containing sisal fibre: Morphology, effect of the fibre \n\ntreatment on the mechanical properties and tensile failure prediction \n\n \n\n254 \n\nfailure strain of individual fibres. Maximum mechanical performance results are obtained when the \n\nfibres are highly strain compatible [22]. Sisal fibre is a cellulosic fibre obtained from leaves of an \n\nannually harvasted plant, called Agave sisalina and is one of the strongest of all plant fibres [8, 23].  \n\nThe aim of this work was to develop strategies to reinforce cork based composites with natural fibres, \n\nwith and without chemical treatment, in the presence of low amounts of the coupling agent to \n\nameliorate the mechanical properties. The production of hybrid composites was tested to obtain a \n\ncomposite with enhanced performance that could be used in complex geometries without failure, where \n\ncork cannot compete alone. Additionally one and two step extrusion processes were tested to evaluate \n\nthe correct form to obtain the hybrid cork-polymer pellets reinforced with sisal fibres, to be applied in \n\nthe compression moulding process in order to produce specimens of reinforced cork composites.  The \n\nproperties of the composites depend on the individual components and fibre-matrix interfacial \n\ncompatibility. The Weibull distribution provides a reliable possibility to predict the tensile strength of a \n\nneeded composite material, and this should be taken into account by the designer [24, 25]. Therefore, \n\nin this work we also consider the Weibull distribution to be a viable tool to predict the tensile strength \n\nfailure of the novel hybrid composites under analysis. \n\n \n\n8.2 Experimental section \n\n8.2.1 Materials \n\nCork powder, with an average particle size &lt;500 \u00b5m a specific weight of 157 \u00b1 2 kg m-3 and a humidity \n\nof ~5.4% was supplied by Amorim Revestimentos S.A.

The coupling agent, a HDPE \n\ngrafted with maleic anhydride (PE-g-MA), containing 0.5 to1.0 wt% of maleic anhydride (Exxelor PE \n\n1040) with MFI of 1.4 g.10min-1 (190 \u00baC, 2.16 kg), and a melting point of 131.3 \u00baC, produced by \n\nExxonMobil (Germany). The polymer and the coupling agent were supplied by Pallmann \n\nMaschinenfabrik GmbH &amp; Co. (Germany) after use a pulverizing system for plastics with particle size of \n\n250 ?m to 1.2mm.  \n\n8.2.2 Sisal fibre surface modification - Alkali treatment \n\nThe preparation of alkali treated sisal (Sisal_NaOH) was as follows [28]: the sisal fibres were immersed \n\nin sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution (5% w/v) for 2 h at room temperature. After that the fibres were \n\nwashed with distilled water containing a few drops of acetic acid. Final washings were carried out with \n\ndistilled water until neutrality (pH = 7), to remove the excess of NaOH present on the fibres, until this \n\nwater no longer indicated any alkalinity reaction. Then, the fibres were air-dried at room temperature, \n\nfollowed by drying in a vacuum oven at 70 \u00baC and after stabilise was stored in polyethylene bags.  \n\n8.2.3 Composite production \n\nBefore compounding all raw materials were pre-dried at 80\u00baC during 16h to stabilise the cork and the \n\nsisal fibres in terms of moisture content. After that the sisal fibres were cut in dimensions &lt;20 mm. \n\nThe prepared compositions and processing conditions are summarized in Table 8.2. The compounding \n\nwas performed in a counter-rotating twin-screw extrusion machine (Carvex, Portugal) which had a screw \n\ndiameter of 52 mm and an L/D ratio of 18. The barrel temperature was in the range 130-160 \u00baC, and \n\nthe screw speed was fixed at 30 rpm. The cork powder and the grinding HDPE were pre-mixed and \n\nmanually in small portions and feed in the hopper system with the sisal fibres.

All the spectra were acquired using a Shimadzu IR-Prestige 21. The attenuated total \n\nreflectance (ATR) methodology (PIKE Technologies) was used and the spectra were acquired between \n\n4400cm-1 to 800cm-1 using a resolution of 4cm-1. \n\n8.2.4.2 Crystallinity \n\nTo detect the crystalline structure of cellulose in sisal, Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXRD) \n\ndiffractograms were recorded using the Bruker-AXS D8 Discover diffractometer in ?\u20132? geometry using \n\nCu K?1,2 lines collimated with a Gob\u00ebl mirror, a divergent slit of 0.6 mm, a detector slit of 1 mm and \n\n0.6 mm and a Ni filter. The data was collected from 6-50\u00b0 with a step size of 0.04\u00b0 and an acquisition \n\ntime of 1\u00ba sec per step. The percentage of crystallinity (%Cr), performed using a fitting program, was \n\ncalculated based on:  \n\n \n\n%Cr = (Acryst / Atotal) \u00d7 100    (8.1) \n\n \n\nwhere  Acryst is the area below the diffraction peak of the  (002) plane, peak at 2?  = 22.5\u00ba, and from the \n\n(101) and (10 ) plane, peak at (13-18\u00ba), and Atotal is the area below the whole region in the XRD spectra \n\nrepresenting the amorphous material in the cellulosic fibres.  \n\n8.2.4.3 Fibre diameter and density \n\nThe diameter measurements of sisal fibres with and without chemical treatment were made in five \n\nspaced locations along the gauge length of each specimen using an optical microscope Olympus BH-2 \n\n(Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an Olympus DP11, (Japan) digital camera. A histogram for each type of \n\nsisal fibre was performed and a normal distribution to characterize and compare the properties of the \n\nfibre with and without chemical treatment. The density of the sisal fibres was determined according to \n\nthe standard ASTM D 792, using an analytical balance equipped with a stationary support for the \n\nimmersion vessel. Five fibres were weighted per condition. \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \u2013 Hybrid cork-polymer composites containing sisal fibre: Morphology, effect of the fibre \n\ntreatment on the mechanical properties and tensile failure prediction \n\n \n\n258 \n\n8.2.4.4 Thermal degradation \n\nThermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed to understand the degradation characteristics of the \n\nsisal fibres and confirm the chemical modification. The thermal stability was determined using a TGA \n\nQ500 series thermogravimetric analyser (TA Instruments, USA). Experiments were performed in \n\nplatinum pans, at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C.min-1 from 50 \u00b0C to 600 \u00b0C under nitrogen atmosphere. All \n\ntests were repeated once. \n\n8.2.4.5 Mechanical properties of sisal fibres \n\nSingle fibre tensile tests were measured with a Instron 4505 Universal Machine, (USA) using a 1 kN \n\nload cell, a crosshead speed of 1 mm.min?1, and a fibre gauge length of 30 mm. Prior to testing, fibres \n\nwere mounted on sturdy paper frames using a high-strength hot melt glue and placed in a desiccators \n\nfor a minimum period of 48 h. The tensile properties of the single sisal fibres were determined \n\naccording to the standard ASTM C 1557. \n\n8.2.5 Morphology of the fibres and the composites \n\nThe morphological characterization of the natural fibres and the developed reinforced cork polymer \n\ncomposites fracture surface were examined using a NanoSEM 200 FEI (The Netherlands) scanning \n\nelectron microscope (SEM). Before being analysed all the samples were coated by ion sputtering with \n\nan Au/Pd alloy (80-20 wt. %) in a high resolution sputter coater of Cressington 208HR (Watford, UK). \n\n8.2.6 Mechanical properties of composites \n\n8.2.6.1 Tensile tests \n\nThe tensile properties of the developed cork based composites reinforced with sisal fibres were \n\ndetermined in the same machine according the standard ISO 527\u20132. The tensile bars had a neck \n\ncross-section area of 3 \u00d7 4 mm2 and a neck length of 20 mm. The tensile force was taken as the \n\nmaximum force in the force deformation curve. Tensile modulus was estimated from the initial slope of \n\nthe stress\u2013strain curve (between 0.05 and 1% strain) using the linear regression method. Samples were \n\nconditioned at room temperature for at least 48 h before testing. A crosshead speed of 5 mm.min?1 was \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \u2013 Hybrid cork-polymer composites containing sisal fibre: Morphology, effect of the fibre \n\ntreatment on the mechanical properties and tensile failure prediction \n\n \n\n259 \n\nused up to a strain at break. The average and standard deviations were determined using eight \n\nspecimens per condition.  \n\n8.2.6.2 Flexural tests \n\nThree point static flexural tests were carried out in accordance with standard ISO 178. The dimensions \n\nof the specimens used were 132 mm length, 13 mm width and 6 mm depth. The load was placed \n\nmidway between the supports with a span (L) of 80 mm. The crosshead speed was 2.56 mm/min. The \n\ntested specimens were performed in an Instron 4505 Universal Machine (USA) equipped with a 1 kN \n\ncell load. For each condition, the specimens were loaded until the core break. The average and \n\nstandard deviations were determined using 7 specimens.  \n\n8.2.7 Statistical analysis \n\nThe values obtained by tensile and flexural tests were analysed by the normality of the distribution of \n\nthe mechanical results was evaluated using Shapiro-WilK test to evaluate their normal distribution at \n\np<0.05. The means were compared using a Two-Sample t-Test or the non-parametric Kolmogorov-\n\nSmirnov (K-S) test and differences were considered significantly different at p<0.05 (*). Additionally and \n\nin order to predict the failure probability of the developed hybrid cork composites the values obtained \n\nfrom the tensile tests were statistically analysed by using the two-parameter Weibull model, where the \n\ncumulative distribution function is given by [29]: \n\n? ?\n?\n\n? ??\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n??\n\nx\n\nxF exp1  , for x ? 0   (8.2)  \n\n \n\nwhere F(x) is the probability of failure of a composite material subjected to a stress level x. In equation \n\n(2), ? and ? are two constants to be determined, known as the \u201cscale parameter\u201d or \u201ccharacteristic \n\nstrength\u201d and the \u201cshaper parameter\u201d, respectively. Finally the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was employed \n\nto evaluate the goodness-of-fit to the data points. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \u2013 Hybrid cork-polymer composites containing sisal fibre: Morphology, effect of the fibre \n\ntreatment on the mechanical properties and tensile failure prediction \n\n \n\n260 \n\n8.3 Results and Discussion \n\n8.3.1 Sisal fibre properties \n\n8.3.1.1 Chemical characterization \n\nNatural fibres are chemically treated to remove lignin, pectin and waxy substances covering the external \n\nsurface of the fibre cell wall [30]. The chemical composition change at the sisal fibre surface structure \n\nby the chemical treatment was characterized using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Figure 8.2 shows the \n\nspectra region between 800 and 2000 cm-1 relative to unmodified fibre (Sisal), alkali treatment \n\n(Sisal_NaOH) which   revealed that some changes did occur. In agreement with other previous works, \n\nthe significant weight loss of sisal fibre after alkali treatment (see Table 8.3) can be attributed to the \n\npartial dissolution of hemicellulose [31], lignin and pectin [11]. The FTIR spectra confirm the \n\ndisappearance of the carbonyl band (between 1660 and 1760 cm-1), when the fibre was treated with \n\nNaOH. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8.2.

The slightly diminished intensity of around \n\n1610 cm-1 for the treated fibres could be attributed to the removal of some aromatic lignin-like \n\nimpurities [31]. \n\n8.3.1.2 Crystallinity \n\nThe result of X-ray diffraction present in Figure 8.3 reflects the influence of the surface treatment on the \n\nsisal fibres between the amorphous and crystalline regions. \n\n \n\nFigure 8.3. X-ray diffraction spectra of sisal untreated and alkali treated sisal fibres. \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \u2013 Hybrid cork-polymer composites containing sisal fibre: Morphology, effect of the fibre \n\ntreatment on the mechanical properties and tensile failure prediction \n\n \n\n262 \n\nThe spectra were almost similar; however, alkali-treated fibre peaks were more intense than untreated \n\nsisal peaks, which mean that the chemical treatment was able to remove part of the amorphous \n\nmaterial covering the fibre, thus exposing the cellulose. Table 8.3 shows that a small increase on the \n\ncellulose crystallinity (% Cr) occurred when the sisal fibre was submitted to chemical treatment. The \n\nuntreated sisal fibre has a %Cr of 24.1% that increases to 29.6% after chemical modification with NaOH. \n\nWhen the sisal fibre receives the alkali solution chemical treatment, the crystalline fraction of cellulose \n\nincreased due to the partial elimination of  lignin during alkaline treatment, losing part of its amorphous \n\ncomponent [11]. This result is in accordance with the FTIR analysis. In the literature it is also indicated \n\nthat thermal treatments on sisal fibres does not change significantly the chemical composition for \n\ntemperatures below 200 \u00baC and increases the degree of crystallinity [32], therefore it is also expected \n\nthe occurrence of this phenomenon during the melt based processes of extrusion and compression \n\nmoulding involving the use of sisal fibres. \n\n8.3.1.3 Diameter, density and morphology \n\nThe fibre diameter variation and its morphology of both sisal fibres are present in Figure 8.4 and in \n\nTable 8.3. The Figure 8.4 refers to the diameter variation of the fibres in terms of mean and standard \n\ndeviation, where the average fibre diameter decreases slightly with the surface treatment. Taking in \n\nconsideration the Gaussian fit curve obtained from the histograms performed for the sisal fibres and \n\npresented in Figure 8.4a), the unmodified sisal fibre presents a diameter of [117.3 - 234.5? ?m for a \n\nconfidence interval of 95%. The diameter of the Sisal_NaOH fibre presented in Figure 8.4c) was smaller \n\nthan the unmodified sisal ranging from [85.3 \u2013 197.7? ?m due to the alkali chemical treatment. The \n\nsmall increase on density was observed probably due to increase of the crystallinity after chemical \n\ntreatment. In terms of morphology, the sisal fibre (Figure 8.4 b) consists of aligned fibrils with materials \n\ncementing the fibres together. After the chemical treatment a small reduction on the cell wall and fibre \n\ndiameter (see Figure 8.4 d) was noticed. The alkali treatment leads to fibrillation of the fibre bundle into \n\nsmaller fibres, reducing the diameter and increases the roughness [10].  After chemical treatment of \n\nthe fibres, seems to be cleaner when compared with the unmodified sisal fibres.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \u2013 Hybrid cork-polymer composites containing sisal fibre: Morphology, effect of the fibre \n\ntreatment on the mechanical properties and tensile failure prediction \n\n \n\n263 \n\n \n\nFigure 8.4.

The TGA of \n\nthe sisal fibre shows a two-step degradation process with a initial transition around 100\u00b0C is due to \n\nmoisture evaporation. Cellulose is the main constituent of the cell wall of several lignocellulosic fibres \n\nsuch as wood and sisal. It is established in wood that the cellulose contains numerous hydroxyl groups \n\nthat are strongly hydrophilic [33].  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \u2013 Hybrid cork-polymer composites containing sisal fibre: Morphology, effect of the fibre \n\ntreatment on the mechanical properties and tensile failure prediction \n\n \n\n264 \n\n  \n\nFigure 8.5. TGA curves of untreated and treated sisal fibres (a) and respective derivative curves (b). \n\n \n\nIn the inset graph of Figure 8.5 a) evidences the lower moisture content in the fibres after alkali \n\ntreatment that induces the hydrophobicity of the fibre. The onset degradation temperature of the alkali \n\ntreated fibre is very similar to the untreated sisal fibre. With the TGA was possible to confirm that the \n\nchemical modification does not induce a negative effect on the thermal resistance of the fibres. Figure \n\n8.5 b) presents the derivative curve and was noticed in the fibre with alkali treatment the disappearing \n\nof the shoulder around 296 \u2013 298 \u00baC that is attributed to the removal the hemicellulose [34], while \n\nlignin decomposition extended to the whole range from 200 \u00baC until 700 \u00baC, due to different activities of \n\nthe chemical bonds present on its structure [11, 35]. The more intense degradation peak around \n\n351\u00baC to 364 \u00b0C presented in both fibres could derive from the degradation of cellulosic components \n\npresent on the sisal fibres. In terms of residual mass at 595 \u00baC the sisal fibre presents 19.8% \n\ncomparing with 24.2% for the alkali sisal treatment. \n\n8.3.1.5 Mechanical properties of sisal fibres \n\nThe tensile properties of the single sisal fibre before and after chemical treatment are presented in \n\nTable 8.4. It is clear the higher tensile properties of the sisal fibre comparing to the thermoplastic \n\npolymers such polyethylene and polypropylene. Comparing the properties between the different fibres \n\nthe mean values of maximum strength of the unmodified sisal is higher compared with the modified \n\nfibres. This may be related with the alkali chemical treatment that promoted the reduction of the fibre \n\nthickness and some removing of the hemicelluloses and lignin as discussed in the chemical \n\ncharacterization, promoting a more intense yellow colour to the sisal fibre.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \u2013 Hybrid cork-polymer composites containing sisal fibre: Morphology, effect of the fibre \n\ntreatment on the mechanical properties and tensile failure prediction \n\n \n\n265 \n\nTable 8.4.

The fracture morphology of the cork based composites after tensile \n\ntests, obtained by scanning electron microscopy is presented in Figure 8.6. In the micrographs of \n\nFigure 8.6 a) and b) it is possible to observe the good adhesion between the cork and the polymeric \n\nmatrix promoted by the use of the coupling agent. When the sisal fibres are added to the cork-polymer \n\nwithout the use of coupling agent (Figure 8.6 c and d), the fracture reveal voids from the pull-out of the \n\nsisal fibre indicating lower adhesion between the sisal fibres to the matrix. Additionally and at high \n\nmagnification it was also observed the polymeric phase presents some stretching as compared with the \n\nprevious composite CPC 2. Similar observation after mechanical tests was registered in a previous work \n\nusing cork based composites obtained by pultrusion (pellets) follow by compression moulding [16]. \n\nRegarding the fibres with the alkali treatment we clearly observe at high magnification (Figure 8.6 f) \n\nparticles of cork that are in contact along to the sisal fibre and there is a good linkage between the \n\nfibres and the matrix. The improvement of the adhesion was obtained by the combine effect of the low \n\namount of coupling agent 2 wt% and the chemical modification of the sisal fibres. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \u2013 Hybrid cork-polymer composites containing sisal fibre: Morphology, effect of the fibre \n\ntreatment on the mechanical properties and tensile failure prediction \n\n \n\n266 \n\n \n\nFigure 8.6.

Figure 8.7 summarizes the obtained properties, in terms of tensile modulus and maximum \n\nstrength for the composites with polyethylene matrix.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8.7. Mechanical properties of the reinforced cork-polymer composites with sisal fibres, when \n\nsubmitted to uniaxial tensile load. (*) Significant at 0.05; ns: non-significant at 0.05. \n\n \n\nThe statistical significance between samples with and without sisal fibre reinforcement was compared, \n\nbeing CPC 2 the cork-polymer composite reinforced with 2 wt.% of coupling agent. Considering the data \n\nof Figure 8.7, it is clear the effect of the coupling agent on the increase in terms of tensile strength \n\n(16.8%) for the composites CPC 1 and CPC 2 containing polymer and cork as main constituents. This \n\nresult it is in agreement with a previous study [17] when it was used 50 wt.% of cork powder from \n\ndifferent industrial processes by pultrusion and compression moulding on the development of \n\ncomposites. The addition of 10 wt.% of unmodified sisal fibre (CPC 3), leads to a significant \n\nreinforcement in terms of modulus of 23%. Additionally, the sisal fibres and the cork act as filler since it \n\nreduces the strength due to the increase of the natural component on the hybrid composite. CPC 4 \n\npresents the same composition as CPC 3 where the difference was the two extrusion step process to \n\nproduce the composite pellets. The cork-polymer were first compounded into composite pellets and \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \u2013 Hybrid cork-polymer composites containing sisal fibre: Morphology, effect of the fibre \n\ntreatment on the mechanical properties and tensile failure prediction \n\n \n\n268 \n\nthen short sisal fibres were added in the cork-polymer composite pellets, to produce the hybrid \n\nreinforced composite. We observed that no improvements were noticed when we used a two-step \n\nextrusion process to produce the same hybrid composites. CPC 5 and CPC 6 are similar in terms of \n\ncomposition (see Table 8.2), where the important difference was the fibre treatment. Regarding the \n\nCPC 5 we can observe that the addition of 10 wt.% of sisal fibres in the presence of coupling agent 2 \n\nwt.% improved significantly both stiffness  in 22% and the tensile strength in 28% of the hybrid \n\ncomposite. The improvement on the tensile properties was even higher by using the alkali treated sisal \n\nfibres, being 29 and 49% respectively due to the chemical surface modification and increase of surface \n\nroughness. Comparing with the polyethylene matrix, the developed hybrid cork based composites \n\npresents similar modulus values but a reduced strength performance. In the literature it is pointed that \n\nthe use of coupling agents based on maleic anhydride (MA) increases the tensile strength of the \n\ncomposites due to the esterification reaction between sisal fibre hydroxyl groups and anhydride part \n\nwhich causes a reduction in interfacial tension and an increase in interfacial adhesion between \n\nthermoplastic and the fibre [36]. Similar hydroxyl groups are present in the chemical composition of \n\ncork and sisal fibres. The combined effect of the sisal fibre treatment with the presence of coupling \n\nagent based on MA for effective stress transfer across the interface enhances the adhesion between the \n\ninterphases and consequently reinforces the tensile properties of the hybrid cork-polymer composites. \n\n8.3.3.2 Flexural tests \n\nFigure 8.8 displays representative stress-strain curves of the polyethylene matrix and the prepared cork \n\ncomposites with and without the reinforcement of sisal fibres after a three-point bending test. Figure 8.9 \n\npresents the corresponding flexural modulus and the maximum strength mean values with the \n\nrespective standard deviation for comparison.  Similar to the tensile behaviour results of the composites, \n\nthe addition of 10 wt.% of sisal fibre without coupling agent (CPC 3) improves the stiffness; however it \n\nreduces significantly the flexural strength (see Figure 8.9) and reduces the strain at break as showing in \n\nFigure 8.8. The addition of coupling agent promotes mainly the flexural strength and the elongation at \n\nbreak (CPC 5). After chemical modification the resulting sisal fibres present a rough surface topography, \n\nwith removal of surface impurities and removal of hydrophilic hydroxyl groups [30] improving the affinity \n\nwith the thermoplastic matrix. The combined effect of the chemical modification of sisal and the use of \n\n2 wt.% of coupling agent (CPC 6) result in  hybrid composites with enhanced flexural performance. \n\nComparing with the unreinforced composite CPC 1, it has higher stiffness 33%, higher flexural strength \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \u2013 Hybrid cork-polymer composites containing sisal fibre: Morphology, effect of the fibre \n\ntreatment on the mechanical properties and tensile failure prediction \n\n \n\n269 \n\n98% and higher elongation at break due to the improvement on the interfacial adhesion between the \n\nmatrix and the natural component.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8.8.

In the literature it was \n\nfound that the sisal fibre after alkali modification improves the dispersion of the fibres but not their \n\nadhesion to the polymer matrix, due to a higher availability of OH groups in the particles surface [37]. \n\nAlkali treatment may leads to fibre fibrillation i.e. breaking down of fibre bundles into smaller fibres; \n\nwhich increases the surface area available for contact with the matrix [32]. The treatment is in \n\naccordance with the morphology results obtained, leading to a considerable enhancement on the \n\nmechanical properties. Higher improvements might be achieved by using higher amount of the natural \n\nfibre based in the presence of coupling agent. However, the high increase of the viscosity will make \n\ndifficult the melt based processes of formulations riches in natural materials based on fibres and \n\nparticles. \n\n8.3.4 Weibull statistical analysis \n\nTensile strength life distribution diagrams have been obtained by using the cumulative Weibull \n\ndistribution function (Eq. 2) for cork-polymer composite reinforced with sisal fibres. Figure 8.10 \n\npresents the reliability probability of survival (F) and can be found easily corresponding to any stress \n\nvalue from the diagram. The Weibull fit method was used to modelling the failure data of the hybrid \n\ncomposites when submitted to tensile load and compare the increase on the strength promoted by the \n\nsisal chemical modification. A very good agreement between the estimated strengths and experimental \n\nvalues is evident in Table 8.5, confirming the efficiency of the Weibull distribution in prediction the \n\ntensile strength failure properties of the developed hybrid composites. The tested composites present \n\nstrength higher than 12.65 MPa see Figure 8.10. Comparing the estimated strength or probability of \n\nfailure at 95% of confidence present in Table 8.5 for the cork-polymer composites (40-60) wt.%, the use \n\nof coupling agent improved in 20% the strength of the composite. The addition of the untreated sisal \n\nfibres with coupling agent (CPC 5) presents a higher improvement of 34% comparing with CPC 1 and \n\nan increase of 12% comparing with the CPC 2. The best results were obtained with sisal treated fibres, \n\nmostly using the sisal modified with NaOH that presents an increase of 55% and 30% comparing with \n\nthe CPC 1 and CPC 2, respectively. Several methods, such as Chi-square, the Anderson\u2013Darling test, \n\nallow to determine the goodness of fit of a probability distribution to a set of data [24, 38]. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \u2013 Hybrid cork-polymer composites containing sisal fibre: Morphology, effect of the fibre \n\ntreatment on the mechanical properties and tensile failure prediction \n\n \n\n271 \n\n \n\nFigure 8.10.

The procedure was partially adapted from [39]: \n\n(1) Since the K-S is a distance test, it was determined the maximum deviation Dn = Fn \u2013 F0 and Dn- \n\n= F0 \u2013 Fn-1. Being Fn the cumulative observed values and F0 the Weibull cumulative distribution \n\nfunction present in the equation 2. \n\n(2) K-S tables of critical values (CV) are valid when the distribution parameters are known. Since \n\nthe distribution parameters were estimated from the experimental data the CV will be 4 ? ? \n\nvalue [24], i.e. for a significance level of ? = 0.05 that means ?\u00b4 = 0.20. For n=8 and a \n\nsignificance level of ? = 0.05, the Dnc = 0.358. \n\n(3) If Dn &lt;Dnc, the null hypothesis that the observed data follow the Weibull distribution is accepted. \n\nThe Weibull parameters and K-S goodness-of-fit test are listed in Table 8.5. The K-S statistic Dn values \n\npresented in Table 8.5 and obtained after the test are between 0.17 and 0.23, indicating that the \n\ntensile strength of the developed hybrid composites is strongly explained by the Weibull cumulative \n\ndistribution because it departs significantly from the value of significance level ? = 0.05 and a sample \n\nsize of n=8 for which the K-S of fit test was performed. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \u2013 Hybrid cork-polymer composites containing sisal fibre: Morphology, effect of the fibre \n\ntreatment on the mechanical properties and tensile failure prediction \n\n \n\n272 \n\nTable 8.5.

The improvement on the mechanical properties was effective when a 2 wt.% of \n\ncoupling agent based on maleic anhydride (MA) was used, since the mechanical properties increased in \n\nterms of stiffness, strength and elongation at break.  The improvement of the interfacial adhesion \n\nbetween the matrix, the cork and sisal fibres was also confirmed by the fracture morphology. In terms \n\nof processing to obtain the hybrid CPC pellets, there is no advantage in the use of two melt extrusion \n\nsteps and add the sisal fibres only in the second step. This study demonstrates that the mechanical \n\nproperties of CPC can be improved by: 1) the addition of a 2 wt.% of the coupling agent based on MA; \n\n2) the sisal fibres addition (10 wt.%) without the use of a coupling agent, resulting in a hybrid CPC with \n\nsimilar modulus properties and with lower thermoplastic content and 3) by the  combined effect of the \n\naddition of alkali treated sisal fibres with the use of the coupling agent resulting in composites with \n\nconsiderably higher mechanical properties. Under flexural load and using alkali treated sisal fibres with \n\ncoupling agent in the new composites an increase of 33% in modulus and an increase of 98% in \n\nstrength were obtained when compared with unreinforced cork composites. Comparing the improved \n\nmechanical properties of the hybrid CPC with the polyethylene matrix, it was possible to reinforce the \n\nmatrix in terms of stiffness and strength at flexural load manly after the sisal fibres alkali treatment. In \n\nterms of tensile strength, they present similar stiffness and lower strength when compared to the \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \u2013 Hybrid cork-polymer composites containing sisal fibre: Morphology, effect of the fibre \n\ntreatment on the mechanical properties and tensile failure prediction \n\n \n\n273 \n\npolyethylene matrix. The Weibull diagram was used to reliably identify the composites safety limits. The \n\ntensile strength of the hybrid reinforced CPC was found to be in agreement with the Weibull cumulative \n\ndistribution, which can be used to accurately predict the mechanical performances in terms of strength \n\nof the developed hybrid cork composite materials.  \n\n8.5 References \n\n[1] Kalia S, Kaith BS, Kaur I.

The lignocellulosic biomass was compounded with poly(L-lactic acid), \n\n(PLLA); polyhydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate, (PHBV); poly-?-caprolactone (PCL) and starch-poly-?-\n\ncaprolactone (SPCL) using twin-screw extruder prior to injection moulding into tensile samples. The cork \n\nbiocomposites were engineered to satisfy acceptable stiffness, strength, and in-service durability while \n\nmaintaining the tendency for rapid out-of-service biodegradation. The physico-mechanical and \n\nmorphological properties and thermal stability of the matrices and the bio-based cork composites were \n\ninvestigated. Moreover, the biodegradability of the materials under static water immersion and in soil \n\nburial tests was also monitored. This study shows that cork contributes to lightweight composite \n\nmaterials using PLLA and PHBV matrices and promotes an increase on the stiffness of PCL. Cork \n\nincreases the thermal stability and the crystallinity degree of the biocomposites. The weight loss, \n\nthickness variation and the reduction in tensile properties of biodegradable composite in soil are \n\nsignificantly greater than those in water. The materials present low water absorption and the highest \n\nvalues corresponded to the biocomposites. The presence of cork contributes for the initial degradation; \n\nhowever at long time it slows the biodegradation rate due to cork microbial resistance. As expected, the \n\nuse of starch biomass accelerates the biodegradation rate of the materials. Composites using \n\nbiodegradable polymers with cork will contribute to increasing their market acceptance and for the \n\ndevelopment of novel sustainable products. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n8\n This chapter is based on the following publication: \n\nFernandes EM, Correlo VM, Mano JF, Reis RL, 2013, Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, \n\nmechanical, morphological and thermal properties, submitted. \n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological \n\nand thermal properties \n\n \n\n279 \n\n9.1 Introduction \n\nLignocellulosic biomass represents a renewable, biodegradable, lightweight, abundant and cheap \n\nsource of raw, making them attractive for the development of sustainable products [1-5]. Cork is the \n\nouter bark of an oak tree known botanically as Quercus suber L; being the major chemical constituents \n\nsuberin (33-50%); lignin (13-29%); polysaccharides, (6-25%); and extractives (8.5-24%) [6, 7]. Cork \n\nreveals an anisotropic closed cellular structure as shown in Figure 9.1. It is composed of an aggregate \n\nof cells, about 42 million per cubic centimeter [8]. Cork is a lightweight material, elastic and \n\nimpermeable to liquids or gases, good thermal, acoustic and electrical insulator, sound and vibration \n\ninsulator and exhibits a near-zero Poisson coefficient, which found applications from the stoppers to \n\naeronautics [6, 9-11]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9.1. SEM micrographs of the 3D cork morphology  showing in detail the non-radial direction (NR) \n\nand radial direction (R). \n\n \n\nFurthermore, cork composites are one of the most promising fields of cork technology [9]. The \n\ncombination of cork biomass with polymers trough melt based technologies brought added-value to cork \n\nbased materials that can open a wide range of innovative applications. Studies can be found on the \n\ncombination of cork and cork by-products with polyolefins such as polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene \n\n(PP) and the effect of coupling agent in the mechanical properties [12, 13], chemical surface \n\nmodification to improve cork-polymer compatibility [14] and hybrid cork composite systems reinforced \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological \n\nand thermal properties \n\n \n\n280 \n\nwith natural fibres [15-17]. Recently, the combination of the unique properties of cork with \n\nbiodegradable matrices [18, 19] was also evolved to the production of more sustainable materials \n\ncontaining cork. A sustainable product is a product which will gives as little impact on the environment \n\nas possible during its life cycle [20]. One of the main drawbacks pointed to composites is the low \n\nsustainability due to the separation problems of the mixed materials [20]. One interesting approach is \n\nto consider the re-manufacturing of old products or the use of biodegradable polymers as matrices \n\ncombined usually with biofibres as reinforcing element, to produce fully biodegradable materials, the so \n\ncalled biocomposites or green composites [1, 5, 21]. \n\nBiodegradable polymers and bio-based plastic products from renewal resources can form sustainable \n\nand eco-friendly products than can compete in the current market [4, 5, 22]. The worldwide capacity of \n\nbio-based plastics is expected to increase from 0.36 million metric ton (2007) to 2.33 million metric ton \n\nby 2013 and to 3.45 million metric ton in 2020 [2]. From the different biodegradable polymers it was \n\ndefined 4 classes [23]: The agro-polymers (e.g. polysaccharides) obtained from biomass by \n\nfractionation such as starch and lignocellulosic products. The second and third are polyesters, obtained, \n\nrespectively by fermentation from biomass or from genetically modified plants (e.g. \n\npolyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), including polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)) and by synthesis from monomers \n\nobtained from biomass (e.g. polylactic acid (PLA)). The fourth family are polyesters, totally synthesized \n\nby the petrochemical process (e.g. polycaprolactone (PCL)) [1, 3, 23]. The interest of these polymers \n\nhas grown, since they present similar mechanical and thermal properties as compared with synthetic \n\nthermoplastic such as polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) [24]. The PLA and PHB reveal higher \n\nmechanical properties, with a modulus around 2.8 to 3.4 GPa and 1.0 to 2.1 GPa respectively [2, 4, \n\n25]. The aliphatic polyesters present proper mechanical and degradation properties that make them \n\ngood candidates for several applications [21].  \n\nThe aim of this study was to produce and characterize different renewable resource derived-\n\nbiocomposites based on, poly(L-lactic acid), (PLLA); polyhydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate, (PHBV); \n\nPCL and starch-poly-?-caprolactone (SPCL) combined with granulated cork through twin-screw extrusion \n\nfollowed by injection moulding. We hypothesized that by combining proper melt based technologies this \n\nstudy can provide information for basic properties of several cork biocomposites, as well as their major \n\ncharacteristics and degradation behavior under static water and soil burial conditions. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological \n\nand thermal properties \n\n \n\n281 \n\n9.2 Experimental section \n\n9.2.1 Cork and polymer materials \n\nCork granules, with an average particle size 0.5-1mm and specific weight of 166 \u00b1 21 kg m-3, moisture \n\nof ~7.5 % was supplied by Amorim Revestimentos S.A. (S. Paio Oleiros, Portugal). The polymers used \n\nin the preparation of the cork based composites includes: i) PLLA used had L-lactide content of 99.6 % \n\nand a Mw of 69 000 g.mol-1, and was obtained from Cargill Dow LLC, USA; ii) PHBV polymer with 12% \n\nHV content and molecular weight (Mw) of approximately 425 692 g.mol-1 was provided by PHB Industrial, \n\nSerrana, Brazil; iii) PCL resin (commercially available as TONE\u00ae 787), with Mw of 125 000 g.mol-1, was \n\nobtained from Union Carbide Chemicals and Plastics Division, New Jersey, USA and iv) A blend of corn \n\nstarch with PCL 30/70 wt.% (SPCL) was supplied by Novamont, Italy. It contained about 63 wt.% of \n\nPCL, 27 wt.% of corn starch and 10 wt.% of natural plasticizers. The Mw of PCL present in this blend is \n\nabout 118 000 g.mol-1. \n\n9.2.2 Twin-screw extrusion compounding \n\nPrior to compounding all natural raw materials were pre-dried at 40 to 70 \u00baC during 24 h to stabilise in \n\nterms of moisture content and the polymers were thereafter reduced to a grain size less than 0.5 mm \n\nin a Ultra centrifugal mill from Retsch. The prepared compositions and processing conditions are \n\nsummarized in Table 9.1. The raw materials were pre-mixed and then were compounded in a Rondol \n\nSCF modular co-rotating twin-screw extruder (TSE) with the screws diameter of 16 mm, a length to \n\ndiameter ratio (L/D) = 25 and a single strand die of 3 mm. The mixture was placed in the hopper and \n\nautomatically feeded at a constant rate with a volumetric dosing unit from SHINI Plastics Technologies \n\n(Germany). The temperature profile along the barrel to the die and the rotation screws was set \n\naccording to the information present in Table 9.1. Part of the extrudate was cooled in water bath and \n\nsubsequently ground by a lab pelletizer SCHEER (Stuttgart) to produce composite pellets with length ? \n\n5 mm suitable for injection moulding. Prior to this step, the produced pellets were dried in a vacuum \n\noven at 50 \u00baC until stabilize. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological \n\nand thermal properties \n\n \n\n282 \n\nTable 9.1.

The injection-moulded specimens were tensile bars \n\nproduced according ASTM 638, with 60 mm length, a constant rectangular cross-section of 2\u00d74 mm2, \n\nand a neck length of 20 mm. The samples were placed in polyethylene plastic bags and conditioned at \n\nambient temperature.  \n\n9.2.4 Degradation testing \n\nThe degradation tests involved both water and soil degradation tests. The water degradation tests were \n\nperformed to determine the dimensional stability of the injection moulded specimens and to access to \n\nsome biodegradability and the soil degradation tests were performed to monitoring the evolution of \n\nbiodegradability of the specimens under soil conditions. \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological \n\nand thermal properties \n\n \n\n283 \n\n9.2.4.1 Water degradation tests \n\nThe dimensional stability tests included measurements of water absorption (WA), thickness swelling \n\n(TS), weight loss (WL) and moisture content (MC). The WA, TS and MC were measured according to the \n\nASTM D 570. The specimens, previously obtained by injection moulding, were dried at 40 \u00baC in a \n\nvacuum oven during 48 h, stabilized in desiccator and the MC of the specimens was calculated as \n\nfollows: \n\n \n\n   (1) \n\n \n\nwhere Ww is the weight of the specimen before drying (g) and Wd is the weight of the sample after drying \n\n(g).  \n\nFigure 9.2 a) represents the scheme of the water degradation tests. Each individual specimen was \n\nplaced in a falcon tube containing 14 ml of distilled water. The water absorption (WA) was calculated by \n\nweighting the samples before and after immersed in distilled water at room temperature (23 \u00baC).

The weight loss (WL) of the specimens was calculated as follows: \n\n \n\n   (4) \n\n \n\nwhere Wi is the initial weight of the specimen (g) and Wd is the weight of the sample after drying (g). For \n\nthat purpose, the specimens were weighed using an analytical balance after being placed in a vacuum \n\noven at 40 \u00baC for 48 h, cooled and stabilized in a desiccator several days followed by reweighing of the \n\nspecimens. Averages of 5 specimens in each time point were used for TS, WA, MC and WL \n\nmeasurements. \n\n9.2.4.2 Soil degradation tests \n\nThe injection moulded matrices and the biocomposite specimens were placed in vessels of 5 L used as \n\nsoil containers and buried in soil.

The average room temperature was 19 \u2013 21 \u00baC and relative \n\nhumidity was kept at least 50 % by pulverizing the soil with distilled water and allowing continuous \n\naeration. Once removed, samples were withdrawn carefully, placed in small nets to avoid disintegration \n\nof the specimen and washed with distilled water. After that, the samples where dried at 40 \u00baC in a \n\nvacuum oven to constant weight and kept in a desiccator, and then measured in terms of thickness \n\nvariation and weight loss before undergo to further characterization.

Before being analysed all the samples were coated by ion sputtering with an Au/Pd \n\nalloy (80-20 wt. %) in a high resolution sputter coater of Cressington 208HR (Watford, UK). \n\n9.2.7 Mechanical properties \n\nTensile properties of the injection moulded specimens before and after water and soil degradation tests \n\nwere measured using an Instron 4505 Universal Machine, (USA) according to the standard ASTM D \n\n638. The tests were conducted using a 1 kN load cell, with a gauge length of 20 mm and a crosshead \n\nspeed of 5 mm.min?1 until rupture. The tensile force was taken as the maximum stress in the stress-\n\nstrain curve. Tensile modulus was estimated from the initial slope of the stress\u2013strain curve (between \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological \n\nand thermal properties \n\n \n\n286 \n\n0.5 and 1% strain) using the linear regression method. Samples were conditioned at room temperature \n\nfor at least 48 h before testing. The average and standard deviations were determined using 5 \n\nspecimens per condition.  \n\n9.2.8 Thermal properties \n\nThermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed to understand the degradation characteristics of the \n\ndeveloped composites and their matrices. The thermal stability was determined using a TGA Q500 \n\nseries thermogravimetric analyser (TA Instruments, USA). Experiments were performed in platinum \n\npans, at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C.min-1 from 50 \u00b0C to 600 \u00b0C under nitrogen atmosphere. All tests were \n\nrepeated once. \n\nDifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements of the moulded specimens was assessed by \n\nDSC in a Perkin-Elmer, Pyris Diamond system at 20 \u00baC min-1 under nitrogen atmosphere. The DSC \n\nscans were performed in bulk specimens cut from the central part of the rectangular cross-section of \n\nthe tensile specimens. The glass transition temperature (Tg), cold crystallization temperature (Tcc), \n\nmelting temperature (Tm) and total enthalpy (?H) of all injection moulded materials were identified. The \n\ndegree of crystallinity (?c) was calculated on the basis of a 100% crystalline a melting enthalpy of (?H\u00bam) \n\nof the used polymer and according to the Eq. (5): \n\n \n\n  (5) \n\n \n\nwhere ?Hcc is the enthalpy of cold crystallization before melting; ?Hm the enthalpy of melting and w is \n\nthe weight fraction of the non-polymeric part in the composite. All the samples were repeated at least \n\nonce. \n\n9.3 Results and discussion \n\n9.3.1 Degradation properties \n\nThe physical properties of the injection moulded specimens include the moisture content (MC), water \n\nabsorption (WA), thickness swelling (TS) and weight loss (WL) after water degradation tests and the WL \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological \n\nand thermal properties \n\n \n\n287 \n\nand TS after soil degradation tests. Additionally, it was measure the density of the specimens to \n\ndetermine the effect of the presence of 30 wt.% of cork on the produced materials. \n\nFigure 9.3 shows the schematic representation of the potential benefits of utilization renewable cork as \n\nforest biomass in bio-based products. In the scheme it is visualized the injection moulded specimens \n\nused in the tests. \n\n \n\nFigure 9.3. Schematic diagram of cycle from the cork bark to the biocomposite cap as prototype.  \n\n \n\nWe also present a fully bio-based polyerter cap for wine sealing with 30 wt.% of granulated cork \n\nobtained by injection moulding as prof of concept and as one of the potential uses for the developed \n\nfully natural products. \n\n \n\n9.3.1.1 Water degradation tests \n\nThe MC of injection moulded specimens is present in Figure 9.4. It was observed the presence of some \n\nmoisture in the specimens preferably in the biocomposites with cork. In the case of the biocomposites \n\ncontaining PLLA, PHBV and PCL as matrices the MC varied between 0.37 \u00b1 0.03 and 0.55 \u00b1 0.12 %. \n\nThe SPCL matrix presents the high MC since the biomass starch is sensitive to moisture. In this case, \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological \n\nand thermal properties \n\n \n\n288 \n\nthe biocomposite containing SPCL as matrix showed a reduction in the MC of 0.25% where the \n\nhydrophobic character of cork promoted some stability to the material.  \n\n \n\nFigure 9.4. Moisture contentin  the biodegradable polyesters and in the corresponding biocomposites \n\nafter injection moulding.  \n\n \n\nThe behaviour of the specimens after water immersion tests are presented in Figure 9.5, revealing the \n\nwater absorption (WA), weight loss (WL) and the thickness swelling (TS) variation in function of \n\nimmersion time. The WA of the specimens shown in Figure 9.5 a) and b) was more sharp for the \n\nbiocomposites containing 30 wt.% of cork. Since cork is a cellular material with closed cell structure [6, \n\n7], we suggest that the low water uptake up to 2 months is manly absorbed at the cork-polymer \n\ninterface and in the available lenticular channels across the cells of cork. The lenticular channels \n\nconstitute what is called the porosity of cork [7]. All the specimens tend to present higher values of \n\nwater uptake in the first 15 days and after this period tend to reduce or approach to equilibrium. The \n\nlower sorption capacity of biocomposites seems to be related to the type of the biodegradable polyester \n\nused and with some possible cork-matrix interaction. Furthermore, the processing methodology may \n\nplay an important role on the water absorption behaviour. In a recent study using PLA with 30 wt.% of \n\ncork powder compounding by melting mixing and followed by injection moulding, the materials \n\nexhibited WA values of 18% after 60 days [19]. In the present study, using a twin-screw extrusion \n\nfollowed by injection moulding, it WA was just 5.5 \u00b1 0.1% . It is expected that the cork powder instead of \n\nthe used granulated cork induced lower water resistance; however this difference of 3 times in the WA \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological \n\nand thermal properties \n\n \n\n289 \n\nshould also be the result of the processing methodology, revealing the adequated mixing effect \n\npromoted by the twin-screw extrusion process. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nFigure 9.5. Physical behaviour of the bio-based materials under water immersion tests: (a, b) water \n\nuptake, (c, d) weight loss and (e, f) thickness swelling variation.  \n\n \n\nThe SPCL blend contains around 30 wt.% of starch that is permeable to water, whereas the \n\nbiocomposite PCL/Cork contains the same weight fraction in cork particles. Comparing in terms of \n\nwater uptake in Figure 9.5 b), the absorption profile of the PCL/Cork biocomposite is more slowly in the \n\nfirst 7 days of immersion as compared with the SPCL. After a period of 2 weeks, they reach the \n\nmaximum absorption with similar values and tend to stabilize. Furthermore, the weight loss graphic in \n\nFigure 9.5 d) displays that PCL/cork does not reveal a significant weight loss and follows the same \n\ntrend as the PCL matrix, revealing a good physical interaction between cork and matrix. On the contrary, \n\nin the first 2 weeks of immersion, particles of starch are partially dissolved and released from the matrix \n\nsurface due a lower interaction between starch and PCL and the weight loss occurs showing some \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological \n\nand thermal properties \n\n \n\n290 \n\nappetence to biodegradation in static conditions. In addition, the literature has evidenced that \n\ndegradable synthetic polyesters, such as PCL are susceptible to hydrolytic degradation independently of \n\nthe crystallinity fraction, because the ester groups are separated by CH2 groups, which impart some \n\nflexibility to the chain [24]. This polymer is definitely biodegradable but only under outdoor conditions. \n\nFor instance, in the human body, it is slowly hydrolytically degradable [26]. Concerning the thickness \n\nswelling variation (TS) reported in Figure 9.5 f) the presence of starch tends to increase considerably \n\nthe TS since the starch swells when immersed in water expanding the biocomposite. After the first two \n\nweeks, the blend with starch showed lower TS due to the obtained WL. The starch is a water soluble \n\nmaterial [4, 27] and its consumption or release from the biocomposite might contribute to the decrease \n\nand stabilization of TS after the 30 days of immersion. The PLA and PHBV and its biocomposites does \n\nnot showed significant WL or TS variation after the 2 months of immersion. \n\n9.3.1.2  Soil degradation tests \n\nThe soil burial test can be considered a realistic approach to the biodegradation process in a waste \n\nlandfill. The biodegradability of the injection moulded specimens with 2 mm thick under indoor soil \n\nburial conditions was monitored during 6 months. The evolution of biodegradation at different periods of \n\ntime is shown in Figure 9.6 and the result of injection moulded specimens under test in Figure 9.7. The \n\nbiodegradation of a polymer is described as a process that comprises the deterioration of its physical \n\nand chemical properties and a reduction of its molecular mass due to its conversion into CO2, H2O, and \n\nCH4 along with other low molecular weight products under the influence of microorganisms in both \n\naerobic and anaerobic conditions [26]. The weight loss (WL) is one of is one of the most valuable data \n\nindicating the biodegradation of polymeric material after composting. Figure 9.6 a) and b) show that the \n\nWL of the specimens with PLLA and for the PLLA/Cork was negligible. Literature indicates that PLLA \n\ndecomposes completely in proper compost environment to yield carbon dioxide and biomass [28]. In \n\nthis work, the used soil and the temperature conditions may not be appropriated for the PLLA be \n\ndecomposed by microorganisms such as fungi or bacteria. The soil temperatures were much lower \n\n(19\u201321 \u00baC) than the minimum temperatures inducing biodegradation of PLA (30 \u00baC, but better 40 \u00baC \n\nand higher, i.e. 58 \u00baC) simulating conditions at municipal and industrial composting facilities [29]. This \n\nexplains why the rate of biodegradation of PLLA in burial soil conditions was rather low. After the period \n\nof 1 month the specimens containing PCL or SPCL as matrix starts to present a significant WL, around \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological \n\nand thermal properties \n\n \n\n291 \n\n11% up to 18.5%, being more intense for the blend containing starch. At this stage, the WL of the \n\nbiocomposites was lower since cork was not degraded. \n\n  \n\n  \n \n\nFigure 9.6. Physical behaviour of the bio-based materials under soil conditions: (a, b) weight loss and (c, \n\nd) thickness variation.  \n\n \n\nIncreasing the biodegradation time (2 months) lead to a WL of 10% for the PHBV and 8.5% for the \n\nPHBV/Cork, where in the case of the SPCL and its biocomposite the loss was around 40% of the initial \n\nweight. After 6 months, the biodegradationof the specimens decreased in the following order: \n\nSPCL/Cork > SPCL > PCL > PCL/Cork > PHBV/Cork > PHBV > PLLA/Cork and PLLA. At this stage a \n\nconsiderable increase on the WL for the PHBV and PHBV/Cork of 20% and 30% respectively was \n\nobtained. The biodegradation process of the injection moulded specimens was higher for the \n\nbiocomposites, where the only exception to this behaviour was the PCL and its biocomposite, probably \n\ndue to a chemical surface affinity between the ester groups present in cork and in the PCL monomer \n\nstructure. The biodegradation process of the specimens is ascribed to (a) the soil composition including \n\npH and soil temperature, (b) the hydrolytic degradation that are in contact with the produced materials \n\nand (c) the erosion process resulting in the release of the cork particles to the soil and the consequent \n\nhigher WL for the biocomposites as compared with the matrices. The literature comprises studies \n\nshowing that biodegradable polymers whether natural or synthetic materials may be susceptible to \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological \n\nand thermal properties \n\n \n\n292 \n\nmicrobial and/or enzymatic degradation depending wish the repetitive unit, morphology (e.g. \n\ncrystallinity and size of spherulites), hydrophilicity and surface area and presence of additives [30].  \n\nThe evolution of the biodegradation is clearly observed in Figure 9.7 were the PCL, SPCL and its \n\nbiocomposites loses the integrity accompanied by change in colour with the biodegradation process \n\nunder soil conditions. In this sense, the thickness variation of the specimens was also affected, see \n\nFigure 9.6 c) and d). The obtained results are consistent with the WL observations. The PLLA and the \n\nrespective biocomposite do not present reduction of thickness, whereas a small thickness reduction \n\nwas observed for the PHBV and its biocomposite. As expected the higher thickness variation was \n\nobserved for the PCL and SPCL compositions, where after the 60 days, it was not possible to obtain any \n\nmeasurements for the blend with starch due to a disintegration of the specimens. In addition, the small \n\nincrease in the thickness variation obtained for the SPCL/Cork after 30 days can be ascribed by the \n\nswelling of the starch leading to a faster WL followed by the disintegration of the composite structure. In \n\nspite of the results it is expected for the biocomposites a significantly lower rate of degradation at \n\ncompostable environmental conditions as compared with the neat polymers. \n\n \n\n \nControl 14 days 30 days 60 days 180 days \n\nPHBV \n\n \n\n \n\nPHBV/Cork \n\n \n\nPLLA \n\n \n\nPLLA/Cork \n\n \n\nPCL \n\n \n\nPCL/Cork \n\n \n\nSPCL \n\n \n\nSPCL/Cork \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9.7.

This behaviour is ascribed \n\nto the lower density of cork as compared with the used matrices. Lower density of the cork filled \n\ncomposites can result in increased specific mechanical properties (property/density). Moreover, \n\nfeatures such as: reduced weight, increasing of the amount of renewable material, reduced material \n\ncosts and the possibility to recycle are of considerable importance in the automotive industry. On the \n\ncontrary, the PCL matrix presents a lower density value of 1110 kg.m-3, where the addition of cork \n\nincreased the density in 4.5%. Comparing the effect of adding around 30 wt.% of starch  to the PCL (i.e. \n\nSPCL blend) and the same weight fraction of cork to the PCL (PCL/Cork composite) was obtained a \n\nreduction of 5.1%. This result reveals that the use of cork can be an environmental friendly approach to \n\nreduce the cost and promote aesthetic without compromise significantly the density of the PCL. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9.8.

Scale bar \n\nindicates 50 \u00b5m.  \n\n \n\nThe essays conducted under water just revealed two relevant conditions of biodegradation: (i) the \n\nmicrograph of PHBV after 60 days, presents smoother surface and some micro holes that justifies the \n\nsmall higher water uptake as compared with the PHBV/Cork biocomposite ; (ii) the SPCL micrograph \n\nafter the same 60 days of immersion presents some smaller micro holes (indicated with circles in the \n\nmicrograph) probably due to swelling and release of the starch particles from the surface. \n\nBiodegradation was found to occur primarily at the polymer surface and was more pronounced for the \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological \n\nand thermal properties \n\n \n\n296 \n\nburial soil specimens. SEM micrographs of Figure 9.9 show that after 60 days under soil, PLLA was not \n\naffected and PHBV starts to loose thickness. For the fully bio-based PHBV composite deep cracks are \n\nobserved, as well as cork exposure at the surface.  \n\nAfter 180 days the PLLA presents similar surface characteristics, suggesting that the enzymes from soil \n\nmicrobes had no significant effects on the degradation of the PLLA specimens. Moreover, it was clearly \n\nobserved for the PHBV/Cork the typical random shape morphology evidencing microbial activity and the \n\npresence of living organisms such as fungi. After 180 days both surfaces were colonized by hyphae as \n\nindicated (with arrows) in the PHBV/Cork of Figure 9.9. In polymers, the crystalline part is more difficult \n\nto degrade than the amorphous regions that have higher mobility of the polymeric chains and, therefore, \n\nare more accessible to the microorganisms. The presence of lignocellulosic particles distributed in the \n\npolymer matrix may act as channels and facilitate the microbial attack in natural cork semi-crystalline \n\nmatrix composites. Moreover, soil results as revealed in Figure 9.10, showed that cork presents high \n\nfungi resistance; however it is known that the structural components of cork (e.g. suberin, lignin and \n\ncellulose) also present in other plants can be degraded by specific enzymes or bacteria [31-34]. \n\nIn addition, several authors point the idea that lignocellulose-based fibres are the most widely used, as \n\nbiodegradable filler [21, 35, 36], indicating their potential to be used in biodegradable applications. \n\nSince both constituents are biodegradable, cork combined with bio-based matrices, also can potentially \n\norigin fully biodegradable composites. For example, the materials based on PCL and SPCL showed that \n\nthe biodegradation process is clear observed after 30 days. In the PCL and SPCL biocompsites after 60 \n\ndays, the cork particles are more visible. \n\nFor the SPCL/Cork these elements appear more exposed due to the selective loss of starch from the \n\nmatrix. After this period and for 180 days the disintegration and erosion of the specimens occurs due to \n\nthe high rate of biodegradation and not allowed the SEM observation. The decomposition sequence for \n\nthe biocomposites under soil can be described as follows. The biodegradable polymer at the specimen \n\nsurface first decomposes, followed by exposure of the internal cork granules stacked in the polymer \n\nmatrix. At the same time, the biodegradable polymer in cork-matrix interface decomposes, resulting in \n\nthe formation of interfacial gaps that increases with time exposing considerably more the cork particles. \n\nFinally, we suggest that substantial decomposition of the biodegradable polymer occurs and on cork \n\nstarts to occur. \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological \n\nand thermal properties \n\n \n\n297 \n\n9.3.4 Mechanical Properties  \n\n9.3.4.1 Control and water degradation tests \n\nThe tensile properties of the injection moulded biodegradable aliphatic polyesters and the \n\nbiocomposites before biodegradation essays are shown in Figure 9.11 a) for the tensile modulus and in \n\nFigure 9.11 b) for the maximum tensile strength. Table 9.3 indicates the values and standard deviations \n\nof the tensile properties including the maximum strain of the materials. Two distinct groups of materials \n\ncould be identified from these data. PLLA and PHBV present considerable higher stiffness and tensile \n\nstrength as compared with the PCL or SPCL specimens.  \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 9.11. Mechanical properties of the neat polymers and the biocomposite materials under tensile \n\nload.  \n\n \n\nIn opposite sides, PLLA has brittle properties, i.e. high strength and low maximum strain at break, while \n\nPCL reveals a ductile behaviour with low tensile modulus and higher strain at break. The addition of \n\ncork to PLLA and PHBV reduces the tensile modulus probably due to the higher elasticity of cork as \n\ncompared with the neat polyesters, contributing to some ductility. The effect of the elasticity of cork \n\nparticles was preferably observed in PHBV and its biocomposite were the reduction of stiffness it was \n\nfollowed by an increase of the strain at break. In general, the modulus of a composite material is also \n\nrelated with the density of the obtained material. This finding was also observed in the biocomposites, \n\nwhere the addition of 30 wt.% of cork increases the tensile modulus  of PCL matrix in 33% and \n\nmaintained the properties of the SPCL matrix as shown in Table 9.3. Moreover, cork promotes similar \n\neffect as the addition of starch to the PCL matrix. Regarding both PLLA and PHBV, the presence of cork \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological \n\nand thermal properties \n\n \n\n298 \n\nreduces the tensile modulus in 32%. Since cork is a foamed material, the modulus is much lower, that \n\nthe used bio-based polyesters: around 23.9 to 31.7 MPa depending of the direction [6, 7]. Concerning \n\nthe maximum tensile strength, the addition of cork promoted a reduction up to 50.1% for the PLLA; \n\n28.7% for the PHBV; 28.1% for the PCL and only 13.5% for the SPCL matrix. Based on the mechanical \n\nproperties of the control samples (matrices and its biocomposites), and in previous studies [12, 15, 16] \n\nusing polyolefins as matrices, we observed that the tensile strength on cork-polymer composites is \n\ndependent preferably on the type of the matrix and on the compatibility between matrix and cork and its \n\ncontent, whereas the tensile modulus is influenced by the cork content and processing characteristics. \n\n \n\nTable 9.3.

Moreover, the \n\nreduced strength of cork contributes to an inferior stress transfer between the cork-matrix and \n\nconsequent lower mechanical properties. \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological \n\nand thermal properties \n\n \n\n299 \n\nThe tensile properties along the water degradation tests are shown in Figure 9.12, where it was \n\nobserved in some cases a small reduction in the mechanical performance with time. Moreover, starch \n\nswells high water contents, so it was expected that both strength and stiffness tend to decline with the \n\ntime. However in almost all conditions this was not significant due to the high standard deviations of the \n\nspecimens indicating some variation on the materials surface as supported by the previous \n\nmorphological results.  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nFigure 9.12. Mechanical behaviour of the biocomposites under water during 60 days.  \n\n \n\nFurthermore, it was found for a period up to 14 days an increase in the tensile modulus for the \n\nmaterials containing starch. This occurred probably due to a plasticizing effect promoted by the water \n\nabsorbed by the starch and the presence of some plasticizers in the blend composition. Since the blend \n\nand its biocomposite were mechanically evaluated after drying we suggest the influence of sorption-\n\ndesorption mechanism effect. The drying process of the biocomposites may cause the drying of some \n\nresidual water-filled cellular lumia in cork that causes shrinkage, contributing to some minor variation \n\non the composite stiffness. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological \n\nand thermal properties \n\n \n\n300 \n\n9.3.4.2 Soil degradation tests \n\nThe loss of the mechanical properties of the injection moulded specimens was more pronounced under \n\nsoil conditions. The relationship between tensile strength and burial period under soil is shown in Figure \n\n9.13. According to the tensile modulus the bio-based materials gradually loses the mechanical \n\nproperties with the time. Even PLLA presented higher standard deviation in function of time essay that \n\nmay indicate some chemical degradation of the polyester structure.  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nFigure 9.13. Mechanical behaviour of the biocomposites under soil during 180 days.  \n\n \n\nThe mechanical properties were in agreement with the previous weight loss results and morphological \n\nobservations, being the materials most affected the PCL and SPCL based materials. It was also \n\nobserved after 14 days the increase in the tensile modulus for the SPCL materials around 20%. This \n\noccurred due to the high moisture content absorbed by the starch under soil conditions acting as \n\nplasticizer and by the presence of plasticizer in the SPCL blend composition. After the 14 days the drop \n\non the mechanical properties was quite noticeable, especially in terms of maximum strength. It was \n\npossible to monitoring the behavior of the SPCL/cork biocomposite up to 60 days, while the SPCL \n\nblend after the 30 days loses the specimen integrity to be tested under tensile load. Furthermore, the \n\nmechanical response of the developed materials it confirmed that granulated cork decreases the \n\nbiodegradation rate. This behaviour was also observed for the PCL matrix and its biocomposite as \n\nindicated in Figure 9.13 d), being evident the loss in the tensile strenght between 30 and 60 days, \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological \n\nand thermal properties \n\n \n\n301 \n\nwhere PCL starts to lose more properties due to biodegradation. This mechanical failure is consistent \n\nwith the higher porosity of PCL surface as compared with the PCL/Cork observed by SEM micrographs \n\nafter the 30 days of burial soil test, see Figure 9.10. \n\n9.3.5 Thermal analysis  \n\nThe influence of cork on the thermal stability of the injection moulded biocomposites and the stability of \n\nthe polyesters was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) essays. TGA results and the respective \n\nderivative thermogravimetric curves (DTG) are shown in Figure 9.14.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n \n\nFigure 9.14. Thermogravimetric curves of the neat polymers and the biocomposites. \n\n \n\nThe initial degradation temperature (Tonset), maximum peaks obtained in the DTG curve and the ash \n\ncontent are shown in Table 9.4. The thermal degradation process of PLLA, PHBV and its biocomposites \n\noccurs in only one weight loss step, while for the PCL, SPCL and its biocomposites a multi-step \n\ndegradation process was observed. In the presence of cork the curves are shifted to lower temperatures \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological \n\nand thermal properties \n\n \n\n302 \n\nindicating a small decreasing in thermal stability of biocomposite. The only exception was with PHBV, \n\nwhere the addition of cork improved the initial thermal stability. This small increase on the thermal \n\nstability occurred despite of cork presented the lower initial degradation temperature of 246.3\u00baC as \n\ncompared with the used polyester matrices (see Table 9.4). Some recent studies evidenced that the \n\naddition of nano-clay and natural fibres reduced or maintain, respectively, the thermal stability of PHBV \n\n[37, 38]. However in the present study cork promoted a slight and positive increase in 5.5% to the initial \n\ndegradation temperature. \n\n \n\nTable 9.4.

Comparing \n\nthe effect of cork and starch on the PCL matrix, Figure 9.14 c) shows that cork revealed higher thermal \n\nstability than starch. This result was also confirmed by the DTG curve of  \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological \n\nand thermal properties \n\n \n\n303 \n\n  \n\n  \n \n\nFigure 9.14.  d) with the intense peaks appearing at 318.4 \u00baC for SPCL and 323.6 \u00baC for PCL/Cork. \n\n \n\nThe TGA curves and the results of Table 9.4 indicated that thermal degradation of biocomposites is a \n\ncombined phenomenon of thermal degradation of each of the components; i.e., the selected matrix and \n\nthe granulated cork. The TGA findings also point that cork was the last material to be degraded \n\npromoting a slower thermal degradation to the biocomposites at higher temperatures resulting in a \n\nlower weight loss rate and higher ash content, from 6.3% up to 9.3%.  \n\nDifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) also provides relevant information about the thermal and \n\nstructural characteristics of materials. In this study, DSC was performed to understand the effect of the \n\ncork on the nucleation and crystallinity of the bio-based polyesters, using for that the second heating \n\nscan. Thus, we are erasing any previous thermal story through the first heating cycle. The onset values \n\nof phase transition temperatures (crystallization temperature Tc, cold crystallization temperature Tcc and \n\nmelting temperature Tm), glass transition temperature Tg  at the mid-point of heat capacity changes and \n\nenthalpies (?Hcc, cold crystallization enthalpy, ?Hm, melting enthalpy and ?Hc, crystallization enthalpy) \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological \n\nand thermal properties \n\n \n\n304 \n\nrecorded by DSC of the injection moulded materials are summarized in Table 9.5. The thermograms \n\nare shown in Figure 9.15.  \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 9.15. DSC termograms of the biobased composites with cork at 20 \u00baC min-1 showing: a) the \n\nsecond heating and b) the first cooling. \n\n \n\nIn this study, we observed that the PLLA, PHBV and the respective biocomposites (Figure 9.15 a) \n\ndisplayed on heating three main transitions: glass transition, a cold crystallization exothermic followed \n\nby a melting endothermic event. We also observed the influence of cork on the Tg of the PLLA and \n\nPHBV polyesters. It has been found that Tg was slightly affected by the composition, with a small \n\nincrease with the cork content, from 57.3 to 58.4 \u00baC and -0.6 to 4.6 \u00baC (see Table 9.5), suggesting \n\nconfinement of the mobile amorphous phase. This finding, previously observed in the PHB using a \n\ndifferent type of natural fibres [39], was explained by an intermolecular interaction between carbonyl (-\n\nC=O) groups of the PHBV and hydroxyl (-OH) groups of the natural fibre that decreases the molecular \n\nflexibility of the polymer chains involved in the glass transition. \n\nThe PLLA present an amorphous structure that might be related with the DSC cooling rate of 20 \n\n\u00baC/min that could prevent crystallization of the material. In the case of the PLLA thermogram, the cold \n\ncrystallization temperature peak was shifted to lower temperature with the addition of cork. This agrees \n\nwith the finds in the literature [40] that the presence of some lignocellulosic materials such as wood \n\ncan promote the initial cold crystallization temperature of the PLLA matrix. Moreover, the thermograms \n\nof the PLLA and PHBV show a single melting temperature peak event at 160.5 \u00baC and 170 \u00baC \n\nrespectively. \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological \n\nand thermal properties \n\n \n\n305 \n\n \n\nTable 9.5.

Moreover, for the biocomposites it was \n\nobserved a second melting peak with smaller intensity and lower temperature. In different \n\nlignocellulosic biocomposites, the presence of two melting peaks almost completely overlapped were \n\nattributed to the presence and reorganization of a different type of crystals with higher order degree and \n\nstability [41]. Cork interferes in the crystal morphology of PLLA and PHBV during the melting as a result \n\nthe nucleation growth of the bio-based polyester becomes more homogenised in presence of cork \n\nparticles. The onset temperature of the crystallisation during the cooling tends to show a slight but not \n\nsignificant increase with the cork content in the semi-crystalline PCL and SPCL. In the PLC the Tc was \n\nfound to occur at 29.6 \u00baC and for PLC/Cork at 29.1\u00baC, while the SPCL and SPCL/Cork showed it at \n\n27.5 and 28.1\u00baC, respectively. We observed that the heating of crystallization and the heating of \n\nmelting of the bio-based matrices in all the biocomposites increased with the addition of cork indicating \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological \n\nand thermal properties \n\n \n\n306 \n\nan improvement in the degree of crystallinity (?c) as shown in Table 9.5. These findings suggest that \n\ncork may have the ability to modify the crystallisation by increasing the number of nucleating sites in \n\nthe bio-based polyesters and enhancing its crystallinity degree. Moreover, the addition of starch to the \n\nPCL reduced the crystallinity in 5.8%, thus contributing to enhancing the biodegradation. \n\n9.4 Conclusions \n\nThis study dealt with the effect of water immersion and soil degradation on the weight changes, tensile \n\nand morphological  properties of biodegradable polyester biomposites containing granulated cork (30 \n\nwt.%) processed by extrusion followed by injection moulding. This environmental friendly approach of \n\nusing a renewable material such as natural cork, promoted a reduction of PLLA and PHBV density \n\nresulting in lightweight biocomposites. All materials revealed low water absorption, being the higher \n\nvalues correspond to the biocomposites containing cork and preferably in the presence of the starch. \n\nThermal properties by DSC have confirmed the positive effect on the use of cork that increases the \n\ncrystallinity degree for all the used bio-based polyester matrices. Biodegradation of the specimens under \n\nburial soil during 6 months was significantly more severe than under static water conditions, as \n\nmonitored from the loss of tensile modulus and maximum strength. As expected the use of starch \n\naccelerates the biodegradation rate also confirmed by morphological observation. Moreover, this study \n\nallowed comparing the contribution of cork and starch to the PCL polymer (i.e. SPCL and PCL/Cork). \n\nCork contributes with higher hydrolytic and dimensional stability than starch. Both materials improved \n\nconsiderably the stiffness; however cork induces weight reduction and is less sensitive to moisture. TGA \n\nshowed that cork presents higher thermal stability than starch. Regarding the degree of crystallinity, the \n\nDSC analysis revealed an opposite effect for both fillers were starch contributed to an increase of the \n\namorphous phase supporting the higher biodegradation. This findings could demonstrate the benefits of \n\ncombine cork with bio-based matrices that can origin fully biodegradable eco-friendly composites. \n\nBesides the cost reduction of bio-based matrices by adding cork, it is possible to provide aesthetic \n\ncharacteristics, or reduce matrix weight or even increase stiffness depending of the used biodegradable \n\npolymer. Cork biocomposites are good candidates for the production of sustainable products promoting \n\nadded-value to cork biomass for a wide range of applications. \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological \n\nand thermal properties \n\n \n\n307 \n\n9.5 References \n\n[1] John MJ, Thomas S.

General conclusions and future perspectives \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 General conclusions and future perspectives \n\n \n\n313 \n\n General conclusions and future perspectives \n\nThe investment in academic research and innovation, in Portugal, is far from being exploited by national \n\ncompanies, as a tool for sustainable growth. This thesis is part of the result of a straightforward \n\ncollaboration with the industry to develop knowledge and new applications based on cork-polymer \n\ncomposite (CPC) materials. The main objectives of this thesis were:  \n\n \n\n? to combine the engineering properties of the commodity thermoplastic matrices with the unique \n\nproperties of cork trough melt based technologies and to create cork-based composites; \n\n? to promote an added-value to different cork by-products obtained from finishing industrial \n\noperations and from end life products,  \n\n? to get the knowledge of compounding the lignocellulosic materials (i.e. cork and/or natural \n\nfibres) with thermoplastics, allowing high volumes of cork in the final material;  \n\n? to reinforce the developed cork-polymer composites (CPC) using the potential of coupling \n\nagents based on maleic anhydride with good distribution and dispersion of the particles in the \n\npolymer matrix; \n\n? to isolate the major chemical components of cork powder (i.e. suberin and lignin) and use them \n\nas a coupling agent to promote the interfacial adhesion;  \n\n? to improve the mechanical response of CPC using natural fibres, creating novel hybrid \n\ncomposite systems; \n\n? to engineering a class of cork biocomposites more sustainable with acceptable in-service \n\nperformance and tendency for rapid out-of-service biodegradation. \n\n \n\nFigure 10.1 shows an overall view of the integrating work performed with the CPC materials and their \n\npotential applications. The general conclusions of the research work produced in the present thesis, \n\nwhich extends from Chapter 3 to 9, are summarized as follows: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 General conclusions and future perspectives \n\n314 \n\n \n\nFigure 10.1. Global scheme of the work developed on cork-polymer composites (CPC) and potential \n\nareas of application. \n\n \n\nChapter 3 creates a viable and profitable alternative to storage or burn of cork by-products, such as \n\npowders from grinding, sanding, external industrial operations and from corkstyle or floating products. \n\nThe moisture content of these by-products ranged from 5.4 up to 18.0%, being the lower values of \n\nmoisture referents to the cork sanding/external powder. The moisture content on the natural \n\ncomponent is an important issue during the compounding process. In this sense, a correct dry and \n\nstabilization of these components is fundamental, in order to avoid reduction of properties on the final \n\nproduct.  \n\nIn this study, different classes of cork powders were combined with high-density polyethylene, recycled \n\npolymer and polypropylene by pultrusion to created CPC pellets of cork-polymer (50-50 wt.%) followed \n\nby compression moulding to produce boards. The reduced density of the cork-based composite pellets, \n\nshows the potential of the pultrusion technology to develop pultruded products taking the advantages of \n\nthe cork low density.  \n\nThermal analysis by DSC of the crystallization process, revealed the nucleating ability of cork, promoting \n\nan increase on the composite crystalinity. Microscopic optical observation confirmed a preferential \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 General conclusions and future perspectives \n\n \n\n315 \n\nincreasing of the spherulites around the cork particle in the thermoplastic matrix. Contrary to other \n\nlignocellulosic materials such as natural fibres, cork did not present evidence of the transcrystallinity \n\nphenomena.  \n\nThe mechanical performance showed that, in a number of properties polypropylene is superior \n\ncompared to polyethylene, since it is lighter, stronger and stiffer. The use of cork powder in 50 wt.% \n\nreduces the mechanical properties of the polyolefin matrix. The use of polyolefins as matrices in the \n\nproduction of lignocellulosic composites can be limited by the lower affinity between the components. \n\nThe addition of 2 wt.% of functionalized polymers containing maleic anhydride (MA) groups during \n\ncompounding (i.e.PE-g-MA or PP-g-MA) showed to be an effective method to improve interfacial bonding, \n\neven when using different cork qualities. The tensile properties of the different CPC were considerably \n\nenhanced in terms of tensile modulus and tensile strength.  \n\nThe work shows that the use of recycled polymers combined with cork by-products from the cork \n\nindustrial process revealed to be an interesting approach that contributes to higher sustainable products. \n\nHowever, the diminishing of the mechanical properties must be considered for the envisaged \n\napplication.  \n\nCPC produced by pultrusion clearly show that cork powders and polyolefin\u2019s can be successfully used \n\nto produce CPC with high cork content. In order to obtain cork based composite materials with \n\nenhanced mechanical properties, reinforcement strategies must be taken in consideration. \n\nAnother possibility to be explored the cork by-products, is to produce CPC on a flat-press like the \n\ntraditional wood-based panels. The advantage of this technology is that only a relatively low pressure \n\nlevel is required as compared to the extrusion and injection moulding. \n\n \n\nAlong with the previous Chapter 3, the work of Chapter 4 potentiates the use of cork-polymer composite \n\nmaterials for building applications such as underlay material in flooring systems and we compared their \n\ncharacteristics with the well-established high-density fibreboard (HDF) and medium-density fibreboards \n\n(MDF) materials. On HDF and preferentially on MDF, moisture problem arises due to wood being a \n\nnaturally hygroscopic material. In service these products can be exposed to a range of environmental \n\nconditions. The relationship between moisture content and strength properties is very important, if \n\npanel products are to be used as structural materials subjected to atmospheric moisture conditions as \n\nis the case of flooring systems. The CPC obtained by pultrusion followed by compression moulding can \n\ntake advantage, since they show much lower water absorption and lower thickness swelling variation. \n\nThey are also free from formaldehyde emission when compared to the HDF and MDF.  \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 General conclusions and future perspectives \n\n316 \n\nThe morphological studies of cork based composites showed good dispersion and distribution or the \n\ncork along the matrix. Thus, the cork based composites presented reduced warping characteristics \n\nindicating good dimensional stability. Regarding the fibreboards, the fibrous morphology explains the \n\nsuperior mechanical properties obtained as compared with the CPC (50-50) wt.%. The addition of \n\n50wt.% of cork improves the flexural modulus of the thermoplastic matrix, while considerably reduces \n\nthe flexural strength.  \n\nThe cork fraction represents around 86% in volume of the composite material. This fact supports the \n\nCPC good acoustic behaviour when compared with the commercial fibre boards. The CPC materials \n\npresent similar acoustic performance to the fibreboards, however at high frequencies the behaviour of \n\nthe CPC is superior, probably due to the cellular structure of cork.  \n\nCork presents the advantage to act as fire retardant in the polyolefins. According to the fire resistance \n\ntests and to the stands, the developed cork based composites presents the same \u201cfire class\u201d as \n\ncompared with the HDF and MDF. Thus, CPC materials proved to be good candidates to be used as \n\nunderlay materials on floor applications. More information related with the CPC process is provided in \n\nthe Appendix 1 (patent WO2009072914 (A1)) of this thesis. Figure 10.2 shows a prototype of a \n\nlaminated flooring system using CPC (50-50) wt.% as underlay. \n\n \n\nFigure 10.2. Prototype of a laminated flooring system using CPC as underlay. \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 General conclusions and future perspectives \n\n \n\n317 \n\n \n\nFurther work on the optimization of the compression moulding conditions of the CPC using a design of \n\nexperiments (DOE) can be used to obtain the correct temperature, applied pressure and amount of \n\ncoupling agent that are the principal parameters to optimize in order to obtain the appropriated \n\nmechanical response for the selected application. Furthermore, finishing operations in the prototypes, \n\nsuch as machining, lamination, cutting or gluing the CPC with other layer should be addressed.  \n\n \n\nAs compared with other lignocellulosic composites, the final properties of the CPC are highly dependent \n\non the processing conditions. Thus, the final specifications of a CPC material can be tailored for a \n\nspecific application by varying the compounding process, amount and cork particle size, chemical or \n\nsurface treatment and type and amount of coupling agent.  \n\nIn Chapter 5, it was studied the polypropylene-cork (PP/cork) composites produced using co-rotating \n\ntwin-screw extruder followed by injection or compression moulding process.  During the extrusion \n\nprocess it was avoided an aggressive mixing configuration in the screw profile with several mixing zones, \n\nsince this fact may increase the density of the cork particles during the compounding.  \n\nThe effect of cork on the melt viscosity of the polypropylene was accessed by melt flow index (MFI). The \n\naddition of cork to the thermoplastic reduces considerably the viscosity and consequently the MFI. The \n\naddition of the coupling agent PP-g-MA to the composite promotes an opposite effect and improves the \n\nmixability.  \n\nThe injection moulded PP/Cork composites exhibit low water uptake and the increase of cork fraction, \n\nincreases the water absorption up to 2.3 wt.% after a period of 1344 hours. It seems that the \n\nhydrophobic nature of cork may take some advantage over other natural fibre materials such as wood. \n\nIt was possible to reduce the water uptake by: (a) increasing the particle size of the cork and (b) by the \n\naddition of coupling agent that significantly reduces the water absorption of the CPC.  \n\nThe morphology evaluated by optical microscopy revealed good dispersion and distribution of cork and \n\na high good cohesion between cork and the polyolefin, even in the absence of coupling agent. No voids \n\nwere observed in the different conditions. \n\nThe composites density is higher than the neat polypropylene and increases with the higher \n\nincorporation of cork. The use of coupling agent induces a slight decrease on the density due to a better \n\ndispersion of the cork along the matrix. \n\nThe mechanical properties under tensile load shows a small reinforcement of around 10% in the \n\nstiffness provided by incorporating cork at a 5 wt.%. For higher cork content (i.e. up to 30wt.%) the \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 General conclusions and future perspectives \n\n318 \n\ntensile properties are reduced. The ability to transfer the stress from the thermoplastic matrix to the \n\ncork or reinforcement will depend essentially of the cork-polymer interactions that can be reduced due \n\nto the incompatibility between lignocellulosic materials and polymeric matrix. To overcome these \n\nlimitations it is necessary to promote polymer modification, with the use of polar functional groups, \n\nsuch as maleic anhydride. The mechanical properties were enhanced by the addition of polypropylene \n\ngraft maleic anhydride (PP-g-MA) in terms of tensile strength and maximum strain. A good balance of \n\nthe mechanical properties was achieved by using 2 wt.% upt to 4 wt.% of coupling agent. The use of the \n\nstearic acid in 2 wt.% does not modify significantly the tensile properties, however a slight increase on \n\nthe maximum strain was noticed. The stearic acid acts as plasticizer in the cork-polymer system. \n\nOne of the main concerns on the use of lignocellulosic in composites is their susceptibility to moisture \n\nabsorption and the consequent effect on the physical and mechanical properties. The tensile properties \n\nof PP/cork composites were compared before and after water immersion tests and revealed to be very \n\nsimilar, which is a clear advantage of the CPC materials. \n\nThe use of DSC on the thermal properties of the PP/Cork composites revealed higher crystallization \n\ntemperatures than neat PP, and their thermal stability was similar to that of PP. The results are \n\naccording to the achieved in the cork composites obtained by pultrusion, where in this study cork and \n\nPP-g-MA acted as nucleating agents during the crystallization process. Cork promoted a small increase \n\non the composite crystallinity up to 30 wt.%, however the enhancement was also dependent on the \n\ndegree of compatibility between the PP and the cork. \n\nPolypropylene is more susceptible to oxidation when compared with polyethylene due to its chemical \n\nstructure, requiring higher amounts of antioxidants and stabilizers. Thermal analysis by DSC at 200\u00baC \n\nrevealed that the addition of cork promotes an antioxidant effect to the polypropylene increasing the \n\ntime to oxidation. Reducing the cork particle size and consequently increasing the surface area of the \n\nparticles contributes to a higher thermal-oxidative protection. By using 30 wt.% of cork powder the \n\noxidation was delayed almost 13 times as compared with the neat PP. \n\nCork is well known to be a good thermal and acoustic insulator material. Unexpectedly, the thermal \n\nconductivity of the PP/cork composites increases with the increase of the cork weight fraction. This \n\neffect is related with the high pressures applied in the melt based processes increasing the density of \n\nthe final cork composite and consequently reducing the thermal resistance. The higher capacity for heat \n\ntransfer on the developed cork composites may result in new potential applications in electric and \n\nelectronic cover systems. \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 General conclusions and future perspectives \n\n \n\n319 \n\nThe maximum incorporation of cork on the polypropylene matrix was 70 wt.% that represents 93% in \n\nvolume of the cork based composite. This was achieved using cork powder compounded in a counter-\n\nrotating twin-screw extruder without die.  \n\nFigure 10.3 shows the potential to obtain 3D cork-based composite structures obtained by the injection \n\nmoulding process, where cork cannot compete alone. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10.3. CPC materials (50-50) wt.% obtained by injection moulding. \n\n \n\nAs future work, a better understanding of the rheological behaviour of the developed CPC should be \n\naddressed to improve the compounding process. The production of cork-polymer composites materials \n\nin a single melt based technology step such as extrusion of a profile must be considered to obtain the \n\nfinal product. In the development of cork-based composite flooring application, the incorporation of \n\nsubstances with the capability to promote electromechanical properties, motion sensors embedded in \n\nthe composite, or the improvement of conductivity for heating flooring systems will be of high relevance. \n\nThe developed cork composites may include furniture, flooring and insulation systems, hardware for \n\nelectronics, outdoor systems, among other sustainable applications. \n\n \n\nThe need to improve the interface between cork-polymer was previously achieved by the use of coupling \n\nagent and it is well known that compatibility between lignocellulosic materials and the polymer matrix \n\nplays an important role in determining the properties of a composite. Lignocellulosic materials such as \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 General conclusions and future perspectives \n\n320 \n\ncork, which have polar hydroxyl groups on the surface, have difficulty to create bonded interfaces with a \n\nnonpolar polymer matrix such as polyethylene and polypropylene, limiting their use.  \n\nIn Chapter 6, the used methods from the literature allowed isolating the major fractions from cork (i.e. \n\nsuberin and lignin) that were confirmed by chemical FTIR analysis. However, it is also known that the \n\nstructure of the major components of cork has not been fully established.  \n\nTGA analysis confirmed that suberin and lignin fractions, isolated from cork, present sufficient thermal \n\nstability to be applied in melt based technologies such as extrusion processes.  \n\nThe research methodology of using a reactive extrusion (REX) process as a reactor, allowed using \n\nsuberin and lignin as environmentally friendly coupling agents to improve interfacial adhesion of cork-\n\npolymer system. REX has the capability of functionalizing, preparing the composite and producing CPC \n\npellets in a single step. \n\nThe mechanical tensile tests indicate that the suberin and lignin can be used as bio-based coupling \n\nagents in the presence of benzoyl peroxide (BPO) to produce functionalized CPC with superior \n\nmechanical properties. Suberin acts as a plasticizer, improving the cork dispersion and reduces the \n\ncomposite\u00b4s stiffness, providing additional flexibility and formability to the composite. Lignin shows to \n\nact as a coupling agent and the use of 2wt% of lignin improved both maximum tensile strength and \n\nmodulus in 48% and 39% respectively. Increasing the amount of lignin to 4 wt.% reduces the \n\nmechanical performance of the composites. The use of 2wt% of PE-g-MA increases 34% the maximum \n\nstrength, 30% the tensile modulus and reduces the maximum strain. Coupling agents in CPCs play a \n\nvery important role in improving compatibility and adhesion between the polar cork material and the \n\nnon-polar polymer matrices. \n\nAll the developed functionalized CPC present low water uptake and thickness swelling variation, \n\ndisplaying similar behavior as compared with coupling agents based on maleic anhydride.  \n\nThermal properties by TGA and DSC reveal that lignin can act as a thermal protective agent and suberin \n\nact as an antioxidant agent on the composites, while the PE-g-MA act as both.  \n\nFurther work should be conducted to deeper understanding this complex system and which of the \n\nchemical groups are responsible to contribute to this enhancement on the mechanical properties.  \n\n \n\nThe research methodology present in Chapter 7 and Chapter 8, allowed the production of hybrid cork \n\nbased composite materials reinforced with short natural fibres (i.e. coconut and sisal fibre). In both \n\nchapters, hybrid cork based composites using high density polyethylene as matrix were obtained by \n\ntwin-screw extrusion followed by compression moulding and presented a cork ratio of 40 wt.% up to 50 \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 General conclusions and future perspectives \n\n \n\n321 \n\nwt.%. This reinforcement strategy shows that the lignocellulosic\u2013matrix interaction was improved either \n\nvia the use of natural fiber, or by modifying the fibre surface, or via the matrix, by employing coupling \n\nagents resulting in composites with considerably higher mechanical properties. \n\nThe physical modification of the sisal fibres by using alkali treatment (or mercerization) was confirmed \n\nby FTIR, showing potential to dissolve some lignin and wax from the fibre surface promoting a cleaner \n\nfibre surface to interact with the matrix.   \n\nXRD results reflect the influence of the alkali treatment and show a small increase on the crystallinity, \n\nconfirming the surface modification of the sisal fibres.  \n\nIn terms of uniaxial tensile strength the mean values of maximum strength of the unmodified sisal is \n\nhigher compared with the modified fibres. This may be related with the alkali chemical treatment that \n\npromoted the reduction of the fibre thickness and some removing of the hemicelluloses and lignin. \n\nThe fracture morphology of the hybrid cork based composites reinforced with the short natural fibres by \n\nSEM was in accordance with the mechanical results, showing the improved effect of fibre-matrix \n\nadhesion in the presence of coupling agent. \n\nThe improvement on the mechanical properties under tensile load of the hybrid composites with \n\ncoconut and sisal was effective in the presence of coupling agent based on maleic anhydride (MA), \n\nrevealing higher stiffness, strength and elongation at break. \n\nThe flexural properties using alkali treated sisal fibres with coupling agent presents an increase of 33% \n\nin flexural modulus and an increase of 98% in the strength when compared with unreinforced cork \n\ncomposites. This alkali treatment leads to higher mechanical properties of the composites since \n\ncellulose has higher mechanical properties compared to lignin and also increases specific surface area \n\nleading to better interaction with the matrix. \n\nComparing the properties of the hybrid CPC with the polyethylene matrix, it was shown that a \n\nreinforcement of the matrix in terms of stiffness and strength at flexural load is achieved mainly after \n\nthe sisal fibres alkali treatment. In terms of tensile strength, they present similar stiffness and lower \n\nstrength when compared to the polyethylene matrix. Higher mechanical properties where obtain using \n\nwood fibre with coupling agent based on maleic anhydride and the additional results related with this \n\ninvention are provided in the Appendix (patent WO2011014085 (A3)) of this thesis. \n\nThe low values of coefficient of variation of the mechanical properties of the hybrid CPC solutions, \n\nsupports the homogeneous properties in terms of cork and fibre distribution on the composites. \n\nThe Ashby diagram allowed to identify the best developed CPC composite formulation and to visualize \n\nthe improvement over the CPC without fibre reinforcement. \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 General conclusions and future perspectives \n\n322 \n\nWeibull diagram was used to reliably identify the composites safety limits. The tensile strength of the \n\nhybrid reinforced CPC was found to be in agreement with the Weibull cumulative distribution, which can \n\nbe used to accurately predict the mechanical properties of the CPC composites. \n\nThis reinforcement strategy shows the potential to obtain CPC with superior mechanical performance. \n\nThis knowledge can be applied in the flooring system to reinforce complex geometries or to improve \n\nresistance, to machining or to apply the CPC as structural materials. \n\nFurthermore, different natural fibres should be tested and the cork surface modification attempted to \n\npromote cork-matrix compatibility. A deeper understanding of the complex nature of cork and natural \n\nfibers and their surface properties is still needed in order to optimize natural fiber surface modification \n\nprocesses. Using materials like natural based composites that reduce construction waste and increase \n\nenergy efficiency would provide a solution to immediate infrastructure needs while promoting the \n\nconcept of sustainability. \n\n \n\nChapter 9 shows injection moulded biocomposites combining different biodegradable aliphatic \n\npolyesters (i.e. PLLA, PHBV, PCL and SPCL) with cork 30 wt.%. Cork combined with bio-based matrices \n\ncan originate fully biodegradable composites for sustainable applications. The cork biocomposites were \n\nengineered to satisfy acceptable stiffness, strength, and in-service durability while maintaining the \n\ntendency for rapid out-of-service biodegradation. A possible application is shown in Figure 10.4 as \n\nbiodegradable caps for wine bottles. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10.4. Cork biocomposites as cap for wine bottles: a) Prototype of the cap solution and CPC \n\npellets and b) polystyrene (PS) cap and developed biodegradable solutions with cork. \n\nThe lower density obtained in the biocomposites is one potential advantage to create lightweight \n\nsustainable materials in the automotive area with improved insulation properties. \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 General conclusions and future perspectives \n\n \n\n323 \n\n \n\nThe injection moulded materials revealed low water absorption, being the higher values corresponding \n\nto the biocomposites containing cork and preferably in the presence of the starch. \n\nCork combined with PLLA and PHBV presents adequate mechanical properties, high dimensional \n\nstability under water and reduced density resulting in lightweight biocomposites.  \n\nSEM micrographs show that biodegradation was found to occur primarily at the polymer surface and \n\nwas more pronounced for the materials under burial soil. \n\nBiodegradation of the specimens under burial soil was significantly more severe than under static water \n\nwith the loss of tensile modulus and maximum strength. After 6 months, the biodegradation of the \n\nbiocomposites decreased in the following order: SPCL/Cork > SPCL > PCL > PCL/Cork > PHBV/Cork > \n\nPHBV > PLLA/Cork and PLLA. During soil burial tests, PCL, SPCL and its biocomposites revealed a \n\nsustained weight loss and diminishing on the mechanical properties in terms of tensile modulus and \n\nmaximum strength with the time. On contrary, the durability of some biocomposites such as PLLA/Cork \n\nand PHBV/Cork, that shows lower rate of degradation, results in products that require less \n\nmaintenance and a much longer life. \n\nThe thermal characterization by DSC has evidenced that the presence of cork increases the crystallinity \n\ndegree for all the used bio-based polyester matrices. The presence of starch decreases considerably the \n\nbiocomposite crystallinity contributing to an increase of the amorphous phase supporting the higher \n\nbiodegradation rate. The melting temperature of the cork biocomposites is higher as compared with the \n\naliphatic polyesters due to the thermal resistance of cork material. This behaviour should be taken into \n\naccount during the melt based process.   \n\nTGA analysis confirmed that the biocomposites presented a multi-degradation process, where cork only \n\nwas able to improve the thermal stability for the PHBV matrix. In the other polyester matrices the \n\npresence of cork reduces the initial degradation temperature, being the lower value of 266.9\u00baC for the \n\nPCL/Cork biocomposite. Moreover, it was confirmed that cork starts to degrade at 246.3\u00baC, however it \n\ncontributes to a slower degradation rate of the biocomposites higher temperatures. TGA showed that \n\ncork presents higher thermal stability than starch. \n\nThe results show the benefits of combining cork with bio-based matrices that can originate fully \n\nbiodegradable eco-friendly composites. Besides the cost reduction of bio-based matrices by adding cork, \n\nit was possible to increase the composite stiffness depending of the used biodegradable polymer, \n\nreduce the matrix weight and improve aesthetic characteristics. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 General conclusions and future perspectives \n\n324 \n\nFuture work on innovative technologies and process solutions should be intensively researched to get \n\nthe high strength engineering composites which are related to their new applications area. Strategies to \n\nreduce composite density, such as (i) the use of cork and (ii) the use of foaming agents in the matrix, \n\nwithout considerable loss on the mechanical performance, must be considered. Based on the literature \n\nreview of this thesis, there is a great potential on nano structures obtained from lignocellulosic materials \n\nthat present potential to reinforce these biocomposites, potentiating a new class of cork \n\nbionanocomposite materials. \n\n \n\nAs a final remark, we can say that this thesis allowed developing different classes of cork-polymer \n\ncomposite pellets for different areas of application. In areas where environmental concern, aesthetics, \n\nreduced plastic touch and construction capability are required, the composites containing forest based \n\nmaterials such as cork constitute a viable and interesting possibility. Regarding these properties, the \n\napplications for the developed cork composites may include furniture, flooring and insulation systems, \n\nhardware for electronics, toys for children, outdoor systems, automotive interior applications, among \n\nother sustainable applications. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n325 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAPPENDIXES \n\n \n\nAppendix 1.
