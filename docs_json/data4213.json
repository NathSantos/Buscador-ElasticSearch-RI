Under such conditions, the \n\npipelines tend to expand, but, if the expansion is inhibited, a significant compressive axial force \n\ncan arise, leading to their buckling, which can occur in the horizontal or vertical plane. In this \n\ncontext, the objective of the present work is to analyze the upheaval buckling of pipelines, \n\nconsidering the internal pressure to which they are subjected during the transportation of oil \n\nand gas as its only triggering. Using the concept of effective axial force, it aims at discussing \n\ntwo different approaches for considering the internal pressure in buckling problems: distributed \n\nloads dependent on pipeline curvature and equivalent compressive axial forces with follower \n\nand non-follower characteristics. It also discusses the influence of using static or dynamic \n\nanalysis for such approaches. Concerning the upheaval buckling itself, the work intends to \n\nanalyze and compare the influence of the soil imperfection amplitudes to the influence of the \n\nfriction between the pipeline and the ground in the critical loads and in the post-buckling \n\nconfigurations of the pipeline. Besides theoretical research, the objectives are achieved through \n\nthe development of various numerical models, since geometrically-simple models, without the \n\nconsideration of the interaction between the pipeline and the ground, until more complex \n\nmodels, with the use of contact models to detect the ground and its imperfections. The models \n\nare developed in Giraffe (Generic Interface Readily Accessible for Finite Elements) using \n\ngeometrically-exact finite element models of beams, undergoing large displacements and finite \n\nrotations. Through the research, it is concluded that there is an equivalence between the \n\napplication of the internal pressure as a distributed load dependent on pipeline curvature and \n\nthe application of the internal pressure as a follower compressive axial force. Besides this, it is \n\ndemonstrated that the type of the analysis (static or dynamic) depends on the nature of the \n\nphysical system analyzed. With the aid of results presented in terms of internal pressure, \n\nclassical results about the influence of the imperfection amplitudes and of the friction between \n\nthe pipeline and the ground in buckling are confirmed. It is also showed that the imperfection \n\namplitudes analyzed play a more important role in the post-buckling configurations of the \n\npipeline than the friction. \n\nKeywords:  Buckling.

Sob \n\ntais condi\u00e7\u00f5es, os dutos tendem a se expandir, por\u00e9m, se a expans\u00e3o \u00e9 inibida, uma for\u00e7a axial \n\nde compress\u00e3o significativa pode surgir nos dutos, ocasionando a flambagem lateral ou vertical \n\ndos mesmos. Dentro desse contexto, o objetivo do presente trabalho \u00e9 analisar a flambagem \n\nvertical de dutos, considerando a press\u00e3o interna \u00e0 qual eles est\u00e3o submetidos durante o \n\ntransporte de petr\u00f3leo e g\u00e1s natural como o \u00fanico par\u00e2metro desencadeador da flambagem. \n\nUsando o conceito de for\u00e7a axial efetiva, o trabalho objetiva discutir duas abordagens diferentes \n\npara considerar a press\u00e3o interna nos problemas de flambagem: carregamentos distribu\u00eddos \n\ndependentes da curvatura do duto e for\u00e7as axiais de compress\u00e3o equivalentes \u00e0 press\u00e3o com \n\ncar\u00e1ter seguidor e n\u00e3o seguidor. O trabalho tamb\u00e9m discute a influ\u00eancia de usar a an\u00e1lise \n\nest\u00e1tica ou din\u00e2mica para analisar essas abordagens de carregamento. Com rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 flambagem \n\nvertical propriamente dita, o trabalho pretende analisar e comparar a influ\u00eancia das amplitudes \n\ndas imperfei\u00e7\u00f5es presentes no solo com a influ\u00eancia do atrito entre o duto e o solo nas cargas \n\ncr\u00edticas e nas configura\u00e7\u00e3o p\u00f3s-cr\u00edticas do duto. Al\u00e9m de pesquisa te\u00f3rica, os objetivos s\u00e3o \n\natingidos atrav\u00e9s do desenvolvimento de v\u00e1rios modelos num\u00e9ricos, desde modelos \n\ngeometricamente simples, sem a considera\u00e7\u00e3o da intera\u00e7\u00e3o entre o duto e o solo, at\u00e9 modelos \n\nmais complexos, com o uso de modelos de contato para detectar o solo e suas imperfei\u00e7\u00f5es. Os \n\nmodelos s\u00e3o desenvolvidos no Giraffe (Generic Interface Readily Accessible for Finite \n\nElements) usando elementos finitos geometricamente exatos de viga, sujeitos a grandes \n\ndeslocamentos e rota\u00e7\u00f5es finitas. Atrav\u00e9s da pesquisa, conclui-se que existe uma equival\u00eancia \n\nentre a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o da press\u00e3o interna como um carregamento distribu\u00eddo dependente da curvatura \n\ndo duto e a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o da press\u00e3o interna como uma for\u00e7a axial de compress\u00e3o seguidora. Al\u00e9m \n\ndisso, demonstra-se que o tipo de an\u00e1lise (est\u00e1tica e din\u00e2mica) depende da natureza do sistema \n\nf\u00edsico analisado. Com a ajuda de resultados apresentados em termos de press\u00e3o interna, os \n\nresultados cl\u00e1ssicos sobre a influ\u00eancia das amplitudes das imperfei\u00e7\u00f5es e do atrito entre o duto \n\ne o solo s\u00e3o confirmados. Tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 mostrado que as amplitudes das imperfei\u00e7\u00f5es analisadas \n\ndesempenham uma maior influ\u00eancia nas configura\u00e7\u00f5es p\u00f3s-cr\u00edticas do duto do que o atrito. \n\nPalavras-chave: An\u00e1lise n\u00e3o linear.

\n\n \n\nThe production of oil and gas has increased in Brazil in the recent years. \n\nAccording to data from National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels1 (2015), the \n\nproduction of oil increased from 1.65 million barrels per day in 2005 to 2.30 million barrels per \n\nday in 2014 and the production of natural gas increased from 17.10 billion cubic meters per \n\nyear in 2005 to 31.90 billion cubic meters per year in 2014. Despite the high production values, \n\nthe amount of existing proved reservoirs is even larger: at the end of 2014 there were 16.20 \n\nbillion barrels of oil and 471.10 billion cubic meters of natural gas. Most of such reservoirs, \n\nabout 95% and 85%, respectively, are in the sea and many of them in deep waters, such as the \n\npre-salt reservoirs. These conditions require constant development of new technologies of oil \n\nand gas exploitation by industry. \n\nIn the productive chain of oil and gas, providing from onshore and offshore \n\nfields, once performed the extraction, it is necessary to transport the fluid to the distribution and \n\nrefining sites. Such transportation is made predominantly by pipelines. For example, \n\nspecifically in the case of subsea pipelines, according to Bai and Bai (2014), the term of subsea \n\nflowlines is used to describe subsea pipelines that transport oil and gas from the wellhead to the \n\nriser base. The riser, in its turn, is connected to the processing facilities. Finally, the \n\ntransportation from there to shore is performed by export pipelines.  \n\nSince the oil and gas fields have high pressure and high temperature (HPHT), \n\nthe fluids usually leave the reservoirs still keeping such thermodynamic state during the \n\ntransportation. If it changes, wax and hydrate may be formed as the fluid cools along the \n\npipeline, which is not desired. Therefore, in order to make the transportation more efficient, it \n\nis necessary that the pipelines operate at high pressure and temperature conditions. These \n\nconditions are becoming more and more severe since the oil and gas industries are advancing \n\nand discovering new reservoirs, especially in deep water regions. According to Bai and Bai \n\n(2014), there are three different levels of HPHT operation. The first level corresponds to \n\nreservoirs that have pressures up to 103 MPa and temperatures up to 177 oC. The second level, \n\nin its turn, is defined as \u201cextreme\u201d operations with pressures up to 138 MPa and temperatures \n\nup to 204 oC. Finally, the third level corresponds to \u201cultra\u201d operations with pressures up to 207 \n\nMPa and temperatures up to 260 oC. In Brazil, the pipelines operated by Transpetro (2017), for \n\nexample, are subjected to pressures not larger than 20 MPa. So, their operation can be included \n\n                                                 \n1 Ag\u00eancia Nacional do Petr\u00f3leo, G\u00e1s Natural e Biocombust\u00edveis \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\nin the first level described by Bai and Bai (2014). \n\nAmong other implications of HPHT operation in pipelines, the tendency of \n\nlongitudinal expansion can be cited. In practice, the expansion movement can be restricted, both \n\nby constraints at the pipeline ends and by the soil-pipeline interaction, generating a compressive \n\naxial force that, combined, for example, with the soil imperfections and the laying deviations, \n\ncan cause the buckling of the pipeline. When the compressive axial force reaches a certain \n\ncritical level of magnitude, the pipeline can experience two types of buckling: upheaval \n\nbuckling and lateral buckling (Figure 1). The first type, which, as its name suggests, occurs in \n\nthe vertical plane, is more common in buried pipelines and the second type, which occurs in the \n\nhorizontal plane, is more common in exposed pipelines, since the lateral resistance in the first \n\ntype is larger than in the second type. \n\n \n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Global buckling of pipelines. \n\n  \n\n(a) upheaval buckling (b) lateral buckling \n\nSource: (a) Nordnes (2015) and (b) E&amp;P Magazine (2015). \n\n \n\nThe aforementioned two types of buckling consist in global phenomena and, by \n\nthemselves, do not correspond to failure modes, but only to load responses. However, according \n\nto the recommended practice DNV-RP-F110 of Det Norske Veritas (2007), the buckling of \n\npipelines can propitiate, due to excessive bending, the occurrence of failures like local buckling, \n\nfracture and fatigue. The local buckling occurs due to the combination of longitudinal forces, \n\npressure and bending. It can occur by yielding of the cross section or buckling on the \n\ncompressive side of the pipe. The fracture is caused by excessive tensile strains and can include \n\nbrittle fracture and plastic collapse. Finally, fatigue can occur due to cyclic loads such as vortex \n\ninduced vibration (VIV), pressures, thermal and hydrodynamic loads (FAN, 2013). Such failure \n\nmodes may cause serious accidents since the fluid that is transported may leak and contaminate \n\nthe environment. In 2000, for example, in Guanabara Bay, Brazil, the lateral buckling caused \n\nlocal buckling and fracture of the wall of the Petrobras\u2019 pipeline PE-II, leaking 1300 cubic \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nmeters of oil. This accident, illustrated in Figure 2, occurred due to the increase of the \n\noperational pressure and temperature of the pipeline (CARDOSO, 2005).  \n\n \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Accident occurred in Guanabara Bay due to the lateral buckling of Petrobras\u2019 \n\npipeline PE-II. \n\n \n\nSource: adapted from Cardoso (2005). \n\n \n\nIn this context, studies related to buckling of pipelines are justified, because this \n\nphenomenon may lead to structural damages that may cause accidents. Accidents have \n\ndisastrous consequences for the economy, both as regards the loss of production and the \n\nreconstruction of damaged structures, and for the environment. Thus, their probability of \n\noccurrence must be minimized. \n\n \n\n1.1 OBJECTIVES  \n\n \n\nThe general objective of the present work is to analyze the upheaval instability \n\nof pipelines (flowlines) triggered by the internal pressure to which they are subjected during \n\nthe transportation of oil and gas from wellheads, experiencing different load approaches, \n\nboundary conditions and soil imperfections.  \n\nMore specifically, the objectives can be divided into two groups. The first, \n\nconcerning the procedures for modelling and analyzing the buckling phenomenon, aims at \n\nverifying and discussing the equivalence between different approaches for considering the \n\ninternal pressure: distributed loads dependent on pipeline curvature and equivalent compressive \n\naxial forces with follower and non-follower characteristics. It also discusses the influence of \n\nusing static or dynamic analysis for such approaches. The second group of objectives, \n\nOriginal configuration \n\nof the pipeline \n\nPost-buckling configuration of \n\nthe pipeline \nSoil displaced by the pipeline \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\nconcerning the buckling phenomenon properly speaking, aims at analyzing relatively two main \n\nparameters that can influence the buckling of pipelines regarding the critical load and the post-\n\nbuckling configuration: the isolated imperfections existing on the ground on which the pipeline \n\nis laid and the soil friction coefficients. \n\n  \n\n1.2 METHODOLOGY \n\n \n\nThe objectives proposed for the present work will be achieved through literature \n\nreview and numerical simulations. Concerning the theoretical part of this work, the topics \n\naddressed are: effective axial force, buckling of pipelines, stability of structures and contact \n\nmodels. The numerical simulations, in their turn, involve the development of models using \n\nfinite element software for nonlinear analysis Giraffe (Generic Interface Readily Accessible for \n\nFinite Elements), under continuous development at University of S\u00e3o Paulo. Such \n\ngeometrically nonlinear finite element models allow the consideration of large displacements \n\nand finite rotations, which can be especially important for the study of the pipeline post-\n\nbuckling configurations, which can, in their turn, play a fundamental role in the study of \n\npossible failure modes resulting from the buckling of pipelines. It is worth mentioning, \n\nhowever, that the study of such failure modes by itself is not in the scope of the present work. \n\nIn a first step, geometrically-simple pipeline models are simulated using \n\nTimoshenko beam elements, without the consideration of the contact between the pipeline and \n\nthe ground. The objective of such step is to understand the phenomenon of buckling due to \n\ninternal pressure for several simple cases, real or hypothetical, experiencing different boundary \n\nconditions and imperfection magnitudes. It also aims at discussing the equivalence between \n\napproaches that involve the application of the internal pressure as a distributed load dependent \n\non pipeline curvature and as an equivalent compression with follower and non-follower \n\ncharacteristics, besides discussing the influence of using static or dynamic analysis for such \n\napproaches.  \n\nIn a second step, more complex models are simulated, which involve, besides \n\nthe pipeline itself, the ground and the contact between the pipeline and ground. Varying \n\nparameters such as imperfection amplitudes and soil friction coefficients, the objective of the \n\nmodels is to determine the influence of these parameters in the buckling of pipelines, discussing \n\nrelatively how they modify the critical load and the post-buckling configuration of the pipeline. \n\nFor the two steps of numerical simulations, whenever possible, the results \n\nobtained numerically are compared to results obtained from existing analytical models. \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\n1.3 STRUCTURE OF THE WORK \n\n \n\nThe present work is structured into seven sections. \n\nSection 1 presents an introduction to buckling of pipelines, with the general \n\ndescription of the subject. It also includes the justification, the objectives and the methodology \n\nof the research.  \n\nSection 2 presents a bibliographic review about the following topics: pipe \n\nstrains, pipe stresses, effective axial force and buckling of pipelines. Through this section, the \n\nwork seeks, in addition to contextualizing the objectives and the methodology of the work, to \n\nprovide a theoretical basis for discussions presented in later sections.  \n\nSection 3 presents some aspects of stability of structures that are important to \n\nunderstand the numerical simulations performed by the present work. This section presents \n\ndiscussions about the existing methods to analyze stability problems and when each method \n\nshould be used. For that, a classification of forces that can act on a physical system is shown. \n\nSection 4 presents general concepts about contact models, besides some lines of \n\nresearches that have been developed in the area and the contact formulation used in the \n\nnumerical models presented later in the work. \n\nSection 5 describes the finite element models used to analyze the buckling of \n\npipelines and achieve the objectives proposed by the work, as well as presents the results \n\nobtained from the numerical simulations. \n\nSection 6 presents discussions about the results obtained from the numerical \n\nsimulations, often resorting to works presented in Section 2 and Section 3 to support them. \n\nSection 7 presents the conclusions of the work and indicates some \n\nrecommendations for future researches. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n2 LITERATURE REVIEW \n\n \n\nThis section presents an overview of buckling of pipelines. Firstly, some basic \n\nconcepts about pipe strains and stresses are highlighted for a better understanding of the \n\ninfluence of temperature and pressure in the pipe structure. Then, the main lines of research \n\nrelated to buckling of pipelines are summarized in order to contextualize the objectives of the \n\npresent work. Among them, including both analytical and numerical analyses, one may cite \n\nthose concerning the effective axial force, those concerning the buckling description and those \n\nconcerning the parameters that can influence the buckling of pipelines. \n\n \n\n2.1 STRAINS AND STRESSES \n\n \n\n2.1.1 Pipe strains \n\n \n\nAs mentioned in the introduction of the present work, HPHT pipelines tend to \n\nexpand longitudinally. This movement can be prevented partially or totally by the friction that \n\narises between the pipeline and the soil and by the end restraints. According to Bai and Bai \n\n(2014), the effects of temperature, pressure and friction can be discussed in terms of strains. As \n\nassumed by Bai and Bai (2014), the present work will also assume that the material of the \n\npipeline is elastic-linear. \n\nThe longitudinal strain ?, induced by a temperature change ?T, if there is no \nrestriction to the pipeline movement, is given by Eq. (1). The parameter ? is the linear thermal \ncoefficient of the pipeline material. It is worth mentioning that positive strains and stresses are \n\ntaken as being of tension. \n\n ?, = ??T  (1) \n \n\nThe longitudinal strain ?* induced by pressure, in its turn, has two components. \nThe first component consists in the strain ???? caused by the difference of longitudinal pressures \nbetween the sides of an end cap, if it exists in the pipeline. Considering the Hooke\u2019s law, such \n\nstrain can be determined through Eq. (2), in which p? is the external pressure, p? is the internal \npressure, A? is the external area of the pipeline cross section, A? is the internal bore area of the \npipeline cross section, A is the area of the pipeline cross section and E is the Young\u2019s modulus. \n\n\n\n34 \n\n ???? =  p?A??p?A?EA  (2) \n \n\nThe second component ?*+???+? of the longitudinal strain induced by pressure \nresults from Poisson effect and it is proportional to the hoop and radial strains. Such strain is \n\ngiven by Eq. (3), in which ? is the Poisson ratio. \n \n\n?*+???+? = ?  2?E ?p?A? ? p?A?A ? (3) \n \n\nIt can be noted that the strain caused by the end cap effect and the strain caused \n\nby the Poisson effect are opposed and ?*  can be given by Eq. (4).  \n \n\n?* =  31 ? 2?5E ?p?A? ? p?A?A ? (4) \n \n\nThe friction resistance developed between the pipeline and the soil consists in a \n\npassive effect, that is, it is activated only if the pipeline moves or tends to move, and tries to \n\navoid the strains caused by temperature and pressure. \n\nFor a pipeline that is not buried and does not have longitudinal movement \n\nrestriction at its ends, the strain ?? induced by friction is given by Eq. (5), which ?? is the axial \nfriction coefficient between the pipeline and the soil, R? is the normal force of contact per unit \nlength of pipeline and x? is the longitudinal coordinate with origin at the end of the pipeline. \n\n \n\n ?? = ? ??R?x?EA  (5) \n \n\nIf the pipeline is buried, the existing resistance to its movement is larger, since \n\nthere is the action of the soil around the whole pipeline cross section. One of the ways to \n\nestimate the axial friction force per unit length F] can be found in the recommended practice \nDNV-RP-F110 of Det Norske Veritas (2007) and in the guideline of American Society of Civil \n\nEngineers (2001). This force is shown in Eq. (6), which uses the following notation: D? is \nexternal diameter of the pipeline, ?? is the adhesion factor, C is the soil cohesion representative \nof the soil backfill, H is the buried depth of the pipeline centerline, ?? is the submerged weight \nof soil per unit volume, Km is the coefficient of pressure at rest and ?? is the internal angle of \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nfriction between the pipeline and the soil. \n\n F] =  ?D???C + ?D?H??31 + Km5tan 3??5/2 (6) \n \n\nWith such friction force, the strain ?? induced by friction for buried pipelines is \ngiven by Eq. (7). \n\n \n\n ?? = ? F]x?EA  (7) \n \n\nFinally, the total longitudinal strain ? of the pipeline, considering the effects of \ntemperature, pressure and friction, is given by Eq. (8). \n\n ? = ?, + ?* + ?? (8) \n \n\n2.1.2 Pipe stresses \n\n \n\nOnce the strains are partially or totally restrained in practice, axial stresses arise \n\nin the pipeline. For example, when a pipeline is completely restrained in the longitudinal \n\ndirection, the stress ?, induced by temperature change is given by Eq. (9). In terms of the force \nin the pipe wall, the temperature change ?T generates an axial force Pm,, given by Eq. (10). \n\n ?, = ?E??T (9) \n Pm,, = ?EA??T (10) \n \n\nConcerning the pressure effects in the pipeline, three components of stress can \n\nbe generated, even without restriction to movement: hoop stress (??), radial stress (?C) and \nlongitudinal stress (?B). Such stresses correspond to principal stresses if there are no shear \nstresses in directions of the cylindrical coordinate system. \n\nFor a thin-walled pipe, the radial stress is negligible and the longitudinal and \n\nhoop stresses are given by Eq. (11) and Eq. (12), respectively, in which t is the thickness of the \npipeline cross section and D? is the internal diameter of the pipeline. Two assumptions are made: \nthere are end caps and the pipeline is free to expand. Adaptations can be made in such \n\nexpressions to address other situations. \n\n\n\n36 \n\n ?B,?A?? = 3p?D? ? p?D?54t  (11) \n \n\n??,?A?? = 3p?D? ? p?D?52t  (12) \n \n\nFinally, for a thick-walled pipe, the radial, longitudinal and hoop stresses are \n\ngiven by Eq. (13), Eq. (14) and Eq. (15), respectively. The assumptions made for the thin-\n\nwalled pipe are still valid for the following equations and D is the diameter in which hoop stress \nor radial stress is calculated (YOUNG; BUDYNAS; SADEGH, 2011). \n\n \n\n?C,?A??? = p?D?6 ? p?D?6D?6 ? D? 6 ? D?\n6D? 6D6?D?6 ? D?6? 3p? ? p?5 (13) \n\n \n\n?B,?A??? = p?D?6 ? p?D? 6D?6 ? D?6  (14) \n \n\n??,?A??? = p?D?6 ? p?D?6D?6 ? D? 6 + D?\n6D? 6D6?D?6 ? D?6? 3p? ? p?5 (15) \n\n \n\nIn order to verify if the pipe subjected to the previous stresses is yielding, the \n\nVon Misses criterion can be used. Through such criterion, based on the distortion-energy \n\ntheory, the general form of the Von Misses stress (??), given by Eq. (16), has to be compared \nto the yielding strength of the pipe material. ?B?, ?BC and ??C are shear stresses. \n\n \n\n?? =  ?12 ?3?B ? ??56 + 3?? ? ?C56 +3?C ? ?B56 + 63?B?6 + ?BC6 + ??C65? (16) \n \n\nFor thin-walled pipes, Eq. (16) can be simplified, since ?C, ?B? and ?B? are \napproximately zero. Such simplification generates Eq. (17). \n\n \n\n?? =  ??B6 + ?? 6 ? ?B??+3??C6 (17) \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\n2.2 EFFECTIVE AXIAL FORCE \n\n \n\nTo analyze the global buckling of pipelines (lateral and upheaval buckling), the \n\nconcept of effective axial force must be introduced. The reason for such need is in the fact that \n\nthe axial force governing parameter, responsible for buckling, when pressure is present, is not \n\nthe integration of the longitudinal stresses, detailed in Section 2.1.2, on the pipeline cross \n\nsection. The axial force resulting from such integration is important to analyze local \n\nphenomena, such as local buckling, but not global phenomena. \n\nIt is important to have in mind that, for a global analysis, the effects of internal \n\nand external pressures can be analyzed by their integration on the internal and external wall \n\nareas of the pipeline, respectively. However, this procedure requires a lot of algebraic work \n\ndepending on pipe geometry, such as dealing with curved pipe configurations. Gay Neto, \n\nPimenta and Martins (2017) and therein referenced works discuss the topic, proposing, by the \n\nway, a formulation to apply the pressures as equivalent distributed loads that are dependent on \n\npipe curvature. Such formulation will be commented with more details later in the present work. \n\nAnother way for considering the pressure effects in the buckling of pipelines is \n\nanalyzing an equivalent force in the pipeline axial direction related to pressure loads. This \n\napproach, although easier, has to be used with caution since its physical interpretation is non-\n\ndirect. For example, pipelines without end caps and only subjected to internal pressure have the \n\ntendency of contraction in the axial direction. It happens because the existing tensile hoop stress \n\ngenerates, by Poisson effect, a compressive strain in the axial direction, if there is no restriction \n\nin the pipe. However, when the axial movement of the pipeline is restricted in practical \n\nsituations, a tensile stress arises in the pipeline. In this way, sometimes it is difficult to \n\nunderstand why pipelines buckle due to internal pressure. Actually, as aforementioned, the \n\nforce that governs the buckling of pipelines is not the real force given by the integration of the \n\nstresses on the cross section. This phenomenon is governed by the called effective axial force, \n\nwhich becomes compressive due to internal pressure. Therefore, there are other pressure effects \n\nin the pipeline axial direction besides the contribution of the Poisson effect.  \n\nSparks (1984) is one of the main authors who deal with the effective axial force. Fyrileiv and \n\nCollberg (2005), in their turn, summarize the knowledge about the topic. For the next \n\ndiscussions, based on the studies of the previous authors, consider the pipe segment shown in \n\nFigure 3 and the following additional notation: ds is the pipe segment length, T?T is the true \naxial force in the pipe wall (as a result of the integration of the stresses on the pipe cross section), dT?T is an infinitesimal change of T?T, w is the pipe self-weight per unit length, ?? is the specific \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\nmass of the internal fluid, ?? is the specific mass of the external fluid and g is the gravitational \nfield intensity.  \n\n \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Equivalent systems for pipelines subjected to internal and external pressures.   \n\n \n\nSource: adapted from Sparks (1984). \n\n \n\nA pipe segment without end caps and subjected to internal and external pressures \n\nis not a closed pressure field. Therefore, the Archimedes\u2019 principle cannot be applied. To apply \n\nsuch principle is necessary to transform the original pipe physical system into an equivalent \n\nsum of three different pipe physical systems. The first of the three physical systems is a closed \n\npipe on which acts the external pressure. By the Archimedes\u2019 principle, the action of the \n\nexternal pressure is equivalent to an upward-directed force. The magnitude of this force is the \n\nweight of the external fluid displaced by the pipe segment (buoyancy of the pipe). The second \n\nsystem is a closed pipe on which acts the internal pressure. The action of the internal pressure \n\nis equivalent to a downward-directed force. The magnitude of this force is the weight of the \n\ninternal fluid. Finally, the last physical system is a closed pipe on which act, besides the pipe \n\nself-weight and the true axial force, pressures at the pipe ends. These pressures have the \n\nopposite signs to those applied in the first and in the second physical systems, compensating \n\nthe additional terms included in those systems. Gay Neto, Pimenta and Martins (2017) discuss \n\nthe three systems performing the integration of the pressures on the internal and external wall \n\nareas of the pipeline.  \n\nThe effective axial force (Pm) is the resultant axial force at the pipe segment ends, \nwith positive values for tension and negative values for compression, given by Eq. (18). \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n\n Pm = T?T + p?A? ? p?A? (18) \n \n\nWith respect to Eq. (18), the term called true axial force T?T can be composed, \nfor example, by the contributions of the axial effect of temperature, the axial effect of soil \n\nfriction and the axial effect of pressure (the Poisson effect and the end cap effect \u2013 if there are \n\nend caps in the pipe indeed). Besides this, it is worth emphasizing that the present work has the \n\nobjective to analyze only the internal pressure effect as a constant value (and even without \n\nconsidering the internal hydrostatic pressure characterization). Thus, the term p?A? will be \ndisregarded in all analyses.  \n\n \n\n2.3 BUCKLING OF PIPELINES \n\n \n\nOnce understood the concept of effective axial force, it is necessary to know \n\nwhen such force causes buckling. Studies related to this subject are presented in the following \n\nsections, which deal with analytical and numerical analyses separately. \n\n \n\n2.3.1 Analytical analyses \n\n \n\nThere are analytical studies about buckling of pipelines with and without \n\nimperfections. These studies are discussed below and consider positive axial forces as being of \n\ncompression. \n\n \n\n2.3.1.1  Pipelines without imperfections \n\n \n\nHobbs (1984) was one of the first researchers to deal with buckling specifically \n\nin pipelines. His work involves studies about upheaval buckling and lateral buckling without \n\nimperfections.  \n\nFor the upheaval buckling, Hobbs (1984) summarizes the existing method and \n\nresults for railway tracks, since the same idea can be applied for pipelines. The analysis of \n\nupheaval buckling involves basically two regions: the deformed region of the pipeline (buckle \n\nregion) and the slip region. For the buckle region, Hobbs (1984) assumes the pipeline as a \n\nBernoulli-Euler beam that is subjected to an axial force P and to its self-weight and considers \nthat the problem is elastic-linear with small slopes. Besides this, Hobbs (1984) considers that \n\nthe soil is rigid and that the friction is fully mobilized. The analysis consists in solving the \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\ndifferential equation for the deflected pipeline. It is assumed that the shape of the buckle is one \n\nhalf-wave and that the bending moment at the lift-off point is zero. Figure 4 illustrates the \n\ndescribed model with the following notation: w is the pipeline self-weight per unit length (if \nthe pipeline is buried, the overburden is also included); L is the buckle length; ?? is the axial \nfriction coefficient between the pipeline and the soil,  L? is the length of the pipeline that slides \nin towards the buckle and s is the axial displacement that occurs at the lift-off point. \n\nFrom the assumptions made, the pipeline deflection v in y-direction can be \nobtained from the solution of Eq. (19), in which I is the second moment of area of the cross \nsection, v?? is the second derivative of the deflection with respect to the coordinate x and M is \nthe bending moment on the deflected pipeline. M can be obtained by Eq. (20) considering the \nparameters shown in Figure 4.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Hobbs\u2019 method for upheaval buckling of pipelines without imperfections \u2013 \n\ntopology and axial force distribution. \n\n \n\nSource: adapted from Hobbs (1984). \n\n M = EIv??   (19) \n \n\nM = ?Pv ? w8 3?L6 + 4x65 (20) \n \n\nSubstituting Eq. (20) into Eq. (19), Eq. (21) is obtained, in which the parameters m and n6 are, respectively, w EI?  and P EI? .  \n\n\n\n41 \n\n v?? + n6v + m8 3?L6 + 4x65 = 0 (21) \n \n\nThe solution of Eq. (21) is the sum of the solution vA of the equivalent \nhomogeneous differential equation with the particular solution v?. The solution of the \nequivalent homogeneous differential equation is given by Eq. (22), in which the constants A\" \nand A6 still need to be determined.   \n\n vA = A\" cos3nx5 + A6 sen3nx5 (22) \n \n\nThe particular solution, in its turn, is given by Eq. (23). \n\n \n\nv? = ? m2n6 x6 + m8n6 L6 + mni (23) \n \n\nTherefore, the expression for the pipeline deflection v can be obtained by Eq. \n(24). The pipeline slope v?, which is the first derivative of v with respect to the coordinate x, \ncan also be determined. Eq. (25) provides the expression for the slope.  \n\n \n\nv =  A\" cos3nx5 + A6sen3nx5 ? m2n6 x6 + m8n6 L6 + mni (24) \n \n\nv? = ?A\" sen3nx5 n + A6 cos3nx5 n ? mn6 x (25) \n \n\nThe deflection at the buckle ends and the slope at the midspan are zero. With \n\nsuch boundary conditions, the constants A\" and A6 can be obtained and Eq. (24) and Eq. (25) \ncan be rewritten. Eq. (26) and Eq. (27) are the final expressions for the deflection and for the \n\nslope, respectively. \n\n \n\nv =  mni \u00a3? cos 3nx5cos \u00a4n L2\u00a5 ?\nn6x62 + n6L68 + 1\u00a6 (26) \n\n \n\nv? =  mnicos \u00a4n L2\u00a5 nsen 3nx5 ?\nmn6 x (27) \n\n \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nAccording to Hobbs (1984), the relation between the axial force P and the buckle \nlength L can be obtained considering that the slope at the buckle ends also should be zero (rigid \nsoil). From such assumption, nL = 8.9868 is obtained. Therefore, the relation between P and L is given by Eq. (28). \n \n\nP = 80.76 EIL6 (28) \n \n\nSince the real length of the pipeline becomes larger than L after the buckling \n(there is a stress relief), the axial force P at the buckle is smaller than the axial force Pm away \nfrom the buckle. Figure 4 presents the axial force distribution along the buckle: the non-uniform \n\naxial force distributions correspond to the axial force distributions at the slip regions and the \n\ndiscontinuities correspond to the axial forces generated by the friction that arises from the \n\nvertical reactions w L 2?  at the lift-off points.  \nThe relation between P and Pm can be obtained from a compatibility equation for \n\naxial displacements.  As the buckling occurs, the buckle length increases. Obviously, the buckle \n\nlength differs from the pipeline arc length after the buckling, as previously mentioned.  The \n\ndifference between the pipeline arc length after the buckling (L\") and the buckle length (L5 is \ngiven by Eq. (29).  \n\n \n\nL\" ? L = \u00aa 3v?56dxB/6m  (29) \n \n\nTo maintain the equilibrium, L\" ? L has to be equal to the sum of the extension ? of the pipeline generated by the axial force variation with the inward displacement s that \noccurs at the slip length, which is not lifted off from the ground. The axial displacement s \nappears when the difference between Pm and P exceeds the friction force ??w L 2?  available at \nthe lift-off points.  \n\nThe extension of the pipeline generated by the axial force variation can be \n\nobtained by Eq. (30). \n\n \n\n? = 3Pm ? P5LEA  (30) \n \n\nWith respect to the axial displacement that occurs at the slip length, it is \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\nnecessary to first obtain the slip length. From Figure 4, Eq. (31) and Eq. (32) can be obtained. \n\nIt is worth remembering that the friction is assumed fully mobilized. \n\n \n\nPm ? ??wL? ? ?? wL2 = P (31) \n \n\nL? = 3Pm ? P5??w ? 0.5L (32) \n \n\nThen, the displacement s that occurs at the slip length can be found from Eq. \n(33) and Eq. (34): \n\n \n\ns = ??wL?L?EA  (33) \n \n\ns =  ?3Pm ?

(36). \n \n\nPm = P + wLEI ?0.00001597EA??wLj ? 0.253??EI56?\"/6  (36) \n \n\nOther parameters can also be found, as the maximum amplitude of the buckle v?, \nthe maximum bending moment Mu  and the maximum slope v?u  (? 0,1 for the assumption of small \nslopes). These parameters are shown, respectively, in Eq. (37), Eq. (38) and Eq.

In the Euler\u2019s \ncolumn buckling theory, since the position and the types of support are well defined, the buckle \n\nlength is known. However, this fact does not happen in the case of pipelines, which are in \n\ncontact with the soil. Once the buckle length is unknown, it is difficult to predict analytically \n\nthe load for which the pipeline buckles. Therefore, it is common to adopt certain values for the \n\nbuckle length and, then, obtain the loads P and Pm. The results can be summarized, for example, \nby graphs that relate the temperature rise (it can be obtained by Eq. (10) using Pm) or the pressure \nvariation (it can be obtained by Eq. (18) using Pm) and the buckle length or the buckle amplitude.  \n\nTo illustrate the formulation proposed by Hobbs (1984) for the upheaval \n\nbuckling, an example is shown below. The data are presented in Table 1. It is important to \n\nhighlight that Hobbs (1984) presents the results only in terms of temperature rise. As the present \n\nwork focuses on the internal pressure effect, besides the graph of temperature rise versus buckle \n\nlength (Figure 5), the graph of internal pressure versus buckle length is also presented in Figure \n\n6, for several coefficients of friction. As the external pressure is not considered, the pressure \n\nvariation is equal to the internal pressure. At this point of the work, the only concern is the \n\npresentation of the results obtained by Hobbs (1984). The best way to apply the internal \n\npressure, as well as the verification of equivalence between the various possible load \n\napproaches, will be discussed in the numerical analyses presented later in this work. \n\n \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Numerical example data for the analytical models. \n\nDe (m) t (m) A (m2) I (m4) w (kN/m) E (GPa) ?

The possible lateral buckling modes are \n\nrepresented in Figure 7. It is worth mentioning that, in the lateral buckling, the deflection v does \nnot belong to the vertical plane, but to the horizontal plane, in which the buckling occurs. \n\nTherefore, to generalize, the present work considers that the deflection v occurs in the direction \nperpendicular to the pipeline axis in the buckling plane (horizontal plane for lateral buckling, \n\nfor example). \n\n \n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Hobbs\u2019 method for upheaval buckling of pipelines without imperfections \u2013 \n\ntemperature rise versus buckle length. \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\nFigure 6 \u2013 Hobbs\u2019 method for upheaval buckling of pipelines without imperfections \u2013 internal \n\npressure versus buckle length. \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nFigure 7 \u2013 Lateral buckling modes. \n\n \n\nSource: adapted from Hobbs (1984). \n\n \n\nThe author, to simplify the study, adopts initially a buckling mode with infinite \n\nseries of half-waves to derive the expressions for lateral buckling, since the soil cannot be \n\nconsidered rigid in this type of buckling and the assumption of concentrated reactions at the \n\nends of the buckle would not be true.  \n\nThe analysis of the infinite buckling mode does not cause many modifications \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\nin the differential equation that governs the buckle, Eq. (21), except that the parameter m \nbecomes ?Bw EI? , in which ?B is the lateral friction coefficient between the pipeline and the \nsoil. Besides this, there is a modification in the boundary condition used to determine the \n\nrelation between P and L. Hobbs (1984) imposes that the shear force at x = \u00b1 L 2?  is equal to \nzero. Although this condition seems to be incoherent, the formulation proposed by Hobbs \n\n(1984) will be shown and, then, relevant discussions will be performed. From the condition, nL = 2? is obtained. Therefore, the relation between P and L is given by Eq. (42).  \n \n\nP = 4?6 EIL6 (42) \n \n\nIn the infinite buckling mode, there is no slip length. Therefore, the compatibility \n\nequation is given by Eq. (40) and the relation between P and Pm can be obtained by Eq. (43). \n \n\nPm = P + 0.00004705 ?B6w6EAL\u00ae3EI56  (43) \n \n\nOther parameters can also be found, as the maximum amplitude of the buckle v?, \nthe maximum bending moment Mu  and the maximum slope v?u  (? 0,1 for the assumption of small \nslopes). These parameters are shown, respectively, in Eq. (44), Eq. (45) and Eq. (46). \n\n \n\nv? = 0.0044495 ?BwLiEI  (44) \n Mu = 0.05066?BwL6   (45) \n \n\nv?u = 0.01267 ?BwLIEI  (46) \n \n\nAs commented in advance, the imposition of null shear forces at x = \u00b1 L 2?  for \nthe infinite mode seems to be incoherent, since the problem is antisymmetric. And, in fact, the \n\npoints x = \u00b1 L 2?  consist in points of inflection, in which the bending moments are zero, but \nthe shear forces are not. More recently, Peek (2009) also detects such problem and proposes a \n\nformulation without the assumption of Hobbs (1984). Without going into too much details, his \n\nformulation is described below. Peek (2009) does not establish an explicit equation that relates \n\n\n\n48 \n\n P and L. For the determination of the critical load Pm, the author determines L for which the ratio \nbetween L\" ? L and L is minimum. With  L, Peek (2009) determines P for which Pm is minimum \nthrough expressions which provide from the compatibility condition. The author concludes that \n\nresults are not much different from those obtained by Hobbs (1984). For a specific numerical \n\nexample, the author shows that the critical force obtained by Hobbs (1984) is only 1.4% larger \n\nthan that obtained using the new conditions. So, the boundary conditions do not seem to change \n\nthe results very much. \n\nHobbs (1984) also summarizes the work of Kerr (1978), who addresses the \n\nlateral buckling that occurs in railway tracks using the principle of virtual displacements and \n\nthe variational calculus, and Martinet (1936 apud HOBBS, 1984, p. 181) to detail the buckling \n\nmodes 1, 2, 3 and 4. Considering that L is the half-wavelength of the most significant part of \nthe buckle and using the constants shown in Table 2, the expressions for the lateral buckling \n\nare given by Eq. (47), Eq. (48), Eq. (49) and Eq. (50). It is worth mentioning that, for Hobbs \n\n(1984), there is no difference between lateral and axial friction coefficients. However, as some \n\nauthors consider such difference in later works, the following expressions incorporate \n\nseparately the lateral friction coefficient and the axial friction coefficient.  \n\n \n\nP =  k\" EIL6 (47) \n \n\nPm =  P + kI??wL \u00b0\u00b11 + k6 EA?B6wLj??3EI56 \u00b2\nm.j ? 1\u00b3 (48) \n\n \n\nv? = ki ?BwLiEI  (49) \n Mu = kj?BwL6   (50) \n \n\nTable 2 \u2013 Constants for lateral buckling modes. \n\nMode k1 k2 k3 k4 k5 \n\n1 80.76 0.00006391 0.500 0.002407 0.06938 \n\n2 4\u00b46 0.00017430 1.000 0.005532 0.10880 \n3 34.06 0.00016680 1.294 0.010320 0.14340 \n\n4 28.20 0.00021440 1.608 0.010470 0.14830 \n\nSource: Hobbs (1984). \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\nTo illustrate the formulation proposed by Hobbs (1984) for the lateral buckling, \n\nan example is shown below.

According to the author, these results are not true if the pipeline \n\nis buried, since the lateral resistance becomes larger and does not allow the pipeline to buckle \n\nin the horizontal plane. Considering that the pipeline is not buried, the axial force for which the \n\npipeline buckles is smaller for the buckling modes 2, 3 and 4 than for the buckling modes 1 and \n\ninfinite.  \n\nIt is worth reinforcing that Hobbs (1984) does not consider imperfections in his \n\nmodels, although the author highlights its importance since perfect pipelines do not buckle and \n\nreal pipelines have imperfections. These imperfections can be, for example, irregularities of the \n\nground and initial out-of-straightness due to the laying operations. \n\n \n\n2.3.1.2  Pipelines with imperfections \n\n \n\nConsidering the need for new researches in the field pointed by Hobbs (1984), \n\nTaylor and Gan (1986) perform similar analyses to the work of the previous author. They study \n\nboth upheaval buckling and lateral buckling (modes 1 and 2) and assume small deflections and \n\nelastic-linear behavior of the pipe material. In their work, however, there is the consideration \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\nof structural imperfections. Beyond the consideration of such imperfections, the authors \n\nconsider a deformation-dependent axial friction, that is, the friction is not fully mobilized.  \n\nConcerning the axial friction model assumed by Taylor and Gan (1986), it is \n\ngiven by Eq. (51), in which ?? is the fully mobilized axial friction coefficient, u? is the axial \ndisplacement corresponding to ??, u is the real axial displacement of the pipeline at the slip \nregion and f? is the axial friction parameter corresponding to u. It is worth highlighting that the \nconvention used in the expression considers that the friction force that arises at the slip region \n\nand the displacement have the same orientation. If this convention is not used, the exponent of \n\nEq. (51) has to become negative. \n\n f??? = 1 ? e\n6joo?  (51) \n\n \n\nUsing the previous axial friction model, the authors study first the upheaval \n\nbuckling. The same notation used to explain the work of Hobbs (1984) will be used here to \n\npresent the formulation proposed by Taylor and Gan (1986). However, some new parameters \n\nhave to be introduced: vm is the vertical deflection of the conformal imperfection topology, v?m \nis the maximum vertical amplitude of the conformal imperfection topology, Lm is the buckle \nlength of the conformal imperfection topology, nm is equal to wPmm EI?  and Pmm is the axial force \nat the buckle region for the initial configuration. The model is represented in Figure 18. \n\nWith Eq. (26) and Eq. (37), proposed by Hobbs (1984), Taylor and Gan (1986) \n\nobtain Eq. (52) for the pipeline deflection, which is dependent on the maximum buckle \n\namplitude. The parameter K\" used in Eq. (52) is 15.698465.  \n \n\nv =  v?K\" \u00a3? cos3nx5cos \u00a4n L2\u00a5 ?\nn6x62 + n6L68 + 1\u00a6 (52) \n\n  \n\nIt can be noted from Figure 18 that the pipeline is totally in contact with the \n\nimperfection in the initial configuration. It can be interpreted as a vertical deviation from the \n\nidealized lay proposed by Hobbs (1984). The authors, however, consider the problem as stress-\n\nfree-when-initially-deformed. The imperfection is idealized to have the same shape of the final \n\nconfiguration of the pipeline, but in a smaller scale. Therefore, the shape of the imperfection \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\ncan be obtained from Eq. (52) and Eq. (37) substituting the buckle parameters by the \n\nimperfection parameters. Such substitution results in Eq. (53) and Eq. (54). \n\n \n\nFigure 18 \u2013 Taylor and Gan\u2019s method for upheaval buckling of pipelines with conformal \n\nimperfections \u2013 topology and axial force distribution. \n\n \n\nSource: adapted from Taylor and Gan (1986). \n\n  \n\nvm =  v?mK\" \u00a3? cos 3nmx5cos \u00a4nm Lm2 \u00a5 ?\nnm6x62 + nm6Lm68 + 1\u00a6             ?Lm2 ? x ?

To solve the problem, for a known parameter v?m Lm?  and several arbitrary values of L from Lm, it is necessary to employ a nonlinear iterative algorithm, for example, Newton-\nRaphson method. Using this method, Pm ? P and s can be found. Besides this, through Eq. (57), P and, consequently, Pm can be determined. As it was already reported by Hobbs (1984), the \nresults can be summarized, for example, by graphs that relate the temperature rise or the \n\npressure variation and the buckle length or the buckle amplitude.  \n\nBased on the data presented in Table 1, numerical results are presented below \n\nusing the formulation proposed by Taylor and Gan (1986). The analyses are made with values \n\nof v?m Lm?  between 0.003 and 0.010.

In Figure 19, for \n\nexample, small imperfections cause the snap-through phenomenon. As the imperfection \n\namplitudes increase, the critical loads decrease. \n\n \n\nFigure 26 \u2013 Taylor and Gan\u2019s method for lateral buckling (mode 2) of pipelines with \n\nconformal imperfections \u2013 internal pressure versus buckle length. \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\nThe amount of existing analytical studies related to buckling of pipelines with \n\nimperfections is quite large since the imperfections can assume many shapes. However, in \n\ngeneral, the same kind of qualitative conclusions obtained by Taylor and Gan (1986) are \n\nobtained by other authors. In order not to make the work so extensive, only one more study is \n\nsummarized in order to illustrate another mechanism of buckling of pipelines caused by a \n\ndifferent type of imperfection. The work chosen to be discussed, Taylor and Tran (1996), is \n\nreference in the literature, being cited by many other authors. Besides this, it will be the basis \n\nof comparison for the numerical results of the present work. \n\nTaylor and Tran (1996) discuss imperfections focusing on the upheaval buckling. \n\nThe authors divide the isolated imperfections that can occur in the vertical plane into three \n\ndifferent types. The first imperfection is that in which the pipeline is totally in contact with the \n\nground, as proposed by Taylor and Gan (1986). The second type, on the other hand, is an \n\nimperfection that is not totally in contact with the ground. Thus, there are voids between the \n\npipeline and the ground. Finally, the third type consists in the second type of imperfection, but, \n\nin this case, the voids become filled by sand or other materials. The third case can be understood \n\nas a particular case of the first case. Taylor and Tran (1996) focus on the second type of \n\nimperfection, called prop imperfection, presenting a mathematical formulation that considers \n\nthe following assumptions: the imperfections are symmetrical, the soil is rigid, the deflections \n\nare small, the material is elastic-linear and the friction is fully mobilized. \n\nA prop imperfection is generated by irregularities of the ground, which can be \n\nprovided from natural conditions as, for example, the presence of rocks, or from the \n\nundercrossing of nonparallel pipelines. Basically, according to Taylor and Tran (1996), the \n\nupheaval buckling in pipelines that are laid on such prop imperfections has four stages, which \n\nthe authors call: datum establishment, pre-upheaval flexure, upheaval and post-upheaval \n\nbuckling. Each of these stages are summarized below. \n\nThe stage called datum establishment consists in the determination of the initial \n\nconfiguration assumed by the pipeline after the laying operations, considering that there is a \n\ndeviation from the idealized lay caused by the prop imperfection. The authors consider that \n\nsuch deflected configuration is stress free. In this stage, there is no axial force, since the pipeline \n\nis still empty. So, the pipeline is only subject to its self-weight and to the force of the prop \n\nimperfection, which can be understood as an existing reaction at the point where the pipeline \n\nrests on the imperfection. The topology assumed by the authors is presented in Figure 27, in \n\nwhich L? is the initial buckle length of the pipeline caused by the prop imperfection, F? is the \ninitial shear force at the prop imperfection, which is half of the total prop force, and N? is the \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\ninitial maximum bending moment at the prop imperfection. \n\n   \n\nFigure 27 \u2013 Taylor and Tran\u2019s method for upheaval buckling of pipelines with prop \n\nimperfection \u2013 datum establishment topology. \n\n \n\nSource: adapted from Taylor and Tran (1996). \n\n \n\nThe bending moment M? on the pipeline, for the datum state, can be obtained by \nEq. (80). \n\n \n\nM? = ?  F?L?2 + wL?68 + F?x ? wx62  (80) \n \n\nFrom Eq. (19), the differential equation of the deflected pipeline is given by Eq. \n\n(81), in which v? is the deflection of the pipeline laid on the prop imperfection and v??? is the \nsecond derivative of v? with respect to x. \n\n \n\nv??? = 1EI \u00ca?

(82). \n\n \n\nv? = w72EI \u00b12L? ?L?2 ? x?I ? 3 ?L?2 ? x?i\u00b2 (82) \n \n\nThe relation between L? and the maximum vertical amplitude v?? of the prop \n\n\n\n68 \n\n \n\nimperfection is given by Eq.

This reduction \nhappens until L? reaches a specific value Lo, for which the pipeline loses its contact with the \nprop imperfection, that is, the prop force becomes zero. The described stage corresponds to the \n\ncalled pre-upheaval flexure. Figure 28 illustrates the topology and the axial force distribution \n\nof this stage, in which N is the maximum bending moment at the prop imperfection. \nThe relation between the bending moment M and the curvature of the deflected \n\npipeline with prop imperfection can be obtained by Eq. (85). \n\n \n\nFigure 28 \u2013 Taylor and Tran\u2019s method for upheaval buckling of pipelines with prop \n\nimperfection \u2013 pre-upheaval flexure topology and axial force distribution. \n\n \n\nSource: adapted from Taylor and Tran (1996). \n\n\n\n69 \n\n MEI = v?? ? v???

(87) \n \n\n It can be noted that, although the curvature at the lift-off point of the deflected \n\npipeline is required to be zero, the bending moment at this point is not zero due to the stress-\n\nfree-when-initially-deformed pipeline assumption, which subtracts the product EIv??? from the \nproduct EIv?? at the lift-off point for obtaining the final bending moment. It can be understood \nby Eq. (88), derived from Eq. (85). \n\n \n\nM ?L2? = EIv?? ?L2? ? EIv??? ?L2? = ?EIv??? ?L2? (88) \n \n\nThe bending moment M can be obtained by Eq.

This region can be analyzed in the same way as it is done for the upheaval buckling case of \nthe study of Taylor and Gan (1986). The difference is that Taylor and Tran (1996) do not \n\nconsider a deformation-dependent axial friction. With such assumption, Eq. (63) becomes Eq. \n\n(96). Eq. (64) is still valid. \n\n \n\n3Pm ? P5 = ?2??wEA3?s5?m.j + ?? ?w L2 ? F? (96) \n \n\nFor a specific imperfection length L?, the solution for the pre-upheaval flexure \ncan be obtained from the determination of the axial displacement s at the lift-off point from Eq. \n(64) and Eq. (96) using a nonlinear iterative algorithm for several values of L from L? to Lo. Lo \nis the buckle length which occurs when F = 0. With s, Pm can be determined. \n\nThe next stage called upheaval by Taylor and Tran (1996) corresponds to the \n\ninstant when the prop force becomes zero, that is, the pipeline loses its contact with the \n\nimperfection.  It can be demonstrated that such stage occurs when nL = 6.857667 and L? L? =1.3421, if the pipeline is considered stress-free-when-initially-deformed. Therefore, the \nrelation between Po, the axial force at the buckle region when F becomes zero, and Lo is given \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\nby Eq. (97). If the pipeline is not considered stress-free-when-initially-deformed, the relation \n\nbetween Po and Lo is given by Eq. (98). \n \n\nPo = 42.027 EI30.7451L?56 (97) \n \n\nPo = 80.76 EI30.775L?56 (98) \n \n\nIt can be noted that, when the pipeline is considered stress-free-when-initially-\n\ndeformed, the axial force necessary to cause upheaval buckling of a pipeline laid on a prop \n\nimperfection is 63% of the axial force necessary to cause upheaval buckling of an idealized \n\npipeline, which is given by Eq. (28). So, as expected, the idealized model is not on the security \n\nside. \n\nFrom the upheaval stage, with the continuous increase of the axial force P by \ntemperature and internal pressure, the buckle length starts to increase from Lo. This movement \nis called post-upheaval buckling by the authors and can be subdivided into two stages. The first \n\ncorresponds to the stage in which L &lt;L? and the second corresponds to the stage in which L >L?. For the first case, Figure 29 illustrates the topology and the axial force distribution. \nThe relation between the bending moment M and the curvature of the deflected \n\npipeline with prop imperfection can be obtained again by Eq. (85) as well as the boundary \n\nconditions of the Eq. (85) can be obtained by Eq. (86) and Eq. (99). \n\n v305 = v?  (99) \n \n\nThe bending moment M can be obtained by Eq.

For a specific imperfection length L?, the solution for the post-upheaval buckling stage \ncan be obtained in the same way as it is obtained for the pre-upheaval stage using values of L \nfrom Lo.  \n\nFinally, the last stage that occurs in the upheaval buckling is the post-upheaval \n\nbuckling with L > L?.

However, the \n\nexisting studies are not restricted to this case. Ballet and Hobbs (1992), for example, propose a \n\nformulation for the pre-upheaval stage of buckling of pipelines laid on prop imperfections \n\nwhich considers that the configuration of the pipeline after the laying process is not symmetric \n\nwith respect to the prop. Although the authors do not show a complete formulation, through \n\ngraphs of temperature rise versus buckle amplitude for a numerical example, Ballet and Hobbs \n\n(1992) point out that the asymmetrical buckling is possible and that the critical load is smaller \n\nin the asymmetrical case than in the symmetrical case. Hunt and Blackmore (1997) also study \n\nthe asymmetrical buckling dealing with an imperfection that has the shape of a step. According \n\nto the authors, this type of imperfection has a greater destabilizing effect than the prop \n\nimperfection. \n\nAs a result of various existing analytical models for buckling of pipelines with \n\nimperfection, an interesting aspect to be discussed is how the standards deal with such subject. \n\nThe recommended practice DNV-RP-F110 of Det Norske Veritas (2007), for example, \n\nproposes three possible global buckling scenarios:  exposed pipelines on even ground, exposed \n\npipelines on uneven ground and buried pipelines. The first scenario does not imply that \n\nimperfections are not considered. The imperfections exist, but only in the horizontal plane, in \n\nwhich, by the way, the buckling occurs. In the second scenario, besides the possibility of \n\noccurrence of lateral imperfections, there are also vertical imperfections. Thus, the global \n\ndeformation occurs first in the vertical plane and, then, in the horizontal plane. Finally, the third \n\ncase is related to buried pipelines which can be subjected to upheaval buckling.  \n\nAn important aspect is that the recommended practice does not consider the \n\noccurrence of buckling as an impediment for the design of pipelines, that is, buckling can occur \n\nas long as the integrity of the post-buckling configuration is ensured. Such integrity is verified \n\nthrough design criteria related to failure modes such as local buckling, fracture and fatigue. For \n\nthe specific case of the recommended practice DNV-RP-F110 of Det Norske Veritas (2007), \n\nexposed pipelines are designed to buckle in a controlled manner and buried pipelines are \n\n\n\n76 \n\n \n\ndesigned not to buckle. Besides this, as information, since the topic does not belong to the scope \n\nof the research, the recommended practice DNV-RP-F110 of Det Norske Veritas (2007) deals \n\nonly with local buckling. Other failure modes can be found in the offshore standard DNV-OS-\n\nF101 of Det Norske Veritas (2013). \n\nTo verify the susceptibility of global buckling, the recommended practice DNV-\n\nRP-F110 of Det Norske Veritas (2007) establishes that for the first and the third scenarios there \n\nis the possibility of using the analytical models, as those reviewed in this work. The \n\nrecommended practice also proposes some simplified procedures. However, it recommends that \n\nanalytical procedures are used only at the conceptual design phase, because they have so many \n\nlimitations, such as: elastic-linear material behavior, simplified axial and lateral soil-pipeline \n\ninteraction, small rotation theory and imposed shape of initial and post-buckling configurations \n\naccording to assumed buckling mode, that is, the critical load is related to an assumed buckling \n\nmode that may differ from the real pipeline as-laid configuration. Therefore, the finite element \n\nmethod (FEM) should be used to perform the analyses. It allows, among other things, to model \n\nnonlinear material behavior, to use large deflection theory and to model soil profiles more \n\nrealistically. The next section describes some researches that have been carried out using \n\nnumerical analyses with FEM. \n\n \n\n2.3.2 Numerical analyses \n\n \n\nRecent studies, besides analytical analysis, propose numerical analysis. Through \n\nnumerical analysis using FEM, for example, it is possible to simulate more complex and more \n\nrealistic models of pipelines that could not be solved by analytical methods. As mentioned, the \n\ncontact between the pipeline and the soil, for example, can be simulated using arbitrary soil \n\nprofiles. Furthermore, it is possible to simulate nonlinear material properties and use large \n\ndeflection theory (physical and geometrical nonlinearities, respectively).  \n\nLiu et al. (2014), for example, use four numerical simulation methods in finite \n\nelement software ABAQUS to analyze the lateral buckling of pipelines under high \n\ntemperatures. These four methods are separated into two main groups. The first group is related \n\nto 2D models. These models represent the pipeline through beam elements and the ground \n\nthrough a rigid flat surface. Contact elements are created between the pipeline and the ground, \n\nrepresenting their normal and tangential contacts. The second group, in its turn, is related to 3D \n\nmodels. In these models, both the pipeline and the ground are represented by solid elements. \n\nThe contact between the pipeline and the ground occurs in three directions and the constitutive \n\n\n\n77 \n\n \n\nmodel for the soil is the Mohr-Coulomb model. Unlike 2D models, 3D models can simulate the \n\npenetration of the pipeline into the ground, capturing the resulting increase of lateral resistance. \n\nIt is also worth mentioning that both 2D and 3D models use elastic-linear materials and that the \n\nsequence of load application is the same: first there is the introduction of the initial curved \n\nconfiguration of the pipeline to simulate the initial lateral imperfection, then the pipe self-\n\nweight is applied and, finally, the temperature rise is also introduced. \n\nEach of the previous two groups are simulated using two types of analysis, \n\ntotalizing the four numerical simulation methods used by the authors. The first analysis \u201c[\u2026] \n\ncontrols the stable structure displacement and addresses the static equilibrium of the unstable \n\nresponse segment in implicit analysis [\u2026]\u201d (LIU et al., 2014, p. 64). The second analysis is \n\n\u201c[\u2026] the acceleration control method in which inertia controls acceleration and addresses the \n\nsteady structure displacement in explicit analysis [\u2026]\u201d (LIU et al., 2014, p. 64). \n\nWith the results obtained from the four simulations, such as the pipeline global \n\nbuckling shapes, the buckle amplitudes and the critical temperature rise, for a specific case \n\nstudy, Liu et al. (2014) compare them to each other. Besides this, the authors compare the \n\nresults of the 2D implicit model to the results obtained from the analytical model proposed by \n\nTaylor and Gan (1986). The authors conclude that are some differences between 2D models \n\nand 3D models. According to the authors, such differences occur because the 3D models \n\nincorporate the increase of lateral resistance providing from the penetration of the pipeline into \n\nthe soil. With the increase of the lateral resistance, the critical temperatures are larger and the \n\nbuckle amplitudes are smaller than those that occur in 2D models. Comparing the results \n\nobtained from the implicit and explicit analyses, the results also differ. According to Liu et al. \n\n(2014), although the critical loads are similar, the explicit analysis considers the influence of \n\nspeed in the buckling phenomenon and part of the work generated by internal forces is \n\nconverted into kinetic energy. In other words, more axial stress is required to attain the same \n\ndeformation amplitude as that attained by the implicit analysis. Finally, concerning the \n\ncomparison between the results of the 2D implicit model and the results obtained from the \n\nanalytical model proposed by Taylor and Gan (1986), some differences occur because the \n\nanalytical model assumes that the final buckled configuration of the pipeline has the same shape \n\nof the imperfect initial configuration. In the numerical analysis, it can be noted that it does not \n\nhappen. The resulting differences are: the buckle amplitudes are on the security side in the \n\nanalytical model, but the critical temperature, contrary, is not.  \n\nIt is clearly shown by the previous work that, depending on the assumptions \n\nmade and on the type analysis chosen, the results may change completely. Thus, the process of \n\n\n\n78 \n\n \n\nmodeling in numerical analysis must be done carefully and in a consistent way with the \n\nconditions that exist in practice. In general, the representation of pipelines by means of beam \n\nelements brings significant reduction in the computational cost, when compared to shell/solid \n\nmodels. Besides this, depending on the type of analysis required, with more or less details, this \n\nassumption provides suitable results for the global phenomenon of buckling of pipelines, being \n\nused by many authors. For local phenomena, however, more complex models can be desirable. \n\nContinuing in the context of the FEM, for the upheaval case proposed by Taylor \n\nand Gan (1986), for example, Liu, Wang and Yan (2013), besides analytical formulation, \n\ndevelop an elastoplastic analysis for buckling of pipelines using finite element software \n\nABAQUSTM. The authors apply such methods in a practical case in China. The study is made \n\nbased on temperature rises that play the role of temperature and pressure increases, jointly. The \n\nconclusions of the work are similar to those reached by other researches: the critical load \n\ndepends on the imperfection amplitude. Furthermore, for the same imperfection amplitudes, the \n\ncritical load is larger when the covered depth and the soil strength are larger.  \n\nThe work of Zeng, Duan and Che (2014), in its turn, simulates, using \n\nABAQUSTM, the upheaval buckling of pipelines caused by high temperature for three different \n\ngroups of rigid conformal imperfections. To define the groups, the research considers \n\nparameters as the imperfection amplitude, the imperfection length and the imperfection shape. \n\nBased on comparisons between the three groups of imperfection, the authors conclude that \n\nwhen the ratio between the imperfection amplitude and the imperfection length increases, \n\nbuckling occurs with smaller critical loads and less abruptly. The same occurs for compacted \n\nimperfections. The authors also propose approximated formulas, based on the results obtained \n\nfrom the numerical analyses, to determine the critical loads for the analyzed imperfections, \n\nwhich depend on the ratio between the imperfection amplitude and the imperfection length. \n\nZhang and Duan (2015) employ the FEM to study the upheaval buckling and to \n\nperform similar analysis to Zeng, Duan and Che (2014). The objective of the authors is to \n\ndetermine an expression for the critical load, which depends on the ratio between the \n\nimperfection amplitude and the imperfection length and on the ratio between the curvature of \n\nthe imperfection and the imperfection length. Unlike the formulas proposed by Zeng, Duan and \n\nChe (2014), which are specific for each of the three imperfection groups analyzed, the formula \n\nproposed by Zhang and Duan (2015) intends to be universal.  Such formula is presented in Eq. \n\n(111), in which ?:<= is the maximum value of negative curvature radius of the conformal \nimperfection. \n\n \n\n\n\n79 \n\n \n\nP =  ?0.032 Lmv?m ? 2.003 ?:<=Lm + 1.404? 3w6EI5\"I (111) \n \n\nFor achieving that, the authors simulate pipelines in software ABAQUSTM with \n\neight different conformal imperfection types. For each imperfection type, in its turn, the authors \n\nsimulate pipelines with ten different ratios between the imperfection amplitude and the \n\nimperfection length. Based on the results and using linear regression, the authors determine Eq. \n\n(111) for the critical load. Zhang and Duan (2015) concludes that, for the same ratio between \n\nthe curvature of the imperfection and the imperfection length, when the ratio between the \n\nimperfection amplitude and the imperfection length increases, the critical load decreases. \n\nBesides this, for the same ratio between the imperfection amplitude and the imperfection length, \n\nwhen the ratio between the curvature of the imperfection and the imperfection length increases, \n\nthe critical load decreases. \n\nBesides studies about the influence of imperfections in the buckling of pipelines, \n\nthere are studies that simulate practical cases of pipelines, applying both temperature and \n\npressure loads and modeling the soil profile. In such cases, the objective is usually to know if \n\ncertain pipelines are or not likely to buckle. Isaac (2013), for example, analyzes a specific case \n\nstudy with soil-pipeline contact and temperature and pressure loads. The objective is to know \n\nif the pipeline buckles and what is the best lay configuration that would allow controlling the \n\nbuckling of the pipeline. The author concludes that the snake lay is an option to control the \n\nlateral buckling. The snake lay triggers buckles at pre-determined locations along the pipeline, \n\ncontrolling the global buckling. For the case study, the author determines the best number of \n\nsnakes to share the expansion under thermal and pressure loads. \n\nWith the few studies discussed in the present section, it is possible to exemplify \n\nthe advances provided by the use of FEM. These advances are not only restricted to a more \n\nrealistic modeling of pipelines. The FEM is also a tool that helps to analyze which are the \n\nparameters, such as the imperfections, in large or small scale, that can influence the global \n\nbuckling of pipelines. The tool also helps in the derivation of practical formulas that can be \n\nused by the designers. \n\n \n\n2.3.3 Contextualization of objectives and methodology \n\n \n\nAs mentioned in Section 1.1, the general objective of the present work is to \n\n\n\n80 \n\n \n\nanalyze the upheaval instability of pipelines triggered by internal pressure. First of all, it is \n\nimportant to say that, given the large number of possible studies on buckling of pipelines, it \n\nwas decided to study only the upheaval case. With respect to the triggering load, in its turn, an \n\naspect that is worth to be discussed is that all works exposed previously, both those related to \n\nanalytical and numerical analysis, do not analyze specifically the effects of internal pressure. \n\nAlthough they have comments about pressure, Hobbs (1984), Taylor and Gan (1986), Taylor \n\nand Tran (1996), Ballet and Hobbs (1992), Liu, Wang and Yan (2013), and Zeng, Duan and \n\nChe (2014), for example, analyze the critical load only in terms of critical temperature rise. Liu, \n\nWang and Yan (2013), by the way, consider that part of the temperature rise refers to pressure. \n\nIt is clear that the objective of the works is to determine the magnitude of the critical load \n\ngenerically, regardless of the cause of the axial force. The use of the temperature is just a way \n\nto have some kind of practical measure for the critical load. Pressure could be used, making it \n\npossible to interpret the order of magnitude of the critical loads in terms of internal pressure. \n\nOther researches, in their turn, simulate practical cases of pipelines, applying both temperature \n\nand pressure load. In such cases, the objective is usually to know if certain pipelines are or not \n\nlikely to buckle. So, the focus is not on the triggering load. The work of Isaac (2013) can be \n\ncited in this context. \n\nWorks that are really concerned with the role of the internal pressure in the \n\nbuckling of pipelines are few. Dvorkin and Toscano (2001), for example, analyze, using the \n\nfinite difference method to determine the pressure load, the global buckling in pipelines that are \n\nsubjected to internal and external pressures, besides compressive axial forces (they can be \n\nassociated with temperature, for example). According to Dvorkin and Toscano (2001), \n\nimperfect pipelines have a resultant force providing from pressure loads that has a tendency to \n\nmodify the pipe curvature. When internal pressure is larger than external pressure, it results in \n\na destabilizing load pointing from the center of curvature and the critical load is smaller than \n\nthe critical load in perfect pipelines. The inverse situation, in its turn, generates a stabilizing \n\nload and the critical load is larger than the critical load in perfect pipelines. Other qualitative \n\nconclusion, similar to that obtained by other authors, is that smaller imperfections cause critical \n\nloads closer to critical loads of perfect pipelines than larger imperfections. \n\nGiven the limited amount of discussion about the internal pressure in the context \n\nof buckling of pipelines, the general objective of the present work is justified. Using different \n\napproaches for considering the internal pressure, the simple and advanced numerical \n\nsimulations of the present work allow to discuss the works of Sparks (1984) and Fyrileiv and \n\nCollberg (2005), which deal with the concept of effective axial force, as well as the work of \n\n\n\n81 \n\n \n\nGay Neto, Pimenta and Martins (2017), which deals with a specific formulation for applying \n\nthe internal pressure as a distributed load dependent on pipe curvature. Such formulation, which \n\nconstitutes an advance of the formulation proposed by Dvorkin and Toscano (2001) in the scope \n\nof finite elements, by the way, will be tested through the practical numerical simulations of the \n\npresent work.  \n\nThe influence of the isolated imperfections existing on the ground and of the soil \n\nfriction coefficients in the buckling of pipelines is widely discussed in literature, as presented, \n\nbut not using internal pressure loads. The present work, additionally, also intends to perform a \n\nrelative study about the influence of these two parameters. Such study is benefited by the use \n\nof geometrically-exact 3D Timoshenko beam elements to represent the pipeline, especially with \n\nrespect to the post-buckling configurations of the pipeline, since large displacements and finite \n\nrotations are possible. Contact models also contribute to enhance the numerical results. The \n\nsuitable prediction of post-buckling configurations can be important, for example, to study \n\npossible failure modes resulting from the buckling of pipelines. \n\nThrough the scenario described, it is possible to infer that the objectives of the \n\npresent work are valid and will contribute to the knowledge in the area. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n82 \n\n \n\n3 STABILITY OF STRUCTURES \n\n \n\nAs detailed in Section 2, once determined the internal pressure or the equivalent \n\naxial force acting on the pipeline, it is necessary to know if the pipeline buckles when subjected \n\nto these loads. Moreover, if the pipe buckles, it is necessary to know what is the magnitude of \n\nits displacements after the buckling. Clearly, this scenario consists in a stability problem, \n\nbecause the focus is on the load for which the pipeline loses the stability of its initial \n\nconfiguration and tries to find another stable configuration. For this reason, some aspects of \n\nstability of structures will be presented in this section. The intention, however, is not to discuss \n\nstability of structures deeply, but to discuss simple ideas that will be the basis of comparison \n\nbetween analytical and numerical solutions in Section 5. Basically, the present work is \n\nconcerned with critical loads and post-buckling configurations. \n\nBefore discussing the topics of structural stability that are of interest to the \n\npresent work, it is appropriate to briefly present the historical development of the basic stability \n\ntheory. Such historical development is presented below, being based on Thompson (1982) and \n\nGodoy (1999). \n\nAlthough there are indications that, for example, the Greeks, between 400 b. C. \n\nand 200 b. C., carried out investigations on stability of structures, the first significant theoretical \n\nstudies in the area began to arise only in the seventeenth century. In 1686, Isaac Newton (1642-\n\n1727) detailed experimental studies of the motions of a simple pendulum in both air and water. \n\nThis system, with damped oscillations, is an example of an asymptotically stable system. James \n\nBernoulli (1654-1705) and Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782), in their turn, may have induced \n\nLeonard Euler (1707-1783) to study structural stability. This is because, James Bernoulli \n\nstudied the deflection of an elastic rod in bending, concluding that its resistance was provided \n\nby the extension and the contraction of the longitudinal fibers and that there was a relationship \n\nbetween the bending moment and the curvature of the deflected rod. Although James Bernoulli \n\nand Daniel Bernoulli did not work with stability, the last one suggested to Leonard Euler to \n\ndevelop the differential equation of the rod. And it was in this process that, in addition to \n\nobtaining such differential equation, Leonard Euler, in 1744, with the aid of the variational \n\ncalculus, determined the equilibrium configurations of a compressed elastic column. The study \n\nof Leonard Euler is considered the first to deal with a bifurcation problem. However, his study \n\ndid not have practical application for a century, because stability was not a problem for the rock \n\nand timber structures built at that time. Lagrange (1736-1813) also addressed stability of \n\nstructures, developing the analytical energy approach to mechanics, which generated the \n\n\n\n83 \n\n \n\nfundamental energy theorem that proposes that a minimum of the total potential energy is a \n\nsufficient condition for stability. The general bifurcation theory arose, then, in the nineteenth \n\ncentury, being developed by Henri Poincar\u00e9 (1854-1912), who also created the global \n\nqualitative dynamics in which there is also much of stability theory. Lyapunov (1857-1918), in \n\nhis turn, presented, in 1892, a rigorous mathematical definition for stability, besides introducing \n\nhis generalized energy functions. \n\nAccording to Thompson (1982), with the advance of science and applied \n\nmechanics, the original classical development of stability has been fragmented and diversified, \n\nnot being restricted to elastic stability theory. The most recent researches in the area use, among \n\nothers, theoretical, experimental, computational and behavioral approaches to study, for \n\nexample, both critical loads and post-buckling configurations. The subject is quite broad, but \n\nas already commented, the present work will not present it deeply, since only some basic aspects \n\nof elastic stability will be necessary herein. Once contextualized the stability of structures, such \n\nbasic aspects will be useful to understand the discussions proposed in Section 5. \n\nBased on the general concept of stability, a nonperturbed solution of a structure \n\n(equilibrium or movement) is stable if the distances between it and perturbed solutions remain \n\nwithin the established limits for all time and perturbation. Many stability definitions come from \n\nsuch concept and may be used to quantify the stability. Although this concept is in a dynamic \n\ncontext, the existing methods for analyzing stability problems are not restricted to dynamic \n\nmethods. Ziegler (1968), for instance, discusses four methods to deal with such problems. The \n\nfirst method is called imperfection method and consists in analyzing the behavior of imperfect \n\nstructures. The main idea of this method is to determine the load for which the static \n\ndisplacements become excessive or infinite (in the linear case). The equilibrium method, the \n\nsecond of the four methods discussed by Ziegler (1968), consists in analyzing the equilibrium \n\nof perfect structures. When the trivial equilibrium position loses its stability, a nontrivial \n\nequilibrium position appears. With this in mind, the equilibrium method looks for the loads for \n\nwhich such perfect structures admit nontrivial equilibrium configurations. The third method, in \n\nits turn, is based on the potential energy of the system and originated from Lagrange\u2019s studies. \n\nThe transition from stability to instability may occur when the potential energy ceases to be \n\npositive definite (or ceases to be a point of minimum). According to Bazant and Cedolin (2010), \n\nthe second method represents a part of the third method, however, the second method does not \n\nanswer the question of stability: it gives only equilibrium states, which may be stable or not. It \n\nis also worth mentioning that all previous methods have the objective of analyzing a static \n\nnature for the structure base-state. The last method presented by Ziegler (1968), however, is \n\n\n\n84 \n\n \n\nkinetic and meets the stability concept presented. The called vibration method establishes that, \n\nin stable systems, small perturbations result in bounded motions in the vicinity of the \n\nequilibrium position. Thus, the idea of this method is to find the load for which such motions \n\nbecome unbounded (here one may also interpret such criterion by Lyapunov\u2019s point of view). \n\nZiegler (1968) also shows that both static and dynamic methods provide the \n\nsame critical loads for the Euler\u2019s column buckling problems. However, this conclusion cannot \n\nbe generalized for all systems. A question that arises is when the static and dynamic methods \n\nshould be used. Besides Ziegler (1968), Thompson (1982), Bazant and Cedolin (2010) and Gay \n\nNeto and Martins (2013) also address the question. To understand the topic, it is fundamental \n\nto list what types of force can be present in a physical system. In general, the forces can be \n\ndivided into active forces (loads) and reactive forces (reactions). The reactions, in systems \n\nwhose constraints do not depend explicitly on time, can be either nonworking or dissipative. \n\nThe loads, in their turn, can be divided into non-stationary loads, which vary over time, and \n\nstationary loads, which do not vary over time. The stationary loads can be subdivided into loads \n\nthat depend on velocity and loads that depend on displacement. The loads that depend on \n\nvelocity correspond to dissipative, gyroscopic and impressive loads. Dissipative loads do \n\nnegative work on the system, gyroscopic loads do not do work on the system and impressive \n\nloads do positive work on the system. The loads which depend on displacement, in their turn, \n\ncorrespond to non-circulatory loads (elastic and conservative loads) and circulatory loads. \n\nBesides the loads that depend on velocity and on displacement, it is also possible to identify the \n\ninertial effects (resulting from mathematical manipulations given by the D\u2019Alembert\u2019s principle \n\nand depending on acceleration) and the nonlinearities that can depend on acceleration, velocity \n\nand displacement.  \n\nBased on such classification of forces and on the works cited previously, it is \n\npossible to classify the systems and to outline the situations in which static and dynamic \n\nanalyses are valid. Systems with non-stationary loads have to be analyzed by dynamic methods. \n\nWith relation to stationary systems, first of all, it is important to mention that all of them are \n\nassumed to have inertial effects and dissipative and elastic loads. Therefore, in conservative \n\nsystems, besides the previous loads, there are only conservative loads. In gyroscopic systems, \n\nthere are, besides conservative loads, gyroscopic loads. Impressive systems, in their turn, can \n\nhave impressive and conservative loads. Circulatory systems can have conservative and \n\ncirculatory loads and, finally, gyroscopic circulatory systems can have gyroscopic, conservative \n\nand circulatory loads. Table 3 shows the classification of physical systems.  \n\n\n\n85 \n\n \n\nTable 3 \u2013 Classification of physical systems. \n\nLoads/ \n\nSystems \n\nDependent on velocity \nDependent on \n\ndisplacement \nExamples \n\nCan \n\nstatic \n\nanalysis \n\nbe \n\nused? \nGyroscopic Impressive Conservative Circulatory \n\nConservative   X  \nBuckling \n\nof Euler's \n\ncolumns \n\nYes \n\nGyroscopic X  X  \nDivergence \n\nof a pin-\n\nended pipe \n\nYes \n\nImpressive  X X  \nGalloping \n\nof a bluff \n\nstructure \n\nNo \n\nCirculatory   X X \n\nFlutter of \n\nan aircraft \n\npanel \n\nNo \n\nGyroscopic \n\ncirculatory \nX  X X \n\nFlutter of a \n\ncantilever \n\npipe \n\nNo \n\nNote: all systems are assumed to have inertial, dissipative and elastic forces. \n\nSource: adapted from Thompson (1982). \n\n \n\nIt is possible to say that conservative and gyroscopic systems can be analyzed \n\nby both static and dynamic methods and that impressive, circulatory and gyroscopic circulatory \n\nsystems cannot be analyzed by static methods. Bazant and Cedolin (2010) state that the dynamic \n\nanalysis consists in the fundamental test of stability, but the static analysis can bring useful \n\nsimplifications when it can be used. \n\nTo illustrate the aforementioned discussions, two examples, based on Ziegler \n\n(1968), are discussed in this section (Figure 31). They consist in prismatic cantilever columns \n\nwith flexural rigidity EI and elastic-linear material behavior. There is also an assumption of \n\nsmall strains and small deflections. The first example has a non-follower load P at the free end \n\nand will be discussed by equilibrium method. The second example has a follower load P at the \n\nfree end and will be discussed by equilibrium and vibration methods. As considered in the \n\nprevious section, the notation (\u2026)\u2019 stands for the derivative with respect to coordinate x. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n86 \n\n \n\nFigure 31 \u2013 Cantilever columns with non-follower and follower loads.  \n\n  \n\nSource: adapted from Ziegler (1968). \n\n \n\nStarting by the first example and assuming that the eccentricity e is zero, since \nthe equilibrium method deals with perfect systems, the linearized equation of the deflection \n\ncurve v and the boundary conditions, with f being the deflection at the free end x = l, are given \nby Eq.

Of course, it is an unexpected (and \n\nnon-coherent) result. It occurs because the system analyzed is neither conservative nor \n\ngyroscopic. It is a circulatory system in which the direction of the force depends on the column \n\ndeflection. The column cannot be analyzed by static methods, thus the vibration method has to \n\nbe used.  \n\n\n\n88 \n\n \n\nAccording to Ziegler (1968), in the kinetic approach, the flexural oscillations of \n\nthe column are investigated.

The \n\nSection 5, however, will present numerical examples of pipelines using software Giraffe, which \n\nperforms analyses with geometrical nonlinearities, and the results will be compared. \n\nConcerning more complex structures, beyond columns, they can be discretized \n\nwith n degrees of freedom to be analyzed. With such discretization, the Lyapunov\u2019s first method \ncan also be used to study the kinetic stability of structures, determining when the structure loses \n\nthe stability and which is the instability type, for example, divergence or flutter. The idea of the \n\nLyapunov\u2019s first method coincides with that presented for the vibration method: the structure \n\nloses stability when small perturbations result in unbounded motions in the vicinity of the \n\nequilibrium position. It is the general concept of stability and the Lyapunov\u2019s first method is a \n\nway to quantify such concept.  \n\nThe differential equations of motion for a system with n degrees of freedom are \ngiven by Eq. (131) in which t is the mass matrix, P is the damping matrix, k is the stiffness \nmatrix, ? is the vector of displacements, ??  is the vector of velocities, ??  is the vector of \naccelerations and Z is the vector of applied forces. \n\n t?? + P?? +  k? = Z (131) \n \n\nFor a system without damping and under free vibrations, the differential \n\nequations of motion can be simplified, being given by Eq. (132). \n\n \n\n\n\n90 \n\n t?? + k? = J (132) \n \n\nIt is also possible to transform the second order differential equations of motion \n\ninto first order differential equations. For this, it is necessary to introduce the new variables ?\" \nand ?6. The variable ?\" is equal to ? and ?6 is the first derivative of  ?\" with respect to time \n(??\"). It results in Eq. (133), in which ??6 is the first derivative of  ?6 with respect to time. For a \nsystem without damping and under free vibrations, Eq. (134) can be used. \n\n t??6 + P?6 +  k?\" = Z              ?6 = ??\" (133) \n t??6 +  k?\" = J                          ?6 = ??\" (134) \n \n\nIn the present work, only the second order differential equations of motion will \n\nbe considered. So, the form of the solution of Eq. (132) can be given by Eq. (135), in which ??: \nis the mode of the structure, t is the time, ? is the circulatory frequency and i is the imaginary \nnumber. \n\n ? = e?\u00d4???:  \n \n\n(135) \n\nSubstituting Eq. (135) and its second derivative with respect to time into the Eq. \n\n(132), it results in Eq. (136), which represents an eigenvalue problem with ? = ?6 being the \neigenvalue. \n\n t\u00c0\"k??: = ?6??: (136) \n \n\nTherefore, to study the stability of structures and to apply the Lyapunov\u2019s first \n\nmethod, it is necessary to evaluate and analyze the eigenvalues ? during the loading process. \nBased on Bazant and Cedolin (2010), in a simplified form, when a real positive value of ? \ndecreases, reaches the zero and becomes negative, the instability is characterized by divergence, \n\nsince the exponent of Eq. (135) becomes real, generating unbounded, but not oscillatory, \n\nmotions. When two real positive neighboring values of ? become equal and imaginary values \nof ? arise, the instability is characterized by crescent oscillations, which is called flutter. \n\nWith the previous rules, the Lyapunov\u2019s first method will also be useful in \n\nSection 5. \n\n\n\n91 \n\n \n\n4 CONTACT MODELS \n\n \n\nThe onshore and offshore pipelines used to transport oil and gas from the \n\nwellheads are laid on the ground. So, the soil-pipeline interaction plays a fundamental role in \n\nthe analysis of pipelines under operation. Such interaction can be simulated by means of contact \n\nmodels. So, since the buckling of pipelines is a phenomenon that has to consider the soil-\n\npipeline interaction, it is important to present some considerations about contact models in the \n\npresent work. The objective of this section is to describe the contact problem and the basic \n\nmethodologies to obtain its solutions, present some lines of research that have been developed \n\nin the area and present the formulation used to perform the numerical simulations described in \n\nSection 5. \n\n \n\n4.1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTACT PROBLEM \n\n \n\nThe contact mechanics is quite complex and a good way to understand its \n\ncharacteristics and methodologies is to consider a very simple example extracted from Wriggers \n\n(2006), in which a point with mass m is supported by a linear spring with stiffness k. The \ndisplacement u of the point mass can be restricted by a rigid plane that is at a distance h from \nit (Figure 32). It is worth highlighting that however simple the practical problem may be \u2013 even \n\nfor elastic-linear problems with small strains in the context of continuum mechanics \u2013 the \n\ncontact problem will always be nonlinear. \n\n \n\nFigure 32 \u2013 Point mass supported by spring. \n\n \n\nSource: Wriggers (2006). \n\n \n\nThe energy ? of the system presented in Figure 32 can be written as a function \nof the displacement u of the point mass, as shown in Eq. (137). \n\n\n\n92 \n\n ? = 12 ku6 ? mgu (137) \n \n\nIn order not to allow penetrations of the point mass into the rigid plane, a \n\nrestriction to its movement has to be imposed by the inequality shown in Eq. (138), which \nestablishes that or there is a gap between the point mass and the rigid plane or such gap is \n\nclosed. This is the general idea of contact models: imposition of constraints to avoid \n\npenetrations of a body inside another.  \n\n c = h ? u ? 0 (138) \n \n\nIf there was no restriction to the displacement u, the energy would have a \nminimum value ?:?? at u =  mg k? , computed through the variation given by Eq. (139). \nHowever, due to Eq. (138), the solution of Eq. (137) is not at the minimum point associated \n\nwith ?:??, but at the minimum point associated with ?:??? , which is the minimum energy within \nthe admissible solution space. See Figure 33, extracted from Wriggers (2006), for a better \n\nunderstanding.  \n\n ?? = ku?u ? mg?u = 0 (139) \n \n\nFigure 33 \u2013 Energy of the mass spring system. \n\n  \n\nSource: Wriggers (2006). \n\n \n\nBy variation of Eq. (138), one can restrict the virtual displacement ?u at the \ncontact constraint, obtaining Eq. (140), which states that ?u can only point in the upward \ndirection. \n\n \n\n\n\n93 \n\n ?u ? 0 (140) \n \n\nSince mg is larger than ku in the case of contact, and using Eq. (140) in Eq. \n(139), it yields to the variational inequality given by Eq. (141). \n\n ku?u ? mg?u ? 0 (141) \n \n\nOnce the contact between the point mass and the rigid plane is established, a \n\nreaction force R? arises and has to obey the restriction given by Eq. (142) in order to indicate \nonly compressive states or inactive reaction forces.  \n\n R? ? 0 (142) \n \n\nThe nonlinearity of the contact problem is in the fact that there are two possible \n\nsituations that generate a load-displacement curve that has non-differentiable points. The first \n\nsituation is that in which the spring stiffness is large enough not to allow contact between the \n\npoint mass and the rigid plane. This is represented by the conditions given by Eq. (143). The \n\nsecond situation is that in which there is contact between the point mass and the rigid plane and \n\nit is represented by the conditions given by Eq. (144). Eq. (143) and Eq. (144) can be combined \n\nin the statement given by Eq. (145), which are known as Hertz\u2013Signorini\u2013Moreau conditions \n\nin contact mechanics.  \n\n R? = 0 and c > 0 (143) \n R? &lt;0 and c =  0 (144) \n R? ? 0, c ?  0 and R?c = 0 (145) \n \n\nIt is also possible to include friction in the contact between the point mass and \n\nthe rigid plane. For that, consider the system illustrated in Figure 34, in which the point mass \n\nis in contact with the rigid plane (R? ? 0) and there is a force F, tangential to the plane. ? is \nthe friction coefficient.  \n\n \n\n\n\n94 \n\n \n\nFigure 34 \u2013 Mass spring system under tangential load. \n\n  \n\nSource: Wriggers (2006). \n\n \n\nAssuming static equilibrium, the vertical and horizontal equilibrium equations \n\nare given by Eq. (146) and Eq. (147), respectively, in which R, is the tangential reaction force. \n R? + mg ? kh = 0 (146) \n R, = F, (147) \n \n\nThere are several constitutive relations to represent the friction between the point \n\nmass and the rigid plane. The simplest constitutive relation is the Coulomb\u2019s law, illustrated in \n\nFigure 35. It establishes two states: the stick state and the sliding state. The stick state is \n\ncharacterized by no relative tangential movement between the point mass and the plane. In the \n\nsliding state, on the other hand, there is a relative displacement u, between them.  \n \n\nFigure 35 \u2013 Coulomb\u2019s law. \n\n  \n\nSource: Wriggers (2006). \n\n \n\nThe Coulomb\u2019s law provides the inequality given by Eq. (148), which depends \n\non the normal and tangential reaction forces. The stick state is given by Eq. (149) and the sliding \n\n\n\n95 \n\n \n\nstate is given by Eq. (150). Again, the conditions can be combined in only one statement, given \n\nby Eq. (151). \n\n f3R?, R,5 = |R,| +  ?R? ? 0 (148) \n |R,| &lt;? ?R? and u, = 0 (149) \n |R,| = ? ?R? and u, ? 0 (150) \n |u,| ?  0 , f ? 0 and |u,|f = 0 (151) \n \n\nBoth normal and tangential inequalities cannot be applied directly to solve the \n\ncontact problem and special methods have to be used to obtain its solution, such as the Lagrange \n\nmultiplier method and the penalty method. Using the normal contact between the point mass \n\nand the rigid plane as example, these two methods are explained below.  \n\nThe idea of the Lagrange multiplier method is to assume that the constraint to \n\nthe displacement of the point mass is active, that is, the conditions given by Eq. (144) are \n\nsatisfied. So, this method adds a term related to the constraint to the energy of the system, \n\ngenerating Eq. (152), in which ? is the Lagrange multiplier. From Eq. (145), it is possible to \ndeduce that the Lagrange multiplier is equivalent to the reaction force R?. \n\n \n\n? = 12 ku6 ? mgu + ?c (152) \n \n\nThe variation of Eq. (152) with respect to u and ? leads to Eq. (153) and Eq. \n(154), respectively. The first expression represents the equilibrium of the point mass, which \n\nincludes the reaction force that appears due to its contact with the rigid plane. The second \n\nexpression, in its turn, states that Eq. (138) is satisfied with u = h. \n ku?u ? mg?u ? ??u = 0 (153) \n c?? = 0 (154) \n \n\nThe variation is no longer restricted and it is possible to find ? or R? through Eq. \n\n\n\n96 \n\n \n\n(155). Eq. (142) also has to be checked in order to discard possible adhesion cases. If the \n\ncondition is not satisfied, it means that the constraint is inactive and, hence, ? is zero and the \ncorrect solution for the problem is that corresponding to ?:??. \n\n ? =  kh ? mg (155) \n \n\nWith respect to the penalty method, unlike the Lagrange multiplier method, for \n\nan active constraint, it introduces a penalty term into Eq. (137), as shown in Eq. (156). The \n\nstructure of the penalty term is the same as the potential energy of a spring. So, the normal \n\npenalty parameter ?? can be understood as a spring stiffness in the contact between the point \nmass and the rigid plane. \n\n \n\n? = 12 ku6 ? mgu + 12 ??c6      ?? > 0 (156) \n \n\nThe variation of Eq. (156) yields to Eq. (157). Using Eq. (138), the solution of \n\nEq. (157) can be given by Eq. (158) and the constraint equation c, in its turn, can be given by \nEq. (159). \n\n ku?u ? mg?u ? ??c?u = 0 (157) \n \n\nu =  mg + ??hk + ??  (158) \n \n\nc =  kh ? mgk + ??  (159) \n \n\nSince mg ? kh when the contact is present, it is possible to say that Eq. (159) \ngives the penetration of the point mass into the rigid plane, that is, the compression of the spring \n\nthat represents the contact. Such penetration depends on the spring stiffness. So, to impose the \n\nconstraint given by Eq. (138), ?? has to tend to infinite.  Again, it is possible to distinguish two \nlimiting situations. In the first limiting situation, as mentioned, ?? tends to infinite and, \ntherefore, the penetration is very small, which is coherent for active constraints. In the second \n\nlimiting situation, ?? tends to zero, being only valid for inactive constraints. So, a small penalty \n\n\n\n97 \n\n \n\nparameter for active constraints implies in large penetration into the plane.  \n\nTo finalize, the reaction force R? can be found using Eq. (160), which comes \nfrom Eq. (157). It is possible to see that for values of ?? tending to infinite, Eq. (160) approaches \nto that obtained using the Lagrange multiplier method. \n\n \n\nR? =  ??c =  ?? kh ? mgk + ??  (160) \n \n\nAccording to Wriggers (2006) both methods have advantages and disadvantages. \n\nThe Lagrange multiplier method, for example, fulfills the constraint equation exactly, but \n\nrequires additional variables. The penalty method, on the other hand, does not require additional \n\nvariables, but implies in non-physical penetrations. For the simple example presented, the use \n\nof one or another method does not make so much difference. But, for more complex situations, \n\nit does. So, the choice of the best method to be used depends on the application and on the \n\ncontact model employed.  \n\nIt is important to emphasize that the previous examples were important to show \n\nthe general characteristics of the contact problems. The same ideas can be applied, though not \n\nso easily, to more practical problems, which involve the continuum mechanics and more \n\ncomplex constitutive relations for the contact bodies. For that, one can obtain, using virtual \n\ndisplacements, the weak form of the problem and the variational inequality due to possible \n\ncontacts. The best strategy to model the contact and obtain the solution, again, depends on the \n\nspecific situation, and there is no consensus on which procedure is the best, as it will be \n\ncommented in Section 4.2. \n\n \n\n4.2 BRIEF EXPOSITION OF THE LINES OF RESEARCH ON CONTACT MECHANICS  \n\n \n\nAs mentioned, the example of Section 4.1, although simple, provides the basic \n\ncharacteristics of contact mechanics. Obviously, the real contact problems are more complex, \n\nnot involving only point masses, but complex geometries, which can require, for example, a in-\n\ndepth knowledge of continuum mechanics. And the difficulties in dealing with contact \n\nproblems, which are essentially nonlinear, are not only related to geometry and its implications. \n\nAlthough, in some cases, it is possible to consider linear elasticity with small strains, as, for \n\nexample, in the design of bearings and gears, in many other cases, there is a need to consider \n\nthat the contact bodies undergo large displacements and finite rotations and that their \n\n\n\n98 \n\n \n\nconstitutive equations are inelastic, as for example, in car impact simulations. The dynamic \n\neffects and the consideration of multiple contact surfaces including self-contact are other \n\nobstacles in the analysis of contact problems (WRIGGERS, 2006). Due to the complexity of \n\ncontact problems, for most applications, computational numerical methods have been employed \n\nto study them. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that even the more modern technologies \n\ncannot encompass all contact problems, making the contact mechanics an area with several \n\npossible lines of research. It is possible to say that there is still no best contact model to be used \n\nin practice for all kind of bodies. \n\nAccording to Wriggers (2006), it is possible to distinguish some areas in \n\ncomputational contact mechanics, which analyze different contact problems. One of them is the \n\nfinite element method (FEM), which can be applied both for problems with small and large \n\ndeformations and both for problems in the elastic and inelastic range. There are also discrete \n\nelement methods (DEM) that are used to study contact problems in which particles come into \n\ncontact. Multibody systems have also been used to study small systems in which it is possible \n\nto describe the bodies as if they were rigid.  \n\nConcerning the FEM, tool used by the present work to perform the numerical \n\nsimulations of the pipeline, it is possible to appoint some techniques for modelling contact \n\nproblems. According to Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2016), such techniques can be \n\ngrouped into: node to node formulations, node to surface formulations, surface to surface \n\nformulations and contact involving beam elements. The node to node formulations, as the name \n\nsuggests, establish the contact between nodes. The basis of these formulations can be found in \n\nthe works of Francavilla and Zienkiewicz (1975) and Stadter and Weiss (1979). A gap function \n\nthat measures the distance between the nodes is defined. This function plays the same role of \n\nthe Eq. (138) shown in the previous section. If the penetration is detected, the terms related to \n\nthe contact between the nodes can be included in the weak form of the model. The limitation of \n\nthe node to node formulations is that the nodes that are candidates to come into contact have to \n\nbe pre-established. If these nodes change during the simulation, especially in problems with \n\nlarge deformations, such change will not be captured by the formulations.  \n\nWith respect to the node to surface formulations, they define a slave point and a \n\nmaster surface, assuming a pointwise contact. The point of contact in the master surface can be \n\nfound by a minimum distance optimization problem, being possible to change the point of \n\ncontact in problems with large deformations. According to Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers \n\n(2016), the limitation of the node to surface formulations is the necessity of solving several \n\ncontact problems, one for each slave point used to represent the surface that was not chosen as \n\n\n\n99 \n\n \n\nmaster.  The master surface, in its turn, has to be \u201c[\u2026] parameterized using convective \n\ncoordinates, related to material points on the surface, where contact may take place [\u2026]\u201d (GAY \n\nNETO; PIMENTA; WRIGGERS, 2017, p. 2). The works of Bathe and Chaudhary (1985) and \n\nBandeira, Wriggers and Pimenta (2003) can be cited in the context of node to surface \n\nformulations.  \n\nUnlike the node to surface formulations, which impose the contact constraint \n\ndirectly in points, the surface to surface formulations impose the constraint in the weak form \n\nthrough, for example, Lagrange multipliers, being more elaborated than the previous. The weak \n\nform is then integrated on the contact interface area. The inclusion of the contact constraint in \n\nthe weak form is made after the verification of minimum distances between the integration \n\npoints of a surface and another. In this context, the Mortar method can be mentioned as an \n\ninteresting alternative to enforce the contact condition in a weak sense. Puso (2003) and Fischer \n\nand Wriggers (2005) are examples of researchers that deal with surface to surface formulations. \n\nFinally, there are specific formulations to address the contact between beam \n\nelements. The following works deal with the topic: Wriggers and Zavarise (1997) describe a \n\nfrictionless pointwise contact between circular beams without master-slave distinctions; \n\nZavarise and Wriggers (2000) generalize the previous for frictional pointwise contacts; Gay \n\nNeto, Martins and Pimenta (2013) and Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2014), in their turn, \n\napply the beam to beam formulation in self-contact scenarios with large twisting. \n\nThe contact model used by the present work to perform the numerical \n\nsimulations of the pipeline is described in Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2013) and Gay \n\nNeto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2017), consisting in a node to surface formulation. The first \n\nreference deals specifically with the contact between spheres and rigid and flat surfaces and the \n\nsecond generalizes the previous for any nature of surfaces, which is important to simulate the \n\ncontact between the pipeline and the soil imperfections. The next section presents the main \n\nideas of such contact model. For the detailed formulation, Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers \n\n(2017) can be consulted. \n\n \n\n4.3 CONTACT MODEL USED IN NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS \n\n \n\nThe contact model proposed by Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2013) and \n\nGay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2017), in the context of finite elements, uses a particular \n\nnode-surface description, in which nodes are the center of spherical surfaces, whose kinematics \n\nallows to obtain the normal and tangential gaps. Figure 36 presents the geometrical description \n\n\n\n100 \n\n \n\nof the contact model. As proposed by Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2017), the upper-right \n\nindex i refers to a configuration obtained previously. For next configurations to be obtained, \nthe upper-right index i + 1 is used. The upper-right index ?, in its turn, indicates quantities that \nrelate the configurations i and i + 1. The lower-right index refers to the material point to which \na certain quantify is referred. For example, %??   refers to the position vector of the material point S at configuration i. The global coordinate system is (O,W\", W6,WI). \n\n \n\nFigure 36 \u2013 Geometrical description of the contact model. \n\n  \n\nSource: Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2017). \n\n \n\nFrom Figure 36, the spherical surface with center S is called slave. This can come \ninto contact with another general surface ?, called master. For the present work, for example, \nthe centers of the spherical surfaces are rigidly attached to the nodes of the beam finite elements \n\nused to discretize the pipeline and the radii r of these spherical surfaces are equal to the external \nradius of the pipeline cross section.        \n\nTo describe the spherical surface at a certain configuration i, it is necessary to \nfind the position of its center %??  and the orientation of the surface, given by the rotation tensor |?, which is associated with the rotation vector ???  of the center of the spherical surface. |? \ncan be evaluated using Rodrigues\u2019 rotation parameters. More details can be found in Gay Neto, \n\nPimenta and Wriggers (2017).  \n\nSix degrees of freedom are necessary to describe the evolution of the spherical \n\nsurface between configurations i and i + 1. They are represented by the vector Q?\t given by Eq. \n(161), in which ??\t is the vector of displacements of S between configurations i and i + 1 and ??\t is the vector that represents the rotations of S between configurations i and i + 1. \n\n\n\n101 \n\n \n\nQ?\t = \u00b1??\t??\t\u00b2 (161) \n \n\nThe master surface ?, which is candidate to come into contact with the spherical \nsurface, is parameterized using the convective coordinates ? and ?. Such coordinates can be \nrepresented by the vector N =  ?? ??,. The master surface is also dependent on a N-dimensional \nvector QS that contains N values of generalized coordinates, which correspond to the degrees \nof freedom necessary to describe the movement of the master surface in space. Eq. (162) gives \n\nthe parameters on which the master surface is dependent. \n\n ? = ?\u00dd3N, QS5 (162) \n \n\nIn order to encompass all degrees of freedom that may affect the interaction \n\nbetween the slave and master surfaces, Eq. (161) can be complemented, generating Q =\n\u00d8Q?, QS, \u00d9,. \n\nFor a specific set of degrees of freedom Q,? it is possible to seek for the \ncorresponding convective coordinates N? associated with the minimum distance between S and ?. Considering that the master surface is smooth, the tangent directions  ?? and ?? can always \nbe defined and the minimum distance can be found by the orthogonality relations shown in Eq. \n\n(163).   \n\n \n\n~ =  \u00cc?? ? 3%? ? ?5 = 0?? ? 3%? ? ?5 = 0 (163) \n \n\nIn order to find N? = ?? \u00df ?1 ?,, Eq. (163) can be solved using the Newton-Raphson \nmethod, which is detailed in Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2017). Once found the \n\nconvective coordinates that provide the minimum distance between S and ?, the contact normal \ndirection # can be found by Eq. (164). The normal gap function  ? given by Eq. (165), in the \nvector form, can be tested along time-evolution in order to detect penetrations of the slave \n\nsurface into the master surface. It is also possible to define a scalar quantify g? to measure the \ngap, which is given by Eq. (166). \n\n \n\n\n\n102 \n\n \n\n# =  \u00ca ??  \u00d7  ??\u00e1??  \u00d7  ??\u00e1\u00cbN? (164) \n  ? = 3%? ? ?5 ? r# (165) \n g? = 3%? ? ?5 ? # ? r (166) \n \n\nIn the model proposed by Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2017), the contact \n\ninequalities are enforced by the penalty method. So, in case of penetration, the constraint is \n\nincluded in the weak form of the model. Based on Section 4.1, it is possible to define the \n\npotential energy ? through Eq. (167). It leads to the weak form contribution ??? due to normal \ncontact, given by Eq. (168). \n\n \n\n? = 12 ?? ? ?  ? (167) \n ??? = ?? ? ? ? ? (168) \n \n\nThe variation of Eq. (165) leads to Eq. (169). \n\n ? ? = 3?%? ? ??5 ? r?# (169) \n \n\nFrom the previous expressions, Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2017) develop \n\nmathematically the terms due to normal contact to be included in the whole system\u2019s weak \n\nform, for nonlinear models. In this context, the authors also develop the expression for the \n\ntangent operator. The final expressions can be included in a nonlinear finite element solver to \n\nfind the nonlinear solution of the problem. \n\nOnce the normal contact between the slave and master surfaces is established, \n\nthe contact model is also able to evaluate the tangential contact effects. For that, the tangential \n\ngap function is determined from the kinematics description of the slave and master surfaces. \n\nThe kinematics description is illustrated in Figure 37. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n103 \n\n \n\nFigure 37 \u2013 Kinematics description used to define the tangential gap function. \n\n  \n\nSource: Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2017). \n\n \n\nFrom Figure 37, it is possible to see two configurations of the system composed \n\nby the slave surface and the master surface. The first configuration i corresponds to the \nbeginning of the contact between the two bodies, in which there is a pointwise contact at  ??N?, Q??. As already presented, N? stands for values of convective coordinates and Q? stands for \nthe degrees of freedom of the system, both at configuration i. On the spherical surface, such \npointwise contact may be located by the position vector ~?, with origin at the center S of the \nspherical surface. The contact normal direction, in its turn, is given by the vector #?.  \n\nWhen the configuration changes from i to i + 1, the tendency of sliding can be \nquantified by a vector that connects the current and previous material points where the contact \n\nbetween the slave surface and the master surface is established. These points can be obtained \n\nby the projection of S on the master surface. With respect to the master surface, the material \npoint at ??N?, Q?? in the configuration i becomes ??N?, Q?!\"? in the new configuration i + 1. It \nis clear that the convective coordinates of the previous contact point does not change because \n\nthe point remains the same, but the degrees of freedom of the system change. When sliding \n\noccurs, the new position of the contact point is given by  ??N?!\", Q?!\"?.  Since the contact point \nchanges, both the convective coordinates and the degrees of freedom of the system change in \n\nthe configuration i + 1.With respect to the spherical surface, the center point S moves ??\t and \nthe vector ~? rotates  |?\t. The vector ??\t represents the local change in the material points where \nthe contact is established on the spherical surface and the vector ?S\t  represents the local change \nin the material points where the contact is established on the master surface.  \n\nBased on the previous discussions, Eq. (170), Eq. (171) and Eq. (172) can be \n\nwritten:  \n\n \n\n\n\n104 \n\n ??\t =  ?~? +  ??\t +  ~?!\" ? \u00d8??N?!\", Q?!\"? ? ??N?, Q?? \u00d9 (170) \n ?S\t =  ??N?, Q?!\"? ? ??N?!\", Q?!\"? (171) \n ??\t ? ?S\t =  ?~? +  ??\t +  ~?!\" + ??N?, Q?? ? ??N?, Q?!\"? (172) \n \n\nThe rotation motion, in its turn, is given by Eq. (173). Besides this, with Eq. \n\n(174), Eq. (175) can be written. \n\n ~?!\" =  |?\t ~? (173) \n ~? =  ?r #? (174) \n ~?!\" ?  ~? =  ?|?\t ? f? ~? = r?f?|?\t? #? (175) \n \n\nSubstituting Eq. (175) into Eq. (172), it yields to Eq. (176). \n\n ??\t ? ?S\t =  r?f?|?\t? #? +  ??\t +  ??N?, Q?? ? ??N?, Q?!\"? (176) \n \n\nThe incremental tangential gap, from configuration i to configuration i + 1, is \ndefined by Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2017) as the difference between ??\t and ?S\t , \nprojected in the contact tangent plane at configuration i + 1. It can be defined mathematically \nby Eq. (177), in which #?!\" is the contact normal direction at configuration i + 1. \n\n  ?\t = ???\t ? ?S\t ? ? ???\t ? ?S\t ? ? #?!\"#?!\" (177) \n \n\nTo propagate the information of the tangential gap of the configuration i to the \nnext configuration i + 1, Eq. (178) can be used. It represents the tendency of sliding for a given \ncontact pair. The rotation operator |? is necessary to update the direction of the accumulated \ntangential gap, from a global perspective, when both slave and master surfaces experience same \n\nrigid body motions. More details about |? can be found in Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers \n(2017) and therein references. \n\n \n\n\n\n105 \n\n  ??!\" =  ?\t + |? ??  (178) \n \n\nThe constitutive relation used by Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2017) to \n\nrepresent the contact tangential behavior is the Coulomb\u2019s law. As shown in Section 4.1, \n\nthrough Coulomb\u2019s law, two states may occur: the stick state and the sliding state. So, it is \n\nnecessary to define the maximum friction force possible to occur in the stick state, which is \n\ngiven by F:<= = ?R?. In the context of the present model, R? can be given by R? = |??g?|. \nOnce determined F:<=, it is necessary to compute the friction force that acts on the interface \nbetween the surfaces indeed and compare it to F:<=, determining which state is valid: the stick \nstate or the sliding state. For that, Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2017) use the tangential \n\npenalty approach, adopting a tangential stiffness ?? for the stick state and, thus, controlling the \namount of sliding.  \n\nUsing the penalty method, the tentative-force F?^_ given by Eq. (179) has to be \nevaluated along the time-evolution. This is the force that is compared to F:<= in order to verify \nif sliding occurs.  \n\n F?^_ = ?? \u00e1 ??!\"\u00e1 (179) \n \n\nIf sliding occurs, the evaluation of its amount ?? and its direction ??!\" becomes \nnecessary. With respect to the amount of sliding, it can be computed by Eq. (180) \n\n \n\nif F?^_ > F:<=    ?? = F?^_ ?  F:<=??  if F?^_ &lt;F:<=    ?? = 0 (180) \n \n\nThe sliding tangential gap  ? ?????\t  is given by Eq. (181) and the direction of \nsliding ??!\" can be obtained by Eq. (182), which uses the current tangential gap direction. \n\n  ? ?????\t  = ????!\" (181) \n \n\n??!\" =  ??!\"\u00e1 ??!\"\u00e1 (182) \n \n\n\n\n106 \n\n \n\nThe weak form contributions due to friction are given by Eq. (183) and Eq. (184), \n\nfor the stick and sliding conditions, respectively. \n\n ??? ????? = ?? ??!\" ? ? ??!\" (183) \n ??? ????? = ????\u00e1 ??!\"\u00e1??!\"? ? ? ??!\" (184) \n \n\nAs it was done for the normal contact, from the previous expressions, Gay Neto, \n\nPimenta and Wriggers (2017) develop the contributions due to tangential contact to be included \n\nin the whole system\u2019s weak form, besides the tangent operator. \n\nWith the contact model proposed by Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2017), it \n\nis also possible to consider contact dissipation effects. They will not be considered in the \n\nsimulations of the pipeline, therefore they will not be described herein. More details are \n\navailable in Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2017). \n\nAs mentioned, the node to surface formulation proposed by Gay Neto, Pimenta \n\nand Wriggers (2017) can be used with any nature of surface. Two types of surface are described \n\nbelow. They are used in the numerical simulations of Section 5. \n\nThe first type of surface corresponds to a triangular rigid surface. In the \n\nsimulations of the pipeline, it is used to represent the flat portion of the ground on which the \n\npipeline is laid. With A, B, C being the vertices of the triangular surface and %?, %? and %? being \nthe position vectors of such vertices, the surface can be parameterized using Eq. (185). \n\n \n\n?3?, ?5 =  \u00c8? 12 3? + ?5    12 31 + ?5    12 31 + ?5\u00c9 \u00e2\n%?%?%? \u00e3 (185) \n\n \n\nThe triangular surface is rigidly attached to a node, called pilot node, which rules \n\nits movement (translation and rotation). To define the triangular surface in the initial \n\nconfiguration is necessary to define the global coordinates of its vertices and of the pilot node. \n\nAnother surface used in the simulations of the pipeline is the oscillatory rigid \n\nsurface, which allows to define wave patterns on a surface, in one or in two directions. It is \n\nemployed to represent the isolated imperfections of the ground.  \n\nThe oscillatory rigid surface can be parameterized using Eq. (186), in which  %* \nis the position vector of the pilot node that describes the surface movement (it is also the origin \n\n\n\n107 \n\n \n\nof the surface herein), | is a rotation matrix that rules the alignment of the surface in space and ?3?, ?5, given by Eq. (187), describes the local geometry of the oscillatory rigid surface. More \ndetails about the rotation matrix can be found in Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2017) and \n\nGay Neto (2017). \n\n \n\n?3?, ?5 =  %* + | \u00e2 ???3?, ?5\u00e3 (186) \n ?3?, ?5 = \n\nA\" sin ?2???\" + ?\"? + A6 sin ?2???6 + ?6? + A\"6 sin ?2???\" + ?\"? sin ?2???6 + ?6? (187) \n \n\nFinally, the parameters A\", A6 and A\"6 are amplitudes, the parameters ?\" and ?6 \nare wave-lengths and the parameters ?\" and ?6 are phases. All these parameters have to be \nadjusted to create the geometry of the imperfection desired. The initial directions of ? and ? and \nthe coordinates of the pilot node also have to be initially defined. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n108 \n\n \n\n5 NUMERICAL ANALYSES \n\n \n\nThe present work aims at analyzing the upheaval buckling of pipelines due to \n\ninternal pressure through computational numerical simulations. For that, software Giraffe was \n\nchosen to perform the simulations.  \n\nThe numerical simulations are divided into two main groups. The first group is \n\ncomposed by geometrically-simple models that do not have the commitment to faithfully \n\nrepresent the practical problems involving buckling of pipelines. The idea is to discuss possible \n\napproaches for applying the internal pressure load in the pipeline, besides discussing the \n\ninfluence of using static or dynamic analysis to obtain the structural response to these loads. \n\nThese are more theoretical discussions than practical ones. So, these simple models only \n\nrepresent the pipeline with pre-established boundary conditions at its ends. The contact between \n\nthe pipeline and the ground is not considered and the imperfections necessary to trigger the \n\nbuckling are applied as concentrated forces. Section 5.2 deals with the first group of numerical \n\nsimulations. \n\nThe second group of numerical simulations, in its turn, besides the pipeline, also \n\nincludes the ground on which the pipeline is laid, considering the contact between them. As a \n\nfirst study, the pipeline is laid on a flat ground and the imperfections are imposed as \n\nconcentrated forces. The idea is to have a model comparable to the model of Taylor and Tran \n\n(1996) in order to verify the one proposed by the present work, having as reference an existing \n\nanalytical model. In the sequence, more sophisticated simulations are performed, using contact \n\nmodels to detect soil imperfections modeled with rigid surfaces. The objective of such \n\nsimulations is to, besides verifying the results obtained from the previous simulations in more \n\npractical cases, analyze the influence of the soil imperfections and the soil friction coefficients \n\nin the critical load and in the post-buckling configuration of the pipeline. Section 5.3 deals with \n\nthe second group of numerical simulations. \n\nBefore describing the particularities and the results obtained by each group, \n\nSection 5.1 presents the data and the characteristics common to all simulations. \n\n  \n\n5.1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS \n\n \n\nThis section presents the general data and assumptions adopted to perform the \n\nnumerical simulations. \n\n \n\n\n\n109 \n\n \n\n5.1.1 Material and geometric data \n\n \n\nThe material and the geometric data of the pipeline are the same in all \n\nsimulations. So, their influence in the buckling of pipelines will not be investigated by the \n\npresent work.  \n\nRegarding the material data, the pipe material is the carbon steel API 5L X80 \n\nspecified by American Petroleum Institute (2012), which has yielding strength equal to 552 \n\nMPa, Young\u2019s modulus equal to 200 GPa and specific mass equal to 7850 kg/m3. It was \n\nassumed that the constitutive equation of the steel follows the Hooke\u2019s law, disregarding any \n\nnonlinear/plasticity effects. \n\nWith respect to the dimensions of the pipeline cross section, they were chosen \n\nin such a way that they were compatible with the values found in real pipelines. In practice, in \n\norder to meet the transport capacity requirement, the initial estimative of the diameter of the \n\npipeline cross section depends on hydraulic analyses. Once this capacity is not an information \n\nreadily available, the present work opted to randomly select a diameter used in practice, \n\nconsidering that it meets the demand required by a generic reservoir. The standard NBR 15280-\n\n1 (BRAZILIAN ASSOCIATION OF TECHNICAL STANDARDS2, 2009) presents nominal \n\ndiameters ranging from 0.0127 m (0.5 inch) to 1.6256 m (64 inches). The nominal diameters of \n\nthe pipelines operated by Transpetro (2017) in Brazil, in its turn, range from 0.0762 m (3 inches) \n\nto 1.1684 m (46 inches). In this context, the external diameter of the pipeline chosen to be \n\nsimulated in this work is 0.65 m, which is aproximately equivalent to the 26-inch nominal \n\ndiameter. The thickness of the pipeline wall, in its turn, can be estimated through the nominal \n\ndiameter of the pipeline, the design internal pressure, the admissible stress of the pipe material \n\nand the installation conditions (BRAZILIAN ASSOCIATION OF TECHNICAL \n\nSTANDARDS, 2009). The minimum thickness required for the 26-inch nominal diameter is \n\n0.00710 m. In order to consider a gap for this value, the thickness of the pipeline was adopted \n\nequal to 0.015 m. This value, by the way, is in the range of thicknesses of the pipelines operated \n\nby Transpetro (2017): 0.0052 m (0.203 inch) to 0.0369 m (1.452 inch). \n\n \n\n5.1.2 Geometry modeling \n\n \n\nThe x-direction of the models corresponds to the pipeline longitudinal axis, the \n\n                                                 \n2 Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Normas T\u00e9cnicas (ABNT) \n\n\n\n110 \n\n \n\ny-direction corresponds to the vertical direction and the z-direction corresponds to the \n\nhorizontal direction transverse to the pipeline longitudinal axis. \n\nConcerning the pipeline, it is modeled as a straight line composed by 3-node \n\nbeam elements. Giraffe employs a geometrically-exact 3D Timoshenko beam theory that allows \n\nthe consideration of large displacements and finite rotations. The most important kinematic \n\nassumption that is made considers that the cross sections are rigid. Details about the formulation \n\nused in static analyses can be found in Gay Neto, Martins and Pimenta (2013). For the details \n\nabout the formulation used in dynamic analyses, in its turn, the references Gay Neto, Pimenta \n\nand Wriggers (2014) and Gay Neto (2016) can be consulted. \n\nWith respect to the boundary conditions, Section 5.2 addresses pipelines with \n\nvery simple supports at their ends (Table 4), without the consideration of the contact between \n\nthem and the ground. Section 5.3, on the other hand, uses the contact model described in Section \n\n4.3 to consider the interaction between the pipeline and the ground (with its imperfection), \n\nmodeled with rigid surfaces. \n\n \n\n5.1.3 Load modeling \n\n \n\nBesides the pipeline self-weight, only the effect of the internal pressure is \n\naddressed in the numerical simulations, as the only triggering for buckling. It is considered two-\n\nway. The first approach consists in the application of equivalent compressive axial forces at the \n\nends of the pipeline that generate the same effect of the internal pressure, that is, that generate \n\nthe same effective axial force. The relation between both is given by Eq. (18). As the present \n\nwork has the objective to analyze only the internal pressure effects in the buckling of pipelines, \n\nthe term p?A? of such equation can be disregarded. Furthermore, 3D Timoshenko beam \nelements are used to represent the pipelines. These beam elements have the assumption that the \n\ncross sections are rigid and the Poisson effect is not considered for the pressure load. Besides \n\nthis, the considered pipelines do not have end caps. Therefore, the term T?T could appear only \ndue to the action of other external loads, such as axial external forces, which would generate \n\nnon-null true wall force in the pipeline. With such assumptions, Eq. (18) can be simplified, \n\ngenerating Eq. (188). Here, a guess of critical compressive force is evaluated by analytical \n\nmodels, and always a larger magnitude of loading is set in numerical models, thus leading not \n\nonly to predict buckling, but also post-buckling behavior. Throughout the numerical \n\nsimulations, such axial forces can be applied with follower and non-follower characteristics, as \n\nit will be shown later. \n\n\n\n111 \n\n Pm = T?T ? p?A?  (188) \n \n\n  The second approach, distinctly, consists in considering the pressure as a force \n\nper unit length Z3?s5 given by the vector expression (GAY NETO; PIMENTA; MARTINS, \n2017) \n\n \n\nZ3?s5 = lim???m dZds = 3???r?6 ?  ???r?65 ?  3???r?6 ?  ???r?65 ? ?3s5?3s5 +  ??r?6p?3a?5 ? ?r?6p?3a?5??3s5#3s5, (189) \n \n\nin which s is the curvilinear abscissa that describes positions along the pipeline length, r? is the \ninternal radius of the pipeline, r? is the external radius of the pipeline,   is the gravitational field \nvector, a3s5 is the vector that describes the centroid of the pipeline cross section at an abscissa \ns, ?3s5 is the curvature at such abscissa and ?3s5 and #3s5 are Frenet tangential and normal \ndirections, respectively, used to describe the pipeline axis spatial curve. The values p?3a?5 and p?3a?5 represent, respectively, external and internal pressurizations. \n\nAs the effect of the external/internal hydrostatic pressure will not be taken into \n\naccount in present numerical models, neither external pressurization, but only the internal \n\npressurization, most of terms of the Eq. (189) can be disregarded, simplifying it to Eq. (190).  \n\n Z3?s5 = ??r?6p?3a?5?3s5#3s5 (190) \n \n\nAnalyzing Eq. (190), one may see that it represents a load in direction #3s5 \u2013 \ncharacterized by the direction connecting each point at abscissa s to its center of curvature \u2013 but \n\npointing to the opposite sense from the center of curvature, consisting, therefore, in a \n\ndestabilizing load, which tries to increase the curvature level. Such directions are updated with \n\nthe deformation of the pipeline under loading, characterizing the follower behavior of the \n\ninternal pressure. Eq. (190) is also curvature-dependent, as it can be noted by the presence of \n\nthe parameter ?3s5, which, again, depends on the pipeline deformation. It is worth mentioning \nthat the formula was derived for Bernoulli-Euler assumptions and the structural model of the \n\npresent work permits first order shear deformations on beams. However, the properties of the \n\npipeline ensure compatibility of formulations, since shear strains are negligible. More in-depth \n\ndiscussions can be found in Gay Neto, Pimenta and Martins (2017). \n\nThe numerical simulations can involve both static and dynamic analyses to \n\n\n\n112 \n\n \n\ninvestigate the pipeline response to internal pressure, as it will be detailed later. Specifically in \n\nrelation to the dynamic analysis, for the cases in which it is used, in order to avoid exciting any \n\nnatural vibration mode of the structure and to represent a quasi-static behavior of the simulation \n\n(prior to instability occurrence), the internal pressure or axial force magnitudes are applied \n\nlinearly from zero, at the initial time, to the time that is approximately twenty times the largest \n\nnatural period of the structure (estimate adopted). The scheme of the application of the dynamic \n\nload can be seen in Figure 38. Damping is not considered and the method used to integrate the \n\nequations of motion over time is the Newmark\u2019s implicit method, with a time step of 0.01 s and \n\nparameters ? and ? equal to 0.3 and 0.5, respectively, chosen to minimize the numerical \ndamping. More details about the implemented version of the Newmark\u2019s method can be found \n\nin Gay Neto (2016). \n\n \n\nFigure 38 \u2013 Scheme of the application of the dynamic load. \n\n  \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nOnce the general aspects of the numerical models have been described, the next \n\nsections deal with their peculiar characteristics, purposes and results.  \n\n \n\n5.2 GEOMETRICALLY-SIMPLE MODELS \n\n \n\nIn this section, pipelines with the boundary conditions shown in Table 4, which \n\nare also illustrated in Figure 39, are simulated using Giraffe. The length of the pipelines is 100 \n\nm and, as commented, the pipelines are represented in the models by a straight line composed \n\nby a set of 3-node beam elements. The pipelines are discretized with 101 equidistant nodes, \n\ntotaling 50 beam elements, and the boundary conditions are imposed at the first and last nodes \n\n\n\n113 \n\n \n\nof the straight line.  \n\n \n\nFigure 39 \u2013 Boundary conditions of the geometrically-simple models. \n\n  \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nIn the first stage of the numerical analysis, pipelines with the first three boundary \n\nconditions shown in Figure 39 are simulated statically. The internal pressure load is applied \n\nthree-way, in different simulations. The first approach, named load type a, consists in the \n\napplication of the internal pressure as the distributed load proposed by Gay Neto, Pimenta and \n\nMartins (2017). For that, it is necessary to specify the value of internal pressure in Giraffe so \n\nthat it performs the distribution of the load along the pipeline. The second approach, named \n\nload type b, consists in the application of a follower compressive axial force at the second end \n\nof the pipeline. The third approach, in its turn, named load type c, consists in the previous axial \n\nforce, but with a non-follower behavior. The relation between the load type a and the load types \n\nb and c is given by Eq. (188). \n\nThe magnitudes of the loads are chosen to be larger than the critical magnitudes \n\nderived in Section 3, with the objective of capturing the buckling phenomenon and the post-\n\nbuckling configuration. Besides this, four different imperfection magnitudes are applied as \n\nconcentrated forces at the pipeline midspan to induce the instability: 100 N, 500 N, 1000 N and \n\n5000 N. These imperfections act in the vertical direction (y-direction) perpendicular to the \n\nelement axis (x-direction), as illustrated in Figure 39.

The difference starts to appear only for the imperfection of 5000 N in both post-\n\nbuckling configurations and equilibrium paths. In the case 2, however, the post-buckling \n\nconfiguration changes with the imperfections. In this case, for instance, the difference between \n\nthe midspan displacements for the imperfections of 1000 N and 5000 N almost reaches the \n\nvalue of 100%. It can also be verified from Figure 43, Figure 45 and Figure 47 the necessity of \n\nnonlinear analyses to determine the correct final shapes of the deflected pipelines, since the \n\ndisplacements and rotations are not small. It is possible to visualize, for instance, the \n\nlongitudinal displacements when these degrees of freedom are free.  \n\nAnalyzing the equilibrium paths (Figure 44, Figure 46 and Figure 48), it is \n\nimportant to say that the horizontal levels that exist when the internal pressure is zero represent \n\nthe deflections caused by the initial imperfections. Also from the equilibrium paths, the results \n\nobtained by the authors described in Section 2.3.1 can be visualized qualitatively in terms of \n\ninternal pressure. For small imperfections, the critical internal pressures tend to the critical \n\ninternal pressures obtained for perfect pipelines using the small deflection theory (Table 4). If \n\nthe imperfections increase, the critical internal pressures decrease. The equilibrium paths, \n\nhowever, present a smoother stiffness change during the load application and the displacements \n\ndo not change so abruptly. \n\nThe next stage of the numerical analysis consists in applying compressive axial \n\nforces in the pipelines corresponding to the internal pressures of the previous stage (Table 5). \n\nThese forces are applied as follower and non-follower loads (load type b and load type c, \n\nrespectively). The results are obtained for the imperfection of 1000 N and compared to the \n\nresults obtained from the application of the load type a. \n\n \n\nFigure 49 \u2013 Post-buckling configurations \u2013 static analysis \u2013 load types \u2013 case 1. \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n\ny\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nx (m)\n\nInternal pressure (load type a) Follower compressive axial force (load type b) Non-follower compressive axial force (load type c)\n\n\n\n118 \n\n \n\nFigure 50 \u2013 Equilibrium paths (midspan) \u2013 static analysis \u2013 load types \u2013 case 1. \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nFigure 51 \u2013 Post-buckling configurations \u2013 static analysis \u2013 load types \u2013 case 2. \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nFigure 52 \u2013 Equilibrium paths (midspan) \u2013 static analysis \u2013 load types \u2013 case 2. \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nFigure 53 \u2013 Post-buckling configurations \u2013 static analysis \u2013 load types \u2013 case 3.  \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n-452862\n\n-377385\n\n-301908\n\n-226431\n\n-150954\n\n-75477\n\n00.0E+00\n\n2.5E+05\n\n5.0E+05\n\n7.5E+05\n\n1.0E+06\n\n1.3E+06\n\n1.5E+06\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\n\nC\no\n\nm\np\n\nr\ne\ns\ns\niv\n\ne\n a\n\nx\nia\n\nl \nfo\n\nr\nc\ne\n (\n\nN\n)\n\nIn\nte\n\nr\nn\n\na\nl \n\np\nr\ne\ns\ns\nu\n\nr\ne\n (\n\nP\na\n)\n\ny (m)\n\nInternal pressure (load type a) Follower compressive axial force (load type b) Non-follower compressive axial force (load type c)\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n\ny\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nx (m)\n\nInternal pressure (load type a) Follower compressive axial force (load type b) Non-follower compressive axial force (load type c)\n\n-1.81E+06\n\n-1.21E+06\n\n-6.04E+05\n\n0.00E+000.0E+00\n\n2.0E+06\n\n4.0E+06\n\n6.0E+06\n\n0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 C\no\n\nm\np\n\nr\ne\ns\nsi\n\nv\ne\n a\n\nx\nia\n\nl \nfo\n\nr\nc\ne\n (\n\nN\n)\n\nIn\nte\n\nr\nn\n\na\nl \n\n p\nr\ne\ns\nsu\n\nr\ne\n (\n\nP\na\n)\n\ny (m)\n\nInternal pressure (load type a) Follower compressive axial force (load type b) Non-follower compressive axial force (load type c)\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n\ny\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nx (m)\n\nInternal pressure (load type a) Follower compressive axial force (load type b) Non-follower compressive axial force (load type c)\n\n\n\n119 \n\n \n\nFigure 54 \u2013 Equilibrium paths (midspan) \u2013 static analysis \u2013 load types \u2013 case 3. \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nFrom Figure 49 to Figure 54, it is possible to see that the three load approaches \n\nprovide equivalent critical loads. However, the post-buckling configurations do not coincide \n\nfor all approaches. Only the analyses with load type a and load type b result in the same post-\n\nbuckling configurations and equilibrium paths. It happens because the internal pressure has a \n\nfollower behavior, depending on the deflections of the pipeline. The deflections and the \n\nrotations are not small for the post-buckling deformed configurations. Therefore, the direction \n\nof the equivalent compressive axial force has to be updated as the pipe deflects to provide the \n\nsame results obtained using the load type a. The only exception is the second case in which the \n\nthree load approaches coincide. It occurs because both pipe ends are unable to rotate. Thus, the \n\nfollower load does not change its direction. \n\nOnce determined and analyzed the equilibrium paths of the three cases of \n\nboundary conditions, it is interesting to use the Lyapunov\u2019s first method to analyze the stability \n\nof the pipeline during the load application. For that, it is necessary to determine the eigenvalues \n\nof the system\u2019s state variable matrix, analyzing their values and signs. As the results of the three \n\ncases generate similar discussions, only the results of the case 1, with load type a and \n\nimperfection magnitude of 1000 N, are presented. Figure 55 shows the evolution of the lowest \n\neigenvalue during the load application. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n-9.1E+05\n\n-6.0E+05\n\n-3.0E+05\n\n0.0E+000.0E+00\n\n1.0E+06\n\n2.0E+06\n\n3.0E+06\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14\n\nC\no\n\nm\np\n\nr\ne\ns\ns\niv\n\ne\n a\n\nx\nia\n\nl \nfo\n\nr\nc\ne\n (\n\nN\n)\n\nIn\nte\n\nr\nn\n\na\nl \n\np\nr\ne\ns\ns\nu\n\nr\ne\n (\n\nP\na\n)\n\ny (m)\n\nInternal pressure (load type a) Follower compressive axial force (load type b) Non-follower compressive axial force (load type c)\n\n\n\n120 \n\n \n\nFigure 55 \u2013 Eigenvalues \u2013 load type a \u2013 case 1 with imperfection of 1000 N. \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nFrom Figure 55, it is possible to see that the whole time-series of the eigenvalue \n\nis real positive. Therefore, during the application of the load, all equilibrium configurations are \n\nstable. It does not mean that the buckling does not occur, but that the pipeline, even after the \n\nbuckling occurrence, can find a different equilibrium configuration that is stable. Once there is \n\na new equilibrium configuration, the trivial straight configuration loses its stability. So, if it is \n\nnecessary to estimate the load magnitude for which the buckling occurs, one can simulate the \n\nsame problem without imperfections. The results are shown in Figure 56. It can be noted that \n\nthe real positive eigenvalue decreases until zero and becomes negative, featuring the instability \n\ncalled divergence (BAZANT; CEDOLIN, 2010). The load for which this transition occurs is \n\nthe critical load for a perfect pipeline, which coincides with the critical internal pressure \n\nobtained from Figure 44. In other words, the straight configuration, although it is an equilibrium \n\nconfiguration since there is no imperfection and the buckling does not occur, becomes unstable. \n\nIf an imperfection is imposed, as presented in Figure 55, the pipeline naturally seeks for another \n\nequilibrium configuration, which is, in the present case, stable. \n\n \n\nFigure 56 \u2013 Eigenvalues \u2013 load type a \u2013 case 1 without imperfection. \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n0.00E+00 2.00E+05 4.00E+05 6.00E+05 8.00E+05 1.00E+06 1.20E+06\n\nE\nig\n\ne\nn\n\nv\na\nlu\n\ne\ns\n\nInternal  pressure (Pa)\n\nReal part Imaginary part\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n0.00E+00 2.00E+05 4.00E+05 6.00E+05 8.00E+05 1.00E+06 1.20E+06\n\nE\nig\n\ne\nn\n\nv\na\nlu\n\ne\ns\n\nInternal  pressure (Pa)\n\nReal part Imaginary part\n\n\n\n121 \n\n \n\nThe case 4 of Table 4 has not been commented yet.

It is coherent since the load nature (follower), \n\nthe boundary conditions and the deflected pipeline generate a resultant that acts in the opposite \n\nsense of imperfection. It occurs until the pipe curvature reverses, when the deflections change \n\ntheir sense. This process should occur cyclically (and dynamically). It can be observed from \n\nFigure 58 and Figure 59 that if the static analysis is used to perform the simulations, the critical \n\ninternal pressure corresponding to the critical load indicated in Table 4 is not identified. \n\nAlthough the applied internal pressure is much larger than the critical internal pressure obtained \n\nfor a perfect pipeline using the small deflection theory, the pipeline does not buckle. It occurs \n\nbecause the method of analysis is not compatible with the system proposed. The system \n\nanalyzed is not conservative, but circulatory. Thus, the discussions presented in Section 3 can \n\nbe applied in this case. The correct way to analyze the problem is to use a dynamic approach, \n\nonce the simplification given by the static analysis leads to erroneous results, as previously \n\npredicted by Ziegler (1968). Therefore, the critical load is not that obtained by the Euler\u2019s \n\nproblem (Table 4) but that obtained by Eq. (130).   \n\nTo perform the dynamic analysis, the load is also applied three-way at the free \n\nend of the pipeline. Load types a, b and c remain the same as those described for the cases 1, 2 \n\nand 3. In order to represent a quasi-static behavior, without relevant excitation to any natural \n\nvibration mode of the structure, such loads are applied linearly from zero, at the initial time, to \n\nthe values indicated in Table 6, at the time 316 s.  \n\n \n\nTable 6 \u2013 Load data for dynamic analyses. \n\nCase \n\nFirst critical \n\nload \u00e4\u00e5  \n(N) \n\nCritical internal \n\npressure \u00e6\u00e7N~\u00e7? \n(Pa) \n\nApplied loads  \n\nLoad type \n\na \n\n(Pa) \n\nLoad type \n\nb  \n\n(N) \n\nLoad type \n\nc  \n\n(N) \n\n Eq.

The same analysis that was made \n\nfor cases 1, 2 and 3 may be made again for case 4: the critical load (obtained from the equivalent \n\ncritical time of Figure 61) for pipelines with small imperfections tends to the critical load for \n\nperfect pipelines \u2013 Eq. (130). Besides this, from Figure 61, it can be noted that the instability \n\nof the system is characterized by crescent oscillation amplitudes (flutter). \n\nFrom Figure 62 and Figure 63, it is observed again an equivalence between the \n\nanalyses performed with internal pressure and follower compressive axial force. The problem \n\nwith non-follower compressive axial force presents results totally different since it represents \n\nanother phenomenon (conservative) that does not characterize the internal pressure effects and \n\ncould be analyzed statically. \n\nOne aspect that differentiates the case 4 from the other cases is the instability \n\ntype. In the cases 1, 2 and 3, the instability is characterized by the divergence whereas the \n\ninstability of case 4 is characterized by the flutter (BAZANT; CEDOLIN, 2010).  So, to finalize \n\nthe analyses of the geometrically-simple models, a more accurate analysis of this difference can \n\nbe done by the extraction of the eigenvalues of the system\u2019s state variable matrix and by the \n\nLyapunov\u2019s first method. Figure 64 shows the evolution of the two lowest eigenvalues during \n\nthe load application for the case 4, with load type a and imperfection magnitude of 1000 N. It \n\nis possible to see that the time for which the two real positive eigenvalues become equal and \n\nimaginary parts appear coincides with the time for which the flutter starts (Figure 65 and Figure \n\n63, respectively). \n\n-5\n\n10\n\n25\n\n40\n\n55\n\n70\n\n85\n\n-5\n\n5\n\n15\n\n0 70 140 210 280 350\n\ny\n (\n\nm\n) \n\nfo\nr\n l\n\no\na\nd\n\n t\ny\np\n\ne\n c\n\ny\n (\n\nm\n) \n\nfo\nr\n l\n\no\na\nd\n\n t\ny\np\n\ne\ns \n\na\n a\n\nn\nd\n\n b\n\nTi me (s)\n\nInternal pressure (load type a) Follower compressive axial force (load type b) Non-follower compressive axial force (load type c)\n\n\n\n125 \n\n \n\nFigure 64 \u2013 Eigenvalues \u2013 load type a \u2013 case 4 with imperfection of 1000 N. \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nFigure 65 \u2013 Eigenvalues \u2013 load type a \u2013 case 4 with imperfection of 1000 N \u2013 detail. \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\n5.3 ADVANCED MODELS \n\n \n\nThis section presents the description and the results of the set of simulations that \n\nuse contact models to represent the interaction between the pipeline and the ground on which it \n\nis laid. It is intended that the boundary conditions of the models in this section result mainly \n\nfrom such interaction and that the end supports are of less relevance for the study of the buckling \n\nof pipelines. So, here, the length of the pipelines is 1000 m. It is larger than the length of the \n\npipelines of the previous simulations in order to distance the buckle region (central region of \n\nthe pipeline) from the pipeline ends and, thus, to avoid possible interferences of them in the \n\nbuckling. The pipelines are discretized with 1001 equidistant nodes, totaling 500 beam \n\nelements. \n\nSection 5.3.1 shows a simplified buckling scenario in which, although the \n\npipeline is in contact with the soil, the imperfection is imposed as a concentrated force. The aim \n\nof this section is to perform initial verifications and analyses of the numerical model, having as \n\nreference the model presented by Taylor and Tran (1996).

The models of Section \n\n5.3.2 also consolidate the discussions about the approaches for applying the internal pressure \n\npromoted in Section 5.2. \n\n \n\n5.3.1 Models with imperfections imposed as concentrated forces \n\n \n\nTo simulate the upheaval buckling process proposed by Taylor and Tran (1996), \n\nthe pipeline is disposed straightly at the level of a rigid surface that represents the soil (Figure \n\n66). Such rigid surface is modeled with the triangular rigid surfaces described in Section 4.3. \n\nNo friction between the pipeline and the soil is considered. The displacement in z-direction of \n\nall pipeline nodes is restricted in order to induce the upheaval buckling. Besides this, the \n\npipeline end nodes are initially fixed to avoid rigid body movements that may occur prior to the \n\nestablishment of the contact between the pipeline and the soil. The pipeline under these \n\nconditions is then subjected to a sequence of static load steps that represent partially the stages \n\nof the upheaval buckling proposed by Taylor and Tran (1996) for an imperfection amplitude of \n\n0.50 m. These load steps are described in Table 7. \n\n \n\nFigure 66 \u2013 Initial layout of the simplified model \u2013 plan view.  \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nFrom an idealized straight configuration of the pipeline, the load step 1 of the \n\nstatic analysis, through the pipeline self-weight and the upward-directed force calculated from \n\nEq. (84), establishes the imperfect initial configuration of the pipeline. Assuming that the \n\nground is at the level y = 0, Figure 67 presents a comparison between the initial configurations \n\nobtained analytically and numerically. It is possible to see that the two configurations are almost \n\nthe same. Only some differences near the lift-off points of the buckle region can be noted. \n\n\n\n127 \n\n \n\nTable 7 \u2013 Static load steps used to simulate numerically the stages of the upheaval buckling in \n\nthe simplified model. \n\nLoad steps Description \n\n1 \n\nApplication of the pipeline self-weight and of a concentrated upward-\n\ndirected force at the central node of the pipeline, whose magnitude is \n\n143175.82 N, calculated from Eq.

The load step 3, in its turn, fixes the position of the central \n\nnode of the pipeline, transforming the force applied in load step 1 into a reaction arising from \n\nthe restriction to the displacement in y-direction of this node. \n\nThe pre-upheaval flexure described by Taylor and Tran (1996) is simulated \n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n-500 -300 -100 100 300 500\n\ny\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nx (m)\n\nTaylor and Tran\nLoad step 1\n\n-0.002\n\n-0.001\n\n0.000\n\n0.001\n\n0.002\n\n40 42 44 46 48 50\n\ny\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nx (m)\n\nTaylor and Tran\nLoad step 1\n\n\n\n128 \n\n \n\nthrough the load step 4. It is worth mentioning that the initial configuration of the pipeline laid \n\non the prop imperfection is not stress free in the numerical simulation. Therefore, the best \n\nexpression to estimate the axial force for which the pipeline loses its contact with the \n\nimperfection is Eq. (98). Under such force, the length of the pipeline that is not in contact with \n\nthe ground is reduced. The comparison between the pipeline configuration resulting from load \n\nstep 1 and the pipeline configuration resulting from load step 4 is shown in Figure 68. \n\n \n\nFigure 68 \u2013 Comparison between the pipeline configurations resulting from load step 1 and \n\nload step 4. \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nIt is expected that, by releasing the displacement in y-direction of the central \n\nnode in load step 5, the pipeline configuration remains the same as the one obtained in load step \n\n4, because the force calculated from Eq. (98), according to Taylor and Tran (1996), cancels the \n\nreaction at the point of contact between the pipeline and the imperfection. In other words, by \n\nreleasing the displacement in y-direction of the central node, the tendency of the pipeline to \n\nmove down caused by its self-weight should be compensated by the tendency of the pipeline to \n\nmove up caused by the axial forces applied in load step 4. However, the central node moved \n\nabout 0.02 m down relative to the configuration obtained in load step 4 (Figure 69). This \n\ndifference occurred because the reaction at the central node did not become exactly zero in load \n\nstep 4. That is, the forces applied in load step 4 are slightly larger than those required to cancel \n\nthe force of the prop imperfection, as it can be seen in Figure 70, which shows that the reaction, \n\nalthough very close to zero, becomes negative in load step 4. One could expect that eliminating \n\nsuch negative reaction, by releasing the displacement in y-direction of the central node, it would \n\nincrease the amplitude y in load step 5, but the opposite occurs (Figure 69). The explanation \n\nmay be found in the interpretation of Eq. (98): with EI fixed, an axial force larger than the \n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n-50 -40 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50\n\ny\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nx (m)\n\nLoad step 1 Load step 4\n\n\n\n129 \n\n \n\nnecessary implies in obtaining a smaller buckle length. This is geometrically related to a smaller \n\nbuckle amplitude. This is why the pipeline moves down with the release of the displacement in \n\ny-direction of the central node of the pipeline: to lead to a smaller buckle length. \n\n \n\nFigure 69 \u2013 Comparison between the pipeline configurations resulting from load step 4 and \n\nload step 5. \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nFigure 70 \u2013 Reaction at the central node of the pipeline. \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nAt this point, it is already possible to see slightly differences between the \n\nanalytical and numerical approaches. These occur due to both mathematical simplifications and \n\ndifferences in the assumptions adopted for the structural analysis. It is important to remember \n\nthat, in general, the analytical models assume many simplifications such as: totally rigid soil \n\nand linear analysis with small rotations and displacements.

The foundation stiffness k?+?? can be estimated with \nthe aid of the normal penalty parameter ?? per node used in the model (1.00 GN/m) and the \narea of influence of the node, given by the multiplication of the distance between nodes d? by \nthe pipeline external diameter D?. Using Eq. (191), the k?+?? results in 1.54 GN/m3 for the \npresent model, representing a soil with high stiffness. Based on B\u00e9ton-Kalender (1962 apud \n\nMORAES, 1976, p. 15), such level of stiffness can already be considered representative of \n\nrocks. \n\n \n\nk?+?? =  ??d?D? (191) \n \n\nOnce the imminence of loss of contact was achieved by the static load steps \n\ndescribed in Table 7, additional compressive axial forces are applied dynamically at the pipeline \n\nend nodes in order to obtain post-critical configurations. The dynamic analysis was chosen \n\nbecause, mainly due to the boundary conditions, it is difficult to predict if the systems are \n\nconservative or not in the advanced models of the present work. So, since the dynamic analysis \n\nis the fundamental test of stability, it eliminates conceptual doubts regarding the system nature \n\nand the best type of analysis to be employed. The additional forces have magnitude equal to \n\n2000000 N and are applied in 16 s to generate a quasi-static simulation, as already mentioned. \n\nFigure 71 relates the axial forces applied to the buckle amplitudes resulting from the application \n\nof these forces. The graph includes only the load range considered relevant, as well as other \n\ngraphs shown later in this work. \n\nIn order to compare the results of post-buckling configurations obtained from \n\nthe analytical model proposed by Taylor and Tran (1996) and from the numerical model, the \n\npresent work takes as reference the post-buckling configuration at the time 1.2 s (Figure 72), \n\nwhich refers to a total compressive axial force of 4822343.81 N (force applied statically plus \n\nforce applied dynamically at the time 1.2 s).  \n\nFrom Figure 72, it is determined that the buckle length at the time 1.2 s is \n\napproximately 72 m. With this information and using the post-upheaval buckling formulation \n\nof Taylor and Tran (1996), described with details in Section 2.3.1.2, to determine the \n\n\n\n131 \n\n \n\ncompressive axial force that corresponds to the specific pipeline configuration shown in Figure \n\n72, the magnitude 2842042.51 N is reached. Apparently, the value obtained is quite different \n\nfrom the value applied in the numerical model. However, the formulation proposed by Taylor \n\nand Tran (1996) assumes that the initial configuration of the pipeline is stress free. Such \n\ncondition is not the same in the present numerical model. So, in order to compare compatible \n\nvalues, it is possible to think that the difference between the upheaval axial forces obtained by \n\nEq. (97) and Eq. (98) can be considered as an additional axial force due to the pre-stress effect, \n\nreaching 4883879.73 N. Comparing this result to the compressive axial force applied in \n\nnumerical model, it can be observed a difference of approximately 1.26%, which is quite \n\nacceptable, given all the differences between the models. It is possible to say that, for this load \n\nlevel, the assumption of small displacements and rotations still provides good results. With the \n\nincrease of the load, the differences become larger, since this assumption is no longer valid. \n\n \n\nFigure 71 \u2013 Buckle amplitude y versus additional axial force. \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n0.0E+00 5.0E+04 1.0E+05 1.5E+05 2.0E+05 2.5E+05 3.0E+05 3.5E+05 4.0E+05 4.5E+05\n\ny\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nAddi tional axi al force (N)\n\n\n\n132 \n\n \n\nFigure 72 \u2013 Post-buckling configuration of the pipeline for a total compressive axial force of \n\n4822343.81 N. \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nComparisons between the pipeline post-buckling configurations obtained using \n\nTaylor and Tran (1996) and the simplified numerical model presented in this section cannot be \n\nmade directly since the analytical model was described only for stress free initial configurations. \n\nUnlike the critical load that could be estimated considering the pre-stress effect, modifications \n\nin the post-upheaval buckling formulation are not straightforward, not being scope of the \n\npresent work.

So, the imperfection can be \n\ndetected by the contact model as a region of the soil. The imposition of the imperfection in such \n\na way represents a step forward in relation to the model presented in Section 5.3.1, making the \n\nsimulations closer to the mechanisms that occur in reality. This is because, in the simulation of \n\nSection 5.3.1, the loss of contact between the pipe and the imperfection was imposed manually \n\nby eliminating the restriction to the displacement in y-direction of the central node when Po is \nreached, which is a procedure based on the analytical formulation proposed by Taylor and Tran \n\n(1996). That is, it was not possible to \u201cdisconnect\u201d the numerical models from the analytical \n\nmodels, which is not convenient in practice.  \n\nFor modeling the isolated imperfection, it is used the oscillatory rigid surface \n\ndescribed in Section 4.3. Four imperfection amplitudes are used to perform the simulations: \n\n0.05 m, 0.25 m, 0.50 m and 1.00 m. These imperfections are modeled with one wave in each \n\ndirection (Figure 74). Besides this, the wave-lengths in each direction are chosen in such a way \n\nthat the pipeline, when released from the level of the imperfection and under the action of its \n\nself-weight, establishes only one point of contact with the top of the imperfection. It originates \n\nthe afore called prop imperfection and, to obey this condition, the resulting imperfection wave-\n\nlengths are, respectively: 2.5 m, 12.5 m, 25 m and 50 m. The parameters of Eq. (187) assumed \n\nto create the imperfections are described in Table 8 and Table 9.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n134 \n\n \n\nFigure 74 \u2013 Location and shape of the isolated imperfection.  \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nTable 8 \u2013 Parameters used to create the prop imperfections \u2013 part 1. \n\nImp.

Figure 75 \n\nillustrates the initial layout of the pipeline.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n135 \n\n \n\nFigure 75 \u2013 Initial layout of the models with imperfections represented by rigid surfaces \u2013 \n\nplan view and elevation. \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nFor establishing the imperfect initial configuration of the pipeline from the initial \n\nlayout, it is necessary to simulate the process of laying the pipeline on the prop imperfection. \n\nThis stage is developed statically through four load steps, which seek to eliminate possible \n\nnumerical problems due to rigid body movement during the laying process. The four load steps \n\nare described in Table 10. \n\n \n\nTable 10 \u2013 Static load steps used to simulate the laying process of the pipeline on the ground \n\nwith a prop imperfection. \n\nLoad steps Description \n\n1 Application of the pipeline self-weight. \n\n2 Restriction of all degrees of freedom of the central node of the pipeline. \n\n3 \nRelease of all degrees of freedom, with the exception of the displacement \n\nin z-direction, of the end nodes of the pipeline. \n\n4 \nRelease of all degrees of freedom, with the exception of the displacement \n\nin z-direction, of the central node of the pipeline. \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nAt the end of the laying process, the imperfect initial configuration of the \n\npipeline is established with a reaction at the central node that represents the contact between \n\nthe pipeline and the soil. It is possible to use this reaction as a parameter of comparison between \n\n\n\n136 \n\n \n\nthe present model and the analytical model proposed by Taylor and Tran (1996). For example, \n\nfor the case with imperfection amplitude equal to 0.50 m, the contact force that appears at the \n\ncentral node is 143130 N, which differs only in 0.032% from the force applied in load step 1 of \n\nthe model of Section 5.3.1. \n\nOnce the imperfect initial configuration of the pipeline has been established, it \n\nis subjected dynamically to the internal pressure load. The analysis of the influence of the \n\nimperfection amplitude in upheaval buckling is made firstly from the results obtained through \n\nthe application of follower compressive axial forces equivalent to the internal pressure at the \n\npipeline end nodes. Then, the same type of results is obtained through the application of the \n\ninternal pressure properly speaking, by Eq. (190). As already mentioned, the follower \n\ncompressive axial force was estimated by analytical prediction \u2013 Eq. (98), but taking a larger \n\nvalue to also capture post-buckling configurations. So, the magnitude chosen is 25000000 N. \n\nUsing Eq. (188), the corresponding internal pressure is approximately 82806942 Pa. \n\nThe graph of the coordinate y of the central node of the pipeline versus the \n\nfollower compressive axial force is shown in Figure 76 for the four ratios between the \n\nimperfection amplitude and the imperfection wave-length analyzed. The graph presented in \n\nFigure 77, in its turn, shows the coordinate y of the central node of the pipeline versus the \n\ninternal pressure for the same imperfections. Finally, Figure 78 presents a comparison between \n\nFigure 76 and Figure 77 in terms of the time of load application, which can be obtained using \n\nFigure 38. \n\n \n\nFigure 76 \u2013 Coordinate y of the central node versus the load applied \u2013 follower axial force. \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n0.0E+00 2.0E+06 4.0E+06 6.0E+06 8.0E+06 1.0E+07 1.2E+07 1.4E+07 1.6E+07 1.8E+07 2.0E+07\n\ny\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nFollower axial force (N)\n\n5 cm/ 2.5 m 25 cm/ 12.5 m 50 cm/ 25 m 100 cm/ 50 m\n\n\n\n137 \n\n \n\nFigure 77 \u2013 Coordinate y of the central node versus the load applied \u2013 internal pressure. \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nFigure 78 \u2013 Coordinate y of the central node versus the load applied \u2013 comparison between \n\nthe application of follower axial forces and internal pressure. \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nThrough Figure 78, it is possible to observe the equivalence between the \n\napplication of the compressive axial forces and the application of the internal pressure by Eq. \n\n(190), since Eq. (188) is obeyed. The two approaches provide approximately the same graphs \n\nof the coordinate y of the pipeline central node versus the load applied. It is important to \n\nmention that the compressive axial forces have the same follower behavior as the internal \n\npressure, in which the direction of the forces depends on the pipeline deflections. For the cases \n\nshown in the present section, however, in which the buckle region is limited to the central region \n\nof the pipeline, the follower behavior of the axial forces is not an essential factor for the \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n0.0E+00 1.0E+07 2.0E+07 3.0E+07 4.0E+07 5.0E+07 6.0E+07 7.0E+07\n\ny\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nInternal pressure (Pa)\n\n5 cm/ 2.5 m 25 cm/ 12.5 m 50 cm/ 25 m 100 cm/ 50 m\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16\n\ny\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nTime (s)\n\n5 cm/ 2.5 m (follower axial force) 5 cm/ 2.5 m (internal pressure) 25 cm/ 12.5 m (follower axial force)\n\n25 cm/ 12.5 m (internal pressure) 50 cm/ 25 m (follower axial force) 50 cm/ 25 m (internal pressure)\n\n100 cm/ 50 m (follower axial force) 100 cm/ 50 m (internal pressure)\n\n\n\n138 \n\n \n\ncoincidence of the results of the two load approaches. It occurs because the axial loads are \n\napplied at the pipeline ends, so their directions do not change significantly. If the buckle region \n\nextended over the entire length of the pipeline, the axial force behavior would play a more \n\nimportant role for the coincidence of the results. \n\nAnother topic that can be analyzed from Figure 76, Figure 77 and Figure 78 is \n\nthe influence of the imperfection amplitude in the buckling critical load. It is possible to observe \n\nthat larger imperfection amplitudes lead to smaller buckling critical loads, which coincides with \n\nthe previous results of several authors mentioned in Section 2.3. Another aspect that can be \n\ncommented is that the buckling critical load does not change in the same ratio of the \n\nimperfection amplitude. Besides this, the ratio between the variation of critical load and of \n\nimperfection amplitude is dependent on the imperfection amplitude. Figure 79 demonstrates \n\nthe nonlinear relationship between the critical loads and the imperfection amplitudes. \n\n \n\nFigure 79 \u2013 Critical load versus imperfection amplitude. \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nBesides the comparisons between the critical loads for different imperfections, \n\nit is important to present comparisons in terms of post-buckling configurations. It is worth \n\nmentioning that, although there are analytical studies that present expressions for the deformed \n\nconfiguration of the pipeline, comparisons of the shapes of these configurations are not so \n\ncommon in those studies. They are necessary to understand how is the pipeline behavior after \n\nthe buckling begins. Figure 80 to Figure 83 present the post-buckling configurations for the \n\nfour imperfections analyzed. Since such configurations are symmetrical, only half of the \n\npipeline is presented. It can be observed that, for the same load increase from the buckling \n\ncritical loads, the smallest imperfection amplitude leads to the largest displacements in y-\n\ndirection and as the amplitude increases, such displacements tend to stabilize with smaller \n\n0.0E+00\n\n1.3E+07\n\n2.6E+07\n\n4.0E+07\n\n5.3E+07\n\n0.0E+00\n\n4.0E+06\n\n8.0E+06\n\n1.2E+07\n\n1.6E+07\n\n0.05 0.25 0.50 1.00\n\nE\ns\nti\n\nm\na\nte\n\nd\n  \nin\n\nte\nrn\n\na\nl \n\n p\nre\n\ns\ns\nu\n\nre\n  f\n\no\nr \n\n w\nh\n\nic\nh\n\n \nb\n\nu\nc\nk\n\nli\nn\n\ng\n  \no\n\nc\nc\nu\n\nrs\n (\n\nP\na\n)\n\nE\ns\nti\n\nm\na\nte\n\nd\n  \nfo\n\nll\no\n\nw\ne\n\nr \n a\n\nx\nia\n\nl \n f\n\no\nrc\n\ne\n  \nfo\n\nr \nw\n\nh\nic\n\nh\n  \n\nb\nu\n\nc\nk\n\nli\nn\n\ng\n  \no\n\nc\nc\nu\n\nrs\n (\n\nN\n)\n\nImpe rfe ction amplitude  (m)\n\n\n\n139 \n\n \n\nvalues.

This is a \n\nlimitation of the numerical model since, obviously, this is not always valid in practice, \n\ndepending on the level of stress to which the pipeline is subjected and on the material strength. \n\nAlthough the intention of the work is not to address the plastic deformation range of the steel, \n\nit is important to verify, for the cases studied, even if simplistically, for which level of loading \n\nthe elastic-linear assumption remains valid using the steel API 5L X80. For that, the Von Misses \n\ncriterion is used. \n\nFigure 84 shows the evolution of the Von Mises stress at the central cross section \n\nof the pipeline during the application of the internal pressure for the imperfection amplitude \n\nequal to 0.05 m. For the evaluation of the Von Mises stress by Eq. (17), only the longitudinal \n\nand hoop stresses (determined from the internal loads of the structure and from Eq. (12), \n\nrespectively) are considered, that is, it is assumed that the pipeline is a thin-walled pipe. It is \n\nalso worth mentioning that always the worst combination of stresses (unfavorable for safety) \n\nwas considered to determine the Von Mises stress. Figure 85, for a visual understanding of the \n\nlimit of the elastic-linear assumption, shows the relationship between the normal stress at the \n\ncentral cross section of the pipeline and the coordinate y of its axis. It is possible to see that, \n\nbefore the beginning of the pipeline upheaval, the stress exceeds the yielding strength of the \n\nsteel API 5L X80 and, therefore, the elastic-linear assumption is not valid and the pipeline starts \n\nto have plastic strains.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n-0.40\n\n0.00\n\n0.40\n\n0.80\n\n1.20\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50\n\ny\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nx (m)\n\nJust before the upheaval (tref)\nJust after the upheaval (tref + 0.2 s)\n\n* tref = 2.2 s\n\n-1.0\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50\n\ny\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nx (m)\n\nJust before the upheaval (tref)\nPost-buckling configuration (tref + 0.6 s)\n\n* tref = 2.2 s\n\n\n\n141 \n\n \n\nFigure 84 \u2013 Von Mises stress at the central cross section of the pipeline versus internal \n\npressure for the imperfection 0.05 m/2.5 m. \n\n  \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nFigure 85 \u2013 Von Mises stress at the central cross section of the pipeline versus coordinate y \n\nfor the imperfection 0.05 m/2.5 m. \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nThe same analysis can be done for the other three imperfections.

For the cases of imperfection of the present work, only the imperfection of 0.05 m \n\nled to the yielding of the steel before the pipeline upheaval. One explanation for this is in the \n\nfact that the pipeline with the smallest imperfection buckles with the largest load, generating \n\nmore stress due to the increase of internal pressure, in addition to generating more accentuated \n\ndisplacements when the buckling occurs. At the current stage of the research, it is not possible \n\nto predict if the consideration of the plasticity implies in significant changes in the results of \n\nthe present model. As commented, it does not belong to the scope of the present work, but it \n\ncan be part of a future continuation of it.  \n\n \n\n5.3.2.2 Pointwise contact versus conformal contact between the pipeline and the imperfection \n\n \n\nAs mentioned, the shape of the imperfections adopted to perform the simulations \n\nwas chosen in such a way that the imperfect initial configuration of the pipeline had only one \n\npoint of contact with the top of the imperfection, which characterizes the prop imperfection. It \n\nis worth mentioning that, besides this type of imperfection with a pointwise contact with the \n\npipeline, a type of imperfection with a conformal contact also was studied. The results, \n\nhowever, were not relevant for the context of this work and, therefore, they will not be presented \n\nwith the same details as it is done for the prop imperfection. Only some considerations and \n\n2.0E+08\n\n2.5E+08\n\n3.0E+08\n\n3.5E+08\n\n4.0E+08\n\n4.5E+08\n\n5.0E+08\n\n5.5E+08\n\n6.0E+08\n\n0.00 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 3.00 3.50\n\nV\no\n\nn\n M\n\nis\ne\ns \n\ns\ntr\n\ne\nss\n\n (\nP\n\na\n)\n\ny (m)\n\nVon Mises stress during the load application Yielding strength Beginning of the pipeline upheaval\n\n\n\n147 \n\n \n\ncomparisons are interesting to be made. \n\nThe amplitudes chosen for the study of the conformal imperfections are the same \n\nas those chosen for the study of the prop imperfections: 0.05 m, 0.25 m, 0.50 m and 1.00 m. To \n\ntransform the prop imperfections into the corresponding conformal imperfections, it is \n\nnecessary to increase the wave-lengths to 280 m, 620 m, 820 m and 990 m, respectively, in such \n\na way that the pipeline, after the laying process, is totally in contact with the imperfection. \n\nAnalytical models, as that presented by Taylor and Gan (1986), propose that the shape of the \n\nimperfect initial configuration of the pipeline, which coincides with the imperfection shape, \n\nresults from a vertical deviation from the idealized straight lay of the pipeline. In present \n\nnumerical models, however, it is not possible to create an imperfection that has the shape of the \n\nelastic line of the deformed pipeline, because the imperfection follows the shape of the \n\noscillatory rigid surface, which requires larger wave-lengths than those presented in the \n\nanalytical models to generate conformal imperfections.  \n\nComparing the buckling critical loads of the pipelines laid on prop imperfections \n\nand on conformal imperfections, it can be verified that the last cases have critical loads much \n\nlarger than the first cases. The model with imperfection amplitude of 0.50 m can be used to \n\nexemplify the order of magnitude of the results obtained. In the case of the pipeline laid on the \n\nprop imperfection, the buckling critical load, in terms of equivalent compressive axial force, is \n\napproximately 5.00 MN. In the case of the pipeline laid on the conformal imperfection, in its \n\nturn, the buckling critical load is approximately 165 MN (400 MN were applied in 16 s in order \n\nto capture the buckling). It can be noted that the increase of critical load is quite significant, in \n\nthe order of 3200%. \n\nThe explanation for the difference of critical loads can be associated with the \n\nexisting voids between the pipeline and the soil in the case of the prop imperfection and to the \n\nabsence of such voids in the case of the conformal imperfection. The presence of voids allows \n\nthe pipeline inward movement, using energy for the pre-upheaval flexure. In the case of the \n\nconformal imperfection, however, there is no space for the shortening of the initial wave-length Lm, that is, there is no pre-upheaval flexure. With such condition, the pipeline accumulates \nenergy when it tries to compress the imperfection, increasing the buckling critical load. The \n\ndescriptions of the pipeline pre-upheaval stages are presented schematically in Figure 95 and \n\nFigure 96 for the prop imperfection and for the conformal imperfection, respectively. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n148 \n\n \n\nFigure 95 \u2013 Prop imperfection. \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nFigure 96 \u2013 Conformal imperfection. \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nBesides the difference between the critical loads, the prop imperfection and the \n\nconformal imperfection analyzed induce different buckling modes in the pipeline. The buckling \n\nmode that arises in the prop imperfection case is the first buckling mode characterized by a \n\nhalf-wave and that requires the smallest critical load. The arising of this buckling mode starts \n\nto be outlined in the pre-upheaval flexure that occurs due to the existing voids. The conformal \n\nimperfection, unlike the previous, has an approximately initial uniform distribution of the \n\ncontact forces due to the continuous contact between the pipeline and the soil. It hinders the \n\npre-upheaval flexure of the pipeline, accumulating more energy in the pipeline with the increase \n\nof the load applied. So, when the buckling occurs, it occurs with a larger critical load and the \n\npipeline assumes a higher buckling mode with multiple waves. The difference of buckling \n\nmodes between the two types of imperfection analyzed can be seen schematically in Figure 97 \n\nand Figure 98. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n149 \n\n \n\nFigure 97 \u2013 Buckling mode of the prop imperfection. \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nFigure 98 \u2013 Buckling mode of the conformal imperfection. \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nFor the prop imperfection case, Figure 99 shows the evolution of the contact \n\nforces during the application of the dynamic load. It is possible to note that, with the increase \n\nof the load, there is a decrease of the contact force at the pipeline central node, that is, on the \n\ntop of the imperfection. This decrease is accompanied by the increase of the contact forces at \n\nthe ends of the buckle length. These, by the way, have an inward movement that demonstrates \n\nthe decrease of the buckle length that occurs in pre-upheaval flexure. From the instant that the \n\ncontact force at the central node becomes zero (Figure 99d), the pipeline upheaval starts. It is \n\nimportant to emphasize that there are also contact forces in the regions external to the buckle \n\nlength, but these forces have smaller magnitudes than those in the buckle region, not being \n\nvisible in the scale presented in Figure 99.  \n\n \n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n-80 -60 -40 -20 0 20 40 60 80\n\ny\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nx (m)\nPost-upheaval configuration Pre-upheaval configuration Imperfect initial configuration\n\n-2.0\n\n0.0\n\n2.0\n\n4.0\n\n6.0\n\n8.0\n\n10.0\n\n-500 -400 -300 -200 -100 0 100 200 300 400 500\n\ny\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nx (m)\n\nPost-upheaval configuration Initial configuration = pre-upheaval configuration\n\n\n\n150 \n\n \n\nFigure 99 \u2013 Contact forces for the prop imperfection case at the times 0.0 s, 1.0 s, 1.9 s, 3.0 s, \n\n3.4 s and 3.5 s. \n\n \n\n(a) at the time 0.0 s \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(b) at the time 1.0 s \n\n \n\n(c) at the time 1.9 s \n\n \n\n(d) at the time 3.0 s \n\n \n\n(e) at the time 3.4 s \n\n \n\n(f) at the time 3.5 s \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nFigure 100 to Figure 102, in their turn, show the evolution of the contact forces \n\nduring the application of the dynamic load for the conformal imperfection case. It is possible \n\nto note that, with the increase of the load, the initial uniform distribution of the contact forces \n\nis modified: there is a decrease of the contact forces at the central region of the imperfection \n\nand an increase of the contact forces at the end regions of the imperfection. However, there is \n\nno inward movement, that is, there is no pre-upheaval flexure. Figure 101 and Figure 102 \n\npresent details of the central region of the pipeline after the beginning of the upheaval. Since \n\nthe central contact forces that appear after the upheaval are quite large when compared to the \n\nadjacent forces, the latter do not appear in the scale of Figure 101 and Figure 102. \n\nThe two types of imperfections commented in the present work do not represent \n\nthe infinite types of imperfections that can happen in practice. Other types of imperfection can, \n\n\n\n151 \n\n \n\nfor example, increase or decrease the critical loads presented. Therefore, since the conformal \n\nimperfection analyzed is more favorable for safety, it will not be dealt with details in the present \n\nwork (from an engineering point of view). \n\n \n\nFigure 100 \u2013 Contact forces for the conformal imperfection case at the times 0.0 s, 1.9 s, 3.7 s \n\nand 6.3 s. \n\n \n\n(a) at the time 0.0 s \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(b) at the time 1.9 s \n\n \n\n(c) at the time 3.7 s \n\n \n\n(d) at the time 6.3 s  \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nFigure 101 \u2013 Contact forces for the conformal imperfection case at the time 6.5 s. \n\n \n\n(a) full view \n\n \n \n\n(b) detail \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n152 \n\n \n\nFigure 102 \u2013 Contact forces for the conformal imperfection case at the time 6.6 s. \n\n \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\n5.3.2.3 Influence of the friction between the pipeline and the soil in upheaval buckling \n\n \n\nAll previous simulations did not consider friction between the pipeline and the \n\nsoil. Although this condition is not compatible with practical cases, it allowed to analyze \n\nindependently the effects of the type of loading and of the imperfection amplitude in upheaval \n\nbuckling. Once these effects have been analyzed, the friction can be included in the numerical \n\nmodel in order to verify its influence in the upheaval buckling of pipelines. For each of the four \n\nimperfections presented, ten different coefficients of friction are used to perform the \n\nsimulations. These coefficients of friction range from 0.1 to 1.0 with a step of 0.1. \n\nWith respect to the approaches used for applying the internal pressure, only the \n\napplication of the internal pressure with the aid of Eq. (190) can be used directly in the models \n\nwith friction, in order to produce coherent results. This is because, since the friction can act \n\nover the entire length of the pipeline, only the distributed load of Eq. (190) provides realistic \n\nscenarios. If axial forces were applied in a concentrated way at the pipeline ends, they would \n\nhave their effects diminished gradually by the friction over the pipeline length. So, depending \n\non the pipeline length, the axial forces could be totally annulled by the friction, not allowing \n\nthe buckling of the pipeline. To use axial forces for representing approximately the internal \n\npressure effect, it is necessary to determine their magnitude from Eq. (188), incorporating the \n\nfriction effect in the term T?T. Such approach is commented in Bai and Bai (2014).

Besides this, for the \n\nsame imperfection amplitude, the influence of the friction in the buckling critical load is greater \n\nfor smaller coefficients of friction and as this coefficient increases, the variations of critical load \n\nare smaller. It is also possible to observe from the details, comparing the results of different \n\nimperfection amplitudes, that, although the difference is small, the influence of the friction in \n\nthe buckling critical load is greater for larger imperfection amplitudes. \n\nIn order to compare the post-buckling configurations for different coefficients of \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n0.0E+00 5.0E+06 1.0E+07 1.5E+07 2.0E+07 2.5E+07 3.0E+07\n\ny\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nInternal pressure (Pa)\n\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n1.35E+07 1.40E+07 1.45E+07 1.50E+07 1.55E+07 1.60E+07 1.65E+07\n\ny\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nInternal pressure (Pa)\n\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n\n\n\n157 \n\n \n\nfriction between the pipeline and the soil, some of them, based on the imperfection amplitude \n\nequal to 0.50 m, are presented from Figure 111 to Figure 114.  \n\n \n\nFigure 111 \u2013 Post-buckling configurations for the coefficient of friction equal to 0.1. \n\n  \n\n(a) at the times 3.1 s and 3.3 s (b) at the times 3.1 s and 3.7 s \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nFigure 112 \u2013 Post-buckling configurations for the coefficient of friction equal to 0.5. \n\n  \n\n(a) at the times 3.2 s and 3.4 s (b) at the times 3.2 s and 3.8 s \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nFigure 113 \u2013 Post-buckling configurations for the coefficient of friction equal to 0.8. \n\n  \n\n(a) at the times 3.3 s and 3.5 s (b) at the times 3.3 s and 3.9 s \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\n-0.30\n\n0.00\n\n0.30\n\n0.60\n\n0.90\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50\n\ny\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nx (m)\n\nJust before the upheaval (tref)\nJust after the upheaval (tref + 0.2 s)\n\n* tref = 3.1 s\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50\n\ny\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nx (m)\n\nJust before the upheaval (tref)\nPost-buckling configuration (tref + 0.6 s)\n\n* tref = 3.1 s\n\n-0.30\n\n0.00\n\n0.30\n\n0.60\n\n0.90\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50\n\ny\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nx (m)\n\nJust before the upheaval (tref)\nJust after the upheaval (tref + 0.2 s)\n\n* tref = 3.2 s\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50\n\ny\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nx (m)\n\nJust before the upheaval (tref)\nPost-buckling configuration (tref + 0.6 s)\n\n* tref = 3.2 s\n\n-0.30\n\n0.00\n\n0.30\n\n0.60\n\n0.90\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50\n\ny\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nx (m)\n\nJust before the upheaval (tref)\n\nJust after the upheaval (tref + 0.2 s)\n\n* tref = 3.3 s\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50\n\ny\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nx (m)\n\nJust before the upheaval (tref)\nPost-buckling configuration (tref + 0.6 s)\n\n* tref = 3.3 s\n\n\n\n158 \n\n \n\nFigure 114 \u2013 Post-buckling configurations for the coefficient of friction equal to 1.0. \n\n  \n\n(a) at the times 3.3 s and 3.5 s (b) at the times 3.3 s and 3.9 s \n\nSource: prepared by the author. \n\n \n\nIt is possible to observe that, for the same load increase from the buckling critical \n\nloads, the post-buckling configurations are practically the same, with few variations.

The \n\nconcept of effective axial force was addressed with details, since it is, from a global point of \n\nview, the fundamental parameter to understand the effects of the pressure in pipelines and why \n\nthey can buckle under the action of the pressure load. Analytical and numerical studies related \n\nto the buckling of pipelines itself were also presented in order to describe the mechanism of \n\nbuckling and the parameters that can influence it, especially with regard to the buckling critical \n\nload. Such studies played a fundamental role in the elaboration and understanding of the \n\nnumerical models developed by the present work. The study of Taylor and Tran (1996), for \n\nexample, which addresses the buckling of pipelines laid on prop imperfections, was the basis \n\nof comparison for the numerical results.  \n\nThrough the works analyzed, it was possible to verify that the buckling \n\nphenomenon that occurs in HPHT pipelines is quite complex and depends on many variables, \n\nsuch as: the pipeline geometry, the pipeline material, the process of laying the pipeline on the \n\nsoil, the pipeline layout on the soil, the load that acts on the pipeline, the soil profile and its \n\nimperfections, the soil properties, the adoption of buckling mitigating measures, etc. So, with \n\nthis initial contextualization of the subject, it was possible to delimit the scope of the present \n\nwork, identifying the gaps that it sought to fill. Considering the small number of studies that \n\ndeal exclusively with the internal pressure load in the context of buckling of pipelines, the \n\ngeneral objective of the present work was to analyze the upheaval instability of pipelines \n\ntriggered by the internal pressure, studying basically three parameters that can affect the \n\nphenomenon: the application of the internal pressure, the soil prop imperfections and the \n\nfriction between the pipeline and the soil. The discussions promoted here were based on the \n\nresults obtained from numerical models developed in Giraffe, having, as mentioned, the support \n\nof the analytical studies. The numerical models, unlike the analytical ones, considered large \n\ndisplacements and finite rotations. The assumptions of rigid soil (when it was modeled) and \n\nelastic-linear behavior of the pipeline material, in their turn, were maintained.  \n\nBeing the focus of the work, the internal pressure was applied in two different \n\nways in the numerical simulations. The first approach consisted in the application of an \n\nequivalent compressive axial force that produced the same effective axial force as that produced \n\nby the internal pressure. So, this axial force was not obtained by the integration of the stresses \n\non the pipeline cross section, as could be done, for example, to determine the effect of the \n\n\n\n160 \n\n \n\ntemperature load. The consideration of the axial force was made from Eq. (188), based on \n\nSparks (1984) and Fyrileiv and Collberg (2005). Besides this, both follower and non-follower \n\nbehaviors of the axial force were addressed in the analyses. The second approach for applying \n\nthe internal pressure was equivalent to the integration of the internal pressure on the internal \n\narea of the pipeline. It is worth mentioning, however, that Eq. (190) was used as a distributed \n\nload dependent on pipeline curvature and equivalent to internal pressure action, following the \n\nresults obtained by Gay Neto, Pimenta and Martins (2017), which is especially advantageous \n\nfor computation purposes. \n\nConcerning the numerical simulations, they were divided into two groups, which \n\nwere basically differentiated by their objectives and by the boundary conditions of the pipelines \n\nsimulated in Giraffe. The first group, presented in Section 5.2, consisted in geometrically-\n\nsimple models that represented only the pipeline, through Timoshenko beam elements, with \n\ndifferent boundary conditions at the pipeline ends, but with no consideration of the interaction \n\nbetween the pipeline and the soil. The objective of such models was to discuss the mechanisms \n\nfor modelling and analyzing the buckling phenomenon. In other words, the intention of the \n\nmodels of Section 5.2 was to verify and discuss the equivalence between the aforementioned \n\napproaches for considering the internal pressure, besides discussing two methods for obtaining \n\nthe structural response to the internal pressure: static and dynamic analyses. It is clearly a \n\nnumerical application of the theoretical discussions about stability of structures made in Section \n\n3.  \n\nThe effect of imperfections in the instability of pipelines subjected to internal \n\npressure was also analyzed in Section 5.2 in terms of post-buckling configurations and \n\nequilibrium paths/time-series of displacement. In general, the conclusion, corroborating the \n\nresults of the researches presented in Section 2, is that, for small imperfections, the critical \n\ninternal pressures tend to the critical internal pressures obtained analytically for perfect \n\npipelines. If the imperfections increase, the critical internal pressures decrease. With regard to \n\nthe equivalence between the approaches of application of internal pressure, the conclusion is \n\nthat, applying the internal pressure as internal pressure properly speaking or applying the \n\ninternal pressure as an equivalent follower compressive axial force, the results generated are \n\nthe same both for post-buckling configurations and equilibrium paths/time-series of \n\ndisplacement.  \n\nThe conclusions presented for the analyses of Section 5.2 apply both for the \n\nresults obtained from static and dynamic analyses, if such methods of analysis are employed \n\nproperly, that is, if the methods of analysis are compatible with the physical systems analyzed. \n\n\n\n161 \n\n \n\nIt is possible to say that the system nature depends on the boundary conditions and the load \n\napproaches. So, in general, the static analysis can be employed for conservative systems while \n\nthe dynamic analysis can also be employed for non-conservative systems as, for instance, \n\ncirculatory systems (case 4 of Section 5.2).  \n\nThe models described in Section 5.2 did not have the purpose of reproducing the \n\noperational conditions of real pipelines. This fact is clearly visible due to the boundary \n\nconditions imposed in the four cases analyzed, which restrain the movements only of the ends \n\nof the pipelines and ignore the restriction caused by the soil over their length. Thus, the \n\nsimulations performed are not compatible, and cannot be compared in quantitative terms of \n\nforces and displacements, with the results shown in Section 2. The main idea of the \n\ngeometrically-simple models, at such point of the research, was to understand and analyze the \n\nrole of the internal pressure in the global behavior of the structure concerning buckling, not \n\nworrying about other more complex influences. The best way for reaching this objective was \n\nto use known problems (Euler\u2019s columns) and apply the internal pressure, comparing the results \n\nobtained from the action of this pressure with the results obtained from the action of an \n\nequivalent axial force. As commented, this procedure allowed to draw conclusions about the \n\nbest way to apply the axial force with the objective of reproducing the global effects of the \n\ninternal pressure concerning the critical load and the post-buckling configuration. The \n\ndiscussion about the nature of the axial force required, by the way, a greater knowledge about \n\nstability of structures since, depending on how the load is applied and depending on the \n\nboundary conditions, the choice by a static or a dynamic analysis to evaluate the buckling may \n\nlead to results completely different. The stability of the pipeline, by the way, was also discussed \n\nin terms of the Lyapunov\u2019s first method, differentiating two types of instability: the divergence \n\nand the flutter. \n\nThe second group of simulations, presented in Section 5.3, involved more \n\nrealistic models, in which the interaction between the pipeline and the soil was addressed. The \n\nobjective of these models was to analyze the influence of the prop imperfection amplitude and \n\nof the friction between the pipeline and the soil in the buckling critical load and in the post-\n\nbuckling configuration of the pipeline, besides validating the formulation proposed by Gay \n\nNeto, Pimenta and Martins (2017), summarized by Eq. (190), in more complex models. This \n\nsecond group was divided into two subgroups of models. The first subgroup, which included a \n\nmore simplified model with the imperfection represented by a vertical concentrated force, had \n\nthe objective of verifying if the order of magnitude of the analytical results proposed by Taylor \n\nand Tran (1996) could be confirmed numerically in the model used. This verification proved \n\n\n\n162 \n\n \n\nthe compatibility of the results. In the second subgroup, in its turn, the imperfection is modeled \n\ntogether with the flat ground, being possible to detect it by the contact model described in \n\nSection 4.3. This subgroup allowed, in fact, to analyze the influence of the prop imperfection \n\namplitude and of the friction between the pipeline and the soil in upheaval buckling. As an extra \n\ndiscussion, the work presented interesting comparisons between the buckling that occurs in the \n\npresence of pointwise imperfections and the buckling that occurs in the presence of conformal \n\nimperfections, concluding that the latter are more favorable from an engineering point of view. \n\nConcerning the validation of the equivalence between the follower axial force \n\nand the internal pressure, the two load approaches produced compression in the pipeline and \n\nled to the buckling with the same critical loads, inducing even the same post-buckling \n\nconfigurations. Therefore, the equivalence between the two load approaches for the buckling \n\nanalysis is clearly evident. Such equivalence can be very useful in simpler and quicker analysis \n\nsuch as, for example, in those without friction, in which the use of the axial force can be made \n\ndirectly. The axial force can also be used in cases with friction, provided its consideration is \n\nincluded in Eq. (188), as proposed by Bai and Bai (2014). However, as the intention was to take \n\nthe advantage of the numerical analysis and to make the study of the buckling more general, \n\nonce the equivalence between the two load approaches has been proved, it was decided to apply \n\nthe internal pressure provided by Eq. (190) in the simulations with friction, which also \n\nrepresents more accurately the action of the load on the pipeline.  \n\nThrough the numerical analysis, it was observed again, as expected, a \n\ndependence between the amplitude of the prop imperfection and the buckling critical load: \n\nlarger amplitudes generate smaller critical loads than smaller amplitudes. It was shown, by the \n\nway, that this dependence is nonlinear (Figure 79). It is important to emphasize again that all \n\nnumerical analyses were geometrically nonlinear, considering large displacements and finite \n\nrotations, unlike the existing analytical models. It allowed to study the post-buckling \n\nconfigurations in a more coherent way. It was verified that the imperfection amplitude interferes \n\nin such post-buckling configurations: the same increase of load from the critical load, for the \n\ncases analyzed, generated the largest vertical displacements for the smallest imperfection \n\nstudied. With the increase of the imperfection amplitude, such displacements were smaller and \n\nvaried little from imperfection to imperfection. With respect to the influence of the friction, it \n\ncan be concluded that its increase delays the onset of the buckling and that its influence \n\ndecreases with the increase of the coefficient of friction, for a given imperfection amplitude. \n\nBesides this, for the cases studied, the friction had little influence, comparing to the influence \n\nof the imperfection amplitude, in the post-buckling configurations, when the pressure was \n\n\n\n163 \n\n \n\nincreased from the critical load. It is worth mentioning that the assumption of elastic-linear \n\nbehavior of the steel used in the pipeline was not confirmed for all cases, being necessary \n\nanalyses involving the plastic range of the steel for verifying possible differences in the results. \n\nIn general, it was possible to confirm many results obtained by previous authors. \n\nThis is because, whenever possible, the present work sought to compare its numerical results \n\nto the results obtained by Taylor and Tran (1996), making the necessary adaptations. A \n\ndifference of the present work compared to the other works is the causative load of the buckling \n\nthat, as mentioned, was the internal pressure. The isolated application of this load and the \n\npresenting of the results in terms of pressure, as well as the comparison between the different \n\napproaches for applying such load in the sphere of buckling, do not have much previous \n\ndiscussion. The use of an enhanced numerical model for this aim can also be counted as novelty. \n\nSuch formulations, as, for example, that proposed by Gay Neto, Pimenta and Martins (2017), \n\nby the way, had their applicability and efficiency proved. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n164 \n\n \n\n7 CONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\nThe present work discussed the upheaval buckling phenomenon that occurs in \n\npipelines considering the internal pressure separately, as the only triggering for buckling. \n\nThrough the research, some conclusions were obtained, which are summarized below: \n\n \n\na)  there is an equivalence between applying the internal pressure as a distributed load \n\nthat is dependent on pipeline curvature (GAY NETO; PIMENTA; MARTINS, 2017) and as a \n\nfollower compressive axial force, both in terms of critical loads and post-buckling \n\nconfigurations; \n\nb)  the numerical models proved the applicability of the formulation proposed by Gay \n\nNeto, Pimenta and Martins (2017) in a real context, obtaining results coherent with previous \n\nanalytical models; \n\nc)  the use of static or dynamic analysis to study buckling depends on the nature of the \n\nphysical system; \n\nd) as predicted by previous works, the critical load decreases with the increase of the \n\nprop imperfection amplitude and increases with the increase of the coefficient of friction \n\nbetween the pipeline and the soil; \n\ne)  the enhanced numerical model employed in the simulations allowed to predict \n\nsuitably the post-buckling configurations, since large displacements and finite rotations were \n\nconsidered, which can be very important to study the failure modes resulting from buckling; \n\nf)  besides some results known in the literature, it is possible to say that the imperfection \n\namplitudes analyzed played a more important role in the post-buckling configurations of the \n\npipeline than the friction between the pipeline and the soil; \n\ng)  the prop imperfections induced smaller critical loads than the conformal \n\nimperfections analyzed. \n\n \n\nThe subject of the present work has a wide range of possible future researches. \n\nIt is possible to replicate the study for the lateral buckling or even simulate numerically the \n\nchoice of the type of buckling, that is, verify which type naturally occurs. Advanced \n\nconsiderations about the soil deformability, as well as the inclusion of multiple imperfections, \n\nare also worth of investigation. The assumption of plasticity for the constitutive equation of the \n\nsteel used in the pipeline can be included in the models in order to verify if there are significant \n\nmodifications in the results obtained herein for higher levels of loading. Finally, with respect \n\n\n\n165 \n\n \n\nto the loads, the external and internal hydrostatic pressures can be included.
