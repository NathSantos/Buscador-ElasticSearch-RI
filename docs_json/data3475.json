The method is based on the coulometric determination of the\ntarnishing rate of pure silver. The results were compared with the method of pararosaniline, which\nis being currently used in some of the studied sites for the determination of SO2. The results obtained\nshowed a good correlation between the coulometric method and the pararosaniline method, when\nonly SO2 is present, as usually is the case of urban atmospheres. When H2S is also present, as in the\ncase of industrial areas, the methodology tends to strongly overestimate SO2 concentration.\n\nKeywords: coulometric method, tarnishing of Ag, urban pollution, SO2, H2S\n\nJ.

Guest editor: Luis\nAlberto Avaca.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBesides suspended particles, gaseous compounds, such\nas carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulfur\ndioxide (SO2), are normally the main atmospheric pollut-\nants in urban areas1, 2. Previous studies showed that in\nPorto Alegre- RS, approximatly 3.7 tons of SOx are daily\nemitted. Further 3.4 tons of SOx per day are produced in the\nindustrial metropolitan area around the city3.\n\nThe main SO2 source in urban areas is commonly\naccepted as resulting from the use of fossil fuels. In warm\nregions like Southern Brazil, the main source should be\nattributed to the transport activity and to the use of Diesel\n\noil. Due to local variations in the traffic density and in the\nwind velocity in a city, a local monitoring of SO2 is more\nadequate to identify critical areas, which are harmful to the\nhuman health and are also very corrosive to metals, stones\nand concrete structures.\n\nThe aim of the present study was to develop a method\nfor the determination of atmospheric SO2 content. The\nmethod should be inexpensive and simple, making pos-\nsible the local determination of the mean concentration in\nseveral points in an urban area. As showed below, the tar-\nnishing rate of silver shows the desired characteristics for\nan indicator of the SO2 concentration.\n\nPure silver, when exposed to H2S or SO2, forms a tar-\nnishing layer consisting only of achantite (alpha Ag2S).\nThis sulfide has an extremely low solubility product in\nwater, Kps=1 10-50 mol L-1 3,4 and is very conductive and\nadherent to the silver surface, enabling its coulometric de-\ntermination after the atmospheric exposure of silver3, 5.\n\n\n\n160 Silva et.al J. Braz. Chem. Soc\n\nMoreover, due to the high mobility of Ag+ ions in the\nAg2S salt, the tarnishing rate is time independent for tar-\nnishing layers up to several microns thick, being directly\nproportional to the H2S and SO2 concentrations5. As an\nexample, the tarnishing rate of Ag in 1ppm H2S, which is\nhigher than the one in SO2, remains controlled by surface\nreaction for several days6, 7.\n\nThe results presented here were measured during the\nsouthern hemisphere summer of 1999 in three urban points\nof Porto Alegre- RS, showing heavy traffic, where only\nSO2 is expected, and also in two sites near an oil refinery,\nwith different distances from a H2S source. An increasing\nSO2/H2S concentration ratio is expected here for greater\ndistances from the H2S source, resulting from the oxida-\ntion of H2S to SO2 during its transport from the source to\nthe measuring site. A long-term study is now under way to\ndetermine the influence of traffic intensity and climate\nparameters in the correlation between the coulometric and\npararosaniline methods.\n\nExperimental\n\nFor the coulometric determination of tarnishing rates,\ncoupons of pure silver (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99% Ag) with\ngeometric areas between 5 and 6 cm2 were cut and provided\nwith a 0.5 mm diameter hole. After vacuum annealing\n(650 \u00b0C  h-110-2 atm) the coupons were polished on both\nsides with emery paper up to 2400 mesh and degreased in\nethanol. For the atmospheric exposure, the coupons were\nhanged by a PTFE thread in the vertical position at five \u201cmoni-\ntoring stations\u201d, where a good ventilation and rain protection\nwere provided, and also other atmospheric data were being\ncollected. Three monitoring stations were located in down-\ntown sites, with dense traffic, Rodovi\u00e1ria, Borges and Azenha.\nAmong these sites, Rodovi\u00e1ria, where the Central Bus Sta-\ntion is located, shows usually the highest SO2 emissions. The\nother two monitoring stations were located at 19 km far from\ndowntown of Porto Alegre- RS, at the oil refinery \u201cRefinaria\nAlberto Pasqualine-Petrobras\u201d, namely REFAP1 and REFAP2.\nThe station REFAP1 lied 750 m far from an H2S-SO2-source,\nand REFAP2, respectively 1,500 m. At three of these stations,\nRodovi\u00e1ria, REFAP1 and REFAP2, SO2 was also collected\nand the concentration determined by the pararosaniline\nmethod as described in the appropriate norm8. The expo-\nsures were proceeded from January to March 1999. The mean\nrelative humidity and temperature during this period were\n79.4% and 24.9 \u00baC respectively, as determined for Porto\nAlegre- RS by the local state climate station.\n\nAfter exposure for different times, the Ag coupons were\nrinsed with water and acetone and reduced potentiodynami-\ncally in a standard three electrodes cell. The electrolyte was a\n\nborate buffer of pH 10 (3.092 g L-1 H3BO3, 3.728 g L-1 KCl,\n1.756 g L-1 NaOH), with addition of small quantities of Na2S\nand purged previously for 8 h with N2. Good results were\nobtained for sweep velocities in the negative direction of  0.1\nmV s-1, starting from the Ag2S/Ag equilibrium potential. This\nlow sweeping rate was necessary to avoid the superposition\nof the Ag2S reduction peak and the current related to the\nhydrogen evolution reaction. The equilibrium potential\n(Ag2S/Ag) was determined by a previous potentiodynamic\nsulfidation and reduction of a blank Ag probe in the same\nsolution. The potentials were measured against an AgCl/Ag\nreference electrode in 3.5 mol L-1 KCl, but are referred in the\ntext to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). After data ac-\nquisition by computer, the mass of Ag2S per area was calcu-\nlated from the charge density under the observed cathodic\npeak, assuming Ag2S as the only tarnishing product and sub-\ntracting the charge related to the background current density.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nThe voltammograms of the reduction of the exposed\nAg coupons are shown in Figures from 1 to 5. A sharp\nreduction peak in the range between E(Ag2S/Ag) and \u2013\n200 mV more negative than this, i.e (from \u2013350 to 550\nmV) is always observed. The peak current density grows\nwith the exposure time, and it can be attributed undoubt-\nedly to the reduction of the environmentally formed Ag2S.\nNo reduction peaks could be observed for unexposed Ag\nsamples. The background current density, measured on\nunexposed samples, or estimated on exposed samples as\nthe current minimum between the Ag2S peak and the hy-\ndrogen evolution region, ranged between 0.2 and 1\u00b5A cm-2,\nindicating the reduction of residual O2 dissolved in the elec-\ntrolyte. The coupons exposed at urban sites, i.e. Rodovi\u00e1ria,\nBorges and Azenha, (Figures 1-3, respectively) showed less\npronounced reduction peaks, comparing to the ones ex-\nposed at the oil refinery sites, REFAP1 and REFAP2 (Fig-\nures 4 and 5). For exposures at the less aggressive sites\nBorges and Azenha, a clear identification of the reduction\npeaks, at a potencial sweep rate of 0.1 mV s-1 was only pos-\nsible for exposure times of ca. 10 days or longer. For the\nmore aggressive sites at the refinery, clear peaks were al-\nready identified after seven days of exposure.\n\nSamples exposed for more then 20 days at the most\naggressive sites showed a second reduction peak (Figure\n1, 4, 5). Its current density, subtracting the background\ncurrent, grows with time of exposure and with the\naggressivity of the atmosphere, and its current was allways\nless than 3% of the main Ag2S peak. A second reduction\npeak was also observed by the reduction of Ag samples tar-\nnished strongly in aqueous sulfide solutions of 0.01mol L-1\n\n\n\nVol. 11 No. 2, 2000 Development of a Coulometric Method 161\n\n1.1km apart in downtown Porto Alegre (Borges and\nRodovi\u00e1ria). Moreover, for a distance of 2.5 km from the\nH2S-S02 source at the refinery, the atmosphere is still 4.25\ntimes more aggressive than the most polluted site identi-\nfied in downtown Porto Alegre, i.e. Rodovi\u00e1ria.\n\nThe comparison between the Ag tarnishing rate and the\nmean SO2 concentration as determined by daily measure-\nments during the same period with the pararosaniline\nmethod is presented in Figure 7. Using the data from the\ntwo sites where only SO2 is expected (Rodovi\u00e1ria and\nREFAP2) a ratio between the SO2 concentration and the\nAg tarnishing rate of 86\u00b14g SO2 m-3/g Ag2S cm-2 day-1.\nFor the site REFAP1, where H2S is also present, a 4 times\nsmaller ratio is found. This is certainly due to a much higher\nAg tarnishing rate in H2S than in SO2. The coulometric\n\nFigure 1.

Even so, it points\nout that the site REFAP1 has a much more aggressive at-\nmosphere than REFAP2. The pararosaniline method, cur-\nrently in use, indicated a SO2 concentration 1.5 times higher\nat the most distant point from the source than at a closer\none.

When\nH2S is also present, as in industrial areas, an over estima-\ntion of the SO2 concentration is expected, as the method\ncan not separate the effect of these two species. At least\none week is necessary till the presence of SO 2 can be de-\ntected in urban sites. Due to its low cost and simplicity, the\nmethod is more adequate for the local determination of\nlong term average concentrations of SO2.\n\nmV s-1\n\nE/mV NHE\n\nc\nm\n\n-2\n\nTime / days\n\nR e l a t i v i t y  H u m i d i t y  R U  /  %\n\nSO2 m -3 air\n\n c\nm\n\n-2\n d\n\na\ny-\n\n1\n\n\n\nVol. 11 No. 2, 2000 Development of a Coulometric Method 163\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe Secretaria Municipal do Meio Ambiente from the\nCity of P orto Ale gre and the company REFAP-\nPETROBRAS are gratefully acknowledged for technical\nsupport.
