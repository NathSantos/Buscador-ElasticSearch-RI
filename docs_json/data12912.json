The need to\nrethink this issue and reconstitute a series of\nfactors involved in homicides led us to focus on\nprimary data to correlate education, socializa-\ntion (gender cultures), delinquency, interper-\nsonal relations, and social conditions. In our\nopinion, other factors (biological and intra-psy-\nchological ones, among others) merit attention,\nbut in this study we adopted a gender culture\nperspective and the analytical possibilities of\nthe gender concept as defined by the Anglo-Sax-\non literature.\n\nMortality from external causes is defined as\nthe sum of homicides, suicides, and fatal acci-\ndents. Deaths from external causes are not dis-\ntributed equally between males and females. Ac-\ncording to the statistics consulted in this study,\nviolent deaths occur predominantly among\nmales (some 80% of the total in Porto Alegre\nfrom 1990 to 1997).\n\nMortality distribution by gender shows males\nwith external causes as the third most common\ncausal category every year except 1998, when\nrespiratory tract diseases occupied third place.\nAmong females, external causes were the fourth\nmost common category only in 1990 and were\nfifth in 1980, 1985, and 1995. These deaths also\nvaried as to the basic cause, with traffic accidents\nas the main cause among females, unlike males,\nin whom homicides were the main cause (Secre-\ntaria Municipal de Sa\u00fade de Porto Alegre, 1999).\n\nThe first phase of this study was conducted\nusing secondary statistical data from the State\nSecretariat for Health and the Environment (SS-\nMA) and the Porto Alegre Municipal Health Sec-\nretariat (SMS) to construct a historical series of\nhomicides among adolescents in the 1990s, al-\nlowing for an assessment of the magnitude of\nthis cause of death in the Porto Alegre popula-\ntion (Secretaria Municipal de Sa\u00fade de Porto\nAlegre, 1999). The second stage of the study fo-\ncused on the year 1997; we conducted an in-\ndepth study of the 68 teenage homicides that\n\noccurred that year, with a reconstitution of the\nlife history of these adolescents. Note that the\ncomplete statistics are not presented in this ar-\nticle due to space limitations, but they are avail-\nable to interested readers.\n\nAccording to Anglo-Saxon authors, and Joan\nScott (1990) in particular, gender is a constitu-\ntive element in social relations based on per-\nceived differences between the sexes, and is the\nfirst form ascribing meaning to power relations.\nThe author emphasizes that changes in the or-\nganization of social relations always correspond\nto changes in representations of power, and that\nsuch changes do not necessarily take a single\ndirection, but involve four different situations:\nculturally constructed symbols, represented\nby modalities and their contexts; normative\nconcepts, expressed in religious, educational,\nscientific, political, and legal doctrines that de-\ntermine the meanings of male and female as\nthe product of a social consensus rather than a\nconflict; construction of gender not exclusively\nthrough the kinship situation but also through\neconomic and political organization; and final-\nly, subjective gender identity constructed from\nhistorically situated social organizations and\nrepresentations. Scott further highlights that\nthese four elements operate interdependently,\nbut not simultaneously, as reflections of each\nother, thus requiring historical research into\nthe relationships between them.\n\nAnother author who has studied gender and\nsocial inequities with an emphasis on epidemi-\nology is Breilh (1996), who identifies asymmet-\nrical gender relations as factors producing in-\nequity, related to cultural and historical issues\nin the sexual and biological differences between\nmen and women. The health/disease process\nin the male/female universe is constructed in\nthe midst of social contradictions and specific\nconditions in social reproduction. There are\npatterns between males and females that differ-\nentially expose individuals to the protective and\ndestructive processes influencing their health.\n\nThe homicide-related situations described in\nthis study are in a sense \u201ccompatible\u201d with what\nis socially legitimated as the standard for virili-\nty, since attributes related to physical strength,\ncourage, and tenacity, among others, constitute\na positive form of virile social identity (Lopes,\n1996). Such sex-related \u201cattributes\u201d constitute\nwhat we refer to as \u201cgenders\u201d and partially ex-\nplain the prevalence of homicides among males\nand the violence that is intimately related to re-\nlations of power and domination, making men\nvictims of their own actions.\n\nBreilh (1996) adds that violence is directly\nrelated to inequity, which can be influenced by a\n\n\n\nCad. Sa\u00fade P\u00fablica, Rio de Janeiro, 18(6):1509-1517, nov-dez, 2002\n\ncombination of three factors: economic oppres-\nsion, ethnic discrimination (including racial\ndiscrimination), and gender violence. \n\nWithin this context, we adopt other con-\ncepts capable of helping us \u201cdeal with\u201d the is-\nsues raised. We thus use the concept of \u201cvulner-\nability\u201d as defined by Lert (1996) as the variants\nconstituting the individual and collective di-\nmensions defining a risk situation. Thus, in this\nstudy, vulnerability is constituted by the variants\ncontributing to the context of violent deaths\namong adolescents. As for individual vulnera-\nbility, we high light the need to always contextu-\nalize it in reference to a situation, or to a given\nmoment within a given society.\n\nBased on this conceptual approach, what we\nrefer to as a \u201crisk situation\u201d is the set of factors\nor vulnerabilities which \u2013 from the point of view\nof public health \u2013 constitute the social facts\nand relations (especially gender relations) that\npredispose to violent deaths. Thus, this article\nadopts the definition of vulnerability according\nto the meaning of social risk of delinquency and\ndeath.\n\nMethodology\n\nDue to the complex, multidimensional nature of\nthe proposed analysis, we adopted a pluralistic\nmethodology capable of harboring perspec-\ntives that would allow for a multifaceted un-\nderstanding of the theme. This choice led us to\npropose an approach to what could be called a\ncombinative or hybrid terrain. From this same\nperspective, the methodological/analytical pro-\nposal used statistics for the analysis of quantifi-\nable data and content analysis to categorize and/\nor quantify the qualitative or discursive data.\n\nSeveral authors discuss the use of a hybrid\nmethodology. Cortes (1998) refers to the use of\nqualitative analysis as an adjunct or illustrative\nmethod in research that mainly uses quantita-\ntive analytical techniques or the combination\nof the two methodologies, without a clear pre-\ndominance of one over the other.\n\nWith regard to the joint utilization of quan-\ntitative and qualitative methods, Minayo (1992)\nargues that the quality of the facts and social\nrelations are their inherent properties and that\nquantity and quality are inseparable and inter-\ndependent, hence requiring the dissolution of\nquantitative/qualitative dichotomies.\n\nIn this study, the statistical analyses are fre-\nquently punctual, cannot be generalized, and\ncomprise an interpretative analytical frame-\nwork. They frequently highlight the broader sce-\nnario of the specific facts under investigation.\n\nHOMICIDES AMONG TEENAGERS: VULNERABILITY, SUSCEPTIBILITY, AND GENDER CULTURES 1511\n\nThe subjects of this study were adolescent\nhomicide victims from the year 1997 and their\nfamilies. Adolescence was defined according to\nthe Brazilian Ministry of Health as the age brack-\net from 10 to 19 years (CNPD, 1997).\n\nThe year 1997 was chosen during the pro-\nject\u2019s preparatory phase, in 1998, when the data-\nbase of the National Mortality Information Sys-\ntem (SIM) underwent a quality control process\nwhich allowed to work with these data.\n\nThe epidemiological demarcation for the\nstudy of external causes is the historical series\nfrom the 1990s and the case series for the year\n1997, since the study focused only on families\nwho had lost an adolescent child to homicide\nduring this historical cross-section. Fletcher et\nal. (1989) define a case series as a prevalence\nstudy in a group of individuals with a given dis-\nease or injury, held at a single moment in time.\nThis demarcation allowed for an exploratory\nstudy of the life and death histories of these\nadolescents. The seriation was longitudinal for\nthe 1990s and allowed for some comparisons.\n\nRelating to the 68 adolescent homicide vic-\ntims in 1997, 64 families were located. Eight\nfamilies refused to participate, and 57 inter-\nviews were actually conducted. Three address-\nes were not located, so families not found and\nthose which refused totaled 11 interviews not\nconducted, or 16.2% of the total sample. Semi-\ndirected structured interviews were held with\nthe families with the aid of a data collection in-\nstrument. The instrument consisted of closed\nand open questions. The closed questions pro-\nvided data for the socio-demographic and epi-\ndemiological analytical quantification, based\non the selected variables. The open questions\nwere structured to supplement the socio-de-\nmographic and epidemiological information,\nand based on the thematic categorizations. They\nallowed us to unveil, learn about, and under-\nstand the dynamics of the individual, family,\nand social factors that had exposed the adoles-\ncents to homicide. In short, they composed the\nvulnerability to homicide risk situations in the\nstudy group.\n\nConsidering the notions of vulnerability and\nrisk situation, the study variables were grouped\naccording to three dimensions: socio-economic\nprocesses of the adolescents and their families;\nthe adolescents\u2019 family processes; and the ado-\nlescents\u2019 individual processes.\n\nTo study the quantitative variables, a de-\nscriptive analysis of the data was performed,\nbased on simple frequency tables, central ten-\ndency and dispersion measures, and a propor-\ntional comparison test. The study also used ta-\nbles cross-analyzing the socioeconomic vari-\n\n\n\nSANT\u2019ANA, A. R. &amp; LOPES, M. J. M.1512\n\nCad.

This compari-\nson indicates a concentration of these events\nin neighborhoods characterized by adverse so-\ncial indicators.\n\nSince homicides have legal implications, in\norder to comply with ethical research princi-\nples we kept the identity of the research sub-\njects secret and guaranteed the information\u2019s\nconfidentiality. Families were informed verbal-\nly about the research objectives and received\nan Informed Consent form, requesting the in-\nterviewee\u2019s authorization and signature attest-\ning to his/her knowledge of the document\u2019s con-\ntent.\n\nResults\n\nGender, external causes, and homicides \u2013 \nsome data\n\nTable 1 shows that males were the main victims\nof homicides during the seven year period, al-\nthough there was a slight increase in homicides\namong females in all age brackets, especially\nfrom 10 to 19 years.\n\nHomicide rates among males showed a cer-\ntain regularity during the period studied, with\n\na slight decrease from 1994 onward. From 1990\nto 1997 the rates varied by 3.7%. Male homi-\ncides in the 10 to 19 year bracket varied by 7.6%.\nFor females, the rate varied 3.80% overall and\n7.70% in the 10 to 19 year bracket.\n\nIn Porto Alegre, all deaths from external\ncauses also occur predominantly in males, with\nsome 80% of the total during the study period.\nComparing Tables 1 and 2, the trend in the pro-\nportion of deaths from external causes in Porto\nAlegre is similar to that in the State of Rio Gran-\nde do Sul as a whole. However, in Porto Alegre\nmale and female deaths have increased in ab-\nsolute numbers since 1994, except for the years\n1996 and 1997, when deaths from external caus-\nes in women decreased by approximately 10%.\nAs shown in Table 2, 88% of homicides occurred\nin males in Porto Alegre, while inversely, female\nvictims were less than 12%. Specifically in 1993,\nless than 5% of all homicide victims were has\nfemales.\n\nIn the 10 to 19 year age bracket there was\nno variation in the proportion of homicides in\nmales and females until 1992. In 1993 there\nwere no female homicide victims, so the pro-\nportion of males was greater than in 1994, but\nin absolute numbers there was an increase of\n33% among male victims that year. The ab-\nsence of female homicide victims in 1993 may\nbe related to the inclusion of \u201cevents of inde-\nterminate intent\u201d among females, which in-\ncreased by 100% in 1993.\n\nDespite the higher proportion of homicides\namong males as compared to females, from 1995\nto 1996 there was a drop of 25% in deaths among\nmales and an increase of 80% in females. In\n1997, male homicide victims increased by ap-\n\nTable 1  \n\nProportional mortality from all external causes and from homicides in all age brackets, and homicides in the 10 to 19 year bracket, \n\nby gender.

The facts surrounding these\nmurders are different for men and women and\nare associated with cultural representations of\nsocial gender relations. This evidence can be\nobserved in the Tables.\n\nTable 4 shows the distribution of alleged mo-\ntives for homicides in males. The most frequent\nexplanations provided by families of victims\nwere \u201csenseless\u201d killing, followed by revenge,\ninvolvement with drugs, participation in rob-\nberies, and \u201cwipeouts\u201d (i.e., victims who were\nmurdered because they \u201cknew too much\u201d).\n\nIn the words of victims\u2019 families, \u201cdelin-\nquents\u201d appeared as the main perpetrators of\nhomicides committed against other males,\nfollowed by a variety of other aggressors, like\nstrangers, others, friends, relatives, and the po-\nlice, in that order.\n\nDeaths classified as \u201csenseless\u201d killings in-\nvolved arguments and fights at parties or in the\nneighborhoods, triggered by power struggles,\ndifferences of opinion between groups, or mur-\nders with no explanation whatsoever.\n\nIn one situation, a teenage boy had gone to\ncelebrate his birthday at a pizza joint. He was at-\ntacked while he was on his way home with a girl\ncousin. The situation illustrates what the moth-\ner defined as a senseless killing. According to\nher, \u201cMy son and niece were waiting at the bus\nstop and the Passo das Pedras bus was running\nlate, so they took the Leopoldina. And these kids\nstarted hitting on my niece in the bus, so my son\ndecided they should get off near an ATM, right?\n\nBut he could never have imagined that those\nthree guys would come after them. And getting\noff the bus... those kids came running after them.\nAnd I don\u2019t know how he reacted, I guess he just\nstood still and didn\u2019t run, just shouted. He just\nshouted for my niece to run. And he just stood\nthere. So one of those kids pulled a knife out of\nhis backpack and stabbed him. And a police-\nman who testified caught the kid, said that he\nsaw him when he still just had his hands up\nand... [weeping]\u201d (mother).\n\nThe interview describes a kind of unjustifi-\nable conduct on the aggressor\u2019s part in a situa-\ntion where the victim had played no active part\nin any crime. The circumstance surrounding his\ndeath illustrate an aggressive attitude in a power\nstruggle among males. Competition for \u201cwin-\nning behaviors\u201d consecrates such a male iden-\ntity. Proving one\u2019s manliness through socially\nconsecrated conduct based on intimidation and\nviolent acts is one such attitude.\n\nIn murder for revenge, the act is supposedly\n\u201cjustified\u201d by the victim\u2019s presumed participa-\ntion in the process. Many of these adolescent\nvictims had displayed violent attitudes, includ-\ning involvement in fights, physical aggression,\nand crimes against property and lives, provok-\ning in their aggressors a thirst for justice, config-\nured in an act of vengeance.\n\nThe stories of these homicides reveal these\nsituations and illustrate our analyses: \u201cSo on the\nday he died, a Tuesday, he\u2019d been at my house on\nMonday. He\u2019d been fighting with a guy, at a par-\nty, on New Year\u2019s Day, and he killed the guy. He\nkilled him. So 21 days after he\u2019d killed this boy\nwho lived nearby... his father killed him, this\nboy\u2019s father killed my kid\u201d (mother).\n\nAnother alleged motive for homicides in ado-\nlescents was involvement with drugs or drug\ndealers. Only males were exposed to this risk\nsituation, indicating a kind of conduct involving\nthe conquest of economic power, where \u201cillic-\nit\u201d conduct is associated with challenging the\nestablished order, besides highlighting the lack\nof job opportunities for poor Brazilian youths.\n\nOne victim\u2019s sister-in-law reported that the\ndrug traffic was this teenager\u2019s only alternative\nfor survival, fueling a climate of dispute, fear,\nand death: \u201c(...) reality? What can I say? He sold\ndrugs... he was involved with drugs. But he didn\u2019t\nkill anybody, wasn\u2019t hurting anybody. He was just\nhurting himself. I don\u2019t know what happened...\nthese gang things where they say so-and-so killed\nsomebody, or what\u2019s-his-name killed somebody\nelse. But he hadn\u2019t done anything. And he didn\u2019t\ndo anything. That was all he was doing [dealing\ndrugs], and even cried about it. He used to say to\nhis older brother, my husband, \u2018I do this to sur-\n\nTable 4  \n\nHomicide-related situation according to motives and aggressor based \n\non information from victims\u2019 families.\n\nMotives Aggressor\n\nUnknown Fights between friends Police\n\nGang fights Partner committed murder out Partner\nof jealousy\n\nVictims of robbery Participation in robbery Friends\n\nSenseless killing Abuse of power by police Others\n\nInvolvement with drugs Stray bullet Unknown\n\nFight over girlfriend Wipeout (victim \u201cknew too much\u201d)\n\nRevenge Homicide preceded by sexual violence\n\nSource: Primary data, Porto Alegre, 1999.\n\n\n\nHOMICIDES AMONG TEENAGERS: VULNERABILITY, SUSCEPTIBILITY, AND GENDER CULTURES 1515\n\nCad.

And it so happened that he was at a play\nselling... and then he called out to his brother.\nHe was drunk, high. He called, shouted... I don\u2019t\nknow if there was somebody chasing him, he was\nsuspicious... he called out to his brother, but his\nbrother didn\u2019t go to the door... just said his broth-\ner must be fooling around on the street. So when\nhis brother... his brother just heard the shots.\nWhen he heard the shots the whole thing had\nalready happened. When he got to the door the\nshooting had already happened. There wasn\u2019t\ntime. I don\u2019t know if it was a hit job... because\nthese things... who sells more... who sells less, you\nknow? In the \u2018hood... they think they have to...\nthey have to sell more, you know? I think that\nmust of been it, I don\u2019t know\u201d (sister-in-law).\n\nFights over women are also behind homi-\ncides. Keeping power over the turf is based on\ncontrolling the women, through the power over\nthe female body, and the women are not allowed\nto get emotionally involved with someone who\ndoes not belong to the group. \u201cHe killed my\nbrother because he was seeing a girl from the\nplace where he lived. Cause a lot of people from\nthere where this kid lives don\u2019t like people from\nour street. Cause since my brother lived here,\neven though he wasn\u2019t in any kind of trouble, he\nlived here on this street, right?\u201d (sister).\n\nOther situations, like gang fights, robberies,\nfights between friends, and \u201cwipeouts\u201d indicate\nthat vulnerability to homicide is characterized\nby a kind of \u201cmasculine\u201d conduct that involves\nconstructing and circulating in areas suscepti-\nble to these risks. Such kinds of conduct are \u201cex-\npected\u201d of males, imposing challenges and risks\non their physical integrity.\n\nFrom this perspective, according to Willis\n(1991:52), violence is one way of expressing\nmanhood, \u201cregulating a kind of honor\u201d. Accord-\ning to the author, it is a way of manifesting viril-\nity and maintaining group hierarchy.\n\nThis expression of manhood through vio-\nlence also occurs in the command over the fe-\nmale body. Motives for teenage homicides dif-\nfered between girls and boys. As shown in Table\n4, the main reason for homicides against girls\nwas \u201cjealousy\u201d on the part of the male partner\nor former partner, the perpetrator.\n\nSuch homicides against women also suggest\ngender cultures as explanatory attributes. The\nboyfriends of the three teenage girls had char-\nacteristics in common: they all had criminal\nrecords and had been involved in robberies,\nhomicides, and drug dealing. Their relation-\nship to the girls was one of possession, and the\nmurders all occurred when the females reacted\n\nunexpectedly to impositions on their own con-\nduct. As one mother reported, \u201cHe was very jeal-\nous, I mean sick, because he killed her out of jeal-\nousy. She had gone out to dance. He went up-\nstairs with her, she wasn\u2019t with him any more, she\nhad separated from him because of this child she\nhad to give away and because he was very jeal-\nous of her. He wanted her but he didn\u2019t want the\nchildren. He stalked her, came to our house, and\nkilled her\u201d (mother).\n\nSaffioti (1994) studied these situations and\nconcluded that public space is eminently mas-\nculine and that men are more exposed to vio-\nlence from other men in these places. Women\nsuffer violence in the private domain, and their\naggressors are generally former husbands, part-\nners, or boyfriends.\n\nBased on data from the Brazilian National\nCensus Bureau (IBGE) in 1988, 70% of the homi-\ncides perpetrated by men against women are\nrelated to the man\u2019s refusal to accept a separa-\ntion (IBGE, 1988). The circumstances involving\nthe three female teenagers in this study who\nwere killed by their [former] partners corrobo-\nrate these findings.\n\nCircumstances surrounding the murders\nof the other two teenage girls were as follows:\none was with a group that was playing Russian\nroulette, and since she voiced her opinion\nagainst this game, she was killed outright by one\nof the players; the other was raped and then\nmurdered. The latter case illustrates physical\nforce as an instrument of male power over the\nfemale body.\n\nThe mother\u2019s account of her teenage daugh-\nter\u2019s death confirms that her daughter had been\ndefenseless: \u201cSo he grabbed her and started\ndragging her away. They said the other girls saw\nit happening, like he threatened her. They said it\nwas a group [weeping]. They said he used a hunt-\ning rifle. And they said that... he did what he had\nto do, right. That he shot her in the head. She\nstarted to shout, to cry out for help. The police\nsaid the noise was muffled by a mattress and a\npillow so nobody would hear the shots. Then he\ntried to bury her, so no one would see\u201d(mother).\n\nRisk situations: vulnerability arguments\n\nTeenage deaths need to be related to the risk\nsituations to which these adolescents are ex-\nposed. Table 5 illustrates how these situations\noccur both with males and females and express\ngender susceptibility through involvement in il-\nlicit contexts.\n\nThe majority of the teenage girls who were\nmurdered consumed illicit drugs (60%). Among\nthe teenage boys, the proportion of drug users\n\n\n\nSANT\u2019ANA, A. R. &amp; LOPES, M. J. M.1516\n\nCad. Sa\u00fade P\u00fablica, Rio de Janeiro, 18(6):1509-1517, nov-dez, 2002\n\n(34.6%) was high, but not the majority, accord-\ning to the families. This information should be\ninterpreted with caution, since among males\nthere were ten cases in which their drug con-\nsumption was ignored by the family members\ninterviewed.\n\nIn this population group, only males used\nweapons, denoting an explicit attack-or-de-\n\nfend attitude. Males, unlike females, adhered\nmore frequently to the private use of all types of\nweapons, or gun use as a \u201csport\u201d.\n\nNo statistically significant difference was ob-\nserved in the variables among males and fe-\nmales based on whether the deceased had spent\ntime in FEBEM (the State Foundation for the\nWelfare of Minors, a government reformatory\nsystem) or had police records. However, in rela-\ntion to police records, males had participated in\nmore serious crimes, like robberies, drug traffic,\nassault, and homicides, while females tended to\nhave been involved in petty theft, for example.\n\nThese risk situations partially explain the\npredominance of homicides among males, since\nthese young men displayed attitudes that trig-\nger violence, thus becoming more exposed to\nthis outcome. Meanwhile, the vulnerability of\nthe five teenage girls who were murdered is re-\nlated to passive attitudes towards their aggres-\nsors, which is culturally expected of women and\noccurs more explicitly in the more vulnerable\nsocial strata. This relationship is confirmed by\nthe difference in plans for the future: 60% of the\nteenage girls (3/5) had no explicit ideals, unlike\nthe teenage boys, whose main life projects were\nto study and get ahead professionally. The two\nteenage girls who had plans for the future were\nfocused on more immediate situations (that is,\nthe near future), like work and consumer goals,\nlife changes, and dedication to family.\n\nThe involvement of teenage girls in violent\nsituations has reinforced the idea that their\nemotional ties to the male perpetrators still ac-\ncounts for their victimization. This attests to\nthe fact that the cultural basis of male-over-fe-\nmale domination continues to express itself in\nsymbols and life styles. This basis, far from pro-\ntecting \u201cmanhood\u201d, makes males susceptible\nand vulnerable to becoming aggressors and\naggressed. Without intending to fuel the de-\nbate on the supremacy of one gender over the\nother, we do wish to contribute to reflection and\nto highlight comprehensive elements for con-\nstructing a reality that will no longer reproduce\nsuch inequities.\n\nTable 5 \n\nDistribution of study population by gender and risk situations.
