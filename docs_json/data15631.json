Em virtude desse crescimento, o controle\nte?rmico de equipamentos eletro?nicos tem se tornado um assunto de importa?ncia para a\nindu?stria de eletro?nicos. Existe atualmente uma necessidade para desenvolver dispositivos\nde transfere?ncia de calor que sejam capazes de transferir grandes quantidades de calor a?\numa queda de temperatura m??nima. Neste contexto, os Heat Pipes (HP), os Loop Heat\nPipes (LHP) e os Capillary Pumping Loops (CPL) sa?o alternativas confia?veis e via?veis\npara a dissipac?a?o de calor gerado. Eles sa?o trocadores de calor, que utilizam a evaporac?a?o\ne condensac?a?o de um fluido de trabalho para transferir calor de forma mais eficiente. A\ncirculac?a?o de fluido e? realizada pelas forc?as capilares geradas em uma estrutura porosa.\nPortanto, o bombeamento do fluido de trabalho na?o consome energia ele?trica. Nesta tese,\napenas os LHPs e o CPLs sera?o estudados.\n\nNas u?ltimas de?cadas, a aceitac?a?o destes sistemas na comunidade aeroespacial vem\ncrescendo devido a suas vantagens de desempenho, caracter??sticas u?nicas de funciona-\nmento e ao sucesso obtido nos recentes experimentos testados no espac?o. Por con-\nseque?ncia, as pesquisas te?m se intensificado a fim de compreender melhor os feno?menos\nque ocorrem nestes sistemas te?rmicos. Ku &amp; Kroliczek (1987), Maydanik et al. (1991),\nKu (1994), Maydanik (1999), Ku (1999), Nikitkin &amp; Cullimore (1998), Chernysheva et al.\n(2007), Santos &amp; Bazzo (2007), entre outros, publicaram avanc?os passados e recentes na\npesquisa desses sistemas de controle te?rmico.\n\nObjetivo\n\nOs principais objetivos desta tese sa?o dois. O primeiro e? o desenvolvimento de um\nmodelo matema?tico para o problema da transfere?ncia de calor e de massa, que ocorre\ndentro do meio poroso de evaporadores de sistemas de bombeamento capilar. O segundo\ne? a aplicac?a?o de meios porosos cera?micos em sistemas de bombeamento capilar (LHPs e\nCPLs) seguido pela avaliac?a?o de seus comportamentos te?rmicos durante a partida e em\ncondic?o?es de regime permanente. A?gua e acetona sa?o utilizados como fluidos de trabalho.\n\npaulosantos\nRet\u00e2ngulo\n\n\n\nIntroduc?a?o\n\nClassificac?a?o e Operac?a?o Ba?sica dos CPLs e LHPs\n\nOs CPLs e LHPs operam dentro de um intervalo de temperatura, basicamente, definido\npelas propriedades do fluido de trabalho. A escolha do fluido de trabalho envolve va?rios\nfatores associados a? operac?a?o, disponibilidade e seguranc?a. A amo?nia e? frequ?entemente\nusada em sistemas de bombeamento capilar, mas outros fluidos de trabalho, tais como\na?gua, etanol, acetona, propileno, metanol, butano, isobutano e propano tambe?m apre-\nsentam um bom funcionamento (PETERSON, 1994). A faixa de temperatura de operac?a?o\ndetermina a condic?a?o preliminar para a selec?a?o do fluido de trabalho para uma deter-\nminada aplicac?a?o. A faixa ma?xima esta? compreendida entre os pontos triplo e cr??tico,\nporque abaixo do ponto triplo e acima do ponto cr??tico na?o ha? circulac?a?o do fluido de\ntrabalho por ac?a?o capilar.\n\nA capacidade de bombeamento capilar depende da tensa?o superficial do fluido de\ntrabalho e das propriedades do meio poroso. Ate? agora, os fluidos de trabalho foram\nclassificadas de acordo com o limite capilar, ou seja, de acordo com a pressa?o ma?xima de\nbombeamento que o meio poroso pode prover. Existe outro limite chamado de limite de\nebulic?a?o, mas por falta de uma melhor estrate?gia, os fluidos que apresentam este problema\nte?m sido evitados. O limite de ebulic?a?o esta? relacionado com o processo de evaporac?a?o\ndo fluido de trabalho no canal de alimentac?a?o de l??quido e/ou no meio poroso devido\na? alta temperatura do l??quido que escoa atrave?s do evaporador. Ku (1994) estudou o\nfuncionamento de um CPL, baseando a sua ana?lise no diagrama de pressa?o e temperatura\n(PT), e em suas concluso?es justifica a necessidade de um alto grau de sub-resfriamento\nna entrada do evaporador capilar exigido por alguns fluidos de trabalho, tais como a?gua\ne tolueno. Ou seja, quanto maior a exige?ncia de sub-resfriamento de um determinado\nfluido de trabalho, menor o limite de ebulic?a?o. Uma ana?lise similar realizada para o LHP,\nutilizando o diagrama PT, foi tambe?m publicada por Maydanik et al. (1991), Ku (1999)\nand Maydanik (2005). A ocorre?ncia destes dois limites operacionais sera?o analisados neste\ntrabalho.\n\nOs modos de operac?a?o dos sistemas de bombeamento capilar pode ser classificado\ncomo conduta?ncia fixa ou varia?vel. No modo de conduta?ncia varia?vel, a temperatura de\nsaturac?a?o do sistema pode ser controlada para diferentes cargas te?rmicas. Por outro lado,\nno modo de conduta?ncia fixa, quanto maior a carga te?rmica, maior sera? a temperatura\nde saturac?a?o do sistema. Nikitkin &amp; Cullimore (1998) apresentou gra?ficos qualitativos\nda temperatura do vapor para um CPL e um LHP, ambos operando nos modos de con-\nduta?ncia fixa e varia?vel. De forma semelhante, Chernysheva et al. (2007) apresentou\ngra?ficos quantitativos para um LHP. A pro?xima sec?a?o resume os principais resultados das\nrecentes pesquisas desenvolvida envolvendo a aplicac?a?o dos sistemas de bombeamento\ncapilar (CPLs e LHPs) no controle te?rmico de equipamentos eletro?nicos em geral.\n\nRevisa?o dos Experimentos Realizados com CPL e LHP\n\nO controle te?rmico tem crescido em importa?ncia na indu?stria eletro?nica (computa-\ndores modernos) devido a? cont??nua diminuic?a?o de tamanho e ao aumento na pote?ncia dos\nseus componentes. De acordo com Nikitkin &amp; Cullimore (1998) and Maydanik (2005), os\nLHPs e os CPLs, que foram desenvolvidos anteriormente para o controle te?rmico aeroes-\npacial (sate?lites), sa?o alternativas confia?veis e via?veis para transferir calor em grandes\n\n\n\nquantidades com alto desempenho tambe?m para aplicac?o?es em condic?o?es atmosfe?ricas.\nVa?rios autores (CHEN; LIN, 2001; HOANG et al., 2003; PASTUKHOV et al., 2003; MAYDANIK,\n2005; CHEN et al., 2006; PASTUKHOV; MAYDANIK, 2007) publicaram resultados experi-\nmentais relativos a? aplicac?a?o dos LHPs, mini-LHPs e CPLs na dissipac?a?o de calor em\nCPUs de computadores modernos, mostrando que eles sa?o trocadores de calor eficientes\ne confia?veis para a pro?xima gerac?a?o de microprocessadores.\n\nE? comum expressar a qualidade dos LHPs e CPLs atrave?s da resiste?ncia te?rmica R\n(oC/W) dada por,\n\nR =\n?T\n\nQ\n,\n\nonde Q e? a taxa de transfere?ncia de calor dissipada pelo sistema de bombeamento capilar\ne ?T e? a diferenc?a de temperatura entre as fonte quente e fria.\n\nO desempenho te?rmico e a confiabilidade dos LHPs e CPLs te?m sido extensivamente\nestudados experimentalmente. Ku (1999), Chen &amp; Lin (2001), Pastukhov et al. (2003),\nChuang (2003), Ku et al. (2004), Pastukhov &amp; Maydanik (2007), Maydanik &amp; Vershinin\n(2009) analisaram a partida e o comportamento te?rmico dos sistemas de bombeamento\ncapilar (CPL e LHP) com relac?a?o a? raza?o de preenchimento do fluido de trabalho, a?\ninclinac?a?o dos sistemas, ao material do meio poroso (n??quel, ac?o inoxida?vel, cobre, poli-\netileno), ao material do invo?lucro do evaporador (cobre e ac?o inoxida?vel), ao sistema de\nrefrigerac?a?o do condensador (a?gua e ar em convecc?a?o forc?ada e ar em convecc?a?o natural),\ncom multi-evaporadores e multi-condensadores. Os testes foram realizados em condic?o?es\natmosfe?ricas e de microgravidade para uma se?rie de cargas te?rmicas. Os resultados mais\nrecentes sa?o descritos a seguir.\n\nHoang et al. (2003) desenvolveram e testaram tre?s mini-LHPs que utilizavam propileno,\namo?nia e a?gua como fluidos de trabalho. Todos os LHPs foram assistidos por um sistema\nde resfriamento secunda?rio na ca?mara de compensac?a?o a fim de diminuir a transfere?ncia\nde calor da zona de evaporac?a?o para o canal de entrada de l??quido. Dois sistemas de res-\nfriamento na ca?mera de compensac?a?o foram testados: um sistema termo-ele?trico (TEC)\ne um tubo de calor feito de cobre com 3 mm de dia?metro, que utilizava a?gua como fluido\nde trabalho. Dois dos LHPs foram capazes de transportar calor ate? 60 W (amo?nia) e\n15 W (propileno) a? temperatura ambiente de 25 oC. O LHP que utilizou a?gua (principal\nobjetivo do trabalho) foi testado com e sem o tubo de calor na ca?mara de compensac?a?o.\nO LHP que utilizou a?gua foi feito de cobre e o meio poroso foi feito de teflon com dia?metro\nde poro de 7 \u00b5m e permeabilidade de 1 \u00d7 10?13 m2. Este LHP foi capaz de transportar\ncalor ate? 220 W a? uma temperatura de operac?a?o de 82 oC com o tubo de calor na ca?mara\nde compensac?a?o e 90 oC sem o tubo de calor. A resiste?ncia te?rmica total variou de 2, 0\na 0, 2 oC/W. A utilizac?a?o do tubo de calor na ca?mara de compensac?a?o teve uma grande\ninflue?ncia na capacidade de transfere?ncia de calor dos LHPs.\n\nSeis mini-LHPs foram desenvolvidos e testados por Pastukhov et al. (2003) para o res-\nfriamento de componentes eletro?nicos e processadores de computadores porta?teis. Amo?nia\ne acetona foram utilizadas como fluido de trabalho. Meios porosos feitos de ac?o inoxida?vel\ne tita?nio foram utilizados como estruturas porosas. O ar foi usado em convecc?a?o forc?ada\npara o resfriamento do condensador e do dia?metro dos evaporadores cil??ndricos variou de\n5 a 6 mm. Os LHPs foram capazes de transportar calor ate? 40 W com resiste?ncia te?rmica\ntotal variando de 1, 0 a 2, 4 oC/W. A temperatura do processador se manteve entre 83\ne 90 oC. Eles conclu??ram que uma maior diminuic?a?o da resiste?ncia te?rmica total deve\n\n\n\nser obtida pela otimizac?a?o do projeto do LHP e do resfriamento do condensador. Eles\nmostraram ainda que a amo?nia apresentou melhores resultados quando comparado com\nos resultados obtidos usando acetona.\n\nChen et al. (2006) realizaram uma se?rie de testes com um mini-LHP, o qual foi de-\nsenvolvido para refrigerac?a?o de CPUs de computadores porta?teis. Amo?nia foi utilizada\ncomo fluido de trabalho e o material do meio poroso foi feito de tita?nio com raio de poro\nde 17, 2 \u00b5m, porosidade de 78% e permeabilidade de 11, 5 \u00d7 10?12 m2. Eles testaram o\nmini-LHP em diversas posic?o?es (na horizontal, condensador acima do evaporador, evapo-\nrador acima do condensador, ca?mara de compensac?a?o acima do evaporador e evaporador\nacima da ca?mara de compensac?a?o), com destaque para a posic?a?o com o evaporador acima\ndo condensador em 10o e vice-versa. O comportamento te?rmico do mini-LHP foi avali-\nado durante a partida do sistema e para diferentes temperaturas do banho termosta?tico\nutilizado no condensador. A? temperatura do banho de 25 oC e na posic?a?o horizontal, o\nmini-LHP foi capaz de transportar calor ate? 70 W a uma temperatura de operac?a?o limite\nde 80 oC e a resiste?ncia te?rmica total variou de 0, 2 a 0, 85 oC/W. Eles conclu??ram que o\nmini-LHP testado na posic?a?o horizontal operou de maneira satisfato?ria.\n\nMaydanik &amp; Vershinin (2009) desenvolveram e testaram nove mini-LHPs com eva-\nporadores capilares cil??ndricos. Tre?s mini-LHPs tinham dia?metros externos de 5 mm e\nseis mini-LHPs tinham dia?metros externos de 6 mm. Eles utilizaram amo?nia como fluido\nde trabalho para todos os mini-LHPs e materiais diferentes para o meio poroso (tita?nio,\ncom raios me?dios de poro de 9, 5 e 17, 2 \u00b5m e porosidades de 70 e 78%, e n??quel com\nraios me?dios de poro variando entre 13, 5 e 10, 0 \u00b5m e porosidades de 71, 66 e 65%). Os\ninvo?lucros dos evaporadores cil??ndricos foram feito de tita?nio e n??quel. Va?rios testes foram\nrealizados com o objetivo de avaliar o comportamento te?rmico dos mini-LHPs levando em\nconsiderac?a?o a inclinac?a?o dos dispositivos, a temperatura de resfriamento na sec?a?o do\ncondensador e o tipo de fluido utilizado para o resfriamento do condensador (ar e a?gua\nem convecc?a?o forc?ada). Eles apresentaram uma metodologia para estimar as resiste?ncias\nte?rmica e os coeficientes de transfere?ncia de calor dos mini-LHPs. As resiste?ncias te?rmicas\nm??nimas foram 0, 53 oC/W e 0, 14 oC/W para o resfriamento do condensador com ar e\ncom a?gua, respectivamente. A capacidade ma?xima foi de 230 W para o resfriamento do\ncondensador com a?gua.\n\nComo demonstrado, a maioria dos meios porosos foram feitos de metais ou pol??meros.\nNo entanto, esses materiais apresentam algumas dificuldades de usinagem (meios porosos\nmeta?licos) e uma baixa capacidade de bombeamento capilar (meios porosos de pol??mero).\nA usinagem dos meios porosos meta?licos pode obstruir os poros na superf??cie, diminuindo,\ndesta forma, a permeabilidade do meio poroso. A pro?xima sec?a?o apresentara? alguns tra-\nbalhos nos quais foram realizadas a produc?a?o, a caracterizac?a?o e a aplicac?a?o de meios\nporosos em sistemas de bombeamento capilar.\n\nAplicac?a?o de Meios Porosos Cera?micos em Sistemas de Bombeamento\nCapilar\n\nEmbora a capacidade de transfere?ncia de calor dos LHPs e CPLs seja alta, a produc?a?o\ncomplicada desses dispositivos e? ainda uma desvantagem. A montagem adequada da\nestrutura capilar no interior do invo?lucro do evaporador e? o primeiro desafio a ser superado.\nA montagem e? relativamente complexa, porque para o bom funcionamento do evaporador\ncapilar se requer um micro-espac?amento entre as paredes internas do invo?lucro meta?lico\ne a superf??cie externa do meio poroso. Este espac?amento deve ser adequado a fim de\n\n\n\nminimizar a resiste?ncia te?rmica e qualquer vazamento de vapor do evaporador para a\nca?mara de compensac?a?o (LHP) ou para o canal de alimentac?a?o de l??quido (CPL). A fim\nde se obter esses micro-espac?amentos, um processo de usinagem confia?vel e? necessa?rio para\nas estruturas porosas meta?licas, porque ha? a possibilidade de obstruc?a?o dos poros na sua\nsuperf??cie devido a? deformac?a?o pla?stica. Os meios porosos cera?micos na?o apresentam essa\ndeformac?a?o pla?stica durante a usinagem. Portanto, eles podem ser usinados utilizando\nma?quinas convencionais (JANSSEN et al., 2008).\n\nDe acordo com o conhecimento do autor desse trabalho, existem poucos sistemas de\nbombeamento capilar usando meios porosos cera?micos (RASSAMAKIN et al., 2002; RHI,\n2006). A maioria dos LHPs e CPLs usam meios porosos de polietileno ou de metal.\nEspera-se que os meios porosos cera?micos se tornem mais vantajosos porque eles sa?o\nmenos onerosos e de fa?cil usinagem, pois na?o corre o risco de obstruir os poros da superf??cie\nexterna da estrutura por deformac?a?o pla?stica. Ale?m disso, a baixa condutividade te?rmica\npode minimizar a transfere?ncia de calor radial para o canal de alimentac?a?o de l??quido,\nevitando que o limite de ebulic?a?o seja atingido.\n\nReimbrecht (2004) desenvolveu uma metodologia para a fabricac?a?o de meios porosos\npara aplicac?a?o em sistemas de bombeamento capilar. Va?rias te?cnicas - ana?lise de imagem,\nporosimetria atrave?s da intrusa?o de mercu?rio e outros me?todos experimentais - foram\nempregadas para determinar as propriedades esta?ticas e de transporte dos meios porosos\nestudados. Ele produziu meios porosos meta?licos (n??quel e ac?o inoxida?vel) e cera?micos.\n\nCamargo (2004) testou e analisou todos os meios porosos fabricado por Reimbrecht\n(2004) em CPLs. Duas bancadas experimentais foram constru??das para avaliar os CPLs\nproduzidos. Ele testou os CPLs com acetona e amo?nia como fluido de trabalho. Os\nresultados apresentados por Camargo (2004), mostraram que o CPL com o meio poroso\ncera?mico obteve sucesso na partida apenas para a carga te?rmica de 10 W, entretanto ele\nna?o operou de forma esta?vel. Ale?m disso, o CPL com o meio poroso cera?mico apresentou\nos piores resultados de desempenho quando comparados com os outros meios porosos\ntestados (n??quel, ac?o inoxida?vel e polietileno).\n\nBerti (2008) fabricou e testou dois CPLs que utilizaram acetona como fluido de tra-\nbalho. Um CPL testado utilizava um meio poroso cera?mico fabricado por colagem por\nbarbotina, que operou com uma carga te?rmica de 40 W (3.93 W/cm2). O outro CPL tes-\ntado que utilizava tambe?m um meio poroso cera?mico, mas que foi fabricado por biomode-\nlagem, operou com uma carga te?rmica de 20 W (11.32 W/cm2). Os CPLs funcionaram de\nforma satisfato?ria, pore?m Berti (2008) relatou que ele teve muitos problemas em relac?a?o a?\nmontagem do evaporador capilar e a? transfere?ncia de calor atrave?s da parede do evapora-\ndor para o canal de alimentac?a?o de l??quido, devido a? geometria usada para os evaporadores\ncapilares planos.\n\nA sec?a?o seguinte apresentara? uma breve revisa?o bibliogra?fica dos modelos matema?ticos\npropostos para resolver o problema da transfere?ncia de calor e de massa em evaporadores\ncapilares.\n\nDescric?a?o e Revisa?o do Problema\n\nO principal componente de sistemas de bombeamento capilar (CPL e LHP) e? o evapo-\nrador capilar. Durante a operac?a?o dos evaporadores capilares, calor e? aplicado a superf??cie\nexterna do evaporador e do fluido de trabalho dentro do meio poroso muda de fase. O\nvapor gerado no evaporador escoa atrave?s das ranhuras. A evaporac?a?o do fluido de tra-\n\n\n\nbalho dentro dos evaporadores capilares depende da carga te?rmica aplicada ao sistema e\npode ocorrer em tre?s regimes distintos: (1) evaporac?a?o em microfilme (2), evaporac?a?o na\nsuperf??cie externa do meio poroso e (3) evaporac?a?o dentro do meio poroso.\n\nA incerteza com relac?a?o a? localizac?a?o da frente de evaporac?a?o e a? determinac?a?o dos\nlimites capilares para a operac?a?o do meio poroso te?m motivado tentativas para se re-\nsolver o problema da transfere?ncia de calor e de massa em meios porosos de sistemas de\nbombeamento capilar. Alguns dos modelos teo?ricos sa?o analisados a seguir.\n\nCao &amp; Faghri (1994a) estudaram a evaporac?a?o em meios porosos supondo condic?o?es\nde contornos restritivas, que, no entanto, resultou em soluc?o?es anal??ticas para os campos\nde velocidade e temperatura. Eles assumiram que o meio poroso estava completamente\nsaturado de l??quido e a frente para a evaporac?a?o estava localizada na superf??cie externa.\nSeu modelo tambe?m assume que o campo de velocidade e? uniforme na entrada de l??quido\ne na sa??da de vapor. Eles fizeram uma ana?lise parame?trica direcionada, principalmente,\npara mostrar que a sua soluc?a?o anal??tica e? precisa para a maioria das aplicac?o?es. Eles\nconclu??ram que os resultados obtidos sa?o de releva?ncia para o projeto de evaporadores\ncapilares.\n\nCao &amp; Faghri (1994b) publicaram uma extensa?o de seu trabalho anterior fazendo uma\nana?lise da geometria tridimensional. Um estudo nume?rico foi desenvolvido para estudar\no fluxo do l??quido atrave?s do meio poroso (bidimensional) e o fluxo de vapor atrave?s\ndas ranhuras (tridimensional). Uma comparac?a?o entre os resultados e? apresentada para\ntre?s fluidos de trabalho (a?gua, freon e amo?nia). Em ambos os trabalhos publicados por\nCao e Faghri, eles afirmam que os resultados obtidos sa?o de releva?ncia para o projeto de\nevaporadores capilares, pore?m eles na?o apresentam um crite?rio para a secagem do meio\nporoso, ou seja, eles na?o determinam qual seria o fluxo de calor cr??tico antes da falha do\nevaporador capilar.\n\nDemidov &amp; Yatsenko (1994) realizou uma ana?lise teo?rica sobre o problema da trans-\nfere?ncia de calor e de massa em meios porosos de um sistema de bombeamento capilar.\nEm seu modelo, o l??quido dentro do meio poroso muda de fase, desenvolvendo uma regia?o\nde vapor saturado separada da regia?o de l??quido saturado por uma frente de evaporac?a?o.\nSa?o aplicadas as equac?o?es de conservac?a?o da massa e da energia na frente de evaporac?a?o.\nA pressa?o capilar tambe?m e? modelada nesta frente. Uma soluc?a?o nume?rica do mod-\nelo matema?tico permitiu estudar o deslocamento da frente de evaporac?a?o em func?a?o da\nvariac?a?o da carga te?rmica aplicada ao sistema.\n\nEles assumiram que duas condic?o?es limites sa?o fisicamente poss??vel. Para fluxos de\ncalor baixos, existe uma pequena regia?o de vapor saturado abaixo da aleta e ocorre a\nformac?a?o de meniscos de liquido na interface meio poroso-aleta. Toda a evaporac?a?o do\nfluido ocorre na interface entre o meio poroso e a ranhura. Com o aumento do fluxo de\ncalor, o l??quido evapora no menisco e a evaporac?a?o passa a ocorrer tanto na regia?o de\nvapor saturado quanto na interface da ranhura.\n\nA evaporac?a?o no menisco e? modelada assumindo um coeficiente global de transfere?ncia\nde calor que inclui uma resiste?ncia te?rmica condutiva atrave?s do filme l??quido. A trans-\nfere?ncia de calor por conduc?a?o na aleta tambe?m e? resolvida. Seus resultados mostraram\nque a evaporac?a?o e? muito mais intensa na interface meio poroso-ranhura do que na frente\nde evaporac?a?o. Isso ocorre porque o fluxo de vapor fora da regia?o abaixo da aleta e?\ndificultada pelo baixo valor da viscosidade cinema?tica do vapor, em comparac?a?o com a\nviscosidade cinema?tica do l??quido. Os autores apresentam bons resultados, entretanto eles\ntambe?m na?o determinam o valor cr??tico de fluxo de calor para a transic?a?o entre as duas\n\n\n\ncondic?o?es limites estudadas. Somente uma ana?lise qualitativa e? apresentada.\n\nFigus et al. (1999) analisaram um problema semelhante e eles tentaram quantificar\na mudanc?a entre os regimes de evaporac?a?o em func?a?o da variac?a?o do fluxo de calor.\nEles consideraram que a frente de evaporac?a?o estava localizada dentro do meio poroso.\nForam aplicados dois tratamentos diferentes: modelo do cont??nuo, semelhante ao usado\npor Demidov &amp; Yatsenko (1994), e modelo de rede de percolac?a?o de poros, semelhantes\naos modelos desenvolvidos anteriormente por Prat (1993, 1995) e Laurindo &amp; Prat (1996).\n\nFigus et al. (1999) apresentaram soluc?o?es para um meio poroso com condutividade\nte?rmica efetiva baixa (?s = 4 W/m-K) e para um outro meio poroso com condutividade\nte?rmica efetiva alta (?s = 10 W/m-K). Para o meio poroso com condutividade te?rmica\nbaixa, os resultados mostraram que quando o tamanho dos raios dos poros e? constante\ne igual a 10\u00b5m, a frente de evaporac?a?o invade o meio poroso apenas para um fluxo de\ncalor q?? > 4.500 W/m2. As soluc?o?es do problema podem ser bem determinadas atrave?s\ndo modelo do cont??nuo ate? o fluxo de calor ma?ximo de 90.000 W/m2.\n\nNa soluc?a?o obtida com o modelo de rede de percolac?a?o de poros para o meio de\nmaior condutividade te?rmica e com raza?o entre o tamanho de poro ma?ximo e m??nimo\nde R = dmax/dmin = 2, a frente de evaporac?a?o invadiu o meio poroso para um fluxo de\ncalor de q?? = 1.000 W/m2. Acima deste valor, a frente se desenvolveu com uma superf??cie\nirregular. Entre os fluxos 15.000 e 35.000 W/m2, a frente de evaporac?a?o se manteve esta?vel\ndentro do meio poroso. Acima do fluxo de calor de 35.000 W/m2, a a?rea da frente de\nevaporac?a?o aumentou progressivamente ate? a falha do sistema no fluxo de q?? = 200.000\nW/m2.\n\nEmbora Figus et al. (1999) na?o tenham correlacionado o limite para a falha do meio\nporoso, eles mostraram claramente a tende?ncia do processo de invasa?o da frente de eva-\nporac?a?o no meio poroso.\n\nTakahashi (2002) analisou a transfere?ncia de calor e de massa no meio poroso de um\nevaporador capilar a fim de determinar o fluxo de calor ma?ximo antes de sua falha por\nlimite capilar. Takahashi assumiu, como Figus et al. (1999), que a frente da evapora-\nc?a?o estava imersa no meio poroso. Ele resolveu numericamente o problema usando o\nme?todo de volumes finitos em coordenadas curvil??neas ortogonais. Ele usou um me?todo\nde rastreamento da frente evaporac?a?o combinado com uma malha mo?vel. Ele analisou a\namo?nia como fluido de trabalho e obteve as propriedades para o meio poroso de n??quel\nfabricado por Reimbrecht et al. (1999). Ele apresentou os resultados referentes a? loca-\nlizac?a?o da frente de evaporac?a?o para diferentes fluxos de calor. Os valores dos fluxos\nde calor cr??ticos foram calculados para diferentes propriedades (fluxo de calor ma?ximo\nde 13, 06 \u00d7 104 W/m2 para um funcionamento em regime permanente), mas nenhuma\ntentativa foi feita para a parametrizac?a?o dos resultados obtidos.\n\nKaya &amp; Goldak (2006) estudaram numericamente a transfere?ncia de calor e de massa\nna estrutura porosa de um LHP, visando a ocorre?ncia do limite de ebulic?a?o. O problema\nfoi basicamente o mesmo estudado por Demidov &amp; Yatsenko (1994) e Figus et al. (1999)\ncom uma formulac?a?o semelhante. Uma diferenc?a na formulac?a?o foi que o modelo leva em\nconta os termos convectivos da equac?a?o da conservac?a?o da energia. No entanto, como\nmostrado por Cao &amp; Faghri (1994a), a contribuic?a?o desses termos pode ser negligenciada.\n\nA modelagem apresentada por Kaya &amp; Goldak (2006) permite a estabilizac?a?o da frente\nde evaporac?a?o, tanto na superf??cie externa quanto no interior do meio poroso. Depois que\na frente invade o meio poroso, formando uma regia?o de vapor saturado abaixo da aleta,\nos autores consideram que o salto de pressa?o atrave?s da interface deve ser menor do que\n\n\n\na pressa?o capilar e na?o exatamente igual, tal como exigido pelo equil??brio termodina?mico\nnuma interface curva l??quido-vapor. Essa violac?a?o na?o se justifica.\n\nAle?m disso, os autores precisam ainda especificar um superaquecimento da superf??cie\nna interface meio poroso-aleta necessa?rio para criar uma regia?o de vapor saturado. Eles\nassumiram que, se temperatura da superf??cie da aleta for maior do que temperatura de\nsaturac?a?o do fluido a? pressa?o de entrada de l??quido em 4 oC, a frente evaporac?a?o entra no\nmeio poroso. Percebe-se que este crite?rio e? arbitra?rio, uma vez que na?o inclui o tamanho\ndos poros local, o que modificaria o equil??brio termodina?mico local, e essa condic?a?o pode\nmudar dependendo do fluido, do grau de pureza dele, da rugosidade da superf??cie e da\nte?cnica de montagem. Portanto, os resultados apresentados por Kaya &amp; Goldak (2006)\nna?o sa?o confia?veis com relac?a?o ao limite para a formac?a?o da regia?o de vapor saturado\nabaixo da aleta.\n\nAte? o momento, percebe-se que ha? uma falta de informac?a?o sobre a localizac?a?o da\nfrente de evaporac?a?o, ou seja, qual seria o fluxo de calor ma?ximo para o qual o meio poroso\npode suportar antes que a frente de evaporac?a?o passe da superf??cie externa para o interior\ndo meio poroso. Como mencionado anteriormente, a frente da evaporac?a?o pode estabelecer\numa posic?a?o esta?vel dentro do meio poroso, mas essa condic?a?o deve ser evitada. Assim,\no modelo aqui desenvolvido permite determinar quando a frente de evaporac?a?o invade o\nmeio poroso. Ao contra?rio do crite?rio assumido por Kaya &amp; Goldak (2006), neste modelo\num crite?rio confia?vel e? assumido com relac?a?o ao fluxo de calor cr??tico com base na pressa?o\nma?xima capilar que o meio poroso pode suportar. No presente modelo, as condic?o?es\nde contorno assumidas por Cao &amp; Faghri (1994a, 1994b) sa?o melhoradas para melhor\nrepresentar a f??sica do problema.\n\nEm relac?a?o aos testes experimentais, a maioria dos LHPs e CPLs utilizam meios\nporosos feitos de metal e amo?nia como fluido de trabalho. As poucas aplicac?o?es de meios\nporosos cera?micos em LHPs e CPLs na?o obtiveram sucesso. Portanto, nesta trabalho e?\nrealizado um estudo experimental do comportamento te?rmico de dois LHPs e de um CPL\nque utlizam meios porosos cera?micos e a?gua como fluido de trabalho.\n\nResultados e Ana?lise\n\nForam fabricados e testados dois LHPs, um utilizando acetona e o outro a?gua como\nfluidos de trabalho. Os testes foram realizados para pote?ncias de ate? 25 W. Ale?m disso,\nfoi fabricado e testado um CPL usando a?gua. Os testes do CPL foram realizados para\npote?ncias de ate? 30 W. O meio poroso cera?mico utilizado possui 50% de porosidade,\ndistribuic?a?o de raio de poro entre 1 e 3 \u00b5m e uma permeabilidade de 1.5 \u00d7 10?14 m2.\nConsiderando uma temperatura de operac?a?o limite de 100 oC e regime permanente, os\nLHPs foram capazes de transferir ate? 15 W para a?gua e 25 W para acetona, enquanto\nque o CPL foi capaz de transferir ate? 30 W. Apesar do bom desempenho dos sistemas\nde bombeamento capilar avaliados, observou-se que mais pesquisas ainda sa?o necessa?rias,\nbuscando otimizar as propriedades termof??sicas do meio poroso cera?mico e melhorar o\nprojeto dos LHPs e do CPL.\n\nA qualidade dos sistemas de bombeamento tem sido comumente expressa pela re-\n\nsiste?ncia te?rmica total (Rtotal =\n?T\n\nQ\n), no entanto, percebe-se que Rtotal e? dependente do\n\ntamanho do sistema, ou seja, na?o leva em conta a a?rea do evaporador onde a taxa de\ntransfere?ncia de calor e? aplicada. Assim, uma figura de me?rito diferente e? aqui proposta,\n\n\n\nR\n??\n\ntotal =\n?T\n\nq\n?? ,\n\nonde: q\n??\n\ne? o fluxo de calor dissipado pelo sistema de bombeamento capilar e ?T =\nTEvap ?THS e? a diferenc?a de temperatura entre a superf??cie quente, onde a carga te?rmica\ne? aplicada, e o banho te?rmico no condensador.\n\nA Fig. 1 apresenta os resultados obtidos com Rtotal e R\n??\n\ntotal. Percebe-se atrave?s da\nFig. 1(b) que a R\n\n??\n\ntotal do CPL (a?gua) e? maior do que a R\n??\n\ntotal dos LHPs. De acordo com\nos resultados obtidos com R\n\n??\n\ntotal, o LHP (acetona) funcionou melhor do que o CPL e o\nLHP, ambos usando a?gua.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Resiste?ncia te?rmica total versus taxa de transfere?ncia de calor e (b) a re-\nsiste?ncia te?rmica total por cent??metro quadrado versus fluxo de calor para os LHPs e o\nCPL testados.\n\nAs Figs. 2 e 3 apresentam uma comparac?a?o entre os resultados obtidos experimen-\ntalmente nesta tese e os encontrados na literatura para os CPL e LHPs, respectivamente.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 2 \u2013 (a) Resiste?ncia te?rmica total versus taxa de transfere?ncia de calor e (b) a\nresiste?ncia te?rmica total por cent??metro quadrado versus fluxo de calor para o CPL.\n\n\n\nComparando o CPL testado neste trabalho com os encontrados na literatura, percebe-\nse atrave?s da Fig. 2(a) que, de acordo com os resultados calculados atrave?s da Rtotal, o\nCPL testado no presente trabalho apenas operou melhor do que os CPLs apresentados\npor Wang et al. (2008) e por Camargo (2004) (elementos porosos cera?micos). Entretanto,\nde acordo com os resultados calculados atrave?s da R\n\n??\n\ntotal e mostrados na Fig. 2(b), o CPL\ntestado no presente trabalho operou melhor do que os CPLs apresentados na literatura.\n\nPercebe-se atrave?s dos resultados mostrados na Fig. 3 que apesar dos LHPs na?o\nterem operado ta?o bem quanto os mini-LHPs, eles apresentaram resultados satisfato?rios.\nUma das razo?es para este resultado relativamente fraco, e? que os mini-LHPs encontrados\nna literatura utilizaram amo?nia como fluido de trabalho que, devido a?s suas propriedades\nte?rmicas, e? considerado o melhor fluido de trabalho para sistemas de bombeamento capilar.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 3 \u2013 (a) Resiste?ncia te?rmica total versus taxa de transfere?ncia de calor e (b) a\nresiste?ncia te?rmica total por cent??metro quadrado versus fluxo de calor para os LHPs.\n\nUma comparac?a?o e? feita entre os resultados experimentais e teo?ricos As curvas do raio\nme?dio cr??tico adimensional em func?a?o do fluxo de calor de entrada adimensional para um\nmeio poroso com uma ou duas camadas sa?o comparadas com o raio me?dio adimensional\ndo elemento poroso cera?mico testado neste trabalho para cada fluxo de calor aplicado aos\nsistemas de bombeamento capilar (Fig. 4).\n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Comparac?a?o entre os resultados experimentais e teo?ricos.\n\n\n\nPercebe-se atrave?s da Fig. 4 que apenas o LHP (acetona) atingiu o limite capilar para\no meio poroso com uma camada. Apesar do LHP (acetona) ter atingido o limite capi-\nlar, ele continuou operando para as taxas de transfere?ncia de calor de 20 e 25 W. Desta\nforma, de acordo com o modelo (apresentado no Cap??tulo 2), a frente de evaporac?a?o in-\nvadiu o meio poroso e encontrou uma localizac?a?o esta?vel dentro dele. No entanto, esta\ncomparac?a?o deve ser tomada apenas como uma primeira aproximac?a?o, uma vez que o\nmodelo teo?rico na?o reproduz completamente a geometria dos sistemas de bombeamento\ncapilar testados. No entanto, as tende?ncias f??sicas permanecem as mesmas.\n\nConcluso?es e Recomendac?o?es para Trabalhos Futuros\n\nQuanto a? modelagem do problema da transfere?ncia de calor e de massa em eva-\nporadores capilares, um crite?rio confia?vel para o in??cio da secagem do meio poroso foi\ndeterminado. Quanto ao desenvolvimento de evaporadores capilares de LHP e CPL, um\nelemento poroso cera?mico foi proposto como uma alternativa aos elementos porosos feito\nde metal e pol??meros. Estes evaporadores capilares testados operaram de maneira esta?vel\ne confia?vel em ambos LHP e CPL.\n\nOs resultados experimentais foram comparados com os resultados teo?ricos obtidos\ncom o modelo. Apenas o LHP (acetona) atingiu o limite capilar para o meio poroso\ncom uma camada. Apesar do LHP (acetona) ter atingido o limite capilar, ele continuou\noperando para as taxas de transfere?ncia de calor de 20 e 25 W. Desta forma, de acordo\ncom o modelo (apresentado no Cap??tulo 2), a frente de evaporac?a?o invadiu o meio poroso\ne encontrou uma localizac?a?o esta?vel dentro dele. No entanto, esta comparac?a?o deve ser\ntomada apenas como uma primeira aproximac?a?o, uma vez que o modelo teo?rico na?o\nreproduz completamente a geometria dos sistemas de bombeamento capilar aqui testados.\nNo entanto, as tende?ncias f??sicas permanecem as mesmas. Se um meio poroso com duas\ncamadas com condutividades te?rmicas diferentes for usado em vez de um meio poroso com\numa camada, foi observado que quanto maior a condutividade te?rmica abaixo da aleta,\nmaior o limite capilar.\n\nEssas sa?o as principais sugesto?es para trabalhos futuros:\n\n? Adaptar o modelo para a geometria cil??ndrica real dos evaporadores capilares tes-\ntados.\n\n? Projetar mini-LHPs e mini-CPLs a fim de aplica?-los em computadores porta?teis e\nde mesa.\n\n? Testar o LHP e o CPL em ambiente de micro-gravidade para aplicac?a?o aeroespacial.\n\n? Produzir um meio poroso cera?mico com condutividade te?rmica maior.\n\n\n\nFEDERAL UNIVERSITY OF SANTA CATARINA\n\nGRADUATE PROGRAM IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING\n\nTHEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL\n\nSTUDY OF THE APPLICATION OF A\n\nCERAMIC POROUS WICK IN LHP AND\n\nCPL\n\nThesis\n\nPAULO HENRIQUE DIAS DOS SANTOS\n\nFloriano?polis, SC\n\n2010\n\n\n\nFEDERAL UNIVERSITY OF SANTA CATARINA\n\nGRADUATE PROGRAM IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING\n\nTHEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL STUDY\n\nOF THE APPLICATION OF A CERAMIC\n\nPOROUS WICK IN LHP AND CPL\n\nThesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the\n\ndegree of Doctor in Mechanical Engineering\n\nPAULO HENRIQUE DIAS DOS SANTOS\n\nFloriano?polis, December of 2010\n\n\n\nFEDERAL UNIVERSITY OF SANTA CATARINA\n\nGRADUATE PROGRAM IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING\n\nTHEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF THE\n\nAPPLICATION OF A CERAMIC POROUS WICK IN LHP\n\nAND CPL\n\nPAULO HENRIQUE DIAS DOS SANTOS\n\nThis doctoral thesis was judged adequate as partial requisite to the degree of\n\nDOCTOR IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING\n\nand approved on its final version by the Graduate Program in Mechanical Engineering.\n\nProf. Edson Bazzo, Dr. \u2013 Advisor\n\nProf. Amir Anto?nio Martins de Oliveira Jr., Ph.D. \u2013 Co-advisor\n\nProf. Eduardo Alberto Fancello, D.Sc. \u2013 Coordinator of the Graduate\nProgram in Mechanical Engineering - POSMEC/UFSC\n\nREFEREE COMMITTEE\n\nProf. Edson Bazzo, Dr. \u2013 President\n\nProf. Paulo Couto, Dr. \u2013 Relator\n\nProf. Carlos Antonio Cabral dos Santos, D.Sc.\n\nProf. Se?rgio Colle, D.Sc.\n\nProf. Jader Riso Barbosa Jr., Ph.D.\n\n\n\nxix\n\n\u201cYou are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its\n\nsaltiness be restored?

Heat\n\ntransfer devices capable of transferring large heat loads with a minimal temperature drop\n\nare required. In this context, Heat Pipes (HPs), Loop Heat Pipes (LHPs) and Capillary\n\nPumping Loops (CPLs) are reliable and feasible alternatives for heat dissipation. The\n\ncapillary evaporators of most LHPs and CPLs use porous wicks made of sintered metal\n\nand plastic. A ceramic porous wick is proposed in this work as an alternative to wicks\n\nmade of these common materials for applications in LHPs and CPLs. A theoretical and\n\nexperimental analysis is presented. First, the heat and mass transfer in a flat capillary\n\nevaporator formed by a single or double-layered porous wick is analyzed. The wick has a\n\nshape of a flat disc and it is assembled between the liquid and vapor channels. An external\n\nheat input is applied in the upper surface of the wick, where the working fluid evaporates.\n\nThe mass and heat transfer are modeled using the mass and energy macroscopic conser-\n\nvation equations. The fluid is assumed incompressible, local thermal equilibrium prevails\n\nand Darcy\u2019s Law is used to model the viscous flow within the porous medium. The\n\nmodels developed allow to verify the effect of design variables, such as working fluids,\n\ndimensions, permeability, average pore radius and thermal conductivity of the wick, in\n\nthe performance of the capillary evaporator. For the experimental analysis, performance\n\ntests of two LHPs using acetone and water as working fluids were carried out for power\n\ninputs up to 25 W and performance tests of one CPL using water were carried out for\n\npower inputs up to 30 W. The ceramic porous wick used had 50% of porosity, 1 to 3\n\n\u00b5m of pore radius distribution and a permeability of about 1.5 \u00d7 10?14 m2. Limiting the\noperation temperature at 100 oC, at steady state, the LHPs were capable to transfer up\n\nto 25 W using acetone and 15 W using water, and the CPL was capable to transfer up to\n\n30 W. Despite the good performance of the LHPs and CPL tested, it was observed that\n\nfurther research are still required for the optimization of the properties of the ceramic\n\nporous wick and for improving the design of the LHPs and CPL.\n\n\n\n1\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe electronics industry has grown at a rapid pace seeking the miniaturization and\n\nbetter performance of components. At the scales reached nowadays, the thermal control\n\nof electronic equipment has become an important issue. There is a need to develop heat\n\ntransfer devices that are capable of transferring large amounts of heat with a minimal\n\ntemperature drop. In this context, Heat Pipes (HP), Loop Heat Pipes (LHP) and Capil-\n\nlary Pumping Loops (CPL) are reliable and feasible alternatives as heat transfer devices.\n\nThey are passive two-phase devices that utilize the evaporation and condensation of a\n\nworking fluid to transfer heat. The thermal fluid circulation is accomplished by the cap-\n\nillary forces generated in a porous wick. Therefore, the working fluid pumping does not\n\nconsume electric power. In this thesis, the LHP and the CPL are studied.\n\nIn the last decades, there has been an increased acceptance of these systems in the\n\naerospace community because of their performance advantages, unique characteristics of\n\noperation and the success in operation in recent flight experiments. As a result, research\n\nhas been intensified in order to better understand the phenomena that occur in these\n\nthermal systems. Ku &amp; Kroliczek (1987), Maydanik et al. (1991), Ku (1994), Maydanik\n\n(1999), Ku (1999), Nikitkin &amp; Cullimore (1998), Chernysheva et al. (2007), Santos &amp;\n\nBazzo (2007), among others, report past and recent advances.\n\n1.1 CPL and LHP Classification and Basic Operation\n\nCPL and LHP operate within a range of temperatures basically defined by the work-\n\ning fluid properties. The choice of working fluid involves several factors associated to\n\nthe operation, availability and safety. Ammonia is frequently used in capillary pumping\n\nsystems but other working fluids such as water, ethanol, acetone, propylene, methanol,\n\nbutane, isobutene and propane also result in good operation (PETERSON, 1994). The\n\nrange of operation temperatures constitutes the preliminary condition for the selection of\n\nthe possible thermal fluid for a given application. The maximum range lies between the\n\ntriple and critical points, because below the triple point and above the critical point there\n\nis no circulation of the thermal fluid by capillary action.\n\n\n\n1 Introduction 2\n\nThe capillary pumping capacity depends on the surface tension of the working fluid\n\nand the properties of the porous wick. Up to now, the working fluids have been classified\n\naccording to the capillary limit, i.e., the maximum pumping pressure that the porous wick\n\ncan provide. There is another limit called the boiling limit, but for lack of a better strategy,\n\nthe fluids that present this problem have been avoided. The boiling limit is related to\n\nthe evaporation process of the working fluid in the liquid feeding channel and/or in the\n\nwick due to high temperature of liquid that flows into the evaporator. Ku (1994) studied\n\nthe operation of a CPL, basing his analysis on the Pressure-Temperature (PT) diagram\n\nand his conclusions justified the need for a high state of subcooling in the entrance of the\n\ncapillary evaporator required by some working fluids such as water and toluene. That\n\nis, the greater the subcooling requirement of a determined working fluid, the lower the\n\nboiling limit. A similar analysis, using the PT diagram, was also published for LHP by\n\nMaydanik et al. (1991), Ku (1999) and Maydanik (2005). The occurance of these two\n\noperating limits will be analyzed in this work.\n\nThe operation modes of the capillary pumping systems can be classified as fixed or\n\nvariable conductance. In the variable conductance mode, the system saturation tempera-\n\nture can be controlled for different thermal loads. On the other hand, in the fixed conduc-\n\ntance mode, the greater the thermal load, the greater the system saturation temperature.\n\nNikitkin &amp; Cullimore (1998) presented qualitative graphs of the vapor temperature for\n\nCPL and LHP operating in the fixed and variable conductance modes. Chernysheva et\n\nal. (2007) presented similar quantitative graphs for LHP.\n\nIn the following, an overview of the CPL and LHP theory is presented. The fixed and\n\nvariable conductance modes and the PT diagrams for CPL and LHP are discussed.\n\n1.1.1 CPL with Fixed Conductance\n\nFigure 1.1 depicts a typical fixed conductance CPL. This device is composed of an\n\nevaporator, a condenser, a subcooler and liquid and vapor transport lines. The evaporator\n\npossesses a wick that promotes the working fluid circulation in the loop. The fluid circu-\n\nlation occurs in a continuous way and in the same direction, differently of the circulation\n\nin the heat pipe, where the liquid and the vapor flow in opposite directions.\n\nFixed conductance CPLs operate in the following way: heat is supplied to the evapora-\n\ntor and the liquid into the wick evaporates, forming menisci at the liquid-vapor interface.\n\nThe capillary forces developed by the curvatures of the menisci promote the working fluid\n\ncirculation along the loop. The vapor formed in the capillary evaporator flows through\n\nthe vapor transport line to the condenser, where heat is removed. The liquid formed\n\n\n\n1 Introduction 3\n\nFigure 1.1 \u2013 Schematic diagram of a fixed conductance CPL.\n\nin the condenser is subcooled before being transported back to the evaporator. All the\n\npressure losses in the system are supplied by the capillary pressure difference originated\n\nin the porous wick of the capillary evaporator.\n\nFixed conductance CPLs have the following operating characteristics: (i) the sub-\n\ncooler is usually an integral part of the condenser; (ii) they do not have a reservoir that\n\nworks as a fluid accumulator; (iii) the vapor condensation area in the condenser remains\n\nconstant as the thermal load varies; (iv) the system operation temperature is dependent\n\non the thermal load, supplied to the evaporator, and on the condenser sink temperature.\n\nAt the evaporation front (liquid-vapor interface), the pressure difference between the\n\nphases is the capillary pressure, which can be expressed by the Young-Laplace\u2019s equation,\n\n?pcap = pv ?pl =\n2? cos ?\n\nr\n. (1.1)\n\nFor an averaged radius of curvature r of the liquid-vapor interfaces, the capillary\n\npressure becomes maximum when the contact angle between the liquid and the solid\n\napproaches zero, in other words, when the wettability of the working fluid is maximum.\n\nAt the evaporation interface, the average radius of curvature of the liquid-vapor in-\n\nterface adjusts itself in order to balance the capillary pressure, as predicted by Young-\n\nLaplace\u2019s equation above. The minimum possible radius of curvature before dry-out of\n\nthe pore is the characteristic radius of the pore. This radius depends on the pore topol-\n\nogy and is determined by the choice of base material and manufacturing process, e.g.,\n\nsintering, used to produce the porous wicks. The maximum capillary pressure that the\n\nwick can withstand for a zero contact angle is therefore,\n\n\n\n1 Introduction 4\n\n?pcap,max =\n2?\n\nrp\n(1.2)\n\nThis characteristic average pore radius rp for the pore structure is related to the\n\nthreshold for percolation of the non-wetting phase and is commonly identified, by Young-\n\nLaplace, as the wick bubbling pressure. In the operation of a capillary evaporator, when\n\nthe pressure losses of the system exceed the maximum capillary pressure, the system fails.\n\nThe capillary limit of a CPL reflects this maximum pumping capacity.\n\nTherefore, the normal CPL operation requires that the sum of the pressure losses\n\nin the components and in the transport lines be smaller than the maximum capillary\n\npressure head developed by the wick, i.e.,\n\n?pcap,max ? ?pevap + ?pcond + ?pv + ?pl + ?pg (1.3)\n\nIn Eq. 1.3 the pressure losses are identified as: ?pevap - pressure loss in the evaporator,\n\n?pcond - pressure loss in the condenser, ?pv - pressure loss in the vapor lines, ?pl - pressure\n\nloss in the liquid lines and ?pg - pressure difference due to gravity.\n\nThe pressure loss along the lines of liquid (?pl) and vapor (?pv) can be approximated\n\nby using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n\n?p(l) or (v) = f\n\n(\nL\n\ndh\n\n)(\n?v2\n\n2\n\n)\n, (1.4)\n\nwhere f is the Darcy (or Moody) friction factor, L is the pipe length, dh is the hydraulic\n\ndiameter and v is the average flow velocity.\n\nThe most important component of the total pressure loss, accounting for approxi-\n\nmately from 40 to 95% of the total pressure loss, is the pressure drop along the porous\n\nstructure of the capillary evaporator. This pressure loss can be approximated by Darcy\u2019s\n\nequation,\n\n?pwick =\nl\u00b5l\n\n?lAlKl\n\n.\nml (1.5)\n\nwhere\nAl\nl\n\nis the average area for flow divided by the lenght of the flow path, \u00b5l is the\n\nliquid dynamic viscosity, Kl is the liquid permeability and\n.\nml is the liquid mass flow rate\n\naccross the porous wick.\n\nThis estimate will be further improved when the results are analyzed. For now, it\n\n\n\n1 Introduction 5\n\nmakes it clear that the permeability of the porous medium, which ranges from 10?10 to\n\n10?15 m2 for different porous structures, affects greatly the pressure drop.\n\nThe Carman-Kozeny equation provides a simple model that relates permeability to\n\nthe average pore diameter such that,\n\nKl =\n?3\n\n180 (1 ? ?)2\nd2, (1.6)\n\nwhere ? is the porosity and d is the average pore diameter of the porous wick. The validity\n\nof this equation will not be discussed now. It suffices to say that the permeability scales\n\nwith the square of the average pore diameter.\n\nThe maximum capillary pressure head is a function of the fluid surface tension, the\n\ncontact angle and the pore radius. On the other hand, the pressure losses on the right side\n\nof Eq. 1.3, depend on the system design and the power input to the evaporator. When\n\nthe total pressure loss in the system exceeds the maximum capillary pressure head, vapor\n\npenetrates in the wick causing dry-out and possibly blockage of the liquid inlet. When\n\nthis occurs, the system fails.\n\nThe thermodynamic states of the working fluid may be suitably presented in a p-T\n\ndiagram such as the one shown in Fig. 1.2. The numbering corresponds to the states\n\nidentified in Fig. 1.1. In point 1, the liquid vaporizes at a saturation temperature T1\n\ncorresponding to a pressure p1. The vapor flows along the evaporator grooves and there\n\nis a pressure drop due to viscous friction from p1 to p2. Point 2 is located closer to the\n\nevaporator outlet, where liquid vaporizes at a lower saturation temperature T\n?\n2. Therefore,\n\nthe liquid vaporizes along the external wick surface at a temperature range between T1 and\n\nT\n?\n2, instead of a fixed temperature T1. The vapor leaves the evaporator in the superheated\n\nstate (point 2) partly due to the decrease in the saturation pressure and partly due to\n\nthe proximity of the hot source that supplies heat to the system. The vapor pressure\n\ndecreases as it flows along the vapor transport line, between points 2 and 3. Since the\n\nvapor experiences an adiabatic expansion, its temperature decreases slightly.\n\nThe thermodynamic state of the vapor that enters in the condenser is represented by\n\nthe temperature T3 and pressure p3. As shown by Ku (1994), a small area of the condenser\n\nis enough to dissipate the sensible heat before the beginning of the vapor condensation in\n\nthe point 4 at a pressure p4 (smaller than p3) and at a saturation temperature T4. The\n\nvapor condensation occurs between points 4 and 5. At point 5 there is no longer vapor.\n\nSimilar to the liquid vaporization in the evaporator, the vapor condensation occurs at a\n\ntemperature range between T4 and T5. The liquid continues to lose sensible heat until\n\nit reaches a subcooled temperature T6 in the condenser outlet. A further subcooling\n\n\n\n1 Introduction 6\n\nFigure 1.2 \u2013 Functional schematic of a fixed conductance CPL (corresponding to Fig.\n1.1).\n\nis needed to T\n?\n6 to ensure that no vapor bubble reaches in the evaporator. The liquid\n\ntemperature increases slightly to T7, while the pressure decreases to p7 in the liquid\n\nfeeding channel of the evaporator. Inside the feeding channel, the liquid is heated until\n\ntemperature T8. This heating is due to the upstream heat leak from the wick to the fluid.\n\nThe point 8\n?\n\nrepresents the saturation state corresponding to the local pressure p8.\n\nFrom point 8 to point 9 the liquid pressure falls. As the liquid flows through the wick,\n\nits temperature is increased until reaching the saturation temperature T1 corresponding\n\nto the pressure p1 before its evaporation in the external surface of the wick. It is noticed\n\nby Fig. 1.2 that the liquid side of the menisci (point 9) is represented as superheated.\n\nThe total pressure drop in the system is equal to the difference between p1 and p9\n\nwhich in its turn must be smaller than the maximum capillary pressure head for normal\n\noperation. Following Ku (1999), in most of the two-phase capillary pumping systems,\n\nthe changes of pressure and temperature are extremely small. These changes along a\n\nsaturation line may be approximated using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\ndp\n\ndT\n\n????\nTsat\n\n=\nhlv\n\nTsatvlv\n(1.7)\n\nwhere hlv is the latent heat of vaporization, Tsat is the saturation temperature and vlv is\n\nthe difference in specific volumes of the liquid and vapor phases.\n\nFor instance, the variation of the pressure and temperature between points 1 and 4\n\nare related by\n\n\n\n1 Introduction 7\n\ndp\n\ndT\n\n????\nT4\n\n(T1 ?T4) ' (p1 ?p4) . (1.8)\n\nThis pressure drop is a function of the mass flow rate which in its turn is a function\n\nof the power input to the evaporator.\n\nThe heat transfer rate at vaporization is equal to that at condensation (\n.\n\nQcond =\n.\n\nQevap).\n\nThe heat transfer rate in the condenser can be expressed as:\n\n.\n\nQcond = hcondAcond (T4 ?T0) , (1.9)\n\nwhere hcond is the heat transfer coefficient, Acond is the heat transfer area in the condenser\n\nand T0 is the temperature of the cold reservoir outside the condenser.\n\nFor a CPL with fixed liquid volume, the thermal conductance (hcondAcond) remains\n\nconstant. For a given heat transfer rate rejected by the condenser (\n.\n\nQcond) and a condenser\n\nsink temperature T0, the vapor in the condenser will condense at the temperature T4 in\n\nagreement with Eq. 1.9 and the liquid will vaporize in the evaporator at the temperature\n\nT1 in agreement with Eq. 1.8. Any change in the input heat to the evaporator and/or\n\nin the condenser sink temperature will result in changes of the T1 and T4. Therefore, the\n\nmain characteristic of a fixed conductance CPL is its strong dependence of the operation\n\ntemperature on the input heat and condenser sink temperature.\n\n1.1.2 CPL with Variable Conductance\n\nIn a variable conductance CPL, an online fluid reservoir is added. The function of\n\nthe reservoir is to control the operation temperature of the system and to accumulate the\n\nliquid excess that is not being required in the loop.\n\nThe variable conductance mechanism may be explained using Eq. 1.9. If the condenser\n\nsink temperature T0 remains constant and the system thermal load increases, more vapor\n\nwill be generated in the evaporator and the vapor excess will accumulate in the condenser,\n\ncausing a local pressure increase. This pressure increase, in its turn, causes a liquid\n\ndisplacement from the condenser to the reservoir, as represented in Fig. 1.3. This occurs\n\nbecause the condensation temperature T4 remains constant and the heat transfer area\n\nAcond increases so that Eq. 1.9 is satisfied.\n\nWhen the system thermal load decreases and T0 remains constant, the vapor pressure\n\ninto the condenser will decrease. An unbalance in the pressure difference between the\n\nreservoir and the condenser will force a liquid displacement from the reservoir to the\n\n\n\n1 Introduction 8\n\nFigure 1.3 \u2013 Functional schematic of a fixed conductance CPL.\n\ncondenser, reducing the heat transfer area Acond so that Eq. 1.9 is again satisfied. A\n\nsimilar analysis can be made varying the condenser sink temperature T0.\n\nFigure 1.4 depicts a PT diagram for the variable conductance CPL shown in Fig. 1.3.\n\nPoint 11 corresponds to the saturation state in the reservoir. The vapor condensation tem-\n\nperature T4 is related to the reservoir saturation temperature T11 by Clausius-Clapeyron\n\nand this temperature difference can be approximated by,\n\n(T4 ?T11) =\n(p4 ?p11) T11vlv\n\nhlv\n. (1.10)\n\nFigure 1.4 \u2013 PT diagram for a variable conductance CPL (corresponding to Fig. 1.3).\n\nThe variable conductance CPL, represented in Fig. 1.3, operates as follows. Before\n\nthe system startup, the condenser is submitted to the temperature T0 and the reservoir\n\nis heated up to temperature T11 which is higher than the temperatures of the rest of the\n\n\n\n1 Introduction 9\n\nloop. Then, the thermal load is supplied to the evaporator. As the evaporator is heated\n\nup to the same temperature T11 or slightly above that, the liquid is vaporized and flows to\n\nthe condenser along the vapor transport line. An equilibrium condition is established in\n\nthe condenser so that the vapor condenses at the temperature T4 that is very close to the\n\nreservoir temperature T11. An equilibrium condition is also established in the evaporator\n\nso that the liquid vaporizes at the temperature T1.\n\nThe condensation temperature T4 is not sensitive neither to the changes in the con-\n\ndenser sink temperature T0, nor to the changes in the system thermal load. Therefore,\n\nthe temperature T4 is controlled by the reservoir saturation temperature T11. This tem-\n\nperature control is only possible if the reservoir is under two phase condition.\n\n1.1.3 LHP\n\nLHP is a kind of variable conductance CPL and was developed to overcome the\n\napparent disadvantage of CPL that requires pre-heating during the startup. In LHP,\n\nthe reservoir, also denominated hydro-accumulator or compensation chamber, ensures\n\nthe presence of liquid in the evaporator wick. A secondary wick usually connects the\n\ncompensation chamber to the evaporator. The compensation chamber is located close to\n\nthe evaporator, usually in the inlet of the capillary evaporator, as it can be seen in Fig. 1.5;\n\nor taking the place of what would be the liquid feeding channel of the evaporator. Thereby,\n\nin a LHP the liquid reservoir presents direct thermal contact with the evaporator (hot\n\nsource), differently of CPL where it is connected to the condenser (cold source). Figure\n\n1.6 depicts a PT diagram for the variable conductance LHP, shown in Fig. 1.5. Point 10\n\ncorresponds to the saturation state in the compensation chamber.\n\nFigure 1.5 \u2013 Functional schematic of a LHP.\n\n\n\n1 Introduction 10\n\nFigure 1.6 \u2013 PT diagram for a LHP (corresponding to Fig. 1.5).\n\nThe liquid vaporization temperature T1 is related to the saturation temperature of\n\nthe compensation chamber T10 by Clausius-Clapeyron approximated as,\n\n(T1 ?T10) =\n(p1 ?p10) T10vlv\n\nhlv\n. (1.11)\n\nThe PT diagram, shown in Fig. 1.6, presents an analysis for steady state operation.\n\nTherefore, there is no mass flow from the compensation chamber to the liquid feeding\n\nchannel of the evaporator. Consequently, the saturation pressure p10 in the compensation\n\nchamber is the same as pressure p7.\n\n1.1.4 CPL and LHP\n\nThe capillary pumping systems in the variable conductance mode, i.e., the CPL and\n\nLHP shown in Figs. 1.3 and 1.5, can also work in a binary operation mode. When\n\nthese systems are operating in a low thermal load condition, the reservoir (CPL) or the\n\ncompensation chamber (LHP) present stable liquid and vapor regions. As it was al-\n\nready mentioned, when the thermal load increases, the condensation front moves forward,\n\ncausing a liquid displacement from the condenser to the reservoir (CPL) or to the com-\n\npensation chamber (LHP). Therefore, as the thermal load increases, these compartments\n\nare increasingly filled in with liquid. The evaporation temperature control is only possible\n\nif the liquid compartment of the system presents both liquid and vapor. Consequently, if\n\nthe thermal load increases up to a condition where all the volume of the reservoir (CPL) or\n\nthe compensation chamber (LHP) is filled with liquid, the saturation temperature control\n\n\n\n1 Introduction 11\n\nceases to be possible.\n\nFigure 1.7 shows qualitatively the variation of the evaporation temperature distribu-\n\ntion as a function of the thermal load of CPL and LHP that work in the binary operation\n\nmode (fixed and variable conductance). Fig. 1.7(a) depicts that the evaporator tempera-\n\nture of the CPL remains constant in the variable conductance operation mode and starts\n\nto increase linearly in the fixed conductance mode. For the LHP, Fig. 1.7(b), even oper-\n\nating in the variable conductance operation mode, the evaporator temperature does not\n\nremain constant. The LHP possesses a range of evaporation temperature control in the\n\nvariable conductance mode. This occurs, according to Chernysheva et al. (2007), due to\n\ntwo factors: (i) decrease of the condensation area, caused by the liquid displacement from\n\nthe condenser to the compensation chamber; and (ii) change in the saturation temperature\n\nin the compensation chamber T11, that influences directly the change of the evaporation\n\ntemperature, due to a complex process of heat and mass transfer. This process develops\n\nbetween the evaporator and the compensation chamber.\n\nFigure 1.7 \u2013 Typical curves of operation for (a) CPL and (b) LHP in the fixed and variable\nconductance (NIKITKIN; CULLIMORE, 1998).\n\nThe thermo and fluid dynamic analysis of capillary pumping systems, presented in\n\nthese sections, has helped to explain the phenomena that occur in these systems. The\n\nnext section summarizes the main results of recent research involving the application of\n\ncapillary pumping systems (CPLs and LHPs) for thermal control in general.\n\n1.2 Overview of CPL and LHP Experiments\n\nThermal control has become a relevant issue in modern computers due to their con-\n\ntinuous size decreasing and power increasing requirements. According to Nikitkin &amp;\n\nCullimore (1998) and Maydanik (2005), the LHPs and CPLs, which were previously de-\n\nveloped for spacecraft thermal control, are reliable alternatives and can also transport\n\nheat with high performance for terrestrial electronic cooling application. Several authors\n\n\n\n1 Introduction 12\n\n(CHEN; LIN, 2001; HOANG et al., 2003; PASTUKHOV et al., 2003; MAYDANIK, 2005; CHEN et\n\nal., 2006; PASTUKHOV; MAYDANIK, 2007) have reported experimental results concerning\n\nthe application of LHPs, mini-LHPs and CPLs for heat dissipation in CPUs of modern\n\ncomputers, showing that they are efficient and reliable heat transfer devices for the next\n\ngeneration of microprocessors.\n\nIt has been customary to express the quality of LHPs and CPLs by the thermal\n\nresistance R(oC/W) given by,\n\nR =\n?T\n\nQ\n, (1.12)\n\nwhere Q is the heat transfer rate dissipated by the two-phase system and ?T is the\n\ntemperature difference between the hot surface, where the thermal load is applied, and\n\nthe cold reservoir.\n\nThe thermal resistence is size dependent, but it is the figure of merit usually reported\n\nin the literature. A different figure of merit will be proposed when the results of this work\n\nare analyzed.\n\nThe thermal performance and reliability of the LHPs and CPLs have been extensively\n\ntested. Ku (1999), Chen &amp; Lin (2001), Pastukhov et al. (2003), Chuang (2003), Ku et al.\n\n(2004), Pastukhov &amp; Maydanik (2007), Maydanik &amp; Vershinin (2009) analyzed the ther-\n\nmal behavior and startup of the capillary pumping systems (LHP and CPL) regarding\n\nthe working fluid inventory, slopes of the capillary systems, wick material (nickel, stain-\n\nless steel, copper, polyethylene), body material of the evaporator (copper and stainless\n\nsteel), cooling system of the condenser (forced convection using water and air, and nat-\n\nural convection using air), multi-evaporators and condensers, heat sink and environment\n\ntemperatures at ground and microgravity conditions for a range of power inputs. The\n\nmost recent and promissing systems are reviewed below.\n\nHoang et al. (2003) have developed and tested three miniature LHPs with ammonia,\n\npropylene and water as working fluids for electronics cooling. All LHPs were assisted by a\n\nsecondary cooling system in the compensation chamber in order to decrease the heat leak.\n\nTwo cooling systems were tested: a small thermo-electric cooler (TEC) and a heat pipe\n\nmade of copper with 3 mm of diameter, which uses water as working fluid. Two of the\n\nLHPs were capable of transporting heat up to 60 W (ammonia) and 15 W (propylene)\n\nat room temperature of 25 oC in any orientation. The other LHP using water, which\n\nwas the main objective of the paper, was tested with and without the heat pipe at the\n\ncompensation chamber. An air cooling fan was used for the cooling of the condenser.\n\nThis LHP was made of copper and the wick was made of Teflon with pore size of 7 \u00b5m\n\n\n\n1 Introduction 13\n\nand permeability of 1 \u00d7 10?13 m2. The water LHP was capable of transporting heat\nup to 220 W for a capillary pump temperature up to 82 oC assisted by the heat pipe\n\nin the compensation chamber and up to 90 oC without the heat pipe assistence. The\n\ntotal thermal resistance ranged from 2.0 to 0.2 oC/W. The use of the heat pipe for the\n\ncontrolling of the heat leak had a significant influence on the heat transfer capacity of the\n\nLHP.\n\nSix miniature LHPs were developed and tested by Pastukhov et al. (2003) for cooling\n\nelectronics components and CPUs of mobile PCs. Ammonia and acetone were used as\n\nworking fluid. Porous wicks made of stainless steel and titanium were used as porous\n\nstructures. Air was used for the condenser cooling and the diameter of the cylindrical\n\nevaporators ranged from 5 to 6 mm. The LHPs were capable of heat transfer up to 40 W\n\nfor cooling the CPU of a notebook with total resistance raging from 1.0 to 2.4 oC/W. The\n\nCPU temperature was kept between 83 and 90 oC. They concluded that further decrease\n\nin total thermal resistance could be obtained by optimization of the LHP design and\n\nthe condenser cooling, and the ammonia as a working fluid ensured better results when\n\ncompared to acetone.\n\nChen et al. (2006) performed a series of tests with a miniature loop heat pipe (mLHP)\n\nwhich was developed for cooling CPUs of mobile personal computers. Amonnia was\n\nused as working fluid and the material of the wick was titanium with break down pore\n\nradius of 17.2 \u00b5m, porosity of 78% and permeability of 11.5 \u00d7 10?12 m2. They tested\nthe mLHP at several positions (horizontal, condenser above evaporator, evaporator above\n\ncondenser, compensation chamber above evaporator and evaporator above compensation\n\nchamber), with emphasis to the position with evaporator 10o above condenser and vice\n\nversa. The thermal behavior of mLHP was evaluated during the start-up and for different\n\nsink temperatures. At sink temperature of 25 oC and in horizontal position, the mLHP\n\nwas capable of transporting heat up to 70 W for a limit temperature of 80 oC and the\n\ntotal thermal resistance ranged from 0.2 to 0.85 oC/W. They concluded that for the\n\ntested mLHPs, which are targeted at consumer electronics cooling, the overall operating\n\ncharacteristics for horizontal orientation proved to be satisfying.\n\nMaydanik &amp; Vershinin (2009) developed and tested nine mLHPs with cylindrical\n\ncapillary evaporators. Three mLHPs with external diameter of 5 mm and six mLHPs\n\nwith external diameter of 6 mm. They used ammonia as working fluid for all mLHPs and\n\ndifferent materials for the wick (titanium, with average pore radius of 9.5 and 17.2 \u00b5m\n\nand porosity of 70 and 78%, and nickel with average pore radius ranging of 13.5 and 10.0\n\n\u00b5m and porosity of 71, 66 and 65%). The envelope of the cylindrical evaporator was made\n\nof titanium and nickel. Several tests were carried out in order to evaluate the thermal\n\n\n\n1 Introduction 14\n\nbehavior of mLHPs taking into account the inclination of the devices, the temperature\n\nof cooling in the condenser section and the type of the cooling fluid (air and water in\n\nforced convection). They presented a methodology for estimating the thermal resistances\n\nand the heat transfer coefficients of the mLHPs. The minima total thermal resistances\n\nwere 0.53 oC/W and 0.14 oC/W for air and water cooling, respectively. The maximum\n\ncapacity was 230 W for water cooling.\n\nAs shown, most of porous wicks are made of metals or polymers. However, these\n\nmaterials present some difficulties for machining (metal wicks) and low capillary pumping\n\ncapacity (polymer wick). The machining of metal wicks may obstruct the surface pores,\n\ndecreasing the permeability. The next section presents some works that were aimed\n\nat manufacturing, characterization and application of porous wick in capillary pumping\n\nsystems.\n\n1.3 Application of Ceramic Wicks in Capillary Pump-\n\ning Systems\n\nAlthough the LHPs and CPLs present high heat transfer capacity, one disadvantage\n\nis their complicated manufacture. The proper fitting of the capillary structure inside the\n\nenvelope of the evaporator is the first challenge to be overcome. The assembly is relatively\n\ncomplex because the metallic envelope requires close contact tolerances at the interface\n\nbetween envelope walls and wick surface. This contact should be fit in order to minimize\n\nthe thermal resistance and any vapor leak back to the compensation chamber (LHP) and\n\nto the liquid feeding channel (CPL). With the aim of obtaining close tolerances, a reliable\n\nmachining process is required for these wick structures because the possibility of open\n\nporosity obstruction due to the plastic deformation. The ceramic wicks do not present\n\nplastic deformation during machining. Therefore, they can be machined by conventional\n\nmachining and the open porosity remains the same (JANSSEN et al., 2008).\n\nTo this author knowledge, there are few capillary pumping systems using ceramic\n\nporous wick as a porous structure of capillary evaporator (RASSAMAKIN et al., 2002; RHI,\n\n2006). Most LHPs and CPLs use polyethylene or metallic porous wicks. It is expected\n\nthat ceramic wicks become more advantageous, because they are less expensive and easier\n\nto machine without damaging the pores in the external surface of the structure. Also the\n\nlow thermal conductivity can minimize the radial heat leak to the liquid feeding channel,\n\nreducing the possibility of boiling in the liquid inlet.\n\nReimbrecht (2004) developed a methodology for manufacturing of porous wicks for\n\nthe application in capillary pumping systems. Several techniques - image analysis, mer-\n\n\n\n1 Introduction 15\n\ncury intrusion porosimetry and other experimental methods - were employed to determine\n\nstatic and transport properties of the porous wick such as critical pore diameter, perme-\n\nability and thermal conductivity. He manufactured metallic (nickel and stainless steel)\n\nand ceramic porous wicks and tested them in capillary pumping loops (CPLs). The CPL\n\nwith the ceramic porous wick was capable of heat transfer up to 40 W (1.4 W/cm2) using\n\nacetone. However this CPL did not work adequately in a second test for a heat load of 20\n\nW (0.7 W/cm2). The failure was due to the contamination of the working fluid caused by\n\nthe residual carbon from the organic material that was used to increase porosity in the\n\nmanufacturing of the ceramic wick.\n\nThe wicks obtained by Reimbrecht (2004) had critical pore diameter of 0.9 \u00b5m (nickel)\n\nand 2.5 \u00b5m (stainless steel). The ceramic porous wicks and their pore size distribution\n\nobtained by mercury porosimetry are depicted in Fig. 1.8. It can be noted in Fig. 1.8 (b)\n\nthat the ceramic porous wick has a narrow pore size distribution with 95% of the pore\n\nvolume being formed by pores with sizes ranging from 0.5 \u00b5m to 3.5 \u00b5m with average at\n\n1.2 \u00b5m.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 1.8 \u2013 (a) Ceramic wick samples and (b) pore size distribution obtained by mercury\nintrusion porosimetry, Reimbrecht (2004).\n\nThe objective of the work by Reimbrecht (2004) was to study and optimize the porous\n\nsamples manufacturing routes, as well as, to evaluate the characterization of these porous\n\nstructures for the application in capillary pumping systems. With this goal, nickel, stain-\n\nless steel, mullite and alumina were employed as raw materials. Camargo (2004) aimed at\n\ntest and analyze all porous wicks manufactured by Reimbrecht (2004), and also another\n\nwick made of polyethylene. Two test rigs were built to evaluate the developed CPLs. He\n\ntested the CPLs using acetone and ammonia as working fluid, reaching pumping capacity\n\nup to 25 kPa. The main results presented by Camargo (2004) for the CPL using ammonia\n\nare summarized in Table 1.1.\n\n\n\n1 Introduction 16\n\nTable 1.1 \u2013 Main results presented in Camargo (2004).\n\nPorous wick Heat Flux Capillary Pressure(a) Pore Diameter Permeability\n(W/cm2) (kPa) (\u00b5m) (m2)\n\nNickel 3.15 12.99 1.0 8.6 \u00d7 10?14\nStainless Steal 3.15 17.34 2.0 5.3 \u00d7 10?14\nPolyethylene 3.00 3.09 0.6 26 \u00d7 10?14\nCeramic 0.70 24.90 1.0 3.3 \u00d7 10?14\n\n(a) the capillary pressure was measured using a buble test.\n\nThe results presented by Camargo (2004), showed that the CPL with a ceramic wick\n\nhad a successful started-up only for heat load of 10 W, but even though it did not reach\n\nthe stabilization. Moreover, the ceramic wick resulted in the worst performance when\n\ncompared to the other wicks (nickel, stainless steel and polyethylene).\n\nAccording to the results in Table 1.1, the ceramic wick supplies the greater pumping\n\ncapacity, however according to Camargo (2004), its low permeability has compromised\n\nthe performance of the CPL. Camargo (2004) concluded that the permeability of ceramic\n\nwicks should be increased for it to become a reliable component in capillary pumping\n\nsystems. Nevertheless, according to author knowledge of this thesis, the non successfull\n\noperation of the CPL was due to the manufacture of the capillary evaporator, mainly in\n\nthe insertion of the porous wick into the metallic envelop.\n\nBerti (2008) focused his work on the development of manufacturing routes of ceramic\n\nwicks in order to improve the ceramic wick manufactured by Reimbrecht (2004) and tested\n\nby Camargo (2004) before. The purpose of his work was to manufacture and characterize\n\nceramic wicks for capillary pumping applications. In this way, two manufacturing routes\n\nwere developed: slip casting and biotemplating. The ceramic wick manufactured by slip\n\ncasting resulted in porosity of 50%, pore size ranging from 1 to 3 \u00b5m providing capillary\n\npressure ranging from 80 to 22 kPa (using acetone) and permeability of 1.5 \u00d7 10?14 m2.\nThe ceramic wick manufactured by biotemplating resulted in porosity of 76% pore size\n\nranging from 33 to 194 \u00b5m providing capillary pressure ranging from 0.48 to 3 kPa (using\n\nacetone) permeability of 1.5 \u00d7 10?10 m2.\n\nBerti (2008) manufactured and tested two CPLs that used acetone as working fluid.\n\nThe CPL using ceramic wick manufactured by slip casting worked for heat load of 40\n\nW (3.93 W/cm2) and the other CPL using ceramic wick manufactured by biotemplating\n\nworked for heat load of 20 W (11.32 W/cm2). The CPLs worked satisfactorily, however\n\nBerti (2008) reported that he had many problems regarding the assembly of the capilary\n\nevaporator and also heat leak through the wall of evaporator to the liquid feeding channel\n\ndue to the geometry used for the flat capillary evaporators.\n\n\n\n1 Introduction 17\n\nSince the heat and mass transfer required for the working fluid circulation along the\n\nloop is the most important phenomenon in capillary evaporators, this is reviewed next.\n\nThe following section will present some geometries of capillary evaporators, the general\n\ndescription of physical phenomena that take place within the porous wick and the math-\n\nematical models proposed to solve the heat and mass transfer in capillary evaporators.\n\n1.4 Description of the Problem Under Investigation\n\nThe main component of capillary pumping systems (LHP and CPL) is the capil-\n\nlary evaporator. Micro-grooves or porous wicks are used in the evaporators as capillary\n\nstructures. Most CPLs and LHPs manufactured nowadays use porous wicks. There\n\nare basically two designs for cylindrical capillary evaporators, as shown in Fig. 1.9. A\n\ncylindrical evaporator with grooves machined in the metallic envelope is depicted in Fig.\n\n1.9(a), while in Fig. 1.9(b) it is shown a cylindrical evaporator with grooves machined in\n\nthe porous wick. Figure 1.10 depicts two flat evaporators, one with disk format and the\n\nother with square cross-section. In both evaporators shown in Fig. 1.10, the grooves are\n\nmachined in the metalic envelope.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 1.9 \u2013 (a) Cylindrical evaporator with grooves machined in the metallic envelope.\n(b) cylindrical evaporator with grooves machined in the porous wick.\n\nDuring operation, heat is applied to the external surface of the evaporator and the\n\nworking fluid within the wick undergoes evaporation. The vapor flows out of the evap-\n\norator along the grooves. The evaporation rate of the working fluid within capillary\n\nevaporators depends on the heat load applied to the system and can occur in three dif-\n\nferent regimes: (1) microfilm evaporation, (2) evaporation at the outer surface and (3)\n\nwithin the porous wick.\n\nThe uncertainty regarding the location of the evaporation front and the stablishment\n\nof capillary limits for the wick operation has motivated attempts to solve the mass and heat\n\n\n\n1 Introduction 18\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 1.10 \u2013 (a) Flat evaporator with cylindrical cross-section and (b) flat evaporator\nwith square cross-section.\n\ntransfer problem within the porous wick. Some of the theoretical modeling is reviewed\n\nbelow.\n\nCao &amp; Faghri (1994a) studied the evaporation in porous wicks under restrictive as-\n\nsumptions, that nevertheless, provided analytical solutions for the velocity and temper-\n\nature fields. They assumed that the wick was completely saturated by liquid and the\n\nevaporation front was located in the external surface. Their model also assumes that\n\nthe velocity field is uniform on the boundaries of the wick which is not exactly true as\n\nit will be shown bellow. They made a parametric analysis mostly directed to show that\n\ntheir analytical solution is accurate for most applications. Then, they concluded that the\n\nresults obtained are of relevance for the design of capillary evaporators.\n\nCao &amp; Faghri (1994b) reported an extension of their previous paper presenting an\n\nanalysis of a three-dimensional geometry. A numerical investigation was developed for\n\nstudying the flow of the liquid through the wick (two-dimensional) and the flow of the va-\n\npor through the grooves (three-dimensional). A comparison between the results obtained\n\nin both models for three working fluids (freon, water and ammonia) is presented and as\n\na consequence they concluded that the working fluid has a strong effect on the difference\n\nbetween the two- and three-dimensional models. For water, the difference was relatively\n\nlarge. For freon and ammonia, however, the differences are generally small, i.e., in this\n\ncase, the solutions obtained with the two-dimensional model are accurate and reliable.\n\nThey attribute these differences to the small vapor velocities for freon and ammonia (be-\n\nlow 2.5 m/s) in comparison to water vapor velocity (12.5 m/s) for a heat flux of 1.5\u00d7104\n\nW/m2. In both works published by Cao and Faghri, they state that the results obtained\n\nare of relevance for the design of capillary evaporators, however they do not present a\n\ncriterion for the dry-out of the porous wick, i.e., there is no information regarding the\n\ncritical heat flux before the failure of the capillary evaporator or at least a tendency for\n\n\n\n1 Introduction 19\n\nthat.\n\nDemidov &amp; Yatsenko (1994) made a theoretical investigation of the heat and mass\n\ntransfer problem in the porous wick of a capillary pumping system. In their analysis, the\n\nwick was heated by a heat flux from the fins in contact with the wick. In their model,\n\nthe fluid within the wick changes phase, developing a vapor-saturated region separated\n\nfrom a liquid-saturated region by a sharp evaporation front. At the evaporation front, the\n\ncontinuity of mass and heat and a jump in pressure due to capillary pressure is applied.\n\nA numerical solution of the mathematical model allowed to study the displacement of the\n\nevaporation front as the thermal load of the system varies.\n\nThey assumed that two limiting conditions are physically possible. For low heat load,\n\nthere is a small vapor saturated region trapped underneath the fin, Fig. 1.11(a). The\n\ncontinuity of the liquid phase with the groove would then allow for the presence of a\n\ncurved meniscus at the fin-wick contact line. All evaporation occurs in the wick-groove\n\ninterface. As the heat load increases, the fluid in the meniscus evaporates and there is\n\ncontinuity of the vapor phase from the vapor-saturated region to the groove. Evaporation\n\noccurs both in the vapor-saturated region and in the groove interface, Fig. 1.11(b).\n\nFigure 1.11 \u2013 Demidov &amp; Yatsenko (1994) model (a) low heat load and (b) higher heat\nload.\n\nAt the liquid saturated surface in contact with the groove, the same conditions used\n\nfor the evaporation front applies. The heat transfer to the vapor in the grooves is modeled\n\nusing a surface convection heat transfer coefficient. All mass flux reaching the surface is\n\nsuposed to evaporate absorbing the difference between the conductive heat flux from the\n\nwick and the convective heat flux to the vapor in the groove. The vapor phase in the\n\ngroove is assumed to exist under saturated condition [Tsat(pv)].\n\nThe evaporation on the meniscus is modeled assuming a global heat transfer coefficient\n\nthat includes a conductive thermal resistence accross the liquid film. The conduction heat\n\ntransfer in the fin is also solved. Their results show that the evaporation is far more intense\n\nat the wick-groove interface than it is at the evaporation front. This occurs because the\n\n\n\n1 Introduction 20\n\nflow of vapor out of the region underneath the fin is hindered by the low value of the\n\nvapor kinematic viscosity, as compared to the liquid kinematic viscosity, and the small\n\nsections available for flow near the fin-wick-groove triple line.\n\nMaximum heat loads are absorbed at the threshold between the two regimes, exactly\n\nwhen the boundary of the trapped vapor phase reaches the fin-wick-groove triple line.\n\nOnce the meniscus is dried-out, the heat load that can be absorbed reduces abruptly.\n\nThe authors do not present results of the value of the critical heat flux at the threshold\n\nfor the transition between the two limits. Only a qualitative analysis is presented.\n\nDemidov and Yatsenko\u2019s work presents a modeling effort that is plenty of physical\n\ninsights, however they did not quantify the limits of heat load for their porous wick. The\n\neffective properties, boundary conditions and dimensions are summarized in the table in\n\nFig. 1.15, but no value of heat load applied has been reported.\n\nFigus et al. (1999) analyzed a similar problem and attempted to quantify the change in\n\nevaporation regime as the heat load applied increased. In their work, the evaporation front\n\nis supposed to be immersed within the porous wick. They applied two different treatments:\n\na continuum model, similar to the one used by Demidov &amp; Yatsenko (1994), and a pore\n\nnetwork model, similar to the drying models developed earlier by Prat (1993, 1995) and\n\nLaurindo &amp; Prat (1996). The main difference in the formulation of the continuum model\n\nwhen compared to Demidov &amp; Yatsenko (1994) is that Figus et al. (1999) did not include\n\nthe evaporation at the wick-groove interface. All evaporation occurred within the wick.\n\nThey modeled the heat and mass transfer problem of a cross section of a cylindrical\n\nevaporator as shown in Fig. 1.12.\n\nAdditional differences in boundary conditions are that Tl is prescribed in the liquid\n\nside of the wick, the heat flux is prescribed at the wick-fin interface and the saturation\n\ntemperature is prescribed at the wick-groove interface. The results show that the fin\n\nsurface is far from isotherm, presenting a gradient of the order of 60oC/mm. Then,\n\nemphasis was placed on determining the conditions that lead to instability and fingering\n\nin the evaporation front. The continuum models do not capture these transitions since\n\nthey are not appropriate to model phenomena near the threshold for percolation (PRAT,\n\n1995), where small local fluctuations govern the development of the evaporation front.\n\nFigus et al. (1999) present solutions for a low effective thermal conductivity medium\n\n(?s = 4 W/m-K) and for a high thermal conductivity medium (?s = 10 W/m-K) as\n\nsummarized in the table in Fig. 1.15. For the low thermal conductivity medium, their\n\nresults show that when the pore size is constant and equal to 10\u00b5m, the vapor phase\n\ninvades the wick, i.e., forms a vapor-saturated region underneath the fin, only for q?? >\n\n\n\n1 Introduction 21\n\nC[ Fi`us et al[ : Int[ J[ Heat Mass Transfer 31 \"0888# 1446\u00d014581447\n\npump loops have been developed as an attractive system\nfor the thermal management of spacecraft with high\npower loads \u00f00?[ Typically\\ a CPL consists of an evap!\norator and a condenser interconnected by a system of\npipe \"Fig[ 0#[ Figure 1 shows the cross section of a classic\ncylindrical evaporator[ Under the in~uence of the heat\n\nFig[ 0[ Schematic of a CPL[\n\nFig[ 1[ Cylindrical evaporator[\n\nload applied on the external surface of the metallic\ngrooved structure\\ the liquid contained in the porous\nwick vaporizes\\ the vapor ~ows through the grooves\ntowards the condenser and the condensed liquid returns\nto the evaporator owing to the capillary pressure across\nthe meniscii that form at the surface or inside the porous\nwick[ By choosing a working ~uid having a large heat of\nvaporization\\ ammonia for example\\ one may expect to\ndissipate signi_cant heat ~ux[ In such a system\\ the evap!\norator is the most important part[ Therefore\\ the optimal\ndesign of CPL requires a thorough understanding of the\nphysical phenomena occurring within the evaporator[\nThis is the primary objective of the present paper[\nAdditionally\\ the in~uence of various factors\\ such as the\ntransport properties and:or the structural characteristics\nof the wick are partially explored[ Our study is not the\n_rst dedicated to this problem[ For basically the same\ntwo!dimensional system as the one considered in our\nstudy\\ Cao and Faghri \u00f01? developed an analytical solu!\ntion[ This solution is however restricted to homogeneous\nwicks and situations in which the wick is completely\nsaturated by liquid[ The fact of considering a two!dimen!\nsional model is supported by the numerical results pre!\nsented in \u00f02? \"note\\ however\\ that the results presented in\n\u00f02? were obtained within the framework of a continuum\nmodel and not pure network models#[ In that later study\\\nCao and Faghri presented a conjugate analysis of a sys!\ntem including a segment of wick and a groove[ In particu!\nlar\\ in~uence of the working ~uid on the vapor ~ow in\nthe groove was studied[ Again\\ this study was restricted\nto situations where the change of phase takes place at the\ngroove\u00d0wick interface and not within the wick[ The same\nyear\\ Demidov and Yatsenko \u00f03? presented a numerical\nstudy showing that vapor zones can take place within the\nwick under the _ns[ The study of Demidov and Yatsenko\nwas carried out at the continuum or Darcy level[ For the\npresent study\\ we developed a continuum level model\nwhich is similar to the one presented in \u00f03?[ Our method\nof solution is\\ however\\ di}erent[ In addition\\ we\ndeveloped a pore network model[ To the best of our\nknowledge\\ a pore network model has never been used\nbefore in the context of capillary evaporators[ The main\nmotivation for developing a pore network model stems\nfrom recent studies on liquid\u00d0vapor phase change in\ncapillary porous media\\ \u00f04\u00d06?[ These studies show that\nfractal patterns of the invasion percolation type \u00f07?\\ could\nbe expected when capillarity dominates the process \"in\nthe system under study\\ the capillary forces are clearly\nthe dominant forces#[ It is well known that the continuum\napproach to porous media is not adapted for modeling a\nsystem close to a percolation threshold[ In such a case\\\npore network models are much more appropriate[ In\nparticular\\ the pore network simulations show that capil!\nlary _ngering may lead to deprime of the evaporator\neven if the working conditions are far from the nominal\ncapillary capacity of the wick[ Also\\ it may be observed\n\n(a)\n\nC[ Fi`us et al[ : Int[ J[ Heat Mass Transfer 31 \"0888# 1446\u00d014581453\n\n)\n\n)CMYK Page 1453\n\nthat all bonds have the same width\\ d ? 09 mm and we\nimposed the same boundary conditions as for the con!\ntinuum model\\ Equations \"09#\u00d0\"03#\\ with f ? 4999 W\nm?1[ The physical properties of the various phases are\nequal to the ones used for the simulations with the con!\ntinuum model presented in Section 2[ Figure 09 shows\nthe solutions of the two approaches[ They are practically\nidentical[ The fact that both approaches lead to same\nresults is con_rmed in Fig[ 00 that shows the evolution\n\nFig[ 09[ Pore network simulation versus continuum model solution[ Liquid\u00d0vapor front position] black dot line*continuum model^\nwhite solid line*network model[ f ? 4999 W m?1^ DT ?

The solutions where explored for q?? as high as 90, 000 W/m2 and all the\n\nevaporation front developed with a smooth surface such that they are well predicted by\n\nthe continuum models.\n\nThen, a pore size distribution was assigned randonly to the pore space with average\n\n10\u00b5m and ratio of maximum to minimum pore size denoted by R = dmax/dmin. For\n\nthe higher thermal conductivity medium and R = 2, the vapor phase invades the wick\n\nat q?? = 1, 000 W/m2. Above this value, the front develops with irregular surface. For\n\nq?? from 15, 000 to 35, 000 W/m2, the front is pinned. After 35, 000 W/m2, the front\n\narea increases steadily until the breakthrough of the vapor accross the wick occurs at\n\nq?? = 200, 000 W/m2.\n\nThe invasion of the pore network occurs when the local vapor pressure overcome the\n\ncapillary limit for the pore. The final breakthrough occurs when even the smaller pore\n\nare overcome by the local vapor pressure. As the ratio R = dmax/dmin is increased, the\n\nfinal breakthrough occurs for even smaller values of q??. For their model, the position\n\nof the evaporation front and, therefore, the breakthrough, does not depend on the wick\n\nthermal conductivity. This is a result from their choice of imposing temperature boundary\n\nconditions.\n\nAparently, they also used a constant value for the surface tension, independent of\n\nthe local temperture. As the heat flux was increased, the fin temperature also increased,\n\nreaching values as high as 100 oC. They conclude discussing that this problem is similar\n\nto an invasion-percolation problem characterized by small cappilary number (Ca = v\u00b5/?)\n\n\n\n1 Introduction 22\n\nfor which, the vapor-liquid front develops as a stable fractal surface. As recomendation\n\nfor the design of porous wicks, they recomended (i) to use of materials with high thermal\n\nconductivity (?) to limit the fin temperature and high permeability medium as a layer\n\nnear the fin, followed by (ii) a second layer with low ? material and small pore size near\n\nthe liquid side.\n\nAlthough Figus et al. (1999) did not correlate the threshold for the wick failure,\n\nthey showed clearly the trend of the vapor invasion-percolation process. The local vapor\n\npressure depends on the solution of Darcy\u2019s equation for the porous wick. The local\n\ncritical (i.e., maximum) capillary pressure that a given pore can withstand is a function\n\nof the pore size and the surface tension, which is calculated locally from the medium\n\ntemperature. Therefore, the breakthrough criterion can be tested locally and whenever\n\nthe critical capillary pressure is exceeded, local dry-out occurs.\n\nTakahashi (2002) analyzed the heat and mass transfer with phase change in the cylin-\n\ndrical porous wick of a capillary evaporator (Fig. 1.13) in order to determine the maximum\n\nheat flux for steady-state operation of a CPL before its failure based on the capillary limit.\n\nTakahashi assumed as Figus et al. (1999), that the evaporation front develops within the\n\nwick. The differences between his work and the previous analysis (FIGUS et al., 1999) are\n\nthe inclusion of the capillary pressure jump at the liquid-vapor interface, the modification\n\nin a boundary condition and a simplification in the geometry. Takahashi (2002) solved\n\nnumerically the problem using the finite volume method in orthogonal curvilinear coor-\n\ndinates fitted to the evaporation interface. He used a tracking method of the evaporation\n\nfront combined with an adaptive mesh to this liquid-vapor interface.\n\nFigure 1.13 \u2013 (a) Cross-section of the capillary evaporator and (b) sector used in the\nanalysis, Takahashi (2002)\n\nTakahashi (2002) analized the ammonia as working fluid and obtained the properties\n\nfor the nickel wick manufactured by Reimbrecht et al. (1999). The maximum capillary\n\npressure was obtained from mercury porosimetry and from a drainage experiment. He\n\n\n\n1 Introduction 23\n\npresented results regarding the location of the evaporation front for different heat fluxes.\n\nBesides, he calculated a maximum heat flux for steady-state operation of 13.06 \u00d7 104\n\nW/m2. At this critical heat flux, the flow of liquid was 2.66 \u00d7 10?5 kg/s, the maximum\ntemperature difference (between fin and liquid channel) was 101 oC and the heat flux to\n\nthe liquid channel was 0.798 \u00d7 104 W/m2. His results compared well to those of Figus\net al. (1999). The values of the critical heat flux was calculated for different properties\n\n(maximum heat flux of 130613 W/ m2 for steady-state operation), but no attempt was\n\nmade of parametrization of the results obtained.\n\nKaya &amp; Goldak (2006) studied numerically the heat and mass transfer in the capillary\n\nporous structure of a loop heat pipe (LHP), presented in Fig. 1.14, with a focus on the\n\noccurrence of the boiling limit. The problem was basically the same as Demidov &amp;\n\nYatsenko (1994) and Figus et al. (1999) with a similar formulation. One difference in the\n\nformulation was that the model takes into account the convective terms in the energy\n\nequation. However, as shown by Cao &amp; Faghri (1994a) their contribution is expected to\n\nbe small. They also included the heat conduction in the fin and the envelope in their\n\nsolution. The heat load is prescribed as an uniform heat flux at the external surface of\n\nthe metalic envelope.\n\nFig. 5 represents the temperature field and liquid velo-\ncity vectors when the wick is completely saturated by liquid\nat Qin = 100 W. The solution is obtained by solving the\nmass conservation, Darcy and energy equations. At this\nheat load, by using the one-dimensional mathematical\nmodel, it is calculated that Tsat = 7.81 ?C and Dp = 247 Pa.\nAs the vapor flows along the grooves, it becomes super-\nheated due to the heating from the wall. Without solving\nthe vapor flow in the grooves using a three-dimensional\nmodel, it is not possible to calculate the vapor temperature\nin the grooves. Accurate experimental measurements are\nalso difficult although a range for the vapor superheat\ncan be deduced based on the wall-temperature measure-\nments. In our calculations, the vapor in the grooves is\nassumed to be superheated by 3 ?C. A similar approach\nis also used in Figus et al. [4]. Thus, Tv = 10.81 ?C and\nother related parameters for the calculations are as follows:\nPv = 569784.8 Pa, Pcore = 569537.8 Pa, qin = 1254 W m\n\n?2,\nkc = kw = 14.5 W m\n\n?1 K?1, keff = 6.073 W m\n?1 K?1, and\n\nhi = 2.733 \u00b7 10\n6 W m?2 K?1. The thermal properties of\n\nammonia are calculated at the saturation temperature for\na given applied power using the relations in [16]. In the\nnumerical calculations, the thermal properties are assumed\nconstant for a given saturation temperature.\n\nIt can be seen from Fig. 5 that, the working fluid evap-\norates at the wick interface under the applied heat load.\nThe liquid flows from the evaporator core into the wick\nand turns toward the interface under the fin. The heat flux\nalong the fin\u2013wick interface is not constant and varies\naround 2000 W m?2. In comparison, in the previously ref-\nerenced works [3\u20135] with an exception in [6], an estimated\nconstant heat flux is directly applied at the fin\u2013wick surface\nand the temperature drop across the casing is ignored due\nto the low thermal resistance. Applying the heat at the cas-\ning allows the calculation of the temperature distribution at\nthe casing surface. At low heat loads, the liquid velocity is\nrelatively small as well as the corresponding Peclet number\n(Pe = qinLwcpl/hfgkeff). For example, at Qin = 100 W, Pe is\non the order of 10?2. Therefore, the contribution from\nthe convective terms could be neglected. Therefore, in the\nearlier solutions [3\u20135], the Laplace equation for the temper-\nature is solved instead of the full energy equation. With this\nassumption, the Darcy and energy equations are also\ndecoupled, which significantly simplifies the solution algo-\nrithm. However, at higher heat loads, the convective terms\nneed to be taken account as is done in [6]. In our study, we\nkeep the convective terms in the governing equations and\nsolve together the mass conservation, Darcy and energy\nequations as a coupled problem.\n\nThe determination of the effective thermal conductivity\nof the wick keff is not trivial as it depends in a complex man-\nner on the geometry of the porous medium. The solution on\nFig. 5 is obtained by assuming that there is no heat transfer\nbetween the solid porous matrix and fluid (heat transfer in\nparallel). This is a well-known correlation obtained by the\nweighted arithmetic mean of kl and kw (keff = ukl + (1 ? u)\nkw), where u is the wick porosity. A number of relations for\nthe prediction of keff is proposed in the literature. To inves-\ntigate the effect of keff on the results, the same problem is\nsolved for the all-liquid wick case by using six different\ncorrelations in addition to the weighted arithmetic mean.\nThese are weighted harmonic (heat transfer in series) and\ngeometric means of the thermal conductivities of kw\nand kl, and other relations developed by Maxwell [17],\nKrupiczka [18], Zehner and Schlunder [19], and Alexander\n[20]. Fig. 6 represents the results obtained by using the dif-\nferent keff values at an arbitrarily chosen location of h = 80?.\nThe change of slope indicates the wick and fin interface. The\ntemperature profiles directly depend on keff. The series and\nparallel arrangements represent the highest and lowest con-\nductivities, respectively. The other relations are intermedi-\nate between these two. One specific difficulty is that the\ncorrelations produce significantly different values when\nthe thermal conductivities of the porous medium and fluid\nare greatly different from each other as previously studied\nin Nield [21]. As an example, the ratio of the thermal con-\nductivities for the liquid and vapor regions of the wick at\nTsat = 7.81 ?C are kl/kw = 0.0362 and kv/kw = 0.0017,\nrespectively. There is therefore further difficulty when both\nof the phases are present inside the wick. A given relation\nfor keff will not have the same accuracy for the liquid and\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n0 250 500 750\n\nApplied Heat (W)\n\n?\np\n\n (\nkP\n\na\n)\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nT\ns\na\nt  ( oC\n\n)\n\nFig. 4.

Goldak / International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer 49 (2006) 3211\u20133220\n\n(a)\n\nare calculated in the same way as previously explained for\nthe liquid-saturated wick. Because of the large density\ndifference between the liquid and vapor phases, the velocity\nfor each phase is significantly different. In plotting the\nresults, different scale factors are used for each phase as\nshown in Fig. 7. The highest velocities occur at the small\nsection of the wick\u2013groove border, which is the only out-\nflow boundary for the vapor generated at the interface\ninside the wick. The applied heat is carried to the vapor\u2013\nliquid interface mainly by conduction since the convection\ninside the vapor zone is weak and decreases with the grow-\ning size of the vapor region. The surface evaporation on the\nwick\u2013groove border of the liquid-saturated section is\nreduced in comparison to the solution obtained with the\nall-liquid wick. This is due to the fact that the applied heat\ndirectly flows to the most active region of the evaporation,\nwhich is now at the vapor\u2013liquid interface inside the wick.\n\nAs the applied heat load is increased, the vapor\u2013liquid\nfront inside the wick continues moving away from the fin\nand the size of the vapor region enlarges. Fig. 8 compares\nthe temperature profiles on the outer surface of the casing\nfor four different heat loads. In each case, not surprisingly,\nthe maximum temperature is reached at the mid-point on\nthe casing outer surface at h = 45?. The maximum temper-\nature increases with the applied heat load as expected. The\nvariation of (Tmax ? Tsat) as a function of the applied heat\nflux is shown in Fig. 9. The temperature difference increases\nwith the heat load. At low heat loads, the temperature\ndifference is small when the wick is completely liquid filled.\nThe first change in slope is due to the initiation of the vapor\nregion under the fin and the second change in slope occurs\nwhen the vapor region extends towards the groove past the\nfin corner region. The results presented in Fig. 9 are in\ngood agreement with the results of the pore network model\nreported in [4].\n\nThe above calculations assume that the nucleation is ini-\ntiated by vapor embryo trapped in the microcavities at the\nfin\u2013wick interface. As a result, the anticipated incipience\nsuperheats are small, on the order of 1\u20134 ?C. The boiling\n\nin the wick can be delayed to higher superheats by improv-\ning the contact between the fin and wick and purifying the\nworking fluid to the greatest extent possible. In microchan-\nnels, the superheat limit can be at the same order of mag-\nnitude as that for homogenous nucleation for a pure\nliquid [9]. According to Zhang et al. [24], this superheat\nlimit is the sufficient and necessary condition for the phase\nchange in microchannels. Zhang et al. [24] also explain that\nthe rate of phase change in microchannels is very rapid on\nthe order of milliseconds, resulting in explosive or flash-like\nevaporation. This phenomena is not observed for macro-\nchannels (several hundred microns and higher), where the\nrate of phase change is on the order of seconds. Without\nreferring to flash-like evaporation, Cao and Faghri [6] have\npreviously described that at high heat fluxes, the bubbles\ncould be expulsed at such high pressures that they may\ndestroy the capillary meniscus, leading to a boiling limit.\nThis is considered as a heat transfer limit since the wick\ndry-out is associated with the nucleate boiling in the wick.\nTo investigate such an explosive nucleation scenario, the\nsuperheat limit in a porous structure needs to be estimated.\n\nFig. 7.

Once the interface penetrates the\n\nwick, forming a vapor-saturated region underneath the fin, the authors consider that the\n\npressure jump across the interface must be smaller than the capillary pressure and not\n\nexactly equal, as required by the thermodynamic equilibrium at the vapor-liquid interface.\n\nThis violation is not justified.\n\nFuthermore, the authors needed to specify a surface superheating at the fin-wick\n\n\n\n1 Introduction 24\n\ninterface necessary to create a vapor-saturated region underneath the fin. They assumed\n\nthat once the surface temperature reaches 4 oC above the fluid saturation temperature\n\nat the liquid inlet pressure, a vapor region forms under the fin. It is noticed that this\n\ncriterion is rather arbitrary, since it does not include the local pore size, which alters\n\nthe local thermodynamic equilibrium, and it may change depending on fluid, fluid purity,\n\nsurface roughness and assembling technique. This could be used as a resonable nucleation\n\nhypothesis only when a gap with size larger than the nucleation bubble diameter for the\n\nfin roughness characteristic size would exist separating the wick from the fin, which is\n\nclearly not the case for CPLs and LHPs.\n\nTherefore, the results of Kaya &amp; Goldak (2006) are not reliable regarding the threshold\n\nfor formation of the vapor-saturated region. Once this region is formed, the results are\n\nan approximation for the front position, since the pressure jump has been neglected. One\n\ninteresting result presented is the difference between the outer surface temperature and\n\nthe saturation temperature in the vapor groove as a function of the applied heat flux. They\n\nmodeled a stainless-steel casing with thermal conductivity of 14.5 W/m-K and thickness\n\nof 2 mm. The calculated temperature difference ranged from 3 to 28 oC for surface heat\n\nflux from 1, 254 to 7, 528 W/m2.\n\nKaya &amp; Goldak (2006) attempt to further analyze the occurance of the boiling limit,\n\nbut this analysis is influenced by the hypothesis assumed. They conclude pointing out\n\nthat keeping a good thermal contact between the fin and the wick is more beneficial than\n\nallowing for small gaps as suggested elsewhere (FIGUS et al., 1999).\n\nFrom the background discussed above, summarized in the table in Fig. 1.15, some\n\nauthors assume that the evaporation front is located in the external surface of the wick\n\n(CAO; FAGHRI, 1994a, 1994b; KAYA; GOLDAK, 2006). This operation condition was ver-\n\nified experimentally by Li &amp; Ochterbeck (1999), which mentioned also that, in normal\n\noperation, the evaporation seldom occurs within the wick. This hypothesis was assumed\n\nby Cao &amp; Faghri (1994a, 1994b), but it was not tested theoretically. In both works, there\n\nis no information when the vapor invades the wick. In the problem studied by Kaya &amp;\n\nGoldak (2006), the formulation allows the stabilization of the evaporation front both at\n\nthe surface as well as within the porous wick. Once the interface penetrates the wick, they\n\nconsider that the pressure jump across the interface must be smaller than the capillary\n\npressure and not exactly equal and this violation is not justified. Besides, they assumed\n\nthat once the surface temperature reaches 4 oC above the fluid saturation temperature at\n\nthe liquid inlet pressure, a vapor region forms under the fin. This criterion is also rather\n\narbitrary.\n\nOn the other hand some authors assume that the evaporation front is located within\n\n\n\n1 Introduction 25\n\nthe wick (DEMIDOV; YATSENKO, 1994; FIGUS et al., 1999; TAKAHASHI, 2002). The model-\n\ning effort reported by Demidov &amp; Yatsenko (1994) is plenty of physical insights, however\n\nthey did not quantify the limits of heat load for their porous wick. Figus et al. (1999)\n\nassumed that evaporation front is immersed within the porous wick. Although Figus et\n\nal. (1999) did not correlate the threshold for the wick failure, they showed clearly the\n\ntrend of the vapor invasion-percolation process. Takahashi (2002) assumed as Figus et\n\nal. (1999), that the evaporation front develops within the wick. The differences between\n\nhis work and the previous analysis (FIGUS et al., 1999) are the inclusion of the capillary\n\npressure jump at the liquid-vapor interface, the modification in a boundary condition\n\nand a simplification in the geometry. He presented results regarding the location of the\n\nevaporation front for different heat fluxes.\n\nSo far, it is noticed that there is a lack of information regarding the limit of the evap-\n\noration front location, i.e., what is the maximum heat flux that the wick can withstand\n\nbefore that the evaporation front passes from external surface to inside the wick. As\n\nmentioned before, the evaporation front can stablish a stable position within the wick,\n\nbut this condition should be avoided. Thus, the model developed here allow to deter-\n\nmine when the evaporation front invades the porous wick, unlike the criterion assumed\n\nby Kaya &amp; Goldak (2006) (once the surface temperature reaches 4 oC above the fluid\n\nsaturation temperature at the liquid inlet pressure, a vapor region forms under the fin).\n\nIn the present model, a reliable criterion is assumed regarding the critical heat flux based\n\non the maximum capillary pressure that the porous wick can withstand. In the present\n\nmodel, the boundary conditions assumed by Cao &amp; Faghri (1994a, 1994b) are improved\n\nto match better with the expected physics of the problem.\n\nRegarding the experimental tests, most LHPs and CPLs used porous wicks made of\n\nmetal and ammonia as working fluid (which is considered the best fluid), as presented in\n\nthe previous review. The few applications of ceramic wicks in LHPs and CPLs did not\n\nhave success. Therefore, in lack of experiemental data regarding the successful application\n\nof ceramic wicks and the use of water as working fluid in LHPs and CPLs, in this work, an\n\nexperimental study of the thermal behaviour of two LHPs and one CPL using water and\n\nacetone as working fluid is presented. The ceramic wick manufactured by Berti (2008) is\n\nproposed as an alternative to wicks made of metal and polymers for this application.\n\n\n\n1 Introduction 26\n\n \n \n\nEf\nfe\n\nct\niv\n\ne \nPr\n\no\np\n\ner\ntie\n\ns \nB.\n\nC\n.

The first is the development of a\n\nmathematical model for the heat and mass transfer problem which occurs within the\n\nporous wick of evaporators of capillary pumping systems. This model allows to verify\n\nthe effect of design variables, such as working fluids, dimensions, permeability, average\n\npore radius and thermal conductivity of the wick, in the performance of the capillary\n\nevaporator and it allows for establishing a rigorous criterion for the wick dry-out limit.\n\nThe second is the application of ceramic porous wick in capillary pumping systems such\n\nas LHPs and CPLs followed by the evaluation of their thermal behavior during the start\n\nup and at steady state conditions for different inclinations. Water and acetone are used\n\nas working fluids.\n\nThe thesis is divided into five chapters as follows:\n\n1. Chapter 1 (Introduction) describes the operation of capillary pumping systems\n\n(LHPs and CPls). It also presents a literature survey about the recent experi-\n\nments in CPL and LHP, the application of ceramic wick in CPLs and the recent\n\nmathematical models for heat and mass transfer in capillary evaporators.\n\n2. Chapter 2 (Theoretical Analisys) deals with the formulation of the heat and mass\n\ntransfer problem within porous wick of capillary evaporators. Two models are pre-\n\nsented. One is solved analytically (Simplified Model) while the other is solved\n\nnumerically (Improved Model). The solutions aim at verifying the effect of design\n\nvariables, such as working fluids, dimensions, permeability, average pore radius and\n\nthermal conductivity of the wick, in the performance of the capillary evaporators\n\nand also in stablishing the criterion for dry-out.\n\n3. Chapter 3 (Experiment) presents the manufacturing of the CPL and two LHPs.\n\nTwo tests rigs, one at Laboratory of Combustion and Thermal Systems Engineering\n\n(LABCET) of UFSC in Brazil and the other at Institute of Nuclear Technology and\n\nEnergy Systems (IKE) of Stuttgart University in Germany, were built.\n\n4. Chapter 4 (Experimental Results and Analysis) presents the experimental study of\n\nthe thermal behaviour of two LHPs and one CPL. Performance tests of two LHPs\n\nusing acetone and water as working fluids were carried out for power inputs up to\n\n25 W and performance tests of one CPL using water were carried out for power\n\ninputs up to 30 W. An analysis of the capillary limit of these systems based on their\n\nexperimental results and a comparison between the theoretical and experimental\n\nresults are also presented.\n\n\n\n1 Introduction 28\n\n5. Chapter 5 (Conclusions and Recommendations for Future Work) presents the gen-\n\neral conclusions as well as some suggestion for development of future works in mod-\n\neling of heat and mass transfer in capillary evaporators and in the design of LHP\n\nand CPL systems.\n\n\n\n29\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys\n\nThis chapter presents the problem formulation of the heat and mass transfer within\n\nporous wick of capillary evaporators. For the modeling, the porous wick is a flat circular\n\ndisc and is assembled between the liquid feeding channel and the vapor chamber. Figure\n\n2.1 presents a rendering of the porous wick modeled. The upper part of the wick is\n\nheated by an external heat flux. The evaporation process that takes place in the wick\n\nof the capillary evaporator depends on the applied thermal load on the system and it is\n\nassumed that it may occur in three regimes: microfilm evaporation, evaporation at the\n\nexternal surface of the wick and evaporation within the wick.\n\nFigure 2.1 \u2013 Cross-section view of the flat capillary evaporator with cylindrical geometry.\n\nFigure 2.2 presents a unit cell formed by a half of a single fin and the region of the\n\nporous wick bounded by the two symmetry surfaces. In Fig. 2.2(a), an external heat\n\nflux is supplied to the capillary evaporator and a liquid microfilm is formed between the\n\nexternal surface of the porous wick and the vapor grooves as modeled by Demidov &amp;\n\nYatsenko (1994). Since the inner surface temperature of the fin is higher than the liquid\n\ntemperature, the liquid microfilm tends to dry out. After the microfilm dries out, the\n\nevaporation interface migrates to the external surface of the porous wick, as depicted in\n\nFig. 2.2(b). If the thermal load continues increasing, a capillary pressure threshold is\n\nreached and the evaporation front moves to within the porous wick, as shown in Fig.\n\n2.2(c). Here, only the evaporation regime in the external surface of the wick is studied.\n\nFollowing Li &amp; Ochterbeck (1999), this is the safest operation condition.\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 30\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\nFigure 2.2 \u2013 (a) Microfilm evaporation (b) evaporation at the outer surface and (c) evap-\noration within the porous wick.\n\nThe models developed here will be used to simulate the heat and mass transfer within\n\na wick with one and two layers with different thermophysical properties and working fluids.\n\nThe mass and heat transfer problems are modeled by the volume averaged equations of\n\nenergy and mass conservation. Further information concerning the the volume averaging\n\nmethod can be found in Appendix A.\n\nTwo models are developed. In the first model, the equations are analytically solved\n\nusing the superposition and variable separation methods. This model is based on the\n\nmodel reported by Cao &amp; Faghri (1994a). An analisys on the limitations of this model\n\nis presented. In the second model, the equations are numerically solved using the finite\n\nvolume method. This second model allows to verify the effect of design variables, di-\n\nmensions, permeability, average pore radius and thermal conductivity of the wick in the\n\nperformance of the flat capillary evaporator. Furthermore, the second model also allows\n\nthe test of the onset of drying underneath the fin, defining the limit for the operation of\n\nthe capillary evaporator.\n\nFor both models, the equations of conservation of energy and mass in volume average\n\nwere cast in cylindrical coordinates and the following assumptions were made:\n\n? the process is steady state;\n\n? the porous layers forming the wick are isotropic and homogeneous;\n\n? there is a negligible influence of gravity;\n\n? there are no heat transfer by radiation nor energy generation (besides the surface\n\nphase change);\n\n? the solid phase is inert and stationary;\n\n? the fluid (liquid and its vapor) is incompressible;\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 31\n\n? the thermophysical properties are constant;\n\n? the solid phase is in local thermal equilibrium with the liquid phase;\n\n? there are no chemical reactions.\n\nThe volume averaged equation for the conservation of mass of liquid for incompressible\n\nfluid in cylindrical coordinates, becomes:\n\n1\n\nr\n\n? (r vr)\n\n?r\n+\n?vz\n?z\n\n= 0 (2.1)\n\nHere, the volume averaged notation is omitted for simplicity. The formulation of the\n\nconservation of linear momentum equation depends on the flow velocity. It has been\n\nshown before (DEMIDOV; YATSENKO, 1994; CAO; FAGHRI, 1994b; FIGUS et al., 1999) that\n\nthe flow velocity in the application of interest here is small. The pore Reynolds number\n\ncan be estimated and ranges from 4.0 \u00d7 10?5 to 4.0 \u00d7 10?4. Therefore, macroscopic and\nmicroscopic (Forchheimer) inertia terms are negligible when compared to the microscopic\n\nviscous terms (KAVIANY, 1995). Also, since boundary effects penetrate distances that\n\nare of the order of a few particle diameters, the macroscopic (Brinkman) viscous term is\n\nalso neglected. Finally, neglecting the influence of gravity, the r and z components of the\n\nequation for the conservation of linear momentum reduce to Darcy\u2019s Law, i.e.,\n\nvr = ?\nK\n\n\u00b5\n\n?p\n\n?r\n(2.2)\n\nvz = ?\nK\n\n\u00b5\n\n?p\n\n?z\n(2.3)\n\nwhere K is the permeability and \u00b5 is the dynamic viscosity. Substituting the conservation\n\nof momentum equation in the conservation of mass equation, we obtain,\n\n1\n\nr\n\n?\n\n?r\n\n(\nr\nK\n\n\u00b5\n\n?p\n\n?r\n\n)\n+\n\n?\n\n?z\n\n(\nK\n\n\u00b5\n\n?p\n\n?z\n\n)\n= 0 (2.4)\n\nwhich reduces to a Laplace equation for the pressure when the properties are assumed\n\nconstant.\n\nSince the fluid velocity is relativily small, the dispersion tensor can be neglected.\n\nThen, the total energy equation for liquid and solid phases is written as,\n\nvr\n?T\n\n?r\n+ vz\n\n?T\n\n?z\n=\n\n?e\n?lcp,l\n\n[\n1\n\nr\n\n?\n\n?r\n\n(\nr\n?T\n\n?r\n\n)\n+\n?2T\n\n?z2\n\n]\n, (2.5)\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 32\n\nwhere ?e is the effective thermal conductivity.\n\nThe boundary conditions will be presented in the context of the two models. The first,\n\na simplified model, will employ a set of boundary conditions that allows an analytical\n\nsolution. The second, a more comprehensive model, will require a numerical solution.\n\n2.1 Simplified Model\n\nIn the current section, analytical solutions for the velocity and temperature fields\n\nwithin the porous wick of a flat capillary evaporator are presented. The model developed\n\nis based on the model reported by Cao &amp; Faghri (1994a), but the properties of the porous\n\nwicks and the working fluids used are more realistic.\n\nThe calculation domain and the boundary conditions are represented schematically in\n\nFig. 2.3. Due to the cylindrical symmetry of the evaporator, only a section represented\n\nby a dotted line in Fig.2.3(a) is modeled.\n\nThe boundary conditions for velocity and temperature are:\n\nAt r = 0 and r = R : vr = 0 and\n?T\n\n?r\n= 0 (2.6)\n\nAt z = 0 : vz = vz,in and T = Tin (2.7)\n\nAt z = Lz and 0 ? r ?

The problem is linear and the boundary conditions suggest the\n\nuse of the method of separation of variables (ARPACI, 1966). Since the governing equation\n\nand boundary conditions are linear, the problem is subdivided into two simpler problems,\n\naccording to Fig. 2.4.\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 35\n\nFigure 2.4 \u2013 Schematic subdivision of the general problem of the flowing into the wick.\n\nThe general solution of the problem is given by the sum of solutions of problems I\n\nand II:\n\np+ = p+1 + p\n+\n2 ??\n\n2p+ = 0 ??2p+1 = 0 and ?\n2p+2 = 0 (2.24)\n\nProblem I:\n\n?2p+1\n?r2+\n\n+\n1\n\nr+\n?p+1\n?r+\n\n+\n?2p+1\n?z2+\n\n= 0 (2.25)\n\n?p+1\n?r+\n\n= 0,\n(\nr+ = 0 and r+ = R+\n\n)\n(2.26)\n\n?p+1\n?z+\n\n= ?(Re Pr) v+z,in,\n(\nz+ = 0\n\n)\n(2.27)\n\n?p+1\n?z+\n\n= ?(Re Pr) v+z,in,\n(\nz+ = L+z and 0 &lt;r\n\n+ ?

The\n\nPeclet number relates the convective and diffusive effects, and it can be written as:\n\nPe = Re Pr =\nvz,inR\n\n?\n\n?e\n, where ?e =\n\n?e\n?lcp,l\n\n(2.39)\n\nIn order to evaluate the Peclet number, it is necessary to know the value of vz,in. For\n\nthat, a mass and energy balance is applied in the wick. From this balance represented in\n\nFig.2.5, the following expressions are obtained.\n\nFigure 2.5 \u2013 Energy balance within the porous wick.\n\nEnergy balance:\n\nqinAin,fin +\n\n[(\n??e\n\n?T\n\n?z\n\n????\nz=0\n\n)\n+ ?lvz,inhl,in\n\n]\nAin,l = [qlost,vapor + ?lvz,outhv,out] Aout,vapor\n\n(2.40)\n\nMass Balance:\n\n?lvz,inAin,l = ?lvz,outAout,vapor =\n.\nmlv (2.41)\n\nSubstituting Eq. 2.41 in 2.40, we obtain,\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 38\n\nqinAin,fin ??e\n?T\n\n?z\n\n????\nz=0\n\nAin,l = qlost,vaporAout,vapor +\n.\nmlv [?hlv + cp,l (Tv,out ?Tl,in)] (2.42)\n\nAssuming that qlost,vapor = 0, ??e\n?T\n\n?z\n\n????\nz=0\n\nAin,l ?\n.\nmlv?hlv and neglecting the sensible\n\nheat, Eq. 2.42 becomes,\n\nqinAin,fin ?=\n.\nmlv?hlv (2.43)\n\nAssuming the inlet velocity of the liquid is distributed uniformly, we obtain,\n\nvz,in ?=\nqinAin,fin\n?l?hlvAin,l\n\n(2.44)\n\nThe velocity and heat flux at the outlet are calculated by the following expressions:\n\nqinAin,fin = qoutAout,vapor ? qout =\nqinAin,fin\nAout,vapor\n\n(2.45)\n\n?lvz,inAin,l = ?lvz,outAout,vapor ? vz,out =\nvz,inAin,l\nAout,vapor\n\n(2.46)\n\nUsing Eq. 2.44 to estimate vz,in, the Peclet number (RePr) is estimated to be of\n\nthe order of 10?1 to 10?2 for the inlet heat flux from 103 to 105 W/m2 (working fluid\n\nis water at the saturation temperature of 50 \u00b0C). Therefore, for this range of heat flux,\n\nthe convective terms in Eq. 2.14 can be neglected. With this approximation, the energy\n\nequation is reduced to the Laplace equation,\n\n1\n\nr+\n?T +\n\n?r+\n+\n?2T +\n\n?r+2\n+\n?2T +\n\n?z+2\n= 0 (2.47)\n\nUsing the method of separation of variables, the solution of Eq. 2.47 subjected to the\n\nboundary conditions in Eqs. 2.15 to 2.18 is:\n\nT +\n(\nr+,z+\n\n)\n=\n\n??\nm=1\n\n2R (qin + qout) J1\n\n(\n?mR\n\n?+\n\nR+\n\n)\nJ0\n\n(?m\nR+\n\nr+\n)\nsinh\n\n(?m\nR+\n\nz+\n)\n\n?2m?esinh\n(?m\nR+\n\nL+z\n\n)\n[J0 (?m)]\n\n2\n(2.48)\n\nFinally, returning to the original variables, the solution for the temperature field is:\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 39\n\nT (r,z) =\n??\nm=1\n\n2R (qin + qout) J1\n\n(\n?mR\n\n?\n\nR\n\n)\nJ0\n\n(?m\nR\nr\n)\nsinh\n\n(?m\nR\nz\n)\n\n?2m?esinh\n(?m\nR\nLz\n\n)\n[J0 (?m)]\n\n2\n+ Tin (2.49)\n\nThe application of the solution above follows. First, the properties of the working\n\nfluid, the dimensions of the wick and the inlet flux are supplied. Then, the inlet velocity\n\nis calculated from Eq. 2.44, the heat flux at the outlet is calculated from Eq. 2.45 and the\n\noutlet velocity is calculated from Eq. 2.46. Subsequently, these results are substituted in\n\nEqs. 2.36, 2.37, 2.38 and 2.49 for the calculation of the pressure, velocity components in\n\ndirections r and z and temperature fields, respectively. The equations are solved using\n\nMaple 10 and the properties are obtained from EES (Engineering Equation Solver).\n\n2.1.3 Results and Discussion\n\nResults are presented here for two working fluids, water and acetone, and for three\n\nporous wicks, stainless steel, nickel and ceramic. The properties of the wick and the\n\nworking fluids are presented in Tables 2.1 and 2.2, respectively.

The properties of the working fluids were obtained by the software Engineering Equation Solver\n(EES) and ?? from Peterson (1994) at Tsat = 40 oC.\n\nmagnitude of heat flux and pressure are typical of applications. The dimensions of the wick\n\nare: R = 15 mm, R\n?\n= 7.5 mm, Lz = 10 mm. The velocity vectors, always perpendicular\n\nto the isobaric lines, remain pointed upwards until the middle of the structure, where they\n\nbegin to change the direction toward the outlet of the wick due to the impermeability of\n\nthe metallic fin.\n\nFigure 2.6 \u2013 Velocity vectors and isobaric lines in the wick for an inlet heat flux of 2.0\u00d7104\nW/m2.\n\nFigure 2.7 presents the isothermal and heat flux lines for an inlet heat flux of 2.0\u00d7104\n\nW/m2. Note that most of the heat flows to the outlet where evaporation takes place, while\n\nthe remaining heat flows right to the feeding liquid channel. Note also that there is heat\n\nflux from the liquid feeding channel to the vapor channel. This is a limitation of the\n\nmodel which is due to the boundary conditions assumed for solving it. This limitation\n\nwill be explored further later on in this section.\n\nFigures 2.8 presents the temperature profiles at z = Lz (surface at the vapor channel)\n\nfor the three types of wicks saturated with water and acetone, for an inlet heat flux of\n\n2.0 \u00d7 104 W/m2. The results for water are shown in Fig. 2.8(a) and for acetone in Fig.\n2.8(b) for different solid phases. It is noticed that the smaller the thermal conductivity\n\nof the wick, the higher the temperature in the area underneath the fin. This happens\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 41\n\nFigure 2.7 \u2013 Isotherm lines and heat streamlines for an inlet heat flux of 2.0\u00d7104 W/m2.\n\ndue to the increase in the heat transfer resistance of the porous structure. This larger\n\ntemperature can cause the formation of vapor bubbles in the area underneath the fin,\n\ncausing a possible failure by dryout. Later, a criterion for dryout will be stablished.\n\nFigure 2.9 presents the heat fluxes at z = 0 for different thickness (Lz) and radius of\n\nthe fin (R\n?\n). For these results, an inlet heat flux of 2.0 \u00d7 104 W/m2, water as a working\n\nfluid and a ceramic wick were used. It is noticed that the larger the thickness of the wick,\n\nthe smaller the heat flux to the liquid channel. Note that here the temperature at the\n\nchannel has been kept uniform at Tin. For lager heat flux there would be a superheating\n\nof this surface which could lead to boiling. The onset of the boiling limit in the channel\n\nwill not be analyzed in this work.\n\nThe negative values of the heat fluxes, presented in Fig. 2.9 for 0 ? r ? 9 mm,\nindicate that there is a heat transfer from the porous wick to the liquid feeding channel.\n\nHowever these values become positive for r > 9 mm. This indicates that there is a heat\n\ntransfer from the liquid feeding channel to the porous wick. This heat transfer is evident\n\nin Fig. 2.10(a), in which it is shown that the inlet temperature is larger than the outlet\n\ntemperature in the vapor outlet of the porous wick for r > 9 mm (hatched area). Figures\n\n2.10(a) and (b) were produced using the same conditions as in Figs. 2.9(a) and (b). Figure\n\n2.10(b) shows the heat fluxes lines from the liquid feeding channel to the vapor outlet.\n\nSince the fin is the only source of heat in the system, this condition does not represent the\n\nphysics of the problem and it limits the model for a practical application. This is going\n\nto be improved in the following model.\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 42\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2.8 \u2013 Temperature profiles at z = Lz for different wicks using (a) water and (b)\nacetone for an inlet heat flux of 2.0 \u00d7 104 W/m2.\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 43\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2.9 \u2013 Heat fluxes at z = 0, for (a) different thicknesses of the wick (Lz) and (b)\ndifferent radii of the fin (R\n\n?\n).\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 44\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2.10 \u2013 (a) Temperatures at z = 0 and z = Lz and (b) isotherm lines and heat\nstreamlines for an inlet heat flux of 2.0 \u00d7 104 W/m2.\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 45\n\n2.1.4 Conclusion\n\nThe model developed here allowed to verify the effect of design variables in the perfor-\n\nmance of a capillary evaporator. The analysis of the different types of wicks, working fluids\n\nand the variation of some geometric parameters provided important information such as:\n\nthe decrease of the wick thickness increased the capillary limit, however increased both\n\nthe temperature in the area close to the fin and the heat flux to the feeding liquid channel.\n\nAlso, as expected, it was noticed that the smaller the thermal conductivity of the wick,\n\nthe greater the temperatures in the area underneath the fin.\n\nTherefore, from the variation of the parameters, thickness and thermal conductivity,\n\nwe can conclude that for a proper design of a capillary evaporator one must determine:\n\n1. an optimum thickness and a high permeability so that the heat flux to the feeding\n\nliquid channel is minimized and the pressure losses remain low;\n\n2. a porous material with optimum thermal conductivity so that the temperature in\n\nthe area underneath the fin is minimized. While, at the same time, the temperature\n\nin the surface of the liquid channel is also limited. This contradictory need was also\n\nobserved by Figus et al. (1999) that recomended the use of a double layered porous\n\nwick.\n\nThis model allows no conclusions regarding the attainment of a capillary limit and\n\nthe boundary conditions should be improved to match better with the expected physics\n\nof the problem. It is expected that:\n\n1. the outlet velocity field is not uniform but it must result in higher velocities closer\n\nto the fin;\n\n2. the liquid channel surface temperature must be smaller than the vapor temperature.\n\nFor this improvement, the model proposed in the next section is solved numerically,\n\ndue to the nonlinearities that will appear. With this improved model, it is possible\n\nto simulate the heat and mass transfer within the wick with more than one layer with\n\ndifferent thermophysical properties. This improved model will also provide a condition\n\nfor dryout.\n\n2.2 Improved Model\n\nThis section presents an extension of the model developed in the previous section.\n\nHere, a numerical evaluation of heat and mass transfer in the porous wick of a flat capillary\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 46\n\nevaporator is presented. The model was used to simulate the heat and mass transfer within\n\na wick with two layers with different thermophysical properties. The model allows to verify\n\nthe effect of design variables, dimensions, permeability, average pore radius and thermal\n\nconductivity of the wick in the performance of the flat capillary evaporator. Furthermore,\n\nthe model allows the test of the onset of drying underneath the fin, defining the limit for\n\nthe application of the model which considers the wick fully saturated with liquid.\n\nThe problem domain and the boundary conditions are represented schematically in\n\nFig. 2.11. Due to the cylindrical symmetry of the evaporator, only the section represented\n\nby a dotted line in Fig.2.3 (a) is modeled.\n\nFigure 2.11 \u2013 Schematic diagram of the problem domain and the boundary conditions.\n\nIn the volume-averaged equation and assuming local thermal equilibrium between the\n\nliquid and solid phases, ?e is the effective thermal conductivity of fully liquid saturated\n\nporous medium. For constant property, isotropic media, the conservation of thermal\n\nenergy equation reduces to a Laplace equation for the temperature. Following the system\n\nof coordinates (r,z) depicted in Fig. 2.11, the boundary conditions are as follows.\n\nAt the surface at r = 0, cylindrical symmetry requires that:\n\n?p\n\n?r\n= 0 and\n\n?T\n\n?r\n= 0 (2.50)\n\nAt the surface at r = R the boundary is assumed impermeable to liquid flow and\n\nadiabatic. Then,\n\n?p\n\n?r\n= 0 and\n\n?T\n\n?r\n= 0 (2.51)\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 47\n\nAt the inlet surface at z = 0, the porous wick is fed with a liquid flow with far end\n\ntemperature Tl,in, i.e.,\n\np = pl,in and ??e\n?T\n\n?z\n+ ?lvz,incpT = ?lvz,incpTl,in (2.52)\n\nThis temperature boundary condition reflects the continuity of the total normal com-\n\nponent of the heat flux vector. Finally, at the outlet surface, two regions are observed.\n\nFirst, underneath the metallic fin (z = Lz and 0 ? r ? R\n?\n),\n\n?p\n\n?z\n= 0 and ??e\n\n?T\n\n?z\n= qin (2.53)\n\nSecond, considering the evaporation at the outlet surface, assuming that the pore size\n\nis not extremely small, i.e., this is not a hygroscopic porous medium, from Kelvin\u2019s Law,\n\nthe surface temperature is approximately equal to the vapor saturation temperature in the\n\nbulk of the vapor channel. Also, the conduction heat transfer from the fin is responsible\n\nfor the liquid evaporation. Therefore, we have,\n\n?p\n\n?z\n=\n\n\u00b5?e\nK?lhlv\n\n?T\n\n?z\nand T = Tsat (pv) (2.54)\n\nThis set of boundary conditions closes the formulation. The pressure difference (pv ?\npl,in) corresponds to the total pressure loss of the CPL components. In all stable operation\n\npoints, this pressure difference balances exactly the capillary pressure difference across the\n\nmedium. The total heat transfer rate at the fin is responsible for the liquid evaporation\n\nat the outlet surface and part of it flows to the liquid channel. A total energy balance in\n\nthe wick provides:\n\nQin = Qout,l + Qlv\n\nwhere Qin is the heat transfer rate at the fin surface,\n\nQin = qinAin\n\nThe heat transfer rate to the liquid channel Qout,l, following Eq. 2.52, is given by,\n\nQout,l =\n\n? R\n0\n\n(\n?e\n?T\n\n?z\n\n)\nrdr, at z = 0.\n\nThis heat transfer is responsible for raising the incoming flow temperature from the\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 48\n\nfar end value Tin to the porous wick surface value T(z = 0). Then, the heat transfer rate\n\nactually used for the liquid evaporation is,\n\nQlv =\n\n? R\nR\n\n?\n\n(\n??e\n\n?T\n\n?z\n\n)\nrdr, at z = Lz.\n\nNote that the total liquid mass flow rate is,\n\n.\nmlv =\n\n[? R\nR\n\n?\n\n(\n?\nK\n\n\u00b5\n\n?p\n\n?z\n?l\n\n)\nrdr\n\n]\nz=Lz\n\nor\n\n.\nmlv =\n\n[? R\n0\n\n(\n?\nK\n\n\u00b5\n\n?p\n\n?z\n?l\n\n)\nrdr\n\n]\nz=0\n\n(2.55)\n\nWhen Qout,l is large, the liquid in the channel can reach the onset of nucleate boiling\n\nwhich is called a boiling limit for the CPL operation. In the evaporation front (liquid-vapor\n\ninterface), located in the external surface of the wick, the pressure difference between the\n\nphases liquid and vapor is the capillary pressure, which in its turn, can be expressed\n\nby the Young-Laplace\u2019s equation (?pcap = pv ? pl =\n2? cos ?\n\nr\n). For an averaged pore\n\nradius rp, the capillary pressure becomes maximum when the contact angle between the\n\nliquid and the solid approaches zero, in other words, when the wettability of the working\n\nfluid is maximum. Since the objective here is to explore the maximum pumping capacity,\n\nthe contact angle is considered equal to zero. At the evaporation interface, the capillary\n\npressure is defined by the liquid and vapor pressure. Then, the average radius of curvature\n\nof the liquid-vapor interface adjusts itself in order to balance this capillary pressure, as\n\npredicted by Young-Laplace\u2019s equation above. The minimum possible radius of curvature\n\nbefore drying of the pore is the characteristic radius of the pore (rp). This radius depends\n\non the pore topology and is determined by the choice of material and manufacturing\n\nprocess, i.e., sintering, used to produce the porous wicks. The maximum capillary pressure\n\nthat the wick can withstand is therefore,\n\n?pcap,max =\n2?\n\nrp\n(2.56)\n\nThis maximum capillary pressure is related to the threshold for percolation of the non-\n\nwetting phase and is commonly identified as the wick bubbling pressure. In the operation\n\nof a capillary evaporator, when the pressure losses of the system exceed the maximum\n\ncapillary pressure, the wick dry-out begins leading to the system failure. Therefore, the\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 49\n\ncapillary limit of a CPL reflects its maximum pumping capacity. Before moving to the\n\nsolution, a different nondimensionalization is proposed.\n\n2.2.1 Nondimensional equations\n\nUdell (1983) studied the heat and mass transfer in a problem that resembles the oper-\n\nation of a heat pipe. Following Udell (1983), the nondimensional variables are proposed:\n\npref =\n?\n\n(K/?)1/2\n, vref =\n\n(K?)1/2?\n\n\u00b5lLz\n, qref =\n\n?e(Tv ?Tl)\nLz\n\nPe =\n?lcp,l(K?)\n\n1/2?\n\n\u00b5l?e\n, Ev =\n\n?e (Tv ?Tl) \u00b5l\n?lhlv (K?)\n\n1/2\n?\n\nr? =\nr\n\nR\n, z? =\n\nz\n\nLz\n, T? =\n\nT ?Tl\nTv ?Tl\n\np? =\np\n\npref\n, v?r =\n\nvr\nvref\n\n, v?z =\nvz\nvref\n\n, q?in =\nqin\nqref\n\nThis nondimensionalization is based on the assumption that (K/?)1/2 provides a suit-\n\nable order of magnitude for the average pore size. From this estimative, pref is a reference\n\nvalue for the liquid pressure, vref is a reference value for the liquid velocity and qref is a\n\nreference value for the heat flux.\n\nThe nondimensional conservation equations and boundary conditions become:\n\nEquation of conservation of thermal energy,\n\n?2T?\n\n?z?2\n+\nL2z\nR2\n\n1\n\nr?\n?\n\n?r?\n\n(\nr?\n?T?\n\n?r?\n\n)\n= 0, (2.57)\n\nBoundary conditions,\n\nz? = 0, ?\n?T?\n\n?z?\n+ Pev?z,in T\n\n? = 0,\n\nz? = 1, 0 ? r? ? r\n??, ?\n\n?T?\n\n?z?\n= ?\n\nqinLz\n?e (Tv ?Tl)\n\n= ?q?in\n\nz? = 1, r\n?? ? r? ? 1, T? = 1\n\nr? = 0,\n?T?\n\n?r?\n= 0\n\nr? = 1,\n?T?\n\n?r?\n= 0\n\nEquation of conservation of mass,\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 50\n\n?2p?\n\n?z?2\n+\nL2z\nR2\n\n1\n\nr?\n?\n\n?r?\n\n(\nr?\n?p?\n\n?r?\n\n)\n= 0, (2.58)\n\nBoundary conditions,\n\nz? = 0, p? = p?l,in\n\nz? = 1, 0 ? r? ? r\n??,\n\n?p?\n\n?z?\n= 0\n\nz? = 1, r\n?? ? r? ? 1, Ev\n\n?T?\n\n?z?\n=\n?p?\n\n?z?\n\nr? = 0,\n?p?\n\n?r?\n= 0\n\nr? = 1,\n?p?\n\n?r?\n= 0\n\nThe parameters that controls the solution are:\nLz\nR\n\n; v?z,in; q\n?\nin;\n\nR?\n\nR\n; p?l,in; Ev.\n\nThe capillary-evaporation number (Ev) is the ratio of conduction heat flux to the\n\nenergy rate consumed by the evaporation of the capillary-driven liquid flow. This number\n\nprovides the relation between the nondimensional liquid pressure and temperature gradi-\n\nents at the evaporation surface. Also, the capillary pressure and the pore radius can be\n\ncast in nondimensional form as,\n\n?p?cap =\n?pcap (K/?)\n\n1/2\n\n?\n=\n\n(pv ?pl) (K/?)\n1/2\n\n?\n(2.59)\n\nand\n\nr?p =\nrp\n\n(K/?)\n1/2\n\n(2.60)\n\n2.2.2 Numerical Solution\n\nThe conservation equations were solved numerically by the finite volume method\n\n(PATANKAR, 1980; MALISKA, 2004). The tri-diagonal matrix algorithm (TDMA) was\n\nemployed to solve the discretized equations in a segregated form. The numerical algorithm\n\nwas implemented in FORTRAN 90 and can be summarized as:\n\n1. First, an inlet velocity is estimated to solve the Laplace equation for the tempera-\n\nture. From the solution for T , the outlet velocity is calculated using the boundary\n\ncondition of Eq. 2.54.\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 51\n\n2. Next, the pressure equation is solved using the outlet velocity calculated in step\n\n(1). Then, the velocities are calculated and the values are compared to the ones\n\nobtained in step (1);\n\n3. Return to step (1) until the converged solution is obtained.\n\nConvergence of the solution was examined by checking the overall mass and energy\n\nbalances. The coupled equations are assumed to converge when overall energy and mass\n\nbalances are satisfied within \u00b1 1%. The code verification was developed according to the\nmethod reported by Ec?a &amp; Hoekstra (2008), and it was found that a grid of (150 \u00d7 150)\nis sufficient to obtain accurate solutions. The uncertainty of the numerical solution was\n\nestimated using the method developed by Marchi &amp; Silva (2002). The same grid of\n\n(150\u00d7150) was chosen and the numerical uncertainty of the solutions for the temperature\nand pressure fields were \u00b10.038 oC and \u00b15.443 Pa, respectively. Further information\nregarding the code verification and the determination of the numerical uncertainty of the\n\nsolution can be found in Appendix B.\n\n2.2.3 Results and Discussion\n\nThe results are presented as follows. First, the problem was solved for a porous wick\n\nwith only one layer and the results are presented for a specific inlet heat flux. Then,\n\nthree analyses are developed: analysis of the effect of the magnitude of the external heat\n\ntransfer rate in the mass flow rate, analysis of the onset of drying (one-layer) and analysis\n\nof the effect of a bi-layered structure on the mass flow rate and onset of drying. For the\n\nresults presented here, water was used as working fluid. A ceramic wick, initially with\n\none layer and next with two layers with different thermal properties, was used as porous\n\nwick. The thermodynamic properties of the wick and the working fluid and the main\n\nnondimensional parameters are presented in Table 2.3. In the analysis that follows, the\n\nproperties were kept constant.\n\nTable 2.3 \u2013 Thermophysical properties of the porous wick and working fluid and nondi-\nmensional parameters.\n\n?

This heat flux applied is representative of typical values found\n\nin aeroespacial applications and in cooling electronics components of portable computers.\n\nThe dimensions of the wick are: R = 15 mm, R\n?\n\n= 7.5 mm, Lz,1 = 4 mm, Lz,2 = 6 mm.\n\nThe saturation temperature is Tsat = 40\noC at the vapor outlet and the pressure at liquid\n\ninlet is Pl,in = 4246 Pa (Tl,in = 30\noC). The streamlines point upwards up to the middle\n\nof the structure, where they begin to change direction towards the outlet surface of the\n\nwick. Note that the liquid pressure is not uniform at the outlet surface, but becomes\n\na consequence of the normal heat flux at this surface. There is a strong curvature of\n\nthe streamlines at the end of the fin at r = R\n?\n. Figure 2.12(b) presents the inlet and\n\noutlet normal velocities. Note the high velocity of the vapor flow at the end of the fin (at\n\nr = R\n?\n). Actually, at r = R\n\n?\n, vz,out ? ?. This result of the velocity at r = R\n\n?\ndoes not\n\nmatch with the expected physics of the problem. Indeed, there is a no-slip condition at\n\nthe wall of the fin and would be necessary to include in the momentum equation (Darcy\u2019s\n\nLaw) the macroscopic (Brinkman) viscous term for taking into account this phenomenon.\n\nHowever, to some extend, as the velocities are so low, this contribuition would not affect\n\nthe temperature and pressure fields obtained with the model.\n\nFigure 2.13(a) presents the isotherm and heat flux lines for an inlet heat flux of\n\n4.0\u00d7104 W/m2. Note that part of the heat flows to the outlet where evaporation occurs,\nwhile the remaining flows right to the feeding liquid channel. Fig. 2.13(b) presents the\n\ntemperature distribution at outlet and inlet for the same inlet heat flux used for Fig.\n\n2.11(a). The inlet temperature presents a maximum variation of 0.02 oC for all results\n\nobtained. These figures should be compared to Fig. 2.10 for the simplified model. We\n\nnote a markedly different temperature distribution for the region underneath the channel.\n\nFrom this general view, more specific aspects will be presented using the nondimen-\n\nsional variables.\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 53\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2.12 \u2013 (a) Streamlines and isobaric lines within the wick for a heat flux of 4.0\u00d7104\nW/m2; (b) inlet and outlet normal velocities at the outlet of vapor for a heat flux of\n4.0 \u00d7 104 W/m2.\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 54\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2.13 \u2013 (a) Isotherm lines and heat streamlines and (b) temperature profiles at the\ninlet and outlet for a heat flux of 4.0 \u00d7 104 W/m2.\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 55\n\n2.2.4 Effect of the magnitude of the external heat transfer rate in the\nmass flow rate\n\nIt is expected that an increase in the heat flux at the fin causes an increase in the mass\n\nflow rate. Figures 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 present the nondimensional isotherm and heat flux\n\nlines for three increasing heat fluxes. Fig. 2.14 presents the results for a nondimensional\n\ninlet heat flux of 5.0. The fin ends at r? = 0.5. The isotherm with T? = 1.0 (T = Tv) is\n\nalso shown. Note that surface evaporation occurs only in the first few millimeters of the\n\noutlet surface, very close to the end of the fin. For the remaining of the fin, the heat flux\n\nlines turn around and heat flows right to the liquid channel. As the nondimensional heat\n\nflux is increased (Figs. 2.15 and 2.16), an increased amount of heat flows to the outlet\n\nsurface, causing the liquid evaporation. When the heat flux is increased, the isotherm\n\nT? = 1.0 penetrates deeper in the porous wick.\n\nFigure 2.14 \u2013 Nondimensional isotherm and heat flux lines for a nondimensional inlet heat\nflux of 5.0 (qin = 2.0 \u00d7 104 W/m2).\n\nThis is also evidenced in Fig. 2.17 that presents the normal nondimensional liquid\n\nvelocity at the outlet surface. The area underneath the curve shown is proportional to\n\nthe mass flow rate which, given the boudary conditions, is simply calculated by\nqinAin\nhlv\n\n.\n\nSince the normal velocity at the region underneath the fin is zero, Fig. 2.17 shows only\n\nthe vapor outlet surface (z? = 1.0 and 0.5 ? r? ? 1.0). Except for a region closer to the\nfin, the nondimensional liquid velocity at the outlet surface is not very sensitive to the\n\nheat flux.\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 56\n\nFigure 2.15 \u2013 Nondimensional isotherm and heat flux lines for a nondimensional inlet heat\nflux of 10.5 (qin = 4.2 \u00d7 104 W/m2).\n\nFigure 2.16 \u2013 Nondimensional isotherm and heat flux lines for a nondimensional inlet heat\nflux of 37.5 (qin = 1.5 \u00d7 105 W/m2).\n\n2.2.5 Analysis of the Onset of Drying\n\nThe heat transfer rate imposed in the fin is transferred to the outlet surface, causing\n\nevaporation, and also to the inlet surface, resulting in heating of the liquid channel. Both\n\nthese heat transfer paths have their characteristic thermal resistances. As a result of these\n\nthermal resistances, the fin surface reaches a temperature which can be reasonably large\n\nin certain conditions. For instance in Fig. 2.16, we observe that for a nondimensional inlet\n\nheat flux of 37.5, the fin surface reaches nondimensional temperatures above 15 which are\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 57\n\nFigure 2.17 \u2013 Normal nondimensional liquid velocity at the outlet surface as a function\nof nondimensional inlet heat flux.\n\nabout 14 times above the nondimensional saturation temperature of the fluid (for infinite\n\nradius of curvature). Then, a question remains whether the fluid would remain liquid or\n\nevaporate under this temperature. This can be tested by observing the capillary pressure\n\nat the top surface of the wick and comparing it to the maximum capillary pressure that\n\nthe wick can sustain.\n\nThe maximum capillary pressure that a pore with radius rp can sustain is,\n\n?pcap,max =\n2?\n\nrp\n\nThis can be nondimensionalized using Eq. 2.59 resulting in,\n\n?p?cap,max =\n2? (K/?)\n\n1/2\n\n?rp\n=\n\n2 (K/?)\n1/2\n\nrp\n(2.61)\n\nNote that this maximum nondimensional capillary pressure is a purely geometrical\n\nparameter. Therefore, the maximum nondimensional capillary pressure is the one that\n\nexists for a pore with radius equal to 2 (K/?)\n1/2\n\n. When applied to a porous wick, this\n\nmeans that the maximum capillary pressure is the one that occurs when the average\n\nradius of the curvature of all menisci exposed to the vapor phase is equal to rp.\n\nThe local nondimensional capillary pressure at the outlet surface is given by equation\n\nEq. 2.59 (repeated here)\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 58\n\n?p?cap =\n(pv ?pl) (K/?)\n\n1/2\n\n?\n\nwhere pv = psat(Tv) and pl is the local value of liquid pressure calculated from the improved\n\nmodel, pl = pl(r) at z = Lz. Here, ? = ?(T) where T is the porous wick temperature.\n\nUsing pv = psat(Tv) and pl obtained from the solution of the improved model, pl = pl(r)\n\nat z = Lz, ?p\n?\ncap can be calculated and compared to ?p\n\n?\ncap,max.\n\nFig. 2.18 presents the nondimensional capillary pressure at the top surface as a\n\nfunction of properties for two heat fluxes, q?in = 10.5 and q\n?\nin = 5.0. All properties were\n\nkept constant and correspond to the properties of the porous wick with nondimensional\n\naverage pore radius of 11.34. The horizontal lines represent the maximum nondimensional\n\ncapillary pressure for each characteristic nondimensional pore size, from 11.34 to 56.69 as\n\nshown. We note that for the nondimensional inlet heat flux of 5.0 all media would remain\n\nsaturated by liquid except those with the larger nondimensional pores of 37.80 and 56.69.\n\nFor these two sizes, the local capillary pressure exceeds the maximum allowed capillary\n\npressure and, therefore, the region underneath the fin would dry and the evaporation front\n\nwould seek a new equilibrium position within the wick. This condition in which the front\n\nis embedded within the wick has been analyzed by Demidov &amp; Yatsenko (1994), Figus et\n\nal. (1999), Takahashi (2002) and Kaya &amp; Goldak (2006).\n\nFigure 2.18 \u2013 Nondimensional capillary pressure profiles at z? = 1.0 for different nondi-\nmensional averaged radius of curvature and nondimensional inlet heat fluxes.\n\nFor higher heat fluxes, all media with pore sizes above 11.34 would suffer dry out\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 59\n\nunderneath the fin. Therefore, there is a relation between the pore size (and all medium\n\nproperties) and the heat flux at the onset of drying. Note that this drying underneath the\n\nfin may not cause the failure by the capillary limit, since there may be a stable condition\n\nfor operation with the embedded evaporation front according to Demidov &amp; Yatsenko\n\n(1994), Figus et al. (1999), Takahashi (2002) and Kaya &amp; Goldak (2006). This, however,\n\nis not analyzed here. Nevertheless, this test allows the definition of safe operation limits.\n\n2.2.6 Analysis of the Onset of Drying in the Bi-layered Structure\n\nHere, the analysis of the porous wick with two layers is presented. It is expected that\n\nthis kind of porous structure improves the capillary pumping capacity, avoiding reaching\n\nthe capillary limit. It is also expected that the heat transfer to the feeding liquid channel\n\nis decreased. For the bi-layered porous wick, porous wick 1 and 2 have nondimensional\n\nlengths of L?z,1 = 0.4 and L\n?\nz,2 = 0.6, respectively. The porous wick 2 has the effective\n\nthermal conductivity constant (?e,2 = 4.0 W/m ? K). The effective thermal conductivity\nof the porous wick 1 was varied (?e,1) from 6.0 W/m-K (two-layers I) to 8.0 W/m-K\n\n(two-layers II) in order to evaluate its effect on the onset of drying.\n\nFigure 2.19 presents the nondimesnional capillary pressure at the top surface as a\n\nfunction of properties of the wicks with one and two layers for a nondimensional inlet\n\nheat flux of 10.5 and four characteristic nondimensional pore average radius (from 11.34\n\nto 56.69). All properties were also kept constant and correspond to the nondimensional\n\naverage porous radius of 11.34. Note that for the nondimensional inlet heat flux of 10.5 in\n\nthe wick with two layers, as the thermal conductivity increase the local capillary pressure\n\ndecreases and may not exceed the maximum allowed capillary pressure.\n\nFor a given nondimensional heat flux there will be a local maximum nondimensional\n\naverage radius needed to avoid the drying of the wick in the region underneath the fin,\n\nwhich will be called critical nondimensional average radius (r?p,crit). From Eq. 2.59 and\n\n2.60, this is given by,\n\nr?p,crit =\n2?\n\n(pv ?pl) (K/?)\n1/2\n\n(2.62)\n\nwhere pv = psat(Tv) and pl is the local value of liquid pressure calculated from the improved\n\nmodel, pl = pl(r) at z = Lz. Here, ? = ?(T) where T is the porous wick temperature.\n\nFigures 2.20 and 2.21 depict curves of critical nondimensional average radius as a\n\nfunction of the nondimensional heat flux in the upper part of the wick (z? = 1). Figure\n\n2.20 presents the nondimensional critical average radius for two nondimensional heat\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 60\n\nFigure 2.19 \u2013 Nondimensional capillary pressure profiles at z? = 1.0 in the bi-layered wick\nfor a nondimensional inlet heat flux of 10.5 and for different nondimensional averaged\nradius of curvature.\n\nfluxes (5.0 and 10.5) for the porous wick with one layer.\n\nFigure 2.20 \u2013 Critical nondimensional average radius profiles at z? = 1.0 for two nondi-\nmensional inlet heat fluxes, one layer.\n\nThis is the same condition presented in Figs. 2.14 and 2.15. Note that, in the region\n\nunderneath of the fin, the smaller the nondimensional heat flux the higher the critical\n\nnondimensional average radius. That is, the temperatures underneath the fin and the mass\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 61\n\nflow rate decrease with the decreasing of heat flux. As a consequence the capillary pressure\n\nalso decreases. Since the critical average radius is inversely proportional to the maximum\n\ncapillary pressure according Eq. 2.62, when the nondimensional heat flux is decreased the\n\ncritical nondimensional average radius increases. For the nondimensional heat flux of 10.5\n\nthe porous wick should be manufactured with minimum critical nondimensional average\n\nradius of 10.86 (rp = 2.87 \u00b5m calculated for the properties from Table 2.3), while for\n\nnondimensional heat flux of 5.0 it is sufficient a minimum critical nondimensional average\n\nradius of 32.18 (rp = 8.51 \u00b5m calculated for the properties from Table 2.3).\n\nIt is noted in Fig. 2.21 that for the same nondimensional heat flux of 10.2, as the ther-\n\nmal conductivity of the wick 1 increases, the minimum critical nondimensional average\n\nradius also increases in the region underneath the fin. The minimum critical nondimen-\n\nsional average radius is 32.18 (two-layers II - ?e,1 = 8.0 W/m ? K), 21.86 (two-layers I -\n?e,1 = 6.0 W/m ? K) and 10.86 (one-layer). Therefore, these results provide guidelines\nfor the design and manufacture of the porous wicks in order to avoid the drying of the\n\nregion underneath the fin.\n\nFigure 2.21 \u2013 Critical nondimensional average radius profiles at z? = 1.0 in the bi-layered\nwick for a nondimensional inlet heat flux of 10.5.\n\nIt is noticed in Figs. 2.20 and 2.21 that the minimum critical nondimensional average\n\nradius is located in the region underneath of the fin at z? = 1.0 and r? = 0.0. Thus,\n\nthe Fig. 2.22 presents the critical nondimensional average radius as a function of the\n\nnondimensional heat flux at z? = 1.0 and r? = 0.0.\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 62\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2.22 \u2013 (a) Critical nondimensional average radius at z? = 1.0 and r? = 0.0 as a\nfunction of the nondimensional inlet heat flux for one layer and (b) bi-layered wick.\n\nThe curve shown in Fig. 2.22(a) represents the capillary limit, i.e., bellow this curve\n\nthe capillary limit is not reached and there is no vapor breakthrough and above the curve\n\noccurs the vapor invasion of the porous wick. Figure 2.22(b) presents the minimum critical\n\nnondimensional average radius as a function of the nondimensional heat flux for a bi-\n\nlayered wick. Note that, as the thermal conductivity of the wick 1 increases, the capillary\n\nlimit is displaced and the minimum critical nondimensional average radius also increases.\n\nFor a minimum critical nondimensional average radius (r?p,crit) of 20, for instance, the\n\nnondimensional heat flux increases from 7.5 (one layer) to 15 (bi-layered) which refer to\n\n\n\n2 Theoretical Analisys 63\n\na heat flux of 3 \u00d7 104 W/m2 and 6 \u00d7 104 W/m2, respectively.\n\n2.2.7 Conclusions\n\nThe model developed here allowed to verify the effect of design variables in the steady-\n\nstate performance of a flat capillary evaporator. The model simulated the heat and mass\n\ntransfer within a wick with one and two layers with different thermophysical properties.\n\nAlso, a criterion for the onset of dryout was obtained and calculated for the conditions\n\nsimulated.\n\nThe analysis of the wick with one and two layers showed that the wick with two\n\nlayers is better than with one layer regarding the onset of drying underneath the fin.\n\nOther conclusions are:\n\n1. The capillary limit, or onset drying, stablishes a relation between the pore size (and\n\nall medium properties) and the heat flux. If this limit is reached, the evaporation\n\nfront may penetrate within the wick. This can be used as a criterium for the\n\nspecification of the maximum heat flux allowed during operation in steady-state.\n\n2. The larger the thermal conductivity of the porous wick 1 (underneath the fin), the\n\nsmaller is the heat transfer to the feeding channel, causing a smaller increase of the\n\ninlet temperature. The increase of the thermal conductivity of the porous wick 1\n\ncauses the increase of the capillary limit, avoiding the onset of drying of the region\n\nunderneath the fin. The increase of the thermal conductivity also decreases the\n\nmass flow rate, causing the decrease of the pressure losses through the porous wick.\n\n3. Finally, the dimensions of the bi-layered wick (R = 15 mm, R\n?\n\n= 7.5 mm, Lz,1 = 4\n\nmm, Lz,2 = 6 mm) and its thermophysical properties can be used for a design of a\n\nflat capillary evaporator.\n\nFrom the understanding developed from the theoretical analysis, two LHPs and one\n\nCPL were designed, fabricated and tested under conditions typical of aerospacial appli-\n\ncations.\n\nHowever, the attempts to produce a flat capillary evaporator where not succesful due\n\nto sealing difficulties in the region between the wick and the casing. Therefore, it was\n\ndecided to follow the work producing cylindrical capillary evaporators. Besides the change\n\nin geometries, the same general principles described above apply.\n\n\n\n64\n\n3 Experiment\n\n3.1 Introduction\n\nIn this work two LHPs and one CPL were manufactured and tested in order to evaluate\n\ntheir thermal performance and their applicability in thermal control of microprocessors\n\nand electronic components in general. The surface temperatures at the main part of the\n\nsystems, e.g. evaporator and condenser inlet and outlet, compensation chamber (in case\n\nof LHPs) and reservoir (in case of CPL) were measured while the thermal load was varied.\n\nThe LHPs used acetone and water as working fluid, while the CPL only used water. The\n\nLHPs and the CPL used a ceramic porous wick as capillary structure in the evaporator.\n\nFor the heating of the capillary evaporator of LHPs and CPL, electric resistors (cartridge\n\nheaters inside of copper block for the LHPs and heaters in format of wire for the CPL) were\n\nused to simulate the heat generation in microprocessors and electronic components. The\n\ncondensers of the LHPs were cooled using water in forced convection and the condenser\n\nof CPL was cooled using air also in forced convection.\n\nThe CPL and LHPs used here were manufactured at Federal University of Santa\n\nCatarina (UFSC) in Brazil. All tests of the CPL were carried out at Laboratory of\n\nCombustion and Thermal Systems Engineering (LABCET) of UFSC in Brazil and all\n\ntests of LHPs were carried out at Institute of Nuclear Technology and Energy Systems\n\n(IKE) at University of Stuttgart in Germany, under the supervision of Researcher Dr.\n\nRainer Mertz.\n\n3.2 Ceramic Porous Wick Manufacturing\n\nMost porous structures used in the evaporators of LHPs and CPLs are made of metallic\n\nsintered powders, such as nickel, titanium and stainless steel. Metallic wicks have lower\n\nthermal resistance when compared to polymeric and ceramic porous wicks. Although\n\nthis comes as an advantage for heat transfer to the evaporation front, they also transfer a\n\nconsiderable quantity of heat from the evaporation zone to the inlet liquid channel, leading\n\n\n\n3 Experiment 65\n\nto formation of bubbles that block the liquid feeding channel. Moreover, the machining\n\nof porous metal structures can block the external pores and hence reduce the liquid flow.\n\nIn this work, ceramic porous wicks are proposed as alternative to wicks made of metallic\n\nmaterial for all capillary evaporators in order to minimize the bubble formation inside the\n\nliquid feed channel and problems in the machining of the wick. According to Janssen et\n\nal. (2008) ceramic wick structure can be machined by conventional machining processes\n\nand the porosity remains opened up to surface.\n\nHere, slip casting was used to produce the porous structures. The following materials\n\nwere used in the formulation of the ceramic powder: mullite (Treibacher 140F, Brazil)\n\nand alumina (Alcoa SG1000, 90% &lt;44\u00b5m, Brazil). Activated carbon (Carbomafra,\n\n90% &lt;44\u00b5m, Brazil) was used as pore forming agent to increase the porosity of the\n\nporous elements. Aqueous slurries (67wt% solids content, corresponding to 80wt% mullite\n\nand 20wt% of alumina) were prepared. The pore forming agent was then added (10wt%\n\nin relation to the solids content). Chemical additives (sodium polyacrylate as dispersant,\n\nand poly(vinyl-alcohol) as plasticizer) were used to stabilize the slurries. The slurries\n\nwere then submitted to a grinding process to decrease particle size and after grinding, the\n\nslurries were poured into plaster moulds. Subsequently, the samples were pre-sintered at\n\n1200oC for 1 h to remove the pore forming agent, followed by sintering at 1450oC for 1 h,\n\n(BERTI et al., 2010).\n\nFigure 3.1 shows the ceramic wick with vapor channels (grooves) used in the evapo-\n\nrators of LHPs and CPL. Only four grooves were machined in the ceramic wick used for\n\nthe LHPs, Fig. 3.1(a). Along the work the machining technique was improved and it was\n\npossible to machine more vapor channels (12 grooves) in the ceramic wick used for the\n\nCPL, Fig. 3.1(b). A thermal cleaning at 800oC for 120 min is applied to remove the oil\n\ncontamination after the machining.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 3.1 \u2013 (a) Ceramic wick with vapor channels (grooves) used in the LHPs and (b) in\nthe CPL.\n\n\n\n3 Experiment 66\n\n3.3 Manufacturing of the LHPs and the CPL\n\nDuring the assembly of the capillary evaporator, the insertion of porous wicks into\n\nthe metallic envelope must result in close contact tolerances between envelope walls and\n\nwick surface. This contact should be tight in order to avoid any vapor leak back to the\n\nliquid channel. The assembling of metallic wicks requires at the same time the heating of\n\nthe metallic tube and cooling of the wick for the insertion into the metallic envelop. The\n\nceramic wick is not cooled due to its low volumetric thermal expansion coefficient when\n\ncompared to those of metals. Therefore, only the metallic envelop of the evaporator is\n\nheated at ? 800oC for the insertion of the ceramic wick.\n\nFigure 3.2(a) depicts a view of the evaporator, the compensation chamber and the\n\nceramic porous wick of the LHPs. Only the upper side of the capillary evaporator has\n\ngrooves. Figure 3.2(b) shows a view of the evaporator and the ceramic porous wick of the\n\nCPL. Contrary to the wicks for LHPs, all the circumference of capillary evaporator for\n\nthe CPL has grooves.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3.2 \u2013 (a) View of the evaporator, the compensation chamber and the ceramic\nporous wick of the LHPs and (b) view of the evaporator and the ceramic porous wick of\nthe CPL.\n\n3.4 Description of the LHPs\n\nTwo LHPs were manufactured with the same capillary evaporator. Fig. 3.3 shows the\n\nLHPs. Both capillary evaporators have 10 mm of inner diameter and 25 mm of length.\n\nThe ceramic porous wick has 50% of porosity, 1 to 3 \u00b5m pore size distribution and\n\npermeability of about 1.5 \u00d7 10?14 m2; a compensation chamber with the same diameter\nof the evaporator and length of 50 mm; transport lines of liquid and vapor with 2.8 mm\n\nof inner diameter and the condenser with 120 mm of length. The lengths of the vapor\n\n\n\n3 Experiment 67\n\nand liquid transport lines of the two LHPs have small differences, which are presented in\n\nthe Table 3.1.\n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 \u2013 General view of the LHP (acetone) and LHP (water) with cylindrical evap-\norators.\n\nThe properties of the ceramic porous wick, obtained in Berti (2008), and the working\n\nfluids are presented in Table 3.2.\n\n3.4.1 Filling Station\n\nThe ammount of working fluid has a significant influence on the operation of capillary\n\npumping systems, hence it is necessary to control carefully the amount of fluid inserted\n\nin these systems. Figure 3.4 shows the filling station used in the filling of LHPs which is\n\ncomposed by one vaccum pump conection, four valves and one burette. First, the valves\n\n1 and 3 are opened while the valves 2 and 4 are closed. Next the conection between the\n\nvaccum pump and the LHP is evacuated. After reaching the required vaccum, the valve\n\n4 is opened in order to evacuate the LHP. After reaching the required vaccum level in the\n\nLHP, the valves 1 and 4 are closed and the valve 2 is opened. Again the valve 4 is opened\n\ncarefully until the desired volume of liquid is fed to the LHP.\n\nThe working fluid charge ratio of LHP working with water was varied in the range\n\nfrom 50 to 65% in steps of 5%, while for the LHP working with acetone the working fluid\n\ncharge ratio was set at 50, 60, 65 and 70%. A working fluid charge ratio of 60% means that\n\nthe LHP is filled with 60% of its total volume including the compensation chamber.

The LHP with the\n\nheat source, the heat sink and the temperature sensors were fixed to a movable frame in\n\norder to adjust the orientation to different angles. The whole construction is embedded\n\ninto a box made of Plexiglas (1.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 m3), where different ambient conditions\n\ncan be set. The box is insulated to avoid as much as possible heat transfer between the\n\nbox and the ambient. Flanges are employed at the front side and at the top of the box,\n\nso that the experimental components inside the box can be set easily to the requested\n\nexperimental conditions. Several feedthroughs are employed to connect the lines for the\n\nmeasurement sensors and the heating and cooling devices.\n\nThe power supply unit is connected to the cartridge heaters and is controlled by\n\nthe data logger. A thermostat controls the temperature of the coolant at the condenser\n\nsection. The volumetric flow rate of the coolant working fluid (water) is measured by a\n\nmagnetic inductive flow meter. Two resistant temperature sensors (Pt100) measure the\n\ninlet and outlet coolant temperature. The temperature inside the box is set by a cryostat.\n\nA resistant temperature sensor (Pt100) located near the LHP is connected to the cryostat,\n\nmeasuring the input temperature for the loop control of the cryostat. Furthermore there\n\nare three more resistant temperature sensors (Pt100) measuring the ambient temperature\n\ninside the box placed near the top, in the middle and at the bottom. All signals are\n\nmeasured by a data logger including the room ambient temperature which is measured\n\nby a resistant temperature sensor (Pt100). Figure 3.6 depicts the external view of the\n\ntest rig.\n\n\n\n3 Experiment 70\n\nFigure 3.5 \u2013 Diagram of the instrumentation of the test rig.\n\nFigure 3.6 \u2013 Photo of the test rig with movable frame without front door.\n\nThe temperature distribution along the LHP was measured using thermal resistors\n\n(Pt100). Figure 3.7 depicts the locations of the temperature sensors: evaporator out-\n\nlet (TEvap,out), condenser inlet (TCond,in), condenser outlet (TCond,out), evaporator inlet\n\n(TEvap,in) and the compensation chamber (TCC).\n\n\n\n3 Experiment 71\n\nFigure 3.7 \u2013 Positions of the thermal sensors along the LHP.\n\n3.4.3 Cooling and Heating Systems\n\nThe capillary evaporators of the LHPs were heated using two cartridge heaters inserted\n\ninto a copper block. The heat sink of the LHPs, which used water as working fluid, were\n\ncooled by a thermostat. Figure 3.8 presents the LHP with the condenser box attached to\n\nit, the copper block and the cartridge heaters attached to the capillary evaporator of one\n\nof the LHPs.\n\nFigure 3.8 \u2013 View of one of the LHPs, showing the heating system and the condenser box.\n\n3.4.4 Experimental Procedure\n\nThe LHPs were first adjusted to inclinations of interest and the box ambient tem-\n\nperature was set. Once all temperatures of the LHP showed the same value as the box\n\nambient temperature (?Tmax = 1\noC), the first power input step of 5 W was applied to the\n\nevaporator. Once all temperatures reached a stationary value (or oscillating stationary\n\nvalue), the power input was increased by steps of 5 W. The electrical power (Pel) applied\n\n\n\n3 Experiment 72\n\nto the cartridge was calculated by measuring the current and the voltage accross it. As-\n\nsuming no heat losses through the insulation at the heating zone, the applied electrical\n\npower is taken as the heat applied to the LHP. The performance tests were carried out\n\nfor power inputs ranging from 5 to 25 W for the LHP (Acetone) and ranging from 5 to\n\n15 W for the LHP (Water), taking into account the changes in the heat sink temperature\n\nand different slopes for the LHPs.\n\n3.4.5 Analysis of Experimental Uncertainties\n\nFor LHP, including the accuracy of the temperature sensors and the uncertainties\n\nof the data logger, the uncertainty of the temperature is estimated at \u00b10.41 oC. The\nuncertainty of the electrical power input is estimated at \u00b10.12 W including the uncertainty\nof the power supply unit and the uncertainty of the data logger. Further information\n\nconcerning the estimative of the experimental uncertainty can be found in Appendix C.\n\n3.5 Description of the CPL\n\nOne CPL was manufactured, Fig. 3.9, with the following characteristics: capillary\n\nevaporator has 10 mm of inner diameter and 50 mm of length; the same ceramic porous\n\nwick used for the LHPs were used; transport lines of liquid and vapor have 2.8 mm of inner\n\ndiameter and the condenser has 385 mm of length. The main structural characteristics of\n\nthe CPL are presented in Table 3.3.\n\nFigure 3.9 \u2013 General view of the CPL (water) with cylindrical evaporator, reservoir and\npressure sensor.\n\n3.5.1 Filling Station\n\nA similar filling process as for LHP is used for the filling of the CPL using another\n\nfilling station that is shown in Fig. 3.10.\n\n\n\n3 Experiment 73\n\nTable 3.3 \u2013 Structural characteristics of the CPL.\nCharacteristic CPL (Water)\nEvaporator - devap,in, (mm) 10\nEvaporator - devap,out, (mm) 12\nNumber of grooves - Ngroove, 12\nGroove heigth - hgroove, (mm) 1\nGroove width - wgroove, (mm) 1\nGroove length- Lgroove, (mm) 25\nActive zone length, (mm) 30\nWick - rwick,in, (mm) 2.5\nWick - rwick,out, (mm) 4.0\nWick length - Lwick, (mm) 30\nVapor transport line, (mm) 205\nVapor transport line - dvl,in, (mm) 2.8\nLiquid transport line, (mm) 140\nLiquid transport line - dll,in, (mm) 2.8\nCondenser type Finning Tube\nNumber of fins - Nfin, 24\nFin width - ?fin, (mm) 1.0\nFin channel - ?b, (mm) 2.0\nFin heigth - Lfin, (mm) 20\nFin base heigth - Lb, (mm) 10\nFin length - Wfin, (mm) 67\nFin base length - Wb, (mm) 77\nCondenser length, (mm) 385\nCondenser - dcond,in, (mm) 2.8\nCondenser - dcond,out, (mm) 5.0\nReservoir length, (mm) 90\n\nFigure 3.10 \u2013 Filling station for the CPL.\n\nFor the CPL the total volume does not take into account the reservoir volume, there-\n\nfore the working fluid charge ratio was tested with 120 and 130%. A working fluid charge\n\nratio of 100% means that only the loop is filled and the reservoir is empty.\n\n\n\n3 Experiment 74\n\n3.5.2 Experimental Apparatus\n\nThe temperature distribution along the CPL was measured using temperature sen-\n\nsors (thermocouples type T). Figure 3.11 depicts the locations of the temperature sen-\n\nsors: evaporator (TEvap), evaporator outlet (TEvap,out), vapor line (TV aporLine), condenser\n\ninlet (TCond,in), condenser (TCond), condenser outlet (TCond,out), evaporator inlet (TEvap,in),\n\nreservoir (TRes) and reservoir outlet (TRes,out).\n\nFigure 3.11 \u2013 Positions of the thermal sensors along the CPL.\n\n3.5.3 Cooling and Heating Systems\n\nFigure 3.12 presents the CPL with the air cooling system at the condenser section,\n\nthe heating system of the capillary evaporator and reservoir and the pressure sensor. Two\n\nair coolers with fins were used to cool the condenser section as shown in Fig. 3.12(a).\n\n3.5.4 Experimental Procedure\n\nThe CPL was adjusted to the orientation of interest (horizontal position) and the\n\nroom temperature was measured. Once all temperatures of the CPL showed almost the\n\nsame value as the ambient temperature (?Tmax = 1\no C), the first power input step of 5\n\nW was applied to the evaporator. Once all temperatures reached a stationary value (or\n\noscillating stationary value), the power input was increased by steps of 5 W. The electrical\n\npower (Pel) applied to the electric heater was calculated by measuring the voltage and\n\nthe current which pass through the wire. Assuming no heat losses through the insulation\n\nat the heating zone, the applied electrical power is taken as the thermal heat applied to\n\n\n\n3 Experiment 75\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 3.12 \u2013 (a) Top view of the CPL, the heater system and the condenser and (b) side\nview of the CPL, the coolers fans, the fins of the condenser and the pressure sensor.\n\nthe CPL. The performance tests of the CPL were carried out for power inputs ranging\n\nfrom 5 to 30 W.\n\n3.5.5 Analysis of Experimental Uncertainties\n\nFor the CPL, the uncertainty of the measurements were estimated for the temperature,\n\npower input and pressure. Taking into account the accuracy of the temperature sensors\n\n(thermocouples type T) and the uncertainties of the data logger (Agilent 34970A with\n\n20 channels), the uncertainty of the temperature measured was estimated at \u00b11.8 oC.\nThe uncertainty of the electrical power input was estimated at \u00b10.28 W including the\nuncertainty of the power supply unit and the uncertainty of the data logger (Agilent\n\nN6700B). The experimental uncertainty of pressure sensor was estimated as \u00b1345.22 Pa.\nFurther information regarding the estimation of the experimental uncertainties can also\n\nbe found in Appendix C.\n\n\n\n76\n\n4 Experimental Results and\nAnalysis\n\nThis chapter presents the results of the thermal behaviour of two LHPs and one CPL.\n\nPerformance tests of two LHPs using acetone and water as working fluids were carried\n\nout for power inputs up to 25 W and performance tests of one CPL using water were\n\ncarried out for power inputs up to 30 W. An analisys of the results is developed regarding\n\nthe startup and operation of the systems for different working fluid inventory, heat sink\n\ntemperature and inclination. Besides, an analisys of the capillary limit for all systems and\n\na comparison between the experimental and theoretical (modeling presented in Chapter\n\n2) results are also presented.\n\n4.1 Results of LHP with Acetone\n\n4.1.1 The Working Fluid Inventory and Startup\n\nA successful startup is mainly related to the applied heat load, heat sink temperature\n\nand working fluid inventory. Figure 4.1 shows the start up for 50, 60, 65 and 70% working\n\nfluid charge ratios, under heat load of 10 W and condenser positioned 90o above the\n\nevaporator. This position is more favorable to the operation of the LHP because the\n\nliquid flows to the evaporator due to the capillary and also to the gravity action. Besides,\n\nit can be sure that the evaporator is full filled with liquid before start-up.\n\nIn Fig. 4.1(a), after approximately 60 s, the inlet condenser temperature (Tcond,in)\n\nincreases fast, indicating that the vapor front reached the condenser. At 130 s, however,\n\nthe temperature starts to decrease, indicating that the system failed to start up. This\n\nsudden decrease is caused by lack of working fluid along the loop. So, there is not enough\n\nliquid flow to the capillary evaporator. As a consequence of no evaporation of liquid, the\n\noutlet temperature of evaporator increases continuously. A similar behavior is presented\n\nin Fig. 4.1(b), where the system failed at approximately 275 s.\n\nA successful startup occurred for 65% working fluid charge ratio, shown in Fig. 4.1(c).\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 77\n\n(a) 50% (b) 60%\n\n(c) 65% (d) 70%\n\nFigure 4.1 \u2013 Startup under heat load of 10 W and condenser positioned 90\u00b0 above the\nevaporator for different working fluid charge ratios.\n\nThe outlet evaporator and the inlet condenser temperatures reached a steady state con-\n\ndition at 68 and 56 oC, respectively. A faster start up was achieved for 70% working fluid\n\ncharge ratio. Now the outlet evaporator and the inlet condenser temperatures reached\n\nthe steady state condition at 52 and 47 oC, respectively. Note that there is a temperature\n\ndifference in the operation temperature (Tevap,out) of 16\noC between the cases (c) and (d).\n\nSo, the fluid inventory plays also an important role regarding the operating temperature\n\nof the LHP. The startup was not successful for working fluid charge ratio smaller than 60%\n\nand there was no significant decrease of operation temperature for working fluid charge\n\nratios higher than 70%.\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 78\n\n4.1.2 Temperatures of LHP (acetone) as a Function of Heat Load\n\nFigure 4.2 depicts the temperatures of the evaporator outlet (Tevap,out), condenser inlet\n\n(Tcond,in), condenser outlet (Tcond,out), evaporator inlet (Tevap,in) and the compensation\n\nchamber (TCC) at horizontal position and heat sink temperature of 20\noC for stepwise\n\nincrease in heat flux.\n\nFigure 4.2 \u2013 Temperatures of LHP (acetone) for heat loads increasing at horizontal posi-\ntion and at heat sink temperature of 20 oC.\n\nThe LHP (acetone) worked satisfactorily in the power range from 5 to 25 W. The\n\nlimit temperature of 100 oC (assumed for safety reasons) was reached for 25 W power in-\n\nput. Contrarily to capillary pumped loops, the temperature of the compensation chamber\n\n(TCC) is not constant, as shown in Fig. 4.2, changing from 29 to 51\noC. The measured out-\n\nlet evaporator temperature was higher, from 50 to 98 oC, and the temperature difference\n\nto the heat sink temperature (20 oC) varied from 30 to 78 oC.\n\n4.1.3 Heat Sink Temperature\n\nFor low heat loads the evaporator temperature is high. As the heat load increases, the\n\nevaporator temperature decreases until a minimum value is reached. This region is called\n\nthe variable conductance mode. Afterwards it starts to increase linearly, characterizing\n\nthe fixed conductance mode. Experimental studies exploring this phenomenon have been\n\nreported in Chen et al. (2006), Ku (1999) and Chuang (2003). Their results showed that\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 79\n\nthe heat sink temperature influences the operation temperature of LHP only when it is\n\nmuch lower than the ambient temperature.\n\nFigure 4.3 presents the outlet evaporator temperatures for 10 and 20 W for the LHP\n\nin horizontal position, using acetone as working fluid and heat sink temperatures varying\n\nfrom 10 to 40 oC. With exception the value for heat load of 10 W under heat sink\n\ntemperature of 10 oC, there is a small difference, mostly within the uncertainty level,\n\nbetween the outlet evaporator temperatures when the heat sink temperature changes for\n\nboth heat loads. Since the heat sink temperature is approximately equal to the ambient\n\ntemperature, it was not possible to state anything concerning the conductance mode.\n\nFigure 4.3 \u2013 Outlet evaporator temperatures of the LHP (acetone) for heat loads of 10\nand 20 W at horizontal position and at heat sink temperatures of 10, 20, 30 and 40 oC.\n\n4.1.4 Inclination of the LHP\n\nFour different scenarios were analyzed: (i) evaporator positioned 90o above the con-\n\ndenser; (ii) condenser positioned 90o above the evaporator, according to Fig. 4.4; (iii)\n\nevaporator positioned 10o above the condenser; (iv) condenser positioned 10o above the\n\nevaporator.\n\nFigure 4.5 depicts the outlet evaporator temperature of LHP (acetone) for heat loads\n\nranging from 10 to 20 W. As expected, due to the position effect of thermobuoyancy on the\n\nmass flow rate, the lowest outlet evaporator temperature was measured for the condenser\n\npositioned 90o above the evaporator. On the other hand, the highest temperature was\n\nmeasured for the evaporator positioned 90o above the condenser.\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 80\n\nFigure 4.4 \u2013 (i) evaporator positioned 90o above the condenser and (ii) condenser posi-\ntioned 90o above the evaporator.\n\nFigure 4.5 \u2013 Outlet evaporator temperatures of the LHP (acetone) for heat loads of 10,\n15 and 20 W at different slopes and at heat sink temperature of 20 oC.\n\n4.2 Results of LHP with Water\n\n4.2.1 The Working Fluid Inventory and Startup\n\nFigure 4.6 shows the start up for 50, 55, 60 and 65% working fluid charge ratios, under\n\nheat load of 10W and at horizontal position. The startup was successful for working fluid\n\ncharge ratio of 60%. In Fig. 4.6(a) the temperature of condenser inlet increases but does\n\nnot reach a stationary state and after 800 s the system fails. This elapsed time until\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 81\n\nfailure increases as the working fluid charge ratio increases, as it can seen in Figs. 4.6(a)\n\nand (b). It took 1500 and 2250 s for system failure in case of 55 and 60% working fluid\n\ncharge ratios, respectively. Finally, the successful startup was reached for 65% working\n\nfluid charge ratio, Fig. 4.6(d).\n\n(a) 50% (b) 55%\n\n(c) 60% (d) 65%\n\nFigure 4.6 \u2013 Startup under heat load of 10 W and condenser positioned 90\u00b0 above the\nevaporator for diffrent working fluid charge ratios.\n\n4.2.2 Temperatures of LHP (water) as a Function of Heat Load\n\nFigure 4.7 depicts the loop temperatures, measured in the same positions as in the\n\nLHP with acetone, for the LHP with water at horizontal position and at heat sink tem-\n\nperature of 20 oC. The LHP (water) worked satisfactorily in the range from 5 to 15 W,\n\nas shown in Fig. 4.7. The maximum operation temperature was again set to 100 oC for\n\nsafety reasons. The outlet evaporator temperature reached higher temperatures ranging\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 82\n\nfrom 60 to 100 oC, and the temperature difference to the heat sink temperature (20 oC),\n\nvaried from 40 to 80 oC.\n\nFigure 4.7 \u2013 Temperatures of LHP (water) for heat loads increasing at horizontal position\nand at heat sink temperature of 20 oC.\n\n4.2.3 Heat Sink Temperature\n\nFigure 4.8 presents outlet evaporator temperatures for 5, 10 and 15 W at horizontal\n\nposition, considering water as working fluid and heat sink temperatures varying from 10\n\nto 40 oC. For low heat load (5 W) there is a small difference between the temperatures.\n\nAs the heat load increases, this difference increases and reaches up to 10.3 oC. Again,\n\nsince the heat sink temperature is approximately equal to the ambient temperature, it is\n\nnot possible to state anything concerning the conductance mode.\n\n4.2.4 Inclination of the LHP\n\nFigure 4.9 shows the outlet evaporator temperature of LHP (water) for heat loads\n\nfrom 5 to 15 W. The lowest outlet evaporator temperature was also measured for the\n\ncondenser positioned 90o above the evaporator. The highest temperature was measured\n\nfor evaporator positioned 10o above the condenser and the LHP did not start up for\n\nevaporator positioned 90o above the condenser.\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 83\n\nFigure 4.8 \u2013 Outlet evaporator temperatures of the LHP (water) for heat loads of 5, 10\nand 15 W at horizontal position and at heat sink temperatures of 10, 20, 30 and 40 oC.\n\nFigure 4.9 \u2013 Outlet evaporator temperatures of the LHP (water) for heat loads of 5, 10\nand 15 W at different slopes and at heat sink temperature of 20 oC.\n\n4.3 Comparision between LHP with Water and Ace-\n\ntone\n\nHere, the results of two LHPs using water and acetone are compared. The Tab. 4.3\n\npresents the time for the startup corresponding to the results shown in Figs. 4.1 and 4.6.\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 84\n\nIt is noticed that the time for startup for the LHP using acetone was lower than the LHP\n\nusing water. To some extent, this difference between the time for the startup can be due\n\nto several factor such as thermal properties and purity of the working fluid, filling and\n\nmanufactoring of the LHPs and so on.\n\nTable 4.1 \u2013 Startup times for the LHPs.\n\nAcetone Water\n\nR?

R is the working fluid charge ratio.\n?? t is the startup time.\n\nFigure 4.10 presents the temperatures of the evaporator outlet of the LHPs using\n\nacetone and water as a function of the heat load in horizontal position. It was observed a\n\ndifference between the operation temperatures in the experiments using water and acetone\n\nvaring from 13 oC at the lowest load to 33 oC at the highest load. To some extent, this\n\ndifference can be due to the vapor pressure and/or the thermal inertia (startup time). The\n\nvapor pressure of acetone is lower than the water and, as a consquence, the evaporation\n\ntemperature should be lower. The time of startup for the LHP with acetone is lower\n\nthan with water, so the LHP with water takes more time to reach the stabilization of its\n\noperation temperature, causing an increase in temperatures of the system.\n\nA small temperature difference between the evaporator outlet and the heat sink is\n\nrequired for a successful application of these LHPs. Therefore, high temperature differ-\n\nences claim for changes in the properties of the ceramic porous wick (porosity, pore size\n\nand thermal conductivity) or improvements in the original LHP design. A total thermal\n\nresistance, following Maydanik &amp; Vershinin (2009), can be defined as,\n\nRtotal =\n(TEvap ?THS)\n\nQ?evap\n, (4.1)\n\nwhere THS is the heat sink temperature, i.e., the average cooling temperature. Here\n\nTEvap,out was used instead of TEvap, since it was not possible in the set up developed to\n\nfix a thermoresistor at the interface between the copper block heater and the evaporator.\n\nThis resistance plays the role of a relative measure of the LHP effectiveness. When\n\nthe same system operates with two different fluids, the conditions that lead to minimum\n\nresistance imply a higher heat transfer capacity per degree of temperature difference.\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 85\n\nFigure 4.10 \u2013 Outlet evaporator temperatures of the LHPs with acetone and water for\nheat loads of 5, 10 and 15 W at horizontal position and at heat sink temperature of 20\noC.\n\nFigure 4.11 depicts the total thermal resistance for the LHPs for both water and acetone.\n\nIt is noticed that the total thermal resistance for the LHP using water is higher than with\n\nacetone. This difference is due to the higher temperatures in the evaporator outlet, as it\n\nwas explained before. For the measurements made, from 5 to 25 W, the total thermal\n\nresistance was maximum for a heat load of 5 W (8.2 oC/W for LHP using water and 5.7\n\noC/W for LHP using acetone) and it was minimum for a heat load of 20 W (2.9 oC/W\n\nfor LHP using acetone). The operation with water leaded to a minimum total thermal\n\nresistance of 5.3 oC/W for a heat load of 15 W. The smaller the total thermal resistance,\n\nthe greater the heat transfer between the hot (evaporator surface) and cold (heat sink)\n\nsources of the LHP for a given temperature difference.\n\n4.4 Results of CPL with Water\n\n4.4.1 The Working Fluid Inventory and Startup\n\nThe set point temperature of the reservoir controls the CPL operating temperature\n\nregardless of changes in the heat load or heat sink temperature as long as the reservoir\n\nis in a two phase condition. For that, the amount of working fluid in the loop should be\n\nsufficient so that at minimum heat load and minimum sink temperature, the condenser\n\nis almost completely blocked by liquid. If the system does not contain enough liquid, the\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 86\n\nFigure 4.11 \u2013 Total thermal resistance vs. heat load for both LHPs.\n\nreservoir empties before the condenser is completely blocked by liquid.\n\nOn the other hand, if the system contains too much liquid and the reservoir cannot\n\naccommodate the full range of liquid change in the condenser, the CPL will work in the\n\nfixed conductance mode and the temperature will not be controlled, (KU, 1994). As a\n\nresult, the amount of working fluid in the loop is a very important parameter for the proper\n\noperation of CPLs. Most of the time, however, it is not trivial to find the ideal working\n\nfluid charge ratio. Here, besides varying the working fluid charge ratio, it was also required\n\nto change the set point temperature of the reservoir for the proper start up of the CPL.\n\nFigure 4.12 shows the start up for three set point temperatures of the reservoir (40, 50\n\nand 60 oC), for 120% working fluid charge ratio, heat load of 10W and CPL positioned\n\nat horizontal position. The startup was not successful for set point temperatures of the\n\nreservoir of 40 and 50 oC.\n\nIn Fig. 4.12(a) it is shown that after approximately 175 s the inlet condenser tem-\n\nperature (Tcond,in) increases fast, indicating that the vapor front reached the condenser.\n\nAt 500 s, however, the evaporator temperature increases continuously, showing that the\n\nsystem failed. A similar thermal behavior is shown in Fig. 4.12(b), where the system\n\nfailed at approximately 1700 s. The successful startup was reached for the set-point tem-\n\nperature of the reservoir of 60 oC after a short excursion of the evaporator temperature,\n\nas shown in Fig. 4.12(c).\n\nThe lower the set point temperature of the reservoir, the lower the saturation tem-\n\nperature of evaporation into the capillary evaporator. Therefore, in order to have startup\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 87\n\n(a) Treservoir = 40 oC (b) Treservoir = 50 oC\n\n(c) Treservoir = 60 oC\n\nFigure 4.12 \u2013 CPL startup under heat load of 10 W, working fluid charge ratio of 120%\nand at horizontal position for diffrent set point temperatures of the reservoir.\n\nat lower reservoir temperature, the working fluid charge ratio was increased to 130% and\n\nthe results are shown in Fig. 4.13 for heat load of 10 W and at horizontal position. Figure\n\n4.13(a) shows that the CPL did not startup successfully for the set point temperature of\n\nthe reservoir of 40 oC. The system failed at approximately 1100 s. The successful startup\n\nwas reached for the set point temperature of the reservoir of 50 and 60 oC, Figs. 4.13(b)\n\nand 4.14. Besides, in the case for the set point temperature of the reservoir of 50 oC, the\n\nCPL only reached the successful startup under heat load equal or smaller than 10 W.\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 88\n\n(a) Treservoir = 40 oC (b) Treservoir = 50 oC\n\nFigure 4.13 \u2013 CPL startup under heat load of 10 W, working fluid charge ratio of 130%\nand at horizontal position for diffrent set point temperatures of the reservoir.\n\n4.4.2 Temperatures of CPL as a Function of Heat Load\n\nFigure 4.14 depicts the temperatures of the evaporator (Tevap), evaporator outlet\n\n(Tevap,out), condenser inlet (Tcond,in), condenser outlet (Tcond,out), evaporator inlet (Tevap,in)\n\nand the reservoir (Treservoir) at horizontal position with air cooling in the condenser. The\n\ncharge ratio was 130% and the set-point temperature of the reservoir was 60 oC. The\n\nCPL had a sucessful startup and reached nearly the steady state for the range of heat\n\nload from 5 to 30 W.\n\nThe temperature of the evaporator outlet for heat loads of 5 and 10 W remained\n\napproximately constant and varied only 1oC. For heat loads higher than 10 W the tem-\n\nperature of the evaporator outlet increased. It can be noticed that the temperatures of\n\nthe evaporator outlet and the condenser inlet are close for heat load up to 10 W. The\n\nincreased difference observed for higher loads is a consequence of axial heat transfer from\n\nthe heating surface of the evaporator to its outlet. The higher temperature at the evapo-\n\nrator inlet is also a consequence of axial heat transfer along the tubbing from evaporator\n\nsurface.\n\nThe CPL (water) worked satisfactorily in the range from 5 to 30 W. The limit tem-\n\nperature of 100 oC (assumed for safety reasons) at evaporator outlet was not reached even\n\nfor 30 W. However, considering the evaporator temperature as a limiting temperature,\n\nthe CPL worked properly up to heat load of 20 W.\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 89\n\nFigure 4.14 \u2013 Temperatures of the CPL (water) for heat loads increasing at horizontal\nposition.\n\n4.5 Comparision of the Results\n\nHere, the results of the LHP and CPL are compared. Table 4.2 presents the time for\n\nthe startup corresponding to the results shown in Figs. 4.6, 4.12 and 4.13 for the LHP and\n\nCPL, both using water, respectively. It is noticed that the times of startup for the CPL\n\nwere lower than for the LHP. To some extent, this difference between the times of startup\n\ncan be due to the differences between the evaporation areas in the capillary evaporator\n\nof both systems. The evaporation area of the CPL (785.4 mm2) is two time greater than\n\nthe area of the LHP (392.7 mm2), and therefore the CPL can pump approximately twice\n\nmore liquid.\n\nFigure 4.15 presents the temperatures of the evaporator outlet of the LHP using water\n\nand acetone, the CPL using water, and the evaporator temperature of CPL using water\n\nas a function of the heat load, at horizontal position for charge ratio of 130%. A large\n\ndifference between the outlet evaporator temperatures (Tevap,out) of the LHPs using water\n\nand acetone, varing from 13 to 33 oC, is observed. The outlet evaporator temperature of\n\nthe LHP and the CPL (both with water) varied from 19 to 44 oC. It is clear from Fig.\n\n4.15 that in the results of the CPL with water, there is a significant difference between\n\nthe temperature of evaporator (Tevap) and its outlet temperature (Tevap,out), varing from\n\n14 to 66 oC. This difference occurs because the temperature sensor of the evaporator\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 90\n\nTable 4.2 \u2013 Startup times for the LHP and CPL operating with water.\n\nLHP CPL\n\nR(a) (%) t(b) (s) R (%) t (s)\n\n50 253 120(c) 96\n55 263 120(d) 200\n60 371 130(c) 114\n65 361 130(d) 160\n\n(a) R is the working fluid charge ratio.\n(b) t is the startup time.\n(c) In this case Tres = 50 oC.\n(d) In this case Tres = 60 oC.\n\n(Tevap) was placed very close to the electric resistor (heating system). The existence\n\nof this temperature difference indicates the presence of a large heat transfer along the\n\nevaporator.\n\nFigure 4.15 \u2013 Outlet evaporator temperature of the LHPs with acetone and water and\nCPL with water, and evaporator temperature of the CPL with water for heat loads from\n5 to 30 W at horizontal position, with 130% load.\n\nIn order to compare the results obtained for the LHPs and CPL, the total resistance\n\nis calculated using Eq. 4.1. For the CPL, the temperature of the evaporator was used\n\ninstead of the outlet temperature of evaporator and the heat sink temperature is an\n\naverage temperature between the inlet and outlet of condenser. Figure 4.16(a) depicts\n\nthe total thermal resistance for the LHPs and CPL. It is noticed that the total thermal\n\nresistances for the CPL, even using the evaporator temperature (Tevap - CPL), are lower\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 91\n\nthan LHP(water). According to the results presented in Fig. 4.16(a), the CPL with water\n\nworked better than both LHPs for low heat load (5 W). The total thermal resistance was\n\nlarger for heat load of 5 W (5.6 oC/W for CPL using water, 8.2 oC/W for LHP using\n\nwater and 5.7 oC/W for LHP using acetone) and it reached the lowest values in the range\n\nmeasured for heat load of 30 W (3.3 oC/W for CPL using water), heat load of 15 W (5.3\n\noC/W for LHP using water) and heat load of 20 W (2.9 oC/W for LHP using acetone).\n\nThe total thermal resistance (Rtotal) has been customary to express the quality of LHPs\n\nand CPLs, however, it is noticed that Rtotal is size dependent, i.e., the Rtotal does not\n\ntake into account the area of evaporator where the heat transfer rate is applied. Thus, a\n\ndifferent figure of merit is proposed here,\n\nR\n??\n\ntotal =\n?T\n\nq\n?? , (4.2)\n\nwhere q\n??\n\nis the heat flux dissipated by the two-phase system and ?T = TEvap ? THS is\nthe temperature difference between the hot surface, where the thermal load is applied,\n\nand the heat sink.\n\nIt is noticed in Fig. 4.16(b) that R\n??\n\ntotal of the CPL (water) is larger than both LHPs.\n\nThe R\n??\n\ntotal was larger for heat flux of 0.53 W/cm\n2 (52.8 oC/W/cm2 for CPL using water)\n\nand heat flux of 1.06 W/cm2 (38.8 oC/W/cm2 for LHP using water and 27.0 oC/W/cm2\n\nfor LHP using acetone) and it reached the lowest values measured for heat flux of 3.18\n\nW/cm2 (31.7 oC/W/cm2 for CPL and 25.0 oC/W/cm2 for LHP, both using water) and\n\nheat flux of 4.24 W/cm2 (13.5 oC/W/cm2 for LHP using acetone). Now, according to the\n\nresults obtained with R\n??\n\ntotal, the LHP (acetone) worked better than the CPL and LHP,\n\nboth using water.\n\nFigures 4.17 and 4.18 present a comparison between the results of the present work\n\nand the results reported in the literature for Rtotal and R\n??\n\ntotal. Figure 4.17 shows the\n\nresults regarding the CPLs and Fig. 4.18 shows the results regarding the LHPs. It is\n\nnoticed in Fig. 4.17(a), regarding the Rtotal, that the CPL (water) worked only better\n\nthan the results reported by Wang et al. (2008) and Camargo (2004) for ceramic wick.\n\nOn the other hand, in Fig. 4.17(b), regarding the R\n??\n\ntotal which takes into account the\n\nheat flux instead of the heat transfer rate, the CPL (water) worked better than all CPLs.\n\nThe result reported by Camargo (2004) for ceramic wick regarding the R\n??\n\ntotal is not shown\n\nbecause its value reached 406.4 oC/W/cm2 and it is out of the scale of the graphic.\n\nIt is noticed in Fig. 4.18(a) and (b), regarding the Rtotal and R\n??\n\ntotal, despite the LHPs\n\ndeveloped here did not work as well as the mini-LHPs, they presented good results. One\n\nreason for this relatively poor result is that the mini-LHPs reported by the other authors\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 92\n\nuse ammonia as working fluid which, due to its thermal properties, is considered the best\n\nworking fluid for capillary pumping systems.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 4.16 \u2013 (a) Total thermal resistance vs. heat load and (b) total thermal resistance\nper square centimeter vs. heat flux for both LHPs and CPL with water, with 130% load.\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 93\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 4.17 \u2013 (a) Total thermal resistance vs. heat load and (b) total thermal resistance\nper square centimeter vs. heat flux for the CPLs.\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 94\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 4.18 \u2013 (a) Total thermal resistance vs. heat load and (b) total thermal resistance\nper square centimeter vs. heat flux for the LHPs.\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 95\n\n4.6 Capillary Limit Analysis of the LHPs and the\n\nCPL\n\nThe main operational limits of capillary pumping systems (CPL and LHP) are the\n\nboiling and capillary limits. In this section, the capillary limit will be explored basing the\n\nanalysis on the experimental results. As explained before, the condition for both CPL and\n\nLHP work is that the total system pressure drop does not exceed the maximum pressure\n\nthat the porous wick can provide. Due to the vapor penetration through the porous wick,\n\nthe operating temperature of the system has a sudden increase when the capillary limit\n\nis exceeded. So, the capillary pumping system operation requires that the sum of the\n\npressure drops in the components and in the transport lines must be smaller than the\n\nmaximum capillary pressure head developed by the wick, i.e.,\n\n?pcap,max ? ?pevap + ?pcond + ?pv + ?pl + ?pg (4.3)\n\nIn the following, the total pressure drop will be estimated based on the measurements\n\nand compared to the expected maximum capillary limit.\n\n4.6.1 Mass Flow Rate\n\nThe mass flow rate can be approximately obtained from the energy balance in the\n\ncompensation chamber and capillary evaporator assembly during steady-state operation.\n\nDuring typical LHP operation, according to Fig. 4.19, heat is applied uniformly to the\n\nevaporator (Qapp). The majority of the overall applied heat load (Qevap) vaporizes the\n\nliquid on the outer surface of the porous wick and superheats the vapor in the vapor\n\nchannel up to the outlet of the evaporator. The other part of the applied heat load is\n\ntransferred through the metallic structure of the assembly to the compensation chamber,\n\nwhere one part is transferred to the ambient (Qcc,amb), and the other part is transferred\n\nto the vapor transport line.\n\nHere, the heat transfer to the vapor transport line will be neglected. Thus, the energy\n\nbalance in the compensation chamber and evaporator requires:\n\nQapp = Qevap + Qcc,amb, (4.4)\n\nwhere\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 96\n\nFigure 4.19 \u2013 Scheme of energy balance in the compensation chamber and capillary evap-\norator assembly.\n\nQevap =\n.\nm hlv +\n\n.\nm cp,v (Tevap,out ?Tevap,sat) +\n\n.\nm cp,l?Tsubcooled, (4.5)\n\nwhere Tevap,out is the temperature of the vapor in the evaporator outlet, Tevap,sat is the\n\nsaturation temperature of the vapor in the evaporator,\n.\nm is the mass flow rate of vapor\n\nand ?Tsubcooled is the liquid temperature difference between the condenser outlet and\n\ncompensation chamber inlet.\n\nThe heat transfer from the compensation chamber surface to the ambient, Qcc,amb =\n\nhcc,ambAcc,out(T\nw\ncc ? Tamb), is assumed to be by natural convection and the heat transfer\n\ncoefficient by convection (hcc,amb) of a horizontal cylinder to the ambient can be estimated\n\nfrom (INCROPERA; DEWITT, 2003),\n\nhcc,amb =\n?airNucc,amb\n\ndcc\n, (4.6)\n\nwhere dcc,out is the outer diameter of the compensation chamber, ?air is the air thermal\n\nconductivity and Nucc,amb is the nusselt number which can be estimated as,\n\nNucc,amb =\n\n???\n??0.60 + 0.387Ra\n\n1/6[\n1 + (0.559/ Prair)\n\n9/16\n]8/27\n\n???\n??\n\n2\n\n; Ra ? 1012 (4.7)\n\nwhere Ra is the Rayleigh number which is calculated as,\n\nRa =\ng?air (Tcc ?Tamb) Lcc\n\n?air?air\n, (4.8)\n\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity, ?air = 1/Tf is the thermal expansion coefficient,\n\n?air is the thermal diffusivity and ?air is the kinematic viscosity of the air and Tf is the\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 97\n\nfilm temperature. All properties of the air were evaluated at the film temperature (Tf ).\n\nThe effects of the sensible heat in the mass flow rate are only secondary in most cases\n\nand can be neglected (\n.\nm hlv ?\n\n[ .\nm cp,l (Tevap,out ?Tevap,sat) +\n\n.\nm cp,l?Tsubcooled\n\n]\n). From\n\nthe applied heat (Qapp), the mass flow rate can be estimated from,\n\nQapp =\n.\nm hlv + hcc,ambAcc,out(Tcc ?Tamb) (4.9)\n\nwhere Tcc is the temperature measured at the wall of the compensation chamber, Tamb is\n\nthe ambient temperature measured and Acc,out is the external area of the compensation\n\nchamber.\n\nSince the reservoir in CPL is separated from the evaporator and assuming that there is\n\nno heat transfer from the evaporator to the ambient (due to insulation of the evaporator),\n\nthe mass flow rate can be estimated from Qapp =\n.\nm hlv.\n\n4.6.2 Fluid Properties\n\nThe fluid properties used in this work were obtained from the software Engineering\n\nEquation Solver (EES) and Peterson (1994). These properties include saturation pressure,\n\nlatent heat, liquid and vapor densities, liquid and vapor viscosities, liquid and vapor\n\nthermal conductivities, liquid and vapor specific heats and liquid surface tension. Further\n\ninformation regarding the fluid properties, used in the present model for the estimation of\n\nthe pressure drop of the capillary pumping systems under study, can be found in Appendix\n\nD.\n\n4.6.3 Single-Phase Pressure Drop\n\nSingle-phase flow is assumed to prevail along the grooves, vapor and liquid trans-\n\nport lines, liquid feeding channel and through the porous wick. The single-phase viscous\n\npressure drop can be estimated from the Darcy-Weisbach equation,\n\n?p = f\n\n(\nL\n\ndh\n\n)(\n?v2\n\n2\n\n)\n(4.10)\n\nwhere f is the Darcy (or Moody) friction factor. For laminar flow in circular tubes,\n\nfRe = 64. For turbulent flow in smooth tubes, the solution proposed by H. Blasius,\n\nf = 0.316Re?0.25 for 4000 &lt;Re &lt;105, is used.\n\nThe flow in the grooves can be shown to be laminar. The friction factor is given by\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 98\n\nfRe = constant, where the Reynolds number is defined in terms of the hydraulic diameter\n\ngiven by\n\ndh =\n2hgroovewgroove\n\n(hgroove + wgroove)\n(4.11)\n\nwhere hgroove and wgroove are the height and width of the grooves, respectively. For the\n\ngrooves of the evaporator of interest, hgroove = 1 mm and wgroove = 1 mm, and therefore,\n\nfRe = 57 (INCROPERA; DEWITT, 2003).\n\nThe pressure drop in the porous wick, according to Darcy\u2019s law, can be written as,\n\nvw,l = ?\nKw\n\u00b5l\n\ndp\n\ndr\n\nor\n\n.\nml = ?lvw,lAw = ?\n\n?l2?rLwKw\n\u00b5l\n\ndp\n\ndr\n, (4.12)\n\nwhere ?l is the liquid density, vw,l is the liquid velocity that flows throug the wick and Aw\n\nis the transversal area of the wick.\n\nIntegrating Eq. 4.12 from rw,in to rw,out, assuming \u00b5l, ?l and Kw are constants, the\n\npressure drop in the porous wick can be calculated from,\n\n?pw =\n\n.\nml\u00b5l\n\n??lLwKw\nln\n\n(\nrw,out\nrw,in\n\n)\n, (4.13)\n\nwhere ? = 2?\n\n(\nNgroovewgroove\n\n2?rw,out\n\n)\nis the angle comprehended by the grooves and Ngroove is\n\nthe number of the grooves in the wick.\n\n4.6.4 Condenser of LHP\n\nIn general, the condensers of CPLs and LHPs present superheated vapor, two-phase\n\nand subcooled liquid regions which depend on the heat load. According to Ku (1994, 1999)\n\nand Maydanik (2005), when the heat load is low (less than ? 50 W for their LHPs), the\nvapor enters the condenser in saturate state and only a small area is necessary to occur the\n\nphase change of the working fluid. Thus, for low heat load, the condenser presents only\n\ntwo regions: two-phase and subcooled liquid. As the heat load of experiments presented\n\nhere (LHPs and CPL) are low, the temperature measured at the wall of condenser inlet\n\nwas assumed as the temperature of the vapor in saturated state that enters the condenser\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 99\n\nof the LHPs, since the pressure of the LHPs was not measured. On the other hand, the\n\npressure of the CPL was measured and this assumption was not needed. This assumption\n\nused for the LHPs is discussed in detail in Appendix D.\n\nFigure 4.20 shows schematically the condenser with finned tube of the LHPs. The\n\nthree regions mentioned before are presented, but here the region of superheated vapor\n\nis neglected due to the low heat load supplied to the LHPs. So, the length of condenser\n\ncan be divided in: Lcond = Lcond,l + Lcond,lv.\n\nFigure 4.20 \u2013 Schematic diagram of the condenser for the LHPs with finned tube.\n\nThe lenght of two-phase (Lcond,lv) and liquid (Lcond,l) regions must be determined in\n\norder to estimate the pressure drop along the condenser. First, an energy balance is\n\napplied in the two-phase region of the condenser, schematically shown in Fig. 4.20.\n\nThe energy balance in the two-phase region provides:\n\n.\nmhlv = (UA)cond,lv ?T\n\ncond,lv\nlm , (4.14)\n\nwhere,\n\n?T\ncond,lv\nlm =\n\n?T\ncond,lv\n1 ? ?T\n\ncond,lv\n2\n\nln\n(\n\n?T\ncond,lv\n1\n\n/\n?T\n\ncond,lv\n2\n\n)\n?T\n\ncond,lv\n1 = Tcond,sat ?THS,out\n\n?T\ncond,lv\n2 = Tcond,sat ?THS,in\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 100\n\n(UA)cond,lv =\n1\n\n1\n\nhcond,lv (?dcond,inLcond,lv)\n+\n\nln\n(\ndcond,out/dcond,in\n\n)\n2??SSLcond,lv\n\n+\n1\n\n?fin,0hHSAt\n\n.

(4.29)\n\nThere are several available correlations to estimate the two-phase heat transfer coef-\n\nficient (hcond,lv). Here, the correlation proposed by Cavallini and Zecchin (KAKAC; LIU,\n\n2002) is used to determine the two-phase heat transfer coefficient,\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 102\n\nhcond,lv = 0.05Re\n0.8\neq Prl\n\n0.33 ?l\ndcond,in\n\n, (4.30)\n\nwhere Reeq = Re\nlv\nv\n\n(\n\u00b5v\n\u00b5l\n\n)(\n?l\n?v\n\n)0.5\n+ Relvl .

(4.32)\n\nThe value of the Reeq varies along the condenser due to the variations in the vapor\n\nfraction (x). In order to arrive at an averaged heat transfer coeficient along the two-phase\n\nregion (h?cond,lv), a model for the variation of x along the condenser is needed. Here, it will\n\nbe assumed that the fluid pressure remains approximately constant along the two-phase\n\nregion such that the ?T for heat transfer is constant and the rate of condensation also\n\nremains constant. Therefore, it will be imposed that,\n\nx = 1 ?\nz\n\nLcond,lv\n,\n\nwhere z is a local coordinate along the two-phase region.

(4.33)\n\nAfter the determination of the two phase length in the condenser, the liquid length is\n\ndetermined as Lcond = Lcond,lv + Lcond,l.\n\nThe two-phase pressure drop consists of gravitational pressure drop, frictional pressure\n\ndrop, and acceleration pressure drop. Since the condenser is placed horizontally, the\n\ngravitational pressure drop in the condenser is identically zero. The pressure drop of the\n\ntwo-phase zone in the condenser is estimated using\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 103\n\n(\ndp\n\ndL\n\n)\nlv\n\n= ?2lv\n\n(\ndp\n\ndL\n\n)\nliq\n\n, (4.34)\n\nwhere ?lv is the two-phase multiplier and\ndp\n\ndL\nis the pressure drop in the two-phase (lv)\n\nand liquid (liq) zones.\n\nThe single-phase pressure drop for liquid flow in the tube can be written as:\n\n(\ndp\n\ndL\n\n)\nliq\n\n= ?\nfliq\n\ndcond,in\n\n(1 ?x)2\n\n2?liq\n\n( .\nm\n\nAcond\n\n)2\n, (4.35)\n\nwhere the liquid-phase friction factor (fliq) can be calculated from the Reynolds number\n\nas discussed previously for single-phase pressure drop.

(4.36)\n\nSubstituting Eq. 4.35 into Eq. 4.34 and applying the chain rule, the two-phase\n\npressure drop becomes a function of vapor fraction (x) as,\n\n(\ndp\n\ndx\n\n)\nlv\n\n= ??2lv\nfliq\n\ndcond,in\n\n(1 ?x)2\n\n2?liq\n\n( .\nm\n\nAcond\n\n)2 (\ndL\n\ndx\n\n)\n(4.37)\n\nAssuming again that there is a linear vapor fraction (x) variation from 1 to 0 over the\n\nlenght of the two-phase region and integrating the Eq. 4.37 over the two-phase length,\n\nwe obtain,\n\n?plv =\n\nx=1?\nx=0\n\n[\n??2lv\n\nfliq\ndcond,in\n\n(1 ?x)2\n\n2?liq\n\n( .\nm\n\nAcond\n\n)2 (\ndL\n\ndx\n\n)]\ndx, (4.38)\n\nwhere the two-phase multiplier can be determined by,\n\n?lv =\n\n(\n1 +\n\nC\n\nX\n+\n\n1\n\nX2\n\n)0.5\n(4.39)\n\nand the Martinelli parameter X can calculated as,\n\nX =\n\n(\nfliq\nfvap\n\n)0.5 (\n?vap\n?liq\n\n)0.5 (\n1 ?x\nx\n\n)\n.

In this type\n\nof coolers, the fan is mounted on top of the fin assembly and pushes air over the fin spacing.\n\nThere is very little information that can be used to estimate the heat transfer coefficient\n\nfor this situation. Therefore, here it is assumed that the air flow passes through the fins\n\nas shown in Fig. 4.21. This assumption can overestimate or subestimate the value of the\n\nheat transfer coefficient, thus, an evaluation of this estimation of heat transfer coefficient\n\nis presented in Appendix D.\n\nFigure 4.21 \u2013 Schematic diagram of the finned condenser for the CPL.\n\nThe lenght of two-phase (Lcond,lv) and liquid (Lcond,l) regions must be determined in\n\norder to estimate the pressure drop along the condenser as in the previous section.\n\nThe energy balance in the two-phase region provides:\n\n.\nmhlv = (UA)cond,lv ?T\n\ncond,lv\nlm , (4.41)\n\nwhere,\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 105\n\n?T\ncond,lv\nlm =\n\n?T\ncond,lv\n1 ? ?T\n\ncond,lv\n2\n\nln\n(\n\n?T\ncond,lv\n1\n\n/\n?T\n\ncond,lv\n2\n\n)\n?T\n\ncond,lv\n1 = Tcond,sat ?Tamb\n\n?T\ncond,lv\n2 = Tcond,sat ?Tamb\n\n(UA)cond,lv =\n1\n\n1\n\nhcond,lv (?dcond,inLcond,lv)\n+\n\nln\n(\ndcond,out/dcond,in\n\n)\n2??SSLcond,lv\n\n+\n1\n\n?fin,0hairAt\n\n.

(4.53)\n\nThe two-phase heat transfer coefficient (hcond,lv) was estimated using the same equa-\n\ntions introduced in the previous section (Condenser of LHP).\n\n4.6.6 Results\n\nThe pressure drop of the capillary pumping systems here under study (two LHPs and\n\none CPL) were evaluated for the maximum heat load applied to the system (15 W for the\n\nLHP (water), 25 W for the LHP (acetone) and 30 W for the CPL). The thermodynamic\n\nproperties of the working fluid were determined at the saturation temperature of the vapor\n\nwithin the condenser. For the CPL, the saturation temperature was estimated using the\n\nmeasured pressure at the system. However, for the LHPs, since the pressure was not\n\nmeasured, the temperature of the condenser inlet (Tcond,in) was assumed as the saturation\n\ntemperature. Further explanations regarding this assumption can be found in Appendix\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 107\n\nD. The Table 4.4 summarizes the estimated results, taking into account the dimensions\n\nfor both LHPs and the CPL tested in the lab.

It is noticed that the contribution of the pressure drop in the vapor\n\nand liquid transport lines and in the two phase zone of condenser are much smaller than\n\nthe pressure drop in the porous wick. The total pressure drop of the CPL (water) is\n\ngreater than the LHP (water) due to the greater mass flow rate and the greater number\n\nof grooves in the evaporator of the CPL. It can also be noticed the total pressure drop\n\nof all capillary pumping systems is up to 57.4% of the capillary limit, showing that,\n\nconsidering this limit, all capillary pumping systems are capable of transfering heat over\n\nlonger distances.\n\nAccording to Ku (1994, 1999), Maydanik (2005) and others, the pressure drop across\n\nthe two phase zone in the condenser can be neglected when compared with the total\n\npressure drop of the capillary pumping systems. As it can be noticed in Table 4.4, the\n\ntwo phase pressure drop in the condenser is very small representing less than 0.5%, due\n\nto the low mass flow rates. Therefore, uncertainties in the evaluation of this contribution\n\nare not very relevant.\n\n4.7 Comparison Between the Experimental and The-\n\noretical Results\n\nThis section presents a comparison between the experimental and theoretical results\n\nobtained with the model presented in Chapter 2. The curves of the critical nondimensional\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 108\n\naverage radius at z? = 1.0 and r? = 0.0 as a function of the nondimensional inlet heat\n\nflux for two porous wick with one-layer and two layers are compared to the experimental\n\nnondimensional average radius for each heat flux applied to the capilary pumping systems\n\ntested in this work. Figure 4.22 presents this comparison.\n\nThe experimental nondimensional average radius was estimated for average pore ra-\n\ndius of 3 \u00b5m and permeability of 1.5 \u00d7 10?14 m2. The input heat fluxes (qin) for each\ncapillary pumping system tested here were estimated as,\n\nqin =\nQapp\n\nNfinAfin\n,\n\nwhere Qapp is the heat transfer rate applied to the capillary evaporator, Nfin is the number\n\nof fins in the capillary evaporator and Afin is the area of one fin.\n\nThe input heat fluxes (qin) for the experiments varied from 5.3 \u00d7 103 to 53.1 \u00d7 103\n\nW/m2 and they are related to the heat loads from 5 to 15 W for the LHP (water), heat\n\nloads from 5 to 25 W for the LHP (acetone) and heat loads from 5 to 30 W for the CPL\n\n(water). The nondimensional input heat fluxes (q?in) varied from 1.3 to 13.3.\n\nFigure 4.22 \u2013 Comparison between the experimental and theoretical results.\n\nIt is noticed in Fig. 4.22 that only the results of the LHP (acetone) reached the\n\ncapillary limit for a porous wick with one-layer. Despite the LHP (acetone) has reached\n\nthe capillary limit, it continued working for heat loads of 20 and 25 W. So, according\n\n\n\n4 Experimental Results and Analysis 109\n\nto the model (presented in Chapter 2), the evaporation front invaded the porous wick\n\nand stablished a stable position within it. However, this comparison should be taken\n\nonly as a first approximation since the theoretical model does not reproduce completely\n\nthe geometry of the tested CPL and LHPs. Nevertheless, the physical trends remain the\n\nsame.\n\nIt is also noticed in Fig. 4.22 that, if a porous wick with two-layers with different\n\nthermal conductivity was used, the capillary limit would increase, showing that the high\n\nthermal conductivity underneath the fin are desirable for capillary pumping systems.\n\n\n\n110\n\n5 Conclusions and\nRecommendations for Future\nWork\n\nIn this last chapter, the general conclusions obtained in this thesis as well as proposals\n\nfor development of future works in modeling and design of LHP and CPL are presented.\n\n5.1 General Conclusions\n\nThis study presents a theoretical and experimental study of two LHPs and one CPL.\n\nRegarding the modeling of the heat and mass transfer problem in capillary evaporators,\n\na criterion for wick dry-out was proposed. Regarding the development of capillary evap-\n\norators of LHP and CPL, a new ceramic porous wick is proposed as an alternative to\n\nwicks made of metal and plastic. These evaporators produced showed reliable operations\n\nfor LHP and CPL applications.\n\n5.2 Modeling Conclusions\n\nIn Chapter 2, two models for the heat and mass transfer problem within the porous\n\nwick of flat capillary evaporators are presented. First, a simplified model allowed ana-\n\nlytical solutions for the velocity and temperature fields within the porous wick of a flat\n\ncapillary evaporator. The analytical solution by separation of variables was possible after\n\nsimpler boundary conditions are applied and this model was based on the model reported\n\nby Cao &amp; Faghri (1994a). Then, an improved model followed by its numerical solution is\n\npresented. The improved model allowed to simulate the heat and mass transfer within a\n\nwick with two layers with different thermophysical properties and to verify the effect of\n\ndesign variables, dimensions, permeability, average pore radius and thermal conductivity\n\nof the wick in the performance of the flat capillary evaporator. Furthermore, the improved\n\nmodel also allowed to test the onset of drying underneath the fin, defining the limit for\n\nthe application of the model which considers the wick fully saturated with liquid.\n\n\n\n5 Conclusions and Recommendations for Future Work 111\n\n5.2.1 Simplified Model\n\nWith the simplified model, it was possible to analyze different types of porous wicks,\n\nworking fluids and the variation of some geometric parameters. This analysis provided\n\nimportant information such as: the decrease of the wick thickness increased the capillary\n\nlimit, however increased both the temperature in the area close to the fin and the heat\n\nflux to the feeding liquid channel. Also, as expected, it was noticed that the smaller\n\nthe thermal conductivity of the porous wick, the greater the temperatures in the area\n\nunderneath the fin. Therefore, the main conclusions from the variation of the parameters,\n\nthickness and thermal conductivity obtained in the simplified model indicate that a good\n\ndesign must seek:\n\n1. an optimum thickness and a high permeability so that the heat flux to the feeding\n\nliquid channel is minimized and the pressure losses remain low;\n\n2. a porous material with optimum thermal conductivity so that the temperature in\n\nthe area underneath the fin is minimized, at the same time that the temperature\n\nin the surface of the liquid channel is also limited. This contraditory need was also\n\nobserved by Figus et al. (1999) that recomended the use of a double layered porous\n\nwick.\n\nThe analysis of the simplified model also revealed that the boundary conditions should\n\nbe improved to match better with the expected physics of the problem. This model also\n\nallows no conclusions regarding the attainment of a capillary limit. Thus, it was verified\n\nthat:\n\n1. the outlet velocity field is not uniform but it must result in higher velocities closer\n\nto the fin;\n\n2. the liquid channel surface temperature must be smaller than the vapor temperature.\n\n5.2.2 Improved Model\n\nWith the improved model, it was possible to simulate the heat and mass transfer\n\nwithin the porous wick with more than one layer with different thermophysical properties.\n\nThis improved model also provided a condition for dryout. The analysis of the porous\n\nwick with one and two layers showed that the wick with two layers is better than with\n\none layer regarding the onset of drying underneath the fin. Other conclusions are:\n\n\n\n5 Conclusions and Recommendations for Future Work 112\n\n1. The capillary limit, or onset drying, stablishes a relation between the pore size (and\n\nall medium properties) and the heat flux. If this limit is reached, the evaporation\n\nfront may penetrate within the porous wick. This can be used as a criterium for the\n\nspecification of the maximum heat flux allowed during operation in steady-state.\n\n2. The larger the thermal conductivity of the porous wick 1 (underneath the fin), the\n\nsmaller is the heat transfer to the liquid feeding channel, causing a smaller increase\n\nof the inlet temperature. The increase of the thermal conductivity of the porous\n\nwick 1 causes the increase of the capillary limit, avoiding the onset of drying of the\n\nregion underneath the fin. The increase of the thermal conductivity also decreases\n\nthe mass flow rate, causing the decrease of the pressure losses through the porous\n\nwick.\n\n3. Finally, the dimensions of the bi-layered wick (R = 15 mm, R\n?\n\n= 7.5 mm, Lz,1 = 4\n\nmm, Lz,2 = 6 mm) and its thermophysical properties can be used for a design of a\n\nflat capillary evaporator.\n\n5.3 Experimental Results and Conclusion\n\nMost LHPs and CPLs use polyethylene or metallic porous wicks and the application\n\nof ceramic porous wicks into the evaporators of capillary pumping systems is scarce. The\n\nceramic wick proposed here proved to be a reliable alternative for its applications in\n\nLHPs and CPLs. Performance tests of two LHPs using acetone and water as working\n\nfluids were carried out for power inputs up to 25 W, taking into account the steady state\n\ncondition, the changes in the heat sink temperature and also different slopes in relation\n\nto the horizontal position of the LHPs. Performance tests of one CPL using water were\n\nalso carried out for power inputs up to 30 W.\n\nThe LHP with acetone and water worked satisfactorily in the ranges from 5 to 25\n\nW and from 5 to 15 W, respectively. Considering the limit temperature of 100 oC, the\n\nmaximum power inputs were 25 W for acetone and 15 W for water. In spite of the LHPs\n\nhave worked satisfactorily, a high temperature difference between the evaporator outlet\n\nand the heat sink was measured, varying from 40 to 80 oC for water and from 30 to 78\n\noC for acetone. The use of acetone as a working fluid ensured better results as compared\n\nwith water.\n\nThe CPL (water) worked satisfactorily in the range from 5 to 30 W. The limit tem-\n\nperature of 100 oC (assumed for safety reasons) was not reached at the outlet evaporator\n\n(Tevap.out) even for 30 W power input.\n\n\n\n5 Conclusions and Recommendations for Future Work 113\n\nThe total thermal resistance was maximum for a heat load of 5 W (8.2 oC/W for\n\nLHP using water and 5.7 oC/W for LHP using acetone) and it was minimum for a heat\n\nload of 20 W (2.9 oC/W for LHP using acetone). The operation with water resulted in a\n\nminimum total thermal resistance of 5.3 oC/W for a heat load of 15 W. The smaller the\n\ntotal thermal resistance, the greater the heat transfer between the hot (evaporator surface)\n\nand cold (heat sink) sources of the capillary pumping systems for a given temperature\n\ndifference.\n\nDespite the quality of LHPs and CPLs has been customarily expressed by the total\n\nthermal resistance (Rtotal), the results obtained with R\n??\n\ntotal showed more reliable for com-\n\nparison of different systems. The results obtained with R\n??\n\ntotal for the CPL (water) were\n\nlarger than the both LHPs, i.e., the LHPs worked better than the CPL (water). The\n\nR\n??\n\ntotal was larger for heat flux of 0.53 W/cm\n2 (52.8 oC/W/cm2 for CPL using water) and\n\nheat flux of 1.06 W/cm2 (38.8 oC/W/cm2 for LHP using water and 27.0 oC/W/cm2 for\n\nLHP using acetone) and it reached the lowest values in the range measured for heat flux\n\nof 3.18 W/cm2 (31.7 oC/W/cm2 for CPL and 25.0 oC/W/cm2 for LHP, both using water)\n\nand heat flux of 5.3 W/cm2 (14.7 oC/W/cm2 for LHP using acetone).\n\nComparing the results of the present work with the results reported in the literature\n\nregarding the R\n??\n\ntotal, the CPL (water) worked better than all CPLs reported in the lit-\n\nerature reviewed in this work. On the other hand, despite the LHPs did not work as\n\nwell as the mini-LHPs, they presented satisfactory results. One possible reason for this\n\nrelatively poor result is that the mini-LHPs reported by the other authors used ammnonia\n\nas working fluid which, due to its thermal properties, is considered the best working fluid\n\nfor capillary pumping systems.\n\nThe total pressure drop of all systems were estimated and no systems reached the\n\ncapillary limit. It was noticed that the contribution of the pressure drop in the vapor and\n\nliquid transport lines and in the two phase zone of condenser were much smaller than the\n\npressure drop in the porous wick. Besides, the total pressure drop of the CPL (water) was\n\ngreater than the LHP (water) due to the greater mass flow rate and the greater number\n\nof grooves in the evaporator of the CPL. As it could be noticed in the results, the two\n\nphase pressure drop in the condenser was very small representing less than 0.5%, due to\n\nthe low mass flow rates. Therefore, uncertainties in the evaluation of this contribution\n\nwere not very relevant.\n\nThe experimental results were compared with the theoretical results obtained with the\n\nmodel. Only the results of the LHP (acetone) reached the capillary limit for a porous wick\n\nwith one-layer. Despite the LHP (acetone) has reached the capillary limit, it continued\n\nworking for heat loads of 20 and 25 W. So, according to the model (presented in Chapter\n\n\n\n5 Conclusions and Recommendations for Future Work 114\n\n2), the evaporation front invaded the porous wick and stablished a stable position within\n\nit. However, this comparison should be taken only as a first approximation since the\n\ntheoretical model does not reproduce completely the geometry of the tested CPL and\n\nLHPs. Nevertheless, the physical trends remain the same. If a porous wick with two-\n\nlayers with different thermal conductivity was used instead of a porous wick with one-layer,\n\nit was observed that the higher the thermal conductivity underneath the fin the higher\n\nthe capillary limit.\n\nFinally, further research is still required in order to reduce the operation temperature,\n\nevaluating changes related to the properties of the ceramic wick (porosity, pore size and\n\nthermal conductivity) and improvements in the whole design of LHPs and CPL.\n\n5.4 Future Works\n\nThis study initiated the research at LabCET (Laboratory of Combustion and Thermal\n\nSystems Engineering, Federal University of Santa Catarina in Brazil) and IKE (Institute of\n\nNuclear Technology and Energy Systems, Stuttgart University in Germany) regarding the\n\nfeasibility of the ceramic wick application in LHP and CPL using water as working fluid.\n\nThe main objectives of this work, the application of a ceramic wick in capillary pumping\n\nsystems (LHPs and CPLs) and the mathematical model which allow to determine the\n\nvapor invasion threshold of the porous wick, were attained, however future research is\n\nneed. In the author\u2019s opinion, the following research directions can be investigated in the\n\nfuture:\n\n? Adaptation of the model for the actual cylindrical geometry of the capillary evapo-\n\nrators tested here.\n\n? Design mini-LHPs and mini-CPLs in order to apply them in notebooks and desktops.\n\n? Design and manufacture a LHP and/or CPL with devices to measure pressure drops\n\nalong the system and temperature distribution inside the capillary evaporator.\n\n? Test the LHP and the CPL in microgravity environment for space application.\n\n? Manufacture a ceramic wick with higher thermal conductivity, changing for instance\n\nthe percentage of mullite from 80 to 20% and alumina from 20 to 80%.\n\n\n\n115\n\nReferences\n\nARPACI, V. S.

For the modeling, the\n\nporous wick is a flat circular disc and is assembled between the liquid feeding channel and\n\nthe vapor chamber. Figure A.1 presents a rendering of the porous wick modeled. The\n\nupper part of the wick is heated by an external heat flux. The evaporation process that\n\ntakes place in the wick of the capillary evaporator depends on the applied thermal load on\n\nthe system and it is assumed that it may occur in three regimes: microfilm evaporation,\n\nevaporation at the external surface of the wick and evaporation within the wick.\n\nFigure A.1 \u2013 Cross-section view of the flat capillary evaporator with cylindrical geometry.\n\nFigure A.2 presents a unit cell formed by a half of a single fin and the region of the\n\nporous wick bounded by the two symmetry surfaces. In Fig. A.2(a), an external heat\n\nflux is supplied to the capillary evaporator and a liquid microfilm is formed between the\n\nexternal surface of the porous wick and the vapor grooves as modeled by Demidov &amp;\n\nYatsenko (1994). Since the inner surface temperature of the fin is higher than the liquid\n\ntemperature, the liquid microfilm tends to dry out. After the microfilm dries out, the\n\nevaporation interface migrates to the external surface of the porous wick, as depicted in\n\n\n\nAppendix A Volume Averaged Equations of Energy and Mass Conservation 121\n\nFig. A.2(b). If the thermal load continues increasing, a capillary pressure threshold is\n\nreached and the evaporation front moves to within the porous wick, as shown in Fig.\n\nA.2(c). Here, only the evaporation regime in the external surface of the wick is studied.\n\nFollowing Li &amp; Ochterbeck (1999), this is the safest operation condition.\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\nFigure A.2 \u2013 (a) Microfilm evaporation (b) evaporation at the outer surface and (c)\nevaporation within the porous wick.\n\nA.1 Local Problem\n\nAssuming the existence of a liquid-vapor interface, according to Fig. A.3, in which the\n\nmass flow rate of liquid, that flows by capillary action through the porous wick, becomes\n\nvapor and flows via the grooves forward the condenser. This interface is composed by\n\nseveral menisci.\n\nFigure A.3 \u2013 The local problem of phase change within porous wick of a capillary pumping\nsystem. Rendering of the surface of the porous wick during evaporation.\n\nSince in this work the attention is focused on the evaporation of the liquid in the\n\nupper surface of the porous wick, the porous medium is sutarated with liquid and the\n\nevaporation only takes place in the boundary of the domain. The phase solid of the\n\nporous wick is inert and impermeable to the fluid phases. The conservation equations\n\n\n\nAppendix A Volume Averaged Equations of Energy and Mass Conservation 122\n\nthat govern the phenomena are presented as follows. The mass conservation equation for\n\nliquid phase:\n\n? (?l)\n\n?t\n+ ?\u00b7 (?lvl) = 0 (A.1)\n\nThe energy equation for the liquid and solid phases are:\n\n? (?lcp,lTl)\n\n?t\n+ ?\u00b7 (?lvlcp,lTl) = ??\u00b7 ql (A.2)\n\n? (?scp,sTs)\n\n?t\n= ??\u00b7 qs (A.3)\n\nThe conduction heat fluxes in the solid and liquid phases are given by Fourier\u2019s Law\n\nas,\n\nqs = ??s?Ts\n\nql = ??l?Tl\n\nThe momentum conservation equation (Navier-Stokes) for a compressible flow for the\n\nliquid phase:\n\n?l\n\n(\n?vl\n?t\n\n+ vl \u00b7?vl\n)\n\n= ??pl + \u00b5?2vl + ?lf (A.4)\n\nThe boundary conditions for the interface solid-liquid may be represented as:\n\nvl = 0 on Asl (A.5)\n\n?l?Tl \u00b7 n?ls = ?s?Ts \u00b7 n?sl on Asl (A.6)\n\nTl = Ts on Asl (A.7)\n\nThe boundary conditions for the interface liquid-vapor in the upper surface of the\n\nporous wick may be represented as:\n\n?l (vl) \u00b7 n?lv + ?v (vv) \u00b7 n?vl = 0 on Alv (A.8)\n\n\n\nAppendix A Volume Averaged Equations of Energy and Mass Conservation 123\n\nTl = Tv on Alv (A.9)\n\npcap = pv ?pl on Alv (A.10)\n\nThe analysis of heat and mass transfer in porous wicks is a difficult task, because there\n\nare limitations, even using modern computers, in the calculation of the detailed profiles of\n\nthe variables such as: temperature, pressure and velocities. There are two methods which\n\nhave been more used for solving the heat and mass transfer problem with phase change in\n\nporous wick: volume averaging method (continuum approach) and pore network method.\n\nHere, only the volume averaging method will be presented. Further information about\n\nthe application of pore network method for solving the heat and mass transfer problem\n\nin porous wick can be found in Figus et al. (1999). The set of equations, presented above,\n\nis solved using the volume averaging method.\n\nA.2 Volume Averaging Method\n\nThe fields of temperature, pressure and velocities can be obtained with the macro-\n\nscopic model using the volume averaging method. This method will be applied to the\n\ngovern equations of the heat and mass transfer phenomena in porous wick with phase\n\nchange, which takes place in the external surface of the porous wick. For the volume av-\n\neraging method, first it is necessary to choose a representative elementary volume (REV),\n\nas shown in Fig. A.4. REV is the smallest differential volume that results in statistically\n\nmeaningful local average properties, i.e., a small increase in the REV does not change the\n\naveraged properties. This requires that,\n\ndp ? lREV ? Lwick\n\nwhere dp is the pore characteristic diameter, lREV is the characteristic length of the REV\n\nand Lwick is the largest characteristic length of the problem.\n\nSome definitions and theorems are presented here to better understand the volume\n\naveraging method. First, applying the volume average to the temperature of the solid\n\nphase for example:\n\n?Ts? =\n1\n\nV\n\n?\nV\n\nTsdV (A.11)\n\n\n\nAppendix A Volume Averaged Equations of Energy and Mass Conservation 124\n\nFigure A.4 \u2013 Schematic averaging volume\n\nSince Ts is defined only in the solid phase and is zero in all other phases, Eq.

However in drying processes, the\n\ntemperature of the liquid phase is equal to the solid one due to the relatively low convective\n\ntransport rates. Under these circumstances one is encouraged to assume that conductive\n\ntransport is sufficient to eliminate significant tamperature differences between the separate\n\nphases. Then, in order to obtain the total energy equation in volume average for solid\n\nand liquid phases, it is reasonable to assume the local thermal equilibrium between the\n\nphases, i.e., the temperatures in each phase are equal (?Tl?\nl\n= ?Ts?\n\ns\n= ?T?).

Grid refinement tests were performed\n\nin order to evaluate the quality of the numerical code and solution. First, the numerical\n\ncode is analyzed using a methodology of manufactured solution, which was proposed by\n\nEc?a &amp; Hoekstra (2008). Next, the numerical solution is analyzed using the Richardson\n\nextrapolation in order to estimate the uncertainties of the numerical solution, which was\n\nproposed by Marchi &amp; Silva (2002, 2005) and also implemented by Oliveira (2008).\n\nB.1 Verification of the Numerical Code\n\nThe maturing of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes for pratical calculations\n\nin engineering implies the need to stablish the credibility of the results by verification and\n\nvalidation (Ec?A; HOEKSTRA, 2008). The verification of calculations is a purely mathemat-\n\nical exercise that intends to show that we are solving correctly the equations of the model.\n\nOn the other hand, the validation is a science and engineering activity that intends to\n\nshow that we are solving the right equations for the model. Here, only the verification is\n\npresented.\n\nAccording to Roache (1998), the verification of the calculations is composed of two\n\ndifferent processes: i) Code verification - verify that a given code solves correctly the\n\nequations and that there are not any errors in the code or inconsistences in the algorithm\n\nsolution; and ii) Solution Verification - quantify the numerical erros in the computational\n\nsimulation.\n\nThe exact solution of the mathematical model or of a manufactured solution can be\n\nused for the code verification. In the Method of Manufactured Solution (MMS), first a\n\n\n\nAppendix B Verification Study of the Numerical Code and Solution 132\n\ncontinuum solution is constructed. In general, this constructed solution will not satisfy the\n\ngoverning equations (continuity and momentum) because of the arbitrary nature of the\n\nchoice. But by adding an appropriate source term, which removes any imbalance caused\n\nby the choice of the continuum solution, the governing equations are forced to become\n\na model for the constructed solution. Further information about the MMS method can\n\nbe found in Ec?a &amp; Hoekstra (2008, 2009). Here, the exact solution of the methamatical\n\nmodel will be used for the code verification.\n\nTwo models were presented in Chapter 2: Simplified and Improved Models. It was\n\ndeveloped an exact solution for the simplified model and a numerical solution for the\n\nimproved model. A CFD code was developed in FORTRAN 90 for the numerical solution\n\nof the improved model. In order to verify this CFD code, the boundary conditions of the\n\nimproved model were changed for the boundary conditions of the simplified model, which\n\nwas analytically solved. That is, the CFD code solved the simplified model numericaly for\n\nsix different grids. The monitoring of the errors was done using the Root Mean Squared\n\n(RMS) error as,\n\nRMS(e?) =\n\n??Nr\ni=1\n\n?Nz\nj=1\n\n(\n?Numi,j ??exact\n\n)2\nNr \u00d7 Nz\n\n, (B.1)\n\nwhere RMS(e?) is the RMS error of the variable ? (T - temperature or p - pressure), Nr\n\nand Nz are the numbers of nodes of the grid in the r and z directions, respectively. i and\n\nj are the nodes counters, ?Numi,j is the numerical solution for the node counter and ?exact\n\nis the exact solution.\n\nThe RMS errors of the temperature RMS(eT ) and pressure RMS(ep) are presented\n\nin Fig. B.1 for a grid refinement and heat flux of 4.0 \u00d7 104 W/m2.\n\nSix grids were used and they are identified as (?50\u00d750), (?100\u00d7100), (?150\u00d7150), (?200\u00d7200),\n\n(?250\u00d7250) and (?300\u00d7300). In this notation, ?Nr\u00d7Nz represents a grid with Nr and Nz points.\n\nFigure B.1 presents in the abscissa, a relative ratio between the six grids (?i) and the coarse\n\ngrid (?50\u00d750). It can be noticed in both figures that the more refined the grid, the smaller\n\nthe RMS errors for both variables. It can also be noticed that the curves of RMS(eT ) and\n\nRMS(ep) present an assymptotic behavior and the errors of the RMS(eT ) was 0.00054\noC\n\n(0, 054%) and the RMS(ep) was 0.0140 Pa (1.40%) for a grid of ?150\u00d7150. Therefore, since\n\nthe RMS errors were estimated below 2% for both fields of temperature and pressure, the\n\ngrid (?150\u00d7150) was chosen.\n\n\n\nAppendix B Verification Study of the Numerical Code and Solution 133\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure B.1 \u2013 (a) RMS error of the temperature and (b) pressure as a function of grid\nrefinement.\n\nB.2 Verification of the Numerical Solution\n\nThe analysis of the numerical solution was accomplished by the successive refinements\n\nof the grids. Figures B.2 and B.3 present the grid refinements for the temperature and\n\npressure fields, respectively, at two locations in the computational domain (z = Lz and\n\nz = Lz/2) and for the same heat flux of 4.0 \u00d7 104 W/m2. Five grids are shown and it\nis noticed that the more refined the grid, the smaller becomes the difference between the\n\nresults. For instance, the differences among the results of the grids (?150\u00d7150), (?200\u00d7200)\n\nand (?250\u00d7250) are almost indistinguishable.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure B.2 \u2013 Temperature distribution along r at z = Lz (a) and (b) at z = Lz/2 for a\nheat flux of 4.0 \u00d7 104 W/m2 and different grids.\n\n\n\nAppendix B Verification Study of the Numerical Code and Solution 134\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure B.3 \u2013 Pressure distribution along r at z = Lz (a) and (b) at z = Lz/2 for a heat\nflux of 4.0 \u00d7 104 W/m2 and different grids.\n\nA methodology for estimating the uncertainties of the numerical solution is applied as\n\nfollows. Oliveira (2008) presents in detail a methodology for estimating the uncertainties\n\nof numerical solutions, which is based on the Richardson Error Estimator following Marchi\n\n&amp; Silva (2002, 2005). This methodology is briefly presented as follows. First, the area\n\naveraged temperature and pressure are determined as,\n\nT? =\n1\n\nA\n\n? Lz\n0\n\n? r\n0\n\nT(r,z)rdrdz (B.2)\n\np? =\n1\n\nA\n\n? Lz\n0\n\n? r\n0\n\np(r,z)rdrdz. (B.3)\n\nNext, seven grids, (?50\u00d750), (?100\u00d7100), (?150\u00d7150), (?200\u00d7200), (?250\u00d7250), (?300\u00d7300) and\n\n(?400\u00d7400) were used for calculating the average temperature and pressure. Tables B.1 and\n\nB.2 present the average temperature and pressure, respectively, the grid refinement ratio\n\n(?), the percentage of variation of the averaged values of T and p when compared to the\n\nprevious grid and the CPU time for each grid. These results were used in the calculation\n\nof the numerical uncertainties.\n\nAssuming that the possible mistakes made during the development of the CFD code\n\nand the errors of iteration are small, the true discretization error E(?) of any variable\n\nof interest (?) can be defined as the difference between the numerical (?num) and exact\n\n(?exact) solutions,\n\nE(?) = ?num ??exact (B.4)\n\n\n\nAppendix B Verification Study of the Numerical Code and Solution 135\n\nTable B.1 \u2013 Grid refinement of the numerical solution for the average temperature.\n\nGrid (?r\u00d7z) ?

On\n\n\n\nAppendix B Verification Study of the Numerical Code and Solution 137\n\nthe other hand, Fig. B.4(b) presents the superconvergent interval, in which the values\n\nof the apparent order (?app) are positive, decreasing and greater than the value of the\n\nasymptotic order (?as). For solutions of complex problems, ?app does not reach exactly\n\n?as since for that it would be necessary an infinite number of control volumes.\n\nIf the apparent order (?app) is monotonic convergent, as it is presented in Figs. B.4(a)\n\nand (b) within the dashed area, then the exact analytical solution (?exact) will be bound\n\nbetween ?est(?as) and ?est(?app) and they can be estimated as,\n\n?est (?as) = ?1 +\n?1 ??2\n??as ? 1\n\n(B.9)\n\n?est (?app) = ?1 +\n?1 ??2\n\n??app ? 1\n(B.10)\n\nAccording to Marchi &amp; Silva (2005), Eqs. B.9 and B.10 are the generalized Richardson\n\nextrapolation. Replacing them in Eq. B.5, the uncertainty or estimated error of the\n\nnumerical solution for the apparent and asymptotic orders is obtained as,\n\nURi (?as,?1) =\n?1 ??2\n??as ? 1\n\n(B.11)\n\nURi (?app,?1) =\n?1 ??2\n\n??app ? 1\n, (B.12)\n\nwhich represent the estimated errors of the numerical solution ?1 according to the Richard-\n\nson error estimator (URi) (MARCHI; SILVA, 2005).\n\nMarchi &amp; Silva (2005) demonstrate that the discretization error of a given numeri-\n\ncal solution (?1) is bound between the values of URi(?as,?1) and URi(?app,?1) for the\n\nsubconvergent and superconvergent as follows,\n\nURi (?as,?1)\n\nE(?1)\n? 1 ?\n\nURi (?app,?1)\n\nE(?1)\n(B.13)\n\nURi (?app,?1)\n\nE(?1)\n? 1 ?\n\nURi (?as,?1)\n\nE(?1)\n(B.14)\n\nThe value of the uncertainty is considered reliable when the ratio between URi and E is\n\nequal or greater than unit. Since the accuracy of the uncertainty depends on the difference\n\nbetween ?app and ?as, the more the value of ?app approaches the value of ?as, the values\n\nof\nURi (?as,?1)\n\nE(?1)\nand\n\nURi (?app,?1)\n\nE(?1)\ntend to unity and the estimate of the discretization\n\n\n\nAppendix B Verification Study of the Numerical Code and Solution 138\n\nerror becomes more accurate (MARCHI; SILVA, 2005).\n\nSince the equations of the numerical model for solving the energy and the momen-\n\ntum problems were discretized using central discretization scheme (CDS), Marchi &amp; Silva\n\n(2005) suggest that the asymptotic order (?as) should be equal to 2.0. Table B.3 presents\n\nthe estimated variables for the calculation of the numerical uncertainties using the gen-\n\neralized Richardson extrapolation. It is noticed that as the grid is refined, the values\n\nof the apparent order (?app) tend monotonically to the values of the asymptotic order\n\n(?as = 2.0) in a subconvergent interval. So, the discretization error is within the interval\n\n(URi (?as,?1) ? E(?1) ? URi (?app,?1)) when the ?app is within the subconvergent inter-\nval. The upper limit of this interval is the numerical uncertainty obtained with the fine\n\ngrid (?1) of each group analyzed composed by three grids, which are presented in Tables\n\nB.1 and B.2.\n\nTable B.3 \u2013 Estimated variables for the calculation of the uncertainty U using the gener-\nalized Richardson extrapolation.\n\nEstimated Grid Grid Grid Grid Grid\nvariables 50,100,150 100,150,200 150,200,250 200,250,300 250,300,400\n\n?2,1 1.50 1.33 1.25 1.20 1, 33\n?3,2 2.00 1.50 1.33 1.25 1.20\n\n?2 ??3\n?1 ??2\n\n2.95(2.11) 1.99(1.77) 1.66(1.56) 1.56(1.48) 0, 86(0, 83)\n\n?ap 0.97(0.37) 0.96(0.63) 1.03(0.78) 1.18(0.92) 1.30(1.11)\nIRi (?as,?1) 0.048(1.66) 0.039(1.53) 0.03(1.34) 0.03(1.16) 0.02(0.80)\nIRi (?ap,?1) 0.12(12.55) 0.095(5.99) 0.07(4.00) 0.05(2.80) 0.03(1.65)\n\nI (?1) 0.12(12.55) 0.095(5.99) 0.07(4.00) 0.05(2.80) 0.03(1.65)\nURi (?app,?1)\n\nURi (?as,?1)\n2.59(7.54) 2.44(3.92) 2.19(2.99) 1.83(2.41) 1, 72(2, 06)\n\nNote: the values within parentheses ( ) refer to the pressure field presented in Table B.2.\n\nSince that there are no analytical solutions for the temperature and pressure fields,\n\naccording to Oliveira (2008), the methodology proposed by Marchi &amp; Silva (2002) can be\n\nused when the values of apparent order (?app) approach or, at least, tend to the values\n\nof the asymptotic order (?as), that is, the estimate of the error is more accurate and the\n\nratio between estimated uncertainty and the real error tend to unit, making the estimate\n\nmore reliable.\n\nIn the lack of analytical solutions, the ratio\nURi (?app,?1)\n\nURi (?as,?1)\nindentifies when the numer-\n\nical solution is accurate and reliable.

For that grid, the numerical solutions for the temperature and\n\npressure fields are ?T = 38.41 \u00b1 0.038 oC and ?p = 2285 \u00b1 5.443 Pa, respectively.\n\n\n\n141\n\nAPPENDIX C\n\nMeasurement Uncertainty Analysis\n\nThis appendix deals with the measurement uncertainty analysis regarding the ex-\n\npirements accomplished at LabCET/UFSC in Brazil and at IKE/Stuttgart University in\n\nGermany. First is presented the theory for the measurement uncertainty analysis, which is\n\nbased on the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement, ISO (2008). Next,\n\nit is separately presented the assessing of uncertainties for the temperature and power\n\ninput measurements at both laboratories.\n\nC.1 Theory of Assessing Uncertainty\n\nUncertainty exists in the measurements and the degree to which the uncertainty af-\n\nfects the conclusion is an important issue. According to ISO (2008), the objective of a\n\nmeasurement is to determine the value of the measurand, that is, the value of the par-\n\nticular quantity to be measured. A measurement, therefore, begins with an appropriate\n\nspecification of the measurand, the method of measurement and the measurement pro-\n\ncedure. In general, the result of a measurement is only an approximation or estimate of\n\nthe value of the measurand and, thus, it will be complete only when accompanied by a\n\nstatement of the uncertainty of that estimate.\n\nThe simplest way of assessing uncertainty is to make many measurements and to use\n\nthe obtained results to estimate the range of possible values. Uncertainties estimated in\n\nthis way, using actual measurement and statistical analysis, are called Type A uncertain-\n\nties. On the other hand, when statistical sampling is impractical and the information\n\nfor the analysis is brought by physical theory, information from handbooks or varying\n\ndegrees of experience of similar situations, these uncertainties are called Type B uncer-\n\ntainties. Here, both types of uncertainty are used.\n\n\n\nAppendix C Measurement Uncertainty Analysis 142\n\nC.1.1 Standard Uncertainty\n\nThe standard uncertainty (u) of a source of uncertainties is defined as uncertainty\n\nof the result of a measurement expressed as a standard deviation. The estimation of\n\nstandard uncertainty related to a source of uncertainties can be done through statistic\n\nprocedures or by others means.\n\nThere are several situations where the experimental standard deviation associated\n\nto a source of uncertainties can be estimated from values of repeated observation of the\n\nmeasurand. According to ISO (2008), uncertainties estimated in this way are called Type\n\nA uncertainties.\n\nSuppose that a random variable q represents the effects of a source of uncertainties\n\nregarding the measurement result. The experimental standard deviation of this variable\n\nq is determined from n values independently obtained for the variable q, i.e., qk (where\n\nk = 1, 2, ...,n). So, the arithmetic mean of variable q can be expressed as:\n\nq? =\n1\n\nn\n\nn?\nk=1\n\nqk. (C.1)\n\nThe experimental standard deviation (s) of variable q is estimated as,\n\ns (q) =\n\n????? n?k=1 (qk ? q?)2\nn? 1\n\n(C.2)\n\nThis estimate of the experimental standard deviation s (q) characterizes the variability\n\nof the observed values qk, or more specifically, their dispersion about their mean q?. If\n\nonly one measurement is done, the standard uncertainty is expressed by: u(q) = s(q).\n\nHowever, if n measurements are done and their mean value is used for the calculation of\n\nthe measurement result, the standard uncertainty corresponds to the standard deviation\n\nof the mean of the n measurements, i.e.,\n\nu (q) = s (q?) =\ns (q)\n?\nn\n\n(C.3)\n\nType B uncertainties are those determined by other than statistical means. There are\n\nseveral situations where it is not practical or possible to use estatistical procedures for\n\nestimation of the experimental standard deviation related to a source of uncertainties. So,\n\naccording to Nicholas &amp; White (2005), the evaluation of the uncertainties can be based\n\non theoretical models of the measurement, information from handbooks and data sheet,\n\n\n\nAppendix C Measurement Uncertainty Analysis 143\n\nthe work of other experiments, calibration certificates, even intution and experience.\n\nAccording to ISO (2008), the proper use of available information for the Type B evalu-\n\nation of standard uncertainty calls for insight based on experience and general knowledge.\n\nIt should be recognized that the Type B evaluation of standard uncertainty can be as\n\nreliable as the Type A evaluation, especially in a measurement situation where the Type\n\nA evaluation is based on a comparatively small number of statistically independent ob-\n\nservations.\n\nIf the error estimate is taken from a manufacturer\u2019s specification, calibration certifi-\n\ncate, handbook, or other source and its quoted uncertainty is stated to be a particular\n\nmultiple of a standard deviation, the standard uncertainty is simply the value of error\n\ndivided by the multiplier. According to ISO (2008), the normal probability distribution\n\nis assumed for type A uncertainties and the multiplier is one (1). On the other hand, the\n\nrectangular probability distribution is assumed for type B uncertainties and the multi-\n\nplier is the square root of three (\n?\n\n3). Here in this work, it is made the same assumptions\n\nas made by ISO (2008), i.e., normal probability distribution is assumed for type A and\n\nrectangular probability distribution for type B.\n\nC.1.2 Combined Standard Uncertainty\n\nThe variables of input quantities that contribute for the uncertainties can be corre-\n\nlated or uncorrelated. The random variables are called statisticaly independent (or un-\n\ncorrelated) when there is not any relation between the random increasing of one and the\n\nrandom increasing (or decreasing) of another. On the other hand, the random variables\n\nare called statisticaly interdependent (or correlated) when there is a noticable relation be-\n\ntween the random increasing of one and the random increasing (or decreasing) of another\n\nin a proportional way to the first one. Here, all contributing uncertainties are uncorrelated\n\n(or independent) and the equations for estimation of that uncertainties are presented as\n\nfollows.\n\nIn most measurements there is more than one source of uncertainty. Assuming that a\n\ndetermined measurand z is not measured directly, but is determined from independent (or\n\nuncorrelated) random variables x, y and other variables through a functional relationship\n\nf:\n\nz = f(x,y, ...). (C.4)\n\nThe standard uncertainty of z, where z is the estimate of the measurand z and thus\n\n\n\nAppendix C Measurement Uncertainty Analysis 144\n\nthe result of the measurement, is obtained by appropriately combining the standard un-\n\ncertainties of the input estimates x, y and other variables of function f. The combined\n\nstandard uncertainty of the estimate z is denoted by uc(z) according to ISO (2008) and\n\nit can be expressed by\n\nuc (z) =\n\n???? n?\ni=1\n\n(\n?f\n\n?x\n\n)2\nu2 (x) +\n\n(\n?f\n\n?y\n\n)2\nu2 (y) + ..., (C.5)\n\nwhere u(x), u(y) and other variables are the standard uncertainties of each source of\n\nuncertainty.\n\nC.1.3 Effective Number of Degrees of Freedom\n\nThe number of degrees of freedom is used in statistical distributions (e.g., in Student\u2019s\n\nt-distribution) to account the number of random uncorrelated variables used to calculate\n\nthe variance. In general, the degrees of freedom of an estimate (?) is equal to the number\n\nof independent variables used to calculate the experimental standard deviation minus one,\n\ni.e.,\n\n? = n? 1. (C.6)\n\nEquation C.6 should be used for the calculation of number of degrees of freedom\n\nfor type A uncertainties. On the other hand, for the type B uncertainties, in which is\n\nassumed to have rectangular probability distribution, according to ISO (2008), the number\n\nof degrees of freedom should be infinite.\n\nAccording to Nicholas &amp; White (2005), when the standard uncertainty of several\n\nsources of uncertainties are considered to estimate the combined standard uncertainty, the\n\nnumber of degrees of freedom resultant from the combined standard uncertainty should\n\nbe also estimated. This can be done by Welch-Satterthwaite equation,\n\nu4c\n?eff\n\n=\nu41\n?1\n\n+\nu42\n?2\n\n+ ... +\nu4p\n?p\n, (C.7)\n\nwhere ?1, ?2, ..., ?p are the numbers of degrees of freedom and u1, u2, ..., up are the\n\nstandard uncertainties of each p sources of uncertainties.\n\n\n\nAppendix C Measurement Uncertainty Analysis 145\n\nC.1.4 Expanded Uncertainty\n\nAccording to ISO (2008), although the combined standard uncertainty (uc) can be\n\nuniversally used to express the uncertainty of a measurement result, it is necessary to give\n\na measure of uncertainty that defines an interval concerning the measurement result that\n\nmay be expected to encompass a large fraction of the distribution of values that could\n\nreasonably be attributed to the measurand. The additional measure of uncertainty that\n\nmeets the requirement of providing this interval is called expanded uncertainty (U).\n\nIn engineering applications is common to design within levels of confidence of 95%. For\n\nthat, the combined standard uncertainty (uc) should be multiplied by a coverage factor\n\nk (Student coefficient) for obtaining the expanded uncertainty (U). According to ISO\n\n(2008), this coverage factor is commonly represented by the symbol k95% for confidence\n\nlevel of 95%. The expanded uncertainty (U95%) corresponds to a range of values that\n\nencompass the uncertainty with confidence leval of about 95% and it is estimaded by:\n\nU95% = k95%uc. (C.8)\n\nC.2 Assessing Uncertainties of the Temperature Mea-\n\nsurements at IKE/Stuttgart University\n\nIn this work, all tests of LHPs were carried out at Institute of Nuclear Technology\n\nand Energy Systems (IKE) of Stuttgart University in Germany. Here, it is presented\n\nthe assessing of uncertainties of these experiments for the temperature measurements.\n\nBoth types of uncertainties are evaluated here, e.g., the type A uncertainties which are\n\ndue to the repeatability errors of the temperature measurements (uRe) and the type B\n\nuncertainties (obtained by catalogs and norms), which are due to the errors of the data\n\nlogger (uDL) and the temperature sensors (uPt100).\n\nC.2.1 Type A Uncertainties\n\nThe type A uncertainties were evaluated due to the repeatability errors of the tem-\n\nperature measurements. The temperatures along the LHP were measured for a steady\n\nstate condition for each step of heat load. n measurements of temperature were collected\n\nin steps of time of 30 s during 20 min for each sensor and each step of heat load. Thus,\n\naccording to Eqs. C.1, C.2 and C.3, the uncertainty due to the repeatability errors (uRe)\n\ncan estimated as,\n\n\n\nAppendix C Measurement Uncertainty Analysis 146\n\nT? =\n1\n\nn\n\nn?\nk=1\n\nTk (C.9)\n\ns (T) =\n\n????? n?k=1\n(\nTk ? T?\n\n)2\nn? 1\n\n(C.10)\n\nuRe =\ns (T)\n?\nn\n, (C.11)\n\nwhere n is equal to 40 measurements, Tk are the n measurements of the measurand T and\n\nT? is the arithmetic mean.\n\nAll temperature sensors used for the temperature measurements along the LHPs were\n\nevaluated in order to estimate the uncertainty due to the repeatability errors, however\n\nfor simplifying reasons, only the greatest standard uncertainty among the temperature\n\nsensors is presented in Table C.1.\n\nC.2.2 Type B Uncertainties\n\nThe type B uncertainties (obtained by catalogs and norms) are due to the errors of\n\nthe data logger (uDL) and the temperature sensors (uPt100). The temperature distribution\n\nalong the LHP was measured using temperature sensors (RTDs) of type Pt100 delivered\n\nwith an accuracy of class A. Regarding to international norm IEC751 (1983), the error of\n\nthe RTDs can be estimated by following equation:\n\nuPt100 = 0.15 + 0.002T, (C.12)\n\nwhere T is the operation temperature of the Pt100, which range from ?100 to +450 oC.\nHere, this error was evaluated for limiting operation temperature of 100 oC and the result\n\nis presented in Table C.1.\n\nThe error of the temperature measurement for RTDs at the data logger(uDL) was\n\nobtained in the accuracy specification of the catalog of the Agilent 34970A (Data Acqui-\n\nsition/Switch Unitsare), which is estimated as 0.06 oC.\n\nC.2.3 Combined Standard Uncertainty\n\nThe sources of uncertainties mentioned before - repeatablility, data logger and tem-\n\nperature sensors - are composed by uncorrelated variables. So, the combined standard\n\n\n\nAppendix C Measurement Uncertainty Analysis 147\n\nuncertainty for the temperature measurements, according to Eq. C.5, can be expressed\n\nas,\n\nuc (T) =\n\n?(\n?T\n\n?TRe\n\n)2\nu2Re (TRe) +\n\n(\n?T\n\n?TDL\n\n)2\nu2DL (TDL) +\n\n(\n?T\n\n?TPt100\n\n)2\nu2Pt100 (TPt100),\n\n(C.13)\n\nwhere\n?T\n\n?TRe\n=\n\n?T\n\n?TDL\n=\n\n?T\n\n?TPt100\n= 1 and Eq. C.13 becomes,\n\nuc (T) =\n?\nu2Re (TRe) + u\n\n2\nDL (TDL) + u\n\n2\nPt100 (TPt100). (C.14)\n\nC.2.4 Expanded Uncertainty\n\nFor the estimation of the expanded uncertainty, it is necessary to determine the cover-\n\nage factor (k) which is function of the confidence level and the effective number of degrees\n\nof freedom (?eff ). It assumed the confidence level of 95% and the effective number of\n\ndegrees of freedom is estimated using the Eq. C.7. In ISO (2008), there is a Table with\n\nthe values of coverage factor (k) from a statistical distribution which is function of degrees\n\nof freedom (?) for different levels of confidence. Usually when the effective number of de-\n\ngrees of freedom (?eff ) is great, the coverage factor (k95%) is equal to 2.0 for a confidence\n\nlevel of 95%.\n\nC.2.5 Results\n\nTable C.1 presents the summary of standard uncertainty components for the tem-\n\nperature measurement. It is noticed that the number of degrees of freedom is great\n\n(?eff = 2.57\u00d71011) and the k95% is equal to 2.0. Therefore, the expanded uncertainty for\nthe temperature measurement is estimated as \u00b10.41 oC.\n\nC.3 Assessing Uncertainties of the Temperature Mea-\n\nsurements at LabCET/UFSC\n\nThe tests of the CPL were carried out at Laboratory of Combustion and Engineering\n\nof Thermal Systems (LabCET) of Federal University of Santa Catarina in Brazil. Here, it\n\nis presented the assessing of uncertainty of this experiment for the temperature measure-\n\nments. It was accomplished the same procedure that was presented in previous section.\n\nBoth types of uncertainties are evaluated, however in the type A uncertainties is included\n\n\n\nAppendix C Measurement Uncertainty Analysis 148\n\nTable C.1 \u2013 Summary of standard uncertainty for the temperature measurement at\nIKE/Stuttgart University\n\nStandard Source Value Type Value Degrees\nuncertainty of of of Divider of standard of\ncomponent uncertainty errors Distribution uncertainty freedom\n\nuRe Repeatability 0.005 Normal 1.0 0.005 39\n\nuDL Data Logger 0.06 Rectangular\n?\n\n3 0.035 ?\nuPt100 RTD Pt10 0.35 Rectangular\n\n?\n3 0.202 ?\n\nCombined\nuc standard \u2014 Normal \u2014 0.205 2.57 \u00d7 1011\n\nuncertainty\nExpanded\n\nU95% uncertainty \u2014 Normal \u2014 0.41 \u2014\n(95%)\n\nthe uncertainty (uCal) due to the errors of thermocouples calibration for the temperature\n\nmeasurements.\n\nC.3.1 Type A Uncertainties\n\nThe type A uncertainties were evaluated due to the errors of repeatability (uRe) and\n\nthermocouples calibration (uCal) for the temperature measurement. The temperatures\n\nalong the CPL were measured for a steady state condition for each step of heat load. n\n\nmeasurements of temperature were collected in steps of time of 30 s during 20 min for\n\neach sensor and each step of heat load. The uncertainty due to the repeatability errors\n\n(uRe) was estimated using Eqs. C.1, C.2 and C.3. Again, all thermocouples used for\n\nthe temperature measurements along the CPL were evaluated, however for simplifying\n\nreasons, only the greatest standard uncertainty among the thermocouples is presented in\n\nTable C.2.\n\nThe thermocouples calibration was done using a reference thermometer which has\n\nthe operation range from ?10 to +100 oC and accuracy of 0.01 oC. The thermocouples\nand the reference thermometer were imersed in a heat sink, which used water as working\n\nfluid. The heat sink temperature was varied in a range from 10 to 80 oC in steps of 5\n\noC. The results of the temperature measurements with the thermocouples were compared\n\nwith the reference thermometer results. Finally, the experimental standard deviations\n\nfor each thermocouple was calculated. All thermocouples were evaluated based on the\n\nexperimental standard deviation, but only the greatest standard uncertainty (uCal) among\n\nthe errors of thermocouples calibration is presented in Table C.2.\n\n\n\nAppendix C Measurement Uncertainty Analysis 149\n\nC.3.2 Type B Uncertainties\n\nThe type B uncertainties (obtained only by catalogs) are due to the errors of the data\n\nlogger (uDL) and the termocouples (uThermocouple).

The data input, the thermophysical properties and the\n\nmain results of the hydrodynamic model for each capillary pumping systems (Two LHPs\n\nand one CPL) are also presented.\n\nD.1 Introduction\n\nThe main operational limit of capillary pumping systems (CPL and LHP) are the\n\nboiling and capillary limits. Here, the capillary limit will be explored basing the analysis\n\non the experimental results. The condition for both CPL and LHP work is that the total\n\nsystem pressure drop does not exceed the maximum pressure that the porous wick can\n\nprovide. So, the capillary pumping system operation requires that the sum of the pressure\n\ndrops in the components and in the transport lines must be smaller than the maximum\n\ncapillary pressure head developed by the wick, i.e.,\n\n?pcap,max ? ?pevap + ?pcond + ?pv + ?pl + ?pg\n\nIn order to estimate the total pressure drop of the LHPs and CPL, a hydrodynamic\n\nmodel was developed based on the measurements and the results were compared to the\n\nexpected maximum capillary limit. The hydrodynamic model is composed by the set of\n\nequations already presented in Chapter 4. For the LHPs, this set of equations is solved\n\naccording to the following steps:\n\n(1) Input data such as the LHP dimensions, working fluid, Qapp, TCC, Tamb, TCond,in,\n\nTCond,out, THS,in, THS,out and\n.\nmHS are supplied to the model.\n\n(2) The thermophysical properties of the working fluid are estimated as a function of\n\nthe working fluid saturation temperature in the condenser. Next, the mass flow rate is\n\n\n\nAppendix D Hydrodynamic Model for Pressure Drop 156\n\ncalculated using Eqs. 4.1 to 4.9.\n\n(3) The pressure drops in the porous wick - Eqs. 4.10 and 4.13 - and in the grooves -\n\nEqs. 4.10 and 4.11 - as well as in the vapor transport line, Eq. 4.10, are estimated.\n\n(4) The condenser two-phase region lenght (Lcond,lv) is estimated using the Eqs. 4.14\n\nto 4.33. Next, the length of liquid region (Lcond,l) is estimated subtracting the two-phase\n\nlength (Lcond,lv) from the total condenser length (Lcond).\n\n(5) The pressure drop in the liquid transport line is estimated using Eq. 4.10.\n\n(6) The condenser two-phase region pressure drop is estimated using Eqs. 4.34 to\n\n4.40.\n\nConsidering now the CPL, the set of equations is solved as follows:\n\n(1) Input data such as the CPL dimensions, Qapp, Tamb, PSensor, TCond,in and TCond,out\n\nare supplied to the model.\n\n(2) The working fluid thermophysical properties are estimated as a function of the\n\nsaturation temperature, which was calculated regarding the pressure measured with the\n\npressure sensor. Next, the mass flow rate is calculated by Qapp =\n.\nm hlv.\n\n(3) The pressure drops in the porous wick, Eqs. 4.10 and 4.13, in the grooves, Eqs.\n\n4.10 and 4.11, and in the vapor transport line, Eq. 4.10, are estimated.\n\n(4) The condenser two-phase region lenght (Lcond,lv) is estimated using the Eqs. 4.41\n\nto 4.53. Next, the length of liquid region (Lcond,l) is estimated subtracting the two-phase\n\nlength (Lcond,lv) from the total condenser length (Lcond).\n\n(5) The pressure drop in the liquid transport line is estimated using Eq. 4.10.\n\n(6) The condenser two-phase region pressure drop is estimated using Eqs. 4.34 to\n\n4.40.\n\nD.2 Saturation Temperature of the CPL and LHPs\n\nFrom the previous section, one can notice that the saturation temperature is needed\n\nin step (2) in order to estimate the working fluid thermophysical properties to be used in\n\nboth CPL and LHPs models. On the one hand, for the CPL model, the system pressure\n\nwas measured and its saturation temperature could be determined. On the other hand,\n\nfor the LHP model, it was not possible to determine the saturation temperature in the\n\ncondenser (or in any other component) based only on temperature measurements at LHP\n\nwalls. Thus, the working fluid saturation temperature was assumed as the temperature\n\n\n\nAppendix D Hydrodynamic Model for Pressure Drop 157\n\nmeasured at the wall of the condenser inlet. The reasons for that assumption are presented\n\nas follows.\n\nThe LHP startup occurs when the temperature measured at the condenser inlet in-\n\ncreases suddenly. Figure D.1, which was already presented in Chapter 4 and is repeated\n\nhere for didactical purposes, shows the steady state of LHP (using water as working fluid)\n\nfor an increasing heat load. As the heat load is applied, it is noticed that the evapora-\n\ntor outlet temperature increases. After some seconds, the condenser inlet temperature\n\nincreases suddenly as well, showing that the LHP has started up. It should be observed\n\nthat the condenser inlet temperature presents an unstable behavior only for the 5 W heat\n\nload, probably due to the formation and possible colapse of bubbles before the condenser\n\ninlet. As the heat load increases to 10 W, that behavior disappears. To some extend, the\n\npresence of this instability indicates that vapor enters the condenser at saturated state.\n\nFigure D.1 \u2013 Temperatures of LHP (water) for heat loads increasing at horizontal position\nand at heat sink temperature of 20 oC (Already presented in Chapter 4).\n\nFigure D.2 presents the results for temperatures along the CPL and the pressure\n\nmeasured at the liquid line for three different heat loads (Qapp = 10, 20 and 30 W). The\n\nmean pressure was 8.22, 11.61 and 13.23 kPa for heat load of 10, 20 and 30 W, respectively.\n\nBased on the results presented in the previous figure, the saturation temperature was\n\nestimated as a function of the mean pressure. Figure D.3 presents this temperature, the\n\ncondenser inlet temperature and their correspondent uncertainties. The results show that\n\nthe temperatures are in the range of the uncertainty. Therefore, the assumption that\n\nthe saturation temperature becomes closer to the temperature measured at the condenser\n\n\n\nAppendix D Hydrodynamic Model for Pressure Drop 158\n\nFigure D.2 \u2013 Temperatures and pressure of the CPL for heat loads increasing at horizontal\nposition and with 130% load.\n\ninlet does not involve great errors. It should be addressed that this assumption was taken\n\nonly for the LHPs.\n\nFigure D.3 \u2013 Saturation temperature (as a function of the mean measured pressure),\ncondenser inlet temperature and their correspondent uncertainties.\n\nFor the CPL model, the saturation temperature in the condenser was estimated as a\n\nfunction of the pressure measured. Since the pressure sensor is located at the liquid line,\n\nthe saturation temperature in the condenser is different from the saturation temperature\n\nestimated as a function of the pressure. This difference was estimated using the Clausius-\n\n\n\nAppendix D Hydrodynamic Model for Pressure Drop 159\n\nClapeyron equation, as follows,\n\n(Tcond,sat ?Tsensor,sat) = ?p\nTsensor,satvlv\n\nhlv\n, (D.1)\n\nwhere Tcond,sat is the condenser saturation temperature, Tsensor,sat is the saturation tem-\n\nperature estimated as a function of the pressure measured with the sensor, ?p is the\n\npressure drop between the condenser inlet and the location of the pressure sensor at the\n\nliquid line.\n\nThe results obtained with Eq. D.1 showed that the difference between the saturation\n\ntemperatures was less than 0.05% for the maximum heat load of 30 W.\n\nD.3 Heat Transfer Coeffient of the Air Flow in the\n\nCondenser of the CPL\n\nTwo finned air coolers were used to cool the condenser section of the CPL. In this\n\ntype of coolers, the fan is mounted on top of the fin assembly and pushes air over the fin\n\nspacing. There is very little information that can be used to estimate the heat transfer\n\ncoefficient for this situation. Therefore, here it is assumed that the air flow passes through\n\nthe fins as shown in Fig. D.4.\n\nFigure D.4 \u2013 Schematic diagram of the finned condenser for the CPL.\n\nThis assumption can overestimate or subestimate the value of the heat transfer co-\n\nefficient. In order to evaluate its influence on the total pressure drop of the CPL, the\n\nheat transfer coefficient of the air flow was varied. Table D.1 shows the results of the\n\ntwo-phase length, two-phase region pressure drop and its percentage as well as the total\n\nCPL pressure drop as a function of the air flow heat transfer coefficient.\n\nDespite all the parameters decreased with the heat transfer coefficient increase, the\n\ntotal CPL pressure drop decayment was relative small and the equations presented in\n\n\n\nAppendix D Hydrodynamic Model for Pressure Drop 160\n\nTable D.1 \u2013 Evaluation of the air flow heat transfer coefficient.\nhair Llv ?plv Percentage ?ptotal\n\n(W/m-K) (mm) (Pa) (%) (Pa)\n30 90.4 35.54 0.41 8.754 \u00d7 103\n50 65.1 25.59 0.29 8.744 \u00d7 103\n100 53.8 21.15 0.24 8.740 \u00d7 103\n160 50.5 19.85 0.23 8.738 \u00d7 103\n\nChapter 4 to estimate the air flow heat transfer coefficient can be applied without involving\n\nsignificant errors.\n\nD.4 Data Inputs and Themophysical Properties\n\nThis section presents the input data and the thermophysical properties which were\n\ndetermined as a function of the saturation temperature in the condenser.

The\n\ntotal pressure drop of the CPL (water) is greater than the LHP (water) due to the greater\n\nmass flow rate and the greater number of grooves in the evaporator of the CPL. It can\n\nalso be noticed the total pressure drop of all capillary pumping systems is up to 57.4%\n\nof the capillary limit, showing that, considering this limit, all capillary pumping systems\n\nare capable of transfering heat over longer distances.\n\nTable D.8 \u2013 Pressure drop of the LHPs and CPL.\n\nLHP LHP CPL\n(Water) (Acetone) (Water)\n\nComponents ?p (Pa) % ?p (Pa) % ?p (Pa) %\nVapor grooves 77.84 7.04 47.673 0.723 1.38 \u00d7 103 15.76\nVapor line 38.89 3.52 30.654 0.465 206.3 2.36\nPorous wick 987.42 89.25 6.511 \u00d7 103 98.688 7.13 \u00d7 103 81.63\nLiquid line 0.46 0.04 2.363 0.036 2.15 0.02\nTwo phase 1.69 0.15 5.863 0.089 19.89 0.23\n?ptotal 1.106 \u00d7 103 100.00 6.598 \u00d7 103 100.00 8.74 \u00d7 103 100.00\nCapillary limit 41.78 \u00d7 103 \u2014 11.5 \u00d7 103 \u2014 45.14 \u00d7 103 \u2014\n?ptotal/p\n\n?\ncap,max 0.03 \u2014 0.574 \u2014 0.19 \u2014\n\n? is the maximum capillary pressure which is estimated using the Eq. 1.2 (pcap,max =\n2?\nrp\n\n)."}]}}}
