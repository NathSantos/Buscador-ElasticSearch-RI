Posteriormente, uma combina\u00e7\u00e3o de m\u00e9todos \ndependentes e independentes de cultivo foi utilizada para investigar o \nefeito de contamina\u00e7\u00e3o com OH sobre a estrutura e fun\u00e7\u00e3o da \ncomunidade bacteriana end\u00f3fitica das hal\u00f3fitas. Os sistemas radiculares \nde H. portulacoides e S. perennis subsp. perennis parecem exercer uma \nforte influ\u00eancia sobre a composi\u00e7\u00e3o bacteriana e a an\u00e1lise metageomica \n\u201cin silico\u201d revelou um enriquecimento em genes envolvidos no processo \nde degrada\u00e7\u00e3o de hidrocarbonetos arom\u00e1ticos polic\u00edclicos (PAHs) na \nrizosfera de plantas hal\u00f3fitas.

As comunidades \nendof\u00edticas revelaram um efeito local, relacionado com caracter\u00edsticas \ndo sedimento, tal como, o n\u00edvel de contamina\u00e7\u00e3o de OH. \n\n \nA fim de determinar se a inocula\u00e7\u00e3o da H. portulacoides com bact\u00e9rias\ndegradadoras de hidrocarbonetos podem mitigar os efeitos negativos da\nexposi\u00e7\u00e3o das plantas \u00e0 contamina\u00e7\u00e3o por hidrocarbonetos, bem como \navaliar as respostas em termos de estrutura e fun\u00e7\u00e3o das comunidades \nbacterianas associada \u00e0 ra\u00edz de plantas (rizosfera e endosfera), foi \ndesenvolvida uma experi\u00eancia de microcosmos. A hal\u00f3fita Halimione \nportulacoides foi inoculada com uma estirpe de Pseudomonas sp., uma \nbact\u00e9ria endof\u00edtica degradadora previamente isolada, e cultivada em \nsedimentos experimentalmente adicionados com 2-metilnaftaleno. \nEmbora os resultados n\u00e3o tenham demonstrado um efeito significativo \ndo contaminante sobre a condi\u00e7\u00e3o da planta, a redu\u00e7\u00e3o da \nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o de 2-metilnaftaleno no sedimento no final da experi\u00eancia \nsugere que H. portulacoides pode ser considerada como uma planta \ncom potencial interesse para aplica\u00e7\u00e3o na fitorremedia\u00e7\u00e3o de zonas de \nsapal contaminadas com hidrocarbonetos arom\u00e1ticos. Apesar da\ndegrada\u00e7\u00e3o do hidrocarboneto n\u00e3o ter sido acelerada pela inocula\u00e7\u00e3o \ndas plantas com uma estirpe de Pseudomonas sp. degradadora, esta \nparece ter exercido um efeito positivo sobre a condi\u00e7\u00e3o das plantas, \nindependentemente da adi\u00e7\u00e3o de 2-metilnaftaleno. Os efeitos da\ninocula\u00e7\u00e3o sobre a estrutura da comunidade end\u00f3fitica observada no \nfinal da experi\u00eancia indicam que a estirpe pode ser uma colonizadora \neficiente das ra\u00edzes da H. portulacoides.  \nOs resultados obtidos neste trabalho sugerem que a H. portulacoides \ntolera concentra\u00e7\u00f5es moderadas de 2-metilnaftaleno podendo assim ser \nconsiderada como um agente promissor para processos de \nfitoremedia\u00e7\u00e3o em sapais contaminados com hidrocarbonetos de \npetr\u00f3leo. As plantas suportam comunidades bacterianas endof\u00edticas \ndiversas e enriquecidas em fatores g\u00e9neticos (genes) relacionados com \ndegrada\u00e7\u00e3o de hidrocarbonetos e as intera\u00e7\u00f5es planta/bact\u00e9ria podem \nassumir um importante papel nos processos de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n \n\nSalt marshes,  hydrocarbons, plant/bacteria interaction, endophytic \nbacteria, phytoremediation \n \n \n \n\nabstract \n \n \n\nSalt marshes are highly productive intertidal habitats that serve as \nnursery grounds for many commercially and economically important \nspecies. Because of their location and physical and biological \ncharacteristics, salt marshes are considered to be particularly vulnerable \nto anthropogenic inputs of oil hydrocarbons. Sediment contamination \nwith oil is especially dangerous for salt marsh vegetation, since low \nmolecular weight aromatic hydrocarbons can affect plants at all stages of \ndevelopment. However, the use of vegetation for bioremediation \n(phytoremediation), by removal or sequestration of contaminants, has \nbeen intensively studied. Phytoremediation is an efficient, inexpensive \nand environmental friendly approach for the removal of aromatic \nhydrocarbons, through direct incorporation by the plant and by the \nintervention of degrading microbial populations in the rhizosphere \n(microbe-assisted phytoremediation). Rhizosphere microbial \ncommunities are enriched in important catabolic genotypes for \ndegradation of oil hydrocarbons (OH) which may have a potential for \ndetoxification of the sediment surrounding the roots. In addition, since \nrhizosphere bacterial populations may also internalize into plant tissues \n(endophytes), rhizocompetent AH degrading populations may be \nimportant for in planta AH degradation and detoxification.  \n \nThe present study involved field work and microcosms experiments \naiming the characterization of relevant plant-microbe interactions in oil-\nimpacted salt marshes and the understanding of the effect of \nrhizosphere and endosphere bacteria in the role of salt marsh plants as \npotential phytoremediation agents. \n\n \nIn the field approach, molecular tools were used to assess how plant \nspecies- and OH pollution affect sediment bacterial composition [bulk \nsediment and sediment surrounding the roots (rhizosphere) of Halimione \nportulacoides and Sarcocornia perennis subsp. perennis] in a temperate \nestuary (Ria de Aveiro, Portugal) chronically exposed to OH pollution. In \naddition, the 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved in this study were \nused to generate in silico metagenomes and to evaluate the distribution \nof potential bacterial traits in different microhabitats. Moreover, a \ncombination of culture-dependent and -independent approaches was \nused to investigate the effect of oil hydrocarbons contamination on the \nstructure and function of endophytic bacterial communities of salt marsh \nplants.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nRoot systems of H. portulacoides and S. perennis subsp. perennis \nappear to be able to exert a strong influence on bacterial composition \nand in silico metagenome analysis showed enrichment of genes involved \nin the process of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) degradation in \nthe rhizosphere of halophyte plants. The culturable fraction of endophytic \ndegraders was essentially closely related to known OH-degrading \nPseudomonas species and endophytic communities revealed site-\nspecific effects related to the level of OH contamination in the sediment.  \n \n\n \nIn order to determine the effects of oil contamination on plant condition \nand on the responses in terms of structure and function of the bacterial \ncommunity associated with plant roots (rhizosphere, endosphere), a \nmicrocosms approach was set up. The salt marsh plant Halimione \nportulacoides was inoculated with a previous isolated Pseudomonas sp. \nendophytic degrader and the 2-methylnaphthalene was used as model \nPAH contaminant. The results showed that H. portulacoides health and \ngrowth were not affected by the contamination with the tested \nconcentration. Moreover, the decrease of 2-methylnaphthalene at the \nend of experiment, can suggest that H. portulacoides can be considered \nas a potential plant for future uses in phytoremedition approaches of \ncontaminated salt marsh. The acceleration of hydrocarbon degradation \nby inoculation of the plants with the hydrocarbon-degrading \nPseudomonas sp. could not, however, be demonstrated, although the \neffects of inoculation on the structure of the endophytic community \nobserved at the end of the experiment indicate that the strain may be an \nefficient colonizer of H. portulacoides roots. \n \nThe results obtained in this work suggest that H. portulacoides tolerates \nmoderate concentrations of 2-methylnaphthalene and can be regarded \nas a promising agent for phytoremedition approaches in salt marshes \ncontaminated with oil hydrocarbons. Plant/microbe interactions may \nhave an important role in the degradation process, as plants support a \ndiverse endophytic bacterial community, enriched in genetic factors \n(genes and plasmids) for hydrocarbon degradation.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\"In the great battles of life, the first step to victory is the desire to win.\" \n \n \n\nMahatma Gandhi \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMedia\u00e7\u00e3o microbiana na recupera\u00e7\u00e3o de sapais contaminados \n\ncom hidrocarbonetos \n\n \n\nMicrobe-mediated recovery of salt marshes contaminated with oil \n\nhydrocarbons \n\n\n\nList of Publications \n\n \n\nThis thesis includes results which have already been published in the journals listed \n\nbelow: \n\n \n\nOliveira V., Gomes N.C.M., Almeida A., Silva A.M.S., Silva H., Cunha A.

The anthropogenic pressure associated to human activities, namely \n\nnavigation and industries commonly developing around estuarine areas, are often the \n\ncause for the rapid degradation of the estuarine environment. Hydrocarbons are a major \n\ncontaminant in estuarine salt marsh areas and because of the ecological, commercial and \n\neconomic importance of these wetlands, restoration approaches based on natural \n\nrecovery processes are being intensively studied.  \n\nMicrobe-assisted phytoremediation is an inexpensive and environment-friendly \n\napproach based on the interactions between plants and their associated indigenous \n\ndegrading microorganisms (rhizo- and endosphere). Although phytoremediation of a \n\nvariety of contaminants in different environments has been reported in the last years, \n\nstudies on phytoremediation of hydrocarbons in salt marsh sediments using halophytes \n\nsalt marsh plants are strikingly scarce. So, studies focused on the \n\nrhizosphere/endosphere microorganisms, essential for salt marsh vegetation to resist \n\nenvironment contamination, could be of great value for the development of new \n\napproaches for the mitigation of oil contamination events.  \n\nSimilarly to what is known for terrestrial plants, the roots of salt marsh halophytes \n\nharbour communities of microorganisms that are enriched in important catabolic \n\ngenotypes for oil hydrocarbon (OH) degradation which may have a potential for \n\ndetoxification of the surrounding sediment (Geiselbrecht et al., 1996, Daane et al., \n\n2001, Watts et al., 2007). In addition, since rhizosphere bacterial populations may also \n\ninternalize into plant tissues (endophytes), rhizocompetent OH degrading populations \n\nmay be important for in planta OH degradation and detoxification. In this context, \n\ninformation on how bacterial populations colonizing salt marsh plants respond to oil \n\ncontamination and how they can contribute to OH detoxification may significantly \n\ncontribute to the understanding of plant-microbe interactions underlying \n\nphytoremediation approaches. \n\n \n\nChapter 1 presents an introduction to the recent scientific knowledge on \n\nbiodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in estuarine environments, the strategies \n\ncurrently available for bioremediation (potential and limitations) and summarizes the \n\n\n\nThesis Outline \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nperspectives of the use of halophytes in microbe-assisted phytoremediation approaches. \n\nThis chapter was published in the journal Microbial Ecology with the following \n\nreference: MECO-D-14-00127.1; DOI: 10.1007/s00248-014-0455-9 \n\n \n\nChapter 2 reports on a thorough in-depth molecular characterization of bacterial \n\ncommunities in bulk sediments and rhizosphere microhabitats of salt marshes of Ria de \n\nAveiro, a temperate estuary chronically exposed to oil hydrocarbon (OH) pollution.  \n\nThe barcoded pyrosequencing approach used in this study provided a comprehensive \n\noverview of the rhizosphere bacterial communities in salt marsh microhabitats [bulk \n\nsediment and sediment surrounding the roots (rhizosphere) of Halimione portulacoides \n\nand Sarcocornia perennis subsp. perennis] differentially affected by oil hydrocarbon \n\n(OH) pollution. In addition, the 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved were used to \n\ngenerate in silico metagenomes and to evaluate the distribution of potential bacterial \n\ntraits in different microhabitats. The results revealed that root systems of H. \n\nportulacoides and S. perennis subsp. perennis appear to be able to exert a strong \n\ninfluence on bacterial composition. The in silico metagenome analyses showed a \n\npossible higher number of genes involved in the process of PAH degradation in the \n\nrhizosphere of halophyte plants. These observations suggests that halophyte plant \n\ncolonization can be an important driver of hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria community \n\nstructure in salt marsh sediments, which can be exploited for in situ phytoremedition of \n\noil hydrocarbon in salt marsh environments.

A previously isolated PAH-degrading endophytic strain of Pseudomonas sp. \n\n(chapter 3) was used as plant inoculum. The effect of 2-methylnaphthalene \n\ncontamination on plant condition was evaluated by measurement of the photosynthetic \n\nactivity using a non-destructive technique, PAM fluorometry. The responses of \n\nmicrobial communities (rhizosphere and endosphere) in terms of structure [denaturing \n\ngradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)] and function [polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon \n\n(PAH) dioxygenase genes] were assessed. The results indicate that the salt mash plant \n\nH. portulacoides can influence microbial communities by stimulating the development \n\nof hydrocarbon-degrading populations that may contribute to hydrocarbon removal and \n\ndegradation in salt marsh sediments. The inoculation with an endophytic hydrocarbon-\n\ndegrading bacterium does not result in a significant effect on the overall hydrocarbon \n\ndegradation potential of the salt marsh halophyte H. portulacoides. However, the effect \n\nof the inoculant on the structure of the indigenous endophytic community indicates that \n\nthe strain may be a good plant colonizer. \n\n \n\nChapter 5 integrates and discusses the main results of this work and attempts to \n\nextract the main findings, highlighting conclusions that can be incorporated into \n\ninnovative and more efficient strategies of microbe-assisted phytoremediation of coastal \n\nareas.  \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n12 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\nMicrobe-assisted phytoremediation of hydrocarbons in estuarine environments \n\n \n\nVanessa Oliveira, Newton C.M.

The demand \n\nfor organisms and processes capable of degrading pollutants in a clean, effective, and \n\nless expensive process is of great importance. Phytoremediation approaches involving \n\nplant/bacteria interactions have been explored as an alternative, and halophyte \n\nvegetation has potential for use in phytoremediation of hydrocarbon contamination. \n\nStudies with plant species potentially suitable for microbe-assisted phytoremediation are \n\nwidely represented in the scientific literature. However, the in-depth understanding of \n\nthe biological processes associated with the re-introduction of indigenous bacteria and \n\nplants and their performance in the degradation of hydrocarbons is still the limiting step \n\nfor the application of these bioremediation solutions in a field context. \n\nThe intent of the present review is to summarize the sources and effects of \n\nhydrocarbon contamination in estuarine environments, the strategies currently available \n\nfor bioremediation (potential and limitations), and the perspectives of the use of \n\nhalophyte plants in microbe-assisted phytoremediation approaches. \n\n \n\nKeywords: salt-marshes; hydrocarbons; halophytes; phytoremediation \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\nSalt marshes are complex coastal environments usually situated within estuarine \n\nsystems. They represent dynamic habitats, developing along the coast line and inside \n\nestuaries and are characterized by high concentration of soluble salts (prevailing NaCl), \n\nrelatively low diversity of species and high biomass productivity (Vernberg, 1993, \n\nBaptista et al., 2011). Estuarine salt marshes are among the most productive ecosystems \n\non Earth (Costanza et al., 1997) promoting plant and microbial activity (Cunha et al., \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n13 \n\n \n\n2005, Santos et al., 2007, Oliveira et al., 2010), representing a preferential habitat for \n\nmany organisms (fish, bird and other wildlife) (Mitsch &amp; Gosselink, 2000, Watts et al., \n\n2006) and providing important ecosystem services (Barbier et al., 2011). Salt marshes \n\nare highly dynamic areas, influenced by the joint action of water, sediment, and \n\nvegetation, providing a buffer zone between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in urban \n\nand industrial areas. They contribute to flood control and erosion prevention and may \n\nact as protective filters and final repositories for runoff pollutants, pathogens and \n\nnutrients (Vernberg, 1993, Valiela et al., 2004, Barbier et al., 2011). \n\nSalt marshes are sinks for various pollutants, receiving important anthropogenic \n\ninputs from urban areas, industries and agricultural compounds, namely polycyclic \n\naromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), \n\ndichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), \n\nhexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and hexachlorodimethanonaphthalene (Dieldrin), as \n\nsummarized in Table 1.1. Due to their ecological importance, the cleanup and recovery \n\nof these ecosystems is an issue of public concern. \n\nPetroleum hydrocarbons (PHs) represent one of the most common groups of \n\npersistent organic pollutants in coastal and estuarine systems (Mucha et al., 2011). They \n\nare continuously released, persistent in the environment, toxic to many organisms, and \n\nhazardous to human health (Todd et al., 1999). This class of contaminants may be \n\noriginated from industrial release products or from accidental spills (Todd et al., 1999). \n\nNumerous studies indicate that salt marsh sediments are capable of retaining PHs and \n\nthat the stimulation of microbial activity in the rhizosphere of plants can accelerate their \n\nbiodegradation (Carman et al., 1996, Daane et al., 2001). Phytoremediation is one of the \n\nprocesses of hydrocarbon bioremediation, which has been intensively studied in the last \n\ndecade. The continuous release of hydrocarbons and their degradation products caused \n\nby anthropogenic activities around estuary areas leads to the necessity for efficient, \n\ninexpensive, and environmental friendly processes of hydrocarbon decontamination, \n\nsuch as phytoremediation. In that perspective, the interactions between halophytes, \n\nplants capable of growing in salt marshes, and their root-associated bacteria may play a \n\nrelevant role in the remediation of contaminated areas. Cultivation-dependent and -\n\nindependent approaches together with molecular approaches have been used to \n\ncharacterize plant hydrocarbonclastic bacteria partnerships in the perspective of their \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n14 \n\n \n\nexploitation for microbe-assisted phytoremediation. However, particular features of salt \n\nmarsh ecosystems may impose difficulties in the process of implementation of these \n\nstrategies in the field, and considerable research effort has been directed to a deeper \n\nunderstanding of halophyte-microbe interactions in oil-polluted environments. \n\nThe purpose of this paper is to summarize recent knowledge on the degradation of \n\npetroleum hydrocarbons in salt marsh sediments and to critically discuss the potential \n\nand limitations of microbe-assisted phytoremediation approaches for the recovery of oil-\n\nimpacted ecosystems. \n\n \n\nTable 1.1 Concentration of various pollutants detected in sediments at estuaries from \n\naround the world. \n\nSite Pollutanta Concentration (\u00b5 g/g)b Reference \n\nCharleston Harbor Estuary, South \nCarolina, USA \n\nAl 8.54 \n\nSanger et al., \n1999 \n\nCd 0.28 \n\nCr 94.1 \n\nCu 32.4 \n\nFe 4.28 \n\nPb 31.7 \n\nMn 247.7 \n\nHg 0.13 \n\nNi 28.1 \n\nZn 111.7 \nChesapeake Bay, Maryland, USA Cd 17.6 \n\nMcGee et al., \n1999 \n\nCr 1,831.1 \n\nCu 396 \n\nFe 14.74 \n\nMn 3,381.0 \n\nNi 157.7 \n\nPb 348.6 \n\nZn 2,105.4 \n\nHg 2,340.3 \n\nPAHs 23,322.8 \n\nPCBs  2,148.2 \nSan Francisco Bay, California, USA Cd 5.733 \n\nO'Day et al., \n2000 \n\nNi 39.677 \n\nCu 126.076 \n\nPb 265.229 \n\nZn 295.527 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n15 \n\n \n\nTable 1.1 (continued) \n\nSite Pollutanta Concentration (\u00b5 g/g)b Reference \n\nHumber Estuary, Eastern England Cu 60 \n\nLee &amp; \nCundy, 2001 \n\n Pb 127 \n Zn 344 \n\n HCB  0.022 \n HCH 0.003 \n\n Dieldrin  0.167   \nSuir Estuary, Ireland Cu  23.194 Fitzgerald et \n\nal., 2003  Pb 69.208 \nBay of Fundy, Canada \n\nHg 0.079 \nHung &amp; \nChmura, \n2006 \n\nMersey Estuary, U.K. PAHs 3.766 Vane et al., \n2007  PCBs 1.409 \n\nSalt marsh along coastal zone of Portugal \nHg > 10 to &lt;0.5 ppm \n\nValega et al., \n2008 \n\n   \n \n\nMitrena salt marsh, Sado, Portugal PAHs 7.35 Martins et al., \n2008 \n\nYangtze River intertidal zone, China Al 97213 \n\nZhang et al., \n2009 \n\n Fe 49627 \n\n Cd 0.750 \n\n Cr 173 \n\n Cu 49.7 \n\n Mn 1112 \n\n Ni 48 \n\n Pb 44.1 \n\n Zn 154 \n\nC\u00e1vado River estuary, Portugal PAHs 0.4023 Mucha et al., \n2011 \n\nLima River estuary, Portugal PAHs 800 Ribeiro et al., \n2011 \n\na PAHs: polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; PCBs: polychlorobiphenyls; DDT: dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane; \nHCB: hexachlorobenzene; HCH: hexachlorocyclohexane; Dieldrin:hexachlorodimethanonaphthalene. \nb Maximum concentration found in soil or sediments. \n\n \n\nHydrocarbons \n\nPetroleum hydrocarbons (PHs) are common environmental contaminants and \n\nrepresent a serious problem in many parts of the world (Gioia et al., 2006, Iqbal et al., \n\n2007, Labbe et al., 2007, Vazquez et al., 2009, Yergeau et al., 2009, Santos et al., \n\n2011), particularly in coastal and estuarine systems which may become seriously \n\naffected (Castle et al., 2006, Gomes et al., 2008, Beazley et al., 2012). They are the \n\nprincipal components in a range of commercial products (e.g., gasoline, fuel oils, \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n16 \n\n \n\nlubricating oils, solvents, mineral spirits, mineral oils, and crude oil). Petroleum \n\nproducts are a complex mixture of hundreds of hydrocarbon compounds, including \n\nvarious amounts of aliphatic and aromatic molecules. They enter and spread through the \n\nenvironment in many different ways (Todd et al., 1999). Certain petroleum \n\nhydrocarbons are directly released in the water column, forming surface films while \n\nothers tend to accumulate in the sediment.  \n\nPAHs are widespread in air, soil, sediment, surface water, groundwater, and runoff \n\nand are also found to accumulate in plants and aquatic organisms (Simpson et al., 1996, \n\nPeng et al., 2008, Haritash &amp; Kaushik, 2009). In estuarine environments, polycyclic \n\naromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are of great concern due to their potential for \n\nbioaccumulation, persistence, transport, toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity \n\n(Cerniglia, 1992, Samanta et al., 2002, Bamforth &amp; Singleton, 2005, Haritash &amp; \n\nKaushik, 2009). These compounds are introduced into estuarine environments from \n\ndifferent sources and by a variety of processes (Fig. 1.1). Although PAHs are ubiquitous \n\nin the environment (fossil fuels, brush fires, volcanoes, and burning natural vegetation), \n\nanthropogenic activities, such as petroleum refining and transport activities dependent \n\non the combustion of fossil fuels, are the major contributors to their release in the \n\nenvironment (Freeman &amp; Cattell, 1990, Cerniglia, 1992, Samanta et al., 2002, Bamforth \n\n&amp; Singleton, 2005).  \n\nPAHs are classified as low molecular weight (LMW) and high molecular weight \n\n(HMW) according to the number and type of rings they have in the structure (Bayoumi, \n\n2009). Based on their abundance and toxicity, 16 PAHs have been included in the list of \n\npriority pollutants of the US Soil Protection Agency (Liu et al., 2001). Because of their \n\nhigh hydrophobicity and low lability, the process of PAHs remediation, especially in \n\nsoils and sediments, is generally slow and expensive. The fate of PAHs in the \n\nenvironment depends on abiotic and biotic processes such as stabilization, landfarming \n\n(stimulation of indigenous microorganisms in the soil by providing nutrients, water, and \n\noxygen), steam and thermal heating, chemical oxidation, bioremediation \n\n(bioaugmentation and biostimulation), and phytoremediation, which have been applied \n\nto the restoration of groundwater and soils/sediments (Bamforth &amp; Singleton, 2005, \n\nWick et al., 2011). \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n17 \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 1.1 Sources and processes involved in hydrocarbon release into estuarine \n\necosystems. \n\n \n\nPhytoremediation of hydrocarbons \n\nHalophytes are defined as plants capable of completing their life cycle in salt \n\nconcentrations around 0.200M NaCl or even higher (Flowers &amp; Colmer, 2008). \n\nMoreover, many of these plants inhabit environments subject to constant flooding (e.g \n\ncoastal mangroves and salt marshes) (Colmer &amp; Flowers, 2008). Because estuaries and \n\ncoastal habitats are highly exposed to environmental contamination, many studies \n\naddressed the use of halophytes in the phytoremediation of many pollutants (e.g., heavy \n\nmetals, xenobiotics, and PHs) (Lin &amp; Mendelssohn, 2009, Couto et al., 2011, Liu et al., \n\n2011, Marques et al., 2011, Curado et al., 2014). The physiological mechanisms that \n\nthese plants use to tolerate salts are partly analogous to those involved in heavy metal \n\nresistance. Therefore, halophyte plants can accumulate metals, being therefore regarded \n\nas promising candidates for the removal or stabilization of heavy metals in polluted \n\nsoils (Manousaki &amp; Kalogerakis, 2011). \n\nAccording to the fate of the contaminant or to the mechanism by which plants \n\nremediate contamination, these approaches are referred to as phytoextraction, \n\nrhizofiltration, phytostabilization, phytovolatilization, phytodegradation or \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n18 \n\n \n\nrhizodegradation (EPA, 2000, Trapp &amp; Karlson, 2001). Phytoextraction refers to the \n\nuptake, translocation, and accumulation of contaminants in the soil by plant roots into \n\nabove-ground components of the plants. This technique involves the introduction of \n\nplants referred to as hyper-accumulators in polluted sites that after grown, are harvested. \n\nSo, phytoextraction involves the repeated cropping of plants in contaminated soil until \n\ncontaminant concentration decreases to acceptable levels. After harvesting, \n\ncontaminated biomass needs treatments prior to disposal that can pass to secure \n\nlandfills, incineration, or more recently thermo-chemical conversion processes \n\n(combustion, gasification, and pyrolysis) (Garbisu &amp; Alkorta, 2001). Rhizofiltration \n\ninvolves the absorption or adsorption of contaminants through roots or other plant parts \n\n(EPA, 2000, Trapp &amp; Karlson, 2001). In phytostabilization, plants reduce the \n\nbioavailability of contaminants immobilizing them in soil/sediment, reducing the \n\nmobility of contaminants and preventing migration to water or air (EPA, 2000, Trapp &amp; \n\nKarlson, 2001). For the removal of low molecular weight compounds from soil, \n\nphytovolatilization is used. In this technique, plants volatilize contaminants that are \n\nbiologically converting to gaseous species and releasing them through leaves via \n\nevapotranspiration processes (EPA, 2000, Trapp &amp; Karlson, 2001). Organic \n\ncontaminants such as petroleum, PAHs, BTEX, TNT, chlorinated solvents, and \n\npesticides are degraded only by plants (phytodegradation) or by microorganisms and \n\nplants, in a process denominated as rhizodegradation (Trapp &amp; Karlson, 2001). \n\nComparatively with application for the sequestration or removal of metals, studies \n\ninvolving halophytes for phytoremediation of PHs are still rather scarce. However, \n\nspecies of Spartina, Salicornia, Juncus, Halonemum, Halimione, and Scirpus have been \n\ntested for the remediation of hydrocarbons in wetlands with encouraging results (Table \n\n2). The ability for PAH bioaccumulation was described for Salicornia fragilis shoots by \n\na process of soil-to-plant transference that is dependent of exposure duration and \n\npollution degree. High molecular weight PAHs were detected in aerial parts of the plant \n\n(Meudec et al., 2006). In a study conducted in greenhouse conditions, the use of Juncus \n\nroemerianus transplanted to salt marsh sediment contaminated with different diesel oil \n\ndosages was tested. The results revealed the reduction of PHs in J. roemerianus \n\ntreatments, in relation to control sediments, suggesting that these plants may \n\nsimultaneously contribute to the restoration and remediation of diesel-contaminated \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n19 \n\n \n\nwetlands. Phytoremediation by J. roemerianus was even more effective for PAHs than \n\nfor n-alkanes (Lin &amp; Mendelssohn, 2009). In an outdoor laboratory experiment \n\n(microcosm-scale), the potential of the salt marsh plants Halimione portulacoides, \n\nScirpus maritimus, and Juncus maritimus for the remediation of soil contaminated with \n\nrefinery waste was tested. Two situations were tested: (i) the use of each individual \n\nplant species or the use of an association of two plants (S. maritimus and J. maritimus) \n\nand (ii) soil with old contamination (crude oil) or a mixture of the old and recent \n\n(turbine oil) contamination. Combined transplants of S. maritimus and H. portulacoides \n\nplants were efficient in removing not only all the recent and old contamination, and the \n\nprocess was faster and more efficient than natural attenuation (Couto et al., 2011).  \n\n \n\nTable 1.2 Halophytes used for phytoremediation of hydrocarbons in estuarine areas. \n\nPlant  Result Reference \n\nSpartina alterniflora and \nSpartina patens \n\nRestoration of oil contaminated wetlands and \naccelerated oil degradation in soil. \n\nLin &amp; \nMendelssohn, \n1998 \n\nSalicornia fragilis  \nIntense bioaccumulation of PAHs from oil-polluted \nsediments in the shoots. \n\nMeudec et al., \n2006 \n\nJuncus roemerianus Phytoremediation of diesel-contaminated wetlands. \nLin &amp; \nMendelssohn, \n2009 \n\nHalonemum strobilaceum \nPhytoremediation of oil-polluted hypersaline \nenvironments via rhizosphere technology. \n\nAl-Mailem et \nal., 2010 \n\nHalimione portulacoides, \nScirpus maritimus and \nJuncus maritimus  \n\nRemoval of petroleum hydrocarbons from soil. \nCouto et al., \n2011 \n\nScirpus triqueter Enhanced biodegradation of diesel pollutants. \nLiu et al., \n2011 \n\n \n\nDespite existing evidence that the halophytes can be used successfully for the \n\nphytoremediation of estuarine areas, such as oil- or diesel-polluted sites (Table 1.2), \n\nthere are still some limitations to the extensive use of this bioremediation approach. The \n\nefficiency of halophytes, as phytoremediation agents, depends on the plant species. For \n\nexample, a comparative study of the efficiency of the salt-marsh species H. \n\nportulacoides, S. maritimus, and J. maritimus for remediation of PHs revealed that the \n\nplant species is determinant in the rate of hydrocarbon clearance and, more importantly, \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n20 \n\n \n\nthat different associations between these plants can interfere with or even inhibit the \n\nprocess (Couto et al., 2011). \n\n \n\nMicrobial hydrocarbon degradation \n\nContrasting with the prospective character of the use halophytes, the use of \n\nmicroorganisms for the clearance of hydrocarbons in the environment has long been \n\nregarded with interest. Through microbial activity, hydrocarbons are converted into \n\ncarbon dioxide, water, and living biomass (Genouw et al., 1994). A diversity of \n\nbacteria, fungi and algae has been characterized as to their capacity to degrade PAHs \n\n(Haritash &amp; Kaushik, 2009). \n\nMicroorganisms have been found to degrade PAHs via different catabolic pathways, \n\nsuch as anaerobic or aerobic metabolism, or co-metabolism which is important for the \n\ndegradation of mixtures of PAHs and high molecular weight PAHs (Habe &amp; Omori, \n\n2003, Zhong et al., 2007, Peng et al., 2008). The initial step in aerobic metabolism of \n\nPAHs usually occurs via the incorporation of oxygen into aromatic rings followed by \n\nthe systematic breakdown of the compound to PAHs metabolites and/or carbon dioxide. \n\nAnaerobic metabolism occurs via hydrogenation of aromatic rings (Bamforth &amp; \n\nSingleton, 2005, Zhong et al., 2007). In co-metabolism, the range and extent of high \n\nmolecular weight PAH degradation is influenced by an important interaction that \n\ntransforms the non-growth substrate (PAHs) in the presence of growth substrates \n\n(Zhong et al., 2007).  \n\nPhysicochemical factors, such as soil type and structure, pH, temperature, electron \n\nacceptors, and nutrients, will affect microbial activity and determine the persistence of \n\nhydrocarbons (such PAHs) in polluted environments (Table 1.3). In estuarine areas, \n\nsuch as salt marshes, salinity fluctuations represent one of major challenges for \n\nhydrocarbon degradation that may even compromise the overall success of the process. \n\nThere is an inverse relation between salinity and hydrocarbon solubility, with the \n\nconsequent inhibitory effect of salinity on hydrocarbon bioremediation (Mille et al., \n\n1991). However, successful hydrocarbon degradation has been reported over a wide \n\nrange of salinity values. A consortium of bacteria isolated from oil-contaminated \n\nsediments demonstrated the highest rate of hydrocarbon degradation with a salinity of \n\n0.4M NaCl and the degradation was attenuated below and above this limit (Bertrand et \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n21 \n\n \n\nal., 1993). In a study with two bacterial consortia isolated from crude oil and mangrove \n\nsediments, the highest rate of degradation of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons \n\noccurred in a salinity range between 0-0.171M, and decreased with increasing salinity \n\n(Beeson et al., 2002).  \n\n \n\nTable 1.3 Factors affecting the biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons. \n\n \n\nRiis et al., (2003) reported diesel fuel degradation by microbial communities from \n\nsaline soils in Patagonia up to a salinity of 2.997M. Although hydrocarbon \n\ncontamination is still persistent and recalcitrant in its nature, the fact that microbes from \n\nvegetated saline sediments can still actively degrade hydrocarbons in the presence of \n\nvariable and relatively high concentrations of salt opens promising perspectives for \n\nmicrobe-assisted phytoremediation in estuarine areas. \n\n \n\nFactor Effect Reference \n\nBioavailability \nComposition and concentration of hydrocarbons affect \nthe rate and extent of biodegradation. \n\nVenosa &amp; Zhu, 2003, Peng \net al., 2008, Das &amp; \nChandran, 2010 \n\nTemperature \nAffects the physicochemical behavior of hydrocarbons \n(viscosity, diffusion, solubility). \n\nVenosa &amp; Zhu, 2003, \nCoulon et al., 2007, Peng et \nal., 2008, Das &amp; Chandran, \n2010  \n\n \nAffects the physiology and diversity of \nmicroorganisms. \n\npH \nInhibits microbial activity by regulating microbial \nmetabolism. \n\nVenosa &amp; Zhu, 2003, \nAislabie et al., 2006, Peng \net al., 2008) \n\nNutrients \nAvailability of limiting nutrients (N, P, K, Fe) affects \nmicrobial growth and consequently biodegradation \nrates. \n\nVenosa &amp; Zhu, 2003, \nKaakinen et al., 2007, Peng \net al., 2008, Das &amp; \nChandran, 2010 \n\nOxygen \nDespite the occurrence of biodegradation of \nhydrocarbons in anaerobic and aerobic conditions, \noxygen depletion decreases biodegradation rates. \n\nVenosa &amp; Zhu, 2003, Peng \net al., 2008, Haritash &amp; \nKaushik, 2009 \n\nSalinity \nChanges in salinity promote alteration of the microbial \npopulation that affects biodegradation rates.

So, microbe-assisted phytoremediation represents a \n\npowerful emerging approach to sequester, degrade, transform, assimilate, metabolize, or \n\ndetoxify contaminants from soil, sediment, or groundwater (EPA, 2000, Moreira et al., \n\n2006). \n\nNumerous bacteria found in association with plants are capable of degrading \n\nhydrocarbons, namely PAHs, suggesting that indigenous rhizobacteria and endophytic \n\nbacteria may have potential for bioremediation of polluted sites (Segura et al., 2009). In \n\nthe particular case of estuarine environments, a diversity of hydrocarbon-degrading \n\nmicrobial populations has been found in association with the rhizosphere of salt marsh \n\nplants, where they actively contribute to hydrocarbon removal and degradation (Daane \n\net al., 2001, Ribeiro et al., 2011). The use of rhizosphere and phyllosphere (aerial \n\nportion of plants) of the halophyte Halonemum strobilaceum was also proposed for \n\nphytoremediation of oil-polluted hypersaline environments, via rhizosphere technology \n\n(Al-Mailem et al., 2010). \n\nRhizodegradation appears to be a particularly interesting phytoremediation process \n\nfor the removal and/or degradation of organic contaminants, such as PH. The \n\nrhizosphere is defined as the zone directly influenced by the plant root system. Plants \n\nprovide root exudates rich in carbon sources, nutrients, enzymes, and sometimes \n\noxygen, creating a favorable environment in which microbial activity is stimulated \n\n(Cunningham et al., 1996, Frick et al., 1999, Kuiper et al., 2004). However, microbial \n\ninteractions with plants are not limited to the rhizosphere; rather, they extend to the \n\ninterior of the plant (Lodewyckx et al., 2002). Endophytic-assisted phytoremediation, \n\ninvolving microorganisms that are capable of living within various plant tissues (roots, \n\nstems, and leaves), has been reported in recent years as successful in the degradation of \n\nsome pollutants, such as explosives, herbicides, and hydrocarbons (Germaine et al., \n\n2006, Phillips et al., 2008, Segura et al., 2009). In fact remediation of hydrocarbons by \n\ncombined use of plants and rhizobacteria and/or endophytic bacteria have been widely \n\ndescribed (Table 1.4).  \n\nGenetically engineered endophyte microorganisms enhance the overall health of \n\ntheirs hosts (Barac et al., 2004) and may indirectly improve biodegradation of \n\ncontaminants in the rhizosphere. Experiments in which pea plants were inoculated with \n\nthe naphthalene degrader Pseudomonas putida VM1441 (pNAH7) and exposed to \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n24 \n\n \n\nnaphthalene contamination revealed that naphthalene degradation rate (~ 40%), seed \n\ngermination, and plant transpiration were enhanced in inoculated plants than in non-\n\ninoculated controls. Moreover, inoculation resulted in an overall protection of the host \n\nplants from the phytotoxic effects of naphthalene (Germaine et al., 2009). A study \n\ncarried out in a mangrove showed that nursery conditions and early microbial \n\ncolonization patterns had long-term effect on the rhizosphere of transplanted \n\nmangroves. This phenomenon may have potential application for introducing new \n\nrhizocompetent bacteria carrying genes or plasmids to improve plant growth or \n\nbioremediation (rhizoengineering) (Gomes et al., 2010b). \n\nSeveral studies reported the enhancement of PH degradation in association with the \n\npresence of bacteria carrying PH degradation genes (Table 1.4). A high diversity of \n\nhydrocarbon degradative genes, such as alkane monooxygenase (alkB), naphthalene \n\ndioxygenase (ndoB), phenanthrene dioxygenase (phnAc), and cytochrome P450 alkane \n\nhydroxylase, has been detected in plant microhabitats (rhizosphere and endosphere) \n\n(Phillips et al., 2006, Phillips et al., 2008, Germaine et al., 2009). In fact, the \n\nmonitoring of gene abundance and expression during phytoremedition of contaminated \n\nsites can give indications about the persistence and functional activity of inoculated \n\nmicroorganisms (Juhanson et al., 2009). A study conducted at a long-term \n\nphytoremediation field site revealed that both rhizosphere and endophytic communities \n\nshowed substantial inter-species variation in hydrocarbon degradation potential and \n\nactivity levels, with an increase in catabolic genotypes in specific plant treatments \n\n(Phillips et al., 2008). \n\nRecently, it was suggested that for certain phytoremedition approaches, it may be \n\nessential or at least important, that bacteria also act as plant growth promoters, in \n\naddition to their pollutant-degrading activity. In experiments with Italian ryegrass, plant \n\nbiomass production and alkane degradation were significantly enhanced by inoculation \n\nwith bacterial strains expressing hydrocarbon-degrading genes (e.g. alkB) as well as \n\nplant-promoting activity (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase \n\nactivity) (Yousaf et al., 2011, Afzal et al., 2012). So, the combined use of plant and \n\nbacteria can be exploited to relieve plant stress, and enhance bioremediation of PH-\n\ncontaminated sites. \n\n\n\nIn\ntro\n\nd\nu\n\nctio\nn\n\n \n\n2\n5 \n\n \n\nTable 1.4 Examples of successful approaches of remediation of hydrocarbons by combined use of plants and rhizobacteria and/or endophytic \nbacteria. \n\nReference \n\nSheng  &amp;  \nGong, 2006 \n\nPhillips  et al., \n2006 \n\nGermaine et \nal., 2009 \n\nGurska et al., \n2009 \n\nMuratova et \nal., 2010 \n\nYousaf et al., \n2010a \n\nHong et al., \n2011 \n\nAfzal et al., \n2012 \n\nLiu et al., \n2013 \n\na   alkB: alkane monooxygenase; , ndoB: naphthalene dioxygenase; nidA: naphthalene inducible dioxygenase; phnAc: phenanthrene dioxygenase; C2,3O: catechol 2,3 dioxygenase; nah: encoded same proteins for both upper and lower \npathway of naphthalene degradation. \nb ACC: 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase activity; IAA: indole-3-acetic acid. \nc Maximum degradation obtain ed from sediments or soils in each study. \nd Hydrocarbon contaminated site located  in south-eastern Saskatchewan, Canada (approx. 3000 to 3500 ug/g). \n\nPercen. \nDegradationc \n\n84.8% in 80 \ndays \n\n50% in 4.5 \nmonths \n\n40% in 14 days \n\n65%  in 3 years \n\napprox. 70 % in \n120 days \n\n> 57%  in 90 \ndays \n\n96 % in 46 days \n\napprox. 79 % in \n93 days \n\n85% in 120 \ndays \n\nType  of \ncontaminant \n\nPhenanthrene \n\nMixture of \nhydrocarbonsd \n\nNaphthalene \n\nOil refinery \n\nOil sludge \n\nDiesel fuel \n\nDiesel fuel \n\nDiesel fuel \n\nOil \n\nPlant-growth promotion \nfeaturesb \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nACC deaminase, \nsiderophores  and  IAA \nproducing strain   \n\nIAA producing strain \n\n \n\nACC deaminase and \nsiderophores \n\nACC deaminase \nproducing strain \n\nACC deaminase, \nsiderophores  and  IAA \nproducing strain   \n\nGene(s)a \n\nunknown phenanthrene \ndegradation gene \n\nalkB, ndoB, nidA, phnAc and \nC2,3O \n\nnah (plasmid NAH7) \n\n \n\n \n\nunknown  alkane degradation \ngene; cytochrome P450 alkane \nhydroxylase and alkB gene \n\n \n\nunknown  alkane degradation \ngene; cytochrome P450 alkane \nhydroxylase and alkB gene \n\n \n\nPlant \n\nTriticum aestivum \n\nFestuca rubra \n\nLolium multiflorum \n\nLolium perenne, Festuca \narundinacea, and Secale \ncereale \n\nSecale cereale and \nMedicago sativa \n\nLolium multiflorum and \nLolium corniculatus \n\nZea mays \n\nLolium multiflorum \n\nTestuca arundinacea \n\nRhizobacteria  or \nendophytic bacteria \n\nPseudomonas sp.

SB \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n26 \n\n \n\nCurrent limitations to the microbe-assisted phytoremediation of hydrocarbons \n\nMicrobe-assisted phytoremediation has been broadly tested for the degradation or \n\nsequestration of hydrocarbons in estuarine environments. Despite being considered an \n\ninexpensive, sustainable and environment-friendly technique, phytoremediation is not \n\nexempt of controversy, and the success of this type of approach is significantly affected \n\nby environmental factors and particular features of each ecosystem. One major \n\nlimitation is time, considering that successful phytoremediation is a process that goes on \n\nfor long periods which is partially determined by the slow growth and phenological (or \n\nlife) cycle of plants, the limited depth of the root system, and the fact that many plant \n\nspecies are sensitive to the contaminants that are being remediated (Kuiper et al., 2004, \n\nPilon-Smits, 2005).  \n\nThe bioavailability of petroleum hydrocarbons is another important factor in the \n\nsuccess of bioremediation, and it can be significantly affected by soil type and organic \n\nmatter content. Water content (affects the availability of oxygen required for aerobic \n\nrespiration), temperature, and nutrient availability (influences the rate and extent of \n\nbiodegradation) are relevant determinants of the efficiency of the PHs bioremediation \n\nprocess (Frick et al., 1999). The competition for nutrients between plants and \n\nmicroorganisms can be a restriction to the remediation efficiency. A reduction in \n\nmicrobial abundance and an attenuation of degradation of higher molecular weight \n\nPAHs in sediments was observed in H. portulacoides banks and this effect was \n\nassociated to nutrient limitation (Mucha et al., 2011). Therefore, fertilization may be \n\nrequired for optimal rhizoremediation of hydrocarbons. \n\nAlthough a wide range of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria have been isolated from \n\ncontaminated environments, little is known about the stability of the association with \n\nsalt marsh plants and the success of the re-introduction of plant-bacteria systems for \n\npotential phytoremediation processes in saline sediments. The fact that these biotopes \n\nare colonized in a particular type of plants, well adapted to flooding and to salinity \n\nfluctuations, reinforces the need to incorporate basic knowledge on their interaction \n\nwith sediment microbes in the design of phytoremediation approaches. The ability to \n\nmonitor the survival and efficiency of hydrocarbon degradation of inoculated strains is \n\nessential for the in-depth understanding of the network of relations established between \n\nsediments, plants, and microbes that underlies microbe-assisted phytoremediation. \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n27 \n\n \n\nMonitoring plant-bacteria interactions involved in microbe-assisted \n\nphytoremediation  \n\nThe efficient colonization of plants by microbial pollutant degraders is an essential \n\ncontribution for plant survival and hydrocarbon degradation (Andria et al., 2009, Afzal \n\net al., 2012). Despite the lack of knowledge on inoculation and bacterial colonization of \n\nhalophyte plants, the monitoring of plant-bacteria interaction in hydrocarbon-polluted \n\nsites has been addressed by different approaches. In bioremediation, the use of culture-\n\ndependent methodologies, such as dilution plating on agar plates containing antibiotics, \n\nthe most-probable-number (MPN) method, and direct counting, are insufficient for an \n\naccurate and sensitive monitoring of the inoculation and colonization processes \n\n(Schneegurt &amp; Kulpa, 1998). Molecular techniques including polymerase chain reaction \n\n(PCR), real-time PCR, and DNA hybridization, reporter genes or genetically marker \n\nmicroorganisms (biomarkers) have been used to check on microbe survival, efficiency \n\nof colonization, and activity (Germaine et al., 2004, Ryan et al., 2008, Andria et al., \n\n2009, Juhanson et al., 2009, Segura et al., 2009). For example, antibiotic resistance and \n\ngreen fluorescent protein (gfp) genes have been proposed as useful tools for monitoring \n\nthe colonization of bacterial endophytes, inoculated in poplar trees (Afzal et al., 2013). \n\nEndophyte colonization has also been monitored with the use of gusA marker gene \n\nencoding the enzyme ?-glucuronidase. A gus-marked strain, Burkholderia phytofirmans \n\nPsJN, was inoculated in seeds of ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.). B. phytofirmans \n\nPsJN:gusA10 revealed that this bacterium has the ability to colonize the rhizosphere and \n\nendosphere of ryegrass vegetation in a diesel-contaminated soil and generally improved \n\nplant biomass production and hydrocarbon degradation (Afzal et al., 2013). Other study, \n\nusing restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), showed that Enterobacter \n\nludwigii strains were able to efficiently colonize the rhizosphere and endosphere of \n\nItalian ryegrass, birdsfoot trefoil, and alfalfa. Moreover, E. ludwigii strains contain a \n\ncytochrome P450-type alkane hydroxylase (CYP153), and the quantification and \n\nexpression of these genes by real-time PCR indicate an active role in hydrocarbon \n\ndegradation, in the rhizosphere and endosphere of all three plant species (Yousaf et al., \n\n2011). Quantitative PCR has emerged as a useful and rapid tool for monitoring \n\ncatabolic genes during bioremediation processes. As an example, this technique was \n\nused for the assessment of hydrocarbon degradation activity of Nocardia sp. H17-1 \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n28 \n\n \n\nduring remediation of crude-contaminated soil (Baek et al., 2009). A similar approach \n\nwas used to demonstrate that hydrocarbon degradation was associated with functional \n\nchanges in microbial communities, in which high copy numbers of catechol 2,3- \n\ndioxygenase and naphthalene dioxygenase correlated with PAH mineralization (Phillips \n\net al., 2012). \n\nMetagenomic pyrosequencing, which allows the recovery of a very large number of \n\nmicrobial sequences directly from environmental samples, has more recently emerged \n\nas a powerful technique to follow plant-microbe interactions during the bioremediation \n\nprocess (Roesch et al., 2007, Wang et al., 2012). The sequences obtained can be \n\ncompared with reference libraries, and then taxa present in an environmental sample can \n\nbe identified with high confidence. The massive data sets generated provide information \n\nthat can be used for a variety of applications, such as the comprehensive understanding \n\nof within-site and between-site variability of microbial communities and the impact of \n\nthis variability in ecosystem-scale processes in salt marshes (Bowen et al., 2012). The \n\npyrosequencing analysis of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene fragments \n\nof different Phragmites australis rhizospheres revealed a trend in the variation of \n\nbacterial community structure during wetland degradation and identified sulfur and \n\nsulfate-reducing bacteria, nitrifying and nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and methane-oxidizing \n\nbacteria as crucial in the protection and ecological restoration of wetlands (Zhang et al., \n\n2013). Recent bioremediation studies have used pyrosequencing analysis of bacterial \n\n16S rRNA genes to describe microbial community dynamics in hydrocarbon-\n\ncontaminated sites thus providing basis for the development of strategies for monitoring \n\nremediation processes (Singleton et al., 2011, Sutton et al., 2013). For example, the \n\nrelative abundance of Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, and Euryarchaeota was directly \n\ncorrelated with the presence of diesel (Sutton et al., 2013).  \n\n \n\nFuture perspectives \n\nDespite numerous limitations, phytoremediation and particularly, microbe-assisted \n\nphytoremediation have undeniable advantages, and research must now specifically \n\naddress the aspects that can allow the scaling up from laboratory to the field for the \n\npractical implementation of this approach. \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n29 \n\n \n\nEach salt marsh displays particularly biological, chemical, and physical \n\ncharacteristics that will ultimately determine the success of phytoremediation. \n\nTherefore, field studies, combined with laboratory approaches, are required for the \n\nunderstanding of the interplay of biological and chemical processes involved in \n\nmicrobe-assisted phytoremediation of oil-impacted sites. \n\nConsidering that plant-microbe interactions play a key role in the process of \n\nenvironment and in planta detoxification, (a) the identification of autochthonous \n\nhydrocarbon-degrading bacterial populations associated to salt marsh plants \n\n(rhizosphere and aboveground plant tissues), (b) the identification of degradative \n\nplasmids, and (c) the selection of petroleum-resistant plants are key issues for the \n\nsuccess of environmental restoration. The detection of genes related to hydrocarbon \n\ndegradation pathways in halophyte plants can be useful to screen for lineages of plants \n\nthat can be used in efficient phytoremediation protocols. Moreover, these genes can be \n\nused for the genetic engineered design of plants for novel phytoremediation approaches \n\nfor hydrocarbon-polluted wetlands and soils (RamanaRao et al., 2012). Recent plant \n\nbiotechnology approaches involving the introduction of specialized bacterial \n\nendophytes in plants or the design of genetically engineered plants containing \n\ninteresting bacterial genes (Barac et al., 2004, Taghavi et al., 2005) create new \n\nperspectives for future phytoremedition protocols. Endophytic hydrocarbon-degrading \n\nbacteria may have a growth-promoting effect on the wild salt marsh halophyte plants \n\nand may be regarded as promising when field microbe-assisted phytoremediation \n\napproaches are envisaged. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThis work was supported by the Centre for Environmental and Marine Studies, \n\nUniversity of Aveiro (CESAM, project Pest C/MAR/LA0017/2011).

Both DGGE and pyrosequencing revealed that bacterial \n\ncomposition is structured by microhabitat. Rhizosphere sediment from both plant \n\nspecies revealed enrichment of OTUs (operational taxonomic units) closely related to \n\nAcidimicrobiales, Myxococcales and Sphingomonadales. The in silico metagenome \n\nanalyses suggest that homologue genes related to OH degradation appeared to be more \n\nfrequent in both plant rhizospheres than in bulk sediment.  \n\nIn summary, this study suggests that halophyte plant colonization is an important \n\ndriver of hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial community composition in estuarine \n\nenvironments, which can be exploited for in situ phytoremediation of OH in salt marsh \n\nenvironments. \n\n \n\nKeywords: rhizosphere, pyrosequencing, microbial diversity, salt marshes  \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\nEstuarine salt marshes are ecologically, commercially and economically important \n\n(Barbier et al., 2011). Due to their high productivity and location, they provide valuable \n\necosystem services (Coulon et al., 2012). However, being located between aquatic and \n\nterrestrial systems, they are vulnerable to perturbations from both environments (Bowen \n\net al., 2012). Although salt marsh conservation is generally believed to be important for \n\n\n\nBacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed \n\n32 \n\n \n\nthe maintenance of healthy coastal ecosystems, these ecosystems have been \n\nsystematically destroyed due to urban and industrial growth (Reboreda &amp; Ca\u00e7ador, \n\n2007; Martins et al., 2008). Anthropogenic inputs of hydrocarbons are one of the major \n\nthreats to salt marsh vegetation (Carman et al., 1996; Watts et al., 2006; Martins et al., \n\n2008). Low molecular weight aromatic hydrocarbons are particularly deleterious and \n\ncan affect plants during all growth stages (Gao &amp; Zhu, 2004; Watts et al., 2006; Watts \n\net al., 2008). \n\nMicrobial degradation is the primary route for the breakdown of hydrocarbons; \n\ndegradation depends largely on composition and adaptive response to the presence of \n\nhydrocarbons (Leahy &amp; Colwell, 1990). The use of plants and their associated \n\nmicroorganisms to promote bioremediation of degraded areas has been previously \n\ndemonstrated in several studies (Siciliano &amp; Germida, 1998; Daane et al., 2001). \n\nRhizosphere-associated microorganisms are currently regarded as pivotal in combating \n\nenvironmental contamination and there is growing interest in the development of new \n\napproaches for the mitigation of hydrocarbon contamination of coastal ecosystems \n\n(Daane et al., 2001; Ribeiro e et al., 2011). Although information exists regarding the \n\nmicrobial processes involved in hydrocarbon degradation (McGenity, 2014) many \n\nothers questions, such as the organization of microbial community structure or even the \n\nmechanism involved in their adaptation to the presence of oil contamination, need \n\nadditional data to implement appropriate bioremediation strategies. Molecular \n\ntechniques provide an opportunity to understand microbial diversity and functionality in \n\noil contaminated sites. \n\nIn a previous study, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to determine \n\nthe relationship between different halophyte species and the relative abundance of \n\nprokaryote groups in salt marsh sediments and a metabolomics analysis revealed that \n\nvolatile compounds released through the roots may underlie plant-bacteria associations \n\nin intertidal salt marshes (Oliveira et al., 2012). Here we provide, for the first time, a \n\nthorough in-depth molecular characterization of bacterial communities in bulk sediment \n\nand rhizosphere microhabitats in a temperate estuary (Ria de Aveiro, Portugal) \n\nchronically exposed to oil hydrocarbon (OH) pollution. DGGE and barcoded \n\npyrosequencing (16S rRNA gene amplicons) were used to assess how plant species- and \n\nOH pollution affect sediment bacterial composition in sampling sites exposed to \n\n\n\nBacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed \n\n33 \n\n \n\nFig. 2.1 Ria de Aveiro (Portugal) with the \n\nlocation of sampling stations (A, B, C or D).   \n\ndifferent levels of contamination. In addition to this, the 16S rRNA gene sequences \n\nretrieved in this study were used to generate in silico metagenomes and evaluate the \n\ndistribution of potential bacterial traits in different microhabitats. \n\n \n\nMaterial and methods \n\nSampling sites and sample processing \n\nSamples were obtained from four sites of the Ria de Aveiro estuarine system \n\n(Aveiro, Portugal). The Ria de Aveiro is a shallow estuary, sometimes considered a \n\ncoastal lagoon, on the northwest cost of Portugal (40.7\u00b0 N, 8.7\u00b0 W). It is formed by a \n\ncomplex network of channels and extensive intertidal zones (Dias et al., 1999). Plant \n\nand sediment samples were taken during low tide, from four different sites (site A, \n\n40?35\u00b452.64\u00b4\u00b4N, 8?45\u00b4.0071\u00b4\u00b4W; site B, 40?38\u00b427.42\u00b4\u00b4N, 8?44\u00b415.42\u00b4\u00b4W; site C, \n\n40?37\u00b432.18\u00b4\u00b4N, 8?44\u00b409.12\u00b4\u00b4W; site D, 40?37\u00b418.90\u00b4\u00b4N, 8?39\u00b446.28\u00b4\u00b4W (Fig. 2.1). In \n\neach site, four composite samples of \n\neach plant species (Halimione \n\nportulacoides and Sarcocornia \n\nperennis subsp. perennis) were \n\ncollected and stored separately in \n\nplastic bags for transportation. In the \n\nlaboratory, bulk sediment and \n\nrhizosphere samples were separated. \n\nRoots were manually shaken to remove \n\nloosely bound sediment, which was \n\ndiscarded. The rhizosphere was \n\nextracted by suspending roots with \n\ntightly attached sediment particles in \n\nsterile deionized water. The mixture \n\nwas kept in a rotary shaker for 30 \n\nmin. and the resulting sediment slurry \n\nwas decanted into a sterile Falcon tube and centrifuged (5 min., 7600 rpm, 4\u00baC). The \n\nsupernatant was rejected (Phillips et al., 2008). Bulk sediment and rhizosphere extracts \n\n\n\nBacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed \n\n34 \n\n \n\nwere stored at -20\u00baC for subsequent molecular analysis. For salt marsh physicochemical \n\ncharacterization, three sediment subsamples were collected in each sampling site. \n\n \n\nSediments properties  \n\nFor pH determination (Orion Model 290A), bulk sediment was suspended in water \n\n[1:5 (w/v)] (Faoun, 1984). Sub-samples were analyzed for organic matter content, as \n\npercentage of weight loss by ignition (8 h at 450 \u00b0C), moisture (expressed in percentage \n\nof water per quantity of fresh sediment weight) and sediment grain size (estimated from \n\nwet and dry sieving), following Quintino et al. (1989).  \n\n \n\nHydrocarbon analysis  \n\nBulk sediment was analyzed for aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons after a Soxhlet \n\nextraction followed by a gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, \n\nconducted for three sediment sub-samples of each site that were previously \n\nhomogenized and freeze-dried. For the standardization of the procedure, the internal \n\ncalibration method was used in the quantification of 16 US EPA priority PAHs. \n\nDeuterated PAH surrogate standards were added to sediment samples in order to \n\ncalculate the recovery efficiency during sample extraction, cleanup and analysis. For the \n\naliphatic hydrocarbons fraction, two internal standards were used: undecane (C11H24) \n\nand tetracosane (C24H50). \n\nFive grams of dried, homogenized sediment were extracted for 24 h in a Soxhlet \n\napparatus with 150 mL of dichloromethane. Prior to extraction, the sediment was spiked \n\nwith 25 \u00b5 l (2 \u00b5 g ml-1) deuterated surrogate standards (naphthalene-d8, acenapthlene-d10, \n\nphenanthrene-d10, chrysene-d12 and perylene-d12). Activated copper (Schubert, 1998) \n\nwas added to the collection flask to avoid sulfur interferences in gas chromatography-\n\nmass spectrometry. The extracts were concentrated by rotary evaporation up to a \n\nvolume of about 2-3 ml. The solvent was changed to 10 ml of hexane and the volume \n\nwas further reduced to approximately 1-2 ml. Hydrocarbons in the concentrated hexane \n\nextract were separated using a 2:1 alumina/silica gel column with anhydrous sodium \n\nsulfate overlaying the alumina in order to remove water. The column was used to clean-\n\nup and fractionate the extract. Elution was performed using 15 ml of hexane to obtain \n\nthe first fraction (aliphatic hydrocarbons), followed by an elution with 30 ml of \n\n\n\nBacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed \n\n35 \n\n \n\ndicloromethane/hexane (1:1). These two eluents containing the aromatic hydrocarbons \n\n(PAH) were combined for analysis. The sample volume was reduced to 1 ml by rotary \n\nvacuum evaporator and further to 0.2 ml with a gentle pure nitrogen stream. A known \n\nquantity (2 mg ml-1) of the internal standard, hexamethylbenzene, was added prior to \n\nGC-MS.  \n\nGC-MS analyses were conducted in an Agilent Network GC system, namely an \n\nAgilent 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a mass selective detector (MSD 5973). \n\nThe selective ion mode (SIM) was used for aromatic hydrocarbons and the scan mode \n\nwas used for aliphatic hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbons were separated using a VF-5MS \n\nfused silica column (30 m x 0.25 mm i.d. and 0.25 \u00b5m film thickness). GC/MS \n\noperating conditions were as follows: injector and transfer-line temperatures were \n\nmaintained at 300 \u00baC. The oven temperature program was initially isothermal at 60 \u00baC \n\nfor 1 min, increased to 200 \u00baC at a rate of 10 \u00baC/min (hold for 2 min), and then increased \n\nat a rate of 5 \u00baC/min (hold 8 min) and kept isothermal at 300 \u00baC. Helium was used as \n\ncarrier gas, at a flow rate of 1.3 ml min-1. Aliquots of 1 \u00b5l were manually injected in the \n\nsplitless mode with a 7.50 min solvent delay. For aromatic hydrocarbons, mass spectra \n\nwere acquired at the electron impact (EI) mode at 70 eV. The mass scanning ranged \n\nbetween m/? 20 and m/? 500. \n\nThe surrogate recoveries added to sediment samples were 78 \u00b1 18 % for \n\nnaphthalene-d8, 91 \u00b1 19 % for acenaphthene-d10, 114 \u00b1 25 % for phenanthrene-d10, 109 \n\n\u00b1 24 % for chrysene-d12 and 120 \u00b1 20 % for perylene-d10. \n\n \n\nTotal community DNA extraction \n\nTotal community DNA (TC-DNA) was extracted from bulk sediment and \n\nrhizosphere samples (0.5 g) with the MoBio UltracleanTM soil DNA kit (Cambio) \n\nfollowing manufacturer's instructions.  \n\n \n\nPCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene fragments and denaturing gradient gel \n\nelectrophoresis (DGGE) \n\nA nested PCR approach was used to amplify the 16S rRNA gene sequences from \n\nbulk and rhizosphere sediment (Gomes et al., 2008), which was more efficient for \n\namplification of 16S rRNA gene fragments from sediment suitable for DGGE analyses. \n\n\n\nBacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed \n\n36 \n\n \n\nBriefly, in the first PCR the universal bacterial primers U27 and 1492R (Weisburg et \n\nal., 1991) were used. Reaction mixtures (25 \u00b5 L) contained 12.5 \u00b5l DreamTaq\u2122 PCR \n\nMaster Mix (Fisher Scientific), 0.1 \u00b5 M of each primer, 80 \u00b5 g ml-1 bovine serum \n\nalbumin (BSA) and 1 \u00b5 l of template DNA. The amplification conditions were as \n\nfollows: 5 min of denaturation at 94 \u00baC, 25 cycles of 45 s at 94 \u00b0C, 45 s at 56 \u00b0C, and \n\n1.5 min at 72 \u00b0C; the PCR was finished by an extension step at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. The \n\namplicons obtained were used as template for a second PCR with the bacterial DGGE \n\nprimers 984F-GC and 1378R (Heuer et al., 1997). The PCR reaction mixtures (25 \u00b5 l) \n\nconsisted of 12.5 \u00b5l DreamTaq\u2122 PCR Master Mix (Fisher Scientific), 0.1 \u00b5 M of each \n\nprimer, 1 % (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 1 \u00b5l of template DNA. PCR \n\namplification conditions: initial denaturation (94 \u00baC for 4 min); 30 cycles of \n\ndenaturation (95 \u00baC for 1 min), annealing (53 \u00baC for 1 min), and extension (72 \u00baC for 1.5 \n\nmin) and a final extension (72 \u00baC for 7 min). The GC-clamped amplicons were applied \n\nto a double-gradient polyacrylamide gel containing 6-10% acrylamide with a gradient of \n\n40-58% of denaturants. The run was performed in Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer at 60 \u00b0C at \n\na constant voltage of 80 V for 16 h using the DCode System (Universal Mutation \n\nDetection System, Bio-Rad). The DGGE gels were silver stained (Heuer et al., 2001). \n\nThe processing of the scanned DGGE gels was carried out using Bionumerics software \n\n6.6 (Applied Maths). \n\n \n\nBarcoded-pyrosequencing  \n\nA barcoded pyrosequencing approach was used for the analysis of bacterial \n\ncommunities in bulk and rhizosphere sediments. Composite samples (four subsamples) \n\nof bulk or rhizosphere sediments from each sampling site were used for pyrosequencing \n\nanalysis. Fragments of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene were sequenced \n\nfor each sample with primers V3 Forward (5?-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAG-3?) and V4 \n\nReverse (5?-TACNVRRGTHTCTAATYC-3?) (Wang &amp; Qian, 2009), 1x Advantage 2 \n\nPolymerase Mix (Clontech), 1x Advantage 2 PCR Buffer, 0.2 \u00b5M of each PCR primer, \n\n0.2 mM dNTPs (Bioron), 5% DMSO (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) and 2 \u00b5l of genomic \n\nDNA template in a total volume of 25 \u00b5 l. The PCR conditions were as follows: 4 min \n\ndenaturation at 94?C, followed by 25 cycles of 94?C for 30 s, 44?C for 45 s and 68?C \n\nfor 60 s and a final extension at 68?C for 10 min. Negative controls were included for \n\n\n\nBacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed \n\n37 \n\n \n\nall amplification reactions. Electrophoresis of duplicate PCR products was undertaken \n\non a 1% (w/v) agarose gel and the 470 bp amplified fragments were purified using \n\nAMPure XP beads (Agencourt) or, if more than the expected fragment was amplified, \n\ngel purified using High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH), \n\naccording to manufacturer's instructions. The amplicons were quantified by fluorometry \n\nwith PicoGreen dsDNA quantitation kit (Invitrogen, Life Technologies), pooled at \n\nequimolar concentrations and sequenced in the A direction with GS 454 FLX Titanium \n\nchemistry, according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Roche, 454 Life Sciences) at \n\nBiocant (Cantanhede, Portugal). Sequences generated in this study can be downloaded \n\nfrom the NCBI Short Read Archive (Study accession: SRP035868). Analysis of the \n\npyrosequencing data was performed using previously described methods (Pires et al., \n\n2012; Cleary et al., 2013; Pol\u00f3nia et al., 2014 - see supplementary methods for a \n\ndetailed description).  \n\n \n\nData analysis \n\nTwo square matrices were imported into R (R Core Team, 2013) using the \n\nread.table() function: 1) containing the presence and raw abundance of all OTUs per \n\nsample generated with Qiime and 2) containing band 'abundance' based on band \n\nintensity and position of the DGGE gel. In the OTU abundance matrix, sequences not \n\nclassified as bacteria or classified as chloroplasts or mitochondria were removed prior to \n\nstatistical analysis. Both matrices were log10 (x+1) transformed and a distance matrix \n\nwas constructed using the Bray-Curtis index with the vegdist() function, in the vegan \n\npackage (Oksanen et al., 2011) in R. The Bray-Curtis index is one of the most \n\nfrequently applied (dis)similarity indices used in ecology (Legendre &amp; Gallagher, 2001; \n\nCleary, 2003; Cleary et al., 2013). Variation in OTU composition among microhabitats \n\nwas assessed with Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCO) using the cmdscale() function \n\nin R with the Bray-Curtis distance matrix as input. We tested for significant variation in \n\ncomposition among microhabitats using the adonis() function in vegan. In the adonis \n\nanalysis, the Bray-Curtis distance matrix of species composition was the response \n\nvariable with biotope as independent variable. In DGGE Bray-Curtis distance matrix \n\neach biotope was the response variable with sampling sites as independent variable. The \n\nnumber of permutations was set at 999; all other arguments used the default values set \n\n\n\nBacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed \n\n38 \n\n \n\nin the function. Weighted averages scores were computed for OTUs on the first two \n\nPCO axes using the wascores() function in the vegan package. Significant differences \n\namong microhabitats in the relative abundance of the most abundant bacterial phyla, \n\nclasses and selected orders and the dominant OTU in each microhabitat were tested with \n\nan analysis of deviance using the glm() function in R. Because data were proportional, a \n\nglm with the family argument set to binomial was firstly applied. Because the ratio of \n\nresidual deviance to residual d.f. in the models substantially exceeded 1, family was set \n\nto \u2018quasibinomial\u2019. In the \u2018quasibinomial\u2019 family, the dispersion parameter is not fixed \n\nat 1 so that it can model over-dispersion. Using the glm model, we tested for significant \n\nvariation among microhabitats using the anova() function in R with the F test, which is \n\nmore appropriate when dispersion is estimated by moments, as is the case of \n\nquasibinomial fits. \n\n \n\nPhylogenetic tree \n\nSelected sequences from dominant OTUs (> 150) and their closest relatives \n\nretrieved from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). These were aligned and a \n\nbootstrap consensus tree was built with 500 replicates with MEGA 5 \n\n(http://www.megasoftware.net/). The bootstrap value represents the percentage of \n\nreplicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together. For tree inference, the \n\nnearest neighbor interchange (NNI) heuristic method and automatic initial tree selection \n\nwere used. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. \n\n \n\nIn silico metagenome analysis \n\nIn the present study, PICRUSt (Langille et al., 2013) was used to predict the \n\nmetagenome of each sample. PICRUSt is a bioinformatics tool that uses marker genes, \n\nin this case 16S rRNA, to predict metagenome gene functional content. These \n\npredictions are pre-calculated for genes in databases including KEGG (Kyoto \n\nEncyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups of \n\nproteins). In this study, the KEGG database and focused on KOs in the polyaromatic \n\ndegradation pathway was used. R was used to generate bargraphs showing the relative \n\nabundance of total genes for each sample. Significant differences among biotopes in the \n\nrelative abundance of total genes were tested with an analysis of deviance using the \n\n\n\nBacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed \n\n39 \n\n \n\nglm() function in R. The glm model, was used to test for significant variation among \n\nbiotopes using the anova() function in R with the F test, which is more appropriate \n\nwhen dispersion is estimated by moments, as is the case of quasibinomial fits. \n\n \n\nResults and Discussion \n\nSediment properties and hydrocarbon contamination \n\nThe sediments of four sites were analyzed comparatively based on their \n\nphysicochemical properties (Table 2.1) and on the quantification and composition of \n\naliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons (Table 2.2). Texture sediment characterization \n\nclassified all sediments as mud, with the exception of sediment from site B (Table 2.1). \n\nIn terms of total hydrocarbons, the concentration calculated as the sum of partial \n\nconcentrations (aliphatic and 16 PAHs) ranged from 5.86 to 21.39 ng g-1 dry weight \n\n(dw), with the highest concentrations observed in site C and the lowest in site B. Sites A \n\nand D presented similar levels of overall hydrocarbon contamination (11.05 and 11.47 \n\nng g-1 dw, respectively). Aliphatic hydrocarbons consisted mainly of C10-C32 n-alkanes \n\nwith total concentration ranging from 3.789 to 10.253 ng g-1 dw (Table 2). The total \n\nconcentration of 16 PAHs in sediment ranged from 1.285 (A) to 11.134 (C) ng g-1 dw \n\n(Table 2.3).  \n\n \n\nTable 2.1.

Sites A and C are located in the Mira \n\nchannel, one of the four main channels of the estuarine system, whereas sites B and D \n\nare located in secondary channels. Another important feature of site C, the most \n\n\n\nBacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed \n\n40 \n\n \n\ncontaminated site, is that it is located close to the Port of Aveiro and exposed to greater \n\nanthropogenic activity (recreational, navigation, urban runoff and shipping activity). \n\nBecause hydrocarbons may have multiple origins, some aliphatic diagnostic indices \n\nwere used to identify biogenic (terrestrial and marine) and/or anthropogenic sources. \n\nPristane (C19) and phytane (C20) are common isoprenoids in coastal marine sediments \n\nand good indicators of petroleum contamination (Readman et al., 2002). The pristane to \n\nphytane ratios (Pr/Ph) of ? 1 reflect petroleum contamination and higher ratios indicate \n\nbiogenic source. In this study, the Pr/Ph ratios (Table 2.2) indicate that hydrocarbons in \n\nsediments are most likely associated to petroleum contamination in sites A, C and D and \n\nare predominantly of biogenic origin at site B. Other aliphatic indicators, such as n-\n\nC17/Pr and n-C18/Ph ratios (Table 2.2), are useful as indicators of early microbial \n\ndegradation (D\u00edez et al., 2007). Generally, lower n-C17/Pr ratios (<1) reflect the relative \n\ncontribution of allochthonous and autochthonous hydrocarbons to the sediment (Mille et \n\nal., 2007). The calculated n-C18/Ph ratios in sediments from sites A and C were low \n\n(0.78\u20131.14), which indicates that microbial biodegradation of n-alkanes is an important \n\nprocess at these sites (D\u00edez et al., 2007).  \n\n \n\nTable 2.2.

The ratio of \n\nlow-molecular-weight (LMW) to high-molecular-weight (HMW) ranged from 0.173 to \n\n0.669 (Table 2.4). Taken together with the Phe/Ant, Fluor/Pyr, Fluor/(Fluor+Pyr) and \n\nInP/(InP+BghiP) ratios (Luo et al., 2005), the results confirm that the PAH \n\ncontamination of salt marsh sediments of Ria de Aveiro is typically related to chronic \n\nfossil fuel exposure. In a recent report, the effect and bioavailability of PAHs in three \n\ndifferent marine sediments (muddy, sand and organic) were tested (Lindgren et al., \n\n2014). Their results show that muddy sediment, although containing the highest total \n\nPAH concentrations after 60 days, had the lowest bioavailable concentration. On the \n\nother hand, sandy sediment contained the lowest total PAH concentrations but the \n\nhighest bioavailability. In this study, the sandy sediment (site B) has the lowest total \n\nhydrocarbon concentration, related to the higher bioavailability characteristic of this \n\ntype of sediment. \n\n \n\nTable 2.4 Origin-indicative PAH ratios and ratio values calculated for this study. \n\nRatio LMW/HMW Phe/Ant Fluor/Pyr Fluor/(Fluor+Pyr) InP/(InP+BghiP) \n\nPyrolytic source \n\n&lt;1&lt;10 >1 >0.5 >0.5 \n\nPetrogenic source \n\n >1 >15&lt;1&lt;0.5&lt;0.2 \n\nReferences Soclo et al., \n2000; Tam et \nal., 2001; \nMagi et al., \n2002 \n\nBudzinski et \nal., 1997; \nBaumard et \nal., 1998; \nBaumard et \nal., 1999 \n\nBudzinski et \nal., 1997; \nBaumard et \nal., 1998; \nBaumard et \nal., 1999 \n\nGogou et al., 1998 Yunker et al., 2002 \n\nSampling sites \n\nA 0.669 1.488 1.135 0.532 0.572 \n\nB 0.358 1.716 1.140 0.533 0.546 \n\nC 0.173 1.917 1.300 0.565 0.587 \n\nD 0.351 1.540 1.137 0.532 0.549 \n\nLMW, Low-molecular weight; HMW, High-molecular-weight; Phe, Phenanthrene; Ant, Anthracene; Fluor, \nFluoranthene; Pyr, Pyrene; InP, Indeno(1,2,3-cd) pyrene; BghiP, Benzo(g,h,i) perylene \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nBacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed \n\n43 \n\n \n\nFig. 2.2 Ordination based on principal \n\ncoordinate analysis (PCO) of bacterial \n\ncommunity profiles of different \n\nmicrohabitats (a, b, c) in each \n\nsampling sites (A, B, C and D). \n\nSite-related variation of the structure of microbial communities  \n\nDGGE fingerprinting analysis revealed a significant association between \n\ncomposition of bacterial communities and sampling site, in the microhabitats \n\ncorresponding to the rhizosphere of H. portulacoides (Adonis F3,15 = 5.07, P &lt;0.001, R\n2 \n\n= 0.559), the rhizosphere of S. perennis subsp. perennis (Adonis F3,15 = 4.57, P &lt;0.001, \n\nR2 = 0.533) and bulk sediment (Adonis F3,15 = 4.18, P &lt;0.001, R\n2 = 0.511). These \n\ndifferences can also be observed in the PCO ordinations present in Fig. 2.2. The first \n\ntwo PCO axes explained approximately 50 % of the variation, with samples of each \n\nsampling site clustering together for each microhabitat.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nBacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed \n\n44 \n\n \n\nIn salt marsh sediments, the composition of the community in terms of the dominant \n\nmicrobial taxa is structured by local factors (Bowen et al., 2009) related with \n\ngeographical localization, environmental conditions and pollutants (C\u00f3rdova-Kreylos et \n\nal., 2006). Studies conducted in the Ria de Aveiro have suggest that environmental \n\nfactors structure bacterial communities (Cleary et al., 2012; Oliveira et al., 2012). In \n\nthis study, localization of the vegetation banks in the complex estuarine system and the \n\ndifferential exposure to environmental contamination, together with different \n\nphysicochemical characteristics and hydrodynamics of each sampling site, might have \n\ninfluenced bacterial composition. The geographical location of site C, close to Port of \n\nAveiro, may explain the higher organic matter content and hydrocarbon concentration in \n\nthe sediment, as compared with the other sites. Site B is located in a secondary channel, \n\nmore sheltered from direct sources of contamination or intense anthropogenic activities. \n\nIn this case, other physicochemical characteristics, and a different sediment texture \n\n(Table 2.1), were probably major determinants of bacterial composition.  \n\nIn this study, hydrocarbon concentrations were lower than reported in other salt \n\nmarshes (Hwang et al., 2006; Watts et al., 2006; Ribeiro et al., 2011). Previous studies \n\nhave, however, shown that relatively low levels of hydrocarbons in the sediment had an \n\neffect on the structural diversity of bacterial communities (Castle et al., 2006; Labb\u00e9 et \n\nal., 2007). \n\n \n\nStructure of bacterial communities in salt marsh sediments \n\nThe structure of sediment bacterial communities associated to H. portulacoides and \n\nS. perennis subsp. perennis roots and bulk salt marsh sediments were determined by \n\n16S rRNA gene amplicons. Proteobacteria represented approximately 60 % of the total \n\nsequences in all samples but Actinobacteria were also well represented in rhizosphere \n\nsamples (Fig. 2.3). Bacteroidetes were the third most dominant group, accounting, on \n\naverage, for 8.3 % of the sequences. These three phyla were the most abundant groups \n\ndetected in a study conducted in a coastal salt marsh during and after the influx of \n\npetroleum hydrocarbons following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (Beazley et al., \n\n2012). The phylum Proteobacteria is considered a dominant group in estuarine \n\nsediment samples (Bowen et al., 2012; Gomes et al., 2013; Gomes et al., 2014). Within \n\nProteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria were the most dominant class in rhizosphere \n\n\n\nBacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed \n\n45 \n\n \n\nsamples (F2,9 = 10.745 p = 0.004) whereas Gammaproteobacteria was the most \n\nabundant class in bulk sediment (Fig. 2.3).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 2.3 Relative abundance of the most represented bacterial taxa: three most abundant \n\nphyla (a, b, c), eight most abundant classes (e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l), the eight most abundant \n\norders (m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t) and the most dominant OTU (d) in bulk sediments (BS), H. \n\nportulacoides rhizosphere (RH) and S. perennis rhizosphere (RS). \n\n\n\nBacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed \n\n46 \n\n \n\nThe distribution of Alphaproteobacteria in marine and freshwater environments is \n\nwell documented and hydrocarbonoclastic Alphaproteobacteria have been detected in \n\nmarine environments (Kim &amp; Kwon, 2010; Newton et al., 2011). On the other hand, \n\nGammaproteobacteria have been reported as abundant in coastal sediment, namely \n\nAtlantic port sediments (Gomes et al., 2013), Eastern Mediterranean Sea sediments \n\n(Polymenakou et al., 2005), Northeastern Pacific (Kouridaki et al., 2010) and South \n\nChina Sea sediments (Zhu et al., 2013). In bulk sediment, Deltaproteobacteria was the \n\nsecond most dominant class (Fig. 2.3), immediately following Gammaproteobacteria. \n\nThe high relative abundance of the Desulfobacterales order in bulk sediment (F2,9 = \n\n4.585 p = 0.042) may be a result of more anaerobic conditions in bulk sediment which \n\nin turn could select for specific guilds such as sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB). These \n\nresults are consistent with other studies conducted in the same estuarine system that \n\nrevealed that the SRB order Desulfobacterales was the most abundant group in \n\nunvegetated sediment (Gomes et al., 2010a; Cleary et al., 2012). In these sediments, \n\ngenerally anoxic just below the surface and suboxic to oxic at the surface (Cunha et al., \n\n2005; Santos et al., 2007), anaerobic metabolism such as fermentation and anaerobic \n\nrespiration, may represent the major pathways of organic matter oxidation. The high \n\nrelative proportion of SRB in salt marsh sediments can be explained by the availability \n\nof fermentation-derived substrates directly utilized by SRB (Hines et al., 1999). \n\nMoreover, sulfate-reducing strains capable of growing and degrading hydrocarbons \n\nhave been isolated from hydrocarbon-polluted marine sediment (Cravo-Laureau et al., \n\n2004), and some strains were capable of  oxidizing alkenes (Aeckersberg et al., 1991; \n\nCravo-Laureau et al., 2004). SRB play critical roles in a variety of processes in coastal \n\nmarine sediments such as, organic matter turnover, biodegradation of pollutants, \n\nsequestration of metals, and sulfur and carbon cycles (Zhang et al., 2008). Also, recent \n\nstudies showed that the relative abundance of the order Desulfobacterales increases in \n\nmarine sediments contaminated with OH (Su\u00e1rez et al., 2011; Acosta?Gonz\u00e1lez et al., \n\n2013). A phylogenetic tree of selected dominant OTUs (> 150 sequence reads) and their \n\nclosest relatives was constructed (Fig. 2.4).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nBacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed \n\n47 \n\n \n\n  \n\nFig. 2.4 Phylogenetic tree showing the Proteobacteria (A) and Actinobacteria-\n\nAcidobacteria-Bacteriodetes (B) clusters from bulk sediment and salt marsh \n\nrhizospheres of H. portulacoides and S. perennis.

H: Microhabitat (rhizosphere \n\nsamples from Halimione portulacoides (Hal) and Sarcocornia perennis subsp. perennis \n\n(Sar)); S: Sampling site (A, B, C or D); RA: Relative abundance of the respective OTU. \n\n\n\nBacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed \n\n48 \n\n \n\nThe phylogenetic analysis revealed bacterial phylotypes closely related with phyla \n\nProteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria. Only one abundant OTU (18) was \n\nassociated with bulk sediment. This OTU was classified as belonging to the \n\nAcidobacteria class and closely related to an uncultured bacterium (AF523900) isolated \n\nfrom forest wetland impacted by coal (Brofft et al., 2002). Most bacterial populations in \n\nboth rhizospheres showed phylogenetic affiliation with ecotypes from a wide diversity \n\nof marine environments. Moreover, the majority of these ecotypes are related to \n\nhydrocarbon impacted sediments (Fig. 2.4). \n\n \n\n  \n\nFig. 2.4 (continued). \n\n\n\nBacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed \n\n49 \n\n \n\nA study performed after the Prestige oil spill revealed that members of the classes \n\nAlphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria were the prevailing groups of bacteria in \n\nshoreline environments (Alonso-Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 2009). Also, a predominance of \n\nGamma- and Deltaproteobacteria in anaerobic bacteria communities of coastal \n\nsediments was reported after the Prestige oil spill (Acosta?Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2013). The \n\nphylogenetic analysis showed that some OTUs associated with S. perennis rhizosphere \n\nwere closely related to gut bacteria (OTU 15) and uncultured Acidobacteria from \n\ncoastal soils (OTU 45; Fig. 2.4A).  \n\n \n\nPlant-related variation in the structure of bacterial communities \n\nOverall analysis of the barcoded pyrosequencing data, comparing all rhizosphere \n\nsamples against bulk sediment samples, showed significant differences between \n\nbacterial communities from bulk sediment and rhizospheres (Adonis F2,11 = 2.09, P &lt;\n\n0.001, R2 = 0.317). Shannon indices indicate that bacterial communities of S. perennis \n\nsubsp. perennis rhizosphere were more diverse than H. portulacoides rhizosphere and \n\nbulk sediment (Table 2.S1). The PCO ordination of bacterial operational taxonomic \n\nunits (OTUs; Fig. 2.5) indicates that the two rhizospheres shared the most abundant \n\nOTUs (large grey circles; > 150 sequences). The rhizosphere effect can explain the \n\nhigher number of OTUs in these samples, when compared to bulk sediment, and \n\nunderlies an apparent convergent adaptation of rhizosphere communities. Plant-bacteria \n\ninteractions, exerted through the release of exudates that create a unique \n\nphysicochemical environment surrounding roots, explained the different shifts in \n\nbacterial community composition between rhizospheres and bulk sediment. The \n\nhalophyte exudates provide oxygen and high-quality sources of carbon and energy for \n\nbacterial growth (Bagwell et al., 1998). Moreover, roots provide physical support and \n\ndistinct chemical conditions (Singh et al., 2004; Mucha et al., 2010) and the presence of \n\nplants differentially promotes the development of some bacterial groups (Berg &amp; \n\nSmalla, 2009; Mucha et al., 2011; Gomes et al., 2014).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nBacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed \n\n50 \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 2.5 (a) Ordination based on principal coordinate analysis (PCO) of pyrosequencing \n\ndata.

The orders \n\nAcidimicrobiales, Rhodobacterales, Rhizobiales, Sphingobacteriales and \n\nRhodospirillales were also more abundant in rhizospheres than in bulk sediment (Fig. \n\n2.3). The rhizosphere of H. portulacoides showed enrichment of Rhizobiales and \n\nAcidimicrobiales. Rhizobiales members are involved in atmospheric nitrogen fixation \n\nby plants and some members of this group have also been reported as degraders of \n\naromatic hydrocarbon compounds (Baek et al., 2003). Acidimicrobiales members have \n\nbeen considered to be responsive to changes in soil pH (Lauber et al., 2009). Members \n\nof the Actinobacteria phylum capable of degrading hydrocarbons were isolated from \n\nArtic native plant species (Ferrera-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2013). The rhizosphere of S. \n\nperennis subsp. perennis showed enrichment of Rhodobacterales, Sphingobacteriales \n\nand Rhodospirillales. Rhodobacterales have been associated with the degradation of \n\n\n\nBacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed \n\n51 \n\n \n\naliphatic and low-molecular weight aromatic hydrocarbon (Harwati et al., 2007) and the \n\nassociation of Sphingobacteriales and Rhodospirillales members with PAH and \n\npetroleum degradation in soil has also been previously reported (Gomes et al., 2010b; \n\nMao et al., 2012).  \n\nPhylogenetic analysis of the dominant selected OTUs (> 150 sequence reads) \n\nshowed that thirteen of these OTUs, predominant in rhizosphere samples, are closely \n\nrelated to ecotypes of OH impacted sediments (Fig. 2.4). Six OTUs (5, 14, 19, 30, 4167 \n\nand 4435) were related to organisms assigned to the Acidimicrobiales order, which were \n\npreviously reported from oil-polluted subtidal sediments (Acosta-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2013) \n\nas well as from fuel pollution-affected shoreline environments (Alonso-Guti\u00e9rrez et al., \n\n2009). OTUs 19 and 14 were enriched in the rhizosphere of S. perennis subsp. perennis \n\nin the most contaminated sampling site (C), and OTUs 5, 30, 4167 and 4435 in the \n\nrhizosphere of H. portulacoides in sampling site A where the aliphatic hydrocarbon \n\nconcentration is higher (Fig. 2.4B; Table 2.2). The other seven OTUs (7, 10, 20, 21, 24, \n\n36 and 4104) were predominantly enriched in the rhizosphere of S. perennis subsp. \n\nperennis in site B, the second most polluted site (Fig. 2.4A; Table 2.3). These OTUs are \n\nphylogenetically closely related to proteobacterial orders that are known OH degraders. \n\nIn this study, OTUs 10 and 24 were assigned to Myxococcales and Desulfobacteraceae, \n\nrespectively. Both of these OTUs are affiliated to sulfate reducing groups that may play \n\nan important role in hydrocarbon degradation in contaminated coastal sediments (Paisse \n\net al., 2008; Acosta?Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2013). Members of Xanthomonadales (OTU 21), \n\nRhodospirillaceae (OTU 7) and Rhizobiales (OTU 20) that were detected in this study \n\nwere associated with organisms related to either alkane degradation or oil-polluted sites \n\n(Vi\u00f1as et al. 2005; Alonso-Guti\u00e9rrez et al. 2009; Patel et al., 2012). According to the \n\nphylogenetic analysis, the OTU 2094 was clustered into family Rhodobacteraceae. \n\nMembers of this family have highly diverse metabolism and includes \n\nhydrocarbonoclastic species from freshwater and marine environments (Chang et al., \n\n2000; Brakstad &amp; L\u00f8deng, 2005). Two dominant OTUs (38 and 4104) showed close \n\nphylogenetic relationship to the genus Erythrobacter. Several marine oil-hydrocarbon \n\ndegrading stains related to Erythrobacter sp. were found to contain cytochrome P450 \n\nCYP153 and alkB genes (Wang et al., 2010). The alk genes code for an important \n\nenzyme involved in n-alkanes environmental degradation, and CYP153A genes were \n\n\n\nBacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed \n\n52 \n\n \n\ndetected in petroleum-contaminated soil, groundwater and coastal seawater (Kubota et \n\nal., 2005). Our phylogenetic analysis also showed a dominance of OTUs closely related \n\nto Actinobacteria in H. portulacoides rhizosphere, members with high G+C content, are \n\ngram-positive and are physiologically diverse. In this study, the OTUs sequences for \n\nAcidimicrobiales order were mostly phylogenetic associated with uncultured \n\nActinobacteria members. These observations mirrored results from uncultured (Militon \n\net al., 2010) and culture-based (Pucci et al., 2000) approaches suggesting that \n\nActinobacteria (Acidimicrobiales and Actinomycetales) might play a role in the \n\nbioremediation of alkane-contaminated sediments. Autochthonous strains with the \n\ncapacity to degrade alkanes were isolated from crude oil polluted sites (Pucci et al., \n\n2000). Moreover, it was observed that during bioremediation processes the active \n\nactinobacterial phylotypes increase (Militon et al., 2010). The abundance of sequences \n\nphylogenetically related to hydrocarbon degrading organisms in the rhizosphere \n\nsamples analyzed in this study provides evidence that halophyte plant colonization is an \n\nimportant driver of the structure of hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial communities in salt \n\nmarshes and demonstrates the potential of plant-bacteria interactions in processes of \n\nmicrobe-assisted phytoremediation of hydrocarbons in coastal ecosystems. \n\n \n\nIn silico metagenome analysis \n\nPICRUSt algorithm was used to predict metagenome functional content based on \n\nthe Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) classification to identify \n\npotential bacterial traits in different microhabitats. Figure 2.6 shows the relative gene \n\ncount of selected KOs that might be involved in PAH degradation pathways \n\n(www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?ko00624). Significant differences from three \n\nselected KOs were observed. KOs K00449, K00517 and K00599, have a higher relative \n\ngene frequency in rhizosphere samples, but not KO K00492, a methyltransferase \n\ninvolved in the final pathway of phenanthrene and pyrene degradation. K00492, \n\noxidoreductase, is important in the initial steps of the phenanthrene degradation \n\npathway. The protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (K00449) produced by pcaH is \n\nimportant in the final steps of the metabolism of several PAHs (fluorene, anthracene \n\nand phenanthrene). K00517 is an oxidoreductase that acts in the initial step of \n\nanthracene degradation to 9,10-anthraquinone. These selected KOs are not exclusive of \n\n\n\nBacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed \n\n53 \n\n \n\nPAH degradation pathways but are involved in other metabolic pathways especially \n\nrelated to the degradation of aromatic compounds (www.genome.jp/kegg/).  \n\nDespite the fact that the data obtained here were derived from an in silico \n\nmetagenome analysis, the functional genetic information obtained still represents an \n\nimportant resource for the initial evaluation of the distribution of potential bacterial \n\ntraits in different microhabitats. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig 2.6 Relative gene count of selected KOs could possible involved in PAH \n\ndegradation. Samples are represented by symbols (BS \u2013 Bulk sediment; RH \u2013 H. \n\nportulacoides rhizosphere and RS \u2013 S. perennis subsp. perennis rhizosphere).

The results of this study demonstrate that \n\nthe structure of bacterial communities is probably affected by site-related factors, such \n\nas sediment properties and hydrocarbon contamination, and by plant-related factors.  \n\nThe barcoded pyrosequencing approach used in this study provided a \n\ncomprehensive overview of the rhizosphere bacterial communities associated with two \n\nimportant halophyte plants from temperate estuaries. The results indicate that root \n\nsystems of H. portulacoides and S. perennis subsp. perennis appear to be able to exert a \n\nstrong influence on bacterial composition. The orders Acidimicrobiales and Rhizobiales \n\n\n\nBacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed \n\n54 \n\n \n\nwere both associated with the rhizospheres of both halophytes whereas the order \n\nDesulfobacterales was associated with bulk sediment. In addition to this, the in silico \n\nmetagenome analysis revealed a possible higher number of genes involved in the \n\nprocess of PAH degradation in the rhizosphere of halophytic plants. This indicates that \n\nhalophyte plant colonization could be an important driver of hydrocarbonovlastic \n\nbacteria community structure in salt marsh sediments, which can be exploited for in situ \n\nphytoremediation of OH in salt marsh environments. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThis work had financial support from CESAM research unit (Pest \n\nC/MAR/LA0017/2011), QOPNA research unit (PEst-C/QUI/UI0062/2013; FCOMP-\n\n01-0124-FEDER-037296), Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) \n\nproject PTDC/AAC-CLI/107916/2008 (http://alfa.fct.mctes.pt) and COMPETES-\n\n(FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-008657).

The process of salt marsh plant \n\nsurvival in such environment is very intriguing and at the same time poorly understood. \n\nPlant-microbe interactions may play a key role in the process of environment and in \n\nplanta detoxification. In this study, a combination of culture-dependent and -\n\nindependent molecular approaches [enrichment cultures, polymerase chain reaction \n\n(PCR), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), DNA sequencing] were used to \n\ninvestigate the effect of oil hydrocarbons (OH) contamination on the structure and \n\nfunction [polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) dioxygenase genes] of endophytic \n\nbacterial communities of salt marsh plant species (Halimione portulacoides and \n\nSarcocornia perennis subsp. perennis) in the estuarine system Ria de Aveiro (Portugal). \n\nPseudomonads dominated the cultivable fraction of the endophytic communities in the \n\nenrichment cultures. In a set of fifty isolates tested, nine were positive for genes \n\nencoding for PAH dioxygenases (nahAc) and four were positive for plasmid carrying \n\ngenes encoding PAH degradation enzymes (nahAc). Interestingly, these plasmids were \n\nonly detected in isolates from most severely OH polluted sites. The results revealed site-\n\nspecific effects on endophytic communities, related to the level of OH contamination in \n\nthe sediment, and plant-species-specific \u201cimprints\u201d in community structure and in genes \n\nencoding for PAH dioxygenases. These results suggest a potential ecological role of \n\nbacterial plant symbiosis in the process of plant colonization in urban estuarine areas \n\nexposed to OH contamination. \n\n \n\nKeywords: endophytic; salt marsh plants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, PAH \n\ndegrading genes  \n\n\n\nEndophytic with degradative hydrocarbon potential \n\n58 \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\nSalt marshes are highly productive intertidal environments that serve as nursery \n\ngrounds for many commercially and economically important species. Because of their \n\nphysical and biological characteristics, salt marshes are considered particularly \n\nsusceptible to anthropogenic inputs of petroleum hydrocarbons (PH) (Carman et al., \n\n1996; Watts et al., 2006; Martins et al. 2008). The sediment contamination with PH, \n\nespecially lower molecular weight aromatic hydrocarbons, can interfere with the \n\ndevelopment of salt marsh plants (Watts et al., 2006; Watts et al., 2008). Due to the \n\nconstant input of different pollutants to salt marshes located in urban areas, restoration \n\napproaches based on natural recovery processes may take decades. However, the use of \n\nplants for bioremediation (phytoremediation) associated to indigenous degrading \n\nmicroorganisms for removal or sequestration of pollutants has been intensively studied \n\n(Phillips et al., 2008; Germaine et al., 2009; Afzal et al., 2011; Khan et al., 2013). This \n\napproach may accelerate the process of environmental recovery and diminish the costs \n\nassociated with more invasive technologies. \n\nSeveral studies show that plant roots harbour a diverse microbial population in their \n\nrhizo- and endosphere that are enriched in important catabolic genotypes for \n\nhydrocarbons degradation (Gomes et al., 2010a; Yousaf et al., 2010b). These degrading \n\nbacteria may have a potential for detoxification of the sediment surrounding the roots \n\n(Geiselbrecht et al., 1996; Daane et al., 2001; Phillips et al., 2006; Watts et al., 2008; \n\nYousaf et al., 2010b) or, in the case of endophytes, may be important for in planta \n\nhydrocarbons degradation and detoxification (Siciliano et al., 2001; Phillips et al., 2008; \n\nYousaf et al., 2010b). In this scenario, endophytes may empower the plant with the \n\nbiological detoxification resources required for enhanced survival in contaminated \n\nenvironments.  \n\nEndophytic bacteria are described as nonpathogenic bacteria colonizing internal \n\nplant tissues, without causing symptoms of disease (Taghavi et al., 2005; Lodewyckx et \n\nal., 2002). Roots are the major entry of endophytic bacteria into the plant system, \n\npresenting higher bacterial densities than other parts of the plant (Lodewyckx et al., \n\n2002). Therefore, factors that are determinant in the structure of rhizosphere \n\ncommunities, such as soil properties (Marschner et al., 2001; Jung et al., 2008; Afzal et \n\nal., 2011) or plant specific factors (Grayston et al., 1996; Marschner et al., 2001; \n\n\n\nEndophytic with degradative hydrocarbon potential \n\n59 \n\n \n\nSiciliano et al., 2001), are also likely to influence the diversity of endophytic \n\ncommunities. In general, endophytic bacteria are highly diverse and ubiquitous in most \n\nplant species (monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous) and the most common genera \n\nfound are Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, Bacillus, and Azospirillum (Lodewyckx et al., \n\n2002). The capacities of endophytic bacteria to act as plant growth promoters or \n\nenhance plant resistance to pathogens are known (Compant et al., 2005; Zachow et al., \n\n2008). Recently, studies on the structural and functional diversity of endophytic \n\nhydrocarbon degraders from different impacted environments and different types of \n\nplants (essentially plants used for hay and green manure) show distinct degradative \n\npotential for hydrocarbon pollutants (Phillips et al., 2008; Yousaf et al., 2010b). In fact, \n\nthe presence of bacteria carrying genes or catabolic plasmids with genes encoding PH \n\nmetabolism in planta may contribute to the process of plant and soil (or sediment) PH \n\ndetoxification in contaminated areas. The presence of PH degradative genes on mobile \n\ngenetic elements, such as plasmids, has been pointed out as an important spreading \n\nmechanism for PH catabolic abilities among bacteria in contaminated areas. Horizontal \n\ngene transfer of PH degrading genes in contaminated areas has been reported, thereby \n\nenabling the hosts with oil hydrocarbon degrading capacities and contributing to \n\nmicrobial community acclimation to environmental pollutants (Herrick et al., 1997; Ma \n\net al., 2006). A better understanding of the endophytic communities of salt marsh plants \n\nin contaminated coastal ecosystems may contribute fundamental information to the \n\ndevelopment of new approaches based on plant-microbe association for restoration of \n\nimpacted areas.  \n\nThe rhizosphere effect in the process of PH degradation has been progressively \n\nrecognized. However, only very few studies have focused on the rhizosphere of salt \n\nmarsh vegetation (Daane et al., 2001; Mucha et al., 2011) and practically none on the \n\nassociated endophytic bacterial communities. Moreover, sediment properties, such as \n\nhydrocarbon contamination, organic matter content, and texture, are important drivers \n\nof bacterial community composition in coastal environments (Langworthy et al., 1998; \n\nGomes et al., 2008; Liang et al., 2011; Wang &amp; Tam 2012; Gomes et al., 2013). \n\nHowever, there is a lack of studies on the influence of these parameters on the structure \n\nand function of the endophytic bacterial communities. \n\n\n\nEndophytic with degradative hydrocarbon potential \n\n60 \n\n \n\nFig. 3.1 Ria de Aveiro (Portugal) with \n\nthe location of sampling stations (A, B, \n\nC or D).   \n\nIn this study, culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches were used to \n\ninvestigate the effects of PH contamination on the structure (cultivation and 16S rRNA \n\ngene community fingerprint analyses) and function (plasmids and PAH dioxygenase \n\ngenes) of endophytic bacterial communities from salt marsh plant species (Halimione \n\nportulacoides and Sarcocornia perennis subsp. perennis) in a temperate estuarine \n\nsystem (Ria de Aveiro, Portugal). Sediment properties were also analysed to obtain \n\nmore complete characterization of the sampling sites and evaluate their potential effect \n\non the structure of the bacterial endophytic community. This work also aimed to \n\nprovide evidences that naturally occurring endophytic bacteria may have potential to \n\ncontribute for in planta detoxification of OH compounds and to plant colonization in \n\nOH polluted urban estuarine areas. \n\n \n\nMaterial and Methods \n\nExperimental site and sampling  \n\nThe salt marshes investigated in this \n\nstudy are located in Ria de Aveiro-\n\nPortugal, a shallow estuary-coastal lagoon \n\nsystem on the northwest cost of Portugal \n\n(40.7\u00b0 N, 8.7\u00b0 W), consisting of a complex \n\nnetwork of channels with extensive \n\nintertidal zones (Dias et al., 1999). Plant \n\nsamples were collected at low tide in four \n\nsalt marshes: site A, 40?35\u00b452.64\u00b4\u00b4N, \n\n8?45\u00b4.0071\u00b4\u00b4W; site B, 40?38\u00b427.42\u00b4\u00b4N, \n\n8?44\u00b415.42\u00b4\u00b4W; site C, 40?37\u00b432.18\u00b4\u00b4N, \n\n8?44\u00b409.12\u00b4\u00b4W; site D, 40?37\u00b418.90\u00b4\u00b4N, \n\n8?39\u00b446.28\u00b4\u00b4W (Fig. 31). From each site, \n\nfour composite samples of two widely \n\ndistributed salt marsh plant species \n\n(Halimione portulacoides and Sarcocornia \n\nperennis subsp. perennis) were stored \n\nseparately in sterile plastic bags. These two species were chosen for their wide \n\n\n\nEndophytic with degradative hydrocarbon potential \n\n61 \n\n \n\ndistribution and ecological importance and for being two of the most common species in \n\nthe study area. The endophytic community was recovered from fresh roots. Root \n\nmaterial was vigorously washed in distilled water (5 min) and root surface was \n\ndisinfected by sequential washing with 95% ethanol and 1% sodium hypochlorite \n\nsupplemented with one droplet Tween 80, and rinsed three times in sterile distilled \n\nwater (Barac et al., 2004). A 100 \u00b5 L sample of final rinsing water was spread-plated on \n\n869 medium (Mergeay et al., 1985) to check the efficiency of disinfection.  \n\n \n\nSediment properties  \n\nThe pH value of bulk sediments was measured in a sediment: water suspension [1:5 \n\n(w/v)] (Faoun 1984), using a pre-calibrated pH meter (Orion Model 290A). Organic \n\nmatter (OM) content was analyzed as percentage of weight loss by ignition at 450 \u00b0C, \n\nfor 8 h (SPAC 2000). Sediment grain size was analyzed by wet and dry sieving \n\n(Quintino et al., 1989).  \n\nFreeze-dried sediment samples were homogenized and analyzed for aliphatic and \n\naromatic hydrocarbons after a Soxhlet extraction followed by GC-MS analysis. For \n\nassessing the efficiency of recovery, 5 g sub-samples of sediment were spiked with 25 \n\n\u00b5 L (2 \u00b5 g mL-1) deuterated surrogate standards (naphthalene-d8, acenaphthene-d10, \n\nphenanthrene-d10, chrysene-d12 and perylene-d12 (Supelco) and extracted for 24 h in a \n\nSoxhlet apparatus with 150 mL of dichloromethane. Sample extracts were concentrated \n\nby rotary evaporation up to a volume of about 2-3 mL, and solvent changed to 10 mL of \n\nhexane, which was further reduced to approximately 1-2 mL. Hydrocarbons \n\nconcentrated in hexane extracts were separated using a deactivated 2:1 alumina/silica \n\ngel column. Elution was performed using 15 mL of hexane to yield the first fraction \n\n(aliphatic hydrocarbons), followed by 30 mL of dichloromethane:hexane (1:1). Sample \n\nvolume was reduced to 1 mL on a rotary evaporator, evaporated under nitrogen gas to \n\n0.2 mL, transferred to a GC vial, and 25 \u00b5 L of the internal standard, hexamethylbenzene \n\n(2 mg mL-1) were added. GC-MS analyses were carried using an Agilent Network GC \n\nsystem, namely an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a mass selective \n\ndetector (MSD 5973) with electron impact ionization (EI) operating at 70 eV (Agilent \n\nTechnologies). A VF-5MS fused silica column (30 m x 0.25 mm i.d and 0.25 \u00b5 m film \n\nthickness) was used for analytes separation. The carrier gas used was helium with a \n\n\n\nEndophytic with degradative hydrocarbon potential \n\n62 \n\n \n\nflow rate of 1.3 mL min-1. Injector and transfer-line temperatures were set at 300 \u00baC. \n\nThe ion source was maintained at 230 \u00baC. A 1 \u00b5 L splitless injection volume was \n\ndelivered with a 10 \u00b5 L Hamilton syringe. The initial column temperature was \n\nmaintained at 60 \u00baC for 1 min, ramped to 200 \u00baC at a rate of 10 \u00baC min-1; a second ramp \n\nof 5 \u00baC min-1 raised the column temperature to 300 \u00baC, which was kept for 8 min. For \n\naromatic hydrocarbons the selected ion monitoring (SIM) acquisition mode was used. \n\nThe full scan acquisition mode (in a range between m/z 20 and m/z 500) was used to \n\ndetect aliphatic hydrocarbons, and for quantification two internal standards were used: \n\nundecane (C11H24) and tetracosane (C24H50). \n\n \n\nEndophytic communities \n\nDNA extraction \n\nExtraction of total DNA from the endophytic communities (TC-DNA) was \n\nperformed using a bead-beating protocol previously outlined in the study by Phillips et \n\nal., 2006. About 2 g of surface disinfected root material was macerated in liquid \n\nnitrogen. The cell lysis was achieved by a combination of bead-beating, proteinase K \n\n(20 mg mL-1) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (20%). Cellular debris and proteins were \n\nprecipitated with aqueous 7.5 M ammonium acetate. DNA was subsequently \n\nprecipitated with isopropanol, washed with 70% cold ethanol and re-suspended in 50 \u00b5 L \n\nTE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA; pH 8.0). The endophytic TC-DNA was \n\npurified with the GeneClean Spin Kit (MP Biomedicals). \n\n \n\nDGGE analysis \n\n The structural diversity of the endophytic communities was assessed by DGGE \n\nfingerprint analysis of TC-DNA of 16S rRNA gene fragments, after a nested-PCR \n\napproach (Gomes et al., 2008). First, 16S rRNA gene fragments were amplified using \n\nthe primers U27F and 1492R (Table 1). Reaction mixtures (25 \u00b5 L) contained 12.5 \u00b5l \n\nDreamTaq\u2122 PCR Master Mix (Fisher Scientific), 0.1 \u00b5M of each primer, 80 \u00b5 g mL-1 \n\nbovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1 \u00b5 L of template DNA. The amplification conditions \n\nwere as follows: initial denaturation (94 \u00baC for 5 min); 25 cycles of denaturation (94 \u00baC \n\nfor 45 s), annealing (56 \u00baC for 45 s), and extension (72 \u00baC for 1.5 min), and a final \n\nextension (72 \u00baC for 10 min). The amplicons obtained from the first PCR were used as a \n\n\n\nEndophytic with degradative hydrocarbon potential \n\n63 \n\n \n\ntemplate for a second PCR with bacterial DGGE primers 984F-GC and 1378R (Table \n\n1). The PCR reaction mixtures (25 \u00b5 L) consisted of 12.5 \u00b5l DreamTaq\u2122 PCR Master \n\nMix (Fisher Scientific), 0.1 \u00b5 M of each primer, 1 % (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) \n\nand 1 \u00b5 L of template DNA. After 4 min of denaturation at 94 \u00baC, 30 thermal cycles of 1 \n\nmin at 95 \u00b0C, 1 min at 53 \u00b0C, and 1.5 min at 72 \u00b0C, the PCR was finished by an \n\nextension step at 72 \u00b0C for 7 min. Five \u00b5 L of PCR products were analyzed by \n\nelectrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and stained with GelRed (Biotium). \n\nThe DGGE of the amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments was performed using DCode \n\nSystem (Universal Mutation Detection System, Bio-Rad). PCR products containing \n\napproximately equal amounts of DNA were loaded onto 6-10 % (w/v) polyacrylamide \n\ngel in 1 x TAE buffer (0.04 M Tris-Acetate, 0.001 M EDTA; pH 8.0). The 6-10 % \n\npolyacrylamide gel was made with a denaturing gradient ranging from 40 to 58 %. \n\nElectrophoresis was performed for 16 h at 80 V at 60 \u00b0C in 1 x TAE buffer. Following \n\nelectrophoresis, the gels were silver-stained according to Heuer et al., (2001). \n\n  \n\nDetection of PAH degrading genes  \n\nThe presence of genes encoding the large subunit of naphthalene-1,2-dioxygenase \n\n(nahAc) and alpha subunit of the PAH ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases genes, both \n\nrelated to PAH degradation, was detected by PCR using the primers and reaction \n\nconditions described by Wilson et al., (1999) and C\u00e9bron et al., (2008), respectively \n\n(Table 3.1).  \n\n \n\nDetermination of gene copy number of PAH ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase genes of \n\nGram-negative bacteria  \n\nQuantification of PAH ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase of Gram-negative bacteria \n\nwas carried out using the primers and probe previously described by C\u00e9bron et al., \n\n(2008) by real-time PCR (Applied Biosystems StepOne\u2122 Real-Time PCR System). \n\nAmplification was performed in 20 \u00b5 L reaction volume containing 11 \u00b5 L SYBR\u00ae \n\nGreen PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.2 \u00b5 M of each primer (IBA GmbH), \n\n0.55 \u00b5 L of DMSO, 100 \u00b5 g mL-1 of BSA and 1 \u00b5 L of template TC-DNA. The \n\ntemperature profile was 95 \u00baC for 10 min followed by 45 cycles at 95 \u00baC for 30 s, 57 \u00baC \n\nfor 30 s, 72 \u00baC for 30 s and a data collection step of 10 s at 80 \u00baC. The final step \n\n\n\nEndophytic with degradative hydrocarbon potential \n\n64 \n\n \n\nconsisted of 72 \u00baC for 7 min. A final melt curve analysis, from 6 \u00baC below amplification \n\ntemperature, to 95 \u00baC, concluded the cycling program. Templates to generate standard \n\ncurves were serial dilutions of amplicon of Pseudomonas putida pNF149 (108 to 102). \n\nThe samples were 10 times diluted prior to amplification to avoid problems with \n\ninhibitors. DNA samples were used at a concentration of 4-11 ng \u00b5 L-1. \n\n \n\nTable 3.1 Primers and conditions used for PCR amplification. \n\nPrimer  Primer sequence (5\u00b4to 3\u00b4)  \nAnnealing \ntemperature \n(\u00baC) \n\nPrimer \n(\u00b5 M) \n\nFragment \nsize (bp) \n\nReference \n\nUniversal 16S rRNA \n\nU27F AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG 56 0.25 ca. 1450 (Weisburg et \nal., 1991) 1492R GGT TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT T \n\n   \n968F-GC* AAC GCG AAG AAC CTT AC \n\n \n53 0.25 ca. 473 (Heuer et al., \n\n1997) 1378R CGG TGT GTA CAA GGC CCG GGA ACG \n   \n\nPAH degrading genes       \n\nProtocol 1: Naphthalene dioxygenase (nahAc) \nAc114F CTG GC(T/A)(T/A)TT (T/C)CT CAC (T/C)CA T 56.5 0.2 ca. 482 (Wilson et \n\nal., 1999) Ac596R C(G/A)G GTG (C/T)CT TCC AGT TG \n   \n\nPAH ring-hydroxylating dioxigenase (PAH-RHD?)      \nProtocol 2 \nPAH-RHD?

The enrichment consisted of a \n\n\n\nEndophytic with degradative hydrocarbon potential \n\n65 \n\n \n\nseries of batch cultures containing two different carbon sources: 2-methylnaphthalene \n\nand diesel oil mixture (98 octane gasoline with 2 % engine oil). The first enrichment \n\nconsisted of inoculation with 1 mL of endophytic extract to 50 mL of sterile mineral \n\nmedium (MM) (Ma et al. 2006) supplemented with 10 mg of 2-methylnaphthalene \n\ncrystals or with 1% filter-sterilized diesel oil (0.2 \u00b5m, PTFE membranes). \n\nCycloheximide (100 mg/L) was added to the selective media to suppress fungal growth. \n\nControl flasks without root extracts were included. The flasks were covered with non-\n\nabsorbent cotton wool and incubated at room temperature in the dark with agitation \n\n(100 rpm) for 7 days. Two more selection rounds were conducted by sub-culturing 1 \n\nmL from the previous culture in 50 mL of mineral medium with the corresponding \n\ncarbon source. Aliquots of each selective culture were stored at -80 \u00baC in 1 mL of \n\nglucose broth (Fluka) with 25 % glycerol, for molecular studies.  \n\nFrom each selective culture, 100 \u00b5 L replicate aliquots were spread-plated in two \n\ndifferent media: R2A and King B (Merck). Isolated colonies were selected based on \n\nmorphology and color and purified by successive streak-plating on R2A and King B \n\nmedium. After purity confirmation, selected colonies were transferred to LB Medium \n\nwith 15 % glycerol and frozen at - 20 \u00b0C until processing. \n\n \n\nDNA extraction  \n\nExtraction of genomic DNA from endophytic isolates was performed after cell lysis \n\nwith the Qiagen genomic DNA extraction kit (Qiagen), in combination with Fermentas \n\nDNA Extraction Kit (Fermentas). \n\n \n\nCharacterization and identification of endophytic strains  \n\nEndophytic strains were grouped by the similarity of BOX-PCR genomic \n\nfingerprints using the BOX_A1R primer (Martin et al., 1992). For strains with distinct \n\nfingerprints, the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using PCR universal bacterial primers \n\nU27 and 1492R (Weisburg et al., 1991) and sequenced. The partial 16S rRNA \n\nsequences were compared with different sequences available in the GenBank database \n\nusing BLAST-N (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nEndophytic with degradative hydrocarbon potential \n\n66 \n\n \n\nDetection of genes encoding for PAH degradation  \n\nThe presence of nahAc and PAH ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase genes was \n\ndetected by PCR using the primers and reaction conditions described by Wilson et al. \n\n(1999) and C\u00e9bron et al., (2008), respectively (Table 3.1), as previously described for \n\ncommunity DNA. \n\n \n\nPCR-detection of broad host range (BHR) plasmids \n\nA PCR approach was used for detection of BHR plasmid-specific sequences in \n\nDNA extracted from isolated endophytic strains. The amplifications of plasmid-specific \n\nsequences of IncP-1 (trfA gene), IncP-7 (rep gene) and IncP-9 (oriV-rep genes) were \n\nperformed with the primers and conditions summarized in Table 3.1. The positive PCR \n\namplicons were confirmed by Southern-blot hybridization (SBH) on Hybond N nylon \n\nmembranes (Amersham Hybond-N; GE Healthcare) according to Sambrook &amp; Russell \n\n(2001). PCR amplicons of IncP-9 were hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled mixed \n\nprobe generated from typical IncP-9 plasmids. Detection of hybridization with the DIG-\n\nlabeled probe was performed with a DIG luminescent detection kit (Roche Applied \n\nScience) as specified by the manufacturer, using an X-ray film (Roche Applied \n\nScience). \n\n \n\nPlasmid-DNA extraction and characterization  \n\nPlasmids were obtained by alkaline extraction according to the adaptation of the \n\nprocedure by Birnboim &amp; Doly (1979) described by Smalla et al., (2000). For plasmid \n\ncharacterization, extracted DNA was digested for 4 h at 37 \u00baC with a combination of the \n\nrestriction enzymes PstI and Bst11071 (Fisher Scientific). Restriction fragments were \n\nseparated on a 0.8 % agarose gel for 2 h at 50 V and stained with GelRed (Biotium). \n\n \n\nDetection of genes encoding for PAH degradation enzymes in plasmidic DNA \n\nThe presence of specific catabolic genes encoding enzymes involved in hydrocarbon \n\ndegradation in plasmids extracted from isolated strains was assessed using specific \n\nprimers for the nahAc and PAH ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase genes (Table 3.1). A \n\ntouchdown PCR programme was used for the amplification of nahAc-like genes, as \n\n\n\nEndophytic with degradative hydrocarbon potential \n\n67 \n\n \n\ndescribed by Wilson et al., (1999). A 16S rDNA PCR negative control reaction was \n\nconducted to ensure the absence of bacterial chromosomal DNA.  \n\n  \n\nSequence analysis of PAH degrading genes and phylogenetic tree \n\nAmplicons of PAH degrading genes were cleaned using GeneClean II Kit (MP \n\nBiomedicals) following the manufacturer\u00b4s instructions and sequenced at external \n\nfacilities (StabVida). Sequenced genes were compared with sequences available in the \n\nGenBank\u00ae database by using the BLAST service to determine their closest relative. \n\n \n\nStatistical analysis  \n\nThe DGGE profile analysis was conducted with the software package BioNumerics \n\nv6.6 (Applied Maths, Belgium). The matrix containing both band position and intensity \n\nwas processed in a spreadsheet and transformed into relative abundance. The relative \n\nabundance matrix was log10 (x+1) transformed, and a distance matrix was constructed \n\nwith the Bray Curtis similarity values. Distance values were used to ordinate profiles by \n\nnonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis using PRIMER 6 software. \n\nEnvironmental variables, namely pH, organic matter, moisture, % fines and \n\nhydrocarbon concentration were fit in NMDS community composition analysis using a \n\nPearson correlation. The distance based linear models (DistLM) was carried out to \n\nidentify correlations between measured sediment parameters and the composition of \n\nendophytic community. For the initial marginal test, the AIC (Akaike Information \n\nCriterion) was selected, basing the analysis on the Bray-Curtis resemblance measure \n\nafter square root transformation of the abundance data. A two-way permutational \n\nanalysis of variance (perMANOVA) was used to analyze the differences in endophytic \n\ncommunity composition and gene copy number between plant species and sampling \n\nsites.  \n\nThe amino acid sequences deduced of PAH dioxygenase genes fragments were \n\naligned to their closest relatives. A phylogenetic tree was then constructed using the \n\nNeighbor-joining algorithm applied gamma distribution to a Jones-Taylor-Thornton \n\n(JTT) model and bootstrapping (500 repetitions) analysis using the Molecular \n\nEvolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA5) software.  \n\n \n\n\n\nEndophytic with degradative hydrocarbon potential \n\n68 \n\n \n\nResults and Discussion \n\nEnvironmental variables and endophytic community composition  \n\nThe location of the sampling sites within the complex estuarine system of Ria de \n\nAveiro influenced the physical-chemical properties of the sediment, such as organic \n\nmatter content and OH concentration (Table 3.2). According to the total concentration \n\nof aromatic (16 PAHs) and aliphatic PH, site B is the least (5.86 ng gram-1 dry weight) \n\nand site C the most contaminated site (21.39 ng g-1 dw). Sites A and D showed similar \n\nlevels of contamination with intermediary values (11.05 and 11.47 ng g-1 dw, \n\nrespectively). Site C is more exposed to anthropogenic activities (recreational \n\nnavigation, urban runoff and shipping activity), while site A is located in the same main \n\nchannel but with lower influence of the Port of Aveiro. Site B is not exposed to direct \n\ncontamination as it is located in a secondary channel, and finally, site D is also located \n\nnear a secondary channel but is exposed to the influence of industrial activities. \n\n \n\nTable 3.2.

Strong dependence on sediment parameters was observed in the endophytic \n\ncommunity composition of H. portulacoides and S. perennis subsp. perennis plants, \n\nexplaining 63% and 71% of variation, respectively. Using AIC to find the simplest \n\ncombination of sediment parameters which best explained the bacterial assemblage \n\n\n\nEndophytic with degradative hydrocarbon potential \n\n69 \n\n \n\npatterns, pH, log (? 16PAHs) and organic matter were identified as the best fit model, \n\nexplaining 51 % of variation in H. portulacoides plants and 58 % of variation in S. \n\nperennis subsp. perennis plant. In agreement with our results, Gomes et al (2007, 2008, \n\n2013) provided evidences that the degree of sediment contamination and especially the \n\ntype of pollutants present can influence the structure of bacterial communities \n\ninhabiting estuarine sediments. Soil properties, such as pH and organic matter \n\n(Marschner et al., 2001; Jung et al., 2008; Afzal et al., 2011), are also important drivers \n\nin the process of bacterial colonization in rhizosphere microhabitats. However, there is a \n\nlack of information about the influence of the parameters evaluated in this study on the \n\nestuarine endophytic communities. \n\n \n\nPlant species effects on endophytic bacterial communities \n\nThe endophytic bacterial assemblage patterns inferred from DGGE analyses were \n\nordinated using NMDS (Fig. 3.2A and 2B). With exception of sites A and C in S. \n\nperennis, the NMDS ordination revealed significant changes in the composition of \n\nbacterial communities from different plant species [two-way perMANOVA (p &lt;0.001)] \n\n(data not shown). Plant effects on the microbial community in surrounding sediments \n\ncan be species specific (Berg &amp; Smalla 2009). Root morphology and exudates are \n\nknown drivers in the process of rhizosphere colonization by soil bacteria (Marschner et \n\nal., 2001; Berg &amp; Smalla 2009; Bais et al., 2006) and may be expected to contribute for \n\nin planta colonization of endophytic bacteria. Root exudates, more specifically, may \n\ncontain various molecules that are structurally related to several environmental \n\npollutants (e.g. PAHs) with potential to enhance soil bacteria carrying catabolic \n\npathways for aromatic compounds (Shaw &amp; Burns 2003). A previous study (Oliveira et \n\nal., 2012) provided evidences that H. portulacoides and S. maritima root systems may \n\ncontribute for the release of species specific volatile compounds in their root exudates. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nEndophytic with degradative hydrocarbon potential \n\n70 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 3.2 NMDS showing the comparison between DGGE fingerprints of endophytic \n\ncommunities from two different plants, Halimione portulacoides (A) and Sarcocornia \n\nperennis subsp. perennis (B), along a gradient of hydrocarbons contamination.  \n\n \n\nPAH dioxygenase genes in total endophytic communities  \n\nGenes encoding for PAH dioxygenase were present in members of the endophytic \n\ncommunities found in the roots of H. portulacoides and S. perennis subsp. perennis, \n\nindicating a potential metabolic capacity of endophytic bacteria for degradation of PH. \n\nIn this study, different sets of primers for detection of genes encoding for PAH \n\ndegrading enzymes were used. The sequence analyses showed that the majority of genes \n\ndetected in endophytic communities were closely related to the nahAc gene. \n\nInterestingly, some genotypes showed plant-species-specific association (Table 3.S1). \n\nAlthough catabolic genes associated with hydrocarbon degradation are considered to be \n\nwidespread, some genotypes can show specific associations with some plant species \n\n(Phillips et al., 2008). Other studies have shown that specific catabolic genotypes are \n\nplant species dependent, although also influenced by environmental factors (Siciliano et \n\nal., 2001, C\u00e9bron et al., 2009, Ding et al., 2010). The results obtained in this study \n\nindicate that the abundance of genes encoding for PAH ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase \n\nin the endophytic communities tend to show differences between plant species and \n\nsampling sites (Fig. 3.3). Gene copy numbers were highest in plants located in more \n\ncontaminated sites (C and D). However, perMANOVA analysis did not confirm \n\nsignificant differences between sites. A similar plant/contaminant-dependent selection \n\nof different catabolic genotypes in endophytic populations was observed in Scirpus \n\nA B \n\n\n\nEndophytic with degradative hydrocarbon potential \n\n71 \n\n \n\npungens and Festuca arundinacea after experimental soil contamination with \n\nnitroaromatics and petroleum (Siciliano et al.,  2001).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 3.3 Quantification of PAH-RDH? GN gene copy number contained in endophytic \n\ncommunity in a gradient of hydrocarbons contamination (mean value \u00b1 STD, n = 4). \n\n \n\nThe preponderance of the factors related either to plant attributes or to sediment \n\nproperties may be difficult to decide. However, a study about the diversity of ndo genes \n\nin rhizosphere of two vascular plants growing in Antarctic soils revealed that the \n\nselection of ndo genotypes was more related to the contamination than to the influence \n\nof plants (Flocco et al., 2009). Also, the effects are most likely interdependent. It has \n\nbeen demonstrated that plant growth can be affected by soil characteristics (soil type, \n\nparticle sizes and organic matter content) which also influence microbial colonization \n\nand activity, and subsequently the efficiency of contaminant degradation (Afzal et al., \n\n2011).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nEndophytic with degradative hydrocarbon potential \n\n72 \n\n \n\nTable 3.3 Endophytic bacterial isolates from enrichment cultures of H. portulacoides \n\nand S. perennis subsp. perennis roots. \n\n  Sample ID \nSequence \nacession n\u00ba.a 16S rRNA Identity \n\n% \nSimilarity \n\nAcession \nn\u00ba.b \n\nHalimione portulacoides     \n\n     \nNaphthalene \n\n    \n\n \n1 KF135227 Pseudomonas sp.  99 JX047434 \n\n \n3 KF135228 Sphingobium yanoikuyae 100 JX122496 \n\n \n5 KF135229 Pseudomonas sp. 99 EF627998 \n\n \n6 KF135230 Moraxellaceae 100 JF947030 \n\n \n7 KF135231 Pseudomonas rhodesiae 99 JX994152 \n\n \n8 KF135232 Micrococcus sp. 99 JQ396588 \n\n \n9 KF135233 Sphingobium sp. 99 JQ433940 \n\n \n9a KF135234 Pseudomonas sp.  100 EF628000 \n\n \n11 KF135235 Pseudomonas sp.  100 AF411853 \n\n \n13 KF135236 Pseudomonas sp. 99 HF679142 \n\n   \nDiesel oil    \n\n \n36 KF135237 Pseudomonas rhodesiae  100 JX994152  \n\n \n40 KF135238 Pantoea dispersa  99 JN835497 \n\n \n42 KF135239 Pseudomonas sp.  100 AB772943 \n\nSarcocornia perennis subsp. perennis \n\n    \nNaphthalene \n\n   \n\n \n15 KF135240 Microbacterium sp. 99 JN942146 \n\n \n17 KF135241 Pseudomonas sp. 99 EU306338 \n\n \n18 KF135242 Pseudomonas putida 100 JQ824856 \n\n \n19 KF135243 Pseudomonas sp. 100 GU966669  \n\n \n21 KF135244 Acinetobacter sp. 97 HM755663 \n\n \n24 KF135245 Pseudomonas sp. 100 AY332207 \n\n \n25 KF135246 Ochrobactrum sp. 99 JQ821380 \n\n \n26 KF135247 Pseudomonas sp.  100 JN033360 \n\n \n27 KF135248 Microbacterium sp. 100 AB733571 \n\n \n29 KF135249 Pseudomonas stutzeri 99 EU167940 \n\n \n31 KF135250 Pseudomonas sp.  100 EF628000 \n\n \n35 KF135251 Pseudomonas putida 100 JQ619028 \n\n   \nDiesel oil    \n  49  KF135252 Pseudomonas sp.  100 JN033360 \n\na GenBank sequence accession numbers of the respective isolate \nb GenBank sequence accession numbers of the most related bacterial sequence \n\n\n\nEndophytic with degradative hydrocarbon potential \n\n73 \n\n \n\nEndophytic bacteria enriched in selective cultures  \n\nFifty putative hydrocarbonoclastic endophytic bacterial strains were isolated from \n\nselective cultures. After BOX-PCR typing, twenty-six isolates were selected as clone \n\nrepresentatives. Their 16S rRNA gene sequences showed 98-100% similarity to known \n\ngenes deposited in the GenBank database and closely related with organisms obtained \n\nfrom polluted sites (Table 3.3). Sequence analysis of these strains revealed a great \n\npredominance of Gram-negative bacteria, particularly Pseudomonas sp. Only few \n\nendophytic Gram-positive bacteria were isolated (Table 3.3). The predominance of \n\nGammaproteobacteria, mainly Pseudomonas sp., is consistent with previous \n\nobservations of this group associated to the degradation of hydrocarbons (Ma et al., \n\n2006) in rhizospheres as well as in root endophytic communities (Phillips et al. 2008; \n\nTaghavi et al., 2009; Yousaf et al., 2010b). Sphingobium, Acinetobacter, \n\nMicrobacterium, Micrococcus and Ochrobactrum were also found among the isolates. \n\nIn a similar work, twenty-one PAH degrading bacteria strains isolated from Antarctic \n\nsoils were identified as Pseudomonas and associated to PAH degradation (Ma et al., \n\n2006). Sphingobium sp. is reported as a common PAH degrader in soils (Cunliffe &amp; \n\nKertesz 2006) and Acinetobacter sp., in association with other bacteria, is also involved \n\nin the degradation of a variety of PAHs (Yu et al., 2005). Crude-oil-degrading strains of \n\nMicrobacterium are also described in the literature (Schippers et al., 2005), and two \n\nMicrococcus strains capable of growing on a mixture of naphthalene and phenanthrene \n\nwere isolated from soil near an oil refinery (Ashok et al., 1995). Ochrobactrum is also \n\nreported as able to grow on a variety of PAHs, namely phenanthrene, pyrene, \n\nfluoranthene and benzo[a]pyrene (Wu et al., 2009). \n\n \n\nPAH genes and BHR plasmids in endophytic isolates  \n\nIn this work, three sets of primer were used to target genes encoding for PAH \n\ndegradation in endophytic strains (Table 3.S2). These genes were only detected in few \n\nisolates and mainly in cultures obtained from naphthalene enrichments. In general, the \n\nisolation of microorganisms capable of growing on naphthalene is widely documented \n\n(Widada et al., 2002). In selective cultures containing diesel oil as carbon source, genes \n\nencoding for PAH degradation were only detected on three Pseudomonas isolates. This \n\nmay be related to the fact that diesel oil represents a more diverse carbon source, \n\n\n\nEndophytic with degradative hydrocarbon potential \n\n74 \n\n \n\ncontaining a small fraction of naphthalene and a range of aromatic and aliphatic \n\nhydrocarbons that may be used by different and specialized metabolic pathways (Ciric \n\net al., 2010). \n\nThe use of culturable fractions of the endophytic communities as retrieved from the \n\nselective cultures might also explain the differences in gene prevalence. In a study \n\nconducted in mangrove microniches, the composition of the original community of the \n\nmicroniches determined the structural and functional diversity of the PAH degrading \n\nenrichments (Gomes et al., 2010a).  \n\nThe phylogenetic tree of the predicted amino acid sequences of gene fragments \n\nencoding for PAH dioxygenase from endophytic isolates shows a close phylogenetic \n\nrelationship with the large ?-subunit of naphthalene dioxygenase belonging to the \n\nnahAc genotypes described for Pseudomonas species and/or plasmids associated with \n\nthis genus (Fig. 3.4, 3.5). In Figure 3.4, the amino acid sequence retrieved from the \n\nthree strains (protocol 1) is closely related to archetypal nahAc gene sequences of \n\nPseudomonas-associated plasmids (sequences identity within the group 73%).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 3.4 Phylogenetic relations of amino acid sequences of genes encoding PAH \n\ndegradation enzymes detected in bacterial isolates using protocol 1. The sequences were \n\naligned with related sequences retrieved from GenBank. \n\n \n\nThe protocol 2 detected genes encoding for PAH degradation closely related to the \n\nnahAc gene previously described for Pseudomonas sp. LCY18 and Pseudomonas \n\nassociated plasmid (Fig. 3.5). The occurrence of nah-like genotypes carried by PAH \n\ndegrading bacteria have been reported in isolates from enrichment cultures with \n\nnaphthalene or phenanthrene as carbon source (Ma et al., 2006) and in the rhizosphere \n\n\n\nEndophytic with degradative hydrocarbon potential \n\n75 \n\n \n\nof two plants growing in Maritime Antarctic (Flocco et al., 2009). A succession of \n\ndifferent genes encoding PAH dioxygenase was found in PAH-contaminated \n\nenvironments, and a dominance of nah-like genotypes occurred after enrichment with \n\nnaphthalene (Chadhain et al., 2006). Moreover, our results indicate that different genes \n\nencoding for PAH degradation occur when exposed to different PAHs in culture \n\nmedium. The results obtained in this work underline the potential environmental \n\nimportance of nah genotypes in the process of PAH degradation by bacterial \n\nendophytes in salt marsh plants. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 3.5 Phylogenetic relations of amino acid sequences of genes encoding PAH \n\ndegradation enzymes detected in bacterial isolates using the set of primers of protocol 2. \n\nThe sequences were aligned with related sequences retrieved from GenBank. \n\n \n\nHorizontal gene transfer mediated by catabolic plasmids plays an important role in \n\nthe adaptation of microbial communities to chemical stress in polluted environments \n\n(Dennis 2005). For this reason, in this study, the potential role of BHR plasmids (IncP-\n\n1, IncP-7 and IncP-9) in the process of horizontal transfer of genes encoding PAH \n\ndioxygenase was investigated (Table 3.S2). A total of 18 isolates, all from the selective \n\ncultures containing naphthalene, carried IncP-9 plasmids (Table 3.S2). However, IncP-1 \n\nand IncP-7 plasmids were not detected. IncP-9 catabolic plasmids belong to a known \n\ngroup of self-transmissible plasmids that often encode enzymes involved in the process \n\n\n\nEndophytic with degradative hydrocarbon potential \n\n76 \n\n \n\nof PH degradation. In this study, sequence fragments obtained from genes encoding for \n\nPAH dioxygenase in plasmids exhibited high similarity with the nahAc gene of plasmid \n\nFKY4, a IncP-9 self-transmissible plasmid able to transfer the ability to degrade \n\nnaphthalene to other bacterial cells (Ono et al., 2007) (Fig. 3.5). Our results indicate that \n\nthis plasmid may be involved in the spread of nah genotypes between salt marsh plants \n\nin the estuary studied. \n\n \n\nConclusions \n\nThis study assessed the potential effects of petrogenic hydrocarbon contamination \n\non the structural and functional diversity of endophytic bacteria in two salt marsh plant \n\nspecies. The results showed that plant species and sediment properties are likely \n\ninteracting in the modulation of the endophytic bacterial communities and in their \n\ngenetic determinants for OH degradation, like genes and plasmids. Furthermore, plant-\n\nspecies-specific \u201cimprints\u201d were confirmed in the composition of genes encoding for \n\nPAH degradation. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, the culturable fraction of \n\nendophytic degraders was essentially close related to known PAH-degrading \n\nPseudomonas species. The prevalence of nah genotypes and the detection of catabolic \n\nplasmids in salt marsh plants indicate that horizontal gene transfer can drive the spread \n\nof nah genes in these habitats and probably contribute to the process of bacterial \n\nendophytic adaptation and in planta OH decontamination. Moreover, nah genes are \n\ncommonly associated with hydrocarbon degrading species belonging to the genus \n\nPseudomonas. Overall, the results suggest that the adaptation to OH contamination goes \n\nbeyond the rhizosphere communities and extends to endophytic bacteria tightening the \n\nrelations established between plants and microbes in response to OH contamination.  \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThis work had financial support from CESAM research unit (PEst-\n\nC/MAR/LA0017/2011), QOPNA research unit (project PEst-C/QUI/UI0062/2011), \n\nPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) project PTDC/AAC-\n\nCLI/107916/2008 (http://alfa.fct.mctes.pt) and COMPETES-(FCOMP-01-0124-\n\nFEDER-008657).

In this study, a factorial microcosm approach \n\nwas used to investigate the response of the salt marsh halophyte Halimione \n\nportulacoides to contamination with 2-methylnaphthalene. The effect of inoculation \n\nwith indigenous endophytic hydrocarbon degrading bacterium Pseudomonas sp. was \n\nalso assessed. During the experiments, plant photosynthetic performance was monitored \n\nby Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM) fluorometry, the structural diversity and function \n\nof bacterial communities were assessed by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis \n\n(DGGE) analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, and the detection of polycyclic \n\naromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) dioxygenase genes was attempted. The clearance of the \n\nadded hydrocarbon was evaluated by chemical analysis of the sediments.  \n\nThe endophytic and rhizosphere communities exhibited different responses to \n\ninoculation and/or to 2-methylnaphthalene amendment. The inoculation had a positive \n\nimpact in plant photophysiology but it did not cause a significant change in the plant \n\nhealth responses to hydrocarbon exposure. The addition of 2-methylnaphthalene \n\nincreased the frequency of genes encoding for the large subunit of naphthalene-1,2-\n\ndioxygenase (nahAc) in sediment bacteria (with and without inoculation). \n\nThese results do not demonstrate a significant effect of the inoculation with an \n\nendophytic hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria on the overall hydrocarbon degradation \n\npotential of the salt marsh halophyte Halimione portulacoides, under the moderate PAH \n\nconcentrations of the experiment. However, the effect of the inoculant on the structure \n\nof the indigenous endophytic community indicates that the strain used in this study is a \n\ngood plant colonizer and may be regarded as promising candidate for microbe-assisted \n\nphytoremediation approaches. \n\n \n\n\n\nPlant-microbe interactions in 2-methylnaphthalene contaminated sediments \n \n\n82 \n\n \n\nKeywords: endophytic; H. portulacoides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, \n\nphytoremediation \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\nEstuarine areas are very susceptive to contamination by oil hydrocarbons, mainly \n\nbecause they are often located in the vicinity of urban and industrialize areas. \n\nPetroleum-derived, such as, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), are of particular \n\nimportance due to their ubiquity, toxicity and persistence (Haritash &amp; Kaushik, 2009). \n\nRemoval techniques are being applied to water and sediment in the attempt to restore \n\nenvironmental quality, with a preponderance of in situ methods which are more efficient \n\nand cost-effective (Alkorta &amp; Garbisu, 2001).  \n\nPhytoremediation as the use of vegetation to enhance degradation and removal of \n\ncontaminants in soil, sediments and groundwater has emerged as the best natural \n\ntechnology alternative (Escalante-Espinosa et al., 2005, Moreira et al., 2011). \n\nSuccessful application rely on a variety of factors, such as the type and quantity of \n\ncontaminant, performance of particular plant species or physical and chemical \n\ncharacteristics of the contaminated area (EPA, 200, Alkorta &amp; Garbisu, 2001). The salt \n\nmarsh vegetation is dominated by halophytes that have the capacity to tolerate high salt \n\nconcentration (Flowers &amp; Colmer, 2008) and their potential as \n\nbioindicators/biomonitors of contamination (Anjum et al., 2013) or in the clean-up of \n\npetroleum hydrocarbon contamination have been studied (Oliveira &amp; Mendelssohn, \n\n2009, Al-Mailem et al., 2010, Couto et al., 2011, Ribeiro et al., 2013). Plants exudates \n\n(e.g, sugars, organic acids and vitamins) enhance microbial activity promoting \n\nhydrocarbon reduction in contaminant areas. Therefore, one of the mechanisms \n\nresponsible for phytoremedition is the increase of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria \n\npopulations containing catabolic genes responsible for hydrocarbon degradation \n\n(Siciliano et al., 2002).  \n\nThe stimulation of indigenous microorganisms capable of degrading pollutants or \n\nthe addition of engineered microorganisms to enhance biodegradation has been reported \n\n(Barac et al., 2004, Germaine et al., 2009, Afzal et al., 2013). Pseudomonas species \n\nhave been shown to be capable to degrade a range of organic pollutants, including PAH, \n\n\n\nPlant-microbe interactions in 2-methylnaphthalene contaminated sediments \n \n\n83 \n\n \n\nhalogenated derivates and recalcitrant organic residues (Bhattacharya et al., 2003), and \n\nwere frequently reported in PAH-impacted environments (Ma et al., 2006, Coelho et al., \n\n2011, Dubinsky et al., 2013, Oliveira et al., 2014).  \n\nHalimione portulacoides (L) Allen, a low perennial shrub of the Chenopodiaceae \n\nfamily, highly abundant in salt marshes along the Atlantic coast of Europe (Waisel, \n\n2012), is a promising species for the application of phytoremediation in salt marsh \n\nsediments.  H. portulacoides has been the subject of a variety of studies due to its \n\npotential to accumulate several metals (Cacador et al., 2009, Valega et al., 2009, Anjum \n\net al., 2011), and is also a good candidate to use in phytoremediation of hydrocarbon \n\ncontamination areas. In this study, 2-methylnaphthalene was used as model of \n\nhydrocarbon sediment contamination. Naphthalene is the simplest and most widespread \n\nenvironmental pollutant member of the chemical family of polycyclic aromatic \n\nhydrocarbons (PAHs) and its methyl-substituted derivate is among the most toxic \n\ncomponents in crude and fuel oils (Mahajan et al., 1994).  \n\nThe objective of this study was to test, under controlled microcosms conditions, if \n\nthe inoculation of H. portulacoides with a hydrocarbon-degrading bacterium would \n\nmitigate the negative effects of the exposure of plants to hydrocarbon contamination. \n\n \n\nMaterial and Methods \n\nSamples of Halimione portulacoides were collected from an estuarine system (Ria \n\nde Aveiro, Portugal, 40\u00ba36\u2019N, 08\u00ba45\u2019W) during late autumn. In order to obtain grafts of \n\nH. portulacoides, stems with leaves were cut in small pieces (aprox. 6-8 cm) that were \n\nplaced in bottles with \u00bc Hoagland nutrient solution with the following composition: 1.5 \n\nmM KNO3, 1 mM Ca (NO3)2, 0.5 mM NH4H2PO4, 0.25 mM MgSO4.7H2O, 50 mM \n\nKCl, 25 mM H3BO3, 2 mM MnSO4. H2O, 2 mM ZnSO4.7H2O, 0.5 mM CuSO4.5H2O, \n\n0.5 mM (NH4)6 Mo7O24.4H2O and 20 mM FeNaEDTA (Duarte et al., 2007). The plants \n\nwere kept at room temperature under natural light for approximately five months in \n\norder to allow the development of new root biomass. Test-sediment was collected from \n\nthe same site sieved through 2.00 mm. The sediment had a moisture capacity of \n\n22.47%, organic matter content of 4.25% and a pH 7.12. The sediment texture \n\ncorresponds to mud with 58% of fines (Oliveira et al., 2014). \n\n\n\nPlant-microbe interactions in 2-methylnaphthalene contaminated sediments \n \n\n84 \n\n \n\nThe experimental design was randomized, with grafts divided in 4 treatments: \n\ncontrol (Ctl \u2013 sediment with plants); sediment with inoculated plant (I); sediment \n\ncontaminated with 2-methylnaphthalene and with plant (MtN); sediment contaminated \n\nwith 2-methylnaphthalene and with inoculated plant (MtN_I). The experiment was \n\nconducted for eight weeks.  \n\n \n\nTreatments  \n\nIn order to simulate PAH contamination, sediments (MtN and MtN_I) were spiked \n\nwith 2-methylnaphthalene (final concentration 10 \u00b5 g g-1). To achieve a uniform spiking, \n\n2-methylnaphthalene was dissolved in acetone and added to 1/4 of total sediment. The \n\nacetone was allowed to evaporate overnight. The contaminated sediment (1/4) was well \n\nmixed with additional sediment (3/4) (Brannock, 2004). Each container took 150 g of \n\nsediment. \n\n Pseudomonas sp. SN31 strain was obtained after enrichment with 10 mg of 2-\n\nmethylnaphthalene crystals as the sole carbon source as described in a previous study \n\n(Oliveira et al., 2014). The 16S rDNA ribosomal sequence used to identify the isolate is \n\navailable at the GenBank under the accession number: EF628000. Before planting, the \n\nplant grafts were divided in two sets. In one, plants were treated with freshly grown \n\nPseudomonas sp. SN31 cells (107) by dipping the roots in a 0.85% NaCl solution, over \n\n72 h. In other set the roots were dipped only in sterile NaCl solution (Fig. 4.S1).  \n\nFinally, plants were transferred to PAH-spiked or control sediment and maintained \n\nunder natural light and room temperature. During the course of the experiment, two \n\ndays per week all treatments were subjected to irrigation with Hoagland\u00b4s solution (Fig. \n\n4.S2).   \n\n \n\nQuantification of 2-methylnaphthalene \n\nSediment was analyzed for 2-methylnaphthalene using a Soxhlet extraction \n\nfollowed by a GC-MS analysis. Four sediment samples of each treatment were \n\nhomogenized and freeze-dried before extraction. Deutorated naphthalene-d8 surrogate \n\nstandard was added to sediment samples to monitor the procedures of sample extraction, \n\ncleanup and analysis. In a Soxhlet apparatus 5 g dried and homogenized sediment \n\n\n\nPlant-microbe interactions in 2-methylnaphthalene contaminated sediments \n \n\n85 \n\n \n\ntreatment was extracted with 150 ml dicloromethane. Prior to extraction, the sediment \n\nwas spiked with 25 \u00b5 l (2 \u00b5 g/ml) deuterated recovery surrogate standard (naphthalene-\n\nd8). Activated copper (Schubert et al., 1998) were added to the collection flask to avoid \n\nsulfur interferences when using mass chromatography. After extraction, the sample \n\nextracts were concentrated by rotary evaporation up to a volume of about 2-3 ml, and \n\nchange solvent into 10 ml n-hexane which further reduce to approximately 1-2 ml. The \n\nconcentrated hexane extract with 2-methylnaphthalene was separated using a 2:1 \n\nalumina/silica gel column with anhydrous sodium sulfate overlaying the alumina \n\n(remove small quantities of water). This column was used to clean-up and fractionate \n\nthe extract. Elution was performed using 15 ml of hexane to yield the first fraction and \n\nfollowed by 30 ml of dicloromethane/hexane (1:1). The sample volume was reduced to \n\n1 ml by rotary vacuum evaporator and further to 0.2 ml with a gentle purified nitrogen \n\nstream. A known quantity (2 mg/ml) of the internal standard, hexamethylbenzene, was \n\nadded prior to GC-MS. GC-MS analysis was carried using an Agilent Network GC \n\nsystem, namely an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a mass selective \n\ndetector (MSD 5973) in the selective ion mode (SIM). The 2-methylnaphthalene was \n\nseparated using a VF-5MS fused silica column (30 m x 0.25 mm i.d and 0.25 \u00b5 m film \n\nthickness). GC/MS operating conditions were as follows: injector and transfer-line \n\ntemperatures were maintained at 300 \u00baC. The oven temperature programmed was \n\ninitially isothermal at 60 \u00baC for 1 min, increased to 200 \u00baC at a rate of 10 \u00baC/min (hold \n\nfor 2 min), and then kept isothermal at 300 \u00baC for 3 min with a rate of 20 \u00baC/min. \n\nHelium as the carried gas a flow rate of 1.3 mL min-1.  A 1 \u00b5 L sample was manually \n\ninjected in the splitless mode with a 1 min solvent delay. The mass spectra of 2-\n\nmethylnaphthalene was acquired at the electron impact (EI) mode at 70 eV. The mass \n\nscanning ranged between m/? 20 and m/? 500. The naphthalene-d8 surrogate recovery \n\nwas 90 \u00b1 6 %. \n\n \n\nPhotosynthetic performance  \n\nChlorophyll a fluorescence was monitored by PAM fluorometry as an indicator of \n\nphotosynthetic performance, using an imaging chlorophyll fluorometer (Open \n\nFluorCAM 800-O/1010; Photon Systems Instruments). The equipment comprises a \n\n\n\nPlant-microbe interactions in 2-methylnaphthalene contaminated sediments \n \n\n86 \n\n \n\ncomputer-operated control unit (SN-FC800-082, PSI), an 2/3\u201d CCD camera (CCD381, \n\nPSI) attached to an F1.2 (2.8-6 mm) objective (Eneo) and four 13 x 13 cm LED panels \n\nemitting red light (emission peak at 621 nm, 40 nm bandwidth). Two LED panels \n\n(MLS13x13-016A/B) provided the modulated measuring light (&lt;0.1 \u00b5 mol m-2 s-1) and \n\nthe other two (SL3500-179/180) provided saturating pulses (> 7500 \u00b5 mol m-2 s-1, 0.6 s). \n\nChlorophyll a fluorescence was filtered using a filter system (composed by a high pass \n\nfilter (695 nm) and a low pass filter (780 nm) and images (12 bit, 512 x 512 pixels) \n\nwere captured and processed using FluorCam7 software (Photon Systems Instruments). \n\nExperimental procedure was carried out under the control of user-defined automated \n\nmeasuring sequences (protocols) with the ability to define measurement intervals and \n\nirradiance (Nedbal et al., 2000). For each treatment, five replicate of H. portulacoides \n\nleaves under the same experimental conditions were dark adapted for 5 minutes, before \n\nthe maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) could be measured (Fv/Fm). A \n\nuser defined protocol, with a total duration of 2s, was used to estimate Fv/Fm and \n\nallowed minimum fluorescence (Fo), to be measured for 1,4 seconds and then a 600 ms \n\nlight saturating pulse (SP) was applied, which allowed the determination of maximum \n\nfluorescence (Fm) values. Fv/Fm was calculated following Kitajima &amp; Butler (1975). \n\nAfter the estimation of Fv/Fm, rapid light-response curves (RLCs) were performed \n\nimmediately on the same samples. RLCs were built using 14 increasing actinic light \n\nsteps, from 53 to 1531 \u00b5 mol m-2 s-1, with each light step taking 10 sec, after which an \n\nSP was applied, allowing the estimation of steady state fluorescence (Fs) and maximum \n\nlight-adapted fluorescence (Fm\u2019) for each light step. The relative electron transport rate \n\n(rETR) was calculated for each light step, as rETR = [(Fm\u2019- Fs)/Fm]\u2019*PAR, with (Fm\u2019- \n\nFs)/Fm, being the PSII effective quantum yield (Genty et al., 1990). Light curve \n\nparameters, such as ? (initial slope), rETRm (maximum rETR) and Ek (light-saturation \n\nparameter) where quantified by fitting the model of Eilers &amp; Peeters (1988), using the \n\nMS Excel Solver.  \n\n \n\nTotal community DNA (TC-DNA) extraction \n\nFour samples of 0.5 g of rhizosphere sediments were subject to TC-DNA extraction \n\nusing a MoBio UltracleanTM soil DNA kit (Cambio) following the manufacturer\u00b4s \n\n\n\nPlant-microbe interactions in 2-methylnaphthalene contaminated sediments \n \n\n87 \n\n \n\ninstruction. The endophytic community was recovered from fresh roots. Root material \n\nwas vigorously washed in distilled water (5 min) and root surface was disinfected by \n\nsequential washing with 95% ethanol and 1% sodium hypochlorite supplemented with \n\none droplet Tween 80, and rinsed three times in sterile distilled water (Barac et al., \n\n2004). A 100 \u00b5 L sample of final rinsing water was spread-plated on 869 medium \n\n(Mergeay et al., 1985) to check the efficiency of disinfection. The endophytic TC-DNA \n\nextraction was performed using a bead-beating protocol previously described in \n\n(Phillips et al., 2006). About 2 g of surface disinfected root material was macerated in \n\nliquid nitrogen. The cell lysis was achieved by a combination of bead-beating, \n\nproteinase K (20 mg mL-1) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (20%). Procedures cellular \n\ndebris and proteins were precipitated with aqueous 7.5 M ammonium acetate. DNA was \n\nsubsequently precipitated with isopropanol, washed with 70% cold ethanol and re-\n\nsuspended in 50 \u00b5 L TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA; pH 8.0). The \n\nendophytic TC-DNA was purified with the GeneClean Spin Kit (MP Biomedicals). \n\n \n\nPCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene fragments and denaturing gradient gel \n\nelectrophoresis (DGGE) \n\nA nested PCR approach was used to amplify the 16S rRNA gene sequence from \n\nrhizosphere sediments and endophytic communities (Gomes et al., 2008). Briefly, in the \n\nfirst PCR the universal bacterial primers U27 and 1492R were used. The amplicons \n\nobtained was used as template for a second PCR with the bacterial DGGE primers \n\n984F-GC and 1378R (Heuer et al., 1997). PCR proceeding and amplification conditions \n\nwere described in (Oliveira et al., 2014). \n\nThe GC-clamped amplicons were applied to a double-gradient polyacrylamide gel \n\ncontaining 6\u201310% acrylamide with a gradient of 40\u201358% of denaturants. The run was \n\nperformed in Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer at 60 \u00b0C at a constant voltage of 80 V for 16 h \n\nusing the DCode System (Universal Mutation Detection System, Bio-Rad). The DGGE \n\ngels were silver stained (Heuer et al., 2001). The processing of the scanned DGGE gels \n\nwas carried out using the Bionumerics software 6.6 (Applied Maths). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPlant-microbe interactions in 2-methylnaphthalene contaminated sediments \n \n\n88 \n\n \n\nDetection of genes encoding for PAH degradation  \n\nThe presence of genes encoding the large subunit of naphthalene-1,2-dioxygenase \n\n(nahAc) and alpha subunit of the PAH ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases genes, both \n\nrelated to PAH degradation, was detected by PCR using the primers and reaction \n\nconditions described by Wilson et al. (1999) and C\u00e9bron et al. (2008), respectively and \n\nsummarized in Oliveira et al., (2014). \n\n \n\nStatistical analysis \n\nAfter analysis of DGGE gels the data matrix of band abundance (band positions and \n\ntheir corresponding intensities) per sample was log10 (x + 1) transformed and a distance \n\nmatrix was constructed using the Bray-Curtis index with the vegdist() function in the \n\nvegan package (Oksanen et al., 2011) in R version 3.0.1 (http://www.r-project.org/; \n\nchecked 2013/09/13). Variation in bacterial composition as response to different \n\ntreatments in rhizosphere sediments and root endophytic communities was visually \n\nassessed with Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCO) using the cmdscale() function in R \n\nusing the Bray-Curtis distance matrix as input. Significant differences between \n\ntreatments in the communities of different microhabitats were tested using the adonis() \n\nfunction in vegan. The adonis() function performs an analysis of variance with distance \n\nmatrices using permutations that partition the distance matrices among sources of \n\nvariation. In the adonis() analysis, the Bray-Curtis distance matrix of band composition \n\nwas the response variable with type of treatments the independent variable. The number \n\nof permutations was set at 999; all other arguments used the default values set in the \n\nfunction. Plant fluorescence parameters and 2-methylnaphthalene concentration data \n\nwas included in an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model to determine the specific \n\neffects of each treatment. ANOVA analysis were performed using aov() function of the \n\nR. \n\n \n\nResults \n\nGrowth, maximum quantum yield of PSII and light curve parameters \n\nHalimione portulacoides grew well in both controls (non-contaminated) and 2-\n\nmethylnaphthalene contaminated sediments. At the end of experiment plants appeared \n\n\n\nPlant-microbe interactions in 2-methylnaphthalene contaminated sediments \n \n\n89 \n\n \n\nhealthy, with development of news leave and shoots (Fig. 4.S2). Fluorescence \n\nparameters were used to determine if 2-methylnaphthalene had a significant negative \n\nimpact on plant health and photophysiology (Table 4.1).

These habitats are constantly subjected \n\nto very different environmental pressures such as flooding, salinity fluctuations and \n\ncontamination with organic and inorganic compounds. Considering that hydrocarbon \n\npollution has severe effects on salt marsh vegetation, the main goal of this study was to \n\ndetermine whether the inoculation of a salt marsh halophyte with a hydrocarbon-\n\ndegrading bacterial strain could improve its overall degradation potential without \n\naffective its health status.  \n\n \n\nPlant condition \n\nSeveral studies have reported significant reduction of the growth of salt marsh \n\nplants subjected to high petroleum hydrocarbons dosage (Mendelssohn et al., 1990, Lin \n\n&amp; Mendelssohn, 1996, Pezeshki et al., 2000, Lin &amp; Mendelssohn, 2009). Nevertheless, \n\nthe type, quantity and time of exposure of the hydrocarbon contamination may be \n\ndeterminant (Lin &amp; Mendelssohn, 1998). The tolerance limits of the salt marsh \n\nhalophyte Juncus roemerianus is estimated to be between 160 and 320 mg diesel g-1 dry \n\nsediment. Above this limit, growth can be significantly affected (Lin &amp; Mendelssohn, \n\n\n\nPlant-microbe interactions in 2-methylnaphthalene contaminated sediments \n \n\n93 \n\n \n\n2009). Although the susceptibility of Halimione portulacoides is not well characterized, \n\nplants were not significantly affected by the concentration of 10 \u00b5 g g-1 of 2-\n\nmethylnaphthalene used in this work, as revealed by the Fv/Fm descriptor of \n\nphotosynthetic efficiency. This means that quantum efficiency of the light reactions of \n\nphotosynthesis on the contaminated plants was not affected. Information on the \n\nphotosynthetic potential at different light regimes can also be inferred from the light \n\ncurve parameters, especially the rETRm. The results of this parameter indicate that there \n\nwas some variation of the photosynthetic potential during the course of the microcosm \n\nexperiments. This can be explained as an acclimation phenomenon.  \n\nIn this study, the concentration of added PAH was intentionally low in order to \n\nrepresent realistic levels of contamination in moderately polluted estuaries. The results \n\nindicate this PAH load was generally well tolerated by the plants. A study of the effect \n\nof oil contamination (range 0.3 to 2.73 L m-2) on the photosynthetic activity of \n\nSalicornia virginica produced similar results (Rosso et al., 2005) indicating that plants \n\ncan tolerate moderate concentrations of hydrocarbon without significant impairment of \n\nthe photosynthetic function. In a field trial, there was only a modest variation on the \n\nphotosynthetic rate in a group of plants subjected to petroleum contamination and \n\ninoculated with PGPR (plant growth promoting rhizobacteria) (Gurska et al., 2009). A \n\ndifferent result was obtained in a study in which the effects of oil on Spartina \n\nalterniflora photosynthesis were measured. In this case, despite a full year of recovery, \n\nplants exhibited chronic stress which depressed photosynthesis (Biber et al., 2012).  \n\n \n\nHydrocarbon clearance \n\nThe comparison of the concentration of 2-methylnaphthalene at the beginning and at \n\nthe end of the experiments shows that, in the presence of the plant, there was a 75% \n\nreduction after 8 weeks in microcosm experimentally amended with 2-\n\nmethylnaphthalene (MtN and MtN-I). Several studies have demonstrated that \n\nphytoremediation is an efficient strategy for the removal of hydrocarbons from \n\ncontaminated sediments (Taghavi et al., 2005, Lin &amp; Mendelssohn, 2009) in \n\ncomparison to other bioremediation approaches (Germaine et al., 2009, Moreira et al., \n\n2011). The increase of root biomass produces considerable amounts of exudates and \n\n\n\nPlant-microbe interactions in 2-methylnaphthalene contaminated sediments \n \n\n94 \n\n \n\nconsequently stimulates bacterial activity in the rhizosphere microhabitat, which might \n\ncontribute to enhanced OH capacity (Escalante-Espinosa et al., 2005, Moreira et al., \n\n2011). On the other hand, a study using the same plant demonstrated that H. \n\nportulacoides can interfere with the degradation of higher molecular weight PAHs by \n\nsediment microorganisms and this was interpreted as an indication of competition for \n\nnutrients between plants and microorganisms (Mucha et al., 2011).  \n\nThe fact that inoculation did not enhance 2-methylnaphthalene degradation by the \n\nplant can be related with the inoculation method or environmental factors. Other studies \n\nreport that the failure of bacteria inoculation in contaminated sites can be a matter of \n\ninoculum size (Mishra et al., 2001) or strong influence of soil characteristics, such as \n\nthe soil type, particle sizes or organic matter content (Afzal et al., 2012, Afzal et al., \n\n2013). May be the inoculant would have been more helpful if 2-methylnaphthalene \n\nconcentrations were very high. \n\n \n\nStructure of bacterial communities \n\nIn this experiment the contamination had a differentiated impact on the structure of \n\nbacterial communities, depending on the microhabitat (endophytic or rhizosphere \n\nsediments). The presence of contaminants is known to modify the composition and \n\nactivity of sediment bacterial communities (Gomes et al., 2005). Moreover, plants may \n\nenhance pollutant degradation by positively affecting the abundance, diversity and \n\nactivity of specific microorganism in the surrounding rhizosphere (Siciliano et al., 2002, \n\nMucha et al., 2011) and within plants roots (Phillips et al., 2008, Ryan et al., 2008). The \n\nresults of this work indicate that endophytic and rhizosphere communities exhibited \n\ndifferent responses to inoculation and/or to 2-methylnaphthalene amendment. The \n\nrhizosphere microbiota was more resilient and changes only occurred when two sources \n\nof variability (contamination and inoculation) were imposed. The inoculant used in this \n\nexperiment was actually isolated from the endosphere of Sarcocornia perennis subsp. \n\nperennis root in a hydrocarbon-impacted salt marsh of Ria de Aveiro (Oliveira et al., \n\n2014). Therefore, it is expectable that this strain might also be present in the roots of the \n\nplants used in this study and that the inoculation alone did not represent a significant \n\nshift in community structure. Also, the rhizosphere communities are naturally enriched \n\n\n\nPlant-microbe interactions in 2-methylnaphthalene contaminated sediments \n \n\n95 \n\n \n\nin hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (Daane et al., 2001, Ma et al., 2010, Ribeiro et al., \n\n2011) and the amendment with realistic concentrations of 2-methylnaphthalene may not \n\nrepresent a significant challenge to the rhizosphere bacterial community. However, \n\nwhen the contaminant and the contaminant-inoculum were combined, there was \n\ndetectable change in the bacterial community that could indicate a stress-relieve \n\nresponse.   \n\nThe PCO analysis of endophytic communities shows that the community reacted to \n\ncontamination and to inoculation and also to the combination of both manipulations. \n\nThese results suggest that endophytic communities are more sensitive to selective \n\npressures applied separately that can correspond to a successful competition between \n\ninoculated bacteria and indigenous endophytic bacteria for plant roots. The endophytic \n\ncommunities are unique to each plant species and differences in their distribution and \n\ndiversity can be due to plant-specific factors, metabolic pathways, nutrient availability \n\nand composition of root exudates (G\u00fcnther et al., 1996, Rosenblueth &amp; Mart\u00ednez-\n\nRomero, 2006). The amendment of an aromatic hydrocarbon causes a change in the \n\ncomposition of the endophytic community that may correspond to a selective response \n\nof particular hydrocarbon degrading strains. The relations between plant-specific \n\nfactors, composition of the endophytic bacterial community and potential for \n\nhydrocarbon degradation have already been demonstrated in prairie plants (Phillips et \n\nal., 2008). The inoculum used in the present work is a hydrocarbon endophytic \n\nbacterium (Oliveira et al., 2014). Therefore, the observed change in the endophytic \n\ncommunity in inoculated treatments suggests that the internalization of inoculant cells \n\ndid occur during the experiment, even without experimental amendment with 2-\n\nmethylnaphthalene, and that the inoculant may be a promising root colonizer.  \n\n \n\nHydrocarbon degradation genes \n\nNaphthalene dioxygenase genes, as representatives of the family of catabolic genes \n\ninvolved in hydrocarbon degradation, were analyzed to assess the hydrocarbon-\n\ndegradation potential of rhizosphere and endophytic bacterial communities. At the end \n\nof the 8-week experiment, naphthalene dioxygenase genes were only detected in 2-\n\nmethylnaphthalene treatments, and in the case of the endophytic community, in \n\n\n\nPlant-microbe interactions in 2-methylnaphthalene contaminated sediments \n \n\n96 \n\n \n\ninoculated plants. The positive detection only in contaminated sediments can be due to \n\nthe increase of naphthalene degradation genes number and the enhancement of \n\nhorizontal gene transfer in response of 2-methylnaphthalene contamination. In fact, it \n\nhas been reported that biodegradation potential is enhanced by horizontal gene transfer \n\nand development of an efficient degrading microbial community upon contamination \n\n(Top et al., 2002, Top &amp; Springael, 2003). The number of nahAc gene copies is directly \n\nrelated with the rate of naphthalene degradation (Park &amp; Crowley, 2006) and the \n\nresponse to 2-methylnaphthalene in terms of nahAc gene copy number may be \n\ninterpreted as an adaptative stress response. The fact that naphthalene degradation genes \n\nin endophytic communities were only detected in the treatment corresponding to \n\ninoculated plants in spiked sediments can be related with selection of naphthalene \n\nendophytic degraders in response to contamination.  \n\n \n\nConclusions \n\nIn conclusion, the salt mash plant H. portulacoides can influence microbial \n\ncommunities by favoring the development of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria which \n\nmay contribute to hydrocarbon clearance in salt marsh sediments. The hypothesis that \n\nthe inoculation of the plants with the PAH-degrading endophytic bacterium would \n\nenhance 2-methylnaphthalene degradation could not be demonstrated. However, the \n\ninoculation did have an impact on the structural diversity of endophytic communities. \n\nThis result indicates that this strain is a good plant colonizer. Because it carries genetic \n\ndeterminants for hydrocarbon degradation (e.g. plasmids) that can be horizontally \n\ntransferred within the community, it may represent a promising candidate for microbe-\n\nassisted phytoremediation approaches. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThis work had financial support from CESAM research unit (PEst-\n\nC/MAR/LA0017/2011), QOPNA research unit (project PEst-C/QUI/UI0062/2011), \n\nPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) project PTDC/AAC-\n\nCLI/107916/2008 (http://alfa.fct.mctes.pt) and COMPETES-(FCOMP-01-0124-\n\n\n\nPlant-microbe interactions in 2-methylnaphthalene contaminated sediments \n \n\n97 \n\n \n\nFEDER-008657).

Therefore, the relations between \n\nplants and microorganisms involved in hydrocarbon removal or degradation have for \n\nlong been followed with interest. The rhizosphere effect in the process of OH (oil \n\nhydrocarbon) degradation has been progressively recognized. However, only very few \n\nstudies have focused on the rhizosphere of salt marsh vegetation (Daane et al., 2001, \n\nMucha et al., 2011, Ribeiro et al., 2011) and practically none on the associated \n\nendophytic bacterial communities. Phytoremediation is an inexpensive and \u201cgreen\u201d \n\napproach based on the interactions between plants, their associated indigenous \n\ndegrading microorganisms (rhizo- and endosphere) and pollutants. The potential of salt \n\nmarsh halophytes to clean-up petroleum hydrocarbons contamination have been studied \n\n(Oliveira &amp; Mendelssohn, 2009, Al-Mailem et al., 2010, Couto et al., 2011, Ribeiro et \n\nal., 2013). Moreover, the use of endophytic-derived inoculants to reduce the pollutant \n\ntoxicity to plants and increase biodegradation has been demonstrated (Barac et al., \n\n2004, Taghavi et al., 2005). \n\nThe main goal of this study is the characterization of relevant plant-microbe \n\ninteractions in oil-impacted salt marshes and the understanding of the effect of \n\nrhizosphere and endosphere bacteria in the role of salt marsh plants as potential \n\nphytoremediation agents. In order to achieve the objectives, the methodological \n\napproach combined field observations with experimental manipulations, conducted in \n\nplant sediment microcosms. \n\n \n\nField work \n\nIn the field, this study addressed some general questions: How do plant species- and \n\nOH pollution affect indigenous sediment bacterial composition and degradation \n\npotential in sampling sites exposed to different levels of contamination? How do \n\nendophytic communities respond? Which genetic factors are involved in endophytic OH \n\ndegradation capacity?  \n\n\n\nConclusions \n\n101 \n\n \n\nThe shallow estuary-coastal lagoon Ria de Aveiro is composed of four main \n\nchannels that divide into an intricate network of narrow and shallow secondary cannels \n\nseparated by mud banks and salt marshes. The Aveiro long-distance port facilities are \n\ninstalled at the outer section of the estuary and elevated hydrocarbon contamination has \n\nbeen reported at this area (Pacheco &amp; Santos, 2001). Also, other antropogenic inputs, \n\nsuch as recreational navigation, urban runoff and intense commercial shipping activity, \n\ncause a continuous efflux of OH.  \n\nThe location of the four collecting points was chosen to reflect different levels of \n\nOH pollution among the areas where the two studied halophytes could be found. The \n\nhalophytes Halimione portulacoides (L.) Allen, and Sarcocornia perennis subsp. \n\nperennis (P. Mill) are widely represented in temperate estuaries and prevalent species in \n\nRia de Aveiro salt marshes (Silva et al., 2009). Both Chenopodiaceae, these species can \n\ntolerate high salinity and water potentials (Rubio-Casal et al., 2003). By playing a \n\nrelevant role in organic matter recycling and on nutrient and metal sequestration, they \n\nhave been proposed for phytoremediation approaches.  \n\nWithin the field approach, culture-dependent and -independent methods were used \n\nto investigate the effects of OH contamination on bacterial communities in salt marsh \n\nmicrohabitats (bulk sediment, rhizosphere and endosphere). The structure and \n\ncomposition of sediment bacterial communities appear to be affected by site related \n\nfactors (sediment properties and oil hydrocarbon contamination) and plant related \n\nfactors (exudates composition). Sediment properties (organic content and gran size) \n\ninfluence the bioavailability of hydrocarbons (Kim et al., 1999, Wang et al., 2001). \n\nMoreover, plants can influence the hydrocarbon retention around roots (Ribeiro et al., \n\n2011) and affect the composition of the microbial community by selecting the \n\ndevelopment of hydrocarbon-degrading microbial population in its rhizosphere. The \n\ncomposition of the root exudates released by each plant can underlie the differences of \n\ndiversity and structure of rhizosphere and endosphere communities of study plants. In a \n\nprevious work directed to volatile compounds emissions which compose a relevant \n\nfraction of root exudates (Steeghs et al., 2004), the high complexity of the chemical \n\ncomposition of root-derived material associated to salt marsh plants (Spartina maritima \n\nand Halimione portulacoides) was demonstrated, indicating that the quality and quantity \n\nof root derived organic matter may be a relevant driver of bacterial dynamics in salt \n\n\n\nConclusions \n\n102 \n\n \n\nmarsh sediments. Phillips et al., (2012), suggested that the patterns of exudation \n\nreleased by Elymus angustus (wildrye) and Medicago sativa (alfalfa) are the driving \n\nfactors behind the degradation traits of bacteria.  \n\nIn terms of degradation potential, the in silico metagenome analysis of 16 sRNA \n\ngene amplicons obtained in this study showed enrichment of genes involved in the \n\nprocess of PAH degradation in the rhizosphere of halophyte plants. The endophytic \n\ncommunity showed potential degradation capacity with the presence and abundance of \n\ngenes encoding for PAH-degrading enzymes which were plant species/contaminant \n\ndependent. \n\nEnrichment cultures of endophytic bacteria were prepared in order to obtain OH-\n\ndegrading bacterial strains with potential for later use in the microcosm experiments. \n\nThe endophytic strains retrieved revealed a predominance of Pseudomonas sp. \n\nPseudomonas is frequently isolated from oil-contaminated sediments (Ma et al., 2006, \n\nGomes et al., 2007), even in other microhabitats oil contaminated of Ria the Aveiro \n\n(Coelho et al., 2011, Domingues et al., 2013). Same endophytic strains revealed \n\ndegradation potential with an importance of nah genotypes in the PAH degradation in \n\nsalt marsh plants. A dominance of nah-like genotypes in isolates after enrichment with \n\nnaphthalene has been reported (Ma et al., 2006, Ni Chadhain et al., 2006). Plasmid-\n\nmediated mineralization of aromatic hydrocarbon (AH) is a major process of oil \n\nhydrocarbon biodegradation. So, the horizontal gene transfer mediated by catabolic \n\nplasmid plays an important role in AH degradation capacity of salt marsh bacterial \n\ncommunities. The detection, in same endophytic isolates, of IncP-9 catabolic plasmids, \n\na plasmid family known for carrying genes encoding for enzymes involved in \n\nhydrocarbon degradation, suggests that horizontal gene transfer can drive the spread of \n\nnah genes in these habitats and probably contribute to the process of bacterial \n\nendophytic adaptation and in planta OH decontamination. \n\nBased on the results obtained from the field, the following conclusions can be \n\ndrawn: \n\n- The structure and composition of microbial communities in salt marsh \n\nmicrohabitats (bulk sediment, rhizosphere and endosphere) are affected by site-\n\nrelated and plant-related factors.  \n\n\n\nConclusions \n\n103 \n\n \n\n- Halophyte colonization could be an important driver of the structure of \n\nhydrocarbonoclastic bacterial community in salt marsh sediments, which can be \n\nexploited for in situ phytoremediation of OH in salt marsh environments. \n\n- The culturable fraction of endophytic PAH degraders revealed the presence of \n\ngenetic determinants for hydrocarbon degradation (plasmids and nah genes), \n\nsuggesting a potential ecological role of bacterial-plant symbionts on the process \n\nof colonization and in plant survival in urban estuarine areas exposed to OH \n\ncontamination.  \n\n \n\nMicrocosm component  \n\nA plant-sediment microcosm experiment was designed in order to \n\nexperimentally manipulate the concentration of a representative aromatic hydrocarbon \n\n(2-methylnaphthalene) and test if the introduction of an indigenous endophytic \n\nhydrocarbon-degrading bacterium can reduce contaminant toxicity to plants and \n\nenhance contaminant degradation.  \n\nPlant condition was not significantly affected by the addition of a moderate \n\nconcentration of 2-methylnaphthalene, leading to the conclusion that Halimione \n\nportulacoides plants are tolerant to a concentration of 10 \u00b5 g g-1. At the end of the \n\nexperiment, the concentration of 2-methylnaphthalene in spiked sediments was reduced \n\nby approximately 75 %. Phytoremediation studies suggest that plants have the ability to \n\nstimulate PAH-degrading microorganisms, ultimately enhancing hydrocarbon \n\nbioremediation (Phillips et al., 2006, Ribeiro et al., 2011). In fact, at the end of the \n\nexperiment, the detection of catabolic genotypes in bacteria from plants corresponding \n\nto particular microcosm treatments (spiking with 2-methylnaphthalene) suggests that \n\nhydrocarbonoclastic populations were enriched in response to contamination.  \n\nThe use of a microbial inoculant or a consortium, in interaction with plants, to \n\npromote degradation of hydrocarbon contaminants has been well explored, with a \n\nvariety of results reported in the literature. A genetically modified endophytic strain of \n\nBurkholderia cepacia was shown to increase the tolerance of Lupinus luteus to toluene, \n\nwhile decreasing toluene evapotranspiration (Barac et al., 2004). Another study \n\nconcluded that despite the failure of endophytic inocula to survive in detectable \n\nnumbers, transference of their degradative plasmids to endogenous endophytic \n\n\n\nConclusions \n\n104 \n\n \n\ncommunities occurred (Taghavi et al., 2005). So, the efficient colonization of plants by \n\nmicrobial pollutant-degraders can represent a major contribution to plant survival and \n\nhydrocarbon degradation. The viability and colonization efficiency of an applied strain, \n\nhowever, depends on a variety of factors: plant and bacterial genotypes, inoculation \n\nmode and the physicochemical properties of the soil environment. The inoculation \n\nmethod and soil type can exert a major effect on plant growth, bacterial survival and \n\nactivity and hydrocarbon degradation. The importance of inoculation procedures and \n\nsoil type should be considered in the design of efficient phytoremediation applications \n\n(Afzal et al., 2011, Afzal et al., 2013).  \n\nBased on the results obtained in the microcosm approach the following conclusions \n\ncan be drawn: \n\n- H. portulacoides can influence the structure of microbial communities by \n\nselectively enhancing the development of hydrocarbons degrading populations \n\nthat can contribute to hydrocarbon degradation and removal in salt marshes. \n\n- The enhancement of 2-methylnaphthalene degradation by inoculation of the \n\nplants with the PAH-degrading endophytic bacteria could not be demonstrated.  \n\n- An efficient colonization of the hydrocarbon-degrading Pseudomonas spp. strain \n\ncan be inferred from the changes imposed on the structure of the indigenous \n\nendophytic communities, at the end of the microcosm experiment, indicating \n\nthat this strain may be regarded as good colonizer of H. portulacoides roots.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nReferences \n\n105 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nAcosta?Gonz\u00e1lez A, Rossell\u00f3?M\u00f3ra R &amp; Marqu\u00e9s S (2013) Characterization of the \n\nanaerobic microbial community in oil?polluted subtidal sediments: aromatic \n\nbiodegradation potential after the Prestige oil spill.
