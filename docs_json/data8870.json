Within \nthe zone of strain, level L2 comprises basal calcareous marls displaying 1 cm-thick zones of bed-parallel foliation developed in an anastomosed \npathway to form pillow-like features, and upper layers of evaporite where tens of mushrooms or diapirs are observed. They commonly display \na~ 1 m-sized circular geometry on bed-parallel sections, a ~0.5 m high central zone forming a generally bed-perpendicular tail, and are surrounded \nby rim synclines where the evaporite layers are entrapped together with chert and shale; level 3 consists of evaporite and shales displaying cm- \nto dm-scale extension and contraction structures; level L4 comprises remnants of evaporite layers embedded in a shale matrix - a tectonic \nmelange; and level L5 comprises blocks of evaporite and limestone involved in a shale / argillite matrix, a limestone breccia (the so-called \nBroken Beds) inside which some layers are still preserved and exhibit 1-10 m-scale contraction and extension structures. Level L5 results from \nthe westwards displacement of a wedge above an extensional detachment (the interface L3 / L4) and below another detachment established on \na layer of shale at the contact with level L6. The mushrooms clearly deform the L3 / L4 detachment and are interpreted as thermal convection \nstructures formed by a progressive down-sucking of the layers back in the direction of an imaginary point at the center of the diapirs - a \ncentripetal suction leading to contraction and coeval extension, soon after initial displacement of the wedge. The pillow-like features result from \npercolation of fluids across the marls simultaneously with the evolution of the mushrooms. \nKeywords : Diapirism, structural analysis, Purbeck Formation, thermal convection, salt tectonics \nRESUMO No afloramento F\u00f3ssil Forest da localidade de Lulworth Cove, no sul da Inglaterra, a Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Purbeck (Jur\u00e1ssico) engloba uma \ncunha (espessura ~ lOm) de rochas divididas em quatro andares verticalmente justapostos, os quais diferem quanto a estilos / intensidade de \ndeforma\u00e7\u00e3o (L2-L5) e ocorrem encaixados entre dois andares de rochas n\u00e3o deformadas (LI e L6). O andar L2 consiste, na base, de margas \ncarbon\u00e1ticas que exibem zonas de 1-2 cm de espessura nas quais a rocha \u00e9 foliada e que se disp\u00f5em de modo a formar um padr\u00e3o anastomosado \nou em almofadas e, no topo, de camadas de evaporitos exibindo dezenas de estruturas na forma de cogumelos (ou di\u00e1piros) que t\u00eam geometria \nnormalmente circular (~lm de di\u00e2metro) em se\u00e7\u00f5es paralelas ao acamamento, e que normalmente exibem uma zona tubular central com cerca \nde 0.5 m de altura, formando uma chamin\u00e9 ou cauda perpendicular \u00e0s camadas; tais estruturas s\u00e3o comumente circundadas por dobras sinclinais \nasim\u00e9tricas e apertadas, na zona interna das quais o evaporito, folhelho e chert s\u00e3o trapeados e deformados. O andar L3 consiste de evaporitos \ne folhelhos afetados por estruturas compressionais e extensionais de escala sub-m\u00e9trica; o andar L4 consiste de fragmentos de camadas de \nevaporito misturados caoticamente em matriz de folhelhos, ou seja, t\u00edpica melange tect\u00f4nica; e o andar L5 apresenta camadas brechadas de \nevaporito e calc\u00e1reo, com intercala\u00e7\u00f5es de folhehos e argilitos, todas afetadas por estruturas compressionais e extensionais de escala = l 0 metros. \nO andar L5 resulta do deslocamento, para oeste, das camadas superiores da cunha ao longo e acima de um descolamento extensional estabe- \nlecido na interface dos andares L3 e L4, e abaixo de um outro descolamento estabelecido ao longo de camada de folhelho no contato com o andar \nL6.

The detailed structural \nanalysis presented in the companion paper has allowed to show that, at \nthe Fossil Forest cliff, the Purbeck Formation encloses a ~ 10 m-thick \nwedge of highly deformed rocks divided in four juxtaposed structural \nlevels (L2-L5) situated above non deformed limestones (level L I )  and \nbelow non deformed limestones with intercalated shales / argillites \n(level L6). Structural level L2 comprises basal calcareous marls \ndisplaying 1 cm-thick zones of bed-parallel foliation developed in an \nanastomosed pathway to form pillow-like features, and upper layers of \nevaporite plus chert / shale deformed around the mushrooms. Level 3 \nconsists of evaporite and shales displaying cm- to dm-scale extension \nand contraction structures such as boudinage, domino- and listric-style \nnormal faults; a bedding sub-parallel foliation affected by recumbent \nfolds; and thrust faults as well as asymmetric folds verging either to the \nwest or to the east. Level L4 comprises remnants of evaporite layers \n\nand fragments of these layers embedded in a shale matrix, a typical \ntectonic melange. Level L5 (the so-called Broken Beds) comprises = \nIm-sized blocks of evaporite and limestone involved in a shale / \nargillite matrix (a typical limestone breccia) and also some still \npreserved layers exhibit 1-10 m-scale contraction and extension \nstructures such as asymmetric folds, thrust, and planar- and listric-style \nnormal faults. \n\nThe detailed description of the structures led to the conclusions \nthat: (1) - Structural level L5 results from the westward displacement \nof a wedge above a top-down to the west extensional detachment \nestablished on levels L3 and L4 and below a detachment established \nalong a layer of shale at the contact with level L6. The Broken Beds \nformed by intense fracturing associated to inter-layer slip and also to \nthe folding that resulted from this slip; (2) - The westward \ndisplacement may be part of a more regional tectonic event, if one \nconsiders that the close spatial relationship of the Broken Beds and the \nevaporite layers, at the Fossil Forest cliff, is remarkably noticed across \nseveral localities of the Dorset coast, according to a detailed \ndescription in West (1975); (3) - The displacement of the wedge took \nplace earlier in the Alpine inversion of the Wessex basin, that ended \nthe tilting of Purbeck Beds to the north. The chaotic structure of the \nbreccia was finally attained by further slip associated to this latter \ntilting; (4) - The record of varied style and intensity of strain, even for \nadjacent parts of a single layer or in juxtaposed structural levels makes \nthe Fossil Forest outcrop a key field locality for understanding crustal \ndeformation processes that have been described in recent literature \n(summary in Axen et al. 1998); and (5) -The east-west flow along the \nbasal evaporite detachment was followed in time by the north-south \ncompression of the whole area, implying in a vertical juxtaposition of \nnearly orthogonal kinematics that may fit in the transpression-related \nCenozoic inversion of European basins (Ziegler 1989). \n\nUniversidade de Brasilia - Institute de Geociencias - Campus Universitario, Asa Norte, 70.910-900, Brasilia, DF, Brazil - e-mail: ldel-rey@unb.br \n\nRevista Brasileira de Geoci\u00eancias 31(l):75-82, mar\u00e7o de 2001\n\n\n\nStructures in Jurassic Rocks of the Wessex Basin, southern England - II: Diaprism in evaporite layers \n\nThis paper adds to the structural analysis in the companion paper, \nand presents a detailed description and interpretation of the origin of \nthe pillows and the mushrooms of structural level L2 of the Fossil \nForest cliff. As will be shown, the mushrooms are tectonic features \nmost probably originated by thermal convection, and the detailed \nanalysis of deformation around their rim synclines provides important \nelements to understand how the process evolves. The results in here \nshow that systematic studies of particular outcrops may lead to \nalternative ways to understand natural features in the field, helping to \nconstrain their possible interpretations. Adopting a similar ki nd of \napproach, Prof. J.G. Ramsay (1992) concentrated his attention to the \nsmall-scale structures of another particular outcrop situated about 10 \nkm to the east of West Lulworth, and obtained results that allowed him \nto argue for caution on the indiscriminate application of the theory of \npropagation of thrust faults. \n\nSTRUCTURES WITHIN LEVEL L2 The p i l l o w - l i k e  \nstructures These features are restricted to a~ 0.5 m-thick layer of \nbrown calcareous marl that West (1975) named Dirt Beds. Pillows are \ndrawn in the rock by anastomosed 1 cm-thick zones where the rock \nacquires a brownish y ellow color and an internal, border-parallel \nfoliation (Fig. la), giving to the Dirt Beds the aspect of a collage of \npillows, the geometry of which implies that the termination of the \nbodies commonly looks l i ke  a folded f o l i a t i o n  (Fig. 1b )  seen in \nsurfaces of any orientation. Geometrically speaking, the pillows are \noblate ellipsoidal bodies that on bed-parallel sections appear as ellipses \nwith maximum axis no greater than a meter, and maximum / minimum \naxial ratio close to 1, whereas in bed-perpendicular sections they \nappear as ellipses with minor axis no greater than 10 cm and axial ratio \nbetween 3-5. \n\nThe mushrooms The process responsible for the mushrooms to \ndevelop certainly made them more resistant, as many (tens) remain \nhigher than the surrounding layers (Fig. 2a), as t y pi c a l  dome-like \nstructures, or true 3-D diapirs surrounded by r i m  synclines inside \nwhich the layers are strongly deformed. As a common characteristic, \nall mushrooms are bui l d on evaporite layers and contain a ri m of \nsynclines where the layers situated above are enclosed and highly  \ndeformed. \n\nOn bedding-parallel sections most mushrooms display a circular \nshape with diameter around a meter, and contain an empty central tube \nperpendicular to bedding (Fig. 2a), like a cylinder or a tail with a sub- \ncircular basal section with diameter around 0.5 m and a height of 50- \n60 cm. At a first look, these appear to be characteristic for all \nmushrooms, but a more careful search indicates other important \nparticularities: (1) - Some mushrooms have central tubes with = 1.5 in- \nlong axis disposed parallel to the beds, and their partial erosion results \nin a rather e l l i p t i c  geometry (center of Fig. 2b); (2) - Mushrooms \nexposed to less erosion display a central tube only few centimeters \nwide (the left, Fig. 2b), or s i m p l y  display  a ring structure of the \nevaporite layers at their top, instead of the tube (Fig. 2c); (3) - A strong \nstriae lineation (Fig. 2d-e) may be observed on the walls of the central \ntube, parallel to the tube axis; (4) - The mushrooms occur randomly \nacross level L2, and are normally separated one from each other by a \ndistance of one to more meters. At one p a r t i c u l a r  place, two \nmushrooms shared space during t he i r evolution and develop the \ngeometry of an eight (\"8\") at the surface (Fig. 2 f ) ;  (5) - Layers of \nbluish gray chert and light brown calcareous shale that lie on the top of \nthe mushrooms are normally found entrapped and deformed inside the \nrim synclines (Fig. 3a-f, Fig. 4a-c), but the deeper hinge of the ri m \nsynclines is invariably built on folded evaporite layers (Fig. 3b-d). A \nset of closely-spaced partition planes is sub-parallel to the axial plane \nof the rim syncline and affects the chert (Fig. 3e); (6) - On the outer \nsurface of the mushrooms, the contact between the evaporite layers and \nthe chert (in the single place where it could be closely observed - Fig. \n5a) is marked by a through-going ductile-brittle and ~ 1 cm-thick zone \nof deformation (Fig. 5b) that consists of a fine-grained matrix, \nprobably of calcareous shale or marl, enclosing fragments of chert and \nevaporite. Otherwise, the contact may be normal and displaying a \nstriae lineation that turns around the outer surface and points to the \ncentral tube (Fig. 5c); and finally  (7) -The mushrooms with bedding- \nparallel central tube also di spl a y  r i m  sy nclines w i t h  the same \ncharacteristics as those with bedding-perpendicular tube (Fig. 6a-b). \n\n \n\nFigure 1 a-b : The pillows of level L2. These structures are bound by cm-thick \nanastomosed zones of brownish yellow material displaying an internal, \nborder-parallel foliation, as pointed by the arrow in ( a ) .  The termination of \nthe pillows often displays geometry of folds (b). \n\nTIMING FOR EVOLUTION OF THE MUSHROOMS    Key \ncontact relationships, observed j u s t  a few meters to the west of the \nlower steps of the stairs that give access to the outcrop (see Fig. 3c in \nthe companion paper), clearly indicate that some mushrooms stay \nhigher than the basal detachment and that they pushed up and \ndeformed the layers of structural level L3 and the tectonic melange of \nstructural level L4 (Fig. 7a-d). These findings demonstrate that the \nmushrooms are tectonic features that must have developed soon after \nthe i n i t i a l  displacement of the rocks of level L5 along the basal \ndetachment, or after cessation of the entire movement. \n\nOther evidence indicates evolution of the mushrooms under the \nsame conditions of viscous flow as those for the evolution of the \nstructures already described in level L3, in the first paper of this series. \nThis evidence (ahead in this section), plus the lack of north trending \nlineations that could be indicative of a northward driven flow along the \nevaporite layers of levels L2 and L3, together w i t h  all the \ncharacteristics of the mushrooms described in the previous section, all \nindicate an evolution soon after the beginning of the displacement of \nthe wedge to the west, still before the final tectonic inversion that led \nto overall tilting of the Purbeck Beds to the north. \n\nT I M I N G  FOR DEFORMATION WITHIN THE PURBECK \nBEDS Thus, by considering also the results of a companion paper, \nthe following sequence of Cenozoic events that contributed for the \n\nRevista Brasileira de Geociencias, Volume 31, 2001 76 \n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 2 a-f: Typical mushrooms of structural level L2.

The elliptic geometry results from erosion of mushrooms with a bed-parallel tube. \nThe circular body to the right does not show the central tube, whereas the tube of the one to the left may be noticed through a 1 cm-wide circular hole, (c) \nConcentric rings of evaporite layers situated at the top of the mushrooms, (d) A strong striae lineation parallel to the axis of the central tube - shown in detail \n(e) parallel to the red knife, (f) Geometry resulting from the partial erosion of two mushrooms that shared room during evolution. \n\nultimate structural configuration of the Purbeck Beds in the Fossil \nForest cliff may be envisaged: / - Start up of viscous How within the \nevaporite layers of level L3, leading to small-scale contemporaneous \nextension and contraction structures, followed by displacement of the \nlayers above to form the tectonic melange (L4) and the Broken Beds \n(L5); 2 - Viscous How within the layers below the basal detachment \n\nleading to the mushroom and pillow-like structures of level L2; 3 - All \nthe Purbeck Beds are tilted to the north, late in the tectonic inversion \nof the Wessex Basin. Further slip to the north took place within level \nL5 and contributed for the final shaping of the Broken Beds. This later \ndeformation may have been f a c i l i t a t e d  by the large amount of a \nlubricant matrix of shale / argillite within level L5. \n\nRevista Brasileira de Geoci\u00eancias, Volume 31, 2001 \n\nLuiz Jose Homem D'el-Rey Silva\n\n77\n\n\n\nStructures in Jurassic Rocks of the Wessex Basin, southern England - II: Diaprism in evaporite layers \n\n \n\nFigure 3 tt-f: The rim synclines and their evolution.

Thin arrow points to the place detailed in the next \npictures, (b) Lateral view of the mushroom with the knife at the hinge of a sub- \nrecumbent rim svncline. \n\nEVOLUTION OF THE MUSHROOMS In order to understand \nthe evolution of the mushrooms, attention should be driven to key \nfeatures provided by the layers of chert and shale that are entrapped \nand strongly deformed in the rim synclines (Fig. 3-4). In fact, chert \nlayers commonly occurs in close association with the mushrooms, \nsurrounding them or resting between two or more of these features \n(Fig. 3a). The chert layers are thickened inside the rim synclines, as \nwell as at the upper part of these folds, relatively to the adjacent areas, \nand vanish towards the top of the mushrooms (Fig. 3b-d). The same is \nalso valid for layers of shale. Going into the rim synclinc (Fig. 3e) the \nchert (or shale) is submitted to strong compression and acquires (in \nthat particular case) a set of closely-spaced fractures, and the alignment \nof many of them leads to a set partition planes sub-parallel to the axial \nplane of the fold - such as a spaced cleavage. \n\nThe fact that chert (or shale) entrapped into the ri m synclines is \nsystematically well below its original topographic level (Figs. 3d-e) \ndemonstrates that the mushrooms formed as a consequence of viscous \nflow during which layers of evaporite were pulled down and carried \ninto the rim synclines, together with layers situated above (chert or \nshale) as indicated by the larger arrow in Figure 3c. Once the synclines \nturn around all the periphery of the mushrooms, the matter must have \nbeen p u l l e d  back and down towards a central point, l i k e  the one \ni n d i c a t e d  by the bl ue  bag in Figure 3c. In other words, the r i m  \nsynclines correspond to the areas into which the evaporite layers were \nsucked down, and this movement led to a centripetal underthrusting of \n\nthe evaporite layers and uplift of the top of the mushrooms. The vast \nmajority of them are up-facing, but down-facing mushrooms of smaller \nscale may be also observed locally in the Fossil Forest outcrop (Fig. \n3f). \n\nThe viscous flow is also demonstrated by evidence for a \nprogressive evolution of the rim synclines, or suction zones, as in the \nlocality of Figure 4, where the well-defined lamination of the light \nbrown shale allows to identify subtle variations in thickness, from the \ninside to the outside of the rim sy nclines, as well as a kind of \n\"unconformable\" relationship between layers that are more internal in \nthe synclines and others situated above (Fig. 4a-c). \n\nThickness variations and the \"unconformable\" relationship are \ntectonic features indicative of progressive entrapment into the rim \nsynclines (Fig. 8): the first layers entrapped in synclines are thickened \nand leave no room for much more material to be sucked down, so that \nthe last layers to enter in the rim syncline remain at the top of the folds \nand are only slightly thickened. The tectonic unconformity develops at \nthat part because the suction of the layers into the rim syncline has to \nbe accommodated by extension of adjacent parts of the same layers \noutside and even inside the zone of contraction. This strain is taken up \nby d u c t i l e  t h i n n i n g  of the layers above the head of the same \nmushroom, or above the head of the adjacent one (Fig. 8), whereas \nlayers coming later into the suction zone show less variation of \nthickness and truncate the borders of the layers that entered first in the \nrim synclines. Even the external limb of the syncline may be thinned \nor affected by extension faults, as a consequence of this process of \nunderthrusting. \n\nDISCUSSION Given that the mushrooms are a consequence of \nviscous flow w i t h i n  evaporite layers of level 2, and that this flow \nsucceeded shortly in time the onset of the tectonic melange (level L4), \nwhy is it that the How in level L2 took place and why is it that it obeys \na 3-D concentric pattern, rather than being directed to the west, as the \ninitial flow in level L3 and above?. \n\nThe mushrooms of the Fossil Forest outcrop have all t h e  \ncharacteristics of typical diapirs that Jackson et al (1990) described in \ndetail in the Great Kavir of Iran, and interpreted as thermal convection \nstructures: the overall shape, the rim synclines and the overall pattern \nof deformation associated, the central tube, the lineation parallel to the \naxis of the tubes. Moreover, down-suction of the upper chert (or shale) \nlayers into the rim synclines and uplift of the lower evaporite layers to \nform the head of the mushrooms lead to an stratigraphic inversion \nnormally associated to diapirism (Schenk &amp; Jackson 1993). In \naddition, the contact relationships of Figure 5 may be taken as \nevidence for the radial friction between evaporite layers and others \nabove, along the outer surface of the mushrooms. This friction and the \ncentral tube are due to the flow of the matter up and around the head \nof the diapirs (Fig. 8), as has been extremely well portrayed in Figures \n2.8 and 2.9 of Jackson et al. (1990). But yet: why is it a thermal driven \nprocess? \n\nSalt (or evaporite) layers have a viscosity that is naturally lower \nt h a n  t h a t  of other sediments, and is suffi c i e nt l y  close to the low \nviscosity that allows the critical Rayleigh number to be achieved, \ntriggering thermal convection in these sediments (Jackson et al. 1990). \nThese authors described thermal convection features much smaller or \nas big as the mushrooms of Lulworth Cove, and calculated that even a \nsmall increase in temperature is sufficient to make the natural viscosity \nof cvaporites equal to the critical value for onset of the process. \nFurthermore, the thermal conductivity of salt (evaporite) is a factor of \ntwo to three times higher than that of typical sediments, and this is a \nkey factor for heat to be transported upwards, across the salt layers in \norder to facilitate thermal maturation of oil in the sediments above \n(Petersen &amp; Lerche 1996). As the evaporite layers of structural levels \nL4 and L5 lost cohesion - giving rise to the melange and Broken Beds \n- they also lost the natural capacity for a sufficiently fast transport of \nthe heat generated by friction along the basal detachment (level L3 / \nL4). Thus, it is quite realistic to t h i n k  that going down into the \ncohesive layers of evaporites of level L2 the friction heat found a much \nmore favorable way to dissipate. Finding a highly thermal conductive \nbut sub-horizontal layer, heat had to dissipate very fast laterally, and \nthermal convection is the most efficient process if compared to other \nprocesses such as thermal radiation (Elder 1976). Another factor that \nmay have significantly contributed for thermal convection to take place \nis the high salinity of the evaporite layers that West (1975) noticed \n\nRevista Brasileira de Geoci\u00eancias, Volume 31, 2001 80 \n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 7 a-d : Mushrooms deforming levels L3 and L4. ( a )  Two mushrooms pushing up and deforming levels L3 and L4. The one to the right (thick arrow) \ndeforms evaporite layers already incorporated to the tectonic melange, and the one to the left lies 50 cm above the level of the contact between levels L3 and \nL4. (b) Detail of the previous picture to show (arrow X) the tectonic melange curved down towards the rim syncline, and (arrow Y) the fracturing of a remnant \nof bottom layer of the melange, as it turned around the head of the mushroom, ( c )  Detail of (a) to show the mushroom 50 cm higher above the contact between \nlevels L2 and L3 / L4 (just above the black bar). Arrow points to the place detailed in the next picture, (d) The layers of the interface L3 / L4 are strongly \nfractured / rotated and attain a sub-vertical dip around the mushroom. \n\nacross the southern coast of Dorset. High salinity is one of the factors \nthat positively contribute to rendering the thermal convection process \neasier and more vigorous (Elder 1978). It may facilitate that micro \nelectric-magnetic currents propagate within the layers: these currents \nare a key factor for convection of natural fluids, according to Van \nHeijst &amp; Flor (1989) and, despite of the lack of further investigation, \nthese currents may also be important for convection of rock matter \nwith very low viscosity, such as salts and evaporites. \n\nOnce the bottom of the evaporite layers occur no more than 1-2 m \nbelow the bottom of the Broken Beds (West 1975, see Fig. 2b in the \ncompanion paper) and discounting the thickness of levels L4 and L3, \nthen the best way for the quickest propagation of heat was laterally \nwithin the 0.5 m-thick blanket of level L2, where thermal conductivity \nshould have been much higher than in the layers above and below. If \nso, the lateral propagation of heat w i t h i n  t hi s horizontal corridor \ncontributed for lowering even more the viscosity of the evaporite \nlayers and helped to trigger thermal convection. This situation may \nexplain the occurrence of the mushrooms along a single stratigraphic \nlevel at Lulworth Cove, and also across the several localities of the \nsouthern coast of Dorset, always at s i m i l a r  proximity to the lower \ncontact of the Broken Beds (West 1975, his Figs. 2 and 3). His detailed \nstudy indicates that two stratigraphic levels w i t h  diapiric structures, \nsuch as those described here, are found only at the Perryfield Quarry, \nin the Bill of Portland (Fig. 2a of the first paper), and indicates that for \nall the localities the mushrooms are situated above layers of marl or the \n\n \n\nFigure 8 : Cartoon to represent the overall geometry of the mushrooms (thick \nline) and the main aspects of deformation of the layers outside.

These are the layers that contain the pillow-like structures \nfound at the Fossil Forest cliff. The flow of fluids that likely generated \nthe pillows may well mark the lower level significantly affected by \ndissipation of the friction heat. \n\nCONCLUSIONS Among several other points of geological \ninterest, the surroundings of West Lulworth, Dorset, southern \nEngland, also enclose outcrops of the Upper Jurassic Purbeck Beds \nalong a cliff to the west of Lulworth Cove, at which tens of mushrooms \nand an impressive limestone breccia claim the observers' attention. \nAbundant field data summarized in this paper demonstrate that: (1) - \nThe mushrooms are ~ Im-scale diapiric structures developed within a \nsingle set of evaporite layers that overly a set of marls and these \ndisplay = 1 cm-thick pillow-like structures formed by an anastomosed \narray of zones where the rock acquires an internal, layer-parallel \nfoliation; (2) - Mushrooms and pillows form a \" 1 m-thick structural \nlevel situated above non deformed limestones and below another level, \nas thick as = 1 . 3  m, in which a top-down to the west extensional \ndetachment developed and gave Origin to a typical tectonic melange; \n(3) - The mushrooms push-up and deform the melange, and are \ntectonic structures (diapirs) that evolved soon after the onset of \ndisplacement along the detachment; (4) - The diapirs result from \nviscous flow in the evaporites, under a progressive down-suction of the \nlayers back in the direction of an imaginary central point within the \nmushrooms - a centripetal movement leading to contraction of the \nlayers by underthrust and formation of the rim synclines that exist all \naround. A sequence of progressive tectonic events has been \nestablished: 1 - A ~ 10 m-thick wedge of layers of evaporite, limestone \n\nand shale / argillite moved to the west, above the extensional \ndetachment. Intra- and inter-layer slip within the wedge resulted in \nfolding and fracturing of the layers and formed the Broken Beds. 2 - \nHeat due to friction along the basal detachment found the easiest way \nto dissipate along the evaporite layers situated below, generating the \ndiapirs by thermal convection. 3 - Tilting of the whole set of Purbeck \nBeds to the north, as the result of the ultimate tectonic inversion of the \nWessex Basin, with further movement within the Broken Beds \ncontributing for its final chaotic appearance. \n\nAcknowledgements This and the companion paper result from \nfield work that I carried out at three opportunities, in parallel with my \nPhD research (RHUL, Egham-UK, 1989-1992).
