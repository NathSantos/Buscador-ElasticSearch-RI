In Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, most fruit\n\nproduction is found on small properties under organic cultivation. Soil compaction\n\nis one of the factors limiting production and due to the fixed row placement of this\n\ncrop, compaction can arise in various manners in the interrows of the orchard.\n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate soil physical properties and water infiltration\n\ncapacity in response to interrow management in an orchard of mandarin (Citrus\n\ndeliciosa Tenore \u2018Montenegrina\u2019) under organic cultivation. Interrow management\n\nwas performed through harrowing, logs in \"V\", mowing, and cutting/knocking down\n\nplants with a knife roller. Soil physical properties were evaluated in the wheel\n\ntracks of the tractor (WT), between the wheel tracks (BWT), and in the area under\n\nthe line projection of the canopy (CLP), with undisturbed soil samples collected in\n\nthe 0.00-0.15, 0.15-0.30, 0.30-0.45, and 0.45-0.60 m layers, with four replicates. The\n\nsoil water infiltration test was performed using the concentric cylinder method,\n\nwith a maximum time of 90 min for each test. In general, soil analysis showed a\n\nvariation in the physical-hydraulic properties of the Argissolo Vermelho-Amarelo\n\ndistr\u00f3fico ar\u00eanico (sandy loam Typic Paleudalf) in the three sampling sites in all\n\nlayers, regardless of the management procedure in the interrows.

Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, is the third\nlargest producer in the national ranking (FAO, 2009),\nwith the Ca\u00ed Valley as its largest production region,\nwhere the \u2018Montenegrina\u2019 variety prevails\n(Montenegro, 2013).\n\nC i t r u s  p r o d u c t i o n  i n  t h e  C a \u00ed  V a l l e y  i s\nconcentrated on small properties, under organic and\nbiodynamic growing. The latter, although based on\nthe same principles and techniques of organic\nagriculture, has some particular features, such as\nspiritual issues related to anthroposophy, the use\nof biodynamic preparations. and astrological\ncalendars (IBD, 2009).\n\nThe activities performed in citrus orchards in Rio\nGrande do Sul involve weed control, fertilization,\npruning, fruit thinning, plant health measures, and\nharvest. Most of them are performed with the aid of\n\nfarm equipment and some orchards are subject to as\nmany as 300 passes of this equipment between plant\nrows throughout their existence.\n\nRichart et al. (2005) claim that farm equipment\ntraffic is considered to be the main cause of soil\ncompaction between plant rows in Brazilian orchards.\nAccording to Servadio et al. (2005), deliberate use of\nmachines in citrus orchards leads to reduction in\nmacropore volume (pores > 0.05 \u00b5m), whereas\nmicropore volume (pores &lt;0.05 \u00b5m) remains\nunchanged, affecting total soil porosity. Li et al. (2007)\nclaim that this change in soil porosity reduces water\ninfiltration capacity and soil water storage. In this\ncontext, an understanding of water infiltration\ncapacity and its relation to soil physical properties\nis essential for efficient soil and water management\nin agricultural production (Reichardt &amp; Timm,\n2004).\n\nSince mandarin is a perennial crop with fixed\nspacing between plant rows, the tractor tracks in\nthese orchards are always in the same position. That\n\n\n\nCaroline Valverde dos Santos et al.\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 38:1882-1889, 2014\n\n1884\n\ncauses a soil-tire contact \u201cexclusive zone\u201d, creating\nheterogeneity in the soil physical-hydraulic properties\nin the interrows of the orchards. Soil samplings were\nperformed in the wheel tracks and between the wheel\ntracks in order to identify possible physical-hydraulic\nrestrictions to development of citrus crops in Brazilian\norchards (Fidalski et al., 2007).\n\nBased on the above, the aim of this study was to\nevaluate soil physical-hydraulic properties in response\nto interrow management in a \u2018Montenegrina\u2019\nmandarin orchard under organic growing. The\nhypothesis is that the interrow management in citrus\norchards leads to heterogeneity in soil compaction in\nareas under the wheel tracks of the machinery and\noutside the area of these tracks, impairing soil water\ndynamics.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nThe experiment was carried out in an organic\norchard of mandarin (Citrus deliciosa Tenore\n\u2018Montenegrina\u2019), located in the physiographic region\nof the Depress\u00e3o Central of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.\nThe climate of the area is Cfa - humid subtropical,\nwith average temperature near 25 oC, average annual\nrainfall of 1,440 mm (Bergamaschi et al., 2003), and\nslope from 0.08 to 0.12 m m-1.\n\nThe soil of the area was classified as sandy loam\nTypic Paleudalf, according to Soil Survey Staff (2010),\nwith 0.86,0.83, 0.84, and 0.78 kg dm-3 of sand in the\n0.00-0.15, 0.15-0.30, 0.30-0.45, and 0.45-0.60 m soil\nlayers, respectively, according to the results obtained\nthrough the pipette method (Embrapa, 2011), There\nwas predominance of medium and fine sand fractions,\nand particle density ranging from 2.54 to 2.55 kg dm-3\n(Table 1), determined using the volumetric flask\nmethod (Embrapa, 2011). This is within the proper\nlimits for sandy soils (2.30 to 2.90 kg dm-3), according\nto Libardi (2005).\n\nThe orchard was planted in 1990 in a conventional\nmanagement system, with seedlings placed at 3.0 m\nbetween plants and 6.5 m between rows in 234 m2\n\nplots, consisting of three rows of five plants each for a\ntotal of 15 plants per plot. The three central rows were\nconsidered as the useful plot area and a border row\nseparated the treatments.\n\nThe area was converted to an organic system in\n1998, and then to a biodynamic system in 2009.\nFertilizations were performed in biannual intervals,\nwith the application of 30 m3 ha-1 of solid compound\nand 30 m3 ha-1 of liquid biofertilizers prepared using\ncitrus bagasse and the bark of acacia (Acacia\nmearnsii), provided by the cooperative Ecocitrus,\nbringing about soil organic matter (OM) content of 50\nand 20 % in the 0.00-0.15 and 0.15-0.30 m surface\nlayers, respectively (Table 1), according to the\nWalkley-Black method (Tedesco et al., 1995).\n\nIn the orchard interrows, there is rather diverse\nplant cover, with predominance of the species\nSynedrellopsis grisebachii Hieron, Acanthospermum\nhispidum DC, Ipoema cairica (L.) Sweet, Brachiaria\nplantaginea (Link), Cyperus rotundus L., and\nLollium multiflorum Lam.\n\nThe treatments for weed control between plant rows\nwere: T1 - Harrow: partial incorporation of spontaneous\nvegetation into the soil at approximately 0.10-0.15 m\nusing a leveling harrow together with 20 1.7-m-wide\ndisks, in September, December, and March and\nweeding or mowing under the citrus canopy; T2 - Logs\nin \u201cV\u201d: knocking down spontaneous vegetation at the\nend of its cycle or when taller than 60 cm by dragging\ntwo log segments arranged in a \u201cV\u201d shape, each of 30\nto 40 cm diameter, using a device for attachment to\nthe three-point hitch of the tractor; T3 - Mower:\nmechanical cutting of spontaneous vegetation using\na 2.15-m-long, 1.7-m-wide mower pulled by a tractor\nwhen vegetation was taller than 60 cm, and manual\nmowing in the interrows (September, December, and\nMarch); and T4 - Knife roller: knocking down\nspontaneous vegetation in the interrows using a 2-m-\nwide knife roller pulled by a tractor when vegetation\nwas taller than 60 cm, and manual mowing in the\narea under the citrus canopy.\n\nEach plot was managed with one tractor pass in\nthe interrows. Implements were pulled by a Yanmar\n1055 tractor (55HP/2WD), weighing 1,985 kg.

Bras. Ci. Solo, 38:1882-1889, 2014\n\n18.4-30R1 and 14.9-24R1 diagonal tires were used on\nthe tractor for rear and front axles, respectively.\n\nAnalyses of the soil physical-hydraulic properties\nwere performed from July 2012 to February 2013.\nEvaluations were performed in soil samples collected\nat three different sites in the interrows: BWT (between\nthe wheel tracks), WT (in the wheel tracks) and CPL\n(under the projection of the canopy), with four\nreplicates per treatment (T1, T2, T3, and T4). Soil\nbulk density (BD) was determined through the\nvolumetric ring method (Embrapa, 2011), with\nundisturbed soil samples collected in the 0.00-0.15,\n0.15-0.30, 0.30-0.45, and 0.45-0.60 m layers, using\nsharp-edged volumetric rings with a height of 5.0 cm,\ndiameter of 8.5 cm, and volume of 283 cm3.\n\nThe same sample was used to determine\nmacroporosity (Ma), through the tension-table method,\nwith a 60.0-cm water column to remove water from\nthe samples through suction until they stopped\ndraining (approximately 48 h); microporosity (Mi),\nwhen samples were weighed again after the tension\ntable, remaining in an oven at 105 \u00baC until constant\nweight, i.e., 48 h after the beginning of drying; and\ntotal soil porosity (TP), which was obtained by the\nsum of soil macro- and microporosity, according to\nEmbrapa (2011).\n\nStatistical analyses for soil density, macroporosity,\nmicroporosity, and total porosity were performed\naccording to the split-plot design, using the software\nStatistical Analysis System (SAS), through analysis\nof variance. Whenever the F value was significant,\nthe mean values of the treatments were compared\nusing the Tukey test (p<0.05).\n\nThe water infiltration rate (f) and accumulated\ninfiltration (I) were determined using double ring\ninfiltrometers, both 40 cm in height and 30 and\n50 cm of inner and outer diameters, respectively,\naccording to the method described by Bernardo et al.\n(2006). Plant cover and surface roots were removed\nbefore placing the cylinders in order to avoid the\ninterference of soil cover in water infiltration. This\ntask was carefully performed using a hoe to avoid\nchanges in the soil surface.\n\nDuring the tests, hydraulic load was kept at\napproximately 15 cm height inside the inner ring.\nWhenever there was a decrease of 5.0 cm in the\nhydraulic load, the ring was manually replenished,\nand the adjusted height recorded. The maximum time\nfor each test was 90 min and the results were\nexpressed according to the average values of\ninfiltration rate and accumulated infiltration\nobtained in each replicate.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn general, soil physical analyses showed a\nvariation in the physical-hydraulic properties of the\n\nsandy loam Typic Paleudalf for the three sampling\nsites in all layers, regardless of the interrow\nmanagement applied in the mandarin orchard.\n\nThe Ma values in the 0.00-0.15 m layer (Table 2)\nwere low, especially in the WT of the interrows\nmanaged with log segments in \u201cV\u201d and the mower\n(0.06 and 0.10 m3 m-3, respectively). These results\nare close to the limiting value for aeration and root\ndevelopment which, according to Carter (2002), is 0.10\nm3 m-3. However, there are crops that require an\naeration volume either higher or lower than this\ncritical limit (Reinert et al., 2001).\n\nThese values, even with high OM content (Table\n1), are probably related to the fact that the surface\nexperiences greater interference from soil\nmanagement. In addition, the low Ma values in\ninterrows managed with the dragging of log\nsegments in \u201cV\u201d and the mower may be related to\nthe absence of soil turn-over when these implements\nare used, which occurs even briefly in turned soils,\nsuch as in interrows managed with a harrow and\nknife roller.\n\nHowever, the use of soil-turning and cutting\nimplements (such as the harrow) in citrus orchards\nis controversial since, while turning the soil, the disks\nproduce dust, cut roots, and, depending on the site,\ncause erosion (Durigan &amp; Timossi, 2002). Thus, they\nare no longer used in many regions.\n\nConsequently, there was a variation in Mi, in all\nsampling sites, regardless of the management used,\nwith the highest values (0.36 m3 m-3) being observed\nin the WT (Table 2). Such reorganization of Ma and\nMi in the soil caused a variation in TP; however, most\nof the observed results are found around the average\nvalue from 0.30 to 0.60 m3 m-3, mentioned by Hillel\n(1980) and Kiehl (1979) as the normal range verified\nfor most mineral soils.\n\nThe highest BD values were found in the interrows\nmanaged with the harrow and mower, especially in\nthe WT, reaching 1.54 kg dm-3 in both treatments.\nSimilar BD values for harrow and mower treatments\ncan be attributed to the fact that the cutting performed\nby the mower eliminates shoot apical dominance in\nplants, stimulating the growth of sprouts situated on\nthe interface with the soil and, consequently,\nincreasing the number of operations with these\nimplements, which favors soil compaction; while the\nuse of the harrow promotes cutting and turn-over in\nthe surface soil layer, which also favors soil compaction\n(Alc\u00e2ntara et al., 2000).\n\nThe 0.15-0.30 m layer also showed low Ma values,\nregardless of the management used (Table 2).\nSampling sites in WT and BWT showed values lower\nthan and close to the limits for root development and\nsoil aeration (from 0.08 to 0.11 m3 m-3).\n\nThe results found in this study are similar to those\nfound by Reichardt &amp; Timm (2004) and Libardi (2005)\nfor most Brazilian orchards (Ma values lower than\n\n\n\nCaroline Valverde dos Santos et al.\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 38:1882-1889, 2014\n\n1886\n\n0.15 m3 m-3), which are ideal for citrus at the 0.30 m\ndepth, according to these authors. In addition to the\nsoil compaction effect, the values found in this study\ncan also be attributed to the high contents of medium\nand fine sand, which, according to Souza (1996),\ncontribute to pore obstruction, lower water infiltration,\nand higher possibility of erosion.\n\nIn general, in the three sampling sites, regardless\nof the management used, Mi values were considered\nas satisfactory for citrus (Table 2). According to\nReichardt &amp; Timm (2004) and Libardi (2005), Mi\nvalues should be between 0.20 and 0.23 m3 m-3,\nwithout interfering in TP, which was between 0.30\nand 0.35 m3 m-3 in this study, corroborating the ideal\n\nvalues for citrus in sandy soils in this same layer\n(Reichardt &amp; Timm, 2004; Libardi, 2005).\n\nHowever, BD was affected by soil management in\nthe three sampling sites, with values ranging from\n1.49 to 1.65 kg dm-3. These values are considered\nhigher than desirable for sandy soils, which, according\nto Durigan &amp; Timossi (2002), should be between 1.25\nand 1.40 kg dm-3.

Bras. Ci. Solo, 38:1882-1889, 2014\n\nand BD), as shown in table 2. However, this variation\ndid not compromise soil macroporosity, which had\nvalues above the critical limit of 0.10 m3 m-3,\nregardless of the sampling site and implement used.\nThis result can be attributed to the fact that interrow\nmanagement and the tire-soil contact pressure do not\naffect soil structure in the deeper layers.\n\nThe water infiltration rate (f) and the accumulated\ninfiltration (I) in the orchard interrows were affected\nby the compaction resulted from interrow\nmanagement. The highest values were observed in\nthe CPL, in all treatments (Figure 1).\n\nThe intensity of machinery traffic, combined with\nsoil particle-size distribution, with the predominance\nof medium and fine sands (Table 1), led to a low water\ninfiltration rate (f), especially in the WT (f = 2.99,\n3.83, 2.98, and 1.15 mm h-1 for harrow, log segments\nin \u201cV\u201d, mower, and knife roller, respectively) and in\nBWT (f = 6.60, 10.80, 10.63, and 4.34 mm h-1 for\nharrow, log segments in \u201cV\u201d, mower, and knife roller,\nrespectively).\n\nTexture variation throughout the profile (Bernardo\net al., 2006) and the reduction in Ma lead to an\nincrease in soil density and a decrease in the soil water\n\nFigure 1. Water infiltration rate and accumulated water infiltration in three sampling sites: between the wheel\n\ntracks of the tractor (BWT), in the wheel tracks (WT), and under the projection of the canopy (CPL).\n\n\n\nCaroline Valverde dos Santos et al.\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 38:1882-1889, 2014\n\n1888\n\ninfiltration rate (Panachuki et al., 2006), as observed\nin this study. Although the tensions exerted by the\ntractor wheels propagate mostly vertically in the soil,\npart of these tensions also propagate sideways,\naffecting the sites between the wheel tracks of the\ntractor (Trein, 1995).\n\nAlthough the CPL site had the highest f values\n(f = 13.9, 20.55, 15.52, and 12.62 mm h-1 for harrow,\nlog segments in \u201cV\u201d, mower, and knife roller,\nrespectively), they are considered low, since the ideal\nwater infiltration rate for sandy soils should be between\n25 and 250 mm h-1, according to Bernardo et al. (2006).\n\nThe highest f values in this study were found in\nthe interrow managed with the dragging of log\nsegments in \u201cV\u201d (f = 20.55 mm h-1). This result is\ncontrary to that found by Pietrzacka (2009) in the\nsame orchard, in which the highest f values were\nfound in the area under harrowing management,\nbecause the soil had been recently turned over in the\ninterrows.\n\nWater infiltration rates in all sampling sites had\nhigh initial values, which later decreased and reached\na constant rate at 90 min of the test, as shown in the\nuse of the Kostiakov equation. For Libardi (2005),\nalthough it is empiric, the Kostiakov equation is very\nuseful for irrigation purposes due to its simplicity and\nbecause it is reasonably fitted to a great number of\nsoils at short time intervals (up to 150 min), in addition\nto providing information on the soil water absorption\ncapacity.\n\nBrand\u00e3o et al. (2006) explain that, in general, when\nsoil is turned over, the water infiltration capacity\nmeasured using double rings tends to increase because\nof the breakdown of soil structure in the surface layer,\nand it is higher in systems with soil management\ncompared to others with less or no disturbance (Abr\u00e3o\net al., 1979). However, repeated soil management\nprocedures can cause soil water infiltration rates lower\nthan those in areas with no soil management.\n\nIn addition, after saturation, turned-over soils are\nmore prone to surface erosion and transport of\nparticles and nutrients, which is favored in a Sandy\nLoam Typic Paleudalf because of its great amount\nof sand particles. Therefore, it is necessary to\nmaintain control over spontaneous vegetation in the\ninterrows of the orchard for the purpose of avoiding\nsoil losses by erosion and reduction in mandarin\nyield.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n1. Machinery traffic leads to heterogeneity in soil\nphysical-hydraulic properties in the interrows of the\norchard.\n\n2. Soil porosity and bulk density are especially\naffected in the tractor wheel tracks (WT), which causes\n\na reduction in the constant infiltration rate and in\nthe accumulated water infiltration in this sampling\nsite.\n\n3. The use of a disk harrow and mower leads to\ngreater harmful effects on soil, which can interfere in\nmandarin production.\n\nLITERATURE CITED\n\nABR\u00c3O, P.U.R.
