This latter sector \nis particularly important, as the 6 most important \nhydroelectric plants installed along the river \n(Serra da Mesa, Cana Brava, S\u00e3o Salvador, Peixe \nAngical, Lu\u00eds Eduardo Magalh\u00e3es and Tucuru\u00ed) \naccount for 15% of the hydroelectric production \nof Brazil (ANEEL 2010).\n\nBased on a study of Potter (1978), Gupta (2007) \nsynthesized the following parameters to define a \nbig river: length > 103km, drainage basin area > \n10  km , water discharge > 200x109 m3/year and \nsediment load up to 1000Mt/year. According to this \ndefinition, the Tocantins River should be included \nin such category, although suspended sediment load \nis comparatively small due to the fact that the river \n\nAnais da Academia Brasileira de Ci\u00eancias (2012) 84(3): 645-654\n(Annals of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences)\nPrinted version ISSN 0001-3765 / Online version ISSN 1678-2690\nwww.scielo.br/aabc\n\n\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2012) 84 (3)\n\n646 MARCO IANNIRUBERTO, JOS\u00e9 E.G.

(2009) \ndescribed the sedimentological and alluvial \narchitecture of a large braid bar in the Paran\u00e1 \nRiver and pointed to the few sedimentological \ndata available for large rivers due to the logistic \ndifficulty of monitoring such channels.\n\nTo date, the vast majority of river sedimentology \nstudy has relied on two main categories of \nobservation: shallow trenches, cut faces and cores, \nor the application of shallow geophysical methods \non dry and shallow regions of braid bars. A variety \nof geophysical methods have been applied to study \nfluvial environments, providing the description of \ndifferent characteristics and physical parameters. \n\nBaines et al. (2002) showed the applicability \nof ERI (Electrical Resistivity Imaging) to map the \ngeometry of gravel and sand river channel-fills \nburied in an environment where GPR penetration was \nhampered by the presence of clay and silt. Hirsch et \nal. (2008) carried out a comparison among different \ngeophysical methods and observed that while ERI \nwas capable of detecting changes in sediment types \nand boundaries, GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar) \nshowed the internal structure of a river terrace \nsite, and this capability was used in many studies \nof alluvial river deposits (Sambrook Smith et al. \n2006, Hugenholtz et al. 2007, Sambrook Smith et \nal. 2009). On the other hand, high-resolution seismic \nis a well established methodology to study internal \nsedimentary facies in a variety of environments (eg: \nHofmann et al. 2006, Novak and Bjorck 2002).\n\nSuch methods allowed the study of mor-\nphological facies and the internal structure of \nsand bars and dunes in both marine and fluvial \nenvironments in order to describe recent and \nancient depositional sequences, as well as to gather \ndata for sedimentological modelling.\n\nIn this study, a sub-bottom profiler was used to \ninvestigate stratigraphy of the lower course of the \nTocantins River, in the Amazon region, between the \n\ncity of Tucuru\u00ed and the village of Nazar\u00e9 dos Patos. \nThe interest in this specific region lies on the possible \nvariation of the fluvial regime due to the installation \nof the dam of the Tucuru\u00ed hydroelectric plant and the \nperspective that such river would become navigable \nas soon as the canal lock will be completed.\n\nIn most cases the construction of a dam \nimplies in a reduction of the liquid discharge, as a \nconsequence of storage and evaporation losses, as \nwell as the capacity of sediment transport (Brandt \n2000). In terms of sediment discharge, Williams \nand Wolman (1984 apud Brandt 2000) estimated the \nsediment retention efficiency for large reservoirs to \nbe greater than 99% for the bed load as a result the \ntransport capacity of a flow downstream of a dam is \nlarger than the effective load.\n\nUsing the notation of Brandt (2000), where Q \nis the water discharge, L the solid load transported \nand k the transport capacity, the branch of the \nTocantins River downstream the Tucuru\u00ed dam can \nbe classified as Case 1 (reduced Q and L &lt;K). In this \ncase, an adjust in the transversal section of the canal \ncan occur, showing the degradation of the river bed \nand the erosion of margins, being the equilibrium \ndetermined by the relative erodibility between the \nbed and margins of the river (Brandt 2000). The \nlength of the branch affected by degradation also \ndepends on these factors, as well as the sediment \ntransport of the tributaries downstream the dam.\n\nIn the study area it is possible to recognize \nthe first stretch downstream the dam (Fig. 1), with \nabout 18 km length, as a straight type, while further \ndownstream the river becomes anastomosed, with \nincreasing sinuosity downstream the dam.\n\nRegarding the hydrossedimentological cha-\nracterization, according to Lima et al. (2004) this \nstretch of the Tocantins River shows low suspended \nsediment concentration and discharge. Based on \nmeasurements taken at the Tucuru\u00ed station from \n1981 to 1998, the mentioned author reports mean \nvalues of 9 mg/L for sediment concentration and \n8.388 tons/day for suspended sediment discharge. \n\n\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2012) 84 (3)\n\n647 ARCHITECTURAL RIVERBED FACIES OF THE TOCANTINS RIVE\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the same parameters \nmeasured at the Itupiranga station, upstream \nthe reservoir, are 48 mg/L and 46.737 tons/\nday, respectively. The difference between the \ntwo stations is explained by the retention of the \nsuspended sediment load in the reservoir basin.\n\nSuch low values of suspended sediment load \ndownstream the dam lead to think that in this part \nof the river the sedimentation process is largely \ndetermined by bed load, being the dissolved \nload of minor importance in the Brazilian rivers \n(Christofoletti 1981).\n\nOn the other hand, downstream the dam, the \ndecrease of the suspended load turns the waters into \n\u201csediment starved\u201d, with the consequent erosion of \nmargins and the river bed until the local sediment \nproduction balances the transport potential of the \nflow (Williams and Wolman 1984).\n\nOn such basis, it is possible to infer that the \nfeatures detected in the seismic survey must be \nassociated to the period before the closing of the dam \nor originated from the erosion and re-mobilization \nof river bed forms downstream the dam.\n\nThe aim of this work is to describe acoustic \nand architectural facies of the river bed, associated \n\nto sediment transport and deposition mechanisms, \nconsidering the impact of such factors on the \ninstallation of a waterway.\n\nGEOLOGICAL SETTINGS\n\nThe study area is located in the center-north portion \nof Par\u00e1 State, at the occidental margin of the \nParna\u00edba Basin. The geological framework includes \nthe basement of the Parna\u00edba Basin, as well as the \nCainozoic successions related to the Barreiras \nGroup and the alluvium of the Tocantins River.\n\nAccording to Barbosa et al. (1966) and Rezende \n(1998), the area corresponds to a transition region \nbetween the crystalline basement - Xingu Complex, \nsituated in the left margin of the river, and a volcanic-\nsedimentary sequence with low metamorphic grade \nrelated to the Tucuru\u00ed Formation. The Paleogene \ndeposits, as well as quaternary sediments, compose \nthe alluvium.

The top of Unit 1 is a strong and \ncontinuous reflector (Fig. 2-a), interpreted as \nthe acoustic basement (bedrock). The surface of \nsuch unit shows an evident roughness (Fig. 2-b), \nwhich influences the turbulence of the flow and \nthe transport of the bed load. The outcrops indicate \nerosion areas or sediment by-pass. Topographical \ndepressions of the exposed basement can cause \nsediment retention (Fig. 2-c).\n\nThe top of Unit 2 is formed by a continuous and \nregular reflector, with several parallel layers (Fig. 2-e) or \ncross stratifications (Fig. 2-f), interpreted as top of bars \ncomposed of well-sorted layers of fine to medium sand \nseparated by layers of coarser and poorly sorted sand. \nThe internal reflections show parallel or sub-parallel \nreflections, marked by the presence of prograding \nclinoforms, oblique sigmoid bodies and large scale \n(decameters) parallel and crossed stratification, related \nto planes of deposition reactivation.\n\nThe contact between Unit 1 and 2 occurs in a \ngradual transition region (Fig. 2-d), where the width \nof sediments increases with the transition from the \nplane bed (Fig. 2-e) to transversal bars (Fig. 2-f), as \na consequence of increased sediment load.\n\nLithostratigraphic \nunits\n\nChronostratigraphy\nMain \n\nLithotypes\n\nTUCUNAR\u00e9 \nGROUP\n\nQUATERNARY\nUnconsolidated \n\nsand\n\nBARREIRAS \nGROUP\n\nPALEOCENE\nSandstone, \n\ngraywacke and \nconglomerate\n\nVOLCANO-\nSEDIMENTARY \n\nSEQUENCE\nNEOPROTEROzOIC\n\nSchists and \namphibolites\n\nTOCANTINS \nGROUP TUCURU\u00cd \n\nFORMATION\nMESOPROTEROzOIC\n\nMetabasalts, \nschists and \n\namphibolites\n\nXINGU \nCOMPLEX\n\nARCHEAN / \nPALEOPROTEROzOIC\n\nGneisses e \nmigmatites\n\nTABLE I\nStratigraphy synthesis of the central region of Par\u00e1 State, Brazil.\n\nDifferential GPS) receiver and navigation suite. \nThe WADGPS is a satellite broadcast technique of \nGPS differential corrections that allows attaining \nsub-meter accuracy \n\nThe Edgetech 3100P sub-bottom profiler, \nequipped with the tow-vehicle SB-216, was operated \nwith a \u201cchirp\u201d pulse of bandwidth 2-15kHz, and \nachieved a penetration up to 10 m in sandy bottom, \nwith about 10 cm resolution.\n\nAccurate positioning was obtained by using the \nDGPS receiver Trimble DSM 232 with the satellite \ndifferential correction Omnistar HP, attaining \naccuracy of about 20cm on average.\n\nPositioning and seismic systems were interfaced \nvia Hypack navigation software, which allowed real \ntime referencing of the seismic profiles, as well as \nthe survey planning and the on-line navigation.\n\nThe survey was carried out along navigation \nlines parallel to the river canal (thalweg), and \nsome transversal lines were run to verify the cross-\ncontinuity of sedimentary structures.\n\nMore than 120 km of seismic lines were \nacquired in a stretch of about 40 km between the \ncity of Tucuru\u00ed and the village of Nazar\u00e9 dos Patos.\n\nFigure 2 - Typical acoustic interfaces of Unit 1 and 2.\n\nThe seismic records clearly show the internal \nstructure of river bars, where the variation of acoustic \nimpedance that generates the reflections must be due \nto changes in the sedimentation regime associated \nto cyclic events.

The pelitic materials \n(silt and clay) are certainly present in the deposition \nsystems as a whole, but its sedimentation is limited to \ninundation flats, which were not included in this paper \nthat focused the study on the active river channel.\n\nIn the surveyed portion of the active channel it \nwas possible to detect three conditions of transport-\ndeposition, including by-pass areas, with enhanced \nerosion and transport, deposition areas, with the \naccumulation of sand in different flow conditions, \nand transition areas associated to the interposition \nof the former ones.\n\nAs the resolution of the seismic survey only \ndetects forms thicker than 10 cm and that extend \nfor at least a few meters, the architectural elements \n\nwill be described according to the fluvial facies \ndenomination proposed by Miall (1978, 1985).\n\nAlong the river, downstream the Tucuru\u00ed dam, \nthe following sand facies dominate: St (cross-stratified \nsandstone), Sp (planar cross-stratified sandstone), Sh \n(horizontally stratified or laminated sandstone) and \nSe (sandstone in erosional channel). Regarding the \narchitectural elements, the following bed forms are \nobserved: sandy bed-forms (SB), channel element \n(CH), downstream accretion element (DA), lateral \naccretion (LA) and laminated sand sheets (LS).\n\nIt is worth mentioning that, as distinct bedforms \nare strictly linked to the paleo-topography of the \nbedrock, and according to the observation of \nseismic profiles where the bedrock is detectable, \nbeds of dunes and bars are associated to an irregular \nbedrock topography.\n\nExamples of seismic profiles in different con-\ntexts, with the respective description of facies and \nsedimentary processes are described below. Both \nvertical and horizontal scales on profiles are in meters.\n\nBy-Pass Environments\n\nIn the by-pass environments, the erosion processes \ndominate the transport via mechanisms such as \ntraction and suspension. Generally, in such enviro-\nnments, the bedrock is locally exposed and the depth \nreaches 20m. The by-pass environments are mostly \nobserved in the main canals, and seldom occur \n\n\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2012) 84 (3)\n\n650 MARCO IANNIRUBERTO, JOS\u00e9 E.G. CAMPOS and VITTO C.M. ARA\u00faJO\n\nnear the margins. The main canals can occur in the \ncentral portion of the current fl uvial bed, but in other \ncases they can result in strong asymmetries, with the \nthalweg displaced towards one of the margins.\n\nFigure 4 shows an example of a by-pass enviro-\nnment, where the riverbed shows a rough profi le, \nand there are no refl ectors indicating sediment \naccumulation. In Figure 4 there is a clear tendency \nthat highlights the inclined planes towards the North \n(slant dashed lines), which are interpreted as schist \nfoliation planes or a high-density fracture system.\n\nChannels deeper than 10m can occur locally, \nbeing interpreted as the product of a combined \naction of fl ow turbulence and current vortices. \nFigure 5 shows an example of such structure. It is \nalso possible to observe the structural trend present \nin the bedrock. In the NNE section, at a depth \nslightly more than 10m, a small channel fi lled with \nsand can be observed.\n\nAt the frontal portion of the bars the refl ectors \npresent an inclination towards the deeper part of the \nchannel, showing the migration tendency of such \nmacroforms, which represent the depositional areas \nthat result in longitudinal accretion architectural \nelements (DA) composed of Sh, St and Sp facies \ntype. The sedimentary process dominating the \nformation of the macroforms is of traction and \nsaltation type, in which the deposition occurs \nbecause of the gradual decrease of energy.\n\nIt is interesting to observe that the bar in the \ncenter of Figure 7 (vertical exaggeration 6:1) has \n\nFigure 4 - Example of a seismic profi le of rocky bed exhibiting likely \nstructural trend foliation or high density fracturing (dashed lines).\n\nis rocky. Such feature is associated to the region of \nbedrock weakness (fault zone or contact of rocks \nwith different resistance to erosion).\n\nFigure 5 - Image showing a valley in a rocky outcrop due to sediment \nby pass in an area of large depth gradients.\n\nDeposition Environments\n\nFigure 7 represents a series of longitudinal bars, \nwith internal refl ectors that defi ne plane-parallel \nlayers (dashed lines) that can be internally \nlaminated or compose sets of cross layers of a \nlower order (dotted lines).\n\nFigure 6 - Example of a partially fi lled wide erosion canal sculptured \nin the bedrock. \n\nFigure 7 - Example of bar structures composing an architectural \nelement of longitudinal accretion. \n\nWhen the fl uvial channel becomes deeper that \n20m, the reduced fl ow and transport capacity allow \nthe beginning of deposition processes. Figure 6 \nshows an example of such environment where in \nthe center of the valley occurs the fi lling with coarse \nsandy materials or the mixing of sand and silt. At \nthe North and South of the channel, the river bed \n\n\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2012) 84 (3)\n\n651 ARCHITECTURAL RIVERBED FACIES OF THE TOCANTINS RIVE\n\nabout 6m height relative to the thalweg, with a \nslope of the slip face of about 50% (27\u00b0).\n\nThe example in Figure 8 shows a site with thin \na deposition directly above the acoustic basement \n(dash-dot line), which is here characterized by an \nirregular topography. In this case, horizontal layers \n(dashed lines) dominate the internal bar structure. \nThe undulated top of the bedform (continuous \nline) shows a set of transversal bars, orthogonal \nto the main migration direction of the flow, which \nrepresent a sequence of architectural elements of \nlateral accretion with the migration of sandy facies \ndue to the grain traction.\n\nFigure 8 - Example of macro-undulation bedforms with a transversal \nsand bar migration. Sand bars show plane-parallel layering.\n\nof cut-and-fill bearing facies and channels changes \nto cross and horizontal strata.\n\nFigure 10 illustrates a case in which a \nsuccession of architectural facies of channel type \n(CH), with the predominance of Se facies at SSW, \nmigrates to architectural elements of longitudinal \naccretion (DA) towards NNE, with the dominance \nof sandy St and Sp facies type. The abrupt increase \nin depth observed in the NNE part of the profile is \ninterpreted as a recent erosional channel.\n\nSome profiles, as illustrated in Figure 9, show \nbig clinoforms that highlight the time line, with \nthe longitudinal bedforms migration arranged in \nmacro undulations. The most evident reflectors \nare interpreted as sedimentation reactivation plans \n(dashed lines), with a strong seasonal periodicity \nand the widespread dominance of St and Sp facies \ntype (dotted lines).\n\nIn the SW portion of the profile the bar \ntop shows a series of dunes as a response to the \nflow turbulence. In the NE side of the profile the \nhorizontal bedding is considered as an evidence of \npredominant laminar flow, which gives origin to the \narchitectural element of laminated sand (LS) type.\n\nThe variation on the flow regime and current \nnature that changes from laminar to turbulent is \nconfirmed by the presence of sections in which a set \n\nFigure 9 - Lateral channel migration deposits represented by big size \nclinoforms with deposition of sand and graywakes.\n\nFigure 10 - Region with evident superposition of directional fluxes \nthat give origin to cut-and-fill channels.

At both NE and SW \nends, excellent examples of large cut-and-fill \nchannels (dotted lines), limited by continuous and \nevident reflectors, are evident.\n\nIn areas of minor depth (about 5m) and more \nuniform currents, the bedforms are composed by \na set of transversal bars with varying length and \n\n\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2012) 84 (3)\n\n652 MARCO IANNIRUBERTO, JOS\u00e9 E.G.

In 3-D, such fea-tures appear \nas linguoids with a superimposed asymmetrical dune \nsystem. Internally such bars show plane-parallel \nlayers with cross and horizontal laminations.\n\nThe bedform migration due to the traction \nflow is considered as the main transport component \nin such sections where both macroforms and \nmesoforms migrate downstream.\n\nTransition Environments\n\nTransition environments are formed in intermediate \nareas between depositional and by-pass enviro-\nnments and can occur along the longitudinal axis \nof the river, as well as transversal to the active \ncanal. Two factors control the deposition in these \nenvironments: resistance variation of the local \nbasement material and lateral/longitudinal changes \nof energy and current strength.\n\nFigure 12 presents an example of a transition \nenvironment characterized by irregular basement \ntopography (dash-dot line), in which sedimentary \ndeposit thickness varies from sub meter to more \nthan 10m downstream. This set forms architectural \nfacies classified as sandy bed (SB) with large \ndominance of Sh and Sl facies (dashed lines).\n\nLocally, the transition environments are \nobserved downstream of long stretches of rocky \nbed, and present complex sequences of sandy \nfacies, with dipping reflectors forming sigmoids \nindicating the balance between flux energy and \n\nFigure 11 - Sand layer deposits with large cut-and-fill channels at SW \nand NW section ends. \n\nFigure 12 - Sandy sedimentary layers over an acoustic basement \ncharacterized by irregular paleo-topography.

In the \nfirst eighteen kilometers downstream the dam, \nseismic records show the predominance of by-\npass environments possibly related to erosional \neffect of sediment unsaturated flux. Further \ndownstream, the equilibrium in the sedimentary \nload could have been re-established by the erosion \nof both bedrock and river margins. Here seismic \nrecords show the continuous presence of sandy \ntransversal channel bars.\n\nThe methodology used showed that high-\nresolution seismic profilers could be used to study \nthe internal structure of sand bars in alluvial river \nchannels. Collected data show the impressive \nvariety and complexity of architectural elements \nand internal structure of sandy macroforms.\n\nThe results allowed the identification of three \nmain environments linked to channel sedimentation \nprocesses: by-pass, transition and deposition \nenvironments whose distribution is related to \nchannel dynamics and bedrock topography. The \napplication of the study is manifold once it provides \nnot only an insight into sedimentary structure \nof alluvial forms and sedimentation history, but \nalso elements demanded to planning eventual \nengineering works for river navigability.\n\nFurthermore, the results encourage developing \nfurther this kind of research, including integration \nof GPR methods to study emerged alluvial bars and \ncoring to provide information on time-evolution of \nsedimentation processes.\n\n\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2012) 84 (3)\n\n654 MARCO IANNIRUBERTO, JOS\u00e9 E.G.
