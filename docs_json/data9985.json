Por este motivo, o estudo dos \n\nprocessos de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de biopl\u00e1sticos tem sido alvo de pesquisa intensiva de \n\nforma a conseguir alcan\u00e7ar a otimiza\u00e7\u00e3o e redu\u00e7\u00e3o dos custos de produ\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndestes materiais. Neste contexto, o estudo da produ\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\npolihidroxialcanoatos (PHAs) por culturas microbianas mistas (MMC) faz todo o \n\nsentido. Neste trabalho, o processo de tr\u00eas passos foi testado para a produ\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde PHA. Numa primeira etapa, um subproduto da ind\u00fastria papeleira, o licor de \n\ncozimento ao sulfito \u00e1cido (HSSL) foi submetido a fermenta\u00e7\u00e3o acidog\u00e9nica \npara produzir uma mistura rica em \u00e1cidos gordos vol\u00e1teis (VFAs), que foi \n\nusada como substrato nas duas etapas seguintes. Na segunda etapa, a MMC \n\nrecolhida numa esta\u00e7\u00e3o de tratamento de \u00e1guas residuais (WWTP) foi \n\nsubmetida a condi\u00e7\u00f5es de alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o din\u00e2mica aer\u00f3bia (ADF) num reator \n\ndescont\u00ednuo sequencial (SBR), de forma a selecionar os organismos \n\nacumuladores de PHA. Um estado pseudo-estacion\u00e1rio foi atingido ap\u00f3s 60 \n\ndias de opera\u00e7\u00e3o do SBR. Num terceiro passo, a capacidade da MMC \n\nselecionada em acumular PHA foi testada. A MMC atingiu um m\u00e1ximo de \n\nacumula\u00e7\u00e3o de PHA de 47,1%. \n\nA comunidade bacteriana foi analisada por fluorescence in situ hybridization \n\n(FISH). Foram identificadas bact\u00e9rias pertencentes aos seguintes grupos: \n\nBeta- (44,7 \u00b1 2,7%), Alfa- (13,6 \u00b1 1,3%) e Gammaproteobacteria (2,40 \u00b1 1,1%) \n\ne Bacteroidetes (9,20 \u00b1 3,8%). \n\nA n\u00edvel de g\u00e9nero, dentro da classe Betaproteobacteria, uma quantidade \n\nconsider\u00e1vel de Acidovorax (25,9 \u00b1 3,1%) foi encontrada e foram detectadas \n\nem pequenas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es Thauera (0,72 \u00b1 0,25%) e Azoarcus (0,62 \u00b1 \n\n0,02%). Defluvicoccus relacionada com organismos formadores de t\u00e9tradas \n\n(0,75 \u00b1 0,53%), pertencendo \u00e0 classe Alphaproteobacteria, foram detectadas \n\nem pequena quantidade. \n\nUma biblioteca de clones foi preparada e v\u00e1rios clones foram identificados \n\ncomo organismos previamente descritos como produtores de PHA. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n\n \nPolyhydroxyalkanoates, Mixed Microbial Culture, HSSL, Aerobic Dynamic \nFeeding, FISH, PCR, 16S rDNA  \n\nabstract \n\n \nCurrently one of the greatest concerns worldwide focuses on the development \n\nof new sustainable materials that can be used to replace petroleum-based \n\nproducts. For this reason, the study of the production of bioplastics has been \n\nsubjected to considerable research in order to achieve process optimization \n\nand production costs reduction. In this context, the study of the production of \n\npolyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) by mixed microbial cultures (MMC) is worthwhile.  \n\nIn this work, the three-step process was tested for PHA production. In a first \n\nstep, a feedstock of the paper industry, hardwood sulphite spent liquor (HSSL) \n\nwas submitted to acidogenic fermentation in order to produce a mixture rich in \n\nvolatile fatty acids (VFAs), which was used as substrate in the next two steps. \n\nIn the second step, a MMC collected from a wastewater treatment plant \n\n(WWTP) was submitted to Aerobic Dynamic Feeding (ADF) conditions in a \n\nSequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) in order to select PHA-accumulating \n\norganisms. A pseudo-stationary state was reached after 60 days of SBR \n\noperation. In the third step, the ability of the selected MMC to accumulate PHA \n\nwas tested. The selected MMC reached a maximum PHA content of 47.1%.  \n\nThe bacterial community was analysed through fluorescence in situ \n\nhybridization (FISH). Bacteria belonging to the four main classes were \n\nidentified: Beta- (44.7 \u00b1 2.7%), Alpha- (13.6 \u00b1 1.3%) and Gammaproteobacteria \n\n(2.40 \u00b1 1.1%) and Bacteroidetes (9.20 \u00b1 3.8%). \n\nRegarding the genus level, inside the Betaproteobacteria, a considerable \n\namount of Acidovorax (25.9 \u00b1 3.1%) was found and only small amounts of \n\nThauera (0.72 \u00b1 0.25%) and Azoarcus (0.62 \u00b1 0.02%) were detected. \n\nDefluvicoccus related to Tetrad Forming Organisms (0.75 \u00b1 0.53%) belonging \n\nto Alphaproteobacteria was detected in small amount. \n\nA clone library was prepared and several clones were identified as organisms \n\nalready described as PHA-producers. \n\n\n\n 1 \n\nContents \n\n1.

Introduction \n\nPlastics present versatile qualities of strength, lightness, durability and resistance to \n\ndegradation. They have become an important material to enhance the comfort and quality \n\nof life. Plastics are an essential part of almost all industries and have replaced glass and \n\npaper in packaging. However, these very desirable properties have now become their \n\ngreatest problem (Khanna and Srivastava 2004). The exponential growth of the human \n\npopulation has led to the accumulation of huge amounts of non-degradable waste materials \n\nacross our planet. Living conditions in the biosphere are therefore changing dramatically, \n\nin such a way that the presence of non-biodegradable residues is affecting the potential \n\nsurvival of many species (Luengo et al 2003). As the conventional plastics derive from oil, \n\nother problems were raised. The limitation of oil reserves and the instability in oil prices \n\nare two of the drawbacks of the consumption of these resources (da Costa Sousa et al \n\n2009). In addition, several environmental changes are being caused by the rise of \n\ngreenhouse gases emissions (Jefferson 2006). In response to the harmful effects of plastics \n\non the environment, there is a considerable interest in the development of biodegradable \n\nmaterials (Choi and Lee 1997). Among the various biodegradable polymeric materials, \n\npolyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) attracted industrial attention because of their potential use \n\nas practical biodegradable and biocompatible thermoplastics (Tsuge 2002).  \n\nAlthough PHAs are relatively well characterized in terms of properties and market \n\napplications, their price is still higher than that of synthetic plastics (Chanprateep 2010). \n\nTo lower polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production costs, genetic engineering technology, \n\npathway modification or synthetic biology approaches should be engaged to develop PHA-\n\nproducing strains able to grow to high cell density within a short period of time on lower \n\ncost substrates under less demanding fermentation conditions (Chen 2009).  \n\nCurrently, industrial PHA production relies on pure microbial culture fermentation \n\ntechnology with high costs associated with carbon substrate, fermentation operation and \n\ndownstream processing (Albuquerque et al 2011). In the last two decades, research has \n\nfocused on the development of alternatives to substantially decrease PHA production costs \n\n(Serafim et al 2008a). The combined use of waste organic carbon and mixed microbial \n\ncultures (MMC) could significantly decrease the price of PHAs, allowing to save energy, \n\nsince no sterilization is required, reducing production costs and minimizing the need for \n\n\n\n12 \n\ncontrol equipment (Johnson et al 2010). \n\nTaking into account the emergency in developing alternatives to conventional \n\nplastics and the increasing potential in using MMCs and real substrates to produce PHAs, \n\nthis research as emerged. The main objectives of this research were: \n\n? Operation of a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) under aerobic dynamic feeding \n\n(ADF) conditions in order to select a stable PHA-accumulating culture; \n\n? Test the ability of the selected culture to accumulate PHA through several batch \n\ntests, using as substrate the VFA-rich effluent from the acidogenic fermentation \n\nreactor (AFR); \n\n?

Bioplastics \n\nPlastics are present in our daily life in the form of disposable utensils, packaging, \n\nfurniture or appliances, thereby improving our quality of life and comfort. Over the past \n\nyears, the use of plastics in packaging and other products exacerbated the problem of solid \n\nwaste disposal. The slow rate of degradation of these plastics results is a serious pollution \n\nproblem, since they persist in the environment for an average of 100 years. For these \n\nreasons, petrochemical-based plastics are accumulated in the environment at a rate of 25 \n\nmillion tonnes/year (Lee et al 1991; Castilho et al 2009). \n\nPlastic disposal is often problematic. In landfills, the degradation is very slow and \n\nincineration is expensive and generates toxic gas emissions (Reddy et al 2003; Khanna and \n\nSrivastava 2004). Recycling is difficult because it requires a preliminary screening for \n\nseparation of different types of plastics and the process itself results in changes in polymer \n\nproperties (Castilho et al 2009). Moreover, the presence of a wide variety of additives such \n\nas pigments, coatings, fillers, limits the use of the recycled material (Khanna and \n\nSrivastava 2004). In response to this problem and to the harmful effects of plastic wastes \n\non the environment, there is considerable interest in the development of bio-based and \n\nbiodegradable alternatives. \n\nBiomaterials are natural products that are synthesized and/or catabolized by \n\ndifferent organisms with a great interest from a biotechnological point of view (Luengo et \n\nal 2003). These biopolymers can be extracted directly from natural resources or chemically \n\npolymerized from organic monomers. Apart from being considered biodegradable, as \n\nvarious microorganisms can assimilate them, they are also biocompatible, since they do \n\nnot show any toxicity to the human body (Luengo et al 2003). As such, they have several \n\nadvantages over any other synthetic product (Khanna and Srivastava 2004). \n\n2.2. PHAs \n\nIn 1888, Beijerinck was the first to observe PHAs granules in bacterial cells. A few \n\nyears later, in 1926, Lemoigne described the composition of a PHAs as a homopolyester of \n\n3-hydroxybutyric acid, to which he gave the name of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (P(3HB)) \n\n(Lemoigne, 1926). \n\nPHAs are aliphatic polyesters mostly constituted by monomers of 3-\n\n\n\n14 \n\nhydroxyalkanoates. They are produced under specific environmental and nutritional \n\nconditions and accumulated intracellularly as amorphous granules or inclusion bodies. The \n\naccumulated polymer allows for the survival of microorganisms in the absence of \n\nsubstrate, as they function as intracellular reserves of carbon and energy (Luengo et al \n\n2003; Verlinden et al 2007; Serafim et al 2008a). PHAs are synthesized by living \n\norganisms such as bacteria, fungi or plants and more than 250 species of microorganisms \n\nare known to have this capability (Lee 1995). Bacteria are used in the large scale \n\nproduction of PHAs (Verlinden et al 2007). All the industrial processes so far implemented \n\nuse pure microbial cultures which may accumulate PHAs up to 90% of the cell dry weight \n\n(Lee and Choi 1998; Madison and Huisman 1999). \n\nThe general chemical structure of the PHAs monomers is represented in Figure 1 \n\nand some examples of PHAs polymers are shown in Table 1. In the homopolymer P(3HB), \n\nn is equal to 1 and R is a methyl group. This is the most common and best-characterized \n\nPHA (Dias et al 2006; Castilho et al 2009). Typically, PHAs have high molecular weights, \n\nbetween 50,000 to 1,000,000 Da (Reddy et al 2003). PHAs can be divided into three \n\ngroups in function of the number of carbons: short-chain-length PHAs (scl-PHAs) with 3 \n\nto 5 carbons, medium-chain-length PHAs (mcl-PHAs), which vary between 6 to 14 \n\ncarbons and long-chain-length PHAs (lcl-PHAs), with more than 14 carbons (Singh and \n\nMallick 2008).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Chemical structure of PHAs monomers (Reddy et al 2003) \n\n \nTable 1. PHAs and corresponding R-groups (Verlinden et al 2007) \n\nR-group Full name Short name \n\nCH3 Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) P(3HB) \n\nCH2CH3 Poly(3-hydroxyvalerate) P(3HV) \n\nCH2CH2CH3 Poly(3-hydroxyhexanoate) PHHx \n\n \n\nThere are many types of PHAs with different monomer compositions, which \n\ninfluence the physical and mechanical properties of PHAs (Khanna and Srivastava 2004). \n\nP(3HB) has a low oxygen permeability and better thermoplastic properties when compared \n\n\n\n 15 \n\nto petroleum-based plastics, but has poor mechanical properties, since it is more rigid and \n\nbrittle that polypropylene (PP) (Sudesh and Iwata 2008). It is well known that P(3HB) \n\nhomopolymer and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (P(3HB-co-3HV)) \n\ncopolymers of low hydroxyvalerate (HV) content are stiff and brittle, with poor impact \n\nstrength, because of the relatively high crystallinity of the materials. This brittleness has \n\nbeen a reported obstacle to the practical applications of these materials, and significant \n\nresearch effort has been devoted to manipulating these mechanical properties. One of the \n\nmost direct solutions for improving mechanical properties of PHAs is the incorporation of \n\nhigh contents of HV monomer, which results in a copolymer more elastic and flexible \n\n(Serafim et al 2004; Bengtsson et al 2008b).  \n\nCompared to P(3HB), P(3HB-co-3HV) copolymers with higher HV contents have \n\ndecreased stiffness and brittleness, increased flexibility (higher elongation to break), and \n\nincreased tensile strength and toughness (Laycock et al 2013). The presence and relative \n\nproportion of each monomer depend on the type of substrate supplied. Mixtures of \n\nsubstrates are generally used to obtain copolymers with different monomer compositions, \n\naiming at the tailored synthesis of PHA with given target mechanical properties (Dias et al \n\n2006). \n\nPHAs can be degraded under anaerobic and aerobic conditions by various \n\nmicroorganisms in many ecosystems such as soil, sewage, sea water or lakes (Lee 1995; \n\nCastilho et al 2009). It has been found that the rate of biodegradability of PHAs in natural \n\nenvironments is influenced by factors such as type of microbial population, temperature, \n\nmoisture level, pH, nutrient supply as well as composition, crystallinity, additives and \n\nsurface area of PHA itself (Khanna and Srivastava 2004). \n\n Another important property of PHAs is their biocompatibility. This means that \n\nPHAs are not toxic to the human body and its degradation does not result in any toxic \n\ncompound (Castilho et al 2009). This feature allows for the use of PHAs in numerous \n\nmedical applications, since they are assimilated harmlessly by the human body (Verlinden \n\net al 2007). \n\nThere are several types of PHAs, such as BiopolTM, BiomerTM, NodaxTM and \n\nBiocycleTM. These polymers are produced by natural pure cultures of Alcaligenes latus \n\n(BiomerTM) and Bacillus spp. (BiocyclesTM) or by genetically modified strains of \n\nEscherichia coli (BiopolTM) or Cupriavidus necator (NodaxTM) (Singh and Mallick 2008; \n\n\n\n16 \n\nChen 2009).  \n\nThe application of PHAs in commodities depends on three core mechanical \n\nproperties: elongation at break, which is a measure of toughness or total deformation \n\nbefore fracture; Young\u2019s modulus which is a measure of stiffness; and ultimate tensile \n\nstrength, which is a measure of strength prior to the onset of permanent plastic deformation \n\n(Laycock et al 2013).

Applications of PHAs \n\nLike the petrochemical-based synthetic plastics, most PHAs are thermoplastics and \n\ncan be thermally processed using existing technologies in the plastic industry. The \n\nproperties of PHAs can also be tailored to suit numerous applications ranging from stiff \n\npackaging goods to highly elastic materials for coatings (Sudesh and Iwata 2008). PHAs \n\napplications can be divided into three areas: industrial, agricultural and medical (Philip et \n\nal 2007). The use of PHAs in industry has been gaining territory (Sudesh and Iwata 2008). \n\nInitially, PHAs were used to make everyday articles such as shampoo bottles and \n\npackaging materials. In recent times, other applications were added, such as medical \n\nimplants, drug delivery carriers, printing and photographic materials, fine chemicals and \n\nnutritional supplements (Chen 2009).  Due to their piezoelectric nature, it is also possible \n\n\n\n 17 \n\nto use PHAs to make pressure sensors, stretch and acceleration measuring instruments, \n\nshock wave sensors and lighters. The gas barrier property of P(3HB-co-3HV) is useful for \n\napplications in food packaging and for making plastic beverage bottles (Philip et al 2007).  \n\nIn agriculture, PHAs are used in the production of devices for controlled release of \n\nfertilizers, herbicides and insecticides (Philip et al 2007). They can also be used as \n\nbacterial inoculants used to enhance nitrogen fixation in plants (Kadouri et al 2005), \n\nencapsulation of seeds, biodegradable films for crop protection or in the construction of \n\ngreenhouses (Verlinden et al 2007).  \n\nDue to their properties of biodegradability and biocompatibility, several medical \n\napplications were already developed. PHAs can be turned into drug controlled release \n\nmatrices. PHAs monomers, especially hydroxybutyrate (HB), were found to have \n\ntherapeutic effects on Alzheimer and Parkinson, osteoporosis and even memory \n\nimprovement (Chen 2009). PHAs are used in tissue engineering, artificial organ \n\nconstruction, surgical sutures and surgical glue (Philip et al 2007; Wu et al 2009). \n\nThe primary obstacle for the replacement of synthetic plastics by biopolymers is \n\ntheir significant cost difference; the P(3HB) cost ranges from 2.5\u20133.0 \u20ac/kg (Chanprateep \n\n2010) up to 12 \u20ac/kg (Castilho et al 2009), and the copolymer P(3HB-co-3HV) cost can also \n\nrange from 3.0\u20135.0 \u20ac/kg (Chanprateep 2010) to 12 \u20ac/kg (Castilho et al 2009), compared \n\nwith a cost of less than 1 \u20ac/kg (Chanprateep 2010) for conventional petroleum-based \n\npolymers. \n\n2.4. PHAs production \n\n2.4.1. Producing microorganisms \n\nThe selection of a microorganism for the industrial production of PHAs should rely \n\non several factors including the cells\u2019 ability to utilize inexpensive carbon sources, growth \n\nand polymer synthesis rates, and maximum polymer storage content. Recovery of PHAs \n\nshould also be considered because it contributes significantly to the production costs \n\n(Khanna and Srivastava 2004). \n\nOver 150 different types of hydroxyalkanoate monomers have been identified, \n\nbeing synthesized by over 300 species (Reis et al 2011). The industrial production of PHAs \n\nis carried out by natural or recombinant pure cultures of microorganisms such as \n\nEscherichia coli, Alcaligenes latus, Bacillus spp., Cupriavidus necator, Aeromonas \n\n\n\n18 \n\nhydrophila, Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas oleovorans. The use of recombinant \n\nstrains allows to achieve higher yields with lower costs (Lemos et al 2006). However, the \n\nuse of pure cultures still has several disadvantages that can be overcome through the use of \n\nMMCs (Serafim et al 2008a). Several strains are commonly used for pilot and large-scale \n\nproduction of PHAs and the results obtained with these are resumed in Table 3. \n\n \n\nTable 3.

Pure cultures and Mixed Microbial Cultures \n\nMMCs have emerged as an alternative to pure cultures since operating costs can be \n\nreduced by 50%. The use of MMCs combined with the reuse of industrial or agricultural \n\nby-products can reduce operating costs in 85% (Tsuge 2002). A variety of low cost carbon \n\nsubstrates (e.g., starch, tapioca hydrolysate, whey, and molasses) have been tested for PHA \n\nproduction by pure cultures, but PHA production costs remain very high, mainly due to \n\ninvestment and operating costs (Albuquerque et al 2007). The utilization of MMCs \n\nfacilitates the use of complex substrates since microbial population can adapt continuously \n\n\n\n 19 \n\nto changes in substrate. Moreover, there is no need for sterilization and sterile fermentation \n\nsystems, which contributes to the reduction of the final PHA price (Serafim et al 2004). \n\nThe process also reduces costs, since less sophisticated equipment is used and less control \n\nis needed (Lee 1995). MMCs do not have a defined composition and the selection process \n\ngradually enriches the culture in organisms of interest, by imposing certain operation \n\nconditions. The MMC selected for production of PHAs has a high PHA storage capacity \n\ndue to the operating conditions, which limits its primary metabolism (Dias et al 2006).  \n\nThe MMCs from Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTP) have the ability to \n\nproduce PHAs as storage of carbon and energy under transient conditions of availability of \n\nsubstrate. The MMCs have the ability to rapidly store the substrate when it is available, \n\nconverting it into PHA, which is consumed during famine phase (Serafim et al 2008a; \n\nCoats et al 2010). In addition, MMCs have the ability to adapt to substrates whose \n\ncomposition is unknown, allowing for the use of cheap substrates such as industrial wastes \n\n(Serafim et al 2008a).  \n\nJohnson et al. (2009) was able to maintain SBRs for PHA producing cultures \n\nenrichment running continuously for over 4 years under various conditions without \n\nstability problems (Johnson et al 2009). Serafim et al. (2008b) also reported a stable \n\nreactor performance of a PHA producing SBR for over 2 years (Serafim et al 2008b). \n\nWhile the risk of contamination is a big problem for pure culture processes, the use of an \n\nopen system for mixed culture PHA production actively supports the introduction of new \n\norganisms into the reactor that could potentially be more competitive PHA producers than \n\nthe established community (Johnson et al 2009). \n\nIn spite of the many efforts devoted in the last decades to improve this process, the \n\nvolumetric productivities and contents are still lower and than those achieved for pure \n\ncultures. Although the specific productivities are higher in MMC processes, cell \n\nconcentrations are below the values required to reach the volumetric productivities of the \n\npure culture processes (Serafim et al 2008a). Johnson et al. (2009) were able to select a \n\nvirtually pure culture highly enriched in PHA-accumulating organisms and demonstrating \n\na very high PHA storage capacity (up to 89%) by appropriately manipulating the operating \n\nconditions imposed on an open SBR fed with acetate (Johnson et al 2009).  \n\n\n\n20 \n\n2.4.3. Metabolism for PHA synthesis by MMCs \n\nThe metabolism for PHAs synthesis is well defined for pure cultures, but only a \n\nfew metabolic studies involving MMCs were reported (Lemos et al 2006). As such, it is \n\nassumed that the PHA production metabolism in MMCs is similar to the one described for \n\npure cultures (Dias et al. 2006).  \n\nThe feedstock used in PHAs production is normally enriched with volatile fatty \n\nacids (VFAs) and/or sugar-based compounds (Serafim et al 2008a). Acetate is the most \n\nwidely used substrate in the ADF process and it is preferably stored as P(3HB) (Serafim et \n\nal 2004). Figure 3 shows three metabolic pathways involved in the synthesis of PHAs.  \n\nFirstly, the organic acids molecules are transported across the cell membrane and \n\nactivated to the corresponding acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) or, for glucose, breakdown through \n\nglycolysis till acetyl-CoA (Serafim et al 2008a). There are three known possible pathways \n\nfor the production of PHAs that vary according to the substrate used. For acetate, two \n\nmolecules of acetyl-CoA condense to acetoacetyl-CoA by ?-ketothiolase. This product is \n\nreduced (by acetoacetyl-CoA reductase) to 3- hydroxybutyryl-CoA at the expense of \n\nconversion of reduced NADPH to NADP+. This monomer is the direct precursor for the \n\nsynthesis of P(3HB) by PHB synthase (Serafim et al 2008a). \n\nOn the other hand, when propionate is the substrate, three different precursors can \n\nbe produced. If two molecules of propionyl-CoA condense, they will originate 3-hydroxy-\n\n2-methylvaleryl-CoA, the precursor of poly-3-hydroxy-2-methylvalerate (P(3H2MV)). If \n\nacetyl-CoA is present or if is formed through the breakdown of propionyl-CoA, the \n\naddition of acetyl-CoA and propionyl may form poly-3-hydroxyvalerate (P(3HV)) or poly-\n\n3-hydroxy-2-methylbutyrate (P(3H2MB)) (Serafim et al 2008a). The propionate is \n\ncatalysed principally for the production of P(3HV), although some 3HB production can \n\noccur due to formation of its precursor, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, by the condensation of two \n\nmolecules of acetyl-CoA (Lemos et al 2006). Butyrate and valerate can be used for the \n\ndirect production of P(3HB) or P(3HV) (Serafim et al 2008a). \n\n   \n\n\n\n 21 \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Metabolic pathways for production of hydroxyalkanoate monomers for PHA synthesis  \n\n(Sudesh et al 2000) \n\n2.5. Three-step process \n\nDionisi et al. (2005c) developed a three-stage process for PHA production from \n\norganic wastes. During the first stage of acidogenic fermentation, a high-concentration \n\nbiodegradable waste is transformed into a mixture of acetate and other carboxylic acids. In \n\nthe second stage, a SBR is operated with periodic feeding in order to enrich the MMC in \n\nbacteria with a high storage response to be used in the third stage. The final stage is \n\noperated in batch, with an excess of external substrate in order to increase the MMC PHA \n\ncontent (Dionisi et al 2005c). Figure 3 shows a schematic representation of the three-step \n\nprocess. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3. Schematic representation of a three-stage process for PHA production from waste/surplus-based \n\nfeedstocks (Reis et al 2011) \n\n \n\n2.5.1. Acidogenic fermentation \n\nPHA production costs can be reduced if waste organic carbon sources are used as \n\nsubstrates. Many waste streams from agriculture and industry like cane and beet molasses, \n\ncheese whey, plant oils and hydrolysates of starch, cellulose and hemicellulose, are \n\npotentially useful substrates. When an open-culture system is used, not all substrates are \n\nequally suitable. For example, starch and cellulose hydrolysates could lead to the growth of \n\nglycogen-accumulating organisms. An alternative to overpass this problem is the anaerobic \n\ndigestion of the organic substrates, where soluble organic compounds are fermented into \n\norganic acids, such as acetic, propionic, butyric, and lactic acid, and other fermentation \n\nproducts, such as alcohols and hydrogen. This mixture of VFAs is readily converted to \n\nPHA (Carta et al 2001; Reis et al 2003; Salehizadeh and Van Loosdrecht 2004).  \n\nVFAs derived from waste feedstocks have important applications in addiction to \n\nserve as substrate for PHA production. Microbial production of organic acids is a \n\npromising approach for obtaining building-blocks from renewable carbon sources and \n\nVFAs are extremely useful as starting materials for the chemical industry (Sauer et al \n\n2008). \n\nThe acidogenic fermentation is an important step in anaerobic digestion of organic \n\ncompounds to methane and carbon dioxide. In this process, microbial species ferment \n\n\n\n 23 \n\ndissolved organic compounds into organic acids and other fermentation products, such as \n\nalcohols, under anaerobic conditions. Since the produced VFAs are also substrates for \n\nPHA production, acidogenic fermentation can serve as a suitable pre-treatment in the \n\nprocess of PHA production (Bengtsson et al 2008a). \n\nThe composition of the produced PHA depends on the types of VFAs that are used \n\nas substrate. Acetate and butyrate have a tendency to form 3HB monomers whereas \n\npresence of propionate tends to increase the amount of HV in the polymer (Dias et al 2006; \n\nCastilho et al 2009). The composition of VFAs produced under acidogenic fermentation \n\ncan be affected by conditions such as pH, retention time (RT) and temperature \n\n(Albuquerque et al 2010b). So, manipulating operating conditions of the anaerobic \n\nfermentation step can be used to control the biopolymer composition in the PHA \n\nproduction step (Albuquerque et al 2011). \n\nAlmost all the studies describing PHA production by MMCs perform culture \n\nselection and PHA accumulation in two separate steps (Dionisi et al 2003; Serafim et al \n\n2004; Dias et al 2006). Only few works report the use of a three-step production process, \n\nin which an anaerobic fermentation step precedes the culture selection and polymer \n\naccumulation steps. Bengtsson et al. (2008b) developed a three-step process for the \n\nproduction of PHA from paper mill effluents, including the continuous fermentation of the \n\npaper mill effluent followed by culture selection and PHA production using the fermented \n\neffluent as substrate (Bengtsson et al 2008b). Albuquerque and co-workers (2007) \n\ndeveloped a three-stage process to produce PHA from sugar cane molasses. The process \n\nincludes molasses acidogenic fermentation, selection of a PHA-accumulating culture and \n\nPHA batch accumulation using the enriched sludge and fermented molasses (Albuquerque \n\net al 2007). \n\nDifferent feedstocks were already investigated for acidogenic fermentation toward \n\nPHA production. These feedstocks include cheese whey, pulp and paper mill effluents \n\n(Bengtsson et al 2008a), sugarcane molasses (Albuquerque et al 2007) and olive oil mill \n\neffluents (OMEs) (Beccari et al 2009). Cheese whey, paper mill effluents, and sugarcane \n\nmolasses were all found to be readily and almost fully fermentable, producing mainly \n\nVFAs (acetate, propionate, butyrate, and valerate) as fermentation products (Albuquerque \n\net al 2007; Bengtsson et al 2008a). OMEs were fermented with a lower yield and the \n\nfermented stream contained both VFAs (acetic, propionic, and butyric acid) and alcohols \n\n\n\n24 \n\n(methanol, ethanol, and butanol) accounting for 32% and 22% of the overall COD, \n\nrespectively (Beccari et al 2009). \n\n2.5.2. Culture selection \n\nThe selection of a microbial population with a high storage capacity is one of the \n\nmain challenges in MMC processes (Serafim et al 2008a). If the selected population is very \n\nheterogeneous in terms of the storage capacity, that may have a negative impact in the \n\ndownstream process, since it would result in the reduction of average PHA cell content and \n\nincrease of PHA extraction costs. Thus, the operation of the selection reactor should be \n\noptimized to obtain a homogeneous population with a relatively high and stable storage \n\ncapacity rather than to maximize the PHA cell content (Serafim et al 2008a). The most \n\nimportant processes for culture selection are the Anaerobic/Aerobic process (AN/AE), the \n\nMicroAerophilic-Aerobic System (MAAS) and ADF. \n\nUnder AN/AE conditions, there are two main groups of bacteria responsible for \n\nPHA accumulation, which can be selected: polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) \n\nand glycogen-accumulating organisms (GAOs). In anaerobic conditions, these \n\nmicroorganisms use the carbon source for the production of PHA with simultaneous \n\nconsumption of glycogen. Under aerobic conditions, after the exhaustion of the external \n\nsubstrate, the stored PHA is consumed for growth, maintenance and replenishment of \n\nglycogen reserves (Serafim et al 2008a). According to Dai et al. (2007), in comparison \n\nwith PAOs, GAOs are more robust, reach higher PHA contents and easily produce \n\ncopolymers of P(3HB-co-3HV) from simple substrates (Dai et al 2007). Real substrates as \n\nfermented molasses (Pisco et al 2009), fermented wastewater (Coats et al 2007) and pre-\n\nfermented paper mill effluent (Bengtsson et al 2008b), were already tested in this kind of \n\nprocess and the obtained PHA accumulations were of 37%, 10-25%  and 48% (w/w), \n\nrespectively. \n\nSatoh et al. (1998) introduced the MAAS where a limited amount of oxygen is \n\nsupplied during the anaerobic period of anaerobic\u2013aerobic operations (Satoh et al 1998). In \n\nsuch conditions, microorganisms can take up organic substrates by obtaining energy \n\nthrough oxidative degradation of some part of the organic substrates. If the supply of \n\noxygen is sufficient, the microorganism may be able to get enough energy for assimilative \n\nactivities such as the production of protein, glycogen and other cellular components \n\nsimultaneously with taking up organic substrates. However, if the supply of oxygen is \n\n\n\n 25 \n\nadequately controlled, the assimilative activity will be suppressed while letting the \n\nmicroorganism accumulate PHA (Salehizadeh and Van Loosdrecht 2004).  \n\n Among the different processes described for industrial PHA production by MMCs, \n\nthe feast and famine process or ADF is the most promising because of the high sludge \n\nPHA content and productivity (Reis et al 2003). In this process, MMCs are subjected to \n\nalternating periods of presence (feast) and absence (famine) of substrate, which leads to an \n\nuneven growth of the MMC. The operation of the system with alternating phases of excess \n\ncarbon followed by substrate exhaustion imposes a selective pressure. During the famine \n\nphase, the absence of carbon causes the decrease of cellular components essential for \n\ngrowth, such as RNA and enzymes. After the starvation period, when an excess of carbon \n\nis supplied, the PHA storage is favoured, due to the low availability of material essential \n\nfor growth (Majone et al 1996). In the absence of substrate, only organisms able to store \n\nPHA will survive, since the stored polymer will be used as a source of carbon and energy \n\nto ensure growth and cell maintenance during famine phase (Dionisi et al 2003; Serafim et \n\nal 2004; Dias et al 2006). The ability to store internal reserves gives these microorganisms \n\na competitive advantage over those without this ability, when facing transient substrate \n\nsupply (Salehizadeh and Van Loosdrecht 2004). \n\nIn this process, the reactor is operated under intermittent substrate feed in order to \n\nfavour the polymer storage capacity. The substrate is fed during a short period of time, \n\nfollowed by a longer period of substrate absence. This period of famine is needed to \n\nstimulate the PHA storage capacity of cells (Reis et al 2003). Figure 4 represents a possible \n\nmetabolic pathway for acetate consumption under feast/famine conditions suggested by \n\nReis and co-workers (2003). \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4. Possible metabolic pathway for acetate consumption under feast/famine conditions  \n\n(Reis et al 2003) \n\n \n\nThe ratio between the length of the feast and famine phase (F/F ratio) is a crucial \n\nparameter affecting the performance of the selection stage (Albuquerque et al 2011). In \n\ngeneral, low F/F ratio ensures the selection of microorganisms that are most able to store \n\nPHA and their physiological adaptation toward PHA synthesis in the feast phase (Villano \n\net al 2014). \n\n2.5.2.1. Microbial community characterization \n\nDuring the process of selection of a PHA-accumulating culture, the microbial \n\ncommunity should be evaluated periodically in order to monitor its evolution, identify the \n\nbest producers and determine their relative abundance. The microbial characterization must \n\nbe correlated with the operational conditions allowing for the enhancement of those that \n\nfavour the selection of PHA-accumulating microorganisms (Serafim et al 2008a). \n\nMoreover, monitoring the culture evolution throughout the operational period allows to \n\nunderstand some changes in the performance of the MMC that could eventually occur \n\n(Queir\u00f3s et al 2014). \n\nPHA production by mixed cultures: a way to valorize industrial waste \n\nUniversity of Aveiro | IRSA/CNR \n\n20 \n\n \n\n Finally and with regard to ADF, the most studied PHA storage process by MMCs, \n\nthe mechanism of accumulation was first proposed in 1996 by Majone et al. (1996). In this \n\nprocess, also known as feast and famine, the MMC, under aerobic conditions, submitted to \n\nalternated periods of external substrate availability (feast) and unavailability (famine) \n\nresults in unbalanced growth. As mentioned before, the absence of a carbon source during \n\na period of time causes a decrease in the amount of intracellular components fundamental \n\nfor the cell growth (RNA and enzymes). Following this period of famine, if the MMC is \n\nfed with an excess of carbon, as the amount of enzymes available is lower than that \n\nnecessary for a maximum growth rate, the storage of PHAs became the dominant \n\nphenomena (Majone et al. 1996). As stated in the previous section, VFAs are the mainly \n\ncarbon source used by MMC to synthesis PHAs. Under ADF conditions, Reis and co-\n\nworkers (2003) have proposed a possible metabolic pathway for acetate consumption, as \n\nillustrated by Figure 9. \n\n \n\nFigure 9: Possible metabolic pathway for acetate consumption under ADF conditions by MMC (Reis et al. 2003) \n\n \n\nAs reviewed by Serafim and co-workers (2008), the selection of MMCs under ADF \n\nconditions can be performed using real complex wastes such as fermented cane molasses, \n\nfermented palm oil mill effluents, industrial wastewaters, fermented paper mill wastewater, \n\ntomato cannery waste or fermented brewery wastewater. \n\nTo complement the selection of the PHA-storing populations, the evolution of \n\nmicrobial community must be evaluated in order to identify the best producers and \n\n\n\n 27 \n\nSeveral studies focused on the microbial community structure of MMCs in PHA-\n\nproducing processes have revealed the presence of a wide phylogenetic diversity, although \n\nThauera, Azoarcus and Paracoccus have often been associated as PHA producing \n\norganisms (Dionisi et al 2005a; Dionisi et al 2005c; Serafim et al 2006; Lemos et al 2008; \n\nMoita and Lemos 2012; Queir\u00f3s et al 2014; Dai et al 2015).  \n\nDionisi et al. (2005a) used Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and \n\n16S rRNA clone library to follow the evolution of a PHA-producing MMC. The main \n\nphylogenetic groups identified were: Betaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and \n\nGammaproteobacteria (Dionisi et al 2005a).  \n\nDionisi et al. (2005c) used DGGE and elaborated a 16S rRNA clone library to \n\nidentify PHA-accumulating organisms in an ADF reactor. The dominant group was \n\nBetaproteobacteria (Thauera, Alcaligenes, Comamonas, Achromobacter). \n\nGammaproteobacteria (Kluyvera, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter) and Alphaproteobacteria \n\n(Xantobacter, Curtobacterium) were also present. Thauera was the dominant genus and \n\nwas described for the first time as a PHA-producer (Dionisi et al 2005c). \n\nSerafim et al. (2006) used FISH and Nile Blue staining to characterize the \n\nmicrobial populations in two reactors operated under ADF conditions, one consuming \n\nacetate and the other propionate. Betaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria were found \n\nto be the main phylogenetic groups and Azoarcus was identified as the genus mostly \n\nresponsible for PHA-accumulation (Serafim et al 2006). \n\n Lemos et al. (2008) used the sorting/reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain \n\nreaction (RT-PCR) approach to reveal the main composition of the PHA-accumulating \n\nbiomass present in two systems fed with different substrates: acetate and propionate. Using \n\nFISH, the presence of microorganisms identified by RT-PCR was confirmed. FISH \n\nanalysis showed that bacteria belonging to the genera Amaricoccus, Thauera and Azoarcus \n\nwere always present in both reactors. However, clear differences in the abundance of these \n\ngenera were observed between the two reactors, which could be related with the kind of \n\ncarbon source utilized (Lemos et al 2008).   \n\nMoita and Lemos (2012) used FISH to identify PHA-accumulating organisms \n\nselected under ADF conditions. The majority of the identified organisms belonged to \n\nAlphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, or Gammaproteobacteria classes (Moita and \n\nLemos 2012). \n\n\n\n28 \n\nQueir\u00f3s et al. (2014) selected a PHA-accumulating culture from a MMC and \n\ncharacterized the selected culture using FISH. The bacterial community was mostly \n\nconstituted by Alphaproteobacteria, followed by Betaproteobacteria and \n\nGammaproteobacteria. Within Alphaproteobacteria, small amounts of Paracoccus and \n\nDefluvicoccus related to Tetrad Forming Organisms (TFO) were detected (Queir\u00f3s et al \n\n2014). \n\nDai et al. (2015) investigated the potential of using wood hydrolysates as substrate \n\nto produce P(3HB) using a MMC. 16S rRNA sequencing with Illumina system was used to \n\nanalyse the microbial community. Actinobacteria, Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria were \n\nfound to be the dominant groups in the bioreactors. Several PHB-storing microorganisms \n\nbelonged to Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria groups (Dai et al 2015). \n\nIn the present work, the microbial community composition is going to be identified \n\nand monitored through FISH analysis. Throughout the SBR operational period, several \n\nsamples were collected and fixed in paraformaldehyde 4% in order to be preserved until \n\nsubmitted to the molecular analyses. A 16S rDNA clone library was also prepared. \n\n2.5.2.2. Operational parameters \n\nThe production of PHA by MMCs subjected to a feast and famine selection \n\nstrategy is usually carried out in SBRs, operated in cycles of feeding, reaction, settling and \n\ndrawn (Dias et al 2006). SBRs are ideal reactors for the selection of robust populations \n\nwith high ability of PHA storage, because biomass grows under transient conditions. \n\nFurthermore, this reactor is easy to control and highly flexible, allowing the rapid change \n\nof the process conditions, for example the duration of feeding and cycle length (Reis et al \n\n2003). \n\nThe MMC response is influenced by different factors such as reactor operating \n\nconditions (sludge retention time (SRT), hydraulic retention time (HRT), pH, temperature, \n\ncycle length, organic loading rate (OLR), influent substrate concentration and nutrient \n\nconcentration) as well as the feedstock (Reis et al 2011). \n\nDuring the reactor operational time, several cycles were monitored in order to study \n\nthe culture evolution. In these cycles, parameters such as temperature, pH and dissolved \n\noxygen (DO) concentration were monitored. \n\nThe pH was measured in order to check its influence in PHA accumulation. Ideally, \n\nit should be between 8 \u2013 9, since its reduction to values between 6 \u2013 7 causes the decrease \n\n\n\n 29 \n\nof cellular PHA content (Dias et al 2006). Villano et al. (2010) also observed that the rates \n\nand yields of PHA storage decreased, as pH increased from 7.5 to 9.5 (Villano et al 2010). \n\nAccording to Third at al (2003), limiting oxygen concentrations allows to achieve \n\nhigher yields of PHA storage, since the higher the concentration of DO, the greater will be \n\nthe proportion of substrate which will be used for cell growth and, consequently, less \n\nsubstrate will be converted to PHA (Third et al 2002). \n\nThe accumulation of storage polymers is strongly dependent on temperature and at \n\nhigher temperatures (35\u00baC), less PHB production occurs. Nevertheless, this could be an \n\nadvantage because the use of low temperatures allows for a less costly process (Krishna \n\nand Van Loosdrecht 1999). Johnson at al. (2010) concluded that at higher temperatures \n\n(30\u00baC) PHB storage was the dominant process in the feast phase. At lower temperatures \n\n(15\u00baC) the feast phase was longer and growth occurred predominantly directly on acetate \n\nrather than on stored P(3HB). This culture had a low PHB storage capacity (Johnson et al \n\n2010).  \n\nOne of the objectives of the selection stage is to produce a PHA-storing culture \n\nwith the highest productivity possible, that is, the amount of biomass produced per unit of \n\nvolume of reactor and per unit of time. To achieve high biomass volumetric productivities, \n\nthe SBR needs to be operated at OLRs as high as possible, which corresponds to high \n\ninfluent substrate concentration and/or short HRT (Villano et al 2014). \n\nBeun et al. (2002) concluded that for SRTs higher than 2 days, the yield of P(3HB) \n\nfrom acetate under excess nutrients was constant and, thus, independent of the specific \n\ngrowth rate. At a SRT below 2 days, the P(3HB) storage yield and productivity decreased \n\nsharply with the decrease of the SRT (Beun et al 2002). \n\nDionisi et el. (2007) studied the effect of the cycle length on the enrichment and \n\nselection of mixed cultures in SBRs. In the perspective of PHA production from organic \n\nwastes, at fixed OLR (20 gCOD L-1 day-1) the length of the cycle played a relevant role in \n\ndetermining the length of the feast and famine phases. With low or high lengths of cycle, \n\nstorage rates and yields were very low and the dynamic response of the biomass to \n\nsubstrate excess was dominated by growth. The selection of microorganisms with storage \n\nor growth response is correlated with the ratio of the feast phase/length of the cycle: \n\nstorage response was observed only when the feast phase was not longer than 20% of the \n\nlength of the cycle (Dionisi et al 2007).  \n\n\n\n30 \n\nRegarding the F/F ratio, low F/F values ensure physiological adaptation of the \n\nmicroorganisms, favouring PHA storage in the feast phase. High F/F ratios that result from \n\neither higher OLR/influent substrate concentration or shorter cycles can cause a partial or \n\ncomplete loss of the physiological adaptation, which will cause the substrate uptake to be \n\ndriven predominantly toward growth (Albuquerque et al 2011).  \n\nValentino et al. (2014) studied the effect of feed frequency on PHA production, \n\nwhile maintaining the same OLR, HRT and feed concentration (8.5 g COD L-1 of VFAs). \n\nThe effect of feeding time was evaluated with a cycle length of 8 h and an increase in the \n\nstorage response was observed by increasing the rate at which the substrate was fed into \n\nthe reactor. By decreasing the cycle length from 8 h to 6 h and then to 2 h, changing the \n\nfeed frequency or changing the organic load given per cycle, the length of the feast phase \n\ndecreased from 26 to 20 and then to 19.7% of the overall cycle length, respectively, due to \n\nan increase in the substrate removal rate (Valentino et al 2014).  \n\n2.6. PHAs production from low-value feedstocks \n\nAs already mentioned, the substrate cost is one of the major contributors to the high \n\nprice of PHAs, since the feedstock is estimated to account for 40% of the total production \n\ncost (Salehizadeh and Van Loosdrecht 2004). Therefore, to lower the production costs is \n\nessential to select cheaper substrates that can be used for synthesizing PHA with high \n\nyields (Lemos et al 2006). \n\nPreliminary results of several investigations showed the possibility of using agro-\n\nindustrial waste streams instead of synthetic substrates for PHA production (Dionisi et al \n\n2005b; Albuquerque et al 2007; Coats et al 2007; Bengtsson et al 2008b; Albuquerque et al \n\n2010b; Albuquerque et al 2011; Jiang et al 2012). Nevertheless, the PHA storage capacity \n\nobtained from those researches was still significantly lower than those of microbial \n\nenrichments selected on synthetic feedstocks. Most of these studies reported PHA content \n\naround 55% of the dry weight (Dionisi et al 2005b; Bengtsson et al 2008b; Albuquerque et \n\nal 2011). The microbial enrichment obtained by Jiang et al. (2012) could accumulate a \n\nmaximum of 77% PHA of cell dry weight within 5 hours (Jiang et al 2012). \n\nThe use of MMCs as PHA-producers was increasingly investigated as a mean of \n\nreducing production costs together with the use of several surplus-based feedstocks, \n\nincluding: fermented molasses (Albuquerque et al 2007; Albuquerque et al 2010b; \n\nAlbuquerque et al 2011), fermented paper mill effluents (Bengtsson et al 2008b; Jiang et al \n\n\n\n 31 \n\n2012), fermented OMEs (Dionisi et al 2005b; Beccari et al 2009), glycerol (Dobroth et al \n\n2011; Moralejo-G\u00e1rate et al 2011), bio-oil (Moita and Lemos 2012), municipal \n\nwastewaters (Coats et al 2007) and Hardwood Sulphite Spent Liquor?  (HSSL) (Queir\u00f3s et \n\nal 2014). \n\nDionisi et al. (2005) examined the production of PHA from OMEs using a three-\n\nstep strategy. In the fermentation step, OMEs were anaerobically fermented to obtain \n\nVFAs. The PHA production stage was investigated through batch tests performed by using \n\na MMC enriched in a SBR fed with a mixture of organic acids. The PHA production \n\nspecific rate obtained was 420 mg COD g COD-1 h-1 (Dionisi et al 2005b).  \n\nAlbuquerque et al. (2007) used a three-stage process to produce PHAs from sugar \n\ncane molasses. The three-step process used, comprised continuous acidogenic fermentation \n\nof molasses, selection of a PHA-accumulating culture under feast and famine conditions \n\nand batch PHA accumulation using the selected culture and the fermented molasses. Two \n\ndifferent strategies were used: conducting culture selection with a synthetic substrate \n\n(acetate) and accumulation with fermented molasses or using the fermented molasses as \n\nfeedstock in both steps. The effect of organic acids distribution on polymer composition \n\nand yield was evaluated with the acetate selected culture and the storage yields varied from \n\n0.37 to 0.50 Cmmol HA/Cmmol VFA. Low ammonia concentration (0.1 Nmmol/l) in the \n\nfermented molasses stimulated PHA storage and the storage yield obtained was 0.62 \n\nCmmol PHA/Cmmol VFA (Albuquerque et al 2007). \n\nBengtsson et al. (2008b) investigated the production of PHA from a paper mill \n\nwastewater using a three-stage process consisting in acidogenic fermentation to convert \n\nwastewater organic matter to VFAs, an activated sludge system operated under \n\nfeast/famine conditions for enrichment in PHA-producing organisms and PHA \n\naccumulation in batch experiments. The maximum PHA content achieved was 48% of the \n\nsludge dry weigh (Bengtsson et al 2008b). \n\nCoats et al. (2007) investigated PHA production with a MMC through an activated \n\nsludge process using carbon present in municipal wastewaters. Their goal was to \n\ndemonstrate that commercial PHA production could be integrated into various \n\nconfigurations of municipal wastewater treatment schemes. A PHA accumulation of 53% \n\nPHA (w/w) was obtained. The obtained results suggested that the commercial production \n\nof PHA could feasibly be integrated into wastewater treatment systems (Coats et al 2007). \n\n\n\n32 \n\nBeccari and co-workers (2009) investigated the performance of a three-stage \n\nprocess for PHA production from OMEs. In the first anaerobic stage, OMEs were \n\nfermented to VFAs in a packed bed biofilm reactor. This VFA-rich effluent was fed to the \n\nsecond stage, operated in an aerobic SBR, to select a MMC able to store PHA. Finally, the \n\nstorage response of the selected consortia was exploited in the third aerobic stage, operated \n\nin batch conditions. The maximum value of PHA storage rate was 146 mgCOD gCOD-1 h-1 \n\n(Beccari et al 2009). \n\nAlbuquerque et al. (2010a) used a 2-stage continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) \n\nsystem to carry out culture enrichment in a 3-stage process using sugar molasses as \n\nfeedstock in order to determine the impact of the reactor operation mode on PHA-\n\naccumulating culture selection under feast and famine conditions. The effect of different \n\noperating parameters such as influent substrate concentration (60\u2013120 Cmmol VFA/L) and \n\nratio between the HRT of the two CSTRs (0.2\u20130.5 h/h) on the selection efficiency were \n\nassessed. The culture reached a maximum PHA content of 61% (Albuquerque et al 2010a). \n\nMoralejo-G\u00e1rate and co-workers (2011) studied the production of PHA by a MMC \n\nusing glycerol as substrate. The PHA-producing MMC was enriched using feast/famine \n\nregime in a glycerol-fed SBR. In a subsequent fed-batch PHA production step, the \n\nenriched mixed community produced PHA up to a dry weight content of 80 wt% \n\n(Moralejo-G\u00e1rate et al 2011). \n\nAlbuquerque et al. (2011) studied the possibility to control polymer composition \n\nand properties in mixed culture PHA production from fermented molasses. The effects of \n\nsubstrate VFA composition and feeding regime on polymer composition and structure \n\nwere assessed. Continuous feeding strategy could be used to increase the HV content by 8\u2013\n\n9% relatively to that obtained from the same feedstock using pulse feeding. Therefore, the \n\nfeeding strategy could be used to manipulate polymer composition and properties. P(3HB-\n\nco-3HV) copolymers with HV fraction ranging from 15 to 39% were obtained, which \n\nsubsequently resulted in different polymer properties. It was found that the use of a \n\ncontinuous feeding strategy rather than a pulse feeding strategy can allow higher rates of \n\nsubstrate uptake and polymer storage, originating a considerable increase of volumetric \n\nproductivity. Different substrates were tested in order to study the effect of substrate VFA \n\nprofile on polymer composition, yield and maximum PHA accumulation. Simulated \n\nfermented molasses with different VFA profiles and real fermented molasses were tested. \n\n\n\n 33 \n\nIn terms of PHA storage efficiency, maximum PHA contents of 56 and 66% were \n\nobtained, with fermented molasses feed and simulated feedstock, respectively. The lower \n\nmaximum PHA content relates to the slightly lower rates of substrate uptake and PHA \n\nstorage observed with the real feedstock. In all the cases, P(3HB-co-3HV) copolymers \n\nwere produced and the polymer composition was not significantly affected by using real \n\nfermented molasses instead of the simulated fermented molasses. This indicates that the \n\nmolasses matrix does not introduce significant variation on the polymer composition \n\n(Albuquerque et al 2011).  \n\nDobroth et al. (2011) investigated the potential of PHA production on crude \n\nglycerol using MMC and determined that the enriched MMC produced exclusively P(3HB) \n\nutilizing the methanol present in crude glycerol. The maximum PHA content achieved was \n\n67% of cell dry weight (Dobroth et al 2011). \n\nJiang et al. (2012) used a three-step process to increase the maximum content that \n\ncan be stored by a MMC using paper mill effluent as feedstock. In this work, the paper mill \n\nwaste stream was firstly acidified to VFAs in a batch experiment. Then, the effluent from \n\nthe acidogenic reactors was used as substrate for the selection SBR, and for the \n\naccumulation reactor operated in a fed-batch mode. The selected culture could accumulate \n\nmaximum up to 77% PHA of cell dry weight within 5 hours (Jiang et al 2012). \n\nMoita and Lemos (2012) used bio-oil resulting from the fast-pyrolysis of chicken \n\nbeds as substrate to select a MMC able to produce PHA under feast/famine conditions. In \n\nthis study a maximum PHA content of 9.2% (g/g cell dry weight) was achieved in a SBR \n\noperated for culture selection (Moita and Lemos 2012). \n\nHSSL was firstly used as substrate for PHA production by MMCs by Queir\u00f3s et al. \n\n(2014). The MMC selection process was performed in a SBR operated under ADF \n\nconditions and the selected PHA-accumulating culture reached a maximum PHA content \n\nof 67.6% (Queir\u00f3s et al 2014). \n\nThese results demonstrate the high potential of MMCs in the industrial PHA \n\nproduction and lead us to believe that technological advances will allow the achievement \n\nof better productivities and lower production costs. \n\n2.7. HSSL \n\nSeveral advances in genetics, biotechnology and engineering are leading to a new \n\nmanufacturing concept for converting renewable biomass to valuable fuels and products, \n\n\n\n34 \n\ngenerally referred to as a biorefinery. The American National Renewable Energy \n\nLaboratory (NREL) defined a biorefinery as \u201ca facility that integrates biomass conversion \n\nprocesses and equipment to produce fuels, power, and chemicals from biomass. The \n\nbiorefinery concept is analogous to today\u2019s petroleum refineries, which produce multiple \n\nfuels and products from petroleum\u201d (NREL 2009). Biorefineries can produce various \n\nintermediates and final products, fuel or energy from cheap substrates such as industries \n\nwastes from food, agricultural, forestry or paper sectors (Kamm et al 2007). The use of \n\nthese wastes as substrates can simultaneously allow the reduction of disposal costs of these \n\nwastes and the production of high value products (Castilho et al 2009). The lignocellulosic \n\nbiorefinery uses second-generation technologies to promote the valorisation of wastes from \n\nagriculture or forests and presents high potential due to the abundance and accessibility of \n\nthe lignocellulosic biomass (Galbe and Zacchi 2007; Kamm et al 2007). \n\nTrees can be classified as hard- or softwood. Although the fibers in both types of \n\ntrees are constituted by the same components (mainly cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin), \n\ntheir proportions and structural characteristics are different (Pereira et al 2013) The \n\nsubstrate used in this work is the HSSL, a by-product of the paper industry. HSSL is a side \n\nproduct from acidic sulphite wood pulping which is usually burned to produce energy. The \n\nannual production of bleached sulphite eucalypt pulp is about 1 million tons per year \n\ncontributing to the economic profits of South Africa, Portugal, and Spain (Marques et al \n\n2009). \n\nIn the papermaking process, during grinding of wood, lignin is separated of the \n\nremaining fibrous material that is used to produce paper (Pereira et al 2013). This happens \n\nduring the acid sulphite cooking, where lignin is removed from the remaining wood in the \n\nform of lignosulphonates (LS). Eucalyptus globulus\u2019 HSSL main carbon compounds are \n\nLS and phenolic derivatives (60 \u2013 80 g/L), sugars (35 \u2013 45 g/L) from hydrolysed \n\nhemicelluloses, mainly xylose, and acetic acid (8 \u2013 9 g/L) (Marques et al 2009). The \n\nchemical composition of HSSL is listed in Table 4. \n\n  \n\n\n\n 35 \n\nTable 4. Chemical composition of HSSL (Xavier et al 2009) \n\n \n\nHSSL presents monomeric sugars in high amounts, so it could be considered an ideal \n\ncandidate for bioprocessing. However, it presents high levels of acetic acid, furfural and \n\nlow molecular weight LS which inhibit microbial metabolism, affecting the bioprocessing \n\nof HSSL (Xavier et al 2009).

Acidogenic fermentation \n\nThe MMC used to inoculate the AFR was collected from the anaerobic digester of \n\nthe WWTP Aveiro South (SIMRIA 2014). A pre-treatment was performed by heating the \n\ninoculum to 82\u00baC for 20 minutes in order to promote the enrichment of the MMC in \n\nacidogenic population over the methanogenic bacteria. \n\n3.2.  Bioreactors  \n\n3.2.1. AFR \n\nThe acidification of HSSL under anaerobic conditions was performed in a CSTR \n\nwith a working volume 1.55 L and a flow rate of the feeding solution of 0.97 L/d (imposed \n\nby an IsmatecTM Compact Digital Multichannel Pump) resulting in a HRT of 1.6 days. \n\nThe reactor had no system for retaining the biomass; therefore the SRT was the same as \n\nthe HRT. The effluent was collected at the outlet of the reactor by overflow. Reactor \n\nstirring was performed by a magnetic stirrer and kept constant at 100 rpm. Nitrogen was \n\nbubbled occasionally to assure anaerobic conditions. Oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) \n\nwas monitored with a transmitter M300 2-channel, ORP meter (Mettler-Toledo Thornton, \n\nInc). The system worked with temperature control at 30.0 \u00b1 1.0\u00baC using an external \n\nserpentine with meter. \n\n3.2.2. SBR \n\nIn this work, a SBR was operated for 70 days in order to select a stable culture \n\ncapable of storing PHA. The working volume was 1.5 L and the reactor was operated in \n\ncycles of ADF. Initially, the cycle duration was 24 hours comprising 22.5 hours of \n\naerobiosis, 1 hour of settling (with agitation and aeration switched off) and 0.5 hours \n\nwithdrawing of half of the volume of the supernatant (using a Watson-Marlow 101/R \n\n\n\n38 \n\npump), which was replaced by 750 mL of fresh medium during the first 15 minutes of each \n\ncycle (with a Watson-Marlow SCI 400 pump). These conditions resulted in a HRT of 2 \n\ndays. At the end of each cycle, before settling, 150 mL of mixed liquor were removed in \n\norder to establish a SRT of 10 days. Thereafter, the cycle\u2019s duration was changed to 12 \n\nhours, with 10.5 hours of aerobiosis, 1 hour of settling, 0.5 hours of withdrawing and 15 \n\nminutes of replacement with fresh medium. With this, the HRT and SRT were kept at 1 \n\nand 5 days, respectively. Several timers were used to control the reactor stirring (300 rpm), \n\naeration, feeding and withdrawing. The system was operated without control of pH, \n\ntemperature and oxygen. Air was supplied through a Boyu Air Pump, 8 L/min. pH values \n\nwere monitored using a pH meter pH Crison 28-P and the oxygen and temperature values \n\nwere monitored with Oxygen meter M300 Transmitter meter (Thornton Mettler-Toledo, \n\nInc). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.

Acidogenic fermentation medium \n\n3.3.1.1. HSSL pre-treatment \n\nHSSL from magnesium based acidic sulphite pulping of Eucalyptus globulus was \n\nsupplied by Caima \u2013 Ind\u00fastria de Celulose S.A. (Const\u00e2ncia, Portugal). The HSSL \n\n\n\n 39 \n\ncollected from the factory was subjected to a chemical pre-treatment in order to remove \n\nsome toxic compounds, such as phenolics, furfural and some LS. The pre-treatment of \n\nHSSL consisted in pH adjustment to 7.0 with KOH, followed by aeration with compressed \n\nair (6 h/L) to oxidize and precipitate some phenolic compounds. Then, the HSSL was \n\ncentrifuged for 1 hour at 5000 rpm and the precipitated colloids were filtered off using a 1 \n\n?m pore size glass microfiber filter. The pre-treated HSSL was stored at 4\u00baC.  \n\n3.3.1.2. Acidogenic fermentation medium \n\nThe medium used on the acidogenic CSTR was composed of (per litre of distilled \n\nwater): 80 mg CaSO4\u00b72H2O, 160 mg FeSO4\u00b77H2O, 80 mg K2HPO4, 160 mg KH2PO4, 160 \n\nmg MgSO4\u00b77H2O, 80 mg Na2MoO4\u00b72H2O and 160 mg NH4Cl. Phosphate salts were \n\nprepared apart, in order to avoid the irreversible precipitation with magnesium salts during \n\nsterilization. The pH of the feeding, before sterilization, was kept above 6.50. The flasks \n\nwith medium and phosphates were sterilized in autoclave and phosphates were further \n\nadded to the alimentation flask in a laminar flow hood. The COD of the feeding was 16 \n\ngCOD/L, which corresponded to an OLR of 10.3 gCOD/L.d.  \n\n3.3.2. Culture selection and PHA accumulation medium \n\nThe medium for culture selection and PHA accumulation steps was prepared using \n\nthe treated effluent of the acidification reactor supplemented with nutrients. The pre-\n\ntreatment of acidogenic fermentation reactor effluent consisted in effluent centrifugation \n\nfor 1 h at 5000 rpm followed by filtration of precipitated colloids using a 1 ?m glass \n\nmicrofiber filter (Ahlstrom, grade 131). Finally, the effluent was sterilized in autoclave.  \n\nThe medium was composed of (per litre of distilled water): 0.080 g CaSO4\u00b72H2O, \n\n0.020 g FeCl3, 0.064 g K2HPO4, 0.016 g KH2PO4, 0.160 g MgSO4\u00b77H2O, 0.4 g CH4N2S, \n\n0.008 g Na2MoO4\u00b72H2O and 0.160 g NH4Cl. Phosphate salts were prepared apart, in order \n\nto avoid the irreversible precipitation with magnesium salts during sterilization. To inhibit \n\nnitrification, 0.4 g/L of thiourea were added. The flasks with the medium and phosphates \n\nwere sterilized in autoclave. The pH of the feeding, before sterilization, was kept above \n\n6.50 and the phosphates were further added to the alimentation flask in a laminar flow \n\nhood. The COD in the feeding was 2 gCOD/L, which corresponded to an OLR of 1 and 2 \n\ngCOD/L.d, in the 24h cycle and 12h cycles, respectively. The average total VFAs content \n\n\n\n40 \n\nof the feeding was 1.0 gVFAs/L. \n\n3.4.  Sampling \n\nDuring the motorization of SBR cycles, samples were collected before the feeding \n\nperiod (t = 0), after the feeding stopped (t = 0.25 h) and with 30 minutes periods during the \n\nfirst 2 hours of the cycle. After this, samples were collected every hour during the first 8 \n\nhours of the cycle. Samples for determination of total suspended solids (TSS) and volatile \n\nsuspended solids (VSS) were collected after the feeding and at the 4th and 8th hour of the \n\ncycle motorization period. When each sample was collected, pH, temperature and DO \n\npercentage of the reactor were registered. After sample collection, pH was measured again \n\n(Consort C833). Each sample was centrifuged at 13 000 rpm during 10 minutes \n\n(Centrifuge MiniSpin, Eppendorf), and the supernatant was separated from the pellet. The \n\npellet and supernatant were stored in the freezer at -16\u00baC. The supernatant was used to \n\ndetermine the consumption of acids (acetic, propionic and butyric acids) and sugars \n\n(xylose and glucose), chemical oxygen demand (COD), lignosulphonates and ammonia. \n\nThe lyophilized pellet was used to determine the PHA concentration by Gas \n\nChromatography (GC). \n\n3.5. Accumulation tests \n\nAccumulation tests were performed with several pulses of feeding with the same \n\ncomposition used in the SBR but with some differences. The first test was performed with \n\nall the nutrients, the second one without phosphorus and the third one without ammonium.  \n\nThe kinetic tests with all the nutrients and without ammonia were performed in a \n\nbioreactor (BIOSTAT\u00ae) operated in fed-batch mode, Figure 6. A respirometer was coupled \n\nto the bioreactor by silicon tubing and the recirculation of the medium was performed by a \n\npump (Watson-Marlow SCI 400 pump). The stirring in the reactor was kept constant at \n\n250 rpm, and the supply of air was performed by an air pump (Boyu Air Pump, 8 L/min). \n\nThe bioreactor was operated without temperature control and sterile conditions. 1 L of \n\ninoculum withdrawn from the SBR was used. Five pulses of feeding (each with 500 mL) \n\nwere supplied, so the final working volume was of 3.5 L. Samples were collected every 15 \n\nminutes and the DO percentage was recorded at each 5 seconds for 3 minutes. \n\n \n\n\n\n 41 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 6. Bioreactor used in kinetic test \n\n \n\nThe kinetic test performed without phosphorus was carried out in a bioreactor with \n\na working volume of 0.5 L without temperature control and sterile conditions, Figure 7. \n\nThe respirometer was coupled to the bioreactor by silicon tubing and the recirculation of \n\nthe medium was performed by a peristaltic pump (Gilson Miniplus 3). The stirring in the \n\nreactor and respirometer were kept constant, 300 rpm, and the supply of air was performed \n\nby an air pump (Boyu Air Pump, 8 L/min). 250 mL of inoculum withdrawn from the SBR \n\nwere used. Three pulses with 250 mL of feeding without phosphorus were used. Samples \n\nwere collected every 15 minutes and the DO percentage was recorded at each 5 seconds for \n\n3 minutes.  \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7. Reactor, respirometer, oxygen meter and peristaltic pump used in kinetic test \n\n \n\n3.6. Analytical Methods \n\n3.6.1. Carbon sources analysis \n\nThe consumption of VFAs (acetic, propionic and butyric) and sugars (glucose and \n\nxylose) was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). \n\nFirst, samples were filtered using a membrane of 0.22 \u00b5m (Corning Costar Spin-X) \n\nat 8000 rpm (Centrifuge MiniSpin, Eppendorf) for 15 minutes. pH of samples was \n\ncorrected to values in the range of 1 \u2013 3, by adding H2SO4 0.25 M. HPLC analyses were \n\ncarried out using an ion exchange column (Aminex HPX-87H) with dimensions of \n\n300\u00d77.5 mm, connected to a pump (HITACHI L-2130 pump), a refractive index detector \n\n(Hitachi RI Detector L-2490) and an auto-sampler (Auto-sampler HITACHI L-2200). The \n\ncolumn temperature was 40\u00baC (external oven ParaLab). The eluent was H2SO4 0.01 N at a \n\nflow rate of 0.6 mL/min and it was prepared with milli-Q water and filtered with a \n\ncellulose acetate membrane, 0.2 ?m pore size (Whatman).  \n\nThe injected volume was 20 ?L. A calibration using standard curves for glucose, \n\nxylose, acetic, propionic and butyric acids was applied, in a concentration range of 0 to 2.0 \n\ng/L for glucose, acetic and propionic acids, 0.25 to 5.0 g/L for butyric acid and 0 to 10.0 \n\ng/L for xylose. \n\n\n\n 43 \n\n3.6.2. TSS and VSS determination \n\nCell dry weight was determined as VSS according to Standard Methods (APHA, \n\n1995). 5 mL of sample was filtered by vacuum filtration using filters (Cellulose Acetate \n\nFilter with pores 1 ?m, Sartorius) previously weighed. Subsequently, the membranes were \n\nplaced in an oven at 105\u00b0C for 24 hours. After cooling, the membranes were weighed and \n\nthe biomass was determined in g/L of TSS. Afterwards, the membranes were placed in an \n\noven at 550\u00b0C for 2 hours. After cooling the membranes, they were weighed and the \n\nconcentration of biomass was determined in g/L of VSS. \n\n3.6.3. Ammonia quantification \n\nAmmonia concentrations were determined using a Thermo Scientific Ion Selective \n\nElectrode. In order to adjust the ionic strength, to 1 mL of each sample, 100 ?L of 1M \n\nMgSO4 solution were added. A calibration curve was prepared using ammonia standards \n\nwith a range of concentrations between 1.00 \u00d7 10?1  and 6.25 \u00d7 10?4  M. The \n\nconcentration values of each sample were measured in mV, registered after 5 minutes of \n\nmeasurement.  \n\n3.6.4. LS quantification  \n\nLS quantification was performed according to Restolho et al. (2009), by measuring \n\nthe absorbance of the conveniently diluted samples at 273 nm, using a UV \n\nspectrophotometer (Shimadzu UVmini-1240) (Restolho et al 2009). The LS concentration \n\nwas determined using the Beer-Lambert law, with ? = 7.41 g-1cm-1 (Xavier et al 2009). \n\n3.6.5. COD \n\nCOD was measured with the spectrophotometer from the Merck kit according with \n\nthe Standard Methods APHA 5220 D (APHA, 1995) using a digestion solution with \n\nK2Cr2O7, HgSO4, H2SO4 and H2O and an acidic solution with H2SO4 and AgSO4. Each \n\ntube was prepared by adding 1.2 mL of digestion solution and 2.8 mL of acidic solution. \n\nThen, 2.0 mL of diluted sample were added. A blank was prepared by adding to the test \n\ntube 2.0 mL of distilled water instead of sample. Then, the tubes were shaken and placed in \n\na block digester Spectroquant TR620 (Merck Millipore) pre-heated to 150\u00baC for 2 h. After \n\ncooling down to room temperature, the optical path of the test tubes was carefully cleaned \n\nand the absorbance at 600 nm of each sample and blank was measured in a colorimeter \n\n\n\n44 \n\nSpectroquant Picco COD/CSB (Merck Millipore). A calibration curve was prepared with \n\nstandards of glucose and potassium hydrogen phthalate. \n\n3.6.6. PHA \n\nPHA concentrations were determined by GC using the method adapted from Lemos \n\net al. (2006). Lyophilized biomass was incubated for 3.5 h at 100\u00baC with 1:1 solutions of \n\nchloroform with heptadecane as internal standard, and a 20% acidic methanol solution. \n\nAfter the digestion step, the organic phase of each sample was extracted and injected into a \n\ngas chromatograph coupled to a Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID, Konik Instruments \n\nHRGC-3000C). A ZBWax-Plus column was used with hydrogen as the carrier gas (50 \n\nkPa). Split injection at 280\u00baC with a split ratio of 1:6 was used. The oven temperature \n\nprogram was as follows: 60\u00baC; then 20\u00baC/min until 100\u00baC; then 3\u00baC/min until 175\u00baC; and \n\nfinally 20\u00baC/min until 220\u00baC. The detector temperature was set at 250\u00baC. HB and HV \n\nconcentrations were calculated using standards of a commercial P(3HB-co-3HV) \n\n(88%/12%, Aldrich) and corrected using a heptadecane internal standard.?  \n\n3.7. Microbial community analysis \n\n3.7.1.  Biomass fixation \n\nSamples were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 8000 rpm and the pellet was \n\nresuspended in 1\u00d7PBS. This step was repeated 3 times. Paraformaldehyde was added to the \n\nresuspended biomass, in a proportion of 3 parts of paraformaldehyde to 1 part of biomass. \n\nThe mixture was incubated for 3 to 12 hours at 4\u00baC. The fixed sample was centrifuged (5 \n\nmin, 8000 rpm, 4\u00baC) and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was resuspended in \n\n1\u00d7PBS and this step was repeated 3 times to remove residues of paraformaldehyde. The \n\nbiomass was resuspended in 1 volume of ice-cold 1\u00d7PBS and 1 volume of ice-cold 96% \n\n(v/v) ethanol. Samples were stored at \u2013 20\u00baC (Amann et al 1995). \n\n3.7.2. Gram Staining \n\nAfter sample fixation, followed by air drying, the microscope slide was stained for \n\n1 minute with crystal violet solution and then the solution was removed with distilled \n\nwater. After, the slide was treated with lugol solution for 1 minute, washed with distilled \n\nwater, decolorized with acetone and then dried. Samples were covered with safranin \n\nsolution for 1 minute and washed with distilled water. The slide was left to air dry and was \n\n\n\n 45 \n\nthen observed under oil immersion at 1000\u00d7 magnification with direct illumination using a \n\nZeis Axioskop equipped with JVC TK-128OE Color Video Camera (VLC software), \n\nFigure 8. \n\n3.7.3.

FISH analysis \n\n5 ?L of biomass fixed on paraformaldehyde (4 % v/v) were placed in individual \n\nwells of a teflon coated slide and then left to air dry. Next, the slide was dehydrated in \n\nethanol series of 50%, 80% and 98% for 3 min each. Meanwhile, the hybridization and \n\nwashing buffers were prepared according to stringency of the probe(s) used. 10 ?L of \n\nhybridization buffer and 0.5 ?L of each probe (50 ng/?L) were added to each well. Next, \n\nthe slide was placed inside the hybridization chamber and the remaining hybridization \n\nbuffer was used to moisten a tissue paper placed inside this chamber.

Extraction, Purification and Amplification of genomic DNA \n\nDNA was extracted from a SBR sample collected during the apparent stationary \n\nphase of operation (on 66th day). DNA extraction was performed using PowerSoil\u00ae DNA \n\nIsolation kit following the protocol described by the manufacturer. \n\nThe primers used to amplify 16S rDNA were 27 forward (f) and 1492 reverse (r), \n\nTable 6. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was performed in the BioRad T100TM Thermal \n\nCycler. For the 27f and 1492r primers, a reaction volume of 25 ?L was used and the PCR \n\nreaction was composed by: 12.5 ?L of Lucigen Taq98TM Hot Start 2X master mix, 1.25 ?L \n\nof each primer, 1 ?L of DNA and 9 ?L of nuclease-free water. The following PCR cycles \n\nwere used: 98\u00baC for 2 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of 98\u00baC for 0.5 minutes, 58\u00baC for 0.5 \n\nminutes and 72\u00baC for 1 minute and, finally, an extension at 72\u00baC for 10 minutes. After the \n\nlast cycle, samples were cooled down to 4\u00baC and an agarose (1%) electrophoresis was \n\nperformed to check if there was amplification. Afterwards, the PCR products were purified \n\nusing the QIAquick\u00ae PCR purification kit of (Quiagen, Milan, Italy) and quantified using \n\nthe NanoDrop2000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific, Milan, Italy).  \n\n3.7.8. 16S rDNA Clone Library \n\nAfter purification and quantification, the amplified 16S rDNA was ligated into \n\npGEM\u00ae-T vector (Promega, USA) and transformed into JM109 Competent Cells \n\n(Promega, USA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The transformed cells were \n\nplated in LB/ampicillin/IPTG/X-Gal plates and incubated overnight at 37\u00baC. Clones were \n\nscreened for insertion of the correct size by PCR amplification using primers T7f and \n\nM13r. A denaturation step was performed before PCR amplification. This step consisted in \n\na cycle of 96\u00baC for 10 minutes. For the T7f and M13r primers, a reaction volume of 100 \n\n?L was used and the PCR reaction was composed by: 50 ?L of Lucigen Taq98TM Hot Start \n\n2X master mix, 5 ?L of each primer, 40 ?L of nuclease-free water and DNA from colony. \n\nPCR amplification was performed as already described, using the following cycles: 98\u00baC \n\nfor 2 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of 98\u00baC for 0.5 minutes, 57\u00baC for 1 minute and 72\u00baC \n\nfor 2 minutes and an extension of step of 72\u00baC for 20 minutes. \n\nDNA sequencing was performed by BioFab (Rome, Italy) using the primers 530f, \n\n926f and 907r, Table 6. In a first approach, all clones were partially sequenced, using 530f \n\nprimer. After this, taking into consideration the obtained results, some clones were \n\n\n\n50 \n\ncompletely sequenced, using 926f and 907r primers. After receiving the results, the \n\nsequences were manually assembled and the organisms\u2019 identities were deduced through \n\nbasic local alignment search tool (BLAST). The complete sequences obtained were \n\ndeposited in GenBank (accession numbers: KT262954, KT262955, KT262951, \n\nKT262956, KT262952, KT262957, KT262958, KT262959, KT262960, KT262961, \n\nKT262962, KT262953, KT262963, KT262964, KT2629). \n\n \n\nTable 6.

Calculation of Kinetic and Stoichiometric Parameters \n\nThe sludge PHA content was calculated as a percentage of TSS on a mass basis:  \n\n%PHA =  \nPHA\n\nTSS\n\u00d7 100 (gPHA gTSS)?  \n\nwhere TSS includes active biomass (X) and PHA. Active biomass was calculated by \n\nsubtracting PHA from VSS. The maximum specific substrate uptake (-qS in \n\nCmmolS/CmmolX.h) was determined by adjusting a linear function to the experimental \n\ndata of substrate concentrations plotted over time, calculating the first derivative at time \n\nzero (taking the slope of the fitting) and dividing the value obtained by the active biomass \n\nconcentration at that point. The volumetric substrate uptakes (-rS in CmmolS/L.h) were \n\ndetermined by adjusting a linear function to the experimental data of substrate (VFAs) \n\nplotted over time, calculating the first derivative at time zero (taking the slope of the \n\nfitting). The amount of stored PHA (?%PHA) was calculated as the difference between the \n\nPHA percentage at the end of the feast phase (i.e. the substrate depletion time) and at the \n\nbeginning of the respective cycle. The yields of PHA (YPHA/S in CmmolPHA/CmmolS) and \n\nactive biomass (YX/S in CmmolX/CmmolS) on substrate consumed were calculated by \n\ndividing the amount of PHA formed or the active biomass formed by the total amount of \n\nsubstrate consumed, respectively. The respiration yield on substrate (YO2/S in gO2/gS) was \n\ncalculated by dividing the decreased amount of O2 consumed by respiration (in g/L) per \n\namount of substrate consumed (in gS/L). Since no nitrification occurred, because thiurea \n\nwas added to the feeding medium, and based on the premise that the molecular formula for \n\nbiomass is C5H7NO2, it was possible to establish that for the production 8 mg of active \n\nbiomass there is a need of 1 mg of N (Serafim et al 2004). This relation allowed for the \n\ncalculation of the specific growth rate of the active biomass. The specific growth rate was \n\ncalculated resorting to the following formula: \n\n? =  \n1\n\nX\n\u00d7\n\n??\n\n??\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n 53 \n\n5. Results and Discussion \n\n5.1. SBR performance \n\nThe SBR was operated along 70 days with the objective of selecting a stable PHA-\n\nproducing MMC. During the operational time of the SBR several parameters were \n\nmonitored such as: consumption of VFAs (acetic, propionic and butyric acids), sugars \n\n(xylose and glucose), COD, LS and ammonium and production of PHAs and biomass. The \n\nSBR was firstly operated with 24 h cycles and on day 44 the cycle duration was changed to \n\n12 h, in order to increase the number of cycles per SRT. \n\nIn this work, the process of culture selection was performed using a medium \n\nenriched with VFAs as substrate, since VFAs are direct substrates for PHA storage. The \n\nevolution of the uptake rates of acetic, propionic and butyric acids is shown in Figure 10. \n\nThe average acetic acid uptake rate (2.99 \u00b1 2.02 Cmmol/L.h) was higher that the average \n\nuptake rates of propionic acid (1.23 \u00b1 1.13 Cmmol/L.h) and butyric acid (2.19 \u00b1 1.65 \n\nCmmol/L.h), which demonstrates a preference of the culture for acetic acid. The propionic \n\nacid consumption was relatively constant throughout the SBR operational time and the \n\nbutyric acid uptake rate stabilized from day 37. Ammonium was consumed at 0.111 \u00b1 \n\n0.100 g/L.h. Between the 32nd and 52nd day, the ammonium uptake rates suffered an \n\nincrease, and the highest value was recorded on the 52nd day (0.339 g/L.h). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10.

The average variation of ?%PHA was 16.2 \u00b1 13.9%, with \n\nthe lowest value being registered at the 34th day (0.34%) and the highest value at the 10th \n\nday (48.8%). The values of ?%PHA and PHA concentration were unstable throughout the \n\nfirst 37th days of SBR operation and several peaks of production were detected. Between \n\nthe 46th and 66th day, although ?%PHA was lower than before, PHA production became \n\nmore stable and it varied in the range 9.1 \u00b1 2.4%. This leads to believe that the culture \n\nPHA storage was not affected by change of cycle duration. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 11. ?%PHA, Active Biomass and PHA concentrations throughout the SBR operational time \n\n \n\nFigure 12 shows the evolution of the produced monomers during the SBR \n\noperation. If mixtures of VFAs such as acetate, propionate, butyrate, and valerate are used \n\nas a substrate for PHA production, acetyl-CoA, and propionyl-CoA are formed as \n\nprecursors for PHA production, resulting in a copolymer containing HB and HV \n\nmonomers (Dias et al 2006; Albuquerque et al 2007). In this case, the produced PHA was a \n\ncopolymer P(3HB-co-3HV) with an average monomeric composition (on a molar basis) of \n\n69:31 \u00b1 7:7 (HB:HV). After the change of cycle duration on day 44, the co-polymer \n\ncomposition became more stable, having a average monomeric composition (on a molar \n\nbasis) of 77:23 \u00b1 1:1 (HB:HV). \n\n0.0\n\n10.0\n\n20.0\n\n30.0\n\n40.0\n\n50.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n3 5 10 23 26 30 32 34 37 46 62 66\n\n?\n %\n\nP\nH\n\nA\n\nA\nc\nti\n\nv\ne\n B\n\nio\nm\n\na\nss\n\n, \nP\n\nH\nA\n\n (\ng\n\n/L\n)\n\nt (day)\n\nActive Biomass PHA ? %PHA\n\n\n\n 55 \n\n \n\nFigure 12. Evolution of the content of HB and HV during the SBR operational time \n\n \n\nThe F/F ratio is an important parameter in the culture selection. In general, low F/F \n\nvalues ensure physiological adaptation of the microorganisms, favouring PHA storage \n\nduring the feast phase (Albuquerque et al 2011; Reis et al 2011). As shown in Figure 13, \n\naround day 34, the F/F ratio stabilized at 0.091, which is an indication of culture \n\nstabilization. On day 44, the cycle duration was changed and after some instability, the F/F \n\nratio stabilized again on the 55th day, this time at 0.2. This corresponded with the \n\nstabilization of VFAs uptake rates and with the stabilization of PHA production. \n\nAccording to Dionisi et al. (2007), the best storage response is observed when the feast \n\nphase is not longer than 20% of the length of the cycle, so the obtained F/F ratio is \n\nconsidered acceptable. Albuquerque et al. (2010b) also found a predominant storage \n\nresponse with a F/F ratio of 0.21, using fermented molasses as substrate.  \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n3 5 10 23 26 30 32 34 37 46 62 66\n\nf H\nB\n, \nf H\n\nV\n\nt (day)\n\nHB HV\n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\nFigure 13.

SBR cycles \n\nAlong the 70 days of SBR operation, several cycles were monitored in order to \n\nfollow the evolution of the culture selection process. During cycles several parameters \n\nwere followed, such as the pH, temperature, uptake of acetate, propionate, butyrate and \n\nammonium, oxygen consumption and PHA production.  \n\n \n\n5.1.1.1. 24 hour cycle period \n\nFigure 14 shows a representative cycle on day 37, with a F/F of 0.09 and 24 h of \n\ncycle length.

SBR cycle on the 37th day of operation \n\n \n\nIn the beginning of the cycle, fresh medium was supplied to the reactor (0 \u2013 0.25 \n\nh), marking the start of the feast phase. In this work, no pH control was imposed and \n\nbecause of that the pH suffered changes throughout the cycle. It is possible to see that the \n\npH decreased to 7.54 after the feeding (t=0.25 h) and after the first 2 hours, it increased \n\nuntil reaching 8.58. pH increased during the feast phase and then stabilized. Chua and co-\n\nworkers (2003) studied the effect of pH on PHA content using acetate as substrate. They \n\nfound that, when controlling the pH at 6 or 7, the PHA content was lower than at pH 8 or 9 \n\n(Chua et al 2003). Serafim et al. (2004) also found that the polymer yield per substrate and \n\nthe intracellular P(3HB) content were higher at pH 8 than at pH 7, and increased sharply \n\nwhen the pH was not controlled (it varied from 8 to 9.5). Oehmen and co-workers (2014) \n\nalso studied the effect of pH control in the volumetric productivity of PHA production by \n\nan MMC (Oehmen et al 2014). The operation of a SBR with pH control at 8 resulted in \n\nhigher volumetric productivity of PHA as compared to SBR operation without pH control \n\n(pH 8\u20139). The culture selected at pH 8 demonstrated a higher total volumetric productivity \n\nof PHA, since it was able to achieve a similar specific PHA production capacity while \n\nexhibiting a faster biomass growth rate. Change in pH was found to directly affect the \n\nmicrobial community composition and culture metabolism and Azoarcus was more \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n0.0\n\n2.0\n\n4.0\n\n6.0\n\n8.0\n\n10.0\n\n12.0\n\n14.0\n\n16.0\n\n18.0\n\n20.0\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\n%\n D\n\nO\n\np\nH\n\n, \nA\n\nm\nm\n\no\nn\n\niu\nm\n\n (\nm\n\nM\n),\n\n L\nS\n\n, \n\nC\nO\n\nD\n (\n\ng\n/L\n\n),\n A\n\nc\ne\nti\n\nc\n A\n\nc\nid\n\n, \nP\n\nr\no\n\np\nio\n\nn\nic\n\n A\nc\nid\n\n ,\n \n\nB\nu\n\nty\nr\nic\n\n A\nc\nid\n\n (\nC\n\nm\nm\n\no\nl/\n\nL\n),\n\n P\nH\n\nA\n (\n\nC\nm\n\nm\no\n\nl/\nL\n\n)\n\nTime (h)\n\npH Acetic Acid Propionic Acid\n\nButyric Acid COD LS\n\nAmmonium PHA Dissolved Oxygen\n\n\n\n58 \n\nselectively enriched at pH 8. While controlling pH may present an attractive strategy to \n\nincrease volumetric PHA productivity, it should be noted that this also implies an \n\nadditional cost associated with the use of chemicals for pH control in large-scale \n\napplications. Nevertheless, from the point of view of the operation simplicity, reactor \n\noperation without pH control reduces both process control complexity and operating costs.  \n\nThe concentrations of acetate, propionate, butyrate, ammonium and LS increased \n\nafter the feeding, as expected. It is possible to see that the depletion of acetic, propionic \n\nand butyric acids occurred after 2 hours. Acetic acid was consumed preferentially with an \n\nuptake rate of 6.44 Cmmol/L.h, followed by butyric and propionic acids, with uptake rates \n\nof 3.94 and 3.11 Cmmol/L.h, respectively. VFAs were used by bacteria for the formation \n\nof new biomass (indicated by ammonia and biomass measurements), but mostly for storage \n\nof substrate in form of PHA. During the first 2 hours of the cycle, COD and LS were \n\nconsumed at 0.584 and 0.023 g/L.h, respectively. During the feast phase, ammonium was \n\nconsumed at rate of 0.179 g/L.h. \n\nIn general, the moment of carbon source exhaustion (end of feast phase and \n\nbeginning the famine phase) is accompanied by a sudden increase of DO concentration and \n\nby oxygen uptake rate (OUR) decrease (Serafim et al 2004). In this case an increase in DO \n\nvalues was verified at the 2nd hour, which coincided with the depletion of acetic, propionic \n\nand butyric acids. For this reason, when the acids are exhausted, cells began to consume \n\nother available carbon sources that are more difficult to assimilate. If there are no other \n\navailable substrates, when the famine phase begins, only cells that have accumulated PHA \n\nin the feast phase will survive, selecting the best PHA-accumulating microorganisms. \n\nAfter depletion of VFAs, the concentration of CQO and LS continued to decrease, \n\nwhich indicates that other forms of carbon continued to be consumed by the culture. \n\nHowever, the feast and famine phases are only applicable to organisms that consume \n\nVFAs, and are not true feast and famine phases for organisms that consume other carbon \n\nsources present, like xylose, glucose and LS. In this cycle, it is possible to define that the \n\nfeast phase occurred between the 0.25 and 2 hours and that the famine phase occurred \n\nbetween the 3rd and 24th hours. Therefore, this cycle had a F/F ratio of 0.09.  \n\nSince VFAs are the preferential substrates for PHA accumulation, it makes sense \n\nthat the maximum PHA value (17.5 Cmmol/L) was registered at the end of the feast phase, \n\nwhen the depletion of VFAs occurred. For this cycle, the ?%PHA was 6.3%. After 1.5 \n\n\n\n 59 \n\nhours, the concentration of PHA began to decrease since during the famine phase the \n\nculture consumed stored PHA as carbon source to ensure cell growth and maintenance. \n\nAlthough ammonium was consumed at a lower rate during the famine phase (0.041 g/L.h), \n\nthe presence of ammonium throughout the full feast and famine cycle allowed PHA-\n\naccumulating organisms to use the intracellularly stored polymer for growth. The yield \n\nYPHA/S was 0.61 Cmmol PHA/Cmmol S, where S is the sum of VFAs concentrations. \n\nBetween the 1.5th and 8th hour of the cycle, PHA concentration decreased 53%. \n\n \n\nFigure 15. HB and HV monomers molar fraction evolution throughout the cycle from day 37 \n\n \n\n Figure 15 shows the evolution of the produced monomers during the cycle from \n\nday 37. In this case, the produced PHA was P(3HB-co-3HV). During the first 2 hours of \n\nthe cycle, the HB molar fraction suffered an increased and from then on the copolymer \n\ncomposition became stable. At the 1.5th hour, the copolymer had a monomeric composition \n\n(on a molar basis) of 56:44 (HB:HV). \n\n5.1.1.2. 12 hour cycle period \n\nSeveral cycle lengths between 2 and 12 h were already tested for the selection of \n\nPHA-producing MMC (Reis et al 2011). In this work, the SBR was firstly operated in 24 h \n\ncycles and when a stabilization of the F/F values was observed, the cycle duration was \n\nchanged to 12 h, in order to increase the number of cycles per SRT.

The pH \n\ndecreased to 8.01 after the feeding (t=0.25 h) and then increased until reaching 8.78. \n\nThe concentrations of acetate, propionate, butyrate, ammonium and LS increased \n\nafter the feeding and then declined throughout the cycle. Acetic and butyric acids were \n\nconsumed preferentially with uptake rates of 3.51 and 3.36 Cmmol/L.h, respectively. \n\nPropionic acid was consumed at 0.802 Cmmol/L.h. The same tendencies of VFAs \n\nconsumption were observed in the 24 h cycle. During the first 2 hours of the cycle, COD \n\nwas consumed at 0.276 g/L.h. No tendency on LS consumption was observed, so a \n\nconsumption rate cannot be estimated. During the feast phase, ammonium was consumed \n\nat rate of 0.057 g/L.h. \n\nWhen the substrate was depleted, the famine phase started at the 2nd hour. In this \n\ncycle the feast phase occurred between the 0.25 and 2 hours and the famine phase occurred \n\nbetween the 3rd and 12th hours, originating a F/F ratio of 0.2.  \n\nThe maximum PHA concentration (31.8 Cmmol/L) was registered at the 2nd hour, \n\nwhich corresponded to the end of the feast phase. For this cycle, ?%PHA was 7.3%. After \n\nthe 2nd hour, the concentration of PHA began to decrease since the stored PHA was \n\nconsumed for growth and maintenance. The yield YPHA/S was 0.64 Cmmol PHA/Cmmol S. \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\n5.0\n\n6.0\n\n7.0\n\n8.0\n\n9.0\n\n10.0\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\n%\nD\n\nO\n, \n\nA\nm\n\nm\no\n\nn\niu\n\nm\n (\n\nm\nM\n\n),\n P\n\nH\nA\n\n (\nC\n\nm\nm\n\no\nl/\n\nL\n)\n\np\nH\n\n, \nA\n\nc\ne\nti\n\nc\n A\n\nc\nid\n\n, \nP\n\nr\no\n\np\nio\n\nn\nic\n\n A\nc\nid\n\n, \n\nB\nu\n\nty\nr\nic\n\n A\nc\nid\n\n (\nC\n\nm\nm\n\no\nl/\n\nL\n),\n\n C\nO\n\nD\n, \nL\n\nS\n (\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\nTime (h)\n\npH COD Acetic Acid\n\nPropionic Acid Butyric Acid LS\n\nDissolved Oxygen Ammonium PHA\n\n\n\n 61 \n\nThe PHA concentration decreased 33% between the 2nd and 8th hour of the cycle. \n\n \n\nFigure 17.

When comparing these results with the ones from 24 h cycle, is \n\npossible to see that polymer composition was more stable in 12 h cycle. In this cycle, an \n\nincrease in the HB content was observed which was not expected since the butyric acid \n\nproportions used in the feeding, were the same in both cycles. \n\n5.2. Accumulation tests \n\nAfter operating the SBR under feast and famine conditions for the enrichment in \n\nPHA-producing organisms, the storage response of the selected consortia was exploited in \n\nthe third stage, which consisted in several accumulation tests operated in batch conditions. \n\nThree SBR purges from the previous days were used as inoculum for the accumulation \n\ntests. Since the objective of these tests was to evaluate the PHA production of the selected \n\nculture, the MMC was submitted to consecutive feeding pulses of VFA-rich medium, with \n\nthe objective of maximizing PHA production. The effects of ammonium and phosphorus \n\nlimitation were also studied.  \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n0 0.25 0.5 1 1.5 2 3 5 6 7 8\n\nf H\nB\n, \nf H\n\nV\n\nTime (h)\n\nf HB f HV\n\n\n\n62 \n\n5.2.1. Accumulation test without limitations \n\nThe first kinetic test was performed with five pulses of feeding with the same \n\ncomposition used in the SBR without nutrient limitation, Figure 18. The kinetic and \n\nstoichiometric parameters are shown in Table 7. Five pulses of feeding were supplied to \n\nthe bioreactor. Each pulse was added when increases in DO was detected, since it is \n\nassociated with VFAs depletion. The addiction of a new pulse was associated with \n\nincreases in VFAs, COD and ammonium concentrations and decreases of pH and DO \n\nconcentration.  \n\nPropionic and butyric acids were consumed to exhaustion in every pulse, but the \n\ncontrary occurred with acetic acid. Butyric acid was preferably consumed, followed by \n\nacetic and propionic acids. In general, the moment of carbon source exhaustion is \n\naccompanied by a sudden increase of the DO concentration and by the OUR decrease \n\n(Serafim et al 2004). However, at the end of each of the five pulses, acetic acid was never \n\ndepleted. The end of the pulses was only associated with a clear increase in the DO and \n\nexhaustion of butyric and propionic acids, which were present in the feeding in lower \n\nconcentrations. \n\nThe maximum PHA content obtained in this assay was 47.1% of cell dry weight at \n\n3.75 h, which is more 68.7% than at the beginning of the experiment. The overall yield \n\nYPHA/S obtained in this accumulation test was 0.39 CmmolPHA/CmmolS. Although the \n\nacetic acid was not depleted in any of the pulses, the yield YPHA/S from the 2\nnd and 3rd \n\npulses was higher than one (1.63 and 1.05 CmmolPHA/CmmolS, respectively). This is due \n\nto the fact that other non-quantified components of the medium, such as LS and phenolics, \n\nwere probably converted to PHA. The produced copolymer had an average monomeric \n\ncomposition (on a molar basis) of 82:18 \u00b1 2:2 (HB:HV). The monomeric composition of \n\nthe copolymer was uniform throughout the test. \n\n \n\n\n\n 63 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n            \n\nFigure 18.

Accumulation test with phosphorus limitation \n\nUnder phosphorus limitation, phosphorus is supposed to be more transferable than \n\nammonium from one component of the cell to another, due to its reorganization in the \n\ncells. Moreover, under phosphorus limitation, ATP synthase activity decreases and the \n\nKrebs cycle is restrained, promoting the conversion of excess carbon into PHA. PHA \n\nproduction by axenic cultures appears to be higher under phosphorus limitation than under \n\nammonium limitation (Cavaill\u00e9 et al 2013). For this motives, phosphorus limitation was \n\ntested in an accumulation test. The results obtained are shown in Figure 19 and kinetic and \n\nstoichiometric parameters in Table 7. Three pulses of feeding without phosphorus were \n\nsupplied to the bioreactor. As in the previous assay, only the butyric and propionic acids \n\nwere consumed to exhaustion in all the pulses, while acetic acid was never exhausted. \n\nHowever, the increase in the DO that generally follows substrate depletion was detected at \n\nthe end of each pulse. Nevertheless, acetic acid was preferably consumed, followed by \n\nbutyric and propionic acids. \n\nGrowth rates in this kinetic test were lower than those obtained in the accumulation \n\ntest without limitations. This was expected since, under phosphorus limitation, less carbon \n\nis deviated to growth being used for PHA storage.  \n\nThe maximum PHA content obtained was 32.7% of cell dry weight at 4 h, which \n\nwas more 57.6% than at the beginning of the experiment. Although acetic acid was always \n\navailable, during all the pulses the same tendency was observed: first an increase of PHA \n\ncontent occurred, followed by its decrease. The overall yield YPHA/S obtained in this \n\naccumulation test was 0.34 CmmolPHA/CmmolS. The produced copolymer had an \n\naverage monomeric composition (on a molar basis) of 71:29 \u00b1 12:12 (HB:HV). \n\nCavaill\u00e9 et al. (2013) investigated P(3HB) production by waste activated sludge in \n\naerobic fed-batch conditions using acetic acid as substrate, under phosphorus limitation. A \n\nmaximum P(3HB) content of 67% (gP(3HB)/gVSS) and P(3HB) yields ranging from 0.21 \n\nto 0.31 Cmmol P(3HB)/Cmmol S were obtained. Although, the maximum PHA content \n\nobtained in this accumulation test was lower than the one obtained by Cavaill\u00e9 and co-\n\nworkers, the yield YPHA/S was higher. \n\n \n\n\n\n 66 \n\n                \n\n                \nFigure 19.

Accumulation test with ammonium limitation \n\nAmmonium limitation usually triggers PHA production by MMC mixed cultures. \n\nUnder ammonium limitation, protein synthesis decreases and the carbon flow is redirected \n\nto PHA synthesis. Ammonium limitation impacts the cell growth by reducing enzymatic \n\nactivity (Cavaill\u00e9 et al 2013). Based on these findings, the production of PHA under \n\nammonium limitation was also studied in this work. \n\nThe results obtained are shown in Figure 20 and the kinetic and stoichiometric \n\nparameters in Table 7. Five pulses of feeding were supplied to the bioreactor and each \n\npulse was added when an increase in DO was detected. Contrary to what was observed in \n\nthe previous accumulation tests, VFAs were consumed to exhaustion in all the pulses. \n\nSubstrate depletion was accompanied by an increase of DO and OUR decrease. Acetic acid \n\nwas preferably consumed, followed by butyric and propionic acids. Despite no ammonium \n\nwas added to the medium, the fact that the inoculum used was withdrawn from the SBR \n\ncould explain the presence of some ammonium in the medium during the accumulation \n\ntest. \n\nSince ammonium is essential for growth, it can be assumed that most of the carbon \n\nconsumed was redirected only to PHA production and cell maintenance. Because of this, \n\ngrowth rates were inferior than those obtained in the accumulation test without nutrient \n\nlimitation. The maximum PHA content obtained was 34.6% of cell dry weight at 5.25 h, \n\nwhich was more 82.7% than at the beginning of the experiment. The overall yield YPHA/S \n\nobtained in this accumulation test was 0.79 CmmolPHA/CmmolS. The produced \n\ncopolymer had an average monomeric composition (on a molar basis) of 76:24 \u00b1 1:1 \n\n(HB:HV), which coincided with the composition of the copolymer produced in the SBR at \n\nthe same time. The monomeric composition of the copolymer was uniform throughout the \n\ntest. \n\nThe PHA storage capacity in this accumulation test is much lower than others \n\ndescribed in the literature. For example, Johnson et al. (2009) operated an acetate-fed SBR \n\nin order to select a PHA-accumulating MMC and evaluated the PHA storage capacity of \n\nthe selected MMC in a fed-batch reactor under nitrogen limitation. The enriched mixed \n\nculture produced PHA up to a cellular content of 89 wt % within 7.6 h. Albuquerque et al. \n\n(2010b) also reached a maximum PHA content of 74.6% in a accumulation test, using as \n\nsubstrate a complex feedstock such as fermented sugar molasses.  \n\n\n\n 68 \n\n      \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n             \n\nFigure 20.

Microbial Community Characterization \n\n5.3.1. Morphological Analysis \n\nAs stated previously, the analysis of the evolution of the microbial community \n\nthroughout the reactor operation is crucial. The morphology of the selected MMC were \n\nanalysed using several biological staining methods such as Gram, Neisser and Nile blue. \n\nPhase contrast microscopy was also used to identify the main morphotypes present in the \n\nmicrobial community.  \n\nGram, Neisser and Nile blue staining techniques were performed to original sludge \n\nand samples collected from the SBR on days 17, 32, 45, 51, 60 and 66 of operation. The \n\nresults are summarized in Table 8. The MMC was dominated by Gram negative (Gram-) \n\ncells throughout the entire operational period, yet a slight increase of Gram positive \n\n(Gram+) cells was observed at the 55th day of SBR operation. The high Gram- bacteria \n\ncontent is positive since these bacteria usually show good growth and higher PHA \n\naccumulation capability (Valappil et al 2006). With Gram staining it is also possible to \n\ninfer about the cells\u2019 morphology. The dominant morphologies were cocci and bacilli, \n\nespecially forming in dense aggregates. Some streptobacilli and streptococci were also \n\ndetected. \n\nRegarding Neisser staining results, Neisser negative (Neisser-) cells were dominant \n\nin the beginning of the operational period and an increase of Neisser positive (Neisser+) \n\ncells was observed throughout the reactor operation. It is worth noting that some of the \n\nNeisser+ cells were totally stained instead of presenting dark spots on the edge of the cells, \n\nwhich are typical of the phosphorous accumulating organisms. \n\nNile Blue stain is a technique that can be used to confirm the presence of PHA-\n\naccumulating bacteria. Since the beginning of SBR operation, the presence of PHA \n\ninclusion bodies was easily noticeable by the existence of brilliant dots in the stained cells \n\nunder epifluorescence. \n\n \n\n\n\n 70 \n\nTable 8.

EPS Staining results  \n\nBecause of the high tendency of the biomass to generate dense and indestructible \n\naggregates, EPS production was evaluated using three different staining techniques \n\nspecific for the different components of EPS. These techniques were performed to original \n\nsludge and samples collected from the SBR on days 17, 32, 45, 51, 60 and 66 of operation. \n\nEPS is a highly hydrated gel that acts as a cementing substance in biofilms and \n\nflocs (de Beer et al 1996). Generally, EPS are understood to be extracellular polymers \n\nmainly composed of microbial polysaccharides. However, other extracellular polymeric \n\nsubstances may also be associated with EPS, such as proteins, nucleic acids and polymeric \n\nlipophilic compounds (Neu et al 2001). In this work, Calcofluor white was utilized to stain \n\nthe ?-D-glucopyranose polysaccharides, FITC was used to stain proteins and other amine-\n\ncontaining compounds and Concanavalin A was bonded to ?-mannopyranosyl and ?-\n\nglucopyranosyl sugar residues.  \n\nTable 9 shows the results of EPS staining. It is possible to see that the EPS content \n\nwas inferior in the original sludge and on the 17th day of operation and it increased \n\nthroughout the reactor operation period. This leads to believe that EPS production could be \n\nrelated to the high toxicity of the HSSL, since EPS content suffered an increase throughout \n\nthe reactor operation. The production of EPS can be an inconvenience since it requires \n\nconsumption of substrate, deviating it from growth and PHA production, reducing the \n\nexpected productivities. \n\n \n\n\n\n 74 \n\nTable 9.

FISH results \n\n5.3.3.1. Microbial Community Identification \n\nThroughout the SBR operating period, it is necessary to monitor the population in \n\norder to identify the different groups of microorganisms and relate them with the storage \n\ncapacity and kinetics of the MMC (Queir\u00f3s et al 2015). For these motives, FISH analysis \n\nwas performed to original sludge and samples collected from the SBR on days 17, 32, 45, \n\n51, 60 and 66 of operation. \n\nIn order to decrease the cellular aggregates of the MMC, which may negatively \n\nimpact the visualization of FISH hybridised cells, a sludge pre-treatment using glass beads \n\nwas performed. Since cellular aggregation still remained too high, an ultrasound treatment \n\nwas applied, strongly reducing the size of microbial aggregates. \n\nInitially, specific probes for the main Phyla within Bacteria domain were applied. \n\nThe microbial community was mostly composed of Bacteria since no Archaea were \n\ndetected. The ratio between Bacteria that hybridized with EUBmix probe and the total \n\nDAPI stained cells was over 70%, which is a normal result for FISH characterization of \n\nactivated sludge samples. To continue the bacterial community identification, several FISH \n\nprobes were applied taking into consideration Bacteria previously reported as PHA-\n\naccumulating organisms. \n\nIn order to identify the microbial community and to follow the MMC composition \n\nthroughout the reactor operation, specific probes for the main groups within Bacteria \n\ndomain were applied: Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, \n\nDeltaproteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Flavobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Sphingobacteria, \n\nActinobacteria, Firmicutes, Planctomycetales (Table 5, section 3.7.6). \n\nFigure 21 shows the evolution of the composition during the reactor operation. \n\nSince the beginning of the process, Betaproteobacteria were the dominant group and the \n\nrelative abundance of Betaproteobacteria only suffered mild fluctuations during the whole \n\nreactor operation time. Since Betaproteobacteria were reported to possess PHA-producing \n\nability, this shows that the operational conditions applied during the SBR operation \n\nfavoured the maintenance of this group of bacteria within the MMC. Alphaproteobacteria \n\nwere the second most dominant group in the bacterial community throughout the SBR \n\noperational time. \n\n\n\n 77 \n\nThe bacteria community composition did not suffer major alterations throughout \n\nthe whole operational period. Flavobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Sphingobacteria \n\npercentage suffered an increase on day 45 (from 4.96 \u00b1 1.73% to 12.0 \u00b1 1.77%) and \n\nActinobacteria appeared in the culture on day 60 with a small percentage (0.65 \u00b1 0.13%). \n\n \n\nFigure 21. Bacterial community evolution throughout the SBR operation \n\n \n\nDue to the high aggregation of the cells in the sample from the original sludge \n\n(inoculum), FISH quantification for this sample was not possible. However, the group-\n\nspecific probes were also applied to this sample and after microscope observation of the \n\nresults, it was possible to infer that Betaproteobacteria was the dominant group in the \n\nbacterial community, followed by Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. \n\nAs previously mentioned, a stabilization of the culture occurred between the 60th \n\nand the 66th days and an apparent pseudo-stationary phase was established. By analysing \n\nthe bacterial composition in these days, it is possible to conclude that the bacterial \n\ncommunity did not suffer significant changes during this period. Betaproteobacteria \n\nremained as the dominant group and its relative abundance was constant during this period \n\n(42.99 \u00b1 0.38% on day 60 and 40.76 \u00b1 2.15% on day 66). \n\nPrevious studies from Albuquerque et al.

Analysis at genus level \n\n \n\nBacterial community identification continued using specific probes for genera \n\ninside Beta- and Alphaproteobacteria, since these were the dominant groups present in the \n\nculture. This evaluation was only performed for samples belonging to the pseudo-\n\nstationary phase (on 60th and 66th days). \n\nRegarding the Alphaproteobacteria group, specific probes for Sphingomonas (Beer \n\net al 2004), Defluvicoccus (Meyer et al 2006) and Defluvicoccus related Tetrad Forming \n\nOrganism (TFO-DF) (Wong et al 2004) were applied. Positive results were only obtained \n\nfor Defluvicoccus related TFO-DF (0.78 \u00b1 0.38%), as shown in Figure 22. \n\nA specific probe for Amaricoccus was also tested, since this genus was reported as \n\nhaving PHA-storing ability (Lemos et al 2008).

The identification of \n\nBetaproteobacteria by FISH analysis was only possible once the sequence data from 16S \n\nrRNA gene clone library was available. During the analysis of the sequence data, 16S \n\nrRNA gene sequences belonging to the Acidovorax genus appeared quite frequently. \n\nMoreover, Acidovorax was previously shown to be capable of PHA storage (Schulze et al \n\n1999). Schulze et al. (1999) developed the probe ACI145 based on 16S rRNA gene \n\nsequences of the available Acidovorax species. The probe ACI145 with the sequence 5'-\n\nTTTCGCTTCGTTATCCCC-3', was synthetized by BioFab (Rome, Italy) and applied to \n\nall samples. Positive results were obtained for all the screened samples and it was observed \n\nthat Acidovorax content in the microbial community increased from 2.62 \u00b1 0.93% (in day \n\n17) to 28.98 \u00b1 2.51% (in day 66). During the pseudo-stationary phase, the Acidovorax \n\ngenus became the major constituent of the Betaproteobacteria, constituting 71% of the \n\nBetaproteobacteria population on day 66 (Figure 25).

The sample used to extract the DNA \n\nwas collected from the SBR on the 66th day of operation. A total of 108 white colonies \n\nwere screened, and after performing PCR and electrophoresis to check the occurrence of \n\namplification, 60 clones were chosen for partial sequencing. The obtained 16S rDNA \n\npartial sequences were then analysed by BLAST and grouped by genera (Table 11). \n\nThe major part of the clones present in the clone library belonged to \n\nBetaproteobacteria class. Inside this class, genera Acidovorax and Simplicispira were the \n\nmost represented, but Rhodoferax, Comamonas, Ramlibacter, Hydrogenophaga, \n\nLimnohabitans, Giesbergeria, Albidiferax, Thauera, and Variovorax were also detected. \n\nThe second most dominant class was Alphaproteobacteria, including genera \n\nParacoccus, Agrobacterium and Shinella as the most represented and Catellibacterium and \n\nNovosphingobium in minor amounts. These results were also in line with the FISH \n\nanalysis. \n\nRegarding the less abundant genera in the clone library, the genus \n\nPseudoxanthomonas, belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria group, and genera \n\nLeadbetterella (Cytophagia group) and Salinirepens (Flavobacteria group) were also \n\nrecovered in the clone library. \n\nThese results were expected since, during the pseudo-stationary phase, \n\nBetaproteobacteria was the dominant group of the bacterial community (40.76 \u00b1 2.15%) \n\nfollowed by Alfaproteobacteria (12.68 \u00b1 0.79 %) and Gammaproteobacteria was only \n\npresent at a small percentage (2.55 \u00b1 0.54). \n\nSome species of Acidovorax (Schulze et al 1999), Thauera (Dionisi et al 2005c), \n\nComamonas (Saito and Doi 1994), Paracoccus (Ueda et al 1992) and Hydrogenophaga \n\n(Choi et al 1999)  genera were already described as PHA-accumulating organisms. \n\nFerreira et al. (2015) isolated and characterized organisms able to store PHA, from \n\na MMC selected under ADF conditions. A16S rRNA gene clonal analysis was performed \n\nand clones related to Comamonas spp. and Novosphingobium spp. were also detected. \n\nHowever, in the work of Ferreira et al. (2015), the MMC selection was performed using \n\nunfermented HSSL, which can explain the differences in the microbial community \n\ncomposition.   \n\n\n\n84 \n\nTable 11.

The evolutionary history was inferred using the Maximum Likelihood method based on \n\nthe Tamura-Nei model (Tamura and Nei 1993).  \n\nAll the sequences were related to each other and to PHA-producing \n\nmicroorganisms already described in the literature and previously found in culture \n\nselection processes for PHA production. Six (CR1, CR2, CR8, CR9, CR14 and CR15) of \n\nthe 15 sequences were related to Acidovorax. Clones CR1, CR2 and CR15 were closely \n\nrelated to Acidovorax caeni and clones CR8 and CR14 to Acidovorax radicis. Contrarily to \n\nwhat was revealed by the BLAST search, the clone CR9 was closer to Acidovorax \n\nwautersii than to Simplicispira metamorpha. Clone CR15 was also closer to Acidovorax \n\ncaeni than to Simplicispira metamorpha. Two sequences (CR5 and CR10) were related to \n\nComamonas testosteroni. Sequences CR3, CR4, CR6, CR7, CR11, CR12, and CR13 were \n\nrelated to Fluviicola taffensis, Leadbetterella byssophila, Paracoccus siganidrum, \n\nAgrobacterium tumefaciens, Alcaligenes aquatilis, Shinella zoogloeoides and \n\nPseudoxanthomonas kaohsiungensis, respectively. \n\nLampropedia hyalina (Beccari et al 2010; Valentino et al 2014), Azoarcus sp. \n\n(Serafim et al 2006), Thauera sp.

(Moita and Lemos 2012) are microorganisms with phylogenetic \n\nrelationships with the clones and are known PHA producers previously found in MMC \n\nselection processes for PHA production. Moreover, Alcaligenes sp. (Doi et al 1990; Yu et \n\nal 1999) is a well known PHA producer. Comamonas testosteroni (Kasuya et al 1994) and \n\nAcidovorax facilis (Mergaert et al 1993) were already described as PHA degrading \n\nmicroorganisms. Once again, these results prove that the culture selection process was \n\nsuccessful. \n\n\n\n 87 \n\n \nFigure 27.

Concluding remarks \n\nIn this work, a three-step process was used for PHA production. In the first step, \n\nHSSL, a by-product of pulp industry, was submitted to acidogenic fermentation in order to \n\nproduce a mixture rich in VFAs, which was used as substrate in the next two steps. In the \n\nsecond step, a SBR was operated for 70 days under ADF conditions in order to select a \n\nMMC able to produce PHA. A pseudo-stationary state was reached after 60 days of SBR \n\noperation, which indicated that the MMC was able to successfully adapt to the carbon \n\nsource. In the third step, the ability of the selected MMC to accumulate PHA was tested. \n\nThree accumulation tests were performed and the selected MMC reached a maximum PHA \n\ncontent of 47.1%. \n\nFISH analysis showed that Betaproteobacteria was the dominant phylogenetic \n\ngroup in the bacterial community. On day 66, Betaproteobacteria constituted 40.8 \u00b1 2.2% \n\nof total bacteria. The remaining bacteria belonged mostly to the Alphaproteobacteria (12.7 \n\n\u00b1 0.8%), Gammaproteobacteria (2.55 \u00b1 0.5%) and Bacteroidetes (14.9 \u00b1 1.7%) groups. \n\nInside Betaproteobacteria, a considerable amount of Acidovorax (28.9 \u00b1 3.1%) was \n\ndetected. The typical genera found in MMCs selected in SBRs operated under ADF \n\nconditions, Thauera and Azoarcus, were only found in small amounts.  \n\nNile Blue results revealed the high abundance of PHA inclusion bodies that were \n\nmaintained since the beginning of SBR operational period. \n\nClone library results presented several clones that were already described as PHA-\n\nproducers. These results also matched with the FISH analysis, since the major part of the \n\nclones belonged to the Betaproteobacteria group. Moreover, a significant number of \n\nclones belonged to the Acidovorax genera, which was already described as a PHA-\n\nproducer. Phylogenetic analysis proved that the clones were related with PHA-producing \n\norganisms.  \n\nThe results obtained in this work showcase the potential of the three-step process \n\nfor PHA production. With 70 days of SBR operation, a culture with high abundance of \n\nPHA producing organisms was selected, which indicates that the selection process was \n\nwell performed. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n 91 \n\n7. Future prospects \n\nAs already mentioned the MMC response during the selection process is influenced \n\nby different factors. For this motive, this research should focus on the influence of the \n\nreactor operating conditions in the MMC selection process. Some of the operational \n\nconditions to be studied are: SRT, HRT, pH, temperature, cycle length, OLR, influent \n\nsubstrate concentration and nutrient concentration. PHA production under phosphorus and \n\nammonium limitation should also be the target of further investigation.  \n\nIt is known that the VFA mixture made available to the PHA-storing \n\nmicroorganisms will influence the PHA composition and HB:HV ratio, which in turn \n\naffects PHA physical and mechanical properties. Testing different operational conditions \n\nduring the acidogenic fermentation step to determine their influence in VFA production \n\nand in polymer composition should also be considered. \n\nThroughout the SBR operational time, Acidovorax content suffered an increase. \n\nSince this organism is a known PHA accumulator, a bioaugmentation strategy can be \n\nadopted in order to promote the Acidovorax growth inside the bacterial community. This \n\nstudy should focus on factors such as Acidovorax growth conditions, VFA preference and \n\npossible changes in the operational conditions. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n 93 \n\n8.
