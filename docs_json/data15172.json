No presente trabalho foi demonstrado a deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de filmes finos \nde \u00f3xido de zinco (ZnO) por ALD de elevada uniformidade em diferentes \nsubstratos, inclu\u00eddo nano-estruturas como por exemplo, nanotubos de carbono. \nDemonstrou-se por difrac\u00e7\u00e3o de raio-X que o processo de deposi\u00e7\u00e3o do ZnO \noriginou a forma\u00e7\u00e3o da estrutura da hexagonal, na fase wurtzite, com uma taxa \nde crescimento por ciclo de 1.9 \u00c5. A deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de filmes finos de natureza \ninorg\u00e2nica (e.g. \u00f3xidos met\u00e1licos) por ALD est\u00e1 bem estabelecida \ncontrariamente \u00e0 emergente deposi\u00e7\u00e3o por camada molecular (MLD) de filmes \nfinos puramente org\u00e2nicos. Actualmente, a combina\u00e7\u00e3o de ALD/MLD come\u00e7a a \nganhar import\u00e2ncia na cria\u00e7\u00e3o de estruturas h\u00edbridas do tipo org\u00e2nica-\ninorg\u00e2nicas. Nomeadamente, atrav\u00e9s da selec\u00e7\u00e3o adequada dos precursores, \u00e9 \nposs\u00edvel obter diferentes arquitecturas funcionais em forma de filme fino, \nincluindo nano-laminados, superestruturas e redes metalo-org\u00e2nicas (MOFs) \nnano-porosas. A deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de MOFs por ALD/MLD surge como uma alternativa \npara superar as desvantagens dos m\u00e9todos convencionais de deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de \nfilmes finos baseados em solu\u00e7\u00f5es. Este trabalho contempla tamb\u00e9m a revis\u00e3o \nda literatura no que diz respeito \u00e0 s\u00edntese de este tipo de filmes finos obtidos em \nfase de vapor. Procedeu-se \u00e0 reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o dos resultados da literatura tendo \ncomo objectivo a s\u00edntese de filmes finos h\u00edbridos org\u00e2nico-inorg\u00e2nicos \n(e.g. MOFs). Numa primeira fase efectuou-se a transforma\u00e7\u00e3o vapor-s\u00f3lido de \num filme de ZnO crescido por ALD por exposi\u00e7\u00e3o ao vapor de 2-metilimidazol. \nPosteriormente usou-se um processo ALD/MLD com o prop\u00f3sito de depositar \numa estrutura do tipo ze\u00f3lito (ZIF-8) a partir da reac\u00e7\u00e3o do dietilzinco (DEZ) e o \n2-metilimidazol. Finalmente realizou-se a s\u00edntese de dois sistemas de filmes \nfinos h\u00edbridos com base no \u00e1cido tereft\u00e1lico como precursor org\u00e2nico e os \nseguintes precursores organomet\u00e1licos: DEZ e Eu(TMHD)3. Para o caso do \nsistema DEZ/TPA, a forma\u00e7\u00e3o da liga\u00e7\u00e3o Zn-TP nos filmes h\u00edbridos, foi \nobservada por espectroscopia de FTIR. \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n\n \nAtomic Layer Deposition (ALD), Molecular Layer Deposition (MLD), organic-\ninorganic hybrid, thin films, vapor phase, Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs), \nzinc oxide (ZnO), diethylzinc (DEZ), 2-methylimidazole (HmIM), Cu(TMHD)2, \nEu(TMHD)3, terephthalic acid (TPA) \n \n\nabstract \n\n \nAtomic layer deposition is a state-of-the-art vapor phase deposition method for \nthe creation of high quality thin films with nanoscale thickness control. As \ndemonstrated in this work by the deposition of ZnO with a home-built reactor, \nALD enables uniform and conformal film deposition even on complex \nnanostructures like carbon nanotubes. Deposition of hexagonal wurtzite ZnO \nproven by GIXRD with a growth-per-cycle of 1.9 \u00c5, determined from XRR \nthickness measurements, was demonstrated. While the ALD synthesis of \ninorganic thin films, such as metal oxides is widely established, the organic \ncounterpart molecular layer deposition (MLD) is still emerging. Recently, \ncombining ALD/MLD has attracted great interest for the creation of organic-\ninorganic hybrid structures. By choice and adaptation of suitable precursors a \ngreat versatility of functional thin film architectures is achievable, spanning from \nnovel multilayer nanolaminates and superstructures for thermoelectrics, over \nluminescent lanthanide hybrid films for optical application to even crystalline, \n\nnanoporous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as low-? dielectrics in \nmicrodevices. Especially in the field of MOFs, a clean and precise synthesis route \nby ALD/MLD is desirable for device implementation in order to overcome the \ndrawbacks of conventional, solution-based thin film deposition techniques. In this \nwork, recent advances towards these vapor-processed hybrids are reviewed. \nThen, the reproduction of literature results leading to the deposition of organic-\ninorganic hybrid thin films (e.g. MOFs) was studied. The feasibility of a vapor-\nsolid transformation of a sacrificial ALD-grown ZnO film by exposure to 2-\nmethylimidazole (HMIM) and a direct ALD/MLD method using HMIM and \ndiethylzinc (DEZ) towards a zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF-8) have been \nattempted. Finally, the synthesis of two different hybrid films was studied \ninvolving the organic precursor terephthalic acid (TPA) combined with the \norganometallic precursors DEZ or Eu(TMHD)3. In case of the DEZ/TPA system, \nthe deposition of a hybrid thin film with Zn-terephthalate bondings was evidenced \nby FTIR spectroscopy. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nCONTENT  \n\nContent \n \n\n1 Introduction ........................................................................................................................................................ 1 \n\n2 Objectives ............................................................................................................................................................ 3 \n\n3 Atomic and Molecular Layer Deposition (ALD/MLD) .......................................................................... 5 \n\n4 Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) ........................................................................................................... 9 \n\n5 Review of vapor-based MOF synthesis ..................................................................................................... 13 \n\n6 Characterization Methods ............................................................................................................................ 19 \n\n6.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy \n\n(STEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDX) .................................................... 19 \n\n6.2 Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) ..................................................................................................... 22 \n\n6.3 X-Ray Reflectometry (XRR) ............................................................................................................... 23 \n\n6.4 Grazing Incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) .............................................................................. 24 \n\n6.5 Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) ................................................................................................ 26 \n\n6.6 Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) ........................................................................ 26 \n\n6.7 Raman spectroscopy .............................................................................................................................. 27 \n\n6.8 Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) ...................................................................................... 28 \n\n7 Experimental.................................................................................................................................................... 31 \n\n7.1 Description of the ALD reactor .......................................................................................................... 31 \n\n7.2 Used precursors and their thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) ................................................. 33 \n\n7.3 ALD of ZnO thin films ......................................................................................................................... 35 \n\n7.4 Attempts towards ZIF-8 MOF thin films ....................................................................................... 36 \n\n7.4.1 MOF-CVD of sacrificial ZnO films ............................................................................................... 36 \n\n7.4.2 MOF-ALD/MLD by DEZ and HMIM ....................................................................................... 37 \n\n7.5 Direct routes towards terephthalate hybrid thin films ................................................................. 38 \n\n7.5.1 ALD/MLD by DEZ and TPA ....................................................................................................... 38 \n\n7.5.2 ALD/MLD by Eu(TMHD)3 and TPA ......................................................................................... 39 \n\n8 Results &amp;

The objective is to profit from enhanced properties or to wipe out undesired \n\nfeatures.1 This concept is employed in modern composites like glass or carbon fiber reinforced \n\npolymers or cermets, which gain superior mechanical properties. In these examples different material \n\nclasses (polymers, metals, ceramics etc.) are combined on a macroscopic level with a filler in a matrix \n\nmaterial. This approach would be rather considered as materials engineering. In contrast, chemists \n\nhave always dealt with molecules and have recently brought the concept of composites to a nanoscale \n\n(Figure 1). In the last few decades hybrid materials have become a rapidly growing trend and have \n\nrevolutionized design possibilities to create novel material structures. Hybrid materials are composed \n\nof at least two components, usually an organic and inorganic component, that are molecularly \n\ndispersed.2 The birth of these hybrids is closely related to the development of Sol-gel processes in the \n\n1980s, which use the reaction of molecular precursors in a liquid phase to form bulk materials. This \n\nsynthesis route has been an inspiring playground for material scientists and has, for instance, created \n\nthe class of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with plenty of envisioned applications. As the \n\nminiaturization trend has caught wide fields of science, and has created a new field called \n\n\u201cnanotechnology\u201d, also the processing of these hybrid materials has been improved. Thin film \n\ndeposition of hybrid materials is demanded by the microelectronics industry and is driven by the \n\ntechnological progress, for instance in vapor-phase deposition methods. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1: Concept of hybrid material formation based on the interdispersion of organic and inorganic \n\ncomponents on the nanoscale. Taken from Stassen et al., and edited.3 \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nOBJECTIVES 3 \n\n2 Objectives \n\nThe main task of this Master project is to review recent advances in the thin film deposition of organic-\n\ninorganic hybrids by Atomic and Molecular Layer Deposition (ALD/MLD) and to perform some \n\nexperiments in this area. A special focus is given to an emerging class of porous hybrids, namely metal-\n\norganic Frameworks (MOFs). The following chapter will give an introduction into ALD and MLD. \n\nThe historic development and main features of these advanced thin film growth techniques including \n\nbenefits and limitations will be summarized. Furthermore, MOFs will be introduced and discussed \n\nwith regard to synthesis routes, challenges and potential applications. Subsequently, in an \n\nexperimental part, an understanding of the ALD/MLD process was gained by working with a non-\n\ncommercial, home-built ALD reactor. In early stage experiments, experience about the ALD technique \n\nwas gathered by deposition of purely inorganic ZnO by sequential use of the precursors H2O and \n\ndiethylzinc (DEZ). These films were consecutively exposed to gaseous 2-methylimidazole (HMIM) \n\ntargeting a vapor-solid transformation of the sacrificial ZnO into a zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF-\n\n8). Feasibility of a direct ALD/MLD route towards this ZIF-8 was moreover studied. Finally, it has \n\nbeen attempted to reproduce some recent literature results concerning terephthalate hybrid thin films \n\ninvolving precursors, such as terephthalic acid (TPA), DEZ and the lanthanide containing \n\nEu(TMHD)3. These first studies with the here used ALD/MLD reactor system explore thin film \n\ndeposition of organic-inorganic hybrid structures on the road to vapor-based MOF synthesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nALD/MLD 5 \n\n3 Atomic and Molecular Layer Deposition (ALD/MLD) \n\nThe origins of Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) date back to the early 1970s and were initiated by the \n\nworks of Suntola et al., in Finland.4-7 The development was mainly driven by the microelectronics \n\nindustry searching for solutions for depositing high-? dielectrics, such as metal oxides, namely in the \n\nfield of electroluminescent flat panel displays (TFEL). The fact that a first EU patent in 1974 was \n\nfollowed by the first research paper in 1980 shows that the development of the ALD technique was \n\napplication driven. ALD was referred as Atomic Layer Epitaxy (ALE) in the early years. The great \n\nsuccess of ALD is mirrored by the large increase of publication numbers shown in Figure 2. Since the \n\nbreakthrough around 2000 the technique has become an established thin film vapor phase deposition \n\nmethod among others like for example Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) and Chemical Vapor \n\nDeposition (CVD). In the following years it has not just been exploited by microelectronics, but has \n\nbeen used as a mainstream technology in wide fields ranging from nano- to biotechnology. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2: Number of articles annually published on \n\nALD in Web of Science accessed in 2011 (keywords: \n\n\u201catomic layer deposition\u201d or \u201catomic layer epitaxy\u201d). \n\nTaken from Pinna and Knez.7 \n\n \n\nFigure 3: Number of articles annually published \n\nfeaturing organic and hybrid organic-inorganic thin films \n\nby MLD and ALD/MLD. Taken from Sundberg and \n\nKarppinen.8 \n\n  \nThe material range has been widely broadened in the 1990s (Figure 3) by the introduction of organic \n\nprecursors for Molecular Layer Deposition (MLD). As shown in Figure 4 molecules are grown in a \n\nsequential layer-by-layer fashion. Recently, in the late 2000s the combined ALD/MLD deposition of \n\norganic-inorganic hybrid thin films has become popular.8 This opened various possibilities for fine-\n\ntuning of thin film properties by creating hybrid mixtures, superstructures and nanolaminates (Figure \n\n5). Electronic, optical and mechanical properties, porosity, crystallinity degrees, surface roughness or \n\nrefractive indices can be influenced by the choice and sequence of precursors. The book of Pinna and \n\nKnez7 and the reviews of George9, 10 give complete overviews about various aspects of inorganic ALD \n\nand its organic counterpart MLD. The paper of Sundberg and Karppinen8 especially provides a broad \n\nreview of organic-inorganic hybrid thin films and a collection of used organic precursors. Moreover, \n\nvan Bui reviews the novel application fields of combined ALD/MLD \u201coff the beaten track\u201d.11 \n\n\n\n \n\nALD/MLD 6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nFigure 4: An ALD/MLD cycle consisting of four steps: (1) the \nfirst pulsed (inorganic) precursor reacts with the surface species, \n(2) the excess precursor and possible byproducts are removed \nfrom the reactor, either by purging with inert gas, such as N2 or \nAr, or by evacuation, (3) the second (organic) precursor is pulsed \nto the reactor and it reacts with the surface species, and finally \n(4) the excess precursor/possible byproducts are removed from \nthe reactor. In an ideal case a monolayer of a hybrid inorganic\u2013\norganic material is formed. The cycle is repeated to reach a \ntargeted film thickness. Taken from Sundberg and Karppinen.8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nFigure 5: Schematic illustration of purely organic \n\nthin films grown by MLD (left) and hybrid \n\ninorganic-organic thin films by ALD/MLD (right). \n\nTaken from Sundberg and Karppinen.8 \n\n \n\nThe main feature of ALD/MLD is the sequential and self-limiting deposition character at moderate \n\ntemperatures that is fundamentally different from other vapor-based methods such as PVD, which is \n\npurely physical and does not involve reactions, or the continuous gas phase reaction of CVD. In \n\nALD/MLD different gaseous precursors are injected into the reaction chamber in a cyclic manner \n\nincluding purging steps in between. In an ideal process at any time there is only one precursor species \n\npresent in the chamber that fully saturates and reacts with the surface and there is no self-reaction of \n\nthe precursors.  Step coverage of atomic or molecular layers and the self-terminated surface reaction \n\nare typical for ALD/MLD. Therefore, the growth of thin films and their thickness can be controlled \n\non the nanoscale. \n\n \n\nThe prototype ALD/MLD process uses at least two precursors, but in principle more precursors may \n\nbe used for multicomponent or multilayer systems. The precursor requirements comprise high vapor \n\npressure, which means high volatility at the deposition temperatures, in order to saturate the reaction \n\nchamber volume. Good thermal stability is needed in order to avoid decomposition before surface \n\nreaction. Organic precursors with stiff backbones in MLD can prevent multiple or bridging reactions. \n\nChemisorption on the substrate and fast and complete reaction are necessary and may require a \n\nsubstrate surface preparation.  Potential by-products should not etch the surface. The choice of suitable \n\nprecursors is indeed one of the most important factors for a working deposition process.7 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nALD/MLD 7 \n\nThe ideal, self-limiting growth affords sufficiently long precursor pulsing and purging steps. In \n\npractice, surface saturation in the pulsing steps is often only partially achieved. Therefore a growth \n\nrate for the average increase in film thickness during one growth cycle is introduced. This growth-\n\nper-cycle value (GPC) is also an important measure with regard to the growth mode. If the GPC stays \n\nconstant during the deposition cycles, the growth is linear. Especially in the beginning during the \n\nnucleation process, growth can be inhibited or enhanced by the chemical compatibility of the substrate \n\nsurface leading to an initially increasing or decreasing GPC. The GPC is dependent on growth \n\nparameters, such as temperature, pressure or precursor pulsing time and flow as shown in Figure 6. \n\nFor a linear process the growth parameters define a so called \u201cALD window\u201d with constant GPC. \n\nOutside the window the GPC can be lower due to insufficient reactivity at low temperatures or \n\nprecursor desorption at high temperatures; Or the GPC can be higher due to strong precursor \n\ncondensation at low temperatures or precursor decomposition at high temperatures. The precursor \n\npulse time can also influence the GPC. Too short pulse times may not be sufficient to saturate the \n\nsurface. Too long pulsing time can also lead to precursor decomposition and increasing GPC or time \n\ncan be given to etching reactions that decrease the GPC. However, a growth in the ALD window is \n\nnot necessarily a prerequisite for a well-functioning process.8 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6: Dependence of the GPC on pulse time (left) and temperature (right) for different growth modes. Taken \n\nfrom Pinna and Knez.7 \n\n \n\nTo summarize, the benefits of the ALD/MLD method are the nanoscale thickness control, uniformity \n\nof thin film composition, film conformality even on complex structures, high film quality without \n\npinholes, large area capability and the vast possibilities for multilayer structures design. These features \n\nare highly interesting for nanodevices fabrication. The limitations are the low deposition rates \n\ncompared to CVD or PVD due to the slow deposition in sequences with a distinct growth-per-cycle \n\nvalue in the range of only a few \u00c5ngstroms. The choice of well-behaving precursors together with a \n\nsuitable substrate lead to limitations in the material selection. A lot of research is still needed in finding \n\noptimal combinations, in particular in combined ALD/MLD. Precursor specific limitations, like \n\n\n\n \n\nALD/MLD 8 \n\nagglomeration behaviour for metallic films (Cu, Pt, Au) or non-sharp interfaces with Si have to be \n\nconsidered in ALD. In particular in MLD, steric hindrances of long organic molecules can lead to \n\nimperfect growth for example. Encountered difficulties with organic precursors are discussed by \n\nGeorge et al.,10 Reactive byproducts can etch the surface, precursors can decompose before reacting \n\nwith the surface or precursor diffusion into the growing film might add a non-ideal, unwanted CVD \n\ncharacter to the actually sequential ALD/MLD process.\n\n\n\n \n\nMOFs 9 \n\n4 Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) \n\nMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a highly topical class of nanoporous, crystalline coordination \n\nnetworks held together by strong bonds.12-14 These frameworks contain interconnected polytopic \n\norganic linker molecules and metal-based nodes as schematically shown in Figure 7.  As a matter of \n\nfact, a new class of materials needs its own terminology and consequently many efforts were done for \n\nan exact classification. This included many controversial discussions between different scientific \n\ncommunities coming from different backgrounds.15 IUPAC categorizes MOFs as a subset of \n\n\u201ccoordination networks\u201d, which are another subset of the most general term \u201ccoordination \n\npolymers\u201d.16, 17 As a \u201ccoordination network\u201d a MOF requires \u201crepeating coordination entities in 1 \n\ndimension with cross-links between two or more individual chains, loops or spiro-links, or a coordination \n\ncompound extending through repeating coordination entities in 2 or 3 dimensions\u201d.  However, in a more \n\ngeneral scientific language MOFs are often related to the more fashionable, broadly used, but arguable \n\nterm \u201corganic-inorganic hybrid materials\u201d. This definition emphasizes the fact that MOFs necessarily \n\ncontain organic and inorganic moieties and highlights the contrast between covalent and ionocovalent \n\nbonds. Thus, a terminology distinction is drawn relatively to other porous materials like the purely \n\ninorganic zeolites or the purely covalent organic frameworks (COF).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7: Schematic representation of a MOF formed by \n\ninorganic connection points (metal centers) and organic \n\nlinker molecules. Organic coordination polymers offer \n\nlarge variability (length, shape, branching etc.) in \n\nisoreticular chemistry for designing the pore interior. \n\nAdditionally, functionalized linkers can enable properties \n\nsuch as catalytic activity. Taken from Ma et al.19 \n\n \n\nFigure 8: MOF structures (1D, 2D, and 3D) \n\nreported in the Cambridge Structural Database \n\n(CSD) from 1971 to 2011. The trend shows a \n\nstriking increase for all structure types. In \n\nparticular, the doubling time for the number of 3D \n\nMOFs (inset) is the highest among all reported \n\nMOF structures. Taken from Furukawa et al.14 \n\n  \n\nThe connectivity between metal nodes and organic linkers follows various coordination geometries \n\n(tetrahedral, octahedral etc.) and leads to structures of different dimensionality (1D chains, 2D sheets, \n\n3D networks).18 For instance, this coordination chemistry is dependent on preferred coordination \n\nnumbers and geometries of metal ions and the flexibility and (multi)functionality of the organic linkers. \n\n\n\n \n\nMOFs 10 \n\nFurthermore, the synthesis conditions, such as temperature or pH and thermodynamic and kinetic \n\nfactors play an important role in the formation of these frameworks. The assembly of repeatedly linked \n\nstructures is controlled on purpose by combining building units and is referred as reticular chemistry. \n\nIn the last years the MOF research has created a large variety of new structures as pictured in Figure \n\n8. This structural flexibility is due to the diverse combination and design possibilities of organic linkers \n\nand metal centers. Therefore, MOFs have a high chemical mutability for functionalization and \n\npotential for fine tuning structure-property relationships.  \n\nIn the IUPAC recommendations is stated that MOFs have to fulfil the criteria of \u201cpotential voids\u201d, but \n\ndo not require physical measurements of porosity per se.17 However, permanent porosity and the \n\nphysical and chemical properties arising from it are a characteristic feature on which MOF research is \n\nmainly based on. Accordingly, IUPAC gives terminology recommendations for the classification of \n\nporous materials.20 Microporous materials contain pores below 2 nm, mesoporous materials contain \n\npores between 2 and 50 nm and macroporous materials have pore sizes larger than 50 nm. Despite \n\nthese recommendations, but naturally from a linguistic point of view, the term nanoporous is \n\nfrequently used to classify MOFs as materials with nm-sized pores. The porosity as a main MOF \n\nattribute can be engineered due to reticular framework chemistry. Series of isoreticular frameworks of \n\nsame topology with tuneable pore size are synthesized by variation of linker length or \n\nfunctionalization. One of the most prominent and influencing works in this field was presented by \n\nEddaoudi et al., in 2002 for the prototypic MOF-5 as illustrated in Figure 9.21 Pore sizes from \n\n0.39 to 2.88 nm were reported for topologically similar frameworks. \n\n \n\nFigure 9: Single crystal X-ray structures of isoreticular series of the three-dimensional MOF-5 framework with \n\ntuneable pore sizes from 0.39 to 2.88 nm reported by Eddaouidi, O'Keeffe, Yaghi et al.21 This structural versatility \n\nis possible by use of several organic, carboxylic linkers (C: black, O: red) interconnecting the Zn-center that form \n\ncoordination polyhedra (blue). Yellow spheres visualize the pore volume. Hydrogen atoms are omitted. \n\n \n\nAnother prototypic class of MOF structures are zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) which are \n\ntopologically similar to zeolites. ZIFs are composed of tetrahedrally coordinated transition metal ions \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_metal\n\n\n \n\nMOFs 11 \n\nlike Fe, Co, Cu, Zn connected with imidazolate type linkers. Solvothermal synthesis of various ZIF \n\nstructures were presented by Park et al., and exhibit permanent porosity combined with high thermal \n\nstability up to 550 \u00b0C and chemical resistance to boiling alkaline water and organic solvents.22 Among \n\nthese frameworks the ZIF-8, which contains 2-methylimidazole (HMIM) linkers, is the most \n\nprominent and shows pore diameters of 1.16 nm and a theoretical specific surface area of 1947 m\u00b2/g \n\nbased on calculations on the single crystal X-ray structure as illustrated in Figure 10.  \n\n \n\nFigure 10: Single crystal X-ray structure of the three-dimensional zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF-8. The \n\nframework structure is topologically similar to zeolites and formed by the illustrated building units. The three \n\nimages show a stick model (left), a tiling model (center) and the framework structure containing HMIM linkers \n\n(C: black, N: green) and forming ZnN4 tetrahedra in blue (right). Yellow spheres visualize the pore volume. \n\nHydrogen atoms are omitted. Taken from Park et al.22  \n\n \n\nThe pore interior is a unique property that allows for incorporation of molecules and makes MOFs \n\nideal candidates for host-guest structures. In the beginning, MOF research focused mainly on \n\napplication fields like catalysis, gas adsorption and storage or molecular separation.14, 23 Hence, for a \n\nlong time the design of open structures and exceptionally high internal surface area and adsorption \n\ncapacities was the driving force in the field. Furthermore, host-guest interactions can be realized due \n\nto the MOF porosity. In the review of Ricco et al., it is emphasized on biotechnological applications in \n\ndrug release and delivery, biological sensing and imaging and highlights the use of MOFs as \n\ncrystallization matrices.24 MOF matrices can be used as crystal hosts for structural analysis of \n\nnanogram quantities by X-ray diffraction (XRD), for macromolecule encapsulation, as protecting \n\nenvironment for enzyms in biocatalysis or for biomimetic mineralization.  \n\nTwo approaches are followed to tailor the functional properties of MOFs. Firstly, the structure-\n\nproperty relation of the MOF framework itself can be adapted by choice of suitable metal nodes and \n\nlinkers with desired features. As a good example, the multifunctional properties of lanthanide MOFs \n\n(LnMOFs) were emphasized in some highly cited papers stating out the porous, luminescent and \n\nmagnetic properties.25-27 In particular, Cui et al., give a detailed review about luminescent MOFs.28 The \n\nlanthanide ions act as metal centers with intense photoluminescence. By the antenna effect proper \n\norganic coordination ligands can improve the luminescent properties through optical excitation, \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazolate\n\n\n \n\nMOFs 12 \n\nenergy transfer from the ligand to the lanthanide centers and the final distinct, optical emission by the \n\nrare earth ions. Secondly, the host property of MOFs is exploited by adding guests with functional \n\nproperties into the framework. For instance, Falcaro et al., review the integration of metal and metal-\n\noxide nanoparticles@MOFs.29 This enables and enhances a wide range of applications in sensing, \n\nplasmonics, pollutant sequestration, separation, fuel production or biomedical solutions. \n\nBased on the great versatility of MOFs the aforementioned trends in a variety of fields demonstrate \n\nthe dynamic and fast developments of an emerging community. After a long research period on the \n\ntraditional topics gas adsorption or catalysis, recently, research on MOF focuses also on electrical and \n\nionic conduction, energy harvesting and emission or magnetic, dielectric and mechanical properties. \n\nThis is justified by the great interest of the microelectronic industry to integrate organic-inorganic \n\nhybrid materials \u2013 and in particular MOFs - into microdevices, such as active sensor coatings, low- ? \n\ndielectrics or tuneable conductors.30 In the review of Stassen et al.,3 some case studies for MOFs in \n\nelectronic devices like FETs or resistive memories are presented. In addition, applications of MOFs in \n\nmass sensitive, chemical and opto-electronic sensors are highlighted. A final SWOT analysis \n\n(strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) assesses the value of MOFs for use in electronic devices. \n\nThe challenge in this research field is finding an optimal route for thin film deposition that adequately \n\nfits the everlasting miniaturization trend.31 Thin film deposition methods have been widely studied for \n\nthis reason, but mainly by solution based methods.32 Despite the promising properties and applicability \n\nof MOF thin films for various purposes mainly the paradigm of this solution-based synthesis methods \n\nfor MOFs prevented device implementation up to now.3 Conventional chemical solution deposition \n\n(CSD), also referred as sol-gel methods, typically rely on the reaction of a metal salt precursor with a \n\nlinker either at room temperature33 or under hydro- or solvothermal conditions at increased \n\ntemperatures up to 220 \u00b0C as reviewed by Lee et al..34 Various precursors, reaction sequences, substrate \n\npre-treatments and deposition conditions have been reported. The benefit of the simple, flexible and \n\neffective CSD approach is the cheap and easy implementation on the labscale. However, numerous \n\ndrawbacks of this wet chemical practices have to be considered after Stassen et al.35 Especially surface-\n\ntension-related phenomena like incomplete wetting or meniscus formation play an important role in \n\nliquid systems. Consequent substrate swelling or dissolution are main issues of wet chemistry \n\napproaches. Compared to vapor-based methods wet chemistry faces upscaling problems as the \n\nhandling of larger solvent amounts creates more waste and therefore cost and sustainability concerns. \n\nFurthermore, working with large volumes of toxic solvents can be hazardous. Moreover, wet chemical \n\nmethods are disadvantageous because of contamination risks. As CSD typically uses metal salts, \n\ncontaining for example nitrates or chlorides, reaction chambers are exposed to corrosion problems \n\nand, above all, sample impurities are not tolerable in electronic devices. The use of high purity solvents \n\ncould address a cleaner process, but would be very costly. Surprisingly, up to now not much attention \n\nhas been given to clean vapor-phase based methods in MOF synthesis.\n\n\n\n \n\nREVIEW 13 \n\n5 Review of vapor-based MOF synthesis \n\nA long time MOF research focused on tuning chemical and physical bulk properties for fields like gas \n\nadsorption or catalysis. Due to great versatility and developments in MOF synthesis, recently, novel \n\napplication fields in the microelectronic industry become interesting. The aforementioned drawbacks \n\nof conventional powder synthesis have to be overcome and primarily justify the aim of finding a clean \n\nvapor-based route for MOF synthesis, preferably in a clean room environment. For device integration \n\na paradigm shift has to follow and is seen as the key for implementation of MOFs into electronic \n\ndevices. This evolution is formulated in the consecutive roadmaps of Allendorf et al., (2011) and Stassen \n\net al., (2017). Microfabrication of MOFs by thin film deposition and patterning are highlighted.  \n\n \n\nIn the following review recent advances of vapor-based techniques for the synthesis of MOFs will be \n\nillustrated with concrete examples. Synthesis routes of the latest publications will be categorized and \n\ndiscussed. Research potentials and challenges will be summarized.  Recently, Stassen et al.,35 have \n\nalready identified state-of-the art approaches and directions that have been used in a few number of \n\npublications involving vapor-based methods as shown in Table 1.  \n\n \n\nTable 1: Summary of vapor-phase involving methods after the categorization and with illustrations of Stassen \n\net al.35 The two papers marked with a * are the only approaches completely based on vapor-phase methods leading \n\nto crystalline MOFs. \n\nCategory Synthesis route MOF class Ref. \n\nSacrificial metal \noxide method \n\n1) Linker solution \n \n\nZn3(BTC)2 \nCu3(BTC)2 \nMIL-53 \nAl(OH)(ndc) \nZIF-8 \nAl2(OH)2TCCP \nCu3(BTC)2 \n\n(40) \n(41) \n(42) \n(43) \n(44) \n(45) \n(46) \n\n2) Melted linker phase \n \n \n \n \n \n\nZIF-8 \nZIF-8 \n\n \n(47) \n(48) \n\n \n \n\n3) Vaporized linker \n \n\n \nZIF-8 \n\n \n(30)* \n\n \n\nGaseous \norganometallic \nprecursor \n(ALD/MLD) \n\n4) Direct crystallization \n \n5) Post crystallization needed \n\n \n\n \nMOF-2 \n \nMOF-5 (a.k.a.

Following the summary in Table 1 in more detail, several multi-\n\nstep methods can be classified into sacrificial metal oxide methods, and in organometallic precursor \n\nroutes. In the first category a metal oxide like ZnO is deposited by ALD or PVD, and then transformed \n\ninto a MOF in a subsequent step. This conversion can either be of (1) solvothermal nature using a \n\nlinker containing solution, or promoted by a (2) melted linker phase, or (3) by a vaporized linker in a \n\nCVD process. These sacrificial methods are all multi-step methods and only the MOF-CVD approach \n\nis completely based on vapor-based techniques. The second category focuses on the layer-by-layer \n\nALD/MLD deposition of MOFs by use of organometallic and organic linker precursors. First trials \n\nof MOF-ALD/MLD by Salmi et al., used zinc acetate (ZnAc2) and 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid \n\n(terephthalic acid)  to form MOF\u2013537 thin films or ZnAc2 and 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid to form \n\nIRMOF-838 thin films. In both cases non-porous, amorphous films were deposited and could be \n\ncrystallized as a porous MOF by a subsequent two-step treatment. In case of the MOF-5 thin film, the \n\ncrystallization of a non-porous structure was firstly achieved in moist air for 72 h under 60% humidity, \n\nfollowed by a second, solvothermal treatment with dimethylformamide (DMF) at 150 \u00b0C for 60 min \n\nin an autoclave to obtain a porous MOF-5. Unfortunately, film continuity got lost during \n\ncrystallization as shown by SEM and a surface roughening was observed. The match with MOF-5 was \n\ndemonstrated by XRD and FTIR. The XRD diffractogram showed a high intensity 2? reflection at \n\n9.8\u00b0, typical for the MOF-5 (220) planes of the large unit cell shown in Figure 11. FTIR spectra \n\nshowed characteristic bands for the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of COO- \n\ncoordinating the zinc nodes.39  \n \n\n \n\nFigure 11: Structure of MOF-5 showing the cubic crystallographic cell. The octahedral inorganic Zn4O13 units \n(left) are located at the corner of the cell (nodes) while the organic terephthalate units (right) act as linkers \n\n(spacers). The large sphere marked in yellow highlights the cavity inside the structure. (Zn: violet spheres; O: \n\nred spheres; C: green spheres; H grey spheres.). Taken from Civalleri et al.49 \n\nOrganic \n\nterephthalate  \n\nlinker \n\nInorganic \n\nZn4O13 nodes \n\n\n\n \n\nREVIEW 15 \n\nIn the following, a closer look is given to the Nature Materials paper of Stassen et al.,30 in which thin \n\nfilms of ZIF-8 (zeolitic imidazolate framework) were synthesized as depicted in Figure 12. Complete \n\ntransformation of an ALD deposited, sub-10 nm sacrificial ZnO film into a uniform MOF film by a 17 \n\ntimes thickness expansion is reported when exposed to gaseous 2-methylimidazole (HMIM). \n\nCrystallinity of the ZIF-8 film was confirmed by XRD and homogeneous composition throughout the \n\nwhole film was proven by TOF-SIMS. The surface roughness determined by AFM was shown to be \n\nmuch smoother compared to similar films synthesized by solvothermal methods. The characteristic, \n\npermanent porosity of MOFs was demonstrated by gas adsorption isotherms. Furthermore, the high \n\nconformity of the initially deposited ZnO film enabled equally conformal ZIF-8 coatings even on \n\ncomplex nanopillar structures as shown in Figure 13. The formed water in the vapor-solid conversion \n\nof the ZnO to ZIF-8 is assumed to play a major role as a mobility-enhancing liquid. As confirmed by \n\nreal-time XRD monitoring the crystallization rate decreased when water was extracted by a dry N2 \n\ngas flow compared to an increased crystallization rate when a humid N2 flow was used. Also the \n\nincrease of conversion temperature from 115 \u00b0C to 130 \u00b0C had a significant influence on the \n\ntransformation rate due to faster neutralization reaction kinetics.  The exceptional thermal and \n\nchemical stability of ZIF-8 has to be highlighted.14, 22 Furthermore, additive lithography (lift-off \n\npatterning) using a photoresist was demonstrated. As no solvents were involved there was no risk of \n\nphotoresist distortion, dissolution or danger of collapsing the fragile pillar arrays. This proves the \n\napplicability of vapor-based methods for industrial nanofabrication standards and leaves solution based \n\nmethods behind. In summary, the work of Stassen et al., can be seen as a milestone in MOF-CVD \n\nsynthesis for device integration of the prototypic, microporous and crystalline ZIF-8 structure. \n\n \n\nFigure 12: Chemical vapor deposition of ZIF-8 thin films. The procedure consists of a metal oxide vapor \n\ndeposition (Step 1) and a consecutive vapor\u2013solid reaction (Step 2). Metal, oxygen and ligand sources are \n\nlabelled as M, O and L, respectively. Metal oxide deposition can be achieved by ALD (M, diethylzinc; O, \n\noxygen/water) or by reactive sputtering (M, zinc; O, oxygen plasma). Atom colours: zinc (grey) oxygen (red), \n\nnitrogen (light blue) and carbon (dark blue); hydrogen atoms are omitted.

Taken from Stassen et al.30 \n \n\nAdditionally and in particular, the work of Ahvenniemi and Karppinen36 has to be highlighted as it \n\nreports for the first time a direct MOF build-up in a ALD/MLD layer-by-layer manner in contrast to \n\nthe two-step approach of Stassen et al., Crystalline Cu(II)terephthalate (Cu-TP) thin films with \n\ncharacteristic paddlewheel structure as shown in Figure 14 were formed bottom-up in a narrow \n\ndeposition window of 180 \u2013 190  \u00b0C under vacuum conditions at 0.2 kPa.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 14:  ALD/MLD produced MOF-2 type paddlewheel structure associated to Cu(II)terephthalate MOFs: \n\nR corresponds to the terephthalate linkers and L is a coordination site. Taken from Ahvenniemi and Karppinen.36 \n\n \n\nA linear ALD/MLD process with constant GPC and saturative surface reactions are reported for the \n\nused precursor pulse lengths as short as 5 to 10 s. As precursors the organometallic complex \n\nCu bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionate) or short Cu(TMHD)2 and terephthalic acid (TPA) \n\nwere used. Crystallinity of the Cu-TP films was confirmed by GIXRD. The porous MOF-2 structures \n\nshowed also a moisture absorption behaviour when exposed to humid conditions for several days. This \n\n\n\n \n\nREVIEW 17 \n\nprocess was shown to be reversible upon heating to 200 \u00b0C for 2 days. Lattice expansion during water \n\nuptake could be imaged by a 2? peak shift to lower values and a peak broadening due to inhomogeneous \n\nH2O distribution. In addition to Cu-TP36, also crystalline Ca-TP50, crystalline Li-TP51 and amorphous \n\nEu-TP52 hybrid films were reported by Karppinen et al., showing the versatility of this ALD/MLD \n\napproach. In particular interesting, the Eu-TP thin film yielded a red luminescence under UV \n\nirradiation and an antenna effect of the organic ligand. Very recent works of Mai et al., (2017) \n\ndemonstrate an ALD/MLD route using an organometallic Er guanidinate precursor in combination \n\nwith the organic 3,5-pyridine dicarboxylic acid, where the organic ligand is an optimized luminescence \n\nsensitizer.53 By use of other vapor-based methods, thin films of luminescent lanthanide containing \n\nimidazolate networks were also reported in two publications54, 55 by M\u00fcller-Buschbaum and co-\n\nworkers both in a CVD aided process and a PVD route enhanced by Pulsed Laser Depositon (PLD). \n\n \n\nIn conclusion, the potentials and challenges of the recently grown research of vapor-synthesized \n\nMOFs are the following. It has been discussed that traditional MOF synthesis processes are based on \n\npowder preparation and wet chemical solvothermal routes that are incompatible with the demands of \n\nthe microelectronics industry. Issues are chemical contamination, corrosion and insufficient size \n\ncontrol down to the nanoscale. Furthermore, producibility and cost concerns inhibited the \n\nimplementation into electronic devices. As a consequence new synthesis routes are demanded and \n\nvapor phase based deposition processes are seen as the answer. The advances in the deposition of \n\norganic moieties in the last decade open up the possibility to produce MOFs in a cleaner, precise way \n\nin order to fulfil industrial requirements for quality, scalability, cost and nanofabrication standards. By \n\nuse of several precursors and the sequential, self-terminating character of ALD/MLD processes multi-\n\nlayered MOF structures with tuneable properties can be created. Vapor deposition also offers the \n\nopportunity to conduct post-synthetic vapor-solid modification on existing MOFs35. Moreover, CVD \n\nwith organometallic precursors was also used to load open framework structures with nanoclusters, \n\nfor instance by use of DEZ in order to form a ZnO@MOF-5 nanocomposite.39  Luminescent hybrids \n\nand LnMOF were identified as a highly interesting class which have already been synthesized \n\ninvolving vapor-based methods. Because of the complex chemistry of MOF crystallization many \n\nchallenges can be identified for the development of vapor deposition techniques. Nevertheless, first \n\npromising synthesis routes were reviewed in this chapter. Further in-depth research should focus on \n\nthe understanding of growth mechanisms and the optimization of film quality parameters. A high \n\ncrystal quality must be achieved without an increase in surface roughness and loss of film continuity \n\nas it has been reported in several multi-step methods that needed a post-crystallization treatment.  \n\nMoreover, precise film thickness, grain boundary and porosity control has to be reached. Finally, \n\ntechnological aspects like the development of ALD/MLD reactors have to be addressed. Reactors must \n\nbe designed for the smooth transport of organic precursors from the evaporation source until the \n\nsample surface. Scalability and large-area uniformity have to be guaranteed by the deposition device.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCHARACTERIZATION METHODS 19 \n\n6 Characterization Methods \n\nIn this work a wide range of characterization methods (SEM, EDX, STEM, AFM, GIXRD, XRR, \n\nFTIR, Raman, UV-Vis, TGA) was used to analyze the fabricated thin films. Thus, these techniques \n\ndeserve a few words in this document. The main literature sources are given at the beginning of each \n\nchapter.  \n\n6.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Scanning Transmission \nElectron Microscopy (STEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray \n\nspectroscopy (EDX) \n\nScanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) applies a focused electron beam to scan the surface of a sample. \n\nThe interactions of the electrons with the sample allow for imaging its topography or analysing its \n\ncomposition.  A summary of the interaction signal that can be used for analysis is shown in Figure 15. \n\nFor a comprehensive understanding of electron microscopy the reader is referred to the books of \n\nGoodhew, Humphreys and Beanland56 or Hawkes and Spence57, which were the sources for this \n\nchapter. \n\nThe setup of a SEM includes the components and function principles described in the following. \n\nConventionally, the whole setup is in vacuum to avoid interaction of electrons with gas molecules. An \n\nelectron source emits free electrons by thermionic emission in a tungsten filament, a lanthanum \n\nhexaboride cold cathode or by a field emission gun (FEG). FEGs are increasingly being used for high \n\nresolution imaging due to brilliant electron beams with small diameters in the range of 1 to 10 nm. \n\nThen, high voltage in the range of typically 1 to 30 kilovolts accelerates the electrons towards the \n\nsample. Inductive coils act as electromagnetic lenses and focus and deflect the electron beam in order \n\nto scan the sample surface line by line. The interaction of the electron probe with the sample includes \n\nfor instance creation of secondary electrons (SE) and backscattered electrons (BSE) which can be \n\ncaptured by suitable detectors.  \n\n  \n\nFigure 15: Interaction of electrons with the sample surface and signals that can be used for imaging (left). \n\nInteraction volume and typical depths from which SE, BSE and X-rays can be detected (right). Taken from \n\nGoodhew, Humphreys and Beanland.56  \n\n\n\n \n\nCHARACTERIZATION METHODS 20 \n\nSE with energies in the range of several eV are created by the primary electrons in the sample surface \n\nwithin a depth of a few nanometers. They can be detected by an Everhart-Thornley detector, which is \n\nplaced aside of the sample or an InLense detector, which is placed above the sample in an annular \n\nmanner around the electron beam axis. SE images mainly exhibit a topographical contrast of the \n\nsurface morphology as the SE extraction depends on the incident angle and diameter of the electron \n\nbeam. Due to the so-called edge effect more SE can leave the sample at edges and lead to an increased \n\nbrightness in these areas as shown in Figure 16. Pictures with high depth of field and plastic \n\nappearance can be produced. Moreover, but to a lesser extent the extraction of electrons is dependent \n\non the atomic number, chemical bondings and charging effects leading to a material contrast. Images \n\nwith increased material contrast can be obtained by use of the signal of the BSE with energies in the \n\nrange of keV. This is based on the fact that heavy elements backscatter more than light elements and \n\nappear brighter in the image.  \n\n \n\nFigure 16: On a flat surface perpendicular to the electron beam many secondary electrons can leave the sample \n\nsurface at edges and lead to a brighter image in these areas compared to a flat surface perpendicular to the \n\nelectron beam. Taken from the \u201cElectron Microscopy Site\u201d of ETH Z\u00fcrich.A  \n\n \n\nElectrical conductivity is a requirement for SEM samples in order to avoid an electrical charging. \n\nSample charging can lead to sample movement due to electrostatic interaction with the electron beam. \n\nImaging of isolating samples can be enabled by coating with a conductive layer. For this purpose \n\nsputter deposition of gold or a carbon coating by means of a carbon evaporator are commonly used. \n\nBesides the imaging function most of the commercial SEMs nowadays have also the possibility for \n\nchemical microanalysis by means of electron dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX or EDS) or Auger \n\nelectron analysis (AES). The electrons from the incident beam excite and eject electrons from the inner \n\nshells of the sample atoms into higher energetic states. This process leaves a \u201chole\u201d behind, which can \n\nbe filled by an electron coming from an outer, higher energetic shell under emission of characteristic \n\nX-rays. Alternatively, the hole can be filled by an electron from an upper shell under simultaneous \n\n                                                      \nA Image source: http://www.microscopy.ethz.ch/images/edge.jpg, access 26/05/2017 \n\n\n\n \n\nCHARACTERIZATION METHODS 21 \n\nemission of another, so-called Auger electron. Due to the distinct, characteristic electronic structure \n\nof each element these electron transition processes are material dependent and therefore can be used \n\nfor compositional analysis of a sample. \n\nScanning Transmission Electron Microscopy uses a scanning electron beam like SEM and many \n\ninstrumental aspects in STEM are similar to SEM. This is in contrast to the static electron beam in \n\nconventional TEM. However, the signal of the electrons transmitted through the sample is used for \n\nimaging as shown in Figure 15. Considerably higher acceleration voltages of usually 100 to 300 kV \n\nare being used to let the electrons pass a sufficiently thin specimen.  The precondition for samples with \n\nthicknesses typically below 100 nm arises from the fact that electrons get elastically and inelastically \n\nscattered at the sample atoms. Therefore advanced and often complicated sample preparation methods \n\nare afforded to achieve suitable specimens. For instance, milling by means of a focused ion beam (FIB) \n\nor electro polishing are used for preparing thin sample slices. Nanostructured materials (nanoparticles, \n\nnanowires etc.) often allow an easier preparation by bringing them into suspension and placing them \n\nonto special TEM grids. \n\nThere exist two operation modes for TEM, which define the contrast mechanisms for imaging and \n\ncontent of information that can be obtained: bright-field mode and dark-field mode. In the bright field \n\nor transmission mode the unscattered beam is detected by a centered aperture in the optical axis for \n\nsample imaging. Contrast arises from differences in sample thickness and density. Thick and dense \n\nparts appear darker in the image as they inhibit electrons to pass through. In well oriented crystalline \n\nsamples atomic columns can be imaged and fringes from the lattice planes get visible. Furthermore, a \n\ndiffraction contrast appears as electron scattering in particular crystal orientations is greatly increased \n\nso that scattered electrons will not be detected in the optical axis. Moreover, crystal defects can be \n\ndetected due to this diffraction contrast and, additionally, a compositional contrast arises from the Z-\n\ndependent inelastic scattering of electrons. The second TEM operation mode is the dark-field mode. \n\nThe internal structure of thin samples can be revealed due to the aforementioned scattering of \n\nelectrons. In the dark-field the aperture is placed aside from the optical axis in order to catch the \n\ndiffracted electrons. Diffraction patterns can be observed in order to study the crystal structure.  \n\nA speciality of STEM compared to conventional TEM with a fixed electron beam is the possibility of \n\nspectroscopic mapping. Compositional analysis by EDX or electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) \n\ncan be correlated to the imaging data. Furthermore, Z contrasts can be imaged effectively by use of \n\nhigh-angle annular dark field detectors (HAADF). Modern spherical aberration corrected STEMs use \n\ncomputer controlled lenses to achieve probe sizes&lt;0.1nm and allow analysis on the subatomic level. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nCHARACTERIZATION METHODS 22 \n\n6.2 Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) \n\nThis chapter is fully based on the extensive book of Voigtl\u00e4nder about Scanning Probe Microscopy.58 \n\nAtomic force microscopy (AFM) is a type of scanning probe microscopy with nanoscale resolution, in \n\nwhich a nanometer sharp probe tip scans the sample surface and detects the interaction forces with a \n\nspecimen. Piezoelectric elements are used for precise movement of the tip, which is placed on a flexible, \n\nmicrometer long cantilever. By interaction with the surface atoms of the specimen the cantilever is \n\nbent due to the vertical movement of the tip. This bending can be detected by several methods. For \n\ninstance, the deflection of a laser beam that is reflected from the back of the cantilever can reveal the \n\nvertical movement and therefore information about the surface topography (Figure 17).  \n\nThere exist mainly three different operation modes in AFM: Contact mode (1), tapping mode (2) and \n\nnon-contact mode (3). In the contact mode the tip is in constant contact with the sample surface. \n\nSignals can be obtained either in constant height of the cantilever by measuring varying forces or \n\nmeasuring the varying height at a constant force. This process is controlled by electronic feedback \n\nloops for instance with proportional-integral controllers.  In the tapping mode an oscillation of the tip \n\nis externally excited with a constant frequency near the resonance frequency of the cantilever. An \n\nintermittent sample contact of the tip changes the oscillation amplitude due to interaction with the \n\nsample. In non-contact mode the measured signal arises from resonance frequency modulation or \n\namplitude modulation due to the interaction with the sample surface. The last two modes have the \n\nadvantage that a constant mechanical contact with the sample is avoided and, thus, the risk of tip \n\nsticking and tip damage. Moreover, non-contact and tapping mode are preferred for the analysis of \n\nsoft samples. \n\n \n\nFigure 17: Schematics of atomic force microscopy operation. Taken from Voigtl\u00e4nder.58 \n\n\n\n \n\nCHARACTERIZATION METHODS 23 \n\n6.3 X-Ray Reflectometry (XRR) \n\nThis chapter is based on the technical review of Yasaka which gives a brief and comprehensible \n\nintroduction for new users of X-ray reflectometry (XRR)59. More detailed descriptions and derivations \n\nof the physical principles can be found in the book of Fewster.60 Early studies were done by Kiessig61 \n\n(1931) and Parratt62 (1954).  \n\nXRR is a non-destructive technique used for thin film analysis. Parameters like the film thickness, \n\ndensity and surface and interface roughness of single- or multilayer structures on flat substrates can \n\nbe determined. Thin films with thickness of around 3 \u2013to 300 nm and roughness up to 3 nm can be \n\nmeasured with a precision of 0.1 to 0.3 nm.63 This technique is not based on diffraction phenomena and \n\nthe analyzed material can be single crystalline, polycrystalline or amorphous.63 In Figure 18 a typical \n\nXRR curve is given with designation of the information that it can provide. From the critical angle \n\nthe density of the thin film material can be derived. The film thickness information is included in the \n\noscillation of the Kiessig fringes61 and the amplitude reveals the density contrast between substrate \n\nand thin film. Surface and interface roughness can be deduced by the oscillation and intensity decay at \n\nhigher angles. \n\n \n\nFigure 18: Exemplary XRR reflection intensity curve and summary \n\nof the provided information of its profile. Taken from Yasaka.59 \n\n \n\nFigure 19: Reflection and refraction of X-rays at \n\nmaterial surface with changes in the grazing angle \n\nof the incident beam. Taken from Yasaka.59 \n\n \n\nImportantly, a difference in refractive index (difference in electron density) between thin film and \n\nsubstrate material is required. The complex refractive index n of a material for the special case of \n\nmonochromatic X-rays is smaller than one and can be described by formula (1).64 \n\n\n\n \n\nCHARACTERIZATION METHODS 24 \n\n? = 1 ? ? ? ?? (1) \n\nHere ? is the dispersion and ? is the absorption of the medium with magnitudes of ? ? 10-5 and      \n\n? ? 10-6 for X-rays with wavelengths around 1 \u00c5. For the measurement an incident X-ray beam with \n\na glancing angle of typically 0\u00b0 to 5\u00b0 is used. For incident angles smaller than the critical angle ?c the \n\nX-ray beam is totally reflected as illustrated in Figure 19. This critical angle is material dependent \n\nand a function of the electron concentration and layer density. For angles larger than the critical angle \n\nthe X-ray beam penetrates the thin film. For the assumption of neglected absorption the \n\ncritical angle ?c can be determined from the dispersion in equation (2). \n\n?? ? ?2? (2) \n\nThe dispersion ? in this formula is dependent on the classical electron radius re, the wavelength of the \n\nincident X-ray, the Avogadro number NA, the material density ?, and the molar fractions xi, atomic \n\nnumbers Zi and the molecular weight Mi of species i as presented in equation (3). \n\n? = (\n?? ?\n\n2\n\n2?\n) ? ??? ?\n\n? ?? ???\n? ?? ???\n\n \n(3) \n\nThus, by combining formulas (2) and (3) the material density is obtained just by measuring the critical \n\nangle ?c for total reflection.

The wavelength ? of the \n\nincident X-ray beam is considered. As described by Fewster60 an approximative formula for the film \n\nthickness of a single layer can be derived by using the Bragg\u2019s equation combined with the Snell\u2019s rule \n\nand is given in formula (5).

The reader is referred to the \n\nclassical literature about crystallography and X-ray diffraction like the book of Hammond58 or the \n\nintroduction to X-ray physics of Als-Nielsen57. \n\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) is a non-destructive technique for the structural analysis of crystalline \n\nmaterials. Incident X-rays penetrate the sample and get scattered at the sample atoms into all \n\n\n\n \n\nCHARACTERIZATION METHODS 25 \n\ndirections. In the case of a crystal, diffraction occurs due to the periodic arrangement of the sample \n\natoms. Considering the wave nature of X-rays, this means that high intensities of the diffracted beam \n\ncan be detected at specific exit angles where constructive interference of electromagnetic radiation \n\noccurs. At these distinct angles the Bragg condition in equation (6) is fulfilled.   \n\n?? = 2???? ? sin (???? ) (6) \n\nHerein n is a positive integer, ? is the wavelength of the incident X-rays,  dhkl is the interplanar lattice \n\ndistance of a family of crystal planes (hkl) and ?hkl is the corresponding Bragg angle. The Miller indices \n\nh, k , l are used. In a typical diffractogram the intensity of the diffracted beam is commonly plotted over \n\nthe angle 2?. The appearance of a diffraction pattern with characteristic Bragg peaks is specific for a \n\ncertain crystal structure. Due to the concept of reciprocal space, Bragg peaks at low 2? angles \n\ncorrespond to large crystal lattice parameters and Bragg peaks at large 2? angles to small lattice \n\nparameters.  \n\nGrazing Incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) is a special type of XRD for analysing the crystalline \n\nstructure of thin films and nanostructures. X-rays under grazing incidence are used to enhance the \n\nsurface sensitivity in order to accentuate the thin film signal compared to the substrate signal.  \n\nExperimentally, mostly an asymmetric measurement setup as shown in Figure 20 is chosen in contrast \n\nto the symmetric Bragg-Brentano geometry that is conventionally used for structural analysis of bulk \n\nmaterials in powder diffraction. This means, that the incident angle of primary X-rays in GIXRD is \n\nfixed and the diffracted beams are by a moveable detector. Soller slits on the detector side are used for \n\ncollimation. For further reading about structural analysis of thin films and chapters about GIXRD it \n\nis referred to the literature.63, 65 \n\n \n\nFigure 20: GIXRD measurement setup: Principle of X-ray diffraction in grazing incidence. 1, 2, 3 and 4 \n\ndesignate grains with different orientations in a polycrystalline thin film (left).

Illustrations \n\ntaken from Spiess.63 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nCHARACTERIZATION METHODS 26 \n\n6.5 Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) \n\nThis brief overview is based on the review of Coats and Redfern.66 \n\nIn a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) the weight, or differential weight change respectively, of a \n\nsample is measured as a function of temperature which is linearly increased over time. Often the \n\nrelative weight with regard to the initial weight in percent is used. For the measurement the sample \n\nis placed on a microbalance in a heatable analysis chamber. Inside this oven a temperature profile can \n\nbe programmed and is controlled by a thermoelement. A purging gas can be used to simulate different \n\natmospheres. The weight changes of the sample at characteristic temperatures are a sign for chemical \n\nor physical processes like evaporation, sublimation, adsorption and desorption processes, \n\ndecomposition or oxidation or reduction reactions. Thus, conclusions about the sample composition \n\ncan be drawn. With regard to the analysis of ALD/MLD precursors TGA can help to choose the \n\ntemperature to which the canisters have to be heated for precursor evaporation.  \n\n \n\n6.6 Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) \n\nThe following is based on the chapter about infrared (IR) spectroscopy in the book of Yadav.67 \n\nIn IR spectroscopy the interaction (absorption, transmission or reflectance) of radiation in the infrared \n\n(IR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum with a solid, liquid or gaseous sample is observed. \n\nAbsorption of IR radiation leads to quantized vibrational or rotational energy changes in the analyzed \n\nsubstance. Figure 21 shows an example for two types of stretching vibrations. Consequently, IR \n\nspectra are often referred as vibrational-rotational spectra. The energy transfer leading to these \n\nexcited molecular modes creates absorption bands in the corresponding spectra. Absorption bands \n\nappear in characteristic ranges and are therefore specific for bonding types or functional groups. \n\nTherefore IR spectroscopy is widely used for structural analysis and for identification of compounds. \n\nFor further reading the reader is referred to the literature like the book of Nakamoto68 which presents \n\nan extensive work about spectroscopy of inorganic and coordination compounds, while Yadav67 gives \n\na brief introduction for spectroscopy of organic compounds.  \n\n \n\nFigure 21: Excitation of symmetrical and asymmetrical stretching vibrations of covalent bonds by absorption \n\nof a characteristic frequency ?s or ?as.  \n\n?s ?as \n\n\n\n \n\nCHARACTERIZATION METHODS 27 \n\nIn an IR spectrum typically the absorbance or transmittance of IR light is plotted on the vertical axis. \n\nOn the horizontal axis an energy equivalent of the spectral range is represented, which can be the \n\nwavelength in \u00b5m, frequency in s-1 or most commonly the wavenumber in cm-1. Usually a spectral \n\nrange in the ordinary infrared from around 4000 to 667 cm-1 is investigated. The region below 1500 \n\ncm-1 is called fingerprint region in which compounds are identified due to their unique absorption \n\npattern. While conventional, dispersive IR spectrometers obtain the spectrum by successive variation \n\nof a narrow wavelength range, modern Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometers use \n\nMichelson-interferometers and can deliver high resolution by recording a wide spectral range at once. \n\nInterferograms are instantly converted into spectra by Fourier transformation. This fast and precise \n\ndata acquisition is the reason why mostly FTIR spectrometers are used nowadays. The sample \n\npreparation depends on the aggregate state of the specimen. Solid powders can be mixed and pestled \n\ntogether with a dry KBr powder. The mixture is then pressed into a transparent pellet with a special \n\ndye. Alternatively, thin films can be deposited on bare KBr discs. KBr shows no absorption in the IR \n\nspectrum and therefore does not influence the measurement result of the analyte. \n\n \n\n6.7 Raman spectroscopy \n\nLikewise the previous paragraph the following is based on the book of Yadav.67 \n\nRaman spectroscopy is another technique dealing with transitions in vibrational and rotational energy \n\nlevels of molecules upon absorption of electromagnetic radiation. Thus, it has a close relation to IR \n\nspectroscopy. However, different methods of excitation are used and the absorption mechanisms are \n\nbased on different spectroscopic selection rules. While IR absorption bands indicate change in dipole \n\nmoments of bonds, Raman intensity signifies a change in polarizability of bonds. Consequently, \n\nelectrically symmetrical bonds are without dipole moment do not absorb in the IR region (IR inactive), \n\nbut do absorb in Raman spectroscopy (Raman active). Therefore, IR and Raman spectroscopy are \n\ncomplementary techniques. In Raman spectroscopy typically a laser is used as monochromatic \n\nirradiation source with wavelength in the near UV, visible or near IR region of the electromagnetic \n\nspectrum. The laser light is scattered when it passes a transparent sample. The scattering process can \n\nbe either elastic (Rayleigh scattering) or inelastic. The inelastically scattered light has a characteristic \n\nwavelength shift. The scattered light can be either shifted to lower wavelengths by an energy loss \n\n(Stokes scattering) or to higher wavelengths by an energy uptake (Anti-Stokes). The Stokes and Anti-\n\nStokes lines are symmetrically displaced in wavenumbers around the parental Rayleigh line. However, \n\nthe Stokes transition is more probable than the Anti-Stokes and, thus, Stokes lines have higher \n\nintensity than the Anti-Stokes lines. Therefore, only the Stokes side is usually presented in Raman \n\nspectra in which the Raman intensity is typically plotted versus the wavenumber. Raman shifts appear \n\nin the IR region from about 100 to 3000 cm-1. Complementary to IR spectroscopy these characteristic \n\nshifts can be used for identification of organic compounds as a fingerprint. \n\n\n\n \n\nCHARACTERIZATION METHODS 28 \n\n6.8 Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) \n\nThis paragraph is mainly based on the respective chapter about UV-Vis spectroscopy in the book of \n\nYadav.67 For the part concerning Tauc-gaps the reader is also referred to the book of Stenzel about \n\n\u201cThe Physics of Thin Film Optical Spectra\u201d.69 \n\nUltraviolet-visible spectrophotometry (UV-Vis) analyzes the absorption, transmission or reflectance \n\nof electromagnetic radiation in the ultraviolet spectrum with wavelengths from about 10 to 400 nm \n\nand visible spectrum with wavelengths from about 400 to 800 nm. In these regions characteristic \n\nexcitations of valence electrons take place. UV-Vis spectroscopy is therefore a standard \n\ncharacterization method in organic chemistry for analysis of electronic transitions from lower to \n\nhigher molecular orbitals and can be used to detect conjugated multiple bonds. In the field of \n\nsemiconductors UV-Vis is also applied to characterize the optical properties of thin films on wafers \n\nand determine optical bandgaps.69 \n\nA spectrophotometer measures the intensity of light before and after passing the sample in order to \n\nobtain the relative transmittance. Transparent liquids in cuvettes can be measured like that. Solids can \n\nbe measured in diffuse reflectance where the reflected intensity of a powder for instance is compared \n\nto the reflected intensity of an ideally reflecting reference material, such as a white tile made from \n\nBaSO4. Often spectrophotometers are double beam systems for the purpose of the reference \n\nmeasurement. As light sources often a deuterium arc lamp is used to cover the UV region and a halogen \n\nlamp for example can be used to cover the visible spectrum. Monochromators with diffraction gratings \n\nallow for stepwise selection of the wavelength to scan through the spectrum. Photomultiplier tubes or \n\nphotodiodes detect the transmitted or reflected light. \n\nUV-Vis spectroscopy can be used for the determination of semiconductor bandgaps as electrons absorb \n\na characteristic energy h? when excited from the valence to the conduction band. It is referred to the \n\ntechnical instruction of Shimadzu about the \u201cmeasurements of band gap in compound \n\nsemiconductors\u201d.B Originally deduced by Tauc for amorphous semiconductors the following \n\nequation (7) is valid.69-71 \n\n(???)1/? = ?(?? ? ??) \n(7) \n\nHere ? is the optical absorption coefficient, A is a constant, h? is the photon energy, h is Planck\u2019s \n\nconstant, ? is the frequency, Eg is the optical bandgap and n is \u00bd for a direct band gap semiconductor. \n\nIn case of acquiring the UV-Vis spectrum in diffuse reflectance mode, commonly Kubelka-Munk units \n\nare used to convert the measured reflectivity R? into an absorption signal. This can be realized by use \n\n                                                      \nB Shimadzu Corporation, Application News, No. A428, Measurements of Band Gap in Compound Semiconductors \u2013 Band Gap \n\nDetermination from Diffuse Reflectance Spectra \n\n\n\n \n\nCHARACTERIZATION METHODS 29 \n\nof the Kubelka-Munk function F(R?) shown in equation (8), that is proportional to the absorption \n\ncoefficient ?.

ALD synthesis of ZnO thin films was \n\nperformed including their exposure with HMIM aiming at a vapor-solid transformation into a ZIF-8 \n\nMOF. Furthermore, ALD/MLD experiments for direct gas-phase deposition of a ZIF-8 MOF and \n\ndeposition of terephthalate hybrid films are described. In the experimental details, where literature \n\nresults are attempted to reproduce, the choice of parameters is compared and justified with the former \n\nworks. \n\n \n\n7.1 Description of the ALD reactor \n\nThe reactor used for thin film deposition in this work is a non-commercial, home-built cross-flow \n\nreactor, as shown in Figure 22. Therefore the system can be easily modified and adapted to the \n\nrequirements of a specific ALD/MLD process. Three reservoirs (e.g. stainless steel canisters as shown \n\nin Figure 23) can potentially enable the sequential use of up to three precursors. The samples are \n\nplaced in the heatable reactor chamber, in which the precursors are injected with a programmable \n\nsequence order for deposition at controlled temperature. N2 serves as the carrier gas for the precursors \n\nand the flow can be adjusted with a mass flow controller. In the purging steps N2 flow and dry scroll \n\npump are used for evacuation of the reactor chamber. Heating mats around the gas tubing are used for \n\nelevated temperatures throughout the whole system. The temperature is controlled by various \n\nthermocouples in the reactor chamber, at the gas lines and the evaporation sources. Main features of \n\nthe system are a deposition temperature up to about 450 \u00b0C, theoretically possible by the heating \n\nelements, and an evacuation base pressure down to 4.4 \u00d7 10-1 Torr. High speed pneumatic valves for \n\nprecursor injection allow pulsing times in the range of milliseconds. \n\n\n\n \n\nEXPERIMENTAL 32 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 22: ALD reactor with designation of the main \n\ncomponents.

The refilling of these \n\ncanisters is performed inside a glovebox. \n\nIn general the ALD system has to guarantee the three main steps (1) evaporation of precursor, (2) \n\ntransport of gaseous precursor into the reaction chamber, and (3) deposition on solid sample surface. \n\nThe sequential ALD cycle (precursor A injection/inert gas purge/precursor B injection/inert gas \n\npurge) is described for the classical example of ZnO deposition by means of the reactor scheme in \n\nFigure 24. Sequential injection of water (H2O) and diethylzinc (DEZ) with intermediate purging steps \n\nis performed. The HMIM canister is neglected in this process. One ALD cycle is exemplarily described \n\nin the following: \n\n1) V2 open, V1/V3/V4 closed \n\n? DEZ pulse and residence time \n\n2) V4 open, V1/V2/V3 closed \n\n?

N2 gas is used as carrier gas to transport gaseous \n\nprecursors into the reactor chamber where the sample is placed. N2 has also the role of the purging gas after each \n\nprecursor pulsing, in order to remove the surface reaction by-products and unreacted precursors. The high speed \n\npneumatic valves V1, V2 and V3 can be opened and closed independently for sequential precursor injection. The \n\ntemperature control in the reactor chamber and in the stainless steel tubes is guaranteed by heating mats around \n\nthe gas tubing and by various thermocouples. A Pirani gauge is used for pressure monitoring. A dry scroll pump \n\nevacuates and cleans the chamber from excess precursors in the purging steps. A trap with a zeolite filter protects \n\nthe vacuum pump from accumulation of excess precursors or by-products. \n\n \n\nIn the current state of the ALD system the temperature control with the applied heating mats is not \n\noptimal for long run depositions at elevated temperatures. In an introduced system modification \n\nheating mats are replaced step-by-step by heating jackets with integrated thermocouples to ensure a \n\nmore uniform heating and temperature control in the gas tubing. This upgrade, enables the system to \n\nbe more user friendly for removing and further refilling the precursor canisters in a glovebox. \n\n \n\n7.2 Used precursors and their thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) \n\nPrecursors have to be well chosen in terms of volatility, thermal stability and reactivity. They can be \n\nsolid or liquid and have to be evaporated for vapor deposition. By simple thermal heating the vapor \n\npressure is increased. In Table 2 the here used precursors are listed. The precursors were stored in a \n\nglovebox under inert atmosphere to avoid any contamination or chemical modification. This means \n\nthat the precursor canisters have to be refilled inside the glovebox. For the solid powder precursors \n\nthis has the advantage that moisture adsorption can be prevented and the flowability of the powder \n\nparticles is guaranteed for an easy refilling process. \n\nAll of the precursors have been reported for use in ALD or MLD before. For ZnO deposition the \n\nconventional precursor pair diethylzinc (DEZ; Sigma-Aldrich) as Zn source and milli-Q H2O as \n\n\n\n \n\nEXPERIMENTAL 34 \n\noxygen source were chosen.72 DEZ is a liquid metal-organic compound and reacts with water. 2-\n\nmethylimidazole (HMIM; Sigma-Aldrich 99%) and terephthalic acid (TPA; Sigma-Aldrich 98%) are \n\norganic precursors that are common linker molecules in organic-inorganic hybrids or MOFs, \n\nrespectively. The terephthalate moiety is the organic linker of the aforementioned MOF-537 or other \n\nterephthalate hybrids reported by Karppinen36, 50-52 and the imidazole is part of the zeolitic imidazolate \n\nframework ZIF-8 reported by Stassen30. The volatile Cu(TMHD)2 and Eu(TMHD)3 chelates are  \n\ncommercially available metal sources for ALD processes (Strem Chemicals Inc.) and their synthesis \n\nwas reported elsewhere.73, 74 \n\nTable 2: List of precursors with their short names used or mentioned in this work. \n\nShort name Chemical name (trivial name) Appearance at RT Structure formula \n\nH2O water colorless liquid \n \n\nDEZ diethylzinc colorless liquid \n \n\nHMIM 2-methylimidazole white powder \n\n \n\nTPA \n1,4-benzodicarboxylic acid \n\n(terephthalic acid) \nwhite powder \n\n \n\nCu(TMHD)2 \nCu(II)-bis-(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-\n\nheptanedionate) \ndark blue powder \n\n \n\nEu(TMHD)3 \n\n \nEuropium(III)-tris-(2,2,6,6-\ntetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionate) \n \n\nyellow powder \n\n \n\n \n\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the solid precursors was performed in order to determine the \n\nonset of sublimation and thermal stability. This helps to define the experimental parameters in terms \n\nof temperature range for the ALD process avoiding premature precursor decomposition. For this \n\npurpose HMIM, TPA, Cu(TMHD)2 and Eu(TMHD)3 powders were analyzed in a SHIMADZU TGA-\n\n50 device. A temperature profile with 5 \u00b0C/min up to 400 \u00b0C was ramped. A N2 gas flow of 20 ml/min \n\nwas used in accordance to the fact that N2 would also be the carrier gas in the ALD/MLD process. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nEXPERIMENTAL 35 \n\n7.3 ALD of ZnO thin films \n\nZnO thin films with increasing number of ALD cycles (10, 25, 50, 100, 200) and, therefore, increasing \n\nthickness were deposited on 500 to 550 \u00b5m thick boron doped Si(100) wafers (Siegert Wafer GmbH, \n\nGermany) with dimension ? 1x1 cm\u00b2 in order to study the GPC. In order to verify the conformality \n\nof the ALD process, nitrogen-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (N-MWCNTs, in the following \n\ndenoted \u201cN-CNTs\u201d) forests were also coated. The N-CNTs were CVD-grown in-house in a quartz-\n\ntube furnace reactor, as reported elsewhere.75, 76  \n\nBefore deposition, the Si(100) substrates were cleaned in a Piranha solution with a 3:1 mixture of \n\nsulfuric acid (H2SO4) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), rinsed with distilled water and dry-blown with \n\ncompressed air. Piranha solution is a strong oxidizing agent used to clean substrates from organic \n\nresidues. Moreover, it allows terminating the substrate surface with OH-groups facilitating the initial \n\nsurface reaction for the subsequent ZnO deposition.77 A conventional ALD route based on the reaction \n\nof milli-Q H2O and diethylzinc Zn(C2H5)2 was used.72, 78, 79 In formula (10) the * marks the surface \n\nspecies. \n\n??(?2?5)2\n?\n\n+ ?2?

The precursors were \n\ntransported by a N2 carrier gas flow of 100 sccm through the gas delivery tubing, which was heated \n\nto 100 \u00b0C in order to avoid condensation. The reactor chamber was heated to a deposition temperature \n\nof 100 \u00b0C. The pulsing, residence and purging times for one ALD cycle are summarized in Table 3. \n\nLong residence times of the precursor in the chamber after injection were used to ensure a complete \n\nsurface reaction and long purging times were used to guarantee a full removal of unreacted precursors \n\nand that only one precursor at a time was present in the reactor chamber. \n\nTable 3: ALD sequence of pulsing and residence times, tpulse and tresidence, of the precursors H2O and DEZ used \n\nfor one cycle of ZnO deposition and separated by intermediate N2-purging steps. \n\nH2O injection N2 purge DEZ injection N2 purge \ntpulse / s tresidence / s tpurge / s tpulse / s tresidence / s tpurge / s \n\n0.2 10 20 0.1 10 25 \n\n \n\nThe ZnO thin films on Si(100) and N-CNTs were analyzed by SEM and EDX in a Hitachi FE-SEM \n\nSU-70 at 15 kV acceleration voltage equipped with a field emission gun.

Film thickness and density measurements by XRR and structural analysis by GIXRD were \n\ncarried out in a Philips X\u2019Pert MRD diffractometer (Cu K? @ 45 kV, 40 mA).

Firstly, the \n\ntransformation of a sacrificial ZnO film into ZIF-8 by a MOF-CVD process was conducted. Secondly, \n\na direct gas-phase process by MOF-MLD was studied. \n\n \n\n7.4.1 MOF-CVD of sacrificial ZnO films \n\nFollowing the strategy of a vapor-solid reaction and transformation of a ZnO thin film into a ZIF-8 \n\nMOF by Stassen et al.,30 a post-treatment with 2-methylimidazole (HMIM) was performed on ZnO \n\nsamples as processed in 7.2. ZnO films with 50 ALD cycles with a corresponding film thickness of \n\n18 nm were used, similar to the 15 nm ZnO films reported by Stassen. Different ZnO thin films were \n\nexposed to HMIM vapor at several temperatures (100 \u00b0C, 110 \u00b0C and 130 \u00b0C) with treatment processes \n\nas shown in Table 4. Several pulsing/purging sequences with different cycles and effective treatment \n\ndurations were tried. The HMIM canisters were kept at evaporation temperatures between 100 and \n\n110 \u00b0C, similar to be reported by Stassen. However, the HMIM injection had cycled character, in \n\ncontrast to the continuous vapor treatment of Stassen. The effective HMIM treatment duration was \n\nchosen to be at least 30 min as reported by Stassen. In a process shown in Table 5 the transformation \n\nreaction was extended to an even longer exposure duration at higher exposure temperature of 130 \u00b0C \n\nand under humid condition which was provided by additional pulsing of water. \n\nTable 4: List of experiments for HMIM exposure of ZnO films for vapor-solid reaction under dry conditions. \n\nTreatment \n\ntemperature \n\nCycles HMIM injection N2 purge Effective HMIM \n\nexposure time tpulse tresidence tpurge \n\n110 \u00b0C 50 2 s 40 s 40 s 35 min \n\n100 \u00b0C 30 5 s 60 s 1 s 33 min \n\n130 \u00b0C 30 5 s 60 s 1 s 33 min \n\n130 \u00b0C 150 2 s  15 s  30 s 43 min \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nEXPERIMENTAL 37 \n\nTable 5: HMIM exposure of ZnO films for vapor-solid reaction under humid conditions by additional H2O \n\ninjections. \n\nTreatment \ntemperature \nin \u00b0C \n\ncycles HMIM injection N2 purge H2O injection Effective  HMIM \nexposure time tpulse tresidence tpurge tpulse tresidence \n\n130 \u00b0C 400 2 s 10 s 2 s 1 s  5 s 80 min \n\n \n\nSamples were analyzed by SEM/EDX in a Hitachi FE-SEM SU-70 at 15 kV acceleration voltage and \n\nby Raman spectroscopy in a Bruker RFS-100/S (1064 nm laser, 400 mW) in a range from \n\n100 to 4000 cm-1 with the objective to detect the organic moiety. Structural analysis by GIXRD was \n\nperformed in a Philips X\u2019Pert MRD diffractometer (Cu K? @ 45 kV, 40 mA) in a 2? scan range from \n\n10\u00b0 to 80\u00b0. \n\n \n\n7.4.2 MOF-ALD/MLD by DEZ and HMIM \n\nVapor-phase deposition of ZIF-8 on Si(100) and N-CNTs by a direct ALD/MLD route using DEZ as \n\nZn source and HMIM as imidazolate linkers was studied. Deposition temperatures between 100 and \n\n130 \u00b0C were used. As shown in Table 6 different pulsing/residence/purging schemes and deposition \n\ncycles (200, 300, 400) were applied in order to create a MOF thin film from DEZ and HMIM. The \n\nHMIM canister temperature was kept between 100 and 110 \u00b0C. In another attempt the sequential use \n\nof three precursor sources DEZ, HMIM and H2O was applied as shown in Table 7. \n\nTable 6: ALD/MLD sequence using DEZ and HMIM aiming at formation of a ZIF-8 MOF. \n\nDEZ injection N2 purge HMIM injection N2 purge \ntpulse/s tresidence/s tpurge/s tpulse/s tresidence/s tpurge/s \n\n0.1 5 25 1-2 15 30 \n\n \n\nTable 7: ALD/MLD sequence using DEZ, HMIM and H2O as precursors. \n\nDEZ injection N2 purge HMIM injection N2 purge H2O injection N2 purge \ntpulse/s tresidence/s tpurge/s tpulse/s tresidence/s tpurge/s tpulse/s tresidence/s tpurge/s \n\n0.1 s  5 s 25 s 1-2 s 10-15 s 30 s 0.2 5 20 \n\n \n\nSamples were analyzed by SEM/EDX in a Hitachi FE-SEM SU-70 at 15 kV acceleration voltage. \n\nAdditionally, N-CNT samples were prepared by dry adhesion on a HC300-CU holey carbon film as a \n\nTEM grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, USA) for further analysis in a FE-STEM/SEM \n\nHitachi HD-2700. Raman spectroscopy in a Bruker RFS-100/S (1064 nm laser, 400 mW) in a range \n\nfrom 100 to 4000 cm-1 was performed for Si(100) substrates in order to detect if the organic moiety \n\nwas deposited. \n\n\n\n \n\nEXPERIMENTAL 38 \n\n7.5 Direct routes towards terephthalate hybrid thin films \n\nThe following attempts to the synthesis of hybrid thin films using terephthalic acid (TPA) as the \n\norganic moiety are based on the previous work of Karppinen et al. (references are given in the \n\nexperimental section).  \n\n7.5.1 ALD/MLD by DEZ and TPA \n\nThe precursors DEZ and TPA were sequentially injected into the reactor chamber from external \n\ncanisters. The DEZ canister was kept at room temperature (RT). The TPA canister temperature was \n\nfixed at 190 \u00b0C according to thermogravimetric analysis. This is in the same range of 180 \u00b0C36, 50, 185 \n\n\u00b0C51 and 212 \u00b0C52 used by Karppinen et al., for TPA sublimation. A N2 carrier gas flow of 100 sccm was \n\napplied. Depositions with 200, 300 and 400 cycles were performed and 150 \u00b0C, 175 \u00b0C and 200 \u00b0C were \n\ntested as deposition temperatures. The pulsing, residence and purging times for one ALD cycle are \n\nsummarized in Table 8. Again, long pulsing and residence times were chosen for a saturated surface \n\nreaction. Long purging times ensure the removal of residual precursor after each injection step. \n\nDeposition on several substrates like Si(100),  Si with around 200 nm thermal oxide SiO2 (Siegert \n\nWafer GmbH, Germany) and the in-house grown N-CNTs was performed. \n\nTable 8: ALD/MLD sequence of pulsing and residence times, tpulse and tresidence, of the precursors DEZ and TPA \n\nused for one cycle of Zn-TPA deposition and separated by intermediate N2-purging steps. \n\nDEZ injection N2 purge TPA injection N2 purge \ntpulse / s tresidence / s tpurge / s tpulse / s tresidence / s tpurge / s \n\n1 10 20 3 10 20 \n\n \n\nThe Zn-TPA hybrid thin films on Si(100) and N-CNTs were analyzed in top-view by SEM and EDX \n\nin a Hitachi FE-SEM SU-70 at 15 kV acceleration voltage equipped with a field emission gun. For \n\nsome samples SEM cross-section views were prepared.  Coated N-CNT samples were imaged in a FE-\n\nSTEM/SEM Hitachi HD-2700. Structural analysis by GIXRD was performed in a Philips X\u2019Pert \n\nMRD diffractometer (Cu K? @ 45 kV, 40 mA). Finally, FTIR spectroscopy of Zn-TP films that were \n\ndeposited on KBr pellets was conducted in a Bruker Tensor 27 for identifying organic components. \n\nFTIR scans in the range between 350 and 4000 cm-1 with a resolution of 4 cm-1 resolution were \n\nperformed. As the thin films on Si substrates yielded only a weak FTIR signal, the idea of directly \n\ndepositing on the IR transparent KBr pellets occurred. In particular, a Zn-TP film that formed inside \n\nthe deposition chamber and not on the substrate was scratched from the reactor wall and mixed \n\ntogether with KBr and pressed into a pellet for FTIR analysis in transmission. Moreover, pure TPA \n\nin a KBr pellet was measured as a reference. Furthermore, UV-Vis spectroscopy was carried out in a \n\nJasco V-560 with an ISV-469 integrated sphere attachment in a wavelength range between \n\n250 to 850 nm for films deposited at 150, 175 and 200 \u00b0C. A white BaSO4 tile was used as reference. \n\n\n\n \n\nEXPERIMENTAL 39 \n\nSpectra were obtained already converted to Kubelka-Munk units from the measurement software. \n\nBandgaps were determined from Tauc-plots. AFM images were acquired in a Multimode SPM \n\nNanoscope IIIA AFM (Veeco Instruments Inc., USA) in tapping mode using an ultra-sharp silicon tip \n\nSSH-NCH (Nanosensors, USA). The freeware image software WSxM 4.0 Beta 8.5 was used for data \n\nprocessing of the AFM images.80 \n\n \n\n7.5.2 ALD/MLD by Eu(TMHD)3 and TPA \n\nEu(TMHD)3 and TPA were used as precursors following the routine of the previous depositions of \n\nDEZ and TPA. Three attempts of deposition with the parameters summarized in Table 9 were \n\ncompleted when handing in this manuscript. In a first attempt, the TPA sublimation temperature was \n\nfixed at 190 \u00b0C as in chapter 7.5.1 and the Eu(TMHD)3 sublimation temperature at 140 \u00b0C as reported \n\nby Giedraityte et al.52 These authors investigated a deposition temperature range between 240 and \n\n340 \u00b0C with a reported ALD window between 260 and 300 \u00b0C. As Giedraityte found evidence for a \n\ncrystalline film at 300 \u00b0C, this deposition temperature was chosen in the first attempt. During film \n\ndeposition a similar working pressure of 1.6 \u2013 1.8 torr (2.1 \u2013 2.4 mbar) compared to the 1.5 \u2013 3 torr (2 \n\n\u2013 4 mbar) used by Giedraityte was maintained. Giedraityte used the following ALD/MLD sequence \n\nin comparison: 1 s Eu(TMHD)3 / 2 s N2 purge / 2 s TPA / 4 s N2 purge. As no film formation was \n\nobserved after the first attempt, other deposition parameters as shown in Table 9 were tried. The \n\n300 \u00b0C of deposition temperature in the first run led to degradation of the Silicone VMQ O-ring \n\n(Eriks nv) used for sealing the chamber and forced lower deposition temperatures in the subsequent \n\nruns. \n\n \n\nTable 9: ALD/MLD sequence of pulsing and residence times, tpulse and tresidence, of the precursors Eu(TMHD)3 \n\nand TPA used for one cycle of deposition and separated by intermediate N2-purging steps. \n\n# Deposition \ntemp. in \u00b0C  \n\nCanister temp.  \nin \u00b0C \n\nEu(TMHD)3 \ninjection \n\nN2 purge TPA injection N2 purge \n\nEu(TMHD)3 TPA tpulse / s tresidence / s tpurge / s tpulse / s tresidence / s tpurge / s \n\n1 300 140 190 2 5 10 3 5 10 \n\n2 200 140 190 3 10 20 3 10 20 \n\n3 220 160 210 3 10 20 3 10 20 \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nRESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION 41 \n\n8 Results &amp; Discussion \n\nResults for the deposition of several systems as shown in Figure 25 including their characterization \n\nwill be presented in a consistent manner.

In the top graph an overview of the \n\ncurves is given over the whole temperature range of data acquisition. Horizontal plateaus indicate \n\nconstant weight. The decreasing relative weights (negative differential weight changes) in the curves \n\nare related to weight loss due to thermal evaporation of the precursors. HMIM evaporates first, \n\nfollowed by Cu(TMHD)2, Eu(TMHD)3 and TPA. The scaling in the top graph prevents a precise \n\ndetection of the beginning of weight loss for each curve. Therefore, in the bottom graph an inset is \n\ngiven to determine the onset of evaporation of the solid precursors and to choose the canister \n\ntemperature for the ALD/MLD process. Canister temperatures that were used in literature are \n\npresented in Table 10. The evaporation temperatures are verified by the here presented TGA result. \n\nHowever, and in particular for the case of TPA, higher temperatures can be used for creating more \n\nvapor pressure. HMIM, Cu(TMHD)2 and TPA are completely evaporated before reaching their \n\nboiling/decomposition points, that are collected in Table 10. Their relative weights decrease \n\ncontinuously until 0%.  In contrast, the relative weight curve of Eu(TMHD)3 shows a transition into \n\na plateau after reaching the decomposition temperature at 275 \u00b0C. Steps in the Cu(TMHD)2 curve \n\naround 100 \u00b0C could be related to evaporation of water. Although the powder samples are stored in a \n\nglove box under inert conditions, it is possible that the powder caught humidity during sample \n\ntransport. Relative weights of more than 100 % in the TGA curves could be caused by the additional \n\nor unstable N2 flow that influences the weight measurement of the microbalance. For an improvement \n\na weight calibration with N2 flow should be done before the experiments. Further thermal analysis \n\ncould be carried out by methods such as Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), for example to \n\ndetermine vapor pressure curves. \n\n\n\n \n\nRESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION 43 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 26: Thermogravimetric analysis of TPA, HMIM, Cu(TMHD)2 and Eu(TMHD)3 powders in a dynamic \n\nN2 flow.

Wurtzite crystal structure of the forming ZnO nanocrystallites \n\nwas proven by GIXRD. A GPC of 1.9 \u00c5 deduced from XRR film thickness measurements was found \n\nfor the ZnO layer growth and is according to the literature. \n\n \n\n8.2.1 SEM/EDX/STEM of ZnO films \n\nThe following top-view SEM images show the growth of ZnO thin films both on flat Si(100) surfaces \n\nas well as on N-CNTs. From Figure 27 to Figure 32 the evolution of the growing film from the bare \n\nSi and N-CNT substrates, over 50 cycles to 200 cycles of ZnO deposition is illustrated for a deposition \n\ntemperature of 100 \u00b0C from top to bottom. All pictures were taken at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV \n\nby use of a secondary electron (SE) detector.  \n\n\n\n \n\nRESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION 45 \n\nCompared to the bare Si substrate in Figure 27 the forming ZnO film in Figure 28 and in Figure \n\n29 exhibit a brighter material contrast due to the heavier Zn metal ions containing in the film. \n\nFurthermore, the rough surface is revealed by the topographical contrast due to the edge effect \n\nshown in the theory chapter 6.1 in Figure 16. While for the 50 cycles of ZnO deposition in Figure \n\n28 the ZnO crystallites are still small and look round from above, they develop to be more elongated \n\nfor 200 cycles in Figure 29. This more needle-like morphology is probably related to the anisotropic \n\nc-axis crystal growth of the wurtzite ZnO structure that is reported in the literature.78 However, \n\nfor a deposition temperature of 100 \u00b0C the crystallite orientation is randomly distributed as \n\nadditionally confirmed later by GIXRD in chapter 8.2.3. It has to be considered that a top view can \n\nonly give a 2D limited information. Jeon et al., present top-view SEM images for ZnO films grown \n\nat 90 and 110 \u00b0C.81 At 90 \u00b0C the morphology looks also granular from above, but XRD \n\nmeasurements reveal a preferential c-axis crystal growth in the (100) direction. Hence, the ZnO \n\ncolumns are grown perpendicular to the Si substrate surface at 90 \u00b0C. At 110 \u00b0C they also observe \n\nrandomly oriented, elongated crystallites. The deposition, here at 100\u00b0C, could be in a transition \n\nregion where temperature deviations could either lead to the one or the other morphology.81 \n\nIn Figure 33 an EDX mapping was performed on the 200 ALD cycles ZnO film on Si(100). The \n\nhomogenous distribution of Zn (red) and O (green) is visualized qualitatively. An EDX spectrum \n\nshown in Figure 34 was recorded from the same sample. The EDX spectrum qualitatively proves \n\nthe presence of ZnO by the Zn L?, Zn K? and O K? lines. The C K? signal is due to the carbon tape \n\nthat was used to mount the sample on the sample holder.

After 50 \n\nALD cycles of ZnO deposition the N-CNTs are already coated in conformal manner as shown in \n\nFigure 31. The ZnO films grown on the N-CNTs are also polycrystalline as visible in the contrast-\n\nrich images of the coated N-CNTs. Brighter appearing parts of the bare N-CNTs or the coated N-\n\nCNTs are mainly caused by the edge effect in bent sections of the nanotubes as marked in Figure \n\n32. STEM images in Figure 36 and Figure 37 show secondary electron (SE) and transmission \n\nelectron (TE) in bright-field mode of a single N-CNT coated with 200 ALD cycles ZnO. The \n\npolycrystalline film morphology can be seen here in more detail. In particular, the TE images that \n\nreveal the lattice fringes of ZnO crystallites were analyzed by the freeware software ImageJ.C The \n\nlattice plane distances d were directly measured in Figure 37 b) for differently oriented crystallites \n\nand can be related to the results from GIXRD measurements in chapter 8.2.3., from which lattice \n\nplane distances dhkl of the hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO could be determined (d100 = 2.8 \u00c5; \n\nd002 = 2.6 \u00c5). However, the precision of the image analysis does not allow to state whether d100 or \n\nd002 distances are observed. \n\n                                                      \nC ImageJ 1.50i, Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, USA \n\n200 ALD cycles ZnO \n\nedge effect \n\n\n\n \n\nRESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION 49 \n\n \n\nFigure 33: EDX mapping of 200 ALD cycles ZnO on Si(100) showing qualitatively the homogeneous film \n\ncomposed by Zn (red) and O (green). \n\n \n\nFigure 34: EDX spectrum of 200 ALD cycles ZnO on Si(100) with assigned emission energy lines according \n\nto Goodhew.56  \n\n\n\n \n\nRESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION 50 \n\n \n\nFigure 35: EDX spectrum of 200 ALD cycles ZnO on N-CNTs with assigned emission energy lines according \n\nto Goodhew.56 \n\n \n\nFigure 36: Secondary electron (SE) STEM image of 200 ALD cycles of ZnO on a single N-CNT. \n\n\n\n \n\nRESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION 51 \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 37: a) Transmission electron (TE) bright-field image of 200 ALD cycles of ZnO on a single N-CNT in \n\nSTEM. b) Inset with lattice plane fringes highlighted in yellow and measured lattice plane distance d.  \n\na) \n\nb) \n\n\n\n \n\nRESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION 52 \n\nALD growth of ZnO nanoparticles and polycrystalline thin films with a H2O/DEZ process on multi-\n\nwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)82 and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)83, 84 have \n\nalready been reported before. In the first publications the non-uniform deposition in form of the \n\ndecoration of isolated ZnO nanoparticles was reported, but continuous coatings of ZnO layers were \n\nonly occasionally observed. The initial nucleation of ZnO on the CNTs was recognized to be extremely \n\nsensitive to surface conditions. Due to the hydrophobic nature of the untreated CNTs there was seen \n\na need for surface functionalization with oxygen containing reactive sites. Moreover, it was  reported \n\nthat the degree of surface functionalization defines the growth mode of deposited metal oxide films on  \n\nCNTs.85, 86  In the work of Pal et al., SWCNTs were activated with an ozone treatment for uniform \n\nZnO film growth.84 The here used CNTs are nitrogen-doped N-MWCNTs. The nitrogen plays an \n\nactive role for the nucleation of ZnO films and explains the here reported conformal coatings. \n\nSilva et al., demonstrated Zn-N bonding at the interface between N-CNTs and ZnO films by means of \n\nX-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS).76 ZnO coated CNTs were proposed for application as UV \n\nphotodetectors or as ambipolar thin film transistors. Moreover, a switchable behaviour of the \n\nwettability under UV irradiation was shown altering from superhydrophobic to superhydrophilic.84 \n\n \n\n8.2.2 XRR of ZnO films \n\nThe thickness t and density ? of the ZnO films with 50, 100 and 200 ALD cycles of deposition were \n\nanalyzed by XRR measurements as shown in Figure 38 and are summarized in Table 11. The GPC \n\nwas simply derived from the thickness divided by the number of cycles. \n\nIn Figure 38 it can be seen qualitatively that the fringe distance is increasing with decreasing number \n\nof cycles of deposition. This meets the expectations as the film thickness decreases with less deposition \n\ncycles. The thickness t was calculated from equation (5) in chapter 6.3 from adjacent fringe positions \n\nthat are designated in the XRR curves. The XRR curves for 100 and 200 ALD cycles show clear \n\nfringes and the mean thickness was determined from several fringe pairs. For the 50 cycles the fringe \n\npositions could only be vaguely determined from the fringes adumbrated in grey. Especially for low \n\nfilm thicknesse an inhomogeneous thickness and roughness of the sample can lead to superimposed \n\nfringe patterns. Film densities ? were calculated by equation (4) with xZn = xO = 0.5, the molar weights \n\nMZn = 65.38 g/mol and MO = 16 g/mol and the atomic numbers ZZn = 30 and ZO = 8. The results are \n\npresented in Table 11. The density of bulk ZnO is 5.61 g/cm\u00b3. Varying critical angles can be noticed \n\nby comparing the three XRR curves. This effect is probably not related to the ZnO thin films which \n\nshould approximately have the same critical angle and, thus, density. Uncertainties in densities derived \n\nfrom XRR have been reported to be very sensitive to sample alignment and beam calibration by \n\nKlepper et al.87 In a simple error approximation as shown in equation (11) it can be seen that an \n\n\n\n \n\nRESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION 53 \n\ninaccuracy of ??c = 0.05\u00b0 due to the squared contribution of the critical angle in the density \n\nformula (4) leads to large deviations for the determined densities.  \n\n?? = ??? ?\n??\n\n???\n=\n\n?\n\n?? ?\n2??\n\n?\n??? + ??\n??? + ??\n\n? ??? ?\n1\n\n2\n?? \n\n(11) \n\n \n\nTable 11: Characteristics of the ALD grown ZnO films of 50, 100 and 200 ALD cycles of deposition deduced \n\nfrom XRR measurements.

The determined GPC of 1.9 \n\n\u00c5 is in excellent accordance to the values reported for various ZnO ALD processes summarized in \n\nTable 12. Moreover, the ZnO growth mechanism was studied in detail by Yousfi et al., in an in situ \n\nanalysis of the mass variation for individual ZnO deposition cycles by means of a quartz balance. The \n\nmass uptake was reported to be around 0.1 to 0.12 mg/cm\u00b2 corresponding to a thickness per cycle of \n\n1.75 to 2.1 \u00c5, which further confirms the here found GPC. \n\n \nTable 12:  ALD characteristics reported for the growth of ZnO thin films by ALD.

Taken from Malm et al.79 \n\n \n\nThe ZnO deposition at 100 \u00b0C was found to yield uniform nanocrystalline films. Diffraction peaks \n\nrelated to the wurtzite ZnO structure represented in Figure 40 were distinguished. With decreasing \n\ncycles the peak intensities are decreasing due to the lower film thickness and the smaller volume that \n\nis probed by the X-ray beam. For the 50 cycles sample only the (110) peak is left to be clearly \n\ndistinguishable from the background. \n\nAlmost similar intensities for the (100) and (002) peak for the 200 ALD cycles sample show that the \n\ngrown ZnO crystallites have no preferential orientation. This confirms the observations of the SEM \n\nanalysis in chapter 8.2.1 and for a deposition temperature of 100 \u00b0C this is in accordance with literature. \n\nIndeed, it was reported that deposition temperature can be used to control the preferred grain \n\norientation as reviewed by Tynell and Karppinen.72 For low deposition temperatures below 70 \u00b0C ZnO \n\nfilms were reported to be highly c-axis oriented along the (002) direction as shown in Figure 41.79 \n\nAbove 70 \u00b0C a-axis orientation along the (100) direction becomes more prominent and c-axis \n\norientation becomes less prominent, so that in the range around 90 to 160 \u00b0C ZnO thin films are not \n\ntextured.78, 81, 89-91 The here produced films confirm this for 100 \u00b0C. Between 160 to 200 \u00b0C grains are \n\npredominantly oriented along the a-axis and above 220 \u00b0C an evolution towards preferred c-axis \n\norientation can be observed again. A more detailed texture analysis of the ZnO film could be performed \n\nby means of XRD pole figures as reported by Pung et al.78 In their paper the motivation for a textured \n\nfilm along the c-axis is the use as a seed layer for the controlled directional growth of ZnO nanowires. \n\nMoreover, the chemical composition, physical structure and electrical properties can be tuned and \n\noptimized by the deposition temperature and hence film morphology. The latter is important for \n\nmicro- and optoelectronic applications.81  \n\n\n\n \n\nRESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION 57 \n\n \n\nFigure 41: Evolution of the (002) and (100) diffraction peak intensities with increasing deposition temperature \n\nfor ZnO thin films grown by DEZ/H2O ALD process on Si(100). Taken from Malm et al.79 \n\n \n\nIn general the peak width in a diffractogram is mainly a result of the folding of apparative parameters. \n\nFurthermore, in case of nanocrystalline materials with crystallite sizes below 150 to 200 nm a peak \n\nbroadening effect can also be observed due to the finite object size.63 The linear dimension L of the \n\ncrystallite size can be determined from the width of a peak arising from a family of planes (hkl), the full \n\nwidth at half maximum (FWHM) by means of the Scherrer formula represented in equation (12).63 The \n\nScherrer formfactor K = 0.89 and the wavelength of the incident X-ray (Cu K? = 0.154 nm) are \n\nconstants.

Considering \n\nthe film thickness of 36 nm determined by XRR of the 200 ALD cycles ZnO, the values derived \n\nmanually with Origin are arguable. The crystallite sizes determined by HighScore Plus are probably \n\nmore accurate due to an optimized fitting routine. The here reported crystallite sizes between 12 \n\nand 15 nm are valid for the grown ZnO films on Si(100) at 100 \u00b0C by 200 ALD cycles. Verifying this, \n\nChiang et al., report a mean grain size of 13.7 nm for films grown at 100 \u00b0C on Si(100) and 17.7 nm at \n\n200 \u00b0C derived by the Scherrer equation.92 Pal et al., report wedge-shaped crystallites with a mean \n\ngrain size of 21.2 nm for 230 ALD cycles ZnO grown at 200 \u00b0C on Si(100). Yuan et al., report grain \n\nsizes of 15.6 nm 17.1, 18.1 and 19.5 nm for ZnO thin films grown at 50, 70, 100 and 200 \u00b0C, \n\nrespectively.89 As a conclusion it can be stated, that ALD grown ZnO films exhibit nanocrystallites \n\nwith sizes around roughly 15 nm. The grain size, morphology and texture is dependent on the growth \n\ntemperature as discussed above. Higher temperatures promote grain growth and thicker films contain \n\nlarger grains as more time is given to coarsening.  \n\nFrom the (100) and (002) peaks the lattice parameters a and c of the hexagonal wurtzite structure can \n\nbe deduced by means of the Bragg\u2019s law in equation (6). The wavelength of the incident Cu K? \n\nradiation with ? = 0.154 nm is used. For the hexagonal crystal systems the interplanar distance dhkl is \n\nrelated to the lattice parameters a and c by the following equation (14).93 \n\n1\n\n????\n2\n\n=\n4\n\n3\n(\n\n?2 + ?? + ?2\n\n?2\n) +\n\n?2\n\n?2\n \n\n(14) \n\nFrom the peak positions of the (100) and (002) peak the lattice parameters a and c are calculated from \n\nthe peak positions of the Origin fit (Figure 42, Table 13) by equations (15) and (16). Propagated \n\nincertainties are given by the merely statistical error of the peak position ??hkl as depicted above. The \n\ninterplanar distances are d100 = 2.8 \u00c5 and d002 =2.6 \u00c5. The lattice parameters a = 3.25 \u00b1 0.03 \u00c5 and \n\nc = 5.21 \u00b1 0.04 \u00c5 are in agreement with the data from the ICDD fileG (a = 3.25 \u00c5; c = 5.21 \u00c5).

The image areas were randomly chosen to be representative for the sample. The AFM \n\nimages show light contrast spots with diameters up to more than 100 nm and marking heights up to \n\naround 30 nm. These islands can be considered as clusters of ZnO nanocrystallites that were found in \n\nthe previous SEM and GIXRD analysis. Besides the roughness originated in the polycrystalline film \n\nmorphology, these clusters have the main influence on the overall surface roughness of the samples \n\nshown here. The root mean square (RMS) roughness values deduced for the different scanning \n\nwindows are reported in Figure 44. As the determined RMS roughness for the 5 \u00b5m x 5 \u00b5m section \n\ncovers the largest area it can be considered as the most representative value for the overall film \n\nroughness. More cluster islands are taken into account than in the smaller scanning windows.  \n\n \n\n    \n\nFigure 43: AFM topography images of 200 ALD cycles ZnO thin films on Si(100) for scanning areas 1 \u00b5m x 1 \n\n\u00b5m (left) and 0.5 \u00b5m x 0.5 \u00b5m (right). Heights are given according to the color scale bars.  \n\n \n\nThe here found roughness values of ALD ZnO films are compared with the literature in Figure 44. \n\nThe choice of different scan areas in various references has to be considered. The main influence on \n\nthe roughness is the deposition temperature and number of cycles as these parameters directly \n\ninfluence the grain growth (size and orientation) of the polycrystalline films. It has to be considered \n\nthat the roughness increases with the deposited film thickness and increasing grain size.77, 94 \n\nAdditionally, the type and roughness of the substrate affect the final film roughness. Moreover, Pung \n\net al., showed that a recrystallization by a post-annealing at 800 \u00b0C has a significant effect on the surface \n\nmorphology, thus, leading to an increase in surface roughness.78 The here reported roughness values \n\nare in agreement with the literature when identical growth parameters and image areas are compared. \n\nAround 100 \u00b0C deposition temperatures the highest roughness values are observed.

The roughness values reported for ALD \n\ndeposited films are smaller than for solution based deposition methods. Weng et al., report RMS \n\nroughness values between 36 and 122 nm for electrodeposited ZnO films.95 Smooth film morphologies \n\nare beneficial for the performance of electronic devices, such as solar cells, in which ZnO films can be \n\nused as transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layers. The formation of smooth, conformal films by ALD \n\nis therefore interesting for optoelectronic applications.94 \n\n \n\nFigure 44: RMS roughness of ALD deposited ZnO films determined from AFM measurements of this work \n\ncompared to literature results.

Firstly, the transformation of a sacrificial ZnO film into ZIF-8 by a MOF-CVD process was \n\nattempted. Secondly, a direct gas-phase process by MOF-MLD was tried. Neither of the two studied \n\nroutes could demonstrate the formation of a MOF thin film. Nevertheless, the experimental procedure \n\nand findings are explained and motivations are discussed. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nRESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION 62 \n\n8.3.1 MOF-CVD of sacrificial ZnO films \n\nAs the successful ZnO deposition was demonstrated in this work, it was a consequent step to further \n\nexploit this capability by using ZnO thin film samples for a post-treatment as reported by Stassen et \n\nal.30 Within the given possibilities of the here used ALD equipment it was attempted to reproduce this \n\nwork. In the work of Stassen, the solid-vapor conversion of ALD ZnO thin films with thickness \n\nbetween 3 and 15 nm by exposure to HMIM vapor at 100 \u00b0C for 30 min was proved. Here,  ALD ZnO \n\nthin films with thickness 10 nm (50 ALD cycles) and 18 nm (100 ALD cycles) were used and exposed \n\nto HMIM at 110 \u00b0C.  Upon transformation Stassen et al., report a thickness increase of a planar ZnO \n\nfilm by a factor of 17 as visible in SEM cross-sections. Here, in SEM images of ZnO coated N-CNTs \n\non which the HMIM treatment was applied, no significant thickness increase of the layer could be \n\nobserved. Thus, a transformation of the ZnO film can definitely be argued. Although similar \n\nparameters (thickness of initial ZnO thin films, treatment temperature and duration etc.) were kept \n\nsimilar, the integration of imidazolate linkers by the HMIM and transformation into a MOF could not \n\nbe demonstrated. In an effort to force a vapor-solid transformation the exposure temperature was \n\nincreased to 130 \u00b0C and humid conditions by additional H2O injection were employed. The idea for \n\nthis attempt was based on the findings of Stassen that a temperature increase from 115 \u00b0C to 130 \u00b0C \n\nand a humid N2 flow facilitated the transformation reaction in a mixture of ZnO and HMIM powder \n\nas shown in Figure 45.  \n\n  \n\nFigure 45: ZIF-8 phase quantification for in situ reaction experiment of a ZnO/HMIM powder mixture.          \n\na) Reaction at 115 and 130 \u00b0C exposure temperature. b) Reaction performed in continuous dry N2 flow and N2 \n\nflow humidified to 33% relative humidity (right). Taken from Stassen et al.30 \n\n \n\nIn the presented graphs the weight fractions of forming ZIF-8 increase sigmoidally with exposure \n\ntime. However, even with the intensified exposure parameters and an effective exposure time of 80 min \n\nno evidence for a film conversion was observed by comparing SEM images and EDX spectra before \n\nand after the HMIM exposure as shown in Figure 46 and Figure 47. \n\nb) a) \n\n\n\n \n\nRESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION 63 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 46: Top-view SEM images of 50 ALD cycles ZnO on Si(100) a) before and b) after HMIM exposure at \n\n130 \u00b0C for effectively 80 min by additional H20 pulsing. c) Corresponding EDX spectra before (red) and after \n\nexposure (blue).  \n\n \n\nIn Figure 46 c) the Zn and O signals diminish in the EDX spectra and the top-view SEM image \n\n(Figure 46 b) shows no contrast after exposure.

In Raman spectroscopy of the exposed samples (not \n\nshown here) only a characteristic Raman band at 520 cm-1 of the used Si substrate was detected.96 The \n\nGIXRD diffractogram (not shown here) of the exposed film showed a weak intensity ZnO pattern \n\nsimilar to the one for a 50 ALD cycles ZnO film that was shown in Figure 39. No characteristic ZIF-\n\n8 peaks as reported by Stassen et al., were observed.30 \n\nHMIM/H2O exposure  @ 130 \u00b0C for 80 min \n \n\nZnO on Si(100) before after \n\nc) \n\na) b) \n\n\n\n \n\nRESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION 64 \n\nFigure 47: SEM images of 50 ALD cycles ZnO on N-CNTs a) before and b) after HMIM exposure at 130 \u00b0C for \n\neffectively 80 min by additional H20 pulsing. c) Corresponding EDX spectra in the bottom before (red) and after \n\nexposure (blue).   \n\n \n\nAlso in Figure 47 diminishing EDX signals for Zn and O are observed after exposure. Furthermore, \n\nin the SEM images the light contrast of the heavy Zn on the N-CNTs is reduced after exposure. \n\nEvaluating Figure 46 and Figure 47, it can be even assumed that the HMIM/H2O treatment removes \n\nthe ZnO film rather than transforms it.  However, the results of Stassen could not be reproduced. \n\nIt has to be mentioned that the here used injection of HMIM and H2O into the reactor chamber was \n\ndone in a cycled manner and interrupted by intermediate purging due to the used ALD reactor. This \n\nis fundamentally different to Stassen\u2019s work, where the ZnO thin film sample was suspended top-down, \n\n  \n\n \n\na) b) \n\nHMIM/H2O exposure  @ 130 \u00b0C for 80 min \n \n\nZnO on N-CNTs before after \n\nc) \n\n\n\n \n\nRESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION 65 \n\n5 cm above a heated bed of HMIM powder. Hence, the ZnO films were continuously exposed to the \n\nHMIM vapor. Stassen et al., strongly emphasize on the necessity of a continuous transformation \n\nreaction, because experiments with halted and resumed HMIM exposure showed decreased fractions \n\nof transformed ZIF-8 compared to a continuous treatment. Stassen relates this observation with a \n\nsuggested conversion mechanism, in which an important role is given to the water during the \n\nneutralization reaction.30 Water is assumed to retain at the transformation interface and keeping the \n\nMOF building blocks mobile for framework self-assembly. Moreover, the liquid-like character might \n\nenable the protonation of the organic linker and hydratation of the ZnO. In this hypothesis, a halted \n\ntransformation could lead to dehydration and immobilization of the surface layer and prevent a \n\nrestarted reaction. In conclusion, this could explain that no conversion was observed due to the cyclic \n\nexposure by HMIM pulses in this work. \n\n \n\n8.3.2 MOF-MLD by DEZ and HMIM \n\nIn addition to the reproduction of a 2-step MOF-CVD route a direct ALD/MLD method towards \n\nproducing a ZIF-8 MOF was tried. The sequential injection of DEZ and HMIM aiming at a bottom-\n\nup thin film formation was expected to adequately exploit the ability of the here used ALD reactor in \n\ncontrast to the MOF-CVD route. Furthermore, the finding of a direct gas-phase route was more in \n\nthe scope of this work than a 2-step strategy depending on a post-treatment. However, neither on \n\nSi(100) nor on N-CNTs a significant thin film deposition by DEZ/HMIM injection or in the three \n\nprecursor route DEZ/HMIM/H2O could be observed in SEM images. In case of the deposition \n\nattempts on N-CNTs (not shown here) weak Zn signals were found and in a subsequent STEM/EDX \n\nanalysis small evidence was found for nucleation. A corresponding secondary electron STEM image \n\nis shown in Figure 48. The light contrast seen on the nanotubes could be a sign for nucleation. Further \n\nXPS studies could clarify if a successful N-Zn linkage characteristic for a ZIF-8 was achieved. \n\nNevertheless, Raman spectra yielded no characteristic bands apart from the characteristic N-CNT \n\nsignal and the two attempted processes seem not to yield a significant coating given the STEM image. \n\n\n\n \n\nRESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION 66 \n\n \n\nFigure 48: Secondary electron STEM image of attempted deposition of 200 ALD/MLD cycles of DEZ/HMIM \n\non N-CNTs at 140 \u00b0C. \n\n \n\n8.4 Direct routes towards terephthalate hybrid thin films \n\nIn this chapter experimental works towards producing terephthalate hybrid thin films are presented. \n\nALD/MLD deposition of the organic precursor terephthalic acid (TPA) in combination with the metal \n\nsources DEZ was studied and attempted with Eu(TMHD)3, aiming at a luminescent hybrid film. \n\nEventually, Zn-terephthalate (Zn-TP) hybrid thin films could be successfully synthesized on Si(100), \n\nSi/SiO2 and N-CNT substrates. FTIR measurements confirmed the bonding between the organic \n\nbicarboxylate and the Zn. Eu-TP thin films could not be synthesized up to now.  \n\nThe motivation for using TPA lies in the fact, that TPA is an easily available and commonly utilized \n\norganic precursor for hybrid frameworks due to its rigid aromatic structure and thermostability. For \n\ninstance, terephthalate linkers interconnect the inorganic ZnO4 units in the prototypic MOF-5 \n\nstructure as shown in Figure 11. In terms of chemical composition the use of DEZ/TPA justifies an \n\nattempt to potentially synthesize a MOF-5 or similar hybrid structure in an ALD/MLD deposition. \n\nIn related studies DEZ was used together with the also bifunctional phenol hydroquinone to create \n\nsuperlattice structures with potential application as thermoelectrics. 97-99 ZnO interdispersed with \n\nsingle layers of hydroquinone and variable ZnO-hydroquinone layer ratios were reported. Moreover, \n\nin works by Klepper et al., amorphous organic-inorganic hybrid thin films were formed by the widely \n\nused organometallic precursor trimethylaluminium (TMA) together with TPA among other various \n\nlinear and aromatic carboxylic acids.87, 100-102  \n\n\n\n \n\nRESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION 67 \n\n8.4.1 ALD/MLD by DEZ and TPA  \n\nDeposition of thin films by use of DEZ and TPA precursors was demonstrated on various substrates \n\nlike Si(100), Si with thermal oxide (Si/SiO2) and N-CNTs in order to investigate the film formation \n\nand nucleation behaviour on different surfaces. A first remarkable feature of the thin film samples in \n\nthis chapter was the observation of view angle dependent coloration as shown in Figure 49. This was \n\ndifferent compared to the ZnO film samples that were deposited in previous experiments and is related \n\nto the comparably larger film thickness. The coloration can be explained with optical interference \n\neffects of the thin films in the visible region of light, which is for instance dependent on the film \n\nthickness. For instance, this property was exploited in solution-processed ZIF-8 based Fabry-P\u00e9rot \n\ndevices reported by Lu103 and shows the versatility of applications for MOF in the field of thin film \n\noptics. The function principle of the reported selective chemical vapor sensor devices used changes in \n\nthe refractive index and interference properties upon gas adsorption in the open framework structure. \n\nHowever, this example is a side note for this work. As presented in the following the Zn-TP thin films \n\ndeposited at various temperatures were extensively characterized by SEM/EDX, GIXRD, FTIR, UV-\n\nVis and AFM.  \n\n \n\nFigure 49: Overview of colored Zn-TP samples deposited with different numbers of ALD/MLD cycles on \n\nSi(100) and Si/SiO2 substrates at different temperatures. Some samples were broken for cross-section analysis \n\nin SEM. \n\n \n\n8.4.1.1 SEM/EDX/STEM of Zn-terephthalate hybrid films \n\nIn Figure 50 SEM images with top-views and cross-sections of thin films deposited at 200 \u00b0C by 300 \n\nALD/MLD cycles of DEZ/TPA. Images for deposition on Si/SiO2 and Si(100) substrates are shown \n\nfor comparison. In the top-views of the films a flake-like morphology can be observed for the film \n\nforming on Si/SiO2, whereas a needle-like morphology is observed for the film forming on Si(100). \n\nThe cross-section reveals a significantly higher film thickness of 195 nm for deposition on the Si/SiO2 \n\nsubstrate compared to the 118 nm thickness in case of the Si(100) substrate. The comparison reveals \n\nthe influence of the substrate type for thin film growth and indicates that Si/SiO2 seems to promote \n\nthe film nucleation by enhanced chemisorption. \n\n\n\n \n\nRESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION 68 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 50: SEM images of Zn-TP hybrid thin films deposited by 300 ALD/MLD cycles at 200 \u00b0C.

In case of the thin film grown \n\non Si/SiO2 at 200 \u00b0C, a GPC of 6.5 \u00c5 can be determined.  Compared to inorganic metal oxides like \n\nZnO with the demonstrated GPC of 1.9 \u00c5, this is a remarkably high value and is a strong indication \n\nthat the organic terephthalate moiety was incorporated into the film. Salmi et al., used zinc acetate \n\n(ZnAc2) and TPA as precursors and report a similar GPC of 6.5 \u00c5 at 225 \u00b0C for as-deposited \n\namorphous films.37  \n\nIn Figure 51 GPCs determined from film thickness of Zn-TP films are shown for various \n\ntemperatures. The data from Salmi et al., is given as a reference. These workers observed an increasing \n\ntrend for the GPC with decreasing deposition temperature and related this to TPA condensation. \n\nPrecursor condensation increases the GPC as shown in Figure 6 in the ALD/MLD theory part. In \n\nother works of Karppinen TPA condensation was also assumed to induce a CVD-like character of the \n\nALD/MLD process. The here reported value for DEZ/TPA deposition on Si/SiO2 fits to the data of \n\nSalmi. Surprisingly, thin films deposited below 200 \u00b0C seem not to follow the trend of increasing GPC \n\nwith decreasing temperature. In order to draw a conclusion more data is needed for a complete study \n\nof the here reported ALD/MLD process. However, the deposition temperature has an important \n\ninfluence on the GPC. Figure 52 shows top-view SEM images for hybrid thin films deposited on \n\nSi(100) at various temperatures. It can be observed that the varying deposition temperatures also lead \n\nto different surface morphologies. This could also be related to different film thicknesses and growth \n\nstages. From 150 \u00b0C to 200 \u00b0C the grains develop from granular to needle-like morphology. For 250 \n\n\u00b0C a fine-grained structure evolves. All the here observed morphologies for deposition on Si(100) look \n\ndifferent compared to the flake-like morphology for deposition on Si/SiO2 as previously shown in \n\nFigure 50 a). In summary, the substrate and deposition temperature influence the film growth in terms \n\nof thickness and surface morphology. \n\nApart from deposition on flat Si and Si/SiO2 substrates, the SEM and STEM images in Figure 53 and \n\nFigure 54 demonstrate the successful growth of thin films on N-CNTs. From the STEM image the \n\nfilm thickness can be deduced film to be around 23 nm for 300 ALD/MLD cycles. The excellent \n\nconformality and uniformity of the Zn-TP hybrid thin films is highlighted. The ALD/MLD process \n\nis an ideal technique for fabrication of various organic-inorganic hybrid thin films regardless the \n\ngeometry of the substrate and therefore the design of novel functional materials that involve micro- \n\nor nanoscale control of dimensions. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nRESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION 70 \n\n \n\nFigure 51: ALD/MLD growth rates of hybrid thin films deposited at various temperatures by \n\nZnAc2/TPA by Salmi et al.,37 and by DEZ/TPA in this work. \n\n \n\nFigure 52: Sections of top-view SEM images comparing hybrid thin films deposited at various, designated \n\ndeposition temperatures (150, 175, 200 and 250 \u00b0C) by 400 ALD/MLD cycles of DEZ/TPA on Si(100). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nRESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION 71 \n\n \n\nFigure 53: SEM image of Zn-terephthalate hybrid thin film deposited at 200 \u00b0C by 300 ALD/MLD cycles of \n\nDEZ/TPA on N-CNTs.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 54: SE-STEM image of a single N-CNT coated with 300 ALD/MLD cycles of DEZ/TPA at 200 \u00b0C. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nRESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION 72 \n\n8.4.1.2 AFM of Zn-terephthalate hybrid films \n\nAFM measurements of randomly chosen sample areas of a Zn-TP hybrid thin film deposited by \n\n300 ALD/MLD cycles at 200 \u00b0C. Images of scanning areas 5 \u00b5m x 5 \u00b5m and 0.5 \u00b5m x 0.5 \u00b5m are \n\npresented in Figure 55 and corresponding RMS roughness values are given in Table 14. The images \n\nshow a rough surface with island-like grown granules with appearing voids in between them. This is \n\nin accordance to studies of Karppinen et al.,36, 50, 51 in which the high roughness was related to the \n\ncrystalline nature of the thin films. In the work of Karppinen et al., surface roughness was determined \n\nby XRR measurements with reported values of 7 to 8 nm for Cu-TP (MOF-2) and 6 nm for Ca-TP. \n\nHowever, Karppinen et al., report entirely crystalline hybrid films, whereas here only ZnO as a \n\ncrystalline component was proven in the thin films as shown in the subsequent chapter 8.4.1.3. Despite \n\nof the different number of ALD cycles, the AFM studies reveal that the as-prepared Zn-TP hybrid film \n\npresent distinct surface morphology features that are different compared to the ZnO film (chapter \n\n8.2.4), which can be due to the incorporation of the organic component. \n\n    \n\nFigure 55: AFM topography images of Zn-TP hybrid thin films deposited by 300 ALD/MLD cycles of \n\nDEZ/TPA on Si(100) at 200 \u00b0C for scanning areas 5 \u00b5m x 5 \u00b5m (left) and 0.5 \u00b5m x 0.5 \u00b5m (right).

For MOFs it is common to see diffraction peaks at low 2? angles below 20\u00b0 due to the large unit \n\ncells. Such peaks are not visible in Figure 56 and also not in another scan with lower step size in a low \n\nangle range as double-checked in Figure 57, neither on Si(100) nor on Si/SiO2 substrates. Thus, no \n\ncrystalline MOF-5 or related structure with large unit cell was directly deposited from the vapor-\n\nphase. This is in analogy to the work of Salmi et al., in which an as-deposited thin film was of amorphous \n\nnature.37 However, by a 2-step post-treatment with a first crystallization step in humid conditions \n\nfollowed by second solvothermal DMF treatment in an autoclave a recrystallization into MOF-5 was \n\nachieved. This indicates that an as-deposited amorphous framework already exists, but has to be \n\nstabilized by introduction of molecules into the pore interior.37, 38 Such a post-treatment of the here \n\ndeposited Zn-TP films could be part of further studies. However, a single-step gas phase method \n\ntowards a crystalline hybrid would be much more interesting from a technological point of view. In \n\nanother work of Karppinen et al., a narrow deposition temperature window between 180 and 190 \u00b0C is \n\nreported for direct deposition of crystalline Cu-TP (MOF-2),36 which could motivate a more detailed \n\nGIXRD study of ALD/MLD deposited Zn-TP at several temperatures in the follow-up of this work. \n\n \n\nFigure 56: GIXRD diffractograms of thin films deposited by 300 ALD/MLD cycles of DEZ/TPA at \n\n200 \u00b0C on Si(100).

This proves that the thin film contains crystalline \n\nZnO, but GIXRD can make no conclusion about possible coexisting amorphous phases that do not \n\nappear in a diffractogram. Diffraction patterns of ZnO were seen by Salmi et al., only after \n\ndecomposition of MOF-5 thin films at temperatures as high as 400 \u00b0C, but could evidence a conversion \n\nmechanisms that also played a role in the vapor-solid transformation of ZnO into ZIF-8 reported by \n\nStassen et al.30 In a related study Hermes et al., formed ZnO@MOF-5 nanocomposites on purpose by \n\nloading the open framework by penetration and hydrolysis of DEZ inside the pore interior. These \n\nexamples point out the complex chemistry involved. At this state the exact structure and composition \n\nof the here deposited Zn-terephthalate films stays unclear. Nevertheless, from here it is still probable \n\nthat the film exhibits a hybrid nature, for instance by coexistence of amorphous Zn-terephthalate and \n\ncrystalline ZnO in a hybrid film. For identification of the organic moiety and the linkage towards Zn \n\nfurther FTIR spectroscopy was performed in the subsequent chapter 8.4.1.4.   \n\n\n\n \n\nRESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION 75 \n\n8.4.1.4 FTIR of Zn-terephthalate hybrid films \n\nIn order to prove the existence of an organic-inorganic hybrid, the presence of the terephthalate in the \n\nthin film and its coordination towards the Zn was investigated in FTIR. Figure 58 shows the \n\ncorresponding FTIR spectrum in transmittance for thin films deposited by DEZ and TPA at 150, 175 \n\nand 200 \u00b0C and for a film that formed during several depositions on the reactor wall.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 58: FTIR spectra of Zn-TP hybrid thin films deposited by 400 ALD/MLD cycles at various temperatures \n\n(150, 175, 200 \u00b0C) on KBr pellets. A Zn-TP film that formed on the chamber wall was also analyzed. A TPA \n\nspectrum is given as reference and band assignments are given according to Yadav.67 An inset of the interesting \n\nregion of carboxylate stretching vibrations is given in Figure 59 below.  \n \n\nThe interesting region is between around 1300 and 1700 cm-1 (Figure 59), where the symmetric (?s) \n\nand asymmetric (?as) carboxylate (COO-) stretching vibrations can be found.37 After Yadav these \n\nstretching vibrations are generally located between 1300 and 1400 cm-1 (?s) and between 1550 and \n\n1650 cm-1 (?as), respectively. 67 The COO--Zn bond can be either of type I (unidentate), type II \n\n(bidentate) or type III (bridging) according to Table 15. The type is determined from the \n\ncharacteristic splitting ??= ?as \u2013 ?s. For all the Zn-TP hybrid films the symmetric stretching can be \n\nclearly found at around 1385 cm-1. For the asymmetric stretching several absorption bands at 1508, \n\n1543 and 1560 cm-1 can be considered for the films deposited at 175 and 200 \u00b0C. The film deposited at \n\n150 \u00b0C does not yield sharp bands. However, the found bands lead to splittings ?? that are \n\ncharacteristic for bridging type Zn-terephthalate bonding.  \n\n-OH C-C \n\nC-H \nIn-plane \n\nC-H \nOut-of-plane \n\nZn-O \nCOO- \n\nCO2 \n\nC=O \n\n\n\n \n\nRESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION 76 \n\n \n\nFigure 59: FTIR spectra of Zn-TP thin films deposited by 400 ALD/MLD cycles on KBr pellets at various \n\ntemperatures.

Furthermore, Li et al., explained a band \n\nat 1636 cm-1 with H2O adsorption on ZnO, which can also be found here. The absorption bands at \n\naround 415 cm-1 in Figure 58 can be attributed to a Zn-O stretching vibration. As reference \n\nSalmi et al.,37 report a Zn-O stretch at 520 cm-1 and Civalleri49 at 511 cm-1 in a MOF-5 structure. \n\nHowever, it was reported in studies about ZnO particles that the position of these Zn-O bands \n\nunderlies a strong dependence on shape morphology of the ZnO particles and can appear in a broad \n\nrange between roughly 400 and 500 cm-1.104, 105 In particular, IR spectra exhibited characteristic bands \n\naround 420 cm-1 in correspondence to the here found result. This is also an indication for the \n\ncoexistence of ZnO particles in the here reported thin films. With decreasing deposition temperature \n\nthis absorption evolves to be more intense. This could be related to the different film morphologies \n\n??  \n\n?s \n?as \n\n\n\n \n\nRESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION 77 \n\nthat were shown in SEM images in chapter 8.4.1.1.

Herein, the FTIR analysis is supported by literature findings about \n\nsimilar hybrid structures examining the typical bands of carboxylate stretching vibrations. As matter \n\nof fact, this type of Zn-TP hybrid films can exhibit distinctive properties in contrast to their inorganic \n\ncounterparts due to the inclusion of organic components.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nRESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION 78 \n\n8.4.1.5 UV-Vis of Zn-terephthalate hybrid films \n\nIn Figure 60 the UV-Vis spectra of Zn-TP hybrid films are given that were deposited at 150, 175 and \n\n200 \u00b0C. The graphs were corrected by the absorption contribution of the substrates. For all of them a \n\nsharp absorption edge can be observed from which the bandgap can be determined from a Tauc-plot. \n\nThe intersection of the extrapolated linear regimes with the horizontal axis results in an optical \n\nbandgap Eg?3.2 eV. The ZnO reference film shows a bandgap of around 3.1 eV. These values are in \n\nagreement with the 3.1 to 3.3 eV reported elsewhere for the bandgap of ZnO.106 Apart from the GIXRD \n\nand FTIR results the presented UV-Vis spectra are another clear evidence for the presence of ZnO in \n\nthe hybrid films. Moreover, it can be observed that with decreasing deposition temperature the \n\nabsorption intensity increases. This trend was also observed for the Zn-O absorption bands in the \n\nFTIR analysis in the previous chapter 8.4.1.4 and could be related to the different observed \n\nmorphologies seen in the SEM. Changing optical properties of ZnO thin films with different \n\nmorphologies and textures were also reported by Chiang et al.92 It can also be assumed, that the unclear \n\nreaction mechanism leading to ZnO formation is more pronounced at lower temperatures. \n\nNevertheless, it remains challenging to provide direct experimental evidence confirming the structural \n\nordering of organic and inorganic moieties in the hybrid thin film. \n\n \n\nFigure 60: UV-Vis spectra for the thin films deposited by DEZ/TPA at the designated temperatures 150, 175 \n\nand 200 \u00b0C on KBr. The spectra are corrected by the substrate contribution. As a reference a ZnO deposited by \n\nH2O/DEZ at 200 \u00b0C is given. \n\n\n\n \n\nRESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION 79 \n\n8.4.2 ALD/MLD by Eu(TMHD)3 and TPA \n\nAs described in the experimental part, this attempt followed closely the previous works from \n\nGiedraityte in which the successful deposition of luminescent, lanthanide hybrid thin films was \n\ndemonstrated on Si(100).52 Although the same precursors Eu(TMHD)3 and TPA and similar process \n\nparameters with even extended precursor pulsing times were utilized, up to now, no hybrid film was \n\nobtained with the here used setup. In SEM images no film deposition, neither on Si(100), Si/SiO2 nor \n\non N-CNTs, was visible and a fluorescence test under UV light (365 nm and 254 nm), being suitable \n\nfor excitation of the Eu absorption, was negative.  \n\nThe work by Giedraityte shows the principle feasibility of this precursor combination leading to \n\namorphous hybrid films. Nevertheless, a challenge of this system are to evaporate sufficient amounts \n\nof two solid precursors and transporting them through the gas tubing into the reactor chamber where \n\nthey have to react. Thus, a fundamental issue, e.g. a lack of gaseous precursor arriving to the substrate \n\nsurface, can be assumed and could explain that no film formation was observed. As the previous \n\nexperiments using TPA (chapter 8.4.1) were successful, the issues seem to be related to the evaporation \n\nand transport of the Eu(TMHD)3 precursor.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSUMMARY 81 \n\n9 Summary \n\nIn a first theoretical part of this work an introduction into ALD and MLD was given. Then, recent \n\nadvances in the application of vapor-based synthesis methods for inorganic-organic hybrids, and in \n\nparticular MOFs, were reviewed and motivations explained. In summary of this review, two decades \n\nwith mostly solution based approaches towards MOF formation have been able to synthesize a large \n\nvariety of different structures with manifold applications in wide-spanning fields from gas adsorption \n\nto biomedical usage in drug release. Furthermore, a key trend is seen in the microelectronic industry \n\nfor device integration of organic-inorganic hybrid materials like MOFs. According to this, roadmaps \n\nhave been formulated in 2011 and have recently been updated in 2017.3, 31 However, the important step \n\ntowards implementation of these hybrid materials could not be adequately addressed by conventional, \n\nsolution-based synthesis routes. Vapor-phase techniques, such as ALD/MLD, have therefore caught \n\ngreat attention and are seen as the key to answer the high demands of the electronic industry. \n\nRemarkable first attempts have been already done and were reviewed here30, 35, 36, but this research is \n\njust in the beginning phase and needs much feasibility assessment in finding well-behaving precursor \n\npairs, understanding of process parameters and growth mechanisms in the field of organic-inorganic \n\nhybrid thin films. The step towards crystalline organic-inorganic hybrid structures has only been \n\nreported by a handful of publications. Therefore this topic offers great research potential and, in \n\nparticular, for finding a direct ALD/MLD route towards MOFs. \n\n \n\nIn the experimental part of this work, firstly, a step back to ALD deposition of purely inorganic ZnO \n\nwas done. The common precursors H2O and diethylzinc (DEZ) were utilized. These early stage \n\nexperiments had a learning process as primary objective. A fundamental understanding of the ALD \n\ntechnique was obtained by a well-established system and first experience with the here used, home-\n\nbuilt ALD reactor was gathered. Eventually, ZnO deposition was demonstrated on various substrates, \n\nsuch as flat Si(100) wafers or the more complex geometries of nitrogen-doped multi-walled carbon \n\nnanotubes (N-MWCNTs). Hence, the ability of ALD to produce conformal coatings and the \n\ncompatibility with the high demands of the microelectronic industry were shown. The evolution of \n\nZnO film growth for different ALD cycles was imaged by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and \n\nthe growth-per-cycle (GPC) of the process was deduced from thickness measurements by means of X-\n\nray Reflectivity (XRR). A GPC of 1.9 \u00c5 was found to be in excellent accordance to literature results. \n\nHomogeneous ZnO film composition was shown in elemental mappings by Energy-Dispersive X-ray \n\nSpectroscopy (EDX). Furthermore, a structural analysis of the polycrystalline thin films was \n\nconducted by Grazing Incidence X-ray Diffraction (GIXRD) and obtained typical diffraction patterns \n\nof the hexagonal wurtzite structure with lattice parameters of a = 3.25 \u00b1 0.03 \u00c5 and c = 5.21 \u00b1 0.04 \u00c5. \n\nThe films deposited at 100 \u00b0C showed no preferential grain orientation. However, it was found in \n\nliterature that control over the film morphology and growth of textured films is possible by variation \n\n\n\n \n\nSUMMARY 82 \n\nof the deposition temperature. Driven by the interest of the opto-electronic industry a lot of studies \n\nexist to tune the optical properties of ZnO thin films. Peak width analysis of the GIXRD diffractograms \n\nand application of the Scherrer equation yielded a crystallite size of around 15 nm. Finally, a RMS film \n\nroughness of 7.4 nm was determined from AFM measurements (5 \u00b5m x 5\u00b5m image). Besides the ZnO \n\ndeposition on Si(100), the conformal coating of N-CNTs was observed in SEM and Scanning \n\nTransmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) images.  \n\n \n\nAfter the successful ZnO deposition experiments it was returned to the initial aim of this work, that is \n\nto demonstrate a vapor-phase route for the synthesis of a MOF. In a first attempt, and following the \n\npioneering work of Stassen et al.,30 the previously acquired ZnO thin films were now exposed to HMIM \n\nvapor with the objective to initiate a solid-vapor transformation into ZIF-8. Several vapor treatments \n\ninside the ALD reactor were tested by evaporating solid HMIM in the heated canisters and injecting \n\nthe HMIM vapor into the reactor chamber onto the ZnO samples in a sequential manner. Even longer \n\ntreatment durations up to 80 min compared to the 30 min reported by Stassen, exposure temperatures \n\nup to 130 \u00b0C and humid conditions, that were proposed to facilitate the transformation, did not lead to \n\nan evidence for a vapor-solid reaction in SEM, EDX, Raman and GIXRD studies. It was emphasized \n\nthat the continuous MOF-CVD character by direct gas exposure from a HMIM powder bed as \n\nreported by Stassen could not be reproduced by the sequential exposure character, given the here used \n\nALD reactor. In another attempt the bottom-up formation of ZIF-8 by a sequential ALD/MLD \n\nprocess with the precursors DEZ as Zn source and HMIM for the imidazolate linkages was studied. \n\nTo our knowledge this route has not been reported before for ZIF-8 and the capability of the used \n\nreactor for sequential precursor injection and hence an ALD/MLD route in contrast to the MOF-\n\nCVD route seemed more suitable. Nevertheless, the attempted deposition on N-CNTs showed only \n\nminor signs for nucleation in an STEM/EDX analysis, but no significant film deposition. Raman \n\nspectroscopy for deposition trials on N-CNTs and Si(100) yielded no characteristic bands apart from \n\nthe substrate signals. In conclusion, both routes towards a ZIF-8 MOF did not the lead to the aspired \n\ngoal. \n\n \n\nFurthermore, the direct ALD/MLD deposition of terephthalate (TP) thin films was targeted like it \n\nhad already been demonstrated before by Karppinen et al., for crystalline Cu-TP (MOF-2), Ca-TP and \n\nLi-TP films. In this work, it was aimed at Zn-TP thin films deposited by the precursors diethylzinc \n\n(DEZ) and terephthalic acid (TPA). Potentially, growth of a MOF structure could have been expected \n\ngiven the precursors that contain the MOF-5 components for Zn nodes and terephthalate linkers. A \n\nhigh film growth rate of about 6.5 \u00c5/cycle at 200 \u00b0C deposition temperature was observed by film \n\nthickness measurements from a SEM cross-section. Evidence for organic-inorganic linkage between \n\nthe terephthalate and Zn of bridging type was proven in FTIR measurements and demonstrated the \n\nhybrid nature of the film. However, peaks at low 2? angles below 20\u00b0, that would be typical for a MOF-\n\n\n\n \n\nSUMMARY 83 \n\n5 or related hybrid structure, were not observed in GIXRD. Interestingly, the as-deposited Zn-TP \n\nfilm contained crystalline ZnO as proven by GIXRD measurements. The presence of ZnO in the films \n\nwas further proven by the appearance of Zn-O stretching bands in FTIR spectra and an absorption \n\nedge in UV-Vis indicating a ZnO bandgap at 3.2 eV. Assumably, the deposited thin films are hybrid \n\nlayers of amorphous Zn-TP hybrid and ZnO nanocrystallites and could be understood as a \n\nnanocomposite, but the exact structural ordering of organic and inorganic components remains a \n\nchallenge. For further clarification, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) could reveal the chemical \n\nbonding states. Moreover, Rutherford backscattering (RBS) or nuclear reaction analysis (NMR) were \n\nused by Mai et al.,53 to determine the composition of ALD/MLD hybrid films. \n\n \n\nFinally, ALD/MLD thin film deposition with the precursors Eu(TMHD)3 and TPA was attempted. \n\nUp to now, no film deposition could be observed and showing once more that simple film formation in \n\nvapor-phase synthesis is already a huge challenge for the experimental setup. Anyhow, previous works \n\nby other authors using these precursors are promising and, prospectively, thin film deposition of \n\nluminescent lanthanide containing hybrids, e.g. LnMOFs, is an ultimate goal that should be targeted \n\nin further studies. For this, upgrades of the home-built ALD reactor for better evaporation and \n\ntransport of the precursors to the reactor chamber might be needed, as well as setup improvements for \n\nhigher working temperatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCONCLUSION &amp; OUTLOOK 85 \n\n10 Conclusions &amp; Outlook \n\nThe main achievement of this work is a review of the current state of vapor-based processing of \n\norganic-inorganic hybrids, and potentially MOFs, referring to recent publications in this very young \n\nresearch field. It was emphasized on the already existing expertise of some leading groups for handling \n\nALD/MLD for several systems of hybrid thin films. In this sense, the activities of the Karppinen group \n\nhave to be highlighted and were taken as a role model for this work several times and show the \n\nimportance of a year-long experience in ALD/MLD and deep understanding of the chemistry behind.  \n\n \n\nThe development of models for reaction mechanisms will be an important step to control the formation \n\nof hybrid structures from the vapor phase. It has to be pointed out that the challenge emerges from \n\nthe fundamental difference of vapor phase methods compared to liquid phase methods, in which many \n\norganic reactions are catalysed by acid, base or solvation effects. These necessary mechanisms are \n\nabsent in a gas phase environment and make self-assembly processes difficult. Furthermore, it can be \n\nassumed that the vapor deposition leads to collapsed structures as frameworks are not stabilized during \n\nthe layer-by-layer formation in ALD/MLD sequences. Organic linkers might bend and prevent an \n\nordered bottom-up formation of a crystalline structure. However, it was discussed in this work, that \n\nliquid-like mobilization layers induced by humid environments could also play a role for vapor phase \n\ndeposition methods. \n\n \n\nVarious experimental approaches based on several precursor combinations have been undertaken in \n\nthis work. However, no crystalline, porous MOF could be synthesized as initially targeted for this \n\nproject. It will be interesting to see in the future if direct vapor-phase processes can be mastered in a \n\ncontrolled manner for a wide range of hybrid thin films, such as superlattices, luminescent coatings or \n\ncrystalline, porous MOF structures. In particular, the class of lanthanide MOFs by choice of well \n\nadapted organic linkers as luminescence sensitizers is highly promising. The establishment of an \n\nALD/MLD route for high quality films could steer towards device integration of hybrid materials \n\nwith manifold applications in micro- and optoelectronics. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nLITERATURE 87 \n\nLiterature \n\n1.
