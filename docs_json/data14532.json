O aumento dos n\u00edveis de \nradia\u00e7\u00e3o UVB (280-320 nm) constitui uma amea\u00e7a particularmente importante \npara as comunidades bacterianas dos sistemas aqu\u00e1ticos, uma vez que a \nradia\u00e7\u00e3o consegue penetrar at\u00e9 profundidades consider\u00e1veis.

However, their small size, short generation time and the fact that their \ngenomes make up a large portion of their cellular volume, make bacteria more \nsusceptible to environmental changes than higher organisms. Increased UVB \nradiation (280-320 nm) levels pose a particularly important threat to bacterial \ncommunities in aquatic systems, due to the ability of radiation to penetrate to \nconsiderable depths. However, the mechanisms of UV-induced damage to \nbacteria are still not clear, preventing the accurate modelling of the effects of \nUV radiation on natural bacterial communities. Located at the sunlit surface \nmicrolayer (SML, top millimetre of the water column), bacterioneuston is \nnaturally exposed to higher levels of UV radiation than the bacterioplankton \nbellow. Therefore, the SML can be viewed as a model ecological niche to study \nthe interaction between bacteria and UV radiation. \n\nThe objectives of this work were (i) to study the influence of the light history of \nbacterial communities in their UV sensitivity, by comparing the photobiological \nresponses of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton; (ii) to gain further insights \ninto the mechanisms of UV-induced damage, as well as the factors that affect \nthe interaction between UV radiation and bacteria; and (iii) to assess the \npotential role of the SOS response mediator RecA protein as a marker of UV-\ninduced damage in bacteria.  \n\nBacterioneuston was found to be more resistant to UVB radiation than \nbacterioplankton and to recover more efficiently from UV-induced damage, \nparticularly under nutrient depleted conditions, thus indicating that the light \nhistory of bacterial communities influences their UV sensitivity. Results from \nculture-independent analysis suggest that UV radiation can affect bacterial \ncommunity structure by selecting for UV-resistant bacteria. UV radiation was \nalso found to modify the functioning of bacterial communities, as indicated by \nsole-carbon-source use profiling with Biolog EcoPlatesTM, as well as leucine \nand thymidine incorporation measurements. The results obtained indicate the \npossibility that bacterioneuston may contain a pool of UV resistant strains that, \nunder appropriate meteorological conditions, may be selected for upon UV \nexposure.  \n\nBy measuring the effects of UV radiation of different wavelengths in bacterial \nabundance, activity, as well as several oxidative stress markers (ROS \ngeneration, DNA strand breakage, lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation), \nsurvival under UVA (320-400 nm), UVB and UVC (100-280 nm) wavelengths \nwas found to be best explained by the extent of DNA damage, oxidative \ndamage to lipids, and intracellular ROS levels, respectively.  \n\n\n\nxiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nxv \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n Additionally, mid-infrared spectroscopy revealed an array of oxidative, \ncompositional and structural modifications in the lipids and proteins of bacteria \nfollowing irradiation. \n\nSinglet oxygen was found to play a pivotal role in UVB-induced cell inactivation, \npotentially due to its effects in lipid peroxidation, as revealed by using specific \nROS scavengers. Metal amendment, particularly with iron, copper and \nmanganese, was found to enhance bacterial inactivation during UVB exposure, \nthus suggesting that metal homeostasis during irradiation is crucial to attenuate \nthe detrimental effects of ROS. Experiments with bacterial strains grown at \ndifferent temperatures (15 \u00baC and 25 \u00baC), growth phases (exponential and \nstationary) and growth media (nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor) revealed that \ngrowth conditions preceding irradiation are pivotal in determining the extent of \nthe oxidative damage induced by UVB exposure. The abiotic environment \n(nutrient content and quality of the suspension medium) of bacterial \ncommunities was also found to influence their UVB sensitivity. \n\nThe study of the phylogeny of the RecA protein revealed high coherence with \nthat of the 16S rRNA gene, reflecting high evolutionary conservation of the \nprotein, rather than particular adaptations to stress resistance. Several \nplasmids containing recA homologs not yet reported in the literature were \nidentified, and gene context analysis suggested that plasmid-encoded recA \ngenes could complement the activity of chromosome-encoded recA genes in \nthe bacterial SOS response. \n\nTaken together, the results obtained in the present work provide new insights \ninto the environmental photobiology of bacterial communities. New information \nregarding the mechanisms and factors influencing the inhibitory effects of UV \nradiation on bacteria was also acquired. This information may contribute for a \nbetter understanding of the interaction between UV radiation and bacteria in the \ncontext of environmental changes, as well as the development of more efficient \nUV-based disinfection technologies. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nxvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nxvii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that if you wiped all multicellular life-forms off the face of \n\nthe Earth, microbial life might shift a tiny bit; if microbial life were to \n\ndisappear, that would be it - instant death for the planet.\u201d \n\n \n\n \n\nCarl Woese, The New York Times, 1996 \n\n \n\n\n\nxviii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nxix \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nStress induzido por UV no bacterioneuston: \nmecanismos e implica\u00e7\u00f5es ecol\u00f3gicas \n\n \nUV-induced stress in bacterioneuston:  \n\nmechanisms and ecological implications \n \n\n\n\nxx \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nxxi \n\n \n\nList of Original Publications \n\nThis thesis includes results which have already been published in the journals listed \n\nbelow:  \n\nSantos, A.

However, information on the comparative responses of bacterioneuston and \n\nbacterioplankton to UV radiation are still scarce in the literature. Likewise, information \n\non the mechanisms that are initiated at the cellular level upon exposure to UV radiation, \n\nparticularly the more biologically relevant UVB (280-320 nm), in different bacteria is \n\nalso absent from the literature, preventing a thorough understanding of the \n\nconsequences of UV radiation to natural bacterial communities, as well as the \n\ndevelopment of more efficient UV-based disinfection technologies. This work aimed to \n\naddress this lack of information.  \n\nIn Chapter 1 a brief contextualization of the known mechanisms of UV-induced \n\ncellular damage and protection/repair, the role of UVR as a driver of the functioning \n\nand structure of bacterial communities and the relevance of bacterioneuston in \n\nenvironmental photobiology studies is presented.  \n\nChapter 2 addresses the comparative effects of UVB radiation on the structure and \n\nfunction of bacterioneuston inhabiting the SML and bacterioplankton inhabiting \n\nunderlying waters (UW). The results revealed that bacterial abundance and DNA \n\nsynthesis were more affected in bacterioplankton, while protein synthesis was more \n\ninhibited in bacterioneuston. UVB exposure led to a reduction in ribotype diversity, \n\ndemonstrating the potential of UVR to affect community structure, probably by \n\nselecting UV-resistant bacteria most notably belonging to Gammaproteobacteria, \n\nparticularly abundant in bacterioneuston. These observations raise the hypothesis that \n\n\n\nThesis Outline \n\n12 \n\nbacterioneuston may contain a pool of UV-resistant strains that are selected for upon \n\nUV exposure.  \n\nThe comparative analysis of the UV responses of bacterioneuston and \n\nbacterioplankton is extended in Chapters 3 and 4 which describe the isolation of UVB-\n\nresistant bacterial strains from both communities that were then tested for their \n\nindividual UVB sensitivity. Bacterial numbers were more reduced by UVB in \n\nbacterioplankton, while leucine incorporation was more inhibited in bacterioneuston. \n\nUVB irradiation was accompanied by a shift in sole-carbon source use profiles, assessed \n\nwith Biolog EcoPlatesTM, characterized by a reduction in consumption of amines and \n\namino acids and increased use of polymers, particularly in bacterioneuston isolates. \n\nRecovery from UV-induced damage under starvation was generally enhanced compared \n\nto nourished conditions, especially in bacterioneuston isolates.  \n\nChapter 5 describes the study of the wavelength dependence of UV-induced \n\ncellular damage in a set of bacterial isolates, used as tentative biological models. \n\nBiological effects (survival and activity) and molecular markers of oxidative stress \n\n(DNA strand breakage, generation of reactive oxygen species [ROS], oxidative damage \n\nto proteins and lipids, and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase and \n\nsuperoxide dismutase) were quantified and statistically analyzed in order to identify the \n\nmain determinants of cell inactivation under the different wavelengths. The reduction in \n\nsurvival and activity was stronger for shorter wavelengths, as expected. DNA damage \n\nfollowed the same pattern. The generation of ROS, as well as protein and lipid \n\noxidation, showed the inverse trend. Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that \n\nsurvival under UVA, UVB and UVC wavelengths was best explained by DNA damage, \n\noxidative damage to lipids, and intracellular ROS levels, respectively. The wavelength \n\ndependence of biomolecule damage was further investigated by mid-infrared \n\nspectroscopy analysis of the effects of irradiation on the proteins and lipids of two \n\nrepresentative bacterial isolates in Chapters 6. Mid-infrared spectroscopy was proven \n\nto be an excellent tool to study changes in bacterial components upon UV exposure, \n\nrevealing an array of modifications in the lipids and proteins of bacteria following \n\nirradiation and providing critical clues to drive future studies concerning the \n\nmechanisms involved in the inactivation of bacteria by UV irradiation. \n\nIn Chapter 7, the investigation of the identity and targets of ROS produced during \n\nUVB exposure in a set of isolates displaying different UV susceptibilities is addressed. \n\nFor that, specific exogenous ROS scavengers (catalase [CAT], superoxide dismutase \n\n\n\nThesis Outline \n\n13 \n\n[SOD], sodium azide and mannitol) were used. Biological effects were assessed from \n\ncolony counts and heterotrophic activity (glucose uptake and respiration). DNA strand \n\nbreakage, ROS generation and oxidative damage to proteins and lipids were used as \n\nmarkers of oxidative stress. Sodium azide conferred a statistically significant protection \n\nin terms of survival and lipid oxidation, suggesting that singlet oxygen might play a \n\npivotal role in UVB-induced cell inactivation. Mannitol exerted a significant protection \n\nagainst DNA strand breakage and protein carbonylation, assigning hydroxyl radicals to \n\nDNA and protein damage. The addition of exogenous CAT and SOD significantly \n\nprotected the capacity of the cells for glucose uptake and respiration, suggesting that \n\nimpairment of metabolic activity during UVB exposure has a contribution of superoxide \n\nand hydrogen peroxide.  \n\nChapter 8 reports the investigation of the role of transition metals (cobalt, copper, \n\niron, manganese, zinc) in UVB-induced damage to bacterial isolates. In general, UVB \n\nirradiation of metal-amended cell suspensions, particularly those with iron, copper and \n\nmanganese, contributed synergistically to enhance bacterial inactivation. Amendment \n\nwith iron exacerbated ROS generation, DNA damage and oxidative damage to lipids \n\nduring irradiation. Additionally, lipid damage during UVB exposure was also enhanced \n\nafter incubation with copper and cobalt. Despite attenuating the formation of protein \n\ncarbonyls during irradiation, manganese decreased survival during irradiation. The \n\nresults indicate that iron, copper, cobalt and manganese play a role in UVB-induced \n\ninactivation and that metal homeostasis may be crucial in limiting oxidative stress \n\nduring UVB exposure. \n\nChapter 9 analyzes the influence of nutrients and water properties in the UVB-\n\nsensitivity of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton, as well as in a set of representative \n\nbacterial strains. UVB-induced inhibition was generally attenuated upon inoculation in \n\nhigh nutrient medium, compared to unamended conditions. Under low nutrient \n\nconditions, bacterioneuston was less affected by UVB exposure than bacterioplankton \n\nin marine samples. For brackish water samples, nutrient conditions did not substantially \n\naffect inactivation, but a high nutrient concentration attenuated the reduction in activity. \n\nResuspension in natural surface or subsurface estuarine water attenuated inactivation \n\nduring irradiation, compared to suspensions prepared in an artificial mineral solution. \n\nThese results indicate that the biological consequences of UV exposure are influenced \n\nby the composition of the suspension medium. Accordingly, the abiotic environment of \n\n\n\nThesis Outline \n\n14 \n\nthe surface microlayer and underlying water potentially influences the UV sensitivity of \n\nbacterioneuston and bacterioplankton, respectively. \n\nChapter 10 describes the influence of growth conditions, in particular, growth \n\nphase (mid-exponential, late-exponential and stationary), growth temperature (15 \u00baC and \n\n25 \u00baC) and growth medium (nutrient-rich TSB and nutrient-poor M9) in UVB-induced \n\ncellular damage in a representative bacterial strain. In general, oxidative damage did not \n\nfollow a linear dose-dependent variation, suggesting a dynamic interaction between \n\ndamage induction and repair, particularly at high UVB doses, and/or saturation of \n\noxidative damage. Stationary phase cells usually survived better and showed lower \n\nlevels of oxidative damage than exponential phase cells. Oxidative damage, most \n\nnotably in mid-exponential phase cells, was generally higher at 25 \u00baC than at 15 \u00baC, \n\nsuggesting that ROS generation and/or ROS interaction with the cellular targets is \n\ntemperature-dependent. Survival during UVB exposure was generally higher when cells \n\nwere grown in nutrient-rich media, than under nutrient-deprived conditions. Growth \n\nconditions might influence bacterial UVB sensitivity by affecting the temporal \n\nprogression and magnitude of biomolecule damage. \n\nChapter 11 examines the diversity of RecA proteins among completely sequenced \n\nbacterial genomes and the reliability of the recA gene as a molecular marker. The \n\npresence of multiple RecA copies in sequenced genomes and the frequency of plasmid-\n\nencoded recA genes were also examined. Phylogenetic analysis of the RecA protein \n\nrevealed, in general, support for the phyla defined by 16S rRNA gene analysis. recA \n\ngene trees of Deltaproteobacteria and Firmicutes were in general agreement with 16S \n\nrRNA trees, but were more divergent in Gammaproteobacteria. Duplication of the recA \n\ngene was found to be a widespread feature in myxobacteria and frequent among \n\nFirmicutes. Sequence analysis revealed that the extra recA copy could, in some cases, \n\nhave resulted from an endogenous duplication event. In other cases, divergence of the \n\nG+C content of the recA gene and the genome raises the possibility of horizontal \n\ntransfer of the additional gene. The presence of recA homologs in plasmids and, in some \n\ncases, the presence of transposases in the vicinity of recA genes could support the \n\npossibility of plasmid-mediated mobility of the recA gene. Gene context analysis \n\nsuggested that these plasmid-encoded recA genes could complement the activity of the \n\nchromosomal recA in the bacterial SOS response. \n\nChapter 12 briefly discusses the main results of this work in an integrated \n\nperspective. Chapter 13 is a general conclusion of the thesis. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n15 \n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\nIntroduction \n\nUV radiation \n\nUltraviolet (UV) radiation (100-400 nm) corresponds to the region of the \n\nelectromagnetic spectrum located between visible light and X-rays (Iqbal, 1983) and, as \n\na natural component of sunlight, it is part of the environment in which life evolved and \n\nto which it adapted. UV radiation has been proposed to be involved in the evolution of \n\nDNA base composition and sequence (Lesk, 1973; Boulikas, 1992), the ecology, \n\nbiochemistry and evolution of the first life forms (Sagan, 1973) and the pattern of early \n\nevolution (Walker et al., 1976). The importance of solar UV radiation as an \n\nevolutionary driving force is reflected by the development of several protection \n\nmechanisms against the deleterious biological effects of UV radiation, including several \n\npartly redundant enzymatic pathways for the repair of UV-induced DNA damage, very \n\nearly in evolution (DiRuggiero and Robb, 2004). The genotoxic effects of solar UV \n\nradiation are thought to have precluded the development of terrestrial life for two or \n\nthree billion years, before the stratospheric ozone layer was formed. \n\nThe use of sunlight by cells was an achievement of utmost importance for life on \n\nEarth. The Sun not only provided an unlimited source of energy and assured a \n\ndependable supply of food but also drastically changed the Earth\u2019s atmosphere by \n\nhelping to generate molecular oxygen through photosynthesis which, in turn, had a \n\ndramatic influence on the abundance and diversity of life forms on Earth (Falkowski, \n\n2006; Holland, 2006; Payne et al., 2008). The interaction of sunlight with the increasing \n\namounts of accumulating oxygen allowed the formation of the ozone molecule and \n\nsubsequently the ozone layer, approximately 2 billion years ago (Canuto et al., 1982). \n\nThe newly formed ozone layer altered the solar spectrum, preventing high energy \n\nradiation photons (short-wavelength UVC radiation, 100-280 nm) from reaching the \n\nlower troposphere, where life was developing. Once the ozone layer matured, survival \n\nwas no longer dependent on protection against UV radiation by a layer of water or other \n\nphysical shields. Life became possible on the top of the water column and eventually on \n\nthe surface of the land (Goldblatt et al., 2006). \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n16 \n\nDepletion of the ozone layer \n\nThe first doubts about the effectiveness of the stratospheric ozone layer in \n\nprotecting the Earth\u2019s surface from damaging solar wavelengths raised upon the \n\nobservation of a latitudinal gradient in skin cancer incidence, correlating with UV \n\nradiation incidence (Urbach, 1969). In 1985, a paper published in Nature surveying the \n\nvariation in total column ozone over the Antarctic for four seasons, unequivocally \n\ndescribed massive ozone losses during the spring (Farman et al., 1985), an event which \n\nwas latter dubbed as the \u201cozone hole\u201d. Further analysis of the ozone records retrieved \n\nfrom scientific bases in the Antarctic demonstrated a trend for decreasing thickness of \n\nthe ozone layer since the 1970s, progressing at increasing rates (Crutzen, 1970). Ozone \n\nloss events were later also observed at mid-latitudes and in the Arctic, although not to \n\nthe same extent as over Antarctica (W.M.O., 1988; W.M.O., 1991). The implications of \n\nmassive ozone depletion stimulated the interest in the mechanisms of ozone degradation \n\nand the biological consequences of increased UV fluxes, particularly UVB (280-320 \n\nnm), the major known outcome of ozone depletion (Nolan and Amanatidis, 1995).  \n\nMolina and Rowland (1974) first proposed that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) \n\nreleased to the atmosphere by human activity were responsible for the depletion of the \n\nozone layer, indisputably associating a global environmental change with anthropogenic \n\nactivity. According to the authors, the photochemical breakdown of CFCs and other \n\nozone-depleting substances (ODSs) in the stratosphere resulted in the release of chlorine \n\n(Cl) and bromine (Br) atoms, which catalyzed the destruction of ozone. The pioneer \n\nwork of Molina and Rowland led to the Nobel Prize for the authors in 1995. \n\nSubsequently, the presence of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) was also identified as \n\nan important catalyst for large ozone loss in Polar Regions, by creating sites on which \n\nfast heterogeneous chemical reactions can occur, rapidly increasing ozone-destroying \n\nmolecules in the stratosphere (Solomon, 1999). \n\nThe early prolific scientific research in the field of ozone depletion culminated in \n\nthe first World Meteorological Organization (WMO)/United Nations Environment \n\nProgram scientific assessment of ozone depletion in 1985 (WMO, 1985), which \n\nprovided the scientific consensus that CFCs and halons posed a critical threat to the \n\nozone layer. In response to the conclusions of the report, the landmark Montreal \n\nProtocol agreement was negotiated in 1987, which regulated the production of CFCs \n\nand other ODSs (Velders et al., 2007). Since 1987, 193 nations have signed the \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n17 \n\nMontreal Protocol leading to a worldwide decrease in the production of ODSs. \n\nAccordingly, the cumulative levels of chlorine and bromine from ODSs in the \n\ntroposphere (Montzka et al., 1996) and stratosphere (Anderson et al., 2000; Froidevaux \n\net al., 2006; M\u00e4der et al., 2010) have shown a decreasing trend. \n\nBased on the reduction of ozone depleting chemicals in the atmosphere, normal \n\nozone levels were initially expected to be restored by around 2050 (Schrope, 2000). \n\nHowever, interactions between stratospheric ozone loss and other observed or potential \n\natmospheric changes associated with global warming are expected to change the \n\ntimeline. For example, increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) levels are responsible for \n\nwarming in the lower atmosphere (i.e., troposphere), but have the opposite cooling \n\neffect on the stratosphere. Ozone loss in itself also cools the stratosphere since less \n\nradiation is absorbed. The cooling of the stratosphere results in an enhanced chance of \n\nPSCs forming and existing for more prolonged periods at high altitudes. This mediates \n\nfurther ozone loss processes, accelerating ozone depletion and cooling the stratosphere \n\neven more in a positive feedback effect. On the other hand, increases in greenhouse gas \n\nconcentrations, by influencing the spatial distribution of ozone and its exchange \n\nbetween the stratosphere and the troposphere, can also potentially affect UV levels \n\nreaching the Earth\u2019s surface (Bais et al., 2011).  \n\nAs a result of the interplay between climate change and changes in UV fluxes \n\nreaching the Earth, the most recent predictions indicate that the UV radiation index is \n\nexpected to decrease by 9 % in northern high latitudes, but to increase by 4 % in the \n\ntropics and by up to 20 % in southern high latitudes in late spring and early summer, up \n\nto the year 2095 (Hegglin and Shepherd, 2009). These changes in tropospheric ozone \n\nbudget and the ultraviolet index will likely have consequences for tropospheric radiative \n\nforcing (Velders et al., 2007), air quality (Wilson et al., 2007; Tang et al., 2011) and \n\nhuman and ecosystem health (Ballar\u00e9 et al., 2011; H\u00e4der et al., 2011; Norval et al., \n\n2011; Zepp et al., 2011; Thomas et al., 2012). Warming, acidification and changes in \n\nocean stratification patterns are also expected to increase the penetration of UV \n\nradiation in the water column and enhance organism exposure to UVB in forthcoming \n\nyears (Andrady et al., 2010). Besides these modelled, predicted effects, unpredicted \n\nevents could also potentially affect the UV radiation index. For example, in 2011, an \n\nunprecedented Arctic ozone loss was recorded as a result of unusually long-lasting cold \n\nconditions in the Arctic lower stratosphere (Manney et al., 2011). Whether such Arctic \n\nozone depletion events may be matched or exceeded in the future, is unknown. These \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n18 \n\nconcerns continue to make the study of the effects of UV radiation on the Earth\u2019s biota a \n\ncritical and timely subject. \n\n \n\nEffects of UV radiation on microorganisms \n\nThe recognition of the involvement of UV radiation as a cause or contributing \n\nfactor for skin cancer and eye cataracts, as well as its connection to the development of \n\nimmune deficiencies, prompted the scientific interest on the biological effects of UV \n\nradiation (Kligman et al., 1985; Kraemer et al., 1987; Kripke, 1988; Taylor et al., 1988). \n\nThe detrimental impact of UV radiation on ecosystem structure and function was also \n\nsoon recognized, and is now known to include decreased primary productivity, altered \n\nspecies composition and potential consequences to biogeochemical cycles and food \n\nproduction (Caldwell et al., 1998; Zepp et al., 1998; Searles et al., 2001; Caldwell et al., \n\n2003; H\u00e4der et al., 2003; Paul and Gwynn-Jones, 2003; Caldwell et al., 2007; H\u00e4der et \n\nal., 2007; Zepp et al., 2007; Ballar\u00e9 et al., 2011; H\u00e4der et al., 2011). \n\nUV radiation can be a particularly important selective force in aquatic systems, \n\nsince radiation can penetrate to considerable depths (Fleischmann, 1989; Smith, 1989; \n\nWorrest and H\u00e4der, 1989; Smith et al., 1992; Tedetti and Semp\u00e9r\u00e9, 2006). For example, \n\nin the subtropical open Atlantic, the 10 % radiation level for 320 nm, 340 nm and 380 \n\nnm wavelengths is at &lt;25, 35 and 60 m deep, respectively (Obernosterer et al., 1999) \n\nand UV penetration has been detected to a depth of 70 m in Antarctica (Smith et al., \n\n1992). Early studies focused on the UV sensitivity responses of phytoplankton, due to \n\nits contribution to the primary productivity of ecosystems (Smith et al., 1980; Smith, \n\n1989; Karentz et al., 1991; Helbling et al., 1992; Behrenfeld et al., 1993; Cullen and \n\nNeale, 1994; Helbling et al., 1994; Vernet et al., 1994; H\u00e4der et al., 1995). However, the \n\nshort generation time, simple haploid genomes with little or no functional redundancy \n\nand small size, which might preclude effective cellular shading or protective \n\npigmentation, make bacteria particularly susceptible to UV radiation (Garcia-Pichel, \n\n1994). Considering the role of bacteria in the cycling of nutrients and energy in \n\necosystems (Azam et al., 1983), the knowledge of the effects of UV radiation on \n\nbacterial communities becomes of utmost importance, as demonstrated by the \n\nconsiderable number of reviews covering the effects of UV radiation in both freshwater \n\nand marine systems (H\u00e4der and Worrest, 1991; Karentz, 1994; Siebeck et al., 1994; \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n19 \n\nHerndl et al., 1997; H\u00e4der et al., 1998; Moran and Zepp, 2000; Vincent and Neale, \n\n2000; Whitehead et al., 2000; H\u00e4der, 2001; Buma et al., 2003; H\u00e4der et al., 2003). \n\nIn the natural environment, UVR effects are generally attenuated by protection \n\nand repair strategies (Becker-Hapak et al., 1997; Cabiscol et al., 2000; Tedetti and \n\nSemp\u00e9r\u00e9, 2006). The overall stress imposed by UV exposure thus reflects an \n\nequilibrium between damage, repair and the energetic costs of protection, which may \n\naffect energy consumption and the biochemical composition of the cellular material of \n\nindividuals, ultimately resulting in decreased survival and growth rate (Moriarty, 1986; \n\nVincent and Neale, 2000). Consequences at the organism level can, in turn, affect the \n\nmicrobial community, creating shifts in ecosystem carbon cycles, and in the fluxes of \n\nenergy and nutrients (Schimel et al., 2007). \n\n \n\nMechanisms of UV-induced damage  \n\nAt the cellular level, the toxic effects of UV radiation can be initiated by direct \n\nand indirect photochemical mechanisms (Moriarty, 1986; Vincent and Neale, 2000). \n\nThe direct mechanism involves the absorption of UV photons by chromophores present \n\nin certain biomolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids. Upon UV absorption, these \n\nmolecules are photochemically degraded or transformed, resulting in impairment or \n\neven loss of biological function. The indirect mechanism involves the absorption of UV \n\nphotons by a photosensitizer molecule inside or outside the cell (namely flavins, \n\nporphyrins, quinones, protein-bound tryptophan and also humic compounds present in \n\nenvironmental samples) (Curtis et al., 1992; Davies-Colley et al., 1994). Upon \n\nexcitation, the photosensitizer is able to transfer energy in two different ways, often \n\ncalled type I and type II mechanisms (Foote, 1987; Foote, 1991). In the type I process, \n\nthe electronically excited sensitizer reacts directly with the cellular component, \n\nsubtracting one electron or hydrogen atom from the cellular target, resulting in the \n\nformation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including free radicals (e.g., superoxide \n\nions and hydroxyl radicals) which initiate free-radical chain reactions. The type II \n\nmechanism involves energy transfer from the sensitizer to molecular oxygen with the \n\nconsequent formation of an excited state of oxygen, singlet oxygen, which can then \n\nattack biomolecules (H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, 1987).  \n\nIn the case of the direct pathway, the magnitude of the damage caused by UV \n\nexposure is determined by the amount of radiation absorbed and the quantum yield of \n\nphotodestruction (i.e., the number of molecules damaged per photon absorbed), which \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n20 \n\nin turn depends on the incident UV wavelength (Moriarty, 1986; Vincent and Neale, \n\n2000). UVR can be divided in three wavelength ranges: UVA (320-400 nm), UVB \n\n(280-320 nm) and UVC (100-280 nm). Although, on a proton basis, UVA radiation \n\ncontains less energy than UVB radiation, the greater fraction of solar UV radiation in \n\nthe UVA (95 %) spectrum than in the UVB spectrum (5 %) makes it a potentially \n\nsignificant source of biological damage (Moan et al., 1999). DNA absorbs only weakly \n\nat longer UV wavelengths (Wells and Han, 1984). Therefore, the biological effects of \n\nUVA are usually considered to be mostly indirect, resulting from intracellular \n\ngeneration of ROS which cause oxidative damage to lipids, proteins and DNA (Tyrrell, \n\n1973; Girotti, 1985; Chamberlain and Moss, 1987; Girotti, 1998; Pattison and Davies, \n\n2006). The UVB component of solar radiation can directly induce the formation of \n\nDNA lesions that block DNA replication and RNA transcription and, left unrepaired, \n\nlead to cell death (Mitchell and Karentz, 1993). UVB-induced damage can also arise \n\nfrom increased production of intracellular ROS upon irradiation, as suggested by the \n\nenhanced expression of ROS scavenging systems following irradiation (Qiu et al., 2004; \n\nMatallana-Surget et al., 2009a; Di Capua et al., 2011). The resulting damage can be \n\neven more detrimental than the direct effects of UV radiation, since oxidative lesions \n\nare energetically expensive to prevent and very resource intensive to repair (Halliwell \n\nand Gutteridge, 1999; Lister et al., 2010).  \n\nAlthough almost entirely screened out by the ozone layer, high-energy UVC \n\nwavelengths remain useful in laboratorial experiments to assess UV sensitivity in \n\nbacteria that are highly tolerant or insensitive to elevated doses of UVB (Sundin and \n\nJacobs, 1999). Additionally, UVC wavelengths are also well known for their potential \n\nto inactivate microorganisms in several settings, including hospitals (Andersen et al., \n\n2006), the pharmaceutical/medical industry (Rastogi et al., 2007), water treatment plants \n\n(H\u00f8ibye et al., 2008) and food products (Chun et al., 2009; Sommers et al., 2009). \n\n \n\nReactive oxygen species and the importance of metals \n\nThe autoxidation of flavoenzymes (e.g., succinate dehydrogenase, fumarate \n\nreductase, NADH dehydrogenase I and II, glutamate synthase, lipoamide \n\ndehydrogenase, and sulfite reductase) is a key biological source of both superoxide \n\n(O2\n?-) and H2O2 in the cell (Imlay, 2008; Spiro and D'Autreaux, 2012). Superoxide \n\ntoxicity arises from its ability to directly oxidize and inactivate proteins containing iron-\n\nsulphur (4Fe-4S) clusters (e.g., aconitases, fumarases, serine dehydratase, threonine \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n21 \n\ndeaminase, isopropylmalate isomerase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase). The reaction \n\nresults in inactive [3Fe-4S] clusters and releases free iron ions [Fe2+] and H2O2, which \n\ncan participate in Fenton and Haber-Weiss oxidative reactions that generate the potent \n\nhydroxyl radical (OH?) (see below). Superoxide can also participate in lipid \n\nperoxidation (Thomas et al., 1985).  \n\nWhile H2O2 is poorly reactive compared to other ROS, its long half-life and \n\ncapability to diffuse across the cell membranes makes it significant in oxidative stress. \n\nH2O2 can also be produced as a result of the catalytic activity of superoxide dismutase \n\n(SOD) (McCord and Fridovich, 1969; Imlay, 2008) and from the photooxidation of \n\ntryptophan (McCormick et al., 1976). H2O2 is able to directly oxidize and inactivate the \n\niron-sulphur clusters of key enzymes. H2O2 can also react with the intracellular pool of \n\nincorporated ferrous iron and thereby generate the highly reactive hydroxyl radical. As a \n\nconsequence of its reactions with iron, H2O2 interferes with iron homeostasis and \n\nmetabolism, diminishing the delivery of iron into new metalloproteins (Valko et al., \n\n2006; Imlay, 2008). \n\nThe hydroxyl radical (OH?) is highly reactive with a half-life in aqueous \n\nsolution of less than 1 ns (Liochev and Fridovich, 2002). The majority of hydroxyl \n\nradicals are produced from H2O2 and superoxides in a Haber-Weiss reaction (Bast et al., \n\n1991; Kehrer, 2000; Koppenol, 2001): \n\nH2O2 + O2\n?- ? O2 + OH\n\n- + OH? \n\nor in a transition metal-catalyzed Fenton reaction, involving Fe2+: \n\nFe2+ + H2O2 ? Fe\n3+ + OH- + OH? \n\nOther metals, like Cu+ and Co2+, can also favour the generation of the hydroxyl \n\nradical but, since they are only present in very small amounts in the cell, the reaction is \n\nless favourable (Bucher et al., 1983). Additionally, the hydroxyl radical can also be \n\nformed by metal-independent processes, as a result of the decomposition of \n\nperoxynitrite, an oxidant formed by the combination between nitric oxide and the \n\nsuperoxide radical (Hogg et al., 1992).  \n\nThe extremely short half-life of the hydroxyl radical limits its reactivity to the \n\nimmediate vicinity from where it is formed, such as near iron-sulphur clusters or in \n\nenzymes using iron as a prosthetic metal (Imlay, 2006). Iron bound to DNA can also \n\ncatalyze the formation of the hydroxyl radical which then attacks DNA bases or the \n\ndeoxyribosyl backbone of DNA to produce damaged bases or strand breaks (Imlay et \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n22 \n\nal., 1988). A role for the hydroxyl radical in sunlight-induced damage in Escherichia \n\ncoli has been proposed (Oppezzo, 2012). \n\nAmong different ROS, singlet oxygen (1O2) is the only electronically excited \n\nstate of molecular oxygen. The relatively short lifetime of singlet oxygen (~ 4 \u00b5 s) limits \n\nthe distance it can diffuse in cells and, therefore, restricts its reactivity (Krasnovsky Jr, \n\n1981; Egorov et al., 1989; Baker and Kanofsky, 1992; Gorman and Rodgers, 1992). \n\nSinglet oxygen readily reacts with DNA, lipids (mainly unsaturated fatty acids) and \n\nparticularly with proteins (Davies, 2003; Miyamoto et al., 2007). Upon reaction of \n\namino acids with singlet oxygen, short-lived endo- or hydroperoxides are formed which, \n\nin turn, decompose into reactive radicals in the presence of redox-reactive metal ions \n\nand can cause oxidative damage to other biomolecules (Miyamoto et al., 2007). Singlet \n\noxygen has also been shown to induce the formation of protein carbonyls and modify \n\nthe prosthetic groups of proteins (Davies, 2003). Interaction of singlet oxygen with \n\nunsaturated lipids can form lipid hydroperoxides, which are able to diffuse in cells and \n\ninitiate chain oxidation reactions at sites distant from the site of initial photodamage \n\n(Howden and Faux, 1996). Additionally, in the presence of Fe2+ or Cu+, lipid peroxides \n\nformed as a result of singlet oxygen attack can participate in Fenton-like reactions to \n\nproduce oxy- and peroxy- radicals capable of inducing damage to DNA and proteins \n\n(Nowis and Golab, 2008). Singlet oxygen has been implicated in UVA-induced damage \n\n(Chamberlain and Moss, 1987; Baier et al., 2006). \n\nUnderstanding the role of metals in UVB-induced damage is necessary for a \n\nrealistic perspective of the interaction of bacteria with radiation in a natural context, \n\nwhere these metals can be enriched, particularly when industries and agricultural areas \n\nare located nearby (Zhou et al., 2008). Furthermore, information regarding the \n\ncontribution of metals for UV-induced bacterial inactivation may help develop more \n\nefficient photocatalytic disinfection strategies (Sciacca et al., 2010). \n\n \n\nCellular targets of UV radiation \n\nDNA \n\nThe most notable molecule affected by UV radiation is DNA. The absorbing \n\ncentres within DNA are the purine and pyrimidine bases, which have absorption \n\nmaxima at 260-265 nm (Diffey, 1991). Therefore, UVC and UVB wavelengths are able \n\nto cause direct damage to DNA, in an oxygen-independent manner, while DNA damage \n\nby UVA wavelengths generally arises as a result of photosensitized reactions involving \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n23 \n\nROS (Ravanat et al., 2001; Cadet et al., 2005b). The main lesions induced by UVB and \n\nUVC wavelengths are the DNA photoproducts cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) \n\nand pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4 PPs), resulting from the formation \n\nof covalent bonds between adjacent pyrimidines (Cadet et al., 2005b) (Fig. 1.1). CPDs \n\nare generally produced in higher amounts than 6-4 PPs upon UV irradiation of DNA. \n\nFormation of CPDs under UVA has also been observed (Ikehata et al., 2008). The \n\ngeneration of these lesions by UV radiation is influenced by the DNA sequence. For \n\nexample, sequences that facilitate bending and unwinding are favourable sites for \n\ndamage (Becker and Wang, 1989; Lyamichev, 1991). In bacteria, the distribution of \n\nbipyrimidine photoproducts within UVB-irradiated DNA has also been found to be \n\nprofoundly affected by the G+C content of the genome (Matallana-Surget et al., 2008). \n\nTherefore, the pattern and amount of UV-induced damage to DNA is expected to be \n\nvariable among bacterial strains.  \n\n \nFig. 1.1. Main types of DNA photoproducts resulting from exposure to UVB radiation: cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and \n\npyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4 PPs). CPD formation: upon UV exposure, a bond (red line) is formed between \n\nadjacent thymine (or cytosine) residues (C5 and C6). Since these bonds are shorter than the spacing between the planes of adjacent \n\nthymines, the DNA helix becomes distorted, causing the stalling of the DNA polymerase at the site of the lesion. 6-4 PPs are formed \n\nsimilarly to CPDs, but the covalent bond (red line) is established between the C6 of the 5\u2019 pyrimidine and the C4 of its adjacent 3\u2019 \n\npyrimidine. R = H or CH3 (Maloy et al., 1994). \n\n \n\nOther DNA lesions that can occur to a smaller extent during UVB exposure \n\ninclude photohydration of cytosine, oxidation of guanine into 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine \n\nand the formation of adducts between either two adjacent adenine bases or between \n\nadenine and a vicinal thymine (Cadet et al., 2005b). Additionally, reactive oxygen \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n24 \n\nspecies generated during photosensitized reactions can interact with DNA to form \n\nmodified bases, strand breaks, alkali-labile sites and DNA-protein cross-links (Mitchell, \n\n1995). \n\n \n\nLipids \n\nThe action spectrum for UV effects does not correlate with the absorption \n\nspectrum of lipids. Therefore, UV-induced damage to lipids is likely to be a result of \n\nphotodynamic action (Girotti, 2001). ROS, most notably singlet oxygen, cause damage \n\nto lipids, particularly unsaturated ones, by directly oxidizing their double bonds or by \n\ninitiating a chain of auto-catalyzed reactions of one oxidizing lipid reacting with another \n\n(lipid peroxidation) (Garmyn and Yarosh, 2007). Lipid peroxidation end products, such \n\nas malondialdehyde or 4-hydroxy-nonenal, induce a number of cellular responses, \n\nincluding changes in the electrical properties and ionic permeability of the membrane \n\nand, at higher concentrations, are cytotoxic (Girotti, 1998). Furthermore, these \n\ncompounds can also interact with DNA (Park and Floyd, 1992) and proteins, potentially \n\nleading to loss of protein function (Esterbauer et al., 1991; Stadtman, 1992; Szweda et \n\nal., 1993; Berlett and Stadtman, 1997). \n\n \n\nProteins \n\nThe absorption maximum of proteins in the UV region is at approximately 280 \n\nnm due to absorption by the aromatic amino acids tyrosine (Tyr), phenylalanine (Phe) \n\nand tryptophan (Trp), as well as cysteine (Cys). These proteins can be direct targets of \n\nUVB, which can induce the scission of disulphide bridges between cysteine residues, \n\nimportant for the tertiary structure of many proteins, thus affecting protein structure and \n\nfunction (Creed, 1984). Direct UV photolysis of aromatic amino acids or disulphide \n\nbridges can also cause inactivation of proteins and enzymes, if the affected residues are \n\nincluded in the active site (Holl\u00f3sy, 2002; Pattison and Davies, 2006).  \n\nProteins are also key targets of photosensitized damage, which may cause \n\nfunctional changes in structural and enzymatic proteins. Oxidative reactions may result \n\nin modification of amino acid side chains, fragmentation of polypeptide chains and \n\nintra- and intermolecular cross-linking of proteins and peptides (Nowis and Golab, \n\n2008). Proteins that contain iron as a prosthetic metal are particularly noteworthy targets \n\nof oxidation through Fenton reaction, being readily oxidizable by hydrogen peroxide \n\n(Beyer and Fridovich, 1991; Tamarit et al., 1998; Murakami et al., 2006). Lysine (Lys), \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n25 \n\narginine (Arg), proline (Pro) and threonine (Thr) can be directly oxidized upon the \n\nabsorption of UV radiation by the protein or bound chromophore groups through \n\nphotosensitized reactions (Pattison and Davies, 2006). Upon oxidative attack of Pro, \n\nArg, Lys and Thr, carbonyl (C = O) groups are introduced in the side chains of the \n\nprotein, generating aldehydes or ketone products (Nystr\u00f6m, 2005). Quantitatively, the \n\nmost prominent products of the carbonylation reaction are glutamic semialdehyde from \n\nArg and Pro, and aminoadipic semialdehyde from Lys (Requena et al., 2001). In \n\naddition, carbonyl groups can be introduced into proteins by reaction with reactive \n\ncarbonyl compounds produced by oxidation of carbohydrates and lipids (Nystr\u00f6m, \n\n2005). Protein carbonyl levels have, therefore, been used as a marker of ROS-mediated \n\nprotein oxidation (Dukan and Nystr\u00f6m, 1999; Hoerter et al., 2005a; Nystr\u00f6m, 2005; \n\nDaly et al., 2007; Bosshard et al., 2010b).  \n\n \n\nRepair and protection strategies against UV-induced damage \n\nDNA repair \n\nIn response to UV-induced damage, bacteria have evolved several DNA repair \n\nmechanisms that can essentially be divided in dark repair and light-dependent repair. At \n\nleast three dark repair mechanisms can be found in bacteria that are inducible to a \n\ngreater or lesser extent as a part of the SOS regulon: (1) excision repair, which includes \n\nnucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER); (2) post-replication \n\nrecombinational repair; and (3) error-prone or mutagenic DNA repair (MDR) \n\n(Simonson et al., 1990; Smith and Walker, 1998) (Fig. 1.2 A-C). Nucleotide excision \n\nrepair involves the creation of dual incisions at the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 extremities of the damaged \n\nsite and removal of the section of the DNA containing the lesion, being the resulting gap \n\nsubsequently filled by DNA polymerase, using the complementary strand as a template, \n\nand sealed by DNA ligase (Reardon and Sancar, 2005). In base excision repair, the \n\nenzyme DNA glycosylase removes the damaged or modified DNA base, generating an \n\napurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site which is then excised by an AP endonuclease or an AP \n\nlyase. The remaining deoxyribose phosphate residue is removed by a phosphodiesterase. \n\nThe resulting gap is filled by a DNA polymerase, and the strand is sealed by DNA \n\nligase (Sakumi and Sekiguchi, 1990; Seeberg et al., 1995). Recombinational repair is \n\ninvolved in the repair of double-strand breaks and single-strand breaks in damaged \n\nDNA, which cannot be directly repaired (Shinohara and Ogawa, 1995). In this process, \n\nthe intact parental strand invades the other duplex containing the break allowing the \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n26 \n\nfilling of the gap. The gap that is left in the previously intact strand is then filled by the \n\nDNA polymerase and sealed by DNA ligase (Kuzminov, 1999).  \n\n \nFig. 1.2. Main mechanisms involved in the repair of UV-induced DNA damage. (A) Mutagenic repair, SOS mutagenesis or \n\nerror-prone repair. In this process, a modified DNA polymerase is able to read through damaged DNA, misincorporating \n\nnucleotides in the section of the copy strand opposite the lesion. Mutagenic repair involves the recA, umuD and umuC (organized in \n\nthe umuDC operon) genes. The RecA protein activates the cleavage of UmuD to an active form, UmuD\u2019. While the exact \n\ncontribution of UmuC and UmuD\u2019 to mutagenic repair is still unclear, it seems that the UmuC-UmuD\u2019 complex directly interacts \n\nwith RecA and the stalled DNA polymerase, inhibiting its editing function, thus promoting error-prone replication. (B) \n\nRecombinational repair. During DNA synthesis, the DNA polymerase encounters a DNA lesion and leaves a gap in the copy \n\nstrand opposite the lesion. To repair the gap, RecA-dependent recombination occurs whereby the good template copy strand is \n\ncleaved and invades the gap in the damaged copy strand. A crossover intermediate forms that, after cutting and sealing, results in \n\nfilling the gap with the complementary DNA from the sister strand. The gap formed in the sister strand is filled by the DNA \n\npolymerase and the gaps are sealed by the DNA ligase. The lesion is then remover by nucleotide excision repair or simply diluted \n\nout during growth. (C) Excision repair. The excision repair mechanism is an ATP-dependent, multistep enzymatic process. The \n\nfirst step of the mechanism corresponds to an incision step, which can occur by two mechanisms. In E. coli, a repair endonuclease \n\nrecognizes the distortion of the DNA helix produced by the DNA lesion and makes two cuts (at the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 extremities of the \n\nlesion) in the sugar-phosphate backbone. At the 5\u2019 incision site, a 3\u2019-OH group results which the DNA polymerase uses as a primer \n\nto synthesize a new strand while displacing the DNA segment that carries the lesion. In the final step the newly synthesized segment \n\nis joined to the original strand by DNA ligase. In other systems (e.g., Micrococcus luteus and E. coli phage T4), the incision step \n\noccurs in two distinct stages. In the first step, the N-glycosidic bond is cleaved in the 5\u2019-nucleotide of the dimer. The incision is \n\ncompleted by an endonuclease activity that recognizes a deoxyribose lacking a base. The enzyme makes a single cut at the 5\u2019 side of \n\nthe remaining thymine in the dimer site. The deoxyribose is removed afterwards and the polymerase acts at the new 3\u2019-OH group, \n\ndisplacing the strand and filling the gap. The displaced strand is subsequently excised enzymatically. (D) Light-dependent repair, \n\nphotoenzymatic repair or photoreactivation. In this process, the enzyme DNA photolyase, encoded by the phr gene in E. coli, \n\nreverses the dimerization reaction induced by UV radiation upon absorbing blue light (300-500 nm). The enzyme uses the light \n\nenergy absorbed to cleave the dimers (Maloy et al., 1994; White, 1995). Further details on the photoreactivation mechanism are \n\nprovided in Fig. 1.3. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n27 \n\nMutagenic DNA repair (MDR) involves the activation of low fidelity repair \n\npolymerases, which are able to perform DNA synthesis across damaged regions of \n\nDNA (translesion DNA synthesis) in a template-independent manner, therefore rescuing \n\nstalled replication forks and allowing complete replication of the genome, but carrying \n\nthe cost of an increased mutation rate (Goodman, 2002; Rattray and Strathern, 2003). \n\nMDR-mediated UV tolerance seems to provide a critical ecological advantage for \n\nmicroorganisms inhabiting UV-exposed habitats, such as epiphytic plant pathogens \n\n(Sundin and Murillo, 1999). \n\nIn bacteria, dark repair systems are regulated by the RecA protein. Exposure to \n\nUVA and UVB radiation has been shown to result in increased levels of the RecA \n\nprotein in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Elasri and Miller, 1998), Vibrio natriegens (Booth \n\net al., 2001b) and Photobacterium angustum S14 (Matallana-Surget et al., 2012). Since \n\nRecA levels correlate with the cell\u2019s capacity to repair DNA damage (Miller, 2000), \n\nRecA induction levels have been used as a dosimeter of the repair potential in both \n\nisolates (Booth et al., 2001b) and bacterial communities (Booth et al., 2001a). \n\n \n\n \nFig. 1.3. Catalytic cycle of the repair of bipyrimidine photoproducts by DNA photolyase. The photolyase enzyme contains two types \n\nof cofactors: the redox-active cofactor flavine adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and the light harvesting factor, which can be 5,10-\n\nmethenyltetrahydrofolylpolyglutamate (MTHF) or 8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin (8-HDF). In the repair process, the DNA photolyase \n\nbinds to its substrate. The light harvesting factor (MTHF or 8-HDF) absorbs light (300-500 nm) and the excitation energy is \n\ntransferred to FADH-. The flavin in its excited form (*FADH-) transfers one electron to the pyrimidine dimer, generating a \n\nflavin/substrate radical pair. The excited pyrimidine dimer radical (T<>T*) suffers a bond rearrangement, which results in the \n\ncleavage of the carbon-carbon double bond of the pyrimidine dimer. The electron of the excited dimer is transferred back to the \n\nflavin radical (FADH*). FADH- and a repaired dinucleotide result from the process (Stochel et al., 2009). \n\n \n\nLight-dependent repair, also known as photoenzymatic repair (PER) or \n\nphotoreactivation, depends on the DNA photolyase enzyme that can be activated by \n\nblue light (300-500 nm) (Mitchell, 1995) (Fig. 1.2 D). Photolyases contain two \n\nchromophores, one of which (5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolylpolyglutamate or 8-hydroxy-\n\n5-deazaflavin) harvests light energy, transferring it to a reduced flavin chromophore that \n\nacts as the reaction centre in the reversal of the DNA lesion (Sancar, 1994) (Fig. 1.3). \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n28 \n\nDuring photoenzymatic repair, photolyase binds the DNA lesion (CPDs in the case of \n\nCPD photolyase or 6-4 PPs in the case of the 6-4 PP photolyase), reverses the lesion in \n\na light-dependent step and dissociates from the repaired DNA (Kim et al., 1994; Sancar, \n\n1994; Sancar, 1996; Thoma, 1999).  \n\nThe importance of photoreactivation and dark repair for bacteria has been \n\ndeduced from field and laboratorial studies of the kinetics of formation of DNA \n\nphotoproducts in bacterioplankton (Jeffrey et al., 1996a; Jeffrey et al., 1996b; Meador et \n\nal., 2002). For example, the occurrence of PER in natural bacterial communities has \n\nbeen inferred from analyses of CPD kinetics in bacterioplankton samples obtained from \n\nthe marine water column throughout the solar day (Jeffrey et al., 1996b). Similar field \n\nstudies have also shown a reduction in the amount of CPDs from the day to the night \n\nperiod in bacterioplankton, suggesting that much of the DNA damage induced by UV \n\nexposure during the day is repaired at night, thus indicating that NER is an important \n\nrepair mechanism as well (Lyons et al., 1998; Pakulski et al., 1998).  \n\n \n\nROS scavenging systems \n\nROS are produced abundantly by a variety of metabolic pathways in cells \n\n(Halliwell, 2006). By increasing the activity of oxidases and peroxidases, UV exposure \n\nenhances ROS production in the cell (Apel and Hirt, 2004; Beak et al., 2004). \n\nThroughout the course of evolution, bacteria have evolved several defence mechanisms \n\nagainst oxidative stress, most notably antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide \n\ndismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) (Imlay, 2003).  \n\nSOD is considered to be one of the primary antioxidant defences of the cell, \n\nbecause it catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide (O2\n?-) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), \n\npreventing further generation of free radicals (McCord and Fridovich, 1969). The \n\nresulting H2O2 is then decomposed by CAT to oxygen and water.  \n\nThe radioprotective effect of SOD is conferred not only by its ability to remove \n\nthe potentially dangerous radical superoxide, but also by preventing the redox cycling of \n\nmetals involved in the generation of the hydroxyl radical (Fridovich, 1995). However, \n\nSOD may actually sensitize organisms and enhance oxidative damage since H2O2 \n\n(scavenged by the photosensitive enzyme CAT), resulting from the activity of SOD, is a \n\nmore oxidant species than superoxide (Scott et al., 1989). \n\nLow UVA doses have been shown to result in substantial up-regulation of SOD \n\nactivity (Hoerter et al., 2005a). High catalase activity also seems to play a role in UV \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n29 \n\ntolerance, in some bacterial strains (Di Capua et al., 2011). However, CAT has been \n\nshown to be inactivated by UV radiation (Wood and Schallreuter, 2006). A direct role \n\nof CAT in generating oxidants in response to UVB light has also been proposed (Heck \n\net al., 2003). Therefore, reducing the levels of CAT activity upon exposure to UV \n\nradiation could be a protective mechanism to minimize damage. Decreased enzyme \n\nsynthesis or altered assembly of enzyme subunits have been suggested to account for \n\ndecreased CAT activity upon UV exposure (Hertwig et al., 1992). \n\n \n\nEffects of UVR on bacterial communities \n\nUV radiation affects microorganisms in natural communities both directly and \n\nindirectly. In the microbial loop, bacteria, viruses, phytoplankton and bacterivores \n\ninteract closely (Azam et al., 1983). Therefore, it is expected that if one group of \n\norganisms is directly impacted by UV radiation (e.g., DNA damage) this will indirectly \n\naffect carbon flow through the other groups (Moriarty, 1986; Vincent and Neale, 2000). \n\nFor example, since systems dominated by different phytoplankton communities usually \n\nhave different associated bacterial communities (Pinhassi et al., 2004) and bacterial \n\ncommunities are influenced by phytoplankton exudates (Van Hannen et al., 1999; \n\nRiemann et al., 2000), variations in the light regime that affect phytoplankton will \n\nindirectly influence the bacterial community. Predation by bacterivores is also \n\ninfluenced by UV-radiation which in turn can affect the outcome of UV exposure for \n\nbacteria (Sommaruga et al., 1996; Chatila et al., 1999).  \n\nEffects of UVR on bacteria are also influenced by the photochemical alteration \n\nof the bioavailability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to bacteria by radiation. On the \n\none hand, irradiation of DOC can result in the production of low molecular weight \n\ncompounds that are easily degradable by bacteria, stimulating bacterial growth (Kieber \n\net al., 1989; Wetzel et al., 1995; Bertilsson and Tranvik, 1998). On the other hand, \n\nrefractory products and ROS might also be formed in the process which could exert an \n\noverall inhibitory effect on bacteria (Obernosterer et al., 1999; Tranvik and Bertilsson, \n\n2001). \n\n \n\nEffects on bacterial abundance \n\nDecreased bacterial abundance seems to be a common effect of exposure to solar \n\nUV radiation (M\u00fcller-Niklas et al., 1995; Joux et al., 1999; Maranger et al., 2002; \n\nSinton et al., 2002; Hoerter et al., 2005a; Hoerter et al., 2005b; Berney et al., 2006d; \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n30 \n\nBosshard et al., 2009; Santos et al., 2011a; Santos et al., 2011b; Santos et al., 2012a; \n\nSantos et al., 2012b). Detrimental effects of UV radiation on cell abundance can arise as \n\na result of membrane dysfunction elicited by reactive oxygen species, eventually \n\nleading to increased membrane permeability and cell death (Berney et al., 2006b; \n\nBosshard et al., 2010a). Genomic instability and mutagenesis as a result of UV-induced \n\nDNA damage (Friedberg et al., 2004) can also contribute to decrease cell abundance \n\nduring irradiation. By disrupting the ability of bacteria to properly replicate, \n\ncyclobutane dimers formed upon UV exposure can contribute to the reduction in \n\nbacterial numbers during irradiation, as well (Karentz et al., 1994). Likewise, UV-\n\ninduced lysogeny of virus-infected cells is also a contributing factor for decreased cell \n\nabundance during irradiation (Maranger et al., 2002). Finally, a detrimental effect of the \n\nphotoproducts resulting from DOM (dissolved organic matter) irradiation on bacterial \n\nnumbers has also been found (Ortega-Retuerta et al., 2007). \n\nSome beneficial effects of UVR on bacterial abundance have also been reported \n\n(Lindell et al., 1995; Lindell et al., 1996; Mostajir et al., 1999; Chatila et al., 2001; De \n\nLange et al., 2003), as a result of the release of exudates by UV-stressed phytoplankton \n\nand UV-induced photolysis of high molecular weight DOM into smaller molecules that \n\ncan subsequently be incorporated by bacterioplankton, promoting bacterial growth. \n\nAdditionally, negative effects of UV radiation on bacterivores can also account for \n\nenhanced bacterial numbers upon UV exposure (Sommaruga et al., 1996; Mostajir et al., \n\n1999).  \n\n \n\nEffects on bacterial community structure \n\nVariability in the UV responses and subsequent repair strategies of bacterial \n\nisolates (Joux et al., 1999; Arrieta et al., 2000; Fern\u00e1ndez Zenoff et al., 2006b; Santos et \n\nal., 2011b; Santos et al., 2012a) have been considered indicative of the potential of UV \n\nradiation to affect microbial community structure. However, results on the effects of UV \n\nradiation on bacterial community composition are contrasting, with some studies \n\nreporting only minimal effects of UV radiation on the community structure (Winter et \n\nal., 2001; Norris et al., 2002; Piquet et al., 2010) and others indicating a substantial \n\ndependence of the bacterial community structure on radiation (Langenheder et al., 2006; \n\nDobretsov et al., 2010; Santos et al., 2011a; Manrique et al., 2012; Pajares et al., 2012; \n\nSantos et al., 2012b). UV effects on bacterial community structure may involve the \n\nselection of phototolerant members of the community by radiation. For example, \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n31 \n\nmembers of Gammaproteobacteria have been found to dominate bacterial assemblages \n\nexposed to UV radiation (Alonso-S\u00e1ez et al., 2006; Santos et al., 2012b). Differences in \n\nthe efficiency of the systems involved in the repair of damage induced by UV radiation \n\ncan contribute for the variability in UV sensitivity among different bacteria (Joux et al., \n\n1999; Arrieta et al., 2000; Fern\u00e1ndez Zenoff et al., 2006b; Santos et al., 2011b; Santos \n\net al., 2012a) and help to explain the effects of UV radiation on bacterial community \n\nstructure.  \n\nEffects of UV radiation on bacterial community structure can, in turn, lead to \n\nshifts in the pathways of DOM use by bacteria (Morris et al., 2002), since different \n\nbacterial groups have different susceptibilities to UV radiation and also differ in their \n\nactivities and patterns of DOM utilization (Cottrell and Kirchman, 2000). For example, \n\nAlphaproteobacteria, which are UV-sensitive, are responsible for a large part of low-\n\nmolecular-weight-DOM uptake in the ocean, while Bacteroidetes, considered as more \n\nUV-resistant, are specialized in high-molecular-weight-DOM uptake (Cottrell and \n\nKirchman, 2000; Alonso-S\u00e1ez et al., 2006).  \n\n \n\nEffects on bacterial metabolic activity \n\nField studies have indicate that, in general, exposure to UVR results in a \n\ndecrease in amino acid uptake (Bailey et al., 1983), exoenzymatic activities (Herndl et \n\nal., 1993; M\u00fcller-Niklas et al., 1995; Santos et al., 2011a), oxygen consumption \n\n(Pakulski et al., 1998), leucine and thymidine incorporation (Aas et al., 1996; Lindell et \n\nal., 1996; Jeffrey et al., 1996a; Sommaruga et al., 1997; Visser et al., 2002; Santos et al., \n\n2012b), as well as single-cell activity (Alonso-S\u00e1ez et al., 2006; P\u00e9rez and Sommaruga, \n\n2007; Ruiz-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2012), in bacterioplankton. However, results are sometimes \n\ncontrasting among studies and variable even between bacterial isolates tested in the \n\nsame study (Joux et al., 1999; Arrieta et al., 2000; Fern\u00e1ndez Zenoff et al., 2006b; \n\nH\u00f6rtnagl et al., 2011; Santos et al., 2011b; Santos et al., 2012a).  \n\nMonitoring diel cycles has been frequently used to infer the inhibitory potential \n\nof solar radiation on bacterioplankton activities, particularly leucine and thymidine \n\nincorporation, in the field. Leucine and thymidine incorporation have been found to be \n\ninhibited during the day and recover during the night period (Pakulski et al., 1998; \n\nChr\u00f3st and Faust, 1999; Visser et al., 1999; Visser et al., 2002; Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2007; \n\nVan Wambeke et al., 2009). However, leucine and thymidine incorporation do not seem \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n32 \n\nto follow the same pattern of inhibition and the extent of the photoinhibition of \n\nincorporation can also vary during the day (Pakulski et al., 1998; Visser et al., 2002).  \n\nConclusions on the waveband of the solar spectrum most responsible for the \n\ninhibition of activity also seem to vary among studies. For example, while many studies \n\nidentify UVB radiation as the main solar waveband contributing for the inhibition of \n\nleucine and thymidine (Herndl et al., 1993; Aas et al., 1996; Jeffrey et al., 1996a; Conan \n\net al., 2008), others highlight the inhibitory potential of UVA and even PAR \n\n(Gourmelon et al., 1994; Sommaruga et al., 1997; Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2007). Some studies \n\nhave also indicated that leucine and thymidine incorporation are affected differently by \n\ndifferent UV wavelengths (Aas et al., 1996).  \n\nSolar radiation also affects bacterial activities at the single-cell level. For \n\nexample, in the northwestern Mediterranean Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes \n\nseem to be highly resistant to solar radiation, displaying small changes in activity after \n\nirradiation, while Alphaproteobacteria are more sensitive to radiation (Alonso-S\u00e1ez et \n\nal., 2006). More recently, the seasonality of bacterial responses to solar radiation was \n\nalso reported, with autumn and winter irradiances too low to cause changes in single-\n\ncell activity ([3H]leucine uptake), and variable effects in spring and summer (Ruiz-\n\nGonz\u00e1lez et al., 2012). \n\nStimulatory effects of UV exposure, particularly UVA wavelengths, on leucine \n\nand thymidine incorporation have been reported as a result of DOM \n\nphototransformation (Gustavson et al., 2000; Carrillo et al., 2002; Xenopoulos and \n\nSchindler, 2003; Pakulski et al., 2007; Piccini et al., 2009; V\u00e4h\u00e4talo et al., 2011). \n\nHowever, inhibitory effects of DOM phototransformation on bacterial activity have also \n\nbeen observed (Benner and Biddanda, 1998; P\u00e9rez and Sommaruga, 2007). DOM \n\ncharacteristics, such as its age and origin, seem to contribute to determine the effects of \n\nsolar radiation on the availability of DOM for bacteria (Benner and Biddanda, 1998; \n\nObernosterer et al., 1999; Anesio et al., 2000; Tranvik and Bertilsson, 2001). Freshly \n\nproduced or autochthonous DOM is prone to become more recalcitrant for bacteria upon \n\nirradiation (Tranvik and Kokalj, 1998; Pausz and Herndl, 1999), while irradiation of old \n\nor allochthonous DOM produces readily usable products which stimulate bacterial \n\ngrowth (Benner and Biddanda, 1998; Anesio and Gran\u00e9li, 2003). Furthermore, solar \n\nradiation is able to reverse the bioavailability of DOM to bacterioplankton, being the \n\nbiological reactivity of irradiated DOM inversely related to its bioavailability prior to \n\nirradiation (Obernosterer et al., 2001). The effects of DOM phototransformation on \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n33 \n\nbacterial activity have been associated with the changes induced in bacterial community \n\ncomposition by the process (P\u00e9rez and Sommaruga, 2007; Piccini et al., 2009).  \n\nUVR also exerts a significant detrimental effect on the activity of extracellular \n\nenzymes (Herndl et al., 1993; M\u00fcller-Niklas et al., 1995). Aminopeptidase activity \n\nappears to be particularly susceptible to UV exposure (Wetzel et al., 1995; Lindell and \n\nEdling, 1996; Espeland and Wetzel, 2001; Santos et al., 2011a). While UVB contributes \n\nthe most for the inhibition of extracellular enzyme activity upon exposure to natural \n\nsolar radiation (Espeland and Wetzel, 2001), UVA exposure can also result in \n\nsignificant enzyme inhibition (Tank et al., 2005). Inhibition of extracellular enzymes by \n\nUVB exposure has been attributed to their direct photolytic cleavage (M\u00fcller-Niklas et \n\nal., 1995). However, direct photoinactivation of enzymes by natural sunlight, at least in \n\nlakes, has been considered negligible (Scully et al., 2003). Alternatively, inactivation \n\nmight occur through photochemical processes whereby enzymes are inactivated through \n\nbinding of Fe (III) resulting from the oxidation of Fe (II) by H2O2 (Scully et al., 2003).  \n\nWhether UV radiation can exert a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on bacterial \n\nmetabolism seems, therefore, dependent on the physical, chemical and biological \n\nproperties of the water body studied. However, despite the variability of the reported \n\nresults, most studies are unanimous in concluding that UVR has the potential to alter the \n\nefficiency by which dissolved organic matter is transformed into bacterial biomass and, \n\nthus, affect global biogeochemical cycles. \n\n \n\nFactors influencing the responses of microorganisms to UVR \n\nThe impact of solar UVR on marine microorganisms is complex and several \n\nfactors, including species composition, environmental factors such as temperature, \n\nsalinity and nutrients, as well as intrinsic properties, like DNA repair potential and cell \n\nsize, are crucial in determining their sensitivity. \n\n \n\nTemperature \n\nInactivation of bacteria by UVC and UVB radiation has been found to be either \n\ninsensitive to temperature, suggesting that DNA damage arises as a result of a purely \n\nphotochemical process (Severin et al., 1983; Abu-ghararah, 1994; Pakker et al., 2000), \n\nor increase with enhanced temperature (Takeuchi et al., 1996; Li et al., 2002; \n\nWaterworth et al., 2002; Li et al., 2004; Matallana-Surget et al., 2010). On the other \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n34 \n\nhand, the photoreactivity of isolated DNA has been reported to decrease with increasing \n\ntemperature (Douki, 2006). \n\nConsistent with enzyme-catalyzed reactions being temperature dependent, DNA \n\nrepair rates in bacteria (Dorrell et al., 1995; Salcedo et al., 2007) and archaea (Eker et \n\nal., 1991) increase with temperature. Increased temperatures have also been found to \n\nreduce bacterioplankton sensitivity to UVR, as determined by [3H]leucine incorporation \n\n(Bullock and Jeffrey, 2010), while the activity of antioxidant enzymes during exposure \n\nto UV radiation has been shown to decrease with temperature (Borgeraas and Hessen, \n\n2000). \n\n \n\nNutrients \n\nOrganic and inorganic nutrients can influence the susceptibility of bacterial \n\ncommunities to UV radiation by affecting the penetration of radiation in the water body \n\n(Joux et al., 2009) or altering bacterial physiology (Steinberger et al., 2002). For \n\nexample, nitrogen (N) limitation can potentially increase susceptibility to UVR by \n\nconstraining the defences of the cell, since proteins involved in DNA repair require \n\nnitrogen (Lesser and Shick, 1989; Roy, 2000). Phosphorus (P) is a constituent of nucleic \n\nacids (DNA and RNA) and occurs in the phospholipids of cell membranes, as well as \n\ntheichoic acids and teichuronic acids of the Gram-positive cell wall. Phosphate is also a \n\ncomponent of ADP and ATP which is required, for example, for the activity of the \n\nnucleotide excision repair system (Moolenaar et al., 2000). Therefore, phosphorus and \n\nnitrogen availability could influence bacterial responses to UVR by affecting bacterial \n\nphysiology (Pausz and Herndl, 1999; Medina-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2002; Pausz and Herndl, \n\n2002).  \n\n \n\nGrowth phase and growth rate \n\nCell specific growth rate is also a critical determinant of bacterial susceptibility \n\nto UV radiation (Berney et al., 2006c; Bucheli-Witschel et al., 2010). UV effects are \n\nalso influenced by the growth phase, with stationary phase cells generally being more \n\nresistant and recovering faster from the lethal effects of UV radiation than exponential \n\ngrowing cells (Dantur and Pizarro, 2004). The influence of growth rate and growth \n\nphase on bacterial susceptibility to stress seems to be determined by the global regulator \n\nRpoS, controlling the general stress response in E. coli, whose expression increases with \n\ndecreasing specific growth rate (Notley and Ferenci, 1996; Ihssen and Egli, 2004). \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n35 \n\nIntrinsic DNA repair potential \n\nThe intrinsic DNA repair potential of bacteria can also influence their \n\nsusceptibility to UV radiation. For example, the enhanced UVB resistance of the marine \n\nbacterium Photobacterium angustum, compared to that of Sphingopyxis alaskensis, was \n\nassigned to the presence of three genes coding for DNA photolyase type I enzymes in P. \n\nangustum compared to only one in S. alaskensis. The presence of additional photolyase \n\nenzymes in P. angustum was proposed to not only enhance the efficiency for \n\nphotoenzymatic repair but also for nucleotide excision repair (Matallana-Surget et al., \n\n2009b). The presence of two recA genes was also proposed to account for UV resistance \n\nin Myxococcus xanthus (Nahrstedt et al., 2005), while two plasmid-encoded recA in \n\nDeinococcus desertii, in addition to the chromosomal recA, were suggested to provide \n\nhigher levels of RecA protein for efficient error-free repair of DNA damage (Dulermo \n\net al., 2009). \n\n \n\nThe surface microlayer (SML) as a model system for environmental \n\nphotobiology studies \n\nIn the environment, the effects of UVR on aquatic organisms depend on the dose \n\nof harmful radiation to which individuals are exposed, which in turn depends on \n\norganism positioning in the water column (Sommaruga, 2003). Thriving at the top \n\nmillimetre of the water column, also known as surface microlayer (SML), \n\nbacterioneuston is naturally exposed to high levels of solar radiation, including in the \n\nUV spectrum. However, enhanced bacterial abundance and microbial activity at the \n\nSML comparatively to underlying waters (Norkrans, 1980; Hardy, 1982; Agogu\u00e9 et al., \n\n2004) suggest a possible adaptation of bacterioneuston to high levels of UV radiation. \n\nSeveral factors have been suggested to contribute to the enhanced resistance of \n\nbacterioneuston to high levels of solar radiation, including the accumulation of \n\nexopolysaccharides and chromophoric DOM and POM (particulate organic matter) at \n\nthe air-water interface (Plane et al., 1997; Elasri and Miller, 1999; Whitehead and \n\nVernet, 2000; Obernosterer et al., 2005).  \n\nIts location and exposure to high levels of UV radiation make the SML an \n\ninteresting model compartment to investigate the interaction between UV radiation and \n\nbacteria that can provide relevant predictive information on how bacterial communities \n\nrespond to enhanced levels of UV radiation, in terms of functioning and structure.  \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n36 \n\nAs the role of the SML in the regulation of global air-water gas exchange, and \n\nconsequently in global biogeochemistry, has increasingly been recognized in recent \n\nyears (Upstill-Goddard et al., 2003; Calleja et al., 2005; Ploug, 2008; Cunliffe and \n\nMurrell, 2009; Cunliffe et al., 2011; Dixon and Nightingale, 2012; Cunliffe et al., \n\n2013), the assessment of the biological responses of bacterioneuston to UVR gains even \n\nfurther ecological relevance. \n\n \n\nObjectives of this thesis \n\nThe understanding of the significance of UV radiation as a controlling factor of \n\nbacteria is still limited, since comprehensive mechanistic studies of the targets of UV \n\nradiation on bacterial cells are scarce. This, in turn, limits the knowledge of the potential \n\neffects of changes in environmental UV levels in the function and structure of microbial \n\ncommunities.  \n\nThe following research questions were addressed in this thesis: \n\n- Does the light history of the bacterial communities from the SML and UW \n\ninfluence their UV sensitivity? \n\n- What are the cellular targets of UV radiation, how are they affected by \n\nirradiation and do they vary among bacteria? \n\n- Which ROS are involved in UVB-induced damage to bacteria? \n\n- Do metals play a role in UVB-induced damage to bacteria? \n\n- How do extrinsic (quality of the irradiating medium) and intrinsic (growth phase \n\nand temperature) properties influence the UV sensitivity responses of bacterial \n\ncommunities and bacterial isolates? \n\n- Does RecA evolution reflect an adaptation to withstand stress, including UV \n\nradiation, in particular bacterial groups? \n\n \n\nThese questions were addressed by:  \n\n- Studying the effects of UV radiation on natural bacterioneuston and \n\nbacterioplankton communities and the photobiological responses of bacterial \n\nisolates retrieved from the SML and UW in the laboratory (Chapters 2, 3 and \n\n4). \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n37 \n\n- Determining the cellular and biological effects of UV radiation of different \n\nspectral regions in selected environmental bacterial isolates, used as tentative \n\nbiological models (Chapters 5 and 6).  \n\n- Studying the influence of amendment of cell suspensions with ROS scavengers \n\nand metals on UVB-induced damage (Chapter 7 and 8) \n\n- Assessing the influence of resuspending bacterial cells in aqueous media with \n\ndifferent nutrient content and origin in the UV-sensitivity responses of bacterial \n\ncommunities and representative isolates (Chapter 9) and studying the influence \n\nof growth conditions in UV-induced damage (Chapter 10). \n\n- Studying the phylogeny of the RecA protein in order to infer the potential role of \n\nrecA gene duplication or lateral gene transfer events in the adaptation to UV \n\nradiation during bacterial evolution (Chapter 11).  \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nP\u00c1GINA INTENCIONALMENTE DEIXADA EM BRANCO \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n39 \n\nCHAPTER 2 \n \n\nEffects of UVB Radiation on the Structural and Physiological Diversity of \n\nBacterioneuston and Bacterioplankton \n\n \n\nSantos A. L., Oliveira V., Baptista I., Henriques I., Gomes N. C. M., Almeida A., Correia A., Cunha A.  \n\nApplied and Environmental Microbiology (2012) 78: 2066-2069 \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nThe effects of UV radiation (UVR) on estuarine bacterioneuston and \n\nbacterioplankton were assessed in microcosms experiments. Bacterial abundance and \n\nDNA synthesis were more affected in bacterioplankton. Protein synthesis was more \n\ninhibited in bacterioneuston. Community analysis indicated that UVR has the potential \n\nto select resistant bacteria (e.g., Gammaproteobacteria), particularly abundant in \n\nbacterioneuston. \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\nGlobal changes over the next decades are expected to increase the exposure of \n\naquatic organisms to damaging UV wavelengths, particularly UVB (280-320 nm), with \n\nfar reaching ecological consequences (Andrady et al., 2010). Therefore, a thorough \n\nunderstanding of the effects of UV radiation (UVR) on the diversity and function of \n\nbacterial communities, key players in nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems, is \n\nnecessary.  \n\nThe effects of UVB on aquatic organisms depend on the dose of harmful \n\nradiation to which they are exposed that is, in turn, determined by the positioning of the \n\norganism in the water column (Sommaruga, 2003). The surface microlayer (SML) \n\nrepresents a unique microbial niche in which the bacterial community (bacterioneuston) \n\nis exposed to high doses of solar UVR (Agogu\u00e9 et al., 2005). The higher abundances of \n\nmicroorganisms at the SML in comparison to underlying waters (UW) (Agogu\u00e9 et al., \n\n2004) could indicate that bacterioneuston may have adapted to this \u201cextreme \n\nenvironment\u201d, making it an interesting model system for the assessment of UV effects \n\non aquatic organisms by testing the hypothesis that bacterioneuston and \n\nbacterioplankton respond differently (in terms of abundance, activity, and structural and \n\nfunctional diversity) to UVB radiation. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n40 \n\nSampling and experimental setup \n\nSamples from the SML and UW were collected in triplicate (n = 9) from an \n\nestuarine system (Ria de Aveiro, Portugal, latitude 40\u00ba38\u2019N, longitude 08\u00ba46\u2019N) on \n\nthree consecutive days in June 2008. Samples were collected around noon, with clear \n\nsky and minimum wind (&lt;2 m s-1) and solar radiation levels ranged 30-35 kJ m-2 \n\n(climetua.fis.ua.pt/legacy/main/current_monitor/cesamet.htm). Water properties of the \n\noriginal samples are presented as supplementary material (Appendix). Bacterioneuston \n\nwas sampled with glass plates (Harvey and Burzell, 1972). Samples from underlying \n\nwater were taken at the depth of 20 cm. A total of three irradiation experiments (one in \n\neach day), with triplicate sub-samples, was conducted using unfiltered water samples \n\nsince preliminary experiments did not show a significant effect of grazers on the \n\nphotobiological responses in terms of abundance, activity or diversity of the bacterial \n\ncommunities (data not shown). For the experiments, sub-samples were transferred to \n\nuncovered Petri dishes forming a 1.5 mm layer. Irradiation was conducted with UVB \n\nlamps (Philips, UVB TL 100 W/01; maximum emission peak at 302 nm, pre-burned for \n\n1 h to ensure stability of light emission) during 4 hours, at room temperature (25 \u00baC \u00b1 \n\n0.5) with magnetic stirring. The cumulative UVB dose (60 kJ m-2, determined using a \n\nspectro-radiometer DM 300, Bentham Instruments, Reading, UK) was equivalent to \n\nambient surface UVR levels at 40 to 44\u00ba N latitude on clear summer solstice days \n\n(Seckmeyer et al., 2008). Aliquots were collected at pre-determined UVB doses (0, 12, \n\n24, 36, 48, 60 kJ m-2) for analyses. Dark controls were included in all experiments.  \n\n \n\n  \nFig. 2.1. UVB dose-dependent variation of (A) the abundance of culturable bacteria and (B) total prokaryote abundance. Results are \n\nexpressed as % of the dark controls. Mean values of triplicate determinations in three sub-samples of three independent experiments \n\n(n = 27) were plotted. Error bars represent standard deviations. Absence of error bars indicates that standard deviations are too small \n\nto see on the scale used. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n41 \n\nEffects of UVB on abundance and community composition  \n\nBacterial abundance, determined from colony counts and epifluorescence \n\nmicroscopy (Pernthaler et al., 2001), was less reduced (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05) in \n\nbacterioneuston than in bacterioplankton (Fig. 2.1 A, B), indicating enhanced UV \n\ntolerance of bacterioneuston, as previously observed in experiments with bacterial \n\nisolates (Santos et al., 2011b). DGGE profiling (Santos et al., 2011a) of 16S rDNA \n\nsequences showed a reduction in structural diversity (assessed from Shannon diversity \n\nindex) (Shannon and Weaver, 1963) of 14 and 25 % in bacterioneuston and \n\nbacterioplankton, respectively (Fig. 2.2) thus demonstrating the relevance of UVB \n\nradiation as driver of the structure of bacterial communities.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 2.2. Representative DGGE gel of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton exposed to different UVB doses (0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 \n\nkJ m-2), in which sequenced bands are indicated by an arrow. M: marker; N: bacterioneuston; P: bacterioplankton. \n\n \n\nSequencing of selected cloned DGGE bands (supplementary material in \n\nAppendix) revealed the predominance of ribotypes affiliated to Bacteroidetes-Chlorobi \n\n(band 1), Firmicutes (band 2) and Gammaproteobacteria (bands 3 and 4) in the original \n\nbacterioneuston and bacterioplankton samples. After irradiation, Gammaproteobacteria-\n\naffiliated ribotypes dominated both communities. Two strong bands (identified in Fig. \n\n2.2 as bands 3 = 9 = 18 and 4 = 20) affiliated to Gammaproteobacteria, persisted \n\nthroughout the irradiation period in bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton, suggesting \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n42 \n\nthe selection of resistant strains by UVR in both communities. These bands were \n\nalready prominent in the original bacterioneuston sample and occurred with equal \n\npredominance in bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton after irradiation. \n\nGammaproteobacteria have already been reported as resistant to UVR (Alonso-S\u00e1ez et \n\nal., 2006).  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\nFig. 2.3. Mean relative abundance (expressed as the percentage of total DAPI counts) of specific bacterial groups detected by FISH \n\nbefore and after exposure of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton communities to a total dose of 60 kJ m-2 of UVB radiation. Mean \n\nvalues (n = 27) were plotted. \n\n \n\nThe effects of UV exposure on community composition were also studied by \n\nFluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using Cy3-labeled oligonucleotide probes for \n\nthe domain Bacteria (Amann et al., 1990; Daims et al., 1999) and classes \n\nAlphaproteobacteria (Gl\u00f6ckner et al., 1999), Betaproteobacteria (Manz et al., 1996), \n\nGammaproteobacteria (Manz et al., 1996), Cytophaga-like bacteria (Manz et al., 1996) \n\nand Actinobacteria (Manz et al., 1996). The appropriate controls were included. FISH \n\nresults confirmed the dominance of Gammaproteobacteria in bacterioneuston and an \n\nincrease of up to 10 % (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05) in the relative abundance of \n\nGammaproteobacteria after irradiation of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton (Fig. \n\n2.3). In general, the different bacterial groups quantified by FISH followed a similar \n\ntrend of variation in bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton (supplementary material in \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n43 \n\nAppendix), with the exception of Actinobacteria, which increased in abundance by 32.2 \n\n% in bacterioneuston during irradiation, remaining un-affected in bacterioplankton. \n\nActinobacteria have been proposed to be genetically adapted to high UV levels \n\n(Warnecke et al., 2005). The results suggest that bacterioneuston may contain a pool of \n\nUV-resistant bacteria that are selected for upon UV exposure.  \n\n \n\n  \n\nFig. 2.4. UVB dose-dependent variation of (A) leucine incorporation (protein synthesis) and (B) thymidine incorporation (DNA \n\nsynthesis). Results are expressed as % of the dark controls. Mean values were plotted. Error bars represent standard deviations. \n\nAbsence of error bars indicates that standard deviations are too small to see on the scale used.  \n\n \n\nEffects of UVB on activity \n\nThe rates of leucine and thymidine incorporation were used as proxies for \n\nprotein and DNA synthesis, respectively (Moriarty, 1986; Simon and Azam, 1989). \n\nLeucine incorporation was more affected by UVB in bacterioneuston (Fig. 2.4 A), while \n\nthymidine incorporation was more inhibited in bacterioplankton (Fig. 2.4 B) (1-way \n\nANOVA, p &lt;0.05). Reducing protein synthesis upon UVB exposure could be a \n\nmetabolic strategy to enhance survival, as actively growing bacteria are more \n\nsusceptible to stress (Fischer and Sauer, 2005) and this could underlie the lower impact \n\nof UVB on bacterioneuston abundance. \n\nThe effect of UVR on the physiological profiles of bacterioneuston and \n\nbacterioplankton assessed with Biolog EcoPlatesTM (Sala et al., 2010) revealed a shift in \n\nthe spectrum of carbon sources used, as well as substantial differences in the metabolic \n\nprofiles of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton before and after UV exposure (Fig. \n\n2.5). In bacterioneuston, UV exposure resulted in a 31.2 %, 14.4 % and 6.3 % decrease \n\nin the use of amino acids, amines and carboxylic acids and an increase in consumption \n\nof carbohydrates and phenolic compounds by 42.3 % and 11.6 %, respectively. In \n\nbacterioplankton, irradiation caused a decrease in the utilization of carbohydrates and \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n44 \n\nphenolic compounds by 21.7 and 42.9 %, respectively, and an increase in consumption \n\nof amino acids and carboxylic acids by 42.2 and 22.5 %, respectively.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\nFig. 2.5. Mean relative consumptions of different substrate categories present in Biolog EcoPlatesTM before and after exposure of \nbacterioneuston and bacterioplankton communities to a total dose of 60 kJ m-2 of UVB radiation. Mean values (n=9) were plotted.  \n\n \n\nIn conclusion, the present work demonstrates that UV radiation has clear effects \n\non the structure and function of estuarine bacterial communities and that the SML \n\nenvironment may select for a bacterial community metabolically adapted to high UV \n\nexposure. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThis work was supported by CESAM (Centre for Environmental and Marine Studies, University of \n\nAveiro) and the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) in the form of a PhD grant to \n\nA.L.S.

M., Almeida A., Correia A., Cunha A. \n\nLetters in Applied Microbiology (2011) 52: 360-366 \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nAims: To assess the variability in the UVB (280-320 nm) sensitivity of bacterial isolates \n\nfrom the surface microlayer (SML) and underlying water (UW) of the Ria de Aveiro \n\n(Portugal) estuary and their ability to recover from previous UV-induced stress.  \n\nMethods and Results: Bacterial cell suspensions were exposed to UVB radiation (3.3 W \n\nm-2). Effects on culturability were assessed from colony counts and effects on activity \n\ndetermined from [3H]leucine incorporation rates. Among the nine isolates tested a wide \n\nvariability in terms of UVB-induced inhibition of culturability (37.4-99.3 %) and \n\nactivity (36.0-98.0 %) was observed. Incubation of UVB-irradiated cell suspensions \n\nunder reactivating regimes (UVA, 3.65 W m-2; PAR, 40 W m-2; dark) also revealed \n\ndiversity in the extent of recovery from UVB stress. Trends of enhanced resistance of \n\nculturability (up to 15 %) and enhanced recovery in activity (up to 52 %) were observed \n\nin bacterioneuston isolates. \n\nConclusions: Bacterioneuston isolates were less sensitive and recovered more rapidly \n\nfrom UVB stress than bacterioplankton isolates, showing enhanced reduction of their \n\nmetabolism during the irradiation period and decreased culturability during the recovery \n\nprocess compared to bacterioplankton. \n\nSignificance and Impact of the Study: UV exposure can affect the diversity and activity \n\nof microbial communities by selecting UV-resistant strains and alter their metabolic \n\nactivity towards protective strategies. \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\nSince the discovery of the stratospheric ozone hole, concerns regarding the \n\necological consequences of UV radiation have extensively increased (H\u00e4der et al., \n\n2007). In the face of a changing global environment, the assessment of the toxic nature \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n46 \n\nof UV radiation, most notably in the UVB wavelength (280-320 nm) that is expected to \n\nincrease as a result of the interaction of changes in UVB fluxes resulting from ozone \n\ndepletion and other climate changes (Andrady et al., 2010), has gained pertinence. \n\nBacteria play a key role in nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems (Azam and \n\nMalfatti, 2007), but their small size, short generation times and the fact that their \n\ngenome comprehends a large portion of the cell volume, might make them more \n\nsusceptible to the effects of UV radiation than higher organisms (Garcia-Pichel, 1994).  \n\nThe main biological effect of UVB results from UV-induced formation of \n\ncovalent links between adjacent pyrimidine residues, known as cyclobutane pyrimidine \n\ndimers. These dimers cannot be replicated and are lethal to the cell, unless damage is \n\nrepaired (Mitchell and Karentz, 1993). In response to UV-induced damage, bacteria \n\nhave evolved several repair mechanisms that can basically be divided in dark repair and \n\nphotoreactivation, a light-dependent repair mechanism that uses the photolyase enzyme, \n\nactivated by UVA (320-400 nm) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400 to \n\n700 nm) (Walker, 1984).  \n\nLocated at the air-water interface, the surface microlayer (SML) represents a \n\nstressful environment for microorganisms, where pollutants and heavy metals \n\naccumulate due to its lipophilic nature, and the intensity of solar UV radiation is at its \n\nhighest (Maki, 1993). Adding to their individual effects, pollutants and UV radiation \n\ncan also act additively or synergistically on aquatic microbes (Pelletier et al., 2006), \n\nthrough the generation of photo-oxidative products that might impose an additional \n\nstress on bacterioneuston, i.e., bacteria inhabiting the surface microlayer. Reports of \n\nhigher bacterial abundance and activities at the SML (Kuznetsova and Lee, 2002) have \n\nsuggested enhanced resistance of bacterioneuston to stress, most notably, UV-related. \n\nHowever, such a trend has not yet been demonstrated, and recent work has indicated \n\nsimilar UV resistance in bacterial isolates from the SML and underlying water (UW) \n\n(Agogu\u00e9 et al., 2005), though the authors only monitored the optical density of the \n\ncultures after the irradiation period. To our knowledge, information on the variability of \n\nthe responses of bacterioneuston isolates in terms of culturability and activity, as well as \n\ntheir repair potential under different reactivating regimes following UV exposure, is \n\nvirtually inexistent.  \n\nThe aim of this work was the characterization and comparative analysis of the \n\nsensitivity of bacterial isolates from the SML and UW of the estuarine system Ria de \n\nAveiro (Portugal) and the assessment of their repair potential under different light \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n47 \n\nregimes after UVB exposure. The variability in the extent of UV-induced inactivation \n\nand the influence of different light regimes on the recovery of selected bacterial isolates \n\nfollowing UVB stress were determined in laboratory experiments using artificial \n\nradiation.  \n\n \n\nMaterials and methods \n\nSampling and isolation of marine bacterial strains  \n\nBacterial strains were isolated from the SML and UW of the estuarine system \n\nRia de Aveiro, located in the western coast of Portugal. Samples from the SML were \n\ncollected using a glass plate sampler (Harvey and Burzell, 1972). Samples from \n\nunderlying waters were collected by submerging a polycarbonate bottle and opening it \n\nat a depth of 0.5 m. For the isolation of UV-resistant bacteria from the SML and UW, \n\nsamples from both water layers were exposed to UVB doses between 0 and 2200 J m-2 \n\n(Philips UVB TL 100 W/01 lamp, maximum emission peak at 302 nm; intensity of 3.3 \n\nW m-2), with agitation (50 rpm) and at ~20 \u00baC, as described by Zenoff, et al. (2006). \n\nSample aliquots (100 \u00b5 L) were removed at pre-determined intervals and plated in \n\nmarine agar 2216 plates (MA 2216; Difco, Detroit, Mich.). After incubation in the dark \n\nat 20\u00b0C for 7 to 14 days, isolates were selected from the plates according to \n\nmorphological differences and purified. Molecular typing of the isolates was performed \n\nby BOX-PCR, according to the procedure described by Rademaker, et al. (2004) and \n\nisolates displaying distinct BOX profiles were identified by sequencing the 16S rRNA \n\ngene using the primer 27F and an ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing \n\nReady Reaction Kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Sequences were \n\ncompared with sequences available in the GenBank database by using the BLAST \n\n(Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) service to determine their approximate \n\nphylogenetic affiliations (Altschul et al., 1990). The sequences obtained were deposited \n\nin the GenBank database (see Table 3.1 for accession numbers). \n\n \n\nPreparation of cell suspensions and irradiation conditions  \n\nBacterial isolates growing in marine broth were harvested during the exponential \n\nphase by centrifugation (3,200 x g, 15 min) and the pellet was washed three times with \n\nfiltered-sterilized autoclaved seawater to remove all traces of the culture medium. Cells \n\nwere resuspended in filtered-sterilized autoclaved seawater and bacterial abundance was \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n48 \n\nadjusted to 106 cells mL-1, as determined by epifluorescent microscopy counts. Bacterial \n\nsuspensions were transferred to sterile plates (Corning Science Products, Corning, NY) \n\nwithout the lid and irradiated under the UVB source used for the initial isolation for 20 \n\nmin (corresponding to a final UVB dose of 3.931 kJ m-2). During irradiation, samples \n\nwere kept at ~20 \u00baC and incubated under slow shaking (50 rpm). All experiments were \n\nconducted in the absence of ambient light to minimize photoreactivation. After \n\nirradiation, appropriate dilutions were plated on marine agar (MA 2216, Difco, Detroit, \n\nMich.). Each experiment was conducted with triplicate replicates in four independent \n\ntimes. \n\n \n\nTable 3.1.

Aliquots of \n\nsamples were collected before and after incubation of the cells for 60 and 180 min under \n\nthe different recovery regimes for culturable counts and bacterial activity assessment. \n\nEach experiment was conducted with triplicate replicates in four independent times. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n49 \n\nCulturable counts  \n\nThe UV-inactivation kinetics was followed by collecting triplicate 100 \u00b5 L \n\naliquots at pre-determined intervals. Aliquots were serially diluted in aged 0.2 \u00b5 m \n\nfiltered autoclaved sea-water and plated in Marine agar 2216 plates (Difco). Colonies \n\nwere counted after 2-7 days of incubation in the dark at 20 \u00baC. The fraction of surviving \n\ncells was calculated by dividing the number of CFU in the treated sample by the number \n\nof CFU in the unirradiated sample at time zero. The dilution and plating procedures \n\nwere carried out under low-luminosity conditions to avoid photoreactivation.  \n\n \n\nBacterial activity \n\nThe bacterial activity of cell suspensions before irradiation, after irradiation and \n\nafter reactivation was assessed from the rates of protein synthesis estimated by the \n\nincorporation of [3H]leucine (Amersham, specific activity 63.0 Ci mmol-1) into bacterial \n\nprotein at 480 nM final concentration in triplicate aliquots (1.5 mL) and one \n\ntrichloroacetic acid (TCA, Sigma, St. Louis, Mo) fixed blank (2 % final concentration). \n\nAfter 1 hour of incubation in the dark, proteins were precipitated by addition of 20 % \n\nTCA and samples were centrifuged. TCA-washed pellets were resuspended in 1.5 mL \n\nof Universol liquid scintillation cocktail (ICN Biomedicals, USA). The radioactivity \n\nincorporated into bacterial cells was counted in a Packard Tri-Carb 2000 Liquid \n\nScintillation Counter using the external standard ratio technique (Simon and Azam, \n\n1989). \n\n \n\nResults  \n\nIn this study, UV-resistant strains isolated after irradiation of samples from the \n\nSML and UW were used to assess the variability of UVB sensitivity and recovery \n\npotential in bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton isolates. UVB-induced inhibition of \n\nculturability ranged from 37.4 % in Micrococcus sp. (NT25I3.2AA) (Fig. 3.1 A) to 99.3 \n\n% in Staphylococcus sp. (NT25I2.1) (Fig. 3.1 E).  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n50 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFig. 3.1.

Results are expressed as % of the unirradiated sample at time zero.  \n\nSymbols:  \n\n \n\nUnder the UVA and PAR regimes, recovery of culturability (up to 90.0 % of the \n\ninitial value) was observed for 8 out of 9 of the isolates tested (Fig. 3.1 and 3.2). \n\nRecovery in bacterial culturability (up to 98.0 % of the initial value) was also observed \n\nunder the dark regime for 6 out of the 9 isolates tested (Fig. 3.1 and 3.2). The \n\nbacterioneuston isolates Micrococcus sp. strain NT25I3.2AA (73.5 %) (Fig. 3.1 A) and \n\nParacoccus sp. strain NT25I3.1A (99.0 %) (Fig. 3.1 B) showed the highest efficiencies \n\nin the recovery of bacterial culturability under the UVA and dark regimes, respectively, \n\nwhile the bacterioplankton isolate Bacillus sp. strain NT25I3.2AA (90.0 %) (Fig. 3.2 B) \n\nrecovered the most under the PAR regime. In general, significant differences between \n\nthe patterns of recovery under the different light regimes were not detected. However, \n\nwhen considering the SML and UW in separate, differences emerged. For SML isolates, \n\nthe most favourable light regime for the recovery of bacterial culturability was UVA \n\n(average recovery of 11.4 %), while PAR induced the lowest recovery rate (6.4 %). For \n\nbacterioplankton isolates, PAR led to the highest recovery rates (9.5 %), while the \n\nlowest recovery was observed under UVA irradiation (4.6 %). \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n52 \n\nBacterial activity also recovered, at variable extensions (0 to 78.4 %), under the \n\ndifferent light regimes (Fig. 3.1 and 3.2). In general, UVA radiation was the most \n\nfavourable light regime (up to 78.4 %) in the recovery of bacterial activity, while \n\nsignificant differences between recovery under PAR (up to 14.6 %) and in the dark (up \n\nto 17.2 %) were not found (1-way ANOVA, p > 0.05). Bacterioneuston isolates \n\nParacoccus sp. strain NT25I3.1A (78.4 %) (Fig. 3.1 B) and Pseudomonas sp. strain \n\nNT5I1.2B (14.6 %) (Fig. 3.1 C) showed the highest recovery rates in bacterial activity \n\nunder the UVA and PAR regime, while the planktonic isolate Bacillus sp. strain \n\nPT15I3.2CB (17.2 %) (Fig. 3.2 B) recovered the most under the dark regime. When \n\nconsidering the compartment from which the bacterial isolates were retrieved, the \n\npatterns observed for bacterial culturability were maintained, though for \n\nbacterioplankton isolates, significant differences were observed in the extent of the \n\nrecovery in the dark and under UVA radiation (twice as high than under the dark \n\nregime).  \n\n \n\nDiscussion \n\nSeveral studies on UV sensitivity and recovery potential in bacteria present in \n\ndiverse aquatic environments have been carried out (Joux et al., 1999; Arrieta et al., \n\n2000; Agogu\u00e9 et al., 2005). However, to our knowledge, no information exists on the \n\ndiversity of the UV responses of bacterioneuston isolates in terms of culturability, \n\nactivity and recovery from previous UV-induced stress. Therefore, in this study the \n\nvariability in the UV-sensitivity and recovery potential of selected UV-resistant \n\nbacterioneuston and bacterioplankton isolates was assessed under standardized \n\nexperimental conditions using a number of isolates similar to previous studies (Joux et \n\nal., 1999; Arrieta et al., 2000; Fern\u00e1ndez Zenoff et al., 2006b). \n\nExposure to UVB radiation revealed considerable variability in sensitivity to UV \n\nstress among the tested isolates, in agreement with previous reports in different aquatic \n\nenvironments (Arrieta et al., 2000; Ordo\u00f1ez et al., 2009). Micrococcus sp. \n\n(NT25I3.2AA) showed the smallest reduction in culturability upon UVB exposure. \n\nHigh UV resistance of several Micrococcus strains isolated from other UV-exposed \n\nenvironments is well documented (Fern\u00e1ndez Zenoff et al., 2006b; Ordo\u00f1ez et al., \n\n2009). The characteristically high G+C content of Actinobacteria has been proposed to \n\nconfer a protective effect against UV radiation, by protecting DNA against damage by \n\nthymidine dimerization (Singer and Ames, 1970). However, recent work by Matallana-\n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n53 \n\nSurget, et al. (2008) has suggested that microorganisms with high G+C content could, \n\nin fact, be more prone to UV-induced mutations, since cytosine containing \n\nphotoproducts are highly mutagenic. The determinants of UV-resistance in Micrococcus \n\nsp. remain, therefore, unknown. \n\nConsiderable differences were also observed in the extent of UV-induced \n\ninhibition of bacterial activity probably as a result of differences in the extent of the \n\ndamage inflicted to bacterial membranes. The observation that Staphylococcus sp. \n\n(NT25I2.1) was the strain most inhibited in terms of culturability but less inhibited in \n\nterms of activity is intriguing, since one would expect the two biological parameters to \n\nbe correlated. A similar trend was also observed in Micrococcus sp. (NT25I3.2AA) that \n\nwas least affected in terms of culturability but was the second most affected strain in \n\nterms of activity (80.4 % inhibition), as assessed from the rates of leucine incorporation. \n\nA possible explanation would be the induction of a metabolic shift from growth (protein \n\nsynthesis) to survival upon UVB exposure, recently proposed to occur in Bacillus \n\ncereus in response to acid stress (Mols et al., 2010). However, further studies are needed \n\nto reveal if such a response also occurs upon UVB stress.  \n\nThe most important biological effects of UVB radiation are probably a \n\nconsequence of the stalling of replication fork complexes by UVB-induced DNA \n\nlesions that block replisome movement or the synthesis by the polymerase subunits. \n\nTherefore, the ability of bacteria to survive UVB radiation is closely related to their \n\nability to either bypass or correct such damaged DNA segments (Friedberg, 1985).  \n\nFollowing UVB exposure, the recovery potential of the bacterial isolates was \n\nassessed under different light regimes. UVA and PAR were the most effective regimes \n\nin the recovery of culturability, but recovery under the dark regime was also observed \n\nfor most isolates. Such observation demonstrates the importance of photoreactivation, \n\nand particularly the enzyme photolyase, in the recovery from UVB stress, in accordance \n\nto previous studies (Kaiser and Herndl, 1997). The importance of photoreactivation for \n\nbacterial communities to cope with UV-induced damage might be related to its extreme \n\nefficiency, splitting approximately one dimer for every blue-light photon absorbed. \n\nFurthermore, unlike dark repair, photoreactivation does not require energy mobilization \n\nand may be particularly important in nutrient-limited aquatic microbial populations \n\n(Joux et al., 1999). Recovery in terms of bacterial activity was also observed under the \n\ndifferent light regimes, demonstrating that UV-induced impairment of biological \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n54 \n\nfunctions was not irreversible being, in general, UVA the most effective light regime for \n\nactivity recovery.  \n\nThough the number of isolates used in this study is too small to attempt the \n\nestablishment of a correlation between the origin of the isolates and their UV sensitivity, \n\nsome trends were in fact identified. For example, UV-induced reductions in bacterial \n\nculturability were up to 15 % lower in bacterioneuston, which might indicate the \n\npresence of bacteria displaying enhanced resistance to UV radiation at the SML. The \n\naverage recovery in terms of culturability was generally higher in bacterioplankton \n\nisolates (up to 76 %) than in bacterioneuston for all light regimes. On the other hand, in \n\nterms of activity, the recovery was higher in bacterioneuston (up to 52 %) under all the \n\nreactivating conditions tested. The observation of enhanced recovery in activity \n\naccompanied by reduced recovery in culturability in bacterioneuston isolates could \n\nindicate the engagement in a viable but non culturable condition as a stress response \n\nand/or defence mechanism that allows for the rapid re-establishment of bacterial activity \n\nwhen UV exposure is terminated. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that, \n\nin some cases, the UV-induced decrease in total cell numbers, determined by \n\nepifluorescence microscopy counts of acridine orange-stained preparations, was much \n\nlower than the one of CFU numbers (data not shown). Such a strategy has been \n\nreported, for example, in species of the genus Vibrio sp. upon exposure to thermal, \n\nsaline and acidic stress (Wong and Wang, 2004).  \n\nWhile addressing the resistance of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton strains \n\nto solar UV radiation, by directly isolating culturable bacteria from the SML and \n\nunderlying waters and monitoring the optical density of the irradiated cells, Agogu\u00e9, et \n\nal. (2005) concluded that UV resistance was similarly distributed in bacterioneuston and \n\nbacterioplankton. In fact, several studies have indicated that the bacterial community \n\nstructure of both compartments itself is similar and that the neustonic community might \n\narise from the passive accumulation of members of the planktonic populations at the air-\n\nwater interface (Joux et al., 2006). In this study, an alternative approach was used, in \n\nwhich samples from the SML and UW were exposed to UVB radiation and the UV-\n\nresistant species were isolated (Fern\u00e1ndez Zenoff et al., 2006a). While the ecological \n\ninformation retrieved from studies with culturable bacteria is considered limited, this \n\nalternative approach is likely to provide a new, ecologically relevant perspective on \n\nUV-sensitivity and resistance among culturable bacteria, since these strains are likely \n\nthe most relevant members of the culturable community upon exposure to UVB-induced \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n55 \n\nstress, and their metabolic strategies may drive the functioning of the communities \n\nunder UVB stress conditions. \n\nBy the selective elimination of sensitive phenotypes and the enrichment in \n\nresistant strains, differences in the UV-sensitivity of bacteria inhabiting the SML and \n\nunderlying waters seem to emerge, that can indicate the presence of UV-resistant \n\nmembers in the bacterioneuston population.  \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nAcknowledgments are due to the anonymous reviewers that greatly improved the earlier version of this \n\nmanuscript.

L., Baptista I., Lopes S., Henriques I., Gomes N. C. M., Almeida A., Correia A., Cunha A.  \n\nFEMS Microbiology Ecology (2012) 80: 646-658 \n\nAbstract \n\nBacteria from the surface microlayer (SML) and underlying waters (UW) were \n\nisolated upon exposure to UVB radiation and their individual UV sensitivity in terms of \n\nCFU numbers, activity (leucine and thymidine incorporation), sole-carbon source use \n\nprofiles, repair potential (light-dependent and independent), and photoadaptation \n\npotential, under different physiological conditions, was compared.  \n\nColony counts were 11.5-16.2 % more reduced by UVB exposure in \n\nbacterioplankton isolates (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05). Inhibition of leucine incorporation \n\nin bacterioneuston isolates was 10.9-11.5 % higher than in bacterioplankton (1-way \n\nANOVA, p &lt;0.05). These effects were accompanied by a shift in sole-carbon source \n\nuse profiles, assessed with Biolog EcoPlatesTM, with a reduction in consumption of \n\namines and amino acids and increased use of polymers, particularly in bacterioneuston \n\nisolates. Recovery under starvation was generally enhanced compared to nourished \n\nconditions, especially in bacterioneuston isolates. Overall, only insignificant increases \n\nin the induction of antibiotic resistant mutant phenotypes (RifR and NalR) were \n\nobserved. In general, a potential for photoadaptation could not be detected among the \n\ntested isolates.  \n\nThese results indicate that UV effects on bacteria are influenced by their \n\nphysiological condition and are accompanied by a shift in metabolic profiles, more \n\nsignificant in bacterioneuston isolates, suggesting the presence of bacterial strains \n\nadapted to high UV levels in the SML. \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\nAmong the different factors that affect bacteria, solar UV radiation (UVR) (280-\n\n400 nm) could be particularly deleterious because of their simple haploid genomes with \n\nlittle or no functional redundancy and their small size which precludes the accumulation \n\nof protective pigments (Garcia-Pichel, 1994). The importance of microorganisms in \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n58 \n\nglobal biogeochemical cycles and the expected increases in the exposure of aquatic \n\norganisms to damaging UV wavelengths over the course of the next decades (Andrady \n\net al., 2010) makes the study of the interaction between UV radiation and \n\nmicroorganisms a timely subject. \n\nStudies of photobiological responses of marine bacterial isolates have shown \n\nlarge variability in their sensitivity to UVR (Joux et al., 1999; Arrieta et al., 2000; \n\nAgogu\u00e9 et al., 2005; Santos et al., 2011b). UV-induced changes in bacterial production, \n\ngrowth, survival and species composition, through the selection of phototolerant strains \n\nor by inducing photoadaptation, can, in turn, cause changes in the trophodynamics of \n\nmicrobial communities (Arrieta et al., 2000; Winter et al., 2001).  \n\nThe toxic effects of UVB radiation are considered to be, for the most part, the \n\nresult of the absorption of photons by DNA, resulting in DNA photoproducts that block \n\nDNA replication and RNA transcription and, left unrepaired, can lead to cell death \n\n(Walker, 1984). Additionally, absorption of UV radiation by endogenous (e.g., \n\nporphyrins, nicotinamide coenzymes) and exogenous (e.g., humic substances and \n\nphotosynthetic pigments) photosensitizers can lead to the formation of reactive oxygen \n\nspecies and cause oxidative damage, potentially impairing bacterial activity and \n\nviability (Baxter and Carey, 1983; Cooper et al., 1988; Glaeser et al., 2010).  \n\nIn response to UV-induced damage, bacteria have evolved several DNA repair \n\nmechanisms that can basically be divided in dark repair and light-dependent repair. At \n\nleast three dark repair mechanisms can be found in bacteria: (1) nucleotide excision \n\nrepair (NER), (2) post-replication recombinational repair and (3) error-prone or \n\nmutagenic DNA repair (MDR) (Walker, 1984). The latter involves the activation of low \n\nfidelity repair polymerases, which are able to perform translesion DNA synthesis across \n\ndamaged regions, at the expenses of an increased mutation rate (Goodman, 2002; \n\nRattray and Strathern, 2003) and seems to confer an ecological advantage for \n\nmicroorganisms inhabiting UV-exposed habitats (Sundin and Murillo, 1999). Light-\n\ndependent repair, also known as photoenzymatic repair (PER) (Walker, 1984), uses a \n\nphotolyase enzyme that can be activated by UVA (320-400 nm) and photosynthetic \n\nactive radiation (PAR) (400-700 nm) (Sancar, 1994). \n\nVariability in UV sensitivity among bacterial strains is mainly determined by \n\ndifferences in intrinsic susceptibility and/or defence and repair strategies in response to \n\ndamage. However, several intrinsic factors such as the nutritional state (Nystr\u00f6m et al., \n\n1992) and growth phase (Berney et al., 2006c; Bucheli-Witschel et al., 2010), or \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n59 \n\nexternal factors like temperature (Matallana-Surget et al., 2010) can also influence UV \n\nsensitivity.  \n\nThe bacterioneuston inhabits the surface microlayer (SML), i.e. the top \n\nmillimetre of the water column, being naturally exposed to high levels of solar \n\nradiation, including in the UV spectrum. Reports of enhanced prokaryote abundance at \n\nthe SML in comparison to underlying waters (UW) (Agogu\u00e9 et al., 2004; Aller et al., \n\n2005; Obernosterer et al., 2005; Joux et al., 2006; Santos et al., 2009) have raised the \n\npossibility of the presence of bacterial strains adapted to multi-stress conditions, \n\nincluding UV radiation, at the air-water interface. However, experimental testing of the \n\nindividual sensitivity of strains isolated from the SML and UW did not confirm the \n\ndifferent resistance to solar radiation of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton isolates \n\n(Agogu\u00e9 et al., 2005). A more ecologically relevant approach to address UV resistance \n\nin natural bacterial communities can be the preliminary selection and isolation of UVB-\n\nresistant strains, likely to be relevant in the functioning of the communities under \n\nincreased UVB stress conditions (Fern\u00e1ndez Zenoff et al., 2006b).  \n\nThe hypotheses of this work are: (1) UV-resistant bacterioneuston and \n\nbacterioplankton isolates respond differently to UV radiation, in terms of damage, repair \n\nand potential for photoadaptation; (2) physiological/nutritional conditioning (starvation \n\nversus nourishment) affects the photobiological responses of bacterioneuston and \n\nbacterioplankton isolates; and (3) the pattern of photobiological responses is related to \n\nthe environment of origin of the isolates. \n\n \n\nMaterials and methods \n\nSampling \n\nSamples from the SML and UW were collected at Ria de Aveiro (Portugal), a \n\ntidal estuary in the western coast of Portugal. Sampling was conducted on three \n\nsequential days in 2008, shortly after the summer solstice, when UVB levels are the \n\nhighest (Seckmeyer et al., 2008). Daily solar radiation doses on the period of sampling \n\nin the South of Europe range 30-35 kJ m-2 (Abboudi et al., 2008). At the time of \n\nsampling the sky was clear and minimum wind conditions (&lt;2 m s-1) were observed. \n\nTriplicate samples with three sub-samples (n = 9) were collected in each sampling \n\nmoment. Bacterioneuston samples were collected using a 0.25 m wide x 0.35 m \n\nPlexiglas plate, which removes the upper 60-100 \u00b5 m water layer (Harvey and Burzell, \n\n1972). Samples from underlying water were taken directly by submerging sterile glass \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n60 \n\nbottles at the depth of approximately 20 cm. Water samples, kept at 4 \u00baC and in the \n\nshade, were processed within 3 h of collection. \n\n \n\nKinetics of community photoinactivation and isolation of UV-resistant bacteria \n\nSamples (30 mL) from the SML (n = 9) and from UW (n = 9) were transferred to \n\nuncovered 150 mm-diameter Petri dishes and irradiated with UVB (Philips, UVB TL \n\n100 W/01; maximum emission peak at 302 nm, pre-burned for 1 h to ensure stability of \n\nlight emission), with magnetic stirring, at 25 \u00b1 0.5 \u00baC. UV intensities were measured \n\nwith a monochromator spectro-radiometer placed at the sample level (DM 300, \n\nBentham Instruments, Reading, UK). The inactivation kinetics of whole bacterioneuston \n\nand bacterioplankton communities was assessed until an accumulated UVB dose of 120 \n\nkJ m-2. Aliquots were taken at pre-determined intervals to monitor the dose-dependent \n\nvariation of culturable counts during irradiation, as described below. After incubation in \n\nthe dark at 25 \u00b0C for up to 7 days, colonies were counted and the log of survival was \n\nplotted as a function of the energy dose. UVB-resistant isolates were selected from the \n\nbest dilution of plates corresponding to a cumulative dose of 60 kJ m-2, which is \n\nequivalent to ambient surface UVR levels at 40 to 44\u00ba N latitude on sunny days near the \n\nsummer solstice (Seckmeyer et al., 2008). Colonies were selected according to colour \n\nand shape and streak-plated at least three times for purification. The purity of the strains \n\nwas verified by microscopic observation after Gram-staining. Pure isolates were \n\ntransferred to marine broth 2216 (MA 2216; Difco, Detroit, Mich.) and the cultures \n\nwere used for subsequent molecular characterization.  \n\n \n\nMolecular characterization of the strains \n\nBacterial isolates were grown in marine broth on a laboratory shaker at 25\u00b0C. \n\nCells from stationary phase cultures in marine broth were collected by centrifugation \n\n(3,200 x g for 15 min) and the pellet was used for total genomic DNA extraction, as \n\npreviously described (Henriques et al., 2006b). BOX-PCR fingerprinting was used for \n\nmolecular typing of the isolates using the BOX A1R primer (5\u2019-\n\nCTACGGCAAGGCGACGCTGACG-3\u2019) (Versalovic et al., 1994) as previously \n\ndescribed (Rademaker et al., 2004). \n\nFor isolates displaying distinct BOX-PCR profiles, the 16S rRNA gene was \n\namplified by PCR using primers 27F (59-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-39) and \n\n1492R (59-GG TTACCTTGTTACGACTT-39) as previously described (Lane, 1991). \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n61 \n\nThe PCR products were purified (Jetquick PCR Purification Kit, GENOMED Gmbh, \n\nL?hne, Germany) and used as templates in the sequencing reactions, carried out using \n\nthe primer 27F at an external laboratory (StabVida, Oeiras, Portugal). All PCR reactions \n\nwere performed in an iCycler thermal cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA, \n\nUSA) using Taq polymerase, nucleotides and buffers purchased from MBI Fermentas \n\n(Vilnius, Lithuania). Sequences were compared with sequences available in the \n\nGenBank database by using the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) service to \n\ndetermine their approximate phylogenetic affiliations (Altschul et al., 1990). The 16S \n\nrRNA gene sequences obtained (> 430 nucleotides) along with those of related bacteria \n\ndeposited in GenBank were used to construct a phylogenetic tree. The analysis was \n\nperformed by the neighbour-joining method (Kimura two-parameter distance optimized \n\ncriteria) using MEGA version 5.0 (Tamura et al., 2011). The robustness of the tree was \n\nconfirmed by bootstrap analysis based on 1000 resamplings. Nucleotide sequences \n\ngenerated in this study have been deposited in the GenBank database under the \n\naccession numbers GQ365194-GQ365211 and GU084169-GU084170. \n\n \n\nPreparation of the isolates for the irradiation experiments  \n\nTo establish nourished conditions, bacterial isolates were grown in marine broth \n\non an orbital shaker (100 rpm) at 25 \u00b0C until late-exponential phase. For starvation \n\nexperiments, cells were grown in minimal nine-salt solution glucose medium (MNSS) \n\ncontaining 4.0 g L-1 of glucose, 2.2 g L-1 of (NH4)2SO4, and 0.54 g L\n-1 of K2HPO4, as \n\npreviously described (Nystr\u00f6m et al., 1992). The starvation regime was imposed by \n\nharvesting 5 mL of an exponentially growing culture by rapid filtration through a \n\nMillipore filter (pore size, 0.45 \u00b5 m), washing the cells twice and ressuspending in 0.2-\n\n\u00b5 m-pore-size-filtered autoclaved seawater, followed by a 40 h incubation on an orbital \n\nshaker (100 rpm) at 25\u00b0C (Nystr\u00f6m et al., 1992). \n\nCells grown under the different nutritional conditions were harvested by \n\ncentrifugation (3,200 x g for 15 min, 20 \u00baC) and the pellet was washed three times in \n\n0.2-\u00b5 m-pore-size-filtered, autoclaved aged seawater. Cells were resuspended in 0.2-\u00b5 m-\n\npore-size-filtered, autoclaved seawater. Bacterial abundance was determined by \n\nepifluorescence microscopy (Hobbie et al., 1977) and adjusted with 0.2-\u00b5 m-pore-size-\n\nfiltered autoclaved seawater to 106 cells mL -1. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n62 \n\nExperimental testing of isolated strains \n\nIrradiation experiments \n\nA convenient volume of cell suspension for each isolate was transferred to 150 \n\nmm-diameter Petri dishes so that the depth of the liquid was &lt;2 mm. The lid was \n\nremoved from the culture plate and the bacterial suspension was irradiated as previously \n\ndescribed for whole SML and UW samples with a total dose of 60 kJ m-2. Dark controls \n\nwere covered with aluminium foil and included in all experiments. Each experiment \n\nwas conducted with triplicate replicates and repeated in three independent moments. \n\nCulturable counts and activity (leucine and thymidine incorporation rates and sole-\n\ncarbon source use profiles) were assessed as described below.  \n\n \n\nRecovery experiments \n\nTo assess cell recovery, UVB-irradiated cell suspensions were subjected to three \n\ndifferent treatments: (i) exposure to PAR provided by white cold lamps (Philips TLD 58 \n\nW/84, total dose of 193.6 kJ m-2), (ii) exposure to UVA provided by Philips TL \n\n100W/10R lamps (wavelength range 350 to 400 nm, total dose of 52.6 kJ m-2), (iii) \n\nincubation in the dark for 4 hours. Aliquots of the cell suspensions were collected \n\nbefore and after incubation under the different recovery regimes for culturable counts \n\nand leucine and thymidine incorporation assessments.  \n\nFor mutagenic DNA repair (MDR) assays, 1-mL aliquots of UVB-irradiated cell \n\nsuspensions were added to 1 mL of 2 x LB medium (Difco BD, Franklin Lakes, USA) \n\nand grown for 12 h in total darkness with shaking. Appropriate dilutions were then \n\nplated on LB agar, and on LB agar containing either nalidixic acid (100 \u00b5 g mL-1) or \n\nrifampin (75 \u00b5 g mL-1) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The salinity of LB medium was \n\nadjusted to 36 PSU to correspond to that of marine broth routinely used for the \n\nmaintenance of the cultures. The frequency of mutation to nalidixic acid resistance \n\n(NalR) and rifampin resistance (RifR) was calculated as the number of NalR or RifR \n\nmutants per 108 cells as previously described (Zhang and Sundin, 2004). \n\n \n\nPhotoadaptation experiments \n\nIn order to identify UVB photoadaptive responses, the procedure described by \n\nJoux et al. (1999) was adopted. Briefly, cell suspensions were irradiated under UVB \n\n(Philips, UVB TL 100 W/01; maximum emission peak at 302 nm) for a total dose of 60 \n\nkJ m-2. Cell suspensions were subsequently exposed to UVA for a total dose of 52.6 kJ \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n63 \n\nm-2, which was followed by a 10 hour period of incubation in the dark. Cell suspensions \n\nwere then subjected to a second round of UVB radiation for a total dose of 60 kJ m-2. At \n\nevery point in the procedure, aliquots of cell suspensions were removed for the \n\ndetermination of culturable counts.  \n\n \n\nBiological parameters \n\nCulturable counts \n\nTriplicate 100 \u00b5 L aliquots were collected before and after irradiation, serially \n\ndiluted in 0.2-\u00b5m-pore-size-filtered autoclaved seawater and pour-plated in marine agar \n\n2216 (Difco, Detroit, Mich.). Colonies were counted after 7 days of incubation in the \n\ndark at 25 \u00baC. The dilution and plating procedures were carried out under low-\n\nluminosity conditions to avoid photoreactivation.  \n\n \n\nLeucine and thymidine incorporation \n\nThe effects of UV irradiation on bacterial activity were estimated by the \n\nincorporation of [3H]leucine (Simon and Azam, 1989)and [3H]thymidine (Moriarty, \n\n1986). Triplicate 1.5 mL samples and one blank (TCA-fixed sample) were incubated \n\nwith a mixture of [3H]leucine or [3H]thymidine (Amersham, Specific Activity 64 Ci \n\nmmol?1) and the equivalent nonradioactive substrate at final saturating concentrations of \n\n485 and 456 nM, respectively. Samples were incubated in the dark at 25 \u00b1 0.5 \u00baC for 1 \n\nh. Incubations were stopped by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to a final \n\nconcentration of 5 %, after which samples were centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 10 min. \n\nAfter discarding the supernatant, 1.5 mL of 5 % TCA were added and the samples were \n\nsubsequently shaken vigorously on a vortex and centrifuged again. The supernatant was \n\ndiscarded and 1.5 mL of UniverSol liquid scintillation cocktail (ICN Biomedicals, \n\nUSA) were added. The radioactivity incorporated in bacterial cells was measured after 3 \n\ndays in a Beckman LS 6000 IC liquid scintillation counter using the external standard \n\nratio technique (Fuhrman and Azam, 1982; Simon and Azam, 1989). \n\n \n\nSole-carbon source use profiles \n\nCustomized Biolog EcoPlatesTM containing 31 ecologically relevant C sources \n\n(6 amino acids, 2 amines, 10 carbohydrates, 7 carboxylic acids, 2 phenolic acids and 4 \n\npolymers) were used to assess changes in bacterial metabolic profiles during UVB \n\nexposure. For operational constraints, the effect of UV exposure on sole-carbon source \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n64 \n\nuse profiles was only assayed under nourished conditions in representative strains of \n\neach genus retrieved (Acinetobacter sp. strain PT5I1.2G, Bacillus sp. strain \n\nPT15I3.2CB, Brevibacterium sp. strain PT5I3.3L, Micrococcus sp. strain NT25I3.2AA, \n\nParacoccus sp. strain NT25I3.1A, Pseudomonas sp. strain NT5I1.2B, Psychrobacter \n\nsp. strain PT15I3.2CA, Sphingomonas sp. NT15I1.2B, Staphylococcus sp. strain \n\nNT25I2.1). \n\nBiolog EcoPlatesTM were inoculated with 150 \u00b5 L of cell suspension \n\n(unirradiated and irradiated) per well (OD600 = 0.2) and incubated for 72 hours at 25 \u00baC. \n\nAfter incubation, the optical density (OD) of the Biolog EcoPlateTM wells was measured \n\nusing the microplate reader FL 600 (Bio-Tek, VE). The OD of the control well was \n\nsubtracted from the OD of all the other wells to correct for background activity. Data \n\nwere exported into Microsoft Excel and treated using standard software (Garland and \n\nMills, 1991).  \n\n \n\nStatistical analysis \n\nAll experiments were repeated in three independent assays and parameters were \n\nalways determined in triplicate. Differences between treatments were assessed by 1-way \n\nANOVA using the statistical software SPSS v.17. Levene test was used to assess \n\nhomogeneity of variances. If variances were not homogeneous, the non-parametric \n\nMann-Whitney test was used to assess the overall effect of treatment. Differences with p \n\nvalues &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.  \n\n \n\nResults \n\nKinetics of community photoinactivation and isolation of UV-resistant strains \n\nIn bacterioplankton, irradiation with a 72 kJ m-2 dose resulted in the reduction of \n\nCFU concentration to the detection limit. Complete inactivation of bacterioneuston \n\noccurred with a dose of 120 kJ m-2. Exposure to 60 kJ m-2 of UVB radiation resulted in \n\na 1 log and 2 log reduction in CFU counts in bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton, \n\nrespectively (Fig. 4.1).  \n\nA total of 21 distinct isolates resistant to up to 60 kJ m-2 (10 from the SML and \n\n11 from the UW) were retrieved and identified. Isolates were affiliated with the genera \n\nAcinetobacter, Bacillus, Brevibacterium, Micrococcus, Paracoccus, Pseudomonas, \n\nPsychrobacter, Sphingomonas and Staphylococcus (Table 4.1).

Under \n\nstarvation, the average reduction of colony counts was significantly (1-way ANOVA, p \n\n&lt;0.05) higher in both bacterioplankton (76.0 \u00b1 11.1 %) and bacterioneuston (59.8 \u00b1 \n\n13.2 %), compared to nourished conditions, and also significantly higher in \n\nbacterioplankton than in bacterioneuston (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05). \n\n \n\nLeucine and thymidine incorporation \n\nThe reduction of leucine incorporation was stronger (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05) \n\nin bacterioneuston (38.5 \u00b1 15.8 %) than in bacterioplankton (27.6 \u00b1 10.0 %) isolates. \n\nStarvation did not significantly alter (1-way ANOVA, p > 0.05) the effect of irradiation \n\non leucine incorporation neither in bacterioneuston (39.3 \u00b1 16.6 %) nor in \n\nbacterioplankton (28.7 \u00b1 13.5 %) isolates (Fig. 4.3 B). The average inhibition of \n\nthymidine incorporation was similar in the sets of bacterioneuston (15.3 \u00b1 9.6 %) and \n\nbacterioplankton isolates (16.3 \u00b1 4.6 %) (1-way ANOVA, p > 0.05) (Fig. 4.3 C). Under \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n66 \n\nstarvation, inhibition of thymidine incorporation was significantly enhanced compared \n\nto nourished conditions and was higher in bacterioneuston isolates (30.2 \u00b1 15.0 %) than \n\nin bacterioplankton (22.1 \u00b1 10.9 %) (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05) (Fig. 4.3 C). In the set \n\nof bacterioneuston isolates, the incorporation of leucine was more inhibited than the \n\nincorporation of thymidine (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05). In bacterioplankton, the effect \n\nof irradiation was similar for the two monomers. \n\n \n\nTable 4.1.

In the present work, UV-resistant \n\nbacteria were isolated from the surface microlayer and underlying waters of an estuarine \n\nsystem and their individual UV sensitivity was assessed in terms of CFU numbers, \n\nactivity (leucine and thymidine incorporation), sole-carbon source use profiles, repair \n\npotential (light-dependent and independent), and photoadaptation potential under \n\ndifferent physiological conditions. The fact that only a relatively small number of \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n72 \n\nbacterial isolates was tested limits the ability to make generalizations for the entire \n\nnatural bacterioneuston or bacterioplankton communities. However, since these were \n\nthe only isolates retrieved upon irradiation of samples from the SML and UW, they \n\nprobably represent the dominant culturable members of the bacterial assemblages \n\ninhabiting these compartments. Studying their UV sensitivity responses can, therefore, \n\nprovide important clues to understand how the corresponding communities might \n\nrespond to enhanced UV levels. \n\n \n\nUV resistance in bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton \n\nIrradiation of samples from the SML and UW resulted in a steady decrease in \n\nthe abundance of total culturable bacteria. Culturable survivals in bacterioneuston were \n\nstill detected after an accumulated radiation dose of 108 kJ m-2, while bacterioplankton \n\nwas inhibited below the detection limit with 72 kJ m-2. This could indicate the presence \n\nof bacteria with enhanced tolerance to UVB at the sunlit SML, already reported in other \n\nlight-exposed habitats, such as the plant phyllosphere (Sundin and Jacobs, 1999) and \n\nhigh altitude wetland waters (Fern\u00e1ndez Zenoff et al., 2006b). The bacterial isolates \n\nretrieved at different UVB doses were affiliated to four microbial groups: the Gram-\n\nnegative Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria and the Gram-positive \n\nFirmicutes and Actinobacteria.  \n\nThe average results of the individual testing of the isolated strains revealed a \n\nlower (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05) UV-induced reduction in CFU in the bacterioneuston \n\nset, compared to bacterioplankton. The reduction in colony counts during irradiation \n\nwas accompanied by a decrease in bacterial metabolic activity, assessed from the rates \n\nof leucine (protein synthesis) and thymidine (DNA synthesis) incorporation. On \n\naverage, leucine incorporation was more inhibited in bacterioneuston isolates (1-way \n\nANOVA, p &lt;0.05), while thymidine incorporation was equally inhibited in both sets of \n\nisolates. Furthermore, in bacterioneuston isolates leucine incorporation was significantly \n\nmore inhibited than thymidine incorporation, suggesting uncoupling of DNA and \n\nprotein synthesis rates upon UVB exposure, already reported in other bacterial strains \n\n(Arrieta et al., 2000).  \n\nUV exposure was accompanied by a shift in the profile of sole-carbon sources \n\nused by bacteria. This shift was particularly significant in bacterioneuston isolates, for \n\nwhich a statistically significant decrease in the utilization of amines and amino acids \n\nwas observed, which could indicate a metabolic restructuring to compensate for UV-\n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n73 \n\ninduced damage to the protein synthesis apparatus (Sommaruga et al., 1997). \n\nFurthermore, in 7 out of the 9 isolates tested, a tendency towards the use of the \n\npolymers Tween 40 and Tween 80 as a preferable carbon source was observed upon \n\nirradiation. The observed changes in metabolic profiles could result from an active \n\ntranscriptional reaction of the cells to UV stress, involving a shift in metabolic strategies \n\nfrom growth to defence/repair, and/or could be a metabolic restructuring to compensate \n\nfor UV-induced damage to sensitive enzymes. For example, in Escherichia coli \n\nexposure to stressful conditions (temperature shift, oxidative stress and carbon \n\nstarvation) induces a reduction in metabolites of the central metabolism (TCA cycle and \n\nglycolysis), as well as an increase in free amino acids, as a result of protein degradation \n\nand stalling of translation (Jozefczuk et al., 2010). Further characterization of the \n\nmetabolites induced by UV radiation in bacteria could help to clarify the significance of \n\nthe observed metabolic shift during UVB exposure.  \n\n \n\nRecovery from UVB-induced damage and photoadaptation potential \n\nVariability in the extent of the repair of UV-induced damage was also observed \n\namong the tested isolates. Only small, non significant increases, if any, in the \n\nfrequencies of NalR and RifR mutant phenotypes, used to assay the occurrence of \n\nmutagenic DNA repair (MDR), were observed. Since the expression of MDR is \n\ndifferentially induced depending on the amount of DNA damage experienced by the cell \n\n(Walker, 1984; Smith and Walker, 1998), the reduced induction of the mutagenic repair \n\npathway observed in the present study could indicate that bacteria are probably able to \n\neffectively repair UVB-induced DNA damage by error-free mechanisms (e.g., light \n\ndependent repair and NER).  \n\nWhether bacterial photoadaptation occurs in aquatic environments has not been \n\nclearly established (Pakulski et al., 1998). In the present work, occurrence of \n\nphotoadaptation to a second round of UV exposure was not observed and the reduction \n\nof CFU numbers during the second UV exposure was, in fact, higher than in the first. \n\nUnlike DNA photoproducts, which can be effectively reversed by photoreactivation, the \n\noverproduction of ROS caused by exposure of organisms to UVB can have far wider \n\nranging consequences, causing oxidative lesions to biomolecules that are energetically \n\nexpensive to repair (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1999). Therefore, it is possible that after \n\nthe first UV exposure, the surviving cells accumulated lesions that made them more \n\nvulnerable to the second round of irradiation, which is in accordance with our \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n74 \n\nobservations of accumulation of oxidative products in bacteria after UV exposure is \n\nterminated (unpublished results). \n\n \n\nEffects of nutritional conditioning on UV-sensitivity responses \n\nStarvation significantly enhanced UV-induced reduction in CFU counts in \n\nrelation to nourished conditions. This observation suggests that starvation could \n\nenhance the sensitivity of bacteria to UV-induced damage, probably as a result of the \n\nsynergistic action of energy deprivation and accumulation of reactive oxygen species \n\nduring starvation (Hengge-Aronis, 2002), which is accentuated by UV exposure. \n\nStarvation enhanced the inhibition of thymidine incorporation but had no \n\nsignificant effect on the response of leucine incorporation to irradiation. This indicates \n\nthat UVB inhibition of DNA synthesis, but not protein synthesis, is modulated by the \n\nnutritional status of the cell, probably due to enhanced affinity of the protein synthesis \n\nsystem for ATP and GTP under starvation (Jewett et al., 2009). \n\nNutritional conditions also affected recovery from UV-induced damage. The \n\nextent of recovery was generally higher in starved cells, particularly for bacterioneuston \n\nisolates. Since starvation also induces oxidative damage (Hengge-Aronis, 2002), \n\ndefence mechanisms activated in response to starvation might allow for a more efficient \n\nrecovery once UV exposure is terminated. Enhanced resistance to UV radiation under \n\noligotrophic conditions has been reported for Vibrio sp. strain S14 (Nystr\u00f6m et al., \n\n1992) and Enterococcus faecalis (Hartke et al., 1998).  \n\nDespite the fact that dissolved organic compounds (e.g., free amino acids) \n\naccumulate at the SML, bacterioneuston seems to display lower bacterial growth \n\nefficiencies than bacterioplankton, suggesting differences in the physiological state of \n\nbacterioneuston and bacterioplankton (Kuznetsova and Lee, 2002; Reinthaler et al., \n\n2008). Rapidly growing cells are often more susceptible to inactivation than slower \n\ngrowing ones, because of the shorter time for excision repair between rounds of \n\nreplication (Harm, 1980; Jagger, 1985). Whether the natural differences in physiological \n\nstate of the bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton could influence their UV sensitivity \n\nand account for the enhanced UV resistance of bacterioneuston is unknown.  \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n75 \n\nConclusion \n\nThe photobiological responses (UV-induced damage, repair and potential for \n\nphotoadaptation) of bacterial isolates retrieved from the SML and UW upon exposure to \n\nenhanced UVB levels were studied under different nutritional conditions. Regardless of \n\nthe nutritional condition, CFU counts were more affected in bacterioplankton than in \n\nbacterioneuston, while protein synthesis was more inhibited in bacterioneuston. UVB \n\nexposure was accompanied by a metabolic shift, most notably in bacterioneuston. \n\nRecovery from UV-induced damage was enhanced under starvation conditions, \n\nparticularly in bacterioneuston isolates. These observations suggest that the SML may \n\ncontain a pool of bacteria adapted to cope with UV-induced stress.  \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThis work was supported by CESAM (Centre for Environmental and Marine Studies, University of \n\nAveiro) and the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) in the form of a PhD grant to \n\nA.L.

L., Oliveira V., Baptista I., Henriques I., Gomes N. C. M., Almeida A., Correia A., Cunha A. \n\nArchives of Microbiology 195: 63-74 \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nThe biological effects of UV radiation of different wavelengths (UVA, UVB and \n\nUVC) were assessed in nine bacterial isolates displaying different UV sensitivities. \n\nBiological effects (survival and activity) and molecular markers of oxidative stress \n\n(DNA strand breakage/DSB, generation of reactive oxygen species/ROS, oxidative \n\ndamage to proteins and lipids, and the activity of antioxidant enzymes catalase and \n\nsuperoxide dismutase) were quantified and statistically analyzed in order to identify the \n\nmajor determinants of cell inactivation under the different spectral regions. Survival and \n\nactivity followed a clear wavelength dependence, being highest under UVA and lowest \n\nunder UVC. The generation of ROS, as well as protein and lipid oxidation followed the \n\nsame pattern. DNA damage (DSB) showed the inverse trend. Multiple stepwise \n\nregression analysis revealed that survival under UVA, UVB and UVC wavelengths was \n\nbest explained by DSB, oxidative damage to lipids, and intracellular ROS levels, \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\nBacteria are very susceptible to the effects of UV radiation, due to their small \n\nsize, short generation time and absence of effective UV-protective pigmentation \n\n(Garcia-Pichel, 1994). Bacterial isolates have different susceptibilities to UV radiation \n\n(Joux et al., 1999; Arrieta et al., 2000; Berney et al., 2006d; Chun et al., 2009; Santos et \n\nal., 2011b; Santos et al., 2012a), and UV sensitivity is dependent on the wavelength \n\n(Sundin and Jacobs, 1999; Qiu et al., 2004; Bauermeister et al., 2009). Since different \n\nbiomolecules (e.g., DNA, proteins and lipids) absorb UV radiation at different \n\nwavelengths, a portion of this variability is likely due to differences in the preferable \n\ncellular targets of the various wavelengths. DNA is considered the major target of UV \n\nradiation. However, comparable levels of DNA photoproduct accumulation are \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n78 \n\nobserved in bacteria displaying different sensitivities to UV radiation (Joux et al., 1999; \n\nMatallana-Surget et al., 2008). In addition, DNA damage alone cannot account for the \n\ninhibition of bacterial activity in surface waters (Visser et al., 2002). Accordingly, it is \n\nlikely that damage to other biomolecules contributes to the inhibitory effects of UV \n\nradiation and the variation in UV sensitivity among bacterial isolates. \n\nUV radiation can be divided into three regions: UVA (320-400 nm), UVB (280-\n\n320 nm) and UVC (100-280 nm). UVC is filtered by the ozone (O3) layer and does not \n\nreach the Earth\u2019s surface. Terrestrial radiation, often called sunlight, contains about 8 % \n\nUVA and less than 1 % UVB (Coohill and Sagripanti, 2009). The biological effects of \n\nUVA are usually attributed to enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), \n\nwhich results in oxidative damage to lipids, proteins and DNA (Chamberlain and Moss, \n\n1987; Moan and Peak, 1989; Girotti, 1998; Pattison and Davies, 2006; Zeeshan and \n\nPrasad, 2009). UVB and UVC photons cause direct DNA damage by inducing the \n\nformation of DNA lesions (photoproducts), most notably pyrimidine dimers, which \n\nblock DNA replication and RNA transcription (Pfeifer, 1997). Exposure to UVB also \n\ncauses oxidative stress, as evidenced by the expression of antioxidant defences \n\nfollowing UVB irradiation (Qiu et al., 2005a; Matallana-Surget et al., 2009a). Although \n\nthe UVC region is not environmentally relevant, it is useful for assessing the UV \n\nsensitivity of bacteria that are highly tolerant or insensitive to high doses of UVB \n\n(Sundin and Jacobs, 1999). UVC radiation is also well known for its bactericidal \n\npotential (Jagger, 1985; Coohill and Sagripanti, 2008; King et al., 2011).  \n\nMost studies addressing the cellular effects of UV radiation on bacteria \n\nconducted to date have focused on one target (either proteins, lipids or DNA) in one \n\nbacterial strain (Abboudi et al., 2008; Matallana-Surget et al., 2008; Matallana-Surget et \n\nal., 2009a; Bosshard et al., 2010b), which has prevented a full understanding of the \n\nmolecular basis for the variability in UV sensitivity. Such information is crucial to \n\nunderstand the role of UV radiation as a driver of microbial diversity and function in \n\necosystems, as well as to the development of efficient and ecologically-friendly UV-\n\nbased disinfection strategies targeting a broad range of bacteria. \n\nThe objective of this study was to identify the major determinants of cell \n\ninactivation under different UV wavelengths in a set of bacterial isolates displaying \n\ndistinct UV sensitivity.  \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n79 \n\nMaterials and methods \n\nExperimental layout \n\nThe bacterial isolates used in this study were previously isolated from the \n\nsurface waters of the estuarine system of Ria de Aveiro (Portugal) and characterized in \n\nterms of UV sensitivity (Santos et al., 2011b) (Table 5.1). In all irradiation experiments, \n\nonly vegetative cells were used. \n\n \n\nTable 5.1.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation \n\n(3,200 x g for 15 min) in the late-exponential phase (defined as the inflection point of \n\nthe growth curve, at the transition between the exponential and stationary phase, which \n\nwas usually achieved in 8-14 h). The growth rates (\u00b5 ) of the isolates were determined as \n\npreviously described (Berney et al., 2006c) as \u00b5  = ?ln OD546/?t. The pellet was washed \n\nthree times in 0.2-\u00b5 m-pore-size-filtered autoclaved 0.9 % NaCl solution and cells were \n\nresuspended in filter-sterilized autoclaved 0.9 % NaCl. Bacterial abundance was \n\ndetermined by epifluorescence microscopy after acridine orange staining (Hobbie et al., \n\n1977), adjusted with filtered autoclaved 0.9 % NaCl to 106 cells mL-1 and homogenized \n\nby gentle vortexing. \n\nFor each isolate, 30 mL of bacterial cell suspension (corresponding, on average, \n\nto a biomass of approximately 1 mg mL-1 of protein) was transferred to sterile 150 x 25 \n\nmm plastic tissue culture dishes (Corning Science Products, Corning, NY, USA) so that \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n80 \n\nthe depth of the liquid was &lt;2 mm. For irradiation, the lid was removed and cell \n\nsuspensions were exposed to UVA (Philips TL 100 W/10R lamps, Philips, Eindhoven, \n\nThe Netherlands, main emission line at 365 nm, intensity of 50 W m-2), UVB (Philips \n\nTL 100 W/01 lamps, Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands, main emission line at 302 \n\nnm, intensity of 2.3 W m-2) and UVC (low pressure mercury lamp NN 8/15, Heraeus, \n\nBerlin, Germany, main emission line at 254 nm, intensity of 0.66 W m-2). UV sources \n\nwere placed at 20 cm from the sample. UV intensities were measured with a \n\nmonochromator spectro-radiometer placed at the sample level (DM 300, Bentham \n\nInstruments, Reading, UK) and the UV dose (in J m-2) was calculated by multiplying the \n\nintensity by the irradiation time (in seconds). The total cumulative doses applied were \n\n300 kJ m-2, 90 kJ m-2 and 180 J m-2, for UVA, UVB and UVC, respectively. During \n\nirradiation, samples were stirred by magnetic agitation and temperature was kept at \u00b1 25 \n\n\u00baC. A dark control (covered in aluminum foil) treated in the same way as the irradiated \n\nsamples was included in every experiment. Survival curves for each isolate were \n\ngenerated separately for UVA, UVB and UVC for the determination of the LD50 (UV \n\ndose resulting in 50 % inactivation). Aliquots of cell suspensions were collected before \n\nirradiation and at LD50 for assessment of activity, indicators of oxidative damage and \n\nactivity of antioxidant enzymes. Samples were immediately placed at 4 \u00baC in order to \n\navoid repair until further processing, which was generally conducted in less than 1 hour. \n\nAll experiments were repeated in three independent assays. Parameters were always \n\ndetermined in a minimum of three analytical replicates. Positive (50 mM H2O2-treated) \n\nand negative (untreated) controls were always included and processed along \n\nexperimental samples in order to ensure proper functioning of the procedures on all \n\nstrains. All determinations were carried out in a red-dark room to minimize \n\nphotoreactivation. \n\n \n\nColony forming units (CFU) \n\nSample aliquots of irradiated samples and non-irradiated controls were serially-\n\ndiluted in filter-sterilized, autoclaved 0.9 % NaCl and 100 \u00b5 L aliquots were spread-\n\nplated in agar plates (Difco). Colonies were counted after 3 days of incubation in the \n\ndark at 25 \u00baC.  \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n81 \n\nBacterial activity \n\nBacterial activity was estimated from the rates of [3H]leucine incorporation \n\n(Smith and Azam, 1992) in cell suspensions before and after UV exposure. Triplicate \n\n1.5 mL aliquots and a TCA (5 %) fixed control were incubated with a mixture of \n\n[3H]leucine (Amersham Biosciences, specific activity 160 Ci mmol?1) and \n\nnonradioactive leucine at a previously determined saturating concentration of 480 nM. \n\nSamples were incubated in the dark at in situ temperatures for 1 h. Incubations were \n\nstopped by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (5 % final concentration), after \n\nwhich samples were centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 10 min. The supernatant was \n\ndiscarded and 1.5 mL of 5 % TCA were added. The samples were then vortexed, \n\ncentrifuged and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed with 90 % \n\nethanol, dried overnight at room temperature and resuspended in 1.0 mL of Universol \n\nliquid scintillation cocktail (ICN Biomedicals). The radioactivity incorporated in \n\nbacterial cells was measured after 3 days in a Beckman LS 6000 IC Liquid Scintillation \n\nCounter.  \n\n \n\nIntracellular ROS generation \n\nIntracellular production of ROS was detected using the probe 2',7'-\n\ndichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) (P\u00e9rez et al., 2007). Control and \n\nirradiated samples were centrifuged and washed with 10 mM potassium phosphate \n\nbuffer (pH 7.0), amended with the probe (final concentration 10 \u00b5 M), and incubated for \n\n30 min in the dark. Cells were subsequently washed, sonicated and 100 \u00b5 L of the cell \n\nextracts were mixed with 1 mL of potassium phosphate buffer. The fluorescence of the \n\nsamples was measured with a Jasco FP-777 Fluorometer at room temperature, with an \n\nexcitation wavelength of 490 nm and emission wavelength of 519 nm. The fluorescence \n\nintensity at 519 nm was corrected against blank controls without cells and then \n\nnormalized to the protein content (see below for procedure) in comparison with control \n\nsamples.  \n\n \n\nDNA strand breakage \n\nUV-induced DNA damage was assessed using the quantification of DNA strand \n\nbreaks (DSB) as a proxy, due to the inability to detect the more routinely used CPDs in \n\nsome of the strains even after exposure to 180 J m-2 of UVC, potentially due to \n\nexperimental constraints. On the other hand, DSB accumulation, as well as the variation \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n82 \n\nof the other parameters assessed, generally followed a dose-dependent trend (data not \n\nshown). \n\nDSB were determined following a modified version of the FADU (Fluorimetric \n\nAnalysis of DNA Unwinding) method (He and H\u00e4der, 2002). In addition to the test \n\nsamples (so-called P-samples), the method requires two sets of untreated control \n\nsamples: samples not subjected to alkaline unwinding (T-samples) and samples \n\nsubjected to complete alkaline unwinding (B-samples). Cells were collected by \n\ncentrifugation (3,000 x g, 15 min) and digested with lysozyme (4 mg mL-1 final \n\nconcentration) in EDTA solution, followed by proteinase K (0.25 mg mL-1 final \n\nconcentration). A volume of 300 \u00b5L of 0.1 M NaOH was added to the three sets of \n\nsamples: (1) T-samples were neutralized with 300 \u00b5L of 0.1 M HCl and sonicated for 15 \n\ns, following a 30 min incubation at room temperature; (2) B-samples were sonicated for \n\n2 min, neutralized with 300 \u00b5L of 0.1 M HCl after a 30 min incubation and sonicated \n\nagain for 15 s; and (3) P-samples were incubated for 30 min, neutralized with 300 \u00b5L of \n\n0.1 M HCl and sonicated for 15 s. \n\nA final concentration of 5 \u00b5 M of Hoechst 33258 was added to all samples and, \n\nafter centrifugation, a 1 mL volume of supernatant was used for fluorescence \n\nmeasurements (?ex. 350 nm; ?em. 450 nm) in a Jasco FP-777 Fluorometer. The fraction \n\nof double stranded DNA (dsDNA) was calculated as dsDNA = (P?B)/(T?B)\u00d7100, \n\nwhere T, P and B were fluorescence intensities of T-, P- and B-samples normalized to \n\nthe protein content, respectively.  \n\n \n\nThiobarbituric acid reactive substances  \n\nLipid peroxidation was determined as the amount of thiobarbituric acid reactive \n\nsubstances (TBARS) as previously described (P\u00e9rez et al., 2007). Control and irradiated \n\ncells were centrifuged, washed, and resuspended in 1 mL of 50 mM potassium \n\nphosphate buffer (pH 7.4) added of 0.1 mM butylated hydroxytoluene and 1 mM PMSF \n\n(phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). After sonication and centrifugation to remove \n\ncellular debris, the soluble fraction was mixed with 1 mL of 20 % trichloroacetic acid \n\nand centrifuged (10,000 x g for 5 min). Supernatants were removed, mixed with 1 mL \n\nof 0.5 % (w/v) thiobarbituric acid in 0.1 M HCl and 10 mM butylated hydroxytoluene. \n\nSamples were heated at 100 \u00baC for 1 h, after which 1 mL aliquots were removed, cooled \n\nand then mixed with 1.5 mL of butanol. After centrifugation (4,000 x g, 10 min), the \n\norganic fraction was removed and the absorbance at 535 nm was determined using a \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n83 \n\nThermo Spectronic Genesys 10 UV spectrophotometer. TBARS content was determined \n\nusing an extinction coefficient of 156 mM-1 cm-1 and values were normalized to the \n\nprotein content.  \n\n \n\nProtein oxidation \n\nProtein oxidation was assessed from carbonyl levels as previously described \n\n(Semchyshyn et al., 2005). Aliquots of cell homogenates were incubated for 1 h at room \n\ntemperature with 10 mM dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) in 2 M HCl. DNPH was \n\nomitted in the blanks. Proteins were precipitated with 500 \u00b5 L of 20 % trichloroacetic \n\nacid, centrifuged (14,000 x g, 5 min) and the pellet was washed three times with 1 mL \n\nof 1:1 (v/v) ethanol-ethyl acetate. The final precipitate was dissolved in 1 mL of 6 M \n\nguanidine hydrochloride. Samples were spectrophotometrically analyzed against a blank \n\nof 1 mL of guanidine solution (6 M guanidine hydrochloride with 2 mM potassium \n\nphosphate). The absorbance at 360 nm was determined and the molar absorption \n\ncoefficient of 22 mM-1 cm-1 was used to quantify the levels of protein carbonyls. Values \n\nwere normalized to the protein content.  \n\n \n\nAntioxidant enzymatic activity \n\nIrradiated and non-irradiated cells were resuspended in cold 50 mM potassium \n\nphosphate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 1 mM EDTA and sonicated in ice. The extracts \n\nwere centrifuged (10,000 x g, 15 min) and the supernatant frozen at -80 \u00b0C until \n\nanalysis.  \n\nCatalase (CAT) activity was measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the \n\nrate of decomposition of H2O2 (Beers and Sizer, 1952). One unit of CAT activity was \n\ndefined as the amount of activity required to decompose 1 \u00b5 mol of H2O2 per minute \n\nunder the assay conditions. The strain Enterococcus faecalis was used as a negative \n\ncontrol. An additional negative control consisting of a mixture of 18 mM hydrogen \n\nperoxide with sterile potassium phosphate buffer (1:5) was also included in every \n\nexperiment (Anderl et al., 2003). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was determined \n\naccording to McCord and Fridovich (1969) in which a xanthine-xanthine oxidase \n\nsystem is used to generate O2\n- and nitroblue tetrazolium is used as an indicator. One unit \n\nof SOD activity was defined as the amount of SOD that resulted in 50 % inhibition of \n\nthe reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium. Potassium phosphate buffer was used as a blank. \n\nProtein concentration in cell suspensions was determined by the method of Bradford \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n84 \n\n(1976). The specific activity of antioxidant enzymes was expressed as units per \n\nmilligram of cellular proteins.  \n\n \n\nStatistical analysis \n\nDifferences between treatments were assessed by 1-way ANOVA using the \n\nstatistical software SPSS v.17. Levene test was used to assess homogeneity of \n\nvariances. If variances were not homogeneous, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test \n\nwas used to assess the overall effect of the treatment. Differences with p values &lt;0.05 \n\nwere considered statistically significant. Principal component analysis (PCA), used to \n\nreduce the variability of the data sets and identify the main parameters contributing to \n\nthe discrimination between UV treatments, was performed using software Primer 5. \n\nStepwise multiple regression, used to identify groups of independent variables that \n\nwould predict the dependent variable (LD50) with optimal efficiency, was conducted on \n\nSPSS v. 17. \n\n \n\nResults \n\nUV-effects on survival and activity \n\nUV sensitivity curves of the isolates under the different spectral regions are \n\nshown in Fig. 5.1 and were used to determine LD50 values (Table 5.1). \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 5.1.

For UVA, at LD50 inhibition of activity ranged from 5.1 \u00b1 0.1 % in \n\nPseudomonas sp. to 56.8 \u00b1 7.2 % in Psychrobacter sp. Exposure to LD50 of UVB \n\nresulted in an inhibition of activity ranging between 38.9 \u00b1 3.4 % in Sphingomonas sp. \n\nand 80.6 \u00b1 7.6 % in Bacillus sp. Under UVC, exposure to LD50 resulted in an inhibition \n\nof activity ranging between 72.7 \u00b1 6.5 % in Sphingomonas sp. and 79.4 \u00b1 7.0 % in \n\nStaphylococcus sp. (Fig. 5.2). \n\n \n\nROS generation and oxidation of biomolecules  \n\nROS generation also followed a wavelength-dependent trend of variation, being \n\nhighest under UVA (42.1 \u00b1 9.4 %) and lowest under UVC (8.2 \u00b1 4.1 %). The \n\nenhancement of ROS generation was more marked in Staphylococcus sp. with UVA \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n86 \n\n(56.4 \u00b1 5.9 %) and UVB (39.1 \u00b1 3.9 %) and Micrococcus sp. (15.2 \u00b1 1.8 %) with UVC \n\n(Fig. 5.3 A).  \n\nThe increase in DNA strand breaks (DSB) showed a wavelength dependence as \n\nwell, being highest under UVC (23.2 \u00b1 8.4 %) and lowest under UVA (7.9 \u00b1 5.7 %). \n\nDSB generation ranged from 1.4 \u00b1 0.1 % (Bacillus sp.) to 19.0 \u00b1 2.0 % (Staphylococcus \n\nsp.) under UVA, from 5.3 \u00b1 0.6 % (Micrococcus sp.) to 31.3 \u00b1 3.1 % (Staphylococcus \n\nsp.) under UVB and from 10.7 \u00b1 0.9 % (Acinetobacter sp.) to 35.7 \u00b1 4.2 % \n\n(Psychrobacter sp.) under UVC (Fig. 5.3 B).  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \nFig. 5.3.

A wavelength trend of variation was also \n\nobserved for TBARS, which showed the strongest generation under UVA (47.7 \u00b1 6.2 \n\n%) and the lowest under UVC (11.4 \u00b1 3.5 %). \n\nThe increase in protein carbonyl levels ranged from 15.2 \u00b1 1.6 % (Bacillus sp.) \n\nto 97.0 \u00b1 11.5 % (Sphingomonas sp.) under UVA (45.7 \u00b1 31.8 %), from 1.2 \u00b1 0.1 % \n\n(Micrococcus sp.) to 103.6 \u00b1 10.8 % (Brevibacterium sp.) under UVB (36.1 \u00b1 30.9 %), \n\nand from 6.3 \u00b1 0.7 % (Sphingomonas sp.) to 68.4 \u00b1 6.8 % (Staphylococcus sp.) under \n\nUVC (26.5 \u00b1 21.8 %) (Fig. 5.3 D).  \n\n \n\nAntioxidant enzyme activity \n\nThe effects of UVA on CAT activity (51.6 \u00b1 48.3 %) (Fig. 5.3 E) ranged from a \n\n62.8 \u00b1 6.9 % inhibition (Acinetobacter sp.) to a 99.5 \u00b1 9.8 % stimulation \n\n(Brevibacterium sp.). The effects of UVB (8.3 \u00b1 49.7 %) varied between a 89.1 \u00b1 6.5 % \n\nreduction (Micrococcus sp.) and a 62.9 \u00b1 6.6 % increase (Brevibacterium sp.) and UVC \n\neffects (19.4 \u00b1 25.1 %) ranged from an inhibition of 29.3 \u00b1 3.1 % (Bacillus sp.) to a \n\n48.8 \u00b1 5.8 % increase (Paracoccus sp.) in CAT activity. \n\nIrradiation with UVA and UVC caused an overall decrease in SOD activity (by \n\nan average of 28.5 \u00b1 25.8 % and 24.5 \u00b1 20.1 %, respectively), while UVB caused an \n\naverage increase of 21.5 \u00b1 19.3 %. The effects of UVA ranged from a 53.0 \u00b1 5.7 % \n\ninhibition (Bacillus sp.) to a 30.4 \u00b1 3.0 % stimulation (Staphylococcus sp.) of SOD \n\nactivity. UVB either had no significant effect (Staphylococcus sp.) or enhanced SOD \n\nactivity by as much as 59.1 \u00b1 6.2 % (Brevibacterium sp.) and UVC effects ranged from \n\nan inhibition of 47.3 \u00b1 4.9 % (Bacillus sp.) to a 18.0 \u00b1 1.7 % increase (Staphylococcus \n\nsp.) (Fig. 5.3 F). \n\n \n\nDifferences between wavelengths and determinants of inactivation \n\nPCA was applied to the data set to identify the main determinants of the \n\ndifferences between the effects of the three UV spectral regions tested (Fig. 5.4). The \n\ndifferent radiation regimes were clearly separated along PC1, with UVA-treated \n\nsamples displaying the lowest PC1 scores, mostly related to ROS (-0.495), TBARS (-\n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n88 \n\n0.496) and carbonyl levels (-0.231). UVC-treated samples displayed the highest PC1 \n\nscores, related to activity (0.484) and DSB (0.363), while UVB-treated samples were \n\nlocated in between UVA and UVC-treated samples. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 5.4. Principal component analysis (PCA) score plot of data (activity, ROS levels, lipid oxidation, protein oxidation, DNA \n\nlesions, CAT and SOD activity) used to determine the parameters contributing the most for the separation of UVA, UVB and UVC \n\ntreatments. A total of 27 data points (9 bacterial isolates x 3 replicates) was used for PCA analysis. \n\n \n\nMultiple linear stepwise regression analysis was used to assess the main \n\ndeterminants of bacterial inactivation, expressed as LD50, following exposure to UV \n\nradiation of different spectral regions. Results are presented in Table 5.2. Under UVA, \n\n34.2 % of the variability in LD50 could be accounted for by DSB and SOD activity. \n\nUnder UVB, 57.7 % of the variability in LD50 could be explained by the combination of \n\nTBARS, DSB and activity.

Additionally, multivariate analyses (principal component \n\nanalysis and regression analysis) were conducted to identify the determinants of cell \n\ninactivation under different UV spectral regions.  \n\n \n\nInterspecific variation in UV sensitivity \n\nResponses of the different isolates tested to each UV spectral region varied \n\ngreatly. Several factors can account for this variability. Specifically, the preferential \n\nmolecular target (e.g., nucleic acids, proteins, lipids) of UV radiation may differ among \n\nstrains. For example, it has been suggested that the extent of UV-induced DNA damage \n\nin Gram-positive bacteria is lower than that in Gram-negative bacteria because of a \n\nshielding effect by the cell wall (Jagger, 1985). Another factor is that the relative \n\ncontribution of different reactive oxygen species involved in eliciting UV-induced \n\ndamage may differ among strains, which may then affect the extent of the damage. For \n\ninstance, the presence of high concentrations of intracellular iron in Shewanella \n\noneidensis MR-1 promotes ROS proliferation and the production of the highly toxic \n\nhydroxyl radicals via Fenton-type chemistry; accordingly, this strain is extremely \n\nsusceptible to UV radiation (Qiu et al., 2005a). Finally, the efficiency of the defence and \n\nrepair strategies to cope with damage may also differ among bacteria (Arrieta et al., \n\n2000; Matallana-Surget et al., 2009b; Santos et al., 2011b).  \n\nIn the present study, the set of isolates tested showed in general a much higher \n\nresistance to UVA radiation than that reported in similar studies using Shewanella \n\noneidensis MR1 (Qiu et al., 2004) and Escherichia coli (Ubomba-Jaswa et al., 2009). \n\nUVB LD50 values were, on average, up to 10 times higher than those observed in \n\nAntarctic marine bacteria (Hernandez et al., 2006) as well as in a set of marine bacterial \n\nisolates and the enteric bacteria Salmonella typhimurium CIP 60.62T (Joux et al., 1999). \n\nOn the other hand, the average UVC LD50 (26.6 J m\n-2) determined in the present study \n\nwas lower than that detected in Clavibacter michiganensis (UVC LD50 of approximately \n\n75 J m-2) (Jacobs and Sundin, 2001) and even lower than the average minimal inhibitory \n\nUVC dose observed in a set of isolates retrieved from the peanut phyllosphere (Sundin \n\nand Jacobs, 1999).  \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n90 \n\nIn this study, the Gram-positive, high G+C content Actinobacteria Micrococcus \n\nsp. showed the highest resistance to each UV spectral region. Highly UV-resistant \n\nMicrococcus strains have previously been isolated (Ordo\u00f1ez et al., 2009). It has been \n\nsuggested that Gram-positive bacteria are better adapted to UV stress because their cell \n\nwalls screen out a considerable fraction of UV radiation (Jagger, 1985). The genomic \n\ncomposition of microorganisms, particularly the G+C content and bipyrimidine \n\nnucleotide frequency, also affects the frequency and spectrum of DNA lesions formed \n\nduring exposure to UV radiation (Matallana-Surget et al., 2008; Moeller et al., 2010). \n\nThe high G+C content of Actinobacteria has been proposed to confer protective \n\nadaptation against UV radiation by minimizing the formation of cyclobutane dimers \n\n(Warnecke et al., 2005). However, the other Actinobacteria tested in this study \n\n(Brevibacterium sp.) was quite sensitive to UV radiation, which is in agreement with \n\nobservations by Ordo\u00f1ez et al. (2009), demonstrating that cell wall characteristics and \n\nG+C content are not the sole determinants of UV resistance. The presence of protective \n\npigmentation (Shick and Dunlap, 2002) and specialized DNA repair systems (Dodson et \n\nal., 1994) in Micrococcus sp., but not Brevibacterium sp., could contribute to the \n\ndiscrepancy in UV sensitivity of these Actinobacteria.  \n\nGammaproteobacteria have been reported as the most UV-resistant group in \n\nseveral aquatic environments (Alonso-S\u00e1ez et al., 2006; Ordo\u00f1ez et al., 2009; Santos et \n\nal., 2012b). In the present study, Pseudomonas sp. showed high levels of resistance to \n\nthe different UV spectral regions, in agreement with previous studies (Ordo\u00f1ez et al., \n\n2009). UV-resistant Acinetobacter strains have also been isolated and their resistance \n\nassociated with efficient DNA repair mechanisms (Fern\u00e1ndez Zenoff et al., 2006b; \n\nH\u00f6rtnagl et al., 2011) and high catalase activity (Di Capua et al., 2011). However, in \n\nthis study, Acinetobacter sp. was found to be UV-sensitive. UV-sensitive and UV-\n\nresistant Acinetobacter strains have been isolated even from the same environment \n\n(Ordo\u00f1ez et al., 2009), suggesting that UV resistance is not a phylogenetic \n\ncharacteristic.  \n\nThe alphaproteobacterium Sphingomonas sp. also showed high resistance to UV \n\nradiation, which is in accordance with previous reports of reduced accumulation of \n\nDNA lesions in Sphingomonas strains following UV exposure (Joux et al., 1999).  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n91 \n\nGeneral trends in the effects of UV radiation \n\nDespite the interspecies variability observed, some wavelength-dependent trends \n\nin the variation of biological and biochemical parameters studied were identified. \n\nSpecifically, shorter UV wavelengths caused the greatest bacterial inactivation (denoted \n\nby lower UV doses being required to reduce bacterial numbers) and reduction in \n\nactivity, while longer UVA wavelengths had more subtle effects in accordance with \n\ntheir indirect, ROS-mediated mode of action (Eisenstark, 1998). Intracellular ROS \n\ngeneration, lipid oxidation (TBARS) and protein carbonylation, which are indicative of \n\nindirect UV effects, showed the strongest response to UVA irradiation. DSB formation \n\nresulting from direct interaction of UV with DNA was highest under UVC. The \n\nmagnitude of UVB effects was generally between those of UVA and UVC, supporting \n\nthe suggestion that UVB-induced damage comprises elements from both the direct and \n\nindirect pathways of damage (Qiu et al., 2005a). No wavelength-dependent variation \n\nwas detected for CAT or SOD, suggesting that the type of ROS involved in eliciting the \n\ndamage and the degree to which the interconnected mechanisms of ROS generation and \n\nremoval by antioxidant enzymes act in each particular strain are extremely variable and \n\nultimately shape the individual patterns of response of CAT and SOD to irradiation. \n\nPrincipal component analysis applied to the entire data set clearly separated the \n\neffects of different irradiation treatments. The extent of the oxidative damage to lipids \n\nand proteins, as well as ROS levels, were found to be involved in differentiating UVA \n\neffects from the other UV regimes, suggesting that membrane lipids and proteins are \n\nmajor targets of UVA-induced oxidative modifications, in accordance with previous \n\nstudies (Pizarro and Orce, 1988; Bosshard et al., 2010b). The effects of UVC were more \n\nrelated to the extent of damage to DNA (assessed using DSB as a proxy), which is in \n\nagreement with the mutagenic nature of UVC wavelengths (Friedberg et al., 1995), as \n\nwell as their inhibitory effects on activity. The PCA bidimensional plot showed that \n\nUVB-treated samples were positioned between UVA and UVC treatments, supporting \n\nthe intermediate nature of the effects of UVB when compared with those of UVA and \n\nUVC (Qiu et al., 2005a). \n\n \n\nDeterminants of bacterial inactivation \n\nMultiple linear stepwise regression analysis was used to assess the main \n\ndeterminants of bacterial inactivation following exposure to different UV spectral \n\nregions. The amount of DSB emerged as the major determinant of inactivation upon \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n92 \n\nexposure to UVA. UVA-induced damage has traditionally been attributed to \n\nphotodynamic reactions mediated by cellular chromophores since DNA does not \n\nstrongly absorb light in the UVA range (Cadet et al., 2005a). More recently, \n\ninvestigations conducted on eukaryotes have highlighted the high mutagenic potential of \n\nUVA (R\u00fcnger et al., 2012) and the role of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, rather than \n\noxidative lesions, in UVA-induced damage (Ikehata et al., 2008). The finding that UVA \n\ninduced the lowest reduction in CFU among the investigated spectral regions \n\ndemonstrates that bacteria are able to minimize UVA-induced DNA lesions. This may \n\ninvolve light-dependent repair mechanisms mediated by photolyase activated by UVA \n\nradiation itself, as well as light-independent repair (Mitchell and Karentz, 1993). \n\nAdditionally, most UVA sensitive strains displayed significantly higher levels of DSB \n\nand TBARS (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05). Taken together, these results suggest that the \n\nextent of oxidative damage to biomolecules and counteracting protective mechanisms \n\nunderlie the variability in UVA susceptibility among different bacteria, but that the \n\naccumulation of DNA damage ultimately leads to cell death. \n\nUnder UVB, oxidative damage to lipids (TBARS), accumulation of DNA \n\ndamage, and loss of metabolic activity were the main determinants of inactivation. \n\nThese results indicate that, in addition to DNA damage, changes in the integrity of \n\nmembrane structure and functionality during UVB exposure play an important role in \n\nbacterial inactivation. Such changes may compromise the ability of the cell to generate \n\nenergy necessary to sustain its activity and elicit repair strategies following irradiation \n\n(Bosshard et al., 2010a). Most UVB-sensitive strains displayed significantly higher \n\nlevels of protein carbonyls than resistant ones (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05), which also \n\nidentifies protein oxidation as an important determinant of bacterial susceptibility to \n\nUVB radiation. UVB was the only irradiation regime to enhance SOD activity levels in \n\nall bacteria when compared with non-irradiated controls, indicating that SOD may play \n\nan important protective role against UVB. The superoxide radical is able to directly \n\ncause oxidative damage to the bases of DNA (Misiaszek et al., 2004). Additionally, \n\nsuperoxide can attack Fe-S clusters of enzymes, rendering them inactive. The released \n\nferrous iron can, in turn, react with H2O2, resulting in the formation of the highly toxic \n\nhydroxyl radical which is able to attack virtually any biomolecule (Imlay, 2006).  \n\nRegression analysis revealed that ROS levels together with DNA damage were \n\nthe best predictors of cell inactivation under UVC. However, the extent of DNA damage \n\ndid not differ significantly between resistant and sensitive strains, which is in \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n93 \n\naccordance with previous observations (De La Vega et al., 2005). On the other hand, \n\nmost UVC sensitive strains displayed significantly higher TBARS and carbonyls levels \n\nthan resistant ones (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05), which suggests that the extent of \n\noxidative damage to lipids and proteins interferes with vital biological functions and is \n\ntherefore an important component of UVC-induced inactivation (Krisko and Radman, \n\n2010; Schenk et al., 2011). Unexpectedly, ROS levels were significantly higher in \n\nresistant strains (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05); however, it is unclear if these findings have \n\nany biological significance. Accordingly, additional studies to investigate whether ROS \n\ngeneration is involved in eliciting specific defence strategies in response to UVC \n\nexposure, as in cyanobacteria (Dillon et al., 2002) and plants (Murphy and Huerta, \n\n1990), are warranted. \n\n \n\nNew insights into the mechanisms of UV-induced damage in bacteria \n\nThe present work aimed to dissect the wavelength dependence of the damage \n\ninduced by UV radiation. In order to do so, a combination of a multitude of UV-\n\nsensitivity tests and their statistical analysis was applied. Using this combined \n\ninnovative approach new clues regarding the targets of UV radiation of different \n\nspectral regions across a range of bacteria with different UV susceptibilities emerged. In \n\nparticular, the involvement of DNA damage in eliciting bacterial inactivation upon \n\nUVA exposure was observed, which is in accordance with work reporting the induction \n\nof the SOS response in UVA-irradiated bacteria (Qiu et al., 2005a; Berney et al., \n\n2006a). Oxidative damage to lipids was found to be determinant for bacterial \n\ninactivation during UVB exposure. Such observation is in agreement with recent reports \n\nof enhanced expression of the glyoxalase protein and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase \n\nAhpC, involved in the detoxification of lipid peroxidation by-products, following UVB \n\nexposure of Photobacterium angustum S14 (Matallana-Surget et al., 2012). Finally, \n\noxidative stress was also found to be crucial for cell inactivation under UVC, supporting \n\nevidence accumulating in recent years (Gomes et al., 2005; Krisko and Radman, 2010; \n\nSchenk et al., 2011). \n\nMost investigations on the effects of UV radiation on bacteria have been \n\nconducted on a small number of genetically-well characterized microorganisms that are \n\nnot always representative of natural environmental communities. By using bacterial \n\nstrains originating from a photo-stressed microbial community (Santos et al., 2011b), \n\nthe information gained from the isolates used in the present work could provide clues to \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n94 \n\nunderstand how natural microbial assemblages might react to global changes, \n\nparticularly changes in environmentally relevant UV radiation.  \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThe authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers and editors who provided helpful criticism and \n\nsuggestions which greatly contributed to improve the original manuscript.

L., Moreirinha C., Henriques I., Almeida A., Delgadillo I., Correia A., Cunha A. \n\nSubmitted for publication \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nThe knowledge of the mechanisms of bacterial inactivation by UV radiation of \n\ndifferent wavelengths can contribute for a better understanding of the environmental \n\neffects of enhanced UV levels associated with global environmental changes, as well as \n\nthe optimization of UV-based disinfection strategies.  \n\nIn the present work, the effect of exposure to UV radiation of different spectral \n\nregions (UVC, 100-280 nm; UVB, 280-320 nm; UVA, 320-400 nm) on the lipids and \n\nproteins of two bacterial strains with distinct UV sensitivities was studied by mid-\n\ninfrared spectroscopy. Exposure to UV radiation caused a general increase in lipid \n\nmethylation, accompanied by lipid oxidation and potentially altered lipid composition, \n\nwhich could reflect UV-induced damage to enzymes involved in lipid metabolism \n\nand/or a metabolic strategy to preserve the resources of the cell for defence/repair \n\nstrategies. Mid-infrared spectroscopy also revealed effects of UV radiation on protein \n\nconformation and/or composition, oxidative damage to amino acid side chain residues \n\nand potentially changes in the propionylation, glycosylation and/or phosphorylation \n\nstatus of proteins. These results highlight the array of modifications induced by UV \n\nradiation on the lipids and proteins of bacteria, giving further support to the role of \n\nmodifications induced in these biomolecules in the UV-based inactivation process. \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\nUV radiation is an important stress factor for aquatic bacterial communities \n\n(Herndl et al., 1997; Moran and Zepp, 2000; H\u00e4der, 2001; Buma et al., 2003). UV \n\nradiation can be divided in three categories: UVC (100-280 nm), UVB (280-320 nm) \n\nand UVA (320-400 nm). Most environmental photobiology studies have focused on \n\nUVB effects on bacteria (W\u00e4ngberg et al., 1998; Joux et al., 1999; Arrieta et al., 2000; \n\nGustavson et al., 2000; Buma et al., 2001; Chatila et al., 2001; Fern\u00e1ndez Zenoff et al., \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n96 \n\n2006a; Fern\u00e1ndez Zenoff et al., 2006b; W\u00e4ngberg et al., 2008; Martin et al., 2009; \n\nSantos et al., 2011a; Santos et al., 2012b). Though on a photon basis UVA radiation \n\ncontains less energy than UVB radiation, the fraction of solar radiation in the UVA (95 \n\n%) spectrum is greater than that in the UVB spectrum (5 %) and can potentially cause \n\nsubstantial biological damage (Frederick and Lubin, 1988; Nunez et al., 1994; Moan et \n\nal., 1999), which is explored in the process of solar disinfection (Wegelin et al., 1994). \n\nUVC radiation does not penetrate the Earth's atmosphere, but it is a convenient \n\nexperimental tool to assess UV sensitivity in bacteria that are highly tolerant or \n\ninsensitive to high doses of UVB (Sundin and Jacobs, 1999). Furthermore, its ability to \n\ninactivate bacteria is widely recognized (Jagger, 1985; Coohill and Sagripanti, 2008; \n\nKing et al., 2011).  \n\nThe biological effects of the different UV wavelengths are distinguished in their \n\npreferential cellular targets and mechanisms by which they induce damage. The effects \n\nof UVA are considered to be mostly indirect, that is, mediated by reactive oxygen \n\nspecies (ROS) formed by photodynamic reactions involving intracellular or \n\nextracellular photosensitizers (Chamberlain and Moss, 1987; Moan and Peak, 1989; \n\nGirotti, 1998; Pattison and Davies, 2006; Zeeshan and Prasad, 2009). These ROS can \n\nreact with cellular constituents, most notably proteins and lipids, leading to altered \n\nmembrane permeability and/or disruption of transmembrane ion gradients that \n\neventually can result in cell death (Bose and Chatterjee, 1995; Futsaether et al., 1995). \n\nUVC radiation is the most detrimental to living cells, because it is directly absorbed by \n\nDNA, causing the formation of cyclobutane dimers and single-strand breaks in the \n\nsugar-phosphate backbone of DNA (Pfeifer, 1997). UVB radiation produces both direct \n\nand indirect damage (Moran and Zepp, 2000). \n\nIron is a key mediator of the processes of ROS generation, due to its \n\ninvolvement in the Fenton reaction which generates the highly reactive hydroxyl radical \n\n(Wardman and Candeias, 1996). Fenton reactions are accelerated by light (photo-Fenton \n\nreactions) (Chamberlain and Moss, 1987). Accordingly, Fenton-mediated oxidative \n\ndamage is enhanced upon UV exposure (Moss and Smith, 1981). The presence of high \n\namounts of iron sequestered in membranes, particularly associated with respiratory \n\nproteins, makes bacterial cell membranes potentially important targets of oxidative \n\nreactions (Kohen et al., 1995).  \n\nWhile there are several studies of the effects of UV radiation on DNA (Moeller \n\net al., 2007a; Matallana-Surget et al., 2008; Matallana-Surget et al., 2010; Moeller et al., \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n97 \n\n2010), the observation of comparable levels of DNA photoproduct accumulation in \n\nbacteria displaying different sensitivities to UV radiation (Joux et al., 1999; Matallana-\n\nSurget et al., 2008) and the fact that DNA damage alone cannot account for the \n\ninhibition of bacterial activity in surface waters (Visser et al., 2002) seems to imply that \n\ndamage to other biomolecules contributes to the inhibitory effects of UV radiation. \n\nOxidative damage to lipids and proteins may play a role in the process (Chamberlain \n\nand Moss, 1987; Hoerter et al., 2005a; Bosshard et al., 2010b). \n\nThe knowledge of the targets of UVA and UVB on bacterial cells is crucial to \n\nunderstand their roles as drivers of bacterial community structure and function and fully \n\ncomprehend how enhanced UV fluxes resulting from global changes (Andrady et al., \n\n2010) can impact biogeochemical cycles. Additionally, integrated information of the \n\neffects of UV radiation of different wavelengths may contribute for the design of more \n\nefficient and ecologically-friendly UV-based disinfection strategies applicable either in \n\nthe industrial setting or in a solar disinfection context.  \n\nThe objective of this work was to study the modifications induced by exposure \n\nto UV radiation of different spectral regions on the lipids and proteins of two bacterial \n\nstrains displaying different UV sensitivities using mid-infrared spectroscopy. \n\n \n\nMaterials and methods \n\nBacterial strains and irradiation conditions \n\nThe bacterial strains used in this study (Acinetobacter sp. strain PT5I1.2G, \n\nNCBI accession number GQ365202 and Pseudomonas sp. strain NT5I1.2B, NCBI \n\naccession number GU084169) were isolated from the surface waters of the estuarine \n\nsystem of Ria de Aveiro (Portugal) (Santos et al., 2011b) (Table 6.1). Two \n\nGammaproteobacteria strains were selected because this group is dominant in the UV-\n\nexposed surface layers of water bodies and several of their members have been \n\nproposed to be UV-resistant (Franklin et al., 2005; Alonso-S\u00e1ez et al., 2006; Santos et \n\nal., 2012b). The Pseudomonas strain used in the present study is UVB-resistant (LD50 \n\nfor UVA, UVB and UVC of 221.3 kJ m-2, 49.3 kJ m-2 and 40.6 J m-2, respectively), \n\nrecovering efficiently from UVB-induced damage, while the Acinetobacter strain is \n\nmore sensitive to UVB radiation (LD50 for UVA, UVB and UVC of 159.3 kJ m\n-2, 34.1 \n\nkJ m-2 and 18.0 J m-2, respectively) and less able to recover from UVB-induced damage \n\n(Santos et al., 2011b).  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n98 \n\nTable 6.1.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation (3,200 x g for \n\n15 min, 20 \u00baC, Eppendorf centrifuge 5415R, Hamburg, Germany) and the pellet was \n\nwashed three times in 0.9 % NaCl, in order to remove all traces of nutrients originating \n\nfrom the culture medium. Bacterial cells were then resuspended in 0.9 % NaCl and \n\nbacterial abundance was adjusted with 0.9 % NaCl to 106 cells mL-1, as determined by \n\nepifluorescence microscopy (Hobbie et al., 1977).  \n\nCell suspensions were placed in sterile Petri dishes (150 x 25 mm; Corning) and \n\nirradiated (without the lid) with UVA (Philips TL 100 W/10R lamps, Philips, \n\nEindhoven, The Netherlands, main emission line at 365 nm, intensity of 50 W m-2), \n\nUVB (Philips TL 100 W/01 lamps, Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands, main emission \n\nline at 302 nm, intensity of 2.3 W m-2) and UVC (low pressure mercury lamp NN 8/15, \n\nHeraeus, Berlin, Germany, main emission line at 254 nm, intensity of 0.66 W m-2). For \n\neach spectral region tested, the samples were irradiated to their LD50 (UV dose resulting \n\nin 50 % inactivation). UV sources were placed at 20 cm from the sample. UV intensities \n\nwere measured with a monochromator spectro-radiometer placed at the sample level \n\n(DM 300, Bentham Instruments, Reading, UK) and the UV dose (in J m-2) was \n\ncalculated by multiplying the intensity by the irradiation time (in seconds). \n\nDuring irradiation, samples were stirred by magnetic agitation and temperature \n\nwas kept at approximately 25 \u00baC. A dark control (covered in aluminum foil) treated in \n\nthe same way as the irradiated samples was included in every experiment. Aliquots of \n\ncell suspensions were collected before and after irradiation, washed with ultrapure water \n\nand immediately used for lipid and protein extraction. For every irradiation treatment, \n\nexperiments were repeated in three independent assays with three biological replicates. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n99 \n\nDark controls (covered in aluminium foil), treated in the same way as the irradiated \n\nsamples, were included in every experiment. \n\n \n\nLipid extraction \n\nTotal lipid extracts were obtained according to standard protocols (Bligh and \n\nDyer, 1959). Briefly, irradiated and unirradiated cell suspensions were centrifuged and \n\nthe pellet was washed with pure desalted water. The suspensions were centrifuged again \n\nand the supernatant discarded. A volume of 125 \u00b5 L of chloroform and 250 \u00b5 L of \n\nmethanol was added to the pellet and the mixture was vortexed vigorously. Then, 8.4 \n\n\u00b5 L of hydrochloric acid (6 M) and 125 \u00b5 L of chloroform were added and the mixture \n\nvortexed again. Finally, 125 \u00b5 L of pure desalted water were added, the solution was \n\nvortexed again, and centrifuged for 20 min at 300 x g. Total lipid extract was collected \n\nin the lower phase and immediately used for spectra acquisition. \n\n \n\nProtein extraction \n\nProteins were extracted according to previously described procedures (Ojanen et \n\nal., 1993). Briefly, irradiated and unirradiated cell suspensions were centrifuged and the \n\npellets were resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The suspension was sonicated in \n\nan ice bath four times for 5 s using a sonifier (Branson 450, Danbury, CT, USA), \n\nfollowed by a centrifugation step at 15,000 x g for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. The pellet was \n\nresuspended with 10 mL of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and sarcosyl (Sigma, St. Louis, \n\nMO, USA) was added to a final concentration of 1.5 % (v/v). After incubation at room \n\ntemperature for 20 min, the protein extract was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 x g \n\nfor 90 min at 4 \u00b0C and suspended in ultrapure water. \n\n \n\nSpectra acquisition and analysis \n\nMid-infrared spectra were obtained using a GoldenGate single reflection \n\ndiamond ATR system in an infrared (IR) spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer Spectrum BX \n\nSystem 2000) equipped with a DTGS detector. Measurements were recorded over the \n\nwavelength range of 4000 to 700 cm-1 with a spectral resolution of 8 cm-1. The final \n\nspectra of the samples were achieved averaging 32 scans. A total of 6 spectra were used \n\nfor chemometric analysis. Spectra were normalized and baseline-corrected and then \n\nused to obtain difference spectra (irradiated minus control) using OPUS version 6.5 \n\nsoftware (Bruker, Germany). Additionally, the original spectra were transferred via \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n100 \n\nJCAMP.DX format into the data analysis software package described in Barros (1999) \n\nfor Principal Component Analysis (PCA). \n\n \n\nResults and discussion \n\nFig. 6.1 (A to D) shows the original mid-infrared spectra of the extracted lipids \n\nand proteins of Acinetobacter sp. PT5I1.2G and Pseudomonas sp. NT5I1.2B. In order to \n\ngain further insights into the modifications induced by the different UV treatments in \n\nlipids and proteins, difference spectra were calculated by subtracting the controls to the \n\nirradiated spectra. Difference spectra are shown in Fig. 6.2 and Fig. 6.4. In the resultant \n\nirradiated-minus-control difference spectra, upward-moving bands correspond to mid-\n\ninfrared bands that appear (or increase in intensity) after irradiation, while downward-\n\nmoving bands correspond to mid-infrared bands that disappear (or decrease in intensity) \n\nupon irradiation. \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \nFig. 6.1. Original spectra of lipid extracts of (A) Acinetobacter sp. PT5I1.2G, (B) Pseudomonas sp. NT5I1.2B, and protein extracts \n\nof (C) Acinetobacter sp. PT5I1.2G, (D) Pseudomonas sp. NT5I1.2B. The main bands detected in the original spectra are identified. \n\nThe spectra were normalized, baseline-corrected and a 13-point smooth was applied. The presented spectra correspond to the \n\naverage of 6 replicate spectra. Spectra are shown offset to facilitate visualization. The region between 2400-2200 cm-1 \n\ncorresponding to the CO2 region was removed from the spectra. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n101 \n\nUV effects on lipids \n\nIn general, exposure to the different UV spectral regions resulted in similar \n\noverall effects on the lipids of the two strains tested. These effects included a drastic \n\ndecrease in intensity of bands assigned to lipoproteins and/or nitrogen-containing lipids \n\n(? 3290 cm-1, ? 1650 cm-1 and ? 1540 cm-1) (Fig. 6.2). Lipoproteins are known to be \n\nsusceptible to oxidative damage, due to the presence of aromatic side chains residues \n\n(such as tryptophan or tyrosine) that act as chromophores during photosensitized \n\nreactions (Esterbauer et al., 1987; Salmon et al., 1990). Therefore, reducing the amount \n\nof lipoproteins in the cell could be a mechanism to minimize oxidative damage. \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \nFig. 6.2. Difference spectra (irradiated-minus-control) for the lipid extracts of Acinetobacter sp. PT5I1.2G under UVA (A), UVB \n\n(B) and UVC (C) and Pseudomonas sp. NT5I1.2B under UVA (D), UVB (E) and UVC (F). A 13-point smooth was applied to the \n\ndifference spectra. The region between 2400-2200 cm-1, corresponding to the CO2 region, was removed from the spectra. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n102 \n\nOn the other hand, it is also possible that photosensitized reactions occurring in \n\nthe protein fraction of the molecule could have interfered with lipid-protein interactions, \n\nresulting in the dissociation of the lipid and protein moieties of the molecules (Salmon \n\net al., 1990). As a result, during the process of lipid extraction, proteins previously \n\nassociated with lipids could have been lost. \n\nExposure to UV radiation of different wavelengths also resulted in an increase in \n\nintensity of methyl bands (? 2950 cm-1, ? 2870 cm-1, ? 1460 cm-1, ? 1380 cm-1) (Fig. \n\n6.2). This effect was particularly accentuated in UVC-treated Acinetobacter sp. \n\nPT5I1.2G (Fig. 6.2 C). Increasing methyl groups disrupts the packing of acyl chains and \n\nreduces the number of interactions in the membrane, leading to enhanced membrane \n\nfluidity (Zhang and Rock, 2008). Changes in membrane fluidity can also be inferred by \n\nthe change in frequency of methylene bands at ? 2920 cm-1 and ? 2850 cm-1 that can be \n\nobserved in the original spectra. Altered membrane fluidity, mediated by the expression \n\nof specific membrane proteins, have been shown to have a positive effect on cellular \n\nadaptation of Oenococcus oeni to stress (Delmas et al., 2001). Changes in membrane \n\nfluidity have also been associated with signal transduction involved in the activation of \n\nintracellular mechanisms of protection, following exposure to stress factors. For \n\nexample, in plants, membrane fluidization is implicated in the activation of the heat-\n\nshock response (Sangwan et al., 2002). Whether such a mechanism could be involved in \n\nthe response of bacteria to UV radiation is unknown. Additionally, changes in \n\nphospholipid composition of the cell, consistent with the observed changes in the band \n\nat 1740 cm-1 assigned to esters of fatty acids (Rothschild et al., 1980), could also explain \n\nthe increase in methyl bands verified in irradiated samples.  \n\nIn most cases, UV exposure also resulted in oxidative damage to lipids, denoted \n\nby the increased intensity of bands at 1018 cm-1 assigned to O-O bonds of \n\nhydroperoxides (Merle et al., 2010), 972 cm-1 assigned to trans C = C bonds (Le Dr\u00e9au \n\net al., 2009), as well as 1402 cm-1 assigned to carboxyl groups formed during the \n\noxidation process (Nadtochenko et al., 2005) and 888 cm-1 assigned to CH2 and CH3 \n\nrocking modes of oxidized lipids (Nadtochenko et al., 2005). In the case of UVC-treated \n\nAcinetobacter sp. PT5I1.2G there was also an increase in intensity of a band at 1720 \n\ncm-1 (Fig. 6.2 C), reflecting the possible formation of aldehydes due to lipid \n\nperoxidation (Le Dr\u00e9au et al., 2009). In Acinetobacter sp. PT5I1.2G (Fig. 6.2 A-C) \n\neffects on oxidative damage marker bands were noted mostly under UVC, while in \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n103 \n\nPseudomonas sp. NT5I1.2B oxidation seemed to occur under every spectral region (Fig. \n\n6.2 D-F).  \n\nIn the case of Pseudomonas sp. NT5I1.2B exposed to UVB, a marked increase \n\nin the area between 1200-900 cm-1 and a general increase in the area between 3000 and \n\n3500 cm-1, dominated by OH bands particularly associated with polysaccharides \n\n(Gonzaga et al., 2005), as well as a decrease in all the CH region (3000 to 2800 cm-1) \n\nand the ester carbonyl band (1740 cm-1), were observed. Together, these observations \n\nsuggest an alteration in the lipid composition of the cell, with an increase in the relative \n\nabundance of glycolipids in detriment of fatty acids. A relative increase in glycolipids \n\ncould contribute to enhance the stability of the cell membrane when confronted with \n\nenvironmental changes due to the ability of these compounds to undergo interlipid \n\nhydrogen bonding via glycosyl headgroups (Curatolo, 1987) and has been reported in \n\nthe response of bacteria to acid stress and temperature shifts (Hunter et al., 1981; \n\nFern\u00e1ndez Murga et al., 2000; Taranto et al., 2006). On the other hand, Pseudomonas \n\nspecies are known to produce extracellular glycophospholipids containing fatty acids \n\nwith 10 and 12 carbons (Silipo et al., 2002; Andolfi et al., 2008). The production of \n\nsuch kind of compound could also account for the increase in glycolipids and at the \n\nsame time explain the smaller effects of UVB on the lipoproteins of Pseudomonas sp. in \n\nthe UVB treatment (Fig. 6.2 E), since these molecules contain amide links (Silipo et al., \n\n2002). \n\nPCA scores and loadings plots of the analysis of the spectra of lipids of \n\nAcinetobacter sp. PT5I1.2G exposed to the different irradiation regimes are presented in \n\nFig. 6.3 A and 6.3 B. The PCA score plot revealed a clear separation between control \n\nand irradiated samples along PC1, while the different wavelength treatments were \n\nseparated along PC2. Among the different irradiation regimes, UVA and UVC were \n\nfound together in negative PC2, whereas UVB was in positive PC2. Control samples \n\n(negative PC1) were separated from irradiated samples (positive PC1) by higher \n\nintensity of bands assigned to ester carbonyls from phospholipids and triglycerides \n\n(1740 cm-1), amide I and amide II of lipoproteins (1654, 1546 cm-1) as well as bands \n\nassigned to phospholipids and/or glycolipids (1230, 1074 cm-1). Irradiated samples \n\ndisplayed enhanced intensity of methyl bands (2954 and 1460 cm-1) as well as bands \n\nassociated with lipid peroxidation products, including trans C = C bonds (970 cm-1) and \n\nCH2 and CH3 rocking modes of oxidized lipids (888 cm\n-1). Therefore, PCA confirmed \n\nthe involvement of changes in lipid composition and/or structure, as well as effects \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n104 \n\nexerted on lipoproteins and/or nitrogen-containing lipids, in differentiating irradiated \n\nand non-irradiated samples, as suggested from the analysis of difference spectra. \n\n  \n\n \n \n\nFig. 6.3. Scores and loading plots for PCA analysis of lipid extracts irradiated with different UV spectral regions of Acinetobacter \n\nsp. PT5I1.2G (A, B) and Pseudomonas sp. NT5I1.2B (C, D). \n\n \n\nThe different UV treatments were discriminated mostly along PC2 being UVB \n\nirradiated samples characterized by higher intensity of bands assigned to methylene \n\ngroups (2914 cm-1, 2846 cm-1), ester groups of phospholipids and triglycerides (1740 \n\ncm-1) and nitrogen-containing lipids and/or lipoproteins (1654, 1546 cm-1), while UVC-\n\ntreated samples were mostly differentiated by higher intensity of bands assigned to \n\nphospholipids and/or glycolipids (1214, 1158 cm-1) and oxidation products (888 cm-1). \n\nPCA scores and loadings plots of the spectra of the lipids of Pseudomonas sp. \n\nNT5I1.2B are presented in Fig. 6.3 C and 6.3 D. Contrary to what was observed in \n\nAcinetobacter sp. PT5I1.2G, PCA analysis of the lipids of Pseudomonas sp. NT5I1.2B \n\nin the different irradiation regimes did not show a clear separation between controls and \n\nirradiated samples, with the UVB treatment located together with the control samples in \n\nnegative PC1, and separated from the remaining UV regimes located in positive PC1. \n\nControl and UVB-treated samples were differentiated from UVA-treated samples by \n\nenhanced intensity of bands assigned to carbonyl ester groups of phospholipids and \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n105 \n\ntriglycerides (1740 cm-1), N-H stretching vibrations of amide and amine (3300 and 1656 \n\ncm-1) and bands assigned to phospholipids and glycolipids (1216, 1180 cm-1), while \n\nUVA-treated samples were differentiated by enhanced intensity of CH3 bands (2940 cm\n-\n\n1) and bands associated with lipid oxidation products (888 cm-1). PC2 basically \n\nseparated the UVC treatment from UVA-irradiated samples and controls. Separation of \n\nthese sets of samples was mostly associated with bands assigned to CH bonds (2940, \n\n2926, 2896, 2842, 1458, 1378 cm-1), esters of phospholipids (1740 cm-1) as well as \n\nlipoproteins and/or nitrogen-containing lipids (1656 and 1544 cm-1). \n\nTaken together, PCA results identify methyl and/or methylene groups associated \n\nwith lipids, as well as lipoproteins and/or nitrogen-containing lipids, as targets of UV \n\nradiation. Additionally, variations in bands assigned to phospholipids and/or glycolipids \n\nwere also observed denoting changes on bacterial lipid composition upon exposure to \n\nUV radiation. Altered lipid composition can be a result of UV-induced damage to lipid \n\nmetabolic pathways, for example, damage to enzymes involved in lipid synthesis. On \n\nthe other hand, changes in lipid composition may also reflect a metabolic strategy of \n\nbacteria to cope with UV radiation. For instance, the general decrease in the relative \n\nabundance of phospho- and glycolipids in UV-treated samples, revealed in PCA results, \n\ncould possibly be explained by the high susceptibility of unsaturated fatty acids to \n\noxidative damage (Panagopoulos et al., 1990; Kramer et al., 1991). Decreased \n\nphospholipid and glycolipid content was also reported in the marine cyanobacteria \n\nPhormidium tenue in response to UV radiation and attributed to oxidative damage of the \n\nmembrane (Bhandari and Sharma, 2011). Alternatively, UV-induced changes in the \n\nallocation of elements to biomolecules could also account for the observed changes in \n\nthe relative proportion of phospho- and glycolipids with irradiation. Bacteria are known \n\nto replace their phospholipids with membrane lipids that do not contain any phosphorus \n\nin response to phosphorus limitation, so that less phosphorus is consumed for the \n\nformation of membranes (L\u00f3pez-Lara et al., 2005). A reduction in phosphorus directed \n\nto membranes could be a mechanism elicited in order to ensure that enough phosphate \n\nsupply is present for cellular repair strategies, such as nucleotide excision repair, which \n\nrequires ATP (Batty and Wood, 2000).  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n106 \n\nUV effects on proteins \n\nUV irradiated samples were characterized by increased intensity of methyl (? \n\n2950 cm-1) and particularly methylene (? 2920 cm-1, ?2850 cm-1) bands associated with \n\nproteins and amino acids, especially in Acinetobacter sp. PT5I1.2G (Fig. 6.4 A-C). The \n\nobserved increase in intensity of methylene bands associated with proteins and amino \n\nacids with irradiation could be attributed to changes in protein composition, specifically, \n\nan increase in the relative proportion of amino acids rich in CH2 groups, like proline, \n\nlysine, isoleucine, glutamine or glutamic acid. The concentration of proline has been \n\nshown to increase upon UV exposure in the green algae Scenedesmus quadricauda and \n\nhypothesized to be a stress-defence response (Kov\u00e1?ik et al., 2010).  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \nFig. 6.4. Difference spectra (irradiated-minus-control) for the protein extracts of Acinetobacter sp. PT5I1.2G under UVA (A), UVB \n\n(B) and UVC (C) and Pseudomonas sp. NT5I1.2B under UVA (D), UVB (E) and UVC (F). A 13-point smooth was applied to the \n\ndifference spectra. The region between 2400-2200 cm-1, corresponding to the CO2 region, was removed from the spectra. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n107 \n\nAdditionally, enhanced intensity of bands assigned to methyl and methylene \n\nstretching vibrations can arise as a result of the introduction of CH3 and CH2 groups \n\nduring the process of propionylation of lysine residues (Singh et al., 2012). However, \n\nthe fact that lysine is not an strong infrared absorber and that its two main bands located \n\nnear 1626 cm-1 and 1526 cm-1 are hidden by the amide I and amide II bands, \n\nrespectively (Barth, 2000), limits further analysis. Propionylation is involved in the \n\nregulation of the activity of some enzymes in bacteria (Garrity et al., 2007). Whether \n\nthis process could play a role in the metabolic response of bacteria to UV-induced stress \n\nis unknown. \n\nMid-infrared spectroscopy also revealed a decrease in the intensity of bands \n\nassigned to aromatic amino acids, most notably tyrosine (1518 cm-1) and tryptophan \n\n(1452 cm-1) in all Acinetobacter sp. PT5I1.2G irradiated samples (Fig. 6.4 A-C) and in \n\nUVB-irradiated Pseudomonas sp. NT5I1.2B (Fig. 6.4 E). This decrease can be \n\nattributed to oxidative modifications of amino acid side chains (Lasch et al., 2001), that \n\nhave also been observed upon exposure of cells to hydrogen peroxide and gamma-\n\nirradiation (Gault et al., 2005). Additionally, it is known that, at least in Escherichia \n\ncoli, exposure to severe oxidative stress results in the inability of the cell to synthesize \n\naromatic amino acids (Benov and Fridovich, 1999). Therefore, the observed decrease in \n\nintensity of mid-infrared bands associated with tyrosine and tryptophan can also be \n\nattributed to decreased synthesis of aromatic amino acids upon exposure to UV \n\nradiation.  \n\nUV exposure also caused a general decrease in the intensity of the main bands \n\ndetected in the region between 1200-900 cm-1. This spectral region comprises vibrations \n\nof amino acids, as well as sugar and phosphate moieties associated with glycosylated \n\nand phosphorylated proteins. Understanding the modifications in this region in response \n\nto UV radiation is, therefore, more difficult. Possible explanations for the observed \n\nchanges in this spectral region include decreased protein phosphorylation levels, which \n\nhave been found to occur in Xanthomonas oryzae upon UVC exposure (Huang et al., \n\n1995) and/or decreased protein glycosylation. Protein glycosylation is known to be \n\ninvolved in the regulation of the activity of specific proteins, including the RecA protein \n\nwhich mediates the SOS response of bacteria (Fischer and Haas, 2004). Whether \n\ndecreased protein glycosylation levels fulfil a physiological role in the response of \n\nbacteria to UV radiation is unknown.  \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n108 \n\nA substantial increase in intensity of the N-H bands around 3300 and 1650 cm-1 \n\nwas observed in Acinetobacter sp. PT5I1.2G exposed to UVA (Fig. 6.4 A) and \n\nPseudomonas sp. NT5I1.2B exposed to UVB (Fig. 6.4 E), potentially denoting the \n\naccumulation of protein oxidation products, such as kynurenine which results from the \n\noxidation of tryptophan. This is also consistent with the observed decrease in intensity \n\nof the tryptophan band at 1452 cm-1. Additionally, ROS-mediated conversion of \n\nhistidine to asparagine (Cabiscol et al., 2000) could also account for the increase in the \n\nintensity of N-H bands. \n\nAll irradiation treatments resulted in changes in the intensity and/or frequency of \n\nthe component bands of amide I, which characterize the secondary structure of proteins, \n\nthus denoting changes in protein conformation with irradiation. Conformational changes \n\nin proteins upon UV exposure may be elicited in order to protect sensitive amino acid \n\nresidues from direct UV-induced damage. For example, the proteins involved in \n\nprotecting spore DNA from UV damage undergo a major conformational change upon \n\nbinding to DNA (Hayes et al., 2000), which protects the protein against methionine \n\noxidation and asparagine deamidation (Hayes and Setlow, 1997; Hayes et al., 1998). \n\nProtein conformational changes may also be involved in eliciting stress mechanisms and \n\nrepair strategies, as observed in the case of the activation of the OxyR regulon which \n\ninitiates the bacterial response to oxidative stress (Demple, 1991). Changes in bands \n\ncharacteristic of the secondary structure of proteins can also arise as a result of oxidative \n\nmodifications of amino acid side chains, conformational stability alteration and/or \n\naggregation of proteins (Lasch et al., 2001). Besides altered protein conformation due to \n\nUV-induced damage, it is also possible that synthesis of proteins with different \n\nconformation, including proteins involved in DNA repair, ROS scavenging, iron \n\nhomeostasis and chaperones (Matallana-Surget et al., 2009a; Bosshard et al., 2010b), \n\nmay have occurred in response to UV radiation, and contributed for the observed \n\nchanges in the amide I band. \n\nUV exposure also resulted in variable changes in the intensity of carboxylate \n\nbands. In the case of UVB- and UVC-treated Acinetobacter sp. PT5I1.2G, an increase \n\nin the intensity of the carboxylate bands (1590 and 1390 cm-1) was observed, which can \n\nreflect the occurrence of deamidation of asparagine and glutamine. This process can \n\nalter the tertiary structure of the protein and affect its biological properties and has been \n\nassociated with a number of stress conditions, including UV exposure (D'Angelo et al., \n\n2001). In vivo deamidation of proteins can be used as a mechanism to initiate the \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n109 \n\nproduction of unique proteins of biological significance (Robinson and Robinson, \n\n2001). Whether such mechanism could be involved in the coordination of the response \n\nof bacteria to UV radiation is unknown. \n\nPCA analysis of the protein spectra of Acinetobacter sp. PT5I1.2G showed a \n\ngeneral separation between control and UVB-treated samples (negative PC1) and UVA- \n\nand UVC-treated samples (positive PC1) (Fig. 6.5 A, B). UVA- and UVC-treated \n\nsamples were characterized by enhanced intensity of the N-H band (3294 cm-1) and \n\namide I band (1652 cm-1), potentially denoting the accumulation of protein oxidation \n\nproducts, while control and UVB-treated samples were characterized by enhanced \n\nintensity of bands assigned to the aromatic amino acid tyrosine (1518 cm-1) and CH3 \n\ndeformation of amino acids (1380 cm-1), as well as bands assigned to phosphorylated \n\nand/or glycosylated proteins (1084, 1064 cm-1). PC2 separated UVC-treated samples \n\nfrom the remaining irradiation regimes and was mostly associated with enhanced \n\nintensity of CH2 bands and carboxylate bands (1594, 1392 cm\n-1) in UVC-treated \n\nsamples, while the remaining irradiation regimes were characterized by enhanced \n\nintensity of the N-H band (3294 cm-1), tyrosine band (1518 cm-1) and bands assigned to \n\nphosphorylated and/or glycosylated proteins (1084, 1064 cm-1).  \n\n  \n\n  \nFig. 6.5. Scores and loading plots for PCA analysis of protein extracts irradiated with different UV spectral regions of Acinetobacter \n\nsp. PT5I1.2G (A, B) and Pseudomonas sp. NT5I1.2B (C, D). \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n110 \n\nIn Pseudomonas sp, PCA analysis showed the separation of control and UVC-\n\ntreated samples (negative PC1) from UVA- and UVB-treated samples (positive PC1) \n\n(Fig. 6.5 C, D). Separation along PC1 was mostly due to bands 2924 and 2854 cm-1 \n\nassigned to CH2 bands, as well as amide I (1656 cm\n-1) and the carboxylate band at 1596 \n\ncm-1 which were enhanced in UVA- and UVB-treated samples. Control and UVC-\n\ntreated samples showed enhanced intensity of amide II (1532 cm-1), as well as enhanced \n\nintensity of bands assigned to phosphorylated and/or glycosylated proteins (1218, 1042 \n\ncm-1). PC2 mostly separated UVA- and UVC-treated samples (negative PC2) from \n\nUVB-treated samples (positive PC2). Bands contributing the most for the separation \n\nalong PC2 included 3294 cm-1 (N-H band), 1656 cm-1 (amide I) and bands assigned to \n\nphosphorylated and/or glycosylated proteins (1222, 1048 cm-1), which were enhanced in \n\nUVB-treated samples. Bands assigned to CH2 groups (2924, 2854 cm\n-1) and carboxylate \n\ngroups (1590 and 1394 cm-1) were enhanced in UVA- and UVC-treated samples.  \n\nTaken together these results highlight the involvement of changes in protein \n\nsecondary structure, aromatic amino acids, protein phosphorylation, glycosylation \n\nand/or propionylation levels, as well as the potential formation of protein oxidation \n\nproducts, in the effects of UV irradiation in the two bacteria. \n\n \n\nInterspecific variability in UV effects on lipids and proteins \n\nWhile, in general, the two strains tested shared common effects upon exposure \n\nto each UV spectral region, substantial differences also occurred. For example, while \n\neffects of UVA radiation on the lipids of the two strains tested were very similar, effects \n\nof UVB differed considerably, particularly in the bands corresponding to lipoproteins \n\nand/or nitrogen-containing lipids (3300, 1650, 1540 cm-1) and the CH region (3000-\n\n2800 cm-1). UVC effects also showed some differences between strains, particularly in \n\nthe region between 1300-800 cm-1. Regarding proteins, differences of the effects of each \n\nspectral region in the two strains were mostly associated to effects on the N-H band (? \n\n3300 cm-1), carboxylate band (? 1590 cm-1), amide I component bands and tyrosine \n\nband (1518 cm-1). \n\nDifferences in the original lipid and protein composition of the two strains can \n\ncontribute to explain the different effects of each spectral region in each strain. For \n\nexample, enhanced abundance of unsaturated fatty acids, highly susceptible to oxidative \n\ndamage, can make bacteria more sensitive to photoreactions elicited by UV exposure \n\n(Ferreri and Chatgilialoglu, 2009). On the other hand, high abundance of aromatic \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n111 \n\namino acids, which act as chromophores during photosensitized reactions (Pattison and \n\nDavies, 2006), might also render bacteria more susceptible to UV radiation. \n\nAlternatively, differences in the efficiency of defence mechanisms elicited to counteract \n\nthe damage induced to proteins and lipids can also contribute to the differences \n\nobserved in the type of damage produced by the same spectral region in the different \n\nstrains. Further studies using complementary approaches to mid-infrared spectroscopy, \n\nsuch as mass spectrometry-based lipidomics and proteomics analysis, will help to \n\nexplore the hypothesis emerging in the present study in order to gain further insights \n\ninto the mechanisms of UV-based bacterial inactivation. \n\n \n\nConclusions \n\nIn the present work, the effects of exposure to UV radiation of different spectral \n\nregions on the lipids and proteins of two bacterial strains with distinct UV sensitivities \n\nwere studied by mid-infrared spectroscopy. Exposure to UV radiation of different \n\nspectral regions caused a general increase in lipid methylation, accompanied by \n\noxidative modifications and potentially altered lipid composition. Effects of UV \n\nradiation on proteins included changes in protein conformation and/or composition, \n\noxidative damage to amino acid side chain residues and potentially changes in the \n\npropionylation, glycosylation and/or phosphorylation status of cellular proteins. \n\nWhether such modifications reflect UV-induced damage to biomolecules or could \n\nactually be the basis of a UV-stress response mechanism in bacteria is unknown and \n\nwarrants further research.  \n\nInfrared spectroscopy was proven to be an excellent tool to study changes in \n\nbacterial components upon UV exposure, providing detailed clues to drive future studies \n\nconcerning the mechanisms involved in the inactivation of bacteria by UV irradiation.  \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nFinancial support for this work was provided by Centre for Environmental and Marine Studies (CESAM) \n\n(project Pest-C/MAR/LA0017/2011), University of Aveiro and the Portuguese Foundation for Science \n\nand Technology (FCT) in the form of a PhD grant to A.

L., Gomes N. C. M., Henriques I., Almeida A., Correia A., Cunha A. \n\nJournal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology 117: 40-46 \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nThe present work aimed to identify the reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced \n\nduring UVB exposure and their biochemical targets, in a set of bacterial isolates \n\ndisplaying different UV susceptibilities. For that, specific exogenous ROS scavengers \n\n(catalase/CAT, superoxide dismutase/SOD, sodium azide and mannitol) were used. \n\nBiological effects were assessed from total bacterial number, colony counts and \n\nheterotrophic activity (glucose uptake and respiration). DNA strand breakage, ROS \n\ngeneration, oxidative damage to proteins and lipids were used as markers of oxidative \n\nstress. Sodium azide conferred a statistically significant protection in terms of lipid \n\noxidation and cell survival, suggesting that singlet oxygen might play an important role \n\nin UVB-induced cell inactivation. Mannitol exerted a significant protection against \n\nDNA strand breakage and protein carbonylation, assigning hydroxyl radicals to DNA \n\nand protein damage. The addition of exogenous CAT and SOD significantly protected \n\nthe capacity for glucose uptake and respiration, suggesting that superoxide and H2O2 are \n\ninvolved in the impairment of activity during UVB exposure. The observation that \n\namendment with ROS scavengers can sometimes also exert a pro-oxidant effect \n\nsuggests that the intracellular oxidant status of the cell ultimately determines the \n\nefficiency of antioxidant defences. \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\nUVB radiation represents the most cytotoxic waveband of solar radiation \n\nreaching the Earth\u2019s surface, causing several structural and physiological effects in \n\naquatic organisms (Moran and Zepp, 2000; Bancroft et al., 2007). UVB-induced \n\ndamage to biological systems has traditionally been attributed to the direct absorption of \n\nUV photons by nucleic acids, resulting in lesions (photoproducts) that block DNA \n\nreplication and RNA transcription and can ultimately lead to cell death (Mitchell and \n\nKarentz, 1993). Additionally, damage can also arise indirectly via photosensitization \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n114 \n\nprocesses involving the absorption of UV light by an endogenous or exogenous \n\nphotosensitizer (Muela et al., 2002; Bolton et al., 2010). The electronically excited \n\nsensitizer can harmlessly revert back to its ground state via intramolecular decay \n\nprocesses or can damage other cellular material via reactive oxygen species (ROS) \n\n(Pattison and Davies, 2006). \n\nCellular damage by photosensitization can occur by two major pathways, often \n\ncalled type I and type II mechanisms. In the type I process, the electronically excited \n\nsensitizer reacts directly with the cellular component, subtracting one electron or \n\nhydrogen atom from the cellular target, resulting in free radical formation (e.g., \n\nsuperoxide ions and hydroxyl radicals) which initiate free radical chain reactions. Type \n\nII mechanism involves energy transfer from the sensitizer to molecular oxygen with the \n\nconsequent formation of an excited state of oxygen, singlet oxygen (Pattison and \n\nDavies, 2006). As a consequence of photosensitization, several cytotoxic reactions are \n\ntriggered in the cells, including disruption of cell membrane, inactivation of different \n\nenzymes and damage of DNA that can eventually lead to cell death (Luksiene, 2003; \n\nDemidova and Hamblin, 2004; Luksiene, 2005). \n\nSeveral studies addressing the effects of UV radiation in aquatic bacteria have \n\nreported extensive variability in the UV sensitivity of bacteria (Joux et al., 1999; Arrieta \n\net al., 2000; Santos et al., 2011b; Santos et al., 2012a), which can affect the structure \n\nand functioning of aquatic bacterial communities faced with changes in environmental \n\nUV levels. However, the observed variability does not seem to be supported by \n\ndifferences in the extent of DNA damage among different bacteria (Joux et al., 1999), \n\nsuggesting that heterogeneity in susceptibility to UVB radiation could be due to \n\ndifferences in: (i) the type and magnitude of oxidative damage, (ii) the ability to cope \n\nwith oxidative damage, and/or (iii) differences in the ROS involved in eliciting the \n\ndamage in different bacteria. Furthermore, unlike DNA photoproducts, which can be \n\neffectively reversed through the process of photoreactivation, enhanced ROS production \n\nduring UVB exposure and subsequent oxidative damage can have far wider \n\nconsequences, since oxidative damage to biomolecules is energetically expensive to \n\nprevent and repair (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1999). However, the identity and role of \n\nROS involved in UVB-induced damage to different bacteria remains mostly unknown.  \n\nThe objectives of this work were to ascertain the identity and the targets of ROS \n\ninvolved in UVB-induced damage using specific exogenous ROS scavengers and \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n115 \n\nmonitoring their effects on biological and biochemical parameters in a set of \n\nphylogenetically distinct bacterial isolates with different UVB sensitivities. \n\n \n\nMaterials and methods \n\nBacterial isolates \n\nThe bacterial strains used in this study (Table 7.1) are representatives of the four \n\nculturable bacterial groups (Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, \n\nActinobacteria and Firmicutes) retrieved after irradiation of samples from the surface \n\nlayers of an estuarine system (Ria de Aveiro, Portugal) (Santos et al., 2012a) and thus \n\nconsidered to represent the most relevant culturable members of a UV-stressed \n\ncommunity. The isolates were grown in Marine Broth 2216 (Difco, Detroit, MI) at 25 \n\n\u00baC with agitation (120 rpm). In the late-exponential phase (usually achieved in 8-14 h), \n\ncells were harvested by centrifugation (3,200 x g for 15 min, Thermo Scientific Heraeus \n\nPico 21 Microcentrifuge, Hamburg, Germany). Cells were washed and resuspended in \n\n0.2-\u00b5 m-pore-size-filtered autoclaved 0.9 % NaCl solution and bacterial abundance was \n\nadjusted with filtered autoclaved 0.9 % NaCl to 106 cells mL-1. Cell suspensions (30 \n\nmL) were transferred to sterile Petri dishes (150 x 25 mm; Corning) and irradiated \n\n(without the lid) with UVB (Philips TL 100 W/01 lamps, main emission line of 302 \n\nnm). Aliquots of cell suspensions were collected at pre-determined times to construct \n\nthe inactivation curves, which were used to determine the LD50 (UVB dose necessary \n\nfor the inactivation of 50 % of bacteria). UV intensities were measured with a \n\nmonochromator spectro-radiometer placed at the sample level (DM 300, Bentham \n\nInstruments, Reading, UK).  \n\n \n\nTable 7.1.

Firmicutes 37.0 \n\n \n\nIn order to identify the different ROS involved in UVB-induced damage and \n\nassess their impact on bacterial survival and activity (glucose uptake and respiration), \n\ncell suspensions were amended with the exogenous scavengers sodium azide (specific \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n116 \n\nsinglet oxygen scavenger), mannitol (specific hydroxyl radical scavenger), \n\ncatalase/CAT (specific hydrogen peroxide scavenger) and superoxide dismutase/SOD \n\n(specific superoxide radical scavenger). Stock solutions of antioxidants were prepared \n\nin PBS and 0.2-\u00b5 m-filter-sterilized, stored and used at a final concentration of 10 mM in \n\nthe cases of sodium azide and mannitol, and at a 50 U mL\u20131 concentration for SOD and \n\n20 U mL-1 for CAT. These concentrations were chosen from preliminary experiments, \n\nas those that resulted in the highest reduction of intracellular ROS levels and minimal \n\ninhibition of the cells (data not shown). The cells were pre-incubated with the \n\nantioxidants for 30 min at room temperature in the dark, with agitation (120 rpm), after \n\nwhich cells were washed and resuspended in double distilled water (Joshi et al., 2011). \n\nCell suspensions were irradiated at UVB LD50 (50.1 kJ m\n-2 for Micrococcus sp., 40.3 kJ \n\nm-2 for Paracoccus sp., 49.3 kJ m-2 for Pseudomonas sp. and 37.0 kJ m-2 for \n\nStaphylococcus sp.) (Table 7.1). Aliquots for biological and biochemical analysis were \n\ncollected before and after irradiation. During irradiation, temperature was kept at 25 \u00baC. \n\nNon-irradiated dark controls (cell suspensions unamended and amended with each \n\ntested scavenger), otherwise treated in the same way as the irradiated samples, were \n\nincluded in every experiment.  \n\nFor the determination of protein content and protein carbonyl levels, cell \n\nhomogenates were prepared by collecting cells by centrifugation immediately after \n\nirradiation, resuspending them in cold 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) \n\ncontaining 1 mM EDTA, followed by sonication in ice (Branson Instruments Co. \n\nSonifier, Stamford, Conn.; 2 min, 30-s pulses, 1-min cooling). Homogenates were \n\nstored at -80 \u00baC until the measurements. All experiments were repeated in three \n\nindependent assays. Parameters were always determined in a minimum of three \n\nanalytical replicates. Positive (H2O2-treated) and negative (untreated) controls were \n\nalways included and processed along experimental samples in order to ensure proper \n\nfunctioning of the procedures.  \n\n \n\nColony counts \n\nBefore and after each treatment, sample aliquots were serially-diluted in filter-\n\nsterilized, autoclaved 0.9 % NaCl and spread-plated in triplicate on marine agar 2216 \n\nplates (Difco, Detroit, MI). The number of colony forming units per mL (CFU mL-1) \n\nwas counted after 3 days of incubation at 25 \u00baC in the dark. The dilution and plating \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n117 \n\nprocedures were carried out under low-luminosity conditions to minimize \n\nphotoreactivation. \n\n \n\nTotal bacterial number (TBN) \n\nFor the determination of total bacterial numbers, samples were filtered through \n\n0.2-\u00b5 m-pore-size black polycarbonate membranes (Poretics, Livermore, CA, USA), and \n\nstained with 0.03 % (w/v) acridine orange (Hobbie et al., 1977). Cells were counted by \n\nepifluorescence microscopy using a Leitz Laborlux K microscope (Leitz Me?technik, \n\nWetzlar, Germany) equipped with a I 2/3 filter for blue light. At least 200 cells or 20 \n\nmicroscope fields were counted in each of three replicate membranes.  \n\n \n\nGlucose incorporation and respiration \n\nThe effects of UV radiation on bacterial activity were estimated from glucose \n\nincorporation and respiration. Triplicate 10 mL aliquots of bacterial suspension plus a 2 \n\n% (vol/vol) formalin-fixed control were incubated with [14C]glucose (Amersham \n\nBiosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK; SA 310 mCi mmol?1). The tracer concentration \n\nwas 8.1 nM. Samples were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 2 h, after \n\nwhich incubations were stopped by adding 2 % formalin (vol/vol) (Sigma, St. Louis, \n\nMO, USA). Samples for glucose incorporation were filtered through nitrocellulose \n\nfilters (0.2-\u00b5m-pore-size; Millipore, Tokyo, Japan) and rinsed three times with chilled 5 \n\n% trichloroacetic acid. For the determination of bacterial respiration, samples were \n\ntransferred to respiration bottles to which 200 \u00b5 L of 5 N HCl were added to drive out \n\nthe 14CO2. A strip of filter paper saturated with 200 \u00b5 L of ethanolamine was suspended \n\nabove the sample in the respiration bottle and used to absorb the emitted 14CO2 over a \n\nperiod of 24 h. The efficiency of 14C recovery was determined from a similar volume of \n\nwater treated with [14C]bicarbonate. Nitrocellulose filters and paper filters from \n\nincorporation and respiration experiments, respectively, were then transferred to mini-\n\nvials to which a volume of 1.5 mL of Universol liquid scintillation cocktail (ICN \n\nBiomedicals, USA) was added. The radioactivity incorporated into bacterial cells was \n\ncounted in a Beckman LS 6000 IC liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments, \n\nInc., Fullerton, CA) (Gocke, 1977). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n118 \n\nIntracellular ROS production \n\nIntracellular ROS production was detected using the probe 2',7'-\n\ndichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA, Cayman Chemical Co. Ltd., MI, \n\nUSA) (P\u00e9rez et al., 2007). Control and irradiated cell suspensions were centrifuged and \n\nwashed with 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), amended with the probe \n\ndiluted in the same buffer (final concentration 10 \u00b5 M), and incubated for 30 min in the \n\ndark. Cells were subsequently washed, sonicated and 100 \u00b5 L of the cell extracts were \n\nmixed with 1 mL of the potassium phosphate buffer. The fluorescence of the samples \n\nwas measured with a Jasco FP-777 Fluorometer (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd., Tokyo, \n\nJapan) at room temperature, with an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and emission \n\nwavelength of 519 nm. The fluorescence intensity at 519 nm was corrected against \n\nblank controls (cell-free suspensions) and then normalized to protein content (see below \n\nfor procedure) and compared with the values obtained before irradiation. Unless \n\notherwise specified, all reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO). \n\nResults were expressed per mg of protein. \n\n \n\nDNA strand breakage \n\nUV-induced DNA damage was assessed by the quantification of DNA strand \n\nbreaks (DSB) using a modified version of the FADU (Fluorimetric Analysis of DNA \n\nUnwinding) method, as described by He and H\u00e4der (2002). In addition to the test \n\nsamples (so-called P-samples), the method requires two sets of untreated control \n\nsamples: samples not subjected to alkaline unwinding (T-samples) and samples \n\nsubjected to complete alkaline unwinding (B-samples). Cells were collected by \n\ncentrifugation (3,000 g, 15 min) and digested with lysozyme (4 mg mL-1 final \n\nconcentration) in EDTA solution, followed by proteinase K (0.25 mg mL-1 final \n\nconcentration). A volume of 300 \u00b5L of 0.1 M NaOH was added to the three sets of \n\nsamples: (1) T-samples were neutralized with 300 \u00b5L of 0.1 M HCl and sonicated for 15 \n\ns, following a 30 min incubation at room temperature; (2) B-samples were sonicated for \n\n2 min, neutralized with 300 \u00b5L of 0.1 M HCl after a 30 min incubation and sonicated \n\nagain for 15 s; and (3) P-samples were incubated for 30 min, neutralized with 300 \u00b5L of \n\n0.1 M HCl and sonicated for 15 s. \n\nA final concentration of 5 \u00b5 M of Hoechst 33258 was added to all samples and \n\nafter centrifugation, a 1 mL volume of supernatant was used for the fluorescence \n\nmeasurements (?ex. 350 nm; ?em. 450 nm) in a Jasco FP-777 Fluorometer (Japan \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n119 \n\nSpectroscopic Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The fraction of double stranded DNA (dsDNA) \n\nwas calculated as dsDNA = (P?B)/(T?B)\u00d7100, where T, P and B were fluorescence \n\nintensities of T-, P- and B-samples normalized to the protein content, respectively (He \n\nand H\u00e4der, 2002). All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO). \n\n \n\nLipid peroxidation \n\nLipid peroxidation was determined as the amount of thiobarbituric acid reactive \n\nsubstances (TBARS) as described by P\u00e9rez et al. (2007). Control and irradiated cells \n\nwere centrifuged, washed, and suspended in 1 mL of 50 mM potassium phosphate \n\nbuffer (pH 7.4) added of 0.1 mM butylated hydroxytoluene and 1 mM PMSF \n\n(phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). After sonication and centrifugation in order to \n\nremove cellular debris, the soluble fraction was mixed with 1 mL of 20 % \n\ntrichloroacetic acid and centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 5 min. The supernatant was \n\ntransferred to a new microtube and mixed with 1 mL of 0.5 % (w/v) thiobarbituric acid \n\nin 0.1 M HCl and 10 mM butylated hydroxytoluene. Samples were heated at 100 \u00baC for \n\n1 h, after which 1 mL aliquots were removed, cooled and then mixed with 1.5 mL of \n\nbutanol. After centrifugation (4,000 x g, 10 min), the organic fraction was removed and \n\nthe absorbance at 535 nm was read in a Thermo Spectronic Genesys 10 UV \n\nspectrophotometer. TBARS content was determined by the extinction coefficient of 156 \n\nmM-1cm-1. All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO). Results \n\nwere expressed per mg of protein. \n\n \n\nProtein oxidation  \n\nThe carbonyl content in oxidized proteins was determined according to \n\nSemchyshyn et al. (2005). Aliquots of homogenates were incubated for 1 h at room \n\ntemperature with 10 mM dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) in 2 M HCl. DNPH was \n\nomitted in the blanks. Proteins were precipitated with 500 \u00b5 L of 20 % trichloroacetic \n\nacid, centrifuged (14,000 x g, 5 min) and the pellet was washed three times with 1 mL \n\nof 1:1 (vol/vol) ethanol-ethyl acetate. The final precipitate was dissolved in 1 mL of 6 \n\nM guanidine hydrochloride. Samples were spectrophotometrically analyzed against a \n\nblank of 1 mL of guanidine solution (6 M guanidine hydrochloride with 2 mM \n\npotassium phosphate). The absorbance at 360 nm was determined and the molar \n\nabsorption coefficient of 22 mM-1cm-1 was used to quantify the levels of protein \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n120 \n\ncarbonyls. All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO). Results \n\nwere expressed per mg of protein. \n\n \n\nProtein concentration \n\nProtein concentration in cell homogenates was determined by the Bradford \n\nmethod using BSA as a standard (Bradford, 1976). \n\n \n\nStatistical analysis \n\nAll experiments were repeated in three independent assays and biochemical and \n\nmicrobiological analysis were always conducted in triplicate. Differences between the \n\ntreatments with and without scavengers were assessed by 1-way ANOVA using the \n\nstatistical software SPSS v.17. Levene test was used to assess homogeneity of \n\nvariances. If variances were not homogeneous, the natural logarithm transformation was \n\napplied. If variances were still not homogenous, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test \n\nwas used to assess the overall effect of treatment (Sokal and Rolf, 1995). \n\n \n\nResults \n\nSodium azide significantly attenuated the reduction in colony counts upon \n\nirradiation in all strains tested (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05), from 16.2 % to 45.8 %. Pre-\n\ntreatment of bacterial cell suspensions with CAT, SOD, or mannitol did not \n\nsignificantly affect survival during UVB exposure in any of the strains tested (Fig. 7.1 \n\nA). Sodium azide was also the only scavenger to mitigate the UVB reduction in total \n\nbacterial number, by up to 32.2 %, in all of the strains tested (Fig. 7.1 B). \n\n \n\nFig. 7.1.

Oxidative damage induced by increased ROS \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n124 \n\ngeneration is an important outcome of the exposure of bacteria to UVB radiation and \n\ncan actually be a more prominent threat to microorganisms than direct DNA damage \n\n(Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1999). Yet, information on the role of UVB-induced ROS in \n\nbiological and biochemical damage to bacteria is rather scarce and mostly obtained \n\nindirectly from transcriptomic and proteomic studies reporting the induction of \n\nantioxidant defences upon exposure of bacteria to UVB radiation (Qiu et al., 2005a; \n\nMatallana-Surget et al., 2009a). \n\nIn the present work, the involvement and targets of ROS in UVB-induced \n\ndamage was investigated in a direct experimental approach using specific scavengers \n\nfor different ROS (hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen and superoxide \n\nradical) and assessing the effects on biological and biochemical parameters. A set of \n\nisolates with distinct UV sensitivities, isolated after irradiation of estuarine surface \n\nwater samples, were used as tentative representatives of the culturable fraction of a UV-\n\nstressed community. Therefore, their responses can provide insights into the \n\nmechanisms by which global changes, such as changes in UVB levels, are affecting the \n\nfunctions of bacterial mixed communities and may impact biogeochemical cycles. \n\nThe effects of ROS scavengers on biological and biochemical parameters were \n\nvariable among the different isolates tested. In the present work, two Gram-positive \n\n(Micrococcus sp. and Staphylococcus sp.) and two Gram-negative (Paracoccus sp. and \n\nPseudomonas sp.) phylogenetically distinct bacterial isolates were used. Due to their \n\ncell wall characteristics, Gram-positive bacteria have been proposed to be more resistant \n\nto UV radiation than Gram-negative strains (Jagger, 1985). However, significant \n\nfundamental differences in neither UVB sensitivity, nor in the responses to amendment \n\nwith different scavengers, between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were \n\nobserved, in accordance with previous works (Agogu\u00e9 et al., 2005). \n\n \n\nSinglet oxygen  \n\nSodium azide exerted a significant protective effect on culturable and total \n\nbacterial abundance (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05) during UVB exposure. Singlet oxygen \n\nalso protected against lipid peroxidation (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05) during irradiation. \n\nThese results suggest that singlet oxygen (1O2) is an important mediator of UVB-\n\ninduced cell inactivation, in which lipid oxidation probably plays an important role. \n\nPrevious studies had already demonstrated the ability of 1O2 to react with the double \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n125 \n\nbond of unsaturated fatty acids leading to the formation of lipid hydroperoxides (Vile \n\nand Tyrrell, 1995). \n\n \n\nHydroxyl radical \n\nThe observation that mannitol was the only scavenger that significantly reduced \n\nthe amount of DSB during UVB exposure confirms the involvement of hydroxyl radical \n\n(\u2022OH) in DNA damage, in accordance with previous observations (Peak and Peak, \n\n1990). Mannitol was also able to significantly attenuate protein carbonylation during \n\nUVB exposure, suggesting the importance of the hydroxyl radical in protein oxidative \n\ndamage during UVB exposure.  \n\nIn the cell, the hydroxyl radical can be formed via the Fenton reaction in which \n\nthe divalent metal ions Fe2+ or Cu+ catalyze the degradation of hydrogen peroxide (Bast \n\net al., 1991; Koppenol, 2001), according to the reaction: \n\nH2O2 + Fe\n2+ ? OH- + Fe3+ + \u2022OH \n\nTo a lesser extent, the hydroxyl radical can also be formed via the Haber-Weiss \n\nreaction in which superoxide reduces Fe2+ or Cu+, which can subsequently combine \n\nwith hydrogen peroxide to form the hydroxyl radical (Kehrer, 2000)  \n\nO2\n?? + H2O2 ? \n\n\u2022OH + OH- + O2 \n\nAdditionally, the hydroxyl radical can also be formed by metal-independent \n\nprocesses, as a result of the decomposition of peroxynitrite, an oxidant formed by \n\ncombination between nitric oxide and the superoxide radical (Hogg et al., 1992). \n\nThe extremely short half-life of the hydroxyl radical limits its reactivity to the \n\nimmediate vicinity from where it is formed. Therefore, Fe-S clusters of proteins and \n\nenzymes using iron as prosthetic metal are major targets of oxidative damage by the \n\nhydroxyl radical (Imlay, 2006). Iron bound to DNA can also catalyze the formation of \n\nthe hydroxyl radical which then attacks DNA bases or the deoxyribosyl backbone of \n\nDNA to produce damaged bases or strand breaks (Imlay et al., 1988). \n\n \n\nSuperoxide and hydrogen peroxide \n\nGlucose incorporation and respiration were effectively protected from UVB by \n\namendment with exogenous CAT and SOD, suggesting that superoxide and/or hydrogen \n\nperoxide are involved in the impairment of bacterial activity. Glucose incorporation was \n\nalso protected by amendment with mannitol, suggesting a role of the hydroxyl radical in \n\nthe impairment of membrane processes. The auto-oxidation of flavoenzymes is \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n126 \n\nprobably the predominant endogenous source of both O2\n\u2022- and H2O2 (Imlay, 2003), but \n\nthe activity of SOD itself is also an important source of H2O2 (Buettner et al., 2006). \n\nDetrimental effects of H2O2 could be related to its ability to directly oxidize and thus \n\nalter the activity of proteins containing deprotonated cysteine residues (Pattison and \n\nDavies, 2006). Superoxide oxidizes and inactivates proteins containing Fe-S clusters, \n\nsuch as respiratory chain proteins of the membrane, releasing Fe2+ ions and hydrogen \n\nperoxide that can further produce the highly toxic hydroxyl radical by the Fenton \n\nreaction. The resulting hydroxyl radical is very reactive and therefore preferentially \n\naffects the neighbourhood in which it is generated, compromising membrane integrity \n\nand the function of membrane transport proteins (Girotti and Giacomoni, 2007).  \n\n \n\nRole of antioxidant defences in UVB-induced damage \n\nThe antioxidant status is an important determinant of the magnitude of UVB-\n\ninduced oxidative injuries, with SOD and CAT usually considered as the first line of \n\ndefence of cells against ROS (Apel and Hirt, 2004). However, in some cases \n\namendment with ROS scavengers exacerbated the detrimental effect of UVB radiation \n\non biological parameters. Such effect was not attributed to toxicity of the scavenger, \n\nsince significant differences between dark controls without scavenger and dark controls \n\namended with every scavenger tested were not found for any of the biological and \n\nbiochemical parameters tested (1-way ANOVA, p > 0.05). In particular, a statistically \n\nsignificant increase in the amount of DSB was observed in SOD- and CAT-amended \n\nsamples, suggesting that the activity of these enzymes can contribute to oxidative \n\ndamage to biomolecules during exposure to UVB. It is well established that CAT is \n\ninvolved in the degradation of hydrogen peroxide and a potentially protective role of \n\nCAT in UV resistance among Acinetobacter sp. isolates was recently proposed (Di \n\nCapua et al., 2011). However, when intracellular antioxidant moieties are limited, CAT \n\nactivity can generate ROS during UVB exposure (Heck et al., 2003; Heck et al., 2010). \n\nSOD can also increase the oxidative burden of the cell since hydrogen peroxide \n\ngenerated from its activity is a more oxidant species than superoxide (Scott et al., 1989). \n\nUltimately, depending of the intracellular oxidation status, the activity of these \n\nantioxidant enzymes in response to UVB light can be either protective or cytotoxic.  \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n127 \n\nConclusions \n\nThe present work identifies an important role of singlet oxygen in UVB-induced \n\ncell inactivation, potentially by mediating oxidative damage to lipids, as suggested by \n\nattenuation of the reduction in cell abundance (culturable and total) and TBARS levels \n\nin sodium azide-amended samples. DNA strand breakage and protein carbonylation \n\nduring UVB exposure were attenuated in samples amended with mannitol, suggesting \n\nthe involvement of the hydroxyl radical in DNA and protein damage. Superoxide and \n\nhydrogen peroxide could play important roles in impairment of membrane transport and \n\nrespiration during UVB exposure.  \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nAcknowledgments are due to the two anonymous reviewers whose insightful comments and suggestions \n\ncontributed to improve the original manuscript.

L., Gomes N. C. M., Henriques I., Almeida A., Correia A., Cunha A. \n\nPhotochemistry and Photobiology (accepted) \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nThe purpose of this study was to explore the possible link between metals and \n\nUVB-induced damage in bacteria. The effect of growth in the presence of enhanced \n\nconcentrations of different transition metals (Co, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn) on UVB \n\nsensitivity of a set of bacterial isolates was explored in terms of survival, activity and \n\noxidative stress biomarkers (ROS generation, damage to DNA, lipid and proteins, and \n\nactivity of antioxidant enzymes). Metal amendment, particularly Fe, Cu and Mn, \n\nenhanced bacterial inactivation during irradiation by up to 35.8 %. Amendment with Fe \n\nincreased ROS generation during irradiation by 1.2 %-13.3 %, DNA damage by 10.8 %-\n\n37.4 % and lipid oxidative damage by 9.6 %-68.7 %. Lipid damage during irradiation \n\nalso increased after incubation with Cu and Co by up to 66.8 % and 56.5 %, \n\nrespectively. Mn amendment decreased protein carbonylation during irradiation by up \n\nto 44.2 %. These results reveal a role of Fe, Co, Cu and Mn in UVB-induced bacterial \n\ninactivation and the importance of metal homeostasis to limit the detrimental effects of \n\nROS generated during irradiation.  \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\nUVB radiation (280-320 nm) is the most detrimental wavelength of the solar \n\nradiation spectrum. The severest biological consequence of UVB radiation has been \n\ntraditionally considered to be DNA damage, most notably the formation of DNA \n\nphotoproducts (H\u00e4der and Sinha, 2005). However, UVB induced cell damage can also \n\narise as the result of increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during \n\nirradiation and subsequent oxidative damage to biomolecules (Halliwell and Gutteridge, \n\n1999). Studies reporting the induction of antioxidant defences during UVB exposure of \n\nbacteria support the hypothesis of the contribution of oxidative stress to UVB-induced \n\ndamage (Qiu et al., 2005a; Matallana-Surget et al., 2009a). The cellular and biological \n\nconsequences of ROS are strongly influenced by metal ion homeostasis (Halliwell and \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n130 \n\nGutteridge, 1999). Metal ions, most notably iron (Fe2+) and copper (Cu+), play a \n\ncatalytic role in the generation of ROS through participation in Fenton and Haber-Weiss \n\nreactions that generate toxic hydroxyl radicals that can damage biomolecules and cause \n\ncell death (Wardman and Candeias, 1996). Since many of the respiratory chain proteins \n\nuse iron as a cofactor, they are among the first targets of oxidative damage through the \n\nFenton reaction (Choksi et al., 2008). The hydroxyl radicals generated in the process \n\ncan in turn attack membrane lipids and other membrane proteins (Bourdon and Blache, \n\n2001; Niki et al., 2005). On the other hand, cobalt (Co2+) can compete directly with \n\niron, thereby affecting the synthesis of Fe-S clusters (Ranquet et al., 2007; Thorgersen \n\nand Downs, 2007), leading to decreased iron bioavailability and eventually oxidative \n\nstress (Fantino et al., 2010).  \n\nRecently, a possible protective role of transition metal ions against ionizing \n\nradiation has been discussed. A high capacity for intracellular copper ion sequestration \n\nwas detected in Kineococcus radiotolerans (Domain Bacteria, Phylum Actinobacteria) \n\nthat provided protection against the damaging effects of ionizing radiation (Bagwell et \n\nal., 2008). Manganese (Mn2+) ions also seem to play a role in the prevention of \n\noxidative damage during exposure to different types of stress including UVC radiation, \n\ngamma-irradiation, wet and dry heat and H2O2 (Daly et al., 2007; Barnese et al., 2008; \n\nMcEwan, 2009; Daly et al., 2010; McNaughton et al., 2010; Slade and Radman, 2011). \n\nZinc (Zn2+) uptake is also a key component of the adaptive response to peroxide stress \n\n(Gaballa and Helmann, 2002), protecting copper-treated Escherichia coli against \n\nsuperoxide killing (Korbashi et al., 1989) and countering the effects of oxidative stress \n\nin Lactococcus lactis (Scott et al., 2000). \n\nIncreased levels of proteins involved in iron homeostasis, induction of iron-\n\nsequestering protein-encoding genes and repression of genes involved in iron uptake \n\nhave been observed in bacteria irradiated with UVB (Qiu et al., 2005a; Matallana-\n\nSurget et al., 2009a), suggesting the importance of regulation of the intracellular iron \n\nion pool following UVB exposure. However, whether certain transition metal ions play \n\na physiological role in bacterial resistance to environmentally relevant UV radiation, \n\nmost notably UVB radiation, remains uncertain. This information is critical to \n\nunderstanding the effects of UV radiation on the ecological context of natural \n\ncommunities, where these metals can be particularly enriched when industries and \n\nagriculture facilities are located nearby (Zhou et al., 2008). Furthermore, understanding \n\nthe role that metals play during UV-induced bacterial inactivation can help develop \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n131 \n\nmore efficient photocatalytic disinfection strategies (Sciacca et al., 2010). Accordingly, \n\nthe objectives of this study were to investigate the potential synergistic effects of \n\ntransition metals and exposure to UVB radiation in bacterial cells and evaluate their \n\npotential protective role against structural and functional cellular damage elicited during \n\nUVB exposure in a set of bacterial isolates. \n\n \n\nMaterials and methods \n\nCulture conditions and experimental layout \n\nThe bacterial strains used in the present study were previously isolated from the \n\nsurface waters of an estuarine system. The isolates are affiliated to different \n\nphylogenetic groups: Alphaproteobacteria (Paracoccus sp.), Gammaproteobacteria \n\n(Pseudomonas sp.), Bacilli (Staphylococcus sp.) and Actinobacteria (Micrococcus sp.) \n\nand display different UVB sensitivities (Santos et al., 2011), which are presented in \n\nTable 8.1 as LD50 values (UVB dose necessary for the inactivation of 50 % of bacteria).  \n\nStock solutions (10 mM) of various transition metals (Co, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn) \n\nwere prepared in deionized, filter-sterilized water from the corresponding metallic salts: \n\nferrous ammonium sulfate, manganese chloride, zinc sulfate, cupric sulfate and cobalt \n\nsulfate. In order to select the metal concentration that affected the least the growth curve \n\nof the different bacterial strains, and that was subsequently used for UV exposure \n\nassays, preliminary experiments were conducted with different metal concentrations (1 \n\n\u00b5 M, 10 \u00b5 M, 100 \u00b5 M) in TGY medium (1.0 % tryptone, 0.1 % glucose, 0.5 % yeast \n\nextract) (Bagwell et al., 2008). Growth curves obtained in these conditions were \n\ncompared with those obtained in the absence of added metals. Cultures were incubated \n\nfor up to 72 h at 25 \u00baC with agitation (120 rpm). At pre-determined intervals, triplicate \n\naliquots were collected and the optical density (OD) at 600 nm was determined.  \n\n \n\nTable 8.1.

Liquid cultures of each isolate were grown to mid-\n\nexponential phase (OD600 of 0.2-0.3) in TGY or TGY amended with 1 \u00b5 M of Co, Cu, \n\nFe, Mn or Zn. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (3,200 x g for 15 min, Eppendorf \n\nCentrifuge 5415R, Hamburg, Germany) and the pellet was washed three times with 50 \n\nmM EDTA/ 10 mM Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS; pH 7.5) to remove cell surface-\n\nadsorbed transition metals (Bagwell et al., 2008). Cells were then resuspended in 10 \n\nmM PBS for determination of bacterial abundance by epifluorescence microscopy \n\n(Hobbie et al., 1977), and adjusted to 106 cells mL-1 with 10 mM PBS. A convenient \n\nvolume of cell suspension was transferred to sterile 150 x 25 mm plastic tissue culture \n\ndishes (Corning Science Products, Corning, NY, USA) so that the depth of the liquid \n\nwas &lt;2 mm. The lid was removed from the culture during UVB irradiation (Philips TL \n\n100 W/01 lamps, main emission wavelength line of 302 nm). Metal-amended and \n\nunamended dark controls (covered in aluminum foil) treated in the same way as the \n\nirradiated samples were included in every experiment. Inactivation curves of bacterial \n\nstrains under the different metal-amended and unamended regimes were determined by \n\nirradiating bacterial suspensions under UVB for a total light dose of 60 kJ m-2 and \n\ncollecting aliquots at pre-determined light doses for CFU determination, as described \n\nbelow. UV intensities were measured with a monochromator spectro-radiometer placed \n\nat the sample level (DM 300, Bentham Instruments, Reading, UK). Inactivation curves \n\nwere used to determine the LD50 in metal-amended and unamended conditions. \n\nAdditionally, aliquots of cell suspensions were collected before and after irradiation at \n\nthe LD50 of unamended samples (50.1 kJ m\n-2 for Micrococcus sp., 40.3 kJ m-2 for \n\nParacoccus sp., 49.3 kJ m-2 for Pseudomonas sp. and 37.0 kJ m-2 for Staphylococcus \n\nsp.) (Table 8.1) for biological and biochemical analysis. For protein carbonyls and \n\nantioxidant activity (catalase/CAT and superoxide dismutase/SOD) determinations, \n\ncells were immediately resuspended in cold 50 mM PBS (pH 7.8) containing 1 mM \n\nEDTA and sonicated in ice (Branson Instruments Co. Sonifier, Stamford, Conn.; 2 min, \n\n30-s pulses, 1 min cooling). The extracts were centrifuged (10,000 x g, 15 min) and the \n\nsupernatant frozen at -80 \u00b0C until analysis. All experiments were repeated in three \n\nindependent assays. Parameters were always determined in a minimum of three \n\nanalytical replicates. Positive (50 mM H2O2-treated) and negative (untreated) controls \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n133 \n\nwere always included and processed along experimental samples in order to ensure \n\nproper functioning of the procedures on all strains. \n\n \n\nColony forming units (CFU) \n\nBefore and after irradiation, sample aliquots were serially-diluted in 1 x PBS and \n\nspread-plated in triplicate in agar plates (Difco, Detroit, MI). Colonies were counted \n\nafter up to 7 days of incubation in the dark, at 25 \u00baC. The dilution and plating \n\nprocedures were carried out under low-luminosity conditions to minimize \n\nphotoreactivation.  \n\n \n\nGlucose uptake \n\nThe effects of UV radiation combined with the exposure to metals on bacterial \n\nenergy metabolism were assessed from glucose uptake activity, using a protocol adapted \n\nfrom Harada et al. (2010). Triplicate 1.5 mL aliquots of bacterial suspension and a 5 % \n\n(wt/vol) trichloroacetic acid-fixed control were incubated with [14C]glucose (Amersham \n\nBiosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK; SA 310 mCi mmol-1) at a saturating concentration \n\nof 150 \u00b5 M. Samples were incubated in the dark at in situ temperatures for 1 h. \n\nIncubations were stopped by the addition of chilled 5 % (wt/vol) trichloroacetic acid \n\n(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and samples were filtered through nitrocellulose filters \n\n(0.2-\u00b5m-pore-size; Millipore, Tokyo, Japan). Filters were then rinsed three times with \n\nchilled 5 % trichloroacetic acid and transferred to eppendorfs. A volume of 1.5 mL of \n\nUniversol liquid scintillation cocktail (ICN Biomedicals, USA) was added. The amount \n\nof radioactivity incorporated into bacterial cells was determined in a Beckman LS 6000 \n\nIC liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA). \n\n \n\nIn vivo production of ROS  \n\nIn vivo production of ROS was detected using the probe 2',7'-\n\ndichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA, Cayman Chemical Co. Ltd., MI, \n\nUSA) (P\u00e9rez et al., 2007). Control and irradiated samples were centrifuged and washed \n\nwith 10 mM PBS (pH 7.0). After amendment with the probe (final concentration 10 \n\n\u00b5 M), the mixture was incubated in the dark for 30 min. Afterwards, cells were washed, \n\nsonicated and the cell extracts were mixed with potassium phosphate buffer. The \n\nfluorescence of the samples was measured with a Jasco FP-777 Fluorometer (Japan \n\nSpectroscopic Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at room temperature (?ex. 490 nm; ?em. 519 nm). \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n134 \n\nThe fluorescence intensity at 519 nm was corrected against the blank control (without \n\ncells) and then normalized to the biomass, determined as the amount of cellular protein \n\naccording to the method of Bradford (Bradford, 1972). Unless otherwise specified, all \n\nreagents used for this and subsequent protocols were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St \n\nLouis, MO).  \n\n \n\nDNA strand breakage \n\nUV-induced DNA damage was assessed using the quantification of DNA strand \n\nbreaks (DSB) as a proxy, following a previously described procedure (He and H\u00e4der, \n\n2002). The method requires three sets of samples: test samples (so-called P-samples), \n\nsamples not subjected to alkaline unwinding (T-samples) and samples subjected to \n\ncomplete alkaline unwinding (B-samples). Cells were collected by centrifugation (3,000 \n\nx g, 15 min) and digested with lysozyme (4 mg mL-1 final concentration) and proteinase \n\nK (0.25 mg mL-1 final concentration). A volume of 300 \u00b5L of 0.1 M NaOH was added \n\nto the three sets of samples: (1) T-samples were immediately neutralized with 300 \u00b5L of \n\n0.1 M HCl, incubated at room temperature for 30 min and sonicated for 15 s; (2) B-\n\nsamples were sonicated for 2 min, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, \n\nneutralized with 300 \u00b5 L of 0.1 M HCl and sonicated again for 15 s; and (3) P-samples \n\nwere incubated for 30 min, neutralized with 300 \u00b5 L of 0.1 M HCl and sonicated for 15 \n\ns. \n\nA final concentration of 5 \u00b5 M of Hoechst 33258 was added to all samples. After \n\ncentrifugation, the supernatant was used for fluorescence measurements (?ex. 350 nm; \n\n?em. 450 nm) in a Jasco FP-777 Fluorometer (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd., Tokyo, \n\nJapan). The fraction of double stranded DNA (dsDNA) was calculated as dsDNA = \n\n(P?B)/(T?B)\u00d7100, where T, P and B were fluorescence intensities of T-, P- and B-\n\nsamples normalized to the biomass, respectively.  \n\n \n\nLipid peroxidation \n\nLipid peroxidation was determined as the amount of thiobarbituric acid reactive \n\nsubstances (TBARS) as previously described (P\u00e9rez et al., 2007). Control and irradiated \n\ncells were centrifuged, washed, and suspended in 50 mM PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 \n\nmM butylated hydroxytoluene and 1 mM of the protease inhibitor PMSF \n\n(phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). Afterwards, cell suspensions were sonicated and \n\ncentrifuged, and the soluble fraction was mixed with an equal volume of 20 % \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n135 \n\ntrichloroacetic acid. Following another centrifugation step at 10,000 x g for 5 min, \n\nsupernatants were removed and mixed with 1 volume of 0.5 % (w/v) thiobarbituric acid \n\nin 0.1 M HCl and 10 mM butylated hydroxytoluene. After incubation at 100 \u00baC for 1 h, \n\naliquots were removed, cooled and mixed with 1.5 volumes of butanol. The mixture was \n\ncentrifuged (4,000 x g, 10 min) and the organic fraction was removed. The absorbance \n\nat 535 nm was read using a Thermo Spectronic Genesys 10 UV spectrophotometer and \n\nTBARS content was determined using an extinction coefficient of 156 mM-1cm-1. \n\nResults were normalized to the cell biomass. \n\n \n\nProtein oxidation \n\nThe carbonyl content in oxidized proteins was determined as previously reported \n\n(Semchyshyn et al., 2005). Aliquots of sonicated cells were incubated with 10 mM \n\ndinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) in 2 M HCl for 1 hour at room temperature. In blanks, \n\nDNPH was omitted. In order to precipitate proteins, 20 % trichloroacetic acid was \n\nadded, after which suspensions were centrifuged (14,000 x g, 5 min), and the pellet \n\nwashed three times with 1:1 (vol/vol) ethanol-ethyl acetate. The final precipitate was \n\ndissolved in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. The absorbance at 360 nm was determined \n\nagainst a blank of guanidine solution (6 M guanidine hydrochloride with 2 mM \n\npotassium phosphate), and a molar absorption coefficient of 22 mM-1 cm-1 was used to \n\nquantify the levels of protein carbonyls. Results were normalized to the biomass. \n\n \n\nAntioxidant enzymatic activity \n\nCatalase (CAT) activity was measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the \n\nrate of decomposition of H2O2 (Beers and Sizer, 1952). One unit of CAT activity was \n\ndefined as the amount of activity required to decompose 1 \u00b5 mol of H2O2 per minute \n\nunder the assay conditions. The strain Enterococcus faecalis was used as a negative \n\ncontrol. A mixture of 18 mM hydrogen peroxide and sterile potassium phosphate buffer \n\n(1:5) was used as an additional negative control (Anderl et al., 2003). Superoxide \n\ndismutase (SOD) activity was determined according to McCord and Fridovich (McCord \n\nand Fridovich, 1969), in which a xanthine-xanthine oxidase system is used to generate \n\nsuperoxide and nitroblue tetrazolium is used as an indicator. One unit of SOD activity \n\nwas defined as the amount of SOD that resulted in 50 % inhibition of the reduction of \n\nnitroblue tetrazolium. Potassium phosphate buffer was used as a blank. Results were \n\nnormalized to the biomass. \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n136 \n\nBacterial biomass \n\nBacterial biomass was determined from the protein concentration in cell \n\nhomogenates according to the Bradford method, using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as \n\na standard (Bradford, 1976). \n\n \n\nStatistical analysis \n\nAll experiments were repeated in three independent assays and biochemical and \n\nmicrobiological analysis were always conducted in triplicate. Differences between \n\ntreatments were assessed by 1-way ANOVA using the statistical software SPSS v.17. \n\nLevene test was used to assess homogeneity of variances. If variances were not \n\nhomogeneous, the natural logarithm transformation was applied. If variances were still \n\nnot homogenous, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was used to assess the overall \n\neffect of treatment. Stepwise multiple regression, used to identify groups of independent \n\nvariables (ROS, DSB, TBARS and carbonyls levels, as well as SOD and CAT activity) \n\nwith the most significant contribution to the variability of the dependent variable \n\n(bacterial inactivation expressed as LD50), was conducted with SPSS v. 17. \n\n \n\nResults \n\nEffects of UV-Irradiation on Biological and Biochemical Parameters \n\nTo select metal concentrations that would not significantly affect neither the \n\ngrowth curve of bacterial isolates nor the level of oxidative stress markers on \n\nunirradiated cells, thereby minimizing any potential toxic effect of the metals during \n\nirradiation experiments, different metal concentrations were tested. A concentration of 1 \n\n\u00b5 M affected the least the growth curve and did not significantly alter the levels of \n\noxidative stress markers of cells (Table 8.2) and was therefore chosen for subsequent \n\nUV-assays. \n\nUVB inactivation curves of bacterial isolates grown with and without added \n\nconcentrations of metals are represented in Fig. 8.1. Dark controls for every metal \n\ntreatment were also performed but not included in the figure for simplicity, since \n\nsignificant differences between dark controls of unamended and metal-amended \n\nsamples were not observed (1-way ANOVA, p > 0.05).  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n137 \n\n  \n\n  \nFig. 8.1.

L.C. \u2013 light control (without metal). \n\n \n\nCompared to unamended samples, metal amendment generally reduced the LD50 \n\nby up to 21.4 kJ m-2. This effect was particularly significant for the Cu, Fe and Mn \n\ntreatments and variable depending on the bacterial isolate (Table 8.1). The effects of \n\ndifferent transition metals on survival and activity during UVB exposure are represented \n\nin Fig. 8.2. Amendment with Cu, Fe and Mn significantly (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05) \n\ndecreased survival following exposure to UVB by 10.8 %-27.7 %, 16.5 %-35.8 % and \n\n13.1 %-31.0 %, respectively, in all isolates tested (Fig. 8.2 A). Depending on the strain, \n\nthe effects of metal treatment were not significant, protective or detrimental to glucose \n\nincorporation during irradiation (Fig. 8.2 B).  \n\nTreatment with Co and Zn resulted in either an increase or attenuation of ROS \n\ngeneration, depending on the strains. Cu and Fe treatments were responsible for a net \n\nincrease in ROS generation during UVB exposure by up to 9.8 and 13.3 %, respectively. \n\nAmendment with Mn significantly attenuated ROS generation during irradiation (up to \n\n20.5 %; 1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05) in all strains (Fig. 8.3 A). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n138 \n\nTable 8.2.

However, the role of transition metals on the \n\nsusceptibility of bacteria to environmentally relevant UV radiation remains unknown. \n\nThis lack of information impairs the realistic understanding of UV effects in bacterial \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n142 \n\ncommunities in natural environments where metals are frequently present, seasonally \n\nvariable and can represent additional stress factors (Zhou et al., 2008).  \n\nIn the present work, the effect of five transition metals on the UV sensitivity and \n\nUV-induced cellular damage on a set of bacterial isolates was studied. The \n\nconcentrations of metals used were generally in agreement with reported environmental \n\nconcentrations in aquatic systems, particularly in the runoff of urban areas (Mudhoo et \n\nal., 2012). The importance of metals to UVB-induced damage was evident from the \n\nshift in the descriptors that contributed the most to explain bacterial inactivation \n\n(expressed as LD50) following treatment with different metals, as revealed by linear \n\nregression. \n\n \n\nRole of Co, Cu and Fe \n\nDespite the observed variability in the effects of UV-induced damage in the \n\ndifferent strains tested, amendment with metals generally decreased the dose necessary \n\nfor inactivation by UVB (LD50), thereby suggesting a synergistic effect of metals and \n\nUVB radiation in bacterial cell damage.  \n\nThe Fenton reactive metals Fe and Cu had a significant detrimental effect on \n\nbacterial survival during irradiation, potentially associated to enhanced ROS and \n\nTBARS generation following irradiation in metal-treated bacterial suspensions. In the \n\ncase of Fe, an increase in DNA damage compared to untreated controls was also \n\nobserved, and together with ROS generation and TBARS, accounted for 99.3 % of the \n\nvariation in LD50, as shown by linear regression. Such effects are in line with the role of \n\nthe divalent Fe ion (Fe2+) in promoting the generation of the powerful oxidant hydroxyl \n\nradical according to the following reaction:  \n\nFe2+ + H2O2 ? Fe\n3+ + OH- + OH? \n\nThe hydroxyl radical can in turn cause damage to any biomolecule. The current \n\nstudy confirms the involvement of Fe in UVB-induced oxidative damage and the \n\nimportance of Fe homeostasis through the regulation of genes involved in Fe influx, \n\nstorage and expression of Fe-containing enzymes (Qiu et al., 2005a; Matallana-Surget et \n\nal., 2009a) in limiting the detrimental effects of exposure to UVB.  \n\nUnder aerobic conditions, Cu (similarly to Fe) can participate in Haber-Weiss \n\nreactions to mediate the generation of the hydroxyl radical (Santo et al., 2011). In \n\naccordance to what was observed with Fe, treatment with Cu increased TBARS and \n\nROS generation. However, as opposed to Fe, it did not significantly increase DNA \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n143 \n\ndamage during irradiation. This observation can be explained, at least in Gram-negative \n\nbacteria, by the compartmentalization of hydroxyl radicals generated by Cu in the \n\nperiplasm of the cell, which limited its damage to the membrane and cell wall \n\n(Macomber et al., 2007), thus accounting for the observed increase in TBARS in Cu-\n\namended samples.  \n\nIrradiation of cell suspensions after treatment with Co also caused a significant \n\nincrease in TBARS levels which, in Gram-negative bacteria, can be attributed to the \n\nability of Co to react with H2O2 generated inside the cell by a Fenton-type reaction \n\nwithin the periplasmic space (Barras and Fontecave, 2011). The resulting hydroxyl \n\nradicals are able to subsequently attack membrane and cell wall components \n\n(Moorhouse et al., 1985; Barras and Fontecave, 2011).  \n\nTogether, these results suggest that the toxicity of ROS generated during UV \n\nexposure is mediated by intracellular metals, particularly by the more biologically \n\nrelevant Fe and Cu, whose homeostasis plays a crucial role in limiting the detrimental \n\neffects of oxidative damage during UVB irradiation. \n\n \n\nRole of Mn \n\nMn was the only metal that reduced protein carbonyl levels during UV exposure \n\nin all strains tested. High levels of intracellular Mn have also been shown to contribute \n\nto resistance of bacteria to UVC radiation and ionizing radiation by mitigating protein \n\noxidation (Daly et al., 2004; Ghosh et al., 2011; Granger et al., 2011). The protective \n\neffect of Mn against protein carbonylation seems to stem from its ability to metallate \n\nmononuclear enzymes containing Fe-S clusters, thereby replacing Fe ions and \n\npreventing the formation of damaging hydroxyl radicals (Anjem et al., 2009). \n\nAdditionally, Mn is also able to form complexes with metabolites that can scavenge \n\nsuperoxide, H2O2 and hydroxyl radicals (Daly et al., 2010). Accordingly, cell \n\nsuspensions added of Mn showed significantly lower (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05) ROS \n\ngeneration, compared to the unamended counterparts. Surprisingly, the protective effect \n\nof Mn against protein carbonylation and ROS generation was accompanied by a \n\nstatistically significant reduction in survival during exposure to UVB, compared to non-\n\namended controls, and in three of the strains tested, a significant increase in DNA \n\ndamage was observed. The reason for such effects is still unclear, in face of current \n\nknowledge. Recently, a transcriptomic study surveying UVC effects on Deinococcus \n\ngobiensis reported an over twofold reduction in the levels of the Mn transporter mntA, \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n144 \n\nthus suggesting reduced Mn influx during irradiation (Yuan et al., 2012). It has been \n\nsuggested that, by replacing Fe ions in the Fe-S clusters of proteins, Mn can selectively \n\nprotect the function of metabolic pathways (e.g., pentose phosphate pathway), which \n\nmay or may not be favourable for survival depending on the stressful condition (Berlett \n\net al., 1990; Sobota and Imlay, 2011). Such replacement could have also compromised \n\nthe correct functioning of the biochemical pathways on which these proteins participate, \n\nresulting in a detrimental effect on survival during UV exposure.  \n\nThe intracellular Mn/Fe concentration ratio is also crucial in determining the \n\nprotective effect of manganese against ionizing radiation (Daly et al., 2004; Daly et al., \n\n2007). For example, Neisseria gonorrhoeae accumulates Mn2+, but is sensitive to \n\nionizing radiation due to its high requirement for Fe2+ (Archibald and Duong, 1986). It \n\nshould be noted that the concentrations of Mn used in this study were chosen so that no \n\nsignificant effects on bacterial survival, activity and markers of oxidative stress were \n\nobserved in the respective dark controls, in order to minimize the possible confounding \n\neffects of metal toxicity in the UV response. As a result, concentrations used were up to \n\n25 times lower than those reported in similar studies (Daly et al., 2004; Ghosh et al., \n\n2011; Granger et al., 2011), which could have hindered the detection of a potential \n\nprotective role of Mn in UVB-induced damage that might require higher concentrations \n\nof manganese. Further studies are required to elucidate the role of Mn in photooxidative \n\nstress in bacteria. \n\n \n\nExperimental limitations on the determination of metal oxidation status \n\nThe oxidation status of transition metals is important in determining their \n\nbiological effects. The cycling between oxidation states is involved in oxidative stress, \n\nas in the case of Cu and Fe. When Cu2+ enters the cell it is readily reduced to the toxic \n\nCu+ form which establishes complexes with thiol groups and certain amino acid \n\nresidues, such as cysteine or ascorbic acid (Silver and Phung, 2005). In Escherichia coli \n\nthe CueO protein in the periplasm converts Cu+ into the less permeable and thus less \n\ntoxic Cu2+ (Singh et al., 2004). Metal iron, on the other hand, can be readily acquired by \n\nbacteria through the reduction of insoluble Fe3+ to soluble and potentially more toxic \n\nFe2+, followed by transport of Fe2+ to the cytoplasm (Kammler et al., 1993; Braun et al., \n\n1998). \n\nCycling between oxidation states is also involved in the protective effect of Mn \n\nagainst oxidative stress. Quenching of the superoxide radical and peroxyl radical species \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n145 \n\nby Mn2+ results in the formation of Mn3+ species, which are stabilized by coordination \n\nligands such as pyrophosphate or carboxylic acids, thus lowering the redox potential of \n\nthe Mn2+-Mn3+ couple (Stadtman et al., 1990).  \n\nHowever, the ability of metal ions to undergo redox cyclying poses some \n\ncomplications in terms of experimental work. For example, while free Cu2+ ions are \n\nstable in air-exposed neutral aqueous solutions, free Cu+ can only be maintained at very \n\nacidic pH or in complexed forms (Magnani and Solioz, 2007). In the case of iron, in the \n\npresence of oxygen at a pH of ?7, Fe2+ is readily converted into the almost completely \n\ninsoluble Fe3+ (Crossley et al., 2007). \n\nAnother difficulty in the study of the interaction between cells and metals is the \n\nability of metals to form complexes with biological molecules, which compromises the \n\ndetermination of the actual concentration of free, bioavailable metal in a biological \n\nsystem (Magnani and Solioz, 2007). Accordingly, by using a complex growth medium \n\nlike TGY it is likely that some of the metal added to the bacterial cultures could have \n\ncomplexed with the components of the medium and it is therefore virtually impossible \n\nto predict the metallic species present in the system. However, it is unlikely that in \n\nnatural aquatic systems these metals are freely available in solution in their cationic \n\nform, which makes our experimental conditions more similar to what probably occurs in \n\nthe environment, than using, for instance, solution buffers with low metal-binding \n\nproperties. \n\n \n\nConclusions \n\nMetal amendment generally acted synergistically with UVB exposure to \n\npromote bacterial inactivation. Fe and Cu amendment exacerbated oxidative damage \n\nduring UVB exposure, highlighting the importance of regulating the availability of these \n\nmetals in the cell in response to irradiation. Mn attenuated the UV-induced formation of \n\nprotein carbonyls but had a negative impact on survival, suggesting that displaced Fe \n\nions might promote oxidative damage in other targets of the cell. Furthermore, the \n\nobservation of some differences in the responses of Gram-negative and Gram-positive \n\nbacteria to the synergistic effects of metal amendment and irradiation (data not shown) \n\nmight suggest that the presence of metals in the environment could influence the effects \n\nof UV exposure on bacterial community composition. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n146 \n\nAcknowledgments  \n\nAcknowledgments are due to Prof. Dr. Amparo Faustino (Chemistry Department, University of Aveiro) \n\nfor carefully reviewing the preliminary version of the manuscript and providing access to the \n\nspectrofluorimeter.

M., Henriques I., Almeida A., Correia A., Cunha A. \n\nSubmitted for publication \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nThe influence of nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) availability and the \n\nproperties of the suspension medium on the UV sensitivity responses of two distinct \n\nbacterial assemblages (bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton) was assessed in laboratory \n\nexperiments in which marine and brackish water communities were inoculated in (i) \n\nwater of different nutrient contents (unamended and amended with high and low \n\nnutrient concentrations) and (ii) water of different origins (surface and subsurface). The \n\neffects on bacterial abundance and activity (leucine incorporation) were determined. \n\nAdditionally, the influence of the suspension media on UV sensitivity responses was \n\nalso studied in a set of bacterial isolates.  \n\nInoculation of bacterial communities in high nutrient medium attenuated UV-\n\ninduced inhibition (by up to 34.2 % for abundance and 54.4 % for activity) compared to \n\nunamended conditions. Under nutrient depleted conditions, marine bacterioneuston was \n\nless affected by UV radiation than marine bacterioplankton (by up to 17.8 % for \n\nabundance and 21.4 % for activity). In brackish water, nutrient conditions did not affect \n\ninactivation but high nutrient concentrations attenuated the UV-induced inhibition of \n\nactivity (up to 53.2 %). Suspension in natural water resulted in less pronounced \n\ninhibitory effects of UV exposure compared to suspensions prepared in a mineral \n\nsolution (by up to 11.8 % for abundance and 13.2 % for activity). The effects of the \n\ndifferent suspension media were more variable on isolated strains than in mixed \n\nassemblages.  \n\nThese results demonstrate that the nutrient content and quality of the suspension \n\nmedium affect bacterial photobiological responses and that the abiotic environment of \n\nbacterial communities influences their UV sensitivity. \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \n\n148 \n\nIntroduction \n\nIn aquatic ecosystems, UV radiation (UVR) can reach considerable depths (> 20 \n\nm) in the water column (Smith, 1989). Climate changes, namely, warming, acidification \n\nand modifications of ocean stratification patterns, are expected to increase the \n\npenetration of UVB wavelengths (280-320 nm) in the water column and enhance the \n\nexposure of aquatic organisms to UVB in forthcoming years (Andrady et al., 2010). \n\nThese concerns make the study of the effects of UVB radiation on the structure and \n\nfunction of aquatic microbial communities a critical and timely subject. \n\nField and laboratory studies indicate that exposure to UVR results in a general \n\ndecrease in total bacterial abundance (M\u00fcller-Niklas et al., 1995; Pakulski et al., 1998), \n\nmonomer incorporation (Bailey et al., 1983; Santos et al., 2011a), exoenzymatic \n\nactivities (M\u00fcller-Niklas et al., 1995; Santos et al., 2011a), oxygen consumption \n\n(Pakulski et al., 1998; Joux et al., 2009), protein and DNA synthesis (Herndl et al., \n\n1993; Sommaruga et al., 1997; Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2007; Joux et al., 2009; Santos et al., \n\n2012b) and single-cell activity (Alonso-S\u00e1ez et al., 2006). \n\nUVB radiation has both direct and indirect effects on cells. The direct effects of \n\nUVB result from the absorption of UV photons by DNA and proteins (Cadet et al., \n\n2005b; Pattison and Davies, 2006). Additionally, damage can arise as a result of \n\nphotosensitized reactions whereby a photosensitizer (endogenous or exogenous) absorbs \n\nlight, enters an excited state and initiates damaging photodynamic reactions that can \n\naffect lipids, proteins and DNA (Chamberlain and Moss, 1987; Moan and Peak, 1989; \n\nGirotti, 2001; Pattison and Davies, 2006). Endogenous photosensitizers include \n\nporphyrin derivatives and flavins present inside the cell, while exogenous \n\nphotosensitizers include humic substances and photosynthetic pigments (Curtis et al., \n\n1992).  \n\nThe impact of solar UVR on marine microorganisms is complex and depends on \n\nboth the radiation levels received and on several environmental (temperature, salinity, \n\nand nutrients) (Ogbebo and Ochs, 2008; Joux et al., 2009; Bullock and Jeffrey, 2010; \n\nMatallana-Surget et al., 2010) and biological (specific sensitivity, repair mechanisms, \n\nnutritional state, and growth phase) (Berney et al., 2006c; Bucheli-Witschel et al., 2010) \n\nfactors. Nutrients, in particular, can influence susceptibility to UVR by affecting the \n\npenetration of radiation in the water body (Joux et al., 2009) or altering bacterial \n\nphysiology (Chrzanowski and Kyle, 1996; Bowden and Li, 1997; Ferenci, 1999; \n\nKlan?nik et al., 2009).  \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \n\n149 \n\nThe light history of a bacterial assemblage can also affect the response of \n\nbacterial communities to UVR. For example, exposure to solar radiation inhibits \n\nbacterial productivity in surface waters (0.5 m) but stimulates activity in deep waters \n\n(80 m) (Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2007). The reduced sensitivity of bacterioneuston inhabiting \n\nthe top millimetre of the water column (or surface microlayer, SML) compared to \n\nbacterioplankton inhabiting underlying waters (UW) is also considered indicative of the \n\ninfluence of light history on the effects exerted by UVR on bacterial communities \n\n(Santos et al., 2011a). Accumulation of exopolysaccharides and chromophoric dissolved \n\nand particulate organic matter at the air-water interface has also been suggested to \n\naccount for the enhanced resistance of bacterioneuston to solar radiation (Elasri and \n\nMiller, 1999; Whitehead and Vernet, 2000; Obernosterer et al., 2005). However, \n\nexogenous photosensitizers, such as humic substances and phenolic compounds, which \n\ncan affect bacterial photobiological responses (Muela et al., 2000), concentrate at the \n\nSML (Liss, 1975; Carlson, 1982) and may influence the UV sensitivity responses of \n\nmicroorganisms at the air-water interface.  \n\nThe objectives of this work were to study the role of nutrients and suspension \n\nmedium on the UV sensitivity of bacterioplankton and bacterioneuston. Additionally, \n\nthe variability of the effects of different suspension media on UV-induced damage was \n\nalso addressed in a set of bacterial isolates.  \n\n \n\nMaterials and methods \n\nSampling  \n\nSamples were collected from an outer oligotrophic marine section (CN, 40\u00ba 38\u2019 \n\nN, 08\u00ba 46\u2019 W) and an inner mesotrophic brackish water section (I6, 40\u00ba 35\u2019 N, 08\u00ba 41\u2019 \n\nW) of Ria de Aveiro (Portugal). Sampling was conducted on three consecutive days in \n\nJune 2010, around the time of the summer solstice when UVB levels are the highest \n\n(Seckmeyer et al., 2008). Daily solar radiation levels on the period of sampling ranged \n\nfrom 30 to 35 kJ m-2 (climetua.fis.ua.pt/legacy/main/current_monitor/cesamet.htm). At \n\nthe moment of sampling, the sky was clear with minimum wind conditions (&lt;2 m s-1). \n\nSamples were collected approximately at noon at high tide. This time was previously \n\ndetermined as the moment during the tide that best corresponded to minimum \n\ndifferences in chromophoric dissolved organic matter (cDOM) concentrations (an \n\nindicator of the optical properties of water samples) between water from the SML and \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \n\n150 \n\nUW (data not shown) to minimize the interference of optical properties in UV \n\nsensitivity responses of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton.  \n\nTwo 0.25-m x 0.35-m glass plates that roughly collect the upper 60-100 \u00b5 m of \n\nthe water column were used for bacterioneuston sampling (Harvey and Burzell, 1972). \n\nSML water was transferred to acid-rinsed sterilized glass bottles. Samples from \n\nunderlying water were taken directly by submerging acid-rinsed sterilized glass bottles \n\nto a depth of approximately 20 cm. The samples were maintained in the shade at 4 \u00baC \n\nduring the transport to the laboratory and were processed within 3 h of collection. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 9.1. Schematic representation of the experimental setup used to test the influence of nutrients and suspension media on the UV \n\nsensitivity responses of bacterioneuston, bacterioplankton and bacterial isolates.

Chlorophyll a was estimated \n\nfluorometrically (Yentsch and Menzel, 1963) after filtration of 100 mL triplicate \n\nsamples through Whatman GF/C glass filters (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and \n\novernight cold extraction in 90 % (v/v) acetone. Samples for nutrient analysis were \n\nfiltered through 0.45-\u00b5m-pore-size cellulose acetate membrane filters (GE Osmonics \n\nLabstore, Minnetonka, MN). Nutrient concentrations (dissolved inorganic nitrogen, \n\nphosphate, silicate and ammonia) were determined using standard procedures \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \n\n151 \n\n(Grasshoff et al., 1983). A spectrophotometer (Thermo, Spectronic Genesys 10UV, \n\nUSA) and Merck reagents were used in all determinations. The determination of the \n\nconcentration of suspended solids (seston) was performed after filtration of 500 mL \n\ntriplicate samples through Whatman GF/C (47 mm diam.) pre-weighted, pre-combusted \n\nfilters. The filters were dried at 60 \u00b0C for 24 h, and the seston content was calculated as \n\nthe difference in weight. Particulate organic matter (POM) was determined by the \n\ndifference in the weight of the dry seston filters after 4 h incineration at 525 \u00b0C (Parsons \n\net al., 1984). Particulate organic carbon (POC) was calculated as 50 % of the POM \n\n(Rodier, 1996). \n\n \n\nPreparation of dilution cultures \n\nAn overview of the experimental layout, identifying the conditions that were \n\nexperimentally manipulated, is presented in Fig. 9.1. \n\n \n\nInfluence of nutrient concentration  \n\n Dilution cultures were prepared as previously described (Pausz and Herndl, \n\n2002). Water samples from the SML and UW were pre-filtered and filtered through 0.8-\n\nand 0.4-\u00b5m-pore-size polycarbonate filters (Millipore), respectively, to remove particles \n\nand most phytoplankton and zooplankton cells. The filtrate containing the &lt;0.4 \u00b5 m \n\nfraction was taken as the inoculum and used in a 1:10 (v/v) proportion to obtain cell \n\ndilution cultures in artificial mineral solution (AMS, 0.009 M KCl, 0.009 M \n\nCaCl2\u00b7 2H2O, 0.026 M MgSO4\u00b7 7H2O, 0.023 M MgCl2\u00b7 6H2O, and 0.002 M NaHCO3) \n\ncontaining 0.425 M NaCl for marine samples or 0.213 M NaCl for brackish water \n\nsamples. Suspensions were then amended with a mixture of amino acids (L-arginine, L-\n\nhistidine, L-isoleucine, L-leucine, L-lysine, L-methionine, L-phenylalanine, L-\n\nthreonine, L-tryptophan, and L-valine) (0.4 \u00b5 M), glucose (100 or 20 \u00b5 M), NH4\n+ (10 or 2 \n\n\u00b5 M) and PO4\n3\u2013 (1 or 0.2 \u00b5 M) at different concentrations to simulate high- and low-\n\nnutrient availability, as previously described (Pausz and Herndl, 2002). Cultures were \n\nincubated at 25 \u00baC in the dark for 24 h. Subsequently, the dilution cultures were split in \n\naliquots to which PO4\n3\u2013 (40 or 8 \u00b5 M) and NH4\n\n+ (4 or 0.8 \u00b5 M) were added at different \n\nconcentrations to establish high nutrient and low nutrient conditions. Nutrient-\n\nunamended samples were prepared as described for nutrient amendments, except that no \n\nPO4\n3\u2013 or NH4\n\n+ was added to the dilution cultures. After 12 h, cultures were irradiated as \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \n\n152 \n\ndescribed below. Bacterial activity and abundance were determined immediately before \n\nand after irradiation. \n\n \n\nInfluence of dissolved components of the suspension medium  \n\n Marine and brackish bacterioneuston (SML) and bacterioplankton (UW) inocula \n\n(&lt;0.4 \u00b5 m filtrates) prepared as described above were diluted (1:10) in 0.2-\u00b5 m-pore-size \n\nfiltered water from the SML and UW of the corresponding estuarine site (marine or \n\nbrackish) and incubated at 25 \u00baC in the dark for 24 h before irradiation. The following \n\nexperimental conditions were tested: (i) bacterioneuston inoculum in SML water, (ii) \n\nbacterioneuston inoculum in UW water, (iii) bacterioplankton inoculum in SML water, \n\nand (iv) bacterioplankton inoculum in UW water. Bacterial suspensions were irradiated \n\nas described below. Bacterial activity and abundance were determined immediately \n\nbefore and after irradiation. \n\n \n\nBioassays with bacterial isolates \n\nTo evaluate the interspecies variability of the influence of the suspension \n\nmedium during UVB irradiation, bioassays were conducted with environmental \n\nbacterial isolates (Micrococcus sp., Paracoccus sp., Pseudomonas sp., and \n\nStaphylococcus sp.) selected by their differences in terms of UVB sensitivity (Santos et \n\nal., 2011b). Fresh cultures were prepared in Marine Broth 2216 (Difco, Detroit, MI), \n\nand cells were harvested by centrifugation (3,200 \u00d7g for 15 min; Thermo Scientific \n\nHeraeus Pico 21 Microcentrifuge, Hamburg, Germany) in late-exponential phase. The \n\npellets were washed three times with filter-sterilized autoclaved 0.9 % NaCl and \n\nresuspended in the same solution, and the bacterial abundance was adjusted to 107 cells \n\nmL-1. Bacterial suspensions were then diluted (1:10) in AMS or in 0.2-\u00b5 m-pore-size \n\nfiltered samples of SML and UW from the marine or brackish water sites. \n\n \n\nIrradiation conditions \n\nDilution cultures or cell suspensions were transferred to sterile 150 x 25 mm \n\nplastic tissue culture dishes (Corning Science Products, Corning, NY, USA) so that the \n\ndepth of the liquid was &lt;2 mm. For irradiation, the lid was removed, and cell \n\nsuspensions were exposed to UVB (Philips TL 100 W/01 lamps, main emission \n\nwavelength line of 302 nm) for a total dose of 37 kJ m-2, approximately corresponding \n\nto UV levels detected in the field at the sampling period. UV intensities were measured \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \n\n153 \n\nwith a monochromator spectro-radiometer placed at the sample level (DM 300, \n\nBentham Instruments, Reading, UK). During irradiation, the temperature was \n\nmaintained at 25 \u00baC. Dark controls (covered in aluminum foil) for every experimental \n\ncondition, treated in the same way as the irradiated samples, were always included. \n\nAliquots of cell suspensions were collected before and after irradiation to assess \n\nbacterial abundance and activity. All experiments were conducted in three independent \n\nassays. \n\n \n\nBacterial abundance \n\nBacterial abundance was determined by epifluorescence microscopy (Hobbie et \n\nal., 1977) after fixing triplicate samples from each condition tested with 2 % \n\nformaldehyde (final concentration). Samples were then filtered through 0.2-\u00b5 m-pore-\n\nsize black polycarbonate membranes (Poretics Products, Livermore, USA) and stained \n\nwith 0.03 % acridine orange (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Michigan, USA). Cells were \n\ncounted by epifluorescence microscopy using a Leitz Laborlux K microscope equipped \n\nwith a BP 450-490 exciter filter and an LP 515 barrier filter (Leitz Me\u00dftechnik, Wetzlar, \n\nGermany). At least 200 cells or 20 microscopic fields were counted for each of the three \n\nreplicate measurements for each condition tested.  \n\n \n\nBacterial activity \n\nBacterial activity was estimated from the rates of [3H]leucine incorporation \n\n(Smith and Azam, 1992). Triplicate 1.5-mL sample aliquots and a 5 % TCA-fixed \n\ncontrol were incubated with a mixture of [3H]leucine (Amersham Biosciences, \n\nBuckinghamshire, UK; specific activity 160 Ci mmoL?1) and nonradioactive leucine at \n\na previously determined saturating concentration of 83 nM and 483 nM for \n\nenvironmental samples and suspensions of bacterial isolates, respectively. Samples were \n\nincubated in the dark at in situ temperatures for 1 h. Incubations were stopped by the \n\naddition of TCA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) to a final concentration of 5 %; then, the \n\nsamples were centrifuged at 16,000 \u00d7g for 10 min (Thermo Scientific Heraeus Pico 21 \n\nMicrocentrifuge, Hamburg, Germany). The supernatant was discarded, and 1.5 mL of 5 \n\n% TCA was added. The mixture was vortexed, centrifuged and the supernatant was \n\ndiscarded. The pellet was washed with 90 % ethanol, dried overnight at room \n\ntemperature and resuspended in 1.0 mL Universol liquid scintillation cocktail (ICN \n\nBiomedicals, USA). The radioactivity incorporated into bacterial cells was measured \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \n\n154 \n\nafter 3 days in a Beckman LS 6000 IC Liquid Scintillation Counter (Beckman Coulter, \n\nInc., USA). \n\n \n\nStatistical analysis \n\nAll experiments were repeated in three independent assays, and parameters were \n\nalways determined in triplicate. Differences between treatments were assessed by a one-\n\nway ANOVA using the statistical software SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago IL). \n\nThe Levene test was used to assess homogeneity of variances. If variances were not \n\nhomogeneous, the natural logarithm transformation was applied. If variances were still \n\nnot homogenous, a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was used to assess the overall \n\neffect of treatment. \n\n \n\nResults \n\nWater properties \n\nThe physical, chemical and biological properties of the original samples of \n\nbacterioneuston and bacterioplankton are summarized in Table 9.1. \n\n \n\nTable 9.1.

Inoculation in UW did \n\nnot affect bacterial inactivation but attenuated the reduction of activity during \n\nirradiation by 7.4 % compared to the AMS treatment. The variation of abundance and \n\nactivity was similar in SML and UW cell suspensions (Fig. 9.3 A, B, Table 9.2). For \n\nmarine bacterioplankton, significant (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05) attenuations in the \n\nreduction in bacterial abundance (up to 11.1 %) and activity (up to 12.0 %) during \n\nirradiation were observed upon inoculation in SML and UW compared to AMS (Fig. \n\n9.3 A, B, Table 9.2).  \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \n\n158 \n\nFor brackish bacterioneuston, significant differences in terms of inactivation \n\nbetween the different suspension media were not observed. Inoculation in SML \n\nattenuated the UV-induced reduction in activity by 12.0 % (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05) \n\ncompared to AMS dilution cultures, whereas the reduction in activity in samples \n\ninoculated in UW and AMS was not significantly different (Fig. 9.3 A, B, Table 9.2). \n\nFor brackish bacterioplankton, inoculation in SML attenuated the UV-induced reduction \n\nin abundance and activity by 8.4 and 9.6 %, respectively, compared to the AMS \n\ntreatment, whereas inoculation in UW did not significantly affect the reduction in \n\nabundance and activity compared to the dilutions in AMS (Fig. 9.3 A, B, Table 9.2).  \n\nIn marine and brackish water samples, the inhibition of bacterial abundance and \n\nactivity by UV radiation was generally higher in bacterioplankton than in \n\nbacterioneuston by up to 19.9 and 15.7 %, respectively (Fig. 9.3 A, B, Table 9.3). \n\n \n\nFig. 9.4.

Data are presented as \n\nthe group means \u00b1 standard deviations of the mean of three experiments. The absence of error bars indicates that standard deviations \n\nare too small to see on the scale used. \n\n \n\nBioassays with bacterial isolates \n\nTo address the interspecies variability of the effects of the suspension medium \n\non UV sensitivity, four bacterial isolates were tested for their photobiological responses \n\nupon inoculation in AMS and in marine or brackish water of the SML or UW. Dark \n\ncontrols were included for all treatments but are not shown in the figures for simplicity \n\nbecause these controls were not significantly different (1-way ANOVA, p > 0.05) from \n\nthe dark controls performed in AMS.  \n\nDepending on the isolate, inactivation compared to that observed in AMS ranged \n\nfrom 4.0 % less to 7.0 % more in marine SML water, from 3.0 % less to 11.7 % more in \n\nmarine UW, from 23.1 % less to 17.8 % more in brackish SML water and from 5.9 % \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \n\n159 \n\nless to 6.7 % more in brackish UW (Fig. 9.4 A, see Table 9.4 for statistical \n\nsignificance). \n\nSimilar results were observed for leucine incorporation.

In the present work, we compared the influence of \n\nthe availability of inorganic nutrients and the type of the suspension medium on the UV \n\nresponses of estuarine bacterial communities that are naturally exposed to different \n\nnutrient and light regimes (bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton) and that originate \n\nfrom different sites within an estuary (marine and brackish water). The variability of the \n\neffects of the suspension medium on different bacterial isolates was also assessed.  \n\n \n\nEffects of nutrient concentration \n\nInhibition by UV radiation, in terms of abundance and activity, was generally \n\nattenuated when the suspension medium was amended with high nutrient concentrations \n\n(40 \u00b5 M NH4\n+ and 4 \u00b5 M PO4\n\n3-). Repair processes elicited in response to UVR require \n\nnitrogen for synthesis of proteins involved in DNA repair and ROS scavenging and thus \n\ncan potentially be inhibited by a limitation in nitrogen supply (Beardall et al., 2009). \n\nThese repair processes are also energy dependent, requiring ATP, and are consequently \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \n\n160 \n\nsusceptible to limitation in the supply of organic matter and inorganic phosphorus \n\n(Beardall et al., 2009). Our results indicate that the high nutrient amendments may have \n\nprovided sufficient amounts of the elements required for nucleic acid and protein \n\nsynthesis, including those involved in repair of UV-induced damage, which were likely \n\nnot fulfilled with the low nutrient regime. Such observations are in accordance with \n\nprevious reports of the ability of nutrient inputs to promote recovery from UV-induced \n\ndamage (Joux et al., 2009).  \n\nIn general, under the unamended (AMS) and low nutrient conditions, \n\nbacterioneuston was more resistant to UV inactivation than bacterioplankton. The \n\ndifferences in UV sensitivity of the two communities, particularly of those originating \n\nfrom the brackish water site, were attenuated upon amendment with high nutrient \n\nconcentrations. Rapidly growing cells are considered to be more sensitive to \n\ninactivation than slow growing cells due to the shorter time interval required for \n\nexcision repair between subsequent rounds of replication (Harm, 1980; Jagger, 1985). In \n\nthe original samples, bacterioplankton growth rates, estimated from bacterial secondary \n\nproduction and bacterial biomass (Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2006), were up to 25 % higher than \n\nthose of bacterioneuston (data not shown). Leucine incorporation is also enhanced at the \n\nUW, though bacterial abundance is higher in the SML (Lindroos et al., 2011; Santos et \n\nal., 2012b). The higher growth rates of bacterioplankton could be a contributing factor \n\nfor its higher susceptibility to UVR observed in the present work and previous reports \n\n(Santos et al., 2011a; Santos et al., 2012b). Low bacterial growth rates at the SML have \n\nbeen reported by other authors and attributed to the low lability of dissolved organic \n\ncompounds (e.g., free amino acids) accumulating in this layer (Reinthaler et al., 2008). \n\nTaken together, these observations may suggest that bacterial cells at the SML are \n\nintrinsically adapted to nutritional stress and thus are less affected in their UV \n\nsensitivity by variations in nutrient concentrations. This finding is in agreement with our \n\nprevious observations of the enhanced ability of starved bacterioneuston isolates to \n\nrecover from UV-induced damage compared to bacterioplankton isolates in the same \n\nnutritional conditions (Santos et al., 2012a). \n\nDifferences in the community composition of bacterial assemblages from the \n\nSML and UW at the oligotrophic and mesotrophic estuarine sites may also account for \n\nthe differences in the observed responses. Marine and brackish water bacterial \n\ncommunities from Ria de Aveiro (Portugal) are physiologically (Almeida et al., 2001) \n\nand structurally (Henriques et al., 2006a) distinct. Bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \n\n161 \n\ncommunity structure in this estuary also seems to differ, as suggested by the occurrence \n\nof SML-specific bacterial members affiliated with Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, \n\nGammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes (Azevedo et al., 2012), as well as the \n\ndominance of the UV-resistant Gammaproteobacteria in bacterioneuston (Santos et al., \n\n2012b). \n\n \n\nInfluence of dissolved components of the suspension medium \n\nThe influence of dissolved components of the suspension media on the UV-\n\ninduced effects on bacterial communities was tested by inoculating bacterial \n\nassemblages in cell-free water from the SML or UW. The effects of irradiation on \n\nbacterial numbers and activity were monitored and compared to those observed in an \n\nartificial medium (AMS). For marine communities of bacterioneuston and \n\nbacterioplankton, suspension in SML and UW attenuated the inhibitory effects of UV \n\nradiation. In brackish water bacterial communities, the UV-induced effects on \n\nabundance and activity were generally attenuated upon suspension in SML water.  \n\nAttenuation of the inhibitory effects of UV exposure in bacterial communities \n\nirradiated in SML and/or UW compared to the AMS treatment may be due to \n\nstimulation of bacterial metabolism by low molecular weight compounds resulting from \n\nthe photolytic cleavage of DOM present in environmental samples (Amador et al., 1989; \n\nBushaw et al., 1996; Moran and Zepp, 1997; Bertilsson and Tranvik, 1998; \n\nObernosterer et al., 1999), thus compensating for the direct negative effects of \n\nirradiation. Furthermore, natural environmental samples could have provided the cells \n\nwith nutrients necessary for the synthesis of repair proteins (Beardall et al., 2009), \n\nallowing them to cope with the effects of irradiation better than those maintained in \n\nAMS. Finally, a shield and quenching effect of DOC and humic materials present in the \n\nenvironmental samples (Muela et al., 2000; Bracchini et al., 2005) may have also \n\nmitigated the inhibitory effects of irradiation in samples diluted in SML and/or UW, \n\ncompared to samples in AMS. Together, these results demonstrate that the medium in \n\nwhich bacteria are suspended influences the effects of UV radiation and also suggest the \n\nimportance of the SML and UW abiotic environments in determining the UV responses \n\nof the corresponding bacterial communities.  \n\nAdditionally, to gain further insights into the influence of the irradiating medium \n\non UVR sensitivity, bioassays were also conducted with individual isolated strains. \n\nBacterial isolates were inoculated in different suspension media, and variations of \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \n\n162 \n\nabundance and activity with irradiation were determined. The responses of the different \n\nisolates to the tested treatments were widely variable, either protecting or accentuating \n\nthe inhibitory effects of UVB, depending on the suspension medium and the isolate. \n\nHowever, in general, brackish SML water attenuated the inhibitory effects of UVR on \n\ncell activity. The protective effect of inoculation in brackish water may have resulted \n\nfrom a shield effect of organic matter and humic compounds concentrated in these \n\nsamples and/or from the enhanced production of low molecular weight compounds from \n\nthe phototransformation of DOM that was used for bacterial growth (Amador et al., \n\n1989; Bushaw et al., 1996; Moran and Zepp, 1997; Bertilsson and Tranvik, 1998; \n\nObernosterer et al., 1999; Muela et al., 2000; Bracchini et al., 2005).  \n\nThe variability in the effects of the suspension media in UV-induced inactivation \n\nand inhibition of activity observed in the different isolates may be attributed to \n\ninterspecies differences in protection and repair mechanisms (Fern\u00e1ndez Zenoff et al., \n\n2006b; Santos et al., 2011b). Alternatively, differences in the ability to use the products \n\nof phototransformation of DOM for bacterial growth can also contribute to the variable \n\neffects that each suspension medium exerted on the different bacterial isolates. For \n\nexample, Gammaproteobacteria are negatively affected by the photochemical alteration \n\nof cDOM or outcompeted by the other bacterial groups during phototransformation \n\nexperiments (Piccini et al., 2009), and Actinobacteria are favoured under those \n\ncircumstances (P\u00e9rez and Sommaruga, 2007). \n\nThese results indicate that the suspension medium in which bacteria are \n\nirradiated is important for determining the biological consequences of UV exposure, \n\nwhich likely depend on the compromise between the protective effects of organic \n\nmatter, the stimulatory effects of UV radiation mediated by the photolysis of organic \n\nmatter and the oxidative stress imposed by ROS generated during the process.  \n\n \n\nConclusions \n\nThe availability of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as the overall \n\ncomposition of the medium in which cell suspensions for irradiation experiments were \n\nprepared, influenced the UV effects on bacterial abundance and activity. Nutrient \n\namendment attenuated the inhibitory effects of UV exposure. Attenuation of the \n\ninhibitory effects of irradiation was also observed when cells were suspended in water \n\nfrom the SML and/or UW, compared to AMS. This effect likely occurs as a \n\nconsequence of photoreactions resulting in the formation of low molecular weight \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \n\n163 \n\ncompounds that promote bacterial growth or a shield effect by humic material present in \n\nnatural samples that compensates for the detrimental effects of UVR. These results \n\ndemonstrate that the role of UVR as an environmental regulator of the abundance and \n\nactivity of aquatic bacteria is modulated by interactions with abiotic water properties \n\nand can vary significantly in different aquatic niches. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nFinancial support for this work was provided by CESAM (Centre for Environmental and Marine Studies, \n\nUniversity of Aveiro) and the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) in the form of a \n\nPhD grant to A.L.

NT5I1.2B, was \n\nstudied at different growth phases (mid-exponential, late-exponential, and stationary), \n\ngrowth temperatures (15 \u00baC and 25 \u00baC) and growth media (nutrient-rich Tryptic Soy \n\nBroth [TSB] and nutrient-poor M9). Survival and markers of oxidative damage (lipid \n\nperoxidation, protein carbonylation, DNA strand breakage, and DNA-protein cross-\n\nlinks) were monitored during exposure to increasing UVB doses (0-60 kJ m-2).  \n\nOxidative damage did not follow a clear linear dose-dependent pattern, \n\nparticularly at medium-high UVB doses (> 10 kJ m-2), suggesting a dynamic interaction \n\nbetween damage induction and repair during irradiation and/or saturation of oxidative \n\ndamage. Survival of stationary phase cells generally exceeded that of exponential phase \n\ncells by up to 33.5 times; the latter displayed enhanced levels of DNA-protein cross-\n\nlinks (up to 15.6-fold) and protein carbonylation (up to 6.0-fold). Survival of mid-\n\nexponential phase cells was generally higher at 15 \u00baC than at 25 \u00baC (up to 6.6-fold), \n\nwhich was accompanied by lower levels of DNA strand breaks (up to 4,000-fold), \n\nsuggesting a temperature effect on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and/or \n\nROS interaction with cellular targets. Survival under medium-high UVB doses (> 10 kJ \n\nm-2) was generally higher (up to 5.4-fold) in cells grown in TSB than in M9.  \n\nThese results highlight the importance of growth conditions preceding \n\nirradiation on the extent of oxidative damage induced by UVB exposure in bacteria. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \n\n166 \n\nIntroduction \n\nBacteria are highly susceptible to solar radiation, particularly in the UV range, \n\ndue to their small size, short generation time, and the fact that their genetic material \n\ncomprises a significant portion of their cellular volume (Garcia-Pichel, 1994).  \n\nThe main biological effects of UVB radiation (280-320 nm) have traditionally \n\nbeen attributed to its ability to induce direct DNA damage (DNA photoproducts), most \n\nnotably cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts \n\n(Mitchell and Karentz, 1993). However, the observation of the accumulation of similar \n\nlevels of DNA photoproducts in bacteria with distinct UV sensitivities (Joux et al., \n\n1999; Matallana-Surget et al., 2008) and the fact that DNA damage alone cannot \n\naccount for the inhibitory effects of UV radiation on bacteria inhabiting surface waters \n\n(Visser et al., 2002) suggest that UV-induced damage to other biomolecules, \n\nparticularly lipids and proteins, may play a role in the inhibitory effects of UV radiation \n\non bacteria. \n\nThe action spectrum for UV effects does not correlate with the absorption \n\nspectrum of lipids. Therefore, UV-induced damage to lipids is likely to be a result of \n\nindirect oxidative damage mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Girotti, 2001). \n\nProteins are also key targets of photosensitized damage, which may cause functional \n\nchanges in structural and enzymatic proteins (Bosshard et al., 2010b). Proteins that \n\ncontain iron as a prosthetic metal are particularly noteworthy targets of oxidation \n\nthrough the Fenton reaction, being readily oxidizable by hydrogen peroxide (Beyer and \n\nFridovich, 1991; Tamarit et al., 1998; Murakami et al., 2006). Besides direct damage, \n\nDNA can also be damaged by ROS generated during photosensitized reactions, \n\nresulting in the formation of strand breaks, alkali-labile sites, and DNA-protein cross-\n\nlinks (Mitchell, 1995).  \n\nThe importance of oxidative damage in UVB-induced bacterial inactivation has \n\nrecently been highlight in studies directly quantifying oxidative stress markers during \n\nirradiation in a set of estuarine bacterial isolates (Santos et al., 2013), as well as studies \n\nreporting enhanced levels of transcripts and proteins involved in the response to \n\noxidative stress upon UVB exposure in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and \n\nPhotobacterium angustum S14 (Qiu et al., 2005a; Matallana-Surget et al., 2012). \n\nContrary to DNA dimers, which can be effectively reversed by photoreactivation, \n\noxidative damage resulting from ROS overproduction upon UVB exposure is more \n\ndifficult and energetically expensive to repair (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1999). These \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \n\n167 \n\nobservations make the study of UVB-induced oxidative damage in bacteria, and the \n\nfactors that influence it, of utmost importance. \n\nIt is well known that the biological response of microorganisms to UV radiation \n\nis influenced by multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Among extrinsic or \n\nenvironmental factors, temperature, nutrient concentration, and light availability have \n\nall been shown to affect the biological responses of microorganisms to UV radiation by \n\naffecting light penetration and/or the physiological condition of cells, with variable \n\nresults (Pausz and Herndl, 2002; Bullock and Jeffrey, 2010; Matallana-Surget et al., \n\n2010). For example, the effects of increased temperature on UV sensitivity have been \n\nreported to be non-significant in Escherichia coli (Gay\u00e1n et al., 2011), protective in \n\nbacterioplankton (Bullock and Jeffrey, 2010), and detrimental in Sphingopyxis \n\nalaskensis (Matallana-Surget et al., 2010).  \n\nIntrinsic properties of microorganisms also influence the biological \n\nconsequences of UV exposure. For example, cell size, by affecting the pathway of light \n\npenetration, seems to contribute to the vulnerability for DNA damage accumulation in \n\nplanktonic organisms, with smaller cells displaying higher levels of DNA damage \n\n(Karentz et al., 1991; Garcia-Pichel, 1994; Buma et al., 2001). Cell-specific growth rate \n\nis also a key determinant of the effects of UVA (Berney et al., 2006c) and UVC \n\nexposure in E. coli (Bucheli-Witschel et al., 2010). UVA effects have also been found to \n\ndepend on the growth phase, with stationary phase cells recovering faster and being \n\nmore resistant to the lethal effects of irradiation than exponential growing cells (Dantur \n\nand Pizarro, 2004). Other authors have reported that, at least in S. alaskensis, the growth \n\nphase does not affect total DNA photoproduct formation during exposure to simulated \n\nsolar radiation (Matallana-Surget et al., 2010). However, to our knowledge, studies on \n\nthe influence of intrinsic and extrinsic properties on UVB-induced oxidative damage in \n\nbacteria are virtually nonexistent. \n\nThe present work aimed to study the influence of the growth conditions of cells \n\n(growth phase, growth temperature and growth medium) and light dose on UVB-\n\ninduced oxidative damage to DNA, lipids, and proteins in bacteria. \n\n \n\nMaterials and methods \n\nBacterial strain and growth conditions \n\nThe bacterial strain used in this study (Pseudomonas sp. strain NT5I1.2B, NCBI \n\naccession number GU084169) was isolated from the surface waters of the estuarine \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \n\n168 \n\nsystem of Ria de Aveiro (Portugal) (Santos et al., 2011b). This strain shows a 98 % 16S \n\nrRNA gene similarity with the hexazinone-degrading Pseudomonas kuykendallii strain \n\nH2A and a 97 % 16S rRNA gene similarity with Pseudomonas putida strain DAPG5. \n\nPseudomonas sp. strain NT5I1.2B shows a minimal growth temperature of 9\u00b11 \u00baC and a \n\nmaximal growth temperature of 37\u00b11 \u00baC. The optimal growth temperature of the strain \n\nis 27\u00b11 \u00baC (data not shown). A Gammaproteobacteria strain was selected because this \n\nlineage seems to dominate UV-exposed surface waters and has been proposed to be \n\nUV-resistant (Franklin et al., 2005; Alonso-S\u00e1ez et al., 2006; Santos et al., 2012b). \n\nFurthermore, Pseudomonas strains seem to be particularly enriched in the sunlit surface \n\nmicrolayer of the Ria de Aveiro estuary which could suggest enhanced resistance of the \n\ngenera to environmental stress factors at the estuarine water surface, particularly \n\nenhanced UV levels (Azevedo et al., 2012; Santos et al., 2012b). Finally, the resistance \n\nand repair mechanisms of the Pseudomonas genus have been well studied (Kokjohn and \n\nMiller, 1985; Simonson et al., 1990; Kokjohn and Miller, 1994; Kidambi et al., 1996).  \n\nThe strain was grown in either nutrient-rich Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB, Difco \n\nLaboratories, Detroit, Mich.) or nutrient-poor M9 medium (22 mM KH2PO4, 42 mM \n\nNa2HPO4, 19 mM NH4Cl, 9 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgSO4 and 0.09 mM CaCl2 , pH 6.8, \n\ncontaining 5.5 mM glucose as a carbon source) adjusted to 36 PSU (Practical Salinity \n\nUnits) at 15 \u00baC or 25 \u00baC with agitation (120 rpm). The temperatures 15 \u00baC or 25 \u00baC were \n\nchosen because they represent the approximate maximum and minimum temperatures \n\ndetected in the estuarine system of Ria de Aveiro throughout the year (Santos et al., \n\n2011c). Aliquots were collected at pre-determined intervals and the absorbance at 600 \n\nnm (OD600) was measured in a Thermo Spectronic Genesys 10 UV spectrophotometer \n\n(Thermo Fisher Scientific SL, Alcobendas, Spain) and used to construct the respective \n\ngrowth curves. Cells in the mid-exponential phase, late-exponential phase and stationary \n\nphase grown in the different media and at different temperatures were used for \n\nsubsequent irradiation experiments. These growth phases were chosen because they \n\ncorrespond to the growth phases that have most commonly been used in studies of UV \n\neffects on bacteria (Joux et al., 1999; Arrieta et al., 2000; Qiu et al., 2004; Agogu\u00e9 et al., \n\n2005; Fern\u00e1ndez Zenoff et al., 2006b; H\u00f6rtnagl et al., 2011; Santos et al., 2011b; Santos \n\net al., 2012a).  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \n\n169 \n\nTotal bacterial number (TBN) and cell biovolume \n\nCells in the different growth conditions were characterized in terms of total \n\nbacterial number (TBN) and biovolume. For the determination of TBN, samples were \n\nfiltered through 0.2-\u00b5 m-pore-size black polycarbonate membranes (Poretics, Livermore, \n\nCA, USA), and stained with 0.03 % (w/v) acridine orange (Hobbie et al., 1977). Cells \n\nwere counted by epifluorescence microscopy using a Leitz Laborlux K microscope \n\n(Leitz Me?technik, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a I 2/3 filter for blue light. At \n\nleast 200 cells or 20 microscope fields were counted in each of three replicate \n\nmembranes per sample. \n\nCell biovolume was determined on acridine orange-stained preparations by \n\nepifluorescence microscopy by using an ocular grid with black and transparent circles. \n\nFor cell volume calculations, bacteria were assumed to represent cylinders with \n\nhemispherical ends (J\u00fcrgens and Jeppesen, 2000).  \n\n \n\nIrradiation conditions \n\nCells in the different growth conditions were harvested by centrifugation (3,200 \n\nx g for 15 min, Thermo Scientific Heraeus Pico 21 Microcentrifuge, Hamburg, \n\nGermany), washed and resuspended in 0.2-\u00b5 m-pore-size-filtered autoclaved 0.9 % NaCl \n\nsolution and bacterial abundance was adjusted with filtered autoclaved 0.9 % NaCl to \n\n106 cells mL-1.  \n\nCell suspensions (30 mL, corresponding, on average, to a biomass of \n\napproximately 1 mg mL-1 of protein) were transferred to sterile Petri dishes (150 x 25 \n\nmm; Corning) and irradiated (without the lid) under UVB (Philips TL 100 W/01 lamps, \n\nmain emission line of 302 nm). Suspensions were stirred during irradiation using a \n\nmagnetic stirrer. UV sources were placed at 20 cm from the sample. UV intensities were \n\nmeasured with a monochromator spectro-radiometer (DM 300, Bentham Instruments, \n\nReading, UK) placed at the sample level. The UV intensity during irradiations \n\ncorresponded to 2.3 W m-2. The UV dose (in J m-2) was calculated by multiplying the \n\nintensity by the irradiation time (in seconds). A cumulative dose of 60 kJ m-2 was \n\napplied. Aliquots of cell suspensions were collected at pre-determined doses (0, 2, 4, 6, \n\n8, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 kJ m-2) to construct the inactivation curves and for oxidative \n\nstress marker analysis and immediately reserved at 4 \u00baC in order to avoid cell recovery. \n\nDuring irradiation, temperatures were kept at 15 \u00baC or 25 \u00baC, depending on the growth \n\ntemperature of the treatment being considered. Cell homogenates for protein content \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \n\n170 \n\nand protein carbonyl levels analysis were prepared by collecting cells by centrifugation \n\nimmediately after irradiation, resuspending them in cold 50 mM potassium phosphate \n\nbuffer (pH 7.8) containing 1 mM EDTA, followed by sonication in ice (Branson \n\nInstruments Co. Sonifier, Stamford, Conn.; 2 min, 30-s pulses, 1-min cooling). \n\nHomogenates were stored at -80 \u00baC until the measurements. Positive (H2O2-treated) and \n\nnegative (untreated) controls were always included and processed along experimental \n\nsamples in order to ensure proper functioning of the procedures. All experiments were \n\nrepeated in three independent assays and biochemical and microbiological analysis were \n\nalways conducted in triplicate. All the procedures were conducted under low-luminosity \n\nconditions to minimize photoreactivation. All reagents were purchased from Sigma-\n\nAldrich (St Louis, MO), unless otherwise specified. \n\n \n\nColony formation assay \n\nControl and irradiated sample aliquots collected at different UVB doses were \n\nserially-diluted in filter-sterilized, autoclaved 0.9 % NaCl and spread-plated in triplicate \n\nin the solid medium corresponding to the one used to prepare cell suspensions (i.e., \n\neither Tryptic Soy Agar or agarized M9 medium). After 3 days of incubation in the dark \n\nat 15 \u00baC or 25 \u00baC, depending on the treatment, colonies were counted. Survival was \n\ncalculated from the ratio between the number of colony forming units (CFU) after \n\nirradiation and at time zero.  \n\n \n\nDNA strand breakage \n\nDNA strand breaks (DSB) were quantified using a modified version of the \n\nFADU (Fluorimetric Analysis of DNA Unwinding) method, as previously described \n\n(He and H\u00e4der, 2002). The procedure requires two sets of untreated control samples, \n\nbesides test samples (so-called P-samples): samples not subjected to alkaline unwinding \n\n(T-samples) and samples subjected to complete alkaline unwinding (B-samples). \n\nBriefly, cells were collected by centrifugation (3,000 x g, 15 min) and treated with \n\nlysozyme (4 mg mL-1 final concentration) and proteinase K (0.25 mg mL-1 final \n\nconcentration). A volume of 300 \u00b5L of 0.1 M NaOH was then added to the three sets of \n\nsamples: (1) T-samples were immediately neutralized with 300 \u00b5L of 0.1 M HCl, \n\nfollowed by a 30-min incubation at room temperature and sonication for 15 s; (2) B-\n\nsamples were sonicated for 2 min, neutralized with 300 \u00b5L of 0.1 M HCl after a 30-min \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \n\n171 \n\nincubation, and sonicated again for 15 s; and (3) P-samples were incubated for 30 min, \n\nneutralized with 300 \u00b5L of 0.1 M HCl and sonicated for 15 s. \n\nA final concentration of 5 \u00b5 M of Hoechst 33258 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) \n\nwas added to all samples. After centrifugation, the supernatant was used for \n\nfluorescence measurements (?ex. 350 nm; ?em. 450 nm) in a Jasco FP-777 Fluorometer \n\n(Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Data were expressed as the strand \n\nscission factor (SSF), defined as SSF = -ln(Ft/F0), where Ft is the fluorescence of the \n\ntreated sample at time t and F0 is the fluorescence of the sample at time 0 (Baumstark-\n\nKhan and Horneck, 2007).  \n\n \n\nDNA-protein cross-links \n\nDNA-protein cross-links (DPC) were determined as previously described \n\n(Nguyen et al., 2000). Briefly, control and irradiated samples were treated with 1 % \n\nSDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) and 1 M NaCl. After vigorous vortexing, two volumes of \n\nchloroform:isopentyl alcohol (24:1) were added and the mixture was vortexed again. \n\nAfter centrifugation at 6,000 x g for 15 min, the absorbance at 260 nm of the aqueous \n\nphase was read in a Thermo Spectronic Genesys 10 UV spectrophotometer (Thermo \n\nFisher Scientific SL, Alcobendas, Spain). The fraction of DNA-protein cross-linking \n\nwas determined according to the equation: \n\nFraction cross-linked = (A0 - At)/A0 \n\nwhere A0 is the absorbance of sample at time 0 and At is the absorbance of the treated \n\nsamples at time t. \n\n \n\nLipid peroxidation \n\nLipid peroxidation was determined as the amount of thiobarbituric acid reactive \n\nsubstances (TBARS), as previously described (P\u00e9rez et al., 2007). Control and \n\nirradiated cells were centrifuged, washed, and suspended in 1 mL of 50 mM potassium \n\nphosphate buffer (pH 7.4). A final concentration of 0.1 mM butylated hydroxytoluene \n\nand 1 mM PMSF (phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) was added to prevent further lipid \n\noxidation. After sonication and centrifugation, the soluble fraction was mixed with 1 \n\nmL of 20 % trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 5 min. The \n\nsupernatant was removed and mixed with 1 mL of 0.5 % (w/v) thiobarbituric acid in 0.1 \n\nM HCl and 10 mM butylated hydroxytoluene in a new tube. After heating at 100 \u00baC for \n\n1 h, 1 mL aliquots were removed, cooled at room temperature and then mixed with 1.5 \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \n\n172 \n\nmL of butanol. After centrifugation (4,000 x g, 10 min), the absorbance at 535 nm of the \n\norganic fraction was read in a Thermo Spectronic Genesys 10 UV spectrophotometer \n\n(Thermo Fisher Scientific SL, Alcobendas, Spain). TBARS content was determined \n\nusing an extinction coefficient of 156 mM-1cm-1. Results were expressed per mg of \n\nprotein. \n\n \n\nProtein oxidation  \n\nThe carbonyl content in oxidized proteins was determined as previously \n\ndescribed (Semchyshyn et al., 2005). Aliquots of homogenates were mixed with 10 mM \n\ndinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) in 2 M HCl. DNPH was omitted in the blanks. After \n\nincubation at room temperature for 1 hour, proteins were precipitated with 500 \u00b5 L of 20 \n\n% trichloroacetic acid. The mixture was centrifuged (14,000 x g, 5 min), and the pellet \n\nwas washed three times with 1 mL of 1:1 (vol/vol) ethanol-ethyl acetate. The final \n\nprecipitate was dissolved in 1 mL of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. The absorbance at \n\n360 nm was determined, using guanidine solution (6 M guanidine hydrochloride with 2 \n\nmM potassium phosphate) as a blank. A molar absorption coefficient of 22 mM-1cm-1 \n\nwas used to quantify the levels of protein carbonyls. Results were expressed per mg of \n\nprotein. \n\n \n\nProtein concentration \n\nProtein concentration in cell homogenates was determined by the Bradford \n\nmethod using BSA as a standard (Bradford, 1976).  \n\n \n\nStatistical analysis \n\nPrior to statistical analysis, data normality was tested by the Kolmogorov-\n\nSmirnov test. Differences between treatments were assessed by 1-way ANOVA using \n\nthe statistical software SPSS v.17. Levene test was used to assess homogeneity of \n\nvariances. If variances were not homogeneous, the natural logarithm transformation was \n\napplied. If variances were still not homogenous, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test \n\nwas used to assess the overall effect of the treatment (Sokal and Rolf, 1995).  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \n\n173 \n\nResults \n\nInitial characterization of cell suspensions \n\nThe growth curve of Pseudomonas sp. strain NT5I1.2B under different \n\nconditions is presented in Fig. 10.1. Table 10.1 summarizes the characteristics of the \n\ncell suspensions used in the subsequent irradiation assays. Mid-exponential phase, late-\n\nexponential phase and stationary phase were achieved in 4-12 h, 6-14 h and 12-18 h, \n\nrespectively. Total bacterial abundance, determined by epifluorescence microscopy, \n\nranged between 5.2 x 107 and 1.4 x 109 cells mL-1 in mid-exponential phase, between \n\n6.4 x 107 and 1.8 x 109 cells mL-1 in late-exponential phase and 6.6 x 107 and 2.0 x 109 \n\ncells mL-1 in the stationary phase. These results were consistent with CFU \n\ndeterminations (data not shown), suggesting that cells remained culturable under all \n\ngrowth conditions tested. Cell biovolume varied between 0.192-0.360 \u00b5 m3 in the mid-\n\nexponential phase, 0.390-0.740 \u00b5 m3 in the late-exponential phase and 0.529-1.266 \u00b5 m3 \n\nin the stationary phase. \n\n  \nFig. 10.1.

Dark controls were always \n\nperformed for every growth condition tested and did not vary significantly (1-way \n\nANOVA, p > 0.05) throughout the duration of the corresponding irradiation period. \n\nTherefore, only a representative dark control is shown in Fig. 10.2. The survival of \n\nPseudomonas sp. in the mid-exponential phase grown in different media and at different \n\ntemperatures followed a general dose-dependent variation. The percentage of cell \n\nsurvival at 60 kJ m-2 ranged between 1.8 and 11.7 % (Fig. 10.2 A). Late-exponential \n\nphase cells grown in TSB at 15 \u00baC and in M9 at 25 \u00baC showed a linear decrease in cell \n\nsurvival up to a cumulative dose of 10 kJ m-2, after which cell survival stabilized. Cells \n\ngrown in M9 at 15 \u00baC displayed a linear decrease in survival up to a cumulative dose of \n\n40 kJ m-2 and stabilized thereafter. For cells grown in TSB at 25 \u00baC, survival decreased \n\nprogressively up to the end of the irradiation period. The percentage of cell survival at \n\n60 kJ m-2 varied between 18.4 and 52.2 % (Fig. 10.2 B).  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 10.2. UVB survival curves of Pseudomonas sp.

Absence of error bars indicates that standard deviations are too small to see on the scale used. \n\n \n\nStationary phase cells grown in M9 at 15 \u00baC showed a progressive decrease in \n\ncell survival up to a cumulative dose of 50 kJ m-2.

Cell survival at 60 kJ m-2 ranged between 24.6 and \n\n59.1 % (Fig. 10.2 C). \n\nIn late-exponential and stationary phase cells, TBARS levels varied in a dose-\n\ndependent pattern up to a cumulative UVB dose of 10 kJ m-2. In general, TBARS levels \n\npeaked at 19.4-52.5 pmol/ mg of protein upon exposure to low UVB doses (2-10 kJ m-\n\n2), showing different trends of variation in the period thereafter (Fig. 10.3 A-C). \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 10.3.

Absence of error bars indicates that standard deviations are too small to see on the scale used. \n\n \n\nDNA strand breaks, expressed as SSF (strand scission factor), increased in a \n\ngeneral dose-dependent fashion up to 10 kJ m-2 in all treatments. In mid-exponential \n\nphase cells, SSF peaked at 0.2-0.8 after 40 kJ m-2, varying thereafter (Fig. 10.4 A). SSF \n\nin late-exponential and stationary phase cells oscillated strongly at UVB doses over 10 \n\nkJ m-2, peaking at 0.3-0.8 between 30-60 kJ m-2 (Fig. 10.4 B, 10.4 C). \n\nThe levels of DNA-protein cross-links (DPC) also showed a general dose-\n\ndependent variation up to 10 kJ m-2 of UVB. For mid-exponential phase cells, DPC \n\nlevels peaked at 0.3 after 10 kJ m-2 for cells grown in TSB at 15 \u00baC, and at 0.3-0.5 after \n\na cumulative dose of 60 kJ m-2 for the remaining treatments (Fig. 10.5 A).

Absence of error bars indicates that standard deviations are too small to see on the scale used. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \n\n179 \n\nInfluence of growth medium \n\n For mid- and late-exponential phase cells grown at 15 \u00baC, survival at low UVB \n\ndoses (? 20 kJ m-2) was generally enhanced when cells were cultivated in M9 than in \n\nTSB by as much as 2.5-fold (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05). At higher UVB doses, this \n\ntrend was inverted, with cells grown in TSB surviving up to 5.4 times better than those \n\ngrown in M9. For cells grown at 25 \u00baC, survival was generally higher in TSB than in \n\nM9 by as much as 2.2-fold (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05) (Fig. 10.2 A, 10.2 B). In \n\nstationary phase cells, survival was either enhanced in TSB (by up to 1.8-fold) or not \n\nsignificantly different between growth media (Fig. 10.2 C). \n\nFor cells grown at 15 \u00baC in the mid-exponential phase, TBARS levels were up to \n\n19.6 times higher in M9 than in TSB (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05) (Fig. 10.3 A). For cells \n\nin the late-exponential and stationary phases, TBARS were either enhanced in M9 or \n\nTSB depending on the growth temperature (Fig. 10.3 B, 10.3 C). \n\nMid-exponential phase cells grown at 15 \u00baC in M9 showed up to 3 times more \n\nlevels of DSB than when grown in TSB (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05) (Fig. 10.4 A). In the \n\nremaining treatments, DSB levels were generally enhanced when cells were grown in \n\nTSB, by up to 16.8-fold, particularly for medium-high UVB doses (? 10 kJ m-2) (1-way \n\nANOVA, p &lt;0.05) (Fig. 10.4 A-C). DPC levels were either enhanced in M9 or TSB \n\ndepending on the growth temperature and growth phase (Fig. 10.5). \n\nIn mid-exponential phase cells, at low UVB doses (? 10 kJ m-2) carbonyl levels \n\nwere enhanced in M9, by up to 7-fold (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05) (Fig. 10.6 A). In late-\n\nexponential and stationary phase cells, carbonyls levels were generally enhanced in \n\nTSB, particularly at medium-high UVB doses (> 10 kJ m-2), by as much as 5.3 fold (1-\n\nway ANOVA, p &lt;0.05) (Fig. 10.6 B, 10.6 C). \n\n \n\nDiscussion \n\nOxidative damage is an important component of the mechanism of action of \n\nUVB radiation in bacteria, as denoted by the rapid induction of oxidative stress defences \n\nfollowing irradiation (Qiu et al., 2005a; Matallana-Surget et al., 2009a; Matallana-\n\nSurget et al., 2012). The present work investigated the influence of the light dose and \n\ngrowth conditions (growth phase, growth temperature, and growth medium) on the \n\noxidative damage elicited by exposure to UVB radiation in a bacterial isolate \n\nrepresentative of Gammaproteobacteria, which have been found to dominate sunlit \n\nsurface waters and proposed to be UV-resistant (Franklin et al., 2005; Alonso-S\u00e1ez et \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \n\n180 \n\nal., 2006; Santos et al., 2012b). The Pseudomonas strain used in the present study is \n\naffiliated with P. putida, which accumulates only low levels of DNA damage following \n\nUVB exposure and shows low repair capabilities (Fern\u00e1ndez Zenoff et al., 2006b). \n\nCertain P. putida members also contain a plasmid (pWW0), which encodes an error-\n\nprone DNA polymerase involved in mutagenic DNA repair, that confers evolutionary \n\nfitness to plasmid-carrying strains upon exposure to UV radiation (Tark et al., 2005). \n\n \n\nUVB dose-dependence of cellular damage \n\nThe markers of cellular damage used in the present study (lipid oxidation, \n\nprotein carbonylation, and DNA damage) varied in a general dose-dependent manner \n\nfor low UVB doses (? 10 kJ m-2). Frequently, maximum levels of oxidative stress \n\nmarkers were observed in this period, particularly in mid-exponential phase cells. For \n\nhigher UVB doses, the levels of oxidative stress markers either stabilized or oscillated, \n\nsuggesting that oxidative damage is eventually compensated by the appropriate repair \n\nmechanisms. The alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC) protein plays an important role \n\nin the reduction of organic hydroperoxides and in the defence against sulphur-\n\ncontaining radicals (Poole, 2005), and has been proposed to be involved in the \n\nprotection against lipid peroxidation (Mishra et al., 2009). Enhanced levels of the AhpC \n\nprotein have been shown in UVB-irradiated Photobacterium angustum S14 (Matallana-\n\nSurget et al., 2012). Since protein carbonylation is an irreversible process, variation in \n\nthe levels of protein carbonyls during the course of irradiation may reflect enhanced \n\nactivity of proteases involved in the degradation of carbonylated proteins, including \n\nDnaK, GroEL, and Clp (Fredriksson et al., 2005). Accordingly, the abundance of these \n\nproteins has been shown to increase in response to UV exposure (Matallana-Surget et \n\nal., 2009a).  \n\nAlternatively, there can be a saturation of oxidative damage in the cell, \n\npotentially associated with the formation of multiple lesions as a result of consecutive \n\nmolecule excitation by high UV doses, resulting in a complex, non-linear dependence of \n\noxidative damage on the irradiation dose (Byeong et al., 2007). Further studies, \n\npotentially using more powerful and sensitive techniques (e.g., mass spectrometry-based \n\nassessment of quantitative and qualitative changes in proteins and lipids during \n\nirradiation) are necessary to elucidate the lack of a dose-dependence in oxidative stress \n\nmarkers at high UVB doses. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \n\n181 \n\nInfluence of growth phase \n\nIn general, survival upon UVB exposure was highest in stationary phase cells. \n\nEnhanced survival of stationary phase cells was also associated with lower levels of \n\nDNA-protein cross-links and protein carbonyls, compared to exponential phase cells. \n\nSeveral studies have suggested that cells with reduced specific growth rates, such as \n\nstationary phase cells, are more resistant than exponential phase cells to multiple \n\nstresses, including extremes of temperature and osmolarity, oxidative stress, UV and \n\ngamma irradiation, iron and copper toxicity, as well as acid and base shock (Nair and \n\nFinkel, 2004). Enhanced survival during the stationary phase has been attributed to the \n\nexpression of different biosynthetic pathways, gene regulators, and enzyme systems that \n\nconfer an adaptive advantage to cells in the stationary phase (Rees, 1995; Dodd et al., \n\n1997). The alternative sigma factor RpoS or ?38 encoded by the rpoS gene, plays a \n\ncritical role in stress resistance of stationary phase cells by regulating the expression of \n\nantioxidant enzymes, particularly catalase (Hengge-Aronis, 1999; Oppezzo et al., 2011).  \n\nMid-exponential phase cells were the least resistant to irradiation, displaying \n\nhigh levels of protein carbonyls, especially at low UVB doses (? 10 kJ m-2). An \n\nintrinsically weaker oxidative stress defence stock (Eisenstark et al., 1996) coupled with \n\nenhanced ROS production associated with high aerobic respiration rates of mid-\n\nexponential phase cells (Nystr\u00f6m, 2004) and small size (Garcia-Pichel, 1994), \n\npotentially contributed to the high sensitivity of mid-exponential phase cells to UVB \n\nradiation. \n\n \n\nInfluence of growth temperature \n\nMid-exponential phase cells grown at 15 \u00baC showed greater survival after UVB \n\nexposure than cells grown at 25 \u00baC, particularly at low UVB doses. The levels of DNA \n\nstrand breaks were higher in cells grown at 25\u00ba C than at 15 \u00baC in all treatments, which \n\nwas also accompanied by enhanced levels of lipid peroxidation in mid-exponential \n\nphase cells. These results are consistent with previous studies documenting a higher \n\nyield of UV-induced DNA damage at higher temperature (24 \u00b0C versus 12 \u00b0C) in \n\nSphingopyxis alaskensis (Matallana-Surget et al., 2010), thus suggesting that the \n\nformation of DNA lesions during UV exposure is temperature-dependent. The \n\ntemperature dependence of DNA damage has been attributed to a possible influence of \n\ntemperature on the conformational state of DNA (Li et al., 2002) and/or an indirect \n\neffect on DNA by affecting DNA-binding proteins (Matallana-Surget et al., 2010).  \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \n\n182 \n\nThe reactions involved in the interaction of ROS and their targets might also be \n\ntemperature-dependent (Li et al., 2002). The electron transport chain is a key source of \n\nROS in the cell (Imlay and Fridovich, 1991; Gonz\u00e1lez-Flecha and Demple, 1995). \n\nLower temperatures could have reduced oxygen consumption rates, particularly in the \n\nhighly active mid-exponential phase cells, which in turn reduced the rates of normal \n\nROS production and the risk of oxidative damage. On the other hand, low temperature \n\ncan also modify the metabolic status of the cell, increasing the efficiency of damage \n\nrepair and/or production of antioxidants (Borgeraas and Hessen, 2000).  \n\nHowever, in stationary phase cells, particularly at high UVB doses, the trend \n\nobserved for mid-exponential phase cells was inverted, with cells grown at 25 \u00baC \n\nsurviving better and showing lower levels of oxidative stress markers. One possibility to \n\naccount for this observation is that in stationary phase cells, in which there is a lower \n\noxidative burden associated with respiration (Nystr\u00f6m, 2004), enhanced temperature \n\nmight stimulate the enzymatic processes involved in defence against UV-induced \n\nlesions (e.g., the activity of antioxidant enzymes) (Bullock and Jeffrey, 2010). \n\nAdditionally, enhanced cell size, by providing higher internal self-shading (Garcia-\n\nPichel, 1994) could have also contributed for enhanced survival during UVB exposure.  \n\n \n\nInfluence of the growth medium \n\nCells cultivated in nutrient-rich TSB generally survived better to medium-high \n\nUVB doses (> 10 kJ m-2) than those grown in nutrient-poor M9 medium. These results \n\nare consistent with the enhanced sensitivity of a set of bacterial isolates exposed to 60 \n\nkJ m-2 of UVB radiation under nutrient depleted conditions, compared to nourished \n\ncounterparts (Santos et al., 2012a). Nutrient-rich TSB, but not M9, could possibly have \n\nprovided sufficient amounts of the chemical elements required for the synthesis of \n\nmacromolecules necessary to withstand high UVB doses (e.g., enzymes involved in \n\nDNA repair and ROS scavenging), thus accounting for the enhanced UVB resistance of \n\ncells grown in TSB. Accordingly, supply with high nutrient concentrations (nitrogen \n\nand phosphorus) has been found to result in reduced UV-sensitivity and enhanced repair \n\ncapabilities in bacterioplankton, compared to the amendment with lower nutrient \n\nconcentrations (Pausz and Herndl, 2002; Joux et al., 2009).  \n\nHowever, it is possible that the higher rates of macromolecule synthesis in cells \n\ngrown in TSB could carry an increased risk of oxidative damage to the cells, as \n\nindicated by the generally enhanced levels of oxidative stress markers during irradiation \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \n\n183 \n\nin cells grown in nutrient-rich media, compared to cells grown in M9. It is known that \n\nthe composition of the growth medium affects the lipid composition of the bacterial cell, \n\nand this can in turn affect susceptibility to oxidative stress. For instance, supplementing \n\nthe bacterial growth medium with free polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is known to \n\nresult in enhanced incorporation of a given PUFA into bacterial fatty acids (Kankaanp\u00e4\u00e4 \n\net al., 2004) which are the main targets of peroxidation (Imlay, 2003). Further studies \n\nare necessary to elucidate the role of the growth medium in bacterial cell composition \n\nand in the subsequent sensitivity to UVB-induced stress. \n\n \n\nImportance of growth conditions for UVB-induced damage \n\n Most studies reporting UVB effects on bacterial isolates have typically \n\nconsidered cells in the mid-exponential and late-exponential phase (Joux et al., 1999; \n\nArrieta et al., 2000; Qiu et al., 2004; Agogu\u00e9 et al., 2005; Fern\u00e1ndez Zenoff et al., \n\n2006b; H\u00f6rtnagl et al., 2011; Santos et al., 2011b; Santos et al., 2012a). The results \n\nobtained in the present study indicate that the growth phase, growth temperature, and \n\ngrowth medium of bacteria influence their levels of oxidative damage during UVB \n\nexposure, thus highlighting the importance of the growth conditions of bacteria in \n\ndetermining their responses to UVB exposure. This is in accordance with previous \n\nstudies conducted with Escherichia coli exposed to different UV wavelengths (Berney \n\net al., 2006c; Bucheli-Witschel et al., 2010). These results also highlight the difficulties \n\nin understanding UV-bacteria interaction in natural bacterial communities and the \n\nlimitations of extrapolating results from laboratorial experiments with bacterial isolates \n\nto the environment. \n\nThe temporal variation in survival and oxidative damage to different \n\nbiomolecules is illustrated in the representative conceptual graphs shown in Fig. 10.7 \n\nfor the interval corresponding to 0-10 kJ m-2, in which survival was dose-dependent in \n\nall treatments. Growth conditions preceding irradiation might influence bacterial \n\nsensitivity to UVB radiation potentially by affecting the temporal progression of \n\nbiomolecule damage. For instance, cells in the mid-exponential phase displayed a strong \n\nincrease in TBARS levels with irradiation, which preceded damage to the other \n\nmolecules (Fig. 10.7). This observation suggests an important role of lipid damage in \n\ndetermining the reduction of cell survival during the very early stages of UVB exposure. \n\nThere is increasing experimental evidence suggesting that lipid peroxidation is \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \n\n184 \n\nphysiologically important in microorganisms (Semchyshyn et al., 2005; P\u00e9rez et al., \n\n2007; P\u00e9rez et al., 2008).  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nFig. 10.7. Graphical representation of the temporal variation of survival and markers of oxidative stress in Pseudomonas sp. \n\nNT5I1.2B upon exposure to low UVB doses (0-10 kJ m-2). Late-exponential and stationary phase cells followed a broad similar \n\npattern of variation. Therefore only the temporal variation of stationary phase cells is shown. \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \n\n185 \n\nThe observed importance of lipid damage in UVB-induced inactivation is \n\nconsistent with recent results obtained for a set of bacterial isolates (Santos et al., 2013), \n\nand the strong induction of the AhpC protein, involved in the defence of the cell against \n\nlipid peroxidation, in UVB-irradiated Photobacterium angustum S14 (Matallana-Surget \n\net al., 2012).  \n\nIn late-exponential and stationary phase cells, DNA damage (DNA strand breaks \n\nand DNA-protein cross-links) seems to play a more determinant role in the reduction of \n\ncell survival, generally preceding damage to lipids and proteins (Fig. 10.7). The growth \n\ntemperature and medium might affect UVB sensitivity by strongly influencing the \n\nmagnitude of the damage to particular biomolecules. \n\nThese results indicate that the variability of the effects associated with the \n\ndifferent growth conditions must be considered for an in-depth understanding of the \n\nmechanisms of UVB-induced damage in bacteria. In order to gain environmentally \n\nrelevant information from laboratorial studies with isolated bacteria, the growth \n\nconditions of those bacteria should be as similar as possible to the ones observed in the \n\nnatural environment. \n\n \n\nConclusions \n\nIn general, a linear dose-dependent variation of oxidative damage parameters \n\nupon exposure to UVB was observed for low doses (0-10 kJ m-2) only, suggesting the \n\noccurrence of a dynamic process between damage induction and repair and/or potential \n\nsaturation of oxidative damage at high UVB doses. Stationary phase cells were the most \n\nresistant to UVB radiation, and mid-exponential phase cells were the least resistant. \n\nDifferences in UVB sensitivity between growth phases were mostly associated with the \n\nextent of protein carbonylation and DNA-protein cross-links. In mid-exponential phase \n\ncells, oxidative damage was generally higher at 25 \u00baC than at 15 \u00baC, suggesting a \n\ntemperature dependence of ROS generation and/or ROS interaction with cellular targets \n\nat low UVB doses. At high UVB doses, survival was enhanced in cells grown in TSB \n\nthan in M9. Growth conditions preceding irradiation are important determinants of \n\nsurvival and oxidative damage imposed by UVB exposure, potentially by affecting the \n\ntemporal progression and the magnitude of the biomolecular damage. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \n\n186 \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nAcknowledgments are due to Susana Machado, In\u00eas Baptista and Silvia F.

L., Henriques I., Moura A., Jov\u00e9 T., Cunha A., Correia A. \n\nManuscript in preparation \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nThe RecA protein plays a crucial role in the processes of homologous \n\nrecombination and in the bacterial SOS response elicited by exposure to DNA damaging \n\nagents. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that the importance of recombination and \n\nability to cope with DNA damage during the life history of microorganisms could be \n\nreflected in RecA phylogeny and frequency in the genome. \n\nIn the present work, the diversity of recA genes among completely sequenced \n\nbacterial genomes was studied. Additionally, recA and 16S rRNA gene trees of \n\nGammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria and Firmicutes were constructed and \n\ncompared. The presence of multiple recA copies in sequenced genomes and the \n\nfrequency of plasmid-encoded recA genes were also examined. \n\nRecA was confirmed to be absent only in bacterial endosymbionts. Phylogenetic \n\nanalysis of the RecA protein was, in general, coherent with the phyla defined by 16S \n\nrRNA gene analysis. recA gene trees of Deltaproteobacteria and Firmicutes were in \n\ngeneral agreement with 16S rRNA trees, but were more divergent in \n\nGammaproteobacteria. Duplication of the recA gene was found to be widespread in \n\nmyxobacteria, and also frequent among Firmicutes. Putative recA paralogs, resulting \n\nfrom a recent duplication event, were identified in some genomes. In other cases, \n\ndivergent genomic G+C content suggests that this extra copy of recA could have arisen \n\nthrough horizontal gene transfer. The presence of recA homologs in plasmids and, in \n\nsome cases, in the vicinity of transposase genes supports the possibility of plasmid or \n\ntransposon-mediated mobility of the recA gene. We suggest that these plasmid-encoded \n\nrecA genes could complement the activity of one or several of the chromosome-encoded \n\nrecA genes in the bacterial SOS response. \n\n\n\nChapter 11 \n\n188 \n\nIntroduction \n\nExposure to DNA damaging agents can cause halting of bacterial replication \n\nforks at sites of DNA lesions. Rescue of stalled DNA replication forks is mediated by \n\nhomologous recombination, a process which is critical for genomic stability and cellular \n\nviability, contributing also for the generation of genetic diversity (Cox, 2007). The \n\nmultifunctional RecA protein is the central factor in homologous recombination and \n\nrecombinational DNA repair. In this process, RecA binds stretches of single-stranded \n\nDNA, unwinds duplex DNA, finds regions of homology between chromosomes and \n\nthen promotes strand invasion and exchange between homologous DNA molecules. \n\nRecA also has a regulatory role in the induction of the SOS response involved in DNA \n\nrepair through its co-protease activity, responsible for inducing the autocatalytic \n\ncleavage of the LexA repressor which initiates the expression of several DNA repair \n\ngenes (Radman, 1975). Additionally, the RecA co-protease activity facilitates the \n\nactivation of UmuD, a component of the error-prone DNA polymerase V that mediates \n\nreplicative bypass of DNA lesions during the SOS response (Schlacher and Goodman, \n\n2007). Another catalytic activity of RecA is the self-cleavage of bacteriophage \n\nrepressors, like CI from lambda, inducing the shift from lysogeny to lytic growth \n\n(Galkin et al., 2009). Recently, disruption of the recA gene in Acinetobacter revealed a \n\npleiotropic effect on phenotypes like antibiotic resistance, virulence and heat-shock and \n\noxidative stress responses (Aranda et al., 2011).  \n\nThe RecA activity is found in virtually all bacteria, with the exception of \n\nobligate intracellular symbionts that have undergone dramatic genome size reductions, \n\nwhich adopt alternative strategies for sustainable DNA replication and repair (Sharples, \n\n2009). The wide distribution of bacterial recA genes, in phylogenetic groups that took \n\nseparate evolutionary paths during Precambrian times, including Bacteria, Archaea and \n\nEukarya, indicates that the RecA protein ancestor preceded the separation of the three \n\nmajor biological domains (Roca and Cox, 1990). Based on studies of the RecA of \n\nEscherichia coli, the protein (352 aa) is generally divided into three domains (Bianco et \n\nal., 1998): an N-terminal domain (aa 1-33), involved in filament formation; the central \n\n\u2018core\u2019 region (aa 33-240), which contains the residues involved in ATP binding; and the \n\nC-terminal domain (aa 241-352) which is involved in the DNA strand exchange reaction \n\n(Lusetti et al., 2003). At the amino acid level, the degree of conservation stretches \n\nbasically across the entire sequence with the exception of the highly acidic C-terminus, \n\nless conserved. The near universality and degree of conservation of the recA gene has \n\n\n\nChapter 11 \n\n189 \n\nmade it a potentially useful tool for molecular systematic studies of bacteria (Eisen, \n\n1995; Ludwig and Klenk, 2001; Zeigler, 2003) and has been proposed as an alternative \n\nphylogenetic marker to 16S rRNA genes in several bacterial groups (Van Waasbergen \n\net al., 2000; Torriani et al., 2001; Thompson et al., 2004; Payne et al., 2005; Scholz et \n\nal., 2008; Sepe et al., 2008; Weng et al., 2009; Costechareyre et al., 2010; Landeta et al., \n\n2011). \n\nEvidences suggest that structural or kinetic properties of RecA are related to \n\nspecific requirements of DNA damage repair systems in some species. For example, \n\nalthough the overall fold of the RecA of the radiation-resistant Deinococcus \n\nradiodurans is similar to that of E. coli, there is a large reorientation of the C-terminal \n\ndomain involved in binding dsDNA. Additionally, it displays unique amino acid \n\nresidues around a flexible ?-hairpin that is implicated in DNA binding (Rajan and Bell, \n\n2004). \n\nMost known bacterial species possess only one recA. The presence of two recA \n\ngenes has been documented in Bacillus megaterium (Nahrstedt et al., 2005) and \n\nMyxococcus xanthus (Norioka et al., 1995). Acaryochloris marina MBIC11017 seems \n\nto possess seven copies of this gene, four of which located in four out of its nine \n\nplasmids (Swingley et al., 2008). A recA gene homolog is also present on a 65 kb \n\nconjugative lactococcal plasmid (Garvey et al., 1997) and on a 53 kb plasmid from an \n\nenvironmental Vibrio strain (Hazen et al., 2007). More recently, the presence of two \n\nrecA (recAP1 and recAP3) in two different plasmids in Deinococcus deserti in addition to \n\nthe chromosomal recA was also reported (Dulermo et al., 2009). The authors proposed \n\nthat the extra recAP1 and recAP3 genes may provide higher levels of RecA protein for \n\nefficient error-free repair of DNA damage.  \n\nWith the increasing number of bacterial genomes available in public databases, \n\nopportunities for more extensive analyses and contextualization of genes and proteins \n\namong complete sequenced organisms arise. The aims of this study were: (1) to inspect \n\nthe presence of recA genes in sequenced bacterial genomes, including \n\nextrachromosomal replicons; (2) to evaluate the performance of the recA gene and \n\ndeduced amino acid sequence as phylogenetic markers and (3) to search for evidences \n\nof events contributing for genome evolution, such as duplication or lateral transfer of \n\nrecA genes.  \n\n\n\nChapter 11 \n\n190 \n\nMaterials and methods \n\nData retrieval \n\nThe recA nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acid sequences within fully \n\nsequenced bacterial genomes were retrieved from GenBank NRAA database \n\n(ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db/FASTA/nr.gz) and manually inspected for the presence \n\nof sequences annotated as \u201crecA\u201d, \u201crecombination protein A\u201d or \u201crecombinase A\u201d. For \n\nthe genomes where such annotation could not be found, the presence of recA homologs \n\nwas inferred by searching for sequences with high similarity to the recA gene of E. coli \n\nusing BLASTN (E value = 0.0). To search for homologs of the recA gene in plasmids, \n\nall the retrieved sequences were used as queries in BLASTN, TBLASTN, and PSI-\n\nBLAST searches. Genes wrongly annotated as recA that displayed no similarity with \n\nrecA homologs were excluded from the analysis (supplementary material in Appendix). \n\nG+C contents of genomes and recA genes were estimated based on nucleotide \n\nsequences retrieved from KEGG database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) (Kanehisa, \n\n2002) using locally developed Perl scripts. The genomic context of recA genes was \n\nmanually retrieved from the GenBank database. \n\n \n\nPhylogenetic analyses \n\nTo study the evolution of the RecA protein, phylogenetic trees using the amino \n\nacid sequence of the most conserved core region of RecA (aa 33-240 in E. coli) were \n\nconstructed. DMC1 (Homo sapiens and Danio rerio), Rad51 (Drosophila simulans and \n\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae) and RadA (Pyrococcus abyssi) sequences (homologous of \n\nthe bacterial RecA) were included in the phylogenetic tree as outgroups. Preliminary \n\nmultiple sequence alignments were carried out with CLUSTALX 1.8 (Thompson et al., \n\n1997). Preliminary Neighbour-Joining (NJ) trees were then generated using MEGA 3.0. \n\nTo reduce the complexity of the phylogenetic tree, one representative sequence was \n\nchosen for closely related branches (diverging by less than 4 %). Each representative \n\nsequence was aligned again separately and then combined by using profile alignment in \n\nCLUSTALX. Different tree construction methods (Neighbour-Joining, Minimum \n\nEvolution and Maximum Parsimony) were compared and yielded similar results. The \n\nfinal Neighbour-Joining tree was constructed with MEGA 3.0 using the pairwise gap \n\ndeletion option, Poisson correction as distance measure and 1000 bootstrap replicates.  \n\nTo address the congruence between the phylogenetic information provided by \n\nrecA and 16S rRNA nucleotide sequences, alignments of the corresponding genes were \n\n\n\nChapter 11 \n\n191 \n\nproduced using MEGA 3.0 with the pairwise gap deletion option. Phylogenies for \n\nspecific bacterial groups (Deltaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes) \n\nwere reconstructed using the Neighbour-Joining method and distances estimated using \n\nthe Jukes-Cantor model with 1000 bootstrap replicates. \n\n \n\nResults and discussion \n\nDistribution of the recA gene in sequenced bacterial genomes  \n\nFig. 11.1 shows the distribution by phylum of the 1076 genomes considered in \n\nthe present study. Sequences belonging to Proteobacteria (41.7 %), Firmicutes (24.4 %), \n\nActinobacteria (12.5 %) and Bacteroidetes (8.9 %) were the most represented in the \n\ndatabase. The presence of the recA gene was detected in all the analyzed genomes, \n\nexcept those of the endosymbionts Candidatus Hodgkinia cicadicola \n\n(Alphaproteobacteria), Candidatus Sulcia muelleri (Bacteroidetes), Buchnera \n\naphidicola (Gammaproteobacteria), species belonging to the Candidatus Blochmannia \n\ngenus (Gammaproteobacteria), Candidatus Ruthia magnifica (Gammaproteobacteria), \n\nCandidatus Vesicomyosocius okutanii (Gammaproteobacteria) and phytoplasmas \n\n(Mollicutes). In these cases, the absence of recombination confers genetic stability to \n\nthe mutualistic bacteria by precluding the occurrence of genetic rearrangements and \n\nlateral gene transfer (Sharples, 2009). \n\n \n\nFig. 11.1. Relative distribution of recA sequences considered in this study by phylum. The relative frequency of each bacterial \n\nphylum in the total sequenced bacterial genomes is presented in brackets. \n\n \n\nIn general, the recA genes analyzed contained 888 to 1341 nucleotides. On \n\nseveral genomes, smaller or larger sequences annotated as recA were also found. These \n\n\n\nChapter 11 \n\n192 \n\nsmaller sequences frequently corresponded to the C- or N- terminal regions of the RecA \n\nprotein annotated separately and, in some cases, interrupted by introns or intein-coding \n\nsequences (Table 11.1). In other cases, longer recA gene sequences were also detected, \n\nthat were subsequently found to contain introns or inteins. Introns are non-coding \n\nsequences located within genes that are transcribed but not translated into proteins, \n\nbeing removed by self-splicing whereby the intron catalyzes its own removal from the \n\ngene and the joining of coding sequences (exons) (Haugen et al., 2005). Inteins are \n\nprotein intervening sequences that are able to cleave themselves from a precursor \n\nprotein while joining the flanking sequences (Boles and Horswill, 2008). \n\nAs the result of the presence of intein-coding sequences, longer recA genes were \n\nidentified in a plasmid of E. coli (779 aa), several mycobacterium species (up to 790 aa) \n\nand in the soil-living actinomycete Thermobifida fusca (1172 aa, two inteins) (Table \n\n11.1). The presence of RecA inteins in the obligate intracellular mycobacterial \n\npathogens have led to the hypothesis that these inteins might play a role in \n\nmycobacterial functions related to pathogenesis or virulence (Davis et al., 1994). In M. \n\ntuberculosis and M. leprae the RecA intein contains a catalytically active homing \n\nendonuclease domain which determines an endonuclease that promotes the spreading of \n\nthe intein (Haugen et al., 2005). In the present work, the presence of a sequence \n\nencoding a homing endonuclease motif associated with an intein was also detected in \n\nthe recA genes of the deep-sea actinomycete Verrucosispora maris and the thermophilic \n\nactinomycete Thermomonospora curvata, suggesting a recent spread of recA inteins \n\namong Actinomycetales. \n\nIn several strains of Bacillus sp. and Geobacillus sp. the recA gene was also \n\nfound to be interrupted by group I or group II introns (Table 11.1), which differ by their \n\nsplicing mechanism (Haugen et al., 2005). Intein-coding sequences and introns in the \n\nrecA of mycobacteria and Bacillus species have been proposed to be evolutionary \n\nrelated (Ko et al., 2002), though an endonuclease activity has not been found in the recA \n\nintrons of Bacillus sp. (Nord et al., 2007). In B. anthracis the presence of an intron does \n\nnot affect RecA activity nor the expression, pathogenicity, or the survival of the host \n\norganism (Ko et al., 2002). In Geobacillus kaustophilus the presence of the recA intron \n\ndoes not affect UV sensitivity (Chee and Takami, 2005). These observations suggest \n\nthat the current function of recA intron seems dispensable (Ko et al., 2002), indicating \n\nthat the spread of recA introns could have occurred through neutral evolution. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 11 \n\n193 \n\nTable 11.1. recA genes containing introns or inteins. \n\nOrganism Accession no.

Labels and colour shadings are used to put in evidence \n\ncommonly used subdivisions. \n\n\n\nChapter 11 \n\n195 \n\nRecA is a potential phylogenetic marker \n\nTo construct the phylogenetic tree of RecA, only sequences within the range \n\nbetween 296 and 447 amino acids were used. Analysis of the phylogenetic tree of RecA \n\nprotein revealed the early divergence of sequences from Tenericutes from the remaining \n\nbacterial phyla (Fig. 11.2). Such observation is in accordance with previous work \n\n(Dybvig et al., 1992), and probably results from the rapid evolutionary rate of \n\nmycoplasmas compared to other prokaryotes and is consistent with 16S rRNA \n\nphylogeny (Woese, 1987). \n\nIn general, the phylogenetic tree of RecA was consistent with the bacterial \n\ngroups defined on the basis of the 16S rRNA gene analysis (Ludwig, 2010), \n\ndemonstrating the high degree of conservation of RecA which broadly parallels that of \n\n16S rRNA. However, some discrepancies were observed, which are identified in Fig. \n\n11.2 by red boxes. In the case of Gammaproteobacteria, the phylogenetic tree of RecA \n\nshowed a separation of Acidithiobacillus and representatives of Chromatiales and \n\nLegionellales from the remaining Gammaproteobacteria members, which is in \n\nagreement with the polyphyletic nature of Gammaproteobacteria previously proposed \n\nbased on a set of 356 protein families (Williams et al., 2010). The \n\ngammaproteobacterium Cellvibrio gilvus was found to cluster with Actinobacteria, \n\nwhich is in accordance with recent observations leading to the proposal of the \n\nreclassification of this species (Christopherson et al., 2012). Sequences from \n\nDeltaproteobacteria were located distantly from the remaining proteobacterial \n\nmembers, suggesting that the Proteobacteria phylum itself does not have a monophyletic \n\norigin, in accordance with conclusions drawn by several authors using molecular \n\nmarkers alternative to rRNA-coding genes (Zouine et al., 2002; Gophna et al., 2005; \n\nDagan et al., 2010). Furthermore, the representative sequence for phylum Acidobacteria \n\nused in the present study clustered within the class Deltaproteobacteria, in agreement \n\nwith a previous work that used 31 gene orthologs to reconstruct the tree of life \n\n(Ciccarelli et al., 2006). In conclusion, these results suggest that the RecA protein is a \n\nuseful molecular marker to infer evolutionary relationships among bacteria since, in \n\ngeneral, it reflects 16S rRNA phylogeny. \n\nIn order to gain further insights into the suitability of the recA gene as a \n\nphylogenetic marker, as suggested by the RecA protein tree, the phylogenetic \n\ninformation provided by recA and the 16S rRNA genes was compared by constructing \n\nphylogenetic trees using the two genes for Deltaproteobacteria and Firmicutes, which \n\n\n\nChapter 11 \n\n196 \n\nwere found to contain several bacterial members with multiple recA copies (see section \n\nbellow). Additionally, since the RecA protein tree suggested a polyphyletic nature of \n\nGammaproteobacteria, recA and 16S rRNA trees were also constructed for this group. \n\n \n\nA B \n\n  \n\nFig. 11.3. Phylogenetic tree of recA (A) and 16S rRNA (B) genes in Gammaproteobacteria. Bootstrap values of 50 % or greater are \n\nshown at the appropriate nodes. Labels and colour shadings are used to put in evidence commonly used subdivisions. \n\n \n\nThe phylogeny of Gammaproteobacteria based on recA and 16S rRNA gene \n\nsequences is represented in Fig. 11.3. Both trees indicate that several of the established \n\ngammaproteobacterial orders, including Alteromonadales, Oceanospirillales, \n\nPseudomonadales and Chromatiales, are not monophyletic, in accordance with the \n\nconclusions of Williams et al. (2010) based on a set of 356 protein families. \n\nAdditionally, in the recA tree the representative sequences of the Enterobacteriales \n\norder did not cluster together, being the sequences from Edwardsiella species more \n\nclose to those from members of Pseudomonadales than to the remaining \n\n\n\nChapter 11 \n\n197 \n\nEnterobacteriales. Additionally, sequences from Shewanella species, belonging to the \n\nAlteromonadales order, were found to cluster within Enterobacteriales. \n\nGammaproteobacteria show particularly high rates of lateral gene transfer events (Abby \n\net al., 2012) which could be a contributing factor for the higher degree of divergence \n\nbetween recA and 16S rRNA trees observed in this group. \n\nThe phylogeny of Deltaproteobacteria based on recA and 16S rRNA genes is \n\nrepresented in Fig. 11.4. In general, the phylogenetic information provided by both trees \n\nwas analogous, including the possibility of Desulfobacterales being a polyphyletic \n\ngroup. On the other hand, while the 16S rRNA gene tree suggested that \n\nDesulphurellales might represent a lineage distinct from the remaining \n\nDeltaproteobacteria, the same was not observed in the recA tree, in which \n\nDesulphurellales clustered together with Bdellovibrionales.  \n\nThe phylogenetic trees of Firmicutes based on 16S rRNA and recA genes are \n\nrepresented in Fig 11.5. A general agreement in the phylogenetic information of both \n\ntrees was also observed in the case of Firmicutes, including the clustering of the \n\nAlicyclobacillaceae Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius and Kyrpidia tusciae, usually \n\nclassified as Bacilli, within the Clostridia cluster. On the other hand, while the two \n\nrepresentative Negativicutes sequences clustered together in the 16S rRNA gene tree, \n\nthis did not occur in the recA tree. \n\n \n\nrecA duplication and horizontal gene transfer \n\nThe presence of more than one copy of the recA gene was detected in 28 out of \n\nthe 1076 chromosomes analyzed (2.6 %) (Table 11.2). The identity between the two \n\nrecA gene copies (median = 63.5 %) ranged from 41 % in Lactococcus lactis sp. lactis \n\nKF147 to 91 % in Frankia sp., which could indicate that, in general, the two genes are \n\nunlikely to have resulted from a recent duplication event. The presence of more than \n\none recA copy in bacterial chromosomes had been previously described in Myxococcus \n\nxanthus and Bacillus megaterium DMS 319 (2 copies), as well as in the cyanobacterium \n\nAcaryochloris marina (3 copies) (Norioka et al., 1995; Nahrstedt et al., 2005; Swingley \n\net al., 2008). The present work indicates that the duplication of the recA gene may be \n\ncommon in certain bacterial groups, particularly Deltaproteobacteria and Firmicutes. \n\n\n\nChapter 11 \n\n198 \n\nTable 11.2.

Phylogenetic tree of recA (A) and 16S rRNA (B) genes in Deltaproteobacteria. Bootstrap values of 50 % or greater are \n\nshown at the appropriate nodes. Labels and colour shadings are used to put in evidence commonly used subdivisions. \n\n \n\nrecA duplication in Deltaproteobacteria \n\nTwo (and, in the case of Corallococcus coralloides DSM 2259, three) copies of \n\nthe recA gene were found in all the available complete genome sequences of members \n\nof the Myxococcales order. The identity of the two copies ranged between 49 % in \n\nStigmatella aurantiaca and 74 % in Anaeromyxobacter sp. K. When Karlin et al. (1995) \n\nfirst reported the presence of two recA genes in M. xanthus, the authors suggested that \n\nthe higher amount of the RecA repair protein would allow this topsoil bacteria to \n\nwithstand UV irradiation. The present observation of the widespread duplication of recA \n\nin myxobacteria inhabiting various environments suggests that UV radiation is not the \n\nonly factor underlying the presence of additional copies of the recA gene. \n\nMyxococcales typically display large genomes ranging from ~10 to 13 Mb, \n\nwhile anaerobic myxobacteria belonging to the genus Anaeromyxobacter have smaller \n\ngenome sizes (~5 Mb). The typically large genome size of myxobacteria seems to be \n\ndue to genome expansion as a result of duplications of specific categories of genes, \n\nparticularly those involved in cell-cell signaling, small molecule sensing and \n\nmulticomponent transcriptional control. Such genome expansion allowed the evolution \n\nof the complex molecular machinery required for the development of a multicellular \n\nlifestyle typical of myxobacteria (Goldman et al., 2006). As hypothesized for the \n\ncyanobacteria Acaryochloris marina (Swingley et al., 2008; Miller et al., 2011), it is \n\npossible that the presence of multiple copies of recA and related genes in a \n\n\n\nChapter 11 \n\n200 \n\nmyxobacteria ancestral could have mediated the gene duplication and/or integration of \n\nforeign genes that led to their genome expansion, and at the same time would allow \n\ngenome stability, through its role in the DNA damage repair and DNA recombination. It \n\nis interesting to notice that in the case of Candidatus Solibacter usitatus (Phylum \n\nAcidobacteria), which also possesses a very large genome (10 Mb), there are also three \n\nannotated copies of the recA gene in the genome (though two of them are smaller than \n\nthe expected size). Since not all large bacterial genomes display multiple copies of the \n\nrecA gene, it is possible that recA duplication could have played an important role in the \n\nexpansion of the genome of bacteria belonging to particular phylogenetic groups, such \n\nas the cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina, myxobacteria and the Acidobacteria \n\nCandidatus Solibacter usitatus.  \n\n \n\nrecA duplication in Firmicutes \n\nDuplication of the recA gene was also detected in some Firmicutes genomes \n\nsuch as those of Lactobacillus and Lactococcus species and Bacillus megaterium which \n\nbelong to Bacilli, and the Clostridia Moorella thermoacetica (Table 11.2). In the case of \n\nM. thermoacetica the second gene copy was found to be more similar to the homologs \n\nof Bacilli than Clostridia (Fig. 11.5). The identity between the two gene copies ranged \n\nbetween 41 % in Lactococcus lactis sp. lactis KF147 and 76 % in Bacillus megaterium \n\nQM B1551. The presence of two recA copies in B. megaterium had previously been \n\nreported and proposed to contribute to increase its ability for recombinational repair and \n\nenhance its resistance to DNA damage compared to other Bacillus species (Nahrstedt et \n\nal., 2005). The presence of two copies of the recA gene among members of Firmicutes \n\nof different phylogenetic lineages (Clostridia and Bacilli) could either be explained by \n\nhorizontal acquisition of the extra recA gene or an ancient duplication event in a \n\nFirmicutes ancestor with subsequent loss of the gene in all other Clostridia except M. \n\nthermoacetica.  \n\nIn order to address the possible horizontal acquisition of recA genes in \n\nFirmicutes, the G+C content of the gene and the respective genome was compared \n\n(Table 11.3). Among Firmicutes, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris A76 and \n\nLactobacillus rhamnosus Lc 705 displayed considerable differences between the G+C \n\ncontent of the second recA gene and the average genomic G+C content, by \n\napproximately 13 % and 10 %, respectively. \n\n\n\nChapter 11 \n\n201 \n\nA B \n\nFig. 11.5.

Labels and colour shadings are used to put in evidence commonly used subdivisions. \n\n \n\nSuch difference could indicate an exogenous acquisition of the second recA copy \n\nin these organisms. Furthermore, in the case of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris A76, \n\nBLASTP searches using the second RecA as a query revealed it was most related with \n\nthe RecA homolog (RecAlp) from the plasmid pNP40 of Lactococcus lactis, raising the \n\npossibility of the mobility of the recA gene being mediated through mobile genetic \n\nelements.  \n\n\n\nChapter 11 \n\n202 \n\nTable 11.3.

A much lower similarity \n\nof the two recA copies in Lactobacillus (60 %), Lactococcus (45 %) and Moorella (65 \n\n%), suggests that divergence between the copies could have taken place earlier in their \n\nevolution or eventually the second copy could have been acquired by horizontal gene \n\ntransfer. Nevertheless, the concordance between recA and 16S rRNA trees suggests that \n\npotential gene transfer events have not obscured the phylogenetic relationships.  \n\nIn B. megaterium both copies seem to be functional (Nahrstedt et al., 2005), \n\nwhile in the other Firmicutes members this is not known. The investigation of the \n\nfunctionality of the two recA copies among other Firmicutes could shed further light \n\ninto the potential role of RecA in the evolution of these lineages. Speculations can only \n\nbe made about the significance of the presence of the extra recA among these bacterial \n\nmembers. Lactococcus and Lactobacillus are microaerophilic organisms that under \n\ncertain conditions can tolerate oxygen. However, oxygen consumption results in altered \n\nredox state with the formation of reactive oxygen species which can pose a significant \n\nthreat (Duwat et al., 1995). The involvement of RecA in resistance to oxidative and \n\nthermal stress has been reported in Lactococcus lactis, in which it seems to play an \n\nimportant role in the repair of damage induced by the hydroxyl radical generated by the \n\nFenton reaction (Duwat et al., 1995). Whether the presence of an extra recA gene \n\nconfers a supplementary protection to DNA damage in these bacteria, is not known. \n\n\n\nChapter 11 \n\n203 \n\nMoorella thermoacetica, on the other hand, is strictly anaerobic, making additional \n\nprotection against oxidative stress as the explanation for the presence of a second recA \n\ncopy paradoxical. However, previous investigations showed the presence in M. \n\nthermoacetica of a gene cluster coding for proteins involved in oxidative and nitrosative \n\nstress protection, including an aerobic type Fe/Mn superoxide dismutase (SOD) and \n\ncatalase (Das et al., 2005). Based on these observations, one possible explanation for the \n\npresence of two recA copies in M. thermoacetica was the presence of the two recA \n\ngenes in an ancestral common to Bacilli and Clostridia that was latter lost from the \n\nremaining Clostridia and then from most Bacilli. As before, whether this extra copy is \n\nfunctional and possesses a role in the fitness of this organism, is unknown and merits \n\nfurther research. \n\n \n\nrecA duplications in other bacterial groups \n\nIn the gammaproteobacterium Pseudomonas mendocina ymp, the second recA \n\ngene displayed a high deviation in its G+C content compared to the average of the \n\ngenome (51.7 % versus 64.6 %, Table 11.3). The corresponding protein showed a \n\nmaximum identity of 77 % with the RecA from Shewanella sp. MR-4. These \n\nobservations indicate that the second recA gene of Pseudomonas mendocina ymp could \n\nhave been acquired by a horizontal gene transfer event. Furthermore, analysis of the \n\ngenomic context of the second recA copy revealed the presence of two genes coding for \n\nputative transposases immediately downstream. Genes encoding for the presence of \n\ntransposases in the immediate vicinity of the recA gene were detected in other 22 \n\ngenomes (supplementary information in Appendix), four of them associated to recA \n\nduplicates (Lactococcus lactis KF147, Frankia sp. EAMI1pec, Moorella thermoacetica \n\nATCC 39073 and Pseudomonas mendocina ymp). In the case of the \n\nGammaproteobacteria Frankia sp. EAMI1pec and Pseudomonas mendocina ymp the \n\npresence of putative transposases belonging to the same family (IS4) was observed. \n\nWhether these genetic elements could have played a role in the acquisition of the \n\nadditional recA, is unknown.  \n\n \n\nPresence of recA in plasmids \n\nThe presence of recA homologs was detected in 31 plasmids deposited in the \n\nNCBI database (Table 11.4). The existence of plasmid-located recA genes was already \n\nreported in Lactococcus lactis (Garvey et al., 1997), Vibrio sp. (Hazen et al., 2007), \n\n\n\nChapter 11 \n\n204 \n\nAcaryochloris marina (Swingley et al., 2008) and Deinococcus deserti (Dulermo et al., \n\n2009). In the present work, plasmid-encoded recA genes were also detected in plasmids \n\nof members of the gammaproteobacterial genera Escherichia, Serratia, Pseudomonas, \n\nYersinia and Salmonella, the Firmicutes Paenibacillus and the Chloroflexi \n\nThermomicrobium. Inter-subspecies lateral gene transfer of recA has been demonstrated \n\nat least in Salmonella species (McQuiston et al., 2008), and our observations raise the \n\npossibility of the involvement of plasmids in the process. \n\nIn general, plasmid-encoded recA genes showed the highest identity with recA \n\ngenes encoded in the chromosome of the host organism, but some exceptions were \n\nobserved (Table 11.4). For example, the recA gene in plasmid pSM22 of Serratia \n\nmarcescens strain B-6493 (Enterobacteriales) encoded a protein that showed its highest \n\nidentity to the RecA of Aggregatibacter aphrophilus ATCC 33389 (Pasteurellales). In \n\nthis case, a notable difference (7 %) was also observed between the G+C content of the \n\nplasmid-encoded recA gene and the G+C content of the plasmid, which could indicate \n\nan exogenous origin. It is also noteworthy the presence of a gene encoding a transposase \n\nin the vicinity of the plasmid-encoded recA (Fig. 11.6 A, B). The presence in the \n\nplasmid of a gene coding for DNA polymerase V subunit, which performs translesion \n\nDNA synthesis during the SOS response, immediately adjacent to the recA gene (Fig. \n\n11.6 A, B) could suggest that this plasmid-encoded copy might fulfil a role in \n\ncomplementing the chromosomally elicited SOS response.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 11.6. Genomic context of recA in the plasmids of (A) Serratia marcescens strain B-6493 (plasmid pSM22) and (B) \n\nThermomicrobium roseum. In both cases, DNA polymerases involved in error repair are present in the vicinity of the recA gene. The \n\ndisplayed length is proportional to the size of the corresponding open reading frame. \n\n \n\nIn the Chloroflexi Thermomicrobium the protein encoded by the plasmid recA \n\ngene showed a maximum identity (31 %) to the homologous of the \n\nalphaproteobacterium Hyphomicrobium denitrificans ATCC 51888.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 11 \n\n205 \n\nTable 11.4.

In some bacterial strains such as those \n\nbelonging to the Mycoplasma genus, the recA gene is interrupted by intein-coding \n\nsequences with a homing endonuclease function. In some Bacillus and Geobacillus \n\nspecies recA is also interrupted by introns, which might have played an evolutionary \n\nrole. In general, the phylogeny of the RecA protein supports the phyla defined on the \n\nbasis of rRNA gene analysis demonstrating its high degree of conservation resulting \n\nfrom its fundamental housekeeping role in bacteria. recA and 16S rRNA trees of \n\nDeltaproteobacteria and Firmicutes were broadly in agreement. Results were more \n\ndivergent in Gammaproteobacteria, suggesting that recA may not be a good molecular \n\nmarker for this group. The presence of two copies of the recA gene seems to be a \n\ncommon feature of myxobacteria, where it could have mediated its genome expansion. \n\nrecA duplication is also frequent among some Firmicutes. Further work is necessary to \n\nassess the functionality of the newly detected extra copies of recA. Additionally, our \n\nresults point to the possibility of acquisition of extra recA genes by horizontal gene \n\ntransfer with a possible involvement of plasmids in mediating the acquisition. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThis work was supported by CESAM (Centre for Environmental and Marine Studies, University of \n\nAveiro) and the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) in the form of a PhD grant to \n\nA.L.

Moura (SFRH/BPD/72256/2010). \n\n\n\nChapter 12 \n\n207 \n\nCHAPTER 12 \n\nDISCUSSION \n\nThe combined effects of global changes, such as ocean acidification and thermal \n\nstratification, and changes in solar UV fluxes are expected to result in enhanced \n\nexposure of aquatic organisms to damaging UV wavelengths over the course of the next \n\ndecades, with far reaching ecological consequences (Andrady et al., 2010).  \n\nThe effects of UV radiation are well known to be wavelength-dependent (Sundin \n\nand Jacobs, 1999; Qiu et al., 2004; Wilson et al., 2004; Qiu et al., 2005a; Bauermeister \n\net al., 2009). A relatively large number of studies have addressed the effects of UV \n\nradiation, particularly in the UVB range, on natural bacterioplankton assemblages from \n\nvarious geographic locations (Bailey et al., 1983; Herndl et al., 1993; M\u00fcller-Niklas et \n\nal., 1995; Sommaruga et al., 1997; Pakulski et al., 1998; Alonso-S\u00e1ez et al., 2006; \n\nLangenheder et al., 2006; Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2007; Joux et al., 2009; Santos et al., 2011a; \n\nSantos et al., 2012a; Santos et al., 2012b).  \n\nIn the environment, the interaction between UV radiation and microorganisms is \n\ncomplex and influenced by several factors, including species composition, \n\nenvironmental factors such as temperature, salinity and nutrients, as well as intrinsic \n\nproperties, like DNA repair potential, cell size and growth phase (Berney et al., 2006c; \n\nJoux et al., 2009; Matallana-Surget et al., 2010). In the case of the UVB range, the \n\neffects on aquatic organisms are, at least in part, determined by the dose of harmful \n\nradiation to which an individual organism is exposed which, in turn, is affected by both \n\nthe positioning of the organism in the water column and the optical characteristics (i.e. \n\nUVB transmittance) of the water body (Sommaruga, 2003).  \n\n \n\nBacterioneuston as a model community for environmental photobiology \n\nstudies \n\nLocated at the air-water interface, the surface microlayer (SML) represents a \n\nunique microbial niche (Norkrans, 1980) inhabited by a bacterial community, i.e. \n\nbacterioneuston, that is particularly exposed to high doses of solar UV radiation (Hardy, \n\n1982). Despite these harmful conditions, the surface microlayer has been reported to \n\ncontain higher abundances of microorganisms than underlying waters (UW) (Norkrans, \n\n1980; Hardy, 1982; Agogu\u00e9 et al., 2004), suggesting that bacterioneuston might have \n\n\n\nChapter 12 \n\n208 \n\ndeveloped strategies to survive in this \u201cextreme environment\u201d. Therefore, \n\nbacterioneuston emerges as an interesting model system for the assessment of UVB \n\neffects on aquatic organisms, which might provide valuable predictive information on \n\nthe consequences of future changes in UV radiation levels in the underlying water \n\ncolumn. \n\nIn the present work, the influence of the light history of bacterial communities to \n\ntheir UVB sensitivity was assessed on two levels (1) by studying and comparing the \n\neffects of UVB exposure on the bacterial communities of the SML and UW in terms of \n\nabundance, activity, phylogenetic and physiological diversity, and (2) by studying and \n\ncomparing the photobiological responses of bacterial isolates retrieved from the SML \n\nand UW.  \n\nEffects of UVB radiation on bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton \n\nRegarding experiments with communities from the SML and UW, irradiation \n\nwas found to have a lower impact on the abundance of culturable and total bacteria in \n\nbacterioneuston than in bacterioplankton, suggesting the possibility of enhanced UVB \n\nresistance of bacterial communities from the SML. Decreases in cell abundance were \n\naccompanied by a reduction in the phylogenetic diversity of both bacterioneuston and \n\nbacterioplankton, revealed by DGGE fingerprinting, thus demonstrating the relevance \n\nof UVB radiation as a driver of the structure of bacterial communities. UVB-induced \n\nchanges in bacterial community structure can mainly be attributed to (i) differences in \n\nUVB sensitivity among bacterial members (Joux et al., 1999; Arrieta et al., 2000; \n\nAgogu\u00e9 et al., 2005; Santos et al., 2011b) and/or (ii) selection for bacterial community \n\nmembers specialized on photochemically modified dissolved organic matter (DOM) \n\ncompounds and resistant to oxidative stress induced by inhibitory photoproducts (Fisher \n\net al., 2008). Using DGGE analysis and sequencing, two ribotypes affiliated to the UV-\n\nresistant Gammaproteobacteria class (Alonso-S\u00e1ez et al., 2006) were found to persist \n\nthroughout the irradiation period in both bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton \n\nsuggesting the occurrence of selection of resistant strains by UVR. \n\nFISH analysis supported the qualitative information provided by DGGE, \n\nconfirming Gammaproteobacteria as the dominant group in bacterioneuston (Franklin \n\net al., 2005). Furthermore, FISH results revealed that the relative abundance of the UV-\n\nresistant Gammaproteobacteria class increased with UVB exposure, dominating both \n\nirradiated bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton. The observations made in the present \n\n\n\nChapter 12 \n\n209 \n\nwork indicate that UVB exposure might select photo-resistant members of the bacterial \n\ncommunity. Furthermore, the dominance of the UV-resistant Gammaproteobacteria \n\ngroup in the original SML community suggests that bacterioneuston may contain a pool \n\nof UV-resistant bacteria. This hypothesis is in accordance with earlier suggestions that \n\nmembers of bacterioneuston may have adapted to cope with the stressful conditions of \n\nthe SML (Hermansson et al., 1987). More recently, Stolle et al. (2011) also observed \n\nthat the strongest differences between the active communities of the non-attached size \n\nfraction of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton occurred in response to high radiation \n\nlevels. The authors suggested that UV radiation altered the community composition of \n\nnon-attached, active bacterioneuston members, particularly under low wind conditions, \n\nresulting in increased differences between bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton.  \n\nIn general, UVB-induced inhibition of protein synthesis was higher in \n\nbacterioneuston, while DNA synthesis was more inhibited in bacterioplankton. \n\nHowever, the observation of a lower UVB-induced decrease in cell abundance (total \n\nand culturable) in bacterioneuston compared to bacterioplankton, suggests enhanced UV \n\nresistance of bacterioneuston. It is possible that reducing protein synthesis upon UVB \n\nexposure could be a metabolic strategy that contributes to enhance survival, as actively \n\ngrowing bacteria are more susceptible to stress (Fischer and Sauer, 2005). Such a \n\nhypothesis would also help to explain the consistently reported lower bacterial biomass \n\nproductivity at the SML compared to UW (Obernosterer et al., 2008; Reinthaler et al., \n\n2008; Stolle et al., 2010), though nutrients often concentrate at the air-water interface \n\n(Williams et al., 1986). \n\nUVB also caused a shift in the physiological profiles of sole-carbon-source \n\nutilization of the communities, assessed by the Biolog EcoPlateTM approach. Though \n\nlimited in assessing the functional diversity of bacterial assemblages, Biolog \n\nEcoPlatesTM have been used in the study of carbon source use patterns in different \n\nenvironments (Christian and Lind, 2006). Biolog EcoPlatesTM have also been used to \n\nassess changes induced by sea ice melting in the functional diversity of bacterioplankton \n\n(Sala et al., 2010) and, together with the present work, reveal the potential of this tool to \n\nstudy the impact of global changes in the functioning of aquatic microbial communities.  \n\nThe use of Biolog EcoPlatesTM also provided new insights into the biology of \n\nbacterioneuston, specifically, the existence of clearly distinctive metabolic profiles in \n\nbacterioneuston and bacterioplankton. The original bacterioneuston community was \n\nable to use 11 out of the 32 substrates provided, being ?-ketobutyric acid (14.2 %) and \n\n\n\nChapter 12 \n\n210 \n\nglucose-1-phosphate (13.4 %) the most used substrates. On the other hand, the original \n\nbacterioplankton community was able to use 4 out of the 32 substrates provided, being \n\ni-erythritol (41.6 %) the most used one. These observations suggest substantial \n\ndifferences in the function of these structurally similar communities. Such results are in \n\naccordance with previous reports of differences in the relative abundances of bacterial \n\ngroups incorporating leucine, as well as differences in terms of functional traits \n\nassociated with trace gas metabolism, in the two communities (Cunliffe et al., 2008; \n\nObernosterer et al., 2008; H\u00f6rtnagl et al., 2010).  \n\nUVB exposure caused not only a decrease in the number of substrates used by \n\nboth communities but also a shift in the type of substrate preferably used. In \n\nbacterioneuston, the observed overall trend was from a metabolism relying mostly on \n\ncarbohydrates and amino acids in the original community to a metabolism mostly \n\ndependent on carbohydrates upon UVB exposure. In the case of bacterioplankton, the \n\nmetabolism of the original community was heavily dependent on the use of phenolic \n\ncompounds and relied mostly on the use of amino acids after irradiation. \n\nUVB-induced shifts in metabolic profiles can be related to alterations in \n\nmicrobial community composition or adaptation of the prevalent community to UVB \n\nradiation (Insam and Goberna, 2004). In the latter case, changes in the profiles of \n\ncarbon sources preferably used are expected to be a consequence of a shift from cellular \n\ngrowth to DNA repair and other processes to ameliorate UVB-induced damage. \n\nHowever, the meaning of the observed metabolic shifts is still difficult to explain, in \n\nlight of current knowledge. Further studies using, for instance, a metabolomic approach \n\nwill help to gain more insights into the metabolic events that follow UVB exposure and \n\ntheir biological and ecological consequences. \n\nExperimental considerations \n\nThe effects of UVB radiation on the structural and functional diversity of \n\nbacterioneuston and bacterioplankton were studied using a microcosm setup under \n\nlaboratorial conditions. The depth of the irradiated SML and UW samples was similar \n\nand corresponded to approximately the averaged depth of the SML described in the \n\nliterature (Cunliffe et al., 2011). Clear effects of UVB on the abundance, diversity and \n\nactivity of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton were observed, and a potential for the \n\nSML to contain bacterial members adapted to cope with high UV levels emerged. \n\nHowever, the possibility that these effects were exacerbated by the experimental setup \n\n\n\nChapter 12 \n\n211 \n\nused cannot be excluded, as it most likely limited natural avoidance mechanisms, such \n\nas vertical migration, and did not allow the diffusion of toxic by-products of DOM \n\nphotodegradation (Sommaruga, 2003). Nevertheless, such biases were present in both \n\nSML and UW experimental setups and should not compromise the comparison of the \n\nresponses of both communities.  \n\nPreliminary experiments indicated that the removal of neither zooplankton nor \n\nphytoplankton from water samples affected, with statistical significance, the \n\nphotobiological responses of the two bacterial communities, in accordance to previous \n\nworks (Alonso-S\u00e1ez et al., 2006). The possibility that the overall bacterial responses \n\nobserved may have a contribution of the effects of UVB on other members of the SML \n\nand UW communities, namely virus, cannot be excluded, but this can actually help to \n\ncontextualize bacterial photobiological responses in the context of the microbial food \n\nweb. \n\nIsolation of UV-resistant bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton \n\nIn order to gain further insights into the influence of the light history of bacterial \n\ncommunities on their photobiological responses, UVB-resistant bacteria were isolated \n\nfrom the surface microlayer and underlying waters of the estuarine system of Ria de \n\nAveiro. The individual UVB sensitivity of the retrieved isolates was then assessed in \n\nterms of CFU numbers, activity (leucine and thymidine incorporation), sole-carbon \n\nsource use profiles, repair potential (light-dependent and independent), and \n\nphotoadaptation potential under different physiological conditions.  \n\nAs observed with experiments conducted with communities, isolates from the \n\nSML were, on average, significantly more resistant to UVB-induced damage than those \n\nretrieved from the UW, as assessed from culturable counts. Leucine incorporation was \n\nmore reduced in bacterioneuston isolates than in bacterioplankton isolates, while \n\nthymidine incorporation was equally inhibited by UVB exposure in both sets of isolates. \n\nA shift in the physiological profile of the bacterial isolates with UVB exposure, assayed \n\nusing Biolog EcoPlatesTM, was also observed, in accordance with the results obtained in \n\nthe experiments with bacterial communities. Such a shift was particularly considerable \n\nin bacterioneuston isolates, which displayed statistically significant decreases in the \n\nutilization of amines and amino acids with irradiation. This shift in the physiological \n\nprofile could reflect an active transcriptional reaction of the cells to UVB stress, \n\ninvolving a change in metabolic resource allocation from growth to defence/repair, \n\n\n\nChapter 12 \n\n212 \n\nand/or could be a consequence of metabolic restructuring to compensate for UV-\n\ninduced damage to sensitive enzymes.  \n\nUV sensitivity and repair potential was found to be affected by the nutritional \n\ncondition of the cell, with nutrient depleted cells displaying enhanced sensitivity to \n\nUVB radiation and enhanced inhibition of thymidine incorporation. This observation \n\ndenotes modulation of UVB responses by the nutritional status of the cell. In \n\nbacterioneuston, but not in bacterioplankton, recovery from UVB-induced damage was \n\nenhanced under nutrient starvation, suggesting the possibility of an intrinsic adaptation \n\nof bacterioneuston to nutrient depletion. Dissolved organic compounds (e.g., free amino \n\nacids) are known to accumulate at the SML (Williams et al., 1986). However, \n\nbacterioneuston seems to display consistently lower bacterial growth efficiencies than \n\nbacterioplankton, indicating differences in the physiological state of bacterioneuston \n\nand bacterioplankton (Kuznetsova and Lee, 2002; Reinthaler et al., 2008). Rapidly \n\ngrowing cells are often more susceptible to inactivation than slower growing ones, \n\nbecause of the shorter time for excision repair between rounds of replication (Harm, \n\n1980; Jagger, 1985). The present work raises the possibility that natural differences in \n\nphysiological state of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton could influence their UV \n\nsensitivity and help to explain the enhanced UVB resistance of bacterioneuston. \n\n \n\nNew insights into the mechanisms of UV-induced damage \n\nThough UV radiation of different wavelengths is well known to cause damage to \n\ncells, ultimately resulting in cell death (Moan and Peak, 1989), the cellular targets of \n\nUV radiation, particularly in the UVB range, in bacteria and the mechanisms whereby \n\nradiation elicits damage to the cell are still unclear.  \n\nIn order to gain further insights into the mechanisms of UV-induced damage, a \n\nset of bacterial isolates with different UV sensitivities was used as biological models to \n\nstudy (1) the wavelength-dependence of the biological damage elicited by UV radiation, \n\n(2) the identity and targets of the ROS involved in UVB-induced damage, (3) the \n\ninfluence of transition metals in the oxidative damage elicited by UVB exposure and (4) \n\nthe role of abiotic properties and bacterial growth conditions in UVB-induced damage.\n\n\n\nChapter 12 \n\n213 \n\nWavelength-dependence of UV-induced damage \n\nReduction in cell numbers and activity, as well as DNA damage, displayed a \n\nclear wavelength-dependent variation following exposure to UV radiation of different \n\nspectral regions (UVA, UVB and UVC), being highest under UVC and lowest under \n\nUVA. Intracellular ROS generation, lipid oxidation (TBARS) and protein \n\ncarbonylation, showed an inverse pattern, being highest upon exposure to UVA \n\nirradiation. These observations are in good agreement with earlier observations denoting \n\nthe indirect, oxidative nature of UVA-induced damage (Eisenstark, 1970; Webb and \n\nLorenz, 1970; Reed, 1997) and the high genotoxic potential of UVC radiation (Moan \n\nand Peak, 1989). \n\nPrincipal component analysis confirmed the involvement of the extent of the \n\noxidative damage to lipids and proteins, as well as ROS levels, in separating UVA-\n\ntreated samples from the remaining, while the extent of DNA damage, assessed as DNA \n\nstrand breaks (DSB), contributed the most for the separation of UVC-treated samples. \n\nEffects of UVB were found to be intermediate between those of UVA and UVC, in \n\naccordance with previous observations (Qiu et al., 2005a). \n\nIn order to identify the main determinants of bacterial inactivation under the \n\ndifferent UV wavelengths, multiple linear stepwise regression analysis was applied to \n\nthe data set. Despite the fact that UVA-treated samples were differentiated from the \n\nremaining treatments by enhanced levels of ROS and protein and lipid oxidation, \n\nsurprisingly the amount of DSB emerged as the major determinant of inactivation upon \n\nexposure to UVA. DNA does not have a strong absorption in the UVA range. \n\nTherefore, UVA-induced damage to DNA is usually considered to be a result of \n\nphotodynamic reactions mediated by cellular chromophores (Cadet et al., 2005a). \n\nHowever, recent investigations conducted in eukaryotes have highlighted the high \n\nmutagenic potential of UVA (R\u00fcnger et al., 2012) and the role of cyclobutane \n\npyrimidine dimers, rather than oxidative lesions, in UVA-induced damage (Ikehata et \n\nal., 2008). The most UVA sensitive strains displayed significantly higher levels of DSB \n\nand TBARS (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05) than resistant ones. Taken together, these \n\nresults suggest that the extent of oxidative damage to biomolecules underlies the \n\nvariability in UVA susceptibility among different bacteria but, ultimately, it is the \n\naccumulation of DNA lesions that leads to cell death under this radiation regime. \n\n\n\nChapter 12 \n\n214 \n\nUnder UVB, the main determinants of inactivation were found to be oxidative \n\ndamage to lipids (TBARS), accumulation of DNA damage, as well as loss of metabolic \n\nactivity. These results indicate the involvement of changes in the integrity of membrane \n\nstructure and functionality, besides DNA damage, in bacterial inactivation by UVB \n\nradiation. The most UVB sensitive strains displayed significantly higher levels of \n\nprotein carbonyls than resistant ones (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05), suggesting a role of \n\nprotein oxidative damage in determining bacterial sensitivity to UVB radiation. \n\nEnhanced levels of protein chaperones were previously reported in Sphingopyxis \n\nalaskensis following UVB exposure (Matallana-Surget et al., 2009a), denoting the \n\nimportance of maintaining proper protein structure and function upon irradiation under \n\nUVB.  \n\nRegression analysis revealed that ROS levels together with DNA damage were \n\nthe best predictors of cell inactivation under UVC. The most UVC sensitive strains were \n\ncharacterized by significantly higher TBARS and carbonyls levels than resistant ones \n\n(1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05). These results suggest that the extent of ROS-mediated \n\ndamage to lipids and proteins, probably by interfering with vital biological functions, is \n\na critical component of UVC-induced inactivation (Krisko and Radman, 2010; Schenk \n\net al., 2011). Unexpectedly, ROS levels were significantly higher in resistant strains \n\nthan in sensitive ones (1-way ANOVA, p &lt;0.05). ROS are known to be involved in \n\neliciting specific defence strategies in response to UVC exposure in cyanobacteria \n\n(Dillon et al., 2002) and plants (Murphy and Huerta, 1990). The present work raises the \n\npossibility that ROS might play a physiological role in mediating the responses of \n\nbacteria to UVC radiation that deserves further investigation. \n\nIn order to gain additional insights into the cellular targets of UV radiation of \n\ndifferent wavelengths, the effects of irradiation on the lipids and proteins of two \n\nrepresentative bacteria with distinct UV sensitivities were studied by mid-infrared \n\nspectroscopy. In general, exposure to UV radiation of different wavelengths resulted in \n\nan increase in lipid methylation, denoted by the increase in the intensity of mid-infrared \n\nbands at approximately 2950 cm-1, 2870 cm-1, 1460 cm-1 and 1370 cm-1. Lipid \n\nmethylation strongly affects the fluidity of cellular membranes and changes in \n\nmembrane fluidity have been associated with cellular adaptation to stress in Oenococcus \n\noeni (Delmas et al., 2001) and signal transduction in higher organisms (Sangwan et al., \n\n2002). Whether such changes could be involved in eliciting the bacterial response to UV \n\nradiation, is unknown. \n\n\n\nChapter 12 \n\n215 \n\nAdditionally, changes in the intensity of methyl bands together with decreased \n\nintensity of bands associated with esters and glyco- and/or phospholipids were also \n\nobserved, suggesting altered lipid composition upon UV exposure. Such changes could \n\nreflect a consequence of damage to enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. \n\nAlternatively, it could represent a metabolic strategy to preserve the resources of the cell \n\nfor repair strategies, for example, by using less phosphorus for phospholipid synthesis, \n\ndiverting it for DNA repair strategies that require ATP. \n\nUV exposure also resulted in a general increase in the intensity of mid-infrared \n\nbands associated with lipid oxidation products, denoting the potential of UV radiation to \n\ninduce lipid oxidation also suggested from the measurement of TBARS levels. \n\nMid-infrared analysis of proteins extracted from irradiated cells showed UV-\n\ninduced changes in the frequency and/or intensity of the components of the mid-infrared \n\namide I band centred at approximately 1650 cm-1, thus suggesting altered protein \n\nconformation and/or composition with irradiation. The observed changes in protein \n\nconformation could be associated with (1) induction of repair strategies (Demple, 1991), \n\n(2) aggregation and/or oxidative modifications of amino acid side chains, also consistent \n\nwith the observed decrease in intensity of the mid-infrared band of tyrosine at \n\napproximately 1518 cm-1 (Lasch et al., 2001), and (3) synthesis of proteins with \n\ndifferent composition and/or conformations in response to UV radiation (Matallana-\n\nSurget et al., 2009a; Bosshard et al., 2010b). \n\nAdditionally, mid-infrared spectroscopy revealed that UV exposure was also \n\naccompanied by a substantial increase in the intensity of methylene/CH2 (and to a lesser \n\nextent, methyl/CH3) bands associated with proteins and/or amino acids. This \n\nobservation can reflect changes in protein composition, specifically, an increase in the \n\nrelative proportion of amino acids particularly rich in CH2 groups, like proline, lysine, \n\nisoleucine or glutamine/glutamic acid, potentially involved in stress protection (Kov\u00e1?ik \n\net al., 2010). Additionally, enhanced intensity of bands assigned to CH3 and CH2 \n\nstretching vibrations can arise as a result of the addition of these groups to proteins \n\nduring the process of propionylation of lysine residues (Singh et al., 2012). \n\nPropionylation is involved in the regulation of the activity of some enzymes in bacteria \n\n(Garrity et al., 2007). Whether this process could play a role in the metabolic response \n\nof bacteria to UV-induced stress is unknown and an interesting matter of research.  \n\nFinally, UV exposure also resulted in a general decrease in intensity of mid-\n\ninfrared bands associated with glycosylated and/or phosphorylated proteins in the region \n\n\n\nChapter 12 \n\n216 \n\nbetween 1200-900 cm-1. This observation could possibly denote a decrease in the \n\nphosphorylation level of proteins, which was previously observed in Xanthomonas \n\noryzae following UVC exposure (Huang et al., 1995), and/or decreased protein \n\nglycosylation levels. Changes in protein glycosylation levels are known to be involved \n\nin the regulation of the activity of specific proteins, including the RecA protein \n\ncoordinating the SOS response of bacteria (Fischer and Haas, 2004). \n\nWhether the modifications observed by mid-infrared spectroscopy in bacterial \n\nlipids and proteins reflect UV-induced damage to biomolecules or could actually be \n\ninvolved in a UV stress response mechanism is unknown and warrants further research. \n\nAdditional studies using complementary techniques, such as mass spectrometry-based \n\nlipidomics and proteomics, could help to address the specific questions raised during \n\nthis investigation. \n\nIdentity and targets of ROS in UVB-induced damage \n\nIn order to identify the ROS involved in UVB-induced damage and their \n\nbiological targets, bacterial suspensions were pre-treated with specific scavengers for \n\ndifferent ROS (hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen and superoxide \n\nradical) before irradiation and their photobiological responses compared with those of \n\nisolates not amended with the scavengers.  \n\nAmendment of cell suspensions with sodium azide, a singlet oxygen scavenger, \n\nenhanced survival during UVB exposure and conferred a statistically significant \n\nprotective effect against lipid oxidation. These observations indicate that singlet oxygen \n\nmight play a pivotal role in UVB-induced cell inactivation, previously identified in \n\neukaryotic cells (Vile and Tyrrell, 1995).  \n\nThe hydroxyl radical, on the other hand, might be involved in DNA damage, as \n\nsuggested by the observation of statistically significant lower levels of DSB in \n\nmannitol-amended samples. Such observation is in accordance with previous reports of \n\nthe contribution of the hydroxyl radical to DNA damage in human cells exposed to UV \n\nradiation (Peak and Peak, 1990). Mannitol also significantly attenuated protein \n\ncarbonylation during UVB exposure, indicating the participation of the hydroxyl radical \n\nin oxidative damage to proteins during UVB exposure. \n\nThe addition of exogenous CAT and SOD significantly protected the capacity \n\nfor glucose uptake and respiration, suggesting that superoxide and H2O2 potentially \n\nparticipate in the impairment of metabolic activity during UVB exposure.  \n\n\n\nChapter 12 \n\n217 \n\nHowever, in some cases amendment with ROS scavenger resulted in an \n\nexacerbation of the detrimental effect of UVB radiation on biological parameters. In \n\nparticular, a statistically significant increase in the amount of DSB was observed upon \n\npre-treatment of cells with SOD and CAT, suggesting that the activity of these enzymes \n\ncan contribute to the oxidative damage of biomolecules during exposure to UVB. Such \n\nobservation is in accordance with previous work reporting the ability of CAT activity to \n\ngenerate ROS during UVB exposure when the antioxidant capabilities of the cell are \n\ndiminished (Heck et al., 2003; Heck et al., 2010). SOD can also contribute to enhance \n\nthe oxidative burden of the cell since H2O2 generated from its activity is a more oxidant \n\nspecies than superoxide (Scott et al., 1989). Ultimately, depending on the intracellular \n\noxidation status of the cell, the activity of these antioxidant enzymes in response to \n\nUVB radiation can be either protective or cytotoxic. \n\nRole of metals in UVB-induced damage \n\nMetals play a crucial catalytic role in the production of free radicals and \n\noxidative stress. In recent years, research conducted in different biological models has \n\nhighlighted the role of divalent cationic metals in protection against the detrimental \n\neffects of several stressors (Daly et al., 2004; Bagwell et al., 2008; Ghosh et al., 2011; \n\nGranger et al., 2011). However, the role of transition metals on the susceptibility of \n\nbacteria to environmentally relevant UVB radiation is unknown. This information is \n\ncrucial to fully understand the effects UV radiation in bacterial communities in natural \n\nenvironments, where metals are frequently present and may represent an additional \n\nstress factor (Zhou, et al., 2008) \n\nIn general, UVB and metal amendment, most notably iron, copper and \n\nmanganese, contributed synergistically to enhance bacterial inactivation. In particular, \n\niron amendment exacerbated ROS generation, DNA damage and lipid oxidative damage \n\nduring irradiation. Oxidative damage to lipids was also enhanced in cells pre-treated \n\nwith copper and cobalt. Such observations are in accordance with the involvement of \n\niron in promoting the generation of the powerful oxidant hydroxyl radical through the \n\nFenton reaction (Buda et al., 2003). Copper can also participate in Haber-Weiss \n\nreactions that mediate the generation of the hydroxyl radical (Santo et al., 2011). \n\nPrevious investigations have reported altered expression of genes and proteins involved \n\nin iron influx and storage, as well as iron-containing enzymes, in bacteria exposed to \n\nUV radiation (Qiu et al., 2005a; Qiu et al., 2005b; Matallana-Surget et al., 2009a). The \n\n\n\nChapter 12 \n\n218 \n\npresent work indicates that metal homeostasis during irradiation might be important in \n\nlimiting oxidative stress associated with UVB exposure. \n\nAmendment of cell suspensions with manganese resulted in a statistically \n\nsignificant reduction in protein carbonyl levels during UVB exposure in all the strains \n\ntested, as well as a reduction in ROS levels. High levels of intracellular manganese have \n\nalso been shown to contribute for the resistance of bacteria to UVC radiation and \n\nionizing radiation by mitigating protein oxidation (Daly et al., 2004; Ghosh et al., 2011; \n\nGranger et al., 2011). This protective effect results from the replacement of the iron \n\npresent in the Fe-S clusters of enzymes by the Mn2+ ion, thereby preventing the \n\nformation of damaging hydroxyl radicals through the Fenton reaction (Anjem et al., \n\n2009). Additionally, Mn2+ is also capable of forming complexes with metabolites which \n\ncan scavenge superoxide, H2O2 and hydroxyl radicals (Daly et al., 2010).  \n\nSurprisingly, the protective effect of manganese against protein carbonylation \n\nand ROS levels was accompanied by a statistically significant reduction in survival \n\nduring exposure to UVB, compared to non-amended controls and, in three of the strains \n\ntested, a significant increase in DNA damage levels. The reason for this detrimental \n\neffect is unclear in the face of current knowledge, but some speculations can be made. \n\nFor example, the protective effect of Mn2+ is known to be dependent on the high \n\nexpression of antioxidant enzymes, particularly catalase (Schellhorn et al., 1998), but \n\nCAT can be inactivated by UVB (Zigman et al., 1996). This could have contributed for \n\nthe observed enhanced inactivation by UVB in the presence of manganese. On the other \n\nhand, it is possible that the Fe2+ that is displaced by Mn2+ in proteins could be able to \n\nparticipate in damage to DNA or lipids, thus overriding its protective effect against \n\nprotein carbonylation. \n\nTaken together, these results indicate that the toxicity of reactive oxygen species \n\ngenerated during UV exposure is mediated by intracellular metals and that metal \n\nhomeostasis is decisive in limiting the detrimental effects of ROS generated during \n\nUVB exposure in bacteria. The corollary following these observations is that enhanced \n\nmetal concentration in the environment might increase the sensitivity of bacteria to \n\nUVB-induced damage. Accordingly, photoreactions on cell surfaces have been \n\nproposed to contribute to the biological damage caused by copper in polluted \n\necosystems (Hayase and Zepp, 1991). \n\n\n\nChapter 12 \n\n219 \n\nFactors influencing UVB-induced inactivation and their mechanisms of interaction \n\nUV properties (wavelength, dose, mode of delivery), as well as environmental \n\n(temperature, salinity, nutrients) (Ogbebo and Ochs, 2008; Joux et al., 2009; Bullock \n\nand Jeffrey, 2010; Matallana-Surget et al., 2010) and biological (specific sensitivity, \n\nrepair mechanisms, nutritional state, growth phase) (Berney et al., 2006c; Bucheli-\n\nWitschel et al., 2010) factors, influence the effects of UV exposure on bacteria. \n\nIn the present work, the influence of different extrinsic and intrinsic factors on \n\nthe photobiological responses of bacteria was also studied. \n\nInfluence of nutrients and the suspension medium \n\nProperties associated with the medium in which bacterial cells are suspended for \n\nirradiations can influence their UV sensitivity by affecting bacterial physiology, \n\nphotodynamic reactions and/or light penetration through the medium (Muela et al., \n\n2002; Steinberger et al., 2002; Arana et al., 2004). \n\nIn the present work, the influence of nutrient concentration on the \n\nphotobiological responses of bacteria was studied by inoculating bacterial assemblages \n\nof different origins (bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton) in water containing different \n\nnutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) content (high and low). UV-induced inhibition was \n\ngenerally attenuated upon inoculation of bacterial communities in high nutrient \n\nmedium, compared to unamended conditions. Repair processes elicited in response to \n\nUVR require nitrogen for synthesis of proteins involved in DNA repair and ROS \n\nscavenging, and thus can potentially be inhibited by a limitation in nitrogen supply. \n\nThese repair processes are also energy-dependent, requiring ATP, and are consequently \n\nsusceptible to limitation in the supply of phosphorus (Beardall et al., 2009). The results \n\nobtained indicate that nutrient amendment potentially attenuates UV-induced inhibition \n\nof bacteria by providing the elements required for synthesis of proteins, including those \n\ninvolved in repair of UV-induced damage. These observations are in accordance with \n\nprevious work reporting the ability of nutrient inputs to promote recovery from UV-\n\ninduced damage in bacterioplankton (Pausz and Herndl, 2002; Joux et al., 2009).  \n\nThe influence of the quality of the suspension medium on the UV-sensitivity \n\nresponses of bacterial communities was studied by inoculating bacterioneuston and \n\nbacterioplankton samples of marine and brackish origin in cell-free water of different \n\norigin (surface and subsurface of marine and brackish origin). Their photobiological \n\n\n\nChapter 12 \n\n220 \n\nresponses in terms of culturable numbers and activity (leucine incorporation) were \n\ndetermined and compared to those observed upon inoculation in an artificial mineral \n\nsolution (AMS).  \n\nIn general, inoculation of bacterial communities in SML and UW water \n\nattenuated the inhibitory effects of radiation, compared to those observed upon \n\ninoculation in AMS. The UV protective effect of inoculation of bacterial communities \n\nin SML and/or UW compared to the AMS treatment can be attributed to stimulation of \n\nbacterial metabolism by low molecular weight compounds resulting from the photolytic \n\ncleavage of DOM present in the natural samples (Amador et al., 1989; Bushaw et al., \n\n1996; Moran and Zepp, 1997; Bertilsson and Tranvik, 1998; Obernosterer et al., 1999) \n\nwhich could have compensated for the direct negative effects of irradiation. On the \n\nother hand, DOC present in the environmental samples can also exert a shield and \n\nquenching effect (Muela et al., 2000; Bracchini et al., 2005) that might have contributed \n\nto mitigate the detrimental effects of irradiation in samples diluted in SML and/or UW, \n\ncompared to samples in AMS. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the media \n\nin which bacteria are suspended for irradiations influence the biological effects of UV \n\nradiation, thus pointing to the importance of the SML and UW abiotic environment in \n\ndetermining the UV responses of the corresponding bacterial communities. \n\nInfluence of light dose and growth conditions \n\nIn order to test the influence of growth conditions in UV-induced oxidative \n\ndamage, a representative estuarine bacterial strain was grown to the mid-exponential, \n\nlate-exponential or stationary phase at 15 \u00baC or 25 \u00baC under nutrient-rich (TSB) or \n\nnutrient-poor (M9 medium) conditions and irradiated up to a cumulative dose of 60 kJ \n\nm-2. Cell numbers and markers of oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation, protein \n\ncarbonylation, DNA strand breaks and DNA-protein cross-links) during irradiation were \n\nmonitored.  \n\nIn general, oxidative damage only followed a linear dose-dependence for low \n\nUVB doses (? 10 kJ m-2), suggesting that oxidative damage levels during irradiation \n\nresult from a dynamic interaction between damage induction and repair. Another \n\npossibility is that, at high UVB doses, there is a saturation of oxidative damage as a \n\nresult of consecutive molecule excitation by high UV fluences, which gives rise to a \n\ncomplex, non-linear dependence of oxidative damage on the irradiation dose (Byeong et \n\nal., 2007). \n\n\n\nChapter 12 \n\n221 \n\nStationary phase cells generally survived better and showed lower levels of \n\noxidative damage than exponential phase cells, particularly at low and intermediate \n\nUVB doses. Enhanced survival of stationary phase cells to several stress factors has \n\nbeen attributed to the role of the alternative sigma factor RpoS or ?38, encoded by the \n\nrpoS gene, that is active in the stationary phase of many bacteria and induces a number \n\nof mechanisms that ensure resistance to environmental stress (Loewen and Hengge-\n\nAronis, 1994; Chen et al., 1996; Schellhorn et al., 1998; Hengge-Aronis, 1999).  \n\nMid-exponential phase cells grown at 15 \u00baC survived better to UVB exposure \n\nand showed lower levels of oxidative damage than cells grown at 25 \u00baC, particularly at \n\nlow UVB doses. These results suggest a potential temperature effect on ROS generation \n\nand/or ROS interaction with the cellular targets. UV-induced DNA damage, assessed by \n\nCPD and/or 6-4 PP quantification, was previously found to be enhanced at higher \n\ntemperatures (Takeuchi et al., 1996; Waterworth et al., 2002; Li et al., 2004; Matallana-\n\nSurget et al., 2010). A possible influence of temperature on the conformational state of \n\nDNA (Li et al., 2002) and/or an indirect influence of temperature on DNA lesions, by \n\naffecting DNA-binding proteins (Matallana-Surget et al., 2010), could contribute for \n\nsuch a temperature trend. Furthermore, it is also possible that the chemical reactions \n\ninvolved in the interaction of ROS with their targets might be temperature-dependent \n\n(Li et al., 2002). The electron transport chain is a major source of ROS in the cell (Imlay \n\nand Fridovich, 1991; Gonz\u00e1lez-Flecha and Demple, 1995). It is possible that, by \n\nreducing oxygen consumption, lower temperatures might attenuate ROS production and \n\nthe risk of oxidative damage (Borgeraas and Hessen, 2000).  \n\nCells cultivated in nutrient-rich TSB generally survived better to medium-high \n\nUVB doses (> 10 kJ m-2) than those grown in nutrient-poor M9 medium. Nutrient-rich \n\nTSB, but not M9, could possibly have provided sufficient amounts of the chemical \n\nelements required for the synthesis of macromolecules necessary to withstand high \n\nUVB doses (e.g., enzymes involved in DNA repair and ROS scavenging), thus \n\naccounting for the enhanced UVB resistance of cells grown in TSB. These results are \n\nconsistent with the enhanced UVB resistance of a set of bacterial isolates in nourished \n\nconditions, compared to their starved counterparts (Santos et al., 2012a), and enhanced \n\nUVB resistance of bacterioplankton and bacterioneuston upon amendment with high \n\nnutrient concentrations (Chapter 9). \n\n\n\nChapter 12 \n\n222 \n\nThese results reveal that growth conditions preceding irradiation are important \n\ndeterminants of survival and oxidative damage imposed by UVB exposure, potentially \n\nby affecting the temporal progression and the magnitude of biomolecule damage.  \n\n \n\nThe role of RecA as an indicator of UV repair potential \n\nThe RecA protein is the primary regulator of dark repair mechanisms in bacteria \n\n(Miller and Kokjohn, 1990). Because the recA gene is itself regulated as part of the SOS \n\ngene expression system, measurement of the concentration of RecA protein in the cell \n\nallows monitoring of its repair capacity. Accordingly, RecA levels have been proposed \n\nas a barometer of the repair potential of bacterial isolates and communities in response \n\nto incident solar UV radiation (Booth et al., 2001a; Booth et al., 2001b). Transcriptomic \n\nand proteomics studies have supported the potential role of RecA as a biomarker of UV-\n\ninduced damage (Courcelle et al., 2001; Qiu et al., 2005a; Qiu et al., 2005b; Berney et \n\nal., 2006a; Moeller et al., 2007b; Matallana-Surget et al., 2012).  \n\nEvidences suggest that structural or kinetic properties of RecA are also related to \n\nspecific requirements of DNA damage repair systems in some species. For example, the \n\nRecA of the radiation-resistant Deinococcus radiodurans and that of E. coli show \n\ndifferences in terms of orientation and composition of the C-terminal domain involved \n\nin binding double-stranded DNA (Rajan and Bell, 2004). These observations raise the \n\nhypothesis that the ability to cope with DNA damage, particularly that induced by UV \n\nradiation, during the life history of microorganisms could be reflected in RecA \n\nphylogeny and/or in the number of its gene copies in the genome. \n\nIn the present work, it was investigated whether RecA phylogeny and recA \n\nfrequency among fully sequenced genomes could reflect an adaptation to cope with UV-\n\ninduced damage. Phylogenetic analysis of the RecA protein was, in general, coherent \n\nwith the phyla defined by 16S rRNA gene analysis, demonstrating the high degree of \n\nconservation of RecA resulting from its fundamental housekeeping role in bacteria. \n\nDuplication of the recA gene was found to be widespread among myxobacteria \n\n(Deltaproteobacteria) and some Firmicutes members. Earlier work by Karlin et al. \n\n(1995) suggested that the presence of two recA genes in the myxobacteria Myxococcus \n\nxanthus could provide higher amounts of the RecA repair protein that would allow this \n\ntopsoil bacteria to withstand UV irradiation. However, our observations of the \n\nwidespread duplication of recA in myxobacteria inhabiting various environments \n\n\n\nChapter 12 \n\n223 \n\nsuggest that UV radiation is not the only factor underlying the presence of additional \n\ncopies of the recA gene. \n\nDuplication of the recA gene was also detected in several Firmicutes members. \n\nIn Bacillus megaterium, both recA copies seem to be functional, and the second recA \n\ncopy is known to complement the loss of recA1 in terms of UV sensitivity (Nahrstedt et \n\nal., 2005). The authors suggested that a greater amount of RecA might increase the \n\ncapacity of the cell for recombinational repair. Whether this is applicable to the other \n\nFirmicutes members in which recA duplication was observed, is unknown.  \n\nSeveral new cases of plasmids encoding the recA gene that had not been \n\npreviously reported in the literature were also identified by database mining. The \n\npresence of two recA (recAP1 and recAP3) in two different plasmids in Deinococcus \n\ndeserti, in addition to the chromosomal recA, was proposed to provide higher levels of \n\nRecA protein for efficient error-free repair of DNA damage (Dulermo et al., 2009). In \n\nthe present work, in some of the plasmids the presence of a gene coding for DNA \n\npolymerase V subunit, which performs translesion DNA synthesis during the SOS \n\nresponse, immediately after the recA gene was observed. This could suggest that the \n\nplasmid-encoded recA copy might fulfil a role in complementing the chromosomal recA \n\nin the SOS response, including during the response to UV exposure. However, further \n\nstudies are necessary to clarify whether the newly detected plasmid-encoded RecA \n\nproteins are actually functional and can, in fact, complement the chromosomal RecA in \n\nthe SOS response. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n224 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nP\u00c1GINA INTENCIONALMENTE DEIXADA EM BRANCO \n\n\n\nChapter 13 \n\n225 \n\nCHAPTER 13 \n\nGENERAL CONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\nThe results of this thesis indicate that: \n\n- The light history of bacterial communities influences their UV sensitivity. \n\nResults from community assays comparing the responses of bacterioneuston and \n\nbacterioplankton to UVB radiation revealed that bacterial abundance and DNA \n\nsynthesis were more affected in bacterioplankton, while protein synthesis was \n\nmore inhibited in bacterioneuston. UVB exposure seemed to select for UV-\n\nresistant Gammaproteobacteria, particularly abundant in bacterioneuston. \n\nEnhanced resistance of bacterioneuston to UVB radiation, in terms of \n\nabundance, was confirmed in investigations conducted with isolated bacterial \n\nstrains. Furthermore, UVB irradiation was also found to be accompanied by a \n\nshift in sole-carbon source use profiles in bacterial isolates. Recovery from \n\nUVB-induced stress was enhanced in bacterioneuston, particularly under \n\nnutrient-depleted conditions. These results suggest that bacterioneuston may \n\ncontain a pool of UV-resistant strains that, under appropriate meteorological \n\nconditions, may be selected upon UV exposure.  \n\n- DNA damage, oxidative damage to lipids, and intracellular ROS levels \n\naccount for bacterial inactivation under UVA, UVB and UVC wavelengths. \n\nUsing a combination of several UV-sensitivity tests and their statistical analysis, \n\napplied to a range of bacteria, new information regarding the process of UV-\n\nbased inactivation was gained. Mid-infrared spectroscopy revealed an array of \n\nmodifications in the lipids and proteins of bacteria following irradiation. These \n\nresults provide new insights into the targets of different UV wavelengths in \n\nbacterial cells, as well as clues to the underlying common mechanisms involved \n\nin the inactivation of different bacteria. This information can contribute for a \n\nbetter understanding of the environmental effects of UV radiation and allow the \n\noptimization of UV-based disinfection strategies. \n\n- Singlet oxygen is pivotal in UVB-induced cell inactivation. Using specific \n\nROS scavengers, singlet oxygen was also found to be important in lipid \n\nperoxidation. The hydroxyl radical was found to participate in DNA strand \n\nbreakage and protein carbonylation, while the impairment of glucose \n\n\n\nChapter 13 \n\n226 \n\nincorporation and respiration during UVB exposure had a contribution of \n\nhydrogen peroxide and superoxide.  \n\n- Metal amendment, particularly iron, copper and manganese, enhances \n\nbacterial inactivation during UVB exposure. Amendment with iron \n\nexacerbated ROS generation, DNA damage and lipid peroxidation during \n\nirradiation. Copper and cobalt also enhanced lipid peroxidation. Despite \n\nattenuating the formation of protein carbonyls during irradiation, manganese \n\namendment decreased bacterial survival. These results indicate that iron, copper, \n\ncobalt and manganese play a role in UVB-induced inactivation and that metal \n\nhomeostasis is crucial in limiting the detrimental effects of ROS generated \n\nduring UVB exposure. \n\n- The abiotic environment (nutrient content and quality of the suspension \n\nmedium) influences the UVB sensitivity of bacterial communities. In general, \n\ninoculation of bacterial communities in high nutrient medium attenuated UVB-\n\ninduced inhibition of abundance and activity, compared to unamended \n\nconditions. Suspension in natural water resulted in less pronounced inhibitory \n\neffects of UVB exposure, compared to suspensions prepared in an artificial \n\nmineral solution. \n\n- Growth conditions preceding irradiation are crucial to the extent of the \n\noxidative damage induced by UVB exposure. In general, stationary phase \n\ncells survived better and showed lower levels of protein carbonyls than \n\nexponential phase cells. Oxidative damage to biomolecules was generally higher \n\nat 25 \u00baC than at 15 \u00baC, particularly in mid-exponential phase cells, pointing to a \n\ntemperature effect on ROS generation and/or ROS interaction with the cellular \n\ntargets. Growth conditions seemed to affect UVB sensitivity by influencing the \n\ntemporal progression and the magnitude of the damage to biomolecules. \n\n- RecA phylogeny reflects the high degree of conservation of the protein, \n\nrather than particular adaptations to withstand stressful conditions. \n\nDuplication of the recA gene was found to be widespread in myxobacteria and \n\nalso frequent among Firmicutes. Several plasmids containing recA homologs not \n\nyet reported in the literature were identified. Gene context analysis suggested \n\nthat plasmid-encoded recA genes could complement the activity of \n\nchromosome-encoded recA genes in the bacterial SOS response. \n\n\n\nReferences \n\n227 \n\nREFERENCES\n \n\nAas, P., Lyons, M.
