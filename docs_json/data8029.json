This basin is a densely populated area with \na substantial number of industries, especially metallurgy, electroplating works, steel mills, petrochemicals, \nand tanneries. The total metal concentrations were determined by X-ray fluorescence and the sediment \nphase concentrations were determined by applying the BCR-701 sequential extraction method proposed by \nthe Community Bureau of Reference of the European Community, using ICP/OES. The contents extracted \nby a solution of 0.5 mol/L HCl were also considered. Metal contents were evaluated in the sediment \nfraction&lt;63 \u00b5m. Results in the industrialized and densely populated region showed an increase in the \ntotal concentrations of Cu, Cr, Zn, and Pb, and in the potentially mobile fractions for Cu, Cr, Zn and Ni \nsequentially extracted. Cr stood out particularly in the Port\u00e3o stream, showing 1,286 mg/kg as a result of \nthe total concentration, considering the tannery region influence.\n\nKey words: BCR-701, metals, sediment, sequential extraction.\n\nCorrespondence to: Ismael Lu\u00eds Schneider\nE-mail: ismaelquimrs@yahoo.com.br\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMetals are one of the most common pollutants in \naquatic environments and may be originated from \nnatural sources, from geological weathering or \nanthropogenic sources, such as industrial, agri-\ncultural, urban and domestic effluents (Hang et \nal. 2009, Davutluoglu et al. 2011). Metals when \ndispersed in aquatic environments tend to deposit \nin the sediments, which have high retention \ncapacity and the potential of release these pollutants \n(Salomons and Stigliani 1995, Passos et al. 2011). \n\nThis release into the overlying water column may \noccur by changes in environmental conditions such \nas pH, redox potential, bioturbation and organic \nmatter decomposition (F\u00f6rstner and Kersten \n1989, Davutluoglu et al. 2011). Nevertheless, the \nsediments act as reservoirs of metals, providing a \nreasonably accurate history of the pollution of the \nriver (Sakai et al. 1986, Filgueiras et al. 2002, Hang \net al. 2009, Davutluoglu et al. 2011).\n\nHowever, the determination in metal total \nconcentration in sediments is not a particularly \ngood indicator when one looks for a distinction \nbetween natural and anthropogenic contributions \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0001-3765201420130137\n\n1043-1061\n\n\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2014) 86 (3)\n\n1044 ISMAEL L. SCHNEIDER, ELBA C. TEIXEIRA, MARIA LUCIA K. RODRIGUES and SILVIA B.A. ROLIM\n\n(Quevauviller et al. 1996, Relic et al. 2010, Passos \net al. 2011, Okoro et al. 2012). Thus, recent studies \nhave used sequential extraction procedures to under-\nstand the specific chemical associations with sedi-\nmentary phases and metal sources (Rodrigues and \nFormoso 2006, Hang et al. 2009, Davutluoglu et \nal. 2011). Many of these are variants on the scheme \nproposed by Tessier et al. (1979). These procedures \nuse selective reagents to consecutively extract \n\"operationally defined phases\" from the sediments, \nallowing for the quantification of the levels of \npotentially mobile metals and the establishment \nof associations with anthropogenic contributions \n(Rauret et al. 1999, Larner et al. 2008). Thus, \nalterations in the environmental conditions are \nsimulated, enabling the prediction of the impact \nof a potential mobilization of metals on the \nsurrounding environment (Bacon and Davidson \n2008). The quantification of potentially mobile \nmetals can also be done by simple extraction \ntechniques (Gleyzes et al. 2002).\n\nCurrently, one technique often used is the \nsequential extraction procedure proposed by the \nCommunity Bureau of Reference (BCR) (now called \nStandards, Measurement and Testing Programme). \nThis procedure was developed in order to solve the \nlack of sequential extraction procedure uniformity. \nBesides that, it provides a corresponding certified \nreference material and gives a method validation \nand a way of comparing the data generated (L\u00f3pez-\nS\u00e1nchez et al. 1998, Rauret et al. 1999). This tech-\nnique involves three steps \u2013 exchangeable metals \nassociated with carbonates, reducible metals, and \noxidizable metals (Quevauviller et al. 1996, Rauret \n1998, Davidson et al. 1999, Pueyo et al. 2001, \nTeixeira et al. 2003, Rodrigues and Formoso 2006, \nBoughriet et al. 2007, Davutluoglu et al. 2011, \nPassos et al. 2011, Dundar et al. 2012).\n\nSome problems have not yet been fully resol-\nved in the use of sequential extractions, such as redis-\ntribution of analytes between the geochemical phases, \nlack of reagent selectivity, incomplete extraction \n\nand precipitation of new mineral phases during the \nextraction. Even so, the increasing use of such \nschemes in the evaluation of metals in sediments has \nshown the usefulness of the information obtained, \nwhich many times corresponds to observable environ-\nmental effects, such as the decrease in local biodiversity \n(Rauret et al. 1999, Juli\u00e1n and Collado 2002, Bacon \nand Davidson 2008, Rodrigues et al. 2008).\n\nOn the other hand, to evaluate the potentially \nmobile metals, cold acid extraction procedures may \nalso be used, which tries to simulate the natural \nremoval processes of these more \"reactive\" elements of \nthe sediments (Bevilacqua et al. 2009). The extraction \nprocedure with diluted hydrochloric acid (HCl) has \nbeen frequently applied (Sutherland and Tack 2008, \nBevilacqua et al. 2009, Li et al. 2009) and can be \nused as a first evaluation technique for monitoring the \npotential contamination by metals. Then, high levels \nidentified by the extraction with HCl may be subject \nto further assessment, using sequential extraction \nprocedures (Sutherland and Tack 2008).\n\nSinos River basin is located in an industria-\nlized and densely populated area, where there are \nmetallurgical industries, electroplating works, steel \nmills, petrochemicals and tanneries, liquid waste \ngenerators with metals. Even though sediment \ncontamination is currently one of the most serious \nproblems in basin environmental management, \nfinding solutions for these problems is still poor. \nRobaina et al. (2002) and Oliveira et al. (2008) have \nstudies that show an intense metal contamination in \nthe lower Sinos River.\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the \ngeochemical distribution and potential mobility of \nsome metals (Cu, Cr, Ni, Zn, Pb, Mn, Al, and Fe) \nin sediments along the Sinos River basin. These \nmetals were selected because they indicate the \nindustrial liquid waste markers which are located \nin the study area especially in the metallurgical/\nelectroplanting and tannery sectors (Cu, Zn, Ni, Pb \nand Cr), as well as natural components in the area \n(such as Mn, Al and Fe).\n\n\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2014) 86 (3)\n\n1045METAL CONTENT AND DISTRIBUTION IN SURFACE SEDIMENT\n\nSTUDY AREA\n\nSinos River basin is located in the northeast of the \nstate of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, with an extension \nof 3,820 km2 crossing almost 29 counties, of which \n21 are within the Porto Alegre Metropolitan Area, \nthe capital of the state (see Fig. 1). It is bounded to \nthe east by the Serra Geral, to the west and north \nby the Ca\u00ed River basin, and to the south by the \nGravata\u00ed River basin. Sinos River has its source \n\nat an altitude of 600 m, its main course flows is \n190 km and it finally discharges at an altitude of \n12 m. About 1.3 million people inhabit its basin \n(Comitesinos 2009), representing 13% of the total \npopulation of the state concentrated in only 3.5% \nof its territory. The climate is subtropical with an \nannual average temperature of around 20\u00b0C and \nabout 1,600 mm of rain annually, well-distributed \nover the four seasons (FEPAM 2006).\n\nFig. 1 - Study area with the sampling sites in the Sinos River basin.\n\nThe basin can be divided into three different \nregions, all of which related to the corresponding \nsection of the river: upper, middle, and lower. In \nthe upper part, characterized by a more rugged \nterrain and by agricultural activities in small farms, \nwe selected two sampling sites (Table I). This part \n\nof the Sinos River, about 25 km long, has high \ndeclivity, with altitudes ranging between 600 m and \n60 m. In the middle section of the basin, with about \n125 km, the declivity of the Sinos River decreases, \nand we chose one sampling site (Table I). As one \nmoves downstream, the population density and \n\n\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2014) 86 (3)\n\n1046 ISMAEL L. SCHNEIDER, ELBA C. TEIXEIRA, MARIA LUCIA K.

Presently, industrial activity (especially \nmetallurgy, electroplating works, steel mills, petro-\nchemicals and tanneries), domestic sewage, and \nrice farming are the main sources of concern with \nregard to water quality of this river basin (FEPAM \n2006). The lower stretch of the Sinos River has, \nas major tributaries, streams that drain large urban \ncenters, such as the Luiz Rau and the Port\u00e3o streams. \nBesides choosing sampling sites near the mouth of \nthese streams, we also selected six additional sites \nalong the main course of the Sinos River (Table I). \nThe codes of the locations indicate the distance in \nkilometers from the sampling location to the mouth \nof the Sinos River.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nCOLLECTION AND PREPARATION OF SAMPLES\n\nSediment samples were collected between February \nand August 2010, at eight locations along the main \ncourse of the Sinos River and three tributaries \n(Rolante River and the mouths of Luiz Rau and \nPort\u00e3o streams). Samples of surface sediments \nwere collected by using a PVC, L-shaped manual \ncollector. The material collected was stored \nin plastic bags, cooled to 4\u00b0C and sent to the \nlaboratory, where the fraction with particle size \n<63 \u00b5m was separated by means of wet sieving. \nThis procedure was performed on the same day \n\nof sampling, thereby to minimize the action of \nmicroorganisms in migration processes and avoid \nmetals redistribution. The interest content was oven-\ndried at 37\u00b0C and was then finely homogenized in \nan agate mortar.\n\nCHEMICAL ANALYSES\n\nTotal metal concentration\n\nTo evaluate the total metal concentrations, the \nsediment samples were prepared as compressed \npellets and analyzed in a sequential X-ray \nfluorescence spectrometer (PW2404, Philips), \nequipped with a rhodium tube. The analysis \nwas performed at the Analytical Geochemistry \nLaboratory at Campinas University.\n\nSequential extraction\n\nThe fractional metal concentrations in the geoche-\nmical phases of the sediments was carried out \naccording to the sequential extraction method \nproposed by the BCR (now Standards, Measurement \nand Testing Programme) (Pueyo et al. 2001, \nTeixeira et al. 2003, Rodrigues and Formoso 2006, \nDavutluoglu et al. 2011, Passos et al. 2011, Dundar \net al. 2012). The procedure is explained in Table II. \nThe quantification of metallic cations in solution \nwas performed in an inductively coupled plasma \noptical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) at the \nSoils Laboratory of the Federal University of Rio \nGrande do Sul. In this study, the fourth stage, \ncorresponding to the metal residual fraction, was \ndetermined by the difference between the sum of \nthe three sequentially extracted stages in relation to \nthe total content of the metal under study, previously \nobtained by X-ray fluorescence.\n\nExtraction with 0.5 mol/L HCl\n\nThe analysis of potentially mobile metals extracted \nwith a solution of 0.5 mol/L HCl was performed as \nrecommended by Sutherland (2002) and Sutherland \nand Tack (2007, 2008).

The suspension obtained \nwas filtered through cellulose ester filter of 0.20 \nmm porosity prior to quantification of Cu, Cr, Ni, \nPb, and Zn, certified for the reference material \nBCR-701. The quantification of metallic cations \nin solution was performed in an ICP-OES at the \nSoils Laboratory of the Federal University of Rio \nGrande do Sul. Subsequently, the contents extracted \nby 0.5 mol/L HCl solution and those by sequential \nextraction were correlated by regressions.\n\nGENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SEDIMENTS\n\nTotal sulfur (S) was determined by X-ray fluorescence \nand corresponds to indicative values. Organic matter \nwas obtained by the loss of mass by ignition (2 h at \n360\u00b0C) (Schulte and Hopkins 1996). The analysis \nof particle size was performed in the laboratory \nof the Center for Coastal Studies (CECO) of the \nFederal University of Rio Grande do Sul and \nit involved the separation of the main textural \nclasses of sediments by sieving and sedimentation \ntechniques. The clay minerals were also analyzed \nat the CECO, after preparation of slides with the \noriented clay minerals. The slides were air-dried, \nsolvated with ethylene glycol and calcinated, and \nwere then successively analyzed by an X-ray \ndiffractometer in the range of between 2? 2-28 \u00b0, \nby using CuK? radiation.\n\nACCURACY OF THE CHEMICAL ANALYSIS\n\nTo assess the accuracy of the total metals con-\ncentrations, two soil reference materials were used \n(GSS-2 and GSS-5, China), showing mean recoveries \nfrom 88 to 105% for Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, MnO, Al2O3, \nand Fe2O3. The metal concentrations determination \nin the reference material was performed in duplicate, \nwith coefficients of variation&lt;10%. The detection \nlimits (DL) for Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn were 3, 2, 2, \n3 and 2 mg/kg, respectively.\n\nOne certified sediment reference material \n(BCR-701) was analyzed to determine the accuracy \nof the sequential extraction procedure described \nabove. The certified and analyzed values and their \nrecoveries at each extraction step were calculated \nwith mean recoveries from 85 to 104% for Cr, \nCu, Ni, Pb, and Zn. The analyses of this certified \nreference material were performed in triplicate \nand of the sediment samples in duplicate, showing \ncoefficients of variation&lt;10%. The detection limits \n(DL) for Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn were 0.4, 0.6, 0.4, \n2.0 and 2.0 mg/kg, respectively.\n\nFor the extraction procedure with a solution of \n0.5 mol/L HCl, one of the samples was spiked with \na known amount of each metal evaluated (Cr, Cu, \nNi, Pb and Zn) and then analyzed in triplicate, with \naverage recoveries of 91-97%. The determination \nof metal concentrations in the sediment samples \nwas performed in duplicate, with coefficients of \n\n\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2014) 86 (3)\n\n1048 ISMAEL L. SCHNEIDER, ELBA C.

The detection limits (DL) for Cr, \nCu, Ni, Pb and Zn were 0.4, 0.6, 0.4, 2.0 and 2.0 \nmg/kg, respectively.\n\nSEDIMENT QUALITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe total concentrations of metal in the Sinos \nRiver basin sediments were compared with the \nspecific literature: taking the studied background \nconcentrations (Robaina et al. 2002), average \nshale (Turekian and Wedepohl 1961), and other \nmetals levels in rivers around the globe (Irabien \nand Velasco 1999, Rodrigues and Formoso 2006, \nBoughriet et al. 2007, Li et al. 2009, Davutluoglu \net al. 2011, Hang et al. 2009, Rangel et al. 2011, \nDundar et al. 2012).\n\nTo assess the ecotoxicological implications \nof total metal concentrations in sediments, we \nconsidered sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) as: \nthe indices established by the Canadian Council of \nMinisters of the Environment (CCME 1999) and \nthe study of Long et al. (1995).\n\nLong et al. (1995) define two sets: i) effects \nrange low (ERL)/effects range median (ERM) \nand ii) the threshold effects level (TEL)/probable \neffects level (PEL). ERL and TEL indices refer to \nconcentrations below which adverse effects on the \nwildlife in the sediment are unlikely and which \nwould be expected only infrequently. In contrast, \nadverse effects are more likely to occur when \nmetal concentrations are above ERM and PEL. \nThe Canadian study reports the indices interim \nfreshwater sediment quality guideline (ISQG) and \nprobable effects level (PEL).\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) was applied \nto the set of variables in the sediments in order \nto estimate potential emission sources. Chemical \nvariables used in PCA were selected based on the \nPearson correlation matrix, giving rise to a set of \nsynthetic variables (principal components) based \non the interrelationships of the original data. The \n\nprincipal components selected were those that \nobtained characteristic roots >1.0 after applying the \nVarimax rotation. The primary function of the PCA \nis a decrease in the number of variables while retai-\nning the original information as much as possible, \nand thus variables with similar characteristics can \nbe grouped into factors. PCA was analyzed by using \nWindows SPSS version 20.0.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nGENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SEDIMENTS\n\nTable III shows the general characteristics of the \nsediments. The highest sulfur levels (S) were found \nat the sites near the mouth of the Sinos River (SI \n019 and SI 008) and the Port\u00e3o stream, while the \nhighest organic matter (OM) were found at sites SI \n188 (16.8%) and Port\u00e3o stream (15.8%). The high \nOM content observed at the source of the Sinos \nRiver (SI 188) can be attributed to the influence of \nwell-preserved vegetation of the river margins. \nAt the same place a high content of sulfur was \nalso noticed, which may be locally released during \norganic matter decomposition (Neue and Mamaril \n1985). The OM is considered a metal geochemical \ncarrier in some types of environments due to its \ncapacity of absorbing and complexing metals of \nboth terrestrial and marine origins (Salomons and \nF\u00f6rstner 1984, Warren and Haack 2001).\n\nSinos River sediment grain is composed by \ngravel (from 0% to 75%), sand (from 16% to 98%), \nsilt (from 1% to 62%) and clay (from 1% to 20%).  \nThe coarse sediments were found at sites SI 188 and \nRolante River, in the upper part of the river basin, \nindicating its proximity to the bedrock. The texture \nof the sediments (Table III) was predominantly \nsand, except for site SI 028, which showed 61.7% \nof silt. According to Laybauer and Bidone (2001), \nat sites with a greater incidence of smaller particle \nsizes, which have an increase in the superficial area \nand the capacity of the cations exchange, there \nwill be a tendency of metal accumulation in the \n\n\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2014) 86 (3)\n\n1049METAL CONTENT AND DISTRIBUTION IN SURFACE SEDIMENT\n\nSite\nParticle size fraction (%) Particle size \n\nclassification S (mg/kg) OM (%) Clay mineralsgravel sand silt clay\nSI 188 75.0 16.2 7.7 1.0 gravel and sand 764 16.8 smectite, illite, quartz, zeolite\n\nRolante river 12.8 84.6 1.9 0.8 sand 394 10.6 kaolinite, smectite, illite, k-feldspar, quartz\n\nSI 096 0.0 48.8 34.5 16.7 mud with sand 224 8.7 kaolinite, smectite, k-feldspar, quartz\n\nSI 066 0.0 46.0 41.6 12.4 mud with sand 511 12.1 kaolinite, smectite, k-feldspar, quartz\nLuiz Rau stream 0.0 75.8 15.3 8.9 sand 267 11.1 kaolinite, smectite, illite, quartz\n\nSI 048 0.0 71.3 19.5 9.2 sand with mud 286 10.0 kaolinite, smectite, k-feldspar, quartz\nPort\u00e3o stream 0.0 98.3 0.6 1.1 sand 922 15.8 barite, kaolinite smectite, quartz\n\nSI 036 0.0 92.7 4.6 2.7 sand 637 9.8 kaolinite, smectite, illite, k-feldspar, quartz\nSI 028 0.0 18.0 61.7 20.3 mud 729 11.5 kaolinite, smectite, quartz\n\nSI 019 0.0 66.1 25.4 8.5 sand with mud 1301 12.0 kaolinite, smectite, k-feldspar, quartz\nSI 008 0.0 52.2 37.4 10.3 sand with mud 1205 11.5 kaolinite, smectite, illite, quartz\n\nTABLE III\nAdditional parameters used for characterizing \nsediment samples from the Sinos River basin.\n\nsediments.

According to \nRodrigues and Formoso (2006), sediments con-\ntaining smectite (expansive clays of high cation \nexchange capacity) can retain metals, which are \nsubject to remobilization under changes in environ-\nmental conditions. Furthermore, illite, zeolite, \nK-feldspar, and barite were also identified. These \nminerals were probably formed by alteration of \nvolcanic rocks of the Serra Geral Formation and \nsandstones of the Botucatu Formation (Oliveira et \nal. 2008).\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS\n\nTable V shows the factorial weight matrix obtained \nfrom total metals concentrations in sediments from \nthe Sinos River basin sampling. Factor analysis \nperformed with the variables explained 43.2% for \n\nFactor 1, 22.9% for Factor 2 and 18.8% for Factor 3 \nof total variance. These three factors explain 84.9% \nof the total variance of the data.\n\nFactor 1 explained 43.2% of the total variance of \nthe data and had positive loadings on Cu (0.813), Pb \n(0.923), Zn (0.704) and Al (0.869). This factor shows \nthese metals are from electroplating industries in \nwhich these metals are used in deposition processes \nand beyond aesthetic reasons, where they work in \nabrasion resistance and corrosion. According to \nFactor 1, Mn (-0.763), Fe (-0.742) and Ni (-0.636) \nshow negative loadings and its main reason is the \nmetallurgical and steel industries. These industries \nuse Mn-Fe-Ni alloys in their production processes. \nAbout 70 industries are located in the Sinos River \nbasin, and are classified into basic metallurgy and \nthey may be responsible for the heavy metals found \nin Factor 1.\n\nFactor 2 explained 22.9% of the total variance, \nshowing loadings on Cr (0.977) and OM (0.658) that \nmight be identified as originating from tanneries in \nthe Sinos River basin. Other papers have reported \nCr to OM association (Rodrigues and Formoso \n\n\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2014) 86 (3)\n\n1050 ISMAEL L. SCHNEIDER, ELBA C. TEIXEIRA, MARIA LUCIA K.

This \nassociation is based on the sequential extraction, \nwhere Cr is associated to step 3 (sulfides/OM).\n\nFactor 3 explained 18.8% of total variance, \nwith positive loadings on Zn (0.658) and S (0.952). \nThis leads to Zn labor in the oxidizable fraction \n(step 3) of the sequential extraction procedure such \nas sulfides, further analyzed in this paper.\n\nTOTAL CONTENTS AND METAL FRACTIONATION\n\nTable IV shows the results of metal concentrations \nin sediments (fraction&lt;63 \u00b5m, dry weight) of the \nSinos River and its tributaries and Fig. 2 shows \nthe percentage distribution of the selected metals \nin the four geochemical sediment phases. The \naverage potential availability in relation to total \nmetal content, as measured by the sum of the three \nmobile phases of the BCR sequential procedure, \nshowed some differences between the river basin \nsubdivisions. In the upper stretch, the following \nmetal sequence bioavailability was observed: Mn \n(71%) > Pb (54%) > Zn (26%) > Cr (13%) > Cu \n(12%) > Ni (11%) > Fe (9%) > Al (5%). For the \nmiddle stretch, the sequence was Mn (43%) > Pb \n(42%) > Cu (14%) > Zn (13%) > Cr (12%) > Ni \n(8%) > Fe (5%) > Al (4%). For the lower stretch, \nthe sequence was Mn (76%) > Zn (65%) > Pb \n(51%) > Cr (46%) > Ni (45%) > Cu (41%) > Fe \n(17%) > Al (4%). Some differences were observed \nin the sequence of mobility potential in the three \nparts of the river basin, so that in the lower part, \nwhich shows a higher concentration of industries \nand habitants, there is an increase in potentially \nmobile fractions of Zn, Cr, Ni, Cu, and Fe.\n\nFe and Al showed high percentages in the \nresidual phase (Fig. 2) in all basin samples, \nindicating that these elements have a low mobility \nin the environment where they are and that they are \nlittle affected by human activity (Li et al. 2009). \nThe presence of the minerals kaolinite, smectite, \nillite, quartz (Table III) and hematite (Oliveira et al. \n2008) endorse these elements in the residual stage.\n\nCu total concentrations (Table IV) varied from \n69 to 121 mg/kg, and the maximum values were \nfound in the Luiz Rau stream, followed by sites \nfrom the point SI 028 onwards. As for the potential \nmobility (Fig. 2), there is an increase onwards site SI \n066, located at the beginning of the lower part of the \nbasin. The most affected site is the Luiz Rau stream \n(121 mg/kg), where the potentially mobile phases \nreached 62% of the total content. This stream receives \nall discharges from one of the main urban centers and \naround its site there are electroplating, metallurgical \nand chemical industries. Cu was extracted mainly \nin reducible (1-24%) and oxidized (6-29%) fractions \nof the sequential extraction procedure, according to \nresults from other studies that evaluated urban and \nindustrial influences (Davidson et al. 1994, Kubov\u00e1 et \nal. 2008, Davidson et al. 2006, Rodrigues and Formoso \n2006, Hang et al. 2009, Li et al. 2009, Vymazal et al. \n2010, Davutluoglu et al. 2011). In addition, a high \npercentage in the exchangeable phase (21%) was \nalso observed in the Luiz Rau stream, in accordance \nto studies by Irabien and Velasco (1999), Hang et al. \n(2009), and Liu et al. (2009). The increase of Cu in \nthe oxidizable stage is related to sulfur increasing (see \nTable III) in the lower of the Sinos River, indicating this \nmetal appearance as sulfides. According to Pedrozo \n(2003), the copper bioavailability decreases with the \ncomplexities and absorption of this element to the \norganic matter/sulfur and to Fe/Mn oxyhydroxides.\n\nZn concentrations (Table IV) ranged from 112 \nto 316 mg/kg, with an increase in the lower part \nof the Sinos River basin, in particular at the sites \nof the Luiz Rau stream, SI 019, and SI 008. That \ncorresponds to the low course of the river where the \nsediments are deposited due to low water energy. \nAccording to Horowitz (1991) and Miller (1997), \nenvironments characterized by calm waters and thin \nparticles tend to show high metal concentration, if \ncompared to deposits associated to high energy \nregimes and thicker sediments. In this same part, \nthere is also an increase in the potential mobility of \nZn (Fig. 2), which increased from about 28% (SI \n\n\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2014) 86 (3)\n\n1051METAL CONTENT AND DISTRIBUTION IN SURFACE SEDIMENT\n\nFig. 2 - Geochemical distribution of Ni, Zn, Cu, Cr, Pb, Mn, Al and Fe in the Sinos River basin sediments (Step 1 = available fraction, \ni.e., exchangeable and bound to carbonates; Step 2 = reducible fraction; Step 3 = oxidizable fraction; Step 4 = residual fraction).\n\n\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2014) 86 (3)\n\n1052 ISMAEL L.

In Hang\u2019s \net al. study (2009), which evaluates the influence \nof electroplating industries, Zn was also extracted \npreferably in the exchangeable fraction. In the \nreducible step of the sequential extraction, Zn \nassociated with Fe and Mn oxides, hydroxides and \noxyhydroxides, capable of removing this metal \nfrom the aqueous phase (Boughriet et al. 2007), \nwas also extracted mainly in this step as indicated \n\nby studies of Irabien and Velasco (1999), Rodrigues \nand Formoso (2006), Boughriet et al. (2007), Li et \nal. (2009), Liu et al. (2009), Vymazal et al. (2010), \nand Dundar\u2019s et al. (2012).

The Pb \ngeochemical distribution was associated with the \nreducible (19-40%) and oxidizable (10-30%) steps, \n\n\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2014) 86 (3)\n\n1054 ISMAEL L. SCHNEIDER, ELBA C. TEIXEIRA, MARIA LUCIA K. RODRIGUES and SILVIA B.A. ROLIM\n\nindicating a potential average mobility of about \n50%. The Pb association to these phases has been \nreported by several authors e.g. Davidson et al. \n(1994, 2006), Kubov\u00e1 et al. (2008), Boughriet et \nal. (2007), Li et al. (2009), Vymazal et al. (2010), \nDavutluoglu et al. (2011), and Dundar et al. (2012). \nPb oxidizable fraction presence may be due to the \ncomplex-metal formation with humic substances \nand/or metal sulfides insoluble in the sediments \n(Davutluoglu et al. 2011). It has also been reported \nthat Pb can form stable complexes with Fe\u2013Mn oxides \n(Ramos et al. 1994, Liu et al. 2009). Anthropogenic \nPb contributions arise from solid waste material \ncontaining batteries, electronic devices with Pb/Sn \nsolder, and from effluents of chemical, metal plating \nand paint industries (Tokalioglu et al. 2003, Oliveira \net al. 2008, Dundar et al. 2012).\n\nTotal Mn concentrations (Table IV) varied a lot \nat the studied sites (397-1,901 mg/kg), especially \nat the Luiz Rau and the Port\u00e3o streams, which \nshowed the lowest concentrations. Mn showed a high \ndegree of geochemical mobility at all sites (see Fig. \n2), which is not necessarily due to anthropogenic \ncontributions, but may also be due to environmental \nand geochemical regional characteristics (Teixeira et \nal. 2003, Rodrigues and Formoso 2006). It happens \nbecause Mn tends to be present in thermodynami-\ncally less stable phases in sediments as the exchan-\ngeable ion Mn2+, as easily reducible Mn oxides and \nas Mn trapped in carbonate minerals (Davidson et \nal. 1994, Robaina et al. 2002, Sakan et al. 2009). \nMn was extracted mainly in the exchangeable (5-\n54%) and reducible (11-37%) fractions and showed \na behavior similar to that in other studies (Davidson \net al. 1994, Hang et al. 2009, Li et al. 2009, Liu \net al. 2009, Davutluoglu et al. 2011, Dundar et al. \n2012). Mn associated with the exchangeable fraction \nindicates that the metal is weakly adsorbed onto the \nsediment surface by relatively weak electrostatic \ninteractions and that it can be easily released by ion \nexchange processes and dissociation of Mn bound to \ncarbonates (Hang et al. 2009).\n\nTotal Ni concentrations (Table IV) showed no \nsignificant variations throughout the basin and \nvaried from 35 to 54 mg/kg. With regard to the Ni \ngeochemical distribution (see Fig. 2), there was \nan increase in the potentially mobile fractions of \nthis metal from site SI 066 onwards. Noteworthy \nare the high rates of mobility observed for the Luiz \nRau and the Port\u00e3o streams (about 70%), probably \nin response to the wastewater from tanneries and \nelectroplating industries. Ni was sequentially extrac-\nted in the three steps of the sequential extraction \nprocedure: exchangeable (2-24%), reducible (2-27%) \nand oxidizable (3-24%).\n\nFor Cr, there was also an increase in total \nconcentrations (Table IV) from the lower section \nof the Sinos River basin, varying between 112 \nand 1,286 mg/kg. The concentration observed in \nthe Port\u00e3o stream (1,286 mg/kg) was higher than \nthat of the other sites studied and well above the \nbackground level of the study area (80.3 mg/kg), set \nup by Robaina et al. (2002). As for the geochemical \ndistribution of Cr, we also observed an increase \nin the potentially mobile fractions (Fig. 2) from \npoint SI 066 on. Cr was associated mainly with the \noxidizable fraction, thus evidencing its preferential \nbinding to organic matter (Rodrigues and Formoso \n2006, Vymazal et al. 2010, Davutluoglu et al. 2011, \nDundar et al. 2012). According to the data, Cr and \nOM appearance at the same statistical analysis \nfactor (Table V) proves a Cr preferred association \nto organic fraction of the sequential extraction \nprocedure (step 3). The preferential association \nof Cr to the oxidizable phase indicated that most \nof that metal could be retained in the sediments in \nthe trivalent state, less toxic, and bound to organic \nmatter (Armienta et al. 1996, Wittbrodt and Palmer \n1996). From the Port\u00e3o stream, we extracted \n1,039 mg/kg in the oxidizable step, equivalent to \n81% of the total concentration of this metal. This \nhigh association of Cr to the oxidizable fraction is \nevidenced by the higher OM content in relation to \nother sites, see Table III. These high Cr levels are \n\n\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2014) 86 (3)\n\n1055METAL CONTENT AND DISTRIBUTION IN SURFACE SEDIMENT\n\nenvironmental markers of effluents from tanneries, \nas already reported by Rodrigues and Formoso \n(2006) and Oliveira et al. (2008), and they possibly \nreflect the influence of around 40 tanneries located \nin that region (FEPAM 2006).\n\nIn the present study, we found that the lower \nstretch of the Sinos River basin was the most \naffected area. Robaina et al. (2002) have already \nindicated that the sediments from the Luiz Rau \nstream were strongly affected by Cr (up to 1,050 \nmg/kg), Cu (up to 900 mg/kg), Zn (up to 3,000 mg/\nkg), Pb (200 mg/kg), and Ni (200 mg/kg), meaning \nhighest pollution level according to the index \nadopted in that study. They also found metal levels \nin sediments of the main course of the Sinos River \nsimilar to those reported in this study. Oliveira et \nal. (2008) analyzed soil at two landfills near the \nSinos River and found contamination from waste \nof leather industries and electroplating industries. \nThey found concentrations of up to 1,744 mg/kg \nof Cr, 355 mg/kg of Zn, 94 mg/kg of Cu, and 44 \nmg/kg of Ni. They also pointed out the high levels \nof Pb (up to 70 mg/kg), reported in the study as \noriginating from the disposal of urban solid waste \nthat may contain batteries, electronic devices with \nPb/Sn solder, material colored with lead paint, and \npackaging labels.\n\nEXTRACTION WITH 0.5 MOL/L HCl\n\nIn this study, we evaluated Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr, and \nPb potential mobile concentrations (Table IV) \nextracted by 0.5 mol/L HCl solution. As indicated \nby Sutherland and Tack (2008), it is possible \nto establish a linear regression between the \nconcentrations extracted by 0.5 mol/L HCl and \nthe sum of the first three steps of the sequential \nextraction procedure. The best linear regression \nwas observed for Zn and is shown in Figure 3. \nLinear regressions found for the studied metals are \nshown in Table VI. All of them showed satisfactory \nr2 values: Cu (r2=0.9587), Zn (r2=0.9961), Ni \n(r2=0.9762), Cr (r2=0.9877) and Pb (r2=0.9049). \n\nThese regression relationships are encouraging \nas the HCl leach seems to be extracting the same \nsuite of phases in the sediments as the BCR labile \napproach, but not to the same extent.\n\nFig. 3. Correlation between the Zn concentration extracted \nfrom sediment samples with 0.5 mol/L HCl, and the sum \nof three labile phases extracted by sequential extraction \nprocedure BCR (n = 10).\n\nThus, through this simple, fast (1 h) and low-cost \nextraction procedure, it is possible to identify the \nsamples that show higher levels of potential mobile \nmetals in sediments, derived from anthropogenic \ncontributions. This screening of samples allows for a \nmore careful evaluation of only the anthropogenically \nimpacted samples, saving time, costs, and chemical \nreagents. However, before adopting the dilute \nHCl approach for all sediments, it is imperative to \nconduct a preliminary investigation to establish the \ndegree of association between anthropogenic metals \nleached by dilute HCl and the potential mobile \nfractions liberated by the BCR approach. As an \nexample, recent data from Cook and Parker (2006) \nindicates that this relationship may not hold for all \nenvironments. These authors found that the 0.5 M \nHCl leach removed 35 times less Pb than the sum of \nthe first three steps of the optimized BCR procedure \nfor canal sediment contaminated by waste from a \nmetal processing plant in France.\n\nSEDIMENT QUALITY ASSESSMENT\n\nTable VII shows the interval and average of the \nmetal total concentrations for the Sinos River basin \n\n\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2014) 86 (3)\n\n1056 ISMAEL L.

Another \nimportant point to be taken into consideration is the \nnumber of people living in the area, and their liquid \nwaste. This may also be affecting the increase of \nmetal concentrations in the lower Sinos River.\n\n\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2014) 86 (3)\n\n1057METAL CONTENT AND DISTRIBUTION IN SURFACE SEDIMENT\n\nTABLE VII\nMetals concentration (mg/kg) in the study area (minimum-\n\nmaximum) (average) compared with values from the literature.\n\nLocation Cr Cu Ni Zn Pb Mn Reference\n\nSinos River\n112 \u2013 1,286 69.2 \u2013 121 34.9 \u2013 54.1 112 \u2013 316 25.4 \u2013 59.5 397 \u2013 1,901\n\nThis study\n254 87.5 44.0 206 37.0 1,081\n\nLower part of the \nSinos basin 20.0 \u2013 1,200 20.0 \u2013 1,175 20.0 \u2013 325 50.0 \u2013 5,300 20.0 \u2013 200 *\n\nRobaina et al. \n2002\n\nSoil at two landfills \nnear the Sinos river 205 \u2013 1,744 35.0 \u2013 94.0 13.0 \u2013 44.0 57.0 \u2013 355 23.0 \u2013 70.0 200 \u2013 900\n\nOliveira et al. \n2008\n\nCadeia River - Brazil 34.7 \u2013 423 57.8 \u2013 102 27.0 \u2013 74.9 122 \u2013 147 * 1,090 \u2013 2,210 Rodrigues and Formoso 2006\n\nFeitoria River - Brazil 169 \u2013 1,031 93.8 \u2013 106 71.2 \u2013 91.1 136 \u2013 145 * 1,080 \u2013 2,230 Rodrigues and Formoso 2006\n\nEstrela River - Brazil 8.44 \u2013 100 10.0 \u2013 74.5 26.0 \u2013 95.9 42.5 \u2013 351 45.8 \u2013 121.4 164 \u2013 811 Rangel et al. 2011\n\nSakarya river - Turkey 37.0 37.5 83.0 76.7 41.3 772 Dundar et al. 2012\n\nSeyhan River - Turkey 46.3 \u2013 122 3.68 \u2013 57.2 82.2 \u2013 215 34.2 \u2013 146 11.3 \u2013 74.7 144 \u2013 638 Davutluoglu et al. 2011\nRivers in the Jiangsu \nProvince - Eastern \n\nChina\n345 \u2013 9,671 440 \u2013 9,797 251 \u2013 2,846 391 \u2013 1,483 17.2 \u2013 106 338 \u2013 782 Hang et al. 2009\n\nBrunette River - \nCanada * 12.0 \u2013 225 * 56.0 \u2013 335 63.0 \u2013 722 217 \u2013 1,452 Li et al. 2009\n\nDe\u00fble-canal - \nNorthern France * * * 149 \u2013 12,895 26.8 \u2013 10,079 *\n\nBoughriet et al. \n2007\n\nOka River - Spain 20.0 \u2013 180 30.0 \u2013 150 30.0 \u2013 130 100 \u2013 360 30 \u2013 110 370 \u2013 1,600 Irabien and Velasco 1999\n\nBackground 80.3 39.4 50.5 82.4 42.0 * Robaina et al. 2002\n\nAverage shale 90.0 45.0 68.0 95.0 20.0 850 Turekian and Wedepohl 1961\n\n* Not available.\n\nMoreover, in order to evaluate sediment quality, \nTable VIII compares the average total metal con-\ncentration with sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) \nfrom Canada (CCME 1999) and with the study of \nLong et al.

With regard to the Canadian study, \nit can be seen that Cu and Cr in the three stretches of \nthe river basin, Zn in the upper and lower stretches, \nand Pb in the lower stretch, showed higher average \nconcentrations than the interim freshwater sediment \nquality (ISQG) value. As for the probable effects \nlevel (PEL) criterion, only Cr, in the lower stretch \nof the basin, showed higher average concentration. \nConsidering the criteria of the study by Long et al. \n(1995), we see that the average concentrations of \nCu, Ni and Cr in the three stretches, and Zn and Pb \n\nin the lower stretch, were higher than the Effect \nRange Low (ERL) and Threshold Effects Level \n(TEL) concentrations. As for PEL, only the average \nlevels of Ni and Cr in the lower basin were higher. \nThere were no average concentrations higher than \nthe effect range median (ERM) criterion. Therefore, \nbased on the SQGs approach, the Sinos River basin \nwould be classified as an area with free to moderate \ntoxicological risk, when considering only the total \nconcentration of metals, except the Port\u00e3o stream, \nthat showed moderate to high pollution.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe higher concentrations of Cr, Cu, Zn and \nPb were observed in the lower stretch of the \n\n\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2014) 86 (3)\n\n1058 ISMAEL L.

This region, that has \nhigher population density and industrial plants \n(mainly metal works, electroplating industries, \nand tanneries), showed an increase in both the \ntotal concentrations (Cu, Cr, Zn and Pb) and in \nthe sequentially extracted mobile fractions (Cu, \nCr, Ni and Zn). Cr pointed out, particularly in the \nPort\u00e3o stream, showed 1,286 mg/kg as the total \nconcentration and 88% in the potentially mobile \nfractions, due to the influence of the local tannery. \nThese pollutants are available in the aquatic \nenvironment due to their association with different \nsediment phases.\n\nThe sequential extraction indicated that the \nmetals were associated with the exchangeable (Ni, \nZn, Cu), reducible (Ni, Zn, Cu, Pb) and oxidizable \nphases (Ni, Cu, Cr, Pb). These results showed \nsimilar distribution with studies that evaluated \nsites impacted by the same anthropogenic sources. \nRegarding the sediment quality assessment, these \nregions can be classified as an area with free to \nmoderate toxicological risk, except Port\u00e3o stream, \nthat showed moderate to high pollution.\n\nPartial extractions are valuable tools for a \npreliminary survey, where critical contaminants \nand priority areas have to be identified. In our \nstudy, the potentially mobile metals extracted with \na 0.5 mol/L HCl solution presented satisfactory \n\ncorrelation with the concentrations extracted by \nthe sequential extraction scheme. Although some \nproblems in the sequential extractions have not \nbeen fully resolved yet, the use of these procedures \ngenerate more complete information, enabling \na more detailed characterization of the origin, \nchemical form, distribution, and metals potential \navailability. In this study the sequential extraction \nprocedure demonstrated good reproducibility for \nthe certified reference material (BCR 701) used.\n\nConsidering the factor analysis, it is possible \nto identify the main anthropogenic contributions \nin the Sinos River basin sediments. Further studies \nwith geochemical focus are needed in order to \nhave a better assessment of the potential retention \nand release of metals sediments, as well as to \nmineralogically feature the sediments in this area. \nBased on these studies, it will be possible to do an \naccurate assessment of the potential risk of metals \ncontamination through their remobilization and the \ncurrent condition of this study area with regards to \nthese pollutants.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe are grateful to Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento \nde Pessoal de N\u00edvel Superior (CAPES) for granting \nthe master's scholarship and to the Laboratory of \nChemistry and Sampling Service of Funda\u00e7\u00e3o \n\n\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2014) 86 (3)\n\n1059METAL CONTENT AND DISTRIBUTION IN SURFACE SEDIMENT\n\nEstadual de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o Ambiental Henrique Luiz \nRoessler (FEPAM).\n\nRESUMO\n\nO presente estudo teve como objetivo avaliar o teor de \nCu, Cr, Ni, Zn, Pb, Mn, Al e Fe e sua parti\u00e7\u00e3o geoqu\u00edmica \nem sedimentos da bacia hidrogr\u00e1fica do rio dos Sinos, Sul do \nBrasil.
