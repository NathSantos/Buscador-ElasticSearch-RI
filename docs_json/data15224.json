Sex reassignment surgery (SRS) and hormone therapy \nprovide a means of allowing transsexual individuals to feel more \ncongruent with their gender and have played a major role in \ntreatment over the past 70 years. Brain-derived neurotrophic \nfactor (BDNF) appears to play a key role in recovery from acute \nsurgical trauma and environmentally mediated vulnerability to \npsychopathology. We hypothesize that BDNF may be a biomarker \nof alleviation of gender incongruence suffering.\nObjectives: To measure preoperative and postoperative serum \nBDNF levels in transsexual individuals as a biomarker of allevia-\ntion of stress related to gender incongruence after SRS.\nMethods: Thirty-two male-to-female transsexual people who \nunderwent both surgery and hormonal treatment were selected \nfrom our initial sample. BDNF serum levels were assessed befo-\nre and after SRS with sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent \nassay (ELISA). The time elapsed between the pre-SRS and post-\n-SRS blood collections was also measured.\nResults: No significant difference was found in pre-SRS or post-\n-SRS BDNF levels or with relation to the time elapsed after SRS \nwhen BDNF levels were measured.\nConclusion: Alleviation of the suffering related to gender in-\ncongruence after SRS cannot be assessed by BDNF alone. Sur-\ngical solutions may not provide a quick fix for psychological dis-\ntress associated with transsexualism and SRS may serve as one \nstep toward, rather than as the conclusion of, construction of a \nperson\u2019s gender identity.\nKeywords: Transsexualism, sex reassignment surgery, BDNF.\n\nResumo\n\nIntrodu\u00e7\u00e3o: O transexualismo (CID-10) \u00e9 uma condi\u00e7\u00e3o caracte-\nrizada por forte e persistente dissocia\u00e7\u00e3o com o g\u00eanero atribu\u00eddo. \nA cirurgia de redesigna\u00e7\u00e3o sexual (CRS) e a terapia hormonal (TH) \npermitem que indiv\u00edduos transexuais se sintam mais congruentes \ncom seu g\u00eanero e, por isso, t\u00eam desempenhado papel importan-\nte nos \u00faltimos 70 anos.

Although several studies \nhave evaluated psychological recovery using subjective \ntools, no studies have evaluated the potential of a \nbiological marker as an objective tool for assessing post-\nSRS  alleviation of transsexual suffering.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nParticipants and procedures\n\nIn this prospective cohort study, male-to-female \ntranssexual people were recruited between February \n2009 and December 2015 and monitored after SRS. All \npatients underwent classic penile inversion vaginoplasty, \nthe surgical gold standard for male-to-female \nreassignment. All operations were performed by a single \nsurgeon with many years of experience in this technique.\n\nThe inclusion criteria were as follows: diagnosis of \ntranssexualism (ICD-10) established by a psychiatrist, \nage greater than 18 years, and a post-SRS period of \nat least 6 months. We have chosen to use the term \ntranssexualism based on ICD-10 criteria; however, we \nare aware of current nomenclature changes. Patients \nsuffering from axis I psychotic disorders, mental \nretardation, or substance addiction were excluded from \nthe study. Although the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual \nof Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) diagnostic \ncriteria are now no longer used, data collection was \ncarried out between 2008 and 2015, when these \ncriteria were still current, and the Mini International \nNeuropsychiatric Interview (MINI 6.0) is in accordance \nwith the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \nDisorders, 4th edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR). All \npatients signed an informed consent form for the study, \nwhich was approved by the Research Ethics Committee \n(CEP HCPA N\u00ba 08-167).\n\nDuring this period, we evaluated 84 new patients \nin the clinic. Of these patients, 65 fully fit the surgical \ncriteria and underwent SRS; 33 of these 65 patients \nwere excluded from the analysis due to a lack of data \nor because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. The \nfinal sample contained 32 individuals. All male-to-female \ntranssexuals who underwent both surgery and hormone \ntreatment during this period were selected for the study. \nFigure 1 illustrates the process of exclusion or inclusion \nof participants who attended the initial evaluation.\n\nIntroduction\n\nTranssexualism (International Classification of \nDiseases, version 10 [ICD-10]) is a condition characterized \nby a strong and persistent dissociation with one\u2019s assigned \ngender.1 This experience is psychologically taxing and is \ncompounded by distress caused by social stigmatization.2 \n\nFurthermore, transsexual individuals report a high \nprevalence of childhood trauma, with particularly high rates \nof emotional abuse and negligence. Sex reassignment \nsurgery (SRS) and hormone therapy provide a means of \nallowing transsexual individuals to feel more congruent with \ntheir gender, and have played a major role in treatment \nover the past 70 years.1-6\n\nBrain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a \nmember of the growth factor family that is involved in \npromoting synaptic plasticity, including neurogenesis, \nneuronal survival, and the normal maturation of neuronal \ndevelopmental pathways.7-9 Low BDNF levels are a \nbiomarker for a range of neuropsychiatric disorders, such \nas advanced bipolar disease,10 major depressive episodes11 \n\nand schizophrenia.12 BDNF levels increase in response to \nantidepressant, lithium, and valproate treatments.8\n\nBDNF has also been linked to several recovery \nsituations. While low BDNF levels have been associated with \nsubstance abuse disorder, increased levels of brain-derived \nneurotrophin were found during abstinence in substance \nabuse disorders, e.g., alcohol withdrawal,13 likely signaling \nneuronal recovery. Additionally, high levels of BDNF have \nbeen associated with craving in opiate-dependent patients, \nsignaling a possible maladaptive plasticity associated \nwith drug-seeking behavior during abstinence,14 and a \nsimilar pattern has been observed in patients with cocaine \ndependence, possibly predicting cocaine abuse relapse.15\n\nExtensive research has been conducted over the \npast two decades focusing on the means by which BDNF \nmodulates neuroplasticity. For example, in 1995 Korte \net al.16 showed that BDNF is predominantly synthesized \nby neurons and Bergami et al.,17 showed that astrocytes \nplay the role of storing and secreting BDNF. Moreover, glia \nhave been found to utilize BDNF in neuroinflammatory and \nneuroprogressive processes,18 such as neuronal lesions19 \n\nand inflammatory conditions.20\n\nThe way in which hormone therapy in transsexuals may \nalter BDNF levels has proven a controversial subject. Fuss \net al.21 conducted a study comparing transsexual females \nwith controls and found no differences in BDNF levels \nafter estrogen therapy, Fontanari et al.,22 supposed that \nthe low BDNF levels they found in transsexual individuals \ncould be related to emotional trauma in childhood, while \nKauer et al.,23 found that low BDNF levels \u2013 as detected, \nfor example, in bipolar individuals \u2013 were associated with \ntraumatic life events.\n\n\n\nBDNF serum concentrations in transsexuals - Schneider MA et al.\n\nTrends Psychiatry Psychother. 2017;39(1) \u2013 45 \n\nMain outcome measures\n\nFive mL of peripheral blood were taken from each \nsubject by venipuncture into an anti-coagulant-free \nvacuum tube. The blood was centrifuged at 4000 x \ng for 10 min, and the serum was frozen at -80 \u00baC until \nassayed. Tests were conducted with sandwich enzyme \nlinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), according to the \nmanufacturer\u2019s specifications (Chemicon, USA). In short, \n96-well flat-bottom microtiter plates were filled with the \nsamples (diluted 1:2 in sample diluents) and left for a \n24-hour period. The standard curve ranged from 7.8 to \n500 pg of BDNF. Plates were then washed four times with \nwash buffer, monoclonal anti-BDNF rabbit antibody (diluted \n1:1000 with sample diluents) was added, and then plates \nwere incubated for three hours at room temperature. After \nwashing, a second incubation with anti-rabbit antibody \nperoxidase conjugate (diluted 1:1000) was carried out for \none hour at room temperature. Next, streptavidin-enzyme, \nsubstrate, and stop solution were added, and the amount \nof BDNF was measured (absorbance set at 450 nm). The \nstandard curve demonstrated a direct relationship between \noptical density and BDNF concentration. Total protein was \nmeasured using Lowry\u2019s method, using bovine serum \nalbumin as a standard.\n\nAnalysis was performed using the Statistical Package for \nthe Social Sciences (SPSS) version 18.0. Most BDNF value \nfits were normally distributed and were therefore subjected \n\nFigure 1 - Diagram of loss and/or exclusion of patients.\n\nto parametric analyses. Two-sided paired t test analyses \nwere conducted to compare BDNF measures, significant at \np &lt;0.05. Data were presented as the mean \u00b1 standard \ndeviation. Pearson correlations were used to analyze the \nrelationship between  the time of blood collection, in days \nafter SRS, and BDNF levels.\n\nResults\n\nThe mean age of transsexual patients was 28.75\u00b16.53. \nBDNF serum levels were measured 279.28\u00b1190.34 days \nafter male-to-female SRS. The interval between the first \nand the second blood sample collections was 847\u00b1797.09 \ndays. Mean serum BDNF levels were 18.55\u00b15.99 and \n17.83\u00b16.47, pre-SRS and post-SRS respectively. There was \nno difference between pre-SRS and post-SRS BDNF levels: \n? = -0.73, median difference = -1.36 t32 = 0.67, p = 0.50, \n95% confidence interval = -1.46 to 2.92 (Figure 2). There \nwas no significant correlation between the time of blood \ncollection after SRS and post-SRS BDNF levels (r = -0.11, \np = 0.54) or between the time between the pre-SRS and \npost-SRS blood collections and post-SRS BDNF levels (r = \n-0.05, p = 77).\n\nFifteen HIV+ subjects were included in the sample. \nThese patients were included in the final analysis because \nwe were comparing the same cases before and after \nSRS and so this confounding factor affected the two data \ncollection times equally.\n\nFigure 2 - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels \nbefore and after sex reassignment surgery (SRS) and \n\ndifferences between them.\n\nDiscussion\n\nBDNF has been identified as a possible predictor of \ntreatment response in some types of psychiatric distress.24 \nThere is also evidence to suggest that patients remain \n\n\n\nBDNF serum concentrations in transsexuals - Schneider MA et al.\n\n46 \u2013 Trends Psychiatry Psychother. 2017;39(1) \n\nsatisfied after SRS and that it alleviates the suffering \ncaused by living in non-conformity with their gender \nidentity.25-27 In alignment with this extant research, this \nstudy posited that alleviation of this suffering after SRS \nwould be traceable through BDNF serum levels.\n\nHowever, contrary to this hypothesis, the difference \nbetween preoperative and postoperative BDNF levels \nwas not significant. One way to interpret these findings \nis to consider that SRS could serve as one step toward, \nrather than the conclusion of, a person\u2019s gender identity \nconstruction and so the molecular response may require \nextensive recuperation, not occurring immediately after \nSRS. This interpretation can be sustained considering \nthat SRS cannot reverse the effects of the chronic \npsychological trauma associated with transsexuals\u2019 life \nexperiences, at least not in the short term or as an \nisolated intervention.\n\n Another important point to consider is the \neffect on BDNF levels of the neuroactive steroids used by \npatients. All of our participants were undergoing hormonal \nsex reassignment therapy. A myriad of in vitro studies \nhave evaluated the type of neuronal effects exerted \nby the steroids we currently use in the reassignment \nprocess. Estradiol and progesterone have been shown to \ndirectly and indirectly increase neuroplasticity, via BDNF \naugmentation and glutamate respectively.28 These in \nvitro models have demonstrated that steroidal hormones \naugment release of BDNF from neurons or astrocytes.29\n\nNotably, Fuss et al.,21 found a negative correlation \nbetween estradiol treatment during the reassignment \nprocess and BDNF levels in their group of transsexual \nwomen. Their finding was somewhat surprising, because \nearlier studies had found the opposite. There is a correlation \nbetween the menses cycle and brain neurotrophin \nsecretion, for example, with positive BDNF fluctuation in \nresponse to estradiol30 at the end of the follicular phase. \nOn one hand, we expect elevation of BDNF levels after SRS \n\u2013 consistent with other psychiatric models of suffering \nalleviation (anxiety, major depression, bipolar disease, \nschizophrenia, and PTSD) \u2013 but on the other hand, we \nhave information that BDNF levels diminish with estradiol \ntreatment. We can therefore hypothesize that the effects \nof these interventions are opposite and neutralizing when \nconjugated. Any augmentation of BDNF due to alleviation \nof distress would be neutralized by the negative effects of \nestradiol on BDNF in transsexuals.\n\nNevertheless, studying transsexuals may be subject \nto certain peculiarities compared with studying non-\ntranssexual individuals. The majority of neurobiological \nmodels of neuroactive steroids are tested in non-\ntranssexual individuals or in animals. The significance \nof this must be considered. There are indications that \ntranssexual individuals respond differently to steroids \n\nthan cissexuals do. For a long period of time, it was \nbelieved that the brain would be dimorphic in some \naspects for men and women, with a type of intermediate \nvariation of some structures for transsexuals,31 and \nestrogen exerts an effect on neuronal development.32 \nAlthough new evidence of brain morphology and \nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging contest the idea \nof macroscopic dimorphisms across gender,33 we do not \nknow exactly what happens microscopically in treatment \nwith estradiol, an XY chromosome: Molecular responses \nmight be \u201cdimorphic.\u201d There may be microscopic \u2013 beyond \nmolecular \u2013 properties intrinsic to the sexual chromatin \nthat dictate different responses between transsexual and \nnon-transsexual individuals, e.g., the second messenger \nmachinery and the neurokinin system.\n\n Increasing sample sizes to ensure that there \nBDNF serum levels are truly non-significant biologically, \nand not a result of our meager participant pool, would be \nadvisable for forthcoming research.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough this particular study has proven non-\nsignificant, it has provided a critical inference: surgical \nsolutions may not provide a quick fix for psychological \ndistress associated with transsexualism. Although \nBDNF levels may be able to recover rapidly from acute \ntrauma, it appears that transsexualism may require \nmore extensive rehabilitation, in accordance with the \nhypothesis that the early and continual neurological \neffects of prejudice that transsexual patients suffer \nthroughout their lives could be observed as continuous \ntrauma that influences neuroplasticity, resulting from \nsocial vulnerability.34,35 These results have opened up \navenues for more comprehensive research opportunities \nthat could evaluate the association of BDNF levels in \ntranssexualism. While ensuing studies will need to \nreaddress confounding factors in this methodology, these \nresults should allow for a more extensive and informed \nsupport system for medical interventions in transsexual \nindividuals.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis study was supported by Conselho Nacional de \nDesenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico (CNPq).\n\nReferences\n1.
