Assim, a por\u00e7\u00e3o inferior da Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Inpixuna caracteriza-se por \n\numa unidade de caulim do tipo soft, o qual por apresentar-se com preserva\u00e7\u00e3o das estruturas \n\nprim\u00e1rias, possibilitou melhor entendimento dos processos de sedimenta\u00e7\u00e3o.

Durante este processo, tr\u00eas tipos principais de caulinita foram \n\ngeradas, definidas com base no tamanho e textura como Ka, Kb e Kc. A caulinita Ka ocorre \n\ndominantemente associada aos arenitos caulinizados, sendo caracterizada por cristais \n\npseudohexagonais a hexagonais, com di\u00e2metros de 10-30 \u00b5m, podendo ocorrer na forma de \n\naglomerados formando \u201clivretos\u201d (booklets) ou sob forma vermicular contendo at\u00e9 400 \u00b5m de \n\ncomprimento.

This unit distinguishs for presenting one of the largest \n\nworldwide kaolin concentrations of excellent quality to the cellulose industry. Beyond the \n\neconomic character, a great volume of academic works focusing these kaolin deposits had led to \n\npedological and geochemical approaches, but without taking into account their sedimentologic \n\naspects, which are important to understand their genesis. Detailed sedimentologic and \n\nstratigraphic studies of the Rio Capim kaolin have been increasingly carried out in the last years, \n\nwhich led to the paleoenvironmental interpretations for the Ipixuna Formation, as well as to \n\ndiscuss better the mode of formation of the soft and semi-flint kaolin units that are typical of this \n\nunit. These works served to motivate the integration of sedimentologic and stratigraphic data with \n\noptical studies combined with hydrogen and oxygen isotope geochemistry in order to discuss the \n\ngeologic processes involved in the origin and evolution of the soft and semi-flint kaolin units. \n\nThe sedimentological analysis consisted in a more detailed facies description and stratigraphic \n\nanalysis of newly open quarries that were not available during previous investigations. The \n\nadditional exposures led to a better characterization of the lower kaolin unit, known as the \u201csoft \n\nkaolin\u201d, which is well stratified, favoring facies analysis. Hence, the soft kaolin unit consists of \n\nkaolinitized sandstones and kaolinitized pelites that were formed in tidally influenced fluvial \n\nchannels (Facies Association A), tidal channel (Facies Association B), tidal flat/mangrove (Facies \n\nAssociation C), and tidal sand bar/tidal sandy flat (Facies Association D). These depositional \n\nenvironments are attributed to a tide-dominated estuarine system. \n\nPetrographic studies and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) of the kaolin deposits in \n\nthe study area had their composition was strongly modified after sedimentation. The soft kaolin \n\nconsists of kaolinitized quartz sandstone and either laminated or massive pelites, which are \n\ncomposed by fragments of meta-volcanic lithic and volcanic felsic rocks, as well as metamorphic \n\nand granitics rocks. These lithologies were strongly modified during kaolinitization, as revealed \n\nby the intense replacement of the framework grains by kaolinite of three types, named herein as \n\nKa, Kb and Kc kaolinites. Ka kaolinite occurs dominantly associated with kaolinitized \n\nsandstones, being characterized by pseudohexagonal crystals 10-30 \u00b5m in diameter, which are \n\norganized as booklets or vermicular forms that reach up to 400 \u00b5m in length.  Kb kaolinite \n\n 4\n\n\n\n 5\n\ndominantes in the pelites, and consists of pseudohexagonal crystals 1-3 \u00b5m in diameter, \n\noccurring as isolated, face-to-face and parallel to pseudo-parallel crystals. Kc kaolinite forms \n\npseudohexagonal to hexagonal crystals of 200 nm in diameter. It occurs dispersed through the \n\nsoft unit, increasing significantly in abundance in association with paleosols at the top of the unit. \n\nThe semi-flint kaolin deposits are constituted mainly of reworked grains derived from the \n\nunderlying soft kaolin unit that are mixed with grains derived from metamorphic and granitic \n\nsources. These deposits are dominantly composed of Kc kaolinite that was formed during \n\nweathering.   \n\nThe deuterium (?D) and oxygen (?O) isotope analysis of the kaolin deposits from the \n\nstudy area helped to discuss better the evolution of the different types of kaolinites described \n\nabove. Hence, the soft kaolin deposits display ?O values varying between 6.04 \u2030 and 19.18 \u2030 \n\nin the Ka+Kb kaolinites, and between 15.38 \u2030 and 24.86 \u2030 in the Kc kaolinite. The ?D values \n\nfrom this unit vary from \u2013 63.06 \u2030 to 79.46 \u2030, and from \u201368.85\u2030 to -244.35\u2030 in the Ka+Kb \n\nand Kc kaolinites, respectively. The semi-flint kaolin deposits are characterized by ?O and ?D \n\nvalues ranging from 15.08\u2030 to 21.77\u2030, and from -71.31\u2030 to -87.37\u2030, respectively. Based on \n\nthese data and on the isotopic composition of both meteoric and ground waters, it was possible to \n\nconclude that the kaolinites had not been formed in balance with modern weathering. These \n\nvalues represent the isotopic composition during the time of formation of the kaolinites, as well \n\nas mineralogical contamination of framework grains that are now replaced by kaolinites. \n\n  \n\n 5\n\n\n\n 6\n\nAPRESENTA\u00c7\u00c3O \n\n \n\nEsta tese de doutorado, intitulada \u201cAn\u00e1lise integrada dos dep\u00f3sitos de caulim da regi\u00e3o do \n\nRio Capim: f\u00e1cies, estratigrafia, petrografia e is\u00f3topos est\u00e1veis\u201d, est\u00e1 organizada em quatro \n\ncap\u00edtulos.

Esta \n\ninterpreta\u00e7\u00e3o baseia-se no posicionamento estratigr\u00e1fico acima de dep\u00f3sitos albo-cenomanianos \n\ncorrelacion\u00e1veis \u00e0 Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Alc\u00e2ntara da Bacia de S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds-Graja\u00fa, o que leva a sugerir \n\nposs\u00edvel idade cret\u00e1cea superior. Isto \u00e9 ainda sugerido pela ocorr\u00eancia de dep\u00f3sitos terci\u00e1rios de \n\nidade prov\u00e1vel mioc\u00eanica m\u00e9dio/superior sobrepostos \u00e0 Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Ipixuna. \n\nA Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Ipixuna na regi\u00e3o do Rio Capim, leste da Sub-Bacia de Camet\u00e1, destaca-se \n\npor apresentar uma das maiores concentra\u00e7\u00f5es mundiais de dep\u00f3sitos de caulim de excelente \n\nqualidade \u00e0 industria de celulose (Krebs &amp; Arantes, 1973; Murray &amp; Keller, 1993). Estes \n\ndep\u00f3sitos t\u00eam motivado diversos estudos de car\u00e1ter cient\u00edfico, principalmente geoqu\u00edmicos, \n\nenfocando os aspectos gen\u00e9ticos e evolutivos dos dep\u00f3sitos de caulim, por\u00e9m sem \u00eanfase na \n\ncaracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o de seus aspectos sedimentol\u00f3gicos e estratigr\u00e1ficos. Somente recentemente foi \n\nfeito um esfor\u00e7o no sentido de caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o faciol\u00f3gica da Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Ipixuna na Regi\u00e3o do Rio \n\nCapim (Santos Jr., 2002), o qual possibilitou o estabelecimento preliminar de um modelo \n\ndeposicional fl\u00favio-estuarino para esta unidade, embora a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o deste sistema atrav\u00e9s do \n\ntempo geol\u00f3gico ainda permaneceu por ser estabelecida. Os trabalhos geoqu\u00edmicos propuseram \n\norigem in situ para os dep\u00f3sistos de caulim relacionados inicialmente ao desenvolvimento de \n\nperfil baux\u00edtico e, posteriormente, ao intemperismo profundo ligado ao rebaixamento progressivo \n\ndo len\u00e7ol fre\u00e1tico (Truckenbrodt et al., 1991; Kotschoubey et al., 1996; 1999). Por\u00e9m, estudos \n\npreliminares nesta regi\u00e3o v\u00eam demonstrando haver uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o direta entre as diversas f\u00e1cies da \n\nForma\u00e7\u00e3o Ipixuna e os tipos de caulim. Al\u00e9m disto, o reconhecimento de superf\u00edcies de \n\ndescontinuidades internas a Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Ipixuna e coincidente com a delimita\u00e7\u00e3o dos dep\u00f3sitos de \n\ncaulim conhecidos como soft e o semi-flint levou a suspeitar da import\u00e2ncia do siginificado \n\nestratigr\u00e1fico no entendimento gen\u00e9tico e evolutivo dos tipos de dep\u00f3sitos de Caulim da regi\u00e3o \n\ndo Rio Capim (Santos Jr., 2002; Rossetti &amp; Santos Jr. 2003). Esta observa\u00e7\u00e3o levou a refor\u00e7ar a \n\nid\u00e9ia que a mudan\u00e7a no tipo de caulim possa estar vinculada a controle faciol\u00f3gico/estratigr\u00e1fico. \n\nEstudos relacionados \u00e0 caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o morfol\u00f3gica e estrutural dos diferentes tipos de caulinita de \n\nacordo com os aspectos sedimentol\u00f3gicos e estratigr\u00e1ficos da Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Ipixuna n\u00e3o tinham sido \n\n 9\n\n\n\n 10\n\nsistematicamente conduzidos at\u00e9 o momento. O conhecimento detalhado das varia\u00e7\u00f5es de f\u00e1cies \n\nsedimentares de acordo com a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o das esp\u00e9cies de caulinita representa uma abordagem \n\nin\u00e9dita sobre o desenvolvimento evolutivo das diferentes fases de caulinita da Forma\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nO emprego de is\u00f3topos est\u00e1veis de oxig\u00eanio e hidrog\u00eanio como ferramenta para o \n\nreconhecimento de minerais intemp\u00e9ricos formados em tempos e, portanto, condi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\npaleoambientais distintas podem revelar condi\u00e7\u00f5es de equil\u00edbrio isot\u00f3pico com seu ambiente \n\ngen\u00e9tico, j\u00e1 que uma vez formados, estes minerais ret\u00e9m sua assinatura isot\u00f3pica, refletindo as \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas do tempo de forma\u00e7\u00e3o (Savin &amp; Hsieh, 1997).  \n\n Por fim, os dep\u00f3sitos de caulim da \u00e1rea do Rio Capim s\u00e3o carentes de investiga\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ncient\u00edficas realizadas de forma integrada (p.e., faciologia, estratigrafia, petrografia e is\u00f3topos \n\nest\u00e1veis de O e H). Sendo assim, este trabalho se prop\u00f4s \u00e0 caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o dos estratos caul\u00ednicos \n\nna Regi\u00e3o do Rio Capim, procedendo-se a uma an\u00e1lise integrada de aspectos sedimentol\u00f3gicos, \n\nestratigr\u00e1ficos, \u00f3pticos (petrografia e microscopia eletr\u00f4nica), mineral\u00f3gicos e geoqu\u00edmicos, a fim \n\nde possibilitar uma discuss\u00e3o sobre os fatores que influenciaram sua origem e evolu\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nForma\u00e7\u00e3o Ipixuna. \n\n \n\n1.2 OBJETIVOS \n\n \n\nEsta tese teve como objetivo caracterizar os estratos caul\u00ednicos da Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Ipixuna na \n\nRegi\u00e3o do Rio Capim procedendo-se a uma an\u00e1lise integrada dos aspectos sedimentol\u00f3gicos, \n\nestratigr\u00e1ficos, mineral\u00f3gicos e de is\u00f3topos est\u00e1veis. Al\u00e9m disto, consistiu tamb\u00e9m no \n\nprosseguimento aos estudos faciol\u00f3gicos e estratigr\u00e1ficos da Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Ipixuna, afim de melhor \n\ncaracterizar o sistema estuarino proposto, bem como entender sua din\u00e2mica evolutiva dentro do \n\ncontexto de varia\u00e7\u00f5es do n\u00edvel do mar relativo. Os estudos \u00f3pticos foram conduzidos na \n\nfinalidade de entender a g\u00eanese e evolu\u00e7\u00e3o das diferentes fases de forma\u00e7\u00e3o de caulinita, bem \n\ncomo caracterizar petrograficamente os dep\u00f3sitos de caulim de acordo com as caracter\u00edsticas \n\nfaciol\u00f3gicas/estratigr\u00e1ficas. A determina\u00e7\u00e3o da composi\u00e7\u00e3o isot\u00f3pica de oxig\u00eanio e hidrog\u00eanio \n\ndos dep\u00f3sitos de caulim da Regi\u00e3o do Rio Capim foi empregada de acordo com as caracter\u00edsticas \n\nfaciol\u00f3gicas e estratigr\u00e1ficas, e petrogr\u00e1ficas, a fim de gerar considera\u00e7\u00f5es paleoambientais de \n\norigem e evolu\u00e7\u00e3o da Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Ipixuna, bem como discutir a aplicabilidade do m\u00e9todo. \n\n \n\n 10\n\n\n\n 11\n\n1.3 M\u00c9TODOS  \n\n \n\nNeste trabalho foram adotadas a seguinte metodologia: an\u00e1lise faciol\u00f3gica/estratigr\u00e1fica, \n\nan\u00e1lise \u00f3ptica e geoqu\u00edmica de is\u00f3topos de O e H. O estudo faciol\u00f3gico/estratigr\u00e1fico de detalhe \n\nconsistiu no mapeamento complementar da arquitetura de f\u00e1cies deposicionais, e confec\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nperfis/se\u00e7\u00f5es verticais em novas frentes de lavra observando-se os par\u00e2metros sedimentol\u00f3gicos \n\n(p.e., estrutura, textura, mineralogia, padr\u00e3o de paleocorrentes, tra\u00e7os f\u00f3sseis e geometria dos \n\ncorpos sedimentares). Este m\u00e9todo foi conduzido nos dep\u00f3sitos cret\u00e1ceos da Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Ipixuna \n\nna por\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e9dia do Rio Capim, devido as novas frentes de lavra regurlamente espostas nas minas \n\nda IRCC e PPSA, o que representou a coleta de dados paleoambientais adicionais e contribuiu \n\npara o melhor entendimento da din\u00e2mica evolutiva deste sistema estuarino.  \n\nO estudo \u00f3ptico consistiu na an\u00e1lise de 60 se\u00e7\u00f5es delgadas sob microsc\u00f3pio petrogr\u00e1fico e \n\neletr\u00f4nico de varredura, a fim de melhor caracterizar os principais constituintes mineral\u00f3gicos e \n\nentender os processos sin- e p\u00f3s-deposicionais que controlaram a gera\u00e7\u00e3o dos diferentes tipos de \n\ncaulinita. As amostras de caulim foram amostradas seguindo r\u00edgido controle faciol\u00f3gico e \n\nestratigr\u00e1fico, de forma a registrar varia\u00e7\u00f5es litol\u00f3gicas e de processos sedimentares, bem como \n\nmelhor caracterizar o conte\u00fado mineral\u00f3gico e observar os padr\u00f5es morfol\u00f3gicos das caulinitas. \n\nAl\u00e9m disto, tomou-se cautela para se efetuar a coleta de amostras progressivamente abaixo e \n\nacima das superf\u00edcies de descontinuidade, de forma a possibilitar a an\u00e1lise de poss\u00edveis \n\ninflu\u00eancias de processos associados ao desenvolvimento das mesmas na forma\u00e7\u00e3o dos diferentes \n\ntipos de caulinita.  \n\nA an\u00e1lise isot\u00f3pica de hidrog\u00eanio e oxig\u00eanio consistiu na separa\u00e7\u00e3o granulom\u00e9trica pr\u00e9via \n\ndas fra\u00e7\u00f5es de caulinita Ka, Kb e Kc atrav\u00e9s de decanta\u00e7\u00e3o, as quais foram previamente \n\nestipuladas pela microscopia \u00f3ptica. As an\u00e1lises de is\u00f3topos est\u00e1veis foram realizadas seguindo \n\nmetodologia dos laborat\u00f3rios especializados da Universidade de Indiana (EUA). Os dados de \n\nis\u00f3topos est\u00e1veis de oxig\u00eanio e hidrog\u00eanio foram obtidos atrav\u00e9s da rea\u00e7\u00e3o de amostras de \n\ncaulinita com BrF5 e por aquecimento a v\u00e1cuo a 900\u00baC ou mais, ap\u00f3s o in\u00edcio do outgassing, \n\nrespectivamente. Adicionalmente foram feitas an\u00e1lises de is\u00f3topos da \u00e1gua mete\u00f3rica e de \n\nsubsurperf\u00edcie para efeitos de compara\u00e7\u00e3o com os dados isot\u00f3picos da caulinita. \n\n 11\n\n\n\n 12\n\nREFER\u00caNCIAS BIBLIOGR\u00c1FICAS \n\n \n\nANAISSE J\u00daNIOR, J. 1999.

DEPOSITIONAL MODEL OF THE IPIXUNA FORMATION (LATE \n\nCRETACEOUS-?EARLY TERTIARY), RIO CAPIM AREA, NORTHERN \n\nBRAZIL \n\n \n\n Ant\u00f4nio Em\u00eddio de Ara\u00fajo SANTOS Jr \n\n and Dilce de F\u00e1tima ROSSETTI \n\n \n2.1 ABSTRACT \n\n \n\nExposures along open quarries located in the eastern Camet\u00e1 Sub-Basin provide an \n\nopportunity to assess further discussion focusing on the depositional environments of the Upper \n\nCretaceous-?Lower Tertiary Ipixuna Formation. The lower part of this unit emphasized herein, \n\nknown as the \u201csoft kaolin\u201d, consists mostly of kaolinitized sandstones and mudstones that exhibit \n\nwell preserved sedimentary structures that are particularly favorable for facies analysis and \n\npaleoenvironmental reconstructions. The sandstones are chiefly cross-stratified, typically with \n\nlow angle, locally reverse oriented foresets with reactivation surfaces and/or mud drapes. These \n\ncharacteristics, together with a trace fossil assemblage consisting of Ophiomorpha, \n\nThalassinoids, Planolites, Teichichnus, Taenidium and Skolithos, conform to deposition in a \n\ncoastal setting influenced by tidal processes. Although a previous study has documented tidal \n\nprocesses during deposition of the soft kaolin (Santos Jr. and Rossetti, 2003), this paper shows \n\nthat the influence of tidal currents was much more important than initially proposed. Hence, the \n\nkaolinitized deposits are attributed to tidally influenced fluvial channel (Facies Association A), \n\ntidal channel (Facies Association B), tidal flat/mangrove (Facies Association C), and tidal sand \n\nbar/tidal sandy flat (Facies Association D), all together comprising a tide-dominated estuarine \n\nsystem. \n\n  \n\nKeywords: soft kaolin, Ipixuna Formation, Camet\u00e1 Sub-Basin, tide-dominated estuary, \n\nsedimentary facies, paleoenvironment. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n 15\n\n\n\n 16\n\n2.2 INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nSeveral mineralogical and geochemical studies (e.g., Truckenbrodt et al., 1991; \n\nKotschoubey et al., 1996, 1999; Souza, 2000) have been undertaken on the Ipixuna Formation \n\n(Upper Cretaceous-?Lower Tertiary), which is exposed in the eastern Camet\u00e1 Sub-Basin. These \n\nstudies have been motivated by the fact that this unit contains one of the largest kaolin reserves in \n\nthe world, the Rio Capim kaolin, which has received particular attention due to its high \n\nbrightness. Despite the economic interest, sedimentologic studies aiming paleoenvironmental \n\ninterpretations of the Rio Capim kaolin quarries are still inadequate to provide a detailed \n\nreconstruction of its mode of deposition.  \n\nTraditionally known as fluvial to lacustrine in origin (G\u00f3es, 1981), the Ipixuna Formation \n\nhas been more recently related to a coastal depositional system (Santos Jr. and Rossetti, 2003). \n\nSedimentary facies described in that study were attributed to tidal processes. Thereby, several \n\ntidally influenced depositional environments were recognized, which collectively led the authors \n\nto the interpretation of a wave-dominated estuary. This interpretation was based on the presence \n\nof tidal delta deposits along road cuts between the towns of Ipixuna and Paragominas, which \n\nwere considered correlative to the soft kaolin unit exposed in the kaolin quarries (Santos Jr. and \n\nRossetti, 2003).  However, stratigraphic studies have revealed that this unit is more complex than \n\ninitially thought, encompassing different stratigraphic units attributed to high-frequency \n\ndepositional sequences (Rossetti, 2004; Rossetti and Santos Jr., 2006). Taking this into account, \n\ncorrelation of the tidal delta deposits with the soft kaolin unit of the Ipixuna Formation in the Rio \n\nCapim area is problematic. The continuous kaolin exploitation has resulted in a series of fresh \n\nexposures that allow more detailed facies and stratigraphic analyses. As a result, other facies \n\nassemblages can be characterized, providing additional elements for a more refined \n\nreconstruction of the depositional model. \n\nThe goal of this paper is to provide a more complete description of the facies and facies \n\nassociations of the soft kaolin unit of the Ipixuna Formation. These are based on exposures \n\nrecently available in two quarries, the IRCC and the PPSA in the Rio Capim area (Fig. 1), in \n\norder to furnish a better interpretation of both the sedimentary processes and the depositional \n\nenvironments. Based on these data, it is possible now to assay a wave-dominated estuarine model \n\npreviously proposed for the soft kaolin.  \n\n 16\n\n\n\n 17\n\n3\u00b0\n\n2\u00b0\n\n1\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0\n\n1\u00b0N\n48\u00b049\u00b050\u00b051\u00b0\n\nMaraj\u00f3\nIsland\n\n47\u00b0 46\u00b0W\n\n100km\n\nAmazonas\nBasin\n\nS\u00e3o Lu\u00eds-Graja\u00fa\nBasin\n\nPar\u00e1 Platform\n\nBragantina \nPlatform\n\nIpixuna\nParagominas\n\nIRCC\n\nPPSA\n\nC\n\nL\n\nBRAZIL\nM\n\nHauterivian\n\nBarremian\n\nAptian\n\nAlbian\n\nMaastrichtian\n\nCampanian\n\nSantonian\nConiacian\n\nTuronian\nCenomanian\n\nAge Lithostratigraphy\nSubsurface\n\nQuaternary\n\nTertiary\n\nLo\nw\n\ner\n \n\nU\npp\n\ner\nC\n\nR\nE\n\nTA\nC\n\nE\nO\n\nU\nS\n\n   Breves\nFormation\n\n  Limoeiro\nFormation\n\n  Maraj\u00f3\nFormation\n\n Tucunar\u00e9/Pirarucu\n      Formation\n\n    Ipixuna\n Formation\n\n Pirabas/Barreiras \n      Formation\n\n P\u00f3s-Barreiras\n   Sediments\n\nSurface\n\nUnamed\n    Unit\n\n  \n  I\n\nta\npe\n\ncu\nru\n\n G\nro\n\nup\n\nCod\u00f3 Formation\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n4\u00b0\n\nCamet\u00e1 Sub-basin (C )\nLimoeiro (L) and Mexiana  (M) sub-basins \nTectonic lineament\n\nA)\n\nB)\n\nCapim River\n\nBel\u00e9m\n\n \nFigure 2.1: A) Location map of the study area in the Rio Capim area, Camet\u00e1 Sub-Basin, with the \nstudied kaolin quarries PPSA and RCC indicated.

The Cretaceous succession \n\nincludes the Breves Formation (Aptian-Cenomanian) and the Limoeiro Formation (Late \n\nCretaceous), considered to be fluvial and marine transitional in origin (Villegas, 1994). The \n\nTertiary and Quaternary deposits include the Maraj\u00f3 Formation (Paleocene-Eocene) and the \n\nTucunar\u00e9 Formation (Pleistocene), both formed within marine to transitional environments. \n\nExposures of Cretaceous rocks in the Camet\u00e1 Sub-Basin are only found in the eastern \n\nmargin of the basin, where Albian/Cenomanian deposits are cut by a kaolinitized Upper \n\nCretaceous unit referred to as the Ipixuna Formation. This unit is particularly well exposed in the \n\nRio Capim Kaolin area, where it approaches thicknesses of 40 m and consists of kaolinitized \n\nmudstones and sandstones. Previously regarded as a single stratigraphic unit, the Ipixuna \n\nFormation has been recently subdivided into two intervals, bounded by a discontinuity surface \n\nthat is marked by paleosol (Rossetti and Santos Jr., 2003; 2006; Rossetti, 2004). The lower part \n\nof the interval corresponds to the deposits referred to herein as the soft kaolin unit. The upper part \n\ncorresponds to a hard kaolin unit, known as the semi-flint, due to the composition of flint-like fire \n\nclay that consist of endured kaolinite showing no plasticity when ground up. An intermediate unit \n\ncharacterized by soft-sediment deformed deposits bounded also by discontinuity surfaces occurs \n\nbetween the soft kaolin and semi-flint at some localities (Rossetti and Santos Jr., 2003). The \n\nfacies analysis presented herein is focused solely in the soft kaolin unit, which bears the \n\ncommercially exploited kaolin.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 18\n\n\n\n 19\n\n \n\n0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200 225 300 325 350 m\nP1 P2 P3 P4 P6\n\n5m\n\n? ?\n? ? ?\n\nSemi-flint kaolin\nMuddy Unstructured\nTidal sand flat/tidal sandy bar and tidal flatmangrove   \n\nTidally-influenced fluvial channel/\n(1) Sandy and (2) Heterolithic tidal channel\nCoarse grained-sandstone (quartzose)\nLateritic paleosol\n\nTertiary deposits\n\nCovered\n\nArg. f m \nSand\n\ng\n\n1m\n\nArg. f m g\n\nQz\n\nQz1\nm\n\nArg. f m g\n\n1m\n\nArg. f m g\n\n1m\n\nArg. f m g\n\n1m\n\nSand SandSandSand\n\nP7\n\nTidal Channel/\n(1) Sandy and (2) Heterolithic tidal channel\n\nQz\n\nQz\n\nQz\n\nQz\n\nQz\n\nQzQzQzQzQz\n\nP7\n\nP6\n\nP3-P4\n\nP2\n\nP1 Qz\n\nSemi-flint kaolin\n\nTertiary deposits\n\nSoft kaolin\n\n1\n\n2\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n1\n\n2\n\nA)\n\nB)N\n\nQz Quartz sand grains and pebbles\n\nTrace fossil\n\nReactivation surface\nDouble mud couplet (tidal bundle)\n\nGlossifungites Ichnofacies\nFracture and fault\nIn situ  laterite \nconcretion\n(paleosol)\n\nHeterolithic bedded mudstone/sandstone\n\nSoft intraformational conglomerate/coarse-\ngrained sandstone with mudstone intraclast\n\nUpper flow regime, parallel laminated sandstone\n\nEndured brecciated argillite/argillite with fitted\n lamination/intraformational conglomerate /\nmassive, mottled/ferrified, endured argillite/pelite \n\nLag of laterite and argillite \nLaminated argillite\n\nQz\n\nLens or ball of massive or crudely cross-\nstratified sandstone\n\nLow-angle, mostly planar cross-stratified (laminated) sandstone\n\n \nFigure 2.2: Measured lithostratigraphic profiles (A) and geologic cross-section (B) illustrating the \nsedimentologic characteristics and spatial distributions of facies and facies associations present in \nthe soft kaolin unit of the Ipixuna Formation in the PPSA quarry.

Where the base of these deposits is \n\nexposed, an unconformity (cf. Rossetti, 2004) marked by a lag of mudstone clasts and iron-\n\ncemented, coarse-grained to pebbly sandstones separates them from the underlying Albian to \n\nCenomanian rocks (Rossetti and Santos Jr., 2003). The top of the soft kaolin unit is also an \n\nunconformity, marked by a paleosol that local displays a thin (up to 20 cm thick) interval of \n\nlateritic concretions overlain by the semi-flint kaolin unit (Santos Jr. and Rossetti, 2003).  \n\nDespite the high degree of kaolinitization, which is primarily due to replacement of lithic \n\ngrains and detritic clay minerals, the soft kaolin is characterized by well-developed primary \n\nstratification, providing the basis for reconstructing the depositional processes and \n\npaleoenvironmental settings. Based on geometry, sedimentary structures, grain sizes, and suite of \n\ntrace fossils, four intergradational facies associations were recognized and attributed to (Figs. 2 \n\nand 3): 1. tidally-influenced fluvial channel (Facies Association A); 2. tidal channel (Facies \n\nAssociation B); 3. tidal flat/mangrove (Facies Association C); and 4. tidal sand bar/tidal sandy \n\nflat (Facies Association D). Facies Association A, dominant in the base of the studied quarries, \n\ngrades upward into deposits that show stronger tidal influence producing a typical fining-upward \n\nsuccessions. Facies associations B and C are better developed in the PPSA quarry, whereas \n\nFacies Association D is more abundant in the RCC quarry.  \n\n \n\n2.4.1 Facies Association A: Tidally influenced Fluvial Channel \n \n\nFacies association A (Fig. 3A-E) is up to 5.5 m thick and occurs at the base of the soft \n\nkaolin deposits, where it consists primarily of sandstones composed of abundant quartz grains. \n\nIntraformational conglomerates and heterolithic mudstones/sandstones are also present. This \n\nfacies association comprises fining- and thinning-upward packages that are up to 2.5 m thick and \n\nare bounded at the base by erosional discontinuity surfaces. Where exposures are laterally \n\ncontinuous, the basal surface of the fining/thinning-upward successions displays a broad concave \n\nupward shape, up to 300 m wide (Fig. 3A-D). Trace fossils are very rare in this facies association, \n\nincluding only undetermined vertical burrows. \n\n 20\n\n\n\n 21\n\nThree facies are present in this association including, in order of decreasing abundance: \n\ntabular/trough cross-stratified or laminated sandstone (Facies St);  intraformational conglomerate \n\n(Facies Ci); and heterolithic mudstone/sandstone (Facies Ht). The sandstones (Fig. 3E) are, in \n\ngeneral, poorly sorted, consist of sub-rounded, coarse- to medium-grained sands, and display \n\ntabular and trough cross-stratification or cross-lamination (Facies St), the latter with set \n\nthicknesses averaging 0.3 m and less than 5 cm, respectively. The cross sets, which typically \n\ndecrease in size upward, dip consistently at low angles (typically between 10-20o). Although they \n\ndip dominantly to the N/NE, oppositely dipping S/SW cross sets are common in this facies (Fig. \n\n3D). Additionally, reactivation surfaces are abundant and define foreset packages averaging 10 \n\ncm thick, which are locally marked by mud drapes (Fig. 2).  \n\nFacies Ci is dominantly confined to the base of the fining-upward successions, and \n\nconsists of poorly sorted conglomerates composed of clasts of laminated mudstones.  These \n\naverage 5 cm in diameter, and occur mixed with poorly sorted quartz granules. Sedimentary \n\nstructures, where present, are incipient and dominated by crude trough cross stratification and \n\nnormal grading.  \n\nFacies Ht consists of interbedded, fine to very fine-grained sandstones and laminated \n\nmudstones that form wavy and lenticular beddings. This facies is only locally found at the top of \n\nsome fining/thinning upward successions, where it forms beds that are less than 0.4 m thick.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 21\n\n\n\n 22\n\n?\n\n1m\n\nA)\nC)\n\nB)\n\n1m 1m\n\n2\n\n1 1\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nC) C)\n\nSemi-flint kaolin\nTidal flat/mangrove\nTidal sand flat/tidal sand bar\n\nCoarse grained-sandstone (quartzose)\nCovered\n\nTidally-influenced fluvial channel/\n(1) Sandy and (2) Heterolithic tidal channel\n\nTidal Channel/\n(1) Sandy and (2) Heterolithic tidal channel\n\nCoarse grained-sandstone\n\n1m\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n2\n\n22\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n1 1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nD)\n\nE)\n\nE)\n\n \nFigure 2.3: A-D) Representative geologic sections, illustrating the sedimentologic characteristics \nand spatial distributions of facies and facies associations of the soft kaolin unit of the Ipixuna \nFormation in the RCC quarry.

E) Close-up photograph of tidal-influenced fluvial channel deposits (Facies Association \nA), showing foreset packages with mud drapes (arrows). \n\n 22\n\n\n\n 23\n\nInterpretation: Facies Association A is attributed to tidal-influenced fluvial channels. The \n\npresence of deposits with concave upward basal surfaces, though not exclusive to, is suggestive \n\nof flow confinement within channels. Where this feature is not present, the fining/thinning- \n\nupward facies successions are bounded by sharp, erosional basal surfaces, and attest to deposition \n\nduring decreasing flow energy, as typical of channel fills. Facies Ci records episodes of highest \n\nenergy, when channels were scoured into underlying muddy deposits. The muddy accumulations \n\nwere eroded and re-deposited as lags at the channel bottom. Facies St was formed by migration of \n\nsmall to medium scale, 2D- and 3D-bedforms within channels, and Facies Ht records alternating \n\nsand and mud deposition formed as topset beds during channel abandonment.  \n\nFacies Association A is attributed to tidal-influenced fluvial channels formed in proximal \n\nestuarine areas, near the limits of the fluvial realm. Although weak, tidal currents might reach \n\nthese inner estuarine areas and rework sediments brought from the fluvial channels. The \n\nrecognition of this type of setting in the geological record might be problematic (e.g., Ashley and \n\nRenwick, 1983; Allen, 1991; Hori et al., 2001; Leckie and Singh, 1991; Dalrymple et al., 1992; \n\nPlink-Bjorklund, 2005), particularly where the distribution of the depositional environments \n\nthroughout a proximal-distal transect cannot be observed, as in the case of the study area. \n\nHowever, the poor sorting, very coarse sand to gravel grain sizes, and scarcity or absence of \n\nbioturbation are features that led to claim a fluvial origin for this facies association, \n\ndistinguishing it from other channel deposits formed under dominant tidal processes (see Facies \n\nAssociation B described below).  \n\nFacies Association A displays features that cannot be justified exclusively by \n\nunidirectional fluvial flows. The bipolar paleocurrent data, coupled with the common reactivation \n\nsurfaces and mud drapes separating packages of foresets, are features suggestive of some degree \n\nof tidal reworking. The dominance of foresets dipping consistently at low angles is a further \n\nevidence of tidal influence, as migration of 2D- and 3D-bedforms in tidal settings typically \n\nresults in cross sets that display low angle dipping foresets (Shanley et al., 1992; Plink-\n\nBjorklund, 2005).  \n\nConsidering the foregoing interpretation, it is noteworthy that the position of Facies \n\nAssociation A, lying at the base of the soft kaolin unit, is a situation expected when a fluvial \n\nsystem is flooded during a transgression to form an estuarine valley (e.g., Dalrymple et al., 1992; \n\nZaitlin et al., 1994). \n\n 23\n\n\n\n 24\n\n2.4.2 Facies Association B: Tidal Channel  \n \n\nFacies Association B (Figs. 3D, 4 and 5) is up to 10 m thick and consists of : tabular and \n\ntrough cross-stratified/laminated sandstone (Facies St) and horizontal laminated sandstone \n\n(Facies Sh), alternating sandstone and mudstone displaying heterolithic bedding (Facies Ht), and \n\nsubordinate intraformational conglomerate (Facies Ci). These deposits, which are typically \n\nbounded at the base by broad concave upward surfaces with lengths of up to 200 m (Figs. 4A-C), \n\nare internally organized into fining- and thinning-upward successions averaging 3 m thick. More \n\nrarely, this facies association comprises entire intervals of heterolithic bedding (Fig 4B and C), \n\nwhich are cut internally by multiple erosive basal concave upward surfaces that are locally \n\nmantled by intraformational conglomerate.  \n\nFacies St consists of moderately sorted, coarse- to very fine-grained, tabular and trough \n\ncross-stratified sandstones having grains that are mostly subangular to subrounded. The cross \n\nsets, up to 0.3 m thick, consistently display low angle foresets. Paleocurrent measurements \n\nindicate main vectors to the NNE and SSW (Fig. 3D). A typical feature of Facies St is stacked \n\npackages of foresets averaging 5-10 cm thick that are defined by reactivation surfaces and/or \n\nmudstone drapes. Facies St locally grades laterally into fine- to very fine-grained, horizontal \n\nlaminated sandstone (facies Sh). The sandstones are, in general, moderately sorted with \n\nsubrounded grains and form packages that are 0.1-0.2 m thick, and commonly bounded by mud \n\ndrapes.  \n\nFacies Ht comprises alternating layers of medium- to fine-grained sandstone and \n\nmudstone, forming wavy, lenticular and flaser bedding, that might dip at low angles (i.e., >10o). \n\nIndividual lithological packages are up to 20 cm thick. Thicknesses of sandstone and mudstone \n\nbeds are not constant upwards, rather varying progressively into alternating thicker and thinner \n\nbundles, the latter displaying a higher concentration of mud layers (Fig. 4D and E). The \n\nsandstone layers are moderately to well sorted. Thicker sandstone layers are internally \n\ncharacterized by plane parallel stratification, cross stratification, or are structureless. Locally, \n\ncross strata display oppositely dipping foresets. The mudstone and siltstone may display parallel \n\nlamination or appear massive.  \n\nFacies Ci occurs locally, typically mantling concave upward surfaces. It consists of sub-\n\nangular to sub-rounded mudstone and sandstone intraclasts up to 20 cm in diameter. Facies Ci is \n\ngenerally massive, or displays crude trough cross-stratification and normal grading. \n\n 24\n\n\n\n 25\n\nA typical feature of Facies Association B is the abundance and variety of trace fossils, \n\nincluding Thalassinoides, Planolites, Teichichnus, Taenidium and Skolithos (Fig. 5). \n\n 25\n\n\n\n 26\n\nTidalflat/mangrove\n (Facies Association C)\nTidal channel \n(Facies Association B)\n\nB)\n\nA)\n\nCovered\n\n1m\n\nS\n\nS\n\nS\n\nS\n\nS\n\nS\n\nS\nS\n\nS\n\nS\n\n15 cm\n\nSandstone\n\nMudstone\n\nC)\n\nD)\n\nE)\n\nHeterolithic tidal channel \n\n \nFigure 2.4: Tidal channel (Facies Association B) and tidal flat/mangrove (Facies Association C). \nA) Geologic section illustrating the spatial relationship between facies associations B and C.

The \n\ninternal organization, configuring thinning- and fining-upward successions formed by the upward \n\ngradation from intraformational conglomerates to sandstones and into heterolithic bedding of \n\nsandstone and mudstones, attests to deposition during waning flow, typical of channels prone to \n\nlateral accretion. \n\nInternal features that favor channel deposition under the influence of tidal currents \n\ninclude: 1) an abundance of reactivation surfaces and mud drapes within cross sets; 2) oppositely \n\ndipping foresets; 3) low-angle dipping cross sets; and 4) alternating thicker and thinner packages \n\nof sandstones and mudstones within the heterolithic facies. Generation of all these structures \n\nrequires fluctuating current energy, as occurs most typically in tidal settings In particular, the \n\nsuccessions of alternating thicker and thinner bundles of the heterolithic facies are attributed to \n\nsediment aggradation under influence of tidal currents that vary in strength and duration on a \n\ndaily and monthly basis. The alternations of sandier and muddier packages may be related to \n\nneap-spring tidal variations (Nio and Yang, 1991). The typical fining/thinning upward \n\nsuccessions suggest that tidal channels filled up more or less continuously during rising sea level \n\n(Dalrymple et al., 1992).  \n\nThe proposed deposition by tidal processes in brackish water conditions is consistent with \n\nthe ichnologic assemblage described in this facies association. The low-diversity association of \n\nOphiomorpha, Thalassinoides, Planolites, Teichichnus, Taenidium and Skolithos is consistent \n\nwith deposition in nearshore settings influenced by stressed environmental conditions (Benynon \n\nand Pemberton, 1992; MacEachern and Pemberton, 1994; Pemberton et al., 2001; Uchman et al., \n\n2004). \n\nConsidering the proposed tidal channel interpretation for Facies Association B, the \n\ninclined heterolithic strata (Facies Ht) are related to lateral accretion on tidally influenced point \n\nbars, with sandstones and mudstones recording high and low tidal flow stages, respectively. This \n\ntype of deposit is usually associated to the presence of channels with high sinuosity (Thomas et \n\nal., 1987; Smith, 1988; Fenies and Faug\u00e8res, 1998; Nouidar and Chella\u00ef, 2001; Mack et al., 2003; \n\nGao, 2004; Plink-Bjorklund, 2005).  \n\nSedimentary and biogenic features similar to the ones recorded here have been found in \n\nassociation with many tidal channel deposits described in the literature (e.g., Clifton, 1983; \n\n 28\n\n\n\n 29\n\nSmith, 1988; De Boer, 1989; Leckie and Singh, 1991; Nio and Yang, 1991; Plink-Bjorklund, \n\n2005). \n\n \n\n \n2.4.3 Facies Association C \u2013 Tidal Flat/?Mangrove \n  \n\nFacies Association C (Fig. 4A) is better developed in the PPSA quarry, is up to 5 m thick, \n\nand records the finest deposits of the soft kaolin unit. It consists essentially of tabular packages of \n\ndistinctively yellow to red colored, highly bioturbated, heterolithic-bedded sandstones and \n\nmudstones. These deposits are laterally continuous for up to 1 km and are intergraded with facies \n\nassociations B and D. \n\nThis association is internally characterized by an overall fining- and thinning-upward \n\nsuccession, and consists of only two facies: heterolithic mudstone/sandstone (Facies Ht) and \n\nmudstone (Facies M). Like Facies Association B, Facies Ht, represented mostly by linsen, is \n\norganized into several minor cycles of 0.3-0.4 cm. Then form packages of sandstones and \n\nmudstones that progressively change their thickness, varying from thicker to thinner upward (Fig. \n\n3). Facies M consists of thicker packages of mudstones displaying only streaks of coarse-grained \n\nsiltstones and very fine-grained sandstones.  \n\nFacies Association C is highly bioturbated, mainly recording traces that are comparable to \n\nthose of the previous association. One except on is the absence of Skolithos and Ophiomorpha. \n\n \n\nInterpretation: Facies Association C is interpreted as the record of tidal flat settings, which might \n\nhave been associated with mangroves, though root marks were not recognized probably to the \n\nintense kalinitization. A tidal flat is consistent with the intergrading of this facies association with \n\nFacies Association B (Tidal Channel) and Facies Association D (Tidal Sand Flat/Sand Bar). \n\nDeposition in a flat-lying area is suggested by the tabular geometry and great lateral continuity of \n\nthe association. The mudstones indicate deposition from suspensions in low energy \n\nenvironments, while the heterolithic deposits conform to a setting with alternating traction \n\nsediment transport and deposition from suspensions (Collinson, 1996). In addition to a genetic \n\nassociation with other tidal deposits, the upward change in thickness of sand/mud bundles of the \n\nheterolithic facies attests to tidal currents as the main depositional process. \n\n 29\n\n\n\n 30\n\n The sole occurrence of heterolithic deposits and mudstones in Facies Association C \n\nsuggests intertidal and supratidal deposition. The progradation of heterolithic deposits into \n\nmudstones produces a vertical fining-upward succession, consistent with tidal flat progadation \n\n(Klein, 1985). The thickness of the tidal flat succession in the study area indicates a macrotidal \n\nregime, with a minimum paleotidal range of 5 m. \n\nThe ichnologic assemblage is used as a further confirmation of the proposed depositional \n\nsetting. Hence, like Facies Association B, the trace fossils are typical of estuarine environments. \n\nThe absence of Ophiomorpha and Skolithos is due to decreases in energy, as these traces are \n\nmore common in high-energy environments. Ophiomorpha and Skolithos are also typical of areas \n\nsubjected to high sedimentation mobility (Zonneveld et al., 2001; Malpas et al., 2005; Savary et \n\nal., 2004).  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4.4 Facies Association D \u2013 Upper Flow Regime Tidal Sand Flat/Sand Bar \n \n\nFacies Association D (Fig. 6A-G), up to 5 m, is very widespread in both of the studied \n\nquarries, where it grades laterally and vertically into facies associations B and C (Figs. 1 and 2). \n\nLike Facies Association C, these deposits are laterally continuous, forming tabular packages that \n\nare bounded at the base by either planar or only slightly undulating (though not erosive) surfaces. \n\nThese deposits might also be lenticular, with lenses up to 0.4 m thick and 6 m long. Fining- and \n\nthickening-upward cycles are present. \n\nThis facies association differentiates from the previous association on the basis of \n\npredominance of horizontally stratified sandstones (Fig. 6A), with subordinate heterolithic \n\ndeposits (Facies H). The sandstone consists of three facies: horizontal-laminated to low-angle \n\ndipping cross-stratified sandstones (Facies Shl), tabular- and trough cross-stratified sandstones \n\n(Facies St), and climbing current ripple cross-laminated sandstones (Facies Sc). These facies are \n\ncharacterized by well-sorted, well-rounded, fine- to very fine-grained sandstones, displaying high \n\nconcentrations of heavy minerals on plane beddings (Fig. 6B). Sets in Facies Shl, which \n\ndominates in this association, ranges in thickness from 0.4-0.5 m, and indicates northward \n\npaleoflows. An interesting feature of Facies Sc is the abundance of parting lineations, which \n\nindicate a NE/SW azimuth for paleoflow (Fig. 6C). Other features associated with Facies Shl are \n\npinch and swell structures and symmetrical (oscillation) ripple marks. In addition, undulating \n\n 30\n\n\n\n 31\n\nlaminations displaying internal truncations are common and form broad scours or swales with \n\neither symmetrical or asymetrical geometries (Fig. 6D). Facies Sc occurs only locally, being \n\ncharacterized by tabular or highly undulating lower set boundaries. Facies St and Sc are \n\nsubordinate, and intergrade with facies Shl. Facies St alternates rhythmically with Facies Shl, \n\nresulting in individual packages 10-20 cm thick. \n\nHeterolithic mudstone/sandstone (Facies Ht), alternating with trough cross-stratified \n\nsandstone (Facies St), occurs as lenses averaging 0.5 m thick and 8 m long. These are interbedded \n\nwith the tabular sandstone described above. The sandstones show well-rounded, well sorted, fine- \n\nto medium-grained sand, and display cross lamination and small- to medium-scale cross \n\nstratification. Locally, cross sets with abundant reactivation surfaces and highly undulating set \n\nboundaries are present. Facies Ht and St are typically arranged into coarsening- and thickening- \n\nupward successions.  \n\nTrace fossils dispersed in this facies association consist of Thalassinoides, Ophiomorpha, \n\nSkolithos, and Planolites (Fig. 6E-G).  \n\n 31\n\n\n\n 32\n\nS\nOp?\n\nPl\n\n10cm\n\nE) F)\n\nA)\n\nD)\n\nTh\n\nG)\n\n1cm 2 cm 1cm \n\n5cm10cm\n\n1 m\n\nB) C)\n\n \nFigure 2.6: Upper flow regime tidal sand flat/sand bar (Facies Association D).

These characteristics imply deposition along a shallow flat area. The abundance of \n\nparting lineation in Facies Shl indicates that sediment accumulation took place during prevailing \n\nupper-flow-regime conditions (Reineck and Singh, 1980; Yagishita et al., 2004). The rhythmic \n\nalternation of Facies Shl and Facies St indicates fluctuating conditions from upper to lower flow \n\nregime. Considering the overall proposed depostional setting, these facies might have been the \n\nproduct of tidal processes. The presence of swell and pinch, symmetrical ripple marks, and the \n\nlarge swales indicate frequent wave reworking (e.g., de Raaf et al., 1977). In particular, scours \n\nsimilar to the ones described here (Figure 6C) are common in nearshore areas that have \n\nundergone periods of higher energy flow, suggesting storm wave reworking (e.g., Bourgeois, \n\n1980; Cheel and Leckie, 1993; Hori et al., 2001; Plink-Bjorklund, 2005). The abundance of \n\nheavy minerals is consistent with flux and reflux.  \n\n The above mentioned characteristics, added to the gradation of Facies Association D with \n\nthe other facies associations described herein support deposition in an upper flow regime tidal \n\nsand flat depositional setting (see also Klein, 1985; MuCubbin, 1988; Plink-Bjorklund, 2005). \n\nThe lateral gradation of tidal sand flat deposits with sandstone lenses displaying  fining- \n\nand thickening-upward cycles are suggestive of significant volume of sand accumulation along a \n\nseries of tidal sand bars. Many ancient tidal sand bars are recorded by similar upward-coarsening \n\nlenticular sandstone bodies (Houthuys and Gullentops, 1988; Dalrymple, et al. 1992; Reading \n\nand Collinson, 1996; Willis, 2000; Heap et al., 2004). Tidal bars are commonly recorded in \n\nassociation with upper flow regime tidal sand flat deposits in confined areas along coasts \n\ndominated by high tidal velocities (Dalrymple et al., 1992; Plink-Bjorklund, 2005).  \n\nThe ichnological assemblage, represented by disperse traces of mostly Thalassinoides is \n\nin agreement with the proposed setting, since these traces form typically in nearshore areas \n\nundergone to episodic or constant environmental changes (Wightman et al. 1987; MacEachern \n\nand Pemberton 1992; Pollard et al. 1993; Gowland 1996).  \n\n \n\n 33\n\n\n\n 34\n\n2.5 DISCUSSION OF THE DEPOSITIONAL SYSTEM \n\n \n\nThe new facies data presented herein confirms tidal currents as the main process \n\nresponsible for deposition of the soft kaolin unit of the Ipixuna Formation. Evidence for tidal \n\nprocesses includes the abundance of cross sets with reactivation surfaces, commonly mantled by \n\nmud drapes, the local presence of tidal bundles, and reversed foresets. The ichnological \n\nassemblage represented by low diversity of traces, consisting of Thalassinoides, Planolites, \n\nTeichichnus, Taenidium, Skolithos  and Ophiomorpha, attests a nearshore setting with stressing \n\nwater conditions due to the mixture of marine and freshwater inflows. This, together with the \n\nvariety of facies associations interpreted above, is consistent with a tide-dominated estuarine \n\nmodel (Fig. 7). \n\n \n\n \n\n 34\n\n\n\n 35\n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.7: Schematic block diagram depicting the tidal dominated estuarine depositional model \n(after Dalrymple et al., 1992) proposed for the soft kaolin in the Rio Capim area. (1=profile in the \nRCC quarry; 2=profile in the PPSA quarry). \n\n 35\n\n\n\n 36\n\nA previous study of the Ipixuna Formation had tentatively suggested the action of tidal \n\ncurrents during its deposition. This paper, however, demonstrates that tidal processes were much \n\nmore significant than initially thought, and controlled most of the sediment accumulation in all of \n\nthe depositional environments identified in the soft kaolin unit. In addition, mapping of new \n\nexposures has led to a more complete characterization of the various facies associations and their \n\nspatial relationships.  \n\nA proposed correlation of the tidal deposits of the Ipixuna Formation from the studied \n\nquarries exposed along the Road BR-010, located 60 km apart, led to the proposal of a wave-\n\ndominated estuarine system for the soft kaolin unit (Santos Jr. and Rossetti, 2003). The data \n\npresented herein, however, support depositional settings that are more consistent with a tide-\n\ndominated estuarine model. A possibility exists, thus, that the tidal delta deposits present along \n\nthe Road BR-010 are not correlatable with the soft kaolin unit. These tidal delta deposits might \n\ncorrespond to either an adjacent depositional system or a part of a barrier complex associated \n\nwith the subsequent stage of the estuary evolution with increased influence of wave action.  \n\nThe genetic association of tidal-influenced fluvial channel, tidal channel, tidal \n\nflat/mangrove, and tidal sand bar/tidal sandy flat deposits, is typical of tidal dominated estuarine \n\nsystem for the soft unit (e.g., Woodroffe et al., 1989; Leckie and Singh, 1991; Dalrymple et al., \n\n1992; Harris et al., 1992; Chappell and Woodroffe, 1994; Mulrennan and woodroffe, 1998; Hori \n\net al., 2001; Heap et al., 2004; Plink-Bjorklund, 2005). An abundance of tidal channel deposits \n\nthat interfinger with sand bar and upper flow regime sand flat deposits are more commonly \n\nrecorded in tide-dominated estuaries formed along mesotidal to macrotidal coast (Klein, 1985; \n\nHouthuys and Gullentops, 1988; Buatois and Mangano, 2003). Tidal bar and sand flat deposits \n\nhad been previously recognized in the study area, but were thought to be volumetrically \n\nsubordinate, have formed when upper flow regimes developed within channels (Santos Jr. and \n\nRossetti, 2003). The newly available exposures reveal, however, that they constitute one of the \n\nmain facies associations of the soft kaolin unit, second only to tidal deposits. \n\nThe distribution of the studied deposits, both vertically and laterally, provides information \n\nfor interpreting the estuary evolution. The tidal-influenced, fluvial-channel deposits (Facies \n\nAssociation A), which are dominant near the base of the kaolin unit, attest to formation in inner \n\nestuarine areas. These deposits characterize the transition between fluvial and tidal sedimentation, \n\nthus displaying characteristics that are inherent from both fluvial and tidal processes (Dalrymple \n\n 36\n\n\n\n 37\n\net al., 1992; Hori et al., 2001; Cooper, 2002). Features diagnostic of tidal processes, such tidal \n\nbundles, are scarce or even absent from such settings due to the interference of fluvial influx \n\n(Leckie and Singh, 1991; Hori et. al., 2001; Cooper, 2002; Heap et al., 2004). The velocity \n\nfluctuation of tidal currents results in highly unsteady flows, producing frequent reactivation \n\nsurfaces with mud drapes, as observed in Facies Association A. The abundance of these surfaces \n\nseparating foreset packages that are only few cm thick, facilitates the differentiation of tidal \n\ninfluence from other disturbances in fluvial system (e.g., seasonal fluctuations; Ladipo, 1988; \n\nThorez et al., 1988). \n\nThe overall vertical gradation from tide-influenced fluvial channel (Facies Association A) \n\nto tidal channel (Facies Association B), tidal flat/mangrove (Facies Association C) and tidal sand \n\nbar/sand flat deposits (Facies Association D) records upward increasing tidal influence. As a \n\nresult, features attributed to, or even diagnostic (e.g., tidal bundles) of tidal currents become \n\nprogressively more abundant upward, as do the trace fossils Thalassinoides, Ophiomorpha, \n\nPlanolithes, Teichichnus, Taenidium and Skolithos, typical of coastal settings. The upward \n\nincrease in tidal influence is also associated with a progressive increase in mud abundances, \n\nresulting in thinning- and fining- upward successions. Such facies arrangements are related to a \n\nrise in relative sea level during transgression. \n\nInclined heterolithic stratification (HIS) in association with tidal channel deposits is \n\nexpected in meanders of straight-meandering-straight channel segments, typically formed in \n\ncentral estuarine areas of tidal-dominated estuaries (e.g., Nichols and Biggs, 1985; Leckie and \n\nSingh, 1991; Dalrymple et al., 1992; Reading and Collison, 1996; Plink-Bjorklund, 2005). The \n\nmore frequent occurrence of tidal channel deposits in the PPSA quarry might suggest that, when \n\ntransgression took place, this area was located closer to the central estuary. \n\nOn the other hand, the higher abundance of Facies Association D in the RCC quarry \n\nsuggests a location nearer to the coast, as elongate sand bars associated with upper-flow-regime \n\nsand flats are typical of the seaward areas in tide-dominated estuaries (Dalrymple et al., 1992). \n\nThe common occurrence of wave-generated structures (i.e, symmetrical ripple marks and \n\ntruncating, low-angle dipping cross lamination) in facies association D conforms to an outer \n\nestuarine location (Dalrymple et al. 1992).  \n\nThe soft kaolin deposits in the Rio Capim Kaolin area were formed during a period of rise \n\nrelative sea level, with the RCC quarry recording an increased proximity to nearshore areas \n\n 37\n\n\n\n 38\n\nrelative to the PPSA quarry. The tide-dominated estuary formed along a broad WNW-ESE \n\npaleocoast, as proposed by the dominant NNE/SSW and NE/SW paleocurrent data obtained from \n\nthe in-channel deposits. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.6 CONCLUSION \n\n \n\nThe presence of sedimentary structures attributed to tidal processes coupled with trace \n\nfossil assemblages consisting of Thalassinoides, Planolites, Teichichnus, Taenidium, Skolithos \n\nand Ophiomorpha, suggest that the soft kaolin unit of the Ipixuna Formation in the Rio Capim \n\nKaolin area was formed dominantly under the influence of tidal processes. In addition to facies \n\nassociations consisting of tidal-influenced fluvial channel, tidal channel, tidal flat/mangrove, and \n\ntidal sand bar/tidal sand flat, these characteristics support a tide-dominated estuarine \n\ninterpretation. The distribution of facies associations, represented by tide-influenced fluvial \n\nchannel deposits that grade upward into other facies associations denoting increased tidal energy, \n\nindicates that deposition took place during a transgression. The increased occurrence of tidal \n\nchannel, tidal flat/mangrove deposits in the PPSA quarry, and of tidal sand bar/tidal sandy flat in \n\nthe RCC quarry reveals that the latter was located closer to the nearshore area. During the Late \n\nCretaceous, the paleocoast was positioned circa 240 km landward of the present coast, as a result \n\nof relative sea-level rise. This depositional context must be taken into account when discussing \n\nthe origin of the soft kaolin in the Rio Capim area. \n\n 38\n\n\n\n 39\n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\nALLEN, G.P., 1991.

ORIGIN OF THE RIO CAPIM KAOLIN WITH BASIS ON OPTICAL \n\n(PETROGRAPHIC AND SEM) DATA \n\n \n \n\nAnt\u00f4nio Em\u00eddio de Ara\u00fajo SANTOS Jr. \n\nand Dilce de F\u00e1tima ROSSETTI \n\n \n3.1 ABSTRACT \n\n \n\n The Ipixuna Formation (Late Cretaceous-?Early Tertiary) exposed in the Rio Capim area, \n\nnorthern Brazil, was subdivided recently into three stratigraphic horizons, informally known as \n\nthe lower soft kaolin unit, the intermediate kaolin unit, and the upper, endured, semi-flint kaolin \n\nunit. These units had their primary texture and composition strongly modified after deposition. \n\nPetrographic and scanning electronic microscopic (SEM) investigation revealed many remaining \n\nfeatures that allow distinguishing the soft and the semi-flint kaolin deposits into two depositional \n\nsequences. The soft kaolin unit consists of well structured, sub-angular to sub-rounded, and \n\nlocally angular, kaolinitized quartzose sandstones and kaolinitized sandstones that are \n\ninterbedded with either laminated or massive pelites. These lithologies, composed by grains and \n\nlithic fragments related to felsic volcanic and meta-volcanic sources, as well as metamorphic and \n\ngranitic rocks, had their texture and composition strongly modified, mostly likely during \n\ndiagenesis, resulting deposits with an actual wacky nature. Kaolinitization produced three types \n\nof kaolinites, categorized according to size and texture, as Ka, Kb and Kc kaolinites. Ka \n\nkaolinite, typical of the sandstones, consists of hexagonal to pseudohexagonal crystals 10-30 \u00b5m \n\nin diameter, and occurs as agglomerates of booklets or vermicular crystals that reach up to 400 \n\n\u00b5m in length. Kb kaolinite, which dominates in the mudstones, consists chiefly of hexagonal and \n\npseudohexagonal crystals averaging 1-3 \u00b5m in diameter that occur isolated, or as intergrowths of \n\nchaotic, face-to face or, less commonly, parallel to pseudo-parallel crystals. Kc kaolinite, which \n\nis abundant only in association with paleosols, displays hexagonal to pseudohexagonal crystals \n\nwith regular sizes around 200 nm in diameter. The semi-flint is attributed to a distinctive \n\ndepositional unit formed by sediments from variable sources, but with a significant contribution \n\nfrom the underlying soft kaolin. This is suggested by a high volume of sandstones displaying \n\ngrains that are sub-rounded to rounded and consisting of homogeneous, dark brown masses of \n\n 45\n\n\n\n 46\n\nkaolinite that are strongly highlighted by films of iron oxides. As opposed to the soft kaolin unit, \n\nthe semi-flint is dominated by endured Kc kaolinite, which mostly likely results from \n\ncombination of weathering during transportation and pedogenesis acting in several phases of \n\nsediment subaerial exposure.  \n\n \n\nKeywords: Petrology, Rio Capim kaolin, Camet\u00e1 Sub-basin, kaolinite, origin, source area. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2 INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nThe Ipixuna Formation that occurs in the Camet\u00e1 Sub-basin, northern Brazil, is a \n\ngeological unit of great economic interest for bearing one of the largest kaolin deposits in the \n\nworld, the Rio Capim Kaolin. This unit has been investigated by several workers, who have \n\nmostly emphasized its sedimentologic, stratigraphic and geochemical aspects (G\u00f3es 1981; Sousa \n\n2000; Santos Jr. 2002; Rossetti and Santos Jr. 2003; Santos Jr. and Rossetti 2003). One \n\nimportant issue still open for debate concerning to these deposits is to decipher the origin of the \n\nkaolinite in order to better develop exploitation methods. Previous studies have suggested that the \n\nRio Capim Kaolin is a product of deep weathering related to progressive drop of ground water \n\naffecting a single stratigraphic unit (Truckenbrodt et al. 1991; Kotschoubey et al. 1996; 1999; \n\nCosta and Moraes 1998; Sousa 2000). Despite these contributions, the origin of these kaolin \n\ndeposits deserves to be further addressed considering newly available sedimentological and \n\nstratigraphic data (Santos Jr. 2002; Rossetti and Santos Jr. 2003; Santos Jr. and Rossetti \n\n2003). According to these authors, the kaolin deposits do not conform to a single stratigraphic \n\nunit. An unconformity separates the Ipixuna Formation into a lower soft kaolin unit and an upper \n\nhard kaolin unit, the latter consisting of flint-like fire clay with no plasticity when grounds up, \n\nknown as semi-flint. Therefore, the soft and the semi-flint kaolin units have been attributed to \n\ndistinctive depositional sequences. Additionally, a thin package of highly deformed deposits \n\nattributed to syn-sedimentary seismic activity is locally found between these two sequences, \n\nwhich are bounded by discontinuity surfaces that laterally merge into the sequence boundary \n\n(Rossetti and Santos Jr. 2003).  \n\n 46\n\n\n\n 47\n\nTaking this geological framework into account, a detailed characterization of various \n\ntypes of kaolinite according to the stratigraphic horizons recognized within the Ipixuna \n\nFormation is required to provide new information that can serve to the purpose of further \n\ndiscussing the origin of the Rio Capim Kaolin. Two types of kaolinite have been characterized in \n\nthis area. These consist of a finer-grained kaolinite with high structural disorder, and a coarser-\n\ngrained kaolinite with lower structural disorder, this occurring mostly as booklets (Kotschoubey \n\net al. 1999). According to these authors, these types of kaolinite reflect lithological \n\ndifferences. Hence, the finer-grained kaolinites formed from replacement of clay mineral in \n\nmuddy deposits, while the coarser-grained kaolinites resulted from replacement of feldspar grains \n\nin sandy deposits.  \n\nThis paper provides detailed petrographic and scanning electronic microscopic (SEM) \n\ndescriptions of the kaolin units of the Rio Capim area (Fig. 1A) aiming to better understand the \n\norigin of the different types of kaolinites, as well as discuss their temporal relationships.  \n\n  \n\n \n\n3.3 GEOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK \n\n \n\n The Camet\u00e1 Sub-basin is inserted in the eastern margin of the Maraj\u00f3 Graben System, \n\nwhich formed in association with the opening of the Atlantic Ocean during the Late Jurassic to \n\nEarly Cretaceous (Azevedo 1991; Galv\u00e3o 1991; Villegas 1994; Costa et al. 2001). This sub-basin \n\nis filled by Cretaceous and Cenozoic deposits (Fig. 1B) that are up to 10 km thick. Cretaceous \n\ndeposits are represented by the Breves (Aptian-Cenomanian) and the Limoeiro (Late Cretaceous) \n\nformations, while the Cenozoic deposits include the Maraj\u00f3 (Paleocene-Eocene) and Tucunar\u00e9 \n\n(Pleistocene) formations. The majority of these deposits, formed in depositional settings ranging \n\nfrom fluvial to shallow marine (Villegas 1994), occurs in sub-surface. However, exceptional \n\nexposures are found along kaolin quarries in the Rio Capim area, where Upper Cretaceous-? \n\nLower Tertiary deposits (Jupiass\u00fa 1970) crop out, being known by the lithostratigraphic term of \n\nIpixuna Formation. This formation is up to 40 m thick, and consists of a lower soft kaolin unit, an \n\nintermediate kaolin unit, and an upper semi-flint kaolin unit (Fig. 2A), which are bounded by \n\ndiscontinuity surfaces, some marked by paleosols (Fig. 2A and B). The intermediate kaolin unit \n\noccurs only locally, and reaches up to 3 m thick. These deposits pinch out laterally, resulting in \n\n 47\n\n\n\n 48\n\ndirect superposition of the soft and the semi-flint kaolin units (Santos Jr. and Rossetti 2003; \n\nRossetti 2004).  \n\nDespite the kaolinitized muddy nature, many workers have shown that the kaolin units in \n\nthe Rio Capim area consist of lithologies varying from mudstones to conglomerates \n\n(Truckenbrodt et al. 1991; Kotschoubey et al. 1996; Santos Jr. and Rossetti 2003, 2006; Rossetti \n\nand Santos Jr. 2003, 2006; Rossetti 2004). The soft kaolin unit is well stratified, mostly \n\nencompassing sandy and muddy sedimentary facies attributed to tidal-influenced fluvial channel, \n\ntidal channel, tidal sand bar, sand flat and tidal flat/mangrove associated to a tidal estuarine \n\nsystem (Santos Jr. and Rossetti 2003, 2006). The intermediate kaolin unit, composed of \n\nheterolithic deposits, as well as mudstones and sandstones, forms a horizon bounded by \n\ndiscontinuity surfaces containing a variety of soft sediment deformation (e.g., convolute fold, \n\ncuspide, ball-and-pillow fracture, fault) structures related to seismic activity (Rossetti and Santos \n\nJr. 2003). The semi-flint kaolin unit, traditionally known as massive in nature, has been more \n\nrecently regarded as the record of distributary channels and mouth bars associated to either a \n\ndeltaic or wave-dominated estuarine setting (Rossetti and Santos Jr. 2006). According to these \n\nauthors, thin layers of quartzose sandstones present in these deposits are related to transgressive \n\nlags.  \n\n \n\n 48\n\n\n\n 49\n\n \n\n3\u00b0\n\n2\u00b0\n\n1\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0\n\n1\u00b0N\n48\u00b050\u00b0 46\u00b0W\n\n4\u00b0100km\n\nIpixuna\n\nParagominas\n\nIRCC\n\nPPSA\n\nBR-316\n\nTectonic\nLineament\nRoad\n\nSBM\n\nSBL\n\nSBM\n\nSBC\n\nBel\u00e9m\n\nCap\nim R\n\niver\nB\n\nR\n-0\n\n10\n\nMaraj\u00f3 Graben System\n\n? ?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\nE\nar\n\nly\nL\n\nat\ne\n\nC\nR\n\nE\nTA\n\nC\nE\n\nO\nU\n\nS\n\nAge\n\nLithostratigraphy\n\nSubsurface\n\n   Breves\nFormation\n\n  Limoeiro\nFormation\n\n  Maraj\u00f3 Formation\n\n Tucunar\u00e9 Formation\n\n    Ipixuna\n Formation\n\n Pirabas/Barreiras \n      Formation\n\n P\u00f3s-Barreiras Sediments\n\nUnamed Cretaceous\n          deposits\n\n   \n It\n\nap\nec\n\nur\nu \n\nG\nro\n\nup\n\nStudy area\n\n?\n\nA)\n\nB)\n\nQ\nU\n\nA\nT\n\nE\nR\n\nN\nA\n\nR\nY\n\nT\nE\n\nR\nT\n\nIA\nR\n\nY\nM araj\u00f3\nIsland\n\nS\u00e3o Lu\u00eds-Graja\u00fa\nBasin\n\nPar\u00e1 Platform\n\nBragantina \nPlatform\n\n \nFigure 3.1 A) Location of the study area in the eastern Camet\u00e1 Sub-Basin, Maraj\u00f3 Graben \nSystem, with indication of the two studied quarries, the IRCC and PPSA.

Sampling aimed to properly record the \n\nthree stratigraphic kaolin units, as well as their internal sedimentary facies. \n\nAll samples were impregnated with epoxy cements before starting thin section \n\npreparation, given their soft, and sometimes, friable nature. After this procedure, the samples \n\nwere cut and polished using a Logitech System. For the SEM analysis, both small fragments and \n\npowered samples were mounted on stubs using silver tape, in order to analyze texture and \n\nmorphology of individual kaolinite crystals. After gold coating, the samples were analysed under \n\na LEO 1450 VP electronic microscope from the Goeldi Museum, applying secondary electrons \n\nand backscattering. The study of SEM images was combined with EDS analysis in order to help \n\nidentifying the various mineral species. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.5 DESCRIPTION OF THE KAOLIN UNITS \n\n \n\nPetrographic and SEM analyses revealed particular optical characteristics when the soft \n\nand the semi-flint kaolin units of the Ipixuna Formation were compared, with abrupt changes \n\noccurring at their boundaries. On the other hand, the intermediate unit could not be distinguished \n\nfrom the semi-flint kaolin and for this reason they will be described together herein. The \n\nfollowing characterization of texture and mineralogy of the kaolin units takes into account only \n\nlithologies varying from sandstones to mudstones, and excludes conglomerates, also abundant in \n\nthe upper two kaolin units. Given the high degree of kaolinitization, the lithologic classification \n\nprovided below is far from representing a primary sediment composition. The most likely \n\noriginal sediment types are suggested in the discussions.  \n\n \n\n3.5.1 Soft kaolin \n \n\nThe soft kaolin unit is composed mainly by interbedded sandstone and pelite. The first, \n\nrepresenting the main lithology, includes kaolinitized quartzose sandstones and kaolinitized \n\n 51\n\n\n\n 52\n\nsandstones. Kaolinitized quartzose sandstones (Fig. 3A-H) dominate in the lower portion of the \n\nsoft kaolin unit. They vary from fine- to coarse-grained and are, in general, moderately to well \n\nsorted, with grains that are sub-angular to sub-rounded, and locally angular. Their framework \n\ncomposition (Fig. 3A) consists of quartz (about 40-60%), and secondarily muscovite, feldspar \n\nand lithics (<5%). The remaining of the sandstones is composed by a kaolinitized \u201cmatrix\u201d, as \n\nwell as large, rounded kaolinitized clasts up to 2 cm in length. The quartz grains are dominantly \n\nmonocrystalline, and have their boundaries displaying different degrees of replacement by \n\nkaolinite. Only relics of grains are found floating within the kaolinite masses where replacement \n\nwas more significant. In addition to the monocrystalline quartz, there is a significant volume of \n\nlimpid, either bipyramidal or cuneiform quartz grains with straight extinction, as well as \n\nnumerous vacuoles and embayments filled by either kaolinite or kaolinitized mud (Fig. 3B,C). \n\nMuscovite grains (Fig. 3D) are often bent and show anomalous birefringence due to partial \n\nreplacement by large kaolinite crystals. Feldspars (Fig. 3E,F) are altered and replaced by \n\nkaolinite. Where grains are better preserved, albite twinning was observed. The lithics (Fig. 3G) \n\nconsist mostly of mudstones and, secondarily, a mixture of muscovite, feldspar and quartz. These \n\ngrains, in general larger than the average framework grains, display either bipyramidal or \n\ncuneiform quartz crystals. These are orientated according to a main direction that matches to the \n\nmaximum elongation axis of muscovite crystals, suggesting an incipient foliation. The interstitial \n\nspace of the sandstones consists of a kaolinitized \u2018matrix\u201d often containing enlarged areas, as \n\nwell as ghosts of grains that were entirely kaolinitized (Fig. 3H). Where this \u201cmatrix\u201d is less \n\ncommon, the framework grains display punctual contacts. \n\nUpward in the sections, the sandstones become progressively less quartzose, given place \n\nto the kaolinitized sandstones. These sandstones are dominantly fine-grained, though medium and \n\neven coarse grain sizes are locally present. The contact between grains are punctual and, less \n\ncommonly, concave-convex. The grains, moderately sorted and sub-angular to angular, consist \n\nmainly of either partly or entirely kaolinited grains (Fig. 4A, D). Quartz, feldspar, muscovite and \n\nlithic grains are locally present. Bipyramidal (Fig. 4E) or cuneiform quartz grains are limpid or, \n\nmost commonly, occur as \u201cghosts\u201d with only relicts of the original composition. The latter \n\nconsists of numerous particles of a transparent mineral with low birefringence similar to quartz. \n\nThe remaining parts of these grains are highly replaced by kaolinite. Partly or entirely \n\nkaolinitized grains display a bipyramidal shape similar to quartz grains (Fig. 4F). The first shows \n\n 52\n\n\n\n 53\n\nmany relicts of the original mineral composition, which are alike those observed in the ghosts of \n\nquartz grains. A large volume of the kaolinitized grains, even those with bipyramidal shapes, \n\ndisplays numerous black inclusions (Fig. 4G) that are not present in the kaolinitized \u201cmatrix\u201d. \n\nLithic grains might display composition similar to the quarztoze sandstones described above or, \n\nmore often, are composed by a dark kaolinitized massive material mixed with either limpid or \n\npartly kaolinitized bipyramidal quartz, feldspar and muscovite crystals (Fig. 4H).  \n\nThe pelites (Fig. 5A,B), which increase in volume upward in the sections, consist of \n\nkaolinitized siltstones and mudstones that might be laminated forming heterolithic deposits. \n\nLarge, well-rounded areas up to 0.5 mm in diameter with same composition than the surrounding \n\ndeposits are locally present. Siltstones from the lower portion of the sections might display a high \n\nvolume of quartz grains that are mostly angular. They also display prismatic, bipyramidal \n\nkaolinitized grains (Fig. 5B). Pelites with brown kaolinites are particularly widespread in the \n\nuppermost portion of the soft kaolin, where many fractures filled either by iron or clear kaolinites \n\n(Fig. 5C). These fractured pelites grade into reworked deposits displaying rounded clasts of \n\nsimilar composition than the surrounding pelites (Fig. 5D).     \n\nThe above-described lithologies display three types of kaolinites, categorized according to \n\nsize and texture as Ka, Kb and Kc kaolinites. Ka kaolinite (Fig. 6A-C) consists of hexagonal to \n\npseudohexagonal crystals 10-30 \u00b5m in diameter that occur as agglomerates of booklets (Fig. 6A) \n\nor vermicular (Fig. 6B) shapes that reach up to 400 ?m in length. Either single or composite \n\nbooklets are present, the latter being formed by a set of laterally coalescing single booklets. \n\nEuhedral, elongated prismatic kaolinite crystals 1-3 \u00b5m in length growth out from the booklet \n\nsheets (Fig. 6C). Many Ka kaolinites display anomalous birefringence and grade into muscovite \n\ngrains. Kb kaolinite (Fig. 6D-G) consists of hexagonal and pseudohexagonal crystals averaging \n\n1-3 ?m in diameter (Fig. 6D) that occur isolated, as intergrowths of chaotic, face-to face (Fig. \n\n6E) or, less commonly, parallel to pseudo-parallel (Fig. 6F) crystals similar to the ones described \n\nby Pickering and Hurst (1989). This type of kaolinite occurs also arranged as booklets that are 5-\n\n10 \u00b5m in length. Lozenge kaolinite crystals intergrow with this type of kaolinite, and crudely \n\ndeveloped single rectangular booklets are common (Fig. 6G). Kb kaolinite is either distributed \n\nhomogeneously in the thin sections, or form masses containing agglomerates of Ka kaolinites \n\ndispersed within them. In addition, part of this kaolinite occurs in association with bipyramidal \n\ncrystal ghosts, as well as kaolinitized grains of the framework. Kc kaolinite (Fig. 6H) also \n\n 53\n\n\n\n 54\n\ndisplays hexagonal to pseudohexagonal forms, but the crystals have regular sizes around 200 nm \n\nin diameter.  \n\nAmongst all the kaolinite types described above, the sandstones bear the largest volume \n\nof Ka kaolinites, with Kb kaolinites being subordinate, and Kc kaolinites absent or, less \n\ncommonly, rare. Ka kaolinites often form aggregates of sand grain sizes. Part of this kaolinite is \n\nalso dispersed in the kaolinitized \u201cmatrix\u201d in association with Kb kaolinites. On the other hand, \n\nKc kaolinites occur consistently dispersed over the other two types of kaolinites. The pelites are \n\ndominated by Kb kaolinites, with Ka kaolinites being either rare or absent. Kc kaolinites are more \n\nfrequent in this lithology than in the sandstones. Its volume increases progressively upward, \n\nreaching a maximum in the fractured pelites with brown kaolinites that occur near the contact \n\nwith the discontinuity surface at the top of the soft kaolin.  \n\n \n\n 54\n\n\n\n 55\n\n100 m\u00b5100 m\u00b5\n\n100 m\u00b5\n\n100 m\u00b5100 m\u00b5 2 m\u00b5\n\n100 m\u00b5\n\nA B\n\nC D\n\nE F\n\nG H\n\n0.5 mm\n\n100 m\u00b5100 m\u00b5\n\nQz\n\nMu\n\n \nFigure 3.3 Kaolinitized quartzose sandstone, representative of the lower portion of the soft kaolin \nunit, illustrating: A) a broad view of the framework dominated by monocrystalline quartz grains; \nB,C) quartz grains with bipyramidal or cuneiform shapes, as well as vacuoles and embayments \nfilled by kaolinite; D) muscovite grain partly replaced by kaolinite; E,F) feldspar grain partly \nreplaced by kaolinite (note the albite twinning and prismatic shape); G) a lithic fragment (arrows) \ncomposed by muscovite, cuneiform quartz and a kaolinite, the latter resulting from replacement \nof other mineralogical constituents of the grain (note the that the quartz crystals-Qz are broadly \naligned parallel to the maximum elongation axis of the muscovite-Mu); H) ghosts of totally \nkaolinitized grains (arrows) with texture similar to the matrix.

As previously-mentioned, the latter, restricted to the intermediate unit, \n\nforms either slightly undulating or highly folded deposits. Kaolinitized, well rounded, moderately \n\nsorted, fine-grained to silty sandstones alternate with massive mudstones, defining laminations. \n\nThe intermediate unit is, in general, soft. It becomes harder only in its upper portion where \n\npaleosols are present, but even so, it is softer than the semi-flint kaolin. Its base displays Kb, and \n\nmore rarely Ka, kaolinites, both pervasively draped by Kc kaolinites (Fig. 7A). The volume of the \n\nlatter increases substantially upward (Fig. 7B).  \n\nThe intermediate kaolin is sharply overlain by massive, endured mudstones and \n\nsandstones of the semi-flint kaolin unit. The mudstones (Fig. 7C) are homogeneous and consist of \n\nyellowish-brown Kc kaolinite and, secondarily, Kb kaolinites, with the first increasing in volume \n\nupward. The mudstones from the top of the semi-flint unit might be entirely composed by Kc \n\nkaolinites. They also show numerous irregular fractures and fenestrae of variable sizes (Fig. 7C) \n\nthat are filled by clear kaolinites.  \n\nTwo types of sandstones occur in the intermediate and semi-flint units: quartz-sandstone \n\nand kaolinitized sandstone. Quartz-sandstones, which occur only in association with layers \n\nattributed to transgressive lags (Rossetti and Santos Jr. 2006), are very friable, contrasting with \n\nthe overall surrounding endured, kaolinitized deposits. These sandstones are moderately to well \n\nsorted, well rounded, and vary from fine to medium grain sizes. Kaolinitized sandstones are \n\nmostly moderately- to poorly-sorted, with very fine to medium grains sizes that are, in general, \n\nsub-rounded to rounded (Fig. 7D). The grains, which display punctual and, very rarely, concave-\n\nconvex contacts, consist of a homogeneous mass of dark brown kaolinite composed dominantly \n\nby Kc kaolinites (Fig. 7E), with only relicts of Kb kaolinites. Their boundaries are strongly \n\nhighlighted by coatings of iron oxide, present even between grains. The interstitial space was \n\ncompletely filled by cement of clear kaolinite. Samples displaying this characteristic revealed to \n\ncontain well-developed booklets of kaolinites (i.e., Ka kolinite), as well as iron oxides and \n\nhalloysite. The iron oxides form spheres or regular size (Fig. 7F), while the halloysite forms an \n\ninterlaced network of either tabular (Fig. 7G) or elongated, hairy (Fig. 7H) crystals. Nevertheless, \n\nthe SEM microscopic analysis also revealed that a great part of the interstitial space consists of \n\n 59\n\n\n\n 60\n\nKc kaolinites. Eventually, the framework grains might be fractured and filled by the clear \n\nkaolinite. \n\n  \n\n 60\n\n\n\n 61\n\n \n\n3 m\u00b5 5\u00b5m\n\n3 m\u00b5\n\nA B\n\nC D\n\nE F\n\nG H\n\n0.5mm\n\n15 m\u00b5\n\n1\u00b5m1\u00b5m\n\n100\u00b5m\n\n \nFigure 3.7 Endured mudstones and sandstones representative of the intermediate and semi-flint \nkaolin units.

Previous studies have proposed granitic and \n\nmetamorphic sources throughout the kaolin deposits of the Ipixuna Formation (Nascimento and \n\nG\u00f3es 2005). Truckenbrodt et al. (1991) and Kotschoubey et al. (1996, 1999) have proposed that \n\nthe kaolinite derives from replacement of feldspar grains and muddy matrix in arkosic deposits \n\nduring progressive deep weathering.  \n\nIn general, determining sandstone provenance is one of the most problematic issues in \n\nsedimentary geology. This is because one must consider the influence of various factors (e.g., \n\ntype of rock, relief, climate, tectonics, flow dynamics, depositional environment) acting in the \n\nsource area, as well as during sediment transportation, deposition and evolution after burial (Folk \n\n1974; Basu 1975; Young 1975) in order to discuss sediment sources.  In addition to all these \n\nfactors, the present location of the studied deposits in a tropical area further contributed to modify \n\ntheir primary characteristics due to weathering. Despite this high complexity, the detailed optical \n\n(i.e., petrographic and SEM) information presented herein, when analysed within a faciological \n\nand stratigraphic framework, contributes to further discuss the origin of the kaolinites in the Rio \n\nCapim area.  \n\n \n\n 62\n\n\n\n 63\n\n3.6.1 Composition and genesis of the soft kaolin unit \n  \n\nThe great thickness and the well stratified nature of the soft kaolin unit of the Ipixuna \n\nFormation have been used to propose an origin related to in situ alteration of feldspar grains from \n\narkosic deposits, as well as clay minerals from mudstones due to deep weathering (Kotschoubey \n\net al. 1996; 1999). Determining whether deep weathering or diagenesis was responsible for \n\nkaolinitization is an issue opened for debate. Optical observations concerning to the three \n\ncategories of kaolinites described herein confirm an origin related to kaolinitization of various \n\ntypes of material. The enhancement of Kc kaolinite towards the top unconformity is taken as a \n\ngood evidence of a genesis related to weathering and, possibly, soil formation. The presence of \n\nmany fractures filled by clear kaolinite is possibly related to the action of roots.  \n\nOn the other hand, the majority of the Kc kaolinite seems to have been formed by \n\nreplacement of Ka and Kb kaolinites, as suggested by: 1. its occurrence consistently over Ka and \n\nKb kaolinites; and 2. the inverse proportion in the volume of Kc kaolinites with respect to the \n\nother kaolinites.  \n\nThe increased abundance of Ka and Kb kaolinites in mudstones and sandstones, \n\nrespectively, is a good indication that the first resulted from replacement of sand grains, while the \n\nsecond is chiefly related to replacement of detrital clay minerals. These mineral transformations \n\npredate the formation of Kc kaolinites, suggesting that Ka and Kb kaolinites had an origin \n\nunrelated to weathering associated to the top unconformity, being most likely formed by contact \n\nwith intrastratal fluids during a previous burial.  \n\nThe quartzose sandstones display regular quartz grains derived either from granitic or \n\nmetamorphic rocks, or even both. The upward gradation from quartzose to kaolinitized \n\nsandstones attests to a change in sand composition. The almost complete disappearance of regular \n\nquartz grains upward in the soft kaolin unit is taken as further evidence to support diversified \n\nsediment source. The presence of monazite and topaz points to igneous contribution (Nascimento \n\nand G\u00f3es 2005). However, if only a granitic source would be considered, the volume of quartz \n\ngrains should have remained constant even if the grain size decreased (Tortosa et al. 1991). \n\nDespite the overall increase in the abundance of finer-grained sandstones upward in the soft \n\nkaolin unit, the fact that many intervals with kaolinitized sandstones are of same grain size as the \n\nquartzose sandstones led to suspect of a possible change in sediment source. The presence of \n\nheavy minerals such as kyanite and staurolite confirms a metamorphic contribution for these \n\n 63\n\n\n\n 64\n\nsediments (Nascimento and G\u00f3es 2005). The domain of monocrystalline, instead of \n\npolycrystalline, quartz grains are more typical of high degree of metamorphism (Yong 1975). On \n\nthe other hand, the abundance of bipyramidal quartz grains with straight extinction, embayments \n\nand vacuoles attests the presence of sediments derived from felsic volcanic rocks (e.g., Folk \n\n1974; Scholle 1979). Lithic fragments containing bipyramidal quartz crystals parallel to \n\nmuscovites suggest either an incipient foliation or primary bedding, leading to invoke a \n\ncontribution from either fine-grained volcaniclastics or volcanic rocks with a certain degree of \n\nmetamorphism.  \n\nThe prevalence of bipyramidal quartz, either as grains or crystals within lithic grains, \n\nconforms to a great influence of felsic volcanic fragments. The kaolinitized grains displaying \n\nbipyramidal or cuneiform shapes similar to quartz, but which have been replaced either entirely \n\nor partly by kaolinite, might record grains belonging to the silica group, but of a different species \n\nmore suitable for replacement. Ghosts of grains with bipyramidal shape led to suspect on the \n\npresence of cristobalite. As quartz, cristobalite is a mineral formed by sheets of tetrahedra \n\npointing alternately up and down, resulting in a bipyramidal shape. In addition, this mineral is \n\nusually found in association with volcanic rocks (e.g., Nesse 1991), thus being consistent with the \n\nproposed interpretation. Unfortunately, because only relicts of this mineral are preserved, its \n\noptical characterization was not enough to draw any further conclusions. The numerous black \n\ninclusions associated to these grains are taken as residues left behind during dissolution, followed \n\nby replacement by kaolinite, an interpretation consistent with the fact that this type of material is \n\nabsent in the kaolinitized matrix.  \n\nIf the foregoing interpretation is correct, then a great portion of the kaolinitized \n\nsandstones is formed by lithic grains of volcanic sources. In fact, it is possible that much of the \n\nbipyramidal quartz and cristobalite (?) of the sandstone framework are, in fact, crystals from \n\nlithic grains that were left behind during kaolinitization. This is suggested with basis on the \n\npresence of many areas of the kaolinitized \u201cmatrix\u201d with ghosts of grains with floating crystals \n\nwithin. Thus, part of the \u201cmatrix\u201d is in fact a pseudomatrix formed by replacement of the \n\nframework grains by kaolinite. Kaolinitization of the framework grains was pervasive, affecting \n\nnot only lithic grains, but also feldspar, muscovite and, less intensely, granitic and metamorphic \n\nquartz.  \n\n 64\n\n\n\n 65\n\nKaolinitization of framework grains produced large kaolinite crystals as agglomerates of \n\nbooklets, which form part of the Ka kaolinite. The crudely developed, large, rectangular booklets \n\nprobably record kaolinitized feldspar grains. This is suggested because this shape is similar to \n\nmany feldspar grains that are still preserved in the framework. Large kaolinite booklets resulted \n\nalso from replacement of muscovite, which is indicated by the fact that many large booklets with \n\nanomalous birefringence grade into muscovites. The presence of large kaolinite crystals \n\nassociated with both feldspar and muscovite grains are probably due to the larger volume of Al, \n\nas well as Si and O, available from alteration of these minerals. Lozenge kaolinite crystals \n\nintergrown with Ka booklets suggest a phase of kaolinite precipitation postdating the formation \n\nof booklets. \n\nDespite the fact that most of the Kb kaolinite resulted from kaolinitization of clay \n\nminerals from mudstones, as previously stated, this work shows that part of it was also derived \n\nfrom alteration of framework grains. This is revealed by the occurrence of this type of kaolinite in \n\nassociation with ghosts of quartz and cristobalite (?) grains and crystals from lithic fragments. In \n\nsummary, although the largest volume of Kb kaolinite resulted from replacement of mudstone \n\nlayers, a considerable amount of this kaolinite resulted from replacement of framework grains. In \n\nthis case, dissolution of SiO2 provided elements that combined with Al from circulating fluids in \n\norder to form Kc kaolinites. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.6.2 Composition and genesis of the semi flint kaolin unit \n \n\nHard, semi-flint kaolin deposits resembling the ones from the Rio Capim area have been \n\ndescribed in association with many other kaolin deposits worldwide. The origin of these endured \n\nkaolin overlying soft kaolin deposits has been a matter of great debate (e.g., Bates 1964; Hurst \n\nand Bosio 1975; Murray and Partridge 1982; Truckenbrodt et al. 1991; Murray and Keller 1993; \n\nYuan and Murray 1993; Chen et al. 1997; Kotschoubey et al. 1999; Montes et al. 2002). These \n\nauthors have often related the hard kaolin deposits to kaolinites with high degree of structural \n\ndisorder. The action of inorganic acids and microbes in soils and weathering crusts is known to \n\ncause the destruction of clays, with the consequent decrease of structural disorder (Hurst and \n\nPickering Jr. 1997; Hradil and Hostomsky 2002). Other workers have attributed the origin of the \n\n 65\n\n\n\n 66\n\nsemi-flint kaolin to clay flocculation in the presence of alkaline seawater (Kesller 1956; Schofield \n\nand Sampson 1954; Pickering and Hurst 1989; Dombrowski 1993). \n\nThe genesis of the semi-flint kaolin in the Rio Capim area has been interpreted to be \n\nclosely related to the underlying soft kaolin, with the hard kaolin recording the uppermost portion \n\nof progressive downward weathering (e.g., Sousa 2000). The origin of the semi flint kaolin has \n\nbeen also related to in situ precipitation of amorphous kaolinite by descending solutions under \n\ninfluence of organic acids, combined with the action of bacterias (Kotschoubey et al. 1996). In \n\nthe following, optical data are integrated with sedimentological and stratigraphic information \n\nrecently available in the literature in order to propose that the semi-flint and the soft kaolin units \n\nhad different depositional and evolutionary histories. In addition, it is stated that the Kc kaolinite, \n\nrather than representing in situ precipitation, resulted from multiple origins. \n\nIt is proposed herein that a significant volume of the Kc kaolinite in the semi flint kaolin \n\nunit was produced by pedogenesis. Likewise the soft kaolin unit, this is suggested by an overall \n\nincrease in the volume of Kc kaolinite relative to Ka and Kb kaolinites upward in the semi flint \n\nkaolin. As our unpublished work focusing on oxygen and hydrogen isotopes demonstrates that \n\nthe Kc kaolinite has values that contrast with modern soil waters, it is proposed that this type of \n\nkaolinite was most likely formed under influence of the paleosol developed in association with \n\nthe unconformity at the top of the Ipixuna Formation (Rossetti 2004). \n\nDespite the pedogenetic influence, it is possible that the Kc kaolinite from the semi flint \n\nkaolin unit had a more diversified origin. An important information to recall from previous work \n\nis the presence of an unconformity between the soft and the semi flint kaolin units, implying in \n\ndistinctive depositional sequences, as previously mentioned (Santos Jr. 2002; Rossetti and \n\nSantos Jr. 2003; Santos Jr. and Rossetti 2003). An ongoing study focusing on heavy minerals \n\ncomparing these units attests to mineralogical assemblages having different textural \n\ncharacteristics. Hence, there is an abrupt increase in grain roundness when crossing the basal \n\nunconformity, which led to suspect that part of the semi-flint kaolin might have been formed by \n\nreworking of the underlying soft kaolin. \n\nA large volume of kaolinitized, mud-supported breccias and conglomerates has been \n\nreported in these deposits, which is consistent with intense sediment reworking (e.g., \n\nKotschoubey et al. 1996; Santos and Rossetti 2003; Rossetti and Santos Jr. 2006). In addition, \n\naccording to the latter authors, an important part of the semi-flint kaolin encompasses deposits \n\n 66\n\n\n\n 67\n\nrepresentative of mouth bar deposits, requesting a primary sandy composition. This study \n\nrevealed that even the muddier hard kaolin is, at least in great part, composed by sand grain sizes, \n\nand not muds as originally thought. The well to moderate grain roundness, as well as the iron-\n\noxide coatings predating mechanical compaction, as suggested by their presence even where \n\ngrains are in contact, conform to deposition of this kaolin as sands. It is suspected that the sands \n\nmight have been produced by reworking of the underlying soft kaolin unit. Together with the \n\nheavy mineral assemblage, this is suggested because, as opposed to the underlying kaolinitized \n\nsandstones from the soft kaolin unit, these sandstones are formed by grains consisting exclusively \n\nof completely homogeneous masses of dark brown Kc kaolinites. \n\nAs the uppermost part of the soft kaolin was exposed to weathering during development \n\nof a sequence boundary between the soft and the semi flint kaolin units (Rossetti, 2004), the \n\nformation of Kc kaolinites, represented by interlocking of crystals&lt;200 nm in diameter, was \n\nfavored. Reworking of this material in a new depositional setting (in this instance, deltaic mouth \n\nbars) might have resulted in sandstones composed by rounded grains of kaolin already displaying \n\na certain degree of hardness promoted by the prevalence of Kc kaolinites.  \n\nThe presence of distinctive clear Kc kaolinite filling up the interstitial spaces of the \n\nsandstones, as well as the fractures, indicates that the semi flint kaolin was further endured due to \n\ncementation. The fact that the SEM analysis revealed halloysite and Ka kaolinites in samples \n\ndisplaying clear kaolinite led to argue that this cement is actually represented by a mixture of \n\nthese minerals. In particular, it has been claimed that the presence of halloysite might contribute \n\nto increase significantly the hardness of kaolin deposits due to the intricate crystals intergrowth \n\n(e.g., Grant 1963; Bates 1964; Osborne et al. 1994). In this instance, the volume of halloysite is \n\nprobably low, but they occur only in the semi-flint kaolin. The occurrence of this mineral as \n\ncement in kaolin deposits is usually related to pedogenesis (e.g., Keller 1977, 1982). Halloysite \n\nprecipitating together with Ka and Kc kaolinites in the interstitial porosity probably have \n\ncontributed to endure the semi-flint kaolin unit. \n\nIn addition of a derivation from the underlying soft kaolin unit, the sediments that gave \n\nrise to the semi-flint had a contribution directly from metamorphic rocks. This is suggested also \n\nby an ongoing study that reveals the presence of euhedral staurolite and kyanite, as well as the \n\noccurrence of hornblende, with no evidence of dissolution, characteristics not present in the \n\nunderlying soft kaolin unit. Furthermore, a sedimentary source is proposed for the quartz \n\n 67\n\n\n\n 68\n\nsandstones, which were related to intense reworking associated with marine flooding surfaces \n\n(Rossetti &amp; Santos Jr. 2006).    \n\n \n\n \n\n3.7 FINAL REMARKS \n\n \n\nThe present optical study allows is consistent with the attribution of the soft and the semi-\n\nflint kaolin units to distinctive depositional sequences. In addition to the unconformity mapped \n\nbetween these sequences, the recognition of different sediment sources is consistent with such an \n\ninterpretation. Furthermore, the kaolinite from these deposits had distinctive origins, as great part \n\nof the soft kaolin represents kaolinitization of framework grains of sandstones and replacement of \n\nother clay minerals from mudstones. Kaolinitization was intense enough to modify most of the \n\nprimary composition. However, detailed optical studies revealed many relicts of the original \n\ntexture, suggesting that the kaolinitized sandstones were formed by lithic grains of felsic \n\nvolcanic, as well as volcaniclastics or meta-volcanic rocks. Diagenesis of these sandstones \n\npromoted significant compositional changes, with strong kaolinitization of the framework grains. \n\nLithic grains, as well as grains having a probable cristobalite composition, were more suitable for \n\nreplacement than quartz grains. The kaolinitization process contributed to produce a deposit with \n\na large volume of pseudomatrix, which gave them the actual wacky composition. The abundance \n\nof relicts and ghosts of grains, as well as enlarged areas between grains that appear to float in the \n\nmatrix, however, led to the conclusion that these are artificial wackes produced during \n\nkaolinitization.  \n\nThe upward almost disappearance of regular quartz grains in the soft kaolin unit is \n\nexplained by a change in both sedimentary conditions and sediment sources. This situation might \n\nhave been favored by the estuarine nature of the depositional setting (Rossetti and Santos Jr. \n\n2003; Santos Jr. and Rossetti 2003). Hence, the quartzose sandstones from the base of the \n\nsections might record higher energy flows associated to the initial transgression of the estuarine \n\nsystem. During this process, unstable grains have higher potential to be lost due to the strong \n\nreworking by tidal currents and waves, which favors deposition of sands rich in quartz grains at \n\nthe estuary axis. As the estuary is filled with sediment, there is a greater interaction of marine and \n\nfluvial flows, with the latter dominating in inner estuarine areas. The deposits located in the \n\n 68\n\n\n\n 69\n\nmiddle and upper portions of the studied sections formed in a variety of tidal depositional settings \n\ntypical of inner and middle estuarine areas. The sediment in these settings derived mainly from \n\nfluvial inflows, resulting in sandstones with composition of the framework grains that varied with \n\nrelation to the quartzose sandstones. Diagenesis of these deposits led to an intense kaolinitization, \n\nbut with preservation of primary structures. Burial promoted the replacement of sandstones and \n\nmudstones by Ka and Kb kaolinites. Kc kaolinites formed later on by replacement of Ka and Kb \n\nkaolinites in association with pedogenesis related to the development of the unconformity that \n\nbounds the top of the soft kaolin unit.  \n\nThe semi flint kaolin, on the other hand, resulted from sediments reworked from the \n\nunderlying soft kaolin deposits, which were mixed with an additional nearby metamorphic \n\nsource. This would have brought Kc kaolinites from the upper, slightly endured portion of the \n\nsoft kaolin. The reworked sediment would have been reduced to sand grain sizes, adopting a dirt \n\nappearance during transportation, and becoming coated by iron oxide. Weathering acting during \n\ntransportation contributed to further endure the kaolin grains. Following deposition, additional Kc \n\nkaolinite was formed throughout the semi flint kaolin due to pedogenetic processes associated to \n\nthe unconformity that marks the top of the Ipixuna Formation. Further Kc kaolinite was \n\nintroduced by cementation of sandstones and filling of fractures.  \n\nDespite the sharp boundaries and the softer nature, the intermediate unit displays \n\nsedimentological features with more affinity to the semi-flint kaolin than to the soft kaolin unit. \n\nThe intermediate and the semi-flint kaolin units also have comparable heavy mineral \n\ncharacteristics, as well as prevalence of Kc kaolinites. The data presented herein, however, was \n\nnot enough to decide if the intermediate kaolin is the remaining of a distinctive depositional unit \n\nor part of the semi-flint kaolin unit, as previously pointed out (Rossetti, 2004).  \n\n \n\n 69\n\n\n\n 70\n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\nAZEVEDO, R.P. 1991.

ORIGIN OF THE RIO CAPIM KAOLINITES (NORTHERN BRAZIL) \n\nREVEALED BY ?18O AND ?D ISOTOPE ANALYSIS \n \n\nAnt\u00f4nio Em\u00eddio de Ara\u00fajo SANTOS  Jr, \nDilce de F\u00e1tima ROSSETTI \n\nand Haydn H. MURRAY \n \n4.1 ABSTRACT \n\n \n\nDeuterium (?D) and oxygen (?18O) isotope data from the Rio Capim kaolin, northern \n\nBrazil, were combined with optical studies in order to better understand the genesis and evolution \n\nof the kaolinites. The results show that ?18O isotope values from a lower soft kaolin unit range \n\nfrom 6.04\u2030 to 19.18\u2030 for Ka (size ranging from 1 to 3 \u00b5m) and Kb (size ranging from 10 to 30 \n\n\u00b5m) kaolinites, and from 15.38\u2030 to 24.86\u2030 for Kc (size&lt;200 nm) kaolinites. The ?D values \n\nrange from \u201363.06\u2030 to 79.46\u2030 for the Ka+Kb kaolinites, and from \u201368.85\u2030 to \u2013244.35\u2030 for \n\nthe Kc kaolinites. An upper semi flint kaolin unit, dominated by Kc kaolinites, displays ?18O and \n\n?D isotope values ranging from 15.08\u2030 to 21.77\u2030, and -71.31\u2030 to -87.37\u2030, respectively. \n\nBased on these data, and on the ?18O and ?D values obtained for the surface meteoric water and \n\ngroundwater, it can be concluded that the kaolinites are not in equilibrium with the modern \n\nweathering environment, but they reflect isotopic compositions of the formation time, probably \n\ndue to the interaction with groundwaters. However, mineralogical contaminations derived from \n\nreplacements of framework grains also had great influence in the isotopic composition of these \n\nkaolinites. In addition, the isotope values of the Kc kaolinites from the semi-flint kaolin unit is \n\nvariable, which is due to the presence of Kc kaolinites of different origins, including kaolinites \n\nderived from the underlying soft kaolin unit, kaolinites formed during different phases of \n\npaleoweathering, as well as later phases of coarse-grained kaolinites formed along fractures. Due \n\nto these complexities, binary diagrams contrasting ?18O and ?D isotope values, worldwide \n\napplied for distinguishing supergenic from hypogenic kaolinites, as well as those formed under \n\nweathering conditions, can not be applied to interpret the origin of the kaolinites in the Rio \n\nCapim Kaolin.  \n\n \n\nKeywords ?18O and ?D, optical studies, Rio Capim kaolin, kaolinite, origin, genesis. \n\n 76\n\n\n\n 77\n\n4.2 INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nHydrogen and oxygen isotopes have been increasingly applied to approach the \n\nenvironmental conditions prevailing during formation of clay minerals (Savin and Epstein, \n\n1970a,b; Lawrence and Taylor, 1971,1972; Savin and Lee, 1988; Zhou and Dobos, 1994; Mizota \n\nand Longstaffe, 1996; Savin and Hsieh, 1997; Stern et al., 1997; Gilg, 2000; Vitali et al., 2002; \n\nGilg et al., 2003; Tabor and Montanez, 2005). In pedogenic minerals from weathered deposits, \n\nthese isotopes are in equilibrium with meteoric waters (Savin and Epstein, 1970a; Lawrence and \n\nTaylor, 1971,1972; Mizota and Longstaffe, 1996; Savin and Hsieh, 1997; Girard et al., 2000), \n\nwhile their interaction with pore-waters and circulating hydrothermal waters takes place in burial \n\nand hydrothermal environments, respectively (Sheppard et al., 1969; Marumo et al., 1980; Sun \n\nand Eadington, 1987; Cruz and Reyes, 1998; Boulvais et al., 2000). ?D and ?18O from kaolinites \n\nin weathering profiles allow establishing a straight linear equation, traditionally known as the \n\nkaolinite line, as well as estimating the isotope fractionation factor (?) (Savin and Epstein, \n\n1970a). Likewise, a supergene/hypogene line (S/H) has been used to separate clay minerals \n\nformed under earth surface and high burial temperatures, respectively (Sherppard et al., 1969). In \n\naddition to kaolinite (Savin and Epstein, 1970a, Liu and Epstein, 1984; Savin and Lee, 1988; \n\nZhou and Dobos, 1994; Gilg and Sheppard, 1996; Cruz and Reyes, 1998; Boulvais et al., 2000; \n\nGilg, 2000; Girard et al., 2000; Gilg et al., 2003), montmorillonite, glauconite, illite and many \n\nother minerals have been applied in these investigations (Savin and Epstein, 1970a; James and \n\nBaker, 1976; Savin and Lee, 1988). Furthermore, the isotope composition of surface and near-\n\nsurface modern waters (Bowen and Wilkinson, 2002; Fricke and O\u2019Neil, 1999; Bowen and \n\nRevenaugh, 2003) relative to SMOW (Standard Mean Ocean Water) has been used to define the \n\nMeteoric Water Line (Freidman, 1953; Craig, 1961; Epstein et al., 1965). All these concepts have \n\nbeen applied to discuss the environmental conditions during the deposition and post-deposition \n\ntime of clayey deposits, particularly regarding to paleotemperature (Savin and Lee, 1988; Yapp, \n\n1986; Gilg and Sheppard, 1996). \n\nAlthough experiments with stable isotopes support a relationship between ?D and ?18O \n\nobtained from clay minerals and paleotemperature, this approach is not so straightforward, as \n\nother factors must be taking into account, including latitude, altitude, and distance from the \n\ncoastline (Savin, 1977; Savin and Hsieh, 1998). Due to these complexities, further studies \n\n 77\n\n\n\n 78\n\nemphasizing ?D and ?18O isotopes must be undertaken to provide a full comprehension of the \n\nbehavior of these values along ancient clayey deposits, particularly considering a larger volume \n\nof analogs that can be used as a basis for comparisons.  \n\nThe Ipixuna Formation exposed in the Rio Capim area, northern Brazil, is well known for \n\nits kaolin reserves, one of the largest in the world. Due to the economic interest, this unit has been \n\nincreasingly under investigation, with many publications presented in the last years concerning to \n\naspects including the depositional environment, provenance, petrography and geochemistry \n\n(G\u00f3es, 1981; Truckenbrodt et al., 1991; Kotschoubey et al., 1996; 1999; Costa and Moraes, 1998; \n\nRossetti and Santos Jr., 2003, 2006; Rossetti, 2004; Sousa, 2000; Santos Jr., 2002; Santos Jr. and \n\nRossetti, 2003, 2006; Nascimento and Goes, 2005). As a result of these studies, the Ipixuna \n\nFormation has been subdivided into two stratigraphic units, consisting of a lower soft kaolin unit, \n\nand an upper semi flint kaolin unit, bounded by discontinuity surfaces associated with lateritic \n\npaleosols. Despite the presence of these weathering surfaces, optical studies have indicated \n\ndifferent types of kaolinite in the Ipixuna Formation, with a large volume appearing to be \n\nunrelated to surface processes. The occurrence of these weathering surfaces, combined with the \n\nfact that kaolinite is the major constituent in the Ipixuna Formation, favors the application of ?D \n\nand ?18O isotope in order to distinguish the various kaolinite generations present in these \n\ndeposits. In addition to help better understand the genesis and evolution of the kaolinites from the \n\nRio Capim area, this study attempts to contribute testing the applicability of these methods for \n\nreconstructing the environmental conditions involved in the kaolinite formation. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3 GEOLOGY \n\n \n\nThe Ipixuna Formation encompasses Upper Cretaceous-?Lower Tertiary kaolinitized \n\nsandstones and mudstones that are well exposed in the eastern Camet\u00e1 Sub-Basin, where the Rio \n\nCapim Kaolin focused herein is located. The genesis of this basin, situated in the Maraj\u00f3 Graben \n\nSystem, is linked to the strike-slip deformation that took place along the Equatorial Brazilian \n\nMargin during the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean (Azevedo, 1991; Galv\u00e3o, 1991; Villegas, \n\n1994; Costa et al., 2001). The Camet\u00e1 Sub-Basin displays mostly fluvial to shallow marine \n\ndeposits recorded by a sedimentary pile up to 10 km thick comprising the Breves (Aptian-\n\n 78\n\n\n\n 79\n\nCenomanian), Limoeiro (Late Cretaceous), Maraj\u00f3 (Paleocene-Eocene) and Tucunar\u00e9 \n\n(Pleistocene) formations (Fig. 1). \n\nThe Ipixuna Formation exposed in the Rio Capim area reaches up to 40 m thick. The \n\nlower soft kaolin unit records an overall fining- and thinning-upward succession up to 20 m thick, \n\ncharacterized from bottom to top by tidally influenced fluvial channel, tidal channel, tidal \n\nflat/mangrove, and tidal sand bar/tidal sandy flat, attributed to an estuarine system (Santos Jr., \n\n2002; Santos Jr. and Rossetti, 2006). Tidally influenced fluvial and tidal channels are defined by \n\nsharply based, locally concave up, fining- and thinning-upward successions formed by tabular to \n\ntrough cross-stratified or laminated sandstones, as well as intraformational conglomerates and \n\nheterolithic mudstones/sandstones. Tidal channel deposits are distinguished from tidally \n\ninfluenced fluvial channels based on the abundance of both reactivation surfaces and mud drapes \n\nalong cross sets, and trace fossils  including Thalassinoides, Planolites, Teichichnus, Taenidium \n\nand Skolithos. Tidal flat/mangrove records the finest deposits of the soft kaolin unit, consisting of \n\ntabular packages of highly bioturbated (mostly Skolithos and Ophiomorpha), heterolithic-bedded \n\nsandstones and mudstones. Tidal sand bars and tidal sandy flats, which contain Thalassinoides, \n\nOphiomorpha, Skolithos, and Planolites, form laterally continuous, either lenticular or tabular \n\npackages bounded at the base by either planar or only slightly undulating (though not erosive) \n\nsurfaces, which internally display horizontally stratified sandstones with abundant parting \n\nlineation that are interbeded with heterolithic deposits. As a result of these facies characterization, \n\nthe traditional attribution to a fluvial-lacustrine depositional setting to the soft kaolin unit (G\u00f3es, \n\n1981) has been reconsidered in favor of an estuarine system (Rossetti and Santos Jr., 2003, 2006; \n\nRossetti, 2004; Santos Jr., 2002; Santos Jr. and Rossetti, 2003, 2006). \n\nThe upper semi-flint kaolin unit is either massive or incipiently structured, comprising \n\nsandstone, mudstone, intraformational conglomerate and heterolithic deposits attributed, at least \n\nin part, to distributary channel and mouth bar depositional environments associated to either a \n\ndeltaic or wave-dominated estuarine setting (Rossetti and Santos Jr. 2006). The distributary \n\nchannels are characterized by concave up kaolinitized sandstones and mudstones displaying a \n\nbasal lag of quartz sandstones. These deposits intergrade with strata displaying a series of \n\ninclined lines, defining lobed bodies that are locally highlighted by distinctively soft, massive \n\nmud layers. \n\n \n\n 79\n\n\n\n 80\n\n \n\n3\u00b0\n\n2\u00b0\n\n1\u00b0\n\n0\u00b0\n\n1\u00b0N\n48\u00b050\u00b0 46\u00b0W\n\n4\u00b0100km\n\nIpixuna\n\nParagominas\n\nIRCC\n\nPPSA\n\nBR-316\n\nTectonic\nLineament\nRoad\n\nSBM\n\nSBL\n\nSBM\n\nSBC\n\nBel\u00e9m\n\nCap\nim R\n\niver\n\nB\nR\n\n-0\n10\n\nMaraj\u00f3 Graben System\n\n? ?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\nE\nar\n\nly\nL\n\nat\ne\n\nC\nR\n\nE\nTA\n\nC\nE\n\nO\nU\n\nS\n\nAge\n\nLithostratigraphy\n\nSubsurface\n\n   Breves\nFormation\n\n  Limoeiro\nFormation\n\n  Maraj\u00f3 Formation\n\n Tucunar\u00e9 Formation\n\n    Ipixuna\n Formation\n\n Pirabas/Barreiras \n      Formation\n\n P\u00f3s-Barreiras Sediments\n\nUnamed Cretaceous\n          deposits\n\n   \n It\n\nap\nec\n\nur\nu \n\nG\nro\n\nup\n\nStudy area\n\n?\n\nA)\n\nB)\n\nQ\nU\n\nA\nT\n\nE\nR\n\nN\nA\n\nR\nY\n\nT\nE\n\nR\nT\n\nIA\nR\n\nY\n\nM araj\u00f3\nIsland\n\nS\u00e3o Lu\u00eds-Graja\u00fa\nBasin\n\nPar\u00e1 Platform\n\nBragantina \nPlatform\n\n \nFigure 4.1 A) Location of the study area in the eastern Camet\u00e1 Sub-Basin, Maraj\u00f3 Graben \nSystem, with indication of the two studied quarries, the IRCC and PPSA (SBC=Camet\u00e1 Sub-\nBasin, SBL=Limoeiro Sub-Basin, SBM=Mexiana Sub-Basin). B) Lithostratigraphic chart of the \nCamet\u00e1 Sub-Basin. \n\n 80\n\n\n\n 81\n\nOur ongoing studies reveal that the soft kaolin unit described above displays three types \n\nof kaolinite, categorized according to size and texture, as Ka, Kb and Kc kaolinites. Ka kaolinite, \n\ntypical of the sandstones, consists of hexagonal to pseudohexagonal crystals 10-30 \u00b5m in \n\ndiameter, and occurs as agglomerates of booklets or vermicular crystals that reach up to 400 \u00b5m \n\nin length. Kb kaolinite, which dominates in the mudstones, consists chiefly of hexagonal and \n\npseudohexagonal crystals averaging 1-3 \u00b5m in diameter. Both kaolinites might entirely or partly \n\nreplace grains of the framework, including quartz, feldspar, muscovite, as well as igneous (mostly \n\nvolcanic) and metamorphic lithics. Kc kaolinite displays hexagonal to pseudohexagonal crystals \n\nwith regular sizes around 200 nm in diameter (Fig. 2).  \n\nThe soft kaolin consists mostly of Ka and Kb kaolinites, with the first dominating in the \n\nsandstones and the latter in the mudstones. In addition, Kc kaolinite occurs subordinately, always \n\nmantling the other kaolinite types, which suggests its formation, at least in part, from the coarser-\n\ngrained kaolinites. Kc kaolinite increases significantly in abundance upward in the soft kaolin \n\nunit, where it is associated with a paleosol horizon linked to the unconformity that separates the \n\nsoft and the semi-flint kaolin units. As opposed to the soft kaolin unit, the semi-flint is dominated \n\nby endured Kc kaolinite, though the other types of kaolinite might also occur at the base of the \n\nunit, as well as associated with fractures abundant in its top.  \n\n 81\n\n\n\n 82\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nA\n\n1 m\u00b5\n\nKa\nKb Kc\n\n1 m\u00b5\n\n1 m\u00b5\n\nB\n\n5 m\u00b5\n\nDC\n\n \nFigure 4.2 Types of kaolinites from the Rio Capim area.

(1982), respectively. The samples were obtained \n\nfrom representative profiles along two quarries (i.e., IRCC and PPSA) of the Rio Capim area, \n\nlocated circa 60 km apart, and aimed to record different lithofacies, including kaolinitized \n\nsandstones, pelites and conglomerates from the two kaolin units described above.  \n\nPreliminarily, three parcels were obtained from selected samples in order to record the \n\nthree types of kaolinites (i.e., Ka, Kb, and Kc) observed by optical studies. Each kaolin sample \n\nwas first dispersed in a solution containing distilled water and sodium hexametaphosphate. The \n\nsamples were then carefully disaggregated ultrasonically for 10 seconds and, subsequently, \n\nsieved to separate the fractions >64 \u00b5m, from which kaolinite booklets (Ka kaolinite) were hand \n\npicked under a binocular. The grain sizes&lt;64 \u00b5m were separated through settling according to \n\nStokes\u2019 Law to obtain the fractions&lt;200 nm, 1 to 3 \u00b5m, and 10 to 30 \u00b5m, recording the Kc, Kb \n\nand Ka kaolinites. The latter was added to the booklets hand picked from the&lt;64 \u00b5m. Each \n\nfraction was purified using distilled water at least three times and concentrated by centrifugation. \n\nThey were then heated at 100\u00b0C in a vacuum chamber oven for 24 hours in order to remove \n\nadsorbed water between octahedric and tetrahedrical sheets.  \n\nFor ?18O isotope extraction, 5 mg of each parcel were put in a copper tube and heated at \n\n100\u00b0C under high vacuum for 1 hour. Following this procedure, bromine pentafluoride (BrF5) \n\nwas introduced to release the oxygen that was reacted with a graphite disk in an intensive light to \n\nproduce CO2. The CO2 was trapped in a glass tube using liquid N2. To obtain the ?18O data, the \n\nsamples were analyzed on a Finingan-MAT DELTA mass spectrometer. For ?D isotope analysis, \n\n1 mg of kaolinite from each parcel was inserted in a vacuum system containing He and extracted \n\non-line directly from Thermo-Finnigan TCEA (thermal conversion elemental analyzer), operated \n\nat 1,440\u00b0C. Kaolinite (KGA), and serpentine plus kaolinite (KGA) standards were routinely \n\nmeasured together with the kaolinite samples to verify the accuracy of the ?18O and ?D data. ?18O \n\nand ?D values are reported in parts permil (\u2030) relative to Standard Mean Ocean Water (SMOW). \n\nAll ?18O and ?D data were analyzed from Geological Laboratory of the Indiana University, EUA. \n\n 83\n\n\n\n 84\n\nThe preliminary tests revealed that the Ka e Kb kaolinites displayed similar ?18O and ?D \n\nisotope values (Tab. 1), and for this reason the fractions >1\u00b5m were systematically analyzed as \n\none single parcel to include the Ka and Kb kaolinites. \n\n?18O and ?D data were also obtained from rainfall and groundwater samples collected \n\nduring the raining season on May 2005. Four samples were collected, two from meteoric water at \n\nthe surface and two from groundwater at depths of 60 m (IRCC quarry) and 150 m (PPSA \n\nquarry). The isotope values were measured using a Thermo Finnigan Delta Plus XP isotope ratio \n\nmass spectrometer. For the hydrogen extraction, a HDevice inlet was applied to reduce 0.7 uL of \n\nwater on hot chromium at 850\u00b0C for 60 seconds. For the oxygen extraction, a Gas Bench was \n\nused at 34\u00b0C for 12 hours aiming CO -H O equilibration. For both isotopes, the samples were \n\ncompared to two internal laboratory standards (Boulder Water and Miami Water) with distinct \n\nisotopic compositions in order to calibrate the machine slope. The two internal laboratory \n\nstandards were calibrated using international standards (VSMOW). \n\n2 2\n\n \n\n4.4.1 ?18O and ?D isotope data \n \n\nThe ?18O and ?D values obtained for the soft and semi-flint kaolin units, as well as for the \n\nlocal surface meteoric and groundwater, are illustrated in Table 1 and plotted in Figures 4.3 to \n\n4.5.   \n\nIn general, ?18O and ?D values obtained for the soft kaolin samples from both quarries display \n\nsimilar patterns of variation. Hence, the Ka+Kb kaolinites have ?18O values ranging from 6.04\u2030 \n\nto 18.83\u2030, with an average of 14.83\u2030, and from 12.79\u2030 to 19.18\u2030, with an average of \n\n16.47\u2030, in the PPSA and IRCC quarries, respectively. For the Kc kaolinites, these values range \n\nfrom 15.38\u2030 to 24.86\u2030, with an average of 19.67\u2030, and 16.42\u2030 to 23.32\u2030, with an average \n\nof 19.29\u2030 for the PPSA and IRCC quarries, respectively. The ?D values for the Ka+Kb \n\nkaolinites of the PPSA quarry range from \u201363.99\u2030 to -73.87\u2030, with an average of \u201368.35\u2030, \n\ndisregarding sample E14. These kaolinites in the IRCC quarry revealed values ranging from \u2013\n\n63.06\u2030 to \u201379.46\u2030, with an average of \u201370.10\u2030, disregarding sample E-126, which shows an \n\nanomalous value of \u201342.56\u2030. For the Kc kaolinite, the ?D values vary from \u201374.42\u2030 to \u2013\n\n221.64\u2030, with an average of \u2013100.02\u2030, and from \u201368.85\u2030 to \u2013244.35\u2030, with an average of \u2013\n\n114.21\u2030 for the PPSA and IRCC, respectively. Despite these overall variable results, it is \n\n 84\n\n\n\n 85\n\nnoteworthy that the Kc kaolinite from samples located at the paleosol horizon in the PPSA quarry \n\n(see E18-E21) displays ?D isotope values that are very uniform, between \u201376.13\u2030 and \u201379.42\u2030. \n\nIt is noteworthy that the ?18O curve of the Kc kaolinite in the soft kaolin unit shows the same \n\npattern of variation when compared to the values obtained in stratigraphic equivalent Ka+Kb \n\nkaolinites. \n\nThe Kc kaolinite from the semi-flint kaolin unit displays ?18O and ?D isotope values that \n\nare comparably less variable than in the soft kaolin unit. Hence, ?18O values range from 18.21\u2030 \n\nto 19.88\u2030, with an average of 18.56\u2030, and from 15.08\u2030 to 21.77\u2030, with an average of \n\n17.47\u2030 in the PPSA and IRCC quarries, respectively.  The ?D varies from -75.38\u2030 to -87.37\u2030, \n\nwith an average of -80.86\u2030, and -71.31\u2030 to -90.10\u2030, with an average of -78.29\u2030 in the PPSA \n\nand IRCC quarries, respectively. \n\nThe present-day meteoric water indicates ?18O and ?D values of \u20131.3\u2030 and \u20130.3\u2030, and \u2013\n\n4.1\u2030 and \u20131.1\u2030 in the PPSA and IRCC quarries, respectively. These values for the groundwater \n\ncollected in the Ipixuna Formation at a depth of 60, indicate \u20134.9\u2030 for the oxygen and \u201322.5\u2030 \n\nfor the hydrogen (Fig. 5).   \n\n 85\n\n\n\n 86\n\n \nPPSA Quarry IRCC Quarry \n\n  ?Dkao  ?\n18Okao ?Dkao\n\n \n\nSamples  kc ka+kb kc \n\n \n\nSamples ka+kb kc ka+kb kc \nE1 6.04+ 18.64 -68.13 -79.06 E124 12.91 17.17 -67.38 -68.85-\n\nE2 11.79 18.38 -65.35 -74.42- E95 14.16 19.09 -63.06- -90.39 \nE3 18.83+ 19.28 -70.27 -83.01 E96 14.89 19.91 -65.22 -101.79 \nE4 16.02 22.90 -68.53 -193.44 E97 18.19 18.32 -72.53 -107.32 \nE5 17.64 18.11 -64.57 -119.19 E98 16.17 19.43 -66.38 -79.56 \nE6 11.39 15.63 -68.14 -113.01 E99 13.14 17.09 -72.79 -162.41 \nE7 11.17 19.83 -68.85 -115.76 E100 14.77 20.20 -69.84 -77.59 \nE8 16.61 18.77 -67.67 -95.71 E101 15.54 17.08 -69.13 -147.61 \nE9 16.90 18.84 -66.05 -107.48 E102 17.79 23.32+ -72.67 -201.60 \nE10 11.79 16.45 -67.16 -111.10 E103 12.79- 21.54 -69.94 -176.93 \nE11 13.87 17.28 -68.49 -91.47 E104 18.38 22.71 -67.80 -199.96 \nE12 17.82 22.06 -65.88 -132.68 E105 18.01 19.21 -71.64 -74.03 \nE13 18.35 22.07 -69.86 -141.39 E106 17.11 19.07 -71.57 -79.03 \nE14 16.88 22.38 -80.68# -189.10 E107 17.70 18.92 -67.48 -126.21 \nE15 14.57 24.86+ -67.85 -140.08 E108 18.57 19.57 -66.39 -115.78 \nE16 17.29 19.96 -63.99- -221.64+ E109 17.73 18.18 -67.32 -244.35+\n\nE17 15.87 22.46 -69.85 -127.03 E110 14.87 16.97 -67.47 -111.10 \nE18 12.25 15.38- -72.76 -79.42 E111 16.91 18.01 -67.40 -105.45 \nE19 15.12 17.09 -71.42 -76.13 E112 16.55 18.49 -68.77 -70.24 \nE21 16.44 23.11 -73.87+ -76.13 E113 16.16 17.86 -70.35 -116.03 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nA \n \n\nAverage  14.83 19.67 -68.35 -100.02 FI206 19.18+ 19.98 -69.64 -71.48 \nE22  18.03  -81.05 E114 16.90 22.40 -65.87 -104.82 \nE88  19.88+  -75.72 E115 17.17 20.71 -73.04 -95.71 \nE24  18.24  -84.78 E125 15.31 16.42- -77.92 -92.27 \nE26  18.43  -87.37+ E126 18.90 21.04 -42.56# -95.55 \nE28  18.21-  -75.38- E116 17.05 19.70 -79.46+ -76.54 \n\n     E117 16.46 18.06 -76.49 -85.58 \n     E127 17.97 19.69 -75.02 -111.83 \n     \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nA \n\nAverage 16.47 19.29 -70.10 -114.21 \n     E118  17.99  -75.44 \n     FI217  21.77+  -81.57 \n     FI218  18.56  -71.35 \n     E119  15.90  -80.76 \n     FI219  18.43  -71.31-\n\n     E120C  16.18  -82.98 \n     E121  15.08-  -73.69 \n     E122  17.31  -77.39 \n     FI210  15.98  -90.10+\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nB \n \n\nAverage   18.56  -80.86 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\nB \n \n \n\nAverage  17.47  -78.29 \nTable 1 ?D and ?18O isotope values of the kaolinites from the study area (A=soft kaolin unit; \nB=semi-flint kaolin unit; Ka=Ka kaolinite; Kb=Kb kaolinite; Kc=Kc kaolinite. \n\n 86\n\n\n\n 87\n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.3 Lithostratigraphic profiles of the PPSA quarry, with the corresponding ?D and ?18O \nisotope values. \n\n 87\n\n\n\n 88\n\n \n\n \n \nFigure 4.4 Lithostratigraphic profiles of the IRCC quarry, with the corresponding ?D and ?18O \nisotope values (See figure 3 for legend). \n\n 88\n\n\n\n 89\n\n \n\n?\n \n\nD\n(\n\n)\n\u2030\n\n? ? 18 ( )\u2030\n\n-250.00\n\n-200.00\n\n-150.00\n\n-100.00\n\n-50.00\n\n0.00\n\n-10 -5 0 5 10 15 20 25\n\n-250.00\n\n-200.00\n\n-150.00\n\n-100.00\n\n-50.00\n\n0.00\n\n-10 -5 0 5 10 15 20 25\n\nMe\nteo\n\nric \nWa\n\nter \nLin\n\ne\n\nMe\nteo\n\nric \nWa\n\nter \nLin\n\ne\n\nSup\nerg\n\nene\n-Hy\n\npog\nene\n\n Lin\ne\n\nKao\nlini\n\nte L\nine\n\nSup\nerg\n\nene\n-Hy\n\npog\nene\n\n Li\nne\n\nKa\nolin\n\nite \nLin\n\ne\n\n? ? 18 ( )\u2030\n\n?\n \n\nD\n(\n\n)\n\u2030\n\nL E G E N D\nShallow groundwater\nMeteoric water\nKa+Kb kaolinite of Soft kaolin\nKc kaolinite of Soft kaolin\nKc kaolinite of Semi-flint\n\nB)\n\nA)\n\n \n \nFigure 4.5 Binary diagram with plots of ?D and ?18O isotopic values of the kaolinites of the study \narea, as well as of the modern meteoric water and groundwater.

Although the studied strata are freshly \n\nexposed, modern kaolinitization is possible considering the geographic location in a humid \n\nequatorial area, where descending waters might have an influence at several meters of depth. To \n\ntest this possibility, the ?18O and ?D values of a kaolinite in equilibrium with the modern meteoric \n\nwater were estimated with basis on the measured ?18O and ?D values for this water. Despite the \n\nfact that only one water sample for each studied locality was collected, the resulting ?18O and ?D \n\nvalues revealed to be consistent with meteoric waters obtained from other Amazonian areas (see \n\nSalati et al., 1979).  \n\nOnce the ?18O and ?D values from the meteoric waters are known, the isotope values of a \n\nkaolinite formed in equilibrium with these waters can be estimated with basis on the following \n\nequations of Savin and Epstein (1970a): \n\n \n\n                       1+?18Okao/1000 \n\n??x(kao-water)=   _________________                       (1)\n\n                       1+?18Owater/1000 \n\n \n\n                       1+?Dkao/1000 \n\n??y(kao-water)=   _________________                       (2)\n\n                       1+?Dwater/1000 \n\n \n\nWhere ??x(kao-water) and ??y(kao-water) are the kaolinite fractionation factors with respect to \n\noxygen and hydrogen, respectively. According to measurements considering samples collected \n\nfrom a wide geographic distribution, these authors, as well as Lambert and Taylor (1971), \n\nproposed that the ??x(kao-water)=1.027 and ??x(kao-water)=0.97. If these values are applied to the study \n\n 90\n\n\n\n 91\n\narea, then the ?18Okao and ?Dkao values expected to be in equilibrium with the meteoric water in \n\nthe modern environment would be 26.69\u2030 and 25.25\u2030, and \u201333.98\u2030 and \u201331.07\u2030 in the \n\nPPSA and IRCC quarries, respectively.  \n\nTo test these values, calculations of the ?18Okao and ?Dkao isotope values were also \n\nobtained directly applying the equations: \n\n \n\n1000 ln?(kao-water)=2.5 (106) (T-2)-2.87 for the oxygen                           (3) \n\n(Land and Dutton, 1978)                  \n\n \n\n1000 ln?(kao-water)=-4.53 (106) (T-2)+19.4 for the hydrogen                    (4) \n\n(Lambert and Epstein, 1980)        \n\n \n\nWhere T is the modern annual mean temperature, which is 28oC (or 301oK) for the study \n\narea. Considering these equations, the obtained ?18Okao and ?Dkao values revealed to be very close \n\nto the above, i.e., 24.72\u2030 and 23.70\u2030 for the ?18O, and \u201334.01 \u2030 and -31.10\u2030 for the ?D in the \n\nPPSA and IRCC quarries, respectively.  \n\nThe data obtained from the two procedures presented above are comparable, and revealed \n\n?18O and ?D values that are much heavier than those measured from any of the kaolinite samples \n\ncollected from the study area. Therefore, the measured kaolinite isotope data are not in \n\nequilibrium with the modern weathering environment.  \n\nThe Ipixuna Formation is often overlain by a Miocene and/or post-Miocene succession, \n\nknown as the Barreiras and Post-Barreiras Formation (Santos Jr. and Rossetti, 2003; Rossetti, \n\n2004). In the particular case of the studied profiles, these deposits average 25 m thick. Despite the \n\nporous nature imposed by the prevalence of well sorted and well rounded sandstones, it is \n\npresumed that this thickness, added to the presence of shales and, locally, iron cements along \n\nunconformities (see Rossetti, 2004), might have acted as barrier for descending waters in the \n\nmodern environment.  \n\nHence, the measured isotope values of the kaolinite samples might reflect the isotope \n\ncomposition of either past meteoric or groundwaters that have been in contact with the Ipixuna \n\nFormation since its deposition. Alternatively, the data might be related to contaminations caused \n\n 91\n\n\n\n 92\n\nby primary or authigenic minerals that could be not eliminated from the samples, as discussed in \n\nthe following.    \n\n \n\n4.5.2 Isotope behavior of the Ka+Kb kaolinites \n\n \n\nThe basic principle used for interpreting kaolinite isotope data is that, once formed, this \n\nmineral remains isotopically unaltered under surface and near-surface conditions (Lawrence and \n\nTaylor, 1971, 1972; O\u2019Neil and Kharaka, 1976; Savin and Hsieh, 1998). Thus, the measured \n\nisotope values would reflect the isotopic composition of the water during the kaolinite formation, \n\nunless further mineralogical transformations take place.  \n\nAs shown in the previous session, there is a wide variation of the ?18O values plotted \n\nalong the studied profiles (i.e., 12.79\u2030 and 6.39\u2030 for the PPSA and IRCC quarries, \n\nrespectively), though the range of variation for the ?D (i.e., 9.88\u2030 and 16.40\u2030 for the PPSA and \n\nIRCC quarries, respectively, disregarding samples E14 and E126) is considered negligible (e.g., \n\nZhou and Dobos, 1994). Considering the plots of ?18O versus ?D values (Fig. 4.5) from both \n\nstudied quarries, and comparing them with proposed meteoric (Craig, 1961), kaolinite (Savin and \n\nEpstein, 1970a) and supergene/hypogene (Shepard et al., 1969) lines, a great part of the Ka+Kb \n\nkaolinites would have formed supergenically, but not under influence of the paleoweathering. \n\nConsidering this diagram, it could also be indicated that a significant amount of these kaolinites, \n\nparticularly in the PPSA quarry, would have been related to a hypogene origin. However, under \n\nthis condition, a more stable kaolinite polymorph would be dickite (Savin and Epstein, 1970a), \n\nwhich was not found in the studied deposits, even as traces. It seems that the hypogene origin \n\nsuggested in this diagram is due to the large variation of the ?18O values, at the same time that the \n\ncorresponding ?D values remained relatively constant. Therefore, the binary diagram of Figure \n\n4.5, worldwide used for distinguishing kaolinites of various origins, seems to be not very useful \n\nto understand the mode of formation of the kaolinites from the Rio Capim area. \n\nThe relative stability of the ?D values is taken as an indication that once formed the \n\nKa+Kb kaolinites of the studied area remained isotopically stable. Under isotopic fractionation at \n\nlow temperature, the hydrogen exchange between the mineral and the associated water occurs at \n\nmuch higher rates than with the oxygen, usually negligible (O\u2019Neil and Kharaka, 1976; Bird and \n\nChivas, 1988, Longstaffe and Ayalon, 1990). Thus, the cause for the wide oscillation of the ?18O \n\n 92\n\n\n\n 93\n\nvalues is not related to equilibrium with interacting waters, but it reflects mineralogical \n\ncontaminations. These issues are discussed in the following, but first one must compare the \n\nisotope values obtained for the kaolinite samples with ancient meteoric and ground waters. This \n\nis necessary in order to decipher whether the kaolinite formed during past weathering or burial \n\nconditions.  \n\nAs widely considered by many authors (e.g., Savin and Epstein, 1970a,b; Lawrence and \n\nTaylor, 1971, 1972; Mizota and Longstaffe, 1996; Janssen, 1985; Giral-Kacmarcik et al., 1998; \n\nGilg, 2000; Gilg et al., 2003; Girard et al., 2000), the groundwater collected today from a given \n\nstratigraphic unit would keep the isotopic composition of the groundwater during the time of \n\nkaolinite formation. Knowing the ?18O and ?D values for the groundwater, the temperature from \n\nthis water can be calculated through the equation: \n\n \n\n?18Owater = -11.99+0.338 T (oC)          (Yurstever and Gat, 1981)         (5) \n\n \n\nApplication of this equation to the Rio Capim area indicates a groundwater temperature \n\naround 19.2oC. To calculate the ?18O value for the ancient meteoric water, an estimation of the \n\npaleotemperature at the surface must be provided. The Ipixuna Formation seems to have been \n\ndeposited in an altitude similar to its present location. This is suggested by the altitude of the \n\nIpixuna Formation in the Rio Capim, which is comparable to those areas where this unit is \n\noverlain by a well developed lateritic paleosol, recorded in adjacent tectonically stable terrains. \n\nAssuming that tectonics was negligible, a surface water temperature of nearly 17.2 oC can be \n\nestimated, considering a thermal gradient of circa 2oC, for a maximum burial of 60-70 m. This \n\ntemperature is consistent with global temperature values, which estimates colder late Cretaceous \n\nto early Tertiary climates, characterized by temperatures ranging from 15-20oC (Savin, 1977). \n\nApplying the estimated ancient surface temperature to equation (5), the ?18O value for the \n\nsurface water is \u20136.17\u2030, disregarding seasonal fluctuations. This value can be applied to the \n\ngeneral equation (6) or the proposed local equation (7) in order to calculate the ?D for the \n\ncorresponding water, as follows: \n\n \n\n?D=8 ?18O+10 (Craig, 1961)            (6) \n\n \n\n 93\n\n\n\n 94\n\n?D=8.1 ?18O+11 (Reis et al., 1977)      (7) \n\n \n\nBased on these calculations, the ?D values for the ancient surface water in the Rio Capim \n\narea are \u201339.41\u2030 and \u201338.97\u2030, respectively. Applying these values to equations (3) and (4), and \n\ncombining with equations (1) and (2), the ?18Okao and ?Dkao formed in equilibrium with the \n\nancient meteoric water would have been equivalent to 20.84\u2030 and \u201371.77\u2030 (-71.35\u2030 if \n\n?Dwater=\u201338.97\u2030), respectively. On the other hand, applying these same procedures, but using \n\nthe ?18O=-4.9\u2030 and ?D=-22.5\u2030 obtained for the groundwater, the ?18Okao and ?Dkao formed in \n\nequilibrium with this groundwater would have been equivalent to 21.73\u2030 and \u201355.43\u2030, \n\nrespectively. \n\nTherefore, it can be noticed from the above development that the ?18O values for the \n\nKa+Kb kaolinites calculated from both the ancient meteoric water and the temporally equivalent \n\ngroundwater are heavier than the values measured from the kaolinite samples, while the ?D \nvalues do not differ much. This is also shown by calculations of fractional factors using the \n\nisotope data measured from Ka+Kb kaolinites, considering the ?18O and ?D values calculated for \n\nthe ancient surface water, and using equations (1) and (2), resulted in values for the oxygen of \n\n1.009 and 1.010 and for the hydrogen of 0.97 and 0.97 for the PPSA and IRCC, respectively. \n\nThese fractionation values are much lower than the ??x(kao-water)=1.027 expected in weathering \n\nenvironments, while for the hydrogen are coincident (Savin and Epstein, 1970; Lawrence and \n\nTaylor, 1971, 1972). \n\nBased only on the above comparisons, one cannot distinguish whether the Ka+Kb \n\nkaolinites formed in a diagenetic environment or associated to a paleoweathering. On the other \n\nhand, as previously mentioned, our ongoing studies point to formation of Ka+Kb kaolinites under \n\ninfluence of intrastratal fluids during sediment burial. This is suggested by the coarse-grained \n\nnature of the kaolinite crystals that are formed by replacement of framework grains. This \n\ncharacteristic, added to the good preservation of the sedimentary structures, is more consistent \n\nwith mineralogical replacements taking place at a certain depth. Given the similarities of the \n\nisotopic values obtained for the Ka+Kb kaolinites with the estimated isotopic signal of kaolinites \n\nformed near the surface and under influence of groundwater, one can propose that the diagenetic \n\nenvironment was most likely located still under influence of the paleoenviroment, i.e., during \n\nearly diagenesis. Under this condition, mineralogical replacements might take place at low \n\n 94\n\n\n\n 95\n\npressure and temperature, and the intrastral waters might receive a contribution from descending \n\nmeteoric waters, which might result in isotopic exchanges.  \n\nConsidering the isotopic equilibrium of the Ka+Kb kaolinites with shallow groundwaters, \n\nthe wide variation of the ?18O values could be attributed to mineralogical contaminations from \n\nframework grains. As shown by optical studies, the soft kaolin, dominated by Ka and Kb \n\nkaolinites, displays horizons with quartz, feldspar and muscovite grains, in great part derived \n\nfrom igneous (including volcanics) and metamorphic rocks. These minerals, though subordinate, \n\nshow variable rates of replacement by kaolinites. During this process, the kaolinite must go \n\ncompletely into solution in order to adopt the isotopic composition of the interacting waters \n\n(Jassen, 1985). It seems that not all the framework grains were completely dissolved to form the \n\nkaolinite. In fact, there are many examples of entirely kaolinitized quartz and feldspar grains \n\npreserving their original shapes, meaning they did not go completely into solution before \n\nkaolinite was formed. Under this condition, it is more likely that the kaolinite will retain at least \n\nsome of the isotope composition of the parent mineral, instead of going into equilibrium with \n\ninteracting waters. Studies performed on a large number of igneous and metamorphic rocks \n\nindicate low ?18O values that are usually lower relative to corresponding kaolinites (Silverman, \n\n1951; Taylor and Epstein, 1962; Garlick and Epstein, 1967). Therefore, it is possible that the \n\nlower ?18O values of the Ka+Kb kaolinites (i.e., average of 14.83\u2030 and 16.47\u2030 for the PPSA \n\nand IRCC quarries, respectively) relative to the calculated groundwater (i.e., 21.73\u2030) reflect a \n\nlower isotopic composition of the parent materials. As the large bulk of the minerals present in \n\nthe framework, with exception of muscovite, do not show hydrogen in their composition, only the \n\noxygen would respond to this mineralogical contamination, while the hydrogen would show \n\nequilibrium with the interacting water.  \n\n \n\n4.5.3 Isotope behavior of the Kc kaolinites \n\n \n\n Considering only the soft kaolin unit, the isotope data for both oxygen and hydrogen of \n\nthe Kc kaolinite are much more variable when compared to the Ka+Kb kaolinites. As occurs with \n\nthose kaolinites, the measured isotope data of the Kc kaolinite display lower ?18O and lighter ?D \n\nvalues than those expected for kaolinites that would have been formed in contact with the modern \n\nmeteoric water. The isotope ?18O and ?D values measured from the Kc kaolinite are lighter than \n\n 95\n\n\n\n 96\n\nthe expected values calculated above for both the ancient meteoric water and the temporally \n\ncorresponding groundwater. In addition, the fractionation factors calculated using the same \n\nprocedure as indicated for the Ka+Kb kaolinites, i.e., considering the ?18O and ?D values \n\ncalculated for the ancient surface water, resulted in values for the oxygen of 1.0134 and 1.013, \n\nand for the hydrogen of 0.937 and 0.922 for the PPSA and IRCC, respectively. Combination of \n\nthese data led to the conclusion that the oxygen and the hydrogen are not in equilibrium, neither \n\nwith the ancient meteoric water, nor with the corresponding groundwater. \n\n The large variation of the Kc kaolinite from the soft kaolin on both isotope values (Figs. \n\n4.3-5) might be attributed to significant isotopic exchange after kaolinite formation. The fact that \n\nthe ?18O curves from both of the studied quarries follow the same pattern of oscillation than the \n\ncorresponding Ka+Kb kaolinites is taken as an indication that the Kc kaolinites originated, at \n\nleast in part, from replacement of those kaolinites. Regardless the isotopic exchanges, the finer-\n\ngrained kaolinite seems to still keep the isotopic signature of the coarser-grained kaolinites. It is \n\nnoteworthy that these interpretations are in good agreement with optical studies, which indicate \n\nformation of Kc kaolinites from Ka+Kb kaolinites, as previously mentioned on the geological \n\ncontext session. In addition, it is important to remember that our ongoing studies also reveal that \n\na large volume of the Kc kaolinite in the soft kaolin unit derives directly from replacement of \n\ndetritic clay minerals associated to muddy layers interbedded with sandstones. The presence of \n\nquartz, feldspar and muscovite grains in the silty fraction of these mudstones might have also \n\ncaused isotopic contamination, as discussed for the case of the Ka+Kb kaolinites.  \n\nHowever, part of the Kc kaolinite from the soft kaolin unit might have additionally \n\nformed during the development of a paleosol horizon related to the top unconformity. In part, this \n\nis demonstrated by the fact that there is a gradual upward increase in the frequency of Kc \n\nkaolinite near this unconformity. The paleosol is more expressive in the PPSA quarry (Fig. 4.3), \n\nwhere the more stable ?18D values obtained for corresponding samples (i.e., E18, E19 and E21) \n\nindicate a fractional factor of 0.97 for the hydrogen, calculated with basis on the estimated \n\nancient meteoric water. This value fits perfectly with the ??y(kao-water) = 0.97 expected in \n\nweathering environments (Savin and Epstein, 1970; Lawrence and Taylor, 1971, 1972). Thus, it \n\nis proposed that as the soft kaolin unit was exposed to the surface, its interaction with ancient \n\nmeteoric waters might have initiated an isotopic re-equilibration, with a first response on the \n\nhydrogen, in general more suitable for isotopic exchange.   \n\n 96\n\n\n\n 97\n\nFor the case of the Kc kaolinite from the semi flint unit, the isotope values are, in general, \n\nrelatively lighter than the isotopic composition of the kaolinite calculated from the groundwater \n\nand ancient meteoric water (Tab. 1). Exception is the hydrogen values, which are comparable \n\n(i.e.,&lt;10\u2030) to those obtained for the ancient meteoric water (Figs. 4.3 and 4.4). In addition, the \n\nfractional factors with respect to the oxygen calculated for the ancient surface water is 1.012 and \n\n1.011, and for the hydrogen is 0.957 and 0.96 for the PPSA and IRCC quarries, respectively. \n\nThus, only the hydrogen is in equilibrium with this water.  \n\n Considering that the semi-flint unit is strongly affected by pedogenesis (e.g., \n\nTruckenbrodt et al., 1991; Kotschoubey et al., 1996; 1999; Costa and Moraes, 1998), it would be \n\nexpected to have both isotopes in equilibrium with the calculated ancient meteoric water. \n\nHowever, the origin of the kaolinite in the semi-flint unit is complex. In part, there seems to have \n\ndetrital kaolin derived from the underlying soft kaolin unit (Rossetti and Santos Jr., 2006). These \n\nare mixed with kaolinite derived from a paleoweathering, which did not take place necessarily \n\nonly in one phase (Rossetti, 2004). In addition, our ongoing studies reveal that the top of the \n\nsemi-flint unit display fractures filled by kaolinite booklets, which could not be extracted from \n\nthe analyzed samples. It is also noteworthy to recall that the semi-flint unit is highly \n\ncontaminated with iron oxides. All these factors might have acted together in order to result in a \n\ncomplex isotopic signature for the Kc kaolinite. \n\n  \n\n 97\n\n\n\n 98\n\n4.6 CONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\n The main conclusions that arise from this study are: \n\n \n\n1. The results obtained from ?18O and ?D analyses revealed values that are consistent when \n\nboth of the studied profiles are compared. \n\n2. None of the isotope curves are in equilibrium with calculated values of kaolinites that \n\nwould be formed in equilibrium with the modern local meteoric water. \n\n3. Tests made with different grain sizes indicated values that are similar for the Ka and Kb \n\nkaolinites, but these display values that are not comparable to the Kc kaolinites, even \n\nwhen samples from a same stratigraphic unit are compared. These differences in isotopic \n\ndata are related to distinct genesis for the two analyzed kaolinite categories. \n\n4. Binary diagrams contrasting ?18O and ?D values, worldwide applied for distinguishing \n\nsupergenic from hypogenic kaolinites, as well as those formed under weathering \n\nconditions, can not be applied to the Rio Capim Kaolin. In the case of the Ka+Kb \n\nkaolinites of the soft kaolin unit, this is because the ?18O values display a large range of \n\nvariation, while the ?D is relatively constant, which results in plots of several samples \n\ninto the hypogenic field. In addition, the corresponding Kc kaolinite for both isotopes \n\ndisplay highly oscillating curves, with ?D that are anomalously light when compared with \n\nmost of the kaolinites described in the literature. This characterizes samples recording \n\nisotopic exchanges after kaolinite formation.  \n\n5. Despite these problems, optical studies, combined with comparisons of ?D isotope values \n\nfrom the Ka+Kb kaolinites, led to suggest that these reflect values expected for kaolinites \n\nformed in contact with the groundwater. The discrepant ?18O values are attributed to \n\nmineralogical contaminations imposed by the different degrees of replacement of quartz, \n\nfeldspar, muscovite and lithics grains. The large variation of the Kc kaolinite isotopic \n\nvalues in the soft kaolin unit shows significant exchange after kaolinite formation. \n\nHowever, a similar pattern of variation of the ?18O curves on both of the studied area is \n\nattributed to an origin linked to coarser grained kaolinites formed in the sandstones, as \n\nwell as detrital clays from mudstones, which also contain mineralogical contaminants \n\nsimilar to the sandstones in the silty grain size. \n\n 98\n\n\n\n 99\n\n6. Although the semi-flint contains a large volume of paleosol, the ?18O and ?D isotope \n\nvalues indicated that the corresponding Kc kaolinite is not in equilibrium with the ancient \n\nmeteoric water. This is attributed to the fact that the origin of these kaolinites might have \n\nbeen variable, including kaolinites derived from the underlying soft kaolin unit, kaolinites \n\nformed during different phases of paleoweathering, as well as later phases of coarse-\n\ngrained kaolinites formed along fractures. \n\n7. The present investigation undertaken in the Rio Capim area led to the conclusion that the \n\napplication of ?18O and ?D might help to substantially increase the understanding of the \n\nprocesses involved in the kaolinite formation, particularly when combined with optical \n\ninformation.    \n\n 99\n\n\n\n 100\n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\nAZEVEDO R.P. 1991.
