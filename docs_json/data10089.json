Currently, high intensity light-\nemitting diodes (LED) units are available. These are less energy-\nconsuming than halogen lamps and need no external cooling[1, 3, 4], \nproviding important advantages over the QTH lamps.\n\nPhoto-curing dental composites are basically composed of \norganic matrix, inorganic filler, coupling agents and photo initiators. \nThe most common initiator, camphorquinone (CQ), is activated by \nlight in the wavelength range of 450-470 nm, which corresponds \nto visible blue light. Photoactivation of the resin composite has \nbeen done with halogen lamps since the 1980s. However, in recent \nyears, alternatives to halogen lamp have appeared, including blue \nlight-emitting diodes (LEDs)[3]. The peak of absorption of CQ, at \n468 nm, is the same wavelength as the emission of LED units. Light-\nemitting diodes are semiconductors that liberate photons when \nelectricity passes by them. Hence, LED sources generate less heat \nthan conventional sources, because more energy is transformed into \nluminous energy than in light generation by incandescence. Each \nLED has a working lifetime of over 10,000 hours, while halogen \nbulbs have a limited effective lifetime of about 40-100 hours[4].\n\nThe degree of conversion of monomer to polymer in the resin \ncomposite has an important effect on the clinical effectiveness of \nrestoration, because proprieties like biocompatibility, dimensional \nstability and wear resistance increase and water sorption and \nsolubility decrease when the degree of conversion is enhanced[5]. \nRestoration materials can be dissolved in the oral environment, \nleaching soluble component, discoloring and degrading the \ncomposite resin bulk[5], and consequently limiting its durability. \nSuperficial microhardness tests are an indirect method of \ndetermining the degree of conversion[6]. Already, nanohardness \ntests allow the evaluation of other proprieties like elastic modulus[7]. \nThis propriety is important for evaluating the tension of union tooth/\nrestoration[8], because a high elastic modulus decreases the flow \ncapacity of material, causing interfacial stress[9]. The aim of this \nstudy is to evaluate a composite polymerized by LED to examine its \nwater sorption, solubility, nanohardness and elastic modulus values.\n\nExperimental\n\nMaterials\n\nFour curing units (one QTH and three LED) were used to \ntest water sorption, solubility, nanohardness and elastic modulus \ndetermination of a composite resin. Units, manufacturers and \ncharacteristics are shown in Table 1.

O. et al. - Effect of light sources on nanohardness, elastic modulus and water sorption of a composite resin\n\na Fischerscope System HV 100. A Berkivich (small three-sided \npyramid) indenter was pressed into specimens with 250 mN of load \nfor 20 seconds, followed by 20 seconds of unloading. Nanohardness \n(MPa) and elastic modulus (GPa) values were obtained using the \nsame device and indentation with intervals of 1 mm of depth from \nthe top. For each millimeter in depth, 4 indentations were made \n1 mm apart from each one and the values for each depth were \nobtained by taking the arithmetic mean of the 4 indentations of every \nline, representing 1, 2 and 3 mm of depth.\n\nData were subjected to a two-way ANOVA and Tukey test \nfor multiple comparisons at the 0.05 level of significance for \nnanohardness and elastic modulus, as well as a one-way ANOVA \nand Student-Newman-Keuls test for water sorption and solubility. \nA Pearson correlation analysis of the relationship between \nnanohardness and elastic modulus values was performed with a \nsignificance level of 0.05.\n\nResults\n\nWater sorption and solubility\n\nWater sorption and solubility means and standard deviations \nare shown in Table 2. All specimens are in agreement with ISO \n4049:2000; however, the specimens cured by Radii unit showed \nstatistically lower water sorption values (p &lt;0.05) than the \nspecimens cured with the others curing units.\n\nNanohardness\n\nNanohardness means and standard deviations are shown in \nFigure 1. The depths are compared for each device and among the \ndifferent devices. Groups XL 2500 and L. E. Demetron I showed \nsuperior nanohardness values for 1 mm of depth than for 2 and \n3 mm, in spite of 3 mm depths not showing statistically significant \ndifferences. The Elipar Free Light 2 and Radii groups showed no \nstatistically significant differences between the depths of 1 and \n2 mm or 2 and 3 mm; however, values of 1 mm were statistically \nsuperior to those at 3 mm.\n\nComparing the depth of polymerization among the different \nlight curing units, no statistically significant difference was observed \namong the nanohardness values at of 1 mm depth. Nonetheless, the \nRadii and L. E. Demetron I groups obtained statistically higher \nvalues than did the XL 2500 group at 2 mm. At 3 mm, no significant \ndifference was found among the LEDs, even though the Radii group \nshowed different values than the XL 2500 group.\n\nElastic modulus\n\nElastic modulus means and standard deviations are shown in \nFigure 2. The values were compared among the depths and light-\ncuring units.\n\nGroups XL 2500, Elipar Free Light 2 and L. E. Demetron \nI presented statistically higher values for 1 mm of depth than for \n2 mm and both, higher than 3 mm. No statistical difference was \nshown in the Radii group between 1 and 2 mm of depth, but both of \nthese values were higher than those for 3 mm.\n\nunit was measured with a radiometric device (Demetron for QTH \nand Demetron L.E.D. for LED, Kerr Corp.). The micro hybrid resin \ncomposite Z250 (3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA), color A3, was used.\n\nWater sorption and solubility\n\nWater sorption and solubility tests were performed in \ncompliance with ISO 4049:2000. Five resin disks were made in a \nsteel matrix (15 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick). The matrix was \nput directly onto a glass slide and then filled in a single increment. \nAn acetate strip was placed on top of the matrix and then covered \nby a glass slide to drain the material. The glass slide was removed \nand the composite was polymerized for 20 seconds at nine different \npoints (1 in the center and 8 around). The photopolymerization was \nrepeated on the opposite face and then the disks were immediately \nplaced in a stove at 37 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C. Fifteen minutes after the beginning \nof the polymerization, the disks were removed from the matrix and \nfinishing and polishing procedures were performed with sandpaper \nn\u00ba 320 and a felt disc.\n\nAfter polishing, specimens were placed in a desiccator \ncontaining silica gel at 37 \u00b0C for five hours. Twenty-four hours \nlater, the specimens were transferred to another desiccator at 22 \u00b0C \nfor more 2 hours and then repeatedly weighed at 24 hours intervals \nin an analytical balance (Sartorius BP 2100, Goettingen, Germany) \nuntil a constant mass (m\n\n1\n) was obtained (i.e., until the mass loss of \n\neach specimen was not more than 0.1 mg in any 24 hours period). \nThe diameter and thickness of each disk was measured with a \ndigital caliper to calculate the volume (V) in mm3. Thereafter, the \nspecimens were stored in distilled water at 37 \u00b0C for 7 days. Disks \nwere weighed daily after being slightly dry until a constant weight \nwas obtained (m\n\n2\n). The procedures to obtain m\n\n1\n were repeated to \n\nobtain m\n3\n.

The matrix was \nput directly onto a glass slide and then filled in a single increment. An \nacetate strip was placed on top of the matrix and then covered by a \nglass slide to drain the material. The glass slide was removed and the \ncomposite was photoactivated for 20 seconds. After polymerization, \nspecimens were stored in a dark receptacle for 24 hours at room \ntemperature. All the cylinders from the same group were fixed in \na base of acrylic resin and sectioned under irrigation. The hemi-\ncylinders were finished and polished in an automatic polishing \nmachine (Struers Abramin, Ballerup, Denmark) with sandpaper n\u00ba \n400, 600, 800, 1200 for 2 minutes each; after that specimens were \npolished by a alumina impregnated felt.anohardness and elastic \nmodulus tests were performed 24 hours after polymerization, using \n\nTable 1.

O. et al. - Effect of light sources on nanohardness, elastic modulus and water sorption of a composite resin\n\nDiscussion\n\nThere are many aspects involved in the polymerization process, \nsuch as material composition, type and concentration of the photo \ninitiator, wavelength and intensity of the light source, and irradiance \ntime. Many of the contemporary composite and adhesive systems used \nin dentistry that contain dimethacrylate resins are cured by irradiation \nwith visible light. The composition of these photopolymerizable \nmaterials is generally a mixture of poly-functional methacrylate \nmonomers[10]. The tertiary amine/camphorquinone (CQ) complex is \nthe most widely used photosensitizer for visible-light-cured dental \ncomposite resins[1]. The absorption spectra of CQ, ranging from \n450 nm to a maximum of about 490 nm[10], fit perfectly with the \npeak of light emitted by a blue LED. On the other hand, QTH lamps \nemit a large spectrum of radiation (370-515 nm), requiring filters \nto select blue light radiation. Among photoactivator units, the LED \nis an alternative to conventional curing units because it presents \nan enhanced working lifetime, eliminates the need for filters, and \ngenerates less heat and noise[1].\n\nA high degree of polymerization of the resin composite may lead \nto superior physical and mechanical properties[11]. Microhardness \nvalues are strongly related to the degree of conversion of the resin \ncomposite, as previous studies have shown[12]. A high degree \nof polymerization increases the cross-link density of formed \npolymers[2,13]\n\n,\n leading to a composite restoration with enhanced \n\nmechanical and physical properties less prone to degradation.\nHigh water sorption values and solubility of the post-polymerized \n\nresin composite can be associated with inadequate polymerization, \nwhich reduces the material properties and biocompatibility[14]. \nUnreacted components within the resin composite can react with \nsolvents in the oral environment (i.e., saliva, water, soft drinks). \nThese solvent molecules force polymer chain expansion, decreasing \nthe internal forces and leading to polymer degradation[15]. In our \ntests, resin disks cured by the Radii light source showed less water \nsorption than those treated with other curing units (P &lt;0.05), \nindicating an increase in stability of the composite resin restorations. \nFurthermore, increased water sorption of a composite restoration \ncould be harmful to the color stability of the restoration, leading to \nearly aesthetic failure. The solubility of dental composites reflects \nthe amount of unreacted monomers and other low-weight molecules \nsuch as filler particle compounds and photoinitiators that have been \nleached into the water[14]. The elution of unreacted components \ncould result in diffusion through dentinal tubules, causing cytotoxic \neffects on pulp cells[16]. Moreover, restorative procedures with more \nsorptive materials could lead to decreased treatment longevity.\n\n One of the most frequently used indirect methods for verifying \nthe degree of conversion of resin composite polymerization is \nthe hardness test[17]. The nano-indentation technique has several \nadvantages for hardness determination over conventional micro-\nhardness methods and offers a broader range of applications, since \ninformation on hardness as well as on the elastic modulus of a \nmaterial can be obtained[18]. Analysis of the nanohardness results \nfrom our trials shows that with a 1 mm depth indentation specimens \npresented no statistical differences among the photo-curing units. \nHowever, at deeper indentations at resin composite, increased \nnanohardness values were shown (p &lt;0.05) (Figure 1). The use of \nclinical increments with more than 2 or 2.5 mm should be avoided \nto achieve a less degradable polymer.\n\nElastic modulus has an important role during stress generation \ncaused by polymerization shrinkage. Stress generation is a \nparameter for the clinical performance of restorations[19]. Since \nstress is the product of elastic modulus and strain, a high volumetric \nshrinkage combined with a high elastic modulus generates a higher \nstress of polymerization[19], increasing marginal failures[20], color \n\nTable 2.

For \nthe depths of 2 and 3 mm, the XL 2500 group showed statistically \nlower elastic modulus values than the other groups. The Pearson \ncorrelation coefficient was used to evaluate the correlation between \nnanohardness and elastic modulus values. In all combinations of \ngroups and depth are positive and strong, r2 > 0.80 (p &lt;0.01).\n\nPol\u00edmeros, vol. 21, n\u00ba 2, p. 103-106, 2011 105\n\n\n\nJuchem, C. O. et al. - Effect of light sources on nanohardness, elastic modulus and water sorption of a composite resin\n\nchanges[21,22] and cuspal deflection[23]. Therefore, a restorative \nmaterial should present an elastic modulus similar to dentin \n(19 GPa)[18] and a low shrinkage of polymerization. A high volume \nof organic matrix or inadequate polymerization could promote a \nlow elastic modulus, although compromising other properties of \nthe material. In this study, a Pearson correlation showed a positive \nrelationship between nanohardness and eleastic modulus These \nresults show that the source with less light intensity (600 mW.cm\u20132) \nled to lower elastic modulus values at 2 and 3 mm of depth. This \ncan be explained because higher light intensities produce enhanced \nphysical and mechanical properties for dental composite resins[24] \nand this difference appears at increased depths.\n\nThe luminous intensities were different for each light-curing \nunit tested in this study. The halogen lamp was used as a control \ngroup for polymerization. Analyzing the results for elastic modulus \nvalues, it is notable that there was a significant difference between \nthe halogen unit (i.e., XL2500 with 600 mW.cm\u20132) and the other \ncuring units at depths of 2 and 3 mm. The increased distance \nbetween the resin composite and the light source coupled with light \nattenuation caused by reflection, scattering and absorption of light \nreduces the energy absorbed by the resin composite[25]. The degree \nof conversion of composite resins increased with higher levels of \nirradiant energy. Initial free radical generation of dimethacrylate \nmonomers is directly related to the irradiance absorbed by the \ncomposite. The rate of polymerization of resin composites is \nproportional to the square root of absorbed light intensity and \nphoto-initiator concentration, as shown elsewhere[26]\n\n,\n and a high rate \n\nof polymerization could lead to high nanohardness and low water \nsorption and solubility. However, a high rate of polimerization could \nalso lead to a high elastic modulus, which could increase restoration \nmarginal gap, given that high polymerization shrinkage is related to \nhigh light intensity[27].\n\nConclusion\n\nLight source influences the water sorption, nanohardness values \nand elastic modulus of the resin composite restoration.\n\nReferences\n\n 1.
