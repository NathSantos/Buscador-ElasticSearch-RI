On the right bank of the Sorraia River near the Tagus River the Chalcolithic farm of Cabe\u00e7o do P\u00e9 da Erra (CPE) was an island deeply affected by the Flandrian Transgression, currently an area with Quercus suber. The site is bounded by a ditch with U configuration - corresponding to two construction phases - in partial overlap. In the inner area surrounded by the ditch domestic contexts have been identified highlighting the presence of a set of at least nine huts with bedrock and clay walls. Cooking areas were identified as well as knapping activity of schist and flint, cheese production, weaving and grinding activities.\nAbsolute dating and stratigraphical analysis show three phases of occupation: Phase 1 (2817-2665 calBCE 2 o), with sparse occupation and the presence of a workshop, producing engraved schist plaques. Phase 2 (2633-2474 calBCE 2 o), with the construction of the ditch and the huts. Phase 3 (2382-2139 calBCE 2 o) is the time of abandonment, in which we found traces of a violent fire.\nA detailed reconstruction of the ditch of Cabe\u00e7o do P\u00e9 da Erra is unfortunately limited by the bad conditions for the preservation of organic matter on the site. Resources related to the construction of domestic structures (wood, sandstone, clay) could be raised in the near vicinity (5km). Most of the lithic resources (schist, jaspoide schist, granite) could be exploited at regional level at distances of about 20km. Clearly the raw materials of extraregional origin are represented in small numbers in the archaeological record of CPE: flint, variscite and copper. Most likely exchange networks in the 3rd mill. also reflect social and symbolic aspects. Set in a passing zone, CPE is located between two areas with a marked cultural identity: the Portuguese Estremadura and the Peninsular Southwest.\nResumo\n2012 e 2015. Situada na margem esquerda do Baixo Tejo, junto ao Rio Sorraia, a quinta calcol\u00edtica do Cabe\u00e7o do P\u00e9 da Erra (CPE) encontrava-se numa ilha profundamente afectada pela transgress\u00e3o flandriana, actualmente numa \u00e1rea de montado, e regista um excepcional estado de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o. O s\u00edtio est\u00e1 delimitado por um fosso com configura\u00e7\u00e3o em U, correspondendo a duas fases construtivas, em sobreposi\u00e7\u00e3o parcial. Na \u00e1rea interna delimitada pelo fosso, foram identificados contextos dom\u00e9sticos, destacando-se a presen\u00e7a de um conjunto de um m\u00ednimo de 9 cabanas com base de pedra e paredes de argila. Identificaram-se \u00e1reas de cozinha, actividade de talhe da pedra, produ\u00e7\u00e3o de queijo, tecelagem, moagem. As data\u00e7\u00f5es absolutas e a leitura estratigr\u00e1fica permitem identificar tr\u00eas fases de ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o: a fase 1 (2817-2665 cal a.n.e. 2 o), com ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o esparsa e a presen\u00e7a de um atelier de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de placas de xisto; fase 2 (2633-2474 cal a.n.e. 2 o), com constru\u00e7\u00e3o de um fosso defensivo e das cabanas; a fase 3 (2382-2139 cal a.n.e. 2 o) corresponde ao momento de abandono, o qual teria sido r\u00e1pido e com sinais de combust\u00e3o violenta. A reconstitui\u00e7\u00e3o alargada dos recursos do Cabe\u00e7o do P\u00e9 da Erra est\u00e1 infelizmente limitada pelas m\u00e1s condi\u00e7\u00f5es de preserva\u00e7\u00e3o da mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica registadas no s\u00edtio. Os recursos relacionados com a constru\u00e7\u00e3o das estruturas dom\u00e9sticas (madeira, arenito, argila) poderiam ser captados no entorno pr\u00f3ximo (5km). A maior parte dos recursos l\u00edticos (xisto, xisto jasp\u00f3ide, granito), poderia ser explorada a n\u00edvel regional, em dist\u00e2ncias de at\u00e9 20km. As mat\u00e9rias-primas claramente de origem extrarregional encontram-se representadas em reduzido n\u00famero no registo arqueol\u00f3gico de CPE: s\u00edlex, variscite e cobre.

The site was\nidentified in 1980 following a fortuitous discovery and one of us (Victor S. Gon\u00e7alves) directed excavations at Cabe\u00e7o do P\u00e9 da Erra (CPE) between 1983 and 1985 (Gon\u00e7alves 1983/1984). The works gave rise to the programme entitled ANSOR - Anthropi-sation of the Sorraia Valley (Gon\u00e7alves/Daveau 1983/1984) covering an extensive diachronic period: from the 6th to the 3rd mill. BCE. In 2010 the ANSOR project was recovered under the management of the authors of this article promoted by UNIARQ (Centre for Archaeology - University of Lisbon) with funding from the Coruche County.\nContinuously, starting with the first phase of the project, a special privilege was given to the integrated study of the landscape of the Sorraia Valley: new geophysical surveys were carried out, together with studies of the materials collected in previous archaeological works (Monte da Barca/ Gon\u00e7alves 2011) and in excavations at various archaeological sites from the Early Neolithic (Casas Novas) to the Chalcolithic period (CPE and Barranco do Farinheiro).\nThe archaeological works at CPE form the central core of the ANSOR project with four new excavation campaigns having been undertaken. The works began in 2011 with the geophysical survey, followed by excavation campaigns in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, with an area of 538m1 2 already having been excavated. Although this present study focuses exclusively on CPE, this site cannot be conceived of in an isolated fashion, both in terms of its landscape and the resources transported there via the Sorraia River and in diachronic or synchronic terms.\n2.\tThe Lower Tagus Basin and the Sorraia Valley: Landscape and Settlement in the 3rd Millennium BCE\nThe area under study is located on the left bank of the Lower Tagus River Basin. The Lower Tagus Basin is 85km long and between 5 and 10km wide, with a huge number of tributaries. The area has an unsymmetrical shape caused by the terraces on the left bank, in the Tertiary Basin. The length and width of the Tagus basin undoubtedly contributed to the complexity of the sedimentary dynamics of this watercourse, from the Last Glacial Maximum\nuntil the present day, a situation that is unparalleled in Europe (Vis et al. 2008, 1683).\nHistorical sources clearly show the changes that have taken place in the Tagus Basin, ranging from the descriptions of Antiquity (Strabo) to the cartography of Fernando Alvaro Secco (1560). It was with Suzanne Daveau that the studies of the Tagus were extended to include prehistory, with her seminal text \u2018Espa\u00e7o e Tempo\u2019 (Daveau 1980). More recently, G. J. Vis undertook some new analytical studies in the Lower Tagus basin (Vis et al. 2008; Vis 2009). According to this author, at the beginning of the Late Glacial Maximum, in roughly 12,000 calBC, the Tagus was transformed into a river with just one single channel. It was then that the process of the Flandrian Transgression began, leading to rising sea levels and resulting in a change to a brackish and marshy delta complex. The highest sea levels occurred in 5,000 calBC, when extensive areas of the banks of the Lower Tagus valley were completely submerged over a length of 80km (Vis et al. 2008, 1699). The valleys of the river\u2019s tributaries were also submerged (Vis et al. 2008, 1699) reaching 15km inland. After 5,000 calBC, the transgressive tides stopped and the process of sedimentation of the valley bottoms began to accelerate. When the climatic optimum was reached in 3,000 calBC it is likely that the greater aridity and the change in the vegetation cover increased the rate of sedimentary deposition in the Lower Tagus Basin, a situation that was further exacerbated by the intensive farming of the different historical periods. This transgressive and regressive dynamics of the Lower Tagus Basin erased some archaeological sites, so that it is possible that many of them are hidden by several metres of sedimentation, as has been shown by the geotechnical soundings carried out in this valley (Vis 2009). The invisibility of the prehistoric settlements was further exacerbated by the intensive farming that took place here during different historical periods, namely the recent construction of a series of irrigation channels. These conditioning factors partly explain the absence of any information relating to the Neolithic and Chalcolithic settlements on the left bank of the Lower Tagus River Basin. There is also a shortage of research projects undertaken in this region. The known prehistoric settlements of this region\nwere structured around rivers and small streams that were tributaries of the River Tagus, most notably the Sorraia and the Ribeira de Muge. Located in the Ribeira de Muge are the known Mesolithic shell mounds, with some occurrences of these being found at the surface, which can be integrated into the Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods (Andrade et al. 2015). Most of the known habitats are concentrated in the Sorraia Valley, largely corresponding to the ANSOR research project and some preventive interventions that were made downstream from Coruche (Monte da Foz/Neves 2011; Monte da Quinta/Valera et al. 2006).\nThe Sorraia River is the tributary of the Lower Tagus River that has the largest hydrographical basin (7,730km2), with countless subsidiary tributaries, such as the streams of Erra, Divor, Juliano and the Almansor River. The ANSOR project is centred around the middle section of the Sorraia basin, close to the present-day town of Coruche, where according to Suzanne Daveau the former delta would have been located (Gon\u00e7alves/Daveau 1983/1884, 205). The middle section has the form of an asymmetrical valley in terms of its relief: the right bank (in the north) is short in area, with a ridge of small hills close to the river constituting a genuine \u2018network of gullies\u2019 (Gon\u00e7alves/Daveau 1983/1884, 205). The left bank has a flat morphology, corresponding to Quaternary deposits (Gon\u00e7alves/Daveau 1983/1884, 205). It was along this ridge of small hills that the ANSOR project detected a network of settlements from the 3rd mill.: Entre \u00c1guas, Raia 1, Barranco do Farinheiro, Cabe\u00e7o do P\u00e9 da Erra, Catarroeira, Monte dos Lacraus, Gamas (fig. 2).\nThe banks of the Sorraia River in its middle section also correspond to the terminus of two quite distinct landscapes, between the Ribatejo and the Alentejo. The Ribatejo corresponds to the Tertiary Tagus Basin, the sedimentary substratum, while the Alentejo corresponds to the old massif, the granitic substratum. This location between two different landscapes affords the middle section of the Sorraia Valley a privileged position for access to different abiotic resources and also establishes contact with two regions that, 5,000 years ago, presented quite considerable cultural differences: the Estremadura and the Alentejo (fig. 3).\nFig. 1.

The archaeological site is situated roughly in the centre of a long elevation (54m), bordered to the north by Vale Judeu and to the south by the present-day watercourses of Ribeira da Erra and Sorraia River (fig. 1). In a region that was profoundly affected by the Flandrian Transgression, in the first studies undertaken by UNIARQ, one of the authors of this article (Gon\u00e7alves) and Daveau\nhighlighted the \u2018insular\u2019 nature of Cabe\u00e7o do P\u00e9 da Erra during the climatic optimum, saying that this island amounts to an isolated testimony to the old interfluve between the basin of the Ribeira da Erra and that of the Ribeira de Magos (Gon\u00e7alves/ Daveau 1983/1984, 205).\n3.2.\tGeneral Morphology of the Site\nFig. 3.\tents in Central and South Portugal: 1.

On the slope facing the former Ribeira da Erra (in the north-west), an area of secondary occupation has also been identified (Area 2). There, the total area that was excavated amounted to 536m2. Area 1 has a total area of 800m2 partly bordered by a ditch delimiting a subcircular space in which at least eight housing structures (huts) are located, together with functional areas and rubbish areas on the periphery.\n3.2.1.\tThe Ditches of CPE\nThe ditch was identified through a geophysical survey carried out in 2011 by the Eastern Atlas Company, later confirmed by the soundings undertaken in 2013 and 2014 (fig. 4). This structure marks out a semi-circular area. Apparently, the south-eastern and north-eastern hillsides, which slope naturally, would not have had a ditch, but the geophysical survey did not include these areas, which are covered with trees. Therefore, there may have been a strategy that involved placing the ditch in\nFig. 4.

At both ends of the ditch, one can identify a ground plan that has the shape of a \u2018crab\u2019s pincer\u2019, probably corresponding to distinct phases of construction. The sections excavated in 2013 and 2014 provided evidence of the existence of two completely overlapping ditches (coordinate 12) and areas where there was a partial separation of the line of the ditches with the shape of a \u2018crab\u2019s pincer\u2019 (coordinates 15 and 2). Ditch 1, which is older, is U-shaped, while Ditch 2 is V-shaped. In the southwest area, which was excavated in 2014, it can be seen that the geological base is very irregular, with \u2018gutters\u2019 that were probably used for drainage purposes. There are also differences to be noted in terms of size: Ditch 1 is slightly shallower and narrower. Ditch 2 has a maximum depth of 2.2m. In chronological terms, the two ditches date from different periods in the site\u2019s history: Ditch 1 dates from the 2nd quarter of the 3rd mill. (Beta-386916, Beta-386915 - table 1), while Ditch 2 dates from the 3rd quarter of the 3rd mill. (Beta-394160, Beta-361778 - table 1). An intentional deposition was identified at the bottom of Ditch 1, with remains of Bos primi-genius (aurochs) apparently accompanied by some ceramic vessels.\nThe filling of the ditches reveals a complex dynamic, including phases of slow deposition, originating from erosion and phases when they were actively filled in, above all with levels of combustion and solid clay deposition. The deposition of\nbaked clay, including thermoclasts, can also be seen to have taken place at the top of the Barranco do Farinheiro ditch and it is not yet possible to clarify whether this corresponds to a clay and fire sealing layer or whether it corresponds to the demolition of a protective embankment. Except for the already mentioned deposition of aurochs remains, the archaeological materials found in the ditch were scarce, contrary to what happened at other areas of ditches where there were funerary depositions (Valera 2012).\n3.2.2.\tThe Huts in the Residential Area\nIn Area 1, we find one of the most important groups of mixed structures (stone and clay) of the hut type in the whole of southern Iberia. Having first been detected during the campaigns undertaken in the 1980s, the huts at CPE have made it possible to carry out rigorous analyses of construction techniques and of the forms of occupation adopted by peasant communities in the second (agricultural and metallurgical) phase of the 3rd mill. BCE on the Iberian Peninsula.\nFig. 5. Plan of Cabe\u00e7o do P\u00e9 da Erra, with the layout of the ditch identified by geophysics surveys and structures identified in the 1983-2014 excavations.\nboth cases, the foundations are roughly 0.8m wide, with two outer stone faces filled on the inside with smaller blocks. Vertically, the walls have between one and four rows of stone. In the case of the circular structure (Hut 7) we can note the presence of a significant amount of debris from clay cladding material, which indicates that the walls were built of clay soil. In the case of the semi-circular structures there is a much smaller presence of clay, so that it is possible that the walls were built with vegetal elements (wooden posts and thatch). Closely associated with the huts is the presence of four unstructured combustion areas. The group of\nhuts that have been identified were not occupied simultaneously highlighting the presence of two superimposed structures (Huts 4 and 6). The poor state of preservation of the organic material makes it difficult to obtain a sequence of absolute datings that will allow us to gauge the synchronic and diachronic relationships. The stratigraphic readings that have been obtained would seem to indicate that Hut 7 corresponds to a final phase of occupation, with the contexts of its occupation being completely preserved beneath the thick covering of clay debris that fell from its walls. The solution found for the construction of the two types of hut\nat CPE seems to correspond to the pattern found at most settlements in the south of Portugal from the 3rd mill., both in terms of building techniques (a mixed construction of stone and clay mortars) and in terms of their later evolution, with the appearance of isolated large-sized huts in the final phase of settlement.\n3.2.3.\tActivity Areas\nIn the peripheral space around the nucleus of huts, in the area \u2018inside the ditches\u2019, we can see the presence of activity areas, with an abundant concentration of archaeological materials and the presence of expedient domestic structures. Attention is drawn to the platform on the south-eastern slope (with an area of roughly 108m2) where a sequence of archaeological contexts was identified that were related to various domestic activities. Phase 1 corresponds to a level of occupation associated with a stone cutting area with engraved schist plaques, dating from the first quarter of the 3rd mill. This level was sealed with a large area of stone covering (measuring roughly 5 x 4m), consisting of small-sized pebbles, which possibly served as a pavement.\nPhase 2 shows the profusion of expedient structures (14) composed of pebbles with some thermoclasts sometimes with clay, but without the presence of associated charcoal. These may be structures that were associated with activities that did not require the direct use of fire, such as the drying of hides or fish/meat or that were also used for salt production. There are no organic remains but some fragments of conical vessels were found. These vessels were used to boil salt water, with parallels in Monte da Quinta 2 (Benavente) and Ponta da Passadeira (Barreiro) both on the left bank of the Tagus River. These structures partly cover the stone floor and are scattered all around the platform. The whole platform presents a great density of archaeological materials, namely ceramics, frequently in the form of connecting pieces, indicating combustion activities, possibly related with the preparation of food and/ or the production of salt. There is also evidence of the presence of an operational chain of jaspoid schist starting from tabular slabs. The presence of\nfragments of slaty schist and some preforms of engraved schist plaques seems to point to the continuity of the production of these artefacts or their remobilisation.\nInterrupting these contexts in Phase 3, we note the presence of two ditches with a clear sedimentological definition and a higher density of artefacts, most notably some large connecting ceramic fragments and even some entire vessels. The lower levels of this reality are fairly compact and more blackened, possibly due to the decomposition of organic matter. In one of the ditches (U.E. 39), there was a notable concentration of fragments of a cheese strainer together with an entire vase and in the other ditch (U.E. 41) a notable density of hammerstones and grinding elements. The absolute dating obtained for one of the ditches indicates the third quarter of the 3rd mill., with the most notable feature being the presence of ceramics decorated with a broad acacia leaf, which were almost absent in Phase 3.\nOn the south-western slope, next to the ditch, another activity area was identified, with the detection of remains of a possible loom, with a concentration of loom weights (45). The abundance, fragmentation and diversity of archaeological materials found here would seem to indicate that this was originally a rubbish area, covered with large-sized pebbles.\n3.3.\tTime and Phases in the Occupation of CPE\nThe establishment of the chronological table for the occupation of CPE represents one of the greatest challenges for the interpretation of the site. On the one hand, mention should be made of the acidity of the soils, which profoundly affected the organic matter at CPE making its conservation difficult. The rare bone that was found does not present any collagen and the charcoal does not allow for the identification of the plant species. On the other hand, the site\u2019s scarce stratigraphic power makes it difficult to obtain stratigraphic readings, presenting high levels of pedogenesis, which makes the strata homogeneous in sedimentary terms. Mention should also be made of the presence of numerous structures, so that the choice was made to preserve\nthese for heritage purposes with only occasional necessary interventions being made in the initial phases of occupation. Despite these difficulties the site\u2019s excellent state of conservation and the painstaking care that was taken in the excavation of the contexts made it possible to establish a general and sectoral understanding of the phases, which is due to be complemented in the near future with a new battery of absolute datings that were obtained at the end of the 2015 excavation campaigns.\nAt CPE, generally speaking, we can identify three phases of occupation:\nPhase 1: 2817-2665 calBCE 2 o\nThe first phase of occupation, directly covering the sterile geological substratum, was detected at various points of the excavated area. Possibly in this phase, the ditch had not yet been constructed, so that there was only a sparse occupation of the site with perishable structures. The only dating that is available so far (ICEN 587) was obtained in the first phase of excavations at the site (Gon\u00e7alves 1983/1984), being associated with an area of excavation next to the workshop where the engraved schist plaques were produced. In stratigraphic and sedimentary terms this context is spatially associated with the stratum U.E. 68, covered with the stone paving 60. We can also identify this first level of occupation under Hut 7 (U.E. 94, 107, 106, 105) and in the peripheral area on the south-western slope (U.E. 91).\nPhase 2: 2633-2474 calBCE 2 o\nIn a second phase, the defensive ditch was built (Beta-386916, Beta-386915 - the first filling strata) and probably the semi-circular huts too. Questions relating to the preservation of organic matter have made the dating of this phase rather difficult, especially at Huts 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 and in the activity area. In terms of relative indicators this phase presents some pottery decorated with a narrow acacia leaf with an absence of pots decorated with a broad acacia leaf, wide fluting and geometrical motifs.\nPhase 3: 2382-2139 calBCE 2 o\nThe final phase of occupation of CPE corresponds to the best characterisation of a period in archaeometric terms, with five datings obtained. The site was abandoned very rapidly and all of the\ncontexts are very well preserved. In terms of occupation, there were signs of a new plan for the con-struction/maintenance of the ditch, maintaining roughly the same layout and a similar dynamics in terms of its filling (Beta-394160, Beta-361778). It is possible that the occupation of the \u2018residential\u2019 area was limited to Hut 7, which is exceptional in terms of the preservation of the contexts of its use. In the area between the huts the debris of Hut 7 covered a concentration of entire/complete vessels interpreted as being \u2018cooking\u2019 items with two absolute datings (Beta-331682, Beta-361777). The ditches in the activity area seem to correspond to this final phase (Beta-361776) with one of the ditches having been dated by radiocarbon and with the discovery of an abundant presence of pottery decorated with an acacia leaf.\nEventually we could talk of a \u2018Phase 4\u2019, corresponding to the levels of the site\u2019s abandonment and to the few materials that were found in the upper surface strata expressing the state of preservation of the underlying archaeological contexts. But in fact, this was a short and violent episode that determined the effective end of the site\u2019s settlement.\n4.\tEstimating the Resources at CPE\nAn attempt to roughly estimate the resources of Cabe\u00e7o do P\u00e9 da Erra is naturally limited by the poor state of preservation of the organic matter found at the site. The geological substratum inherent in the Tertiary basin of the Tagus River is very acid and thus the organic remains (fauna, charcoal and seeds) have been almost completely destroyed. Our analysis is therefore centred almost exclusively on the abiotic resources that were needed for constructions and for toolmaking. After the six excavation campaigns that have taken place (1982, 1983, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015), we are still studying materials and undertaking archaeometric analyses and landscape studies. Although these are still at an embryonic stage, the possible reading that we can make for the resources of Cabe\u00e7o do P\u00e9 da Erra allows us to propose some possible future lines of research. The analysis of the resources will centre upon three areas of analysis: the constructions, the material culture and the biotic resources.\n4.1.\tDomestic Architectures and the Raw materials Used for Construction\nObtaining raw materials for construction purposes is usually a matter of expedient access and it is rare to find cases in which raw materials were transported over long distances. This situation is essentially related to megalithic monuments, although recent studies would seem to indicate that the predominant factor was the proximity of quarries from where the orthostats used in the dolmens of southern Portugal were extracted (Boaventura 2009; Moita 2014). Naturally there are exceptions, both at necropolises and in settlements, namely the use of limestone in fortified settlements with a geological substratum of basalt, as was the case at Penedo do Lexim (Sousa 2010) or at Moita da Ladra (Cardoso/Caninas 2010).\nSituated in the middle section of the Sorraia Valley, Cabe\u00e7o do P\u00e9 da Erra was implanted in an area without any materials that could be used in the building of walls, since the soils consisted of a relatively unconsolidated arenitic substratum. Very soft arenitic rock appears at only a few metres in depth. The presence of stone blocks at CPE is thus invariably an indication of the presence of anthropic structures, even if these were later dismantled. It can be seen that sandstone was used exclusively for building the stone bases of the huts, which would have been constructed upwards from this point with the use of perishable elements and clay cladding. These stone blocks could have been quarried in nearby erosive areas or even in the excavated ditch, namely on the south-western slope where the base is rocky. As far as earth constructions are concerned, although the clay that was used is not recorded on the geological map, only appearing at a distance of roughly 20km, it is possible that clay sediment from a closer location was used. At Cabe\u00e7o do P\u00e9 da Erra, there is a predominance of earthen architecture, both in residential constructions and in the boundary structures - ditches. Given that \u2018(...) the earth that is used for construction must contain clay, which functions as a binder, aggregating sands, grit and sometimes gravel\u2019 (Bruno 2010), it will naturally be important to carry out analyses of the different contexts, where the presence of baked clay has been recorded: inside the ditches, in the debris of the huts and in small perishable structures. The\nvolume of clay used in Hut 7 (Phase 3) and in the ditch (Phase 2 and 3) is particularly relevant, since it is fairly implausible that this has such a distant origin. It should be noted that the first geological horizon in the stratigraphy of CPE, for example in the cross section below the stone paving, reveals the presence of clay that could have been used for these constructions.\nThe presence of ditches as a boundary structure may also suggest some ecological determinism: in an area that had no stone that could be used for building purposes, it would be very difficult to choose to build walls. There therefore seems to be a dichotomy between the two banks of the Tagus River. On the right bank, in the Portuguese Estremadura, there is an abundance of fortified settlements (18 in total, the largest such concentration in southern Portugal), while on the left bank the data identified in Coruche would seem to indicate the presence of ditches. In the Alentejo, where areas of ditches coexist with fortified settlements, the building solutions do not seem to have an ecological causality, suggesting that these had their own specific functions and meanings.\n4.2.\tArtefacts and Tools\nFor the artefactual study of CPE, we consider the group of materials collected in the campaigns undertaken between 2012 and 2014, corresponding to a total number of 5,824 materials originating from Area 1, mostly ceramic vessels (64.7%), followed by flaked stone (20.2%) and knapped stone (8.3%). The remaining artefacts all record residual values of less than 3% (cheese strainers, loom weights, artefacts used for personal adornment, artefacts used for sacred purposes, polished stone, by order of their representativeness). Each of these categories of artefacts has its own distinct dynamics in terms of its reception, transformation and use.\n4.2.1.\tFlaked stone\nPreparation\tFlint\tSchist\tJaspoid schist.\tSilic.

Chaine operatoire. Portuguese names for the tools in italics.\nThe local raw materials correspond to schist (72%) and quartz (5%). Quartz was used as a support for expedient toolmaking, with little transformation and tenuous signs of use. Schist effectively corresponds to the main resource used for all types of artefacts with the complete stage of the chaine operatoire being present at the site. Particularly important was jaspoid schist because of its particular fracture characteristics, making it better suited for cutting (fig. 7). In the large activity area located on the terrace overlooking the Sorraia River various concentrations of schist were identified in the working phase including the \u2018cores\u2019, manuports in the form of thin plaques that were used as a support for making various tools, especially arrowheads (fig. 7). The study of these industries, which is currently in progress, is a fairly complex matter\nin view of the physical and mechanical properties of schist, making it difficult to differentiate between cores and flakes, to determine the stages of the chaine operatoire and to determine the point of impact and the butt (Fabregas Valcarce/Rodriguez Rellan 2008, 129).\nThe archaeological bibliography has centred on the study of flint and there have been few studies made of other raw materials of inferior quality that are nonetheless present locally in certain regions, such as schist (Fabregas Valcarce/Rodriguez Rellan 2008, 129). However, local materials tended to predominate in various periods and in distinct chronologies. In settlement contexts of the 3rd mill. there was clearly a local quarrying of these materials for the production of flaked lithic tools, with low percentages of imports from outside.\nFig. 6. Quartzite. On top: flake D.17-215, core J.2-32; Below: hammer B.14-252.\nFig. 7. Jaspoide schist. On top: raw material J.15-9; Below: detail from the arrowhead C.18-2.\nDespite the scarcity of studies of the lithic industry in settlements from the 3rd mill. this tendency has been noted in different geographical contexts: in the Alentejo, at sites such as Porto das Carretas (Soares 2013) or Perdig\u00f5es (Lago et al. 1998) and in the north-west of the Iberian Peninsula, in contexts such as Santuario El Pedroso (F\u00e1bregas Val-carce/Rodr\u00edguez Rell\u00e1n 2008), Crasto de Palheiros (Sanchez 2008), Vinha da Soutilha, S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o and Pastoria (Jorge 1986).\nFlint of non-local origin corresponds to 15% of the total of flaked stones found at CPE, presenting a relatively small percentage of cores (only 6%), whereas jaspoid schist presents a percentage of 16%. It seems clear that most of the artefacts were not worked locally, despite a possible circulation of debitage namely blades, which on the whole were made of flint at CPE (fig. 11). Awls were also made exclusively of flint, on a support of narrow blades.\nIn general terms, toolmaking consisted mainly of arrowheads (60%), followed by products with retouched edges (28%), essentially flakes. In the toolmaking of the 3rd mill. there was always a preponderance of arrowheads regardless of the raw material that was used. We can verify that at the fortified settlements of the Estremadura, where there was an abundance of flint (Sousa 2010; Carvalho 1995/1996), or in the Alentejo, where schist rocks were predominantly used (Soares 2013) the situation is the same. Here, the function was more important than the material. Taking two examples located in distinct geological substrata, we can see that at Penedo do Lexim (Mafra), which is located in a flint area, arrowheads correspond to 24% of retouched tools (the pieces with retouched edges amount to 28%) and at Porto das Carretas arrowheads correspond to only 16% of toolmaking, with only nine examples found (Soares 2013, 209).\nAlthough knapping in the 3rd mill. already presented signs of functional segmentation, with sites that specialised in mining, as well as specialised workshops outside the settlements (Sousa/ Gon\u00e7alves 2011), the production of arrowheads corresponds to one of the exceptions. Since there was a recurrent presence of such tools in settlements contexts as happens for example in sites denoting a proximity to flint, such as Penedo do Lexim (Sousa 2010), Outeiro de S\u00e3o Mamede\n(Jord\u00e3o 2010) or in more distant areas, such as the settlement of metallurgists of Cabezo Jur\u00e9 (Nocete et al. 2004). The identification of areas of arrowhead production at CPE corresponds to the first case detected in situ in Portuguese territory and the only case in which local raw materials other than flint were used.\nThe diachronic reading of resources throughout the phasing of CPE indicates a continuity in the raw material used for knapping, with a slight increase being recorded in the percentage of flint used in Phase 3 (third quarter of the 3rd mill.).\n4.2.2.\tPolished Stone\n\tN\u00b0\t%\nAxe (machado)\t8\t36,36\nAdze (enx\u00f3)\t3\t13,63\nUndetermined\t8\t36,36\nChisel (form\u00e3o)\t1\t4,55\nHammer (martelo)\t2\t9,10\nTotal\t22\t100\nTab. 3. Polished stone (CPE 2012-2014, Area 1). Portuguese names for the tools in italics.\nThe number of polished stone artefacts found at CPE is relatively small, with a total of 22 artefacts being collected between 2012 and 2014 (table 3). We may consider that these artefacts would have had a prolonged useful life and that some of their tasks might have been performed by unworked knapped stone such as hammerstones. However, this panorama is similar to what happened in other settlements in southern Portugal, namely in the Alentejo and the Algarve. No petrographical characterisation was undertaken of the polished stones at CPE, although macroscopically we may consider such stones as amphibole schists (Cardoso et al. 1995, 149) and some adzes of altered philonian basalt. The catchment area of the amphibolic rocks might be regional (5 to 50km) in Montargil or Avis, or supra-regional in the Alto Alentejo, but a reliable classification can only be made with petrographical analyses. A study was undertaken of the region of the \u2018Alto Ribatejo\u2019 (Pereira 2012), with petrographical tests being conducted on polished stone originating from local settlements (Casal dos Cucos,\nCabe\u00e7o do C\u00e3o, Cova dos Castanheiros, Fonte Santa II, Agroal, Rexaldia) and from two necropolises located in Torres Novas (Lapa da Bugalheira and Necr\u00f3pole das Lapas). After comparing these data with the supply sources mentioned by J. L. Cardoso, it can be seen that this material was most probably obtained in more distant areas, at Arronches and \u00c9vora (Cardoso et al. 1995). Although the study is still in its preliminary stages, these data seem to confirm that the resources cannot be interpreted only through a cartographical reading.\n4.2.3.\tKnapped stone\n\tN\u00b0\t%\nGrinding slabs (dormente)\t104\t21,86\nGrinder (movente)\t46\t9,66\nUndetermined grinding stone (pedra afei\u00e7oada, dormente ou movente).\t146\t30,67\nHandstone (percutor)\t162\t34,03\nPolisher (polidor)\t12\t2,52\nAnvil (bigorna)\t5\t1,05\nCover (tampa)\t1\t0,21\nTotal\t476\t100\nTab. 4. Grinding stones (CPE 2012-2014, Area 1). Portuguese names for the tools in italics.\na)\tGrinding elements\nThe grinding elements found, both dormant and moving, are highly fragmented amounting in total to 476 records (table 4). However, only nine dormant and six moving elements were found entirely intact, with most of the finds corresponding to indeterminate fragments (26.8%), which did not make it possible to classify the type of tool used with any degree of certainty. Several fragmented grinding stones were collected in situ, which it proved possible to reassemble. Currently 122 indeterminate fragments are still being reassembled. This is a fairly complex task, since many of the fractures are extremely brittle. The state of fragmentation of the moving and dormant elements reflects two quite distinct situations: the depositional conditions and the respective use. The acid soils at CPE not only affected the organic matter, but also the inorganic materials with lower levels of compactness namely ceramics, the stones used\nto build the huts and the grinding stones. On the other hand, those elements that were found complete or in a state which made it possible to classify them, revealed an intensive state of use expressed in their polishing and in the presence of several active surfaces, although their wear index is low (see the criteria in Gon\u00e7alves 1989). A macroscopic observation was made of the complete grinding stones and two possible supply sources were identified: gneissic granite at Furadouro and Montar-gil and pink coarse-grained granite at Brotas and Mora. In both cases, the supply source was situated over 10km away (fig. 10).\nb)\tHammerstones\nThe hammerstones found at CPE are mostly quartzite (92%), with a scant presence of quartz (8%) (fig. 6). The morphological diversity of the hammerstones indicates a variety of functions, with the presence being noted of elongated, spheroid and polyhedral examples, arrises and indeterminate fragments. Used on local resources, many examples present tenuous signs of wear. They are unipolar or bipolar and in some cases the percussion marks are peripheral.\nGiven the non-specialised nature of these artefacts few functional studies have been carried out. For the hammerstones found at the settlements of the upper eastern Algarve, Victor S. Gon\u00e7alves acknowledges that they may have been used for recuperation of the surfaces of dormant and moving elements, as well as for crushing copper ore (Gon\u00e7alves 1989). Manuel Calado also mentions the possibility of axes, as well as wedges, being used for percussion purposes (Calado 2001). At CPE, there was a concentration of hammerstones in specific contexts namely in the ditches of the activity area (U.E. 41 with 34 hammerstones and U.E. 39 with 21 hammerstones), expressing possible functional areas.\nc)\tPolishers\nFig. 8.\tAbove: detail from the arrowhead F.17-19; Below: flake C.17-48, face and reverse of the arrowhead\nF.17-19, preform from an arrowhead (D.E 5/6-2).\nFig. 9.

Beads. Portuguese name for the artefacts in italics.\nThe group of artefacts used for personal adornment consists exclusively of necklace beads made of green stone, which were identified both in Phase 2 and Phase 3 (see table 5). Carlos Odriozola undertook recently some non-destructive analyses with X-ray fluorescence, having classified the material used in the manufacture of the whole group as variscite. The presence of a significant group of variscite beads is once again linked to the region of the Portuguese Estremadura. There they were found in abundance (Odriozola et al. 2013a; 2013b), contrasting with the contexts of the Alentejo where they are usually scarcer, except for special cases such as Perdig\u00f5es, where the group that was found amounts to 3,000 examples (Odriozola et al. 2012). The only known supply sources are in Huelva, at Pico Centeno and in Zamora, at Palazuelo de las Cuevas (Odriozola et al. 2010), but it is quite probable that there were closer sources as Huet Bacelar Gon\u00e7alves suggests. It therefore seems clear that even small settlements, such as CPE, were integrated into the networks for the circulation of exceptional objects, such as variscite.\n4.2.5\tCeramics\nCeramic items are usually the most abundant artefacts found at Neolithic and Chalcolithic sites. Besides the many ceramic vessels found at CPE, there was a significant number of fragments of cheese strainers and loom weights (table 6). Attention should be drawn to the presence of a large number of pots that were fully intact or that presented a complete profile. This circumstance is related with the stratigraphic preservation conditions, without any disturbances after deposition and with two clear contexts of rapid abandonment and preservation under the debris: Kitchen H.14-15 (13 pots\n\tN\u00b0\t%\nSherds and vessels (cer\u00e2micas, bordos e vasos lisos)\t3561\t92\nDecorated ceramic vessels (cer\u00e2mica decorada)\t147\t4\nCheese strainers (queijeiras)\t73\t2\nCeramic looms (pesos de tear)\t93\t2\nTotal\t3874\t100\nTab. 6.

There was a predominance of smooth ceramics with the presence of the morphological catalogue that commonly appears in domestic contexts from the 3rd mill. BCE (see Gon\u00e7alves, 1989; Soares/Silva 1976/1977), as well as the simple forms:\n1.\tdishes with thickened and non-thickened rims\n2.\tbowls\n3.\tdome-shaped bowls\n4.\tspherical bowls\n5.\tpots and rare composite forms\n6.\ttruncated cones\nThe keel-like shapes usually associated with the Late Neolithic are absent here, with the group of pieces as a whole displaying an exclusively Chalcolithic chronology. The importance of the dishes and bowls and the absence of shapes such as bowls with a turned-out rim, shows a clear southern influence, but the presence of a significant group of ceramics decorated with acacia leaves (84 records) reflects the importance of the Portuguese Estremaduran influences at CPE. The concept of the \u2018Acacia Leaf Group\u2019 (Gon\u00e7alves/ Sousa 2006) includes the decorations that were stamped and engraved with carved leaves, wide fluting and geometrical decoration (triangles and lozenges). There are residual traces of other decorative types, such as \u2018combed ceramics\u2019, an influence from the Lisbon Peninsula and symbolic ceramics, which were present in the whole of the southern Iberian Peninsula during the 3rd mill. The bell-shaped ceramics present at the site of Barranco do Farinheiro roughly 3km away are absent here, once again showing that their spread was not uniform, although this fact per se cannot\nbe regarded as constituting a reliable indicator of periodisation.\nThere is also a crossover of influences to be noted in the loom weights: 21 plate weights of the Estremaduran type (one of which is decorated) and 72 crescent weights of the Alentejo type.\nAlthough systematic studies of cheese strainers are rare, we can consider that the high number of fragments found at CPE is closer to the Estremadu-ran reality than that of the Alentejo, where such finds are usually residual.\nThe clay used for the production of these artefacts, pots and \u2018industrial\u2019 ceramics might have been collected close to CPE, although the Geological Map does not show any occurrences of clay in the arenitic substratum. Roughly 20km away areas of clay have been mapped at Montargil to the east of CPE. Archaeometric studies analysing the provenance of clays for prehistoric Peninsular contexts are rare, but the case studies that are available show that extraction from a nearby local place was a recurrent phenomenon at distances of less than five kilometres (In\u00e1cio 2015). The case of Valencina de la Concepci\u00f3n with clay that was collected 12km away (In\u00e1cio 2015) constitutes an exception in a context of great interpretive complexity.\n4.2.6.

Copper. Portuguese names for the objects in italics.\nThe number of copper tools recovered at CPE is small (table 7), amounting to no more than eight and corresponding to small-sized artefacts, essentially entire and fragmented awls. Nonetheless, the presence of metallurgy is to be noted throughout the site, mainly in the form of remains of metallurgical operations: copper nodules, an ingot, slag, fragment and ceramic vessels used for smelting. The small amount of copper tools may mean that\nthe copper was reused, contrasting with the neighbouring site of Barranco do Farinheiro, where an entire axe was found weighing roughly 500g.\nMost of the artefacts related with metallurgy are associated with Phase 3 (93%), only appearing residually in Phase 2 (7%). Particularly relevant is the presence of a combustion area with smelting slag and miniscule particles of copper by the side of Hut 7.\nAlthough there is a reduced number of ceramics with slag stuck to them, no crucibles of the common southern type (with a rectangular mouth), such as known from the settlements of And\u00e9valo, Huelva and the Upper Eastern Algarve. Nor are there any other crucibles with feet, such as found in the Portuguese Estremadura (fig. 12).\nRegardless of the size of the group of metallic materials found in most settlements of the 3rd mill. with copper, we can still note the presence of metallurgical production (Kunst 2013), which in some way contradicts the suggestion of specialisation and elites (Nocete 2004).\n4.3.\tBiotic Resources: Direct and Indirect Evidence\nThe reconstitution of subsistence biotic resources is very difficult, in view of the extremely poor state of preservation of organic matter found at the archaeological sites on the left bank of the Tagus River.\n4.3.1.\tHunting and Fishing\nAs far as hunting is concerned, the information that is currently available for the Estremadura and the Alentejo during the 3rd mill. seems to point to very distinct patterns of relative importance in relation to archaeozoological finds (Davis/Moreno Garcia 2007; Davis/Mataloto 2012; Valente/Carval-ho 2014).\nFig. 12. Copper metallurgy. On top: ingot C.16-84, crucible V.15-8 with melted copper traces; Below: awl (B.14-1), awl with organic handle and detail (C.13-168).\nGarc\u00eda 2013) would seem to indicate the importance of hunting with a distinct model of economic exploitation and with great variability (Valente/ Carvalho 2014).\nFor the Ribatejo, in the area where CPE is situated, the acidity of the soil does not allow us to determine the relative importance of hunting, although the high percentage of arrowheads (60% of tools) may reflect the importance of hunting in this region. The presence of an aurochs deposited in the ditch at CPE is evidence of the practice of hunting.\nAs the site is located between the Ribeira da Erra and the Sorraia River, water resources certainly played an important role in the subsistence strategy of these communities, but there is an absence of artefactual indicators, namely the weights of fishing nets which are present in sites close to the Guadiana River, such as Porto das Carretas and Sala n\u00b0 1. Perhaps these remained close to the course of the river, but the truth is that we do not know.\n4.3.2.\tProduction\nLittle is known about the production methods of the ancient peasants of the Sorraia valley.\nThe alluvial soils around CPE were certainly extensively used for agricultural purposes, but there is currently little evidence of agriculture. In the future a palynological study may be carried out like the one that was undertaken for the Sizan-dro valley (Dambeck et al. 2015) in order to assess the impact of agriculture in the Sorraia Valley. The presence of grinding elements and their intensive use may also be an indication of cereal farming.\nIn the case of pastoral farming, there are some direct indicators, with the occasional presence of sheep and goat bones. The presence of a significant group of cheese strainers (73 fragments collected between 2012 and 2014 one of which is \u2018complete\u2019) seems to indicate the secondary use of animal resources at CPE.\nThe analysis of ceramic residues is a very important tool for identifying milk consumption, even though the laboratory work has been a lengthy process with successive attempts being made in the last 30 years. The difficulties of this type of analysis\nare recurrently mentioned by the different teams that have carried out these studies: although fresh milk contains large amounts of fatty acids (C4:0 a C12:0), it is difficult for these components to survive in ceramic ware because they are susceptible to hydrolysis and are soluble in water (Copley et al. 2003, 1524). It was therefore necessary to find other biochemical indicators based on the different classes of fats (Vigne/Helmer 2007, 13).\nDespite the extensive research that has been undertaken into this subject there is a shortage of analyses of contents on the Iberian Peninsula and analyses of perforated ceramics usually classified as cheese strainers have in fact never been undertaken before. However, the group of such artefacts found at CPE is currently under study, which may be an important contribution in this direction (Gon\u00e7alves et al. in print).\nIn the south of Portugal, despite the lack of published contexts, we can state that cheese strainers were found in practically all domestic contexts. There is also an intensification of their presence to be noted during the 3rd mill. with a further increase in the Full Chalcolithic period at sites such as Penedo do Lexim (Sousa 2010) and Liceia (Cardoso 2006). This tendency was also noted at CPE where they mainly appeared in Phase 3, including a possible area of cheese making in the activity area given the name of the \u2018terrace\u2019 and a complete cheese strainer found in Hut 7.\n5.\tNear and Far - the Territories for the\nExploitation of Resources Used at CPE\nIn order to reconstitute the territories for the exploitation of the resources that were used at CPE we sought to compare the quantitative analysis of the archaeological finds mentioned earlier with the reading of the surrounding territory.\nThe reading of the territory was undertaken through geological cartography (scale: 1:50,000) and surface field surveys designed to characterise the main landscape units of the territory surrounding CPE, in a systematic fashion in the immediate environment (within a radius of roughly five kilometres) and on an ad-hoc basis at a regional level (between five and thirty kilometres), selecting areas with a potential for the exploitation of resources.\nSamples were collected for macroscopic comparison with the groups of artefacts found at CPE.\nThe study of the supply of resources at a su-praregional level would require greater analytical support with general readings being made from baseline studies.\nLocal Collection (&lt;5km)\nA preliminary analysis showed that the resources related with the construction of domestic structures (wood, sandstone, clay) could be obtained in the site\u2019s immediate surroundings.\nIn the Quaternary terraces situated upstream from CPE it was possible to obtain quartz and quartzite, which were used for the expedient manufacture of artefacts, playing a secondary role within the general context of the supply of lithic raw materials.\nOccasionally, the Sorraia River might have brought materials from more distant areas to the site. In fieldworks, fragments of schist, lyddite, micaschist and even granite were found, small-sized and in a secondary position. Although there were no visible signs of areas used for the quarrying of clay, attention is drawn to the profound changes that this territory underwent after the beginning of the Flandrian Transgression. The gentle topography and the abundance of water resources probably favoured agriculture, a vocation that has continued to be practised here until the present day. Similarly, the estuary marshland context located in the adjoining area would certainly have been favourable for hunting and the consequent exploitation of the region\u2019s land and water resources.\nGiven the existence of other settlements in the resource catchment area close to CPE less than five kilometres away, we will have to consider the possibility of a sharing of resources. Particularly relevant here is the case of Barranco do Farinheiro, three kilometres from CPE and dated by radiocarbon as being from the same chronological period. Other small sites existed in the area immediately surrounding CPE, as confirmed in the case of Ca-tarroeira. The question of a sharing of resources may stimulate different theoretical models, as was proposed in the case of the settlement of And\u00e9valo (Huelva), with a possible local supply of resources being shared by various communities (In\u00e1cio 2015). We may also conceive of a hierarchized\nmodel for the settlement of the Sorraia Valley with central places. The extent of the surface dispersion and the presence of exceptional materials would seem to indicate that Barranco do Farinheiro was a central place in the Sorraia Valley. However, the samples that have been excavated are highly uneven: 536m2 at CPE and 36m2 at Barranco do Farinheiro.\nRegional Collection (5-30km)\nMost of the lithic resources could have been obtained at a regional level, at distances of roughly 20km. Three possible areas of exploitation were identified: (1) Montargil, on the left bank of the River Sor; (2) Furadouro, on the right bank of the Ribeira do Raia and (3) Mora/Brotas, on the edge of the old massif of the Alentejo. In Montargil, gneis-sic granite, micaschist, amphibolite, clay, siliceous schist, lyddite and quartz would have been available, granite and clay in Furadouro and Brotas. In a macroscopic analysis of the granite that was found it was possible to identify gneissic granite originating from Montargil and pink granite originating from Mora. We also know that several territories were very likely exploited. Most of the supplies of lithic materials would have been found in the regional territory: schist, jaspoid schist, lyddite and amphibolite. Knapping was mainly carried out on raw materials of local and regional origin. It is rare to find settlements in the territories where resources were probably exploited (Montargil, Furadouro and Brotas), but little archaeological research has been undertaken in these regions and what has been done has been directed towards specific themes. In the area of Furadouro and Brotas/Mora, archaeological finds have been dominated by the presence of megalithic monuments, but it is not known where the contemporary settlements in the region were located: \u2018many dolmens, few people?\u2019 It does not seem possible to defend the proposal that the inhabitants of CPE used these necropolises in view of their distance and above all due to the fact that these tombs were possibly much older. It is more likely that there were negative, hidden tombs, as in the case of the monument of Quinta Grande or Monte da Barca (Gon\u00e7alves 2011), an enigmatic funereal occurrence that was identified in the meadowland of the Sorraia Valley some decades ago.\nGiven the positioning of the settlement close to the Sorraia River, it is plausible that the essential reason for establishing communities at CPE was not its direct location next to the sources of the raw materials most commonly used for toolmaking and that there were other reasons for this, linked to the soil\u2019s capacities for use in agricultural and pastoral activities and, above all, to the control of areas of passage.\nExtraregional Collection (more than 30km)\nRaw materials that were clearly of an extraregional origin were found in relatively small numbers at the CPE archaeological site. While the local and regional collection of raw materials can be understood as a direct activity of the communities that lived at CPE and in the surrounding territory, the presence of materials with clearly extraregional origin would seem to indicate supracommunity interactions that implied a vast network of paths and relations with various territories. CPE and the whole of the Sorraia valley seem to have lain on the fringes of all the important supraregional resources that comprise the archaeological record of the 3rd mill.: flint, amphibolite and copper. Flint was one of the most significant extraregional resources found at CPE. Although it had only a minority share among the flaked stone of CPE (roughly 15%), it was used for specific tools such as blades and awls. In view of the geological substratum of the Estremadura, with cretaceous and Jurassic formations where there is an abundance of flint it is unquestionable that the flint at CPE would have come from the Estremadura. The quantity, accessibility, variety and quality of flint in the Estremadura is unparalleled in present-day Portuguese territory (Forenbaher 1999, 31). In a macroscopic observation of the material found at CPE, we can identify possible areas of supply: Rio Maior, Caxarias and the Lisbon Peninsula. This identification is based on a comparison between the mineralogical characteristics of the archaeological samples from CPE and those of the geological samples collected in these areas (iron oxides, microquartz and chalcedony). In recent decades, our knowledge about the collection of flint during the 4th and 3rd mill. has advanced quite considerably with the excavation of contexts that specialised in knapping and the geo-archaeological study of some groups of finds.\nGenerally speaking we can identify three main categories of contexts specialising in knapping in the Estremadura: mines, lithic workshops and mixed contexts. As far as mines are concerned there is a scarcity of subterranean contexts, of which the only one that is known is Campolide in Lisbon (Choffat 1907). At Casal Barril, Mafra (Sousa/Gon\u00e7alves 2011). There a mine context (or one from the primary phase of extraction in a semi-subterranean ditch) was detected dating from the first half of the 3rd mill. in the early Chalcolithic period (Beta-260629; Beta-260628: 28602470 calBC at 2 sigmas). Attention is also drawn to the importance of the surface mining of flint corresponding to nodules of flint in a secondary position in detrital or alluvial deposits: Pedreira do Aires, Monte das Pedras, Casal dos Matos (An-drade/Matias 2013). The lithic workshops, which resulted from a continuous and repeated activity of lithic production (P\u00e9legrin 1995, 159), were essentially situated in the area of Rio Maior, where various workshops that specialised in foliaceous products were identified and excavated, namely at Olival do Passal (Zilh\u00e3o 1995), Casas de Baixo (Zilh\u00e3o 1994; Forenbaher 1999) and Cabe\u00e7o dos Mouros (Andrade 2014). No workshops have yet been identified for the production of large blades in the Estremadura. Everything points to the fact that during the 3rd mill. BCE the circulation of flint outside the Estremadura region was centred on large \u2018prestigious\u2019 pieces - large blades and halberds, as is shown by the archaeological record of the megalithic monuments of the Alentejo. The \u2018amortisation\u2019 of flint, necessary for the circulation of large bifacial pointed blades (halberds, dart points) was very high, since these could be as much as 30cm in length and 500g in weight. This is the case with a piece found at Cabecinha (Figueira da Foz) which weighs 520g. In Coruche, there is a significant presence of flint daggers at the tomb of Quinta Grande or Monte da Barca, but this type of artefact is completely absent from the settlements excavated in the region. An identical situation arises in other contexts of the Alentejo, namely at Reguengos de Monsaraz, where flint is scarce in settlements such as Monte Novo dos Albardeiros or Torre do Espor\u00e3o 3 appearing in exceptional large-scale pieces in the votive remains found at the tholos of Olival da Pega 2b.\nWhen we compare the economics of the supply of lithic materials from the settlements in central and southern Portugal, we can see that there was a clear \u2018environmental determinism\u2019. In contexts that were distant from the natural presence of flint, such as the Ribatejo or the Alentejo, flint is a minority element, as is shown by Cabe\u00e7o do P\u00e9 da Erra on the one hand, or sites such as Porto das Carretas on the other hand. In contrast to this in the Estremadura area flint was a predominant feature of all settlements. The lesser aptitude of the local rocks was outweighed by the ease with which they could be obtained and replaced.\nThis reality was further accentuated in the 3rd mill. when there seems to have been a trend towards the intensive exploitation of local and regional resources in detriment to extra-regional resources. When we undertake a retrospective reading for the territory of the Sorraia River, we can see that the strategy of collecting lithic resources is substantially different at the Cardial Early Neolithic site of Casas Novas situated just one kilometre away from CPE on the Quaternary terraces surrounding the Sorraia River. Here flint is the predominant material with a share of 72% of the group of archaeological finds. The sources for the supply of flint also seem to be slightly different, since at Casas Novas there was a predominance of materials originating from the area of Tomar and Rio Maior, whereas at CPE there seems to have existed a greater variety of supply sources.\nAs far as the hard rocks used for the production of polished stone artefacts are concerned, the situation is substantially more complex, since no areas of direct exploitation (quarries) were detected. This lacuna is common to most of the Iberian Peninsula, possibly expressing a deficiency in the research that has been undertaken in this area or the sparse nature of actual quarrying for hard rocks. J. L. Cardoso presents a proposal for the location of amphibolitic rocks: \u2018the border of the Cenozoic basin of the River Tagus\u2019 (Cardoso 1999/2000, 267). He identifies several \u2018potential sources\u2019 (Abrantes, Ponte de S\u00f4r, Montargil, Avis, Montemor-o-Novo, south of Gr\u00e2ndola). We could also add to these sources El-vas in the Alto Alentejo. It might also be possible to consider the collection of such rocks at secondary deposits, as happens in the area of the Ribeira da Seda. Comparing these potential sources with the\npositioning of CPE we could suggest that the amphibolitic rocks were collected in the area of Montar-gil/Abrantes, but it will be necessary to undertake petrographical analyses since they might have an extraregional origin, as shown by the analyses undertaken by J\u00falio Pereira (Pereira 2012) for samples from the Alto Ribatejo region. Attention should also be drawn to the fact that no documentary record has been made of a significant presence of the manufacture of polished stone tools, a situation that is similarly found in other contexts such as Porto das Carretas (Soares 2013) or S\u00e3o Pedro (personal information provided by Rui Mataloto). This situation is in direct contrast to that of the Beiras, where there is a considerable group of artefacts from the operational chain: preparatory material (blocks and blanks) and remains (flakes, blades and revival plates and edges) present in large numbers at Castro de Santiago and Malhada (Valera 2007, 384).\nSeveral authors have mentioned the question of the strategic value of polished stone for peasant communities in the 3rd mill. with hard rocks constituting a necessary material in daily life. However, in many contexts such as CPE polished stone is relatively scarce. This situation is common to many contexts in the Alentejo and the Algarve, where the number of examples found is small, as for example at Porto das Carretas (38 examples, Soares 2013, 175), Julioa 4 (12 examples, Valera 2013b, 272), Luz 20 (17 examples, Valera 2013b, 272), Moinho Valadares (15 examples, Valera 2013b, 272), Mercador (13 examples, Valera 2013b, 272), Sala n\u00b0 1 (21 examples in the excavated area) and Cerro do Castelo de Santa Justa (16 examples, Gon\u00e7alves 1989). The site of S\u00e3o Pedro seems to be an exception with a group of more than a hundred examples.1 Besides the question of sampling methodology dealing with sometimes large numbers of unquantified surface examples, there may also be a different dynamic in the management of this resource. In contrast to this situation, we find the settlements of the Estremadura with a high presence of amphibolite tools at the fortified settlements, amounting to several hundred per site: 375 examples at Castro do Zambujal, 206 at Pragan\u00e7a and 97 at Pedra d\u2019Ouro (Lillios 1997, 154). At Liceia, besides the 180 examples collected at the excavations undertaken by Jo\u00e3o Lu\u00eds Cardo\n1\tPersonal information provided by Rui Mataloto.\nso, there were 400 examples originating from surface collections (Cardoso 1999/2000). An identical situation was found at Penedo do Lexim with 48 examples collected at the excavations and an indeterminate number of examples originating from surface collections (Sousa 2010). It does not seem possible to defend the application of a model of an amphibolite market and an exhaustion of stocks in the late Chalcolithic period as K. Lillios suggested (1997), but there is a greater concentration of amphibolite in areas lying outside the possible areas of supply. In this case CPE fits more easily into the pattern that was found in the Alentejo, possibly with a less controlled management of a resource that was abundant at the regional level.\nWe also have a considerable shortage of information for the case of copper metallurgy. The Iberian Pyrite Belt, from Cercal to Huelva, is the obvious source for the supply of copper (Cardoso/ Guerra 1997/1998, 74), with a group of mines having been identified that may have been exploited in the Chalcolithic period or in the Bronze Age (M\u00fcller et al. 2007). According to the chemical and isotopic analysis undertaken of the groups of artefacts from Liceia, Vila Nova de S\u00e3o Pedro and La Pijotilla, there was a similarity in terms of the presence of lead with the ore from the belt of Ossa Morena indicating that the sources of supply would have been common to both regions (M\u00fcller/Cardo-so 2008, 84). But the reading based on the isotopic analyses of lead must however, be considered with some care, because the documentary base is very small. Cabe\u00e7o do P\u00e9 da Erra presents a record of metallurgical practices especially in Phase 3 of its occupation, which corresponds to the third quarter of the 3rd mill. Just as happened in the Estremadura at Liceia or Penedo do Lexim metallurgy appeared later than it did in the areas closer to the pyrite belt.\n6.\tBetween Land and Sea - the Paths and the Cultural Traditions in the Sorraia Valley\nThe probable trading networks that existed towards the end of the 4th mill. and the beginning of the 3rd mill. also express social and symbolic choices so that we cannot conceive of trading mechanisms from a strictly economic point of\nview. For CPE and the Sorraia Valley, this circumstance is of special importance since it is situated in an area of passage at the point of transition between worlds with a clearly marked cultural identity: the Portuguese Estremadura and the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula. It is difficult to gauge which of the regions exercised more influence in these communities. As far as the sacred aspect is concerned CPE generally shows evidence of the presence of the various components of the magical and religious complex of the 3rd mill. that was characteristic for the south of the Iberian Peninsula: schist plaques with geometrical decoration and small clay statuettes of female figures. The presence of areas used for the production of schist plaques together with the various stages of the operational chain that were found here, is one of the specific features of the first occupation of CPE with similar contexts in the Alentejo being practically unknown except at \u00c1guas Frias in Alandroal. The presence of small ceramic statuettes has no evident parallel in Andalusia (Nocete 2004) and they are almost completely absent in the archaeological record of the Estremadura. Other components such as symbolic ceramics and horned idols appear throughout the Iberian Peninsula in the 3rd mill. The ceramic repertoire that expresses the everyday activities in the life of these communities records a dual influence: the catalogue of forms is similar to that of the Alentejo, but the influence of the Estremadura can be felt in the presence of a significant group of ceramics from the acacia leaf category. The concept of the Acacia leaf group (Gon\u00e7alves/Sousa 2006) must be understood here in its broadest sense, bringing together a decorative diversity and a range of morphologies: vessels with oval impressions, with herringbone patterns and decorated in lines, with deep, wide fluting, in simple association or in composite patterns. Pots, dishes and spherical bowls are practically absent from the necropolises and are preferentially associated with fortified settlements, although the acacia leaf group appears at some open sites. The region denoting the use and circulation of ceramics from the Acacia leaf group is an area centred on the Lisbon and Set\u00fabal peninsulas, with small occurrences in the Alentejo. The duality of influences is also to be found in other areas, such as for example in the technology that was developed\nin weaving with the presence of the crescent loom weights that were typical of the Alentejo, as well as the robust, parallelepiped or square loom weights of the Estremadura.\nSituated amid the shadows of the great River Tagus which crosses over the Iberian Peninsula CPE in the 3rd mill. showed the dynamics of a small farm, centred upon crop growing and grazing, but integrated into broader networks for the exchange of goods and ideas.\nVictor S.
