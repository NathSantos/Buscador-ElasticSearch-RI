The distinctive impacts of urbanization include the increase in \n\nimpervious surfaces which in turn alters the hydrology and geomorphology of \n\nstreams. Thus, urbanization affects not only water quality but also habitat \n\ncharacteristics. Biological indicators may reveal spatial-temporal effects of \n\nstressors and their cumulative effects on stream biota and biotic indices based \n\non intolerance to disturbance and taxonomic richness are effective and widely \n\nused to assess ecological health. However, the multiple, co-occurring and \n\ninteracting stressors of urban streams, namely habitat alterations, may be better \n\nrevealed by macroinvertebrate traits - the species adaptations to environmental \n\nconditions. The aim of this study is to compare traditional quality assessment \n\napproaches related to macroinvertebrate community structure and widely used \n\nbiotic indices with information provided by the study of aquatic \n\nmacroinvertebrate traits in order to establish the ability of species traits to \n\nassess ecological integrity of urban streams. The results obtained during four \n\nsampling occasions at four sites in Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, a small peri-urban \n\nstream in Coimbra revealed more temporal than spatial variability. The \n\ncombination of five traits related to macroinvertebrate biological (duration of the \n\nlife cycle, resistance form and feeding method), physiological (respiration form) \n\nand ecological (locomotion and relationship to the substrate) adaptations was \n\nable to separate sampling dates whose environmental variables were distinct \n\nbut not sites.

Os efeitos mais distintivos da urbaniza\u00e7\u00e3o incluem o aumento \n\nde superf\u00edcies imperme\u00e1veis que por sua vez alteram a hidrologia e a \n\ngeomorfologia dos rios, afectando n\u00e3o s\u00f3 a qualidade da \u00e1gua mas tamb\u00e9m as \n\ncaracter\u00edsticas do habitat. Os indicadores biol\u00f3gicos podem revelar os efeitos \n\nesp\u00e1cio-temporais das press\u00f5es exercidas sobre o ecossistema mas tamb\u00e9m \n\nos seus efeitos cumulativos sobre as comunidades bi\u00f3ticas. \u00cdndices bi\u00f3ticos \n\nbaseados na intoler\u00e2ncia \u00e0 perturba\u00e7\u00e3o e na riqueza taxon\u00f3mica s\u00e3o eficazes e \n\namplamente utilizados para avaliar a qualidade ambiental. No entanto, a \n\nmultiplicidade de press\u00f5es co-ocorrendo e interagindo nos rios urbanos, \n\nnomeadamente altera\u00e7\u00f5es de habitat, poder\u00e3o ser melhor reveladas \n\nrecorrendo a traits de macroinvertebrados \u2013 adapta\u00e7\u00f5es das esp\u00e9cies \u00e0s \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais. O objectivo deste estudo \u00e9 comparar as abordagens \n\ntradicionais de avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de qualidade, relacionadas com a estrutura da \n\ncomunidade de macroinvertebrados e \u00edndices bi\u00f3ticos correntemente utilizados, \n\ncom informa\u00e7\u00f5es obtidas pelo estudo de traits de macroinvertebrados \n\naqu\u00e1ticos, a fim de estabelecer a capacidade da sua utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o para avaliar a \n\nintegridade ecol\u00f3gica dos rios urbanos. Os resultados obtidos durante quatro \n\namostragens em quatro locais da Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, um pequeno rio peri-\n\nurbano de Coimbra, revelaram existir maior variabilidade temporal que \n\nespacial. A combina\u00e7\u00e3o de cinco traits biol\u00f3gicos (dura\u00e7\u00e3o do ciclo de vida, \n\nforma de resist\u00eancia e modo de alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o), fisiol\u00f3gicos (modo de respira\u00e7\u00e3o) \n\ne ecol\u00f3gicos (locomo\u00e7\u00e3o em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao substrato) permitiu separar datas de \n\namostragem cujas vari\u00e1veis ambientais foram distintas mas n\u00e3o locais. \n\nConcluindo, o uso de traits permite distinguir amostras associadas a \n\ncaracter\u00edsticas ambientais distintas. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: rios urbanos; qualidade ambiental; macroinvertebrados; \ntraits; Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es.\n\nVII \n \n\n\n\n  \n\nIndex \n \n\n1.

Importance and Functioning of Flowing Waters \n\nFresh water is a finite natural resource that can only be replenished through \n\nthe hydrological cycle in which water from seas, lakes, forests, land, rivers, and \n\nreservoirs evaporates, forms clouds, and returns as precipitation (Corval\u00e1n et \n\nal., 2005). Fresh water represents only 0.01% of the world\u2019s water but it holds \n\napproximately 6% of all described species; and the biodiversity decline rates of \n\nfreshwaters are among the most concerning (Dudgeon et al., 2005). Discharge \n\nof toxic chemicals, over-pumping of aquifers and long-range atmospheric \n\ntransport of pollutants are the major causes for water quality degradation \n\n(Bartram et al., 1996). While water quality is diminishing the world\u2019s population \n\nincreases, further increasing water demands for irrigation, drinking, household \n\nuses and industrial production (Rosegrant et al., 2005). Furthermore, water \n\nresources are not evenly distributed around the globe intensifying competition \n\nfor water (Watkins et al., 2006). \n\nPristine rivers shaped the development of ancient civilizations. Cities \n\nemerged in the fertile areas downstream where agricultural resources were \n\nensured and transport costs were lowest (Algaze, 2008). Nowadays, running \n\nwaters are shaped by human needs and subjected in a world-wide scale by a \n\nvariety of water-management practices, overexploitation, flow modification, \n\ndestruction or degradation of habitat and invasion of exotic species (Dudgeon et \n\nal., 2005), all of which affects stream ecosystems.  \n\nStream ecosystems are complex and, from source to mouth, a gradient of \n\nmorphological and physical conditions shape the dominant processes and the \n\nbiotic communities (Vannote et al., 1980). Low order streams are narrow and \n\nshaded by the surrounding riparian canopy, limiting primary production in water. \n\nRiparian vegetation plays an important role structuring the ecosystem as it \n\nheavily contributes to the energy flux when primary production is insufficient \n\n(Allan 1995, Imberge et al., 2008). The communities on those headwater \n\n9 \n \n\n\n\n  \n\nstreams rely on materials coming from outside the channel, such as leaves and \n\ntwigs (CPOM \u2013 coarse particulate organic matter), as the main energy source. \n\nShredding invertebrate detritivores, by breaking leaves into smaller pieces will \n\nconvert CPOM into smaller particles - fine particulate organic matter (FPOM), \n\nwhich is used downstream as food by other organisms, the collectors and the \n\nfilterers. When moving downstream the stream channel widens reducing \n\nshading from riparian canopy, increasing the amount of incident sunlight and \n\nallowing for more primary production and thus more phytoplankton and algae in \n\nwater that serve as food source for scrapers and collectors. Close to the mouth \n\nthe influence of riparian vegetation lowers to a minimum and the \n\nmacroinvertebrate communities are mainly composed of collectors and \n\npredators. (Vannote et al., 1980).   \n\n1.2. Effects of Human Activities on Streams \n\nHuman activities have been causing increasing alterations in surface waters \n\nand the hydrological cycle. Those activities include the alteration of the land \n\ncover of river basins, the regularization of the water fluxes, the construction of \n\ndams for irrigation or other purposes, soil drainage, and groundwater extraction, \n\namong others (Kuchment, 2004).  \n\nRegarding urbanization, the replacement of the natural land cover by the \n\nurban impermeable surfaces results in the most significant alterations, greatly \n\nreducing infiltration and evapotranspiration, and increasing surface runoff \n\n(Kuchment, 2004). The removal of riparian vegetation, the decreased \n\ngroundwater recharge and the \u201cheat island\u201d effect associated with urbanization \n\naffect stream temperature increasing the mean temperature during the summer \n\nwhile decreasing in winter (Pluhowski, 1970), altering stream ecosystem \n\nprocesses such as leaf decomposition (Webster and Benfield, 1986) and \n\ninvertebrate life history (Sweeney, 1984). Depending on the type and extent of \n\nurbanization, the presence of wastewater treatment plants, effluents and/or \n\ncombined sewage overflows, and the extent of storm water drainage, the \n\nchemical effects are less predictable than hydrologic or geomorphic effects \n\n10 \n \n\n\n\n  \n\n(Paul and Meyer, 2001). Therefore, all aspects of the stream aquatic habitat are \n\naltered by urbanization: the \u2018urban stream syndrome\u2019. The urban stream \n\nsyndrome describes the recurrently observed ecological degradation of streams \n\ndraining urban land, including symptoms as a flashier hydrograph, increased \n\ntemperatures, concentration of nutrients (organic and inorganic), contaminants, \n\nand siltation and altered channel morphology (Paul and Meyer, 2001, Meyer et \n\nal., 2005).  \n\nThe responses of the macroinvertebrate communities to these alterations \n\ncan be summarized as follows: (i) decreased biotic richness and diversity in \n\nresponse to contaminants, temperature change, siltation and organic nutrients; \n\n(ii) decreased abundances in response to toxins and siltation and (iii) increased \n\ndominance of tolerant species in response to inorganic and organic nutrients \n\n(Resh and Grodhaus, 1983, Wiederholm, 1984, Paul and Meyer, 2001, Meyer \n\net al., 2005). Leaf breakdown can also be indirectly affected by urbanization \n\nwhen indigenous riparian species are replaced by exotic species that differ in \n\nquality, quantity or even seasonality (Abelho and Gra\u00e7a, 1996, Miller and \n\nBoulton, 2005, Ryder and Miller, 2005). The riparian vegetation assemblage \n\nmay be altered due to various processes such as enrichment of riparian soils \n\n(Riley and Banks, 1996), drying of riparian soils following stream incision \n\n(Groffman et al., 2003) or simply deforestation and replanting. These alterations \n\nin leaf litter may affect the macroinvertebrate community (Abelho and Gra\u00e7a, \n\n1996), especially detritivore shredders, which can have bottom-up effects on the \n\nfood web (Gulis and Suberkropp, 2003, Lepori et al., 2005) especially on low \n\norder streams were shredders are of crucial importance in the energy cycle. \n\nAgriculture effects include altered water chemistry that may result in increased \n\nlevels of nitrates and phosphates (which may lead to eutrophication), increased \n\nconductivity, food web modification with increased Chironomidae densities and \n\ndescreased Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera abundances , biocide leaching and \n\nincreased suspended loads from soil erosion (Welch et al., 1977, Moss, 2008). \n\n \n\n \n11 \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n1.3. Stream Health Assessment  \n\nThe awareness that rivers supporting rich and diverse fauna are valuable \n\nnatural resources led to an increased concern towards stream ecological health \n\nand to the use of ecological indicators for water quality assessment (Abel, 1996, \n\nWenn, 2008). Ecological indicators integrate the condition of resources, the \n\nmagnitude of stresses, and the exposure of biological components to stress, \n\nrelated impacts and consequences (Manoliadis, 2002).  \n\nConventionally, water quality was assessed by measuring chemical \n\nparameters, which are efficient and allow precise measurements of pollutant \n\nconcentrations. However, water quality in flowing waters oscillates rapidly and \n\nchemical analysis may fail to identify peak of pollutant concentrations. Stream \n\nbiota may respond to extremely low levels of pollutants and reflect water quality \n\nover an extended period of time, thus biological methods my reveal information \n\nthat is not accessible via punctual chemical sampling (Abel, 1996, Ziglio et al., \n\n2006).  \n\nTo assess the ecological condition in urban ecosystems, it is vital to define a \n\ntarget condition for management. However, the complexity of restorable \n\nbenchmarks increases where multiple stressors influence ecosystem quality \n\n(Davies and Jackson, 2006), such as in urban streams. In addition, restorable \n\nbenchmarks may also vary along the river continuum where not all sites or river \n\nreaches have the ability to attain a pristine condition. Therefore, a continuum \n\napproach (Carter and Fend, 2005) that sets the realistic minimum condition for \n\necological restoration based on the level of urbanization provides a context for \n\nevaluating both the current condition and the potential for recovery of impacted \n\nwaters. This context can allow for more realistic management targets and \n\nprioritization of sites for restoration and protection (Stoddard et al., 2006). \n\nReference sites are commonly used in bioassessment studies to identify \n\nundisturbed or pristine conditions, as a means of comparison between \n\ndegradation levels and therefore management targets (Hughes, 1995, Prins and \n\nSmith, 2007). However, the continuous urban development often results in the \n\nabsence of reference sites in urban streams (Chessman and Royal, 2004) and \n\n12 \n \n\n\n\n  \n\nit may be thus difficult to define a target condition for restoring urban stream \n\nsites (Meyer et al., 2005).  \n\n1.4. Macroinvertebrates as Assessment Tools \n\nIn 23 October 2000 the European Parliament and the Council established a \n\nframework for community action in the field of water policy named The Water \n\nFramework Directive 2000/60/EC (WFD). This framework overhauls existing \n\npolicies on European water quality management, and establishes the \n\nrequirement for ecological assessment of water quality (Bell and McGillivray, \n\n2006). The purpose is \u2018to prevent further deterioration and to protect and \n\nenhance the status of aquatic ecosystems\u2019 (European Council, 2000). Member \n\nstates must achieve \u2018good ecological and chemical status\u2019 in all surface waters \n\nby 2015, where \u2018good\u2019 is defined with reference to pristine environments.  \n\nMacroinvertebrates are one group that the WFD requires member states to \n\nmonitor. Because macroinvertebrate families are diverse in their pollution \n\nsensitivity, their relative abundance is used to understand the nature, load and \n\nseverity of contamination (MacNeil et al., 2002). As the group is heterogeneous \n\nit is likely that some members respond to pollution. Some members have long \n\nlife histories which allow the observation of temporal changes in communities \n\nand the pollution to which they are responding (Abel, 1996, Ziglio et al., 2006). \n\nFor instance, stoneflies (Plecoptera) are highly sensitive to organic pollution due \n\nto their high oxygen requirements (Mason, 2002), while mayflies \n\n(Ephemeroptera) are sensitive to environmental stress. However, the \n\nephemeropterans Baetidae are reasonably tolerant of nutrient enrichment (Hall \n\nand Lenwood, 2006) and dominate in poorer environmental conditions than \n\nother mayflies. Caddisflies (Trichoptera) are sensitive to environmental stress, \n\nthough some families such as Limnephilidae and Hydropsychidae are relatively \n\ntolerant (Hall and Lenwood, 2006). Chironomidae (Diptera) are widely tolerant \n\nto organic pollution, although Stuijfzand et al. (2000) claim that the success of \n\nthis group is more related to the use of organic food sources, rather than \n\n\u201ctolerance\u201d to pollution. Aquatic worms (Oligochaeta) are extremely tolerant to \n\n13 \n \n\n\n\n  \n\norganic pollution and able to survive anoxic conditions due to the presence of \n\nhemoglobin (Mason, 2002). However, factors such as drift and seasonality may \n\ncamouflage the effects of water quality on the aquatic communities in urban \n\nstreams (Paul and Meyer, 2001, Wenn, 2008). \n\n1.5. Species Traits \n\nTraits are the attributes of species related to physiological, morphological \n\nand life-history adaptive features that are intrinsic to the organism and \n\nconsequently can be measured on the individual level without making reference \n\nto the environment (Violle et al., 2007). Macroinvertebrate adaptations to \n\nenvironmental conditions are characterized by their species traits. \n\nAs trait classifications are not bound to taxonomy (Menezes et al., 2010), \n\ntrait-based assessments are not limited by the spatial-temporal specificity of \n\ntraditional assessment methods. Instead, trait-based approaches rely on the \n\ncommonality of traits instead of species identity (Verberk et al., 2013), offering \n\nadvantages as (i) direct transferability to distant geographic locations, (ii) direct \n\ncomparability of biologically determined quality standards (Statzner et al., 2001, \n\n2008, Horrigan and Baird, 2008), and (iii) enhanced understanding of species-\n\nenvironment relationships (Kearney and Porter, 2009). Because certain traits \n\ninfluence the organism performance they also reflect the ecosystem functioning \n\nand therefore can be used as measures of community functional diversity \n\n(Petchey and Gaston, 2006, McGill et al., 2006).  \n\nTachet (1996) showed that the genus and even the family level are sufficient \n\nto describe the functional diversity (e.g., traits) of lotic invertebrate communities \n\n(Usseglio-Polatera et al., 2000). Species preferences and adaptations \n\ndescribed by their traits can reveal certain effects of urbanization such as \n\nalterations on the river bed or river flow. However, species performance is a \n\ncombination of natural selection and species sorting which do not apply on the \n\nlevel of single traits but on the whole organism carrying multiple traits. \n\nTherefore, is the combination, rather than single traits, that represents the \n\n14 \n \n\n\n\n  \n\nadaptive response to the environment (Stearns, 1976, Grime, 1977, \n\nSouthwood, 1977, Winemiller and Rose, 1992, Verberk et al., 2008). \n\n1.6. Objectives \n\nThe objective of this study is to compare traditional quality assessment \n\napproaches related to macroinvertebrate community structure and widely used \n\nbiotic indices with information provided by the study of aquatic \n\nmacroinvertebrate traits in order to establish the ability of species traits to \n\nassess ecological integrity of urban streams.  \n\n2. Material and Methods \n\n2.1. Study Area \n\nThe study stream was Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, a left tributary of the Mondego \n\nRiver located on the outskirts of Coimbra \u2013 Central Portugal (40\u00b0 12? 41? North, \n\n8\u00b0 25? 45? West). Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es is a 4th order small peri-urban stream \n\ndraining a 7 km2 basin (Pato et al., 2011). Its source is located at an elevation of \n\n177 m, it flows 4.5 km before reaching its mouth at an elevation of 22 meters \n\n(Pato, 2007), conferring a 3.4% gradient. In the last three decades, the area has \n\nbeen exposed to continuous urbanization. In 2001 the catchment area had an \n\nestimated resident population of 7000 inhabitants in an irregular distribution, \n\nwith 25% of the basin urbanized in 2002 (Ferreira, 2008). The basin is covered \n\nby 55.5% forest, 13.0% farmland and 31.5% artificial surfaces (Ferreira et al., \n\n2011).  \n\nThe area is characterized by a humid Mediterranean climate with an \n\naverage annual temperature of +15 \u00baC and with a total rainfall of 980 mm during \n\nan average year, with strong seasonal and inter-annual variability (Ferreira et \n\nal., 2011). During the study period (Table 1) mean daily temperature ranged \n\n15 \n \n\n\n\n  \n\n9.8\u00baC to 20.9\u00baC and total precipitation ranged 0 mm to a maximum of 204.6 mm \n\nduring the heavy precipitation events of December-January. \n\nTable 1.

Sampling Sites \n\nFour different locations along the river longitudinal profile were chosen \n\nbased on easiness of access and on earlier studies (Ribeiro, 2004; Fernandes, \n\n2005; Soares, 2009). The sites were numbered 1 to 4 from source to mouth as \n\nL1, L2, L3 and L4. \n\nThe first sampling site (L1; Figure 1) is located 1605 m from the source, \n\nbelow a hospital center and above a factory. There is a riparian gallery \n\nupstream of the sampling site, composed of shrubs and deciduous trees. The \n\nchannel is relatively natural, with a \u201cv\u201d section, and the substrate is mainly \n\ncomposed of pebbles, gravel and boulders. The second sampling site (L2; \n\nFigure 1) is located 640 m downstream L1. The riparian vegetation is dominated \n\nby small shrubs and herbaceous plants with a few dispersed trees. At the end of \n\nthe summer, the channel was covered by aquatic plants. The stream channel \n\nhas an open \u201cu\u201d section, and above the sampling site there is a bridge which fell \n\ndown during the heavy precipitation events of December. The terrains around \n\nthe site have been profoundly modified due to the construction of roads. The \n\n16 \n \n\n\n\n  \n\nsubstrate is a mixture of fine sediment and gravel, the surrounding area is \n\nagricultural and pastures with nearby habitations. The third sampling site (L3, \n\nFigure 1) is located 493 m downstream L2, has a prairie on the left margin and \n\na dense Mediterranean bush on the right margin which composes a closed \n\nriparian gallery. It is located upstream a small dam, with a wide \u201cu\u201d section and \n\naccumulates fine sand which is the only substrate. The fourth sampling site (L4, \n\nFigure 1) is located 790 m downstream L3, inside ESAC (Escola Superior \n\nAgr\u00e1ria de Coimbra). The construction of roads and pathways led to highly \n\nmodified riparian vegetation that doesn\u2019t exceed one tree in width with the rest \n\nbeing mainly annual shrubs. Upstream there is a small dam and the channel is \n\nmostly artificial. The substrate is composed of pebbles and gravel. The \n\nsurrounding area is mainly for cattle and agricultural uses.  \n\n \nFigure 1. Location, pinpointed in yellow, of the source and the study sites (L1 to L4) \nalong Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es.

Sampling  \n\nThe four study sites were sampled on four occasions (11 September and 12 \n\nNovember 2013, 29 January and 9 April 2014, D1, D2, D3 and D4 respectively). \n\n17 \n \n\n\n\n  \n\nOn each sampling occasion, water temperature, pH, TDS, conductivity and \n\ndissolved oxygen were measured in situ with field instruments (pH 3110 SET 2 \n\nincl. SenTix\u00ae 41, Oxi 3210 SET 1 incl. CellOx\u00ae 325). Water samples were \n\ncollected, transported in an ice-chest, filtered (Whatman\u00ae Glass microfiber \n\nfilters, Grade GF/F) and the water was analyzed to determine orthophosphate \n\n(PO4-P), nitrate (NO3-N) and ammonia (NH4-N) concentrations (Hach\u00ae Lange \n\nDR 3900).  \n\nAfter sampling, channel width was measured on five transects along a reach \n\nof circa 10 m, depth was measured at five points along each transect and \n\nsurface current velocity was determined by measuring the time taken by a \n\nfloating object to travel along the reach. Discharge was calculated as the cross-\n\nsectional area of the portion of the channel times the average current velocity. \n\nThe physicochemical parameters of the study sites ate shown in Table 2.  \n\nBiological sampling was carried out on all habitats using a Surber net \n\n(0.0929 m2, 500 ?m mesh) with the same effort for each replicate with a total of \n\nsix replicate samples per site. Samples were collected from downstream to \n\nupstream at each sampling site, individually allocated to plastic bags, carried \n\nout in an ice-chest and refrigerated (5\u00baC) until processing. In the laboratory the \n\ncontent of each bag was washed through a 500 ?m sieve, placed into a tray and \n\nall macroinvertebrates were collected and preserved in 70% alcohol. \n\nTable 2.

Identification and Trait Classification \n\nIdentification was carried out to the lowest practicable taxonomic level using \n\nthe identification key of Tachet et al. (2000). From the 21 species traits provided \n\nin this book (Appendix Table 1), five traits were selected for the study: three \n\nbiological (life cycle duration, resistance form and feeding), one physiological \n\n(respiration) and one ecological (locomotion-relationship to the substrate). The \n\ntaxa abundances per trait were calculated by summing all organisms that \n\nshared affinity for a certain modality of a trait. When one taxon had the same \n\naffinity for various modalities of a trait, its abundance was evenly distributed \n\namong them.  \n\nThe trait concerning life cycle duration had only two modalities, (i) ? 1 year \n\nand (ii) > 1 year. The trait concerning resistance form had four different \n\nmodalities represented by (i) eggs, gemmules, statoblasts, shells; cocoons; \n\n(ii) diapause or quiescence; and (iii) none, but there was no information for \n\nsome of the taxa. The trait concerning feeding method had six different \n\nmodalities represented by (i) eater of fine sediment; (ii) shredder; (iii) scraper-\n\ngrazer; (iv) filter feeder; (v) piercer; and (vi) predator. The trait concerning \n\nrespiration form had four different modalities represented by (i) tegument; \n\n(ii) gill; (iii) plastron; and (iv) stigmata. Finally, the trait concerning locomotion-\n\nrelationship to the substrate had five different modalities represented by \n\n19 \n \n\n\n\n  \n\n(i) surface swimmer; (ii) swimmer in open water; (iii) crawler; (iv) burrower; and \n\n(v) temporary fixation. \n\nThe community was characterized in terms of density (n\u00ba of individuals m-2), \n\ndiversity (Shannon diversity index and Margalef community index; PRIMER\u00ae \n\nversion 6.1.13) and eveness (Pielou\u2019s evenness index; PRIMER\u00ae version \n\n6.1.13). For quality assessment purposes, %EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera \n\nand Trichoptera) abundance and richness, the biotic indexes IBMWP and ASPT \n\nwere calculated (Alba-Tercedor et al., 2002).  \n\nIBMWP is an adaptation of the original BMWP to the Iberian Peninsula \n\necosystems. The BMWP (Biological Monitoring Working Party) score is an \n\nindex for assessing the river biological quality using macroinvertebrate species \n\non a presence \u2013 absence basis, each family has as a score ranging from 1 \n\n(tolerant) to 10 (intolerant) according to its intolerance to pollution (Alba-\n\nTercedor et al., 2002). The final score is the sum of the scores of all families in \n\nthe sample (Table 3). In order to account for sample size, as larger sample \n\nsizes are likely to include more taxa biasing the results, the Average Score Per \n\nTaxon (ASPT; Table 4) can be calculated by dividing the total BMWP scores by \n\nthe number of taxa.  \n\nThe %EPT index (Table 4) is based on the fact that macroinvertebrates from \n\nthe families Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera have low tolerance to \n\npollution and represent various functional groups: predators, scrapers and \n\nshredders (Lenat, 1988). \n\nTable 3.

Statistical Analysis  \n\nData was analyzed by MDS (multidimensional scaling), cluster analysis and \n\nANOSIM (analysis of similarities) with the software PRIMER\u00ae version 6.1.13 \n\nand the probability level set at ?=0.05. In MDS, the goal of the analysis is to \n\ndetect meaningful underlying dimensions that allow explaining observed \n\nsimilarities or dissimilarities (distances) between the investigated objects. \n\nCluster analysis is an exploratory data analysis tool which aims at sorting \n\ndifferent objects into groups in a way that the degree of association between \n\ntwo objects is maximal if they belong to the same group and minimal otherwise. \n\nANOSIM provides a way to test statistically whether there is a significant \n\ndifference between two or more groups of sampling units. \n\nThe biological data was transformed with log(x+1) and converted to a \n\nsimilarity matrix using the Bray-Curtis coefficient before analysis. MDS achieved \n\nby a maximum of 500 iterations, a 0.01 minimum stress and a Kruskal fit \n\nscheme 1. For the cluster analysis, agglomeration was achieved with group \n\naverages. A two-way (sampling site and occasion) crossed ANOSIM with no \n\nreplicates was performed with 999 permutations. The transformed matrix was \n\ntested with a one-way SIMPER (Similarity Percentages) analysis using the \n\nBray-Curtis coefficient and a cut-off percentage of 90% to examine the \n\npercentage contribution of each taxon or trait to the similarity within the cluster \n\n21 \n \n\n\n\n  \n\nand to the difference between two clusters. Environmental data was \n\ntransformed as above and normalized (the values for each variable had their \n\nmean subtracted and then divided by their standard deviation) before using the \n\nEuclidean distance to calculate the similarity matrix. A Spearman correlation \n\nwas used to create vectors of the environmental data into the MDS spatial \n\ndistribution of the biological data. \n\n3. Results \n\n3.1.

Species Traits  \n\nThe macroinvertebrate community (Appendix Table 3)  was dominated by \n\nshort life-cycles on almost all sites and sampling dates, with the exception of \n\ndate 4 at L2, L3 and L4 where life-cycles > 1 year where more abundant than \n\nlife-cycles ? 1 year (Figure 6).  \n\n \nFigure 6.

Discussion \nTrait-based approaches provide clear advantages compared to the use of \n\ntaxonomic-based approaches, such as important insights into structure and \n\nfunctioning of stream communities (Usseglio-Polatera et al., 2000) or even dual \n\nadvantages of direct transferability to distant geographic locations and direct \n\ncomparability of biologically determined quality standards (Statzner et al., 2001, \n\n2008; Horrigan and Baird, 2008). However, there are still issues needing \n\nclarification which difficult their application, such as the lack of adequate \n\nunderstanding of how individual traits are intercorrelated (Poff et al., 2006) and \n\nthe alternative trade-offs between traits combinations (e.g., Resh et al.,1994, \n\nUsseglio-Polatera et al., 2000).  \n\nThe objective of the present work was to compare trait-based results with \n\nthose obtained with conventional tools related to community structure \n\n35 \n \n\n\n\n  \n\n(community density, diversity and evenness) and environmental health \n\nassessment (IBMWP, ASPT, %EPT) in order to allow some insight into the way \n\nhow species traits may be used to identify urban stream disturbance. The \n\nresults related with community structure indicated that the macroinvertebrate \n\ncommunity was more diverse and the abundances were more evenly distributed \n\nat L1, the sampling site closer to the source and less modified, with a natural \n\nchannel shape and good riparian vegetation. L2 was the second more diverse \n\nbut one of the worst in relation to evenness, which is probably related to the \n\nhigh environmental variation observed during the four sampling occasions. In \n\nthis site, at late summer the stream channel was filled with macrophytes while \n\nduring winter, and especially after the heavy rains of December-January, the \n\nchannel was filled with debris of a fallen bridge. Also, the high abundance of \n\nsnails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) contributed to the uneven abundance \n\ndistribution. L3 was the second less diverse site and the worst in terms of \n\nevenness. This was related to the slower current velocity (due to the \n\ndownstream dam), the fine sediment composing the substrate, and consequent \n\nhigh abundance of Oligochaeta, mainly Naididae. L4 was the less diverse but \n\nhad one of the highest evenness. The low diversity is probably related to the \n\nfact that this is the sampling site farther away from the source and heavily \n\nmodified both in terms of river channel and riparian vegetation. However, the \n\nevenness of the community suggests that, despite the habitat alterations, a \n\nwell-established macroinvertebrate community is thriving in that environment.  \n\nCommunity richness was higher at the less disturbed site (L1) and \n\ndecreased along the longitudinal gradient \u2013 where multiple stressors contributed \n\nto increasingly disturbed habitats. These results show an  opposite trend to the \n\nones obtained by McCabe and Gotelli (2000), who found higher richness \n\ndisturbance treatments than in undisturbed controls, and also contradict the \n\npattern predicted by the dynamic-equilibrium model of Huston\u2019s (1979, 1994) for \n\ncommunities with the species populations growing rapidly and having high rates \n\nof competitive exclusion. However, the results obtained in this study seem to \n\nsupport the intermediate-disturbance hypothesis, with diversity peaking at an \n\nintermediate level of disturbance (L1) and decreasing with increasing \n\ndisturbance downstream. Evidences for the intermediate-disturbance \n\n36 \n \n\n\n\n  \n\nhypothesis have been found at communities with high rates of competitive \n\ndisplacement (Huston, 1994).  \n\nThe three indexes differed on the quality classification attributed to each site. \n\nThe %EPT showed the existence of heavy disturbance on L2 and L3 while both \n\nIBMWP and ASPT classified both sites as very good quality or with no sensitive \n\nalterations (IBMWP) or as good quality status (ASPT). L1 ranged from good \n\nquality (ASPT), to unpolluted with no sensitive alterations (IBMWP) and to \n\nundisturbed (%EPT), mainly due to the abundance of intolerant taxa. In fact, it \n\nwas the only site where Plecoptera were found (Nemoura sp.). L2 had the best \n\nIBMWP and ASPT scores but %EPT abundance and richness were among the \n\nlowest, granting a classification of heavily disturbed. This may be related, as \n\ndiscussed above, with the drastic seasonal variation observed at this location. \n\nSimilarly, L3 was also well classified in terms of IBMWP and ASPT scores, with \n\ngood to moderate quality but the %EPT abundance was the lowest granting a \n\nclassification of heavily disturbed. As discussed above, the characteristics of the \n\nriver bed and the reduced flow might have prevented the existence of a more \n\ndiverse macroinvertebrate community, especially the members of the EPT \n\ngroup. According to IBMWP and ASPT, L4 had moderate to good quality status \n\nwith some slight effects of pollution or alteration but had the highest percentage \n\nof members of the EPT group and the second best richness among them. \n\nThese results are in agreement with the general objectives of the indices, with \n\nIBMWP and ASPT mainly assessing the effect of organic pollution (Hawkes, \n\n1998) while several EPT members are reasonable tolerant to nutrient \n\nenrichment (Hall and Lenwood, 2006). \n\nAs in other studies where taxonomic data suggested only a weak and \n\ninconsistent response of biodiversity to hydromorphological impact in the lotic \n\nenvironment (e.g. Feld et al., 2014, Gerisch et al., 2011), in the present study \n\ntaxonomic data did not distinguish habitat alterations due to either temporal or \n\nspatial variability. The same was true for the single trait analyses which \n\nrevealed no significant differences among sampling sites or dates. Regarding \n\nthe feeding method, the community was dominated by shredders in almost all \n\nsampling dates at sites L1 to L3, revealing that although this feeding group may \n\n37 \n \n\n\n\n  \n\nbe abundant in impacted streams (Tolkkeinen et al., 2013) it does not overcome \n\nthe multiple stressors related to habitat alteration at L4.  \n\nThe combined use of the five traits allowed the separation of dates, thus \n\nrevealing that the combination of traits is more sensitive to environmental \n\nvariation than its individual counterparts. Environmental variability related to \n\ndate was more pronounced than environmental variability related to sampling \n\nsite, which explains the absence of significant differences among the four \n\nsampling sites \u2013 related to the inexistence of heavy distortions along the \n\nlongitudinal gradient of the stream, and the significant differences among the \n\nsampling occasions \u2013 related to the high seasonal variability during the study \n\nperiod, especially regarding precipitation events and consequent effects in the \n\nstream habitat.  \n\nThe high precipitation events which occurred before sampling date 3 caused \n\nalterations in water chemistry (ammonia, nitrates and orthophosphates), as well \n\nas pH, TDS and conductivity, which clustered the combination of traits in the \n\nMDS and cluster analysis. Additionally, the occurrence of high densities of taxa \n\nsuch as Naididae sp. in only the last sampling occasion introduce a strong \n\ntemporal rather than a spatial trend. Those highly abundant but temporally \n\nconcentrated taxa were dominated, in terms of traits, by resistance in the form \n\nof eggs, gemmules, statoblasts, and shells, by feeders of fine sediment, by \n\ntegument respiration, and by swimmers in open water. Thus, these traits also \n\ncontributed significantly for the separation of the data by sampling date instead \n\nof sampling site.  \n\nThe multi-trait MDS analysis (Figure 12) provided no insight into the relation \n\nof species traits and conventional community and water quality assessment \n\nmethods, since the groups included highly variable classifications of water \n\nquality based on %EPT, IBMWP and ASPT and also community diversity and \n\nevenness. The biggest group formed by 80% similarity corresponded to quality \n\nclassifications of the %EPT and the biotic indices ranging from poor to very \n\ngood and to community diversity and evenness ranging from low to high. The \n\nsecond biggest group formed by three samples from date 4 (L2, L3 and L4) \n\nranged from poor to moderate quality with medium to high diversity compared \n\n38 \n \n\n\n\n  \n\nand the worst abundance distributions. The group containing the remaining \n\nsamples at 65% similarity (Figure 12) ranged poor to good quality and from \n\nmedium to high diversity and the best abundance distribution of species. \n\nIn conclusion, although the use of the five traits did not allow a spatial \n\nseparation of the study sites, it clearly separated sampling dates whose \n\nenvironmental variables were also distinct. Thus, the use of traits allows \n\ndistinguishing samples that are clearly associated to variables related to habitat \n\ncharacteristics. The lack of a pronounced quality gradient along the longitudinal \n\nstream profile limited the possibility of finding significant differences among \n\nsites. Moreover, because sampling was carried out only four times, and did not \n\ncomplete a full seasonal cycle, some of results obtained could not be attributed \n\nto a natural pattern or to the effect of perturbation, such as urbanization effects \n\nor land use. A more complete data set collected at sites with a more \n\npronounced quality gradient is necessary to assess the utility of the trait-based \n\napproaches on the evaluation of disturbance in urban streams. \n\n5.
