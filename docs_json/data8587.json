Page model was adjusted to the experimental drying curves, and the calculated drying times\nshowed that the best pretreatment consisted in dipping grapes for 2 minutes in a 5% olive oil and 6% K2CO3\nemulsion, at 50oC, which resulted in a drying time close to that of the pretreatment with 2.5% of olive oil, but with\na lower consumption of this substance. In addition, the immersion of grapes in an aqueous suspension of 2% soy\nlecithin, at 50oC, for 5 minutes, resulted in a total drying time slightly higher than the most effective pretreatment.\n\nIndex terms: Vitis vinifera, drying kinetics, soybean lecithin, olive oil, dipping treatments.\n\nTaxas de secagem de uva Rubi submetida a pr\u00e9-tratamentos qu\u00edmicos\npara a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de passas\n\nResumo \u2013 O objetivo deste trabalho foi selecionar o pr\u00e9-tratamento qu\u00edmico mais apropriado para a secagem de\nuvas cv.

Almost all raisin\nconsumed in Brazil is imported, but the production of\ntable grapes has been increasing, and there is a great\n\npotential to use surplus or out-of-standard fruits to\nproduce raisins, reducing losses of fresh fruits and\naggregating value to the product (Gabas et al., 1998).\n\nBrazilian production of table grapes can be divided in\ntwo major groups: the fine grapes (Vitis vinifera), mainly\nrepresented by cultivars such as It\u00e1lia and its mutations\nRubi, Benitaka and Brasil, in addition to Red Globe and\nsome seedless cultivars, and the rustic grapes\n\n\n\nPesq. agropec. bras., Bras\u00edlia, v.41, n.3, p.503-509, mar. 2006\n\nV.R.N. Telis et al.504\n\n(Vitis labrusca), of which the most famous cultivars\nare Isabel and Niagara (Almeida, 2003; Nachtigal, 2003).\nThree new cultivars of seedless grapes, that are ideal\nfor raisin production, adapted to the tropical climate, were\nrecently presented (Camargo, 2003).\n\nThe waxy cuticle of grape skin controls the rate of\nmoisture diffusion through the berries and, in order to\naccelerate drying, chemical treatments are applied to\nremove or modify this cuticle and increase grape skin\npermeability to water (Gabas et al., 1999; Pangavhane\net al., 1999). The first dipping mixture consisted of olive\noil and wood ash, but was substituted by an emulsion\nmade up of a solution of approximately 2.5% food gra-\nde potassium carbonate (K2CO3) and 1.5\u20132.0% of\ncommercial \u201cgrape dipping oil\u201d (Ponting &amp; McBean,\n1970). This oil is a mixture of about 70% of ethyl esters\nof C16 and C18 fatty acids with free oleic acid and\nemulsifiers. The composition of this emulsion has\nprobably been achieved by trial and error plus tradition,\nalong with the practice of adding K2CO3 and dipping\nfor 3 minutes. The active components are the esters and\nthe K2CO3, which also assists in emulsification by\nneutralizing the free oleic acid in the oil to form soap\n(Grncarevic &amp; Lewis, 1976).\n\nBolin &amp; Stafford (1981) succeeded in improving grape\ndrying rates with a methyl oleate:K2CO3 (1:1) mixture,\nwhereas increasing carbonate levels increased drying\nrates. Gabas et al. (1999) found that increasing\nconcentration of ethyl oleate between 0 and 3%, in a\nsolution of 2% CaCO3, increased drying rates and\nresulted in raisins with a less collapsed structure.\nDifferent alkaline substances at different concentrations\nand temperatures, with or without addition of olive oil,\nwere investigated by Pahlavanzadeh et al. (2001), who\nobtained the shortest drying time and best quality raisins\nby dipping grapes in a 5% solution of K2CO3, at 42oC.\nThey alerted that skin damage might result from\npretreatment with high alkaline solutions. Di Matteo\net al. (2000) proposed a physical treatment with super-\nficial abrasion of grape peel and found it to be as effective\nas chemical dipping methods in reducing drying times.\n\nConventional chemical pretreatments are based on\nthe action of surfactants, present in dipping emulsions; it\nwould be of interest to test the effectiveness of other\nsurfactants. Lecithin is a GRAS (generally regarded as\nsafe) emulsifier composed of different phospholipids,\nglycolipids, carbohydrates and triglycerides and is largely\nused in foods (Fennema, 1996). Soy lecithin is a coproduct\nof degumming solvent extracted of soybean oil and could\n\nbe a natural alternative surfactant to be applied in grape\ndrying pretreatments. For Brazilian producers, a\ntreatment based in soy lecithin dispersions would be\neconomically advantageous, since olive oil and the other\ncommercial \u201cdipping oils\u201d are imported ingredients.\n\nMathematical modeling of the dehydration process is\nvery useful in design and optimization of dryers. The\nmost widely used theoretical model that describes drying\nkinetics of food materials is the solution of Fick\u2019s second\nlaw of diffusion (Nicoleti et al., 2001). Nevertheless, for\nhigh moisture content materials such as fruits and\nvegetables, this analytical solution \u2013 obtained considering\nconstant diffusivity and volume \u2013 is not always\napplicable, since shrinkage and diffusivity as functions\nof moisture content need to be taken into account. To\novercome this problem without making use of complex\nnumerical solutions, empirical models have been applied\nand Page model is frequently used (Parti, 1998).\n\nThe objective of this work was to obtain drying cur-\nves and to compare drying rates of Rubi grapes\npretreated in potassium carbonate/olive oil mixtures and\nin soy lecithin/water dispersions.\n\nMaterial and Methods\n\nRipe, fresh grapes (Vitis vinifera) cv. Rubi were\nobtained at the local market in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto, SP,\nBrazil. The soluble solids content was around 15.8oBrix\nand moisture content around 0.84 kg water per kilogram\nof wet material.\n\nChemical pretreatments consisted of immersing grape\nberries, during a pre-determined time interval, in aqueous\nsuspensions of commercial olive oil and K2CO3, or in\naqueous dispersions of commercial unbleached soybean\nlecithin, according to two-level factorial designs (Box\net al., 1978) with independent variables and respective\nlevels given in Table 1.\n\nSolutions of the desired concentration of K2CO3 were\nprepared in distilled water and heated at 50oC, on a hot\nplate with magnetic stirring. Olive oil was then slowly\npoured into this solution, which was kept under\ncontinuous agitation during dipping of grapes. Aqueous\ndispersion of lecithin was carried out in a similar manner,\nwith lecithin being directly poured into distilled water\nat 50oC under stirring. The temperature of all treatments\nwas kept constant at 50oC.\n\nThe drying equipment was a pilot scale tray drier,\nwhich consisted of three basic sections \u2013 an airflow\nsystem, a drying air heating section and a drying chamber\n\n\n\nPesq. agropec. bras., Bras\u00edlia, v.41, n.3, p.503-509, mar. 2006\n\nDrying rates of Rubi grapes for raisin production 505\n\n(Figure 1). The drying compartment consisted of\nfour square metal trays, placed perpendicularly to the\nairflow. Air was forced through an axial blower, with air\nvelocity being measured by means of an anemometer.\nA set of electrical resistances was installed to heat the\nair. A digital thermometer (Full Gauge, model Penta)\nmeasured dry bulb temperature just before air flowing\nthrough in drying trays. Relative humidity of the ambient\nair and just of the air before flowing through in drying\nchamber was measured by thermo-hygrometers (Lutron,\nmodel HT-3004). A \u2018honeycomb\u2019 was installed before\nthe drying chamber to allow better distribution of air\nthrough the product.\n\nThe berries were placed in a single layer over the\ntray and inserted into the dryer cabinet, after desired\noperating conditions had been achieved. The tray\ncontaining samples was weighed at regular time intervals.\nDrying runs were carried out at a constant temperature\nof 50oC and air velocity of 1 m s-1. The initial moisture\ncontent of grapes was determined gravimetrically, using\na vacuum oven (Marconi, model MA-030) at 60oC and\n110 mm Hg for 48 hours. In order to determine the\nequilibrium moisture content, drying runs were conducted\nuntil changes in sample mass were less than 0.1 g.\n\nPage model (equation 1) was fitted to experimental\ndrying curves by non-linear regression, using the software\nSatistica v.5.0 (Statsoft, 1995):\n\n)exp(-kt\nXX\nXX\n\nM n\neq0\n\neq =\n?\n\n?\n=                   (1)\n\nin which, M is the dimensionless moisture, X is the\nmoisture content at a certain time t, X0 and Xeq are the\ninitial and equilibrium moisture contents, respectively, and\nk and n are the Page drying coefficients, which deter-\nmine the precise shape of the drying curve. While neither\n\nof these parameters has a direct physical significance,\nempirical regression equations have been developed\nrelating both parameters to drying conditions and raw\nmaterial moisture content (Hossain &amp; Bala, 2002; Wang,\n2002).\n\nAccording to Parti (1998), the drying rate for the Page\nmodel is given by:\n\n)X-)(X(-knt\ndt\ndX\n\neq\n1-n= ,                                      (2)\n\nand a modified drying coefficient could be defined as:\n1-nkntk =?                                                         (3)\n\nIf n<1, k* decreases during drying process. Thus,\nhigher values of k could be used to more closely\napproximate the diffusion equation in the initial stages\nof drying, without overpredicting drying in the later stages.\nIf n>1, lower values of k might be adopted, without\nsubestimating the drying curve at the end of the process.\n\nThe quality of the model adjustment was evaluated\nby the correlation coefficient R2, and the root mean\nsquare of residuals, RMS (Lewicki, 2000), calculated\nas:\n\n( )[ ]\nN\n\nMM-M\n100RMS\n\n2\nobsestobs?=                   (4)\n\nin which, Mobs and Mest are, respectively, the values of\ndimensionless moisture observed and estimated by the\nmodel, and N indicates the number of experimental points\nused in the regression procedure.\n\nTable 1. Two level factorial designs for analysis of the effect\nof different pretreatment conditions on drying rates of grapes.\n\nFigure 1. Schematic diagram of resistive dryer with crossed\nairflow.\n\n\n\nPesq. agropec. bras., Bras\u00edlia, v.41, n.3, p.503-509, mar. 2006\n\nV.R.N. Telis et al.506\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nDrying curves for grapes, submitted to different\npretreatment emulsions at 50oC, were obtained and\ncompared with a drying curve determined for untreated\ngrapes (Figure 2). A first set of experiments was carried\nout according a two-level factorial design with a central\npoint, varying concentrations of olive oil and K2CO3 and\nkeeping constant the immersion time of 30 seconds\n(Table 1). The resulting drying curves showed that the\napplied pretreatments were effective in accelerating the\ndrying process, with lower moisture contents at the same\ndrying time being attained by grapes treated with\na 2.5% olive oil and 6% K2CO3 emulsion (Figure 2 A).\n\nAlthough the adjustment of Page model (equation 1)\nto experimental drying curves resulted in correlation\ncoefficients higher than 0.99 (Table 2), there was a lack\nof fitting in the final stage of drying, where the model\nunderpredicted the experimental drying curves (Figu-\nre 2). Some RMS values (Table 2) were higher\nthan 25%, which was appointed by Lewicki (2000) as\nthe maximum limit for acceptance of an adjustment\nmodel. It should be considered, however, that in the last\npart of drying curves, the observed moisture contents\nthat should be inserted in the denominator of equation (4)\nare very low, causing RMS to be increased in spite of a\ngood fit to the most part of the curves.\n\nAfter evaluation of parameters k and n of Page\nequation for each drying condition, the model was used\nto estimate drying times necessary to obtain raisins with\nfinal moisture content around 14% in wet basis (Table 2).\nThese calculations were carried out considering the initial\nmoisture content of 84% (wet basis) \u2013 that corresponds\nto the average value observed in all experimental runs \u2013\n and the equilibrium moisture content of 1.4% (wet basis)\n\u2013 obtained from the average final moisture content\ndetermined in drying runs.\n\nThe effect of olive oil and K2CO3 concentrations, with\nimmersion time of 30 seconds on the necessary drying\ntime to attain 14% moisture content (wet basis), may be\nclearly observed in a surface plot (Figure 3 A). The\nstatistical analysis of the results indicated that only the\nolive oil concentration had a significant effect at 5% level\nof significance, with shorter drying times at higher olive\noil concentrations.\n\nBased on the results of the first set of experiments, it\nwas concluded that an immersion time of 30 seconds\nhad not been enough to cause a great reduction in drying\n\nFigure 2. Drying curves for Rubi grapes dried at 50oC and air\nvelocity of 1 m s-1. Traces represent the adjustment of Page\nmodel (equation 1).\n\ntimes, which were still very long. Additional tests were\nthen carried out increasing immersion time of berries in\n\n\n\nPesq. agropec. bras., Bras\u00edlia, v.41, n.3, p.503-509, mar. 2006\n\nDrying rates of Rubi grapes for raisin production 507\n\nthe mixture of olive oil and K2CO3, and a maximum\nimmersion time of 2 minutes was established (Table 1),\nsince longer immersion times resulted in burning of grape\nskin and formation of cracks. As a consequence, the\nraisins presented a sticky surface that was visually\nassociated to a bad product quality.\n\nDrying curves determined to samples pretreated in\nemulsions of 0.5% and 2.5% olive oil and 6% K2CO3,\nwith immersion for 2 minutes, were compared with those\nobtained with immersion time of 30 seconds\n(Figure 2 B). Also, with the objective of clearly\nestablishing the effect of olive oil, a drying run was\nconducted after immersion of grapes in a 6% solution\nof pure K2CO3. The results showed that olive oil had an\nimportant effect in accelerating drying process, since\ngrapes pretreated with pure potassium carbonate\npresented the highest moisture contents at the same\ndrying times. In addition, it was observed that increasing\nimmersion time in alkaline solutions, during the\npretreatment of grapes, was more effective to reduce\ndrying time than increasing olive oil concentrations\n(Figure 3 B).\n\nOther works have already investigated the influence\nof pretreatments with olive oil and K2CO3 on drying\nkinetics of grapes, however no results were obtained to\nallow comparison between different concentrations of\n\nolive oil and K2CO3 (Pangavhane et al., 1999; Vazquez\net al., 1999; Pahlavanzadeh et al., 2001; Doymaz &amp; Pala,\n\nTable 2. Drying times (DT) necessary to attain\nabout 14% moisture (wet basis) and Page model parameters\nfor Rubi grapes dried at 50oC and air velocity of 1 m s-1,\nsubmitted to various chemical pretreatments(1).\n\nFigure 3.

Although most of these\nworks have used dipping emulsions with 0.4 or 0.5% of\nolive oil, and 5 or 7% of K2CO3, there is a great\ndiscrepancy between immersion times adopted, which\nvaried from 20 seconds to 5 minutes. Drying conditions\nwere also very different. For a pretreatment with 0.4%\nolive oil in 7% K2CO3 solution, for 3 minutes at ambient\ntemperature, and convective drying with air at 60oC\nand 0.5 m s-1, Pangavhane et al. (1999) obtained\nk = 0.0615 h-1 (equation 1), which is somewhat higher\nthan the value of 0.0533 h-1 found in the present work\nfor similar pretreatment conditions. The difference could\nbe attributed to the longer immersion time of the\npretreatment and to the higher drying temperature used\nin that work. Doymaz &amp; Pala (2002) observed a\nreduction of 54.2% in the drying time of grapes treated\nwith 5% K2CO3 plus 5% olive oil, when comparing with\ndrying time of grapes without pretreatment at the same\ndrying temperature (60oC). In this work, a similar\nreduction of drying time (53.6%) was observed, when\ncomparing drying of grapes treated with 6% K2CO3 plus\n5% olive oil, for 2 minutes, with nontreated grapes.\n\nFrom the results presented above, it was possible to\nconclude that, when using traditional dipping emulsions\nof olive oil and potassium carbonate, the immersion time\nduring pretreatment assumes a preponderant role, which\ncould be attributed to a low reaction rate of the active\ncomponents of the emulsion, and the constituents of the\nwaxy layer of grape skin. During treatment with alkaline\nsolutions, attention should be drawn to the necessary\nimmersion time to increase water vapor permeability\nthrough grape skin and the maximum immersion time to\navoid crack formation and burning of grape skin. This\nwould require a great degree of control during processing,\nwhich is not always feasible in small processing plants.\nAn alternative of practical interest would be to avoid\nthe use of alkaline substances during pretreatment, which\ncould be possible by using soy lecithin \u2013 a natural\nsurfactant \u2013 in order to eliminate or modify the structure\nof the grape skin waxy layer.\n\nDrying curves obtained after pretreatments, in\ndispersions of 2 and 4% of soy lecithin with immersion\ntimes of 2 and 5 minutes (Table 1), showed that lecithin\nwas effective to accelerate drying process when\ncomparing with untreated grapes (Figure 2 C). In\naddition, a surface plot of drying times as affected by\nimmersion time and lecithin concentration showed that,\nalthough neither of the variables was significant at\n5% level, increasing immersion time in the lecithin\n\nsuspension was more effective to reduce drying time\nthan increasing lecithin concentration (Figure 3 C).\n\nComparison of drying curves of lecithin treated grapes\nwith that of grapes treated with olive oil and K2CO3,\nhowever, demands a more careful analysis. At the initial\nstage of drying, moisture contents of grapes treated in\nthe alkaline emulsion were considerably lower than those\nobserved in lecithin treated grapes at the same drying\ntimes. Nevertheless, at the end of the process, the drying\ncurve of grapes treated with olive oil and K2CO3 assumed\nan asymptotic behavior, resulting in a very small change\nof moisture content with time. At the same time, the\ndrying curve of grapes immersed for 5 minutes in lecithin\ndispersions showed a continuous decrease in moisture\ncontent that led to similar total drying times (Table 2).\n\nIt was observed that treatments with lecithin resulted\nin the highest n values, indicating that there was not a\nreduction in drying rates at low moisture contents\n(Table 2). When pretreatment was carried out in the\n2.5% olive oil and 6% K2CO3 emulsion for 2 minutes,\nthe lowest value of n was obtained, showing that with\nthis treatment the drying rate decreased along the\nprocess. This behavior might be attributed to the\ndeposition of olive oil on grapes surface, which could be\nvisually detected by the oily aspect of the raisins resulted\nfrom this treatment.\n\nThis work presented some preliminary results, that\nmust be further investigated, in order to determine the\nbest treatment conditions, as well as to investigate the\nmechanism of action of lecithin on the waxy layer of\ngrape skin. It is also important to point out that drying\ntimes presented in Table 2 are superestimated, since they\nwere calculated using Page model fittings, which showed\na weak agreement to experimental data at low moisture\ncontents. Also, the convective drying temperature could\nbe increased from 50 to 60oC, in order to accelerate\ndehydration.\n\nConclusions\n\n1. The most effective treatment to accelerate drying\nprocess is an emulsion of 0.5% of olive oil and 6% of\nK2CO3, at 50oC, with immersion time of 2 minutes.\n\n2. Increasing the immersion time of grapes in the\nchemical treatment reduces drying time.\n\n3.
