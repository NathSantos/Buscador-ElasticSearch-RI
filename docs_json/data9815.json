There is a recent growing interest in the development of alternative technologies to the \n\noil economy, based on renewable energy sources. A possible solution is a biofuel usable in \n\ncompression-ignition engines, produced from biomass rich in fats and oils. A wide range of \n\nraw materials can be used in the production of biodiesel. Nevertheless, the use of sources that \n\ndo not compete with the food market like waste cooking oils, which usually feature high \n\nlevels of free fatty acids (FFA\u2019s), can put problems in the process of production of biodiesel \n\nthrough alkaline transesterification. These problems are partially overcome by the use of \n\ncatalysts, such as ionic liquids (IL\u2019s) that also promote reactions of esterification of FFA\u2019s to \n\nbiodiesel. Thus, the objective of this work consists in the study of the influence of IL's \n\napplication in the catalysis of: esterification reactions of organic acids to the corresponding \n\nmethyl esters. \n\nIn the first part of the work the influence, as catalysts, of several ionic liquids in the \n\nesterification reaction of oleic acid was analyzed. The experimental conditions were as \n\nfollows: reaction time 6 hours, oleic acid / methanol molar ratio = 1/10 and temperature 90 \u00b0 \n\nC. The ionic liquids evaluated were as follows: 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen \n\nsulfate ([BMIM][HSO4]), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium methanesulfonate \n\n([BMIM][CH3SO3]), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium methylsulfate ([BMIM][CH3SO4]), 1-\n\nmetylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate ([MIM][HSO4]) and tributylmethylammonium \n\nmethylsulfate. The values obtained for the conversion of the oleic acid esterification reaction \n\nshowed that the ionic liquid [BMIM] [HSO4] would be one of the most promising catalysts.  \n\nIn a second part of the work, the recovery of LI [BMIM] [HSO4] was studied and several \n\nesterification reactions of oleic acid were carried out using a quantity of catalyst of 10 wt%, \n\n15 wt% and 20 wt% relative to the mass of oleic acid. The experimental conditions were as \n\nfollows: reaction time 6 hours, oleic acid / methanol molar ratio = 1/10 and temperature 90 \u00b0 \n\nC. The reaction yield was found to be 76.6% to 10% IL, 83.3% to 15% IL and 84.8% to 20% \n\nIL. These yields decreased to 58.2% (10% IL) with 4 cycles of recycling, 75.2% (15% IL) \n\nwith 5 cycles of recycling and 77.1% (20% IL) with 5 cycles of recycling. The results \n\nobtained confirm that it is possible to reuse this IL in successive reactions of esterification \n\nwithout great loss of yield and with this to significantly reduce the costs associated with the \n\npurchase of these compounds that are quite expensive. \n\n\n\niii \n \n\nKeywords: Biodiesel, Esterification, Ionic Liquids, Recovery \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\niv \n \n\nResumo \n \n\nO biodiesel \u00e9 um combust\u00edvel alternativo que pode ser produzido a partir de \u00f3leos vegetais e \n\nde gorduras animais. Atualmente existe um crescente interesse no desenvolvimento de \n\ntecnologias alternativas \u00e0 economia do petr\u00f3leo baseadas em fontes de energia renov\u00e1veis. \n\nUma poss\u00edvel solu\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de um biocombust\u00edvel em motores de compress\u00e3o-\n\nigni\u00e7\u00e3o, produzido a partir de biomassa rica em \u00f3leos e gorduras. Para a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nbiodiesel pode ser usada uma ampla gama de mat\u00e9rias-primas. No entanto, o uso de fontes \n\nque n\u00e3o competem com o mercado alimentar, como por exemplo os \u00f3leos alimentares usados, \n\nque geralmente t\u00eam um elevado n\u00edvel de \u00e1cidos gordos livres (AGL\u00b4s), pode trazer problemas \n\nao processo de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de biodiesel atrav\u00e9s da transesterifica\u00e7\u00e3o alcalina. Estes problemas \n\ns\u00e3o parcialmente ultrapassados usando catalisadores, tais como os l\u00edquidos i\u00f3nicos (LI\u00b4s), que \n\ntamb\u00e9m promovem as rea\u00e7\u00f5es de esterifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos AGL\u00b4s a biodiesel. \n\nAssim, o objetivo desta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o de mestrado consistiu no estudo da aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de l\u00edquidos \n\ni\u00f3nicos como catalisadores nas rea\u00e7\u00f5es de esterifica\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1cidos org\u00e2nicos aos \n\ncorrespondentes \u00e9steres met\u00edlicos. \n\nNa primeira parte do trabalho analisou-se a influ\u00eancia, como catalisadores, de diversos \n\nl\u00edquidos i\u00f3nicos na rea\u00e7\u00e3o de esterifica\u00e7\u00e3o do \u00e1cido oleico. Os l\u00edquidos i\u00f3nicos avaliados \n\nforam os seguintes: 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate ([BMIM][HSO4]), 1-\n\nbutyl-3-methylimidazolium methanesulfonate ([BMIM][CH3SO3]), 1-butyl-3-\n\nmethylimidazolium methylsulfate ([BMIM][CH3SO4]), 1-metylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate \n\n([MIM][HSO4]) and tributylmethylammonium methylsulfate. Os valores obtidos para a \n\nconvers\u00e3o da rea\u00e7\u00e3o de esterifica\u00e7\u00e3o do \u00e1cido oleico mostraram que o l\u00edquido i\u00f3nico \n\n[BMIM][HSO4] seria um dos mais promissores como catalisador.  \n\nNuma segunda parte do trabalho procedeu-se ao estudo da recupera\u00e7\u00e3o do LI \n\n[BMIM][HSO4], tendo-se realizado diversas rea\u00e7\u00f5es de esterifica\u00e7\u00e3o do \u00e1cido oleico usando \n\numa quantidade de catalisador de 10%, 15% e 20% (m/m) relativamente \u00e0 massa de \u00e1cido \n\noleico. As condi\u00e7\u00f5es experimentais foram as seguintes: tempo de rea\u00e7\u00e3o 6 horas, raz\u00e3o molar \n\n\u00e1cido oleico/metanol = 1/10 e temperatura 90 \u00b0C. Verificou-se que o rendimento da rea\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nfoi de 76,6 % para 10% de LI, 83,3% para 15% de LI e 84,8% para 20% de LI. Estes \n\nrendimentos diminu\u00edram para 58,2% (10% de LI) com 4 atapas de reciclagem, 75,2% (15% \n\nde LI) com 5 etapas de reciclagem e 77,1% (20% de LI) com 5 etapas de reciclagem. Os \n\nresultados obtidos permitem confirmar que \u00e9 poss\u00edvel reutilizar este LI em rea\u00e7\u00f5es sucessivas \n\n\n\nv \n \n\nde esterifica\u00e7\u00e3o sem grande perda de rendimento e com isso diminuir significativamente os \n\ncustos associados \u00e0 compra destes compostos que s\u00e3o bastante caros. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Biodiesel, Esterifica\u00e7\u00e3o, L\u00edquidos I\u00f3nicos, Reutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nvi \n \n\n??????????? \n \n\n??????????? ?????????????? ????????? ??????? ?, ??? ???????? ? ???????? \n\n???????? ? ?????????? ????????: ?????? ???????? ????? ? \n\n???????????????? ?????????????? ??????????????` ???????? \n\n???????????, ?????????? ???????????? ????????? ??????????? ????????: \n\n???????? ??????? ? ?????? ?????? ???????????? ????????????? \n\n????????????, ??? ????????? ? ???????? ? ???????? ??????? \n\n??????????????: ??????????? ???????????? ??? ???????? ? ?????????? \n\n?????? ???? ???????: ??????????? ?????? ??????????? ??? ?????????? \n\n????????? ??????? ?????????????: ???????? ??` ??????????? ???????? \n\n?????????? ???????, ????? ??????????? ?????????? ?? ???????????? ???? \n\n???????? ????????

In \n\nthis context, a possible solution is a biofuel usable in compression ignition engines (or diesel \n\nengines), produced from biomass rich in fats and oils. Thus, a wide range of raw materials \n\ncan be used in the production of biodiesel. However, the use of sources that do not compete \n\nwith the food market, like waste cooking oils, which usually feature high levels of free fatty \n\nacids (FFA\u2019s), can add problems to the classic process of biodiesel production through \n\nalkaline transesterification. These problems can be partially overcome by the use of \n\ncatalysts, such as ionic liquids (IL\u2019s) that promote also the reactions of esterification of \n\nFFA\u2019s in biodiesel. \n\nOne of the attractive characteristics of biodiesel is that its use does not require any \n\nsignificant modifications to the diesel engine, so the engine does not have to be dedicated \n\nfor biodiesel. However, similar to alcohol fuels, biodiesel has lower energy content and \n\ndifferent physical properties than diesel fuels [Tat et al., 2002].  \n\nBiodiesel fuel has recently attracted increasing worldwide attention as a blending \n\ncomponent or a direct replacement for diesel fuel in vehicle engines. For example, B5 used \n\nin Europe contains 5% of biodiesel (B100) and 95% of petro diesel. Biodiesel blends up to \n\nB20 can be used in nearly all diesel equipment and are compatible with most storage and \n\ndistribution equipment [Ahmia et al., 2014]. \n\nBiodiesel is a non-toxic, biodegradable and renewable fuel. It has significantly lower \n\nemissions than petroleum-based diesel when it is burned, whether used in its pure form or \n\nblended with petroleum diesel. It does not contribute to a net rise in the level of carbon \n\ndioxide in the atmosphere and leads to minimize the intensity of greenhouse effect and \n\nbiodiesel is better than diesel fuel in terms of sulphur content, flash point, aromatic content \n\nand biodegradability [Ahmia et. al., 2014]. There is a wide range of raw materials suitable \n\nfor the production of biodiesel. However, first generation edible oils are the main resources \n\nfor world biodiesel production.  \n\nThe main goal of this work consists in the study of the influence of IL's application in the \n\ncatalysis of esterification and transesterification reactions which lead to the synthesis of \n\nfatty acid methyl esters (FAME) mixtures, which constitute the ester biodiesel products. The \n\ncentral focus is concerned with the study of IL recovery. For the recover and recycle of ILs \n\nthe first used distillation. It is important to note that the interaction of ILs with water is \n\n\n\n \n\n2 \n \n\nmainly affected by the size of ILs, hydrophobicity and hydrogen bonding ability of both \n\ncations and anions, will determine the techniques used for recovery of ILs. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n \n\n1.1 Background and Motivation \n \n\nAlternative diesel fuel has attracted more attention in the last three decades. For this \n\npurpose, ester biodiesel has been studied as a source of bioenergy, which can potentially \n\nsubstitute petrochemical based diesel fuels. \n\nWide range of raw materials can be used in the production of biodiesel.  It has the advantage \n\nof dramatically reduce sulphate, hydrocarbon and particulate matter emissions. It is nontoxic \n\nand does not contaminate water sources. Biodiesel is a fuel that can be made from pure or \n\nwaste vegetable oils such as soy and rapeseed (canola) oils, and may be used in any diesel \n\nautomotive engine in its pure form or blended with petroleum-based diesel, without the \n\nrequirement of hardly any modification in the diesel engine, leading to a less-expensive, \n\nrenewable and clean-burning fuel. However, the use of second generation non-edible \n\nsources, which do not compete with the food market like waste cooking oils and feature \n\nhigh levels of acidity, can induce difficulties in the operation of the classic process of \n\nproduction of biodiesel by alkaline transesterification. These problems can be overcome by \n\nthe use of catalysts, such as ionic liquids (IL\u2019s) that promote also the reactions of \n\nesterification of Free Fatty Acids (FFA\u2019s) to biodiesel. In this work we will study the \n\nperformance of imidazolium-based ionic liquids in the replacement of the classic \n\nhomogeneous and heterogeneous, acid and alkaline catalysts generally used for the \n\nproduction of ester biodiesel. Imidazolium based ionic liquids are the most studied species \n\nfor this type of applications, due to its inherent ionic patterns, low pressure and ability of \n\nself-organization in different states. This class of ionic liquids has been progressively used \n\nas green solvents in order to replace the volatile and relatively toxic organic solvents, in \n\nhomogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, materials science, nanomaterials, lithium ion \n\nbatteries, and process separation technologies. Therefore, the main objective of this work \n\nconsists in the study of the effect of the application of these IL's species in the catalysis of \n\nesterification reactions of organic acids to the corresponding methyl esters. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n \n\n1.2 Structure of the report \n \n\nChapter 1 presents background and motivation. Chapter 2 of this thesis present an \n\nintroduction to biodiesel as a renewable source, its properties and production processes. \n\nChapter 3 is the literature review with information about ionic liquids and its types and \n\nproperties. Chapter 4 gives a description of the experimental protocols developed and \n\nimplemented and Chapter 5 presents the results and discussion of the work. Finally, in \n\nChapter 6 the main conclusions and suggestions for future work are presented. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n \n\n2 Biodiesel \n2.1 Biodiesel as a renewable energy source \n \n\nBiodiesel or ester based biodiesel is an alternative diesel fuel that is produced from \n\nvegetable oils and animal fat by transesterification with an alcohol (usually methanol). It is \n\nused as an additive to petrodiesel fuels, with different contents, promoting possible vehicle \n\ndecreases greenhouse gas emissions up to 20%. It also can be used in its pure form as a \n\nrenewable alternative fuel for diesel engines [http://www.renewableenergyworld.com]. \n\nThus, biodiesel can be mixed in any proportion with petroleum diesel [Tat et  al., 2002] and \n\nit does not contribute to a rise of the net concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, \n\nand leads to minimize the intensity of greenhouse effects [Ahmia et al., 2014].  \n\n \n\n2.2 Physicochemical properties \n \n\nBiodiesel is a liquid biofuel, which colour ranges from golden to dark brown, depending on \n\nthe production method and is slightly miscible with water. The main biodiesel \n\nphysicochemical properties are given in Table 1. \n\nEach of the most important physicochemical properties referred in Table 1 are explained in \n\nmore detail below: \n\nKinematic Viscosity: It is defined as the resistance to flow of a fluid under gravity. It is a \n\nbasic design specification for fuel injectors used in diesel engines. For biodiesel it is a quick \n\nand easy method for estimating the stage of completion of a batch synthesis reaction \n\n[Biodiesel handling and use guide, 2016]. \n\nCarbon residue: The carbon residue of a fuel is the tendency of carbon deposits to form \n\nunder high temperature in an inert atmosphere. Using ordinary diesel fuel, the carbon \n\nresidue is measured using a 10% distillation residue. Because B100 boils entirely at the high \n\nend of the diesel fuel range and in a very narrow temperature range, it is difficult to leave \n\nonly a 10% residue when distilling biodiesel. So, for biodiesel carbon residue \n\nmeasurements, all biodiesel samples have to be used rather than the 10% distilled residue \n\n[Biodiesel handling and use guide, 2016]. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n \n\nTable 1.  Biodiesel main properties [Biodiesel handling and use guide, 2016]. \n\nFuel properties Biodiesel \n\nKinematic viscosity at 40?C, ??2/s 4.0 to 6.0 \n\nCarbon, wt% 77 \n\nTotal glycerol, wt% 0.240 \n\nFree glycerol, wt% 0.02 \nSulphated ash, wt% 0.020 \n\nFlash point, ?C 100-170 \n\nBoiling point, ?C 315-350 \n\nSulphur, wt% 0.0 to 0.0015 \n\nPour point, ?C -5 to 10 \n\nCloud point, ?C -3 to 15 \n\nCetane number 47 to 60 \n\nHigher heating value (MJ/kg) 42.65 \n\nLower heating value (MJ/kg) 33-42 \n\n \n\nTotal Glycerol: Total glycerol is the sum of free and bonded glycerol [Taimur, 2011]. \n\nFree Glycerol: Free glycerol is the glycerol present as molecular glycerol in the fuel. It \n\nresults from incomplete separation of the ester and glycerol products after the \n\ntransesterification reaction.  This can be a result of imperfect water washing or other \n\napproaches that do not effectively separate the glycerol from the biodiesel [Taimur, 2011]. \n\nBonded glycerol: Is the glycerol portion of the mono-, di-, and triglyceride molecules. High \n\nvalues of total glycerin are indicators of incomplete esterification reactions and predictors of \n\nexcessive carbon deposits in the engine. \n\nSulphated Ash: Sulphated ash is a residue remaining after a fuel sample has been \n\ncarbonized. The residue is then treated with sulphuric acid and heated to a constant weight. \n\nThis test controls the mineral ash residual when fuel is burned. For biodiesel, this test is an \n\nimportant indicator of the amount of residual metals in the fuel that came from the catalyst \n\nused in the esterification process [Taimur, 2011]. \n\nFlash point: Flash point of a fuel is defined as the temperature at which it will ignite when \n\nexposed to flame or spark [Ved et al., 2013].  A minimum flash point for diesel fuel is \n\nrequired for fire safety. B100 flash point value must be at least 93\u00b0C to provide that all the \n\nexcess alcohol introduced in the production process is removed from the final biodiesel \n\nproduct. \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n \n\nSulphur:  Biodiesel must have less than 15 ppm in sulphur content, in order to reduce \n\nsulphate and sulfuric acid pollutant emissions [Biodiesel handling and use guide, 2016]. \n\nPour point: The temperature at which the fuel contains so many agglomerated crystals, that \n\nit is essentially a gel and will no longer flow. Distributors and blenders use pour point as an \n\nindicator of whether the fuel can be pumped; otherwise it would not be suitable for use \n\nwithout heating or other treatment procedures [Biodiesel handling and use guide, 2016]. \n\nCloud point: It is the most frequently used indicator of low-temperature operability. Fuels \n\nare generally expected to operate at temperatures as low as their cloud point. The cloud \n\npoint of B100 is typically higher than the cloud point of conventional diesel fuel [Biodiesel \n\nhandling and use guide, 2016]. \n\nCetane number:  Cetane number is an indicator of the combustion speed of a diesel type \n\nfuel and the compression needed for ignition. A sufficient cetane number is needed for good \n\nengine performance. Normal diesel must have a cetane number of at least 40. [Biodiesel \n\nhandling and use guide, 2016]. \n\nHigher Heating Value: Amount of energy released by the combustion of a unit value of \n\nfuel. \n\nLower Heating Value: Amount of heat released by the combustion of a sample of fuel \n\nminus the energy needed for the evaporation of its water content. Therefore, the Lower \n\nHeating Value is always less than the Higher Heating Value.  \n\n  \n\n2.3 Benefits of biodiesel use \n \n\nThe lower contribution of biodiesel use to the rise of the net concentration of carbon dioxide \n\nin the atmosphere and minimization of global greenhouse effects can be explained by an \n\nanalysis of the biodiesel life cycle. Therefore, when oilseed plants grow, they take carbon \n\ndioxide (CO2) from the air to make the stems, roots, leaves, and seeds. After the oil is \n\nextracted from the oilseeds, it is converted into biodiesel. When the biodiesel is burned CO2 \n\nand other emissions are released and returned to the atmosphere. Eventually, most of this \n\nemitted CO2 does not add to the net CO2 concentration in the air because the next oilseed \n\ncrop will reuse the CO2 as it grows. A small part of the emitted carbon is fossil derived \n\nbecause of fossil fuel and chemicals used in farming and in the biodiesel production process. \n\n[Biodiesel handling and use guide, 2016]. \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n \n\n2.4 Advantages and disadvantages of biodiesel \n \n\nBiodiesel has many major advantages, and some minor disadvantages. In Table 2 a \n\ncomparison between ester biodiesel and petrodiesel main features is summarised. \n\nTable 2. Comparison of biodiesel with petrodiesel. \nAdvantages  Disadvantages  \n\n\u2022 Biodiesel is produced from renewable \n\nsources; biodiesel fuel is a renewable \n\nenergy source. \n\n\u2022 In comparison with diesel fuel, \n\nbiodiesel is less toxic [Hoekman et al., \n\n2012]:  \n\n\u2022 Has lower emission of contaminants  \n\n[http://www.conserve-energy-\n\nfuture.com-2016]; \n\n\u2022 Lower health risk. Although burning \n\nbiodiesel produces carbon dioxide, it \n\ndoes not contribute to global warming \n\n[http://www.conserve-energy-\n\nfuture.com-2016];  \n\n\u2022 B100 can reduce carbon dioxide \n\nemissions by 78% and lower the \n\ncarcinogenic properties of diesel fuel \n\nby 94% [Azad et al., 2013] \n\n\u2022 Biodiesel is better for vehicle engines \n\nthan conventional diesel: it provides \n\ngreater lubrication [Azad et al., 2013]; \n\n\u2022 Biodiesel have a higher flash point \n\n(100? minimum) than diesel (52-\n\n96?), which make biodiesel less \n\ncombustible. It is safer to store and \n\ntransport. \n\n\u2022 Biodiesel has about 10% higher \n\nNitrogen Oxides (NOX) content \n\nthan other petroleum products. \n\nNitrogen Oxide is one gas that is \n\nused in the formation of smog and \n\nozone. Once it gets dissolved in \n\natmospheric moisture, can cause \n\nacid rain [http://www.conserve-\n\nenergy-future.com-2016]. \n\n\u2022 Biodiesel cleans dirt from the \n\nengine. This proves to be an \n\nadvantage of biofuels but it is \n\npossible that this dirt may get \n\ncollected in fuel filters and clog \n\nthem [http://www.conserve-energy-\n\nfuture.com-2016]; \n\n\u2022 B20 blends can be used in some \n\nvery cold climates, where \n\ntemperatures routinely fall below -\n\n30?F (1?C) [Biodiesel handling and \n\nuse guide, 2016], but biodiesel\u2019s \n\nfreeze point may be 20\u00ba to 30\u00baF \n\nhigher than that of petroleum diesel, \n\nwhich may cause limitations in cold \n\nweather operability. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n \n\n2.5 Energy balance \n \n\nAccording to biodiesel lifecycle studies, or energy balances, done by the United States \n\nDepartment of Energy, it was concluded that the production and use of biodiesel reduces \n\n78.5% of carbon dioxide emissions, unburned hydrocarbons and particulate matter. This can \n\nbe explained by biodiesel's partially closed carbon cycle [Biodiesel Instructor-2011] referred \n\nabove. Overall, from the biodiesel energy balance (see Table 3), it can be concluded that for \n\na unit of fossil energy needed to make biodiesel, 4.5 units of energy are gained. On the other \n\nhand, regular fossil fuels take more energy to produce than they provide in return \n\n[http://articles.extension.org-2016].  \n\nTable 3. Summary of Energy Balance/Energy Life Cycle [http://dartonrefuel.com/biodiesel.php/]. \n\n \n\n* Energy Yield - Life cycle yield in liquid fuel. BTU\u2019s for each BTU of energy consumed \n\n[http://dartonrefuel.com/biodiesel.php/]. \n\n \n\n2.6 The biodiesel production and consumption in the world  \n \n\nDue to its non-toxicity and biodegradability, biodiesel has become an alternative fuel in the \n\ntransportation sector, and a possible solution to environmental issues [Hassan et al., 2013]. \n\nThe European Union is expanding its B5 (blend of 5% (v/v) biodiesel with 95% petrodiesel) \n\nblend to a B7 (blend of 7% (v/v) biodiesel with 93% petrodiesel) specification as part of the \n\nFuel Quality Directive passed in December 2003. The renewable energy policy includes an \n\nobligatory 10% goal for transportation fuels such as hydrogen, biofuels and electricity.  This \n\nnew requirement updated the 5.75% renewable substitution aim of 2010, determined in \n\n2003, to a more ambitious goal. However the 2003 aim of about 10% for biofuels in 2020 \n\nwas kept as an obligatory aim. The greenhouse gas aim for biofuels to take effect in 2011 \n\nwas set at a 35% decline when compared with fossil fuels. In 2017, the demand is raised to a \n\n50% decrease, and for new producers after 2017, the aim will be 60% \n\nFuel Biodiesel Ethanol Diesel Gasoline \n\nEnergy Yield* 4.50 0.805 0.843 0.805 \n\nNet Energy (Loss) or Gain (%) 350 34 15.7 19.5 \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n[www.biodieselmagazine.com-2016]. In Figure 1 the investment of different countries and \n\nregions in biodiesel production is preesented [Johanson et al., 2012]. \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 1. Biodiesel production in different countries, 2009-2010 [Johanson et al., 2012]. \n\n \n\n2.6.1 Biodiesel Consumption  \n \n\nRenewables sources have played an increasing role in the energy sector.  In 2015 their \n\ncontribution was \u20ac16 billion and it is projected to be \u20ac58 billion in 2030, and  thanks to fast \n\ndecreasing costs owing to technological advancement, especially in the power sector, \n\nrenewables can also be gradually further integrated in the market. Biodiesel is the main \n\nbiofuel used for transport in the EU, representing 79% of total use of biofuels in 2015. The \n\nmain consumers of biodiesel are France, Germany and Italy. Renewable energy in Transport \n\nsector comes largely from biofuels (88%), with electricity playing a more limited role. In the \n\nEU, biofuels production exceeded by three times the planned trajectory, with around 3 \n\nMillion tons in 2015, mainly because of the utilization of used cooking oil. The share of \n\nbiofuels produced from wastes and residues, like waste cooking oils, in the EU has \n\nincreased from 1% in 2009 to 23% in 2015  [Renewable Energy Progress Report, 2017].   \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n \n\n  \n\nFigure 2.  EU-28 renewable energy in transport, by source (source: EUROSTAT, \u00d6ko-Institut) \n[Renewable Energy Progress Report- 2017] \n\n \n\nIn EU, biodiesel consumption showed 0.5% marginal increase. In Figure 3, it is presented \n\nthe production of biodiesel in Portugal after 2006. The data of 2016 to 2018 is a forecast. In \n\nPortugal the production of biodiesel from 2015 to 2016 increased 2.3% [Phillips et al., \n\n2016]. \n\n \n\nFigure 3. Production of biodiesel in Portugal 2006-2018 (Million litres) [Phillips et al., 2016]. \n\n \n\n2.6.2 Raw materials for Biodiesel production \n \n\nBiodiesel is produced from vegetable oils all over the world. But, for biodiesel production, it \n\ncan also be used animal fats, like white grease or lard, fish fat and chicken fat [Ahmia et al., \n\n2014].  \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n \n\nFigure 4 shows the relative importance of soybean oil as biodiesel feedstock in the EU and \n\nPortugal. It can be seen that soybean oil is the major feedstock in Portugal and the second in \n\nEU [Castanheira et al., 2015]. \n\nThe most used oils for worldwide biodiesel production are rapeseed (EU), soybean \n\n(Argentina and USA), and palm (Asian and Central America) and sunflower, although other \n\noils or fats are also used, including peanut, linseed, safflower, used vegetable oils, and \n\nanimal fats [Romano et al., 2011]. \n\nOn the other hand non-edible oil feedstocks range from castor oil to jatropha, tung, cotton, \n\njojoba and microalgae oils, which proved to be highly promising and reliable sources, \n\nhaving high oil content. Algae oil, due to its availability and low cost is considered as an \n\neconomical choice for biodiesel production [Gashaw et al., 2014].   \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4. Feedstock used for biodiesel production in the European Union and Portugal   \n[Castanheira et al., 2015]. \n\nMicroalgae, a large and diverse group of aquatic organisms that lack the complex cell \n\nstructures found in higher plants [Slade et al., 2013], appear to be a very important \n\nalternative for future biodiesel production due to its potential oil yield; however, its \n\napplication for biofuel production is still commercially limited [Romano et al., 2011], due to \n\nthe highly energetic intensive technologies available for algae oil recovery. \n\n \n\n2.7   Production of biodiesel \n \n\nThe recent interests in biodiesel reside in the regular rises in oil prices and the disappearing \n\nresources of fossil fuels. These issues boosted the interest in biodiesel production from both \n\nanimal and vegetable fats. In fact, intensive usage of petroleum based materials and fuels are \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n \n\nan important factor in air pollution: an extremely important problem, as mankind may face a \n\nglobal warming crisis [Earle et al. 2009]. \n\nEster biodiesel, which is a mixture of Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAME), is made through \n\nthe transesterification of animal fat or vegetable oils. Fats are mainly constituted by \n\nmixtures of triglycerides, which are triesters of glycerol, molecules with a glycerol core \n\nconnected to 3 fatty acid chains by ester groups. The most important fatty acid ester \n\nderivative is oleic acid, but oils usually exhibit smaller contents of fatty acid saturated \n\nchains (of varying lengths) and some double unsaturated chains (like linoleic acid ester \n\nderivatives). For fatty esters, both acid- and base-catalysed transesterifications reactions are \n\npossible. However, base catalysed transesterification to methyl or ethyl esters usually \n\nrequire slightly higher reaction temperatures [Earle et al., 2009]. \n\nBiodiesel can also be produced by esterification of free fatty acids (FFAs) derived from \n\nvegetable oils, with separation of the water by-product from the FAME product. For fatty \n\nacids, the acid-catalysed esterification reaction is preferred. The base-catalysed esterification \n\nto methyl and ethyl esters is not used because the catalyst is deactivated by reaction with the \n\ncarboxylic acid group to form a carboxylic acid salt, which is often called soap [Earle et al., \n\n2009]. \n\nTable 4 summarizes the biodiesel production processes: FAME is produced from vegetable \n\noils, animal fats or waste cooking oils by transesterification. In the transesterification \n\nprocess a triglyceride reacts with an alcohol in the presence of a catalyst, forming a mixture \n\nof fatty acids esters and another alcohol. Using triglycerides results in the production of \n\nglycerol as a by-product [http://www.biofuelstp.eu - 2016].  On the other hand, vegetable \n\noils and animal fats, which are typically branched or straight chain molecules, may also be \n\nhydrotreated in order to de-oxygenate the fatty acids and saturate any double bonds, \n\nproducing paraffinic hydrocarbons. Synthetic diesel and gasoline can also be produced by \n\ngasification of dried wood, agriculture residues, straw, corn, garbage, food scraps, and \n\nsewage-sludge into synthesis gas, which is subsequently converted to hydrocarbon liquid \n\nproducts by Fischer-Tropsch processes. The overall processes are often called biomass to \n\nliquids (BTL) [Biomass Gasification Facility for Clean Synthetic Diesel Fuels - 2009]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n \n\nTable 4.

Esterification occurs \n\nwhen a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol. The overall esterification process takes place \n\naccording to the chemical equation shown in Figure 5. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5. Biodiesel synthesis by esterification process from Free Fatty acid with alcohol [Maria et \n\nal., 2011]. \n\n \n\nIn Figure 6 basic technology of biodiesel esterification process. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n \n\n \nFigure 6. Basic technology of biodiesel esterification process.  \n\n \n\nAs stated above, the most used industrial process for ester biodiesel production is \n\ntransesterification. This reaction of an alcohol with an ester to produce another alcohol and \n\nester is a conversion process similar to hydrolysis, except that an alcohol is used instead of \n\nwater. Suitable alcohols include methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, and amyl alcohol. \n\nMethanol is most frequently used, because of its low cost and its physical and chemical \n\nadvantages [Hideki et al., 2001]. \n\nIn this process, a three step reaction mechanism is assumed, where triglycerides and \n\nmonoglycerides act as intermediates. The overall transesterification process occurs \n\naccording to the chemical equation shown in Figure 7. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 7. Biodiesel synthesis by transesterification process from vegetable oils with methanol [Ullah \n\net al., 2014]. \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n \n\nConsidering a base catalysed process, an amount of alkali (for example NaOH) slowly \n\ndissolves in alcohol excess (usually methanol). This methoxide mixture is mixed with warm \n\npreheated oil at about 50?, and allowed to react for 1 to 8 hours to ensure a complete \n\ntransesterification reaction. In pressurised conditions, the reaction mixture may be \n\nmaintained above the alcohol boiling point (70?), but for normal pressure systems, it is \n\nrecommended to maintain the temperature range from room temperature to 55 ?, for safety \n\nreasons. Under normal pressure conditions, the reaction time is usually from 1 to 10 hours, \n\nand it is important to avoid a sealed system in order to prevent the risk of explosion, because \n\nthe reaction rate is doubled by raising the reaction temperature by 10 ?. In pressurised \n\nconditions and to prevent evaporation of the alcohol, the reaction should be carried out in a \n\nclosed container [www.bioethanol.ru-2016] or using a reflux process. In Figure 8 it is shown \n\nthe basic technology for ester biodiesel production. \n\nThe use of mineral acids in acid catalysed processes has some disadvantages such as \n\nequipment corrosion, long workup procedure and environmental problems. Recently, \n\nreplacement of these hazardous liquid acids by solid acid catalysts has been essential, but \n\nthese catalysts show also some disadvantages such as low activity, easy deactivation and \n\nadsorption/desorption of products [Aghabarari et al., 2013]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8. Basic technology of biodiesel transesterification process [www.bioethanol.ru-2016]. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n \n\n3  Ionic liquids \n\nAn ionic liquid is a molten salt consisting of a cation and an anion, with low melting \n\ntemperature. The earliest discovery of ionic liquids (ILs) was in the mid nineteenth-century \n\nwhen \u201cred oil\u201d, generated by Friedel-Crafts reaction, was used as a solvent for separation \n\nanalysis. In 1914 Paul Walden reported the first widely-known ionic liquid, ethyl \n\nammonium nitrate. Interest in the study of ionic liquids became more intense in 1963, after \n\nthe research project of Major (Dr.) Lowell A. King of the US Air Force Academy. Later, in \n\n1990, the professor from US Air Force Academy, Dr. Mike Zaworodko discovered the \n\nsolution for the problems faced by Dr. King which gave a new dimension for using of ionic \n\nliquids in electrochemistry. Since then, due to its unique properties and possible uses, ILs \n\ndrew the interest of scientific researches and even several industries [Terencia et al., 2010].   \n\nILs consist of ions and remain liquid at temperatures lower than 100 \n?\nC. Typical IL cations \n\nare nitrogen-containing (such as alkylammonium, N-dialkylimidazolium, N-alkylpyridinium \n\nand pyrrolidinium), or phosphorous containing (such as alkylphosphonium). The common \n\nchoices of anions include halides, BF4\u2013 , PF6\u2013 , CH3CO2\u2013 , CF3CO2\u2013 , NO3\u2013 , Tf2N\u2013  \n\n[i.e.,(CF3SO2)2N]\u2013 , [RSO4] and [R2PO4] [Zhao et al., 2012].  The overall properties of ILs \n\nderived from the composite properties of the cations and anions and include those that are \n\nsuperacidic, basic, hydrophilic, water miscible, and water immiscible and hydrophobic. The \n\nanion is currently used to control the water solubility, but the cation can also influence the \n\nhydrophobicity or hydrogen bonding ability [Huddleston et al., 2001].  Some cations and \n\nanions are shown in Figure 9. \n\nImidazolium-based ionic liquids have been used as green solvents to replace the volatile and \n\nrelatively toxic organic solvents, in homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, materials \n\nscience, nano materials, lithium ion batteries, and separation technology. Imidazolium based \n\nionic liquids, because of its inherent ionic patterns, low pressure and ability of self-\n\norganization in different states, are considered as the most studied species [Woon et. al., \n\n2012]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n \n\nAnions: \n\n \nCations: \n\n \n \n\nFigure 9. Chemical structure of ionic liquids [http://www.sigmaaldrich.com-2016]. \n\n \n\n3.1    Classification of ionic liquids \n \n\nIonic liquids are good solvents, environmentally benign, nonvolatile, nonflammable, and \n\nstable in air or water. Because of these special properties, ionic liquids have been widely \n\ninvestigated as solvents for synthetic chemistry and catalysis [Zhang et al., 2007]. Ionic \n\nliquids are generally divided into two broad classes, one based on chlorometallate anions \n\nsuch as heptachlorodialuminate ([Al2Cl7]-) and the other based on anions not containing \n\nmetals, such as hexafluorophosphate ([PF6]-) [Andreani et al., 2012]. There are a large \n\nnumber of imidazolium-based ILs, few ILs based on quaternary ammonium have been \n\nreported. Quaternary ammonium salts (\u201cquats\u201d) because of its surface-active properties, \n\npossess anti-microbial activity are an economically advantageous class of industrial \n\ncompounds. Most of these solvents remove lignin and alter cellulose structure, which \n\nincreases the accessibility of cellulolytic enzymes [Visser et al., 2007]. \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n \n\n \n \n\nTetrofluoroborate Thyocyanate \n\n  \n\nDicyaneamide Hexafluorophosphate \n \n\nFigure 10. Selected anions of phosphonium- and ammonium-based ILs [Stojanovic et al., 2011]. \n\n \n\nILs plays a crucial role when applied as solvents or catalysts for different reactions at high \n\ntemperatures, or if the reaction products should be distilled from the ionic liquid at high \n\ntemperatures Ammonium and phosphonium ILs both can decompose at elevated \n\ntemperatures, but phosphonium salts are generally more stable as their ammonium analogs \n\n[Stojanovic et al., 2011]. \n\nIn this work different Ionic Liquids, were studied, with structures presented in Figure 11. \n\n  \n1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate \n\n  \n\n1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium methyl sulfate Tributylmethylammonium methyl sulfate \n\n  \n1-Methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium methanesulfonate \n\n \n\nFigure 11. Structure of different ILs \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n \n\n3.2 Ionic liquid properties \n \n\n ILs has many positive properties such as low flammability, high ionic conductivity, high \n\nthermal conductivity, high dissolution capability toward many substrates, high thermal and \n\nchemical stability [Zhao et al., 2012]. The ionic liquids possessed greener properties such as \n\nsignificantly less toxic compared to the organic solvent. In addition, they can be colourless, \n\nhave high catalytic activity, low viscosity, potential recyclability, and are easily \n\nmanipulated. The highly interesting characteristic of ionic liquids is the ability of designing \n\na molecule, target for a particular application or in order for getting a certain set of \n\nproperties such as melting point, viscosity, density, water solubility and selectivity \n\n[Andreani et al., 2012]. ILs contains large, organic cations with a variety of anions and \n\nmelts at or below about 100 \u00b0C [Huddleston et al., 2001]. The active research of ILs as \n\nalternative solvents and catalysts in the chemical or enzymatic (biocatalytic) production of \n\nbiodiesel has gained momentum [Hua et al., 2013].  The first industrial process involving \n\nionic liquids was announced in March, 2003, by BASF, and is called BASIL (Biphasic Acid \n\nScavenging Using Ionic Liquids). This process generates an ionic liquid in situ to remove \n\nHCl formed during the production of alkoxyphenylphosphines. The resultant \n\nalkoxyphenylphosphine is used as an important precursor for the synthesis of photoinitiators \n\nused in various industrial processes. The ionic liquid is separated from the product and can \n\nbe removed by decantation, presenting advantages of cost and easiness compared to \n\nfiltration. The use of ionic liquids increases the yield of this process by a factor of 80,000 \n\ncompared to the conventional process [Andreani et al., 2012]. ILs have great chemical and \n\nthermal solubility which is also tuneable based on the combination of cation and anion. For \n\nbiodiesel synthesis, the ILs is capable of dissolving a wide array of substrates and more \n\nimportantly, increasing their stability over a longer period during the reaction. The ionic \n\nliquids (ILs) offer an excellent media for many lipase-catalysed esterification or \n\ntransesterification reactions compared to the organic solvents wherein an increased in the \n\nactivity and specificity of the lipase enzyme was spotted. Many recent studies, proved the \n\nILs as more environmental friendly solvents and catalysts for biodiesel reactions and \n\nseparation [Muhammad et al., 2015]. \n\nIonic liquids can be used as single catalysts in the processes of biodiesel production, either \n\nby esterification or transesterification, provided that some ionic liquids present Bronsted \n\nacidity or basicity.  \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n \n\nBronsted acidic ILs, were highly efficient catalyst for biodiesel synthesis from vegetable \n\noils. Sulfuric acid groups in these ILs are the active sites for transesterification [Guo et al., \n\n2011]. \n\nCurrently, there are several scientific works published about the production of biodiesel \n\nusing ionic liquids. Some of these works are referred in Table 5. \n\n\u2022 Ren and co-workers studied the production of biodiesel using as catalyst [Hnmm] \n\nOH, a basic ionic IL. The raw material used was soybean oil. They analysed several \n\nreaction parameters such as the influence of catalyst concentration on the biodiesel \n\nyield, the effect of methanol / soybean oil molar ratio and the effect of reaction time. \n\nThe authors found out that the catalyst had an excellent catalytic performance at 70 \n\n\u00b0C reaction temperature, 1.5 h of reaction time, 3% wt catalyst dosage and a molar \n\nratio of MeOH/oil = 8/1. The obtained reaction yield was about 90% [Ren et. al., \n\n2014]. \n\n\u2022 In 2011, the production of biodiesel was studied by Guo et al., using as catalyst \n\n[BMIM][CH3SO3] \u2013FeCl3 and [BMIM][CH3SO3] \u2013AlCl3, a basic ionic IL. The raw \n\nmaterial used was Jatropha oil. At high temperature of 120 \u00b0C, the reaction time 5 h. \n\n  ??3+ had a relatively higher activity than that of Al3+ (99.7% vs. 94%). \n\n\u2022 Using palm oil and BMIMHSO4 as catalyst, a reaction temperature of 160 \u00baC, 1 h for \n\nthe reaction time and 1% wt of catalyst, [ Elsheikh et al., 2011], obtained a reaction \n\nyield of 98.4%. \n\n\u2022 In another experiments from Fang and his colleagues different catalysts [C4MIM] \n\n[NTf2] and [C2MIM][TfO] were used for production of biodiesel. During all \n\nexperiments raw material used Soybean oil. The first experiment was at room \n\ntemperature, second experiment was at 50 \u00b0C and reaction time is  12 h. The reaction \n\nyield was 96 % and 80 % [Fang et al., 2014]. \n\n\u2022 For production biodiesel is used triolein oils with different catalysts \n\n([C18MIM][NTf2] and [C16MIM][NTf2]), a basic ionic IL. The process was doing in \n\nthe same temperature (60\u00b0C). The one experiment was a 6 h; another experiment was \n\na 24 h. The reaction yield was 96 %, 99% [Fang et al., 2014]. \n\n\u2022 The production of biodiesel from waste cooking oil was studied by Ullah and co-\n\nworkers. They used as catalyst BMIMHSO4, a basic ionic IL. The catalyst was \n\nefficient in the first hour of reaction with the yield reaching up to 95.65%. After that \n\nthere was no considerable change in the yield, therefore the reaction time of 1 h was \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n \n\nidentified as the optimum reaction time, at high temperature of  160 \u00b0C [Ullah et \n\nal.,2015]. \n\n \n\nTable 5.

For example, acid catalysts are \n\nmainly used when the oil has a high concentration of free fatty acids, with sulphuric and \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n \n\nsulfonic acids as the most common catalysts of this class. As disadvantages, the acid \n\ncatalysis requires the use of large amounts of alcohol additionally; acid catalysts such as \n\nsulphuric acid catalyse the transesterification of triglycerides slowly even when refluxing \n\nwith methanol, leading to long reaction times such as 48-96 hours. And there is the risk of \n\ncorrosion of the equipment used due to the high acidity of those catalysts [Adreani et al., \n\n2012]. \n\nIonic liquids are more expensive than conventional solvents and catalysts used in chemical \n\nreactions. Two of the most commonly used ionic liquids are 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium \n\ntetrafluoroborate ([BMI][BF4]) and 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate \n\n([BMI][PF6]) [Andreani et al, 2012]. But the use of ionic liquids in catalytic systems seems \n\nto be environmentally secure. The possibility of recovery and reuse of ionic liquids \n\nminimizes the waste in catalytic reactions. Ionic liquids have been using in most number of \n\nchemical reaction types. The important advantage of using ionic liquids in reactions is their \n\nnon-volatility except at high pressures and low temperatures. ILs possesse numerous \n\nadvantages over the conventional organic solvents (they possessed greener properties such \n\nas very low relative volatility i.e., wide liquid temperature and significantly less toxic \n\ncompared to the organic solvent).  More important is their ability to selectively dissolve \n\nvarious organic, inorganic, and organometallic materials due to their tuneable polarity which \n\ncan be designed for specific purposes. In view of the environmental friendly nature of ILs, \n\nthe catalyst also referred to as green catalyst. ILs is considered prospective catalysts for \n\nbiodiesel production. Using ILs based catalyst could reduce the number of reactions and \n\npurification steps required in the biodiesel preparation and separation hence rendering the \n\nprocess to be more economically competitive [Muhammad et al., 2015]. \n \n\n3.4 Ionic Liquids recovery \n \n\nIn nowadays ILs can be used for developing new processes that are technologically, \n\nenvironmentally and economically advantageous. However ILs has typically high costs. So, \n\nfor an improvement in the economic, efficiency the recycling and reuse of ILs are critical.  \n\nAlso, recovery of ILs is important to minimise the environmental concerns of the disposal, \n\nlike biodegradation and toxicity (they can be mixed with other products). Even though ILs is \n\nconsidered as homogeneous catalysts because they are in the same phase as the reactants, its \n\ncapability to be recovered and recycled is an advantage over conventional homogeneous \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n \n\nsolvents.  For the recovery and recycle of ILs the most used method is distillation, because \n\nILs show low vapour pressures. It is important to note that the interaction of ILs with water, \n\nwhich is mainly affected by the size of ILs, hydrophobicity and hydrogen bonding ability of \n\nboth cations and anions, will determine the techniques used for its recovery. Among these \n\neffects, the nature of anions largely determines the behaviour of the IL-water mixture. \n\nHydrophobic ILs which is immiscible with water can be easily separated from water by \n\ndecantation. Additionally, many molecular solvents including water are immiscible with ILs \n\nand can be used to extract or separate materials from the IL solutions [Freire et al., 2007]. \n\nFor the recovery of ILs there are used different methods  \n\n\u2022 Distillation is the simplest method for the recovery of ILs. First ILs is removed by \n\ndecantation, filtration and/or extraction, and also by washing with water/organic \n\nsolvents. After that, distillation can be used for recycling and reuse of ILs [Mai et \n\nal., 2014]. For example [BMIM][FeCl4] IL is heated in the oven at 105 \u00baC for 24 h to \n\nevaporate water [Fauzi et al., 2014]. For recovery of [BMIM][HSO4], it is washed \n\nwith distilled water to remove any impurities, and afterwards heated in the oven at \n\n105 \u00baC for 24 h to remove traces of water and unreacted methanol [Fauzi, 2014]. \n\n[HMIM][HSO4] can be used in the ester exchange reaction after washing with ethyl \n\nacetate; excess ethyl acetate was removed by reduced-pressure distillation. It was \n\nfound that [HMIM][HSO4] recycled 4 times can still retain stable catalytic \n\nperformance [Xu Wei et al., 2015]. Adsorption can be used for retaining ILs onto \n\nsolid supports such as activated carbon (AC), silica (SiO2), alumina (Al2O3), \n\ntitanium dioxide (TiO2), and clays [Mai et al., 2014]. \n\n\u2022 After reaction the water was added to the reaction mixture and then the solid was \n\nisolated by filtration. The IL in water could be recovered easily by evaporation at 80 \n\n\u00baC in a vacuum. The recovered IL was washed with diethyl ether and dried at 80\u00baC \n\nin a vacuum for 1h [Abbaspour-Gilandeha, 2014]. \n\n\u2022 An alternative method for recovery ILs which does not use high thermal application \n\nis extraction of IL using carbon dioxide. Blanchard and Brennecke demonstrated the \n\nseparation of an ionic liquid ([BMIM] [PF6]) from a number of organic compounds \n\nusing supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) extraction method. The method is \n\neffective because organic compounds are soluble in CO2, while ILs is insoluble. This \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n \n\nenabled the separation of organic compounds from IL, and depressurization is then \n\napplied to remove solutes from CO2 [Fauzi et al., 2012]. \n\n\u2022 Recovery of ILs can also be performed by crystallization processes. Using this \n\nmethod, crystals of ILs are easily separated from the reaction mixture as they are in \n\ndifferent phases. The temperature at which the IL solidifies are important in this \n\nmethod. Hayyan studied the use of 1-butanol as an anti-solvent for the separation of \n\ncholine chloride from glycerin after the transesterification process. After the \n\nintroduction of the anti-solvent into the glycerin phase, the temperature was reduced \n\nto -20 \u00b0C, and the crystals of choline chloride were separated. Further filtration under \n\nvacuum was required to recover the IL [Fauzi et al., 2012]. \n\nIn Table 6 recent published studies are shown involving ILs recovery for reactions of \n\nbiodiesel production, using different oils and ionic liquids, emphasizing the effects of \n\nreaction and time reaction on production yield. \n\nTable 6.

After each reaction, the obtained samples were separated in aqueous and \n\norganic phases by decantation and centrifugation. Both organic (biodiesel) and aqueous \n\n(with ionic liquid) samples were dried and stored in the refrigerator (4 \u00baC) for further \n\nanalysis. After each reaction test, the reaction yield was determined using the acidity of the \n\norganic phase measured by volumetric titration. The characterization of the produced \n\nbiodiesel samples was measured qualitatively and quantitatively by determination of Fatty \n\nAcid Methyl Esters content by the Gas Chromatography (GC). Additionally, initial and final \n\nsamples of the selected ionic liquid were characterized by UV-Vis and FT-IR spectroscopy. \n\n \n\n4.2  Chemicals and Equipment \n \n\nOleic acid (cis-9-octadecenoic acid) (?90%) was purchased from Fluka and heptadecanoate \n\nmethyl ester (?97%), used as internal standard in the GC analysis was obtained from TCI \n\nCompany, Japan.

The methanol and \n\noleic acid (1:10 molar ratio), in this order, were added into the glass reactor. The reactor \n\ncontaining the mixture was then immersed into a paraffin bath. The reactor was then heated \n\nuntil a temperature of 90oC and methanol was added to the reactor.  \n\nhttps://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/#collection=compounds&amp;query_type=mf&amp;query=C14H33NO4S&amp;sort=mw&amp;sort_dir=asc\n\n\n \n\n28 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 12. Experimental setup for the esterification: 1) Heater 2) Reactor 3) Condenser. \n\n \n\nThe reaction was stopped after 6 hours and then the reactor was cooled to room temperature. \n\nIt was verified the formation of a single phase inside the reactor. After cooling, the mixture \n\nwas removed from the reactor and transferred into centrifugal tubes (Figure 13). Then the \n\nmixture was centrifuged during 20 minutes at 3000 rpm and the samples inside the tubes \n\nwere stored in the fridge (4 \u00baC).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 13. Tubes with the mixture after reaction: 1) Organic phase 2) Water phase. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n \n\nAfter 24 h into the fridge, the mixture was able to separate into two phases. The phases were \n\nseparated using a pipette and the mass of each phase was measured using an analytical \n\nbalance Adam Equipment ADA-210/I Balance. \n\nBoth phases were then stored in 10 mL brown flasks inside the fridge for further analysis: \n\nacidity determination, and characterization by GC, UV-Vis and FT-IR. \n\n \n\n4.4  Recovery of ILs  \n \n\nIn this work the esterification reaction was studied for biodiesel production using ILs as \n\ncatalysts. The reactions were carried out with three different [BMIM][H2SO4] amounts \n\n(10%, 15% and 20% wt). In each reaction the IL samples were recovered and reused in a \n\nfollowing reaction test maintaining the same IL amount relating to the initial oleic acid \n\nweight. 4 runs were done in 10% reaction sequence, and for 15% and 20% reactions \n\nsequences, 5 runs were done. The recovery procedure is described below:  \n\na. After 2 days from the reaction test, the separation of phases were concluded (see \n\nFigure 14); \n\nb. The organic phase (biodiesel) was analysed by calculating its acidity; \n\n \nFigure 14. Separation Phases. \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n \n\nc. The water phase was treated by evaporation for IL recovery: first it is heated for 1 \n\nhour at 110 ? afterwards the sample is introduced in a vacuum oven at 60?  for 12-\n\n15 h (see Figure 15). \n\n \n\nFigure 15. Vacuum oven. \n\n \n\nAfter evaporation, the ILs were recovered and used for the next reaction. In Figure 16 there \n\nare presented examples of phases before and after IL recovery for the 15% and 20% runs. \n\n  \na) Before Recovery b) After Recovery \n\nFigure 16. ILs samples before and after recovery. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n \n\n4.4.1  Biodiesel Acidity Measurements  \n \n\nFor biodiesel analysis a titration method was used (Method EN 14104:2003). First, an HCl \n\n0.1M solution was prepared and standardized with borax. Then, a KOH alcoholic 0.1 mol/L \n\nsolution was prepared and its concentration was checked with the standardized HCl \n\nsolution. After that 1L of solvent (Ethanol/Diethyl ether 1/1) was also prepared and the \n\nstandardized solution of KOH was diluted to a 0.01M concentration. These solutions were \n\nused for the determination of the acidity of oleic acid and biodiesel samples. \n\na) Determination of acidity of oleic acid/biodiesel (with alcoholic solution of KOH) \n \n\nFor volumetric titration diethyl ester/ethanol 1:1 (v/v) solution was used as the solvent and \n\nphenolphthalein was used as the indicator. First 40 mL of solvent were titrated adding 5 \n\ndrops of phenolphthalein and stirring the mixture while the KOH standard solution was \n\nadded from the burette in order to neutralize the solution until the color changes to light \n\npink. After that 1 mL of biodiesel sample was weighed using a precision balance, and \n\ntitrated with the same solvent, until achieving pink color. \n\nThe acidity of the samples is determined by equation 1. \n\n???? ?????, ?? ? ?? ???\n? ?????????\n\n? =\n?????????(???)\n\n??????????\n   (1) \n\nwhere: \n\nV - Volume of KOH standard solution needed to titrate the sample (mL) \n\n???? - Concentration of potassium hydroxide standard solution (KOH) (mol/L) \n\n??(???) -  Molecular weight of KOH = 56.1 (g/mol) \n\n?????????? - Weight of sample (g). \n\nb) Determination of the biodiesel yield \n\nThe produced biodiesel is a result from the reaction between oleic acid and methanol, in the \n\npresence of a catalyst (IL). Biodiesel is constituted by methyl esters. The yield of the \n\nesterification reaction can be quantified by determining the acidity level according to \n\nequation (2): \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n \n\n????? % =  \n?????\n??\n\n? 100   (2) \n\nwhere: \n\n??- Acidity of oleic acid (initial), (?????/?????? ????), \n\n??- Acidity of sample (final) after reaction, (?????/??????????). \n\n \n\n4.5  Analysis of Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) Content by Gas \nChromatography  \n\n \n\nFor the determination of FAME content of all biodiesel samples a VARIAN CP-3800 gas \n\nchromatography equipment was used (see Figure 17). The system has a FID detector (Flame \n\nIonization Detector) and a Supelcowax-10 capillary column (30mx0.25mmx0.25?m). The \n\nconditions used for analytical method were: \n\n \n\n\u2022 Helium flow-rate (carrier gas): 1 mL/min \n\n\u2022 Oven: 50 ?C (2 min); 4 ?C/min until 220 ?C (total running time: 80 min) \n\n\u2022 Injector temperature: 250 ?C (split ratio 1:5) \n\n\u2022 Sample volume: 1 \u00b5L \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 17.

GC chromatogram obtained for the Supelco 37 FAME standard mix using a Supelcowax-\n10 column. \n\nThe elution order (numbers in the chromatogram) and the retention time of each one of all \n\nthe 37 methyl esters compounds present in the standard mixture were obtained by \n\ncomparison with the analysis using an Omegawax 250 column (similar stationary phase) \n\nalready published by Sigma-Aldrich (Supelco Bulletin 907). This chromatogram, used as \n\nreference, is showed in Figure 19. \n\n \n\nFigure 19.

For the analysis of biodiesel produced by GC, the sample was prepared as \n\ndescribed below: \n\n\u2022 Measure 250 mg of oleic acid or biodiesel to a 10 mL flask.  \n\n\u2022 Add 5 mL of heptane or IS (internal standard) solution (10 mg heptadecanoate \n\nmethyl ester/mL). \n\n\u2022 Shake the solution and let it stand for 1 min. \n\n\u2022 Dry the solution adding a micro-spatula of anhydrous sodium sulfate. Shake and let \n\nthe solution stand until clarification (near 5 min). \n\n\u2022 Inject 1 \u00b5L of the prepared solution. \n\n \n\n4.5.3  Determination of FAME Content \n \n\nFor determination of FAME content of all obtained biodiesel samples (10%, 15% and 20% \n\nIL), it was used the methodology presented by European Standard EN 14103-2003 (using an \n\ninternal standard - heptadecanoate methyl ester). \n\nTo calculate the FAME content, expressed as a mass content in percentage, the following \n\nequation was used: \n \n \n\n? =\n( ??)????\n\n???\n?  ???????\n\n?\n? 100%  (3) \n\n \nwhere: \n\n?? - total peak area from the methyl ester in C14 to that in C24:1; \n\n??? - peak area corresponding to methyl heptadecanoate; \n\n??? - concentration of the methyl heptadecanoate solution being used, mg/mL; \n\n???-  volume of the methyl heptadecanoate solution being used, mL; \n\n? - mass of the sample, mg; \n\nFor calculated methyl ester area and the total FAMEs area, was used the following equation:    \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n \n\n% ????? =\n??\n\n???????\n? 100%  (4) \n\n% ????????? =\n??????\n???\n\n? 100%  (5) \n\nwhere: \n\n?? \u2013 area of component i, %; \n\n??????? \u2013 Total area of FAMEs, %; \n\n?? \u2013 Total area of peaks, %. \n\n \n\n4.6 Ionic Liquid Analysis with UV Spectrophotometer \n \n\nFor this analysis the VARIAN Cary 50 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer was used (see Figure \n\n20). \n\nPreparation the sample: \n\n\u2022 Measure 0.05 mL of Ionic Liquid to a 100 mL flask.  \n\n\u2022 Add 100 mL of methanol (MeOH). \n\n\u2022 Shake the solution manually. \n\n\u2022 Then measure 0.5 mL of the solution to a 50 mL flask. \n\n\u2022 Add 50 mL of MeOH. \n\n\u2022 Analyse the solution by UV. \n\n \n\nFigure 20. VARIAN Cary 50 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer. \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n \n\n4.7 Ionic Liquid Analysis with Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy \n(FTIR) \n\n \n\nMid-Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a highly reliable and well recognized fingerprinting \n\nmethod. By this analysis more substances can be characterized, identified and also \n\nquantified. By IR spectroscopy spectra from a very wide range of solids, liquids and gases \n\ncan be obtained. For ILs characterization a FTIR ABB MB300 spectrometer was used (see \n\nFigure 21).  \n\n \n\nFigure 21. FTIR ABB MB300 spectrometer. \n\n \n\nAs with all FT-IR measurements, an infrared background is collected, in this case, from the \n\nclean ATR crystal. The crystals are usually cleaned by using a solvent soaked piece of \n\ntissue. Typically water, methanol or isopropanol are used to clean ATR crystals. The ATR \n\ncrystal must be checked for contamination and carry over before sample presentation, this is \n\ntrue for all liquids. After the crystal has been cleaned and an infrared background has been \n\ncollected, the liquid is simply poured onto the crystal. The whole crystal must be covered if \n\nperforming a quantitative or qualitative analysis. The crystal is recessed into the metal plate \n\nto retain the sample (see Figure 22). \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 22. A multiple reflection ATR system. \n\n \n\n5 Results and Discussion \n \n\n5.1 The Selection of the Ionic Liquid \n \n\nFor the selection of the best ionic liquid for the esterification reaction, between oleic acid \n\nand methanol several experiments were made using different IL\u00b4s as catalysts. The \n\nparameters for each reaction and the conversion are presented in Table 9, for the IL\u00b4s used \n\nand also for sulfuric acid. Amount of sulfuric acid was a 10%. \n\nFor the experiments done with ionic liquids as catalysts the molar ratio between oleic acid \n\nand methanol was 1/10 and the quantity of IL was 10%, 15%, 20 % of oleic acid. In the first \n\nexperiment 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate was used as catalyst. And the \n\nreaction time was 2 hours. After the reaction, it was necessary to wait 7 days for the \n\nseparation of phases. After that time some water was, added to the mixture and then this \n\nmixture was left to rest for 2 days and after separation of phases occurred.  The yield of this \n\nreaction was a 57.7 %. The second experiment was done in the same way, but this time 1-\n\nbutyl-3-methylimidazolium methyl sulfate was used as catalyst and reaction time was 4 \n\nhours. With this IL the separation of phases occurred after 2 days. And the conversion was a \n\n76.4 %. For the experiment 3 the catalyst used was 1-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate. \n\nThe reaction time was 6 hours. Right after reaction finished, the phases separated. Next day \n\nit was possible to separate the phases and measure the respective masses. The conversion \n\nwas 88.5 %. \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n \n\nTable 9. Biodiesel production yield using different ionic liquids in different time (10% IL) \n\n \n\n \n\nThe reaction using 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium methanesulfanate as catalyst took 6 hours. \n\nIn this case the phases took 2 weeks to separate. It was verified that the acidity of organic \n\nphase was a higher compared to the other experiments and the conversion was only 18.4 %. \n\nThe next experiment was done using tributylmethylammonium methyl sulphate as catalyst. \n\nThe conditions used to the reaction were the same as before. In this case the phases separated \n\nafter one week. But yield was very low, only 15.4 %. The esterification reaction was also \n\ndone using sulphuric acid as catalyst, to have a \u201ccomplete\u201d esterification. The obtained yield \n\nwas 99.0 %. After these first experiments we decided to continue the work using \n\n[BMIM][HSO4] as catalyst:  because, this IL is one of the best ILs which have the higher \n\nyield and with this ILs have a study which continue in this work [Alimova, 2016]. Also, after \n\nesterification, a separation phase was faster than using other ILs. \n\nSeveral experiments were made using [BMIM][HSO4] as catalyst and the percentage of IL \n\nwas varied (10%, 15% and 20%). Acidity of oleic acid was a 183.7482, reaction time 6 h, \n\nreaction temperature 90oC. In Table 10 presented the results. \n\n Table 10.

In Figure \n\n23 is presented a picture of the biodiesel obtained in these reactions. The biodiesel has a \n\nyellow color. \n\n \n\nFigure 23. Biodiesel which we got from this reaction \n\n \n\n5.2 Internal Standard characterization \n \n\nThe quantification of the ester and linoleic acid methyl ester content in biodiesel samples \n\ncan be performed using the European Standard EN 14103 (April 2003). The methodology \n\nproposed implies the use of methyl heptadecanoate (minimum purity of 99%) as internal \n\nstandard for GC analysis (10 mg/mL in heptane). However, since the solid available for this \n\nwork has a purity of 97.5%, it was decided to study if this standard can add some impurities \n\nto biodiesel samples analysis. \n\nThe GC chromatogram obtained for the methyl heptadecanoate solution (10 mg/mL) is \n\npresented in Figure 24. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n \n\n  \nFigure 24. GC chromatogram obtained for the methyl heptadecanoate solution (10 mg/mL). Both \nfigures represent the same chromatogram (right figure used to visual identify the main peaks in \n\nbaseline). \n\nFrom the right amplified chromatogram we can see three main impurities (peak area above \n\n10000) present in the standard solution. With this analysis it was possible to obtain the \n\npurity for the internal standard solution of 99.2% (higher than the value indicated in the \n\nlabel of the reagent flask, ?97.5%). This value was obtained by the ratio of the area of \n\nmethyl heptadecanoate and the total area of all peaks having a minimum area of integration \n\nof 10000. This integration parameter as well as a signal to noise ratio of 1:5 was used for all \n\nthe biodiesel samples analysis, presented in the following sections. It was decided not to \n\nconsider all these impurities added by the internal standard in the quantification process for \n\nall the samples obtained in the recovery studies. The retention times of these non- identified \n\n(NI) peaks are 43.6, 45.3 and 77.4 min, for 1, 2 and 3, respectively. \n\n \n\n5.2.1 Complete esterification of Oleic Acid using sulfuric acid \n \n\nOther experimental task was the characterization of the oleic acid used as organic raw \n\nmaterial for the esterification reaction to produce biodiesel. This reagent was available with \n\na purity of ?90% and it was decided to measure the maximum quantity of methyl ester \n\nobtained by a \u201ccomplete\u201d esterification using sulfuric acid as catalyst. \n\nThe GC analysis of biodiesel sample obtained by esterification with sulfuric acid and \n\nanalyzed using the internal standard methodology is presented in Figure 25. \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n \n\n \nFigure 25. GC chromatogram obtained for the biodiesel sample obtained from esterification using \n\nsulfuric acid and with the addition of the internal standard. \n\n \n\nThe analysis of this chromatogram shows two main peaks: first the peak of the methyl ester \n\nof heptadecanoate, used as internal standard, and then the peak of oleate (from oleic acid) \n\nand elaidate (from elaidic acid) methyl esters that co-elute. There are also three small peaks \n\nthat represent the esterification of other fatty acids present in the original oleic acid reagent: \n\n(from palmitic, stearic and linoleic acids, respectively). The experimental concentration of \n\noleic acid methyl ester was 96.6% (g oleic methyl ester /g total fatty acid methyl esters). \n\n \n\n5.3 Characterization of biodiesel samples using different amounts of \nionic liquid \n\n \n\nTo study of the effect of the recovery of the [BMIM][HSO4] in the performance of the next \n\nesterification step, 3 esterification reactions (With 10%, 15% and 20% amounts of ILs) were \n\ncarried out followed by 4 (10% amount of IL) and 5 (15%, 20% amounts of IL) recovery \n\nsteps. For the first recovery only 4 reactions, because after fourth recovery of IL mass was \n\nvery small. The yields obtained for the reactions carried out with higher amounts of IL (15 \n\nwt% and 20 wt%) are higher than those obtained for the reactions with 10 wt% of IL.

This makes that ionic liquids are very \n\ninteresting solvents for spectroscopic measurements on dissolved metal salts and metal \n\ncomplexes. For the quality control of ionic liquids, UV/VIS spectrophotometry was applied. \n\nIt is an efficient method [Nockemann- 2005].  The effect of the recovery steps in the quality \n\nof the ionic liquid was studied by UV-VIS spectroscopy. The spectrum of original IL and \n\nthe ILs recovered after the final esterification reaction, for each %IL is presented in Figure \n\n31. The original ILs has a yellow colour, but the recovery ILs sample has a little bit dark \n\ncolour. In Figure 31, the absorption spectra of samples of the ionic liquid [BMIM][HSO4] \n\nare shown. The spectra were recorded in a 1 cm quartz cell. The absorption spectrum of the \n\noriginal ionic liquid (red, solid line) shows an absorption maximum around 260 nm.  \n\n \n\nFigure 31.

Conclusions and Future work \n\nThe effect of different reaction for biodiesel production was studied using different ionic \n\nliquid as a catalyst. The study of the esterification of oleic acid with ionic liquids was \n\ncarried out for obtaining high yield biodiesel production. For analyzing the biodiesel \n\nsamples was used a GC.  \n\nIn this dissertation different esterification reactions were carried out with different kind of \n\nILs.  The conversion varied between an 18 -88 %. For the study we selected [BMIM] \n\n[HSO4] ionic liquid. The reaction yield was found to be 76.6% to 10% IL, 83.3% to 15% IL \n\nand 84.8% to 20% IL. These yields decreased to 58.2% (10% IL) with 4 cycles of recycling, \n\n75.2% (15% IL) with 5 cycles of recycling and 77.1% (20% IL) with 5 cycles of recycling. \n\nIn this work the FAME content was calculated: values of around 50-60% of FAMEs / g \n\nbiodiesel sample. Another 40-50% could be in the organic phase (as acids) or in the aqueous \n\nphase. \n\nFor analyzing the ILs was used UV-VIS and FTIR. And found that it retained stable \n\ncatalytic performance after recovery. \n\n \n\nFuture work \n\nIn this thesis work, there are some further important researches that need to study. In this \n\ndissertation esterification reaction, were carried out for biodiesel production, using methanol \n\nand oleic acid and ILs as a catalyst. Though, in the future experiments will be testing other \n\nacids for biodiesel production.  \n\nThe IL ([BMIM] [HSO4]) recovery was.  Catalyst recovery was a 5 time (5 recycling). \n\nHowever, in the future experiments will be for improving conditions of recovery:  heating \n\ntime and temperature. Improve the recovery runs to increase 6-8 times.  And also in the \n\nfuture experiments will be testing other ILs for recovery. \n\nIn this work used GC analysis for biodiesel sample, and UV-VIS and FTIR for ILs analysis. \n\nBut in future have to be doing the FTIR analysis for oleic acid. And use more methods for \n\nanalysis. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n \n\nReferences \n\n\u2022 Abbaspour-Gilandeha E., Azim S.

Conclusions and Future work\n\tThe effect of different reaction for biodiesel production was studied using different ionic liquid as a catalyst. The study of the esterification of oleic acid with ionic liquids was carried out for obtaining high yield biodiesel production. For analyzing the biodiesel samples was used a GC. \n\tIn this dissertation different esterification reactions were carried out with different kind of ILs.  The conversion varied between an 18 -88 %. For the study we selected [BMIM] [HSO4] ionic liquid. The reaction yield was found to be 76.6% to 10% IL, 83.3% to 15% IL and 84.8% to 20% IL. These yields decreased to 58.2% (10% IL) with 4 cycles of recycling, 75.2% (15% IL) with 5 cycles of recycling and 77.1% (20% IL) with 5 cycles of recycling. In this work the FAME content was calculated: values of around 50-60% of FAMEs / g biodiesel sample. Another 40-50% could be in the organic phase (as acids) or in the aqueous phase.\n\tFor analyzing the ILs was used UV-VIS and FTIR. And found that it retained stable catalytic performance after recovery.\n\tFuture work\n\tIn this thesis work, there are some further important researches that need to study. In this dissertation esterification reaction, were carried out for biodiesel production, using methanol and oleic acid and ILs as a catalyst. Though, in the future experiments will be testing other acids for biodiesel production. \n\tThe IL ([BMIM] [HSO4]) recovery was.  Catalyst recovery was a 5 time (5 recycling). However, in the future experiments will be for improving conditions of recovery:  heating time and temperature. Improve the recovery runs to increase 6-8 times.  And also in the future experiments will be testing other ILs for recovery.\n\tIn this work used GC analysis for biodiesel sample, and UV-VIS and FTIR for ILs analysis. But in future have to be doing the FTIR analysis for oleic acid. And use more methods for analysis.\n\tReferences\n\tAppendix"}]}}}
