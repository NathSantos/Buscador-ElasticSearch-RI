However, the role of corticosteroids in fish reproduction can \n\nbe either positive or deleterious, depending on many variables. In the Astyanax genus, the \n\nsame stress stimulus can successfully induce the reproduction in Astyanax altiparanae, but \n\nnot in other species of the same genus. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze cortisol \n\nand progestogens plasma levels and receptor gene expression in the ovaries of A. altiparanae, \n\na teleost species that successfully reproduce using crowding and water level drawdown as \n\nstimulus. Three experimental groups were considered: Stress (high stocking density and water \n\nlevel drawdown); human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, a positive control); and Saline (a \n\ncontrol group). Females were sampled at three different moments of the artificial reproduction \n\nexperiment, initial, intermediary and at spawning. Indices of spawning performance as, \n\nfertilization rate, Gonadosomatic Index (GSI), as well as histological analysis of the ovaries \n\nwere carried out. 17?-hydroxiprogesterone (17 OHP) and cortisol (CORT) levels were \n\nmeasured in plasma by ELISA. Additionally, the ovarian gene expression of CORT and 17 \n\nOHP receptors (CR and PR) were carried out by Real-time quantitative PCR. Females from \n\nStress and hCG groups released a larger volume of eggs when compared with females from \n\nthe Saline (Control) group. Females from Stress group presented a decrease in GSI and \n\novaries mass at spawning, and many post ovulatory follicles (POFs) were present in the \n\novaries after spawning. At the intermediary sampling, plasma levels of CORT increased in \n\nfemales from the Stress group, but not in the hCG and Saline groups. 17 OHP levels did not \n\nchange during the experiment. PR gene was more expressed in females from hCG group \n\nthroughout the experiment, but CR gene expression did not change.

CR and \n\nPR did not seem to be the candidates for triggering ovulation, so the relationship between the \n\nderivative of progesterone (17,20DHP) should be deeper studied, as well as the role of CORT \n\nand different progestagens in A. altiparanae reproduction. \n\nResumo \n\nO estresse pode ser definido como uma condi\u00e7\u00e3o na qual o equil\u00edbrio din\u00e2mico do corpo \u00e9 \n\nperturbado e muitos estudos t\u00eam demonstrado a a\u00e7\u00e3o de alguns corticosteroides modulando \n\nsitua\u00e7\u00f5es de stress, tal como a reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o. No entanto, o papel dos corticosteroides na \n\nreprodu\u00e7\u00e3o de peixes pode ser positivo ou delet\u00e9rio, dependendo de muitas vari\u00e1veis. No \n\ng\u00eanero Astyanax, o mesmo est\u00edmulo de estresse pode induzir com sucesso a reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o em \n\nA.altiparanae, mas n\u00e3o em outras esp\u00e9cies do mesmo g\u00eanero. Portanto, o objetivo deste \n\nestudo foi analisar os n\u00edveis de cortisol e progest\u00e1genos no plasma e a express\u00e3o dos \n\nreceptoresdestes esteroides nos ov\u00e1rios de A. altiparanae, esp\u00e9cie de tele\u00f3steo que consegue \n\nse reproduzir com sucesso usando o aumento da densidade e varia\u00e7\u00e3o no n\u00edvel da \u00e1gua como \n\num est\u00edmulo. Tr\u00eas grupos experimentais foram considerados: Estresse (alta densidade de \n\nestocagem e intenso fluxo de \u00e1gua); Gonadotropina Cori\u00f4nica Humana (hCG, um controle \n\npositivo); e Salina (grupo controle). As f\u00eameas foram amostradas em tr\u00eas diferentes \n\nmomentos do experimento de reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o artificial, inicial, intermedi\u00e1rio e na desova. \u00cdndices \n\nde desempenho de desova como, taxa de fertiliza\u00e7\u00e3o, \u00cdndice Gonadossom\u00e1tico (IGS), bem \n\ncomo a an\u00e1lise histol\u00f3gica dos ov\u00e1rios foram considerados. Os n\u00edveis de 17?-\n\nhydroxiprogesterone (17OHP) e cortisol (CORT) foram medidos em amostras de plasma por \n\nELISA. Al\u00e9m disso, a express\u00e3o de genes de receptores de CORT (CR) e 17 OHP (PR) foram \n\nanalisadas nos ov\u00e1rios por qPCR. F\u00eameas dos grupos Estresse e hCGdesovaram um volume \n\nmaior de ovos quando comparadas\u00e0s f\u00eameas do grupo Salina (controle). As f\u00eameas do grupo \n\nEstresse apresentaram tamb\u00e9m uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o nos valores doIGS e na massa dos ov\u00e1rios no \n\nmomento da desova, e muitos fol\u00edculos p\u00f3s - ovulat\u00f3rios estavam presentes nos ov\u00e1rios ap\u00f3s a \n\ndesova. Na amostragem do per\u00edodo intermedi\u00e1rio, os n\u00edveis plasm\u00e1ticos de CORT \n\naumentaram nas f\u00eameas do grupo de Estresse, mas n\u00e3o nos grupos de hCG e Salina. A \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o de 17OHP n\u00e3o se alterou durante o experimento ou entre os grupos. O PR foi \n\nmais expresso em f\u00eameas do grupo hCG ao longo do experimento, e a express\u00e3o do CR n\u00e3o \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nse alterou. Sugerimos um poss\u00edvel papel de CORT como um agente indutor na ovula\u00e7\u00e3o e / ou \n\nde desova de A. altiparanae .No entanto, CR e PR n\u00e3o parecem ser os candidatos para \n\ndesencadear a ovula\u00e7\u00e3o, de modo que a rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre receptores derivadosPR (17,20DHP) \n\ndevem ser mais profundamente estudados, bem como a efetiva a\u00e7\u00e3o de CORT e diferentes \n\nprogest\u00e1genos na reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o de A. altiparanae.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nABBREVIATIONS USED IN THIS STUDY \n# \n\n \n17?,20?

Once the animal has reached the minimum biological conditions to start \n\nit, the external stimuli are received by receptor organs, converted into electrochemical \n\nsignals, and then, they stimulate the synthesis and release of many hormones, including the \n\ngonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), the key neurohormone controlling the \n\nHypothalamus-Pituitary-Gonads (HPG) axis in fish, which stimulates the pituitary \n\ngonadotropic cells to initiate the synthesis and release of FSH (follicle-stimulating \n\nhormone) initiating the process that leads the conversion of cholesterol to testosterone \n\n(Millaet al., 2009). This process, modulated mainly by GnRH is also mediated by \n\nkisspeptin (KiSS), the product of the gene Kiss1, also a key hormone in the regulation of \n\nreproductive functions in fish (Zohar et al., 2010). \n\nWhen environmental conditions and the combined hormonal stimuli lead the \n\nreproductive cycle without inhibitory effects, testosterone is transported to the granular \n\ncells, and aromatized to 17?-estradiol (E2), which acts in the hepatocytes, stimulating the \n\nsynthesis of vitellogenin, a phospholipoglycoproteins, which via the bloodstream, is \n\ncaptured by the oocytes via micropinocitosis, thus promoting growth of the oocyte and the \n\nincorporation of the yolk. In response to a sharp production of E2, there is a negative \n\nfeedback to FSH and together with the action of GnRH stimulates the secretion of LH, \n\nwhich, once bounded to its receptors in the granulosa cells, initiating the process of final \n\nmaturation and ovulation (Lubzenset al., 2010). \n\nThis whole cycle can be regarded as a very sensitive stage to environmental stimuli \n\nand may even present differences according to the stress levels of individuals that have \n\nundergone variants, such as reproductive migration in some species, temperature, \n\nphotoperiod or rainfall that can reduce circulating levels of sex steroid hormones. The \n\nstimuli capable of generating high levels of stress can also produce different responses in \n\ndifferent stages of maturation, affecting the quality of gametes and influencing the \n\noffspring (Weedelar-Bonga, 1997; Lubzenset al., 2010 ). \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\nStress and reproduction \n\nAccording to Wendeelar-Bonga (1997), \u201cstress can be defined as a condition in \n\nwhich the dynamic equilibrium of the body, or homeostasis, is threatened or disturbed due \n\nto the stressors called stimulus action\u201d. The action of stressors is dual: they can produce \n\neffects that threat or disrupt the homeostatic balance, as may, however, cause a number of \n\nbehavioral and physiological responses as compensatory and / or adaptive action, enabling \n\nthe animal to overcome the threats. \n\nIf an animal is subjected to an intense and constant stress, the physiological \n\nresponse may lose its adaptive value, causing permanent damage to their health and well-\n\nbeing (Carmichael, 1984). The central adaptation to stress is the relocation of substrates for \n\nactivities that require enhancement to restore homeostasis, such as respiration, locomotion, \n\nhidromineral balance and tissue repair, instead of high energy demand activities such as \n\ngrowth and reproduction (Mommsen et al., 1999). Such dynamics can significantly reduce \n\nanimal performance, both during forward recovery phase to an acute stress and in chronic \n\nstress (Mommsen et al., 1999). Faced with such situation, an animal can quit a \n\nprogrammed step, such as reproduction, leading to immediate survival. This situation is \n\noften seen in fish farms where the maintenance of animals in captivity, management, \n\namong other routine activities may interfere with the reproductive performance of many \n\nspecies. As an example, the case of Anguilla anguilla, whose oocyte development is \n\nprevented in captivity (Milla et al., 2009). \n\nThe modulation of stress reactions is directly related to the action of corticosteroid \n\nhormones, and several studies have shown a possible duality of functions. Stressful \n\nsituations can inhibit the reproductive performance of fish (Small, 2004; Millaetal., 2009) \n\ncausing adverse effects in this process, due to the action on the HHG axis; for example, the \n\neffects of cortisol, the main corticosteroid in teleosts, in the production of gonadotropins \n\nand vitellogenesis (Small, 2004; Millaet al., 2009). When exposed to severe stressful \n\nsituations or long term, fish have disrupted their reproductive processes due to decreased \n\npituitary activity, especially in relation to the synthesis and release of FSH and LH \n\n(Carragheretal., 1989; Norris and Hobbs, 2006), and consequently to a decreased synthesis \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nof sex steroid hormones. This reduction in the concentration of steroids may occur due to \n\nthe competition for common substrate (cholesterol) of sex steroids and corticosteroids (Fig. \n\n1) (Pickering et al., 1987; Milla etal., 2009), and may also result in reducing the size of \n\neggs and quality of larvae (Campbell et al., 1994 Mylonasetal., 2010). In this sense, \n\nhormonal interference is needed to provide the final maturation and ovulation in teleosts, a \n\nroutine practice in fish farming (Zohar and Mylonas, 2001). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1: Synopses of the probable pathways of corticosteroid biosynthesis in female teleost. Solid black \n\narrows show that the enzyme catalyzing the steroid metabolism is active in the gonad; the grey arrows \n\nindicate that the enzyme required for that step is expressed in the gonad but its activity needs to be \n\nconfirmed. Unfilled arrow indicates lack of clear information. (Adapted by Millaet al., 2009). \n\n \n\nConversely, in cases such as eel (Anguilla anguilla) and rainbow trout \n\n(Oncorhynchusmykiss), glucocorticoids, hormones commonly associated with stress, were \n\nused to induce a LH peak in the early sexual maturation (Millaetal., 2009). In vitro studies \n\nhave shown the ability of corticosteroids to induce oocyte maturation in freshwater species \n\nsuch as catfish Heteropneustesfossilis, supporting the idea that corticosteroids can have \n\ndirect and / or indirect action to stimulate the final maturation (Rahman etal., 2001). \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\nThe role of steroid hormones in fish farming  \n\nThe attempt to make fish farming a more profitable activity and the need to \n\nunderstand the mechanisms behind reproductive impairment in cultivated species triggered \n\nmany studies trying to measure the influence of stress in the final stages of reproduction in \n\nteleost species in which disruptions in captive breeding have been reported (Millaetal., \n\n2009). Additionally, when in captive conditions (in fish farms), the natural challenges for \n\nfish are mainly related with the management imposed by the activity, such as the \n\nmaintenance and transportation of breeding/juveniles, prophylactic and/or effective \n\ntreatments, high densities of storage, among others. The sum of the physiological changes \n\ntriggered by chemical, physical and/or biological challenges, are commonly referred to as \n\nstress responses (Wedemeyeret al., 1990). In this context, the literature has shown that \n\nwithin fish farms, stressful situations, even though routine, such as the handling of animals, \n\ncan directly affect reproductive performance, the quality of spawning or even development \n\nof the progeny (Campbell et al., 1994). \n\nDiadromous fish species need to migrate in order to find a satisfactory \n\nenvironment to spawn. But, restricted in tanks, they need to be manipulated and in some \n\ncases, hormonal manipulations are necessary to trigger the final steps of the reproductive \n\ncycle. The investigations of these fish species are based mainly on the studies of the \n\nplasma profile of sex steroids, an information that according to some authors, could \n\nindicate a failure in the final maturation and consequently a dysfunction in the production \n\nof progestogens (Zohar and Mylonas, 2001; Baldisserotto and Gomes, 2005; Mylonasetal., \n\n2010). In this sense, hormonal therapies are required to provide the final maturation and \n\novulation in Neotropical migratory species. Thus, several recent studies have attempted to \n\nmeasure the influence of captivity during the reproductive cycle in Neotropical fish species \n\nwith blocked reproduction in captivity, mainly the potamodromous species, as \n\nProchiloduslineatus (Hainfellneret al., 2012; Souza et al., 2014), Salminushilarii (Honjiet \n\nal., 2011, 2013; Moreira et al., 2015), Steindachneridionparahybae(Honjiet al., 2013, \n\n2015) and Piaractusmesopotamicus (Kuradomiet al., 2015) among others. \n\n \n\nCorticosteroids receptors and reproduction \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\nIn some fish species, as eel and brown trout, glucocorticoids were used to induce \n\nLH synthesis at first sexual maturation, supporting the idea that corticosteroids may exert \n\ndirect and/or indirect action in stimulating the final maturation (Millaet al., 2009). This \n\nfeature is based on recent studies that point to a possible promiscuous action between \n\nprogestagen and glucocorticoid receptors (EickandThornton, 2011), which could establish \n\na link between understanding the mechanism of hormone action in ovulation and spawning \n\nof fish species in captivity, diminishing the use of synthetic hormones. Therefore, studies \n\nwith species in which reproductive response to stress conditions are positive become \n\ninteresting for understanding the mechanisms of adjusts of this animal, as well as the route \n\nof stimulation of ovulation by means of corticosteroids. Based on this context, there is a \n\nnative potamodromous fish species A. altiparanaethat is a good model for these studies, \n\nbecause crowding and/or water level drawdown stimulates ovulation and/or spawning in \n\nthis species (Chehadeet al., 2015), making possible the understanding of the relation \n\nbetween corticosteroids and reproduction in captivity teleost species, since studies with \n\nneotropical species are still scarce. \n\n \n\nExperimental species \n\nThe yellow tail \"lambari\", Astyanax altiparanae (Britski, 1964) Characiformes, \n\nCharacidae family, is considered one of the most important fish species in the food chain \n\nof the rivers of South America, where it plays a secondary role in relation to those \n\nidentified as noble species (for example: Pseudoplatystomacorruscans, \n\nPseudoplatystomafasciatus, Salminusbrasiliensis, Bryconamazonicus, Brycon insignis, \n\namong others) (Baldisserotto and Gomes, 2005). This species belongs to a large group of \n\nmigratory species, which represents the largest number of fish species in Brazil (Britski, \n\n1972). The genus Astyanax can be considered the most representative of the \n\nTetragonopterinae subfamily, being dominant in South America, with approximately a \n\nhundred species (Garutti and Britski, 2000). \n\nThis genus, in general, is composed by reophilic species that are small and \n\ncharacterized by having small oocytes, high relative fecundity, rapid development, external \n\nfertilization and no parental care (Suzuki et al., 2005). A. altiparanae is known by the high \n\nbiological plasticity, and is becoming a potential fish model for scientific studies about \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\nreproduction and stress modulation, since it presents satisfactory results for reproduction in \n\nconditions considered stressful for other species within the same genus. A. \n\naltiparanaefemales can be induced to ovulation by water level drawdown and \n\nconsequently increasing stocking density (Chehadeet al., 2015). Considering that cortisol \n\nlevels increase at stressing situations and the known fact of receptor promiscuity between \n\ncorticosteroids and progestogens, we hypothesize that this ovulation/spawning protocol can \n\nbe considered a stressor in A. altiparanae females, triggering cortisol release and that, this \n\ncorticosteroid can act as the Maturation Induction Steroid (MIS) in A. altiparanae, binding \n\nto progesterone receptors (PR). \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\nObjectives \n\n \n\nThe main objective of this study is to gain some expertise on the main \n\nphysiological steps involved in A. altiparanae reproduction, in which a supposed stress \n\nsituation triggers ovulation and spawning. This information is important in the fields of \n\nreproductive physiology, genetics and endocrinology of reproduction, which are important \n\nareas of fish breeding technology that still needs to be developed in Brazil. \n\n \n\n2.1 Specific objectives: \n\n\u2022 Evaluate the reproductive performance of A. altiparanae, using different \n\nartificial reproduction protocols, including crowding as the ovulation inducer; \n\n\u2022 Evaluate the role of corticosteroids and progestogens during the artificial \n\nreproduction of A. altiparanae; \n\n\u2022 Evaluate the role of corticosteroid and progestogens receptors in triggering \n\novulation and spawning in A. altiparanae. \n\n  \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nMATERIAL AND METHODOS \n\n \n\nExperimental procedure for captive breeding of Astyanax altiparanae \n\n \n\nThe experimental design was carried out at the Fish Farm of the Electric Company of \n\nS\u00e3o Paulo - CESP, Paraibuna (S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil) (Fig.2). In December and January 2013 we \n\nsampled adult males and females (Fig.3) of A. altiparanae, born, raised and collected in tanks \n\nin the Hydrobiology and Aquaculture Unit of CESP. Broodstocks were kept in 4 tanks \n\n(200m2), fed with commercial diet with 15% of crude protein, distributed in the amount of \n\n1.5% of the total biomass per day, divided in two daily treatments (morning and afternoon), 3 \n\ntimes a week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) throughout the year. During the experiment, \n\nin January 2013, 225 males and 155 females with total length of 12 to 16 cm and body mass \n\nof 34 to 45g were selected in nurseries by trawl and transported with buckets and aerators to \n\nindoor tanks with 0.86m\u00b3 located in the laboratory, according to the method described by \n\nChehadeet al., (2015) for induced spawning. It should be emphasized here that theprocedures \n\nto sacrifice performed in this study are according to the protocol 171/2012, the Institute of \n\nBiosciences of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo Animal Ethics Committee. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2: Fish Farm used for the experiments- Paraibuna - CESP. \n\n \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe animals were divided into three tanks of 865 L (0.86m\u00b3) (75 males and 50 \n\nfemales/tank) supplied at a flow rate of 10L of water/minute. At the time of distribution of \n\nanimals in experimental tanks, an initial sampling was carried out (time 0h) of 5 females, free \n\nof any hormonal or manipulative action. The experiment was divided into initial sampling of \n\nbiological material (0h induction time of reproduction), 8h (initial), 12h (intermediate) and \n\n24h after induction (spawning) calculated based on the previously knowledge of spawning \n\ntiming of the group induced to spawn by water level drawdown (Chehadeet al., 2015). After \n\nthe initial sampling of females, the animals were divided in the tanks and given the following \n\ntreatments: \n\n-Stress (E): for animals whose spawning was performed only by a high density \n\nstimulus, coupled with the increased water flow into the tanks being supplied by a \n\nrecirculation of 10 liters per minute, while the water level in the tank was kept low (water \n\nlevel drawdown). This group corresponds to the protocol routinely successfully developed at \n\nCESP; \n\n-hCG (H): animals with a spawning protocol associated with hormonal stimulation \n\nwith human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), without interference from high density as the \n\nwater volume of the tank was not lowered and the water flow was not incremented; \n\n-Saline (S):the animals underwent the same manipulation of injections, but containing \n\nphysiological saline (0.9% NaCl). \n\n \n\nThe hCG (Ovidrel\u00a9) was administered in females from the H group in the \n\nconcentration of 5UI/g as a single dose in the lower region of the pectoral fin, quickly, not \n\nFigure 3: Female of Astyanax altiparanae (total length). \n\n \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nallowing the animal to remain for a long period out of the water. The application was about \n\ntwelve hours (12h) after the beginning of the experimental group E, due to the faster action of \n\nthis glycoprotein. The saline was applied to the females of S group, in the same region of the \n\nfin, using the same volume used for hCG (180\u00b5L/female). Soon after this procedure, all the \n\nfemales were placed in their tanks, together with the males. During the period of twenty four \n\nhours after the induction, females were collected in each experimental group, respecting the \n\nproposed periods (initial, intermediate and spawning), to be possible to follow the time of \n\novulation in the females from the different groups. The males did not receive any treatment, \n\nsince they produce sperm in captivity. \n\nAfter spawning, the eggs were siphoned from the tank bottom to be quantified and \n\ntransferred to conical incubators (200L), with 1620 liters per hour of water circulation. After \n\nhatching, the larvae were maintained for a few days in the incubators until they were \n\ntransferred to the outdoor tanks (200 m2). To assess the viability of the eggs in each \n\nexperimental group three aliquots of eggs were collected per group to estimate the percentage \n\nof fertilized eggs (number of fertilized eggs x 100/ total number of eggs) (Vazzoler, 1996). To \n\nmeasure the amount of eggs, they were siphoned, allocated in 1L beakers, allowed to separate \n\nthe water phase, and then, the number of eggs were counted in subsamples and extrapolated \n\nfor the total volume of water. To calculate the efficiency of each treatment, a calculation was \n\nperformed based on the values obtained in the fertilization rate (average weigh between the \n\nvalues obtained on the fertilization rate) plus the standard deviation within the group. \n\n \n\nMonitoring the physicochemical parameters of water \n\nTo ensure that the water conditions were established during the experiment, pH, \n\ndissolved oxygen, temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS) were monitored throughout the \n\nexperiment to exclude a possible abiotic interference on the results. Data were collected over \n\nthe 24 hour experiment with a Multiparameter probe (YSI, Pro Plus) and the pH was \n\nmonitored with a pH meter Gehaka. \n\n \n\nSampling \n\nAt the time of each sampling (initial, intermediate and final), the animals were \n\nanaesthetized with benzocaine (1g benzocaine in ethanol 92%), which solution was then \n\ndiluted with 10L water. After anesthesia, the blood was collected from the caudal vasculature \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\n(Fig. 4) using disposable 1 ml syringes, heparinized (Hepamax\u00a9) and centrifuged for five \n\nminutes at 3000 rpm to separate plasma from the cellular fraction of blood. \n\n \nFigure 4 - Blood collected from the caudal vasculature of A. altiparanae. \n\n \n\nPlasma was aliquoted in eppendorfsand frozen in liquid nitrogen until transportation to \n\na -800C freezer. After blood collection, fish were measured, weighed, the ovaries were \n\nremoved (Fig. 5) and weighed to calculate the gonadosomatic index GSI = (total mass of the \n\novaries / total body weight) x 100] (Vazzoler, 1996). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5: Ovaries collected at the beginning and after 24 hour of the experiment. \n\n \n\nAfter this procedure, a sample of the middle third of the ovarian lobes were collected \n\nand fixed in Bouin's solution to ascertain the presence of postovulatory follicles (POF) and \n\nother stages of development of gametes. The histological method (i.e., the presence of POF) \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\nwas used as a tool to calculate the percentage of the response to ovulation with the different \n\ninduction protocols. A small piece of ovary was also collected and conserved in RNAlater, in \n\na ratio of \u00bd centimeter of animal tissue, dipped in 10 ml RNAlater to be used in the molecular \n\nanalysis. \n\n \n\nHormonal analysis \n\nThe gonadal steroid 17?-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) and cortisol (CORT) were \n\nmeasured in A. altiparanaeplasma by the method of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay \n\n(ELISA) using a commercial kit (IBL\u00ae). Afterwards, a plasma extraction protocol, separating \n\nthe protein and lipid fractions (to use only the lipid fraction, which contains the steroid \n\nhormones) was applied. Various dilutions were initially tested to ensure that the values \n\nobtained for both hormones fit the kit standard curve. To perform the extraction, the samples \n\nwere removed from the -80\u00b0C freezer, plasma proteins were precipitated with ethyl ether in \n\nthe ratio 1:3 (plasma: ethyl ether) and centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 9 minutes at 40C. \n\nImmediately, after being centrifuged, the samples were placed in the -80\u00b0C freezer for 7 \n\nminutes to ensure that all the protein was decanted. Finally, the supernatant was transferred to \n\nanother clean tube, dried with nitrogen and kept at 4\u00b0C until use. After the tests, a dilution \n\nfactor was established for each hormone, 1: 4 for CORT and 1: 3 for 17 OHP. The steroid \n\nanalysis was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, using plasma samples in \n\nduplicate. The plates were read in a Spectra Max 250 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices) \n\nat a wavelength of 450nm. \n\n \n\nHistological analyses of ovaries \n\nWe removed the gonads from the fish, fixed them for 20-24 hours in Bouin's solution, \n\nand dehydrated them with an increasing series of ethanol dilutions. Subsequently, the ovaries \n\nwere transferred to xylene (dimethyl benzene) and infiltrated with Paraplast (View Plast, \n\nErviegas Surgical Instruments Ltd.), following the methodology proposed by Behmeret al., \n\n(1976). Then 5\u00b5m sections were performed with a microtome (Leica RM / 2255 equipped \n\nwith support for disposable blades) and mounted on slides with polylysine(Poly Lysine \n\nSolution INS Sigma Diagnostics, St. Louis MO USA.) diluted at 1: 5 in distilled water, to \n\nassist the fixing of the cutting blades. Ovaries sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, \n\nand then again dehydrated and finished with cover slip and Damar gum. We analyzed and \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\ndocumented the prepared sections in a computerized system for image capturing (transmitted \n\nlight microscope - Leica DM 1000; camera - Leica DFC 295, and image capture program - \n\nLeica Application Suite Professional, LAS V3.6). \n\nA pattern was established using four fields of view in each set of four sections per \n\nslide in a total of five blades per animal for analysis, a total of eighty fields of view per \n\nanimal. The sections were analyzed and documented, using a computerized image capture \n\n(transmitted light microscope Leica DM 1000, equipped with camera Leica DFC 295, and \n\nimage capture program Leica Application Suite Professional, LAS V3 .6). From the \n\ndistribution and observed cell types, we assembled a table to identify/quantify the maturity \n\nstage of groups throughout the experiment. This method was performed according to  \n\nGomeset al., (2014). For each symbol (+) added, giving a greater frequency of a cell type, \n\nobserved within the group, at different times throughout the experiment, as follows: (-) \n\nabsent; (+) present; (++) frequent;(+++) predominantly, to cells observed in the fields \n\nanalyzed in the respective group. The classifications of gamete maturation stages as well as \n\nthe identification of postovulatory follicles were performed according to Grier (2007). \n\n \n\nMolecular analysis \n\nAssuming that there was no previous data about the target genes (Cortisol and \n\nProgesterone receptors) in A. altiparanae, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for \n\namplification of receptors of cortisol (CR) and progesterone (PR) cDNA from A. altiparanae \n\nwas performed using degenerate primers (more details about the techniques on the annex \n\nsection). For this goal, we used the preserved tissue on RNAlater to extract DNA and \n\nestimated which species could be close enough to start the analysis. The molecular techniques \n\ndescribed below were initiated at Dr. Carlos Strussmann\u2019s laboratory, at the Department of \n\nApplied Marine Bioscience, at Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology, Japan \n\n(FAPESP/BEPE 2013/26563-1). The analysis was carried out using GENETYX\u00a9, an analysis \n\nprogram responsible for selecting species for alignment, and creation of BLAST (Fig. 6). \n\nBased on this program, we designed the degenerate primers for the CR based on the \n\nnucleotide sequences of Salmotrutta (accession number: AY863149), Danio rerio (access \n\nnumber: BX276106), Astyanax mexicanus (access number: XM_007247018.1) and \n\nDicentrarchuslabrax (accession number: AY619996). \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6: GENETYX\u00a9 choosing the closest sequences for alignment, separating by size and percentage \n\nmatch for analyses with Cortisol receptor. \n\n \n\n Considering that the sequence of nitrogenous bases for CR is very conserved among \n\nspecies, compatible species were found in the BLAST genetic alignment. The same situation \n\nwas found for Beta-Actin, where Danio rerio and Odonthestesbonariensis (access number: \n\nEF026002.1 and EF044319.1 respectively) where used to design the primers. Unlike the \n\ngenes mentioned above, the PR was relatively complex, since the number of inserts present in \n\nthe sequence provided sixty four combinations failures before of functional primers for \n\nreceptor I, show magnification in the samples. For PR we used an alignment among Anguilla \n\njaponica (AB032075), Danio rerio (NM_001166335) and Astyanax mexicanus \n\n(XM_007231093). Otherwise, for the receptor associated with the MIS (Maturation Inducing \n\nSteroid), 17?-20? DHP (17?,20?- dihidroxy-4-pregnen-3-one), the alignment showed a \n\ncommon profile among the species, to be more conserved than the Receptor I. We used the \n\nfollowing species: Carassiusglibelio (Access number: AB934933), Danio rerio (Access \n\nnumber: FJ409244), Astyanax mexicanus (Access number XM_007231093). After analysis \n\nwith the GENETYX\u00a9 program, we have chosen the degenerate primer sequence for the PCR, \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\nusing the conserved areas of the alignment map to drawn possible consistent sequences for the \n\nPCR (Fig. 7). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7: Alignment made by GENETYX\u00a9 for Astyanax altiparanaeprogesterone receptor. \n\n \n\nUsing the computer program for alignment and genomic analyses, Genetix\u00a9, the best \n\nregions were chosen and the sequence for the primers was designed. The functional primers is \n\ndescribed below (Table 1). For CR gene we designed two sequences named DGCRfw1 and \n\nDGCRfw2, sequences forward and one reverse named DGCRrv1. For PR gene, we designed \n\ntwo combinations of forward and reverse primers (Forward/Reverse A and Forward and \n\nReverse B) that gave us results. To study the MIS receptor, we designed two forwards and \n\none reverse primer named MIH Forward/Reverse A. For Beta-actin gene, used as a reference \n\ngene, we designed primer sequences of Forward and Reverse named Beta forward/reverse. \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1: Degenerated primers used for the target genes in PCR analyses. \n\nPrimer name Sequence forward Sequence reverse \n\nDGCRfw1 TGTGGCAGCTGCAAGGTCTTCTT - \n\nDGCRfw2 GCCTTATGACCACCCTCAACA - \n\nDGCRrv1 - TGCCGGTTCTGGCTGGAGTTC \n\nForward A AGTTCTGACCTGCGGAAGCTGC  \n\nReverse A - CTCATCTCGTCAAACTGGCCCTGACTCT \n\nForward B ATCCACGATGCAGTCGTTTC  \n\nMIH Forward A TGCTACCAGGCAGGGATGATC  \n\nMIH Reverse A - CCACTCCTTTCTCCTTTA \n\nBeta-\n\nactinForward \n\nCAAGGCCAACAGGGAAAA  \n\nBeta-actin \n\nReverse \n\n- TCTCTGCCAGCCAGATCC \n\n \n\nThe polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a rapid procedure allowing the in vitro \n\namplification of specific fragments of DNA, starting from a minimal amount of target DNA \n\nor RNA converted to cDNA previously.

In addition, DNA \n\npolymerase is necessary, dNTPs, buffer, and salts (MgCl).

The addition of fluorescent dye (ethidium bromide or SYBR\u00ae), which \n\nintercalates between the bases of DNA and the use of ultraviolet radiation allow visualization \n\nand photography (Souza, 2003). After checking the result, we cut the bands and made \n\npurification of the genetic material. This technique permitted separation, identification and \n\npurification of DNA molecules, preparing for cloning and sequence step (details for the \n\nprotocols on annex 1,2 and 3). The molecular cloning is by definition, the diffusion of \n\nidentical DNA molecules and is based on natural propagation or cell genetically identical to \n\nthe original individuals.  \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\nThe experiment of gene cloning is to introduce the gene into bacterial cells and isolate \n\nthem in colonies (Nascimento et al., 1999). In the first step there was the link between a DNA \n\nfragments called insert, containing the gene of interest with another DNA molecule, the \n\nvector. In the second step, the recombinant DNA molecule was transported into a host cell, \n\nusually a bacterium, where the transformation process takes place. The cell that received the \n\nrecombinant DNA is called transformed cell which undergoes many cycles of division to \n\nproduce multiple copies of the recombinant DNA. The procedure described followed the \n\ncommercial kits for purification, ligation, transformation and cloning adapted by Promega\u00ae \n\nindustrial protocol.  \n\nFor ligation and after transformation, the manufacturing process consisted in \n\nintroducing an exogenous DNA into host cells can be bacteria, most commonly used bacterial \n\ncell is Escherichia coli cell (Brown, 2003). For this project, we used the pGEM\u00ae-T Easy \n\nVector. All vector models for cloning contain three common features: selective brand, origin \n\nof replication and multiple cloning sites. The selective mark refers to genes that confer \n\nresistance to antibiotics and provide selection of transformed clones those unprocessed. For \n\nthis selection it was added to the culture medium appropriate antibiotic in concentrations \n\nwhich enable to differentiate (sensitive to the antibiotic) non-transformed cell of the \n\ntransformed cell (antibiotic-resistant). \n\nThe procedure for ligation and transformation are briefly described below. Additional \n\ndetails are present on the annex pages. \n\n \n\n \n\nREACTION COMPONENT STANDARD \n\nREACTION \n\nPOSITIVE \n\nCONTROL \n\nBACKGROUND \n\nCONTROL \n\n2x Rapid Ligation Buffer, T4 DNA Ligase 5\u00b5 l 5\u00b5 l 5\u00b5 l \n\npGEM\u00ae- T Easy Vector (50ng) 1\u00b5 l 1\u00b5 l 1\u00b5 l \n\nPCR product X\u00b5 l - - \n\nControl insert DNA - 2\u00b5 l - \n\nT4 DNA Ligase (3 Weiss units/\u00b5 l) 1\u00b5 l 1\u00b5 l 1\u00b5 l \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\n \n\n1.

Alternatively, if the maximum number of \n\ntransformants is required, incubate the reactions overnight at 4\u00b0C.  \n\n \n\nTransformation \n\nWe prepared two LB/ampicillin/IPTG/ X-Gal plates to each ligation reaction,plus two \n\nplates for determining transformation efficiency (pos and background control). The plates was \n\nequilibrated to room temperature prior to plating. The tubes were centrifuged containing the \n\nligation reactions to collect contents at the bottom of the tube. Add 2\u00b5 l of each ligation \n\nreaction to a sterile 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube on ice. We Set up another tube on ice with \n\n0.1ng uncut plasmid for determination of the transformation efficiency of the competent cells. \n\nSo, we removed the tube(s) of frozen JM109 High Efficiency Competent Cells from -70\u00b0C \n\nstorage and placed them in an ice bath until just thawed (about 5 minutes). Mixed the cells by \n\ngently flicking the tube. Avoid excessive pippeting, as the competent cells are extremely \n\nfragile. Carefully we transfered 50\u00b5 l of cells into each tube prepared  (100\u00b5 l cells for \n\ndetermination of transformation efficiency). (Avoid excessive pipetting, as the cells are very \n\nfragile). Gently flicked the tubes to mix and place them on ice for 20 minutes.

The plates were incubated overnight (16-24 hours) at 37\u00b0C. Longer \n\nincubations or storage plates at 4\u00b0C (after 37\u00b0C overnight incubation) were used to facilitate \n\nblue color development (Fig. 11). White colonies generally contain inserts; however, inserts \n\nmay also be present in blue colonies. White clones were picked up by sterile tooth-picker into \n\nuniversal tube with 5ml LB plus Ampicillin (final concentration 100\u00b5 g/ml) media, incubated \n\novernight at 37C, 150rpm.

The master plate should was incubated for \n\n16~24hours. Then, the sample was homogenized and after, put on the heat bath at 95\u00b0C for \n\n1~5 minutes. This proceeds made sure that the bacteria cell was broken. Then, we used this \n\nmaterial to run a PCR for confirmation for all samples you are cultivating (Fig. 12).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 12: Results for the PCR to confirm the efficiency of the inserts for CR in Astyanax altiparanae. \n\n \n\nAfter confirming the insertion, the master plate was incubated overnight, and then the \n\ncolonies removed with a tip for 10 ~100 \u00b5 l, in a sterile tube with 2~3ml of liquid media. \n\nThen, the samples were incubated in a heat bath/shaker for 16~24hours at 37\u00b0C and 136 rpm. \n\nAfter this period, the samples were ready to be purified and sent for sequence in a specialized \n\nindustry. The protocol used for purification is described on the annex (annex 6).  \n\n \n\nReal-time quantitative PCR \n\nThe real-time quantitative PCR primers for PR and CR receptors genes (forward and \n\nreverse) were designed using the software Perl Primer v1.1.17. The gene efficiency was \n\noptimized to be between 95 and 105% using the standard curve with five different dilutions of \n\na pool of cDNA samples from all experimental animals. The real time PCR was performed \n\nusing 1X SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.2 uM primer (forward and \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\nreverse) and an equivalent of 5 ng cDNA. The reaction was incubated for 2 min at 50 \u00b0 C, 10 \n\nmin at 95 \u00b0 C followed by forty cycles of 15 sec at 95 \u00b0 C and 40 s at 60 \u00b0 C. At the end of \n\nthese cycles an analysis of the melt curve was carried out to test the specificity of the reaction. \n\nThe reaction was performed in triplicate in a thermocycler ExicyclerTM96 through Exicycler \n\nDiagnosis3 software. The EF1? gene was used as an endogenous reference gene for analyzing \n\nthe relative expression of target genes. Gene expression was calculated using the Ct value, \n\nwhich was normalized by a reference sample (cDNA pool), standardized by EF1?.  \n\nStatistical analyses  \n\nData of plasma concentration of steroid hormones were expressed as mean \u00b1standard \n\nerror of the mean (SEM). Comparisons of steroid plasma levels and relative gene expression \n\nof CR and PR among the experimental groups (stress, saline and hCG) in A. altiparanaewere \n\nperformed by analysis of variance (ANOVA One Way) considering the time of the experiment \n\n(initial, intermediate or spawning). Tukey was used as a post-hoc test. The analyses were \n\nperformed using the Sigma Stat (version 3.5) software. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\nResults \n\n \n\n \n The experiments carried out  were divided into two parts: \n\nIn the first part, we describe the results obtained on the hormonal profile and histological \n\nanalysis, it showed the efficiency of the induction protocol, considering the results of the \n\nspawning females in the stress group. For these analyzes, the cortisol assay results showed \n\nstatistical significance, while the histological examination revealed the presence of mature \n\ncells and then to experiment, the presence of post-ovulatory follicles in two of the three \n\ngroups, confirming the expected in the drawing trial \n\n \n\nIn the second part of this work, we performed a molecular analysis of CR and PR in cells \n\nfrom the ovaries. These results aimed to elucidate the expression of Membrane receptor \n\nsignaling for CR and PR, and Beta-actin in A. altiparanae. \n\nIn conventional PCR, the results were obtained using beta-actin gene as a normalizer. \n\nHowever, for the RT PCR analysis, the gene set for use, due to better results in the \n\noptimization tests, was Ef1a. The results showed statistical difference for the gene expression \n\nof the related Progestin receptor. \n\n \n\nReproductive performance \n\n Regarding the behavior of the animals, there was a period of approximately 24hours \n\nfrom the beginning of the experiment, when it was observed the pairing of animals in the \n\nStress group, a behavior that was followed by the positive response in all experimental \n\ngroups. Taking into account the results obtained in the morphological analysis and the values \n\nof GSI, it can be inferred that animals from the Stress group ovulated in the period that \n\ncomprised the second half of the experiment, responding rapidly to stress controlled, which \n\nmay be considered a positive result to the proposed protocol. The values of GSI and gonad \n\nmass decreased significantly (P&lt;0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively) in the animals from the \n\nStress group at the time of spawning. The body mass did not change in any experimental \n\ngroup (Table 2). The fertilization rate of the eggs did not vary in females from the different \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\nexperimental groups (P = 0.518)and the percentage of responses remained unchanged (P = \n\n0.346) (Table 3). \n\n \n\nTable 2: Body and gonadal weight, and GSI Astyanax altiparanae females of different experimentalgroups \n(mean \u00b1 standard deviation).

The analysis of water \n\nquality parameters showed no statistical differences among the three experimental groups for \n\nTDS (P = 0.398), dissolved oxygen (P = 0.519) and temperature (P = 0.436) values, that were \n\nnot statistically different (ANOVA). \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\nThe results can be explained by the different procedures used in each experimental \n\ngroup, as the case of reducing the the water pH in the tank of animals from the Stress \n\ngroup.Since the density was higher, the production of organic compounds and the consequent \n\nreduction in pH of the water tank can be supported. \n\n \n\n \n\nHistological analysis \n\n From the observation made macroscopically, we found that the animals were sexually \n\nmature. From the middle third of the ovarian samples it was possible to discern and account \n\nfor the distribution of cell types in the different parts in the ovaries of each individual and thus \n\ngroup the cell types by qualitative and subjective method to identify the maturity stage of \n\ngroups throughout the experiment (Fig. 14). \n\n The analysis of the gonads of the animals from the initial group was considered an \n\ninitial reference for what would be observed in other animals throughout the experiment. \n\nBefore the pre-established results for the genus Astyanax, it could be seen the final stage of \n\nanimals sampled in the maturation experiment in the course of hours. It was observed the \n\npredominance of oocytes in an advanced stage of development, whose cytoplasm was filled \n\nwith yolk granules, which have rounded shape (Fig. 13). This oocyte maturation stage is \n\nclassified as vitellogenic, the stage considered as the starting point for the animals initially \n\nused. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\nFigure 13: Astyanax altiparanae female from the control group, named Saline. Time zero of the experiment. \nOocyte at the vitellogenic state. (Increased 20X) \n \n Qualitatively, the cells observed on the slides allowed the classification of the groups \n\nin relation to the time of sampling and their evolution throughout the experiment (Fig.15). \n\nUsing this criterion, the most frequently observed cells have been described, such as the \n\npresence of vitellogenic oocytes along the cortical cellular oocytes. Additionally to these \n\noocyte developmental stages, it was determined the presence of POFs (postovulatory \n\nfollicles), a determining factor to estimate the efficiency of the protocol applied. \n\n In general the animals from the initial group had vitellogenic oocytes in greater \n\nquantity than cortical alveolar and were not detected POFs. In females from the Saline group \n\nit was possible to estimate the predominance of vitellogenicoocytes, however the presence of \n\nPOFs was slight, even at the time of spawning. The animals collected from approximately 24 \n\nhours divided between ovulated and vitellogenic (Fig. 16), predominating the second group, \n\ncorroborating the data presented in the reproductive performance results. \n\n Given the large number of vitellogenic oocytes it can be observed troublesomeform of \n\nconnective tissue stroma and may be concluded that the animal was in an advanced stage of \n\nmaturation, since the number of oocytes at early stages of development (cortical-alveolar and \n\nperinucleolar) was low and it was displayed among the vitellogenic oocytes. However, oocyte \n\nnucleus migration was not registered in the periphery of the cell, a possible indication that the \n\nanimal still need more time to ovulation or that this event may not occur without an additional \n\nstimulus. \n\n \nhCG SALINE STRESS INITIAL \n\nCONTROL \n\n Vit POF Cor\nt \n\nVit POF Cort Vit POF Cort Vit POF Cort \n\n0h          ++ - + \n\nInitial - - - +++ - + +++ - + - - - \n\nInterm\n. \n\n++ ++ + ++ - + +++ + + - - - \n\nSpawn + +++ + ++ + + + +++ + - - - \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nFigure 15: Summary table of the frequency of the different stages of development of the oocytes and the \n\npresence of postovulatory follicles in relation to the number of hours after the experiment with Astyanax \n\naltiparanaein the different experimental groups, hCG, Saline and Stress.

The group that received \n\nhCG presented individuals at different stages of oocyte development, plus POFs on the first \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\nsampling of the experiment (Fig. 16g), without, however spawning before the end of the \n\nexperiment. This observation suggests a period of about 12 hours between ovulation and \n\nspawning, which was also observed in the Stress group. \n\n In the sampling realized at the time of spawning it was observed completely ovulated \n\novaries, and the presence of POFs was more frequent in the Stress and hCG groups (Figs. 16c, \n\nh) compared with the Saline group. These data corroborated the GSI values, which decreased \n\nin females from the Stress group at the end of the experiment, but did not change in the \n\nanimals of Saline group. Taking into account the different experimental groups, the \n\nqualitative comparison among the groups suggests the greater presence of POFs in the Stress \n\nand hCG groups in the 24 hour period of the experiment (Figs. 16c, h). Still within the Stress \n\ngroup, during the initial and intermediate periods the ovaries were full of vitellogenic oocytes, \n\nwhich have been somewhat replaced by POFs at spawning (Figs. 15 and 16). \n\n \n\nHormonal analysis  \n\n Whereas one of the main objectives of the work was to evaluate possible hormonal \n\nvariations during the experiment, we have chosen to present the results over the time for the \n\nanalyzed steroids. There was no statistical difference in the plasma CORT concentration \n\nthroughout the experimental period considering each experimental group (Fig. 17) (P = 0.711, \n\n0.775 and 0.411 for Saline, hCG and Stress groups, respectively). However, analyzing the \n\ndifferent experimental groups at each period it was observed that in the intermediate period, \n\nabout 12 hours after the beginning of the experiment, plasma CORT levels were higher in \n\nfemales from the Stress group, when compared with females from the other groups (P = \n\n0.018),showing a peak. At the initial and spawning period of experiment, plasma showed no \n\ndifference among the groups (P = 0.946 and P = 0.472, respectively).  \n\nIn the 17 OHP plasma levels (Fig.18) there was no difference among the groups over the 24 \n\nhours, with the concentration unchanged within the groups (P = 0.643, Saline group; P = \n\n0.519,Stress group; and P = 0.669,hCG group).The comparison among the different times also \n\nshowed no significant differences (P = 0.989, P = 0.091 and P = 0.196, respectively, for the \n\ninitial, intermediate and spawning periods). \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\n   \n \nFigure 17: Plasma concentration of cortisol in Astyanax altiparanaefemales during the \nexperiment. \n\nab\nDifferent letters mean significant differences among the different experimental \n\ngroups in a given period (Mean \u00b1 SEM).

Therefore, in A. altiparanae it was possible to obtain a larger amount of \n\neggs, i.e., ovulation has been possible with inducing agents, such as hCG or stress, being \n\nconnected to the stimuli by agglomeration and increase of the water flow. \n\nAlso in relation to the results obtained in the reproductive performance of animals, \n\npossible changes caused by abiotic factors can be excluded, which mostly showed no \n\nsignificant differences, except for the pH. The differences in the pH values can be attributed \n\nto the difference in the volume of water in the Stress group as well as differences in water \n\nflow in the tank. In this regard, it is notable that the exclusion of abiotic factors as \n\ndeterminants of the results ensures merit to the experimental protocol to induction, and \n\nensures that the results obtained in the groups are purely statements of physiological \n\nmodulation of animals to stimuli, as quoted by Arag\u00e3o and Ara\u00fajo (2006), to highlight the \n\nimportance of removing the interference of bias in experimental protocols. \n\n  It is known that genre Astyanax, ovarian development is similar to other teleosts \n\nwhere the ovaries are paired organs developed as elongated and leaf-like changes in color and \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\nthickness sustained throughout the reproductive cycle (Drummond, 1996). The gametes pass \n\nthrough the following phases: Initial, Previtellogenic andVitellogenic.Evaluating the results of \n\nmorphological analysis, we conclude they refer to mature cells or vitellogenic at time zero \n\n(0h) and post-vitellogenic follicles at the end of the experiment, indicating positive response \n\nto ovulation and spawning, coinciding with the descriptions of the genre (Pereira-Filho, \n\n2000). \n\nRegarding hormonal profiles, several studies have shown a duality functionamong the \n\npossible actions of corticosteroids, being able to inhibit the reproductive performance of fish \n\n(Small, 2004;. Milla et al, 2009). These authors reported that corticosteroids can cause \n\nadverse effects on reproduction and its action throughout the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal \n\n(HPG) axis. Foo and Lam (1993) argue in their study, thatCORT administration delayed the \n\nreproductive process and the quality of spawning in tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus). \n\nUnlike in the study presented by these authors, stress conditions  stimulate increased \n\ncorticosteroid production, but did not decrease or blocked the activity of other hormones, such \n\nas progestin, for example. This behavior may be related to high reproductive plasticity \n\npresented by this species on the reproduction. From the results obtained using the stress \n\nprotocol, we can infer that the modulating action of CORT did not inhibit the reproductive \n\nperformance of A. altiparanae females. \n\nIn A. altiparanae, we could observe the positive action of corticosteroids in the final \n\nmaturation, considering that the animals showed good spawning results, corroborating \n\nKubokawaet al., (1999), which attributed to CORT an important role in the maturation of \n\nPerciformes and on metabolic parameters presented by the animals during this period. \n\nSince the 1980s, in some species of teleost as Oncorhynchus mykiss, Salmo trutta, \n\nCarassius auratus and Cyprinus carpioa peak of plasma CORT was detected at the time of \n\novulation (Cook et al., 1980;.Pickering and Christie, 1981;Bry, 1985;Kime and Dolben, \n\n1985), a response that was found in A. altiparanae females from the Stress group, which \n\ndenotes a common profile for this species with the experiments carried out in recent decades. \n\nAdditionally, it is already known the ability of teleost gonads (testes and ovaries) in \n\nsynthesizing corticosteroids (Milla et al., 2009). \n\n Stolte et al. (2008) suggested that corticosteroid receptors could be regulated in \n\naccordance with different types of stress in Cyprinus carpio and that the period of greater \n\nactivity of the stressor was accompanied by behavioral changes in animals due to high \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\nsensitivity to stress. Among the aforesaid cases, deaths have been reported in individuals with \n\nhigh plasma concentrations of corticosteroids. Furthermore, Berg et al., (2005) described the \n\naction of corticosteroids in blocking gonadal progestins receptors, which may be related to a \n\nnegative action in the maturation and subsequent reproduction of some species. \n\n The progestagen17?OHP is known as a precursor steroid in the maturation of oocytes \n\nin fish and its synthesis proceeds, as in all steroids, from cholesterol. 17?OHP is synthesized \n\nfrom progesterone and it is subsequently converted into 17?,20?-dihidroxy-4pregnen-3one, \n\nknown as maturation induction steroid (MIS) in granulose cells (Lubzens et al., \n\n2010;Munakata and Kobayashi, 2010). During the experiment with A. altiparanae it can be \n\nobserved homogeneous concentration of this hormone in plasma, throughout the experimental \n\nperiod in all experimental groups.  \n\nConsidering that 17 OHP is converted to MIS near the ovulation, we might initially expect \n\nhigh levels of this hormone and differences among the experimental groups. However, the \n\nresults were quite different than expected, as this hormone did not change during the \n\nexperiment. As 17 OHP is rapidly converted into other hormones (MIS, androstenedione and \n\ncorticosteroids, mostly) we could infer that it could have been used both in the production of \n\nMIS as expected by the work of Peter and Yu (1997), and diverted to the CORT pathway \n\nproduction, as suggested in studies as Munakata and Kobayashi (2010). According to Planas \n\net al., (1992) MIS is very critical at the moment of \"germinal vesicle breakdown\" (VGBD), \n\npreparing the oocytes for fertilization, a period in which insufficient levels result in possible \n\nfailure in the reproductive process. \n\n One hypothesis for the results that have been generated can be the plasticity of A. \n\naltiparanae in the stressful conditions of captivity, so the animals would be able to use the \n\nstress situation as a potentiating agent of spawning. The results may be related as suggested \n\nby Copley (2003) with regard to \"promiscuous\" of steroid receptors, suggesting here that \n\nCORT can act as MIS due to its ability to bind to the receptors of the progestogen, amplifying \n\naction and reducing the effective action of other hormones. The contrary is also known; in \n\nOryzias latipes progestins can activate glucocorticoid receptors (Miyagawa et al., 2015). In A. \n\naltiparana ewe can infer a positive action of corticosteroids in the maturation, because the \n\nanimals showed good spawning results, corroborating Kubokawa et al., (1999), who \n\nattributed to CORT an important role in the maturation of Perciformes. \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\n According to the data presented, CORT levels fluctuated throughout the 24 hours of \n\nexperiment, showing a peak in the intermediate period of approximately 12 hours in the Stress \n\ngroup, when various POFs were already found in the ovaries of these animals. This peak of \n\nCORT at ovulation has also been reported in other classes of vertebrates, however, the \n\nunderstanding of the role of this hormone and if the increased levels can be considered as \n\ncause or consequence of the ovulatory process is still speculative (Millaet al., 2009). This \n\npeak can be correlated with ovulation, a process that demands high energy expenditure and \n\nresulting in the production of steroid inducer of final maturation (MIS), or even that CORT \n\nitself can also act as MIS. In \u201cpacu\u201d, Piaractusmesopotamicus, a species from the same \n\nfamily of A. altiparanae(Characidae) CORT levels were higher in females at the advanced \n\nstage of maturity, as well as the time of ovulation with LHRH (Gazolaet al., 1996), \n\nconfirming the importance of CORT in the ovulation process. In our hypothesis, the results \n\nobtained in the animals from the Stress group allow us to infer, in this case in particular, that \n\nCORT can be considered an important stimulus for ovulation of this species in captivity. The \n\nuse of this protocol can spare the use of synthetic hormones in breeding protocol of this \n\nspecies, allowing positive results in a short time. \n\n \n\nMolecular analyses \n\n Some physiological effects of steroid hormones are too rapid to be mediated by the \n\nclassical genomic mechanism of steroid action involving activation of nuclear steroid \n\nreceptors (Yang et al., 1994). Rapid, non-genomic steroid actions initiated on the cell surface \n\nhave been described in a wide variety of animal, tissue, and cell models (Revelli et al 1998). \n\nCorticosteroid signaling is mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (CR) and \n\nmineralocorticoid receptor (MR), which are ligand-activated transcription factors. CRs and \n\nMRs possess the four functional domains common to nuclear hormone receptors: A/B, C \n\n(DNA-binding), D (hinge region), and E (ligand-binding) domains. The C and E domains are \n\nhighly conserved across vertebrates (Mommsen et al, 1999, Pascual-Le et al., 2005). \n\n In teleosts, CR and its ligand CORT are best known for their roles in the stress \n\nresponse and, specifically, modulate aspects of intermediary metabolism, growth, behavior, \n\nand immune function (Charmandari, 2005). But, when considering the role of CORT in \n\nreproduction, there is not a consensus among the researches about positive or deleterious \n\neffects (Milla et al., 2009). Depending on the period and the intensity of stressor application, \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\nit may cause follicular artesian, advance or delay oocyte maturation and ovulation or affect \n\negg size, fertilization success, spawning behavior and progeny quality (Clearwater and \n\nPankhurst, 1997; Coward et al., 1998;Schrecket al., 2001;Okumura et al., 2002). \n\nFurthermore, the presence of corticosteroid receptors in reproductive tissues including ovaries \n\nand testis, as the corticosteroid receptors gene expression (gluco- and mineralocorticoid \n\nreceptors) found in the male/ female gonads where the transcripts were detected in the ovary \n\n(Sturm et al., 2005; Milla et al., 2006) and corticosteroid receptors (Colombe et al., 2000; \n\nFilby and Tyler, 2007; Milla et al., 2008) leads to the consideration that corticosteroids can \n\nexert positive or inhibitory effects on reproductive functions, as hypothesized here for A. \n\naltiparanae, with the possibility of induction of spawning mediated by stressful stimuli. \n\n When we evaluated the performance of reproduction of A. altiparanae by counting the \n\nnumber of fertilized eggs, and measured the levels of CORT and 17?OHP, we can infer that \n\nstress triggered a modulation in the production of steroids, mainly CORT and rapidly, since in \n\nhours, the animals had conditions to spawn when stressed, whereas without any stimulation \n\nthere was a delay to spawn.  \n\nConsidering the higher CORT levels at the intermediate period of females from the \n\nstress group, it was clear the importance to evaluate the expression of CR gene, as well as \n\nunderstand the pattern of expression of progesterone receptor (PR) gene, since the literature \n\nsuggests a higher expression of CR and a low expression of PR as a compensatory effect \n\nderived from a \"diversion of resources\" for the production of CORT, since the synthetic \n\npathway of both hormones is similar. \n\n To determine the possibility of the ovulation stimuli by CORT, we chose to observe \n\nthe expression of membrane receptors involved, which could signal a stimulation of the \n\npathway and its consequent production, explaining the results in hormonal assays. However, \n\nwe found that the CR gene is expressed throughout the experimental period, even in animals \n\nexperimentally not stressed, Saline control and hCG females, a pattern that can be considered \n\na characteristic of this species. \n\nAnalysis of the data showed, however, that the gene expression compared CR was \n\nsimilar among the female of all groups, however, there is a tendency of an increase in CR \n\ngene expression in the intermediate period of females from the stress group, coinciding with \n\nthe time of CORT peak.We know that animals from the Stress group had the best results for \n\nreproductive performance, then the chance for positive and stimulating role of CORT rinA. \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\naltiparanaereproduction may suggest a truly positive mechanism, differing from studies \n\nwhere the peak of CORT can be deleterious for ovulation, as Brown (2003) say in his study \n\nwithSalvelinus fontinalis. This kind of situation wasreported  in another species, as rainbow \n\ntrout, where females undergoing acute stress produce small amounts of eggs (Campbell et al., \n\n1992) . \n\nThese results could be explained by some types of interactions between the CR and the \n\nProgesterone receptor (PR). However, the strong answer in ovaries for PR expression did not \n\nshow great results for spawning, such as the \u201cSerum\u201d (control) group results, for example.  \n\nSo, when we saw the optimized PCR results, we observed that very clear bands for PR \n\nexpression did not so stronger on the Stress member group.  \n\nThis was one point to suppose the substrate that has been used for CORT production. \n\nAnother interesting fact about the result on the Stress group is while PR for 17OHP was not \n\nproducing stronger bands, the derivative, associate at 17,20? DHP hormone, had produced \n\nsensitivity for expression on the tissue analyzed. This is an important step to elucidate the \n\nrelation between those two hormones on the reproduction and associate an important and \n\npositive role for the CORT on this group. \n\n Focusing on CORT during reproduction, the role of this steroid must be undertaken \n\nwith higher caution regarding the potential interaction between plasma CORT levels and \n\nmating activities (Greenwood et al., 2003). In consequence, blood sampling should be rapidly \n\ncarried out to avoid any CORT contamination due to a stressful physiological state. Regarding \n\nthe other corticosteroids, if the effects of stress on their blood plasma release remain \n\nundetermined, one should pay the same attention to them. On the other hand, reproduction \n\noften corresponds to a fasting period, or is at least accompanied with a decrease of feeding. \n\nAs the plasma glucocorticoid levels are linked to the fish nutritional status, it may therefore be \n\ndifficult to distinguish between the glucocorticoid fluctuations linked to reproductive \n\nphysiological state and those linked to the alteration of the energetic metabolism, providing \n\nthe necessary adjustment to cause a physiological stimulus for spawning, even without the \n\nstrong expression of derivatives of progesterone (Zhu et al., 2003) \n\n What can be inferred by these results is that there would be no \"diversion\" of resources \n\nfor production of CORT and consequently a low expression for progestagen receptor and its \n\nderivatives, but that the gene expression of progesterone and CORT receptors remained high \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\nat the same time, which suggests another factor stimulating spawning of animals, that did not \n\nshow strong bands for the expression in all animal for progesterone on the conventional PCR.  \n\n We suggest that somehow the same period of gene expression of CORT and PR \n\nassociated to MIS (17,20-DHP) receptors has allowed the animals to ovulation and \n\nsubsequent spawning, even with animals in the group showing no different results in the \n\nconventional PCR analysis for PR (Control and Stress groups). \n\n When we look at the results found in the conventional PCR and compared with the values \n\nfound for the gene expression of the same targets genes, we realize that the answer to the \n\nreproductive behavior shown by these animals may depend on a combination of factors, \n\nwhich may be associated with another pathway for steroid synthesis. Analyzing the values \n\nobtained, we suggest that the PR may represent significant differences to influence the \n\nspawning in the other two groups, since no animals in the control group or animals treated \n\nwith stressor stimulus demonstrated any differences in their hormonal profiles, for example. \n\nWhen comparing the results between the groups, taking into account the division of animals \n\nsampled before and after spawning, the statistical difference observed, occurred only in the \n\nanimals of hCG group. This result lies within expectations, since the group had a hormone \n\nstimulating factor. Compared with the other groups PR gene expression was sharp in hCG \n\ngroup, but no statistical significant differences were found in Stress and Saline groups, which \n\nwould be an indicator that 17 OHP is not really necessary to spawning in these animals. This \n\ncorroborates the findings that another steroid, in this case, CORT can be somehow \n\nmodulating ovulation and spawning in animals, but not through CR. \n\nCortisol is the main corticosteroid in teleosts, secreted in response to stressor exposure \n\nand plays a key role in stress adaptation (Mommsen et al, 1999). But, when we analyzed the \n\nCR gene expression, interestingly, the profile of the saturation curve suggests a low gene \n\nexpression in the ovaries, demonstrating a different approach from those results obtained in \n\nthe gel bands by conventional PCR. So, when analyzing the values found for CR, gene \n\nexpression there were no statistical differences to confirm our hypothesis that CORT could \n\nexert a stimulatory effect in ovulation (acting as MIS) observed in the reproduction. However, \n\nthe results obtained in plasma of females from group Stress (peak of CORT into ovulation) \n\nindicate an undeniable role of this steroid in the behavior and/or spawning animals. Given \n\nthese results, we can infer other possibilities, considering that this receptor represents one of \n\nthe largest and possibly most ancient classes of receptors, responding to a diverse array of \n\n\n\n68 \n\n \n\nsignaling molecules (Bockaert and Pin, 1999). One possibility is that the receptor gene \n\nexpression does not necessarily correspond to the active form of the encoded protein (Millaet \n\nal., 2009).  \n\n Moreover, when testing some steroid combinations, a synergy in the maturational \n\nresponse was demonstrated between corticosteroids and MIS since the 80s. For example, in \n\nvitro treatments with CORT increased the sensitivity of oocytes to MIS in rainbow trout \n\n(Jalabert and Fostier, 1984).We can link these results within that study, when observe the \n\ngene expression results in A. altiparanae treated with hCG. Thus, although the MIS receptor \n\nis identified and the partial sequence for the associated receptor described, as the first results \n\nfor these genes for this species, therefore, these results support that corticosteroids might be \n\ndirectly and/or indirectly involved in final oocyte maturation control. \n\n Finally, we suggest that the ovaries of A. altiparanae are able to respond to the \n\ncorticosteroids stimulation and CORT, the main corticosteroid in fish, displays direct and \n\npositive effects in relation to reproduction in this species. Additionally, the available data \n\nindicates that corticosteroids may participate in the modulation of reproductive endocrine \n\ncontrol, and together with progesterone, may prove to be a possible trigger, allowing \n\nsatisfactory results in captive breeding. \n\nWe believe that the relationship between the progesterone derivatives (17,20DHP) must be \n\nfurther studied in order to determine the actual level of output required for stimulation of the \n\nanimals, as well as the role of the actions of corticosteroids and progesterone together in end \n\nof the steroidogenic pathway.This step can be considered as satisfactory taking into account \n\nthe limited knowledge about the sequences or gene expression of steroid receptors on global \n\ngenetic databases.We would like to highlight the importance of these results for future \n\nresearch, assuming that hormone receptors and their interaction are impacting on the \n\nreproduction of the species of vertebrates. \n\n In conclusion, the results here found contribute to elucidate the physiological basis \n\nthat drives the reproductive plasticity of this species. The ability of A. altiparanae to \n\nreproduce under stress conditions triggers new ideas about hormonal pathways involved in \n\nfish ovulation and spawning. Additionally, this proposal provided important data about \n\ngenetic sequences of CR and PR and the interaction between them during the experiments. \n\nTherefore, we do not rely only on steroid plasma profile to understand the physiological \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\nmodulation of ovulation under stress conditions, starting a deeper understanding of this \n\nspecies physiology. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\nArag\u00e3o, M.A &amp; Ara\u00fajo, P.A 2006.

Centrifuge 1 minute.  \n\n15. Remove the supernatant immediately and transfer it to a new tube. If white \n\nsilica is carried over, spin again and transfer the supernatant to a new tube. The DNA \n\nwill be ready to use for directly sequencing or use for cloning. \n\n \n\nAnnex 6 \u2013 Cloning purification  \n\n1. First at all, make sure place the Binding Buffer on ice before starting the procedure.  \n\n2. Prepare the incubated tube, centrifuge at 13.000xg for 30 seconds. Discard the \n\nsupernatant. \n\n3. Add 250\u00b5 l Suspension Buffer + RNase to the centrifuge tube containing the bacterial \n\npellet. \n\n4. Re-suspend the bacterial pellet and mix well. \n\n5. Add 250\u00b5 l of Lysis Buffer. Mix gently by inverting the tube 3~6 times. Is important \n\ndo not vortex. Incubate for 5 minutes at any temperature between +15\u00b0C and +25\u00b0C. \n\n6. Then, treat the lysed solution add 350\u00b5 l chilled Binding Buffer. Mix gently by \n\ninverting the tube 3 to 6 times and then incubate on ice for 5 minutes.  \n\n7. Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 13.000 x g. \n\n8.  After the centrifugation, insert one High Pure filter tube into one Collection Tube.  \n\n9. Transfer the entire supernatant into upper buffer reservoir of the Filter tube and insert \n\nthe entire higher pure tube assembly into a centrifuge.  \n\n10. Centrifuge for 1 minute at full speed.  \n\n11. After this centrifugation the Filter tube from the Collection Tube should be removed \n\nand the flow through liquid should be discarded. The Filter tube should be re-inserted \n\non the same collection tube.  \n\n12. So, add 500\u00b5 l of Wash Buffer I to the upper reservoir of the Filter Tube.  \n\n13. Centrifuge for 1 minute at full speed and discard the flow through \n\n14. Add 700\u00b5 l of Wash Buffer II to the upper reservoir of the Filter Tube. Centrifuge for \n\n30-60 seconds at full speed and discard the flow through \n\n15. After discarding, centrifuge the entire High Pure assembly for additional 1 minute. So, \n\ndiscard the Collection Tube.  \n\n\n\n84 \n\n \n\n16. Insert the Filter Tube into a clean, sterile 1.5 ml centrifuge tube.  \n\n17. Add 100\u00b5 l of Elution Buffer or double dist water to the upper reservoir of the Filter \n\nTube. \n\n18. Centrifuge the tube assembly for 1 minute at full speed.  \n\n19. Then, the micro-centrifuge tube now contains the eluted plasmid DNA"}]}}}
