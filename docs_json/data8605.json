Patience is the \n\nMother of Science. A lot of patience was employed in this thesis, and so it is my wishful thinking that \n\none day this work may be useful for someone \u2013 either physician or scholar \u2013 in the world. \n\n \n\nMy greatest acknowledgement goes to my parents. Everything I did was for them. In the beginning of \n\nmy PhD, they asked several times: \u201cso, what are you working on exactly?\u201d It was quite interesting, \n\nactually, especially considering that they still ask me this regularly. After all, what can a weird \n\ntechnology called \u201clayer-by-layer\u201d do to prevent things like high blood pressure, cholesterol, kidney \n\nstones, heart diseases, thrombosis, acute muscular pain and blindness, of which they suffer? I can \n\nhonestly say that such question was the turning point in my research, because it gave me purpose. \n\nNow, I try to look for the medical potential of the things I do and hope that this thesis makes them \n\nproud. \n\n \n\nI want to deliver a word of appreciation and admiration to my supervisor, Prof. Jo\u00e3o Mano. I believe \n\nmost of my progress in the scientific world has been possible because of him. He was always very \n\nreceptive to new ideas \u2013 as long as they were good \u2013 comprehensive about situations going on out of \n\n3B\u2019s and challenged my mind and the minds of all his students with new techniques and workarounds \n\nfor experimental \u201cheadaches\u201d. Looking back, I believe I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better supervisor! \n\nThank you for your help. \n\n \n\nI would like to acknowledge the 3B\u2019s Research Group and its director, Prof. Rui Reis, for the possibility \n\nof developing my PhD thesis in the facilities at AvePark, providing everything I needed at my disposal. \n\nAlso, I would like to acknowledge Prof. Nuno Neves who, as a representative of the Doctoral Program in \n\nBiomedical Engineering, helped me several times through the whole academic process related to the \n\nUniversity of Minho, and very quickly when these things may take weeks. \n\n \n\nTo my colleagues of 3B\u2019s, it is complicated naming people, since we are so many. In 4 years, we all \n\nshared happiness and frustration, but all are moments that I cherish. Although I appreciate help from \n\neverybody, I would like to thank especially \u00c1lvaro, Albino, Ana Catarina, Catarina Cust\u00f3dio, Clara, Diana \n\n\n\nNanostructured functional multilayer coatings incorporating biomimetic macromolecules for biomedical \n\napplications \n\n \n\nvi \n\nRibeiro, Isabel, Jo\u00e3o Requicha, Manuel, Mariana, Nuno, Pedro, Praveen, Sara Oliveira, S\u00edlvia Mihaila, \n\nSofia and Yan, for their help in my work and, particularly, during lunches and coffee-breaks! Of course, I \n\ncouldn\u2019t forget my \u201cbeloved former students\u201d, Joana and Sara Gil, who were introduced to the lab \n\nenvironment for the first time by me. Thank you for your patience, especially Sara. She arrived just \n\nbefore I departed to Spain, and, even when I tried to give her my utmost attention, I\u2019m pretty sure she \n\nmust have felt abandoned. Sorry! \n\n \n\nTo my colleagues of Bioforge. These \u201ccolorful\u201d researchers at Valladolid sure have a way to receive \n\nforeign people in their group: we didn\u2019t need 1 week to feel like we had known each other for years. \n\nActually, that was the case for a couple of them but not for most of the new people. Alicia, Ana, Arturo, \n\nChus, Guillermo, Irene, Israel, Ito, Laura, Luc\u00eda (allora ragazza!), Luis, Matilde, Mohamed, Roc\u00edo and \n\nVanessa, thank you for making me feel at home. But my deepest gratitude goes to the people that \n\naccompanied my research since the beginning: Javier, Merche, and, of course, Prof. Carlos \u2013 my \n\ncosupervisor during my time abroad and a very enjoyable host \u2013 and Alessandra. Let me thank you with \n\nmy best Italian \u2013 the little I managed to grasp: \u201cgrazie per tuo aiuto\u201d! Next time I go to Valladolid, I\u2019ll \n\nmake sure to bring you the fabled \u201cp\u00e3o-de-l\u00f3\u201d you kept hearing about! \n\n \n\nTo Cristina: I can\u2019t imagine how this period of my life would have been without you! I will never forget all \n\nthe talks, the laughs, and the moments we spent together. Thank you for all the support, friendship and \n\nlove, basically for being always there to me, even when I didn\u2019t deserve. \n\n \n\nLast, but not least, I would like to thank my dear friends \u201cThe Seven Dwarves\u201d, or six, since I am one of \n\nthem: Cor\u00e1lia, Diana, Em\u00edlia, Joaquim, Joana, and Vera (no Snow White in the group). I want to thank \n\nyou for your company and contact during all these years, and the good moments we spent together. It \n\nis nice to see, even when separated, how your friendship and your support could make things so much \n\neasier. \n\n \n\nI acknowledge financial support from Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia (FCT, grant \n\nSFRH/BD/61126/2009), Fundo Social Europeu (FSE) and Programa Diferencial de Potencial Humano \n\n(POPH). \n\n \n\n\n\nNanostructured functional multilayer coatings incorporating biomimetic macromolecules for biomedical \n\napplications \n\n \n\nvii \n\nAbstract \n\nThe modification of surfaces has been a key aspect in biology and biotechnology, for applications \n\nincluding cell expansion, biomaterials development and preparation of substrates for regenerative \n\nmedicine. In this thesis, the layer-by-layer (LbL) technique was employed in the modification of surfaces \n\nfor multiple purposes, namely for films with improved adhesiveness, enhanced cell adhesion, drug \n\ndelivery capsules, and magnetic spatial positioning. The working hypothesis was that LbL could be used \n\nin the modification of surfaces not only planar but also three-dimensional, using solely polymeric \n\nmaterials from a variety of natural origins or obtained by recombinant routes. \n\nHerein, chitosan (CHI), a well-known polycation with marine origins, was used recurrently as an \n\ningredient in various multilayer formulations, driven by intermolecular forces such as electrostatic and \n\nhydrophobic interactions. First, multilayer coatings of CHI and an adhesive bacterial exopolysaccharide, \n\nlevan, were fabricated. As a control, CHI and alginate films \u2013 two marine polysaccharides often \n\nregarded as good natural adhesives \u2013 were assembled in parallel. The adhesive strength of 50 \n\nCHI/levan bilayers was determined to be about 3 times higher than the control. The adhesion of L929 \n\ncells was also higher in levan-based films. \n\nNext, CHI was used along polyanionic elastin-like recombinamers (ELRs), a recombinant class of \n\nelastin-like polymers, exhibiting the cell adhesion motif arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD). Although \n\nelectrostatic interactions were relied upon to construct LbL coatings, they were not the sole mechanism \n\nof buildup between CHI and ELRs. The film construction of CHI and one of nine ELRs differing in amino \n\nacid content, length and biofunctionality was followed in situ at pH 4.0 and 5.5 using a quartz-crystal \n\nmicrobalance. Their thicknesses were estimated using the Voigt-based model for viscoelastic films, \n\nrevealing that thicker films were obtained in the presence of hydrophobic interactions between ELRs \n\nand partially neutralized chitosan, i.e., when the pH was adjusted to 5.5, near its pKa. ELR/alginate \n\ncoatings were also monitored, completing a total of 36 combinations studied. The results agreed with \n\nthe ones from the CHI-based films: thicker films were obtained for partially neutralized alginate, at a pH \n\nvalue of 4.0. \n\nBidimensional coatings of CHI and CHI/ELR-RGD were demonstrated to be stimuli-responsive by means \n\nof wettability measurements: they exhibited a moderate hydrophobic surface but switched to an \n\nextremely hydrophilic one when temperature, pH or ionic strength were raised above 50\u00baC, 11, or \n\n\n\nNanostructured functional multilayer coatings incorporating biomimetic macromolecules for biomedical \n\napplications \n\n \n\nviii \n\n1.25 M, respectively. The presence of RGD enhanced the adhesion of SaOs-2 cells, in comparison to \n\nfilms ending either in CHI or a nonbioactive RDG analogue. \n\nCHI/ELR-RGD coatings were extrapolated to the third dimension as spherical microcapsules assembled \n\naround calcium carbonate particles. Aiming at drug administration, two mechanisms were studied: \n\n(i) simple diffusion out of the microcapsules, and (ii) cellular uptake. In the first case, release studies at \n\n25 and 37\u00b0C with \u201cbovine serum albumin\u201d-loaded microcapsules demonstrated that they provided a \n\nsustained release over 14 days, but with reduced capsule permeability at physiological temperature, \n\ndue to the temperature-induced molecular transition of ELRs. Furthermore, a higher numbers of layers \n\nprovided an added barrier to the diffusion of the encapsulated protein. The microcapsules were also \n\nnoncytotoxic towards L929 cells. In the second case, the internalization efficacy and intracellular traffic \n\nof RGD- or nonbioactive RDG-functionalized microcapsules by human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) \n\nwas assessed. The data suggests that microcapsules were internalized mainly through \n\nmacropinocytosis and that surface functionalization did not play a significant role on this phenomenon, \n\nalthough intracellular processing was faster for RGD-functionalized microcapsules. Both microcapsule \n\ntypes were noncytotoxic toward hMSCs for microcapsule/cell ratios between 5:1 and 100:1. \n\nFinally, inspired by the complex hierarchical and compartmentalized structure of cells, liquefied alginate \n\nmacroscopic spheres coated with a chitosan/alginate shell were conceived. Within this liquefied \n\nenvironment, rhodamine and multilayer microcapsules were confined, with the latter encapsulating \n\nfurther either rhodamine or magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). At 25 and 37\u00baC, rhodamine when \n\nencapsulated within the inner microcapsules showed a sustained release profile, with the diffusion \n\nkinetics being even more reduced at 25\u00baC. The release of rhodamine encapsulated in the outer \n\nliquefied alginate compartment did not show significant differences as a function of temperature. \n\nEncapsulating MNPs within the microcapsules provided magnetic responsiveness to the whole \n\ncompartmentalized device and guided mobility capability. \n\nThe developed work shows that LbL is a versatile technique that provides the means to develop a wide \n\narray of systems useful in biomedical applications, from adhesive and cell seeding planar supports to \n\nthree dimensional structures for smart drug delivery, guided therapies and customized microreactors as \n\ndisease models and microtissue production in laboratory. \n\n\n\nRevestimentos multicamada nanoestruturados funcionais incorporando macromol\u00e9culas biomim\u00e9ticas \n\npara aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas \n\n \n\nix \n\nResumo \n\nA modifica\u00e7\u00e3o de superf\u00edcies tem sido um aspeto fundamental em biologia e biotecnologia, em \n\naplica\u00e7\u00f5es como a expans\u00e3o de c\u00e9lulas, desenvolvimento de biomateriais e prepara\u00e7\u00e3o de substratos \n\npara medicina regenerativa. Neste trabalho, a t\u00e9cnica de camada-a-camada foi utilizada na modifica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde superf\u00edcies para v\u00e1rios fins, como filmes com adesividade e ades\u00e3o celular melhoradas, c\u00e1psulas \n\npara administra\u00e7\u00e3o de drogas, e o posicionamento espacial magn\u00e9tico. A hip\u00f3tese foi a de que esta \n\nt\u00e9cnica poderia ser utilizada na modifica\u00e7\u00e3o de superf\u00edcies planares ou tridimensionais, usando \n\nexclusivamente pol\u00edmeros obtidos de v\u00e1rias origens naturais ou a partir de vias recombinantes. \n\nO quitosano (CHI), um reconhecido policati\u00e3o com origens marinhas, foi recorrentemente utilizado \n\ncomo ingrediente em v\u00e1rias formula\u00e7\u00f5es de multicamadas, impulsionado por for\u00e7as intermoleculares, \n\ntais como intera\u00e7\u00f5es eletrost\u00e1ticas e hidrof\u00f3bicas. Primeiro, revestimentos de CHI e um \n\nexopolissacar\u00eddeo bacteriano adesivo, levano, foram constru\u00eddos. Como controlo, foram comparados \n\ncom filmes de CHI e alginato \u2013 polissacar\u00eddeos marinhos considerados bons adesivos naturais. A for\u00e7a \n\nadesiva de 50 bicamadas de CHI/levano foi determinada como sendo cerca de 3 vezes mais elevada \n\ndo que o controlo. A ades\u00e3o de c\u00e9lulas L929 foi tamb\u00e9m maior em filmes contendo levano. \n\nEm seguida, CHI foi utilizado juntamente com recombin\u00e2meros tipo-elastina (ELRs), uma classe de \n\npol\u00edmeros tipo-elastina, exibindo a sequ\u00eancia de ades\u00e3o celular \u201carginina-glicina-\u00e1cido asp\u00e1rtico\u201d (RGD). \n\nEmbora intera\u00e7\u00f5es eletrost\u00e1ticas tenham sido invocadas para a constru\u00e7\u00e3o de multicamadas \n\nauto-organizadas, estas n\u00e3o foram o \u00fanico mecanismo de intera\u00e7\u00e3o entre CHI e ELRs. A constru\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nfilmes de CHI e um de nove ELRs diferentes em conte\u00fado aminoac\u00eddico, tamanho e biofuncionalidade \n\nfoi monitorizado in situ a pH 4.0 e 5.5 utilizando uma microbalan\u00e7a de cristais de quartzo. As suas \n\nespessuras foram estimadas usando o modelo de Voigt para filmes viscoel\u00e1sticos, revelando que os \n\nfilmes mais espessos foram obtidos na presen\u00e7a de intera\u00e7\u00f5es hidrof\u00f3bicas entre ELRs e CHI \n\nparcialmente neutralizado, isto \u00e9, quando o pH foi ajustado para 5.5, pr\u00f3ximo do seu pKa. Filmes de \n\nELR/alginato tamb\u00e9m foram monitorados, completando um total de 36 combina\u00e7\u00f5es estudadas. Os \n\nresultados obtidos estiveram em concord\u00e2ncia com os dados dos filmes baseados em CHI: filmes mais \n\nespessos foram obtidos para alginato parcialmente neutralizado, a um valor de pH de 4.0. \n\nAtrav\u00e9s de medi\u00e7\u00f5es de \u00e2ngulos de contato, demonstrou-se que os revestimentos bidimensionais de \n\nCHI e ELR-RGD eram responsivos a est\u00edmulos: exibiram uma superf\u00edcie moderadamente hidrof\u00f3bica \n\nmas converteram-se em extremamente hidrof\u00edlicas quando se aumentou a temperatura, o pH ou for\u00e7a \n\n\n\nRevestimentos multicamada nanoestruturados funcionais incorporando macromol\u00e9culas biomim\u00e9ticas \n\npara aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas \n\n \n\nx \n\ni\u00f3nica acima de 50\u00baC, 11, ou 1,25 M, respetivamente. A presen\u00e7a de RGD melhorou a ades\u00e3o de \n\nc\u00e9lulas SaOs-2, em compara\u00e7\u00e3o com filmes terminados ou em CHI ou num an\u00e1logo n\u00e3o bioativo, RDG. \n\nOs revestimentos de CHI/ELR-RGD foram extrapolados para a terceira dimens\u00e3o sob a forma de \n\nmicroc\u00e1psulas esf\u00e9ricas constru\u00eddas em torno de part\u00edculas de carbonato de c\u00e1lcio. Com a finalidade \n\nde administra\u00e7\u00e3o de drogas, foram estudados dois mecanismos: (i) a difus\u00e3o simples para o exterior \n\ndas microc\u00e1psulas e (ii) a incorpora\u00e7\u00e3o celular. No primeiro caso, estudos de liberta\u00e7\u00e3o a 25 e 37\u00b0C \n\ncom microc\u00e1psulas contendo albumina do soro bovino demonstraram uma liberta\u00e7\u00e3o sustentada ao \n\nlongo de 14 dias, mas sendo as c\u00e1psulas menos perme\u00e1veis a uma temperatura fisiol\u00f3gica, devido \u00e0 \n\ntransi\u00e7\u00e3o molecular dos ELRs induzida pela temperatura. Al\u00e9m disso, um n\u00famero mais elevado de \n\ncamadas proporcionou uma barreira adicional \u00e0 difus\u00e3o da prote\u00edna encapsulada. As microc\u00e1psulas \n\nforam tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o citot\u00f3xicas para c\u00e9lulas L929. No segundo caso, a efic\u00e1cia de internaliza\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\ntr\u00e1fego intracelular de microc\u00e1psulas funcionalizadas com RGD ou a sequ\u00eancia n\u00e3o bioativa RDG por \n\nc\u00e9lulas estaminais mesenquimais humanas (hMSCs) foi avaliada. Os dados sugerem que as \n\nmicroc\u00e1psulas foram internalizadas principalmente atrav\u00e9s de macropinocitose, e que a \n\nfuncionaliza\u00e7\u00e3o da superf\u00edcie n\u00e3o desempenhou um papel significativo neste fen\u00f3meno, embora o \n\nprocessamento intracelular tenha sido mais r\u00e1pido para microc\u00e1psulas funcionalizadas com RGD. \n\nAmbos os tipos de microc\u00e1psulas foram n\u00e3o citot\u00f3xicas para hMSCs para r\u00e1cios de \n\nmicroc\u00e1psula/c\u00e9lula entre 5:1 e 100:1. Finalmente, com inspira\u00e7\u00e3o na hierarquia complexa e estrutura \n\ncompartimentada das c\u00e9lulas, esferas macrosc\u00f3picas de alginato liquefeito revestidas com camadas de \n\nCHI/alginato foram concebidas. Dentro deste ambiente liquefeito, rodamina e microc\u00e1psulas foram \n\nconfinadas, com estas \u00faltimas podendo conter ou mais rodamina ou nanopart\u00edculas magn\u00e9ticas \n\n(MNPs). A 25 e 37\u00baC, rodamina quando encapsulada no interior de microc\u00e1psulas mostrou um perfil \n\nde liberta\u00e7\u00e3o sustentada, sendo a cin\u00e9tica de difus\u00e3o ainda mais reduzida a 25\u00b0C. A liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nrodamina encapsulada no compartimento externo de alginato n\u00e3o exibiu diferen\u00e7as significativas em \n\nfun\u00e7\u00e3o da temperatura.

The procedure is based on the contact of the substrate with a solution with an \n\noppositely charged polymer.

The first \n\nsection provides the general introduction to the thesis. The second section corresponds to the \n\nexperimental methods and materials used. The third section shows the experimental results obtained in \n\nthe context of this thesis and their discussion, focusing on the optimization of layer-by-layer (LbL) \n\nstrategies for biomedical applications. The fourth section finalizes this thesis with concluding remarks. \n\nThe body of the thesis chapters is based on a series of peer-reviewed papers and book chapters \n\npublished or submitted for publication. Each thesis chapter is presented in manuscript form, i.e., \n\nabstract, introduction, experimental section, results and discussion (or in two separate sections, results \n\nplus discussion), conclusion, and some of them with acknowledgements. A list of relevant references is \n\nalso provided as a subsection within each chapter. The contents of each part and chapter are described \n\nbelow in more detail. \n\n \n\nSection I \u2013 General introduction \n\nChapter 1, Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue \n\nengineering applications: This chapter provides an introduction to the mechanisms behind the \n\nconstruction of LbL films and coatings, a technique based on the self-assembly of materials in the form \n\nof nanolayers, which may belong to distinct classes of materials. This technique served as the basis to \n\nthe whole work described in this thesis. \n\nChapter 2, Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies: In the sequence of \n\nChapter 1, which focused primarily on the intermolecular phenomena driving the self-assembly of \n\nmultilayer films, Chapter 2 reviews the state-of-the-art applications derived from LbL strategies focused \n\non the technologies with interest in biomedicine. A thorough discussion regarding the current \n\napplications of LbL is presented, while hypothesizing about the potential of this technique in providing \n\nbetter devices for current medicine and for tissue engineering applications. \n\nChapter 3, Elastin-like macromolecules: Most of the developed work relied on the use of elastin-like \n\nrecombinamers (ELRs), a class of genetically-engineered polypeptides with stimuli-responsiveness. The \n\nproperties and applications of this class of material are described, as well as their origin and \n\nresemblance with natural elastin. \n\n\n\nNanostructured functional multilayer coatings incorporating biomimetic macromolecules for biomedical \n\napplications \n\n \n\nlii \n\nChapter 4, Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications: The use of ELRs allowed developing \n\nmultilayer devices that exhibited stimuli-responsiveness.

Namely, levan, an exopolysaccharide \n\nproduced by extremophilic bacteria, is known to exhibit adhesive properties. Thus, it was used as an \n\ningredient for multilayer formulations with enhanced adhesiveness. \n\nChapter 7, Layer-by-layer film-growth using polysaccharides and recombinant polypeptides: a \n\ncombinatorial approach: In this chapter, the type of interactions that drive the self-assembly of ELRs \n\nand polysaccharides into layers \u2013 namely chitosan and alginate \u2013 was studied. It is based on partial \n\nfindings from the literature, where there has been evidence that not only electrostatic interactions are at \n\nwork during the construction of polymer/protein hybrid films but also hydrophobic ones. \n\nChapter 7 \u2013 Appendix, Nanostructured thin coatings from chitosan and an elastin-like recombinamer \n\nwith acute stimuli-responsive behavior: This appendix complements Chapter 7 and consists in a \n\ncomparative study between ELR-functionalized films which amino acid sequence is organized either as \n\na single or multiple blocks with distinct properties. \n\nChapter 8, Layer-by-layer assembly of chitosan and recombinant biopolymers into biomimetic coatings \n\nwith multiple stimuli-responsive properties: In this chapter, polyanionic elastin-like recombinamers \n\nproduced by Escherichia coli strains were used. ELRs appear as an elegant example of how natural \n\nmaterials inspire the creation of new and tailored materials using biological processes. Their response \n\nto external stimuli and genetic nature allows incorporating specific motifs like the cell adhesion motif \n\narginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) while retaining the repeating amino acid structure of natural elastin. \n\n\n\nNanostructured functional multilayer coatings incorporating biomimetic macromolecules for biomedical \n\napplications \n\n \n\nliii \n\nWith this polymer, surfaces with stimuli-responsive properties and enhanced cell adhesion were \n\nenvisaged. \n\nChapter 9, Nanostructured and thermoresponsive recombinant biopolymer-based microcapsules for the \n\ndelivery of active molecules: This chapter describes the attempt to extrapolate ELR-polysaccharide \n\nhybrid films to the third dimension in the form of spherical microcapsules. The mechanism of diffusion \n\nof an encapsulated protein to the exterior of the capsules was studied for the development of drug \n\ndelivery devices. \n\nChapter 10. Cellular uptake of multilayered capsules produced with biomimetic and genetically \n\nengineered macromolecules: Similarly to Chapter 9, microcapsules are produced for drug delivery. In \n\nthis case, the mechanism of delivery is focused on the internalization of the microcapsules by cells \n\nrather than diffusion to the surrounding medium. \n\nChapter 11. Multifunctional compartmentalized capsules with a hierarchical organization from the nano- \n\nto the macro-scales: The possibility of using LbL to develop structures with higher degrees of complexity \n\nis studied in this chapter by assembling compartmentalized spherical structures with hierarchical \n\norganization and customized stimuli-responsiveness. It constitutes a fine example of inspiration on \n\nnatural living structures such as that of natural cells. \n\n \n\nSection IV \u2013 Concluding remarks \n\nChapter 12.

Due to its self-\n\nassembled nature and use of small masses of material, coatings can be produced using aqueous \n\nsolutions under mild conditions of temperature, pH, and pressure, with minimal energy requirements \n\nand material waste. Herein, we review the multitude of LbL mechanisms for constructing \n\nnanostructured devices of relevance to applications such as tunable cell adhesion and metabolism, \n\ndrug delivery, and biomineralized and smart systems. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1\n This chapter is based on the following publication: \n\nCosta R.

Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue \n\nengineering applications \n\n \n\n5 \n\n1.1 Introduction \n\nThe modification of surfaces has been a key aspect in biology and biotechnology applications, including \n\ncell expansion, biomaterials development and preparation of substrates for regenerative medicine [1-3]. \n\nIn the field of implantable biomaterials and tissue engineered constructs, the bulk material properties \n\nare generally considered to determine the overall properties of a biomaterial. Surface properties, \n\nhowever, are of utmost importance as the surface constitutes the first interface between an implant and \n\nthe organism, and will drive subsequent tissue and cellular events including protein adsorption, cell \n\nadhesion and inflammatory response, all of which are necessary for tissue remodeling [4-6]. Thus, \n\nsurface engineering is highly important for developing devices with improved biological performance. \n\nMany processing techniques have been suggested and employed for the purpose of modifying \n\nsubstrates [7], but in the past two decades alternatives to common surface engineering strategies have \n\nemerged. Inspired by Nature, scientists and engineers have developed techniques based on biomimetic \n\nconcepts. In Nature, evolutionary processes have constantly improved the design and functionality of \n\nnatural materials. A well-known example is the layered organization of nacre found in the shells of sea \n\nanimals. This layered and hierarchical structure containing calcium minerals is capable of dissipating \n\nhigh amounts of mechanical energy[8,9]. Mimicking natural layered structures has been attempted in \n\nthe laboratory. In particular, the alternate adsorption of polyanions and polycations onto solid substrates \n\nis a reliable, flexible, and simple approach to modify a substrate while allowing the integration of a wide \n\nrange of molecules, including those with biological relevance. As a result, multilayered thin films can be \n\nconstructed with nanometric precision. This technique was first introduced by Decher, Hong and \n\nSchmitt and has denominated the layer-by-layer (LbL) field [10]. \n\nLbL is a self-assembly-driven surface modification strategy that allows the construction of \n\nnanostructured films onto substrates of any geometry, from simple bidimensional surfaces to more \n\ncomplex three-dimensional porous scaffolds. The underlying principle lies in the existence of multiple \n\nintermolecular interactions, such as electrostatic contacts, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen \n\nbonding, where the cooperative effects of multipoint attractions play the most important role. It is a \n\ntechnique that is easy to perform, versatile, offers fine control over the materials structure, and \n\nproduces materials that are robust in physiological environments [11-13]. Because this technique may \n\nbe performed using various complementary substances, a vast choice of available materials may be \n\nadded to a multilayer formulation, such as proteins, nucleic acids, polysaccharides, virus particles, \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue \n\nengineering applications \n\n \n\n6 \n\norganic polymers, molecular assemblies, and inorganic substances, allowing construction of LbL \n\nassemblies with very specific properties [4]. The buildup can be performed at mild conditions, namely \n\nstandard laboratory temperatures and pressures, and mild pH, and can be tuned by making small \n\nadjustments in such conditions. Moreover, LbL does not involve the use of organic solvents. The mild \n\nand non-aggressive processing conditions of LbL make it an appealing technique for tissue engineering \n\napplications. Molecules with biological relevance may be embedded in the multilayer materials, with \n\nbioactivity preserved, particularly important for drug delivery applications. Biomaterials and ligands with \n\nmore specific functions, such as cell adhesion enhancers, may be used in order to mimic biological \n\nstructures and functions, rendering a substrate more instructive for cell behavior [14-16]. Exploiting the \n\nadvantages of LbL, multilayer systems have already been proposed for various biomedical applications. \n\nAn example includes biomimetic composite coatings that regulate drug release or manipulate the \n\nadhesion, differentiation, proliferation, and even function of attached cells. In the following sections, \n\nthese applications and associated multilayer formulations will be reviewed. \n\n1.2 Interaction between biomaterials as ingredients for multilayer formulations \n\nOne of the key features of LbL adsorption is the ability to use ingredients from distinct classes of \n\nmaterials. Usually the most important requirement is that two distinct materials possess \n\ncomplementarity, that is, the properties of both materials result in attraction. A well-known example \n\nmost exploited example is the self-assembly driven by electrostatic interactions of oppositely charged \n\ncomponents, in which polyanions and polycations interact and assemble [17]. Besides electrostatic self-\n\nassembly (ESA), other types of interactions that can drive the construction of multilayers include short-\n\nrange interactions, such as van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding [11]. The strength of these \n\ninteractions may depend on several intrinsic factors, such as the molecular weight of polymers or size \n\nof inorganic particles, charge density, polarity, and also external factors, like the temperature, the pH of \n\nthe solvent, and ionic strength (see following sections). Importantly, it is now acknowledged that the \n\ndriving force behind multilayer formation is not only mutual interaction, but also by the gain in entropy \n\ndue to the release of counter-ions [13,18]. The variation of one or more of these parameters can lead to \n\na more favorable interaction and consequent buildup of a nanostructured coating. The result is, \n\nhowever, dependent on the original properties of the materials: for instance, varying the pH of a weak \n\npolyelectrolyte will greatly affect its overall charge density. Several biomaterials of synthetic and natural \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue \n\nengineering applications \n\n \n\n7 \n\norigins have been used since LbL was first introduced, many of which capable of being used for \n\nmultilayered constructs while displaying biologically relevant properties. \n\n1.2.1 Buildup mechanisms of synthetic and inorganic materials \n\nMany types of charged molecules and nano-objects are suitable for deposition by ESA. So far, the most \n\npopular deposition materials have been synthetic polyelectrolytes. Synthetic materials are usually man-\n\nmade and can be highly functional [19]. With the availability of thousands of monomers and their \n\nseemingly endless combinations, polymer science has developed a wide array of complex but well-\n\ndefined structures with specific properties, such as molecular weight and charge density. Other \n\nmaterials suitable for deposition using ESA are inorganic (e.g., calcium-containing or clay mineral \n\nparticles) or metallic materials, usually consisting of a single geometrical charged structure (e.g., \n\nspheres or platelet-like objects) with natural or artificial origins [20,21]. \n\nSynthetic polymers, though not often similar to biological structures, have been used to define and \n\nquantify parameters important for the construction of nanostructured multilayer coatings. The main \n\nadvantages of synthetic polymers are that they are easily chemically modified and they enable certain \n\nbuildup parameters to be precisely adjusted. The pioneers of LbL proved its concept by creating \n\nultrathin homogeneous films on solid surfaces [10]. Positively charged aminopropylsilanized fused \n\nquartz or silicon single crystal substrates served as supports for the ESA buildup. Poly(styrene \n\nsulfonate) (PSS) and poly(vinyl sulfate) (PVS) served as polyanions and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) \n\n(PAH) and poly-4-vinylbenzyl-(N, N -diethyl-N -methyl)-ammonium iodide as polycations. Immersing the \n\npositive support in an aqueous solution of one of the polyanions resulted in the adhesion of the \n\npolymeric molecules and reversal of charge density of the substrate. A rinsing step followed to remove \n\nloosely adsorbed molecules. Then the substrate was exposed to a solution of one of the polycations, \n\nagain reversing the charge. By repeating this process, the stepwise construction of a coating was \n\nachieved. With 39 layers, Decher et al. were able to produce films as thin as 44 nm. \n\nThe striking simplicity of fabricating a wide range of LbL-modified substrates was rapidly recognized by \n\nthe scientific community. Many studies with different materials collectively identified the key parameters \n\ninfluencing the fabrication of nanostructured multilayer films and determined how to optimize them. The \n\npH of the polyelectrolyte solutions used during buildup has been studied by using poly(acrylic acid) \n\n(PAA) and PAH to fabricate polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) [22,23]. Varying the pH of the dipping \n\nsolutions considerably changes the charge density of a weak polyelectrolyte when operating above or \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue \n\nengineering applications \n\n \n\n8 \n\nbelow the acid dissociation constant (pKa) of the polymer. When adjusting the pH of PAA and of PAH \n\nabove and below their pKa, respectively, a higher degree of ionization could be exploited, favoring ESA-\n\ndriven adsorption. In the opposite case, when operating near the acidity constant, the charge density is \n\nat its lowest. Consequently, fewer charged molecules are available to form a new top layer and more \n\npolyelectrolyte molecules are needed to interact with the underlying layer for ESA [16,24,25]. This \n\naffects the internal structure of the fi lm in terms of layer conformation since adjusting the pH modifies \n\nthe charge density of the polyelectrolytes. An additional observation is that increasing the charge density \n\nof the adsorbing polymer will favor thinner polyelectrolyte layers, whereas increasing the charge density \n\nat the surface will favor thicker adsorbed layers. The latter enables the production of thicker and \n\nrougher films, while the former results in thinner and smoother films [23,26]. \n\nThe addition of salts to the adsorbate solutions has been studied since ions can interfere with the \n\nelectrostatic balance of molecules and the internal PEM structure. PAH, PSS and \n\npoly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride (PDADMAC) have been used to demonstrate that the addition \n\nof salt increases the thickness of the layers due to a screening mechanism of charge\u2013charge repulsions \n\n[27,28]. Basically, the electrostatic repulsion among groups with the same charge sign is reduced by \n\nthe interaction with the salt ions present in solution and allows for a more stable buildup and interaction \n\nbetween layers. The adsorption process can be increased with increasing concentrations of salt, but \n\nsince this mechanism is somewhat similar to that of pH, high concentration of salt may render the \n\nmaterials uncharged, which may induce desorption or \u201cstripping\u201d rather than adsorption [29,30]. \n\nTemperature also affects the buildup mechanism of multilayer films. However, while most studies on \n\ntemperature focus on its effect on stability and functionality after construction, few study temperature as \n\na buildup variable. A study by Salom\u00e4ki, Vinokurov and Kankare [31] used films made of PSS and \n\nPDADMA to verify that temperature has a remarkable effect on the apparent mass of the resulting films. \n\nIn aqueous solutions containing sodium bromide, the mass of adsorbed material at 55 \u00baC was \n\napproximately 5 times higher than a construction performed at a room temperature of 25 \u00baC, along with \n\na tendency for the mass to increase exponentially. In the same report, similar results were found for \n\nPSS and PAH films. The conclusion was that a higher temperature during the deposition increases the \n\nmobility of the adsorbed molecules, resulting in deeper layer interpenetration deeper through the PEMs \n\nand a greater likelihood of finding more energetically optimal binding sites at the deposition site. \n\nPolyelectrolyte multilayers made using synthetic polymers have been extended to applications other \n\nthan simple interface tuning. For instance, a dye may be used as a film ingredient or it may be loaded \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue \n\nengineering applications \n\n \n\n9 \n\nafter film assembly [32]. The latter takes advantage of the swelling properties of multilayer films, in \n\nwhich a dye can be loaded \u2013 and reversibly unloaded \u2013 into the film by immersion in a saturated \n\nsolution. Ideally, a dye may be replaced by a therapeutic molecule or growth factor to act as a drug \n\ndelivery device upon implantation or for use in cell culture. The versatility of LbL is not limited to \n\npolymers. Other extended functionalities include the use of inorganic particles, such as bioactive \n\nnanoparticles (BNPs), to develop surfaces that could mineralize into calcium phosphate crystals under \n\nthe presence of a simulated body fluid [33]. Carbon nanotubes have also been used as LbL ingredients \n\nalong with polyelectrolytes for substrates with improved mechanical properties [34-36]. Work with clay \n\nplatelets [37], and graphene [38] has also taken advantage of the LbL methodology, although polymers \n\noffer more mobility to the internal structure of the film. In summary, LbL can be used as a means to \n\ncoat surfaces and control the interface in almost any fashion desired, due to the several mechanisms \n\nthat influence its thickness, roughness and loading capabilities. Such surface property control makes \n\nLbL a powerful technique to develop tunable cutting-edge devices whose surfaces influence the fate of \n\ncells, important for a range of applications in conventional medicine and tissue engineering. \n\n1.2.2 Natural-based polymeric materials \n\nNatural materials are intricate structures which have risen from hundreds of millions of years of \n\nevolution. Comparing to our current technology, natural structures are more multifaceted than \n\nman-made materials, forming complex arrays and hierarchical structures with multiples functionalities \n\n[39-41]. The advantage of using natural-based polymers for biomedical and tissue engineering \n\napplications lies in their similarity with biological macromolecules, thus avoiding triggering chronic or \n\nimmunological reactions and toxicity [42]. They possess more similarity to the extracellular matrix \n\n(ECM) than synthetic materials and are therefore appropriate multifunctional ingredients for \n\nconstructing multilayer films and coatings with better interface with biological environments. The range \n\nof potential LbL ingredients spans the gamut from synthetic to natural materials, including \n\npolysaccharides, polypeptides, proteins, nucleic acids, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and even viruses, \n\nallowing highly biomimetic surfaces to be engineered [4,12,13,16,27]. \n\nOne of the natural polymers most exploited to construct multilayer films is hyaluronic acid (HA). \n\nHyaluronic acid, also known as hyaluronan or hyaluronate, is an important glycosaminoglycan \n\ncomponent of the connective tissue, synovial fluid and the vitreous humor of the eye [43]. It is a linear \n\npolysaccharide composed of numerous repelling anionic groups capable of binding cations and water \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue \n\nengineering applications \n\n \n\n10 \n\nmolecules. Solutions of HA exhibit clear viscoelastic properties that make them excellent biological \n\nabsorbers and lubricants. HA may also be obtained through a process of microbial fermentation, \n\navoiding the risk of animal-derived pathogens [44]. \n\nSeveral authors have focused on the use of HA as a polyanion [45-47]. In particular, HA has been \n\ncombined with poly(L-lysine) (PLL) [48-50]. PLL is a linear polypeptide containing an amino group and \n\nhas been widely used in biomaterial applications to enhance cell adhesion [51-53]. A thorough \n\ninvestigation of the PLL/HA system provided a better understanding of the exponential growth \n\nmechanism of layer thickness, as opposed to the linear growth mechanism introduced by Decher [54-\n\n56]. For this system, the exponential growth mechanism relies on the diffusion of at least one of the \n\npolymers \u2018in-and-out\u2019 of the molecular chains during each bilayer deposition step. In these studies, it \n\nwas PLL that diffused through the film. \n\nPolysaccharides of marine origin form another important class of natural materials. Chitosan (CHI) is a \n\npolysaccharide exhibiting cationic properties and solubility under acidic conditions. Its precursor, chitin, \n\nis the second most important natural polymer in the world and can be extracted from marine \n\ncrustaceans including shrimp and crabs. CHI possesses several characteristics favorable for promoting \n\ndermal regeneration and accelerated wound healing [57]. Alginate (ALG) is another polysaccharide of \n\nmarine origin, namely from brown algae. Its structure contains carboxyl groups, which makes it \n\nnegatively charged [58]. Both of these polysaccharides possess adhesive, non-toxic, bacteriostatic, \n\nfungistatic, hemostatic, and anti-microbial properties, making them ideal for tissue engineering \n\napplications. Because of these unique features, CHI and ALG have been frequently used in biomedical \n\napplications including burn dressings, drug delivery, and implants [59-61]. They have been used as LbL \n\ningredients, both together or in conjugation with other materials. PLL/ALG and CHI/HA systems have \n\nbeen shown to possess an internal structure typically produced by the exponential growth mechanism \n\n[54,62]. Martins et al. [63] demonstrated the loading capability of CHI/ALG films with human serum \n\nalbumin (HSA) which depended on the availability of amino groups to bind the negatively charged \n\nprotein. Crosslinking with glutaraldehyde reduced that availability and HSA adsorption in comparison to \n\nuncrosslinked films. \n\nThe molecular weight of LbL ingredients is an important property influencing the buildup mechanism. \n\nHowever, few studies using natural polymers have systematically investigated the influence of polymer \n\nmolecular weight on the physical properties of polyelectrolyte multilayers, since it is difficult to obtain \n\nmonodisperse polymers from natural sources. As such, studies related to molecular weight have mostly \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue \n\nengineering applications \n\n \n\n11 \n\nfocused on the use of well-characterized synthetic polymers [64-66]. Nevertheless, using CHI and HA \n\nfilms, Kujawa et al. [67] found that the thickness increased when the molecular weight of these \n\npolysaccharides was higher. They demonstrated that the higher the molecular weight the thicker the \n\nfilm: a longer polymer tends to adsorb in a \u201cloopier\u201d way, while a smaller molecule adsorbs in an \n\nextended conformation. Therefore, with longer polymers, there are more anchoring sites available for \n\nthe next layer to adsorb and potentially higher interpenetrating capabilities than with smaller molecules. \n\nThe mechanical properties of multilayer films can affect cell adhesion and differentiation. Increasing the \n\nYoung\u2019s modulus (i.e. stiffness) of multilayer films improves cell adhesion [68-70]. This behavior makes \n\nLbL substrates suitable as tunable platforms to control cell adhesion. Moreover, LbL substrates with \n\nvarying support stiffness could potentially induce stem cell differentiation. Multilayers can also be used \n\nas reservoirs for therapeutic molecules (discussed below) and can incorporate naturally occurring smart \n\nbiomaterials. By fabricating a film containing stimuli-responsive ingredients, interface properties could \n\nbe changed on demand. \n\nAll films constructed by ESA from weak polyelectrolytes \u2013 synthetic or natural \u2013 are inherently pH-\n\nresponsive. Properties like Young\u2019s modulus, roughness or wettability may be tailored by varying the \n\nfilm assembly conditions, due to the dissociation of the weak acidic and alkaline functional groups on \n\nthe chains. Wood et al. [71] demonstrated the pH controlled degradation of a film, from which \n\ntherapeutic molecules were release to the bulk medium. Ionic strength may also be used as a stimuli-\n\nresponse mechanism for films made of weak, and, unlike pH, strong polyelectrolytes [27-30]. A \n\nscreening effect caused by the interaction between free counter-ions and charged polymer groups leads \n\nto a reduction of the electrostatic repulsion between charged groups of the same sign. Such \n\nmechanisms are potentially useful for drug delivery, because they could provide sustained and \n\ncontrolled release with greater effectiveness, lower toxicity, and improved patient convenience over \n\nconventional formulations. However the sharp variations of pH and ionic strength associated with them \n\nmay be harmful for cells. On the other hand, cells are less sensitive to temperature variations, at least \n\nfor temperatures near 37\u00b0C. Therefore, temperature responsive materials could be a more favorable \n\nchoice for use with cells. One of the most popular temperature responsive polymers is poly(N-\n\nisopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm). PNIPAAm has a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) around \n\n32\u00b0C enclosing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [72]. Below the LCST, the polymer is \n\nsoluble in aqueous solution, with an expanded or hydrated coil conformation; above it, the polymer \n\nbecomes insoluble, preferring a folded globular structure. PNIPAAm is a synthetic material but \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue \n\nengineering applications \n\n \n\n12 \n\ncombinations with natural polymers are possible. CHI, a weak polycation, has been grafted with \n\nPNIPAAm to construct films with dual responsiveness [73]. Elastin-like recombinamers (ELRs) are \n\nanother class of temperature-responsive materials; a class of the elastin-like polymers (ELPs) family, \n\nthey are genetically engineered peptide-based macromolecules obtained through the fermentation of \n\nmodified bacterial strains [74]. ELRs are rooted in the peptide sequence of natural elastin present in \n\ntissues that require elasticity as part of their function, such as skin, tendons and muscles. In an \n\naqueous environment they are known to self-assemble and exhibit a transition temperature (Tt): below \n\nTt, the free polymer chains adopt random coil conformations; above it, they fold into an organized \n\nstructure known as ?-spiral. Although ELRs respond primarily to temperature, the effects of other \n\nstimuli, such as pH, ionic strength and concentration also affect the transition phenomenon. Their \n\ngenetically-engineered origin also allows motifs to be integrated that have biological relevance, such as \n\ncell adhesion [75] and mineralization enhancers [76]. In LbL, they have already been suggested as \n\nsuitable ingredients for constructing films with multiple stimuli-responsiveness [77-79]. They are an \n\nelegant example of how Nature inspires engineers to develop new multifunctional materials for tissue \n\nengineering applications. \n\n1.3 Scalability to three dimensions \n\nLbL was first introduced as a surface engineering technique for planar surfaces. However, this \n\ntechnology can be used to coat surfaces on substrates or templates with a variety of shapes and sizes \n\nbeyond planar. As a result, devices such as scaffolds that could only be fabricated through conventional \n\nmethods may now be engineered to exhibit new tunable properties according to the desired application. \n\n1.3.1 Membranes \n\nMost polyelectrolyte multilayers may be assembled with up to dozens of layers to a thickness that may \n\nreach tens of micrometers. However, PEMs are assembled and adhere to underlying substrates and \n\ncannot be detached without damaging the films. Detached films, usually called \u201cfree-standings\u201d, are \n\npotentially useful for a range of nanostructured membrane based devices for a range of sensing, \n\ndetection, and drug delivery applications [80,81]. \n\nA typical approach to fabricate free-standings involves a sacrificial layer or substrate that is dissolved \n\nafter buildup [82,83]. Cellulose acetate, for instance, can be used as a substrate and dissolved with \n\n\n\nChapter 1.

A potential disadvantage of such an approach is that the films may undergo \n\nboth chemical and physical changes during the post-processing steps to separate the film from the \n\nunderlying substrate and interfere with the internal structure of the multilayers. More recently, other \n\nstrategies have been introduced that avoid using chemicals to remove the template. Hydrophobic \n\nsubstrates have been used to assemble free-standing PEMs, exploiting a peeling mechanism of the film \n\nfrom the substrate. Larkin et al. [85] used Teflon and polypropylene as planar templates from which \n\nCHI and HA films could be easily peeled off without damage. Another method consists of assembling \n\nfilms virtually \u201con air without templates\u201d. Mallwitz and Laschewsky [86] prepared ultrathin freestanding \n\narrays of LbL films in the holes of electron microscopy grids (100 \u00d7 100 \u00b5m). The precise mechanism \n\nwas not clear. Apparently, the pores were so small that the multilayer ingredients were suspended \n\nacross the orifices instead of coating their walls, so that thin polymeric lamellae could remain trapped in \n\nthe pores. However, the authors did not develop a strategy to extract the free-standings from the grid. \n\n1.3.2 Capsules \n\nLbL has been suggested as a technology to produce capsules as tunable drug carriers for drug delivery \n\napplications and cell differentiation [87,88]. Typically, the template for a hollow or loaded capsule is a \n\nnano- or micro-particle. Similarly to some free-standings, the template particle is sacrificial. After \n\nassembling the multilayers, the core is removed with a solvent. The result is a hollow multilayer shell \n\nwhich may encapsulate molecules of interest such as DNA and proteins [35,89]. The sacrificial cores \n\nwere organic microparticles (typically 1\u201310 mm) such as polystyrene or melamine formaldehyde, which \n\nwere then dissolved by organic solvents or strong acids [90]. The drawback of such an approach is that \n\nit employs aggressive solvents that could damage the remaining shell and destroy the functionality and \n\npurpose of the structure. Also, organic residues from the aggressive solvents could affect biological \n\nenvironments, making the approach less appealing for tissue engineering. Such drawbacks led to the \n\nintroduction of other templates that could be dissolved under less aggressive conditions, such as \n\nmesoporous silica (with diameters of 500 nm to 5 \u00b5m, dissolved in hydrogen fluoride) and porous \n\ncalcium carbonate (with diameters of 3\u20135 \u00b5m, dissolved in ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, \n\nEDTA) [91,92]. \n\nThe concept of permeability after the buildup is of great interest for drug delivery and tissue engineering \n\napplications: not only must a carrier be able to retain and preserve the drug but also release it when \n\nnecessary and in a controlled fashion. The most obvious way to control such permeability is to vary the \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue \n\nengineering applications \n\n \n\n14 \n\nnumber of layers assembled around a template: more layers result in higher resistance to molecular \n\n[93]. In order to fill the interior of a multilayer capsule with a drug, both pre- and post-loading \n\nencapsulation mechanisms have been exploited [94]. In pre-loading, the sacrificial core may already \n\ncontain the molecule of interest that will remain upon dissolution, or crystals of the molecule of interest \n\nthat can be used as a template and liquefied after assembly, without removal. In the post-loading \n\napproach, prefabricated hollow capsules can be loaded by altering the permeability of the capsule shell \n\n[95,96]. Several mechanisms based on the effect of external variables have been exploited to reversibly \n\nchange the permeability of a multilayer shell. Multilayer capsules are inherently responsive to pH and \n\nionic strength due to their interference with the electrostatic balance between layers. The permeability \n\nof such responsive capsules was studied by Shutava et al. [97] for capsules based on tannic acid and \n\nPAH. The capsules seemed impermeable to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextrans at neutral pH but \n\nbecame permeable at both low and high pH values. Ibarz et al. [98] reported that the permeability of \n\nhollow PSS/PAH polyelectrolyte capsules sharply improved upon increasing the concentration of salts. \n\nTemperature has also been suggested as a mechanism for post-loading. It is believed that a \n\nrearrangement occurs with the increase of temperature due to a tendency of shells to reduce the \n\nshell/water interface [99]. However it has only been achieved for temperatures as high as 50\u201370\u00baC, \n\nand is thus not suitable for biological applications [100-102]. For drug release, the same mechanisms \n\nused to post-encapsulate a molecule of interest could also be used to modulate its release in a \n\ncontrolled fashion. \n\n1.3.3 Tubes \n\nHollow tubes of micron or submicron diameter and high aspect ratio are interesting for various \n\napplications. They possess a large specific surface area, making them appealing for catalysis, sensing, \n\nor as tissue scaffolding [103-105]. Hollow tubes could be used for encapsulation purposes and find \n\napplications in fields like drug delivery and as transport channels in microfluidics [106]. In biology, \n\ntubes of submicron dimensions are commonly found, like protein nanotubes or microtubules, and play \n\nan essential role in providing mechanical reinforcement in cells and small blood vessels [34]. \n\nTube-like structures may be fabricated in a similar manner to other shapes templates (cylindrical in this \n\ncase) are coated and subsequently dissolved under conditions that do not destroy the coating, thus only \n\ntube-like objects remain. To date, this morphology has not been extensively used and only a few reports \n\nexist of multilayer nanostructured hollow tubes compatible with tissue engineering applications. Tube-\n\n\n\nChapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue \n\nengineering applications \n\n \n\n15 \n\nlike structures have previously been fabricated by assembling polyelectrolytes onto micrometric glass \n\nfibers that were then dissolved by hydrogen fluoride [107]. Another strategy to fabricate tube-like \n\nstructures is to consists in the coat porous membranes (the templates) with polyelectrolytes, which in \n\nturn adsorb to the wall of the pores, after which the membranes are dissolved [35]. He et al. [108] \n\npursued an interesting approach by assembling tubes of PSS and PAH using the porous template \n\nmethod and transforming them into capsules by varying temperature. This structural transition from \n\ntubular to vesicular or vesicle-like systems is often considered for drug delivery, gene delivery, self-\n\nassembled nanoreactors, or biochemical sensors [109]. \n\nIn the future, multilayer tubular structures may be of significant interest in tissue engineering. For \n\ninstance, nanostructured artificial blood vessels could be developed as an alternative to the \n\nconventional autologous grafting treatment by the incorporation of collagen and elastin to mimic the \n\nintima, media and adventitia layers [110,111]. \n\n1.3.4 Three-dimensional scaffolds \n\nLbL is not limited to the simple geometries shown so far. The technique may be applied to more \n\ncomplex geometries by using more intricate structures as templates. Porous agglomerates of particles, \n\nfor instance, can be coated and, similarly to previous structures, the template can be chelated, leaving \n\nonly the multilayer assembly to serve as supports for cell culture. Miranda et al. [112] and Sher, \n\nCust\u00f3dio and Mano [113] have developed nanostructured multilayer structures based on agglomerates \n\nof particles of chitosan (not leachable) and paraffin (leachable), respectively. Their works, which will be \n\nreferred to again, demonstrate that more complex and functional structures may be made using LbL. \n\n1.4 Application of nanostructured multilayer devices in tissue engineering \n\nThe numerous possibilities for adjusting the chemical, physical, and mechanical properties of multilayer \n\nfilms have garnered attention from tissue engineers hoping to develop systems to control protein and \n\ncell adhesion and release therapeutic molecules and growth/differentiation factors. In addition, \n\nresearchers wish to tune the surface properties by of such microsystems adding specific ligands or \n\nstimuli-responsive biomaterials. \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue \n\nengineering applications \n\n \n\n16 \n\n1.4.1 Controlling cell adhesion and proliferation \n\nWhen a biomedical device enters in contact with a cell-populated biological environment, adhesion is \n\nthe first event to occur Adhesion is the first cell event that occurs when a cell comes into contact with a \n\nmaterial\u2019s surface, which will be followed by proliferation and, in the case of stem cell cultures, \n\ndifferentiation. \n\nWe have already mentioned that changing the mechanical properties of a multilayer film may affect the \n\ncellular adhesion. Schneider et al. [69] have studied the cell adhesion of HCS-2/8 human \n\nchondrosarcoma cells on PLL/HA films with various degrees of crosslinking. The Young\u2019s modulus of \n\nthe film could be varied over two orders of magnitude simply by varying the concentration of a \n\ncrosslinker, carbodiimide, from 3 to 400 kPa for the lowest and highest concentrations, respectively. \n\nIncreasing the film stiffness also increased the roughness and number of attached cells, showing how a \n\nsimple modification to the mechanical properties to multilayer films can affect their response in a \n\nbiological environment. Phelps et al. [114] also applied this concept to selectively crosslink the outer \n\nregion of a PLL and poly(glutamic acid) (PGA) film, resulting in a rigid outer skin to promote cell \n\nattachment, while leaving the film (and any embedded bioactive species) unaffected. Crosslinked CHI \n\nand HA films have also been studied in vivo by implantation in a rat oral cavity [115]. Crosslinked films \n\ndemonstrated up to 60% higher resistance to degradation compared to uncrosslinked samples. \n\nMultilayer films may be engineered with exhibiting anti-fouling properties to control cellular and bacterial \n\nadhesion by enhanced resistance to serum proteins. A straightforward way to build \u201cstealth\u201d substrates \n\nof any morphology is to use derivatives of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), a highly hydrated polymer \n\neffective in rendering surfaces non-adsorbent to proteins [116-118]. Another strategy is to add \n\nantimicrobial agents. Ettiene et al. have added defensin [119] and chromofungin [120] to the films \n\nconstitution and reported growth inhibition up to 98% for Escherichia coli with defensin and 65% for \n\nCandida albicans with chromofungin. Rendering a surface non-fouling can serve as immuno-\n\n\u2018\u2018camouflage\u2019\u2019 to prevent the immune rejection of implanted biomaterials or to enhance the efficiency of \n\ninjected drug delivery vehicles. \n\nThe application of LbL to more complex structures is highly important for tissue engineering \n\napplications such as cell culture platforms, where higher hierarchical organization better resembles \n\nnative tissues. Besides bidimensional, spherical, and tubular shapes, more complex geometries such as \n\nagglomerated shapes can be fabricated and used as scaffolds for cell culture. LbL may be used to \n\nagglomerate beads [112] or to coat free-packet leachable templates [113] leading in both cases to \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue \n\nengineering applications \n\n \n\n17 \n\nporous structures that may be populated by cells. Recently, Ye et al. [121] coated a decellularized \n\nporcine aortic valve with CHI and heparin showing anti-thrombotic properties. The device was shown to \n\nbe hemocompatible by reducing platelet adhesion while allowing the proliferation of endothelial \n\nprogenitor cells. The work of Sher, Cust\u00f3dio and Mano [113] introduced an interconnected three-\n\ndimensional porous scaffold using a new drop-wise perfusion technique over a three-dimensional (3D) \n\ntemplate formed by free-form moldable paraffin wax spheres held together only by the LbL coating \n\n(Figure 1.1). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1.

On the right: \n\nFlorescence images showing the multilayered 3D assembly after leaching of the core material. \n\nReprinted (adapted) with permission from [113]. Copyright 2010 Wiley-VCH. \n\n \n\nThe paraffin was dissolved by dichloromethane, leaving only the assembled layers as a scaffold. SaOs-2 \n\nhuman osteoblast-like cells were seeded and showed attachment and proliferation. The authors did not \n\ncharacterize the system for its mechanical properties, however. It is possible that the resulting structure \n\nis not adequate for applications involving high loads, such as bone regeneration, but may be more \n\nappropriate for regenerating soft tissues, such as cartilage or nerves. \n\n1.4.2 Controlling cellular metabolism: encapsulation and differentiation \n\nMultilayer films may be of use for cell encapsulation since the films can coat various cell types and even \n\nbe used to build multilayered cell architectures. Developing a device that provides immune protection \n\nvia microencapsulation as well as enhanced control of both transport and surface physicochemical \n\ncharacteristics is an important and ambitious step in the development of an effective encapsulating \n\nbarrier. One approach to encapsulate cells is by using coated liquefied capsules. For example, Costa et \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue \n\nengineering applications \n\n \n\n18 \n\nal. [122] have used liquefied alginate beads coated with CHI and ALG to immobilize SaOs-2 human \n\nosteoblast-like cells. Another cell encapsulation approach exploits cell surface charge to assemble \n\npolyelectrolytes. Krol et al. [123] pursued this surface charge approach with pancreatic islet cells to \n\nassemble a multilayer shell that effectively encapsulated them for the treatment of diabetes. By \n\nincubating Langerhans cells with alternating solutions of polycationic PAH or PDADMAC and polyanionic \n\nPSS, the authors built a barrier that covered and protected the cells. The shell was permeable and the \n\ncells were immunologically protected and retained their insulin secretion capability (Figure 1.2). The \n\ncoating, however, consisted of synthetic materials which could be cytotoxic in the long term.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2. On the left: Light microscopy image of trypan blue-stained islets after encapsulation with \n\nthree pairs of polyelectrolyte layers (PDADMAC/PSS)3. On the right: Electron micrographs of \n\nPAH/PSS/PAH-coated islets. Reprinted (adapted) with permission from [123]. Copyright 2006 \n\nAmerican Chemical Society. \n\n \n\nVeeradabran et al. [53] followed a similar approach to encapsulate individual mouse mesenchymal \n\nstem cells (MSCs) using PLL and HA. The cells were encapsulated within shells with thicknesses of \n\napproximately 6\u20139 nm. Cell morphology and viability were maintained for up to 1 week. Encapsulation \n\nhas tremendous potential for the maintenance and differentiation of stem cells. LbL allows the \n\nencapsulating shells to be tuned to achieve optimal permeability. Nutrients, waste, and chemical \n\ndifferentiation factors could be exchanged between the cell and its external environment and the \n\ndifferentiation process triggered on demand. Other approaches have been introduced to drive the \n\ndifferentiation of cells by incorporating specific factors in a multilayer formulation. Dierich et al. [124] \n\npresented a formulation with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), PLL and poly(L-lysine succinylated) \n\n(PLLs), along with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and tissue growth factors (TGFs). Using this \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue \n\nengineering applications \n\n \n\n19 \n\nsystem, they were able to drive the differentiation of embryoid bodies into cartilage and bone. Another \n\ninteresting approach is to embed differentiation factors into spherical shapes, which have a higher \n\nsurface area and improved accessibility compared to planar substrates. Facca et al. [125] created \n\ncapsules templated in silica particles (1 \u00b5m) coated with a similar formulation. The incubation with \n\nembryonic stem (ES) cells led to both in vitro and in vivo bone formation. It is unclear if the delivery of \n\nBMP was due to the degradation of the capsules or to their internalization by the cells. The latter option \n\nis a possibility: Rivera-Gil et al. [126] have recently demonstrated the internalization of multilayer \n\ncapsules by embryonic NIH/3T3 fibroblasts. \n\nThese encapsulation methods have proven to be novel approaches to shield cells from certain external \n\nfactors and to controllably differentiate stem cells either by taking advantage of the permeable nature of \n\nmultilayer films or by targeting the intracellular environment directly. Therefore, LbL structures have \n\npotential use for tissue engineering applications where cell transplantation or damaged tissue \n\nreplacement is necessary. \n\n1.4.3 Biomimetic and \u201cintelligent\u201d and substrates \n\nSystems used for biomedical and tissue engineering applications must be biocompatible and not trigger \n\ntoxic, inflammatory, or rejection responses. The structures and properties found in natural materials \n\nhave inspired the development of multilayer systems with higher degrees of functionalization. One \n\napproach is to incorporate natural materials directly into multilayer systems. For instance, \n\nnanostructured films containing CHI retain some of CHI\u2019s anti-microbial \n\nproperties [127]. Another approach consists of integrating ingredient molecules, such as bioactive \n\nligands, that can drive specific phenomena mimicking their native function. Picart et al. [128] \n\nincorporated arginine-glycine-(aspartic acid) (RGD) a cell adhesion promoter, with the substrate using \n\nPLL and RGD-grafted-PGA in the terminating layer. The proliferation of primary human osteoblast cells \n\nwas enhanced on for films containing RGD compared to films without. RGD-enhanced proliferation was \n\nobserved not only for simple adsorbed layers, but also for crosslinked films. To mimic the \n\nmicroenvironments of bone marrow and the thymus, Lee and Kotov [129] incorporated delta-like 1 \n\nNotch ligands (DL-1) at the surface of PEM films. The Notch ligands stimulated hematopoietic stem \n\ncells (HSCs) to differentiate into T-cell lymphocytes and progressively develop their own ECM. \n\nAdding stimuli-responsive materials to multilayer formulations offers additional functionalization, by \n\ncontrolling surface properties and the conformational rearrangement of molecular chains. Stimuli-\n\n\n\nChapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue \n\nengineering applications \n\n \n\n20 \n\nresponsive properties have been engineered into several types of systems, such as grafted surfaces and \n\nhydrogels [130], and are beginning to be used in multilayer systems for controlling biological events \n\nsuch as cell attachment/detachment. As mentioned before, pH and ionic strength may be useful stimuli \n\nresponse mechanisms for drug delivery applications, but changes of these variables beyond \n\nphysiological conditions may be too aggressive for cell cultures. Temperature changes, on the other \n\nhand, are usually more tolerated by cells for temperatures up to 37\u00b0C. Costa et al. used an ELR \n\ncontaining RGD to generate bilayer coatings [131] and multiple stimuli-responsive multilayers [78] with \n\nenhanced cell adhesion. By varying the pH, ionic strength and temperature of CHI/ELR films, it was \n\npossible to switch the wettability of the substrates from a moderately hydrophobic character (contact \n\nangle around 70\u00ba) to a superhydrophilic (contact angle of 0\u00ba) (Figure 1.3). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.3. Physical changes induced in ELR modified surfaces. (a) Wettability variations with different \n\ntemperatures. Reprinted (adapted) with permission from [131]. Copyright 2009 Wiley-VCH. (b) \n\nTopography at distinct pHs. Reprinted (adapted) with permission from [78]. Copyright 2011 Wiley-VCH. \n\n \n\nHowever, the variation was observed for values not suitable for biological studies: pH 11; ionic strength \n\n0.15 M; and 50 \u00baC. Nevertheless, at physiological conditions, the cellular adhesion of a SaOs-2 \n\nosteoblast-like cell line was higher than in films ending in CHI or a scrambled non-functional RDG \n\nsequence. Martins et al. [73] then described a multilayer system of ALG and PNIPAAm-grafted CHI to \n\nreproduce the cell-sheet technology [132]. SaOs-2 human osteoblast-like cells seeded onto coated \n\nsubstrates ending in the modified CHI were allowed to achieve confluence at 37\u00baC. Upon decreasing \n\nthe temperature to 4\u00baC, the peeling effect enabled cells to be detached from the surface as a thin layer. \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue \n\nengineering applications \n\n \n\n21 \n\nZahn et al. [133] demonstrated a similar approach by using the ion-induced detachment of myoblast \n\nlayers by the eroding effect of ferrocyanide on PLL and HA multilayers. Incorporating biofunctional \n\ningredients and bioinspired concepts into multilayer systems has enhanced the functionality of such \n\nsystems and is producing promising results for tissue engineering applications. \n\n1.4.4 Multilayers in controlled drug delivery \n\nCurrent advances in biomedicine have been driven by the need to develop systems that can effectively \n\nencapsulate, protect and deliver an active agent with specific kinetics [134]. At the same time, distinct \n\nclasses of biomolecules are widely available and related to the treatment of several diseases or the \n\ndevelopment of new biomedical devices. Ideally, a biomolecule carrier should act as a compartment \n\nwith tunable drug permeability. The multilayered capsule systems described above are ideal for such \n\ndrug delivery applications, including the associated methods to load and control the release of \n\ntherapeutic molecules and growth/differentiation factors. The adequate loading efficiency and controlled \n\nrelease of the molecules of interest, such as growth factors, are necessary to ensure the survival of cells \n\nin tissue engineering applications. Erel et al. [135] fabricated hydrogen-bonded multilayers of micelles \n\nof poly[2-(N  - morpholino)ethyl methacrylate-block-2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (PMEMA-b   -\n\nPDPA), a dicationic block copolymer, encapsulating pyrene onto a surface with tannic acid. The films \n\nwere dual responsive and released pyrene upon increasing either temperature or pH. Crouzier et \n\nal. [136] developed crosslinked films of PLL and HA as reservoirs loaded with a recombinant human \n\nBMP-2 (rhBMP-2) to control the differentiation of myoblasts into fibroblasts. They demonstrated that the \n\namount of loaded rhBMP-2 could be regulated by film thickness and assembly conditions. Also, the \n\nrhBMP-2 loaded in the films retained its bioactivity and was protected for three consecutive cultures. \n\nAnother particular area being targeted for multilayer drug delivery systems is cancer treatment, where \n\nthe uncontrolled systemic administration of chemotherapeutics comes with several drawbacks to the \n\npatients. Zhao et al. [137] developed CHI/ALG microcapsules loaded with doxorubicin, an effective \n\nanticancer drug, and demonstrated that the apoptosis of HepG2 tumor cells could be induced in vitro \n\nby incubating with loaded microcapsules. A suspension of microcapsules was also injected directly to \n\ntumors induced in mice, inducing a higher tumor inhibition compared to free drug administration. De \n\nGeest et al. [138] demonstrated that polymeric multilayer capsules (PMLCs) increase antigen delivery \n\ntoward antigen-presenting cells in vivo, enforcing antigen presentation and stimulating T-cell \n\nproliferation. Poon et al. [139] recently addressed the stability and biodistribution of electrostatic self-\n\n\n\nChapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue \n\nengineering applications \n\n \n\n22 \n\nassembled nanoparticles for systemic administration and off-body tracing by imaging techniques. They \n\nprovided evidence of the importance of a larger number of layers and the role of the terminating layer in \n\nterms of functional retention. A formulation of PLL and dextran films topped with a final layer of HA \n\nassembled onto gold nanoparticles or quantum dots. In mice, these coated particles had a blood \n\nelimination half-life of 9 hours and low liver accumulation. These reports represent a step forward the \n\nuse of LbL systems in in vivo applications such as cancer treatment, and augment the mounting \n\nevidence that such systems can be designed to have minimal or no negative effects on living organisms. \n\n1.4.5 Biomineralized multilayers \n\nDeveloping systems with LbL technology to facilitate bone regeneration or to improve the mechanical \n\nproperties of substrates is an active area of research. Such research is adding versatility to \n\nbiomineralization processes by developing controlled nanostructured assemblies that tune the kinetics \n\nof calcium phosphate, apatite formation, and ultimately bone regeneration [140-142]. \n\nBioactive coatings on orthopedic implants may create an environment compatible with osteogenesis \n\nand provide bone-friendly interfaces for forming natural bonding junctions between the implant and host \n\nbone [143]. Couto, Alves and Mano [33] developed hybrid films of CHI and bioactive glass \n\nnanoparticles that mimicked the brick-and-mortar layered structured of nacre. They showed that the \n\nincorporation of BNPs rendered the substrates prone to mineralization upon immersion in simulated \n\nbody fluid (SBF) solution. The mineralization was also more pronounced with an increasing number of \n\nlayers. Fukui and Fujimoto [144] described a hybrid nanocapsule templated in phospholipids that \n\nencapsulated phosphate ions (Figure 1.4). The phospholipids were coated using CHI, dextran or DNA \n\nand then incubated in a solution containing calcium ions. They demonstrated that the chemical surface \n\nchange could influence the counter-ion diffusion and therefore the mineralization rate. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1.

The \n\nprocedure can even be performed using mild conditions and in a cell-friendly environment. The most \n\nrecent results show that LbL may be used to encapsulate cells, control cell adhesion and metabolism, \n\ntune the release of encapsulated molecules, render a substrate with smart responsiveness, and \n\nenhance mineralization. We believe that the technology will follow two trends in the near future. The first \n\ntrend will involve using existing nanostructured multilayer devices in more in vivo applications that take \n\nadvantage of the spatial organization and bioactivity, adjustable stiffness and chemistry, or adjustable \n\nstiffness and bioactivity, of multilayer devices. The other trend will involve the development of more \n\nintricate structures with hierarchical complexity embedded in devices with multiple functionalities, such \n\nas controlling the diffusion of gases and nutrients to cultured cells. Higher levels of functionalization \n\nshould enable the development of systems exhibiting intelligent responses to external stimuli. For \n\nexample, drug release systems could respond to an external stimulus by releasing encapsulated drugs \n\nand therefore influencing cellular metabolism on demand. The inclusion of specific ligands or metallic \n\nparticles could enable the development of targeted delivery strategies for cell therapies and transplant. \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue \n\nengineering applications \n\n \n\n24 \n\nIn summary, research on nanostructured multilayer devices will likely result in innovative low-cost \n\ntechnologies to meet critical biomedical needs. \n\n1.6 References \n\n[1] Falconnet D., Csucs G., Michelle Grandin H., and Textor M., Surface engineering approaches to \n\nmicropattern surfaces for cell-based assays, Biomaterials 2006, 27: 3044-3063. \n\n[2] Hook A.

In this review, the potential uses of LbL films in biomedical \n\nengineering based mainly in the assembly of polyelectrolytes are reviewed. Examples of recent \n\ndevelopments are provided, from the modification of substrates to improve their biointegration or to add \n\nspecialized properties, to the three-dimensional extrapolation of this technique as more complex \n\nstructures for cell seeding, drug delivery devices, biosensors and customizable microreactors.

Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n39 \n\n2.1 Introduction \n\nSurface modification is a prominent field of engineering of utmost importance for biomedical \n\napplications. When having in mind the contact of a medical device with the human body \u2013 resulting \n\nfrom surgical or topical implantation \u2013 the reaction to this \u201cforeign body\u201d must be considered. The \n\nsurface of a medical device is the first contact with the biological environment. Upon contact, a series of \n\nbio-recognition processes (such as protein/cell adhesion and inflammatory response) occur between \n\nthe surface of biomaterials and the biological environment [1-5]. It is evident that such interface defines \n\nwhether the device will be accepted or rejected by the body, and therefore the surface properties play \n\nan extremely important role in its success. \n\nSurface engineering has been commonly achieved through techniques such as plasma [6], polymer \n\ngrafting [7], micro/nanofabrication [8] and Langmuir-Blodgett [9]. Each one of them, different as they \n\nmay seem, often aim for the same goal: to modify the characteristics of a selected surface while \n\nretaining the properties of the bulk materials. Using the example of artificial prosthesis, the surface \n\ncould be improved for better biointegration through the enhancement of its antimicrobial properties, \n\nbiocompatibility, degradation resistance and drug loading capability [10-12], while preserving the native \n\nmechanical properties. \n\nIt is notable how surface modification in biomedical applications has motivated so much interest in the \n\nscientific community. Nowadays, modifying a surface is no longer limited to the improvement of an \n\nimplant\u2019s integration. Technological ramifications have allowed producing surfaces that respond to \n\nstimuli, tune cell adhesion, mineralize and adjust the permeability of active agents\u2019 carriers [13-16]. In \n\nparticular, surfaces containing nano- or micro-scale features in a well-controlled manner have been \n\nshown to influence cellular adhesion and metabolism [17]. In this sense, surface modification has also \n\nbecome a synonym of \u201ccontrol\u201d. \n\nTaking Nature as the greatest of inspirations, scientists and engineers have developed many biomimetic \n\nconcepts based on the constant evolutionary improvement of designs and functionalities of natural \n\noccurring materials [18]. One example is the layered organization found in natural materials, such as \n\nthe case of nacre found in the shells of sea animals. Nacre consists in a hierarchical and layered \n\nstructure of calcium minerals capable of dissipating high amounts of mechanical energy [19-21]. In an \n\nattempt to mimic natural layered structures, a strategy consisting in the alternate adsorption of \n\npolyelectrolytes onto solid surfaces \u2013 polyanions and polycations \u2013 was introduced. In this process, two \n\nor more constituents can be added on top of a substrate sequentially with nanometric precision as \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n40 \n\nmany times as desired, until stacks of numerous layers give rise to multilayered thin films. This concept \n\nwas first introduced by Iller [22] in 1966, who assembled alternate layers of positively and negatively \n\ncharged colloidal particles (such as silica and alumina) onto solid smooth surfaces. Later, Decher and \n\nHong [23] expanded this concept using anionic and cationic bipolar amphiphiles containing rigid \n\nbiphenyl cores, and adsorbed them alternately onto a positively charged planar surface. They \n\ndemonstrated the construction of a film with 35 amphiphile layers accounting for a total thickness of \n\n170 nm. After completion of their follow-up work [24,25] this strategy became known as layer-by-layer \n\n(LbL). Since its introduction, it has become one of the most prominent surface engineering strategies in \n\nmaterials science, capable of providing a reliable, easy, versatile and cost-effective way of tuning \n\ninterfaces. Furthermore, a wide variety of constituents can be selected. The only requirement is that \n\nmultipoint interactions \u2013 such as electrostatic contacts, van der Walls forces, and hydrogen bonding \u2013 \n\nexist between each of them to enable their sequential adsorption [1,26-30]. It is a simple and versatile \n\ntechnique that allows producing robust coatings, even in substrates with convoluted and three \n\ndimensional geometries. Harmful solvents (e.g., crosslinkers, organic solvents) and harsh processing \n\nconditions (e.g., high temperatures, extreme pH values) are seldom required, making LbL an attractive \n\ntechnique for biological-based applications. Specialized biomaterials and ligands, such as cell adhesion \n\nenhancers, may be used in order to mimic biological structures and functions, rendering a substrate \n\nmore instructive for cell behavior [27,31]. Multilayered films can also act as drug reservoirs: active \n\nagents may be embedded in the multilayer constitution while preserving their bioactivity, especially \n\nwhen the protection of drugs until their delivery is desired [32,33]. \n\nDue to the broad scope and fast development of LbL, dozens of review articles have contributed to this \n\ntopic in the last decade. In 2006, Kotov and coworkers [30] focused on a comprehensive review about \n\nthe bioactivity of multilayer films for biomedical applications, such as superhydrophobic surfaces, \n\nbiosensors, drug delivery, protein/cell adhesion, mediation of cellular functions and implantable \n\nmaterials. These authors estimated that LbL could be extrapolated to the third dimension in the \n\nfollowing years in order to conceive scaffolds with specific embedded growth factors, receptors, or \n\nligands. Their expectations have been met as several works have showed the production of complex \n\ngeometrical structures using this technology. Another review by Picart and coworkers [1] in 2010 \n\nreminded us of the fundamentals of LbL and how the experimental conditions affect the final properties \n\nof a multilayer films. Namely, the mechanism of exponential growth, which describes an alternative non-\n\nlinear model of thickness growth per layer, was reflected upon. In 2012, Tong, Song and Gao [34] \n\nreviewed the construction of spherical containers (namely capsules) for drug delivery, biosensing and \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n41 \n\nconfining chemical reactions, showing how LbL has surpassed the simple idea of improving interfaces \n\nand creating functional surfaces. \n\nIn this review, we intend to discuss the state-of-the-art developments of LbL-based strategies, especially \n\nthose with applicability in the biomedical field. Through selected recent examples from the literature, we \n\nwill discuss how LbL has been established as a conventional surface modification technique in little \n\nmore than 20 years thanks to this technique\u2019s capability to address a wide range of biomedical \n\napplications. Simultaneously, it is our intention to open the question of whether LbL, as it stands now, \n\nsurpasses other existent technologies and what potential is still reserved for the future development of \n\nmultilayered biomedical devices with value for biomedical applications. \n\n2.2 Fundamentals of the layer-by-layer technique \n\n2.2.1 Layer-by-Layer as a tool for surface modification \n\nLbL adsorption relies in the interaction between two or more distinct materials that possess \n\ncomplementary interactions, i.e. that the properties of both materials result in their mutual attraction. \n\nThe most exploited buildup mechanism of multilayer films is the assembly driven by electrostatic \n\ninteractions of oppositely charged components, as depicted in Figure 2.1.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1. Schematics of layer-by-layer adsorption of polyelectrolytes based on an electrostatic \n\nmechanism deposition. The procedure is based on the contact of the substrate with a solution with an \n\noppositely charged polymer. In the depicted example, negatively charged round substrates are \n\nsubmerged in an aqueous solution of a polycation, followed by a solution containing a polyanion. Each \n\nadsorption stage is separated by a rinsing step, to remove loosely adsorbed molecules. \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n42 \n\nBesides electrostatic assembly, constructing multilayer films may rely on short-range interactions, such \n\nas van der Walls forces and hydrogen bonding [35-37]. Nowadays it is acknowledged that the gain in \n\nentropy due to the release of counterions plays a key role in the LbL adsorption process. Its outcome is \n\noften the organization of the layers in a more coiled and interdigitated conformation, leading the \n\npolyelectrolyte molecules to lose degrees of freedom [38-40]. \n\nMany types of charged molecules and nano-objects are suitable for deposition by electrostatic \n\ninteractions, from nanoparticles [41-43], carbon nanotubes [44,45], clay platelets [46], \n\ndendrimers [47,48], polysaccharides [49-51], polypeptides [52-54], nucleic acids [55,56] and viral \n\ncomponents [57,58]. Special emphasis has been given to synthetic polyelectrolytes, such as the widely \n\ninvestigated poly(styrene sulfonate)/poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PSS/PAH) system \u2013 considered so \n\nfar as a model of multilayered thin films [1]. Synthetic materials are usually highly versatile materials \n\nwith well-defined structures with tailored properties, such as molecular weight and charge density [59]. \n\nThanks to their tailored properties these systems have been used as a means to determine the \n\ninfluence of several construction conditions involved in the LbL buildup. For example, it is known that \n\nvarying the pH of weak polyelectrolytes also varies the protonation state of their ionizable groups, this \n\nway influencing the availability of charged groups; additionally, a moderate ionic strength can help \n\nreducing electrostatic repulsion between charged groups and favor electrostatic assembly [60-62]. \n\nAnother parameter is temperature, which increases the mobility of the adsorbed molecules and the \n\nchances of finding more energetically optimal binding sites at the deposition site [63]. \n\nSynthetic materials have served their purpose, but for biomedical applications materials that exhibit \n\nbiological features should be more appropriate. Natural materials are intricate structures which have \n\nrisen from hundreds of millions of years of evolution. Comparing to our current technology, Nature was \n\nable to conceive structures more multifaceted than man-made materials, forming complex arrays, \n\nhierarchical structures and multifunctionality [11,64,65]. Natural materials often avoid triggering \n\nchronic or immunological reactions and toxicity, and are therefore appropriate multifunctional \n\ningredients for constructing multilayer films and coatings with improved interface with the biological \n\nenvironment [66]. \n\n2.2.2 Moving LbL toward faster production \n\nThe number of parameters that may influence the buildup of multilayer films is broad: LbL requires \n\ncomplementarity between the multilayer constituents, but the strength of the forces driving the \n\nassembly may be influenced by other parameters. Intrinsic properties \u2013 such as the molecular weight of \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n43 \n\npolymers or size of inorganic particles, charge density and polarity \u2013 and external properties \u2013 such as \n\ntemperature, pH of the solvent and ionic strength \u2013 may facilitate or hinder a constituent\u2019s adsorption. \n\nThe result depends on the original properties of the materials. For instance, varying the pH of a weak \n\npolyelectrolyte above or below its acidic constant (pKa) will greatly impact on its overall charge density \n\nand ultimately electrostatic interactions [67,68]. Therefore, the construction of multilayer films based on \n\nnew and not much used constituents may require a thorough preliminary screening process. \n\nNonetheless, as soon as this temporal hardship is overcome, the optimal conditions will be determined \n\nand they can be applied in the mass-production robust nanostructured coatings. \n\nDespite all the presented advantages of LbL, this technique has one fundamental drawback: it is \n\ngenerally a time-consuming process. To construct a multilayer film, the adsorption time to assemble a \n\nsingle layer may vary with the nature of the constituents. A standard time of 10 minutes is usually \n\nacceptable, plus a rinsing step that may take an equivalent time scale. Surprisingly, the effect of \n\nreducing the processing times (sacrificing some mass deposition) was never properly addressed as a \n\nway to accelerate the fabrication of the films. In a scale-up perspective, and when large numbers of \n\nlayers are required, automated devices have been proposed for the production of multilayer films. The \n\nmost common devices are dipping machines, which allow parallel construction of several films at once. \n\nThey function similarly to manual dipping in every aspect but its automated nature permits not only the \n\nrepetition of multiple adsorption cycles over long construction times but also the parallel assembly of \n\nmultiple films. This way, thicker multilayer films with several micrometers can be obtained in high \n\nquantities [69-71]. \n\nOne could argue that, although many films can be fabricated in parallel, the fabrication time is still too \n\nlong. An alternative procedure is a sputtering-based strategy which, rather than dipping, sprays the \n\nsurface. The fabrication time of the latter has been reported to be greatly shortened due to enhanced \n\nadsorption by the spray pressure. Schlenoff, Dubas and Farhat [72] showed the construction of \n\npoly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PDADMAC/PSS) multilayer films by \n\nspraying the respective solutions onto silicon wafers. For that purpose, they used a sprayer as simple as \n\na hand-operated \u201cplant mister\u201d, making it possible for each layer to be adsorbed in a matter of seconds. \n\nTheir morphology, uniformity, and chemical composition were similar to coatings made by dipping. \n\nIzquierdo et al. [70] followed a similar spraying strategy for the assembly of PSS/poly(allylamine) \n\nhydrochloride (PAH) multilayers, where they reiterated the findings of the previous authors. \n\nAlthough the process of LbL started as being an inherently slow processing method that requires a \n\nlengthy preliminary screening stage, these drawbacks have been addressed and reduced to a minimum \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n44 \n\nin the last decade [73]. Furthermore, the use of automated devices, including unconventional \n\nsputtering-based approaches, have made it possible to construct multilayers a lot faster (about a factor \n\nof 250 in the latter example) and are appropriate for future industrial mass-production with low risk of \n\nstock shortage. \n\n2.3 Surfaces with specialized properties \n\n2.3.1 Surfaces containing adhesive constituents \n\nMultilayer films and coatings can exhibit higher forms of specialized properties by selecting functional \n\nmaterials as their components. One such example is the use of polymers that are known to exhibit \n\nadhesive properties in nature. Without much effort, a great source of adhesive natural materials can be \n\nfound in the sea, such as the polysaccharides chitosan (CHI) and alginate (ALG). CHI is derived from \n\nchitin, found in the exoskeleton of shellfish or crustaceans, like shrimp and crabs, and ALG is a \n\nstructural component found in brown algae. These two polysaccharides share a marine origin and \n\nexhibit important properties for biomedical applications \u2013 biocompatible, adhesive, nontoxic, \n\nbacteriostatic, fungistatic, antimicrobial and hemostatic [66,74] \u2013 which proved to be useful in drug \n\ndelivery, implants and wound dressings [75-77]. Another strategy to obtain adhesive materials is to \n\nproduce synthetic analogues based on natural systems, such as the adhesive proteins rich in 3,4-\n\ndihydroxy-phenylalanine (DOPA). DOPA, also a precursor of dopamine, can be found in the threads \n\nexpressed by mussels, which have been shown to attach to many types of inorganic and organic \n\nsurfaces thanks to the exhibition of catechol hydroxyl groups [78,79]. Catechol-modified biomimetic \n\npolymers can be used to aid in the construction of the multilayer film itself. As demonstrated by \n\nLee et al. [80] catechol-functionalized poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) and hyaluronic acid (HA) adsorbed could \n\nbe adsorbed onto any sort of substrate, namely poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE), silicon and gold. \n\nKarabulut et al. [81] exploited the iron(III) (Fe3+) crosslinking mechanism of catechol groups to tune the \n\nmechanical properties of films made of carboxymethylated cellulose nanofibrils modified with dopamine. \n\nThe adhesive forces were measured using a silica probe demonstrating that, in the presence of Fe\n3+\n\n, \n\ndopamine-functionalized films are more resistant to deformation than films prepared from unmodified \n\nnanofibrils. Wu et al. [82] prepared multilayers of PAH and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), the latter modified \n\nwith dopamine, and crosslinked the films by an oxidation reaction mediated by sodium periodate for \n\nbetter stability. These coatings could be peeled by a sodium hydroxide solvent, providing undamaged \n\nfree-standing membranes. Curiously, DOPA and its analogues have been used as a mechanism to \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n45 \n\nimprove the construction of LbL films, rather than increasing adhesiveness to surrounding tissues. It is \n\nhowever expectable that the adhesiveness of such films is indeed augmented, judging by how catechol-\n\nmodified gels and membranes behave.[83-85] \n\nAdhesive materials can be found in places other than the sea. For instance, Costa et al. [86] assembled \n\nmultilayer films made of CHI and phosphonate-modified levan, a fructan exopolysaccharide produced by \n\nthe halophilic bacterium Halomonas smyrnensis sp. nov. AAD6T. The adhesiveness of this polymer \n\ncomes from their hydroxyl groups that form strong adhesive bonds with various substrates [87,88]. The \n\nadhesiveness of these films was verified by lap shear bonding stress between two overlapped films with \n\n100 bilayers assembled onto glass slides, meaning that no peeling was attempted. In comparison to \n\nCHI/ALG films used as controls \u2013 two polysaccharides often regarded as good natural adhesives \u2013 the \n\ndetachment force of the levan-functionalized surfaces was about 3 times higher than the control \n\n(2.5\u00b10.3 MPa and 0.9\u00b10.1 MPa, respectively). The cell adhesion for 24 h conducted using a fibroblast \n\ncell line also showed that cells were sensitive to the incorporation of levan and adhered mostly to these \n\ncoatings (110 cells?mm\n-2\n\n in comparison to 20 cells?mm\n-2\n\n in the control). \n\nThe technology of LbL films using adhesive materials has the potential to address issues related to \n\nwound healing, namely in the performance of medical adhesives. Many synthetic adhesives currently \n\napproved present limitations, which include poor adhesion in the presence of biological fluids, allergic \n\nresponse and inflammation [89]. Therefore, the use of natural adhesive constituents may help in the \n\ndevelopment of wound healing dressings and surgical biomaterials with improved adhesiveness to \n\norgans and tissues. \n\n2.3.2 Mineralization control \n\nBone regeneration and integration is probably one of the most researched areas in biomedical \n\nengineering and a variety of systems have been proposed for this purpose [90-92]. Using the recurrent \n\nexample of orthopedic bone implants, coatings that exhibit biomineralization capability may provide a \n\nfavorable environment for osteogenesis and a bone-friendly interface between the implant and host\u2019s \n\nbone [93,94]. \n\nBiomineralization can be achieved following two strategies: (i) addition of inorganic components (e.g. \n\nsilicate-based particles), or (ii) incorporation of osteoinductive molecules (e.g. polymers and proteins). \n\nAn example of (i) are bioactive glasses. These materials have been subject of much research in the last \n\ndecades because when in contact with physiological or simulated body fluids they form a surface \n\napatite layer.  Such apatite layer permits an adjusted bonding of the implant to bone in vivo, preventing \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n46 \n\nthe formation of a fibrous capsule and promoting a stronger osseo-integration. Ultimately, this layer can \n\nbind to the collagen of connective tissue cells, like osteoblasts [95]. In the case of (ii), bone \n\nmorphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are well-known growth factors which have been widely used for bone \n\nrepair and are known to stimulate the proliferation, migration and differentiation of stem cells [96]. \n\nOne would not expect LbL devices to be used as systems aimed to integrate or regenerate a hard tissue \n\nsuch as bone, since most polymeric multilayer films do not exhibit mechanical properties equivalent to \n\nthe bone. However, it may be used to engineer an appropriate interface between an implantable device \n\nand bone, since LbL allows incorporating distinct classes of materials in their structure. Thus, strategies \n\ncan be devised to convert a \u201csoft\u201d multilayer to the purpose of triggering biomineralization. \n\nCouto, Alves and Mano [41] constructed multilayer films that contained bioglass nanoparticles as an \n\ninorganic ingredient that provided biomineralization capability in vitro. The synthesized nanoparticles \n\nhad a charge of -25 mV, which enabled them to interact with the polycationic CHI via electrostatic \n\ninteractions. Using a quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM), they demonstrated that films up to 10 bilayers \n\ncould be successfully assembled. Using a simulated body fluid (SBF), they showed that it was possible \n\nto induce the formation of apatite crystalline layers, similar to the ones found in the inorganic \n\ncomponent of bone. The mineralization was also more pronounced with increasing number of layers. \n\nFukui and Fujimoto [97] described the conception of a nanocapsule templated in phospholipids that \n\nencapsulated phosphate ions. The phospholipids were coated using CHI, dextran sulfate or DNA and \n\nthen incubated in a solution containing calcium ions. They demonstrated that changes in the surface \n\nchemistry could influence the counterion diffusion and therefore the biomineralization rate (Figure 2.2). \n\nDespite the efforts made so far, biomineralization-inducing multilayers still remain a largely unexplored \n\napproach. Most likely the reason lies within the fact that immobilizing particles inside a multilayer \n\nstructure is not an easy task. While a polymeric film may have only a few nanometers but an \n\ninterpenetrated structure, a nanoparticle can be very large in comparison. Thus, it is likely that the \n\nproduction of biomineralizing surfaces will be limited to the loading of osteoconductive agents. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2.

[98] took another approach by adding bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) \n\nand fibronectin to a CHI/gelatin (GEL) multilayer formulation. Disks and rods of a titanium alloy were \n\nfirst subjected to the adsorption of a layer of GEL conjugated with dopamine \u2013 a fine example of how \n\ndopamine and its analogues can be used as the starting layer of any substrate, as previously \n\ndemonstrated by Lee et al. [80] Next a combination of CHI, unmodified GEL, recombinant human bone \n\nmorphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) and fibronectin was used. The in vitro release of rhBMP-2 showed \n\nthat 30% of the initial adsorbed amount was released within 2 hours and around 50% after 6 days. After \n\n2 weeks, around 20% was still retained at the surface. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were seeded \n\nonto these substrates up to 21 days and showed higher production levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), \n\nmineralization and expression of osteogenic genes compared to a control of bare titanium substrate. In \n\nvivo studies using a rabbit femur model were carried out up to 12 weeks and were shown to increase \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n48 \n\nthe density and formation of bone. More examples of multilayered systems containing BMPs will \n\nprovided later in this review, in the context of drug delivery systems (Section 2.5.3). \n\n2.3.3 Stimuli-responsive surfaces \n\nHigher degrees of functionalization can be achieved by introducing stimuli-responsive constituents. \n\nUsually, a surface \u2013 modified or not \u2013 is perceived as a static interface, that is, no structural changes \n\noccur upon switching environmental parameters. However, stimuli-responsive surfaces are dynamic and \n\nundergo conformational changes upon variations of specific external factors. An elegant example found \n\nin Nature exhibiting such mechanism is skin. Skin is the largest organ of the human body and it can be \n\nperceived as the ideal multifunctional membrane that responds to every variation in its environment \u2013 \n\nheat/cold, humidity, chemical/mechanical stress and even light [99]. Exploiting external stimuli has \n\nbeen extensively researched for several devices, such as grafted surfaces and hydrogels [100], but not \n\nas much in multilayer systems for controlling biological events, like cell attachment/detachment \n\nmechanisms. Some works described films made of CHI and elastin-like recombinamers (ELRs), a \n\nrecombinant class of elastin-like polymers (ELPs). ELRs are genetically modified polypeptides that \n\nundergo a phase transition when in solution dependent on temperature: below a critical transition \n\ntemperature, the free polymer chains adopt random coil conformations; above it, they fold into an \n\norganized structure known as ?-spiral [101]. Using this polysaccharide/polypeptide formulation, both \n\nbilayer coatings [102] and multiple responsive multilayers [27] were made. In the latter, variations of \n\npH, ionic strength and temperature triggered a transition of wettability between a moderately \n\nhydrophobic character (contact angle around 70\u00ba) to a superhydrophilic surface (contact angle of 0\u00ba). \n\nThese variations were observed above pH 11, ionic strength 1.25 M in NaCl, and temperature of 50\u00baC. \n\nThe genetic nature of ELRs permitted the inclusion of the cell adhesion sequence arginine-glycine-\n\naspartic acid (RGD), the minimal sequence required for recognition by cell membrane integrins [103]. \n\nThe adhesion of osteoblast-like cells was higher in these films than in films ending in CHI or a \n\nscrambled nonfunctional RDG analogue. Although cell adhesion was influenced by the exhibition of \n\nspecialized bioactive groups, the possibility to use external stimuli to control the attachment or \n\ndetachment of cells was not explored. The reason lies in the fact that the variation of the surface \n\nproperties evaluated in terms of wettability variations only occurred at values that are simply not \n\nsuitable for biological experiments. However, in another report from the same group [104], a multilayer \n\nfilm made of ALG and CHI modified with poly(N - isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) was developed to \n\nreproduce the cell-sheet technology developed by Okano and coworkers [105], which allows a thin layer \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n49 \n\nof cells to be harvested for reculture, transplantation or differentiation. Human osteoblast-like cells were \n\nseeded until confluence was achieved at 37\u00baC and the temperature was lowered afterwards to 4\u00baC. \n\nCells started to peel and detached from the surface as a thin layer, which occurs due to the extension \n\nof the PNIPAAm chains and increase of hydrophilicity. These cell-sheets could be harvested and seeded \n\nagain in a different culture support to demonstrate their viability. A similar approach was demonstrated \n\nby Zahn et al. [106] who used an ion-induced detachment of myoblast cell layers through the eroding \n\neffect of ferrocyanide on PLL/HA multilayers. \n\nTemperature, ionic strength, and pH can be easily manipulated to influence the response of \n\n\u201cintelligent\u201d materials contained within the LbL formulation. However, sharp variations of the last two \n\nmay be aggressive to cells as they are not capable of withstanding hypotonic/hypertonic and extreme \n\nacid/alkaline conditions. Temperature changes, on the other hand, are usually more tolerated by cells \n\nfor temperatures up to 37\u00baC,  and the example of cell-sheet technology is a fine example of that [107]. \n\nAnother stimulus that may be exploited is light. The use of light would be a convenient way of \n\ncontrolling a surface\u2019s properties since it can be easily emitted or blocked on demand. Moreover, \n\nbiomedical applications could benefit from its noninvasive character, capability of deep tissue \n\npenetration and fine spatial control over its intensity [108]. One example of light-responsive films is the \n\nwork of Ahmad, Saqib and Barret [109], who developed films containing anionic azobenzene-\n\nfunctionalized polyelectrolytes. The polyelectrolytes were distinct and exhibited different \n\nhydrophilicity/hydrophobicity character, which ultimately reflected upon the ultraviolet (UV)-visible \n\nabsorption spectrum of each film. Azobenzenes linked to hydrophilic groups exhibited higher absorption \n\nmaxima (423\u2013440 nm) than azobenzenes linked to hydrophobic groups (407\u2013414 nm), in both cases \n\nvalues slightly higher than the maximum UV wavelength of 400 nm. Multilayer systems that respond to \n\nlight are seldom referred in the literature. This may be related to the fact that most light-sensitive \n\nmolecules respond mostly to light in the UV spectrum, which is harmful to biological cells. Nevertheless, \n\nthe presented example shows how the inclusion of light-responsive groups linked to distinct radical \n\ngroups may help shifting the maximum absorption wavelengths toward the visible spectrum. \n\n2.4 Coating of implantable devices \n\nThe modification of implantable medical devices is perhaps the most evident application resulting from \n\nLbL strategies in the biomedical field. The versatility of LbL and the possibility of developing surfaces \n\nwith specialized properties have already been applied as a means to improve the integration and to \n\nadjust the biorecognition of implantable devices, such as prosthesis and stents. Currently, most of the \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n50 \n\nimprovements in the performance of an implant are possible thanks to the development of more \n\nanatomically-shaped geometries. This is particularly evident in the case of bone implants, which are \n\nincreasingly easier to attach to the bone and provide more comfort for the patients [110-112]. Besides \n\ndesign, it is known that an efficient integration is determined mainly by the surface characteristics of the \n\nimplantable device (surface microstructure and chemical/biochemical nature), which influence the \n\nsubsequent adhesion of proteins and cells. It is common to find metallic implants (e.g. steel or titanium) \n\nduring surgical interventions [3,10,113]. However, it is difficult to assume that a metal with no \n\nresemblance to biological materials provides appropriate integration and recognition by the body. \n\nTherefore, LbL constitutes an adequate methodology to modify the surface of implantable devices, as it \n\ncould be employed regardless of their geometry. \n\n2.4.1 Coating of synthetic implantable devices \n\nMost metallic alloys are negatively charged, like other common materials found outside the medical \n\nfield (e.g., glass), and thus provide support for the formation of a multilayer coating by adsorbing a \n\nprimer polycationic layer [30]. Zhankovich et al. [114] proposed to coat a titanium alloy using multilayer \n\ncoatings of either CHI/GEL or CHI/HA to improve osseo-integration. Their study was based on prior \n\nconclusions by the same group that had shown showed that while CHI/GEL coatings stimulated the in \n\nvitro adhesion and proliferation of human osteoblasts, CHI/HA coatings reduced it [115]. So, using a \n\nrat tibia model, shear strength analysis did not show any biomechanical difference between the coated \n\nimplants and a control of uncoated implants after 3 weeks. However, after 8 weeks, compared to the \n\ntitanium alloy control, shear strength was increased up to 1.84-fold and 1.86-fold for CHI/GEL and \n\nCHI/HA, respectively, indicating improved osseo-integration of the implant to the surrounding tissue. \n\nInterestingly, these results contradicted their expectation to observe significantly higher integration with \n\nGEL-coated implants. The explanation to this similar osseo-integration observed in the rat tibia model \n\ncould be due to the long-term exposure of the coating to a biological environment. This exposure could \n\nhave led to the partial dissolution of the outer HA layer and its inhibitory effect decreased. CHI would \n\nthen come in contact with the biological tissue and promote osteoblast proliferation. Both works \n\ndemonstrate the potential of LbL modified implants in orthopedic implant surgery, even using very \n\nsimple biopolymers, where a regulated osteointegration is desirable to avoid early loosening, especially \n\nwhen osteoporotic fractures are involved. \n\nAiming for the treatment of coronary artery diseases, stents have been coated with polymeric \n\nfilms [116,117]. Stents with no modification can trigger thrombosis and cytokines secretion, leading to \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n51 \n\nin-stent restenosis \u2013 a particular refractory form of neointimal hyperplasia [118]. Schweizer et al. [119] \n\ncoated nitinol stents with a multilayer formulation of CHI and heparin, a well-known glucosaminoglycan \n\nwith anticoagulant properties. First, tubes made of the stent bulk material were coated and bent in a \n\n37\u00ba angle, showing that the LbL coating could be maintained and withstand mechanical loading. Then, \n\nthey conducted a mineralization study by immersion in a calcium nitrate and ammonium phosphate \n\nbath in agitation for one week. The formation of calcium phosphate particles with less than 100 nm was \n\nobserved in the coated stents, while in the control large microcrystals were formed. Large calcium \n\nphosphate crystals may be dangerous if released and transported into the blood stream, but \n\nnanocrystals are not expected to trigger high thrombogenicity. Furthermore, they may help to increase \n\nthe mechanical stability of the assembled multilayers. In the same study, titanium samples were coated \n\nand studied simultaneously. Surprisingly, crystals on the order of 10 ?m were observed on coated \n\nsamples, much larger than in the case of coated nitinol ones. This conclusion alerts to the role of the \n\nsubstrate used, since it is likely that synergistic effects occur between not only the coating constituents \n\nbut also between the assembled coating and the substrate\u2019s chemistry. The use of CHI/heparin films \n\nmay also result in antibacterial activity and suppression of blood clot formation, respectively. In fact, \n\nMeng et al. [120] had previously shown that stainless steel coronary stents with the same coating has a \n\nbetter hemocompatibility and more efficient re-endotelyzation than bare metallic samples, using a \n\nporcine coronary injury model. \n\nLin et al. [121] tested the hypothesis that a stent that promotes the adhesion of endothelial cells \u2013 \n\neither circulating in the blood or migrating from neighbor tissues \u2013 facilitates its integration and reduces \n\nrisk of stent failure. Stainless steel stents were coated with heparin/collagen multilayers, which could be \n\nor not be further functionalized with an anti-CD34 antibody. Both types of samples and a control of \n\nuncoated stents were implanted in rabbit femoral arteries. While no significant difference of neointimal \n\nhyperplasia was observed between uncoated metal stents and heparin/collagen multilayer modified \n\nstents, neointimal hyperplasia on the anti-CD34 antibody-functionalized multilayer coated stents was \n\nsignificantly inhibited and provided an accelerated adhesion of both vascular and endothelial cells \n\n(Figure 2.3). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2.

[121] Copyright 2010, Elsevier. \n\n \n\nPost-surgical infection due to bacterial contamination constitutes another major issue that leads to \n\nimplant failure. Bacteria can form biofilms on the surface of implants, therefore compromising the \n\nperformance of the device [122]. Therefore, it is crucial that initial bacteria adhesion to an implant\u2019s \n\nsurface is prevented. Building multilayer films that exhibit antifouling properties is a possible solution for \n\nthis problem. Rendering a surface non-fouling can serve as immuno-\u2018\u2018camouflage\u2019\u2019 to prevent immune \n\nrejection of implanted biomaterials or to enhance the efficiency of injected drug delivery vehicles [123-\n\n125]. Reisch et al. [126] demonstrated that films containing PAH and a PAA containing \n\nphosphorylcholine side chains resisted the adsorption of albumin, which served as an estimation of \n\ncellular adhesion. Caruso and coworkers [127] demonstrated that PSS/PAH multilayer films with a \n\nterminal layer of PSS-b- poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) were up to five-fold more resistant to bovine serum \n\nalbumin (BSA) adsorption than PSS-terminated films. Moreover, the binding of coated polystyrene \n\nparticles to human colorectal cancer cells was reduced 6.5-fold in comparison to native PSS-terminated \n\nparticles. However, since LbL allows the inclusion of active agents to the formulation of a multilayer \n\ncoating, the most straightforward strategy to avoid deleterious effects caused by microorganisms is \n\nperhaps the addition of antimicrobial agents. For instance, Hammond and coworkers [128] coated \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n53 \n\nsilicon substrates with N,N - dodecyl,methyl-poly(ethylenimine) (DMPEI) as a polycation with microbicidal \n\nactivity and a polyanion, such as PAA. The surfaces proved to be lethal against airborne and waterborne \n\nbacteria (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus) and viruses (influenza virus, strain H1N1). \n\n2.4.2 Cells as supports for the assembly of multilayer coatings \n\nCell therapies based on bioencapsulation strategies have recently found utility in the treatment of \n\nnumerous pathologies, such as for diabetes, bone and cartilage defects, and cancer. Usually, ALG is \n\nthe most frequently employed biomaterial for the encapsulation of cells due to its abundance, water \n\nsolubility, mild gelling properties, high biocompatibility, and resemblance to the natural extracellular \n\nmatrix (ECM). However, the diffusion of essential molecules in hydrogels is usually less efficient than in \n\nliquefied environments, which may compromise cell survivability [129,130]. \n\nDeveloping a device that provides immune protection and selective permeability is an important and \n\nambitious step in the development of an effective encapsulating barrier [131-133]. In the field of LbL \n\nimplantable devices, cells or cell agglomerates can be used as suitable substrates for the buildup of \n\nmultilayers. Therefore, cell surface engineering offers great potential to improve clinical outcomes \n\nassociated with this promising class of therapeutic devices. \n\nAn application that would benefit greatly of such approach would be the treatment of diabetes. The \n\nwidespread clinical solution for this disease is that of islet transplantation, but this brings problems such \n\nas immune rejection, inflammation, thrombosis, hypoxia and weakened revascularization [134-136], \n\nleading ultimately to the destruction of the encapsulated cells. Krol et al. [137] demonstrated that \n\nLangerhan cells could be effectively coated with the polycations PAH or PDADMAC. Coating pancreatic \n\ncells with multilayers is an alternative to the conventional microencapsulation approaches within highly \n\nviscous ultrapure alginate droplets [138-140]. By taking advantage of the negative charge provided by \n\nthe peri-islet capsule, polycations could be adsorbed to the membrane of the cells, followed by the \n\npolyanionic PSS. The multilayer coating succeeded in providing immunological protection to the cells. \n\nThey also retained their insulin secretory function in vitro up to 4 days and diffusion was allowed \n\nthrough the coating. Furthermore, insulin release increased when high quantities of glucose were \n\npresent. This is a very promising approach of LbL for the development of effective cellular therapies, \n\nwhich seemed promising to solve diabetes related problems, and their application in vivo was most \n\nanticipated. \n\nRecently, Wilson et al. [141] presented a polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) comprised of ALG and \n\npoly(L-lysine) (PLL)-g-PEG to coat the surface of pancreatic islet cells. The surface engineered islets \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n54 \n\nwere introduced through the portal vein and into the liver microvasculature in diabetic mice. Two weeks \n\nafter transplantation, 47% of the mice receiving the coated islets converted from a diabetic to an \n\neuglycemic state, while 25% of mice that received uncoated cells showed improvements. \n\nGiven these examples, one can see that LbL-based strategies have the potential to improve the \n\nintegration of diverse types of implants. It can be easily applied to existing biomedical devices implants \n\nand even to biological materials like cells for transplantation purposes. The possibility to introduce \n\nfunctionalized and bioactive materials to a surface may lead ultimately to a good integration in a living \n\nsystem and constitutes an advantage in comparison to other conventional techniques (e.g., temperature \n\nand plasma treatments). The possibility to coat biological structures directly is unusual and may have a \n\ngreat impact in the management of cellular viability prior and after implantation. This technology may \n\nbe extended to develop cellular strategies, for instance in the form of cell infusions that may be injected \n\nintravenously for delivery to targeted tissues, such as the heart, or with other therapeutic functions, \n\nsuch as immunoregulation or systemic production of growth factors. \n\n2.5 Engineering biomedical devices \n\n2.5.1 Construction of films for wound healing \n\nWith LbL, one can develop films with just a couple of layers or hundreds, with obvious implications in \n\nthe films\u2019 thickness. Thin coatings with several nanometers or membranes that may reach tens of \n\nmicrometers can be obtained this way. When considering the production of membranes, film casting \n\nand hot-melt extrusion are the most recurrent used techniques [142]. However, these techniques are \n\nnot completely compatible with biological applications: the use of organic solvents in film casting and \n\nthe addition of plasticizers in hot-melt extrusion may cause adverse reactions when introduced in a \n\nbiological environment. Since LbL-based strategies disregard the use of such agents, thick multilayer \n\nfilms appropriate for biological applications can be constructed. \n\n2.5.1.1 Development of nanostructured substrate-free membranes \n\nMultilayers adhere strongly to the underlying substrate and usually cannot be harvested without risk of \n\ndamaging the film. Thus, many strategies were developed to produce films that could be detached, \n\nwhich are usually referred to as free-standing films. These free-standing films resemble membranes but, \n\nunlike conventional membranes, they are nanostructured and exhibit nanoscale precision thanks to \n\ntheir organization in layers. Such a device offers all the advantages of multilayered coatings and is \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n55 \n\nuseful for applications such as wound healing and drug delivery, with the added benefit of manual \n\nhandling [143-145]. \n\nA typical approach to fabricate free-standings is through the use of sacrificial layers or substrates that \n\ncan be dissolved after the buildup [42,146,147]. Ott et al. [147] used silicon wafers precoated with PEI \n\nto assemble chemically polymerized polyanions bearing aldehyde groups and polycations with \n\n4-methylpyridinium moieties. After crosslinking, the film could be detached easily from the substrate by \n\nsalty solutions. The salt weakened the PEI interactions with the silicon wafers, after which robust free-\n\nstanding films could be harvested. \n\nUsing salty solutions is preferable to chemical solvents, since the latter may cause both chemical and \n\nphysical changes to the film during this stage. However, even salt may interfere in the internal \n\nstructures of the multilayers [68,148,149]. Consequently, other strategies have been introduced as \n\nalternatives to the solvent-assisted detachment of multilayer films more recently. Larkin et al. [145] \n\nused planar substrates of Teflon and polypropylene to assemble polymeric free-standing films. \n\nPolymeric constituents and these substrates form weak van der Waals interactions, which make it \n\npossible to peel the films safely without risk of damage. The proof-of-concept was demonstrated for 50 \n\nbilayers of CHI/HA, crosslinked by glutaraldehyde to increase their stability in aqueous solutions. A \n\nunique feature of these detachable free-standing films was their optical transparency. The transmission \n\nof light is critical for microscopy observations and makes them suitable to be used as cell culture \n\nsubstrates. Indeed, in that work fibroblasts were seeded and could be observed under light microscopy. \n\nCaridade et al. [150] recently developed CHI and ALG free-standing films assembled on distinct low \n\nsurface energy substrates. In comparison to the work of Larkin et al. [145] no crosslinking was made. \n\nInstead, 100 bilayers were assembled (around 35 ?m). They also exploited the possibility to produce \n\nfree-standing films exhibiting asymmetrical properties, that is, distinct properties in each face of the \n\nmembrane. After the assembly was concluded, one side of the membrane was effectively made of ALG \n\nand the other of CHI. This property is useful if one envisages having two distinct properties in distinct \n\nfaces of the same membrane. In this regard, the in vitro adhesion of myoblasts showed that cells \n\nadhered more to the ALG face (200 cells?mm\n-2\n\n) than to the CHI face (40 cells?mm\n-2\n\n), showing how the \n\nsimple selection of the starting and ending constituents can significantly influence the biological \n\nperformance of free-standing films. \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n56 \n\n2.5.1.2 Healing of tissue defects in vivo \n\nFree-standings may also result from hybrid approaches using LbL together with other techniques. Not \n\nonly that, they can be associated with an additional substrate that helps in the posterior application of \n\nthe membrane to a wound. In this sense, free-standings may serve as protective coating for wounds, \n\nrequiring ultimately that a film is harvested and used independently of the substrate. \n\nThe group of Takeoka and coworkers has developed a LbL-assisted strategy involving spin-coating and \n\ncasting for the purpose of healing wounds in animals. One of their first works reported the use of a \n\n\u201cspin-coating\u201d-assisted-LbL subsequently followed by casting [151]. Shortly, CHI and ALG were \n\nsequentially adsorbed onto spinning silica substrates to obtain a film 75 nm thick. Poly(vinyl alcohol) \n\n(PVA) was cast over the bilayered films and left at room temperature during a cure time of 12 hours. \n\nTogether with this PVA layer, with a thickness around 70 ?m, the CHI/ALG film could be easily peeled \n\nfrom the silica substrates, making it easier to carry and place over a tissue defect (Figure 2.4a). \n\n \n\nb\n\n(a)\n\nc d\n\n \n\nFigure 2.4.

Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n57 \n\nThe authors performed a minimally invasive procedure to repair a visceral pleural defect in beagle dogs: \n\nthe PVA/(CHI/ALG)n complex was placed in contact with the defect. Next PVA was dissolved using non-\n\naggressive aqueous solvents, such as phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Over a period of 24 hours after \n\nthe defect repair, this thin membrane resisted the pressure of respiration and blood circulation, and \n\nwas able to sustain the stress due to ventilation (Figure 2.4b). Problems such as the reduction in the \n\npulmonary tissue volume due to suture, and pulmonary air leakage could benefit from the use of \n\nmultilayer thin films as protective membranes and sealants [152].  Later, this hybrid LbL technique and \n\ningredient formulation was used to develop tetracycline-loaded films with antimicrobial effects in a \n\nmurine cecal punctured model (Figure 2.4c) [153] and nanosheets as a protective membrane for full-\n\nthickness burn-wound infection in a murine model (Figure 2.4d) [154]. Their production differed slightly \n\nfrom the first proposed strategy, in the fact that tetracycline was cast in the opposite face to that of the \n\nPVA, followed by a spin-coated layer of poly(vinyl acetate) and dissolution of PVA. \n\nThese two last examples are particularly important for the translation of such approach to humans. \n\nBurn injuries are perhaps one of the most common skin defects. Such an injury creates a large skin \n\narea which is susceptible to bacterial colonization, leading ultimately to infections, systemic sepsis, \n\nsevere septicemia and, if left untreated, death [155,156]. Full-thickness burn wounds may require \n\ntissue grafting [157]; thus it is important to have an effective protective barrier that protects the wound \n\nuntil grafting is carried out. The necessity for bacterial protection takes greater proportions when \n\nconsidering gastro-intestinal lesions, where the presence of multiple microorganisms may lead to \n\nbacterial peritonitis [158]. The presented examples were able to circumvent such problems and have \n\ngreat potential for future wound treatments in human patients. \n\nAlthough the technology of LbL membranes has the potential to act as wound healing dressings, there \n\nhas been little research on LbL coatings in vivo. Based on the existing animal tests with hybrid \u201cspin \n\ncoating-LbL-casting\u201d technology and on the robustness of films made purely with LbL, its broad \n\napplication may be a matter of time. Additionally, this evolution may benefit from the use of biomimetic \n\napproaches and natural sources of adhesive ingredients (as mentioned in Section 2.3.1) for dressings \n\nwith improved mechanical and biological performances. \n\n2.5.2 Multilayer coatings for enhanced cell adhesion on flat surfaces \n\nThe surface of an implant is the first contact with the biological environment, and its modification \u2013 if \n\nany \u2013 will dictate the extent of its integration and long-term stability. Modifying surfaces is not limited to \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n58 \n\ndevices currently used in surgical practice but also to more sophisticated ones for tissue engineering \n\nand regenerative medicine. \n\nThe versatility of LbL can help achieving better cellular attachment by tuning a variety of factors. One of \n\nthose is the stiffness of the multilayer film. It was demonstrated by Schneider et al. [159] how films of \n\nPLL and HA were assembled and crosslinked with increasing concentrations of a water-soluble \n\ncarbodiimide. Higher concentrations of carbodiimide allowed achieving higher crosslinking degrees and, \n\nconsequently, higher elastic moduli, as well as higher surface roughness. The cellular adhesion was \n\naffected by the stiffness: human chondrosarcoma cells adhered and spread preferentially in stiffer films. \n\nUsing the same mechanism, Phelps et al. [160] assembled films of PLL and polyglycolic acid (PGA) and \n\nselectively crosslinked it by exposing only the outermost layers to carbodiimide. This interface was \n\nturned into a rigid external skin that promoted the adhesion of pre-osteoblast cells, while leaving the \n\ninterior of the film unaffected. Although unexplored, this structure could be useful to encapsulate an \n\nactive agent within. Because the crosslinking is selective and not fully uniform, the deactivation of \n\nembedded bioactive species due to crosslinking may be avoided. \n\nMartins et al. [161] used CHI/ALG films crosslinked with glutaraldehyde, to study the adhesion and \n\nproliferation of osteoblast- and fibroblast-cell lines during 1 week. In the first case, the cells proliferated \n\nin a rate similar to cells seeded onto CHI-ending films, but appeared as more elongated and with a \n\nhigher metabolic activity. In the case of fibroblast-like cells, the proliferation was inhibited in crosslinked \n\nfilms. The results of these authors show that films with higher stiffness are not always clearly beneficial \n\nto cells and that different cell types may behave differently when contacting with different substrates. In \n\nfact, the authors justified that the reduction of positive charges due to CHI crosslinking affected both the \n\nattachment and adhesion of this cell line \u2013 L929 human fibroblast-like cells \u2013 which are known to favor \n\ntheir adhesion. \n\nThe addition of bioactive compounds is another form of tuning the adhesion and metabolism of cells in \n\na surface. Lee and Kotov [162] incorporated delta-like 1 Notch ligands (DL-1) at the surface of PEM \n\nfilms. The Notch ligands stimulated hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to differentiate into T-cell \n\nlymphocytes and progressively develop their own ECM. Gribova et al. [31] developed PLL/PGA films to \n\nstudy the effect of the stiffness and the exhibition of RGD-modified PGA on muscle cell differentiation. It \n\nwas shown that uncrosslinked films exhibiting RGD were the most appropriate to induce the \n\ndifferentiation of myoblasts, while crosslinked films \u2013 with and without RGD \u2013 inhibited it and exhibited \n\nan excessive cell confluence that led to detachment. \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n59 \n\nAiming to use multilayer coatings in living organisms, Picart et al. [163] tested the performance of \n\nCHI/HA coatings \u2013 either crosslinked with a carbodiimide or uncrosslinked \u2013 in vitro and in vivo. By \n\nusing a QCM and fluorimetry, degradation of the films in situ was followed upon their contact with an \n\nenzyme solution containing lysozyme, chitosanase and hyaluronidase. The in vivo degradation was \n\nstudied by implanting both types of films in mouse peritoneal cavity for 1 week. In both cases, \n\ncrosslinked films were more resistant to degradation in comparison to native films, which showed \n\nalmost complete degradation by the end of the studies. \n\nThe use of LbL-based substrates for cell expansion is an ever-evolving field. In contrast to the case of \n\nimplantable devices, which consist on the improvement of already existing devices, the reviewed works \n\npushed forward toward new ways of improving cell adhesion. Most of the times it involved the \n\ndevelopment of new types of substrates, such as the example of ligand-functionalized surfaces. It is \n\ndebatable whether the modification of 2D surfaces using LbL is a solution or an alternative to already \n\nexisting approaches. For the simple purpose of cell adhesion, conventional techniques such as grafting \n\nor plasma can achieve the same result, usually with much faster processing times. As will be debated \n\nin Section 2.6.1, the future innovations brought by LbL may lie in the coating of substrates with \n\nincreasingly complex geometry and the addition of bioactive or smart constituents that may further \n\nextend the functionality of 3D multilayer cell substrates. \n\n2.5.3 Multilayer reservoirs for drug loading and delivery \n\nThe technological advances in drug delivery have been driven by the need to develop systems that can \n\neffectively encapsulate, protect and deliver an active agent with specific kinetics, such as micelles, \n\nliposomes, polymersomes, and polymer particles/capsules [164-168]. Such wide availability of delivery \n\nsystems \u2013 not to mention the quantity of drugs available in the market \u2013 are proof enough that there is \n\nneed to develop drug delivery strategies capable of improving the efficacy and bioavailability of bioactive \n\nagents. \n\n2.5.3.1 Films loaded with active agents \n\nPicart and coworkers have performed several works consisting on the assembly of PEMs loaded with \n\nBMPs. First, PLL/HA films crosslinked with carbodiimide were doped with rhBMP-2 after \n\nconstruction [169]. Myoblast cells were seeded on these films and showed differentiation into \n\nosteoblasts, as evidenced by the increasing secretion of ALP. Consecutive in vitro cultures showed that \n\nrhBMP-2 retained its bioactivity for the length of 3 successive experiments. Recent works using the \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n60 \n\nsame formulation assembled onto tricalcium phosphate/hydroxyapatite (TCP/HAP) macroporous \n\ngranules [170] and titanium [171] demonstrated the osteoinductive character of the BMP-loaded \n\nmultilayers in a rat ectopic model. Furthermore, these coatings could be stored up to 1 year without \n\nsignificant loss of bioactivity. By studying the secondary structure of rhBMP-2, Gilde et al. [172] showed \n\nthat this growth factor retained its bioactivity when the films were stored in the hydrated and, to a lesser \n\nextent, in the dry state. \n\nHammond and coworkers also developed a series of multilayer formulations for the loading and release \n\nof various growth factors. They constructed a multilayer composition of polycationic poly(?-amino-\n\nesters) and noncytotoxic polyanions \u2013 heparin sulfate and chondroitin sulfate \u2013 intercalated with \n\nfibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2, negatively charged below pH 9.6) [173]. Assembling more layers \n\nequaled to more FGF-2 loaded and also a faster release. The bioactivity of the growth factor was \n\nretained, as revealed by in vitro biological assays. Using films built with distinct constituents, the \n\nreleased FGF-2 promoted the proliferation of a preosteoblastic cell line up to 12 days in culture. Loading \n\nmultiple growth factors is a strategy that may help, for instance, to accelerate joint implant integration \n\nand reduce recovery time and failure rates by delivering active agents that intervene in the multiple \n\nbiological events. In another report [174], multiple growth factors \u2013 rhBMP2 and a recombinant human \n\nvascular endothelial growth factor (rhVEGF) \u2013 were loaded by adsorption into multilayers assembled in \n\nmacroporous polycaprolactone/?-tricalcium phosphate. The release of rhBMP-2 was sustained over a \n\nperiod of 2 weeks, while it took 8 days for rhVEGF to elute from the films. Using a rat ectopic bone \n\nmodel, films loaded with both growth factors were able to potentiate the formation of de novo bone, to \n\nan extent 33% higher than films loaded solely with rhBMP-2 was introduced.  \n\n2.5.3.2 Polyelectrolyte capsules with tunable permeability \n\nFrom all the 3D shapes that can be coated with LbL, the simplest is the sphere. When coated, spherical \n\nmultilayer shells surround particles that can often be dissolved to produce hollow capsules. Multilayer \n\ncapsules present several advantages that are not coupled so often in other conventional fabrication \n\ntechniques: (i) they can be prepared under mild conditions of pH and temperature, avoiding the \n\ndenaturation of sensitive species and thus allowing encapsulation in high quantities [175]; (ii) a wide \n\nvariety of drugs can be encapsulated, regardless of their water solubility [176]; (iii) they allow tuning the \n\nrelease kinetics of an encapsulated agent to the external environment simply by adding a variable \n\nnumber of layers and selecting the shell constituents [177]; and (iv) specialized functions can be \n\nattributed by using stimuli-responsive or biofunctional materials with relevant biological interest [178]. \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n61 \n\nCombining distinct ingredients in the coating provide different properties to the shell, such as controlled \n\npermeability and, if smart materials are included, stimuli-responsive behavior. Costa et al. [179] \n\nconstructed microcapsules of CHI/ELR bilayers adsorbed onto inorganic calcium carbonate sacrificial \n\nmicroparticles (around 5 \u00b5m in diameter) preloaded with BSA (Figure 2.5a).  \n\n \n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nCaCO3\ncoating with\n\nchitosan/ELR \n\nmultilayers\n(e)\n\n(d)\n\n25 \u00baC\n\n37 \u00baC\n\n \n\nFigure 2.5.

Adapted with permission from ref. [179] Copyright 2013, Elsevier. \n\n \n\nAfter the assembly, the template was dissolved by ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), resulting in \n\na hollow multilayer microcapsule encapsulating BSA. The inclusion of such a temperature responsive \n\npolypeptide was expected to provide smart-responsiveness, and so, by changing the temperature \n\nbetween 25 and 37\u00baC, the mean diameter of the microcapsules varied between 5.5 and 3.2 \u00b5m, \n\nrespectively (Figure 2.5b and Figure 2.5c). The release of BSA was also affected by temperature: the \n\nrelease of this protein was more sustained in the latter case due to the temperature response of the \n\nELRs, which in the case resulted in a permeability decrease of the multilayer shells. The influence of the \n\nnumber of layers was also studied. As expected, having more layers resulted in an added barrier to the \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n62 \n\nprotein diffusion, that is, a high number of layers reduced the shell permeability (Figure 2.5d and Figure \n\n2.5e). \n\nKainourgios et al. [180] developed PSS/PDADMAC multilayer shells using silica nanoparticles (around \n\n500 nm in diameter) as templates. Following the dissolution of the template by ammonium fluoride and \n\nhydrofluoric acid, hollow spheres were obtained. After chelation, two additional layers (PAA and \n\nmethoxy-polyethylene glycol amine) were deposited on their surface and crosslinked. Daunorubicin was \n\nloaded and released at distinct pHs, showing a high quantity release at acidic pH values (pH=4, around \n\n70%) in comparison to pH 7.4 (around 15%). The reduced release at pH 7.4 was attributed to the \n\nelectrostatic interactions between the sulfonate group of the PSS \u2013 which is negatively charged at this \n\npH value \u2013 and the amino group of the daunosamine sugar of daunorubicin, which is positively charged. \n\nThe cytotoxicity of these structures towards breast cancer cells was dose-dependent and higher for \n\nincreasing daunorubicin content. \n\nRecently, Shen et al. [181] fabricated BSA-gel capsules via a two-step procedure. First, calcium \n\ncarbonate microparticles entrapping BSA were coated with PAH/PSS bilayers, followed by removal of \n\nthe sacrificial core. Afterwards, a heat treatment at 80\u00baC converted BSA into gel. By exploiting the \n\nisoelectric point of BSA (pI=4.8), loading and releasing doxorubicin (DOX) as a model drug could be \n\ntuned. At a pH higher than 4.8, the negatively charged BSA allowed a favorable loading of the \n\npolycationic DOX and its release upon lowering the pH below 4.8. Thus, rather than exploiting the \n\npermeability of the LbL shell to load and release bioactive agents, as described by Kainourgios and \n\ncoworkers [180], they relied on the jellified interior to retain DOX. Melanoma models were created in \n\nthe lungs of mice and after injection of DOX-loaded BSA-gel capsules they were more effective in the \n\nreduction of the number of melanoma metastatic nodules than injected free DOX. \n\nIngredients other than polymers can be used to render capsules stimuli-responsive. For instance, \n\nLiu et al. [182] used an emulsification method to produce magnetic alginate microspheres with around \n\n600 nm in diameter and coated them with PAH/PSS multilayer coatings. After the assembly, the \n\nemulsified alginate was liquefied by EDTA but remained entrapped within the coatings, along with the \n\niron oxide nanoparticles. DOX (cationic) was post-loaded by diffusion from concentrated solutions to the \n\ninterior and was immobilized by electrostatic interaction with alginate (anionic), with an entrapment \n\nefficiency of about 56%. Applying a high-frequency magnetic field resulted in an increase of the internal \n\ntemperature, resulting in an increase in shell permeability and DOX release with higher kinetics. \n\nFurthermore, increasing times of exposure to the magnetic field resulted in increased released \n\nquantities. \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n63 \n\n2.5.3.3 Capsules for the intracellular delivery of encapsulated agents \n\nMultilayer microcapsules have been demonstrated to be suitable carriers for drugs and to deliver them \n\neither by conventional mechanisms of diffusion to the surrounding environment or by delivering them \n\ndirectly to the intracellular environment. The latter possibility is particularly interesting. In theory, the \n\ndelivery of an active agent directly to the cells ensures that higher drug quantities will be available at the \n\ntargeted cell or tissue. Szarpak et al. [168] constructed microcapsules using HA and either PAH or PLL. \n\nThe microcapsules were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and co-incubated for 2 hours \n\nwith mouse macrophages, being both types internalized, deformed, and excreted by lysosomes. Caruso \n\nand coworkers [167] reported that the shape of the capsules influences the internalization rate: \n\nspherical capsules were more prone to undergo cellular uptake by human cervical cancer cells than \n\ncylindrical ones. \n\nParak and coworkers [183] demonstrated the internalization of degradable dextran sulfate/poly(L-\n\narginine) and non-degradable PSS/PAH by embryonic fibroblasts for a period of 5 days. The \n\nintracellular degradability of each capsule type could be followed thanks to the encapsulation of a \n\nfluorescent compound, DQ-ovalbumin. Due to a characteristic self-quenching mechanism, this \n\ncompound exhibits a red fluorescence characterized by the close proximity of the fluorescent dyes, but \n\nit shifts to a bright green upon proteolysis. After a culture time of up to 5 days, the biodegradable \n\ncapsules exhibited a green fluorescence, while the PSS/PAH capsules were in their majority red (Figure \n\n2.6). This results showed that, although both types of microcapsules could be delivered to cells, the \n\navailability of DQ-ovalbumin was higher when encapsulated within dextran sulfate/poly(L-arginine) \n\nmicrocapsules. \n\nThe results from Parak and coworkers suggest that it is not enough to ensure that a drug is delivered to \n\ncells: after delivery, the encapsulated agent needs to be available to the cellular machinery. Moreover, \n\nwith this strategy the release of the drug is mediated by the degradation of the capsule inside the cell, \n\nmaking external control over this process not possible. In this regard, Palankar et al. [184] devised a \n\nstrategy to release an encapsulated agent on demand upon cellular uptake using infrared light. A \n\npeptide ligand of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules was encapsulated \n\nwithin PDADMAC/PSS microcapsules (around 2 ?m in diameter) doped with gold nanoparticles. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2.

Enzymatic cleavage of DQ-ovalbumin upon internalization by embryonic NIH/3T3 \n\nfibroblasts. Fluorescent cargo was encapsulated either in (a) nondegradable PSS/PAH or (b) degradable \n\ndextran sulfate/poly(L-arginine) microcapsules. Images were taken immediately after the addition of the \n\ncapsules to the culture over-time up to 120 h under confocal microscopy in different channels, green, \n\nred, and transmission, where green corresponds to cleaved DQ-ovalbumin and red corresponds to \n\nintact cargo. Adapted with permission from ref. [183] Copyright 2009, American Chemical Society. \n\n \n\nUpon internalization by monkey kidney epithelial cells and chinese hamster ovary cells, an infrared \n\nlaser was irradiated over cells individually. This caused the disruption of the microcapsules\u2019 walls due to \n\nheating release by the gold nanoparticles and consequently the release of the encapsulated peptide. \n\nMoreover, contrary to what occurs with UV light, infrared light did not result in any adverse \n\nconsequence to the cells. With this strategy, bioactive agents may be encapsulated in nondegradable \n\nmicrocapsules that protect them until their release is desired and triggered on demand. \n\nThe stability and biodistribution of electrostatic self-assembled nanoparticles for systemic administration \n\nand off-body tracing was recently addressed by Poon et al. [185] by imaging techniques. They \n\nevidenced the importance of a larger number of layers and the role of the terminating layer in terms of \n\nfunctional retention. A formulation of PLL and dextran films capped with a final layer of HA assembled \n\nonto gold nanoparticles or quantum dots showed a blood elimination half-life of 9 hours and low liver \n\naccumulation could be observed in mice. \n\nA lot of effort has been done in the context of drug delivery devices made with LbL. This approach has \n\npotential for the construction of nano- and micro-carriers that provide tunable release by varying not \n\nonly the number of layers but also external parameters, such as temperature and pH. It is even possible \n\nto exploit mechanisms of delivery directly to the intracellular environment. Judging by the reviewed \n\nworks, multilayer microcapsules can be inherently uptaken by cells without requiring specific \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n65 \n\nfunctionalization wit bioactive materials. However, the intracellular degradation kinetics should be taken \n\ninto account since capsules made of nondegradable materials may limit the bioavailability of the \n\nencapsulated agents. Much research has been carried out using DOX as a model drug. These reports \n\nrepresent a step forward the usage of LbL systems in actual in vivo applications, such as in cancer \n\ntreatments, and their low or even absent negative impact in a living organism. Given the extensive \n\nknowledge of such systems using chemotherapeutics to target cancerous cells, it is likely that cancer \n\ntreatments will be the most studied application using this class of carriers in the short term. \n\n2.5.4 Biosensors \n\nBiosensors are analytical devices that incorporate biological sensing elements. Screening metabolites \n\npresent in biological fluids and in the human body is of growing importance for medical analysis, rapid \n\ndisease diagnosis and drug discovery [186-188]. This concept has been transcribed to the LbL \n\ntechnology, mainly in the form of capsules, where metabolite-sensitive fluorophores are immobilized \n\ninside a carrier, resulting in a measurable response upon contact with a specific biological agent. Parak \n\nand coworkers [189] developed microcapsules delimited by PSS/PAH multilayers and magnetite \n\nnanoparticles that encapsulated seminaphtho-rhodafluor-1-dye (SNARF-1)-dextran conjugate as mobile \n\npH sensors. The purpose of using magnetite particles was to enable a magnetic separation of capsules \n\nduring their construction. SNARF-1 exhibits a pH-responsive fluorophore that emits green fluorescence \n\nunder acidic conditions and red under alkaline ones. Using this combination, they exploited the \n\nmechanism of cellular intracellular uptake by fibroblasts and breast cancer cells. First, due to the \n\nalkaline properties of the culture medium, the microcapsules exhibited red fluorescence. After 30 \n\nminutes of incubation, capsules internalized by lysosomal/endosomal compartments turned from red to \n\ngreen, due to the acidic pH found inside the intracellular environment. The cells retained their viability \n\nand capacity to divide and proliferate. Although two types of cells were used to study this biosensor, \n\nthere seemed to be no difference in the fluorescence response observed upon cellular uptake. In the \n\nfuture, it could be interesting to have a biosensor of this class capable of measuring physiological \n\nparameters in distinct types of cells with clear distinct signals. \n\nThis simple formulation is one of the pioneer works of LbL microcapsules that act as biosensors, \n\nnamely toward physical physiological parameters like pH. However, different approaches may allow \n\nidentifying other parameters such as biochemical signals. Pan, Zhang and Li [190] presented films \n\nmade of single-walled carbon nanotubes and CHI-dispersed tin disulfide nanoparticles assembled onto \n\nglassy carbon electrodes by electrostatic interactions. While bare electrodes did not provide a clear \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n66 \n\ndistinct electrochemical signal for individual compounds \u2013 dopamine hydrochloride and uric acid, in the \n\npresence of ascorbic acid \u2013 the multilayer coating enabled the identification of clear separate \n\nelectrochemical voltammetric signals. Thus, the assembly of the coating allowed identifying \n\nsimultaneously two distinct compounds. This strategy could be useful for the fabrication of tailored \n\nelectrodes in a rapid and simple way that allow detecting and quantifying multiple specific metabolites \n\npresent in biological fluids. \n\nYu et al. [191] presented gold substrates coated with multiple dendritic stars of opposite charge \n\nfinished with an ending layer containing negatively charged carboxyl groups. These groups could be \n\nfunctionalized with by carbodiimide and N - hydroxysuccinimide which allowed binding covalently \n\nfluorophore-amino-modified single stranded DNA via amidation. Using this strategy, it was possible to \n\ndistinguish and quantify DNA hybridization behaviors between one mismatch and complementary target \n\nDNA molecules, showing that such devices could be interesting DNA biosensor platforms. \n\nAnother approach is the use of reservoirs made by LbL that encapsulate sensing molecules. One such \n\nexample is the encapsulation of enzymes as sensing molecules. Enzymes are versatile biocatalysts \n\nwhich have a wide range of important catalytic and sensing applications [192]. Kazakova et al. [186] \n\npresented PSS/PAH microcapsules that acted as multilayer biosensors and as reservoirs of (i) glucose \n\noxidase, (ii) lactate oxidase or (iii) both enzymes. PSS was labeled with tris(4,7-diphenyl-1,10-\n\nphenanthroline)ruthenium(II) dichloride complex (Ru(dpp)) \u2013  a well-known dye used in luminescence-\n\nbased oxygen sensors \u2013 and dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR123) \u2013 a non-fluorescent molecule that yields \n\nrhodamine123 which, in the presence of peroxidase, emits green fluorescence upon oxidation by \n\nhydrogen peroxide. Oxygen-, glucose- and lactate-dependent spectrofluorimetric assays dependent on \n\nconcentration were conducted, showing reliable detection at the millimolar range in all cases. \n\nThe problem with enzymes is that they lack long-term stability and limited reusability for biosensing \n\npurposes [193,194]. We described before how Parak and coworkers [189] introduced magnetite to \n\nallow separation and harvesting during microcapsule production, but this concept could be used to \n\nretrieve and reuse enzyme-encapsulating devices until the enzymatic content is depleted. \n\nGarcia et al. [192] presented a thorough study in which they developed BSA-functionalized magnetic \n\nnanoparticles (MNPs) coated with biotin- and avidin-modified horseradish peroxidase (HRP) layers \n\n(Figure 2.7a and Figure 2.7b). The enzymatic activity of peroxidase adsorbed as a single layer was \n\ncompared to that of peroxidase in solution, revealing that the enzymatic activity was similar in both \n\ncases. However, peroxidase activity increased linearly with the number of layers, exhibiting a four-fold \n\ntotal activity upon the assembly of 5 layers in respect to the solution control (Figure 2.7c). \n\n\n\nChapter 2.

Adapted with \n\npermission from ref. [192] Copyright 2011, The Royal Society of Chemistry. \n\n \n\nThese results suggest that LbL-immobilized enzymatic molecules do not block any active site in the \n\nenzyme, since the enzymatic activity increased with the number of layers, and is therefore adequate for \n\nbiosensing activities. The authors studied this system further. They showed that these biosensors could \n\nbe retrieved by magnetic-assisted harvesting and reused up to 10 consecutive cycles without loss of \n\nenzymatic activity. Then, this system was turned into a bi-enzymatic system by the incorporation of \n\nbiotin-activated glucose oxidase (GOX) as the ending layer. Two enzymatic reactions could then be \n\nexploited for the detection of glucose. Shortly, the degradation of glucose by GOX results in gluconic \n\njavascript:popupOBO('GO:0003824','c1nr10411j')\n\n\nChapter 2.

In the presence of peroxidase, \n\nAmplex red reacted with hydrogen peroxide producing resorufin, a pink-colored product observable in \n\nthe visible spectrum. Increasing concentrations of glucose could be detected and measurable by the \n\nincreasing absorbance of pink in the retrieved samples (Figure 2.7e). This work presents potential for \n\napplications concerning the detection of glucose, namely to diagnose and follow diabetes, which \n\naccount for approximately 85% of the world market for biosensors [187]. \n\n \n\nThe use of colorimetric biosensors is particularly interesting. A patient could use it for rapid screening \n\npurposes conveniently at home without any specific operation training. Colorimetric changes could \n\nprovide a quick indication of whether a person suffers from a specific disease. In a recent highlight from \n\nMcShane and Ritter [195] the potential of colorimetric biosensors was discussed. With the advent of \n\nportable devices, such as smartphones and tablet PCs, it would be possible to install multiple \n\ndiagnostic software tools that permitted to identify and rate a response from a biosensor based on \n\ncolorimetric scales. Smart tattoos \u2013 color changing particles intended for a minimally invasive dermal \n\nimplantation \u2013 could react to the metabolites present in the interstitial fluids, resulting in measurable \n\nshifts of their optical properties. Then, an external device could read that response, give a diagnostic \n\nand even send it directly to a physician. Given the potential of LbL devices for biosensing and the \n\npresent technological advances, it is likely that this concept will grow, accompanied by a miniaturization \n\nof biosensors, commodity and ease of use. LbL will contribute to this evolution since this technique \n\nallows achieving higher levels of functionalization, customization and measurement of multiple \n\nmetabolites at once. \n\n2.5.5 Implantable structural devices with tubular shape \n\nLbL allows coating substrates with distinct geometries to obtain devices from thin coatings to \n\nmembranes and three-dimensional objects. Those could have adequate anatomic shapes that could be \n\nused to replace or regenerate tissues or organs. Particular interesting examples of such devices are \n\ntubular structures, which constitute another three-dimensional shape that can be obtained by LbL \n\nbesides spheres. \n\nOne typical approach to construct tubular structures is to coat the interior of cylindrical pores, which \n\nusually lead to the fabrication of tubes with low caliber, in the order of nanometers. Liang et al. [196] \n\nwere able to conceive hybrid polyelectrolyte/nanoparticle tubes templated on the pores of \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n69 \n\npolycarbonate membranes, each pore with around 400 nm in diameter and maximum pore length of \n\n10 ?m. The membrane was first functionalized with a PEI solution that acted as the primer layer and as \n\nsupport for the assembly of PAA and PAH layers. The membrane was then dissolved with \n\ndichloromethane, leaving intact only the coatings of the inner pores with tubular shape. To give \n\nmechanical stability to these structures, the tubes were crosslinking with high temperatures (160\u00baC) or \n\nin alternative they could be assembled with gold or cadmium telluride nanoparticles intercalated \n\nbetween bilayers. Their inclusion could play an essential role in providing mechanical reinforcement, \n\naffecting the properties of small blood vessels substitutes and the structure of cells. In both cases, \n\nhollow tubes could be formed with an outer diameter similar to the size of the pore and wall thickness \n\nranging from about 50 to 80 nm. Yang et al. [197] studied the in vitro biological properties of CHI/ALG \n\ntubes with around 400 nm of diameter and estimated wall thickness of 80 nm (thickness for 16 \n\nbilayers), fabricated using polycarbonate porous membranes. Their biodegradability in pancreatin \n\ncarried out overnight resulted in a diameter reduction to 160 nm, attributed to the CHI degradation due \n\nto lipase present in pancreatic fluids. Cellular assays using human cervical cancer cells or breast cancer \n\ncells demonstrated their low cytotoxicity. They also carried out cellular uptake experiments with each \n\ncell type, showing that after 24 h the tubes could be found inside the cells. Due to the small size of \n\nthese nanotubes, such tubular structures could be useful as drug carriers for the intracellular delivery of \n\nactive agents. \n\nAnother approach for construction tubular structures is by coating sacrificial templates with cylindrical \n\nshape to assemble multilayer coatings. Since this approach relies on the use of physical shapes, it is \n\npossible to develop tubes with larger calibers that could be useful as blood vessel substitutes. Mueller, \n\nDaehne and Fery [198] used tubular templates for the fabrication of hollow LbL tubes instead of porous \n\nmembranes. Glass fibers ranging from 5 to 10 ?m were coated with PDADMAC and PSS, after which \n\nthe fibers were dissolved by hydrogen fluoride. However, the authors warned for the possibility of \n\npearling instability, that is, the deterioration of a liquid cylinder into a series of droplets, also known as \n\nthe Rayleigh instability. This effect results from the tension of the wall surface provoked by a high ionic \n\nstrength at the time of template dissolution. To solve this issue, they added an additional layer of PAH, \n\nwhich is known to withstand high concentrations of salt. Indeed, the addition of this material eliminated \n\npearling instability, resulting in the formation of stable hollow tubes. The tubes were dried and shown to \n\nbe resistant, with a Young\u2019s modulus of around 200 MPa. Curiously, He et al. [199] took advantage of \n\nthe pearling instability to construct tubes that transform into capsules. They used the polycarbonate \n\nporous membrane template to assemble PSS/PAH multilayer tubes. Then, by increasing temperature \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n70 \n\nup to 138\u00baC, tube segments separated, closed and formed capsules. This interesting tubular-derived \n\ncapsular formation strategy can be useful for other applications, such as delivery of drugs or genes and \n\nfor the preparations of reactors or biochemical sensors [200]. \n\nIn the work of Silva et al. [201] CHI/ALG hollow tubes were developed using glass tubes (around 1 mm) \n\nas templates. Glass was first coated with a thin sacrificial layer of paraffin, which served as the \n\nsubstrate to adsorb 100 bilayers. Upon assembly, the paraffin was dissolved by dichloromethane, \n\nresulting in hollow cylindrical structures with a caliber comparable to the template (Figure 2.8a). \n\nAfterwards, some tubes were crosslinked by genipin (Figure 2.8b) which provided structures with \n\nstorage and Young\u2019s moduli about twice the uncrosslinked tubes when immersed in PBS (Figure 2.8c), \n\nan important property for implantable devices. In vitro biological studies up to 7 days using a fibroblast-\n\nlike cell line demonstrated that the cells adhered preferentially to crosslinked films, showing a more \n\nelongated and spread morphology (Figure 2.8d) in comparison to native films. \n\n \n\n(a)\n\nCrosslink\n\nb\n\n(c)\n\nd\n\n \n\nFigure 2.8.

Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n71 \n\nThe synthesis of hollow tubular structures has the potential to mimic the structure of blood vessels. The \n\ntuned permeability of the multilayered walls potentiates the control of gas and nutrient exchanges from \n\nand into circulating fluids. They could help in cases of coronary artery and peripheral vascular diseases, \n\nwhich are still a cause of high mortality in western societies. Usually, autologous vessel grafts are the \n\nstandard treatment when small diameter vessels are involved. However, to many patients this option is \n\nlimited due to the lack of suitable vessels or because of a previous harvest [202,203]. Moreover, their \n\nlarge surface area makes them appealing for other applications such as catalysis, sensing or tissue \n\ngrowth supports [204-206]. \n\nTubular LbL structures still remain a largely unexplored area. A possible reason for this is the difficulty \n\nassociated with their fabrication: collapsing of the internal wall and pearling instability, which are \n\nphenomena not encountered for simpler structures, such as the 2D films and 3D spheres and scaffolds. \n\nMost of these studies also focus on the morphological, mechanical and in vitro biological \n\ncharacterization, but, to our knowledge, attempts of cellular colonization of multilayer tubes\u2019 interior has \n\nyet to be attempted. Indeed, LbL tubular structures may be envisaged as blood vessels, but one must \n\nbe aware that blood vessels \u2013 artery, vein, capillary \u2013 have different calibers, with capillaries being \n\nsuggested to have a mean diameter of 5 ?m [207]. \n\nThe possibility of LbL to control the constituents with each adsorbing layer may be used to mimic the \n\nstructure of blood vessels, which is organized in three layers: intima, media and adventitia. In each \n\nlayer, distinct percentages of collagen and elastin are found to supply the arterial wall matrix with \n\nstrength and elasticity [203,208]. Furthermore, besides the conventional approaches of sacrificial \n\ntemplates coated with PEMs described herein, tubular multilayer structures may be produced with new \n\nstrategies that disregard the dissolution of templates and may even incorporate natural constituents of \n\nblood vessels. In respect to the latter, as we will be discussed in Section 2.6.2, Akashi and coworkers \n\nhave been exploring hybrid multilayers containing cells and ECM components to fabricate tissue \n\nanalogues in vitro, including analogues of blood vessels. \n\n2.5.6 Compartmentalized environments \n\nWith the successful extrapolation of LbL to 3D, multilayer films have started to be perceived not as \n\ncoatings but as boundaries that delimit and confine an internal environment. One can find such analogy \n\nin Nature in the elegant example of cells. Cells are unique for their hierarchical and compartmentalized \n\norganization. Delimited by the phospholipidic membrane, the cytoplasm provides a balanced \n\nintracellular environment where the organelles are maintained and execute various specialized functions \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n72 \n\nsuch as the transport of numerous compounds, synthesis of proteins and regulation of enzymatic \n\nreactions. Thus, besides compartmentalization, cells also exhibit multifunctionality thanks to the \n\nspecialized structures confined within [209-211]. \n\nAlthough cells may seem a complex inspiration to follow, some strategies have already been proposed \n\nto mimic their structure using multi-shelled organic and inorganic capsules prepared by template-\n\nassisted strategies [212-214]. However, as they are often accompanied by harsh processing conditions, \n\ncompartmentalized assemblies of polymeric multilayer nano/microcapsules within larger partitions have \n\nbeen achieved by using non-aggressive bottom-up strategies [215], among them LbL [216,217]. In a \n\nsimplistic structural organization, cells can be transcribed to a compartmental model, where a large \n\ncompartment confines a liquefied environment in which subcompartments are suspended. Each \n\ncompartment exhibits a distinct function and is delimited by its own membrane. In any case, \n\nmultilayered or not, compartmentalization has allowed combining properties and confining reactions \n\nthat could not be achieved simply with single-component assemblies [218]. \n\n2.5.6.1 Confined enzymatic reactions \n\nThe concept of multilayered multicompartments was first demonstrated by Sukhorukov and \n\ncoworkers [219] who developed concentric shell-in-shell nanostructured microcapsules. They used \n\ncalcium carbonate microparticles produced by co-precipitation of calcium chloride and sodium \n\ncarbonate, during which fluorescent-tagged human serum albumin (HSA) and magnetite nanoparticles \n\nwere entrapped. As observed in Figure 2.9a, the microparticles were coated with PSS/PAH multilayers \n\nand, instead of dissolving this sacrificial template afterwards, they submitted the coated particles to a \n\nsecond coprecipitation stage. At this stage, HSA tagged with another fluorophore was also present. This \n\nway, a second calcium carbonate inorganic layer was assembled around the first one while entrapping \n\nHSA separated from the underlying core by the PSS/PAH multilayers. In this formulation, the magnetite \n\nwas used for magnetic separation and harvesting of ball-in-ball structures. After chelation of both \n\ninorganic sections, fluorescence microscopy confirmed the presence of a shell-in-shell structure, each of \n\nthem containing HSA tagged with the distinct fluorophores (Figure 2.9b). Following the same procedure, \n\nthe authors used this concept to encapsulate also GOX in the outer compartment and peroxidase in the \n\ninner compartment. Upon the addition of glucose to the surrounding medium, the enzymatic reaction \n\ncould be detected by the Amplex Red fluorescence in the inner compartment due to the formation of \n\nresorufin (Figure 2.9c). This is a similar situation to that reported previously by Garcia et al. [192] in \n\nsingle-compartment capsules, where an identical enzymatic reaction was identified by the visible optical \n\n\n\nChapter 2.

Reprinted with permission from ref. \n\n[219] Copyright 2007, Wiley-VCH. \n\n  \n\nOther complex structures can be obtained through similar approaches. Instead of concentric \n\ncompartments, Tong et al. [220] produced PAH/PSS coatings around calcium carbonate microparticles \n\npre-doped with polystyrene-block-poly(acrylic acid) (PS-b-PAA) micelles. After chelation with EDTA, it was \n\npossible to observe the free micelles (around 30 nm) suspended inside the PEM microcapsules (around \n\n3 ?m). In contrast to Sukhorukov and coworkers [219], in this work not just one \u201cball\u201d was \n\nencapsulated inside a larger one. Instead, several smaller containers were suspended within the larger \n\nmultilayer compartment. They also demonstrated the loading capability of water soluble and water \n\ninsoluble drugs. Namely, the hydrophobic triclosan was encapsulated in the micelles\u2019 cores and the \n\nwater soluble DOX in the microcapsule\u2019s interior by association with the negatively charged PAA corona \n\nof the micelles. This strategy has clear potential for the simultaneous delivery of hydrophobic and \n\nhydrophilic drugs. \n\nHosta-Rigau et al. [221] constructed LbL-based capsosomes \u2013 polymer capsules containing liposomal \n\nsubcompartments \u2013 as carriers of therapeutic molecules. Silica microparticles (around 3 ?m) were \n\ncoated with a precursor PLL layer followed by the adsorption of liposomes containing thiocoraline (TC), \n\na hydrophobic antitumoral drug. Two liposome layers were assembled, each separated by a PEM of PLL \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n74 \n\nand poly-(methacrylic acid)-co-(cholesteryl methacrylate) (PMAc) and this structure was then protected \n\nby adding additional polymer layers to hold the liposomes in place. In comparison to the other \n\ndescribed works, this approach was developed to show compartmentalization organization at an \n\ninterfacial level, rather than in the interior of the microcapsules. Incubation with colon cancer cells \n\nshowed an increased anti-carcinogenic activity of capsosomes containing TC-loaded liposomes, when \n\ncompared to capsosomes without TC. In the presence of the former, cells exhibited a reduction of \n\nviability as high as 43%. \n\n2.5.6.2 Customizable environments with multifunctional components \n\nCompartmental devices are useful in fields such as catalysis, sensors, multiple drug delivery, disease \n\nmodels, energy storage and microreactors,  which often require complex phenomena to occur \n\nsimultaneously [34,222,223]. In particular, this technology permits adding materials that respond to \n\nexternal stimuli either in the composition of the coatings or in the interior of three dimensional \n\nstructures. This opportunity opens chances for customization of compartmentalized devices rather than \n\nbeing limited to the confinement of enzymatic reactions and drug encapsulation. Costa et al. [224] used \n\na hybrid ionic gelation strategy assisted by LbL to fabricate temperature and magnetic responsive \n\ncompartmentalized capsules with hierarchical organization from the nano- to the macro scales. First, \n\nCHI/ELR multilayers coated calcium carbonate microparticles (3 ?m) entrapping superparamagnetic \n\nnanoparticles (MNPs, 10 nm). Afterwards, they were encapsulated within ALG beads (2 mm) by ionic \n\ngelation, which were further coated with CHI/ALG films. EDTA was then used to chelate the calcium \n\ncarbonate that served as template for the microcapsules and liquefy the jellified ALG. The result was a \n\nmultilayer-confined liquefied alginate environment encapsulating smaller microscopic compartments \n\nwith both temperature and magnetic responsive materials. Each of the capsular compartments was \n\nloaded with rhodamine. Release studies at 25 and 37\u00baC showed that the rhodamine release was more \n\nsustained at physiological temperature (71%, in comparison to 84% at room temperature), being this \n\nbehavior in accordance with the previous work of the same group with BSA-loaded microcapsules [179]. \n\nMNPs, which were confined within the microcompartments, were shown to attribute magnetic \n\nresponsiveness towards external magnetic fields to the whole compartmentalized device, allowing their \n\nspatial mobilization and immobilization. One could think that a millimetric device delimited with a \n\nnanometric coating would be unable to withstand the stress of carrying a cargo. The authors, however, \n\nalso showed that the millicapsules were capable of withstand centrifugal stress and handling without \n\nrupturing the LbL external membrane. This is a useful and convenient property, which makes it easy to \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n75 \n\ntransport and transfer these devices between different containers if necessary (e.g., well-plates, Petri \n\ndishes). This class of customizable hierarchical systems can be envisaged to control the release of \n\nseveral biomolecules simultaneously, their spatial immobilization in targeted therapies and the control \n\nover a multitude of cellular in controllable reactors. The authors studied the two stimuli in separate and \n\ndid not explore the mixed influence of temperature and magnetic response in the release of \n\nencapsulated molecules. Nonetheless, it may be possible to explore their combined effect for amplified \n\nhyperthermia treatments such as those found in cancer treatments [225] and studying its effectiveness \n\nin killing cancer cells inside such a millimetric model reactor for drug discovery and screening. \n\nCompartmentalized systems inspired on cells are still in an early infancy but their future potential as \n\ndrug delivery and enzymatic reactors has already been proved. The potential of such devices may allow \n\nfor this technology to advance in terms of functionality and customization by coupling functionality that \n\nis not found together in Nature. In Section 2.6.3, we will show that mammalian cells may be \n\nencapsulated and form microtissues inside such liquefied capsules that could be explored in tissue \n\nengineering applications. \n\n2.6 Engineering tissues in vitro \n\nPresently, when a patient\u2019s organ fails the only treatment available is transplantation. However, organ \n\navailability for transplantation is limited and in many cases the waiting leads to the patient\u2019s death. As a \n\nresponse, tissue engineering has appeared as a multidisciplinary field that applies principles of biology, \n\nchemistry, physics and engineering, culminating in life and health sciences [226]. The ultimate \n\nobjective of this field is not only to help biological structures to regenerate for themselves but also to \n\nproduce tissues and organs in lab that could serve as functional substitutes for damaged tissues and \n\norgans. For that purpose, it is typical for tissue engineering strategies to combine cells, scaffolds that \n\nprovide a three-dimensional environment and biochemical signals, such as growth factors. \n\n2.6.1 Three-dimensional porous structures \n\nLbL can be used to coat substrates with complex and convoluted geometries other than simple planar \n\nsurfaces. Three-dimensional substrates may be coated and eventually provide a porous structure to be \n\npopulated by cells for the development of alternative cell growth platforms for tissue engineering \n\napplications. This feature is particularly important when considering the development of environments \n\nresembling the spatial arrangement of cells in native tissues and organs as much as possible. \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n76 \n\nIt is possible to construct convoluted three-dimensional structures made exclusively with LbL \n\nconstituents with porosity for cell seeding. For example, Sher, Cust\u00f3dio and Mano [227] developed \n\nporous scaffolds using leachable PEI-functionalized paraffin wax particles as template. Aggregates of \n\nparaffin wax particles were packed together and coated with CHI/ALG films using a perfusion-assisted \n\nLbL strategy. Afterwards, the particles were dissolved by dichloromethane, leaving only the PEM \n\nstructure with porosity and interconnectivity. They served as substrates to seed human osteoblast-like \n\ncells, which adhered and proliferated within 7 days. Following an identical approach to produce \n\nscaffolds, Silva et al. [228] developed 3D structures of CHI and chondroitin sulfate multilayers for \n\nbovine chondrocytes and multipotent bone marrow derived stromal cells. Both types of cells were able \n\nto proliferate significantly and retain their viability for as long as 35 days. Histology on scaffolds seeded \n\nwith bovine chondrocytes showed that the number of cells per section increased with the time of culture \n\nand started to show a more homogeneous dispersion after 14 days of culture. Lacunae formation was \n\nalso observed in the matrix surrounding these cells, indicating the maintenance of the chondrogenic \n\nphenotype. Similar results were obtained for scaffolds seeded with the stromal cells, accompanied by \n\nthe deposition of glucosaminoglycans (GAGs), an indicator of chondrogenic differentiation. \n\nInstead of a 3D template, it is possible to modify pre-existing structures with LbL to improve the \n\nbiological performance upon contact with the cells. Ye et al. [229]  used a decellularized porcine aortic \n\nvalve that acted as support for heparin and CHI multilayers (Figure 2.10a). In comparison to uncoated \n\nmatrices, they exhibited lower platelet adhesion and activation, lower adhesion of leukocytes and \n\nsignificantly higher whole-blood clotting time (Figure 2.10b and Figure 2.10c). Human blood derived \n\nendothelial progenitor cells were seeded into the coated matrix for 5 days and showed almost full \n\ncoverage of the available surface with a well-spread morphology and maintenance of the endothelial \n\nphenotype (Figure 2.10d). Therefore, a matrix with anti-thrombotic properties and good repopulation \n\ncapability by endothelial cells was obtained and it constitutes a viable alternative to current valve \n\ntransplantation alternatives. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2.

[230] presented a strategy in which the formation of fibrillar structures is \n\nwas induced across the pores\u2019 walls of diamine-modified poly(?-caprolactone) scaffolds. Using a \n\ncustom-made dipping robot, the pores were coated with ALG/CHI multilayers from solutions with \n\ndifferent concentrations (0.5\u20135 mg?mL\n-1\n\n) and rinsing times (5\u201340 minutes). After the assembly, the \n\nscaffolds were frozen at -80\u00baC, which led to the formation of ice crystals that caused localized \n\ncompression, shear and stretching on the assembled layers. Consequently, the coating would \n\nexperience displacement from the walls toward the center of the pores, resulting in fibrillar structures of \n\nALG/CHI multilayers. High rinsing times inhibited the formation of such structures: a lengthy washing \n\nstep did not allow excess polyelectrolyte solution to remain inside the pores which would lead to the \n\nformation of complexes and fibrillar structures. Moreover, the use of the most concentrated solutions \n\nled to an increase in the formation fibrillar structures and more uniformly spread than with more diluted \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n78 \n\nsolutions. With these structures, it could be possible to increase the surface available area for cell \n\ngrowth. In fact, using osteoblast-like cells, they demonstrated that cells adhered and proliferated \n\npreferentially in scaffolds containing fibrils that resulted from shorter rinsing times and concentrated \n\npolyelectrolyte solutions. \n\n2.6.2 Cells as components in the LbL construction \n\nAkashi and coworkers have followed an elegant LbL-based approach to develop hybrid polymeric and \n\ncellular constructs capable of providing a three-dimensional environment and simulate the hierarchical \n\norganization of tissues. In an early report [231], they started by seeding a monolayer of fibroblasts on a \n\nfibronectin-functionalized cover glass, followed by the adsorption of seven fibronectin and GEL bilayers. \n\nFibronectin is a well-known ECM glycoprotein related to the adhesion, migration and differentiation of \n\ncells. They are also known to interact with materials of the collagen class, like GEL, which was exploited \n\nto drive the LbL assembly between these two materials. The preparation of this multilayer was expected \n\nto provide an interface similar to the natural ECM to seed a second layer of cells. Following this pattern, \n\nthey were able to construct 4 cell layers intercalated by fibronectin/GEL bilayers with controlled \n\nthickness (around 6 nm). More recently, using a similar multilayer construct, they intercalated human \n\nprimary dermal fibroblasts and umbilical vascular endothelial cells to evaluate their stability and \n\nfunction, including after a heat shock of 45\u00baC [232]. They observed that the layered structure provided \n\na protective and biologically suitable environment for the cells in comparison to the ones seeded in \n\nculture dishes. Using a similar approach, Kim and Rajagopalan [233] focused on hepatic-related \n\napplications by seeding a rat hepatocyte monolayer over a collagen gel-coated substrate, followed by a \n\ncoating of CHI/HA multilayers. Afterwards, a layer of rat liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (rLSECs) was \n\nadded. The CHI/HA served as an analogue of the Space of Disse, a separator between the endothelium \n\nand the epithelium which helps in the diffusion of nutrients to the hepatocytes. Its role helps \n\nmaintaining the hepatic functions of the liver cells and their differentiation state. It was expected that \n\nsuch construct would provide hepatocytes with a hepatic three-dimensional adequate environment that \n\nwould prevent their dedifferentiation. Thus, in comparison to a cultured monolayer of rLSECs, rLSEC-\n\nPEM-hepatocyte cultures maintained their differentiated state over 12 days, whereas in the former case, \n\nrLSECs lost their phenotype within 3 days. \n\nThe use of ECM components and cells opens the way for LbL to be used in the fabrication of tissues in \n\nvitro by allowing cells to be stratified in a 3D environment. Akashi and coworkers have been very active \n\nin the development of devices that could help achieve such a three-dimensional cell organization for \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n79 \n\ntransplantable constructs or angiogenesis models. Recently [234], they presented layered \n\npolyelectrolyte/cell structures as blood vessel analogues. To achieve this purpose, hydrogels of ?-PGA \n\ncontaining spatially arranged silica tubes (up to 620 ?m in diameter) were used. The tubes were \n\nremoved afterwards, thereby resulting in a gel containing uniaxial pores with inner diameter of around \n\n700 ?m. Fibronectin/GEL films were then assembled by perfusion, followed by a suspension of human \n\numbilical artery smooth muscle cells, another polymeric film, and finally human umbilical vein \n\nendothelial cells. With these two types of cells, the typical composition of blood capillaries and the \n\nintima and media layers \u2013 containing endothelial and smooth muscle cells, respectively \u2013 could be \n\nmimicked. The permeability of this capillary analog was assessed by following the perfusion of BSA \n\nfrom the capillary lumen to the hydrogel template. The coating of the microchannels was able to act as \n\na barrier to the diffusion of this high molecular weight protein (around 66 kDa) with a diffusion rate \n\nconstant about 7 times inferior to uncoated microchannels. In contrast with the conventional approach \n\nof tubular constructs involving sacrificial templates, this work did not take such an approach. Instead, \n\nthey demonstrated that LbL can be used to construct blood vessel analogues within three-dimensional \n\nporous hydrogel networks. This way, it may be possible to develop a three-dimensional device with \n\nenhanced perfusion of nutrients, oxygen and also delivery of bioactive molecules to cells confined within \n\nthe gel. \n\nAnother strategy to construct 3D multilayer structures consists in the rapid cell-accumulation technique. \n\nThis approach consists in the assembly of ECM components directly at the surface of cells and the \n\nconsequent cell self-organization into layers. For this purpose, Akashi and coworkers [235] assembled \n\nfibronectin and GEL layers (with an estimated total thickness of 6 nm) onto the membrane of various \n\ntypes of cells (Figure 2.11a). Coated mouse fibroblast cells were able to organize themselves into 8 \n\ndense and homogeneous layers (around 35 ?m), in comparison to a tattered and porous structure \n\nobtained using noncoated cells. The authors justified that since fibronectin/GEL films assembled on \n\nindividual cell surfaces provide an interactive property with the ?5?1 integrin receptor of the cell \n\nmembrane, the cell-cell adhesion of all seeded cells in three-dimensions can be induced at the same \n\ntime. Their study proceeded with an attempt to produce 3D cell structures with in which endothelial \n\ntube networks could be formed. The cell accumulation technique allows \u201csandwich\u201d structures \n\ncontaining different cell types to be made. A cellular construct consisting of 8 layers of human dermal \n\nfibroblast cells divided by 1 intermediate layer of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was \n\nconstructed in a controlled manner by adjusting the number of cells that were incubated simultaneously \n\n(Figure 2.11b). After 7 days of incubation, a highly-developed capillary networks and a tubular \n\n\n\nChapter 2.

This technology may be adapted to produce analogues for other kinds \n\nof tissues with interest in tissue engineering, such as the pancreas and heart. \n\n2.6.3 Production of microtissues in confined environments \n\nIn tissue engineering, the use of alginate as templates for the fabrication of millimetric capsules permits \n\nthe incorporation of cells for the formation of microtissues, drug discovery, and to conduct fundamental \n\nstudies using complex cellular microenvironments.

However, it is known that often cells require \n\nanchorage points that allow them to attach, spread and proliferate, otherwise risking cellular \n\ndeath [238]. To increase available surface area inside the capsules, plasma-functionalized poly(L-lactic \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n82 \n\nacid) (PLLA) microparticles were co-encapsulated in the ALG medium along with fibroblasts, which \n\nensured that cells survived up to 28 days. In principle, such devices could be adapted to include more \n\ncomplex features such as microparticles, they could be able to deliver bioactive agents inside the \n\ncapsules or the combination of multiple cellular populations. \n\n2.7 Conclusions \n\nThe multitude of multilayer devices developed so far show how LbL-based strategies have surpassed \n\nthe simple purpose of modifying surfaces. It is clear that LbL permits achieving high degrees of \n\nfunctionalization and complexity, both in bioactivity and geometry, for various biomedical applications. \n\nWe summarized the factors that influence the construction of PEMs, with pH and ionic strength being \n\nthe factors most often manipulated to improve the assembly output. Also, we described the efforts \n\nmade to minimize the lengthy construction times that are necessary to obtain not only thicker films but \n\nfilms in sheer quantity, an important feature when envisaging future mass production of multilayered \n\nbiomedical devices. \n\nEmphasis was given to discussing an exhaustive list of potential biomedical applications that may \n\nbenefit from LbL-based approaches. Implantable devices, such as coated prosthesis cells, may have \n\nfacilitated biointegration in a living organism. Surfaces may be modified to exhibit \u201cspecial\u201d properties \n\nthat result in improved mechanical properties, or with stimuli-responsiveness that may help tuning the \n\nadhesion of cells or tissues to PEMs. Moreover, being LbL a versatile technique, convoluted three-\n\ndimensional PEM arrangements can be obtained throughout all dimensional scales: 0D (nanoparticles \n\nand fibers), 1D (nanotubes), 2D (thin coatings and membranes) and 3D (tubes, capsules, scaffolds). \n\nFree-standing membranes may act as wound healing dressings, porous scaffolds as novel cell \n\nexpansion supports for tissue engineering, and tubular structures as analogues for blood vessels. Also, \n\nthe use of cells as multilayer constituents may allow building hybrid constructs that resemble tissues \n\nboth in function and structure. From all 3D devices explored, spherical capsules have been by far the \n\nmost studied. They offer possibilities of drug delivery and biosensing either by diffusion or by targeting \n\ncells, while degradation and cargo release/reactivity can be finely controlled by a variety of mechanisms. \n\nFinally, structures mimicking natural structures, such as that of biological cells, can be constructed in \n\nthe form of compartmentalized structures exhibiting organization at distinct size scales. Although \n\ngenerally limited to confining enzymatic reactions, they may be customized and act as multifunctional \n\nmicroreactors to simulate specific events, such as disease models and microtissue production. It is \n\nexpected that LbL will continue to contribute to technological advancements in the biomedical field. \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies \n\n \n\n83 \n\nBoth in conventional medicine and in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, the possibilities \n\nopened by LbL will allow developing devices with superior performance when compared to the \n\ntechnology currently in use. \n\n2.8 References \n\nReferences \n\n[1] Boudou T., Crouzier T., Ren K., Blin G., and Picart C., Multiple Functionalities of Polyelectrolyte \n\nMultilayer Films: New Biomedical Applications, Advanced Materials 2010, 22: 441-467. \n\n[2] Elbert D.

Elastin-like macromolecules\n3\n \n\n3.1 General introduction \n\nScientists have long discovered that macromolecules are the best option for obtaining highly functional \n\nand complex materials. Hierarchical organization, self-assembly, or \u201cintelligence\u201d are common to many \n\nnatural macromolecules and desirable for several applications in biology and biotechnology. Proteins, \n\nnucleic acids, and polysaccharides are fine examples of structures that have been employed in many \n\nbiomimetic concepts displaying such properties. \n\nIn biomedicine, several advances have been made in the last decades regarding the design and \n\nconception of new state-of-the-art devices with great potential for future in-depth studies and, ultimately, \n\nuse in human healthcare services. Some of them emerged from the increasing use of elastin-derived \n\nmaterials, consisting in viable and functional protein-based molecules as alternatives to the conventional \n\npolymers used in biomedical applications, including in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine \n\n(TERM). \n\nElastin-like macromolecules are genetically engineered materials rooted in the repeating sequence of \n\nnatural elastin, a vital protein component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) found in various mammalian \n\ntissues [1]. As biomaterials, they became popular for exhibiting excellent mechanical properties [2-6] \n\nand biocompatibility [7-10]. They have also shown potential to self-assemble and respond to changes of \n\nthe environment or under physiological conditions [11-14]. \n\nBecause of their genetic-engineered origin, they are often called elastin-like polymers or, more recently, \n\nelastin-like recombinamers [15]. This class of materials can be modified to virtually include any desired \n\npeptide sequence, especially functional sequences with relevant biological role [16-18], and has already \n\nbeen studied extensively for applications in drug delivery [19-21], and cell and tissue engineering [22-\n\n24]. In the following sections, a comprehensive discussion of the importance of elastin-like \n\nmacromolecules in the conception of TERM devices will be presented. Here, not only their properties \n\nwill be presented but also their origin and natural inspiration. \n\n                                                 \n3\n This chapter is based on the following publication: \n\nCosta R.

More recently, \n\nbiological or natural materials, found in animals and plants, were added as a fifth direction. Natural \n\nmaterials are intricate structures which have risen from hundreds of millions of years of evolution. \n\nComparing to our current technology, Nature was able to conceive structures more complex than \n\nman-made materials, forming complex arrays, hierarchical structures and multi-functionality [26,27]. \n\nAccording to Wegst and Ashby [28], natural materials can be categorized into four groups: (i) ceramics \n\nand ceramic composites \u2013 shells, bones or any material where the mineral component is prevalent; (ii) \n\npolymer and polymer composites \u2013 e.g. ligaments and silk; (iii) elastomers \u2013 elastic soft tissues in the \n\nbody which undergo large stretches or strains; and (iv) cellular materials \u2013 typically light-weight \n\nmaterials prevalent for example in feathers, wood and cancellous bone. \n\nUpon implantation, natural-based biomaterials can be recognized by the body and process it through \n\nestablished metabolic pathways [29,30]. The metabolic products end up being simple sugars, amino \n\nacids or minerals. This eliminates the possibility of cytotoxic and inflammatory response from the host, \n\na situation occurring with wear particles of long-term orthopedic joint prostheses made of metal or \n\nsynthetic polymers [31]. In this regard, inspiration was found in Nature to develop new materials and \n\nnew methods of processing. In particular, the scientific community has been exploiting biological \n\nsystems to produce tailored materials. Such synergy between the idealized material and its final \n\nconstruction is the basis of Biomimetism [32,33]. This principle has already started to be applied \n\nthrough genetic engineering, through the construction of specific deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) \n\nsequences in order to obtain a desired peptide [34]. Elastin-like macromolecules are one successful \n\nexample of this methodology, mimicking natural elastin, which will be discussed in the following \n\nsections. \n\n3.3 Elastin as a source of inspiration for nature-inspired polymers \n\nElastin is a vital biopolymer with elastic properties. It can be found in the structures that require \n\nelasticity as part of their function, stretching and relaxing more than a billion times during life [1]. For \n\ninstance, the content of elastin in skin is 5\u201310%, in ligaments is 10\u201315% and in the aorta it is as high \n\nas 40\u201350% [35]. \n\n\n\nChapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules \n\n \n\n105 \n\n3.3.1 Genetic coding \n\nThe elastin gene is a single copy gene found in chromosome 7 in humans [36]. Tropoelastin is the \n\nproduct of this gene and the precursor of human elastin. It is a 72 kDa soluble precursor with 760 \n\nresidues [37,38], and is expressed by various cell types during the pre- and neonatal stages of \n\ndevelopment, including smooth muscle [39] and endothelial cells [40], fibroblasts [41] and \n\nchondrocytes [42]. Currently, the full amino acid composition of tropoelastin is known for several \n\nspecies besides humans, like rats and bovines. Although some variations exist, there is still a similarity \n\nof 70% among the different tropoelastin species [36,43-46]. \n\nThe elastin gene possesses 36 exons, encoding two major alternating domains: hydrophobic \n\n(responsible for elasticity) and hydrophilic crosslinking domains. The composition of the hydrophobic \n\ndomains is a combination of glycine (G), valine (V), proline (P), alanine (A), leucine (L) and isoleucine (I) \n\nresidues \u2013 being the first two the most abundant \u2013 often repeated in sequences of (GVGVP), (GVPGV) \n\nand (GVGVAP). The hydrophilic domains contain several lysine (K) and A residues, which show an \n\nimportant role in the crosslinking of tropoelastin.[1,36,47] \n\nIn order to synthesize the mature elastin, the precursor must undergo a process called elastogenesis \n\n(Figure 3.1), a highly complex phenomenon comprising all the events that lead to the synthesis of a \n\nfully functional elastic fiber [48]. The process starts with the synthesis of tropoelastin itself, in the rough \n\nendoplasmic reticulum. As soon as they are formed, a galactolectin \u2013 an elastin-binding protein \u2013 acts \n\nas a chaperone that prevents premature intracellular aggregation [48]. This association lasts until the \n\ncomplex is excreted into the extracellular medium. The binding protein has a higher affinity for \n\ngalactosugars of the microfibrilar component of the extracellular medium. Outside the cells, the \n\nmicrofibrils act as scaffolds for the deposition and alignment of tropoelastin molecules, which end up \n\ncross-linked to each other in K-containing sites [49,50]. Crosslinking is the culmination of elastogenesis, \n\nresulting in mature elastin, which is insoluble but extremely stable. In fact, it is one of the most stable \n\nproteins known and has a half-life of from 40 to 70 years [51,52]. \n\n\n\nChapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules \n\n \n\n106 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1. The elastogenesis phenomenon, starting by the translation of the elastin gene and \n\nproceeding to its alignment by microfibrils. \n\n3.3.2 Characteristics of elastin \n\nMature elastin is an insoluble polymer composed by several or more tropoelastin molecules covalently \n\nbound to each other by crosslinks. Despite its essential hydrophobic nature, elastin can be highly \n\nhydrated by water molecules from both hydration and solvent water. In between the very rigid \n\ncrosslinking domains, the hydrophobic segments exhibit a considerable mobility [36,53]. \n\nDespite several decades of research, elastin\u2019s own nature has hindered the study of its properties and \n\nstructure, mostly due to the insolubility in water and backbone mobility. Nevertheless, scientists were \n\nable to obtain important knowledge regarding this polymer. For example, calorimetric studies have \n\nshown that entropy is the primary source of its remarkable elasticity and swelling capability in vivo [54-\n\n56]. \n\nThere are two main models that attempt to explain elastin\u2019s behavior: the single-phase model (also \n\nknown as random-chain model) and the two-phase model. The latter can be further divided into the \n\nliquid-drop and the oiled-coil models. The single-phase model considers elastin to be like a typical \n\nrubber with randomly distributed polymeric chains in any solvent system [55,57]. The two-phase \n\n\n\nChapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules \n\n \n\n107 \n\nmodels state that water-swollen elastin is composed of hydrophobic domains between cross-linked \n\nproteins and the aqueous solvent is driven to the spaces between its domains. Specifcally, the liquid-\n\ndrop model [58] assumes that the peptide segments between the crosslinks are globular domains. The \n\noiled-coil model [59] is similar to the liquid-drop model, but assumes that the so called \u201coiled-coils\u201d are \n\nbroader in comparison and composed of a series of ?-turns between the crosslinking domains. \n\nUnfortunately, none of the models described provide sufficient insight regarding the molecular basis for \n\nits elastomeric properties at atomic level. The groups of Urry and Tamburro carried out a variety of \n\nphysical-chemical studies using synthetic elastin-based pentapeptides to investigate the relationship \n\nbetween its structure and function [4,56,60,61]. Their studies led to the conception of yet another two-\n\nphase perspective: the ?-spiral or fibrillar model, stating that there is one type II ?-turn per pentameric \n\nunit, stabilized by intra-spiral, inter-turn, and inter-spiral hydrophobic contacts. The repetition of this \n\nconformational unit results in an organized helical arrangement called the ?-spiral, hence the name of \n\nthe model. \n\n3.3.3 Elastin disorders \n\nMutations involving elastic fibers are important for understanding the function of elastin and the process \n\nof elastogenesis and associated disorders. Congenital supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) is a \n\npathological condition associated with a mutation in the elastin gene. The symptom is the obstruction of \n\nthe outflow from the left ventricle narrowing of the arterial lumen, due to a failure to regulate cellular \n\nproliferation and matrix deposition of elastin [62-64]. At the molecular level, the cause is a lack of some \n\ncrosslinking domains or deficient coacervation of tropoelastin molecules [62,65]. SVAS can be inherited \n\nas an autosomal dominant trait or as part of the Williams\u2019 syndrome, a developmental disorder \n\ninvolving the central nervous system and the connective tissues [66]. Another pathology linked to the \n\nelastin gene is cutis laxa, a rare autosomal dominant disease caused by abnormally branched and \n\nfragmented elastic fibers with reduced tropoelastin deposition in the elastic fibers and few microfibrills \n\nin the dermis. The symptoms are inelastic loose-hanging skin, hernias, and emphysema [67,68]. \n\nChanges in other molecules found in elastic fibers may also result in deficient elastogenesis or \n\nabnormal structures. Marfan\u2019s syndrome, for example, is an autosomal dominant disorder associated \n\nwith mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1, characterized by pleiotropic manifestations in the ocular, \n\nskeletal, and cardiovascular systems [69]. \n\n\n\nChapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules \n\n \n\n108 \n\n3.3.4 Current applications of elastin as biomaterials \n\nElastin can be used as a biomaterial in different forms. It can be found in its insoluble form in purified \n\nelastin preparations, or it can be hydrolyzed to obtain soluble elastin ones. One problem associated with \n\nelastin use in biomedical devices is calcification because it serves as a nucleation site for mineralization, \n\na problem to be considered especially in cardiovascular implants. Fortunately, it can be controlled by \n\nusing molecules that prevent calcification, like ethanol/ ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) \n\ntreatments or the addition of glycosaminoglycans or basic fibroblast growth factor [70-72]. \n\nNaturally, elastin can be found also in autografts, allografts, xenografts and decellularized ECM\u2019s. Well-\n\nknown examples are split-skin autografts for burn wounds, autologous saphenous veins and umbilical \n\nvein allografts for coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and aortic heart valve xenografts. Incorporation \n\nof elastin in biomaterials is especially significant when its elasticity or biological effects can be exploited. \n\n3.3.4.1 Skin \n\nSkin is the largest organ of the human body. It is composed by two layers: epidermis and the dermis, \n\nwhich lay on subcutaneous fat. The epidermis consists mainly of layers of keratinocytes scattered with \n\nother cell types, among them melanocytes and Langerhans cells. It is separated from the dermis by the \n\nbasement membrane. The dermis is comprised of papillary and reticular compartments which contain \n\nan ECM made of collagen, reticulum fibers, elastin, and glycosaminoglycans. The cellular constituents \n\nare mainly fibroblasts [73,74]. \n\nSkin substitutes are usually applied to treat either burn or chronic wounds. There are several \n\ncommercial solutions currently available, like Apligraf\n\u00ae\n, among others [75]. Apligraf\n\n\u00ae\n is a type I collagen \n\ngel cultured with human neonatal foreskin dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes, and has been used for \n\nthe treatment of venous leg [76] and diabetic foot ulcers [77]. Like others, it contains little elastin, so \n\nautologous skin grafting is still the gold standard for skin substitutes. Other solutions have still been \n\ninvestigated. Hafemann et al. [78] developed a membrane of collagen and elastin of porcine origin to \n\nserve as a matrix for neo-dermis growth with acceptable morphology and function. Using rats as animal \n\nmodels, these membranes showed complete vascularization and colonization with fibroblasts and cells \n\nfrom the immune systems within three weeks. \n\nMore recently, Nillesen et al. [79] designed an acellular double-layered skin construct, both cross-linked, \n\nto improve wound regeneration. The epidermal layer was essentially made of collagen containing \n\nheparin and a fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 7 to stimulate the proliferation of keratinocytes. The dermal \n\n\n\nChapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules \n\n \n\n109 \n\nlayer was porous and consisted of type I collagen fibrils, solubilized elastin from equine ligamentum \n\nnuchae, dermatan sulfate, heparin, FGF-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Using a rat \n\nmodel, and in comparison to another commercial skin substitute, Integra\n\u00ae\nDRT, the double-layered \n\nconstruct showed more cell influx, significantly less contraction and increased blood vessel formation at \n\nearly time points. As late as 112 days, it also contained the most elastic fibers and hair follicle- and \n\nsebaceous gland-like structures could be identified. This work addressed a current problem of wound \n\nclosure, which requires minimal contraction, vascularization, and elastogenesis in the early stages. \n\n3.3.4.2  Vascular constructs \n\nType I collagen and elastin are the main components present in the arterial wall matrix supplying the \n\nartery with strength and elasticity, respectively. Blood vessels are structured in three layers: intima, \n\nmedia and adventitia. In the typical three-layered architecture, elastin is found in the intimal and medial \n\nlayers. Collagen is also found in the media and adventitia sites [80,81]. \n\nCoronary artery and peripheral vascular diseases cause high mortality in western societies. The \n\nconventional treatment is surgery to restore blood flow using autologous vessels or valves [80,82]. \n\nAlthough autologous vessels remain the standard for small diameter grafts, many patients do not have \n\na vessel suitable for grafting because of vascular disease, amputation, or previous harvest. Artificial \n\ngrafts made from expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (ePTFE) or Invista Dacron\n\u00ae\n are an alternative \n\noption [83,84], but for smaller vessels (diameter less than 5 mm) the possible formation of clots from \n\nthrombotic events may rapidly close them. In the past two decades, tissue-engineered solutions have \n\nemerged, using elastin as a crucial ingredient. Stitzel et al. [85] have developed vascular graft scaffolds \n\nfabricated by electrospinning using polymer blends of type I collagen from calf skin, elastin from bovine \n\nneck ligament, and poly (D,L-lactide-co -glycolide) (PLGA). The scaffolds were tested both in vitro and in \n\nvivo, using a mice model, and showed an absence of elicit local and systemic toxic effects. They also \n\npossessed a tissue composition and mechanical properties similar to that of native vessels. Koens et \n\nal. [80] developed a triple layered construct consisting of an inner layer of elastin fibers, a middle \n\n(porous) film layer of collagen fibrils and an outer scaffold layer, also made of collagen. The substitute \n\ndid not evoke platelet aggregation in vitro. The structure could also be sutured and was considered \n\nadequate for in vivo application. \n\n\n\nChapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules \n\n \n\n110 \n\n3.4 Nature-inspired biosynthetic elastins \n\nTypically, aggressive methods of extraction are used to isolate elastin from tissues. Those can comprise \n\nthe use of 0.1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at 98\u00baC, or autoclaving [86,87]. More recent approaches \n\nfollow stepwise protocols under mild conditions by peptide-bond cleavage [88]. However, the yield of \n\nthese approaches is usually low. Based on the exploitation of biological systems, one was developed \n\nthat helps addressing this problem by the production of tailored molecules mimicking natural elastin \n\nthrough genetic engineering. The pentapeptide poly(VPGVG) was the first to be extensively studied, for \n\nbeing the most abundant sequence in natural elastin, but variations of this model soon followed. It was \n\npossible to produce recombinant peptides with precision over the primary amino acid content, being \n\nable to introduce relevant functional sequences, for example to improve cell adhesion, trigger \n\nbiomineralization and vascularization.  Due to their characteristics and peptide sequence, these \n\nmolecules are known as elastin-like recombinamers (ELRs), a recombinant class of elastin-like polymers \n\n(ELPs) [15]. \n\n3.4.1 General properties of elastin-like recombinamers \n\nELRs are a promising class of biocompatible protein-based polymers inspired in the mammalian elastin \n\nprotein sequences, or modifications thereof [4,34,89]. In aqueous solution and below a certain \n\ntransition temperature (Tt), the free polymer chains are disordered, consisting in fully hydrated random \n\ncoils, mainly by hydrophobic hydration. This kind of hydration is characterized by ordered clathrate-like \n\nwater structures surrounding the nonpolar moieties of the polymer with a structure somewhat similar to \n\nthat described for crystalline gas hydrates, although a more heterogeneous one that varies in terms of \n\nperfection and stability [4,13]. When the temperature is increased above Tt, the structure loses the \n\nwater molecules from hydrophobic hydration and the chains fold and assemble. A phase-separated \n\nstate is formed, consisting of 63% water and 37% polymer, in weight. In this self-assembled separated \n\nstate, the chains adopt a regular non-random structure known as ?-spiral conformation [60,61,90]. \n\nUrry studied this phenomenon and stated that a polypeptide with a correct balance of polar and \n\nnonpolar amino acids can be soluble in water at low temperatures, yet undergoing a phase separation \n\nfrom the aqueous medium upon raising temperature [91]. In the latter case, the structures assemble \n\ninto anisotropic fibers due to hydrophobic associations between the ?-spirals. This folding is completely \n\nreversible if the temperature of the sample is decreased again below Tt [4,34]. This transition \n\nphenomenon is called inverse temperature transition (ITT) and has become the key issue in the \n\n\n\nChapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules \n\n \n\n111 \n\ndevelopment of new peptide-based polymers as molecular machines and materials [92]. Although the \n\nphenomenology of ELRs is similar to that of amphiphilic polymers with a lower critical solution \n\ntemperature (LCST), the presence of an ordered state above the Tt led to the usage of the term \u201cinverse \n\ntemperature transition\u201d as a descriptive term for these polymers\u2019 behavior [92,93]. \n\nThe self-assembly of ELRs is also dependent on others factors and external stimuli besides temperature. \n\nThere is a strong dependence of the Tt on concentration in the range of 0.01 to 5\u201310 mg.mL\n-1\n\n, \n\nshowing a decrease in Tt with increasing macromolecule concentration, due to the facilitated \n\naggregation of molecules in higher number [13,34]. Above this range, the Tt does not show further \n\nsignificant changes with increasing concentrations up to 150\u2013200 mg.mL\n-1\n\n [13,94]. Increasing the \n\nionic strength of an ELR solution also influences the Tt and is particularly useful to trigger the ITT \n\nphenomenon when its concentration is low. Reguera et al. [95] suggested that an increase in the salt \n\nconcentration increases the polarity of the solvent. This creates a higher difference in polarity with \n\nrespect to the hydrophobic moieties of the polymer, recruiting more and more ordered water molecules \n\nto surround the polymer chains. Increasing the molecular weight of the ELR has also been \n\ndemonstrated to decrease the Tt [96,97]. ELRs can be modified in order to exhibit smart behavior \n\ntowards other stimuli. By modifying the composition of the polymer it is possible to conceive materials \n\nthat react to stimuli like pH, redox reactions and even light [90,98,99]. \n\nSome ELR systems have been developed, being successful in maintaining some of the main \n\ncharacteristics of natural elastin. For example, the cross-linked matrices of these polymers retain most \n\nof the mechanical properties of elastin [100,101], which becomes important when this behavior is \n\naccompanied by other interesting properties, such as biocompatibility, stimuli-responsive behavior, and \n\nthe ability to self-assemble. \n\n3.4.2 The principle of genetic engineering \u2013 a powerful tool for engineering \n\nmaterials \n\nIn the last decade protein biosynthesis showed the ability to directly produce high molecular weight \n\npolypeptides of exact amino acid sequence with high fidelity. Its usefulness to biosynthesize ELRs \n\nproceeds with near-absolute control of their macromolecular architecture in size, composition, \n\nsequence, topology, and stereochemistry [102,103]. There are a few limitations, however, in respect to \n\nthe sequence and its final properties. In the general model (VPGXG), X does not support \n\nproline.[15,104] Substitution of amino acids in other positions is also limited. For example, \n\n\n\nChapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules \n\n \n\n112 \n\npoly(APGVG) becomes an irreversible granular precipitate instead of a reversible viscoelastic coacervate \n\nupon increasing the temperature [105]. \n\nRecombinant DNA technology and bacterial protein expression have been employed for the biosynthesis \n\nof repetitive polypeptides based on the 20 naturally occurring amino acids with no direct parallels in \n\nNature [91,102,106]. It is a technology that clearly opens infinite possibilities, with far more potential \n\nthan most common synthetic ways of production, limited only by the living molecular machinery itself. \n\nUrry has presented five essential axioms to conceive protein-based macromolecules capable of \n\nundergoing hydrophobic folding and assembly due to inverse temperature transitions, presented in \n\nFigure 3.2. Shortly, the axioms describe that the ITT depends on an ELR aminoacid composition and \n\nthat external factors can also influence its conformation and Tt. \n\n \n\nThe manner in which a guest aminoacid, alters the transition temperature, Tt, of a \n\nhydrophobic folding and/or assembly transition is a functional measure of its\n\nhydrophobicity.\n\nRaising the temperature above Tt results in hydrophobic folding and assembly and\n\ncan be used to perform useful mechanical work \u2013 thermomechanical transduction.\n\nAt a constant temperature, lowering the Tt to below an operating temperature, by\n\ndecreasing its hydrophobicity, also results in hydrophobic folding and assembly.\n\nTemperature, pressure, chemical concentrations, charged state of functional side\n\nchains, redox states and light-elicited changes in the structure can be used to alter Tt. \n\nDistinct functional groups sensitive to any of the above mentioned factors can be\n\ncoupled by being part of the same hydrophobic folding and assembly domain.\n\nAll the mentioned energy conversions can be demonstrated to be more efficient\n\nwhen carried out using more hydrophobic protein-based polymers.\n\nAxiom 1\n\nAxiom 2\n\nAxiom 3\n\nAxiom 4\n\nAxiom 5\n\n \n\nFigure 3.2. The five axioms of elastin-like recombinamers, according to Urry [10]. \n\n \n\nTypically, ELRs are produced by Escherichia coli strains through bacteria fermentation, accounting for \n\nnearly 80% of the cell\u2019s volume by the end of the process within cytoplasmatic inclusion bodies. It can \n\nachieve low production costs by producing an elastin sequence via the machinery of living cells, \n\nindependently of its complexity. The production cost of those materials is not related to their complexity \n\nsince the most costly task in terms of both time and money is the gene construction. However, once the \n\nplasmid is inserted in the microorganism genetic information, the fast and cheap production of the \n\npolymer rapidly compensates for the costs associated with the molecular biology steps. This intrinsic \n\nadvantage also has environmental benefits, since recombinant protein-based materials are obtained by \n\n\n\nChapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules \n\n \n\n113 \n\nan easily scalable technology fermentation that uses only moderate amounts of energy and \n\ntemperatures, with water as the only solvent [15,91,107,108]. \n\n3.4.3 From genetic construction to molecules with tailored bio-functionality \n\nThe design of an appropriate strategy at the gene level is critical for the efficient synthesis of the protein \n\nencoding sequence and to produce a uniform protein product with an optimal quality and yield. The \n\nbiosynthesis of any artificial protein generally includes: (i) design and construction of a coding synthetic \n\ngene for the protein of interest in a plasmid with close transcription control; (ii) the cloning of a \n\nrecombinant gene with the necessary transcriptional regulatory elements into competent host cells; (iii) \n\nthe screening of plasmids containing the desired clones and verification of their DNA sequence; (iv) \n\ntransformation of the chosen plasmids into expression-competent host cells; (v) the growth of \n\nappropriate volumes of host cells and induction of protein expression; and (vi) purification of the protein \n\nof interest from cell lysates [109]. \n\nMolecular biology techniques are typically employed to self-ligate monomer DNA fragments in an \n\noligomerization process that relies on restriction-enzyme-based approaches when designing genes that \n\nencode repetitive recombinamers. In this case, the monomeric fragments must be oligomerized in a \n\n\u201chead-to-tail\u201d orientation and can either be seamless in sequence or contain intervening linkers between \n\nthe desired repeats. Approaches to oligomerization can be classified as: (i) iterative, where a DNA \n\nsegment is oligomerized in a series of single, uniform steps. Each step extends the oligomer by one unit \n\nof length of the monomer gene; (ii) random method or \u201cconcatemerization\u201d, where an uncontrolled \n\nnumber of monomer DNA segments are oligomerized in a single step to create a population of \n\noligomerized clones with different lengths. This method creates a library of genes of different lengths \n\nthat encode oligomeric polypeptides with the same repeat sequences but sacrifices the precision of the \n\noligomerization process; finally, (iii) recursive directional ligation (RDL), an alternative method in which \n\nDNA segments with two different restriction sites flanking the insert are joined in sequential steps, with \n\nthe length of the ligated segments growing geometrically in each step. This approach is suitable for the \n\nsynthesis of repetitive polypeptides with a specific and predetermined chain length as it seamlessly \n\njoins the two monomeric inserts and also eliminates the restriction sites placed at either end of the \n\ndimerized gene [110]. \n\nAn obvious disadvantage of oligomerization would seem to be the incapability to generate biopolymers \n\nwith unnatural aminoacids, such as those not encoded by conventional codons or ones containing \n\n\n\nChapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules \n\n \n\n114 \n\nchemical modifications, cyclic aminoacids, aromatic amino acids or ?-amino acids, amongst others. \n\nFortunately, this problem can be resolved by native chemical ligation [111,112]. Recently, Liu et \n\nal. [113]  have developed a new approach that allows incorporating unnatural amino acids to be \n\ngenetically encoded in mammalian cells.  \n\nOne of the main goals in the materials field is to develop materials with an increasing and \n\nprogrammable degree of complexity which is closely related with the application. More complex \n\nmaterials are capable to perform more complex and tailored functions (Figure 3.3). \n\n \n\nTissue Engineering\n\nDrug and Gene-Delivery\n\nSurface Engineering\n\nHybrid Materials\n\nFusion Protein Purification\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nd)\n\nc)\n\n \n\nFigure 3.3.

Recombination techniques allow obtaining several degrees of complex: the \n\nschematic represents (a) a simple model of recombinant elastin; (b) the introduction of specific peptide \n\nsequences and blocks with distinct properties; (c) the inclusion of a bioactive motif or; (d) the inclusion \n\nof more than one in the same peptidic formulation. \n\n \n\nThe primary sequence of ELRs is responsible for the formation of well-defined secondary structures, \n\nsuch as ?-helices, ?-sheets or ?-turns, assembling into supramolecular structures. Furthermore, they \n\ncan be switched by several factors, such as temperature, pH and light in aqueous solution and can \n\ninclude crosslinking or self-assembling domains and diverse bio-functionalities along the polypeptide \n\nchain. Those may include targeting ligands, cell adhesion or specific biodegradation sequences, \n\nfluorescent or contrast agents. Combined with their good expected biocompatibility and favorable \n\ndegradation rate and products, they constitute promising materials for multiple applications, with \n\nparticular emphasis in biomedical and nanotechnological applications [114,115]. \n\n\n\nChapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules \n\n \n\n115 \n\n3.4.4 Biocompatibility of ELRs \n\nThe biocompatibility feature of ELRs, which is relevant for their use in advanced biomedical applications, \n\nwas evaluated by the complete series of the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) generic \n\nbiological tests for materials and devices in contact with tissues, tissue fluids and blood [101,116,117]. \n\nRegarding these biopolymers, it has not been possible to obtain monoclonal antibodies against them; it \n\nwould seem that the immune system cannot distinguish them from the natural elastin. In a more \n\ndetailed interpretation of this effect, Urry et al. [118] have suggested that the ?-spiral strongly \n\ncontributes to prevent the identification of these foreign materials by the immune system. Additionally, \n\nthe secondary products of its biodegradation are just simple and natural amino acids that can be \n\nmetabolized by the body to produce non-toxic degradation products. More detailed examples of their \n\nbiocompatibility and multifunctional possibilities will be discussed in the next section. \n\n3.5 ELRs as advanced materials for biomedical applications \n\nELRs have found widespread use due to their good biocompatibility and non-immunogenicity in the \n\nfields of drug delivery and tissue engineering. As they can be genetically synthesized, the precisely-\n\ndefined molecular weight is ideal for drug delivery, because the molecular weight is a key parameter in \n\nthe route of clearance from the body and in vivo half-life of the polymer [104]. The ability to display \n\nstimuli-driven variations in their structure as consequence of their self-assembling behavior in aqueous \n\nsolution has been exploited into useful functional structures and devices combining these properties, \n\nwith an adequate arrangement of specific building blocks and physicochemical and mechanical \n\nproperties. \n\n3.5.1 Tissue engineering \n\nNew classes of materials with additional tissue-specific properties or ones which could be tailored to \n\nseveral tissue systems are required for TERM. The ECM is an important model for the design of \n\nbiomaterials. The goal of mimicking the ECM structure and biological functions requires the design of \n\nartificial scaffolds that reproduce one or, preferably, more properties and functionalities of the natural \n\ntissue [119,120]. The scaffold must be biocompatible and biodegradable and it should own properties \n\nthat support tissue morphogenesis. This generally requires a multifunctional artificial ECM that can \n\nsupply temporary mechanical support until the engineered tissue has sufficient mechanical integrity to \n\n\n\nChapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules \n\n \n\n116 \n\nsupport itself. Future advances in tissue engineering will depend on the development of biomimetic \n\nmaterials that actively participate in the formation of new functional tissues [27]. \n\nRecombinant DNA technologies allow designing and expressing artificial genes to prepare artificial \n\nanalogues of ECM proteins with controlled mechanical properties that incorporate domains to modulate \n\ncell behavior. Crosslinked ELRs of poly(VPGVG) resulted in a matrix showing a mechanical response \n\nsimilar to the natural elastin [116], which is an important factor to provide a structural basis that \n\nproperly transmits the forces from the environment to the growing tissue. However, these cross-linked \n\nmatrices showed anti-fouling properties limiting cell adhesion. Although lacking bio-functionality that \n\nwould promote unspecific cell adhesion, the poly(VPGVG) concept matrix was used as starting material \n\nwith good mechanical and biocompatible properties, and short peptides having specific bioactivities \n\nwere inserted into the polymer chain, even though by chemical synthesis. Once genetic engineering \n\ntechniques became the production method of choice, the molecular design started to increase in \n\ncomplexity. To increase the complexity of ELRs, a simple substitution of the amino acid X in the elastin \n\nrepeated unit (VPGXG) results in the addition of cross-linking domains to obtain more stable substrates, \n\nwhich are usually based on lysine residues [2,121-123]. \n\nSeveral modular ELRs have been designed to include bioactive peptides into the polymer chain such as \n\nthe well-known, general purpose cell-adhesion sequence RGD [124], found in several ECM proteins \n\n[18,125-127], and arginine-(glutamic acid)-(aspartic acid)-valine (REDV) [128], included in the CS5 \n\ndomain of fibronectin and specific for endothelial cells [17,129]. An extra feature \u2013 namely degradation \n\nresponsiveness \u2013 has been included into more advanced versions of ELRs for tissue repair to allow the \n\nrenovation and replacement of natural ECM by living tissue [17,130]. In this regard, ELR-hydrogels have \n\nbeen obtained by different cross-linking methods such as photo-initiation [131], irradiation [132], or \n\nenzymatic cross-linking [121]. The physical properties can be tuned by the cross-linking conditions and \n\ndegree, while retaining the stimuli-responsive behavior. This way, appropriate bioactive substrates can \n\nbe obtained for a wide range of applications. Highly porous hydrogels have been conceived by chemical \n\ncross-linking of ELRs containing REDV sequence: a salt leaching/gas foaming was performed to obtain \n\nsuitable 3D scaffolds promoting infiltration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) inside \n\nthe porous network (Figure 3.4) [133]. \n\n\n\nChapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules \n\n \n\n117 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4. Microscopy assessment of HUVECs seeded in macroporous ELP hydrogels after 48 h of \n\nincubation in: (a) fluorescence microscopy with phalloidin Alexa Fluor488 and 4',6-diamidino-2-\n\nphenylindole (DAPI) staining; and (b) SEM magnified view.

Copyright 2009 American Chemical Society. \n\n \n\nAnother potential application of these bioactive ELRs is the preparation of films to be used for ocular \n\nsurface tissue engineering [134,135]. Recently, Srivastava et al. [135] have successfully investigated \n\nthe use of ELRs as a substrate to maintain the growth, phenotype, and functional characteristics of \n\nretinal pigment epithelial cells in vitro to obtain a suitable carrier for transplantation in the treatment of \n\nage-related macular degeneration. \n\nHybrid scaffolds composed of collagen and different proportions of this ELR-REDV have been obtained \n\nby enzymatic cross-linking by tissue transglutaminase, affecting physical properties such as porosity, \n\nthermal behavior and mechanical strength. Such approach led to a differential colonization of the \n\nscaffolds with diverse cell lines, which is very useful for vascular-tissue and skin-wound healing [121]. \n\nOther complex hybrid scaffolds were created to obtain an acellular arterial substitute as artificial vessel-\n\nlike platforms: they were produced by the combination of several layers of an ELR matrix reinforced with \n\ncollagen microfibers, resulting in constructs with appropriate mechanical properties, such as \n\ncompliance or suture retention strength [136]. Other types of smart bilayer scaffolds of an ELR \n\ncontaining RGD and collagen have also been investigated \u2013 foams, fibers and foam-fiber bilayer \n\nscaffolds [137]. The study of the structural and mechanical properties indicated that the incorporation \n\nof ELRs into the scaffold improved the uniformity of the pore network and decreased the fiber diameter. \n\nThe culture of human fibroblasts and epithelial cells in these scaffolds showed the positive contribution \n\nof the bioactive ELR on the proliferation of both cell types, compared to a collagen foam. These results \n\nwere promising for the reconstruction of full-thickness skin and oral mucosa equivalents. \n\n\n\nChapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules \n\n \n\n118 \n\nOther strategies consist in the incorporation of ELR coatings onto different materials to improve cell \n\nattachment or stimuli-responsiveness. Barbosa et al. [138] developed chemically cross-linked chitosan \n\nhydrogels with an ELR coating containing an osteoconductive sequence inducing precipitation of \n\ncalcium phosphate when the gels were soaked in simulated body fluid. More recently, an ELR \n\nincorporating octaglutamic acid with well-defined charged backbone has been used to design \n\nmultifunctional bone cements resulting in materials with hydroxyapatite binding ability and improved \n\nmechanical strength [139]. Prieto et al. [140] have designed a set of ELRs containing the SNA15 \n\nstatherin analog domain. In vitro mineralization showed interesting results in the effect of the ELR \n\ncomposition as a key parameter to control the calcium phosphate nucleation. These studies show the \n\nhigh potential of ELRs for biomedical hybrid materials development. \n\nAnother attractive alternative is based in the thermal behavior of modular amphiphilic ELRs to form in \n\nsitu stable gels under physiological conditions [141,142]. They constitute low viscosity solutions below \n\ntheir Tt and form physically cross-linked hydrogels by self-assembling that are suitable for fixing \n\nmaterials and biological elements in specific sites in the body through minimally invasive procedures. \n\nWhen greater mechanical integrity is desired, the mechanical properties can be enhanced by including \n\nadditional chemical crosslinking domains in the ELR chain [117,143]. Sallach et al. [144] have also \n\nhighlighted the good biocompatibility of these ELR physical gels showing a minimal inflammatory \n\nresponse and robust in vivo stability for periods exceeding 1 year. These self-gelating materials offer the \n\npossibility to obtain multifunctional bioactive versions, which can be also used as carriers for controlled \n\ndrug release or as biocompatible surface coatings. Oliveira et al. [145] used an ELR containing the RGD \n\ncell adhesion domain to fabricate cell-induced microparticle aggregates as scaffolds for TERM. Using a \n\nSaOs-2 osteoblast-like cell line and microparticles with varying degrees of crosslinking, they have shown \n\nthat for higher degrees of crosslinking the cell proliferation was more favorable and formed cell-induced \n\naggregation scaffold. \n\n3.5.2 Drug- and gene- delivery \n\nDrug delivery carriers have several advantages over free drug delivery systems such as specific site \n\ntargeting, sustained release, minimized systemic exposure and reduced toxicity. In order to be effective, \n\nsystemic drug delivery carriers must be biocompatible and have controllable composition and molecular \n\nweight. Although a wide range of materials have been employed for controlled and targeted drug \n\nrelease, the most common carriers are polymeric-based systems [146,147]. \n\n\n\nChapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules \n\n \n\n119 \n\nELRs exhibit several properties that can be useful for drug delivery purposes, such as precise control \n\nover molecular weight and composition, self-assembly and stimuli-responsive behavior, as well as \n\nbiocompatibility, non-toxic properties and efficient pharmacokinetics. In addition, their genetic nature \n\nallows incorporating targeting ligands, cell membrane fusion sequences or reactive sites for drugs \n\nconjugation [21,148,149]. Their self-assembly can also be designed in response to an extrinsic \n\ntemperature stimulus, such as the local application of heat, ultrasound or light, or intrinsic to the site \n\nenvironment, such as low extracellular pH or up-regulated protease expression for cancer drug \n\ndelivery [150]. \n\nThe ability of ELRs to form stable micro- and nano-particles that are able to trap active substances has \n\nfacilitated the development of smart systems for therapeutic release. Poly(VPAVG) was shown to form \n\nstable particles in water solution with a size below 3 \u00b5m above its Tt. They exhibited hysteresis behavior \n\nand were capable of encapsulating significant amounts dexamethasone phosphate with a sustained \n\nrelease profile for about 30 days.[151] Later, two bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP-2 and BMP-14) \n\nwere encapsulated for combined release in a sustained way for 14 days, promising for bone tissue \n\nengineering [19]. Electrospraying has been used by Wu et al. [152] to generate stimuli-responsive ELR \n\nnanoparticles (300\u2013400 nm in diameter) that can encapsulate drugs. The molecular weight and \n\nsolution concentration of the ELRs were found to have a significant influence on the morphology and \n\nsize distribution of the nanoparticles. Doxorubicin, a cancer chemotherapeutic agent, was released by \n\nthe ITT-driven solubility of the particles at 37\u00baC. In other recent report, Dash et al. [153] have fabricated \n\ntunable monodispersed cross-linked ELR hollow spheres ranging from 100 nm to 1000 nm by using a \n\ntemplate-based method. Plasmid DNA and polyplexes were efficiently loaded inside hollow spheres by \n\ndiffusion and charge interactions. These polyplex-loaded spheres displayed controlled release and \n\ntransfection ability in their use as gene transfection agents, with the possibility to include future \n\nfunctionalities to the spheres for targeted gene delivery applications. \n\nSome of the recent studies are more focused on controlling the size and monodispersity of ELR \n\nparticles, since these are two key factors in improving therapeutic efficacy. Genetic engineering of \n\nprotein-based block copolymers is a suitable way to program defined polypeptide block sequences to \n\nstudy the influence of macromolecular architecture in the hierarchical structural organization and \n\nmorphology. ELR-based amphiphilic block copolymers undergo ordered nanoscale self-assembly \n\nforming protein-like micellar systems with controlled structure and function. Strategies that describe \n\nstable monodispersed ELR particles include those of Chilkoti and co-workers [150,154,155] who \n\nfabricated sub-100 nm sized micelles conjugated to diverse hydrophobic molecules and \n\n\n\nChapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules \n\n \n\n120 \n\nchemotherapeutics. The goal of these studies was to investigate the design rules for tuning the self-\n\nassembly of different ELRs forming multivalent spherical micelles within the clinically relevant \n\nhyperthermic temperature range 37 to 42\u00baC and target cancer cells. Similarly, Kim et al. [156] \n\nimproved the stability of micelles from ELR-diblock copolymers incorporating cysteine residues at the \n\ncore-shell interface, which undergo covalent cross-linking through disulfide bond formation. Most of \n\nthese studies involve diblocks, although there are some examples based on triblocks, such as one that \n\nrelies upon a reversible switch of secondary structures [157]. The triblock-ELR copolymer can form \n\nmonodispersed temperature-responsive micelles in dilute solutions below its Tt and an abrupt increase \n\nin the micelle compacticity with a reduction in particle size occurs upon raising the temperature. \n\n3.5.3  Surface engineering \n\nIn the field of biomaterials science the control and modification of surfaces and interfaces has opened \n\nnovel frontiers for developing advanced materials and devices with distinct and specific features for \n\nbiomedical applications [158,159]. Surfaces can be functionalized by multiple approaches involving \n\nphysical or chemical modifications, such as coatings and grafts. They allow introducing small biological \n\nligands, like peptides or proteins with fouling/anti-fouling features, specific groups for cell-material \n\ninteractions, smart behavior (stimuli responsive or environmentally sensitive), or micro- and nano-\n\npatterns [160-162]. \n\nSurfaces modified with stimuli-responsive polymers, called \u201csmart surfaces\u201d, undergo physical and \n\nchemical changes in response to external variations [163-165]. In this regard, ELRs exhibit some \n\nadditional advantages that make them excellent candidates for the development of smart surfaces: their \n\nstimuli-responsive behavior can depend on other factors such as pH, light, or ionic strength, amongst \n\nothers. Genetic engineering also allows for a precise control of the reactive sites on the polypeptide \n\nchain for use in surface grafting, leading to an extensive potential of the self-assembly exhibited by \n\nthese polymers. Biosensing surfaces displaying topologically modified self-assembly with ELRs have \n\nbeen developed by Chilkoti\u2019s group. The \u201cthermodynamically reversible addressing of proteins\u201d (TRAP) \n\ntechnology obtained by covalent micro-patterning of ELRs onto glass surfaces against an inert \n\nbackground allows a reversible, spatio-temporal modulation of ligand-binding triggered by the phase \n\ntransition of the ELR at a solid-liquid interface. Such technology can be applied in different systems for \n\nbio-analytical sensors in order to detect single biomolecules [159,164]. Fluorophore-labeled glutamine \n\nbinding proteins (QBPs) and derivatives - which can be coupled to a designed hydrophobic polypeptide - \n\ncan be constructed and adhered onto solid surfaces [166]. Another novel fusion protein for controlling \n\n\n\nChapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules \n\n \n\n121 \n\ncellular functions combines the RGD sequence, epidermal growth factor (EFG), and a hydrophobic \n\nsequence into a single molecule: it was shown to exhibit both cell-adhesive and growth-factor activity. In \n\naddition, the hydrophobic sequence contributed to self-assembly of the RGD, retaining its activity on a \n\nsolid-phase surface and proving its use for wound healing [167]. \n\nFor tissue engineering, novel temperature-responsive culture surfaces coated with ELR has been \n\ndeveloped for cell harvesting. By reducing the temperature using a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) \n\nmembrane, the cell sheet was detached from the coated surface and subsequently transferred to new \n\nsurfaces, suggesting its potential for the fabrication of multilayer cell sheets for transplantation.[24] For \n\nbone tissue engineering, an ELR-RGD has been adsorbed onto micro-patterned poly(N -isopropyl \n\nacrylamide) films displaying a positive maintaining of the cell attachment in the scaffolds under dynamic \n\nculture conditions [168]. Na et al. [169] have also developed a lysine-containing ELR conjugated onto \n\naldehyde-glass surface by micro-patterning. The sharp and controllable phase transition of ELR enabled \n\nreversible cell adhesion on the surface by changing the temperature or salt concentration, \n\ndemonstrating potential applications for cell-based micro-devices. \n\nOther techniques using ELRs include the alternating adsorption of polyelectrolytes. This is a simple \n\ntechnique for generating bioactive surfaces, driven by complementary forces occurring between two \n\ndistinct materials [170]. These ultra-thin nanoscale coatings promote cell adhesion and proliferation \n\nand the results show that the thickness and mechanical integrity of the multilayer assembly modulates \n\nthe cell response. Swierczewska et al. [170] have reported the use of ELRs \u2013 modified either with \n\npoly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) or poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) to provide positive or negative charge, respectively \u2013 \n\nto conceive films in a sequential fashion. Another similar work described a similar approach but with \n\nELRs containing negatively charged residues [171]. Costa et al. also reported the construction of thin \n\ncoatings [172] and nanostructured multilayers [173] made of chitosan and RGD-containing ELRs with \n\nsmart properties towards temperature and pH (Figure 3.5) and also improved cell adhesion. These \n\nexamples opened up a field where polymeric coatings include specific biofunctional responses. \n\nProgress in the last few years combining surface chemistry with microfabrication techniques has \n\nprovided new tools to study cell-material interactions with their environment. Using lithography and \n\npatterning techniques, peptides and proteins can be deposited with absolute spatial control on specific \n\nregions of a surface [174,175]. \n\n\n\nChapter 3.

Copyright 2011 Wiley-VCH. \n\n \n\nThe ability to obtain nano- and micro-structured surfaces of patterned biomacromolecules is of great \n\nimportance for several applications, including biological assays, miniaturized biosensors, and \n\nbiomedical diagnostics. In this regard, ELRs have been employed in the design and development of \n\nbiosensors and microfluidic bioanalytical devices, as reported by Nath and Chilkoti [176]. \n\nNanostructured surfaces taking advantage of the self-assembly properties of ELRs have been obtained \n\nfor capturing and releasing proteins by combining ELRs and dip-pen nanolithography. \n\nRecently, the replica molding method has been adapted to obtain 3D micro-structured thermo-\n\nresponsive ELR hydrogels by Mart\u00edn et al. [123]. In this study, the thermally responsive behavior of \n\nmacroscopic and micro-patterned features with different dimensions and spacing was studied, showing \n\ndimensional changes with no alteration of the topography. This feature could be used during cell culture \n\nadjusting the Tt in the correct range to study cell behavior by changing the dimensions of the micro-\n\npattern and subsequent mechanical properties. \n\n3.6 Conclusions \n\nElastin is the root of inspiration for a class of versatile materials with physical and biological properties \n\nof great interest for TERM applications. The cumulative studies of elastin and elastin-like \n\nmacromolecules now provide the required background for understanding in more detail structure-\n\nrelated aspects of such biomaterials from a functional point of view. \n\n\n\nChapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules \n\n \n\n123 \n\nTaking advantage of genetic recombination approaches, one can easily \u201cengineer\u201d a peptide-based \n\nmacromolecule exhibiting characteristics that can be tuned for specific fields: skin substitutes, vascular \n\nconstructs, drug delivery devices and functional interfaces. Their functionality can be further expanded \n\nby adding sequences with biological relevance to the common elastin structure, like cell adhesion-, \n\ntissue-specific- and degradation-motifs. Complex, well-defined and tailored polymers can be obtained \n\nwith a wide range of properties and possibilities for new devices. One could say that such degree of \n\ncomplexity is only limited by the imagination of the scientist: it still needs to be faithful to the original \n\nproperties of elastin-like macromolecules, though, since an unfavorable modification can lead to a non-\n\nfunctional polypeptide. \n\nThe study and use of elastin-like macromolecules is leading to the design of new cutting-edge and more \n\ncomplex ones emerging as promising candidates for future treatments. Their smart behavior and self-\n\nassembly properties may be exploited for further tuning and ultimate control of the performance of an \n\nelastin-based system, like how a specific cell phenotype will bind to a substrate, or how an active agent \n\nwill be released under stimuli variations and biological conditions. \n\n3.7 Acknowledgements \n\nWe acknowledge financial support from the Portuguese Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia \u2013 FCT \n\n(grant SFRH/BD/61126/2009), Fundo Social Europeu \u2013 FSE, Programa Diferencial de Potencial \n\nHumano/POPH, the European Commission through the 7th Framework Programme (projects HEALTH-\n\nF4-2011-278557 and NMP3-LA-2011-263363), from the Spanish Minister of Economy and \n\nCompetitiveness \u2013 MEC (projects MAT2009-14195-C03-03, MAT-2010-15982, MAT2010-15310, \n\nIT2009-0089, ACI2009-0890 and PRI-PIBAR-2011-1403), the Junta de Castilla y Le\u00f3n -JCyL (projects \n\nVA034A09 and VA0049A11-2), the CIBER-BBN (project CB06-01-1038), and the JCyL and the Instituto \n\nde Salud Carlos III under the \u201cNetwork Center of Regenerative Medicine and Cellular Therapy of Castilla \n\nand Le\u00f3n\u201d. \n\n3.8 References \n\n[1] Almine J.

Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications\n4\n \n\n4.1 Introduction \n\nSurface engineering is a field of expertise dealing with the modification and improvement of interfaces. \n\nIn conventional medicine, the surface properties of an implantable device are regarded with the utmost \n\nimportance since the first contact with the organism is mediated by the interface with the organism. \n\nThis interaction is what drives the subsequent tissue and cellular events, including protein adsorption, \n\ncell adhesion, and inflammatory response [1-3]. \n\nA device which surface is modified is often perceived as a static product that gives rise to an improved \n\ninterface while retaining the mechanical bulk properties. However, specific applications may require that \n\nsuch interface is dynamic. In these cases, a surface should be able to respond towards external factors \n\nand considered as a step forward when developing systems with increasing complexity in healthcare, \n\nbiomedicine and tissue engineering applications. An example of such a dynamic system is our own skin. \n\nSkin can be perceived as a multifunctional membrane that responds to its environment. Its reaction is \n\ndifferent when exposed to distinct conditions \u2013 heat/cold, humidity, chemical/mechanical stress and \n\nlight \u2013 and constitutes an elegant example of a sensorial stimuli-responsive structure found in \n\nNature [4]. Such mechanism can be found in many other living processes: they can use \n\nmacromolecules as construction elements or parts of cell machinery, including proteins/enzymes, \n\npolysaccharides and nucleic acids that typically exhibit a clear non-linear and reversible behavior. Some \n\nare stable along wide ranges of some external variables and undergo drastic conformational changes \n\nupon narrow variations around given critical points [5-7]. \n\nInspired by natural examples, stimuli-responsive surfaces have been developed in the past two decades, \n\noften recurring to materials that exhibit reversible property switchability. These surfaces are capable of \n\nreversibly changing their properties depending on the environmental conditions, such as temperature, \n\npH, ionic strength, light, electrical fields and biomolecules [8-10]. Thanks to their properties, stimuli-\n\nresponsive materials have been used to develop \u201csmart\u201d surfaces with significant potential in the fields \n\n                                                 \n4\n This chapter is based on the following publication: \n\nCosta R.

Most of them often rely on the use of physical or chemical methods, such as plasma and \n\nion-beam sputtering [15]. However, in most cases, they are not suitable to produce stimuli-\n\nresponsiveness. Meanwhile, other techniques were introduced with capability of rendering a substrate \n\nwith smart properties and will discussed in the following sections. \n\n4.2.1  Self-assembled monolayers \n\nSelf-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are ordered molecular assemblies formed by the self-assembly of \n\nan active surfactant onto a solid surface. In these two-dimensional systems, order is achieved by a \n\nspontaneous chemical synthesis at the interface [16]. The self-assembling molecules consist generally \n\nof three groups: (i) a head group, (ii) an alkyl chain and (ii) a terminal end group. The head group is \n\nresponsible for the anchoring of the molecules onto the substrate (see Figure 4.1a). The alkyl chain, or \n\nspacer group, provides the stability of the monolayer, through van der Waals interactions. The terminal \n\nend group introduces chemical functionality into the monolayer system and is important for the overall \n\nproperties of surfaces [17]. \n\nSurface chemistry represents an important tool for the preparation of a large variety of differently \n\nfunctionalized SAMs bearing a diversity of functional groups. There are three main approaches one can \n\nfollow to obtain a suitable functional surface: (i) nucleophilic substitution, (ii) click chemistry and (iii) \n\nsupramolecular modification. The first is a process through which a nucleophile (such as hydroxide, \n\ncyanide and ammonia) attacks an atom with a positive or partially positive charge connected to a \n\nnegative or neutral leaving group [18]. Click chemistry generates substances by joining small units \n\ntogether with heteroatom links. Kolb, Finn and Sharpless [19] first introduced click chemistry as a \n\ntechnique that uses C\u2013C bonds as a \u201ccurrency\u201d. Finally, the supramolecular modification is achieved by \n\nthe functionalization of surfaces with tailor-made supramolecular binding motifs through specific \n\ninteractions with the surface [20]. \n\n\n\nChapter 4. Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications \n\n \n\n141 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1. Schematic structure of interfaces formed by (a) self-assembled monolayer, (b) thin \n\npolymer network films, (c) grafting and (d) layer-by-layer. \n\n \n\nSAMs can be assembled by adsorption of a variety of functional organic molecules onto suitable solid \n\nsubstrates. For instance, long-chain alkanethiols bearing a terminal functional group spontaneously \n\nassemble onto gold to form densely packed and ordered monolayers [21]. They are the most commonly \n\nused materials for SAMs and \u2013 besides gold \u2013 can be assembled onto noble metals, such as silver and \n\nplatinum [22,23]. Other combinations of adsorbates and substrates include silane compounds onto \n\nsilicon oxide and titanium [24,25], and phosphonic acids onto titanium [26]. \n\nUnfortunately, the specificity of SAMS is a shortcoming: they can only be fabricated upon the adsorption \n\nof specific molecules onto specific surfaces. Furthermore, the resulting monolayers show generally a \n\nlimited stability under ambient and physiological conditions, leading to facile exchange and \u201cstripping\u201d \n\nof the adsorbates [27]. Nonetheless, SAMs have thrived because they are easy to prepare as they do \n\nnot require any specialized equipment for their preparation and can be constructed on objects of \n\ndifferent size and shape such as thin films, nano-particles/wires/cages in colloids, with clear impact in \n\nnanoscience and nanotechnology. In particular, SAM-modified surfaces have been constructed to exhibit \n\nsmart properties towards external stimuli such as electrical fields (due to the desorption of \n\nalkanethiolates) [28], light (by the inclusion of azobenzenes or spiropyrans) [29], redox reactions (by the \n\ninclusion of supramolecular rotaxanes) [30] to obtain surfaces for protein separation, diagnostic and \n\nwith switchable wettability. \n\n\n\nChapter 4. Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications \n\n \n\n142 \n\n4.2.2  Thin polymer network films \n\nNanostructured thin network films are structures in which surface confinement brings a range of \n\nopportunities for engineering stimuli-responsive properties. These are polymeric networks \u2013 in many \n\ncases very thin hydrogel films prepared from water-soluble polymers chemically linked to a surface, \n\nresulting in a soft surface with well-defined mechanical, physical and biochemical properties (see Figure \n\n4.1b) [31]. This kind of polymer network provides a soft three-dimensional scaffold similar to that of \n\nmacroscopic hydrogels, capable of hosting a wide-array of functionalities, ranging from proteins to \n\ninorganic nanoparticles, but typically produced at the nano- and micro- scales. They can undergo \n\nsubstantial swelling and contraction in response to external stimuli, making them excellent candidates \n\nfor \u201csmart\u201d surfaces with sensing and actuating characteristics [13]. \n\nThe advantage towards their macroscopic counterparts is that gel thin films exhibit a fast swelling and \n\nshrinkage kinetics. In fact, this behavior was predicted by the Tanaka and Fillmore\u2019s model which states \n\nthat the characteristic time of the swelling transition is directly proportional to the square of the linear \n\nsize of the gel [32]. A critical issue for understanding and predicting the properties of surface-attached \n\npolymer networks is the impact of confinement on their swelling behavior. Chemical linkage of the thin \n\ngel to a surface prevents swelling in the parallel direction to that of the substrate, effectively confining \n\nthe volume change to one dimension. Such an effect has an impact in properties such as the structure, \n\nmechanical properties, dynamics, and permeability of the network [33]. Additionally, the swelling \n\nbehavior of the polymer network is also influenced by the crosslinking degree of the film, as well as the \n\nnature of the polymer, e.g. if it is stimuli-responsive. \n\nAn interesting property of thin gel polymer networks is that they are not limited to surfaces: they can \n\nalso be processed in the form of freestanding films if neither adhesion or covalent bonding to the \n\nsurface is triggered [4]. Therefore, it is possible to synthesize thin responsive membranes that can be \n\nused in the selective separation of molecules and particles. While traditional membranes can perform \n\nthis function based on parameters like size and charge, responsive membranes can demonstrate a \n\ngating function controlled by external stimuli. For instance, pores in the membrane can be switched \n\nbetween an \u201copen\u201d or \u201cclosed\u201d state and allow the passage of specific solution components at a \n\nspecific time in function of one or more stimuli [34,35]. \n\nSummarizing, thin polymer networks have a fast swelling/shrinking response and can accommodate in \n\ntheir bulk various chemicals, biomolecules and nanoparticles. These properties make of thin gel \n\npolymer networks attractive systems in microtechnology, namely as selective membranes, intelligent \n\ndrug delivery devices and biosensors [36-38]. \n\n\n\nChapter 4. Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications \n\n \n\n143 \n\n4.2.3  Grafting \n\nGrafting is a technique by which a polymer is attached to a substrate, usually solid [39]. The bound \n\npolymer chains are often called \u201cgrafts\u201d or \u201cbrushes\u201d and lend their properties to the substrate (see \n\nFigure 4.1c). There are two major approaches of grafting that can be applied: \u201cgrafting-to\u201d and \n\n\u201cgrafting-from\u201d [40-42]. \n\nThe \u201cgrafting-to\u201d method refers to a chemical reaction between an end-functionalized polymer and a \n\nsuitable surface containing complementary functional groups, and requires that the polymer is modified \n\nbeforehand. Reactive end-functionalized polymers can be obtained through techniques such as \n\ncontrolled/living radical polymerization (CRP), group transfer and ring opening metathesis \n\npolymerizations [43-45]. A drawback of the \u201cgrafting-to\u201d approach is the low density yield of the grafted \n\nchains: steric repulsions between polymer chains hamper the formation of dense polymer brushes [46]. \n\nAnother drawback is that with increasing molecular weight of the polymer\u2019s the reaction between the \n\npolymer end-group and the complementary group on the substrate becomes less efficient [47]. \n\nNevertheless, \u201cgrafting-to\u201d is simple to perform and, thanks to the covalent bond formed between \n\nsurface and polymer, the brushes are robust and capable of withstanding both chemical and physical \n\nefforts. \n\nThe \u201cgrafting-from\u201d method refers to the preparation of polymer brushes in which the polymerization is \n\ntriggered by initiator-functionalized surfaces. The immobilization of initiators on the surface can be \n\nachieved by treating the substrate with plasma or glow discharge in the presence of a gas or forming \n\ninitiator-containing SAMs on the substrates. It can produce tethered layers of higher grafting densities \n\nthan the \u201cgrafting-to\u201d approach since the active centers (radicals, ions, and ion pairs) of the growing \n\nchains at the surface are easily accessible for monomer molecules in the swollen brush during the \n\ncourse of polymerization [48,49]. \n\nRegardless of the method \u2013 \u201cto\u201d or \u201cfrom\u201d \u2013 the principles are common to both: (i) the grafting \n\ntechniques imply chemical attachment of polymers to the surface; (ii) the reaction occurs under \n\nappropriate reactive conditions, which are usually specific for the kind of materials and substrates \n\ninvolved; (iii) the polymers can be grafted to distinct types of surfaces, e.g. metals, glasses and silica, \n\nand not limited to planar substrates but also applied to spherical ones; and (iv) the substrates often \n\nassume the properties of the grafted polymer, with stimuli-responsive grafts rendering a smart-\n\nresponsive surface. \n\n\n\nChapter 4. Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications \n\n \n\n144 \n\nA grafted polymer brush can be composed of chains from a single homopolymer \u2013 single-component \n\nhomopolymer brushes \u2013 two or more different homopolymers \u2013 mixed brushes \u2013 or block-copolymers \u2013 \n\nblock-copolymer brushes. In the first case, when dealing with smart surfaces, the responsive behavior \n\noriginates from the inherent properties of the grafted polymer chains, their grafting densities, or by \n\nchanges in the balance between polymer\u2013polymer and polymer-solvent interactions [50]. In mixed \n\npolymer brushes, response comes from phase segregation, which causes the switching of the spatial \n\ndistribution of the functional groups that are exhibited by the brush exterior. Consequently the materials\u2019 \n\nproperties can be switched between among the ones of the constituent polymers [51]. The responsive \n\nbehavior of block copolymer brushes (as in mixed brushes) is based on the phase segregation of the \n\ndifferent blocks. The combination of different polymeric blocks in the responsive film broadens the \n\nrange of properties upon switching, so that the surface changes from the property of one polymer to the \n\nproperty of the second polymer, or is locked in some intermediate state [52]. Graft-modified surfaces \n\nwith stimuli-responsive behavior have been extensively used in biology and nanotechnology. The cell-\n\nsheet technology achieved through the attachment of poly(N -isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAAm), a \n\nthermoresponsive polymer, is one of the most representative examples of the grafting approach in \n\ntissue engineering [50]. Other applications based on other and stimuli (e.g. pH and ionic strength) have \n\nalso been addressed, such as the switchable wettability of substrates, controlled release of drug delivery \n\ndevices and sensors. \n\n4.2.4  Layer-by-layer \n\nLayer-by-layer (LbL) is a self-assembly-driven surface modification strategy that allows the construction \n\nof nanostructured films onto distinct geometries, from simple bidimensional surfaces to more complex \n\nthree-dimensional porous structures. The principle behind it lies in the existence of multiple \n\nintermolecular interactions where the cooperative effects of multipoint attractions play the most \n\nimportant role (see Figure 4.1d) [11,53,54]. Constructing a multilayer film usually has two \n\nrequirements: (i) a reactive surface as the assembly support and (ii) a combination of two or more \n\ningredients for the constitution of the film that can interact with each other. The buildup process is \n\ninitiated by dipping the substrate in a solution of one ingredient that shows complementary interactions \n\nwith the surface, forming therefore the first layer. Then another ingredient follows, interacting with the \n\npreformed layer, assembling a second one. Between each dip, a rinsing step is performed to remove \n\nexcess of non-adhered material from the interface. In comparison with SAMs and polymer brushes, \n\nusually neither the surface nor the ingredients require modification prior to the LbL construction since \n\n\n\nChapter 4. Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications \n\n \n\n145 \n\nassembling the layers rely on the intrinsic properties of each counterpart and their spontaneous \n\nassembly. \n\nUsually the most important requirement is that two distinct materials possess complementarity, i.e. that \n\nthe properties of both materials result in attraction. In other words, LbL is a generic surface \n\nmodification technique with which (in theory) any material and surface can be used for this end, in \n\nopposition to the methods described in the previous sections. The most representative buildup \n\nmechanism relies on electrostatic interactions among surface/ingredient and ingredient/ingredient. For \n\ninstance, a polycation can be adsorbed to a negatively charged surface to form a layer. A polyanion can \n\nthen adsorb to the now positively charged interface, rendering it with a negative charge [55]. This \n\nprocess can be repeated as many times as necessary under aqueous conditions to construct films with \n\nthickness at the order of a few nanometers to tens of micrometers. Although electrostatic self-assembly \n\n(ESA) is the most exploited mechanism, other interactions can be present, such as hydrophobic \n\ninteractions and hydrogen bonding [53,56]. \n\nLbL offers ease of preparation at mild conditions of temperature, pressure and pH, versatility, fine \n\ncontrol over the materials structure and robustness under physiological conditions. Additionally, the \n\nmild and non-aggressive processing conditions of LbL make of it an appealing technique for tissue \n\nengineering applications. There is a vast choice of available materials that one can add to a multilayer \n\nformulation, such as proteins, nucleic acids, polysaccharides, and virus particles, as well as various \n\norganic polymers, molecular assemblies [57-59]. and inorganic substances (e.g. clay platelets [60], \n\ngrapheme [61] and glass nanoparticles [62]). Furthermore, although LbL has been first introduced as a \n\nsurface engineering technique of planar surfaces [63], the concept has been extrapolated to 3D. The \n\nsequential mechanism of layer adsorption can be extrapolated to construct thick membrane-like films \n\nwith tens of micrometers assembled on non-adhesive substrates (e.g. through van der Waals \n\ninteractions with polypropylene) to produce freestanding films [64]. Other types of complex geometries \n\nwith distinct shapes and sizes and as a result, devices such as porous scaffolds and drug delivery \n\ncapsules can now exhibit new properties with the option of further tuning by varying the nature of the \n\nLbL ingredients and number of layers [65,66]. \n\nLbL films and shells can contain stimuli-responsive ingredients in order to render a system with a smart \n\nresponse. Exploiting the advantages of LbL and intelligent multilayer systems have already been \n\nproposed for different biomedical applications, including for biomimetic composite-like coatings, to \n\ncontrol the release of drugs, or to manipulate the adhesion of attached cells. In particular, systems \n\nassembled using weak polyelectrolytes (e.g. chitosan and alginate) are inherently responsive towards \n\n\n\nChapter 4. Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications \n\n \n\n146 \n\nionic strength and pH responsive, since they interfere with the electrostatic balance within the internal \n\nstructure of the film [58,67,68]. In similarity with polymer brushes, multilayer films with temperature \n\nresponsive properties have also been fabricated to control the cell attachment/detachment to a surface \n\nfor cell sheet technology, and to fabricate surfaces with acute wettability transitions [69,70]. \n\n4.3 Exploitable stimuli and model smart biomaterials \n\n4.3.1  Physical stimuli \n\n4.3.1.1  Temperature \n\nAmong the stimuli used to control the response, temperature has been extensively studied in the \n\nbiomedical field as certain diseases manifest temperature changes and this factor can be easily \n\ncontrolled and applicable both in vitro and in vivo conditions. Thermo-responsive systems have a critical \n\nsolution temperature at which the phase of the polymer and solution is discontinuously changed \n\naccording to their composition.[8] PNIPAAm is the thermo-responsive polymer most used for conferring \n\nthermo-responsiveness to surfaces. It exhibits a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) at about \n\n32\u00baC in aqueous solution, changing sharply from a hydrophilic to a hydrophobic state upon heating [71]. \n\nIt is believed that this transition involves the breakage of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the \n\nwater molecules and the amide groups in the polymeric chains, which are replaced, above the LCST, by \n\nintramolecular hydrogen bonds amongst the dehydrated amine groups. PNIPAAm has been \n\ncopolymerised with hydrophilic or hydrophobic monomers in order to control the kinetics of the \n\nresponse [72,73]. \n\nTypically, above the LCST of PNIPAAm based surface-grafted polymers, surface wettability decreases \n\nand the thickness of the grafted layer decreases (deswelling). The work of Shi and co-workers [74] \n\nillustrates this behavior for bioactive composites of poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) reinforced with Bioglass\n\u00ae\n \n\n(BG) and grafted with PNIPAAm through the use of plasma activation. The water contact angle for the \n\nPNIPAAm modified PLLA+10% BG composite was 51.9\u00b12.4\u00ba, at 25\u00baC and at 37\u00baC it changed to \n\n58.8\u00b12.4\u00ba, being consistent with the increase in the surface hydrophobicity above the LCST. The range \n\nof wettability can be further amplified to the super- hydrophobic/hydrophilic regimen by using \n\nsubstrates with increasing roughness [75], which is also predicted in the Wenzel model [76]. \n\nBesides the grafting of PNIPAAm-based polymers on distinct substrates, LbL assembling has also been \n\nused to confer temperature-responsiveness to surfaces. Serpe et al. [77] were the first to apply the LbL \n\n\n\nChapter 4. Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications \n\n \n\n147 \n\ntechnique to produce temperature-responsive PNIPAAM/-co-acrylic acid (AA)/polyallylamine coatings. \n\nSince then, LbL surfaces containing PNIPAAm have already been suggested for cell sheet \n\nengineering [70]. \n\nOther thermo-responsive polymers may be used instead of PNIPAAm. Poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) (PVCL) \n\nis another thermo-sensitive polymer that can be deposited onto surfaces, which possesses very \n\ninteresting properties for biomedical applications such as solubility in water, biocompatibility, a \n\ntransition temperature around 31\u00baC and its cytoxicity has been referred as being much lower than the \n\none of PNIPAAm.[78,79] Thermo-sensitive films based on triblock copolymers have also been \n\nprepared [80]. \n\nNature also houses inspiration for the development of new polymers. Elastin-like recombinamers (ELRs) \n\n\u2013 a recombinant class of elastin-like polymers (ELPs) \u2013 are genetically engineered peptide-based \n\nmaterials that mimic the structure of natural elastin [81]. By exploiting microorganism systems, tailored \n\nrecombinant elastins based on the pentapeptide poly(VPGVG) can be produced and, thanks to their \n\nrecombinant nature, recombinant peptides with precision over the primary aminoacid content is \n\npossible, being able to introduce relevant functional sequences, for example to improve cell adhesion, \n\ntrigger biomineralization and vascularization [82-84]. \n\nIn aqueous solution, and below a certain transition temperature (Tt), the free polymer chains are \n\ndisordered, consisting in fully hydrated random coils. When the temperature is increased above Tt, the \n\nstructure loses the water molecules from hydrophobic hydration and the chains fold and assemble into \n\na ?-spiral conformation [85-87]. Although often associated with temperature-responsive polymers, the \n\nfact is that such transition phenomenon can occur due to other stimuli, such as pH, ionic strength, \n\nredox reactions and in specific modifications even due to light. In this perspective, ELRs could be \n\nclassified as a multiple-responsive material, and surfaces modified with this kind of macromolecules \n\nhave already been demonstrated to respond towards temperature, pH and ionic strength at the same \n\ntime [69]. \n\nBiosensing surfaces displaying topologically modified self-assembly with ELRs have been developed by \n\nChilkoti\u2019s group. The \u201cthermodynamically reversible addressing of proteins\u201d (TRAP) technology obtained \n\nby covalent micropatterning of ELRs onto glass surfaces against an inert background allows a reversible, \n\nspatio-temporal modulation of ligand-binding triggered by the phase transition of the ELR at a solid-\n\nliquid interface. Such technology can be applied in different systems for bio-analytical sensors in order \n\nto detect single biomolecules [88,89]. \n\n\n\nChapter 4. Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications \n\n \n\n148 \n\nSmart thin coatings using an ELR containing RGD sequences are also a new and interesting example of \n\nthermo-responsive surfaces. These coatings can be fabricated through simple deposition of the ELR \n\ndissolved in aqueous-based solutions onto chitosan membranes [82]. It was shown that the \n\nconformational changes suffered by the ELR at its inverse temperature transition modified the \n\ntopography at the nanoscale and the wettability of the polymeric substrate, which could be potentially \n\nused to control cell adhesion and protein adsorption (see Figure 4.2). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2. Water drop profiles on ELP-coated substrates at 25 and 50\u00baC. Reprinted (adapted) with \n\npermission from [82]. Copyright 2009 Wiley-VCH. \n\n4.3.1.2  Light \n\nLight could be an interesting stimulus in the context of stimuli-responsive surfaces, as it is widely used \n\nin Nature as a source of energy. Photo-responsive polymers change their properties when irradiated \n\nwith light, due to light-induced structural transformations of specific functional groups (e.g. \n\nchromophores) along the polymer backbone or side chains [90-92]. An important aspect of photo-\n\nsensitive polymer systems is that using irradiation as a stimulus is a relatively straightforward, non-\n\ninvasive mechanism to induce a responsive behavior. The most well studied examples of photo-\n\nresponsive polymers are those that contain azobenzene groups. Azobenzene is a well-known \n\nchromophore with an irradiation-induced cis -to-trans isomerization that is accompanied by a fast and \n\ncomplete change in electronic structure, geometric shape, and polarity. By incorporating azobenzene \n\nderivatives into polymer structures, materials with variable shape, polarity, and self-assembly behavior \n\ncan be obtained [91].  Azochromophores have been incorporated into a variety of polymeric \n\nsystems [10,91]. Other chromophores, namely spiropyran and its derivatives have been incorporated \n\nterminally or pendantly to confer light sensitivity [93,94]. Spiropyran groups are relatively non-polar, but \n\nirradiation with the appropriate wavelength of light leads to the zwitterionic merocyanine isomer that has \n\na larger dipole moment. \n\nIllustrative works where photo-responsive LbL films were prepared can be found elsewhere [91,95]. The \n\nstudies related with photo-responsive LbL systems have shown that the photoresponsive cis \u2013trans -\n\nisomerization rates in the layers are highly dependent on the functional groups attached to the \n\n\n\nChapter 4. Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications \n\n \n\n149 \n\nchromophores [91]. Most of the works regarding photo-responsive polymers require isomerization \n\ninduced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation or visible light. Recent years have also seen a growing interest in \n\nemploying near-infrared (NIR) radiation as a trigger to activate delivery of encapsulated material from \n\nLbL systems [96]. The use of NIR light is particularly attractive in biomedical applications because of \n\nthe weak absorption of NIR radiation by most tissues. \n\nPhoto-isomerizable monolayers applied to surfaces can also be used to control surface properties, such \n\nas wettability [97]. In this case, the water contact angle was found to be lower for the spiropyran-\n\nmodified surfaces after irradiation with UV light, when compared with the contact angle found for visible \n\nlight. This was ascribed to the changes in the surface energy of the surfaces correlated to the switching \n\nof the surface-bound spiropyran molecules between polar, zwitterionic and nonpolar forms. \n\n4.3.2  Chemical stimuli \n\n4.3.2.1  pH \n\n\u201cpH\u201d has also been extensively studied in the biomedical field because this factor can be easily \n\ncontrolled and applicable both in vitro and in vivo conditions. It is well-known that there is a pH change \n\nalong the gastrointestinal tract from the stomach (pH=1\u20133) to the intestine (pH=5\u20138) and chronic \n\nwounds and tumor tissue are also slightly acidic. So, for example, pH-responsive systems can be used \n\nfor releasing drugs in the intestine in order to avoid their degradation in the environment of the \n\nstomach [8]. They have also been investigated for gene delivery and gene therapy. \u201cpH\u201d-responsive \n\npolymers contain ionizable groups that can accept and donate protons in response to a pH change. \n\nExamples of pH-responsive polymers are chitosan, alginate, hyaluronic acid, PAA, poly(ethyleneimine) \n\n(PEI), poly(N,N-dyakylamino ethylmethacrylates (PDAAEMA) and poly-lysine [98]. Grafting of pH-\n\nresponsive polymers has been used to confer pH-responsiveness to a surface. For example, chitosan \n\nwas grafted onto the surface of PLLA/BG composites [99]. In an acidic medium, chitosan becomes \n\npositively charged due to the protonation of the free amine groups. The pH-responsive behavior of the \n\nPLLA/BG composites modified with chitosan was confirmed by contact angle measurements. After \n\nmodification, the contact angle changed from 88.9\u00b14.05\u00ba at pH 7.4 to 67.6\u00b12.3\u00ba at pH 5.4. The \n\nunmodified PLLA/BG composites revealed a hydrophobic character, presenting a contact angle of 82\u00ba, \n\nindependently of the pH. \n\nIn LbL, the growth of polyelectrolyte-based coatings is dependent on pH [100,101]. For instance, for \n\nchitosan/alginate films, a value of 56 nm was obtained for the final thickness of the films built at a pH \n\n\n\nChapter 4. Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications \n\n \n\n150 \n\nof 7.0 and 34 nm for the multilayers assembled at a pH of 5.5 [101]. When the charge density of the \n\nadsorbing species decreases (i.e., chitosan at a pH of 7.0), more polyelectrolyte chains are needed to \n\novercompensate and invert the surface charge, explaining the higher thickness associated with the \n\ndeposition of polymers at pH 7.0. Also, LbL coatings of polyelectrolytes respond intrinsically to pH. \n\nMultilayer films conceived with chitosan and ELRs were demonstrated to be pH-responsive [69]. At high \n\npH values, the roughness of the substrates increased due to the triggering of the ELR self-assembly \n\nmechanism into aggregates, besides the variation of the internal electrostatic interactions. \n\nMicro- and nano-scale porosity can be introduced in LbL films by pH variations, thus allowing to control \n\nfilm permeability [102,103]. \n\n4.3.2.2  Ionic strength \n\nPolymers that contain ionizable groups are typically sensitive to ionic strength. In fact, due to the \n\nattractive Coulombic interactions between oppositely charged species, such polymers may be insoluble \n\nin deionized water but soluble in the presence of a determined oncentration of added electrolytes where \n\nthe attractive charge/charge interactions are shielded, as higher ionic strength solutions reduce the \n\nrange of electrostatic interactions [104]. So, changes in the ionic strength can lead to changes in the \n\npolymer solubility and, therefore, in the length of the deposited polymer chains. Ionic strength is also an \n\nimportant parameter that allows controlling film swelling. In the case poly-lysine/hyaluronic acid LbL \n\nfilms prepared at an ionic strength of 0.15 M in NaCl, reversible swelling and deswelling occurs when \n\nthe ionic strength is cycled between 0.15 and 0.225 M [105]. Ionic strength has also been used to \n\ncontrol the permeability of LbL films as ionic variations can introduce porosity [106]. \n\n4.3.3  Biochemical stimuli \n\n4.3.3.1  Antigens \n\nAntigen-antibody interactions have been also explored under the scope of stimuli-responsive surfaces. \n\nSuch interactions are quite specific and associated with the complex immune responses that help \n\nrecognize and neutralize foreign infection-causing objects in the body. \n\nAi and co-workers [107] showed that platelets coated with anti-\u201cimmunoglobulin G\u201d (IgG) multilayers \n\ncould be targeted to IgG-coated surfaces. An antigen responsive membrane based on dextran grafted \n\nwith both a fluorescent fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) antigen and anti-FITC IgC antibody was \n\nproposed by Zhang and co-workers [108]. When free sodium fluorescein was added to the membrane, \n\n\n\nChapter 4. Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications \n\n \n\n151 \n\nantibody-antigen crosslinks were broken by competitive binding of the free antigen. The disruption of the \n\ncrosslinks caused the reversible swelling of the membrane. So, such membranes could be used as \n\ngates for selective diffusion controlled by the presence of an antigen. \n\n4.3.3.2  Enzymes \n\nBacteria located mainly in the colon produce reductive enzymes (e.g. azoreductase) or hydrolytic \n\nenzymes (e.g. glycosidases) capable of degrading various types of polysaccharides, such as pectin, \n\nchitosan, amylase/amylopectin, cyclodextrin and dextrin [109-111]. For example, polymer systems \n\nbased on alginate/chitosan are responsive to chitosanase and azoaromatic bonds are sensitive to \n\nazoreductase [112,113]. Enzyme responsive polymers present the advantage of not requiring an \n\nexternal trigger for decomposing, exhibit high selectivity and work under mild conditions, although is not \n\nstraightforward to determine the beginning of degradation. An interesting example regarding enzyme-\n\nresponsive surfaces are the ones developed by Todd and co-workers, which present cell adhesive \n\narginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) sequences on-demand, that is, by enzymatic hydrolysis of inactive \n\nRGD containing precursors that carry cleavable steric blocking groups [114]. \n\n4.3.3.3  Glucose \n\nGlucose-responsive polymers can be specifically used in the controlled relase of insulin and for glucose \n\nsensing. Typically, glucose oxidase (GOX) is conjugated to a pH-sensitive polymer [115]. GOX oxidizes \n\nglucose to gluconic acid, inducing a pH change and the corresponding release of the insulin \n\nencapsulated in the pH-system. For example Imanashi and co-workers [116] grafted GOX-conjugated \n\nPAA onto a cellulose film. At neutral and high pH the PAA chains were extended due to the negative \n\ncharged of the carboxylate groups, occluding the pores of the cellulose membrane. The gluconic acid \n\nthat resulted from the addition of glucose led to a local pH decrease, protonation and subsequent \n\ncollapse of the PAA chains, leading to the insulin release. \n\n4.3.4  Multiple responsive surfaces \n\nSmart surfaces that respond simultaneously to more than one stimulus could be particularly interesting \n\nregarding biomedical applications and could be used, for instance, to control in a more effective way \n\ndrug release or cell response. Some representative works where this type of surfaces was developed will \n\nnow be given. For example, dual responsive coatings of chitosan-graft-NIPAAm and alginate were \n\n\n\nChapter 4. Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications \n\n \n\n152 \n\nbuilt [70]. AFM analysis confirmed that PNIPAAm is able to reconform upon temperature swaps even \n\nwhen combined with other layers in a polyelectrolyte multilayer, demonstrating that the nano-\n\nassemblies are thermo-responsive. In another work, a smart and stable polymer brush interface based \n\non PNIPAAm, PAA and poly(NIPAAm-co-AA) was able to reversibly respond to temperature, ionic \n\nstrength and pH, independently or simultaneously [117]. \n\nThermo- and pH- sensitive films of poly(N,N -dimethyl aminoethyl methacrylate)-poly(propylene oxide)-\n\npoly(N,N -dimethyl aminoethyl methacrylate)/PAA ((PD-PPO-PD)/PAA) were prepared by Tan and co-\n\nworkers [80]. These films present a thickness of 2150 nm at 6\u00baC and of 941 nm at 20\u00baC, when they \n\nwere deposited from distilled water at pH 7. This volumetric transition does not occur any more when \n\nthe same films were prepared from water at pH 4 because PPO already forms hydrogen bonds with \n\nPAA (mostly in the protonated, neutral form) which are not available any more for water molecules. \n\nOther interesting example of multi-responsive coatings are the PNIPAAm-co-AA copolymers sensitive to \n\npH and temperature that were prepared by Xia and co-workers [75]. The combination of this dual \n\nstimuli-responsive coating combined with surface micro and nanostructure enabled the water contact \n\nangle (CA) of the surface to be controlled over a range of 150\u00ba. On a flat surface, however, the CA \n\nchange was only 13\u00ba and 9.6\u00ba for a temperature range of 21\u201345\u00baC and a pH range of 2\u201311, \n\nrespectively. \n\n4.4 Biomedical applications of smart surfaces \n\n4.4.1  Smart coatings for tissue engineering, regenerative medicine and drug \n\ndelivery applications \n\nSmart coatings can be used to control the properties of the surface of a substrate, such as an implant, \n\nby changing the surface chemistry, topography and/or hydrophobicity, and therefore modifying protein \n\nadsorption and cell adhesion. These coatings can be simultaneously used to release a drug or bioactive \n\ncompound in a controlled way. Some representative examples of smart biomaterial coatings will now be \n\npresented. \n\nProtein adsorption on PNIPAAm coatings has been investigated by distinct authors, showing that \n\nadsorption is typically unfavorable below the LCST, being stronger above the LCST [118-120]. For some \n\nproteins and some conditions, protein adsorption might become irreversible, inhibiting repeated \n\nswitching. It was found that protein adsorption reversibility on PNIPAAm coatings depends whether the \n\n\n\nChapter 4. Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications \n\n \n\n153 \n\nphase transition back to the hydrated protein resistant state is energetically more favorable than the \n\ninteractions formed between chains and the protein in the collapsed state [119]. \n\nSeveral studies have focused on the influence of the LbL film composition on protein \n\nadsorption [121,122]. For instance, the adsorption of human serum albumin (HSA) onto \n\nchitosan/alginate multilayer assemblies was assessed in situ using QCM-D [123]. It was found that the \n\nbehavior of human serum albumin (HAS) on biomaterials surface can be tuned by adjusting parameters \n\nof the polyelectrolyte system such as pH, layer number, crosslinker and polymer terminal layer. The key \n\nrole of electrostatic interactions during HSA adsorption was evidenced in that work, since oppositely \n\ncharged surfaces were more effective in promoting protein adhesion. Also, novel protein-based systems \n\nhave been developed by self-assembly, introducing the possibility to prepare, in a controllable way, thin \n\nreservoirs of proteins [124] and, by embedding biologically active proteins, film functionalization can be \n\nachieved [125]. The LbL approach has enabled protein encapsulation to release active proteins in a \n\nway that is applicable to objects of any desired geometry and size scale [126]. Moreover, microcapsules \n\nwith a hierarchical shell-within-shell structure of different proteins entrapped in polymeric layers have \n\nbeen developed [127]. \n\nIn the field of active molecule release, it is also very interesting to develop LbL films in which one of the \n\ncomponents hydrolyses above a critical pH value leading to film erosion and release of the active \n\nmolecule. This concept has been used for the pH triggered release of anionic polysaccharides and of \n\ndeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from poly-(?-amino ester)-DNA films [67,128]. The decomposition or \n\nrelease of active compounds can also occur through enzymatic hydrolysis [129]. For example, DNA and \n\nnon-activated DNAase were co-encapsulated in hollow polyelectrolyte capsules. The enzyme can be \n\nactivated by a chemical trigger which diffuses through the polyelectrolyte membrane, activating the \n\nenzyme, the subsequent hydrolysis of DNA and the diffusion of small oligonucleotides through the \n\ncapsule wall [130]. LbL can also be used to coat inorganic microspheres to conceive smart \n\nmicroreservoirs. Huang and Chang [131] developed multilayer microcapsules made of azido- and \n\nacetylene-functionalized PNIPAAm that shrunk upon increasing the temperature from 25 to 50\u00baC \n\n(Figure 4.3). These microcapsules were also permeable to low-molecular weight substances, such as \n\ndextran. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4. Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications \n\n \n\n154 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3.

Reprinted (adapted) with \n\npermission from [131]. Copyright 2009 American Chemical Society. \n\n \n\nThere are many other interesting examples related with the field of active molecule release. For \n\ninstance, pH-responsive polymers may be used to deliver fragile biomolecules such as peptides or \n\noligonucleotides to the cytoplasm of macrophages, as the work of Murthy and co-workers \n\nevidenced [132]. They used pH cleavable acetal linkages to remove poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) grafts \n\nthat mask the delivery vehicle and disrupt the endosome causing the delivery of biomolecules into the \n\ncytoplasm before they are degraded in the lysosomes. PNIPAAm/-co-AA microgels/polyallylamine \n\ncoatings retained their thermo-responsiveness within the multilayer and allowed their use for thermally \n\ntriggered release of insulin [133]. An antimicrobial coating that can simultaneously discourage bacteria \n\nattachment to the implant surface and release, in a tuneable dosage and rate, antibiotics into the \n\nsurrounding tissues has also been developed [134]. \n\nRegarding the use of smart surfaces to control cell response, several works can also be found in \n\nliterature. For example, Picart et al. [135] investigated the effect of grafting an RGD peptide onto distinct \n\nLbL films on the adhesion of primary cells, and observed an enhanced cell proliferation for the \n\nfunctionalized films. Boura et al. [136] evaluated the adhesion properties of endothelial cell on two \n\ntypes of polyelectrolyte films ending either by polylysine, or poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH), and \n\ncompared them to data obtained on polylysine  or PAH monolayers, glass and fibronectin-coated glass. \n\nThey found that the cells seeded on the LbL films showed a good morphology and resisted to \n\nphysiological shear stress better, when compared to the cell seeded on glass or fibronectin. \n\nPhoto-responsive layers composed of made of PNIPAAm and spiropyrans have been used to tailor cell \n\nadhesion by switching light on or off [95]. Cell adhesion has also been photo-chemically controlled \n\n\n\nChapter 4. Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications \n\n \n\n155 \n\nusing RGD-functionalized azobenzene poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) surfaces [137]. It was found \n\nthat azobenzenes enhanced cell adhesion but, upon UV-irradiation-induced trans -cis isomerization, \n\nwhich shortened the distance of the RGD-containing peptides from the surface, cell adhesion decreased. \n\nNakanishi et al. [138] built self-assembled monolayers having photo-cleavable 2-nitrobenzyl groups that \n\ncould be used to template cell adhesion. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), inert to cell adhesion, was \n\nadsorbed over this monolayer. Upon exposing defined regions with UV light, BSA was released from \n\nsuch regions. Finally, fibronectin, a protein promoting cell adhesion, was then incubated and covered \n\nthe irradiated regions. This method allowed producing patterned regions for cell adhesions and by \n\nsubsequent illumination it could be also possible to induce cell migration and proliferation. \n\n4.4.2  Smart biomineralization \n\nIn medical devices for orthopaedic applications, either under traditional replacement concepts or \n\nregeneration strategies, such as tissue engineering, it is important to promote the production of \n\nbonelike apatite onto the biomaterial\u2019s surface. It has been shown that surface biomimetic \n\nmineralization may be triggered by either temperature or pH [74,99]. For PNIPAAm modified composite \n\nPLLA film with 10% BG, it was found that the conformational changes occurring at the surface affect the \n\nmineral formation below and above the LCST [74]. No mineral phase could be observed at 25\u00baC after 2 \n\nweeks in simulated body fluid (SBF). However, at 37\u00baC the treated film could form dense precipitates \n\nwith the typical cauliflower morphology, containing needle-like nanometric structures, characteristic of \n\nbiomimetic-formed apatite. Moreover, by exposing some regions of the surface to the plasma treatment, \n\na patterning could be made to combine stimuli and spatial control of biomimetic apatite [74]. This \n\nallowed the insertion of PNIPAAm in specific chosen areas. Again, no apatite formation was observed \n\nfor these modified films at 25\u00baC. On the other hand, apatite aggregates were formed at 37\u00baC, with a \n\ncircular shape and randomly distributed over the composite surface, being consistent with the \n\nPNIPAAm patterning generated during the plasma activation step. These apatite patterned surfaces \n\ncould be used in fundamental studies on differentiation, adhesion, proliferation and cell-cell signaling of \n\nbone-related cells. These surfaces could also be used in fundamental co-culture studies involving bone \n\ncells and other cell types [139,140]. \n\nFor chitosan-modified PLLA/BG composites no apatite formation was found at pH 5.4 [99]. On the \n\nother hand, a dense apatite layer of a carbonated apatite mineral similar to the major mineral \n\ncomponent of vertebrate bone tissue was formed at pH 7.4. For the unmodified substrates an apatite \n\n\n\nChapter 4. Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications \n\n \n\n156 \n\nlayer was formed at both pH. Temperature and pH were chosen in the above mentioned works, but this \n\nconcept of smart apatite formation can be extended for other source of responsiveness and for other \n\ntype of mineral deposition. \n\n4.4.3  Cell sheet engineering \n\nThe use of smart surfaces, specifically thermo-responsive surfaces, has been applied to the so-called \n\n\u201ccell sheet engineering\u201d. This technology has been proposed to construct ideal transplantable tissues \n\ncomposed exclusively of cells [141]. Initially, Okano and co-workers proposed temperature-responsive \n\ncell culture polystyrene substrates prepared by the grafting of PNIPAAm onto these surfaces, which \n\nallow the culture of confluent cell monolayers at 37?C and their recovery as single cell sheets when the \n\ntemperature is below the LCST of PNIPAAm. Afterwards, they have combined these smart surfaces with \n\npatterning, with the aim of producing complicated three-dimensional tissues [142-145]. For instance, \n\nmicropatterned dual thermo-responsive surfaces that enable the culture and recovery of patterned \n\nheterotopic cell sheets were proposed [142,143]. \n\nOkano and co-workers have shown that it is possible to obtain cell sheet constructs with five layers, \n\nwhere the viability of the transferred cells and the adequate organization of the functional cell-cell \n\njunctions were demonstrated [144]. Direct transplantations of cell sheets have been already \n\nsuccessfully applied to corneal epithelia, mucosal epithelia, periodontal ligament cells, bladder epithelia \n\nand esophageal epithelia [141]. Cell sheets have also been layered in order to successfully recreate \n\nthicker tissue-like constructs such as cardiac and more recently bone [146]. \n\nThe LbL approach has also been explored as a potential alternative to the traditional grafting techniques \n\nemployed for cell sheet engineering. It was shown that (chitosan-graft-NIPAAm)/alginate LbL films \n\nenabled the attachment and proliferation until confluence of cells at 37\u00baC and the spontaneous \n\ndetachment of cell sheets along with their deposited extracellular matrix by simple temperature \n\nmodulation (Figure 4.4) [70]. Thus, these multilayered thermo-responsive surfaces could potentially be \n\nused in cell sheet engineering. The mild conditions and the absence of harmful solvents, the simplicity \n\nof the method and the ability to modulate cellular adhesiveness by controlling the \u201cnanometric\u201d \n\nthickness of the coatings are some of the advantages of this novel strategy. A completely new strategy \n\nfor cell culture focusing on the design of three-dimensional smart surfaces by supercritical fluid \n\ntechnology has also been recently proposed based on supercritical carbon dioxide [147]. This approach \n\nmight overcome the limitations on cell expansion and harvesting of currently existing techniques. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4.

Although many of these concepts are still under development \n\nin the lab bench, substrates modified with stimuli-responsive properties have already been proposed for \n\ncontrolling the adhesion of cells or proteins, microfluidics and biosensors. \n\nFrom the literature, it is clear that such advances are owed to the variety of methods that one can use \n\nto modify an interface and to the wide array of materials that can be used to build it. Thus substrates \n\nthat respond to distinct physical, chemical and biochemical stimuli can be made with potential for new \n\ncutting-edge applications in biology and biotechnology. In the next decade, we expect to assist to the \n\nrise of dynamic smart systems with new designs and complexity moving further into the third dimension. \n\nSwitchable surfaces exhibiting alternating biological active signals will be used to develop new cell \n\nculture protocols. Substrates with dynamic molecular conformation upon the contact with a specific \n\nbiochemical agent will be used as biosensors for rapid diagnostic. Stimuli-responsive interfaces built \n\nonto drug reservoirs will be further optimized to tune and control better the release of encapsulated \n\ntherapeutic molecules. With such nature, smart surfaces offer opportunities for a wide array of \n\napplications in medicine and tissue engineering where an interface with switchable properties is needed. \n\n4.6 Acknowledgements \n\nWe acknowledge financial support from the Portuguese \"Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia\" \u2013 FCT \n\n(grant SFRH/BD/61126/2009), \"Fundo Social Europeu\" \u2013 FSE, \"Programa Diferencial de Potencial \n\n\n\nChapter 4.

Materials and methods \n\n \n\n173 \n\n Chapter 5. Materials and methods \n\nMany of the materials used in this thesis \u2013 both polymeric constituents and reactives \u2013 were either \n\npurchased or obtained by biological processes. The detailed specifications of the suppliers can be found \n\nin the experimental subsections of each chapter of Section III. Likewise, equipment suppliers are also \n\ndiscriminated in those subsections. \n\n5.1 Materials \n\n5.1.1 Polysaccharides \n\nSeveral polysaccharides were used for the conception of multiple layer-by-layer (LbL) constructs. \n\nNamely, chitosan (CHI) was used in every experimental work, throughout chapters 6 to 11. CHI is a \n\nbiodegradable linear polysaccharide composed of randomly distributed N -D-glucosamine and N -\n\nacetyl-D-glucosamine, linked by ?-(1-4) glycosidic bonds (Figure 5.1a). It is obtained by partial \n\ndeacetylation of chitin \u2013 which is found in the exoskeleton of shellfish, like shrimp and crabs \u2013 in the \n\nsolid state under strong alkaline conditions or by enzymatic hydrolysis in the presence of a chitin \n\ndeacetylase. In this process, named N - deacetylation, the acetyl functional groups of chitin are removed. \n\nConventionally, the compound is called \u201cchitosan\u201d when the degree of deacetylation of chitin reaches \n\nabout 50%. CHI undergoes a conformational transition in solution around a pH value of 6. Its amine \n\ngroups, as is characteristic of polybases, are protonated at pH below the pKa and deprotonated at \n\nhigher pH values [1-3]. \n\nLevan is a linear ?-(2-6)-linked fructose polymer (fructan) exhibiting hydroxyl groups that form strong \n\nadhesive bonds with various substrates (Figure 5.1b). This polymer \u2013 which was used along CHI in \n\nChapter 6 \u2013 can be produced by almost every fructan synthesizers: one particular example is levan \n\nproduced by extremophilic and halophilic bacteria Halomonas smyrnensis (Figure 5.2). They are found \n\nin highly saline environments to provide adhesion and protection. The fact that superior \n\nbioadhesiveness can be achieved under such harsh conditions points to the excellent adhesive \n\nproperties that levan and its derivatives can provide. In comparison to petrochemically-derived \n\nadhesives, levan is biodegradable, biocompatible, nonallergic, nontoxic and water-soluble, useful \n\nproperties for high-value biomedical applications [4-6]. \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n174 \n\nOccasionally, alginate (ALG) was also used as a multilayer constituent, in Chapters 6, 7 and 11. ALG is \n\na linear anionic copolymer composed of two monomers: ?-D-mannuronic acid, ?-L-guluronic acid \n\n(Figure 5.1c). It can be obtained from the cellular wall, accounting for up to 45% of the dry weight of \n\nthese seaweeds. ALG has stimuli-responsiveness toward pH. The carboxylic acid groups from the \n\nguluronate and mannuronate monomers can be deprotonated above pH values of 3.2 and 4, \n\nrespectively. Thus, alginate behaves as polyacid and exhibits polyanionic behavior above these pKa \n\nvalues [7-10]. ALG and also CHI, which share a marine origin, both show biocompatibility, adhesiveness, \n\nnontoxicity, as well as bacteriostatic, fungistatic, antimicrobial and hemostatic activities [10-12]. These \n\nproperties make of these polysaccharides suitable constituents for multilayer formulations that resort to \n\nnatural materials. \n\n \n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c)\n\n \n\nFigure 5.1.

Materials and methods \n\n \n\n175 \n\nAll materials used in the present thesis were bought from specialized commercial distributors. Among \n\nthe purchased materials were CHI and ALG: medium molecular weight chitosan (Brookshield viscosity \n\n200-800 cP, molecular weight 190-310 kDa) and alginic acid sodium salt from brown algae (molecular \n\nweight 100-200 kDa). The sodium salt group enabled ALG to solubilize in water more easily, in \n\ncomparison to its unmodified form. Levan was obtained by biological processes, as described below. \n\nChitosan as-received often contains impurities and debris resulting from the deacetylation process of \n\nchitin and requires a purification procedure. Purification of CHI exploits the fact that it undergoes a \n\nconformational transition in solution around a pH value around 6, making it soluble below this value \n\nand precipitate above it. For purification a method described by Signini and Filho [13] was adapted. A \n\nCHI solution at 1% (w/v) using acetic acid at 1% (v/v) as solvent was prepared. The solution was \n\nvacuum-filtered twice through filter papers with 20\u201325 ?m of pore size, to remove impurities. The \n\nfiltered solution was neutralized using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at a molar concentration of 1 M and \n\nwas added drop-wise until pH was 8. The precipitated chitosan was then repeatedly rinsed in distilled \n\nwater until the pH of the residual waters meets the same value of distilled water (around pH 7). CHI \n\nwas rinsed with ethanol, vacuum-filtered and stored at -80 \u00baC before being lyophilized. \n\n5.1.1.1 Microbial levan production \n\nFor Chapter 6, levan was produced by halophilic Halomonas smyrnensis AAD6T batch cultures using \n\npretreated sugar beet molasses as substrate. For this, molasses subjected to tricalcium phosphate, \n\nsulphuric acid and activated carbon pre-treatment was added to sterile production medium (7 g?L\n-1\n\n \n\ndipotassium phosphate (K2HPO4); 2 g?L\n-1\n\n monopotassium phosphate (KH2PO4); 0.1 g.L\n-1\n\n magnesium \n\nsulfate heptahydrate (MgSO4?7H2O); 1 g.L\n-1\n\n ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4); 0.5 g?L\n-1\n\n peptone; \n\n137.2 g?L\n-1\n\n sodium chloride (NaCl) to 30 g?L\n-1\n\n final carbohydrate concentration and after inoculation, \n\ncells were incubated in an orbital shaker set at 37\u00baC and 180 rotations per minute (rpm) agitation rate. \n\nAfterwards, cells from the stationary phase cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 11000g for 20 \n\nminutes and the supernatant phases were treated with an equal volume of ethanol, held at -18\u00baC \n\novernight, and then centrifuged at 16000g and 4\u00baC for 30 min using a refrigerated centrifuge. The \n\npellets were dissolved in hot distilled water, dialyzed against several runs of distilled water for 3 days \n\nand lyophilized. The typical results of this procedure is a levan polymer with a molar mass of at least \n\n1000 kDa [14]. \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n176 \n\n5.1.1.2 Levan phosphonate modification \n\nLevan as-produced does not possess groups exhibiting electrostatic charge. For the purpose of \n\nproducing multilayer films with CHI driven by electrostatic interactions, phosphonate groups were \n\nintroduced in the structure of levan. This way, it was expected that the introduced groups provided \n\nnegative charge for interaction with the polycationic CHI. For the production of phosphonated levan \n\n(Ph-levan), 4 g of levan was dissolved in 100 mL of pyridine by vigorously mixing on a magnetic stirrer \n\nfor 48 hours at ambient conditions and then the solution was cooled down to 0\u00baC. In an ice bath, 4 mL \n\nof phosphorus trichloride (PCl3) was added slowly in a drop-wise manner to the well-stirred solution. \n\nAfter stirring for 30 min under ambient conditions, 100 mL of saturated sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) \n\nwas added. The aqueous phase containing the modified polymer was separated and freed from pyridine, \n\nand then subjected to dialysis against distilled water for at least 4 consecutive days with frequent \n\nexchanges of the solvent (3\u20135 times per day). The polymer was freeze-dried and an overall recovery \n\nyield of about 50% was achieved. \n\n5.1.2 ELR expression and purification \n\nElastin-like recombinamers are genetically-engineered polypeptides that can exhibit precise amino acid \n\nlength and sequence, and stimuli-responsiveness toward external stimuli, such as temperature, pH, \n\nionic strength, and some toward light. An exhaustive description of elastin-like macromolecules has \n\nalready been provided in Section I, as Chapter 3. \n\nFrom Chapter 7 to Chapter 11, ELRs were used as one of the constituents of the multilayer films and \n\ncoatings. Expression conditions and purification protocols were adapted from Meyer and Chilkoti [15] \n\nand Girotti et al. [16]. ELRs were obtained by the induced gene expression from a stock of recombinant \n\nEscherichia coli strains containing the desired expressing gene. This stock of recombinant bacteria had \n\nbeen previously obtained. The artificial nature of ELRs means that it is necessary to design and \n\nsynthesize their genes de novo in order to obtain them. It is impossible to obtain a complete synthetic \n\ngene, through an approach involving genetic engineering. The repetitive structure of recombinamers \n\nimplies that a monomer deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) segment or \u201cmonomeric gene\u201d encoding a \n\nspecific polypeptide sequence can be created and subsequently seamlessly joined independently of the \n\npresence of restriction sites in the target DNA to generate multimerized genes that express the whole \n\nrecombinamer. Three strategies can be employed to obtain the polymeric genes. One is \n\nconcatemerization method, a random, directional concatenation of the monomeric gene. This method \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n177 \n\nallows multimeric genes with a defined distribution and discrete lengths to be obtained in a single \n\ncloning cycle. The other is the iterative-recursive method, which allows complete control of the size and \n\ndistribution of the individual blocks that play central roles in formation of the supramolecular structures. \n\nFinally, recursive directional ligation (RDL), an alternative method in which DNA segments with two \n\ndifferent restriction sites flanking the insert are joined in sequential steps, with the length of the ligated \n\nsegments growing geometrically in each step (Figure 5.3) [17]. \n\n \n\nTransformation\n\nRecombinant\n\nbacteria\n\nFermentation\n\n?\nF\n\nPurification\n\n \n\nFigure 5.3.

(F) Recombinant bacteria containing the \n\ndesired gene are submitted to fermentation and purified afterwards to extract the bioproduced polymer. \n\n \n\nNine distinct ELRs were produced, differing in their amino acid sequence, length and, in most cases, \n\nbioactivity.

This polypeptide was submitted further to a chemical modification to neutralize its three lysines (K), \n\nin order to use a neutral ELR in LbL formulations. For that, V84 was modified by amidation of the \n\n?-amine group of the biopolymer with pentynoic anhydride as an acylating agent. The reaction was \n\nperformed in trifluoroethanol (TFE) with 10 equivalents of pentynoic anhydride per ?-amine group and \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n179 \n\n1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDAC; 5 equivalents) as catalyst. Pentynoic anhydride \n\nwas synthesized previously from pentynoic acid in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of dichloromethane and diethyl \n\nether in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The reaction mixture was stirred for 3 days at room \n\ntemperature. After this time, the functionalized polymer was precipitated into increasing fractions of \n\ndiethyl ether and dried in a vacuum oven at room temperature for 24 h. Once dry, the modified V84 \n\nwas solubilized in cold water and the crude product purified by exhaustive dialysis against water, then \n\nfrozen and finally freeze-dried. \n\n5.1.3 Synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles \n\nFor the purpose of constructing LbL-based systems with magnetic response in Chapter 11, magnetic \n\nnanoparticles (MNPs) were first synthesized. MNPs are structures susceptible to magnetic fields, often \n\nused to enhance medical imaging diagnosis of soft tissues (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) and \n\ntemperature-mediated treatments such as hyperthermia and tissue ablation [19-21]. Their magnetic \n\nresponsiveness also allows spatial mobilization/immobilization dependent on the application of a \n\nmagnetic field on demand. In a typical synthesis of spherical iron oxide MNPs, 10 mL of a solution \n\ncontaining 1.2 g of iron(III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3?6H2O) and 0.6 g of iron(II) chloride tetrahydrate \n\n(FeCl2?4H2O) was added drop-wise to 25 mL of ammonium hydroxide solution (NH4OH, made of 33% \n\nammonia, NH3, in H2O) over 4 h under an inert nitrogen atmosphere. The products of the reaction \n\nwere collected by magnetic separation and washed three times with ethanol and water. The last \n\nwashing step was made with ethanol, after which the products were left to dry at room temperature. \n\n5.2 Characterization of the materials \n\nMany characterization techniques were specific for each of the materials used: CHI, Ph-levan, ELRs and \n\nMNPs. \n\n5.2.1 Degree of deacetylation of chitosan \n\nAfter the purification of CHI \u2013 which was recurrently used in every experimental work \u2013 it was necessary \n\nto determine the precise degree of deacetylation (DD) of the obtained stock. For that purpose, \n\nhydrogen-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (\n1\nH-NMR) spectra were recorded for a sample of purified CHI. \n\nNMR is a common technique used to determine the structure of unknown organic structures, by \n\napplying a nuclear magnetic resonance with respect to hydrogen-1 nuclei within the molecules of a \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n180 \n\nsubstance. Among other things, it allows determining the number of protons in a molecule, different \n\ntypes of hydrogen atoms (e.g., protons bonded to carbon atoms that are attached to different functional \n\ngroups), and the number of \u201cneighbor\u201d hydrogen atoms a proton has [22]. Thus, 10 mg of chitosan \n\nwas dissolved in 1 mL of deuterated water (D2O) and 20 \u00b5L of deuterated hydrochloric acid (DCl) to \n\nform a viscous solution. An aliquot of this solution was placed in a 5 mm NMR tube and the spectrum \n\nrecorded at 60\u00baC. The calculation of the DD, in percentage (%), was based on the report of Hirai, Odani \n\nand Nakajima [23] and is presented in equation 5.1: \n\n100\n\n6\n\n1\n3\n\n1\n\n1(%) ?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n??\n\nc\n\ne\n\nI\n\nI\n\nDD   (5.1) \n\nwhere Ie represents the integral intensity of the CH3 resonance band and Ic the integral intensity of the \n\nH2 to H6 resonance bands (Figure 5.4). \n\n \n\n1\n\n2\n3\n\n4\n5\n\n6\n\n \n\nFigure 5.4. Typical structure of the N -D-glucosamine monomer in chitosan molecules. Each distinct \n\nhydrogen atom is identified from 1 to 6. \n\n5.2.2 Phosphonate-levan modification assessment \n\nTo assess if the modification of levan into Ph-levan was successful in Chapter 6, two techniques were \n\nused: energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis, for the elemental analysis of phosphorous, and \n\nFourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, by comparing both modified and unmodified levan samples \n\nwithin wavelength values of 400\u20134000 cm\n-1\n\n. EDS is performed using a scanning electron microscope \n\n(SEM) which, besides the morphology and surface of a sample, allows determining its elemental \n\ncomposition. When the electron beam bombards a sample, X-rays are produced as a result of the \n\nionization of an atom by high-energy radiation. Consequently, an inner shell electron is removed. To \n\nreturn an ionized atom to its ground state, an electron from a higher energy outer shell fills the vacant \n\ninner shell and, in the process, releases an amount of energy equal to the potential energy difference \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n181 \n\nbetween the two shells. The excess energy is unique for every atomic transition and allows determining \n\nthe atomic element in analysis [24]. In FTIR, infrared radiation passes through a sample: some of this \n\nradiation is absorbed by the sample some of it is transmitted through. The detected infrared spectrum \n\nis the result of transitions between vibrational energy states, which can range from simple coupled \n\nmotion of two atoms in a diatomic molecule to a more complex atomic motion in a large polyfunctional \n\nmolecule. Thus, it is possible to detect functional groups, for instance, in a modified polymer by \n\nmeasuring characteristic absorption spectra, in respect to an unmodified sample [25]. \n\n5.2.3  Elastin-like recombinamers bioproduction assessment \n\nELRs used throughout Chapters 7 to 11 were characterized following a multitude of techniques. To \n\nassess that the desired ELR was appropriately synthesized and produced, amino acid composition \n\nanalysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy \n\nwere used. The amino acid composition was determined according to the AccQTag Waters method and \n\nthe derivatized amino acids analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In general, \n\nan ideal derivatizing reagent must consist of an appropriate reactive group and a strong fluorophore. \n\nTypically, the protocol of the manufacturer requires the use of 6-aminoquinolyl-N -hydroxysuccinimidyl \n\ncarbamate to react with primary and secondary amines to produce unsymmetrical urea derivatives that \n\nare highly fluorescent. Such conjugates can be separated in chromatographic columns and be detected \n\nsensitively using ultraviolet fluorescence detectors [26,27]. MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy was used to \n\ndetermine the molecular weight of the produced ELRs. In MALDI-TOF, proteins are liberated in an \n\nionized form from a target surface by firing a laser pulse at crystallized proteins. The ionized proteins \n\nare accelerated through a vacuum tube by an electrical field and reach a detector. Smaller proteins are \n\naccelerated to higher velocities than heavier proteins, and the \u201ctime-of-flight\u201d is proportional to \u201cm/z\u201d. \n\nThe charge \u201cz\u201d of ionized proteins is often 1, making the m/z value equal to the mass value [28]. \n\n5.2.4 Magnetization of MNPs \n\nMagnetic particles can be classified as ferromagnetic and paramagnetic/superparamagnetic. Whereas \n\nthe former exhibit a permanent magnetic dipole moment, with a paramagnetic particle a magnetic \n\ndipole moment is induced only when an external magnetic field is applied [29-32]. The magnetization of \n\nthe MNPs was therefore measured as a function of an applied external magnetic field. Typically, a \n\nvibrating sample magnetometer is used, which is capable of generating a magnetic field and detect the \n\nmagnetization exhibited by a tested material. \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n182 \n\nThe shape and morphology of the magnetite nanoparticles were determined using high resolution \n\ntransmission electronic microscope (TEM). TEM is a microscopy technique that detects a beam of \n\nelectrons transmitted through a specimen. A microscope of this class is capable of imaging at a \n\nsignificantly higher resolution than conventional light microscopes, thus it was appropriate to observe \n\nsuch nanometric structures [33]. The samples were prepared by dropping a dilute aqueous solution \n\n(1 mg?mL\n-1\n\n) of the nanoparticles onto a 200-mesh copper grid and allowing the solvent to evaporate. \n\n5.2.5 Measurement of charges \n\nThe charge exhibited by each polymer in aqueous solution was determined by the measurement of zeta \n\n(?)-potentials using laser Doppler electrophoresis. When a solid surface is in contact with an aqueous \n\nsolution, the formation of an interfacial charge causes a rearrangement of the local free ions in the \n\nsolution to produce a thin region of nonzero net charge density near the interface. The arrangement of \n\nthe charges at the solid-liquid interface and the balancing counter-ions in the liquid is usually referred to \n\nas the electrical double layer. This region consists in a thin layer of counter-ions immediately next to the \n\ncharged solid surface, called the compact layer, or Stern layer. The counter-ions in the compact layer \n\nare immobile due to the strong electrostatic attraction, while counter-ions outside the compact layer are \n\nmobile. This last part of the electrical double layer is called the diffuse layer. The ?-potential is the \n\nelectrostatic potential at the boundary dividing the compact layer and the diffuse layer [34]. This \n\npotential may depend on the polymer concentration, pH and ionic strength. Thus, solutions of each \n\npolymeric material were prepared considering one of two situations: (i) the conditions that would be \n\nused afterwards for the construction of the LbL films and coatings, in an attempt to relate both charge \n\nand successful or unsuccessful multilayer construction, or (ii) the conditions in which the developed \n\ncoatings are placed after their construction, to determine their behavior at, e.g., physiological conditions. \n\nAqueous solutions of each ingredient were tested all the times at 25\u00baC, 0.15 M of sodium chloride \n\n(NaCl), with varying concentrations and pH values. Regarding (i) they were: 1 mg?mL\n-1\n\n, pH 5.5 for \n\nPh-levan and CHI (Chapter 6); 100 ?g?mL\n-1\n\n, pH 5.5 for ELR-RGD (herein corresponding to 3K-VRGDV) \n\nand CHI (Chapter 8); 100 ?g?mL\n-1\n\n, pH 4.0 or 5.5 for all 9 ELRs, CHI and ALG (Chapter 7). Regarding \n\n(ii), they were: 300 ?g?mL\n-1\n\n, pH 7.4 for ELR-RGD and ELR-RDG\n(-)\n\n (herein corresponding to 3K-VRGDV \n\nand 3K-VRDG\n(-)\n\nV, respectively). \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n183 \n\n5.2.6 Temperature responsiveness of the polymers \n\nDifferential scanning microscopy (DSC) and dynamic laser scattering (DLS) were used to evaluate the \n\nstimuli-responsiveness. DSC was used in Chapter 8 to determine the transition temperature of a sample \n\nof 3K-VRGDV. This technique measures the change of the difference in the heat flow rate to a sample \n\nand to a reference sample while they are subjected to a controlled temperature program. It provides \n\ndirect, model-independent determinations of the transition properties, such as enthalpy, entropy, and \n\ntransition temperature, and is an appropriate technique to study the inverse temperature transition of \n\nELRs [35,36]. Experiments were performed with water solutions of 3K-VRGDV at 50 mg?mL\n-1\n\n were \n\nprepared at pH 7.4. In a typical DSC run, 20 ?L of the solution were placed inside a standard 40 ?L \n\naluminum pan hermetically sealed. The same volume of water was placed in the reference pan. All \n\nsamples were equilibrated for 5 minutes at 5\u00b0C inside the sample chamber just before the beginning of \n\neach experiment. A heating rate of 5\u00baC?min\n-1\n\n was used. \n\nDynamic laser scattering (DLS) consists in the emission of a laser light over particles, emulsions or \n\nmolecules dispersed or dissolved in a liquid. The interaction of this laser with the particles causes the \n\nlight to be scattered at different intensities. The light intensity measured at the other end of the \n\ndetectors in then interpreted and provides an estimation of the size of the samples dissolved or \n\ndispersed in solution [37]. It was used to determine the formation of polymeric aggregates in various \n\nsolutions at various temperatures. In Chapter 9, 3K-VRGDV aggregate sizes were measured in the \n\ntemperature range 25\u201337\u00b0C after stabilization for 5 minutes, to determine the transition temperature of \n\nthe polypeptide. Samples were prepared at 300 \u00b5g?mL\n-1\n\n in phosphate-buffered solution (PBS, pH 7.4). \n\nA total of 20 runs were performed for each sample to obtain a final average value at constant \n\ntemperature. In Chapter 11, the reversibility of the temperature-induced phase transition of the same \n\nELR-RGD was evaluated. For solutions prepared under the same conditions, measurements were \n\nperformed first at 25\u00baC, then 37 \u00baC and finally back at 25\u00baC. A total of 20 runs were performed for \n\neach sample to obtain an average value at stabilized temperature. In the same chapter, ALG and CHI \n\nwere also submitted to the same measurements, although CHI \u2013 due to this polybase\u2019s pKa \u2013 had to be \n\ntested at pH 5.5. Nonetheless, it was not expected that temperature influenced significantly the \n\nresponse of CHI, regardless of the pH value. \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n184 \n\n5.3 Assessment of LbL films\u2019 growth \n\n5.3.1 In situ monitoring \n\nIn order to determine if a set of ingredients can be used to construct multilayer films and coatings, a \n\nquartz-crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) was used in Chapters 6, 7 and 8, a \n\ntechnique that is able to detect adsorbed surface density changes in the order of ng.cm\n-2\n\n and measure \n\nthe viscoelastic properties of the resulting surface in real time. In this technique, a sensor is composed \n\nof a thin AT-cut quartz disk sandwiched between a pair of electrodes. Quartz allows exploiting the \n\npiezoelectric which makes it possible to convert an electric AC voltage across its electrodes into \n\nmechanical motion, exciting the quartz to oscillation at a fundamental frequency of 5 MHz. Therefore, \n\nthe use of quartz sensors for QCM requires the use of \u201cchips\u201d that are coated by the electrode material, \n\nwhich can be one of a number of metals but being gold the one mostly used. An AT-cut quartz crystal \n\ncan be excited at its fundamental frequency (5 MHz) and at several overtones: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13, \n\ncorresponding respectively to 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55 and 65 MHz, although different overtones can be \n\nmonitored, depending on the equipment\u2019s supplier. When a thin film is deposited onto the sensor \n\ncrystal the frequency decreases. If the film is thin and rigid, the decrease in frequency (?F) is \n\nproportional to the mass of the film. However, when using polymers, the adsorbed film is not rigid and \n\nthis relation is not valid. At the same time, monitoring of ?D gives an indirect indication of the film\u2019s \n\nviscoelastic properties. An increase in ?D represents a shift towards a film with a higher viscous \n\ncomponent and damping properties typical of \u201csoft\u201d polymeric LbL films. The dissipation values for a \n\nsoft film are higher due to increased energy loss from the crystal, whereas smaller dissipation values \n\nare obtained for a rigid film. It is this dampening to the crystal\u2019s oscillation that is registered as \n\ndissipation, ?D [38-42]. \n\nThe adsorption of polymeric layers was studied onto gold-coated quartz crystals in situ, cleaned with \n\nacetone, absolute ethanol and 2-propanol prior to the experiments. The quartz crystals were excited at \n\nmultiple overtones: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13. For all monitoring experiments, adsorption took place at \n\n25\u00baC, using solutions at 0.15 M NaCl. Each multilayer constituent was flushed sequentially to the inside \n\nof the chamber where the sensor was immobilized at a constant flow rate of 50 mL?min\n-1\n\n, being each \n\nadsorption step separated by a 10-minute intermediate rinsing step with 0.15 M NaCl, as depicted in \n\nFigure 5.5. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5.

Schematic representation of LbL adsorption on top of gold-coated quartz crystal sensors. \n\n \n\nThe adsorption time and polymer concentration varied for each experiment performed: 10 min, \n\n1 mg?mL\n-1\n\n for CHI (starting layer) and Ph-levan films (Chapter 6); 10 min, 100 ?g?mL\n-1\n\n for CHI \n\n(starting layer) and 3K-VRGDV films (Chapter 8); 15 min, 100 ?g?mL\n-1\n\n for CHI/ELR and ELR/ALG films \n\n(Chapter 7), being CHI and ALG always adsorbed first and second, respectively. Except for the latter \n\nchapter, the frequency of each overtone was normalized to the fundamental resonant frequency of the \n\nquartz crystal, by dividing it by ? (where ? is the number of the overtone). In the specific case of \n\nChapter 7 \u2013 Appendix, CHI/monoblock and CHI/triblock films (herein designated as HAP3 and \n\nH3A20H3, respectively) were assembled at a pH value of 4.5, with the rest of the solution parameters \n\nbeing similar to the ones in the main chapter. \n\n5.3.2 Estimation of films\u2019 thicknesses \n\nThe Voigt-based viscoelastic model was used to estimate the thickness of the films from the QCM-D \n\nmonitoring data. The obtained frequency and dissipation values were converted to their estimated \n\nthickness using the Voigt-based viscoelastic model [43], which is integrated into the QTools software \n\nfrom Q-Sense (supplier of the equipment), based on equations 5.2 and 5.3: \n\n?\n??\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n???? ?\n?\n\n222\n\n22\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n00\n\n2\n2\n\n1\n\njj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nkj\n\njj\nhh\n\nh\nF\n\n???\n\n??\n\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n?\n\n?\n\n??\n (5.2) \n\n??\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?? ?\n?kj jj\n\nj\n\nj\nh\n\nhf\nD\n\n222\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n00\n\n2\n2\n\n1\n\n???\n\n??\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n??\n (5.3) \n\nwhere, considering a total of k thin viscoelastic layers, ?0 and h0 are the density and thickness of the \n\nquartz crystal, ?3 is the viscosity of the bulk liquid, ?3 is the viscous penetration depth of the shear wave \n\nin the bulk liquid, ?3 is the density of liquid, ? is the elastic shear modulus of an overlayer and ? is the \n\nangular frequency of the oscillation. \n\nIterations of the model were performed using at least three overtones. The model requires three \n\nparameters, namely solvent density, solvent viscosity and film density, to be fixed. The solvent viscosity \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n186 \n\nwas therefore fixed at 0.001 Pa?s (same as water) and the film density at 1200 kg.m\n-3\n\n (often assumed \n\nto return the lowest calculation error) [44-46]. The solvent density was varied by trial and error until the \n\ntotal error, ?\n2\n, was minimized. The solvent density values that allowed obtaining the minimum error was \n\ndetermined to be within 1000\u20131015 kg?m\n-3\n\n for levan-based films (Chapter 6) and 1000\u20131060 kg?m\n-3\n\n \n\nfor ELR-based films (Chapters 7 and 8). The area density, a rough approximation of the mass adsorbed \n\non top of a gold-coated quartz sensor was calculated by multiplying the thickness by the films density \n\n(1200 kg.m\n-3\n\n). \n\n5.4 Assembly and characterization of multilayer films \n\n5.4.1 In planar substrates \n\nAfter determining if a set of constituents provided a favorable multilayer construction, they were \n\nreproduced outside of the QCM-D. Hybrid multilayer films based on the diverse polymeric materials \n\nused herein were constructed by dipping alternately glass substrates into the polyelectrolyte solutions \n\nfor 10 min, with an intermediate rinsing step of 5 (Chapter 6) or 10 min (Chapter 7 - Appendix and \n\nChapter 8) in NaCl 0.15 M. In similarity to most metallic alloys, glass is negatively charged, and thus \n\nprovided support for the formation of a multilayer coating by adsorbing CHI as a polycation primer \n\nlayer [47]. \n\nIn Chapter 6, fresh CHI and Ph-levan polyelectrolyte solutions were prepared (1 mg?mL\n-1\n\n, 0.15 M NaCl, \n\npH 5.5). Commercial glass from a local store were acquired and cut into 100\u00d720 mm\n2\n slides and \n\ncleaned thoroughly by immersion in a sequence of absolute ethanol, 2-propanol and chromosulfuric \n\nacid for 24 h. The construction was assisted by an in-house developed dipping robot that allowed the \n\nautomated assembly of each layer in a programmed manner. The construction proceeded until 100 \n\nlayers (50 bilayers) were adsorbed. Films consisting of CHI and ALG were produced in parallel under \n\nthe same experimental conditions for control purposes. In Chapter 7 \u2013 Appendix, films of CHI and \n\neither HAP3 or H3A20H3 were assembled onto glass pieces (1 cm\n2\n). The number of CHI/HAP3 and \n\nCHI/ H3A20H3 bilayers assembled was defined based on the results from the QCM-D screening stage. \n\nIn Chapter 8, five pairs of CHI and ELR-RGD were prepared by manual dipping at the surface of regular \n\nglass microscopy slides cut into 1 cm\n2\n pieces after undergoing a cleaning stage with acetone, absolute \n\nethanol and 2-propanol.  \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n187 \n\n5.4.1.1 Adhesiveness of the films \n\nIn Chapter 6, the adhesiveness of \u201cPh-levan\u201d-based films was studied by measuring the lap shear \n\nadhesive strength between two individual films. This technique determines the force that causes an \n\nadhesive to slide on a surface in the direction parallel to the plan of contact [48], as depicted in Figure \n\n5.6. \n\n \n\nF F\n\noverlapped\n\narea\n\ndisplaced\n\narea\n\n \n\nFigure 5.6. Experimental setup for the measurement of the lap shear adhesive strength. \n\n \n\nAs soon as the construction of the films was concluded, two coated glass slides were put in contact \n\nface-to-face with an overlapping area of 20\u00d710 mm\n2\n. To promote better adhesion, a weight of 6 kg was \n\napplied perpendicularly to the joint area and after a curing time of 24 h, the weight was removed. The \n\nbonded glass slides were placed in a universal mechanical testing machine according to the ASTM \n\nD1002-05 standard method and fixed by one binder grip in each extremity. A crosshead speed of \n\n5 mm?min\n-1\n\n was employed and the samples were stressed until enough force was applied to trigger \n\ntheir detachment and pull them apart. The same setup was used to evaluate the adhesiveness of \n\nCHI/ALG films for the purpose of comparison. The lap shear bonding strength was then determined \n\nfrom the maximum of the force-deformation curve obtained. The average and standard deviations were \n\ndetermined using the results from five bonded substrates. Values reported reflect means\u00b1standard \n\ndeviation (SD) of three independent experiments, and analyzed using t-student test. All results were \n\nconsidered to be statistically significant at p-value less than 0.05. \n\n5.4.1.2 Contact angle measurements \n\nThe wettability of a surface can be quantified by the measurement of contact angles. The contact angle \n\nof a liquid drop on a solid surface is the angle at which a liquid/vapor interface meets a solid surface. It \n\nis defined by the mechanical equilibrium of the drop under the action of three interfacial tensions and \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n188 \n\nallows quantifying the wettability of a solid surface by a liquid via the Young equation. Surfaces with high \n\nenergy typically exhibit a low contact angle, whereas hydrophobic surfaces exhibit low surface \n\nenergy [49].   \n\nIn Chapter 7 \u2013 Appendix, PBS-contact angles were measured for coatings of CHI/HAP3 and \n\nCHI/H3A20H3 at 4 and 50\u00baC. The number of layers was defined based on the results from the QCM-D. \n\nThe coatings were immersed in PBS placed under each temperature condition. After periods of 10 min \n\nof immersion in each temperature condition, the samples were withdrawn and contact angles were \n\nmeasured. If wettability did not change significantly, the samples were placed in immersion for an \n\nadditional period of 10 min at the same temperature. \n\nIn Chapter 8, coatings up to 10 layers \u2013 5 pairs of CHI and 3K-VRGDV \u2013 were characterized for their \n\nwettability for each layer assembled using the sessile drop method, at 37\u00baC and pH 7.4. These \n\nmeasurement conditions were chosen to simulate the behavior of the films under physiological \n\nconditions of temperature and pH for each assembled pH. An approach described by Park et al. [50] \n\nwas used to measure contact angles dependent on several temperature, pH and ionic strength \n\nconditions: the samples were immersed in a beaker of PBS placed under each condition. After 1 hour, \n\nthe samples were withdrawn and contact angles were measured (Figure 5.7). The time of 1 h was \n\ndetermined to be enough to have a stable surface. Therefore, measurements were performed for a pH \n\nrange from 4 to 12, ionic strength from 0 to 1.5 M of NaCl, and three relevant temperatures: 25, 37 \n\nand 50\u00baC. Upon determining the wettability transition parameters, three cycles were performed by \n\nchanging the transition values above and below each transition value. \n\n \n\nSample immersed in PBS\n\nAfter a time \u201ct\u201d\n\n \n\nFigure 5.7. Schematics of contact angle measurements. The dotted surface symbolizes a modified \n\nglass substrate. \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n189 \n\n5.4.1.3 Surface topography \n\nAtomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed in LbL-coated glass slides cut into \n\npieces of 1\u00d71 cm\n2\n, in Chapter 7 \u2013 Appendix and Chapter 8, following a similar protocol to that of \n\ncontact angle measurements, in both cases scanning an area of 1\u00d71 \u00b5m\n2\n. This technique is a \n\nsynthesis of the mechanical profilometer, using mechanical springs to sense forces, and the scanning \n\ntunneling microscopy (STM), using piezoelectric transducers for scanning. In force microscopy, a \n\nprobing tip is attached to a cantilever-type spring. In response to the force between tip and sample, the \n\ncantilever is deflected. This deflection is then translated into a visual image [51]. \n\nIn Chapter 8, 5 pairs of CHI/3K-VRGDV were immersed in PBS for 30 min. To assess the influence of \n\npH in the coatings, the samples were immersed in PBS at two pH values: 7.4 and 11. To avoid the \n\nformation of crystals during the acquisition, the samples were immersed shortly in ultrapure water for \n\nremoving excess of saline solution. The samples were then retrieved and introduced in the device. \n\nValues reported reflect means\u00b1standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments, and analyzed \n\nusing t-student test. All results were considered to be statistically significant at p-value less than 0.05. \n\nIn Chapter 7 \u2013 Appendix, CHI/monoblock and CHI/triblock samples were immersed in PBS at room \n\ntemperature and 50\u00baC and then retrieved and introduced in the device. \u201cpH\u201d was also analyzed, for \n\nvalues of 7.4 and 12. \n\nWhen a multilayer film is rough, viscous and/or thick, AFM may not be appropriate technique to scan \n\nits topography. In these cases, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) \u2013 a technique that allows observing \n\nthe surface of an object by bombarding it with an electron beam \u2013 presents itself as a viable alternative. \n\nSEM was used in Chapter 6 to evaluate the topography of CHI/Ph-levan and CHI/ALG films. The \n\nsurfaces to be observed were left to dry overnight at room temperature and sputtered with gold prior to \n\nSEM observations. \n\n5.4.2 In three dimensional substrates \n\n5.4.2.1 Preparation of spherical microparticle templates \n\nMultilayer combinations made of CHI and 3K-VRGDV were extrapolated to the third dimension in the \n\nform of capsules. For this purpose, microparticles of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) served as spherical \n\ntemplates, which are easily obtained and provide a very simple three-dimensional structure to perform \n\nLbL. Microcapsules made of these constituents were constructed in Chapters 9, 10 and 11. Prior to the \n\nshell assembly, the template microparticles were produced. Typically, aqueous solutions of sodium \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n190 \n\ncarbonate (Na2CO3) and calcium chloride (CaCl2) were prepared at 1 M. Co-precipitation of both \n\nsolutions was performed by adding a volume \u201cV\u201d of Na2CO3 followed by a volume \u201cV\u201d of CaCl2 to a \n\nvariable volume of a precipitation medium/bath under rapid stirring for 30 seconds. The volume of the \n\nprecipitation medium was of \u201c2V\u201d (Chapters 9 and 11) or \u201c4V\u201d (Chapter 10). Stirring was then stopped \n\nand the suspension of newly synthesized CaCO3 microparticles left to react and precipitate for 15 min. \n\nThe supernatant was then removed and the particles washed twice or three times with ultrapure water \n\nto remove residual salts. \n\nThe co-precipitation could occur in a precipitation medium that, besides water, contains an agent for \n\nencapsulation. The encapsulation is achieved due to the physical entrapment of such agent in the newly \n\nformed solid microparticles. In Chapter 9, a the entrapment of a \u201cfluorescein isothiocyanate\u201d-tagged \n\nbovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA) entrapment was achieved following the method described by \n\nShe et al. [52], by preparing a precipitation medium with a FITC-BSA concentration of 5 mg?mL-1. In \n\nthis work, SEM was used to evaluate the morphology of the sacrificial templates. Specimens were pre-\n\ncoated with a conductive layer of sputtered gold and micrographs recorded at 10 kV. In Chapter 10, \n\nDQ-ovalbumin was entrapped from a medium at 160 ?g?mL\n-1\n\n. DQ-ovalbumin is a protein chemically \n\nsaturated with BODIPY dyes. The close proximity of the dye molecules causes a self-quenching \n\nmechanism characterized by the exhibition of red fluorescence. However, upon enzymatic degradation, \n\ntheir proximity is revoked and dye-labeled peptide fragments are released, exhibiting a fluorescence shift \n\nfrom red to green [53]. It is therefore an excellent agent that can be used to follow cellular uptake and \n\nintracellular traffic by monitoring the changes in the fluorescence emitted. Finally, in Chapter 11, a \n\nprecipitation medium containing either rhodamine-B isothiocyanate or MNPs was prepared at \n\n500 ?g?mL\n-1\n\n using the same method. \n\n5.4.2.2 Construction of the multilayer shells \n\nThe templates \u2013 either doped or empty \u2013 were immersed alternately in CHI and 3K-VRGDV solutions \n\n(300 \u00b5g?mL\n-1\n\n, pH 5.5, 0.15 M of NaCl) for 10 min each, then washed with 0.15 M NaCl (pH 5.5). \n\nCentrifugation was avoided to avoid damage and aggregation of the particles each time the samples \n\nwere to be retrieved from solution; simple precipitation of the suspension was used instead (3 to 5 min). \n\nIn Chapter 10, where the internalization by cells was to be studied, each adsorption step was followed \n\nby three washing steps with 0.15 M NaCl, pH 5.5, with the first being accompanied by 4 sequential \n\nultra-sound pulses of 3 seconds each to disaggregate the substrates. This extra step was performed in \n\norder to ensure a more thorough washing, microcapsule separation and therefore avoiding major \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n191 \n\nbiological shock due to undesired residues and aggregation. This construction process was repeated to \n\nincrease the number of bilayers until the desired coating had been obtained. In Chapter 9, the effect of \n\nthe number of layers in the multilayer shell permeability was object of study, thus samples with 1, 3 \n\nand 5 bilayers were constructed. In Chapters 10 and 11, the coatings were constructed with 2 and 3 \n\nbilayers, respectively. After construction, three approaches were followed: (i) in Chapter 9, the CaCO3 \n\ncore was immediately dissolved with ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA, 0.2 M, pH 5.5), which is a \n\nknown chelating agent of metal ions, like calcium ions, and washed twice PBS; (ii) in Chapter 10, the \n\nmicrocapsules followed a washing procedure with EDTA (0.2 M, pH 7.4) and four with ultrapure water, \n\nwith centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 25 min in between and ultrasound pulses timed as described above. \n\nAlthough centrifugation should ideally be avoided, the extra washing steps to which the microcapsules \n\nwere submitted could lead to increased losses in microcapsules\u2019 number. In the case of microcapsules \n\nintended for cellular contact rather than microscopic observations, Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium \n\n(DMEM) was used for the washings instead of water. The result is a batch of hollow multilayer shells \n\nentrapping a desired agent inside. A schematic of this procedure can be found in Figure 5.8; (iii) in \n\nChapter 11, the coated particles were left intact for the time being to be employed further in the \n\nconstruction of compartmentalized devices. \n\n5.4.2.3 Compartmentalized structures \n\nFollowing point (iii) of the previous paragraph, in Chapter 11 a 1% (w/v) solution of ALG was prepared. \n\nIn a typical experiment, the (CHI/3K-VRGDV)3-coated microparticles were suspended in 1 mL of ALG \n\nsolution and the resulting suspension extruded through a 25G needle, at a rate of 0.33 mL?min\n-1\n\n, into a \n\n0.75% (w/v) solution of CaCl2 under mild stirring. ALG beads containing coated microparticles were \n\nformed by calcium-mediated ionic gelation of alginate (Figure 5.9). The beads were coated with a \n\nChi/ALG multilayer shell. They were immersed alternately in CHI and ALG solutions (300 \u00b5g?mL\n-1\n\n, pH \n\n5.5, 0.15 M NaCl) for 10 min each, then washed with 0.15 M NaCl (pH 5.5 at 0.15 M) and this \n\nprocess was repeated until three bilayers were assembled, (CHI/ALG)3. After the coating was \n\nassembled, the beads were immersed in EDTA. At this point, the CaCO3 sacrificial templates were \n\nchelated simultaneously with the liquefied alginate bead. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5.

Rhodamine was suspended alongside \n\nmicrocapsules without any content and encapsulated in the ALG bead compartment instead of in the \n\ninner microcapsules. The mass of encapsulated rhodamine at this stage was determined by first \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n193 \n\ncalculating the construction losses resulting from the rhodamine-loaded microcapsules within the \n\nexternal alginate macrocapsule. \n\n5.4.2.4 Encapsulation losses and pre-loading efficiency \n\nIt should be noted that for drug delivery studies in Chapters 9 and 11, described below, all \n\nsupernatants were collected during the diverse construction stages of the multilayer microcapsules, \n\nfrom the synthesis of the sacrificial templates to the chelation stage. This was necessary in order to \n\ncalculate the BSA or rhodamine losses during each construction stage and determine the pre-loading \n\nefficiency. 150 ?L of sample was pipetted into a white, opaque 96-well plate in triplicate. Distilled water \n\nwas used as blank. The excitation (?exc) and emission (?em) wavelengths used for the calibration curve \n\nand FITC-BSA mass calculations were 485 and 528 nm, respectively. All supernatants collected during \n\nentrapment, construction and chelation were measured and quantified. The percentage of FITC-BSA \n\nmass lost was plotted both for each stage and cumulatively. The encapsulation efficiency was \n\ncalculated by subtracting the cumulative losses of each architecture (i.e., microcapsules with distinct \n\nnumber of layers) from the initial FITC-BSA mass. A similar approach was followed for rhodamine, for \n\nwhich the excitation (?exc) and emission (?em) wavelengths were 530 and 590 nm, respectively. \n\n5.4.2.5 Microscopy evaluation of the structures \n\nConfocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to evaluate the structure of the produced \n\ncapsular microstructures. This is a technique that allows observing optical and fluorescence images \n\nwith depth sensitivity, i.e., a sample can be scanned plane-by-plane in the z-axis. CHI/3K-VRGDV shells \n\nwith 5 layers capped with a final layer of rhodamine B (assembled from a solution at 10\n-6\n\n M) and \n\nencapsulating FITC-BSA (Chapter 9) or 3 layers encapsulating FITC (Chapter 11) were produced. In the \n\nfirst case, in the intent of evaluating morphological changes dependent on temperature, all samples \n\nwere stabilized at either 25 or 37\u00baC and observed under hydrated conditions. In the second case, \n\nsamples were observed only at 25\u00baC. \n\nThe morphology of the produced microcapsules in Chapter 10 consisting in 2 bilayers of \n\nCHI/3K-VRGDV or CHI/3K-VRDG\n(-)\n\nV was determined using an environmental scanning electron \n\nmicroscopy (ESEM). With this technique, it is possible to observe a sample without a coating of \n\nsputtered gold.  A number of 2.2\u00d710\n4\n microcapsules suspended in 200 ?L of H2O was placed on top \n\nof a silicon wafer (1 cm\n2\n) and dried overnight at 37\u00baC before the analysis. The samples were placed \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n194 \n\ninside the equipment in a platform with a 20\u00ba tilt. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to \n\nobtain images of the multilayer coating. Prior to the observation, a number of 10\n4\n microcapsules \n\nsuspended in 60 ?L of H2O was pipetted onto a TEM grid and left to dry overnight at room temperature. \n\nTEM was also used in Chapter 11 to determine the distribution of MNPs within the microcapsules. Prior \n\nto the observation, a volume of 60 ?L of microcapsule suspension was pipetted onto a TEM grid and \n\nleft to evaporate overnight. Both MNP-loaded and empty microcapsules were observed. Fluorescence \n\nmicroscopy was used to evaluate the morphology of the coated liquefied ALG beads. In contrast to \n\nCLSM, this technique scans the fluorescence exhibited by the surface. If translucid, the interior can also \n\nbe observed. Based on this consideration, (CHI/ALG)3-coated liquefied beads were observed using \n\ntransmitted light and fluorescence microscopy for rhodamine-loaded external compartments. The latter \n\nalso containing FITC-loaded microcapsules were observed to assess the distribution of the \n\nsubcompartments within the macrocapsules. \n\n5.5 In vitro release studies from three-dimensional capsules \n\nThe microcapsules in Chapter 9 were resuspended in PBS at either 25 or 37\u00b0C. The upper limit of five \n\nbilayers for the microcapsule architecture was chosen to study the effect of temperature along with \n\nsmall changes in the number of different layers. This study was conducted over 14 days, removing the \n\nsurrounding PBS from each container every 24 h. An additional sample was taken after 12 h from the \n\nstart of the study. PBS was fully refreshed at each time point, and 100% FITC-BSA was considered to be \n\nthe total mass remaining in the microcapsules after their construction. The release experiments were \n\nperformed under mild agitation to improve the diffusion of FITC-BSA through the incubating medium. All \n\nexperiments were performed in triplicate (n=3), with each sample containing the number of capsules \n\nresulting from the attempted encapsulation of 1 mg of BSA. To determine the type of release profile for \n\neach condition, the release kinetics were determined using the Korsmeyer kinetic model (equation 5.4): \n\nn\nKt/M\n\nt\nM ?\n\n?\n (5.4) \n\nwhere Mt /M? is the fraction of protein released at time t, K is the rate constant for the Korsmeyer \n\nmodel, and n is the exponent that characterizes the release mechanism [54]. The Korsmeyer model is \n\nused when the release mechanism from a swellable polymeric device is not well-known or when more \n\nthan one type of release phenomenon could be involved. The latter was a possibility since the phase \n\ntransition of these ELRs is a complex phenomenon, allied to a similarly complex hybrid and three-\n\ndimensional shell. The fitting was performed for all architectures and for each temperature. As a means \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n195 \n\nof comparison, fitting with other models was also made: zero-order (equation 5.5), first-order (equation \n\n5.6) and Higuchi (equation 5.7): \n\ntKQQ\nt 00\n\n??  (5.5) \n\nwhere Qt is the cumulative amount of protein released at time t, Q0 is the initial amount of protein and \n\nK0 is the rate constant for the zero-order model; \n\n303.2/)()(\n0\n\nKtQLogQLog\nt\n\n??  (5.6) \n\nwhere Qt is the cumulative amount of protein released at time t, Q0 is the initial amount of protein and \n\nK is the rate constant for the first-order model; \n\n2/1\ntKQ\n\nH\n?  (5.7) \n\nwhere Q is the cumulative amount of protein released at time t and KH is the rate constant for the \n\nHiguchi model. \n\nThe compartmentalized systems from Chapter 11 were suspended in PBS at either 25 or 37\u00baC, with \n\nrhodamine being encapsulated in one of two hierarchical locations: the internal (CHI/3K-VRGDV)3 \n\nmicrocapsules (with rhodamine added during the co-precipitation stage) or the external liquefied \n\nalginate (CHI/ALG)3-coated macrocapsules (with rhodamine added to the initial alginate solution). The \n\nstudy was conducted for 2 h to assess the early release profile in 3 mL of PBS, with 600 ?L of \n\nsurrounding PBS being removed every 10 min and the container being refilled with the same volume of \n\nPBS pre-stabilized at the corresponding temperature. 100% of Rhod was considered to be the total \n\nmass remaining in the compartmental systems after taking construction losses into account. The \n\nstudies were performed three times (n=3). \n\n5.6 Mechanical resistance of compartmental units \n\nA centrifugal rotation test was performed with the samples suspended in PBS to measure the \n\nmechanical resistance of the (CHI/ALG)3 macrocapsules (Chapter 11). 100 samples were placed in \n\ncentrifuge tubes and rotated at a starting centrifugal load of 500g. After 5 min, the number of intact \n\nbeads was counted. Those that remained intact were submitted to incremental centrifugal loads (500g \n\nincremental steps) up to a maximum of 5000g. This experiment was performed three times. \n\n5.7 Magnetic responsiveness assays \n\nMacrocapsules containing MNP-loaded microcapsules were suspended in a PBS-filled square \n\npolystyrene Petri dish placed upon a 1\u00d71 cm\n2\n grid (Chapter 11).

Materials and methods \n\n \n\n196 \n\n(NdFeB) bar magnet (diameter: 4 mm; length: 2.5 cm) was used to apply the external magnetic field. \n\nTen samples were placed 3 cm away from the magnet, with the latter placed at a height of 1.4 cm from \n\nthe PBS surface. The movement was recorded on video and the mean normalized distance traversed by \n\nthe samples plotted as a function of time. \n\n5.8 In vitro biological studies \n\n5.8.1 Cell seeding \n\nThe biological response of cells to biomaterials in vitro is critical to estimate if a harmful reaction is \n\ntriggered upon contact of a newly developed system with a living organism, common when biomedical \n\napplications are envisaged. Herein, cells were either seeded onto a substrate modified with multilayers, \n\nor seeded first onto a cell culture support and incubated in the presence of microcapsules in \n\nsuspension in the culture medium. \n\nIn Chapter 6, L929 cells \u2013 a murine fibroblast cell line \u2013 were routinely cultured with DMEM \n\nsupplemented with 3.7 g?L\n-1\n\n sodium bicarbonate, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% \n\npenicillin-streptomycin at pH 7.4. Cells were grown in 75 cm\n2\n tissue culture flasks and incubated at \n\n37\u00baC in a humidified air atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide (CO2). Every 3\u20134 days fresh medium was \n\nadded. At 90% of confluence, L929 cells were washed with PBS and subsequently detached by \n\ntrypsin-EDTA at 37\u00baC. To inactivate the trypsin effect, cell culture medium was added. Cells were then \n\ncentrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes and the medium was decanted. A 50 \u00b5L cell suspension with 2\u00d710\n4\n \n\ncells was added to glass slides with 1\u00d71 cm\n2\n modified with 50 (CHI/Ph-levan) or 50 (CHI/ALG) bilayers \n\n(in triplicate), previously sterilized by ultraviolet (UV)-radiation for 30 min. Surfaces were then incubated \n\nat 37\u00baC in a humidified air atmosphere of 5% CO2 and after 4 h culture medium was added. The \n\nexperiment was maintained for 24 h, after which the cellular adhesion was quantified. \n\nIn Chapter 8, cell adhesion was studied using SaOs-2 cells \u2013 a human osteosarcoma cell line \u2013 \n\nenvisaging the use of these coatings in orthopedic applications in order to improve host integration. Cell \n\nstudies were performed onto coatings of 5 pairs of layers, ending in 3K-VRGDV, CHI or 3K-VRGD\n(-)\n\nV \n\n(negative control), assembled at the surface of glass coverslips with 1 cm in diameter. Tissue culture \n\npolystyrene (TCPS) was used as a positive control. Cell adhesion was studied using the SaOs-2 \n\nosteoblast-like osteosarcoma cell line. Cells were seeded on the surfaces (5\u00d710\n4\n cell?mL\n\n-1\n) and \n\nincubated in serum free Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM), loaded with 1% \n\nantibiotics/antimicotics at 37\u00baC, 5% CO2. The substrates were analyzed at different time points: 4 h, 24 \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n197 \n\nh and 3 days. At each time point, cells on the coated surfaces were washed with PBS twice and fixed in \n\nformalin (3.7%). \n\nIn Chapter 9, L929 cells were used for the biological assays. They were cultured in DMEM with phenol \n\nred supplemented with 10% of FBS and 1% antibiotic/antimicotic in a humidified atmosphere with 5% \n\nCO2 at 37\u00b0C. For the cell viability test, 2\u00d710\n3\n cells were seeded on 48-well plates and incubated at \n\n37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. After 24 hours, microcapsules were added to the culture medium in a ratio of 40 \n\nmicrocapsules per cell. The incubation was maintained for 24 h, 3 days, and 7 days. \n\nIn Chapter 10, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were used for the purpose of evaluation the \n\ncellular uptake of CHI/ELR microcapsules. Mesenchymal stem cells are hypoimmunogenic and \n\npluripotent able to differentiate in in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo, into multiple cells types such as \n\nosteocytes, adipocytes, chondrocytes, neurocytes, hepatocytes, myocytes, and hematopoietic-\n\nsupporting stroma. The option to use hMSCs in this work a model of internalization of CHI/ELR \n\nmicrocapsules have the potential to be applied in transplantation, local implantation, gene therapy, drug \n\ndelivery and stem cell differentiation [55,56]. \u201chMSCs\u201d were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% \n\nFBS and 100 U?mL\n-1\n\n penicillin, 0.1 mg?mL\n-1\n\n streptomycin replaced every two days and maintained at \n\n37\u00baC in a 5% CO2 humidified environmental chamber. Near-confluence cells (passages 2\u20136) were \n\nharvested after enzymatically treatment with trypsin/EDTA or Accutase\nTM\n\n and suspended in culture \n\nmedium. Cell counts were evaluated using a standard Trypan Blue exclusion assay and seeded at \n\n3\u00d710\n3\n\n cell?cm\n-2\n\n on numerous circular cover glasses (diameter: 10 mm) and then incubated during 24 \n\nhours in standard conditions. Afterwards, the culture medium was refreshed by serum-free medium \n\ncontaining CHI/ELR microcapsules, either functionalized with 3K-VRGDV or 3K-VRDG\n(-)\n\nV. After 3 h of \n\nCHI/ELR microcapsules co-incubation, the cultures were maintained for longer times (3 days and 10 \n\ndays), by supplementing the microcapsule suspension with additional fresh medium to reach the final \n\nserum concentration of 2% FBS. \n\n5.8.2 Staining of cells adhered to bidimensional surfaces \n\nIn Chapters 6, 8 and 9, the cells adhered to the respective films were prepared for 4',6 diamidino-2-\n\nphenylindol (DAPI) staining. DAPI stains preferentially double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). \n\nDNA-DAPI complexes emit strong blue fluorescence when excited by ultraviolet light so that even very \n\nsmall amounts of DNA [57]. After each cell culture time-point, the films seeded with L929 cells were \n\nprepared for DAPI fluorescence assay. Briefly, samples were washed with PBS and formalin (3.7\u201310% \n\nconcentration range) was added to each well. After 15\u201330 min at 4\u00baC, formalin was removed and \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n198 \n\nsamples were washed with PBS. Then, a solution of PBS containing DAPI (1:1000) was added to each \n\nwell and let to react for 5 min at room temperature and protected from light. Ultimately, samples were \n\nwashed with PBS and visualized in the dark by fluorescence microscopy. For the specific case of \n\nChapter 6, the nuclei were counted to quantify L929 cells adhered to CHI/Ph-levan and CHI/ALG films: \n\nadhered cells were assessed by analyzing fluorescence pictures in triplicate using the software ImageJ \n\n(provided by NIH). Values reported reflect means\u00b1standard deviation (SD) of three independent \n\nexperiments, and analyzed using t-student test. All results were considered to be statistically significant \n\nat p-value less than 0.05. \n\nAdditionally, SaOs-2 (Chapter 8) and L929 (Chapter 9) cells were also stained with \n\n(tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate)-phalloidin (TRITC-phalloidin). Phalloidin binds tightly to \n\npolymerized actin filaments and, when conjugated with a fluorophore (like rhodamine), they can be \n\nobserved under fluorescence microscopy [58]. After fixation, cells were incubated with TRITC-phalloidin \n\n(10 ?g?mL\n-1\n\n) for 45 min and washed three times with PBS. Cells were observed under fluorescence \n\nmicroscopy. \n\n5.8.3 Cellular uptake of three dimensional microcapsules \n\nFor the assays regarding the internalization of microcapsules in Chapter 10, hMSCs were seeded onto \n\ndeposited in a 48-well plate and incubated during 24 h in standard conditions. (CHI/3K-VRGDV)2 and \n\n(CHI/3K-VRDG\n(-)\n\nV)2 microcapsules pre-loaded with DQ-ovalbumin were added to the culture. After 3 or \n\n72 h of incubation, samples were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) three \n\ntimes. Samples for microscopy analysis \u2013 confocal, phase-contrast, epifluorescence, and differential \n\ninterference contrast (DIC) microscopy \u2013 were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized \n\nwith 0.2% Triton X-100, and stained with DAPI following a similar protocol as described above. A \n\nconfocal microscope was used for analyzing microcapsules inside the cells. Z-series were performed \n\nwith a Z-step of 1 \u00b5m. The images of each fluorophore and phase contrast were overlaid to obtain a \n\nmultilayer image using ImageJ software. Bright field and fluorescence microscopy were performed \n\nusing blue, green and red fluorescence filters in order to determine the distribution and intracellular \n\ndegradation of each multilayer microcapsule type. \n\nTo quantify microcapsule internalization, 1.5\u00d710\n5\n hMSCs were seeded in a 25 cm\n\n2\n flasks and cultured \n\nas described above. (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 and (CHI/ELR-RDG\n(-)\n\n)2 microcapsules were added at a \n\nmicrocapsule-to-cell ratio of 10:1 and incubated during 72 h. The cell cultures dissociated by \n\nAccutase\nTM\n\n treatment \u2013 specially developed for gentle and effective cell dissociation \u2013 were washed, \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n199 \n\ncounted, suspended in DPBS, 25 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 5% \n\nFBS and analyzed in a flow cytometer. Flow cytometry is a technique for making rapid measurements \n\non particles or cells as they flow in a fluid stream through a sensing point one by one. It is routinely \n\nemployed in cell counting, cell sorting, biomarker detection and protein engineering [59]. The assay \n\nwas repeated three times. Values reported reflect means\u00b1standard error (SE) of three independent \n\nexperiments. The influence of microcapsules/cell ratio on cell viability was analyzed using one-way \n\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA) and the post test of Bonferroni, considered to be statistically significant at \n\np-value less than 0.05. All data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism. \n\n5.8.4 Cell metabolism and viability \n\nIn Chapter 8, to access cell viability, (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-\n\nsulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) (MTS) assay was performed. MTS and other tetrazolium dyes are \n\nbioreduced in cells by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, in its reduced form (NADH), in the cytosolic \n\ncompartment. This reduced product can be detected for by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm, and \n\nis therefore directly proportional to the number of living cells in the substrates [60]. After each culturing \n\nperiod, samples were washed twice with PBS. A 250 ?L aliquot of FBS-free culture medium and 50 ?L \n\nof MTS reagent were added to each well. A cell-free well was used as control. Plates were incubated for \n\n3 h at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, protected from light. After incubation, 100 ?L of this solution was transferred to a \n\n96-well plate and the plate read using a microplate reader in 490 nm absorbance mode. In Chapter 9, \n\nfor the cell viability test, 2\u00d710\n3\n L929 cells were seeded on 48-well plates and incubated at 37\u00baC, 5% \n\nCO2. After 24 h, microcapsules were added to the culture medium in a ratio of 40 microcapsules per \n\ncell. After each culturing period, the MTS method was performed as described above. In both chapters, \n\nvalues reported reflect means\u00b1standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments, and analyzed \n\nusing t-student test. All results were considered to be statistically significant at p-value less than 0.05. \n\nIn Chapter 10, metabolic activity was evaluated by Alamar Blue\n\u00ae\n and cell viability by LIVE/DEAD\n\n\u00ae\n \n\nassays. Similarly to the MTS assay, Alamar Blue\n\u00ae\n is reduced in living cells, after which it yields not only \n\na colorimetric product but also a very strong fluorescent one, which can be more than ten times as \n\nsensitive as the colorimetric assay [61]. The relative number of hMSCs metabolically active within each \n\nexperimental condition was evaluated by the Alamar Blue\n\u00ae\n assay according to the manufacturer \n\nguidelines. 24 hours after cells seeding, cells culture was washed and then (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 and \n\n(CHI/ELR-RDG\n(-)\n\n)2 microcapsules in serum-free culture medium were added in incremental ratios of 5 \n\nto 100 microcapsules per cell. After 3 and 72 h of microcapsules co-incubation, the fluorimetric \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n200 \n\nreduction of 10% Alamar Blue\n\u00ae\n reagent in culture medium was measured with a microtiter plate reader. \n\nNon-treated cells were employed as positive control and their fluorescence was considered as the 100% \n\nof cells viability. Values reported reflect means\u00b1standard error (SE) of four samples of four independent \n\ncell culture viability experiments at 3 or 72 hours of incubation. The influence of microcapsules/cell \n\nratio on cell viability was analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the post test of \n\nBonferroni. All treatment-related effects were considered to be statistically significant at p-value less \n\nthan 0.05. All data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism. \n\nThe viability of cells co-incubated with CHI/ELR was also examined by a LIVE/DEAD\n\u00ae\n assays. Ten \n\nmicrocapsules per cell of both CHI/ELR microcapsule types were added to the cell culture. The ratio of \n\nmicrocapsules per cell was selected after obtaining the results of the cell viability assays. In this assay, \n\nthe co-incubation with calcein AM and ethidium homodimer-1 allows distinguishing the cytoplasm of live \n\ncells (with esterase cleavage of calcein accompanied by green fluorescence), and dead cells (which \n\ncompromised membranes enable to stain nucleic acids with red fluorescence) [62]. LIVE/DEAD\n\u00ae\n \n\nassays was carried out at different time points (0, 72 and 240 h) according to the manufacturing \n\nspecifications. \n\n5.8.5 Alkaline phosphatase assays \n\nThe activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is evaluated using a p-nitrophenol assay. Paranitrophenyl \n\nphosphate, which is colorless, is hydrolysed by alkaline phosphatase at pH 10.5 and 37\u00baC to form free \n\nparanitrophenol, which is colored yellow. The expression of the enzyme ALP by osteoblasts, whether in \n\na membrane form or in secretory form, is a characteristic of these cells and therefore its expression can \n\nbe a strong indicator of these cells in culture [63]. For alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assays, samples \n\ncollected on each time point were washed with PBS and immersed in 1 mL of ultra-pure water to lyse \n\nthe cells. To each well of a 96-well plate were added 20 \u00b5L of sample plus 60 \u00b5L of substrate solution \n\n(0.2% (w/v) p-nytrophenyl (pNP) phosphate/1 M diethanolamine hydrochloric acid (HCl), at pH 9.8). \n\nThe plate was then incubated in the dark for 45 min at 37\u00baC. After the incubation period, 80 \u00b5l of a \n\nstop solution (2 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH)/0.2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)), was \n\nadded to each well. The absorbance was then measured at 405 nm using p-nitrophenol as standard. \n\nFor each experiment, a standard curve was constructed from reference suspensions at known cell \n\nconcentrations. Values reported reflect means\u00b1standard deviation (SD) of three independent \n\nexperiments, and analyzed using t-student test. All results were considered to be statistically significant \n\nat p-value less than 0.05. \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n201 \n\n5.9 References \n\n[1] Chen G., and Hoffman A.

Adhesive nanostructured multilayer films using a \n\nbacterial exopolysaccharide for biomedical applications\n5\n \n\nAbstract \n\nMedical adhesives and sealants often require that long-term adhesiveness is achieved. In this work, \n\nnanostructured coatings consisting of chitosan and the adhesive bacterial exopolysaccharide levan are \n\nfabricated using layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly. Taking advantage of the electrostatic self-assembly \n\nmechanism of LbL, the charges of both chitosan and a phosphonate-derivatized levan (Ph-levan) are \n\nmeasured and the feasibility to construct hybrid films is monitored and confirmed using a quartz crystal \n\nmicrobalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). The adhesive properties between two identical \n\nbonded films with a total of 100 layers are compared to control films in which Ph-levan is replaced by \n\nalginate, revealing that the detachment force of the former is about 3 times higher than the control. \n\nScanning electron microscopy of the films surface shows that the surface of Ph-levan films is smooth \n\nand homogeneous. Cell adhesion tests were conducted using a L929 cell line. Early cell adhesion is \n\nsignificantly higher in chitosan/Ph-levan films when compared to chitosan/alginate controls. These \n\nfindings establish levan derivatives as bioinspired ingredients for conceiving medical adhesive devices \n\nthat allow achieving enhanced mechanical and biological performance. \n\n                                                 \n5\n This chapter is based on the following publication: \n\nCosta R.

Adhesive nanostructured multilayer films using a bacterial exopolysaccharide for biomedical \n\napplications \n\n \n\n211 \n\n6.1 Introduction \n\nWound healing, robust adhesion and protection towards external physical and pathological harm are \n\nessential characteristics of medical adhesives and sealants, especially when long-term performance of \n\nsuch devices is required [1-3]. However, many synthetic adhesives currently approved present \n\nlimitations, which include poor adhesion in the presence of biological fluids, allergic response and \n\ninflammation [4]. Overcoming these shortcomings requires the use of materials that can provide \n\nsufficient cohesive strength and trigger adequate biological response to cells and tissues. \n\nNature gives us a wealth of resources that can be exploited in biomedicine and tissue engineering \n\napplications. In contrast with synthetic materials, natural-based polymers are similar to biological \n\nmacromolecules, avoiding triggering chronic or immunological reactions and toxicity [5]. \n\nMacromolecular compounds such as collagen, cellulose, and fibrin are used as ingredients for \n\nadhesives and sealants [4,6-8]. Namely, chitosan (CHI) and alginate (ALG) have been widely used in \n\nbiomedical applications including burn dressings, drug delivery and implantation [9-11]. These two \n\npolysaccharides share a marine origin derived from materials existing in shells of crustaceans and in \n\nalgae, respectively, and show biocompatibility, adhesiveness, non-toxicity, as well as bacteriostatic, \n\nfungistatic, antimicrobial and hemostatic activities [5,11]. \n\nWhile the sea is a good source of natural bioadhesive materials, it is possible to find interesting \n\nmaterials in other less conventional sources such as extremophilic environments. An elegant example is \n\nlevan, a linear ?(2-6)-linked fructose polymer (fructan) exhibiting hydroxyl groups that form strong \n\nadhesive bonds with various substrates [12-14]. It has many advantages over petrochemically derived \n\nadhesives, including that it is biodegradable, biocompatible, non-allergic, non-toxic and water-soluble. \n\nLevan is also a bioactive polymer mainly associated with high-value biomedical applications [15,16] and \n\nhas been credited together with xanthan, curdlan and pullulan as the most promising microbial \n\nexopolysaccharides for various industrial sectors [12]. Though microbial levan is produced \n\nextracellularly from sucrose-based substrates by various microorganisms, of special interest is the \n\nhalophilic bacterium Halomonas smyrnensis sp. nov. AAD6T which was reported as the first \n\nextremophilic producer of levan [17,18]. Excreting high molecular weight levan by this halophile to a \n\nhighly saline environment for adhesion and protection points to the superior bioadhesive properties of \n\nlevan that were retained under such unusual conditions. Besides its potential use as a bioflocculating \n\nagent [19] and in drug nanocarrier systems [20], levan produced by Halomonas smyrnensis, as well as \n\n\n\nChapter 6. Adhesive nanostructured multilayer films using a bacterial exopolysaccharide for biomedical \n\napplications \n\n \n\n212 \n\nits aldehyde-activated derivative, were successfully deposited by matrix-assisted pulsed laser \n\nevaporation (MAPLE) resulting in uniform, homogeneous, nanostructured, biocompatible, thin films [14]. \n\nIn light of the properties of levan, we intend to demonstrate that this exopolysaccharide can be used as \n\na promising ingredient to conceive new adhesive devices for biomedical applications. \n\nFilm casting and hot-melt extrusion are common techniques for manufacturing adhesive membranes, \n\nwith the former being undoubtedly the most widely used [21]. However, the use of organic solvents in \n\nfilm casting and the addition of plasticizers in hot-melt extrusion are common concerns when \n\nconsidering the use of such membranes in biological environments. The layer-by-layer (LbL) sequential \n\nassembly of macromolecules is an approach with the potential to address these issues. LbL techniques \n\nare perhaps the most versatile and easy-to-apply of the numerous surface modification tools currently \n\navailable as they are based on the spontaneous adsorption of ingredients \u2013 generally a polymer, \n\nbiomolecule or inorganic particle \u2013 onto a substrate. For instance, the adsorption of charged \n\nmacromolecules (polyelectrolytes) is driven by electrostatic self-assembly (ESA) between two ingredients \n\nand allows the sequential formation of a multilayer film [22-26]. Furthermore, this technique allows \n\nrobust nanostructured coatings to be produced on substrates with complex geometries and, as it does \n\naway with the need for harmful organic solvents, it is of great interest in tissue engineering applications, \n\nsuch as biomimetic composite-like coatings, controlled drug release or manipulation of adhesion, \n\ndifferentiation, proliferation and even function of attached cells [25,27-29]. Because this technique is so \n\nversatile, it is possible to synthesize adhesive films by proper selection of its ingredients. \n\nThe objective of this work is to demonstrate that a phosphonate-modified levan \u2013 henceforth referred to \n\nas Ph-levan \u2013 can be used in electrostatic LbL adsorption to construct nanostructured films with \n\nadhesive properties. For the proof-of-concept, Ph-levan and chitosan were sequentially assembled onto \n\nglass using an in-house developed dipping robot and their adhesiveness was studied by measuring the \n\nshear strength necessary for two adhered films to detach. Their cell adhesion properties were evaluated \n\nin vitro, as well as the surface morphology. We hypothesized that these nanostructured hybrid films \n\ncould have superior adhesive properties when compared to similar films made of the commonly \n\nregarded adhesive polysaccharides CHI and ALG. \n\n\n\nChapter 6. Adhesive nanostructured multilayer films using a bacterial exopolysaccharide for biomedical \n\napplications \n\n \n\n213 \n\n6.2 Experimental section \n\n6.2.1 Materials \n\nMedium molecular weight chitosan was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (ref. 448877, Brookshield \n\nviscosity 200-800 cP, molecular weight 190-310 kDa) and purified by a series of filtering steps and \n\nprecipitation in water and ethanol, followed by freeze-drying. Alginate \u2013 alginic acic sodium salt from \n\nbrown algae \u2013 was purchased from Fluka (ref. 71238, molecular weight 100-200 kDa). \n\nPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS), low glucose Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM), sodium \n\nbicarbonate and 4\u2019,6-diaminidino-2-phenylindole-dilactate (DAPI, 20 mg?mL\n-1\n\n) were purchased from \n\nSigma-Aldrich. Fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin-streptomycin and trypsin- ethylenediamine \n\ntetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution were purchased from Invitrogen. The immortalized mouse lung \n\nfibroblast cell line (L929) was purchased from the European Collection of Cell Cultures. \n\n6.2.2 Microbial levan production \n\nMicrobial levan production was performed with the halophilic Halomonas smyrnensis AAD6T batch \n\ncultures [18,30] using pretreated sugar beet molasses as substrate [31]. For this, molasses subjected \n\nto tricalcium phosphate, sulphuric acid and activated carbon pre-treatment was added to sterile \n\nproduction medium (7 g?L\n-1\n\n dipotassium phosphate (K2HPO4); 2 g?L\n-1\n\n monopotassium phosphate \n\n(KH2PO4); 0.1 g.L\n-1\n\n magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO4?7H2O); 1 g.L\n-1\n\n ammonium sulfate \n\n((NH4)2SO4); 0.5 g?L\n-1\n\n peptone; 137.2 g?L\n-1\n\n sodium chloride (NaCl)) to 30 g?L\n-1\n\n final carbohydrate \n\nconcentration and after inoculation, cells were incubated in a Certomat BS-1 orbital shaker (B. Braun, \n\nGermany) set at 37\u00baC and 180 rotations per minute (rpm) agitation rate. For the purification of levan, \n\ncells from the stationary phase cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 11000g for 20 minutes and \n\nthe supernatant phases were treated with an equal volume of ethanol, held at -18\u00baC overnight, and then \n\ncentrifuged at 16000g and 4\u00baC for 30 min using a refrigerated centrifuge. The pellets were dissolved in \n\nhot distilled water, dialyzed against several runs of distilled water for 3 days and lyophilized. The \n\nresultant high molecular weight polymer has a molar mass of at least 1000 kDa [17]. \n\n\n\nChapter 6. Adhesive nanostructured multilayer films using a bacterial exopolysaccharide for biomedical \n\napplications \n\n \n\n214 \n\n6.2.3 Phosphonate modification of levan \n\nFor the production of phosphonated levan, 4 g of levan was dissolved in 100 mL of pyridine by \n\nvigorously mixing on a magnetic stirrer for 48 hours at ambient conditions and then the solution was \n\ncooled down to 0\u00baC. In an ice bath, 4 mL of phosphorus trichloride (PCl3) was added slowly in a drop \n\nwise manner to the well-stirred solution. After stirring for 30 min under ambient conditions, 100 mL of \n\nsaturated sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) was added. The aqueous phase containing the modified polymer \n\nwas separated and freed from pyridine and then subjected to dialysis against distilled water for at least \n\nfour consecutive days with frequent exchanges of the solvent (3\u20135 times per day). The polymer was \n\nfreeze-dried and an overall recovery yield of about 50% was achieved. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) \n\nspectra of levan samples were obtained with Nicolet 6700 Spectrometer within (400\u20134000) cm\n-1\n\n. \n\nElemental analysis of phosphorous was estimated by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis \n\nperformed on the JEOL JSM-5910 LV electron microscope. \n\n6.2.4 Measurement of charges \n\nThe ?-potentials of the polysaccharides were determined using a Nano-ZS from Malvern (United \n\nKingdom), at 25\u00baC. Aqueous solutions of each ingredient were used, at 1 mg?mL\n-1\n\n, 0.15 M NaCl and \n\npH value of 5.5. \n\n6.2.5 Construction of hybrid self-assembled films \n\nA Q-Sense E4 quartz-crystal microbalance (Q-Sense AB, Sweden) with dissipation monitoring system \n\nwas used to monitor the adsorption of chitosan and phosphonated levan onto gold-coated quartz \n\ncrystals in situ. The quartz-crystal was excited at multiple overtones: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13, \n\ncorresponding respectively to 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55 and 65 MHz. Adsorption took place at 25\u00baC, using \n\nsolutions at 1 mg?mL\n-1\n\n, 0.15 M NaCl and at a constant flow rate of 50 mL?min\n-1\n\n, with an adsorption \n\ntime of 10 min (starting with chitosan) and an intermediate rinsing step of 10 min. The frequency of \n\neach overtone was normalized to the fundamental resonant frequency of the quartz crystal, by dividing \n\nit by ? (where ? is the number of the overtone). \n\n\n\nChapter 6. Adhesive nanostructured multilayer films using a bacterial exopolysaccharide for biomedical \n\napplications \n\n \n\n215 \n\n6.2.6 Estimation of the films\u2019 thicknesses \n\nThe Voigt model contained in the software QTools from Q-Sense (version 3.0.15.553) was used to \n\nestimate the thickness of the films from the QCM-D monitoring data. Iterations of the model were \n\nperformed using at least 5\nth\n\n, 7\nth\n\n and 9\nth\n\n overtones. The model requires three parameters, namely \n\nsolvent density, solvent viscosity and film density, to be fixed. The solvent viscosity was therefore fixed \n\nat 0.001 Pa?s (same as water) and film density at 1200 kg?m\n-3\n\n. The solvent density was varied by trial \n\nand error between 1000 and 1015 kg?m\n-3\n\n until the total error, ?\n2\n, was minimized. \n\n6.2.7 Preparation of hybrid multilayer films \n\nFresh polyelectrolyte solutions were prepared by dissolution of chitosan and phosphonated levan in the \n\nsame conditions as the ones prepared for the QCM-D. Commercial glass from a local store were \n\nacquired and cut into 100\u00d720 mm\n2\n slides. The slides were cleaned thoroughly by immersion in a \n\nsequence of absolute ethanol, 2-propanol and chromosulfuric acid for 24 h. Hybrid multilayer films of \n\nthe two polysaccharides were constructed by dipping alternately the glass substrate into the \n\npolyelectrolyte solutions for 10 min, with an intermediate rinsing step of 5 min in NaCl 0.15 M. The \n\nconstruction was assisted by an in-house developed dipping robot that allowed the automated assembly \n\nof each layer in a programmed manner. The construction proceeded until 100 layers (50 bilayers) were \n\nadsorbed. Films consisting of chitosan and alginate were produced in parallel under the same \n\nexperimental conditions for the purpose of comparison. \n\n6.2.8 Adhesiveness of the films \n\nAs soon as the construction of the films was concluded, two glass slides were put in contact face-to-face \n\nwith an overlapping area of 20\u00d710 mm\n2\n. To promote better adhesion, a weight of 6 kg was applied \n\nperpendicularly to the joint area and after a curing time of 24 h, the weight was removed. The bonded \n\nglass slides were placed in a universal mechanical testing machine (Instron model 5540, USA) \n\naccording to the ASTM D1002-05 standard method and fixed by one binder grip in each extremity. A \n\ncrosshead speed of 5 mm?min\n-1\n\n was employed and the samples were stressed until enough force was \n\napplied to trigger their detachment and pull them apart. The lap shear bonding strength was then \n\ndetermined from the maximum of the force-deformation curve obtained. The average and standard \n\ndeviations were determined using the results from five bonded substrates. \n\n\n\nChapter 6. Adhesive nanostructured multilayer films using a bacterial exopolysaccharide for biomedical \n\napplications \n\n \n\n216 \n\n6.2.9 In vitro cell culture \n\nL929 cells were routinely cultured with DMEM supplemented with 3.7 g?L\n-1\n\n sodium bicarbonate, 10% \n\nFBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at pH 7.4. Cells were grown in 75 cm\n2\n tissue culture flasks and \n\nincubated at 37\u00baC in a humidified air atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide (CO2). Every 3\u20134 days fresh \n\nmedium was added. At 90% of confluence, L929 cells were washed with PBS and subsequently \n\ndetached by trypsin-EDTA at 37\u00baC. To inactivate the trypsin effect, cell culture medium was added. \n\nCells were then centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes and the medium was decanted. Prior to cell seeding, \n\nthe surfaces were sterilized by ultraviolet (UV)-radiation for 30 minutes. A 50 \u00b5L cell suspension with \n\n2\u00d710\n4\n cells was added to glass slides with 1\u00d71 cm\n\n2\n modified with 50 (CHI/Ph-levan) or 50 (CHI/ALG) \n\nbilayers (in triplicate). Surfaces were then incubated at 37\u00baC in a humidified air atmosphere of 5% CO2 \n\nand after 4 h culture medium was added. \n\n6.2.10 Nuclei-staining fluorescence assay \n\nAfter 24 h of incubation, the film samples seeded with L929 cells were prepared for DAPI fluorescence \n\nassay. Briefly, samples were washed with PBS and 10% formalin was added to each well. After 30 min \n\nat 4\u00baC, formalin was removed and samples were washed with PBS. Then, a solution of PBS containing \n\nDAPI (1:1000) was added to each well and let to react for 5 min at room temperature and protected \n\nfrom light. Ultimately, samples were washed with PBS and visualized in the dark by fluorescence \n\nmicroscopy. DAPI stains preferentially double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by delineating cells \n\nnuclei in blue. Adhered cells were assessed by analyzing fluorescence pictures in triplicate using the \n\nsoftware ImageJ (NIH, version 1.46r). \n\n6.3 Results and Discussion \n\nPhosphorylation is a feasible method for modifying the dissolution properties and bioactivities of \n\npolysaccharides. Phosphorylated polysaccharides have found use in various applications as flame \n\nretardant additive, cation exchanger, thickener and binder for biomolecules [32-34]. As such, a wide \n\nrange of potential applications were also proposed for phosphorylated derivatives of the levan \n\npolysaccharide [16]. Considering these facts and the limited literature on levan derivatives, Ph-levan has \n\nbeen chosen as a promising biopolymer and its suitability for the fabrication of adhesive multilayer \n\n\n\nChapter 6. Adhesive nanostructured multilayer films using a bacterial exopolysaccharide for biomedical \n\napplications \n\n \n\n217 \n\ncoatings has been investigated within the scope of this study. The protocol used to modify levan \n\nfollowed the reaction scheme is shown in Figure 6.1. \n\n \n\nOH\n\nHO\n\nH2C\n\nCH2 OH\n\nn\n\nPCl3\n\nO\nO\n\nOR\n\nRO\n\nH2C\n\nCH2 OR\n\nn\n\nO\nO\n\nR = H  or  P=O\n\nOH\n\nH\n\n\u2013 \u2013\n\n \n\nFigure 6.1. Reaction scheme of phosphonate modification of levan. \n\n \n\nThe obtained Ph-levan was then characterized by FTIR and EDS. In the FTIR spectrum (Figure 6.2), \n\nseveral stretching vibration bands were detected: the hydroxyl (OH) stretching vibration bands around \n\n3200 cm-1, two bands around 2900 cm-\n1\n/2930 cm-\n\n1\n corresponding to carbon-hydrogen (C-H) stretching \n\nvibration of fructose residues, bands in the region of 1430 cm-1 that were assigned to C-H plan \n\ndeformation vibration combined with aromatic skeletal vibrations, bands at 1120 cm\n-1\n\n and 1000 cm\n-1\n\n \n\nthat were dominated by the stretching vibrations of the glycosidic linkage contributions of C-O-C and C-\n\nO-H, as well as the 920 cm\n-1\n\n band resulting from the stretching vibration of pyran ring. These bands \n\nare all characteristic of levan polysaccharides reported earlier [31]. By comparison, in the FTIR \n\nspectrum of Ph-levan, more bands could be identified: a band at 2360 cm\n-1\n\n corresponding to the P\u2013H \n\nbond, another one at 1200 cm\n-1\n\n corresponding to the P=O bond, a shoulder at 1045 cm\n-1\n\n attributable \n\nto the P\u2013OH bond and bands around 875 cm\n-1\n\n corresponding to the P\u2013O\u2013C bonds [32-34]. \n\nEDS was performed to further evaluate the efficiency of the modification. From the spectrum in Figure \n\n6.3, a peak of phosphorus was detected and the EDS analysis resulted in an atomic ratio of \n\nC:O:P=44:51:3. Thus, both FTIR and EDS pointed towards the production of a Ph-levan stock to be \n\nused in the construction of the intended multilayer films. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6.

CHI is a well-known polycation due to the protonated \n\nstate of amine groups in acidic conditions [3]. The negative charge of Ph-levan is possible thanks to the \n\nintroduction of phosphonate groups to a macromolecule that is otherwise uncharged in nature.  This \n\n\n\nChapter 6. Adhesive nanostructured multilayer films using a bacterial exopolysaccharide for biomedical \n\napplications \n\n \n\n219 \n\nmodification allows the reaction with CHI via electrostatic interactions. The ability of CHI and Ph-levan to \n\nadsorb in a sequential fashion by relying on ESA was monitored by QCM-D. This technique is able to \n\ndetect mass changes in the order of nanograms per square centimeter and measure the viscoelastic \n\nproperties of the resulting surface [35]. Figure 6.4A shows the normalized frequency, ?F?/? (where ? is \n\nthe overtone) and dissipation (?D) variations for the 5\nth\n\n overtone (25 MHz) after the construction up to \n\n6 layers onto gold-coated quartz sensors. During QCM-D, a favorable and successful construction is \n\nusually identified by a decrease in ?F caused by mass adsorption at the top of the sensor. The ?F?/? \n\ndecreased upon flushing the substrate with the sequence of polyelectrolytes, due to the deposition of \n\npolymer on the surface of the crystal, to an approximate absolute value of 38 Hz. At the same time, \n\nmonitoring of ?D gives an indirect indication of the film\u2019s viscoelastic properties. For instance, an \n\nincrease in ?D represents a shift towards a film with a higher viscous component and damping \n\nproperties that characterize a \u201csofter\u201d film. As observed in Figure 6.4A, the ?D increased to around \n\n17\u00d710\n-6\n\n. Therefore, the assembled multilayer film is not rigid and exhibits the typical viscoelastic \n\nbehavior, a typical situation when using macromolecular systems. \n\n \n\n0 30 60 90 120 150\n\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n \n\ntime (min)\n\n?\nF\n\n?\n/?\n\n (\nH\n\nz\n)\n\n4\n\n32\n1\n\nA)\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n?\nD\n\n (1\n0\n\n-6)\n\n \n1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\nB)\n\nth\nic\n\nk\nn\n\ne\ns\ns\n (\n\nn\nm\n\n)\n\nnumber of layer  \n\nFigure 6.4.

Adhesive nanostructured multilayer films using a bacterial exopolysaccharide for biomedical \n\napplications \n\n \n\n220 \n\nThe QCM-D data was used to estimate the thickness variations of the film with each adsorption cycle. \n\nFigure 6.4B shows how the thickness varied with each deposition cycle calculated using the Voigt \n\nmodel [36]. After the deposition of 6 layers, the film had a mean thickness of 50\u00b17 nm, corresponding \n\nto an approximate total area density of 6.0\u00b10.9 ?g.cm\n-2\n\n (obtained by multiplying the thickness by the \n\nlayer density, 1200 kg?m\n-3\n\n). The results obtained through QCM-D measurements demonstrate that \n\nPh-levan can be used successfully with CHI to conceive a viscoelastic polymeric thin coating using the \n\nLbL approach. \n\nAfterwards, films of 50 bilayers were assembled onto glass slides \u2013 henceforth referred to as (CHI/Ph-\n\nlevan)50 \u2013 for the characterization of their surface and adhesive properties. For the sake of comparison, \n\nmultilayer films consisting of 50 bilayers of CHI and ALG, (CHI/ALG)50, were also constructed and \n\ntested under the same experimental conditions. The formulation of this control film consists of well-\n\nknown adhesive materials which properties were compared with those of (CHI/Ph-levan)50 films. \n\nAdditionally, it was seen before that this multilayer film can be easily assembled using the experimental \n\nparameters utilized in this work.[37,38] \n\nThe surface of (CHI/Ph-levan)50 and (CHI/ALG)50 films was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy \n\n(SEM). Figure 6.5 demonstrates that the former presented a flat surface with few morphological \n\nfeatures (Figure 6.5A) in comparison to the (CHI/ALG)50 control (Figure 6.5B). In both cases it is clear \n\nthat the multilayer films completely coated the surface of the substrates. \n\n \n\nA)\n\nB)\n\n200 \u00b5m\n\n200 \u00b5m\n\nA)\n\nB)\n\n200 \u00b5m\n\n200 \u00b5m\n\n \n\nFigure 6.5.

For \n\nsolid/viscoelastic contacts, it has been reported that if a surface \u2013 either the adhesive or the substrate \n\n\u2013 is rough, the contact between the two surfaces may be incomplete (i.e., the real contact area is lower \n\n\n\nChapter 6. Adhesive nanostructured multilayer films using a bacterial exopolysaccharide for biomedical \n\napplications \n\n \n\n221 \n\nthan the apparent contact area) and evolve with contact time, leading to surfaces to unbind [39,40]. For \n\nelastic surfaces, surface roughness is also known to decrease adhesion [41]. The current work is a \n\ncase of contact between viscoelastic surfaces, a known property of polymer-based multilayer films [35]. \n\nFitting only partially on the described roughness/adhesiveness models, the roughness observed in \n\nFigure 6.5 may have little influence in the adhesion mechanism of these films which, due to their \n\nviscous nature, will depend mainly on the strong adhesive bonds formed by the hydroxyl groups. \n\nMost in vitro methods for screening the adhesiveness rely on the measurement of either tensile or \n\nshear strengths. The first usually tests the perpendicular force necessary to separate two surfaces, \n\nwhile the second determines the force that causes an adhesive to slide on a surface in the direction \n\nparallel to the plan of contact [42]. Although the first is the most commonly used, an adhesive or \n\nsealant in contact with a biological tissue is more prone to undergo shear stress than tensile, due to \n\ninherent muscular movements. In light of this, two glass slides bearing either (CHI/Ph-levan)50 or \n\n(CHI/ALG)50 hybrid films were overlapped as soon as the adsorption of the layers was concluded. After \n\na cure of 24 h, the lap shear adhesive strength was tested. Figure 6.6 shows that the lap shear strength \n\nnecessary to separate two (CHI/Ph-levan)50 films was 2.5\u00b10.3 MPa. (CHI/ALG)50 films required a lap \n\nshear strength of 0.9\u00b10.1 MPa until detachment was observed. \n\n \n\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0A)\n\nla\np\n s\n\nh\ne\n\na\nr \n\ns\ntr\n\ne\nn\n\ng\nth\n\n (\nM\n\nP\na\n)\n\nextension (mm)\n\n (CHI/Ph-levan)\n50\n\n (CHI/ALG)\n50\n\n   \n\n*\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n    (CHI/\n\nPh-levan)\n50\n\nla\np\n s\n\nh\ne\n\na\nr \n\ns\ntr\n\ne\nn\n\ng\nth\n\n (\nM\n\nP\na\n)\n\n(CHI/ALG)\n50\n\nB)\n\n \n\nFigure 6.6.

Adhesive nanostructured multilayer films using a bacterial exopolysaccharide for biomedical \n\napplications \n\n \n\n222 \n\nmultilayer films is similar, but the final displacement of (CHI/Ph-levan)50 is higher, giving rise to a \n\nhigher adhesive strength compared with the control, (CHI/ALG)50. For clinical procedures, \n\ncyanoacrylates have been shown to provide a strong adhesiveness, appropriate for wound closure \n\n(around 68 kPa). Fibrin-based materials are weaker (around 13 kPa) are applied as sealants combined \n\nwith suturing. Hydrogels and other polymer-based devices are also considered weak (ranging from 4 to \n\n17 kPa) and often used as topical wound dressings or as sealants when mechanical properties are of \n\nless concern [43]. Independent studies on adhesive and sealant products available in the market have \n\nbeen made. For instance, Tisseel\nTM\n\n \u2013 a fibrin-based sealant \u2013 and Dermabond\nTM\n\n \u2013 a cyanoacrylate-\n\nbased glue \u2013 showed shear adhesive strengths around 20 kPa [44] and 180 kPa [45], respectively. \n\nHowever, the authors used actual bovine tissues and not glass substrates, although other works \n\ndescribe experimental conditions similar to the presented herein. Yamada et al. [46] showed that the \n\nshear stress between two glass slides overlapped together with dopamine-modified chitosan was over \n\n400 kPa, while unmodified chitosan conferred no adhesive strength. Ishihara et al. [47] also developed \n\na photocrosslinkable chitosan hydrogel with a shear adhesive strength around 3 kPa. (Ph-levan)-\n\ncontaining multilayer coatings adhesives surpass these examples. In comparison with the product \n\nexhibiting the highest adhesive properties (dopamine-modified chitosan, 400 kPa) the lap shear \n\nstrength is about 6 times higher. Thus, levan derivatives provide an enhanced adhesive character to \n\nthese multilayer films that could be useful in applications where strong adhesiveness to a substrate is \n\nnecessary. \n\nIn order to understand how cells interact with films containing Ph-levan, the biological performance was \n\nevaluated in vitro using L929 cells. In biological applications, an adhesive film could be useful to readily \n\nprovide fixation to a tissue either externally as a wound healing bandage or internally as a surgical \n\nsealant for tissues and organs. In order to study the early cell adhesion on (CHI/Ph-levan)50, we \n\ninvestigated the density of cells adhered onto the films after 24 h of culture and compared it to the \n\n(CHI/ALG)50 case. A noticeable difference could be observed: cells adhered mostly to (CHI/Ph-levan)50 \n\nthan to (CHI/ALG)50 (Figure 6.7). \n\n\n\nChapter 6.

DAPI staining of adhered cells on \n\n(B) (CHI/Ph-levan)50 and (C) (CHI/ALG)50 substrates. \n\n \n\nQuantitatively, the mean cell area on the former was around 110 cells?mm\n-2\n\n, a high value when \n\ncompared to the latter, with only around 20 cells?mm\n-2\n\n. The results demonstrated that the biological \n\nprocess of L929 cells adhesion was sensitive to the incorporation of Ph-levan into the LbL surfaces. In \n\norder to optimize biomaterials/cellular interactions this effect is of great importance, since those \n\ninteractions are based on cell surface receptor/substrate ligand binding, which influence different \n\ncellular responses. We believe that levan surfaces will lead to new findings in cell/materials interactions, \n\ncontributing to promote and control specific cellular responses. \n\n6.4 Conclusions \n\nIn this work, the feasibility to construct nanostructured multilayer films containing an exopolysaccharide \n\nfrom an unconventional source, namely from extremophile microorganisms, was demonstrated. Relying \n\non electrostatic interactions, hybrid films containing this fructan along with chitosan were compared \n\nwith a formulation of chitosan and alginate, two natural ingredients widely regarded as good adhesives: \n\nthe incorporation Ph-levan led to the conception of films that required higher strength for detachment to \n\noccur due to shear stress. Furthermore, cells were sensitive to this polysaccharide and adhered in \n\nhigher number. In the context of biomedical and tissue engineering, these films could provide enhanced \n\nadhesiveness and protection to a new generation of wound healing bandages or to surgical sealants \n\nand also surfaces with optimized cell/substrate interactions, fabricated by a versatile and cost-effective \n\nmultilayer technology. \n\n\n\nChapter 6.

A quartz-crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) \n\nis used to follow the buildup of hybrid films containing one polysaccharide (chitosan or alginate) and \n\none of several ELRs that differ in terms of amino acid content, length and biofunctionality in situ at pH \n\n4.0 and pH 5.5. The charge density of the ingredients at each pH is determined by measuring their ?-\n\npotential, and the thickness of a total of 36 different films containing five bilayers is estimated using the \n\nVoigt-based viscoelastic model. A comparison of the values obtained reveals that thicker films can be \n\nobtained when working at a pH close to the acidity constant of the polysaccharide used (near-pKa \n\nconditions), suggesting that the construction of such films is more favorable when based on the \n\npresence of hydrophobic interactions between ELRs and partially neutralized polysaccharides.

Layer-by-layer film-growth using polysaccharides and recombinant polypeptides: a \n\ncombinatorial approach \n\n \n\n231 \n\n7.1 Introduction \n\nSurface engineering is a field of expertise concerned with the modification and improvement of \n\ninterfaces [1-3]. In the past decades, this technique has been widely applied in the field of biomedical \n\nand tissue engineering, where the properties of substrate surfaces need to be tuned to promote cell \n\nexpansion, improve the interface between an implantable device and its biological environment, and \n\nadd stimuli-responsiveness for on-demand surface property switching [4-7]. Layer-by-layer (LbL) \n\ntechniques are perhaps the most versatile and easy-to-apply of the numerous surface-modification tools \n\ncurrently available as they are based on the spontaneous adsorption of ingredients onto a substrate, \n\ngenerally a polymer, biomolecule or inorganic particle, and allow the sequential formation of a \n\nnanostructured film. This technique allows robust coatings to be produced on substrates with complex \n\ngeometries and, as it does away with the need for harmful organic solvents, it is of great interest in \n\ntissue-engineering applications [5,8-10]. As such, LbL methods have already been employed in cell-\n\nsheet technology [11,12], for drug delivery [13-15] and for the creation of three-dimensional scaffolds \n\nfor cell culture [16]. \n\nExploiting strong, long-range electrostatic interactions (e.g., attraction between oppositely charged \n\npolyelectrolytes) [17] is by far the most widely used LbL construction mechanism, often referred to as \n\nelectrostatic self-assembly (ESA). LbL synthesis is not restricted to this mechanism: this technique relies \n\non the existence of multiple complementary intermolecular interactions that allow the LbL concept to be \n\nwidened to include hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions (often referred to as secondary or \n\nnonelectrostatic interactions) [18-20]. Nowadays, it is assumed that the gain in entropy is also a key \n\nphenomenon for LbL construction which results from the release of counter-ions. The outcome of such \n\na mechanism is often the organization of the layers in a more coiled and interdigitated conformation \n\nand loss of degrees of freedom from the polyelectrolyte molecules [19-21]. \n\nHerein we intend to demonstrate the feasibility of LbL synthesis using natural marine-based \n\npolysaccharides [chitosan (CHI) and alginate (ALG)] and nature-inspired polypeptides, in this case \n\nelastin-like recombinamers (ELRs), which are the recombinant analogs of elastin-like polymers (ELPs). \n\nThe polycationic chitosan and polyanionic alginate are well-known polysaccharides derived from marine \n\ncrustaceans and brown algae, respectively [22]. Both polymers are non-toxic and exhibit adhesive, \n\nbacteriostatic, fungistatic, hemostatic and antimicrobial effects that make them suitable for use in \n\nwound dressings and drug-delivery systems [23-25]. ELRs are genetically modified biocompatible and \n\n\n\nChapter 7. Layer-by-layer film-growth using polysaccharides and recombinant polypeptides: a \n\ncombinatorial approach \n\n \n\n232 \n\nstimuli-responsive polypeptides that mimic natural elastin, the extracellular elastic protein found in \n\nhigher classes of animals [26-28]. These polypeptides exhibit a transition temperature (Tt) in aqueous \n\nsolution above which free polymer chains adopt random coil conformations and separate from the \n\nsolvent. ELRs follow the standard repeating structure of elastin, namely valine-proline-glycine-valine-\n\nglycine (VPGVG), a sequence with no electrostatic charge. Besides their smart nature, the most \n\nattractive property of ELRs is their ability to be engineered to contain amino acid sequences with charge \n\nand even bioactivity. Indeed, it has proven possible to construct ELRs containing sequences that \n\nenhance cell adhesion [29,30] or biomineralization [31]. One could thus consider that such materials \n\nmay be able to act as versatile and fine-tuned models for protein systems, including nanostructured \n\ncoatings for highly specific tissue-engineering applications. \n\nA great deal of time and effort has been dedicated to the widely investigated poly(styrene \n\nsulfonate)/poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PSS/PAH) system, which is currently considered to be a \n\nmodel of how multilayered thin films are built, over the past 20 years [5]. The fact that most studies in \n\nthis field have been based on the application of ESA interactions to synthetic materials with controllable \n\nproperties has hindered a more in-depth understanding of the secondary construction mechanism. As a \n\nconsequence, extrapolation to new tailored materials that are more suitable for tissue-engineering \n\napplications, as is the case for ELRs or proteins in general, has been limited. In this regard, classical \n\nESA has been unable to explain fully the formation of multilayer thin films and the role of secondary \n\ninteractions has been brought into question. A report from Cini and co-workers [32] \u2013 to which also \n\ncontributed Decher, one of the pioneers of LbL \u2013 have also proposed that the construction of \n\npoly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(sodium phosphate) (PSP) \u201cviolates almost all the rules\u201d \n\nof LbL, thereby suggesting a possible contribution from hydrophobic interactions. Our group has also \n\nconsidered that the formation of an ELR-containing multilayer film is almost certainly driven, at least in \n\npart, by hydrophobic interactions [29]. However, to the best of our knowledge, studies that could \n\nsystematically and extensively confirm the role of such interactions in the construction of multilayered \n\nfilms have yet not been reported. \n\nIn this work we intended to study the conditions needed to successfully obtain a hybrid, biomimetic LbL \n\nfilm that combines the properties of natural and genetically modified polymers. We resorted to a quartz-\n\ncrystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), a technique that is able to detect adsorbed \n\nsurface density changes in the order of ng?cm\n-2\n\n and measure the viscoelastic properties of the resulting \n\nsurface in real time. Based on the piezoelectric effect, QCM has proven to be a powerful technique for \n\n\n\nChapter 7. Layer-by-layer film-growth using polysaccharides and recombinant polypeptides: a \n\ncombinatorial approach \n\n \n\n233 \n\nevaluating the growth of multilayer films as well as for monitoring the effect of factors such as \n\nconcentration, molecular weight and pH during or after their assembly [33-37]. Thus, our objectives \n\nwere (i) to study the influence of ESA and secondary interactions in the buildup mechanism of the \n\nproposed hybrid films by means of charge variations dependent on pH, (ii) study the influence of \n\ndistinct ELR molecular weights (Mn), (iii) compare the feasibility of the construction when using two \n\ndistinct polysaccharides, CHI and ALG, and (iv) extend the knowledge of LbL mechanisms to the class \n\nof ELRs. \n\n7.2 Experimental section \n\n7.2.1 Materials \n\nMedium molecular weight chitosan was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (reference 448877, Brookshield \n\nviscosity 200-800 cP, molecular weight 190-310 kDa) and purified by a series of filtering steps and \n\nprecipitation from water and ethanol, followed by freeze-drying. To determine the degree of \n\ndeacetylation (DD) of chitosan, hydrogen-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (\n1\nH-NMR) was performed using \n\na Varian MR-400 spectrometer. 10 mg of chitosan was dissolved in 1 mL of deuterated water (D2O) and \n\n20 \u00b5L of deuterated hydrochloric acid (DCl). An aliquot of this solution was placed in a 5 mm NMR tube \n\nand the spectrum recorded at 60\u00b0C. The calculation method of DD was described elsewhere [38] and \n\nwas determined to be 82%. Alginate (alginic acid sodium salt from brown algae) was purchased from \n\nFluka (reference 71238, molecular weight 100-200 kDa). ELRs were obtained by the induced gene \n\nexpression of recombinant Escherichia coli strains containing the expressing gene. Each ELR was \n\ninduced in a 12 L Applikon fermenter, in terrific broth medium (TB) supplemented with carbenicillin \n\n(0.1% v/v) and glucose (0.1% v/v), under controlled conditions of temperature (37 \u00baC) and pH (7.00). \n\nFermentation was stopped after registering an optical density variation at 600 nm of less than 0.25, in \n\na time-frame of 1 hour. The culture was then harvested by centrifugation, resuspended and lysed by \n\nultrasonic disruption. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation and the cleared lysate was \n\nsubjected to several cycles of cold and warm centrifugations (4 and 40\u00baC, respectively). All purification \n\nsteps were carried out in sodium chloride solution (0.5 M). The polymer in solution was dialyzed against \n\nultrapure water, frozen at -24\u00baC and freeze-dried. \n\n\n\nChapter 7. Layer-by-layer film-growth using polysaccharides and recombinant polypeptides: a \n\ncombinatorial approach \n\n \n\n234 \n\n7.2.2 Assessment of the ELR compositions \n\nThe molecular weight and amino acid composition of the samples obtained were determined by matrix-\n\nassisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF) and amino acid \n\ncontent analysis, respectively. These methods, and their results, are described in more detail in the \n\nSupporting Information. The percentage of residues subject to ionization and the proportion of positive \n\nand negative charges were also calculated. \n\n7.2.3 Measurement of the charges \n\nThe ?-potentials of the polysaccharides and ELRs were determined using a Nano-ZS from Malvern \n\n(United Kingdom), at 25\u00baC. Aqueous solutions of each ingredient were used, at 100 ?g?mL\n-1\n\n, 0.15 M \n\nNaCl and pH values of 4.0 or 5.5. \n\n7.2.4 Construction of hybrid self-assembled films \n\nA Q-Sense E4 quartz-crystal microbalance (Q-Sense AB, Sweden) with dissipation monitoring system \n\nwas used to monitor the adsorption of polysaccharides and ELRs onto gold-coated quartz crystals in situ \n\n(Q-Sense, reference QSX301). The assembled films consisted of a series of polysaccharide/ELR \n\ncombinations at pH values of either 4.0 or 5.5, thus resulting in a total of 36 different conditions. \n\nCombinations containing chitosan had this polycation as the first layer, whereas those containing \n\nalginate had this polyanion as the second layer. The quartz-crystal was excited at multiple overtones (1, \n\n3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13, corresponding to 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55 and 65 MHz respectively). Adsorption \n\ntook place at 25\u00baC, using solutions at 100 ?g?mL\n-1\n\n, 0.15 M NaCl and at a constant flow rate of 50 \n\nmL?min\n-1\n\n, with an adsorption time of 15 minutes and an intermediate rinsing step of 10 minutes. \n\n7.2.5 Estimation of the film thicknesses \n\nThe Voigt-based viscoelastic model contained in the QTools software from Q-Sense (version 3.0.15.553) \n\nwas used to estimate the thickness of the films from the QCM-D monitoring data. Iterations of the \n\nmodel were performed using at least three overtones. The model requires three parameters, namely \n\nsolvent density, solvent viscosity and film density, to be fixed. The solvent viscosity was therefore fixed \n\nat 0.001 Pa?s (same as water) and the film density at 1200 kg.m\n-3\n\n (often assumed to return the lowest \n\n\n\nChapter 7. Layer-by-layer film-growth using polysaccharides and recombinant polypeptides: a \n\ncombinatorial approach \n\n \n\n235 \n\ncalculation error) [29,37,39]. The solvent density was varied by trial and error between 1000 and 1060 \n\nkg?m\n-3\n\n until the total error, ?\n2\n, was minimized. \n\n7.3 Results and discussion \n\n7.3.1 Characterization of the polysaccharides and ELRs \n\nWe selected nine ELRs for this study as the genetically engineered origin of these compounds allows a \n\nclass of materials that can differ in terms of sequence, length and bioactivity without significantly \n\naltering the original elastin backbone to be studied. The properties of each ELR are summarized in \n\nTable 7.1 according to their molecular weight, Mn, amino acid sequence and proportions of \n\ncharged/uncharged and positive/negative residues. The acronyms were assigned on the basis of their \n\ndistinct sequence, function and variations on the repeating (VPGVG) sequence. The experimental amino \n\nacid composition and MALDI-TOF values can be found in Supplemental Information (Supplemental \n\nTable 7.1, Supplemental Table 7.2, Supplemental Table 7.3, Supplemental Figure 7.1) showing that \n\nthe experimental Mn and number of amino acids agree well with the theoretical values of Table 7.1. \n\nArginine (R), histidine (H) and lysine (K) are positively charged when protonated and aspartic acid (D) \n\nand glutamic acid (E) are negatively charged when deprotonated. The properties of these residues were \n\ntaken into account when calculating the charged and amino acid proportions. A closer look at each ELR \n\nsequence shows that they are all distinct and that some even exhibit motifs with biological relevance \n\nthat could make them useful for current therapies and applications: 3K-VRGDV and H-RGD6, for \n\nexample, contain the RGD sequence, which promotes cell adhesion. 3K-VRDG\n(-)\n\nV is the negative control \n\nof the former as it contains the same sequence but with a scrambled, non-functional RDG motif. \n\nSimilarly, HAP3, H3A20 and H3A20H3 exhibit sequences that promote biomineralization, organized as \n\nsingle, double and triple blocks, respectively, with the alanine-block (A20 portion) being highly \n\nhydrophobic. GEG15 and IK24 contain E and K residues, which confer anionic and cationic behavior, \n\nrespectively. Finally, the neutralized V84 lacks ionizable residues and is therefore uncharged. \n\nAlthough the original sequence of V84 contains three K-residues, which in theory should confer a \n\npositive charge on this ELR, it was neutralized in order to use it as a neutral control (see Supplemental \n\nInformation, \u201cneutralization of V84\u201d). This sequence was used to analyze the buildup of a neutral ELR \n\nhybrid film in comparison with ELRs that are susceptible to ionization. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 7.

Layer-by-layer film-growth using polysaccharides and recombinant polypeptides: a \n\ncombinatorial approach \n\n \n\n237 \n\nLike most proteins, the ionizable residues in the backbone of these ELRs represent only a small fraction \n\nof the whole sequence (maximum of 11.4% in the case of HAP3). Therefore, although ELRs can be \n\nmodified to include specific peptide sequences, they still retain the basic properties of this class of \n\npolymers. This is a relevant property for the present study, considering that the nonionizable residues \n\nmay interact by hydrophobic interactions. Despite the fact that these interactions are weaker and have a \n\nshorter range than their electrostatic counterparts, they nevertheless have been shown to play an \n\nimportant role in stabilizing the internal structure of multilayers containing uncharged groups, such as \n\nmost proteins, which contain large numbers of hydrophobic groups [40-42]. \n\nUsing a group of ELRs with such distinct properties, we expected to be able to identify the properties \n\nthat are essential for the construction of this kind of hybrid nanostructured film, especially films \n\ncontaining complex ELRs with bioactivity and practical relevance. \n\n7.3.2 Effect of the charged state by means of the ?-potential \n\nOne of the parameters to be studied was the influence of electrostatic interactions \u2013 or lack of them \u2013 \n\nduring the growth process. To this end, we measured the charge of each ELR and polysaccharide prior \n\nto the QCM-D experiments by determining their ?-potentials at pH 4.0 and 5.5. The results are shown in  \n\nTable 7.2.  \n\n \n\nTable 7.2. ?-potentials (mV) for CHI, ALG and the ELRs at pH values of 4.0 and 5.5. \n\n \npH 4.0 pH 5.5 \n\n3K-VRDG(-)V -2.7\u00b10.6 -9.3\u00b11.5 \n\n3K-VRGDV -2.1\u00b10.2 -8.4\u00b10.3 \n\nHAP3 -0.4\u00b10.8 -6.8\u00b10.7 \n\nGEG15 -2.9\u00b10.6 -4.4\u00b10.4 \n\nH3A20 -13.3\u00b11.7 -10.7\u00b12.8 \n\nIK24 3.5\u00b10.4 1.6\u00b10.1 \n\nH-RGD6 1.8\u00b10.1 -5.1\u00b11.0 \n\nH3A20H3 -17.7\u00b12.1 -15.0\u00b12.6 \n\nNeutralized V84 1.1\u00b10.8 -1.0\u00b10.1 \n\nCHI 16.8\u00b10.8 13.1\u00b10.3 \n\nALG -8.3\u00b11.0 -17.5\u00b11.5 \n\n\n\nChapter 7. Layer-by-layer film-growth using polysaccharides and recombinant polypeptides: a \n\ncombinatorial approach \n\n \n\n238 \n\nIn the case of the polysaccharides, CHI exhibited a positive and ALG a negative charge as expected and, \n\nsince both contain ionizable groups, their charge varied with the pH, with their potential decreasing at \n\nthe pH value closest to their respective pKa as their charges were progressively neutralized [close to the \n\npKa of ALG (?3.2\u20134) [43] and CHI (?6) [25], respectively]. As for the ELRs, it is interesting to note that, \n\nirrespective of the pH, in general they are all negatively charged despite the fact that all ELRs, except \n\nGEG15, have a higher proportion of residues that are susceptible of exhibiting a positive charge, with \n\nthe highest being H-RGD6 (84.4%) and IK24 (96%), in comparison to the number of negative ones. \n\nOne would expect that some ELRs should exhibit positive values, especially at pH 4.0, where the \n\navailability of uncharged protonated \u2013COOH groups would be higher. The complexity of the ELR \n\npolypeptide family may explain why this did not occur: characteristics such as chain conformation and \n\nresidue exhibition/inhibition may vary among different peptide sequences. Indeed, previous studies \n\nhave shown that the pKa of ionizable side-chains may change significantly, for example with small \n\nchanges in the amino acid sequence [44,45]. However, such a characterization was not in the scope of \n\nthis work since only the effective charge of each polymer in solution was considered when reaching the \n\nconclusions presented below. The IK24 and H-RGD6 ELRs are indeed positively charged at pH 4.0. In \n\nthe case of the former, although it has an E-residue that can be ionized with a negative charge, the fact \n\nthat the K-residues are in excess does not allow for a charge sign inversion below pH 5.5. A similar \n\nsituation was found for neutralized V84, which contains no ionizable residues, although in this case the \n\nsmall charge fluctuation is due to the effect of pH on the N\u2013 and C\u2013termini. In contrast, the block-ELRs \n\n(H3A20 and H3A20H3) are more negative at pH 4.0 than at pH 5.5. Again, it is likely that a different \n\nconformation arises as a result of organization of the ELR into blocks and their amphiphilic nature. \n\nCurrently, two models are accepted to explain LbL growth driven by electrostatic interactions. One \n\nstates that the LbL ingredients should have a minimum charge density with opposite signs, whereas the \n\nother states that, rather than having a minimum charge density, it is the charge balance that favors the \n\nbuildup, i.e., that two ingredients are equally and symmetrically charged. Also, the gain of entropy can \n\nbe hypothesized. For instance, it is known that, when using weak polyelectrolytes, polymers with a \n\nhigher number of charged and polar groups tend to be adsorbed as a thin layer with a flat chain \n\nconformation whereas more neutral ones tend to be adsorbed as a thicker layer and to form loop-type \n\nstructures [46-48]. Since the ELRs used herein are modified versions of the basic repeating block of \n\nelastin (some with charged amino acids) they would appear to be the ingredient with the most \n\nhydrophobic backbone rather than the polysaccharides, and thus have a higher contribute to the \n\n\n\nChapter 7. Layer-by-layer film-growth using polysaccharides and recombinant polypeptides: a \n\ncombinatorial approach \n\n \n\n239 \n\nentropy mechanism due to the formation of loopier and interdigitated layers. Moreover, changing the pH \n\nof weak polyelectrolytes, namely the polysaccharides used, will also vary their ionizable state, making \n\nthem more charged or less charged. However, unlike the presence or absence of electrostatic charges, \n\nthe real weight of the entropic gain in the LbL mechanism cannot be directly measured, and thus was \n\nleft out of the discussion presented below. In light of the above, we defined 36 test conditions. Each \n\ncondition is a combination of a polysaccharide (CHI or ALG) with one of the nine ELRs. Each one of \n\nthese combinations was then studied at two pH values: 4.0 and 5.5, close to the pKa of ALG and CHI, \n\nrespectively. This allowed combinations containing fully charged/ionized or partially charged (near-pKa \n\nconditions) forms of polysaccharides with ELRs to be compared. For convenience, each permutation \n\ncombining ELRs and either ALG or CHI at pH 4.0 or 5.5 will henceforth be referred to as ALG40 or \n\nCHI40 and ALG55 or CHI55, respectively. \n\nOur first step was to represent graphically the ?-potentials of the polysaccharides and ELRs at each pH \n\nin Figure 7.1, in order to estimate the influence of the above-mentioned models. In this graphic, each \n\nend of the column represents the charge of each ingredient used in each of the 36 combinations. \n\nLighter colors are used when the ingredients possess the same charge sign. First, identifying the \n\npotential combinations meeting the first ESA theory mentioned above is simple, since the only \n\nrequirement is that the ingredients possess charge with opposite sign. Most CHI permutations meet the \n\ncriteria, with only a few ALG ones. Second, we analyzed the charge balance under each condition. For \n\nCHI combinations, in general the ?-potential of the highly charged chitosan is not matched by the \n\nweakly charged ELRs under CHI40 conditions. This situation can be seen graphically by the different \n\nlengths of the bars on the positive and negative sides, or by bars represented in only one charge side. \n\nHowever, at pH 5.5, CHI becomes less charged (+13.1\u00b10.3 mV, in comparison to +16.8\u00b10.8 mV) and \n\nat the same time the charge of the ELRs shifts to a more negatively charged state (notice that the \n\ncharge of CHI and the block polypeptides H3A20 and H3A20H3 are balanced in either condition), thus \n\nleading to a more effective net charge balance. A similar trend is observed for ALG combinations. ALG \n\nat pH 4.0 is partially neutralized and the ?-potentials of the ELRs shift toward more positive values. This \n\nway, a more favorable electrostatic situation between ALG and ELRs is achieved but in a different \n\nmanner than when using CHI: whereas with CHI55 balance is achieved by a decrease of its positive \n\ncharge and an increase in the negative charge of the ELRs, with ALG40 a reduction in the electrostatic \n\nrepulsion arising from a lower ionization state of ALG and the ELRs is observed, thereby representing a \n\nshift toward a situation where uncharged group interaction is maximized. \n\n\n\nChapter 7.

Range of ?-potentials for each polysaccharide/ELR combination. CHI40, CHI55, ALG40 \n\nand ALG55 represent combinations of CHI or ALG at pH 4.0 or pH 5.5. The division serves to indicate \n\nthe charge balance between each polymer in terms of positive (red) and negative (blue) proportion of \n\nthe whole bar length. Bars depicted in light blue and purple represent combinations in which both \n\npolymers exhibit potential with the same signal. For example, in the first column, where CHI and 3K-\n\nVRDG\n(-)\n\nV were used at pH 4.0, the ?-potentials were +16.8 mV and -2.7 mV, respectively. In the last \n\ncolumn, where ALG and V84 were used at pH 5.5, the ?-potentials were -15.5 mV and -1 mV, \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\nGiven the potential mechanisms at work under the different polysaccharide/ELR/pH permutations, we \n\nhave resorted to the QCM-D in order to determine the type of mechanism in which the construction of \n\nhybrid polysaccharide/ELR films majorly depends. \n\n7.3.3 QCM-D data acquisition \n\nEach experiment was conducted using a QCM-D to monitor the sequential adsorption of a single \n\npolysaccharide and an ELR. In each experiment, the pH of the solutions used (polymeric and rinsing) \n\nwas adjusted to either 4.0 or 5.5. Also, in order to avoid the induction of conformational changes and \n\ndata acquisition noise from the layers that had assembled previously, the pH values of the solutions \n\nused in each experiment were adjusted to the same value.

Layer-by-layer film-growth using polysaccharides and recombinant polypeptides: a \n\ncombinatorial approach \n\n \n\n242 \n\nDuring QCM-D acquisition, a favorable and successful construction is usually identified by a decrease in \n\n?F caused by mass adsorption at the surface of the gold-coated quartz sensor. At the same time, \n\nmonitoring of ?D gives an indirect indication of the film\u2019s viscoelastic properties. For instance, an \n\nincrease in ?D represents a shift towards a film with a higher viscous component and damping \n\nproperties that becomes \u201csofter\u201d, which is typical of polymeric LbL films. The dissipation values for a \n\nsoft film are higher due to increased energy loss from the crystal, whereas smaller dissipation values \n\nare obtained for a rigid film. It is this dampening to the crystal\u2019s oscillation that is registered as \n\ndissipation, ?D [49,50]. A closer look at Figure 7.2 allows the most favorable conditions for LbL \n\nconstruction of these hybrid films to be identified, namely pH values close to the pKa of the \n\npolysaccharide used, i.e. conditions ALG40 and CHI55, with absolute ?F5 values of around 225 and \n\n200 Hz, respectively. Under these conditions, the amplitude of ?F is greater than for the others. A \n\nsimilar trend is observed for ?D. \n\n7.3.4 Data modeling and thickness analysis \n\nThe data acquired allowed the thickness of the films obtained under each of the 36 conditions to be \n\nestimated. When constructing rigid films, the frequency values are related to the adsorbed film mass \n\n(?m) and that mass is directly related to ?F, a relation that is given by the well-known Sauerbrey \n\nequation (equation 8.1): \n\nn\n\nFC\nm\n\n??\n???  (8.1) \n\nwhere C is the mass sensitivity constant and n is the overtone number. However, this relation cannot be \n\nused for soft films that exhibit viscoelastic properties since the water content and swelling behavior are \n\nalso reflected in ?F and must be taken into account. Therefore, in order to compare every combination \n\nin this study, the obtained frequency and dissipation values were converted to their estimated thickness \n\nusing the Voigt-based viscoelastic model [51], which is integrated into the QTools software from Q-\n\nSense, based on equations 8.2 and 8.3: \n\n?\n??\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n???? ?\n?\n\n222\n\n22\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n00\n\n2\n2\n\n1\n\njj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nkj\n\njj\nhh\n\nh\nF\n\n???\n\n??\n\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n?\n\n?\n\n??\n (8.2) \n\n??\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?? ?\n?kj jj\n\nj\n\nj\nh\n\nhf\nD\n\n222\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n00\n\n2\n2\n\n1\n\n???\n\n??\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n??\n (8.3) \n\n\n\nChapter 7. Layer-by-layer film-growth using polysaccharides and recombinant polypeptides: a \n\ncombinatorial approach \n\n \n\n243 \n\nwhere, considering a total of k thin viscoelastic layers, ?0 and h0 are the density and thickness of the \n\nquartz crystal, ?3 is the viscosity of the bulk liquid, ?3 is the viscous penetration depth of the shear wave \n\nin the bulk liquid, ?3 is the density of liquid, ? is the elastic shear modulus of an overlayer and ? is the \n\nangular frequency of the oscillation. Together with the integrated Voigt-based viscoelastic model, QCM-D \n\nconstitutes a technique that is both precise and simple to use, allowing one to obtaining a film\u2019s \n\nproperties quickly when comparing to other techniques, such as ellipsometry and surface plasmon \n\nspectroscopy. The thickness results can be found in Figure 7.3. Also, the numerical thickness and ?\n2\n \n\nvalues associated with the model fitting can be found in Supplemental Figure 7.3. The results for CHI \n\nand ALG combinations were subsequently analyzed separately in order to avoid an analysis of \n\nconstruction mechanisms that cannot be solely explained by the thickness and potential but are also \n\ninfluenced by the specific nature of the polymer itself. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7.3. Thickness values for multilayered films containing five bilayers, as estimated using the \n\nVoigt-based viscoelastic model, for each polysaccharide/ELR permutation at pH 4.0 and pH 5.5. \n\nDeviation bars represent two standard deviations. \n\n \n\nIn LbL growth, different materials tend to adsorb with distinct kinetics and conformations, thus meaning \n\nthat although both CHI and ALG are polysaccharides, they will react differently with ELRs in a multilayer \n\nhybrid film. The series plotted in Figure 7.3 represent the results obtained when using ALG at pH 4.0 or \n\npH 5.5 and CHI at the same pH values. Some combinations were performed in triplicate, leading to an \n\nestimated maximum standard error of 12% (estimated from HAP3 at ALG40). \n\n\n\nChapter 7. Layer-by-layer film-growth using polysaccharides and recombinant polypeptides: a \n\ncombinatorial approach \n\n \n\n244 \n\nFirst it can be seen that the overall thickness values are higher for combinations containing CHI as the \n\npolysaccharide: the sum of all thickness values for CHI is 566 nm, while that for ALG is 456 nm. If we \n\nconsider solely the role of ESA interactions, the overall construction of the films is more favorable with \n\nCHI than when using ALG since the former is a polycation and most ELRs are negatively charged. For \n\nfilms made of H-RGD6, IK24 and HAP3, ALG40 conditions are actually more favorable than CHI55, but \n\nthis observation can be explained by their exhibited charge, with the first two being positive at pH 4.0 \n\n(1.8 and 3.5 mV, respectively) whereas the third is nearly neutral (-0.4 mV). The overall construction \n\nphenomenon looks dependent on the charge sign among the ingredients. However, it should be noted \n\nthat the analysis resulting from Figure 7.1 shows that most ALG/pH permutations do not meet the \n\ncriteria to follow a construction based on a minimum charge density, i.e., the ingredients do not \n\npossess opposite charge sign and the ingredients are all negatively charged. Despite this fact, LbL was \n\nstill possible when using ALG and thus the mechanism of construction must depend on additional \n\nfactors. A more specific look at each polysaccharide combination will allow further data to be obtained \n\nregarding the growth mechanism at work. \n\nWhen analyzing the CHI and ALG combinations separately, another trend was identified. For each \n\npolysaccharide/ELR condition, the thickness is higher when the polysaccharides were only partially \n\ncharged, i.e., at near-pKa conditions. Following again the example of H-RGD6, for instance, the \n\nthickness of films at CHI40 and CHI55 conditions were 22 and 51 nm, whereas at ALG40 and ALG 55 \n\nthey were 65 and 11 nm, respectively. In the case of CHI/ELR films, the model of charge balance and \n\nsymmetry alone could explain the construction mechanism, but for ALG permutations such model is not \n\nvalid, as denoted above. At pH 4.0, there is less electrostatic repulsion between ALG and ELRs are \n\nelectrostatically more balanced than at pH 5.5. The fact that the majority of permutations involve \n\ningredients with the same charge sign means there is no charge symmetry, and thus also conflict with \n\nthe charge balance model. This result suggests that the proposed hybrid multilayer construction \n\ndepends on a lower charge density of the polysaccharides, regardless of charge sign, by increasing the \n\navailability of neutral binding sites, and therefore materials with a low charge density are a key factor for \n\nthe construction of polysaccharide/ELR films. In this case, we hypothesize that secondary hydrophobic \n\ninteractions are a key force driving LbL growth. The block-ELRs H3A20 and H3A20H3 are a good \n\nexample of this mechanism. As observed in Figure 7.1, these polymers are electrostatically well-\n\nbalanced with CHI at both pH values (CHI40/H3A20: +16.8/-13.3 mV; CHI55/H3A20: +13.1/-10.7 \n\nmV; CHI40/H3A20H3: +16.8/-17.7 mV; CHI55/H3A20H3: +13.1/-15.0 mV). Although their ?-\n\n\n\nChapter 7. Layer-by-layer film-growth using polysaccharides and recombinant polypeptides: a \n\ncombinatorial approach \n\n \n\n245 \n\npotentials would favor ESA balance in both cases, thicknesses are higher at CHI55 than at CHI40, \n\nwhere the availability of charged groups is lower in comparison. To further consolidate this observation, \n\nwe have also studied the growth mechanism with the neutralized V84, which has no ionizable groups. It \n\nis noteworthy that favorable LbL growth under near-pKa conditions is also observed for this ELR. \n\nTherefore, whereas ESA interactions are present in all other ELRs, the successful construction of \n\npolysaccharide/(neutralized V84) films relies solely on the density of hydrophobic groups under ALG40 \n\nand CHI55 conditions. \n\n7.3.5 Effect of molecular weight \n\nDue to the complexity of the ELR samples tested, several parameters, namely molecular weight, pH, \n\nzeta-potential, charge density and charge balance between each film component, must be considered to \n\ndetermine their contribution to film growth. In this regard, we have tested the obtained data against \n\nthese parameters assuming that hydrophobic forces play an important role in the self-assembly process. \n\nFirst of all, we plotted thickness as a function of the ?-potential and Mn of the ELRs for each set of \n\npolysaccharide/pH combinations. The variations of thickness with ?-potential (Supplemental Figure \n\n7.2A) and Mn (Supplemental Figure 7.2B) are represented, which shows no clear trend in either case. \n\nAt this point, it was assumed that ELRs with a similar Mn exhibit different potentials, and vice-versa. For \n\ninstance, 3K-VRGDV (Mn=31371 Da) has a charge of -8.4\u00b10.3 mV at pH 5.5, whereas another ELR with \n\nvery similar Mn like neutralized V84 (Mn=35191 Da) has a charge of only -1.0\u00b10.1 mV. The ELRs were \n\ntherefore grouped according to their mean charge and their thickness plotted as a function of Mn for \n\neach defined charge range (see Figure 7.4). \n\nIn general, one would expect that a higher Mn would lead to a thicker film. Thus, whereas a small \n\nmolecule adsorbs in an extended conformation, a lengthier polymer tends to adsorb in a more \u201cloopier\u201d \n\nmanner, thereby providing more anchoring sites for the next layer to adsorb and, potentially, higher \n\ninterpenetration capabilities than smaller ones [52]. For each ?-potential range selected, the use of fully \n\ncharged polysaccharides (ALG55 and CHI40) leads to a thickness decrease with increasing Mn. Under \n\nnear-pKa conditions of ALG, the overall thickness of the films increases with Mn. \n\n\n\nChapter 7. Layer-by-layer film-growth using polysaccharides and recombinant polypeptides: a \n\ncombinatorial approach \n\n \n\n246 \n\n \n\nFigure 7.4. Variations in film thickness with ELR molecular weight sorted by pH and ?-potential. \n\nResults for CHI40 (?), CHI55 (?), ALG40 (?) and ALG55 (?) are shown. The mean thickness of 3K-\n\nVRDG\n(-)\n\nV and 3K-VRGDV films (Mn=31371 Da) is represented. \n\n \n\nHowever, this observation was valid for all ALG40 combinations but not all CHI55 ones, with three of \n\nthe 36 conditions tested being atypical. It can be seen from Figure 7.4D that the thickness under CHI55 \n\nconditions decreases from 49 to 42 nm. The ELR in question is H3A20H3 (Mn=71462 Da), which is \n\norganized into two charged blocks separated by another non-polar block of alanine residues (A). We \n\ntherefore hypothesize that, during LbL growth, the charged blocks are the first to contact with the \n\nunderlying surface whereas the highly neutral and nonpolar block containing a high number of A-\n\nresidues (hydropathy index of 1.8) [53] is much less likely to interact with the hydrated film. Although it \n\nis true that all ELRs possess hydrophobic residues in their backbone, block-ELRs are spatially organized \n\nwith one block completely charge-free, thus limiting its interaction with aqueous solvents. \n\nThe other two anomalous situations can be seen in Figure 7.4F. The first, at CHI55 for IK24 \n\n(Mn=51970 Da), shows a thickness decrease to 22 nm. IK24 exhibits the highest percentage of \n\npositively ionizable residues. As such, even when CHI is only partially deprotonated, it is plausible to \n\nassume that the positive charges of both ingredients (which are stronger and longer in range) repel, \n\nthereby minimizing the interaction between shorter range hydrophobic groups. The second, at ALG55 \n\nfor the same ELR, shows a thickness increase to 27 nm. Under these conditions, the positively charged \n\nIK24 may interact well with ALG as a result of ESA interactions. Note that these Mn-dependent \n\n\n\nChapter 7. Layer-by-layer film-growth using polysaccharides and recombinant polypeptides: a \n\ncombinatorial approach \n\n \n\n247 \n\nexceptions do not conflict with the fact that, for each polysaccharide/ELR combination, adsorption is \n\nmore favorable under near-pKa conditions: ALG55 is still a less favorable condition than ALG40, even \n\nfor the polycationic IK24. \n\nIt is unclear why the trend in this behavior does not completely match the molecular weight model for \n\nLbL assembly and is distinct among many of the studied conditions. Therefore, in light of the uncertain \n\ninfluence of Mn on multilayer construction, the fact that it is only favorable in specific cases leads to the \n\nconclusion that it is not a primary influence on the growth mechanism. \n\n7.3.6 General model for hybrid multilayer growth \n\nWe have shown that a shift toward near-pKa conditions for both polysaccharides, although of different \n\nnature, favors the construction of hybrid nanostructured polysaccharide/ELR films. The same \n\narguments rule out the theory of minimum charge density, since LbL growth is observed even when \n\ncharges of the same sign are present. Based on this extensive analysis, the LbL growth of hybrid \n\npolysaccharide and ELR films cannot be explained by ESA interactions alone, thus meaning that \n\nsecondary hydrophobic interactions must be taken into account. The arguments presented herein are \n\nalso valid for the control ELR (neutralized V84). As this ELR exhibits no ionizable groups, the \n\nconstruction of films with neutralized V84 was also more favorable under near-pKa conditions, thus \n\nfurther clarifying the role of nonelectrostatic forces. A schematic depiction of our findings is provided in \n\nFigure 7.5. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7.5. Representative scheme of the hypothetical interactions occurring between polysaccharides \n\nand ELRs. \n\n\n\nChapter 7. Layer-by-layer film-growth using polysaccharides and recombinant polypeptides: a \n\ncombinatorial approach \n\n \n\n248 \n\n7.4 Conclusions \n\nThe contributions of the molecular weight and electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions to LbL film \n\ngrowth have been extensively studied using a QCM-D method. Thus, a comparison of the thickness of \n\n36 films formed under different conditions (polysaccharide and ELR combinations and the charges of \n\neach intervening ingredient) has shown that the growth of such hybrid nanostructured films is more \n\nfavorable when the polysaccharide used is partially neutral, i.e., near its pKa. Under these conditions, \n\nhydrophobic groups prevail over charged ones, thus highlighting the greater importance of short-range \n\nhydrophobic interactions when compared with ESA interactions. The molecular weight appears to have \n\nlittle effect on LbL growth. Future studies that focus on other parameters, such as ionic strength and \n\ntemperature, should be considered in order to determine whether additional factors affect this \n\ncombination model. These conclusions are important in order to correctly predict the most favorable \n\nparameters for constructing nanostructured films from natural and nature-inspired materials, especially \n\nsince the use of genetically engineered polypeptides could lead to films with tailored properties and \n\nbiologically relevant functions for applications in tissue engineering, drug delivery and biotechnology that \n\nrequire precise and improved specificity. \n\n7.5 Supplemental information \n\n7.5.1 Neutralization of V84 \n\nThe ELR V84 was chemically modified by amidation of the ?-amine group of the biopolymer with \n\npentynoic anhydride as acylating agent. The reaction was performed in trifluoroethanol (TFE) with 10 \n\nequivalents of pentynoic anhydride per ?-amine group and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) \n\ncarbodiimide (EDAC; 5 equivalents) as catalyst. Pentynoic anhydride was synthesized previously from \n\npentynoic acid in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of dichloromethane and diethyl ether in the presence of \n\ndicyclohexylcarbodiimide. \n\nThe reaction mixture was stirred for 3 days at room temperature. After this time, the functionalized \n\npolymer was precipitated into increasing fractions of diethyl ether and dried in a vacuum oven at room \n\ntemperature for 24 h. Once dry, the modified V84 was solubilized in cold water and the crude product \n\npurified by exhaustive dialysis against water, then frozen and finally freeze-dried. \n\n\n\nChapter 7.

Nanostructured thin coatings from chitosan and an elastin-like recombinamer \n\nwith acute stimuli-responsive behavior \n\n \n\n273 \n\n7A.1 Introduction \n\nThe modification of surfaces has been a key aspect in biology and biotechnology, including cell \n\nexpansion, development of biomaterials and preparation of substrates for regenerative medicine [1-3]. \n\nThe surface is the first contact with the organism and dictates the subsequent biological events, namely \n\nthe cellular events and biointegration. This is an approach with potential impact not only on the \n\nproperties of current healthcare systems but also in more cutting-edge ones in tissue engineering. \n\nAlthough several techniques may be used to modify a surface, the last decade has emphasized non-\n\nharmful and versatile techniques to modify polymeric substrates: the sequential adsorption of proteins \n\nand polysaccharides is one of the most promising today. This approach is known as layer-by-layer and \n\nis driven by a multitude of intermolecular interactions \u2013 such as electrostatic contacts, hydrophobic \n\ninteractions, and hydrogen bonding \u2013 that may occur between two distinct materials [4-6]. \n\nMuch work has been done in multilayered systems using poly(styrene sulfonate)/poly(allylamine \n\nhydrochloride) and CHI/hyaluronan [7]. However, the knowledge obtained from such systems is not \n\nalways easily extrapolated to other materials and that limits the use of potentially more relevant \n\ncombinations for LbL in biomedical applications. In this work, we aimed to apply the concept of LbL to \n\nCHI used along with ELRs to conceive multilayered substrates driven by electrostatic interactions. While \n\nchitosan is a well-known biocompatible polycation of natural origin [8,9], ELRs are genetically \n\nengineered polypeptides mimicking the sequence of natural elastin, showing smart behavior towards \n\nexternal stimuli, among them temperature and pH [10]. We hypothesized that different ELRs, although \n\nsimilar in nature and sequence, would display distinct adsorption kinetics. Therefore, we biosynthesized \n\na negatively charged ELR organized as a single block, and an ELR organized into three blocks \u2013 two \n\ncontaining the negative residues and one nonpolar \u2013 henceforth designated monoblock and triblock, \n\nrespectively. Furthermore, we studied the stimuli-responsive properties of the assembled coatings in \n\nterms of wettability and topography variations. \n\n7A.2 Experimental section \n\n7A.2.1 ELRs expression and purification \n\nGene expression of recombinant Escherichia coli strains were induced in a 12 L Applikon fermenter \n\nunder 37\u00baC and controlled pH (7.00). Subsequent to fermentation, the culture was harvested and lysed \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \u2013 Appendix.

Insoluble remains were removed by centrifugation and the cleared lysate was \n\nsubjected to purification based on temperature cycles. The polymer in solution was then freeze-dried. \n\n7A.2.2 Buildup kinetics monitoring \n\nAn E4 QCM-D, from Q-Sense (Sweeden) was used to monitor the adsorption of CHI and the ELRs. \n\nAqueous solutions of each polymer were prepared at concentrations of 100 \u00b5g.mL\n-1\n\n, pH 4.5 and in \n\n0.15 M NaCl. The combinations of CHI/monoblock and CHI/triblock and their depositions were studied \n\nin parallel at the surface of gold-coated sensors, at 25\u00baC. The adsorption time was 10 minutes. \n\n7A.2.3 Contact angle measurements \n\nContact angles were measured in a DataPhysics OCA15 system using a phosphate-buffered saline \n\n(PBS) solution for sessile drop experiments. Coatings of CHI/monoblock and CHI/triblock assembled \n\nonto glass (1 cm\n2\n) were tested for their wettability at 4 and 50\u00baC. The number of layers was defined \n\nbased on the results from the QCM-D. The coatings were immersed in PBS placed under each \n\ntemperature condition. After periods of 10 minutes of immersion in each temperature condition, the \n\nsamples were withdrawn and contact angles were measured. If wettability did not change significantly, \n\nthe samples were placed in immersion for an additional period of 10 minutes at the same temperature. \n\n7A.2.4 Topography studies \n\nAFM tests were conducted in a MultiMode STM microscope controlled by a NanoScope III from Digital \n\nInstruments system, operating in tapping mode at a frequency of 1Hz. A similar protocol to that of \n\ncontact angle measurements was adopted. To assess the influence of pH in the coatings, a similar \n\nprotocol to the contact angle measurements was followed. The samples were immersed in PBS at room \n\ntemperature and 50\u00baC and then retrieved and introduced in the device. \u201cpH\u201d was also analyzed, for \n\nvalues of 7.4 and 12. The analyzed area was 1 ?m\n2\n. \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \u2013 Appendix. Nanostructured thin coatings from chitosan and an elastin-like recombinamer \n\nwith acute stimuli-responsive behavior \n\n \n\n275 \n\n7A.3 Results and discussion \n\n7A.3.1 ELRs peptide sequence \n\nUnder the scope of electrostatic LbL, we developed two ELRs containing negative amino acids \u2013 namely \n\naspartic acids (D) and glutamic acids (E) \u2013 in order to bond with the protonated amine groups of CHI, \n\npositively charged under acidic conditions. Other amino acids are present, however, like lysines (K), \n\nalthough in lower number. Their final sequence is justified by the fact that these recombinamers include \n\nmotifs with potential for biomineralization, which may prove to be useful for future bone regeneration \n\napplications. The representative structures of the monoblock and triblock are shown in Appendix Figure \n\n7.1, along with the corresponding amino acidic sequence. \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix Figure 7.1. Representative structure of the featured ELRs and corresponding block peptide \n\nsequence. \n\n \n\nThe genetic nature of ELRs ultimately allows constructing macromolecules that are more appropriate for \n\ncoatings of medical devices, allowing even to include sequences of biological relevance. However, their \n\nuse for such purpose falls short of expectation and few works exist that use ELRs as ingredients for thin \n\nfilms [11-13]. Comparing both recombinamers, the triblock is different from the monoblock as it \n\ncontains a polypeptide based on the pentapeptide VPAVG in the middle of the structure. This variation \n\nwas introduced to evaluate if the buildup kinetics changes from the use of one ELR to another along \n\nwith CHI for LbL, although their peptide sequence is similar, and to predict if other types of \n\nmodifications would have the potential to be more favorable for multilayered buildup. \n\n7A.3.2 Buildup monitoring of the films \n\nThe ability of CHI and each ELR to adsorb in a sequential fashion was first monitored by QCM-D. This \n\ntechnique is able to detect the adsorption of molecules in the order of ng.cm-2 manifested by the \n\ndecrease of the oscillation frequency of the sensor. It can also measure the viscoelastic properties of \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \u2013 Appendix.

Appendix Figure 7.2 shows the frequency and dissipation variations (5\nth\n\n \n\novertone, 25 MHz) for CHI/monoblock and CHI/triblock combinations. \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix Figure 7.2. QCM-D monitoring of the frequency (?) and dissipation (?) variations for a) \n\nCHI/monoblock and b) CHI/triblock. The dashed lines mark the end of the adsorption of one bilayer. \n\n \n\nThe first case, depicted in Appendix Figure 7.2a, shows a progressive decrease of frequency, ?F, to an \n\napproximate value of 200 Hz, upon flushing the sensors with the sequence of CHI and the monoblock, \n\nup to 5 bilayers. Simultaneously, the overall dissipation, ?D, increases, showing that the film exhibits \n\nviscoelastic behavior, typical of macromolecular systems [14,15]. It is worth mentioning that the \n\ndissipation decreases during the adsorption steps of the monoblock, corresponding to an increase of \n\nrigidity of the film. This characteristic may be usefull for the conception of coatings where a more rigid \n\nfilm is advantageous, like for bone regeneration devices. \n\nAppendix Figure 7.2b, the monitoring of the CHI/triblock buildup is shown. As observed, only 1 bilayer \n\nof these polyelectrolytes was successfully adsorbed, up to a ?F of aroud 80 Hz. The ?F after the \n\nattempt to deposit a second bilayer displays approximately the same value, therefore the following CHI \n\nand triblock molecules did not adsorb to the interface. This behavior can be explaned by the \n\norganization of the ELR: since the negatively charged blocks bond with the polycationic CHI, the \n\nnonpolar one does not intervene in the electrostatic-driven buildup. Therefore it faces outwards the \n\ninterface of the film, rendering it uncharged, limiting the buildup to a single bilayer. When the \n\nadsorption of CHI is attempted, it does not adsorb because of the absence of negative aminoacids from \n\nthe ELR. The results from the QCM-D show that, although the selected ELRs are similar in nature and \n\npeptide sequence, the buildup kinetics along with CHI is different, as previously theorized. \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \u2013 Appendix. Nanostructured thin coatings from chitosan and an elastin-like recombinamer \n\nwith acute stimuli-responsive behavior \n\n \n\n277 \n\n7A.3.3 Wettability variations of the films \n\nELRs have an intrinsic smart response towards temperature in aqueous solutions. Therefore we \n\nexpected to observe some variation of the wettability of each film with the temperature. The study of the \n\nbuildup kinetics of CHI along with a monoblocked or triblocked ELR was shown in the previous section. \n\nBased on the QCM-D data, we tested coatings made of 5 bilayers of CHI and the monoblock \u2013 \n\n(CHI/monoblock)5 \u2013 and 1 bilayer of CHI and the triblock \u2013 (CHI/triblock)1. Contact angle \n\nmeasurements are easy and quick to perform and may give useful insight about the molecular \n\narrangement of a polymer at a planar surface. It is particularly convenient when the wettability between \n\ntwo arrays of conditions is significantly different. Appendix Figure 7.3 shows the contact angle variations \n\ncaused by cyclic changes of the temperature \u2013 from 4\u00baC to 50\u00baC and vice-versa \u2013 and their evolution \n\nwith time. \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix Figure 7.3. Contact angle variations of (CHI/monoblock)5 (?) and (CHI/triblock)1 (?) upon \n\ntemperature changes and evolution with time. \n\n \n\nAt start, the samples were at equilibrium at 4\u00baC and displayed a moderately hydrophobic feature, \n\naround 65\u00ba. Upon increasing the temperature to 50\u00baC, a transition was detected to a completely \n\nwettable surface in both cases. We have previously demonstrated that this observation is the result of \n\nthe ELR transition at the surface due to the triggering of its self-assemble [12]. As a result of such \n\nphenomenon, there is a molecular rearrangement that favors the exposure of charged residues to the \n\naqueous surroundings, while burying the hydrophobic amino acids underneath. \n\nThe transition time was different for each sample, though. While in the case of (CHI/monoblock)5 the \n\nsuperhydrophilic regimen was observed after 60 min, for the (CHI/triblock)1 it took 100 min. This \n\nlonger time can be explained by the exposure of the nonpolar alanines at the interface: the molecular \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \u2013 Appendix. Nanostructured thin coatings from chitosan and an elastin-like recombinamer \n\nwith acute stimuli-responsive behavior \n\n \n\n278 \n\nrearrangement is more delayed, since at first the free charged amino acids are present below the \n\nnonpolar block of the ELR, hindering the rearrangement. The transition is only later fully achieved. This \n\ndoes not happen with the monoblock, since its structure does not contain the highly hydrophobic \n\nportion (see Appendix Figure 7.1). Upon decreasing the temperature to 4\u00baC, both films recovered the \n\nmoderately hydrophobic feature within 20 min. This result reflects the stimuli-responsive behavior of the \n\nfilms due to the properties of ELRs in aqueous solutions. Such behavior is retained and is cyclic when in \n\nthe form of bidimensional substrates. \n\n7A.3.4 Topography analysis \n\nWe determined that the monoblocked ELR is appropriate for constructing multilayered films. Having in \n\nmind that we intend to use ELRs using a multilayer approach along with polysaccharides, we studied \n\nthe topography of CHI/monoblock films with different number of layers. The wettability variations found \n\nin the previous section should be accompanied by topography changes. Appendix Figure 7.4 shows the \n\nimages obtained by AFM for 1, 3 and 5 bilayers. The variations of the topography with temperature \n\nwere also studied, for 25 and for 50\u00baC. Appendix Table 7.1 shows the root-mean-square roughness \n\n(RMS) values for each case. As observed, independently of the temperature, the roughness increases \n\nwith increasing number of layers due to the increase of mass at the surface, a typical observation of \n\nseveral LbL systems [5]. \n\n \n\n \nAppendix Figure 7.4.

Upon increasing the temperature to 50\u00baC, the \n\nformation of nanostructures was detected, caused by the triggering of the ELR self-assembly and \n\nconsequent formation of larger and organized structures. The roughness values also increased in \n\naccordance. These results relate well with the contact angle measurements: the detected \n\nnanostructures result from the molecular rearrangement of the ELR, where their cores are mainly \n\ncomposed of nonpolar amino acids, while exposing the charged residues to the outer regions. Therefore, \n\nthese are micelle-like structures which organization favors the affinity of the films to water. It is also \n\nworth mentioning that similar topography and roughness results were obtained for the variation of pH, \n\nwhich is also known to trigger the transition of ELRs containing lysines (pka ranging 9.4\u201310.6 [16]). \n\nSuch organization at the nanoscale may be used in the future development of patterned substrates for \n\ntunable cell adhesion. \n\n7A.4 Conclusions \n\nThe presented work shows that polysaccharides and ELRS can be successfully combined following a \n\nmultilayer approach to conceive nanostructured films. Both ELRs are similar in nature and peptide \n\nsequence; however the buildup kinetics is different, being limited to only 1 bilayer in the case of the \n\ntriblock. Acute wettability variations were observed as a function of temperature for coatings of \n\n(CHI/monoblock)5 and (CHI/triblock)1, caused by a molecular rearrangement of the ELRs at the surface. \n\nTopography changes were detected at the nanoscale, where micelle-like structures were formed due to \n\nthe increase of temperature or pH. The properties of the films may be exploited in the future for \n\nsubstrates with patterned and tunable cell adhesion. Furthermore, the recombinant nature of such \n\nelastin-like macromolecules may enable tuning their sequence to favor LbL constructs and even adding \n\nbiological relevant motifs. \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \u2013 Appendix.

The synthetic polymer is characterized for its molecular mass and \n\ncomposition using mass spectroscopy and peptide sequencing. The adsorption of each polymeric layer \n\nis followed in situ at room temperature and pH 5.5 using a quartz-crystal microbalance with dissipation \n\nmonitoring, showing that both polymers can be successfully combined to conceive nanostructured \n\nmultilayered coatings. The smart properties of the coatings are tested for their wettability by contact \n\nangle (CA) measurements as a function of external stimuli, namely temperature, pH and ionic strength. \n\nWettability transitions are observed from a moderate hydrophobic surface (CAs approximately from 62\u00ba \n\nto 71\u00ba) to an extremely wettable one (CA considered as 0\u00ba) as the temperature, pH and ionic strength \n\nare raised above 50 \u00baC, 11, and 1.25 M, respectively. Atomic force microscopy is performed at pH 7.4 \n\nand pH 11 to assess the coating topography. In the latter, the results reveal the formation of large and \n\ncompact structures upon the aggregation of ELRs at the surface, which increase water affinity. Cell \n\nadhesion tests are conducted using a SaOs-2 cell line. Enhanced cell adhesion is observed in the \n\ncoatings, as compared to a coating with a chitosan-ending film and a scrambled RDG biopolymer. The \n\nresults suggest that such films could be used in the future as smart biomimetic coatings of biomaterials \n\nfor different biomedical applications, including in tissue engineering or in controlled delivery systems. \n\n                                                 \n8\n This chapter is based on the following publication: \n\nCosta R.

Layer-by-layer assembly of chitosan and recombinant biopolymers into biomimetic coatings \n\nwith multiple stimuli-responsive properties \n\n \n\n285 \n\n8.1 Introduction \n\nThe modification of surfaces has been a key aspect in biology and biotechnology, including cell \n\nexpansion, biomaterials development and preparation of substrates for regenerative medicine) [1-3]. In \n\nthe field of implantable devices, the surface is the first contact with the organism and dictates the \n\nsubsequent biological events, namely the cellular behavior and biointegration. Thus, surface \n\nengineering is of the utmost significance to lead to the conception of devices with an improved \n\nbiological performance [4-6]. \n\nSurface modification has been also implemented to produce stimuli-responsive surfaces for a variety of \n\napplications, including in biomineralization control [7], cell sheet engineering [8,9], surfaces with \n\nextreme wettabililty transitions [10], and microfluidics [11], mostly based on variations of the hydration \n\nstate of polymeric films deposited at the surfaces. Usually, the modification is performed by grafting \n\nstimuli-responsive polymers onto a substrate, which are typically synthetic and nonbiodegradable, such \n\nas poly(N -isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) [12]. A good example of the latter is the work developed by \n\nOkano et al. [9] regarding cell-sheet engineering.  \n\nIn more recent years, emphasis has been given to non-harmful and versatile techniques to modify \n\npolymeric substrates: the sequential adsorption of proteins and polysaccharides, known as layer-by-\n\nlayer (LbL) adsorption, is one of the most promising today. The principle behind LbL adsorption lies in \n\nthe existence of multiple intermolecular interactions, such as electrostatic contacts, hydrophobic \n\ninteractions, and hydrogen bonding, where the cooperative effects of multipoint attractions play the \n\nmost important role. It is a simple and versatile technique which allows producing robust coatings, even \n\nin substrates with complex geometries; because it discards the need of organic and harmful solvents, it \n\nis an attractive technique for tissue engineering applications [13-15]. Multilayer systems have already \n\nbeen proposed for different biomedical applications, including for biomimetic composite-like coatings, to \n\ncontrol the release of drugs, or to manipulate the adhesion, differentiation, proliferation and even \n\nfunction of attached cells [16-19]. \n\nIn this work, we plan to conceive coatings using natural and nature-inspired macromolecules in a \n\nmultilayered fashion using the LbL approach at mild processing conditions. Natural materials are \n\nintricate and multifunctional structures that often inspire scientists to design novel classes of \n\nmaterials [20]. It is the case of elastin-like recombinamers (ELRs), also designated as elastin-like \n\npolymers (ELPs). This family of peptide-based polymers was developed by Urry, relying in genetic \n\n\n\nChapter 8. Layer-by-layer assembly of chitosan and recombinant biopolymers into biomimetic coatings \n\nwith multiple stimuli-responsive properties \n\n \n\n286 \n\nengineering techniques, and have their basic structure rooted in elastin, the extracellular elastic protein \n\nof higher animals [21-23]. In aqueous environment they are known to have self-assembly behavior and \n\nexhibit a transition temperature (Tt): below Tt, the free polymer chains adopt random coil \n\nconformations; above it, they fold into an organized structure known as ?-spiral. Although ELRs respond \n\nprimarily to temperature, the effects of other stimuli, such as pH, ionic strength and concentration, also \n\naffect the transition phenomenon [24]. Their recombinant nature is one of their attractive properties \n\nbecause it allows tuning their physicochemical properties and introducing sequences to extend their \n\nfunctionality, including biologically relevant domains [25,26]. The work of Girotti et al. [27], who were \n\nable to biosynthesize an extracellular matrix analogue enclosing the cell attachment sequence arginine-\n\n(glutamic acid)-(aspartic acid)-valine (REDV), is an example of such versatility. Thus, ELRs are an \n\nattractive option over the most commonly used formulations in LbL adsorption. \n\nSwierczewska et al. [28] have previously reported the use of ELRs for LbL thin films. However, the \n\npeptides were modified and conjugated with either poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) or poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) \n\nto provide positive or negative charge, respectively. Our groups have also shown that ELRs can be \n\nsuccessfully combined with polysaccharides to conceive coatings and some may even be applied using \n\na multilayer approach [29,30]. In order to explore the potential of ELR properties and the advantages of \n\nLbL, we intend to conceive nanostructured thin coatings made from the sequential adsorption of a \n\npolysaccharide and an ELR modified with the arginine-glycine-(aspartic acid) (RGD) cell adhesion motif, \n\nlabeled ELR-RGD. RGD is expected to increase the cell adhesion in vitro and prove useful in the design \n\nof devices with tunable cell attachment or even improved host integration. We selected chitosan (CHI) \n\nbecause, besides being a well-known biocompatible material, it is one of the few polysaccharides \n\nexhibiting positive charge (at acidic conditions), is abundant, and its production is environmentally \n\nsafe [31,32]. \n\nThe proposed system will also allow expanding the concept of multilayered films to a new attractive \n\nclass of peptide-based polymers, making them more robust than simple monolayers, and could bring \n\nnew possibilities in the development of nanostructured coatings of materials in tissue engineering. The \n\nbuildup of the multilayers will be monitored in real time using a quartz-crystal microbalance with \n\ndissipation monitoring (QCM-D). Distinct techniques, such as contact angle measurements, atomic \n\nforce microscopy (AFM), and cell adhesion tests will be used to characterize it. We hypothesize that \n\ncoatings containing this ELR may exhibit changes both in topography and wettability, depending on \n\n\n\nChapter 8. Layer-by-layer assembly of chitosan and recombinant biopolymers into biomimetic coatings \n\nwith multiple stimuli-responsive properties \n\n \n\n287 \n\nseveral stimuli, namely temperature, pH and ionic strength, and improved biological in vitro \n\nperformance. \n\n8.2 Experimental section \n\n8.2.1 ELR-RGD expression and purification \n\nThe featured ELR monomers of RGD were designated as ELR-RGD. Expression conditions and \n\npurification protocols were adapted from Meyer and Chilkoti [33] and Girotti et al. [34]. Gene expression \n\nof a recombinant Escherichia coli strain BLR(DE3) containing the expressing gene of ELR-RGD was \n\ninduced in a 12 L Applikon fermenter, in terrific broth medium (TB) with 0.1% of carbenicilin and 0.1% \n\nof glucose, under controlled conditions of temperature (37\u00baC) and pH (7.00). The fermentation was \n\nstopped after registering an optical density variation at 600 nm inferior to 0.25, in a time-frame of 1 h. \n\nSubsequent to fermentation, the culture was harvested by centrifugation, resuspended and lysed by \n\nultrasonic disruption. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation and the cleared lysate was \n\nsubjected to several cycles of cold and warm centrifugations, of 4 and 40\u00baC, respectively. All the \n\npurification steps were carried out in a sodium chloride (NaCl) solution at 0.5 M. The polymer in \n\nsolution was then frozen at -24\u00baC and freeze-dried. \n\n8.2.2 ELR-RGD characterization \n\nDifferential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) experiments were performed on a Mettler Toledo 822e (United \n\nStates) with a liquid nitrogen cooler accessory. Both temperature and enthalpy were calibrated with an \n\nindium standard at the same experimental conditions used for the studied materials. Water solutions of \n\nELR-RGD at 50 mg?mL\n-1\n\n were prepared at pH 7.4. In a typical DSC run, 20 ?L of the solution were \n\nplaced inside a standard 40 ?L aluminum pan hermetically sealed. The same volume of water was \n\nplaced in the reference pan. All samples were equilibrated for 5 minutes at 5\u00b0C inside the sample \n\nchamber just before the beginning of each experiment. A heating rate of 5\u00baC?min\n-1\n\n was used. To assess \n\nthe biopolymer molecular weight, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) \n\nmass spectroscopy was performed in a Voyager STR, from Applied Biosystems, in linear mode and with \n\nan external calibration using bovine serum albumin (BSA). Amino acid composition determination was \n\npreviously used to assess the composition of ELRs [27]. \n\n\n\nChapter 8. Layer-by-layer assembly of chitosan and recombinant biopolymers into biomimetic coatings \n\nwith multiple stimuli-responsive properties \n\n \n\n288 \n\n8.2.3 Buildup and characterization of the self-assembled coatings \n\nMedium molecular weight grade CHI was purchased from Sigma and purified. Solutions of purified CHI \n\nand ELR-RGD were prepared at 0.1 mg?mL\n-1\n\n in 0.15 M NaCl. The pH of the solutions was adjusted to \n\n5.5. ?-potential of each solution was determined using a Nano-ZS from Malvern (United Kingdom), at \n\n25\u00baC. A Q-Sense E4 quartz-crystal microbalance (Q-Sense AB, Sweden) with dissipation monitoring \n\nsystem was used for monitoring in situ the deposition of CHI/ELR-RGD multilayers at the surface of \n\ngold-coated crystals. This technique has previously been extensively described [35-37]. Very briefly, an \n\nAT cut quartz crystal can be excited at its fundamental frequency (5 MHz) and at several overtones: 25, \n\n35, and 45 MHz (fifth, seventh, and ninth overtones, respectively). When a thin film is deposited onto \n\nthe sensor crystal the frequency decreases. If the film is thin and rigid the decrease in frequency (?F) is \n\nproportional to the mass of the film. However, when using polymers, the adsorbed film is not rigid and \n\nthis relation is not valid: the film begins dissipating energy and exhibiting the typical viscoelastic \n\nbehavior, which is evident by the change in the dissipation (?D). The crystals were first cleaned in an \n\nultrasound bath at 30\u00baC, and immersed successively in acetone, ethanol, and isopropanol. Adsorption \n\ntook place at 25\u00baC and pH 5.5 and at a constant flow rate of 50 mL?min\n-1\n\n. Starting with the CHI \n\nsolution, each one was pumped into the system for 10 minutes. Each deposition cycle was followed by \n\na rinsing step with 0.15 M NaCl, at pH 5.5, for 10 min, and ?F? and ?D were monitored in real time. \n\nThe frequency of each overtone was normalized to the fundamental resonant frequency of the quartz \n\ncrystal, by diving it by ? (where ?=5; 7; 9). The thickness of the films was estimated using the Voigt \n\nmodel through the Q-Tools software, from Q-Sense [38]. The area density was calculated by multiplying \n\nthe thickness by the layer density (1200 kg.m\n-3\n\n led to obtaining calculations with the best fitting). \n\n8.2.4 Contact-angle measurements \n\nPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS) contact angles were measured in a DataPhysics OCA15 system. The \n\ncoatings were prepared at the surface of regular glass microscopy slides, from Marienfeld (Germany). \n\nThe glass was cleaned using the same protocol to which QCM-D crystals were submitted. Coatings up \n\nto 10 layers \u2013 5 pairs of CHI and ELR-RGD \u2013 were characterized for their wettability for each layer \n\nassembled, at 37\u00baC and pH 7.4. An approach described by Park et al. [39] was used to measure \n\ncontact angles dependent on several temperature, pH and ionic strength conditions. The \n\nmeasurements were performed for a pH range from 4 to 12, ionic strength from 0 to 1.5 M of NaCl, \n\n\n\nChapter 8. Layer-by-layer assembly of chitosan and recombinant biopolymers into biomimetic coatings \n\nwith multiple stimuli-responsive properties \n\n \n\n289 \n\nand three relevant temperatures: 25, 37 and 50\u00baC. The samples were immersed in a beaker of PBS \n\nplaced under each condition. After 1 hour, the samples were withdrawn and contact angles were \n\nmeasured. The time of 1 h was determined to be enough to have a stable surface. Upon determining \n\nthe wettability transition parameters, three cycles were performed by changing the transition values \n\nabove and below each transition value. \n\n8.2.5 Atomic force microscopy measurements \n\nAFM measurements were performed in a MultiMode STM microscope controlled by the NanoScope III \n\nfrom Digital Instruments system, operating in tapping mode at a frequency of 1 Hz. Glass slides were \n\ncut into pieces of 1\u00d71 cm\n2\n and used as substrates for multilayer adsorption. Surfaces coated with 5 \n\npairs of CHI/ELR-RGD were immersed in PBS for 30 min. To assess the influence of pH in the coatings, \n\na similar protocol to the contact angle measurements was followed. The samples were immersed in \n\nPBS at two pH values: 7.4 and 11. To avoid the formation of crystals during the acquisition, the \n\nsamples were immersed shortly in ultrapure water for removing excess of saline solution. The samples \n\nwere then retrieved and introduced in the device. The analyzed area was 1\u00d71 \u00b5m\n2\n. \n\n8.2.6 Cell culture studies of SaOs-2 osteoblast-like cells \n\nCell studies were performed onto coatings of 5 pairs of layers, ending in ELR-RGD, CHI or ELR-RDG\n(-)\n\n \n\n(negative control), assembled at the surface of glass coverslips with 1 cm of diameter. Tissue culture \n\npolystyrene (TCPS) was used as a positive control. Cell adhesion was studied using the SaOs-2 \n\nosteoblast-like osteosarcoma cell line. Cells were seeded on the surfaces (5\u00d710\n4\n cell?mL\n\n-1\n) and \n\nincubated in serum free Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM), loaded with 1% \n\nantibiotics/antimicotics at 37\u00baC, 5% carbon dioxide (CO2). The substrates were analyzed at different \n\ntime points: 4 h, 24 h and 3 days. At each time point, cells on the coated surfaces were washed with \n\nPBS twice, fixed in formalin (3.7%) and nuclei of the cells stained with 4',6 diamidino-2-phenylindol \n\n(DAPI), and the actin was stained with phalloidin. \n\nFor alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assays, samples collected on each time point were washed with PBS \n\nand immersed in 1 mL of ultra-pure water to lyse the cells. To each well of a 96-well plate were added \n\n20 \u00b5L of sample plus 60 \u00b5L of substrate solution (0.2% (w/v) p-nytrophenyl (pNP) phosphate/1 M \n\ndiethanolamine hydrochloric acid (HCl), at pH 9.8). The plate was then incubated in the dark for 45 min \n\n\n\nChapter 8.

After the incubation period, 80 \u00b5l of a stop solution (2 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH)/0.2 mM \n\nethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)), was added to each well. The absorbance was then measured \n\nat 405 nm using p-nitrophenol as standard. For each experiment, a standard curve was constructed \n\nfrom reference suspensions at known cell concentrations. To access cell viability, (3-(4,5-\n\ndimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) (MTS) assay was \n\nperformed. MTS is bioreduced by cells. The values for absorbance of this reduced product at 490 nm \n\nare directly proportional to the number of living cells in the substrates. \n\n8.3 Results and discussion \n\n8.3.1 ELR-RGD characterization \n\nFor the past two decades, much work has been done on the widely investigated poly(styrene \n\nsulfonate)/poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PSS/PAH) system \u2013 considered so far as a model of \n\nmultilayered thin films \u2013 and CHI/hyaluronan [16]. However, the buildup mechanism is not always \n\nstraightforward to every material and distinct or several forces may influence the construction [40,41]. \n\nFurthermore, coatings for tissue engineering applications should ideally contain other materials with \n\nmore relevant features, including biological activity. It is the case of the biopolymer used in this work, \n\nwhich contains the RGD cell adhesion motif, depicted in Figure 8.1a. \n\nThe ELR-RGD, with 371 aminoacids and theoretical molecular weight of 31371 Da, contains 2 \n\nmonomers of RGD, 2 aspartic acids, and 3 lysines isolated at the amino-terminal and exhibits a Tt of \n\naround 23\u00baC in solution at physiological pH (data not shown). In contrast to our previous work [30], this \n\nELR-RGD was engineered to facilitate electrostatic interactions during the multilayer buildup. In Figure \n\n8.1b, MALDI-TOF spectrum shows a high intensity peak at 31229 Da, which is approximate to the \n\ntheoretical value for this biopolymer. \n\nIn order to confirm if the produced ELR matched the theoretical amino acidic composition, peptide \n\nsequencing tests were performed.

This \n\ntechnique is able to detect mass changes in the order of ng.cm\n-2\n\n and measure the viscoelastic \n\nproperties of the resulting surface [35-37]. Due to the recombinant nature of ELRs, it is possible to tune \n\ntheir structure to appropriately fit a multilayer approach and design coatings for tissue engineering \n\nsubstrates. Figure 8.2a shows the normalized frequency (?F?/?, where ? is the overtone) and \n\ndissipation (?D) variations for the 5\nth\n\n overtone (25 MHz) after the construction of 20 layers onto gold-\n\ncoated sensors. The ?F?/? decreased with time upon flushing the substrate with the sequence of \n\npolyelectrolytes, to an approximate value of 40 Hz. On the other hand, the ?D increased, revealing that \n\nthe film is not rigid and exhibits the typical viscoelastic behavior, a common situation when using \n\nmacromolecular systems [36,42]. \n\n \n\n0 100 200 300 400\n\n-40\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n \n\na)\n\n4\n3\n\n2\n1\n\ntime (min)\n\n \n\n?\nF\n\n?\n/?\n\n (\nH\n\nz\n)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n?\nD\n\n x\n 1\n\n0\n-6\n\n  \n\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\nnumber of layer\n\nth\nic\n\nk\nn\n\ne\ns\ns\n (\n\nn\nm\n\n)\n\n0\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\nb)\n\nth\nic\n\nk\nn\n\ne\ns\ns\n i\nn\n\nc\nre\n\na\ns\ne\n\n (\nn\n\nm\n)\n\n \n\nFigure 8.2.

Layer-by-layer assembly of chitosan and recombinant biopolymers into biomimetic coatings \n\nwith multiple stimuli-responsive properties \n\n \n\n293 \n\ngroups of CHI. Prior to the monitoring, the ?-potential of CHI and ELR-RGD solutions was measured at \n\nworking conditions (pH=5.5 and ionic strength at 0.15 M), showing a charge of +17.0\u00b10.6 \n\nand -8.4\u00b10.33 mV, respectively. ELRs are essentially hydrophobic by nature but can be modified to \n\ninclude specific charged residues. CHI is also insoluble in water and can only be dissolved at acidic \n\nconditions, below its pKa (approximately 6) [44]. It has been reported that electrostatic deposition \n\ndemands appropriate matching of the charge density of the used polyelectrolyte pair, rather than a \n\nminimum charge density [13,45], but in this case the ?-potential showed no charge balance (i.e. equal \n\nabsolute values). Although ESA was a driving force of construction, other forces, like hydrophobic \n\ninteractions, are likely to participate on the assembling phenomenon. In fact, Figure 8.2a shows the \n\nsuccessful combination of the used pair, at the assembly pH of 5.5, near the pKa of CHI. We can \n\nassume that a fraction of already deprotonated amine groups interacts with the hydrophobic residues of \n\nthe ELR-RGD structure and allow the construction of the coating. \n\nThe QCM-D data was used to estimate the thickness variations of the film along with the adsorption \n\ncycles. Figure 8.2b shows the results calculated using the Voigt model implemented in the Q-Tools \n\nsoftware from Q-Sense [38]. It can be observed that the thickness increased linearly during the buildup, \n\nin accordance with the evolution of ?F? and ?D variations. After the deposition of 20 layers, the film \n\nhad a thickness of 81 nm, corresponding to an approximate total area density of 9.6 \u00b5g.cm\n-2\n\n \n\n(multiplication of thickness by the layer density. 1200 kg.m\n-3\n\n allowed for the best fitting). Figure 8.2b \n\nalso shows the thickness of each layer (\u201cthickness increase\u201d in the graphic). Overall, the increase of \n\nthickness is higher for the adsorption steps of ELR-RGD. This is the result of the lower charged exhibited \n\nby the recombinamer, which requires that more material is needed to overcompensate the charges of \n\nthe underlying CHI ones. The results obtained through QCM-D measurements demonstrate that ELR-\n\nRGD can be used successfully with CHI to conceive a viscoelastic polymeric coating using the LbL \n\napproach. \n\n8.3.2 Characterization of the self-assembled coatings \n\nWhen a material adheres to a substrate, it is expected that such phenomenon will result in \n\nphysicochemical changes at the surface [46,47]. The measurement of contact angles is an easy \n\nmethod that allows a quick assessment of the modification of a surface in terms of wettability, and its \n\nusefulness is even higher when such wettability is significantly different for each layer. Figure 8.3 shows \n\nthe contact angle variation of the CHI/ELR-RGD film with the buildup, up to 10 layers.  \n\n\n\nChapter 8. Layer-by-layer assembly of chitosan and recombinant biopolymers into biomimetic coatings \n\nwith multiple stimuli-responsive properties \n\n \n\n294 \n\n \n\nFigure 8.3. Evolution of the contact angle of the films obtained with sequential adsorption of CHI and \n\nELR-RGD, up to 10 layers Odd numbers correspond to films ending in CHI and even numbers to films \n\nending in ELR-RGD. Error bars represent two standard deviations (n=9). \n\n \n\nThe films were adsorbed onto glass (contact angle of 28.6\u00b12.9\u00ba). Each measurement was performed \n\nafter 1 hour of immersion in PBS at 37 \u00baC. While films ending in ELR-RGD retained their moderate \n\nhydrophobic behavior (approximately between 62\u00ba and 71\u00ba), the ones ending in CHI increased gradually, \n\nfrom 20.4\u00b14.4\u00ba in the first layer to 40.1\u00b13.9\u00ba in the fifth (layer 9). The increasing values of contact \n\nangles obtained for CHI-ending films can be explained by the influence of the underlying adsorbed \n\nlayers on the coating interface. When using weak polyelectrolytes, the most charged polymer tends to \n\nbe adsorbed as a thin layer with flat chain conformations, while the less charged polymer tends to be \n\nadsorbed as a thicker layer, forming loopier-type structures [48,49]. Since ELR-RGD is a modified \n\nversion of the basic repeating block of elastin with charged amino acids, CHI appears as the most \n\ncharged polymer, as already presented by the ?-potential measurements. Furthermore, the thickness \n\nincrease of each layer displayed in Figure Figure 8.2b helps to demonstrate that the ELR-RGD layers are \n\noverall thicker than the ones of CHI. Thus, the surface properties of the CHI layer may reflect the effect \n\nof the underlying ELR one, even in terms of wettability, while the opposite does not occur. \n\nThe featured films were conceived using a recombinant ELR, a biomaterial exhibiting stimuli-responsive \n\nproperties in solution. It would be interesting to observe how the wettability of the films behaves when \n\nthey are exposed to several stimuli. To achieve this goal, we have measured the contact angles of 5 \n\npairs of layers ending in ELR-RGD, labeled (CHI/ELR-RGD)5, assembled in glass substrates, at different \n\n\n\nChapter 8.

Contact angle measurements as a function of temperature (?), pH (?), and ionic strength \n\n(?) in a (CHI/ELR-RGD)5 film. Three cycles are represented. Error bars represent two standard \n\ndeviations (n=9). \n\n \n\nTaking the case of the temperature, at 25\u00baC an initial wettability exhibiting values of 67.1\u00b14.7\u00ba was \n\nmeasured, corresponding to a moderate hydrophobic surface. However, upon increasing the \n\ntemperature to 50\u00baC, the contact angle values decreased to those of a superhydrophilic surface, \n\ncorresponding to a totally wettable surface. ELRs show a phase transition in solution above Tt, similar to \n\nthe transition of other temperature-sensitive polymers with lower critical solution temperature (LCST). \n\nHowever, the hydrophobicity of such a surface did not increase with the switch to high temperatures. In \n\nfact, while the hydrophobicity of surfaces modified with LCST polymers increases [9], the behavior of \n\nELRs when adsorbed onto a surface is opposite to the expected, more in accordance to the case of \n\npolymers with an upper critical solution temperature (UCST), which become more hydrophilic [50]. \n\nSuch atypical wettability behavior of ELR-RGD temperature-responsive coatings has been previously \n\nobserved in a thin ELR monolayer adsorbed onto CHI substrates [30]. We have shown that upon the \n\ntransition, the collapsed biopolymer aggregates into micelle-like structures, as suggested by topography \n\n\n\nChapter 8. Layer-by-layer assembly of chitosan and recombinant biopolymers into biomimetic coatings \n\nwith multiple stimuli-responsive properties \n\n \n\n296 \n\nmeasurements. They assume a conformation where the hydrophobic chains are directed to the inside \n\nand the charged residues to the outside of such organizations. Additionally, while the properties of such \n\nsurfaces change at 50\u00baC, the polymer in solution shows a transition at 23\u00baC, where the association is \n\nmuch more facilitated than at the surface, to which the polymer is tightly connected. \n\nSimilar results to that of temperature response were obtained for pH and ionic strength, and even \n\nexhibiting similar contact angle values. In the case of pH, ELR-RGD has lysines in its structure, which \n\namine groups are protonated below the pKa values ranging 9.4\u201310.6 [43]. Above the pKa, the amine \n\ngroups are deprotonated and the hydrophobicity of ELR-RGD increases. It is known that the more \n\nhydrophobic the ELR the lower the Tt in solution is [34]. Thus, with the increase of pH, the mean \n\nhydrophobicity of ELR-RGD also increases, up to a pH of 11. At this value, the transition to a \n\nsuperhydrophilic regimen was detected, as depicted in Figure 8.4. In the case of ionic strength, \n\nReguera et al. [51] suggested that an increase in the salt concentration increases the polarity of the \n\nsolvent. This creates a higher difference in polarity with respect to the hydrophobic moieties of the \n\npolymer, causing more and more ordered structures surrounding the polymer chains. As observed, a \n\ntransition was detected upon the increase of ionic strength to 1.25 M, which is in accordance to the \n\nbehavior of this family of polymers. These results show that the wettability of (CHI/ELR-RGD)5 films are \n\nstrongly dependent not only on temperature but also on pH and ionic strength, which influence the Tt of \n\nELRs in aqueous solutions as well. Furthermore, the films were submitted to three cycles of variations \n\nand still retained full reversibility and similar contact angle values, showing that the films are robust and \n\ncapable of withstanding sharp changes of the environment, while retaining functionality. \n\nThe results presented so far reflect the nature of the studied ELR, and characterize the conceived film \n\nas a stimuli-sensitive coating that could prove to be useful in the development of controlled release \n\nsystems and in surfaces capable to control cell behavior. In order to have full understanding of this \n\nbehavior, the wettability was further studied for several arrays of conditions, consisting in the \n\ncombination of pH and ionic strength, at three relevant temperatures: 25\u00baC (room temperature), 37\u00baC \n\n(temperature of the body), and 50\u00baC (determined to be the temperature of transition of ELR-RGD at the \n\nsurface). The diagram of Figure 8.5 is the graphical representation of the measurements performed in \n\n(CHI/ELR-RGD)5, in an attempt to characterize the coating wettability. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 8.

Map of the wettability of (CHI/ELR-RGD)5 films as a function of condition arrays of \n\ntemperature, pH, and ionic strength stimuli. Open symbols stand for a moderate hydrophobic surface \n\n(contact angle of about 67\u00ba) and closed ones for a superhydrophilic surface. The blue squares \n\nrepresent measurements performed at 25\u00baC and 37\u00baC and the red circles measurements at 50\u00baC. \n\n \n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first time that ELR-adsorbed surfaces are extensively characterized for \n\ntheir responsive character towards external stimuli. There are two areas represented, or phases: (i) one \n\nrepresented by open squares and full circles and (ii) the other represented by full squares and full \n\ncircles. Blue squares and red circles stand for 25\u00baC/37\u00baC and 50\u00baC, and open/full symbols stand for a \n\nmoderate hydrophobic (characteristic CA of 66.8\u00b13.5\u00ba) or a completely wettable surface, respectively. \n\nThe measurements performed have revealed the conditions of wettability transition for temperature, pH, \n\nand ionic strength: 50\u00baC, 11, and 1.25 M, respectively. The transition was also revealed to be rapid and \n\nindependent of the contribution of the other stimuli: an \u201call-or-nothing\u201d response towards external \n\nstimuli. In other words, the wettability of these systems shifts from a moderate hydrophobic regimen to \n\nsuperhydrophilic only when a stimulus equals or exceeds the above mentioned values, and there is no \n\nevidence of cross-dependencies between the three variables. Therefore, observing Figure 8.5, one can \n\neasily identify the parameters of transition at room temperature and 50\u00baC. In the former, the wettability \n\nshifts at pH 11 or ionic strength 1.25 M, as previously stated; in the latter, 50\u00baC is already the \n\ntemperature at which the wettability shifts, therefore any combination of the other two stimuli can be \n\ndisregarded. \n\n\n\nChapter 8. Layer-by-layer assembly of chitosan and recombinant biopolymers into biomimetic coatings \n\nwith multiple stimuli-responsive properties \n\n \n\n298 \n\nThe measurements performed at 37\u00baC are of particular interest for biomedical applications, since \n\nultimately these coatings are intended to be used in a biological environment. In the graphic, the \n\nwettability of the surfaces at 37\u00baC is similar to the case at room temperature, showing transitions \n\ndependent on pH and ionic strength at 11 and 1.25 M, respectively. However, our measurements \n\nshowed that in the range of pH 10\u201311 and of ionic strength 1\u20131.25 M, intermediate values could be \n\nobserved (CAs of 30.5 \u00b120.6\u00ba). Such behavior is an interesting one: upon heating an ELR in solution \n\nabove the Tt, aggregation occurs and the solution becomes cloudy; given a few hours, or further \n\nincreasing the temperature, the aggregates gradually settle and the result is a clean phase separation of \n\nsolvent and polymer [52]. At the studied surfaces, the equivalent to this \u201ccloudy point\u201d could only be \n\nobserved for this small range of values and the wettability shift is only fully achieved \u2013 and quickly, not \n\ngradually as in solution \u2013 for pH 11 and ionic strength 1.25 M, as is the case at room temperature. \n\nThus, the diagram summarizes the response of the films ending in ELR-RGD as a function of three \n\ndistinct variables, showing an independent and immediate effect of three of the parameters influencing \n\nthe conformation of ELRs. \n\nThe molecular organization of a surface may give valuable information about the physical properties of \n\na substrate. Figure 8.6 shows the surface roughness for the 5\nth\n\n pair of layers assembled in glass, \n\nending in either CHI (layer 9) or ELR-RGD (layer 10), and AFM images of (CHI/ELR-RGD)5 films at \n\nphysiological and transition pH values. An approach similar to that of contact angle measurement was \n\nfollowed: the samples were placed at room temperature in PBS buffered at two distinct pHs \u2013 7.4 and \n\n11 \u2013 and withdrawn for immediate topography image acquisition. We expected that with increasing pH \n\nthe surface roughness would increase as well, due to the triggering mechanism of CHI and ELR-RGD \n\ntransitions above each pKa. The AFM images in Figure 8.6 show the topography changes of (CHI/ELR-\n\nRGD)5 and reveal the formation of large and compact structures upon the aggregation of ELRs at the \n\nsurface \u2013 \u201cmicelle-like\u201d structures which  increases the water affinity at the interface by the exposure of \n\nhydrophilic groups. In fact, such organization is predicted even by the earliest theories of the natural \n\nelastin conformation [53]. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 8.

As a side note, the corresponding contact angle of the (CHI/ELR-\n\nRGD)4CHI films displayed a value of 64.3\u00b13.6\u00ba upon increasing the pH, higher than the value obtained \n\nfor layer 9 due to the deprotonation of CHI. Such result reinforces the fact that the properties of a \n\nmodified surface reflect mainly those of the material present at the interface, as is often expected upon \n\nafter such approach. The effect of pH on roughness was greater when the last layer was composed of \n\nELR-RGD, as evidenced by the higher values displayed at each condition. Such structural changes were \n\nmore visible when the ELR-RGD is deposited as the last layer, since the macromolecular segments \n\nexhibit more degrees of freedom for conformational rearrangements. \u201cpH\u201d and ionic strength may \n\ninfluence the electrostatic interactions between each layer but similar results were obtained for \n\ntemperature changes. We suggest that such similar results evidence that the aggregation of the ELR is \n\nthe factor that contributes the most to the increase of roughness. Similar results were also obtained in \n\nprevious studies [30]. \n\nThe rough character of the surface also contributes to the atypical extreme hydrophilic nature of the \n\nsubstrate, based on a simple lotus effect. In fact, the Wenzel model predicts that the change from a \n\n\n\nChapter 8.

In many cases, it is desirable that the substrate interacts favorably with cells. It has \n\nbeen reported that the RGD sequence is the minimal sequence required for recognition by cell \n\nmembrane integrins, such as ?5?1 and ?V?3 integrins [55-57]. The affinity of cells for materials should \n\nbe improved with the incorporation of a peptide having this sequence. \n\nSo far, we have been able to expand the concept of LbL to a class of materials that is not commonly \n\nused in literature. We also presented results showing that the films display distinct properties for \n\ndifferent conditions of temperature, pH and ionic strength. This feature could be exploited to modulate \n\nprotein and cell adhesion by playing with one of the mentioned stimuli. Unfortunately, the presented \n\ntransition values are simply not suitable for most biological applications. We expect to take advantage \n\non the recombinant nature of ELRs in the near future to produce films that could be triggered at lower \n\nvalues. Nonetheless, the biological performance of the current films was analyzed in order to determine \n\nif this kind of multilayer film is suitable for future tissue engineering devices with good response from \n\ncells, without any hazardous reaction. \n\nIn vitro studies were performed using SaOs-2 osteoblast-like cells. Although other possibilities could be \n\nexplored, one of the uses we envisaged for these coatings is in orthopedic applications in order to \n\nimprove host integration. To prove that the superior cell attachment was due to a specific interaction \n\nwith RGD, the cell behavior was compared to surfaces with a negative control of ELR containing a \n\nscrambled RDG sequence, labeled RDG\n(-)\n\n, in the form of 5 bilayers with CHI, (CHI/ELR-RDG\n(-)\n\n)5. The \n\nscrambled RDG sequence has been previously shown to have significantly less cellular adhesion [58] \n\nand is similar to ELR-RGD in all aspects, except for the position of the G and D aminoacids. \n\nThe SaOs-2 cell viability on ELR-RGD and CHI ending films \u2013 (CHI/ELR-RGD)5 and (CHI/ELR-RGD)4/CHI \n\nrespectively \u2013 was assessed at different time points.

Among the various biological \n\nfunctions of osteoblasts, secretion of ALP is an important indicator determining the activity of the cells. \n\nThe statistical analysis of the data (Figure 8.7b) shows significant differences in SaOs-2 activity adhered \n\nto (CHI/ELR-RGD)5 in comparison to (CHI/ELR-RGD)4/CHI coatings, at 4 h, and (CHI/ELR-RDG\n(-)\n\n)5 and \n\n(CHI/ELR-RGD)4/CHI at 24 h. After 3 days the differences in cell activity become more evident in the \n\nsurface with ELR-RGD in comparison to films ending in ELR-RDG\n(-)\n\n or CHI. \n\nDifferences in the number of cells attached to the different surfaces were also observed, as seen in \n\nFigure 8.8. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 8.

DAPI (blue) and phalloidin (red) staining of the studied cells cultured for distinct times on \n\nthe studied multilayer substrates, ending in CHI, ELR-RGD and ELR-RDG\n(-)\n\n. Tests performed at 4 h, 24 \n\nh, and 3 days. Scale bar: 100 \u00b5m. \n\n \n\nComparing the microscopy images, after 4 h of incubation, ELR-RGD surfaces show a significant \n\nattached number of cells, compared with non-modified surfaces or the negative analog RDG. Based on \n\nthe cell densities of the samples at 24 hours and 3 days, it is possible to verify that (CHI/ELR-RGD)5 \n\ncoatings demonstrated a very significant cell proliferation in comparison to the coatings ending in CHI \n\nand in (RDG)\n(-)\n\n. Besides the higher number of cells on the surfaces with RGD, cells seeded on those \n\nsubstrates spread significantly more than the ones on chitosan or the negative control. Thicker and well \n\norganized filamentous actin bundles were observed in cells growing on RGD surfaces. From our results, \n\nadsorption of ELR-RGD has shown to enhance cell adhesion and activity when compared to the CHI-\n\nending films substrates and the scrambled RDG sequence, showing good in vitro performance of the \n\npresented films. \n\n\n\nChapter 8.

QCM-D results allowed us to study the construction of the polymeric films and its \n\nproperties, showing the buildup of a film with a linear growth. Although glass was used to assemble \n\nsuch coatings, it is expected in the future that such straightforward surface modification technique will \n\nallow us to coat other substrates with more complex geometries, including scaffolds or particles. The \n\nstimuli-responsive properties of the films were extensively studied, showing acute and independent \n\ncyclic response towards temperature, pH and ionic strength; the values of transition for each stimulus \n\nwere identified: 50\u00baC, 11, and 1.25 M, respectively. Below each critical transition point, the surfaces \n\nwere more hydrophobic. Above those, the surface acquired a very hydrophilic character due to the \n\nbiopolymer chain collapse and subsequent exposure of charged residues to the outer region of the \n\ncoating. The transition was also evident in the changes in the topography of the surfaces as we \n\nincreased the pH of the film above the transition values, increasing their roughness due to the \n\naggregation of ELR chains on the top layer. \n\nSaOs-2 osteoblast-like cells were used to test the biological performance of the multilayered system \n\nstudied in vitro of the films. The cells showed increased adhesion and activity with ELR-RGD ending \n\ncoatings, in comparison to the ones ending with both CHI and the non-bioactive ELR-RDG\n(-)\n\n. This work \n\ndemonstrates the potential to use natural and nature-inspired macromolecules to modify surfaces \n\ntaking advantage of a simple layer-by-layer technique, which can be further extrapolated to more \n\ncomplex devices. The potential of this technology can further stimulate the development of other similar \n\nbiomedical products in the near future, such as devices entirely processed through layer-by-layer for the \n\ndelivery of pharmaceuticals, cell culture or structures for tissue engineering. \n\n8.5 Acknowledgements \n\nWe acknowledge the financial support through Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia (FCT) from \n\nPortugal (PhD grants SFRH/BD/61126/2009 and SFRH/BD/61390/2009), the European regional \n\ndevelopment fund (ERDF) from EU, from the MICINN (projects MAT 2007-66275-C02-01, MAT 2007-\n\n61604, MAT 2009-14195-C03-03 and PSE-300100-2006-1), the JCyL (projects VA034A09 and \n\n\n\nChapter 8.

Such need comes at a time \n\nwhen various classes of biomolecules of interest for the treatment of several diseases and the \n\ndevelopment of new biomedical devices are becoming widely available. With this increasing availability, \n\nthe use of smart materials to control the delivery and release of specific agents has followed a similar \n\ntrend. \n\nIdeally, a biomolecule carrier should act as a compartment in which the permeability of a drug to the \n\nexterior can be tuned as this would allow the release rate to be controlled when concerning both \n\ntherapeutics in traditional drug-delivery applications as well as tissue engineering agents that influence \n\nthe proliferation and differentiation of cells. The layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly of macromolecules \u2013 \n\na simple, versatile and inexpensive surface-engineering technique that can be used, under mild \n\nconditions, to encapsulate sensitive active agents and biomaterials by either manipulating the \n\narchitecture of a device or by way of external stimuli \u2013 is an approach with the potential to address this \n\nissue. These \u201ccapsules\u201d could then deliver the encapsulated agents to the target cells by making use of \n\nsimple release mechanisms into the biological environment [6-9] or by digestion of the cells \n\nthemselves [10-13]. Although often applied to flat surfaces, LbL can be used to coat surfaces with \n\ncomplex geometries and shapes and can be extrapolated to three dimensions [14-19]. Hollow \n\nmultilayer capsules are a good example of 3D structures that can act as drug carriers. Inorganic \n\nparticles are typically used as templates for this purpose as they can be chelated under non-aggressive \n\nconditions [20-22]. The use of LbL techniques will therefore ultimately allow control of both the release \n\nprofile of a specific agent and the permeability of the system by varying the materials and number of \n\nlayers in the capsule architecture. \n\nThe concept of post-construction permeability is of great interest for drug-delivery and tissue-engineering \n\napplications as a carrier must be able to retain and preserve the drug but also release it when \n\nnecessary and in a controlled fashion. An ability to switch the permeability of a multilayer capsule \n\nbetween an \u201copen\u201d and a \u201cclosed\u201d state has been demonstrated previously [23-25], but has yet to be \n\nfully validated. Temperature, for example, has been suggested to be a possible mechanism for post-\n\nloading therapeutic agents using temperatures as high as 50 to 70\u00b0C [26-30]. However, such \n\ntemperatures are not suitable for biological applications. Herein we intend to demonstrate the \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Nanostructured and thermoresponsive recombinant biopolymer-based microcapsules for \n\nthe delivery of active molecules \n\n \n\n312 \n\nentrapping properties of self-assembled coatings with varying numbers of nanolayers combined with the \n\nresponse of a biocompatible system towards an external temperature-based stimulus. \n\nIn light of the likely benefits of natural and nature-inspired biomaterials combined with stimuli-\n\nresponsiveness [31,32], we aimed to construct a new generation of therapeutic containers using a \n\nmultilayer approach. Chitosan (CHI) and a biomimetic elastin-like recombinamer (ELR) \u2013 a recombinant \n\nversion of elastin-like polymers (ELPs) \u2013 were used as constituents for the microcapsule shell. CHI is a \n\nwell-known natural material with cationic behavior [33]. whereas ELRs are genetically engineered \n\npolypeptides that mimic natural elastin and exhibit a primary smart response towards temperature. \n\nThese recombinant macromolecules are soluble below a specific critical transition temperature (Tt) in \n\nan aqueous medium, but undergo a phase separation characterized by the dominant presence of \n\nhydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions above it [34-38]. They also allow fine control over the \n\npeptide structure, thus making it possible to introduce motifs with biological relevance, such as cell-\n\nadhesion and mineralization promoters, into their primary valine-proline-glycine-valine-glycine (VPGVG) \n\nsequence [14,39,40]. \n\nThe primary structure of the ELR used herein was designed to present a bioactive behavior by the \n\ninclusion of L-arginine-glycine-L-aspartic acid (RGD) residues, while exploiting the negative aspartic acid \n\nmoieties to enable subsequent self-assembly with chitosan into nanostructured multilayers (schematic \n\nstructure can be found in Supplemental Figure 9.1). The present work focuses on our ability to \n\nconstruct CHI/ELR microcapsules and to use the temperature-responsive nature of ELRs to control the \n\npermeability of engineered multilayer systems. The resulting microcapsules were characterized for their \n\nencapsulation efficiency of a model protein, namely bovine serum albumin (BSA). The permeability of \n\nthe BSA-loaded microcapsules with a varying number of layers was studied at 25 and 37\u00b0C, and the \n\nbiocompatibility of these structures was evaluated in vitro. \n\n9.2 Experimental section \n\n9.2.1 Materials for the microcapsule composition \n\nMedium molecular weight chitosan was purchased from Sigma (reference 448877) and purified by a \n\nseries of filtration and precipitation in water and ethanol steps, followed by freeze-drying. ELR \n\nbioproduction was induced using a fermentation process from an Escherichia coli strain BLR(DE3) \n\ncontaining the appropriate expression gene. Subsequent to fermentation, the culture was harvested and \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Nanostructured and thermoresponsive recombinant biopolymer-based microcapsules for \n\nthe delivery of active molecules \n\n \n\n313 \n\nlysed by ultrasonic disruption. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation and the cleared lysate \n\nwas subjected to several cycles of cold and warm centrifugations. The polymer in solution was stored at \n\n-24\u00b0C and then freeze-dried. The detailed methodology has been described previously [35]. \n\n9.2.2 ELR aggregate-size measurements \n\nELR aggregate size was measured using a Nano-ZS from Malvern (United Kingdom) in the temperature \n\nrange 25\u201337\u00b0C after stabilization for 5 minutes. Samples were prepared at 300 \u00b5g?mL\n-1\n\n in phosphate \n\nbuffer solution (PBS, Sigma reference P4417), pH 7.4. A total of 20 runs were performed for each \n\nsample to obtain a final average value at constant temperature. \n\n9.2.3 Entrapment of BSA in calcium carbonate particles \n\nBSA entrapment was achieved following the method described by She et al. [8]. Thus, to encapsulate 1 \n\nmg of BSA, aqueous solutions of anhydrous sodium carbonate (Na2CO3 granular, ?99.5%, Sigma \n\nreference 222321) and calcium chloride (CaCl2 anhydrous powder Reag. Ph Eur, VWR reference \n\n1.02378.0500) were prepared at 1 M. Co-precipitation of both solutions was performed by adding 100 \n\n\u00b5L of Na2CO3 followed by 100 \u00b5L of CaCl2 to 200 \u00b5L of BSA tagged with fluorescein isothiocyanate \n\n(FITC) (66 kDa, Sigma reference A9771) at 5 mg?mL\n-1\n\n and stirring rapidly for 30 seconds. Stirring was \n\nthen stopped and the suspension of newly synthesized calcium carbonate (CaCO3) microparticles left to \n\nreact and precipitate for 15 min. The supernatant was then removed and the particles washed twice \n\nwith ultrapure water to remove residual salts and non-entrapped protein. Each supernatant was retained \n\nfor fluorescence measurements and determination of entrapment losses. \n\n9.2.4 Construction of the multilayer shells and microcapsule formation \n\nThe CaCO3 sacrificial templates entrapping FITC-BSA were immersed alternately in chitosan and ELR \n\nsolutions [300 \u00b5g?mL\n-1\n\n, pH 5.5, 0.15 M of sodium chloride (NaCl, Reag. Ph Eur, Panreac reference \n\n131659] for 10 min each, then washed with 0.15 M NaCl (pH 5.5). Centrifugation was avoided to avoid \n\ndamage and aggregation of the particles each time the samples were to be retrieved from solution; \n\nsimple precipitation of the suspension was used instead (3 to 5 min). This process was repeated to \n\nincrease the number of bilayers until the desired coating had been obtained (1, 3 and 5 bilayers). After \n\nconstruction, the CaCO3 core was removed by chelation with ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Nanostructured and thermoresponsive recombinant biopolymer-based microcapsules for \n\nthe delivery of active molecules \n\n \n\n314 \n\npowder, ACS reagent, 99.4\u2013100.6%, Sigma reference E9884; 0.2 M, pH 5.5). Each supernatant and \n\nsolution was retained for fluorescence measurements and determination of losses during the \n\nconstruction and chelation stages. \n\n9.2.5 Determination of pre-loading encapsulation efficiency \n\nFluorescence measurements were performed using a Synergie HT microplate ELISA reader (BioTek, \n\nUSA). Thus, 150 ?L of sample was pipetted into a white, opaque 96-well plate in triplicate. Distilled \n\nwater was used as blank. The excitation (?exc) and emission (?em) wavelengths used for the calibration \n\ncurve and FITC-BSA mass calculations were 485 and 528 nm, respectively. All supernatants collected \n\nduring entrapment, construction and chelation were measured and quantified. The percentage of \n\nfluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-BSA mass lost was plotted both for each stage and cumulatively. The \n\nencapsulation efficiency was calculated by subtracting the cumulative losses of each architecture from \n\nthe initial FITC-BSA mass. \n\n9.2.6 In vitro biological performance \n\nA murine fibroblast cell line (L929, European Collection of Cell Cultures) was used for the biological \n\nassays. Thus, L929 cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, Invitrogen \n\nreference 42400-028) with phenol red supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen, \n\nreference 10270-106) and 1% antibiotic/antimicotic (Gibco reference 15240062) in a humidified \n\natmosphere with 5% carbon dioxide (CO2) at 37\u00b0C. For the cell viability test, 2\u00d710\n3\n cells were seeded \n\non 48-well plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. After 24 hours, microcapsules were added to the \n\nculture medium in a ratio of 40 microcapsules per cell. After each culturing period, samples were \n\nwashed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). A 250 ?L aliquot of fetal bovine serum (FBS)-free \n\nculture medium and 50 ?L of (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-\n\n2H-tetrazolium) (MTS) reagent were added to each well. A cell-free well was used as control. Plates \n\nwere incubated for 3 h at 37\u00baC, 5% CO2, protected from light. After incubation, 100 ?L of this solution \n\nwas transferred to a 96-well plate and the plate read using a Synergie HT microplate ELISA reader \n\n(BioTek, USA) in 490 nm absorbance mode. \n\nVisualization of the actin cytoskeleton was performed using (tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate)-\n\nphalloidin (TRITC-phalloidin, Sigma reference P1951). After each culture period, samples were washed \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Nanostructured and thermoresponsive recombinant biopolymer-based microcapsules for \n\nthe delivery of active molecules \n\n \n\n315 \n\ntwice with PBS and fixed with 4% formalin in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After fixation, cells \n\nwere incubated with TRITC-phalloidin (10 ?g?mL\n-1\n\n) for 45 min and washed three times with PBS. To \n\nstain the nucleus, the cells were incubated with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma reference \n\nD9564) (1 ?g?mL\n-1\n\n) for 5 min then washed with PBS. Cells were observed under an Axioimager Z1M \n\nZeiss fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Germany). \n\n9.2.7 Quantification of FITC-BSA release \n\nThe microcapsules were resuspended in PBS at either 25 or 37\u00b0C. The upper limit of five bilayers for \n\nthe microcapsule architecture was chosen to study the effect of temperature along with small changes \n\nin the number of different layers. This study was conducted over 14 days, removing the surrounding \n\nPBS from each container every 24 h. An additional sample was taken after 12 h from the start of the \n\nstudy. PBS was fully refreshed at each time point, and 100% BSA was considered to be the total mass \n\nremaining in the microcapsules after their construction. The release experiments were performed under \n\nmild agitation to improve the diffusion of BSA through the incubating medium. All experiments were \n\nperformed in triplicate (n=3), with each sample containing the number of capsules resulting from the \n\nattempted encapsulation of 1 mg of BSA. To determine the type of release profile for each condition, \n\nthe release kinetics were determined using the Korsmeyer kinetic model (equation 9.1): \n\nn\nKt/M\n\nt\nM ?\n\n?\n (9.1) \n\nwhere Mt /M? is the fraction of protein released at time t, K is the rate constant for the Korsmeyer \n\nmodel, and n is the exponent that characterizes the release mechanism [41]. The Korsmeyer model is \n\nused when the release mechanism from a swellable polymeric device is not well-known or when more \n\nthan one type of release phenomenon could be involved. The fitting was performed for all architectures \n\nand for each temperature. \n\n9.2.8 Microscopy characterization of the CaCO3 microparticles and multilayered \n\nmicrocapsules \n\nA Leica Cambridge S360 scanning electron microscope (United Kingdom) was used to evaluate the \n\nmorphology of the sacrificial templates. Specimens were pre-coated with a conductive layer of sputtered \n\ngold and micrographs recorded at 10 kV. An Olympus FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope \n\n(CLSM, Germany) was used to evaluate the morphology of (CHI/ELR)5 microcapsules loaded with FITC-\n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Nanostructured and thermoresponsive recombinant biopolymer-based microcapsules for \n\nthe delivery of active molecules \n\n \n\n316 \n\nBSA. A final layer consisting of a cationic dye (rhodamine B, 10\n-6\n\n M) was further adsorbed. All samples \n\nwere stabilized at either 25 or 37\u00b0C and observed under hydrated conditions. \n\n9.3 Results \n\nIn order to evaluate the thermal response of the featured ELR, the size variations of peptide aggregates \n\nin aqueous solution were measured as a function of temperature. The results, which are plotted in \n\nFigure 9.1, show an increase in aggregate size from around 10 to 3000 nm in aqueous PBS solution. \n\nThis variation occurs at a Tt of 29\u00b0C and is accompanied by an increase in solution turbidity, thus \n\nshowing that this ELR possesses a Tt in solution above the working room temperature and below the \n\nphysiological one of 37\u00b0C. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9.1.

Insets show a transparent solution below \n\n29\u00b0C and increased turbidity above it. \n\n \n\nCaCO3 particles were prepared by co-precipitation of Na2CO3 and CaCl2 solutions under vigorous \n\nstirring in a BSA medium and subsequently tagged with FITC. The resulting inorganic particles, with a \n\ndiameter of around 5-6 \u00b5m (Figure 9.2A), were used as BSA-containing sacrificial templates for the \n\nalternating incubation with aqueous chitosan and ELR solutions. After construction, the core was \n\nchelated with EDTA to form hollow microcapsules, as confirmed by CLSM Figure 9.2B). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Nanostructured and thermoresponsive recombinant biopolymer-based microcapsules for \n\nthe delivery of active molecules \n\n \n\n317 \n\n \n\nFigure 9.2.

(C) A graphic showing the stage losses measured \n\nduring construction of the microcapsules. Data represent mean\u00b1SD (n=3; *p<0.05). \n\n \n\nStructures with one, three and five bilayers, henceforth referred to as (CHI/ELR)1, (CHI/ELR)3 and \n\n(CHI/ELR)5, were constructed to study the effects of capsule architecture on the subsequent release of \n\nBSA at 25 and 37\u00b0C. In order to determine the total encapsulation efficiency, the fluorescence of each \n\nsupernatant was measured at each stage and the losses calculated with respect to the initial FITC-BSA \n\ncontent in the precipitation medium (1 mg). Although a loss of 9% was registered during the entrapment \n\nstage (Figure 9.2C), losses during the construction stage were higher for capsules with fewer layers. \n\nThe effect of the shell architecture became more evident during the chelation stage, with our \n\nobservations showing a \u201cburst-release\u201d of 13% for (CHI/ELR)1 and 10% for (CHI/ELR)5. \n\nCLSM images of (Chi/ELR)5 microcapsules at 25 and 37 \u00b0C are shown in Figure 3. The capsules are \n\nsignificantly smaller at 37 \u00b0C (Figure 9.3B, 3.21\u00b10.63 \u00b5m) than at 25 \u00b0C (Figure 9.3A, 5.51\u00b10.56 \n\n\u00b5m), most probably due to a layer rearrangement as a result of the effect of different solvent \n\ntemperatures on the stimuli-responsive ELR molecules. \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Nanostructured and thermoresponsive recombinant biopolymer-based microcapsules for \n\nthe delivery of active molecules \n\n \n\n318 \n\n \n\nFigure 9.3.

The \n\nnormal distribution approximation, which fits a 95% confidence interval, is depicted. \n\n \n\nThe cytotoxicity of these microcapsules was determined to ascertain whether they could be used in \n\nbiological systems. Thus, an in vitro biological evaluation was carried out using the L929 mouse \n\nfibroblast cell line. The cell viability was assessed by MTS after culture in a microcapsule-containing \n\nmedium (either loaded with BSA or unloaded). The graphic in Figure 9.4A shows a quantitative \n\ncomparison with the lone L929 control and confirms that the cells cultured in the presence of \n\n(CHI/ELR)5 retained their viability at every time-point (24 h, 3 days and 7 days). Furthermore, \n\nfluorescence microscopy of cells cultured in the absence (Figure 9.4B) and presence (Figure 9.4C) of \n\nBSA-loaded (CHI/ELR)5 microcapsules confirmed that the cell morphology remained unchanged when \n\nin contact with the microcapsules. This was the case for both BSA-loaded and -free microcapsules. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Nanostructured and thermoresponsive recombinant biopolymer-based microcapsules for \n\nthe delivery of active molecules \n\n \n\n319 \n\n24h 3d 7d\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n (Chi/ELR)\n5\n\n L929\n\nC\ne\nll\n v\n\nia\nb\nil\nit\ny\n (\n\n%\n o\n\nf \nc\no\nn\ntr\n\no\nl)\n\n Empty (Chi/ELR)\n5\n\n(A)\n(B)\n\n(C)\n\n \n\nFigure 9.4.

Scale bar: 50 \u00b5m. \n\n \n\nThe ability to retain an active agent and protect it until delivery is one of the most important features of \n\na drug-delivery system. Our results showed BSA retentions of greater than 70% of the initial 1 mg after \n\nconstruction of the microcapsules, with cumulative losses of 28%, 26% and 25% for (Chi/ELR)1, \n\n(CHI/ELR)3 and (CHI/ELR)5, respectively (see Figure 9.2C for stage losses, and Supplemental Figure \n\n9.3 and Supplemental Table 9.1 for detailed cumulative calculations). However, an ability to release this \n\nactive agent in a controlled manner after encapsulation is equally important. As such, the influence of \n\nthe total number of layers and temperature on the release profile of BSA from the capsules was \n\ninvestigated. BSA release at different temperatures was studied over a period of 14 days, and the \n\ncumulative release profiles for (CHI/ELR)1, (CHI/ELR)3 and (CHI/ELR)5 capsules loaded with BSA at \n\nroom (25\u00b0C) and physiological temperatures (37\u00b0C) can be seen in Figure 9.5. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Nanostructured and thermoresponsive recombinant biopolymer-based microcapsules for \n\nthe delivery of active molecules \n\n \n\n320 \n\n   \n\nFigure 9.5. Cumulative release of BSA from (CHI/ELR)1, (CHI/ELR)3 and (CHI/ELR)5 microcapsules: \n\n??, ??, and ??, respectively, in PBS (pH 7.4), at (A) 25\u00b0C and (B) 37\u00b0C. \n\n \n\nDuring this sub-study, 100% of BSA was considered to be the total mass remaining in the \n\nmicrocapsules after their construction. The estimated number of microcapsules in each tested sample \n\nwas approximately 8\u00d710\n8\n, as calculated by dividing the volume occupied by the precipitated \n\nmicrocapsules (around 70 ?L) and the volume occupied by a single microcapsule (diameter of \n\n5.51 ?m), disregarding the empty spaces between them. PBS was fully refreshed at each time point, in \n\norder to simulate a biological environment in which the delivered therapeutic agent is taken up by the \n\ntargeted cells. Irrespective of the temperature and number of layers, an initial analysis of the profiles \n\nshows that BSA release is sustained over the period studied, with a visible absence of significant burst \n\nrelease at the initial time-points. The release kinetics were markedly influenced by the temperature (see \n\nrate constants, K, in Table 9.1), with smaller quantities of released FITC-BSA being detected from \n\nmicrocapsules incubated at 37\u00b0C. In the case of the more permeable (CHI/ELR)1 capsules, these \n\nstructures showed a cumulative release of 79% at 25\u00b0C after 14 days in PBS, while a value of 52% was \n\nobtained at 37\u00b0C. The same trend was observed for (CHI/ELR)3 and (CHI/ELR)5. \n\nRelease was also dependent on the number of layers in the capsule architecture. Thus, irrespective of \n\nthe temperature, more layers resulted in greater BSA retention. This finding confirms the shell\u2019s ability \n\nto act as a tunable barrier against the diffusion of an encapsulated agent. The Fickian or non-Fickian \n\nrelease behavior of BSA was given by the exponent of the Korsmeyer kinetics model, n, shown in Table \n\n9.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Nanostructured and thermoresponsive recombinant biopolymer-based microcapsules for \n\nthe delivery of active molecules \n\n \n\n321 \n\nTable 9.1.

The data for capsules incubated at \n\n25\u00b0C fit an anomalous (non-Fickian) mode of diffusion (n > 0.43), thus suggesting a combination of \n\npure protein diffusion and shell relaxation/swelling mechanisms under these conditions. The \n\n(CHI/ELR)5 capsules were an exception to this, with a Fickian mode of diffusion (n &lt;0.43). The \n\ncapsules also follow a Fickian diffusion model at 37\u00b0C. In comparison to the capsules at 25\u00b0C, a pure \n\ndiffusion mechanism occurs under physiological conditions. This effect results from the restructuration \n\nof the film which occurs upon deposition of each additional layer [42]. The result is a more densely \n\npacked multilayer structure with decreasing polymeric mobility and no anomalous relaxation/swelling \n\nmechanism, together with a more compact and stable shell. \n\n9.4 Discussion \n\nThe development of drug-delivery systems that can encapsulate, protect and deliver a therapeutic \n\nmolecule or growth factor in a controlled fashion is of major importance for both current healthcare \n\napplications and in the fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Herein we have exploited \n\ntemperature and the smart response of ELRs as an actual drug-release mechanism for a pre-\n\nencapsulated model protein. Furthermore, our aim was to develop a system that is able to respond at a \n\ntemperature which will be useful for future applications in human biological studies. \n\nWe have conceived and developed biocompatible thermoresponsive microcapsules by taking advantage \n\nof the self-assembly properties of chitosan and an ELR using a multilayer approach. The fact that the \n\nmajority of LbL studies performed to date have involved conventional polyelectrolytes has hindered the \n\nextrapolation of this technology to systems exhibiting other capabilities and complexities, including those \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Nanostructured and thermoresponsive recombinant biopolymer-based microcapsules for \n\nthe delivery of active molecules \n\n \n\n322 \n\nthat could respond to external stimuli. We have previously demonstrated that, unlike most conventional \n\nmultilayer combinations, combining these two materials is more favorable when both electrostatic and \n\nhydrophobic interactions are exploited, thus allowing for the construction of films as thin as 40 nm \n\n(considering a total of five bilayers) [43]. This is feasible if construction is performed under conditions \n\nclose to the pKa of the polysaccharide, where both protonated and deprotonated groups can be used. \n\nOur results, especially those observed in CLSM (Figure 9.2B and Figure 9.3), demonstrate that it is \n\npossible to extrapolate this technology from 2D to 3D and to construct micrometric devices using a non-\n\nconventional combination of polymers. \n\nIn order to determine the pre-encapsulation efficiency (see Figure 9.2C), all three construction stages \n\nwere screened for each architecture [(CHI/ELR)1, (CHI/ELR)3 and (CHI/ELR)5]. There was no \n\ndifference between any of the cases studied during the entrapment stage. Note that at this stage the \n\nshell has not yet been assembled, thus meaning that the encapsulation efficiency is solely dependent \n\non the protein/CaCO3 interaction, which at this point in the process is common for all groups. In the \n\nfollowing construction stage, and in contrast to our expectations, the losses were higher for thinner \n\ncapsules. As more adsorption steps and manipulation are involved as construction proceeds, we \n\nexpected to find higher protein losses for (CHI/ELR)5 microcapsules since BSA should diffuse \n\ncontinuously from the sacrificial core, even if only in insignificant quantities. The explanation for our \n\nfinding may reside in the fact that the protein lost to the polymer incubation solutions may be retaken \n\nup during the addition of subsequent layers to the shell. Indeed, using CLSM we were able to identify a \n\nhigh concentration of FITC-BSA near the capsule shell (see Figure 9.2B). As for the chelation stage, \n\nalthough there is a statistically significant difference between (CHI/ELR)1 and (CHI/ELR)3, the \n\nnumerical difference is not meaningful (12.7% vs. 11.3%, respectively). Thicker capsules are also able \n\nto retain more protein than those with a lower number of bilayers since multilayer shells can act as \n\nbarriers that hinder the diffusion of molecules from the inner cavity to the surrounding medium [8]. \n\nThe microcapsules described herein have been shown to undergo temperature-dependent size \n\nvariations, with two possible shrinkage mechanisms explaining the shrinkage observed upon increasing \n\nthe temperature. Thus, as discussed previously, the ELR collapses to a more ordered, self-assembled \n\nstate upon increasing temperature above Tt [35-37], although it is also likely that shrinkage is further \n\namplified by a thermodynamic rearrangement of the layers. Such a rearrangement is driven by the \n\ntendency of shells with an even number of layers (1:1 ratio of electrostatic forces) to minimize the \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Nanostructured and thermoresponsive recombinant biopolymer-based microcapsules for \n\nthe delivery of active molecules \n\n \n\n323 \n\nshell/water interface [30]. This is the same mechanism used for post-loading procedures, which have \n\nbeen reported to take place at typical temperatures in the range 50\u201370\u00b0C [27-30]. \n\nDespite the fact that such structures have been reported to respond to temperature changes, this has \n\nonly been applied as a means to post-encapsulate molecules within pre-formed microcapsules. \n\nHowever, other than the exploitation of post-encapsulation procedures, the temperatures required for \n\nthis are not suitable for biological applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that \n\nsuch a significant size reduction has been observed at temperatures as low as 37\u00b0C. For example, \n\nusing oppositely charged copolymers of poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) \n\n(PAH) with poly(N -isoproprylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm), Glinel et al. [27] have reported a size reduction of \n\nonly 15% at 60 \u00b0C, whereas the present work shows a reduction of 42% at 37\u00b0C. Furthermore, these \n\nmicrocapsules retain a temperature response over a relevant temperature range and the changes occur \n\nunder physiological conditions, similar to what has been demonstrated for the ELR in solution (Figure \n\n9.1). These results allow us to anticipate future applications in the field of biomedicine in areas such as \n\ndrug delivery, cell/tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. \n\nIn order to be used in biomedicine, it was important to assess whether the microcapsules and their \n\ncontent were harmful to cells. The biological performance in vitro is presented in Figure 9.4. This study \n\nshowed that the viability of L929 cells in contact with the capsules (loaded and unloaded) was \n\ncomparable to those used as positive control. The morphology of lone L929 cells and cells in contact \n\nwith loaded (CHI/ELR)5 microcapsules was also similar. These results show that these structures are \n\nnon-cytotoxic towards L929 cells and can therefore be safely used in biomedical applications. Such \n\napplications could include the simple release of a biomolecule from a drug release device, with the \n\nmicrocapsules being compacted to form a tablet that can be administered orally. Since these \n\nmicrocapsules are highly retentive at physiological temperatures, they could release specific active \n\nagents in quantities within a therapeutic time window. Further possibilities include transcutaneous \n\nvaccines for the delivery of biomolecules into the skin, and the local application or injection of \n\nmicrocapsules loaded with growth factors at a defect site in a tissue or organ to facilitate its \n\nregeneration. This site could also be a tumor, with low molecular weight anti-cancer drugs being loaded \n\ninto these reservoirs to kill tumor cells [44]. It should be noted that the temperature at tumor sites is \n\nusually slightly higher than 37\u00b0C and hyperthermic treatments are used to further increase the \n\ntemperature locally. For the specific use of these microcapsules in cancer treatments, experiments at \n\nslightly higher temperatures (e.g., up to 42\u00b0C) using low molecular weight molecules (most \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Nanostructured and thermoresponsive recombinant biopolymer-based microcapsules for \n\nthe delivery of active molecules \n\n \n\n324 \n\nchemotherapeutic drugs have low molecular weights) should be performed in the future. Growth factors, \n\nwhich tend to have a higher molecular weight than chemotherapeutic agents, are also of interest for \n\ntissue-engineering applications, where they could be used in vitro to control cell metabolism and \n\nproliferation and to trigger stem cell differentiation. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, around 40 \n\nkDa), for example, has shown great potential in angiogenesis, one of the most relevant mechanisms in \n\ntissue-engineering applications. Similarly, human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF, around 20-30 \n\nkDa) is one of the most active factors in cell migration and differentiation. However, the success of \n\nthese growth factors in therapeutic applications often requires a spatiotemporal controlled-release \n\nsystem for delivery [45]. This could be achieved by diffusion of the encapsulated load into the medium \n\nand by internalization of individual capsules by the cells. The latter case would require the cells \n\nconcerned to be larger than the individual microcapsules. We did not observe the uptake of capsules by \n\nL929 cells in this study, most probably because the size difference between L929 (around 5 to 10 \u00b5m) \n\nand microcapsules at 37\u00b0C (3.21\u00b10.63 \u00b5m, Figure 9.3B) is too small for such a phenomenon to occur. \n\nIn contrast, some stem cells, such as adipose stem cells, may reach 50 \u00b5m, thus meaning that \n\napplications which envisage their differentiation may be exploited in the future using this kind of \n\nmicrometric device. \n\nFigure 9.5 shows the BSA-release properties of microcapsules with different numbers of layers at \n\ndistinct temperatures, together with the Korsmeyer model fitting parameters calculated in Table 9.1. It \n\nshould be noted that these systems were not designed to operate in an \u201con/off\u201d basis, such as when \n\nexploiting a temperature-dependent post-loading approach, but rather to achieve distinct release profiles \n\nthat could prove to be useful for the sustained release of molecules in the body or in vitro. \n\nThe permeability of BSA to the exterior was easily tuned by varying the number of layers. Thus, similarly \n\nto the chelation stage during construction, the multilayer shell was able to act as a more effective \n\nbarrier as the number of layers in it increased, thus allowing for a more sustained release and retentive \n\nmicrocapsule. The results obtained at 25 and 37\u00b0C were also interesting as the capsules proved to be \n\nmore retentive at the latter. These results relate well with the size variations observed in Figure 9.3: the \n\nthermoresponsive effect of the CHI/ELR microcapsules results in a reduction in both their size and their \n\npermeability, thus making them more retentive. It is notable that, regardless of the test conditions, \n\n100% of the BSA contained in the microcapsules was not released, most likely due to an interaction \n\nbetween the protein and the nanostructured shell. It is possible that a combination with enzymatic \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \u2013 Nanostructured and thermoresponsive recombinant biopolymer-based microcapsules for \n\nthe delivery of active molecules \n\n \n\n325 \n\ndegradation, a mechanism which has been used previously [6,46,47], could lead to total release of the \n\nload. However, such a study was outside the scope of this work. \n\n9.5 Conclusion \n\nIn summary, size and permeability variations have been achieved by exploiting the temperature \n\nresponse of the ELR, which is amplified by a thermodynamic rearrangement of the multilayer structure \n\nat the molecular level. The use of different numbers of layers has allowed the permeability of the shells \n\nto be tuned, thus resulting in distinct release profiles for each architecture tested. We envisage the \n\nexploitation of these properties at physiological temperature for applications where a long-term release \n\nwith low initial drug burst is desired. Similarly, the degradation mechanisms of a cellular environment \n\ncan be simulated to release an active agent completely over the appropriate time period. Due to \n\nmicrometric size of these capsules, delivering small quantities of growth factors or differentiation agents \n\ndirectly to the cells by digestion is envisaged. The genetically encoded nature of ELRs offers the \n\npossibility to engineer molecules containing biologically relevant motifs that could be recognized by \n\nspecific cells, such as the present case of RGD inclusion. All these possibilities, together with their non-\n\ncytotoxic character, make these microcapsules a promising alternative for more highly effective drug \n\ndelivery and tissue engineering. \n\n9.6 Supplemental information \n\n9.6.1 Schematic structure of the ELR \n\n \n\n2\n\nMGKKKP (VPGVG)14 {(VPGIG)10 (AVTGRGDSPASS) (VPGIG)10}2 (VPGVG)14 V\n \n\nSupplemental Figure 9.1.

In particular, the use of nanostructured nano- and \n\nmicro-capsules made using layer-by-layer (LbL) strategies has been studied as a method to encapsulate \n\nand deliver drugs in a controlled manner [4-8]. The principle behind LbL adsorption lies in the existence \n\nof intermolecular interactions attracting distinct polymer chains, such as electrostatic contacts, \n\nhydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bonding, which drive the assembly of layers with only a few \n\nnanometers onto a surface [9-11]. With this simple and versatile technique, robust coatings can be \n\nassembled into bidimensional templates and even complex three-dimensional substrates. For instance, \n\nspherical nanostructured microcapsules have been conceived resorting to sacrificial silica (with 500 nm \n\nto 5 \u00b5m, dissolved in hydrogen fluoride) and porous calcium carbonate particles (with 3 to 5 \u00b5m, \n\ndissolved in ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, EDTA) [12]. These structures have already been found to \n\nbe useful as drug carriers \u2013 including of stem cell differentiation promoters \u2013 with release kinetics \n\ndependent on the number of layers or external stimuli, and as biosensors [13-15]. \n\nMultilayer microcapsules may encapsulate and deliver bioactive agents to cells or tissues following \n\nconventional release mechanisms to the biological environment [16] or by digestion within the cells \n\nthemselves [17]. The latter possibility is particularly interesting: by delivering an active agent directly to \n\nthe cells, where the whole metabolic machinery is found, high drug concentrations could be made \n\navailable to the targeted tissue using minimal cargo amounts during its encapsulation. Moreover, it \n\ncould also be possible to circumvent undesirable side effects to circumventing tissues or cells due to \n\npremature drug leakage. \n\nCarriers such as dendrimers, micelles and biodegradable nanoparticles have been frequently developed \n\nfor the intracellular delivery of bioactive agents [18-21]. As carriers, multilayer-coated capsules present \n\nseveral advantages that are not often found together in other conventional fabrication techniques: (i) \n\nthey can be prepared under mild conditions, what makes it possible for large amounts of sensitive or \n\neasily denatured biological molecules [22] and even cells [23] to be encapsulated, (ii) it is possible to \n\nencapsulate drugs with low water solubility [5], (iii) they allow controlling better the release kinetics by \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 Cellular uptake of multilayered capsules produced with biomimetic and genetically \n\nengineered macromolecules \n\n \n\n340 \n\nvarying the number of layers and their composition [24], and (iv) the shell can provide a high degree of \n\nfunctionality by selecting biofunctional constituents that may participate in biological mechanisms [25]. \n\nThe primary objective of the present work is the design of multilayer microcapsules made of natural and \n\nnature-inspired macromolecules exhibiting bioactive sequences for intracellular drug delivery. Namely, \n\nchitosan (CHI) and elastin-like recombinamers (ELRs) were used as constituents of the multilayer shells \n\nwhich were assembled onto spherical particles of calcium carbonate. CHI is a well-known polycationic \n\npolysaccharide of marine origin which shows biocompatibility, adhesiveness and nontoxicity, as well as \n\nbacteriostatic, fungistatic, anti-microbial and hemostatic activities [26]. ELRs, a recombinant type of \n\nelastin-like polymers (ELP), are temperature-responsive and biomimetic polypeptides that are soluble in \n\naqueous media below a specific critical transition temperature (Tt) but undergo a phase separation \n\nabove it [27]. Their recombinant and modular nature is most likely their most attractive property \n\nbecause it allows tuning their physicochemical properties and introducing selected relevant amino acid \n\ndomains to extend their physiological functionality [28,29]. LbL adsorption can be exploited using ELRs \n\nalongside polysaccharides, such as CHI and alginate, by taking advantage of strong electrostatic \n\ninteractions and the stabilizing effect of weaker hydrophobic interactions [30]. \n\nHerein, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were incubated with ELR-functionalized \n\nmicrocapsules with the cell adhesion motif arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD). The inclusion of the \n\nloop RGD motif of the human structural protein fibronectin in the primary structure of the ELR was \n\nexpected to add bioactive character to the microcapsules, while exploiting the negatively charged \n\naspartic acids to enable the electrostatic self-assembly mechanism with CHI to occur. It has been \n\nreported that the RGD sequence is the minimal sequence required for recognition by the cell adhesion \n\nreceptor integrins [31].  It is also known that nano/micro-particles modified with RGD show enhanced \n\ninternalization [32-34]. However, this comparison is often made with unmodified  controls, that is, do \n\nnot undergo any functionalization. Therefore, in addition to RGD, we also constructed microcapsules \n\nfunctionalized with an ELR containing a nonfunctional scrambled RDG sequence. To our knowledge, this \n\nis the first time that the internalization efficacy of RGD-functionalized LbL microcapsules is compared \n\nwith a microcapsule type that substitutes the bioactive group with a nonfunctional analogue, similar in \n\nevery aspect except for the position of the G and D residues, instead of removing it. \n\nThe resulting microcapsules will be characterized in terms of morphology, and cytotoxicity after \n\nincubation with hMSCs. The internalization efficacy of the microcapsules will be quantified by flow \n\ncytometry in order to identify the existence \u2013 or absence \u2013 of a receptor-mediated uptake and \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 Cellular uptake of multilayered capsules produced with biomimetic and genetically \n\nengineered macromolecules \n\n \n\n341 \n\nconsequent influence in the intracellular processing between each microcapsule type. Furthermore, \n\nCapsules loaded with DQ-ovalbumin will permit to follow the availability of this protein inside the cells by \n\nmonitoring the fluorescence changes of the capsules. \n\n10.2 Experimental section \n\n10.2.1 Materials \n\nMedium molecular weight chitosan (ref 448877), sodium carbonate anhydrous (Na2CO3, ref 222321) \n\nand EDTA (ref E9884) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Chitosan was further submitted to a \n\npurification stage consisting in a series of filtration and precipitation in water and ethanol steps, adapted \n\nfrom the method described elsewhere [30], followed by freeze-drying. The final degree of deacetylation \n\nwas determined to be 82% by \n1\nH-NMR. Calcium chloride (CaCl2) was purchased from VWR (ref \n\n1.02378.0500). Two custom-made ELRs containing either a RGD or RDG sequence \u2013 henceforth \n\nreferred to as ELR-RGD and ELR-RDG\n(-)\n\n, respectively \u2013 were purchased from Technical Protein \n\nNanobiotechnology (Spain). The characterization of the molecular weight and amino acid composition of \n\nthe acquired batches were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass \n\nspectroscopy (MALDI-TOF) and amino acid content analysis, respectively, and can be found \n\nelsewhere [25]. DQ-ovalbumin (ref D12053) was obtained from Invitrogen. \n\nParaformaldehyde (ref P6148), Triton X-100 (ref T9284) and Accutase\nTM\n\n (ref A6964) were purchased \n\nfrom Sigma-Aldrich. Human mesenchymal stem cells from human adipose tissue, (hMSCs, ref R7788-\n\n115) its basal medium, Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, ref 31966-021), fetal bovine \n\nserum (FBS, ref 16000-044), penicillin streptomycin solution (ref SV30010), trypsin-ethylenediamine \n\ntetraacetic acid (EDTA, ref SV30010), Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS, ref 14190-136), \n\n4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES, ref 15630049), Trypan Blue stain 0.4% (ref \n\n15250061), Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (ref A12379), LIVE/DEAD\n\u00ae\n Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit, for \n\nmammalian cells (ref L3224), Alamar Blue\n\u00ae\n (ref DAL1025) and DAPI (ref D21490) were supplied by  \n\nInvitrogen . All cell culture plastic-ware and consumables were acquired from NUNC. \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 Cellular uptake of multilayered capsules produced with biomimetic and genetically \n\nengineered macromolecules \n\n \n\n342 \n\n10.2.2 Measurement of the charges \n\nThe ?-potentials of the ELRs were determined using a Nano-ZS equipment from Malvern (United \n\nKingdom), at 25\u00baC. Aqueous solutions of each ingredient in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH = 7.4) \n\nwere used, at a concentration of 300 ?g?mL\n-1\n\n. \n\n10.2.3 Synthesis of calcium carbonate sacrificial templates \n\nAqueous solutions Na2CO3 and CaCl2 were prepared at a concentration of 1 M. Typically, the \n\ncoprecipitation of both solutions was performed by adding 1 mL of Na2CO3 solution followed by 1 mL of \n\nCaCl2 to 4 mL of ultrapure water (Milli-Q) under heavy stirring for 30 s. The stirring was then stopped \n\nand the suspension of the newly synthesized calcium carbonate (CaCO3) microparticles was left to \n\nprecipitate and react for 15 min. The supernatant was removed and the particles were washed three \n\ntimes with 0.15 M sodium chloride (NaCl) adjusted to pH 5.5. To produce microcapsules preloaded \n\nwith a protein cargo, the medium where the precipitation occurs consisted of an aqueous solution of \n\nDQ-ovalbumin at a concentration of 160 ?g?mL\n-1\n\n. Unless otherwise stated, all changes of solutions \n\nduring the template synthesis and construction of microcapsules were performed by leaving the particle \n\nsuspension precipitating for 10 min, followed by removal of the supernatant and replacement with the \n\nnext solution \u2013 polymeric or for washing. \n\n10.2.4 Construction of the multilayer shells and microcapsule formation \n\nThe CaCO3 sacrificial templates were immersed alternately in solutions of CHI and one of the ELRs \n\n(300 \u00b5g?mL\n-1\n\n, pH 5.5, 0.15 M NaCl) for 10 min under mild stirring. Each adsorption step was followed \n\nby three washing steps with 0.15 M NaCl, pH 5.5: to disaggregate the substrates, the first was \n\naccompanied by four sequential ultrasound pulses of 3 seconds each, with the following being just \n\nrinsed. This process was repeated until 2 CHI/ELR bilayers were assembled. After the construction of \n\nthe multilayers, the CaCO3 core was dissolved by EDTA, at 0.2 M, pH 5.5. From this point on, the \n\nprecipitation of the microcapsules was aided by centrifugation steps (1000 rpm, 25 min) and \n\nultrasound pulses timed as described above. The newly formed hollow microcapsules then followed a \n\nwashing procedure with EDTA (0.2 M, pH 7.4) and four with ultrapure water. The microcapsules were \n\nstored at room temperature until use for a maximum of 24 h in a renewed medium of ultrapure water. \n\nIn the case of microcapsules intended for cellular assays \u2013 loaded with DQ-ovalbumin \u2013 DMEM was \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 Cellular uptake of multilayered capsules produced with biomimetic and genetically \n\nengineered macromolecules \n\n \n\n343 \n\nused for the washings and storage instead of water. The microcapsule production yield resulting from \n\nthe mixture of 1 mL of Na2CO3 and CaCl2 was estimated to be with a total of 1.1\u00d710\n6\n microcapsules \n\nby microscopy observation. \n\n10.2.5 Characterization of the hybrid microcapsules \n\nThe morphology of the produced microcapsules \u2013 designated (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 and (CHI/ELR-RDG\n(-)\n\n)2 \u2013 \n\nwas determined using an environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) (FEI Quanta 200FEG). A \n\nnumber of 2.2\u00d710\n4\n microcapsules suspended in 200 ?L of H2O was placed on top of a silicon wafer \n\n(1 cm\n2\n) and dried overnight at 37\u00baC before the analysis. The samples were placed inside the \n\nequipment in a platform with a 20\u00ba tilt. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained \n\nusing a JEOL JEM-1011 HR instrument operating at 80 kV. Prior to the observation, a number of 10\n4\n \n\nmicrocapsules suspended in 60 ?L of H2O was pipetted onto a TEM grid and left to dry overnight at \n\nroom temperature. A confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM, Olympus FV1000, Germany) was \n\nused to evaluate the morphology of the microcapsules. For this, a final solution of a cationic dye \n\n(rhodamine B, 10\n-6\n\n M) was further adsorbed after the normal construction of the microcapsules. All \n\nsamples were stabilized at 37\u00b0C and observed under hydrated conditions. The fluorescence intensity \n\nprofiles of 3 distinct microcapsules were plotted using ImageJ software (to assess the formation of \n\nspherical hollow structures (provided by NIH, version 1.47v). \n\n10.2.6 Cell culture \n\nhMSCs were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U?mL\n-1\n\n penicillin, 0.1 mg?mL\n-1\n\n \n\nstreptomycin replaced every two day and maintained at 37\u00baC in a 5% carbon dioxide (CO2) humidified \n\nenvironmental chamber. Near-confluence cells (passages 2\u20136) were harvested after enzymatically \n\ntreatment with trypsin/EDTA or Accutase\nTM\n\n and suspended in culture medium, cell counts were \n\nevaluated using a standard Trypan Blue exclusion assay and seeded at 3\u00d710\n3\n\n cell?cm\n-2\n\n on the diverse \n\nsurfaces utilized and then incubated during 24 hours in standard conditions. Afterwards, the culture \n\nmedium was refreshed by serum-free medium containing a suspension of CHI/ELR microcapsules. \n\nAfter 3 h of CHI/ELR microcapsules co-incubation, the cultures were maintained for longer times, by \n\nsupplementing the microcapsule suspension with additional fresh medium to reach the final serum \n\nconcentration of 2% FBS. \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 Cellular uptake of multilayered capsules produced with biomimetic and genetically \n\nengineered macromolecules \n\n \n\n344 \n\n10.2.7 Cell viability assays \n\nMetabolic activity was evaluated by Alamar Blue\n\u00ae\n and cell viability by LIVE/DEAD\u00ae assays. The relative \n\nnumber of hMSCs metabolically active within each experimental condition was evaluated by the Alamar \n\nBlue\n\u00ae\n assay according to the manufacturer guidelines. Briefly, 24 hours after cells seeding, cells culture \n\nwas washed and then (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 and (CHI/ELR-RDG\n(-)\n\n)2 microcapsules in serum-free culture \n\nmedium were added in incremental ratios of 5 to 100 microcapsules per cell. After 3 and 72 h of \n\nmicrocapsules co-incubation, the fluorimetric reduction of 10% Alamar Blue\n\u00ae\n reagent in culture medium \n\nwas measured with a microtiter plate reader (SpectraMax M2e Molecular Devices). Non-treated cells \n\nwere employed as positive control and their fluorescence was considered as the 100% of cells viability. \n\nThe viability of cells co-incubated with CHI/ELR was also examined by a LIVE/DEAD\n\u00ae\n assays. Ten \n\nmicrocapsules per cell of each CHI/ELR microcapsule type were added to the cell culture. The ratio of \n\nmicrocapsules per cell was selected after obtaining the results of the cell viability assays. In this assay, \n\nthe co-incubation with calcein AM and ethidium homodimer-1 allows distinguishing the cytoplasm of live \n\ncells (with esterase cleavage of calcein accompanied by green fluorescence), and dead cells (which \n\ncompromised membranes enable to stain nucleic acids with red fluorescence). LIVE/DEAD\n\u00ae\n assays was \n\ncarried out at different time points (0, 72 and 240 h) according to the manufacturing specifications. \n\n10.2.8 Statistical analysis \n\nValues reported reflect means\u00b1standard error (SE) of four samples of four independent cell culture \n\nviability experiments at 3 or 72 hours of incubation. The influence of microcapsules/cell ratio on cell \n\nviability was analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the post test of Bonferroni. All \n\ntreatment-related effects were considered to be statistically significant at p-value less than 0.05.

After 3 or 72 h of incubation, samples \n\nwere washed with DPBS three times. \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 Cellular uptake of multilayered capsules produced with biomimetic and genetically \n\nengineered macromolecules \n\n \n\n345 \n\nSamples for microscopy analysis \u2013 confocal, phase-contrast, epifluorescence, and differential \n\ninterference contrast (DIC) microscopy (Nomarski) \u2013 were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, \n\npermeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and stained with DAPI. A confocal microscope (Leica \n\nMicrosystems, Heidelberg GmbH, microscope confocal Leica SP5) was used for analyzing \n\nmicrocapsules inside the cells.

The images of each \n\nfluorophore and phase contrast were overlaid to obtain a multilayer image using ImageJ software \n\n(National Institutes of Health). Bright field and fluorescence microscopy were performed in a NIKON \n\nEclipse Ti fluorescence microscope, equipped with a digital camera system (Digital sight DS-2MBWc), \n\nusing blue, green and red filters. \n\n10.2.10 Cell analysis by flow cytometry \n\n1.5\u00d710\n5\n hMSCs were seeded in a 25 cm\n\n2\n flasks and cultured as described above.  (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 \n\nand (CHI/ELR-RDG\n(-)\n\n)2 microcapsules were added at a microcapsule-to-cell ratio of 10:1 and incubated \n\nduring 72 h. The cell cultures dissociated by Accutase\nTM\n\n treatment \u2013 specially developed for gentle and \n\neffective cell dissociation \u2013 were washed, counted, suspended in DPBS, 25 mM HEPES 5% FBS and \n\nanalyzed in a flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). The assay was repeated three times. All treatment-\n\nrelated effects were considered to be statistically significant at p-value less than 0.05. All data was \n\nanalyzed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA).  \n\n10.3 Results and discussion \n\nFirst, CaCO3 microparticles were coated with two bilayers of chitosan and the ELRs containing either \n\nthe motif RGD or RDG. Hollow capsules were produced by their subsequent incubation with EDTA and \n\nchelation of the sacrificial core \u2013 henceforth referred to as (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 or (CHI/ELR-RDG\n(-)\n\n)2, \n\nrespectively. The morphology of the microcapsules was evaluated by CLSM and SEM, and the capsules\u2019 \n\nwall by TEM (Figure 10.1). TEM (Figure 10.1A), which was used solely to observe the wall delimiting the \n\ninterior and exterior of the microcapsules, showed a multilayer shell that could be distinguished at the \n\nborders of the structure. For the morphological analysis, the samples for microscopy observation were \n\nprepared at 37\u00baC. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 Cellular uptake of multilayered capsules produced with biomimetic and genetically \n\nengineered macromolecules \n\n \n\n346 \n\n \n\nFigure 10.1.

Costa et al. [36] demonstrated that this class \n\nof microcapsules have a diameter of 5.5 ?m at room temperature but shrink when incubated at 37\u00baC, \n\nto around 3 ?m. Therefore, this temperature was chosen to prepare the samples and assess their \n\nmorphology under a temperature similar to that of a biological environment. \n\nThe preparation of individual polymeric capsules while avoiding aggregation is difficult but necessary for \n\napplications that require cellular uptake and survival. Figure 10.1B shows several CHI/ELR \n\nmicrocapsules observed under CLSM. All microcapsules showed diameters of 3\u20134 ?m and had their \n\nown individual walls (which served as polymeric reservoirs for the rhodamine dye) and hollow interior \n\n(hence not dyed after the 10 minutes treatment). The graphic in Figure 10.1C, where the fluorescence \n\nintensity is plotted as a function of the length of the lines drawn, confirms that the interior was empty \n\nand thus the dissolution of the CaCO3 core was successful. In Figure 10.1D, the morphological analysis \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 Cellular uptake of multilayered capsules produced with biomimetic and genetically \n\nengineered macromolecules \n\n \n\n347 \n\nof (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 microcapsules shows that the integrity of the wall was maintained through the \n\nprocess of its construction to the moment of their use. This observation indicates that the used \n\noperational conditions permitted to obtain individual spherical microstructures. No signs of aggregation \n\nwere found, what makes the produced microcapsules suitable for the subsequent cellular studies. In \n\nFigure 10.1E, microcapsules made of CHI and the ELR-RDG\n(-)\n\n can be observed. Unlike RGD, RDG is a \n\nnonbioactive motif similar to RGD in all aspects, except for the position of the G and D amino acids. As \n\nsuch, the scrambled RDG sequence was previously shown to have significantly less cellular adhesion in \n\nrespect to its functional RGD counterpart [37,38]. These microcapsules resembled in morphology and \n\nsize the (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 microcapsules (Figure 10.1D). With such similarity, it was expectable that \n\ndifferences in the mechanism and efficacy of internalization of these two microcapsule types \u2013 if any \u2013 \n\nwould be solely caused by their peptide sequence bioactivity rather than by a morphological \n\ndiscrepancy. \n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are hypoimmunogenic and pluripotent able to differentiate in in vitro, \n\nex vivo and in vivo, into multiple cells types such as osteocytes, adipocytes, chondrocytes, neurocytes, \n\nhepatocytes, myocytes, and hematopoietic-supporting stroma. These characteristics have been \n\nconsidered crucial factors when aiming to develop new candidates for clinical use, especially in tissue \n\nengineering and regenerative medicine applications, such as transplantation, local implantation, gene \n\ntherapy, and drug delivery [39,40]. Cellular therapies in particular can be envisaged in order to \n\ninternalize molecules with the aim to control cellular behavior, such as the induced differentiation of \n\nMSCs into osteoblasts [41]. Therefore, the option to use hMSCs in a model of internalization of \n\nCHI/ELR microcapsules could open the direct applicability of the methodology described herein. \n\nIn order to demonstrate if this kind of hybrid nanostructured microcapsules are suitable for biological \n\napplications, we analyzed the in vitro viability of hMSCs by means of their metabolic activity in the \n\npresence of (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 and (CHI/ELR-RDG\n(-)\n\n)2. We studied the dose-dependent response effect \n\nfor two experimental times: 3 h and 72 h. hMSCs were co-incubated with increasing microcapsule/cell \n\nratios within a range of 5 to 100 units per cell. In Figure 2, the cell viability is represented normalized in \n\nrespect to the positive control, that is, cells cultured without microcapsules. As observed in Figure \n\n10.2A and Figure 10.2B, after 3 h and 72 h of incubation with (CHI/ELR-RGD)2, the metabolic activity \n\ndid not vary significantly for the studied ratio range in respect to the positive control. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 Cellular uptake of multilayered capsules produced with biomimetic and genetically \n\nengineered macromolecules \n\n \n\n348 \n\n(A) (B)\n\n(C) (D)\n\n3 h 72 h\n(C\n\nH\nI/E\n\nL\nR\n\n-R\nD\n\nG\n(-))\n\n2\n(C\n\nH\nI/E\n\nL\nR\n\n-R\nG\n\nD\n)\n2\n\n5\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n5\n\n2\n0\n\n3\n0\n\n4\n0\n\n5\n0\n\n6\n0\n\n7\n0\n\n8\n0\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nm\ne\nta\n\nb\no\nli\nc\n a\n\nc\nti\nv\nit\ny\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nratio (microcapsules.cell\n-1\n)\n\n5\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n5\n\n2\n0\n\n3\n0\n\n4\n0\n\n5\n0\n\n6\n0\n\n7\n0\n\n8\n0\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nm\ne\nta\n\nb\no\nli\nc\n a\n\nc\nti\nv\nit\ny\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nratio (microcapsules.cell\n-1\n)\n\n5\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n5\n\n2\n0\n\n3\n0\n\n4\n0\n\n5\n0\n\n6\n0\n\n7\n0\n\n8\n0\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nm\ne\n\nta\nb\n\no\nli\nc\n a\n\nc\nti\nv\nit\ny\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nratio (microcapsules.cell\n-1\n)\n\n5\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n5\n\n2\n0\n\n3\n0\n\n4\n0\n\n5\n0\n\n6\n0\n\n7\n0\n\n8\n0\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nm\ne\nta\n\nb\no\nli\nc\n a\n\nc\nti\nv\nit\ny\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nratio (microcapsules.cell\n-1\n)\n\n \n\nFigure 10.2.

Data represent means of \n\nfour experiments, each performed in quadruplicate, normalized in respect to the positive control. Error \n\nbars represent one standard error (mean+SE). No significant statistical differences were found (p-value \n\nhigher than 0.05). \n\n \n\nIn light of our results, (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 hybrid microcapsules are not only noncytotoxic for hMSCs but \n\ncan also help maintaining a high cellular metabolic activity over a high ratio of microcapsules in respect \n\nto the number of cells. A similar trend was observed for ELR-RDG\n(-)\n\n-functionalized microcapsules. For \n\nboth time-points (Figure 10.2C and Figure 10.2D), there were no apparent metabolic activity differences \n\nin respect to the positive control as a function of microcapsule concentrations. \n\nAnalyzing the graphics for 72 h of incubation (Figure 10.2B and Figure 10.2D), one can observe that \n\nthere is a decrease in the mean metabolic activity of cells incubated with either microcapsule type for \n\nthe highest microcapsule/cell ratios. This decrease can be seen for a ratio higher than 50:1 for \n\n(CHI/ELR-RGD)2 and 60:1 for (CHI/ELR-RDG\n(-)\n\n)2 microcapsules. When considering cell viability, one \n\ncould expect that a large quantity of microcapsules will reduce nutrient and gas exchanges between the \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 Cellular uptake of multilayered capsules produced with biomimetic and genetically \n\nengineered macromolecules \n\n \n\n349 \n\ninternal cellular compartment and the culture medium, eventually leading to cell death [42]. Although \n\nthe microcapsules presented herein are noncytotoxic towards hMSCs even for the highest studied ratios, \n\nit is plausible to affirm that a large number of microcapsules will have negative impact in the metabolic \n\nactivity of the cells. \n\nDespite the high metabolic activity observed in comparison to the positive control, it was also apparent \n\nthat cells incubated with (CHI/ELR-RDG\n(-)\n\n)2 microcapsules were less viable than their biofunctional \n\nanalogues. For instance, after incubating 10 microcapsules per cell during 72 h with hMSCs, a viability \n\nof 139% (ELR-RGD-based elements) was estimated in comparison to 105% (ELR-RDG\n(-)\n\n-based elements), \n\naccounting for a reduction of 24%. \n\nIn Figure 10.3, the metabolic activity measurements for every microcapsule/cell ratio were coupled \n\ntogether and their mean was calculated to estimate the cellular viability for each microcapsule type. \n\n \n\n3 h 72 h\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nm\ne\nta\n\nb\no\nli\nc\n a\n\nc\nti\nv\nit\ny\n (\n\nm\ne\na\nn\n %\n\n o\nf \nP\n\nC\n)\n\n (CHI/ELR-RDG\n(-)\n\n)\n2\n\n (CHI/ELR-RGD)\n2\n\n \n\nFigure 10.3.

Error bars represent one standard error (mean+SE). No significant \n\nstatistical differences were found (p-value higher than 0.05). \n\n \n\nIn the case of the longest incubation time (72 h), hMSCs incubated with RGD-functionalized \n\nmicrocapsules exhibited a mean metabolic activity of 114%, while RDG\n(-)\n\n-functionalized ones exhibited \n\n102%. These differences in bioactivity do not account for a significant difference between each \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 Cellular uptake of multilayered capsules produced with biomimetic and genetically \n\nengineered macromolecules \n\n \n\n350 \n\nmicrocapsules type, although the mean bioactivity values of (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 are higher for all time-\n\npoints. This small disparity could be the result of RGD-induced integrin activation in the dorsal region of \n\nthe cells, a non-selective interaction, which is known to be involved in several metabolic pathways, such \n\nas those of proliferation and differentiation [43,44]. \n\nIn light of these results, it seems possible to apply rather large amounts of hybrid microcapsules to \n\nhMSCs without severely affecting their viability, even when using the non-functional RDG analogue. The \n\nlowest microcapsule/cell ratios also provided the most favorable conditions for hMSCs incubation with \n\nboth types of functionalized microcapsules. Given these results, we selected a concentration of \n\n10 microcapsules per cell for all subsequent experiments. This way, it would be possible to keep the \n\nmicrocapsule/cell ratio to a minimum while avoiding a massive and systematic microcapsule \n\nadministration and ensuring a high cellular metabolic activity in respect to the positive control. \n\nCell viability assays by LIVE/DEAD\n\u00ae\n were carried out to complement the metabolic activity data for a \n\ntime-frame of 10 days and can be observed in Figure 10.4.  \n\n \n\n(C\nH\n\nI/\nR\n\nG\nD\n\n) 2\n(C\n\nH\nI/\n\nR\nD\n\nG\n(-\n\n) )\n2\n\n0 h 72 h +7 days\n\nA)\n\nE) F)\n\nB)\n\nD)\n\nC)\n\nmicrocapsule\n\nincubation\n\nmedium\n\nrenewal\n\n100 ?m\n\n100 ?m\n \n\nFigure 10.4.

(C, F). \n\n \n\nIn respect to the (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 microcapsules effect, after an incubation period of 72 h, the green \n\ncalcein staining confirmed that the cells were alive and well-spread on the surface (Figure 10.4B). The \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 Cellular uptake of multilayered capsules produced with biomimetic and genetically \n\nengineered macromolecules \n\n \n\n351 \n\nsame trend is observed for the (CHI/ELR-RDG\n(-)\n\n)2 (Figure 10.4E), with no visible differences between \n\neach case. In order to assess if the cells could remain alive after being cultured in the presence of \n\nhybrid microcapsules, complete DMEM was added after 72 h to the co-incubation medium. Then this \n\nmixture was maintained for another 168 h to a total of 10 days of culture before LIVE/DEAD\n\u00ae\n assays \n\nwere performed. As observed in Figure 10.4C and Figure 10.4F, no dead cells were encountered, \n\nclearly indicating that hMSCs viability was not affected by the incubation with the foreign microcapsule \n\ncomponents \u2013 as supported by the metabolic activity assays \u2013 even after a longer exposition time. \n\nIn order to determine if this class of hybrid microcapsules could be internalized by cells, hMSCs were \n\nco-incubated first with (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 for 72 h. To aid in this microscopy visualization, the \n\nmicrocapsules were loaded with DQ-ovalbumin. This commercially available product is a conjugate of \n\novalbumin heavily labeled with BODIPY dyes. Due to a characteristic self-quenching mechanism, it \n\nexhibits a bright red fluorescence characterized by the close proximity of the fluorescent dyes, but it \n\nshifts to a strong green upon proteolysis. This means that it would be possible to follow the \n\ninternalization of the microcapsules and the intracellular processing of the cargo by fluorescence assays. \n\nConfocal microscopy (Figure 10.5) confirmed the presence of internalized RGD-functionalized \n\nmicrocapsules after 72 h of incubation. A yellow color (resulting from the simultaneous fluorescence \n\nemission of red and green) could be observed in different planes of the cells, evidencing that the \n\nmicrocapsules containing DQ-ovalbumin were processed by the hMSCs. In Figure 10.5A, the arrows \n\npoint to bright green dots, indicating the presence of fully degraded microcapsules. To reflect upon the \n\nelectrostatic interactions between capsules and cellular membrane, the charges of ELR-RGD and \n\nELR-RDG\n(-)\n\n in aqueous solution were determined by ?-potential measurements. They were shown to \n\nhave a charge of -5.7\u00b11.2 mV and -6.3\u00b11.2 mV, respectively, in PBS. One could argue that the negative \n\ncharge of the ELR outer layer could potentially hinder the internalization by conflicting with the \n\nelectrostatic nature of the cellular membrane [45]. However, electrostatic interactions alone were \n\npreviously unable to account for cellular adhesion to surfaces modified with polycations [46] and thus is \n\nexpected to have little influence in comparison to the bioactive properties of the used macromolecules. \n\nTherefore, these results show that cellular uptake of CHI/ELR microcapsules can be achieved and that \n\ntheir intracellular degradation can be followed by the used fluorophore. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 Cellular uptake of multilayered capsules produced with biomimetic and genetically \n\nengineered macromolecules \n\n \n\n352 \n\nD)\n\n40 ?m\n\nB)\n\n40 ?m\n\nC)\n\n40 ?m\n\nA)\n\n40 ?m\n\nC, D\nB\nA\n\n3 ?m\n\n \n\nFigure 10.5.

Viable cells include cells that were \n\neither empty (with low side-scattering intensity, Iss) or internalized microcapsules (with high Iss).

It should be noted that a cell can bear DQ-\n\novalbumin-loaded microcapsules in every of these processing stages, that is, DQ-ovalbumin exhibiting \n\nred, green, or both. Thus, events with high intensity in either of these spectra corresponded to cells \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 Cellular uptake of multilayered capsules produced with biomimetic and genetically \n\nengineered macromolecules \n\n \n\n354 \n\ncontaining DQ-ovalbumin in distinct stages of intracellular processing: intact, degraded, or in process of \n\ndegradation. Within the delimited area in Figure 10.6B are found empty cells, verified from a control of \n\ncells cultured without microcapsules. The data indicate that 63\u00b117% of the hMSCs have internalized \n\n(CHI/ELR-RGD)2 microcapsules, as depicted in Figure 10.6E. \n\nThis same analysis was performed for (CHI/ELR-RDG\n(-)\n\n)2 (see Figure 10.6C and Figure 10.6D), after \n\nwhich an internalization efficiency of 53\u00b110% was determined. No statistical differences were found \n\nbetween both cases, indicating that the exhibition of RGD did not influence the incorporation of the \n\nmicrocapsules by the hMSCs, in respect to microcapsules exhibiting RDG. Nonetheless, the mean \n\ninternalization efficacy for (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 was higher than its nonbioactive counterpart, which may \n\nindicate a minor contribution of receptor-mediated interactions in the cellular uptake. \n\nOur results indicate that the internalization of LbL microcapsules is not affected significantly when \n\ncoupled with biofunctional components, contrary to what was demonstrated by other authors.[48,49] \n\nFor instance, Caruso and coworkers [48] showed that poly(styrene sulfonate)/poly(allylamine \n\nhydrochloride) (PSS/PAH) capsules (around 500 nm in diameter) functionalized with humanized A33 \n\nmonoclonal antibodies could be internalized specifically by LIM1215 colorectal cancer cells. However, \n\nin another work, De Koker et al. [50] inhibited different endocytic pathways and actin polymerization in \n\nbone-marrow-derived dendritic cells. Their results demonstrated that microcapsules with around 3 ?m \n\nare internalized via macropinocytosis \u2013 a nonspecific endocytosis mechanism for foreign materials \n\nroughly between 500\u20132000 nm [51]. Therefore it is likely that macropinocytosis was the major \n\nendocytosis mechanism involved in the cellular uptake of carrier devices of this class and size (around \n\n3\u20134 ?m in diameter), to which surface functionalization does not play a determinant role. \n\nUpon internalization of a drug carrier, it is important to ensure that the agent is not only delivered but \n\nalso available for use by cells. Thanks to the use of DQ-ovalbumin, the consumption of this cargo by \n\ncells could be conveniently assessed by fluorescence changes. After quantifying the cellular uptake, the \n\nbioavailability of DQ-ovalbumin was evaluated by co-incubating cultured hMSCs with each kind of \n\nmicrocapsules in parallel for 3 and 72 h.

A shift from red/orange to green/yellow indicates a transition \n\nbetween fully intact to degraded cargo. Images are of fluorescence and differential interference contrast \n\n(DIC) microscopy at 40\u00d7 magnification.  \n\n \n\nThis observation was common for both (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 and (CHI/ELR-RDG\n(-)\n\n)2 microcapsules (Figure \n\n10.7B and Figure 10.7D). A closer observation permits to detect some green dots after 3 h of \n\nincubation, like in the case of (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 microcapsules (Figure 10.7B). Such observation is \n\nconsistent with the work of Rivera-Gil et al. [17], in which the same fluorescent protein was used. In \n\ntheir work with nonbiodegradable poly(styrene sulfonate)/poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PSS/PAH) \n\nmicrocapsules, they concluded that a green fluorescence exhibited in capsules that are not expected to \n\ndegrade \u2013 hence efficiently protecting their cargo \u2013 would still be permeable and prone to this \n\nfluorescence change. Variables such as the pH and ionic strength influence the permeability of the \n\npolyelectrolyte capsules, thus DQ-ovalbumin would still be able to diffuse through the multilayer shell \n\nand exposed to proteases and be degraded. \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 Cellular uptake of multilayered capsules produced with biomimetic and genetically \n\nengineered macromolecules \n\n \n\n356 \n\nAfter 72 h of incubation, a higher amount of microcapsules were detected interacting with the cells, in \n\ncomparison to the shorter time-point, with a predominant presence of yellow capsules found in the case \n\nof hMSCs incubated with RGD-functionalized microcapsules and red capsules in the case of cells \n\nincubated with the non-functional analogue ones. This observation indicates that, even after 72 h of \n\nincubation, distinct stages of microcapsule/cell internalization and intracellular processing could be \n\nfound. However, judging by the intense yellow and occasional green dots in Figure 10.7C, the \n\nbioavailability of DQ-ovalbumin encapsulated within (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 microcapsules seemed higher. \n\nThe microscopy comparison between both types of microcapsules (Figure 10.7) seems to indicate that \n\nboth (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 and (CHI/ELR-RDG\n(-)\n\n)2 situations bear little difference in respect to the number of \n\napparent internalized carriers. Nonetheless, a dominant emission fluorescence towards the green \n\nspectrum \u2013 that of cleaved DQ-ovalbumin \u2013 was dominant in the former. This result shows that the \n\ncargo of RGD-functionalized microcapsules was processed faster, evidencing a higher bioavailability of \n\nDQ-ovalbumin for this carrier type. In this sense, the bioavailability rate of the cargo does not follow the \n\nresults from the cellular uptake quantification shown in Figure 10.6: the internalization efficacy does not \n\nseem much influenced by the surface functionalization, whereas the intracellular processing of their \n\ncargo does. The study of the internalization mechanism and intracellular processing has not been much \n\nresearched. It is true that the role of macropinocytosis was previously demonstrated [50] but it is known \n\nthat functionalizing an interface can mediate specific integrin interactions [52]. Given that the surface \n\nfunctionalization in this work had little influence in the internalization efficacy, one would expect that the \n\ndegradation of their cargo would be similar after the studied time of exposure. It could be suggested \n\nthat the distinct functionality of the adsorbed recombinamers triggers distinct proteolytic pathways, just \n\nas RGD may active proliferation- and differentiation-related integrins. However, the study of such \n\nmechanism was out of the scope of this work. Such mechanism should be studied in the future in order \n\nto properly determine carrier and cargo fates upon cellular uptake, especially for carriers of the same \n\nclass internalized by similar endocytic mechanisms. With these results, we conclude that CHI/ELR \n\nmicrocapsules can be internalized by hMSCs, regardless of their surface functionalization, and may act \n\nas suitable carriers for the intracellular delivery of active agents. \n\n10.4 Conclusion \n\nWe presented the fabrication of multilayer microcapsules made of natural and nature-inspired polymers \n\nfor intracellular delivery of active agents. Thanks to the nature of the constituents, the microcapsules \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 Cellular uptake of multilayered capsules produced with biomimetic and genetically \n\nengineered macromolecules \n\n \n\n357 \n\nwere noncytotoxic as their degradation does not result in harmful products for the cells. Cellular uptake \n\nwas demonstrated, showing their potential as carriers for drug delivery directly to the cellular machinery. \n\nIn the future, this way of delivery may help minimizing drug losses and increasing their delivery control \n\nand efficacy. The internalization efficacy demonstrated for hMSCs lets foresee their use in cell/tissue \n\nengineering and regenerative medicine where it is important to control the differentiation of stem cells \n\ninto specific phenotypes. This work confirmed that CHI/ELR microcapsules could interact and be \n\ninternalized by cells, but experiments with microcapsules loaded with actual active agents are envisaged, \n\nsuch as molecules that trigger the differentiation of cells into specific phenotypes. The mechanism of \n\ninternalization of the microcapsules at this scale did not depend on the surface functionalization. They \n\nwere internalized via macropinocytosis although the ELR functionalization suggested a minor role of \n\nintegrin-mediated mechanisms. In this context, the recombinant nature of ELRs will be of interest to \n\nfurther study the microcapsules\u2019 endocytosis mechanism. In particular, it is possible that the production \n\nof smaller capsules by using nanotemplates may increase the influence of RGD and facilitate \n\ninternalization [53]. The inclusion of bioactive motifs other than this generic motif may constitute a \n\nstrong advantage of using such recombinant technologies, allowing exploring not only specific \n\nrecognition processes but also degradation pathways for targeted delivery and increased drug efficacy. \n\nTherefore, multilayer microcapsules using biomimetic ingredients for intracellular delivery let foresee \n\nnew strategies to increase the availability of molecules of interest in cells and for targeted biomedical \n\napplications. \n\n10.5 Acknowledgements \n\nWe acknowledge financial support from Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia  (grant \n\nSFRH/BD/61126/2009), \"Fundo Social Europeu\", \"Programa Diferencial de Potencial Humano\", EU \n\n7th Framework Programme (n\u00ba REGPOT-CT2012-316331-POLARIS), the EU through the European \n\nregional development fund (ERDF), from the MINECO (MAT-2010-15982, MAT2010-15310, PRI-PIBAR-\n\n2011-1403 and MAT2012-38043), the JCyL (projects VA049A11, VA152A12 and VA155A12), the \n\nCIBER-BBN, and the JCyL and the Instituto de Salud Carlos III under the \u201cNetwork Center of \n\nRegenerative Medicine and Cellular Therapy of Castilla and Leon\u201d. \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \u2013 Cellular uptake of multilayered capsules produced with biomimetic and genetically \n\nengineered macromolecules \n\n \n\n358 \n\n10.6 References \n\n[1] Malam Y., Loizidou M., and Seifalian A.

Such a multifunctional device that is \n\ncapable of addressing several reactions at once would, however, be difficult to develop. Perhaps not \n\nsurprisingly, nature gives us an elegant example of a multifunctional entity in the form of biological cells. \n\nDue to their unique hierarchical and compartmentalized organization, they allow numerous compounds \n\nto be transported, proteins to be synthesized and enzymatic reactions to be regulated within their \n\ncytoplasm. However, building artificial cells is still a technology in its infancy. In an attempt to mimic \n\ncells, a great deal of research has focused on hierarchical nano- and microcompartments [4-6]. Multi-\n\nshelled organic and inorganic capsules prepared by template-assisted strategies are usually \n\naccompanied by harsh processing conditions [7-9]. In contrast, compartmentalized assemblies of \n\npolymeric multilayer nano/microcapsules within larger partitions have been achieved by using non-\n\naggressive bottom-up strategies [10-14]. In any case, compartmentalization has allowed combining \n\nproperties and confine reactions that could not be achieved otherwise with single-component \n\nassemblies [4]. \n\nThe most attractive characteristic of compartmentalized devices does not necessarily involve their \n\npotential ability to mimic intracellular reactions, such as confining drugs and enzymatic reactions into \n\npartitions [15-17]. Compartmental systems should ideally be customizable by assembling \n\nsubcompartments which exhibit functions that are not coupled naturally. Moreover, following a proper \n\nselection of the constituents, the range of such functions could be widened by exploiting the properties \n\nof stimuli-responsive materials [18]. Some examples that would benefit from such approach are the \n\nrelease control of several biomolecules delivered simultaneously for enhanced drug delivery [19], the \n\nimmobilization of such a device spatially for targeted therapies [20], and the control over a multitude of \n\ncellular events that lead to stem cell differentiation [21]. \n\nIn our goal to construct a hierarchical multifunctional device, we aimed to demonstrate that both \n\nmolecular compounds and inorganic iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles can be encapsulated in distinct \n\ncompartments. We report the construction of liquefied microcapsule-containing gel beads manufactured \n\nusing a hybrid \u201cionic gelation\u201d strategy of alginate assisted by a layer-by-layer (LbL) approach. LbL is a \n\n\n\nChapter 11. Multifunctional compartmentalized capsules with a hierarchical organization from the nano- \n\nto the macro-scales \n\n \n\n366 \n\nsimple and versatile technique which allows producing robust coatings, even in substrates with complex \n\ngeometries. Because it discards the need of organic and harmful solvents, it is an attractive technique \n\nfor tissue engineering applications [22-24]. In three-dimensional structures, namely spherical capsules, \n\nthe semi-permeable nature of multilayer coatings can be used to tune the permeability of molecules of \n\ninterest in or out, or to completely confine them [13,25-27]. Herein, liquefied alginate macrocapsules \n\ndelimited by multilayer shells of chitosan/alginate (CHI/ALG) were intended to containing \n\nmicrocapsules made of CHI/\u201delastin-like recombinamer (ELR)\u201d inside. The latter, on their side, \n\ncontained either magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) or model molecular compounds, such as the model \n\nlow molecular weight fluorophores fluorescein isothiocyanate and rhodamine. \n\nCHI and ALG are two well-known polysaccharides of marine origin which show biocompatibility, \n\nadhesiveness, non-toxicity, as well as bacteriostatic, fungistatic, anti-microbial and hemostatic \n\nactivities [28,29]. ELRs, a recombinant type of elastin-like polymer (ELP), are temperature-responsive \n\npolypeptides that are soluble in aqueous media below a specific critical transition temperature (Tt) but \n\nundergo a phase separation above it [30-32]. Lastly, MNPs are structures susceptible to magnetic fields. \n\nThey are often used to enhance medical imaging diagnosis of soft tissues (e.g., magnetic resonance \n\nimaging, MRI) and temperature-triggered treatments such as hyperthermia and tissue ablation [33-35]. \n\nIn light of the potential applications of compartmentalized structures, we have studied the properties of \n\neach of the structures that can be found at the nano-, micro- and macro-scales, the permeability of the \n\nmultilayer shells at distinct temperatures (namely the coatings containing the temperature-responsive \n\nELR) and the response to external magnetic fields. We hypothesized that such systems could be \n\nfabricated and customized to display smart tunable permeability and spatial \n\nmobilization/immobilization. \n\n11.2 Experimental section \n\n11.2.1 Materials \n\nMedium molecular weight chitosan was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (ref 448877) and purified by a \n\nseries of filtration and precipitation in water and ethanol steps, adapted from the method described by \n\nSignini and Filho [36], followed by freeze-drying. The degree of deacetylation was determined to be 82% \n\n(Supplemental Figure 11.1). Alginic acid sodium salt from brown algae was purchased from Sigma-\n\nAldrich (ref 71238) and used as received. \n\n\n\nChapter 11 \u2013 Multifunctional compartmentalized capsules with a hierarchical organization from the \n\nnano- to the macro-scales \n\n \n\n367 \n\n11.2.2 Bioproduction of the elastin-like recombinamers \n\nAn ELR containing a L-arginine-glycine-L-aspartic acid (RGD) motif was bioproduced using a \n\nfermentation process from an Escherichia coli strain BLR(DE3) containing an appropriate expression \n\ngene, obtained using an appropriate protocol for gene design [37]. After fermentation, the culture was \n\nharvested and lysed by ultrasonic disruption. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation and the \n\ncleared lysate was subjected to several cycles of cold (4\u00baC) and warm (40\u00baC) centrifugations, at \n\n10000 rpm for 10 minutes each. Finally, the polymer was dialyzed against ultra-pure Milli-Q water at \n\n4\u00b0C in dialysis membranes with a 12 kDa molecular weight cut-off for a minimum of 6 hours, after \n\nwhich the water was changed. After 4 changes of water, the biopolymer was frozen and freeze-dried. \n\nCharacterization of the bioproduct was done previously [22,38]. \n\n11.2.3 Synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles \n\nIn a typical synthesis to synthesize spherical iron oxide MNPs, 10 mL of a solution containing 1.2 g of \n\niron(III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3?6H2O, Sigma-Aldrich ref. 236489) and 0.6 g of iron(II) chloride \n\ntetrahydrate (FeCl2?4H2O, Sigma-Aldrich ref 220299) was added drop-wise to 25 mL of ammonium \n\nhydroxide solution (NH4OH, made of 33% ammonia, NH3, in H2O) over 4 h under an inert nitrogen \n\natmosphere. The products of the reaction were collected by magnetic separation and washed three \n\ntimes with ethanol and water. The last washing step was made with ethanol, after which the products \n\nwere left to dry at room temperature. \n\n11.2.4 Characterization of the MNPs \n\nThe shape and morphology of the magnetite nanoparticles were determined using high resolution \n\ntransmission electronic microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-1011, operating at 200 kV). Samples were \n\nprepared by dropping a dilute aqueous solution (concentration = 1 mg?mL\n-1\n\n) of the nanoparticles onto a \n\n200-mesh copper grid and allowing the solvent to evaporate. The magnetization of the MNPs was \n\nmeasured as a function of the applied external magnetic field (maximum value 10 kOe) using a \n\nvibrating sample magnetometer (PPMS, Quantum Design) at 300 K. \n\n\n\nChapter 11. Multifunctional compartmentalized capsules with a hierarchical organization from the nano- \n\nto the macro-scales \n\n \n\n368 \n\n11.2.5 Temperature-induced aggregate measurements \n\nThe aggregate sizes of chitosan, alginate and ELR in solution were measured using the dynamic light \n\nscattering (DLS) from a Nano-ZS from Malvern (United Kingdom) for temperatures 25\u00baC/37\u00b0C after \n\nstabilization for 5 min. The samples of alginate and ELR were prepared at 300 \u00b5g?mL\n-1\n\n in \n\nphosphate-buffered solution (PBS), pH 7.4. In the case of chitosan, the solvent was acetic acid at \n\n1% (w/v) and sodium chloride (NaCl) concentration of 0.15 M, pH 5.5. Measurements were performed \n\nfirst at 25\u00baC, then 37\u00baC and finally back at 25\u00baC. A total of 20 runs were performed for each sample to \n\nobtain an average value at stabilized temperature. \n\n11.2.6 Synthesis of the calcium carbonate sacrificial particles, either empty or \n\nentrapping fluorophores/MNPs \n\nAqueous solutions of anhydrous sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, Sigma-Aldrich ref 222321) and calcium \n\nchloride (CaCl2, VWR ref 1.02378.0500) were prepared at 1 M. In a typical co-precipitation reaction, \n\n100 ?g of a desired material was entrapped in a medium of 200 \u00b5L of H2O by adding 100 \u00b5L of \n\nNa2CO3 followed by 100 \u00b5L of CaCl2 with rapid stirring for 30 seconds. The H2O precipitation medium \n\ncontained the material to be entrapped at a concentration of 500 ?g?mL\n-1\n\n. Three distinct ingredients \n\nwere added to the H2O precipitation medium: fluorescein-5(6)-isothiocyanate (FITC, 389 Da, Sigma-\n\nAldrich ref F3651), rhodamine-B isothiocyanate (Rhod, 536 Da, Sigma-Aldrich ref R1755) and MNPs. \n\nAs a control, empty microcapsules were also fabricated by using solely ultrapure H2O. Stirring was \n\nstopped after 30 s and the suspension of newly synthesized calcium carbonate (CaCO3) microparticles \n\nleft to react and precipitate for 15 min. The supernatant was then removed and the particles washed \n\ntwice with ultrapure water to remove residual salts and non-entrapped materials. Unless stated \n\notherwise, all supernatants were retained for fluorescence measurements and quantification of losses \n\nuntil the construction of compartmental capsules was completed. \n\n11.2.7 Construction of the microparticle multilayer coating \n\nThe CaCO3 sacrificial templates (empty or entrapping either a fluorophore or MNP) were immersed \n\nalternately in CHI and ELR solutions (300 \u00b5g?mL\n-1\n\n, pH 5.5, 0.15 M of NaCl) for 10 min each, then \n\nwashed with 0.15 M NaCl (pH 5.5 at 0.15 M). Centrifugation was avoided to prevent damage and \n\naggregation of the particles each time the samples were to be retrieved from solution; simple \n\n\n\nChapter 11 \u2013 Multifunctional compartmentalized capsules with a hierarchical organization from the \n\nnano- to the macro-scales \n\n \n\n369 \n\nprecipitation of the suspension was used instead (3 to 5 min). This process was repeated until three \n\nbilayers had been assembled, (CHI/ELR)3. For the sole purpose of confocal microscopy \n\ncharacterization described below, the CaCO3 cores were chelated at this point by immersion in \n\nethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA, Sigma-Aldrich ref E9884; 0.2 M, pH 5.5) for 30 min. \n\n11.2.8 Construction of multilayer coated external subcompartment-containing \n\nbeads \n\nA 1% (w/v) solution of alginic acid sodium salt was prepared. In a typical experiment, the \n\n(CHI/ELR)3-coated microparticles were suspended in 1 mL of alginate solution and the resulting \n\nsuspension extruded through a 25G needle, at a rate of 0.33 mL?min\n-1\n\n, into a 0.75% (w/v) solution of \n\nCaCl2 under mild stirring. Alginate beads containing coated microparticles were formed by calcium-\n\nmediated ionic gelation. The beads were immersed alternately in CHI and ALG solutions (300 \u00b5g?mL\n-1\n\n, \n\npH 5.5, 0.15 M NaCl) for 10 minutes each, then washed with 0.15 M NaCl (pH 5.5 at 0.15 M). This \n\nprocess was repeated until three bilayers had been assembled, (CHI/ALG)3. After the coating had been \n\nassembled, the beads were immersed in EDTA. At this point, the CaCO3 sacrificial templates are \n\nchelated simultaneously with the liquefied alginate bead. \n\nLiquefied alginate beads coated with (CHI/ALG)3 multilayers loaded with not only empty microcapsules \n\nand Rhod in the ALG medium were also constructed. Rhod was suspended alongside the empty \n\nmicrocapsules and encapsulated in the ALG bead compartment instead of in the inner microcapsules. \n\nIn a typical experiment, Rhod was suspended in ALG at 15 ?g?mL\n-1\n\n. This value was determined by first \n\ncalculating the construction losses resulting from the Rhod-loaded microcapsules within the external \n\nalginate macrocapsule in order to minimize concentration-dependent artifacts (see Supplemental Figure \n\n11.3 for details). \n\n11.2.9 Characterization of the compartmental units \n\nThe morphology of the FITC-loaded (CHI/ELR)3 microcapsules was determined using an Olympus \n\nFV1000 confocal microscope (Germany). TEM images of both empty and MNP-loaded microcapsules \n\nwere obtained using a JEOL JEM-1011 HR instrument operating at 80 kV. Prior to the observation, a \n\nvolume of 60 ?L of microcapsule suspension was pipetted onto a transmission electron microscopy \n\n(TEM) grid and left to evaporate overnight. An Axioimager Z1M Zeiss microscope (Germany) was used to \n\n\n\nChapter 11. Multifunctional compartmentalized capsules with a hierarchical organization from the nano- \n\nto the macro-scales \n\n \n\n370 \n\nobserve (CHI/ALG)3-coated liquefied beads using transmitted light and fluorescence microscopy for \n\nRhod-loaded external compartments. The latter also containing FITC-loaded microcapsules were \n\nobserved to assess the distribution of the subcompartments within the macrocapsules. \n\n11.2.10 Mechanical resistance of the external compartments \n\nA centrifugal rotation test was performed with the samples suspended in PBS to measure the \n\nmechanical resistance of the (CHI/ALG)3 macrocapsules. 100 samples were placed in centrifuge tubes \n\nand rotated at a starting centrifugal load of 500g. After 5 min, the number of intact beads was counted. \n\nThose that remained intact were submitted to incremental centrifugal loads (500g incremental steps) \n\nup to a maximum of 5000g. This experiment was performed three times.  \n\n11.2.11 Rhodamine release studies \n\nThe compartmentalized systems were suspended in PBS at either 25 or 37\u00baC. Prior to this study, Rhod \n\nwas encapsulated in one of two hierarchical locations: the internal (CHI/ELR)3 microcapsules (with \n\nRhod added during the co-precipitation stage) or the external liquefied alginate (CHI/ALG)3-coated \n\nmacrocapsules (with Rhod added to the initial alginate solution). The study was conducted for 2 h to \n\nassess the early release profile in 3 mL of PBS, with 600 ?L of surrounding PBS being removed every \n\n10 min and the container being refilled with the same volume of PBS pre-stabilized at the \n\ncorresponding temperature. 100% of Rhod was considered to be the total mass remaining in the \n\ncompartmental systems after taking construction losses into account. The studies were performed three \n\ntimes (n=3). \n\n11.2.12 Magnetic-based responsiveness \n\nMacrocapsules containing MNP-loaded microcapsules were suspended in a PBS-filled square \n\npolystyrene Petri dish placed upon a 1\u00d71 cm\n2\n grid. A 1.3 T permanent neodymium (NdFeB) bar \n\nmagnet (diameter: 4 mm; length: 2.5 cm) was used to apply the external magnetic field. Ten samples \n\nwere placed 3 cm away from the magnet, with the latter placed at a height of 1.4 cm from the PBS \n\nsurface. The movement was recorded on video and the mean normalized distance traversed by the \n\nsamples plotted as a function of time. \n\n\n\nChapter 11 \u2013 Multifunctional compartmentalized capsules with a hierarchical organization from the \n\nnano- to the macro-scales \n\n \n\n371 \n\n11.3 Results and discussion \n\nThe conception of a multifunctional compartmentalized device may involve using several ingredients \n\nfrom distinct classes of materials, depending on the functionalities desired from a system of this kind, \n\nand require a huge number of fabrication operations. An illustration of the proposed system is \n\nillustrated in Figure 11.1. \n\n \n\nFigure 11.1. Hierarchical organization of the multicompartmental capsules. Liquefied alginate beads, \n\ndelimited by a (CHI/ALG)3 coating, are visible to the naked eye. Multilayer microcapsules of (CHI/ELR)3 \n\nand molecular compounds can be suspended within the aqueous polymer phase. The former can \n\nfurther contain other types of molecular compounds and MNPs. \n\n \n\nThe borders between compartments consist of multilayer shells with three bilayers for the purpose of \n\nproof of concept. Our proposition comprises the fabrication of alginate beads by calcium-promoted ionic \n\ngelation separated from the environment by a multilayer coating of three CHI and ALG layers, \n\n(CHI/ALG)3, with thickness around 40 nm [39]. Prior to ionic gelation, the microscopic \n\nsubcompartments are suspended in an ALG solution to form beads containing small spherical \n\nstructures. These microcapsules are templated in CaCO3 microspheres and delimited by a coating of \n\nthree CHI and ELR layers, (CHI/ELR)3, with thickness around 25 nm [22]. In the subcompartments we \n\nencapsulated further components of smaller scales \u2013 fluorophores and MNPs. Since the synthesis of \n\nthe CaCO3 templates results from the co-precipitation of equimolar solutions of Na2CO3 and CaCl2, \n\nvarious substances can be added to the co-precipitation medium and entrapped within it. After the \n\n\n\nChapter 11. Multifunctional compartmentalized capsules with a hierarchical organization from the nano- \n\nto the macro-scales \n\n \n\n372 \n\nassembly of all compartments, the inorganic template is removed by treatment with EDTA, which also \n\nliquefies the alginate bead to a highly viscous medium. The final product is an external macrocapsule \n\ncontaining internal microcapsules \u2013 henceforth referred to as external (EC) and internal compartments \n\n(IC), respectively \u2013 with each partition being delimited by multilayer membranes. \n\nTo ensure that we could assemble structures from different size scales, the hierarchical organization of \n\nthe proposed system was characterized initially. MNPs, ICs and ECs were observed resorting to distinct \n\nmicroscopy techniques and are shown in Figure 11.2. Note that for every experiment performed, ECs \n\nare always loaded with empty ICs, i.e., without any fluorophore encapsulated, unless otherwise \n\nspecified. Using TEM, the MNPs (Figure 11.2a) were found to have a diameter of about 10 nm which, \n\nalong with the model molecular compounds, represents the smallest scale present in this system. FITC \n\nwas encapsulated within (CHI/ELR)3 microcapsules and could be observed by confocal laser scanning \n\nmicroscopy (CLSM) upon removal of the CaCO3 template (Figure 11.2b). We have previously \n\nconstructed multilayer films made of chitosan and ELRs. Characterization of this ELR \u2013 amino acid \n\nsequence, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF), and differential \n\nscanning calorimetry (DSC) \u2013 which contains a RGD motif, can be found elsewhere.[22,38] \n\nAlthough used previously to enhance cell adhesion, the primary reason for using this specific ELR \n\nherein was to enable LbL construction due to the negative charge provided by the aspartic acids (D), \n\nwith a pKa ranging from 3.0\u20134.7 [40], thus exploiting the biological function of this sequence was not in \n\nthe scope of this work. The average size of the ICs was 3 ?m, what places them at a microscale level. \n\nThe external compartments act as containers where both ICs and molecular compounds can be \n\nentrapped. Encapsulation of the fluorescent molecule Rhod showed that the (CHI/ALG)3 macrocapsules \n\nhave a diameter of 2 mm (Figure 11.2c) and are therefore representative of the visible scale. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 11 \u2013 Multifunctional compartmentalized capsules with a hierarchical organization from the \n\nnano- to the macro-scales \n\n \n\n373 \n\n \n\nFigure 11.2. Scales of hierarchical components. (a) TEM image of MNPs; (b) CLSM image of FITC-\n\ncontaining (CHI/ELR)3 microcapsules; (c) fluorescence microscopy image of the Rhod-containing \n\nliquefied ALG bead coated with (CHI/ALG)3. \n\n \n\nThe proposed formulation contains ingredients that respond to external stimuli. Namely, the polymeric \n\nconstituent ELR is known to respond to temperature, while MNPs to magnetic fields. These properties \n\nwere studied and the results are presented in Figure 11.3. The response to temperature of the \n\npolymers used herein \u2013 CHI, ALG and ELR \u2013 was assessed by means of aggregate size measurements \n\nat 25\u00baC and 37\u00baC. In Figure 11.3a, it is shown that the size of ELR aggregates at 25\u00baC is about \n\n200 nm. In contrast to this situation, at 37\u00baC aggregates of around 2000 nm were formed due to the \n\ntemperature transition of ELRs above their Tt (in Supplemental Figure 11.2, the Tt was determined to \n\nbe 29\u00baC).  \n\n\n\nChapter 11. Multifunctional compartmentalized capsules with a hierarchical organization from the nano- \n\nto the macro-scales \n\n \n\n374 \n\n \n\nFigure 11.3. Stimuli-responsiveness of the multicompartmental device constituents. (a) aggregate size \n\nmeasurements by DLS of CHI (pH 5.5), ALG and ELR (pH 7.4) at 300 \u00b5g?mL\n-1\n\n for a temperature cycle \n\nof 25\u201337\u201325\u00baC; (b) magnetization assay of MNPs. \n\n \n\nUpon decreasing the temperature to 25\u00baC once again, it was observed that the aggregate size \n\ndecreases to around 300 nm, confirming that the polypeptide used herein exhibits a reversible \n\nresponse towards temperature. Thus, the use of ELRs in such multilayer coatings may mean that the \n\npermeability of the subcompartments can be tuned simply by switching between room and \n\nphysiological temperatures. As expected, CHI and ALG were not significantly influenced, since they are \n\nnot temperature-responsive. For CHI, the working pH was of 5.5, as the pKa of this polysaccharide is \n\naround 6. Nonetheless, CHI is not a temperature responsive biomaterial, therefore pH is not expected \n\nto alter its response to this variable. The use of temperature responsive macromolecules could help in \n\ncontrolling the permeability of a carrier coating based on temperature variations, when the release of a \n\nspecific molecular compound needs to be more sustained or pronounced. At the same time, the use of \n\nCHI and ALG allows herein the assembly of a static coating, i.e. that is not stimuli-responsive under the \n\ntemperature-dependent experimental conditions used further on, used solely for the purpose of \n\nencapsulating the rest of the components in its interior. \n\nThe other constituent of this system are MNPs. Magnetization measurements with the MNPs are shown \n\nin Figure 11.3b. Magnetic particles can be classified as ferromagnetic and \n\nparamagnetic/superparamagnetic. Whereas the former exhibit a permanent magnetic dipole moment, \n\nwith a paramagnetic particle a magnetic dipole moment is induced only when an external magnetic field \n\nis applied [41-44]. The MNPs showed a saturation magnetization of 40 emu?g\n-1\n\n and the typical \n\nsigmoidal curve of superparamagnetic nanoparticles, thereby confirming their response to magnetic \n\nfields and potential use for spatial mobilization/immobilization of a host device. In particular, it is known \n\n\n\nChapter 11 \u2013 Multifunctional compartmentalized capsules with a hierarchical organization from the \n\nnano- to the macro-scales \n\n \n\n375 \n\nthat the success in therapeutic applications of growth factors often requires a release system for \n\ndelivery with spatiotemporal control [45]. Thus the magnetic component may help achieving a better \n\nefficacy of the encapsulated agent and reduce losses to surrounding fluids. \n\nAnother important characteristic of these systems is their mechanical resistance. The ECs are visible to \n\nthe naked eye and can therefore easily be handled. However, it is important to determine whether the \n\nexternal LbL coating can withstand handling whilst retaining the liquefied ALG. The integrity of the \n\n(CHI/ALG)3 coating was assessed by submitting the macrocapsules to incremental centrifugal stress. \n\nFigure 11.4 shows that these macrocapsules can withstand centrifugal stress, with 50% of them \n\nremaining intact at a rotation speed of 2000g. \n\n \n\n0 1 2 3 4 5\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nIn\nta\n\nc\nt \n\nc\na\n\np\ns\nu\n\nle\ns\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nRotation (g.10\n3\n)  \n\nFigure 11.4. Mechanical resistance of (CHI/ALG)3 macrocapsules, ECs, to incremental centrifugal \n\nstress, with two standard deviations represented. \n\n \n\nAt a maximum of 5000g, nearly every macrocapsule was disrupted, with only 5\u00b13% of samples \n\nremaining intact. The resistance to handling was also assessed by manipulating them using a Pasteur \n\nmicropipette. They can be easily and safely manipulated without disrupting the wall integrity, which is \n\nan important property when considering not only handling but also transportation or transfer between \n\ndistinct containers, and biological implantation. \n\nCompartmentalized systems may be useful for entrapping a multitude of molecular compounds with \n\ntunable permeability. Figure 11.5a shows the distribution of FITC-loaded ICs within an EC, with the \n\nlatter encapsulating Rhod.  \n\n\n\nChapter 11. Multifunctional compartmentalized capsules with a hierarchical organization from the nano- \n\nto the macro-scales \n\n \n\n376 \n\n200 \u00b5m\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c)\n\n \n\nFigure 11.5. Distribution of the (CHI/ELR)3 ICs within (CHI/ALG)3 ECs by fluorescence microscopy. \n\n(a) This image was obtained by loading the former with FITC and the latter with Rhod. Separate green \n\n(b) and red (c) filters are shown. \n\n \n\nThe separate fluorescent channels are shown (Figure 11.5b and Figure 11.5c). It is clear that the ICs \n\nare homogeneously distributed in the ALG liquefied medium, showing that a compartmentalized \n\nstructure is definitely conceived. \n\nTo further explore the permeability of the compartments, early release studies were performed by \n\nloading either the ICs or the ECs with Rhod and plotting the cumulative release of this compound from \n\nthe (CHI/ELR)3 and (CHI/ALG)3 compartments at 25\u00baC (Figure 11.6a) and 37\u00baC (Figure 11.6b) as a \n\nfunction of time. One important finding from this study was that the release of Rhod encapsulated in the \n\nICs was more sustained at 37\u00baC than at 25\u00baC (84% and 71%, respectively, after 2 h). This phenomenon \n\nresults from the temperature response of the ELR: at the temperature of 37\u00baC \u2013 above Tt \u2013 its transition \n\nto a more ordered state is triggered and is manifested by the decrease in the shell permeability, an \n\neffect previously demonstrated for CHI- and ELR-based microcapsules entrapping bovine serum \n\nalbumin (BSA) [46]. Such decreased permeability of the microcapsules can therefore be used as a \n\nmechanism to control the release of molecular compounds. As such, it could be useful in the field of \n\nsustained drug-delivery devices for targeting a therapeutic window, micro-reactors confining chemical \n\nreactions, and sensors for the simultaneous detection of macromolecules or gases by diffusion (in or \n\nout). It should also be noted that the release of Rhod from the ECs did not change significantly since \n\nCHI and ALG are not temperature responsive (90% at 25\u00baC and 92% at 37\u00baC) \n\n\n\nChapter 11 \u2013 Multifunctional compartmentalized capsules with a hierarchical organization from the \n\nnano- to the macro-scales \n\n \n\n377 \n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\nC\n\nu\nm\n\nu\nla\n\nti\nv\ne\n\n r\ne\n\nle\na\n\ns\ne\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\nt (min)\n\nIC\n\nEC\n\n25 \u00baC\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n37 \u00baCC\nu\n\nm\nu\n\nla\nti\nv\ne\n\n r\ne\n\nle\na\n\ns\ne\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\nt (min)\n\nIC\n\nEC\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nC\nu\n\nm\nu\nla\n\nti\nv\ne\n\n r\ne\nle\n\na\ns\ne\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\nt (min)\n\nIC\n\nEC\n\n25 \u00baC\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n37 \u00baCC\nu\n\nm\nu\nla\n\nti\nv\ne\n\n r\ne\nle\n\na\ns\ne\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\nt (min)\n\nIC\n\nEC\n\n \n\nFigure 11.6. Kinetics of Rhod release when encapsulated in the internal (CHI/ELR)3 microcapsules \n\n(? ) and the external (CHI/ALG)3 compartment (?) at (a) 25\u00baC and (b) 37\u00baC for a time, t, of 2 h, with \n\ntwo standard deviations represented. Some standard deviations are too small to be distinguished from \n\nthe symbol. \n\n \n\nAnother important finding was that the release of Rhod from the ICs decreased after an initial burst \n\ndetected at the first time-point. Namely, the Rhod release rate decreased between 10-20 minutes \n\n(25\u00baC) and 10\u201330 minutes (37\u00baC), with this decrease being more pronounced in the latter case. This \n\ncould be due to the fact that molecules encapsulated within the microcompartmental system have to \n\ndiffuse through the IC coating to the alginate medium and then through the external coating to the \n\nexternal environment. This would explain the existence of a time-gap that is not present when Rhod is \n\nencapsulated within the ECs. Figure 11.7 depicts the proposed mechanism for the initial burst release \n\ndetected in the IC case. \n\nWe hypothesize that this phenomenon results from the release of Rhod by diffusion into the alginate \n\nmedium during construction of the ECs containing Rhod-loaded ICs, mainly at the chelation stage. At \n\nthe start of the release studies, this fraction would behave similarly to the EC case at the first time point, \n\nwith an initial burst similar in magnitude to that of the ECs. The remaining Rhod is released from the \n\nICs at a slower rate. In this regard, in Figure 11.5 we had separated the fluorescence channels of FITC \n\nand Rhod. Indeed, immediately after construction of the multicompartmental device, there is a diffusion \n\nof FITC throughout the alginate medium, as evidenced by diffuse green zones Figure 11.5b. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 11.

Burst mechanism for Rhod loaded within internal microcompartments. (i) At first, Rhod \n\nis physically entrapped within CaCO3 templates. (ii) After chelation, a fraction of Rhod is lost and \n\nquantified. The samples are rinsed to remove the lost fraction. However, another fraction remains free \n\nwithin the alginate. (iii) At the start of the release studies, the free Rhod diffuses to the exterior and is \n\nreadily detected. ICs keep releasing Rhod to the alginate medium at a slower rate, and this Rhod is \n\ndetected later in the experiment. \n\n \n\nThe existence of two release rate constants is consistent with the \"double barrier\" effect recently \n\nevidenced by Lecommandoux and co-workers for polymersome-in-polymersome systems [47]. In their \n\nwork, doxorubicin was encapsulated in inner or outer compartments. The fabrication method differed \n\nfrom our LbL mechanism: they were fabricated by nanoprecipitation and an emulsion/centrifugation \n\nprocess, respectively. They observed lower release kinetics when doxorubicin was encapsulated within \n\nthe internal nanovesicles in comparison to the latter case. \n\nTheoretically, if such initial burst did not occur, a more prolonged time-gap would be visible from the \n\nbeginning before Rhod from the ICs could be detected. This burst-type release is not necessarily a \n\ndrawback as some applications may benefit from it. For instance, a higher fraction of antibiotics/anti-\n\ninflammatories can be released in the first few minutes after administration when they are most needed, \n\nwith the rest of the load being released subsequently within a therapeutic window. The release of more \n\nthan one molecule from a reservoir with independent and tunable rates may be important in drug \n\ndelivery systems, when the delayed delivery of one active substance with respect to another is desired, \n\nor to circumvent premature drug leakage [48]. Moreover, tuning the release rate of a molecular species \n\ncould be accomplished further by varying the number of layers of the coating: a substance could diffuse \n\nthrough the multilayers with higher release kinetics for thicker coatings, in comparison to a thinner \n\n\n\nChapter 11 \u2013 Multifunctional compartmentalized capsules with a hierarchical organization from the \n\nnano- to the macro-scales \n\n \n\n379 \n\ncoating [27,46]. Although the primary interest in compartmental devices has focused on systems for \n\nthe delivery of therapeutic molecules, other applications have been proposed in fields ranging from \n\nactuators to biomaterials for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine [18]. \n\nThe encapsulation method for CaCO3 entrapment was also used to incorporate MNPs within the ICs. \n\nFigure 11.8a shows MNPs observed by TEM homogeneously distributed within these microcapsules. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 11.8. Magnetic characteristics of the multicompartmental system. TEM of a (CHI/ELR)3 \n\nmicrocapsule (a) containing MNPs and (b) empty. Insets scale: 50 nm. (c) Attraction of (CHI/ALG)3 ECs \n\ncontaining MNP-loaded (CHI/ELR)3 ICs by a magnet in a PBS medium. The magnet is placed at a \n\nheight of 1.4 cm on top of a polystyrene cover. The red color is characteristic of the MNPs within the \n\nhierarchical structure. Squares are 1\u00d71 cm\n2\n. \n\n \n\nEmpty microcapsules were used as a control for MNP-loaded ones. In comparison, Figure 11.8b shows \n\nempty ICs, where no spherical structure could be detected. As they are empty and the electronic \n\ndensity is lower than MNP-containing ICs, the multilayer shell can be discerned, with creases and folds \n\nwhich are characteristic of collapsed ultrathin walls due to the drying process. \n\nIn light of our initial findings, we conducted an experiment where MNP-containing ICs were loaded into \n\nECs and attracted by a magnet placed at a distance of 3 cm (Figure 11.8c). This strategy adds further \n\nvalue to the proposed device in terms of biomimetism. Besides its multicompartmental nature inspired \n\nby natural cells and self-assembly mechanism of constituents in which the LbL strategy is based upon, \n\nthe use of MNPs can be considered to be a biomimetic approach inspired by unique structures with \n\nmagnetic properties, such as magnetotactic bacteria [49-51]. Magnetic alginate beads have been used \n\npreviously for applications such as water pollution remediation [52] and magnetic hyperthermia-\n\nenhanced doxorubicin release [53], although the magnetic character was not exploited primarily for \n\n\n\nChapter 11.

It took 42 s for all the beads to travel this distance and be completely immobilized. \n\nAs soon as the magnetic compartmental units were exposed to the external magnetic field, they \n\nbecame attracted to the position at which the maximum magnetic field value was available to them at \n\nthe surface of the PBS medium. As they got closer to the magnet they were exposed to a stronger \n\nmagnetic field and the attraction increased. Movement stopped abruptly once they reached the position \n\nbelow where the magnet was placed. The normalized mean distance traveled by MNP-loaded ICs within \n\nECs is represented in Supplemental Figure 11.4. This observation shows how the internal \n\nsubcompartments can be customized to possess distinct functions, including distinct types of smart \n\nresponsiveness. Specifically, the entrapment of superparamagnetic nanoparticles within microcapsules \n\ncould be envisaged for applications that require immobilization, such as localized therapies, and \n\nmagnetic resonance imaging. The developed devices should also permit the incorporation of living \n\nmicroorganisms and cells inside the EC, as its processing is performed in mild conditions [39]. \n\n11.4 Conclusion \n\nIn conclusion, we presented a multifunctional system characterized by hierarchical organized spherical \n\ncompartments. We showed that compartmentalized structures delimited by multilayer coatings can be \n\ncustomized to exhibit properties that are not found coupled in nature. Although the present work was \n\nlimited to the proof of concept, we envisage that it can be improved in the future. Namely, the \n\nmultilayer organization makes it possible to tune the permeability of the coatings just by changing the \n\nnumber of layers. Other stimuli could be coupled together: for instance, temperature, pH or light (e.g., \n\nfrom the incorporation of azobenzenes or spiropyrans) could be combined for multifunctional \n\nbiosensors confining reactions. The genetic nature of ELRs further allows synthesizing biofunctional \n\npolypeptides for advanced applications, such as increased cell adhesion or enhanced biomineralization. \n\nCells have been previously encapsulated within alginate beads, but we envision that coupling biological \n\nmaterial with functionality such as controlled release of growth factors and provision of adhesion sites \n\nmay improve cellular sustained survivability over time. Moreover, the addition of magnetic components \n\nprovides such compartmentalized system potential for biotechnological and biomedical applications \n\nwhere spatial immobilization, high local availability of an active agent or monitoring by magnetic \n\nimaging is required. \n\n\n\nChapter 11 \u2013 Multifunctional compartmentalized capsules with a hierarchical organization from the \n\nnano- to the macro-scales \n\n \n\n381 \n\n11.5 Supplemental information \n\n11.5.1 Deacetylation degree of chitosan. \n\nHydrogen-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (\n1\nH-NMR) spectra were recorded using a Varian MR-400 \n\nspectrometer to determine the degree of deacetylation (DD) of chitosan. Thus, 10 mg of chitosan was \n\ndissolved in 1 mL of deuterated water (D2O) and 20 \u00b5L of deuterated hydrochloric acid (DCl) to form a \n\nviscous solution. An aliquot of this solution was placed in a 5 mm NMR tube and the spectrum recorded \n\nat 60\u00b0C. \n\nThe calculation of the DD is presented in Supplemental equation 11.1: \n\n100\n\n6\n\n1\n3\n\n1\n\n1(%) ?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n??\n\nc\n\ne\n\nI\n\nI\n\nDD   (11.1) \n\nwhere Ix is the area of each of the peaks (x) identified in Supplemental Figure 11.1. The DD of the \n\npurified chitosan used was 81.6%. \n\n11.5.2 ELR transition temperature \n\nThe aggregate sizes of ELR in solution were measured using a Nano-ZS from Malvern (United Kingdom) \n\nin the temperature range 25\u201337\u00b0C after stabilization for 5 min. Samples were prepared at \n\n300 \u00b5g?mL\n-1\n\n in PBS, pH 7.4. A total of 20 runs were performed for each sample to obtain an average \n\nvalue at stabilized temperature. \n\nIn order to evaluate the thermal response of the featured ELR, the size variations of peptide aggregates \n\nin aqueous solution were measured as a function of temperature in small increments. It can be seen \n\nfrom Supplemental Figure 11.2 that the ELR forms aggregates of 4.4\u00b12.8 nm at 25\u00baC and \n\n1290\u00b1113 nm at 29\u00baC. This abrupt size variation gives a Tt of 29\u00baC for the ELR. ELR self-assembly \n\nprogresses further with increasing temperature \n\n\n\nChapter 11.

Thus, 150 ?L of sample was pipetted into white, opaque \n\n96-well plates in triplicate. Ultrapure water was used as blank. The excitation (?exc) and emission (?em) \n\nwavelengths used for Rhod mass calculations were 530 and 590 nm, respectively. All supernatants \n\ncollected during entrapment, construction and chelation stages were measured and quantified. The \n\npercentage Rhod loss was plotted for both each stage and cumulatively. \n\nAll the supernatants collected during the construction of Rhod-loaded compartments (either internal or \n\nexternal ones) were used to calculate the losses occurred prior to the commencement of the actual \n\nrelease studies. The graphic in Supplemental Figure 11.3 shows the stage and cumulative Rhod losses \n\nwith respect to the initial encapsulated mass. \n\n \n\nIC EC\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n85.3% of 100 ?g\n\nE\nn\n\ntr\na\n\np\nm\n\ne\nn\n\nt \n(%\n\n)\n\nLocation of the rhodamine loading\n\n Chelation\n\n EC build-up\n\n IC build-up\n\n Entrapment\n\n47% of 15 ?g\n\n \n\nSupplemental Figure 11.3. Rhodamine losses during the construction of Rhod-loaded \n\nmicrocapsules (ICs) within macrocapsules (ECs) and empty microcapsules within Rhod-loaded \n\nmacrocapsules, with two standard deviations represented. \n\n \n\nWhen Rhod was loaded within the inner compartments, the construction process consisted of four \n\nstages: (i) entrapment within the CaCO3 particles (orange in the graphic), (ii) buildup of the (CHI/ELR)3 \n\nmultilayer (yellow), (iii) buildup of the external (CHI/ALG)3 multilayer (purple), and (iv) simultaneous \n\n\n\nChapter 11. Multifunctional compartmentalized capsules with a hierarchical organization from the nano- \n\nto the macro-scales \n\n \n\n384 \n\nCaCO3 chelation and alginate bead liquefaction (grey). When Rhod was loaded within the external \n\ncompartments, losses are only present in stages (iii) and (iv), when Rhod is introduced into the system. \n\nThe sacrificial template was maintained until the end of stage (iii) to prevent early diffusion during the \n\nconstruction. Thus, Rhod could be protected and physically retained within the sacrificial template until \n\nthe final stage of chelation. \n\nAs mentioned previously, the quantity of Rhod loaded initially differed depending on whether it was \n\nencapsulated within the internal or the external compartments. As a result, we first quantified the Rhod \n\nlosses during the construction of ECs containing Rhod-loaded ICs and found that 85% of Rhod had been \n\nlost at the end of the construction, thus meaning that only 15 ?g of the initial 100 ?g were effectively \n\nencapsulated at time-point \u201c0\u201d. In an attempt to encapsulate roughly the same mass of fluorophore in \n\nthe ECs, we loaded them with the equivalent quantity of 15 ?g of Rhod during the ionic gelation step of \n\n1 mL of alginate. Note that this value disregards the subsequent loss of 47% that was further quantified \n\nfollowing liquefaction of the bead. Furthermore, empty CaCO3-coated particles were loaded at the same \n\ntime to keep the same subcompartmental structure. \n\n11.5.4 Magnetic responsiveness assay \n\nFigure 11.8c depicted the magnetic responsiveness of the MNP-loaded ICs within ECs.

Major conclusion and future perspectives \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 12 \u2013 Major conclusion and future perspectives \n\n \n\n393 \n\n Chapter 12. Major conclusions and future perspectives \n\nThe surface modification technique known as layer-by-layer (LbL) was employed successfully in \n\naccordance to the hypothesis of this thesis. Various substrates \u2013 both planar and three-dimensional \u2013 \n\nwere coated with natural or biomimetic polymeric constituents distinct in functionality but sharing \n\nnatural roots. It was then possible to develop multilayer devices intended for a wide range of biomedical \n\napplications, namely adhesive films, coatings for biomaterials, drug delivery carriers \u2013 for delivery either \n\nby drug diffusion or by cellular uptake \u2013 and microreactors with customizable properties. \n\nFirst, it was demonstrated that multilayer films can retain and exhibit the properties of their natural \n\nconstituents. A phosphonate derivative of levan, a fructose polymer obtained from extremophilic \n\nmicroorganisms, allowed fabricating multilayer films with chitosan (CHI) that exhibited superior \n\nadhesive properties in comparison to a multilayer formulation of CHI and alginate (ALG) \u2013 two \n\npolysaccharides of marine origin widely regarded as good adhesive ingredients. The advantage of using \n\nlevan was also evident by the superior cell adhesion to films containing this polymer, in comparison to \n\nCHI/ALG films. Future developments of levan-functionalized multilayer films may include tests using \n\nactual animal tissues to further evaluate their potential as wound healing coatings and tissue sealants \n\nfor post-surgical procedures. \n\nElastin-like recombinamers (ELRs) were used as a polypeptide constituent of most multilayer \n\nformulations presented herein. Its genetic origin, rooted in natural elastin, allowed using constituents \n\nexhibiting a precise amino acid content, sequence, length, and, most importantly, bioactivity. By using \n\nan ELR containing the bioactive sequence arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD), substrates with \n\nenhanced cell adhesion were made. Given the multiple stimuli-responsive nature of ELRs, it was \n\ndemonstrated that, like in the case of levan, films containing these polypeptides also retained such \n\nresponsiveness, namely toward temperature, pH and ionic strength. Raising any of these parameters \n\nabove an upper threshold triggered the transition of the ELR adsorbed at the surface, leading it to \n\nexhibit charged amino acids toward the interface. This phenomenon was translated by an increase of \n\nhydrophilicity and surface roughness. \n\nThe buildup feasibility of this ELR-RGD with CHI in a multilayer structure was monitored in situ using a \n\nquartz-crystal microbalance (QCM). Although a construction based on strong electrostatic interactions \n\nwas first anticipated, there was evidence that weaker hydrophobic interactions could play an important \n\nrole in this process between polysaccharides and polypeptide-based polymers. Resorting to the QCM \n\n\n\nChapter 12 \u2013 Major conclusion and future perspectives \n\n394 \n\nand the mathematical Voigt-based model for viscoelastic films, several distinct ELRs were combined \n\nwith either CHI or ALG for the construction of hybrid films at distinct values of pH. The estimation of \n\neach of the films\u2019 thicknesses led to the conclusion that not only electrostatic but also hydrophobic \n\ninteractions drive the self-assembly of this type of multilayer films, judging by how thicker films could be \n\nobtained when using partially neutralized polysaccharides. This result provides a consistent basis to the \n\ndevelopment of future devices based on this class of coatings by ensuring that the best construction \n\nparameters are used in order to achieve thick films across various scales \u2013 nano to micro \u2013 and \n\nstability. \n\nLbL extrapolation to 3D was successful in the form of spherical microcapsules of CHI and ELR for the \n\npurpose of drug delivery, envisaging two forms of administration. The first consisted in the \n\npre-encapsulation of a high molecular weight protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), within the \n\nmicrocapsules and its release by diffusion under distinct temperatures. It was demonstrated that the \n\npermeability of the multilayer shell was dependent on the temperature and on the number of layers. \n\nThanks to the incorporation of ELRs in the multilayer formulation, its temperature-triggered phase \n\ntransition led the microcapsules to be more retentive at physiological than at room temperature, a \n\nphenomenon also accompanied by a significant shrinkage of the capsular structures. As expected, a \n\nhigher number of coating layers also provided a more effective barrier to the diffusion of the \n\nencapsulated agent. The reduced release rate verified at physiological temperature may help in the \n\ndelivery of active agents (e.g., chemotherapeutics) that are necessary locally in small but controlled \n\ndoses, i.e., within a therapeutic window. Varying the number of layers provided an additional means of \n\ncontrol over the release kinetics, what helps further to achieve an appropriate drug release and \n\nbioactivity. Future developments may investigate the potential use of these carriers for the delivery of \n\nactive agents instead of model proteins for a wide spectrum of molecular weights. Ideally, these should \n\nbe studied under sink conditions, which ensure that the release medium is not saturated by drug so \n\nthat its release is controlled solely by the delivery system and is not affected by its solubility. \n\nThe second mechanism consisted in the delivery of microcapsules directly to the interior of the cells, \n\nwhere the whole cellular machinery is located. Using RGD- and RDG-functionalized microcapsules (with \n\nthe latter being a nonfunctional analogue of the former) it was possible to determine that the \n\nmechanism of internalization of these capsules by human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) was due \n\nmajorly to a mechanism of macropinocytosis and not due to the surface functionalization. This is an \n\nimportant mechanism of drug delivery since the delivery of drug carriers directly to the cells diminishes \n\npotential active agent losses to the extracellular environment by diffusion. Furthermore, drugs may be \n\n\n\nChapter 12 \u2013 Major conclusion and future perspectives \n\n \n\n395 \n\ndelivered to where they are most needed, ensuring a high drug availability and efficacy. However, the \n\nintracellular degradation \u2013 hence potential drug availability \u2013 was faster for RGD-functionalized \n\nmicrocapsules. Future experiments may focus on determining the mechanism behind the distinct \n\nintracellular processing rates, which seemed dependent on the surface functionalization of the \n\nmicrocapsules. Furthermore, growth factors and other differentiation agents may be encapsulated to \n\nexploit stem cell differentiation mechanisms dependent on controllable dosages and carrier size. \n\nFinally, it was shown that LbL allows achieving higher levels of functionalization, difficult to achieve \n\nusing the most conventional surface modification strategies. Macrocapsules observable with a naked \n\neye were delimited by CHI/ALG multilayers. This macrodevice exhibited compartmentalization and \n\nhierarchical organization from the nano- to the macro-scales. ELR-functionalized microcapsules served \n\nas microcompartments suspended within a confined ALG liquefied environment. The microcapsules \n\ncould be loaded with magnetic nanoparticles, which provided the possibility to guide spatially the whole \n\ncompartmentalized structure by applying an external magnetic field, which could be useful in \n\napplications that require mobilization to and immobilization at a site (e.g., guided therapies). \n\nCompartmentalization was exploited to encapsulate rhodamine as a model low molecular weight \n\nmolecule either in the interior of the microcapsules or in the ALG medium. Release studies at distinct \n\ntemperatures showed that rhodamine when encapsulated in the microcapsules was released at a lower \n\nrate at physiological temperature, thanks to the use of ELRs. When encapsulated in the ALG \n\ncompartment, the release kinetics was not significantly affected. Incorporating distinct functions in a \n\nsame system by carefully selecting its constituents lets foresee the construction of customizable \n\nmicroreactors that may exhibit other types of response, for instance, toward temperature, pH or light. \n\nSuch a device could also be used as a platform for the development of microenvironments that \n\nsimulate the formation of microtissues or the treatment of diseases at a laboratorial level. \n\nThe work developed herein shows how LbL-based strategies have surpassed the simple purpose of \n\nmodifying a surface. From the results obtained in each of the chapters of this thesis, it is clear that LbL \n\npermits to achieve high degrees of functionalization and complexity, both in bioactivity and geometry, \n\nfor various distinct biomedical applications. Despite the potential of LbL, this technology has been \n\nlimited to the fabrication of bidimensional devices \u2013 some already in medical use. Thus, it is expected \n\nthat the superior functionalization may result in the development of strategies useful not only for \n\nconventional medical applications but also more cutting-edge ones in biomedical engineering, such as \n\ntissue engineering. \n\n \n\n\n\tP\u00e1gina 1\n\tP\u00e1gina 2\n\tP\u00e1gina 3\n\tP\u00e1gina 4"}]}}}
