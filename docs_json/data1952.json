A capacitance measurement system is proposed to measure thin water films near to the wall pipe. A planar sensor was chosen for sensing and some geometries were compared using finite elements method (FEM). The penetration depth, the sensitivity, the minimum spatial resolution (high spatial resolution) and the quasi-linear curve were the analyzed characteristics. Dispersed and unstable-annular oil-water flows patterns were studied in a 12-m long vertical glass pipe, with 50.8 mm of internal diameter, using mineral oil (828 kg/m3 of density and 220 mPa s of viscosity) and tap water. The experimental work was carried out in the multiphase-flow facilities of The Thermal-Fluids Engineering Laboratory (NETeF) of EESC-USP. Experiments with a high-speed video camera and the proposed capacitance system were performed to obtain images of the oil-water flow near the pipe wall. A pre-processing enhancement algorithm and a combined segmentation algorithm are proposed and allowed the measurement of characteristic space and time averaged water film thickness. Experimental results of the capacitive technique showed that the system could measure thickness between 400 |im and 2200 |im. It was possible to recognize and characterize typical behaviors of the two different flow patterns studied. Unstable-annular flow can be described by huge fluctuations on the flow direction and perimeter direction, and big interfacial structures (drops). On the other hand, dispersed flow has tiny fluctuations on the flow direction and perimeter direction, and smaller interfacial structures (droplets). A typical interfacial topology is observed near the pipe wall and it can be treated as an interface between wall and core regions. It is analyzed in time and frequency domains: amplitude, velocity and wavelength quantities can be related to the collected signal at each pair transmitter-receiver of the studied sensor. Correlations for the interfacial-structure velocity were found for dispersed oil-in-water flow and unstableannular flow.\nKey Word: Liquid-Liquid Flow, Film Thickness Measurement, Capacitive Sensor, Planar sensor, Oil-Water Flow.\nxiv\nRESUMO\nNeste trabalho, \u00e9 apresentado o desenvolvimento de uma nova t\u00e9cnica para a medi\u00e7\u00e3o da espessura do filme de \u00e1gua com alta resolu\u00e7\u00e3o espacial e temporal em escoamento \u00f3leo-\u00e1gua. \u00c9 proposto o uso de um sistema de medi\u00e7\u00e3o de capacit\u00e2ncia el\u00e9trica para medir filmes finos de \u00e1gua na proximidade da parede do tubo. O sistema conta com um sensor planar e foi necess\u00e1rio determinar a melhor geometria via simula\u00e7\u00f5es baseadas no M\u00e9todo de Elementos Finitos (FEM) para o caso de escoamento \u00f3leo-\u00e1gua. As caracter\u00edsticas comparadas foram a profundidade de penetra\u00e7\u00e3o do campo el\u00e9trico no filme de \u00e1gua, a sensibilidade, a resolu\u00e7\u00e3o espacial m\u00ednima e a resposta quase-linear. Padr\u00f5es de escoamento \u00f3leo-\u00e1gua disperso e anular inst\u00e1vel foram estudados numa tubula\u00e7\u00e3o vertical de 12 m de comprimento, feita de vidro, com 50,8 mil\u00edmetros de di\u00e2metro interno. Os fluidos usados foram \u00f3leo mineral (com densidade 828 kg/m3 e viscosidade 220 mPas) e \u00e1gua da torneira. O trabalho experimental foi realizado nas instala\u00e7\u00f5es de escoamento multif\u00e1sico do Laborat\u00f3rio de Engenharia T\u00e9rmica e Fluidos (NETeF) da EESC-USP. Foi medida a espessura m\u00e9dia do filme de \u00e1gua usando o sistema capacitivo e uma c\u00e2mera de v\u00eddeo de alta velocidade. Para obter a espessura do filme de \u00e1gua a partir das imagens, foi proposto um algoritmo de pr\u00e9-processamento e um algoritmo de segmenta\u00e7\u00e3o que combina v\u00e1rios m\u00e9todos dispon\u00edveis na literatura. Os resultados experimentais do sensor capacitivo mostraram que o sistema pode medir espessuras entre 400 pm e 2200 pm. O escoamento anular inst\u00e1vel \u00e9 caracterizado por grandes flutua\u00e7\u00f5es na no sentido do escoamento e na dire\u00e7\u00e3o do per\u00edmetro, e estruturas interfaciais grandes (gotas). Por sua vez, o escoamento disperso tem flutua\u00e7\u00f5es menores no sentido do escoamento e na dire\u00e7\u00e3o do per\u00edmetro, e estruturas interfaciais menores (got\u00edculas). Uma topologia interfacial t\u00edpica \u00e9 observada na regi\u00e3o pr\u00f3xima \u00e0 parede do tubo e pode ser tratada como uma interface entre a regi\u00e3o pr\u00f3xima \u00e0 parede do tubo e a regi\u00e3o do n\u00facleo. A an\u00e1lise da interface foi feita no dom\u00ednio do tempo e da frequ\u00eancia: grandezas como amplitude, velocidade e comprimento da onda podem ser relacionadas ao sinal coletado em cada par transmissor-receptor do sensor. Foi poss\u00edvel estabelecer correla\u00e7\u00f5es para a velocidade das estruturas interfaciais em escoamento de \u00f3leo em \u00e1gua.\nPalavras Chave: Escoamento Liquido-Liquido,

Fossil fuels are expected to continue supplying much of the energy used worldwide (Figure 1.1) (U.S. ENERGY INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION, 2013) and many of these resources are harder to produce at the present than in the past. The production difficulties are due in part to oil reservoirs localization, i.e. most of them are offshore, at great depths under the sea, and in some cases, to the high oil viscosity. Heavy oil represents a significant quantity of the total oil world reserves (SANTOS et al., 2014). Oil is classified as heavy oils when its viscosity is higher than 100 centipoise (cP). Some challenges in the heavy oil recovery from reservoirs are the high flow resistance, the pressure drop, the necessity of heating and dilution during transporting, and the inherent increased costs. This scenario has created an interest in researching new technologies, with the suitable characteristics, to improve the recovery factor of heavy oil fields (BANNWART, 2001).\nFigure 1.1 - World marketed energy use by fuel type (U.S. ENERGY INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION, 2013).\nParticularly, there is a growing attention on methods or technologies to improve the heavy oil transportation process. The methods should be focus on decreasing flow resistance to enough\nlow values that the pumping requirements and pipeline size will guarantee that the process will be economically viable (SANTOS et al., 2014). Lubricated transportation, using core-annular flow and reverse emulsion (oil-in-water emulsion), has been used to reduce the effects of frictional pressure loss caused by the viscous effects and the application in in heavy oil transportation is promising (BANNWART, 2001; BANNWART et al., 2011).\nGiven the relevance of lubricated transportation of heavy oil and the lack of understanding as far as the associated hydrodynamic phenomena are concerned, the goal of this research is to study a recently developed instrument and apply it for the first time in oil-water flow to study the flow near the pipe wall, where thin films are usually observed.\n1.1\tCore-Annular Flow\nIn core-annular flow, a water flow is injected in the pipe in a way that an annular flow pattern is generated, with water near the wall surrounding an oil core. The water flow avoids the oil from sticking to the pipe wall. Therefore, the wall shear stress is comparable to that observed in single-phase water flow, resulting in a significant decrease of the pressure drop due to friction. The more viscous the oil, the more intense the pressure-drop reduction. According to experimental studies, for the core-annular flow pattern to occur it is necessary that the core phase is much more viscous than the annular phase and that the volume fraction of the latter is lower than that of the former (BANNWART, 2001). In some works, geometrical and kinematic characteristics of the annular film have been studied, for example, Oliemans et al. (1987), Bannwart (1998) and Rodriguez &amp; Bannwart (2006). However, works devoted to the study of detailed film topological properties and their relation with the hydrodynamic stability of the coreannular flow pattern have not been found in the literature.\n1.2\tDispersed Oil-in-Water Flow (Reverse Emulsion)\nDispersed oil-in-water flow pattern, where oil is dispersed as droplets into the water-dominated flow, is common in crude oil transportation (MARTINEZ-PALOU et al., 2011). An interesting feature of this two-phase flow pattern is the drag reduction phenomenon, the pressure drop reaching values than can be even lower than those observed in single-phase water flow. The occurrence of drag reduction without the addition of any drag-reduction agent in dispersed flow\nhas been reported in some works (PAL, 2007; OMER &amp; PAL, 2010; ANGELI &amp; HEWITT, 1998; LOVICK &amp; ANGELI, 2004b; IOANNOU et al., 2005; RODR\u00cdGUEZ et al., 2012), but it has not been well understood yet. For instance, Rodriguez et al. (2012) observed a pressure-drop reduction of up to 25% in a viscous oil-water dispersed flow.\nOne can see in Figure 1.2 the Drag Reduction Factor, (DRF = \u2014 ( dpIdx) mtxture/ \u2014( dp/ dx)water), as a function of the oil cut for a 26 mm I.D. acrylic pipe; drag reduction was observed for water superficial velocities higher than 2.0 m/s (RODRIGUEZ, 2014). A phenomenological model that assumes the existence of a thin water film adjacent to the pipe wall was proposed to explain the drag-reduction mechanism, but it lacks experimental confirmation. The model uses pressure-drop, holdup data and physical properties of the fluids to estimate the water film thickness, see Rodriguez et al. (2012).\nFigure 1.2 - Drag Reduction Factor (DRF) in acrylic pipe for high water superficial velocities (RODRIGUEZ, 2014).\ntime-averaged thickness, 6, is adopted in this work. In Figure 1.3 one can see an illustration of the dispersed oil-in-water flow; the blue line indicates the water film approximation that is considered by hypothesis in this work. The blue line represents the time and space-averaged water-film boundary that separates the water-film wall region (annulus) from the oil-in-water mixture (core). This pragmatic model is chosen since it allows the measurement of time and space-averaged water-film thickness with simplicity through both optical and electricalimpedance techniques. In addition, the water-film thickness is measured in core-annular flow as well.\nFigure 1.3 - Illustration of the water-film region near the pipe wall in dispersed oil-in-water flow.\nIt is relevant to point out that several measurement techniques have been developed for the investigation of multiphase flows. Moreover, the existing literature covers mainly applications in gas-liquid, and liquid-liquid flows using liquids with low viscosity (close to the water viscosity). These techniques are not always appropriate for viscous liquids.\n1.3\tObjectives\nThe main goal of this research project is to develop new experimental techniques to study water films in viscous-oil-water flow.\nThe following aims are proposed:\n1)\tLiterature review of dispersed and core-annular flow with special attention paid to liquid films and measurements.\n2)\tLiterature review of multiphase-flow instrumentation, especially impedance-based sensors, with special attention paid to applications in liquid-liquid flow.\n3)\tTest and characterization of a new liquid-film-thickness measurement system with high temporal and high spatial resolution.\n4)\tApplication of the measurement system and development of an experimental methodology for the investigation of film characteristics, such as topology and velocity.\n5)\tAcquisition of new oil-water flow data of turbulent fully dispersed oil-in-water flow.\n6)\tDevelopment of techniques for image and signal processing to visualize and analyze the data, respectively.\n1.4\tOverview of the Research\nThis thesis is divided into seven chapters, including this introduction. Chapter 2 presents a literature review on flow patterns in vertical oil-water flows, models and experimental studies on core-annular and dispersed flow, interfacial waves and multiphase-flow instrumentation. Chapter 3 provides details on the experimental set-up, facilities, equipment, instrumentation, test fluids and Finite Elements Method simulations setup. Chapter 4 presents the proposed measurement system and the experimental procedures. In Chapter 5, the development of a methodology for film-thickness measurements using high-speed camera images is presented. In Chapter 6, experimental results, including finite element method (FEM) simulation results and capacitance sensor results, the interfacial structure is studied using the proposed measurement-system data and the high-speed-camera image data. A summary of this research and recommendations for future work are given in Chapter 7.\n6\n2\tLITERATURE REVIEW\nIn the next sections are reviewed the basic definitions of liquid-liquid flow and flow patterns, such as core-annular and dispersed flows. Moreover, a review of techniques for measurement of film thickness in oil-water pipe flow is presented.\n2.1\tBasic Definitions of Liquid-Liquid Flow\nConsidering oil and water flowing in a vertical pipe with cross-section area . The input volumetric flow rates of oil and water are q0 and qw, respectively (SHOHAM, 2006). The input volumetric oil and water fractions are given by:\nCo-\t.\t(2.1)\nQ + Qw\t\nc -\tQw\t(2.2)\nQ + Qw\t\nwhere refers usually also to water cut .\nSuperficial velocities of oil and water are sectional area of the pipe and are defined by:\nbased on the input flow rates and the cross\nV\t-\t(2.3)\nso A\nV\t=\u2014\t(2.4)\nsw\tV Z\nThe in-situ velocity is different from the superficial velocity because the velocity is calculated from the volumetric flow rate passing a smaller area than the cross sectional area. If the cross section areas occupied by oil and water are respectively and , the in-situ velocities can be calculated as:\no\nw\n(2.5)\n(2.6)\nIf one considers volume fraction as being area averaged quantity, then oil holdup and water holdup, h0 and hw can be written as\nho = \\,\t(2-7)\nA\nh, = A .\t(2-8)\nA\nHowever, holdup measurements are usually obtained via the collecting of volumes, rather than on cross-sections, then the volumetric holdups are defined as\nh0 =\nVol.\nVolT\n(2-9)\nVolT \u2019\n(2-10)\nh, =\nwhere and\tare the volumes of oil and water, respectively and is a given total\nvolume:\nVolo +Volw = VolT.\t(2.11)\nThe mixture velocity is defined by dividing the total volumetric flow by the cross sectional area of the pipe:\nqo + q,\nA\n(2.12)\nNotice that the mixture velocity can also be given by:\nV = V + V .\t(2.13)\nm\tso\tsw\tv\tz\nThe slip ratio (S) is defined as a relation between the two phases\u2019 in-situ velocities and it is defined as (RODR\u00cdGUEZ et al., 2011):\nV\tAV\ng _ o _ w so\nV\tAV\nAoVsw\t(2.14)\nIf the slip ratio is greater than 1, it means that the oil flows faster than water; while if S is less than 1, it shows that the water is the faster phase. For same phases\u2019 velocities, S = 1.\nAnother parameter used in oil-water flow is the drag-reduction factor (DRF). DRF is the ratio between the measured two-phase flow pressure gradient and the equivalent single-phase water pressure gradient at same mixture flow rate.\nDRF =\nm\n(2.15)\n1j\nft)\nwhere ( dp I d x) m is the pressure drop of the oil-water flow and ( d p I d x) w is the pressure drop of single-phase water flow at same mixture flow rate of the oil-water flow. If the pressure gradient of oil-water flow is lower than that of single-phase water, the DRF is &lt;1, which indicates drag reduction (RODR\u00cdGUEZ et al., 2011).\n2.2\tFlow patterns in Oil-Water Vertical Flow\nMany aspects influence the flow patterns, as fluid properties, flow rates, pipe geometry and orientation and operational conditions (e.g. temperature and flow direction). They influence quantities such as heat and momentum transfer capabilities, pressure gradient and mass transfer. Each flow pattern has its own hydrodynamic characteristics, therefore it is necessary to identify it a priory for better predicting oil-water flow behavior.\nThe oil-water flow patterns in an upward vertical pipe flow can be grouped into two categories: water-dominated flow (oil-in-water flow) and oil-dominated flow (water-in-oil flow) (FLORES et al., 1997).

In most of the reported studies, the identification of flow pattern has been based on visual 10\nobservations, high speed photographic and impedance probes. The classifications of flow pattern are subjective and often different from one another. It is important to note that a classification that covers the entire range of possible oil viscosities has not yet been reached.\nTable 2.1 - Experimental studies about oil-water flow patterns in vertical pipes\nReference\tDiameter (mm)\tOil viscosity (mPa.s)\tDefined patterns\tPattern recognition technique\nGovier et al.

Water is injected in the pipe so that it flows as an annular film adjacent to the pipe wall, whereas oil flows in the core region, Figure 2.4. Water keeps the oil\nfrom sticking to the pipe wall; therefore the wall shear is comparable to that of single phase water\nflow. This reduces the required pumping power and the operational costs (GHOSH et al., 2009).\nFigure 2.4 - Core-annular flow pattern.\nThe physical model of a two-phase flow is formed by a system of mathematical equations dependent on the flow conditions. In addition, constitutive relations are necessary to describe the mass exchange, momentum and energy transfer between the phases and the contours (walls). The constitutive relations also are dependent on the flow conditions. State equations, initial and boundary conditions are also required.\nOne can see in Table 2.2 a summary of studies on annular flow in pipes; most of them are experimental works in horizontal pipes. There are few works focused on the measurement of water film thickness.\nOliemans et al. (1987) performed experiments and proposed models for holdup and pressure drop prediction. They proposed a modified lubrication film model by incorporating the effect of turbulence in the water annulus. The authors presented empirical correlations to predict holdup and wavelength of the oil-water interface.\nBai et al. (1992) performed core-annular flow experiments. The most important result was the characterization of the bamboo waves in upflow and corkscrew waves in downflow. It was observed a pressure reduction of 200 times using core flow in comparison with single-phase oil flow. The experimental results were compared with predictions of the linear theory of stability and perfect core-annular flow theory.\nTable 2.2 - Summary of Experimental Studies on oil-water annular flow in pipes.\nReference\tVso (m/s) and Vsw (m/s)\tOil viscosity (cP)\tOrientation and diameter (mm)\tMeasurements\tMeters\nOliemans et al.

(1993). The main contribution of the work is a correlation to estimate the holdup. Pressure drop and holdup values are also presented. An important finding is than when the oil sticks to the pipe wall the pressure drop increases, producing a corresponding rise in the friction factor.\nIn Bannwart (1998), it is presented a study of the speed of interfacial waves observed in core-annular flow of viscous oil and water. The horizontal and vertical experiments are compared with the kinematic wave theory. The theory provides information on the wave speed, the slip ratio and volumetric fraction of the core. The theory results have very good agreement with experimental data. It was developed a general correlation for the volumetric fraction of the core in core-annular flow at low viscosity ratio. The proposed correlation includes the effect of fluid properties and can be applied to upward, downward and horizontal flows.\nBai &amp; Joseph (2000) presented a perturbation theory for flow and interface shapes of a highly viscous dispersed phase in core-annular flow. The theoretical results were compared with the experimental results. The theory was able to give a good description of the bamboo waves under certain conditions.\nRodriguez &amp; Bannwart (2006) proposed a correlation for oil holdup estimation in fully developed core-annular flow, which considers the presence of interfacial waves and turbulent water flow. Furthermore, an experimental study on interfacial waves observed in core flow was made. The measured parameters were wave speed, wave length, amplitude and wave profile of interfacial waves, oil holdup and holdup ratio. The holdup was measured indirectly by measuring the speed of interfacial waves. This method presented good agreement with a direct optical measurement method. An important conclusion is that the oil core always flows faster than the water annulus in upward vertical flow.\nGrassi et al. (2008) made an experimental work with the objective of validate theoretical models for core-annular and oil-in-water dispersion. The chosen models were the two-fluid model for core-annular flow and homogenous model for oil-in-water dispersion. Both models were found effective to predict the pressure gradients with an accuracy of 20%.\nSotgia et al. (2008) studied oil-water flow in seven different pipes with diameters between 21 to 40 mm. The results obtained were compared to empirical laws, theoretical findings and experimental results by different authors of the literature. The studied parameters were pressure drop, flow patterns and transitions and pressure reduction in core-annular flow. The authors 14\nconcluded that the peak of pressure reduction is near to the transition between the annular and stratified flow regimes. An empirical law for the location of the annular/stratified transition was proposed.\nPressure drop in core-annular flow was studied in two different experimental setups by Rodriguez et al. (2009). The authors proposed a model for pressure-loss prediction in coreannular flow. The model was compared with other models and data in the literature and full-scale experimental data. It was reported an important decrease in pressure drop in the full-scale experiments.\nThe behavior of oil-water flow going through sudden contraction or expansion is studied in Balakhrisna et al. (2010). Flow patterns are observed for high viscous and low viscous oils. Three flow patterns were identified: core-annular flow, oil dispersed flow and plug flow. It was shown that the pressure profiles depend on the change of area and fluid viscosities. The pressure drop is less intense for core-annular flow than for other flow patterns.\nIn Strazza, Grassi, et al. (2011) it is presented an experimental study on oil-water coreannular flow in horizontal and inclined systems, particularly are shown flow maps, pressure drop and holdup data. Some theoretical models to predict core-annular flow existence limits and pressure drops are compared to the experimental results. The pressure gradient reduction for heavy oils transportation is remarkable.\nStrazza, Demori, et al. (2011) developed a capacitance probe for holdup measurements in core-annular flow. The results were compared with quick closing valves and a capacitance model of the fluids with good agreement. In Strazza &amp; Poesio (2012) it is presented a study of the startup of core-annular flow from a stratified arrangement, focusing on the pressure drop and using water to clean the pipe up. It is measured the maximum pressure drop that occurs during start-up and the time required to remove the thin layer of oil stuck to the pipe wall. A comparison between the experimental data and a model available in literature was made.\n2.3.1\tHoldup Prediction for Annular Flow\nSome empirical relations for holdup determination are presented in Table 2.3.\nTable 2.3 - Empirical relations for holdup in oil-water annular flow\nReference\tHoldup Correlation\nOliemans et al.

(2009)\tThe holdup can obtained from the solution of the equation: Vso(1-ho)-1.17V,ho -0.02h^0.\n2.4\tDispersed Oil-in-Water Flow\nThe oil-in-water dispersed flow pattern, where the oil is dispersed as droplets into the water (Figure 2.5), occurs in liquid-liquid pipe flow at high velocities. This pattern is common in crude oil production and offshore pipelines; however, it has not been studied as intensively as separated\nor intermittent flows. The dispersed oil-in-water flow pattern can be stable or unstable, which refers to the capability of the dispersed phase to coalesce.\nFigure 2.5 - Oil-in-water dispersed flow pattern.\nOil-in-water dispersed flow can flow under laminar or turbulent regimes. Turbulent dispersed oil-water flow has an interesting feature: the drag reduction phenomenon (DRP). The drag reduction phenomenon can be defined as a reduction in two-phase pressure gradient when compared to that of an equivalent single-phase flow, see section 2.1.\nAn experimental work on laminar and turbulent flow behaviors of oil-in-water emulsions was presented by Cengel et al. (1962). The comparison parameter was the viscosity. The authors concluded that the apparent viscosity does not depend on the Reynolds number and pipe diameter for laminar flow with low oil holdup. The apparent viscosity decreases when the Reynolds number increases, for oil fractions between 20% and 50%. Additionally, the apparent viscosity depends on the pipe inclination for oil fractions larger than 50%. The emulsions showed a drag reduction behavior in the turbulent region and this behavior was increased with the increase of the oil fraction.\nAngeli &amp; Hewitt (1998) carried out pressure-gradient measurements in horizontal oil-water flow in two different pipes (steel and acrylic). The pressure gradients measured in the acrylic tube were lower than those measured in the steel tube. The differences could be explained by the different wetting characteristics. The friction factors were lower than those expected for singlephase flow when oil was the continuous phase and about the same when water was the\ncontinuous phase. The authors mentioned that flow characteristics had not been understood completely and more studies would be needed. Under the same flow conditions, Angeli &amp; Hewitt (2000a) presented an experimental study on drop size and the interfacial area. The measurements were made using an endoscope. The endoscope was able to reach other regions in the pipe than that near the pipe wall. Two tubes of different materials (steel and acrylic) were used and it was possible to conclude that the pipe material affect the drop size.\nIn Lovick &amp; Angeli (2004a), drop size and distribution in horizontal dispersed flow were studied. Drop velocities and chord lengths were measured at different locations with a double sensor impedance probe. The experimental data were compared with existing models, and the agreement was poor. At similar experimental conditions, Lovick &amp; Angeli (2004b) measured pressure gradient, holdup and phase distribution in dual continuous flow. For all the experiments, the two-phase pressure gradient was lower than the measured in single-phase oil flow at the same mixture velocity. At the lowest mixture velocity, there was little variation of the pressure gradient with volume fraction. At the other velocities, the addition of water in single-phase oil resulted initially in a decrease in pressure gradient, even reaching values lower than those obtained with single-phase water flow. Another important parameter was the velocity ratio (defined as the ratio of the in-situ oil to water velocity, l^/ l^). The velocity ratio increased during dual continuous as the oil input fraction increased. At high input oil fractions, however, the velocity ratio decreased as the mixture velocity increased. The authors concluded that this behavior could be explained by the change of interface shape.\nIn Rodriguez &amp; Oliemans (2006), experimental results of pressure gradient, flow patterns and holdup are presented. The studied flow patterns were stratified and dispersed. The measurements were compared to the two-fluid model for stratified flow and the homogeneous model for dispersed flow. For the stratified flow patterns, the two-fluid model had the best agreement for water holdup and pressure gradient predictions. Otherwise, the homogeneous model was better for dispersed flow patterns. This behavior was similar in horizontal and vertical flows.\nZhao et al. (2006) performed experiments to determinate the local interfacial-area concentration, the local oil-phase fraction, interfacial velocity and oil-drop Sauter mean diameter of an oil-water upward vertical pipe flow. The measurements were made using a double-sensor conductivity probe. They related water flow rates with the local oil phase fraction, oil-drop Sauter 18\nmean diameter and the interfacial velocity. The local oil phase fraction and oil-drop Sauter mean diameter decreased with increasing the water flow rate (at constant oil flow rate) and the interfacial velocity increased. An interesting finding was that the measurements do not depend on the sampling frequency of the double-sensor conductivity probe when the sampling frequency is higher than 40 kHz.\nPal (2007) proposed that drag reduction in dispersions is caused by a significant reduction in effective viscosity of the dispersion when the flow regime changes from laminar to turbulent. This reduction occurs due to extensive stretching of droplets in the direction of flow. The degree of reduction is higher when the oil is the continuous phase. However, his model was not able to fit the experimental data at several flow conditions.\nA dual-plane electrical impedance tomographic technique was used to study oil-in-water vertical pipe flow (LI et al., 2008). The local volume fraction distributions and velocity profiles obtained via tomography was compared to that obtained by a local conductance probe. The electrical impedance tomography showed to be highly sensitive to the accuracy of the electrical measurements and the chosen image reconstruction algorithm. In general, there was a good agreement between electrical impedance tomography and conductance probe. The conductance probe offered a better description of the velocity profiles. It is necessary to improve the calibration and the reconstruction algorithm.\nIn Wang et al. (2011), it is presented an experimental study of pressure gradient and flow patterns in oil-water flow. It was observed that at low water fractions the flow was fully dispersed, while at intermediate ones water started to segregate as the mixture velocity increased. At high water fractions, water continuous layers formed and the pattern was either separated or annular with an oil continuous emulsion in the core. Pressure drop increased as the oil continuous emulsions occupied the whole pipe, but it decreased when water started to segregate and form a separated layer.\nPicchi et al. (2015) investigated a dilute and highly viscous oil-in-water dispersion. They measured holdup data using the QCV technique and a capacitance probe. It was measured pressure gradient too. The results were compared with a two-fluid model and homogenous model. The experimental data had a good agreement with the homogeneous model predictions for low holdup values. The two-fluid model had a better agreement for entire range of oil holdup. An\nimportant conclusion of this work is that the slip ratio was greater than unity, thus the oil was flowing faster in the pipe.\nA literature review on experimental studies in oil-in-water dispersed flow in pipes is summarized in Table 2.4. In the most of the works, low-viscosity oils were used. In this work, it is used a high-viscosity oil. Water-film studies were not found. The instrumentation is made of differential pressure transducers, quick closing valves and video cameras. In few cases, there were impedance sensors and gamma densitometers. Studies that relate the characteristics of the liquid film, as amplitude and frequency of interfacial waves, with the drag reduction phenomenon were not found.\nTable 2.4 - Summary of Experimental Studies on oil-water dispersed flow in pipes\nReference\tVso (m/s) and VsW (m/s)\tOil viscosity (cP)\tOrientation and diameter (mm)\tMeasurements\tMeters\nCengel et al.

When there is doubt about preponderant topology of the flow pattern, as in stratified flow with mixture at the interface or dual continuous flow, the two-fluid model can also be applied.\nThe homogeneous model assumes that: (1) the two phases can be treated as a pseudo single-phase fluid with suitable average properties that obeys the equations of single-phase flow; and (2) the slip ratio is 1. The pressure gradient is often given as:\n-Pm,homgsin#.\t(2.16)\nHere fmhmo is the mixture friction factor, pmhom is the mixture density, Vm is the mixture velocity and D the pipe\u2019s internal diameter.\nV = V +V (2 17) r m sw r so (2 .i/)\npm,hom = Pwhw,hom + (1 hw,hom)po,\t(2.18)\nwhere the water and oil holdups are, respectively:\nh hom\t.\t(2.19)\ny sw y so\ni'-.... = 1- hw,hom\t(2.20)\nAnd the friction coefficient can be determined by inserting the mixture Reynolds number into, for instance, the Blasius equation:\nfmhom = 0.312Re-m0'25\t(2.21)\nRem,hom =PmmVmD.\t(2.22)\nPm\nSingle-phase-flow friction factor correlations depend on an apparent or effective viscosity . There is not a general apparent viscosity correlation that allows the prediction of the apparent viscosity for different operational conditions and different liquid-liquid systems.

Behavior of interfacial waves, including film thickness, wavelength, frequency and shape, affects many flow characteristics, as flow pattern stability, pressure drop and heat transfer. A proper understanding of the interfacial waves is necessary for the development of suitable mechanistic models.\nMost of the studies on interfacial waves were devoted to gas-liquid flow. There are a few on liquid-liquid flow, but mostly with low viscosity fluids. Works on the interfacial wavy structure in viscous liquid-liquid flow are scanty and almost only on core-annular flow. Experimental studies on interfacial waves in gas-liquid and liquid-liquid flows are summarized in this section.\n2.5.1\tInterfacial Waves in Gas-Liquid Flow\nAnnular gas-liquid pipe flow is characterized by a gas core, a liquid film adjacent to the pipe wall and a wavy gas-liquid interface. However, a fraction of the liquid travels as droplets in the gas core due to a process known as liquid entrainment (GERACI et al., 2007). The interface\nbetween the liquid film and the gas core has a complex topology that is constantly changing in time and space. The interface can be characterized as having low-frequency disturbance waves, known as roll waves, along with high-frequency waves known as ripple waves. The latter are usually related to the liquid entrainment process. Figure 2.6 shows a diagram of an upward-vertical annular pipe flow where the two kinds of waves can be identified.\nFigure 2.6 - Diagram of upward-vertical annular pipe flow. (ARAI et al., 2015)\nRipple waves or ephemeral waves have small amplitudes, compared with the liquid film thickness, short life times, high frequency and usually do not occupy the whole tube circumference. Ripple waves dominate the interface when the liquid flow rate is low, such that the interface appears smooth. These waves exist for liquid-film Reynolds numbers below a critical value between 200 and 330. In addition, the gas velocity must be above a critical velocity. For air-water flow, the gas superficial velocity must be greater than 20 m/s. (LEVY, 1999; RODRIGUEZ, 2011).\nDisturbance waves, sometimes called \u201croll waves\u201d, have a longer life time and amplitudes usually several times the liquid film thickness (BELT et al., 2010). Several investigations on the disturbance-wave configuration have been performed (SEKOGUCHI &amp; TAKEISHI, 1989; ASALI &amp; HANRATTY, 1993; SCHUBRING &amp; SHEDD, 2008).\nDisturbance waves appear when the liquid flow rate is above a critical value and they have an important influence on the flow pattern due to their large size and dynamic properties. Table\n2.6\tpresents some studies on interfacial waves. Disturbance waves have been characterized by measuring film thickness and interfacial velocity. Few authors have given a quantitative\ndescription of the interfacial structures (ALEKSEENKO et al., 2009; BELT et al., 2010; SCHUBRING &amp; SHEDD, 2008).\nWaves play crucial roles in transport processes in annular flow such as mass transfer, momentum transfer and heat transfer between the phases. Furthermore, there is a relation between the disturbance waves and droplet entrainment (JACOWITZ &amp; BRODKEY, 1964; HAN &amp; GABRIEL, 2007). However, the exact mechanism of droplet detachment is still a topic of discussion (ALEKSEENKO et al., 2009; ALEKSEENKO et al., 2010).\nSome authors believe that ripple waves should be disregarded because disturbance waves govern the interface shape. For example, Sekoguichi et al. (1978) found that ripple waves are generated and absorbed by the roll waves. In Figure 2.7, one can see wavy interface in upward-vertical annular flow. The two types of waves, ripple and disturbance, can be seen. One can see ripple waves among disturbance waves, but due to poor space sensitivity it was not possible to study the details of the dynamics of the ripple waves. On the other hand, Alekseenko et al. (2014) and Cherdantsev et al. (2014) have shown that the mechanism of droplet formation and detachment may have to do with the interaction between ripple and roll waves.\nTable 2.6 - Summary of experimental studies on interfacial waves in gas-liquid flow in pipes\nReference\tStudied waves\tFluids - Diameter (mm)\tMeasurement technique\nNedderman &amp; Shearer (1963)\tDisturbance Waves (velocities, frequencies, wave number)\tAir-water 31.75\tHSC\nTaylor et al.

Taken from Belt et al. (2009)\n2.5.2\tInterfacial Waves in Liquid-Liquid Flow\nThere are relatively few studies about interfacial waves in liquid-liquid flow; some of them are summarized in Table 2.7. They are focused on stratified and core-annular flow. Most of these studies present visual observations using high-speed video cameras. It is clear that it is important to develop new methodologies for interfacial-wave measurements, particularly using instruments that would provide more information than that offered by video recording.\nOliemans et al. (1987) developed a study on interfacial waves in core-annular flow. Wavelengths were found to vary from 6 mm to 60 mm, while wave amplitudes were of the order of 1-2 mm. It was presented a correlation for wavelength depending on pipe radius, input water fraction and oil superficial velocity.\nA kinematic wave theory to describe interfacial waves in on core-annular flow was presented by Bannwart (1998). The theory offers information about the slip ratio and volumetric fraction of the core, but kinematic-wave information should be available a priori for the model to be applied. It was proposed a correlation between the wave speed and oil holdup. The theoretical holdup predictions were compared with horizontal and vertical experimental data. The theory showed good agreement with the experimental data.\nIn Rodriguez &amp; Bannwart (2006) experiments to measure wavelength, wave amplitude, wave profile, wave speed and holdup using a high speed video camera were carried out. It was\nproposed a method for indirect determination of holdup based on the kinematic wave theory and it was compared with the experimental data.\nIn Al-Wahaibi &amp; Angeli (2011) and Al-Wahaibi &amp; Angeli (2007) the interfacial wave characteristics were studied. The distribution of wave amplitudes and wavelengths were obtained at different oil and water velocities. The waves were recorded at two locations to study the development of the waves along the pipe. The authors remarked the dependence of the wave characteristics on the phase velocities, for instance the wave amplitudes increased as the superficial velocities increased. Another important conclusion was that the wave amplitudes, closer to the point of injection of fluids, were smaller than those farthest, while the wavelengths were relatively longer. Furthermore, it was established a relation between the wave characteristics and drop formation.\nWave amplitudes, wavelengths and wave speed were studied experimentally in stratified oil-water flow (CASTRO, PEREIRA, SANTOS, &amp; RODRIGUEZ, 2012). The wave characteristics were found to be dependent on holdup, inclination of the pipe and phases velocities. In addition, a methodology for the determination of the average interfacial wave shape was presented and a two-phase Froude number was proposed to correlate the data.\nInterfacial waves in stratified oil-water flows was studied with high speed imaging by Barral et al. (2015) . The waves appeared when the flow rates were different. The wave frequencies were found between 11 -20 Hz. The wave amplitude decreased while wavelength and wave velocity increased as waves move downstream.\nCastro &amp; Rodriguez (2015) developed a study about interfacial waves in stratified oil-water flow. Wave amplitude, wavelength and wave speed were measured using high-speed imaging. Correlations for wave aspect ratio, wave shape and wave speed were proposed. The proposed correlations showed good agreement with the experimental data. The correlation for wave shape was based on a second order Fourier equation.\nTable 2.7 - Summary of experimental studies on interfacial waves in liquid-liquid flow in pipes\nReference\tStudied features\tOil viscosity (cP) - Pipe diameter (mm) - Orientation - Flow pattern\tMeasurement technique\nOliemans et al.

Moreover, the existing literature covers mainly the application of these techniques in gasliquid flows. Specifically, some measurement techniques used for liquid-liquid flows are: conductive/capacitive probes, Electrical Capacitance/Resistance Tomography (ECT/ERT), conductive/capacitive Wire-Mesh Tomography (WMT), and single or multi-beam x/gamma-ray densitometry.\nConductive/capacitive probe emits a two-state signal indicating which phase surrounds the sensing part of the electrode, based on the detection of differences between the electrical properties of the two phases. From the fraction of the time that the probe resides in a given phase, the local volume fraction of that phase can be determined. In Zhao &amp; Lucas (2011) it was used an\nimpedance probe and a conductive probe to obtain the phase distribution of oil and water over the pipe's cross-section in bubbly oil-in-water pipe flows, Figure 2.8. Even though images of oilfraction distribution were generated, they only show time-averaged data.\nire outlet\nBrass bar\nProbe holder\nFigure 2.8 - Schematic diagram of the conductive probe used in Zhao &amp; Lucas (2011).\nWith ECT it is possible to determine the dielectric permittivity distribution in the interior of an object through external capacitance measurements. The ECT sensor consists of a total of M electrodes that are symmetrically mounted outside of a cylindrical container. During each scanning frame, an excitation signal in the form of an alternating voltage is applied to one of the M electrodes and the remaining electrodes are kept at the ground potential, acting as detector electrodes. The measured capacitances can then be represented in a matrix and used to reconstruct the tomographic image of the object. One disadvantage of ECT is that it produces low spatial resolution images. Zhao &amp; Lucas (2011) have used ERT to measure oil fraction distributions and Hasan &amp; Azzopardi (2007) have employed ECT to investigate stratifying kerosene-water flow, Figure 2.9.\nThe wire-mesh sensor is an intrusive imaging device that provides flow images at high spatial and temporal resolutions. The sensor is made of two sets of stainless steel wires stretched over the cross-section of a vessel or pipe with a small axial separation between them. Each plane of parallel wires is positioned perpendicular to each other, thus forming a grid of electrodes\n(Figure 2.10). The associated electronics measure the local conductivity or permittivity (capacitance) in the gaps of all crossing points at a high repetition rate. The spatial resolution of the images generated by the sensor corresponds to the wire separation within a single plane. It measures the local permittivity or conductivity in the gaps of all crossing points by successively applying an excitation voltage to each one of the sender electrodes at one wire plane, while measuring in parallel the current flowing toward the receiver electrodes at the other wire plane. In Rodriguez et al. (2012), a wire-mesh based in capacitance measurements is applied to investigate dispersed flow of oil and water in a horizontal glass pipe.\nFigure 2.9 - Schematic diagram of the ECT sensor used in Hasan &amp; Azzopardi (2007).\nSingle or multi-beam gamma-ray densitometry is a non-intrusive method that has also been applied for measuring local phase fractions in oil-water flow systems showing good spatial resolution, but relatively bad temporal resolution. Basically the gamma-ray attenuation technique makes use of the observation that a stationary homogeneous material will absorb a monochromatic beam of constant intensity and short wavelength radiation. The absorption occurs exponentially with increasing absorption length at constant linear absorption coefficient. In Kumara et al. (2010), a single gamma-ray densitometer was used to measure the cross-sectional distributions of oil and water phases in horizontal and slightly inclined oil-water flow.\nFigure 2.10 -Schematic diagram of the a WMS from Prasser (1998).\n2.6.1\tFilm Thickness Measurements in Gas-Liquid flows\nIn Clark (2002), twenty film thickness measurement techniques for gas-liquid flows are mentioned, divided into four groups. Film-average methods are for obtaining an average film thickness value measured over a considerable length of film. However, the application of these methods is possible only through the assumption that all the present liquid is in the form of a uniform symmetrical film. There has been little study using film average methods due predominantly to their inability to provide information on local interface phenomena, i.e., waves. Some methods in this group are the holdup measurement (BURNS, 2003) and the conductance method (KANG &amp; KIM, 1992). Localized methods include techniques that give local film thickness measurements (a few millimeters to a few centimeters averaged over a given area), but it is not possible to obtain from it an instantaneous point value. Two methods of this group are the capacitance probe (DEMORI et al., 2010) and ultrasonic pulse-echo methods (WADA et al., 2006). Point methods include all methods in which continuous or statistical information is obtained at a point in a liquid film where film thickness can be measured over small areas. These methods have not been as extensively used as localized methods because, generally, they are\nharder to implement and the results more difficult to analyze. Some examples are the needle contact probe (TAKESHIMA et al., 2002), the hot-wire method (FRANCO, 2007) and the fiberoptic techniques (ADDLESEE &amp; CORNWELL, 1997). Spatial Methods involve the performance of point or localized measurements simultaneously in different areas of the film in order to build up a global picture of the film thickness structure for the area under study. These techniques offer information of the three-dimensional wave structures. These methods include light absorption (MOUZA et al., 2000), multiple electrodes probes (BELT et al., 2010; DAMSOHN &amp; PRASSER, 2009A, 2009B; JIN, WANG, &amp; XU, 2003; KANG &amp; KIM, 1992), pigment luminance method (SCHAGEN et al., 2006), fluorescent imaging (ALEKSEENKO et al., 2010; SCHUBRING et al., 2010) and ultrasonic transmission (KAMEI &amp; SERIZAWA, 1998). Some methods were chosen as representatives and are presented next.\nThe first are optical techniques, such as photography, absorption, fluorescence and diffraction. These techniques require a transparent tube or windows, in some cases fluorescent elements applied to the liquid and preferably transparent phases. But these conditions are not always possible, especially in oil-water flow. (ALEKSEENKO et al., 2010; ALEKSEENKO et al., 2008; ALEKSEENKO et al., 2004; FARIAS et al., 2010; HAZUKU, TAKAMASA, &amp; MATSUMOTO, 2008; OLIVEIRA, YANAGIHARA, &amp; PAC\u00cdFICO, 2006; SAWANT et al., 2008; SCHAGEN et al., 2006; SCHUBRING et al., 2010; SCHUBRING, SHEDD, &amp; HURLBURT, 2010; SCHUBRING &amp; SHEDD, 2008)\nAlekseenko et al. (2008) studied spatial-temporal evolution of disturbance waves and ripple waves in annular gas-liquid flow using high-speed modification of laser-induced fluorescence. Experiments were performed in a vertical Plexiglas cylindrical channel with an inner diameter of 15 mm and a length of 1 m. Continuous green laser with wavelength 532 nm and power 50 mW was used as the light source. Rhodamin-6G was used as fluorescent matter. All experiments were conducted in a measurement area with a length of 20 cm with a spatial resolution 0.1 mm. The exposure time was 150 ps and the registration frame rate of 2000 fps. Registered image brightness was converted into local film thickness using a calibration curve obtained in a set of in situ calibration tests.\nSchubring et al. (2010) used planar laser-induced fluorescence to provide direct visualization of the liquid film in an upward vertical air-water annular flow. A small concentration of a fluorescent dye was introduced into the water, causing the liquid film to appear\nas bright regions on the images once exposed to laser light. Images were processed to locate the edge of the bright region, asserted to be the gas-liquid interface. For the experiments, a polypropylene tube was placed inside a black-walled box, with only two windows, one for the laser and one for the camera. Four hundred pictures were recorded in each experiment and thickness values were between 60 Lim and 300 Lim.\nMulti-conductance sensors (ALEKSEENKO ET AL., 2009; BELT ET AL., 2010; DAMSOHN &amp; PRASSER, 2009a, 2009b; SAWANT et al., 2008) have been widely applied for many years in the study of air-water annular pipe flows. The main disadvantage of conductance sensor is that it cannot measure the film thickness of a non-conductive phase, as it is the case in oil-water dispersed flow. Damsohn &amp; Prasser (2009) built two conductance sensors with different properties, each consisting of an array of 64 x 16 points of measurement and a time resolution of 10000 fps. The first sensor can measure up to 800 Lim films. The electrodes are spaced 1560^m, which leads to a spatial resolution of 3120 Lim. The second sensor can measure films between 100 Lim and 700 Lim with spatial resolution of 2 x 2 mm . They were made with a standard printed-circuit board (PCB). The geometry of the sensor was optimized in terms of the sensor characteristic by potential-field simulations. The first sensor measures thin films, like disturbance waves with films less than 100 Lim and the second resolves smaller structures, but has low sensitivity for thin films. The authors suggest the combination of the two sensors to take advantage of each one and to build the sensor on a flexible PCB in order to be adapted into a cylindrical tube (experiments were done in cubic structures).\nThe wire-mesh sensor combines intrusive local measurement of phase fraction and tomographic cross-sectional imaging. The wire-mesh sensor based on measurements of electrical permittivity (capacitance) allows studying flows involving non-conducting fluids, such as oil-air flow. The advantages of this technique are: low cost, simplicity when compared with other tomography systems, and high spatial and temporal resolution. In Lopez et al. (2012), a wiremesh based on capacitance measurements to investigate falling liquid film in gas-liquid flows was presented. In that work, the local gas void fraction distribution was assumed to have a linear relationship with the measured permittivity and, by using a geometrical ratio the liquid film thickness was found. In addition, the liquid film velocity, the liquid entrainment fraction and image of the section were obtained. The most important disadvantage of this method is the intrusiveness.\n2.6.2\tFilm Thickness Measurements in Liquid-Liquid Flow\nOnly a few measurement techniques for liquid-liquid flows have been proposed. Table 2.8 has a comparison between those methods. Depending on the specific application is appropriate to use one or the other. For example, a high temporal resolution is desirable in the case of oil-in-water dispersed flow where the water velocity is high (greater than 5000 fps) and a high spatial resolution (the highest possible) is necessary for detecting small waves (ripple waves) in annular flow.\nIn Oliemans et al. (1987), a photographic method was used to study water film thickness in core-annular flows. Wavelengths were seen to vary from 6 to 60 mm, while wave amplitudes were of the order of 1 to 2 mm. Authors mentioned the problem of optical distortion due to diffraction. A disadvantage of this method is that the measurements are only taken in a given area, i.e. in front of the camera (top and bottom for horizontal pipe, right and left for vertical pipe).\nConductance/Capacitive sensors have been widely applied for many years in the area of flows in pipes. Normally, they are simpler, have fast response, are non-intrusive and non-invasive, and have flexibility in electrode design. If the electrodes are flush to the wall, these methods are non-intrusive, but limited to low viscosity fluids. Conductance/Capacitive planar sensors have been used to investigate film thickness of conductive or nonconductive liquids, respectively. They make use of the relationship between electrical capacity and film thickness. Only a few flow applications of planar sensors on multiphase measurements have been reported in the past (BONILLA et al., 2014; THIELE et al., 2009). During the development of this work, a conductance planar sensor with 64 x 16 measuring points was used for water film thickness measurements in oil-water flows (BONILLA et al., 2014). The measured water film thickness had between 100 pm and 700 pm. The sensor could not measure the water film when oil had touched the surface of the sensor before the measurements, because oil stuck to the sensor produced an isolation effect. To avoid this limitation, it was proposed to use capacitive measurements instead of conductive. Thiele et al. (2009), presented a capacitive planar sensor to visualize flows of multiphase mixtures along the surface of objects. The sensor comprises a matrix of 1024 interdigital sensing structures which are individually interrogated based on capacitance wire-mesh sensor electronics (SILVA, SCHLEICHER, &amp; HAMPEL, 2007). The\nmaximal liquid thickness, which influences the measurements at a sensor, is 750 pm. No application of this method in pipelines was found.\nIn summary, there are a few film thickness measuring techniques for oil-water flow in the literature. These techniques have been used in studies of annular flow (gas-liquid and liquidliquid flows). No applications in dispersed flows were encountered.\nTable 2.8 - Comparison of Liquid-Liquid Measurement Techniques\nTechnique\tSpatial resolution (mm)\tTemporal resolution (frames/s)\tMin - Max film thickness (pm)\tApplication\nPhotographic (OLIEMANS et al., 1987)\t-\t2000 - 10000\t1000-2000\tCore-Annular flow\nCapacitive Planar Sensor (THIELE et al., 2009)\t2x1\t15000\tUp to 750\tIsopropyl alcohol -benzene mixture\nConductive Planar Sensor (BONILLA et al., 2014)\t2x2\t10000\t100-700\tOil-water mixture\nCapacitive Planar Sensor (In this work)\t4x4\t5000\t400-2200\tOil-water flow\n2.7\tPlanar Sensor\nA planar sensor is a sensor where the electrodes are placed in a co-planar plane. Two important advantages of these kinds of sensors are: only a single-side access to the test material is required and the strength of the output signal can be controlled by changing the area of the sensor, the number of electrodes or the spacing between them. There are several applications of the planar sensor in proximity/displacement measurement (CHEN &amp; LUO, 1998), nondestructive testing (SHARMA, 2011), material characterization (MAMISHEV et al., 2004), humidity measurement (STEELE et al., 2008), flow studies (BELT et al., 2010) and health monitoring (NASSR &amp; EL-DAKHAKHNI, 2011).\nThe operating principle of planar sensors is based on the interaction between a test substance or material and the interrogating electric field. The disturbance in the electric field can be detected by a receiver and is related to the properties of the conductive or dielectric material or substance near the sensor (HU &amp; YANG, 2010).\nA planar sensor is normally an array of electrode pairs, named transmitter and receiver, flush mounted on an insulating surface. An electrical stimulus is applied to a transmitter electrode while a measurement is taken from a receiver electrode. According to the frequency of the\nelectrical stimulus, the measurements can be related with the permittivity or/and the conductivity of the test material. Figure 2.11 shows a planar sensor and the electric field lines between the electrodes (in green).\nFigure 2.11 - The electric field lines between the electrodes in a planar sensor.\nThe interaction between the test material and electric field (E) can be described by (SILVA, 2008)\nJ = crE + jaD (2.23)\nwhere J is the current density, a is the conductivity, o> = 2 n f (f is the frequency), j = V\u20141 and D is the electric displacement. This equation is valid assuming that there is not externally generated current density and the magnetic field effects are negligible. The relation between the electric displacement and the electric field is expressed as\nD ,\t(2.24)\nwhere\tis the vacuum permittivity, permittivity of free space or electric\nconstant and is the relative permittivity.\nThe electric field, D, is related to the electric potential,&lt;/>, by (SERWAY &amp; JEWTT, 2014)\nE = -V</>,\t(2.25)\nand the continuity equation is\nv. J =\t(2.26)\ndt\nwhere p is the electric charge density.\nCombining eq. (2.23) to (2.26) and assuming free charge density, one can obtain\nV-[-(a + ja\u00a30\u00a3r )V^] = 0.\t(2.27)\nFor electrostatic approximation and assuming no free charge in the sensing space, the eq. can be written as\nV(\u00a30sr V0) _ 0.\t(2.28)\nThe capacitance\tin Farads of a capacitor is the ratio of the magnitude of the charge on\none of the plates to the potential difference between them (U).\nC _ Q\nU (2.29)\nBy Gauss\u2019s law, the electric net flux through any closed surface is\nE \u2022 dA _ Q\nS0\t(2.30)\nFor a capacitor filled by a dielectric with relative permittivity \u00a3r, the capacitance C is\n^r^0 E \u2022 dA\nC _ J E \u2022 dl\t(2.31)\nThe analytic solution of eq. (2.27) is only possible for some simple cases and limited cases, then it is necessary an approach method. There are many options to obtain an approximate response, for example, finite elements method (FEM), finite difference method, boundary element method (BEM), etc. A solution of this equation produced the three-dimensional field line plot. A sketch of the field lines, in a plane, can be seen in Figure 2.11.\n2.7.1\tCircuits\nThe permittivity and the conductivity of a sample cannot be measured directly. But, its impedance is measurable and the conductivity and the relative permittivity can be determined from this.\nImpedance ( ) is generally defined as the total opposition a device or circuit offers to the flow of an alternating current (AC), and is represented as a complex quantity,\nZ _ R + jX (2.32) where there is a real part (resistance, R) and an imaginary part (reactance, X) (AGILENT, 2003).\nSometimes it is more convenient to use the inverse of Z, the admittance\nY _ \u2014 _ G + jB\nZ\t(2.33)\nwhere is the conductance and is the susceptance.\nFor a simple geometry, as parallel plate capacitor, the capacitance and conductance can be defined as\n(2.34)\nwhere is a constant related to the geometry, is the relative static permittivity (sometimes called the dielectric constant) of the test material, is the electric constant (\n) and is the conductivity.\nThere are several impedance measurement methods. Traditional methods include: bridge, resonant, Current-Voltage (I-V), network analysis and auto-balancing bridge (AGILENT, 2003). The measurements using wire-mesh sensors are made with auto-balancing bridges. This circuit allows remaining all receiver electrodes very close to ground potential. This is an important feature to suppress cross-talk to far located receiver electrodes, as discussed in Prasser et al. (1998).\nFigure 2.12 presents a basic schematic circuit of the auto-balancing bridge, where Uin is the excitation voltage, represents the unknown impedance and the feedback network. Assuming that the op-amp is ideal the output voltage is determined by\nout\nZ\n(2.35)\nFigure 2.12 - Basic circuit configuration of the auto-balancing bridge impedance measuring method.\nThe proper dimensioning of the and is important for the correct operation of the autobalancing bridge. Additionally, the operation frequency and the characteristics of the op-amp used must be taken into account. According to the frequency, the circuit may then be dimensioned as capacitance or resistance dominant (SILVA, 2008). As a result, and from a material under test can be measured.\nGiven that,\nRf = 1/ Gf\t(2.36)\nR=1/ Gx\t(2.37)\nthe gain of the circuit can be written as\nU\u2018 OUt Uin \"\tG + j2nfC - -\t- (2.38) Gf + j(\t)\nAnd the magnitude of eq. (2.38) is\nUUout\t= i\tG+(2xf )2 c2\nUm\t\tG+(2nf )2 cf\nThe frequency response of a practical auto-balancing bridge has two frequency bands with a constant gain, with values of\tand , correspondingly, see Figure 2.13 . An auto-\nbalancing bridge was used to measure conductance using a resistance in the feedback network in Damsohn &amp; Prasser (2009) and capacitance using a pair resistance-capacitor in the feedback network in Thiele et al. (2009).\nFigure 2.13 - Frequency response of a practical auto-balancing bridge (SILVA, 2008).\n2.7.2\tConductance System\nThe conductance sensor system, designed in Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETHZ) (DAMSOHN &amp; PRASSER, 2009), has 64 x 16 measuring points and measuring area of 128 mm x 32 mm and a time resolution of 10000 fps. The system can measure films between 100 pm and 700 pm with spatial resolution of 2 mm x 2 mm. Figure 2.14 shows the conductance system. In the planar sensor, the transmitting electrodes are connected in one direction (transmitter lines), while the receiver electrodes are coupled perpendicular to this direction (receiver lines).\nA voltage pulse is supplied to the first electrode of each pair and current flows to the second electrode, which is put to zero potential. The current depends on the thickness of the electrically conducting liquid film covering both electrodes. Through a process of switching, each transmitter electrode is activated sequentially, i.e., it sends an electrical signal to the fluid. Then, the receiver electrode gets a signal that contains the information that identifies the type of fluid at each active area. When the sequence of switching for the entire set of transmitters is complete, one frame with the information of the fluid or phase over the sensor surface is available, within a time interval (PRASSER et al. 1998).\nThe circuit in Figure 2.14 uses a low impedance transmitter driver for each transmitter and a transimpedance amplifier for each receiver. The crossing points of the active transmitter and the transimpedance amplifiers constitute several auto-balancing bridges. The transmitter driver and the transimpedance amplifier guarantee that the potential at all non-activated transmitter electrodes and all receiver electrodes remains very close to ground potential, which prevents crosstalk between transmitters located far away (not actives) and the receiver electrodes. Therefore, parasitic currents traveling from not activated transmitters to receivers as well as from a receiver electrode to a neighboring one are not induced and their effect are minimized.\nFigure 2.14 - Circuit of the conductance system, adapted from Prasser et al. (1998) and Damsohn\n&amp; Prasser (2009).\n2.7.2.1\tCalibration and Compensation\nSince the relationship between measured current and film thickness is non-linear because the potential field has a higher concentration in the region near to the wall and decreases with the distance, a calibration procedure is necessary. Also, the calibration is able to counteract variances in the measured values of a transmitter-receptor pair due to differences in the electrical characteristics of the individual components, for instance resistor tolerances, op-amp gains, among others.\nDamsohn (2011) proposed a procedure where the sensor is immersed into water with an inclined angle and various cylinders made of nonconductive material with a known gap (they have gaps between 0 pm and 1000 pm) are rolled over the sensor. The calibration value is taken from the minimum measured value, when the cylinder is passing over the measuring point. The calibration values for each measurement point are fitted with a fourth order rational polynomial.\nFinally, eq. (2.40) is used to relate the conductance with the film thickness 5 in each measurement point,\n8 = aG4 + aG3 + a,G2 + a.G + a,\t. A,\n1 m 2 m 3 m 4 m 5\u201c (2 40)\nwhere a x to a5 are the polynomial coefficients determined by the calibration curve fitting.\nIn Damsohn (2011) was proposed a simple and robust solution for temperature compensation where the sensor is replaced with known reference resistors. The resistors are arranged such that each receiver line is connected to three resistors of different resistances. The voltage in the reference resistors is measured in two moments: (1) immediately after the calibration process, U re^ c az, and (2) after each experiment in the pipeline, U re^ meas. Then, the ratio p between those values is the compensation factor, eq (2.41).\n<P =\nU ref ,cal\nU f\nref ,meas\n(2.41)\nThe measure value of Gm with the conductance circuit and using the compensation of\nDamsohn (2011) can be calculated as\nGm\n(2.42)\n\nwhere Um is the measured value and Us at is the saturation value corresponding to the value\nobtained when the measuring point is not covered with the cylinder, but only by water.\n2.7.3\tCapacitance System\nIn Silva (2008), the sensor system has 32 x 32 measuring points, a measuring area of 620 mm x 500 mm, and a time resolution of 2500 fps. The sensor can measure films up to 690 Lim with spatial resolution of 7.8 mm x 6.6 mm. This sensor is arranged in a matrix, with transmitters connected in one direction and receptors connected perpendicularly to the transmitters.\nThe transmitter electrodes are successively excited by an AC signal, while all the other transmitter electrodes are connected to ground potential, Figure 2.16. The electrical currents flowing from the activated electrode to the receptor electrode is converted to voltage by an autobalancing bridge, Figure 2.15. This routine is repeated for all transmitter electrodes being activated.\nFigure 2.15 - Circuit of the capacitance system, adapted from Thiele et al. (2009).\nFigure 2.16 - Excitation scheme of the comb sensor, adapted from Silva et al. (2007).\nThiele et al. (2009) presented the process to calculate the fluids permittivity using the circuit in Figure 2.15. The procedure starts by covering the entire sensor with a low permittivity substance, el, oil for example, el = 3.5 , and measuring. The procedure is repeated with another substance with high permittivity, , for example water (\t). Then, two factors ( and )\nare calculated for each measuring area as follow,\na(i .) = U (i> J) ~ Ul (i> J)\n\u2019\tln(HH) - ln(HL)\nUL (i, j)ln(gH) - Uh (i, J Mh)\t(' 3\n\u2019\tln(HH ) - ln(HL)\nSm (i,J) = eXP\n(2.44)\nUL and UH are the measured voltages with the low permittivity substance and the high permittivity, respectively, and the indices i and j represent the position in the sensor matrix, i.e. the index of the pair transmitter-receiver. The measured permittivity, sm, is calculated as\nUm (i,j) ~ \u00a3(i,j) tf(i,j)\nThese works showed the permittivity distribution for a two-fluids mixture, where each fluid had a different permittivity.\nThiele et al. (2009) proposed a calibration procedure using a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plate. The plate was placed covering the entire sensor. One of its endpoints was raised by a thin plastic spacer of 1.5 mm thickness, while the other one was in direct contact with the sensor, creating an inclined plane. This assembly was immersed in ethyl alcohol, which resulted in a liquid film of continuously increasing thickness over the sensor surface.\n2.7.4\tGeometries\nDifferent geometries of planar sensors have been proposed in the literature, depending mainly on the application and test characteristics. They are not suitable geometries for all the cases. It is necessary to do a particular study for each case, taking into account the required characteristics and purpose, before to select the best geometry for a specific application. Figure 2.17 presents some photos and diagrams of planar sensors used to measure two phase mixtures. In the figure R refers to receptor electrode, T to transmitter electrode and G to ground electrode. The features of these sensors are summarized in Table 2.9.\nTable 2.9 - Planar sensor features.\nReference\tSpatial resolution (mm) and number of measurement points\tTemporal resolution (frames/s)\tMin - Max film thickness (pm)\tApplication\nDamsohn &amp; Prasser (2009)\t3.2x3.2 and 1024 points\t10000\t100-600\tAir-water annular flow\nThiele et al.

A schematic view of the facilities is shown in Figure 3.1 and Table 3.1 lists the main instruments and equipment.\nFigure 3.1 - Schematic of the experimental multiphase flow facility at LETeF.\nThe test pipe consists of a 12-meters-height glass section of 50.8 mm i.d. Water and oil are used as test fluids. Both water and oil are kept in polyethylene reservoirs tanks, (RW) and (RO), respectively. Each phase is pumped, from its respective storage tank, to the test section, by positive displacement pumps (BW and BO, respectively), both remotely controlled by variable\nfrequency drivers. Oil and water are mixed at the beginning of the glass pipe via a Y-junction (MGL) as shown in Figure 3.1.\nPositive displacement and vortex flow meters are used to measure high and low oil flow rates (FO1 and FO2, respectively) and high and low water flow rates (FW1 and FW2, respectively), see Table 3.2. After the test line, the mixture goes to a coalescent-plate separator tank (SLL). The phases, once separated, are returned to their respective storage tanks by gravity (RW and RO). A computer and LabVIEW\u2122 is used to conduct the tests and collect the data.\nTable 3.1 - Main Instruments and Equipment of the Facility.\nSymbol\tDescription\tSymbol\tDescription\nA\tW VFP - Water Variable-frequency driver O VFP - Oil Variable-frequency driver\to\tFO1, FO2- Oil Flow Meters FW1, FW2 - Water Flow Meters\ni>*<i\tQCV1, QCV2, QCV3 - Quick Closing Valve\tX\tControl Valve\n\tDifferential Pressure Transducer\tG\tBW - Water Pump BO - Oil Pump\nSLL\tCoalescent-plates liquid-liquid separator\tRW\tWater Tank\nMGL\tMultiphase mixer\tSGL\tGas-liquid separator Tank\nRO\tOil Tank\t\t\nIn-situ phase volume fractions (holdup) are measured using the quick-closing-valves technique (QCVs). Solenoid valves V1 and V2 are normally open. The open-close time is of 0.11 s. In steady-state flow regime, the solenoid valves number V1 and V2 are open, allowing the fluid to pass through the test line. During the tests, by energizing V1, V2 and the valves in the test section, the mixture is trapped in the test line and the two-phase flow deviated to the by-pass line. After the drainage of the test line, it is possible to measure the value of the volumetric fraction of each phase. The flow patterns can be identified via visualization technique.\nA high-speed video camera (Olympus i-Speed 3) records a projected lateral view of the flow at up to 40.000 fps.\n3.1\tFlow-loop F acilities\n3.1.1\tWater and Oil Pumps (BW and BO)\nTwo 10-hp positive displacement pumps, Weatherford model 2WHT 53/F, are used in the flow loop to pump oil and water. Each pump is controlled by a variable-frequency drive of 12 KW (W VFP and O VFP).\n3.1.2\tAir Compressor\nA 30-hp screw compressor Schulz SRP 3030 is responsible for the air supply to the flow loop. It has an effective flow rate of 3511 L/min and outlet working pressure of 7.5 bar. The compressed air coming out of compressor is cooled by a heat exchanger, followed by a three-way branch containing pneumatic control valves in each one.\n3.1.3\tFlow Meters\nTable 3.2 shows some specification of the available flow meters.\nTable 3.2 - Characteristics of the flow meters in the flow loop.\nMeter\tFluid\tFlow\tUncertainty (% of measured value)\tSuperficial velocity 2\u201d pipe (m/s)\nOGT Oval (FW1)\tWater\t1.0 - 35 L/min\t\u00b10.75\t0.00848 - 0.297\nEX-DELTA VXW1050 Oval (FW2)\tWater\t33.33-1300 L/min\t\u00b11.0\t0.28 - 11.03\nLSF45 Oval M-III (FO1)\tOil\t0.05-8.0 L/min\t\u00b11.0\t0.000424 - 0.0679\nFLOWPET-EG LS5376 Oval (FO2)\tOil\t2.5 - 106. 7 L/min\t\u00b11.0\t0.0212 - 0.905\n3.1.4\tOil-Water Separator\nA coalescing-plate separator (SLL) with a capacity of 220 L is used for the separation process of the mixture of oil and water that comes from the test section. Both tap water and oil are kept in the same large coalescent-plate separator. Because of the difference in density, oil lies in the upper part of the separator, while water remains in the lower part. Once separated, oil and water are driven by gravity to their own tanks. Each phase is separately pumped through its own\nseries of pipes and flow and temperature meters from the respective tanks to the mixing section. After the outlet of the test section, pipes carry the mixture to a gas separator tank. The mixture reaches the top of the separator tank and escapes through a chimney, while the liquids get back to the coalescing-plate separator.\n3.1.5\tOther Meters\nThere were thermocouples in the oil line (type k) to measure temperature. It was considered that the water would have similar temperature than the oil. There is a pressure gauge, in the oil line, for pressure control and safety reasons, to prevent accidents.\n3.1.6\tQuick-Closing-Valves\nThree ball solenoid valves let the flow goes through the pipeline or the bypass. The flow in the principal pipeline is controlled by two normally open valves and a normally closed valve is used to control entry of the fluids into the bypass line. Each valve is activated by its own pneumatic actuator. The supply pressure is 4 bar and the torque is 6 N-m. The open/close time is 0.11 s.\n3.2\tData Acquisition System\nA computer with a data acquisition card NI PCI-6224 and LabVIEW controls the system. This system receives and sends signals to different gauges and equipment, both for operating and analysis purposes. The NI PCI-6224 had an ADC with 16 bits of resolution, 48 digital channels and 32 analog channels.\nThe digital channels were used for the activation of the quick-closing valves and analog inputs were used to connect all the meters. The actuators that control water, air and oil flows were triggered via low frequency CAN system.\n3.3\tFluids and Test Matrix\nThe fluids used in the experiments consisted of a refined mineral oil and tap water. Oil and water physical properties are listed in Table 3.3. The electrical characteristics of the fluids were\nmeasured with an impedance analyzer Solartron 1260 at frequency of 5 MHz with an accuracy of\n0.1%. Oil-water Interfacial tension was of 0.033 N/m.\nTable 3.3 - Characteristics of the fluids.\nFluid\tViscosity (cP at 25\u00b0)\tDensity (kg/m3)\tRelative Permittivity (-)\tConductivity (S/m)\nWater\t1\t988\t79\t4.12x10-3\nOil\t220\t860\t3.5\t0.04x10-15\nDue to facility limitations, the experimental regions were restricted to the areas plotted in red on the flow pattern map of Bannwart et al. (2011), Figure 3.2. As mentioned before, the interest of this work is to study dispersed oil-in-water and annular flows. The water superficial velocity was changed between 0.1 m/s and 0.3 m/s for annular flow and between 0.7 m/s and 1.96 m/s for dispersed oil-in-water flow. The oil superficial velocity was varied between 0.3 m/s and 0.8 m/s for both cases. The experimental points were chosen such that the water film thickness could be measured with the capacitive system, i.e. when the film thickness was lower than 2200 pm. In preliminary experiments, the water film thickness for the stable annular flow (0.05 m/s &lt;Vso &lt;0.3 m/s) was observed higher than 3000 pm and higher than 2500 pm for dispersed oil-in-\nwater flow when the oil superficial velocity is lower than 0.06 m/s.\nVso [m/s]\n0.05\t0.10\n0.50\t1.00\nC/3\n\u00a3\nc/>\n>\n2.00\n1.50\n1.00\n0.70\n0.50\n0.30\n0.20\n0.15\n0.10\nOil Droplets\n\u2022isperswi water in oil\n_ Dispersed oil in water\n/ Unstable Annular, \u25a0\nIntermittent\t'\n//Stable Annular /\t/\t/\nJ I/. \u25a0 \u25a0 i\u25a0 Vz .

In this research Comsol Multiphysics and Matlab were used to simulate.\nElectrostatic simulations were carried out to compare sensor geometries found in the capacitive sensing literature and determine the best geometry for measuring water film thickness in oil-water flows. The best geometry was simulated in frequency conditions (at 5 MHZ) using electric current simulations.\nThe geometry in both simulations was similar. Each simulated sensor had two transmitter electrodes, two receptors and ground electrodes around them. The boundary of the simulation space is set to be a square infinite element (dimensions 13 mm x13 mm x 13 mm). The structure was composed by the sensor, aluminum (to simulate the section where the sensor was placed), water, and oil, represented for rectangular shapes, Figure 3.3.\nThe sensor had two parts: the electrodes and the insulating surface (PCB). The structure of the sensors was on the order of microns. The electrodes height was 50 pm, and PBC size was 8 mm x8 mm x 0.45 mm.\nThe width of water, oil and air changed in each simulation. The width of the water layer over the sensor is the studied film thickness. The characteristics of the used material are in Table 3.4.\nTable 3.4 - Characteristics of the materials.\nMaterial\tDomains\tRelative Permittivity (-)\tConductivity (S/m)\nAir\tArround the structure\t1\t0\nCooper\tElectrodes\t1\t5.998x107\nPolyimide\tPCB\t3.3\t7x10-16\nAluminum\tUnder PCB\t1.8\t35x106\nWater\tOver the electrodes and PCB\t79\t4.12x10-3\nOil\tOver the water\t3.5\t0.04x10-15\nFigure 3.3 - Example of structure geometry.\nThe conditions used for the simulation were: one transmitter electrode was set to 1 Volt and the other transmitter and the receivers were set to 0 Volt. One can see in Figure 3.4 the electric field lines when a transmitter is active.\n3.4.1\tGeometries Testing\nThe procedure consisted on implementing the geometries with the minimum values (for the PCB parameters) and changing the spacing between the electrodes, trying to keep the spatial resolution in the minimum possible. The geometries were simulated for various water films. The capacitance was found for those film thicknesses.\nIn that study, the technological limits of the PCB-production were considered as boundary conditions. Those boundary parameters were: the trace width, the annular ring, the via size and the minimum spacing. Also, they were designed to avoid having right or acute angles, &lt;90\u00b0, (GUTIERREZ &amp; COATES, 2010).\n3.4.2\tSelected Geometry\nThe selected geometry was simulated taking into account the electric currents and the electrostatic field. It was used a frequency of 5 MHz, that it is the operation frequency of the capacitance measurement system. In this case, the water height was varied between 100 pm and 3500 pm in steps of 100 pm.\nFigure 3.4 - Example of streamlines in a simulation\nMEASUREMENT SYSTEM\nThe proposed liquid-film thickness measurement system is presented in Figure 4.1 and Figure 4.2. The system consists of eight parts. The waveform generator, the analog-digital converter (ADC) and the FPGA (1, 5 and 6 in the Figure 4.1 and Figure 4.2) are integrated through a National Instrument PXI-1072 equipment. The transmitter and reception circuits were built during this work (2 and 4 in the figures), they are based on the circuits used in the capacitance Wire-Mesh sensor (SILVA, 2008). The planar sensor was provided by Professor\nHorst-Michael Prasser from ETH Zurich. The circuits and FPGA programs were made with the\nhelp of Dr. Hugo Fernando Velasco.\n7. Computer\n8. High Speed Camera\nPXI 1072\nFigure 4.1 - Schematic arquitecture of the proposed liquid-film thickness measurement system.\nFigure 4.2 presents the information flow in the system. The FPGA controls the system by producing signals to activate each transmitter and the high speed camera, synchronously. The 55\nanalog multiplexer leads the signal to the transmitter electrodes (Tx) in the planar sensor. The amplifiers give a signal proportional to the capacitance of the fluids over each pair transmitterreceiver (Tx-Rx). The ADCs convert the measured signal in a digital signal and the signals are storage in the computer.\nFigure 4.2 - Schematic diagram of the information flow for the proposed liquid-film thickness measurement system.\nThe main characteristics of the system are listed in Table 4.1. The system can be characterized by: (i) the spatial resolution of 4 x 4 mm2 (one pixel in the resulting frame represents a square area with that size), (ii) the depth resolution of 6.2 qm calculated by measuring the maximum and minimum voltages and taking in account the ADC resolution, see calculation in APPENDIX B (it is possible to differentiate changes in the film height of 6.2 qm) and (iii) the temporal resolution of 200 qs (one frame time) which depends on the time to reach a steady state at the signal in a transmitter, see calculation in APPENDIX B. Consequently, the waves or structures near to the pipe wall could have a maximum velocity of Vmax = 3 m/s to allow detection of their variations. The measurement range of the sensor is from 400 qm to 2200 qm from the pipe wall.\nchannels. In the figure, the Tx2 is active; the dashed line over the sensor represents the sensing area of the pair Tx2-Rx2. The spatial resolution is the region of measuring of a pair Tx-Rx (the blue region in the Figure 4.3), which corresponds to the spatial separation between electrodes. The electrodes are the only conductive portion of the sensor in contact with the fluids.\nTable 4.1 - Characteristics of the measurement system.\nSystem Characteristic\tValue\nSpatial resolution\t4 x 4 mm2\nDepth resolution\t6.2 pm\nTemporal resolution\t5000 frames/s\nWork frequency\t5 MHz (ajustable)\nMeasurement range\t400 pm to 2200 pm\nMeasuring points\t208 (13 Tx and 16 Rx)\nMeasuring area\t52 mm x 64 mm\nRxl\tRx2\tRx3\n\u2022\tQ\t\u2022\nTransmitter electrode\n\u2014> Receiver electrode\nTx2\nTx3\n\u20140------0 Txl3\n4\nFigure 4.3 - Schematic view of the circuit used in the proposed liquid-film thickness system.\n4\t\u2022\n4.1\tWaveform Generator\nThe first part is the signal generator, which is responsible for generating a sinusoidal signal; this was made using the 100 MS/s sampling rate, 14-bit resolution arbitrary waveform generator, NI PXI-5412.The generator is able to produce sinusoidal signals up to 20 MHz and 12 Volts peak. A computer, using software developed in LabVIEW\u2122, programs the frequency, amplitude and waveform. In this work, the sinusoidal signal had 5V peak and frequency of 5 MHz. At this frequency, the gain of the auto-balancing bridges only depends on the feedback capacitor and the fluids capacitance (SILVA, 2008); refer to Figure 2.13 for the fluids used in this work.\n4.2\tTransmission Circuit\nThe generated signal is applied to the transmitters (in the sensor) through an analog\nmultiplexer (ISL84051IBZ). In order to guarantee that the signals have low impedance, buffers (LMH6559MA) are used at the output of the multiplexer. When a transmitter is active, the others are grounded; this scheme was explained in section 2.7. Figure 4.4 shows the homemade\ntransmission-circuit board built in this work.\nFigure 4.4 - Homemade transmission circuit board.\n4.3\tPlanar Sensor\nThe heart of the system is the planar sensor (Figure 4.5 and Figure 4.6). The sensor has\nthree types of electrodes: transmitters, receivers and ground. The sensor is arranged in a two-58\ndimensional array, where the transmitters are connected in one direction (transmitter lines), while the receivers are placed perpendicular to this direction (receiver lines). It was manufactured using multilayer PCB fabrication technology and flexible material; some of the sensor characteristics are summarized in Table 4.2.\nTable 4.2 - Characteristics of the planar sensor.\nFeature\tValue\nPCB material\tPolyimide\nConductive material\tCooper\nCoating material\tGold (to prevent corrosion)\nCoating layer size\t5 pm\nNumber of layers\t9\nLaser-drilled holes diameter\t0.25 mm\nPath sizes\t0.1 mm\nSpace between insulating and electrodes\t20 pm\nMean sensing area thickness\t0.40 mm\nThe sensor used in this investigation was developed in LKE Lab in ETH Zurich. It was lent to the USP via an inter-institutional cooperation. The sensor has a sensing area of length of 192 mm and width of 52 mm. It consists of 5221 big electrodes (diameter 0.9 mm) and 5220 small electrodes (diameter 0.5 mm). In total there are 48 transmitter lines and 176 receiver lines. The sensor is detailed in Tiwari et al. (2014). Three different combinations of receiver and transmitter electrodes are nested into one another. The different arrangements possible of sensors in the planar sensor (matrix) are summarized in Table 4.3. Each matrix corresponds to a set of pair Tx-Rx with the same spatial resolution.\nTable 4.3 - Characteristics of each matrix of the planar sensor.\nMatrix\tNumber of Tx\tNumber of Rx\tSpatial Resolution\tMeasurement range\nNear field\t26\t96\t2 x 2 mm2\t100 pm to 700 pm*\nMiddle field\t13\t48\t4 x 4 mm2\t400 pm to 2200 pm*\nFar field\t9\t32\t12 x 12 mm2\t1000 pm to 3500 pm\n* Measured values using the proposed capacitance system.\n2 \u2022\nThe matrix with spatial resolution of 4 x 4 mm (middle field, in Table 4.3) was selected according to the expected film-thickness in this work and preliminary experiments using highspeed camera.\nThe middle field matrix has 48 receivers, but just 16 receivers were actually used as the analog-digital converter stage had 16 analog inputs only.

The\noperational amplifiers used (OP-AMPS) are OPA656 with 500 MHz unity gain bandwidth and feedback components of Cy=10 pF and Gy=1/200 kQ. Afterwards, logarithmic amplifiers (AD8307ARZ) are used to increase the signal difference between the measurements when they are small. At last, there are other operational amplifiers, OPA656, to prepare adequately the\nanalog signals prior to submitting these to the ADC for digitization. One can see in Figure 4.8 the transmission circuit board built in this work.\nFigure 4.7 - Reception circuit schematic.\nAt low frequencies (f<100's MHz), the admittance of a fluid can be modeled as a conductance (Gx) in parallel with a capacitance (Cx) (SIHVOLA, 1999). The conductance is Gx=kgOx and the capacitance is Cx=kse0\u00a3x, where kg is a variable associated to the electrodes shape and the film thickness, ox is the equivalent conductivity, s0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.85 pF/m) and sx is equivalent relative permittivity. Assuming that the equivalent conductivity and permittivity are dominated by the water values (aw= 0.00412 S/m and \u00a3w=80), the gain of the auto-balancing bridge will be\n= kg\t+ j\t)\nUn\tGf + j 2^fCf\t'\t'\nAt the work frequency, 5 MHz, eq. (4.1) denominator is approximately equal to j2nfCf and the numerator is ^(0.00412 +/0.0222) S/m. Thus, the capacitive part contribution is 84.4%. Therefore, the circuit is dominated by the capacitive component. This approach is rough, but it is enough for practical analysis.\nThe output of the circuit is proportional to the fluids capacitance over the pair Tx-Rx,\nU = A ln(UOMi) + B\t(4.2)\nwhere\nC\nU = -\u2014U\nout\tin\nCf\t(4.3)\nand A and B depend on the geometric parameters and circuit parameters. Given that the geometric parameters change during the measurements, A and B cannot be estimated for all the cases.\nInstead, to solve Eq. (4.2), an empirical approximation is used to correlate the film thickness (6) with Ux. The empirical relation is established by a calibration process proposed by Damsohn\n(2011), section 2.7.2.1, Known water-film thickness is produced over the sensor and the output voltage is recorded, for each thickness. At last, it is possible to obtain an equation relating the water-film thickness and the output voltage.\nIn order to minimize the variation in the circuit parameters and the possible deposition of oil on the sensor surface, a measurement of voltage with the system saturated ( U sat, i.e. the\nsensor covered with water with a bigger thickness than the thickness of saturation) is made during the process of calibration and before and after each experimental run in the pipeline. Thus, the dimensionless voltage (\t) is defined as\nU Dimensionless Voltage = U'\nUsat\t(4 4)\n,8 Logarithmic Amplifiers\nAD8307ARZ\n16 OP-AMPS OPA656\n8 Logarithmic Amplifiers\n8307ARZ\n16 OP-AMPS\nOPA656\nFigure 4.8 - Homemade reception circuit board.\n4.5\tAnalog-Digital Converter\nThe output-voltage signals (after the logarithmic amplifiers) are converted to digital signals by a digitizer NI 5751. This is an analog-digital converter with 16 simultaneously sampled 50 MS/s channels, DC coupling, input impedance of 50Q and 14-bit resolution. This converter admits a maximum input voltage of 1V peak. For this constraint, the output voltage must be adapted, making necessary to use a special circuit to couple (to 50 Q impedance) and to limit.\n4.6\tFPGA\nA FPGA Flex Rio PXIe7962R is used to control the measurement system. The FPGA features are listed in Table 4.4.\nTable 4.4 - PXIe7962R features.\nFPGA\tFPGA Slices\tFPGA DSP Slices\tBlock RAM\tOnboard Memory (DRAM)\nVirtex-5 SX50T\t8,160\t288\t4,752 kbit\t512 MB\nThe FPGA has two state machines. The machines control the synchronization between the transmitter circuit board (Figure 4.4), the digitizer (NI 5751) and the computer. Figure 4.9 shows\nthe Acquisition State Machine and Figure 4.10 shows the Control State Machine. Both machines run at 50 MHz.\nA new whole acquisition begin when the variable \u2018Reset_WMS\u2019 is activated. When this command is received, the first task is to reset the Acquisition State Machine, Figure 4.9. Later, the Control State Machine creates a set of signals to synchronize the transmitter (Tx) lines and the sampling instant. Also, creates the signal to synchronize the high-speed camera. A counter \u2018Ctr_Fr\u2019 compares the number of frames acquired with the number of desired frames \u2018Frames\u2019, when the counter reaches the desired number, the generation of synchronization signals stops. Finally, the machine returns to the initial state, ready to start a new whole acquisition.\nThe signals generated during the state \u2018Acq_WMS\u2019 are shown in Figure 4.11. The first step is to reset the Acquisition State Machine. After, trough the signal \u2018Tx_Clk\u2019, a pulse changes the actual Tx, activating the Tx0. The signal to trigger the acquisition process is delayed to allow the propagation and stabilization of the signal. Each time that the Tx0 is active, i.e. begins a new frame, a pulse is generated in Fr_Clk. It is used to synchronize the high-speed camera.\nThe Acquisition State Machine, Figure 4.9, receives the trigger signal \u2018DI0\u2019 generated by the Control State Machine. When the trigger is received, DI0=\u20191\u2019, one sample of each receiver (Rx) line is taken and it is sent to the computer. It is possible take several samples, \u2018Sp/C\u2019, each time that one Tx is activated. In this work, just one sample is taken when a Tx is active. A counter Ctr_Sp/C stores the number of samples taken by each Tx. When the number of samples is reached the machine returns to the initial state.\nFigure 4.9 - Control State Machine\nFigure 4.10 - Acquisition State Machine.\nFigure 4.11 - Signals of control.\nTrig/DIO\nA n\tn\t\tn\tr\t\t> \t2\nTxO A\tTxl\t\tTxl5\tTxO\t\n\tn\tn\t\tn\tn /\nA\tTgO\tTgl\t\tTgl 5\tTgO\n0\t\t\t\tc\t\tI\n4.7\tComputer\nThe digitalized signals are sent and processed in a computer.

The configuration used in the experiments can be seen in Table 4.6.

There are several methods for correcting, minimizing or preventing optical distortion caused by pipe curvature (WITT et al., 2008; LOWE &amp; KUTT, 1992; NARROW et al., 2000; BUDWIG, 1994). Some tests were carried out using a transparent box filled with fluids with different refractive indexes, but close to that of the pipe material. Another attempt was made by using a solid acrylic box designed and constructed as an independent piece and then installed in the horizontal pipeline (Figure 4.13b). The latter showed the best results.\nThe next stage was to select a pattern length to insert into the visualization section for image calibration. A 0.2 mm x 0.2 mm square pattern length was chosen after preliminary tests (Figure 4.13c). The square pattern was attached to a piece of acrylic and placed within the acrylic box in the center of the tube and perpendicular to the camera view (Figure 2b). Another acrylic box constructed with the same dimensions of the previous one was used for the flow visualization (Figure 4.14). It is important to note that the flow is recorded upstream of the pattern, as shown in Figure 4.14, with the mixture flowing from bottom to top. This configuration ensures that the pattern does not disturb the flow.\nFor the lighting system, two LED lamps of 30W and 2300 lumen were used. Preliminary lighting tests were also made in order to find the best configuration/position of the lamps to obtain sharper images and a good contrast between the phases, oil and water. The lighting arrangement that presented best results was the one with the lamps positioned at the back and the\nbottom of the section. In addition, a halogen lamp was located above the visualization section\nduring the tests.\na)\tb)\nFigure 4.13 - (a) Camera setup; (b) Side view of the acrylic box with the square pattern attached;\nc)\n(c) Square pattern used for image calibration (0.2mm<2mm).\nFigure 4.14 - Detail of visualization section\n4.9\tSetup Preparation\nAs mentioned before, the planar sensor was made of a flexible material, which allowed it to be taped to the internal wall of the tube. An especial union was designed and manufactured to insert the sensor between two sections of the tube, including a visualization system.\nSpecial flanges made of 4 parts of aluminum were used. Two of them give support to the sensor, emulating the internal walls of the tube. The first piece was designed to let the internal face of the sensor fit with the internal face of the tube; i.e. to guarantee the same radius. The sensor was glued on that support, Figure 4.15. The second piece completes the sensor wall, Figure 4.16. Two circular flanges were used as guide system for the support pieces, letting a perfect match, Figure 4.17. A plate of aluminum gives support to the connectors of the sensor. This part was isolated from the sensor to avoid short-circuit. The pieces were made by the technician H\u00e9lio Trebi.\nThe planar sensor was located just upstream the visualization section, which consisted of two transparent acrylic pieces, which allowed the direct visualization of the flow pattern inside the tube. In addition, the visualization section permits the mounting of a traditional WMS between the acrylic pieces for cross-sectional tomography. The second piece contains the image calibration pattern, as will be presented in the next section. Figure 4.18 shows an exploded-view drawing and a photograph of the entire system placed in the pipeline. The installation was possible with the help of the technicians H\u00e9lio Trebi and Jose Bogni. Every day the entire system had to be disassembled and cleaned up to avoid damaging the sensor. The possible damages include oxidation, accumulation of oil on the surface, growing of humidity inside the sensor,\namong others.\nFigure 4.15 - Flexible planar sensor mounted on its support piece.\n69\nFigure 4.16 - Flexible planar sensor installed between the two pieces. It is possible to see the\nsensor is over a half wall of the pipe.\nFigure 4.17 - Flexible planar sensor and support pieces with the flange.\na)\nb)\nFigure 4.18 - a) Exploded-view drawing showing the planar sensor and visualization section. b)\nPhoto of the entire system placed in the pipeline.\n4.10\tExperimental Procedure\nThe experimental procedure had the following steps:\n1)\tThe pipe was first filled with water, the measurement system saturation data and an image of the square pattern were recorded (Figure 4.19).\n2)\tExperiments begin with single-phase water flow. After some time, oil is gradually added. Once the flow pattern is steady, i.e. when the oil and water superficial velocities do not vary, the acquisition systems are activated. As a result, the capacitance system starts the measurements and high-speed camera begins to record the flow. The duration of each measurement was of 1 second with 5000 frames collected. Figure 4.20 shows snapshots of flows of mixtures with different oil and water superficial velocities, Vso and VSW, respectively. It is possible to observe strips\nnear the pipe wall free of oil droplets, at the left and right side of the image, which is the object of this investigation. In red are marked the regions of interest for film\nthickness measurements (Figure 4.20).\nFigure 4.19 - Square pattern and visualization section with the pipe filled with water.\n3)\tThe holdup is then measured. For this purpose, two quick-closing valves are closed to trap the mixture in a 3.5-meter-length section, while another valve is simultaneously opened to allow the flow through the bypass. It was necessary to wait for a half an hour to allow the oil-water separation for annular flow experiments and for an hour for dispersed oil-in-water flow experiments. Afterwards, the oil-water interface is located and the oil holdup is calculated as follows:\nh =\no\noil-water-interface length m\n3.5\tm\n(4.5)\n4)\tThe pipe was cleaned with water and new measurement system saturation data were recorded.\n5)\tThe last step consists in data treatment and processing of the images for quantification of water-film thickness.\na)\nFigure 4.20 - Images of the oil-water flow. (a) Unstable annular flow Vsw =0.56 m/s, Vso =0.5 m/s;\nb)\n(b) dispersed oil-in-water flow Vsw=1.12 m/s, Vso =0.4 m/s. In red are marked the regions of\ninterest for the measurements of water-film thickness.\n74\n5\tFILM THICKNESS MEASUREMENT IN OIL-WATER PIPE\nFLOW USING IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUE\nHigh-speed-camera images of the flow were processed to obtain data of average water-film thickness which could be used to validate the capacitive measurement system. An automatic processing algorithm was proposed. The proposed algorithm has the following stages: (i) preprocessing, (ii) segmentation and (iii) film thickness estimation. The first task was to improve the images, because the dispersed oil-in-water flow images had noise and low contrast, which makes the image processing difficult. Afterwards, image segmentation was applied to separate oil regions and water regions. Hence, it was possible to estimate the water film thickness from the segmented images. The methods used at each stage were selected through qualitative and quantitative comparisons.\nThe experimental setup and methods are shown. Thereafter, the image processing algorithm used to measure the film thickness is described. Results are presented and compared against predictions of a model available in the literature.\n5.1\tExperimental Setup\nThe images were recorded with a high-speed video camera (Olympus ispeed3, at 5000 fps) in the Multiphase-Flow-Loop Test Facility of LETeF (Thermal-Fluids Engineering Laboratory), Engineering School of S\u00e3o Carlos of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo. The camera was installed at 10.3 m from the tube entrance of a horizontal transparent acrylic pipeline of 26 mm-I.D. and 12 m length, Figure 5.1 (a). Tap water and oil (828 kg/ m 3 of density and 22 0 c P at 25\u00b0 C) were used as test fluids. The experiments were made possible with the help of Dr. Iara Hernandez.\nThe experimental procedure started with single-phase water flow. After some time, oil was gradually added. After reaching steady state, the high-speed camera was activated. Figure 5.1 (b and c) shows frames for two experiments with different oil and water superficial velocities\t. It is possible to observe small regions clearly dominated by water at the top\nand bottom of the pipe, near to the wall.\nIn this study measurements were made for mixture superficial velocities varying from 3.1 to 4.2 m/s and input oil fractions from 0.14 to 0.43, in total 12 experimental points. The acquisition rate was 5000 frames/second and were acquired two seconds by experiment.\na)\nFigure 5.1 - a) Camera experiments setup. Images dispersed oil-in-water flow pattern; b: (a)\nV;W = 2.5 m/s,VS0 = 1.2 m/s; (b) V;w = 2.5 m/s,VS0 = 1.5 m/s. In red are marked the regions\nof interest used to film thickness measurements.\nb)\nc)\n5.2\tImage Processing\nAn automatic image-processing algorithm is proposed in Figure 5.2. The algorithm includes pre-processing, segmentation and film thickness estimation. The pre-processing includes cutting, improving and calibrating the image. In the segmentation stage it is important to select a suitable method to manipulate such images, for instance in Bonilla Riano, Bannwart, &amp; Rodriguez, (2013) two segmentation methods were tested for oil-water core-annular flow image analysis. Finally, the average water film thickness is calculated in the film thickness estimation stage.\nf\nOriginal image\nPreprocessing\nSegmentation\nFilm, thickness estimation\nAverage water film thickness\n*\nFigure 5.2 - Proposed algorithm for the film thickness calculation.\n5.2.1\tPre-Processing\nThe images of dispersed oil-in-water flow present noise and low contrast, which makes the\nprocessing image difficult. The purpose of image enhancement is to improve the interpretability 76\nof information contained in the image for providing a \u201cbetter\u201d input for other automated image processing systems (KAUR et al., 2011). The image enhancement algorithm receives an original image, applies a set of intermediate steps on that image, and finally outputs the enhanced image. There are many techniques for improving image quality. Some popular techniques are contrast improvement, edge enhancement (e.g. deblurring), spatial (e.g. averaging, median, Wiener, frost filters) and frequency filtering (Fourier and Wavelet domain)(GONZALES &amp; WOODS, 2002).\n5.2.1.1\tContrast improvement\nThe images of the dispersed oil-water flow present non-uniform illumination and low contrast. Contrast enhancement techniques expand the range of brightness values in an image, thus the effect is to increase the visual contrast between two areas of different uniform densities. A histogram based contrast improvement was selected for that purpose.\nGiven a gray scale image with L levels of gray, the gray intensity histogram is the number of pixels in the image N g that have intensity equal to g.\nh ( g ) = '\t(5.1)\nHistograms are frequently normalized by the total number of pixels of the image. Assuming an M x N image, a normalized histogram is:\nMN (5.\nwhere is the probability of occurrence of in the image. The sum of all components of a normalized histogram is equal to 1.\nThe histogram of a low contrast image is usually skewed either to the left (mostly dark), or to the right (mostly light). In our case, the values are in the left side, Figure 5.3.\n8000\nFigure 5.3 - (a) Instantaneous image; (b) histogram. Flow conditions: Vsw =2.5 m/s and Vso =1.2 m/s.\nContrast stretching is a point image enhancement method that attempts to improve an image by stretching the range of gray values, i.e., to use all the possible values. A disadvantage of the method of histogram stretching is that they require user input. This method was not used in this case because it is non-practical to study each histogram to estimate the lower and upper gray levels (we have 120000 images).\nIn Histogram Equalization (HE), the gray pixel value of enhanced image depends on the global value of the respective pixel of the original image. It is the probability density function (pdf) that will be transformed, i.e., it changes the pdf of a given image into one of a uniform pdf that spreads out from the lowest pixel value to the highest pixel value ( L - 1) . In a digital image, the pdf is a discrete function that can be approximated by using the probability based on the histogram , as follows:\nN\nPdf(x') = p(g) =\t^.\t(5.3)\nFrom this pdf, we can then obtain the cumulative density function (cdf) as follows:\nL-1\ncdf (x ) = ^pdf (x).\t(5.4)\ng=0\nThe transformed pixel can be obtained by:\ntt = floor ( cfd (x)(L-1))\t(5.5)\nwhere floor rounds to the nearest integer (BAGADE &amp; SHANDILYA, 2011).\nHE can be a good approach when automatic enhancement is required, even though there are cases where it may not be the best approach, causing results extremes (SINGH et al., 2011).\nThe method Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) computes several histograms, each corresponding to a distinct region of the image, and applies the histogram equalization to each one with a defined distribution. The objective of the process is to improve the local contrast of an image.\nThe method uses a limit parameter value of the histogram in order to obtain adequate brightness and contrast on the enhanced image. The contrast limit is controlled on the histogram equalization process. A criterion for the desired histogram distribution is defined based on the contrast range of the original image. The criterion for histogram distribution is either uniform, exponential, or Rayleigh. Therefore, the natural properties of the original image can be maintained since the distribution form is not significantly changed after enhancement process (JULIASTUTI &amp; EPSILAWATI, 2012).\n5.2.1.2\tDenoising\nNoise is any degradation in the image signal, caused by any external disturbance. Digital images may be contaminated by a variety of types of noise. Noise is the result of errors in the image acquisition process that result in pixel values that do not reflect the true values of the real scene. Generally, noisy pixels appear as dots with different gray levels with respect to its neighborhood. These points appear random or distributed systematically. Image noise can be classified as impulse noise, Gaussian noise, Poisson noise, quantization noise, film grain, nonisotropic noise, multiplicative noise and periodic noise (VERMA &amp; ALI, 2013). Following are described some noises that can contaminate dispersed oil-in-water flow images.\nIn impulse noise or salt-and-pepper noise, the noise arises in the image because of sharp and sudden changes of image signal. In this type of noise only two values are possible, a and b, and the probability of obtaining each of them is less than 0.1. For instance in an 8 bits image, the typical value for pepper noise is close to 0 and for salt is close to 255.\nGaussian or amplifier noise is caused by random fluctuations in the signal. Some sources of Gaussian noise are: different gains in the sensor, electrical noise in the digitizers, poor\nillumination and high temperature, between others. The Gaussian noise has a normal probability distribution function, i.e., the values that the noise can take on are Gaussian-distributed.\nPoisson or shot photon noise arises when the number of photons sensed by the sensor is not sufficient to provide detectable statistical information. This noise has root mean square value proportional to square root intensity of the image.\nNoise reduction (denoising) in digital images has been studied for many years. Image denoising methods can be categorized as either spatial domain methods or transform domain methods. Spatial domain methods suppress noise directly in the spatial domain (e.g., spatial filtering). Transform domain methods first transform an image from the spatial domain into a different domain (e.g., frequency domain, wavelet domain) and suppress noise in the transform domain (GONZALES &amp; WOODS, 2002). According to noise nature and its characteristics, a given denoising method can be more effective than another. Some of these methods are presented below.\nSpatial filtering techniques are transformations pixel by pixel, depending not only on the gray level of the pixel, but also on the value of the gray levels of neighboring pixels. The filtering process is performed using masks, which are applied on the image. Applying the mask centered at the pixel P( i,j), where i is the row number and j the column number in the image, means to replace the pixel value at position for a new value, where the value depends on the values of neighboring pixels and weights on the mask. Examples of such filters are averaging filters, median filters and adaptive filters.\nAveraging filters replace each pixel value in an image with the average value of its neighbors, including itself. This has the effect of eliminating pixel values which are unrepresentative of their surroundings. The result will depend on the window size, i.e., the number of pixels averaged. Its implementation can be generalized as the sum of the pixel values in the region multiplied by a set of mask weights ( UX,y), Eq. (5.6). This process results in an image with reduced \u201csharp\u201d transitions in gray levels and less noise because random noise typically consists of sharp transitions in gray levels. Nevertheless, edges (which almost always are desirable features of an image) also are characterized by sharp transitions in gray levels, so averaging filters have the undesirable side effect that they blur edges.\nm\nP(i,j) - \u00a3 W^P^j\t(5.6)\nx,y=-m\nwhere m represents the size of the mask, P is the pixel value.\nIn median filters, the gray level of each pixel is replaced by the median of the gray levels in the neighborhood. For example, in a neighborhood of 3x3 pixels, the median is the fifth largest value; in a neighborhood of 5x5 pixels is the thirteenth largest value, and so on. Median filter is good for salt and pepper noise. The median filter can eliminate the effect of input noise values with extremely large magnitudes. These filters are widely used as smoothers in image processing (GONZALES &amp; WOODS, 2002).\nAn adaptive filter changes its behavior on the basis of statistical characteristics of the image region, encompassed by the filter region. This approach produces good results preserving edges and other high frequency parts of an image. In this work a Wiener filter (JIN et al., 2003) and a frost filter (YU &amp; ACTON, 2002) were used.\nAnother important method of noise reduction is the technique known as \"wavelet shrinkage\". This method was originally proposed by Donoho &amp; Johnstone (1994) and applied by many authors to reduce noise in signals and images (LUISIER et al., 2007; ERGEN, 2012).\nThe wavelet transform is basically a convolution operation, which is equivalent to passing an image through low-pass and high-pass filters. The low frequency image or low frequency subband still contains spatial correlation and by filtering recursively the low frequency image a multi-resolution image representation can be obtained. Thus, the image is decomposed into a set of sub-images with different resolutions for different frequency bands. Most of the wavelet detail coefficients are equal or close to zero in the regions of smooth image intensity variation.\nWavelet denoising consists of three main stages:\n\u2022\tPerform a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to the noisy image.\n\u2022\tApplication of threshold, in order to suppress coefficients due to noise.\n\u2022\tReconstruct the denoised image by applying the inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT) on the processed highpass wavelet subimages to obtain an estimate of the noise-free image.\nThere are some variables of the wavelet denoising method of images to be studied: the wavelet function and the level N of wavelet decomposition, the wavelet thresholding function and the threshold itself.\n5.2.1.3\tDeblurring\nDenoising reduces the noise level but the resultant image could be blurred or over smoothed due to losses like edges or lines. Unsharp filter was selected to deblurring the images after the denoising step. The Unsharp filter enhances edges (and other high frequency components in an image) via a procedure which subtracts an unsharp or smoothed version of an image from the original image (GONZALES &amp; WOODS, 2002).\n5.2.2\tSegmentation\nSegmentation is the separation of digital images in multiple regions that are homogeneous with respect to one or more attributes (GONZALES &amp; WOODS, 2002). For the pre-processed dispersed oil-water flow images, it is assumed that there are two different classes: oil and water.\n5.2.2.1\tSegmentation by Thresholding\nThresholding is the most basic pixel-based segmentation. The application of this method results in a binary image with different objects. Depending on the application, objects are represented by a gray level 0 (white) and the background is represented as 1 (black) or vice versa.\nOne way to remove objects to the background is to choose a threshold . Thus, any point for which\tis called object, in the opposite case the point is called background\n(GONZALEZ &amp; PEREZ, 1987).\nThere are many algorithms to calculate the threshold. The first one used in this work was Otsu's algorithm, which is one of the classical methods. The pixels of the image are divided into two classes, with gray levels\tand with gray levels\t. The gray level\nprobability distributions\tfor the two classes are:\nT\nw = Pr(Q = 2 p( g),\n=\t(5.7)\nL-1\nw2 =Pr(Q = 2 p( g).\ni=T+1\t(5.8)\nThe means of the classes (\t) are\nT\nPi=2 gp( g)/ w1\u2019\ng=0\t(5.9)\n&amp; = \u00a3 gP(g)/ W2.\ng=T+1\t(5.10)\nThe class variances (\t) are given by\nT\n= S(g p)2 p( g) / Pr(c1)\u2019\ng=0\nL-1\n(5.11)\n^ = S (g -P2?P(g)/Pr(C2).\ng=T+1\nThe intra-class variance (\t) is\n(5.12)\n2 2 , 2\n\u00b0w = W1\u00b01 + W2^2.\t(5.13)\nThe Otsu method chooses the optimal threshold T by minimizing the intra-class variance (OTSU, 1979; BINDU, 2009).\nThe second one is the ISODATA algorithm, which is an iterative algorithm. In general, it assigns an arbitrary initial value of threshold. The second step classifies each pixel to the closest\nclass. In the third step, the mean values and /z2) of each class are estimated using Gaussian\ndistribution. In the next step it is calculated a new threshold as\t. The second and third\nsteps are repeated until the change between the iteration is small enough (DIAS, 1980; EL-ZAART, 2010).\nThe last one is fuzzy partition and Tsallis entropy based thresholding (SARKAR &amp; DAS, 2013). In this case, the image is divided into different classes by selecting multiple threshold points by performing fuzzy partition on a 2D histogram based on fuzzy relation and maximum fuzzy entropy principle. The entire distribution is divided into n classes, and the Tsallis entropy for each distribution is determined as\nP(g)M\u201e\nWn\tj\n(5.14)\nwhere is a real positive parameter not equal to one and is the fuzzy membership function.\nThe optimum value of parameters can be obtained by maximizing the total entropy\n<P = Arg max\t+H\u201c +...+ H + (1 -\u00abnn\u201c...n\u201c]).\t15)\n5.2.2.2\tMathematical Morphology\nMathematical morphology is a non-linear image processing technique. Morphology operates on image regions that can be reshaped under the control of a structuring element. It is composed of two basic operators: erosion and dilatation. Other operators can be defined based in these two basic operations, for example opening and closing (HARALICK et al., 1987).\nThe proposed algorithm for segmentation using mathematical morphology may be split up into the following steps: converting the grayscale image to a binary image, selecting the structuring element for the image, applying dilation operator until most of the holes are filled (typically two times), which was necessary because the non-uniform illumination produced holes on the oil region, applying erosion operator, applying open operator and classifying (black area will be denoted as the homogeneous mixture of oil and water and white area as the water phase).\n5.2.2.3\tWavelet Transform\nThe main feature of the wavelet transform for segmentation is that it is capable of representing a signal in the spectral and temporal domain simultaneously (KURNAZ et al., 2003). The pixels features are extracted after the Wavelet transform, i.e. forming for each original pixel a feature vector. This feature vector is composed by the original gray value and five intensities from sub-images approximation coefficients at the same coordinate.\nFor classification, self-organizing neural networks were used in Kurnaz et al. (2003), but k-means or any other unsupervised learning algorithm could be used. In our work, fuzzy c-means and k-means algorithms were used.\nK-means\nIt is a cluster analysis technique that classifies elements into groups or clusters. Based on a data matrix , the function minimized in the classification process is the sum of squared errors.\nIn practice, the technique is based on the following iterative algorithm, given an initial partition in clusters:\n1.\tCalculation of positions of the centroids x(fc) of the K clusters.\n2.\tFor each item, calculate its distance from the K centroids.\n3.\tReallocation of each object to the cluster whose centroid is closest (KANUNGO et al., 2002).\nFuzzy c-means\nClassification by fuzzy C-means (FCM) is a technique that has been applied successfully in image segmentation. Since an image can be defined by its characteristics, the FCM algorithm performs the classification of the image by grouping pixels with similar characteristics. This group is improved iteratively minimizing the cost function depending on the distance of pixels to the cluster centers in the characteristic domain.\nThe FCM algorithm generates a partition of the data set using a membership function. To do this, we minimize iteratively the objective function J defined as:\nN c\numi x. - V. i II J I\n(5.16)\nwhere is the degree of membership of pixel in the i-th cluster, is the centroid of the i-th\ncluster and is the weight parameter that determines the degree to which members of a group\naffect the classification outcome.\nThe cost of the objective function is minimized when pixels near the centroid of their group are given a high degree of membership. The membership function represents the probability that\nthe pixel belongs to a particular group, this probability depends only on the distance between the\npixel and the centroid of each group in the characteristic domain. The membership function and centroid are defined as follows, respectively:\nN\nj=1\n(5.18)\nN\nV =\nj=1\nThe algorithm starts with default values for the centroid groups; FCM converges to a solution for representing the local minimum of the objective function. Convergence is\ndetected by comparing changes in the membership function through changes in the centroids values in consecutive iterations.\n5.2.3\tFilm Thickness Estimation\nThe segmented images are calibrated to establish the relationship between pixel and length magnitudes, i.e., to determine what a pixel represents in terms of size or distance. The calibration was made using as square pattern with squares of 0.2 mm x 0.2 mm. The pixel scale factor (PSF) obtained was 0.06 mm/pixel near to the pipe wall and 0.05 mm/pixel near to the pipe center.\nFigure 5.16f shows an example of a segmented image where black represents oil and white represents water. Considering the flow lateral projection, the rows are in the horizontal direction (each row has its own pixel scale factor - PSF) and the columns are in the vertical direction. The water film thickness is estimated from a segmented image multiplying each white pixel (p ixe ln) by the corresponding PSF (PSFn) and adding the results by columns.\nNPw\n6 = Y\t^PSF\u201e,\n\u00ab=!\t(5.19)\nwhere Npw is the number of white pixels in a column.\nFigure 5.4 is the magnification of a small portion of the image. The value in millimeters of the pixel of each row is showed at the right side and the sum result for each column is showed at the bottom. For instance, there are two pixels segmented as water in Column 2. The value in mm of the pixels is 0.06 mm, for both rows (Row 1 and Row 2). Thus, the sum for that column, i.e., the local water film thickness is equal to 0.12 mm.\nPixel Value\n5\nRow 1\nRow 2\nRow 3\nRow 4\nRow 5\nColumn\n1\nColumn\n2\nColumn\n3\nColumn\n4\nColumn\n5\nColumn\n6\n0.06 mm\n0.06 mm\n0.06 mm\n0.06 mm\n0.06 mm\n0.06mm\t0.12mm\t0.18mm\t0.18mm\t0.24mm\n0mm\nFigure 5.4 - Illustration of estimation of water film thickness.\nWater film thickness by column\nThe averaged water-film thickness (<5) is determined as:\n( 1\nA\n\u00a3=\u2014\nN\nNframes\nz\nNcolumns\nY F\nColumn frames frame=l\\N colunms Column=l\nf frame\n(5.20)\nN\nwhere Vy ames is the total number of frames collected for each experiment (10000 frames, in this case), Nco Zunms is the number the columns in one frame, and Fco Zunms is the water film thickness\nmeasured in each column of the image.\n5.3\tResults of the Image Processing Algorithms\n5.3.1\tImage Pre-Processing\nIn the pre-processing step, each image corresponding to each experimental point was improved using the proposed algorithm. A total of 120,000 images were processed. First, each method presented in the section 5.2.1 was applied to the images to compare their results and select the best technique.\nThe performance of image enhancement methods can be evaluated using quality metrics. Given an original image x0 with V columns and M rows, after an enhancement process is obtained an improved image x e with the same size. The quality parameters used in this paper are in Table 5.1 (PAVITHRA et al., 2010).\n5.3.1.1\tContrast Enhancement Results\nHistogram equalization and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization were tested. The results of image enhancement of the same image with several methods and also plot of histogram distribution are showed on Figure 5.5 and Figure 5.6.\nAccording to the quality metrics the best method for contrast improvement for the tested images was CLAHE with Rayleigh distribution. CLAHE with Rayleigh have better values in MSE, MAE, MD and PSNR, following by CLAHE with exponential distribution, Figure 5.7.\nTable 5.1 - Quality metrics used to compare the enhancement methods.\nMetric\tDefinition\tEquation\tBetter quality if\nMean Squared Error (MSE)\tGlobal difference between an enhanced image and an original image.\tN-l M-l mse = tMYY(xo (n'm 0 0 \u2014 xe(n, m))2\tLow value\nMean Average Error (MAE)\tAverage magnitude of the errors.\tN-l M-l M ae=Wm'ZYIx\u00b0 (n\u2019m) 0 0 \u2014 x e (n, m) |\tLow value\nPeak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR)\tComparison between noise and signal peak.

This blur increases with the mask size. It can be seen that correlation between image characteristic related with performance of image enhancement method is close (Figure 5.8 and Figure 5.9). In this case, the best tested filtering method was Wiener filter with mask of 3x3.\nA series of steps were made to find the best combination of parameters for Wavelet noise reduction. First, different Wavelets functions were compared. Those Wavelet functions were: Haar, Daubechies (db) from 2 to 40, Symlets (sym) from 1 to 8, Coiflets (coif) from 1 to 5, biorthogonal (bior) from 1.1 to 6.8 and reverse biorthogonal (rbio) from 1.1 to 6.8. Noise reduction was performed with WDT with two-level decomposition and the soft Rigrsure threshold. In the second step were tested different levels of decomposition (1 to 40), using the best Wavelet function found in the previous step and at last were compared two classical thresholds (soft threshold and hard threshold). The main image quality metric was PSNR. Figure\n5.10\tshows Wavelet denoising results with different Wavelet functions, on the top are presented the best cases and immediately after the worst cases, chosen by their PSNR.\nIn accordance to the results of the image quality metrics MSE, MAE, PSNR, SC and MD (Figure 5.11 and Table 5.2), the best parameters for Wavelet denoising are: Wavelet function reverse biorthogonal 4.4 (rbio4.4), one decomposition level and threshold hard. In Figure 5.12 is presented a Wavelet denoising result to an image. It has been found that wavelet based denoising is effective in noise reduction with edge features without much damage.\nBest cases\nrbio4.4 PSNR 27.04 dB\trbio6.8 PSNR 27.03 dB\nrbio5.5 PSNR 27.02 dB\tbior6.8 PSNR 27.07 dB\ncoif3 PSNR 26.9 dB\tbior4.4 PSNR 26.9 dB\nWorst cases\nrbio3.1 PSNR 22.7 dB\tbior3.1 PSNR 26.4 dB\nFigure 5.10 - Visual enhancement results of wavelet denoising using different Wavelet functions\nfor one image Vsw =2.5 m/s, Vso =1.2 m/s.\nMSE\tMAE\tMD\nrbio4.4 rbio6.8\nrbio5.5 bior6.8\ncoif3 bior4.4 bior3.1 rbio3.1\n30\n25 -\n20-\n15-\n10-\n5-\nPSNR\nrbio4.4\nrbio6.8\nrbio5.5 bior6.8 coif3 bior4.4 bior3.1 rbio3.1\n\u25a0\u25a0nmnM\u25a0\u25a0nmnwa\nSC\tContrast\n0\na)\tb)\nFigure 5.11 - Mean of image quality metrics for different Wavelet; a) MSE, MAE and MD; b)\nPSNR, SC and Contrast.\nTable 5.2 - Mean of image quality metrics for different levels and thresholds.\n\t\tMSE\tMAE\tPSNR\tSC\tMD\tContrast\nLevels\t1\t121.72\t7.68\t27.98\t1.015\t73.07\t0.984\n\t2\t149.13\t8.32\t27.03\t1.019\t83.55\t0.981\n\t3\t162.36\t8.68\t26.60\t1.022\t86.65\t0.979\n\t4\t170.99\t8.98\t26.35\t1.026\t88.02\t0.976\n\t5\t175.18\t9.14\t26.24\t1.028\t87.62\t0.973\nThreshold\tHard\t111.72\t7.42\t28.40\t1.013\t55.75\t0.985\n\tSoft\t121.72\t7.68\t27.98\t1.015\t73.07\t0.984\na)\tb)\nFigure 5.12 - Visual enhancement results of Wavelet denoising for one image Vsw =2.5 m/s, Vso\n=1.2 m/s; a) original image; b) Denoised image.\n5.3.1.3\tDeblurring\nAn example of application of Unsharp filtering is presented in Figure 5.13.\na)\tb)\nFigure 5.13 - Visual enhancement results of unsharp filtering for one image Vsw =2.5 m/s, Vso=1.2\nm/s; a) original image; b) enhancement image\n5.3.1.4\tProposed Algorithm\nSubsequent to have the outcome of every technique is necessary to determine how will be the sequence of the algorithm for improving dispersed oil-in-water flow images. The proposal is to use the best proven techniques combined. The possible combination were implemented and compared. The techniques combined were CLAHE with Rayleigh distribution (Contrast in Figure 5.14), Wavelet denoising with rbio4.4 Wavelet, one decomposition level and hard thresholding (Denoising in Figure 5.14) and unsharp filter (Unsharp in Figure 5.14). The most favorable\noption is appliying the techniques in the sequence Wavelet denoising, Unsharp filtering and\nCLAHE with Rayleigh distribution (orange in Figure 5.14). The proposed combination has the\nlowest values of MSE, MAE, MD; the highest PSNR and the visual result is better than using an\nsingle method, Figure 5.15.\na)\tb)\nFigure 5.14 - Mean of image quality metrics for different combinations; a) MSE, MAE and MD;\nb) PSNR, SC and Contrast.\nFigure 5.15 - Visual enhancement results of different combinations for one image Vsw =2.5 m/s,\nVso =1.2 m/s; a) Original image; b) after Wavelet denoising; c) Denoised image after unsharp\nfiltering; d) Unsharped image after contrast improvement with CLAHE with Raylegh\ndistribution.\n5.3.2\tSegmentation\nSome frames were segmented manually and these images were compared with the automatic segmented images provided by different methods: morphology, thresholding (Otsu, ISODATA, Fuzzy), Wavelet (with K-Means and C-Means) and the proposed combined method.\nHence, a manually segmented frame (Im) of each experiment is used as reference and compared with the image obtained from each automatic segmentation method (Ia). Both segmented images (manual and automatic) are binary, where oil is represented by value 0 and water by value 1. Table 5.3 presents the parameters used to compare the segmentation methods in this work (JACOB &amp; WYAWAHARE, 2013). The results can be seen in Figure 5.17.\nTable 5.3 - Selected parameters used to compare the segmentation methods.\nParameter\tDefinition\tEquation\tImage segmentation better if\nDice coefficient (Dice)\tMeasures the spatial overlap between two binary images. 0% (no overlap) and 100% (perfect agreement)\tD = 2i/.. n Im ) X100% Ia + Im\tHigh value\nJaccard coefficient (Jaccard)\tMeasures the spatial overlap between two binary images. 0% (no overlap) and 100% (perfect agreement)\tJ = 11 a n 1 x100% Ia\tIm\tHigh value\nFalse Positive Dice (FPD)\tMeasures oversegmentation\tFDP = 2(Ia \u00b0Im) x100% I +1 a\tm\tLow value\nFalse Negative Dice (FND)\tMeasures undersegmentation\tFND = 2(Ia \u00b0Im) x100% I +1 a\tm\tLow value\nNumber of Sites of Disagreement (NSD)\tPercentage of different pixels within the manually segmented image and the automatic method.\t1 ( N-IM-1\tA nsd = 1 yy \\i i\\ I *100% nm[\u00bfy^a m)\tLow value\n5.3.2.1\tProposed Combined Method\nFigure 5.16 (b) is shown a snapshot of an image of the water film obtained in the upper part of\nthe pipe.\n(b) Enhanced image\n(c) First Wavelet approximation coefficients\n(d) After the Fuzzy thresholding\n(e) Black and White image\n(f) After Open (Segmented image)\nFigure 5.16 - Segmentation using the proposed combined algorithm for an instantaneous image\n(a) Combined segmentation algorithm\nfor the flow conditions: Esw=3.0m/s and EiO=1.2m/s: (a) Flowchart of combined segmentation\nalgorithm; (b) Enhanced image; (c) Image of first wavelet approximation coefficients; (d) Image after Fuzzy thresholding ; (e) Image in black and white; (f) Segmented image.\nIn accordance to the value of the parameters (quality metrics) and through visual inspection, it was possible to conclude that the proposed combined method presented the best results for the segmentation of the dispersed oil-water flow images (Figure 5.17). Particularly, the Dice and Jaccard parameters are higher, and FDP and NDS present lower values, which indicates that the performance of the proposed segmentation algorithm is better in comparison to the other methods. One can see in Figure 5.18 the segmented images obtained by applying the\ndifferent segmentation methods and the proposed combined method. Figure 5.18 corresponds to the flow condition = 3.0 m/s and l^0 = 1.2 m/s and top side of the pipe. In general, the combined method was able to find the interface between water and oil. The other methods overestimate the water area.\nMorphology\nOtsu\nIsodata\nWavc-et C-means\nWavK-et K-means\nProposed\nFigure 5.17 - Mean of parameters used to compare the segmentation algorithms.\n5.3.3\tFilm Thickness Estimation and Comparison with a Model from the Literature\nOne can see in Table 5.4 the values of film thickness obtained by the combined segmentation method described in Section 3.3 for mixture velocities ( l^) varying from 3.1 to 4.2 m/s and input oil fractions ( c0) from 14% to 43%. For these flow conditions, it was observed a dispersed flow pattern which is characterized by oil droplets uniformly dispersed throughout the continuous water phase. However, a thin water film can be noticed near the pipe wall, i.e., near the top and bottom of the pipe.\nThe water film at the bottom of the pipe was in general thicker than that measured at the upper part of the tube, which is expected because of the density difference between the fluids (oil and water) and the effect of gravity. However, it is possible to observe in Figure 5.19 that with increasing the mixture velocity the film thickness decreases, especially at the bottom of the pipe. The thicknesses measured at the top and bottom of the pipe become closer, indicating a possible formation of a more axisymmetric flow. The bars, in Figure 5.19 and Figure 5.20, represent the uncertainty of the measurements corresponding to the half of the minimum scale of the square pattern used for calibration, i.e. 100 qm, see Figure 4.13.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\n(f)\n(g)\n(h)\n(i)\nFigure 5.18 - Segmentation results obtained from different methods for a snapshot and flow\ncondition Vsw =3.0 m/s and Vso = 1.2 m/s: (a) enhanced image; (b) segmented using morphology;\n(c) segmented by Otsu thresholding; (d) segmented by ISODATA thresholding; (e) segmented\nby fuzzy thresholding; (f) segmented using wavelet and K-Means; (g) segmented using wavelet\nand C-Means; (h) segmented using combined method; (i) manually segmented.\nA phenomenological model has been developed by Rodriguez et al. (2012) and Rodriguez (2014) to predict the water film thickness in dispersed oil-in-water flow. The model is based on the assumption of existence of a thin laminar water film flowing adjacent to the pipe wall and surrounding a turbulent core of oil-water dispersion. It uses pressure-drop, holdup data and physical properties of the fluids to estimate the film thickness.\nThe following average relative error (ARE) is considered in this part of the work:\nN I S -S \\\nX 1\tmodel\ttop\ns s\nARE = 100--------- top--------&lt;[%],\t(5.21)\nN\nwhere&lt;5mo d e z and&lt;5top denote the film thickness predicted by the model and that estimated by image processing using the proposed algorithm, respectively. N is the number of experimental points.\nOne can see in Figure 5.20 a comparison between the film thickness estimated by the proposed visual technique (top side of the pipe) and the film thickness predicted by the model. The model underestimates the experimental data with an average relative error of 34%. Nevertheless, the model captures the trend, i.e., a reduction in the film thickness with increasing the mixture velocity. On the other hand, by inspection of Figure 5.18 one might infer that the proposed visual technique could be overestimating the water film thickness.\nTable 5.4 - Film thickness estimated at the top and bottom of the pipe for different flow\nconditions.\nExp\t% (-)\tFm (m/s)\t<5top (mm)\t^Z>ottoni(mm)\n1\t0.14\t3.5\t0.42\t2.30\n2\t0.19\t3.7\t0.37\t1.68\n3\t0.19\t3.1\t0.48\t2.57\n4\t0.21\t3.8\t0.31\t1.11\n5\t0.24\t3.3\t0.39\t2.10\n6\t0.25\t4.0\t0.35\t0.78\n7\t0.26\t3.4\t0.34\t1.38\n8\t0.29\t4.2\t0.30\t0.66\n9\t0.29\t3.5\t0.43\t1.25\n10\t0.32\t3.7\t0.37\t0.96\n11\t0.38\t3.2\t0.58\t1.31\n12\t0.43\t3.5\t0.34\t0.38\nE E\nE\nb\n\t\u20141\u2014\t\t1\t\t\u2014i\t1\t\t\u2014\t\tr\t\n\t\t\t\tA\t3\t\n\t\t\t\t\ttop\t\n\t\t\t\to\t\u00bf\u00a1bottom\t\n6\t\t2\t\t\t\t\n\t6\t$ 5\t\t\t\t\n\t\t9\t\t\t\t\n\tA\t\t\to\t5\t\n\u25b2\t\t4 a |\t4 A\tA\tA\t-\ni-----------------1---------------1----------------1----------------1----------------r\n3.0\t3.2\t3.4\t3.6\t3.8\t4.0\t4.2\nV/m/s)\nFigure 5.19 - Comparison between the film thicknesses measured at the top and bottom of the pipe using the proposed algorithm for each experiment.\nFigure 5.20 - Comparison between the film thickness predicted by Rodriguez et al.

The selected geometry was simulated at an operational frequency of 5 MHz, and its conductance and capacitance were estimated from the admittance values.\nThe water-film thickness data obtained by the two proposed techniques, visual and capacitive, in unstable annular and dispersed oil-water flow are compared. Finally, the water-film topology is studied.\n6.1\tFinite Elements Model Simulations\n6.1.1\tSelecting a Sensor Geometry\nIt is important to determine the best geometry for measuring water film thickness in oilwater flows. The reason for that is the fact that the sensor design determines the system capabilities from which the most important are spatial resolution and depth sensitivity. Five capacitive sensor geometries (Figure 6.1) were implemented and simulated in Comsol package and Matlab in order to compare their characteristics and choose the best one.\nThe geometries 1 and 3 were designed for an automatic car-wiper system, i.e. they were not used to measure water film thickness (LI &amp; HE, 2011). The geometry 2 was proposed for nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of materials (CHEN, 2012). The geometry 4 (SILVA et al., 2007) and 5 (DAMSOHN &amp; PRASSER, 2009) were designed and tested for water film thickness in gas-water flow and oil-water mixtures, respectively.\nThe sensors behaviors were studied by solving the three-dimensional potential equation within the liquid film on top of the sensor electrode system using finite elements method, refer to section 3.4.\nThe optimum size for the geometry 5 (Figure 6.1e) was determined in Tiwari et al. (2014). This geometry sensor had its shape and size of the transmitting, receiving and ground electrodes optimized with the purpose of having quasi linear characteristic for low film thicknesses, high measurement depth, minimization of cross-talk phenomenon and high spatial resolution.\na) Geometry 1\nb) Geometry 2\nc) Geometry 3\nGround\nd) Geometry 4 (Comb)\nI\ne)\tGeometry 5 (Points)\nFigure 6.1 - Selected geometries of planar sensors.\nThe first tested geometry, Figure 6.1a, the pair Tx-Rx is composed by one transmitter electrode, one receiver electrode (as two concentric rings) and a ground electrode.\n102\nThe second geometry, Figure 6.1b, is similar to the first one; the unique difference is that it has the receiver electrode with three concentric rings. Two results for the geometry 1 and the geometry 2 are in Figure 6.2. In this figure, one can see that the geometry 1 and 2 are able to measure film thickness below 600 pm. It is possible to increase the maximum depth reached, increasing the receiver area and/or the distance between the transmitter and the receiver. Table 6.1 presents sizes of the sensors with geometries 1, 2 and 5.\nFigure 6.2 - Summary of simulation results for sensors with geometry 1 and 2.\nTable 6.1 - Sizes of the sensors for geometries 1,2 ,3 and 5.\nGeometry\tSpatial resolution, SXxSY [mm]\tSpacing between Tx and Rx, GAP [mm]\tAnnular ring width, Rx [mm]\tTransmitter size Diameter, Tx [mm]\n1.1\t4 x 4\t0.95\t0.3\t0.5\n1.2\t2 x 2\t0.15\t0.2\t0.5\n2.1\t4 x 4\t0.45\t0.3\t0.5\n2.2\t3.6 x 3.6\t0.25\t0.3\t0.5\n3.1\t2.4 x 2.4\t0.10\t-\t0.5\n3.2\t4 x 4\t0.2\t-\t1.0\n5\t4 x 4\t2.0\t-\t0.9\nThe third geometry, Figure 6.1c, has a transmitter made of four circular parts, surrounded by the receiver, which is circular. A summary of simulation results for the geometry 3 is presented in Figure 6.3, it is clear that the depth reached and the quasi linear characteristic are improved by increasing the receiver area.\nFigure 6.3 - Summary simulation results for sensors with geometry 3.\nThe fourth geometry has a comb shape as shown in Figure 6.1d, the transmitter has four fingers and the receiver has three fingers. Figure 6.4 presents a summary of simulation results for the geometry 4. Correspondingly, Table 6.1 presents the sizes of the sensors with geometries 1 to 3 and 5, and Table 6.2 presents the sizes of the sensors with geometries 4.\nSimilarly, the simulation results (geometry 4) for different finger length and spacing between a transmitter finger and receiver finger are presented in Figure 6.5 and Figure 6.6. In Figure 6.5, the finger size (FX*FY) is 0.170 x 6.12 mm and spacing between a transmitter finger and receiver finger (GAPX) was changed, starting at 0.68 mm and finishing at 2.38 mm. In this case, by increasing the spacing, the film-thickness saturation grows and it decreases the capacitance value. In Figure 6.6, the spacing between a transmitter finger and receiver finger (GAPX) is 1.7 mm, finger size in x (FX) is 0.17 mm and finger size in y (FY) was changed, between 0.68 mm and 5.7 mm. By increasing the finger size, it increases the film thickness saturation and the capacitance value.\nFigure 6.7 shows the simulation results of the fifth geometry (Figure 6.1e).\nTable 6.2 - Size of the sensor for geometry 4.\nGeometry\tSpatial resolution SXxSY (mm)\tSpacing between transmitter and receiver (mm)\t\tFinger size, FXxFY(mm2)\n\t\tGAPX\tGAPY\t\nGeometry 4.1\t5.78 x 6.63\t0.86\t0.17\t0.17 x 6.12\nGeometry 4.2\t2.72 x 6.63\t0.425\t0.17\t0.17 x 6.12\nGeometry 4.3\t5.78 x 6.63\t0.86\t0.17\t0.17 x 0.68\nFigure 6.4 - Summary simulation results for sensors with geometry 4.\nLL Q_\n(D\nO\n\u00a3=\n05 -I\u2014*\nO\n05\nQ_\n05 O\n100\t200\t300\t400\t500\t600\t700\t800\t900\t1000\nFilm Thickness [gm]\nFigure 6.5 - Simulation results for sensors with geometry 4 where GAPX was increased.\nFigure 6.6 - Simulation results for sensors with geometry 4 where FY was increased.\nFigure 6.7 - Simulation results for sensor with geometry 5.\nAccording to these results, it is possible to conclude that (1) the capacitance is very small (between 0.02 pF and 17 pF) and its value can be enhanced by either changing the distance between the transmitter and receiver electrodes or increasing the effective sensing area, regardless of the concerned geometry. (2) Increasing the distance between the electrodes, the saturation film thickness grows, which is evident in Figure 6.3 and Figure 6.5. (3) Increasing the electrode size improves the measurement sensitivity of the sensor, Figure 6.2,Figure 6.3 and Figure 6.6.\nThe best design geometry to achieve a balance between the penetration depth, the sensitivity, the minimum spatial resolution (4 x 4 mm ) and the quasi-linear characteristic is the geometry 5, Figure 6.1e. The saturation thickness is higher than 2500 |im while for other geometries is maximum 700 |im.\n6.1.2\tTesting the Selected Sensor Geometry\nIn the section 6.1.1, the selected geometry was tested using an electrostatic FEM simulation in electrostatic conditions. Usually, the literature considers this approximation as valid for capacitive sensors (NASSR et al., 2008; MUKHOPADHYAY et al., 2005). But, this simulation does not consider the conductance and the frequency.\nAn electric current FEM simulation was carried out to study the selected sensor behavior in frequency domain. The simulation considers the electrostatic field, the electric currents and the frequency of operation. This simulation was made at frequency of 5 MHz, that it is the operation frequency of the capacitance measurement system. For this type of simulation, the solution is obtained by solving the following equations presented in section 2.7. The studied result was the admittance. The admittance for a measured pair Tx-Rx can be written as\nYs\tG j,\t(6.1)\nwhere is the simulated admittance, is the simulated conductance, is the simulated frequency (5 MHz) and is the simulated capacitance.\nFor the purpose of comparison, the capacitance and conductance were dimensionless as:\nC - C \u25a0\nCdl =Dimensionless Capacitance =-------\u2014\t(6.2)\nCmax Cmin\nwhere is the capacitance value,\tis the maximum capacitance value and is the\nminimum capacitance values.\nG \u2014 G\n(\u00a1\tDimensionless Conductance =--------\u2014\t(6.3)\nGmax Gmin\nwhere is the conductance value,\tis the maximum conductance value and is the\nminimum conductance value.\nThe comparison between the dimensionless capacitance and conductance for the sensor is shown in the Figure 6.8. The response is pretty much the same in both cases, including the nonlinear behavior and the lower and upper limits. Thus, the measurement of film thickness by\n107\nconductive or capacitive technique depends on the properties of the fluids and the conditions of the experiments. For example, the conductance can be used if the liquid film is conductive and the capacitance if the film liquid is non-conductive. The saturation thickness is near to 2200 gm.\nFigure 6.8 - Conductance and capacitance results using electric current simulations for resolution of 4x4 mm2.\nFigure 6.9 shows a comparison between the electrostatic and electric current simulations of the sensor. It is possible see that the dimensionless capacitance has a different behavior, for instance in the upper limit. For the electrostatic case the upper limit is 3000 gm, but it is only of 2200 gm for the electric current case. On the other hand, the lowers limits do not show a significant variation. The difference between the electrostatic and electric current simulations shows that it is important to consider the conductance and frequency to calculate the film thickness limits.\nFigure 6.9 - Capacitance results using electrostatics and electric current simulations for resolution of 4*4 mm .\n6.2\tExperimental Results\nAfter preliminary experiments using high-speed camera, it was established that the expected water film thickness would be between 400 pm and 2000 pm. The sensor with spatial resolution of 4 * 4 mm would be suitable for the measurement of these thicknesses, see section\n4.3.\tThe effective measuring area for this sensor is of 64 mm by 52 mm. The temporal resolution in all the experiments was 5000 frames per second.\n6.2.1\tCalibration\nIn order to correlate the signal obtained from the receiver electrodes to film thickness, a calibration was necessary prior to the measurements. During the calibration experiments, the sensor is immersed into water with an inclined angle and various cylinders with a known gap are rolled over the sensor. The measured value is the minimum measured value, when the cylinder is passing over the measuring point (Figure 6.10). Figure 6.11 shows the calibration elements; one can see the calibration box, where the sensor was fixed and maintained straight, and some of the cylinders used in the tests.\nThe experiments were made using eighteen cylinders made of polyvinyl chloride, PVC, with a relative permittivity of three (the similar to oil). The cylinders have gaps (6) between zero and 2400 pm, Figure 6.10. Each cylinder was rolled over the sensor ten times.\nFigure 6.10 - Cylinder with a gap of 6 micrometers.\nThe calibration value is taken from the minimum measured value, when the cylinder is passing over the measuring point. The calibration values for each measurement point are fitted with a fourth order rational polynomial.\nThe film thickness 6, in each measurement point, can be calculated as\nS = a]Udl + a2Udl + aUdl + a4Udl + a5 (6 4)\nwhere to are the polynomial coefficients determined by the calibration curve fitting and is calculated by eq. (4.4).\na)\tb)\nFigure 6.11 - Calibration elements. a) Calibration box and b) Sample of cylinders.\nFigure 6.12 presents the calibration results for each measurement point (each pair Tx-Rx).\nThese results show that the simulations results represent correctly the practical behavior (refer to Figure 6.9). In the same way, they confirm that it is possible to measure the water film thickness with the capacitance system.\nFigure 6.12 - Dimensionless voltage for each measurement point using the different cylinders.\n6.2.2\tUncertainty Analysis\nThree sources of errors were taken into account to determinate the uncertainty of the film thickness measurement system presented in this work. First, the measurement of the gap in the calibration cylinders (calibration error). Second, the deviation from the calibration curve. At last, the statistical variations of the measured values (data acquisition system error).\n6.2.2.1\tCalibration Error\nAs seen in the last section, the system calibration is made using a calibration cylinders. Each cylinder has a known gap and is passed over the sensor ten times. The voltage in every measuring point is recorded. The calibration values for each measurement point are fitted with a fourth order rational polynomial. There are two sources of error in this case, one due to the cylinder gap measurements and other due to the curve fitting.\nTo calculate the gap are measured the internal diameter of the cylinder (Dj) and the external diameter (of the rim), De.\nGap = D D\n2\n(6.5)\nA caliper, with an uncertainty of uCa t ip er =\u00b10.01 mm, is used to measure these diameters. Several measurements of the diameters of each cylinder were made, with the caliper, to estimate the standard uncertainty of the internal diameter and the external diameter measurements. The standard uncertainty for the internal diameter was uD ,s=\u00b10.025 mm and for the external diameter was uDes=\u00b10.022 mm. Combining the uncertainty of the caliper and the standard uncertainty, uD.=0.026 mm and uDg=0.024 mm.\nThe uncertainty of the calibration cylinder gaps can be estimated as\nUGap (Di ,De ) =\n' dGap\nu2\ndGap\n'dGap V dGap\n&lt;8Di JI\nA\nu D. u D r (D \u2019 De ).(6.6)\n^i\te\n+\nu2\n\nwhere r (Di,De) is the correlation coefficient and is -0.34. The uncertainty of the cylinder gap measurements is =\u00b10.020 mm.\nOn the other hand, the uncertainty due to the polynomial fitting process is the standard deviation of each coefficient in eq. (6.4). The standard deviation is given as an out parameter of the used Matlab function. An example of the uncertainty of the coefficients is (these are representative for the measurement system):\nu = 0.041 mm\na1\nu = 0.065 mm a2\nu = 0.032 mm\nu = 0.005 mm\na4\nu = 0.0002 mm\na5\n(6.7)\n6.2.2.2\tData Acquisition System Error\nIt was used the deviation of the measured voltages Ux for a measuring pair (Tx5-Rx5) to estimate the uncertainty of the measurement system due to random error. The sensor was covered with water with a film thickness higher than the saturation one, and 5000 frames were recorded at 5000 fps. The sine excitation had 5 V peak and 5MHz of frequency. The uncertainty of the data\nacquisition system was taken as the maximum value of deviation in the voltage measurements, u Ux = 4.7 mV, Figure 6.13.\nVZ[V]\nFigure 6.13 - Distribution of the voltage measurements for pair Tx5-Rx5 for 5000 frames with the sensor covered with water (on saturation condition).\n6.2.2.3\tFilm Thickness Measurement Uncertainty\nRemembering that the film thickness 6, in each measurement point, is calculated as\n~ aUdl + aUdl + a3^dl + aUdl + a5\nwhere to are the polynomial coefficients determined by the calibration process and is\nU = Ux dI\tUsat\nwhere is the measured voltage and is the measured voltage when the sensor is covered by water with a thickness higher than 2200 pm.\nThe uncertainty for can be calculated as\nUUdl (Ux -U -.t ) =\n0.0047 V\nU (Ux'\t) :\t2\nU sat\n(6.8)\nwhere\t.\ntxt\tSClt\nMoreover, the uncertainty for film thickness estimation, us, can be obtained by combining the uncertainty of the coefficients (section 6.2.2.1) and the U dt uncertainty:\nz\tTT X _\tV1 I\nUS (ai, a2,\ta5,U dl) \u2014\t/ ,\n<a.\nCombining the uncertainty of the calibration error and the film thickness estimation we have the uncertainty of the film thickness measurement system equal to\nUsystem = J(UGap\t+ (Us)2 \u2022\t(6.11)\nThus, the uncertainty of the film thickness measurement system for all the range in Figure 6.12, taking Tx5-Rx5 as reference, is\n\u00b185 urn &lt;ii^&lt;\u00b1105 pm. (6.12)\nThe first bound is related to water film thickness of 100 qm and the second is related to the larger measured film thickness (2200 qm).\nFor the experiments, in section 6.2.3, the measured film thickness was between 1000 qm and 2100 qm . For those limits, the uncertainty is\n\u00b1101 urn &lt;uSyStem&lt;\u00b1105 pm.\t(6.13)\n6.2.3\tPipe Flow Results\nOne of the main goals of this research is to assess the capability of a capacitive planarsensor system for measuring a thin water film thickness in oil-water flow. For these purpose, experimental points were selected based on the water and oil superficial velocities for upward-vertical pipe flow with special attention paid to semi-annular and fully dispersed oil-in-water flow patterns. Annular flow is characterized by an oil core surrounded by a water film. It can be rather unstable and drops of several different sizes and shapes can be observed around the oil core. At fully dispersed oil-in-water flow a water film adjacent to the pipe wall has been identified recently. In total, 44 oil-water experiments (33 annular and 11 dispersed) were carried out in a glass pipe with 50.8 mm of I.D, refer to Table A.1. The film thickness was recorded at\n5000 frames/second for one second by the capacitance measurement system and the high-speed\ncamera.\n6.2.3.1\tObserved Flow Patterns\nWater and oil flow rate ranges were 0.1 m/s to 2.0 m/s and 0.3 m/s to 0.8 m/s, respectively. It was possible to observe big drops, unstable or semi-annular flow and dispersed oil-in-water flow, Figure 6.14. In the next sections, big drops and unstable annular flow will be analyzed as a single pattern, because near to the pipe wall their behaviors are similar (oil drops and a water film). One can see in Figure 6.15 the observed flow patterns as function of oil superficial velocities and water superficial velocities. These experimental points were chosen such that the water film thickness could be measured with the capacitive system. The transition boundary between dispersed oil-in-water flow and unstable annular corresponds to the theoretical one\n(Figure 3.2).\now\n'\u25a0.$ 1-h\u2019\u00ab!\t\u2019\nFigure 6.14 - Observed flow patterns. a) Big drops, Vso =0.4 m/s and Vsw =0.2. b) Unstable\nannular flow, Vso =0.3742 m/s and Vsw =0.15. c) Unstable annular flow, Vso =0.3 m/s and Vsw\n=0.1 m/s. d) Dispersed oil-in-water, Vso =0.5 m/s and Vsw =1.5 m/s.\nVso [m/s]\n0.2\n0 1\n0 01\n0.3\n<Z!\nE\n\u00a3\nCZ)\n>\n0 3\t0 4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0 80.9 1\n1 0 9 0.8 0 7\n0.6\n0.5\nBig Drops\n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\nrnstable annular\n\u25a0\tUnstable Annular Flow\n\u25a0\tBig Drops\n\u25a0\tDispersed oil in Water Flow\nj i i i i i i i i\nDispersed oil in water\nFigure 6.15 - Observed flow patterns as function of oil superficial velocities and water superficial\nvelocities.\n6.2.3.2\tWater Film Thickness\nThe high-speed camera images were processed using the algorithms presented in Chapter 0. First of all, the images were pre-processed. After the pre-processing, the image size is 668 x 481 pixels. Next, the images were segmented using the proposed algorithm. One can see in Figure 6.16 an original snapshot, the resulting image after applying the pre-processing step and the result of the segmentation stage.\nThe mean film thickness was determined for each experiment by averaging 5000 frames of instantaneous film thickness measurements, in both high-speed-camera images and capacitive technique. The definitions of mean film thickness 6 for one frame is\nNP\n1\tNframes\ne - \u2014\nframes 1\n(6.15)\nwhere Nframes is 5000 frames.\na) b)\nc)\nFigure 6.16 - Image processing results. a) Original snapshot , Vso =0.8 m/s and Vsw =0.8 m/s\nexperiment. b) Pre-processing result. c) Segmentation result.\nThe measured mean film thickness obtained by the capacitance system for each experiment was compared with the one obtained by the high-speed-camera image technique, Figure 6.18 and Figure 6.19. The flow patterns unstable annular and big drops were analyzed as a unique pattern called unstable annular flow, as mentioned in section 6.2.3.1. The average relative error (ARE) considered to compare the system and camera measurements is:\ncamera\tsystem\nARE -100 1\t\u2018\t1 ,/],\nN\t(6.16)\nZ abs\nwhere dcamera and 6system denote the film thickness predicted by the high-speed camera images and that estimated by the proposed system, respectively. N is the number of experimental points. The average relative error (ARE) is 21.8% and the deviation is -30% for unstable annular flow and 3.6% and -10% for dispersed flow. The black triangles are the results of the measurement system, the red squares are the results of the high-speed camera images and the blue line denotes a -30% deviation having as reference the film thickness estimated using the images. The uncertainty of the measurements using the images was of 100 |im, corresponding to the half of the minimum scale of the square pattern used for calibration, see Figure 4.13. As one can see in Figure 6.18 and Figure 6.19, the water film thickness ranged from 900 |im to 2100 |im for the unstable-annular flow pattern and from 1300 |im to 2200 |im for dispersed flow, respectively. The image technique always overestimated the capacitance-system data, the disagreement being more pronounced for the unstable-annular-flow case.\nThe capacitive measurement system is able to record the water film thickness in different directions. It allows having information about 3-D variations, so one should expect that the average film thickness would be overestimated in comparison with the image-analysis-based technique, which only records 2-D projection of the film. However, the opposite is observed. This is an indication that the proposed image-analysis-based technique may be overestimating the value of the water film thickness maybe due to segmentation errors, i.e. some oil-drop pixels, with gray values near to water, could have been segmented as water (refer also to Figure 5.20).\nThe lower computed error for dispersed flow could be because in this kind of flow the oil droplets are uniformly distributed in the perimetral and axial directions near the tube wall. This fact was confirmed by visual inspection (Figure 6.14d). Otherwise, for unstable-annular flow the difference between capacitive and image-based data is larger, between 20% and 35%. Oil drops are elongated in the axial direction and tend to coalesce, while in the perimetral direction larger distances between them were visually observed (Figure 6.17 and Figure 6.14a). Distortions related to problems about keeping the focus of the camera on the diametrical-vertical plane may have become more pronounced in this flow situation. Optical distortions are probably the reason behind the observed disagreement.\nFigure 6.17 - Illustration of the unstable annular flow.\nFigure 6.18 - Measured water film thickness using capacitance system versus measured by highspeed-camera image technique for unstable-annular flow.\n2400'\tARE=3.6%\n2200\nw w&lt;D c\no\n2000\n1800\n1600\no w c&lt;D W\n1400\n1200\nE\nE\n1000\n\u25a1\nA Sensor \u25a1 Images\n-10%\n800 L-------C--------C-------C-------C--------C--------C-------J\n1200\t1400\t1600\t1800\t2000\t2200\t2400\t2600\nCamera Film Thickness [^m]\nFigure 6.19 - Measured water film thickness using capacitance system versus measured by highspeed camera images for dispersed oil-in-water flow.\nThe liquid-film thickness is plotted against oil volume fraction for both flow patterns in Figure 6.20. The oil fractions below /io=0.45 correspond to dispersed flow and above /io=0.48 correspond to unstable annular flow. The general trend of the liquid film thickness is to decrease as the oil fraction increases, for all unstable annular flow. For dispersed flow, there is the same trend for oil fractions between 0.16 and 0.4. An explanation is that as the oil volumetric fraction increases, the oil tends to take over the entire cross-section.\nThe dimensionless water-film thickness is plotted against the water-film Reynolds number in Figure 6.21. Rodriguez et al. (2012) presented the dimensionless water-film thickness, Fi 1 m Thi ckn e s s (8)/ 8 sub m, where the water-film thickness is normalized by the thickness of an effective viscous sublayer of a turbulent homogeneous mixture of oil in water. The latter is given by\nfrict ,m\n5\n.\t(6.17)\nII)\nwhere\tis the mixture friction velocity,\nm\nx 1/2\n(6.18)\n\nwhere tw is the shear stress at the wall defined as\nT\nw\n' R '\t''dp '\ni 2 ,\t)\nm\n(6.19)\nThe water-film Reynolds number is given by:\nRe f ~\np\tf (2d)\nPw\n(6.20)\nand Vwj = Vo / 2 is the water-film velocity.\nThe explanation given in Rodriguez et al. (2012) for the drag reduction phenomenon was the existence of a thin laminar water film near the pipe wall. A linear relation between the dimensionless water-film thickness and water-film Reynolds number was found and transition from laminar to turbulent film flow was related to lower or even no drag reduction. One can see in Figure 6.21 that a linear fitting could approximate the relation obtained in this work for dispersed flow, but the film-Reynolds number is quite high, in between 2500 and 5750. According to that model, the water-film flow is likely to be in the turbulent regime. Perhaps it is interesting to inform that some preliminary pressure-drop tests were conducted during this work and no drag reduction was detected.\nE\ncn tn\nCD c\no\n500\n2000\n1500\n1000\nc\to\tGO O\t\t\t\no \u00b0(\u00a7\t\tG\t\t\t-\no\t\tG\t\u25a1\u25a1\t\t\n\u00b0C\t\tZ\t\u25a1\t\t\n-\tG\t\t\t\t\t-\n\t\tG\t\u25a1 c\t\t\n\t\t\tz\t\t\n\t\t\t^z \u25a1\t\t\n-\t\t\tz\t\t-\n\t\t\tz z\t\t\n\u25a1 Film thickness\t\t- Unstable Annular Flow [pm]\t\t\t\n\u00b0 Film thickness\t\t- Dispersed Flow [pm]\t\tr\t\n0\n0.2\n0.8\n1\nE\n0.4\t0.6\nho I\u2019!\nFigure 6.20 - Measured water film thickness using capacitance system against oil fraction.\nE\nE\n_Q\n25\n(/)\nCO\n(/)\n(0 CD\nC\no\n180\t:\u25a0\tL\tL\tL\tL\tL\tL\tL\t\u25a0\t\t\t\t\t\t\n160\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n140\t-\t\t\t* *\u25a0\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n120\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n100\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n80\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t-\n60\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t-\n40\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t-\n20\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t-\n0 t,-------r---------r---------r---------c--------r---------r---------r------J:\n2000\t2500\t3000\t3500\t4000\t4500\t5000\t5500\t6000\nRef [-]\nFigure 6.21 - Dimensionless water-film thickness against the water-film Reynolds number for\ndispersed oil-in-water flow.\n6.2.3.3\tHoldup\nFigure 6.22 presents the comparison between the water holdup from the quick-closing valves (QCV), and the water holdup obtained by the homogeneous model, for the unstable annular and dispersed flow patterns. The water holdup predicted by the homogeneous model shows a deviation of about -30% compared to the QCV value, and the average relative error is 20.1%. The black line denotes the ideal agreement and the green one the deviation. The values predicted by the model are lower than the values obtained experimentally, which shows the presence of slip between the phases, with oil flowing faster than water. One can see that for dispersed flow the homogeneous model has a significantly lower error (5.1%) than for unstable annular flow, which is consistent as no-slip between phases is expected in fully dispersed flow.\nThe water-holdup data obtained by the quick close valves are compared with predictions of the correlation for core-annular flow of Rodriguez et al. (2009), which considers the presence of interfacial waves , turbulent water flow, the presence of dispersed oil droplets and slip between the phases. The predicted water holdup shows a deviation of about +20% compared to the QCV value and the average relative error is 10.1%, Figure 6.23. The agreement between holdup predictions and measurements is better for the entire experimental range in general. However, the correlation of Rodriguez et al. (2009) is valid for core-annular flow only and, in principle, should not be applied to dispersed flow. As expected, the agreement is worse for dispersed flow, in comparison with that observed in Figure 6.23. The higher the water holdup, the worse the disagreement.\nIn conclusion, as far as the typical oil-water flow studied in this work is concerned, the homogenous model should be used for predicting the water holdup in the dispersed oil-in-water flow (Figure 6.22) and the correlation of Rodriguez et al. (2009) should be used for prediction the water holdup in the unstable-annular flow (Figure 6.23).\nFigure 6.22 - Water holdup according to the Homogeneous Model against the water holdup\nobtained from QCV.\n0 -\t--\n0\t0.1\t0.2\t0.3\t0.4\t0.5\t0.6\t0.7\t0.8\t0.9\t1\nWater Holdup by QCV [-]\nFigure 6.23 - Water holdup according to the correlation proposed by Rodriguez et al. (2009) against the water holdup obtained from QCV.\nComparision with capacitance system data\nThe data obtained with the capacitance system was used to estimate the oil holdup. It is assumed that the statistically axisymmetric oil core can be treated as a side view of a solid body of revolution and its volume is calculated using the disk method. Figure 6.24 presents a sketch of an ideal axisymmetric core-annular flow.\nFigure 6.24 - Ideal core-annular flow sketch.\nThe capacitance system measures the water film thickness in each measurement point (pair Tx-Rx), Figure 6.25. The oil radius (rOij) in each measure point is estimated as\nr = r \u2014 3\no\u2018j\t(6.21)\nwhere r is the pipe diameter and is the measured water film thickness in a pair Tx-Rx(i,j). The subscripts i and j indicate position in the axial direction (Txs direction) and in the perimetral position (Rxs direction).\nA polynomial fitting is used to obtain in the axial direction (flow direction), for each reception line (there are 16 reception lines, i.e. j varies between 1 and 16). Thus,\n*4\t*3\t*2\t*\t*\nr (x) = axx + a2x + a3x + a4x + a5\t(6.22)\nThe volume is calculated as\nL\nVolo = Lt/;'( x)dx\n0\t(6.23)\nand finally, the oil holdup calculation is as\n\nVolOj\nVolT\n(6.24)\nwhere VolT = nr2L is the pipe volume, L is a defined pipe length and r is the pipe radius.\nThe average holdup is obtained by\n16\n(6.25)\nFigure 6.25 - Example of data interpolated to obtain the oil radius.\nComparisons between the oil holdup calculated using the capacitance system data and the oil holdup measure by the quick-closing-valve method are presented in Figure 6.26 and Figure 6.27 for unstable annular flow and oil-in-water dispersed flow, respectively. For unstable-annular flow, the oil holdup calculated from the capacitance system data has a relatively low error (ARE is 15.2%), but the trend indicates a high qualitative error (Figure 6.26). It systematically overestimates the oil holdup measured by the quick-closing-valves method, which is probably because the capacitive system could not detect water volumes trapped in between drops at the pipe core. On the other hand, the error is much higher for dispersed flow (ARE is 61.3%). This\nresult was expected since there is a water-oil mixture in the center of the pipe and not only oil (Figure 6.27). In conclusion, this technique could be a possibility for a stable core-annular flow; perhaps if there is insignificant dispersion of oil droplets. However, the technique is definitely not recommended for the typical dispersed oil-in-water flow studied in this work.\nFigure 6.26 - Oil holdup using the capacitance system data against the oil holdup obtained from QCV for unstable annular flow experiments.\nQ_\n3\no\nI\n6\n<D\n> \u25a0-W\nO ro\no. ro O\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n\u25a1 Experimental for dispersed\n-----Ideal\n1\n0-\n0\nr r\n0.6\t0.8\n1\nOil Holdup by QCV [-]\nFigure 6.27 - Oil holdup using the capacitance system data against the oil holdup obtained from QCV for dispersed flow experiments.\n6.3\tWater-Film Topology\nThe characterization of the water-film topology is presented in this section. A narrow strips near the pipe wall clearly dominated by water were observed in this work and its characteristic average thickness, 6, has been measured. However, the observed water-film region is not a region completely free from oil drops. An oil drop may have been seen near the pipe wall eventually, but it was always repelled towards the dispersed core. It is adopted the pragmatic assumption that there is a water film, with a characteristic space and time-averaged thickness. The characterization includes collecting geometrical and kinematic parameters of an interfacial structure, which separates the wall region, dominated by water, from the core region, dominated by mixture of oil in water.\n6.3.1\tPreliminary Definitions\nSome definitions for waves are used for the interfacial structure description. One can see in Figure 6.28 an artistic illustration of a typical image obtained from the high-speed camera in upward-vertical flow.\n\u2022\tFilm thickness (<5) is the distance between the pipe wall and the oil-water interface in a determined point.\n\u2022\tCrest is the highest point of the film thickness.\n\u2022\tTrough is the lowest point of the film thickness.\n\u2022\tWavelength (A) is the distance between successive crests or troughs and it is related to the axial size and distance of the oil drops. The average wavelength can be obtained as:\n_\t1 nw-1\nk =------7 E^,\t(6.26)\nnw -1 1=1 j\nwhere nw is the number of crests identified in time and Ay is the j-th wavelength in the frame (CASTRO et al., 2012).\n\u2022\tAmplitude (A) is the difference between the crest and its neighboring trough and it is related to perimetral size of the oil drops near to the pipe wall. The average amplitude can be calculated from the amplitude relative to the previous through and relative to the posterior through :\nA\nmil\n2\n(6.27)\n\u2022 Velocity is the ratio between the distance traveled by a crest between two known points and the correspondent elapsed time (BANNWART, 1998).\nWater film thickness\nWater\nFlow direction\nPipe Wall\nj______Pipe center\nI\n\u25a0\nFigure 6.28 - Longitudinal section through of an interfacial structure in upward-vertical flow.\nIn Figure 6.30 and Figure 6.31, film thickness results of four experiments are presented; capacitive-system data for unstable-annular flow at the left-hand side and for dispersed flow at the right-hand side. Distributions of the water-film thickness are shown. In Figure 6.30a and Figure 6.31a, areas with large changes in film thickness are observed for unstable annular flow, whereas a more uniform water-film-thickness distribution is seen for dispersed flow (Figure 6.30d and Figure 6.31d). Zero-micrometer film thickness is represented by white color and intense blue refers to 2200 pm. It was possible to recognize similar behaviors in experiments with the same flow pattern. Unstable-annular flow can be described by big fluctuations in both the flow direction (axial) and perimeter direction, big interfacial structures and distributions (all the measurement points) with non-uniform regions. On the other hand, oil-in-water dispersed\nThe axial water-film thickness distribution over a line of Tx for a constant Rx in a given instant of time (refer also to Figure 6.29, green line) is showed in Figure 6.30b (unstable-annular flow) and e (dispersed flow) and Figure 6.31b (unstable-annular flow) and e (dispersed flow). Higher and more intense fluctuations are observed in the case of unstable-annular flow (Figure 6.30b and Figure 6.31b) than in dispersed flow (Figure 6.30e and Figure 6.31e).\nThe perimetral water-film distribution over a perimeter Rx for a constant Tx in a given instant of time (refer also to Figure 6.29, red line) is showed in in Figure 6.30c (unstable-annular flow) and f (dispersed flow) and Figure 6.31c (unstable-annular flow) and f (dispersed flow). The film thickness has strong oscillations in unstable-annular flow (Figure 6.30c and Figure 6.31c), slightly stronger than those seen in the axial distribution. The signals are much softer in dispersed flow, and almost no difference can be inferred when comparing the data in the axial or perimetral directions (Figure 6.30f and Figure 6.31f).\nFigure 6.29 - Film thickness for all the Tx and one Rx in green (along the pipe) and film thickness for all the Rx and one Tx in red (pipe perimeter).\na)\nd)\nFilm thickness [um]\tFilm thickness [im]\n2400\n2200\n2000\n1800\n'e\u2019 1600\n1400\no\n1200\no\n1000\nE\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n4\t8\t12\t16\t20\t24\t28 32\t36\t40\t44\t48\t52\n2400\n2200\n2000\n1800\n1600\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n4\t8\t12\t16\t20\t24\t28\t32\t36\t40\t44\t48\t52\nPipe position [mm]\nb)\n2400\n2200\n2000\n1800\n1600\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n-80\t-60\t-40\t-20\t0\t20\t40\t60\t80\nPipe position [mm]\ne)\n2400:----c----1----1-----c----c-----c----t----\n2200 -\t-\n2000 -\t-\n1800 -\tV\u2014\u20144\u20144\u20144\u20144\u20144\u2014-\n'E\u2019 1600 -\t-\n4\n$ 1400 -\t-\n<D\n1200 -\t-\no\n\u00a3 1000-\t-\nE\n\u00a1Z 800 -\t-\n600 -\t-\n400 -\t-\n200 -\t-\n0\u2018----1----1----1-----1----1----1-----1----\n-80\t-60\t-40\t-20\t0\t20\t40\t60\t80\nAngle [\u00b0]\nAngle [\u00b0]\nc)\tf)\nFigure 6.30 - Measurements obtained with the capacitive system for unstable annular flow (left\nimages) at Vsw =0.1 m/s and Vso =0.3 m/s and dispersed flow (right images) at Vsw=1.5 m/s and\nVso =0.8 m/s. a) and d) Snapshot image; b) and e) film thickness for all the Tx and one Rx (along\nthe pipe); c) and f) film thickness for all the Rx and one Tx (pipe perimeter).\n131\na)\nd)\nFilm thickness [im]\tFilm thickness [im]\n2400\n2200 -\nPipe position [mm]\nb)\n2000 -\n1800 -\n1600 -\n1400 -\n1200 -\n1000 -\n800 -\n600 -\n400 -\n200 -\n0\n-80\t-60\t-40\t-20\t0\t20\t40\t60\t80\nAngle [\u00b0]\n2400\n2200\n2000\n1800\n1600\n$ 1400\no\n1200\no\n1000\nE\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n4\t8\t12\t16\t20\t24\t28\t32\t36\t40\t44\t48\t52\nPipe position [mm]\ne)\n2400\n2200\n2000\n1800\nS\u2019 1600\n1400\no\n1200\no\n1000\nE\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n-80\t-60\t-40\t-20\t0\t20\t40\t60\t80\nAngle [\u00b0]\nf)\nc)\nFigure 6.31 - Measurements obtained with the capacitive system for unstable annular flow (left\nimages) at Vsw =0.15 m/s and Vso =0.4 m/s and dispersed flow (right images) at Vsw=1.7 m/s and\nVso =0.6 m/s. a) and d) Snapshot image; b) and e) film thickness for all the Tx and one Rx (along\nthe pipe); c) and f) film thickness for all the Rx and one Tx (pipe perimeter).\nSnapshots taken with the high-speed camera synchronized with data from the capacitive-measurement system are presented in Figure 6.32 and Figure 6.33. In this figure, a film thickness with zero value means oil touching the tube wall. Figure 6.32 and Figure 6.33a correspond to unstable annular flow at two different flow rates and Figure 6.33b and c to dispersed flow. An advantage of the capacitive system is that it delivers 3-D representation of the water-film topology, instead of simple 2-D projections.\nThere are intense fluctuations in unstable-annular flow along the flow direction (axial) as well as on the perimeter direction (Figure 6.32). Nevertheless, the fluctuations along the flow direction are less intense than over the perimeter direction. An explanation is the shape of the oil drops. They are not spherical, but rather oval and oriented in the flow direction, as mentioned in section 6.2.3.2. The dynamics of the water flow (preponderant shear stress in the flow direction) and interaction between droplets (viscous wake) are responsible for stretching the oil drops in the flow direction. The bigger the drops, the stronger the drop-stretching phenomenon, as interfacialtension forces, which act to keep the drops spherical, become less important.\nThe fluctuations in dispersed flow are less intense and similar in both directions (Figure 6.32). The observed uniformity in the water-film-thickness fluctuations can be explained by the existence of more spherical droplets; the smaller the drops, the stronger the interfacial-tension forces that try to keep them spherical. Therefore, a similar distribution of fluctuations is expected, regardless the direction, axial or perimetral.\nFigure 6.32 - Comparision of high-speed camera images with measured film thickness in 3D for unstable annular flow with Vsw =0.1 m/s and Vso =0.35 m/s.\na)\nb)\nc)\nFigure 6.33- Comparision of high-speed camera images with measured film thickness in 3D. a)\nUnstable annular flow with Vsw =0.2 m/s and Vso =0.75 m/s; b) dispersed flow with Vsw =1.2 m/s\nand Vso =0.8 m/s and c) dispersed flow with Vsw =1.3 m/s and Vso =0.5 m/s.\n6.3.2\tData Treatment\n6.3.2.1\tCapacitance Measurement System\nIn this work, each measuring point of the capacitive sensor was studied separately. The amplitudes and velocities were measured in the time domain. The interfacial frequency was determined in the frequency domain. Finally, wavelength was calculated using the velocities and frequencies.\nOne can see in Figure 6.34 the time signal of a given measuring point during 0.02 (100 samples) for two experiments in unstable-annular flow (left side) and two experiments in\ndispersed flow (right side). The signals in unstable-annular flow have larger amplitudes (up to\n1600 qm), while the dispersed one have smaller amplitudes (400 qm), refer to Table A.2.\ntime [s]\ttime [s]\na)\tb)\nFigure 6.34 - Measurments at a given measurig point as a function of time for four expriments. a)\nUnstable annular flow, in blue Vsw =0.15 m/s and Vso =0.37 m/s, in red Vsw =0.15 m/s and Vso\n=0.4 m/s. b) Dispersed fow, in blue Vsw =1.96 m/s and Vso =0.5 m/s, in red Vsw =1.96 m/s and Vso =0.6 m/s.\nThe velocity was calculated using the technique of cross-correlation. Notice that the velocity data may be, in fact, correlated to the average velocity of the interfacial structures that flow near the pipe wall, which are drops in unstable-annular flow or droplets in dispersed flow.\nThe cross correlation technique is a popular method to measure velocity in several fields, including in multiphase flows. Usually, two separated sensors are used and they measure an electrical property of the flow, such as its resistance or capacitance (LUCAS &amp; JIN, 2001a;\n2001b; TAN &amp; DONG, 2010; ZANGL et al., 2009). Considering two pairs of identical sensors separated by a known distance along a pipe axis, as a disturbance passes through the sensor there is a change in its output signal. The disturbance is carried with the flow from the first sensor to the second one, causing a similar but not identical change in the output signal. The time delay between these changes in the output signal is equal to the time taken by the particle to travel the distance between the sensors. This is inversely proportional to the mean flow velocity.\nThe cross-correlation is defined as\nRRxy (de, O = Jim1J x(t - v)y(t) dt,\t(6.28)\nT 0\nwhere and are the two sensor signals, and\t) is the delayed version of signal\nx( t). T is the averaging time/sampling period over which the signal is correlated. The delay is calculated as the lag for which the correlation function RRxy is maximized. To calculate the time for the structure to pass between the two sensors, the lag is multiplied by the sampling rate. Thus, velocity of the interfacial structure is\nElectrodes distance de _ 4 x10-3\nr i Sensor\nDelay\tt Lag / f\n(6.29)\nwith fs=5000 frames per second.\nFigure 6.35 shows signals obtained at two consecutive measuring points.

The velocity is 1.17 m/s.\na)\nFigure 6.35 - Example of time delay and cross-correlation between two consecutive measuring\nLag\nb)\npoints with separation of 4 mm. a) Signals of pair Tx=1 and Rx=6 and pair Tx=2 and Rx=6; b) Cross-correlation result.\n136\nThe interfacial structure frequency was obtained using spectral analysis on the time signals. The analysis was made dividing the signals in five parts of 1000 samples (0.2 s) and calculating the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to every fragment. The FFT provides a spectrum with a range between 0 Hz to half the sampling rate. The frequency resolution is the sampling frequency divided by the number of points. Our sampling frequency is 5 kHz and according to the Nyquist criteria, the largest frequency contained in the signal must be less than 2.5 kHz to avoid aliasing. The frequency resolution is 5 Hz. Signals were studied using dominant frequency analysis. The dominant frequency is the frequency of the component with highest amplitude. The resulting amplitude spectrum for unstable annular flow and dispersed flow experiments are presented in Figure 6.36; the dominant frequencies are 24 Hz and 160 Hz, respectively. It was expected that the dominant frequency would be higher for dispersed flow. The interfacial structures near the pipe wall are smaller (droplets) and the mixture velocity is significantly higher in dispersed flow.\nThe dominant frequency and velocity can be used to obtain the average wavelength. One should expect that the wavelength (\t) is proportional to the droplet size. However, this\ninformation is restricted to the region near the pipe wall. Therefore, a method based on this technique to obtain average droplet size would be more suitable for fully dispersed flow, where a uniform distribution of droplets over the cross-sectional area is usually observed. The average wavelength of the signals can be obtained by\t, where\tis the\nvelocity and is the dominant frequency.\nFigure 6.36 - Amplitude spectrum for two experiments. a) Unstable annular flow, Vsw =0.1 m/s and Vso =0.35 m/s and b) dispersed flow, Vsw =1.2 m/s and Vso =0.8 m/s.\n6.3.2.2\tHigh Speed Camera Images\nThe oil drops velocity and the distance between them (called wavelength in the section 6.3.2.1) near to the pipe wall were measured manually from four high speed camera images for each experiment.

If the interfacial structure was a kinematic wave, the velocity should have been in between the in-situ velocities of oil and water (WALLIS, 1969). However, the velocity values were always below those of oil and water.\nThe reader can see that there is a good agreement between the in-situ water velocity and the measured interfacial structure velocity below Vm = 0.8 m/s (Figure 6.37). For velocities higher than 0.8 m/s, it is possible to see that there is a significant disagreement (Figure 6.37 and Figure 6.38). Instead of a wave that would move in the flow direction, the sensor is actually measuring the velocity of the drops that may develop quite complex trajectories towards and away from the pipe wall, deform and rotate. In addition, the flow behavior near of the pipe wall is not equal to that at the core. For example, in unstable-annular flow the oil drops coalesce creating a continuous structure in the core of the pipe, while near to the pipe wall there are dispersed drops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL\nI\tL\tI\tL\nVJm/s] - Unstable annular\nVw [m/s]\nVo [m/s]\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\no\n\u25a1\n1.1\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.1\t0.2\t0.3\t0.4\t0.5\t0.6\t0.7\t0.8\t0.9\t1\t1.1\nV [m/s]\nm\nFigure 6.37 - Measured velocity compared with in-situ water and oil velocities and mixture velocity for unstable annular flow.\nThe interfacial velocity is clearly lower than those of water and oil in dispersed flow (Figure 6.38). As far as the classic parabolic velocity profile is concerned, the local water velocity near the pipe wall is expected to be lower than the average velocity. Therefore, the droplet velocity near the wall should present a velocity significantly lower than the average water velocity (Vw), which is confirmed by the experiments (Figure 6.38).\nI\n2.5\nw\nE,\n>\n1.5\nL________I________L\nV^m/s] - Dispersed\nVw [m/s]\n\u25a1 Vo [m/s]\nL\tL\n\tz\tz\tz\nz\t\t\t\nz\to\tc\tG\ne\t\t\t\n1\n1.4\n\t\t\t\t\t\nZ Z C J\tZ\t\tG 0\t\t\n\to\tc\t\t\t\n1.6\t\t1.8\t2\t2.2\t2.4\t2.6\n2.8\t3\n2\nV [m/s]\nm\nFigure 6.38 - Measured velocity compared with in-situ water and oil velocities and mixture velocity for dispersed flow.\nThe velocity was also compared with the velocity obtained by the images, Figure 6.39 and Figure 6.40. For unstable annular flow, the agreement between the data is regular, with an ARE=31.4%. It is possible to see a big dispersion, Figure 6.39. For dispersed flow (Figure 6.40), the ARE is 33.2%. The velocity obtained by the measurement system, for mixture velocities lower than 2 m/s, has a good agreement. For higher values, the dispersion is higher but the trend is the same.\n1 \u25a0\tARE=31.4%\nVi Sensor [m/s]\nViImages[m/s]\n0.8\nin\n1\n>\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\nFigure 6.39\nin\n>\n0\n*\n*\u25a0\n0\n0 L-------r--------r--------T-------r--------r--------r-------l\n0.3\t0.4\t0.5\t0.6\t0.7\t0.8\t0.9\t1\nV [m/s] m\nL\n1.1\nEstimated velocity by system measurements and by images against mixture velocity for unstable annular flow.\n2.5\nL\tI\n- Vi Sensor [m/s]\nViImages[m/s]\nARE=33.2%\n1.5 -\n2 -\n1\n1.4\n0\n0\n\n\na\n0\n0 0\n0\n4?\n4?\n4-\nt t t t t L\n2\t2.2\t2.4\t2.6\t2.8\t3\nV [m/s]\nm\nFigure 6.40\nEstimated velocity by system measurements and by images against mixture velocity for dispersed flow.\nAnother comparison is between the wavelengths measured with the sensor and those extracted from the recorded images for unstable annular flow, Figure 6.41. The error was ARE = 36.6%. The wavelength is between 4 mm and 13mm, according to the image data, and between 4 mm and 16mm, according to the capacitance system. This is in qualitative accordance with the relatively big drops observed in unstable-annular flow.\nFor the dispersed flows, Figure 6.42, the agreement is better, the error is ARE = 18.3%. Thus, the capacitance system technique was able to predict the wavelength. The measured wavelength is between 1 mm and 5 mm. As discussed before, the wavelength data may be related to the size of the oil droplets, as it represents the average distance between droplets. Rodriguez (2014) determined theoretically the average diameter of droplets for similar experimental conditions. The results of Rodriguez (2014) show a good correspondence with the present wavelength data (Figure 6.42). For instance, the diameter decreases with increasing the mixture velocity and the diameters are between 1.6 mm and 3.3 mm for Vm = 2.5 m/s and Vm =1.3 m/s, respectively.\n\tCensor [mm]\n0\t^Images[mm]\n\n0\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n0\t\t\t\t\t\t\n0\t0\t\t0\t\t\t\n0\t-fc\t0\t\t\t\t0-\n0 o-\t00\t0\to.\t\u20ac *\u25a0 t\t0\t0\n-o\t\t0\t0\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t*\t\t\nE E.\n<<\n20\n18\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\t0.2\t0.4\t0.6\t0.8\t1\t1.2\nV\nm\n[m/s]\nFigure 6.41 - Estimated wavelength by system measurements and by images against mixture\nvelocity for unstable annular flow.\nL\n.4\nARE=18.3%\nL\n1.6\nL\n1.8\n4-\n4r\n4-\n:l\n2.2\t2.4\nV [m/s]\nm\n*\tXSensor [mm]\n0\tX.\t[mm]\nImages L\tJ\n4-\nL\n2.6\nL\n2.8\nJL\n3\nl\nv\nv\nv\n\nv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\nJL\n2\n6\n5.5\n5\n4.5\n4\n3.5\nE,\n3\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n1\nFigure 6.42 - Estimated wavelength by system measurements and by images against mixture velocity for dispersed flow.\nThe velocity was also compared with some experimental correlations developed for coreannular flow found in the literature, Table 6.3. These correlations were based on measurements made by high-speed camera images with the constraint of having only information about the focused plane or planes (2-D information only).The comparison is shown in Figure 6.43for unstable-annular flow. It is possible to observe that the velocities obtained from the sensor are closer to the model proposed by Rodriguez &amp; Bannwart (2006).

The interfacial structure velocity obtained in this study has a relatively good agreement with the predictions of the correlation of Rodriguez &amp; 144\nBannwart (2006) for interfacial wave in unstable-annular flow. That correlation was obtained for a core-annular flow with interfacial waves, dispersed drops and a turbulent water flow. The collected velocity actually describes the average velocity of drops flowing near the pipe wall. A possible explanation for the agreement is that the unstable-annular flow observed in this work possesses some dynamic similitude with the core-annular flow studied by Rodriguez &amp; Bannwart (2006). Finally, the wavelength obtained by the sensor has a relatively good agreement with that obtained via image analysis, especially for dispersed flow, but the latter systematically overestimates the former.\nTable 6.4 - Average relative error for wavelength, wavelength/amplitude and velocity\nFlow Pattern\tARE Wavelength Sensor-Images (%)\tARE Velocity SensorImages (%)\tARE Velocity Sensor-Bannwart (1998) Correlation (%)\tARE Velocity Sensor- Rodriguez &amp; Bannwart (2009) Correlation (%)\nUnstable Annular\t36.3\t31.4\t48\t33\nDispersed\t18.3\t33.2\t-\t-\nEmpirical correlations between the velocity obtained by the capacitance-measurement system and Froude number (Fr = Vm/^ gD) are shown in Figure 6.44 and Figure 6.45.

In fully dispersed flow (Figure 6.45), the correlation could be extrapolated to estimate the average velocity of droplets, since a nearly uniform cross-sectional droplet distribution is expected in this type of two-phase flow.\nTable 6.5 - Correlations for interfacial-structure velocity in unstable annular and dispersed flow\nFlow Pattern\tCorrelation\tR2\tARE (%)\nUnstable Annular\tV =-0.23Fr2 + 0.91Fr - 0.17\t0.81\t19.8\nDispersed\tV = 0.032Fr2 + 0.3Fr + 0.39\t0.88\t16.7\nFigure 6.44 - Correlation between measured velocity by the capacitance measurement system and the Froude number for unstable annular flow.\nin\n~E\n>\n2.4\n2.2\n2\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0.8\nc 1 1 .

There is only few water-film thickness measurement methods specifically developed for oil-water flow; it is shown that there is still need for further developments in this field.\nThe methods based on conductive or capacitive measurements and planar sensor are promising solutions to measure water film thickness in oil-water flows. They are more appropriate for oil-water flows because this system is able to measure the water film thickness in spite of oil sticking to the sensor surface.\nImage-analysis technique\nAn image-based methodology has been developed and applied for studying the near-wall flow in order to detect the presence and measure the thickness of a water film in oil-water flow in pipes.\nA combined method is proposed for image processing of the typical two-phase flow under study in this work, which is based on the systematic combination of different methods for preprocessing and segmentation of the images. The pre-processing comprises wavelet denoising, Unsharp filtering and contrast enhancement. The proposed methodology for segmentation is a combination of the following methods: wavelet decomposition, fuzzy partition and Tsallis entropy based thresholding, with three thresholds conversion to binary using the histogram, and morphological opening. The combined method performed significantly better when compared to the results obtained with traditional techniques applied individually.\nPlanar capacitive measurement system\nA non-invasive and non-intrusive water film thickness measurement system based on capacitance measurements for high-viscosity-oil-in-water flow was presented. The system was used to study thin water films in unstable-annular flow and oil-in-water dispersed flow in a 12 m long vertical glass pipe, with 50.8 mm of inner diameter. The experiments were carried out at different water and oil superficial velocities (0.1 to 2.0 m/s and 0.3 to 0.8 m/s, respectively). These experimental points were chosen such that the water film thickness could be measured with the capacitive system.\nIt was verified that the expected water film thickness would be between 400 micrometers and 2000 micrometers, after preliminary experiments using high-speed camera. A planar sensor with spatial resolution of 4 x 4 mm2 was chosen for the measurement after the analysis of the numerical simulations. The effective measuring area for the sensor with 4 x 4 mm2 spatial resolution is of 64 mm by 52 mm. The temporal resolution in all the experiments was 5000 frames per second.\nWater-film thickness\nThe water film thickness ranged from 900 pm to 2100 pm for the unstable-annular flow pattern and from 1300 pm to 2200 pm for dispersed flow, respectively. The average film thickness obtained by the capacitance system was compared with the one obtained by the imagebased technique. It was found a relatively good agreement between the two techniques, the average relative error for unstable-annular flow was 21.8% and 3.6% for dispersed flow. The value estimated by the images was always higher than the one measured with the capacitance system. The explanations are: (1) the capacitive measurement system is able to record tridimensional fluctuations, but the image-based technique only record 2-D information, (2) distortions related to problems about keeping the focus of the camera on the diametrical-vertical plane and 3) image segmentation errors.\nHoldup\nThe measured water holdup using QCV was compared with predictions of the homogeneous model and a correlation for core-annular flow. It was found that the homogenous model should be used for predicting the water holdup in dispersed oil-in-water flow and the correlation of Rodriguez et al. (2009) should be used for predicting the water holdup in unstableannular flow.\nThe measured oil holdup using QCV was also compared with the results of a proposed methodology using the capacitance system data. The approximation considers that the oil is flowing in the center of the pipe surrounded by a water film. This technique could be a possibility for a stable core-annular flow; perhaps if there is insignificant dispersion of oil droplets. However, the technique is definitely not recommended for the typical dispersed oil-in-water flow studied in this work.\nWater-film topology\nThe mean film thickness for all the measurement points, the instantaneous film thickness in an axial line and the instantaneous film thickness a perimetral line were studied. Unstable-annular flow can be described by big fluctuations in both the flow direction (axial) and perimeter direction, big interfacial structures and non-uniform distributions (all the measurement points). On the other hand, in oil-in-water dispersed flow fewer fluctuations were spotted in both the flow direction and perimeter direction, smaller interfacial structures and more uniform water-film-thickness distributions.\nThere are intense fluctuations in unstable-annular flow along the flow direction (axial) as well as on the perimeter direction. Nevertheless, the fluctuations along the flow direction are less intense than over the perimeter direction. An explanation is the shape of the oil drops. They are not spherical, but rather oval and oriented in the flow direction. The dynamics of the water flow and interaction between droplets are responsible for stretching the oil drops in the flow direction.\nThe fluctuations in dispersed flow are less intense and similar in both directions. The observed uniformity in the water-film-thickness fluctuations can be explained by the existence of\nThe film-thickness time-trace data recorded by the each pair Transmitter-Receiver in the planar sensor were used to examine average characteristics of the film. The interfacial structure kinematic and geometrical characteristics measured with the capacitance system were compared with those estimated using the high-speed camera images.\nInterfacial Structure Velocity\nThe velocity was compared with the in-situ oil and water velocities to establish if the interfacial structure was a kinematic wave. The velocity was lower than both, hence it was concluded the interfacial structure was not a kinematic wave.\nThe velocity was compared with the velocity obtained by the images. In both flow patterns studied, the agreement between the data was relatively good.\nWavelenght\nWavelength can be related to the droplet size and the distance between drops. However, this information is restricted to the region near the pipe wall. Therefore, a method based on this technique to obtain average droplet size would be more suitable for fully dispersed flow, where a uniform distribution of droplets over the cross-sectional area is usually observed.\nThe capacitance system technique was applied to measure the wavelength and compared with the results of the image-based technique with an average relative error of 36.6% for unstable-annular flow. For the dispersed flows, the wavelength is related to the distance between bubbles and the average relative error was 18.3%. There is an intrinsic error in the 2-D images-based technique due to the big number of oil drops at the interface, i.e., there were too many oil drops overlapping on another.\nThe wavelength results were compared with theoretical droplet-diameter data from the literature, showing a good agreement with the estimated wavelength.\nEmpirical Correlations\nThe interfacial structure characteristics measured with the capacitance system were compared with correlations found in the literature. Velocity was compared with two correlations\nbased on core-annular flow data. For unstable-annular flow, the best agreement was observed with the Rodriguez &amp; Bannwart (2006) correlations. That correlation was obtained for a coreannular flow with interfacial waves, dispersed drops and a turbulent water flow. The collected velocity actually describes the average velocity of drops flowing near the pipe wall. A possible explanation for the agreement is that the unstable-annular flow observed in this work possesses some dynamic similitude with the core-annular flow studied by Rodriguez &amp; Bannwart (2006).\nEmpirical correlations between velocity and Froude number have been developed based on the capacitance-system data for the typical oil-water flow studied in this work. For dispersed flow, the correlation had a good agreement with the data. The average relative error was of 16.7%. For unstable-annular flow, the error was 19.8%.\n7.2\tRecommendations\nBased on the present research, the following recommendations are proposed:\n1.\tInvestigating the influence of the oil viscosity on the water-film thickness and the frictional pressure drop.\n2.\tStudying the effect of other flow parameters, including pipe material, diameter and roughness in the water-film thickness.\n3.\tTesting other wave-analysis methods to improve the frequency estimation, as wavelet decomposition or Gabor decomposition.\n4.\tComparing the results with other measurement techniques to get more information about the studied characteristics and to explain better the difference between results provided by the image-analysis technique and the capacitance-measurement system. For instance, estimating wavelength using Wire-Mesh sensing and wave velocity using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV).\n5.\tSimulating the annular and dispersed oil-water flows using a finite elements software to predict the interfacial wave and compare with the experimental data.\n6.\tApplying the obtained experimental data to improve empirical or theoretical models for holdup and pressure drop prediction.\n152\nREFERENCES\nADDLESEE, A.

The ADC voltage resolution is A D Cres=2V/16384 levels= 122 gV/level. Thus, for the measurement range\nUx - Ux 0 0434 V\n2200=\t5- = 0.0434 V = 355 levels,\nADC^\t122 uV/level\nand the depth resolution can be estimated as\n2200 Lim-0 urn\t,\n= 6.2 um / level\n355 levels\nTemporal resolution calculation\nThe measured transient time for each transmitter was 5.2 gs (Figure B.1). To have a safety margin was set a time of 6 gs.\nFigure B.1 - Transient time for a signal in the measurement system.\nThe transmission circuit has 32 transmission lines then the time to get a frame is\nT32Tx = 6 Us x 32 =196 us / frame\nwhich gives a maximum rate of frames of 5208 frames/second. In this work, it was used a frame rate of 5000 frames/second to ensure that the system was working in steady state.\n174\nAPPENDIX C\nList of publications\nThis thesis has been in part based on the following papers:\nBONILLA RIANO, A., RODRIGUEZ, I.H., BANNWART, A. and RODRIGUEZ, O.
