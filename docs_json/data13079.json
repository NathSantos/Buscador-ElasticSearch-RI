Para isso, dez colunas horizontais foram simuladas em computador, sendo preenchidas\ncom material de textura franca ou argilosa, puros ou em combina\u00e7\u00f5es de camadas alternadas\ndos dois materiais, seguindo a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de um Conjunto de Cantor determin\u00edstico com\ndimens\u00e3o fractal ? 0,63.  As simula\u00e7\u00f5es de movimento horizontal de \u00e1gua foram realizadas\nno modelo num\u00e9rico Hydrus 2D.  Os par\u00e2metros sortividade (S) e expoente de tempo (n) da\nequa\u00e7\u00e3o de Philip foram estimados para cada simula\u00e7\u00e3o, utilizando o m\u00f3dulo de regress\u00e3o\nn\u00e3o linear do software SAS\u00ae.  A sortividade aumentou com o aumento de material de textura\nfranca nas colunas, o que foi atribu\u00eddo \u00e0 depend\u00eancia do par\u00e2metro S no raio capilar.  O\npar\u00e2metro expoente de tempo estimado por regress\u00e3o n\u00e3o linear mostrou valor menor que o\nvalor emp\u00edrico de 0,5 sugerido na literatura.

From a non-fractal perspective,\nthe position of any volumetric water content within a\nporous media column can be characterized by:\n\nx = ?(?).tn (1)\n\nwhere x = Vertical distance within the column [L], ?\n= Boltzmann variable [L T-n], t = Elapsed time [T], n\n= Time exponent, and ? = Porous media water content\n[L3 L-3].\n\nSimilarly, the process of one-dimensional\ninfiltration of water into a uniform soil as a function\nof time can be characterized by the Philip (1957)\nequation:\n\nI = S.tn (2)\n\nwhere I = Cumulative one-dimensional infiltration [L],\nand S = Sorptivity [L T-n].\n\nIn both (Equations 1 and 2) the time exponent (n)\nwas fixed at 0.5 (Clothier &amp; Scotter, 2002).  However\nin fractal characterization of water movement\nprocesses in the soil, the time empirical coefficient\nwas estimated statistically, along with other hydraulic\nproperties (Guerrini &amp; Swartzendruber, 1994;\nPachepsky &amp; Timlin, 1998).\n\nThe diffusive process in a porous medium can be\ninterpreted as a self-affine fractal.  If this assumption\nholds, there is experimental evidence that the\n\nempirical coefficient n can be associated with fractal\nparameters such as the Hurst exponent (Guerrini &amp;\nSwartzendruber, 1994).  The objective of this study\nwas to evaluate the correspondence between n and\nfractal parameters: fractal dimension (D) and the\nHurst exponent (H).  For this purpose, horizontal\ncolumns with heterogeneous porous media (i.e.  two\ncontrasting grain sizes) were generated following the\nhorizontal distribution of the first four iterations of a\ndeterministic Cantor Bar.  Experiments of water\ntransport were then simulated using Hydrus 2D\nsoftware (Rassam et al., 2003) and n and S parameters\nwere estimated for each simulation run using\nnonlinear regression.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nWater infiltration was simulated using Hydrus 2D\nsoftware (Rassam et al., 2003).  The simulations were\nperformed at the Earth and Planetary Sciences\ndepartment of the University of Tennessee in\nKnoxville, US, from August 2004 to May 2005.  Ten\nporous media scenarios were created in Hydrus 2D\nfollowing the first four iterations of a deterministic\nCantor Bar (CB) with fractal dimension: D = log(2)/\nlog(3) ? 0.6309 and b = 3 (Figure 1).  Two materials\nwith distinct particle sizes were used to generate the\niterations of the CB, pure clay and pure loam.  The\ncriterion to define clay and loam materials was based\non the clay, silt and sand content of each material\n(Figure 2).  The van Genuchten (1980) parameters\nand saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) were higher\nin the loam material (Table 1).\n\n\n\nMODELING WATER MOVEMENT IN HORIZONTAL COLUMNS USING FRACTAL THEORY          1465\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 34:1463-1468, 2010\n\n(Figure 1).  The columns were defined by a\ncombination of two materials (clay and loam) and five\niterations (i = 0 to 4) resulting in 10 treatments: two\nmaterials x five iterations = 10 columns.  At the zeroth\niteration, infiltration was simulated in columns filled\nin two ways: pure clay (CLAY0) and pure loam\n(LOAM0) (Figure 3a).  For the subsequent iterations,\nthe two materials were layered horizontally within\nthe column following the distribution of the CB.  In\nthe first iteration, one loam layer was inserted in the\nclay column (CLAY1) and one clay layer was inserted\nin the loam column (LOAM1) (Figure 3b).  The filling\npattern following the CB distribution was used to\ndefine each treatment until the fourth iteration\n(Figure 3e) as follows: CLAY0; CLAY1; CLAY2;\nCLAY3; CLAY4; and LOAM0; LOAM1; LOAM2;\nLOAM3; LOAM4.  With increasing iterations, the\ncontent of the interlayered material (i.e.  loam in the\nclay column and clay in the loam column) increased\nuntil exceeding the original material in the column\n(Figure 3).\n\nEach simulation represented a 10-min water\ninfiltration experiment for each column.  The initial\ntime step was 0.1 min and the minimum and\nmaximum were 0.01 and 0.5 min, respectively.  The\n\u201ccumulative water boundary fluxes\u201d output files of\nHydrus 2D (Cum_Q.out) were used for the statistical\nanalysis of the results.  The files were imported into\nMicrosoft Excel\u00ae and converted to *.xls format.  The\n\nMaterials were mixed in 10 x 10 cm columns\nfollowing the iterations of a deterministic CB\n\nFigure 2.

Bras. Ci. Solo, 34:1463-1468, 2010\n\ntime and cumulative volume infiltration were fitted\nto equation 2 using nonlinear regression in the \u201cnlin\u201d\nprocedure of SAS\u00ae.  The parameters sorptivity (S) and\ntime exponent (n) were estimated by nonlinear\nregression procedures.  Sorptivity was also estimated\nwith the time exponent fixed at 0.5 (Clothier &amp; Scotter,\n2002).  The estimated fractal dimension was calculated\nfollowing Feder (1989):\n\nD = d \u2013 H (3)\n\nwhere D = Fractal dimension, d = Euclidean dimension\n(d = 1 for the Cantor Bar), H = Hurst exponent.\n\nThe Hurst exponent (H) was associated with the\ntime exponent (n) following (Guerrini &amp; Swartzendruber,\n1994).  The estimated fractal dimension could\ntherefore be calculated as:\n\nD = 1 - n (4)\n\nwhere all definitions were as above.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nInfiltration simulations\n\nSimulations of infiltration versus time in pure clay\nand clay mixed with loam following the iterations of\nthe Cantor Bar (CB) are illustrated in figure 4.  The\ncumulative infiltration rate increased as the loam\ncontent increased with each iteration of the CB.  An\ninverse behavior was observed in loam simulations\nwhere the cumulative infiltration rate decreased as\nthe amount of clay increased within the columns\n(Figure 5).\n\nSoil sorptivity (S) was defined as the gravity-free,\ncapillary-induced absorption (Clothier &amp; Scotter,\n2002). The greater infiltration in the columns with\nhigher loam content is reflected in the Sorptivity (S)\nplots as a function of iteration level (Figure 6).\n\nSorptivity decreased exponentially with each iteration\nlevel in loam simulations and increased exponentially\nfor clay.  White &amp; Sully (1987) found that S decreased\nin soil materials following the order: fine Brindabella\nfine sand > Brindabella silty clay loam > Molonglo\nloam > Bungendore fine Sand (70 %) > Kaolinite\n(30 %).  The overall sorptivity for increasing water\npotentials was also greater for coarser material\n(Pilliago sand) than in finer soil material\n(Murrumbateman silty clay loam) in a study\nconducted by White &amp; Perroux (1989).  Mapa et al.\n(1986) found that the overall S was greater in a silty\nclay loam (Typic Torrox) than clay soil (Vertic\nHaplustox).  Talsma (1969) also found a decrease of S\nwith particle size, and that S was one order of\nmagnitude greater in sand than in clay loam soil.\n\nThe results of the simulations in Hydrus 2D and\nfrom the literature are evidence enough that sorptivity\nis greater in coarser materials.  However this is\nsomewhat contrary to the sorptivity definition and\nalso to the intuitive knowledge that pure clays would\nhave a greater capillary absorption potential than\ncoarser materials.  Some hypotheses on why the\n\nFigure 6. Sorptivity parameter estimated with time\nexponent fixed at 0.5 at each iteration level for\nclay and loam materials.\n\nFigure 5.

Bras. Ci. Solo, 34:1463-1468, 2010\n\nsorptivity would be higher in a coarse than in finer\nmedia were therefore investigated.\n\nSorptivity is an integral soil-water property that\ncontains information about the soil hydraulic\nconductivity, soil water potential and soil diffusivity\n(White &amp; Perroux, 1987).  In a first analysis, the\ndependence of S on saturated hydraulic conductivity\n(Ks) was investigated.  S and Ks are not independent\nvariables; Ks is roughly proportional to S2 (Clothier &amp;\nScotter, 2002).  Following this premise, and using the\nKs values 3.33 x 10-3 and 1.72 x 10-2 cm s-1 for clay\nand loam, respectively (Table 1), the estimated\nsorptivities values would be around 0.06 for clay and\n0.13 for loam.  These values, although roughly\nestimated, are of the same order of magnitude as those\nestimated based on simulations.  Therefore the\nbehavior observed in this research is once more\nconfirmed.\n\nSorptivity is also defined as a measure of the\ncapillary removal of water, being essentially a\nproperty of the medium.  It is similar to the \u201ccapillary\nabsorption coefficient\u201d which is proportional to the\nsquare root of the capillary radius (Philip, 1957).\nTherefore, the smaller the capillary radius (i.e.  the\nfiner the soil particle size), the smaller the \u201ccapillary\nabsorption coefficient\u201d and thus, sorptivity.\n\nSoil sorptivity is proportional to the pore diameter\nof the medium.  The sorptivity of clay, despite a higher\ncapillary rise potential, was not higher than in the\nloam material.  The early-time infiltration rates,\nwhich are directly proportional to sorptivity, were also\nlower in clay.  From these results and also from\nliterature it is possible to conclude that the lower\nporosity of pure clays does not allow a higher\ninfiltration rate, despite a higher capillary rise\npotential than in coarser materials.  Also, the\nrelationship between sorptivity and saturated\nhydraulic conductivity is not clear enough to define\nthe real influence of Ks and gravity on early-time\ninfiltration.  Clear quantitative and qualitative\ndefinitions on the significance of the term \u201cearly-time\ninfiltration\u201d are also needed to improve the\ninterpretation of sorptivity experiments.\n\nFractal characterization of infiltration\nprocess\n\nSorptivity estimated with the time exponent\nparameter (n) fixed at 0.5 was not statistically\ndifferent from sorptivity estimated with n also\nestimated in the nonlinear regression procedures\n(Figure 7).  The variation of S estimated with varying\nn at each iteration level for clay and loam is illustrated\nin figure 8.  There are no visual differences between\nfigures 6 and 8.  The use of n fixed at 0.5 or n estimated\nby regression procedures had no influence on the\nestimated sorptivity value.  The estimated n values\nwere therefore used in the fractal characterization of\nthe infiltration process (Guerrini &amp; Swartzendruber,\n1994; Pachepsky &amp; Timlin, 1998).\n\nAs described earlier, the estimated time exponent\n(n) was associated with the fractal parameter Hurst\nexponent (H) (Guerrini &amp; Swartzendruber, 1994).  The\nn = H values ranged from 0.43 to 0.49 (  = 0.48; ? =\n0.028) in clay and from 0.47 to 0.49 (  = 0.49; ? =\n0.008) in loam, where  = average and ? = standard\ndeviation.  The variation of the time exponent at each\niteration level for clay and loam is shown in figure 9.\nThe mean fractal dimension (Dc) value calculated from\nn = H values of clay and loam, using equation 4, was\n0.52.  The fractal dimension of the Cantor Bar used\nto generate the soil columns (D) was approximately\n0.63.  Therefore, the variation between Dc and D was\nrelatively small (around 17.5 %).\n\nThe Hurst exponent associated with the time\nexponent was less than the traditional 0.5 for all\nmaterials and iteration levels.  The character of a\nBrownian motion is expressed and classified as either\nregular or fractional, according to the value of the\nHurst exponent.  The conventional diffusion is\nassociated with a regular Brownian motion if H ? 0.5\nand as a fractional Brownian motion if 0 &lt;H ? 0.5 &lt;1\n\nFigure 8. Sorptivity parameter estimated with the\ntime exponent also estimated by regression at\neach iteration level for clay and loam materials.\n\nFigure 7. 1:1 plot of Sorptivity (S) estimated with\ntime exponent (n) fixed at 0.5 and with time\nexponent also estimated by regression.\n\n\n\n1468 Tairone Paiva Le\u00e3o &amp; Edmund Perfect\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 34:1463-1468, 2010\n\n(Guerrini &amp; Swartzendruber, 1994).  According to the\nresults of this study, the Brownian motion process in\n\u201cearly-time\u201d water infiltration in soil can be classified\nas fractional, since H &lt;0.5.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nHydrus 2D adequately simulated the \u201cearly-time\u201d\ninfiltration process for pure clay and pure loam and\nclay and loam materials mixed in different proportions\nfollowing the horizontal distribution of a Cantor Bar\nwith fractal dimension D ? 0.63.  Soil sorptivity\nincreased as the loam content increased in the\ncolumns.  This behavior was attributed to the\ndependence of the sorptivity parameter on capillary\nradius.  The time exponent parameter estimated by\nnonlinear regression was found to be less than the\ntraditional value of 0.5.  The fractal dimension\nestimated from the Hurst exponent was 17.5 % lower\nthan the fractal dimension of the Cantor Bar used to\ngenerate the columns.  Since the value of H was\ndifferent from 0.5, the water diffusion process within\nthe columns was characterized as fractional Brownian\nmotion.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe authors would like to thank the University of\nBras\u00edlia, Decanato de Pesquisa e P\u00f3s-Gradua\u00e7\u00e3o for\ncovering the publication charges.\n\nLITERATURE CITED\n\nANDERSON, A.N.; CRAWFORD, J.W. &amp; MCBRATNEY, A.B.\nOn diffusion in fractal soil structures.
