Engenharia de Alimentos \u2013 FEA \u2013 UNICAMP \n\n \nRESUMO GERAL \n\n \nA utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de diversos biopol\u00edmeros \u00e9 uma pr\u00e1tica comum nas ind\u00fastrias de alimentos, \n\nespecialmente em produtos l\u00e1cticos, embutidos e a base de soja. O objetivo geral deste \n\ntrabalho foi estudar as intera\u00e7\u00f5es entre prote\u00ednas e polissacar\u00eddeos em sistemas contendo, \n\nou n\u00e3o, co-soluto, em solu\u00e7\u00e3o aquosa (pH 7,0) ou g\u00e9is acidificados. Dentre as prote\u00ednas e \n\nos polissacar\u00eddeos utilizados na ind\u00fastria de alimentos, foram estudados mais \n\nprofundamente a goma xantana, o caseinato de s\u00f3dio e o isolado prot\u00e9ico de soja (tanto em \n\nsolu\u00e7\u00e3o quanto em g\u00e9is). Os polissacar\u00eddeos jata\u00ed (LBG), gelana, Na-alginato e ?-carragena \n\nforam estudados apenas em solu\u00e7\u00f5es. As intera\u00e7\u00f5es entre os componentes foram estudadas \n\n1) por microscopias confocal, de for\u00e7a at\u00f4mica e de contraste de fases e rheo-SALS (\u201csmall \n\nangle light scattering\u201d); 2) por reologia a baixas e altas deforma\u00e7\u00f5es, em cisalhamento ou \n\ncompress\u00e3o; 3) por an\u00e1lises qu\u00edmicas para determinar o tipo de for\u00e7a das intera\u00e7\u00f5es. Os \n\nestudos sobre as propriedades f\u00edsicas de solu\u00e7\u00f5es puras de biopol\u00edmeros mostraram que \n\nsolu\u00e7\u00f5es de prote\u00edna seguem um comportamento Newtoniano, enquanto que os \n\npolissacar\u00eddeos apresentam comportamento Newtoniano a baixa concentra\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\npseudopl\u00e1stico com o aumento desta. O tratamento t\u00e9rmico de solu\u00e7\u00f5es de xantana bem \n\ncomo a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de sacarose reduziram a elasticidade da solu\u00e7\u00e3o, sendo que a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nsacarose afetou as propriedades reol\u00f3gicas apenas de solu\u00e7\u00f5es anisotr\u00f3picas ou bif\u00e1sicas \n\n(anisotropia e isotropia simult\u00e2neas). Um novo modelo baseado na equa\u00e7\u00e3o de BST (Blatz, \n\nSharda, Tschoegl, 1974) foi proposto para predizer um maior n\u00famero de propriedades \n\nmec\u00e2nicas dos g\u00e9is biopolim\u00e9ricos tendo sido observado um bom ajuste dos dados. Quanto \n\nmais lenta a acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o promovida por GDL, mais interconectada e forte foi a rede \n\nprot\u00e9ica em g\u00e9is puros de Na-caseinato e SPI. O aumento da tens\u00e3o e deforma\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\n\n\n xx\n\nruptura de g\u00e9is formados com GDL foi obtida pelo aumento da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de prote\u00edna \n\nem g\u00e9is puros de SPI, pela adi\u00e7\u00e3o de xantana ou pela redu\u00e7\u00e3o do conte\u00fado de prote\u00edna em \n\ng\u00e9is contendo xantana. Por outro lado, a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de xantana enfraqueceu os g\u00e9is t\u00e9rmicos de \n\nSPI, provavelmente devido a liga\u00e7\u00e3o deste polissacar\u00eddeo com a sub-unidade ?-7S. Em \n\nsolu\u00e7\u00f5es aquosas pH 7,0, a ?-carragena foi mais compat\u00edvel com o Na-caseinato e com SPI \n\ndo que o Na-alginato. No entanto, os resultados de \u201crheo-SALS\u201d e CLSM mostraram que \n\nmisturas de caseinato e alginato apresentaram maior capacidade de formar emuls\u00f5es do tipo \n\n\u00e1gua-\u00e1gua do que sistemas com carragena. Al\u00e9m disto, o sistema com SPI e Na-alginato \n\ntamb\u00e9m formou emuls\u00e3o, mas com a fase dispersa de prote\u00edna gelificada. Misturas com \n\ngelana apresentaram-se homog\u00eaneas devido a baixa tens\u00e3o interfacial do sistema.  \n\nPalavras-chave: prote\u00edna, polissacar\u00eddeo, intera\u00e7\u00e3o, gel, emuls\u00e3o, biopol\u00edmero, solu\u00e7\u00e3o, \n\nreologia, separa\u00e7\u00e3o de fases, CLSM, \u201crheo-SALS\u201d. \n\n\n\n xxi\n\n?\n?????\n?????\n\nAUTHOR: Ana Luiza Mattos Braga \n\nTITLE: Formation, structure and rheological properties of biopolymers \n\nsystems. \n\nSUPERVISOR: Prof. Dra.

The aim of the present Ph.D. thesis was to study the \n\nprotein-polysaccharide interactions in aqueous systems (pH 7.0) or acidified gels. It was \n\nstudied seven different biopolymers used in the food industry, being two proteins and five \n\npolysaccharides. Soy protein isolate (SPI), Na-caseinate and xanthan were studied in \n\naqueous solutions and gels systems, while locust bean gum (LBG), gellan, Na-alginate and \n\n?-carrageenan were studied only in aqueous solutions. The protein-polysaccharide \n\ninteractions were evaluated as following: 1) microstructures \u2013 by using confocal (CLSM), \n\natomic force and phase contrast microscopes and rheo-SALS (small angle light scattering); \n\n2) macrostructures, evaluated trough small- and large-strain rheology under shear or \n\ncompression; 3) chemical analysis - in order to determine the kind of interaction forces that \n\nmaintained the gels structure. The results on the physical properties of pure biopolymers \n\nsolutions revealed that the proteins showed Newtonian behaviour, while the \n\npolysaccharides showed either Newtonian or non-Newtonian behaviour depending on its \n\ntype and solution concentration. The annealing temperature of xanthan solutions and the \n\naddition of sucrose caused a reduction on the solution elasticity. It was observed that \n\nsucrose affected the rheological properties over all frequency range studied for initially \n\nanisotropic or biphasic xanthan solutions. It was proposed a new model based on BST \n\n(Blatz, Sharda, Tschoegl, 1974) equation to predict a great number of mechanical \n\nproperties, which revealed a very good fit to the data. The slower the acidification by GDL \n\n(glucone-delta-lactone) it was observed a more interconnected and harder network in Na-\n\n\n\n xxii\n\ncaseinate and SPI pure gels. The increase of the breaking stress or strain was obtained by \n\nincreasing the SPI concentration in pure gels, by adding xanthan or by increasing the \n\nprotein concentration in gels made with xanthan. In another hand, the addtion of xanthan let \n\nto weaker heat-induced SPI gels, which was attributed to the electrostatic interactions \n\nbetween xanthan and the ?-7S subunit of SPI. In mixed protein-polysaccharide solutions, \n\nthe results indicated that ?-carrageenan was more compatible with both soy protein and Na-\n\ncaseinate than alginate. However, the Na-caseinate \u2013 Na-alginate mixture showed a greater \n\ncapacity to form water-in-water emulsions than Na-caseinate - carrageenan system as \n\nobserved by rheo-SALS and CLSM. In addition, the system with SPI and Na-alginate also \n\nformed emulsions but with a gelified protein dispersed phase. The interfacial tension of \n\nsystems containing gellan was very low resulting in homogeneous mixtures. \n\nKeywords: proteins, polysaccharides, interaction, gel, emulsion, biopolymer solution, \n\nrheology, phase separation, CLSM, rheo-SALS. \n\n \n \n\n\n\nCap\u00edtulo 1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 1\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCAP\u00cdTULO 1.

Al\u00e9m disto, tem-se observado que este ramo da ind\u00fastria tem investido \n\nesfor\u00e7os em fabricar produtos com alto valor agregado, podendo-se destacar os produtos \n\nl\u00e1cteos ou a base de soja. Produtos l\u00e1cteos \u201clight\u201d ou \u201cdiet\u201d, obtidos a partir da substitui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ntotal ou parcial de ingredientes como a gordura, apresentam uma textura diferente da do \n\nproduto tradicional. Com o intuito de obter-se uma textura similar a este, as novas \n\nformula\u00e7\u00f5es v\u00eam sendo adicionadas de polissacar\u00eddeos e/ou concentrados prot\u00e9icos. A \n\ntextura tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 vista pelos fabricantes de tofu como fator determinante da aceitabilidade \n\ndeste produto, ao lado da capacidade de reten\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua que aumenta o peso e \n\nconsequentemente o valor econ\u00f4mico deste alimento (Abd Karim et al., 1999).  \n\nA prote\u00edna de soja vem sendo encontrada cada vez mais em uma maior diversidade \n\nde produtos, sendo que sua aplica\u00e7\u00e3o varia desde substituinte de prote\u00ednas em produtos \n\nl\u00e1cteos e em embutidos a diversos tipos de massas e bebidas (Embrapa, 2005). Esta \n\nprote\u00edna apresenta alto valor nutricional e propriedades funcionais interessantes como \n\ngelificante ou espessante, que contribuem para a modifica\u00e7\u00e3o da textura do alimento \n\n(Kinsella, 1979). A soja \u00e9 capaz de prevenir uma s\u00e9rie de doen\u00e7as como as \n\ncardiovasculares, al\u00e9m de auxiliar na preven\u00e7\u00e3o de c\u00e2ncer e osteoporose. Aliada a esta \n\ngrande aplicabilidade, a soja \u00e9 importante para a economia nacional, visto que o Brasil \u00e9 o \n\nsegundo maior produtor mundial de soja, com 27% do mercado (Embrapa, 2005).  \n\nA case\u00edna \u00e9 a prote\u00edna encontrada em maior abund\u00e2ncia no leite (80%), tendo quatro \n\nfra\u00e7\u00f5es principais (?S1-, ?S2-, ?- e ?-case\u00edna) que apresentam-se ligadas na forma de micela \n\nno leite (Walstra e Jenness, 1984).

Este ingrediente \u00e9 usado na ind\u00fastria de alimentos, \n\nprincipalmente em produtos l\u00e1cteos como em queijos tipo \u201ccottage\u201d e \u201ccheddar\u201d, bebidas e \n\nsobremesas. As prote\u00ednas do leite apresentam algumas propriedades funcionais importantes \n\ncomo agente espumante, emulsificante e gelificante (Sgarbieri, 1996).  \n\nOs polissacar\u00eddeos s\u00e3o utilizados nos produtos para aumentar a viscosidade de \n\nformula\u00e7\u00f5es l\u00edquidas, como agentes gelificantes ou ainda para aumentar sua reten\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\n\u00e1gua (Syrbe et al., 1998, Abd Karim et al., 1999). Os polissacar\u00eddeos mais utilizados em \n\nalimentos s\u00e3o obtidos a partir de endosperma de plantas, de algas ou por fermenta\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nmicrobiana. As gomas xantana e gelana s\u00e3o polissacar\u00eddeos ani\u00f4nicos de origem \n\nmicrobiana. Outros dois polissacar\u00eddeos ani\u00f4nicos s\u00e3o os alginatos e as carragenas, ambos \n\nobtidos a partir de algas marinhas. Tanto as carragenas quanto a gelana apresentam a \n\ncapacidade particular de formar g\u00e9is termo-revers\u00edveis em solu\u00e7\u00f5es aquosas (Chaplin, \n\n2005). A xantana, a gelana e a carragena s\u00e3o conhecidas pela mudan\u00e7a da conforma\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nordenada em forma de h\u00e9lices \u00e0 desordenada com a varia\u00e7\u00e3o da temperatura, concentra\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ne for\u00e7a i\u00f4nica do sistema (Paradossi e Brant, 1982; Lee e Brant, 2002; Ikeda et al., 2004).

Estudos sobre as intera\u00e7\u00f5es das prote\u00ednas do leite com diferentes \n\n\n\nCap\u00edtulo 1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 5\n\npolissacar\u00eddeos, utilizando as mais diversas t\u00e9cnicas, t\u00eam sido conduzidos por alguns \n\ngrupos de pesquisa (Zhang e Foegeding, 2003; Braga e Cunha, 2004; Antonov et al., 2004; \n\nMoschakis et al., 2005). N\u00e3o s\u00e3o menos importantes os estudos sobre as intera\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\nprote\u00edna de soja com polissacar\u00eddeos, embora existam poucos trabalhos sobre este tema na \n\nliteratura (Carp et al., 1999; Abd Karim et al., 1999; Chang et al., 2003) e um grande \n\naumento na diversidade de produtos a base de soja. Solu\u00e7\u00f5es ou g\u00e9is com mais de um \n\nbiopol\u00edmero exibem comportamentos mais complexos do que misturas de pol\u00edmeros \n\nsint\u00e9ticos. Isto se deve ao fato de que os biopol\u00edmeros possuem um equil\u00edbrio relacionado \n\nao estado de ordem - desordem de conforma\u00e7\u00e3o, al\u00e9m de apresentar transi\u00e7\u00f5es e separa\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nde fases em determinadas situa\u00e7\u00f5es (C\u00e8saro et al., 1999). Intera\u00e7\u00f5es entre pol\u00edmeros \n\nresultam em incompatibilidade e forma\u00e7\u00f5es complexas, sendo exce\u00e7\u00e3o a miscibilidade \n\nentre os componentes. \n\nAs propriedades de um gel prot\u00e9ico, como textura e sinerese, podem ser alteradas \n\nn\u00e3o s\u00f3 pela adi\u00e7\u00e3o de polissacar\u00eddeos como tamb\u00e9m pelas varia\u00e7\u00f5es na for\u00e7a i\u00f4nica e pH do \n\nsistema (Renkema et al., 2000). A forma\u00e7\u00e3o de uma rede prot\u00e9ica \u00e9 o resultado da \n\nagrega\u00e7\u00e3o das mol\u00e9culas de prote\u00edna, a partir da desnatura\u00e7\u00e3o pr\u00e9via destas e/ou da \n\nacidifica\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema. O processo de acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o pode ser realizado de duas formas, \n\nsendo a tradicional atrav\u00e9s da a\u00e7\u00e3o de cultura bacteriana e a outra com o uso de reagentes \n\nqu\u00edmicos, como o glucona-delta-lactona (GDL). O uso de GDL apresenta a vantagem de \n\ncausar um decr\u00e9scimo lento do pH e evitar algumas dificuldades associadas com o uso de \n\nbact\u00e9rias (Lucey et al., 1998). Utsumi e Kinsella (1985) relataram que as for\u00e7as \n\nmoleculares envolvidas na forma\u00e7\u00e3o de g\u00e9is t\u00e9rmicos de isolado prot\u00e9ico de soja s\u00e3o pontes \n\nde hidrog\u00eanio e intera\u00e7\u00f5es hidrof\u00f3bicas, enquanto que o gel \u00e9 mantido por pontes de \n\nhidrog\u00eanio e dissulfeto. As for\u00e7as das intera\u00e7\u00f5es entre fra\u00e7\u00f5es prot\u00e9icas v\u00eam sendo \n\n\n\nCap\u00edtulo 1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 6\n\ndistinguidas e quantificadas atrav\u00e9s de solubilidade prot\u00e9ica em diferentes tamp\u00f5es e \n\neletroforese em gel de poliacrilamida (Petruccelli e A\u00f1\u00f3n, 1995). O tamp\u00e3o Tris \u00e9 usado \n\npara romper as intera\u00e7\u00f5es eletrost\u00e1ticas, a ur\u00e9ia atua rompendo as pontes de hidrog\u00eanio e as \n\nintera\u00e7\u00f5es hidrof\u00f3bicas, enquanto as pontes dissulfeto s\u00e3o reduzidas na presen\u00e7a de ?-\n\nmercaptoetanol (Cheftel et al., 1996). \n\nMisturas aquosas de prote\u00ednas e polissacar\u00eddeos s\u00e3o geralmente incompat\u00edveis, \n\napresentando separa\u00e7\u00e3o de fases segregativa em pH 7,0. Em alguns casos, o sistema pode \n\napresentar microsepara\u00e7\u00e3o de fases com uma morfologia interessante, que pode variar \n\ndesde estruturas elongadas at\u00e9 a forma de gota. Neste tipo de sistema, cada fase \u00e9 rica em \n\num dos dois biopol\u00edmeros e quando a estrutura formada \u00e9 do tipo gota, a mistura \u00e9 \n\nconsiderada uma emuls\u00e3o \u00e1gua-\u00e1gua (Tolstogusov, 1986). Este tipo de estrutura apresenta \n\ncaracter\u00edsticas reol\u00f3gicas peculiares e vem sendo utilizada na ind\u00fastria de alimentos na \n\nsubstitui\u00e7\u00e3o de gorduras (Capron et al., 2001). Entretanto, algumas peculiaridades das \n\nemuls\u00f5es \u00e1gua-\u00e1gua, como a miscibilidade limitada e os valores extremamente baixos de \n\ntens\u00e3o interfacial, podem adicionar uma complica\u00e7\u00e3o extra para a descri\u00e7\u00e3o reol\u00f3gica do \n\nsistema bem como dos processos de mistura e dispers\u00e3o dos dois biopol\u00edmeros (van \n\nPuyvelde et al., 2002).  \n\nO estudo reol\u00f3gico de g\u00e9is e solu\u00e7\u00f5es vem ganhando a aten\u00e7\u00e3o de v\u00e1rios grupos de \n\npesquisa, visto que pode ser associado com a estrutura, a qual \u00e9 consequ\u00eancia das \n\nintera\u00e7\u00f5es entre os ingredientes, podendo levar \u00e0 redu\u00e7\u00e3o de custos de processos e \n\nauxiliando o desenvolvimento de novos materiais e produtos. As propriedades mec\u00e2nicas \n\nobtidas em compress\u00e3o uniaxial podem ser relacionadas com a textura sensorial e os dados \n\nobtidos t\u00eam sido ajustados por modelos emp\u00edricos ou fundamentais (Foegeding et al., \n\n\n\nCap\u00edtulo 1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 7\n\n2003). Por outro lado, as propriedades reol\u00f3gicas determinadas em cisalhamento, como a \n\nviscosidade aparente, s\u00e3o importantes para o dimensionamento de equipamentos. Al\u00e9m \n\ndestas propriedades reol\u00f3gicas, as obtidas em baixas deforma\u00e7\u00f5es por compress\u00e3o ou \n\ncisalhamento conferem informa\u00e7\u00f5es relevantes sobre a estrutura de g\u00e9is e solu\u00e7\u00f5es e sobre \n\na conforma\u00e7\u00e3o molecular de biopol\u00edmeros.

Objetivos \n\nO objetivo geral desta tese de doutorado foi aprofundar o conhecimento sobre as \n\nintera\u00e7\u00f5es entre prote\u00ednas e polissacar\u00eddeos em sistemas contendo, ou n\u00e3o, co-soluto em pH \n\nneutro ou \u00e1cido. Dentre as prote\u00ednas e os polissacar\u00eddeos, foram estudados mais \n\nprofundamente o caseinato de s\u00f3dio (Na), o isolado prot\u00e9ico de soja (SPI) e a goma \n\nxantana. Adicionalmente, as gomas gelana, jata\u00ed (LBG), Na-alginato e ?-carragena foram \n\nusadas com o intuito de explicar como as diferentes conforma\u00e7\u00f5es dos polissacar\u00eddeos \n\n\n\nCap\u00edtulo 1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 8\n\nafetam o comportamento de solu\u00e7\u00f5es contendo uma prote\u00edna e um polissacar\u00eddeo. O \n\nconhecimento das intera\u00e7\u00f5es entre caseinato de s\u00f3dio e xantana foi iniciado com a \n\ndisserta\u00e7\u00e3o de mestrado defendida em 2002. Os resultados obtidos levaram ao interesse por \n\nestudar sistemas mais simples (contendo somente um biopol\u00edmero) e com a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de outra \n\nfonte prot\u00e9ica. \n\nAs intera\u00e7\u00f5es entre os componentes foram estudadas tanto a n\u00edvel microsc\u00f3pico \n\nquanto macrosc\u00f3pico, sendo os objetivos espec\u00edficos da tese descritos a seguir: \n\n1. Para sistemas gelificados (termicamente e/ou acidificado) foram determinadas as \n\npropriedades reol\u00f3gicas a baixas (cisalhamento e compress\u00e3o uniaxial) e altas \n\ndeforma\u00e7\u00f5es (compress\u00e3o uniaxial), a capacidade de reten\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua dos g\u00e9is e a \n\nmicroestrutura dos mesmos (microscopia confocal de varredura laser). O tipo de for\u00e7a \n\nde intera\u00e7\u00e3o foi determinado por solubilidade do gel em diferentes tamp\u00f5es e \n\neletroforese em gel de poliacrilamida (Cap\u00edtulo 4).  \n\n2. Para sistemas n\u00e3o-gelificados (mistos e puros) avaliou-se as propriedades reol\u00f3gicas \n\nsob cisalhamento, o comportamento das fases, as propriedades t\u00e9rmicas durante a \n\ndesnatura\u00e7\u00e3o das prote\u00ednas e a densidade. A microestrutura destes sistemas foi \n\nobservada em microsc\u00f3pio de contraste de fases, microsc\u00f3pio de for\u00e7a at\u00f4mica e por \n\n\u201crheo-small angle light scattering\u201d (rheo-SALS) (Cap\u00edtulos 3 e 5 e Ap\u00eandice). \n\n \n\n3.

Prote\u00ednas \n\n1.1. Case\u00ednas \n\nO leite tem aproximadamente 3,5% de prote\u00edna, sendo 2,9% de case\u00edna e 0,6% de \n\nprote\u00ednas do soro. A presen\u00e7a de f\u00f3sforo (P) nas case\u00ednas permite classific\u00e1-las como \n\nfosfoprote\u00ednas. Estas prote\u00ednas s\u00e3o \u00e1cidas, por serem ricas em \u00e1cido glut\u00e2mico e asp\u00e1rtico. \n\nA composi\u00e7\u00e3o dos amino\u00e1cidos das case\u00ednas lhes confere uma hidrofobicidade ligeiramente \n\nsuperior do que a maioria das prote\u00ednas globulares. Esta propriedade permite que as \n\ncase\u00ednas associem-se facilmente formando complexos de elevado peso molecular, \n\ndenominados micelas. As case\u00ednas s\u00e3o classificadas em quatro grupos principais de acordo \n\ncom suas estruturas prim\u00e1rias: ?s1, ?s2, ? e ? (Cheftel et al., 1989). \n\nAs ?s1-case\u00ednas apresentam uma estrutura pouco ordenada. Al\u00e9m disto, esta fra\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 \n\na que apresenta a maior carga i\u00f4nica e, excluindo-se as ?s2-case\u00ednas, \u00e9 a de menor \n\nhidrofobicidade. As ?s2-case\u00ednas s\u00e3o as mais hidrof\u00edlicas devido \u00e0 maior fosforila\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nmaior quantidade de res\u00edduos cati\u00f4nicos, que resulta em elevada afinidade aos \u00edons Ca2+. \n\nAs ?-case\u00ednas s\u00e3o as que apresentam maior hidrofobicidade, sendo que sua mol\u00e9cula possui \n\numa regi\u00e3o N terminal muito polar e uma regi\u00e3o C terminal hidrof\u00f3bica. Al\u00e9m disto, a \n\nbaixas temperaturas (4 oC) a ?-case\u00edna se dissocia da micela. J\u00e1 as ?-case\u00ednas possuem a \n\nregi\u00e3o N terminal hidrof\u00f3bica e a regi\u00e3o C terminal hidrof\u00edlica (Cheftel et al., 1989). \n\nAs prote\u00ednas do leite apresentam algumas propriedades funcionais importantes \n\ncomo agentes espumantes, emulsificantes e gelificantes, sendo muito utilizadas na \n\nformula\u00e7\u00e3o de produtos aliment\u00edcios (Sgarbieri, 1996). Estas propriedades est\u00e3o \n\nrelacionadas \u00e0 natureza anf\u00f3tera da micela de case\u00edna. A atividade interfacial das case\u00ednas \u00e9 \n\n\n\nCap\u00edtulo 2 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 18\n\nmais not\u00f3ria nas ?-case\u00ednas por estas serem mais flex\u00edveis e encontrarem-se desdobradas na \n\ninterface. J\u00e1 as ?-case\u00ednas apresentam uma estrutura mais ordenada. \n\n1.2. Isolado prot\u00e9ico de soja (SPI) \n\nA soja \u00e9 a mais importante fonte prot\u00e9ica de origem vegetal que \u00e9 utilizada como \n\ningrediente em formula\u00e7\u00f5es de alimentos, visto que este gr\u00e3o apresenta 40% de prote\u00ednas \n\nem sua composi\u00e7\u00e3o (Sgarbieri, 1996). O isolado prot\u00e9ico de soja \u00e9 a forma mais purificada \n\ndas prote\u00ednas de soja, possuindo alto valor nutricional e apresentando diversas propriedades \n\nfuncionais como emulsificante, espumante e espessante, sendo tamb\u00e9m caracterizado como \n\nagente gelificante. Aproximadamente 90% das prote\u00ednas de soja s\u00e3o globulinas e as que \n\nprecipitam em pH 4,5 s\u00e3o tradicionalmente chamadas de glicininas (Kinsella, 1979). \n\nAs fra\u00e7\u00f5es da prote\u00edna de soja s\u00e3o caracterizadas de acordo com as suas \n\npropriedades de sedimenta\u00e7\u00e3o ou peso molecular (Wolf et al, 1961), apresentando os \n\nseguintes coeficientes de Svedberg (S) 2S, 7S, 11S e 15S. Os componentes de baixo peso \n\nmolecular (2S) s\u00e3o compostos inibidores de tripsina, citocromo e outras globulinas. As duas \n\nfra\u00e7\u00f5es principais possuem pesos moleculares elevados, sendo que 20-35% das prote\u00ednas \n\ns\u00e3o referenciadas como globulina 7S (?-conglicinina) e 25-35% como globulina 11S \n\n(glicinina). Ambas s\u00e3o muito complexas, consistindo de diversas subunidades que \n\nfacilmente se associam e dissociam sob diferentes condi\u00e7\u00f5es de pH, for\u00e7a i\u00f4nica e \n\ntratamento t\u00e9rmico (Badley et al., 1975; Kinsella, 1979; Hermansson, 1986). \n\nA glicinina (globulina 11S) consiste de doze cadeias polipept\u00eddicas, sendo 6 \u00e1cidas \n\n(A) e 6 b\u00e1sicas (B) ligadas (AB) por pontes dissulfeto. Segundo, Badley et al.

Polissacar\u00eddeos \n\nOs polissacar\u00eddeos s\u00e3o compostos sol\u00faveis em \u00e1gua e de elevado peso molecular. \n\nEstes ingredientes atuam como estabilizantes e espessantes, devido \u00e0 sua capacidade de \n\naumentar a viscosidade do sistema podendo, inclusive, formar g\u00e9is (Syrbe et al, 1998). Os \n\npolissacar\u00eddeos podem ser utilizados como aditivos em produtos com a proposta de redu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nparcial ou total de gordura. Estes ingredientes atuam suprindo a perda de textura ocasionada \n\npela falta de gordura e evitam a separa\u00e7\u00e3o de fases em emuls\u00f5es (Katzbauer, 1998). A \n\nseguir ser\u00e3o descritas algumas caracter\u00edsticas dos polissacar\u00eddeos utilizados neste trabalho. \n\n2.1. Xantana \n\nA goma xantana \u00e9 um polissacar\u00eddeo microbiano, extracelular, produzido pela \n\nbact\u00e9ria Xanthomonas campestris. A estrutura prim\u00e1ria da mol\u00e9cula de xantana \u00e9 composta \n\nde uma cadeia principal com unidades de D-glucose ligadas em ? (1?4), contendo cadeias \n\nramificadas com duas unidades de manose e uma de \u00e1cido glucur\u00f4nico (Figura 1). O \n\nprimeiro res\u00edduo de manose \u00e9 normalmente acetilado no C6 e toda cadeia ramificada possui \n\num grupamento carbox\u00edlico no res\u00edduo de \u00e1cido glucur\u00f4nico. O res\u00edduo terminal de manose \n\npossui um grau variado de substitui\u00e7\u00e3o por piruvato (Capron et al., 1997). \n\nA xantana, em solu\u00e7\u00e3o, passa por uma transi\u00e7\u00e3o conformacional irrevers\u00edvel de um \n\nestado ordenado e r\u00edgido para um estado mais desordenado e flex\u00edvel (desnaturado), com o \n\naumento da temperatura. Essa transi\u00e7\u00e3o conformacional pode ser medida por algumas \n\n\n\nCap\u00edtulo 2 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 20\n\nt\u00e9cnicas anal\u00edticas como rota\u00e7\u00e3o \u00f3ptica, reologia e calorimetria. A temperatura de transi\u00e7\u00e3o \n\n\u00e9, ainda, fun\u00e7\u00e3o de alguns fatores como a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o da goma e a for\u00e7a i\u00f4nica do meio, \n\nmas geralmente ocorre at\u00e9 50\u00baC (Urlacher &amp; Noble, 1997). Al\u00e9m disto, Lee e Brant (2002) \n\nobservaram uma outra transi\u00e7\u00e3o que foi relacionada \u00e0 transi\u00e7\u00e3o de uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nanisotr\u00f3pica para uma isotr\u00f3pica. Este \u00faltimo fen\u00f4meno mostrou-se dependente da \n\ntemperatura e da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\n \n\nFigura 1. Estrutura molecular da xantana. \n\n2.2. Alginato  \n\nOs alginatos s\u00e3o polissacar\u00eddeos ani\u00f4nicos produzidos por algas marrons do g\u00eanero \n\nLaminaria. A sua estrutura prim\u00e1ria consiste de uma cadeia principal n\u00e3o ramificada, com \n\nunidades de D-\u00e1cido manur\u00f4nico (M) ligados em ?-(1?4) e unidades de L-\u00e1cido \n\ngulur\u00f4nico (G) ligados em ?-(1?4). As unidades M e G s\u00e3o encontradas em blocos e estes \n\nligam-se alternadamente, sendo predominante a sequ\u00eancia de dois \u00e1cidos iguais juntos \n\n(GGMM) como apresentado na Figura 2 (Capron et al., 2001).  \n\n\n\nCap\u00edtulo 2 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 21\n\n \n\nFigura 2.

Rheological properties of biopolymers aqueous \n\nsolutions. \n\n1st PART: Physical properties of pure proteins and polysaccharides aqueous \n\nsolutions. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(in collaboration with LMVT-ETHZ-Switzerland)\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 45\n\nAbstract \n\nThe aim of this work was to examine the physical properties of seven biopolymers (proteins \n\nand polysaccharides) aqueous solutions widely used in the food industry. The \n\npolysaccharides investigated were xanthan, LBG, gellan, ?-carrageenan and Na-alginate, \n\nwhile sodium caseinate and soy protein isolate (SPI) were the proteins source. The proteins \n\nsolutions showed Newtonian behaviour for all concentrations studied, while the \n\npolysaccharides exhibited either Newtonian or non-Newtonian behaviour depending on its \n\ntype and solution concentration. The biopolymers solutions showed different trends for \n\ndensity and apparent viscosity values depending on the biopolymer type (protein and \n\npolysaccharide) and of the biopolymer source. For a given concentration and shear rate, the \n\nincrease of apparent viscosity and the reduction of density of the biopolymer solution \n\nfollowed the order: 1) proteins, 2) microbial polysaccharides (xanthan and gellan), 3) plant \n\nseeds polysaccharide (LBG) and 4) seaweeds polysaccharides (Na-alginate and ?-\n\ncarrageenan). The determined critical overlap concentration (C*) value was not observed \n\nfor microbial polysaccharides, but increased in the following order for the others \n\nbiopolymers studied: LBG<Na-alginate<?-carrageenan<Na-caseinate<SPI.  \n\nKey-words: proteins, polysaccharides, physical properties. \n\n \n\n1. Introduction \n\nWater-soluble high molecular weight polysaccharides or proteins are biopolymers \n\nthat serve a variety of functions in food systems, such as enhancing viscosity, creating gel-\n\nstructures, formation of a film, control of crystallization, inhibition of syneresis, improving \n\ntexture, encapsulation of flavors and lengthening the physical stability, etc. (Dickinson, \n\n2003). These functional ingredients are widely used in dairy products, canned foods, bakery \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 46\n\nproducts, salad dressings, beverages, sauces, soups and other processed foodstuffs to \n\nimprove textural characteristics, flavour and shelf life. \n\nA variety of proteins used in food industry as ingredients can be obtained from \n\nanimals or legume seeds. Soy proteins are the most important representative of legume \n\nproteins due to their high protein level and well-balanced amino-acid composition (Van \n\nVliet et al., 2002). The soy protein fractions can be classified by their sedimentation \n\nconstants, showing approximate Svedberg coefficients of 2S, 7S, 11S and 15S. The two \n\nmajor globulins in soybeans are ?-conglycinin and glycinin, also called 7S and 11S, \n\nrespectively. Milk is a colloidal emulsion of protein particles, with casein being the main \n\nprotein (~80%). Four main types of casein, ?S1-,?S2, ?- and ?-casein, can be distinguished \n\nin milk and are present in a mass ratio of about 4:1:4:1.3. All casein in milk occurs in \n\nmicelles, which are fairly large particles of colloidal size (Walstra and Jenness, 1984). \n\nHowever, the micellar structure of casein is destroyed during the manufacture of sodium \n\ncaseinate (Kinsella, 1984). Na-caseinate is an ingredient widely used in a range of food \n\nformulations because of its nutritional value and functional properties. \n\nMany gums are extracted from plants, others from seaweeds or microbial \n\nfermentation. Locust bean gum (LBG) is a galactomannan extracted by grinding the \n\nendosperm portions of the seeds of the legume plant Ceretonia siliqua L. Galactomannans \n\nare neutral polysaccharides composed of linear main chains. Physico-chemical properties of \n\ngalactomannans are strongly influenced by the galactose content (Morris, 1990) and the \n\ndistribution of the galactose units along the main chain (Launay et al., 1986). LBG \n\nsolutions are almost completely unaffected by pH or heat processing due to its neutral \n\ncharacter (Glicksman, 1969).  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 47\n\nThe two most used seaweeds polysaccharides in the food industry are carrageenans \n\nand alginates. Carrageenans are a family of polymeric sulphated galactans extracted from \n\nvarious species of red seaweed and they are extensively used for their ability to form \n\nthermoreversible gels in water or aqueous salt solutions (Chaplin, 2005). Alginates are \n\nlinear polysaccharides produced as a structural component in marine brown algae. The \n\nsequence of the alginate chain in terms of the sugar monomers ?-D-mannuronate (M) and \n\na-L-guluronate (G) influences the viscosity and also determines the ability of the molecule \n\nto form gels with divalent cations (Moe et al., 1995). \n\nGellan gum is an anionic extracellular polysaccharide produced by fermentation of \n\nSphingomonas elodea. It has been a subject of interest since its discovery in the 1980s \n\n(Kang et al., 1982). Gellan is well-known due to its gelling capacity at high concentrations \n\nor in the presence of cations. Different gel characteristics can be obtained by varying the \n\ndegree of acylation, as well as the type and concentration of cations. Xanthan is also an \n\nanionic polysaccharide produced by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris. In the \n\nmajority of food applications, its primary function is as viscosity enhancer (Speers and \n\nTung, 1986). The changes in composition, mainly the extent of acetylation and \n\npyruvylation, affect properties of xanthan solutions (Sutherland, 1994). A wide range of \n\ndifferent behaviours may be obtained for each biopolymer due to the variation of \n\ncomposition with the source or processing conditions.  \n\nThe rheological properties of fluid food should be carefully taken into account for \n\ndesigning and modeling purposes. Calculations in the processes involving fluid flows such \n\nas pump sizing, extraction or filtration requires the knowledge of large strain-rheological \n\ndata (Marcotte et al., 2001). Polysaccharide solutions are generally non-Newtonian shear-\n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 48\n\nthinning fluids as the apparent viscosity decreases with increasing shear rate. Several \n\nmodels have been used to characterize the flow behavior of gum solutions and among them \n\npower law model has been frequently used for the determination of rheological properties \n\nof the fluid food. The knowledge of the viscous properties of biopolymer solutions in the \n\nlow shear rate Newtonian domain is of practical value for predicting their efficiency as \n\nthickeners in liquid foods or as stabilizers in dispersed systems. Such characteristics could \n\nbe obtained from the relation between the Newtonian viscosity data and the biopolymer \n\nconcentration in order to predict a diluted (C*) and semi-diluted (C**) critical \n\nconcentration regions (Launay et al., 1997). \n\nThe concentration of the biopolymer, and consequently the existence of \n\nentanglements is of particular importance on the rheological behaviour and other physical \n\nproperties of the systems, as density. The aim of this work was to determine the rheological \n\nproperties and density of seven biopolymers aqueous solutions of great application in the \n\nfood industry. The polysaccharides investigated were xanthan, LBG, gellan, ?-carrageenan \n\nand Na-alginate, while sodium caseinate and soy protein isolate (SPI) were the proteins \n\nsource.  \n\n \n\n2. Material and methods \n\n2.1. Material \n\nThe proteins used to prepare the model systems were casein (Sigma Chemical Co., \n\nUSA) and soy protein isolate (SPI) obtained from defatted soy flour (Bunge Alimentos \n\nS.A., Brazil). The polysaccharides used were sodium (Na)-alginate, ?-carrageenan, and \n\ngellan obtained from CP Kelco (USA) and xanthan and LBG purchased from Sigma \n\nChemical Co. (USA). The moisture contents (% w/w) of casein, SPI, xanthan, LBG, Na-\n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 49\n\nalginate, ?-carrageenan, gellan were, respectively, 6.51 \u00b1 0.10, 6.44 \u00b1 0.07, 8.36 \u00b1 0.23, \n\n5.44 \u00b1 0.01, 5.75 \u00b1 0.21, 7.84 \u00b1 0.07 and 6.42 \u00b1 0.12. \n\nThe soy proteins isolation procedure followed the method described by Petruccelli and \n\nA\u00f1\u00f3n (1995). Defatted soy flour was dispersed in distilled water (1:10 w/w) and the pH was \n\nadjusted to 8.0 with 2N NaOH. The dispersion was gently stirred for 2h at room \n\ntemperature and then centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 30 min at 4\u00baC in a Sorvall RC5 Plus \n\ncentrifuge (GSA-rotor, Dupont, UK). The supernatant was adjusted to pH 4.5 with 2N HCl \n\nand centrifuged at 5,000 x g (Sorvall GSA-rotor) for 15 min at 4\u00baC. The precipitate was \n\nthen suspended in water and the pH adjusted to 8.0 with 2N NaOH, followed by freeze-\n\ndrying of the suspension. The protein (N x 6.25) and ash contents of the powder were, \n\nrespectively, 91.25 \u00b1 0.45 and 3.45 \u00b1 0.04. \n\n2.2. Preparation of biopolymers stock solutions \n\nThe Na-caseinate solution was prepared by dispersing casein powder in milli-Q \n\nwater using magnetic stirring for 2 h at a maximum temperature of 50\u00b0C. The pH was \n\nconstantly adjusted to 7.0 with 10M NaOH. The soy protein isolate (SPI) solution (milli-Q \n\nwater) was prepared at room temperature by magnetic stirring until the complete powder \n\nhydration and the pH was adjusted to 7.0 with 1M HCl. The polysaccharide solutions were \n\nprepared by dispersing the powders in milli-Q water at room temperature by magnetic \n\nstirring, then heating in a water bath with a fixed temperature and time (Table 1). The \n\nprepared solutions were immediately cooled down to room temperature in an ice bath, and \n\nnone of them gelified after this process. The insoluble particles of proteins and \n\npolysaccharides solutions were separated by centrifugation in a Sigma centrifuge 3K30 \n\n(rotor no 33310 \u2013 Sigma Laborzentrifugen GmbH, Germany) at 60,000 x g for 60 minutes \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 50\n\nat 25\u00b0C (Antonov et al., 2004), except for ?-carrageenan and gellan solutions that were \n\nalready purified (without any insoluble particles). The pH of all solutions were adjusted to \n\n7.0. The concentration of proteins solutions varied in the range of 1-10% (w/w), while the \n\nrange of polysaccharides concentrations was 0.1-4% (w/w). \n\nTable 1.

Physical properties \n\nThe density and the steady state rheological properties were obtained for each \n\nbiopolymer solution at different concentrations at 25\u00b0C. Density data were obtained in \n\ntriplicate in an oscillating tube densimeter DM38 (Anton Paar, Austria). \n\nThe apparent viscosity (?) as a function of shear stress was determined in triplicate \n\nusing a stress-controlled rheometer (MCR 300, Paar Physica, Austria). A double wall \n\nconcentric cylinder was used and the external diameter of the rotating bob was 13.3 mm, \n\nwhile the internal diameter was 12.8 mm. The stationary cylinder had an internal diameter \n\nof 12.3 mm and an external diameter of 13.8 mm. The measurements were done at 25\u00b0C in \n\nduplicate. Flow curves were obtained by an up-down-up steps program using different \n\nshear stress range to each sample. This range was determined from a shear rate-control \n\nexperiment, in which the maximum shear rate was 300 s-1. The last step (steady state flow) \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 51\n\nwas taken for further data analysis. Flow properties were described by the power-law fitting \n\nto rheological data (Equation 1).  \n\nnk?? ?=  (1) \n\nwhere ??  is the shear rate (s-1); s is the shear stress (Pa); k is the consistency index (Pa.sn) \n\nand n is the flow behavior index. The latter allows to distinguish whether the solution \n\nbehaves as a Newtonian (n = 1) or non-Newtonian liquid (n<1). \n\nThe critical overlap concentration (C*) was determined by plotting specific \n\nviscosity (?sp) as a function of concentration on logarithmic axes as described by Morris et \n\nal. (1981). The inflection point of the curve was taken as an indicative of C*. The specific \n\nviscosity was determined by the ratio of the Newtonian viscosities of the solution and \n\nsolvent as described by Equation 2. \n\n1???\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n=\n\nsolv\nsp ?\n\n?\n?  (2) \n\nwhere ?solv is the solvent viscosity, which is 0.001 Pa.s for water at 25 oC. \n\n \n\n3. Results and discussion \n\n3.1. Density  \n\nThe knowledge of the physical properties is important in order to characterize the \n\nbiopolymer solution and to predict and gain information of the mixed solution behaviour. \n\nAntonov et al. (2004) and Scholten et al. (2002) have shown that the density difference \n\nbetween two coexisting phases of a protein-polysaccharide mixture give information about \n\nthe interfacial tension of the mixture. The density of pure biopolymer solutions as a \n\nfunction of concentration is shown in Equations 3 (R2=0.999), 4 (R2=0.986) and 5 \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 52\n\n(R2=0.996). It was found three behaviours for the different kind of biopolymers, such that \n\nthe density of all proteins could be represented by Equation 3 and the density of microbial \n\npolysaccharide followed the relation described in Equation 4, while the density of plant and \n\nseaweeds polysaccharides are described by Equation 5. The different slopes observed by \n\ncomparing Equations 3-5 could be attributed to two possible factors working either \n\nseparately or concomitantly: (i) the differences in the molecular weight; (ii) a different \n\nreduction of the solution volume with the increase of the concentration, as a result of the \n\nmolecular structures at low concentration and molecular assemblies/network formed in \n\nconcentrated solutions. Regarding the polysaccharides, the second factor seemed to \n\ninfluence more the concentration dependence of density, since carrageenan (Equation 5) \n\nand xanthan (Equation 4) have the two greater molecular weights and they showed different \n\nbehaviour. From the slope of Equations 4 and 5 it can be supposed that microbial \n\npolysaccharides entrap less solvent than plant and seaweeds biopolymers at the studied \n\nconcentrations. This is in agreement with the non-gelling ability of xanthan and also of \n\ngellan at concentrations less than 10 g/L, instead they show assemblies formation (Miyoshi \n\net al., 1996). \n\n9963 +?= PRPR C?     , LgC PR /10010&lt;&lt; (3) \n\n9964 ,, +?= GXGX C?  , LgC X /201&lt;&lt; and LgCG /82&lt;&lt;  (4) \n\n9965 ,,,, +?= LBGACLBGAC C? , LgCC /401&lt;&lt;, LgC A /301&lt;&lt; and LgC LBG /201&lt;&lt; (5) \n\nwhere ? is the density, C is the concentration (g/L) and the subscripts PR, X, LBG, A, C \n\nand G correspond to, respectively, protein, xanthan, locust bean gum, alginate, ?-\n\ncarrageenan and gellan.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 53\n\n3.2. Rheological properties \n\nThe flow curves, at 25\u00b0C, of the seven studied biopolymers are shown in Figure 1. \n\nThe two proteins (Figure 1a) showed Newtonian behaviour for all concentrations studied \n\n(1-10%). At low concentration, the viscosities of both proteins solutions were similar, but \n\nfor a 10% protein solution the Na-caseinate sample showed a 10 fold greater viscosity as \n\ncompared to SPI sample. The polysaccharides showed either Newtonian or non-Newtonian \n\nbehaviour depending on its type and solution concentration. Figures 1B-1C show that at \n\nlow concentration, ?-carrageenan, Na-alginate and LBG behaved as Newtonian fluids. The \n\ntransition to the non-Newtonian behaviour for ?-carrageenan (Figure 1b), Na-alginate \n\n(Figure 1c) and LBG (Figure 1d) occurred, respectively, at 2.5%, 1.5% and 0.5%. In \n\ncontrast, gellan (Figure 1e) and xanthan (Figure 1f) showed non-Newtonian behaviour even \n\nfor the lowest concentration studied, 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. The apparent viscosities \n\n(?) of microbial polysaccharides (xanthan and gellan) were higher than those obtained for \n\nplant or seaweeds biopolymers at a given concentration and shear rate. The ? values for ?-\n\ncarrageenan and Na-alginate, both seaweed biopolymers, were very similar for the same \n\nshear rates and concentration. LBG seemed to have an intermediate behaviour between \n\nseaweeds and microbial polysaccharides. For all samples the ? values increased with \n\nincreasing biopolymers concentration as expected. \n\nIn non-Newtonian solutions the apparent viscosity decreased with increasing shear \n\nrate, which is typical of a shear thinning behavior. For those samples it was observed a \n\nNewtonian region in the low shear rate range before the shear thinning behavior. The power \n\nlaw model (Equation 1) was used to describe the rheological properties of those solutions. \n\nTo evaluate the zero shear viscosity, ?0, the initial slope of the shear stress\u2013shear rate curve \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 54\n\nwas determined. The critical shear rate obtained from the intersection of the power-law and \n\nthe constant viscosity region, ?0, moved to lower values with the increase of concentration \n\nfor each polysaccharide. Moreover, regarding the polysaccharide type the increase of the \n\ncritical shear rate followed the order: microbial &lt;plant &lt;seaweeds. The different values of \n\nthis critical point are associated with the formation and disruption of entanglements. For \n\nhigher shear rates, disruption predominates over formation of new entanglements; \n\nmolecules align in the direction of flow and the apparent viscosity decreases with \n\nincreasing shear rate (Sittikijyothin et al., 2005). \n\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1 10 100 1000\nShear rate (1/s)\n\nA\np\n\np\na\n\nre\nn\n\nt v\nis\n\nco\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\nP\na\n\n.s\n)\n\n(a)\n \n\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0.1 10 1000\nShear rate (1/s)\n\nA\np\n\np\na\n\nre\nn\n\nt v\nis\n\nco\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\nP\na\n\n.s\n)\n\n(b)  \n \n\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0.1 10 1000\nShear rate (1/s)\n\nA\np\n\np\na\n\nre\nn\n\nt v\nis\n\nco\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\nP\na\n\n.s\n)\n\n(c)\n\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0.1 1 10 100 1000\nShear rate (1/s)\n\nA\np\n\np\na\n\nre\nn\n\nt v\nis\n\nco\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\nP\na\n\n.s\n)\n\n(d)  \n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 55\n\n \n\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n0.01 0.1 1 10 100\nShear rate (1/s)\n\nA\np\n\np\na\n\nre\nn\n\nt v\nis\n\nco\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\nP\na\n\n.s\n)\n\n(e)  \n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\n0.001 0.1 10 1000\nShear rate (1/s)\n\nV\nis\n\nco\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\nP\na\n\n.s\n)\n\n(f)\n\nFigure 1.

Some authors \n\n(L\u00f3pez et al. 2004, Mart\u00ednez-Padilla et al. 2004) had previously reported similar n values \n\nfor xanthan solutions. Xanthan and Na-alginate showed an initial steeper decrease of n \n\nfollowed by a plateau region with the increase of concentration. This indicate that the \n\ncapacity of molecular organization under shear did not increased after a given \n\npolysaccharide concentration. It could be suggested that xanthan and Na-alginate formed an \n\nanisotropic ordered aggregates at higher concentrations. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 56\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n0 1 2 3\nConcentration (% w/w)\n\nn \n(-\n\n)\n\n \nFigure 2. Variation of the flow behavior index, n, as a function of polysaccharide \n\nconcentration. Na-alginate (?), gellan (?), LBG (?), xanthan (\t). \n\nDifferent solution regimes can be distinguished by plotting the specific viscosity \n\n(Equation 2) versus concentration on a log-log scale (Morris et al., 1981), as shown in \n\nFigure 3 for the different biopolymers studied here. Launay et al. (1997) have suggested \n\nthat some polysaccharides show two critical concentrations: C*, the point at which reduced \n\nviscosity first departs from linearity, and C**, where a second departure occurs. These two \n\npoints delimit three regions: dilute (C<C*), semi-dilute (C*<C<C**) and concentrated \n\n(C>C*) as follows: \n\n\u2022 In the dilute regime (C<C*): polymer coils have \u201cinfinite dilution\u201d dimensions; \n\n\u2022 In the semi-dilute regime (C*<C<C**): polymer coils are in contact and progressively \n\nshrink as concentration increases; \n\n\u2022 In the concentrated regime (C>C**): polymer coils have reached their limiting size \n\n(unperturbed or q-dimensions). In this regime, polymer chains entangles more. \n\nAmong the polysaccharides studied, the lower C* value was found for LBG, \n\nC*=0.25% (see below), followed by Na-alginate (Figure 3a), C*=0.7%, and ?-carrageenan \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 57\n\n(Figure 3b), C*=0.9%. In the case of ?-carrageenan it was observed a second deviation of \n\nthe curve from the linearity, in which C** was equal 1.8%. It was not possible to determine \n\nC* for gellan (Figure 3b) and xanthan (Figure 3c). However, Mart\u00ednez-Padilla et al. (2004) \n\nreported a specific viscosity equal to 2 for 0.1% gellan, which indicates that gellan had one \n\ncritical point between 0.1 and 0.2%. Launay et al. (1997) reported a C** value equal to \n\n0.1% for xanthan aqueous solutions, while Milas et al. (1990) observed other two regions, \n\nC*=0.0126 and C**=0.078%, for xanthan in water. Probably because of the helical chains \n\nof xanthan and gellan, there is a tendency to entangle at a very low concentration (Wang et \n\nal., 2001). This would not happen with the used ?-carrageenan, since it had low salt \n\nconcentration showing helix formation at temperatures below 25 oC. \n\nBelow C*, Na-alginate and ?-carrageenan showed the same concentration \n\ndependence of ?sp (C0.9), which resembled that expected for random coil polymers, C1.3 \n\n(Morris et al., 1981). For LBG (Figure 3b), it was observed a discontinuity between 0.1% \n\nand 0.5%, but there was not sufficient data to quantify exactly the correct concentration. \n\nThus, for low concentrations, it was plotted a power law dependence of viscosity on \n\nconcentration with the exponent equal to 1.16 as found by Richardson et al. (1998) for \n\nLBG. The C* for LBG was then determined and a value equal to 0.25% was obtained, \n\nwhich was very close to that reported by Richardson et al. (1998) work. \n\nThe concentrated regime (C>C**) was characterized by a power law dependence of \n\nviscosity on concentration. For typical polymers, the exponent is usually found to be in the \n\nrange 3.3\u20135 (Launay et at., 1986). In the present case, the slopes found for Na-alginate \n\n(3.1), xanthan (3.7), LBG (4.2), gellan (4.2) and ?-carrageenan (4.9) were well within the \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 58\n\nusual range. It has been claimed that slopes higher than 3.3 could be explained by the \n\ncreation of \u201chyperentanglements\u201d (Morris et al., 1981).  \n\nFigure 3c shows that after 1% xanthan the specific viscosity of the solution deviates \n\nfrom the expected trend. Harding (1997) reported that for some polyanionic \n\npolysaccharides in a salt-free aqueous solution the conventional reduced viscosity versus \n\nconcentration plot can depart from its positive slope. Moreover, the reduced viscosity can \n\nshow a maximum value and then decrease with the increase in biopolymer concentration. \n\nFor the proteins the concentrations regimes were different from those found for the \n\npolysaccharides. Only C* was observed, independent on the protein type. Na-caseinate \n\nshowed a lower C*, equal 3%, as compared to the value obtained for SPI, 6.5%. This shows \n\nthat SPI is more hydrophobic than caseinate as reported previously by Grinberg and \n\nTolstoguzov (1997) and that it is more compacted and entangles less, although soy proteins \n\nhave a higher molecular weight than that of the caseins. The slope of the power relations \n\nbefore and after C* were similar for both proteins. \n\n  \n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 59\n\n  \nFigure 3.

The long dashed line (b) represents the power law found by \n\nRichardson et al. (1981) for LBG. \n\n \n\n4. Conclusion \n\nThe biopolymers solutions showed different trends for density, apparent viscosity \n\nand critical overlap concentration depending on the biopolymer type (protein and \n\npolysaccharide) and of the biopolymer source. The concentration dependences of density \n\nwere the same for the two proteins studied. In addition, Na-caseinate showed a lower \n\noverlap concentration (C*) than SPI, which was attributed to the more hydrophobic \n\ncharacter of SPI that tend to be more compacted. The proteins showed Newtonian \n\nbehaviour for all concentrations studied, while the polysaccharides showed either \n\nNewtonian or non-Newtonian behaviour depending on its type and solution concentration. \n\nFor a given concentration and shear rate, the increase of apparent viscosity and the \n\nreduction of density of the polysaccharide solution followed the order: 1) microbial \n\npolysaccharides (xanthan and gellan), 2) plant seeds polysaccharide (LBG) and 3) seaweeds \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 60\n\npolysaccharides (Na-alginate and ?-carrageenan). The density trend was attributed to a \n\nlower capacity of microbial polysaccharides to entrap solvent than plant and seaweeds \n\nbiopolymers. It was not possible to observe a C* for xanthan and gellan, while the increase \n\nof C* for the others polysaccharides followed the above order.  \n\n \n\n5.

Rheological properties of biopolymers aqueous \n\nsolutions. \n\n2nd PART: Rheological behaviour and microstructure of xanthan solutions: \n\nannealing temperature and sucrose effects \n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 65\n\nAbstract \n\nThe rheology of annealed xanthan solutions (between 10 - 90\u00baC during 1h) added by \n\nsucrose was studied in oscillatory shear experiments. Xanthan solutions showed three \n\ndifferent transitions passing through anisotropic, biphasic and isotropic regions. It was \n\nobserved many birefringence aggregates by light microscope in the anisotropic and \n\nbiphasic regions. The temperature of annealing affected the elasticity of the solution for all \n\nxanthan concentrations studied, but the duration of the annealing (heat-cooling scan or 1h at \n\na fixed temperature) was important only for the highly anisotropic solution. The addition of \n\nsucrose affected the rheological properties over all frequency range studied but only for \n\ninitially anisotropic or biphasic xanthan solutions. Sucrose probably played a role of \n\npromoting biopolymer intra-molecular aggregation for less concentrated solutions and by \n\nreducing the intermolecular junction zones in more concentrated solutions. \n\nKeywords: xanthan, sucrose, annealing temperature, isotropy / anisotropy \n\n \n\n1. Introduction \n\nXanthan is a high-molecular-weight anionic polysaccharide produced from the \n\nfermentation broths of the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris. This polysaccharide is used \n\nin wide variety of applications and it is a good stabilizer for food products (Capron et al., \n\n1998). The structure of this polymer consists of a linear (1-4)-?-D glucose backbone with a \n\ncharged trisaccharide side chain on every second glucose residue (Jansson et al., 1975). The \n\nsecondary conformation of xanthan molecule is known to undergo a conformational \n\ntransition (Tm) from helix to coil as the temperature is raised, which is also a function of \n\nionic strength of the solution, the nature of the electrolyte and the pH (Paradossi et al., \n\n1982). In addition, Lee and Brant (2002) observed a second transition that was attributed to \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 66\n\nan anisotropic-isotropic transition, which was dependent on solution temperature and \n\npolysaccharide concentration. \n\nAlthough xanthan is considered as a non-gelling hydrocolloid, some authors \n\n(Yoshida et al., 1998, Iseki et al., 2001) obtained hydrogels in solutions that were annealed \n\nat high temperature and subsequently cooled. It was suggested that the gelation phenomena \n\ntakes place after the formation of stable junction zones during heat treatment. Extensive \n\nwork has already been done to elucidate the temperature-induced transition of xanthan \n\nmolecules. Studies on the native and renatured structure have been mainly conducted by \n\nusing atomic force microscopy (AFM). The AFM sample preparation requires a dilute \n\nsolution and a drying step that proved to be good to elucidate the coil-helix transition \n\n(melting transition). However, few works were done with systems in the concentrated \n\nregime (Lee and Brant, 2002, Capron et al., 1998, Lim et al., 1984).  \n\nThe effect of the addition of some co-solutes, such as NaCl, on xanthan solutions is \n\nknown to strength the elastic characteristic of this polysaccharide (Lee and Brant, 2002). \n\nHowever, few works have studied the influence of low molecular weight sugars upon the \n\nproperties of hydrocolloids solutions (Richardson et al., 1998), although sucrose is widely \n\nused in the food industry. Basaran et al. (1999) studied the diffusion of sucrose (10-40 wt \n\n%) in xanthan solutions showing that xanthan did not affect this property. However, the \n\nrheological properties at high frequencies of a mixture of xanthan and a high sugar content \n\n(74-78 wt %) solutions showed that the polysaccharide acted retarding the mobility of \n\nsucrose molecules causing them to behave as in glassy state (Saggin and Coupland, 2004). \n\nHowever, for our knowledge there is no work that focuses on the effect of sucrose \n\nmolecules on the rheological behaviour of concentrated xanthan solutions. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 67\n\nThe aim of this work was to understand the effect of annealing temperature and \n\nsucrose addition on the rheological properties of concentrated xanthan solutions. In \n\naddition, the morphologies of such solutions were observed under light and atomic force \n\nmicroscopes in order to relate them to the temperature induced rheological transitions. \n\n \n\n2. Materials and Methods \n\n2.1. Material \n\nSucrose (Synth, Brazil) and xanthan gum, (Sigma-Aldrich Co., USA) were used to \n\nprepare the mixed systems. The xanthan powder showed moisture content of 8.36 \u00b1 0.23% \n\n(wt% wet basis), an average molecular weight (gel permeation chromatography) of 1795.4 \n\nkDa and the following cations content (atomic absorption spectroscopy): 2.6% Na+, 0.4% \n\nCa2+ and 4.0% K+. \n\n2.2. Preparation of Solutions \n\nXanthan solutions at different concentrations (Table 1) were prepared under \n\nmechanical stirring during 1 hour at different temperatures (10, 20, 50, 75, 80 and 90 \u00baC) \n\nand subsequently cooled to 10 \u00baC. An appropriate amount of sucrose (0, 7.5, 15% w/v) was \n\ngently mixed to xanthan solutions at 10 \u00baC. \n\nTable 1. Nomenclature used for xanthan solutions at different concentrations. \n\nXanthan concentration (%) 0.05 0.1 0.5 1 3.5 \n\nSample nomenclature  X005 X01 X05 X1 X35 \n\n \n\n2.3. Rheological Measurements \n\nOscillatory shear measurements were done using a stress-controlled rheometer \n\n(Carri-Med CSL2500, TA Instruments, England). Stainless steel cone and plate geometry of \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 68\n\n60 mm diameter was used and two types of experiments were performed. 1) Temperature \n\nsweeps were done at frequency of 0.1 Hz for solutions without sucrose and annealed at \n\n10\u00baC. The temperature was raised to 82 \u00baC at 1\u00baC/min and then lowered to 10\u00baC at the same \n\nrate. For the 0.05 and 0.1% xanthan concentrations, a frequency of 0.3 Hz and a rate of 3 \n\n\u00baC/min were used to improve the measurement sensibility. 2) Frequency sweeps were \n\ncarried out for all xanthan solutions and xanthan-sucrose mixtures, from 0.01 to 10 Hz at \n\n0.15 Pa and 10 \u00baC. The Lissajous figures at each temperature or frequency were plotted to \n\nensure that G\u2019 (storage modulus) and G\u201d (loss modulus) were always measured within the \n\nlinear viscoelastic regime. To prevent evaporation, samples were covered with a Newtonian \n\noil. \n\nThree different regions were observed in the complex viscosity (?*) \u2013 temperature \n\ncurve, being the transitions of the regions determined as following:  \n\n1) First transition (Ta): occurred at the end of the initial constant value of ?*, identified as \n\nanisotropic-biphasic temperature-induced transition; \n\n2) Second transition (Ti): at the sharp deflection of the slope of complex viscosity \u2013 \n\ntemperature curve. This temperature characterizes the transition between the biphasic to \n\nfully isotropic region. \n\n3) Third transition (Tm): it was associated to the helix-coil (melting) transition.

Specimens were \n\nexamined using an Autoprobe CPAFM from Thermomicroscopes (USA) operating in non-\n\ncontact mode. \n\n \n3. Results and Discussion \n\n3.1. Xanthan behaviour in water \n\nIt is known that xanthan molecule undergoes a temperature transition from double \n\nhelical form to a disordered form that is a function of ionic strength. The characteristic \n\ntemperature Tm is near room temperature for salt-free aqueous xanthan at low polymer \n\nconcentrations and increases to values well above 100\u00b0C in the presence of salt (Paradossi \n\net al., 1982, Paoletti et al., 1983, Capron et al., 1997). Figures 1a, 2a and 3a show the \n\nrheological behaviour of xanthan solutions in a temperature range of 10-80 \u00b0C for different \n\nsolution concentrations, such that Tm could be determined for a great range of polymer \n\nconcentration. The rheological behaviour was related to solutions micrographs shown in \n\nFigures 1b, 2b, 3b and 3c. The X005 sample showed a linear dependence of ?*(?) on \n\ntemperature over all range measured (Figure 1a), indicating that any temperature-induced \n\ntransition took place at concentrations lower than 0.05%. Figures 1c, 1d and 1e show the \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 70\n\nAFM micrographs of xanthan molecules present in X005 sample. It was observed flexible \n\nmolecules at 25 oC (Figures 1c and 1d) as well as molecular aggregates (Figure 1e). Similar \n\nloop-like and flexible structures were previously observed by Capron et al., 1998 for native \n\nxanthan solutions. It was difficult to observe isolated xanthan molecules, being more \n\ncommon the visualization of aggregates, which were formed during the drying process. \n\nThus, it was not possible to do a more accurate statistical quantitative analysis revealing the \n\ndimensions of the molecules.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1. a) Temperature dependence of ?*(?) for X005 (?) and X01 (?) on heating \n\n(closed symbols) and cooling (open symbols).

This solution did not emit any light when observed \n\nthrough polarized light (PL) microscopy indicating that it was fully isotropic. So, the only \n\ntransition that could take place at such concentration is the helix-coil one (Tm). Helix \n\nxanthan solutions have a higher relative viscosity than the more flexible disordered form \n\n(Lee and Brant, 2002). For X01 the complex viscosity decreases from 10\u00b0C to 60\u00b0C \n\nshowing that the helix-coil transition is a wide process over a range of 50\u00b0C (Figure 1a). \n\nThe increase of temperature cause a continuously change of the ordered form of the \n\nmolecule to a disordered form resulting in an intermediate conformation that consist of \n\ndisordered regions held together by a segment of ordered chains (Bordi et al., 1996, Capron \n\net al., 1997). From that behaviour the melting point was considered as a midpoint transition \n\nand determined to be 32 \u00baC. This value is in very good agreement with the value of 33 oC \n\nfound by Jones et al. (1987) and 35 oC reported by Bordi et al. (1996) for a 0.1% xanthan \n\nsolution. Figure 1b shows the DIC micrograph of X01 solution at 25 oC prior to the heating \n\nstep. It could be observed few small aggregates (<12.5 \u00b5m) probably formed by the double \n\nhelix molecules, being the solution quite homogeneous. \n\nFigure 2a shows the variation of ?*(?) with temperature for X05 and X1 samples, \n\nwhich were not anisotropic at 25\u00b0C as observed by a completely dark PL micrographs. For \n\nthose samples it was possible to observe three temperature-induced transitions. Lee and \n\nBrant (2002) also reported three transitions for more concentrated samples, being the \n\ntransition occurring at high temperature related to the well-known helix-coil transition. The \n\nfirst transition was referred as an anisotropic to biphasic transition (Ta), in which the \n\nsolution had initially a lyotropic characteristic and became a dispersion of anisotropic phase \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 72\n\nwithin an isotropic phase. The second was associated to the transition between the biphasic \n\nregion and the fully isotropic region (Ti). All transition temperatures (Ta, Ti and Tm) \n\nincreased with xanthan concentration, being the melting temperature calculated to be 52\u00baC \n\nand 68\u00baC for X05 and X1, respectively. The anisotropic transition (Ta) was associated with \n\nthe end of the first flat part of the curve, as will be discussed later, being the values for X05 \n\nand X1, respectively, 17\u00baC and 19\u00baC. The isotropic transition temperatures (Ti) were 33\u00b0C \n\nand 46\u00b0C, respectively, for X05 and X1. Figure 2b shows the DIC micrograph for X1 \n\nsolution at 25\u00b0C, being observed a higher amount of aggregates then those revealed in \n\nFigure 1b. However, most of the aggregates had the same size and some of them could \n\nreach up to 21 \u00b5m length.  \n\n  \n \n\nFigure 2. a) Temperature dependence of ?*(?) for X05 (?) and X1 (?) on heating (closed \n\nsymbols) and cooling (open symbols). b) DIC micrograph of the X1 sample at 25oC. Scale \n\nbar = 50 \u00b5m. \n\nFigure 3 shows the variation of complex viscosity with the temperature for X35 as \n\nwell as the corresponding DIC and PL micrographs at 25 oC. The X35 sample was \n\nanisotropic at 25\u00b0C even without the application of shear (Figure 3c). The PL micrograph \n\nshowed birefringence as the light was transmitted through two crossed polarizer disks. This \n\n(b) \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 73\n\nbehaviour was checked by rotating one of the polar by 45\u00b0, but maintaining them crossed. It \n\nwas observed a micrograph similar to that of Figure 3c but the black areas became white, \n\nwhile the white areas of Figure 3c became black. From that behaviour it could be \n\nestablished that the initial flat part of ?* curve (Figure 3a) is referred to the anisotropic \n\ndomain, being Ta for X35 equal 48\u00b0C. For that sample the isotropic transition (Ti) was \n\ndetermined to be 73\u00b0C. Lim et al. (1984) observed permanent birefringence in concentrated \n\nxanthan solutions (1 and 3%) under shear. However, in the present work the X1 sample did \n\nnot show birefringence probably because of the different xanthan sources. \n\n \n\n  \nFigure 3. a) Temperature dependence of ?*(?) for X35. b) DIC micrograph of the X35 \n\nsample at 25oC. c) Polarized (PL) micrographs of the X35 sample at 25oC.

Comparing the three DIC micrographs (Figures 1b, 2b and 3b) it is \n\npossible to observe that the amount of aggregates is only a function of the polymer \n\nconcentration. The optical birefringence was probably governed by the amount of those \n\naggregates, resulting in an anisotropic solution (Figure 3c). In addition, it was observed that \n\nat a fixed polymer concentration the aggregate size reduced as the temperature increased \n\nand they recovered their original size after cooling back to room temperature (result not \n\nshown). Thus, it could be suggested that the solution domain was a function of the amount \n\nand size of the aggregates. \n\nThe cooling curve showed a small thermal hysteresis for X01 and X005, which \n\nwere initially fully isotropic. At 10\u00b0C, the complex viscosity had the same value of the \n\ninitial solution (native). Thus, it could be supposed that the renatured form was the same of \n\nthe native one or that the solution concentration was not high enough to promote a network \n\nformation after the heating step. For X05 and X1 the complex viscosity values were smaller \n\nat the cooling cycle than on heating cycle. Thus, the isotropic transition caused some \n\nirreversible rearrangements on xanthan molecules that produced a less elastic solution at \n\n10\u00b0C than the initial anisotropic sample. On cooling below Tm the reassembly of chains \n\ngenerates an architecture which differs from the original one and depends on whether the \n\nheat treatment was performed on dilute or concentrated solution (Smith et al, 1981). For \n\nX35, the transition to isotropic domain occurred near the final temperature (82\u00b0C), being \n\nthe only sample where the final temperature of the sweep was lower than Tm. Thus, the \n\nmolecular rearrangements occurred mainly in the biphasic domain and the new \n\nentanglements were probably formed with double helix molecules. This kind of \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 75\n\nrearrangements (between helix molecules) revealed to be stronger than those that occurred \n\nfrom coil molecules. Capron et al. (1998) observed the same behaviour for a 2% xanthan \n\nsolution. These authors verified from AFM micrographs that at high polymer concentration \n\nthe double strands can form permanent associations with neighbouring molecules. \n\nHowever, dilute solutions showed mainly intramolecular associations instead of \n\nintermolecular organization. \n\nBraga and Cunha (2004) showed that xanthan solutions (0.1 to 1%) that were \n\nannealed at 20, 50 or 80\u00b0C and then cooled to 10\u00b0C presented different rheological \n\nbehaviour. In the present work the same behaviour was also observed for X35 (Figure 4d), \n\nsuch that the G* curve was shifted to lower values as the annealing temperature increased. \n\nBordi et al. (1996) did not observed any effect of the annealing performed at 50oC during \n\n1h of xanthan solutions (semi-diluted and concentrated regimes) on its conductomeric \n\nbehaviour. Such differences between the results could be attributed to the different \n\ntechniques used. Comparing the rheological results of Braga and Cunha (2004) for 0.5 and \n\n1% annealed xanthan solution with those of Figure 2a it can be seen a similar reduction of \n\ncomplex viscosity value at 10 oC between heating and cooling cycles. From such results it \n\nis possible to affirm that the less concentrated solutions have a renatured conformation \n\ndifferent to the native one just by increasing the temperature and cooling back, such that the \n\nannealing during 1h did not affect the rheological properties. However, for X35 the ?* of \n\nnon-annealed solution increased almost 2-fold after the cooling cycle (Figure 3a), while the \n\nannealed solution (Figure 4d) had a ?* value half of that found for native solution at 10\u00b0C. \n\nThus, the annealing up to 80\u00b0C during 1h hour modifies the renatured conformation for the \n\nhighly anisotropic xanthan solution (Figures 3c and 4d).  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 76\n\n3.2. Xanthan behaviour in sucrose solutions \n\nFigure 4 shows the effect of sucrose on the rheological properties (at 10\u00b0C) of \n\nxanthan solutions annealed at different temperatures during 1h. For samples with low \n\npolymer concentration (X01) the addition of sucrose did not affect the rheological \n\nproperties of the aqueous solution independent on the annealing temperature (Figure 4a). \n\nSimilar behaviour was observed for X05 when the solutions were annealed at 50\u00baC or \n\n80\u00baC/1h (Figure 4b). However, as sucrose concentration increased up to 15% the elastic \n\ncharacter of solutions annealed at 20\u00baC decreased by 15-20%. It is interesting to note that at \n\n20\u00baC xanthan solution was in the anisotropic region, at 50\u00baC the isotropic transition had \n\nalready occurred and at 80\u00baC the molecule had a coil conformation (Figure 2a). \n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n0.01 0.1 1\n?

Nevertheless, sucrose did not \n\ninfluence the rheological properties when solutions were annealed at 80\u00b0C, which \n\ncorresponded to a coil conformation in a fully isotropic domain (Figure 2a). The 1% \n\nxanthan solutions annealed at 20\u00b0C and 50\u00b0C were so affected by sucrose that their \n\nrheological properties became similar of those of a solution annealed at 80\u00b0C. Figure 4d \n\nshows that for X35 the addition of sucrose decreased the rheological properties of solutions \n\nannealed in a very broad range of temperature (10-75\u00b0C) and then cooled to 10\u00b0C. \n\nHowever, at a higher annealing temperature (90\u00b0C), in which the solution was in isotropic \n\ndomain, sucrose did not influenced G* at 10\u00b0C. From the above results it is possible to \n\nsuggest that sucrose only affected the rheological properties of solutions that were annealed \n\nat temperatures in which the solution was in the anisotropic or biphasic domain. \n\nTable 2 shows the magnitude (%) of the negative effect of sucrose on G* at two \n\ndifferent frequencies, 0.02 Hz and 1 Hz.

Thus, the sucrose \n\nseems to affect the dissociation/formation of xanthan assemblies. Launay et al. (1997) and \n\nGarcia et al. (2000) observed that the Huggins coefficient found for xanthan in 10% sucrose \n\naqueous solution were higher (>1) than those obtained in water. This means that 10% \n\naqueous sucrose solution is a bad solvent for xanthan and the molecule can be in a more \n\ncompacted form for the less concentrated systems, resulting in lower G* values. \n\nTable 2.

In more concentrated polysaccharide solutions the amount of \n\nfree water is reduced due to the well-known water binding capacity of xanthan. Thus, a \n\nfixed amount of added sucrose (eg. 15%) seems to act effectively as a more concentrated \n\nsucrose solution. In the presence of excess sucrose, the amount of free water necessary to \n\nform junction zones is reduced (Nishinari et al., 1990). The junction zones formed by the \n\ndissociation of the assemblies during the annealing could break more easily, resulting in a \n\nlower elasticity of the xanthan-sucrose solution as compared with the one without sucrose.  \n\n \n\n4. Conclusion \n\nXanthan solutions showed three different transitions from anisotropic-biphasic \n\ndomain, biphasic-isotropic region and helix-coil conformation that were dependent on \n\ntemperature and solution concentration. The latter was reversible only for concentrations \n\nlower than 0.1%. It was observed many birefringence aggregates by light microscope in the \n\nanisotropic and biphasic regions. The size and amount of those aggregates reduced with the \n\ntemperature increase and the concentration decrease, respectively. The temperature of \n\nannealing affected the elasticity of the solution for all xanthan concentrations, but the \n\nduration of the annealing (heat-cooling scan or 1h at a fixed temperature) was important \n\nonly for the highly anisotropic solution. The addition of sucrose affected the rheological \n\nproperties over all frequency range studied but only for initially anisotropic or biphasic \n\nxanthan solutions. Sucrose probably played a role of promoting biopolymer intra-molecular \n\naggregation for less concentrated solutions and by reducing the intermolecular junction \n\nzones in more concentrated solutions. \n\n \n\n5.

Protein-polysaccharide interactions in acidified gels \n\ncontaining Na-caseinate, SPI and/or xanthan \n\n1st PART: The effect of the GDL/caseinate ratio on sodium caseinate gelation  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(in collaboration with CBMEG-IB-UNICAMP)\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n 85\n\nAbstract \n\nThe influence of the acidification rate and of final pH on the properties of sodium caseinate \n\ngels (2-6% w/v) prepared by acidification with glucono-?-lactone (GDL) at 10\u00baC was \n\ninvestigated. The rheological properties of the systems were analysed under shear at \n\nincipient gelation and under uniaxial compression throughout the entire gelation process. \n\nThe water holding capacity (WHC) of these gels and their amount of soluble protein in \n\ndifferent media were also evaluated. Up to ~50% of the total ?-casein content was soluble \n\nin gels with higher amount of GDL, and this contributed to the high WHC observed under \n\nthis condition. The acidification rate did not affect the rheological properties measured \n\nunder shear, but the GDL/caseinate ratio used had a significant effect on the steady state \n\nproperties. Fast acidification resulted in lower Young modulus and stress at fracture values, \n\nbut higher residual stress values and relaxation times. In contrast, slow acidification \n\nproduced a more interconnected network, probably because of the extensive reorganization \n\nor rearrangement within the segments near the isoelectric point. \n\nKeywords: acidification rate, gel, glucono-?-lactone, sodium caseinate. \n\n \n\n1. Introduction \n\nMilk is a colloidal emulsion of protein particles, with casein being the main protein \n\n(~80%). Four main types of casein, ?S1-,?S2-, ?- and ?-casein, can be distinguished in milk \n\nand are present in a mass ratio of about 4:1:4:1.3. All casein in milk occurs in micelles, \n\nwhich are fairly large particles of colloidal size (Walstra &amp; Jenness, 1984). However, the \n\nmicellar structure of casein is destroyed during the manufacture of sodium caseinate \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n 86\n\n(Kinsella, 1984). Na-caseinate is an ingredient widely used in a range of food formulations \n\nbecause of its nutritional value and functional properties, such as its gelling capacity. \n\nA gel structure is formed during milk/caseinate acidification as a result of the \n\ndissociation and aggregation of casein fractions. The two acidification processes used in the \n\ndairy industry result in a slow reduction of pH that can require more than 15 h (Lucey, \n\nTamehana, Singh &amp; Munro, 1998). In the traditional process, milk is acidified by bacteria, \n\nwhich ferment lactose to lactic acid. A second process that has gained the attention of food \n\nindustry is direct acidification by the addition of lactone, such as glucono-?-lactone (GDL). \n\nGDL is an internal ester that spontaneously hydrolyzes to form gluconic acid and has first-\n\norder reaction hydrolysis kinetics (de Kruif, 1997). The use of GDL avoids some of the \n\ndifficulties associated with starter bacteria, such as variable activity and variation with the \n\ntype of culture used. In addition, during gelation with GDL, the final pH of the system is a \n\nfunction of the amount of lactone added, whereas starter bacteria produce acid until they \n\nare inhibited by the low pH (Lucey et al., 1998). \n\nRheology is a powerful tool for analyzing the different steps involved in milk \n\nclotting and in gel formation, and for assessing the texture of the final product. Mechanical \n\nproperties may be related to sensory texture and have been determined by empirical or \n\nfundamental methods. The benefit of using fundamental rheological methods to evaluate \n\nthe mechanical elements of texture is that they can be linked to theories that explain \n\nmolecular mechanisms. These theories could describe the food and predict the influence of \n\nvarious elements of the food or process conditions on the final product. However, models to \n\npredict complex systems, such as dairy foods, need to be modified continuously in order to \n\nfit the food texture more closely. The use of simplified model systems is very important for \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n 87\n\nproviding a scientific framework (Foegeding, Brown, Drake &amp; Daubert, 2003). The most \n\nimportant factors controlling the rheological properties of acid-induced caseinate gels are \n\nthe protein content, the pH, the ionic strength and the presence of other components (de \n\nKruif, 1997; Chen, Dickinson &amp; Edwards, 1999). \n\nThe purpose of this work was to evaluate the effect of the acidification rate and of \n\nthe final pH on sodium caseinate gelation and the gel properties at steady state. Different \n\namounts of glucono-?-lactone was added to Na-caseinate solutions and the rheological \n\nproperties were measured under shear and compression during gelation. In addition, the \n\neffect of the amount of GDL on the steady state gel network properties was assessed by the \n\nwater holding capacity (WHC), uniaxial compression, protein solubility and gel \n\nelectrophoresis. \n\n \n\n2. Material and methods \n\n2.1. Material \n\nThe ingredients used to prepare the model systems were casein and glucono-?-\n\nlactone (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO). The casein powder was characterized by \n\natomic absorption (AA) spectroscopy in the Institute of Chemistry at UNICAMP, and the \n\nfollowing composition of ions was obtained: Na=0.16%, Ca=0.14% e K=0.08%. The \n\nprotein (N x 6.38), ash and moisture content of the casein powder were 88.2 \u00b1 0.9%, 0.84 \u00b1 \n\n0.08% and 6.5 \u00b1 0.1% (wet basis), respectively. \n\n2.2. Preparation of solutions and gels \n\nSodium caseinate solutions were prepared by dissolving the casein powder in \n\ndeionised water at a maximum temperature of 50oC, with magnetic stirring for 2 h. Sodium \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n 88\n\nhydroxide (10 M) was added to keep the pH at 6.7. Different amounts of GDL were added \n\nto the sodium caseinate solutions at 10\u00baC and the mixture then poured into the rheometer or \n\ninto cylindrical plastic tubes (30 mm in diameter and 30 mm height) for gel formation. The \n\nrheological properties during gelation at 10\u00baC were obtained by oscillatory shear \n\nmeasurements up to the gel point, and by compression tests up to steady state (~3 days). In \n\naddition, the WHC, protein solubility, electrophoresis and compression tests were done 4 \n\ndays after the addition of GDL. The pH of the gels was monitored during the entire process. \n\nThe caseinate concentrations used to prepare the gels ranged from 2 to 6%. The \n\nconcentration of GDL used in each formulation depended on GDL/caseinate ratio, which \n\nwas 0.14, 0.16 or 0.18. For rheological oscillatory measurements, a ratio of 0.36 was also \n\nused to obtain faster acidification. \n\n2.3. Gel properties measurements \n\n2.3.1. Rheological oscillatory measurements \n\nThe oscillatory shear measurements were done using a stress-controlled rheometer \n\n(Carri-Med CSL2500, TA Instruments, England). Time sweep measurements were done \n\nduring the gelation process at 10\u00baC, 0.1 Hz and 0.1 Pa. A double wall concentric cylinder \n\nwas used and the external diameter of the rotating bob was 21.96 mm, while the internal \n\ndiameter was 20.38 mm. The stationary cylinder had an internal diameter of 20 mm and an \n\nexternal diameter of 22.38 mm. The Lissajous figures at various times were plotted to \n\nensure that the measurements of G\u2019 (storage modulus) and G\u201d (loss modulus) were always \n\nobtained within the linear viscoelastic region. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n 89\n\n2.3.2. Mechanical properties and pH \n\nThe decay in pH caused by GDL hydrolysis was measured using a Sentron 2001 pH \n\nmeter (Sentron Inc., USA) equipped with an electrode calibrated at the reaction temperature \n\nover the pH range from 7.0 to 4.0. Uniaxial compression experiments were done using a \n\nTA-XT2i texture analyser (Stable Microsystems Ltd., England) equipped with an acrylic \n\ncylindrical plate (35 mm diameter). All measurements were done in triplicate at 10\u00baC and \n\nthe fracture test was done throughout all the gelation process up to the steady state. The \n\nstress relaxation test was done only at steady state (4 days after the addition of GDL). \n\nFor rupture tests, gels were compressed to 80% of their original height using a \n\ncrosshead speed of 1 mm/s. The force and height values were transformed into Hencky \n\nstress (?H) \u2013 Hencky strain (?H) curves (Steffe, 1996). The rupture properties (stress and \n\nstrain) were obtained from the maximum point of the stress-strain curve, while the Young \n\nmodulus was the slope of the initial linear region of this curve. The stress relaxation \n\nmeasurements were done within the non-linear viscoelastic region because the gels showed \n\nsome syneresis during the test. These measurements were done during 7 min with an initial \n\ncrosshead speed of 7 mm/s. The Peleg empirical correlation (Peleg, 1979) was used to fit \n\nthe experimental data, with the relaxation time and the residual stress being obtained as \n\nresponses. \n\n2.3.3. Water holding capacity of gels \n\nA disc of gel (1.5-2.0 g), equilibrated at room temperature, was cut into two pieces. \n\nEach piece was placed on a disc of Whatmann # 1 filter paper (Maidstone, U.K.) and \n\npositioned in the middle position of a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Water loss was determined in \n\ntriplicate by weighing the gel before and after centrifugation at 173 g for 10 min (Ikeda &amp; \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n 90\n\nFoegeding, 1999) in a T62.1 centrifuge (VEB MLW Medizintechnik Leipzig, Germany). \n\nThe WHC values were calculated using Equation 1:  \n\n( ) ( )( ) ?\n?\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n??=\n\nggelWater\nglossWater1100%WHC  (1) \n\nwhere Watergel is the amount of water in the gel before centrifugation. \n\n2.3.4. Protein solubility of gels \n\nSamples were dispersed either in distilled water (pH 8.0) or in a pH 8.0 buffer \n\n(0.086 M Tris, 0.09 M glycine and 4 mM Na2EDTA) (Lupano, Dumay &amp; Cheftel 1992; \n\nShimada &amp; Cheftel, 1988). Samples (8.5 mg protein/mL) were homogenized at room \n\ntemperature with an Ultra Turrax model T18 basic homogenizer (IKA, Germany) for 2 min \n\nand then centrifuged (F0850-rotor, AllegraTM 64R Beckman, USA) at 20,000 x g for 15 \n\nmin at 25\u00b0C. Protein solubility was determined in triplicate from supernatants and \n\nexpressed as 100 x protein content in the supernatant / total protein content. Three \n\nindependent extractions were done with each solvent. Protein concentrations were \n\ndetermined at 280 nm in a Beckmann Du-70 spectrophotometer (Beckmann, USA) using an \n\napparent extinction coefficient ( mLmgcmE\n/1\n\n1 ) of 0.947 for proteins dispersed in water and \n\n0.942 for Tris buffer. The extinction coefficients were obtained by measuring the \n\nabsorbance at 280 nm of a 1 mg/mL soy protein solution, the concentration of which was \n\ndetermined by the Kjeldhal method. \n\n2.3.5. Electrophoresis of proteins \n\nUrea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was done using the method of \n\nAndrews (1983) with minor modifications. Solutions with soluble proteins from gels \n\n(extracted in water and Tris buffer) were diluted with an equal volume of a pH 6.0 buffer [3 \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n 91\n\nmL of stacking buffer (pH 6.7; 0.062 M Tris-HCl + 7 M urea); 2 mL of 87% glycerol; and \n\n0.1 mL of ?-mercaptoethanol]. Samples (10 \u00b5L of a solution at 1.5 mg/mL) were loaded \n\nonto the gel. The gels were run at 200 V in a Mini Cell Protean electrophoresis unit (Biorad \n\nLaboratories, USA) and then stained with 0.25% (v/v) Comassie Brilliant Blue, in \n\nethanol:acetic acid:water (45:10:45, v/v) followed by distaining with acetic \n\nacid:ethanol:water (5:10:85, v/v). \n\n2.4. Statistical analysis \n\nThe results were evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the software \n\nStatistica (5.0 version, USA), with the sources of variation being the caseinate \n\nconcentration and the GDL/caseinate ratio. \n\n2.4.1. Mechanical properties and pH during gelation \n\nA full factorial design was used to evaluate the influence of caseinate and GDL on \n\ngelation. Table 1 shows the range of concentrations used in the 22 factorial design, as well \n\nas the abbreviations that will be used in the Results and Discussion sections. The most \n\nimportant effects associated with the response variables (pH, Young modulus and stress \n\nand strain at fracture) were evaluated. The mathematical models that predicted the gel \n\nproperties as a function of the variables studied were considered valid if Fcalc/Ftab>1. \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n 92\n\nTable 1.

Results \n\n3.1. Gelation process \n\nThe G\u2019-G\u201d crossover times (tg) of acidified Na-caseinate systems (Table 2) were \n\nconsidered here as the gel time since most studies of milk/caseinate gelation have adopted \n\nthis criterion (Curcio, Gabriele, Giordano, Calabr\u00f2, de Cindio &amp; Iorio, 2001) or similar \n\nones (Lucey, van Vliet, Grolle, Geurts &amp; Walstra, 1997; Horne, 2003). The gelation time \n\nvaried from ~100 to ~710 min, depending on the system (Table 2). The variation \n\ncoefficient of the gel time was about 15% for gels with GDL/caseinate ratio of 0.18 and \n\n0.36 and lower than 10%, when the ratio was 0.14 or 0.16. The pH at this point (pHg) was \n\nabout 5.0\u20135.1 for all systems. A similar pH was reported by Lucey et al. (1997) for \n\nacidified Na-caseinate gels (pH ~5.1) and by Roefs and van Vliet (1990) for the gelation of \n\nmilk (pH ~5.0). The gel time (tg) decreased by about 80-85% as the GDL/protein ratio \n\nincreased from 0.14 to 0.36, for a given amount of caseinate. This marked variation can be \n\nattributed mainly to the first order degradation kinetics of GDL, in which gluconic acid \n\n(weak acid) is constantly produced and the back-reaction is negligible (de Kruif, 1997). \n\nBecause the same amount of H+ is needed to attain the caseinate clotting in all samples \n\n(similar pHg), an increase in the GDL concentration reduced the gel time. A similar trend \n\ntowards a reduction in gel time was observed as the protein concentration increased from \n\n2% to 6% and the acidogen/protein ratio was maintained constant. However, in this case, \n\nthe decrease in gelation time was 20-35%, indicating that the gel time was also governed by \n\nthe association/dissociation of casein particles, which depends on the change in the ionic \n\nand solubility characteristics of the casein molecules (de Kruif, 1997). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n 94\n\nTable 2.

The gelation profile in Figure 1A was plotted against \n\nthe reduced time, t/tg, shifting the data along the horizontal axis in order to eliminate the \n\neffect of the kinetics of GDL hydrolysis. At the gel point, the values of G* were similar \n\n(around 0.1 Pa) and thereafter all curves showed a monotonic increase in G* with time \n\n(Figure 1A). Reducing the caseinate concentration resulted in a slower initial rate of G* \n\ngrowth, such that at a given reduced time (t/tg = 1.075) G* was ~10 Pa, ~30 Pa and ~70 Pa \n\nfor 2%, 4% and 6% caseinate gels, respectively. For each caseinate concentration, the plots \n\nfell on a single master curve. Figure 1B shows the changes in tan ? as a function of the \n\nreduced time for sodium caseinate solutions acidified with GDL. Two systems for each Na-\n\ncaseinate concentration (GDL/caseinate ratios of 0.14 and 0.18) were chosen to illustrate \n\nthe tan ? profile since the other formulations showed the same pattern. The profile shows an \n\ninitial fast reduction in the tan ? values (up to t/tg = 1.01), followed by a steady decrease to \n\nabout 0.25 at the end of the oscillatory tests. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n 95\n\n \n\nFigure 1.

At this \n\ntime, all gels were self-supporting. The Young modulus values increased as a function of \n\ntime (Figure 3A), in a manner similar to the profile for stress at fracture (results not shown), \n\nwhereas the strain at fracture (Figure 3B) decreased with time. For each property, the \n\nprofiles could be divided into three groups of formulations (Cn, Cc, Cp) that were \n\ndependent on the caseinate concentration. A positive correlation was observed between the \n\ncaseinate content and gel properties at all times, thus indicating that these samples were \n\nmore elastic, hard and firm. In addition, the higher the caseinate content the greater the \n\nchanges in the Young modulus (Figure 3A) and stress at fracture values (data not shown) as \n\na function of time. Such behaviour was not observed for strain at fracture (Figure 3B). The \n\nvalues of samples with a low GDL content (CnGn and CpGn) became greater than those \n\nwith a high GDL/caseinate ratio during gelation, which indicated the formation of a harder \n\nand firmer structure. The properties of all gels still changed after periods >30 h (1,800 min). \n\nIn addition, the Young modulus and stress at fracture reached the steady state faster as the \n\nGDL/caseinate ratio increased.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 0 1000 2000 3000 4000\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nY\no\n\nu\nn\n\ng\n m\n\no\nd\n\nu\nlu\n\ns \n(k\n\nP\na\n\n)\n\nTime (min)\n\n(A) \n\nCp \n\nCc \n\nCn \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n 97\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.

The rate of decrease in pH (k-pH) was dependent on the \n\ncaseinate concentration and the GDL/caseinate ratio.

Gel properties at steady state \n\nThe steady state properties of acid gels as a function of the GDL/caseinate ratio used \n\nare shown in Figure 5. No stress relaxation behaviour was observed for 2% Na-caseinate \n\ngels because of the spontaneous syneresis within the measurement cell after the initial fast \n\nuniaxial compression required for this test. Consequently, the gel lost its mechanical \n\ncontact with the cell wall and the measured force dropped to zero (Merino, Lau &amp; \n\nDickinson, 2004). The residual stress (Figure 5A) was positively influenced by the GDL \n\nconcentration in high protein gels. These values ranged between 0.08-0.12, but were about \n\n0.04 for 4% protein gels, thus showing that the caseinate concentration affected this \n\nresponse. The GDL concentration had a positive effect on the relaxation time (Figure 5B) \n\nof 4% protein gels, with values ranging from 6 s to 10 s. \n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nCaseinate GDL/CaseinateE\nff\n\nec\nt \n\nes\ntim\n\nat\ne \n\nx \n10\n\n3  \n(a\n\nbs\nol\n\nut\ne \n\nva\nlu\n\nes\n) k - pH k - Stress k - Young modulus\n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n 99\n\nThe mechanical properties of the gels (Figure 5C, 5D and 5E) were significantly \n\ninfluenced by the caseinate concentration. The stress at fracture (Figure 5C), Young \n\nmodulus (Figure 5D) and the strain at fracture (Figure 5E) showed values of 500-5,000 Pa, \n\n1,500-6,500 Pa and 0.2-0.5, respectively; the strain at fracture was the property least \n\naffected by the caseinate concentration. However, the effect of the GDL/caseinate ratio \n\nused was dependent on the response and on the amount of protein. The strain at fracture \n\n(Figure 5E) was not influenced by the GDL concentration at all protein concentrations. An \n\nincrease in the GDL concentration tended to reduce the Young modulus and the stress at \n\nfracture of caseinate gels. However, the mechanical property obtained at small deformation \n\n(Figure 5D) showed large deviations for high protein gels and resulted in statistically \n\nsimilar values for 2% and 6% caseinate concentrations. The WHC increased from 10% to \n\n50% as the caseinate concentration increased from 2% to 6%. An increase in the amount of \n\nGDL/g of protein also increased the capacity of 4% and 6% caseinate gels to retain water \n\nwithin the network. However, the effect of the amount of GDL was not as strong as that \n\nobtained with variations in the protein content since of the WHC values increased from \n\n25% to 30% for 4% protein gels and from ~40 to 50% for 6% protein gels (Figure 5F). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n 100\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \nFigure 5.

Lane 1 (control) shows the typical electrophoretic \n\nprofile of a sodium-caseinate solution (pH 6.7) with three major casein bands (?, ? and ?-\n\ncasein). The low intensity ?-casein band was difficult to observe, while ? and ?-casein \n\nshowed diffuse bands. This variation in intensity reflected the different proportion of each \n\nfraction present in the sodium-caseinate solution, and it was necessary to load concentrated \n\nsamples in order to observe the ?-casein band. The electrophoretic profile of the water-\n\nsoluble protein (lanes 2 and 3) differed from that of the Tris-soluble protein (lanes 4 and 5) \n\nin that only the ?-casein band was seen, whereas lanes 4 and 5 showed all of the bands seen \n\nwith the sodium caseinate solution (pH 6.7). These findings agreed with the absorbance \n\nresults that indicated 100% protein solubility in Tris buffer. The distribution of the ?-casein \n\nband seen in lanes 2 and 3 was very broad. Pepper and Farrell (1982) and Farrell et al. \n\n(1996) reported that ?-casein in whole casein exists as disulfide-bonded polymers with a \n\nwide size distribution. The pattern of ?-casein band observed here probably resulted from \n\nthe dissociation of this casein fraction into lower molecular weight aggregates because of \n\nthe ?-mercaptoethanol used in the electrophoresis buffer. \n\n \n\n4. Discussion \n\nIn this study, different GDL/caseinate ratios were used in order to obtain fast and \n\nlow rates of acidification and also different gel pH values at steady state. Figures 1 and 3 \n\nindicate that the gelation profile was more sensitive to the caseinate concentration than to \n\nthe GDL/caseinate ratio used. Two distinct stages were involved in the gelation process \n\npromoted by GDL (Chen &amp; Dickinson, 2000): the initial setting up of the gel network \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n 103\n\n(Figure 1), and subsequent development through bond strengthening and/or local \n\nrearrangements (Figure 3).  \n\nAt the start of gelation (?tg), the increase in G* probably reflected the increased \n\ncontact between the caseins mediated by particle fusion and interparticle rearrangements \n\nthat can occur even before gelation (Mellema, Walstra, van Opheusden &amp; van Vliet, \n\n2002b). The structural characteristics of the gels were very similar for the different \n\nGDL/caseinate ratios used at each caseinate concentration since all of the G* versus t/tg \n\nplots fell on a single master curve (Figure 1A). However, the presence of different amounts \n\nof protein affected the rate of gelation (as indicated by the slope of the G* curves) and the \n\ngel elasticity (as indicated by the values of G* at a given reduced time). During the initial \n\nstage of the acidification process, a substantial repulsive force remains between particles so \n\nthat particles may collide many times before sticking (Martin &amp; Adolf, 1991). Thus, the \n\nprotein effect was observed probably because the contact between particles was favoured \n\ndue to a great number of molecules. All gels had similar values of loss tangent as a function \n\nof reduced time (Figure 1B). This means that the ratio of the amount of energy dissipated \n\nby relaxation of the protein-protein bonds relative to the amount of elastic energy stored in \n\nsmall distortions of the protein-protein bonds was independent of the protein content and \n\nthe GDL/caseinate ratio. The different effects of the amount of protein on the G* and tan ? \n\nvalues indicated that the dynamics of the casein strands were similar (similar tan ?), but that \n\nthere was a greater number of strands (network connections) in more concentrated protein \n\ngels, such that the network elasticity was dependent on the amount of protein present. \n\nThe rate of acidification of caseinate solutions may affect the dissociation of \n\ncaseins, the rate of aggregation, and the time available for rearrangement of the aggregating \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n 104\n\nprotein particles (Lucey et al., 1998), thereby resulting in different gel steady state \n\nproperties. A high GDL/protein ratio reduces the gelation time, but also causes \u201cover-\n\nacidification\u201d (pH<pI) (Chen et al., 1999; Dickinson &amp; Merino, 2002). In the present work \n\nthe final pH ranged from 4.1 to 4.5 for GDL/caseinate ratio of 0.18 to 0.14, respectively. \n\nFigure 6A shows that a small amount of proteins was not bound in the caseinate network, \n\nand corresponded to ?-casein (Figure 6B). Because of its higher isoelectric point (pI 5.3-\n\n5.8), ?-casein would be more soluble at pH ~4.1-4.5 than ?- or ?- casein (pI 4.2 and 4.7 \n\nrespectively; Hudson, 1984). This soluble fraction was present in a small amount because \n\nof its low concentration (12.7%) in the original sodium-caseinate (Walstra &amp; Jenness, \n\n1984). However, a dissociation of 46.7% of the total ?-casein was obtained in 6% caseinate \n\ngels acidified with the highest amount of GDL. This amount was determined by the \n\nabsorbance analysis, considering that all soluble protein in water extract was ?-casein \n\n(lanes 2-3 of Figure 6B). Thus, this \u201cover-acidification\u201d and consequently different degrees \n\nof ?-casein dissociation and final gel pH is another point to be affecting the gel steady state \n\nproperties. \n\nBy analysing more than one property, it was easier to understand the overall \n\nstructural characteristics of the gel. The significant (p<0.15) differences associated with the \n\namount of GDL used were not observed for all caseinate concentrations partly because of \n\nvariations in the accuracy of the different techniques employed (Figure 5). The mechanical \n\nproperties were explored by investigating the change in stress as a function of the strain \n\nunder uniaxial compression. A gradual increase in strain resulted in a proportional increase \n\nin sample stress (linear viscoelastic range) during the initial stages. In general, particulated \n\ngels have a much shorter linear region than cross-linked polymer gels, and this complicates \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n 105\n\nthe measurement of Young modulus. Because of the high deviations associated with this \n\nanalysis, a negative effect of GDL concentration on this property was observed only for 4% \n\ncaseinate gels, while the stress at fracture showed the same tendency for 4% and 6% protein \n\ngel. The shorter ageing time near the isoelectric point of casein, when a high amount of \n\nGDL was used, could partly explain the lower mechanical properties of the gels (Figures \n\n5C and 5D). The longer ageing time seen near the isoelectric point when using low amounts \n\nof GDL may contribute to the continued fusion and rearrangement of casein particles and \n\nresult in a highly interconnected network (Lucey et al., 1997). The weaker network could \n\nalso be attributed to the lower pH (Figure 3), since beyond the isoelectric point (pI) the \n\nrepulsive electrostatic forces overcome the net attractive forces and some ?-casein was \n\ndissociated of the network. However, those properties might have been more affected by \n\nthe rate of acidification. \n\nThe relaxation properties of the gels as a function of the amount of GDL showed a \n\nresponse that was opposite to that of the Young modulus and stress at fracture. Both the \n\nresidual stress and relaxation time showed a general tendency to increase with increasing \n\namounts of GDL, thus indicating that this network was more elastic. One possible \n\nexplanation for this contradictory effect of the amount of GDL on the network properties \n\ncould be because of the time scale of the applied deformation taking also into consideration \n\nthe geometry of the network (straight or a curved strand) (Bremer, Bijsterbosch, Schrijvers, \n\nvan Vliet &amp; Walstra, 1990; Mellema, van Opheusden &amp; van Vliet, 2002a). Gels with \n\ncurved strands may have a higher residual stress than those with less curved strands \n\nbecause they can support greater deformations for long time or store a higher amount of \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n 106\n\nelastic energy. However, when applying a continuous deformation until the fracture some \n\nfragile points of the curved strands can be responsible for the low stress at fracture. \n\nThe increase in the WHC of the gels with increasing amount of GDL was apparently \n\nmore related to the amount of dissociated ?-casein than to the network dynamics. Slow \n\ngelation produced gels with a lower capacity to retain water. Although, faster acidification \n\nis often considered to lead to the formation of coarser networks (Lucey et al., 1998). The \n\nincreased dissociation of ?-casein as the pH was lower than pI could also be contributing to \n\nthe high WHC. The dissociated fraction increased by about 2-fold (from 14.1% to 29.5%) \n\nfor gels with 4% protein and by about 3-fold (from 15.7% to 46.7%) for 6% caseinate gels \n\nas the GDL/caseinate ratio increased from 0.14 to 0.18. Thus, the positive effect of the \n\namount of GDL on the WHC could also be explained by an increase in protein-water \n\naffinity. \n\n \n\n5. Conclusions \n\nThe results of this study show that an adequate interpretation of the dynamics of the \n\ncaseinate network requires the use of different techniques. In general, all of the properties \n\nassociated with gelation were affected by the caseinate concentration, whereas the effect of \n\nthe GDL/caseinate ratio depended on the time scale analysed. At the start of gelation, the \n\nGDL/caseinate ratio did not influence the rheological properties obtained under shear, but \n\naffected the rate of change in pH and in stress at fracture after the gel point. The steady \n\nstate mechanical and relaxation properties seemed to be governed by the rate of \n\nacidification. The gel obtained with fast acidification was weaker at rupture but had a \n\nhigher capacity to store elastic energy. In contrast, slow acidification yielded a hard, firm \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n 107\n\nnetwork, probably because of extensive reorganization or rearrangement within the \n\nsegments. The addition of high GDL/caseinate ratio produced gels with a greater capacity \n\nto retain water that was mainly attributed to the high degree of ?-casein dissociation at the \n\nlower pH. \n\n \n\n6.

Protein-polysaccharide interactions in acidified gels \n\ncontaining Na-caseinate, SPI and/or xanthan \n\n2nd PART: Small- and large-strain rheological properties of GDL-induced soy \n\nprotein isolate gels: effect of gelation temperature and xanthan addition.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 113\n\nAbstract \n\nThe linear, non-linear and fracture properties of GDL (glucono-?-lactone)-induced tofu \n\nmodel systems were studied as a function of protein content, xanthan addition and \n\nacidification temperature. The decrease of the breaking stress or strain could be obtained by \n\ndecreasing the SPI concentration in pure gels or by increasing the protein concentration in \n\ngels made with xanthan. Another option for the latter gels would be the increase of \n\nacidification temperature. It was proposed a new equation based on BST-equation (Blatz et \n\nal., Trans. Soc. Rheol. 18, (1974) 145) to obtain a greater number of mechanical properties \n\nof gels. Two more parameters could be predicted as compared to BST equation namely, 1) \n\nstress at fracture, 2) strain at fracture. In addition, the Young modulus (E) and the elasticity \n\nparameter (n) were also predicted. The behaviour of SPI gels under compression was well \n\ndescribed by the proposed equation and the predicted mechanical properties did not showed \n\nsignificantly (p<0.05) differences from the experimental true stress and Hencky strain at \n\nfracture. In addition, the correlation between n and fracture parameters was very \n\ninteresting, since it enables the manipulation of the breaking stress and strain of the gel.  \n\n \n\n1. Introduction \n\nTypical food proteins of interest for the industry include those derived from milk, \n\nsoy, fish and egg, which are used in a number of food products. Soy proteins are the most \n\nimportant representative of legume proteins due to their high protein level and well-\n\nbalanced amino-acid composition (Van Vliet et al., 2002). The most recognized soy food \n\nproduct in the world is tofu and the manufacturers are concerned with the yield, which is of \n\neconomic importance, and texture that determines its acceptability (Abd Karim et al., \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 114\n\n1999). Tofu is traditionally made by the addition of calcium sulphate or glucono-?-lactone \n\n(GDL), which are used as coagulants (Abd Karim et al., 1999). \n\nThe functional properties of soy protein isolates (SPI) reflect the composition and \n\nstructure of their globulins, which correspond to 50 \u2013 90% of the total proteins (Utsumi, et \n\nal., 1984). The soy protein fractions can be classified by their sedimentation constants, \n\nshowing approximate Svedberg coefficients of 2S, 7S, 11S and 15S. The two major \n\nglobulins in soybeans are ?-conglycinin and glycinin, also called 7S and 11S, respectively. \n\nThe glycinin subunits consist of two polypeptide components linked via disulfide bonds \n\n(AB), one with acidic (A) and the other with basic (B) isoelectric points (Staswick et al., \n\n1984). ?-conglycinin is a trimeric glycoprotein consisting of at least six combinations of \n\nthree subunits: ?, ?\u2019 and ? (Thanh &amp; Shibasaki, 1977). \n\nIn spite of the increasing demand for food products containing soy protein, very \n\nlittle is known about the interactions of soy proteins with other ingredients in foods. Some \n\nstudies have been conducted on the addition of polysaccharides to tofu in order to enhance \n\nthe gel properties. The addition of both, carrageenan (Abd Karim et al., 1999) and chitosan \n\n(Chang et al., 2003) increased the water holding capacity, although they had different \n\neffects on the mechanical properties of tofu made with GDL. However, the studies about \n\nthe interactions between soy protein and xanthan were done only for heat-induced gels \n\n(Hua et al., 2003, Braga et al., 2006a) or foams (Carp et al., 1999). The application of heat-\n\ninduced gelation on globular proteins has limitations or is not always desired (Barbut and \n\nFoegeding, 1993). In contrast, cold gelation is easier to control, more efficient and an \n\nadvantage might be that heat-labile or volatile compounds can be added (in the gelation \n\nstep) without any losses or off-flavor occurring. However, this process is more complex \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 115\n\nthan the heat-induced gelation one and also results in new attractive textures (Weijers et al., \n\n2006).  \n\nWhen a gel-type food is consumed, the perception of texture can be in part \n\nexplained by its mechanical properties (Li et al., 1999). The mechanical properties have \n\nbeen determined by empirical or fundamental methods and the use of simplified model \n\nsystems is very important for providing a scientific framework (Foegeding et al., 2003). \n\nUniaxial compression measurements up to rupture can provide information about the \n\nmechanical properties at small and large deformations. The former gives the elasticity \n\nmodulus (Young modulus) that is obtained from the slope of the initial linear region of the \n\nstress-strain curve. The latter is associated to the fracture properties, being the fracture \n\nstress and strain that reflect, respectively, hardness and deformability of gels.  \n\nHowever, the non-linear region, between the linear region and fracture, is still \n\nrelatively ill understood. Phenomenological models have been applied to large-strain \n\nbehavior in attempts to quantify the extent of non-linearity, or deviation from ideal elastic \n\nbehavior (Blatz et al., 1974; Peleg, 1984). The BST equation (Blatz et al., 1974) has been \n\nmost recently applied to biopolymer gels to describe and quantify non-linear behavior, but \n\nthe interpretation of the parameters estimated from this model have varied (Bot et al., 1996; \n\nGroot et al., 1996). Recently, Barrangou et al. (2006) suggested a new polynomial equation \n\nto describe the non-linear region of gels and reported a better data fit for agarose gels than \n\nthe one obtained by using BST equation. However, both models describe the linear and \n\nnon-linear behaviours only up to the fracture point, but the mechanical properties at fracture \n\ncan not be predicted. \n\nThe objectives of this work were (1) to develop a model that could predict a greater \n\nnumber of mechanical properties, including the linear, non-linear and fracture properties. \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 116\n\nFor that purpose, it was used the BST equation that describes two parameters (Young \n\nmodulus and non-linear elasticity); (2) to evaluate the effects of xanthan addition and \n\nacidification temperature (reaction rate) on the mechanical properties of GDL-SPI gels. \n\n \n2. Material and methods \n\n2.1. Materials \n\nThe ingredients used to prepare the model systems were xanthan and glucono-?-\n\nlactone (GDL) obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (USA) and soy protein isolate (SPI) \n\nproduced from defatted soy flour (Bunge Alimentos S.A., Brazil). The protein, ash and \n\nmoisture content of the SPI and xanthan powder are shown in Table 1. \n\nTable 1.

Preparation of soy protein isolate \n\nDefatted soy flour was dispersed in distilled water (1:10 w/w) and the pH adjusted \n\nto pH 8.0 with 2N NaOH. The dispersion was gently stirred for 2h at room temperature and \n\nthen centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 30 min at 4\u00baC in a Sorvall RC5 Plus centrifuge (GSA-\n\nrotor, Dupont, UK). The supernatant was adjusted to pH 4.5 with 2N HCl and centrifuged \n\nat 5,000 x g (Sorvall GSA-rotor) for 15 min at 4\u00baC. The precipitate was then suspended in \n\nwater and the pH adjusted to 8.0 with 2N NaOH, followed by freeze-drying of the \n\nsuspension (Petruccelli and A\u00f1\u00f3n, 1995). \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 117\n\n2.3. Preparation of biopolymer solutions and gels \n\nSoy protein isolate and xanthan stock solutions were prepared at ambient \n\ntemperature by magnetic stirring and the pH was adjusted to 7.0. These stock solutions \n\nwere mixed at different concentrations and temperatures (10 and 25 oC) as shown in Table \n\n2 before the addition of glucono-delta-lactone. The concentration of GDL used in each \n\nformulation depended on GDL/SPI ratio, which was defined experimentally (Results and \n\nDiscussion section) in order to obtain a steady state final pH (pHf) equal to 4.5 (SPI \n\nisoelectric point). The levels of GDL/SPI ratio used in the screening to obtain the adequate \n\nGDL concentration to achieve the isoelectric point at steady state varied from 0.13-0.3 and \n\nit was according to previous works in the literature (Dybowska and Fujio, 1998, Roesch et \n\nal., 2004, Tay et al., 2005). \n\nTable 2.

The small deformation \n\nrheological properties during gelation at 25 \u00baC were obtained by oscillatory shear \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 118\n\nmeasurements. In addition, the samples were kept at 25 \u00baC for 24 h or 10 oC for 3 days after \n\nGDL addition before performing the uniaxial compression measurements. \n\n2.4. Gel properties measurements \n\n2.4.1. pH \n\nThe pH of the gels was monitored during the entire gelation process. The decay in \n\npH caused by GDL hydrolysis was measured using a Sentron 2001 pH meter (Sentron Inc., \n\nUSA) equipped with an electrode calibrated at the reaction temperature over the pH range \n\nfrom 7.0 to 4.0. \n\n2.4.2. Rheological oscillatory measurements \n\nThe oscillatory shear measurements were done using a stress-controlled rheometer \n\n(Carri-Med CSL2500, TA Instruments, England). Time sweep measurements were done \n\nduring the gelation process at 25 \u00baC, 0.1 Hz and 0.1 Pa. A double wall concentric cylinder \n\nwas used for systems without polysaccharide. The external diameter of the rotating bob was \n\n21.96 mm, while the internal diameter was 20.38 mm. The stationary cylinder had an \n\ninternal diameter of 20 mm and an external diameter of 22.38 mm. Cone and plate \n\ngeometry (angle 2o, diameter 60 mm) was used for samples containing xanthan. The \n\nLissajous figures at various times were plotted to ensure that the measurements of G\u2019 \n\n(storage modulus) and G\u201d (loss modulus) were always obtained within the linear \n\nviscoelastic region. \n\n2.4.3. Compression measurements \n\nCompression measurements were done using a TA-XT2i texture analyser (Stable \n\nMicrosystems Ltd., England) equipped with an acrylic cylindrical plate (30 mm diameter). \n\nAll measurements were done in triplicate at 25 \u00baC when the gels attained the steady state \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 119\n\nproperties. The gels were compressed to 80% of their original height using a crosshead \n\nspeed of 1 mm/s.  \n\nThe force (F) and height (H) values were transformed into true stress (?) and \n\nHencky strain (?H), Equations 1 and 2 respectively, in order to account the increase in \n\nsurface area during compression (Steffe, 1996). The rupture properties (stress and strain at \n\nfracture) were obtained from the maximum point of the stress-strain curve, while the Young \n\nmodulus (Elinear) was the slope of the initial linear region of this curve.  \n\n( ) ( ) ??\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n=\n\n00 AH\ntH\n\ntF?

Statistical analysis \n\nValues reported for compression properties represent the mean of three replicates, \n\nand the error is reported as standard deviation. The results were evaluated by analysis of \n\nvariance (ANOVA) using the software Statistica (5.0 version, USA), with the sources of \n\nvariation being the SPI concentration and the gel type (xanthan addition and gelation \n\ntemperature). The differences between the means of several treatments were assessed using \n\nthe Tukey procedure with p<0.05. \n\n \n3. Results and discussions \n\n3.1. Determination of GDL/SPI ratio \n\nIn previous works, the range of GDL/SPI ratio used to induce the gelation of SPI, \n\ntofu or SPI fractions varied from 0.1 (Tay et al., 2005) up to 0.3 (Dybowska and Fujio, \n\n1998). Thus, a screening of GDL/SPI ratio was carried out to determine a suitable \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 121\n\nconcentration of GDL required to attain the SPI isoelectric point (pH 4.5) at steady state. \n\nFigure 1 shows the steady state pH achieved in SPI (2-8%) solutions after the addition of \n\ndifferent amount of GDL. During gelation with GDL, the final pH of the system was a \n\nfunction of the amount of lactone added (Lucey et al., 1998). GDL was rapidly hydrolysed \n\nto gluconic acid and resulted in a fast reduction of the pH during the first 200 min, after \n\nwhich the pH decreased steadily (results not shown). The optimum GDL/SPI ratio to reach \n\nthe isoelectric point at steady state depended on the SPI concentration, being 0.17% for 2 \n\nand 4% SPI solutions and 0.14% for samples containing 6 and 8% of SPI. It means that the \n\nsuitable GDL concentration for 2, 4, 6 and 8% SPI solutions would be, respectively, 0.34, \n\n0.68, 0.84 and 1.12% (w/w). The increment in the GDL concentration as a function of SPI \n\ncontent took into account the buffering capacity of the soy proteins and keeps the \n\nacidification rates comparable to one another (Roesch et al., 2004). \n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n3.75 4 4.25 4.5 4.75\npHf\n\nG\nD\n\nL \n/ S\n\nP\nI (\n\n%\n w\n\n/w\n)\n\n0.17\n\n0.14\n\n \n\nFigure 1.

Small-strain oscillatory rheological properties \n\nThe development of the gel network structure at 25\u00b0C for GDL acidified SPI and \n\nSPI-xanthan solutions is shown in Figure 2. The G\u2019-G\u201d crossover times (tg) of systems was \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 122\n\nthe criterion considered to determine the gel time. The gelation profile in Figure 2 was \n\nplotted against the reduced time, t/tg, shifting the data along the horizontal axis in order to \n\neliminate the effect of the kinetics of GDL hydrolysis. At the gel point, the values of G* \n\nwere very low (up to 1.5 Pa) and thereafter all curves showed a monotonic increase in G* \n\nwith time. The reduction in SPI concentration or the addition of xanthan resulted in a \n\nslower initial rate of G* growth, such that at a given reduced time (t/tg = 1.6) G* was ~30 \n\nPa, ~120 Pa and ~220 Pa for 8% SPI-xanthan, 4% SPI and 8% SPI gels, respectively.  \n\nThe gelation time for all concentrations studied of pure SPI systems was ~80 min \n\nand the pH at this point (pHg) was near 5.6 at 25\u00b0C (Figure 2). Similar pH was reported by \n\nRoesch et al. (2004) for acidified SPI/milk gels (pH ~5.8). However, these authors \n\nobserved a decrease of the gel time with the increase of the percentage of SPI content in \n\nskim milk-SPI mixtures. Braga et al. (2006b) showed that the gel time of GDL-induced Na-\n\ncaseinate systems was dependent on the protein concentration. Thus, the variation of gel \n\ntime found by Roesch et al. (2004) could be attributed to the presence of milk proteins. \n\n \nFigure 2. Complex modulus (G*) and pH evolution during the acidification of SPI solutions \nas a function of the reduced time (t/tg). Systems: 4% SPI- G* (?), pH (dashed line); 8% \nSPI- G* (?), pH (dotted line); 8% SPI + 0.2% xanthan- G* (?), pH (dot/dashed line). \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 123\n\nFigure 2 also shows that the addition of 0.2% xanthan in 8% SPI sample reduced the \n\nG\u2019-G\u201d crossover time to ~50 min, while the pHg was almost the same, 5.7. In the presence \n\nof milk proteins or xanthan the gel time and network strength of SPI systems changed, \n\nalthough the pHg was kept almost the same. SPI is highly unstable in the pH range from 5-\n\n6, since most of the fractions isoelectric points occur within this range of pH, 4.8-5.4 for A-\n\n11S, 4.9 for ?-7S, 5.2 for ?\u2019-7S and 5.7-6.0 for ?-7S (Hermansson, 1986). Thus, the \n\ndecrease of the gel time with the addition of xanthan could be explained by an increase of \n\nSPI instabilities caused by the screening of the excluded volume effect when another \n\nbiopolymer is also present. On the other hand, the decrease of the network strength at the \n\nbeginning of gelation could be related to SPI-xanthan specific interactions. Figure 2 shows \n\nthat from the pH 5.7 (gel point and isoelectric point of ?-7S) to 5.4 (isoelectric point of A-\n\n11S) the network strength is higher for 8%SPI gel than for 8%SPI-xanthan gel. Mohamad \n\nRamlan et al., (2004) observed that the ?-7S and ?-7S subunits contribute to the increase of \n\ngel hardness relative to the complete 7S protein. In addition, Braga et al. (2006a) reported \n\nthat xanthan preferentially interacts with the ?-7S fraction of SPI in acid heat-induced gels. \n\nThese indicate that the lower strength observed for SPI-xanthan gel could be attributed to a \n\nlinkage between the ?-7S with xanthan such that this fraction was not corroborating to the \n\nnetwork strength. \n\n3.3. Compression rheological properties \n\nThe difference between the model described in Equation 3 and BST equation is the \n\naddition of an initial stress parameter (?0) and a change on the first power exponent from n \n\nto \u2013n. The insert of the initial stress parameter was necessary because the data aquired did \n\nnot started from zero, as previously observed for agarose gels (Barrangou et al., 2006). The \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 124\n\nchange in the exponent signal modified the behaviour of the stress-stretch curve enabling \n\nthe prediction of two more parameters as compared to BST equation, namely, 1) stress at \n\nfracture and 2) strain at fracture. These two parameters could be obtained by making the \n\nfirst derivative of stress in relation to stretch equal to zero. In addition, the present equation \n\nalso predicts the two parameters previously obtained from BST equation, namely, 1) Young \n\nmodulus, E and 2) elasticity parameter in the non-linear region, n. The schematic \n\nrepresentation of Equation 3 is shown in Figure 3 in order to discuss the meaning of the \n\nparameter E and the exponent n. \n\n \nFigure 3. Schematic representation of Equation 3 for different values of n, n>0. The dashed \nline represents the ideal elastic behaviour obtained for very low n values (n~0). The solid \nlines represent the behaviour for higher n values (n>0, n>>0). \n\nThe BST equation was originally proposed to provide a good fit to data for \n\nelastomers obtained in various deformation fields up to the point of rupture (Blatz et al., \n\n1974). The estimated parameter E (or 3G in shear) is usually interpreted as the elasticity \n\nmodulus in the linear region and it is obtained from the initial slope of the stress/strain \n\ncurve. The same meaning can be used for the model proposed here. As mentioned above, \n\nthe negative signal in the first exponent of Equation 3 resulted in the observation of a \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 125\n\nmaximum in the stress-stretch curve, which can be physically related to the fracture point \n\nof the gel under uniaxial compression. Figure 3 shows an inverse correlation between \n\npositive n values and the fracture stress and strain values. The value of n is also associated \n\nwith the variation of the slope of the curve before the fracture point. This rate of slope \n\nchange (n) can be regarded as a measure of deviation from ideal Hookean behaviour. When \n\nthe material is deformed a strain-weakening phenomenon can arise resulting in an increase \n\nof the stress with the deformation slower than in the ideal case. Figure 3 shows that the \n\nstrain-weakening effect become more pronounced as n values increase from n?0 to n>>0. \n\nThis means that a more fragile gel will also present a shorter linear interval and a high n \n\nvalue  \n\nAn example of data modelling for SPI systems at 25\u00b0C is shown in Figure 4 and \n\nEquation 3 provided a good fit to the raw data. Equation 3 could describe well the data \n\nfrom the beginning up to just after the maximum of the stress-stretch curve, beyond that the \n\nmodel deviates from the experimental data. The gel with lowest SPI concentration had the \n\npoorest fit, which was a result of the difficulties associated with the experimental \n\ncompression of a very fragile gel resulting in a high dispersion of the data. The model also \n\nshowed a good fit to experimental data of SPI-xanthan gels made at 10 oC, with exception \n\nfor the sample containing 4% SPI. However, the latter system and those of SPI-xanthan \n\nmade at 25 oC could be fitted up to the fracture point, as the previous models described in \n\nthe literature (Blatz et al., 1974, Barrangou et al., 2006). \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 126\n\n \nFigure 4. Stress-stretch profile of GDL-SPI gels at 25 oC. Systems: 4% SPI (?), 6% SPI \n(?), 8% SPI (?). The lines represent fits according to the model of Equation 3. \n\nFigure 5 shows the effect of SPI concentration on the non-linear elastic parameter n. \n\nA gradual decrease of n with the increase of protein content was observed for the GDL-SPI \n\ngels. In contrast, an increase of this parameter was found for systems containing xanthan, \n\nindependent of the gelation temperature. On gelation at lower temperature, the curve of the \n\ndependence of n on SPI concentration shifts to a lower n level. The original work of Blatz \n\net al. (1974) suggested that the parameter n is a material constant and is therefore \n\nindependent of concentration. However, it was found here that n changed with the protein \n\nconcentration for SPI and SPI-xanthan gels that. Bot et al. (1996) and Barrangou et al. \n\n(2006) also reported a dependence of n on gel concentration when studying, respectively, \n\ngelatin and agarose gels. \n\nThe specific effects of xanthan addition and acidification temperature on the \n\ndependence of SPI concentration (C) on n were evaluated. The knowledge of the way that a \n\nlarge-deformation parameter depends on protein concentration is of particular importance \n\nfor new products development. The dependence of n on SPI concentration was estimated by \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 127\n\nfitting a first order exponential equation to data using non-linear least squares regression. \n\nThe following exponential equations were obtained for the SPI gels (Equation 7), SPI-\n\nxanthan gels at 25\u00b0C (Equation 8) and SPI-xanthan gels at 10\u00b0C (Equation 9): \n\nCen 16.04.882.16 ??+?=  (7) \n\nCen 31.0454.14 ???=  (8) \n\nCen 76.07.1284.6 ??+=  (9) \n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nSPI concentration (%)\n\nn\n (\n\n-)\n\n \nFigure 5. Variation of n as a function of SPI concentration for GDL-induced gels: SPI at 25 \noC (?), SPI + 0.2% xanthan at 25 oC (?), SPI + 0.2% xanthan at 10 oC (?). The solid \nlines represent the exponential fit to n values. \n\nThe velocity of variation of n with the SPI concentration was greater for gels with \n\nxanthan as compared with those without the polysaccharide. As mentioned before, the \n\nformer gels showed exponential growth n dependence, while the latter systems showed \n\nexponential decrease. This approach revealed that the mechanism for strain-weakening is \n\nnot the same for SPI and SPI-xanthan gels. The former group of gels will probably show \n\nstrain-hardening at very high protein content. However, the protein-polysaccharide \n\ninteractions in SPI-xanthan gels could not lead to the observation of strain-hardening \n\nphenomenon. Regarding the gelation temperature, the faster n variation was found for the \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 128\n\nlowest gelation temperature. This indicates that for the latter systems the n value attained \n\nfaster the steady state, such that beyond ~12% SPI the gels would show similar large-\n\ndeformation behaviour. The change of the gelation temperature did not affect very much \n\nthe strain-weakening mechanism found out for gels containing xanthan. \n\nIn order to check if the model from Equation 3 gives reliable parameters, the Young \n\nmodulus obtained from Equation 3 (Emodel) was compared to those obtained from the linear \n\nregression (Elinear) of the initial part of the stress-strain curve (Figure 6). There was no \n\nsignificant difference at p<0.05 between Emodel and Elinear except for the gels containing 4% \n\nSPI (Figure 6A) and 4% SPI-xanthan 0.2% acidified at 10 oC. Previous works on gelatine \n\nand agarose gels (Barrangou et al., 2006) showed, respectively, a higher and lower value of \n\nthe estimated modulus as compared to the modulus obtained from the linear fit.  \n\n \nFigure 6. Variation of Young modulus (E) as a function of SPI concentration for GDL-\ninduced gels: SPI at 25 \u00b0C (a), SPI + 0.2% xanthan at 25 \u00b0C (b), SPI + 0.2% xanthan at 10 \n\u00b0C (c). Different letters indicate significant differences at p<0.05 (small letters: variation of \nEmodel with SPI concentration for each type of GDL-gel; capital letters: comparisson \nbetween Emodel and Elinear for each concentration and GDL-gel type). \n\nThe model also showed a good prediction for stress at fracture as compared with the \n\nvalues from the true stress-Hencky strain curve (Figure 7). All samples were not \n\nstatistically significantly different p<0.05, except the gel with 4% SPI and xanthan at 10\u00b0C. \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 129\n\nAs the value of Emodel was in good agreement with Elinear, the poor prediction of stress at \n\nfracture was attributed to the n value (Equation 5). \n\n \n\nFigure 7. Variation of stress at fracture as a function of SPI concentration for GDL-induced \ngels: SPI at 25\u00b0C (a), SPI + 0.2% xanthan at 25\u00b0C (b), SPI + 0.2% xanthan at 10\u00b0C (c). \nDifferent letters and numbers indicate significant differences at p<0.05 (letters: variation of \nthe property with SPI concentration for each type of GDL-gel; numbers: variation of the \nproperty with type of GDL-gel for each SPI concentration). * Value divided by 6. \n\n \n\nThe prediction of the strain at fracture values (Figure 8) was very good for systems \n\nthat the data was fitted beyond the fracture point. However, a poor correlation between the \n\nmodel prediction and experimental strain at fracture was observed when the data was fitted \n\nup to the fracture point (4% SPI of Figure 8c). It is interesting to note that the tendency \n\nshown by the strain at fracture predicted from the model for gels with xanthan was the same \n\nfor both gelation temperatures (Figures 8b and 8c). However, it was not observed a clear \n\nfracture point for SPI-xanthan gels acidified at 25 oC, such that only the predicted values \n\nwere shown in Figure 8b. Those gels showed a sponge-like visual appearance and at large \n\ndeformation and it was observed a stress flat part followed by a continuous non-linear \n\nincrease of the stress. All the above comparisons showed that the present model could be \n\nused as a good predictor for all compression parameters. \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 130\n\nFigure 3 and Equations 5 and 6 show that the non-linear elastic parameter affects \n\nnot only the curve appearance, but also the stress and strain at fracture values. This \n\ncorrelation between n and fracture parameters is very interesting, since it enables the \n\nmanipulation of the breaking stress and strain of the gel: for example by enhancing the \n\nelasticity parameter n it would be possible to decrease the breaking stress or strain of a gel \n\nin a very elegant way. This could be obtained by decreasing the SPI concentration in pure \n\ngels or by increasing the protein concentration in gels made with xanthan. Another option \n\nfor the latter gels would be the increase of gelation temperature. \n\n \nFigure 8. Variation of Hencky strain at fracture as a function of SPI concentration for GDL-\ninduced gels: SPI at 25\u00b0C (a), SPI + 0.2% xanthan at 25\u00b0C (b), SPI + 0.2% xanthan at 10\u00b0C \n(c). Different letters and numbers indicate significant differences at p<0.05 (letters: \nvariation of the property with SPI concentration for each type of GDL-gel; numbers: \nvariation of the property with type of GDL-gel for each SPI concentration). * Value divided \nby 15. \n\n3.4. Interactions between SPI and xanthan \n\nThe effects of SPI concentration, xanthan addition and gelation temperature on gel \n\nproperties are shown in Figure 6 for Young modulus, Figure 7 for stress at fracture and \n\nFigure 8 for strain at fracture. The addition of 0.2% xanthan reduced the visual syneresis of \n\nSPI gels and increased significantly the stress at fracture (p<0.05), which was more \n\npronounced for systems containing low amount of SPI (Figure 7). However, SPI and SPI-\n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 131\n\nxanthan gels with 8% of protein showed statistically similar properties. Carrageenan at \n\nrelatively low concentration (0.2%) has shown to enhance the water holding capacity of a \n\n10% soybean protein gel without affecting its hardness (Abd Karim et al., 1999). These two \n\nanionic polysaccharides seem to have similar effects on the gel hardness of high protein \n\ncontent gels. The addition of xanthan resulted in more deformable gels as compared to pure \n\nSPI samples (Figure 8), but the Young modulus was only affected (decreased) for the 6% \n\nSPI gel (Figure 6). The lower acidification temperature increased significantly the stress at \n\nfracture of SPI-xanthan gels (Figures 7b and 7c), but did not affected the Young modulus \n\n(p<0.05). As 6 and 8% SPI-xanthan gels at 25\u00b0C showed a sponge-like visual appearance \n\nthe strain at fracture behaviour could not be compared to those of the gels prepared at 10\u00b0C.  \n\nThe increase of the protein content in SPI pure gels resulted in harder, firmer and \n\nmore deformable gels.  SPI-xanthan gels showed a trend of decreasing the stress and strain \n\nat fracture with the increase of SPI concentration (Figures 7 and 8), but the Young modulus \n\nincreased with the protein content. Thus, xanthan seems to interact with soy proteins in \n\ndifferent ways, depending on the amount of protein present in the gel. As mentioned before, \n\nthe gels with more than 6% protein showed a sponge-like appearance. The presence of \n\nholes could explain the lower stress at fracture found as compared to 4% SPI-xanthan gels. \n\nIn general, xanthan seems to assist the protein aggregation and network formation. At high \n\nprotein concentration and acidification temperature, the aggregation happened faster \n\n(Figure 2) and in a random way, such that the sponge-like appearance was formed. In \n\naddition, the strands formed in that process were more elastic than those for the systems \n\nwith lower protein content.  \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 132\n\n4. Conclusions \n\nThe model proposed enabled the prediction of two more parameters, the stress and \n\nstrain at fracture, as compared to the BST equation. In addition, the Young modulus and \n\nnon-elastic parameter (n) could also be predicted as was previous possible with BST \n\nequation. It was observed a good fit of the model equation to the raw data from the linear \n\nregion up to and beyond the fracture point. The estimated Young modulus, stress and strain \n\nat fracture showed a good correlation with the linear Young modulus, true stress and \n\nHencky strain at fracture, validating the model. An exponential fit was used to determine \n\nthe dependence of n on SPI concentrations, which may be useful in predicting the \n\nrheological properties of tofu model systems (SPI and SPI-xanthan gels). This has future \n\ncommercial advantages as the mechanical properties are related to sensory texture and \n\nconsequently product acceptability. The addition of xanthan reduced the gel time, but \n\nresulted in a less elastic network in the beginning of the gelation process. However, at \n\nsteady state, xanthan reduced the visual syneresis of SPI gels and increased both the stress \n\nand strain at fracture, although the Young modulus was statistically similar to SPI gels. The \n\nlower gelation temperature increased significantly the stress at fracture of SPI-xanthan gels. \n\n \n\n5.

Changes in protein solubility and subunit \n\ncomposition as well as in the mechanical properties, microstructure and water holding \n\ncapacity of the gels were determined. The effect of KCl addition on each biopolymer \n\nsolution was also investigated. The results indicated that SPI-xanthan gels prepared without \n\nKCl were mainly stabilized by non-covalent (H-bonding and hydrophobic) and SS bond \n\ninteractions, whereas in gels containing KCl, electrostatic interactions were also involved in \n\nmaintaining the gel structure. The ?-7S subunit was probably the fraction electrostatically \n\nlinked to the xanthan. The different values found for the mechanical properties after the \n\naddition of xanthan and/or KCl, were associated with the coarseness of the gel. Xanthan \n\nand KCl probably showed a synergistic effect on the Young modulus because KCl induced \n\na conformation transition of the xanthan molecules. \n\nKeywords: heat-induced gel, interactions, salt, soy protein isolate, xanthan. \n\n \n\n1. Introduction \n\nSoy proteins are the most important representative of legume proteins due to their \n\nhigh protein level and well-balanced amino-acid composition, showing great potential in \n\nthe substitution of meat and dairy proteins (Van Vliet, Martin &amp; Bos, 2002). They are \n\napplied in a wide range of food products especially because of their ability to form gels \n\nwith good water holding capacity on heating. The functional properties of soy protein \n\nisolates reflect the composition and structure of their globulins, which correspond to 50 \u2013 \n\n90% of the total proteins (Utsumi, Damodaran &amp; Kinsella, 1984). The soy protein fractions \n\ncan be classified by their sedimentation constants, showing approximate Svedberg \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 3rd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 138\n\ncoefficients of 2S, 7S, 11S and 15S. The two major globulins in soybeans are ?-conglycinin \n\nand glycinin, also called 7S and 11S, respectively. The glycinin subunits consist of two \n\npolypeptide components linked via disulfide bonds (AB), one with acidic (A) and the other \n\nwith basic (B) isoelectric points (Staswick, Hermodson &amp; Nielsen, 1984). At ambient \n\ntemperature and pH 7.6, glycinin forms hexameric complexes (11S) with two rings each \n\ncontaining three hydrophobically associated subunits. At pH 3.8 this protein is mainly \n\npresent in the form of trimeric complexes (7S-form), while at pH 3.0 glycinin may be \n\ndissociated into the 3S form (1AB) (Wolf, Rackis, Smith, Sasame &amp; Babcock, 1958). ?-\n\nconglycinin is a trimeric glycoprotein consisting of at least six combinations of three \n\nsubunits: ?, ?\u2019 and ? (Thanh &amp; Shibasaki, 1977). \n\nThe formation of protein networks is considered to be a result of the balance \n\nbetween protein-protein and protein-water interactions and of the attraction and repulsion \n\nforces occurring between adjacent polypeptide chains (Cheftel, Cuq &amp; Lorient, 1996). The \n\nmolecular forces involved in the formation of heat-induced soy protein gels are probably \n\nhydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, whereas in gel maintenance the forces \n\ninvolved are disulfide and hydrogen bonds (Utsumi &amp; Kinsella, 1985). The gel formation \n\nprocess and network structure could be affected by the addition of salts (increasing ionic \n\nstrength) and changes in pH (Lakemond, de Jongh, Hessing, Gruppen &amp; Voragen, 2000). \n\nGenerally the pH of food products ranges from pH 3 to 7 and the ionic strength varies from \n\n0.02 to 0.2 M. \n\nSodium chloride (NaCl) is widely employed in food products, but the ingestion of \n\ngreat amounts of this salt can increase the risk of hypertension (Abernethy, 1979) and \n\nurinary calcium loss (Bell, Eldrid &amp; Watson, 1992). To avoid this, the NaCl could be \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 3rd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 139\n\npartially substituted by KCl, although this change could have an effect on protein stability \n\nand, consequently, on the product texture and water holding capacity. The effect of partial \n\nor complete replacement of NaCl with KCl on protein and gel properties has been \n\ninvestigated for dairy systems (Katsiari, Voutsinas, Alichanidis &amp; Roussis, 1997) and for \n\ndifferent proteins from seed flour (Ogungbenle, Oshodi &amp; Oladimeji, 2002; Arogundade, \n\nAkinfenwa &amp; Salawu, 2004). \n\nProtein functionality can also be modified by interactions with other ingredients \n\nsuch as polysaccharides, present in many food systems (Tolstogusov, 1993). Xanthan is a \n\nhigh molecular weight anionic polysaccharide commonly used as a stabilizer and thickener \n\nin food products. This polymer consists of a linear (1-4)-?-D glucose backbone with a \n\ncharged trisaccharide side chain on each second glucose residue (Jansson, Kenne &amp; \n\nLindberg, 1975). Hua, Cui and Wang (2003) observed in a soy protein\u2013xanthan mixed gel, \n\nthat the protein component was the supporting phase even at a xanthan concentration as \n\nhigh as 1%. Carp, Bartholomai and Pilosof (1999) studied the foaming and solubility \n\nproperties of soy proteins as affected by xanthan gum. However, to our knowledge, there \n\nare no publications on the effect of KCl addition on the properties of soy protein-xanthan \n\nsystems. \n\nThe purpose of this work was to investigate soy protein/xanthan interactions as a \n\nfunction of KCl concentration in heat-induced gels, by evaluating water holding capacity \n\nand uniaxial compression measurements. The synergistic/antagonistic effect between \n\nproteins and polysaccharides was also studied from the structural characteristics of gels, as \n\nassessed by confocal laser microscopy and the electrophoretic pattern of the soluble \n\nproteins. Furthermore, the soy protein-KCl and xanthan-KCl binary systems were studied \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 3rd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 140\n\naccording to their thermal and rheological properties, respectively, in order to clarify the \n\nmolecular conformation of the biopolymers that participated in the network formation. \n\n2. Material and methods \n\n2.1. Material \n\nSoy protein isolate (SPI) was obtained from defatted soy flour (Bunge Alimentos \n\nS.A., Brazil). Xanthan gum was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (USA) and KCl from \n\nMerck KGaA. (Germany). \n\n2.2. Preparation of soy protein isolate \n\nDefatted soy flour was dispersed in distilled water (1:10 w/w) and the pH adjusted \n\nto pH 8.0 with 2N NaOH. The dispersion was gently stirred for 2h at room temperature and \n\nthen centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 30 min at 4\u00baC in a Sorvall RC5 Plus centrifuge (GSA-\n\nrotor, Dupont, UK). The supernatant was adjusted to pH 4.5 with 2N HCl and centrifuged \n\nat 5,000 x g (Sorvall GSA-rotor) for 15 min at 4\u00baC. The precipitate was then suspended in \n\nwater and the pH adjusted to 8.0 with 2N NaOH, followed by freeze-drying of the \n\nsuspension (Petruccelli &amp; A\u00f1\u00f3n, 1995a). The protein (N x 6.25), moisture and ash contents \n\nof the SPI powder were, respectively, 89.3 \u00b1 0.3%, 6.7 \u00b1 1.6% and 3.29 \u00b1 0.02% (wet \n\nbasis). \n\n2.3. Preparation of biopolymer solutions and gels \n\nA soy protein isolate solution was prepared at ambient temperature by magnetic \n\nstirring with or without KCl. The xanthan powder was dispersed in water (3% w/w) at pH \n\n3.0 with mechanical stirring for 1 h at 80\u00baC. This solution was subsequently cooled to 10\u00baC \n\nand diluted according to the concentrations of the two factorial designs (Table 1). The \n\nrheological properties of a 0.3% xanthan solution were also compared with those of a \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 3rd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 141\n\nsolution with the same xanthan concentration, but prepared by a 10-fold dilution of a 3% \n\nsolution. \n\nTable 1.

The mixed solutions were \n\nplaced into glass tubes (30 mm diameter and 30 mm height) and closed tightly with \n\nstoppers. Gelation was carried out by heating the glass tubes in a water bath at 90\u00baC for 30 \n\nmin (Damodaran, 1988), followed by immediate cooling in an ice bath. The samples were \n\nkept at 10\u00baC for 20 h before analyzing the gel properties. \n\n2.4. Factorial designs \n\nThe different model systems were chosen according to two factorial designs with 22 \n\ntrials (SPI-KCl and SPI-xanthan gels) and another factorial design with 23 trials (SPI-\n\nxanthan-KCl gels). Table 1 shows the ranges of the SPI, xanthan and KCl concentrations \n\nused in the factorial designs. \n\n2.5. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) \n\nDSC studies were performed in a DSC 2920 Modulated DSC differential scanning \n\ncalorimeter (TA Instruments, USA). Indium and water were used to calibrate the \n\ntemperature scale and enthalpic response of the equipment. The measurements were done \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 3rd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 142\n\nwith four different samples containing 20% (w/w) protein dispersed in water or in salt \n\nsolution at pH 3.0 and 7.0. The amount of KCl used (0.54 M) was calculated based on the \n\nKCl/SPI ratio of 0.27, which was obtained considering the 22 experimental design (SPI-\n\nKCl) sample with maximum salt and minimum protein contents. A DSC hermetic pan \n\ncontaining about 10-15 mg of sample was tightly sealed and placed in the DSC cell. An \n\nempty capsule was used as the reference. The samples were analyzed at 10 \u00baC/min from 10 \n\nto 110\u00baC in triplicate. The temperature at which denaturation started, known as the onset \n\ndenaturation temperature Tonset, was calculated by taking the intercept of the baseline and \n\nthe extrapolated maximum slope of the peak. The peak denaturation temperature Tpeak was \n\nconsidered to be the temperature at maximum heat flow. The enthalpy of thermal \n\ndenaturation was calculated from the area of the endothermic peak. \n\n2.6. Intrinsic Viscosity \n\nThe viscosities of the xanthan solutions were measured using a size 100 Cannon-\n\nFenske semi-micro capillary viscometer (Cannon Instrument Co., USA). The viscometer \n\nwas immersed in a water bath maintained at 10.0 \u00b1 0.5\u00baC. Solvent runs (water and 0.4 M \n\nKCl solution) were performed frequently to calibrate the instrument. The relative viscosity \n\nof a given solution ?rel (defined as the ratio between the solution and solvent viscosities) \n\nwas determined by measuring the relative efflux times in the capillary. Viscosity values \n\nwere based on at least 3-4 efflux time readings taken for various concentrations of xanthan \n\nsolution. All measurements were made in the concentration range from about 0.05 to \n\n0.004% (w/v). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 3rd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 143\n\n2.7. Rheological oscillatory measurements \n\nA stress-controlled rheometer (Carri-Med CSL2500, TA Instruments, England) with \n\nan acrylic cone and plate geometry (diameter 60 mm) was used to make the oscillatory \n\nrheological measurements. Stock solutions were prepared at 0.3% (w/w) or at 3% (w/w) \n\nand diluted to 0.3% (w/w). Xanthan solutions (0.3% w/w) with or without KCl were poured \n\ndirectly onto the plate of the instrument at 10\u00baC. Frequency sweeps were done from 0.01 to \n\n10 Hz at 0.35 Pa and 10\u00baC. The Lissajous figures at each frequency were plotted to ensure \n\nthat the measurements of G\u2019 (storage modulus) and G\u201d (loss modulus) were always \n\nobtained within the linear viscoelastic region. \n\n2.8. Mechanical properties of the gels \n\nUniaxial compression experiments in triplicate were done using a TA-XT2i texture \n\nanalyzer (Stable Microsystems Ltd., England) with an acrylic cylindrical plate (35 mm \n\ndiameter). Gels were compressed to 80% of their original height using a crosshead speed of \n\n1 mm/s. All measurements were done at 10\u00baC after 20 h of gel formation. The force and \n\nheight values obtained were transformed into true stress (?H) \u2013 true strain (?H) curves \n\n(Steffe, 1996). The rupture properties were associated with the maximum point of the \n\nstress-strain curve and the Young modulus (E) was the slope of the first linear interval of \n\nthe stress-strain curve. \n\n2.9. Water holding capacity (WHC) of the gels \n\nA cylindrical gel (~1.0 g) was placed on a disc of Whatman # 1 filter paper \n\n(Whatman, U.K.) and positioned in the middle of a 50 mL centrifuge tube. The water loss \n\nwas determined by weighing the gel before and after centrifugation at 4,000 g for 10 min at \n\n15\u00baC (Kocher &amp; Foegeding, 1993) in a Sorvall RC5 Plus centrifuge using a SS-34 rotor \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 3rd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 144\n\n(Dupont, UK). The WHC values were expressed as the percent of the ratio of the amount of \n\nwater remaining to the initial amount of water present in the gel. \n\n2.10. Protein solubility of the gels \n\nSamples were dispersed either in distilled water at pH 8.0 (DW), in a pH 8.0 buffer \n\n(0.086 M Tris, 0.09 M glycine and 4 mM Na2EDTA) (B), or in the same buffer containing \n\nother reagents, namely 1) 6 M urea (BU), 2) 1% ?-mercaptoethanol (BM) and 3) 6 M urea \n\nplus 1% ?-mercaptoethanol (BUM) (Shimada &amp; Cheftel, 1988). Tris buffer disrupts the \n\nelectrostatic interactions, urea acts by disrupting the H-bonding and hydrophobic \n\ninteractions, while the SS bond is reduced when the solvent contains ?-mercaptoethanol \n\n(Cheftel et al., 1996). Samples (8.5 mg protein/mL) were homogenized at room temperature \n\nwith an Ultra Turrax model T18 basic homogenizer (IKA, Germany) for 2 min and then \n\ncentrifuged at 20,000 x g for 15 min at 25\u00b0C in an AllegraTM 64R Beckman centrifuge with \n\na F0850 rotor (Beckman, USA). The protein solubility was determined from the \n\nsupernatants and expressed as 100 x protein content in the supernatant / total protein \n\ncontent. Three independent extractions were done with each solvent. The protein \n\nconcentrations were determined at 280 nm in a Beckman Du-70 spectrophotometer \n\n(Beckman, USA) using an apparent extinction coefficient ( mLmgcmE\n/1\n\n1 ) of 1.141 for proteins \n\ndispersed in water and of 1.193 for the pH 8.0 buffer. The extinction coefficients were \n\nobtained by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm of a 1 mg/mL soy protein solution, the \n\nconcentration being determined by the Kjeldhal method. \n\n2.11. Electrophoresis \n\nSDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was carried out following the \n\nmethod of Laemmli (1970). The samples containing soluble proteins from the gel, extracted \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 3rd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 145\n\nin different media, were diluted with an equal volume of a pH 6.8 buffer (62.5 mM Tris-\n\nHCl, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.05% bromophenol blue) containing (reducing condition) or \n\nnot containing (non-reducing condition) 5% ?-mercaptoethanol. Commercial molecular \n\nweight markers covering the 6,000 to 181,500 Da molecular weight range were used \n\n(Sigma-Aldrich Co., USA). The gels were run at 120 V through the stacking (4% \n\npolyacrilamide) and separating (12% polyacrilamide) gels, in a Mini Cell Protean \n\nelectrophoresis unit (Biorad Laboratories, USA). The gels were stained with 0.25% (v/v) \n\nCoomassie Brilliant Blue, in ethanol:acetic acid:water (45:10:45, v/v), followed by \n\ndestaining with acetic acid:ethanol:water (5:10:85, v/v). The densitometric analyses of the \n\nbands were done using the Eagle Eye II system and the software Stratagene Eagle Sight \n\n(Stratagene, USA). \n\n2.12. Confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) \n\nProtein dispersions were prepared using the fluorescent dye Rhodamine B (50 \u00b5L of \n\na 0.4% rhodamine solution/100 mL protein solution), which stains the protein. Mixed gels \n\nwith intermediate concentrations of each ingredient (12% SPI + 0.153% xanthan or 12% \n\nSPI + 0.153% xanthan + 0.14 M KCl) were observed. Samples of the mixed solution were \n\nplaced on microscope slides, covered with a glass cover slip and sealed with nail polish to \n\nprevent evaporation. In order to obtain the mixed gels, the slides were transferred to a \n\nplastic box, covered with a thin layer of soy oil to enhance heat transfer and heated in a \n\nwater bath at 90\u00baC for 30min. A dual-channel laser confocal system (MRC 1024 UV, \n\nBiorad, USA) mounted on an Axiovert 100 Zeiss inverted microscope and equipped with \n\nAr-Kr lasers was used to observe the gels. A wavelength of 568 nm was used to excite the \n\nrhodamine-labeled proteins. The settings for contrast, brightness and iris diameter were \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 3rd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 146\n\nadjusted and kept constant throughout the observations. Images were taken using a water \n\nimmersion objective at 40x. \n\n \n\n3. Results and discussion \n\n3.1. Rheology of the xanthan-KCl solutions \n\nInformation on molecule characteristics, such as conformation, hydration and \n\nflexibility, can be obtained from the measurement of the intrinsic viscosity of a polymer \n\n(Harding, 1997). Figure 1 shows the concentration dependence of the reduced viscosity of \n\nxanthan at 10\u00baC in water and in a 0.4 M KCl solution (both at pH 3.0). The Huggins \n\nequation (Equation 1), which expresses the reduced viscosity (?SP/C) of a polymer as a \n\nfunction of concentration (C), was found to be suitable for both xanthan solutions in the \n\ndilute region. \n\n[ ] [ ] CkC HSP 2??? +=  (1) \n\nwhere [?] is the intrinsic viscosity, C is the xanthan concentration, ?SP/C is the reduced \n\nviscosity and kH is the Huggins parameter. \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Reduced viscosity of xanthan solutions at 10\u00baC. Solvents: (?) deionized water, \n\n(?) 0.4 M KCl solution. \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 3rd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 147\n\nThe intrinsic viscosities, [?sp/C]c?0, of xanthan dispersed in water and in a salt \n\nsolution at pH 3.0, were 22 and 13.5 dL/g, respectively. The addition of salt decreased the \n\nintrinsic viscosity by approximately 35%, which indicates a reduction in the hydrodynamic \n\nsize of the molecule (Rochefort &amp; Middleman, 1987) since the charge screening reduces \n\nthe influence of coulombic interactions on the polymer conformation. The value for \n\nintrinsic viscosity obtained in water was lower than that reported by Yevlampieva, Pavlov \n\nand Rjumtsev (1999), 41 dL/g, and Wang, Sun and Wang (2001), 44.9 dL/g at 25\u00baC. These \n\ndifferences can be attributed to the lower pH (3.0) and temperature (10\u00baC) of the present \n\nsystem, as well as to different xanthan sources. \n\nThe Huggins parameter kH gives information about the solvent quality and a low \n\nHuggins constant (kH=0.478) was observed for the xanthan dispersion in water at pH 3.0 \n\nand a value of 1.2 for the salt solution. Values between 0.3-0.7 have been suggested for \n\nperfect solutions, whereas values of kH?1 would encourage aggregate formation (Millard, \n\nDintzis, Willett &amp; Klavons, 1997). This indicates that water at pH 3.0 is a good solvent, \n\nwhile the salt solution promoted self-association of the macromolecule. \n\nThe rheological behavior of xanthan solutions can give information on the \n\nmolecular conformation/aggregation of the polysaccharide. Figure 2 shows the frequency \n\ndependence of the elastic (G\u2019) and viscous (G\u201d) moduli of two xanthan solutions (0.3% \n\nw/w) prepared in different ways, to gain information about the effect of dilution on the \n\nmolecular aggregates. A 3% solution was prepared at 80\u00baC and subsequently diluted to \n\n0.3% (referred to as X-1). The other solution analyzed was prepared directly at 0.3% and \n\n80\u00baC (referred to as X-2). The X-2 solution exhibited a typical dilute solution behavior with \n\nthe crossover of the two moduli at the highest frequency tested. The X-1 solution showed a \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 3rd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 148\n\nvery different pattern although both solutions had the same concentration. The G\u2019-G\u201d \n\ncrossover was shifted to a lower frequency (~0.02 Hz) and the elastic modulus was larger \n\nthan that of the X-2 solution for the whole frequency range. This difference could be \n\nexplained by the formation of hydrogels during the preparation of the 3% xanthan sample at \n\n80 oC (Iseki et al., 2001). It could be suggested that the dilution of the 3% xanthan hydrogel \n\nresulted in a solution with insoluble aggregates. The X-1 solution was used to prepare the \n\nmixed gels. \n\n1.E-04\n\n1.E-03\n\n1.E-02\n\n1.E-01\n\n1.E+00\n\n1.E+01\n\n0.01 0.10 1.00 10.00\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nG\n',G\n\n'' \n(P\n\na)\n\n \n\nFigure 2.

The addition of salt resulted in a more structured solution with \n\nG\u2019>G\u201d throughout the entire frequency range analysed and with higher moduli values as \n\ncompared to the water system. This positive effect of KCl on the xanthan solution \n\nproperties was previously observed with NaCl (Rochefort &amp; Middleman, 1987). Such \n\nbehavior with salt solutions was explained by the salt-induced disorder-order transition and \n\nthe tendency to strengthen the intermolecular associations between the xanthan molecules. \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 3rd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 149\n\nThe addition of salt promotes screening of the electrostatic repulsion of the trisaccharide \n\nsidechains, allowing for the adoption of a helical backbone conformation (Rochefort &amp; \n\nMiddleman, 1987). Increases in the KCl concentration from 0.05 (data not shown) to 0.4 M \n\ndid not influence the rheological behavior of the solution, showing that above 0.05 M KCl, \n\nthe conformation and interactions of the xanthan molecule should be the same. \n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0.01 0.10 1.00 10.00\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nG\n',G\n\n'' \n(P\n\na)\n\n \n\nFigure 3.

Thermal behavior \n\nDSC experiments were performed to determine the characteristics of SPI \n\ndispersions prior to mixture with xanthan and subsequent heat-induced gelation. Figure 4 \n\nshows typical examples of DSC thermograms of soy protein isolate, the denaturation \n\nenthalpy and temperature for each sample treatment being obtained (Table 2). The DSC \n\nresults revealed varying effects of pH and salt addition on the stability of soy protein \n\nisolate. SPI dispersions at pH 7.0 showed two endothermic transitions for both samples, \n\nwhich can be attributed to thermal denaturation of the 7S protein at the lower temperature \n\nand of the 11S proteins at the higher temperature (Hermansson, 1986). The high \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 3rd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 150\n\ntemperature for the denaturation of glycinin (11S) could be attributed to the high stability of \n\nits structure and conformation due to hydrogen or disulfide bonds (Kim, Kim, Yang &amp; \n\nKwon, 2004). The addition of KCl increased the denaturation temperatures (Tonset and Tpeak) \n\ndue to the stabilizing effects of salts. Table 2 shows an increase in denaturation temperature \n\nof about 8 \u00baC for ?-conglycinin (7S) and 13 \u00baC for glycinin (11S). This effect could be \n\nattributed to two possible factors working either separately or concomitantly: (i) \n\nneutralization of charged side chains of the amino acid residues thus reducing inter and/or \n\nintra chain repulsion, and (ii) salt stabilized water structure (Damodaran, 1988). Table 2 \n\nshows similar total enthalpies for SPI dispersions at pH 7.0 and the value of ?HT found for \n\nSPI dispersion without salt addition agreed with that observed by Puppo et al. (2004). \n\n \n\nFigure 4. DSC thermograms of 20% (w/w) soy protein isolate dispersions with 0 M and \n\n0.54 M KCl at pH 7.0 and 3.0.

At pH 3.0 the endothermic transition related \n\nto 11S denaturation was not observed, due to the acidic denaturation of glycinin, which \n\nstarts at pH 3.75 and reaches a maximum at pH 2 (Koshiyama, 1972). At this low pH, the \n\ncharge distribution differs from that at pH 7.0, and apparently leads to differences in the \n\nquaternary structure and protein stability (Renkema, Lakemond, de Jongh, Gruppen &amp; van \n\nVliet, 2000). At pH 3.0 and low ionic strength most of the glycinin is in a 3S (1AB) form \n\nand part of the glycinin in a 7S form (Wolf et al., 1958). The low Tonset value (59.81 \u00b1 0.12 \n\n\u00baC) observed for SPI at pH 3.0 was similar to that obtained by Puppo et al. (2004) for ?-\n\nconglycinin (63.00 \u00b1 0.31 \u00baC) and glycinin (59 \u00b1 0.23 \u00baC) at pH 3.0, and also by Renkema, \n\nGruppen and van Vliet (2002) for ?-conglycinin (55\u00baC) at pH 3.0. A comparison of these \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 3rd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 152\n\nvalues suggests that the single peak observed could indicate a superimposed transition of \n\nthe dissociated 11S fraction and the ?-conglycinin. The 3S form of glycinin does not give a \n\ncooperative transition (Danilenko et al., 1987), which implies that heat stability of the 7S \n\nglycinin is not very high and that it unfolds before ?-conglycinin. All the transitions \n\nobserved were irreversible since during the second heating scan, no transitions could be \n\nobserved under any of the conditions studied. \n\n3.3. Properties of heat-induced soy protein-xanthan gels \n\n3.3.1. Protein solubility of gels and SDS-PAGE of gel extracts \n\nFigure 5 shows the solubility of SPI gels and SPI gels with xanthan and/or KCl in \n\nseveral extraction media. Intermediate concentrations of the ingredients in the 23- factorial \n\ndesign, were used to prepare the gels, and a gel with only SPI was used as the control. \n\nRegarding the gels containing xanthan, the amount of soluble protein in B (buffer pH 8.0) \n\nwas slightly greater then in the gels without polysaccharide. This trend could be attributed \n\nto disruption of the electrostatic interactions between the negative sites of xanthan and the \n\npositive regions of SPI at pH 3.0. For the others buffers (BU and BM) it was not observed \n\nany effect on the solubility with the addition of xanthan in SPI or SPI-KCl gels. Thus, the \n\nanalyses of soluble proteins in DW (deionized water) and in BUM (buffer + urea + ?-\n\nmercaptoethanol) were only carried out for the SPI and SPI-KCl gels, since xanthan could \n\nonly interact via electrostatic forces.  \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 3rd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 153\n\n \n\nFigure 5. Solubility of the protein constituents of different heat-induced gels at pH 3.0: SPI \n\n(12%), SPI (12%) \u2013 KCl (0.14 M), SPI (12%) \u2013 xanthan (0.135 %), SPI (12%) \u2013 xanthan \n\n(0.135 %) \u2013 KCl (0.14 M). Extraction solutions: (DW) deionised water; (B) buffer (pH \n\n8.0); (BU) buffer (pH 8.0) plus urea; (BM) buffer (pH 8.0) plus ?-mercaptoethanol; (BUM) \n\nbuffer (pH 8.0) plus urea and ?-mercaptoethanol. *SPI-xanthan and SPI-xanthan-KCl gels \n\nwere not evaluated due to the absence of samples. \n\nThe amount of soluble protein in the gels prepared with KCl (SPI-KCl and SPI-\n\nKCl-xanthan) in DW and BM media was different from that obtained for the gels without \n\nsalt. The protein solubility in DW decreased from 19 to 8% when the gel was prepared with \n\nKCl, which could be attributed to the salting out effect (Hermansson, 1978). Protein \n\nconstituents of the SPI-KCl gel were more soluble in B (?25%) than in DW, but for the gel \n\nwithout KCl the solubility of the proteins in B (?22%) was similar to that obtained in DW \n\n(?19%). The above results could suggest that the addition of salt favors indirectly the \n\nhydrophobic interactions, due to electrostatic interactions between counterions of the salt \n\nand protein macroions. \n\nFigure 5 also shows that the amount of soluble protein constituents in gels without \n\nKCl was similar (?60%) in BU and BM.

It is interesting to note \n\nthat the sum of the effect of each reagent on protein solubility was equal to 100% for gels \n\nwithout KCl, but when salt was present this sum was lower than 70%. Thus, two hypothesis \n\ncan be suggested: 1) the salt could hinder the formation of SS bonds, in agreement with \n\nother studies with SPI gels under acidic conditions, in which little or no formation of SS \n\nbonds was found (Puppo, Lupano &amp; A\u00f1\u00f3n, 1995); 2) there could be equal amounts of SS \n\nbonds in gels with and without KCl, but the reducing agent was unable to reach all the SS \n\nbonds in the gels with salt. However, the solubility in BUM was almost 100% in all gels, \n\nindicating the presence of more disulfide bonds in gels with KCl than was revealed by \n\nextraction in BM, confirming hypothesis 2. The addition of urea unfolds the protein \n\nmolecules, leading to greater exposure of SS bonds, which favors the reduction reaction by \n\n?-mercaptoethanol (Petruccelli &amp; A\u00f1\u00f3n, 1995b). The lower amount of soluble proteins \n\nobserved in BM could result from the presence of large random aggregates formed by non-\n\ncovalent interactions (H-bonding and hydrophobic) and SS bonds that were somehow \n\nlocalized inside the core. In addition, these aggregates would be large (>0.2 \u00b5m according \n\nto Lakemond, de Jongh, Paques, van Vliet, Gruppen and Voragen (2003)) such that they \n\nprecipitated when the system was centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 15 min at 25\u00b0C. The results \n\nindicated that SPI-xanthan gels prepared without KCl were mainly stabilized by non-\n\ncovalent (H-bonding and hydrophobic) and SS bond interactions, whereas in gels with KCl, \n\nelectrostatic interactions were also involved in maintaining the gel structure. \n\nThe effects of xanthan and KCl on the subunit composition of soluble proteins as \n\nwell as on the formation of high molecular weight aggregates were evaluated from the \n\nelectrophoretic patterns of the soluble proteins in the different buffers. Figure 6 shows the \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 3rd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 155\n\nelectrophoretic patterns using non-reducing conditions for the DW and BU extracts. The \n\nresults for the B extract were similar to those of the BU (not shown) one. The different \n\ncomponents present in the SPI powder were identified by comparison with molecular \n\nweight markers and with the literature results (Petruccelli &amp; A\u00f1\u00f3n, 1995c). The bands \n\nfound in the SPI powder under non-reducing conditions (with ?-mercaptoethanol) were: ? \n\nand ?\u2019 subunits of ?-conglycinin (?? and ?\u2019-7S); ? subunit of ?-conglycinin (??7S); acidic \n\npolypeptides of glycinin (A-11S) and basic polypeptides of glycinin (B-11S) and the AB \n\nsubunit of glycinin (AB-11S). Low molecular weight fractions (**) and four bands of large \n\nsoluble aggregates (*) with molecular weights above 115.5 kDa were also observed (Figure \n\n6). Petruccelli and A\u00f1\u00f3n (1995c) previously suggested that the ? and ?\u2019 subunits of the ?-\n\nconglycinin probably formed the aggregates present in the two first bands (greater \n\nintensity). The other two bands would contain the latter subunits plus the A polypeptide of \n\n11S. \n\nThe DW extract (lane 3) showed two bands with high intensity corresponding to the \n\nAB subunit of glycinin and to the ?-subunit of ?-conglycinin. There were also small \n\namounts of low molecular weight peptides (25.9-37.1 kDa) and traces of free ??7S, ?\u2019-7S, \n\nA-11S and B-11S subunits. The presence of soluble AB-11S revealed that the disulfide \n\nbridge between the A and B polypeptides was not broken, which was attributed to the low \n\nreactivity of the SS-SH interchange at this low pH (Shimada &amp; Cheftel, 1988). The material \n\ndissolved in BU consisted of three major proteins that entered the gel and were associated \n\nwith the A and B polypeptides of glycinin and the ? subunit of ?-conglycinin. In addition, a \n\nhigh molecular weight aggregate (1) was observed, that migrated into the stacking but not \n\ninto the separating gel, and a second aggregate (2), that did not migrate into the stacking \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 3rd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 156\n\ngel. The aggregate-2 was probably 1) a new aggregate formed during the gelation process; \n\n2) the hexameric form of glycinin (300-380 kDa), since the A-11S and B-11S bands \n\nshowed lower intensities, compared to those under reducing conditions (results not shown). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.

Figure 7 shows the statistical comparison among different types of mixed \n\nbiopolymer gels, of the amounts of soluble fractions dissolved in B or BM. In this Figure, \n\nthe protein composition of the SPI gels (with or without KCl) extracted by BUM, was \n\nreferred to as the standard composition, giving 12.2% ?-7S, 12% ?\u2019-7S, 16.4% ?-7S, \n\n32.8% A-11S, 26.6% B-11S. The soluble proteins of the gels in BU showed a similar \n\ncomposition (p<0.1). However, the subunit composition of the proteins soluble in B and \n\nBM were different from the standard (Figure 7).

Regarding the BM extracts (Figure 7B), an increase in the proportion of A-\n\n11S and a decrease in B-11S polypeptides was observed, whilst the others did not change. \n\nThis means that the addition of KCl resulted in a higher proportion of A-11S linked by SS \n\nbonds. One possible interpretation of these results is that the random aggregation of \n\nproteins promoted the self-association of A-11S or its linkage with the ? and ?\u2019-7S \n\npolypeptide (Petruccelli &amp; A\u00f1\u00f3n, 1995c). The B-11S fraction could be self-associated due \n\nto its more hydrophobic character, showing a lower proportion of SS bond linkages. Figure \n\n7A also shows a decrease in the A-11S polypeptide and an increase in the ?-7S subunit \n\nwhen xanthan was added to the SPI gels.

CSLM and macroscopic properties of gels \n\nAn indication of the type of gel network formed is given by the appearance of the \n\ngels. The initial mixed solution was translucent and became opaque on acidification. Near \n\nthe pI (pH ?4.0-5.0) the solution was highly opaque with granular aggregates of different \n\nsizes. Beyond this point, these particles were re-dissolved, but the solution remained \n\nslightly opaque. At pH 3.0 the gels made with KCl were opaque and those prepared without \n\nthe salt showed an appearance between a yellowish transparent and a slightly opaque gel. \n\nOpaque gels are formed when fluctuations in polymer density approach macroscopic size \n\nand effectively scatter light. On the other hand, transparent gels have an almost \n\nhomogeneous network (Oakenfull, Pearce &amp; Burley, 1997).

White and gray areas in the pictures represent \n\nprotein, while black areas represent the pores of the network containing the continuous \n\nphase without protein. In the gel without salt, the fluorescent signal was uniform \n\nthroughout the sample, indicating that the SPI particles were homogeneously distributed \n\n(Figure 8A). This gel could be categorized as fine-stranded (Foegeding, Bowland &amp; \n\nHarding, 1995). \n\nThe effect of increasing ionic strength on the microstructure of the gel matrix was \n\nobserved when 0.14 M KCl was added (Figure 8B). Monovalent chloride ions induce the \n\nformation of a fine stranded matrix at ionic strength values below 0.1 M (Totosaus, \n\nMontejano, Salazar &amp; Guerrero, 2002). Figure 8B shows a mixed structure predominantly \n\nformed by random bright aggregates with different sizes and shapes, but also showing \n\nregions resembling the fine structure of Figure 8A (below the line). Renkema (2004) \n\nreported a soy protein gel (pH 3.8) with coarse microstructure at a slightly higher ionic \n\nstrength, but with smaller aggregates as compared to those obtained in SPI-xanthan-KCl \n\ngels (Figure 8B). At pH 3.0, the most likely interaction involving the two biopolymers was \n\nthat between the positively charged regions on the proteins and the negatively charged \n\ncarboxyl groups of the xanthan. The addition of salt (Figure 8B) resulted in screening of the \n\nexclusion volume effect and a coupled network with both biopolymers was probably \n\nformed. The SPI-xanthan gel also showed some regions nearly devoid of protein, which \n\ncould be due to the presence of xanthan. \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 3rd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 160\n\nFigure 8.

Scale bars in \u00b5m. \n\nGel properties, which depend on the pH and ionic strength of the system, are closely \n\nrelated to the type of protein structure (Foegeding, Bowland &amp; Harding, 1995). Figure 9 \n\nshows the water holding capacity (WHC), strain at fracture, Young modulus and stress at \n\nfracture of SPI-xanthan gels as a function of KCl content. The composition of the gels \n\nwithout KCl was chosen according to the 22-factorial design (SPI-xanthan). Gels with the \n\nsame composition and containing the lowest (0.01 M) and highest (0.27 M) KCl \n\nconcentrations were also investigated, corresponding to the negative (-1) and positive (+1) \n\nsalt levels of the 23-factorial design (Table 1). The effects of these variables on the gel \n\nproperties were statistically analyzed, these results being used to better understand the \n\ntendencies shown in Figure 9. Figure 9A shows that the xanthan and KCl concentrations \n\nwere the main factors responsible for the changes in the WHC values. In the systems \n\nwithout salt, an increase in xanthan content changed the WHC from ~50% to ~70%, while \n\nat the highest KCl concentration, all the values were lower and closer, about 30-40%.

Figure 9C shows that the xanthan concentration had a negative effect on the Young \n\nmodulus values in gels without KCl, but at the highest salt concentration, the \n\npolysaccharide had a positive effect. The KCl concentration had a great effect on the \n\nYoung modulus, especially at high xanthan concentrations. The values increased from ~4-5 \n\nkPa to ~15-18 kPa with the addition of 0.27 M KCl. \n\nFigures 9A and 9B show that the WHC and strain at fracture first increased with the \n\naddition of 0.01 M KCl and then decreased when more KCl (0.27 M) was added to systems \n\nwith low xanthan concentrations. However, at the higher xanthan concentrations, the WHC \n\nand strain values did not show such an initial increase, decreasing with the addition of any \n\nKCl concentration. This fact could be explained by an intensification of the solute effect, \n\nsince there was less water available in the system due to the high capacity of xanthan to \n\nbind water. The behavior described above was probably due to salting-in and salting-out \n\neffects. For systems without KCl, it was observed a positive effect of xanthan on WHC, \n\nsince polysaccharides are good water binders. This corroborates to the above hypothesis of \n\nintensification of the solute effect at high xanthan content. \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 3rd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 162\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n0.00 0.01 0.27\nKCl (M)\n\nW\nH\n\nC\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nX=0.05%\n\nX=0.3%\n\nA\n \n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0 0.01 0.27\nKCl (M)\n\nS\ntr\n\nai\nn \n\nat\n fr\n\nac\ntu\n\nre\n (\n\n-)\n\nX=0.3%\n\nX=0.05%\n\nB\n \n\n2\n\n6\n\n10\n\n14\n\n18\n\n0 0.01 0.27\nKCl (M)\n\nY\nou\n\nng\n m\n\nod\nul\n\nus\n (\n\nkP\na)\n\nX=0.05%\n\nX=0.3%\n\nC\n \n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n0 0.01 0.27\nKCl (M)\n\nS\ntr\n\nes\ns \n\nat\n fr\n\nac\ntu\n\nre\n (\n\nkP\na)\n\nX=0.05%\n\nX=0.3%\n\nD\n \n\nFigure 9. Variation in the water holding capacity (A), strain at fracture (B), Young modulus \n\n(C) and stress at fracture (D) at three KCl concentrations. X is the xanthan concentration: \n\n0.05 wt% (?, ?), 0.3 wt% (?, ?). SPI: 10 wt% (?, ?), 14 wt% (?, ?). \n\nAt low salt concentration or ionic strength values below 0.1 M (Hermansson, 1978), \n\nions of neutral salts may increase the solubility of soy proteins (salting-in) by reacting with \n\nthe charged sites, resulting in an increase in the water holding capacity of the gels. \n\nHowever, at higher salt concentrations, protein solubility decreases (salting-out) as a result \n\nof competition between the protein and the salt ions for the water molecules (Cheftel et al., \n\n1996). The latter effect results in random protein aggregation and a gel with low WHC, \n\nsince gels with large pores inhibit the capacity to immobilize solvent via capillary forces \n\n(Ziegler &amp; Foegeding, 1990). Such an event was better observed for systems with high \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 3rd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 163\n\nprotein and polysaccharide concentrations. The strain at fracture showed exactly the same \n\ntendencies as the WHC as a function of KCl concentration, for all systems (Figure 9B). It is \n\nknown that a more aggregated structure (salting out effect) leads to a less elastic network \n\n(Foegeding, Bowland &amp; Harding, 1995). \n\nThe Young modulus values rose with increasing salt content for systems with high \n\nxanthan contents, while showing a minimum value at 0.01 M KCl for gels with a low \n\npolysaccharide concentration (Figure 9C). This tendency was the opposite of that observed \n\nfor strain at fracture. The great increase in the Young modulus values at high xanthan and \n\nKCl concentrations could be due to the more elastic character of xanthan solutions at low \n\ndeformations (Figure 3), with the addition of salt. The stress at fracture values (Figure 9D) \n\nshowed almost the same tendency observed for the Young modulus. The different \n\nbehaviors at high salt content could be attributed to the deformation scale from which the \n\nproperties were obtained. The Young modulus is a small deformation property and gives \n\nmore information about the linkage of biopolymers. Stress at fracture is obtained at large \n\ndeformations such that not only the strength of the strands is important but also the size of \n\nthe holes. Figure 8B shows that even for 0.14 M KCl there are holes of about 90 x 40 \u00b5m. \n\nAbove a certain size, the holes probably made the network more fragile, as observed by the \n\ndrop in stress at fracture. \n\nFor systems without salt, the stress at fracture decreased with the increase of \n\nxanthan concentration (Figure 9D). It was discussed above (Figure 7) that xanthan probably \n\npreferentially interacted with ?-7S. In addition, the confocal microstructure of SPI-xanthan \n\ngel showed some regions nearly devoid of protein. Thus, it can be suggested that at least \n\n\n\nChapter 4\u2013 3rd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 164\n\npart of xanthan and ?-7S were not in the main protein network, which would induce the \n\nreduction of the gel hardness. \n\n \n\n4. Conclusions \n\nThe increase in KCl content led to more elastic xanthan solutions, and such \n\nbehavior can be attributed to the ordered conformation of this polysaccharide. At pH 3.0, \n\nall 7S and 11S subunits seemed to participate in the network, although they were associated \n\nin different ways depending on the composition of the gels (with or without KCl or \n\nxanthan). The ?-7S subunit was probably the fraction electrostatically linked to the \n\nxanthan. It was suggested that at least part of xanthan and ?-7S were not in the main protein \n\nnetwork, which would induce the reduction of the gel hardness for gels without KCl. The \n\naddition of KCl to SPI gels affected the mechanical properties of the gels and their water \n\nholding capacity, which was explained by the salting in and salting out effects. Gels with \n\nlow amounts of ingredients were more deformable and showed greater WHC, salting-in \n\neffects being observed. When the content of one of the ingredients (KCl or xanthan) was \n\nincreased, the salting-out effect occurred. \n\n \n\n5.

The \n\nresults showed that SPI was more hydrophobic than the Na-caseinate, which induced the \n\ngelation of the protein rich phase after centrifugation of SPI \u2013 Na-alginate and SPI \u2013 ?-\n\ncarrageenan systems. However, gellan did not induce the gel formation, indicating that this \n\npolysaccharide could be used as thickening in soy products. The results indicated that ?-\n\ncarrageenan was more compatible with both soy protein and Na-caseinate than alginate. \n\nThe confocal micrographs revealed different degree of separation for a fixed centrifugation \n\ncondition (60000 x g during 1 h). This suggests that the centrifugation conditions should be \n\ncarefully chose for each protein-polysaccharide mixture. The rheological behaviour of the \n\nsystems varied from a diluted solution to a gel passing through the formation of water-in-\n\nwater emulsions. In addition, it was suggested that the storage modulus value of the protein \n\nrich-phase can be used as an indicator of the degree of phase separation. \n\nKeywords: proteins, polysaccharides, CLSM, rheology, phase separation. \n\n \n\n1. Introduction \n\nFrom the last two decades, the food industries are putting great effort on developing \n\nnew products with attractive textures. Different types of polysaccharides and proteins have \n\nbeen added to milk products in order to partially replace the fat or sugar. Soy proteins have \n\nbeen applied in a wide range of food products especially because of their ability to form \n\ngels with good water holding capacity on heating, showing great potential in the \n\nsubstitution of meat and dairy proteins (Van Vliet et al., 2002). Carrageenans are the most \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 172\n\nused polysaccharides in dairy products, altough the mechanism of compatibility of this \n\nseaweed, anionic and linear polysaccharide with milk proteins remains in discussion \n\n(Spagnuolo et al., 2005). Other seaweed, anionic and linear polysaccharides that have been \n\nreceiving great attention from the industry are the alginates that show a good water-in-\n\nwater emulsion capacity (Capron et al., 2001, Antonov et al., 2004). Among the microbial \n\npolysaccharides, gellan is widely utilized in the industries due to its ability to form clear \n\nand heat- and acid-resistant thermoreversible gels with aqueous media. In addition, from a \n\nscientific point of view, it is often regarded as a model system for investigating gelation \n\nmechanisms of helix-forming polysaccharides such as agarose and carrageenans (Ikeda et \n\nal., 2004). \n\nProteins and polysaccharides are usually incompatible showing segregative phase \n\nseparation at pH 7.0. The conditions necessary for phase separation vary according to the \n\nbiopolymers and the presence of co-solutes. They are dependent on specific structure and \n\ncompositional features, as well as on the molecular weight and conformation of the \n\nbiopolymers (Zeman and Patterson, 1972). The phase behaviour of proteins and \n\npolysaccharides has received attention in the last decade and the works have been \n\nespecially done by Tolstogusov and others (Polyakov et al., 1980; Grinberg and \n\nTolstoguzov, 1997; Tolstoguzov, 2003). The most studied mixtures in the last years has \n\nused gelatin or skim milk as protein source, but few works were done using soy proteins.  \n\nThe rheological behaviour of aqueous biopolymer mixtures is quite different from \n\nthat of a pure biopolymer solution due to the hydrodynamic influence of the dispersed \n\nphase (Palierne, 1990, Simeone et al., 2002). The morphology of the system can add \n\ninformation to the rheological description of the biopolymers mixtures. The confocal \n\nmicroscopy is especially important to give information about the dispersed phase shape, \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 173\n\ndistribution and volume fraction. In addition, it can give support to the choices of the \n\ncentrifugation parameters. \n\nThe aim of this work was to understand the role of different biopolymers and its \n\nconcentration on the phase behaviour of a protein-polysaccharide system. The \n\npolysaccharides investigated were gellan, ?-carrageenan and Na-alginate, while sodium \n\ncaseinate and soy protein isolate were the proteins source. In addition, the rheological \n\nproperties of the initial mixture and the separated phases were measured and the \n\nmicrostructures of those systems were observed under confocal laser scanning microscope.  \n\n2. Material and methods \n\n2.1. Material \n\nThe proteins used to prepare the model systems were casein (Sigma Chemical Co., \n\nUSA) and soy protein isolate (SPI) obtained from defatted soy flour (Bunge Alimentos \n\nS.A., Brazil). The polysaccharides used were sodium (Na)-alginate, ?-carrageenan, and \n\ngellan, all of them obtained from CP Kelco (USA). Table 1 shows the chemical \n\ncharacterization of each biopolymer. The moisture and ash contents were determined using \n\nthe gravimetric method, in which the initial and final samples were weighed. The ash was \n\nobtained by heating the powder at 550oC until it becomes a carbon-free sample (AOAC, \n\n1996). For moisture analysis the powder was dried in a vacuum-oven at 60 oC until the \n\nsample weight reached a constant value. The protein content was carried out using the \n\nKjeldahl method (AOAC, 1996). \n\nThe soy proteins isolation procedure followed the method described by Petruccelli \n\nand A\u00f1\u00f3n (1995). Defatted soy flour was dispersed in distilled water (1:10 w/w) and the pH \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 174\n\nwas adjusted to 8.0 with 2N NaOH. The dispersion was gently stirred for 2h at room \n\ntemperature and then centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 30 min at 4\u00baC in a Sorvall RC5 Plus \n\ncentrifuge (GSA-rotor, Dupont, UK). The supernatant was adjusted to pH 4.5 with 2N HCl \n\nand centrifuged at 5,000 x g (Sorvall GSA-rotor) for 15 min at 4\u00baC. The precipitate was \n\nthen suspended in water and the pH adjusted to 8.0 with 2N NaOH, followed by freeze-\n\ndrying of the suspension. \n\nTable 1.

Preparation of biopolymers stock solutions \n\nThe Na-caseinate solution was prepared by dispersing casein powder in milli-Q \n\nwater using magnetic stirring for 2 h at a maximum temperature of 50 oC. The pH was \n\nconstantly adjusted to 7.0 with 10M NaOH. The soy protein isolate (SPI) solution (milli-Q \n\nwater) was prepared at room temperature by magnetic stirring until the complete powder \n\nhydration and the pH was adjusted to 7.0 with 1M HCl. The polysaccharide solutions were \n\nprepared by first dispersing the powders in milli-Q water at room temperature by magnetic \n\nstirring and after heating in a water bath with a fixed temperature and time (Table 2). The \n\nprepared solutions were immediately cooled down to room temperature in an ice bath, and \n\nnone of them gelified after this process. The insoluble particles of proteins and \n\npolysaccharides solutions were separated by centrifugation in an ultracentrifuge L8-80 M \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 175\n\n(Beckman, USA) at 60,000 x g for 60 minutes at 25 \u00b0C (Antonov et al., 2004), except for ?-\n\ncarrageenan and gellan solutions that were already purified (without any insoluble \n\nparticles). The pH of all solutions was adjusted to 7.0. The concentrations of proteins, \n\nseadweeds polysaccharides and gellan solutions were 8%, 4% and 1% (w/w), respectively. \n\nTable 2.

Preparation of biopolymers mixtures and phase separation \n\nBiopolymer mixed solutions (MS) were obtained by mixing the purified solutions of \n\nprotein and polysaccharide during 1 h at room temperature by magnetic stirring. These \n\nsolutions were poured into polycarbonate tubes of 25 mL that were centrifuged in an \n\nultracentrifuge L8-80M (Beckman, USA) at 60,000 x g during 60 minutes (Antonov et al., \n\n2004). Two meniscus were marked on the outside of the centrifuge tubes in order to \n\ndetermine the amount (volume) of the protein and polysaccharide rich phases The phases \n\nwere then carefully withdrawn and stored in separate beakers for further analyses \n\n(rheology, CLSM and chemical analysis).  \n\nPreliminary studies (Apendice) on different protein-polysaccharides MS were \n\nconducted in order to determine the concentration of biopolymers that would lead to \n\nincompatible mixtures that form two equilibrium phases after centrifugation. The selected \n\nsystems are shown in Table 3. Almost all of the selected systems had similar zero shear \n\nviscosities of MS (estimated from the data obtained in Chapter 3-1st part). In addition, it \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 176\n\nwas studied two different compositions for SA and SC systems in order to understand the \n\nrole of the viscosity on the phase separation behaviour. \n\nTable 3.

Chemical analyses \n\nThe protein concentration was determined in triplicate by Kjeldahl method (AOAC, \n\n1996). The polysaccharide concentration was also determined in triplicate using the phenol-\n\nsulphuric acid reaction followed by the measurement of the solution light absorption in the \n\nvisible wavelength region (Dubois et al., 1956) using a Beckmann spectrophotometer \n\nDU/70 (Beckman, USA). The light absorption was made at three different wavelengths \n\ncorresponding to the points P1, P2 and P3 of Figure 1, which depended on the \n\npolysaccharide type. These values were determined from a previous wavelength scan in the \n\nvisible region. The calibration curves of the polysaccharides were obtained for \n\nconcentrations in the range of 10-100 \u00b5g/mL.  \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 177\n\n \n\nFigure 1.

The subscripts B, MS, PSrp and PRrp \n\nare, respectively, biopolymer (protein or polysaccharide), mixed solution, polysaccharide \n\nrich-phase and protein rich-phase. \n\n2.5. Volume ratio analysis \n\nThe volume ratio method was developed to obtain the binodal line for a liquid-\n\nliquid phase separation (Polyakov et al., 1980). However, some protein-polysaccharide \n\nmixtures resulted in a liquid-gel phase separation, such that the precision of the above \n\nmethod was checked (Results and Discussion section). The volume of each phase was \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 178\n\nquantified by filling the centrifuge tube with water up to the meniscus marks and weighing \n\nthe amount of water added. The Equation 3 was used for further analysis: \n\nVRexp =\nVPSrp\nVtot\n\n (3) \n\nwhere VRexp is the volume ratio determined experimentally from the meniscus marks, VPSrp \n\nis the volume of the polysaccharide rich phase and Vtot is the total volume of the mixture \n\nSM1. \n\nThe lever-arm rule (Antonov et al., 2004) was used to check the experimental \n\nvolume data above (Equations 4, 5 and 6). The density of each phase was considered to be \n\n1 g/cm3 for the calculations since the density of the most concentrated phase was 1.06 \n\ng/cm3 (Chapter 3-1st part). \n\nVRcalc =\nVPSrp\nV\n\ntot\n\n=\nA\nB\n\n (4) \n\nA = XPRrp ?

Rheological tests \n\nA stress-controlled rheometer (Carri-Med CSL2500, TA Instruments, England) was \n\nused to accomplish the steady and oscillatory rheological measurements. The initial mixture \n\n(MS) and the protein and polysaccharide rich-phases were placed on the rheometer and the \n\nmeasurements were made in triplicate at 25 \u00b0C. Cone-plate, rough plate-plate or double \n\nconcentric cylinder geometry (Table 4) were used depending on the sample. The double \n\nconcentric cylinders were used for samples with zero shear viscosity (?0) lower than 0.8 \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 179\n\nPa.s. The cone-plate geometry was chosen for the samples with ?0 values in the range of \n\n0.8-10 Pa.s. The rough plate-plate was used for high viscous samples (?0 > 10 Pa.s) and for \n\nthose systems that showed slippage due to syneresis. \n\nTable 4.

Steady shear flow curves \n\nFlow curves were obtained by applying an up-down-up steps program using \n\ndifferent shear stress range to each sample. This range was determined from a shear rate-\n\ncontrol experiment, in which the maximum shear rate was 300 [s-1]. At each programmed \n\nstep 150 points were measured. The last step (steady flow) was taken to plot the apparent \n\nviscosity (?) versus shear rate.  \n\n2.6.2. Dynamic oscillatory measurements \n\nA stress sweep test was carried out at 25 \u00baC and constant frequency of 0.1 Hz, for \n\nevery sample, in order to find out the limit of the linear viscoelastic zone. Frequency \n\nsweeps were done from 0.02 to 10 Hz at 25 \u00baC at a fixed stress within the linear viscoelastic \n\nrange. The storage (G\u2019(?)) and loss (G\u201d(?)) moduli were plotted as a function of \n\nfrequency. \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 180\n\n2.7. Confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) \n\nThe initial protein-polysaccharide mixture (MS) and the protein and polysaccharide \n\nrich-phases were observed under confocal laser scanning microscope (CSLM). Rhodamine \n\nB was added and mixed carefully with about 1 mL of sample. Such a fluorescent dye was \n\nused in order to stain the protein. The samples were placed in indentations of microscope \n\nslides, covered with a glass cover slip and sealed with nail polish to prevent evaporation. A \n\ndual-channel laser confocal system (MRC 1024 UV, Biorad, USA) mounted on an Axiovert \n\n100 Zeiss inverted microscope and equipped with Ar-Kr lasers was used for the trials. The \n\nAr-Kr lasers emitted polarized light with a wavelength of 568 nm exciting the Rhodamine-\n\nlabeled proteins. Images were taken using a 40x water immersion objective and a 100x oil \n\nimmersion objective. To obtain a representative structure 15 micrographs of each sample \n\nwere taken. The sizes of the inclusions (highest length or area) were quantified using the \n\nsoftware Image J. for Macintosh. \n\n \n\n3. Results and discussion \n\n3.1. Visual appearance and volume ratio of biopolymers mixed solution after \n\ncentrifugation. \n\nThe visual appearance of the mixtures (MS) after centrifugation in test tubes at \n\n60000 x g during 60 minutes at 25 \u00b0C can be observed in Figure 2. All mixed solutions \n\n(MS), excluding the CG mixture formed a transparent and liquid polysaccharide rich phase \n\n(PSrp) after centrifugation at the top of the tube. The CG-PSrp was a translucent gel (1.6% of \n\npolysaccharide) that easily broke releasing water. This could be explained by the gellan \n\nability to form brittle gels at concentrations higher than 1%. The mixtures containing ?-\n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 181\n\ncarrageenan (CC, SC) and the SA mixture formed opaque and gelified protein rich-phases \n\n(PRrp) at the bottom of the tubes. Such gels were apparently harder for the SPI systems, \n\nwhile the CC-PRrp gel was a more deformable one. The mixed systems containing gellan \n\n(CG and SG) formed a liquid PRrp.

Visual appearance of the mixtures after centrifugation at 60000g during 60 min. \n\nThe analysis of the volume ratio adds information for the determination of the tie-\n\nlines of a phase diagram. The volume ratio method was developed for a liquid-liquid phase \n\nseparation (Polyakov et al., 1980). However, some protein-polysaccharide mixtures \n\nresulted in a liquid-gel phase separation (Figure 2), being necessary to check the precision \n\nof the mentioned method. The experimental phase volume ratio (VRexp) was determined \n\nusing the measured volumes of the phases (Table 5). The volume ratio was also calculated \n\n(VRcalc) based on the protein concentration of MS, PSrp and PRrp. A specific procedure to \n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 183\n\nwithdraw the phases was done for each mixture, as the separated phases showed different \n\nproperties (Figure 2). The top and bottom phases separated from CA and CC mixtures were \n\nwithdrawn by means of a pipette. For SA and SC mixtures the top phase was taken out by \n\nmeans of a pipette and the gelified bottom phase was removed with a spatula. The gelified \n\nCG-PSrp was taken out before the liquid protein rich-phase. The SG mixture probably had \n\nvery low interfacial tension as it was easily remixed. Thus, it was first withdrawn half of \n\nthe PSrp, then the whole PRrp and finally the rest of the PSrp using pipettes. \n\nTable 5. Volume ratio obtained by measuring the phase volume (VRexp) and calculated \n\nfrom protein concentration in each phase (VRcalc). \n\n CA CC CG SA2 SC2 SG \n\nVRexp [%] 81.70 \u00b1 1.20 70.64 \u00b1 0.41 17.42 \u00b1 3.53 91.98 \u00b1 0.32 86.93 \u00b1 1.05 76.90 \u00b1 0.51 \n\nVRcalc [%] 79.93 68.17 5.37 91.59 86.10 84.93 \n\n \nThe systems of CA, CC, SA2 and SC2 exhibited differences between VRcalc and \n\nVRexp lower than 2.5%. The differences between VRcalc and VRexp for the systems \n\ncontaining gellan were 8% (SG) and 12% (CG). Such differences would be related to the \n\ndifficult to withdraw the phases, which affected the determination of biopolymers \n\nconcentration. In addition, the volume measurement of the CG system was not easy \n\nbecause the phase boundary showed some flat parts and others with an inclination (Figure \n\n2c). However, in spite of the experimental difficulties, it can be considered that the results \n\nshowed a reasonable agreement. In this way, it can be concluded that the visual method for \n\nvolume determination was very good and that in some cases it could be extended to gelified \n\nsystems. It is also interesting to note that the range of VR as between 70-90%, except for \n\nCG mixture. This revealed that the volumes of the polysaccharide phase were usually much \n\nhigher than the volume of PRrp due to the higher hydrophilic character of the \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 184\n\npolysaccharides as compared with proteins. In the CG system this did not happen because \n\nof the gelling ability of gellan at high concentration, such that polymer-polymer \n\ninteractions would prevail over the polymer-water one. \n\n3.2. Chemical analysis, rheology and microscopy of MS systems and their rich-phases \n\nIn the following sections it will be discussed the rheological and phase behaviour of \n\nMS systems. The degree of separation achieved by centrifugation was evaluated by \n\nexamining samples of the top and bottom phase under a confocal microscope and by \n\nchemical characterization of protein and polysaccharide content. \n\n3.2.1. SPI - Na-alginate mixtures \n\nFigure 3 shows the tie-line of the SA2 system obtained by chemical analyses of MS, \n\nPRrp and PSrp and the corresponding micrographs made with CSLM. The protein and \n\npolysaccharide concentrations were respectively 3.0% and 2.5% for MS, 1.2% and 2.6% \n\nfor PSrp and 22.5% and 1.0% for PRrp, with a mass balance relative error smaller than 4%. \n\nThe micrographs show white areas that contain fluorescent protein stained by Rhodamine \n\nB, while the dark areas indicate the absence of protein. The micrograph of MS sample \n\nshowed a polysaccharide continuous phase containing several irregular shaped protein \n\naggregates with sizes lower than 10 \u00b5m. Fluorescence was regularly distributed for PRrp \n\nsample indicating that the protein was homogenously distributed in the sample. Black \n\nregions devoid of protein can be pointing out to the presence of concentrated \n\npolysaccharide (the maximum region size of 6 \u00b5m). The PSrp contained spherical protein \n\naggregates with diameters up to 4 \u00b5m  (Figure 3). The equilibrium between the phases is \n\nachieved when both phases are free of inclusions even when observed at high \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 185\n\nmagnification, such as 100x (Simeone et al., 2004). Thus, the previous structural \n\nobservations of PRrp and PSrp indicated that complete separation was not reached with the \n\ncentrifugation conditions used here. \n\nFigure 3. Confocal micrographs at 25 oC of the mixed solution, protein and polysaccharide \n\nrich phases of SA2 (SPI - Na-alginate) system. Squares are experimentally determined \n\nbiopolymer concentrations of MS, PRrp and PSrp. The light regions in the micrographs \n\nindicate protein area, scale bar = 50\u00b5m. \n\nDynamic (Figure 4a) and steady state (Figure 4b) rheological measurements were \n\nperformed for the SA2 system. The mixed solution and the PSrp exhibited similar \n\nrheological properties at both small and high deformation measurements. The mechanical \n\nspectrum of these samples showed diluted solution behaviour with loss modulus (G\u2019\u2019) \n\nhigher than storage modulus (G\u2019) over the entire frequency range, but approaching each \n\nother at higher frequencies without moduli crossover (Steffe, 1996). Flow curves for these \n\nsamples (Figure 4b) exhibited Newtonian behaviour up to 10 s-1, with a constant apparent \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 186\n\nviscosity (?) value of 0.8 Pa.s. In addition, a slightly shear-thinning behaviour was \n\ndeveloped at higher shear rate values. The protein rich phase behaved as gel-like materials \n\n(Figure 4a) with the G\u2019 values higher than G\u2019\u2019 values, although at low frequencies G\u2019 was \n\nonly two times greater than G\u2019\u2019. This protein phase was shear-thinning and it was not \n\npossible to observe the zero shear viscosity value in the studied shear rate range (Figure \n\n4b). In addition, it was observed thixotropy in such systems (results not shown) probably \n\ndue to the rupture or rearrangements of the gel network after shear. \n\n  \n\nFigure 4. Frequency sweep (a) and flow curve (b) for SA2 system (SPI 3% \u2013 Na-alginate \n\n2.5%) mixed solution (?) and the rich protein (?) and polysaccharide (?) phases after \n\ncentrifugation at 60000g for 1h. Closed symbols correspond to G\u2019(?) and open symbols \n\ncorrespond to G\u201d(?) or ?. \n\nA second SA mixture (SA1) containing lower amount of polysaccharide (1.5%) was \n\nexamined through CLSM to check the effect of polysaccharide/protein ratio on the degree \n\nof phase separation. In addition, the rheological behaviour of this system before and after \n\ncentrifugation was examined at small and high deformations. The structure of PRrp from \n\nSA1 (Figure 5) resembled to the micrograph observed for PRrp from SA2 (Figure 3). \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 187\n\nHowever, less dark regions could be detected in the protein rich phase of SA1, indicating a \n\nbetter phase separation. The reduction of the polysaccharide content in MS did not have a \n\nstrong effect on the dynamic rheological behaviour (Figure 6a). The G\u2019 and G\u2019\u2019 curves for \n\nprotein and the polysaccharide rich phases were shifted to lower values.  \n\n \n\nFigure 5. CLSM micrograph of PRrp obtained from SA1 mixture \n\n  \n\nFigure 6.

The lower viscosity of the MS probably assisted a higher degree of phase \n\nseparation during centrifugation as noticed in Figure 5. The PRrp\u2013SA1 showed a different \n\nbehaviour, being observed two plateau regions. The first one at low shear rate corresponded \n\nto the zero shear viscosity, whereas the second one could be attributed to slippery effects \n\n(Pal, 2000) due to syneresis observed visually. In addition, the viscosity of PRrp of SA1 was \n\ngreater than that of SA2 independent of the shear rate. This could be attributed to a more \n\ninterconnected protein network, with less polysaccharide inclusions and is another \n\nindication of the greater degree of phase separation achieved in SA1 as compared to SA2. \n\n3.2.2. SPI - carrageenan mixtures \n\nThe biopolymer concentrations of all SC1 and SC2 systems were measured and \n\nplotted (Figure 7). The content of protein (Cpr) and polysaccharide (Cps) of the SC2 system \n\nwas respectively 3.1% and 2.2% in the mixed solution, 16.2% and 1.7% in the protein rich \n\nphase and 1.0% and 2.4% in the polysaccharide rich phase, with the mass balances error \n\nlower than 6%. The Cpr and Cps of the SC1-system were, respectively, 3.0% and 1.4% in \n\nMS, 14.3% and 1.0% in the protein rich phase and 1.3% and 1.4% in the polysaccharide \n\nrich phase, with the mass balances error lower than 4.5%.The position of the tie-lines \n\nindicated that the phase separation of the SC2-system was not complete, since the PRrp of \n\nSC2 and SC1 could never be onto the same binodal. Tolstoguzov (1995) described that the \n\ntie-lines for a ternary protein-polysaccharide-water system could be asymmetric. In \n\naddition, the tie-lines could converge into a single point for gelling systems. \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 189\n\n \nFigure 7. Confocal micrographs at 25 oC of the mixed solution, protein- and \n\npolysaccharide-rich phases of SC1 and SC2 (SPI \u2013 Carrageenan) systems. Closed symbols \n\nare experimentally determined biopolymer concentrations of MS, PRrp and PSrp. The light \n\nregions in the micrographs indicate protein area, scale bar = 50\u00b5m. \n\nThe mixed solution of SC2 showed both irregular shaped (&lt;10 \u00b5m) and spherical \n\n(diameter &lt;15 \u00b5m) aggregates of protein. In contrast, mixed solution of SC1 did not \n\ncontain spherical aggregates but only irregular shaped ones, which formed bigger and \n\nelongated secondary structures with up to 30 \u00b5m length. The lower viscosity of SC1 \n\nassociated with the lower amount of polysaccharide in the mixed solution (see Figures 8 \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 190\n\nand 9 below) probably let to the formation of protein assemblies. In addition, Simeone et al. \n\n(2004) showed that the interfacial tension between the coexisting phases has a direct linear \n\ndependence with the length of the tie-line, which could explain the formation of spherical \n\nprotein inclusion in the initial mixture of SC2. The micrograph of PSrp of SC2 showed \n\ninclusions of protein with a size up to 2 \u00b5m, whereas the micrograph of PSrp of SC1 was \n\nblack and devoid of protein. That was another evidence for the lower level of phase \n\nseparation for SC2. A gelified particulated structure could be observed for PRrp (Figures 2 \n\nand 7) in contrast with the fine stranded gel observed for the PRrp of SA2 (Figures 2 and 3).  \n\nIn Figure 8a the elastic and loss moduli of the SC1 system are shown as a function \n\nof frequency. The mechanical spectrum of the protein rich phase showed a gel-like \n\nstructure with G\u2019(?) greater than G\u2019\u2019(?) and slightly dependent on frequency. The mixed \n\nsolution and the polysaccharide rich phase exhibited diluted solution behaviour with an \n\nestimated cross-over point (at 1000 s-1) far away from the highest examined frequency. The \n\nflow behaviour of the SC1 system shown in Figure 8b was similar to the one of the SA1 \n\nsystem (Figure 6). The protein rich phase showed shear-thinning behaviour (Figure 8b) and \n\nexhibited slippage at low shear rates. The mixed solution and the polysaccharide rich phase \n\nshowed both zero shear viscosity of 0.2 Pa.s. \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 191\n\n  \n\nFigure 8.

Closed symbols correspond to G\u2019(?) and open symbols correspond to \n\nG\u201d(?) or ?. \n\nThe oscillatory and steady state rheological behaviour of the SC2 system are shown \n\nin Figure 9. The protein rich phase of SC2 was highly shear-thinning (Figure 9b). In \n\ncontrast to SC1, the zero shear viscosity of the mixed solution was greater than the one of \n\nPSrp, both exhibiting a first Newtonian plateau up to around 10 s\n-1. In addition, the SC2 \n\ninitial mixture showed a Newtonian viscosity 10-fold greater than that found for SC1 \n\nmixture. It is interesting to note that the flow characteristics of PRrp of SPI-polysaccharide \n\nsystems containing the same amount of biopolymers (SA1 and SC1 / SA2 and SC2) were \n\nvery similar. \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 192\n\nFigure 9.

Closed symbols correspond to G\u2019(?) and open symbols \n\ncorrespond to G\u201d(?) or ?. \n\nThe protein rich phase exhibited weak gel-like properties. The mixed solution and \n\nthe polysaccharide rich phase exhibited similar mechanical spectrum. A \u201cshoulder\u201d in the \n\nG\u2019(?) curves was observed indicating an increase in the elasticity at low frequencies. \n\nCapron et al. (2001) and Simeone et al. (2002) also observed a \u201cshoulder\u201d in the G\u2019(?) \n\ncurve, which was associated to a terminal relaxation time of the blend of viscoelastic \n\nliquids and attributed to the relaxation of shape of the droplets. The increase of the \n\nelasticity at lower frequencies was more pronounced for MS than for PSrp. In addition, this \n\nphenomenon was not observed in SC1 system. For the latter system, there were not any \n\nspherical protein aggregates for MS (Figure 10) and any protein inclusions could be \n\nobserved in PSrp micrograph. The above results indicated that the \u201cshoulder\u201d phenomenon \n\nwas related to the morphological characteristics and to the degree of interfacial tension of \n\nthe system, while its intensity was also influenced by the volume fraction.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 193\n\n3.2.3. SPI - gellan mixture \n\nThe biopolymer concentrations of the SG system were measured, plotted and put \n\ntogether with the corresponding micrographs (Figure 10). The protein and the \n\npolysaccharide concentrations of the SG system were respectively 4.8% and 0.39% for \n\nthe mixed solution, 7.6% and 0.25% for the protein rich phase and 4.3% and 0.48% for \n\nthe polysaccharide rich phase, with mass balances error lower than 10%.  \n\n \n\nFigure 10.

It was not possible to determine the \n\ndegree of phase separation from the micrographs of the rich phases, since it was not \n\nobserved any inclusions and the polysaccharide molecule was not stained. The \n\nhomogeneity of all micrographs could be attributed to the low interfacial tension between \n\nthe coexisting phases. In addition those coexisting phases were unstable, which means that \n\nthey could easily be remixed to form a homogeneous solution.  \n\nThe mechanical spectra (Figure 11a) of SG systems indicated that G\u2019\u2019 was greater \n\nthan the corresponding G\u2019 over all frequency range for all samples. The protein rich phase \n\nexhibited the lowest G\u2019 and G\u2019\u2019 values. The PSrp and MS samples showed a semi-diluted \n\nsolution behaviour as the G\u2019 and G\u201d cross-over point was estimated to be at a frequency \n\nnear 10 s-1.  \n\n  \n\nFigure 11.

The polysaccharide rich \n\nphase exhibited shear thinning behaviour with a first Newtonian plateau at viscosity of 0.8 \n\nPa.s until a shear rate close to 1 s-1. The slippage phenomenon was observed for the mixed \n\nsolution, making not possible to determine the first Newtonian plateau. The viscosity values \n\nof this flow curve were significantly lower than that of the polysaccharide rich phase up to \n\n50 s-1, but the curves fell on a single curve from this value. The protein rich phase exhibited \n\nNewtonian flow behaviour with a viscosity of 0.01 Pa.s. \n\n3.2.4. Na-caseinate - gellan mixture \n\nFigure 12 shows the tie-line and the corresponding micrographs of the CG system. \n\nThe tie-line data were obtained by measuring the protein and polysaccharide concentrations \n\nof the mixed solution (CPR = 5.0 %, CPS = 0.37 %), protein rich phase (CPR = 5.2 %, CPS = \n\n0.18 %) and polysaccharide rich phase (CPR = 3.0 %, CPS = 1.6 %). The mass balances for \n\nthe protein showed an error of 6%, while the polysaccharide exhibited an error of 20 %. \n\nThese values confirm the above discussion about the difficulties associated with the phase \n\ncollection for such system.  \n\nThe CLSM micrograph of the mixed solution exhibited regularly distributed \n\nfluorescence indicating that the proteins and polysaccharide were completely homogenized \n\n(Figure 12). The micrograph of the protein rich phase was similar to the one of the mixed \n\nsolution, and it was not possible to optically determine the degree of phase separation. The \n\nmicrograph of the polysaccharide rich phase exhibited a black background with spherical \n\nand ellipsoidal white aggregates of proteins with diameters up to 10 \u00b5m. The shape of those \n\ninclusions could be attributed to the high interfacial tension between the gelified \n\npolysaccharide phase and the liquid protein one. In addition, when dealing with a gelling \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 196\n\npolysaccharide, the structure of the inclusions is mainly determined by the gelling process \n\nrate. \n\n \n\nFigure 12.

The mixed solution \n\npresented properties of a concentrated solution with an estimated cross-over point between \n\nstorage (G\u2019) and loss modulus G\u201d at around 3 s-1.

The G\u2019 values of the PSrp was greater than G\u2019\u2019 indicating the gel-like \n\nbehaviour.  \n\n  \nFigure 13.

The PSrp system showed shear thinning character from \n\nthe very low shear rate. The mixed solution could also be characterized as shear thinning \n\nfluid but with a first Newtonian plateau up to 0.5 s-1 and a Newtonian viscosity of 0.6 Pa.s. \n\nAt high shear rates (>100 s-1) it could be observed a viscosity tendency to attain the second \n\nNewtonian plateau. The protein rich phase was Newtonian, being the viscosity value equal \n\nto 0.012 s-1.  \n\n3.2.5. Na-caseinate \u2013 Na-alginate mixture \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 198\n\nThe measured biopolymer concentrations of the CA system (Figure 14) were \n\nCPR = 2.9% and CPS = 2.3% in the mixed solution, CPR = 14.7% and CPS = 0.4% in the \n\nprotein rich phase and CPR = 0.3% and CPS = 2.7% in the polysaccharide rich phase, with \n\nmass balances error lower than 5%. The tie-line presented in Figure 14 is in quantitative \n\nagreement with previous results available in the literature (Simeone et al., 2004, Antonov et \n\nal., 2004). However, the work done by Capron et al. (2001) showed a greater protein \n\nconcentration in PSrp than the present work. Studies about phase separation of CA mixture \n\nare done with different centrifugation conditions, varying from 15000 x g / 3 h (Capron et \n\nal., 2001) up to 100000 x g / 15 h (Simeone et al., 2004). In the present work, it was used \n\nthe mild condition of 60000 x g / 1h, as that used by Antonov et al. (2004). Thus, the \n\ndifferences found in the phase composition could be attributed to incomplete phase \n\nseparation, since a centrifugation at 15000 x g / 3 h is equivalent of 60000 g / 30 min that is \n\nhalf of the time used in the present work. This is supported by the fact that Simeone et al. \n\n(2004) observed an incomplete phase separation for a high viscous CA mixture even at \n\n100000 x g / 15h. \n\nThe micrograph of the mixed solution (Figure 14) showed spherical protein \n\naggregates of different sizes with diameters up to 20 \u00b5m. The protein in the PRrp \n\nmicrograph was regularly distributed without black areas. In the polysaccharide rich phase \n\nno aggregated protein could be noticed as the micrograph showed a continuous black \n\ncolour without any white region. These micrographs indicated that complete phase \n\nseparation was reached during the process of centrifugation. High interfacial forces were \n\nassumed to cause the spherical shape of the protein aggregates in the mixed solution, since \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 199\n\nthe obtained tie-line was localized far from the critical point (Capron et al., 2001, Antonov \n\net al., 2004). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 14.

The mixed solution and the polysaccharide rich-phase exhibited diluted solution \n\nbehaviour with similar G\u201d(?) values. The storage modulus of the mixed solution formed a \n\nslight \u201cshoulder\u201d exhibiting increased G\u2019 values in the frequency range of 0.05-0.26 s-1. \n\nCapron et al. (2001) and Simeone et. al. (2002) also observed this kind of shoulder for CA \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 200\n\nmixtures. In both cases the Palierne equation (Palierne, 1990) was well fitted to the data. \n\nThis phenomenon indicated the existence of dispersed particles in a continuous phase and \n\nconfirmed the observations done for MS micrograph (Figure 14). The protein rich phase \n\nexhibited the greatest G\u2019 and G\u2019\u2019 values of the CA system, with a estimated cross-over \n\npoint close to 10 s-1, indicating the properties of a semi-diluted solution.  \n\nThe flow curves for all the samples of the CA system (Figure 15b) exhibited a \n\nNewtonian plateau at low shear rates, shear thinning behaviour at higher deformations and \n\nno slippage was noticed. The flow curve of the mixed solution (?0 = 2 Pa.s) was closed to \n\nthat of the polysaccharide rich phase (?0 = 1 Pa.s) and both Newtonian plateau ended at a \n\nshear rate of about 10 s-1.

Round and irregular shaped \n\nregions devoid of protein, with a wide range of size up to 35 \u00b5m, indicated inclusions of \n\npolysaccharide. The micrograph of the polysaccharide rich phase exhibited sprinkled \n\naggregates of protein smaller than 1.5 \u00b5m. A phase inversion was noticed between the \n\nprotein rich phase and the polysaccharide rich phase. In a phase diagram if one moves \n\nalong the tie-line, the composition of the two phases stay the same but their relative \n\nvolumes change according to the relative length of the tie-line to the binodal (Norton and \n\nFrith, 2001). The mixed solution exhibited irregular shaped protein aggregates in a \n\ncontinuous polysaccharide rich phase, being the highest inclusion size up to 35 \u00b5m. This \n\nsample looked like an emulsion during the coalescence step as can be seen some regions \n\nwith elongated structures made of attached droplets, which was interpreted as the initial \n\nstep of the phase inversion.  \n\nThe mechanical spectra of the CC system are shown in Figure 17. The protein rich \n\nphase behaved like a gel, being G\u2019 greater than G\u2019\u2019 over the entire frequency range (Figure \n\n17a). This result agrees with the observed CLSM micrographs (Figure 16) since the round \n\nshape of the polysaccharide inclusions could be attributed to the high interfacial tension \n\nbetween a liquid and a gel. The polysaccharide rich phase showed a semi-diluted solution \n\nbehaviour with estimated cross-over points between G\u2019 and G\u2019\u2019 near to the highest \n\nfrequency evaluated, 10 s-1 (Figure 17b). The mixed solution exhibited a \u201cshoulder\u201d in the \n\nstorage modulus curve at the low frequency region (Capron et al., 2001; Simeone et al., \n\n2002, Palierne, 1990). In addition, a second overlapping \u201cshoulder\u201d could be observed \n\nincreasing the frequency. From the MS micrograph (Figure 16) it can be supposed that the \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 203\n\nsecond \u201cshoulder\u201d is somehow associated to the coalescence process of the dispersed \n\nphase. \n\nAt high shear rate region MS, PRrp and PSrp samples exhibited similar viscosity, \n\nwhereas at low shear rate their flow behaviours were quite different (Figure 18). The \n\nviscosity value of PRrp was 44 Pa.s at low shear rate and decreased sharply as the shear rate \n\nwas increased, which is typical of a shear-thinning behaviour. The MS showed similar zero \n\nshear viscosity but a shorter Newtonian plateau than PSrp. However, the similar behaviour \n\nof MS and PSrp at large deformation was not observed in small deformation experiments \n\n(Figure 17). This suggests that the characteristics, such as shape and size, of the dispersed \n\nphase can not be quantified by large deformation rheological properties. \n\n  \n\nFigure 17.

Comparison of the characteristics of MS, PRrp and PSrp systems \n\nThe tie-lines of the studied systems are shown in Figure 19. The systems containing \n\nSPI exhibited tie-lines with greater slope than the systems containing Na-caseinate \n\nindependent on the investigated polysaccharide. The tie-line slope gives information about \n\nthe hidrophilicity of the used biopolymers and the solvent quality. A decrease of the tie-line \n\ndeclination indicates an increase of both the polysaccharide hydrophilicity and the protein \n\nhidrophobicity. Thus, the results shown in Figure 19 indicated that SPI was more \n\nhydrophobic than Na-caseinate. Grinberg and Tolstoguzov (1997) observed that the \n\nsoybean globulin was more hydrophobic than casein from the phase diagram asymmetry. \n\nThe higher hydrophobicity of SPI enhanced the association of the protein molecules during \n\nthe centrifugation of systems containing Na-alginate and ?-carrageenan, which resulted in \n\nthe gelation of the PRrp. \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 205\n\n \n\nFigure 22.

Continuous line is the tie-line for SPI \n\nsystems, dashed line is the tie-line for Na-caseinate systems. \n\nThe density difference for all kind of studied systems was calculated (Table 6) in \n\norder to have more information on the properties of phase behaviour. The density values \n\nwere calculated from the mixing rule (Equation 7) and the density relations as a function of \n\nconcentration for each biopolymer (Chapter 3 \u2013 1st part). \n\n?rp = ?PR ? ? + ?PS ? (1 ? ?)  (7) \n\nwhere ? (g/L) is the density ? is the protein mass fraction in the coexisting phase. The \n\nsubscripts PR, PS, rp correspond, respectively, to protein, polysaccharide and rich phase. \n\nThe tie-line slope (Figure 19) was inversely proportional to the density differences \n\n(??) of the coexisting phases (Table 6) for MS of CA, CC, SA2 and SC2. Antonov et al. \n\n(2004) investigated the relation between ?? and the interfacial tension for different tie-lines \n\nof CA systems. These authors observed a non-linear (power) dependency of interfacial \n\ntension on ?? with a power equal to 3.1. Therefore, the magnitude order of the interfacial \n\ntension was estimated using a power of 3 predicted by the mean-field theory (Rowlinson \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 206\n\nand Widon, 1984) and such values are shown in Table 6. The calculated ?? as well as the \n\nestimated order of the interfacial tension for CA system were in agreement with other \n\nworks (Simeone et al., 2004, Antonov et al., 2004, Capron et al., 2001, Guido et al., 2002), \n\nsuch that this method was extended to the other systems studied here. \n\nThe systems containing gellan exhibited very low ?? (up to 8 g/L) indicating an \n\nextremely low interfacial tension of the order 10-10 and 10-8 N/m. These interfacial tension \n\norders usually are found for systems located on the phase diagram closed to the critical \n\npoint (Antonov et al., 2004). Such results explain the difficulties associated to the \n\nwithdrawing of the phases and the homogeneous microstructure observed for PRrp and MS \n\nof CG and for PRrp, PSrp and MS of SG. The systems containing ?-carrageenan and alginate \n\nshowed higher interfacial tension than gellan samples with values orders up to 10-5 N/m. \n\nThe meaning of these data could be better understood by analyzing the density difference \n\nvalues. Comparing ?? values of those systems it was noticed three distinct groups, being \n\n?? of CC equal to 12.7 g/L, around 35 g/L for CA and SC, while the ?? of SA2 was 56.9 \n\ng/L. From all these systems, CA was the only one that formed two liquid rich-phases. In \n\nspite of that, the rich phases of CA exhibited a high ?? value comparable to the values of \n\nSC, which formed a visual strong gel protein rich phase and a liquid polysaccharide rich \n\nphase explaining its high interfacial tension. These particular properties of the CA systems \n\nmade the phase separation and withdrawing less difficult, which probably led to a great \n\nnumber of works to use such system as a model. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 207\n\nTable 6.

Few works in the literature showed that \n\nthe mixture viscosity affects the degree of phase separation (Clark, 2000, Simeone et al., \n\n2004, Cavallieri, 2003). Thus, the time and/or velocity of centrifugation should be adapted \n\nconsidering the mixture viscosity, in order to obtain a complete phase separation. \n\nMoreover, the centrifugation conditions shown in the literature are completely different for \n\nthe same system (Section 3.2.5), indicating that there is not unanimity on that task. \n\nFigure 20 shows the storage modulus (G\u2019) at 0.1 Hz, the zero shear viscosity for \n\nPRrp of CA, SA2, SC2 and CC as well as the maximum area of each single inclusion (Ai) \n\nobserved in micrographs. The G\u2019 and Ai values increased according to the following order \n\nof the systems CA<SA2<SC2<CC. The storage modulus reflects the elasticity of the sample \n\nand the higher values found for SA2, SC2 and CC were related to the formation of a protein \n\nnetwork. When comparing the gelling systems, the differences of G\u2019 values could be \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 208\n\nascribed to the amount of polysaccharide present in the inclusions as observed by Ai values. \n\nThus, the storage modulus value of PRrp can be used as an indicator of the degree of phase \n\ncontamination. Figure 20 shows that ?0 and G\u2019 values of the SA2-PRrp were similar to those \n\nobtained for the SC2-PRrp. However, the area of the inclusions increased for SC2 and the \n\npolysaccharide mass fraction was 2.5 fold greater indicating that the repulsive forces in this \n\nsituation were smaller than for SA2. \n\n \nFigure 20. Rheological and morphological properties for the PRrp of different systems. \n\nThe alginate was easily separated from Na-caseinate resulting in two liquid phases \n\nexhibiting low G\u2019 at 0.1 Hz and any inclusions (Ai = 0 \u00b5m2). This was in accordance with \n\nthe high non-gelling character of Na-caseinate in a pure system. In contrast, the PRrp of CC \n\nwas a gel even with a lower protein concentration than the one found for CA-PRrp (Figure \n\n19). This fact indicated that the carrageenan contributed to the formation of the protein gel \n\n(Figure 17) by protein-polysaccharide and polysaccharide-polysaccharide interactions \n\n(Spagnuolo et al., 2005). The zero shear viscosity of PRrp of CC was quite the same to the \n\none found for CA. This indicates that the protein network of CC-PRrp was the most elastic \n\nbut exhibited a great capacity of rearrange due to the low viscosity. Those results suggested \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 1st part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 209\n\nthat ?-carrageenan was more compatible with both soy protein and Na-caseinate than Na-\n\nalginate. \n\n4. Conclusion \n\nThe results showed that SPI was more hydrophobic than the Na-caseinate, which \n\ninduced the gelation of the protein rich phase of systems containing Na-alginate and ?-\n\ncarrageenan. However, SPI-gellan sytems did not resut in gelified rich-phases, suggesting \n\nthat gellan could be used as a thickner agent in soy products. In the presence of Na-alginate \n\nthe SPI showed lower amount of polysaccharide inclusions as compared to the mixture of \n\nSPI with ?-carrageenan. ?-Carrageenan contributed to the formation of a gelified protein \n\nrich-phase by interaction with Na-caseinate. In the other hand, this polysaccharide was \n\neasily separated from Na-caseinate. The results indicated that ?-carrageenan was more \n\ncompatible with SPI and Na-caseinate than Na-alginate.  \n\nThe confocal micrographs revealed different degree of separation for a fixed \n\ncentrifugation condition (60000 g during 1 h). Thus, the type of biopolymer and its \n\nconcentration affected the degree of phase separation, which was attributed to the delaying \n\neffect of the viscosity on the separation process. Therefore, the time and/or velocity of \n\ncentrifugation should be adapted considering the mixture viscosity in order to obtain a \n\ncomplete phase separation. The rheological behaviour of the systems varied from a diluted \n\nsolution to a gel. An increase of system elasticity was observed for systems that showed \n\nround shape inclusions, which is typical of water-in-water emulsions. \n\n \n\n5.

Introduction \n\nAqueous mixtures of proteins and polysaccharides are commonly found in food \n\nproducts. However, these two kinds of biopolymers are usually incompatible showing \n\nsegregative phase separation at pH 7.0. Sometimes microscopically phase separation can \n\narise with interesting morphology, which can vary from elongated to droplet-like structures. \n\nIn that kind of systems, each phase is highly enriched with one of the two biopolymers. \n\nWhen droplet-like morphology is formed the system can be regarded as emulsion of the \n\nwater-in-water type (Tolstoguzov, 1986). The presence of biphasic morphology is essential \n\nfor the mixture be able to mimic the properties of fat in food products (Capron et al., 2001). \n\nIn addition, some studies have been carried out on the gelation of the dispersed phase (Wolf \n\net al., 2000; Lundell et al., 2004) in order to produce new attractive textures. \n\nThe rheological behaviour of aqueous biopolymer mixtures is quite different from \n\nthat of a pure biopolymer solution due to the hydrodynamic influence of the dispersed \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 216\n\nphase (Simeone et al., 2002). The interfacial tension is considered as the most important \n\nproperty to maintain an emulsion-type structure (Van Puyvelde et al., 2002). However, an \n\ninteresting feature of these systems is the extremely low interfacial tension that is around \n\n0.1-100 \u00b5N/m. This fact adds a greater complexity when dealing with such systems.  \n\nNowadays, big effort has been paid to elucidate the interfacial tension of biphasic \n\nsystems as well as their behaviour under shear. For that purpose the technique of drop \n\nshape analysis (Guido et al., 2002) or rheo-optical methods (Mewis et al. 1998 and Van \n\nPuyvelde et al., 1998) based on small angle light scattering (SALS) patterns have been \n\nused. The most studied systems in the last years have been sodium alginate - sodium \n\ncaseinate (Capron et al., 2001; Guido et al., 2002; Antonov et al., 2004), ?-carrageenan \u2013 \n\ngellan (Wolf et al., 2000), gelatin \u2013 dextran (Ding et al., 2002; Scholten et al., 2002), \n\ngelatin \u2013 arabic gum (Scholten et al., 2004) and gelatin \u2013 maltodextrin (Lundell et al., \n\n2004). However, the morphology of some important aqueous mixtures for the food industry \n\nhas not been studied yet, such as mixtures containing xanthan, galactomannans and soy \n\nproteins. \n\nThe objectives of this work were 1) to characterize morphologically at rest and \n\nunder shear different mixtures of proteins and polysaccharides prepared after phase \n\nseparation in order to discuss the formation of water-in-water emulsions, 2) to demonstrate \n\nthat complementary techniques like CLSM and rheo-SALS should be used together to get \n\ncomplete information about the morphology of these systems. The morphology at rest was \n\nobserved by confocal microscopy. Such measurements were supplemented with qualitative \n\nobservations of SALS patterns under shear. The polysaccharides investigated were xanthan, \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 217\n\nlocust bean gum, gellan, ?-carrageenan and sodium alginate, while sodium caseinate and \n\nsoy protein isolate (SPI) were used as protein source.  \n\n2. Material and methods \n\n2.1. Material \n\nThe proteins used to prepare the model systems were casein (Sigma Chemical Co., \n\nUSA) and soy protein isolate (SPI) obtained from defatted soy flour (Bunge Alimentos \n\nS.A., Brazil). The polysaccharides used were sodium (Na)-alginate, ?-carrageenan and \n\ngellan, all of them obtained from CP Kelco (USA). Table 1 shows the chemical \n\ncharacterization of each biopolymer. The moisture and ash contents were determined using \n\nthe gravimetric method, in which the initial and final samples were weighed. The ash was \n\nobtained by heating the powder at 550oC until it becomes a carbon-free sample (AOAC, \n\n1996). For moisture analysis the powder was dried in a vacuum-oven at 60 oC until the \n\nsample weight reached a constant value.

The soy protein isolate (SPI) solution (milli-Q \n\nwater) was prepared at room temperature by magnetic stirring until the complete powder \n\nhydration and the pH was adjusted to 7.0 with 1M HCl. The polysaccharide solutions were \n\nprepared by first dispersing the powders in milli-Q water at room temperature by magnetic \n\nstirring and after heating in a water bath with a fixed temperature and time (Table 2). The \n\nprepared solutions were immediately cooled down to room temperature in an ice bath, and \n\nnone of them gelified after this process. The insoluble particles of proteins and Na-alginate \n\nsolutions were separated by centrifugation in a Sigma centrifuge 3K30 (rotor no 33310 \u2013 \n\nSigma Laborzentrifugen GmbH, Germany) at 60,000 x g for 60 minutes at 25\u00b0C (Antonov \n\net al., 2004).

These solutions were poured into polycarbonate tubes of \n\n25 mL that were centrifuged in a Sigma centrifuge 3K30 (rotor no 33310 \u2013 Sigma \n\nLaborzentrifugen GmbH, Germany) at 60,000 x g for 1 h at 25\u00b0C (Antonov et al., 2004). \n\nThe phases were then carefully withdrawn. An aliquote of 0.1 g of the protein-rich phase \n\n(PRrp) and of 9.9 g of the polysaccharide-rich phase (PSrp) were mixed to obtain a second \n\nmixture (MS2), which was analysed by confocal microscopy and rheo-SALS.  \n\nTable 3 shows the composition (protein and polysaccharide concentrations) of the \n\ninitial mixture (MS1) and the protein and polysaccharide rich-phases obtained after phase \n\nseparation for different protein-polysaccharide systems.

Rheo-Small Angle Light Scattering (rheo-SALS) \n\nLight scattering measurements under shear were performed using a home built \n\nSALS set up designed for the stress controlled Rheometrics\u00ae DSR rheometer (USA). Creep \n\ntests in the stress range of 0.1-1000 Pa were performed during 30 s. The steady state laser \n\nscattering profile and apparent viscosity were obtained. Apparent viscosity versus shear rate \n\ndata were ploted and the Cross model (Equation 1) was used to fit those data.  \n\n???\n??\n\n?k+\n=\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n (1) \n\nwhere ? is the apparent viscosity and the subscripts 0 and ?, respectively, indicate the zero \n\nshear viscosity and the infinite Newtonian viscosity.

A 5 mW He-Ne laser (Melles Griot) provided a monochromatic light of \n\nwavelength 632.8 nm. Using three prisms the laser beam was deflected and sent through the \n\nsample placed between transparent quartz parallel plates (gap = 0.5 mm). The light \n\npropagated through the velocity gradient direction thus probing the structure in the plane of \n\nflow and vorticity (Figure 2). The scattered light at small angles was intercepted on a screen \n\nunder the sample that consists of a semi-transparent plastic. The scattering images were \n\ncaptured using a Sony CCD camera (DFW-V 500, Japan), which was mounted under the \n\nscreen. Regarding the camera position, it was necessary to add a main beam stop in the \n\nplastic screen, such that the camera could record only the scattered light. \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 222\n\n  \nFigure 2.

Confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) \n\nThe protein-polysaccharide mixtures (MS2) (Table 3) were observed under confocal \n\nlaser scanning microscope (CSLM). Rhodamine B was added and mixed carefully with \n\nabout 1 mL of sample. Such a fluorescent dye was used in order to stain the protein. The \n\nsamples were placed in indentations of microscope slides, covered with a glass cover slip \n\nand sealed with nail polish to prevent evaporation. A dual-channel laser confocal system \n\n(MRC 1024 UV, Biorad, USA) mounted on an Axiovert 100 Zeiss inverted microscope and \n\nequipped with Ar-Kr lasers was used for the trials. The Ar-Kr lasers emitted polarized light \n\nwith a wavelength of 568 nm exciting the Rhodamine-labeled proteins. Images were taken \n\nusing a 100x oil immersion objective. To obtain a representative structure 15 micrographs \n\nof each sample were taken. \n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 223\n\n \n\n3. Results and discussion \n\nSome authors mentioned the existence of a water-in-water emulsion at biopolymer \n\nconcentrations near the binodal curve. This emulsion could be obtained by mixing two \n\ncomplete separated phases in a PRrp/PSrp ratio of 1/99 or vice-versa. In the present work, \n\nthis ratio was kept to form the MS2 systems (Figure 1), although the equilibrium of the \n\nphases was not reached for all systems (Chapter 5 - 1st part). Table 4 shows the visual \n\ncharacterization of the protein and polysaccharide rich-phases. Almost all systems showed \n\none of the phases gelified, except for CA and SG where two liquid phases were observed. \n\nThus, when preparing the liquid MS2 samples the systems were stirred until any visible gel \n\nparticle could be observed by eye. \n\nTable 4.

The CA-MS2 mixture at rest showed spherical protein aggregates (white \n\nregions in the micrograph) with diameters up to 5 \u00b5m indicating a microstructure typical of \n\nwater-in-water emulsion (Capron et al., 2001). The SALS pattern was isotropic at rest and \n\nlow shear rates for CA system, but it showed a strong anisotropy perpendicular to the flow \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 224\n\ndirection increasing shear rate, which reflects the deformation of the droplets. At higher \n\nshear rates, the anisotropy gradually relaxes (440 s-1) and finally, an isotropic pattern was \n\nagain obtained (6300 s-1). It has been demonstrated (Van Puyvelde et al., 2003) that while \n\nthe droplets are continuously stretched, their cross-section becomes smaller and \n\nconsequently the interfacial stress increases. As a result, interfacial instabilities will start to \n\ndevelop and will eventually disintegrate the droplets. During this process, the anisotropy of \n\nthe structure decreases, as seen in Figure 3. Thus, this evolution from anisotropy, relaxation \n\nand steady-state elliptic pattern could be explained on the basis of deformation, breakup, \n\nand coalescence of the dispersed droplets. Hence, under these conditions, the biopolymer \n\nemulsion behaves according to the theoretical relations for conventional emulsions and \n\nsimilar to synthetic blends (Van Puyvelde et al., 2003). \n\n \n\n  \nFigure 3.

The CLSM results \n\n(Figure 4a) exhibited square-edged irregular protein aggregates measuring up to 8 \u00b5m in \n\nhighest size. The shapes of the aggregates suggest that the dispersion was a gel.  \n\n  \n \n\n \nFigure 4. CLSM microstructural (a) and rheo-optical (b, c) characterization of the MS2 \nsystem (1% PRrp + 99% PSrp) containing 1.4% SPI and 2.6% Na-alginate (a, b) and of SA2-\nPSrp system with 1.2% protein plus 2.6% polysaccharide (c). The light regions in the \nCLSM micrograph (a) indicate protein area, scale bar = 50\u00b5m. The lines in rheological \ngraphs (b, c) represent the fit of Cross equation to the data. \n\nThis system behaved as a shear-thinning fluid (Figure 4b). From the inserts Figure4, \n\nit can be observed that the light was scattered in high angles in a great intensity. In addition, \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 226\n\nthe scattering profile was isotropic at low shear rates showing that the dispersed gels were \n\nhomogeneously distributed in the continuous phase. In contrast to CA system, it was not \n\nobserved an anisotropic evolution perpendicular to the flow direction. Instead, a slight \n\nanisotropy in the flow direction was checked in the beginning of the non-Newtonian region. \n\nAs discussed in chapter 5 \u2013 1st part the phase separation of SA was not complete. \n\nThe CLSM microstructure of its PSrp looked like a water-in-water emulsion, with droplets \n\ndispersed in a continuous phase (Figure 3). Hence, the SALS pattern under shear of this \n\nsystem (PSrp-SA containing 1.2% protein and 2.6% polysaccharide) was evaluated in order \n\nto compare the properties of two emulsions containing one protein (SPI or Na-caseinate) \n\nand Na-alginate. In addition, the amount of Na-alginate in both systems was quite the same \n\n(2.6-2.7%). The SALS pattern of PSrp-SA (Figure 4c) was isotropic at rest, as expected \n\nfrom the homogeneous distributed dispersed phase. Once more, it was observed an \n\nanisotropic structure in the flow direction at the beginning of the non-Newtonian region. \n\nOnly at high shear rates (3500 s-1) a slight deformation perpendicular to the flow direction \n\nwas developed, even though the CLSM micrographs showed a water-in-water emulsion. \n\nThese results corroborate with the above suggestion that the dispersed protein droplets were \n\nindeed gels, such that it was difficult to deform the droplets under shear. \n\nThe SC system showed a shear-thinning behaviour and the shape of the inclusions \n\nvaried from droplet-like to irregular square-edged. Those inclusions measured up to 6 \u00b5m \n\nin highest size. The anisotropic SALS pattern (Figure 5b) perpendicular to the flow \n\ndirection was developed only at very high shear rates, 4000s-1. In addition, it was observed \n\na slight anisotropy shape in the flow direction at the beginning of the non-newtonian region \n\n(data not shown), as previously mentioned for SA system. The micrograph of the CC \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 227\n\nsystem exhibited small inclusions of protein with sizes up to 3 \u00b5m (Figure 6a). Figure 6b \n\nshows that this system behaved as shear-thinning fluid and showed an isotropic SALS \n\npattern at low and very high shear rates. However, for intermediate shear rates it was not \n\nobserved a similar pattern of CA, as expected due to the formation of an emulsion at rest. \n\nInstead, an anisotropic pattern in the flow direction was observed in the shear thinning \n\nregion.  \n\n  \nFigure 5.

The light regions in the CLSM micrograph (a) indicate protein area, scale bar = \n50\u00b5m. \n\nIn contrast to the other examined systems, the CG sample formed a gelified PSrp and \n\na liquid PRrp. The confocal microstructure (Figure 7a) of MS2-CG system showed big and \n\nround protein inclusions with diameters up to 30 \u00b5m. However, it was not possible to \n\nperform the rheo-SALS experiments of such system due to its fragile characteristic with a \n\ngreat release of water during shearing. Thus, a system containing 1% PSrp and 99% PRrp (in \n\nthe other end of the tie-line) was investigated, since some works reported the formation of \n\nan emulsion with a protein continuous phase (Antonov et al., 2004, Schorsch et al., 1999). \n\nThe CLSM microstructure of such system is shown in Figure 7b and it was not observed \n\nthe formation of an emulsion. Instead, the proteins were homogeneously distributed, which \n\nresulted in absence of scattered light in rheo-optics experiments (Figure 7c) over the entire \n\nshear rate range. This indicates that the sample was homogenized on the length scales \n\nprobed by light scattering. The same trend was observed for MS2-SG system (Figure 7d). \n\nThose behaviours could be explained by the low interfacial forces acting in such systems \n\n(Chapter 5 \u2013 1st part). This indicates that soy proteins can not be gelled using gellan, in \n\ncontrast to what happened with Na-alginate and ?-carrageenan. Hence, gellan would be \n\nused as a good thickener for soy products. \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 229\n\n  \n \n\n  \nFigure 7.

The light regions in the CLSM micrographs (a, b, d) indicate protein area, \nscale bar = 50\u00b5m. The line in rheological graph (c) represents the fit of Cross equation to \nthe data. \n\nThe above results revealed that systems containing SPI and Na-alginate or ?-\n\ncarrgeenan resulted in gelified dispersed phase, since they could only be deformed at very \n\nhigh shear rates. However, the CLSM micrograph of PSrp-SA showed droplet-like \n\ninclusions as observed for CA system. These indicate that CLSM and rheo-SALS \n\ntechniques should be used complementary to each other to completely explain the \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 230\n\nmorphology of protein-polysaccharide systems. In addition, the systems with a gelified \n\ndispersed phase (SA, SC and CC) showed an unexpected anisotropy in the flow direction at \n\nthe beginning of the non-Newtonian region. The increase of the anisotropic pattern follows \n\nthe order: MS2-SA &lt;PSrp-SA &lt;MS2-CC; suggesting that the amount of droplets in the \n\nsystem is related with the development of such anisotropic behaviour. It is also interesting \n\nto note that mixtures containing SPI - Na-alginate and SPI - ?-carrageenan (Figures 4 and \n\n5) scattered the light in higher angles as compared to the systems containing Na-caseinate \n\n(Figures 3 and 6). \n\nThe mixing of the protein- and the polysaccharide-rich phase in a ratio of 1/99 \n\nformed a mixture lying on the tie-lines near to the polysaccharide rich phase. Comparing \n\nthe MS2 micrographs of CA and CC with the corresponding micrographs of the \n\npolysaccharide rich phases (Chapter 5 \u2013 1st part) an increase of the protein volume fraction \n\nwas observed for MS2. The microstructure of PSrp of CA (Chapter 5 \u2013 1\nst part) did not have \n\nany droplets, while MS2-CA showed a great amount of relatively big droplets. In the other \n\nhand, the morphology of PSrp-CC (Chapter 5 \u2013 1\nst part) showed small droplets inclusions, \n\nwhile MS2-CC had a similar microstructure but the droplets have slightly higher diameter \n\n(Figure 6). Those results indicated that the CA system showed a greater capacity to form \n\nemulsions than CC system. It is interesting to note that SG system would never form \n\nemulsion as well as the CG systems with protein continuous phase. These suggest that the \n\nPSrp/PRrp ratio of 1/99 or vice-versa can not be used as a general criterion for emulsion \n\nformation. \n\nThe differences in the dispersed phase, gel or liquid-like, droplet or square shape as \n\nwell the capacity of a system to form emulsions did not changed significantly the relaxation \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 231\n\ntime (k) or the flow behaviour index (n) of the system. The latter parameters were obtained \n\nby fitting the Cross model (R2>0.999) to the data and a value between 0.01-0.03 s was \n\nfound for k, while n was ~0.7 for all systems. These results indicate that the rheological \n\nbehaviour under large deformations did not give information about the emulsions structure, \n\nas occurred by analyzing the small deformation behaviour (Capron et al., 2001, Palierne, \n\n1990). \n\n \n \n\n \n\n4. Conclusion \n\nThe MS2 systems could be divided into three groups, namely, 1) water-in-water \n\nemulsions; 2) gelified dispersed phase in a continuous liquid phase or vice-versa; 3) \n\nhomogenous protein-polysaccharide solution. Regarding the type 1 systems, the Na-\n\ncaseinate \u2013 Na-alginate mixture showed a greater capacity to form emulsions than Na-\n\ncaseinate - carrageenan system, although both systems could be used in dairy products as \n\nfat replacers. Among the systems with gelified dispersed phase, the PSrp-SA could also be \n\nconsidered a water-in-water emulsion. However, the typical emulsion SALS pattern was \n\nobserved only for CA sample. The delays in the anisotropic development in the \n\nperpendicular flow direction as well as the appearance of an anisotropic pattern in the flow \n\ndirection were attributed to the presence of a gelified dispersed phase. Therefore, the \n\nCLSM and SALS techniques should be used complementary to each other to completely \n\nexplain the morphology of protein-polysaccharide systems. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5\u2013 2nd part \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n 232\n\n5.

No presente estudo observou-se \n\nque dentro do intervalo de concentra\u00e7\u00f5es estudado (1-12%), que \u00e9 o comumente utilizado \n\nem produtos aliment\u00edcios, solu\u00e7\u00f5es de prote\u00edna seguem um comportamento Newtoniano, \n\nenquanto que os polissacar\u00eddeos apresentam comportamento Newtoniano \u00e0 baixa \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o e pseudopl\u00e1stico com o aumento desta. Os valores de viscosidade aparente e \n\ndensidade das solu\u00e7\u00f5es puras foram fun\u00e7\u00e3o do tipo de biopol\u00edmero (polissacar\u00eddeo ou \n\nprote\u00edna) e da fonte de obten\u00e7\u00e3o dos polissacar\u00eddeos. O aumento da viscosidade aparente e \n\nredu\u00e7\u00e3o da densidade seguiu a seguinte ordem para uma dada concentra\u00e7\u00e3o e taxa de \n\ndeforma\u00e7\u00e3o: 1) prote\u00ednas, 2) polissacar\u00eddeos de origem microbiana (xantana e gelana), 3) \n\npolissacar\u00eddeo extra\u00eddo de plantas (jata\u00ed ou LBG) e 4) polissacar\u00eddeos obtidos a partir de \n\nalgas (Na-alginato e ?-carragena). Os maiores valores de densidade foram explicados por \n\numa maior capacidade de estrutura\u00e7\u00e3o dos polissacar\u00eddeos obtidos de algas e plantas em \n\nsolu\u00e7\u00e3o, nas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es estudadas, o que resultou em maior reten\u00e7\u00e3o de solvente em um \n\nmenor volume.  \n\nNo estudo do comportamento reol\u00f3gico de solu\u00e7\u00f5es de xantana tratadas \n\nt\u00e9rmicamente e adicionadas de sacarose, foram observadas tr\u00eas transi\u00e7\u00f5es da solu\u00e7\u00e3o, \n\ndependentes da temperatura e concentra\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema. Estas foram associadas \u00e0s regi\u00f5es \n\ncom anisotropia e/ou isotropia e \u00e0 mudan\u00e7a da conforma\u00e7\u00e3o molecular de um estado \n\nordenado (h\u00e9lice) para um desordenado. O aumento da temperatura de tratamento t\u00e9rmico e \n\na adi\u00e7\u00e3o de sacarose reduziram a elasticidade da solu\u00e7\u00e3o de xantana, sendo que a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nsacarose afetou as propriedades reol\u00f3gicas apenas de solu\u00e7\u00f5es anisotr\u00f3picas ou bif\u00e1sicas \n\n(mistas). Assim, foi sugerido que solu\u00e7\u00f5es contendo sacarose s\u00e3o menos interconectadas do \n\n\n\nCap\u00edtulo 6 \n \n\n 238\n\nque solu\u00e7\u00f5es puras de xantana provavelmente devido aos efeitos cosmotr\u00f3picos deste co-\n\nsoluto. Quando KCl foi adicionado \u00e0s solu\u00e7\u00f5es deste polissacar\u00eddeo, observou-se um \n\naumento da elasticidade do sistema. Assim, as propriedades f\u00edsicas das solu\u00e7\u00f5es puras de \n\nbiopol\u00edmeros pareceram ser altamente dependentes da presen\u00e7a de um co-soluto e do \n\nprocessamento t\u00e9rmico, sendo relacionadas \u00e0 conforma\u00e7\u00e3o molecular apresentada em \n\nsolu\u00e7\u00e3o, como forma\u00e7\u00e3o de duplas h\u00e9lices, de ultra-agregados e desordenamento molecular. \n\nDe forma geral, os tr\u00eas tipos de intera\u00e7\u00f5es entre prote\u00ednas e polissacar\u00eddeos, \n\nmiscibilidade, incompatibilidade ou coacerva\u00e7\u00e3o complexa, foram observados nos g\u00e9is e \n\nem solu\u00e7\u00f5es mistas considerando os biopol\u00edmeros estudados. As misturas contendo LBG e \n\numa prote\u00edna foram misc\u00edveis, visto que n\u00e3o separaram de fases ap\u00f3s centrifuga\u00e7\u00e3o a 60000 \n\nx g durante 1h, o que caracteriza uma grande compatibilidade deste polissacar\u00eddeo com \n\nambas prote\u00ednas avaliadas. O comportamento de misturas com goma xantana foi \n\ndependente do tipo de prote\u00edna adicionada, sendo observada miscibilidade na presen\u00e7a de \n\nNa-caseinato e de incompatibilidade em concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de SPI maiores do que 5%. As \n\ndemais solu\u00e7\u00f5es mistas apresentaram incompatibilidade entre a prote\u00edna e o polissacar\u00eddeo \n\nnas condi\u00e7\u00f5es de temperatura, for\u00e7a i\u00f4nica, pH e concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de ingredientes estudadas.  \n\nAs solu\u00e7\u00f5es aquosas incompat\u00edveis foram caracterizadas por rheo-SALS (\u201crheo-\n\nsmall angle light scattering\u201d) e CLSM (microscopia confocal de varredura laser) a fim de \n\nentender o papel de diferentes biopol\u00edmeros sobre o comportamento das fases e sobre a \n\nforma\u00e7\u00e3o de emuls\u00e3o tipo \u00e1gua-\u00e1gua sendo observado que estas duas t\u00e9cnicas devem ser \n\nutilizadas conjuntamente a fim de obter-se uma completa descri\u00e7\u00e3o morfol\u00f3gica de tais \n\nsistemas. A alta hidrofobicidade das prote\u00ednas da soja intensificou as associa\u00e7\u00f5es entre as \n\nmol\u00e9culas de prote\u00edna durante a centrifuga\u00e7\u00e3o resultando na gelifica\u00e7\u00e3o da fase prot\u00e9ica em \n\nmisturas com ?-carragena e Na-alginato. No entanto, isto n\u00e3o foi observado para sistemas \n\n\n\nCap\u00edtulo 6 \n \n\n 239\n\ncontendo gelana ou xantana, sendo que as fases ricas em cada biopol\u00edmero eram facilmente \n\nremisturadas provavelmente devido a uma baixa tens\u00e3o interfacial do sistema. Assim, estes \n\ndois polissacar\u00eddeos seriam mais indicados para serem utilizados em produtos l\u00edquidos \u00e0 \n\nbase de soja, enquanto a ?-carragena e o Na-alginato seriam interessantes em produtos onde \n\na agrega\u00e7\u00e3o prot\u00e9ica fosse desejada ou n\u00e3o interferisse na aceitabilidade do produto. \n\nComparando-se os dois polissacar\u00eddeos de origem de algas, observou-se que a ?-carragena \n\napresentou maior compatibilidade com o Na-caseinato e com SPI do que o Na-alginato. \u00c9 \n\ninteressante notar que a carragena j\u00e1 vem sendo utilizada acertadamente pela a ind\u00fastria de \n\nalimentos em sorvetes a base de soja, e em uma grande variedade de produtos l\u00e1cteos, \n\napesar do seu uso ter sido ditado pela experi\u00eancia pr\u00e1tica da carragena em produtos l\u00e1cteos. \n\nNo entanto, os resultados mostraram que misturas de Na-caseinato e Na-alginato \n\napresentaram melhor capacidade de formar emuls\u00f5es do tipo \u00e1gua-\u00e1gua quando comparada \n\ncom todos os sistemas estudados, o que \u00e9 interessante industrialmente pela possibilidade de \n\nsubstitui\u00e7\u00e3o das gotas de gordura por gotas de solu\u00e7\u00f5es de biopol\u00edmeros (fase dispersa). O \n\nsistema SPI - Na-alginato e Na-caseinato \u2013 ?-carragena tamb\u00e9m formaram emuls\u00f5es, mas \n\ncom a fase dispersa de prote\u00edna gelificada. Este \u00faltimo resultado \u00e9 bastante interessante do \n\nponto de vista de desenvolvimento de novos produtos com texturas diferentes. Em especial, \n\npoderia ser aplicado na fabrica\u00e7\u00e3o de chocolates com teor de gordura reduzido, visto que a \n\nfase dispersa de Na-caseinato apresentou a particularidade de ser um gel \u00e0 temperatura \n\nambiente e liquefazer-se com um pequeno aumento da temperatura, o que ocorreria durante \n\na degusta\u00e7\u00e3o do produto. \n\nNos sistemas gelificados n\u00e3o foi observada a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de g\u00e9is \u00e1cidos \n\nincompat\u00edveis. Estudos pr\u00e9vios mostraram que sistemas-modelo contendo Na-caseinato e \n\n\n\nCap\u00edtulo 6 \n \n\n 240\n\nxantana apresentaram coacerva\u00e7\u00e3o complexa, mesmo quando adicionados de um co-soluto, \n\ncomo a sacarose. Assim, a xantana n\u00e3o pareceu ser um polissacar\u00eddeo muito indicado na \n\nformula\u00e7\u00e3o de iogurtes. No entanto, g\u00e9is formados por xantana e SPI apresentaram uma \n\n\u00fanica fase e n\u00e3o foi observada sinerese, o que classifica estes g\u00e9is como misc\u00edveis sendo \n\nestes biopol\u00edmeros compat\u00edveis em pH \u00e1cido. Mesmo a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de um sal, KCl, n\u00e3o alterou \n\neste comportamento, apesar de ter influenciado todas as propriedades dos g\u00e9is mistos \n\ndevido aos efeitos de salting-in e salting-out da prote\u00edna. O uso de microscopia confocal, no \n\n\u00faltimo tipo de sistema, permitiu classificar os g\u00e9is mistos sem sal como de estrutura \n\norganizada enquanto que os g\u00e9is com sal apresentaram uma estrutura particulada aleat\u00f3ria. \n\nOs g\u00e9is t\u00e9rmicos de SPI-xantana foram estabilizados por intera\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o-covalentes \n\n(hidrof\u00f3bicas e ponte de H) e pontes S-S, enquanto que g\u00e9is adicionados de KCl foram \n\ntamb\u00e9m estabilizados por intera\u00e7\u00f5es eletrost\u00e1ticas.  \n\nA adi\u00e7\u00e3o de xantana enfraqueceu os g\u00e9is t\u00e9rmicos de SPI, provavelmente devido a \n\nliga\u00e7\u00e3o deste polissacar\u00eddeo com a sub-unidade ?-7S da SPI. Por outro lado, a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nxantana aumentou a tens\u00e3o e a deforma\u00e7\u00e3o de ruptura em g\u00e9is de SPI acidificados \n\nlentamente pela a\u00e7\u00e3o do GDL. De uma forma geral, em g\u00e9is formados com GDL, a redu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nda tens\u00e3o e deforma\u00e7\u00e3o de ruptura foi obtida pela diminui\u00e7\u00e3o da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de prote\u00edna \n\nem g\u00e9is puros de SPI e Na-caseinato ou pelo aumento do conte\u00fado de prote\u00edna em g\u00e9is \n\ncontendo xantana. Neste \u00faltimo caso, foi verificada a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de uma estrutura esponjosa \n\ncom o aumento do conte\u00fado de prote\u00edna. Al\u00e9m disto, a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de xantana resultou em \n\ngrande aumento da capacidade de reten\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua de g\u00e9is de SPI independente do \n\nprocesso de forma\u00e7\u00e3o da rede prot\u00e9ica, por tratamento t\u00e9rmico e por a\u00e7\u00e3o de GDL. Assim, \n\no uso de xantana em produtos \u00e0 base de soja seria indicado por exemplo para aumentar a \n\n\n\nCap\u00edtulo 6 \n \n\n 241\n\nreten\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua em GDL-tofu, o que \u00e9 de grande valia econ\u00f4mica para os produtores deste \n\nqueijo. Outra interessante aplica\u00e7\u00e3o desta goma seria para a manuten\u00e7\u00e3o da rede prot\u00e9ica \n\nem produtos aerados contendo mais de 6% de prote\u00edna. No entanto, a xantana n\u00e3o melhora \n\nas propriedades de produtos com alta quantidade de sal (em torno de 2%). \n\nA taxa de acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o (varia\u00e7\u00e3o na quantidade de GDL) n\u00e3o afetou as propriedades \n\nreol\u00f3gicas em cisalhamento de g\u00e9is puros de Na-caseinato, mas teve um efeito significativo \n\nsobre as propriedades em compress\u00e3o. A acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o lenta promoveu uma rede prot\u00e9ica \n\nmais interconectada e, portanto, mais forte. A velocidade de acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m afetou as \n\npropriedades reol\u00f3gicas de g\u00e9is de SPI e SPI-xantana, sendo obtidos g\u00e9is mais duros e \n\nel\u00e1sticos quando a acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o foi mais lenta devido \u00e0 baixa temperatura do processo. Por \n\nfim, um novo modelo baseado na equa\u00e7\u00e3o de BST foi proposto para predizer um maior \n\nn\u00famero de propriedades mec\u00e2nicas dos g\u00e9is biopolim\u00e9ricos, tendo sido observado um bom \n\najuste dos dados e uma \u00f3tima predi\u00e7\u00e3o das propriedades de g\u00e9is de SPI acidificados com \n\nGDL. \n\n\n\n\n\nApendice \n \n\n 243\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAPENDICE: Preliminary studies on the phase separation of \n\nbiopolymers mixtures.\n\n\n\n\n\nApendice \n \n\n 245\n\n1. Importance of the phase separation procedure. \n\nThe existence of a water-in-water emulsion at biopolymer concentrations near the \n\nbinodal curve is reported and it can be obtained by mixing two complete separated phases \n\nin a PRrp-PSrp ratio of 1/99 or vice-versa (Capron et al., 2001; Guido et al., 2002; Antonov \n\net al., 2004). However, preliminary studies showed that the thermodynamic equilibrium \n\nbetween the phases as well as the procedure to withdraw the rich-phases are not always a \n\nsimple task. Thus, two protein-polysaccharide mixtures with similar compositions but \n\nprepared according to two different procedures were evaluated under rheo-optics \n\nexperiments (Figure 1) in order to evaluate the effect of phase separation step on the optical \n\nproperties of the systems. For that purpose, the Na-caseinate \u2013 Na-alginate system was \n\nchosen, since this is the most studied water-in-water emulsion system in the literature \n\n(Capron et al., 2001; Guido et al., 2002; Antonov et al., 2004).  \n\n  \n\nFigure 1. Typical 2D-SALS patterns for systems containing Na-alginate. A) Pure 2.8% Na-\n\nalginate solution at rest; B) 0.13% Na-caseinate \u2013 Na-alginate 2.8% system mixed without \n\nthe phase separation step independent of shear rate; C) Polysaccharide rich-phase (0.3% \n\nprotein + 2.7% polysaccharide) of CA system as a function of shear rate. \n\n\n\nApendice \n \n\n 246\n\nFigure 1a shows the SALS pattern at rest for a pure Na-alginate solution and it was \n\nnot observed any scattered light in the flow-vorticity plane, which is typical of a \n\nhomogeneous system. Similar pattern was observed for the optical properties of the \n\npolysaccharide rich phase obtained after phase separation of Na-caseinate \u2013 Na-alginate \n\nsample (Figure 1c). The low intensity scattering of the light observed at very low angles \n\nwas in accordance with the CLSM micrograph at rest, in which was not observed any \n\nprotein at the highest (100x) magnification (Chapter 5 \u2013 1st part). At higher shear rates it \n\nwas not observed light scattering any more, characterizing that the system was completely \n\nmixed at least on the length scales probed by light scattering. The chemical characterization \n\nof PSrp indicated the following composition: 0.3% of protein and 2.7% of polysaccharide, \n\nrevealing that even 0.3% of protein did not contributed to scatter the light. However, a \n\nsystem with similar composition but mixed without the phase separation step shows a high \n\nintensity scattering profile at large angles independent of the shear rate/shear stress applied \n\n(Figure 1b). This indicates the formation of very small dispersed phase (small droplets \n\nscatter at high angles) that was not elongated under shear as observed typically for water-\n\nin-water emulsions (Chapter 5- 2nd part and Antonov et al., 2004). The above results \n\nshowed that (1) systems with similar composition (and also extended to the same \n\ncomposition) but prepared in different manners (with or without phase separation) did not \n\nhave the same optical and consequently rheological behaviour at rest and under shear; (2) a \n\nprevious phase separation process before the preparation of biopolymer mixture is \n\nnecessary to form water-in-water emulsions.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nApendice \n \n\n 247\n\n2. Visual characterization of different protein-polysaccharide mixtures after \n\ncentrifugation. \n\nDifferent biopolymer1-biopolymer2 systems were centrifuged at 60000 x g during \n\n1h (Antonov et al., 2004) and the compatibility/incompatibility (checked by the \n\nmacroscopic phase separation) of the systems are shown in Table 1. All combinations of \n\none protein and one polysaccharide (considering the biopolymers studied in the present \n\nPh.D. thesis) were studied as well as protein1-protein2 and LBG - Na-alginate, since the \n\nlatter polysaccharides are the two most hydrophobic ones (preliminary studies not shown). \n\nThe concentration of each ingredient was chosen taking in consideration the following \n\nfactors: 1) the incompatible region for Na-caseinate \u2013 Na-alginate systems reported in \n\nliterature; 2) a high total biopolymer content to ensure that the sample would be in the \n\nincompatible region of the phase diagram; 3) a zero shear viscosity of the mixture lower \n\nthan 1 Pa.s (value similar to the pure polysaccharide solution shown in Chapter 3) was used \n\nto avoid the influence of the viscosity on a complete phase separation (Clark, 2000, \n\nCavallieri, 2003). \n\nThe systems protein-LBG or Na-caseinte - xanthan revealed to be compatible with a \n\nsingle phase after centrifugation. The same trend was found for the protein-protein and \n\npolysaccharide-polysaccharide mixtures studied, even when an unfolded SPI (denaturation \n\nat 80 oC during 30 min) was present. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nApendice \n \n\n 248\n\nTable 1.

Thus, the incompatibility of SPI-xanthan was also \n\n\n\nApendice \n \n\n 249\n\nchecked for a greater number of samples with different concentrations and without \n\ncentrifugation (at rest). Figure 2 shows a phase diagram for SPI-xanthan mixtures obtained \n\naccording to the guided by eye method at rest after 2 days of the mixture preparation at 25 \n\noC. Systems with more than 5% of protein were incompatible even in the presence of a very \n\nlow polysaccharide concentration (0.02% w/w). However, it was observed the same \n\ndifficulties to withdraw the rich-phases, such that SPI-xanthan mixture was not selected for \n\nfurther phase behaviour studies.  \n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0 5 10\nSPI (% w/w)\n\nX\na\n\nn\nth\n\na\nn\n\n (\n%\n\n w\n/w\n\n)\n\n \n\nFigure 2.

When possible, the protein or \n\npolysaccharide concentrations were kept the same in order to compare the effect of \n\ndifferent biopolymers on phase behaviour. The concentration of gellan (Chapter 5) was \n\nmuch lower than the others polysaccharides concentrations, since gellan gelified at \n\nconcentrations greater than 1%. \n\n3.
