The study was conducted in the Cerrado region in Planaltina, Bras\u00edlia, DF, Brazil, in a randomized \ncomplete block design, arranged in split-split plots, with four replicates. Water regimes (irrigated or rainfed) were \nassigned to the main plots, inter-row management systems to the subplots, and soil layers to the sub-subplots. The \nfollowing soil attributes were determined: total organic carbon, total nitrogen, C/N ratio, carbon and nitrogen stocks, \nbulk density, aggregate stability, total porosity, macroporosity, low-retention microporosity, remaining microporosity, \ncriptoporosity, and total and readily-available water, besides coffee yield. Irrigation of coffee plants, associated with \nbrachiaria intercropped as a cover crop, increased coffee yield and favored chemical and hydrophysical soil attributes, \nimproving soil structure and its ability to store water. Irrigation favors organic carbon stocks in the upper soil layers, \nwhereas brachiaria favors soil physical attributes related to water availability to coffee.\n\nIndex terms: Coffea arabica, Urochloa decumbens, cover crops, soil physical quality, soil porosity, water availability.\n\nAtributos qu\u00edmicos e f\u00edsico-h\u00eddricos de um Latossolo sob \ncafeeiro consorciado com braqui\u00e1ria no Cerrado\n\nResumo \u2013 O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o efeito da irriga\u00e7\u00e3o e da presen\u00e7a de braqui\u00e1ria (Urochloa decumbens) \nnas entrelinhas do caf\u00e9 (Coffea arabica) sobre a produtividade do cafeeiro e sobre os atributos qu\u00edmicos e f\u00edsico-\nh\u00eddricos de um Latossolo Vermelho distr\u00f3fico t\u00edpico. O ensaio foi conduzido na regi\u00e3o do Cerrado, em Planaltina, \nBras\u00edlia, DF, em delineamento de blocos ao acaso, com parcelas sub-subdivididas e quatro repeti\u00e7\u00f5es. Foram \nalocados os regimes h\u00eddricos (irrigado ou n\u00e3o irrigado) nas parcelas, os sistemas de manejo das entrelinhas nas \nsubparcelas e as camadas de solo nas sub-subparcelas. Os seguintes atributos do solo foram determinados: carbono \norg\u00e2nico total, nitrog\u00eanio total, rela\u00e7\u00e3o C/N, estoques de carbono e nitrog\u00eanio, densidade do solo, estabilidade de \nagregados, porosidade total, macroporosidade, microporosidade de baixa reten\u00e7\u00e3o, microporosidade remanescente, \ncriptoporosidade, e disponibilidade de \u00e1gua total e de \u00e1gua prontamente dispon\u00edvel, al\u00e9m da produtividade de caf\u00e9. A \nirriga\u00e7\u00e3o do cafeeiro, associada ao cons\u00f3rcio com braqui\u00e1ria como planta de cobertura, aumentou a produtividade de \ncaf\u00e9 e favoreceu os atributos qu\u00edmicos e f\u00edsico-h\u00eddricos do solo, o que melhorou a estrutura do solo e a sua capacidade \nem armazenar \u00e1gua. A irriga\u00e7\u00e3o favorece o estoque de carbono nas camadas superficiais do solo, enquanto a braqui\u00e1ria \nfavorece os atributos f\u00edsicos do solo relacionados \u00e0 disponibilidade de \u00e1gua para o cafeeiro.\n\nTermos para indexa\u00e7\u00e3o: Coffea arabica, Urochloa decumbens, plantas de cobertura, qualidade f\u00edsica do solo, \nporosidade do solo, disponibilidade de \u00e1gua.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe coffee (Coffea arabica L.) crop is expanding \nin the Cerrado (Brazilian savanna) region of Brazil, \nwith a production of 5.9 million bags in 2013, which \ncorresponds to 15.4% of the Brazilian production \n(Acompanhamento..., 2014). A major climatic \n\ncharacteristic of the Cerrado biome is a well-defined \ndry season during winter and the recurrent occurrence \nof dry spell periods during the rainy season. Therefore, \nirrigation is an essential practice for achieving high \nyields, profitability, and high quality coffee grains \n(Bonomo et al., 2008; Lima et al., 2008; Costa et al., \n2013; Sakai et al., 2013).\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S0100-204X2016000900046\n\n\nChemical and hydrophysical attributes of an Oxisol under coffee 1477\n\nPesq. agropec. bras., Bras\u00edlia, v.51, n.9, p.1476-1483, set. 2016\nDOI: 10.1590/S0100-204X2016000900046 \n\nThe development and expansion of the coffee crop \nin the Cerrado occurred predominantly in Oxisols \n(Eberhardt et al., 2008), a soil class that covers over \n50% of this region. Despite the fact that this soil class \nhas favorable management characteristics, it shows \nstrong chemical and hydrophysical limitations.\n\nAggregate stability is reported to decrease in coffee \nproduction systems without the use of organic residues \nin the inter-rows (Nunes et al., 2010), jeopardizing \nsoil structure. Moreover, Bicalho (2011) concluded \nthat coffee irrigation in the Cerrado region favored \naggregation and total organic carbon (TOC) on soil \nsurface, when associated with cover crops in between \ncoffee rows.\n\nRocha et al. (2014) observed that brachiaria, \nUrochloa decumbens (Stapf) R.D. Webster, improves \nsoil quality due to the direct action of its roots on \nsoil structure. This forage is very used in the Cerrado \nregion, but it is commonly considered an invasive \nand potentially competitive weed to the coffee \ncrop (Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2012; Siqueira et al., 2015). \nHowever, its high adaptability, appropriate architecture \nfor intercropping in coffee production system, easy \nnatural reseeding, hardiness, easy maintenance, and \nresistance to mechanization are features that qualify \nthis species as a potential cover crop in the inter-rows \nof coffee trees (Wutke et al., 2014).\n\nThe objective of this work was to evaluate the effect \nof irrigation and of the presence of brachiaria (Urochloa \ndecumbens) in between coffee (Coffea arabica) rows \non coffee yield and on chemical and hydrophysical \nattributes of a Typic Haplustox.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nThe experimental area is located at Embrapa \nCerrados (15\u00b035'4''S, 47\u00b043'51''W, at 1,009-m altitude) \nin Planaltina, Bras\u00edlia, DF, Brazil. Soil attributes were \nstudied in a Latossolo Vermelho distr\u00f3fico t\u00edpico, i.e., \na Typic Haplustox, and an area with native Cerrado \nvegetation was used as reference (Table 1). From \n2000 to 2007, the experimental area was covered \nwith brachiaria, but it had not been used as pasture. \nOn December 2007, 'Catua\u00ed Vermelho IAC 144' coffee \nseedlings were planted with 3.50x0.70-m spacing. \nAt planting, fertilization consisted of 120 g triple \nsuperphosphate, 50 g magnesium thermophosphate \n(Yoorin \u2013 Minera\u00e7\u00e3o Curimbaba Ltda., Po\u00e7os de Caldas, \nMG, Brazil), and 24.5 g fritted trace elements (FTE) \n\nper plant. Previously, 2 Mg ha-1 dolomitic limestone \nwere broadcasted and incorporated in the whole area, \nin order to increase soil base saturation to 50%. In the \nfollowing years, the nutritional management of the \ncrop was carried out according to Guerra et al. (2007).\n\nTwo water regimes were evaluated: irrigated, \naccording to the recommendations of Guerra et al. \n(2007); and a rainfed treatment. The irrigations were \ndiscontinued from the end of June until the beginning \nof September in each year, in order to induce uniform \nflowering after resuming irrigation (Guerra et al., 2007). \nSoil water content was measured with the soil moisture \nsensor ML1 (Delta-T Devices Ltd., Cambridge, United \nKingdom).\n\nInter-row management systems consisted of \nbrachiaria intercropped in between rows of coffee \nplants, and of a traditional planting system without \nbrachiaria. In the brachiaria-covered treatment, cover \nplants were mechanically cut when they reached 0.60-\nm height; and, in the traditional treatment, the soil was \nkept free of brachiaria or any other weed by manual \ncleaning. Plant residues remained on the soil surface.\n\nTable 1.

A composite \nsample of five subsamples from each plot was analyzed \nfor TOC and total nitrogen by the Walkley-Black and \nBremner-Mulvaney methods, respectively (Claessen, \n1997), and their respective stocks were calculated with \nthe soil layer and equivalent soil mass methods (De \nBona et al., 2006). The soil from a native Cerrado area, \nadjacent to the experimental area, was considered as  \nreference.\n\nTwo soil samples from each layer were collected \nto determine aggregate stability. These samples were \nsieved using 8 and 4-mm meshes. The retained soil \nwas analyzed, and, from these unstructured samples, \ntwo 50-g subsamples were taken, one to determine \nmoisture level and the other to determine aggregate \nstability according to Claessen (1997). The mean \nweight diameter of stable aggregates was calculated \nas described in Netto et al. (2009) and Coutinho et al. \n(2010).\n\nIn March 2012, soil hydrophysical properties were \nanalyzed in unstructured and structured soil samples, \ncollected on the projection of the coffee plant canopy. \nStructured soil samples were taken with metal rings (50-\nmm diameter and 51-mm height) for determining soil \nbulk density and water retention capacity (Costa et al., \n2008) in the soil-water tensions of 1, 3, 6, 10, 33, 60, \n100, and 1,500 kPa. The soil-water retention curve was \nadjusted according to the model (Genuchten, 1980),\n\n? ? ? ? ??= + ?( ) +( )??\n?\n?{ }r s r m n\nm\n\n1 ,\n\nin which: ? is the soil water content (m3 m-3); ?s is the \nsaturated soil water content (m3 m-3); ?r is the residual \nwater content (m3 m-3); ?m is the soil water matric \npotential (kPa); and ?, m, and n are the empirical \nparameters of the equation, obtained with the NLIN \nprocedure of the SAS software, version 9.2 (SAS \nInstitute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Soil texture was \ndetermined with the pipette method, in the unstructured \nsampled soil (Claessen, 1997).\n\nSoil water availability was obtained from total \navailable water (TAw) and readily-available water \n(RAw), with the expressions: Taw = ?6 - ?1,500 and  \nRAw = ?6 - ?100, in which ?6, ?100, and ?1,500 are the \nvolumetric moisture at the matric potential of 6, 100, \nand 1,500 kPa, respectively.\n\nPore size determination was based on Resck et al. \n(2008). The relative distribution of pore size was \ncalculated by separating the pores according to their \ndiameter, as: macropores, micropores with low-water \nretention, remaining micropores, and cryptopores \n(Rocha et al., 2014).\n\nThe experiment was carried out in a randomized \ncomplete block design, with a split-split-plot \narrangement and four replicates, considering water \nregimes as the main plot, inter-row management systems \nas the subplot, and soil layers as the sub-subplots. Data \nnormality was checked with the Shapiro-Wilk test, \nfollowed by analysis of variance (Anova), and Tukey\u2019s \ntest was used to compare the means, at 5% probability. \nThe effects of water regimes and inter-row management \nsystems on soil attributes were evaluated with principal \ncomponent analysis (PCA). Statistical analyzes were \ncarried out using PCA with XLSTAT 2014 (Addinsoft, \nNew York, NY, USA) and the SAS software, version \n9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nTreatments did not differ as to total available water, soil \ndensity, and soil C/N ratio. However, significant effects \nof the inter-row management system were observed \non micropores of low-water retention and on readily-\navailable water. Differences were also significant among \nsoil layers for remaining micropores and total nitrogen \nstock. For macropores, significant differences were \nfound for water regimes and for inter-row management \nsystems (Table 2). In addition, significant interactions \nwere detected between water regimes and soil layers \nfor total porosity, cryptopores, TOC, and carbon stock. \nThere were also significant interactions between water \nregimes and inter-row management systems for yield, \nbesides a triple significant interaction among water \nregimes, inter-row management systems, and soil layers \nfor the mean weight diameter of soil aggregates (Tables \n3, 4, and 5).\n\nIrrigation decreased macropores in 9.8% and \ncovered inter-row in 4.9% (Table 2). These decreases \nenhance soil-water retention capacity and, as long as \nthey do not negatively affect soil aeration, they are \nbeneficial for water use efficiency and conservation. \nIn the experimental area, the soil had total porosity \nof 0.61 m3 m-3 and average volume of macropores of  \n0.21 m3 m-3, considered a good aeration level according \nto Rodrigues et al. (2011).\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S0100-204X2016000900046\n\n\nChemical and hydrophysical attributes of an Oxisol under coffee 1479\n\nPesq. agropec. bras., Bras\u00edlia, v.51, n.9, p.1476-1483, set. 2016\nDOI: 10.1590/S0100-204X2016000900046 \n\nGrowing brachiaria in the inter-rows of coffee plants \nincreased the fraction of micropores with low-water \nretention from 17.6 to 20.1%, when compared with the \ntraditional system without the forage. This represented \na significant increase of 18.2% in the readily-available \nwater (Table 2). These results agree with those \nreported by Rocha et al. (2014), which attribute them \nto the aggregating action of the brachiaria root system. \nHowever, the remaining micropores were not affected by \nwater regime and inter-row management. Despite this, \nthey were differentiated in the soil layers: the top layer, \nfrom 0.00 to 0.05 m (A), differed significantly from the \nnext two layers from 0.05 to 0.10 m (B) and from 0.10 to \n0.20 m (C), but without any effect on soil water storage.\n\nSignificant differences were observed in total \nnitrogen and nitrogen stock in the soil, when \ncomparing layer C to the other ones (Table 2). Total \nnitrogen decreased from soil layer A to C, from 1.88 to \n1.63 g kg-1. Actually, the nitrogen stock in the top 0.10 \nm of soil, i.e., layers A and B (1.74 Mg ha-1) was 13% \nhigher than that of the following 0.10 m, that is, layer \nC (1.54 Mg ha-1). According to Rangel &amp; Silva (2007), \nsoil nitrogen stocks are mainly controlled by climatic \nconditions and vegetation cover, and the introduction \nof new species with great biomass production capacity \ncan benefit soil nitrogen storage (Mielniczuk et al., \n2003), particularly on the top soil layers that are more \nexposed to climate and management practices.\n\nThe irrigated regime increased productivity in both \ninter-row management systems (Table 3), whereas the \nrainfed regime decreased production, due to brachiaria \ncompetition with coffee plants. It should be noted \n\nthat irrigation increased productivity in 47.1 and 33.3 \nbags per hectare, respectively, when compared to the \nrainfed condition with and without brachiaria in the \ninter-rows. These results indicate an outstanding effect \nof irrigation on coffee productivity, which agrees \nwith Bonomo et al. (2008). Regarding the inter-row \nmanagement systems, the presence of brachiaria \nincreased coffee productivity in 10%, in the irrigated \ntreatment, and reduced it in 42%, in the rainfed one, \ndue to severe competition for water and nutrients.\n\nWater regimes and soil layers interacted regarding \ntotal porosity, cryptopores, TOC, and carbon stock \n(Table 4). Irrigation was the major factor affecting \ntotal porosity, with significant difference of -7% \nbetween soil layers A and C. Furthermore, significant \ndifferences, also of -7%, occurred between the A layers \nof the irrigated and rainfed treatments. This indicates \nthat soil surface layers of irrigated crops are highly \nsusceptible to soil compaction.\n\nIrrigation had a direct effect on the cryptopore \nfraction (Table 4). In layer A, it reduced in 12.5% from \nrainfed to irrigated regimes. Moreover, the differences \nin cryptopores between layers A and B amounted to \n7.5%. According to Tognon et al. (1997), cryptopores \nare the intra-aggregate pores in non-anthropized soils, \nand changes found in pore size distribution result from \nthe arrangement of these aggregates. The results of \nthe present work indicate that, in agricultural soils, \nirrigation is an important factor directly affecting the \npresence of cryptopores.\n\nTOC was higher in the top 0.10-m soil layer of the \nirrigated plots (Table 4). However, differences were \n\nTable 2.

This 15% increase \nwas probably due to irrigation effects on the root system \ndistribution of brachiaria and coffee plants, as well as to \nthe greater production of organic residues in the irrigated \nplots. Considering layers A and B, average TOC in \nirrigated plots increased 24%, in comparison to layer \nC; however, in the rainfed treatments, no significant \ndifferences were observed between soil layers. In \ngeneral, about 50% TOC was stored in the top 0.10 m of \nsoil. This result agrees with Rangel et al. (2008).\n\nThe behavior of carbon stocks in relation to water \nregime and soil layers was similar to that observed \nfor TOC (Table 4). Significant differences were only \nfound in the B layer that showed a 15% increase in \ncarbon stocks under irrigation, compared to rainfed \nconditions. Carbon stock in the top 0.10 m represented \n46 and 54% of the total stock from 0.00 to 0.30 m, \nin rainfed and irrigated treatments, respectively. The \ntotal amounts and the relative distribution of organic \ncarbon in the soil profile can be affected by soil \nclass, water deficit intensity, and management system \n(De Bona et al., 2006). However, in perennial crops \nlike coffee, in which the soil is hardly disturbed, there \nis a tendency for organic matter preservation in the top \n\nsoil layers, where most of the root system of the coffee \ntrees is found.\n\nIn the present study, carbon stock in the top 0.20-m \nsoil layer averaged 49.5 Mg ha-1, in the coffee tree \ncanopy projection. This value is 28% higher than the \none reported by Silva et al. (2013), in a Typic Haplustox \ncultivated with 'Catua\u00ed' coffee trees. The difference of \n10.7 Mg ha-1 between studies can be partially explained \nby the presence of brachiaria for seven years before the \ninstallation of this experiment.\n\nTable 5 presents a triple interaction of the mean \nweighted diameter of soil aggregates, which increased \n33% in soil layer A with irrigation and brachiaria in the \ninter-rows, in comparison to the rainfed plots. However, \nthe lack of inter-row cultivation with brachiaria \nnegatively affected aggregate stability, decreasing \nmean weight diameter in 28%. This allows to compare \nthe aggregation state of different types of soils and \nsoil layers (Kato et al., 2010). Since the effect of soil \nmanagement on aggregate stability is mainly controlled \nby the size of aggregates, decreases in stability indicate \na deleterious effect of the management system on soil \nstructure (Souza et al., 2004).\n\nUnder irrigation, brachiaria increased the mean \nweight diameter by 34% (Table 5), an evidence of \nthe positive effect of this treatment on the stability of \naggregates. However, the presence of the forage in \nthe rainfed treatments decreased this attribute in 27%. \nAnalogously, considering each soil layer in relation to \nthe water regime and management system, layer B had \na 27% higher mean weight diameter than the top soil \nlayer A, in the irrigated treatment without brachiaria \nplanted in the inter-rows. This indicates a loss of \naggregate stability in the 0.05-m layer, probably due \nto the direct exposure of the top soil to management \npractices, since this result was not observed with the \npresence of brachiaria. In this regard, grasses have a \nstrong, abundant root system that, upon decomposition, \n\nTable 3.

The average mean weight \ndiameter of layers A and C, for this same treatment, \nwas higher (4.75 mm) than the ones observed in the \nCerrado (4.60 mm).\n\nA clear interaction effect of irrigation and brachiaria \npresence on soil aggregation was found, considering \nthe parameters related to soil water storage. Two \nprincipal components (PC1 and PC2) were generated \nas tools to reveal the effects of water regimes and inter-\n\nrow management systems on mean weight diameter, \nas well as of its impacts on readily-available water, \nmacropores, and low-water retention micropores. \nThe factorial charges for these variables are shown in \nTable 7. For the distribution of the selected variables \nover the soil layers, a cumulative variance of 77.91% \nwas observed, resulting from the sum of PC1 and \nPC2 for the variables mean weight diameter, low-\nwater retention micropores, macropores, and readily-\navailable water. However, PC1 was responsible for \n53.05% of the variance, distinguishing the coordinates \ninto two groups: irrigated system with brachiaria as  \ncover crop and rainfed traditional system (Figure 1).\n\nThese results support previous discussions related to \nthe absolute values of the analyzed variables, especially \nfor water storage. Macroporosity was favored in \nthe rainfed traditional system (without brachiaria), \nindicating less structure for soil water storage; however, \nthe soil water storage capacity, evaluated by readily-\navailable water and low-water retention micropores, \nwas enhanced in the irrigated treatment with brachiaria \ndue to an improved soil aggregation (mean weight \ndiameter).

In the Cerrado region, the association of irrigation \nand brachiaria (Urochloa decumbens) in the coffee \n(Coffea arabica) crop inter-rows favors several soil \nchemical and hydrophysical attributes, improving \nsoil structure and its water storage capacity, and also \nimproves the mean weight diameter of soil aggregates.\n\n2. The irrigated water regime affects total soil \nporosity, macroporosity, and cryptoporosity, besides \nthe location of total organic carbon on the soil profile, \nfavoring the stock on soil surface layers.\n\n3. The coffee crop intercropped with brachiaria \nincreases the fraction of readily-available water due to an \nincreased number of low-retention micropores in the soil.\n\n4. In rainfed coffee crop with brachiaria in the inter-\nrows, the forage may compete severely with coffee \ntrees, drastically reducing their productivity.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nTo Cons\u00f3rcio Pesquisa Caf\u00e9 and to Empresa \nBrasileira de Pesquisa Agropecu\u00e1ria (project No. \n02.13.02.003.00.02), for financial support.\n\nReferences\n\nACOMPANHAMENTO DA SAFRA BRASILEIRA [DE] CAF\u00c9: \nsafra 2014: quarto levantamento, Bras\u00edlia, DF, v.1, n.3, dez. 2014. 51p.\n\nBICALHO, I.M.
