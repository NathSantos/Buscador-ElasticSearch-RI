To ensure\nacceptable reservoir performance in hydrocarbon production, it is critical to assess the\nreactivation tendencies of existing faults. In this work, a numerical approximation is\npresented that allows quasi-static deformation coupled with monophasic flow considering\ncompressible constituents. Two dimensional modeling is carried out using the theory of\nlinear poroelasticity and a new treatment of poroelastic equations defined into a multi-\nphysics data structure. Dimensionless forms of poroelasticity equations are presented and\nseveral analytic and semi analytic solutions, as well as poroelastic inclusion theory were\nreproduced with the proposed implementation in order to validate it. The computational\nmodel is used to evaluate the stress changes around and into the reservoir in order to assess\nthe fault reactivation tendency at different scenarios. Fault reactivation tendency result-\ning from induced stress changes was calculated using the Coulomb failure stress change\nmethod for definition of the shear slip potential along pre-existing faults at one specific\ntime associated to pore pressure change. It was found that fault reactivation tendency\ndepends on the reservoir geometry, poroelastic properties of the reservoir and surround-\ning rocks, reservoir geometry, static friction coefficient, and pore pressure distribution.\nA numerical study about the accuracy of surrounding material dimensions is presented\nand several scenarios with different depletion programs were evaluated to determine the\ninfluence of the production rates over fault reactivation tendency.\n\nKeywords: Poroelasticity, Finite Element Method, Galerkin Method, Faults (Geology).\n\nxi\n\n\n\n\n\nResumo\n\nA reativac?a?o de falhas, resultante de variac?o?es na pressa?o de poros, pode ocasionar ativi-\ndades s??smicas, subside?ncia, dano nos poc?os e criac?a?o de caminhos de escape dos fluidos\ncontidos nos reservato?rios. Para se garantir uma produc?a?o de hidrocarbonetos eficiente,\nmostra-se um fator cr??tico a avaliac?a?o das tende?ncias de reativac?a?o das falhas existentes no\nmeio poroso. Neste trabalho, apresenta-se uma aproximac?a?o nume?rica para uma ana?lise\nde deformac?a?o quase-esta?tica com escoamento monofa?sico, considerando a compressibil-\nidade da rocha e dos fluidos. Um modelo bidimensional foi empregado considerando a\nteoria de poroelasticidade linear e un novo tratamento da poroelasticidade atrave?s de\nestruturas de dados multif??sicos. Formas adimensionais das equac?o?es de poroelastici-\ndade sa?o apresentadas, juntamente com a reproduc?a?o de diversas soluc?o?es anal??ticas e\nsemi-anal??ticas das mesmas em semiespac?os, com o propo?sito de se validar o algoritmo\ndesenvolvido. O modelo computacional foi utilizado para avaliar as mudanc?as de tensa?o,\nno reservato?rio e em suas fronteiras, com o objetivo de se estudar as tende?ncias reativac?a?o\nde falhas em diferentes cena?rios. As tende?ncias de reativac?a?o de falhas, resultantes da\ninduc?a?o de variac?o?es de tensa?o na rocha, foram calculadas atrave?s do me?todo de variac?a?o\nde tensa?o de ruptura de Coulomb para a definic?a?o das sec?o?es com potencial de desloca-\nmento por tenso?es cisalhante das falhas pre-existentes em tempos espec??ficos, associados\ncom as alterac?o?es na pressa?o de poros. Mostrou-se que a reativac?a?o de falhas depende da\ngeometria de reservato?rio, das propriedades poroela?sticas da rocha, coeficiente de atrito\ne a distribuc?a?o da pressa?o de poros. Um estudo sobre precisa?o dos calculos baseado na\ndimensa?o do material circundante e? apresentada e va?rios cena?rios com diferentes progra-\nmas deplec?a?o foram avaliados para determinar a influe?ncia das taxas de produc?a?o sobre\na tende?ncia de reactivac?a?o das falhas.\n\nPalavras-chave: Poroelasticidade, Me?todo de Elementos Finitos, Galerkin, Me?todos de,\nFalhas (Geologia).\n\nxiii\n\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n1 Introduction 1\n1.1 Research motivation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\n1.2 Literature review . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2\n\n1.2.1 Poroelasticity in reservoir engineering . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2\n1.2.2 Induced seismicity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2\n1.2.3 Continuous Galerkin (CG) method . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10\n\n1.3 Research objectives . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11\n1.4 Outline of dissertation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12\n\n2 Theoretical concepts 13\n2.1 Small deformations in porous media . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13\n2.2 Poroelastic formulation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14\n\n2.2.1 Main assumptions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14\n2.2.2 Fluid potential and excess pore pressure . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16\n2.2.3 Darcy\u2019s law . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17\n2.2.4 Strong formulation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22\n2.2.5 Dimensionless Strong Formulation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24\n\n2.3 Fault Reactivation according to the inclusion theory . . . . . . . . . . . . . 26\n2.3.1 Main assumptions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27\n2.3.2 Theoretical concepts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 28\n2.3.3 Assessment of fault reactivation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30\n\n2.4 Summary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 32\n\n3 Continuous Galerkin Formulation 33\n3.1 Weak Formulation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 33\n3.2 Variational formulation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 35\n\n3.2.1 Mass conservation equation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 35\n\nxv\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Equilibrium Equation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37\n3.3 Bilinear Forms . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 38\n3.4 Spatial discretization . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 39\n3.5 Time discretization . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 42\n3.6 Summary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 44\n\n4 Implementation and validation 45\n4.1 Implementation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 45\n4.2 Computational Tests . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 52\n4.3 Step load applied to an elastic half space . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 52\n4.4 Mass source injection into a bounded infinite poroelastic medium . . . . . 62\n4.5 Summary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 68\n\n5 Fault reactivation 69\n5.1 The rectangular reservoir problem . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 69\n\n5.1.1 Fault reactivation threshold . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 78\n5.1.2 Side burden dimensions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 79\n5.1.3 Friction coefficient variation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 82\n5.1.4 Material contrast . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 82\n5.1.5 Tilted reservoir . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 85\n5.1.6 Reservoir geometry . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 85\n\n5.2 Reservoir with non-constant pressure distribution . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 85\n5.2.1 Reservoir depletion due to one well . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 85\n5.2.2 Reservoir depletion due to injection-production scheme . . . . . . . 91\n\n5.3 Summary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 98\n\n6 Discussion 99\n6.1 Main results . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 99\n6.2 Conclusions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 99\n6.3 Recommendations for future work . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100\n\nA Dimensionless forms 109\nA.1 Computation of dimensionless forms . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 109\n\nB Contribute Method 113\nB.1 Poroelastic Contribute Method . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 113\n\nC GID Mat Template 119\nC.1 GID Mat Template . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 119\n\nxvi\n\n\n\nList of Figures\n\n1.1 Fault reactivation problem divided in two parts.

Introduction\n\n1.1 Research motivation\n\nPorous media like rocks are solid skeletons containing pores connected and filled with\nfluids in different phases (gas, oil and water). The deformation of the solid matrix and\nthe flow of fluids are intrinsically coupled; for practical purposes, it can be neglected,\nbut the manifestation of the pore pressure effect of solid deformation made it an impor-\ntant phenomenon in a number of engineering situations. A good grasp of this physical\nmechanism can equip engineers with the necessary insight to diagnose the poroelastic\neffect for their problems on hand. In general, the diffusion of fluid pressure is followed by\nthe deformation of the porous rock and is a time-dependent process. The mathematical\ntheory of linear poroelasticity was first established by Terzaghi (1943) and Biot (1941).\nFrom this time forth, poroelasticity has had many important applications in different ar-\neas: petroleum engineering, civil engineering and biomedical engineering. Specifically in\npetroleum engineering, the effective management of underground fluid extraction relies\non the trustworthy evaluation of the subsidence of the ground surface, fault reactivation,\nwell damage and the creation of fluid leakage paths in the recent applications. However,\nlinear poroelastic problems that can be solved analytically are limited due to the complex\ncoupled nature of the problem. In particular for reservoir fault reactivation, several ana-\nlytical and semi-analytical approaches have been developed with several limitations and\nideal assumptions.\nIn practical applications, generally, we have to seek numerical solutions as tools for solving\nthis kind of problems. In the numerical approximation of geomechanical consolidation, the\nmost popular numerical method is the continuous Galerkin (CG) finite element method in\nparticular in commercial finite element packages. In this work, a non-commercial imple-\nmentation oriented to solve fault reactivation problems by means of the inclusion theory\nin linear poroelasticity is developed. Consequently, it can be used to model problems with\nvery complex geometries, material contrast, as well as it can exploit the advantages of\nnumerical approximations.\n\n1\n\n\n\n2 Chapter 1. Introduction\n\n1.2 Literature review\n\n1.2.1 Poroelasticity in reservoir engineering\n\nMuskat, in the 1930\u2019s, considered storage effects resulting primarily from fluid expan-\nsion and assumed that rocks were considered as an incompressible material at reservoir\ndepths. Fluid expansion, however, could not explain the extra production in the East\nTexas Oil Field. He deemed the high production to be due to highly compressible gas\nor water drive mechanism from the reservoir peripheries. Jacob (1940) suggested alter-\nnatively that the high production rate was due to the compressibility of sand and clays.\nInitially, poroelasticity was used in petroleum engineering to understand subsidence, es-\ntimate hydrocarbon volumes and predict stresses around boreholes. The subsidence of\nGoosse Creek oil field described by Pratt (1926) was the first conceptual realization of\nthe coupling between large volumes of fluid extraction and large scale mechanical defor-\nmation. Since the problem of large groundwater withdrawals from aquifers is identical,\nGeertsma, who was affiliated with Shell in the Netherlands, studied the effect of pore fluid\ndecline on volumetric changes of rocks (Geertsma, 1957). The groundwater subsidence\nliterature in the 1970\u2019s used analytical and numerical techniques introduced by Geertsma\nand most recently used by Segall to connect hydrocarbon extraction with induced seismic-\nity (Segall, 1987). Poroelasticity research in the 1940\u2019s and 1950\u2019s was oriented primarily\ntoward rock mechanics. Hughes (1953) made laboratory measurements of pore compress-\nibilities to correct the available pore space at reservoir conditions. Poroelasticity research\ncontinues in petroleum engineering and geophysics in the use of hydraulic fracturing as\na technique for measuring earth stresses, geomechanical behavior of reservoirs and its in-\nteractions with side-burden rocks, faults, and another structural elements (Germanovich,\n2004).\n\n1.2.2 Induced seismicity\n\nInjection induced seismicity\n\nCurrently, it is widely accepted that fluid injection into the subsurface environment does\ninduce seismicity, in other words the fluid injection can trigger small earthquakes that\nevidence the induced seismicity (i.e, the in-situ stress changes along an existing fault\nor fracture of an extremely low seismic magnitude). The most well-known example of\ninjection-induced seismicity is probably given by the earthquakes triggered by fluid injec-\ntion at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal (RMA), northeast of Denver, Colorado in 1967 (Hsieh\nand Bredehoeft, 1981). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers drilled deep injection wells at\nRMA in 1962 for disposal of contaminated waste water. Waste fluid was injected into a\n\n\n\n1.2. Literature review 3\n\nfractured reservoir in the Precambrian bedrock below the RMA between 1962 and 1966.\nDuring this 4-year period, a total of 625 million of liters of waste fluid were disposed off in\nthe wells. Shortly after the injection of fluids started, small earthquakes were detected in\nthe Denver area. There was an apparent correlation between the volume of fluid injected\ninto the well and the number of earthquakes generated. In 1967, one year after the fluid\ninjection was interrupted, there were three major earthquakes in the Denver area. This\nwas attributed to the migration of the pressure front developed (Hsieh and Bredehoeft,\n1981). After 1967, the number of earthquakes began to decline and by the 1980\u2019s, the\nswarm of seismic activity had virtually disappeared.\nAnother example of experimentation with fluid injection-induced seismicity is given by\nthe German Continental Deep Drilling Program (KTB), which was designed to increase\nthe knowledge of crustal stresses based on borehole measurements and to directly test\nthe frictional equilibrium hypothesis by evaluating whether relatively small pore pressure\nperturbations could trigger micro-earthquakes (Zoback and Harjes, 1997). The injection\nof 200 m3 of KBr/KCl brine into a 70 m open-hole section at the bottom of the 9.1 km\nmain borehole induced almost 400 micro-earthquakes at an average depth of 8.8 km. Most\nof the earthquakes were determined to be strike-slip events by focal plane mechanisms\nand had a NNW trending, essentially parallel to the major horizontal compressive stress.\nThe largest induced earthquake, of magnitude M = 1.2, occurred 18 h after the beginning\nof injection (Zoback and Harjes, 1997). The study suggested that many earthquakes were\ninduced by very small pore pressure changes ( 1 MPa) less than 1 percent more than the\nsurrounding (approximately hydrostatic) pore pressure at depth.\nThe exploitation of the Romashikinskoye oil field, the largest in Europe, located on the\nsouth part of the Tatarstan arch (Russia), began in the 1960\u2019s using water flooding as\na secondary recovery method (Galybin, 1998). Observations showed that there was a\ntime-dependent correlation between the beginning of the water injection and the seismic\nactivity. Based on these observations, Galybin (1998) developed a quantitative mechanical\nmodel to address the influence of pore pressure on fault movements. He followed the\noriginal work by Hubbert (1959) and used the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion for fault\nstability. Their model showed that the water flooding method may induce seismic events\nin historically aseismic regions and increase the magnitude of natural earthquakes in\ntectonically active regions.\nAs noted by Nicholson and Wesson (1992), ), in each of the well-documented examples of\ninjection induced seismicity, there were three common characteristics; first, there was a\nclose geological connection between the fluid injection zones and the earthquake locations;\nsecond, the measured or inferred in-situ stress and the measured pore pressure pointed\nout that the frictional strength along the favorably oriented pre-existing faults was sur-\npassed; and third, there was a clear difference between any previous seismic history and\n\n\n\n4 Chapter 1. Introduction\n\nthe induced earthquakes, which are often characterized by swarms of small shallow earth-\nquakes lasting as long as the elevated pore pressures exists. It is now well understood that\ninjection-induced seismicity is caused by the pore pressure increase allowing the inferred\nstresses in the Earth\u2019s crust to overcome the threshold for frictional sliding along favor-\nably oriented pre-existing faults (Nicholson and Wesson, 1992). Since the shear stresses\nin the poroelastic constitutive relations (Detournay, 1993), are not affected by the pore\npressure, it is usually assumed that the pre-existing shear stress is the main driving force\nfor fault slip caused by the shear strength reduction due to the increased pore pressure.\n\nExtraction induced seismicity\n\nTriggered or induced earthquakes, which spatially correlate with areas of massive fluid\nwithdrawal, can be classified into two rather broad categories (Nicholson and Wesson,\n1992): (1) shallow and (2) deep induced earthquakes. The former occur near or within\nthe producing zone and exhibit, in general, normal or reverse faulting focal mechanisms\n(studied in this work). They can be linked to the rapid subsidence and poroelastic strain\nchanges due to the extraction of large volumes of fluid (Segall, 1987). The latter occur\nnear the seismogenic zone base, often show signs of thrust focal mechanism and may\nbe related to stress and/or strain changes due to the unloading effects of the removal\nof large amounts of fluid from the area undergoing crustal convergence. They are more\nambiguous and much larger in magnitude than shallow induced earthquakes, and are\nmuch more difficult to separate from the background seismicity.\nThe first well documented example of shallow induced seismicity correlated with hydro-\ncarbon extraction was probably given by Pratt (1926). In the Goose Creek oil field, in\nGalveston Bay, south Texas, production began in 1917 at depths ranging from 300 m to\n1200 m, and by 1925, there was recorded surface subsidence by as much as 1 m centring\nover the producing field. Subsidence was accompanied by small earthquakes, and several\nnormal faults developed along the field margins breaking the ground. Since then, in many\nother cases around the world, it has been possible to identify seismicity correlated with\nfluid withdrawal.\nProbably, the most studied example of extraction-induced seismicity is that of the Lacq\ngas field where seismic events have been monitored for more than 25 years (Feignier, 1990;\nGrasso, 1992; Guyoton and Volant, 1992; Segall, 1994; Lahaie and Boyer, 1998). Since the\nonset of production in 1957, 220109 m3 of gas had been produced by 1995 and the reservoir\npressure progressively declined from 66 MPa to 35 MPa in 1969 to 16 MPa in 1987 to 7.5\nMPa in 1995 at 3700 m depth. The first seismic event was recorded in 1969, roughly 10\nyears after the gas exploitation started. Since 1974, when the local seismological network\nwas deployed, more than 1000 seismic events with the largest magnitude (M = 4.2) in\n1978 have been recorded in a historically aseismic region. More than 90 percent of the\n\n\n\n1.2. Literature review 5\n\nepicentres were located in the hydrocarbon field. Surface subsidence of about 60 mm has\nbeen observed over the 40 years of gas production in Lacq field.\n\nSegall (1987) suggested that the poroelastic stressing of the reservoir and surrounding\nrocks, associated with volumetric contraction of the reservoir material, is responsible for\nthe induced seismicity associated with fluid extraction. He suggested a mechanism of\nsurface deformation and faulting associated with fluid extraction. Pore fluid withdrawal\ncauses reduction in the pore pressure within the reservoir, triggering adjustments of the\ngeological structures to perturbations related to the reservoir response to depletion. Ac-\ncording to Segall (1987), poroelastic mechanisms transfer this stress change from the\nreservoir rock to its surroundings where seismic instabilities occur either above or below\nthe reservoir if the faults are sufficiently pre-stressed.\n\nExisting models of depleting hydrocarbon reservoirs\n\nThe increasing number of such cases initiated great interest in studying mechanics of\nfault reactivation, ground subsidence, reservoir deformation, and in-situ stress changes\ncaused by fluid withdrawal e.g. (Geertsma, 1966; Segall, 1987; Teufel, 1991; Morita, 1992;\nGrasso, 1992; Rudnicki, 1999; Hawkes, 2009). In this section, existing models of depleting\nhydrocarbon reservoirs are reviewed. In most cases, the reservoir has been treated as a\n(partially) drained poroelastic inclusion surrounded by an elastic host material. Addi-\ntionally, with conventional numerical modeling (Kosloff and Scott, 1980; Maillot, 1999;\nRoest, 1994; Ferronato, 2008), usually two approaches are implemented: (1) the reservoir\nis modeled as an inclusion with the same material properties as the matrix but with a\ndifferent pore pressure (Geertsma, 1966; Segall, 1987, 1992, 1994); (2) the reservoir is\nmodeled as a uniformly pressurized homogeneous ellipsoidal inclusion with properties dif-\nferent compared to the surrounding rock (Addis, 1998; Rudnicki, 1999). Figure 1.1 shows\na schematic representation of poroelastic inclusion representing the depleted reservoir ?P\nand induced stress changes in side burden rocks that can reactivate part of the pre-existent\nfaults (green lines).\n\n\n\n6 Chapter 1.

Literature review 7\n\nmechanics. Geertsma (1966) treated an isolated volume of reduced pore pressure in a\nporoelastic half-space with a traction-free surface. He considered a disc-shaped, producing\nreservoir separated from its fluid-saturated, semi-infinite surroundings by an impermeable\nbarrier. He assumed that the pore pressure distribution is independent of the displacement\nfield and that the pore pressure can be determined by the uncoupled diffusion equation\nor that it is prescribed from measurements at a given time. Further, assuming that the\nreservoir and surrounding materials are homogeneous and have the same deformation\nproperties, he analyzed the corresponding poroelastic problem using the concept of strain\nnucleus in the half-space, as it was introduced in the theory of thermoelasticity. He then\ncomputed the subsidence above the disc-shaped reservoir by integrating the nucleus solu-\ntion (which, essentially, is a Green\u2019s function) over the entire reservoir volume. Although,\nGeertsma (1966) did not apply his model to induced seismicity, he was able to arrive\nat the important conclusion that the displacement field and subsidence are the result of\nshrinkage or compaction of the reservoir, which in turn depends upon the reservoir pres-\nsure reduction, height of productive interval, rock compressibility, as well as the depth of\nburial and the lateral extent of the reservoir.\nBased on the theory of poroelasticity (Biot, 1941; Rice, 1976; Detournay, 1993; Segall,\n1987) developed a model for computing poroelastic stress changes due to fluid extraction\nfor general axisymmetric reservoir geometries and recovered the results of Geertsma (1966)\nfor a thin disk reservoir with the uniform pressure decrease as a special case. As Geertsma\n(1966), rather than solving for pore pressure distribution, he assumed the pressure within\nthe reservoir is known from the field measurements and reservoir simulations. He further\nassumed that the hydraulic diffusivity of the rocks surrounding the reservoir was suffi-\nciently low so that the deformation outside the reservoir was not drained. However, he\ndid consider the mechanical coupling between the stress and pore pressure and calculated\nthe undrained pore pressure changes outside the reservoir (i.e., ignoring changes in the\nfluid content).\nGeertsma (1966) and Segall (1987) also assumed that the producing reservoir has the same\nelastic properties as the surrounding material to which it is perfectly bonded. He derived\nGreen\u2019s functions equivalent to Geertsma (1966) approach for a radial pressure source (or\nsink). Using these Green\u2019s functions that are essentially identical to those appearing in\nsimilar thermoelastic problems, he was able to model flat reservoirs with arbitrary radial\npressure distributions. Modeling Lacq gas field in France, Segall (1992) calculated the\nporoelastic stresses resulting from production generated decreases in pore pressure and\nsuggested that these perturbed stresses are responsible for earthquakes associated with\nfluid extraction. However, his calculations showed that the perturbing stresses are only\n0.01 MPa, which is at least an order of magnitude smaller than typical stress decrease\n(0.1 - 10 MPa) associated with earthquakes in nature. Therefore, he concluded that\n\n\n\n8 Chapter 1. Introduction\n\nextraction of fluids in Lacq gas field destabilized only those faults that are already near\nthe frictional instability limit, i.e. shear stresses are near to overcome the frictional\nstrength existing on fault planes. Though the stress changes he computed were very\nsmall, he did make a comment that steep pressure gradients in pore pressure could lead\nto local stress concentrations.\nthe models of Geertsma (1966), Segall (1987) and after Segall (1992) were aimed at\naccounting for the main reason for stress redistribution around depleted reservoir: the\nchange in reservoir pore pressure. Not only did they consider the stress changes within\nthe reservoir but also in its surrounding material. After that, Segall (1992) also used\nhis model to analyze the onset of fault instability. Both models assumed the elastic\nproperties of the reservoir to be identical to those of the surrounding material. The fact\nthat the material is homogeneous allowed Geertsma (1966) to consider the interaction\nbetween the reservoir and the Earth\u2019s surface via employing the model of a half-space.\nFurthermore, because the solution was based on the corresponding Green\u2019s function for\nthe homogeneous half-space, it was possible to study non-uniform pressure distributions\nand non-planar reservoirs (Segall, 1992). Even though, in general, the approach requires\nnumerical computing of improper integrals, it is still analytical by nature and allows for\na relatively simple analysis of rather geologically complex cases as, for example Grasso\n(1992), Hawkes (2009).\n\nModels based on ellipsoidal inhomogeneity\n\nThe second approach, by Addis (1998) and Rudnicki (1999), allows for consideration\nof the additional factor of material heterogeneity, i.e., the difference in the properties\nbetween the reservoir and surrounding rocks. Their approach is based on Eschelby\u2019s\nwork (Eshelby, 1957) on ellipsoidal inhomogeneity. Addis (1998) and Rudnicki (1999)\nconsidered the reservoir to be represented by an ellipsoidal inclusion and the overburden\nby the host material. Both the reservoir and the overburden were considered homogeneous\nisotropic poroelastic materials with the properties of the inclusion being different from\nthose of the surrounding material.\nThe inhomogeneity was assumed to be embedded in an infinite medium. This corresponds\nto the reservoir for which the depth from the surface is greater than its lateral extent\n(Rudnicki, 1999). Accordingly, both Addis (1998) and Rudnicki (1999) did not account\nfor the interaction of the depleting reservoir with the free surface. The inhomogeneity\nor inclusion was assumed to be hydraulically isolated so that its pore pressure could\ndiffer from the surrounding material. They also assumed that the reservoir is relatively\npermeable and conductive so that it has a uniform distribution of pore pressure. Finally,\nthey assumed that no pressure change occurs outside the reservoir or, in other words,\nthey assumed drained deformation of the surrounding rock.\n\n\n\n1.2. Literature review 9\n\nModelling the reservoir with a homogeneous ellipsoidal inclusion, with different elastic\nproperties and a pore pressure uniform throughout the reservoir (Mura, 1982), allowed\nAddis (1998) and Rudnicki (1999) to study the effect of various ellipsoidal geometries and\nproperty mismatch on alterations of the local stress state inside the reservoir caused by\nthe pore pressure changes. Addis (1998) considered a large flat oblate horizontal reservoir\n(that is, in the extreme of the infinitesimal aspect ratio) and concluded that the stress-\ndepletion response inside the reservoir decreases with increasing magnitude of Poisson\u2019s\nratio and decreasing value of Biot\u2019s poroelastic parameter of the reservoir material and\nthat the moduli of the reservoir and surrounding rocks have little influence on the stress\nresponse inside the reservoir.\nRudnicki (1999) also considered an axisymmetric inhomogeneity, but, in addition to the\neffect of Poisson\u2019s ratio and the shear modulus, he also studied the influence of the aspect\nratio of the reservoir on the stress depletion response inside the reservoir. He concluded\nthat as the shape of the reservoir becomes flatter (tending in the limit towards a layered\ngeometry), the axial stress perturbation approaches zero, but the approach is slower for\nsmaller values of Poisson\u2019s ratio and the shear modulus of the reservoir material. Further,\nthe strain perturbation within the reservoir approaches to the uniaxial model with the\ndecreasing aspect ratio of the reservoir, but the approach is slower if the shear modulus of\nthe inhomogeneity exceeds that of the surrounding material. In the limit of the infinitesi-\nmal aspect ratio, the effect of contrast in the shear modulus becomes insignificant on both\nthe axial and lateral stress perturbations inside the reservoir. However, the influence of\nPoisson\u2019s ratio becomes insignificant only in the case of axial stress perturbation while\nthe lateral stress perturbation can differ by a few times. Rudnicki (1999) further used the\ncalculated stress paths to evaluate whether the stress state is going towards or away from\nfailure on faults within the reservoir.\nSegall (1994) also used the inclusion method proposed by Eshelby (1957) to compute the\nstress changes occurring within hydrocarbon reservoirs, but considered the properties of\nthe reservoir material to be same as the surrounding material. Their analysis showed\nthat if the regional stress is extensional (i.e., normal faulting stress regime), the Biot\u2019s\ncoefficient is greater than 0.85, Poisson\u2019s ratio is 0.20, the reservoir aspect ratio is 1/26,\nand the coefficient of friction is smaller than 0.5, then normal faulting is promoted within\nthe reservoir itself due to its depletion. Regardless of these conditions, dilatant fracturing\nand normal faulting are always stimulated near the edges of the reservoir or near the\nregions of high-pore pressure gradients at the boundary. In the compressional regional\nstress environment (i.e., reverse faulting stress regime), reverse faulting is stimulated\nabove and below the level of the reservoir due to reservoir depletion.\nSince Addis (1998) and Rudnicki (1999) focused on the stress-depletion response within\nthe reservoir, they did not evaluate the poroelastic deformation and possible fault reac-\n\n\n\n10 Chapter 1. Introduction\n\ntivation outside the reservoir. Nevertheless, although in their model, the reservoir pore\npressure was assumed to be uniform throughout and, therefore, they could not analyze the\ndepletion strategies associated with non-uniform distributions of reservoir pore pressure,\ntheir work demonstrated that indeed, material inhomogeneity is an important factor (in\naddition to the changes in the reservoir pore pressure).\n\n1.2.3 Continuous Galerkin (CG) method\n\nIn terms of geomechanical modeling many techniques have been developed in order to\nsimulate physical processes such as stress/strain behavior, fluid flow, heat transfer and\ndynamic loading in complex situations. They are often used to estimate the effects of\nmining activities on stress/strain behavior of rocks and environmental issues. Many tech-\nniques have been developed such as the finite element, finite difference, discrete element,\ndistinct element (Rejeb, 1996) and boundary element methods. For this work the finite\nelement method is chosen and implemented in a C++ code called LPA (Linear Poroelas-\ntic Analysis), in order to provide a non-commercial option to study the fault reactivation\nissues by means of linear poroelasticity.\nThe most popular numerical techniques for solving poromechanics problems are the con-\ntinuous Galerkin (CG) finite element methods. The first application of the CG finite\nelement methods to model the flow of compressible fluid in porous elastic media be-\ngan in 1969 by Wilson (1973). Their finite element formulation was based on Gurtin\u2019s\nvariational principle (Gurtin, 1964) and applied to three-dimensional soil consolidation\nproblems. The stability of the CG methods was first briefly commented on Wilson (1973).\nHe pointed out that a very small time step resulted in oscillatory pressure for problems\nwith low permeability. However, he didn\u2019t present his unstable results obtained with\nsmall time steps. The earliest appropriate use of finite element spaces for consolidation\nproblems is attributed to Hwang (1971). In his numerical study on plane strain consoli-\ndation problems, a six node triangle was used to represent a quadratic displacement field\nand a three node triangle was selected to represent a linear pore pressure field. These\nproposed finite element spaces happened to represent a stable scheme, which satisfies the\nLadyzhenskaya-Babuska-Brezzi (LBB) inf-sup condition (Brezzi, 1991). However, this\nscheme is not popular in practical applications due to the constraint on approximation\nspaces which requires complex programming. However using the NeoPZ environment,\narbitrary approximation orders can be used for pressure and displacement, consequently\nLBB condition is easily satisfied. Vermeer and Verruijt (1981) were the first who demon-\nstrated nonphysical pressure oscillations in continuous Galerkin (CG) finite element so-\nlutions, which are induced by using small time steps. Their stability analysis was based\non a 1-D problem. They showed that there is a lower bound for the time step, dependent\n\n\n\n1.3. Research objectives 11\n\non the order of the finite elements employed, below which spatial oscillations in pressure\nwill occur. A few techniques have been proposed to remove the oscillation in pressure\nsolution obtained by the popular CG methods. An obvious technique is to use a fine mesh\nor a high order element near the boundary. Indeed, this method can help to alleviate the\noscillation. But it is not able to completely remove the oscillation until an extremely fine\nmesh is used, which is not practical. Sandhu (1977) proposed to use singular elements near\nthe loaded surface. However, the appropriate polynomial order of singular elements could\nexceed 60 degrees, which could be difficult for computer implementations. In fact these\noscillations do not only depend on the LBB condition. They occur for any approximation\nof parabolic problems. An intensive search for an appropriate stabilizing parameter is re-\nquired for this stabilized CG method. Since the (LBB) condition is satisfied, it is easy to\nshow that no considerable oscillations in pressure occur in comparison with cheap linear-\nlinear elements; thus a reasonable approximation can be obtained using cubic-quadratic\nor high order elements for displacement and pressure chosen as state variables.\n\n1.3 Research objectives\nThe main objective of the research presented in this dissertation is to understand the\nfundamental mechanisms of fault reactivation induced by oil production using 2D ge-\nomechanical modelling of oil reservoirs, as well as to develop the corresponding quan-\ntitative numerical implementation. Ideally, any model intended to simulate a physical\nphenomenon should be calibrated against the real data for practical implementation but\nthis is left for future works. Therefore, the suggested implementation is a simple and ro-\nbust platform to generate numerical models, that would allow to do parametric analysis\nand identify the critical issues related to induced reservoir fault reactivation caused by\nhydrocarbon production, following the next specific objectives:\n\n\u2022 To understand fundamental mechanisms of fault reactivation due to reservoir de-\npletion by means of poroelastic effects.\n\n\u2022 To develop a simple, robust, and quantitative numerical model for the depletion of\na hydrocarbon reservoir.\n\n\u2022 To account for both non-uniform pressure distribution within the reservoir and\nmaterial contrast between reservoir and surrounding rocks.\n\n\u2022 To analyze the onset of fault instability caused by the perturbation a known initial\nstress state.\n\n\u2022 To identify the important parameters affecting the fault stability.\n\n\n\n12 Chapter 1. Introduction\n\nThe study focuses on the influence of several geomechanical parameters on stress develop-\nment and fault slip in and around an arbitrary-shaped oil reservoir intersected or not by\na normal or reverse faults that are represented with potential slip surfaces in continuous\nporoelastic media. Attention is given to the development, implementation and quantifi-\ncation methods. Wich include arching, normal, shear stress and fault reactivation factor\nalong faults plane. Parameters include reservoir geometry, reservoir size, depth, tilt angle,\nreservoir shape and surrounding rock properties.\nAs discussed in the previous section, the existing models based on the approach of a ho-\nmogeneous formation accounted for the principal reason of stress redistribution around\ndepleted reservoirs, i.e. a change in reservoir pore pressure, while those utilizing the\napproach of ellipsoidal inclusion accounted for another important factor of material in-\nhomogeneity, but considered uniform pressure distribution inside the reservoir. The next\nnatural step is to account for both the non-uniform reservoir pressure and the material\ninhomogeneity in the model by using this numerical approach.\n\n1.4 Outline of dissertation\nA theoretical review of the constitutive equations for mono-phasic poroelastic model is\ngiven in Chapter 2. Main assumptions made in the model are discussed. A dimension-\nless form of the strong formulation is presented in Chapter 2. Also theoretical concepts\nand a mathematical description of semi-analytical method for fault reactivation using\ninclusion theory are provided in chapter 2. Through 3, the weak statement and finite\nelement continuous Galerkin formulation is presented. The corresponding computational\nimplementation and validation with some analytical solutions is presented in Chapter\n4. Finally fault reactivation tendency caused by the reservoir depletion is analyzed and\nnumerical comparison with STARS Simulator for reservoir geomechanics calculations is\ngiven in Chapter 5. The effect of different depletion strategies (e.g., various pressure dis-\ntributions) as well as of the reservoir rigidity on the onset of fault reactivation are studied.\nChapter 6 summarizes results and conclusions obtained in this work and provides some\nrecommendations for future research.\n\n\n\n2. Theoretical concepts\n\n2.1 Small deformations in porous media\n\nWith the current progress in the mechanics of porous media and non-linear finite element\nanalysis, a finite deformation analysis of coupled problem can be established directly.\nHowever, it is still necessary to establish a separate small deformation formulation for\ncomparison and modeling purposes. First, for some simple cases, it is possible to find\nanalytical solutions under the small deformation assumption. The analytical solutions\ncan be used in the validation of the small deformation analysis, as well as in the finite\ndeformation analysis at small strains. Under the finite deformation assumption, it is more\ndifficult (in most cases impossible) to find an analytical solution. Thus, the small defor-\nmation analysis provides a good comparison to the finite deformation analysis. Second,\nthe results from the small deformation analysis are usually accurate enough in the small\ndeformation regime, and the amount of computer time required in the small deformation\nanalysis is much less than that of the finite deformation analysis. Thus the small defor-\nmation approach is still acceptable and even preferable for engineering problems at small\nstrains. Although the response of near surface earth materials is seldom precisely linear,\nthe theory of linear fluid infiltrated elastic solids has proven to be very useful in studying a\nvariety of geotechnical and geophysical problems. These include soil consolidation (Biot,\n1941), hydraulic fracture (Cleary, 1979), and various aspects of earth faulting (Booker,\n1974; Rudnicki, 1986).\nEven in the small strain regime, there are a number of ways to investigate the transient\nresponse of fluid saturated porous media subject to external loading. The problem can\nbe simplified under different assumptions. In some cases, when the permeability of the\nsaturated rock is very small or large, the problem may be simplified by assuming undrained\nor drained condition. Usually, the undrained condition assumption is valid if the rate of\nloading is much higher than the diffusion of pore fluid. In this case, very little amount\nof pore fluid can escape in transient process, the mass content of fluid in each material\nelement remains essentially constant, and there is no relative displacement between the\nfluid phase and the solid skeleton. On the other hand, if the loading rate is much smaller\n\n13\n\n\n\n14 Chapter 2. Theoretical concepts\n\nthan the diffusion rate of the pore fluid, the pore pressure in each material element can\nbe assumed to remain constant at its hydrostatic level, and does not vary with the solid\nskeleton deformation.\nThe most direct formulation of governing equations for a linear poroelastic solid were\nestablished by Biot (1941), other formulations have been given by Bear (1972), Rice\n(1976), Cleary (1977), Rudnicki (1986) and Wang (2000). A treatment of the equations\nbased on those works is presented in this section.\n\n2.2 Poroelastic formulation\n\n2.2.1 Main assumptions\n\nThe most common and general cases in reality are intermediate. Generally an interaction\nexists between the solid phase and the fluid phase. The pore fluid flows out during\nloading, the pore fluid pressure varies with time. To analyze these cases, a mono-phasic\ncontinuum model must be formulated to incorporate the effect of the transient flow of the\nfluid through the porous media.\nThe following assumptions are introduced in this analysis:\n\n\u2022 No inertial effects, i.e. a quasi-static deformation process.\n\n\u2022 Small deformation regime.\n\n\u2022 Isothermal flow.\n\n\u2022 The flow is governed by diffusive mass flux.\n\n\u2022 Full saturated isotropic solid.\n\n\u2022 The permeability tensor is diagonal.\n\n\u2022 Compressible rock formation. Fluid flow is characterized by Darcy\u2019s law (a thorough\nstudy of Darcy\u2019s law is given for Bear (1972)). Some assumptions are intrinsically\nrelated to Darcy\u2019s law:\n\n\u2022 Fluid phase is homogeneous and Newtonian.\n\n\u2022 No chemical reaction, precipitation or adsorption occurs.\n\n\u2022 There is no electro-kinetic effect.\n\n\n\n2.2. Poroelastic formulation 15\n\nUsed sign convention\nThe sign convention used in this work conforms to the continuum mechanics convention:\nTension stress is defined as a positive field.\n\nState variables\nFor the small deformation analysis, the state of saturated porous media can be fully\nexpressed in the following variables:\n\n\u2022 Excess pore pressure, Pex;\n\n\u2022 The average displacement of the solid phase, u;\n\nThe mass conservation equations of the solid and fluid phases are derived. An arbitrary\nvolume Vvol containing solid and fluid phases is considered. Assuming a fully saturated\nsolid, then the volume occupied by the fluid phase (i.e. f suffix for fluid phase) is ?Vvol.\nLet ?f , ?solid represent the mass density of fluid and solid phase of a continuum, respec-\ntively. The total mass of fluid contained in arbitrary volume Vvol can be written as\n\nmf =\n?\nVvol\n\n?f?dVvolume (2.1)\n\nwhile the total mass of solid contained in the same volume is\n\nmsolid =\n?\nVvol\n\n?solid (1 ??) dVvolume (2.2)\n\nThe balance of mass for the fluid phase gives\n\ndmf\ndt\n\n=\n?\nVvol\n\n?

Mathematically the definition of Hubbert ?H fluid\npotential for any fluid (valid for compressible and incompressible fluid Ertekin (2001)) is:\n\n?H =\n? P\nPdatum\n\n1\n? (P)\n\ndP ?D (2.7)\n\nThe potential gradient is obtained from (2.7)\n\n??H = ?\n(? P\n\nPref\n\n1\n?

(P) = ?f (P) g is the fluid density in terms of pressure per distance usually called\nfluid gravity.\nIn geomechanics a typical problem is to find fluid pore pressure and displacement response\ndue to applied load or to fluid extraction Wang (2000). If the fluid is static in the initial\nstate, it is possible to decompose the total pressure into the sum of hydrostatic pressure\nand an excess pore pressure Pex (figure 2.1). Excess pore pressure is the total pore\npressure minus hydrostatic pressure. Thus Pex is analogue to fluid potential and can be\nexpressed as:\n\nPex = P ??D (2.10)\n\n\n\n2.2. Poroelastic formulation 17\n\nFigure 2.1: Definition of excess pore pressure as decomposed total pressure referred to\nhydrostatic pressure. Source: redraw from Wang (2000).\n\n2.2.3 Darcy\u2019s law\n\nDarcy\u2019s law is an empirical relationship between the flow rate through a porous medium\nand the potential gradient. The Darcy average velocity of fluid phase v?f is given as:\n\nv?f = ?\n?\n\n?\n?? = ?\n\n?\n\n?\n?Pex (2.11)\n\nv?mf = qf = ??f\n?\n\n?\n?? = ??f\n\n?\n\n?\n?Pex (2.12)\n\nwhile v?f is the Darcy velocity, ? is a diagonal absolute permeability tensor.\nDarcy\u2019s law can be considered an empirical or analytical expression derived from the\nNavier Stokes equation (e.g. derivation is presented on Bear (1972)). In either case, it is\nstill the cornerstone of the contemporary reservoir simulation.\nIt is important to point out that the mass balance in the petroleum industry really are\nthe volume conservation equations written in terms of volumetric volume factors of each\nphase; the basis for this mass balance is the volume of each phase at stock-tank conditions.\nOnce the stock tank conditions are specified, the volume balance of the oil, water and gas\n\n\n\n18 Chapter 2. Theoretical concepts\n\nmay be converted through the phase densities at stock-tank conditions. Taking the fact\nthat Darcy law describes flow with respect to the solid matrix Biot (1941), the macroscopic\nDarcy velocity can be written as:\n\nv?f = ?

(1 + ?v) or ? = ?\n?\n\n(1+?v)\n, it becomes\n\n?? = ?? + (Cb ? (1 + ??) Cs) Pex + (Cb ?Cs) ?? (2.35)\n\nor in terms of ? and Pex\n\n?? = ?? + ??v +\n1\nM\nPex (2.36)\n\n\n\n2.2. Poroelastic formulation 21\n\nwhere the M is Biot\u2019s constant defined as\n\n1\nM\n\n= (1 ??) (????)Cb (2.37)\n\nCb and Cs are respectively the bulk compressibility and solid grain compressibility, they\nare related to Kb and Ks by\n\nCb = 1Kb\nCs = 1Ks\n\n(2.38)\n\nif M > 0 ? lies within the following bounds\n\n?? ? ? ? 1 (2.39)\n\nif the solid material is incompressible, Cs = 0 and ? = 1 or ? = ?? then 1M = 0. Finally,\na low advective velocity is imposed on the coupled mass balance equation\n\n?(???f)\n?t\n\n?\nvsolid \u00b7?(???f ), that is\n\nD(???f )\nDt\n\n?\n?(???f )\n?t\n\n(2.40)\n\nThe physical interpretation of this approximation is that the medium is undergoing de-\nformation but remains stationary. Thus the multiphase flow equation 2.28 coupled with\ngeomechanics can finally be written as\n\n?(?f\n(\n?? + ??\u00b7 u + 1M P\n\nex\n)\n)\n\n?t\n+ ?\u00b7 v?mf = qf (2.41)\n\nwith ?? replaced by equation 2.36. However, in rock mechanics analysis, it is standard to\nwrite the coupled equations in terms of total stress and excess pore pressure as\n\n??\n?(?f )\n?t\n\n+ ?f (Cb ? (1 + ??) Cs)\n?(Pex)\n?t\n\n+ ?f (Cb ?Cs)\n?(??)\n?t\n\n+ ?\u00b7 v?mf = qf (2.42)\n\nThe above derivation is based on volume variations, including bulk volume, pore volume\nand porosity variations. As a result, displacements or stresses explicitly show up in the\ncontinuity equations.\nAnother term that implicitly involves geomechanical effect is the transmissibility term (?\u00b7\nv?f ) through permeability changes, although rock permeability is generally considered to\nremain constant in standard reservoir simulations. Permeability-stress coupling, however,\nis not a direct coupling as in pore volume. It is usually conducted in a stepped manner.\nOne simple approach is to assume that permeability depends on porosity as, for example,\naccording to the Garman-Kozeny relation commonly used in basin simulators. Other\n\n\n\n22 Chapter 2. Theoretical concepts\n\nstress-dependent permeability models may also be used, e.g. Morita (1992). Here, it is\npointed out that pore volume coupling is the primary interest of this work. Permeability-\nstress coupling and non-linear relations of fluid properties by dependence of pressure are\nproposed as future works.\nIn summary the mathematical description for coupling porous flow and geomechanics must\naccount for the following important characteristics of the reservoir system (Osorio, 1992):\n\n1. The multi-component nature of the reservoirs require descriptions for both the pore\npressure of fluids and the solid components, so mass and force conservation laws\nand constitutive relations, which represent the coupling effects must be combined\nto obtain the fully coupled equations.\n\n2. Pressure depletion, which occurs inside the reservoir induces an extended stress-\ndisturbed region outside the reservoir boundaries. The disturbed region affects the\nevolution of the stress at the reservoir boundaries. The geomechanical interaction\nbetween boundaries and stress state inside the reservoir is a fully coupled process.\nThis indicates that the inclusion of a surrounding environment (over burden, under\nburden and side burden) is necessary to achieve a realistic modeling of the actual\ngeomechanical boundary conditions. Indeed the surrounding domain needs to be\nextensive enough to ensure that its boundaries are not perturbed by reservoir pro-\nduction or injections during the time period of interest.\n\n2.2.4 Strong formulation\nReturning to the formulation, the coupled mass balance and force equations are written\nas:\n\n?\n?t\n\n(?f (?? + ? (?\u00b7 u ??\u00b7 u?) + S? (Pex ?Pex? ))) + ?\u00b7?fv?f = qf (2.43)\n\nwhere S? = 1M , and\n\nv?f = ???

It can be separated into\n??diffusion and ??elasticity:\n\n??elasticity = ??u + ???t\n??diffusion = ??pex + ??q\n\n(2.50)\n\nwhere ??u is the displacement boundary, ???t is the total stress or traction boundary, ??P\nis the excess pore pressure boundary, and ??q is the fluid flux boundary. The displacement\nboundary condition is\n\nu = u on ??u (2.51)\nwhere u is the prescribed displacement on surface. The total stress or traction boundary\ncondition on ???t is:\n\n?t \u00b7 n = t on ???t (2.52)\n\n\n\n24 Chapter 2.

The fluid flux boundary\ncondition is:\n\n?\n(\n?\n?\n?\u00b7Pex\n\n)\n\u00b7 n = q on ??q (2.54)\n\nwhere q denotes the prescribed flow normal to surface ??q.\nInitial conditions are given in terms of pressure and total stress by:\n\nPex = Pex0 on ? at t = 0\n?t = ?t 0 on ? at t = 0\n\n(2.55)\n\n2.2.5 Dimensionless Strong Formulation\n\nIn this section dimensionless forms of poroelasticity are presented to exploit and obtain\nmore general results in the following sections.\n\nDimensionless Analysis by Using the Pi Theorem\n\nThe Buckingham ? theorem is key in dimensional analysis. It is the formalization of\nRayleigh\u2019s method of dimensional analysis. The theorem states that if we have a physi-\ncally meaningful equation involving a certain number n of physical variables, and these\nvariables are expressible in terms of k independent fundamental physical quantities, then\nthe original expression is equivalent to an equation involving a set of r = n ? k dimen-\nsionless parameters constructed from the original variables: rewriting the equations in a\nnon-dimensional form. It provides a method for computing sets of dimensionless parame-\nters from the given variables, even if the form of the equation is still unknown. However,\nthe choice of dimensionless parameters is not unique, Buckingham\u2019s theorem only pro-\nvides a way of generating sets of dimensionless parameters, and will not choose the most\nphysically meaningful set (Wong, 1990). Combined with inspection analysis this proce-\ndure allows the choice of important quantities that represent the fundamental behavior\nof one phenomenon.\nUsing the procedure in Wong (1990), the poroelastic coupled system described by (2.48)\nwith boundary and initial conditions: (2.51), (2.52), (2.53), (2.54), (2.55), are transformed\n\n\n\n2.2.

Normally, single-phase systems are used in well test analysis where inspection\nanalysis enables the transformation into dimensionless space for any given set of given\nboundary conditions. For two-phase systems, Lake (1990) presents a general method to\nscale flow through heterogeneous permeable media for an immiscible displacement of oil\nby water in a two-dimensional, anisotropic, heterogeneous cross section with statistically\nstationary properties. Gharbi (2002) established a foundation for scaling miscible dis-\nplacement in three-dimensional reservoirs. These examples illustrate how dimensional\nforms allow the understanding of essential mechanisms and present the results in a com-\npact form.\n\n2.3 Fault Reactivation according to the inclusion the-\nory\n\nGeological discontinuities such as faults are inherent in most petroleum formations. There\nare a number of human activities, such as hydrocarbon production, that can sufficiently\n\n\n\n2.3. Fault Reactivation according to the inclusion theory 27\n\nalter the in-situ stresses within a period of a few years or even a few months resulting\nin reactivation and slip of the nearby faults (Hawkes, 2009). Fault reactivation due to\nreservoir depletion may have various consequences ranging from shearing boreholes drilled\nto inducing seismicity on faulted zones. Stress state perturbation resulting from subsur-\nface fluid extraction clearly and robustly demonstrates the importance of considering the\nporoelastic effect. The increasing number of induced seismicity and well damages initiated\ngreat interest in studying the mechanics of fault reactivation, ground subsidence, reservoir\ndeformation, and in-situ stress changes caused by fluid withdrawal (Germanovich, 2004).\nIn most cases the reservoir has been treated as a partially drained poroelastic inclusion\nsurrounded by an elastic host material. Usually to solve this problem in the literature,\nthree approaches can be considered:\n\n1. The reservoir is modelled by an inclusion with a rather arbitrary pore pressure\ndistribution but with the same material properties as the surrounding rock matrix.\n\n2. The reservoir is modelled as a uniformly pressurized homogeneous ellipsoidal inclu-\nsion with different material properties compared to the surrounding rock.\n\n3. Numerical approximations as: finite difference, finite elements, or boundary ele-\nments procedures, are used to model the phenomenon.\n\nThe first approach is based on a homogeneous formation and accounts for the main reason\nfor stress redistribution around depleted reservoirs, i.e., a change in the reservoir pore\npressure. The second approach, utilizing an ellipsoidal inclusion, accounts for another\nimportant factor of material inhomogeneity, but considers uniform pressure distribution\ninside the reservoir.\nThe third approach, used in this work, is relatively flexible, but when modeling large\ndomains with complex geometries, unreliable solutions can be obtained if conventional\nnumeric techniques are used. In addition, with numerical modeling, it is possible to cal-\nculate different material contrast and different production programs. Using the suggested\nimplementation, the challenge is to obtain a reasonable approximation without extreme\nrefinements and large simulations times.\n\n2.3.1 Main assumptions\n\nThe following simplifying assumptions are made for the semi-analytical approach given\nin Hawkes (2009) and Germanovich (2004):\n\n1. Plane strain conditions. This means the third normal stress is expressed as function\nof the other ones and pore pressure excess.\n\n\n\n28 Chapter 2. Theoretical concepts\n\n2. The reservoir can interact with the earth surface, having the same elastic moduli as\nside burden rocks.\n\n3. Side burden rocks are under the drained limit.\n\n4. Linear poroelastic behavior of reservoir and side burden rocks.\n\n5. The initial in-situ stress state is known.\n\n6. Ideal cohesion on the reservoir boundaries.\n\n7. Fault gouge obeys the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion.\n\n8. Thin pre-existing faults. Mechanically, faults don\u2019t exist, they represent potential\nslip surfaces.\n\nNote that, before the onset of slip, the presence of the fault does not affect the stress\nstate around the reservoir. In this respect, mechanically, the fault does not exist before\nthe slip initiates and only represents a potential slip surface rather than a displacement\ndiscontinuity affecting the state of stress.\n\n2.3.2 Theoretical concepts\nAn inclusion is defined as a sub-domain ? in domain D, where the arbitrary strains\nreferred as eigenstrain ?? (x) (Mura, 1982; Hawkes, 2009) is given in ? and is zero in\nD??, this strain field can be thought as internal strains that would be caused by different\nmechanisms, including poroelastic, poroelastoplastic and thermal changes in a unbounded\nbody free of external forces and surface constrains. The elastic moduli in ? and D?? are\nthe same, assumption (2). The remaining domain D ? ? is called the elastic matrix. In\nhis well-known papers on this subject, Eshelby (1957) showed that the inclusion problem\nis equivalent to solving equations of elastic equilibrium for a homogeneous body with a\nknown body force distribution. For such bodies, the equations of elastic equilibrium are\nsolved using the elastic static Green functions (Mura, 1982).\nThe Green function G (x, x?) gives the magnitude of the displacement in the xi direction\nat point x when a unit body force in the xj direction is applied at point x? to an elastic\nmedium under plane strain conditions into half space assumption (1), (2), (3) and (4).\nIn the Green function method, the displacement u and stress field ? due to eigenstrain\n?? (x) in the inclusion is given as:\n\nu =\n?\n?\n\nCjlmn?\n?\nmn (x\n\n?) Gij,l (x ? x?) dx? (2.67)\n\n\n\n2.3. Fault Reactivation according to the inclusion theory 29\n\n? = ?\n1\n2\n\n?\n?\n\nCjlmn?\n?\nmn (x\n\n?){Gik,lj (x ? x?) + Gjk,li (x ? x?)}dx? (2.68)\n\n? (x) = ?Cijkl\n\n??\n?\n?\n?\n\nCpqmn?\n?\nmn (x\n\n?) Gkp,ql (x ? x?) dx? + ??kl (x\n?)\n??\n? (2.69)\n\nwhere ?? (x) = 0 for x ? D ? ?, Cjikl = ??ij?kl + \u00b5 (?ik?jl + ?il?jk).\nSince ?? (x) is discontinuous on the boundary of the inclusion ??, some quantities may\nalso be discontinuous on the boundary. However the displacement and the inter-facial\ntractions across the boundary must be continuous, i.e. assumption (6) that is:\n\n?u?? = uout ? uin (2.70)\n\n???? \u00b7 n = {?out ??in} \u00b7 n (2.71)\nEshelby (1957) showed that, for an ellipsoidal inclusion in a full-space, the strain and\nstress field are uniform for all interior points. In the case of dilatational eigenstrain (i.e.,\nthe tendency of the inclusion would be to expand or contract isotropically, as would be\nthe case for poroelastic or thermoelastic strains in an isotropic medium), ?? (x) = ?C (x) I,\nwith I representing the identity matrix, thus equations 2.67, 2.68 and 2.69 are reduced\nto:\n\nu (x) = ?(2\u00b5 + 3?)\n?\n\n?\n\n?C (x?) GDi (x, x\n?) dx? (2.72)\n\n? (x) = ?\n1\n2\n\n(2\u00b5 + 3?)\n?\n\n?\n\n?C (x?){Gik,lj (x ? x?) + Gjk,li (x ? x?)}dx? (2.73)\n\n? (x) = ?(2\u00b5 + 3?)\n?\n?\n\n?C (x?) GSij (x, x\n?) dx? + ?? (x?) (2.74)\n\nwhere ?? (x) = (2\u00b5 + 3?) ?ij?C (x) is the eigenstress at point x, and GDi (x, x?) = Gij,l (x ? x?)\nand GSij (x, x?) = \u00b5 (Gip,pj (x ? x?) + Gjp,pi (x ? x?)) + ? (Gkp,pk (x ? x?)) ?ij respectively,\nare influence and stress functions for dilatation (Segall, 1987; Hawkes, 2009).\nIt is possible to consider a reservoir as an inclusion if it has the same material properties\nas the surrounding rock, and the eigenstrains are defined as the dilatational strains that\nwould be caused by changes in pore pressure excess ?Pex or temperature ?T inside the\nreservoir if it was unbounded. The values of dilatational eigenstrain for these conditions,\nrespectively, are:\n\n?C (x) =\n1\n3\n\n(\n??Pex (x)\n\nKu\n\n)\n=\n??Pex (x)\n(2\u00b5 + 3?)\n\n(2.75)\n\n\n\n30 Chapter 2. Theoretical concepts\n\n?C (x) = ??T (x) (2.76)\n\nwhere Ku is the undrained bulk modulus and ? is the linear coefficient of thermal expan-\nsion.\nThe treatment of a reservoir as an inclusion also requires the assumption that no pressure\nor temperature change occurs in the surrounding rocks; i.e., there is no hydraulically\ndriven flow, no heat transfer, and fully drained loading occurs. Inclusion theory allows\nthe consideration of reservoirs of arbitrary shape. A useful result of the treatment of\nthe dimensionless equations is the possibility to use LPA in linear thermal stress calcu-\nlations, since in the dimensionless form of poroelastic and thermoelastic equations are\nmathematically equal.\n\n2.3.3 Assessment of fault reactivation\n\nStress arching ratios\n\nThe ratio of the change in total stress to the change in pore pressure within the reservoir\nhas been referred to as the stress arching ratio. Normalized stress arching ratios are\ndefined by Hawkes (2009) and are slightly more generalized for poroelastic analysis, since\nthey results from the stresses and homogeneous excess pore pressure change combination,\nand are expressed as follows:\n\n? =\n??\n\n??Pex\n(2.77)\n\nwhen ? and ?Pex are defined ? is directly determine using 2.77.\n\nCoulomb failure stress change ?CFS\n\nThe Coulomb Failure Stress (CFS) is defined as follows :\n\nCFS = ? ?\u00b5s?n (2.78)\n\nwhere ? and ?n respectively are, shear and effective normal stress on the fault plane,\n\u00b5s is the coefficient of friction in the fault plane (i.e., the tangent of the fault friction\nangle normally between 0.4 &lt;\u00b5s &lt;0.8 for several brittle rocks (Hawkes, 2009)). A fault\nplane is activated when CFS is equal to or greater than zero. In a production or injection\nscenario, where in stress changes have been induced, the change in CFS is:\n\n?CFS = ?? ?\u00b5s??n (2.79)\n\n\n\n2.3. Fault Reactivation according to the inclusion theory 31\n\nThe sign of ?? is positive when it points in the same direction as the initial shear stress\non the plane. The sign of ??n is negative for an increase in compressive stress. As such,\na positive ?CFS indicates a tendency towards fault reactivation. Earthquake-induced\n?CFS values as small as 0.1 MPa have been found to induce seismic activity in faulted\nsettings evidencing fault reactivation where initial CFS values are close to zero (Segall,\n1992; Guyoton and Volant, 1992; Rudnicki, 1999; Ferronato, 2008; Hawkes, 2009). In\norder to achieve a more general, dimensionless characterization of fault reactivation risk,\na parameter called fault reactivation factor Hawkes (2009) is defined here as follows:\n\n?FR =\n?CFS\n??Pex\n\n=\n??\n\n??Pex\n?\u00b5s\n\n??n\n??Pex\n\n=\n??shear\n??Pex\n\n?\u00b5s\n??n\n??Pex\n\n(2.80)\n\nFault Reactivation calculations\n\nFollowing Hawkes (2009), effective stress changes or normalized stress arching ratios can\nbe calculated as follow:\n\n\u2022 Given a ?Pex calculate ? using the equation 2.74.\n\n\u2022 Calculate ? and ?FR over a fault plane (straight lines in this work) by applying a\nstress rotation over required angles.\n\n\u2022 Using the sing of ?FR convention, evaluate which planes are reactivated.\n\nTo define fault reactivation calculation, it is necessary to solve the normal and shear stress\nor arching ratios along fault plane inclined ? degrees counter-clockwise from x axis, then\ncalculate ?FR or ?CFS to define the tendency to reactivate. The reactivation is given\nfor the sign convention in table 2.2\n\nTable 2.2: Fault reactivation tendency sign convention. Opposite case tendency to sta-\nbilization.

Theoretical concepts\n\n2.4 Summary\n\nIn this chapter, a displacement-pressure (also called u-p formulation) mono phasic and\ndimensionless poroelastic formulation was presented. The basic assumptions and consti-\ntutive relations of the continuum theory were described. The governing equations consist\nof the balance of mass equations and the balance of momentum equations for each phase.\nDetailed derivations of these governing equations were presented. The equations finally\nbecame a mono phasic poroelastic system used for subsequent analyses. Also, mathemati-\ncal approximation of fault reactivation is given by means of inclusion theory, a formulation\nthat is going to be used in chapter 5 to compare against LAP calculations.\n\n\n\n3.

Thus, the iterative process is reduced to\nupdate the global load vector (3.74) as the product between the solution vector at time\nn and the global mass matrix, plus the constant load vector representing the mass flux\nand the body forces (right term in (3.74)), and finally by multiplying by the inverse of\nthe stiffness matrix, the solution vector at time n + ? is obtained.

The discrete form of the equations rep-\nresents a set of ordinary differential equations in time. Finite differences were used to\napproximate the temporal variable in an implicit matrix and fully coupled formulation\nwith different time schemes.\n\n\n\n4. Implementation and validation\n\n4.1 Implementation\n\nThe finite element method was selected to implement the formulation represented by the\nmatrix systems 3.73 and 3.74. One of its capabilities is modeling complex geometries and\nusing different polynomial orders to approximate the state variables. However, the use\nof this technique represents relative complex challenges from the computational point of\nview. This complexity is related to integral calculations, boundary conditions, the need\nto use different polynomial orders and different elements types in the same computational\nmesh. It is possible to overcome these computational complexities by using object oriented\nprogramming. In object oriented programming, data processing is given by the interaction\nof objects that can compute and interchange data to solve one specific problem.\nIn an object oriented environment, classes represent entities describing data and set of\nactions for designing applications and computer programs. When one set of data is\ndetermined, the actions to be executed over this set are determined only under the class\nrules. The use of classes is reflected through objects generated from them; thus one object\ncan be viewed as an independent machine with a distinct role or responsibility. When one\nobject is generated its actions (or methods) on data are closely associated with it. Thus\ninstead of programming one set of routines to solve a problem, it is possible to generate\nobjects that interact between them to solve the same problem.\nThe cornerstone of object oriented programming is the reuse of classes already developed\nand tested in different problems. This favors the quick development of new functionalities\nof an existing system to solve another type of problem, since the programmer is focused on\nimplementing the needed code without thinking about all the possible modifications. It\ndecreases the possibilities of errors that can alter the normal functionality of the system.\nIn object oriented environments to solve partial differential equations with finite elements;\nmatrices, vectors, solvers, nodes, geometric and computational elements are treated as\nobjects that interact under several rules. This implementation, LPA, was developed using\nthe NeoPZ environment Devloo (2009) and new classes were implemented to solve the\nformulation in question.\n\n45\n\n\n\n46 Chapter 4. Implementation and validation\n\nNeoPZ description\n\nNeoPZ environment is an object oriented C++ library for the development of finite el-\nement programs (Devloo, 2009), maintained by the LabMeC staff at Unicamp and ac-\ncessible from Google Code. The main characteristic of the NeoPZ environment is the\nstrong separation between geometry modelling, definition of the interpolation space and\ndefinition of the variational statement used to approximate the physical problem. This\napproach offers user a generic environment where the re-usability of implemented finite\nelement algorithms is maximized, for instance:\n\n\u2022 One dimensional geometric element which uses a mapping in cylindrical coordinates\nis implemented . Using this, rings or helicoidal springs can be approximated without\nerror in the geometrical map.\n\n\u2022 Hierarchical shape functions have been defined for the computational elements. Con-\nsequently, all finite element approximations using NeoPZ can make use of high order\ninterpolation functions, independently of the underlying variational statement.\n\n\u2022 H-adaptivity has been implemented, both at the level of the geometric and computa-\ntional grid. At the computational grid level, compatibility constraints are computed\nbetween elements which have common sides at a different level. As a result, all finite\nelement models implemented in PZ can use adaptive grids.\n\n\u2022 Any new model, represented by some partial differential equation can be introduced\nby adding a class derived from the TPZMaterial class. After the variational state-\nment has been implemented, it can be approximated by C0 finite elements of any\ninterpolation order, using adapted grids if desired.\n\nLPA description\n\nLinear poroelastic analysis LPA is composed of several C++ classes already implemented\nin NeoPZ (TPZGeomesh,TPZCompMesh,TPZMultiphysicsElement). In addition, the\nclass TPZPoroElastic2d was developed to compute the poroelastic contribution based\non the weak statement previously presented as well as others for geometry processing and\nanalytical functions (TPZReadGIDGrid). The LPA is based on three principal classes\nTPZGeomesh, TPZCompMesh and TPZPoroElastic2d, which involve finite element com-\nputations. Operations like generation of geometries, matrix and solution calculations are\nconsidered out of these classes, since they are not an essential part of finite elements\nprocedures.\nThe main program can be described by several steps as follows:\n\nhttp://www.labmec.org.br/wiki/index.php\nhttp://code.google.com/p/neopz/\n\n\n4.1. Implementation 47\n\n\u2022 Generate the geometry that represents the description of nodes, elements and ma-\nterials identifiers.\n\n\u2022 Using the geometric information two computational meshes are created one for\nelasticity, another for the diffusion problem.\n\n\u2022 Based on these meshes, the Poroelastic mesh (overlapping of diffusive and elastic\ndomains is generated (see Figure 4.2), by using the class TPZPoroElastic2d.\n\n\u2022 Compute the contribution for each computational element and assemble the global\nstiffness and load vector\n\n\u2022 Do time calculations and print the required data at each time.\n\nTPZGeomesh\nThe class TPZGeomesh implements a geometric mesh for the NeoPZ environment. It\nprovides services for description of geometric elements: one, two and three-dimensional\nelements can be used. Several classes derived from TPZGeomesh are used to store the\nnecessary data in the geometric information such as nodes, elements, material identifiers\nas well as node coordinates, elements sides and jacobean calculations for isoparametric\nelements. All this information is needed to compute global stiffness and load vector arrays.\n\nTPZCompMesh\nThe class TPZPoroElastic2d defines the interpolation space and the integration over each\nelement. It has the information required to compute the stiffness and load vector arrays\nfor each boundary and domain elements. The computational mesh is like a repository of\ncomputational elements, nodes and material objects that define the way the calculations\nare done. In this work the class TPZPoroElastic2d controls how to compute the contribu-\ntion over each computational element. TPZCompMesh also contains the current solution\nof the mesh and an element wise solution vector.\n\nTPZPoroElastic2d\nThe class TPZPoroElastic2d is the most important in LPA computations because it rep-\nresents the mathematical description of the poroelastic problem defined previously, and\nin particular it contains one method called contribute that represents the weak statement\nand how the poroelastic contributions of each elements are done. Detailed description of\nthis method is given in the appendix B.1. Algorithms 1, 2, 3 and 4 explain the code lines\n\n\n\n48 Chapter 4. Implementation and validation\n\nof contribute method and their relationships with the mathematical expressions developed\nin chapter 3.\nIn TPZPoroElastic2d the element contributions are computed using basis and weight\nfunctions and their corresponding derivatives according to the bilinear forms given in\nchapter 3. This basis and weight functions values are provided for the computational\nmesh into TPZCompMesh class. Figure 4.1 represents how the element information is\nprocessed between the objects generated by each class.\n\nFigure 4.1: Schematic flow of data computations and class interactions.\n\nTPZGeoMesh\n\nTPZPoroElastic2d\n\nTPZAnalysis\n\nSolve system\n\nAssemble\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n6\n\n4\n\nDo Jacobian calculations to computational \n\nelements in order to obtain the transformations to \n\nCartesian coordinates.\n\nRepresent test functions values and their \n\nderivatives to TPZPoroelastic2d calculates the \n\nContributions.\n\nReturn the values in each integration point to  \n\ncreate local elements matrices and vectors\n\nExecute 1, 3 and 2 for  each computational \n\nelement presented in TPZCompMesh\n\nReturn the Global Stiffness Matrix and Load \n\nVectors to solve the system\n\n1\n\nSolve the system at each time\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nMultiphysics point of view\nThe concept of multi-physics simulations into NeoPZ is very different from other known\nfinite element implementations. Multiphysics meshes and classes have been validated on\napproximations using HDiv flux-pressure interaction. In this work, coupled flow through\nporous media modeled by linear poroelasticity is validated, contributing to NeoPZ\u2019s mul-\ntiphysics branch. In a general form a multiphysic mesh is composed of the information\ngiven in each material domain that represents one specific state variable. Thus it is nec-\nessary to define different domains with geometric information to calculate the respective\nbasis and weight functions presented in the finite element formulations. Figure 4.2 shows\n\n\n\n4.1. Implementation 49\n\nhow it is possible to define different domains and to compose the poroelastic domain (red\ndomain) embedded in an elastic matrix with conforming meshes.\n\nFigure 4.2: Embedded domain by overlapping areas. Left) Diffusion domain that contains\nall geometric information and computational information for flow calculations, Right)\nElastic domain that contains all geometric information and computational information\nfor elasticity.\n\nIn finite element approximations of systems of partial differential equations, it is cus-\ntomary to associate the same weight function to each state variable. For instance, in\ntwo-dimensional elasticity the same weight function is associated with the horizontal and\nvertical displacements. In most of finite element approximations, the number of state\nvariables associated with each shape function is constant. In these cases, the number of\nstate variables can be a value associated with geometric meshes. In multiphysics prob-\nlems, the number of state variables can vary according to the physical quantity being\nrepresented. For instance, in numerical approximations of flow through porous media,\ntwo (or three) state variables are associated with the shape functions which approximate\nthe displacements of the porous matrix and a single shape function is associated with\nthe pressure variable. In NeoPZ there exists one entity that contains the information\nabout the shape functions called connect. Each connect keeps track of the number of\nstate variables associated with its weight function and consequently it is used to model\nporoelastic inclusions, by combining the geometric information for each weight function\nin each domain intersection, i.e. one computational mesh can be viewed as an indepen-\ndent 2D plane of information that combine the multiphysics classes (see Figure 4.3 ) with\nother computational domains, as TPZPoroElastic2d that merges the intersecting meshes\ninformation, following mathematical statements of linear poroelasticity.\nAlso it is very important to point out that once the variational statement of a multi-\nphysic problem, for example thermo-poroelasticity,is defined, it can implemented via the\nprocedure explained in appendix B. Figure 4.3 represents the associated basis and weight\n\n\n\n50 Chapter 4.

All the information of each\ncomputational element that represent one physical problem is stored and processed by\nmultiphysics elements as the poroelastic elements represented by TPZPoroElastic2d.

GID is\na universal, adaptive and user-friendly pre and post-processor for numerical simulation\nin science and engineering. It has been designed to cover all the common needs in the\nnumerical simulations field from pre to post-processing: geometrical modeling, effective\ndefinition of analysis data, meshing, data transfer to analysis software, as well as the\nvisualization of numerical results. It was chosen for preprocessing the geometry, because\n\nhttp://www.gidhome.com/support/tutorials \n\n\n4.1. Implementation 51\n\nit can be easily adapted to the problem requirements. For LPA geometric input a cus-\ntomized material template was defined in order to associate the material identifiers with\nthe geometric elements (Algorithm 5).\nGeometry generation can be done by command line or graphical user interface (GUI). For\nthe quick generation of meshes, the GUI method is preferred, but to generate a model\nfor parametric analysis the command line is preferred. Basically, geometry generation is\ndivided into four steps:\n\n\u2022 Open a new project, then select a problem and type ansys55plane, by following\nMenu / Data / Problem Type / ansys55 / ansys55plane.\n\n\u2022 Save under any name and close the program.\n\n\u2022 In the folder of the GID project, replace the content of the *.mat file by Algorithm\n5.\n\n\u2022 Open the project and generate your own geometry associating the materials identi-\nfiers.\n\nFinally once the geometry is generated, it is exported to a *.dump file that contains all\nthe information of the geometric mesh and the associated materials.\n\nFigure 4.4: Geometry generated in GID and its corresponding geometric mesh.\n\nXml control file\nExtensible Language (XML) is a set of rules for encoding documents in machine readable\nform. XML is a popular format for sharing data on internet. Websites that frequently\nupdate their content, such as news sites or blogs, often provide an XML feed so that\nexternal programs can keep abreast of content changes. Uploading and parsing XML\ndata is a common task for network-connected apps. TinyXML is a simple, small, C++\n\nhttp://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/\n\n\n52 Chapter 4. Implementation and validation\n\nXML parser that can be easily integrated into other programs. In brief, TinyXML parses\nan XML document, and builds from that a Document Object Model (DOM) that can\nbe read, modified, and saved. Xml files control LPA computations. All the cases and\ntests presented here have one GID *.dump and *.xml files that define the control of the\nsimulation and the simulation times to print information.\nIn summary, to implement a strong formulation using NeoPZ environment, the attention\nis concentrated on coding the corresponding weak formulation in NeoPZ code lines. Weak\nforms of linear poroelasticity were translated to NeoPZ syntax as shown in Appendix B.1.\nFigure 4.5 shows a simple work flow to generate computational models with LPA; the\ninformation is processed from the geometry created in GID and exported to *.dump\nfiles, then converted for LPA to geometric and computational meshes and the simulation\nbehavior is defined by *.xml files. The simulation results are post-processed using *.vtk\nfiles in Paraview.\n\nFigure 4.5: General work flow to solve poroelasticity equations.\n\n4.2 Computational Tests\nIn order to demonstrate the code validity, two different problems with analytical solutions\nare presented:\n\n1. Step load applied to infinite and finite columns.\n\n2. Mass source injection into a bounded infinite poroelastic medium.\n\n4.3 Step load applied to an elastic half space\nThe sudden application of a uniform surface load by permeable piston is the natural\nconsolidation problem. When a burial history occurs in a very short time relative to fluid\ndiffusion it can be modeled as a step change in vertical load as shown in Figure 4.6.\n\n\n\n4.3. Step load applied to an elastic half space 53\n\nFigure 4.6: Step load applied to a poroelastic half space. Left) Boundary conditions for\nthe poroelastic column. Geometric Mesh with associated materials identifiers (Colors),\nthe blue one (number 1) represents the poroelastic column and the others, the boundary\nconditions. Center) Mesh for finite poroelastic column, Right) Mesh for Infinite poroelas-\ntic column. Source: redraw from Wang (2000).\n\nSemi-Infinite poroelastic column\n\nInitial and boundary conditions\n\nThe problem is to find the excess pore pressure Pex(y,t) , and vertical displacement,\nu (y,t), after a uniform downward load ??t0 is suddenly applied at t = 0 on y = 0 of\na vertical infinite column that is constrained laterally for two non flux boundaries. The\nvertical load is held constant with time, and the top surface is drained Pex (0, t) = 0.\nMechanical equilibrium requires that the suddenly applied surface load ??t0 be transmit-\nted instantaneously throughout the column. This constant vertical stress at all depths\ninduces an excess pore pressure Pex = ??t0 at all depths and at different times.\n\nDimensionless expressions\n\nUsing the same procedure for dimensionless forms of poroelastic problem and inserting\nthe dimensionless groups of table 4.1 in the equations given in Wang (2000), the following\nanalysis results are obtained:\n\n\n\n54 Chapter 4.

Based on this criterion, an estimate of the time it takes for the\nsurface pressure to propagate diffusively to depth yD is given by tD =\n\ny2\nD\n\n4 .\n\nDisplacement\n\nAn infinite column length means that the initial vertical displacement at the surface\nis infinite in response to sudden application of the load. However the time-dependent\ndisplacements of the surface yD of the infinite column is finite and is given as.\n\nuyD (yD, tD) =\n\n?\n???2\n?\ntDe\n\n?\ny2\nD\n\n4tD\n?\n?\n\n?yD erfc\n(\n\nyD\n2\n?\ntD\n\n)???? 1y (4.2)\n\nDarcy velocity\n\nvyD (yD, tD) = ?\ne\n?\nz2\nD\n\n4tD\n?\n?\n?\ntD\n\n1y (4.3)\n\n\n\n4.3.

Normally, if an\nexplicit numeric scheme is used, the CFL must be equal to 1 to obtain convergence. The\nimplicit scheme used here is less sensitive to numerical instability and so larger values of\nCFL may be tolerated.\n\nFigure 4.13: Error norm for excess pore pressure vs different time steps with different\ntime schemes ? = {0.5, 0.6667, 1.0}.\n\nPDex with ! \" 0.5\nPDex with ! \" 0.6667\nPDex with ! \" 1.0\n\n!5.0 !4.5 !4.0 !3.5 !3.0 !2.5 !2.0\n\n!4.0\n\n!3.5\n\n!3.0\n\n!2.5\n\nLog!\"tD \"\n\nL\nog\n! # #e\n\nrr\nor\n2 $\n#\n\"1 2\n\n\n\n60 Chapter 4.

Mass source injection into a bounded infinite poroelastic medium 65\n\nFigure 4.20 shows the setup of the 2D plane quarter-domain FE-model. The problem has\n2 planes of symmetry. Heidbach (2010) uses the parameters presented in table 4.2. Initial\nconditions are assumed zero and boundary conditions are:\n\n\u2022 An injection point (red point) located at the center e.g. intersection of symmetry\nlines\n\n\u2022 Symmetry lines have non flux and null displacements in x direction for blue line and\ny direction for withe line.\n\n\u2022 Far field contour is a free normal stress and drained condition (red line).\n\nHere, a zero dimensional element is used (Point element located in corner, see Figure 4.20)\nto represent the mass line source. For this problem the dimensionless time step is small\ndue to the need to compare secondary variables, in other words, it is indispensable to have\na good match in state variables (excess pore pressure and displacements). The spatio-\ntemporal evolution of PSC was computed for long times. Heidbach (2010) computed the\nporoelastic response of Rudnicki (1986) three-dimensional solution with a homogeneous\n2D axis-symmetric FE model and solved the poroelasticity equations using a commercial\nsoftware package ABAQUS / StandardTM. Similarly, this modeling was based on a 2D\nversion of Rudnicki (1986) analytic solution under plane strain conditions, modeled with\nLPA.\nFor long times tD = 10.0, 2D solutions converge to the same PSC ratio of tangential\nstresses in 3D solutions ?\u00b5(?+2\u00b5) =\n\n?(1?2?)\n2(1??) (Heidbach, 2010). This limit is one half of the\n\nradial stress limit. Assuming a = 0.7 and ? = 0.3, the PSC ratio for long times is equal\nto 0.2 (figure 4.25).\n\nTable 4.2: Model parameters for line mass source solution (Rudnicki, 1986).

With\nincreasing distance to the injection, point excess pore pressure decreases more rapidly\nthan the stress changes. This leads to an intersection point of the pore pressure profile\nwith the ?x profile. The location of this intersection point depends on the duration\nof injection. The y direction stress changes, i.e. ?y along the x direction, even become\nslightly negative before converging towards zero with distance, this means that the induced\ntotal stress change is compressive. For two-dimensional LPA approximation, figure 4.23\nshows that the numerical results fit those values at the injection point, and diverge with\nthe increase in distance from the point source. In addition calculations in displacements\nare overestimated from xD > 1.0, since the numerical approximation uses an unbounded\nelastic to model an infinite bounded domain.

LPA was based on three principal classes that interact to solve a poroelastic\nproblem with the finite element procedures given in chapter 3. A multiphysics point of\nview was inherited from NeoPZ. LPA validation was presented in terms of 1D and 2D\ndimensional modeling and error norm charts were given for one-dimensional cases showing\nthe convergence of LPA to analytic solutions, validating the implementation.\n\n\n\n5. Fault reactivation\n\nIn this section, a series of calculations are presented to illustrate the problem of reactiva-\ntion and its corresponding numerical approximation with the suggested implementation,\nshowing several advantages over analytical approaches. Also, the effect of various param-\neters as reviewed in chapter 1 is shown.\n\n5.1 The rectangular reservoir problem\n\nFigure 5.1: Rectangular reservoir inclusion and boundary conditions.\n\nHosting Material\n\nReservoir Material\n\nConsider the rectangular reservoir presented in figure 5.1, where Ra, Rb, SBRa, SBRb,\nrepresent respectively: reservoir thickness, reservoir extension, and side burden rock di-\n\n69\n\n\n\n70 Chapter 5.

The rectangular inclusion is depleted \u00b1?Pex (e.g. ?Pex &lt;0 represents oil produc-\ntion) for all x ? ? (e.g. homogeneous excess pore pressure distribution). Mechanical\nconditions for side burden rocks are zero normal stress at surface ?n = 0, lateral bound-\nary displacements in x direction are zero, bottom boundary displacements in y direction\nare zero. The problem is to find the stress changes due to reservoir depletion with the\ncorresponding boundary conditions.\n\nComparison of LPA computations with other numerical approximation (STARS simulator)\nare given in the next section by contrasting with equation 2.74 representing the solution\ngiven in Hawkes (2009).\n\nLPA Calculations\n\nUsing the material properties given in Table 5.1 and ?Pex &lt;0 (e.g. depletion) and\nthe computational mesh presented in figure 5.2, the calculations of ? due to poroelastic\ninclusion (blue color) are compared with results obtained using STARS.\n\nFigure 5.2: Rectangular reservoir geometric mesh.\n\n\n\n5.1.

Figure\n5.3 shows the calculations given in this section (dotted lines) compared with calculations\nincluding an arbitrary initial state, by subtracting this initial state from the current solu-\ntion at one specific time t, the same response is obtained, assuming zero initial conditions\nat the same specific time; i.e. the initial state is important to place the problem in a\nspecific physic situation, but the stress and excess pore pressure changes determine the\nessential part of the reactivation in linear analysis. It is clear that for non-linear formula-\ntions and no static initial conditions, this is not possible. Nevertheless, following equation\n2.79, the sign ? depends on the faulting regime acting on (e.g. normal faulting or reverse\nfaulting stress regimes) the initial condition (Hawkes, 2009).\n\nFigure 5.3: Arching ratios obtained from arbitrary initial state compared with the zero\ninitial state calculations.

From equation 2.77, please note that zero contour represents the change of sign\nin stress and, following the conventional sign in continuum mechanics, compression is\nnegative, so the positive values of ? in this contours represents compression since ?Pex &lt;0\nas in Hawkes (2009).\n\nFigure 5.4: Horizontal arching ratio for rectangular reservoir computed with LPA.

(Calgary, AB, Canada) and used extensively by the petroleum industry\nworldwide. The fluid flow model is a multiphase, multicomponent reactive flow, that can\nsimulate the injection and flow of gases, solvents, polymers, surfactants, and other chem-\nicals. It can be run isothermally or not. The geomechanics module can simulate linear\nand non-linear elasticity, elastoplasticity and viscoleasticity behavior, as well fracturing\neffects.\nThe geometric mesh is composed of 301 cells in j direction and 321 cells in k direction with\ndifferent cell dimensions near the reservoir. Please note that for this model, discussion\nabout dimension are irrelevant since spatial data is scaled for comparison purposes. Thus,\nthe relation between reservoir thickness - extension and its depth must be the same for\ncomparison purposes.\nIn this example, there is one well producing from the centre of the reservoir during a\ngiven time and after this period, it is shut-in until a homogeneous excess pore pressure\ndistribution is obtained. This final step is used to calculated the stress changes. Figure\n5.7 shows the contours of ?x that have the same shape that the contours in figure 5.4. Is\nimportant to point out that null contour is independent of how the variables are scaled,\nsince the null contour is invariant after non-dimensionalization (i.e. the null contour\nshown in figure 5.4 has exactly the same shape of ?x = 0 shown in figure 5.7).\nSince the solution in Hawkes (2009) is in dimensionless forms, ? computed by STARS is\n\n\n\n74 Chapter 5. Fault reactivation\n\nnormalized with (1?2?)\n??Pex(1??) to obtain the same values. Permeabilities and fluid viscosities\n\nused in STARS are arbitrary, because a stationary solution at a determinate time (ho-\nmogeneous change in pressure), after shut-in time, is obtained. Hence, elastic parameters\nand Biot\u2019s coefficient are required be the same. In addition, it is necessary to disable\nthermal and plastic calculations in STARS to compute a pure linear elastic response.\nData generate by STARS are computed on center points and middle point between cells\nfaces. This data is smoothed with CMG post-processing tool (Results 3D) and used to\nplot figures 5.9 and 5.8.\n\nFigure 5.7: ?x contour for rectangular reservoir geometry using STARS. Visualization\nwith Results 3D.\n\nFigure 5.8 shows ?x and ?y along plot line ((0,0),(0,-2.0)) with coordinates associated with\nfigure 5.1. STARS results and LPA calculations fit Hawkes (2009) curves out of reservoir\ndomain. However, STARS model is imprecise near to reservoir boundary (see figure 5.9)\nindicating that it is necessary to apply local refinement in this region as is illustrated in\nfigure 5.2 for LPA geometric mesh.\nUnfortunately STARS cannot use its mesh refinement tools when the geomechanics module\nis used. The natural way to improve the solution is to create a new grid with local\nrefinement, increasing the number of DOF. On the other hand, LPA fits the curves, in\nand out reservoir domain.\nFor these models, the computational times do not exceed 3 minutes showing the accurate\ncomputations of LPA in comparison with commercial software STARS in terms of linear\nporoelasticity and mono-phasic flow. This example illustrates the validation of LPA in\ncomparison with a commercial tool, modelling a rectangular reservoir as a poroelastic\ninclusion. Also, it is important to note that STARS is able to simulate more sophisticated\nand complex fluid flow models than hydromechanics problems.\n\n\n\n5.1.

Fault reactivation\n\nFigure 5.12: ?FR along reservoir extension. ?FR normalized by (1?2?)(1??) , (?FR &lt;0 tendency\nto reactivate).\n\nThe fault reactivation tendency analysis is based on mapping the null contour ?FR = 0,\nsince it represents the change in compression and tension stress state. Using the Table\n2.2, any fault inclined at 60 degrees that is crossed by the null contour has a tendency to\nreactivate for negative values of ?FR, and a tendency to stabilize for positive values ?FR,\nwhen normal fault regime is assumed.\n\n5.1.1 Fault reactivation threshold\nInduced earthquake ?CFS module as 0.1 MPa have been found to induce seismic activity\nin faulting settings where initial ?CFS values are close to zero (Segall, 1992; Guyoton\nand Volant, 1992; Rudnicki, 1999; Ferronato, 2008; Hawkes, 2009). If this value is assumed\nto be consistent with fault gouge in this example, it is possible to define a threshold value\n?FRt = ?CFSt??pex =\n\n0.1\n??pex , and all negative values over this threshold strictly represent a\n\nstrong tendency to reactivate. Thus, using ? = 0.8 and ?Pex = ?10 MPa, is equivalent\nto ?FRt = ?0.0125, and it can be interpreted in previously results as follows:\n\n\u2022 Figure 5.10 shows that faults at far offsets, despite having negative values, the\ntendency to reactivate is null.\n\n\u2022 Figure 5.11 shows that fault at offset 0 tends to reactivate at depths equivalent to\nthe left reservoir flank.\n\n\n\n5.1. The rectangular reservoir problem 79\n\n\u2022 Figure 5.12 shows that any plane inclined 60 degrees crossing the reservoir reacti-\nvates along all reservoir extension. Consequently, the fault at offset 1 has a strong\ntendency in localized parts because it crosses the reservoir on the right flank.\n\n5.1.2 Side burden dimensions\n\nAnother important question at this point is: which is the optimal size of the hosting\nmaterial in order to avoid boundary effects?. According with Osorio (1992) it is important\nto minimize boundary effects is important in reservoir geomechanics modeling. This\nreduces the computational cost and makes reasonable solutions in regions possible near\nthe reservoir rocks. Figure 5.13 shows dimensionless displacements computed with 2.72\nfor side burden rocks along depth and extensions. Displacements tend to zero but never\nreach this value for infinite behavior.\n\nTable 5.2: Spatial ratios for different side burden dimensions with ? ? 0.3.\n\nRatio Ra\nSBRa\n\nRb\nRSBRb\n\nLine\nCase1 140\n\n1\n4 Red\n\nCase2 150\n1\n6 Green\n\nCase3 1100\n1\n5 Orange\n\nCase4 1100\n1\n10 Blue\n\nCase5 1200\n1\n20 Brown\n\nReference 1400\n1\n40 Black\n\nTo illustrate the effect of boundaries, a reference model (Black line fitting Hawkes (2009)\nsolution, figure 5.14) was used to evaluate differences between several hosting material\ndimensions presented in table 5.2. Based on figure 5.15 and table 5.2 the choice of case\n5 has small errors (error was not quantified) in comparison with the reference model,\nbut for practical modelling with the combination of case 2 with case 4, it is possible to\ncapture infinite behavior with Ra\n\nSBRa\n&lt;150 ,\n\nRb\nSBRb\n\n&lt;110 . Thus, for a region defined by one\nrectangle with dimensions Ra and Rb, and hosting material with ? ? 0.3, it is modeled\nwith small errors in displacements since ? is a secondary variable in LPA computations.\nIf the interest is modeling regions near the reservoir, case 2 is a good option, because all\ncases in Table 5.2 were tested into reservoir domain without considerable differences in ?,\nbut for brevity results are not shown here.\n\n\n\n80 Chapter 5.

Figure 5.16 shows the effect of \u00b5s variation\nin the null contour, showing that for rectangular case there is no significant effect for faults\ninclined 60 degrees.\n\nFigure 5.16: \u00b5s friction variation effect in zero ?FR contour. Fault reactivation factor\nnormalized by (1?2?)(1??) .\n\n5.1.4 Material contrast\nMaterial contrast is an important factor. In relation to initial case with similar elastic\nmodules, two cases are presented:\n\n\u2022 Case 1: soft side burden rocks with young modulus one tenth of the base case (e.g.\n?case1 = 0.1 ??base and \u00b5case1 = 0.1 ?\u00b5base).\n\n\u2022 Case 2: rigid side burden rocks with young modulus ten times bigger (e.g. ?case2 =\n10.0 ??base, \u00b5case2 = 10.0 ?\u00b5base ).\n\nFigure 5.17 shows that, with the same set of faults, soft side burden favors fault stability,\nand rigid side burdens favor fault reactivation, having a strong effect on fault reactivation\nfactor. Please note that several negative regions are generated by soft reservoir compaction\nor contraction.\n\n\n\n5.1. The rectangular reservoir problem 83\n\nFigure 5.17: Stiffness effect on ?FR.

Reservoir with non-constant pressure distribution 85\n\n5.1.5 Tilted reservoir\n\nReservoir inclination and geometry are important since they have a strong effect in ?FR.\nFigure 5.18 shows that faults near the reservoir flanks have larger regions with tendency\nto reactivate than horizontal reservoir with the same depletion level.\n\n5.1.6 Reservoir geometry\n\nTo analyze more complicated reservoirs, accounting for more realistic geometries, through-\nout this example the effect of reservoir shape is illustrated. Figure 5.19 shows that near\nthe anticline flanks there are larger regions with tendency of reactivation in comparison\nwith rectangular shape for the same depletion level.\n\nAll these effects represent changes in ?FR null contour, but the pore pressure excess is not\nhomogeneous and constant. However, it is possible to use previous solutions to obtain a\nrough approximation when the reservoir in general has a smooth change in pore pressure,\nthus the average pore pressure can be used to calculate ? and ?FR factors. Nevertheless\noil production programs represent no constant, no homogeneous pore pressure fields and\nthey have an important effect on ?FR distributions.\n\n5.2 Reservoir with non-constant pressure distribu-\ntion\n\nIn this section, fault reactivation analysis is used for different productions schemes, in\norder to evaluate the effect of reservoir depletion (non-constant pressure distribution) on\nfault reactivation tendency.\n\n5.2.1 Reservoir depletion due to one well\n\nConstant unit rate\n\nOne well producing at constant unit rate (e.g. qD = ?1.0) is draining the reservoir at\ndifferent offsets in x direction, at a depth of one half of the reservoir thickness plus the\nreservoir top depth. All these cases use the same set of faults previously defined.\n\n\n\n86 Chapter 5.

If the well\nlocation is near the reservoir flanks, the fault in this side increases its risk of reactivation\nsince the production and stress changes are larger for this region in comparison to the\nopposite side.\nTo define which faults reactivate using ?CFSt = 0.1 MPa, Table 5.3 is used to calculate\nthe diffusivity c = 0.269757 m2/s and the excess pore pressure reference value for a\nsource line of length Lline = 1000.0 m, Pex0 =\n\nq\n?f\n\n?\n?\nLline\n\n= ?0.125 MPa. In terms of\n?FRt = ?CFStPex0 = ?0.8 MPa, this is the dimensionless threshold used to compare LPA\ncomputations based on Table 2.1.\n\nTable 5.3: Model parameters for one well production scheme.

This situation\nillustrates how it is possible to use the results for one production well at different rates\nwith different ?FRt values. For ?FRt = ?0.8 previous results can be interpreted as follows:\n\n\u2022 Figure 5.20 shows that for far and near offset faults, despite having values with\na negative trend, faults have a null tendency to reactivate at dimensionless time\ntD = 0.06 after 23 d of constant production.\n\n\u2022 Figure 5.21 shows that the fault at offset 0 does not reach the critical value of\ntD = 0.09 (after 35 d), at depths equivalent to reservoir flanks. The fault at offset\n1 reach the critical value of tD = 0.09 (after 35 d).\n\nWhen the rate is twice large, the threshold value turns to ?FRt = ?0.4, the scenario is\ndifferent for 23 d of production and there is a strong tendency to reactivate the fault at\noffset 0.\nIn the case of the production well on the left flank under the same operating conditions,\nresults can be interpreted as follows:\n\n\u2022 Figure 5.22 shows that for far and near offset faults, despite having negative values,\nfaults have a null tendency to reactivate at dimensionless time tD = 0.06 after 23 d\nof constant production. Note that for fault at offset 0, the effect of production on\nthe left side is relevant.\n\n\n\n5.2. Reservoir with non-constant pressure distribution 91\n\n\u2022 Figure 5.23 shows that the fault at offset 1 reaches the critical value for tD = 0.2\n(after 77 d) of constant production.\n\nThus it is possible to do a parametric analysis with these simulation results for different\nreservoir depths, permeabilities, fluid viscosities and well rates, as well as bhp pressures by\nsetting this condition for line sources, since all these calculations are given in dimensionless\nforms. This explains, why despite linear poroelastic problem being well know, the use\nof dimensionless forms exploits poroelastic computations for simple problems in isotropic\nand homogeneous materials, obtained by solving one specific problem (\u201cmaster problem\u201d).\nThus, it is possible to obtain different solutions with simple post-processing computations.\n\n5.2.2 Reservoir depletion due to injection-production scheme\n\nIn this section, fault reactivation is analyzed in two cases when injection and production\nexist, at the same time, as shown in Figure 5.24.\n\n\u2022 The first case is a simple unitary injection/production array on the left and right\nreservoir flanks respectively.\n\n\u2022 In second case, the reservoir is depleted by single production well during 0.05 units\nof tD, after this time, two injection wells on reservoir lateral flanks start the injection\nto maintain the reservoir pressure with one half of unitary rate (i.e. qD = ?0.5).\n\nFigure 5.24: Production strategy to analyze the effect of depletion. Left) case 1. Right)\ncase 2.\n\n\n\n92 Chapter 5. Fault reactivation\n\nCase 1\n\nTwo mass sources at unitary rate qD = \u00b11.0 (injection - production) with normal faulting\nregime. The situation represented by Table 5.4 (c = 0.0269757 m2/s, using Lline = km,\nthe result is ?FR = ?0.8) is critic when the velocity has positive x axis direction (left-right\ndirection). The fault at offset 1 for time tD = 0.01 (e.g. 38 d) has a strong tendency\nbecause the production induces rock contraction and favors reactivation (see Figure 5.26\n(Top)). If this flow occurs in the opposite direction negative x axis direction, the fault at\noffset 1 has a tendency to reactivate for constant injection twice as large, i.e. ?FR = ?0.4\n(invert sign of ?FR) at tD = 0.02 (e.g. 77 d) (see Figure 5.26 (Bottom)).\n\nTable 5.4: Model parameters for injection/production scheme.

However, for opposite flow direction, in the negative x axis direction, this fault\nreactivates for tD = 0.08 (e.g. 308 d) (see Figure 5.27 (Bottom)) when the production\nrate is twice the one in table 5.4 (invert the sign of ?FR).\n\nCase 2\n\nIn this case, injection at reservoir flanks to maintain reservoir pressure is analyzed. Using\nthe rate of production in Table 5.5, c = 0.0269757 m2/s, Lline = 10 km, and the corre-\nsponding threshold value is ?FR = ?0.4. Figure 5.28 and 5.29 (Top) show that for time\ntD = 0.08 (i.e 308 d) fault at offset 1 is near to reactivation, since after tD = 0.09 (i.e. 346\nd) or 38 d of constant injection in flanks (see Figure 5.28 and 5.29 (Bottom)). The fault\nbegins to stabilize, since injection expands the rock in favor of positive values of ?FR.\n\nTable 5.5: Model parameters for injection on flanks and production on middle region.

Fault reactivation\n\n5.3 Summary\nFault instability due to uniform depletion of a reservoir and due to various non-uniform\ndepletion strategies has been analyzed by conducting an extensive parametric analysis\nusing dimensionless LPA calculations. Computations have been compacted in charts for\ndifferent reservoir geometries and depths using dimensionless parameters. Also, several\ninteresting effects on fault stability were shown according to the literature.\n\n\n\n6. Discussion\n\n6.1 Main results\nAn implementation for fault reactivation analysis based on Biot\u2019s linear poroelasticity\nof cross-sections in half-space, under plane strain conditions, has been developed. LPA\ntakes into account both traction and displacement continuity between the reservoir sides.\nThe developed code allows considering the reservoir to have rather arbitrary shapes and\nnon-uniform pressure distribution inside the reservoir by modeling diffusive mono-phasic\nflow, and different material properties of the reservoir and the surrounding medium. Us-\ning this program, redistributed stresses around a depleted, homogeneous reservoir with\nnon-uniform pressure distribution have been calculated and the fault instability due to\nreservoir depletion has been analyzed.\n\n6.2 Conclusions\nFrom this work, it can be concluded that:\n\n\u2022 Using numerical modeling it was corroborated that fault reactivation potential is\ndependent on reservoir geometry, dip angle, reservoir shape and material contrast.\nHence, it is very important to consider the real reservoir geometry in the analysis\nof induced fault reactivation.\n\n\u2022 Different reservoir depletion strategies affect the fault stability differently. Pore\npressure gradients inside the reservoir have a greater tendency to reactivate and\ninduce slip of the nearby faults. Direction of depletion is an important consideration\nin evaluating the fault zones prone to slip.\n\n\u2022 The Coulomb failure stress change methodology is appropriate for settings where\nfaults are relatively close to their frictional limits (e.g., recently or currently active\nfold and thrust belts; recently or actively subsiding basins). However, in an absolute\n\n99\n\n\n\n100 Chapter 6. Discussion\n\nsense, a positive ?CFS value will not necessarily result in a significant risk of fault\nreactivation in settings where the shear stresses on existing faults are relatively low.\n\n\u2022 In literature, it is common to find numerical hydromechanics models that not con-\nsider an reasonable side burden rocks size. In order to avoid boundary effects a\nseries of computations are presented in charts to model regions near or far of reser-\nvoir domains with acceptable accuracy.\n\n\u2022 An implementation using NeoPZ environment was developed. It can be used to anal-\nyse fault reactivation tendency by means of linear poroelasticity equations using or\nnot dimensionless calculations. Dimensionless calculations allow LPA calculated\nthermoelastic problems in structural analysis. Also, a 3D extension of this compu-\ntational implementation is trivial since it was developed in a generic environment\nto develop finite element programs.\n\n\u2022 During the development of this work, several multiphysics classes in NeoPZ en-\nvironment were created and their corresponding validation for linear poroelastic\nmonophasic flow is shown in this dissertation. LPA computations compared sev-\neral analytic and semi-analytic solutions presented in literature and the commercial\nsoftware STARS.\n\n\u2022 The fault reactivation analysis presented in this work applies to multiphase flow\nmodels since the pressure coupling of the equations is given for an average of the\npartial pressure of each phase, when linear poroelasticity is assumed.\n\n\u2022 NeoPZ environment allows the quick development of complex finite element pro-\ngrams since it uses the paradigm of Object Oriented Programming.\n\n6.3 Recommendations for future work\nThe developed approach provides a basis for a robust reservoir simulation accounting for\nthe poroelastic effects on geologic faults. The following modifications/additions to this\nmodel are recommended for future work:\n\n\u2022 Several LPA characteristics were not presented in this dissertation; modeling no\nconductive faults, modeling several reservoir with heterogeneous formations. Hence,\nit is recommended to evaluate these characteristics.\n\n\u2022 LPA has not been adequately tested by back-analyzing case histories of production\nand injection-induced fault slip.\n\n\n\n6.3. Recommendations for future work 101\n\n\u2022 Extension to three dimensions, multiphase flow and permeability-stress coupling.\n\n\u2022 Model the mechanical interaction between fault blocks and the depleting reservoir,\nas well modeling fault slip to obtain a more accurate estimate of fault onset and\nslip. This implies non linear analyses.\n\n\u2022 The current model assumes completely reversible, elastic rock mass response to\nboth depletion and injection. However, especially in poorly consolidated rocks, the\nstress\u2013strain response during compression can be very different from the response\nin extension. This implies the use of nonlinear models.\n\n\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\nM.A Addis. The influence of the reservoir stress-depletion response on the lifetime con-\nsiderations of well completion design.

Dimensionless forms\n\nA.1 Computation of dimensionless forms\nBased on the proof of the Buckingham ? theorem and the homogeneity theorem Wong\n(1990) gives the matrix relationships:\n\nSpar = RparPpar (A.1)\n\nwhere Spar is the secondary variable matrix, Ppar is the principal variable matrix, Rpar\nis the relationship matrix that contains the dimensionless groups by choosing Ppar and\nSpar, from the complete set of parameter involved in the problem. Rpar is computed as in\nWong (1990) using:\n\nRpar = SparP?1par (A.2)\n\nthe dimensionless form of the equations in question are obtained by inserting the dimen-\nsionless groups calculated in the original expressions.\n\nStep load direct dimensionless formulation\nThe analysis is based on length [m], mass [Kg] and time [s] as fundamental units.
