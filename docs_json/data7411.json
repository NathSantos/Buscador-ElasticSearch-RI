(2016) Water security and ecosystem-based adaptation in the headwaters \n\nof Cantareira Water Supply System, Brazil. Doctoral Thesis, Sao Carlos School of \nEngineering, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Carlos. \n\nWater quantity, availability and, particularly, quality of Brazilian freshwater is under \nprogessive degradation \u00a0 due \u00a0 to \u00a0 Anthropocene\u2019s \u00a0 environmental changing conditions. Strategies \nof Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) are essential to mitigate these impacts. This Ph.D. \nthesis proposes a new model of water resources management, thereby integrating self-\npurification and ecohydrologic processes to evaluate ecosystem services from watershed \nunder change. In   Chapter 2, this thesis examinates the payment for hydrologic ecosystem \nservices (Water-PES) in Brazilian Atlantic Forest and points ecohydrologic variables useful \nfor assessing and further valuing hydrologic services. In Chapter 3, this thesis discusses \nproposals for freshwater monitoring plan which integrate quali-quantitative aspects for EbA \nand Water-PES projects. Therefore, in Chapter 4 experimental quali-quantative freshwater \ndata from in-situ field observations are investigated according land-use/land-cover (LULC) in \nheadwaters of water supply systems. In Chapter 5, through simulated impacts on freshwater \nyield from scenarios of LULC change, the grey water footprint (greyWF) is assessed, as well \nas environmental sustainability of sub-basins is depicted from a new ecohydrologic index for \nassessing hydrologic services. The methodology is performed using through field sampling \nand lab-analysing of physico-chemical, biologic and hydraulic variables in nested sub-basins \ndraining to the Cantareira Water Supply System, in Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais states, Brazil. \nThese areas participate in the Water-PES projects Water Producer/PCJ and Water \nConservator at headwaters of Piracicaba watershed, during recent severe drought conditions \nbetween years 2013-15. The greyWF is estimated from outputs of time series simulated \nthrough ecohydrologic model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Under assumption \nof continuity of Water-PES projects, and using the same series of hydrometorological records \nfor a common period (2008-2014), freshwater quali-quantitative impacts are performed \nthrough \u00a0 three \u00a0 LULC \u00a0 scenarios: \u00a0 past \u00a0 situation \u00a0 \u201cS1\u201d (year \u00a0 1990), \u00a0 current \u00a0 situation \u00a0 \u201cS2\u201d (year \n2010) and future situation \u201cS2+EbA\u201d (year 2035). From these scenarios, flow and load \nduration curves, mean water yields, greyWF and seasonal variabilities, were simulated. \nThrough this research, continuous-monitoring Data Collecting Stations were installed in \npublic-private partnership encompassing EESC/USP, ANA, CPRM, CEMADEN, SMA, \nTNC, WWF and local mayors. This continuous monitoring is addressed to increase the \nsystem resilience, based on better decision-making for water security, in strategic headwaters \nnot only for water supply, but also for environmental conservation. This doctoral thesis brings \ncontributions to a better comprehension of anthropic impacts on water resources and for \nstrategies of EbA in front of progressive rates of losses of ecosystem services.

Foi realizada a instala\u00e7\u00e3o de tr\u00eas \nPlataformas de Coleta de Dados, por meio de parceria entre EESC, ANA, CPRM, CEMADEN, SMA, \nTNC e WWF, visando aumentar a resili\u00eancia do sistema, decorrente de futuro aprimoramento da \ngest\u00e3o, para a seguran\u00e7a h\u00eddrica. A metodologia incluiu coletas em seis diferentes per\u00edodos, durante \ndois anos, e an\u00e1lises das vari\u00e1veis condutividade el\u00e9trica, cor, DQO, DBO5,20, nitrato, nitrito, \nnitrog\u00eanio amoniacal, fosfato, pH, turbidez, s\u00f3lidos totais, coliformes termotolerantes, Escherichia \ncoli, medidas de vaz\u00f5es e velocidades m\u00e9dias em se\u00e7\u00f5es transversais. O m\u00e9todo foi aplicado em \nmicrobacias participantes dos projetos Produtor de \u00c1gua/PCJ e Conservador das \u00c1guas, dentre \noutras, com \u00e1reas de drenagem entre 7 e 1.000 km2, que contribuem para a bacia do rio Piracicaba \n(12.530 km2). Dados prim\u00e1rios, medidos em recente per\u00edodo de severa estiagem no Sistema Cantareira \n(2013-14), foram integrados aos bancos de dados de \u00f3rg\u00e3os gestores federais e estaduais. A produ\u00e7\u00e3o \nde \u00e1gua foi maior em sub-bacias menos florestadas. Foi poss\u00edvel aprimorar a regionaliza\u00e7\u00e3o de cargas \npoluidoras por \u00e1rea de drenagem na regi\u00e3o do Cantareira. A pegada h\u00eddrica cinza (WF) foi estimada a \npartir de simula\u00e7\u00f5es no modelo ecohidrol\u00f3gico Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Curvas de \nperman\u00eancia de vaz\u00f5es e carga poluidora por \u00e1rea de drenagem foram elaboradas.

Research Context \n\nLife depends on water. Before humans have learnt how to write, they have been \n\nhunters and food gatherers. Agricultural revolution becomes possible to live in permanent \n\nvillages. Thus, early state civilizations have been developed along the rivers. They built \n\nhydraulic structures, such as cisterns, dams, dikes and aqueducts in Tigris-Euphrates, Nile and \n\nIndus valleys around 4,000 b.C., i.e., from the late Holocene. In Latin America, the Mayas \n\nand Incas also developed ancient water systems. These advances in water supplies and \n\ndistribution were interrupted around the fall of the Roman Empire. \n\nUrban civilizations have replaced those small villages by cities. Agriculture has \n\nprogressively replaced the forests. As populations have growth, concerns have arisen in \n\ndealing with the multiple uses of water resources, i.e., irrigation, flood protection and \n\nwastewater drainage. On the one hand, the hydraulic innovations were needed for human \n\nsupply. On the other hand, these technologies and deforestation become ecosystems even \n\nmore vulnerable as a result of anthropogenic impacts. \n\nSince the mid-XXt h century, the rapid human population growth, sophisticated \n\ntechnological development and increased consumption of resources have accelerated the \n\nwater pollution and scarcity. FAO (2016) estimates that there will be need an increase in 60% \n\nof global food production to feed more than nine billion people forecasted to live on planet by \n\n2050. This persistent human impact on Earth seems reflect on a new epoch in the geological \n\ntime scale: the so called Anthropocene (Crutzen, 2002). Waters et al. (2016) summarized the \n\nkey markers of anthropogenic changes which are indicative of the Anthropocene. For \n\nexample, the biotic change, which encompass species invasions and accelerating extinction. \n\nFurthermore, human-induced stressors are reshaping marine, freshwater and terrestrial \n\necosystems in unprecedented ways (Magurran, 2016). \n\nThe water cycle connects the abiotic environment (lito- and atmosphere) with the bio- \n\nand anthropospheres, thereby leading the distribution of life on Earth (Ehret et al., 2014). In \n\nturn, freshwater ecosystems have been recognized as among the most threatened ecosystems \n\n\n\n2 \n \n\nin the world since 20 years ago (Postel; Daily &amp; Ehrlich, 1996, Brauman et al., 2007; Dodds \n\net al., 2013; Brauman 2015). Estimates point that at least 10,000\u201320,000 freshwater species \n\nare extinct or at risk, with loss rates comparable to those of previous succession Pleistocene-\n\nHolocene. It has been showed that 65% of \u00a0 Earth\u2019s river discharge and habitats associated are \n\nmoderately to highly threatened (V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty et al., 2010). \n\nIn his pioneering work, A.G. Tansley (1935) proposed \u00a0 the \u00a0 term \u00a0 \u201cecosystem\u201d, \u00a0\n\nencompassing abiotic and biotic factors, as well as their functional and structural \n\nrelationships. Moreover, terrestrial ecosystems influence freshwater by moving and modifying \n\nflows in ecohydrologic processes. The relationships among ecohydrologic processes are \n\nstrongly non-linear (see Rodriguez-Iturbe, 2000; Zalewski&amp;Robartz, 2003; Olden., Kennard \n\n&amp; Pusey, 2012; J\u00f8rgensen, 2016; also called geo-bio-hydrologic processes by Kobiyama; \n\nGenz &amp; Mendiondo, 1998). This ecohydrologic processes in both aquatic and terrestrial \n\necosystems provide benefits for humans, i.e. ecosystem services (Daily, 1997; MEA, 2005). \n\nThis term was first used in literature by the couple Erlich (Erlich &amp; Erlich, 1981), both \n\nbiologists from Stanford University. \n\nIn water resources, three classes of ecosystem services, provisioning, regulating and \n\nsupporting and their links, are of relevance. Provisioning services involve the production of \n\nrenewable resources (for example, freshwater). Regulating services are those that indicate \n\nbenefits arising from regulation of ecological processes and hence lessen environmental \n\nchange (for example, climate regulation, water purification, disease control, attenuation of \n\nhydrologic extremes like floods and droughts; Cardinale et al., 2012). Supporting services are \n\ncycles of transformation of energy and mass at ecosystems and they are the basis for \n\nproviding other ecosystem services (such as water and nutrients cycles, soil development; \n\nMEA, 2005). All types of ecosystem services have been progressively damaged by \n\nanthropogenic pressures. Despite the increasing number of studies on ecosystems services in \n\nlast years, interactions among land-use management, ecohydrologic processes and ecosystem \n\nservices delivery are still not fully understood (De Groot et al., 2010). \n\nLand-use/land-cover (LULC) changes are the main threats which induce unbalanced \n\nwater flows, biodiversity losses and interruption of nitrogen, phosphorous and other \n\nbiogeochemical cycles, depleting ecosystem services in large scales (Daily et al., 1997). \n\nEcosystem services generated in consequence of water and soil conservation within  the scale \n\nof watershed, catchments or river basins are defined as hydrologic services, i.e., when we \n\nconsider the human well-being as a result of the multiple uses of water resources (Brauman, \n\n2015; Dodds et al., 2013; Brauman et al., 2007). There are diverse links between hydrologic \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\n \n \n\nservices and ecohydrologic processes (Figure 1.1). According to V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty, Pahl-Wostl &amp; \n\nBhaduri (2013), \u201cHumans \u00a0are \u00a0changing \u00a0the \u00a0global \u00a0water \u00a0system \u00a0in \u00a0a \u00a0globally-significant way \n\nwithout \u00a0 adequate \u00a0 knowledge \u00a0 of \u00a0 the \u00a0 system \u00a0 and \u00a0 thus \u00a0 its \u00a0 response \u00a0 to \u00a0 change.\u201d Thus, the \n\nhydrologic ecosystem services concept can be related to their capacity to help solving water \n\nproblems, to identify and mitigate trade offs between management options. \n\nIn face of these significant changes, we need to understand how the ecohydrologic \n\nprocesses work, if we want to develop better policies on watershed management (Ricklefs, \n\n2015). For building this knowledge, we need to understand the complex and dynamic \n\ninteractions throughout diversities of phenomena in different scales, since catchments are \n\ncomplex dynamical systems. First, it is needed to study the continental hydrologic cycle and \n\nthe linked energy and mass transfers into the ecosystems. In this cycle, the water flows can be \n\ndivided into two: blue water (superficial and groundwater runoff) and green water \n\n(evapotranspiration and subsuperficial runoff) (Figure 1.1), in a way to become easier the \nwater resources management into a catchment. Second, the geobiochemical cycles are also \n\nimportant at the catchment scale. Thus, the potential provisioning of hydrologic services \n\ndepends on the water balance, e.g. the relationships between water availability and water \n\ndemand, both from natural variabilities and human-driven activities. \n\nRegarding policies on water resources, the basin plan comprises the primary \n\nmanagement tool for sustainable use of water resources in both spatial and temporal scales. \n\nHowever, to date, adaptive management alternatives have seldom been incorporated in the \n\nBrazilian basin plans, such as Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA). Neither integrated quali-\n\nquantitative analysis, nor combined indicators of human-ecosystem appropriation of \n\nfreshwater resources have been established in basin plans. Among these quantitative \n\nindicators, I should highlight the water footprint - WF (Mekonnen &amp; Hoekstra, 2015; \n\nHoekstra et al., 2011; Hoekstra, 2003), because it encompasses grey, blue and green portions \n\nof water into a unique indicator for evaluating the sustainability arising from water resources \n\npollution and consumption. For sustainable water allocation planning, the river plans must be \n\nelaborated based on accurate data on actual water availability per basin, taking into account: \n\n(i) \u00a0 water \u00a0 needs \u00a0 for \u00a0 humans;? \u00a0 (ii) \u00a0 environmental \u00a0 water \u00a0 requirements \u00a0 and \u00a0 (iii) \u00a0 the \u00a0 basin\u2019s \u00a0 ability \u00a0\n\nto assimilate pollution (Mekonnen et al., 2015). \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\n \n  \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFigure 1.1.

Right side: hydrologic services framework showing how \necohydrologic flows impact the ways people can use water at the catchment scale. Adapted from Brauman (2015), Ellison et al. (2012), Gordon, \nPeterson &amp; Bennett (2008), Zalewski &amp; Robarts (2003). \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\n \n \n\n            Some countries have used the WF concept as an auxiliary tool for better water \n\nresources planning and management. For example, Spain enacted a regulation to use the water \n\nfootprintin watershed plans (Vel\u00e1zquez et al., 2011; Aldaya et al., 2010). In Brazil, the \n\nwatershed plans estimate the water demand by surface water and groundwater abstractions. \n\nHowever, a recent rule from the Brazilian National Water Agency recommends the inclusion \n\nof the WF indicator among other indicators to characterize the technical reports (ANA, 2015).  \n\nAccording to Hoekstra et al. (2011), WF \u00a0 measures \u00a0 both \u00a0 the \u00a0 direct \u00a0 and \u00a0 indirect \u00a0 \u201cwater \u00a0\n\nuse\u201d \u00a0 within \u00a0 a \u00a0 river \u00a0 basin. \u00a0 The \u00a0 term \u00a0 \u201cwater \u00a0 use\u201d \u00a0 includes \u00a0 water withdrawal: the consumptive \n\nuse of rainwater (the green water footprint) and of surface/groundwater (the blue water \n\nfootprint), and water pollution, i.e., the volume of water used to assimilate the pollutant loads \n\n(the grey water footprint, greyWF). The water footprint standards encompass four phases: (1) \n\nSetting goals, (2) Accounting, (3) Sustainability assessment, and (4) Response formulation. \n\nWF studies can be restricted to one specific activity of these phases or be related to more than \n\none phase. In this research, I address phases 2, 3 and 4 of an overall investigation of WF \n\nproposed by Hoekstra et al. (2011). \n\n \n\n1.2. Research Motivation \n\nAs a Biologist, I have worked on water resources management at Sao Paulo \n\nEnvironmental Secretariat in 2008-2014. I was introduced to the Water Footprint after the 5t h. \n\nWorld Water Forum, Turkey, 2009. The WF appeared as an indicator of (regulating) \n\necosystem services with potential application in Sao Paulo watersheds, especially in the scope \n\nof Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) projects. In 2011, I co-organized a Workshop on \n\nPES with 500 participants and a reference book on PES (Pagiola; von Glehn &amp; Taffarello, \n\n2013). Among the pioneering Brazilian PES initiatives, I highlight \u00a0 the \u00a0 \u201cWater Producer/PCJ\u201d \n\nproject and its possible nexus with WF. Throughout this context, I gave speeches outside \n\nBrazil in Mexico (Taffarello &amp; Mendiondo, 2011; Taffarello et al., 2011) and in Dominican \n\nRepublic (Aligning Water Fund Investment Prioritization in Latin America Workshop). Also, \n\nI have completed the 1\u00ba Water Footprint Training Course in Brazil \n\n(TNC/WWF/USP/Univ.Twente), when I have met Prof. A. Hoekstra and Prof. E. M. \n\nMendiondo, who used to work on ecohydrology (Mendiondo, 2008). Prof. Mendiondo and I \n\nhave noticed that a conceptual rationale was lacking to link PES, ecohydrologic processes and \n\nWF at changing watersheds. \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\n \n  \nI was intrigued because even with the evolution of those projects, some water related \n\nquestions have persisted, such as: 1) How would hydrological monitoring be for PES \n\nprojects? 2) What conditions and criteria about their linebases or benchmark for comparing \n\nPES schemes? 3) How to build partnerships among stakeholders responsible for these \n\nmonitoring in long term, since decades are needed to notice water quality variations from \n\npossible PES results at the catchment scale? 4) What kind of ecohydrologic issues are needed \n\nto promote proper valuation of PES projects at the catchment scale?  \n\nTo address these knowledge gaps, the current research was carried out using \n\ncomplementary inductive and deductive methods (Pathirage et al., 2008), encompassing \n\nexperimental investigations and ecohydrologic modelling. Using as case study strategic \n\nheadwaters of South-East Brazil, this Ph.D. research purposes a new conceptual model for \n\nwater resources management, integrating ecohydrologic aspects and the greyWF for hydro-\n\nservices assessment at different catchments scales. Besides the geographical and socio-\n\neconomic relevance of the study area, climate change and poor water resources management \n\nadded temporal relevance. Sao Paulo almost experienced a collapse on water supply during \n\nthe years of this research (Nobre et al., 2016; Escobar, 2015; Manca, Falconi, Zuffo &amp; Dalfr\u00e9 \n\nFilho, 2014). \n\n \n\n1.3. Hypothesis \n\nThe current research assumptions are, mainly, related to hydrologic services as \n\nregulating ecosystem services, as proposed by Brauman (2015). In this context, identifying \n\nthe hydrologic services of interest can help define which ecohydrologic processes to monitor \n\nfor improve water resources management. For this reason, Ecosytem-based Adaptation (EbA) \n\nis here addressed with selected variables. Among the ecohydrologic variables, I highlight the \n\ngrey water footprint (greyWF) as a robust and relatively straight forward for dealing with \n\nnutrient loads upstream to downstream at different scales of watersheds. Thus, based on \n\nZhang et al. (2010), the greyWF can reveal the hydrologic regulating services throughout the \n\nuse of rivers capability of autodepuration. From this background, the assumptions of this \n\ndoctoral thesis are: \n\n? First, the interactions between the hydrological cycle and the sustainability of the \n\necosystems can be linked to ecohydrologic processes and variables. Identifying \n\nspecific ecohydrologic processes can be an adequated method for verifying the \n\ndelivery of hydrological services in spatial and temporal scales in which the targeted \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\n \n \n\nservice is generated. Especially, because the use of this method is still not explicitly \n\nincorporated into Brazilian mechanisms of Payment for Environmental Services (PES) \n\nfor watershed protection. \n\n \n\n? Second, because riparian forests contribute with autodepuration in streams and rivers, \n\nI expect to find better relationships between river water quality and forested land use \n\ntypes, which can be shown by lower greyWF for nutrients, such as nitrate and total \n\nphosphorous; \n\n \n\n? Third, the correlation between greyWF for nutrients and water yield from catchment \n\nrunoff I here postulate as a new indicator for assessment of hydrologic services. \n\nTherefore, studying this relationship through comparing scenarios with and without \n\nEbA allow us maintaining the ecosystem services of the river-catchment system for \n\nthe long term. \n\n \n\n1.4. Objectives \n\nThe main objective of this thesis is to create a multidisciplinary and new framework \n\nwhich integrates ecohydrologic aspects and the grey water footprint for the assessment of \n\necosystem services for protection of changing watersheds. This assignment, applied into the \n\ndrainage watersheds of the Cantareira Water Supply System can contribute for the \n\nimprovement of the water resources management in the context of catchments revitalization. I \n\nused literature review, planned a freshwater monitoring and field investigations through quali-\n\nquantitative freshwater sampling, integrated into three scenarios performed by an \n\necohydrologic model to investigate an inter-related range of specific objectives (Figure 1.2): \n \n\n(i) In the context of Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA), evaluate the payment for \n\nhydrologic ecosystem services in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and elucidate ecohydrologic \n\nvariables useful for hydrologic services assessments and further valuation;  \n\n \n\n(ii) Develop a hydrologic monitoring plan for Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) \n\nprojects;  \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\n \n  \n (iii) Provide new experimental data sets, integrating water quality and quantity \n\nsamples from in-situ field observations, to study the role of land-use/land-cover (LULC) \n\nchange at headwaters of water supply systems; \n\n \n\n(iv) Assess the hydrologic services based on grey water footprint sustainability in \n\ncatchments under LULC change, encompassing best management practices as EbA option. \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2. Methodological framework of the doctoral thesis and links among four chapters. \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n \n \n\n1.5. Thesis Structure \n\nA methodological framework for this research and links between chapters is displayed \n\nin Figure 1.2. I organized this thesis into four chapters, modified versions of manuscripts, \n\nwhich address a set of my progressive knowledge on ecohydrologic processes and their \n\ninteractions with ecosystem functioning and human needs. This is essential for a proper \n\nhydrologic services evaluation at catchment scale.  \n\nThe thesis is structured as follows: after this introduction (Chapter 1), I begin with \nsome ecohidrologic general definitions and an overview of water-related PES projects (Water \n\n\u2013 PES) in Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Then, I build a conceptual framework from ecohydrologic \n\nvariables for integrated water resources management and provide some insights on how \n\nWater-PES may contribute as an Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) option to face the \n\nchanging conditions of catchments in the Atlantic Forest biome (Chapter 2). \nThe next step is to envision a viable freshwater monitoring plan, which integrates \n\nquantitative and qualitative aspects of water resources, for the selected study catchments: the \n\nmicro catchments eligible to participate in the Water Producer/PCJ project (Chapter 3): \n\nCanc\u00e3 (58 km2) and Moinho (17 km2). By planning and discussing conditions for efficiency \n\nin its implementation, this third chapter represents a conceptual link for the next. \nThen, I present results from a multi-site, nested catchment experiment, carried out \n\nduring a dry period (September 2013 \u2013 May 2014) within the Cantareira Water Supply \n\nSystem (hereafter referred as the Cantareira System), linking quali-quantitative freshwater \n\nmonitoring to land-use/land-cover change evaluated by satellite images (Chapter 4). A quali-\n\nquantitative analysis of 17 catchments shows regional variabilities and trends for nitrate loads \n\nversus drainage areas (0.66 to 925 km2). The field experimental method is resultant from the \n\nbaseline of a monitoring that can allow the evaluation of maintenance of ecohydrologic health \n\nof streams in long term. In brief, the primary data brought by these field investigations outline \n\na scale sensitive behavior, offering a useful tool for proactive management. Besides, these \n\nfield data were used to calibrate the ecohydrologic model and compare the model \n\nperformance regarding discharge and loads in the next chapter.  \n\nAlthough hydrological models provide hypothesis testing of complex dynamics \n\noccurring at river basin scales, freshwater quality modeling is still incipient at many Brazilian \n\nriver catchments. In Chapter 5, I compare freshwater quality scenarios under different \n\nLULC, one of them related to Ecosystem-based Adaptation option. Using the spatially semi-\n\ndistributed SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model, nitrate and total phosphorous \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\n \n  \n\nloads were modeled across Brazilian subtropical catchments with drainage areas ranging from \n\n7.2 to 1037 km2. Part of these catchments are eligible areas of the Brazilian PES-programs \n\nWater Producer and Water Conservator in the Cantareira System, which until the drought in \n\n2013-14 supplied water to 9 million people in the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Region. On the one \n\nhand, simulations of nitrate and total phosphorous allowed the regionalization of grey water \n\nfootprint (greyWF) at different spatial scales under LULC change. On the other hand, \n\nconservation practices simulated envisage not only viable best management practices, but also \n\npreventive decision making at the headwaters of water supply systems.   \n\nIn Chapter 6, I summarize and conclude my doctoral thesis with a discussion of how \n\nthe ecohydrologic processes are crucial for a comprehensive hydrologic services evaluation. \n\nAccording to Cunha &amp; Calijuri (2012), we should make the best or most effective use of \n\nnatural resources, minimizing the impacts and look for the best solutions. In this context, \n\nwhen the reduction of the greyWF is not possible, I purpose the compensating of the greyWF \n\nthrough implementation of EbA strategies. This can be a techno-scientific viable solution, \n\neconomically advantage (because \u00a0 the \u00a0 \u201cwater \u00a0 provider\u201d receive financial incentives for \n\nmaintenance of health forests and freshwater ecosystems) and politically feasible, in \n\naccordance with a river basin focus on the integrated water resources management for the \n\nsustainable development. \n\nThus, the chapters of this thesis are timely and relevant on water security, with a \n\nspecific focus on water quality. Here, I would like to acknowledge the inspiring cooperation \n\nof my co-authors, which makes my work possible. All four chapters are published or under \n\nreview in peer-reviewed international journals: Science of the Total Environment (Chapter 2), \n\nJournal of Environmental Protection (Chapter 3), Water International (Chapter 4) and Water \n\nResources Research (Chapter 5).

Journal Impact Factor 4.31. \n \n\nAbstract \n\nPayment for ecosystem services (PES) 1 is being widely proposed as a strategy for water \n\nresources conservation. Similarly, Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) has been globally \n\nencouraged as an option to climate and land-use change. Our objective was to review \n\ninformation on Water-PES initiatives in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a hotspot for \n\nbiodiversity conservation where several water-PES projects have been stablished. We found \n\n16 ongoing Water-PES in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. The first initiative was launched in \n\n2005, and since then water-PES projects have rapidly grown. In spite of the success of many \n\nof these initiatives and their real advances, they seldom have hydrological baseline data and \n\nan implemented strategy for ecohydrological monitoring. Thus, we discuss how Water-PES \n\nprojects could be more effective by implementing hydrological monitoring based on \n\necohydrology concepts, and how an integrated hydrological services valuation in water-PES \n\nprojects would contribute as Ecosystem-based Adaptation options to climate and land-use \n\nchanges. \n\n \nKeywords - hydrologic ecosystem services; Ecosystem-based Adaptation; ecohydrology; \nAtlantic Forest; Brazil. \n \n\n                                                 \n\n \n1 PES: Pay ment for Ecosy stem Services, EbA: Ecosy stem-based Adap tation, ES: Ecosy stem Services, InVEST: \n\nIntegrated Valuation Ecosy stem Services and Tradeoffs, RIOS: Resource Investment Op timization Sy stem, SWAT: Soil and \n\nWater Assessment Tool. \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\n \n \n\nHighlights \n\nx Since 2005, many water-PES initiatives have been launched in the Brazilian \nAtlantic Forest.  \n\n \n\nx Water-PES schemes lack for hydrologic monitoring and options to cope with \nchallenges under change. \n\n \n\nx Hydrologic ecosystem services assessments are not integrated in the Water-PES \nschemes.  \n\n \n\nx An ecohydrologic framework for ecosystem services assessments is proposed. \n \n\nx This framework is a tool for integrated water resources management and \necosystem-based adaptation. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1. Introduction \n\nThe Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) through incentive strategies to conserve \n\n(Buckley &amp;Pegas, 2014; Joly et al., 2014) or to restore (Banks-Leite et al., 2014; Palmer &amp; \n\nFiloso, 2009) ecosystems represents possible solutions to prevent the degradation of water \n\nresources and related ecosystem services. This procedure can be instrumental not only to \n\nreduce the risks of inadequate land use, but also to manage and adapt to climate change and \n\nmegadroughts (Underwood, 2015; Seppelt et al., 2011). In Latin America, particularly in \n\nBrazil, climate change adaptation options have been widely encouraged (Escobar, 2015; \n\nMarengo et al., 2015; Phillips et al., 2009). \n\nThe outcome of RIO + 20 provided a view that if development is to be truly \n\nsustainable; we need to value nature (Munang et al., 2013; Thiaw &amp; Munang, 2012). This \n\ngoal is based on the context of new scientific and policy awareness about climate change over \n\nthe past 20 years (Tanner et al., 2015). Also, the concept of ecosystem-based adaptation \n\n(EbA), \u00a0 as \u00a0 \u2018the use of biodiversity and ES to help people adapt to the adverse effects of climate \n\nchange\u2019, \u00a0 was \u00a0 defined \u00a0 by \u00a0 the \u00a0 Convention \u00a0 on \u00a0 Biological \u00a0 Diversity \u00a0 10t h Conference of the \n\nParties (CoP) (CBD, 2010). According to EbA, protecting environmental services is required \n\nto help people and ecosystems to reduce their vulnerability and increase their resilience to \n\nclimate change impacts (Marengo et al., 2014).  \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\n \n  \n\nScientists worldwide look for quantification and integrated methods to measure the \n\nvalue of hydrological ES (Brauman, 2015, Brauman et al., 2007, Broadbent et al., 2015, Duku \n\net al., 2015, Naeem et al., 2015) to enable the effectiveness of PES initiatives. A pioneer \n\ntechnique, based on a benefits transfer approach, found that the economic value of 17 ES for \n\n16 biomes averaged US$ 33 trillion per year and was 1.8 times higher than the global gross \n\nnational product of 1995 (Constanza et al., 1997). This value was recently updated to a range \n\nbetween US$ 125 and US$ 145 trillion/year (Costanza et al., 2014).  \n\nAnother study assessed the global human impact on the potential value of six freshwater \n\necosystem services (water quality, water availability, greenhouse gases, biodiversity, \n\ncommodities and disturbance regulation) based on composite indexes (Dodds et al., 2013).  \n\nEcohydrology is the interaction between biota and hydrology (Zalewski &amp; Robarts, \n\n2003), and the incorporation of its concepts can help to fill the gap between environmental \n\nscientists and engineers for achieving sustainable and integrated water resources management \n\n(Zalewski, 2014, 2015). Ecohydrology therefore provides the tools to address the current \n\nenvironmental challenges, such as the imbalance between water demand and available water \n\nresources. This subject has become more visible internationally with the Agenda Post-2015 \n\nfor sustainable development (UN-Water, 2014) and in Brazil with the expected discussions in \n\nthe next 8th World Water Forum, which will be held in Bras\u00edlia, Brazil, in 2018. \n\nDespite the advances and increasing number of PES studies, some questions remain \n\n(Naeem et al., 2015; Pagiola et al., 2013), such as: how can the efficiency of the Water-PES \n\nprojects, built through partnership between governments and stakeholders, be evaluated in the \n\ncontext of watershed under change? In what manner could the private companies or \n\ngovernment provide better incentives for the participation of new stakeholders, e.g. water \n\nusers and river basin committees, into PES markets? What methodological strategies of \n\necohydrology can be used to achieve faster advances in PES schemes under comparative EbA \n\nframeworks? And, what are the lessons learned from ongoing Brazilian Water-PES projects in \n\nthe context of risk-based or EbA assessments?  \n\nThis study aims to address PES in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil, as a climate change \n\nadaptation option. First, we systemize information about PES projects implemented in the \n\nBrazil\u2019s Atlantic Forest. Then, we present the development of ecohydrology and EbA \n\nconcepts, and discuss how Water-PES projects can become more effective and reduce the \n\nvulnerability to climate change impacts, in an example of EbA option. \n\n \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\n \n \n\n2.2. Water-PES projects in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest \n\nWe compile information about PES in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest using previous \n\ninformation provided by Guedes &amp; Seehusen (2011), only considering actual PES cases, and \n\nPagiola et al. (2013). Then, we expanded and detailed the list of PES initiatives by consulting \n\nspecific published documents. We prioritized peer-reviewed articles but also considered \n\npublications in grey literature, thesis and dissertations, and the professional experience of the \n\nauthor in the projects. In addition, a questionnaire was sent to PES project managers to obtain \n\nsupplementary information. \n\nIt was possible to acquire information on more than 60 Brazilian PES projects, \n\nclassified in four types of ES: (a) protection of river basins (Water-PES); (b) carbon sink; (c) \n\nbiodiversity protection; and (d) scenic beauty protection. From this sample, we selected only \n\non the ground Water-PES and found 16 initiatives in Brazil\u2019s Atlantic Forests, created since \n\nthe last decade (Table 2.1). Although we selected only the implemented projects, there are \n\ntwice as many water-PES initiatives in articulation or development in different Brazilian \n\nstates.  \n\nThe first Atlantic Forest (and Brazilian) PES scheme, the \u201cProjeto Conservador das \n\n\u00c1guas\u201d at Extrema-MG, started in 2005 (Richards et al., 2015). Since then, Water-PES \n\ninitiatives have rapidly expanded in the Atlantic Forest, and, on average, 1.5 new Water-PES \n\nprojects have been initiated per year. The Atlantic Forest occurs in 17 Brazilian states, but we \n\nfound Water-PES projects only in six states of South and South-East Brazil (Fig. 2.1), \n\nindicating Water-PES projects are not equally distributed through this vast and populous \n\nbiome. Sao Paulo state, which is the most populous and richest (highest gross national \n\nproduct) state in Brazil, concentrated 40% of the implemented water-PES initiatives in the \n\nBrazilian Atlantic Forest.  \n\nDespite Water-PES projects in the Atlantic Forest vary on their area of abrangency and \n\nnumber of beneficiaries, only three of 16 initiatives (\u201cMina D\u2019\u00c1gua\u201d, \u201cBolsa Verde\u201d and \n\n\u201cPrograma Reflorestar\u201d) are state programs occurring at a regional scale (Table 1). Most of \n\nthe initiatives occur at local scale, in important catchments for urban water supply. For \n\nexample, \u201cConservador das \u00c1guas\u201d and \u201cProdutor de \u00c1gua/PCJ\u201d are within the Cantareira \n\nWater Supply System, while \u201cO\u00e1sis S\u00e3o Paulo\u201d are around Guarapiranga and Billings \n\nreservoirs, in both cases, systems that supply water for the 20 million people of S\u00e3o Paulo \n\nmetropolitan area.  \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\n \n  \n\nTable 2.1.

Brazilian Water-PES Projects per state in the Atlantic Forest biome. \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\n \n  \n\nAll the on the ground Water-PES projects found in the Atlantic Forest pay for rural \n\nlandowners, often through legal agreements (PES contracts varying in years of duration), \n\nwhich is not always the case for other Latin America countries (Bremer et al., 2016). \n\nMoreover, most of them (12) have already established legal instruments to secure the project \n\nand the flux of resources through time. Finally, all the initiatives have the conservation of \n\nforest remnants an eligible action for PES while forest restoration, soil conservation, organic \n\nagriculture and adoption of rural sanitary measures (for example, installation of septic tanks \n\nor sewage treatment) are considered for some of them.  \n\nForest restoration, when considered as an eligible action, is focused on riparian areas \n\ncalled APP or \u201cPermanent Protection Areas\u201d according to the Brazilian forest law (Soares-\n\nFilho et al., 2014). Restoration of degraded APP is mandatory for landowners. Thus, our \n\nresults show that Water-PES initiatives at Atlantic Forest often pay for actions in legally \n\nprotected areas. Furthermore, most of the Water-PES initiatives provide other benefits to \n\nparticipants beyond the PES, paying part or integrally the costs for land management actions \n\nthat generate the PES (Table 2.1). Thus, some Water-PES projects constitute an opportunity \nto landowner to receive PES as well as to comply with Brazilian forest law, with no costs.  \n\nWe found public (federal, state, and municipal initiatives), private (companies and \n\nfoundations) and non-profit organizations working with PES for the protection of watersheds \n\n(Table 2.1). Arrangements are diverse and involve multiple stakeholders, mixing public, \n\nprivate and non-governmental organizations, corroborating the idea that, for PES, one size \n\ndoes not fit all (Bremer et al., 2016). Having the local government leading the PES project is \n\nthe most common situation in the Atlantic Forest. One rare case is the Oasis Project at S\u00e3o \n\nPaulo, where the leading institution is a private foundation (Tabela 2.1). Interesting cases \narise from \u201cProdutor de \u00c1gua/PCJ\u201d, \u201cProdutores de \u00c1gua e Floresta\u201d and \u201cConservador das \n\n\u00c1guas\u201d, located in watersheds that charge water users (Tabela 2.1). In these initiatives, PES \nfor landowners is made integrally or partly, directly by the River Basin Committee, using the \n\nresources obtained through charging for water use. This scheme fits the polluter-payer and \n\nprovider-recipient concepts (Taffarello et al., 2016b, Viani &amp; Bracale, 2015). Other frequent \n\nand similar arrangement is the direct involvement of water supply and sanitation institutions. \n\nIn some initiatives, as the \u201cCamboriu River\u201d and \u201cO\u00e1sis-Apucarana\u201d the legal arrangements \n\nwere already established to guarantee part of the revenue of these companies for the project \n\n(Table 2.1).  \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\n \n \n\nFinally, six projects are linked to the \u201cWater Producer\u201d program, a concept that was \n\nintroduced in the country by the National Water Agency, with the objective of supporting \n\nWater-PES projects that focus on improving water quality, increasing water supply and flow \n\nregulation (ANA, 2012). In spite of being all linked to the Water Producer Program, each of \n\nthese six initiatives has your own local functioning, diverging with regard to scale of action, \n\ninstitutional arrangement, and amount of resources invested for implementation and \n\nmaintenance of the project (Table 2.2).  \n\nBesides the 16 Water-PES projects summarized in Table 2.1, we highlight more two \nWater-PES programs due to its national importance: \u201cCutivando \u00c1gua Boa\u201d and \u201cOlhos \n\nd\u2019\u00c1gua\u201d. First, \u201cCutivando \u00c1gua Boa\u201d, is a program from binational Itaipu and partners \n\nwhich aims the headwaters and riparian forests conservation, and sustainable methods of \n\nfarming. Second, \u201cOlhos d\u2019\u00c1gua\u201d, is a Water-PES program accomplished by the NGO \n\n\u201cInstituto Terra\u201d, founded by the famous Brazilian photographer Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado. The \n\nproject is sponsored by Vale and supported by (i) EMATER-MG (technical rural assistance) \n\nand (ii) the Manhua\u00e7u river basin committee.  The Manhua\u00e7u river basin is totally inserted in \n\nthe Minas Gerais state, \u201cZona da Mata\u201d and Doce river valley, with drainage area of 9,189 \n\nkm2. The investments in headwaters conservation have been increased by the  \u201cOlhos \n\nd\u2019\u00c1gua\u201d program, since 2013. At least US$ 630,000a were performed by the program \n\nbetween 2013 and mid-2015 (http://www.institutoterra.org/projetos/VALE/).  \n\nMore than 1.900 landowners have already signed Water-PES contracts in the Atlantic \n\nForest, resulting in more than 48,000 ha of land managed for water resources conservation \n\n(Table 2). By far, the most common land management originating Water-PES is conservation \n\nof the remaining forest patches (Table 2.2). Atlantic Forest remnants are protected by a \nspecific law (\u201cLei da Mata Atl\u00e2ntica\u201d) and their legal suppression for other land uses is very \n\nrestricted. Thus, PES for forest conservation is more acceptable by landowners than actions \n\nthat directly affect their agricultural lands (Viani &amp; Bracale, 2015).

In addition, especially for forest restoration, \nthey prioritize actions for riparian areas, critical areas for hydrological services. However, not \n\nall the projects have the PES values varying according to the amount and/or quality of the \n\ngenerated hydrological services, only few of them have already established hydrological \n\nmonitoring and none of the initiatives condition the PES to direct measures of the \n\nhydrological services (Table 3.3). In fact, in all of the projects, payments to landowners are \ndone assuming that implementation of eligible actions (forest restoration and conservation, \n\nsoil conservation, etc.) guarantee the existence of the hydrological services. Thus, advances \n\nfor hydrological services valuation and monitoring in Atlantic Forest Water-PES initiatives \n\nare needed.     \n\n2.3. Ecohydrology as a tool for valuation of hydrological services  \n\nRiver flow dynamics and the interaction of flow with landscape provide a large \n\nnumber of ES that can (i) improve water quality, (ii) create positive socioeconomic effects \n\nand (iii) regulate land use and water use. However, the conversion of natural land cover to \n\nhuman uses, henceforth called land-use/land-cover change (LULC), influences river water \n\nflows mainly by reducing the absorption and the filtration of water flows. In addition to the \n\nimpacts of human activities, such as agriculture, urbanization, industry, rapid population \n\ngrowth, sub-urban development and building of dams, extensive research also shows the \n\nadditional impact of climate change on ES (Ehret et al., 2014, Hallegatte et al., 2014, \n\nMarengo et al., 2014, Nelson et al., 2013, Palmer et al., 2009, Pedrono et al., 2016).  \n\nOn the one hand, changes in precipitation, air temperature and wind regimes are the \n\nmain consequences of extreme climate variability and climate  change impacts on hydrologic \n\nservices flow (Nickus et al., 2010). One recent example could be the drought of the megacity \n\nof Sao Paulo, where due to a drought during austral summer of 2013-14 the main reservoirs \n\nhad reached storage levels of only 5% of their 1.3 billion m3 capacity, generating a severe \n\nwater crisis aggravated by a combination of lack of rainfall, higher temperatures, increasing \n\npopulation and water consumption (Escobar, 2015, Nobre et al. 2016, Taffarello et al., \n\n2016a). On the other hand, at local and regional scales, ecosystem flows may be altered due to \n\nchanges in the water cycle, changes in river flow regimes or changes in groundwater level and \n\nother factors. To quantify and integrate these hydrological and ecological processes, an \n\necohydrological framework can be applied (Fig. 2.2). \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\n \n\nTable 2.3.

G: changes in flow duration curves between present and future flow regimes.  \n\n\n\n30 \n \n\n \n  \nIn a typical river basin scheme (Fig. 2.2-A), there are several ecohydrological variables. \n\nThe geo-hydrological processes (Kobiyama et al., 1998), also known as eco-hydrologic \n\nprocesses, interact in a non-linear way (Mendiondo, 2008, Zalewski, 2014, 2015). Such \n\nprocesses define the river regime, the ecosystem flow and ES, generated because of soil \n\nconservation and the (non)protection of water resources and biodiversity in watersheds. \n\nA healthy river promotes responses to changes in the landscape and climate change. The \n\nnatural sinuosity of the main channel across the floodplain produces flow characteristic and load \n\ndischarges at the cross section. Thus, the main channel is defined up to the bankfull condition \n\nwith water level at h* value. Flooding events above h* occupy the floodplain over a time series \n\nand define high flow regimes (h>h*) in the flow duration curves. \n\nEach pulse flood over time (Fig. 2.2-B) can be characterized by frequency, intensity, \n\namplitude and seasonality (Neiff et al., 2008, Richter et al., 1997). As a result, categories of \n\nsinuosity, continuity, diversity, dynamics, resilience and vulnerability constrained by 18 \n\necohydrological variables can express the conditions of river ecosystems (Mendiondo, 2008). \n\nFor example, an ecohydrological variable can determine the frequency of pulses for the number \n\nof flood pulses per time period (X3, Fig. 2.2-B). For a determined flood pulse (Fig. 2.2-C), the \n\necohydrological variable X10 defines the ratio of time duration above flood level and time \n\nduration of total flood pulse. The higher the X10, the stronger is the river biodiversity. Both \n\necohydrological variables X3 and X10 influence how pollutant loads can be lower or higher than \n\nthat observed for flows at high water levels. Because water levels are related to river discharges, \n\nat non-linear relationships (X12 = 'Qy'h in Fig. 2.2-D), time series of water levels h(t) can be \n\nconverted into flow discharges Q(t) at the same cross sections (Fig. 2.2-E). Similarly, situations \nof Q(t)>Q* represent flood pulses.  \n\nFrom the above discussion, LULC changes can alter normal flow regimes (Fig. 2.2-F), \n\nintensifying flow extremes with higher floods or lower droughts. Flow duration curves, \n\nrepresented by the frequency of time permanency of flows, usually depicts a monotonically \n\ndownward flow curve for all curves measured at the river cross-section. A new ecohydrological \n\nvariable X16 of changing reference flows, i.e., at 5% ('Q5%) and 95% ('Q95%) could be assessed \n\nfor non-stationary conditions of flow duration curves. \n\nIn summary, these new ecohydrological variables can help quantifying ES (in other words, \n\nassess how the landscape context influences the amount of hydrological services) in Water-PES \n\nschemes. From this interaction, the \u201cwater+climate\u201d composition is the main sustainability \n\nelement (Moss et al., 2010, Tucci &amp; Mendes, 2006), directly influencing biodiversity. Since the \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\n \n\npotential of hydrological services depends on the equilibrium of the water balance (variable \n\ngiven the natural oscillations or induced by impacts from anthropic and/or climatic factors), \n\nbesides the functional distribution of the ecosystems on the watersheds, we propose a framework \n\nto achieve integrated assessments of ES in water-PES initiates. \n\n2.4. Impacts, Vulnerability and Adaptation linked to Water-PES Projects \nSome countries have made efforts to adapt to climate change and variability, for example, \n\nthrough the conservation of key ecosystems, compensation for ES, and the use of early-warning \n\nsystems and climate forecasts. However, global change is a strong stressor that threatens human \n\nwater security and biodiversity (V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty et al., 2010). Besides, there are different climate \n\nchange scenarios for Brazil up to the end of the twenty-first century (Fig. 2.3), indicating how \nunpredictable the impacts are. The 2013-14 drought in South-East Brazil, mentioned before, \n\nwhich led to a water crisis for 85 million people, is an example of these hard to predict scenarios, \n\nwhich impact both freshwater ecosystems and people.  \n\nThe valuation of river health and associated ES involves several challenges regarding how \n\nto account for the vulnerabilities to land use and climate change impacts and uncertainties. Here \n\nwe outline how an EbA contributes to reducing risks in three steps. First, we briefly introduce \n\nthe impact-vulnerability-adaptation rationale (IVA). Second, we show the conditions that appear \n\nto fill the gap between the PES practices and on-hand opportunities from EbA to improve our \n\nknowledge on adaptation options. Finally, we discuss about expanding the classification of \n\nWater-PES projects, in an EbA approach, to enhance more efficient practices towards valuing \n\nES.  \n\nThe vulnerability of an ecosystem can be viewed in the changes in ecohydrological \n\nvariables (Figure 2.2). The flood pulses across river cross-sections, floodplain and regime \nduration are seen in the quantitative percentile flows (or flow duration curve). Climatic extreme \n\nevents increase the flow 5% of the time and decrease the outflow 95% of the observed time \n\nperiod, hence a higher (in the ordinate) and flatter (in the axis) duration curve is found (Fig. 2-\n\nG). Moreover, the higher water level (at the overflow height) can bring about a buffer effect of \n\npollutants transported by the inadequate land-use. \n\nAn EbA approach could result firstly from the ecohydrological monitoring baseline of the \n\nWater-PES projects, which will allow assessing the maintenance of ecohydrological health of \n\nriver systems. This proposal is flexible, applicable in other watersheds and offers a good cost-\n\nbenefit relationship, besides being easily understood and desirable since the PES has been \n\nrecognized as a measuring indicator for the EbA (BFN/GIZ, 2013).  \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\n \n  \n\nFigure  2.3. Brazilian regional scenaries of climate change projected by INPE climate models until the \nend of the twenty-first century. The symbols in the leaves (change indicators) are the same used in the \nIPCC AR5 (IPCC, 2014) and the degrees of reliability are evaluated according to the consistency between \nthe projections of three regional INPE models and the IPCC AR5 global models. \n\n \n\n2.4.1. Risk assessment and adaptation  \n\nThe types of admissible risks in ES are manageable at the river basin scale have been \n\ndiscussed (Lin et al., 2013, Wunder, 2006). At least one previous study has emphasized the need \n\nfor research incentives in the risk management area and adaptive management (AR-5 IPCC, \n\n2014). Then, Naeem et al. (2015) found that of 118 USA-PES projects analyzed, most do not \n\nensure scientific integrity in their environmental interventions, among other factors, because \n\nthere are no metrics to assess the risks, as for instance, climate change. Aiming to fill part of this \n\ngap, we recommend that water risks of Water-PES projects be categorized in terms of \n\nvulnerability, impacts and adaptation strategies. \n\nFirst, risk assessment is related to a specific combination of factors related to hazards, \n\nexposure and vulnerability, which can evolve to a disaster condition. Second, hazards are closely \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\n \n\nrelated to ecosystem variables at extreme behaviors across spatiotemporal scales where \n\necosystems develop their respective functions. These react to decision-making drivers and \n\nscenarios (MEA, 2005). However, the degree of susceptibility of the ecosystems to water \n\nhazards includes their characteristics with regard to vulnerability conditions, especially \n\nconsidering hydrological prediction in ungauged or poorly gauged basins.  \n\nThird, impacts are addressed in terms of comparing vulnerability characteristics with the \n\nsupport capacity of the environment to counterpart hazards (Montanari &amp; Koutsoyiannis, 2014). \n\nThe adaptation options are the types of non-structural or structural measures to help the \n\necosystem recover to the equilibrium conditions without the effects of risks (Palmer et al., 2009). \n\nThis recovering capacity, included in the resilience concept (Baggio et al., 2015, Russell et al., \n\n2012, Tanner et al., 2015), is scale-dependent and dependent on the type of risk condition \n\n(Mendiondo, 2010), which could be incorporated in the Water-PES projects in the long term \n\n(Mazzocato et al., 2013, Naeem et al., 2015, van de Sand, 2012, Wunder, 2006). \n\n \n\n2.4.2. Water-PES initiatives &amp; Ecohydrology  \n\nLinking ecohydrologic processes and human well-being is crucial in the ecosystem \n\nservices framework (Brauman, 2015). To achieve better water quality by reducing \n\neutrophication, some ecohydrological categories can be useful to address water challenges (Bunn \n\n&amp; Arthington, 2002, Hannah et al., 2011, Vannote et al., 1980, Zalewski, 2015). All these \n\ncategories are classified in accordance with principles of continuity, dynamics, resilience, \n\nvulnerability and diversity, which affect ecosystem interactions across the river basin scale \n\n(Richter et al., 1997). The delivery of hydrological services is measured (for example, \n\nmeasurement of flow, water quality variables or sediment levels) and/or simulated in \n\necohydrological models, such as SWAT (Bressiani et al., 2015; Francesconi et al., 2016), \n\nInVEST (Bremer et al., 2016, Guimar\u00e3es, 2013, Tallis et al., 2011, 2012) or RIOS (Vogl et al., \n\n2016). Besides, indirect methods to find this delivery can be quantifying water treatment costs to \n\nthe end-users of hydrological services, as discussed by Osuna et al. (2014), or investigating the \n\nvalue of a protected park\u2019s water contribution to end-user (Strobel et al., 2007). In any of these \n\nmethodologies, assessments of ES through its quantification are needed. In this context, Water-\n\nPES projects would have to benefit of ecohydrology as a promising tool for includes metrics in \n\ninterventions. \n\nTable 2.3 shows that, with the exception of 1 initiative (Camboriu), there have not been \necohydrologic monitoring since before start of the interventions (to create the baseline). It is a \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\n \n  \n\nchallenge to build integrated monitoring guidelines which encompass actions before, during (to \n\nassess project performance and provide feedbacks) and after the end of Water-PES project \n\nactions. \n\nForward these guidelines, at least 4 ecohydrological categories are feasible to monitor in \n\nWater-PES projects, such as continuity, diversity, resilience and vulnerability (see Mendiondo, \n\n2008, Table 5). Integrating hydrology and limnology in a holistic problem-solving strategy, \n\necohydrologic tools improve water quality for freshwater ecosystems and become easier \n\nwatersheds restoration (Zalewski &amp; Robarts, 2003).  \n\nIn this context, both freshwater quality and quantity play a key role in network of \n\nprovisioning and regulating ecosystem services interactions. Qualitative and quantitative \n\nfreshwater monitoring should be performed in an integrated manner. From this perspective, we \n\nrecommend the plan and accomplishment of freshwater monitoring in the long term. It is crucial \n\nto link the monitoring data to Water-PES project outcomes, revealing the quality and frequency \n\nof available data where benefits for ecosystem and landowners can be realized \u2013 this is scarce in \n\nBrazilian Atlantic Forest\u2019s Water-PES projects. If baseline and freshwater monitoring exist, the \n\nevaluation of project performance based on delivery of ES become easier. In turn, it provides \n\nreliability for ES buyer and allows comparison among Water-PES projects. Thus, a checklist of \n\necohydrological indicators, water quality variables and river morphology characteristics would \n\nhelp to delineate and classify the Water-PES projects. It is shown in Table 2.4.  \nIn spite of the expansion of Water-PES projects in Atlantic Forest Brazil, they have not \n\nfully implemented hydrological monitoring (Table 2.3). Besides, there are inconsistencies or the \nabsence of standards, definitions and methodologies for the hydrological monitoring in Water-\n\nPES projects. Nested Catchment Experiments (NCE), comparing freshwater monitoring from \n\nheadwaters to downstream river (Mendiondo et al., 2007, Zaffani et al., 2015), are suitable to \n\nstudy Water-PES under flood pulse approach (Fig. 2 A-C). NCE are flexible in terms of river \n\ncharacterization (Rosgen, 1994), geomorphologic river networks (Rodrigues-Iturbe, 2000) and \n\n\u201cthe river active area\u201d methodology (Smith et al., 2008). Pollution loads across nested scales \n\nshow how ecosystem diversity is affected by human-driven occupation of the basin, and also \n\nnested scales can show the possible further effects of river restoration through Water-PES. \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\n \n\nTable 2.4.

(2016) \nBENISTON &amp; STOFFEL \n(2013) \n \n\n \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\n \n  \n\nAnother opportunity could be implementing integrated load and flow duration curves \n\n(Cunha et al., 2012) for hydrological ES assessment. For example, (i) in-situ observations of \n\nwater bodies could elucidate the role played by LULC at upstream catchments involved in \n\nPES (Taffarello et al., 2016a) and (ii) for the improvement of a semi-distributed model with \n\nexperimental data. To date, we have observed a good relationship between phosphate and \n\nnitrate loads versus drainage area (0.66 to 925 km2) and have demonstrated the actual need for \n\necohydrological monitoring to test the PES benefit assumptions and to improve scientific \n\nframeworks including tools, metrics and methods for Water-PES projects selection. \n\nMonthly quality data are limited and the planning and execution of field campaigns \n\nare costly and time consuming in Brazil. Thus, ecohydrological models are necessary to \n\nconstruct the load duration curves. Regarding available data sources for applying \n\necohydrological models in Brazil, Bressiani et al. (2015), in a review on Brazilian SWAT \n\napplications, list an extensive array of data sources and include on-line locations for many of \n\nthe data sources in an Appendix. Recently, SWAT has been used as a methodological \n\nframework for quantifying ES to support decision-making (see review of Francesconi et al. \n\n2016). Besides SWAT, other agricultural watershed models can help in facing this challenge \n\n(Alvarenga et al., 2016, Cuartas et al., 2012, De Mello et al., 2016). \n\nUsing quality and quantity data for the same period of time, collected preferably at the \n\nsame sites (or selecting as the nearest stations) enable ecosystem functions evaluation by \n\napplying qualitative and quantitative permanence curves. Future scenarios of climate and \n\nland-use changes can be evaluated by these curves, as shown schematically (Fig. 2 F-G).  \n\nMoreover, by using the grey water footprint (amount of freshwater required to \n\nassimilate pollutants) related to nitrogen and phosphorous inputs (Hoekstra &amp; Chapagain, \n\n2008, Hoekstra et al., 2011, Mekonnen et al., 2015), qualitative and quantitative permanence \n\ncurves could be used to quantify the ES, which could be measured as the volume of \n\nfreshwater needed to dilute the pollutant loads (Zhang et al., 2010), i.e., the water required for \n\nthe self-depuration capacity of rivers. Concerning the needs for adaptation actions, we suggest \n\nevaluating the grey water footprint for nitrate, since nitrogen is one of the most mobile \n\nelement. Both point and diffuse nitrogen source impacts on freshwater can be investigated \n\nwith ecohydrological models. Then we could assess: (i) how polluting loads are produced \n\nunder different land use in the current climate and in the future, and (ii) the impacts of best \n\nmanagement practices (BMP), such as EbA (Fig. 2.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.4 Illustrative interlinkages among methodologies of Ecosystem-based Adaptation, \nRisk-based Analysis, and Water Footprint. Legends (1): drivers of change: i.e. population \ngrowth, land-use and land-use change (LULC), climate change, consumption habits, \ninstitutional governance evolution, (2): ecohydrological monitoring, (3) field investigation \nand data mining, (4) modeling, calibration, validation and uncertainty analysis. \n \n\nBased on Naeem et al. (2015), we propose that Water-PES projects should use \n\necohydrological variables (Fig. 2) for delineation, monitoring and comparison of Water-PES \n\nprojects. This facilitates the access to public and private investments, which in turn will \n\nstrengthen and enhance the EbA in Brazil.  \n\nIn essence, the full efficiency of an EbA mechanism could be measured across the basin \n\nand compared to other initiatives in the same basin. Ultimately, Water-PES tradeoffs could be \n\nrelatively different depending on the scale used to analyze and the variables incorporated in \n\nthe assessment and valuation of hydrological ES. This comparison, through hierarchy metrics \n\nand analysis of the selected ecohydrological categories, enables to reflect on how the EbA \n\nmethodologies, specifically Water-PES projects, can minimize the vulnerability to the impact \n\nof climate chang \n\n \n\n2.5. Water-PES as ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change \nEcosystem-based Adaptation addresses the links between climate change, water cycle, \n\nbiodiversity and sustainable resources management. Ecohydrological approaches, by \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\n \n  \n\npreserving and enhancing ecosystems, allow to measure and evaluate these interactions. It is \n\nessential that EbA strategies contribute to the resilience of ecosystems (Fiering, 1982, Tanner \n\net al., 2015,), protect livelihoods and mitigate poverty (Engel et al., 2008, Hallegatte et al., \n\n2014, Pagiola et al., 2010). \n\nConsidering the EbA approach, Water-PES should be spatially implemented in river \n\nbasins, preferably in heterogeneous landscapes, and with efficient technical support to the \n\nfarmers. Studies show that carefully implementing these programs can bring significant water \n\nquality (Keeler et al., 2012) and biodiversity benefits (Whittingham, 2011). However, the \n\npotential of PES in climate change adaptation has been little realized (van de Sand et al., \n\n2014). \n\nMajor risks and uncertainties surround the extent to which climate variability, climate \n\nchange and other changes could modify the water cycle in relevant regions for the \n\nimplementation of PES projects such as the EbA type. For example, changing rainfall, snow \n\nand ice melt patterns could affect how water transfers through soils and ecosystems and hence \n\nriver flows and groundwater recharge. These changes present potential risks and benefits to \n\nsociety. Increased water security for developing countries occurs in integrated systems for \n\necosystem sustainability under climate change (Ambrizzi et al., 2007, Liu et al., 2015, \n\nMarengo et al., 2011). This means it is vital to ensure sufficient quality, quantity and \n\ndistribution of water for productive use, ecosystems, through environmental flows \n\n(Arthington et al., 2006, 2010, Arthington, 2015), human health and to minimize water-\n\nrelated risks to people, environments and economies. \n\nWhile there are many Water-PES programs in Brazilian Atlantic Forest (Fig. 2.1, \n\nTable 2.1), it is still hard to put a price on some other valuable hydrologic services provided \nby Amazonian forests, such as the recycling of atmospheric moisture and its transport to \n\nregions outside, such as the Atlantic Forest.  \n\nKey questions still should be solved to achieve ecosystem sustainability services. For \n\nexample, should the states in central and southern Brazil pay the Amazonian states because \n\nthe rain that falls in their fertile lands comes from the Amazon region?; How much does one \n\ncubic meter of water costs? And how much water moves from Amazonia to central-southern \n\nBrazil? One thing we know is that changes in forest coverage and the services offered by the \n\nforest may affect the moisture provision from Amazonia to central-southern Brazil. The \n\nprovision of these services may be a determinant for vulnerability that is enhanced by climate \n\nchange. Failure to reduce the magnitude or rate of climate change will plausibly lead to \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\n \n\nchanges (often decreases) in the value of ES provided, including moisture recycling. \n\n2.6. Conclusions \n\nWater-PES initiatives have rapidly expanded and advanced in the Atlantic Forest in \n\nBrazil. However, most of them still lack ecohydrological monitoring strategies, which would \n\nprovide the baseline for the standardization, comparison and hierarchization of projects. We \n\nargue this is essential to validate implemented land management actions as generators of \n\nhydrological services and, consequently, to prove effectiveness of PES projects in providing \n\nhydrologic ES. Moreover, this approach could in turn increase public and private awareness \n\nand investments in Water-PES initiatives.  \n\nConcerning the multiple uses of water, the balance for maintaining the services that \n\nwatersheds provide is only achieved through equitable water governance and ES \n\nmanagement. We highlight that any adaptive management cannot be achieved without \n\necohydrological monitoring. Thus, integrated assessment and valuation of ES should use \n\necohydrology variables as tools.  \n\nFinally, ecohydrological monitoring is crucial to reduce EbA uncertainties, contribute to \n\nconsolidate water resources information system, improve ecohydrological modelling and \n\nintegrated water resources management. Future work remains to be done to link the \n\nhydrological services to dynamic and integrated assessment models to better understand how \n\nthe complex processes of land use and climate changes affect the environment.  \n\n2.7.

Journal Impact Factor 1.02. \n \n \n\nAbstract \n\nBoth Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) and Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) \nhave a wide range of definitions that include many economic instruments for nature \nconservation. Although the generation and maintenance of payment for hydrologic ecosystem \nservices (Water-PES) is expanding in Brazil, there are difficulties in the implementation of \nprojects. Due to the complexity and non-linearity of the geomorphological processes, also \naffecting both EbA and Water-PES goals, monitoring quali-quantitative aspects of streams \nhave been here addressed as a useful management tool. This study presents the Freshwater \nMonitoring Plan (FMP) of the Water Producer/PCJ project, operating since 2009, in order to: \ni) evaluate the impact of project actions under quali-quantitative aspects; and ii) promote the \nincorporation of FMP\u2019s elements in water resources management. FMP of the Water \nProducer/PCJ project has been implemented following the conditions for efficiency (baseline, \nlong-term scale compatible with the actions of the project, in the experimental and reference \nwatersheds). Spatial and temporally, FMP is being implemented from upstream to \ndownstream in catchments with areas ranging from 17 to 130 km . This new proposal favors \nthe quantification and valuation of hydrologic services that could be assessed by \necohydrologic monitoring (Chapter 4 of this Thesis) and modeling (Chapter 5 of this Thesis). \nThus, we look forward to the consolidation of the Brazilian information system of water \nresources, the reduction of modeling uncertainties and integrated assessment of the \nconsequences of land-use/land-cover change that strongly impact goals of EbA and Water-\nPES initiatives.  \n\n \nKeywords \u2013 freshwater monitoring; Brazilian Water Producer/PCJ project; hydrologic \n\nservices; quali-quantitative aspects of water resources  \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n51 \n \n\n \n\n3.1. Introduction \n\nThe hydrologic ecosystem services, hereafter referred as hydrologic services, are the \n\necohydrologic natural processes arising from river flow dynamics and flow/riparian areas \n\ninteraction which benefit people. These processes can, for example, improve water quality, \n\nregulate flood risks, increase recreational opportunities and create positive socioeconomic \n\neffects. Hydrologic services are quantified by quali-quantitative river monitoring. The Active \n\nRiver Area assessment (Smith et al., 2008; Palmer et al., 2009) methods can also be applied in \n\nthe monitoring, as it considers the hydrologic connectivity and natural variability of riparian \n\nareas from the headwaters downstream to the catchment\u2019s \u00a0 outlet. Several authors have \n\nproposed definitions of payments for ecosystem services (PES) for the water resources or \n\nbiodiversity protection, and carbon sequestration. Costanza et al. (1997) define them as \n\ncompensation for the benefits people obtain from ecosystems. They are considered voluntary \n\ntransactions in which a determined ecosystem service is purchased from a provider under the \n\ncondition of securing the service provision (Wunder, 2006).  Pagiola &amp; Platais (2007) added \n\ngenerating positive externalities to this concept. Balvanera et al. (2012) define them as the \n\navailability (or utility) of ecosystems for human needs. Furthermore, Muradian &amp; Rival \n\n(2012) relate PES with policy prospects and partnerships to align decision-making on land \n\nuse. The definition of PES is sufficiently broad to encompass various economic instruments \n\nfor environmental conservation (Pagiola, von Glehn &amp; Taffarello, 2013). On the one hand, \n\necohydrological processes (i.e. Zalewski, 2010; Mendiondo, 2008, among other authors) \n\ninteract nonlinearly. These processes affect biodiversity and primary production, and define \n\nthe river regime, environmental flows and hydrologic ecosystem services (Taffarello &amp; \n\nMendiondo, 2013). Specifically for Water-PES, the potential provision of these services \n\ndepends on the water-balance equilibrium of flows and pollution loads (Cunha, Calijuri &amp; \n\nMendiondo, 2012). On the other hand, Water-PES are dependant on the relationship between \n\navailability and demand, variable according to both (i) natural fluctuations or induced by the \n\nimpacts of human activities, and (ii) functional and distribution conditions of the ecosystems \n\nin \u00a0 the \u00a0 watersheds. \u00a0 In \u00a0 this \u00a0 interaction, \u00a0 the \u00a0 \u201cwater \u00a0 + \u00a0 climate\u201d \u00a0 composition is the main \n\nsustainability element for water security. Moreover, the insignificant water uses defined by \n\nriver basin committee based on Brazilian and Sao Paulo state water resources laws (n. \n\n9433/1997 and n. 7663/1991, respectively) add a recognized stress on water security. The \n\n\u201cinsignificant \u00a0 uses\u201d \u00a0 demand a detailed study on water withdrawal and wastewater disposal of \n\nsmall rural properties to ensure seasonal safe drinking water in these critical subbasins, \n\nstrategic for public supply and for ecosystem services delivery. The objective of the Water \n\n\n\n52 \n \n\n \n  \n\nProducer/PCJ project freshwater monitoring is to evaluate the PES economic instrument to \n\nstimulate the use of voluntary conservation practices for soil conservation, forest restoration \n\nin Permanent Preservation Areas (APP), and conservation of remaining forest fragments. It is \n\na pioneering pilot project in Sao Paulo state which includes public-private partnerships \n\n(Mazzocato, Taffarello &amp; Mendiondo, 2013), with the aim of providing support for larger \n\nscale projects (Padovezi et al., 2013). The objectives of the FMP of Water-PES projects are: \n\n- Characterize the natural freshwater quality of the catchments covered by the project \n\nto consolidate the respective PCJ/ River Basin Plan. \n\n- Determine the baseline of the project based on land-use/land-cover information, \n\nquestionnaires with information on environmental and socioeconomic perception; \n\n- Assess trends and hydrologic conditions, concentrations of monitored pollutants and \n\nthe expected limits for the re-systematization of water bodies; \n\n- Identify areas with potential water quality changes; \n\n- Promote mitigating actions for the prevention and control of soil and water pollution;  \n\n- Assess the effectiveness of project actions and long-term adaptation strategies; \n\n- Provide consistent information to assess the maintenance and future expansion of the \n\nproject or its replication in other Brazilian regions through new PES public policies; \n\n- Encourage the creation and maintenance of real-time monitoring database, which are \n\nable to issue environmental alerts, reducing the vulnerability2 of the watersheds and \n\nproductive sectors inserted there. \n\n3.2. Scope of this work \nThus, the objectives of this work are: (i) assess the impact of conservation actions in \n\nthe Water Producer/PCJ project through the freshwater monitoring plan (FMP) with key \n\nintegration to EbA and Water-PES projecs; and (ii) support the incorporation of FMP \n\nelements through water resources management tools, such as: information systems, river \n\nbasin plan, freshwater quality standards, water rights concessions and charging for water \n\nresources uses according to the current norms (Brazilian Water Law 9.433/97, Sao Paulo State \n\nWater Law No.7.663/91, No12.183/05 and Decree 50.667/06).  \n\n                                                 \n\n \n2Vulnerability  is the state of a sy stem exp osed to risks, controlled by  biop hy sical and socio-cultural factors at \n\ndifferent temp oral and sp atial scales, combined with its resp onsiveness (INCLINE/USP, 2013). \n\n \n\n\n\n53 \n \n\n \n\n3.3. Material and Methods \n3.3.1. Study area \n\nThe study area includes watersheds that contribute to the Piracicaba, Capivari and \n\nJundia\u00ed (PCJ) river basins, covering 15.304 km2. In the Sao Paulo portion of the PCJ river \n\nbasin, the Water Resources Management Unit No. 5 (UGRHI-5) has 14.178 km2 (92.6% of \n\nthe basin area), and the rest of the UGRHI-5 territory of the PCJ basins (7.4%) is located in \n\nMinas Gerais state. The PCJ basins have higher economic development and per capita income \n\nin Brazil. However, due to the high population density (301 hab/km2) compared to other \n\nBrazilian river basins, the use of this water is conflicting and eutrophication of the water \n\nsources is at an advanced stage (Cobrape, 2011). Because of it, in the last decade, the \n\nheadwaters of the sub-basin of the Atibainha and Jaguari rivers become of strategic interest. \n\nThe implementation of charging for the use of water resources in the PCJ Committees in 2007 \n\nallowed that part of the funds of water charging could be applied in the Water Producer/PCJ \n\nproject. In mid-2013 the project area covered 252 hectares in Joan\u00f3polis/Nazar\u00e9 Paulista \n\ncities, state of Sao Paulo. After three years of contracts between landowners and the financial \n\nborrower from PCJ Committees (2011-2014), the project area was 489 hectares, being 99 \n\nhectares of soil conservation, 68 hectares of forest restoration and the major part of forest \n\nconservation, i. e., 391 hectares (Taffarello et al., submitted).On account of the prior \n\ninformation and the scarcity of native vegetation, the catchments being part of the FMP are \n\npreviously selected: Canc\u00e3 (97 km2 ) and Cachoeira dos Pretos (130.4 km2), in Joan\u00f3polis, \n\nand Moinho (17.6 km2) in Nazar\u00e9 Paulista (Figure 3.1). \n\n3.3.2. Methods \n\nRegarding the self-purification3 process of rivers and streams, freshwater monitoring \n\nis critical for understanding the changes of pollutant concentrations in different seasons \n\n(Bottino, 2008; Mendiondo, 2008). To assess self-purification characteristics, quali-\n\nquantitative parameters were included into the FMP of the headwaters of the main tributary \n\nrivers to Sistema Cantareira: Jaguari (1.000 km2), Cachoeira (392 km2) and Atibainha (315 \n\nkm2) to find possible seasonal changes of pollutants or macronutrients (see Table 3.1). \n\n \n                                                 \n\n \n3Self-purification is the restoration of the water quality  after the changes induced by the discharge of \n\neffluents. The main parameters changed due to self-purification are the dissolved oxygen concentrations, \n\nbiochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and pathogenic microorganisms, river contaminants (von Sperling, 2005). \n\n\n\n54 \n \n\n \n  \n\n \nFigure 3.1. Catchments of the Water Producer/PCJ pilot project. \n\n \n\nLand-use/land-cover (LULC) change impact ecosystems and the services they provide \n\nin diverse scales. Regarding hydrologic services, LULC change is one of the most significant \n\nanthropogenic pressures which change water flows and modify regulating hydrological \n\nservices (Brauman, 2015; Rounsevell et al., 2012; Daily et al., 1997). In addition, slope, \n\ntopography, soil development and soil depth are also terrestrial characteristics of the \n\nwatersheds which impact hydrologic services, as we have shown in Figures 1.1 and 2.1 \n(Chapters 1 and 2, respectively of this thesis) and were reported by Koschke et al. (2014), \n\nTerrado et al. (2013), among others.  \n\nThe land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes of microcatchments contributing to public \n\ndrinking supply are crucial for the production of water in adequate quantities and quality \n\nconditions (Whately &amp; Cunha, 2007). Also, these changes lead to risks of potential water \n\ncrisis with impacts on vulnerable ecosystems and people (Tundisi &amp; Tundisi, 2015; Gordon et \n\nal., 2008).  \n\n\n\n55 \n \n\n \n\nTable 3.1.

This diagnosis helps \n\nunderstanding the current environmental quality of catchments for prospective EbA initiatives \n\nusing this FMP. Also, FMP improves the monitoring of Water Producer/PCJ project, as \n\nauxiliary tool in planning and selecting quali-quantitative sampling sites under LULC change, \n\nregarding water yield, seasonal flow-with-load regimes and ecohydrological variables (see \n\nFigure 2.1 of the thesis). After 6 GTM-Hydro meetings and several studies, we conclude that \n\nspecific conditions are crucial for effectivity of the freshwater monitoring. See 3.4.1 Section. \nComparing LULC in years 2003 and 2010, regarding soil uses, Figure 3.2 shows that \n\nthe anthropic use is higher in Canc\u00e3 catchment (66%) than in Moinho (around 50%) and \n\nCachoeira do Pretos catchments (49% in 2003 and 38% in 2010). There is a trend to reduce \n\n\n\n56 \n \n\n \n  \n\nagriculture areas in Canc\u00e3 and Cachoeira dos Pretos catchments, which is not observed in \n\nMoinho catchment. Both in Canc\u00e3 and in Cachoeira dos Pretos catchments part of agriculture \n\nhas been replaced by reforestation. This issue is relevant for the recovery of ecosystem since \n\nboth catchments are located in Cachoeira basin. Joan\u00f3polis municipality, where larger part of \n\nCachoeira basin is located, has 80% of its protected area occupied by pasture, agriculture, and \n\nbare soil (Whately &amp; Cunha, 2007). Then, current consumptive water use and intensive \n\nagriculture impact the blue and the green water availability in the Cachoeira basin (Rodrigues \n\net al., 2014).  \n\nAlthough the Water Producer/PCJ project started in 2009, FMP is at an early \n\nimplementation stage, which enhanced since 2013 onwards (see Taffarello et al., 2016). We \n\nbelieve that this FPM enables posing questions such as: Do Water-PES\u2019 actions of the Water \n\nProducer/PCJ project improve and conserve the water quality and water flow regulation in the \n\nheadwaters under LULC changes of the Cantareira Water Supply System? To address \n\nanswers through EbA methods, ecohydrologic experiments and modeling are needed. Using \n\nfield campaigns (episodic monitoring) and official database (systematic monitoring) from \n\nagencies engaged in FMP at PCJ committees, i.e. CETESB, DAEE, SABESP, INMET, ANA, \n\nCODEAGRO, CEMADEN, human impacts on quali-quantitative freshwater regimes are \n\nverified (Taffarello et al., 2013a; Cunha, Calijuri &amp; Mendiondo, 2012). Furthermore, possible \n\npositive impacts of Water-PES \u00a0 project\u2019s conservation actions are viable to screen explicitly \n\nthrough FMP. Further details about field evidences of episodic FMP and about ecohydrologic \n\nmodeling with EbA scenarios are, respectively, in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 of this thesis. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n57 \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.2.

Results and Discussion \n\nFrom the EbA approach, the Integrated Group of River Basins (N\u00facleo Integrado de \n\nBacias Hidrogr\u00e1ficas, NIBH) of the Sao Carlos School of Engineering, University of Sao \n\nPaulo with support from The Nature Conservancy (TNC), drafted a FMP proposal for Water \n\nProducer/PCJ project based on the document \u201cWater \u00a0 and \u00a0 Soil \u00a0 Monitoring \u00a0 Protocol \u00a0 \u2013 Water \n\nProducer Program\u201d (Diederichsen et al., in press). This FMP is in accordance with the \n\nNational Plan for Water Quality (PNQA) of Brazilian National Water Agency (ANA), and \n\nwith part of the hydrological monitoring in \u00a0 Water \u00a0 Funds\u2019 \u00a0 case \u00a0 studies \u00a0 in \u00a0 Latin \u00a0 America, \u00a0\n\norganized by Bremer, Vogl, de Bi\u00e8vre &amp; Petry (2016). The FMP was presented to Water \n\nProducer/PCJ project\u2019s \u00a0 partners \u00a0 in \u00a0 a Workshop held in May 2013 in Atibaia municipality, Sao \n\nPaulo state. Also, we fully presented a version of this FMP plan at the XX Brazilian \n\nSimposium of Water Resources, held 2013 in Bento Gon\u00e7alves, Rio Grande do Sul state \n\n(Taffarello et al., 2013b).  \n\nMetrics and indicators for evaluating PES effectivity are essential. Regarding the \n\nWater Producer/PCJ project, the HMP, especially Figure 3.2, seeks to help assessing the \n\nWater-PES implementation. Examples of these metrics or indicators can be: 1) PES project \n\narea/watershed area; 2) benefited population4/total watershed population; 3) applied financial \n\nresources related to benefits generated (lower water treatment costs and higher water yield, \n\nfor example). Thus, this HMP can help obtaining short- and long-term Water-PES project \n\nperformance, a scientific guideline for PES according to Naeem et al. (2015).  \n\nThen, to apply the quali-quantitative monitoring plan, which can further allow the \n\nassessment of PES implementation, some requirements are needed to monitoring sites \n\nselection. The first monitoring sites were determined based on scale compatible with Water-\n\nPES actions, aspects related to LULC changes and comparing EbA-reference catchments to \n\ncatchments targeted of conservation actions of Water-PES in the scope of Water \n\nProducer/PCJ project (Figure 3.3 and Table 3.2). Local LULC change allowed elucidating \n\nthe complexity of soil uses verified from field in loco diagnosis of water yield at these \n\nheadwaters. Field evidences showed LULC was as relevant on watersheds as used for public \n\nsupply, because local modifications impacted water quantity and quality. Freshwater quality \n\nwas jeopardizing because of agrochemicals used in conventional agriculture, and erosion \n                                                 \n\n \n4Benefited population, also called PES beneficiaries, here means the number of inhabitants living in 1) the PES \nproject areas, 2) downstream the PES project area, and/or 3) regions with flow transfers from PES project areas.  \n\n\n\n59 \n \n\n \n\nprocess due to urbanization. Also, urbanization and economic activities were performed at \n\nunappropriated areas, without planning, damaging water yield (as pointed by Whately &amp; \n\nCunha, 2007).  \n\nWe found erosion field evidences in these subtropical Oxisols during in loco visits \n\nwere expressive as previously related by Pereira &amp; Teixeira Filho (2009) and PCJ (2011). \n\nMendiondo et al. (2007) also related field evidences of surface flow water pathways related to \n\nerosion patterns in catchment laying on Oxisols with erosion rates of ca. 1 t/ha per year and \n\nvariable concentration of suspended solids. This evaluation justifies the FPM monitoring of \n\nwater flows and erosion on the watershed scale. In mid-2013, the monitoring includes two \n\nData Collection Platforms (DCP), four fluviometric scales and two barologgers. Barometric \n\nreadings are synchronized with the level readings. The equipment purchase, installation and \n\nmaintenance are the responsibility of ANA, TNC, WWF and EESC/USP. The location of \n\nequipments installation was determined by the Hydrologic Monitoring Working Group \n\n(GTM-Hydro) of the Water Producer/PCJ project, shown in Table 3.2 and Figure 3.4. \n\n \n\n \n \nFigure 3.3.

Effective Monitoring Conditions \n\na \u2013 Baseline conditions \nMonitoring should be implemented preferably before start of LULC interventions. \n\nThis is necessary to identify the baseline and to serve as a temporal analysis reference. The \n\nbaseline can identify possible positive changes as a result of the expansion of ecosystem \n\nservices promoted by the project, as well as ecohydrologic variables related, thereby \n\nencompassing the integration of quali-quantitative variables. \n\n \n\nb - Long-term monitoring \n\nThe PES pilot projects should necessarily have long-term monitoring. Regarding both \n\nquali-quantitative \u00a0 aspects, \u00a0 \u201clong-term\u201d \u00a0 is \u00a0 understood \u00a0 as \u00a0 a \u00a0 horizon \u00a0 span \u00a0 ranging between 30 \n\nand 50 years, to consolidate legal and socio-economic elements as well as LULC change. An \n\noperational framework is required to document the changes for the regular storing and \n\nanalysis of the field data collection.  \n\n \n\nc - Scale compatibility with project actions \n\nIt is crucial to have a significant geographic scope, integrating PES interventions at \n\nlocal scales, which will promote the maintenance and recovery of native soil vegetation in the \n\nriver basin scale, because it is assumed that the monitoring data obtained will reflect the \n\nexpected benefits from the actions through EbA. However, it is not easy to implement forest \n\nrestoration and soil conservation activities in a significant portion of the basin and within a \n\nshort period of time.  \n\nThus, it is recommended to implement the monitoring structure in the catchment \n\nscales scale, when there is a sufficient range of land use changes, to enable perceiving in the \n\nshort term the impacts on water quality and flow regime.  \n\n \n\nd \u2013 Reference and intervention catchments \nThe improvement and maintenance of the water quality conditions and hydrologic \n\nregime will be included in the monitoring of catchments where the forest cover has changed \n\nsignificantly, named as \u00a0 \u201cintervention\u201d \u00a0 catchment. A property located in the same catchment \n\nwas selected (which has the same physiographic, climatic and environmental characteristics), \n\nbut with no significant change in the original vegetation cover (minimum of 80% of native \n\nvegetation cover), named as \u00a0\u201creference\u201d \u00a0 catchment \n\n\n\n62 \n \n\n \n  \n\n3.4.2. Types of monitoring \n\nSpatial monitoring (nested catchment experiment)  \n\nFor the experimental catchments, monitoring quali-quantitative control sites of water \n\nyield is selected through Nested Catchment Experiment method (NCE,  McDonnell et al., \n\n2007; Mendiondo et al., 2007), as follows. Headwater reference catchments of 1st or 2nd \n\norder, with no forest restoration and soil conservation interventions are compared to \n\nheadwater catchments with project interventions. Both inside the same basin of 3rd order. \n\n \n\nTemporal monitoring \n\nThe variables have to be collected (i) systematically (quantitative), with time interval \n\nas a fraction of the observed time of concentrations, ie., the average response time of a \n\nrainfall-runoff process (Tucci, 1993; Tucci, 2008); and (ii) episodic (qualitative) based on \n\nseasonal campaigns (Bieroza et al., 2014; Abell, Hamilton &amp; Rutherford, 2013; Chiwa et al., \n\n2010). Specifically, in the Water Producer/PCJ project freshwater monitoring, we set uped the \n\ntime-step of continuous monitoring variables of water level, pressure and temperature each 15 \n\nminutes. The seasonal field campaigns have choosen to be bimonthly, to investigate the \n\nseasonal dynamics of river regimes, as explained in Figure 2.1 (Chapter 2 of this thesis).  \n\nWe also suggest using flow-load duration curves in the monitoring of the Water \n\nProducer/PCJ project, to describe the pollution loads according to flow rates, facilitating to \n\nvisualize the quali-quantitative natural behavior of freshwater resources (Chen et al., 2011; \n\nCunha et al., 2012; Taffarello et al., 2013a).  Flow and load duration curves demonstrate \n\nchanges in land use or climate in the watersheds (Taffarello &amp; Mendiondo, 2013). Studying \n\nflow-load duration curves under different scenarios, for example, including EbA or different \n\nrates of wastewater treatment, allows evaluating hydrologic services provided by Water-PES, \n\naddressing a more effective and reliable water security.  \n\n3.5. Conclusions &amp; Recommendations  \n\nRegarding the Water Producer/PCJ project, the following actions can be envisaged \n\nwith the freshwater monitoring here proposed: 1) complement the water resources information \n\nsystem in the PCJ Watersheds Committee; 2) Incorporate the information system in ANA\u2019s \u00a0\n\ndatabase (PNQA), CETESB and DAEE; 3) Estimate the detailed water balance in \n\nexperimental watersheds; 4) Anticipate the frequency curves of flow and loads; 5) Assess \n\nwater availability for water use permission; 6) Anticipate the balance of pollutant loads and \n\n\n\n63 \n \n\n \n\nthe re-categorizing of water bodies; 7) Estimate the green, blue and gray water flows, and \n\ntheir water footprint (according to Hoekstra et al., 2011); 8) Identify and prioritize low-\n\nsustainability critical areas by comparing availabilities and demands within the PCJ \n\nwatersheds; 9) Improve the information quality of user registration; 10) Support adaptation \n\nstrategies for potential climate changes and mitigation measures for the medium and long \n\nterm; 11) Identify possible changes in the quality and quantity of water resources resulting \n\nfrom the conservation actions of the Water Producer/PCJ project; 12) Strengthen institutional \n\narrangements in PES projects undertaken in the River Basin Committee.  \n\nOur study consists of a new freshwater monitoring proposal with variables that can be \n\nquantified in the flow and load duration curves. Advancing the monitoring of Water-PES \n\nprojects contributes toward consolidating the Brazilian information system on water \n\nresources, improving hydrologic models and updating the integrated environmental \n\nassessment. Besides, the hydrological monitoring here proposed can help obtaining short- \n\nand, if continuously applyied, long-term evidence of Water-PES project performance. \n\nEstimate project or program performance is a scientific guideline for Water-PES, linked to \n\necological sustainability principle for ensures project durability, according to Naeem et al. \n\n(2015). As a result, the real sustainability of ecosystem services can be better assessed and \n\nvalued in the long term.  \n\n3.6.

This article presents results from a multi-site, nested catchment \n\nexperiment carried out during a dry period in the Cantareira Water Supply System, South-East \n\nBrazil, linking quali-quantitative freshwater monitoring to land-use/land-cover change. \n\nResults from 17 catchments show regional behaviour for nitrate loads and drainage areas \n\n(0.66-925 km2). An inverse correlation between forest cover and water yield was observed. \n\nDespite forest growth in spatial extent, nutrient loads showed potential hazards for water \n\nsecurity.  \n\n \n\n \n\nKey words: Water availability, Freshwater monitoring, Drought, Land-use/land-cover \n\nchange, Brazil \n\n  \n\n\n\n68 \n \n\n \n  \n\n4.1 Introduction \n\nRivers provide goods and services linked to the flow dynamics and the interaction \n\nbetween flow and landscape. These sustain the integrity of the ecosystems. However, land-use \n\nchanges such as urbanization, industrial development, deforestation and intensive agriculture \n\nwith rapid population growth and climate change threaten the supply of safe drinking water \n\nand ecological integrity. These changes lead to risks of potential water crisis with impacts on \n\nvulnerable ecosystems and people (Tundisi &amp; Tundisi, 2015; Gordon et al., 2008).  \n\nThe International Hydrological Programme of UNESCO defined water security as the \n\n\u201ccapacity \u00a0 to \u00a0 guarantee \u00a0 drinking \u00a0 water \u00a0 access \u00a0 in \u00a0 acceptable \u00a0 conditions \u00a0 of \u00a0 quality \u00a0 and \u00a0 quantity, \u00a0\n\nfor \u00a0 sustaining \u00a0 human \u00a0 and \u00a0 ecosystem \u00a0 health\u201d \u00a0 (UNESCO, \u00a0 2012). \u00a0 Therefore, \u00a0 water security is an \n\ninterdisciplinary and multidimensional concept to assess the tolerable level of water-related \n\nrisks to society (Bakker, 2012). Water security encompasses a variety of multipurpose water \n\nresources (Pahl-Wostl, 2015; Sivapalan et al., 2014), for both consumptive and \n\nnonconsumptive uses, which affect sustainability (V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty et al., 2010) and water \n\nallocation (Hellegers &amp; Leflaive, 2015; Hoekstra, 2013). \n\nWater scarcity can impact these basic aspects of water security. Integrating \n\nquantitative, qualitative and seasonal aspects of water security is a crucial topic in river basin \n\nplanning, especially concerning strategic water supply basins. For example, in Brazil the \n\ndecreasing freshwater volumes in rivers, as well as increased water temperatures and elevated \n\nconcentrations of nutrients, have caused frequent cyanobacteria blooms (Tundisi &amp; Tundisi, \n\n2015). In watersheds with marked land-use/land-cover (LULC) change, field monitoring of \n\nboth the quantity and quality of freshwater also under drought conditions is an important input \n\nfor decision making. \n\nIn large countries like Brazil, those uncertainties resulting from water monitoring are \n\ninherent to the biome diversity and territorial extension. For example, the Brazilian Policy on \n\nWater Resources (Law N\u00ba. 9433; Brazil, 1997) determined water security by integrating river \n\nwater quantity with quality and the decentralization of water resources management (Porto &amp; \n\nPorto, 2002). The objectives of the Brazilian water law are to: (i) assess the evolution of water \n\nquality; (ii) identify critical areas of pollution; and (iii) assess the effectiveness of water \n\nresources management. However, there are still large gaps in the water quality, quantity and \n\nseasonal monitoring in Brazil related to ecosystem services (Libanio, 2015; Pagiola, von \n\nGlehn &amp; Taffarello, 2013), especially under climate extremes (Nobre et al., 2016; Marengo et \n\nal., 2015; De Ara\u00fajo et al. 2004). \n\nhttp://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7315/pdf/nature09440.pdf#auth-1\n\n\n69 \n \n\n \n\n4.1.2 Water Supply Programmes and Environmental Conservation \n\nWater yield has been affected by land-use and climate changes, which in turn has \n\nstrained the conservation or restoration of water resources management (Palmer &amp; Filoso, \n\n2009; Arthington et al., 2006). Conservation mechanisms have been recently implemented in \n\nBrazil. There are at least 20 Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) programs in operation in \n\nBrazil (Richards et al., 2015; Pagiola, von Glehn, &amp; Taffarello, 2013), most of them focusing \n\non hydrological services, e.g., improving water quality (by filtering pollutants and/or reducing \n\nsediments) and regulating flow discharge, in the Atlantic Forest biome. \n\nThe watersheds in the Atlantic Forest are a rich source of available water in Brazil. \n\nThis biome has an estimated 8000 endemic plants species and over 650 endemic vertebrates \n\n(Mittermeier et al., 2004) across 1.43 million km2 (Buckley &amp; Pegas, 2014). The headwaters \n\nof these watersheds supply \u00a0 the \u00a0 drinking \u00a0 water \u00a0 to \u00a0 more \u00a0 than \u00a0 a \u00a0 half \u00a0 of \u00a0 the \u00a0 Brazil\u2019s \u00a0 population \u00a0 - \n\n122 million people (Rodrigues, Brancalion, &amp; Isernhagen, 2009) - and produce 62% of \n\nBrazilian electricity (Joly, Metzger, &amp; Tabarelli, 2014). The Brazilian Atlantic Forest has \n\nbeen protected by law since 2006, but less than 7% of its original coverage remains, which, \n\nadded to secondary forests and fragments of less than 100 ha, results in 11.4% - 16% of cover \n\n(Ribeiro, Metzger, Martensen, Ponzoni &amp; Hirota, 2009). The fragmentation has led to some \n\nregions \u00a0 of \u00a0 this \u00a0 forest\u2019s \u00a0 biodiversity \u00a0 being very threatened. One of them is the part of the \n\nMantiqueira Mountains where the Cantareira Water Supply System (hereafter referred as the \n\nCantareira System), the area of our study, is located. Despite the legal protection, more than \n\n73% of protected areas in the Cantareira System are under anthropic occupations (Whately &amp; \n\nCunha, 2007). Social and economic conflicts have arisen among the different water users. \n\nConservation programmes are necessary not only for water and biodiversity (Joly et al., \n\n2014), but are also for the restoration of this unique biome (Rodrigues et al., 2009; Banks-\n\nLeite et al., 2014).  \n\nA pioneering Brazilian example of payment for watershed services is the Water \n\nProducer/PCJ (Produtor de \u00c1gua/Piracicaba, Capivari and Jundia\u00ed) project. This PES project \n\nhas been encouraging forest restoration and conservation, as well as soil conservation, in rural \n\nprivate properties since 2009. As of mid-2015, 320 ha of forests was conserved, 68 ha of \n\nprotected areas was restored and 100 ha of soils was conserved through more than 40 \n\ncontracts signed in the Cancan and Moinho watersheds, representing 5% of the total basin \n\nareas. The resources for the PES are provided by charges for the use of water resources \n\n(Taffarello, Calijuri, Viani, Marengo, &amp; Mendiondo, 2015), instead of fees (since the charge \n\nfor water use in Brazil is set as a public price). This procedure reflects the direct application \n\n\n\n70 \n \n\n \n  \n\nof \u00a0 the \u00a0 \u2018user-pays \u00a0 principle\u2019 \u00a0 and \u00a0 the \u2018provider-recipient concept\u2019 and its negative and positive \n\nexternalities, respectively. \n\nThe Water Producer/PCJ project began hydrological monitoring in 2013 through a \n\npartnership with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), governmental secretaries and \n\nuniversities. This monitoring will potentially attract new investments on account of greater \n\nconfidence in the project (Naeem et al., 2015). But some water security questions related to \n\nthe Water Producer PCJ project still remain, such as: (1) are the actions of PES programmes \n\nenough to improve and maintain water quality in critical headwaters?; and (2) how could \n\ndischarge measurements in the field help optimize novel monitoring &amp; early-warning \n\nhydrologic cycle strategies? \n\n4.1.3 The 2013-14 drought in South-East Brazil \n\nWater security is intrinsically related to the adaptive capacity of a society with respect \n\nto water extremes, especially in anticipating periods of water scarcity and droughts. However, \n\ndrought prediction models are still highly conditioned to the inherent uncertainty of observed \n\nvariables and methods of estimation (Underwood, 2015). In addition, non-stationary \n\nconditions of existing temperature and rainfall records incorporate new challenges to water \n\nsystems under risks (Borgomeo et al., 2014).  \n\nTrends in South American total rainfall and rainfall extremes and links with sea \n\nsurface temperature were assessed for the period 1960-2000 by Haylock et al. (2006). \n\nLikewise, the IPCC AR5 WG2 (Magrin et al., 2014) showed that South America is vulnerable \n\nto climate change. Phillips et al. (2009) reported the loss of above-ground biomass carbon as a \n\nrelevant impact of the severe 2005 drought that occurred in the Amazon forest. Changes in the \n\nfrequency, intensity, spatial extent or duration of weather and climate extremes can result in \n\nextremes of river regimes (De Ara\u00fajo et al., 2004). Thus, new drought index or methods were \n\nproposed by some authors (De Ara\u00fajo &amp; Bronstert, 2016; Cook et al., 2015; Gonz\u00e1lez &amp; \n\nVald\u00e9s, 2006) for assessing hydrological droughts.  \n\nIn 2013-14, South-East Brazil faced the most intense drought recorded (Escobar, \n\n2015; Porto &amp; Porto, 2014). Moreover, this effect remains to date (The Economist, 2015). \n\nCompared to historical records in South-East Brazil, the Brazilian Meteorology Institute \n\nshowed that the precipitation in January-March 2014 was approximately 54% (300 mm) \n\nlower than the mean values of the 1961-1990 reference period (National Centre of Monitoring \n\n&amp; Early Warning of Natural Disasters [CEMADEN], 2015). Satellite images from the Center \n\nfor \u00a0 Weather \u00a0 Forecasts \u00a0 and \u00a0 Climate \u00a0 Research \u00a0 of \u00a0 Brazil\u2019s \u00a0 National \u00a0 Space \u00a0 Research \u00a0 Institute \u00a0\n\n\n\n71 \n \n\n \n\n(CPTEC/INPE) show that during January and February of 2014 continental vapour clouds \n\nfrom the Amazon failed to carry rain conditions to South-East Brazil.  \n\nOn the one hand, this 2013-14 drought jeopardized the 2015 public supply water \n\nallocations (Escobar, 2015). Besides the impact on 80 million people in Minas Gerais, Sao \n\nPaulo and Rio de Janeiro, the Tiete waterway was disabled during the Brazilian rainy season \n\nin 2014, resulting in the loss of 5,000 jobs and millions of tonnes of un-transported products \n\n(Tundisi &amp; Tundisi, 2015), which shows that the multiple uses of water were affected by this \n\nsevere drought. On the other hand, water withdrawals from reservoirs with very low levels \n\n(Coutinho et al., 2015) also pose problems related to water quality, with the settled sediments, \n\nmetals, microorganisms and macronutrient over-enrichment, mainly phosphorous (Carpenter, \n\n2005), which increase the water treatment costs. Some of the hydro-socio-economic impacts5 \n\nof this drought were a 25% electricity price increase for 62% of Brazilians (Richards et al., \n\n2015), and an expansion of 150% in fire-prone areas, reducing the amount of vegetation cover \n\nin Sao Paulo state. Furthermore, many tourism establishments near reservoirs closed, and \n\nfood prices increased significantly. In short, at least US$ 5 billion was lost in this 2013-14 \n\ndrought in South-East Brazil, which was the fifth most expensive natural disaster worldwide \n\nin 2014 (Munich RE, personal communication, February 02, 2016). \n\nTo reduce the impacts of extreme events, such as severe droughts, hydrologic \n\nmonitoring is needed, integrating meteorological and quali-quantitative variables of \n\nfreshwater, especially in critical areas. Gordon et al. (2008) reported that small areas with \n\nhigh soil phosphorous concentrations and high runoff potential were responsible for most of \n\nthe phosphorus runoff into freshwater. Thus, better water quality could be achieved by \n\nmanaging these critical areas rather than the entire catchment. Moreover, integrating water \n\nquality and water quantity can substantially improve our comprehension of how headwaters \n\ncontribute with nutrient loads to downstream areas, which were responsible for the water \n\nsupply to 15 million people. Nutrient transportation across scales can increase the trophic \n\nstate of the reservoirs and also compromises the multiple uses (as a result of algal blooms and \n\nanoxic events). Especially under extreme events, the empirical relationships between the \n\nLULC and quali-quantity freshwater fluxes at headwater scales allow foreseeing water \n\n                                                 \n\n \n5\u2018Hydro-socio-economic \u00a0impacts\u2019 expresses the negative effects on socio -environment and economy brought by \nthe 2013-14 drought which persisted in South -East Brazil. It was the worst water supply crisis in the Cantareira \nWater Supply System compared to the historical data (Marengo et al., 2015).  This term was adapted from the \n\u2018hydrosocial \u00a0territories\u2019 \u00a0concept \u00a0proposed \u00a0by \u00a0Boelens, Hoogesteger, Swyngedouw, Vos &amp; Wester (2016). \n\n  \n\n\n\n72 \n \n\n \n  \n\nscarcity at downstream scales. Evident correlations between LULC and water yield, as well as \n\nthe respective effects on water quality at headwaters, allow preventing water shortages in \n\ndownstream areas. The main objective of this study is to evaluate freshwater quali-\n\nquantitative monitoring during the Sao Paulo 2013-14 drought at defined spatiotemporal \n\nscales. Thus, the characterization of nutrient loads related to drainage areas was investigated, \n\nas well as water yields in relation to forest cover in nested catchments. The goal is to integrate \n\nshort-term evidences, as the on-field baseline, to boost long-term monitoring at strategic \n\nheadwaters for water supply and environmental conservation. \n\n4.2 Material and Methods \n\n4.2.1 Study area \n\nLocated in South-East Brazil, the Cantareira System, a 2300-km2 catchment drainage \n\narea connected to the 1,000 hm3of reservoirs and with total water demand of 36 m3/s (Water \n\nNational Agency and Sao Paulo State Water and Energy Resource Management Agency \n\n[ANA/DAEE], 2013), was affected by the 2013-2014 drought. Because the Cantareira System \n\nhas a mean residence time of approximately 1 year (CEMADEN, 2015), it failed to fully meet \n\nnot only 45% of water demand of the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPMR) of 9 million \n\ninhabitants (responsible for 20% of Brazilian economy), but also downstream demands of the \n\nCampinas Metropolitan Region, of approximately 5 million inhabitants. Therefore, strategies \n\nfor reducing water consumption are crucial. The headwaters of the Cantareira System drain \n\ninto the Piracicaba River, a tributary of the Tiet\u00ea River, in the left portion of the Parana Basin. \n\nFigure 4.1 shows the sampling points selected for water quality campaigns in 2013-14 among \n\nother catchment outlets, automatically generated from digital elevation modelling (DEM-\n\nASTER), with upstream drainage area above the thresholds of 0.60 km , for the Cachoeira \n\nand Atibainha subbasins, and above 0.75 km2 for the Jaguari and Jacarei subbasins. The \n\nCantareira System is considered a strategic transboundary water system (Ditt et al., 2010). \n\nConsidering the economic and demographic pressures on a megacity, to prevent water \n\nscarcity as a result of the unplanned growth of Sao Paulo Metropolitan Region, the \n\ngovernment began constructing the system in the 1960s (Braga, 2001). As a great example of \n\ngrey infrastructure, the connection of freshwater reservoirs was built in two steps. The first \n\nended in 1975, and the second in 1981 (ANA, 2006). Its headwaters form three main river \n\nbasins, the Jaguari-Jacare\u00ed, Cachoeira and Atibainha, with drainage areas within Cantareira \n\nSystem of 1230, 392, and 315 km2, respectively (Whately &amp; Cunha, 2007).  \n\n\n\n73 \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure  4.1. Monitoring points (open circles) during the 2013-14 period plotted with outlets of \nheadwaters of the Cantareira Water Supply System. \n\n \n\nAccording \u00a0 to \u00a0 K\u00f6ppen\u2019s \u00a0 climate \u00a0 classification, \u00a0 the \u00a0 local \u00a0 climate \u00a0 is \u00a0 the \u00a0 Cwb-type, high-\n\naltitude subtropical climate, with dry winters and regular summers. The region of the PCJ has \n\nfour major geological domains: the crystalline foundation, sedimentary rocks, the effusive \n\n\n\n74 \n \n\n \n  \n\nrocks and the sedimentary covers. Geological fractures encompass mainly NE-SW directions. \n\nBut the Jaguari River is constrained by an average geologic fracture in the E-W direction. \n\nThese features contribute to the erosion process by increasing the gap between the drains and \n\nthe top of the slopes, facilitating the occurrence of landslides by sheet erosion (Piracicaba, \n\nCapivari and Jundia\u00ed River Basin Committes [PCJ], 2011). \n\nThe topography of the region is dominated by the moderate-to-high slopes from the \n\nMantiqueira Mountains, with elevated valleys at altitudes between 800 and 2054 m.a.s.l. The \n\nheadwaters of the Cantareira System (Figure 4.1) are located between coordinates 46o30\u2019W, \n22o35\u2019S \u00a0and \u00a045o50\u2019W, 23o05\u2019S, \u00a0in \u00a0the \u00a0states of Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo. The vegetation is \n\ncomposed of remnants of the Atlantic Rainforest Biome, mentioned earlier, with mean annual \n\nprecipitation of 1620-1737 mm (adapted from ANA/DAEE, 2013). Between October 2013 \n\nand May 2014 this region was characterized by wet summers, and the average precipitation \n\nwas 870 mm (CEMADEN, 2015) in the city of Extrema (MG), the geographic center of \n\nJaguari-Jacare\u00ed, which is the largest basin of the Cantareira System, where the PES has been \n\nestablished for a decade. Comparing the three river basins, more gauge stations were found in \n\nthe Jaguari-Jacare\u00ed sub-basin, which could be a consequence of the favourable institutional \n\ncontext of Extrema (Richards et al., 2015). \n\nIn terms of pedology, there are associations of soils with humic-alic and dystrophic \n\nred-yellow oxisols (red yellow latosol) with A-horizons, with a high percentage of clay at \n\nmoderate-to-higher slopes. The soil classes identified by Oliveira et al. (2012) in the Salto \n\ncatchment (Extrema municipality, MG) are orthents, fluvents, inceptisols and red-yellow \n\noxisols (Brazilian Corporation of Agricultural Research [EMBRAPA], 2006). The \n\ncompactness coefficient of the soil of the region indicates, under normal rain conditions, the \n\ntendency for large floods.  \n\nPast LULC changes are reported based on the Instituto Socioambiental [ISA] surveys \n\nconducted in 1989, 1999, 2003 and 2010. The LULC conversion from 1989 to 2010 can be \n\nsummarized as follows. Dispersed urban settlements remained with the same land-use cover, \n\nearly/middle stages of secondary vegetation increased from 4.6% to 7.4%, and livestock areas \n\ndropped from 58.8% to 46.2%; otherwise, reforestation increased from 19.6% to \n\napproximately 30%, and advanced secondary succession or primary vegetation remained the \n\nsame, which was of approximately 15.4% (ISA, 2011). \n\nResolution N\u00ba. 357/2005 of the Brazilian National Environmental Council \u2013 \n\nCONAMA (Brazil, \u00a0 2005) \u00a0 classifies \u00a0 as \u00a0 freshwater \u00a0 \u201cClass \u00a0 1\u201d \u00a0 the \u00a0 protection \u00a0 of \u00a0 aquatic \u00a0\n\n\n\n75 \n \n\n \n\ncommunities, according to the water quality necessary for the main uses, and which after \n\nsimplified treatment, can be directed to the public supply and other uses. Also, the Sao Paulo \n\ndecree N\u00ba 8486/1976 \u00a0 (Sao \u00a0 Paulo, \u00a0 1976) \u00a0 considers \u00a0as \u00a0\u201cClass \u00a01\u201d \u00a0the \u00a0water \u00a0for \u00a0domestic \u00a0supply \u00a0\n\nwithout previous treatment or with only with simple disinfection.  The Sao Paulo State Decree \n\nN\u00ba 10755/1977 \u00a0 classified \u00a0 as \u00a0 \u201cClass \u00a0 1\u201d: \u00a0 (1) \u00a0 the \u00a0 Atibainha \u00a0 and \u00a0 Cachoeira \u00a0 rivers \u00a0 and \u00a0 all \u00a0 their \u00a0\n\ntributaries upstream of the respective Cantareira System reservoirs; and (2) the Jaguari river \n\nand all its tributaries upstream of the confluence with the Jacare\u00ed river at the municipality of \n\nBragan\u00e7a Paulista (SP). \n\n4.2.2 Nested Catchment Experiment \n\nExploratory nested catchment experiment (NCE) field campaigns identified river \n\ncross-sections of the highest interest for future installation of gauging stations. Based on \n\nLULC, hydrologic monitoring points were chosen at the main tributaries of Jaguari-Jacarei, \n\nCachoeira and Atibainha using a Nested Catchment Experiment (NCE) methodology (Figure \n\n4.1, Table 4.1). NCE helps to understand the hydrologic process (McDonnell et al., 2007) and \nto define the hydrologic controls on non-point pollution transport (Scanlon et al., 2004). \n\nExploratory NCE field campaigns to identify river cross-sections for future installation of \n\ngauging stations and systematic NCE field campaigns addressed both qualitative and \n\nquantitative river measurements. We performed two exploratory field campaigns to identify \n\nand select sampling sites, considering: (1) the scales in which changes in land use had a \n\nsufficient footprint to yield impacts within a short time frame; (2) the comparison between \n\npaired watersheds, i.e., reference versus intervention ones; and (3) safety and accessibility \n\nconditions. Accordingly, we planned four systematic campaigns (Table 4.1) following \n\nseasonal patterns and according to WMO (2010) guidelines to verify whether there are \n\ndiscrepancies between different seasons and to show the seasonal behaviour of quali-\n\nquantitative river flow variables.  \n\nDespite the distance between the sampling sites, they are in the same river basin \n\n(Piracicaba River). Moreover, they are at the same latitude (between -23.2\u00ba and -22.8\u00ba), and \n\nthus subjected to the same climatic conditions. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n76 \n \n\n \n  \n\nTable 4.1.Nested Catchment Experiment (NCE) of quali-quantitative river flow variables. \n\nNCE  N Period P \n(mm) \n\nAPI \n(mm) \n\nTair \n(oC) \n\nTwat er \n(oC) \n\n1  17 23-25 Oct. 2013 0.0  117.9  20.4 \n(17.1, 26.5) \n\n19.8 \n(18.8, 20.6) \n\n2  17 3-5Dec. 2013 35.3 123.7 20.9 \n(14.6, 27.8) \n\n21.0 \n(19.8, 23.3) \n\n3  17 14-15 March 2014 0.0 114.6  21.8 \n(17.4, 26.4) \n\n20.8 \n(20.2, 21.3) \n\n4  17 23-25 May 2014  1.3    32.5 15.5 \n(13.4, 19.4) \n\n16.7 \n(16.0, 17.3) \n\nNote.

The 17 NCE sites indirectly receive non-point pollution from urban \n\nareas of Itapeva-MG, Camanducaia-MG, Extrema-MG, Joan\u00f3polis-SP and Nazar\u00e9 Paulista-\n\nSP cities, with a total population of 76,251 inhabitants (Brazilian Institute for Geography and \n\nStatistics [IBGE], 2014), and an average population growth of +2.2 %/y. \n\nOf these six field campaigns, the highest API-15d (123.7 mm) was in December 2013. \n\nConsidering only systematic NCE campaigns, the minimum API (32.5mm) was in May 2014. \n\nMean air daily temperature during field campaigns varied from 15.5 to 21.8 \u00baC, but with \n\ntemperature intervals between daily minima and daily maxima ranging from 13.4 to 27.8 \u00baC \n\n(Figure 4.2).  \n\nBecause these campaigns were carried out in October/2013, December/2013, \n\nJanuary/2014 and May/2014, water and air temperatures are expected to change. When \n\nrainfall was lower, air and water temperatures were different due to lower evaporation. \n\nInstead, due to higher evaporation the air and water temperature values are closer because of \n\nprecipitation.

A metal wading rod was used to measure shallow-depth waters; for deeper \n\ncross-sections, a propeller current meter with rotation counter installed on an aluminium boat \n\nfixed to a meter-graduated steel wire was used (WMO, 2010). For all measurements, \n\ninstantaneous velocities were sampled to assess the mean cross-sectional velocity and flow \n\ndischarge. On average, all river cross-sections were sampled with observed velocity profiles \n\nseparated by a distance of approximately 25 cm from each other; this strategy assured \n\nassessing the representative mean velocity at the cross-sections. Sampled observations were \n\ndouble-checked, either in the field or in the lab. Flow-discharge observations followed the \n\nWMO (2010). In addition, graduated river stages were installed with topographic references \n\nrelated to mean sea level. \n\n4.2.4 Water quality monitoring \n\nFor an overview of the contributing watersheds and to help understand runoff \n\nprocesses, a general water quality characterization was performed to demonstrate the situation \n\nof the river during the experiments. This procedure is meant to improve the development of \n\n\n\n78 \n \n\n \n  \n\nwater resources management policies and to calibrate a predictive model through the \n\nmeasurement of some parameters co-located with discharge gauging, since the loadings \n\nestimates are a requirement for the study objectives. \n\nThus, at all 17 river cross-sections we analysed instantaneous water quality variables \n\nof hydrogenionic potential (pH), water temperature, electrical conductivity, turbidity, \n\nBiological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), total solids (TS), \n\nNO3, NO2, PO4, thermotolerant coliforms and Escherichia coli. The observed variables were \n\nanalyzed following the American Public Health Association [APHA] (Rice, Baird, Eaton, &amp; \n\nClesceri, 2012).  The pH was estimated in the lab through APHA 40500 \u00a0 H+-B \u00a0 Electrometric \u00a0\n\nmethod, \u00a0 electrical \u00a0 conductivity \u00a0 (EC, \u00a0 in \u00a0 \u00b5mho/cmunits) \u00a0 was \u00a0 performed \u00a0 with \u00a0 APHA \u00a0 2510 \u00a0 B, \u00a0\n\nand \u00a0 turbidity \u00a0 (in \u00a0 NTU \u00a0 units) \u00a0 using \u00a0 the \u00a0APHA \u00a0 2130 \u00a0 B \u00a0 method. \u00a0 In \u00a0 turn, \u00a0 the \u00a0 COD \u00a0 (in \u00a0 mgO2/L) \u00a0\n\nand \u00a0 the \u00a0 BOD \u00a0 (inmgO2/L) \u00a0 were \u00a0 estimated \u00a0 through, \u00a0 respectively, \u00a0 APHA \u00a0 5220 D\u2013colorimetric \n\nand 5210 B \u2013 5-day BOD Test methods. TS (in mg/L) were assessed by APHA 2540B \n\nmethod. \n\nRegarding Nitrogen and Phosphorus loads, Total Nitrogen  was evaluated through \n\nAPHA 4500 NB (Macro Kjeldahl), N-NO3 (nitrate,in \u00a0 mg/L)  by APHA 4500 NO3\u2014B \n\n(Spectrophotometric Method), N-NO2 (nitrite, in \u00a0 mg/L) through APHA 4500 NO2-B \n\n(colorimetric method), N-NH3 (ammonia,in \u00a0 mg/L) through 4500 NH3-C, and P-PO4 \n\n(phosphate, in \u00a0 mg/L) through APHA-4500 P-E (ascorbic acid). Finally, thermotolerant \n\ncoliforms (colony-forming units, CFU/100 mL) and E. coli (CFU/100 mL) were evaluated \n\nusing APHA 9223B (substrate enzyme test). In the depuration process of water bodies, \n\nfreshwater monitoring is fundamental to understand pollutant concentration changes \n\nthroughout the year in line with the seasons (Bottino et al., 2010).  \n\n \n\n4.3 Results \n\n4.3.1 Land-use and land-cover change at experimental catchments \n\nTable 4.2 shows four systematic field campaigns at river cross-sections using NCE. It \n\nalso shows the respective recorded land-use and land-cover (LULC) data for the areas, \n\nupslope of NCE river cross-section, at Cantareira System headwaters. Table 4.2 shows the \nfeatures of sampled NCE sites. All 17 experimental sites have average river bed slopes \n\nranging from 0.24% to 1.18%, with sinuosity >1.2, entrenchment ratios of cross-sections > \n\n\n\n79 \n \n\n \n\n1.4, with transitional sandy-gravel bedslopes, and width-to-depth ratios from 1.5 to over 4.8 \n\n(Rosgen &amp; Silvey, 1998).  \n\nThe main LULC in the river basins was classified in three main mixing uses and \n\ncover: sparse human settlement and/or urban areas (Settl.), open mixed areas for cattle and \n\nrange (Range), and mixed natural forests, and/or riparian forests and/or reforestation (Forest). \n\nRiparian vegetation is densely occupied by a mixture of endemic hydromorphic species, co-\n\nexisting with many exotic species, such as Eucalyptus sp. and Bambusoideae sp. The \n\nmonitoring points (Table 4.2) were located at the headwaters of the main tributaries of \nCantareira System reservoirs - three at Atibainha Basin (ATI), seven at Cachoeira Basin \n\n(CAC) and seven at Jaguari Basin (JAG). \n\nTable 2 also shows two columns to the right: the forest LULC growth between 1989 \n\nand 2010 and the rate class called LULC. In summary, the table shows an average LULC \n\nforest growth in spatial extent of 42.7% between 1989 and 2010. The last column is composed \n\nof five fields. The first three fields show the categorical growth of the three main LULC, in \n\nthe period 1989-2010, for settlement, range and forest, respectively. The fourth field of this \n\ncode \u00a0 represents \u00a0 the \u00a0 Horton\u2019s \u00a0 geomorphological \u00a0 order \u00a0 at \u00a0 the \u00a0 NCE;? \u201c\u2020\u201dmeans that the \n\nexperimental NCE drains directly into the reservoir, and is not connected to the main stem of \n\nthe river tributary. \u00a0 The \u00a0 fifth \u00a0 (last) \u00a0 field \u00a0 represents \u00a0 whether \u00a0 Horton\u2019s \u00a0 order \u00a0 at \u00a0 the \u00a0 NCE \u00a0 point \u00a0 is \u00a0\n\nequal \u00a0 to \u00a0 (\u201c=\u201d) \u00a0 or \u00a0 higher \u00a0 than \u00a0 (\u201c>\u201d) \u00a0 Horton\u2019s \u00a0 order \u00a0 of \u00a0 the \u00a0 upstream \u00a0 NCE, \u00a0 when \u00a0 there \u00a0 is \u00a0 an \u00a0\n\nupstream \u00a0 NCE. \u00a0 In \u00a0 that \u00a0 fifth \u00a0 field, \u00a0 symbol \u00a0 \u201c\u2021\u201dmeans that incremental area, upstream of the \n\nNCE point, equals the total drainage area (there is no upstream NCE).  \n\nFor example, for site N\u00ba 16 (Reference Moinho in Table 4.2), \u00a0 the \u00a0 code \u00a0 \u20180/\u00b1/1/\u2021\u2019 \u00a0\n\nmeans a field evidence collected at a NCE river cross-section with an adjacent draining area \n\nwith no-change \u00a0 (0%) \u00a0 in \u00a0 LULC \u00a0 human \u00a0 settlement, \u00a0 with \u00a0 positive \u00a0 (\u201c+\u201d) \u00a0 growth \u00a0 of \u00a0 LULC \u00a0 range \u00a0\n\nareas and, \u00a0 likewise, \u00a0 with \u00a0 negative \u00a0 (\u201c-\u201d) growth of LULC forest areas. Furthermore, the last \n\ncolumn of Table 4.2 is underlined when the catchment has positive LULC forest. \n\nNine (9) river cross-sections were characterized with LULC of the adjacent area \n\nequalled \u00a0 to \u00a0 the \u00a0 total \u00a0 drainage \u00a0 area \u00a0 (depicted \u00a0 with \u00a0 symbol \u00a0 \u201c\u2021\u201d, \u00a0 Table 4.2). The other eight (8) \nriver cross sections have LULC related to the upslope incremental catchment, between two \n\nsampling points. According to digital elevation modelling, six river cross sections were \n\nsurveyed \u00a0as \u00a0Horton\u2019s \u00a01st-order basins, three as 2nd-order, one as 3rd-order, five as 4t h-order and \n\ntwo as 5t h-order. \u00a0 Horton\u2019s \u00a0 1st-order drainage areas ranged from 0.66 to 11.9 km2, and also \n\nHorton\u2019s \u00a0 5t h-order which ranged from 289 to 925 km2. \n\nhttp://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambusoideae\n\n\n80 \n \n\n \n  \n\nTable 4.2.

Observed seasonal water yield of catchments ranged between 5% and \n\n18% of accumulated precipitation for the period of October 2013 to May 2014, thereby \n\ndifferentiating two catchment groups (Figure 4.3 and Figure 4.4).  On the one hand, some \n\ncatchments had higher water yields: the Cancan-Intervention catchment (A=2.01km2, with \n\nwater yield of 146 mm), the three main sub-basins together draining into the reservoirs \n\n(A=1940 km2, water yield of 151mm) and the JAG System (A=1234km2, with water yield of \n\n141mm), with authorized water withdrawal of 13mm/year (ANA/DAEE, 2014).  \n\nOn the other hand, three other catchments had lower water yields: the Cancan-\n\nReference catchment (A=1.26km2, with water yield of 74mm), CAC system (A=393km2, with \n\nforest land use cover of 60%, water yield of 59 mm) and ATI system (A=313km2, with forest \n\nland use cover of 71% (Pereira &amp;Teixeira Filho, 2009), water yield of 41mm). In general, \n\nFigure 4.4 shows that the experimental results had an inverse relationship between water yield \nand forestry cover in the catchment areas. \n\n \nFigure 4.3.

Part of these data was used as input and \n\nfor calibration of the ecohydrologic model performed in scenarios simulations (see Chapter 5 \n\nof this thesis).  \n\nThe median sampled pH was 6.9, with a sample mean of 6.9\u00b10.2. Median electrical \n\nconductivity (EC) for all sampled data was 41.0 \u00b5mho/cm (42.0 r 21.6 \u00b5S/cm), ranging \n\nbetween a minimum of 13.0 \u00b5S/cm and a maximum of 133.9 \u00b5S/cm. The former minimum \n\nvalue was related to highly-oxygenated headwaters, i.e., Cachoeira dos Pretos, with a \n\ndrainage area of 101.4 km2, during the rainy periods in December 2013. Conversely, the \n\nlowest electrical conductivity was seen at Posses Outlet, with drainage area of 11.9 km2, with \n\nsignificant interference of farm-to-urban conversion, which influenced the river water quality. \n\n\n\n83 \n \n\n \n\nThe median BOD was 2.0 mgO2/L, with means of 2.4 r1.8 mgO2/L, and a narrow range \n\nbetween 1.0 to 6.0 mgO2/L. Factors such as turbulence, metal toxicity, organic compounds \n\nand nitrogen can influence BOD results.  \n\nFigure 4.5 summarizes the observed water quality variables for the period October \n\n2013 to May 2014 at tributaries of the Jaguari, Cachoeira and Atibainha sub-basins. For \n\nexample, median COD was 16.0 mgO2/L, with a mean of 19.0 mg O2/L, and a maximum of \n\n98.0 mg O2/L for the Atibainha sub-basin (drainage area of 1,642 km2).  \n\nFor all experiment surveys, the median TS was 45 mg/L, with a maximum of 305 \n\nmg/L at Parque de Eventos, with drainage area of 925 km2, and an estimated TS load of 215 \n\nt/km2 per year.  \n\nIn terms of total coliforms, the median value was of 65,000 colony-forming units \n\n(CFU/100 mL), with high variability. For example, the total range of thermotolerant coliforms \n\nranged between 14.0 (Cachoeira Outlet, 289 km2) and 9.6u105 CFU/100mL (Parque de \n\nEventos, drainage area of 925 km2). The sampled water data show that no cluster from flow \n\ndischarges versus water quality concentration can be inferred. For example, in Figure 4.5, \n\nonly two intervals of observed flow discharges were surveyed during the field campaigns, i.e., \n\n0.06 \u00a0? \u00a0Q ? \u00a00.14 \u00a0and \u00a00.8 \u00a0? \u00a0Q ? \u00a020.1 \u00a0m3/s. \n \n\n \nFigure 4.5.

The lower specific phosphate load, the pollutant load per drainage \n\narea, was found for site 9 (Domithildes, Reference Cancan area), in Figure 4.1, with 0.027 kg \n\nP-PO4-3/ha per year, and the highest load was for site 7 (Jaguari, Parque de Eventos), in \n\nFigure 4.1, with 2.397 P-PO4-3 /ha per year. \nFigure 4.6 shows that there is not enough evidence to regionalize empirical P-PO4-3 \n\nconcentration and flow discharges.

Figure 4.8 shows there is \nnot enough evidence to regionalize empirical N-NO3-2 concentration and flow discharges. \n\nHowever, for nitrate, the highest load was found in May/2014 (Figure 4.9). The median \nconcentration of nitrate in May/2014 was 1.68mg/L. This result was 14 times as high as the \n\nN-NO3 concentration in October 2013, 10 times that found in December 2013 and 6 times \n\nthan that found in March 2014. \n\n \nFigure 4.8. Experimental evidence of nitrate concentrations versus observed flow at 17 nested \ncatchment experiments in the Cantareira System.  \n\n\n\n87 \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.9. Experimental evidence of discharge seasonal nitrate load variability related to \ndrainage area at 17 nested catchment experiments in the Cantareira System. \n\n \n\nConsidering both phosphate and nitrate loads, based on Figures 4.7 and 4.9, equations \n\nwere developed to find the expected load for phosphate and nitrate corresponding to each \n\ndrainage area from the 17 experimental sites (Table 4.3). Among them, the findings for \n\nnitrate are highlighted, where R2 between 94% and 95% was achieved in most of the seasonal \n\nassessments. \n\n \n\n4.4. Discussion \n\nDiscussion of the results from the field campaigns is presented in the following \n\nparagraphs. Also discussed are the effects of some water pollutants, the water quantity and \n\nquality impacts, and water challenges. \n\n4.4.1. Water quantity &amp; quality monitoring \n\nIn each of the campaigns described in Table 4.1, quality and quantity evaluations were \nperformed at 17 sites. The main differences in the results were related to uncontrolled \n\npatterns, such as precipitation occurrence among field campaigns. The greatest difference is \n\nrelated to the fourth field campaign, showing lower API (32.5 mm, which represents 33.4% of \n\nthe mean API) resulting from the more intense drought conditions. The findings are \n\n\n\n88 \n \n\n \n  \n\ncomparable because (1) the sample sites were at the same river basin and at the same latitude, \n\nand thus subjected to the same climatic conditions; (2) they resulted from rainfall-runoff \n\ntransformation effects; and (3) the state of the land-use cover within the experimental \n\ncatchments.  \n\nLULC changes are relevant factors that impact quality, quantity and seasonal aspects \n\nof water resources. Concerning water quantity, the results showed an inverse relationship \n\nbetween water yield and forest cover in the catchments (Figure 4.4), which confirms previous \n\nstudies (Germer et al., 2009; Pereira &amp; Teixeira Filho, 2009). However, Ellison, Futter &amp; \n\nBishop (2012) highlighted that more forested catchment reducing water availability and \n\nprecipitation can be easily notable at local scales. Small catchments can receive precipitation \n\nfrom other areas. Thus, the consequence of deforestation, less evapotranspiration and less \n\nprecipitation can be clearly seen at larger spatial scales. At regional scales, forest\u2013water \n\nrelationships play a key role in providing the atmospheric vapour that becomes precipitation. \n\nIn short, forest cover and its impact on water yield depend on the catchment scale; thus, this \n\nissue should be placed under scrutiny. Thus, we recommend caution with regard to \n\ngeneralizing our results because they were sampled during a rainfall anomaly season (see \n\nMarengo et al., 2015). \n\nThe presented procedure, which integrates water quality, quantity and meteorological \n\nvariables, provides some contributions for preventing repetition of the 2013-14 drought. First, \n\nwe developed an integrated monitoring network at different spatial scales, and, using \n\nmeteorological, qualitative and quantitative freshwater variables, an additional early-warning \n\nsystem was addressed. Previous to this drought, the integration of qualitative and quantitative \n\naspects of water resources seldom occurred in Cantareira headwaters. Second, this integrated \n\nmonitoring helped the management capacity regarding the drought conditions. For example, \n\nthe reaction of Brazilian water managers regarding drought evidences was water demand and \n\navailability control. On 5 March 2014, the Brazilian National Water Agency [ANA] and the \n\nSao Paulo Department of Water and Electricity [DAEE] released the Resolution N\u00ba 335 to \n\nregulate new patterns of water withdrawals from the Cantareira reservoirs of Jaguari-Jacare\u00ed, \n\nCachoeira and Atibainha (ANA, 2016). Third, our field work in 2013-14 motivated a strategy \n\nchange concerning the official monitoring system at the headwaters of Cantareira System. \n\nBefore 2013 there were only seven online rain-gauge stations; after 2014 this number \n\nincreased by a factor of six (see CEMADEN, Cantareira System Report, 2015). Furthermore, \n\na significant increase in the number of online water-level stations, local water levels, \n\n\n\n89 \n \n\n \n\nexperimental V-notch weirs, and in situ quali-quantitative flow observations were installed \n\nafter 2014. This shows a resilient strategy in-progress to cope with future risks in these \n\nstrategic river basins to ecosystems and water supply.    \n\nWith regard to water quality, pollutant loads include a combination of natural and \n\nanthropogenic factors due to land use and land cover. Progressive changes in LULC can alter \n\npollutant concentrations and behaviour, reducing biodiversity and increasing uncertainties. \n\nFor example, Magurran (2016) and Newbold et al. (2015) reported that land use caused \n\nspecies richness loss (alpha-diversity loss) and its possible impacts on ecosystem functioning. \n\nAlthough we expected high field observations uncertainties in terms of water quantity \n\nand quality, we found evidence of regional behaviours of loads versus drainage areas (Figure \n4.7 for PO4-3 loads and Figure 4.9 for NO3 loads). Nevertheless, specific loads in kg per day \n\nper km2, for both PO4-3 and NO3, show low empirical correlations. Thus, specific-load curves \n\nper drainage area do not seem appropriate for these sampled data. \nThe threat posed by sediments in the freshwater ecosystems has increased due to \n\nanthropogenic factors. TS deposition contributes towards turbidity, stress behaviour during \n\nthe early stages of natural consolidation of soils deposited under water, and potential impacts \n\nfrom the synergisms between nutrients. We found maximum TS of 305 mg/L at Parque de \n\nEventos - Extrema, with an estimated TS load of 215 t/km2 per year. In terms of TS, our most \n\npolluted site (among the 17 NCEs) appears to be 2.5 times less polluted than a basin in \n\nAustralia. Bainbridge et al. (2014) reported 530 t/km2 per year in the Burdekin River \n\ncatchment, a dry tropical catchment, in a five-year study period. Although it is a medium-\n\nsized river catchment, the adjacent urban areas of Extrema have affected the river water \n\nquality. In 2014 Extrema had approximately 32,402 inhabitants (IBGE, 2014), with a \n\npopulation growth rate of 3.3 % per year. Other water quality variables also presented \n\nextreme values at the same field site.   \n\nThermotolerant coliforms ranged between 14.0 (Cachoeira Outlet, 289 km2) and 9.6 X \n\n105 CFU/100mL (Parque de Eventos, 925 km2). These results in medium-size drainage areas \n\nare related to impacts of two different conditions, one from urban loads and the other from \n\nauto-depuration processes in rural areas. Some authors (Lyon et al., 2012; Ouyang, Nkedi-\n\nKizza, Wu, Shinde &amp; Huang, 2006) recommend special actions related to the inherent \n\nvariations of real catchments in terms of their characterization. For example, Ouyang et al. \n\n(2006) reported that except for electrical conductivity, the most important parameter to \n\nprovide water quality variation for one season was not important for another season. \n\n \n\n\n\n90 \n \n\n \n  \n\n4.4.2 Variability of P-PO4 loads \n\nThe precipitation in December/2013 (Figure 4.3) may be responsible for the increase \n\nin the pollutant loads carried into the rivers, as was the case for phosphate. Considering the \n\nseasonal variability, the phosphate concentration was the highest in December 2013 (mean \n\n0.18 mg PO4-3/L) in most of the monitoring sites. However, PO4-3 concentration appears to \n\nhave increased in the drainage area of the catchments under study (Figure 4.7). This \n\nbehaviour is addressed by other authors (e.g. Scanlon et al., 2004), who point to the fact that \n\nPO4-3 load transfers increased from headwaters to downstream areas. However, PO 4-3 specific \n\nloads in the drainage area increased in a similar way.  \n\nIn experimental catchments with drainage areas between 66 and 310 ha, specific loads \n\nranged from 8\u00d710-4to 2.8 \u00d710-1 kg P-PO4-3 per km2 per day. These specific loads showed wide \n\nvariability, and apparently related to a combination of factors like LULC, size of drainage \n\narea, antecedent moisture conditions and farm best management practices. On the one hand, \n\nlower specific P-PO4-3 loads at micro-catchments of Cancan and Moinho can be associated \n\nwith the progressive decline of land use cover of native Atlantic rainforest. Additional small \n\npools associated with medium forest cover of 53% (Intervention Moinho) also decreased \n\nspecific P-PO4-3 loads. But when this forest cover dropped to 13%, specific P-PO4-3 loads \n\nincreased (Intervention Cancan). These results may be associated with greater land use cover \n\nof native Atlantic rainforest, forming containment barriers and preventing the direct entry of \n\nsurface runoff into streams. On the other hand, Site 7 (Jaguari-ParqueEventos, 925 km2), \n\nreceiving urban loads from Extrema city, as well as agriculture and industrial wastewater, had \n\nthe highest specific loads, of 7.9 kg P-PO4-3per km2 per day. Scanlon et al. (2004) found that \n\nneither topographic descriptor was found to satisfactorily conform to the concentration-\n\nversus-discharge observations, thereby indicating that local catchment sediment delivery \n\nfactors or in-stream channel processes are likely to be responsible for the observed \n\ndifferences. Although our observed discharge intervals had a gap of mean discharge \n\nmeasurement of 0.1 - 0.8 m3/s, there is still not enough evidence to accomplish a regionalized \n\ncurve or behaviour in terms of P-PO4-3 concentration and discharges, as shown in Figure 4.6.  \n \n\n4.4.3 Variability of N-NO3 loads \n\nConsidering the increasingly dry conditions observed during the months of this study - \n\nwhich persisted and intensified until early 2015 (The Economist, 2015) -, the lower flows led \n\n\n\n91 \n \n\n \n\nto higher concentrations of pollutants and affected the aquatic ecosystem overall. As a result, \n\nthere was a death of 20 tonnes of different fish species in the Piracicaba River in February, \n\n2014 (Marengo et al., 2015). The higher nutrient load level is one of the most threatening \n\nfactors for the biodiversity of native fish. This can be explained by the proliferation of \n\nmicroorganisms in dry conditions, which consume the remaining oxygen in the water.  \n\nThis study found that pollutant loads and drainage areas (0.66-925 km ) have different \n\ncorrelations. Nitrate is more closely related to drainage area than phosphate. Nitrate loads are \n\nhigher than phosphate loads in all field/lab experiments and in all sub-basins. The equations \n\nrelated to the expected phosphate and nitrate loads corresponding to each drainage area \n\n(Table 4.3) led us to highlight our findings for nitrate, where R2 between 94% and 95% was \nachieved in most of the seasonal assessments. \n\nAround 95% of nitrate load variability can be explained by the size of the contribution \n\nor drainage area and vice-versa. The remaining 5% can be explained by other factors that \n\nwere not measured, such as synergism between nitrate and other nutrients, deeper water \n\nlayers, eutrophication, etc. Similar results were found for phosphate in December 2013. This \n\nvery high correlation (95%) can help companies and the government to predict water \n\npollution based on experimental data and improve the goals of the River Basin Plan, in a key \n\nresearch-for-action initiative. For the observations in Table 4.3, the empirical ratio of N-NO3 \nto P-PO4 was very low, ranging from 1.5 (for A=1 km2) to 2.2 (for A= 1000km2).  \n\nIt is known that nitrogen is an essential macronutrient which regulates primary \n\nproduction in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Excess nitrogen has been linked to many \n\nenvironmental concerns, including the disruption of forest ecosystem functions, acidification \n\nof streams, eutrophication, hypoxia and algal blooms. These processes may be some of the \n\nimpacts of recent climate change.  \n\nSince nitrogen is highly reactive and mobile in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, it \n\nalso serves as a surrogate for many contaminants in the water, which is important in \n\nunderstanding the linkages between headwaters and downstream receiving waters.  \n\n \n\n4.5 Conclusions \n\nThe objective of this chapter was to integrate short-term evidence, as the on-field \n\nbaseline, to stimulate long-term monitoring at strategic headwaters constrained by \n\nhydrological extremes. Using evidence from 17 sites through nested catchment experiments \n\n\n\n92 \n \n\n \n  \n\nduring field surveys in the 2013-14 period, characterized by a low-precipitation anomaly in \n\nSouth-East Brazil, the importance is highlighted of an integrated quali-quantitative freshwater \n\nmonitoring in the Cantareira System, one of the main water supply systems in South-East \n\nBrazil. The study findings indicate that: (1) for water quantity, catchments with less forest \n\ncover present higher water yields, suggesting a possible inverse correlation between forest \n\ncover and water yield; (2) for water quality, empirical evidence of loads (phosphate and \n\nnitrate) versus drainage area, as regionalization procedures for rating curves, presented better \n\nrelationships than water quality concentration versus flow discharges; (3) from this \n\nregionalization, 95% of total variance of phosphate and nitrate loads was explained using \n\ndrainage areas as independent variables; and (4) this nutrient migration from headwaters to \n\ndownstream areas could have impacts of load accumulation and eutrophication in water \n\nsupply reservoirs.  \n\nBased on these experimental data, the results could assist decision-making, regarding \n\nactual and new water rights permits for industrial, domestic, farming, energy supply users and \n\nthe environmental needs. A good example of how this procedure can contribute to avoid the \n\naggravation of the water crisis is the Joint Resolution ANA/DAEE N\u00ba 335 of 5 March 2014, \n\nwhich reviewed the operation standards of the three reservoirs, which are downstream of the \n\n17 campaign sites, where the discharge was measured. This reinforces data quality and \n\ndensity, making decision-making more robust. \n\nThe 2013-14 drought in South-East Brazil is a recent example of the urgent need for \n\nenhanced integrated monitoring of water quality and quantity as part of a robust strategy for \n\nachieving water security. Given the impacts of the Sao Paulo water crisis, there is an \n\nincreasing concern over vulnerabilities and impacts on quality, quantity and seasonal aspects \n\nof water resources. Thus, environmental conservation programmes are a possible adaptation \n\nstrategy, by converting land use to environmentally-friendly land cover. This research has the \n\npotential to be applied to other relevant regions in South America which are also facing recent \n\nextreme events, since freshwater monitoring brings an interesting set of primary data. \n\nThrough new and reliable knowledge this study has the potential to improve the River Basin \n\nPlan goals, in a key research-for-action initiative. Moreover, the partnership between \n\nuniversities, NGOs, and federal, regional and local governmental agencies was (and is) \n\nfundamental to stimulate freshwater monitoring, in not only qualitative, but also quantitative \n\nterms, and assess the protection of watersheds. \n\n\n\n93 \n \n\n \n\nFurther research is needed for continuing and expanding long-term monitoring and \n\nearly-warning strategies in critical watersheds, dependent upon the role played by long-term \n\nclimate change and its influence on ecosystem services. Finally, we suggest updating the \n\nBrazilian water quality standards according to more restrictive frameworks for actual water \n\nsecurity. \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nWe are grateful to Regiane Kock de Sousa Lombardi (Nature Conservancy, Brazil) \n\nand Paulo Henrique Pereira (Extrema municipality) for insights in the planning of monitoring; \n\nDr. Paulo Petry (Nature Conservancy, Brazil and USA) for helping in the manuscript revision \n\nand for the barologger\u2019s \u00a0 bought; to Prof. Dr. Davi Gasparini F.

Modeling \nFreshwater Quality Scenarios with Ecosystem-based Adaptation in the Headwaters of \nCantareira Water Supply System, Brazil, Science of The Total Environment, J. Impact \nFactor 3.98, Qualis CAPES A1. \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nFreshwater fluxes are influenced by the volume and quality of water at the headwaters of \nstrategic river basins under change. Although hydrological models provide hypothesis testing \nof complex dynamics occurring at river basin scales, freshwater quality modeling is still \nincipient at many river catchments. In Brazil, approximately only one in twenty modeling \nstudies assesses freshwater nutrients, which limit the policies regarding hydrological \necosystem services. This paper aims to compare freshwater quality scenarios under different \nland-use/land-cover (LULC) change, one of them related to Ecosystem-based Adaptation \n(EbA) approach in subtropical headwaters. Using the spatially semi-distributed SWAT (Soil \nand Water Assessment Tool) model, nitrate and total phosphorous loads were modeled in \nBrazilian subtropical catchments ranging from 7.2 to 1037 km2. Part of these catchments are \neligible areas of the Brazilian PES-programmes Water Producer and Water Conservator in \nthe Cantareira Water Supply System, which until the drought in 2013-15 supplied water to 9 \nmillion people in the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Region. We considered freshwater quality \nmodeling of three LULC scenarios, with no climate change, as: (i) recent past scenario (S1), \nwith the historic LULC records in 1990, (ii) current land use scenario (S2), considered the \nLULC for the period 2010-2015 as the baseline, and (iii) future land use scenario (S2+EbA). \nThe latter scenario proposed forest cover conversion with restoration through EbA in \nprotected areas according to the Basin Plan of the Piracicaba-Capivari-Jundia\u00ed watersheds by \n2035. The three LULC scenarios were tested with the same records of rainfall and \nevapotranspiration observations in 2006-2014, which comprised the occurrence of extreme \ndrought events. We propose a new indicator for hydrologic services assessment related to the \ngrey water footprint (greyWF) and water yield estimated. The Hydrologic Services Indicator \n(HSI), as a non-dimensional factor of comparing water pollution loads (WPL) for referenced \nand non-referenced catchment, composing water pollution levels from nitrate, total \nphosphorus and sediments. On the one hand, leaching simulations of nitrate and total \nphosphorous allowed the regionalization of greyWF at different spatial scales under LULC \nchanges. According to critical threshold of reference catchments, HSI identified basins into \nless sustainable and more sustainable areas. On the other hand, conservation practices \nsimulated through S2+EbA scenario envisaged not only additional, viable best management \npractices, but also preventive decision making at the headwaters of water supply systems.  \n \nKey words: water quality modeling; Ecosystem-based Adaptation; SWAT; grey water \nfootprint; land-use/land-cover change; Brazil. \n\n\n\n100 \n \n\n \n  \n\n5.1. Introduction \n\nThe Basin Plan comprises the main management tool, the planning for sustainable use \n\nof water resources in both spatial and temporal scales. For sustainable water allocation, river \n\nplans are based on accurate data on actual water availability per basin, taking into account \n\nwater \u00a0 needs \u00a0 for \u00a0 humans;? \u00a0 environmental \u00a0 water \u00a0 requirements \u00a0 and \u00a0 the \u00a0 basin\u2019s \u00a0 ability \u00a0 to \u00a0\n\nassimilate pollution (Mekonnen et al., 2015). However, adaptive management options such as \n\nEcosystem-based Adaptation (EbA; see CBD, 2010; BFN/GIZ, 2013) and water footprint \n\n(WF, Hoekstra &amp; Chapagain, 2008) have rarely been incorporated in the Brazilian Basin \n\nPlans. Moreover, integrated quali-quantitative simulations and indicators of human \n\nappropriation of freshwater resources are seldom used in river plans. The WF as an \n\nenvironmental indicator in watershed plans was used in some countries like Spain (Vel\u00e1zquez \n\net al., 2011; Aldaya et al., 2010). In Brazil, recent glossary of terms released by Brazilian \n\nNational Water Agency (ANA, 2015) incorporates the WF concept to support water resources \n\nmanagement.  \n\nThe WF (Mekonnen &amp; Hoekstra, 2015; Hoekstra et al., 2011) measures both the direct \n\nand indirect water use within a river basin. The term water use refers to water withdrawal, as \n\nthe consumptive use of rainwater (the green water footprint) and of surface/groundwater (the \n\nblue water footprint), and water pollution, i.e., the volume of water used to assimilate the \n\npollutant loads (the grey water footprint, GWF, see Chapagain et al. 2006; Hoekstra &amp; \n\nChapagain, 2008; Hoekstra et al., 2011). In addition, the water footprint assessment, proposed \n\nby Hoekstra et al. (2011), encompasses four phases: (1) Setting goals, (2) Accounting, (3) \n\nSustainability assessment, and (4) Response formulation. It is worth noting that WF studies \n\ncan be restricted to one specific activity of these phases or be related to more than one phase. \n\nAt the water footprint response formulation phase, the EbA options, represented by best \n\nmanagement practices (BMP) at the catchment scale, could represent a trade-off on greyWF \n\n(Zaffani et al., 2011; see Chapter 2 of this thesis). The advantage of quantifying the effects of \n\npollution by volume, instead by concentration, is that water pollution can be considered as a \n\ndemand from non-consumptive water uses (Mekonnen &amp; Hoekstra, 2015; Hoekstra &amp; \n\nMekonnen, 2012), in the same measure units, becoming water demand and availability \n\ncomparable.  \n\nIn the context of integrated water resources management associated with land-\n\nuse/land-cover (LULC) change, many existing conflicts over water use could be prevented \n\n(Winemiller et al., 2016; Aldaya et al., 2010; Oki &amp; Kanae, 2006). For example, LULC \n\n\n\n101 \n \n\n \n\ninfluences water quality, which affects the supporting6 and regulating7 ecosystem services \n\n(Mulder et al., 2015; MEA, 2005) and needs to be monitored for adaptive and equitable \n\nmanagement in the river basin scale (Taffarello et al., 2016; Chapter 4 of this thesis).  \n\nIn spite of discussions regard the lack of representativeness of data used in early \n\nstudies with greyWF (Wichelns, 2015; Zhang et al., 2010; Aldaya et al., 2010; Aldaya &amp; \n\nLlamas, 2008), we argue that the greyWF method may account hydrologic services and \n\nprovide a multidisciplinary, qualitative-quantitative integrated and transparent framework for \n\nbetter water policy decisions. Understanding these catchment-scale ecohydrologic processes \n\nrequires not only low-frequency sampling and automated, in situ, high-frequency monitoring \n\n(Viswanathan et al., 2015; Bieroza et al., 2014; Halliday et al., 2012), but also the use of \n\necohydrologic models to protect water quality and quantity.  However, freshwater quality \n\nmodeling, associated with EbA, greyWF and LULC is still incipient in many river \n\ncatchments. In Brazil, approximately only 5% of modeling studies evaluate nutrients into \n\nfreshwater (Bressiani et al., 2015), which limit the policies on regulating ecosystem services. \n\nIn this research, we propose the regulating ecosystem services be addressed by the \n\ngreyWF because it considers the water volume for self-purification of receiving water bodies \n\naffected by pollutants (Zhang et al., 2010). Thus, the hypothesis of this research is: \n\nconservation practices, addressed by BMP or EbA, and other types of land use conversion \n\nwhich impact hydrology and the ecosystem services (Winemiller et al., 2016) in the \n\ncatchment and sub-basin scales. In these scales, the greyWF can evaluate the changes in the \n\nregulating hydrologic services. Among the three water footprint components, in this study we \n\nassessed greyWF for nitrate, total phosphorous and sediments in 20 sub-basins in the \n\nheadwaters of Cantareira Water Supply System. The goal of this study is to compare \n\nfreshwater quality scenarios, one of them related to EbA options through BMP, and to assess \n\nGWF under different LULC changes. This method is addressed through Nested Catchment \n\nExperiments (NCE, see Taffarello et al., 2016a and 2016b, Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 of this \n\nthesis) at a range of scales, from small catchments of 7.7 km2 to medium-size basins of 1200 \n\nkm2 at subtropical headwaters responsible for the water supply of Sao Paulo Metropolitan \n\nRegion (SPMR). This chapter consists of four sections. The first section provides a brief \n\ndescription of the context, gap, hypothesis and our research goals.  The second section \n\n                                                 \n\n \n6Examples of supporting services: nutrient cycling, primary production, and soil formation.  \n7 Examples of regulating services: self-depuration of pollutants, climate regulation, erosion control, flood \natenuations and water borne diseases. \n\n\n\n102 \n \n\n \n  \n\ndescribes the simulation methods used in the watershed scale and development of three LULC \n\nscenarios. We then propose some ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) approaches related to \n\nwater pollution. Finally, we discuss how the grey water footprint for nitrate or total \n\nphosphorous could be an EbA option for improving decision-making and water security in \n\nsubtropical catchments under change. \n\n \n\n5.2. Material and Methods \n\n5.2.1. The case-study area \n\nTwo of the most vulnerable areas in the Brazilian South-East are the Tiet\u00ea and \n\nPiracicaba-Capivari-Jundia\u00ed (PCJ) watersheds, particularly due to its high population (14 \n\nmillion inhabitants), In an attempt to ensure public water supply, the government built the \n\nCantareira System, an inter-basin transfer, in two stages: a) between 1968 and 1974, at the \n\nend of a 35 year period that underwent a severe drought in the Piracicaba watershed, and b) in \n1982, with the inclusion of two additional reservoirs that regularized the increasing rainfall \n\nfrom mid-1970s until 2005 (Zuffo, 2015). \n\nThe study area comprises the part of the Cantareira System that drains into the \n\nPiracicaba river and which is the headwater of the Piracicaba basin (Figure 5.1). This basin is \nlocated in the borderline of the state of Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo. The water supply system \n\nin the Piracicaba watershed consists of three main reservoirs which are provided with water \n\nfrom the Jaguari-Jacarei, Atibainha and Cachoeira watersheds. Their water is directed to three \n\nmain reservoirs named after their water suppliers: the Jaguari-Jacarei, Cachoeira and \n\nAtibainha basins (drainage areas are, respectively, 1230 km , 392 km  and 312 km ). The \n\nJaguari, Cachoeira and Atibainha rivers are the main tributaries of the Piracicaba River Basin, \n\nwhich are tributaries of the Tiete River system, left affluent of the Parana Basin. The \n\nCantareira System consists of two more reservoirs, located closer to the Metropolitan Region \n\nof S\u00e3o Paulo: Paiva Castro and \u00c1guas Claras. These two reservoirs are not part of our study \n\narea. To simplify our simulations, we did not model the flow to the dams (we did not include \n\nthe dams and the complex water transfers). The water from these five reservoirs is crucial for \n\nthe \u00a0 water \u00a0 supply \u00a0 to \u00a0 South \u00a0 America\u2019s \u00a0 biggest \u00a0 city, \u00a0 Sao \u00a0 Paulo, \u00a0 as \u00a0 well \u00a0 as \u00a0 the \u00a0 Metropolitan \u00a0\n\nRegion of Campinas. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n103 \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.1. Location of Cantareira Water Supply System in the Piracicaba and Upper Tiet\u00ea \nwatersheds. \n\n \n\nWith respect to the water quality, the headwaters of the Cantareira System are \n\nclassified \u00a0 as \u00a0 \u201cclass \u00a0 1\u201d \u00a0 for \u00a0 Jacare\u00ed, \u00a0 Cachoeira \u00a0 and \u00a0 Atibainha \u00a0 watersheds, \u00a0 and \u00a0 \u201cclass \u00a0 2\u201d \u00a0 for \u00a0 the \u00a0\n\nJaguari watershed, according to CONAMA Resolution N\u00ba 357/2005 (Brazil, 2005) and Sao \n\nPaulo Decree N\u00ba 8468/1976 (Sao Paulo, 1976), which means that, with the exception of the \n\nJaguari watershed, the others can be used without previous treatment. And regarding the water \n\nvolume, this region has been intensely impacted by a severe and recent drought (Taffarello et \n\nal., 2016; Escobar, 2015; Whately &amp; Lerer, 2015; ANA, 2015; Porto &amp; Porto, 2014). As a \n\nresult of this serious water crisis, the new ruling on the average flow of the transfer limits of \n\nthe Piracicaba watershed to the Upper Tiete watershed was postponed from 2014 to May 2017 \n\n(ANA, 2015).  The Cantareira System is located in the Atlantic Forest biome, considered a \n\nconservation hotspot because of its rich biodiversity. In spite of that, 78% of the original \n\nforest cover of the Cantareira watershed has been deforested over the past 30 years (Zuffo, \n\n2015). In 2014, the native forest cover was 10% in Extrema, 12% in Joan\u00f3polis and 21% in \n\nNazar\u00e9 Paulista (SOS Mata Atl\u00e2ntica/INPE, 2015). To counteract deforestation, some \n\nenvironmental/financial trade-offs have been developed in the Cantareira headwaters for the \n\nprotection of downstream water quality and the regulation of water flows. These are \n\n\n\n104 \n \n\n \n  \n\nEcosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) initiatives, in which rural landowners receive economic \n\nincentives to conserve and/or restore riparian forests and implement soil conservation \n\npractices (see Chapter 3 of this thesis). The first Brazilian EbA approach was the Water \n\nConservator Project, created in 2005, implemented in Extrema, Minas Gerais (Richards et al., \n\n2015; Pereira, 2013). The Cantareira System also has, since 2009, the Water Producer/PCJ \n\n(Guimar\u00e3es, 2013), a pioneer project in the state of Sao Paulo, which promotes: (i) forest \n\nrestoration in permanent preservation areas (PPA); (ii) conservation of remaining forest \n\nfragments; and (iii) soil conservation. As a pilot project, it focuses on providing subsidies to \n\nlarger scale projects (Padovezi et al., 2013). Both projects were established through public-\n\nprivate partnerships, strengthening EbA in Brazil. \n\n \n\n5.2.2. Databases and model \n\nFigure 5.2 shows the spatial data used in this study, which schematizes a greyWF \n\nmethod which was developed and applied to assess the regulating hydrologic services.  The \n\nsimulations were enhanced by model parameterization with qualitative and quantitative \n\nprimary data (Mohor et al., 2015a; Mohor et al., 2015b; Taffarello et al. 2016b). This can \n\nreduce uncertainties of the model, facilitate data interpretation and provide consistent \n\ninformation. We conducted six field campaigns between 2012 and 2014, in partnership with \n\nANA, CPRM, TNC-Brazil, WWF, USP/EESC, and municipalities. We have installed three \n\ndata collection platforms (DCP) in catchments of Posses, Canc\u00e3 and Moinho, and level and \n\npressure sensors in paired sub-basins (i) with high original vegetation cover, and (ii) in basins \n\nthat receive payment for ecosystem services due to participating in the Water Producer/PCJ \n\nproject.  \n\nWorldwide uses of environmental service models are increasing (Posner et al., 2016). \n\nSome examples of ecohydrologic models with progressive applications in Brazilian basins are \n\nSWAT (Bremer et al., 2016; Francesconi et al., 2016; Bressiani et al., 2015), the models \n\nreviewed by de Mello et al. (2016), Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs \n\n(InVEST) (Sharp, 2016; Tallis et al., 2011), and Resource Investment Optimization System \n\n(RIOS) (Vogl et al., 2016). In the hydrological models like Qual 2K, Qual 2E, SWMM, and \n\nSWAT, input data are converted into system\u2019s \u00a0 outputs, with both quantity and quality \n\nvariables, which represent the water balance and water quality conditions. Depending on the \n\ninput data availability, the user determines whether the simulations will be carried out over \n\nannual, monthly, daily, sub-daily time (Boithias et al., 2015), and scheduled time. Since in \n\n\n\n105 \n \n\n \n\nBrazil daily water quality data are limited, and considering the study's objectives, especially \n\nrelated to the dry season (extreme event that persisted for three hydrologic years in the \n\nCantareira), we chose to run in a monthly resolution. Then, the precipitation of 2010 was \n\napplied in the three scenarios.  \n\nThe Soil and Water Assessment Tool - SWAT-TAMU (Arnold et al., 1998; Arnold \n\nand Fohrer, 2005) is a public domain conceptual spatially semi-distributed model, widely \n\nused in ecohydrological and/or agricultural studies at river basin scale (Krysanova &amp; Whyte, \n\n2015; Krysanova &amp; Arnold, 2008). It divides the basin into sub-basins based on an elevation \n\nmap and the sub-basins are further subdivided into Hydrological Response Unit (HRU). Each \n\nHRU represents a specific combination of land use, soil type and slope class within the sub-\n\nbasin. The model includes climatic, hydrological, soil, sediments and vegetation components, \n\ntransport of nutrients, pesticides, bacteria, pathogens, BMP, and climate change in a river \n\nbasin scale (Srinivasan et al., 2014; GASSMAN et al., 2014; Arnold et al., 2012).  \n\nThe international applications of the ecohydrologic SWAT model have expanded. \n\nThere have been at least 2600 published SWAT studies (SWAT Literature Database, mid-\n\n2016), with at least 400 global peer reviewed studies published/year in the last 3 years. \n\nApproximately 100 studies were presented in 2016 SWAT Beijing Conference (SWAT, 2016). \n\nOver 160 studies were presented in the 2015 SWAT Sardinia Conference (SWAT, 2015) and \n\nin the SWAT Purdue Conference, also held in 2015, 118 studies were presented. Of these \n\nstudies, 8% assessed the transport of nutrients in watersheds (SWAT Purdue, Book of \n\nAbstracts, 2015). Researches using SWAT, not only for quantity, but also for water quality \n\nand ecosystem services assessments (Francesconi et al., 2016; Abbaspour et al., 2015; Duku \n\net al., 2015; Dagupatti &amp; Srinivasan, 2015; Gassman et al., 2014) and also as an educational \n\ntool for  \n\ncomparing hydrologic processes (Rajib et al., 2016) have increased in recent years.  \n\nNext, we obtained and organized secondary data from the region upstream of the \n\nJaguari-Jacare\u00ed, Cachoeira and Atibainha reservoirs. We then set up a database originating \n\nfrom several sources: Hidroweb (ANA, 2014); Basic Sanitation Company of the State of Sao \n\nPaulo (SABESP); Integrated Center for Agrometeorology Information (CIIAGRO, 2014); \n\nDepartment of Water and Power (DAEE); National Institute of Meteorology (INMET) from \n\nthe Center for Weather Forecasts and Climate Studies (CPTEC/INPE).  \n\n\n\n106 \n \n\n \n  \n\n \nFigure 5.2. Methodological scheme for assessing hydrologic services based on GWF. \n\n \n\nAnnex-A summarizes all hydrological, pedological, meteorological and land-use data \nused as input for the delineation and characterization of the watersheds. The topographical \n\ndata \u00a0 used \u00a0 was \u00a0 the \u00a0 Digital \u00a0 Elevation \u00a0 Model \u00a0 \u201cASTER \u00a0 Global \u00a0 DEM\u201d, \u00a0 2\u00aa \u00a0 version, \u00a0 30-m \n\n(Tachikawa, et al., 2011), available free of charge at: http://gdex.cr.usgs.gov/gdex/. We \n\nselected the area as defined by UTM coordinates: -22.5833 (north latitude) and -23.333 (south \n\nlatitude); -45.8333 (east longitude) and -46.6667 (west longitude). The depressions of this \n\nDEM were fixed before making it available to users. \n\n5.2.3. Model Set up \n\nThe initial model set-up used the ArcSWAT interface, integrated to ArcGIS 10.0 \n\n(Environmental Systems Research Institute - ESRI, 2010), (ArcSWAT 2012.10.15 in ArcGIS \n\n\n\n107 \n \n\n \n\n10). Simulations of the HRU-based SWAT model were conducted for the 2004\u20132014 period. \n\nThe first 2 years served as a warm-up period for the model to assume realistic initial \n\nconditions. The delimitation of the basin using ArcSWAT requires a drainage area threshold, \n\nand this value is used to outline the sub-basins. We determined the threshold of 710 ha, \n\ndividing the geographical space to represent the 17 sampling sites in the research field as sub-\n\nbasins, adding the three reservoirs, which resulted in 20 sub-basins (Table 5.1). We highlight \n\nthat the basin was designed up to the confluence of the Jaguari and Atibaia Rivers, forming \n\nthe Piracicaba river, to integrate all areas of interest in the same SWAT project.  \n\nThe definition of similar HRU was accomplished using the soil maps of Sao Paulo \n\n(Oliveira, 1999), and land use maps developed by Molin (2014; et al. 2015) from LANDSAT \n\n5 TM imagery for 2010, processed for a 1:60,000 scale. Although 5 years have elapsed, as it \n\nis one of the best available land use maps of this region, we used this map to represent the \n\ncurrent scenario.  Next, we adapted the land use map developed by Guimar\u00e3es (2013), which \n\nrepresents a 2010 land use scenario for the Cantareira System with the restoration of the most \n\nfragile degraded parcels (greatest potential for sediment production). \n\n \n\nTable 5.1.

Additionally, we assumed that the Second Scenario of Guimar\u00e3es \n\n(2013), who used the INVEST model to provide the ecological restoration benefits in the \n\nCantareira System, could be achieved in 2035, considering the investments provided under \n\nthe PCJ River Plan (Cobrape, 2011) for the recovery of riparian forests in the Cantareira \n\nSystem (in the PCJ Basin Plan this is called Tendency Scenario). As in the region the \n\nrestoration of riparian forests is mostly due to Water-PES projects, which was recognized as \n\nan Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) alternative (CBD, 2010; BFN/GIZ, 2013; Taffarello et \n\nal., submitted, Chapter 2), we identify the third scenario as S2+EbA. Thus, Figure 5.3 shows \n\nthe land-use changes over time. \n\nIn \u00a0 the \u00a0 \u201cTrend \u00a0 Scenario\u201d(PCJ-COBRAPE, 2011), the municipalities covered by the \n\nCantareira System could reach a 98% collection rate, collected sewage treatment rate of 100% \n\nand BOD5,20 removal efficiency of 95% (Cobrape, 2011). We emphasize that in Brazil the \n\ncurrent allowed discharge is only based of the BOD5,20 parameter. Some studies have \n\nsuggested the inclusion of other parameters such as dissolved oxygen, nitrate and phosphate \n\npolluting loads, and sediments to assess the water quality (Cruz, 2015; Cunha et al., 2014). \n\nRegarding the treatment costs for drinking supply, ecosystem-based adaptation options, such \n\nas watershed restoration, seems to be more cost-effective than several technologies for water \n\ntreatment (Cunha; Sabogal-Paz &amp; Dodds, 2016).. \n\n \n\n5.2.4. Defining contributing areas of sub-basins \n\nThe discretization sub-basins were taken up to fit, if feasible, the same NCE sites of \n\navailable field observations (see Chapter 4 of this thesis). In-site samples were feed into \n\nSWAT distributed model, also with points of qualitative and quantitative monitoring of 17 \n\ncontrol points. This procedure, combined with the addition of three reservoirs and river mouth \n\naround the Cantareira System, resulted in the automatic design of 20 sub-basins, with a \n\nthreshold of 7.1 km2 to define sub-basins (Figure 5.8). This threshold is close to the minimum \n\ndrainage area sampled (Taffarello et al, 2016; see Chapter 4 of this thesis). Drainage areas \n\nranged approximately 10 to 1000 km2. For optimized calibration, we defined 49 HRU inside \n\nthe 20 sub-basins. In other words, SWAT model defined 49 different combinations of soil \n\ntype, soil cover and slope classes in our study area. \n\nWe highlight some SWAT model limitations when we compare the simulated to \n\nobserved water flows, especially in the dry season. For example, when the model was \n\n\n\n109 \n \n\n \n\ndiscretized on a daily resolution, the adherence level between observed and simulated flows \n\nwas considered good. However, the model has not fitted well to observed values during the \n\ndrought period (Fev./2014-May/2014). These differences were more significant for water \n\nquality parameters, such as nitrate and total phosphorous. We point that the macronutrient \n\nloads found in May 2014 were clearly higher than the loads we have found in previous \n\nsampling, which occurred in wetter period (Taffarello et al. 2016). For the sample collected in \n\nMay, the model significantly underestimated the pollutant loads of nitrate. This behavior, \n\narising from the recent and most severe drought faced by the Cantareira System (Nobre et al., \n\n2016; Escobar, 2015; The Economist, 2015; Porto &amp; Porto, 2014, Palmer et al., 2014), shows \n\nthe urgent need for the improvement of the SWAT model performance during extreme events, \n\nespecially to capture non-linearities with impacts in regulating ecosystem services.  \n\n5.2.5. Calibration &amp; validation  \n\nWe used the SWAT CUP 5.1.6.2 interfaces and Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-\n\n2 algorithm) for calibrating the quantity and quality parameters and also for validating the \n\nsimulations in the sub-basins. Quantitative calibration was performed in stations that had \n\nmore than two full years of observed data, i.e., 8 stations, namely: Posses outlet, F23, F24, \n\nF25B, F28, Atibainha reservoir, Cachoeira reservoir, Jaguari and Jacarei reservoir (Table \n\n5.2). The calibration period was from October 2007 to September 2009, the period with \nobserved data in all of the above 8 stations. Validation took place from January 2006 to \n\nSeptember 2007 and from October 2009 to June 2014. Calibration and validation of SWAT at \n\nthe stations with over 2 years of data were rated as \u201cgood\u201d, \u00a0 according to the classification by \n\nMoriasi et al. (2007), since the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) criterion (Nash &amp; Sutcliffe, \n\n1970) was greater than 0.65, except for the Posses outlet, which presented the logarithmic \n\nNash-Sutcliffe of flows (a criterion that gives greater weight to smaller flow rates) of less than \n\n0.5 which was rated as \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d. \u00a0  \n\n\n\n110 \n \n\n \n  \n\n \nFigure 5.3. Land use change during 1990 (Scenario S1), 2010 (Scenario S2) and 2035 (Scenario S2+EbA) in the headwaters of the Cantareira \nWater Supply System.       \n\n\n\n111 \n \n\n \n\nThe Percent Bias (PBIAS) statistics indicates the bias percentage of simulated flows \n\nrelative to the observed flows (Gupta et al., 1999). Thus, when the PBIAS value is closer to \n\nzero, it results in a better representation of the basin, and in lower estimate tendencies \n\n(Moriasi et al., 2007). As a general rule, if |PBIAS| &lt;10%, it means a very good fit; 10% &lt;| \n\nPBIAS |&lt;15%, good; 15% &lt;| PBIAS | &lt;25%, satisfactory and | PBIAS | > 25%, the model is \n\ninappropriate. On the other hand, the NASH coefficient translates the application efficiency of \n\nthe model into more accurate predictions of flood flows, and using the classification: NASH> \n\n0.65 the model is rated as very good; 0.54 &lt;NASH &lt;0.65 the model is rated as good and \n\nbetween 0.5 and 0.54, it is rated as satisfactory.  \n\n \n\nTable 5.2.

Model calibration related to drainage areas of catchments in the Cantareira \n\nSystem.\n\n\n\n112 \n \n\n \n  \n\nIn the results obtained for different basin scales (Figure 5.4), the PBIAS and NASH \ncoefficients (including NASH for logarithms) indicate adequate quantitative adjustments. As \n\nthe SWAT simulations include more than 200 parameters, based on literature surveys (Duku \n\net al., 2015; Bressiani et al., 2015; Arnold et al., 2012; Garbossa et al., 2011), we selected \n\napproximately 10 parameters (see Table 5.3) to complete the calibration to simulate \n\nstreamflow processes and nutrients dynamics. These parameters refer to key processes which \n\nrepresent soil water storage, infiltration, evapotranspiration, flow channel, boundary \n\nconditions (see Mohor et al., 2015b) and main water quality processes at hillslopes. Although \n\nour calibration is mainly focused on water yield as total runoff, freshwater quality features \n\nthrough pollutant loads were performed in the scenarios.  \n\nMoreover, to reduce the uncertainty of our predictions, we used approximately 2500 \n\nprimary data derived from the experimental stage of this research to measure the parameters, \n\nreducing the uncertainties in the estimates of variables in the ecohydrological modeling stage \n\nof our research. Our decision to complement field and laboratory methods with computational \n\ntools in order to understand the behavior of basins is justified by Tucci (1998), who explains \n\nthe need for flow and other hydrological variables measurements, in addition to using the \n\nmodels, because\u201cnone methodology can increase the existing information in the data, but can \n\nbetter extract the existing information.\u201d As a parametrization result of field investigations and \n\necohydrological modeling, Figure 5.5 shows parts of calibrated model performance (lines) \nagainst field observations (dots with experimental uncertainty) for flow discharges, nitrate and \n\ntotal phosphorus loads for catchment areas ranging from 7.1 to 508 km2. Finally, other water \n\nquality variables were studied from data from field sampling. \n\nDifferences in flow rates and water quality (for the variables nitrate, \n\nphosphate, BOD5,20, turbidity and fecal coliforms) for the 20 sub-basins were evaluated using \n\nflow and load duration curves for the three scenarios proposed in this study: (i) recently past \n\nscenario (S1), including the recorded past events for land use in 1990, (ii) current land use \n\nscenario (S2), which considered land uses for the 2010-2015 period as the baseline, and (iii) \n\nfuture land use scenario (S2+EbA), supposing a forest cover conversion in the protected \n\nareas, through EbA options, according to the PCJ River Basin Plan by 2035. Using these \n\ncurves, from the methodology exposed by Hoekstra et al. (2011), and based on Duku et al. \n\n(2015) and Cunha et al. (2012), we estimated the grey water footprint (GWF). Next, we \n\ndeveloped an ecohydrological index to assess the regulating hydrologic services. \n\n \n\n\n\n113 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.5. Comparison between (a) flows discharge (m3/s) and (b) nitrate loads (kg/d) \nmeasured at field and simulated by SWAT, at monitored stations of (1) Posses Outlet (A=12 \nkm2), (2) F23 (Camanducaia, A = 508 km2), and (3) F24 (Cachoeira, A= 293.5 km2). The \nuncertainty bars were determined using the instantaneous velocities measured in the river \ncross-sections in the 2013-14 field campaigns. \n\n \n\n5.2.6. A new index for hydrologic services assessment \n\nAlso, we propose a new index for hydrologic services assessment related to the grey \n\nwater footprint. On the one hand, this new indicator encompasses the former theory related to \n\nenvironmental sustainability of the greyWF, according to Hoekstra et al. (2011). In this work, \n\nas a relevant local impact indicator, Hoekstra et al. (2011) propose \u00a0 calculating \u00a0 the \u00a0 \u2018water \u00a0\n\npollution \u00a0 level\u2019 \u00a0 (WPL) \u00a0 within \u00a0 the \u00a0 catchment, \u00a0 which \u00a0 measures \u00a0 the \u00a0 degree \u00a0 of \u00a0 pollution. \u00a0 WPL \u00a0 is \u00a0\n\ndefined as a fraction of the waste assimilation capacity consumed and calculated by taking the \n\nratio of the total of greyWF in a catchment (6WFgrey) to the actual runoff from that catchment \n\n(Ract), or, in a proxy manner, the water yield or mean water yield or long-term period (Qlp). \n\nThis assumption is that a water pollution level of 100 per cent means that the waste \n\nassimilation capacity has been fully consumed. Also, this assumption approaches that when \n\nWPL exceeds 100 per cent, ambient water quality standards are violated, as: \n\n \n\n??\n\nWPL x,t> @ \n\u00a6WFgrey x,t> @\nRact x,t> @  \n\n\n\n114 \n \n\n \n  \n\nIt is worth mentioning that, for some experts, the forementioned equation can \n\noverestimate the flow necessary to dilute pollutants. For that reason, it is recommended new \n\ninsights of composite indicators or thresholds, as follows. \n\nOn the other hand, the above assumption could overestimate WPL because it would \n\nfail considering the combined capacity of water to assimilate multiple pollutants (Hoekstra et \n\nal., 2012; Smakhtin et al., 2005). Conversely, in this work, we define an alternative indicator \n\nrelated to the three following fundamentals. First, the WPL should be extended to a composite \n\nindex, thereby representing weights of each pollutant related to the actual runoff, here as a \n\nproxy of long-term runoff, i.e.: \n\n \n\n??\n\nWPLcomposite x,t> @ \n\u00a6 w x,t> @? WFgrey x,t> @^ `\nRact x,t> @#Qlp x,t> @\n\nw x,t> @\u00a6  1  \n0 d w x,t> @d1  \n \n\nFor this new equation, weights should be assessed, either from field experiments or even from \n\nsimulation outputs. Second, I define a threshold value of WPLcomposite regarding the \n\nreference catchments with non-developed conditions which suggest more conservation \n\nconditions among other catchments of the same region, as WPLreference. For this work, we \n\nselected Domithildes catchment, as the reference catchment with conservancy measures. From \n\nthis reference catchment we define the referenced, composite water pollution level, as \n\nWPLcom posite,ref and with a derived the Hydrologic Service Index, as a non dimensional factor \n\nof comparing WPL for referenced and non-referenced catchment, as follows: \n\n \n\n??\n\nHSI x,t> @greyWF  \n[WPL[x,t] ?WPLcomposite,ref ]\n\nWPLcomposite,ref  \n \n\n5.3. Results and Discussion \n\nIn the following section we present results from field observations, useful not only for \n\necohydrologic parameterization, but also to elucidate features regarding GWF and hydrologic \n\nservices. Next, we compare GWF outputs from simulations of LULC scenarios, including \n\nEbA options, to finally propose a new hydrological services indicator. \n\n\n\n115 \n \n\n \n\n \nTable 5.3.

Data from field sampling \n\nThe variations in LULC affect freshwater quality which, in turn, affect the dynamics \n\nof aquatic ecosystems (Zaffani et al., 2015; Botelho et al., 2013; Hamel et al., 2013; Bach &amp; \n\nOstrowski, 2013; Kaiser et al., 2013). These changes impact the hydrological services, \n\nespecially the regulating and supporting ecosystem services (Mulder et al., 2015; Molin, \n\n2014). Some of the water quality and quantity variables from our freshwater monitoring are \n\nrelevant in the hydrological services assessment, thus they are presented in Table 5.4. These \n\nvariables were selected due to its relation to the anthropic impacts into the water bodies and as \n\na function of its sanitary relevance. \n\n\n\n116 \n \n\n \n  \n\n \n\nTable 5.4.

The Figure 5.6 shows the direct correlation between turbidity and size of the sub-\n\nbasins. Turbidity can indirectly indicate anthropic impacts in streams and rivers (Martinelli et \n\nal., 1999). The lower turbidity mean values were observed in two more conserved sub-basins \n\n(which presented higher amounts of forest remnants): 2,7 NTU in the reference Canc\u00e3 farm \n\nand 4,7 NTU in Upper Posses. Other conserved subbasins also presented low mean values of \n\nturbidity (&lt;6,5 NTU): intervention Canc\u00e3 farm (6,2 NTU), and Cachoeira dos Pretos (6,4 \n\nNTU). We found the highest turbidity, above 40 NTU considered the maximum established \n\nwater quality conditions for Class 1 according to environmental standards (BRASIL, 2005), in \n\nthe Parque de Eventos (76,8 NTU), F23 (69,5 NTU) and Salto outlet (50,8 NTU). However, \n\nthese three sampling sites are located at water bodies of Class 2, which the maximum \n\nturbidity allowed is up to 100 NTU (BRAZIL, 2005). Thus, it shows that, although these \n\nareas have the highest urbanization among sampled sites, they are in accordance to Brazilian \n\nenvironmental resolutions. Arroio J\u00fanior (2013) found a decreasing relation between turbidity \n\nand drainage area in another catchment located in Sao Paulo state. \n\nTemporal patterns of turbidity point that in 11 from 17 monitored sites, on the one \n\nhand, the higher values of turbidity occurred in December 2013, the unique field campaign \n\nwith significant precipitation (35,3 mm) and with higher antecedent precipitation index (API \n\n= 123,7mm). This can be due to the carrying of allochthone particles which are drained into \n\nrivers by precipitation. Similarly, Arroio J\u00fanior (2013), also observing higher turbidity in \n\nrainy month (December 2012) which can lead to erosive processes. On the other hand, Zaffani \n\net al. (2015) show that turbidity did not varied over the hydrological year in medium-size, \n\nrural and peri-urban watersheds ranging from 1 to 242 km2. In this case, other factors can \n\nhave influenced, such as deforestation, seasonal variability, soil use type, sewage and mining \n\n(CETESB, 2015; Tundisi, 2014). Our study shows two catchments with maximum turbidity \n\nhigher than Brazilian environmental standards (Brazil, 2005): 67 NTU for Upper Jaguari and \n\n59 NTU for Cancan outlet, one site under this limit (Cancan outlet) and three sites with \n\nmaximum turbidity above 100 NTU: Parque de Eventos, in Jaguari river, with 283 NTU; F23 \n\ngauge in Camanducaia river, with 180 NTU, and Salto outlet, with 160 NTU. These sites do \n\nnot obey the Class II Standards. On the other hand, the Figure 5.7 presents a \n\nmultidimensional chart which integrates hydraulic and water quality variables.  \n\n \n\n\n\n118 \n \n\n \n  \n\n \nFigure 5.6. Experimental sampling of turbidity, observed flowsand mean velocities in river \ncross sections of 17 catchments in Cantareira System headwater (Oct. 2013 - May2014) \n \n\n \nFigure 5.7. Multidimensional chart of hydraulic and water quality variables sampled in field \ncampaigns in the headwaters of Cantareira Water Supply System between Oct. 2013 - May \n2014. \n\n \n\n\n\n119 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.7 illustrates empirical relations from field sampling throughout experimental \n\nsurveys in Oct.2013-May2014, thereby enhancing non-linear relations and complexity of not-\n\nsampled factors. The choice of maximum values for electrical conductivity and nitrate \n\nconcentrations is because it can represent the limit conditions for the rivers autodepuration \n\nand aquatic ecosystems health. The right quadrants of Figure 5.7 show a positive relationship \nbetween nitrate concentrations and flow both discharges and mean water level. It is possible \n\nto infer that higher concentrations of macronutrients would be found in downstream areas. \n\nThis trend can be associated to the nutrients migration (Cunha et al., 2013), land-use change \n\n(Zaffani et al., 2015), besides punctual pollution. In addition, the absent of riparian forest in \n\n70% of protected area (36.844 ha) of the Cantareira System (Guimar\u00e3es, 2013) can increase \n\nthe sedimentation and make the pollutants filtration more difficult, leading to higher nitrate \n\nconcentrations downstream. Furthermore, we could not evidence clear relationships between \n\nelectrical conductivity and measurements of water level and flow discharges (Figure 5.7, left \nside). Besides, the untypical values of 135 \u00b5S/cm and 0.074 m3/s show higher sensitivity of \n\nphysico-chemical and hydraulics variables to the external factors, hydrodynamics or seasonal \n\nlocal influences. Santos (2014), in a water quality evaluation in watersheds with implemented \n\nconservation practices (Posses and Salto), found electrical conductivity lower than 50 \u00b5S.cm-1 \n\nin forest remnants areas, and more than 100 \u00b5S.cm-1 in the stretch of Jaguari river between \n\nour SWAT subbasin 1 (Upper Jaguari) and subbasin 5 (Parque de Eventos), where  \n\nanthropization covers 3 % of area. In general, areas with higher anthropization rates present \n\nhigher ionic concentrations (Martinelli et al., 1999; Piccirelli Santos, 2014), which can be \n\nshown by the electrical conductivity. However, outliers values difficult a better \n\ncomprehension of geomorfological health of rivers and of the functioning of complex riverine \n\necosystems with very high biodiversity, as occurs in this subtropical region.  \n\n5.3.2. Setting time-steps of hydrologic modeling under scenarios \n\nThe changes in hydrologic services can be evaluated by a wide number of models \n\n(Carvalho-Santos et al, 2016; Duku et al, 2015; Quilb\u00e9 &amp; Rousseau, 2007), especially those \n\nmore user-friendly for stakeholders and policy makers. Simulations in this watershed-scale \n\necohydrological model (Williams et al, 2008; and Borah &amp; Bera, 2003) allow the \n\nquantification of important variables for ecosystem services analysis and decision-making. \n\nThe evaluation of the results from simulations approaches the balance of the components of \n\nthe hydrological cycle at defined geographic and temporal scales. Hydrological models with \n\nfreshwater quality routines (eg., QUAL-2K, QUAL-2E, SWMM, SWAT) represent the water \n\n\n\n120 \n \n\n \n  \n\nbalance and the coupling processes of water quality. Considering the integrated \n\necohydrological processes of an entire river basin, thereby linking LULC changes, greyWF \n\noutputs and EbA tradeoffs, we here propose a spatially-distributed model which incorporates \n\nthe regional variabilities of field observations in 17 NCE sites (see Chapter 4), with time steps \n\nin accordance with expected intra-annual river regimes, pointing high flows and low flows. In \n\nour case, using SWAT for assessing the regulating ecosystem services permit a versatility \n\nwith ecohydrological aspects of water yield and intra-annual regime, integrating water \n\nquantity and quality to assess expected greyWF under semi-distributed modeling with some \n\ncomputational constraints (Tucci, 2015; Santos, 2009). Depending on the availability of input \n\ndata, as a user we can determine the simulations carried by the more appropriate time-steps \n\n(Boithias et al., 2015). Considering the frequency of qualitative and quantitative data \n\navailable, and according the field experiments (see Chapter 4), monthly time step was defined \n\nappropriate to hypothesis testing of GWF and water yield under different LULC scenarios, \n\nincluding EbA. A common test period for all LULC scenarios was selected with several years. \n\nIn our case, the test period ranges from 01 Jan., 2006 to 30 June 2014. This period has the \n\nrain-anomaly of drought conditions of 2013-14. In summary, different LULC scenarios were \n\ntested with the same input data series.  \n\n5.3.3. LULC change scenarios \n\nWe then evaluated the three land-use scenarios. A past-condition scenario (S1, in \n\n1990), a present-condition (S2, in 2010) and a future (S2+Eba, in 2035) LULC scenario, \n\napplying the same weather input datafiles, are shown in Table 5.5. This allow us to compare \n\nthe mainly soil uses in 1990, 2010 e 2035 into 20 sub-basins of Cantareira System. \n\n  \n\n\n\n121 \n \n\n \n\n \n \nFigure 5.8.

Jaguari has significant percentage of surface waters, \n\noccupying 1% of sub-basin 10 and 20% of sub-basin 15. We evaluated the effects of LULC \n\nchange scenarios in 20 catchments within Jaguari, Cachoeira and Moinho sub-basins, South-\n\nEast Brazil. Concerning the land-use change, the main soil uses 25 years ago were: pasture (in \n\n50% of the sub-basins) and native vegetation (in 45% of sub-basins). According to ISA \n\n(2012) and Molin (2014), the 5% of remaining area were divided into vegetables, eucalyptus, \n\nsparse human settlements, bare soil and mining. The main activity in the past (1990) was the \n\nextensive cattle for milk production by small farmers in the region (ANA, 2012; Veiga Neto, \n\n2008).  \n\nIn the S2 Scenario (2010), the main soil use is pasture in 58% of the sub-basins and \n\nforest in 40% of them. Between 1990 and 2010 there was a significant conversion of soil \n\ncover, with a slow reduction of pasture areas (-2%) and of native remnants (-5%) and with a \n\nprogressive increase of eucalypto (Eucalyptus sp.), an exotic forest in Brazil. The eucalypto \n\nsoil use varied from +1%, within Posses up to +31% in the Chal\u00e9 Ponto Verde sub-basin in \n\n2010. Eucalyptus cover, however, did not achieve 10% of the soil uses in any of the simulated \n\nsub-basins in 1990. In the third scenario (S2 + EbA), we hypothesized incentives to policies \n\nfor forest conservation and restoration, due to the strengthening of EbA in the Cantareira \n\nSystem, and could lead to native vegetation achieve percentages between 15% in Posses \n\noutlet and 69% in F28 sub-basin. In this scenario the higher percentages of native vegetation \n\nwill occur in the sub-basins F28, Upper Jaguari and Cachoeira dos Pretos.  \n\nBy assessing the temporal trends of increment or reduction of native remnants, we \n\nexamined the periods 1990-2010 versus 2010-2035. Between 1990 and 2010, forest increased \n\npositively in 50% in sub-basins of Domithildes, which a reference headwater catchment of the \n\nWater Producer/PCJ project, (see Taffarello et al., 2016, Chapter 4 of this thesis), Moinho, \n\nCachoeira dos Pretos,  F34, B. Jacare\u00ed, B. Atibainha, B. Cachoeira, Pq Eventos, F25B and B. \n\nJaguari (Figure 5.9). Related to the 2010-2035 period, the model was set up with increasing \n\nof native vegetation in all sub-basins, either from native remnant in 2010 and even from new \n\nBMP practices of reforestation with native species in 20 sub-basins until year 2035 (Figure \n5.9). The hidro-services in Posses and Salto catchments and in the Cachoeira sub-basin will \n\nbe increased in 2035 as a function of the efforts on EbA which currently exist in the region \n\n(Richards et al., 2015; Piccirelli Santos, 2014; Gon\u00e7alves, 2013).  \n\n\n\n124 \n \n\n \n  \n\n \nFigure 5.9. Native forests cover in S1 (year 1990), S2 (year 2010) and S2+EbA (year 2035). \n \n\nDespite this general increasing of native forest cover, we highlight the deforestation \n\noccurred in the F23 sub-basin, Camanducaia river. Currently, although it has 34% of native \n\nforest cover, this rate trend to have reducing since 1990. F23 outlet (sub-basin 2) presented \n\n37% of native forest cover in 1990, becoming 34 % in 2010 and, the S2+EbA Scenario shows \n\nthat F23 would achieve 36.2% \u00a0 of \u00a0 native \u00a0 forest \u00a0 in \u00a0 2035, \u00a0 backing \u00a0 to \u00a0 the \u00a0 1990\u2019s \u00a0 rates. \u00a0 Another \u00a0\n\ncritical situation is the Posses outlet (SWAT sub-basin 6): despite the conservation efforts \n\nwhich have been performed in the region through Water Conservator project (see Richards et \n\nal., 2015; Piccirelli Santos, 2014; Pereira, 2013), the current percentage of native remnants is \n\n13%, which can become 16% in 2035, however \u00a0not \u00a0achieving \u00a0the \u00a01990\u2019s \u00a0rate \u00a0(22%). \u00a0This \u00a0can \u00a0\n\npotentially disrupt the regulating and provision hydrologic services provided by Posses sub-\n\nbasin and needs to be deeply evaluated. \n\nNext, we analyze spatio-temporal patterns of the main soil uses which competing with \n\nforest cover: pasture and eucalypto. First, related to pasture, we observe that it was the main \n\nuse in the past in 60% of the sub-basins (in 1990) and, currently, it became the majority \n\nLULC by ca. 40%. Our scenarios indicate that, as a function of the EbA strengthening, \n\nencouraging the links between environmental conservation and forest restoration, 20% of the \n\nsub-basins can be mainly occupied by pasture (sub-basins 2, 4, 6 and 7). This rate is \n\nreasonable, considering rural sub-basins. Moreover, the reducing of pasture in the Cantareira \n\nSystem was more evident in the 1990-2010 period than in the 2010-2035scenario. This can be \n\nexplained by, at least, three factors: i) rural landowners awareness of the relevance of \n\n\n\n125 \n \n\n \n\nconversion from pasture to native forest for the generation and maintenance of ecosystem \n\nservices in the Cantareira System (Saad, 2016; Extrema, 2015; Mota da Silva, 2014; Padovezi \n\net al., 2013; Gon\u00e7alvez, 2013; Veiga-Neto, 2008); ii) seasonal changes in the ecosystem \n\nstructure which can increase the ecosystem resilience (Mulder et al., 2015) and observed \n\nsignificant increasing, mainly in the 1990-2010 period, of non-native species plantation.   \n\nSecond, related to eucalypto cover, the future scenario shows an increasing threat to \n\nthe regulating and supporting services as a result of the exotic forest in expansion.  In 2035, \n\neucalypto cover can encompass, in average, 12% of the total area of the 20 catchments here \n\nstudied. This is significant in comparison with 10% in 2010 and only 2% in 1990 for the same \n\ncatchments. This scenario until 2035 takes attention for the maintenance of hydrologic \n\nservices, because eucalypto monocrop can potentially impact not only on headwaters but on \n\nentire landscapes, threatening ecosystem dynamics. Moreover, these plantations, with an \n\naverage wood yield of 50 to 60 m3of Urograndis per hectare, need for higher amounts of \n\nagrochemicals, due to lower population diversity and lower adaptation to climate change \n\n(Kageyama &amp; dos Santos, 2015). In short, here we highlight the threat on biodiversity that \n\nhave been brought by alien species in headwaters and the changes that it can promote on \n\nnative species (Hulme &amp; Le Roux, 2016) which, in turn,  impact the ecosystem services. \n\nConsidering the river basin as the management unit, the soil uses impact not only on \n\nquantity, but also on quality. Thus, we analyse water and nutrient yields, intra-annual regime \n\nand duration curves, both in quantity-quality of pollutants, in the following topics. \n\n5.3.2.3. Water yield as a function of soil cover \n\nAlthough the water-forest system interaction is a classic issue in Hydrology (Hibbert, \n\n1967; Tucci &amp; Clarke, 1998; Adre\u00e1ssian, 2004; Zhao et al., 2012), the comprehension of the \n\nimpacts of vegetation on quali-quantitatives aspects of water resources needs refinements.  \n\nAt hydrological methodologies, the use of expressive variable numbers in describing \n\nthe hydrological regime for riparian ecosystems conservation is valuable (Collischonn et al., \n\n2005). In this context, the assessment of simulations occurs through analysis of balance of \n\nhydrological cycle components at determined spatial and temporal scales. The results analysis \n\nwas performed, on the one hand, from regional comparison related to the size of drainage \n\nareas and, on the other hand, by the hydrological function which features water and nutrients \n\navailability. \n\nThe selection of hydrologic function which characterizes the water availability can be \n\nconcerned to representativeness of environmental and physical processes which occur at \n\n\n\n126 \n \n\n \n  \n\ncatchment scale in a dynamic way (Cruz &amp; Tucci, 2008). In this work, we selected using \n\nquali-quantitative duration curves for integrated assessment of availability and quality of \n\nwater. The flow-and-load duration curve is a simple and important analysis (Collischonn &amp; \n\nDornelles, 2013). In quantitative terms, the flow duration curve shows the probabilistic \n\ntemporal distribution of water availability (Cruz &amp; Silveira, 2007), relating the flow discharge \n\npassing at one river cross section related to a percentage of time in which it is overpassed or \n\nequaled (Cruz &amp; Tucci, 2008).     \n\nThe three scenarios S1, S2 and S2+EbA resulted in different flow values for the 20 \n\nsub-basins (Figure 5.10). Based on arithmetic mean of time series of monthly water yield, \n\nrelated to catchment areas, and assessed to all modelled sub-basins (N=20), results point \n\naverage values water yield of: 31.4 \u00b1 25.2 L.s-1.km-2 for S1 (1990), 14.9 \u00b1 11.5L.s-1.km-2 for \n\nS2(2010) and 21.4 \u00b1 15.3 L.s-1.km-2 for S2+EbA (2035), respectively. This very high variation \n\ncan be due to the complexity of river basin systems and the several sources of uncertainty in \n\nthe representation of ecohydrological processes.  \n\nThe three scenarios analized and the ecohydrologic monitoring (Chapter 4) provide \n\ndifferent types of information for the same catchments. But how can we integrate the relative \n\nimportance of information from each source (Kapustka &amp; Landis, 2010)? A detailed study \n\nshowing the relationship between sensitivity (and uncertainty) of analysis and the \n\neffectiveness of Water-PES should be done.  \n\nFor a while, the decrease of -52.4% in water yield between S1 (1990) and S2 (2010) \n\nscenarios (= (14.9-31.3)/31.3.100) could be due to marginal increases of eucalypto cover. In \n\nfact, between 1990 and 2010, eucalypto cover increased +6.8 % in total land cover, but \n\n+181% in relative terms. Other possible explanation is the decrease of native vegetation \n\nbetween 1990 and 2010, with -1.8 % in total land cover, but -4.3%, in relative terms.  \n\nIn parallel, we evaluate the water yield. Thus, the flow-and-load duration curves \n\nsummarize the flow and pollutant load variability, thereby showing potential links and \n\nimpacts for aquatic ecosystem sustainability (Cunha et al., 2012; Cruz &amp; Tucci, 2008).  From \n\nthese curves, we obtained two different behaviours for the studied sub-basins (Figure 5.10): \nBehaviour I: the water yield in 2010 reduced in relation to 1990 and the water yield in \n\n2035 might overpass the 1990 levels. The examples are:Upper Jaguari, Cachoeira sub-basin \n\n(including Cachoeira dos Pretos, Chal\u00e9 Ponto Verde, Ponte Cachoeira, F24 outlet) and \n\nMoinho catchment; \n\n\n\n127 \n \n\n \n\nBehaviour II: the water yield after 2010 was reduced until 2035 and this water yield \n\nrecuperation was not possible for the values in 1990. Examples, in decreasing size of drainage \n\nareas, are: Atibainha, B. Jaguari, F25B, Parque de Eventos, F23, B.Atibainha, F34, F30, \n\nSalto, Posses Outlet, Domithildes, Portal das Estrelas (Middle Posses). \n\n \nFigure 5.10. Flow duration curves simulated under three LULC scenarios: S1(1990), \nS2(2010) and S2+EbA (2035) in 20 catchments at headwaters of Cantareira Water Supply \nSystem. \n\n\n\n128 \n \n\n \n  \nOn the one hand, according to Figure 5.11, the water yield of S1 is inversely \n\nproportional to land use of mixed forest cover. The water yield in S2 indicates a constant \n\nvalue of approximately 17 L s-1km-2. Also for the S2+EbA scenario, with incorporates the \n\nEbA approach through BMP, the water yield is approximately 17 L s-1km-2, but with slight \n\nincrease in the water yield for mixed forest cover higher than 50%. Presumably, this slight \n\nincrease in the water yield would be related to the type of the best management practices \n\n(BMP) of the recovery forests, which still not achieved evapotranspiration rates of the climax \n\nstage. In riparian forest under recuperation there are lesser evapotranspiration rates and, thus, \n\nmore quantity of precipitation reach soil and rivers through canopy. This process could \n\nbenefit other hydrological components, like runoff, increasing water flows into the rivers. \n\nThis effect can possibly explain the behaviour I catchments (see Fig. 5.10). \n\nOn the other hand, we observed in Posses, Salto, Jaguari, Canc\u00e3 and Atibainha \n\ncatchments an inverse situation (behaviour II). This effect can be related to the hydrologic \nresponse produced by: (a) type of catchment; (b) size of catchment; (c) the low soil moisture \n\nin the red-yellow latosol (Embrapa, 2016), which did not favor high evapotranspiration rates; \n\n(d) the riparian forest, originates from the EbA or Water-PES actions, will be at initial stages, \n\nnot achieving in 20 years (this explanation thereby assumes the baseline of PES actions held \n\nin 2015, spite of existing examples of restored forests in Extrema-MG the higher \n\nevapotranspiration rates we usually find in forests at climax); and (e) unpredictability, non-\n\nlinearity and uncertainty (Ferraz et al., 2013; Lima &amp; Zakia, 2006). \n\nThe forest role in the hydrological cycle at river basin scales has been debated for \n\ncenturies. Riparian native forest, eucalypto and riparian forest in recuperation (orchard) have \n\ndifferent hydrological responses. The knowledge about influence of different types and phases \n\nof vegetation in the hydrological processes still has gaps to be fulfilled. Bayer (2014) found \n\nthat the vegetation height and the leaf area index are inversely proportional to the water flows, \n\nwhich corroborate previous studies (Hibbert, 1967). Riparian forest restoration increases the \n\nmean evapotranspiration, reducing the water yield (Molin, 2014; Salemi et al., 2012; Lima &amp; \n\nZakia, 2006; Andreassian, 2004). Restoration increases the water storage capability into the \n\ncatchment throughout the riparian zone, contributing to the higher water flow in the dry \n\nseason (Lima &amp; Zakia, 2000). This can lead to unexpected results regarding water yield. \n\nFurthermore, at small catchments of temperate climate, researchers estimated that \n\ndeforestation in 40% of the catchment would increase the runoff of 130 \u00b1 89 mm.year-1 \n\nconsidering the entire water cycle at catchment scale (Collischonn &amp; Dornelles, 2013). Still \n\n\n\n129 \n \n\n \n\nthere are large dispersion in results from monitoring (usually, in paired catchments or Nested \n\nCatchment Experiment - NCE), which makes the forecast of flow discharge as a result of soil \n\nuse conversion more difficult. Similarly, we found high dispersion in the comparison between \n\nwater yields versus different land cover in 20 sub-basins of subtropical climate (Figure 5.11).   \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.11. LULC scenarios for specific water yield for 20 drainage areas at Jaguari, \nCachoeira and Atibainha watersheds, according to S1 (1990), S2 (2010) and S2+EbA (2035) \nscenarios.  \n\n \n\nBMP are in progress since 2005 in Posses Outlet (sub-basin 6, Table 5.5) and Middle \n\nPosses (Portal das Estrelas, N\u00ba 7), and since 2009 in Domithildes, F30 and Moinho \n\ncatchments (Subbasins 9, 11 and 20, respectively). These BMP are from Water Conservator \n\nand Water Producer/PCJ. In these cases, we point to have caution when support PES as the \n\n\n\n130 \n \n\n \n  \n\nmain driver linking reforested cover areas to more water availability (ANA, 2013). Parts of \n\nthese results and previous investigation, which has been made through NCE (Taffarello et al., \n\n2016, chapter 4 of this thesis), point the opposite, i.e., in the more conserved catchments we \n\nfound lower water yields. Despite there are many Water-PES programs in Brazil (Pagiola, von \n\nGlehn &amp; Taffarello, 2013; Guedes &amp; Seehusen, 2011), measurements of the effect on water \n\nyield under forest restoration are still lacking in tropical and subtropical conditions (Taffarello \n\net al., 2016a; Salemi et al., 2012). However, the benefits of riparian forest on water quality, \n\nmargin stability, reduction of water erosion and silting are also evident in scientific literature \n\n(Piccirelli Santos, 2014; dos Santos et al., 2014; Studinski et al., 2012; Udawatta et al., 2010).  \n\n5.3.2.4. Relationships between land-use/land-cover change and grey water footprint \n\nFor an integrated assessment of hydro-services, we analyze the spatio-temporal \n\nconditions of load production at the sub-basin scale. Considering we are studying rural sub-\n\nbasins, the water pollution is mainly produced by diffuse source regarded to fertilizers and \n\nagrochemicals. In this context, we evaluate the GWF evolution to show the behaviours of \n\nnitrate (N-NO3), total phosphorous (TP) and sediments (Sed) yields from simulating scenarios \n\nS1, S2 and S2+EbA. First, we calculate the nitrate loads generated from the 20 sub-basins in \n\nthe three scenarios. Second, we made the same for total phosphorous loads and sediment \n\nyields.  Third, encompassing the river regime, we calculated the greyWF for nitrate, total \n\nphosphorous and sediments in each sub-basin, to develop new sustainable and composite \n\nindices. \n\nConcerning nitrate, the sampled concentrations were low (see previous chapter). In \n\naddition, SWAT simulations also brought very low outputs, and the greyWF-NO3 vary from \n\n0.11 L/s per km2 (in Atibainha subbasin, under S2 (2010) scenario) to 2.83 L/s per km2 (in \n\nMiddle Posses catchment, Portal das Estrelas, under S2+EbA (2035) scenario). Considering \n\nBrazilian water quality standards for nitrate, the maximum allowed concentration is 10 mg/L \n\n(Brasil, 2005). These low amounts of nitrate loads make the greyWF-NO3 falling to low \n\nvalues in the three scenarios analyzed (Figure 5.12a). Complementary, we have also chosen \n\nto explore greyWF for total phosphorous and sediments. \n\nIn relation to total phosphorous (TP), the load duration curves from S1, S2 and \n\nS2+EbA scenarios present disparities. For example, the greyWF for TP decreased in all sub-\n\nbasins between 1990, 2010 and 2035. In this last period (2010-2035), the model predicts a \n\nnew behaviour for the greyWF-TP.  \n\n\n\n131 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.12. Fraction of water yield compromised by the grey water footprint for nitrate, total \nphosphorous and sediments versus drainage area (a), and showing the studied subbasins (b). \n \n\nResults of greyWF for TP, NO3 and sediments allow us to infer some regionalization \n\nfor nutrient loads. Among the 20 sub-basins studied, we selected 2 sub-basins as study cases \n\nto illustrate the links between LULC and greyWF: (1) the Upper Jaguari subbasin, and (2) \n\nDomithildes catchment.  \n\n5.3.2.4.1 Case study I: Upper Jaguari sub-basin \n\nThe Upper Jaguari has 302 km2 and is the second most upstream sub-basin within the \n\nCantareira System (downstream of only F28 sub-basin, with 277 km2). Comparing scenario \n\n1990 (S1) and 2010 (S2), results depicted evidence that native forest decayed aprox. 10 %. \n\nIndeed, scenario 2035 (S2+EbA) still assumes a very small decrease of native forest. This fall \n\n\n\n132 \n \n\n \n  \n\ncould be potentially traded off through increasing secondary forests by BMP, that would \n\nstabilise the native forest LULC in 70% until 2035.The mean annual simulated water yields, \n\nin spite of high variability of simulated scenarios, pointed values of 18 L.s-1.km2 (1990, S1), \n\n13 L.s-1.km2 (2010, S2) and 21 L.s-1.km2 (for 2035, S2+EbA). Variabilities are related to \n\nhydrologic conditions simulated in the test period of 2006 until 2014. In turn, this test period \n\nwas selected due to high availability of rainfall stations under operation, which would \n\npotentially better perform distributed modeling at several sub-basis using SWAT. In \n\nsummary, for the three scenarios simulated, the relationships between the native forest cover \n\nand mean water yield are different each other. For scenario S1 (1990), the higher native forest \n\ncover, the lower water yield. This scenario behavior is extended at experimental sites, and \n\neven extensively documented in the literature (Salemi et al, 2012; Smarthust et al., 2012, \n\nCollischon &amp; Dornelles, 2013). In turn, for scenario S2 (2010) the water yield seems not fully \n\nrelated to native forest LULC, oscillating around an average value of 18 L/s/km2. In scenario \n\nS2+EbA (2035), however, there is a little increase in water yield when native forest cover is \n\nhigher than 50%. This proportional relation between water yield and forest cover in the \n\nS2+EbA is both controversial and contrary with results published by some authors (e.g. \n\nCollischonn &amp; Dornelles, 2013; Salemi et al., 2012). For example, in previous chapter, \n\nmonitoring data shows reduction in the water yield with higher native forest land cover \n\n(Taffarello et al., 2016a). Salemi and coauthors, in a review on the effect of riparian forest on \n\nwater yield, found that riparian vegetation cover decreases water yield from daily to annual \n\nbasis. \n\nFurthermore, the greyWF-NO3 of Upper Jaguari basin pointed 0.14 L/s per km2 for \n\nscenario S1 (1990), increased to 0.23 L/s per km2 for scenario S2(2010) and would grow to \n\nca. 0.54 L/s per km2 in S2+EbA scenario (in 2035). Lower values of greyWF of nitrates, \n\nalthouth represent lower water volume needed to dillute nitrates flowing to streams per square \n\nkilometer of draining catchment. This results, however, is different of expected in the \n\nhypothesis testing through modeling. The null hypothesis says increasing native forest cover \n\nis correlated to decreasing nutrient loads flowing to streams. The former results, modelled by \n\nSWAT, predicted an increase in greyWF in 2035. Simulated increase of native forest (approx. \n\n+5%) would appear to be not enough for buffering nitrogen loads from both pesticides and \n\nanimals\u2019 \u00a0 excrements \u00a0 like \u00a0 mammals \u00a0 or \u00a0 zoopl\u00e2ncton. \u00a0 For \u00a0 deeper analysis, other factors \n\ninfluenced on greyWF should be evaluated at all. \n\n\n\n133 \n \n\n \n\nConcerning greyWF in Upper Jaguari sub-basin in S2+EbA (2035) scenario, SWAT \n\noutputs assessed ca. 0.1L/s per km2 related to total phosphorous (TP) and 0 L/s per km2 for \n\nsediments. In this subbasin, diffuse pollution from nitrates would be (or lower than) 5 times \n\nhigher than pollution from TP. Adaptive management are needed to avoid future problems of \n\neutrophication, caused by excessive nitrogen in waters. As nitrogen is highly mobile in \n\nfreshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, surface water nitrate isotopes could be used to monitor \n\nnitrogen variations in catchment-scale attenuation, as proposed by Wells et al. (2016). In this \n\ncontext, the calculus of greyWF for nitrate, using nitrate isotopes (?15N \u00a0 and \u00a0 ?18O of NO3-2), \n\ncould be an auxiliary tool in understanding spatial and temporal variations in nitrogen export \n\nthroughout the catchments. \n\n5.3.2.4.2 Case study II: Domithildes headwater \n\nDomithildes catchment (9.9 km2) is located in Canc\u00e3 catchment. Similar to Upper \n\nJaguari, Domithildes is one of the most conserved sub-basins, mainly with native forests. By \n\ncomparing S1 and S2 (see Figure 5.14), native forest fraction remained constant (51% in \nS1(1990) and 52% in S2 (2010). Unlike Upper Jaguari sub-basin (see Figure 5.13), native \n\nvegetation would increase by 56% in S2+EbA (2035). Because Domithildes is adopted as \n\nreference basin for Water Producer/PCJ, the augmented fraction of native forest by 2035 \n\nwould point an increase of secondary forest.  \n\nRegarding water yield, Domithildes catchment \u00a0 classified \u00a0 as \u00a0 second \u00a0 type \u00a0 of \u00a0 \u2018subbasins \n\nbehaviour\u2019. \u00a0 For \u00a0 example, its annual water yield in 2010 (~18 L/s per km2) was smaller than in \n\n1990 (~ 29 L/s per km2). Since 2010 onwards, however, water yield would replenish towards \n\nS2+EbA conditions in 2035, close to 23L/s per km2. This positive increment between 2010 \n\nand 2035, although, would not achieve values obtained for S1 conditions in 1990.  \n\nOther factors, beyond of native vegetation, would influence the hydrologic cycle at \n\nDomithildes catchment, decreasing water yields in the 2010 scenario (S2). One explanation of \n\nthis water yield decrease would be the positive LULC of Eucaliptus sp. of +5% in 2010 (S2). \n\nSalemi et al. (2012) presented a review results as increased annual water use, as \n\nevapotranspiration, for each 10% of area covered with eucalypto, pinus, acacia or native \n\nsubtropical species beside the stream ranged from 11 to 112 mm per year. Smethurst et al. \n\n(2015) estimated a water use by native riparian tropical Brazilian forest of 84 mm per year \n\n(7% of annual precipitation). Regardless other factors, according to previous statements, +1% \n\nof eucalipto land use fraction in Domithildes will represent -2 L/s/km2 of water yield, or -63 \n\n\n\n134 \n \n\n \n  \n\nmm per year, in the same range of results reported by Salemi (2012) and close to Semthurst et \n\nal (2015).  \n\nComparing seasonal water yields, results pointed higher variability around monthly \n\nflow averages for S2+EbA (2035) scenario. These deviations in monthly flows of 2035 \n\nscenario were higher in wetter months, between November and March. The regulation of \n\nwater yield, in both rainy and dry conditions, is more effective when quantifyied through \n\nvariance (Molin, 2014). In spite of these uncertainties, scenarios modeled through SWAT \n\nestimated the highest mean monthly water yield in February (38 L/s per km2) and the lowest \n\nmean monthly water yield in September and October (8 L/s per km2). On the one hand, results \n\npointed that growing rate of native vegetation LULC since 2010 would serve to attenuate both \n\ne-flows peaks, especially in the rainy season (see flow duration curves), and pollutants \n\nfiltration (see duration curves of N-NO3 loads). On the other hand, the more native forest \n\ncover, the lower water yield (Bayer, 2014; Molin, 2014; Burt&amp; Swank, 1992). Thus the \n\nprogressive augmentation of water yield between 2010 and 2035, in companion with higher \n\ntotal forest cover, would indicate other factors, such as forest connectivity, forest climax and \n\nsecondary factors like BMP,  that would produce non-linear conditions for water yield, from \n\nthe local scale to catchment scale. \n\nLikewise, water yield is related to the absolute value of integrating the flow duration \n\ncurve. For example, the flow duration curve of S1 (1990) exceeded other \u00a0 scenarios\u2019 \u00a0curves \u00a0in \u00a0\n\napproximately 75\u00a8% of time, with differentiated behaviour in both peak flows (lower \n\nprobability) and low flows (higher probability of duration curves). \n\n\n\n135 \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.13.

Results of a new index for hydrologic services assessment \n\nA new index for hydrologic service assessment is here developed as a simple relation \n\nbetween greyWF and water yield, using a fraction between water demand (numerator) and \n\navailability (denominator). Some authors commonly use this fraction as a direct approach to \n\nwater scarcity (i.e. Smakhtin, et al., 2005; Hoekstra et al, .2013; McNulty et al., 2010; among \n\nothers).  Therefore, we first assessed greyWF by respective drainage basins (Figure 5.15). \n\nThen we calculated the water pollution levels. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.15. Relationships between Grey Water Footprint for Nitrate (upper chart) and Total \nPhosphorous (lower chart) according to three LULC scenarios (Year 1990, 2010 and 2035) \nand size of the drainage areas of headwaters in the  Cantareira Water Supply System.\n\n\n\n138 \n \n\n \n  \nResults in Figure 5.16 show the composite water pollution level (WPLcomposite) \n\nversus drainage areas and compared with the HSI. The baseline WPLcomposite,ref is related \n\nto Domithildes catchment (horizontal, dotted line in Figure 5.16). This line divides the \ngraphic in two regions: less sustainable basins (HSI>0) and more sustainable basins (HIS<=0). \n\nMore sustainable basins (HIS<0) are Salto, Cachoeira nested catchments (Cachoeira dos \n\nPretos, Chal\u00e9 Ponto Verde and Ponte Cachoeira), as well as F28, F24 and Upper Jaguari \n\nbasin. \n\nFigure 5.16.

Despite using semi-distributed model for assessing non-point sources of pollution \n\nmainly tested under different LULC scenarios, our results showed that the intrinsic nature of \n\nflow-load duration curves, LULC and greyWP are constrained to high uncertainties and to \n\nnonlinearities both from in-situ sampling and from processes interactions of modelling. \n\nResults show the need of considering several uncertainty sources, such as: sensitivity analysis, \n\nobserved streamflow data, ecohydrologic model performance, residual analysis, etc. To attain \n\ngoals of EbA, using HSI through GWF assessment and composite of WPL, some conditions \n\nare needed, as follows: (i) to avoid the inputs of high-concentrated pollutants, especially \n\ngrowing urban settlements, (ii) to restore riparian vegetation and (iii) trapping and removing \n\ninflowing sediments. For rivers ecosystems health, we used HSI, flow regimes and \n\nWPLcomposite, as an alternative proposal of defining environmental flows (Tharme, 2003; \n\nOlden et al., 2011; Poff &amp; Zimmerman, 2010; Poff &amp; Matthews, 2013). Although the role of \n\nvegetation on streamflow has been intensely studied, very few investigations have been \n\nreported in Brazil which control nutrient sources, transportation and delivery. Furthermore, \n\nfrom the vision of integrating LULC, EbA and greyWF, further in-field and modeling \n\nframeworks are needed, thereby regarding the influence of vegetation on water quality and the \n\nrole of anthropogenic and natural drivers in catchment-scale ecohydrological processes. \n\n \n\n5.5.

CONCLUDING REMARKS \n\n\u201cThe solution of water-related challenges encompasses the environmental literacy, resources \nmanagement in a transdisciplinary way (Odum &amp; Barrett, 2014) and highlight the water focus on \nsustainability sciences.\u201d (Sivapalan et al., 2014) \n \n\nThis thesis is the first comprehensive, quali-quantitative, and multi-scale assessment on \n\nthe conversion of land use and its effects on hydrologic services in the overall Cantareira \n\nWater Supply System, South-East Brazil. Previous studies on freshwater in the Upper \n\nPiracicaba basin (where headwaters of Cantareira System are located) have focused on only \n\none or two catchments and only involve modelling or field works. \n\nField investigations as well as ecohydrologic simulation models are needed for a \n\ncomplete and reliable accounting to assess hydrological services. The evaluation of \n\nhydrological dynamics, which impacts hydrological services, is an interdisciplinary \n\nmanagement strategy to optimize the delivery of ecosystem services at catchment scales. This \n\nwas developed in four steps along this research. \n\nChapter 2 presents a review of ongoing payment for hydrological ecosystem services \n\nin the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and proposes ecohydrological insights which can make PES \n\n(Payment for Ecosystem Services) programs a promising tool for the conservation of water \n\nresources. First, Chapter 2 presents a concise overall summary of hydrological PES issues at \n\nthe Latin American and Brazilian national levels. Second, it presents a thorough overview of \n\nhydrological/PES in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome. I included in this review some \n\nprojects that, because they are not (yet) aligned with the guidelines of the Water Producer \n\nProgram, are rarely catalogued in publications. The findings presented here demonstrate that, \n\nalthough Brazilian PES projects for watershed protection have increased in the past decade, \n\nthey lack monitoring and adapting strategies to cope with water challenges in basins under \n\nchange. The lack of scientific knowledge and monitoring of hydrologic services (methods for \n\ntesting the delivery of hydro-services) are impediments that prevent strengthening PES for \n\nwatershed protection in Brazil. Third, I suggest a list of ecohydrological variables which \n\nwould help to delineate and rank hydrologic-PES projects, possibly helping reduce the \n\nvulnerability of land-use or climate change impacts, thereby focusing on the Ecosystem-based \n\nAdaption. At last, considering some difficulty to find comparable informations about Water-\n\n\n\n149 \n \n\n \n\nPES projects in the Brazil\u2019s Atlantic Forest, I recommend publishing Brazilian Water-PES in \n\npeer-reviewed journals to provide a broader audience to the initiatives, since new projects can \n\nlearn from the experiences of previously developed Water-PES projects. \n\nBased on the outcomes of Chapter 2, I then selected one hydrologic-PES issue in the \n\nBrazilian Atlantic Forest for an in-depth analysis, asking how anthropogenic disturbances at \n\ncatchment and watershed scales can influence the hydrologic services using both field \n\ninvestigations (Chapter 4) and ecohydrological watershed-scale models (Chapter 5). To \n\nanswer this question, I first developed a hydrological monitoring plan, which is the essence of \n\nChapter 3. Therefore, Chapter 3 introduces the Freshwater Monitoring Plan of the Water \n\nProducer/PCJ project. Based on this, it is then possible to evaluate the effects of the \n\nconservation project actions under the qualitative and quantitative aspects; and promote \n\nincorporating the elements from this plan in water resources planning and management. The \n\nproposed freshwater monitoring plan is sufficiently wide-ranging to be adapted and \n\nimplemented in other catchments which are eligible areas for PES projects. It is observed that \n\nthe inclusion of a group of interdisciplinary experts in medium and long term monitoring is \n\nneeded for producing more credible results. This planning is crucial to bring scientifically \n\nmeaningful, cost-effective baseline data and to implement effective monitoring \n\nprograms.Only if there are both, baseline and monitoring together, it is possible to verify the \n\nadditionality of the Water-PES project.  \n\nChapter 4 comprises the results of 17 nested catchment experiments during six field \n\ncampaigns, December 2012 \u2013 May 2014. The sampling sites are located in the drainage area \n\nof the Cantareira Water Supply System donor reservoirs, representatives of Jaguari, Cachoeira \n\nand Atibainha sub-basins. Comparing reference catchments with intervention catchments (i.e. \n\ncatchments that have participated in the Water Producer/PCJ project since 2009), it showed an \n\ninverse correlation between forest cover and water yield. This implies that water production \n\nwill possibly be lower with forest increase as a result of the Water Producer/PCJ project and \n\nother conservation synergies. However, water quality, ecosystems and humans can benefit \n\nfrom this expected forest increase. In this regard, the regionalization of phosphate and nitrate \n\nloads versus drainage area here proposed can indicate the pollutant load for any river stretch \n\nin the headwaters of Cantareira System. This nutrient migration from headwaters to \n\ndownstream areas can cause eutrophication effects in water supply reservoirs. The procedure \n\nof regionalized loads for rating curves can be an application guideline for the headwaters of \n\nother reservoirs in Brazil or abroad. Considering that these empirical evidences were analyzed \n\n\n\n150 \n \n\n \n  \n\nduring a period characterized as a low-precipitation anomaly in South-East Brazil, the results \n\nare even more informative and potentially useful for decision-makers in the future. \n\nFinally, Chapter 5 concludes that the water needed for regulating ecosystem services \ncan be estimated using the grey water footprint (non-consumptive water use) through a \n\ncomprehensive, simple and integrated assessment. 20 sub-basins in the Cantareira System \n\nwere simulated using SWAT (17 from the previous chapter plus the 3 reservoir sub-basins) in \n\nthree scenarios, past, present and future, where I incorporated EbA assumptions. On the one \n\nhand, nitrate leaching simulations, total phosphorous and sediments allowed the \n\nregionalization of grey water footprint (greyWF) of each pollutant at different spatial scales \n\nunder land-use/land-cover changes. On the other hand, the simulated conservation practices \n\nnot only predict additional, viable and best management practices, but also preventive and \n\nrobust decision-making for the headwaters of water supply systems. Despite some difficulty \n\nto access adequate quality input data for SWAT simulations, the scenarios allowed developing \n\na new ecohydrologic index for assessment of regulating ecosystem services. This index was \n\nbuilt from flow/load duration curves and the greyWF, and summarizes the knowledge \n\navailable in the adaptation measures. It can be the basis for future proper valuation and \n\nprotection of hydrologic services.  \n\nThis research has significantly expanded our understanding of subtropical streams \n\nfacing LULC pressures, by using cutting-edge technological tools (SWAT model and WF \n\nindicator) and experimental approach, endorsing ecohydrological monitoring in the \n\nheadwaters studied. Not only in terms of assessing the model outputs or greyWF estimates, \n\nbut also in terms of providing appropriate long term monitoring, there are many challenges to \n\novercome as well as opportunities for future research. Despite the need for a more detailed \n\nunderstanding of responses to anthropogenic impacts on water resources, it cannot be used as \n\nan excuse to delay conservation strategies and improved management, in light of the rapid \n\nloss rates of ecosystem services. \n\nThe conceptual model developed in this research is an effective auxiliary method for \n\nintegrated water resources management, to assure water quality and quantity security for both \n\nfreshwater ecosystems and humans in strategic catchments under change. Once more, I \n\nhighlight the cooperation of my co-advisor and advisor, co-authors, international journals \n\nreviewers and FAPESP advisor in this knowledge building process. Without them, this work \n\nwould not be possible.  \n\n\n\n151 \n \n\n \n\nAPPENDIX \u00a0A \u00a0- \u00a0Other \u00a0Outcomes \n\n1) Zaffani, A.G., Cruz, N.R., Taffarello, D. and Mendiondo, E.M.

Uncertainties in \nthe Generation of Pollutant Loads in the Context of Disaster Risk Management using \nBrazilian Nested Catchment Experiments under Progressive Change of Land-Use and Land-\nCover. J. Phys. Chem. Biophys, 5: 173. doi:10.4173/2161-0398.1000173. (ISSN: 2161-\n0398, I.F.: 0.96). \n\n \n \n\nABSTRACT \n \n\n \nRiver pollutant loads encompass a combination of natural and anthropogenic \n\nfactors related to land use and landcover (LULC). Progressive changes in LULC can \nsignificantly alter pollutant behaviors of changing flows and pollutant concentrations, \nreducing biodiversity, and emerging uncertainties regarded to poor gauged basins. To assess \nthe factors involved in the generation of pollutant loads, this paper examined empirical \nuncertainties from observed pollutant loads in river basins through nested catchment \nexperiments (NCE). Monitored river flows, concentration and drainage areas of each NCE \nwere associated with LULC in order to determine specific pollution generation coefficients \nper unit of drainage area (Ys) of BOD, a- chlorophyll, NTK, TSS, and Total Coliforms. Three \nBrazilian watersheds were tested with drainage areas ranging from 0.93 km  to 242 km , and \nunder different conditions of: (1) LULC (urban, forest and agricultural), (2) numbers of NCEs \n(2 to 11), (3) sampling seasons (1 to 4), (4) antecedent precipitation index (dry or wet \nconditions) and (5) biomes (Atlantic Forest and Cerrado-savanna). LULC appraisal showed \ncomplex upstream-downstream uncertainties of BOD, a-chlorophyll, and TSS from both \nurban and rural areas. Therefore, limitations of addressing representative values of specific \npollution loads were preliminarily regarded due to the lack of continuous spatiotemporal \nschemes of experimental data at NCEs linked to existing point-sources and progressive \nLULC. Conclusions of this paper would benefit decision-makers on adapting resilient-driven \nland use plans to cope with regional pollution disaster risk management in Brazilian river \nbasins. \n\n \n \n\nKeywords: Land-use and land-cover; pollutant load; nested catchment experiments. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n152 \n \n\n \n  \n\n2) Taffarello, D., Cunha, D.G.F., Calijuri, M.C. and Mendiondo, E.M.

Earth Syst. \nSci. (ISSN 1027-5606, I.F. 3.99). \n \n \n \n\nABSTRACT \n \n\n \nProtecting freshwater resources requires evaluating pollutant loads. This study aims \n\ntoassess a linking between load duration curves and grey water footprint based on \necohydrological indicators at watersheds under land use/land cover changes. There are some \nsteps to show the applicability of the methodology. First, we considered ecohydrological \nindicators of flood pulses across river cross-sections, floodplain and regime duration. Second, \nwe applied the methodology to compare total phosphorus-LDCs, TMDL and GWF at Jaguari \nRiver to other catchments in the Atlantic Forest biome. Third, we defined new \necohydrological indicators at 5%, 50% and 95% of time, namely, range of ecohydrological \nload ratio, (rELR), total ecohydrological flow variation (tEFV), and total ecohydrological \nload variation (tELV). On the one hand, rELR values decreased with catchment size, from \n5.63 at Jaguari River to 2.85 and 1.93 at larger scales.
