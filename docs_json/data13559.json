Thus systematic investigation of the main \n\nmanagement practices of dairy operations utilizing green or kiln dried sawdust in compost \n\nCBP barns at Kentucky state (USA) has proven to be of environmental and economic \n\nrelevance. The present work has as main objectives: a) Summarization of compost bed \n\ndata, barn dimension data and determination of the major interactive factors in the success \n\nof bed composting from qualitative and quantitative methods; b) Summarization of \n\nmoisture contents and water holding capacities of the compost bed to determine the \n\ninfluence of moisture on successful compost bed operation; c) Development of predictive \n\nequations for thermal properties of compost as a function of various combinations of \n\nmoisture content, compaction, and particle size; and d) Development of a three-\n\ndimensional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model of compost barn with alternate \n\nridge designs and visual demonstration of its impact on air flow through structure. Data for \n\nthis study was collected from 42 CBP barns, distributed throughout the state of Kentucky \n\n(USA) between October 2010 to March 2011. These data were used to describe the \n\nbuilding layouts and dimensions, identify barn management practices, and characterize the \n\ncompost bedding material concerning moisture content, WHC, particle size, thermal \n\nproperties, and others parameters. The average herd size found in the study was 90 cows \n\nand the breeds consisted of Jersey (6.8%), Holstein (72.7%), and mix (20.5%).The average \n\nCBP barn dimensions were 49.1 m (length) and 21.9 m (width). Majority of these barns \n\nhad feed alleys and driveways; overshot ridge with frequent orientation from NE to SW; \n\ngreen sawdust, kiln-dried sawdust, and mixture of both as most common bedding material; \n\nbedding process and aeration using mechanical tillage at depths lower than 0.25 m; and \n\nloading of fresh material added every one to five weeks, varying by season, weather \n\nconditions, barn size, and cow density. Temperatures of bedding compost tended to be \n\n\n\nix\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nlower on barns which utilized green sawdust. Average bedding moisture content was found \n\nto be 59.0% (w.b.) and ranged from 36.2 to 71.8%.  The percentage distributions of mass \n\nweight in the particle size fractions from the bedding compost materials were very different \n\nwhen compared among them. The average finer index (p &lt;0.05) was the highest weight \n\npercent (30.1%) in the samples studied. WHC increased with increasingly fine particle size. \n\nThe higher bulk density value was 3.6 times that of the lowest bulk density value. In \n\ngeneral, the thermal conductivity increased with increasing particle size, while thermal \n\nresistivity decreased with increasing particle size. An increasing trend in the thermal \n\nconductivity was also observed with the increase in both moisture content and static and \n\ndynamic compaction degree for all compost material tested. Whereas, an increasing trend \n\nin the thermal resistivity of bed compost was observed with the decrease in both moisture \n\ncontent and static and dynamic compaction degree. Bedding compost always contained \n\nbacteria, moreover Coliforms count was not present in barns that had a higher compost \n\ntemperature and Coliforms, E. coli, Bacillus and Streptococcus count were higher in the \n\nbarns that showed lower moisture content. The developed barn ventilation CFD model \n\nprovided good agreement with experimental measurements and it was able to identify the \n\neffect on air flow through structure in a CBP barns with  alternative roof ridge type. The \n\nCFD models results showed that the best  ridge vent and wind direction in the winter \n\nweather was observed in the open ridge with chimney (ORC) and West to East, \n\nrespectively.  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nx\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nRESUMO \n\n \n\nDAMASCENO, Fl\u00e1vio Alves, D.Sc., Universidade Federal de Vi\u00e7osa, Agosto, 2012. \nGalp\u00f5es com sistema de cama com compostagem e simula\u00e7\u00e3o computacional do fluxo \ndo ar atrav\u00e9s de modelo reduzido naturalmente ventilado.

Sendo assim, a \n\ninvestiga\u00e7\u00e3o sistem\u00e1tica das principais pr\u00e1ticas de manejo das opera\u00e7\u00f5es de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nleite empregando-se serragem verde ou seca nos compostos de instala\u00e7\u00f5es do tipo CBP no \n\nestado de Kentucky (USA) tem demonstrado ser de grande interesse econ\u00f4mico e \n\nambiental. O presente trabalho teve como objetivos principais: a) Sumarizar os dados do \n\ncomposto da cama, dimens\u00e3o das instala\u00e7\u00f5es e determinar os principais fatores interativos \n\npara o sucesso do composto da cama a partir de m\u00e9todos qualitativos e quantitativos; b) \n\nSumarizar a capacidade de reten\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua do composto da cama (WHC) e comparar dos \n\nteores de umidade encontrados com a WHC, a fim de determinar a influ\u00eancia da umidade \n\nsobre o composto da cama; c) Desenvolvimento de equa\u00e7\u00f5es de previs\u00e3o para propriedades \n\nt\u00e9rmicas em composto de cama em fun\u00e7\u00e3o de varias combina\u00e7\u00f5es de teor de umidade, \n\ncompacta\u00e7\u00e3o e tamanho de part\u00edcula; e d) Desenvolvimento de um modelo em tr\u00eas \n\ndimens\u00f5es em din\u00e2mica de flu\u00eddos computacional (CFD) de instala\u00e7\u00f5es em compostagem \n\ncom projetos alternativos de cumeeira e demonstra\u00e7\u00e3o visual do impacto do fluxo do ar \n\nsobre a estrutura. Dados para realiza\u00e7\u00e3o deste estudo foram coletados em 42 instala\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nCBP, distribu\u00eddos atrav\u00e9s do estado de Kentucky, entre outubro de 2010 e mar\u00e7o de 2011. \n\nEstas informa\u00e7\u00f5es foram usadas para descrever o esbo\u00e7o e as dimens\u00f5es das instala\u00e7\u00f5es, \n\nidentificar as pr\u00e1ticas de manejo e caracterizar o material de compostagem da cama quanto \n\nao teor de umidade, capacidade de reten\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua (WHC), tamanho da part\u00edcula, \n\npropriedades t\u00e9rmicas, entre outros par\u00e2metros. A m\u00e9dia de tamanho do rebanho \n\nencontrado nesse estudo foi de 90 vacas com propor\u00e7\u00e3o de 6,8% de Jersey, 72,7% de \n\nHolstein e 20,5% de mistura destas ra\u00e7as. A m\u00e9dia das dimens\u00f5es das camas de \n\ncompostagem foram 49,1 m (comprimento) e 21,9 m (largura). A maioria destas \n\n\n\nxi\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ninstala\u00e7\u00f5es tinham corredores de alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o e acesso de ve\u00edculos, cumeeiras do tipo \n\n\u201covershot\u201d (com um dos lados ultrapassado) e  frequ\u00eancia de orienta\u00e7\u00e3o de NE para SO, \n\nserragem verde, seca ou mista como materiais mais comuns da cama, preparo da cama por \n\naera\u00e7\u00e3o mec\u00e2nica a profundidade menores do que 0,25 m e carga de material fresco \n\nadicionado a cada uma ou cinco semanas, variando por esta\u00e7\u00e3o do ano, condi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nclim\u00e1tica, tamanho da instala\u00e7\u00e3o e densidade animal. As temperaturas dos compostos das \n\ncamas tenderam ser menores em instala\u00e7\u00f5es que utilizaram serragem verde. A umidade \n\nm\u00e9dia do material da cama foi de 59,0% (b.u.), variando de 36,3% a 71,8%. A compara\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nda distribui\u00e7\u00e3o percentual do peso (massa) nas frac\u00f5es de tamanho de part\u00edcula revelou que \n\nesses materiais de compostagem da cama encontrados nas instala\u00e7\u00f5es CBP foi muito \n\ndiferentes. Assim, a m\u00e9dia do \u00edndice de finura (p &lt;0.05) foi a porcentagem de peso mais \n\nalta (30.1%) nas amostras estudadas. WHC aumentou com o aumento de part\u00edculas finas. O \n\nmaior valor de densidade aparente da cama foi 3,6 vezes maior que o menor valor de \n\ndensidade aparente encontrado. Em geral, a condutividade t\u00e9rmica aumentou com aumento \n\ndo tamanho da part\u00edcula, enquanto a resistividade t\u00e9rmica diminuiu com o aumento do \n\ntamanho da part\u00edcula. Uma tend\u00eancia de aumento na condutividade t\u00e9rmica foi ainda \n\nobservada com o aumento no conte\u00fado de umidade e grau de compacta\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1tica e \n\ndin\u00e2mica para todos os materiais de compostos testados. Por outro lado, uma tend\u00eancia de \n\naumento na resistividade t\u00e9rmica do composto da cama foi observada com a diminui\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\nconte\u00fado de umidade e do grau de compacta\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1tica e din\u00e2mica. Os materiais da cama \n\nsempre mostraram presen\u00e7a de bact\u00e9rias, sendo que as contagens de Coliformes n\u00e3o \n\nestavam presentes em instala\u00e7\u00f5es que possu\u00edam compostos com temperaturas mais \n\nelevadas e as contagens Coliformes, E. coli, Bacilo e Estreptococos foram maiores nas \n\ninstala\u00e7\u00f5es que apresentaram menores teores de umidade. O desenvolvimento do modelo \n\nem CFD permitiu uma boa concord\u00e2ncia com medi\u00e7\u00f5es experimentais e foi capaz de \n\nidentificar os efeitos do fluxo de ar atrav\u00e9s da estrutura em instala\u00e7\u00f5es CBP com diferentes \n\ntipos de cumeeiras. Os resultados dos modelos CFD mostraram que a melhor tipo de \n\ntelhado e dire\u00e7\u00e3o do vento no durante o periodo de inverno foi observado em cumeeira \n\naberta com chamin\u00e9 (ORC) e oeste para leste, respectivamente. \n\n\n\n1\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n1 - INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\n1.1 Summary and justification \n\nIn the late 1980`s, innovative dairy producers in the state of Virginia introduced a new \n\nvariation on the loose-housing dairy system generally referred to as a compost bedded pack \n\n(CBP) barn. Since then, CBP barns are being used in many states in the United States, \n\nespecially in the Midwest and Northeast, and in other countries such as Japan, China, \n\nGermany, Italy, Netherlands, Israel, and recently in Brazil. The first CBP barns of \n\nKentucky were constructed in 2002. By the end of 2010, CBP barn number had been \n\nincreased to 58 barns. This significant increase was an indicative that a CBP barn may be a \n\nreasonable, economically feasible alternative type of dairy housing facility for Kentucky \n\ndairy producers wanting to upgrade or modernize their milking herd facilities. As \n\nconsequence, factors based on dairy producer experiences such as current design, \n\nmanagement recommendations of manure compost packs, animal behavior, herd health, \n\nand milk production has been described in some publications (Russelle et al., 2009). \n\nAdditional field observations have also been reported in several U.S. states (Shane et al., \n\n2010; Barberg et al., 2007; Janni et al., 2007) and specially in Kentucky (Black et al., \n\n2011a; Black et al., 2011b; Bewley and Taraba, 2009).  \n\n CBP barn structures generally have a retaining wall that typically surrounds the bed \n\nand also separates the feed alley from the composted manure pack. The most commonly \n\nemployed bedding material in the composting process is green and dry sawdust or kiln \n\ndried shavings to maintain a dry bedding surface and to absorb water. However, producers \n\noften ask whether green sawdust (high moisture sawdust from sawing green wood) is \n\nharmful or beneficial to the composting bed. The primary difference between green and \n\nkiln dried sawdust is that green sawdust will not absorb as much water as kiln-dried \n\nsawdust. All that this implies is that to achieve the same compost bed moisture content, \n\nmore green sawdust will be used than kiln dried sawdust.  \n\nCompost packs produced by composting are tilled or stirred twice daily to incorporate \n\nthe manure, provide a fresh, soft surface, and aerate the pack to encourage aerobic \n\nmicrobial activity in the pack (Janni et al., 2007). Compared to windrow composting, CBP \n\nhas a larger surface area to heat generating volume, thus more heat losses. Since the \n\ntemperature is one of the most important CBP operational parameters, the understanding of \n\n\n\n2\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nthe thermal properties and heat balance in compost systems is required to design and \n\nproperly control the composting processes (Ahn et al., 2009; Janni et al., 2007). \n\nAdditionally, the key to maintaining a good working CBP barn include, a structure \n\ndesigned with an open ridge and high open side walls, enhanced ventilation, frequent bed \n\nstirring, optimal moisture in the bedded pack, appropriate biodegradability of the \n\nbedding/manure bed mixture, and optimal animal density.  \n\n Therefore, the effectiveness of the composting process is dependent upon the \n\nenvironmental conditions as oxygen content, moisture, temperature, amount of organic \n\nmatter, and the size and activity of microbial populations presents within the CBP (Janni et \n\nal., 2005). Composting increases the bedding temperature which reduces pathogenic \n\nmicrobial populations, and decreases bedding moisture by increased drying rate (Black et \n\nal., 2011a; Barberg at al., 2007). The large numbers of microorganisms and high microbial \n\nactivity in the compost bedding are largely a reflection of manure deposition, bedding \n\nchemical properties (available C and N), and water contents. Facultative anaerobic bacteria \n\nalso are more numerous in the surface of CBP material and constitute a larger proportion of \n\nthe total microbial population in tilled or stirred compost (NRCS, 2010). Some research \n\nshows the direct influence of poor environment conditions that could be created within the \n\nCBP as one of the factors that predispose the development of respiratory diseases in birds \n\nand pigs (Reece et al., 1980; Sainsbury, 1981; Takai et al., 1983; Menegali et al., 2009), but \n\na thorough search of the literature found few studies related to air quality in facilities for \n\ncattle. \n\n A more in-depth study is needed to assess and correlate detailed information regarding \n\nthe building structure, bed management, and compost parameters of these housing systems \n\nand to determine the most significant factors that achieve CBP success. Thus, the findings \n\nof this research may be used by current and future compost bedded pack barn managers.  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n3\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n1.2 Dissertation objectives \n\nThe present work will provide a systematic investigation of the main management \n\npractices of dairy operations utilizing green or kiln dried sawdust in their compost bedded \n\npack barns. Four major objectives were established: \n\n \n\n1) Summarization of compost bed data, barn dimension data and determination of the \n\nmajor interactive factors in the success of bed composting from qualitative and quantitative \n\nmethods; \n\n \n\n2) Summarization of moisture contents and water holding capacities of the compost bed \n\nto determine the influence of moisture on successful compost bed operation; \n\n \n\n3) Development of predictive equations for thermal properties of compost as a function \n\nof various combinations of moisture content, compaction, and particle size; \n\n \n\n4) Development of a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model of \n\ncompost barn with alternate ridge designs and visual demonstration of its impact on air \n\nflow through structure. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n4\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n2 - LITERATURE REVIEW \n\n \n\n2.1. Compost dairy barn system \n\nFor the past several decades, loose housing systems of dairy cattle has given way to \n\nfreestall barns in light of less labor, cleaner cows and reduced bedding costs when \n\ncompared to the conventional straw bedded-pack. Nevertheless, loose housing with \n\nfreestalls can still lead to a high risk of lameness and hock lesion. Since the concrete \n\nflooring systems are constantly covered with urine and manure, this type system may cause \n\ndigital dermatitis and other hoof disorders (Klaas et al., 2010), especially with inadequate \n\npositioning of stall hardware, limited area resting space, hard lying surface or insufficient \n\nbedding (Weary and Taszkun, 2000; Tucker et al., 2004; Dippel et al., 2009). In view of \n\nthis, a new concept in loose housing called compost bedded dairy barn system, commonly \n\ncalled compost barns or compost bedded pack barns (CBP), has been gaining attention \n\nfrom dairy producers and the scientific community. \n\nCBP barns are an alternative loose housing system for dairy cows. In CBP barns, cows \n\nhave more freedom of movement and are able to lie down in a more natural manner. In \n\ntheory, this should lead to cows spending more time lying down. However, even as cows \n\nare standing up, they also spend more time on a softer surface than in concrete alleys \n\nwithin freestall barns. Thus, cow welfare and health are important indications of the \n\ncompost bed. Bedding quality can also be decreased as the moisture content increase once \n\nthe cows are directly exposed to the elements constituting of bedding, feces and urine \n\nresulting in an increase in the bacterial cells counts of both bedding and teats (Zdanowicz \n\net al., 2004). But, when CBP barns are properly managed, drier bedding material is present \n\nand may result in decrease of the milk somatic cell counts (SCC), cleaner cows, increased \n\nmilk production, and reduced lameness. A published example of this was found in \n\nMinnesota where the percentage of mastitis infection rates in CBP barns was 12% lower \n\nthan in freestall herds (Barberg et al., 2007). \n\nCBP barns are generating a lot of interest among Kentucky dairy producers who are \n\nadopting CBP barns as dairy cattle housing at a rapid rate. Kentucky has at least fifty one \n\ncompost barns in operation and some more under construction. Experience with well-\n\nmanaged CBP barns in Kentucky has generally been positive. Cows are relatively clean, \n\nvery comfortable, have fewer lameness issues, and in most cases has increased milk \n\n\n\n5\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nproduction and lower SCC after moving from tie-stall or freestall barns, or pasture based \n\nsystems to a compost barn. \n\nHowever, since this is a new system, many questions still remain regarding best \n\nmanagement practices and key factors for their success. More research is needed on these \n\nhousing systems after assessing the effect of current design and management \n\nrecommendations based on dairy producer experiences. As result, CBP barn \n\nrecommendations can be made for proper design, location, and exceptional management. \n\nThus, the keys to maintaining a good working CBP barn should include a structure \n\ndesigned with an open ridge and high open side walls, enhanced ventilation, frequent bed \n\nstirring, optimal moisture in the bedded pack, and optimal animal density (Wagner, 2002) \n\nin order to provide a healthy, comfortable surface on which cows may be kept to result in \n\nwith a higher quality of life and milk production. \n\n \n\n2.1.1. Facility design \n\nCBP barns are similar in many respects to typical freestall dairy barns (NRAES-76, \n\n1995; MWPS-7, 2000). Both have feed mangers, feed alleys and waterers. One of the key \n\ndifferences is that the freestall and freestall alleys are replaced with a bedded pack area in \n\nCBP barns which it is aerated at least twice daily.  \n\nCBP barns have a concrete feed alley, a composting bedded pack, a 1.20 m high wall \n\nsurrounds the pack on three sides and one side that separates the pack from the  feed alley. \n\nThe 1.20 m wall the bedded pack and the feed alley has a fence for safety to prevent cows \n\nfrom walking over the wall (Endres and Janni, 2009). The wall separating the pack and the \n\nfeed alley has one to four walkways for cows and equipment to access the pack. This wall \n\nis typically of poured concrete construction. \n\nA feed alley is located along one long side of the bedded pack. CBP barns can be laid \n\nout for drive-by feeding, covered feeding, or drive-through feeding with pens on both sides. \n\nThey can also be used with outside feed bunks under roof. The recommended feed alley \n\nwidth is 4.25 m because cows eat off one side of the alley and drink from waterers on the \n\nother side (Gay, 2009). \n\nThe bedded pack area can have a concrete or clay base. The sidewall height for a \n\nbedded pack is recommended to be higher than that for a freestall barn to accommodate the \n\nsidewall opening lost due to the manure pack walls. A size 0.91 m or more of eave \n\n\n\n6\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\noverhangs is recommended to minimize the chance of roof runoff and rain being blown \n\nonto the bedded pack (Janni et al., 2005). Roof gutters will help reduce roof runoff from \n\nbeing blown onto the pack. The ground surrounding a compost barn should be sloped to \n\nminimize rain and snow runoff from entering the barn and wetting the bedded pack (Endres \n\nand Janni, 2009). Dairy producers in Minnesota have used 4.25 m sidewalls but some \n\nproducers have used 4.90 m for their next barn to provide better access for bedding trucks. \n\nWalkways, at least 3.05 m to 3.65 m wide, are minimum recommended at each end of the \n\nwall separating the bedded pack and the feed alley for cow and equipment access to the \n\npack area. Long barns will require additional walkways (Endres and Janni, 2009). \n\n \n\n2.1.2. Waterers \n\nWater intake increases during heat stress, and one of the critical factors in managing \n\nheat stress is to provide adequate access to water. Economy and ruggedness are two criteria \n\nfor selection of  the waterers. Two choices for materials are concrete or plastic. Concrete is \n\nmore rugged for the long term but requires more skill and equipment for forming and \n\nplacing. Plastic can be easy to modify or repaired and economically viable. \n\nWaterers located closer to the feed alley are easier to inspect from the alley and \n\ncleaning can be performed more easily. Many CBP barns have the waterers along the \n\nretaining wall with access from, the feed alley, usually within an indented space . Waterers \n\nare not located in the bedded pack area to minimize wetting of the pack, to keep cleaner \n\nwaterers, and to avoid having to adjust waterer height as pack depth increases. Ideally, 0.60 \n\nmeters of tank perimeter should be provided for each 10 to 20 cows (Brouk et al., 2001). \n\n \n\n2.1.3. Lighting \n\nLighting in compost barns is similar to that used in freestall barns (MWPS-7, 2000). \n\nLighting in CBP barns is desired mainly for the convenience of the operator, for inspecting \n\nanimals and handling dairy cows. Dairy producers, veterinarians, and other animal care \n\nworkers often report easier and better cow observation and care. Cows move more easily \n\nthrough uniformly lit entrances and exits.  \n\nEnhanced lighting for the milking herd is profitable (Dahl et al., 1997). The increased \n\nmilk production generates a payback of less than one year considering initial, installation, \n\n\n\n7\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\noperating, and replacement costs of the lights, and the increased feed intake (Chastain and \n\nHiatt, 1998). \n\nLight levels are measured in lux. The power and type of the lamp determines the \n\nbrightness. The height of the lamp above the ground and the lamp spacing determines the \n\nuniformity and distribution of light (Winchell et al., 1996). Yard lights should therefore be \n\nlocated over feed alleys and/or waterers. \n\n \n\n2.1.4. CBP barn ventilation and location \n\nDetermining the best CBP barn ventilation system to employ is one of the biggest \n\nfacility related decisions to make it. The ventilation in the CBP barns helps in maintaining \n\na healthy and comfortable environment for cows and reduces the effect of environment on \n\nthe structure of the building. The renewal of the air removes cow heat and moisture as well \n\nas the odor, gases, heat and moisture that the composting pack generates. It is necessary to \n\nconstantly exchange warm, humid air inside the barn for cooler, drier air outside of the \n\nbarn. This exchange must occur regardless of outside temperature or weather conditions. \n\nA continuous supply of fresh air is necessary whenever animals are closely confined, as \n\nin CBP barn, in order to maintain animal health and integrity of the building. Evidence of \n\ninadequate ventilation includes condensation or condensation stains on walls, ceilings and \n\nstructural members, and mainly the presence of foul odors in the barn. Perennial respiratory \n\ndiseases may be another symptom of poor ventilation. Winter barn temperatures should not \n\nexceed 10\u00b0C. If this temperature is often exceeded, inadequate ventilation may be the \n\nreason (Wells, 2004). \n\nThe rate of ventilation is the air volume changed in a given period of time. The \n\nventilation system in dairy barns may be natural or mechanical ventilation (positive or \n\nnegative), or a combination of both (Teye and Hautala, 2008), as seen in Figure 2.1. \n\nA mechanical ventilating system uses fans to provide air exchange. Both naturally and \n\nmechanically ventilated buildings need properly sized openings for fresh air to enter and \n\nexhaust air to exit. Ventilating system control can be accomplished either automatically or \n\nmanually. Mechanical ventilating systems almost always use thermostatic control while \n\nnatural ventilating systems are commonly adjusted manually (MWPS-7, 2000). \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n8\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n(a) (b) \n\n \n(c) \n\nFigure 2.1 - Ventilation system in dairy barns: (a) negative pressure, (b) positive and (c) \nnatural (Adapted from Teye, 2008). \n\n \n\n2.1.4.1. Natural ventilation in CBP barns \n\nIn a natural ventilating system, the wind and the difference between inside and outside \n\ntemperature moves air through the building. Natural air exchange or building ventilation \n\nrates are influenced sidewall opening, eave opening, building width, ridge opening, and \n\nwind speed (Brouk et al., 2001). \n\nWind blowing across the open ridge and sidewall and endwall openings, and \n\nindoor/outdoor temperature differences moves air through the building to provide the air \n\nexchange. Fresh air enters through eave or sidewall openings, see Figure 2.1c. \n\nHeat, moisture, and air contaminants exits through the open ridge and downwind \n\nsidewall opening. Some ventilation occurs even on calm days because warm, moist air rise \n\nup causing a chimney effect. Large, adjustable or full sidewall openings allow increased air \n\nmovement due to wind in summer. Continuous openings help provide good fresh air \n\ndistribution. \n\n \na) Location and Sitting \n\nThe most CBP barns are naturally ventilated, which makes location very important. \n\nNaturally ventilated barns are located in an open area where summer winds can blow \n\nthrough open sidewalls and the ridge in warm weather (Teye, 2008). Building location is \n\n\n\n9\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ncritical for natural ventilation to work well. Buildings on high ground are located where \n\ntrees or structures do not disturb airflow around or through the building.  \n\nTrees, silos, tall growing crops, and other structures can disrupt airflow for a distance \n\nof 5 to 10 times their height downwind. Thus, naturally ventilated buildings should be \n\nlocated at least 25 meters, in any direction, from such obstructions (MWPS-7, 2000). \n\n \nb) Building Orientation \n\nThe first dairy barn design criteria to be considered are the orientation of the structure. \n\nBarns with a north-south orientation have a greater internal solar radiation exposure than \n\nbarns with a east-west orientation (Brouk et al., 2001). Moreover, building orientation \n\naffects natural ventilating system performance. Orient naturally ventilated buildings to \n\nprovide maximum wind exposure, especially for summer winds. Greater and more uniform \n\nwind driven air exchange occurs when the wind enters through the continuous sidewall or \n\neave opening rather than through the smaller end wall. Cross ventilation, from side to side, \n\nis especially important during warm weather. Orient buildings so prevailing summer winds \n\nare perpendicular to the ridge openings (MWPS-7, 2000). \n\nThe ideal orientation of the barn allows prevailing summertime winds to intersect the \n\nbarn perpendicular to the sidewalls. When the farmer builds the barn using this orientation, \n\nthe air entering the barn though the sidewall travels the shortest distance possible to exit the \n\nbarn through the opposite sidewall. This improves the rate of air exchange in the barn and \n\nconsequently enhances the environment of the cows. Since winds change direction, winds \n\nstriking the sidewall within 45 degrees of the perpendicular will still result in adequate air \n\nexchange in most cases. Other factors that can affect barn orientation include future \n\nexpansion, topography, cow flow, and manure flow. Producers should consider all of these \n\nfactors when sitting and orientating their barns. \n\n \nc) Ventilation Openings \n\nThe primary types of openings used in a naturally ventilated dairy barn are eave, ridge, \n\nand wall openings (sidewall and endwall). Controlling the size of these openings can \n\ncontrol the ventilation rate to a great extent. The amount of inlet control needed depends on \n\nthe season of the year and the climate (Chastain, 2000). \n\nIn addition to building width and sidewall height, ridge openings are required. \n\nArmstrong et al. (1999) observed greater increases in afternoon respiration rates relative to \n\n\n\n10\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nmorning rates when cows were housed in barns with ridge coverings as compared to \n\nopening ridges. A ridge opening of at least 0.15 m (measured horizontally) should be \n\nprovided for each 9.0 m of building width (Chastain, 2000) and  the bedded pack area or \n\nother less critical areas should also located under the ridge (Brouk et al., 2001).  \n\nThe sidewall opening should be at least 2.50 meters high, continuous the entire length \n\nof the building. Open sidewalls fully to provide maximum summer ventilation. With large \n\nsidewall openings, provide a 0.90 to 1.20 meters overhang at the eave to shade and partially \n\nshield the opening from blowing rain and snow piles and drifts. Ventilation through \n\nexisting buildings can be improved by increasing the amount of open area, but do not \n\ncompromise the structural integrity of the building. Endwall openings can provide \n\nadditional ventilation to supplement sidewall openings in the summer (MWPS-7, 2000). \n\nThe vertical separation between the eave and ridge openings has a significant impact on \n\nthe pressure differences generated by the chimney effect (Chastain, 1987). Therefore, the \n\nroof slope is an important consideration in the design of a naturally ventilated building \n\n(Chastain, 2000). Roof slopes of 4/12 to 6/12 works very well in naturally ventilated dairy \n\nbarns. Condensation and high interior summer temperatures are more likely with roof \n\nslopes less than 4/12 because of reduced air movement. Buildings with roof slopes steeper \n\nthan 6/12 have greater chimney effect but they are generally not needed. Slopes of 3/12 are \n\nacceptable for open front buildings less than 9.0 m wide (MWPS-7, 2000).  \n\nDetermine ventilation rates in naturally ventilated facilities is a task even more difficult \n\n(Albright, 1990; Zhang et al., 2005). The air flow in CBP barn naturally ventilated is \n\nirregular and multidirectional, and generally has a very small value to measure accurately. \n\nVentilation is also driven by temperature differences between indoor and outdoor \n\ninstallation. Therefore, to accurately estimate the natural ventilation is very difficult, \n\nbecause the areas of ventilation openings are large and along the entire length of the \n\ninstallation or through the ridge vent. Most CBP barns which has ventilation problems are \n\nresulted from poor design, construction or ventilation operational control system (Seedorf \n\net al., 1998). \n\n  \n2.1.4.2. Mechanical ventilation in CBP barns \n\nThere are endless approaches to the mechanical ventilation design in dairy farming. For \n\nexample, the precise number and location of fans required in a building would depend upon \n\nfactors such as the density, construction, utilization and local climatic conditions (Wells, \n\n\n\n11\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n2004). However, the components of the ventilation system should accommodate winter and \n\nsummer conditions, such as: \n\ni) A continuous minimum air exchange: This is certainly required to remove the \n\nmoisture constantly created by dairy cows, particularly during the colder, sub-freezing \n\nmonths of the year. \n\nii) Higher air exchange rates and air velocity across the cows during the hotter summer \n\nweather to remove excessive heat from the cows. \n\n \nMechanical ventilating systems have fans, controls, and air inlets or outlets. A well-\n\ndesigned system provides greater control over barn temperature and air movement than \n\nnatural ventilation (MWPS-32, 2000). Mechanical ventilation is used to ventilate barns or \n\nrooms with flat ceilings and buildings that are blocked from good natural ventilation by \n\nexisting buildings and obstructions. \n\nFans are the driving force in providing the required air exchange and it must be \n\ncombined with properly sized and distributed fresh air inlets in order to work properly. The \n\nmain criteria for selecting ventilation fans are capacity to provide a good air throw, fan \n\nsize, drive type, and purchase and operating costs. In barns with tight construction and \n\ncontinuous, fan location has little effect on air distribution. Fans placed in groups or banks \n\nat a single location are preferred rather than spacing them out singly at different locations \n\n(Wells, 2004). Thus, fans should be selected to provide the required air volume for \n\ndifferent weather conditions based on the number of cows in the barn. \n\nThe minimum ventilation rates for dairy cows are given in Table 2.1. Recommended \n\nventilation rates depend primarily upon the total weight of livestock housed in the space to \n\nbe ventilated. \n\n \nTable 2.1 - Minimum ventilation rates for dairy barns. \n\nAnimals Winter Mild weather Summer \n Air flow (m3 s-1) per animal \nCalves (0 - 2 months) 0.007 0.024 0.047 \nHeifers    \n\n(2 - 12 months) 0.009 0.028 0.061 \n(12 - 24 months) 0.014 0.038 0.085 \n\nCows 0.024 0.080 0.236 \nSource: Dairy freestall housing and equipment handbook (MWPS-7, 2000). \n\n \n\n\n\n12\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nA recent innovation for hot weather cooling in CBP barns is the High Volume Low \n\nSpeed (HVLS) ceiling fan (Figure 2.3). These fan units may be up to 7.2 m in diameter and \n\nthey are operated by a 1 to 2 hp motor (Clarke and House, 2010). While the units are \n\nexpensive to purchase, the payback period falls into the 4 to 5 year range, depending on the \n\nelectricity prices and installation costs at the time. HVLS fans create a higher percentage of \n\nfloor area with fewer dead or low velocity spaces. \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n(b) (c) \nFigure 2.2 - High Volume Low Speed (HVLS) ceiling fan (a) and differences before (b) \n\nand (c) after the installation HVLS in CBP barns. \n \n\nThe Figure 2.2 illustrates a typical dairy herd enclosure in the height of the summer \n\nmonths without mechanical circulation. Thereby, before ceiling fans (HVLS) are installed \n\n(Figure 2.2b), the warm, muggy air sits in the building, which creates uncomfortable \n\nconditions for the cattle, creating heat stress for the animals, attracting flies, whilst also \n\ncreating uncomfortable working conditions for staff. By installing ceiling fans within the \n\nenclosure (Figure 2.2c), this provides positive air movement, equalizing the temperature \n\nlevels within the building during the summer for cattle and workers, with better cooling to \n\nminimize heat stress with the constant air circulation. \n\n\n\n13\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n2.1.5. Economic considerations \n\nNumerous economic factors must be considered before deciding to build a CBP barn. \n\nCBP barns have lower capital costs compared to freestall barns because CBP barns require \n\nless concrete and stall equipment. In other words, the bedded pack can be built up on clay. \n\nFurthermore, there is less investment in manure storage structures because the bedded pack \n\nprovides storage (Gay, 2009). \n\nBedding costs and availability of bedding materials was by far the major concern \n\nexpressed by the producers. Dairies with more than 200 cows may want to consider an \n\nalternative bedding to a CBP barn if they plan to use a compost barn for all their cows. A \n\nlarge number of cows will produce enough manure to require a significant amount of \n\nbedding material. In CBP barns, approximately three to four times more bedding is used in \n\na CBP barn as in a freestall barn. Alternative bedding options are currently being tested. \n\nPreliminary results indicate that sawdust is the best option for these types of barn, but \n\ncombinations of sawdust with other materials, such as finely ground soybean or flax straw, \n\nfinely processed corn cobs, or wood chip fines can work relatively well (Endres and Janni, \n\n2009). \n\nThe building costs ranged widely depending on the amount of on-farm labor utilized \n\nand amenities added. Labor requirements are similar for both types of barns. Properly \n\nmaintained CBP barns require more daily labor (packs must be stirred twice daily and must \n\nhave dry bedding added). However, less daily labor is required for manure handling. \n\nProducers should also consider the cost of handling manure. CBP barns reduce the \n\namount of manure storage, but producers may need equipment to handle both liquid and \n\ndry manure. Keep in mind that dry manure can be easier to handle and may not have to be \n\napplied as frequently (Bewley and Taraba, 2009). \n\n \n\n2.2. Compost bedding pack \n\n2.2.1. Bedding source \n\nThere are two driving factors behind good bedding choices. One is cow comfort, and \n\nthe other is farmer comfort. Both of these objectives have some common and diverging \n\nareas. Cow comfort is critical because of the importance to both cow and farmer for the \n\ncow to spend time to lie down and performing the process of rumination. Therefore \n\nbedding must be comfortable to lie on. Nonabrasive bedding promotes both comfort and \n\n\n\n14\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ninjury reduction. A dry bedding surface is critical at all times both for cow comfort, \n\nreduction of infection from environmental mastitis organisms and for reduction in pathogen \n\ngrowth. Farmer comfort requires low bedding cost, labor efficiency, and the bedding drain \n\nor dry well to keep cows dry and limit growth of pathogens (Hashemi et al., 2001). \n\nBesides, drainage of bedding can be considered a negative factor, because regulatory \n\nagencies requires protection from groundwater contamination. Thus, operation of the bed \n\nshould be below the water holding capacity (WHC). \n\nFine wood shavings or sawdust is most commonly used in CBP barns as a bedding \n\nmaterial (Janni et al., 2005). Wood shavings are preferred over sawdust because the small \n\nsize of sawdust particles can enhance bacterial growth and irritate teat ends. Sawdust \n\nshould be kiln-dried if used as bedding. However, competition for wood products has \n\nstiffened, driving up the price for wood residue. This calls into question the future cost and \n\navailability of this bedding. Faced with this uncertainty, producers and researchers have \n\nexplored alternative materials that could work for bedding in CBP barns (Vokey, 2008). \n\nSome experience indicates that green or wet sawdust is not recommended. Other types of \n\nbedding may not work satisfactorily, increasing the mastitis risk for dairy cows. \n\n \n2.2.2. Management of the bedded pack \n\nManagement of the composting bedded-pack is critical to the success of compost barns. \n\nThe minimum space per cow for a CBP barn is recommended to be 6.0 m2 per animal for \n\nJersey cows and 7.9 m2 for large breeds (Janni et al., 2007). However, 9.3 m2 or more per \n\ncow is recommended to prevent overcrowding and compaction of the bedding (Gay, 2009). \n\nOvercrowding may lead to increased SCC levels, increased bedding needs and potential for \n\nincreased teat injury. The compost pack area is sized to allow all cows to lie down at the \n\nsame time and still have space for a cow to get up to go and eat or drink. It is hypothesized \n\nthat compost pack area per animal depends on the amount of manure and urine added to the \n\npack daily. Moreover, more space per animal will reduce the frequency of bedding addition \n\nas a result of water evaporation rate, as affected by weather conditions and bed \n\ntemperature, that may be comparable to deposition rate from manure and urine. The \n\nmicrobial activity and drying need to balance the amount of manure and urine added daily. \n\nCBP barns have bedding covering the loose housing floor to an initial depth of 0.30 to \n\n0.60 m. Cows deposit manure and urine onto the bedding when utilizing the CBP barn. \n\nSometimes confinement in the barn is continuous between milking sessions. When cows \n\n\n\n15\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nare in the barn, they have free access to a concrete alley where waterers and the feed bunk \n\nare installed. While the cows are being milked (two or three times per day), the bedded \n\npack is tilled or stirred to incorporate the urine and manure that accumulate between \n\nmilkings and to aerate the bedding material. Tillage is done with a skid steer, small tractor, \n\nor even an ATV equipped with a variety of tools (field cultivators, harrows, and rototillers \n\nhave been employed), to a depth of 0.20 to 0.40 m. It is proposed that aeration is essential \n\nto incorporate oxygen for aerobic decomposition and to provide a fresh surface without \n\naccumulated manure for cows to lie down on after returning from the milking parlor or \n\nfeeding. Some producers are aerating the pack deeper using a chisel plow with 0.40 to 0.45 \n\nm deep, and have observed a reduction in bedding needs and increased pack temperatures \n\n(Janni et al., 2007). Manure handling on a daily basis takes about the same time or less as \n\nmaintaining a freestall barn. \n\nFresh bedding is added when there is moisture build up in the bedding and the cows \n\nbecome dirty. Typically this occurs every few weeks. The CBP barn may have increased to \n\na depth of 1.0 to 1.2 m when removed after one year. \n\n \n2.2.3. Composting process in bedded pack \n\nComposting is the biological decomposition process that occurs under controlled \n\naerobic conditions where microorganisms reduces heterogeneous organic matter into more \n\nstable chemical compounds with the release of heat, water vapour, and carbon dioxide. The \n\ndescription of the microorganisms participating in the composting process is complex, \n\nbecause the populations and communities change continuously as a function of the \n\nevolution of temperature, nutrient availability, oxygen concentration, water content and pH \n\nin the course of composting. The composting processes occur in nature, but systems can be \n\ndesigned and managed to enhance and accelerate the process. The by-product of \n\ncomposting consists of the biomass of dead and living microorganisms, and undegradable \n\nraw material besides stable by-products of decomposition (NRCS, 2010). \n\nCompost, in turn, is the nutrient amendment produced by an aerobic composting \n\nprocess as it is viewed in a compost bedded pack which is sufficiently stabilized to \n\nminimize or eliminate unpleasant odors, substantially reduce viable pathogens, facilitate \n\nstorage, and handling without attracting insects and vectors. However, its complete \n\nstabilization is not considered practical or desirable because it would consume all the \n\nslowly degradable organic matter. The degree of stabilization and pathogen destruction \n\n\n\n16\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ndesired in compost depends on the purpose for composting and intended use of the compost \n\nby-product with a low risk of pathogen contamination. Compost is more stable (less \n\nmicrobially degradable), lighter, smaller in volume than raw manure. The finished product \n\nwill need to meet the customer\u2019s or operator\u2019s needs (Goyal et al., 2005; Gajalakshmi and \n\nAbbasi, 2008). \n\nIn addition to the presence of the needed microorganisms, major factors as nutrients, \n\ncarbon to nitrogen ratio, moisture content, temperature, and aeration are important factors \n\nto a successful composting process. Characteristics as appearance, texture, and even \n\nmaturity may not be an issue if the compost from a bedded pack is used for land \n\napplication on the farm.   \n\nIn a CBP barn, the bed depth from surface that is tilled is called an oxic zone and acts \n\nlike a frequently turned aerobic compost windrow with temperatures rising to the range of \n\n45 to 60\u00b0C when good composting conditions occur. The bottom of the CBP is called an \n\nanoxic zone and is under an anaerobic decomposition process with little oxygen available. \n\nNo agitation occurs and it becomes compacted with the added overburden of compost, by \n\ncows and tractor wheels. As would be typical for compacted manure piles, temperature \n\nrises above ambient, but it is only in the 25 to 40\u00b0C range. Figure 2.3 illustrates a CBP \n\nzones with possible gas pathways and temperature profile. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 - Scheme of CBP zones with possible gas pathways and temperature profile.  \n\n \nAs previously mentioned, composting is an aerobic process, meaning it requires large \n\namounts of oxygen for the microorganisms to grow. It can be supplied to the compost bed \n\nby diffusion, wind, natural convection or forced aeration. A minimum oxygen \n\nconcentration of 5% within the pore spaces of the compost is necessary for composting \n\n\n\n17\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\noccurs. If the supply of oxygen is limited, the composting process slows and may turn \n\nanaerobic, which is a much slower and odorous process with the potential for large N \n\nnutrient losses through denirification. During the initial stages of this aerobic process, \n\noxygen and the easily degradable nutritional components of the raw materials are rapidly \n\nconsumed by the microorganisms (NRCS, 2010). \n\nCarbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and potassium (K) are the essential and \n\nprimary nutrients required by the microorganisms involved in composting. Microorganisms \n\nuse carbon for both energy and growth, while nitrogen is essential for protein production \n\nand reproduction. Thus, an appropriate ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C:N ratio) usually \n\nensures that the others required nutrients for their survival are present in adequate amounts. \n\nIn this process, the temperature is directly related to the microorganism activity of \n\ncomposting and is a good indicator of how the process is going inside the bed (Goyal et al., \n\n2005; Gajalakshmi and Abbasi, 2008). \n\nComposting process becomes inhibited when the moisture content is below 40%. Water \n\ndisplaces much of the air in the pore spaces of the composting materials when the moisture \n\ncontent is above 65%. This limits air movement and leads to anaerobic conditions. Once \n\nmoisture, is over 65%, the rate of decomposition in the anaerobic zone is likely not to be \n\nhigh enough to generate mature compost because it is too wet to support rapid bacterial \n\nactivity. Some activity certainly does occurs, however, the material is not uniformly heated \n\nto the extent necessary to be sold commercially as compost and it would not meet USDA \n\nOrganic Certification requirements for pathogen reduction. In addition, the volume of the \n\npack does not increase much during the summer months, as it does in winter, indicating \n\nthat composting is reducing the volume of the bedded pack. If the operator wants to market \n\nthe material as compost after removing it from the barn, it will require further processing \n\n(NRCS, 2010).  \n\nOxic zone can be modeled as a semi-continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) with \n\nmoisture and fresh organic matter (manure and urine) added by the confined cows and \n\nintermittently stirred with gases continuously exchanged between atmosphere and CBP \n\nbarn. As the depth of the bed deepens with organic matter, solid material is exiting the base \n\nof the oxic zone since tillage or mixing is only in the top 0.20 to 0.40 m. Anoxic layer can \n\nbe modeled as a batch reactor with organic matter decomposition occurring producing \n\ngases that move up to the oxic layer. A transition oxic/anoxic zone lies between these \n\n\n\n18\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nlayers where the oxygen in the gas phase decreases with depth from the bottom of the oxic \n\nlayer to zero concentration at the anoxic layer. The material in this zone could be mixed \n\nduring tillage (Goyal et al., 2005; Gajalakshmi and Abbasi, 2008). \n\n \n2.2.3.1. Microbiological processes in composting bedded pack \n\nIn a model system, aeration decreases as depth of CBP bed increases in depth and \n\ncauses an oxygen concentration gradient between aerobic surface and anaerobic subsurface \n\nenvironments. The CBP system represents a dynamic environment in which spatial \n\ndistribution of microbes and microbial metabolic processes develops. The composting \n\nprocess results from the breakdown and stabilization of organic matter, with CO2 evolution \n\nand H2O evaporation. It is impacted by relatively simple management practices such as \n\nbarn ventilation and circulation and mechanical mixing of the bed. \n\nManure deposition provides a steady input of unstable C, organic N (protein and urea), \n\nand liquid fraction of the animal waste, which starts a cyclical series of microbial \n\ntransformations over time transforming a fraction of this organic matter into inorganic C or \n\nN (Warner, 1942; Kristensen, 2000; Karthikeyan and Bhandari, 2001; Beffa, 2002; \n\nMegonigal, 2004; Peigne and Girardin, 2004; Goyal, et al., 2005). Figure 2.4 shows a \n\nspatial distribution of various microbiological processes in composting bedding. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4 - Spatial distribution of various processes in composting bedding that lead to \ntrace gas formation. \n\n\n\n19\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\na) Oxic zone:  \n\nGaseous emissions from the oxic zone during aerobic composting would contain \n\nemissions of ammonia (NH3) and moisture and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs): carbon \n\ndioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). In aerobic respiration, bacteria and \n\nfungi use molecular oxygen (O2) to liberate the bulk of the energy (?H) from the organic \n\nmatter that is being decomposed, producing carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) into the \n\nCBP oxic zone.  \n\nCxHyOz\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0O2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CO2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0H2O\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0?H\u00a0\n \nThis is the principle fate of mineralized or oxidized organic carbon, occurring first by \n\noxygen (O2). This process generates more energy, increasing the temperature of the tilled \n\ntop zone, and consequently inactivates the disease organisms and increases the evaporation \n\nof moisture (Warner, 1942; Kristensen, 2000; Karthikeyan and Bhandari, 2001; Beffa, \n\n2002; Megonigal, 2004; Peigne and Girardin, 2004; Goyal, et al., 2005). \n\nIn the manure substrate, nitrogen (N) is present in organic matter as protein or in urine \n\nin the form of urea (CO(NH2)2). Aerobically, CO(NH2)2 undergoes hydrolysis and it is \n\nrapidly decomposed  to NH4\n+ \n\n and CO2 by the intracellular and extracellular urease enzyme \n\nproduced by bacteria present in both feces and soil. NH4\n+ \n\n and CO2 is also produced from \n\nthe hydrolysis of protein in the organic matter. This process is known as ammonification. \n\nControlled by thermodynamic equilibrium, the NH4\n+ form is in equilibrium with NH3. This \n\nequilibrium is pH and temperature dependent. Due to concentration gradients, a fraction of \n\nNH4\n+/NH3 is diffuse in the air-water interface of the manure, and it is partially emitted into \n\nthe air. However, the dominant part of NH4\n+/NH3 is either assimilated into microbial matter \n\nor nitrified to NO3\n-. \n\n  \nOrganic-N\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NH3 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NO2\n\n- (+NO, N2O)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0?\u00a0\u00a0  NO3\n-\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0??\n      NH4\n\n+ \n\n \nAt the first stage of nitrification, the NH4\n\n+/NH3 fraction is oxidized to NO2\n-. In the \n\nsecond stage, NO2\n- is further oxidized to NO3\n\n-. NO3\n- can subsequently be converted into \n\nnitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) and dinitrogen (N2) through denitrification \n\n(Blackburn, 1988; Robertson et al., 1989; Davidson, 1991; Henry et al., 1999; Maier et al., \n\n2000; Beffa, 2002; Senga, 2002; Megonigal, 2004). The process by which NO3\n- is reduced \n\n\n\n20\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nto nitrogen gases (N2 or N2O) is normally anaerobic but it can also occur in aerobic \n\nconditions where anaerobic microzones exist, such as internal spaces of porous organic \n\nparticles. \n\n \nb) Anoxic Zone: \n\nThe amount of denitrification depends on the availability of NO3\n-, on moisture \n\nsaturation, on temperature, and on availability of easily decomposable organic matter. \n\nThus, if the bed becomes depleted of O2, some microorganisms can use the oxygen in NO3\n- \n\nas an alternative. During this process, NO3\n- is used as electron acceptor by fermentative \n\nmicroorganisms able to grow without free oxygen. The metabolic processes occurring \n\nwhile NO3\n- is used as electron acceptor to form N2O and N2 are equal to those occurring \n\nwith the presence of O2. In addition to N2 formation, N2O, NO and NO2 may be produced \n\nunder not completely anaerobic conditions. \n\nThe lower CBP anoxic layer also shows typical anaerobic gaseous emissions as \n\nmethane (CH4), CO2, and other major gaseous emissions such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) \n\nand NH3, that moves upward or are absorbed in the oxic zone. Anaerobically, \n\ncarbohydrates and organic acids originating from protein degradation are converted by \n\nmixed heterotrophic and fermentative bacteria and fungi to acetate (CH3COO\n-/CH3COOH) \n\nand CO2, which in turn are transformed into CH4 by two different microbial pathways in a \n\nprocess called methanogenesis.  \n\nCO2 \u00a0\u00a0+\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0H2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CH4\u00a0\n\nCH3COOH \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CH4 \u00a0\u00a0+\u00a0\u00a0CO2 \n\n\u00a0\n\nMethanogenesis represents a significant portion of the carbon gas flow in the anaerobic \n\nzone. CH4 diffusing upward reaches the anoxic/oxic zone and it is consumed by oxidizing \n\nbacteria in a process known as methanotrophy (Megonigal, 2004). Thus, CH4 is oxidized in \n\nthe presence of O2 so that it diffuses upwards to the oxic zone.  \n\n \nCH4 \u00a0+\u00a0\u00a0O2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0H2O \u00a0\u00a0+\u00a0\u00a0CO2\u00a0\n\n \nThe same microorganisms that oxidize NH3 can oxidize CH4. This implies that CH4 \n\ncould inhibit NH3 oxidation and NH3 could inhibit CH4 oxidation, depending on the \n\nconcentrations. Acidity of the CBP can affect this balance (Maier et al., 2000). \n\n\n\n21\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nc) Oxic/Anoxic Zone: \n\nThe oxic/anoxic interface of these two layers becomes a zone where organisms can \n\npotentially produce or decompose similar emission gases. Denitrifiers convert NO3\n- to \n\ngaseous end products (NO, N2O, N2). The final gaseous phase products depend on \n\navailable C and O2 supply. Oxygen level is reduced by microbial oxidation of available \n\norganic C, which affects the reductive steps controlled by distinct enzymes affected.  \n\n \nNO3\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NO2\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0?\u00a0NO \u00a0\u00a0?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0N2O \u00a0?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0N2 \n\n \n\nN2O is formed as an intermediate and it is available for release to the atmosphere \n\nthrough diffusion or during tillage (Warner, 1942; Kristensen, 2000; Karthikeyan and \n\nBhandari, 2001; Beffa, 2002; Megonigal, 2004; Peigne and Girardin, 2004; Goyal et al., \n\n2005; Coyne, 2008). Within the oxic/anoxic environment, an alternative route for the \n\nconversion and removal of NH3 is possible for which substantially less information is \n\nknown - anaerobic oxidation of NH3 (ANAMOX). \n\n \nNH3  \u00a0\u00a0?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NO2\n\n-\u00a0\n\nNH3\u00a0\u00a0+\u00a0\u00a0NO2\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0N2\u00a0\n\n \nThis process has been found at the oxic/anoxic interface, both in an aquatic \n\nmicroenvironment (Warner, 1942; Kristensen, 2000; Karthikeyan and Bhandari, 2001; \n\nBeffa, 2002; Megonigal, 2004; Peigne, and Girardin, 2004; Goyal, et al., 2005) and in \n\nwastewater treatment (Maier et al., 2000). In natural oxic/anoxic interface of aquatic \n\nsediment microenvironments where CH4, NO2\n- and NO3\n\n- are present, the following \n\nanaerobic methane oxidations are found (Raghoebarsing et al., 2006).  \n\n \nCH4 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NO3\n\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 N2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0H2O\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+\u00a0\u00a0CO2\u00a0\n\nCH4 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NO2\n-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0N2 \u00a0\u00a0+\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0H2O\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+\u00a0\u00a0CO2\u00a0\n\n \nd) Entire Bed: \n\n There are implications that gases, such as H2S, CO2, and CH4 that are formed in the \n\nanoxic zone and move upward through the CBP zones, can affect the microbial processes \n\nshown above. H2S emission can block the enzymes of microorganisms that oxidize NH3 to \n\nNO2\n- at the oxic zone and the enzyme that reduces N2O to N2 at the oxic/anoxic interface of \n\n\n\n22\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nboth zone (Joye and Hollibaugh, 1995; Kristensen, 2000; Karthikeyan and Bhandari, 2001; \n\nBeffa, 2002; Megonigal, 2004; Peigne and Girardin, 2004; Goyal, et al., 2005).  \n\nThe enzymatic system for anaerobic NH3 oxidation can also be blocked by H2S effect. \n\nBecause of these blockages, the N2O concentration at the oxic/anoxic interface rises if the \n\norganisms producing the needed enzyme for its production are present. The NH3 \n\nconcentration also rise. The CH4 produced in the anoxic zone it infiltrates the oxic zone and \n\ncompete for the enzyme that oxidizes NH3. It is because the same microorganisms that \n\noxidize NH3 can oxidize CH4 (Peigne and Girardin, 2004; Goyal et al., 2005).  \n\nFactors, such as, aeration, moisture, mixing, and substrate supply alter the dynamic \n\nequilibrium that exists between all these processes. Aeration can increase methanotrophy \n\nand nitrification process. Poor ventilation or moisture saturation can enhance the capacity \n\nfor menthanogenesis and denitrification. GHG evolution depends in large part on how the \n\nsystems are managed to generate the starting substrates, the rates of the microbial \n\nprocesses, and the subsequent transfer of by-products formed between aerobic and \n\nanaerobic zones (Warner, 1942; Kristensen, 2000; Karthikeyan and Bhandari, 2001; Beffa, \n\n2002; Megonigal, 2004; Peigne and Girardin, 2004; Goyal et al., 2005). \n\nWithin the oxic layer, it is still possible to have the formation of anoxic zones where \n\ndense clumps exist (Bewley and Taraba, 2009) and the air diffusion is restricted. The \n\ntillage sweeps do not produce homogenous aggregates which leads to a second mode by \n\nwhich aerobic and anaerobic microbial processes can produce GHGs. Spatial distribution \n\nof aerobic and anaerobic zones is not simply by depth, but also by location within large \n\naggregates that are created in the CBP. \n\n\u00a0\n\n2.2.4. Composting and moisture \n\nComposting requires sufficient moisture for active microbial activity but not so much \n\nmoisture to hinder aeration. Moisture levels between 50% and 60% are generally \n\nrecommended for the most of composting materials. Urine, wet manure, and moisture from \n\nmicrobial activity are the moisture sources in a composting bedded-pack. When moisture is \n\ntoo low, the microbes won\u2019t have enough water, and the compost will be too cool, resulting \n\nin a compost rate that it is too slow. If the moisture level is too high, the pack becomes \n\nanaerobic (lacking in oxygen). In another words, the rate of microbial decomposition will \n\nbe slow and again, composting and heat generation will also be too slow (Bewley and \n\nTaraba, 2009). \n\n\n\n23\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nBy stirring the pack, both moisture and manure can be mixed into the composting \n\nbedded-pack and will aerate the tilled layer. Good ventilation helps dry the freshly turned \n\nbedded-pack surface to retard bacterial growth on the surface and keep cows cleaner since \n\ndry bedding does not stick to the teat or leg surfaces. Compost barn owners from \n\nMinnesota recommend adding fresh bedding when the bedded pack becomes moist enough \n\nto stick to cows (Janni et al., 2005). \n\nA wet bedded pack is more vulnerable to compaction. The compaction may be caused \n\nby the machinery that is used for stirring. Lower ground pressure tillage machinery should \n\nhelp reduce media compaction. Compaction in turn reduces air flow and oxygen in the \n\nbedded pack and thereby the pack can become anaerobic more rapidly. An anaerobic pack \n\nshows lower temperatures which leads to reduced pathogen kill, and more pest and odor \n\nproblems (Janni et al., 2005; Graves, 1999). \n\n  \n2.2.5. Manure and effluent management \n\nManagement of animal manure and effluent is an integral part of a total dairy producer \n\nmanagement plan. Changes in agricultural production have led to fewer producers, larger \n\naverage herd sizes, purchase of feed from distant areas, and a much higher concentration of \n\nanimals and production facilities on less land. In some areas livestock operations have \n\nbecome concentrated, and non-farm residents have located amongst the farms. These \n\nfeatures increase the challenge for implementing good manure management plans (MWPS-\n\n7, 2000). \n\nA manure management system includes: collection, transfer, storage, possible \n\ntreatment, land application, nutrient utilization, and sampling. \n\nIntensive, more specialized, concentrated animal production systems have altered the \n\nnutrient cycle and balance between crop production and animal production. Independent of \n\noperation size, a proper manure management system and plan are essential. A complete \n\nmanure management system has the following goals: a) maintain good animal health and \n\nmilk quality by providing sanitary facilities; b) avoid pollution of soil, groundwater or \n\nsurface water; c) reduce odors and dust; d) control insect and other pest reproduction; e) \n\nand others (SWIM, 2011). \n\nFailure to provide adequate manure collection, handling, and storage facilities in \n\nconjunction with adequate land area for proper application and utilization of manure \n\nnutrients could adversely affect air, water, and land resources. \n\n\n\n24\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nCBP barns owners have some strategies for managing the effluent and manure. Some \n\nproducers have added a little of the composted pack to the feed alley to absorb moisture \n\n(Barberg et al., 2007). The concrete feed alley is scraped at least twice a day. The collected \n\nmanure and bedding is stored in an approved manure storage unit until land applied \n\naccording to a manure management plan.  \n\nBedded packs should be completely cleaned out each fall and applied to cropland as \n\npart of a manure management plan (Gay, 2009). CBP barns owners in Minnesota have been \n\nremoving a portion of the pack for land application in Spring, and doing a complete \n\ncleanout in the Fall. While this works well for manure management, it presents concerns \n\nfor nutrient management, since manure applied in Fall may lose nitrogen over the winter. \n\nThe rationale for Fall cleanout is that the CBP barns owners want maximum manure \n\nstorage over the winter (Barberg et al., 2007). When the material is removed from the barn, \n\nit can either be land spread as is, or composted further to produce a product suitable for \n\nhorticulture, organic agriculture, and home gardens. As it comes out of the barn, the bedded \n\npack material has a high C:N ratio, is high in soluble salts, and has pathogens in it, but it \n\nworks well for meeting the nutrient requirements of field crops (Petzen et al., 2009). \n\nCompost used as a soil conditioner has the potential to result in higher crop yields and \n\nreduced erosion (NRAES-54, 1992). \n\nCare must be taken to avoid disturbing the clay base during clean out and pack stirring \n\nwhen the bedded pack is less than 0.30 m deep. Some users recommend starting with 0.45 \n\nto 0.60 m of sawdust to avoid problems. The composting bedded pack is typically cleaned \n\nout and land applied in the fall after corn silage is harvested. Fall clean out allows time for \n\na new pack to accumulate and begin composting before cold weather sets in. Some \n\noperators remove some of the bedded pack in the spring before fields are planted to make \n\nsure there is sufficient space for pack accumulation during the summer when cropland is \n\nnot available for manure application. However, if a compost bed is active, particularly \n\nduring the non-winter months, bed depth is reduced by microbial activity, but it can also \n\noccur due to less bedding used. Going into winter, there may not be a great depth and \n\ntherefore adequate storage is present to get through winter. CBP barns require equipment to \n\nhandle manure as both a solid (the pack) and a slurry (the feed alley manure). This \n\nincreases a producer's investment in equipment (Janni et al., 2007). \n\n \n\n\n\n25\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n2.3. Physical properties of the bedding material \n\nThe physical properties of compost bedding materials play an important role in every \n\nstage of compost production as well as in the handling and utilization of the end product. \n\nFrom the mixing of various feedstock and process monitoring and maintenance, to the \n\npackaging and shipping of the final product, parameters such as porosity, bulk density, \n\nparticle density, moisture content, water holding capacity and particle size affect the \n\noptimum composting environment and the design of machinery used in the system to \n\npromote the aeration of the compost bedding material. \n\nAlthough compost can vary and must be carefully tested to determine their exact \n\nnature, numerous laboratory trials with different products have successfully quantified the \n\nbeneficial effects (CUC, 2003). \n\n \n2.3.1. Porosity \n\nTransport of mass and heat in a compost layers is significantly affected by the geometry \n\nand size distribution of the pores and the composition of the composting material. \n\nTherefore it is at least necessary to have information about the spatial distribution of \n\nporosity. Porosity can be calculated from dry matter content, true density of dry matter and \n\ntotal bulk density. Dry matter content and true density of dry matter are easily measured in \n\nthe laboratory (Ginkel et al., 1999).  \n\nPorosity is the ratio of the pore space to the total volume occupied by the material and \n\nthe ideal bed porosity is one that provides the greatest surface area for microbial activity \n\nand the least resistance to airflow through the compost layer. It is determined by the \n\nparticle size, the size gradation of the materials, and the continuity of the air spaces. Larger \n\nparticles and more uniform particles increase porosity (NRAES-54, 1992). \n\nPorosity greater than 50% causes the compost layer to remain at a low temperature \n\nbecause energy loss exceeds heat produced. Too little porosity leads to anaerobic \n\nconditions and odour generation from too little oxygen occupying the reduced void space. \n\nThe percentage air-filled pore space of composting layer should be in the range of 35% to \n\n50% (Bernal et al., 2009). \n\n \n2.3.2. Bulk density \n\nThe bulk density of compost is a measure of the mass of material within a given \n\nvolume and it is important in the determination of initial compost mixtures. The bulk \n\n\n\n26\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ndensity determines how much material can be placed at a certain site (Agnew et al., 2003). \n\nThe density of compost also influences the mechanical properties such as strength, \n\nporosity, and ease of compaction (Agnew and Leonard, 2003). Therefore, knowing the bulk \n\ndensity of the material throughout the compost layer is important for aeration, handling, \n\nand storage requirements. \n\nHowever, distinction is made between time dependent and independent processes to \n\ndescribe bulk density distribution. The time independent process results from the \n\ncompressibility of composting material. Compressibility is defined as the reciprocal of the \n\nresistance of the material against mechanical deformation, or more precisely, as the ratio \n\nbetween deformation and stress. Due to this property the bulk density is a function of the \n\nlocal pressure and therefore depends on the position within in the compost bed (Ginkel et \n\nal., 1999). \n\nThe time dependent process is defined as the increase of mechanical deformation as a \n\nfunction of time under constant pressure conditions (Ginkel et al., 1999). When a \n\ncomposting material is spread over the pack area, the initial bulk density distribution is \n\nonly determined by the compressibility of the composting material. However, during the \n\nprocess, bulk density and porosity are also influenced by the combined effects of \n\nsubsidence, loss of organic matter due to biological degradation processes and change of \n\nwater content due to transport processes. \n\nThe effect of compaction pressure on bulk density is also studied. It is observed that the \n\neffect of compaction pressure on bulk density for larger particles is higher in comparison \n\nwith smaller particles, because smaller particles are closely packed leaving less space \n\namong the particles (Mozammel et al., 2006). \n\nParameters that influence the bedding material performance are moisture content, bulk \n\ndensity and porosity (Wright and Inglis, 2002). This is relative to green materials that are \n\nhigh in water, which would not be suitable for bedding. Dried straw wood and other \n\nforages would be needed. Thus, increasing bulk density, moisture content and depth of the \n\npack can result in decreased permeability, especially for oxygen. If the moisture content in \n\nthe pack increases, particles get wet resulting in reduced strength of the media (Ahn et al., \n\n2009). This can cause anaerobic condition in the pack which leads to odor, low \n\ntemperatures and emission of nitrogen compounds as well as methane. Materials that \n\nabsorb too much water or urine are not suitable such as bedding material as this high \n\n\n\n27\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nmoisture content can rupture the cell walls which results in additional free water. In \n\naddition wet bedding also contributes to dirtier cows. \n\nSoybean straw and chipped pallet material worked well in combination with sawdust in \n\nthe compost bedded pack system. Both materials provided the absorbency and bulk density \n\nnecessary to meet cow comfort and the porosity required to promote an aerobic compost \n\nprocess (Petzen et al., 2009). \n\n \n\n2.3.3. Particle density \n\nThe accurate quantification of particle density, as a component of bulk density, is \n\nvitally important for gravimetric compost measurements. For other media such as soil, \n\nparticle density is often assumed to be 2.65 g cm-3, the density of quartz (Brady and Weil, \n\n2002). However, compost particle density is more inconsistent due to variation in source \n\nmaterials. \n\nConcisely stated, the method employs the submersion of a known mass of compost in \n\nmethanol to determine the volume of the compost solids. While methanol is used because \n\nof its low density (0.66 g cm-3), the premise of the method remains valid for many other \n\nlow density liquids. The use of a low density liquid causes particles that are normally \n\nbuoyant in water to sink, facilitating an accurate measurement of the compost solids \n\nvolume (Weindorf and Wittie, 2003). \n\n \n\n2.3.4. Moisture content \n\nIt is the fraction or percentage of a substance comprised of water. The moisture content \n\non a dry basis is the wet weight minus dry weight divided by the dry weight minus the \n\ncontainer weight. To obtain the moisture content in percent, multiply this ratio by 100 \n\n(Mukhtar et al., 2004). The general procedure involves weighing the wet sample and then \n\ndrying the sample for 24 hours at temperatures of 105\u00b0C. The moisture content on a wet \n\nbasis can be calculate using equation 2.1. \n\n \nWet weight - Dry weight\n\nMoisture  content (%) = 100\nWet weight - Container weight\n\n?  (2.1) \n\n \nMethods for determining moisture content on the farm differ in the way that the sample \n\nis dried. Three common methods include air drying, conventional oven drying and \n\n\n\n28\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nmicrowave oven drying. Although the results produced by these methods are less accurate \n\nthan laboratory procedures, they are satisfactory for almost all composting situations \n\n(NRAES-54, 1992). \n\nThe moisture content of compost affects the bulk density. Moisture content is also \n\nrelevant because it affects compost handling. Compost which is dry can be dusty and \n\nirritating to the cows and workers, while compost which is wet can become heavy, making \n\nits application more difficult and transport more expensive. \n\nThe ideal moisture content for composting must therefore be a compromise between \n\nachieving adequate moisture for the microorganisms to survive and adequate oxygen flow \n\nto maintain aerobic conditions. The moisture content for composting is generally \n\nrecommended to be in the range of 40 to 60% (Shane et al., 2010; NRAES-54, 1992), and \n\ncan be tested accurately using analytical equipment or approximated using a hand-squeeze \n\nmethod. In the hand-squeeze method, a handful of compost material is squeezed firmly \n\nseveral times to form a ball. If the ball crumbles or breaks into fragments, the moisture \n\ncontent is much less than 40%. If it remains intact after being gently bounced 3-4 times, the \n\nmoisture content is nearly 50%. If the ball texture is slimy water droplets drip from or \n\nappear on the surface of squeezed bedding, the pack is too wet, the moisture content is \n\nmuch higher than 60% (Mukhtar et al., 2004). When the pack is working well, the bedding \n\nmaterial will appear loose and fluffy, not compacted and chunky (Bewley and Taraba, \n\n2009). Pack moisture content in the top layer should ideally be monitored weekly to decide \n\nwhen clean bedding needs to be added to the pack (Shane et al., 2010) as opposed to when \n\nthe cows are dirty. \n\n \n\n2.3.5. Water Holding Capacity \n\nWater holding capacity (WHC) is the ability of a given volume of compost to hold \n\nwater under one atmosphere of pressure. In another words, WHC is the ability of compost \n\nto retain moisture against drainage due to gravity. Moisture (manure and urine) is held in \n\nthe spaces, or pores, between compost material particles and thin films around these \n\nparticles. Organic matter and particle size affect the compost ability to retain moisture. \n\nWHC is measured as a percent of dry weight. \n\nThe WHC provides information on the amount of water that can be absorbed by the \n\nbedding material. High WHC allows the media to absorb water into the bedding. However, \n\n\n\n29\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ndepending on the cell structure of the media, high water content in the cell can sometimes \n\nlead to rupture of the cell which results in the media releasing free water (Vokey, 2008). \n\nThis limits the media\u2019s ability to function as a bedding material for longer periods of time. \n\nSome research have observed that WHC increased with decrease in the particle size of the \n\ncompost media (Changirath et al., 2011). For this reason, one of the functions of the \n\nbedding material in the CBP barns is to retain moisture. Therefore, if the compost material \n\nhas a high WHC, the ability of dairy producer to dry in the pack can be lower. \n\n \n\n2.3.6. Particle size \n\nParticle size and distribution are critical for balancing the surface area for growth of \n\nmicroorganisms and the maintenance of adequate porosity for aeration. The larger the \n\nparticle size, the lower the surface area to mass ratio. So, compost with large particles does \n\nnot decompose adequately because the interior of the particles has difficult accessibility for \n\noxygen for aerobic microorganisms (Bernal et al., 1993). However, particles which are too \n\nsmall can compact the mass, reducing the porosity and airflow within the compost layer \n\nwill be restricted. A mix of particle sizes creates the most porous layer, see Figure 2.5. \n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5 - Porosity affecting the aeration: (a) Loosely packed - well structured, (b) \nLoosely packed - uniform particle size, (c) Tightly packed - uniform particle \nsize, and (d) Tightly packed - mixed particle sizes. (CUC, 2003). \n\n \nMedia particle size distribution is an important factor influencing the bedding moisture \n\ncontent, compaction and bulk density. Sawdust serves as a good carbon source and when \n\nfine materials like sawdust are used as a bedding media. They need to be turned frequently \n\nin the pack. It has also been suggested that the amount of fine particles in the bedding has \n\n\n\n30\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nan effect on the bacterial population on the teat ends. Factors such as particle size may be \n\nmore important than simply bacterial counts in the used bedding (CWMI, 2006). The finer \n\nthe media, the more time is required to clean the udder before milking. \n\nMicrobial activity generally occurs on the surface of the organic particles. Therefore, \n\ndecreasing particle size, through its effect of increasing surface area, will encourage \n\nmicrobial activity and increase the rate of decomposition. On the other hand, when \n\nparticles are too small and compact, air circulation through the compost layer is inhibited. \n\nThis decreases O2 available to microorganisms within the compost and ultimately \n\ndecreases the rate of microbial activity (NRAES-54, 1992). \n\nParticle size also affects the availability of carbon and nitrogen. Large wood chips in \n\nbedding, for example, provide a good bulking agent that helps to ensure aeration through \n\nthe compost layer, but they provide less available carbon per mass than they would have in \n\nthe form of wood shavings or sawdust. \n\nHandreck (1983) studied the particle size and physical properties of compost media and \n\nconcluded that the fraction smaller than 0.5 mm, and in particular between 0.1 and 0.25 \n\nmm, has the highest influence on porosity and water retention. \n\n \n\n2.4. Thermal property of the bedding material \n\nCompost thermal properties are required in many areas of agriculture engineering, \n\nagronomy, and animal science. In recent years, considerable effort has gone into \n\ndeveloping techniques to determine these properties (Abu-Hamdeh, 2003). \n\nThermal properties of compost bulking materials affect temperature and biodegradation \n\nduring the composting process. Well determined thermal properties of compost feedstock \n\nwill therefore contribute to practical thermodynamic approaches (Ahn et al., 2006). \n\nThermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and thermal diffusivity are the three \n\nimportant thermal properties regarding heat transfer analysis. These three thermal \n\nproperties can be measured by several methods (Ahn et al., 2009). \n\nThe thermal conductivity is the property that describes the heat transfer capacity within \n\nthe compost material. The specific heat capacity is the amount of energy required to raise \n\nthe compost material one degree Celsius. Thermal diffusivity has been used as an indicator \n\nfor the utility of compost materials as an insulator or heat conductor. In other words, \n\nthermal diffusivity is the measure of thermal inertia.  \n\n\n\n31\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nAlthough thermal properties are very important in composting, information on their \n\nvalues for various compost materials is lacking. In general, it is difficult to determine the \n\nthermal properties of moist materials because forced heating during the measurements \n\ncauses internal liquid and/or gas convection. This often results in overestimating the \n\nthermal properties. The thermal probe method is the most attractive method, because it uses \n\nrelatively simple equipment to determine the thermal properties for moist materials \n\n(Iwabuchi et al., 1999). \n\n \n\n2.4.1. Thermal conductivity \n\nThe thermal conductivity coefficient of a compound medium is often a very complex \n\nquantity. It is dependent not only on the components themselves, but also on structure, \n\ncomposition, density, porosity, water content and temperature (Van Ginkel et al., 1999). \n\nCertainly in a compost bedding layer, where all these parameters are changing during the \n\ncompost management and process, the only way to obtain reliable values is to measure this \n\nquantity. Thermal conductivity can be measured by the steady and non-steady state \n\n(transient heat dissipation) methods (Mohsenin, 1980). \n\nTransient line heat source methods have been used several years to measure thermal \n\nconductivity of porous materials, like bedding compost. Typically a probe for this \n\nmeasurement consists of a needle with a heater and temperature sensor inside. A current is \n\npassed through the heater and the temperature of the probe is monitored over time. An \n\nanalysis of the probe temperature is used to determine thermal conductivity. More recently \n\nthe heater and temperature sensor have been placed in separate needles. In the dual probe \n\nthe analysis of the temperature versus time relationship for the separated probes yields \n\ninformation on diffusivity and heat capacity as well as conductivity (Bristow et al., 1994). \n\n \n2.4.2. Specific heat capacity \n\nThe specific heat capacity can be defined as the amount of heat energy required raising \n\nthe temperature by one degree Celsius per unit mass (Incropera and DeWitt, 2001). Several \n\nresearchers studied the behavior of thermal properties with the variation of water content of \n\nvarious biological materials and observed that there is a relationship in which the increase \n\nof water content causes high values of specific heat (Ahn et al., 2009). \n\nFactors influencing specific heat capacity that can be managed externally include \n\nmoisture content and compost density. Moisture content plays a major role in specific heat \n\n\n\n32\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ncapacity but is the most difficult to manage (Abu-Hamdeh, 2003). Compost management \n\naffects specific heat capacity by the machinery that is used for stirring (Janni et al., 2005). \n\nBecause of this, the bulk density increases and the porosity of a compost bedding \n\ndecreases. This in turn have a significant effect on specific heat capacity. \n\n \n\n2.4.3. Thermal diffusivity \n\nSeveral studies have reported two of the thermal properties and obtained the thermal \n\ndiffusivity using the following relationship\u00a0 (Haug, 1980; Briaud and Chaouch, 1997; \n\nBristow, 1998; Abu-Hamdeh, 2001): \n\n \n\np\n\nk\n? = \n\n? C?\n (2.2) \n\n \nwhere: ? is the thermal diffusivity (m2/s), k is the thermal conductivity (W/m \u00b0C), ? is the \n\nbulk density (kg m-3) and CP is the specific heat capacity (J/kg \u00b0C). \n\n \n\nThermal diffusivity, like thermal conductivity, is a property of the substance. The term \n\nk \u00b7 ?-1 \u00b7 Cp\n-1\n\n appears in many heat conduction problems and is related to the diffusion \n\ncoefficient used in mass transfer analysis or modeling. \n\n \n\n2.5. Chemical properties of bedding material \n\nSince a variety of organic materials can be used to make bedding composts (i.e., rice \n\nhusks, coffee husks, bagasse, paper, peanut shell), it becomes very important to know their \n\nchemical characteristics, in order to obtain the required chemical characteristics for growth \n\nmedia (Zoes et al., 2001).  \n\nCarbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) are the primary nutrients \n\nrequired by the microorganisms involved in composting. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and \n\npotassium are also the primary nutrients for plants; so their concentrations also influence \n\nthe value of the compost. \n\nMany organic materials, including manures and organic materials, contain ample \n\nquantities of nutrients (Table 2.2). Composts that are derived primarily from wood by-\n\nproducts have high carbon to nitrogen ratios unless additional nitrogen is added during the \n\ncomposting process. Excessive or insufficient carbon or nitrogen is most likely to affect the \n\n\n\n33\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ncomposting process. Microorganisms use carbon for both energy and growth while \n\nnitrogen is essential for essential protein production to the metabolism and reproduction. In \n\ngeneral, biological organisms need about 25 times more carbon than nitrogen (NRAES-54, \n\n1992). Therefore, it is important to provide carbon and nitrogen in appropriate proportions. \n\nThe ratio of carbon to nitrogen is referred to as the C:N ratio. \n\n \nTable 2.2 - Common feedstock and their characteristics \n\nFeedstock Moisture content (%) C:N Bulk density \nHigh in Carbon    \nHay 8 - 10 15 - 30 - \nCorn stalks 12 60 - 70 32 \nStraw 5 - 20 40 - 150 50 - 400 \nSawdust 20 - 60 200 - 700 350 - 450 \nWood chips - 100 - 500 - \nHigh in Nitrogen    \nDairy manure 80 5 - 25 1400 \nGrass clippings - 15 - 25  \n\nSource: Adapted from NRAES-54 (1992). \n\n \nA balanced C:N ratio usually ensures that the other required nutrients are present in \n\nadequate amounts. To calculate the carbon content given C:N and percent nitrogen, solve: \n\n \nC(%) = N(%) \u00b7 C:N  (2.3) \n\n \nRaw materials blended to provide a C:N ratio of 25:1 to 30:1 are ideal for active \n\ncomposting, although initial C:N ratios from 20:l up to 40:1 consistently give good \n\ncomposting results. For many applications, C:N ratios of even 50:1 and higher are \n\nacceptable. With C:N ratios below 20:1 the available carbon is fully utilized without \n\nstabilizing all of the nitrogen. The excess nitrogen may then be lost to the atmosphere as \n\nammonia or nitrous oxide and odor can become a problem. Mixes of materials with C:N \n\nratios higher than 40:1 require longer composting times for the microorganisms to use the \n\nexcess carbon (NRAES-54, 1992).  \n\nCompost bedded pack manure is an excellent nutrient source to use with zone-till and \n\nno-till cropping systems. This is because more of the nitrogen is in its stable organic form, \n\ncompared to liquid or fresh (Petzen et al., 2009). \n\n \n\n\n\n34\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n2.6. Biological properties of compost bedding material \n\nOne of the aspects of composting that makes it an attractive alternative to the direct \n\napplication of untreated manure is the high degree of pathogen destruction that is possible \n\nwith a well-managed composting operation. The pathogen content of the compost is \n\nimportant because improperly treated compost can be a source of pathogens to the \n\nenvironment and, as such, a threat to humans and animals. \n\n \n2.6.1. Predominant groups \n\nPathogenic microorganisms that may be in compost include bacteria, viruses, fungi, \n\nand parasites. Although parasites and viruses cannot reproduce apart from their host, they \n\ncan often survive for extended periods. If they are not killed during the composting \n\nprocess, they can survive until the compost is land applied. At that time, they may infect a \n\nnew host (NRCS, 2010). In the compost process, these species will thrive or fail according \n\nto their abilities to find a niche in the compost ecosystem (Sales, 2008). Typical species are \n\nshown in Table 2.3. \n\n \nTable 2.3 - Some species of microorganisms found in composting. \n\nActinomycetes Algae \nActinoplanes sp.

Bacteria  \n\nBacteria are the smallest living organisms and the most numerous in compost. They \n\nmake up 80 to 90% of the billions of microorganisms typically found in a gram of compost. \n\nBacteria are responsible for most of the decomposition and heat generation in compost. \n\nThey are the most nutritionally diverse group of compost organisms, using a broad range of \n\nenzymes to chemically break down a variety of organic materials (CWMI, 2006). \n\nAmong the bacteria, the actinomycetes, and the bacteria (gram negative and positive) \n\nare most important in the context of composting (Table 2.4), the former as allergens and \n\nopportunistic pathogens, and the latter as indicators of an insufficient thermohygienization \n\n(fecal coliforms) and as producers of endotoxins (Beffa, 2002). \n\n \nTable 2.4 - The following groups of human and animal pathogens as having the most \n\nimportance in composting environments. \nBacteria Fungi Viruses \n\nColiform Aspergillus fumigatus Coxsackie-B-Virus \nEnterobacteraceae Penicillium Echo-Virus \nE. coli \nPseudomonas \nStaphylococci \nStreptococci \nStaphylococcal species \nStreptococcal species \n\nSource: Beffa (2002). \n\n \nBacterial growth over time can be graphed as cell number versus time. This is called a \n\ngrowth curve. The cell number is plotted as the log of the cell number, since it is an \n\nexponential function. Regardless of the generation time, in a growing culture, the plot of \n\nthe log of cell number versus time gives a characteristic curve (MBS, 1999). This curve \n\ntypically has four distinct phases: lag phase, exponential phase, stationary phase, and death \n\nphase, see Figure 2.6. \n\nMany factors affect the generation time of the organism: temperature, pH, oxygen, salt \n\nconcentration and nutrients are some of the common factors that may change in the normal \n\nenvironment of bacteria. Due to difficulties in tracking and quantifying the relationships \n\nbetween physical factors and bacterial populations, it has not been possible to fully \n\nunderstand the ecological processes important in composting. Identifying these \n\n\n\n36\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nrelationships has been complicated by the presence of an uncontrolled bacterial inoculum \n\nthat varies between operations due to variations in material handling, air conditioning, and \n\nsubstrate composition (Schloss et al., 2003). Several previous composting studies, though, \n\nhave attempted to quantify bacterial populations using different techniques (Nakasaki et al., \n\n1985; Strom, 1985). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6 - Bacterial growth curve and the four phases of growth versus time (Adapted \nfrom MBS, 1999). \n\n \n\n2.7. Mathematical modeling \n\nMathematical modeling is a method of research that investigates, through \n\nmathematical problems, phenomena or situations from different areas such as physics, \n\nchemistry, biology, engineering, and others, consisting in an area of research that is \n\nessentially interdisciplinary, to make predictions about the situation or problem \n\ninvestigated. This set of relations is called a mathematical model of the problem studied. \n\nThe dynamic process used to create and validate such models is called mathematical \n\nmodeling (Bassanezzi, 2002). \n\nMathematical modeling has a role to evaluate the interaction between several factors \n\nallowing a more detailed study in order to predict the processes of interest, and the ideal is \n\nto formulate a model capable of describing the original study, without the difficulties \n\nencountered in observations and measurements made during examination of the problem. \n\nMoreover, the mathematical model is a simplification of the system being studied, and \n\ncannot predict all the variables present. The resulting prediction may not be accurate or \n\nreliable. When using f mathematical models, it is necessary to determine the parameters \n\n\n\n37\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nthrough empirical experimentation implying the need for several samples (Pereira and \n\nMachado, 1987). \n\nOver many years agricultural buildings, such as dairy barns, have become tailored for \n\nspecialized production The need to maintain control over the indoor climate has become \n\never more important so that the requirements of the production system can be continuously \n\nmet. In essence it is necessary to understand the interaction of all climatic variables, \n\nalongside their contribution to the occupants heat exchange with its surroundings in order \n\nto predict the micro-climate (Norton et al., 2007). \n\nTherefore, the thermal environment of a agricultural building is intricately linked with \n\nambient conditions. Optimizing and controlling ventilation systems are not elementary \n\nproblems and may require extensive experimentation (Boulard et al., 2002a; Zhang et al., \n\n2000). Sophisticated techniques that allow efficient and accurate description of the \n\ndominant phenomena are often required. The mathematical modeling of the interaction \n\nbetween the indoor production system, the ventilation system and the outdoor environment \n\nis thus a necessary requirement. The clear advantages of developing mathematical models \n\nfor agricultural buildings are as follows (Schauberger et al., 2000): \n\na) They can quantify the essential needs of the occupant in all parts of ventilated \n\nbuildings and consequently contribute to the development of optimization strategies aimed \n\nat increasing production performance. \n\nb) They can be incorporated as part of indoor climate control, as well as to check the \n\ndesign values of the ventilation system. \n\nc) They can combine the spatial and temporal dependent parameters that affect release \n\nof all pollutants within the building to efficiently calculate time-varying concentrations \n\nwithin, and emissions from production systems. \n\nd) They can quantify different housing systems with alternative manure management \n\ntechniques to achieve a fully integrated control of pollution. \n\n \nTherefore, agricultural production systems, which are amenable to description through \n\nthe physical laws of fluid motion, heat and mass transfer processes, can be effectively \n\nmodeled so that the benefits of pre-design evaluation, design and optimization strategies \n\ncan be realized (Norton et al., 2007). \n\nThe modeling of ventilation flow in agriculture building can be can be performed \n\nusing the Navier-Stokes equations (Norton et al., 2007). The Navier\u2013Stokes equations \n\n\n\n38\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nrepresent the dynamic behavior of a flow regime, both spatially and temporally. These \n\nequations constitute a micro-model of fluid motion, and require time consuming iterative \n\ntechniques to solve them. Thus, the efficient quantification of ventilation in agricultural \n\nbuildings can be carried with a macro-model based on Bernoulli\u2019s equation. This requires \n\nsome qualifying assumptions so that the model matches the spatial domain of interest, such \n\nas the flow is not viscous; steady, not rotational; with hydro-static and gravity as the only \n\nacting external force (Roy et al., 2002). Consequently, much information on the flow is \n\nlost, including details on the spatial distribution of the airflow patterns, which can lead to \n\ninaccuracies in the calculated airflow variables (Boulard et al., 2002b). \n\nAccording to Mueller and Krause (2007), when sizing ventilation systems there are \n\ndifferent methods which may be used to obtain an overall view of the heat transfer and \n\nmass transport phenomena inside the animal production facility, including numerical \n\nsimulation of flow, physical models and measurements on a real scale. \n\na) Numerical simulation of flow: from this simulation it is possible to study the \n\nbehavior of fluids in motion. Therefore, it has become very interesting to study these \n\nphenomena with the advance of faster computer processors and more efficient software. \n\nFluid mechanics include, for example, study of either laminar or turbulent fluid and gas \n\nflow in animal installations. This type of study may present important practical applications \n\nin the diverse areas of engineering. \n\nb) Physical models: investigations with physical models offer greater support to the \n\nnumerical simulation of mass flux. The ventilation system as well as the flux of air volume \n\nmay be altered by a simple formula, i.e., the reconstruction of entire elements may be \n\nperformed quite simply in such models. \n\nc) Another form of evaluating the dispersion behavior of gases coming from animal \n\ninstallations is by the utilization of the wind tunnel boundary limit, where in many cases \n\nthese are equipped with air velocity sensors and gas analyzers to measure the variation in \n\nconcentration. \n\nd) Real scale measurements: are necessary to confirm the numerical and physical \n\nmodels in real conditions. A specific problem is the determination of volumetric air flux in \n\nnaturally ventilated animal installations (Mueller and Krause, 2007). \n\n\n\n39\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nVarious studies involving mathematical modeling and computational simulations have \n\nbeen developed during experimentation to improve understanding of the processes \n\ninvolved in the transfer of heat and mass between animals and their thermal environment. \n\n \n\n2.8. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) \n\nComputational fluid dynamics (CFD) can be defined as a numerical resolution based \n\non computational loops and the equations of mass, momentum and energy conservation for \n\nphysical systems (Miranda, 2009). The method works by solving the equations of \n\ntransporting mass and energy and momentum through a process number called difference \n\nnumerical methods. Figure 2.7 illustrates the initial work of the numerical method, which is \n\ndiscretize the domain in a number of non-coincident sub-domains forming a grid of small \n\nelements (or volume control) to which a discrete solution can be obtained. For this, some \n\ntransformations are performed in differential transport equations, defined continuously in \n\nthe domain, in a system of algebraic equations for the discretized Domain (Maliska, 1995). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.7 - The initial work of the numerical method: discretize the continuous domain \n(Maliska, 1995). \n\n \n\nThe CFD methodology was initially and widely used in aerospace industry, \n\nautomotive, naval, and nuclear. Recently it has been applied in agricultural engineering. \n\nThe availability of high-performance, low cost computers and with the emergence of CFD \n\nprograms with friendly interfaces, has allowed great advances in the use of this technique \n\nsince the 90's. Moreover, the versatility and generality of the numerical methods for \n\nsimulation of engineering problems, and the relative simplicity of application of these \n\ntechniques are other factors motivating the use of CFD. \n\nThis technique provides precise solutions as well as visualizations of velocity, \n\npressures, temperature, turbulence and gas concentrations in the entire space of the animal \n\n\n\n40\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ninstallation without various physical scale test models. Results allow that engineers and \n\noperators to develop new ventilation strategies to meet the standards for air quality (Lee \n\nand Short, 2000). \n\nModeling in CFD is important to predict mass transport in different types of animal \n\nstructures, especially when field measurement of the variables related to the model is \n\ndifficult. In the case of modeling gas emission that eliminate from inside the installations, \n\nfor example NH3, the computational models are based on the NH3 transport process and the \n\ntransport mechanism to the atmosphere (Bjerg et al., 2002). \n\nCurrently, sophisticated commercial CFD programs like CFX (ANSYS CFX 13.0, \n\n2011), can run on personal computers in the workplace and even at home. Also the costs of \n\nthe required equipment acquisition are getting smaller. Thus, it becomes easier to use \n\nnumerical techniques for solving engineering problems.,  \n\nUndertaking a CFD study demands the use of four predefined environments within the \n\nsoftware, with each environment representing an equally important section of the modeling \n\nprocess. The following provides an introduction to the different modules comprising a CFD \n\nsoftware package: a) generating geometry and mesh; b) pre-processor; c) solver manager; \n\nand d) post-processor. \n\n \na) Geometry and mesh generator:  \n\nIt consist of insertion of problem into CFD code. The embedded information involves: \n\ni) Definition of geometry and solution domain: This step can be performed in a \n\nsecondary program; CAD (Computer Assisted Drawing) as SOLIDWORKS\u00ae or \n\nRhinoceros\u00ae and then imported by the CFD code, operation commonly performed when \n\nworking with CFX. \n\nii) Meshing: consists of discretization of a continuous domain into a set of discrete \n\nsub-domains, usually called elements. \n\nApproximately 50% of the time used in a CFD project is to define the geometry and \n\nmesh generation (Malalasekera and Versteeg, 1995). In CFX, DESIGNMODELER module \n\nis used to generate or import geometry and CFX-Mesh is used to generate the mesh. \n\n \nb) Pre-processing:  \n\nThe pre-processor of CFD software holds all the mathematical statements attributable \n\nto the potential success of a modeling exercise and therefore embodies the most important \n\n\n\n41\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nphase of model definition. The main tasks facing a user in the pre-processing environment \n\ninclude problem consideration, geometry creation or import, mesh development, physical \n\nproperty set-up, and the implementation of solving techniques and parameters. \n\n \nc) Solver manager:  \n\nThe solver environment, within all commercial CFD software packages, organizes the \n\nmathematical input from the pre-processor into numerical arrays and solves them by \n\niterative methods (Norton et al., 2007). Iterative methods are commonly used to solve a \n\nwhole set of discretized equations so that they may be applied to a single dependent \n\nvariable. Segregated solving techniques, such as Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure-Linked \n\nEquations (SIMPLE) used by most commercial CFD software packages, determine the \n\npressure field indirectly by closing the discretized momentum equations with the continuity \n\nequations in a sequential manner (Patankar and Spalding, 1972). However, as the number \n\nof cells increase the elliptic nature of the pressure field becomes more profound and the \n\nconvergence rate is inhibited. This has led to the development of multigrid techniques that \n\ncompute velocity and pressure corrections in a simultaneous fashion, thus enhancing \n\nconvergence rates (Ferry, 2002). \n\n \nd) Post-processor:  \n\nThe post-processing environment allows the user to visualize and investigates the \n\nresulting field solution. Contour, vector and line plots enhance interpretation of results and \n\nare being progressively fortified in commercial software packages. Some packages also \n\nallow the export of field data to external modeling programs so that it can be processed \n\nfurther (Norton et al., 2007). In CFX, the CFX-POST module is used for post-processing. \n\nThus, the complete analysis in CFD is composed of pre-processing, processing and \n\npost-processing, which includes the procedures and phenomena to adequately analyze the \n\nconfiguration of the problem with the solution, monitoring and analysis of results at the end \n\nof simulation (Rocha, 2012). \n\n \n2.8.1. ANSYS \n\nANSYS is a set of commercial software for numerical solutions in fluid dynamics \n\nmodeling and other physical phenomena with a multidisciplinary approach and the \n\npossibility of integration with other types of physical simulation technologies, which the \n\n\n\n42\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nmain tools for simulation and analysis of fluids are known by FLUENT and CFX (Xia and \n\nSun, 2002). \n\n \n2.8.2. Governing equations \n\nThe governing equations of fluid flow and heat transfer can be considered as \n\nmathematical formulations of the laws of conservation which regulate all fluid flows, heat \n\ntransfer and associated phenomena. These laws of conservation describe the rate of \n\nvariation of a desired fluid property as a function of external forces. \n\n \n\na) Conservation of mass: \n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that mass can neither be created or destroyed. \n\nThis is the basis for the continuity equation. It can be represented in Cartesian coordinates \n\nby the following equation (Rocha, 2012; Hirsch, 2007). \n\n \n\n? ? ? ? ? ?z? u? u ? u? = + +  = 0\nt\n\nyx\n\nx y z\n\n? ?? ? ? ??\n? ? ? ?\n\n (2.4) \n\n \nwhere,  \n\nt is the time (s); \n\n? is the density (kg m-3); \n\nx, y, z are the coordinate direction; \n\nux, uy, uz are the velocity in the directions x, y, z respectively. \n\n \n\nb) Conservation of momentum: \n\nThe sum of the external forces acting on the fluid particle is equal to its rate of change \n\nof linear momentum (Rocha, 2012). \n\n \n\n\t\n\t \t\t\n\n\t\n\n\tu ? u ? ? \t ?\t ? ? ?    (2.5) \n\n \nwhere, \n\n? is the kinematic viscosity (m2 s-1); \n\nP is the pressure (Pa). \n\n\n\n43\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThe equation for the moment can be described by the following expression. \n\n \n\n?\t?\tui\n?u\n\n?i\n?\t?\tuj\n\n?u\n\n?j\n\nInertia\n\n? ?\n?P\n\n?i\n\t\n\nPressure\n\n?\n?2u\n\n?i2\n??\n\n?2u\n\n?j2\n\nFriction\n\n  (2.6) \n\n \n\nc) Conservation of energy: \n\nThe equation for the conservation of the energy is derived from considerations of the \n\nfirst law of thermodynamics. The rate of change of energy of a fluid particle is equal to the \n\nheat addition and the work done on the particle (Rocha, 2012). \n\n \n\n\tui\n?T\n\n?i\n\tuj\n\n?T\n\n?j\n?\n\n?2T\n\n?i2\n??\n\n?2T\n\n?j2\n? (2.7) \n\n \n\nwhere,  \n\nT is the temperature (K); \n\n? is the viscous dissipation (K s-1); \n\n? is the thermal diffusivity (m2 s-1). \n\n \n\n2.8.3. Method solution \n\nTwo methodologies are used to solve the system of equations: segregated solver \n\nsolution and coupled solution. The method employs a numerical strategy solution, where \n\nthe equations of conservation of momentum are solved with a estimated pressure, and then \n\na correction equation for the pressure is applied. Because of the nature of this methodology \n\nof correction estimation, a large number of iterations, and a very careful selection of the \n\nsignificant parameters affecting the convergence of a numerical parameters are necessary, \n\nin the case of steady state (Santos, 2008). \n\nThe coupled method, used by CFX, solves the hydrodynamic equations as a single \n\nsystem. Figure 2.8 illustrates the general procedure of solution. The solution of equations \n\nfor each set consists of two intensive numerical operations, for each step in time. \n\n \n\n\n\n44\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nFigure 2.8 - Overall solution strategy of CFX (ANSYS CFX 13.0, 2011). \n\n \nThe iteration time is controlled by a step of physical time, global, or a false time step, \n\nlocally configured to advance the solution for a simulation time in continuous operation. If \n\nthe model is steady state, there is only one interaction of linearization step of virtual time. \n\nThe solution's performance is improved with the use of a technique called Multigrid \n\n(Brandt, 1977), a process to increase the size of the mesh elements for later iterations. This \n\nresults in a reduction of virtual quality of the spacing of the mesh during the iteration, and \n\nreturn to the original mesh obtaining an accurate solution. The use of this technique \n\nsignificantly improves the convergence rate. \n\nThe CFX uses a particular implementation of the algebraic Multigrid called correction \n\nadditive (Hutchinson and Raithby, 1986). This approach is ideally suited to the ANSYS \n\n\n\n45\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nCFX-Solver implementation, because it takes advantage of the fact that the discrete \n\nequations are representative of the balance of conserved quantities over a control volume. \n\nThe coarse mesh equations can be created by merging the original control volumes to \n\ncreate larger ones as shown in Figure 2.9. Figure 2.9 shows the merged coarse control \n\nvolume meshes to be regular, but in general their shape becomes very irregular. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.9 - Scheme of an algebraic Multigrid method. \n\n \n2.8.4. Simulation in CFD for animal facilities \n\nThe first studies using livestock installations in CFD were performed by Choi et al. \n\n(1988), in which a simple geometry was used to represent the animal installation, but \n\nresults showed little precision. Small advances in the development of real solutions were \n\nmade in the next year. Hoff et al. (1992) utilized CFD to model air flow in a rectangular \n\nshaped installation, in which heat transfer was modeled using a heated floor. Harral and \n\nBoon (1997) later simulated isothermal flow patterns in a 3D geometric representation of a \n\ncattle confinement. In following years, more studies were developed for validation of \n\nanimal installations with a focus on the creation of more precise CFD models (Zhang et al., \n\n2000). Only in recent years have CFD models used for simulation of heat and mass transfer \n\n\n\n46\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nin a geometric representation become reliable in animal production installations (Van \n\nWagenberg et al., 2004). Therefore, more detailed conditions are provided of all \n\nphenomena that occur when CFD is employed, and dynamic models, together with \n\nestimates, are provided. \n\n \na) Birds:  \n\nAmong environmental factors, thermal factors represented by air temperature, relative \n\nhumidity, thermal radiation, and air movement are those which most directly affect the bird \n\nsince they are warm-blooded animals. These environmental variables may have either \n\npositive of negative effects on bird production. High temperature and high relative \n\nhumidities inside aviculture installations are factors which limit the achievement of optimal \n\nproductivity (Damasceno et al., 2010a). Therefore, the need to maintain the thermal \n\nenvironment within an optimal production scale is evident. However, there are few studies \n\nwith CFD which utilize a mass balance and heat transfer inside aviculture facilities. \n\nWorley and Manbeck (1995) utilized a CFD model to analyze the distribution of \n\ncontaminants in a highly turbulent flow inside an aviculture installation under different \n\nroofing configurations, whose objective was to obtain a better configuration of air \n\ncirculation to eliminate particulate material.  \n\nPawar et al. (2007) analyzed the distribution of virus particles which generate diseases \n\nin aviculture installations, and for this considered an analogy between the diffusion of \n\nammonia gas (NH3) and dispersion of virus particles. \n\nDamasceno et al. (2010b) developed and validated a CFD model to analyze the \n\ntemperature and air velocity distribution inside a common commercial heater used in \n\nBrazilian poultry production. These authors concluded that the CFD models may be used \n\nfor real time prediction of thermal behavior and velocity distribution (inside the \n\ncombustion chamber for heating), aiding in project improvements. \n\nTin\u00f4co et al. (2010) used CFD to simulate an aviculture installation with mechanical \n\nventilation associated with an evaporative cooling system. In this study the authors \n\ndeveloped a CFD model to obtain a better understanding of the temperature and air velocity \n\ndistribution inside the aviculture installation. The obtained results showed a good statistical \n\ncorrelation with experimental data, which permits its use to address future modifications to \n\nthe installation. \n\n \n\n\n\n47\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nb) Cattle: \n\nThe air quality conditions in a cattle confinement are dynamic and change \n\ncontinuously. Pollutant gases and excesses of humidity, microorganisms and particulates \n\nare produced from various sources, such as the floors, walls, feeds, water and air which \n\ninfiltrates the installation. Therefore gas emissions directly depend on atmospheric \n\ninfluences which permanently change the conditions. \n\nVarious approaches to solve this problem have been studied. The quantification of \n\ncarbon dioxide as well as mass and heat balances were performed by Van Ouwerkerk and \n\nPedersen (1994) according to a method for calculating the concentration difference \n\nbetween interior and exterior air to determine the concentration levels.  \n\nGebremedhin and Wu (2003) utilized predictions based on CFD simulations to aid in \n\nmodeling of the thermal environment in dairy cattle installations. In their study, the Fortran \n\ncomputational program was used to calculate all models which were necessary for \n\ndetermination of heat and mass transfer on the body of these animals. These authors thus \n\nused this method together with CFD simulations for heat and mass transfer between \n\nanimals and the environment. \n\nGebremedhin and Wu (2005) studied the utilization of CFD simulations for air flux in \n\na simple geometric cattle installation with forced ventilation to investigate the heat and \n\nmass transfer phenomena. They discovered that the total heat loss of an animal is highly \n\ndependent on its position and orientation for the flow field. For example, a cow positioned \n\nnear the air entrance may lose a total of 710 W in heat, while an animal positioned at the \n\nother extremity of the installation may lose only 214 W of heat. Figure 2.10 illustrates a \n\nCFD predicted flow field around cows in a ventilated room. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 2.10 - Difference in the air velocity around cows in a ventilated room. \n(Gebremedhin and Wu, 2005). \n\n \n\n\n\n48\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nNorton et al. (2010a) used a CFD model to provide insight into the air mixing \n\ncharacteristics in a calf building during wind-driven and wind and buoyancy-influenced \n\nventilation. This study found the porosity of the eave opening cladding system heavily \n\ninfluenced the mixing of indoor air during wind-driven ventilation, with the low porosity \n\ncladding significantly enhancing the building\u2019s ventilation efficiency. Figure 2.11 shows \n\nthe simulated air distribution patterns in the calves building. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.11 - The predicted flow patterns on a vertical plane in the calves building with a \nwind speed of 0.5 m s-1 (Norton et al., 2010a). \n\n \n\nc) Swine: \n\nProduction and reproductive performance of swine depend on the employed \n\nmanagement system, which involves the selected system of breeding, nutrition, and the \n\ninstallations themselves. These installations, which demand a large initial investment, are \n\nconstructed in function of the costs and facilities of the caretaker, often neglecting the \n\ncomfort of the animals. Thus, many times the application of CFD models on the \n\nenvironment of these animals are directed towards the optimization of environmental \n\nconditions (Bjerg et al., 2000; Sun et al., 2002; Sun, 2004). These studies may be \n\nefficiently grouped for modeling of pollutant dispersion and the thermal environment \n\ninside swine production installations. \n\nSun (2004), utilizing CFD models for two and three dimensions, obtained good results \n\nfor the determination of ammonia concentration distributions during summer and winter \n\nconditions in a commercial High-Rise\u2122 Hog Building (HRHB). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n49\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n2.9. Reduced models \n\nThe use of reduced models is a widely used tool in engineering, but its use requires a \n\nclear understanding of the principles governing the relationship between the model and \n\nprototype. For the behavior of a prototype can be derived from a model is necessary that \n\nboth behave in a qualitatively similar and that a quantitative relationship can be established \n\namong them (Jentzsch, 2002). \n\nReduced models, when examined with certain criteria of similarity, can be substitutes \n\nfor valid systems that, for some reason cannot be studied in full-size prototypes. The scale \n\nutilization of physical phenomena can be advantageous for four reasons (Schuring, 1977):  \n\na) When the problem is treated as very complex or unfamiliar, and empirical \n\ninformation is necessary for an analytical approach; \n\nb) Reduced models allow the reduction ratio of the system to facilitate the handling; \n\nc) Allows a reduction in time required to perform the research; and \n\nd) Provides a greater understanding of the phenomenon investigated. \n\n \n\nThe similarity theory is developed by dimensional analysis. Objectives establish the \n\nnecessary relations for the behavior of a prototype and can be determined from \n\nobservations in a model and the relationships between the variables involved in the \n\nphenomenon, so that the data can be systematized safely (K\u00f6ltzsch and Walden, 1990). \n\nThe high cost involved in building a structure for agricultural research of new \n\ntechnologies, such as dairy housing, often do not include the execution of a study due to \n\nlimited resources. In this way, the use of reduced models to study various types of roof \n\nridge and effects on natural ventilation in a dairy housing can contribute significantly to \n\nreducing the cost of research, and allows testing various settings by changing the model at \n\na lower cost than in a full-scale prototype. \n\nThe use of reduced building models for animal production are mainly limited by the \n\ndifficulty of performing the tests under production conditions, thus simulating the heat and \n\nmoisture dissipation by the animals must be added to the system. \n\nThe use of scale models to study the behavior of physical phenomena of a system, \n\nexpanded with the development of the theory of similarity from the 19th century. This \n\ndevelopment was due to the need to understand the behavior of physical phenomena \n\ninvolved in new technologies generated mainly in the aerospace industry and shipbuilding. \n\n\n\n50\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nIn this way, several models have been proposed to solve field problems and to facilitate the \n\nunderstanding of various physical processes, such as air-flow characteristics of a scale \n\nmodel chamber (Weller et al., 1970), reduced model to study of alternative ventilation \n\nsystems for a broiler house (Wilson and Bishop, 1974), ridge vent and wind direction \n\neffects on ventilation characteristics of a model livestock building (Egan and Hellickson, \n\n1977), algorithm for determining opening effectiveness in natural ventilation by wind \n\n(N\u00e4\u00e4s et al., 1998), and others. \n\nAn important factor in making reduced models is the relationship between cost and \n\naccuracy or quality. If the cost increases with the requirement of accuracy of the model, it \n\nis necessary to establish the standard that meets the proposed objectives, see Figure 2.12. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.12 - Relationship between cost and accuracy of the model. Adapted from K\u00f6ltzsch \nand Walden (1990). \n\n \n\n2.9.1. Similitude theory \n\nMany problems in practical engineering, involving heat and mass transport over time, \n\ncan be modeled using solved equations and procedures to describe processes. But a large \n\nnumber of problems can be solved only if the mathematical models are related to the \n\nexperimental data (Rocha, 2012). \n\nA mathematical model describes the behavior of a real-life system in terms of \n\nmathematical equations. These equations represent the relations between the relevant \n\nproperties of the system under consideration. Parameters that can be influenced by the \n\nobserver are referred to as adjustable. The other parameters act as constants in the model. \n\nFor example, in atmospheric models used in weather forecasting, one is interested in \n\nproperties like temperature and humidity (the dependent variables) as functions of position \n\n\n\n51\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nand time (the independent variables). Important parameters are then the gravity field and \n\nthe rotational speed of the earth, and these clearly belong to the class of nonadjustable \n\nparameters. The solution of a mathematical model is known if we can determine the \n\nrelations between dependent and independent variables. Since the solution depends on the \n\nvalues of the adjustable parameters, mathematical models are a powerful tool with which to \n\ndetermine which values of the adjustable parameters yields specific required behavior. \n\nThe basic considerations of dimensional analysis and similarity theory are also used to \n\nassist the engineer to understand and correlate the data that were obtained in their study or \n\nby other researchers. One objective of experimental research is to analyze the systems to \n\nmake them applicable. Thus, the concept of similarity is often used (Vekariya et al., 2011).  \n\nIn the process of construction of scientific knowledge, the  models have been used as \n\nthe link between research and theory. In this way, it means that the model productions and \n\nphysical reproductions of the processes, structures, and objects can be accomplished using \n\nthe homology and analogy. In homology, the original and model have the same basic \n\nphysical qualities, and the difference between them is mainly quantitative (Jentzsch, 2002).  \n\nThe use of homology results in physically similar models. However, in analogy, the \n\noriginal and model have different basic physical qualities, but have in common structural \n\nand functional characteristics. The use of models results in similar physical analogy \n\n(Murphy,1950). \n\nSo the prototype and the model are similar when all quantities homologous features \n\npresent a constant relationship between them, in other words, similarity between them are \n\nconstants (Jentzsch, 2002). These constants of similarity (cs) can be set for all magnitudes a \n\nbasic measurement system, such as length, mass, time, temperature (index M = model and \n\nP = prototype): \n\n \n\nLength\t ?\tcs   (2.8) \n\n \n\nMass\t ?\tcs   (2.9)  \n\n \n\nTime\t ?\tcs   (2.10) \n\n \n\nTemperature\t ?\tcs?\n?\n\n?\n  (2.11) \n\n\n\n52\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nBy combining these constants of similarity, one can obtain a variety of products, such \n\nas widely used dimensionless physical quantities (terms Pi), the Reynolds, Grashof, and \n\nPrandtl numbers (Jentzsch, 2002).  \n\n \n\n2.9.2. Buckingham Pi -Theorem \n\nThe Buckingham theorem provides a method for computing sets of dimensionless \n\nparameters from the given variables, even if the form of the equation is still unknown. \n\nThereby, according Murphy (1950), consider a system with variables x1, x2, x3,. . . , xn and \n\na function between them: \n\n \n\n\u0192(x1, x2, x3, ... , xn) = 0  (2.12) \n\n \n\nIf k is the number of fundamental dimensions required to describe the n variables, then \n\nthere will be k primary variables and the remaining s = k \u2013 n variables can be expressed as \n\nn \u2013 k dimensionless and independent quantities or Pi groups. Thus, the function f can be \n\nreplaced by the function: \n\n \n\u0192(?1, ? 2, ? 3, ... , ? s) = 0  (2.13) \n\n \n\nThe previous function can be determined if the term ?1 had a intended dependent \n\nvariable, then: \n\n?1 = \u0192(?2, ?3, ... , ?s)  (2.14) \n\n \n\nThus, Equation 2.14 is general and can be applied to any other system that is a \n\nfunction of these variables, and consequently a particular system called model (index M). \n\n \n\n?1M = \u0192(?2M, ?3M, ... , ?sM)  (2.15) \n\n \n\nThus, can one can obtain a prediction equation for ?1 from ?1M through division \n\nEquation 2.14 by Equation 2.15. \n\n \n\n\n\n53\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n? ?\n? ?\n\n2 3 s1\n\n1M 2M 3M sM\n\nf ? , ? ,..., ??\n=\n\n? f ? , ? ,..., ?\n (2.16) \n\n \n\nIf the model is designed and operated as follows below: \n\n \n\n?2M = ?2  (2.17) \n\n?3M = ?3 \n\n?sM = ?s \n\n \n\nThen, \n\n \n\n\u0192(?2, ?3, ... , ?s) = \u0192(?2M, ?3M, ... , ?sM)  (2.18) \n\n \n\nAnd consequently: \n\n \n\n?1M = ?1  (2.19) \n\n \n\nEquation 2.19 is the prediction equation, which will be valid only if the operating \n\nconditions and project demands are fulfilled (Murphy, 1950). \n\nOn the other hand, if it is not found that all design criteria and operating conditions \n\naffecting the prediction equation are not met, then this may change the behavior of the \n\nmodel, (Timmons et al, 1978). Thus, the correction of the prediction equation can be made \n\nby determining predictive factor ?, so (Murphy, 1950): \n\n \n\n?1 = ??1M  (2.20) \n\n \n\n2.9.3. Models versus prototype \n\nPerforming scale analysis is mathematically straightforward. However, there are \n\nseveral issues to consider (Bahrami, 2012): \n\na) List of variables that are involved in the phenomenon under investigation: Selection \n\nof important variables is not a trivial task and requires considerable judgment and \n\nexperience. \n\n\n\n54\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nb) Reynolds number: generally the prototype has a very large Reynolds number (Re), \n\nin which case slight variation in Re causes little effect on the behavior of the problem. \n\nUnfortunately, models are sometimes so small and the Reynolds numbers are large and the \n\nviscous effects take effect. This situation should be avoided to achieve correct results. \n\nSolutions to this problem would be to increase the size of the model, or more difficult, to \n\nchange the fluid (change the viscosity of the fluid) to reduce the Re. \n\nc) After selecting important parameters and determining Pi groups, one should seek to \n\nachieve similarity between the model tested and the prototype to be designed. In general, \n\nflow conditions for a model test are completely similar if all relevant dimensionless \n\nparameters have the same corresponding values for the model and the prototype. Therefore, \n\nthree particular types of similarity can be determined. \n\ni) Geometric similarity: concerns the length dimension (L) and it must be ensured \n\nbefore any model testing can proceed. In general geometrical similarity is established when \n\na model and prototype are geometrically similar when all body dimensions in all 3 \n\ncoordinates have the same linear scale ratio. \n\nFigure 2.13 is showing a general example of geometric similarity in model testing. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.13 - Geometric similarity in model testing (Bahrami, 2012). \n\n \n\nii) Kinematic similarity: requires that the model and prototype have the same length \n\nscale ratio and the same time scale ratio; thus the velocity scale ratio will be the same for \n\nboth. \n\nLength scale equivalence simply implies geometric similarity, but time scale \n\nequivalence may require additional dynamic considerations such as equivalence of the \n\nReynolds and Mach numbers. \n\n \n\n\n\n55\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\niii) Dynamic similarity: exists when the model and the prototype have the same length \n\nscale ratio, time scale ratio, and the force scale (mass scale) ratio. \n\nDynamic similarity exists, simultaneously with kinematic similarity, if the model and \n\nprototype force and pressure coefficients are identical. This is established if:  \n\n- For compressible flow: the model and prototype Reynolds number and Mach number \n\nand specific heat ratio are correspondingly equal. \n\n- For incompressible flow:  \n\nWith no free surface: model and prototype Reynolds numbers are equal; \n\nWith a free surface: model and prototype Reynolds number, Froude number, and (if \n\nnecessary) Weber number and cavitation number are correspondingly equal. \n\n \n2.10. Wind tunnel \n\nRoberts (2001) describes hydrodynamics as the study of how fluids and gases move \n\naround an object. He further states that the study of hydrodynamics is important in that \n\nfluid movements help determine the shape and function of many vehicles and building \n\nstructures. \n\nKonstantin Tsiolkovsky conducted experiments in the study of fluid movement in 1892. \n\nHe developed prototypes of wind tunnels to study and measure aerodynamic concepts. His \n\ncontributions helped lead to the understanding of aerodynamics employed by race car \n\ndrivers, pilots and engineers today (Fitzgerald, 2005). Although CFD have added another \n\ndimension in testing recently, wind tunnels are still used to familiarize and appreciate \n\naerodynamic forces at work. It is essential to recognize fluid properties and changes that \n\naffect the accuracy throughout the test section (Husainie and Qamar, 2012). \n\nIn general, Agriculture Engineers have used wind tunnels to study mockups and \n\nprototypes of animal building and food storage structures. They collect data so they can \n\ndesign a better structure. They may use a wind tunnel to study the ventilation \n\ncharacteristics of a mockup before spending money on a prototype building. They also \n\ninvestigate  the characteristics of the building, how the control surfaces react at various air \n\nvelocity and drag characteristics. \n\nWind tunnels represent a useful tool to investigate various flow phenomena (Lindgren \n\nand Johansson, 2002). In another words, the wind tunnel is an installation producing a \n\nregular and controlled air stream to determine experimentally the conditions of flow and to \n\nmeasure distribution of pressures, monitoring the temperature, and other relevant aspects of \n\n\n\n56\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nthe study (Gorecki, 1988). With various features provided by wind tunnels, these results \n\ncan be classified according to the position of construction (vertical or horizontal), the type \n\nof camera (open or closed) and the fluid velocity (from subsonic to hypersonic). \n\nConcerning buildings, horizontal models are the most used, due to convenience and \n\nlower cost of construction. The use of an open or closed chamber will depend on the type \n\nof study to be performed, as well as the fluid velocity and body size needed to meet the test \n\nobjectives (Barlow et al., 1999). \n\nThere are two basic types of wind tunnels and two basic test-section configurations \n\n(Rae and Pope, 1984): \n\n1) Open circuit tunnel: In this type of tunnel the air follows along a straight path from \n\nthe entrance through a contraction to the test section, followed by a diffuser, a fan section, \n\nand an exhaust of the air. The tunnel may have a test section with  or without solid \n\nboundaries, see Figure 2.14. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.14 - Schematic of open return tunnel (Adapted from Mueller, 1989). \n\n \nAn open circuit tunnel has the following advantages and disadvantages (Rae and Pope, \n\n1984). \n\na) Advantages: \n\ni) Construction cost is less; \n\nii) If one intends to run internal combustion engines or if there is flow visualization via \n\nsmoke, there is no purging problem if both inlet and exhaust are open to the atmosphere. \n\nb) Disadvantages: \n\ni) If located in a room, depending on the size of the tunnel to the room size, it may \n\nrequire extensive screening at the inlet to get high-quality flow. The same may be true if \n\n\n\n57\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nthe inlet and/or exhaust is open to the atmosphere, when wind and cold weather can affect \n\noperation; \n\nii) For a given size and speed the tunnel will require more energy to run. This is usually \n\na factor only if used for developmental testing where the tunnel has a high utilization rate; \n\niii) In general, a tunnel is nosy. For larger tunnels noise may cause environmental \n\nproblems and limits on hours of operations. \n\n \nBecause of the low initial cost, an open circuit is often ideal for schools and universities \n\nwhere a tunnel is required for classroom work and research and high utilization is not \n\nrequired. \n\n \n2) Closed return wind tunnel: This tunnel has a continuous path for the air. The great \n\nmajority of the closed circuit tunnels have a single return (Figure 2.16), although tunnels \n\nwith both double and annular returns have been built. Again, the closed circuit tunnel may \n\nhave either a closed or open test section, and some have been built where it can be run with \n\neither an open or closed test section. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.15 - Schematic of closed return wind tunnel (Adapted from Tatman, 2006). \n\n \n\nA closed return tunnel has the following advantages and disadvantages (Rae and Pope, \n\n1984). \n\na) Advantages: \n\ni) Through the use of corner turning vanes and possibly screens, the quality of the flow \n\ncan be easily controlled; \n\n\n\n58\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nii) Less energy is required for a given test-section size and velocity; \n\niii) Less noise when operating. \n\n \nb) Disadvantages: \n\ni) Higher initial cost due to return ducts and corner vanes; \n\nii) If used extensively for smoke tests or running of internal combustion engines, there \n\nmust be a way to purge tunnel; \n\niii) If tunnel has high utilization, it will be necessary to install an air exchanger or some \n\nother method of cooling during hot summer months. \n\n \nThe Reynolds number is the basis for the behavior of real systems when  using reduced \n\nphysical models (Fox and McDonald, 1998). A common example is the wind tunnel that is \n\nused to measure aerodynamic forces in models of wings of airplanes, automobiles, and \n\nbuildings. Thereby, in the ideal case, the model should be tested at the same Reynolds \n\nnumber as the full-scale vehicle or building. Typically, for experimental values, the flow is \n\nlaminar when Re &lt;2100, and it is turbulent when Re > 4000 (Fox and McDonald, 1998; \n\nIncropera and Dewitt, 2001).  \n\nIn most wind tunnels, air at atmospheric pressure is used as the fluid. The gases are \n\ncompressible and density varies with temperature and pressure. But in many cases the \n\ndensity of air can be considered constant, to assist engineer in calculating accurate results \n\n(Barlow et al., 1999). \n\n \n2.10.1. Wind tunnel design \n\nWind tunnel design is a complex field involving many fluid mechanics and engineering \n\naspects and it is impossible to cover them all in just a few pages. Some books and articles \n\nhave been written about this topic and some references are useful references when \n\ndesigning and constructing low-speed wind-tunnels (Bradshaw and Pankhurst, 1964; Rae \n\nand Pope, 1984). \n\nThere are many types of wind-tunnels and they can be classified by flow speed dividing \n\nthem into four groups (Lindgren and Johansson, 2002): a) Subsonic or low-speed wind-\n\ntunnels; b) Transonic wind-tunnels; c) Supersonic wind-tunnels; d) Hypersonic wind-\n\ntunnels. \n\n\n\n59\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThere are special-purpose subsonic tunnels, such as spin tunnels, icing tunnels, \n\nmeteorological tunnels, and tunnels designed for the testing of buildings. In this study, a \n\nsubsonic tunnel was built for the evaluation of the air flow in reduced models of CBP \n\nbarns. \n\nThere are some large wind-tunnels used in the auto and aircraft industries. These \n\ntunnels have test sections that can accommodate full scale vehicles and small aircraft \n\n(Lindgren and Johansson, 2002). In the medium size tunnels with a test-section area around \n\n9.3 m2, large amounts of both research and aircraft developmental testing  is accomplished. \n\nIn a smaller size test section, the tunnels are used for research and instructional purposes. \n\nThe size of smaller tunnels is usually determined in the final analysis by the size of the \n\nroom that will house the tunnel. Ideally, the size of a tunnel is determined by its purpose \n\n(Rae and Pope, 1984). \n\n \na) Test section: \n\nThis is the starting point in the design of a wind tunnel. The purpose of  a wind tunnel \n\nis to provide a uniform and controllable air flow in the test section that passes over the \n\nmodel (Rae and Pope, 1984). The test section is the chamber in which measurements and \n\nobservations are made and its shape and size are largely determined by the testing \n\nrequirements.  \n\nThe test section should be long enough that flow disturbances resulting from a \n\ncontraction or screens are sufficiently damped before the reaching the test object. However, \n\ncare should be taken not to make this section too long as this will lead to detrimental \n\nboundary layer growth which can separate when it enters the exit diffuser and create a \n\npower loss. This can be prevented by slightly enlarging the tunnel or by partially \n\nobstructing the exit end of the tunnel to create an overpressure which allows the use of \n\nsmall vents to control boundary layer growth (Tatman, 2006). \n\n \nb) Diffuser: \n\nDiffusers are chambers that slowly expand along their length, allowing fluid pressure to \n\nincrease with decreasing fluid velocity. Angles slightly larger than 5 degrees do increase \n\npressure recovery, but can also lead to boundary layer separation and thus flow \n\nunsteadiness. Exit diffusers are located downstream of the test section and are used to \n\n\n\n60\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nrecover pressure from kinetic motion of the fluid thereby reduced the power required to \n\ndrive the tunnel (Tatman, 2006). \n\nWide angle diffusers are located between the fan and the settling chamber and are \n\nnecessary in order to facilitate the use of a beneficial contraction section, but the wide \n\nangle leads to boundary layer separation which must be controlled with the use of screens. \n\n \nc) Contractions sections: \n\nContractions sections are located between the settling chamber and the test sections and \n\nserve to both increase mean velocities at the test section inlet and moderate inconsistencies \n\nin the uniformity of the flow. Large contraction ratios and short contraction lengths are \n\ngenerally more desirable as they reduce the power loss across the screens and the thickness \n\nof boundary layers. Small tunnels typically have contraction ratios between 6 and 9. \n\n \nd) Fan section: \n\nAxial fans are popular in open return tunnels, and are almost always found in closed \n\nreturn tunnels. In larger tunnels, pre-rotation vanes called stators are commonly positioned \n\nupstream of the fan, substantially decreasing swirl in the exit flow. Axial fans have a \n\nrelatively limited effective operating range as the reduction it pressure increase through the \n\nfan as the blades approach stall speeds is far more abrupt than in centrifugal blowers. Care \n\nmust also be given to choosing the proper blade size, shape and spacing in order to prevent \n\nshock wave production, stalling, and backflow (Wallis, 1983). \n\nCentrifugal blowers are most often in blower type open return tunnels, though they can \n\nbe used in closed return tunnels if mounted in a corner. Centrifugal blowers have a much \n\nlarger operating range than axial fans with acceptable levels of unsteadiness (Johnson and \n\nHancock, 1997). \n\n \ne) Settling chamber: \n\nThe settling chamber is located between the fan or wide angle diffuser and the \n\ncontraction and contains the honeycombs and screens used to moderate longitudinal \n\nvariations in the flow. Screens in the chamber should be spaced at 0.2 chamber diameters \n\napart so that flow disturbed by the first screen can settle before it encounters the second \n\n(Tatman, 2006). Turbulence in the test section is reduced by the installation of honeycombs \n\nand screens upstream of the contraction.  \n\n\n\n61\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nScreens reduce the axial turbulence more than lateral turbulence. Screens have a \n\nrelatively large pressure drop in the flow direction, which reduces the higher velocities \n\nmore than the lower, and thus promote a more uniform axial velocity (Rae and Pope, \n\n1984). \n\nHoneycombs have a small pressure drops and thus have less effect on axial velocities, \n\nbut owing to their length, they reduce the lateral velocities. The minimum length of a \n\nhoneycomb should be 6 - 8 times the diameter of the hole (Rae and Pope, 1984).  \n\nBoth screens and honeycombs reduce lateral and axial turbulence, probably due to an \n\nexchange in energy along the axis as the turbulence tends toward isotropic turbulence \n\ndownstream. \n\n \n2.10.2. Flow visualization \n\nIn this field of hydrodynamics science, the flow visualization has been a nebulous \n\nobservation simply because air is invisible. Flow visualization has led to the discovery of \n\nflow phenomena and has helped in the development of mathematical models for complex \n\nflow problems. It is also useful in the verification of existing theories, and has been an \n\nimportant tool in the development of complicated engineering systems (Mueller, 1989).  \n\nThe use of saw dust, tufts, fluorescent dye in oil with black light, and laser beam, are \n\nsome of the methods and materials used to attempt flow visualization. The use of saw dust \n\nincreases the difficulty of maintenance in the wind tunnel and its associated equipment. \n\nThe tuft and oil methods show flow on the surface of the model. The laser beam has not yet \n\nbeen perfected as a usable tool for this purpose (Shindo and Brask, 1969).  \n\nMitchell and Ross (1977), and Ogilvie and Boyd (1984) used a water flume to visualize \n\nthe airflow patterns in naturally ventilated barns while Aynsley et al. (1977) and Simango \n\nand Schulte (1983) used a neutral buoyancy bubble technique in a wind tunnel. Whatever \n\nthe method used, the substance introduced into the tunnel should be non-corrosive, non-\n\ntoxic, and the equipment must be safe to handle. Because of their high initial costs, neither \n\nof these two techniques was used in this study. Rather, a simple wind tunnel with smoke \n\nwas used to allow qualitative determination of air patterns. \n\nThe smoke tunnel was an important research tool since 1959. The system consists of a \n\nlow-turbulence wind tunnel, smoke-generation and injection apparatuses, and lighting and \n\nphotographic equipment. The arrangement and use of these system components must be \n\ncoordinated to obtain good results (Mueller, 1989). \n\n\n\n62\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n3 - MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n \n\n3.1. Introduction \n\nThis chapter is divided into four main sections based upon the chronology of the \n\ninvestigation: i) Summarize compost bed data, barn dimension data and determine from \n\nqualitative and quantitative methods major interactive factors in the success of bed \n\ncomposting; ii) Summarize bed compost water holding capacities (WHC)\u00a0 and compare \n\nmoisture contents found with water holding capacity to determine the influence of moisture \n\non bed compost; iii) Develop predictive equations for thermal properties of compost as a \n\nfunction of at various combinations of moisture content, pressure, and particle size; and iv) \n\nDevelop 3-D CFD model of compost barn with alternate ridge designs and visually \n\ndemonstrate effect on air flow through structure.  \n\n \n3.2. Characterization and description of CBP barns \n\n3.2.1. Barn facilities measurements \n\nData to realization of this study were collected from different CBP barns, distributed \n\nthroughout the state of Kentucky - U.S. (Figure 3.1), between October 2010 to March \n\n2011. In this way, if a farmer described the barn as a compost bedded pack barn but the \n\npack was rarely or never stirred, the barn was not included in any data analysis. Thus, \n\nforty-two farms participated in the study. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 - CBP barns utilized of this study in Kentucky State. \n\n\n\n63\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThe barn dimensions were measured using a steel tape measure, surveyor`s tape, level \n\nrod, and a measuring wheel (Figure 3.2). Roof pitch was determined using a level and \n\nframing square placed directly on the roof. Two fiberglass ladders were used to allow \n\naccess to roof structures and ventilation fans (Figure 3.3). Digital photography was used \n\nextensively to document interior and exterior structures and systems to assist in accurate \n\ncreation of the database of barn structure, layout and ventilation details. All information \n\nwas recorded in a notebook. \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 3.2 - Equipments used to measure CBP barn dimension: (a) surveyor`s tape and (b) \n\nmeasuring wheel. \n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 3.3 - Equipments used to measured roof pitch and fans dimension: (a) Level and \n\nframing square and (b) fiberglass ladders. \n \n3.2.2. Environmental measurements \n\nAir temperature, relative humidity, and air velocity and wind direction were measured \n\ninside and outside of each barn. At nine locations within a barn, measurements were taken \n\n\n\n64\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nin the compost pack area at two different heights (0.05 and 1.2 m) one time on the  day of \n\nthe site visit (Figure 3.4). Air temperature and relative humidity were measured using a \n\nweather meter (accuracy of \u00b11\u00b0C; Kestrel\u00ae, model 4000, Sylvan Lake, MI, USA). Air \n\nvelocity was measured using a hot wire anemometer (accuracy of \u00b10.01 m s-1; Testo\u00ae, \n\nmodel 425, Sparta, NJ, USA). The air direction was measurement with a weather vane. \n\nSampling points (A1 to A9) represent the approximate center of nine grid spaces within the \n\nmanure pack. The grids were established based on post spacing along the pack and \n\ngenerally along the center of the pack (Figure 3.5). \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 3.4 - Equipments used to measured environment: (a) hot wire anemometer and (b) \n\nweather meter. \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.5 - Nine grid spaces (A1 - A9) and one outside point (Poutside) of environmental \nmeasurements and samples collections inside of the barns. \n\n \n3.2.3. Bedding temperature measurements \n\nBedding temperature was measured at nine locations as previously described (Figure \n\n3.5) across each pack at the surface and at two different depths (0.10 and 0.20 m). Bedding \n\nHot wire \nanemometer\n\nWeather meter\n\nWeather meter\n\n\n\n65\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nsurface temperature was measured using two types of sensors. An infrared thermometer \n\n(accuracy of \u00b1 1\u00b0C; Fluke\u00ae, model 62, Everett, WA, USA) and a compact thermal camera \n\n(accuracy of \u00b1 0.1\u00b0C; Extech\u00ae, Flir i5, Waltham, MA, USA) were used (Figure 3.6). \n\nBedding temperature was measured using a thermocouple-based thermometer (0.22 m \n\nlength, accuracy of \u00b1 2.2\u00b0C; Fluke Inc., model 87, Everett, WA, USA), see Figure 3.7. \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 3.6 - Equipments used to measured bedding surface temperature: (a) infrared \n\nthermometer and (b) a picture of compact thermal camera. \n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 3.7 - Thermocouple-based thermometer used to measure bedding temperature. \n\n \n\n3.2.4. Bedding moisture analysis \n\nSamples of pack bedding were collected from a mixture of compost of the top (0.10 m) \n\nin nine different locations inside the barns using plastic bags (Ziploc\u00ae, Double Zipper, \n\nRacine, WI, USA). Samples were collected using an iron hoe with a wooden handle and a \n\nsoil auger (Figure 3.8). The bedding samples were cool on ice upon collection and \n\nrefrigerated when returned to lab at 1.0 \u00baC.  \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\nInfrared thermometer\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n66\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 3.8 - Equipments used to collect the bedding sample: iron hoe (a) and (b) storage in \nplastic bags. \n\n \n\nBedding compost moisture contents throughout this study were measured by drying at \n\n105\u00b0C for approximately 24 h (Figure 4.9). Moisture content (dry-basis) of bedding \n\ncompost was defined by Equation 4.1 (Sales, 2008; Melo, 2011). \n\n \n\nMC ? 100%                                                                              (4.1) \n\n \n\nWhere: mw is the mass of wet material (g) and md is the mass of dry material (g) \n\ndetermined by placement of the sample in a convective oven at 105oC for 24 hours.

Physical, chemical, bacterial and thermal properties of compost materials \n\n3.3.1. Sample preparation and characteristics of materials \n\nFresh compost bulking materials were collected from 42 CBP barns in Kentucky \n\n(Figure 3.1). The bedding compost samples were collected during farms visits between \n\nmid-October 2010 and early-February 2011. \n\nSamples of bedding compost were collected from the surface layer (0.10 m deep) in \n\nnine different locations in the resting area of a CBP barn (Figure 3.5).  Each location is the \n\ncenter of a rectangular area of a 3 x 3 m grid that divides the CBP resting area into 9 equal \n\nareas. Samples were collected using iron hoe and soil auger (Figure 3.8). A 20 liters \n\ncontainer was filled with incremental quantities of bedding collected from the nine \n\nlocation. The bedding compost samples were immediately refrigerated upon return to the \n\nlab at 1.0 \u00baC, see Figure 3.10. \n\n \n\n \n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 3.10 - The bedding compost samples refrigerated in container upon collection. \n\n \n\n3.3.2. Physical properties of compost materials \n\nPhysical analyses including particle size distribution, bulk density, particle density, \n\nporosity, water holding capacity were performed to characterize the compost materials. \n\n \n\n3.3.2.1. Particle size distribution \n\nAs-received compost was allowed to air-dry for 48 hours before the determination of \n\nthe particle size distribution (Figure 3.11a). Dried compost was poured in graduated \n\nvolume cylinders sieved in a sieve shaker (Ro-Tap Model B, W. S. Tyler, Inc., Mentor, \n\n\n\n68\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nOH, USA) with sieves vertically aligned in series in a decreasing mesh screen opening \n\norder: 25.00 mm, 8.00 mm, 5.60 mm, 4.75 mm, 2.00 mm and a pan of the bottom (Figure \n\n3.11b). Compost bedding material was sieved in the shaker for 3 minutes. The amount of \n\ncompost retained by each screen was poured in a beaker and its weight determined. \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 3.11 - As-received compost drying (a) and (b) shaker and sieves used to characterize \n\nparticle size ranges. \n \n\nThe total compost bedding sample weight (Wtotal) can be assumed as the sum of all \n\nsieved particle ranges plus bottom pan (Maia, 2010). So, Wtotal is given by Equation 3.2: \n\n \n\nW \tW W W W \tW \tW  (3.2) \n\n \n\nWhere, Wcourse, WR2, WR3, WR4, WR5, and Wfines represent weights of course material, R2, \n\nR3, R4, R5 and fines (pan), respectively.  \n\n \n\nParticle weight fractions for ranges 2, 3, 4, and 5 ( , , , and  \n\nrespectively) were determined by Equation 3.3: \n\nF\n#\n% \t # \t \t100 (3.3) \n\n \n\nWhere, WR# represents the weight for particles sizes of the three ranges.  \n\n \n\nCompost weight fraction of fines on the pan, (%), were calculated as in Eq. 3.4. \n\nF % \t \t \t100 (3.4) \n\n\n\n69\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nFinally, weight particle fractions were estimated as in Equation 3.5. \n\n \n\nF % \tF % F % F % F % \tF %\n\nF %  (3.5) \n\n \n\n3.3.2.2. Bulk density, particle density, and porosity \n\nCompost bulk density was measured by adding 1.6 liters of air-dried compost into a 2.0 \n\nliters graduated volume cylinder (0.05 m height and 0.20 m diameter). The container was \n\nfilled with bedding compost material, and then the material was slightly compacted to \n\nensure absence of large void spaces and, then the material was vibrated using a vibrating \n\nJigsaw (Black &amp; Deck, Model JS515, MD, USA) for 30 seconds (Figure 3.12). The bulk \n\ndensity can be calculated by dividing the weight of the material by the compost filled \n\nvolume of the cylinder (Ahn et al., 2009; Sales, 2008).  \n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.12 - Cylinder with compost bulking material vibrating. \n\n \nCompost particle density was determined by pouring 20 g of as-received compost into \n\nfive graduated cylinders and adding a portion of 0.10 liter of methanol (90%) to each \n\ncylinder up to fill to the 0.10 liter mark (Figure 3.13). The remaining unused methanol \n\nvolume represented the volume of particles in the compost filled cylinder (Sales, 2008). \n\n \n\n\n\n70\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nFigure 3.13 - The methanol and other equipments used to determinate particle density. \n\n \nPorosity was determined for each collected CBP bedding compost from the results of \n\nbulk and particle density by using Equation 3.6: \n\n \n\nb\n\np\n\n?\n? = 1 - \n\n?\n\n? ?\n? ?? ?\n? ?\n\n (3.6) \n\n \nwhere: ? is the overall porosity (%), ?b is the bulk density (g cm\n\n-3) and ?p is the particle \n\ndensity (g cm-3). \n\n \n3.3.2.3. Water holding capacity (WHC)  \n\nThe WHC was determined using 30 grams of the as-received compost that was \n\nsaturated with deionized water in a beaker, stirred for 3 minutes and left to rest for 7 \n\nminutes to absorb water. Saturated compost was poured into three Buchner funnels on top \n\nof Erlenmeyer flasks to drain excess water (Whatman #41 filter paper), covered with \n\nparafilm, and taken to an environmental chamber at 25\u00baC and 58% RH, where they drained \n\nfor 12 hours (Figure 3.14). Drained compost was weighed (Wi) and dried (Ws) in a \n\nconvection oven for 24 hours at 105\u00baC. The water holding capacity (g water/g dry material) \n\nis calculated as (Ahn et al., 2009): \n\n \n\n? ?? ?\n? ?? ?\ni s i\n\ni i\n\nW -W +MC M\nWHC = \n\n1-MC W\n\n?\n\n?\n (3.7) \n\n \nwhere: MC  is the initial moisture content of sample and M is the mass of the wet sample. \n\n\n\n71\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n(a) (b) (c) \nFigure 3.14 - As-received compost saturated with deionized water (a), environmental \n\nchamber (b) controlled for temperature and relative humidity and (c) \ninterior of the unit with the six compost samples. \n\n \n\n3.3.3. Thermal property measurement \n\nThermal properties were determined with transient heat dissipation device (KD2, \n\nDecagon, Pullman, WA, USA). The thermal properties, thermal conductivity (k, W/m K) \n\nand thermal resistivity (rho, \u00b0C cm/W), were measured for varying particle size ranges \n\n(0.00mm &lt;Finer &lt;2.00mm &lt;PS2 &lt;4.75 mm &lt;PS3 &lt;5.60 mm &lt;PS4 &lt;8.00 mm &lt;\n\nCoarser &lt;25.00 mm), water content (30, 45 and 60%), and different static (fluffy material, \n\n0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 MPa) and dynamic compaction degree (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 \n\nMPa). \n\nThe thermal properties was measured using a handheld device. It consists of a \n\nhandheld controller and sensors made from thin-wall stainless steel tubing with 2.4 mm \n\ndiameter x 100 mm long (see KD2 Pro\u00ae Operator`s manual, 2008). This probe was \n\ninserted into the bedding compost medium.  \n\nFirst, thermal conductivity and thermal resistivity were measured for all samples in \n\ndifferent particle size ranges (0.00mm &lt;Finer &lt;2.00mm &lt;PS2 &lt;4.75 mm &lt;PS3 &lt;5.60 \n\nmm &lt;PS4 &lt;8.00 mm &lt;Coarser &lt;25.00 mm), as described earlier (Figure 3.15). \n\nWet sample of compost bulking material with different moisture content (30%, 45% \n\nand 60%) was produced in a concrete mixer that mixed the bedding material with the added \n\nwater for 3 minutes (Figure 3.16a).\u00a0 The desired moisture contents (30%, 45%, and 60% \n\nw.b.) was achieved by adding a known water amount for each particle size range\u2019s initial \n\nmoisture contents (Table 3.1). If the initial moisture contents was higher than the selected \n\nMC, a 50 g of compost was weighed and left to air dry until reaching the target MC.  \n\n \n\n\n\n72\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nFigure 3.15 - Thermal properties sensor used to determinate the thermal conductivity and \nthermal resistivity in different particle size. \n\n \n\nTable 3.1 - Amount of water added to each particle size range to reach 30%, 45%, and 60% \n(w. b.) moisture contents.

The PVC cylinder was then \n\nvibrated using vibrating Jigsaw (Black &amp; Deck, Model JS515, MD, USA) for 60 seconds \n\nand resulting volumes were measured (Figure 3.16b).  \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 3.16 - Concrete mixer (a) used to mix the compost bulking material and (b) PVC \n\ncylinder vibrated by a vibrating Jigsaw. \n\n\n\n74\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nFor study of different degrees of compaction, a mechanical pressing device was \n\ndesigned and constructed at the shop of the Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering at \n\nDepartment of the University of Kentucky. The press device was assembled and located in \n\nthe Agricultural Air Quality Laboratory of the same Department (Figure 3.17). \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 3.17 - Mechanical pressing device designed (a) and (b) constructed to provide \n\ndifferent degrees of static and dynamic compaction. \n \n\nMaterial compaction was achieved by a mechanical pressing device that was \n\ndeveloped to pack the sample down in the PVC container. The PVC cylinder had 0.27 m \n\nheight and diameter of 0.15 m. This PVC cylinder had a series of three equally spaced \n\n(0.075, 0.150, and 0.225 m) holes through the entire height. Pipe flange was used to hold \n\nthe PVC cylinder on the base frame assembly using knurled hold down knobs (see \n\nAppendix C - Figure 1). The compaction level inside of a PVC cylinder was adjusted using \n\na valve and manometer that controlled the air pressure inside of steel cylinder chamber that \n\nmoved the steel piston (Figure 3.18). A Moisture drain valve prevented water condensation \n\nin the line of air pressure. The pressures applied (0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 MPa) were \n\nbased on studies conducted by van der Tol et al. (2003) and van der Tol et al. (2002). \n\nThe Decagon KD2-Pro (Decagon Devices Inc.) was used to evaluate the thermal \n\nproperties (thermal conductivity and thermal resistivity) associated with type pressure \n\napplied (static and dynamic pressure). This sensor uses a metal probe (0.0024 m diameter x \n\n0.100 m long) that heats up the material and then reads the temperature decay as the \n\nmaterial dissipates the heat to calculate its thermal properties. The probe was used with the \n\nentire length of the needle embedded inside the compost. Measurements were made by \n\n\n\n75\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nplacing the sensor probe into the three holes over cylinder and recording the measurement \n\nafter one minute, which was the recommended procedure for this sensor. Dynamic pressure \n\nwas applied when varying the opening and closing the air in the valve control (Figure \n\n3.18b), during 12 times per minute. This range of moisture content (30%, 45%, and 60%) \n\nwas selected to simulate the conditions of the bedded compost found in the field. The \n\nDecagon KD2-Pro sensor was calibrated by factory and performance verification standards \n\nwere observed during this study. \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 3.18 - Valve and manometer (a) and (b) mechanical pressing device components \n\nused to compress the bedding compost samples. \n \n\n \n3.3.4. Chemical properties of the compost bedding material \n\nEach compost barn pack was subdivided in three equal areas within each of the nine \n\nspots (Figure 3.5) from which 0.4 liters bedding sample were collected during the visiting. \n\nThe bedding samples were collected from the surface and kept cooled upon collection at \n\n0\u00b0C till it was placed in a -40\u00b0C freezer and held for chemical analyses. Sub-samples were \n\nground as-is before analysis for Carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), \n\ncalcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), and iron (Fe). \n\nThe analysis was performed at the Division of Regulatory Services at the University of \n\nKentucky. The solid compost was dried in an oven at 75\u00b0C for 24 hours, ground to pass a 2 \n\nmm screen, and stored at room temperature prior to analysis. Nitrogen (%) and Carbon (%) \n\nwere determined via combustion. Macro nutrients (P, K, Ca, Mg) and micro nutrients (Zn, \n\nValve \nManometer \n\nMoisture drain valve\n\nValve of control \n\nManometer \n\nPVC tube \n\nSecurity \nbutton \n\n\n\n76\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nCu, Mn, and Fe) were extracted by digestion using a combination of HCl and H2SO4 acids. \n\nThe digestate was assayed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectrometer for concentration \n\ndetermination. The P, K, Ca, Mg and Zn are reported in a weight percent basis and Zn, Cu, \n\nand Fe in ppm.  \n\nThe following section summarizes information collected by a collaborator (Black, \n\n2012). It is included to give a more details about chemical analysis. \n\n \n\n3.3.5. Bedding bacterial of the compost bedding material \n\nCompost samples were collected from nine equally spaced locations throughout the \n\nbarn described previously (Figure 3.5). Half of a cup was collected from each location, \n\nthoroughly mixed together, and stored in a -57\u00b0C freezer to later be thawed for analysis of \n\nbacterial content. The samples were sent to three different laboratories for analysis. \n\nUniversity of Kentucky in Laboratory of Soil analyzed the CBP bedding and fresh bedding \n\nmaterial for the following pathogens on a wet weight basis: Coliform, E. Coli, \n\nStaphylococcal species, Streptococcal species, and Bacillus. \n\nThe samples were thawed in a refrigerator. Fifty cubic centimeters (cc) of bedding \n\nmaterial was measured using a sterile placed into a plastic bag (Ziploc\u00ae, Johnson &amp; Son, \n\nRacine, WI, USA). Two?hundred fifty cc of sterile distilled water was added to the bedding \n\nmaterial which was mixed and allowed to stand for 10 minutes. The sample was mixed \n\nagain, a liquid sample was removed by pipette and serial 10?fold dilutions were made in \n\nsterile Brain Heart Infusion broth. Sample dilutions were plated (200 ?L) on colistin \n\nnaladixic acid (CNA) agar (BBL, Sparks, Md.), MacConkey agar (BBL, Sparks, Md.), and \n\nthallium sulfate?crystal violet?B toxin blood (TKT) agar medium. Colony counts were \n\ndetermined for each sample after 24 hours of incubation at 37\u00b0C. Bacterial groups were \n\nidentified as coliforms (lactose?positive colonies on MacConkey's agar, which include \n\nKlebsiella by visual identification), streptococcus species (growth on TKT agar), Bacillus \n\nspecies (growth on CNA agar and gram?positive) and coagulase negative staphylococci \n\n(growth on the CNA agar and catalase activity). Bacteria counts are expressed as colony \n\nforming units (cfu) / mL of bedding sample. \n\nThe following section summarizes information collected by a collaborator (Black, \n\n2012). It is included to give a more details about bacterial analysis. \n\n \n\n\n\n77\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n3.4. Study of natural ventilation in reduced model of CBP barn \n\n3.4.1. Wind tunnel \n\nA wind tunnel was built to evaluate the effect of air flow through reduced structure \n\nmodel (1:16) of CBP barn with alternate ridge designs. The purpose of this wind tunnel \n\nwas to provide a uniform and controllable air flow in the test section that passes over this \n\nreduced model. This wind tunnel was composed of an air intake, flow straightening section, \n\ntest section, and fan section. All studies were carried out in the wind tunnel of Biosystems \n\nand Agricultural Engineering at Department of the University of Kentucky.  \n\nThe wind tunnel was a low speed open circuit type with dimensions of 3.25 m wide, \n\n8.85 m length, and a height of 3.15 m (Figure 3.19). The internal dimensions were 3.15 m x \n\n8.75 m x 3.05 m comprising a total volume of 84.0 m3. Concrete blocks were used on the \n\nbase of the wind tunnel. Two by six wood boards were used to build the framing and sheets \n\nof plywood were installed  on the internal side of the framing members on the top, bottom \n\nand both of side walls. Two metal doors were used for access to internal sections of the \n\nwind tunnel.  \n\n \nFigure 3.19 - Wind tunnel 3D model design is showing placements of (a) windows, (b) \n\ndoors, (c) dampers, and (d) concrete blocks. \n \nThe axial fan diameter was approximately 1.22 m and was capable of producing 2.33 \n\nm3 s-1 of airflow at a maximum 380 rpm and against a 10.0 Pa pressure increase. The fan \n\nsection can be easily altered to accommodate smaller fan sizes. Given the 9.60 m2 \n\ncross?section of the wind tunnel, this allows for a maximum mean wind speed of 2.0 m s?1. \n\nThe fan had three cambered blades, also made from sheet metal, and full power \n\nrequirement for fan operation was 0.746 kW (1.0 hp). The fan was set in a custom welded \n\na \n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\n\n\n78\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nsteel frame that was mounted on a fiber glass box. This fiber glass box was attached to a \n\nsheet of plywood. Thereafter sixteen metallic clamps pressure were used to hold whole \n\nstructure (fan and fiber glass box) in the end wall (Figure 3.20). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.20 - View of the fan mounted on the wind tunnel. \n\n \nThis wind tunnel was equipped with four metal dampers (1.52 m x 1.52 m) to control \n\nthe wind speed. The dampers were assembled at air intake of the wind tunnel and were \n\ncontrolled by a handle on the outside. The room controls were located adjacent to the test \n\nsection. The dampers were made with stainless steel and were fitted with actuators which \n\nhas a rotation speed of 15s for 0 - 90 degree pivot. \n\nTurbulence in test section was dampened by the installation of a plastic honeycomb \n\nplates. This honeycomb plate was placed at 1.77 m down flow from the dampers to \n\npromote a laminar flow of air. For optimum benefit, the length of honeycomb was 6 times \n\nof the diameter of the hole (Rae and Pope, 1984). The honeycombs were supported by \n\nmetal frame. This frame was made from aluminum channel  to hold and seal the edges of \n\nthe honeycomb. The channels were secured to one another with rivets. The honeycombs \n\nslid snuggly into the settling chamber and were attached to the walls on each side.  \n\nThis wind tunnel had two clear viewing windows (test section) with different sizes . \n\nThese windows were covered by 2.40 x 1.20 m and 1.10 x 1.20 m, respectively, of \n\nPlexiglas with 0.003 m thickness. Those windows were placed at 3.60 m and 6.65 m, \n\nrespectively, from the upwind edge of the window. The Plexiglas windows were secured in \n\nthe wind tunnel with screws and silicone to seal and to prevent air infiltration. Care was \n\ntaken to drill holes through the Plexiglas for the screws to prevent cracking. Smoke was \n\nused to attempted to fix air infiltration problems which arose. The length of the test section \n\n\n\n79\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nwas chosen to be around 2.0 m to be able to get a high enough Reynolds number  (Re &lt;\n\n2100) on a flat plate for anticipated wind tunnel uses. \n\nSmoke was used primarily for flow visualization and photographs and videos were the \n\nprimary method of data recording. Airflow patterns were visualized using a fog machine \n\n(power 1190 W, Rosco\u00ae, model 1700,  CT, USA) which vaporized Glycerin for a smoke \n\nsource. The smoke tracer was introduced from the generator with a funnel on an end of a \n\nduct and allowed to entrain smoke with the air using the negative pressure of the wind \n\ntunnel as draw. Three light boxes, with 300 W incandescent lamps, focused light at three \n\ndifferent points along the length of the wind tunnel. The bright light combined with the \n\nblack inner surfaces allowed for photographing of air movement by both camera and \n\ncamcorder. \n\nAirflow patterns were assessed using both air flow visualization and by measuring the \n\nairspeed along the length of the test section. Airflow visualization allowed for a qualitative \n\nimage of the airflow patterns. \n\nThe final step in constructing of wind tunnel was sealing air leaks using foam sealant. \n\nFigure 3.21 illustrates the metal dampers, plastic honeycombs, and fog machine used in the \n\nwind tunnel. \n\nFurther information regarding constructions and calibration of the wind tunnel and \n\nothers details used in this study can be seen in Lopes (2012). \n\n \n\n \n(a) (b) (c) \n\nFigure 3.21 - Details of (a) metal dampers, (b) plastic honeycombs, and (c) fog machine. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n80\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n3.5. Reduced model \n\n3.5.1. Determination of pertinent variables \n\nAirflow through the roof ridge opening of a building acts essentially as fluid flow \n\nthrough an orifice. The flow is governed by viscous forces, inertia forces, gravitational \n\nforces, buoyancy forces and geometric relationships. Heat transfer from the buildings is \n\ncontrolled by fluid flow, fluid properties and building geometry and characteristics. \n\nAssuming that the same phenomenon governs performance in the reduced model, a list of \n\npertinent variables affecting the ventilation characteristics were compiled (Table 3.2) and \n\nreduced to the basic dimensions of length (L), mass (M), temperature (?), and time (T). The \n\nselection of pertinent variables was based on the assumptions that fluid flow is \n\nincompressible, the building atmosphere will be without manure gases and added moisture, \n\nand there will be significant internal heat source present (heat of compost pack). \n\n \n\nTable 3.2 - Variables affecting ventilation characteristics. \n\nVariable n?

The relationship among the pi terms for fluid flow and heat transfer can be \n\nexpressed as: \n\n\n\n81\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nTable 3.3 - List of pi terms. \n\nTerm n\u00ba Pi term \n1 ? w ? l  \n2 ? h ? l  \n3 ? g ? l ? ?  \n4 ? v ?

Those equations are valid if the criteria of the design and operation conditions \n\nare acceptable, as showing in Appendix D, according Murphy (1950). \n\nThe design conditions (Table 3.3) must be met if the reduced model is to accurately \n\npredict conditions quantitatively in prototypes. Design conditions 1 through 5 require the \n\nmodel geometric dimensions to be 1 : n (n = 16, the geometric length scale) times the \n\nprototype geometric dimensions. Design condition 6 through 10 establishes the ratio of \n\nprototype wind velocity to model wind velocity. Using the same fluid in both the reduced \n\nmodel and prototype systems requires the model wind velocity to be n times the prototype \n\nwind velocity. Details about design conditions can be seen in Appendix D. \n\nThe tests were performed with the airflow in the reduced model geometrically and \n\ndynamically similar to a full-scale CBP barn. To ensure that similarity of the characteristics \n\n\n\n83\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nof the air flow in the reduced model and real scale CBP barn, the flow regime, expressed \n\nby the Reynolds number must be equal in both cases.

More details in Appendix D. \n\n \n3.5.2. Reduced model procedure \n\nOne of the conditions of scaling is geometric uniformity which requires that all \n\ndimensions of the real object should be equally scaled. In this study all dimensions of the \n\nCBP barn were proportionally reduced with exception of the thickness of the roof. \n\nReducing the thickness of the roof would result in a deformation in the shape of the roof \n\nand hence would change the speed and behavior of the airflow. \n\nThe scale of the model depends on: \n\na) The height and width of the test section in the wind tunnel. A model that is too large \n\ncould block the airflow in the tunnel and would be subject to wall effects.  \n\nb) The thickness of the boundary layer. Thereby under natural conditions the CBP barn \n\nis situated in the boundary layer, the reduced model should also be placed in the boundary \n\nlayer in the wind tunnel.  \n\n \n3.5.2.1. Experimental reduced model \n\nA reduced model was constructed in accordance with the design conditions and has a \n\ngeometric length scale of 16 for testing. The five ridge vents studies (Appendix E - Figure \n\n1) were constructed with a 0.057 m ridge outlet corresponding to a 0.913 m opening in the \n\nprototype. The four wind directions investigated (North, South, East, and West) were to \n\nrepresent wind directions found in the field by rotating the model in the wind tunnel. \n\n\n\n84\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThe reduced model was built using balsa wood and wood glue was used to join pieces. \n\nTwo aluminum plates were used as the roof cover this model. This reduced model had an \n\noverall width of 1.20 m, length of 1.33 m, high at the ridge of 0.50 m, and the slope of the \n\nroof was 4:12, so that the scale factor is 1:16. The reduced model is a copy of a CBP barn \n\n24 (Appendix B - Figures 43 and 44) with 36 dairy cows situated in Kentucky (USA). The \n\nventilation openings in the reduced model consisted of a 1.20 m wide ridge opening and \n\neave openings of 0.30 m in height. The top of front wall and end wall under the gable were \n\nmade of Plexiglas to accommodate airflow visualization. This reduced model was built on \n\na wood table equipped with four wheels. The table has an opening of 0.93 m x 1.33 m and \n\naluminum perforated plate was used to covered this opening. This opening was occupying \n\n80.9% of the floor area that represent the compost pack area. Figure 3.22 is showing the 3D \n\nmodel design used in this study. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.22 - 3D model design used in this study. Dimensions in meters (m). \n\n \n3.5.2.2. Heating system \n\nEighteen incandescent lights of 40 W each were installed as electrical heaters under the \n\nperforated plate to simulate the sensible heat of microbial activity in the compost bedding. \n\nThe maximum power flux was ? 560 W m-2 and was controlled by dimmer varying the \n\nintensity of the lights. Thus, it was varied to maintain the floor (compost area) at 45\u00b0C. The \n\nreduced model floor was maintained at a constant temperature to simulate the heat gains \n\nfrom the compost bedding in the occupied zone.  \n\nAn insulated box was built below and around the sides of the opening to promote the \n\nheat transmission only through the perforated plate. The perforated plate was cover with \n\n\n\n85\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\naluminum sheet and 2.5 kg of sawdust was spread out over the surface. The heating system \n\nand the reduced model with perforated plate, that was used in this study, see Figure 3.23.  \n\n \n\n \n(a) \n\n \n(b) \n\nFigure 3.23 - The heating system (a) and (b) reduced model without roof used in this study. \n\n \n3.5.2.3. Static pressure, airspeed and temperature measurements \n\nStatic pressure was read using two hoses connected with the static pressure sensor \n\n(Setra Systems Model 265, series 0811) shown in Figure 3.24, which measure static \n\npressure from 0 to 62 Pa, with an advertized accuracy of 1%. One hose goes inside the \n\nwind tunnel, while the other goes outside the wind tunnel. In this way, the sensor could \n\nprovide the difference in pressures from outside and inside the wind tunnel during the tests. \n\nThe tests were run with the static pressure range 0 to 10 Pa. \n\nDimmer\n\nLights\u00a0\nInsulated box\u00a0\n\nPerforated plate\u00a0\n\n\n\n86\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 3.24 - Static pressure sensor (a) and (b) hoses on the sensor for static pressure \n\nmeasurement. \n \n\nAirspeed and air temperature were measured using two hot?wire anemometer (accuracy \n\nof \u00b10.01 m/s; Testo\u00ae, model 425, Sparta, NJ, USA). One sensor was placed at the \n\nbeginning of the working section at 1.00 m height above the floor of the wind tunnel and \n\nanother sensor was placed inside the reduced model using a non-uniform measured grid. \n\nThis non-uniform grid ranged from 0.10 m to 1.20 m horizontally at 0.55 m intervals and \n\nfrom the floor to ceiling vertically ranged from 0.02 m to 0.20 m at 0.09 m intervals. The \n\nlocations of the measurement positions used in the experimental analysis are illustrated in \n\nFigure 3.25. The hot-wire anemometer inside the building was mounted on a frame, which \n\nallowed the anemometer to be manually moved to each measurement position (see Figure \n\n3.25) once measurements at each location were complete. The values measured were \n\nreplicated three times. The sampling period was fixed at 10 minutes per collection point. \n\nThe experiments were carried out with two reference airspeeds: 0.1 m s\u20131 (low wind \n\nspeed) and 1.0 m s\u20131 (high wind speed). Those airspeeds were selected based on the tunnel \n\ncapacity and the wall opening area of the reduced model in order to achieve the desired \n\nReynolds numbers (Re &lt;2100) for laminar airflow around and through the model. \n\n \n\nStatic\u00a0pressure\u00a0sensor\u00a0\n\n\n\n87\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nFigure 3.25 - The plan and elevation showing the distribution of measurement points \nthroughout the reduced model. \n\n \n\n3.6. The CFD model \n\n3.6.1. CFD representation of the reduced model geometry \n\nIn order to validate the CFD model, a 3D Rhinoceros\u00ae design of the experimental \n\nreduced model was developed and imported into the CFD package. The dimensions of the \n\ncomputational model were: length (Y direction) 1.35 m, width (X direction) 1.20 m, eave \n\nheight (Z direction) 0.27 m, and the ridge height 0.48 m. The computational model had a \n\ntotal volume of 0.64 m3. With 78.1% of the total compost pack space provided for animal \n\noccupation and bearing in mind the minimum specification for dairy cows housing at 9.3 \n\nm2/cow (Barberg et al., 2007; Janni et al., 2007). The effect of confined dairy cows on \n\nairflow was not considered in this CFD model. \n\nIn this study, five different ridge vents were built, subdivided into: (a) Closed ridge - \n\nCLR, (b) Open ridge - OPR, (c) Open ridge with chimney - ORC, (d) Elevated ridge - \n\n\n\n88\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nELR, and (e) Overshot ridge - OVR. The dimensions of the ridge opening were 1.35 m in \n\nlength and 0.057 m wide. The eave openings were also 1.35 m in length and were 0.23 m in \n\nheight (0.31 m2). The total compost pack surface area of the building was 0.877 m2 and \n\ntotal area of the side wall openings was 0.077 m2. The modifications in ridge vents were \n\nadjusted in simulations that examined the influence of different types of the ridge design on \n\nthe ventilation performance. \n\nThe measured values obtained experimentally for an open reduced model of CBP barn \n\nand subjected to natural ventilation were used to assign the boundary conditions of the \n\nmodel (Figure 3.26 and Table 3.4). Two cases (shown in Table 3.4) were tested using four \n\nbuilding orientation (North, South, West, and East). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.26 - Diagram of the modeled and simulated reduced model of CBP barn. \n\n \n\nTable 3.4 \u2013 Boundary conditions utilized in the CFD model \n\nCase Location Boundary condition Value \n\n1 \nInlet \n\nAverage air speed 0.1 m s-1 \nAir temperature 22.0\u00a0\u00b0C \n\nOutlet Atmospheric pressure 0.0 Pa \nFloor Temperature of  surface compost 45.0\u00a0\u00b0C \n\n2 \nInlet \n\nAverage air speed 1.0 m s-1 \nAir temperature 22.0\u00a0\u00b0C \n\nOutlet Atmospheric pressure 0.0 Pa \nFloor Temperature of  surface compost 45.0\u00a0\u00b0C \n\n \n\n\n\n89\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n3.6.2. Computational modeling \n\nTo improve the CFD accuracy, the study exerted much effort to find the appropriate \n\nmesh quality and density, and optimum setting condition of wind velocity.\u00a0 The mesh \n\nquality is very important to get accurate data and computational convergence. Thus, due to \n\nthe geometric complexity of the reduced model of CBP barn, it was opted to utilize the \n\nANSYS ICEM CFD\u00ae software for construction of a tetrahedral computational mesh which \n\nallows for obtaining results with fewer errors (Lee et al., 2007). This software has been \n\nspecifically designed to fulfill the task of automatically generating high quality tetrahedral \n\nmeshes, which are suitable for scientific computing using numerical methods such as finite \n\nvolume methods.  \n\nThe tetrahedral volume element is very useful to maintain the high quality of the mesh \n\nto a region using different forms of complex geometry to be modeled in the region of \n\ninterest. But, it requires more nodes than the mesh elements and results in a hexametrical \n\nfile size and computational time increased (Lee et al., 2007; Katz and Sankaran, 2011). \n\nWhen the reduced model and CFD computed results were compared with each other, \n\nthe reduced model and CFD computed airflow distribution at a cross-section plane of the \n\nreduced model were mainly comparable with each other.  \n\n \n3.6.3. Boundary conditions \n\nThe results obtained by simulation using CFD were compared with the corresponding \n\ndata obtained experimentally in the wind tunnel. In this study, the CFD boundary condition \n\nwas specified as the same as the wind tunnel boundary condition of test section. \n\nThe measured values obtained experimentally in the wind tunnel were used to assign \n\nthe boundary conditions of the model. Thus, it is necessary to provide the initial values of \n\nvariables such as air temperature and velocity, calculate the terms of air temperature and \n\nvelocity for each condition and solve the equations of conservation of energy, mass and \n\nmomentum \n\nAir flow rates are associated with turbulent flows and, combined with heat transfer \n\nrates, generate a complex system of coupled equations difficult to resolve. Therefore, the \n\nCFD technique was utilized to solve the average Navier-Stokes and energy equations, \n\ndetermining velocity, temperature and pressure by the finite volumes technique. The model \n\nfor non-isothermal fluid flow is described by equation of mass, continuity, energy and \n\nspecies, simplified as follows (Kin et al., 2008). \n\n\n\n90\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n? ?U 0  (3.21) \n\n \n\n? ?U 0  (3.22) \n\n \n\n? ?UU p ?

The ANSYS CFX\u00ae software belongs to the Department of Agricultural \n\nand Environmental Engineering of the Federal University of Vi\u00e7osa, and was employed to \n\nprogram and simulate the proposed method. The following considerations were assumed: \n\n(a) steady state, (b) incompressible flow, and (c) turbulent flow. \n\nTwo computational meshes were generated with different refinement levels using the \n\nCFX Mesh computational program, with the objective of verifying effect of refinement on \n\nlocal concentration gradients at the spatial levels. \n\n \n3.6.4. Statistical analysis methods \n\na) Barns measurements, compost management practices, and herd characteristics \n\nDescriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles) \n\nwere used to describe individual barn measurements, compost management practices, and \n\nherd characteristics (Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA). \n\n \n \n\n\n\n91\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nb) WHC, moisture content and bacterial analysis of composts \n\nThe data were statistically analysed using Analysis of Variance and Correlation by \n\nusing computer software SigmaPlot\u00ae, version 11.0, Systat Software\u00ae, Inc (Wass, 2009) on \n\na Personal Computer. \n\n \nc) Thermal properties as a function of particle size, moisture content, and compaction \n\ndegree \n\nStatistical calculations were performed using Sisvar 4.6 (Ferreira, 2003) which is \n\ndeveloped by the Federal University of Lavras, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Average values for \n\nthermal properties in each particle size, moisture content, and compaction degree ranges \n\nwere generally used for statistical analyses by ANOVA. For each ANOVA, a particle size, \n\nmoisture content, and compaction degree ranges consisted of a treatment.

Introduction \n\nResults are presented in four main sections: \n\na) Characterization and description of CBP barns (section 4.2): building layout and \n\ndimensions, bedding pack characteristic, manure management practices, environmental \n\ncharacteristics, cow characteristics, and producers responses; \n\nb) Evaluate and determine the physical, bacterial, chemical, and thermal properties of \n\ncompost bulking materials (section 4.3): compost particle size distribution, particle density, \n\nbulk density, porosity, water holding capacity, chemical properties of composts, bacterial \n\nanalysis of composts, and thermal properties of composts; \n\nc) Development of predictive equations for thermal properties of compost as a function \n\nof various combinations of moisture content, pressure, and particle size (section 4.3): \n\nd) Develop computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of compost barn with alternate \nridge designs and visually demonstrate impact on air flow through structure (section 4.4): \n\n \n\n4.2. Characterization and description of CBP barns \n\n4.2.1. Barn structure and layout \n\nThe compost dairy barn measurement and layout information collected included: barn \n\nand pack dimensions, feed alley dimensions, waterer location and size, fan and light \n\ndescription, stock density, sidewall height, as well as other barn specifications. General \n\nbarn characteristics for 42 CBP in Kentucky are shown in Appendix A (Table A.1).  \n\nType and orientation of ridge, roof structure and type, roof pitch are showing in \n\nAppendix A (Table A.2). \n\nVentilation system, cooling fan number, power, size, number of luminaries, and \n\nillumination type are listed in Appendix A (Table A.3). \n\nIn general, the first CBP barn was constructed in Kentucky in 2002 and the CBP barn \n\nnumber has increased to 58 by the end of 2010. The type of barn construction varied, \n\nincluding barn dimensions, type of ridge, ridge orientation, ventilation system, etc.  \n\nCBP barns are a low capital-cost alternative to freestall barns. However, the lower \n\ninitial investment for bedded-pack barns may be offset by higher annual operating costs. \n\n\n\n93\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nBarn building costs ranged from $8.000,00 to $400.000,00. Barberg et al. (2007) reported \n\nthat the building costs ranged widely depending on the amount of on-farm labor utilized \n\nand amenities added.  \n\nBarn ventilation rates are influenced building dimensions, orientation of ridge, sidewall \n\nopening, eave opening, ridge opening, and wind speed. The average compost bedding pack \n\nbarn dimensions and were 49.1 m (length) and 21.9 m (width). The most frequent barn \n\nlength was between 25 to 50 m (45.2%), 33.3% was between 50 to 75 m, 11.9% was higher \n\nthan 75 m, and 9.5% was less than 15 m. The most of frequent barn width was between 15 \n\nto 30 m (61.9%), 19.0% was less than 15 m, 16.7% was 30 to 45 m, 2.4% was higher than \n\n75 m. The majority of compost bedded pack barn had areas between 500 to 1000 m \n\n(33.3%). The frequency distribution of compost bedding pack barn area is illustrated in \n\nFigure 4.1. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 - The frequency distribution of compost bedding pack barns area. \n\n \nMajority of these barns had feed alleys and driveways. Only 26.2% of the barns, the \n\ncows had free access to pasture, 9.5% was equipped with cow brush. A feed store and \n\nanaerobic lagoon was present around these barns in 52.3%. Headlocks was found in 19% of \n\nthe CBP barns. \n\n\n\n94\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nCow water intake has a critical effect on her milk productivity and reproductive \n\nperformance since it regulates dry matter intake. A cow must have access to water when \n\nneeded to satisfy this need. Only 19.0% meet recommendations of 0.10 to 0.15 m per cow \n\n(McFarland et al., 2007). In addition, cows did not have access to water at the barn in 24% \n\nof the compost bedded pack barns. Cows in over 76.0% of the barns were critically short of \n\nwaterer space which would limit their milk production. \n\nThe recommended feedbunk (stock density) space per cow is 0.03 to 0.06 m / cow \n\n(Smith and Harner, 2001). It was found that 29% of the compost bedded pack barns met \n\nthis recommendation with an additional 12% exceeding it. Only 31% of the compost \n\nbedded pack barns had no feedbunks, although most of these had concrete alleyways \n\nleading to nearby feedbunks. Inadequate bunk space was found at 25% of the compost \n\nbedded pack barns. Overstocking at the feed bunk increases competition among cows and \n\nmay limit milk production. \n\nBarn orientation will determine the intensity of solar radiation falling on the walls, \n\nbedded and feed alley, and roof of the building. Barns oriented are generally an E-W \n\norientation in Kentucky, though the recommended orientation is site-specific based upon \n\nnatural wind flows. The typical prevailing winds in Kentucky come from the SW in the \n\nsummer and from the NW in the winter which would suggest the East-West ridge \n\norientation as the most effective. The frequency distribution of ridge orientation is listed in \n\nFigure 4.2. Results show that the most frequent orientation is NE-SW (50.0%) with the \n\nnext highest being NW-SE (45.2%). \n\nThe vertical separation between the eave and ridge openings has a significant impact on \n\nthe pressure differences generated by the chimney effect (Chastain, 2000). Therefore, the \n\nroof slope is an important consideration in the design of a naturally ventilated building. All \n\nbarns with a gable design are best ventilated with a roof pitch of 3:12 or 4:12 (Smith and \n\nHarner, 2001). There are 42 measurements since 2 barns were found to have different \n\npitches on each side of the ridge and 2 barns were using hoop structure. Most of barns had \n\nroof pitch of 4:12 (54.8%) and 14.3% had roof pitch of 3:12. Barns with roof pitches higher \n\nthan 4:12 or lower than 3:12 (MWPS-7, 2000), can limit the natural ventilation rate per \n\ncow. \n\n \n\n\n\n95\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 - Frequency distribution of ridge orientation. \n\n \nSidewall opening height and eave height are provided to protect the cows from sun, \n\nrain, and wind, thus helping to maintain proper ventilation and animal comfort. A 3.5m \n\nsidewall opening is recommended for barns less than 12.2 m wide while a 4.2 m opening \n\nheight is recommended for barns wider than 12.2 m (Graves and Brugger, 1994). \n\nFrequency distribution of sidewall opening height and eave height for the barns in this \n\nstudy are presented in Figure 4.3. Results show that the most frequent sidewall height is \n\nbetween 2.0 to 4.0 m (66.7%). In 66.7% of barns, the eave height had more than 4.0 m. \n\nSome of these barns had low walls on outside perimeter to contain the compost and would \n\nreduce the effectiveness of the measured eave height. \n\nA proper eave overhang minimizes the entry of sun, snow, and rain through open \n\nsidewalls. Gay (2009) recommend eave overhang with 1/3 of the sidewall height. Majority \n\nof barns (54.8%) had eave overhand less than 1.0 m. In 35.7% of barns had eave overhang \n\nbetween 1.0 m and 2.0 m and only 9.5% of barns had eave overhang with 2.0 m or more. \n\nFigure 4.4 is showing the frequency distribution of eave overhang. \n\n \n\n\n\n96\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nFigure 4.3 - Frequency distribution of sidewall opening and eave height for the barns. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4 - Frequency distribution of eave overhang in barns. \n\n \nRidge design affects air movement by removing warm/hot moist air that collects under \n\nthe roof. The design of the ridge can help or inhibit barn ventilation depending on the wind \n\nvelocity and direction relative to the ridge line. Characteristics of the CBP barn ridge are \n\nshowed in Figure 4.5. The primary types of barn ridge found in the compost bedded pack \n\nbarn study were overshot ridges (59%), open ridge with cover (19%), capped ridge (12%), \n\nopen ridge without cover (5%), and hoop structure (5%). \n\n\n\n97\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nFigure 4.5 - Frequency distribution of the CBP barn ridge in Kentucky. \n\n \nThe width of the continuous ridge opening controls air exhausting from the barn. As the \n\nwidth of a barn increases, the ridge opening should also increase. Figure 4.6 summarizes \n\nthe ratio of ridge opening to barn width on the compost bedded pack barns visited in \n\nKentucky. Figure 4.6 notes the present recommended ridge opening width of 0.07 m / 3.05 \n\nm of barn width with a minimum width requirement of 0.30 m for barns of less than 12.20 \n\nm width. There are two ridge opening values shown in Figure 4.6: a) apparent ridge \n\nopening (0.02 meters / 3.05 meters of building width) and b) effective ridge opening (0.02 \n\nmeters / 3.05 meters of building width). The apparent opening is the ridge opening width as \n\nseen from inside the barn. The effective opening is the smallest width through which air \n\nflows to the outside of the barn at the ridge. \n\nFigure 4.6 indicates the compost barn ridge measurements as a ratio of the ridge \n\nopening to barn width (meters / 3.05 meters). There were 17% of the barns with no ridge \n\nopening. Based on the apparent ridge opening, 18% had inadequate ridge opening (&lt;2.5 \n\n0.02 meters / 3.05 meters), while 17% had marginal ridge openings (2.5 to &lt;0.07 meters / \n\n3.05 meters), and 48% equaled or exceeded the recommended ridge opening. However, \n\nbased on the effective ridge opening, 53% had inadequate ridge opening, while 20% had \n\nmarginal ridge openings, and only 11% equaled or exceeded the recommended ridge \n\nopening. The large majority of barns had ridge opening restrictions that could cause \n\ninadequate natural ventilation that can significantly affect cows, particularly under heat \n\nstress conditions. \n\n\n\n98\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n(a) \n\n(b) \nFigure 4.6 - Ridge opening to barn width ratio for compost bedded pack barns: (a) \n\nApparent Ridge Opening Compost Barns - 0.02 meters / 3.05 meters width \nand (b) Effective Ridge Opening Compost Barns - 0.02 meters / 3.05 meters \nwidth. \n\n \n\nThe majority of compost bedded pack barns were equipped with box fans (42.8%) for \n\ncirculation, 30.9% using natural ventilation, 23.8% using High Volume Low Speed Fans \n\n(HVLS) for circulation, and 2.5% Tunnel ventilation (hoop structures). Buildings that will \n\nuse tunnel ventilation require more elaborate ridge openings with some type of closure \n\nsystem. In this case, it is recommended to consult a competent designer (Agricultural \n\nEngineer) who has experience with cattle shelter ventilation for special situations.\u00a0Most of \n\nHVLS fans used had diameter of 7.32 m. The average diameter of box fans was 0.98 m, \n\nranged from 0.46 m to 1.32 m. \n\n\n\n99\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nLighting in compost bedded pack barns was noted at each dairy visited. It was found \n\nthat 41% of compost bedded pack barns didn't have lights. High Intensity Discharge (HID) \n\nwas the most frequent form of light producers used. This was followed by Fluorescent \n\n(14%), Compact fluorescent (12%), and Incandescent (10%). Total lighting wattage is also \n\nnoted. The light average power used in a barn was 124 W, ranged from 13  to 192 W. \n\n \n4.2.2.

Compost bedding pack management \n\nThe highest percentage (45.2%) of barns are bedded with kiln dried wood shavings or \n\nsawdust, followed by the green sawdust (42.9%) and the blend of both materials (11.9%). \n\nFine, dry wood shavings or sawdust is the ideal material for bedding (Endres, 2009). Most \n\nof the barns in Kentucky had their compost tilled and aerated to a depth of 0.11 to 0.23 m \n\ntwice a day in the summer and winter time, while cows were at the milking parlor. The \n\nmost often used stirring tool was a chisel plow on a small tractor.   \n\nA large number of farmers cleaned out the pack entirely once a year. In this case, a load \n\nof clean material (shavings or sawdust) was added after removal of the used bedding to a \n\ndepth 0.30 m in order to start the new pack. Typically, a load of fresh material was added \n\nevery one to five weeks, varying by season, weather conditions, barn size, and cow density. \n\nSome farmers left about 0.15 m of old material in barn to help initiate microbial activity. \n\nThere were a small number of dairies adding a thin layer of fresh bedding when the bedded \n\npack became moist enough for it to stick to the cows body after they rise from lying down \n\non the bedded pack. \n\nThe average pack dimensions for the 42 compost barns we studied were 47.7 m (\u00b119.1) \n\nand 16.1 m (\u00b15.9). The average stock density in this study was 8.9 m2 per cow, ranging \n\nfrom 0.8 to 25.8 m2 per cow. The suggested minimum space per cow in these building is \n\n7.4 m2 per cow (Janni et al., 2007). According to Endres (2009), some producers in \n\nMinnesota provided 9.4 m2 per cow.  \n\nTemperatures of bedding compost tended to be lower on barns 16, 22, 23, 24, 29, 35, \n\n36, and 38 which utilized green sawdust rather than kiln dried wood shavings or sawdust \n\nfor bedding (t test, P > 0.05). The temperatures were greater in the areas of the pack that \n\nwere fluffier, that were not heavily soiled or packed by the cows. This observation is \n\nconsistent with the need for oxygen for microbial activity that promotes composting. \n\nAverage bedding moisture content in the top (20 cm) was 59.0% (\u00b1 9.0) wet basis \n\nranged from 36.2 to 71.8%. Details can be seen in Appendix A (Table A.4). Moisture \n\ncontent between 40.0% and 65.0% is generally recommended for composting most \n\nmaterials (NRAES-54, 1992). Excessive moisture addition needs to be avoided. The \n\nmoisture content can vary owing to the addition of fresh bedding, weather, and cow density \n\nin the sampling area (Barbeg et al.. 2007). More details about compost bedding pack \n\nmanagement in each barn can be seen below. \n\n\n\n130\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n4.2.3.1. Management practices in each barn \n\nBarn 1 was bedded with green sawdust (Figure 4.46a). The pack was aerated twice a \n\nday in the summer and the winter time using a chisel plow (Figure 4.46b), while the cows \n\nwere milked. The pack was aerated to a depth of 0.28 m, which is the recommended depth \n\nof 0.25 to 0.30 m (Janni et al., 2007). This barn was not cleaned out during the year, the \n\npack had dimensions of 41.5 m x 15.3 m. The stock density was 10.0 m2 per cow \n\n(Appendix A - Table A.1). \n\nThe average bedding temperatures at surface and 0.10 m and 0.20 m depths were \n\n17.1\u00b0C (\u00b11.3), 31.9\u00b0C (\u00b110.2), and 35.2\u00b0C (\u00b19.4), respectively. Paired t-test statistical \n\nanalysis indicated that the averages for the two depths were different (P &lt;0.05). Details \n\ncan be seen in Appendix A (Table A.4). \n\nThe average bedding moisture was 44.5% (\u00b18.0). The minimum bedding moisture was \n\n30.7% and the maximum was 56.7% (Appendix A - Table A.5). The first and third \n\nquartiles were 40.4% and 49.8%, respectively.  \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.46 - Green sawdust (a) and (b) chisel plow used to aeration used in barn 1. \n\n \nBarn 2 was using green sawdust to bed the pack (Figure 4.47a). This barn used a chisel \n\nplow on a small tractor (Figure 4.47b) to till the pack twice a day in the summer and the \n\nwinter time, while the cows were milked. The pack was aerated to a depth of 0.40 m. The \n\npack dimensions were 53.4 m x 30.3 m and the stock density was 9.3 m2 per cow \n\n(Appendix A - Table A.1). This barn was cleaned out once a year.  \n\nThe average of the pack temperature in the depth 0.1 m [41.5\u00b0C (\u00b110.6)] was less than \n\nthe average of the depth 0.2 m [53.4\u00b0C (\u00b14.6)], as can been see in Appendix A (Table A.4). \n\n\n\n131\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nPaired t-test statistical analysis indicated that at the 0.05 significance level, the averages for \n\nthe two depths were different. The surface pack temperature measured was 16.5\u00b0C (\u00b13.6).  \n\nThe average bedding moisture was 49.0% (\u00b17.3), ranging from 38.3% to 61.5% \n\n(Appendix A - Table A.5). The first and third quartiles were 45.7% and 52.0%, \n\nrespectively. The moisture content in the bedding compost varied upon time since last \n\naddition of fresh bedding, weather, and stock density in the sampling area. \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.47 - Green sawdust (a) and (b) the chisel plow used in barn 2. \n\n \nBarn 3 was bedded with kiln dried wood shavings or sawdust. According Changirath et \n\nal. (2011), the cows prefer lying on drier and loose bedding (Figure 4.48). The bedded pack \n\nwas stirred twice a day in the summer and winter time, while the cows were being milked. \n\nMoreover, a small tractor was pulling a chisel plow to promote the aeration. The bedding \n\ncompost was removed from this barn three a year and spread directly in the fields when \n\nnecessary. The pack area had dimensions of 87.8 m x 12.2 m and the stock density was 7.4 \n\nm2 per cow (Appendix A - Table A.1). This barn was cleaned out three times per year.  \n\nAverages bedding temperatures at surface, 0.1 m and 0.2 m depths were 16.3\u00b0C (\u00b13.8), \n\n36.2\u00b0C (\u00b19.5), and 52.1\u00b0C (\u00b14.6), respectively (Appendix A - Table A.4). Paired t-test \n\nstatistical analysis indicated that the averages for the two depths were different (P &lt;0.05).  \n\nThe average bedding moisture was 49.1% (\u00b15.8), which is the moisture content, needed \n\nfor composting (NRAES-54, 1992). The minimum and maximum bedding moisture was \n\nbetween 43.4% and 58.7%. The first and third quartiles were 46.1% and 54.1%, \n\nrespectively. Details about bedding moisture content as seen in Appendix A (Table A.5).  \n\n \n\n\n\n132\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 4.48 - Cows lying on the bedding compost of the Barn 3. \n\n \nBarn 4 was bedded with mix material (sawdust mixed with other material as available). \n\nTilling was performed once a day in the summer and winter time, using a chisel plow with \n\n0.45 m shovels (Figure 4.49a). The chisel plow tills to a depth of 0.25 m \u2013 0.38 m. This \n\nkeeps the bedded pack fairly loose, well aerated, and the surface dry. In fact, this bedded \n\npack was the driest at surface to 0.25 m depth. During cultivation water vapor was visible, \n\nindicating a higher temperature of the compost in comparison to the air (Figure 4.49b). \n\nThis barn was not cleaned out during the year. The pack dimensions were 51.5 m x 9.2 m \n\nand the stock density (5.1 m2 per cow). Details can be seen in Appendix A (Table A.1). \n\nThe average surface temperature measured was 15.5\u00b0C (\u00b13.5). The average of the pack \n\ntemperature in the depth 0.1 m and 0.2 m were 41.1\u00b0C (\u00b118.7) and 52.4\u00b0C (\u00b17.6), \n\nrespectively (Appendix A - Table A.4). Paired t-test statistical analysis indicated that these \n\ntwo averages were not different (P &lt;0.05). \n\nThe average bedding moisture was 36.2% (\u00b16.3). as can be seen in Appendix A (Table \n\nA.5). The minimum bedding moisture was 27.8% and the maximum was 44.9%. The first \n\nand third quartiles were 30.5% and 40.0%, respectively. \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.49 - Chisel plow used the bedding compost in Barn 4. \n\n\n\n133\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nBarn 5 was using kiln dried wood shavings or sawdust in the pack (Figure 4.50). This \n\nbedding material has been widely used in compost dairy barn throughout Minnesota with \n\ndifferent success (Barberg et al., 2007; Janni et al., 2007; Janni et al., 2005).  Aeration was \n\nperformed once a day in the summer time and three times a day in the winter time, using a \n\ntractor to pull a chisel plow. The pack was aerated to a depth of 0.23 m. The pack \n\ndimensions were 42.7 m x 10.7 m. This barn was cleaned out twice a year. The stock \n\ndensity (5.3 m2 per cow) was less than suggested minimum (7.4 m2 per cow) by Janni et al. \n\n(2007). Details can be seen in Appendix A (Table A.1). \n\nThe average bedding temperatures at surface and two depths (0.1 m and 0.2 m) were \n\n22.2\u00b0C (\u00b11.3), 26.0\u00b0C (\u00b16.1), and 27.2\u00b0C (\u00b16.6), respectively, as can been see in Appendix \n\nA (Table A.4). Paired t-test statistical analysis indicated that the averages for the two \n\ndepths were not different (P &lt;0.05).  \n\nThe average bedding moisture was 52.2% (\u00b15.6). The minimum bedding moisture was \n\n43.7% and the maximum was 61.7%. The first and third quartiles were 47.5% and 55.2%, \n\nrespectively. More details about moisture content of bedding see Appendix A (Table A.5). \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.50 - Barn 5 was using kiln dried wood shavings or sawdust in the pack. \n\n \nBarn 6 was bedded with kiln dried wood shavings or sawdust (Figure 4.51a). The \n\nloosest and driest compost was found in this barn with a fluffy consistency. The pack was \n\naerated once a day in the summer time and twice a day in the winter time, while the cows \n\nwere milked, using rotary tiller on a tractor (Figure 4.51b). This barn was not cleaned out. \n\nThe bedded pack had dimensions of 24.4 m x 12.2 m and the stock density was 4.0 m2 per \n\ncow.

This barn was not \n\ncleaned out a year. The pack was aerated once a day in the summer and winter time using a \n\nchisel plow (Figure 4.53). The pack was aerated to a depth of 0.25 m. The compost \n\nappeared relatively wet and did stick to the boots when walking on the surface and small \n\nlumps of bedding pack material did not smell when broken and rubbed against the palms of \n\nour hands. According Klaas et al. (2010), this process can indicate absence of anaerobic \n\nprocesses. The pack dimensions were 65.9 m x 7.9 m and the stock density was 11.0 m2 per \n\ncow. Details can be seen in Appendix A (Table A.1). \n\nAverage bedding temperatures at surface and two depths (0.1 m and 0.2 m) were \n\n17.8\u00b0C (\u00b14.1).  24.1\u00b0C (\u00b14.8), and 24.4\u00b0C (\u00b13.5), respectively (Appendix A - Table A.4). \n\nPaired t-test statistical analysis indicated that the averages for the two depths were not \n\ndifferent (P &lt;0.05).  \n\nThe average bedding moisture was 61.6% (\u00b12.5). The minimum bedding moisture was \n\n58.2% and the maximum was 65.9% (Appendix A - Table A.5).

This barn was cleaned out \n\nonce a year. The compost pack appeared to be compacted and chunks were seen after \n\nstirring. Compaction is expected to reduce aeration and microbial activity compared to the \n\nfluffy loose packs (Janni et al., 2007). The pack dimensions were 76.3 m x 18.5 m and the \n\nstock density was 13.5 m2 per cow (Appendix A - Table A.1). \n\nThe surface pack temperature measured was 22.3\u00b0C (\u00b111.7).

The \n\nbedded pack was stirred twice a day in the summer and winter time, using a chisel plow \n\n(Figure 4.55b), while the cows were being milked. The stirring mixes manure and urine on \n\nthe surface into the bedded pack to provide a fresh surface for cows to lie down on the pack \n\nafter milked (Janni et al., 2007). This barn was cleaned out twice a year. The pack \n\ndimensions were 61.0 m x 30.5 m. Approximately 184 cows were kept in the bedded pack \n\nthat provided a stock density of 10.1 m2 per cow (Appendix A - Table A.1). \n\n\n\n137\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThe averages bedding temperatures at surface and 0.1 m and 0.2 m depths were 17.3\u00b0C \n\n(\u00b15.6), 35.6\u00b0C (\u00b18.6), and 41.4\u00b0C (\u00b111.4), respectively.

The average moisture content of bedding in Barn 10 is \n\ngiven in Appendix A (Table A.5). \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.55 - Barn 10 was aerated using a chisel plow. \n\n \nBarns 11 and 12 were bedded using sawdust mixed with other material as available. \n\nThe wet compost was found in these barns, with mainly slurry consistency and did stick to \n\nthe boots when walking on the surface. The bedding materials were aerated to a depth of \n\n0.23 m, once a day in the summer and winter time while cows are being milked. A tractor \n\nwas pulling a chisel plow to promote the aeration (Figure 4.56). The bedded packs had the \n\nsame dimensions in both barns of 91.5 m x 15.3 m and the stock density were 9.3 m2 per \n\ncow (Appendix A - Table A.1). These barns were cleaned out twice a year. \n\nThe average surface temperature measured in CBP barns 11 and 12 were 15.2\u00b0C (\u00b12.5) \n\nand 18.5\u00b0C (\u00b112.5), respectively (Appendix A - Table A.4).

The compost packs were aerated twice a day in the summer and winter time, using \n\nrotary tiller (Figure 4.57b). Water vapor was visible during aeration, indicating a higher \n\ntemperature of the compost in comparison to the air. These barns were not cleaned out \n\nduring the year. These barns had the same pack dimensions of 61.0 m x 13.7 m and the \n\nsame stock density of 8.8 m2 per cow (Appendix A - Table A.1). \n\nThe average surface temperatures measured in Barns 13 and 14 were 11.7\u00b0C (\u00b15.3) and \n\n8.9\u00b0C (\u00b11.6), respectively. Details about bedding temperature can be seen in Appendix A \n\n(Table A.4). Paired t-test statistical analysis indicated that in both barns the averages \n\ntemperatures for the two depths of were not different (P &lt;0.05). \n\nThe average bedding moisture in Barn 13 was less [36.2% (\u00b16.3)] than Barn 14 [57.3% \n\n(\u00b14.3)], ranged from 50.6% to 63.4% in Barn 13 and ranged from 49.8% to 64.0% in Barn \n\n14 (Appendix A - Table A.5).  \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.57 - Rotary tiller was used to aerated the bedding compost in barns 13 and 14. \n\n \n\n\n\n139\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nBarn 15 was bedded using kiln dried wood shavings or sawdust (Figure 4.58). The \n\ncompost pack was aerated twice a day (summer and winter time), using chisel plow. The \n\nbedding materials were aerated to a depth of 0.18 m. The bedding compost was cleaned out \n\nonce a year and the bedding compost was spread directly in the fields when necessary. This \n\nbedding compost was appearing with fluffy consistency. The pack had dimensions of 18.3 \n\nm x 18.3 m and the stock density was 9.3 m2 per cow (Appendix A - Table A.1).  \n\nThe average surface temperature measured was 17.2\u00b0C (\u00b110.2). The average bedding \n\ntemperatures across 0.1 m and 0.2 m depths were 52.3\u00b0C (\u00b17.5) and 58.0\u00b0C (\u00b110.3), \n\nrespectively. Paired t-test statistical analysis indicated that these two averages were \n\ndifferent (P &lt;0.05). Temperature is directly proportional to the biological activity within \n\nthe composting bedded-pack. Maintaining a temperature of 52\u00b0C or more for 3 to 4 days \n\nfavors the destruction of fly larvae and keeping the pack surface dry (Janni et al., 2005). \n\nAverage bedding moisture was 54.7% (\u00b12.7), ranging from 51.0 to 58.6% (Appendix A \n\n- Table A.5).

The wet compost was found in this barn, with \n\nmainly slurry consistency. The pack was aerated once a day in the summer and winter time. \n\nA tractor was pushing a chisel plow (Figure 4.59).  The bedding materials were aerated to a \n\ndepth of 0.20 m, which is less than minimum recommended depth of 0.25 m to 0.30 m \n\n(Janni et al., 2007). This barn was cleaned out twice a year. The pack had dimensions of \n\n14.6 m x 10.1 m and the stock density was 7.7 m2 per cow (Appendix A - Table A1).   \n\nThe average bedding temperatures at surface and 0.1 m and 0.2 m depths were 8.9\u00b0C \n\n(\u00b12.9), 23.5\u00b0C (\u00b112.6), and 32.1\u00b0C (\u00b17.2), respectively. Paired t-test statistical analysis \n\n\n\n140\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nindicated that at the 0.05 significance level, the averages for the two depths were not \n\ndifferent (Appendix A - Table A.4).  \n\nThe average bedding moisture was 66.5% (\u00b12.2), which is high than the recommended \n\nfor composting of 45% to 60% moisture (NRAES-54, 1992). The minimum bedding \n\nmoisture was 64.3% and the maximum was 70.6% (Appendix A - Table A.5). The first and \n\nthird quartiles were 64.6% and 67.1%, respectively.  \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.59 - Barn 16 was aerated using chisel plow. \n\n \nBarn 17 was bedded using kiln dried wood shavings. This barn was cleaned out once a \n\nyear. The pack was aerated twice a day (summer and winter time), using a chisel plow \n\n(Figure 4.60), and the pack was aerated to a depth of 0.30 m. The compost appeared \n\nrelatively wet and dried fine material was spread out on top of the compost, however, it still \n\nsticks to the boots, when one was walking on the surface. The pack had dimensions of 37.8 \n\nm x 13.7 m and the stock density was 4.3 m2 per cow (Appendix A - Table A.1). \n\nThe average bedding temperatures at surface and 0.1 m and 0.2 m depths were 11.7\u00b0C \n\n(\u00b15.0), 37.4\u00b0C (\u00b116.6), and 36.6\u00b0C (\u00b117.0), respectively (Appendix A - Table A.4). Paired \n\nt-test statistical analysis indicated that the averages for the two depths were not different (P \n\n&lt;0.05).  \n\nThe average bedding moisture was 56.0% (\u00b14.3), ranged from 50.2% to 62.4% \n\n(Appendix A - Table A.5).

This package was very wet, \n\nwhen walking atop it, the boots were sunk in up to ankles in some spots (Figure 4.61a). The \n\nbedding material was aerated twice a day in the summer and winter time, using chisel plow \n\n(Figure 4.61b) while cows are being milked. The bedded pack had dimensions of 61.0 m x \n\n24.4 m and the stock density was 12.9 m2 per cow. This value is high than suggested \n\nminimum (7.4 m2 per cow) by Janni et al. (2007). Compost barns will not perform well if \n\nthe cows are overcrowded. Details can be seen in Appendix A (Table A.1). \n\nThe average surface temperature measured was -5.1\u00b0C (\u00b13.5). The average of the pack \n\ntemperature in the depth 0.1 m and 0.2 m were 12.3\u00b0C (\u00b19.7) and 20.9\u00b0C (\u00b110.9), \n\nrespectively (Appendix A - Table A.4). Paired t-test statistical analysis indicated that the \n\naverages for the two depths were different (P &lt;0.05). An anaerobic pack shows lower \n\ntemperatures which leads to reduced pathogen kill and odor problems (Graves, 1999). \n\nThe average bedding moisture was 64.8% (\u00b10.8), which was above NRAES-54 (1992) \n\nrecommended level of 50% to 60%. When moisture is too high, the pack becomes \n\nanaerobic (lack of oxygen), rate of microbial decomposition will slow, and the composting \n\nwill again be too slow (Bewley and Taraba, 2009). The minimum bedding moisture was \n\n63.5% and the maximum was 66.0%. The first and third quartiles were 64.2% and 65.6%, \n\nrespectively (Appendix A - Table A.5).  \n\n \n\n\n\n142\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.61 - Barn 18 was aerated using chisel plow. \n\n \nBarn 19 was bedded with Kiln dried wood shavings.

It is common for farmers to have to add more media in the winter \n\ndue to the cold weather inhibiting airflow in the barn thus reducing the drying of the \n\nsurface of the pack (Changirath et al., 2011). The pack was aerated once a day while the \n\ncows were milked, using a chisel plow.

This farmer was trying to minimize the aeration to two or three times per \n\nweek or less. The reason given was to lower labor and fuel costs with seeming little benefit \n\nto the bedded pack through drying or mixing.

A load of green sawdust was added every \n\nthree weeks. In the winter time, fresh green sawdust was necessary to be added more \n\nfrequently. This barn was cleaned out twice a year. Care must be taken when removing the \n\nbedded pack during clean out, or during pack stirring when the bedded pack is less than \n\n0.30 m deep, to avoid disturbing the base of the barn (Janni et al., 2005). The pack had \n\ndimensions of 45.8 m x 10.7 m and the stock density was 10.0 m2 per cow. \n\nThe average surface temperature measured was 4.7\u00b0C (\u00b12.9). The average of the pack \n\ntemperature in the depth 0.1 m and 0.2 m were 20.2\u00b0C (\u00b115.3) and 25.3\u00b0C (\u00b116.6), \n\nrespectively. Paired t-test statistical analysis indicated that the averages for the two depths \n\nwere different (P &lt;0.05). Details can be seen in Appendix A (Table A.4) \n\nThe average bedding moisture was 64.3% (\u00b13.5), which was above NRAES-54 (1992) \n\nrecommended level of 45% to 60%. The minimum bedding moisture was 57.0% and the \n\nmaximum was 68.7%. The first and third quartiles were 63.4% and 66.5%, respectively. \n\nThe average moisture content of bedding in this barn is given in Appendix A (Table A.5). \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.80 - Bedded with green sawdust and chisel plow used in CBP barn 37. \n\n \nBarn 38 was bedded with green sawdust (Figure 4.81). The compost appeared relatively \n\nloose and dry and did not stick to the boots when walking on the surface. The bedded pack \n\nwas aerated once a day, at least 0.20 m deep. According to Endres (2009), the bedded pack \n\nshould be aerated twice daily, at least 0.25 m deep, to keep it aerobic and fluffy, hence \n\nbiological activity generates heat and helps dry the pack. This barn was cleaned out twice a \n\nyear and a load of fresh green sawdust was added every three weeks. The pack had \n\ndimensions of 36.6 m x 21.7 m and the stock density was 15.9 m2 per cow. \n\n\n\n156\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThe average bedding temperatures at surface was 3.8\u00b0C (\u00b12.3). Paired t-test statistical \n\nanalysis indicated that at the 0.05 significance level, the averages for the two depths were \n\ndifferent. When comparing the pack temperature of the two depths, was found that the \n\naverage of the depth 0.1 m was less than the average of the depth 0.2 m (Appendix A - \n\nTable A.4).  \n\nThe average bedding moisture was 61.7% (\u00b16.4). The minimum bedding moisture was \n\n50.5% and the maximum was 67.7% (Appendix A - Table A.5). The first and third \n\nquartiles were 56.9% and 66.7%, respectively.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.81 - Barn 38 was bedded with green sawdust. \n \n\nBarns 39 and 40 were bedded using green sawdust (Figure 4.82a). These barns were \n\nstirred at least twice a day (summer and winter) when the cows are being milked. The \n\npacks were aerated 0.18 m depth. Bedded packs stirring were done using a chisel plow \n\nattached to the back of a tractor (Figure 4.82b). These barns had the same bedded pack \n\ndimensions of 48.8 m x 22.0 m. The stock density of the barn 39 and 40 were 12.2 m2 per \n\ncow and 12.6 m2 per cow, respectably. Details can be seen in Appendix A (Table A.1). \n\nThe average surface temperature measured in Barns 11 and 12 were -1.7\u00b0C (\u00b14.5) and \n\n0.0\u00b0C (\u00b18.3), respectively. Paired t-test statistical analysis indicated that there were \n\nsignificant (P &lt;0.05) differences in average temperatures for the two depths in both of \n\nbarns (Appendix A - Table A.4).  \n\nThe average bedding moisture in Barns 39 and 40 were 66.5% (\u00b11.0) and 64.6% (\u00b11.7), \n\nrespectively. Details can be seen in Appendix A (Table A.5). \n\n \n\n\n\n157\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.82 - Bedded with green sawdust and chisel plow used in CBP barns 39 and 40. \n\n \nBarn 41 was bedded with kiln dried wood shavings or sawdust. This farmer used chisel \n\nplow (Figure 4.83) to aeration once a day (summer and winter). The pack was aerated 0.15 \n\nm depth. According to Endres (2009), some producers in Minnesota are aerating the pack \n\ndeeper (about 0.35 \u2013 0.40 m) using a chisel plow type of equipment, and they have \n\nobserved a reduction in bedding needs and increased pack temperatures. Clean bedding \n\nwas added every time the bedded pack became moist enough for it to adhere to the cows \n\nand a load of fresh material was added every three weeks. The pack had dimensions of 30.5 \n\nm x 15.3 m and the stock density was 5.2 m2 per cow (Appendix A - Table A.1). \n\nThe surface pack temperature measured was -4.0\u00b0C (\u00b12.3). The average of the pack \n\ntemperature in the depth 0.1 m [25.2\u00b0C (\u00b115.1)] was less than the average of the depth 0.2 \n\nm [30.0\u00b0C (\u00b15.9)], as can been see in Appendix A (Table A.4). Paired t-test statistical \n\nanalysis indicated that these two averages were different (P &lt;0.05). \n\nThe average bedding moisture was 70.1% (\u00b12.7), which is high than the recommended \n\nfor composting of 45% to 60% moisture (NRAES-54, 1992). The minimum bedding \n\nmoisture was 65.2% and the maximum was 71.7% (Appendix A - Table A.5). The first and \n\nthird quartiles were 69.1% and 71.7%, respectively.  \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.83 - Kiln dried wood shavings and chisel plow used in CBP barn 41. \n\n\n\n158\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nBarn 42 was bedded with mix material. Tilling was performed twice a day in the \n\nsummer and winter time, using a chisel plow with 0.20 m shovels (Figure 4.84). The chisel \n\nplow tills to a depth of 0.14 m \u2013 0.18 m. This farmer cleaned out once a year and leave \n\nabout 0.05 m of old material in the barn to help initiate microbial activity. This pack was \n\ncleaned out one time per year. The bedded pack had dimensions of 53.7 m x 14.9 m and the \n\nstock density was 8.0 m2 per cow, as can been see in Appendix A (Table A.1). \n\nThe bedding temperatures measured at two depths were 18.2\u00b0C (\u00b125.1) and 24.8\u00b0C \n\n(\u00b15.1) and the pack surface temperatures was 0.9\u00b0C (\u00b13.5). Paired t-test statistical analysis \n\nindicated that these two averages were different (P &lt;0.05). \n\nThe average bedding moisture was 69.1% (\u00b11.2). The minimum bedding moisture was \n\n67.6% and the maximum was 70.7%. The first and third quartiles were 68.3% and 70.2%, \n\nrespectively. More details about Barn 42 are given in Appendix A (Table A.1). \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.84 - Chisel plow was used to aeration in CBP barn 42. \n\n \n4.2.4. Environment characteristics \n\nThe average temperature gradient (taken at 0.05 m and 1.20 m above the pack) was       \n\n-0.52 \u00b0C \u00b7 m-1 (\u00b1 1.0), indicating that there was a reduction of the air temperature along the \n\nheight measurement. Paired t-test statistical analysis indicated that at the 0.05 significance \n\nlevel, the averages air temperatures for the two heights were different. The average surface \n\ntemperatures on the pack were similar to the average ambient temperature. During the \n\nwinter, the temperature would be the first indicator of changes in bed performance (Taraba \n\nand Bewley, 2010). Air temperatures tended to be lower inside barns which utilized \n\nOvershot or Capped ridge, mechanical ventilation system and ridge direction of SW or NW \n\n(Table 4.1). Building temperatures must remain above freezing most of the time to prevent \n\nfrozen manure in the pack. This type of building requires insulation (curtains) and a \n\ncontrolled ventilation system. Most compost packs were warmer than the outdoor air \n\n\n\n159\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ntemperature. This indicates that the packs were heating and microbial activity was \n\noccurring.  \n\nThe average relative humidity gradient in this study was 2.35 % \u00b7 m-1 (\u00b1 0.5). Thus, the \n\nmajority of barns tend to increase relative humidity along the height. Paired t-test statistical \n\nanalysis indicated that the averages relative humidity for the two heights were different (P \n\n&lt;0.05). In some barns, sawdust bedding was used to keep cattle comfortable and dry in \n\nhigher amounts which increases barn operating costs. \n\nThe average of air velocity gradient was -0.22 m s-1 \u00b7 m-1 (\u00b1 0.3), indicating that the air \n\nvelocity decreased along the height. Paired t-test statistical analysis indicated that at the \n\n0.05 significance level, the averages air velocity for the two heights were different. Thus, \n\nduring the season of fall and winter in Kentucky, the barn orientation was not ideal for air \n\nmovement since air generally moving along the length meets higher resistance than air \n\nmoving across the building.\u00a0 Sufficient air exchange is needed in cold weather to remove \n\nmoisture from the pack and extend the time between bedding addition. Overall, the low \n\nsidewalls of the barns promoted high air velocity across the barns. Air movement through \n\nthe barn should be sufficient to maintain inside temperature only slightly above outside \n\ntemperature in winter and slightly below outside temperature in summer. A considerable \n\ndifferences between air velocity indoor and outdoor were observed in barns 1, 5, 6, 11, 12, \n\n13, 14, 16, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 37, and 38. Buildings and other obstacles (trees, hills, and \n\ntractors) around of these barns blocked for airflow and results in more high relative \n\nhumidity, as can be seen in Table 4.1. On the other hand, high airflow during the winter \n\ncan reduce the air temperature indoor and the pack temperature. In those conditions, \n\nwindbreaks become very important. In the winter, side curtains can be an important \n\ninvestment to reduce barn ventilation and winter winds from extracting too much heat from \n\na compost bed (Taraba and Bewley, 2010). \n\n\n\n160\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nTable 4.1 - Average air temperatures, relative humidity and air velocity inside and outside in 42 CBP barns in Kentucky. \n\nBarn \n\nAir Temperature (\u00b0C) Relative Humidity (%) Air velocity (m/s) Outside weather \n\n0.05 m 1.2 m 0.05 m 1.2 m 0.05 m 1.2 m \nAir \n\ntemp. \nR.

Herd characteristics \n\nThe following section summarizes information collected by a collaborator (Black, \n\n2012). It is included to give a more full picture of the benefits of this type barn. \n\nThe cow herd size, as reported by the dairymen, was adjusted for breed size and milk \n\nproduction. The average herd size on the pack in the study was 89.7 cows, ranging from 19 \n\nto 184 cows and dry cow numbers ranged from 3 to 75 dry cows with an average of 25.1 \n\ndry cows (Figure 4.85). Dry cows were housed on pasture, in a separate or the same area of \n\nthe compost barn as the lactating cows, or in an alternative housing area. Breeds consisted \n\nof Jersey (6.8%), Holstein (72.7%), and mix (20.5%). Average milk production of cows \n\nwas 27.2 kg per day with a mean fat and protein percentage of 3.85% and 2.35%, \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.85 - Herd size and dry cows number in 42 CBP barns. \n\n \n\n4.2.6. Producer Responses \n\nAll producers visited were very satisfied with their compost barns. They observed that \n\ncows were more comfortable (24.2%) and that this housing system resulted in increased \n\ncow cleanliness (12.1%), see Table 4.2 below for more details. \n\n\n\n163\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nTable 4.2 - Producer cited benefits of 42 CBP barns. \n\nBenefits Percent (%) \nImproved cow comfort 24.1 \nImproved cow cleanliness 12.1 \nLow maintenance 9.5 \nGood for heifers, lame, fresh, problem, and old cows 8.6 \nNatural resting position (no stalls) 7.8 \nImproved feet and legs 6.9 \nProximity to parlor (compared to pasture) 6.9 \nDecreased SCC 5.2 \nIncreased heat detection 5.2 \nEase of manure handling 2.6 \nIncreased dry matter intake (compared to pasture) 2.6 \nIncreased production 2.6 \nIncreased longevity 2.6 \nFewer leg and teat injuries 1.7 \nMinimizes time standing on concrete 1.7 \n\n \n\nHowever, results of the survey revealed some aspects of the CBP barn producers would \n\nchange. Their main concern was the size or capacity of the barn (25%). Further, many \n\nproducers indicated the need for retaining wall (10%) and curtains (8.3%). Other \n\nrecommended facilities changes are cited in Table 4.3. \n\n \n\nTable 4.3 - Recommended facilities changes of CBP barns producers. \n\nRecommended Percent (%) \n\nIncrease size or capacity of the barn 25.0 \n\nHigher sidewalls and improved ventilation 20.0 \n\nAdd a retaining wall 10.0 \n\nAdd curtains 8.3 \n\nMore fans 8.3 \n\nLarger ridge vent 8.3 \n\nNo posts in pack 6.7 \n\nChange number or location of waterers 6.7 \n\nChange location or size of feed bunk 6.7 \n\n \n\n\n\n164\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThe majority of producers were concerned about the supply of bedding. Many \n\nproducers were seeking secure bedding supply (17.7%) and alternative bedding sources \n\nthat will work in the CBP (9.7%). Producer recommendations also included  the \n\nimportance of  maintaining the pack (8.1%), and stirring the pack two times per day or \n\nmore frequently (14.5%), using kiln-dried shavings (9.7%), avoid the use of straw, wheat \n\nstraw, corn fodder, or soybean fodder or pine as a bedding material (9.7%), and \n\nmaintaining the pack by keeping moisture low (8.1%), as can be seen in Table 4.4. Some \n\nproducers (4.8%) reported that touring other barns was an important influence on their \n\nchoice of structure. Producers also reported that they spoke with other producers managing \n\na CBP barn, they created their own plans, they reviewed freestall plans and designs, \n\neconomics, and ease of management. Producers learned that using kiln-dried shavings, \n\nkeeping the pack stirred, and avoiding the use of straw in the bedding, would help to \n\nprevent other mistakes.  \n\n \n\nTable 4.4 - Producer recommendations and lessons learned of CBP barns producers. \n\nRecommendations and lessons learned Percent (%) \n\nSecure a bedding supply 17.7 \n\nDo not use straw, wheat straw, corn fodder, bean fodder, or pine 9.7 \n\nAdd bedding frequently 6.5 \n\nTour other barns 4.8 \n\nStir two times per day or more frequently 14.5 \n\nKeep pack maintained and moisture low  8.1 \n\nBuild the barn large 6.5 \n\nAdd curtains 4.8 \n\nUse kiln-dried shavings 9.7 \n\nMinimum of 9.3 m2 per cow 8.1 \n\nDesignated tractor for stirring 4.8 \n\nDo not start pack during winter 4.8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n165\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n4.3. Physical, chemical, and thermal properties of compost materials \n\n4.3.1. Compost particle size distribution \n\nDried compost was sieved to measure the portion of each particle size range (PS2, PS3, \n\nPS4, and PS5) comprising the total amount. Three samples of each particle size range were \n\nused to determinate the compost particle size distribution. Particle size distributions on a \n\nweight basis (for compost from CBP barns using Green sawdust, Kiln-dried shavings or \n\nsawdust, and Mix compost) are presented in Figures 4.86. \n\nA comparison of the particle weight fraction distributions content in Figure 4.86 reveals \n\nthat these compost materials from the CBP barns using different bedding compost materials \n\nare very different. The following percentages and standard deviations were found: in Green \n\nsawdust, in the particle size ranges together (PS2 + PS3 + PS4 + PS5) comprised 60.95 \u00b1 \n\n10.0% of the total weight, while coarser material represented 3.46 \u00b1 3.4% and finer \n\nmaterial, 35.60 \u00b1 11.3%. In Kiln-dried shavings or sawdust, the compost particle size \n\ndistribution were 25.44 \u00b1 13.1% (finer material), 25.45 \u00b1 8.5% (PS2), 4.12 \u00b1 1.0% (PS3), \n\n10.50 \u00b1 3.0% (PS4), 28.1 \u00b1 14.2% (PS5), and 6.32 \u00b1 8.1% (coarser material). In this plot \n\n(Figure 4.85), the distribution values of Mix materials increased in the order of Finer &lt;PS2 \n\n&lt;PS5 &lt;PS4 &lt;PS3 &lt;Coarser fractions. In CBP barns using Mix compost material, the \n\nlower and higher compost particle size distribution were 14.38% (Coarser > 25.00 mm) and \n\n48.66% (Finer &lt;2.00 mm), respectively. \n\nThe analysis of variance between of compost particle ranges from all CBP barns was \n\nobtained and is shown in Figure 4.87 at the significance level of p &lt;0.05. The Tukey test \n\nshows that there was a significant difference between average values of compost particle \n\nranges. This results indicate that the distribution of mass weight increased in the order of \n\nCoarser = PS3 &lt;PS4 &lt;PS5 = PS2 &lt;PS2 = Finer. The average finer index expressed as \n\nweight percent in the samples studied was 30.1%. Details about statistic analysis can be \n\nseen in Appendix F (Table 1). \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n166\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 4.86 - Particle Weight Fractions for compost bedded from CBP barn using Green \nsawdust, Kiln-dried shavings or sawdust, and Mix compost. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.87 - Analysis of variance between compost particle ranges for all bed compost \n\nmaterials. Values followed by different letters are significantly different (P &lt;\n0.05; Tukey). \n\n \n4.3.2. Particle density, bulk density, and porosity \n\nParticle density, bulk density, and porosity of 42 compost bulking material results are \n\nshown in Table 4.5.  \n\nParticle density of all compost material studied ranged from 0.86 to 1.11 g cm-3 with an \n\naverage of 0.98 g cm-3 and a standard deviation of 0.02 (Table 4.5). Generally, the compost \n\nmaterials of CBP barns 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 32, 33, 36, 40, \n\n\n\n167\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n41, and 42 show high particle density (? 1g cm-3) compared with other materials (Table \n\n4.5). It should be noted that the obtained values are somewhat higher than expected, but \n\nevaporation of water increase the solids content, particularly with well performing beds or \n\nhigh cow density. Cows that spend time in pasture may return soil to bed.  \n\nResults and standard errors of bulk density for compost bed material collected from \n\neach barn are shown below (Table 4.5). The average bulk density was 0.37 \u00b1 0.02 g cm-3 \n\nwith a range of 0.15 to 0.54 g cm-3. Higher bulk density suggests that the compost have less \n\npore space and are more compact. The highest bulk density value was 3.6 times that of the \n\nlower bulk density value. \n\nThe average porosity of the bedding material in all compost barns was 62.65 \u00b1 2.14% \n\nwith a range of 47.43 to 77.32%. In general, the average porosity increased when the bulk \n\ndensity decreased, significantly higher porosity was found in Barns 41 (77.32%). The \n\nvariation of average porosity in all compost bulking material was similar to those bulk \n\ndensity in the reverse order due to the inverse relationship between bulk density and \n\nporosity (Table 4.5). So, high bulk density and low porosity might cause poor aeration and \n\nlimiting oxygen concentration uptake by microorganisms and inhibiting microorganisms \n\ngrowth.  Previous researchers have reported the optimum and minimum range of porosity \n\nfor aerobic process in compost systems was 85 to 90%, and 30%, respectively (Schulze, \n\n1962; Rynk, 1992; Nappi and Barberis, 1993).   \n\n \nTable 4.5 - Particle density, bulk density, and porosity in 42 compost-bulking materials, as \n\nwell as standard deviations (n = 3). \n\nBarn  \nParticle density Bulk density  Porosity \n\n (g cm-3) (g cm-3)  (%) \n1 0.95 \u00b1 0.06 0.50 \u00b1 0.06 77.12 \u00b1 8.23 \n2 0.98 \u00b1 0.06 0.47 \u00b1 0.01 72.30 \u00b1 3.30 \n3 0.92 \u00b1 0.04 0.38 \u00b1 0.02 65.41 \u00b1 2.25 \n4 0.86 \u00b1 0.04 0.31 \u00b1 0.01 65.40 \u00b1 1.84 \n5 0.93 \u00b1 0.07 0.47 \u00b1 0.03 60.53 \u00b1 3.26 \n6 0.91 \u00b1 0.05 0.45 \u00b1 0.01 60.50 \u00b1 3.40 \n7 0.97 \u00b1 0.06 0.37 \u00b1 0.01 62.07 \u00b1 1.65 \n8 0.99 \u00b1 0.05 0.47 \u00b1 0.13 53.63 \u00b1 11.28 \n9 1.04 \u00b1 0.05 0.54 \u00b1 0.02 47.43 \u00b1 3.61 \n10 0.94 \u00b1 0.06 0.45 \u00b1 0.01 51.92 \u00b1 2.30 \n11 1.01 \u00b1 0.03 0.44 \u00b1 0.04 56.52 \u00b1 4.34 \n12 1.05 \u00b1 0.07 0.45 \u00b1 0.02 56.70 \u00b1 4.75 \n\nContinue... \n\n\n\n168\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nTable 4.5 - Particle density, bulk density, and porosity in 42 compost-bulking materials, as \nwell as standard deviations (n = 3). \n\nBarn  \nParticle density Bulk density  Porosity \n\n (g cm-3) (g cm-3)  (%) \n13 1.00 \u00b1 0.01 0.35 \u00b1 0.03 67.37 \u00b1 2.18 \n14 0.99 \u00b1 0.03 0.32 \u00b1 0.01 65.21 \u00b1 2.01 \n15 0.92 \u00b1 0.03 0.28 \u00b1 0.05 68.64 \u00b1 6.60 \n16 1.01 \u00b1 0.02 0.24 \u00b1 0.01 76.72 \u00b1 1.57 \n17 0.98 \u00b1 0.04 0.44 \u00b1 0.01 55.31 \u00b1 2.83 \n18 0.90 \u00b1 0.02 0.40 \u00b1 0.02 56.00 \u00b1 2.18 \n19 0.92 \u00b1 0.11 0.27 \u00b1 0.01 71.99 \u00b1 4.26 \n20 1.06 \u00b1 0.01 0.48 \u00b1 0.03 54.81 \u00b1 2.62 \n21 1.01 \u00b1 0.02 0.24 \u00b1 0.01 75.90 \u00b1 1.02 \n22 1.00 \u00b1 0.01 0.39 \u00b1 0.01 60.94 \u00b1 0.96 \n23 1.02 \u00b1 0.06 0.36 \u00b1 0.00 64.73 \u00b1 2.43 \n24 0.97 \u00b1 0.01 0.28 \u00b1 0.01 70.80 \u00b1 1.10 \n25 1.00 \u00b1 0.03 0.39 \u00b1 0.01 61.11 \u00b1 0.41 \n26 1.11 \u00b1 0.01 0.42 \u00b1 0.01 62.29 \u00b1 0.75 \n27 0.94 \u00b1 0.05 0.34 \u00b1 0.02 64.10 \u00b1 0.94 \n28 1.04 \u00b1 0.05 0.43 \u00b1 0.01 58.88 \u00b1 2.64 \n29 1.06 \u00b1 0.04 0.35 \u00b1 0.02 66.83 \u00b1 1.20 \n30 0.97 \u00b1 0.04 0.37 \u00b1 0.00 61.68 \u00b1 2.11 \n31 1.04 \u00b1 0.02 0.39 \u00b1 0.01 62.58 \u00b1 1.81 \n32 1.00 \u00b1 0.00 0.42 \u00b1 0.01 57.80 \u00b1 0.65 \n33 0.93 \u00b1 0.02 0.33 \u00b1 0.02 64.66 \u00b1 2.52 \n34 0.97 \u00b1 0.02 0.27 \u00b1 0.02 71.80 \u00b1 2.12 \n35 1.01 \u00b1 0.01 0.40 \u00b1 0.02 59.73 \u00b1 1.78 \n36 0.95 \u00b1 0.00 0.41 \u00b1 0.01 57.26 \u00b1 1.44 \n37 0.91 \u00b1 0.01 0.38 \u00b1 0.06 58.34 \u00b1 6.60 \n38 0.87 \u00b1 0.04 0.38 \u00b1 0.02 56.11 \u00b1 4.06 \n39 1.03 \u00b1 0.02 0.40 \u00b1 0.02 61.39 \u00b1 0.78 \n40 1.06 \u00b1 0.03 0.34 \u00b1 0.03 57.50 \u00b1 1.87 \n41 1.05 \u00b1 0.00 0.20 \u00b1 0.03 77.32 \u00b1 2.67 \n42 1.05 \u00b1 0.01 0.32 \u00b1 0.04 54.20 \u00b1 3.78 \n\nAverage 0.98 \u00b1 0.02 0.38 \u00b1 0.02 62.65 \u00b1 2.14 \n \n\n4.3.3. Water holding capacity \n\nThe water holding capacity (WHC) was evaluated in this study to determine whether \n\nthe beds operated under moisture conditions that would allow drainage of contaminated \n\nwater to compost bed base which could infiltrate into groundwater. Since WHC has very \n\nimportant relationship with physical and biological properties of bed compost materials, the \n\nmoisture levels were set based on the WHC to find the real structure and texture conditions \n\n\n\n169\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nof compost providing aeration and microbial activity. So, WHC was achieved in the first 12 \n\nhours of natural drainage from an initial moisture content greater than the media WHC. \n\nThe values of WHC and moisture content in 42 bed compost materials are illustrated in \n\nFigure 4.88. The average WHC of all bed compost was at 72.7% on a wet weight basis  \n\nwith a range of 53.6 to 79.8%. WHC was lower for bed compost in CBP barn 1 to the other \n\nmaterials tested and was able to hold water up to 53.6% w.b. moisture content. As \n\nexpected, the smaller particle size range was able to hold more water (Table 4.5). WHC \n\nincreases with increasingly fine particle size (decreasingly porosity), as can be seen in \n\nFigure 4.88. Coarse particle size of compost have a lower WHC since they are high in large \n\npores subject to free drainage. Fine particle size have a greater occurrence of small pores \n\nthat hold water against free drainage, resulting in a higher WHC values. Therefore, beds \n\ntypically operate under MC conditions that would not allow drainage. Good operating \n\nrange was 40-60% which is below WHC and that groundwater drainage would not occur \n\nwhen bed managed properly. \n\nThe present study indicates a positive relationship between WHC and moisture content \n\n(r = 0.383, P &lt;0.05), see Figure 4.88. Thereby, WHC increased with increasing moisture \n\ncontent. Ahn et al. (2008) reported that WHC increased with increasing moisture content \n\nuntil certain level. They suggested that moisture promotes aggregation of particles, and \n\nthen decreased porosity. Finally, the lower porosity decreases the WHC.  \n\nThe WHC method was adequate to estimate the maximum amount of moisture that \n\ncould be added to the bed compost without the occurrence of adequate drainage or runoff, \n\nthus avoiding contamination of the soil or water outside the barn. \n\n \n\n\n\n170\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nFigure 4.88 - Water holding capacity (w. b., %), initial moisture content (w. b., %), and \n\nporosity (%) of 42 bed compost materials. \n \n\n\n\n171\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n4.3.4. Chemical properties of composts \n\nResults related to total nitrogen (N), total carbon (C), and carbon-nitrogen ratio (C:N) \n\nof each bed compost material are shown in Figure 4.89. Each value is an average of nine \n\nsamples collected as previously described (Figure 3.5). Further results regarding other \n\nchemical compounds are shown in Appendix A (Table 6). \n\nThe average total C was 42.7 \u00b1 3.8% with a range of 29.8 to 47.1%. One of the major \n\nconstituent of the compost, C, was most abundant (47.1%) in CBP barn 19. Only in the \n\nbarn 9 contain average total C lower than 30.0%. Shane et al. (2010) reported a range total \n\nC of 12.7 to 20.1% in six compost barns in Minnesota collected in two different depth.   \n\nThus, the bed composts in Kentucky have not stabilized to the extend in this study. In \n\ngeneral, many of the beds had not been operating properly, but as a result, the dairy \n\nproducers learned how to improve beds to operate properly. \n\nThe average total N was 1.6% ranged from 0.5 to 2.5%. Shane et al. (2010) reported \n\nan average total N of 0.76% with a range of 0.61 to 0.89% during the winter. Barberg et al. \n\n(2007) reported an average total N of 2.54% with a range of 0.57 to 4.22%. Russelle et al. \n\n(2009) reported average N of 1.12% in eight compost barns in Minnesota. Janni et al. \n\n(2007) reported an average total N of 0.99% six compost barns in Minnesota. Overall, the \n\ntotal N from the 42 bed compost materials tested in the study was similar to those reported \n\npreviously by Barberg et al. (2007) and Shane et al. (2010). Nitrogen level of compost \n\nmaterial is an important factor in the determination of C:N ratio of the composted material. \n\nMicroorganisms for building up their structure of the body require it (Iqbal et al., 2010).  \n\nThe average C:N ratio was 28.5 \u00b1 8.1. The C:N ratio of barn 10 (15.4) was lowest due \n\nto high nitrogen contents as compared to barn 12 (26.2). In barn 20 had the highest C:N \n\nratio (43.9) to the other materials tested. Shane et al. (2010) reported the highest C:N ratio \n\nfound was 26.0 during winter. Barberg et al. (2007) reported an average of 19.5. Russelle et \n\nal. (2009) reported a range of 11.2 to 20.9. Janni et al. (2007) reported an average C:N ratio \n\nof 15.5.  For effective composting C:N ratio of the compost should be ranged 20 to 25 \n\n(Diaz et al., 1993). In another words, a C:N ratio below 25:1 may emit ammonia odor, \n\nwhich may influence the ammonia levels in the compost barns (Rosen et al., 2000). In \n\ngeneral, in the present study it was balance enough. However, the barns 1, 3, 6, 9, 10, and \n\n18 will require an additional source of nitrogen to obtain the optimum bedding compost \n\nC:N ratio between 20 and 25. \n\n\n\n172\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \nFigure 4.89 - Total Carbon (C), Total Nitrogen (N), and C:N ration presents in 42 bedding \n\ncompost. \n \n\n4.3.5. Bacterial analysis of composts \n\nFigure 4.90 shows the pack bacterial count (Coliform, E. Coli, Staphylococcal, \n\nStreptococcal, and Bacillus) and the associated moisture content in the bedding compost \n\nmaterial of 42 CBP barns.  \n\nBedding compost always contained bacterial, but the variation was large between \n\ndifferent sampling sites and times. However, Coliforms were not present in Barn 15 that \n\nhad a higher compost temperature (Appendix A - Table 4). Coliforms, E. Coli, Bacillus and \n\nStreptococcus count were higher in the barn 4 that showed lower moisture content (36.2%). \n\nThe average Coliforms, E. Coli, Streptococcus and Bacillus content in the bedding material \n\nof barn 4 were 247.5 \u00b1 12.0 cfu/g, 173.0 \u00b1 18.38 cfu/g, 3595.0 \u00b1 148.49 cfu/g, and 1810.0 \n\n\u00b1 608.11 cfu/g, respectably. Also, the environmental Staphylococcus were highest in the \n\nbarn 6 that had an average of 2.700 \u00b1 0.00 cfu/g. The present study indicates a inverse \n\nrelationship between moisture content and bacterial counts (Coliforms, r = 0.377, P &lt;0.05; \n\nE. Coli, r = 0.448, P &lt;0.05;  Bacillus, r = 0.372, P &lt;0.05). There are no significant \n\nrelationships between bacterial counts (Streptococcal and Staphylococcal) with moisture \n\ncontent (P > 0.05). \n\n \n\n\n\n173\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \nFigure 4.90 - Bacterial analysis of bedding compost samples in 42 CBP barns. \n \n4.3.6. Thermal properties of composts \n\n4.3.6.1. Thermal properties of composts in different moisture content and compaction \n\ndegree \n\nThe thermal conductivity of unsegregated bed compost materials varied from 0.081 to \n\n0.625 W m-1 K-1 for Green sawdust, 0.071 to 0.618 W m-1 K-1 for Kiln-dried shavings or \n\nsawdust, 0.059 to 0.766W m-1 K-1 for Mix, and 0.105 to 0.406 W m-1 K-1 for average of all \n\ncompost material tested, depending upon the moisture content (30, 45, and 60%) and static \n\ncompaction degree (fluffy, 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 MPa) within the experimental range of \n\nthe variables. An increasing trend in the thermal conductivity of all compost was also \n\nobserved with the increase in both moisture content and static compaction degree for all \n\ncompost material tested (Figure 4.91). The compost with low moisture content exhibited a \n\nlow thermal conductivity because of the presence of a relatively high fraction of air (a poor \n\nconductor). The thermal conductivity increased with compaction due to a reduction in the \n\nvoid space (Chandrakanthi et al., 2005).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n174\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\na) Thermal Conductivity: \n\nMultiple regressions analysis for compost materials showed that there is also a linear \n\nrelationship between thermal conductivity (k) and moisture content (MC) and static \n\ncompaction degree (SC) as follows: \n\na) Green sawdust: \nkgreen = -0.0619 + 0.311 \u00b7 SC + 0.478 \u00b7 MC R\n\n2 = 0.838 (4.1)\n \nb) Kiln-dried shavings or sawdust: \n\nkkiln = -0.0679 + 0.342 \u00b7 SC + 0.487 \u00b7 MC R\n2 = 0.877 (4.2)\n\n \nc) Mix: \n\nkMix = -0.0537 + 0.360 \u00b7 SC + 0.434 \u00b7 MC R\n2 = 0.829 (4.3)\n\n \nd) Average of all compost material: \n\nkAverage = -0.0612 + 0.338 \u00b7 SC + 0.467 \u00b7 MC R\n2 = 0.852 (4.4)\n\n \n\nThe response surface presented in Figure 4.91 was almost flat due to the fitted linear \n\nmodel, except at high moisture content and high static compaction degree, which showed \n\nan abrupt increase. The analysis of variance (Table 4.6) indicates a greater effect of the \n\nstatic compact degree (high F-value) than that of the moisture content on the thermal \n\nconductivity for Green sawdust and Kiln. However, the analysis of variance indicates a \n\ngreater effect of the moisture content than that of the static compaction degree on the \n\nthermal conductivity for Mix. The magnitudes of respective regression coefficients in \n\nequations 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 also confirmed the results. The models seem adequately \n\nfitted based on the observation of high F-value as well as high coefficient of determination \n\n(R2). The models accounted for 83.8% (Green sawdust), 87.7% (Kiln-dried shavings), \n\n82.9% (Mix), and 85.2% (average of all compost material) variation in the thermal \n\nconductivity within the experimental range of input variables.  \n\nThe maximum differences between measured and estimated values of the thermal \n\nconductivity were within \u00b1 0.059 W m-1 K-1 (Green sawdust), \u00b1 0.060 W m-1 K-1 (Kiln-\n\ndried shavings), \u00b1 0.066 W m-1 K-1 (Mix), and \u00b1 0.065 W m-1 K-1 (average of all compost \n\nmaterial) in which define desirable levels of accuracy by the thermal sensor for estimating \n\nthe thermal conductivity (Figure 4.92). \n\nFigure 4.91 revealed that the thermal conductivity of bed compost also increased with \n\nincrease in moisture content and static compaction degree. The thermal conductivity of leaf \n\n\n\n175\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ncompost increased linearly with increase water content and compaction degree, represented \n\nby volume fractions of air (Chandrakanthi et al., 2005).

Generally, the thermal conductivity increases with increasing moisture content \n\nand dynamic compaction. Theoretically, these values can be predictable because \n\ncompaction over time has an direct effect, because it increases the bulk density of compost \n\nby reducing porosity, which increases the thermal conductivity. Thermal conductivity \n\nshowed highest values at 60% of moisture content and 0.4 MPa of dynamic compaction \n\ndegree of Green sawdust (0.643 W m-1 K-1), Kiln-dried shavings or sawdust (0.626 W m-1 \n\nK-1), Mix (0.788 W m-1 K-1), and average of all compost material (0.244 W m-1 K-1).  \n\nMultiple regressions analysis for compost materials showed that there is also a linear \n\nrelationship between thermal conductivity (k) and moisture content (MC) and dynamic \n\ncompaction degree (DC) as follows: \n\na) Green sawdust: \nkgreen = -0.131 + 0.269 \u00b7 DC + 0.689 \u00b7 MC R\n\n2 = 0.925 (4.5)\n \nb) Kiln-dried shavings or sawdust: \n\nkkiln = -0.127 + 0.271 \u00b7 DC + 0.680 \u00b7 MC R\n2 = 0.956 (4.6)\n\n \nc) Mix: \n\nkMix = -0.122 + 0.193 \u00b7 DC + 0.623 \u00b7 MC R\n2 = 0.934 (4.7)\n\n \nd) Average of all compost material: \n\nkAverage = -0.123 + 0.274 \u00b7 DC + 0.664 \u00b7 MC R\n2 = 0.944 (4.8)\n\n \nThe analysis of variance indicates a greater effect of the dynamic compact degree (high \n\nF-value) than that of the moisture content on the thermal conductivity for all material \n\ntested, see Table 4.7. The magnitudes of respective regression coefficients (R2) in \n\nequations 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, and 4.8 also confirmed the results. Thermal conductivity presented \n\nan excellent relationship with moisture content and dynamic compaction degree. To fit the \n\ncurves to the observed data, a linear equation was used (Equations 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, and 4.8). \n\nThis approach is a functional relationship selected purely by their mathematical flexibility \n\nto fit the experimental data points, being the main advantage that it does not require the \n\ndetermination of any additional compost material parameters. Authors in the literature have \n\nalso used these type of equations to relate the compost moisture content and static \n\ncompaction degree with different compost properties (Singh et al., 2007; Ahn et al., 2009). \n\n\n\n179\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThe models seem adequately fitted based on the observation of high F-value as well as high \n\ncoefficient of determination (R2). The models accounted for 92.5% (Green sawdust), \n\n95.6% (Kiln-dried shavings or sawdust), 93.4% (Mix), and 94.4% (average of all compost \n\nmaterial) variation in the thermal conductivity within the experimental range of input \n\nvariables. The maximum differences between measured and estimated values of the \n\nthermal conductivity were within \u00b1 0.037 W m-1 K-1 (Green sawdust), \u00b1 0.033 W m-1 K-1 \n\n(Kiln-dried shavings or sawdust), \u00b1 0.045 W m-1 K-1 (Mix), and \u00b1 0.036 W m-1 K-1 \n\n(average of all compost material), which is desirable accuracy for estimating the thermal \n\nconductivity (Figure 4.94).

Thermal properties of composts in different particle size \n\nThermal conductivity and thermal resistivity of granular materials are affected by \n\nparticle contact quality. The number of contacts per particle depend on the packing density, \n\nparticle shape and particle size distribution. Their effects on thermal conductivity and \n\nthermal resistivity are explored in this section using selected compost materials and the \n\nthermal needle probe technique (Decagon KD2-Pro sensor).  \n\nFigure 4.103 showed the influence of particle size in the thermal conductivity and \n\nthermal resistivity for bed compost samples using Green sawdust, Kiln-dried shavings or \n\nsawdust, and Mix. Thermal conductivity and thermal resistivity were plotted versus particle \n\nsize distribution, just that these two properties were directly observed data. Values of \n\nthermal properties and thermal resistivity were not measured in samples of coarser material \n\nbecause it was not possible to insert the probe of sensor into the sample.  \n\nThe thermal conductivity increases with the decrease of particle size, while thermal \n\nresistivity decreases with the increase of particle size. However, as seen in Figure 4.103, \n\nthe overall thermal conductivity and thermal resistivity varied with each particle size of bed \n\ncompost materials. In general, the thermal conductivity increased with increasing particle \n\nsize, while thermal resistivity decreased with increasing particle size what is the exact \n\nopposite of what was expected (Yun and Santamarina, 2008; Ahn et al., 2009). This \n\nbehavior can probably be explained by considering the higher moisture retention of larger \n\nparticles once compost materials were air dried at the same time. It could possibly have \n\nchanged the values of the thermal properties. Thus, the effect of particle size on thermal \n\nconductivity was more pronounced at higher particle size than at lower particle size. \n\nHowever, the trend of thermal conductivity as a function of particle size, in some barns, \n\nwas very consistent at particle size below than 4.75 mm. It was also observed that thermal \n\nconductivity increased drastically with large particle sizes higher than 8.00 mm. \n\nThe effect of particle size on thermal conductivity was more pronounced for the higher \n\nparticle size than at lower particle size. However, the tendency of lower thermal \n\nconductivity as a function of particle size was very consistent at particle sizes below than \n\n4.75 mm. It was also observed that thermal conductivity increased drastically (> 85%) with \n\nlarge particle sizes higher than 8.00 mm. Thermal resistivity shows a decrease as the \n\ncompost particle size increases after the 4.75 and 5.60 mm range in Mix material (Fig. \n\n4.103c).   \n\n\n\n195\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThe average values and standard deviation of thermal resistivity for all particle sizes \n\nwere 585.1 \u00b1 117.0\u00b0C cm / W (Green sawdust), 600.8 \u00b1 140.8\u00b0C cm / W (Kiln-dried \n\nshavings or sawdust), and 572.4 \u00b1 109.0\u00b0C cm / W (Mix), respectively. In a compost \n\nmaterial with smaller particle sizes, a fraction of the particles form a resistivity pathway, \n\nwhich could result in enhanced thermal resistivity. \n\nThe analysis of variance between thermal conductivity and compost particle size \n\nranges for all bed compost materials (moisture content ? 30%)  is shown in Figure 4.104.  \n\nThe Tukey test with a significance level of p &lt;0.05 was applied. There was significant \n\ndifferences between the thermal conductivity and compost particle size. In general, the \n\nvalues of thermal conductivity were higher in compost materials with particle sizes larger \n\nthan 8.00 mm.  Details about statistic analysis can be seen in Appendix F (Table 2).  \n\nThe thermal conductivity of bed compost materials varied from 0.088 to 0.608 W m?1 \n\nK?1 depending upon the particle size. An increasing trend in the thermal conductivity of \n\nbed compost materials was also observed with the increase particle size (Figure 4.104), \n\nwhich is in general agreement with previous findings of some researchers.

(2009) showed that the thermal conductivity of 0.03 to 0.05 W m?1 K?1 to dry \n\nsawdust and 0.03 to 0.06 W m?1 K?1 to dry wood shavings. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n196\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \nFigure 4.103 - Changes in thermal conductivity (W / m K) and thermal resistivity with \n\ndifferent compost particle size of compost materials: (a) Green sawdust, (b) \nKiln-dried shavings or sawdust, and (c) Mix. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n197\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nFigure 4.104 - Analysis of variance between thermal conductivity and compost particle \n\nranges (mm) for all bed compost materials.

The Tukey test shows that there was a significant difference between the values of \n\nthermal resistivity and compost particle size.

The \n\naverage values of thermal resistivity in particle size between 4.75 and 8.00 mm (PS3 and \n\nPS4) were statistically similar.

Mesh details \n\nThe most important aspect of the CFD model, as regards its meshing, was the eave and \n\nridge openings areas which, in order to resolve the small length scale and sharp gradient in \n\nthe airflow, required a high-resolution mesh. On the other hand, near the top of the \n\ncomputational domain, cells could be relatively large. The mesh type is very important for \n\naccurate CFD calculation. The meshes can be mainly composed of hexahedral and \n\ntetrahedral volume mesh elements for a 3-D computational domain (Lee et al., 2007). \n\nBecause of the complicated shapes of the CBP barn, a tetrahedral mesh was built in \n\ncommercial ANSYS ICEM CFD\u00ae and a test of the different meshes was carried out using \n\nthis software. Various size of tetrahedral meshes were used, and after several levels of \n\npreviously evaluated refinement, no significant differences (p &lt;0.05) in the air velocity \n\nand air temperature were encountered. Thus, the selected mesh was composed of 162,191 \n\nnodes and 683,222 elements (Figure 4.106). Such a meshing system was found to conform \n\neasily to the exact boundary of the scale model.  \n\n \n\n\n\n199\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nFigure 4.106 - Computational grid mesh detail of the scale model: (a) sidewall and compost \npack area, (b) external structure, (c) barn model with roof, and (d) the \nvolume mesh. \n\n \n\nAlthough designing meshes was very time consuming, it was one of the most important \n\nprocedures to effectively increase the accuracy of CFD results. Unlike the CFD models \n\ndeveloped for other engineering fields, the natural ventilation study of agricultural \n\nbuildings requires a very big computational domain because a vertically and horizontally \n\nsufficient area should be secured around the dairy barns. This larger volume needs to be \n\nenough to for simulating natural air flow. If the distance between the dairy barn  and the \n\nboundary walls of the computational domain was not sufficiently secured, the faster airflow \n\nstream could be compared with the natural airflow resulting in unreal airflow around the \n\nleeward vent opening (Lee et al., 2007). In this study, the size of the CFD domain used \n\nduring the simulations was chosen in order to ensure that the position of the outer \n\nboundaries did not compromise the CFD solution. \n\nThe computational domain was 2.40 x 2.40 x 1.20 m and the internal measured barn \n\nmodel area was 1.20 x 1.33 m. The airflow data in the CBP barn is much more important \n\nthan that of the external area, but the adjacent area of the CBP barn is also very critical to \n\n\n\n200\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nmake a reliable air velocity distribution around the structure. To effectively the total mesh \n\nnumbers, the dense meshes should be located in the CBP barn model and the mesh size had \n\nto be designed gradually bigger as with distance from the CBP barn. The study also found \n\nthat it was very critical not to make a big and sudden change of mesh size between adjacent \n\nmeshes. It was assumed that the mesh quality including density and shape around the \n\nexternal surface of the CBP barn model affected the external airflow and air pressure \n\ndistribution of the CBP barn, which greatly influenced the natural ventilation. Details about \n\nrefinement of the computational tetrahedral mesh can be seen in Figure 4.107. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.107 - Refinement detail of the computational tetrahedral mesh. \n\n \n\n4.4.2. Validation of reduced model and simulations \n\nFigures 4.108 to 4.115 shows the values of the average standard errors for the variables \n\nstudied (air velocity and temperature) for all treatments tested (Closed ridge - CLR; Open \n\nridge - OPR; Open ridge with chimney - ORC; Elevated ridge - ELR; and Overshot ridge - \n\nOVR) in each section and three different heights of data collection. \n\nThe simulations were performed to validate the CFD model and showed that the \n\naverage standard errors between the simulated and measured values for air velocity in all \n\ntreatments tested, using an air speed of 0.1 m s-1, wind direction south to north, and three \n\ndifferent heights, were 0.02 m s-1 (\u00b1 0.01), 0.02 m s-1 (\u00b1 0.01), 0.01 m s-1 (\u00b1 0.01), 0.01 m \n\ns-1 (\u00b1 0.01), and 0.02 m s-1 (\u00b1 0.01), respectively. Thus, the average standard errors for air \n\n\n\n201\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ntemperature were 0.22\u00b0C (\u00b1 0.17), 0.65\u00b0C (\u00b1 0.74), 0.74\u00b0C (\u00b1 0.54), 0.08\u00b0C (\u00b1 0.88), and \n\n0.82\u00b0C (\u00b1 0.91), respectively (see Figure 4.108). However, testing the other condition (air \n\nspeed of 1.0 m s-1), the highest the average standard errors between the simulated and \n\nmeasured values for air velocity and temperature values were 0.09 m s-1 (\u00b1 0.12) and \n\n0.93\u00b0C (\u00b1 0.71), respectively, as can be seen in Figure 4.109. \n\nThe highest average standard errors between the simulated and measured values for air \n\nvelocity (0.02 m s-1 \u00b1 0.01) and temperature (0.95\u00b0C \u00b1 1.01), using air speed of 0.1 m s-1 \n\nand wind direction of north to south  (perpendicular to ridge) were found in treatment \n\nORC, see Figure 4.110. Thus, using the other air speed (1.0 m s-1), the highest average \n\nstandard errors between the simulated and measured values for air velocity and temperature \n\nwere 0.13 m s-1 (\u00b1 0.10) and 1.17\u00b0C (\u00b1 1.12), respectively (see Figure 4.111).  \n\nThe average standard error between simulated and measured air velocity and \n\ntemperature, using air speed of 0.1 m s-1and wind direction of east to west were 0.01 m s-1 \n\nwith a range from 0.00 to 0.03 m s-1, and 1.13\u00b0C with a range from 0.05 to 3.35\u00b0C, \n\nrespectively (see Figure 4.112). To other air speed tested (1.0 m s-1), the average standard \n\nerror between simulated and measured air velocity and temperature were 0.23 m s-1 with a \n\nrange from 0.00 to 0.47 m s-1, and 0.85\u00b0C with a range from 0.05 to 3.05\u00b0C, respectively \n\n(see Figure 4.113). \n\nThe highest the average standard errors between simulated and measured values were \n\n0.01 m s-1 (\u00b1 0.01) for air velocity and 0.72\u00b0C (\u00b1 0.58) for temperature, using air speed of \n\n0.1 m s-1and wind direction of west to east (Figure 4.114). However, using air speed (1.0 m \n\ns-1), the highest average standard error between simulated and measured variables studied \n\nwere 0.18 m s-1 (\u00b1 0.06) and 0.78\u00b0C (\u00b1 0.37) for these treatments tested (see Figure 4.115). \n\n \n\n\n\n202\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n(a) (b) (c) \n\n(d) (e) (f) \n\nFigure 4.108 - Average air velocity (a, b, and c) and temperature (d, e, and f) standard errors for air speed of 0.1 m s-1, and wind \ndirection of south to north, at nine locations and three different heights: (a and d) 0.02 m, (b and e) 0.11 m, and (c \nand f) 0.20 m.

In this case, the average absolute deviation 0.90 \u00b1 0.27 and 0.73 \u00b1 0.07, \n\nrespectively. \n\nGiven that the absolute average errors calculated between the values of air velocities \n\nand temperature measured and simulated are very close to or less than 0.41 m s-1 and \n\n2.29\u00b0C, respectively, the accuracy values of the anemometer (\u00b10.01 m s-1) and thermometer \n\n(\u00b11.0\u00b0C) and that the magnitude of these errors would have little influence on the final \n\nresult for the calculation of the variables studied.

Applying various scenarios and  allowing the simulation to \n\naid in the understanding the whole system. \n\nFigures 4.128 to 4.135 shows the simulated air velocity vectors and temperature \n\ndistribution vertically and on the surface of the floor in CBP barn equipped with closed \n\nridge (CLR).  \n\nFigures 4.128a and 4.128b showed that the air entered the CBP barn through the ridge \n\nopening at one side, and then exited through the sidewall opening located at the other side.  \n\nSo, the air flow velocity was reduced due to presence of the wall and fences on both side of \n\nthe barn. It resulted in a internal vortex at the center of the feed alley and compost area.  \n\nIn the Figure 4.129, one can observe the effect of cooling the compost surface area near \n\nthe alleyway. From the Figure 4.131, the higher surface temperature in the center of the \n\ncompost area (after down flow from wall) is due to a reduced air velocity which results in \n\nlower cooling in this area. Figures 4.132 to 4.135 shows the simulated results of air \n\nvelocity and surface temperature on the compost area, when predominant winds enter the \n\ninstallation at east to west and west to east. At the Figures 4.132 and 4.134, it can be seen \n\nthat there is a considerable variation in the direction of the air velocity vectors. Inside of \n\nthe trusses structure, it can be seen that the main flow tends to turn opposite the main wind \n\ndirection.  \n\nIn Figures 4.133 and 4.135, it can be seen observed that the vortex of the airflow \n\npromoted the worst conditions of air circulation and the surfaces temperature of the \n\ncompost area were higher on the both sides of the barn. \n\nThe air velocity distribution in a vertical plan situated in the center of the barn allows \n\nus to determine the inside air speed more precisely. Figure 4.136 shows the air velocity \n\ndistribution in a vertical plan situated in the center of the CBP barn equipped with closed \n\nridge (CLR) in four wind direction. As evidenced in Figure 4.136, the higher air velocity \n\nvalues was observed near to the compost area in east and west winds. However, in the near \n\nridge region, both these winds direction failed to perform well with air velocity values \n\naround 0.1 m s-1. Outside air velocity values were higher in south and north wind \n\ndirections. This aspect coincides with that of other studies performed by Norton et al. \n\n(2010b), Majdoubi et al. (2009), Lee et al. (2007), and Koenig et al. (1978). \n\n \n\n\n\n230\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n(a) \n\n(b) \nFigure 4.128 - Air velocity (a) and temperature (b) distribution vertically in the CBP barn \n\nequipped with closed ridge (CLR) and wind direction of south to north. \n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.129 - Air temperature distribution on the surface of the floor inside the CBP barn \n\nequipped with closed ridge (CLR) and wind direction of south to north. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWind\u00a0direction\u00a0\n\n\n\n231\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n(a) \n\n(b) \nFigure 4.130 - Air velocity (a) and temperature (b) distribution vertically in the CBP barn \n\nequipped with closed ridge (CLR) and wind direction of north to south. \n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.131 - Air temperature distribution on the surface of the floor inside the CBP barn \n\nequipped with closed ridge (CLR) and wind direction of north to south. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWind\u00a0direction\u00a0\n\n\n\n232\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n(a) \n\n(b) \nFigure 4.132 - Air velocity (a) and temperature (b) distribution vertically in the CBP barn \n\nequipped with closed ridge (CLR) and wind direction of east to west. \n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.133 - Air temperature distribution on the surface of the floor inside the CBP barn \n\nequipped with closed ridge (CLR) and wind direction of east to west. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWind\u00a0direction\u00a0\n\n\n\n233\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n(a) \n\n(b) \nFigure 4.134 - Air velocity (a) and temperature (b) distribution vertically in the CBP barn \n\nequipped with closed ridge (CLR) and wind direction of west to east. \n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.135 - Air temperature distribution on the surface of the floor inside the CBP barn \n\nequipped with closed ridge (CLR) and wind direction of west to east. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWind\u00a0direction\u00a0\n\n\n\n234\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nFigure 4.136 - Profile of mean horizontal wind speed in the centre of the CBP barn \nequipped with closed ridge (CLR) in four wind direction. \n\n \nFigures 4.137 to 4.145 shows the simulated results of CBP barn equipped with open \n\nridge (OPR) in four wind direction.  \n\nAccording to the Figures 4.137 and 4.139, these barns produced higher ridge vent flows \n\nfor the south and north wind directions at wind velocities above 0.07 m s-1. Wind direction \n\ncomparisons indicated that south winds consistently produced the highest ridge vents flows \n\n(Figure 137a), however the east and west generated lowest ridge vent flows (Figures \n\n4.141a and 4.143a). Since wind direction had a large influence on ridge vent flow, building \n\norientation with respect to wind direction should be considered in the design of naturally \n\nventilated, open ridge, assuming the reduced model exhibit similar airflow characteristics.  \n\nFigures 4.141 and 4.143 shown the reduction of air velocity inside the trusses structure. \n\nIt can be seen that the main flow tends to turn opposite the main wind direction. Highest \n\nvalues of temperature on the surface of the compost area were observed with wind \n\ndirection of north (Figure 4.140). By comparison, wind direction of east and west shown \n\nthe lowest values of surface temperature on the compost area (Figures 4.142 and 4.144, \n\nrespectively). \n\nFigure 4.145 shows the air velocity distribution in a vertical plan situated in the centre \n\nof the CBP barn equipped with open ridge (OPR) in four wind direction. Examination of \n\nthe air velocity inside the barn above the compost area surface, demonstrates that the \n\nvalues are very close at 0.2 m height from ground. However, one can remark that the air \n\nvelocity values in south and north winds directions rapid increase at ridge area. \n\n\n\n235\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n(a) \n\n(b) \nFigure 4.137 - Air velocity (a) and temperature (b) distribution vertically in the CBP barn \n\nequipped with open ridge (OPR) and wind direction of south to north. \n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.138 - Air temperature distribution on the surface of the floor inside the CBP barn \n\nequipped with open ridge (OPR) and wind direction of south to north. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWind\u00a0direction\u00a0\n\n\n\n236\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n(a) \n\n(b) \nFigure 4.139 - Air velocity (a) and temperature (b) distribution vertically in the CBP barn \n\nequipped with open ridge (OPR) and wind direction of north to south. \n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.140 - Air temperature distribution on the surface of the floor inside the CBP barn \n\nequipped with open ridge (OPR) and wind direction of north to south. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWind\u00a0direction\u00a0\n\n\n\n237\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n(a) \n\n(b) \nFigure 4.141 - Air velocity (a) and temperature (b) distribution vertically in the CBP barn \n\nequipped with open ridge (OPR) and wind direction of east to west. \n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.142 - Air temperature distribution on the surface of the floor inside the CBP barn \n\nequipped with open ridge (OPR) and wind direction of east to west. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWind\u00a0direction\u00a0\n\n\n\n238\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n(a) \n\n(b) \nFigure 4.143 - Air velocity (a) and temperature (b) distribution vertically in the CBP barn \n\nequipped with open ridge (OPR) and wind direction of west to east. \n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.144 - Air temperature distribution on the surface of the floor inside the CBP barn \n\nequipped with open ridge (OPR) and wind direction of west to east. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWind\u00a0direction\u00a0\n\n\n\n239\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nFigure 4.145 - Profile of mean horizontal wind speed in the centre of the CBP barn \nequipped with open ridge (OPR) in four wind direction. \n\n \nFigures 4.146 to 4.153 shows the simulated results of CBP barn equipped with open \n\nridge with chimney (ORC) in four wind direction. Figures 4.146 and 4.148 show \n\nconsiderable variation in the direction of the air velocity vectors, and consequently the flow \n\nis far from being two-dimensional. Near the ridge opening, it can be seen that center of \n\nturbulence is located above the roof in the right (Figure 4.146a) and left (Figure 4146b) \n\nside. From the Figure 4.148a, the north wind direction, which produced the highest ridge \n\nvent flows, also generated high air velocities inside the structure. So, the contour plot of the \n\nvalue of the vertical component of wind speed which is also shown in Figures 4.146 and \n\n4.148 reveals periodic air circulation loops due to buoyancy forces with horizontal axes \n\nwhich develop perpendicularly to the wind. \n\nDistribution of surface temperature on the compost area are represented in Figures \n\n4.147, 4.149, 4.151, and 4.153. It can be observed that the distribution temperature on the \n\ncompost area in wind direction north (Figure 4.149) is more uniform than east (Figure \n\n4.151) and west (Figure 4.153). This result can be explained by the fact that the air velocity \n\ndistribution is almost uniform in near entire compost area. In contrast, when the wind \n\ndirection were east and west, the air movement tends to stabilize, generating lower air \n\nvelocity above the compost area. Figure 4.154 shows the air velocity distribution in a \n\nvertical plan situated in the center of the CBP barn equipped with open ridge with chimney \n\n(ORC) in four wind direction. The air velocity value above the compost area is lower in \n\nsouth and north wind direction due to drag effect of the sidewall and sidewall planks. The \n\nair velocity values were lower near ridge opening in east and west wind direction.  \n\n\n\n240\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n   \n(a) \n\n(b) \nFigure 4.146 - Air velocity (a) and temperature (b) distribution vertically in the CBP barn \n\nequipped with open ridge with chimney (ORC) and wind direction of south. \n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.147 - Air temperature distribution on the surface of the floor inside the CBP barn \n\nequipped with open ridge with chimney (ORC) and wind direction of south \nto north. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWind\u00a0direction\u00a0\n\n\n\n241\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n(a) \n\n(b) \nFigure 4.148 - Air velocity (a) and temperature (b) distribution vertically in the CBP barn \n\nequipped with open ridge with chimney (ORC) and wind direction of north \nto south. \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.149 - Air temperature distribution on the surface of the floor inside the CBP barn \n\nequipped with open ridge with chimney (ORC) and wind direction of north \nto south. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWind\u00a0direction\u00a0\n\n\n\n242\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n(a) \n\n(b) \nFigure 4.150 - Air velocity (a) and temperature (b) distribution vertically in the CBP barn \n\nequipped with open ridge with chimney (ORC) and wind direction of east to \nwest. \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.151 - Air temperature distribution on the surface of the floor inside the CBP barn \n\nequipped with open ridge with chimney (ORC) and wind direction of east to \nwest. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWind\u00a0direction\u00a0\n\n\n\n243\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n(a) \n\n(b) \nFigure 4.152 - Air velocity (a) and temperature (b) distribution vertically in the CBP barn \n\nequipped with open ridge with chimney (ORC) and wind direction of west \nto east. \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.153 - Air temperature distribution on the surface of the floor inside the CBP barn \n\nequipped with open ridge with chimney (ORC) and wind direction of west \nto east. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWind\u00a0direction\u00a0\n\n\n\n244\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nFigure 4.154 - Profile of mean horizontal wind speed in the centre of the CBP barn \nequipped with open ridge with chimney (ORC) in four wind direction. \n\n \nFigures 4.155 to 4.162 shows the simulated results of CBP barn equipped with elevated \n\nridge (ELR) in four wind direction. The higher ridge vent outlet flow was visualized in \n\nCBP barn equipped with ELR ridge type using east and west winds direction (Figure \n\n4.155a and 4.157a). The wind flows up the windward wall surface and above the roof of \n\nthe barns with east and west winds (Figures 4.159a and 4.161a) but hits the roof inside the \n\nbarn with south and north winds (see Figures 4.155a and 4.157a). In addition, a lower \n\npressure area is created above the roof in the east and west winds than above the south and \n\nnorth winds, thereby generating higher ridge opening flows. \n\nFigures 4.155b, 4.157b, 4.159b, and 4.161b represents the air temperature distribution \n\nvertically by convection and Figures 4.156, 4.158, 4.160, and 4.162 shown the temperature \n\ndistribution on the surface of the compost area. The worst uniformity in surface \n\ntemperature was observed in compost area tested with north wind direction (Figures 4.158) \n\nin relation to other winds direction, which may be due to the fact that air flux over the \n\ncompost area is less uniform. \n\nFigure 4.163 shows the air velocity distribution in a vertical plan situated in the center \n\nof the CBP barn equipped with elevated ridge (ELR) in four wind direction.  In general, \n\nthis shows that the average air speed in the space between the top of the compost area and \n\nthe barn roof is approximately half that of the outside wind, for all wind directions. Air \n\nvelocity is much lower inside the barn than outside and its flows through ridge opening \n\nsystematically higher in south and north wind directions. \n\n \n\n\n\n245\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n(a) \n\n(b) \nFigure 4.155 - Air velocity (a) and temperature (b) distribution vertically in the CBP barn \n\nequipped with elevated ridge (ELR) and wind direction of south to north. \n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.156 - Air temperature distribution on the surface of the floor inside the CBP barn \n\nequipped with elevated ridge (ELR) and wind direction of south to north. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\nWind\u00a0direction\u00a0\n\n\n\n246\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n(a) \n\n(b) \nFigure 4.157 - Air velocity (a) and temperature (b) distribution vertically in the CBP barn \n\nequipped with elevated ridge (ELR) and wind direction of north to south. \n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.158 - Air temperature distribution on the surface of the floor inside the CBP barn \n\nequipped with elevated ridge (ELR) and wind direction of north to south. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\nWind\u00a0direction\u00a0\n\n\n\n247\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n(a) \n\n(b) \nFigure 4.159 - Air velocity (a) and temperature (b) distribution vertically in the CBP barn \n\nequipped with elevated ridge (ELR) and wind direction of east to west. \n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.160 - Air temperature distribution on the surface of the floor inside the CBP barn \n\nequipped with elevated ridge (ELR) and wind direction of east to west. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWind\u00a0direction\u00a0\n\n\n\n248\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n(a) \n\n(b) \nFigure 4.161 - Air velocity (a) and temperature (b) distribution vertically in the CBP barn \n\nequipped with elevated ridge (ELR) and wind direction of west to east. \n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.162 - Air temperature distribution on the surface of the floor inside the CBP barn \n\nequipped with elevated ridge (ELR) and wind direction of west to east. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\nWind\u00a0direction\u00a0\n\n\n\n249\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nFigure 4.163 - Profile of mean horizontal wind speed in the centre of the CBP barn \nequipped with open ridge with chimney (ORC) in four wind direction. \n\n \nFigures 4.164 to 4.171 shows a representation of air velocity vectors, and temperature \n\ndistribution vertically and on the surface of the floor when overshot ridge (OVR) was \n\nequipped in four wind direction, respectably.  \n\nThe turbulence of the airflow formed above the roof in simulated barn with south winds \n\n(Figure 4.164a) is smaller than simulated barn with north winds (Figure 4.166a). Therefore, \n\nas can be seen in Figures 4.168a and 4.170a, the turbulence zone was situated after barn at \n\nwindward gable wall height in simulated barn with east and west winds. The south and \n\nnorth winds direction created the lowest air velocity values differences (Figures 4.164 and \n\n4.166) and east and west winds produced the highest air velocity values differences \n\n(Figures 4.168 and 4.170). Airflow enters through both sides the opening wall and owing to \n\ndensity differences between the inside and outside air, immediately drops to the floor. This \n\nairflow then travels toward the center of the building, heating up as it passes over the \n\ncompost area before it eventually rises (see Figures 4.164 and 4.166). A similar observation \n\nhas already been reported by Norton et al. (2010a). \n\nThe highest surface temperature distribution differences on compost area was observed \n\nin the east and west winds direction (Figures 4.169 and 4.171). The lowest surface \n\ntemperature differences on compost area was generally noted south winds (Figure 4.165). \n\nFigure 4.172 shows the air velocity distribution in a vertical plan situated in the center \n\nof the CBP barn equipped with overshot ridge (OVR) in four wind direction. The air \n\nvelocity show approximately the same values at 0.02 m above the compost area for all \n\nwinds direction tested, but values strongly decreases near the ridge opening in the east and \n\nwest winds direction, then increases progressively from the ridge opening. \n\n\n\n250\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n(a) \n\n(b) \nFigure 4.164 - Air velocity (a) and temperature (b) distribution vertically in the CBP barn \n\nequipped with overshot ridge (OVR) and wind direction of south to north. \n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.165 - Air temperature distribution on the surface of the floor inside the CBP barn \n\nequipped with overshot ridge (OVR) and wind direction of south to north. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWind\u00a0direction\u00a0\n\n\n\n251\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n(a) \n\n(b) \nFigure 4.166 - Air velocity (a) and temperature (b) distribution vertically in the CBP barn \n\nequipped with overshot ridge (OVR) and wind direction of north to south. \n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.167 - Air temperature distribution on the surface of the floor inside the CBP barn \n\nequipped with overshot ridge (OVR) and wind direction of north to south. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWind\u00a0direction\u00a0\n\n\n\n252\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n(a) \n\n(b) \nFigure 4.168 - Air velocity (a) and temperature (b) distribution vertically in the CBP barn \n\nequipped with overshot ridge (OVR) and wind direction of east to west. \n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.169 - Air temperature distribution on the surface of the floor inside the CBP barn \n\nequipped with overshot ridge (OVR) and wind direction of east to west. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWind\u00a0direction\u00a0\n\n\n\n253\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n(a) \n\n(b) \nFigure 4.170 - Air velocity (a) and temperature (b) distribution vertically in the CBP barn \n\nequipped with overshot ridge (OVR) and wind direction of west to east. \n \n\n(a) (b) \nFigure 4.171 - Air temperature distribution on the surface of the floor inside the CBP barn \n\nequipped with overshot ridge (OVR) and wind direction of west to east. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWind\u00a0direction\u00a0\n\n\n\n254\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \nFigure 4.172 - Profile of mean horizontal wind speed in the centre of the CBP barn \n\nequipped with overshot ridge (OVR) in four wind direction. \n \n\nOverall, one can summarise the complex airflow as follows:  \n\na) In general, wind direction indicates that air would approximately move along the \n\nlength of the barns as opposed to the width or across the barn. The ridge openings \n\nnoticeably increased the inside air velocities for all the wind directions studied except for \n\nthe east and west direction. However, in this case, low air velocities were observed inside \n\nthe trusses structure and near the ridge opening; \n\nb) The airflow patterns were visually higher in all ridge openings tested with wind \n\ndirection of south and north. With east and west winds higher airflows were observed in the \n\nwindward ends of the ridge vents than was noted downwind. The airflow patterns for east \n\nand west winds also showed that inside the trusses structure the air generally flowed in the \n\nopposite direction of the outside winds. With a south and north wind the inside airflow near \n\nthe trusses structures were generally in the same direction as the outside air. South and \n\nnorth winds produced a swirling action inside the all CFD models with most of the air \n\nexiting from the opening wall. This condition was probably due to a slight difference in the \n\noutside airflow; \n\nc) CBP barn model geometry effects the surface temperature difference on compost \n\narea were visibly significant through the air temperature distribution on the surface of the \n\nfloor inside the CBP barns in the previous figures for all ridge opening tested and direction \n\nof the wind; and \n\nd) Air loops fed by buoyancy forces due to the inside air temperature differences \n\ndevelop perpendicularly between the top of the compost area and bottom of the roof vent \n\nopenings. \n\n\n\n255\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n4.4.4.2. Evaluation of the types of ridge vents and wind direction \n\nMaintaining active composting in a compost bedded pack barn is a real challenge \n\nduring the winter months. It becomes difficult to start or restart a compost bedded pack \n\nbarn in winter with low bacterial activity since heat losses can easily exceed heat \n\ngenerated. Because of this, to select the best condition of ventilation in the winter weather \n\nwith reduced cooling of the surface of the bed, the CFD models were evaluated in function \n\nof five types of ridge vents (CLR, OPR, ORC, ELR, and OVR) and four wind direction \n\n(North, South, East, and West) to promote greater percentage heated surfaces of the floor. \n\nThe analyzes of variance for variables five types of ridge vents and four wind direction \n\nin function of percentage of heated floor area are showing in Table 4.19.

These results showed that the best ridge vent and wind \n\ndirection in the winter weather was observed in the open ridge with chimney (ORC) and \n\nWest to East, respectively. Therefore, open ridge with chimney (ORC) positioned from \n\nWest to East can possibly be the best barn design with better efficiency among those barns \n\nwho were studied. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n257\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n5 - CONCLUSION \n\nThe following conclusions were drawn based on the experimental study of 42 compost \n\nbedded pack (CBP) barns in Kentucky: \n\n \na) Overall, dairies producers visited in Kentucky were very satisfied with their compost \n\nbarns. They observed that cows were more comfortable and that this housing system \n\nresulted in increased cow cleanliness. The compost bedding pack (CBP) barns in \n\nKentucky of this study had a variety of building designs. Majority of these barns had \n\nfeed alleys and driveways. Most frequent barn orientation was NE to SW.  The primary \n\ntypes of barn ridge found in the barns were overshot ridges. Most of barns had roof pitch \n\nof 4:12. The majority of barns was equipped with box fans. Air temperatures tended to \n\nbe lower indoor the barns which utilized overshot or capped ridge, forced ventilation \n\nsystem and ridge direction of SW or NW. The average relative humidity in this study \n\nwas approximately 65.0%. In general, wind direction was approximately transverse to \n\nthe barns length direction and the air velocity was 1.0 m s-1. In addition, air quality and \n\npossible dust issues in compost dairy barns need to be evaluated. \n\n \nb) The bedding materials more used in the CBP barns was kild-dried sawdust. However, \n\nmost dairies producers preferred to use green sawdust rather than the kild-dried sawdust, \n\nbecause this material was harmful or beneficial to the composting bed. Moreover, green \n\nsawdust was not absorb as much water as kiln-dried sawdust. Pack temperatures \n\nindicated that some of the bedding materials were not able to support microbial activity \n\nand produce heat. Average Pack moisture content was 59.0% (\u00b1 9.0) wet basis. Our \n\nobservations indicate moisture content should be between 40-60%. Most of the barns in \n\nKentucky had their compost aerated to a depth below 0.25 m, twice a day in the summer \n\nand winter time, while cows were away at the parlor, most often using a chisel plow on a \n\nsmall tractor. Bedding management is critical to encourage microbial activity, minimize \n\npathogen exposure, and maintain cow cleanliness. Further research is necessary \n\nregarding the effect of different climatic conditions on the composting processes. \n\n \nc) A comparison of the particle weight fraction distributions content reveals that these \n\nbedding compost materials found in CBP barns are very different. The results indicated \n\nthat the distribution of mass weight increased in the order of Coarser to Finer. The \n\n\n\n258\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\naverage finer index expressed as weight percent in the samples studied was 30.1%, \n\nimplying excessive water retention and low aeration.  \n\n \nd) Generally, some compost bedding materials showed high particle density (? 1g cm-3) \n\ncompared with other materials. Indeed, these values were higher than expected, but can \n\nlikely be tied to the presence of carbonates and other inorganic media such as soil \n\nparticles contained within the compost samples. The higher bulk density value was 3.6 \n\ntimes that of the lower bulk density value. This investigation also showed that porosity \n\nis potentially dependent (reverse order) on bulk density although the statistical \n\nsignificance of this relation was high. \n\n \ne) Water Holding Capacity (WHC) increases with increasingly fine particle size. Coarse \n\nparticle size of compost have a lower WHC since they are high in large pores subject to \n\nfree drainage. Fine particle size have a greater occurrence of small pores that hold water \n\nagainst free drainage, resulting in a higher WHC values. In this study, WHC increased \n\nwith increasing moisture content until certain level. Therefore, compost bedding \n\nmaterial with good physical and chemical properties helps to increase the WHC of \n\nbedding compost, reduces natural drainage and runoff of the moisture (urine and faeces) \n\nthrough surface of compost, and consequently improves their moisture content. Further \n\nresearch is needed to investigate the influence of moisture content measurement on the \n\ndetermination of WHC. \n\n \nf)  Pack chemical characteristics were almost similar to all bedding materials. Thus, many \n\ndairy producers can use the bedding compost to fertilizer their crop fields and avoid \n\nover-applying nutrients and reduce water pollution. Bedding compost always contained \n\nbacterial, but the variation was large between different sampling sites and times. \n\nHowever, Coliforms was not present in barns that had a higher compost temperature. \n\nColiforms, E. Coli, Bacillus and Streptococcus count were higher in the barns that \n\nshowed lower moisture content.  \n\n \ng) Generally, the thermal conductivity increased with increasing particle size, while \n\nthermal resistivity decreased with increasing particle size. This behavior can probably \n\nbe explained by considering the higher moisture retention of larger particles once \n\ncompost materials were air dried at the same time. It could possibly have changed the \n\n\n\n259\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nvalues of the thermal properties. Thus, the tendency thermal conductivity as a function \n\nof particle size was very consistent at particle size below than 4.75 mm and  thermal \n\nresistivity showed an pronounced decrease in compost particle size between 4.75 and \n\n5.60 mm. Thus, results above indicate that the thermal properties are strongly dependent \n\non particle size.  However, further studies should be carried out to confirm their positive \n\neffects. \n\n \nh) In the present study, an increasing trend in the thermal conductivity of all compost \n\nmaterials was also observed with the increase in both moisture content and static and \n\ndynamic compaction degree for all compost material tested. In contrast, an increasing \n\ntrend in the thermal resistivity of bed compost was observed with the decrease in both \n\nmoisture content and static and dynamic compaction degree. The first order regression \n\nmodels developed in this study represent the relationship of degree of moisture content \n\nand static and dynamic compaction versus thermal conductivity and thermal resistivity \n\nas well. The resulting thermal properties of compost bedding materials can be used to \n\ndevelop heat transfer models for the design of more optimal temperature control in \n\ncompost bedding pack systems. \n\n \ni)  A 3-D CFD model was established to graphically show the air velocity and temperature \n\ndistribution in a CBP barns using different ridge vents opening with natural ventilation. \n\nThe developed model provided good agreement with experimental measurements and it \n\nwas able to identify the impact on air flow through structure in a CBP barns. To date \n\nmost published works on CFD simulation for dairy building have been 2-D, and only \n\nventilation has been modeled with 3-D CFD. We hope this developed model can \n\ncontribute to the optimum design for CBP barn construction. It should also provide \n\nguidelines for modifying existing CBP barns towards more uniform and optimum \n\ntemperature and air movement distribution, thus increasing air quality and cow comfort. \n\nResearch employing this model or other models with similar characteristics is needed to \n\nsimulate more accurately the effect on air flow through structure in CBP barns with \n\ndairy cows. These results showed that the best ridge vent and wind direction in the \n\nwinter weather was ORC positioned from West to East can possibly be the best barn \n\ndesign with better efficiency among those barns who were studied. \n\n \n\n\n\n260\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n6 - REFERENCES \n \n\nABU-HAMDEH, N.
