Em 2001, a \n\nVALE S.A. deu in\u00edcio a um projeto de explora\u00e7\u00e3o com foco em Elementos do Grupo da \n\nPlatina (EGP) na regi\u00e3o da Serra Leste, Caraj\u00e1s. Este trabalho apresenta a primeira \n\ndescri\u00e7\u00e3o sistem\u00e1tica do Complexo Luanga e seu dep\u00f3sito de EGP, desenvolvida com o \n\naux\u00edlio das extensiva base de dados gerada pela VALE. \n\n Neste cen\u00e1rio, esta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o objetiva entender a g\u00eanese e evolu\u00e7\u00e3o geol\u00f3gica \n\ndo Complexo Luanga e seus diferentes estilos de mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o de EGP. Para isso \n\nforam realizados trabalhos de campo, mapeamento geol\u00f3gico, descri\u00e7\u00e3o e amostragem \n\nde testemunhos de sondagem, interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o de se\u00e7\u00e3o de sondagem, interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ndados de geoqu\u00edmica, petrografia \u00f3ptica, qu\u00edmica de min\u00e9rio, qu\u00edmica mineral, \n\nimageamento em microsc\u00f3pio eletr\u00f4nico de varredura (MEV) e an\u00e1lises qu\u00edmicas \n\nisot\u00f3picas de is\u00f3topos de Sm, Nd e S.  \n\n O Complexo Luanga \u00e9 parte da su\u00edte magm\u00e1tica Serra Leste, localizada na \n\npor\u00e7\u00e3o nordeste da Prov\u00edncia Mineral de Caraj\u00e1s. O Complexo Luanga \u00e9 uma intrus\u00e3o \n\nde m\u00e9dio porte, que pode ser dividida em tr\u00eas zonas principais: i. Zona Ultram\u00e1fica, \n\nlocalizada na por\u00e7\u00e3o inferior da intrus\u00e3o, composta por cumulados ultram\u00e1ficos \n\n(peridotitos), ii. Zona de Transi\u00e7\u00e3o, localizada na por\u00e7\u00e3o central da intrus\u00e3o, composta \n\npor uma intercala\u00e7\u00e3o de cumulados ultram\u00e1ficos e m\u00e1ficos (harzburgito, piroxenito, \n\nnorito) e iii. Zona M\u00e1fica, localizada na por\u00e7\u00e3o superior da intrus\u00e3o, composta por uma \n\nsequ\u00eancia mon\u00f3tona de cumulados m\u00e1ficos (noritos) com intercala\u00e7\u00f5es pontuais de \n\nortopiroxenito. A Zona Ultram\u00e1fica sobrep\u00f5e a Zona de Transi\u00e7\u00e3o, que sobrep\u00f5e a Zona \n\nM\u00e1fica, sugerindo assim que o complexo est\u00e1 tectonicamente invertido. A mineralogia \n\nprim\u00e1ria dos cumulados citados \u00e9 frequentemente substitu\u00edda em resposta a uma \n\ntransforma\u00e7\u00e3o metam\u00f3rfica heterog\u00eanea sobreposta. Apesar da recristaliza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nmineral\u00f3gica, a transforma\u00e7\u00e3o metam\u00f3rfica preserva as texturas e dom\u00ednios \n\ncomposicionais das rochas magm\u00e1ticas.  \n\nDiferentes estilos de mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o de EGP ocorrem ao longo do Complexo \n\nLuanga, com o destaque para ocorr\u00eancias associadas a sulfetos disseminados e \n\nocorr\u00eancias sem associa\u00e7\u00e3o clara com sulfetos e/ou cromititos. O primeiro caso \u00e9 \n\nilustrado por um horizonte de 10-50 metros de espessura, localizado na passagem entre \n\n\n\n \n\niv \n \n\nas Zonas Ultram\u00e1fica e de Transi\u00e7\u00e3o, com uma dissemina\u00e7\u00e3o de sulfetos (i.e. 3% vol.) \n\ndenominado Sulfide Zone. A mineralogia dos sulfetos \u00e9 tipicamente pentlandita > \n\npirrotita >>> calcopirita, o que resulta em um elevado tenor de Ni (i.e. 16-18%) e alta \n\nraz\u00e3o Ni/Cu (i.e. 10-12). A Sulfide Zone hospeda a maior parte dos recursos de EGP do \n\ndep\u00f3sito de Luanga (i.e. 142 Mt@ 1.24g/t EGP+Au e 0.11% Ni).  O segundo estilo de \n\nmineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 definido por horizontes de 2-10 metros de espessura, \n\nestratigraficamente acima da Sulfide Zone, que apresentam concentra\u00e7\u00f5es an\u00f4malas de \n\nEGP, denominados silicate-related PGE. As rochas observadas nestes horizontes n\u00e3o \n\npossuem nenhuma caracter\u00edstica textural ou mineral\u00f3gica que as distinga dos cumulados \n\nsupracitados. Os dois estilos citados apresentam caracter\u00edsticas geoqu\u00edmicas distintas, \n\nquanto \u00e0s concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de EGP. A Sulfide Zone possui raz\u00f5es Pt/Pd de \n\naproximadamente 0.5 e um padr\u00e3o de EGP, normalizados ao manto primitivo, t\u00edpico de \n\ndep\u00f3sitos de sulfetos magm\u00e1ticos hospedados em intrus\u00f5es m\u00e1fica-ultram\u00e1ficas. O \n\nsilicate-related PGE possui raz\u00f5es Pt/Pd de aproximadamente 1.2-1.3 e forte deple\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nem Ir e Os. Outra caracter\u00edstica importante \u00e9 a ocorr\u00eancia de cristais de olivina com at\u00e9 \n\n7500 ppm de Ni em alguns harzburgitos que hospedam a mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o do tipo silicate-\n\nrelated PGE. Tais caracter\u00edsticas sugerem que os dois estilos s\u00e3o formados por \n\nprocessos geol\u00f3gicos distintos.  \n\n Cromititos estratiformes, com textura variada e espessura de at\u00e9 60 cent\u00edmetros, \n\nocorrem ao longo do Complexo Luanga, hospedados no topo da Zona de Transi\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nbase da Zona M\u00e1fica. Em fun\u00e7\u00e3o do extensivo processo de metamorfismo que afeta as \n\nrochas do Complexo Luanga, as composi\u00e7\u00f5es dos cristais de cromita s\u00e3o modificadas. \n\nA altera\u00e7\u00e3o da composi\u00e7\u00e3o prim\u00e1ria \u00e9 marcada em cristais zonados, com  Mg# \n\n(Mg/Mg+Fe\n2+\n\n) progressivamente menor do n\u00facleo para a borda. Estas altera\u00e7\u00f5es na \n\ncomposi\u00e7\u00e3o prim\u00e1ria de cristais de cromita comprometem sua aplicabilidade em estudos \n\npetrogen\u00e9ticos. Nossos resultados sugerem que estas fei\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o comuns em cromititos \n\nhospedados em rochas alteradas em outros locais no mundo. \n\n A composi\u00e7\u00e3o do magma parental do Complexo Luanga n\u00e3o pode ser obtida por \n\nm\u00e9todos diretos, aplicados a intrus\u00f5es bem expostas e preservadas (i.e. diques \n\ncorrelatos, margens de resfriamento, equivalentes extrusivos). Desta forma, a \n\ncomposi\u00e7\u00e3o do magma respons\u00e1vel pela gera\u00e7\u00e3o de olivinas extremamente ricas em Ni \n\ne horizontes ricos em EGP na intrus\u00e3o estudada, n\u00e3o \u00e9 \u00f3bvia. De fato, diferentes \n\nmodelos podem explicar a origem de magmas ricos em Ni e a exist\u00eancia ou n\u00e3o de \n\nmagmas f\u00e9rteis para a gera\u00e7\u00e3o de dep\u00f3sitos de EGP. Os resultados apresentados \n\n\n\n \n\nv \n \n\nsuportam a gera\u00e7\u00e3o de um magma rico em Ni que d\u00e1 origem ao Complexo Luanga e a \n\nexist\u00eancia de uma su\u00edte magm\u00e1tica f\u00e9rtil para a gera\u00e7\u00e3o de dep\u00f3sitos de EGP na por\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nleste da Prov\u00edncia Mineral de Caraj\u00e1s.   \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Intrus\u00e3o m\u00e1fica-ultram\u00e1fica; EGP; N\u00edquel; Cromitito; Dep\u00f3sito de \n\nsulfeto magm\u00e1tico; Caraj\u00e1s.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nvi \n \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\nSince 1983 the area of the Luanga Complex has been studied by different mining \n\ncompanies, aiming different commodities. In 2001, Vale S.A. started an exploration \n\nprogram for PGE in the Serra Leste region. This project resulted in a great volume of \n\ngeological data upon the layered intrusions and related mineralizations of the region. \n\nThis study provides the first systematic study of the Luanga Complex and its PGE \n\nmineralization supported by the extensive database provided by VALE.  \n\nBased on this scenario, the present dissertation aims the genesis and geological \n\nevolution of the Luanga Complex and its associated PGE mineralization. To achieve \n\nthis objective we performed field work, geological mapping and sampling, drill core \n\ndescription and sampling, reinterpretation of geological sections, detailed petrography, \n\nmineral chemistry, interpretation of lithogeochemical data, scanning electron \n\nmicroscope images (SEM) and isotopic analyses for Sm-Nd and S systematics.   \n\nThe Luanga Complex is part of the Serra Leste Magmatic Suite, located in the \n\nnortheastern portion of the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province. The Luanga Complex is a \n\nmedium-sized layered intrusion consisting of three main zones: i. the lower Ultramafic \n\nZone, comprising ultramafic cumulates (peridotite), ii. the Transition Zone comprising \n\ninterlayered ultramafic and mafic cumulates (harzburgite, orthopyroxenite and norite) \n\nand iii. the upper Mafic Zone comprising a monotonous sequence of mafic cumulates \n\n(norite) with minor orthopyroxenite layers. The Ultramafic Zone overlies the Transition \n\nZone, which overlies the Mafic Zone, suggesting thus that the layered sequence is \n\ntectonically overturned. Metamorphic assemblages commonly replace primary igneous \n\nminerals of the Luanga Complex. This metamorphic alteration is heterogeneous and \n\ncharacterized by an extensive hydration that largely preserves primary textures, bulk \n\nrock compositions and the compositional domains of igneous minerals. \n\nDifferent styles of PGE mineralization occur along the Luanga Complex, with \n\noccurrences associated with disseminated sulfides and occurrences with no clear \n\nassociation with sulfides and/or chromites. The first, ascribed as Sulfide Zone, consists \n\nof a 10 \u2013 50 m thick interval with disseminated sulfides located along the contact of the \n\nUltramafic and Transition Zones of the intrusion. The mineralogy of the Sulfide Zone \n\nconsists of base metal sulfides with pentlandite > pyrrhotite > >> chalcopyrite, resulting \n\nin high Ni tenors (i.e. 16-18) and high Ni/Cu ratios (i.e. 10-12). The Sulfide Zone hosts \n\n\n\n \n\nvii \n \n\nthe bulk of PGE resources of the Luanga Complex (i.e., 142 Mt at 1.24 ppm Pt+Pd+Au \n\nand 0.11% Ni). The other PGE mineralization, ascribed as silicate-related PGE, consists \n\nof 2-10 m thick stratabound zones across the Transition Zone. These sulfide- and \n\nchromite-free rocks, mainly harzburgite and orthopyroxenite, do not show any \n\ndistinctive texture or change in modal composition that characterize the PGE \n\nenrichment. The Sulfide Zone and silicate-related PGE show differences in \n\ngeochemistry behavior of PGE. The Sulfide Zone has Pt/Pd ratios of 0.5 and mantle-\n\nnormalized PGE patterns typical of magmatic sulfide deposits hosted in layered \n\nintrusions. The silicate-related PGE has Pt/Pd ratios of 1.2-1.3 and a strong depletion in \n\nIr and Os. A remarkable feature is the occurrence of anomalously Ni-rich olivines (up to \n\n7400 ppm Ni) in harzburgites closely associated with silicate-related PGE \n\nmineralization. The geochemical and textural differences between these mineralization \n\nstyles suggest that they were formed by distinct geological processes.  \n\n Several variable textured stratiform chromitites, up to 60 centimeters thick, \n\noccur in the upper portion of the Transition Zone and the lower portion of the Mafic \n\nZone. Due to the extensive metamorphic transformation overprinted over the Luanga \n\nComplex, the primary compositions of chromite crystal are extensively modified. \n\nAlteration of primary magmatic composition is indicated by zoned crystals with \n\nprogressively lower Mg# (Mg/Mg+Fe\n2+\n\n) from core to rim. Significant changes on \n\nprimary compositions of chromite identified in the Luanga Complex compromise their \n\napplication for petrogenetic studies. Our results suggest that these features should be \n\ncommon in chromitites hosted in altered rocks worldwide.  \n\nThe composition of the parental magma of the Luanga Complex cannot be \n\nconstrained by common approaches used to define their composition in well-exposed \n\nand well-preserved intrusions (e.g., chilled margin, bulk composition, extrusive \n\nequivalents, related dykes). Hence, the composition of the parental magma that leads the \n\nformation of Ni-rich olivines and PGE-rich horizons is not straightforward. Actually, \n\ndifferent models have been proposed to explain the origin of Ni-rich magmas and the \n\nexistence or not of PGE-fertile suites. The results of this study support the generation of \n\na Ni-rich magma that originates the Luanga Complex and the existence of a PGE-fertile \n\nsuite at the eastern portion of the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Mafic-ultramafic intrusion; PGE; Nickel; Chromitite; Magmatic sulfide \n\ndeposit; Caraj\u00e1s.  \n\n\n\n \n\nviii \n \n\nLista de Figuras \n\nFigura 1.1: A) Location of the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province.

Estes \n\ndep\u00f3sitos podem ser divididos em dois grupos principais, baseados na associa\u00e7\u00e3o destes \n\nEGP: i. dep\u00f3sitos de EGP associados a sulfetos e ii. dep\u00f3sitos de EGP associados a \n\ncromititos. Estes dois grupos podem ser ilustrados pelos dep\u00f3sitos de sulfetos Merensky \n\nreef, e cromititos do UG2, ambos localizados no Complexo de Bushveld, \u00c1frica do Sul \n\n(e.g., Barnes &amp; Maier, 2002; Cawthorn et al., 2002 e 2005; Naldrett, 2004). \n\n Alguns fatores podem justificar a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de recursos de EGP em poucas \n\nintrus\u00f5es. Destacam-se a elevada efici\u00eancia dos processos que concentram EGP e a \n\npossibilidade da exist\u00eancia de determinadas prov\u00edncias magm\u00e1ticas f\u00e9rteis em EGP. Ao \n\nque diz respeito aos processos de concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de EGP, estudos indicam processos \n\ngeol\u00f3gicos com uma efici\u00eancia de ordens de 10\n5 \n\n(Finnigan et al., 2008; Mungal &amp; \n\nNaldrett, 2008). Por outro lado, ao que condiz a exist\u00eancia ou n\u00e3o de uma prov\u00edncia \n\nmagm\u00e1tica f\u00e9rtil para a gera\u00e7\u00e3o de dep\u00f3sitos de EGP, tem-se um extenso debate. Alguns \n\nestudos prop\u00f5em a exist\u00eancia de prov\u00edncias que geram magmas de composi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ndistintas, que originam dep\u00f3sitos de Ni-Cu-PGE (e.g., Maier &amp; Groves, 2011; Griffin et \n\nal., 2013). Por outro lado, alguns autores afirmam que os dados obtidos em intrus\u00f5es \n\nestudadas ao redor do mundo n\u00e3o suportam a exist\u00eancia destas su\u00edtes f\u00e9rteis (e.g., \n\nFiorentini et al., 2010; Barnes et al., 2015). \n\n O Complexo Luanga faz parte da su\u00edte magm\u00e1tica Serra Leste (Ferreira Filho et \n\nal., 2007), localizada na por\u00e7\u00e3o nordeste da Prov\u00edncia Mineral de Caraj\u00e1s. Esta su\u00edte foi \n\ndefinida com base em concentra\u00e7\u00f5es an\u00f4malas de EGP. Desta forma, o estudo \n\nsistem\u00e1tico e entendimento da evolu\u00e7\u00e3o magm\u00e1tica do Complexo Luanga, assim como \n\nde outros complexos da regi\u00e3o (Teixeira et al., 2015) permitem entender quais os \n\nprincipais fatores que atuam na forma\u00e7\u00e3o de dep\u00f3sitos de EGP.  \n\n  Esta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o apresenta uma descri\u00e7\u00e3o sistem\u00e1tica do Complexo Luanga e \n\nmineraliza\u00e7\u00f5es associadas e visa contribuir com o entendimento de processos que levam \n\n\u00e0 concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de EGP. Adicionalmente, o trabalho faz uma caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o sistem\u00e1tica \n\nde cromititos que ocorrem ao longo do complexo e uma an\u00e1lise cr\u00edtica do efeito de \n\nprocessos de altera\u00e7\u00e3o p\u00f3s-magm\u00e1tica e metam\u00f3rfica na composi\u00e7\u00e3o de cristais de \n\ncromita. Tal an\u00e1lise cr\u00edtica pode ser extrapolada para o estudo de rochas ricas em \n\ncromita de outros complexos ultram\u00e1fico-m\u00e1ficos. Por fim, o trabalho destaca a \n\n\n\n \n\n2 \n \n\nimport\u00e2ncia de processos de concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de EGP sem uma associa\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00edpica a sulfetos \n\nmagm\u00e1ticos e/ou cromititos. Os resultado obtidos s\u00e3o comparados a dados da regi\u00e3o de \n\nCaraj\u00e1s e outros complexos m\u00e1fico-ultram\u00e1ficos do mundo, desta forma, o Complexo \n\nLuanga \u00e9 posicionado em um cen\u00e1rio global.   \n\n  \n\nOBJETIVO, PERGUNTAS E HIP\u00d3TESES \n\n \n\n Este trabalho tem por objetivo principal entender a g\u00eanese e evolu\u00e7\u00e3o geol\u00f3gica \n\ndo Complexo Luanga e seu dep\u00f3sito de Elementos do Grupo da Platina. \n\n \n\n Este objetivo visa responder as seguintes perguntas elaboradas dois anos atr\u00e1s e \n\ndurante o desenvolvimento da disserta\u00e7\u00e3o: \n\n \n\ni.

O Complexo Luanga apresenta a estrutura t\u00edpica de intrus\u00f5es m\u00e1fica-\n\nultram\u00e1ficas acamadas geradas por sucessivos pulsos magm\u00e1ticos, \n \n\nii.

The Luanga Complex is a medium-sized layered intrusion \n\nconsisting of three main zones: i. the lower Ultramafic Zone, comprising ultramafic \n\nadcumulates (peridotite), ii. the Transition Zone comprising interlayered ultramafic and \n\nmafic cumulates (harzburgite, orthopyroxenite and norite) and iii. the upper Mafic Zone \n\ncomprising a monotonous sequence of mafic cumulates (norite) with minor \n\northopyroxenite layers. Several PGE-mineralized zones occur in the Transition Zone but \n\nthe bulk of the PGE resources are hosted within a 10 \u2013 50 meters thick interval of \n\ndisseminated sulfides at the contact of the Ultramafic and Transition zones. The \n\ncompositional range of cumulus olivine (Fo78.9-86.4) is comparable to those reported for \n\nlayered intrusions originated from moderate primitive parental magmas. Mantle \n\nnormalized alteration-resistant trace element profiles of noritic rocks are fractionated, as \n\nindicated by relative enrichment in LREE and Th, with negative Nb and Ta anomalies, \n\nsuggesting assimilation of older continental crust. Ni contents in olivine in the Luanga \n\nComplex (up to 7,500 ppm) stand among the highest values reported in layered \n\nintrusions globally. The highest Ni contents in olivine in the Luanga Complex occur in \n\ndistinctively PGE enriched (Pt+Pd > 1 ppm) intervals of the Transition Zone, in both \n\nsulfide-poor and sulfide bearing (1-3 vol.% ) rocks. The origin of the PGE- and Ni-rich \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n \n\nparental magma of the Luanga Complex is discussed considering the upgrading of \n\nmagmas through dissolution of previously formed Ni-rich sulfide melts. Our results \n\nsuggest that high Ni contents in olivine and/or orthopyroxene provide an additional \n\nexploration tool for Ni-PGE deposits, particularly useful for target selection in large \n\nmagmatic provinces.  \n\nkeywords: layered intrusion, PGE, nickel-rich olivine, mafic-ultramafic \n\nmagmatism \n\n \n\n \n\n1.1 - Introduction \n\n The Luanga Complex is part of a cluster of PGE-mineralized mafic-ultramafic \n\nintrusions located in the eastern portion of the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province, denominated \n\nSerra Leste Suite. This suite consists of several small to medium size intrusions that \n\nhost PGE mineralizations of different styles, including PGE associated with chromitite \n\nlayers, stratabound magmatic base metal sulfide zones and hydrothermal alteration \n\nzones (e.g., Diella et al., 1995; Ferreira Filho et al., 2007; Teixeira et al., 2015). These \n\nlayered intrusions have Neoarchean ages (e.g., Machado et al., 1991; Teixeira et al., \n\n2015) that overlap with the ca. 2.75 Ga extensive basaltic magmatism of the Caraj\u00e1s \n\nMineral Province (e.g., Trendall et al., 1998), thus representing coeval magmatic events \n\nat the scale attributed to large igneous provinces (LIP; Ernst et al., 2005). The spatial \n\nassociation of PGE-mineralized layered intrusions of the Serra Leste suite led to the \n\nsuggestion that they originated from a PGE-fertile parental magma (Ferreira Filho et al., \n\n2007; Teixeira et al., 2015). How magmas with distinctive geochemical characteristics \n\nthat enhance the origin of Ni-Cu-PGE deposits are formed and whether such \n\ncompositions are systematically associated with Ni-Cu-PGE deposits is a debated issue \n\n(e.g., Zhang et al., 2008; Fiorentini et al., 2010; Griffin et al., 2013). While some studies \n\nhave proposed that LIP containing Ni-Cu-PGE deposits have magmas with distinctive \n\ngeochemical compositions, usually attributed to specific characteristics of the sub-\n\ncontinental lithosphere (e.g., Maier and Groves, 2011; Griffin et al., 2013), others \n\nindicate that a systematic association of unusual magmas and magmatic deposits are not \n\nsupported by current data (e.g., Fiorentini et al., 2010; Barnes et al., 2015). In this study \n\nwe present anomalously high Ni contents for olivine in rocks of the Luanga Complex. \n\nExtensive data on olivine compositions have been used to suggest that high Ni contents \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n \n\nin olivine occur in mantle melts from sources containing high proportions of recycled \n\noceanic crust (i.e., Sobolev et al., 2005 and 2007) due to the predominance of pyroxene \n\nover olivine in the source. Ni-rich magmas with elevated PGE contents are also \n\nattributed to processes that lead to the dissolution of previously formed sulfides during \n\nmagma ascent (i.e., Kerr and Leitch, 2005). Our results provide additional data to the \n\nongoing debate about whether Ni-Cu-PGE deposits are favored or not by specific \n\nmagma compositions. \n\n This paper presents the first extensive geological and geochemical \n\ncharacterization of the Luanga Complex, the layered intrusion that hosts the most \n\nsignificant stratiform/stratabound PGE mineralization in Caraj\u00e1s (Ferreira Filho et al, \n\n2007). Our results provide evidence for an anomalous Ni-rich magmatism associated \n\nwith the PGE-mineralized Luanga Complex. These results are compared with previous \n\nstudies of layered intrusions in the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province and worldwide in order to \n\nevaluate the petrological processes that take place during the evolution of PGE-fertile \n\ndistricts.  \n\n \n\n1.2 - Regional setting \n\n \n\n1.2.1 \u2013 The Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province \n\n The Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province is one of the most important mineral provinces of \n\nthe South American continent, hosting several Fe, Cu\u2013Au and Ni world-class deposits. \n\nIt is located in the southeastern portion of the Amazonian Craton (Fig. 1.1A), bounded \n\nby the Neoproterozoic Araguaia Belt in the east and south, and overlain by \n\nPaleoproterozoic sequences generically assigned to the Uatum\u00e3 Supergroup in the west \n\n(Ara\u00fajo and Maia, 1991; Docegeo, 1988). To the north, where Paleoproterozoic gneiss\u2013\n\nmigmatite\u2013granulite terrains predominate (Vasquez et al., 2008), geological limits are \n\nnot precisely defined. The Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province is subdivided into two Archean \n\ntectonic domains: the older Mesoarchean Rio Maria Domain to the south and the \n\nyounger Neoarchean Caraj\u00e1s Domain to the north (Fig. 1.1B; Ara\u00fajo and Maia, 1991; \n\nAra\u00fajo et al., 1988; Dall'Agnol et al., 2006; Docegeo, 1988; Feio et al., 2013). A \n\nregional E\u2013W shear zone, known as the Transition Subdomain (Feio et al., 2013), \n\nseparates the Rio Maria and Caraj\u00e1s domains. \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 1.1: A) Location of the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province. AM - Amazonian Craton; B \u2013 Borborema \n\nProvince; M \u2013 Mantiqueira Province; SF \u2013 S\u00e3o Francisco Craton; T \u2013 Tocantins Province. B) \n\nGeology and mineral deposits of the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province (modified from Vasquez et al., 2008). \n\nThe dashed rectangle indicates the position of Figure 2. \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n \n\n The Rio Maria Domain is a typical granite\u2013greenstone terrain (Vasquez et al., \n\n2008). The Andorinhas Supergroup (Docegeo, 1988) comprises several individual \n\nMesoarchean greenstone belts (2904 \u00b1 29 Ma;Macambira and Lancelot, 1996) and \n\nmetasedimentary rocks (Huhn et al., 1986; Souza and Dall'Agnol, 1996; Souza et al., \n\n2001). The recent characterization of spinifex-textured komatiites in a greenstone belt \n\nsequence within the Transition Subdomain (Siepierski and Ferreira Filho, 2016) \n\nsuggests that granite\u2013greenstone terrains extend further north than indicated in previous \n\nregional maps. \n\n The basement of the Caraj\u00e1s Domain consists mainly of gneiss\u2013 migmatite\u2013\n\ngranulite terrains of the Xingu Complex (Docegeo, 1988; Machado et al., 1991; Pidgeon \n\net al., 2000). The evolution of the Caraj\u00e1s Domain, where the study area is located, is \n\nwidely discussed. Different models have been proposed to explain the evolution of the \n\nArchean volcano-sedimentary sequences, which includes the large sequence of \n\nmetabasalts of the Gr\u00e3o Par\u00e1 Group (ca. 2.75 Ga; Machado et al., 1991; Vasquez et al., \n\n2008). While several studies have proposed an intraplate rift model (Gibbs et al., 1986; \n\nVillas and Santos, 2001), others have suggested subduction-related environments \n\n(Dardenne et al., 1988; Teixeira and Eggler, 1994). These volcano-sedimentary \n\nsequences are covered by low-grade metamorphic sequences of clastic sedimentary \n\nrocks of the \u00c1guas Claras Formation (i.e., Rio Fresco Group; Ara\u00fajo et al., 1988; \n\nDocegeo, 1988; Nogueira et al., 1994, 2000). \n\n Several mafic\u2013ultramafic complexes intrude into both the Xingu Complex and \n\nthe Archean volcano-sedimentary sequences (Docegeo, 1988; Ferreira Filho et al., \n\n2007). These intrusions host large Ni laterite deposits (e.g., On\u00e7a-Puma, Vermelho, \n\nJacar\u00e9) as well as PGE deposits (e.g., Luanga, Lago Grande) and were ascribed as part \n\nof the Catet\u00e9 Suite in regional studies (e.g., Macambira and Ferreira Filho, 2002). \n\nSignificant differences in the magmatic structure and evolution of the layered intrusions \n\nsuggest, however, that they belong to different Neoarchean magmatic suites (e.g., \n\nFerreira Filho et al., 2007; Rosa, 2014; Teixeira et al., 2015). \n\n \n\n1.2.2 - The Serra Leste Magmatic Suite  \n \n\n The Serra Leste Magmatic Suite (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007) consists of a cluster \n\nof small- to medium-size layered mafic-ultramafic intrusions located in the northeastern \n\nportion of the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province (Fig. 1.2). Mafic-ultramafic complexes are \n\nintrusive into gneiss rocks of the Xingu Complex and/or volcanic-sedimentary rocks of \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n \n\nthe Gr\u00e3o Par\u00e1 Group. This suite was originally grouped based on abundant PGE \n\nanomalies of the layered intrusions, disregarding any geological, stratigraphic or \n\npetrological consideration (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007). Recent studies of the Lago \n\nGrande Complex (Teixeira et al., 2015) and Luanga Complex (this study) are the first \n\nsystematic stratigraphic and petrological investigations of layered intrusions ascribed to \n\nthe Serra Leste Suite, thus providing data for the composition of their parental magmas \n\nand fractionation processes. Geochronological studies of the Serra Leste Suite are \n\nrestricted to the crystallization age of the Luanga Complex (2,763 \u00b1 6 Ma, U-Pb in \n\nzircon, Machado et al. 1991) and Lago Grande Complex (2,722 \u00b1 53 Ma, U-Pb in \n\nzircon, Teixeira et al. 2015). Magmatic ages of the layered intrusions overlap with the \n\nage of the bimodal volcanism of the Gr\u00e3o Par\u00e1 Group (2,759 \u00b1 2 Ma, U-Pb in zircon, \n\nMachado et al. 1991; 2,760 \u00b1 11 Ma, U-Pb in zircon, Trendall et al. 1998), supporting \n\nthe interpretation that they are part of a major Neoarchean magmatic event (Machado et \n\nal., 1991; Ferreira Filho et al., 2007). The architecture of the intrusion and the \n\ncrystallization sequence described in the Luanga and Lago Grande complexes (Fig. 1.2) \n\nindicate an overturned layered sequence (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007; Teixeira et al., \n\n2015). Even though the tectonic processes leading to the overturned sequence of layered \n\nrocks in the Lago Grande and Luanga complexes have so far not been studied in detail, \n\nregional structural studies in the Serra Leste region indicate significant tectonic \n\ntransport that may lead to major overturned blocks (Holdsworth and Pinheiro, 2000; \n\nTavares, 2015). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 1.2: Geology of the Serra Leste region. Partially modified from unpublished report of VALE.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n \n\n1.3 \u2013 Sampling and analytical procedures \n \n\n For this study, drill core from eleven boreholes and outcrops rocks were \n\nsystematically sampled in order to select unweathered rocks with primary magmatic \n\nminerals and textures. The analytical procedures are described as follows.  \n\n1.3.1 - Microprobe analyses \n \n\n Mineral analyses were performed on polished thin section using a JEOL \n\nJXA-8230 SuperProbe with 5 wavelength dispersive (WDS) spectrometers at the \n\nElectron Microprobe Laboratory of the University of Bras\u00edlia (Brazil). Systematic WDS \n\nanalyses were obtained for olivine, orthopyroxene and plagioclase. Operating conditions \n\nfor the WDS analyses for orthopyroxene and plagioclase were 15 kV accelerating \n\nvoltage, with a beam current of 10 nA and probe diameters of 3 ?m for orthopyroxene \n\nand 5 ?m for plagioclase. Count times on peak and on background were 10s and 5s \n\nrespectively. Operating conditions for Ni were 15 kV accelerating voltage, with a beam \n\ncurrent of 100 nA, probe diameters of 3 ?m and count times on peak and on background \n\nwere 60s and 30s, respectively. These different conditions were used because of the \n\nimportance of Ni values for further discussions. Using these analytical conditions, \n\ndetection limits for major elements are around 100 ppm while for Ni the detection limit \n\nis around 25 ppm. Both synthetic and natural mineral standards were used for the \n\nanalyses and the same standards and procedure were retained throughout the analytical \n\nwork. The results are provided in Online Supplementary Table 1.  \n\n1.3.2 - Bulk rock analyses \n \n\nSample preparation and lithogeochemical analyses were performed at ALS \n\nChemex (Canada). Analytical procedures include the whole-rock package plus LOI \n\n(ALS Chemex codes: ME-XRF12st and OA-GRA05x), total S plus total C (ALS \n\nChemex codes: S-IR08 and C-IR07) and the 38 elements fusion ICP-MS package (ALS \n\nChemex code: ME-MS81).

Unweathered rocks are \n\nabundant compared to adjacent areas of the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral province and consist \n\nmainly of massive blocks and boulders. The most prominent geomorphologic feature \n\nconsists of an elongated arc-shaped smooth hill sustained mainly by ultramafic rocks, \n\nup to 60 meters higher than flat areas where gabbroic rocks prevail. The layering forms \n\nan arc-shaped structure (Fig. 1.3A) that matches the morphology. Host rocks of the \n\nLuanga Complex consist of highly foliated gneiss and migmatite of the Xingu Complex \n\nin the south/southeast and mafic volcanics and iron formations of the Gr\u00e3o Par\u00e1 Group \n\nin the north/west. \n\nThe central portion of the complex has the thickest sequence of layered rocks. \n\nTo the north and northeastern the layered sequence is truncated by granitic intrusions \n\nand, to the south, it becomes progressively thinner. The Luanga Complex and host rocks \n\nare cross cut by NNW-SSE diabase dykes. These vertical dykes are up to several meters \n\nwide and consist of fine- to medium-grained intergranular to ophitic textured rocks with \n\nthin aphanitic chilled margins.  Diabase dykes consist mainly of clinopyroxene, olivine \n\nand plagioclase, with accessory Ti-magnetite. They belong to a Proterozoic swarm of \n\nmagnetic mafic dykes that occurs in the Serra Leste region (Teixeira, 2013; Teixeira et \n\nal., 2015). \n\nGeological sections (e.g., Fig. 1.3B) defined by drilling indicate that igneous \n\nlayers have steep dip to the SE. These sections indicate that the Ultramafic Zone \n\noverlies the Transition Zone, which overlies the Mafic Zone, suggesting thus that the \n\nlayered sequence is tectonically overturned. An overturned layered sequence was \n\npreviously described for the Luanga Complex (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007) and for the \n\nLago Grande Complex (Teixeira, et al., 2015). These studies suggest the existence of \n\nregional scale structures leading to large overturned blocks in the Serra Leste region.  \n\nThe subdivision of the Luanga Complex into three zones, Ultramafic, Transition \n\nand Mafic, is based on different type and/or proportion of cumulus minerals (Fig. 1.3C). \n\nThe estimated thickness of the layered sequence indicated in the stratigraphic column \n\n(Fig. 1.3C) and schematic block diagram (Fig. 1.4) is constrained by extensive drilling \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n \n\nin the central portion of the complex, likely to represent the axial portion of the original \n\nmagma chamber.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 1.3: A) Geological map of the Luanga Complex (partially modified from unpublished report of \n\nVALE). Note the sampled boreholes and outcrops referred in this study. B) Geological section on \n\nthe central portion of the complex (partially modified from unpublished report of VALE). C) \n\nRepresentative stratigraphic column for the Luanga Complex. Note the variation of cumulus \n\nminerals along the stratigraphy. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n \n\n1.4.1.1 \u2013Ultramafic Zone \n \n\n The Ultramafic Zone, about 5 km long and up to 1 km wide, is up to 800 meters \n\nthick (Fig. 1.3C) and consists of serpentinites (i.e., metamorphosed peridotite) with a \n\nfew meters thick orthopyroxenite lenses at the upper portions (facing criteria \n\nconsidering the overturned sequence). The lower contact of the Ultramafic Zone with \n\nthe Xingu Complex and Gr\u00e3o Par\u00e1 Group is poorly exposed and was mapped based \n\nmainly on soil geochemistry surveys. The contact with the overlying Transition Zone is \n\ngradational and characterized by a 5-10 meters thick sequence of interlayered \n\northopyroxenite and serpentinite. Serpentinite is a massive fine-grained rock  (Fig. \n\n1.5A), with discrete cross-cutting domains of foliated magnetite-serpentine schist. These \n\nfoliated domains are up to several meters thick and probably result of discrete high \n\nstrain zones. Magmatic textures are usually preserved in massive serpentinites but \n\nprimary igneous minerals are commonly partially to extensively replaced by \n\nmetamorphic minerals. Based upon the domains with best preserved textures and \n\nminerals, serpentinites are olivine (Ol) cumulates with abundant intercumulus minerals. \n\nChromite (Chr) is a common accessory mineral (~ 2 vol.%) suggesting its occurrence as \n\na liquidus (or cumulus) mineral throughout the Ultramafic Zone. Chromite occurs in \n\nrelict cores of fine-grained euhedral crystals variably replaced by magnetite (or \n\nferrichromite) in the outer rim or along fractures. Serpentinites have variable modal \n\nproportions of serpentine, chlorite, talc, amphibole (tremolite/actinolite) and magnetite, \n\nas the result of extensive replacement of olivine and intercumulus minerals. Textural \n\nand mineralogical features indicate that the Ultramafic Zone consists mainly of olivine \n\n+ chromite cumulates with ortho- to mesocumulate textures, the later consisting of \n\nabundant intercumulus plagioclase (Pl) and orthopyroxene (Opx).  \n\n \n\n1.4.1.2 \u2013Transition Zone \n \n\n  The Transition Zone, about 5 km long and up to 1 km wide, comprises an up to \n\n800 meters thick (Fig. 1.3C) pile of interlayered ultramafic and mafic cumulate rocks. \n\nInterlayering of different rocks types in different scales (from a few centimeters up to \n\ndozens of meters), is a distinctive feature of the Transition Zone. Cumulate rocks have \n\nvariable textures, from adcumulate to orthocumulate, and variable assemblages of \n\ncumulus and intercumulus minerals. The most common rock types are orthopyroxenite, \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n \n\nharzburgite, norite and chromitite, but minor dunite, troctolite, olivine orthopyroxenite \n\nand melanorite occur in the Transition Zone.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nFig. 1.4: A) Simplified tridimensional model of the Luanga Complex. Note the overturned \n\nstructure where the Ultramafic Zone overlies the Transition and Mafic Zones. The downward \n\nlimit of the PGE mineralization is given by drilling. B) Panoramic view of the Luanga \n\nComplex. Note the contrasting highest relief of the Transition Zone and the flat terrain of the \n\nMafic Zone. The higher hill in the back consists of iron formation and volcano-sedimentary \n\nrocks from the Gr\u00e3o Par\u00e1 Group. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n \n\n Orthopyroxenite is a medium- to coarse-grained orthopyroxene cumulate. The \n\ntexture varies from adcumulate (Fig. 1.5B) to meso- and orthocumulate with plagioclase \n\nas the predominant intercumulus mineral. The transition from an adcumulate \n\northopyroxenite to orthocumulate rocks (i.e., plagioclase orthopyroxenite or melanorite) \n\nis commonly gradational and result from continuous upward increase in plagioclase \n\ncontent.  \n\n Harzburgite is a medium- to coarse-grained olivine and chromite cumulate with \n\nmeso- to orthocumululate texture. Most rocks consist of abundant oikocrysts of \n\northopyroxene (harzburgite) or orthopyroxene and plagioclase (plagioclase harzburgite) \n\nenclosing several olivine and chromite crystals (Fig. 1.5C). Olivine crystals included in \n\northopyroxene oikocrysts show corrosion features (Fig. 1.5D) indicating a peritetic \n\nreaction of cumulus olivine and intercumulus liquid (i.e, Ol + liquid = Opx).  \n\n Norite is a medium-grained orthopyroxene and plagioclase adcumulate rock (Fig \n\n1.5E). It occurs as discontinuous layers commonly following a gradational upward \n\nfractionation from orthopyroxenite, to plagioclase orthopyroxenite and norite.\n\n Chromitite layers with variable thickness and textures occur mainly in the upper \n\nportions of the Transition Zone and the lowermost portion of the Mafic Zone (Fig. \n\n1.3C). The thickest chromitite is an up to 60 cm chromite-rich layer located at the \n\ncontact between the upper harzburgite and orthopyroxenite layers from the Transition \n\nZone. Several thin chromitites (&lt;10 cm-thick) occur in the Transition Zone and in the \n\nlowermost portion of the Mafic Zone. Thin chromitites hosted by noritic rocks are \n\ncommonly preceded by a thin layer of harzburgite, These chromitites are fine- to \n\nmedium-grained chromite cumulates with intercumulus plagioclase and orthopyroxene \n\nThe upward transition from massive chromitite, to chain textured chromitite and \n\ndisseminated chromite is common and provides a facing criterion for the igneous \n\nstratigraphy of the Luanga Complex (Fig. 1.5F).  \n\n1.4.1.3 \u2013 Mafic Zone \n \n\nThe Mafic Zone, about 5 km long and up to 3 km wide, comprises an up to 2000 \n\nmeters-thick (Fig. 1.3C) sequence of monotonous noritic rocks (i.e., orthopyroxene and \n\nplagioclase cumulates). Minor interlayered ultramafic rocks in the Mafic Zone consist \n\nmainly of orthopyroxenite (Fig. 1.3C). These rocks are similar to those described in the \n\nTransition Zone.

The core is 4.7 centimeters wide in all photos. Mineral abbreviations: \n\n(Ol) olivine, (Opx) orthopyroxene and (Plg) plagioclase. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n \n\northopyroxene is the characteristic rock type of the Mafic Zone (Fig. 1.5G). These rocks \n\nare adcumulates except for rare domains with interstitial quartz and/or clinopyroxene \n\n \n\n1.4.1.4 \u2013 Sulfide Zone \n \n\n Several PGE-mineralized intervals occur in the Transtion Zone but the Sulfide \n\nZone hosts the bulk of the PGE resources in the Luanga Complex (Ferreira Filho et al., \n\n2007). A detailed description of the PGE deposit is being developed (Mansur et al., in \n\nprep.) and just a brief description of the Sulfide Zone is provided in here. The Sulfide \n\nZone consists of a 10 \u2013 50 meters thick interval with disseminated sulfides located at the \n\ncontact of the Ultramafic and Transition zones (Figs. 1.3A, 1.3B and 1.4A). This \n\nstratabound PGE mineralization consists of disseminated sulfides (~ 1-3 vol. %) hosted \n\nmainly by orthopyroxenite. Base metal sulfides (pentlandite > pyrrhotite > >> \n\nchalcopyrite) interstitial to cumulus silicates or their pseudomorphs characterize the \n\nSulfide Zone. PGE contents in the Sulfide Zone have strong positive correlation with \n\nmodal sulfides. Pt+Pd contents are highly variable in the mineralized interval, from a \n\nfew ppb up to several ppm, have positive correlation with copper and sulfur contents, \n\nand show consistent Pt/Pd ratios of about 0.7 (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007; Mansur et al., \n\nin prep.). In addition to PGE associated with disseminated sulfides in the Sulfide Zone, \n\ndistinctively PGE enriched (Pt+Pd > 1 ppm) occur in sulfide-poor intervals in the \n\nTransition Zone. These unusual sulfide-poor PGE mineralizations are similar to those \n\ndescribed in the Serra da On\u00e7a Complex (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007) and in the footwall \n\nzone of the Santa Rita deposit in the Mirabela Complex (Ferreira Filho et. al., 2013). \n\n \n\n1.4.1.5 \u2013 Metamorphism \n \n\n Metamorphic assemblages commonly replace primary igneous minerals of the \n\nLuanga Complex. This metamorphic alteration is heterogeneous and characterized by an \n\nextensive hydration that largely preserves primary textures, bulk rock compositions and \n\nthe compositional domains of igneous minerals. The penetrative fabric is restricted to \n\nnarrow domains of up to a few meters across, and igneous textures are identified in \n\nadjacent nondeformed domains. These assemblages include serpentine + talc + \n\nmagnetite \u00b1 cummingtonite in replaced olivine-bearing ultramafic rocks, talc + \n\nserpentine + magnetite \u00b1 cummingtonite in replaced orthopyroxenites, and hornblende + \n\nchlorite + epidote in replaced mafic rocks. Metamorphic assemblages indicate \n\ntemperatures up to the amphibolite facies of metamorphism in the Luanga (Ferreira \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n \n\nFilho et al., 2007) and Lago Grande Complexes (Teixeira et al., 2015). The age and type \n\nof metamorphism affecting the layered intrusions and their host metavolcanic and \n\nmetasedimentary rocks in the Serra Leste region is a debated issue (Dardenne et al., \n\n1988; Suita, 1988; Teixeira et al., 2015; Tavares, 2015) and will not be addressed in this \n\nstudy. However, the effect of metamorphism on sulfides is relevant for discussions \n\nregarding PGE mineralizations hosted by sulfide-bearing and sulfide-poor cumulate \n\nrocks in the Luanga Complex. The metamorphic alteration is heterogeneous as indicated \n\nby rocks with magmatic minerals and texture closely associated (i.e., a few to dozen of \n\nmeters apart in drill core) with rocks where primary textures are preserved but \n\nmagmatic minerals are extensively replaced. Apart from highly variable hydration, the \n\ncompositions of variably altered samples are very similar when recalculated on \n\nanhydrous basis, thus supporting that metamorphic alteration does not promote a \n\nsignificant change in composition. \n\n \n\n1.4.2 \u2013 Mineral Chemistry  \n \n\n Systematic studies of mineral chemistry of cumulus minerals from the Luanga \n\nComplex (i.e., olivine, orthopyroxene and plagioclase) were performed in samples \n\ncollected in a representative section along the central and northern parts of the complex \n\n(Fig. 1.3A). This composed section comprises drill core samples collected from \n\nboreholes intersecting the Ultramafic Zone (LUFD-143, LUFD-141 and LUFD-69), \n\nTransition Zone (LUFD-69, LUFD-71, LUFD-77, LUFD-78 and LUFD-79) and Mafic \n\nZone (LUFD-105, LUFD-104 and LUFD-93), together with samples from outcrops of \n\nthe Mafic Zone (see Fig. 1.3A for the location of boreholes and outcrops). Based on \n\ndetailed sampling (~ 140 samples) and petrographic studies, 10 samples with olivine, 19 \n\nsamples with orthopyroxene and 27 samples with plagioclase were chosen for chemical \n\nanalyses. Olivine was analysed in samples of serpentinite and harzburgite from the \n\nUltramafic and Transition zones, respectively. Orthopyroxene was analysed in samples \n\nof orthopyroxenite, harzburgite and norite from the Transition Zone. Plagioclase was \n\nanalysed in samples of norite from the Transition and Mafic zones. Compositional \n\nvariation of olivine, orthopyroxene and plagioclase with stratigraphy in the Luanga \n\nComplex is shown in figure 1.6.  \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nOlivine compositions range from Fo78.8 to Fo86.7 mol% (Fig. 1.6) indicating \n\nmoderately primitive compositions. A systematic evaluation of cryptic variation of \n\nolivine is hampered by the restricted distribution of unaltered crystals throughout the \n\nUltramafic and Transition zones. Nevertheless, our results indicate that higher Fo \n\ncontents occur in harzburgites of the upper portion of the Transition Zone (Fig. 1.6). Ni \n\ncontents in olivine from the Ultramafic Zone range from 2800 to 3700 ppm and are \n\npositively correlated with Fo contents (Fig. 1.7A). Ni contents in olivine crystals from \n\nthe Transition Zone range from 4500 to 7400 ppm and are weakly correlated with Fo \n\ncontents (Fig. 1.7A). Considering the Fo range, the contents of Ni in the Luanga \n\nComplex, especially in the Transition Zone, are distinctively high.  \n\nOrthopyroxene compositions range from En77.0 to En89.9 mol% in the Transition \n\nZone. The cryptic variation of orthopyroxene shows many reversals within a consistent \n\nupward increase in En contents, suggesting an inverse fractionation in the Transition \n\nZone (Fig. 1.6). This trend is consistent with olivine compositions and indicates \n\nFig. 1.6:  Compositional variations of cumulus minerals throughout the stratigraphy of the \n\nLuanga Complex.  \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n \n\nprogressively more primitive compositions (i.e., higher Mg/Mg+Fe ratios) toward de \n\nupper portions of the Transition Zone. Ni contents in orthopyroxene range from 800 to \n\n1700 ppm with weak positive correlation with En contents (Fig. 1.7B). Ni contents in \n\northopyroxene of the Transition Zone are distinctively high and consistent with elevated \n\nvalues reported for olivine.  \n\nPlagioclase compositions range from An83.2 to An57.3 mol% in the Mafic Zone \n\nand the upper portion of the Transition Zone. The cryptic variation of plagioclase shows \n\nseveral reversals within a consistent upward decrease in An contents, suggesting a \n\nnormal fractionation in the Mafic Zone (Fig. 1.6).

B) Plot of Ni versus \n\nenstatite contents for orthopyroxene crystals. \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n \n\nIn summary, cryptic variations shown in figure 1.6 indicate an inverse \n\nfractionation trend in the Transition Zone, followed by a normal fractionation trend in \n\nthe Mafic Zone. These broad compositional trends include several reversals throughout \n\nthe stratigraphy of the Luanga Complex, thus suggesting a magmatic evolution in a \n\ndynamic open system magma chamber, a subject to be considered in the following \n\ndiscussions.  \n\n1.4.3 -  Bulk rock geochemistry \n \n\n A group of 21 samples representative of the stratigraphy of the Luanga \n\nComplex, comprising 3 samples from the Ultramafic Zone, 11 samples from the \n\nTransition Zone and 7 samples from the Mafic Zone, was analysed for major, minor and \n\ntrace elements (see Table 1.1 and Online Supplementary Table 2). Variable amounts of \n\nloss on ignition reflect the degree of alteration and/or different alteration minerals for \n\ndistinct rock types. Hence, the compositions of major and minor elements are \n\nnormalized to 100% on an anhydrous basis. The reasoning for normalizing on \n\nanhydrous basis is to equilibrate differences originated by various degrees of hydration, \n\nespecially when olivine cumulates (i.e., 6 to 11 wt.% LOI) are compared with \n\northopyroxene or orthopyroxene-plagioclase cumulates (i.e., 1 to 5 wt.% LOI).  \n\n \n\n1.4.3.1 \u2013 Major and minor elements \n \n\n Because the Luanga Complex consists of cumulate rocks, their major and trace \n\nelement compositions are controlled by the type of cumulus minerals. The plot of MgO \n\nvs major element oxides (Fig. 1.8A-F) is consistent with the predominance of olivine, \n\northopyroxene and plagioclase cumulates, as indicated by petrographic studies. This \n\nsuggestion is supported by comparing major element compositions with the \n\ncomposition of cumulus minerals obtained in this study (Fig. 1.8A-F).  \n\n Rocks with olivine as cumulus mineral (i.e., serpentinite and harzburgite) have \n\nMgO content (normalized to 100% on an anhydrous basis) between 26.05 to 43.17 \n\nwt.%. These highly variable values are consistent with distinctively different \n\nproportions of intercumulus minerals in these rocks, as indicated by samples with \n\nadcumulate to orthocumulate textures. The contents of SiO2, CaO, Al2O3, Na2O and \n\nK2O of these rocks are not controlled just by different proportions of olivine and \n\northopyroxene (Fig. 1.8A-F). Compositions plotting outside the Ol-Opx tie lines have  \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 1.8:  A-H: Plot of MgO versus major element oxides and minor elements for rocks of the \n\nLuanga Complex. I: Plot of Al2O3 versus CaO for rocks of the Luanga Complex. Data from \n\nTable 1 normalized to 100% on an anhydrous basis. Compositions of olivine, orthopyroxene and \n\nplagioclase correspond to microprobe analyses reported in this study, whereas the composition of \n\nclinopyroxene are from gabbroic rocks of the Serra da On\u00e7a Complex (Rosa, 2014).  \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n \n\nintercumulus plagioclase, resulting in relatively lower SiO2 content and higher CaO and \n\nAl2O3 contents. The contents of Ni and Cr are controlled by olivine and chromite, \n\nrespectively (Fig. 1.8G-H). Values of Ni and Cr are compatible with Ni content in \n\nolivine (~ 3000-6000 ppm of Ni in rocks with approximately 40-50 vol. % olivine) and \n\nthe presence of chromite as an accessory mineral (~ 1-2 vol.%), respectively. Very low \n\nsulfur contents in these rocks (S &lt;0.04 wt.%) are consistent with the lack of sulfide \n\nminerals and Ni contents being controlled mainly by olivine.  \n\n Orthopyroxenites have MgO content (normalized to 100% on an anhydrous \n\nbasis) between 24.52 and 28.25 wt.%, consistent with rocks composed mainly of \n\ncumulus orthopyroxene and minor amounts of intercumulus plagioclase. The contents \n\nof SiO2, CaO, Al2O3, Na2O and Fe2O3 of these rocks are restricted to compositions \n\nplotted along the Opx-Pl tie lines (Fig. 1.8A-F). Cr contents (up to 3500 ppm) are \n\nessentially the same of the olivine-bearing samples, attesting that Cr is also controlled \n\nby accessory chromite in orthopyroxenites. Ni contents are lower than in olivine-bearing \n\nrocks (up to 1500 ppm) due to lower Ni content in orthopyroxene (up to 1600 ppm) \n\ncompared to olivine. \n\n Norite is the lithotype with the lowest MgO content (from 7.52 to 11.59 wt.%) of \n\nthe Luanga Complex. The compositions of norites from the Transition and Mafic zones \n\nare very similar (Fig. 1.8A-F) with contents of SiO2, CaO, Al2O3, Na2O and Fe2O3 \n\nrestricted to the plagioclase-orthopyroxene tie line (Fig. 1.8A-F), as expected for \n\nplagioclase-orthopyroxene adcumulates. Nevertheless, contents of K2O above and Na2O \n\nbellow the plagioclase-orthopyroxene tie line may result from minor alteration and/or \n\naccessory phlogopite (Fig. 1.8E-F). Cr and Ni contents decrease with decreasing MgO \n\ncontents as the result of progressive disappearance of chromite and reduction of Ni and \n\nCr contents in orthopyroxene with fractionation (Fig 1.8G-H). Cr contents of up to 1880 \n\nppm are consistent with the common presence of chromite as a liquidus mineral in \n\nnorites of the Transition Zone. \n\n Primary pyroxenes are not preserved throughout most of the Mafic Zone (Fig. \n\n1.8E-F). While extensive petrographic data indicate that norite is the only mafic rock \n\ntype in the Transition Zone, direct petrographic evidence is not available for the \n\nextensively replaced rocks of the Mafic Zone, This raises the possibility that \n\nfractionation in the Luanga Complex led to the crystallization of clinopyroxene as a \n\nliquidus mineral in the upper portion of the Mafic Zone, such that the crystallization \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n \n\nsequence evolved from Opx+Pl cumulates to Opx+Cpx+Pl cumulates, as described in \n\nseveral layered intrusions. The plot of CaO vs Al2O3, comparing bulk rock and mineral \n\ncompositions (Fig. 1.8I), indicate that plagioclase and orthopyroxene adcumulates \n\nprevail in the Mafic Zone. Sample LUFD-120B, a coarse-grained gabbroic rock \n\ncollected from an elongated 1-2 meters long pegmatoidal pod has a composition \n\nconsistent with a gabbronorite (Fig. 1.8I). This sample has the lowest MgO, Ni and Cr \n\ncontents (Fig. 1.8G-H) and is interpreted as resulting from crystallization of trapped \n\nintercumulus liquid. \n\n \n\n1.4.3.2 \u2013 Trace elements \n \n\nMafic-ultramafic rocks of the Luanga Complex have relatively low contents of \n\nincompatible trace elements (Table 1.1), as expected for olivine, pyroxene and \n\nplagioclase cumulates. Variations in contents of incompatible trace elements in mafic-\n\nultramafic cumulates in layered complexes result from the combined effect of variable \n\nassemblages of cumulus minerals, fractionation of the parental magma and variable \n\namounts of trapped intercumulus liquid (e.g., Barnes, 1986; Ferreira Filho et al., 1998). \n\nDistinct primitive mantle-normalized rare earth element (REE) profiles characterize \n\ndifferent cumulate rocks of the Luanga Complex (Fig. 1.9). REE profiles for \n\nserpentinites (i.e., olivine cumulates) have flat to slightly positive slope for LREE and \n\nflat slope for HREE (Fig. 1.9A). Sample LUFD-141-39, an extensively replaced \n\nserpentinite (11.57 wt.% LOI) with adcumulate texture, has the lowest contents of REE \n\n(Fig. 1.9A). This sample has an irregular REE profile with distinct negative Eu \n\nanomaly, likely to result from alteration or due to larger analytical errors in samples \n\nclose to the detection limits of the analytical methods. REE patterns for samples of \n\northopyroxenite (Fig. 1.9B) have positive slope for LREE and slightly negative slope \n\nfor HREE. The contents of LREE and primitive mantle normalized La/Sm ratios \n\n(La/Sm MN) of orthopyroxenites increase with the amount of intercumulus plagioclase. \n\nSamples with intercumulus plagioclase also have positive Eu anomalies, while an \n\nadcumulate orthopyroxenite (sample LUFD-69-115.64) has negative Eu anomaly (Fig. \n\n1.9B). REE patterns for harzburgite have slightly positive slope for LREE, flat to \n\nslightly negative slope for HREE and weak negative Eu anomalies (Fig. 1.9C). These \n\nsamples have the lowest LREE contents for the Luanga Complex. Norite from the \n\nTransition and Mafic zones has distinctively positive slopes for LREE, flat slopes for \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n \n\nHREE and distinctively positive Eu anomalies (Figs. 1.9D-E), as expected for rocks \n\nwith abundant plagioclase. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Contents for several incompatible high field strength elements (e.g., Ta, Nb, Th, \n\nHf) in ultramafic rocks of the Luanga Complex are close to their lower limits of \n\nquantification in the analyses of this study (Table 1.1), and should be considered with \n\ndiscretion. In addition, contents for several LILE (large ion lithophile elements) are \n\nvariable due to the effect of metamorphic alteration. In order to prevent scattering \n\nassociated with alteration or analytical uncertainties, mantle normalized trace elements \n\nFig. 1.9: Primitive mantle-normalized REE patterns for samples of the Luanga Complex.

Ore-hosting intrusions come in widely \n\nvariable architectures and sizes as the result of highly complex mechanisms of mantle \n\nmagma transport and storage in the crust (Barnes et al., 2016). Although typical tube-\n\nlike conduits (e.g., Limoeiro, Mota-e-Silva et al., 2013; Nebo-Babel, Seat et al., 2007) \n\nhave very distinct architecture compared with classical layered intrusions (e.g., \n\nSkaergaard, Irvine, 1987; Niquelandia, Ferreira Filho et al., 1992 and 2010), they are \n\njust members of a wide range of structures resulting from variable and usually \n\ncontinuous magmatic processes. The main features of the architecture of the Luanga \n\nComplex are listed below to provide the framework for the following discussion on the \n\ncompositional variations through the intrusion. \n\nFig. 1.10: Primitive mantle-normalized alteration-resistant trace elements patterns for samples of \n\nnorite from the Mafic Zone of the Luanga Complex. Data from Table 1 and Supplentary Table 2. \n\nLower and Upper Crust values are from Wedepohl (1995). Primitive mantle normalization \n\nvalues are from Sun and McDonough (1989). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n \n\na) The morphology is broadly an arc-shaped structure with a thicker central portion that \n\nbecomes thinner toward the edges. \n\nb) Layering in variable scales (from a few centimeters to a few hundred meters thick) is \n\nthe most characteristic structure. \n\nc) Cyclic units occur in all zones of the Luanga Complex and are abundant in the TZ. \n\n The features mentioned above are characteristic of layered intrusions originated \n\nin open-system magma chambers through successive influxes of magma. \n\n \n\n1.5.2 \u2013 Compositional variations through the Luanga Complex  \n \n\n Geochemical results described in this study provide constraints for the magmatic \n\nfractionation of the Luanga Complex. The schematic model in figure 1.11 summarizes \n\nthese features. The Ultramafic Zone (Fig. 1.11; Stage 1) at the base of the layered \n\nsequence results from initial inputs of magma into the chamber. Cryptic variation of \n\nolivine in the Ultramafic Zone indicates a narrow compositional range (Fo 79.3 to 84.9) \n\nand moderately primitive compositions. The restricted compositional range within the \n\nmonotonous sequence of olivine and chromite cumulates of the Ultramafic Zone \n\nsuggests open-system crystallization involving periodic replenishment by new primitive \n\nmagma pulses (Fig. 1.11; Stage 1). Fractionation following the replenishment of the \n\nmagma chamber is limited, such that the evolving magma does not usually depart from \n\nthe field where olivine and chromite are liquidus minerals. The contact of the \n\nUltramafic and Transition zones is marked by the change from a monotonous to a \n\nhighly variable sequence of rock types, the later interpreted as a sequence of cyclic \n\nunits. Cryptic variation of orthopyroxene in the Transition Zone (Fig. 1.6) indicates \n\nseveral reversals within a major upward trend of progressively more primitive \n\ncompositions. From bottom upwards this reversed fractionation consists of several \n\nnormal fractionating cyclic units of variable thickness, which are indicated by individual \n\ncycles consisting of a complete sequence of harzburgite, orthopyroxenite and norite, or \n\nan incomplete sequence (usually orthopyroxenite-norite or harzburgite-\n\northopyroxenite). Chromitite layers or seams commonly occur at the base of cyclic units \n\nas reported in several layered intrusions (e.g., Bushveld Complex, Naldrett et al., 2012; \n\nGreat Dyke, Wilson, 1982), or immediately (~ 10 centimeters) above the most primitive \n\nrock type of a new cycle. Cryptic variation of olivine in the Transition Zone indicates a \n\nlarger compositional range (Fo 78.8 to 86.7) compared to the Ultramafic Zone. Results \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n \n\nindicate that the most primitive olivine in the Luanga Complex occurs at the upper \n\nportion of the Transition Zone, which is consistent with cryptic variation of \n\northopyroxene (Fig. 1. 6). The compositional variation of orthopyroxene and olivine in \n\nthe Transition Zone suggests and open-system crystallization involving periodic \n\nreplenishment by new primitive magma pulses followed by significant fractionation \n\n(Fig. 1.11; Stage 2). To explain the reversed fractionation of the Transition Zone, the \n\nresidual magma resident in the magma chamber after fractionation should become \n\nprogressively more primitive. This upward trend of progressively more primitive \n\ncompositions may result either from an input of progressively more primitive parental \n\nmagma, or a progressive increase in the amount of the same parental magma. Despite \n\nthe fact that the Mafic Zone consists mainly of a monotonous sequence of \n\northopyroxene and plagioclase adcumulates, cryptic variation of plagioclase along the \n\nMafic Zone indicates multiple reversals within an upward fractionation trend (Fig. 1.6). \n\nThese reversals indicate several new influxes of fresh magma followed by fractionation, \n\nsuch that the evolving magma does not usually depart from the field where plagioclase \n\nand orthopyroxene are liquidus minerals (Fig. 1.11; Stage 3). \n\n Cryptic variation and the crystallization sequence along the stratigraphy of the \n\nLuanga Complex (Fig. 1.11) are characteristic of layered intrusions originated in highly \n\ndynamic open-system magma chambers, a common feature in PGE-mineralized \n\nintrusions.  \n\n1.5.3 \u2013Constraints on the composition of the parental melt \n \n\n The characterization of parental magmas in layered complexes is a key feature to \n\nunderstand the nature of mantle source, the amount of assimilation of crustal rocks \n\nduring ascent and emplacement and their potential to host economic deposits. The \n\ncomposition of the parental magma of the Luanga Complex cannot be constrained by \n\ncommon approaches used to define their composition in well-exposed intrusions with \n\nprimary composition and magmatic architecture largely preserved (e.g., chilled margin,  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nbulk composition, extrusive equivalents, related dykes). Once a direct composition of \n\nparental magma is not available, its nature can be inferred from the crystallization \n\nsequence and cumulate geochemistry. The compositional range of cumulus olivine \n\nwithin the Ultramafic and Transition zones of the Luanga Complex (Fo78.9-86.4) is \n\ncomparable to those reported for the central zone of the Jinchuan intrusion (Fo83-86; Li et \n\nal., 2004) and the Ultramafic Zone of the Lago Grande Complex (Fo80.0-84.7; Teixeira et \n\nal., 2015). This range of olivine compositions is typical of layered intrusions originated \n\nfrom moderate primitive parental magmas, as suggested by the MgO and FeO \n\ncompositions of 11.5 wt.% and 11.2 wt.% respectively, estimated by Chai and Naldrett \n\n(1992) for the parental magma of the Jinchuan Complex.  \n\nThe crystallization sequence of the Luanga Complex is similar to those of the \n\nmajor PGE-bearing intrusions (e.g., Bushveld, Stillwater, Great Dyke) in which \n\northopyroxene precedes clinopyroxene (Eales and Cawthorn, 1996). In fact, cumulus \n\nclinopyroxene does not occur in the Luanga Complex. The early crystallization of \n\northopyroxene indicates that the primary magma was silica saturated, a feature \n\ncommonly interpreted as the result of crustal assimilation (Campbell, 1985).  \n\nMantle-normalized trace element profiles for norites of the Luanga Complex \n\nshow characteristic negative Nb and Ta anomalies with relative enrichment in LREE \n\nFig. 1.11: Schematic model illustrating the evolution of the Luanga Complex. See text for \n\nexplanation. Mineral abbreviations: (Ol) olivine, (Opx) orthopyroxene and (Plg) plagioclase. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n \n\nand Th (Fig. 1.10). A comparison between alteration-resistant mantle-normalized trace \n\nelements of lower and upper crust and norites of the Luanga Complex shows similar \n\nprofiles (Fig. 1.10), which may be interpreted as the result of crustal assimilation during \n\nascent and/or emplacement of the parental magma. The trace element profiles for \n\ngabbroic rocks of the Luanga (Fig. 1.10) and Lago Grande complexes (Teixeira et al., \n\n2015) show the same pattern, characterized by negative Nb and Ta anomalies with \n\nrelative enrichment in LREE and Th. Additional evidence for crustal contamination of \n\nthe parental magma of the Lago Grande Complex is provided by Nd model ages \n\nbetween 2.94 and 3.56 Ga, with variably negative ?Nd (T .= 2.72 Ga) values (Teixeira et al., \n\n2015). Together with the crystallization sequence, geochemical results obtained for \n\nlayered intrusions of the Serra Leste region, are consistent with original mantle melts \n\ncontaminated with older continental crust. This interpretation is consistent with the \n\nemplacement of layered intrusions within gneisses and migmatites of the Xingu \n\nComplex (ca. 3.0 Ga). Although the distribution of alteration-resistant elements in the \n\nLuanga Complex is consistent with contamination of a primitive mantle melt with \n\ncontinental crust, lithogeochemical data from the Luanga Complex may also be \n\ninterpreted as the result of melting an old lithospheric mantle (Zhang et al., 2008). \n\n1.5.4 - Reasons for high nickel contents in olivine and orthopyroxene \n \n\n Compared with most layered intrusions, olivine from ultramafic rocks of the \n\nLuanga Complex has significantly higher Ni content (Fig. 1.12). In fact, when similar \n\nFo contents are considered, Ni contents in the Luanga Complex stand among the highest \n\nvalues ever reported in layered intrusions. The values reported in this study are much \n\nhigher than content in olivine with variable Fo contents (Fo70.7 to Fo91.5) of the Bushveld \n\nComplex (Fig. 1.12A), including Ni-rich olivine from the Sandsloot section located \n\nbelow the Platreef (Yudovskaya et al, 2013). The similar high Ni contents in the range \n\nof 4,000-14,000 ppm for Fo contents of 77.9-90.6 was reported in olivine from the Ni-\n\nPGE sulfide lensoid orebodies of the Kevitsa intrusion (Yang et al., 2013).  \n\n Possible reasons for high Ni contents in olivine and orthopyroxene include their \n\ncrystallization from anomalously Ni-rich magmas or their upgrade through interaction \n\nwith closely associated sulfide liquids (i.e., diffusion of Ni from sulfide liquid to \n\nsilicates) or sulfides (i.e., solid state diffusion of Ni from sulfides to silicates). The later \n\nmay be ruled out as an explanation for the Ni enrichment in olivine and orthopyroxene \n\ncrystals in rocks of the Luanga Complex, as high contents occur mainly in rocks with no \n\nassociated sulfides. In fact, the Ni content of olivine crystals within the Sulfide Zone (Ni \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n \n\ncontents in the range of 3700 to 5900 ppm) is the same or even lower than Ni content of \n\nolivine crystals from outside this zone (Ni contents in the range of 2800 to 7400 ppm). \n\nFurthermore, although minor Ni enrichment in zoned olivine crystals closely associated \n\nwith sulfides was reported in a few Ni-Cu deposits (e.g., Voisey's Bay: Li and Naldrett, \n\n1999; Santa Rita: Barnes et al., 2013), olivine crystals closely associated with sulfides \n\nare not Ni-enriched in the majority of deposits.  \n\n Possible mechanisms for Ni-enrichment of the parental magma include the \n\ngeneration of magmas from pyroxenitic mantle sources (Sobolev et al., 2005; 2007), or \n\nthe upgrading of magmas through dissolution of previously formed Ni-rich sulfide melts \n\n(Kerr and Leitch, 2005). These two alternative mechanisms to generate unusually Ni-\n\nrich magmas will be considered for the Luanga Complex. \n\n The Ni contents in olivine in equilibrium with primary magma from peridotite \n\nmantle should not contain more than 3,200 ppm Ni (Herzberg, 2011). On the other \n\nhand, magmas derived from pyroxenitic sources are expected to have higher Ni contents \n\n(up to a factor of 2) such that olivine in equilibrium with these magmas is expected to \n\nhave proportionally higher Ni contents (Sobolev et al., 2007; Herzberg, 2011). Sobolev \n\net al. (2007) used a large data set of high-precision analyses of olivine phenocrysts from \n\ndifferent tectonic settings to conclude that a pyroxenitic mantle source is a major \n\ncontributor to tholeiitic (silica-saturated) and transitional (moderately silica-\n\nundersaturated) magmas of ocean island basalts and large igneous provinces emplaced \n\non thick oceanic or continental lithosphere. The authors' data set indicates that most \n\nolivine crystals from these magma types are significantly enriched in Ni and depleted in \n\nMn. This mechanism was recently considered as an explanation for the high Ni contents \n\nof olivine crystals in the mafic-ultramafic intrusion associated with the Santa Rita Ni-\n\nCu-PGE sulfide deposit in Brazil (Fig. 1.12B, Barnes et al., 2013). The highest Ni \n\ncontents in olivine of the Luanga Complex occur in distinctively PGE enriched (Pt+Pd \n\n> 1 ppm) intervals of the Transition Zone, while olivine in the Ultramafic Zone have \n\nlower Ni (Fig. 1.7A) and PGE contents (Pt+Pd usually &lt;LDL= 80 ppb).  \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 1.12: Plot of Ni versus forsterite contents of olivine crystals from mafic-ultramafic complexes \n\nand komatiites.

C) \n\nData are shown for the Lago Grande Complex (Teixeira et al., 2015), the Serra da On\u00e7a and Serra \n\ndo Puma complexes (Rosa, 2014), the Vermelho and the Touro complexes (Siepierski, 2016), the \n\nJacar\u00e9 Complex (unpublished internal report) and Luanga Complex (this study). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n \n\n The association of high Ni contents in olivine with high PGE contents in both \n\nsulfide-poor and sulfide-rich intervals is characteristic of the Transition Zone. Because \n\nthe distribution of PGE during melting of pyroxenitic sources are not well constrained \n\nby experimental data, the interpretation for higher Ni contents in olivine crystals due to \n\na pyroxenitic mantle source indicated by Sobolev et al. (2007) does not necessarily \n\nprovide an explanation for the high PGE contents in the Luanga Complex. Nevertheless, \n\nBarnes et al. (2016) noticed that the basaltic crustal component most likely to provide \n\nthe raw material for deep mantle pyroxenite and eclogite, would be expected to be \n\nimpoverished in PGE compared with the peridotitic mantle. The authors conclude that \n\nmelts associated with pyroxenitic sources should be PGE-depleted compared to those \n\nderived mainly from peridotitic sources. \n\n The Kerr and Leitch (2005) model of partial dissolution of early formed \n\nmagmatic sulfides by new fresh inputs of fresh magmas, known as \"multistage-\n\ndissolution upgrading model\", provides a possible explanation to some extremely PGE-\n\nrich sulfides. Although the authors' model was mainly applied for the origin of high \n\ntenor sulfide liquids, the concept that preexisting sulfide liquid could be partly dissolved \n\nby later batches of magma, suggests that this process could also proceed to the sulfide \n\nliquid be entirely dissolved and previously extracted metals returned to later batches of \n\nsilicate magma (Kerr and Leitch, 2005). This process that may lead to the origin of \n\nmetal enriched magmas was proposed to explain the origin of extremely Ni-rich olivine \n\nassociated with Ni-PGE orebodies in the Kevitsa intrusion (Yang et al., 2013). The \n\nsuggested \"cannibalization\" of proto-sulfide ore model, applied for the Kevitsa PGE-\n\nrich magma, may also justify the association of high Ni contents in olivine with high \n\nPGE contents in both sulfide-poor and sulfide-rich rocks in the Luanga Complex. \n\n \n\n1.5.5 \u2013 Tectonic setting of the PGE-mineralized magmatism in the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral \n\nProvince  \n \n\n The ages of the layered intrusions of the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province (2763 \u00b1 6 Ma \n\nLuanga Complex: Machado et al., 1991; 2766 \u00b1 6 Ma Serra da On\u00e7a Complex: Lafon et \n\nal., 2000) overlap with ages of bimodal volcanism in the Gr\u00e3o Par\u00e1 Group (2759 \u00b1 2 \n\nMa: Machado et al., 1991; 2760 \u00b1 11 Ma: Trendall et al., 1998), supporting the \n\ninterpretation that mafic volcanics and mafic-ultramafic layered intrusions resulted from \n\ncoeval major magmatic events in the Caraj\u00e1s region (Machado et al., 1991; Ferreira \n\nFilho et al., 2007). The extensive basaltic volcanism is considered to result either from \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n \n\nintra-plate rifting of older continental crust (e.g., Gibbs et al., 1986; Olszewski et al., \n\n1989; Villas and Santos, 2001) or from subduction-related settings (Dardenne et al., \n\n1988; Teixeira and Eggler, 1994; Zucchetti, 2007). The basaltic volcanism in the \n\nCaraj\u00e1s Domain shows lithogeochemical and isotopic evidence for significant \n\ncontamination of mantle-derived melts by continental crust, thus supporting the \n\ncontinental rifting model (Gibbs et al., 1986; Olszewski et al., 1989). The structure and \n\ncomposition of the layered intrusions of the Caraj\u00e1s are also consistent with a \n\nNeoarchean intra-plate rifting environment in Caraj\u00e1s. Apart from contentious \n\ndiscussions regarding the tectonic setting of the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province, we use \n\nresults obtained in this study to evaluate the petro-tectonic setting of the PGE-\n\nmineralized magmatism in Caraj\u00e1s. \n\n The cluster of PGE-mineralized intrusions in the eastern portion of the Caraj\u00e1s \n\nMineral Province was identified during regional exploration (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007). \n\nMineralized intrusions have similar fractionation sequences, comparable petrological \n\nevolution, overlapped U-Pb zircon ages and similar styles of PGE mineralization, \n\nsupporting the interpretation that they belong to the same magmatic suite (Teixeira et \n\nal., 2015). Results obtained for the Lago Grande and Luanga complexes indicate that \n\nthis magmatic suite originated from siliceous magnesian basaltic magmas, similar to the \n\nparental liquids of the world's principal PGE-sulfide deposits (Barnes and Lightfoot, \n\n2005). However, the unusually high contents of Ni obtained in olivine of the Luanga \n\nComplex do not occur in the Lago Grande Complex (Fig. 1.12C). Considering the \n\npetrological similarities of these complexes, the distinct Ni contents in olivine are a \n\nremarkable feature. Distinct Ni contents in olivine suggest that the process leading to Ni \n\nenrichment in the parental magma is restricted to the Luanga Complex in the Serra \n\nLeste suite. Because the most significant PGE-mineralized intersections with \n\nconsistently high PGE tenors in the Serra Leste region occur in the Luanga Complex \n\n(Ferreira Filho et al., 2007; Mansur et al., in prep.), the same process should promote \n\nthe enrichment in Ni and PGE in the parental magma. Regardless of the mechanism \n\nleading to enrichment of Ni and PGE, the high Ni content in olivine described in the \n\nLuanga Complex has implications for mineral exploration. Unusually high Ni contents \n\nin olivine and/or orthopyroxene may provide an additional exploration tool for Ni-PGE \n\ndeposits. We have compared Ni content of olivine for several layered intrusions in the \n\nCaraj\u00e1s Mineral Province (Fig. 1.12C). Our data set includes data from complexes \n\nlocated in the Serra Leste region (Luanga and Lago Grande), the Cana\u00e3 dos Caraj\u00e1s \n\nregion (Vermelho and Touro), the Tucum\u00e3 region (Serra do On\u00e7a and Serra do Puma) \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n \n\nand a few analyses for the Jacar\u00e9 Complex located in the westernmost portion of the \n\nCaraj\u00e1s Mineral Province. All these intrusions have Ni contents in olivine compatible \n\nwith values obtained in most layered complexes globally, except Luanga and Jacar\u00e9 \n\ncomplexes  (Fig. 1.12A-B). Olivine in dunite and harzburgite of closely associated \n\nsamples of the Jacar\u00e9 Complex has very primitive composition (Fo contents range from \n\n89.8 to 92.7) and very high Ni content (4000 to 7000 ppm). The Jacar\u00e9 Complex is a \n\nvery large ultramafic intrusion (~ 100 Km\n2\n) best known for hosting large Ni laterite \n\nresources (Carlon et al., 2006). The magmatic structure and petrology of the Jacar\u00e9 \n\nComplex have not been investigated in detail and olivine analyses are limited to a few \n\nsamples. Nevertheless, preliminary data for olivine compositions are higher than most \n\nintrusions and may suggest a favorable potential for Ni-PGE mineralization.   \n\n \n\n1.6 - Conclusions  \n\n  \n\n Systematic geological and petrological characterization of the Luanga Complex \n\nprovides additional evidences for a PGE-fertile magmatism at the eastern portion of the \n\nCaraj\u00e1s Mineral Province. Our results indicate that Ni contents in olivine in the Luanga \n\nComplex (up to 7,500 ppm) stand among the highest values reported in layered \n\nintrusions globally. High Ni contents in olivine of the Luanga Complex occur in \n\ndistinctively PGE enriched (Pt+Pd > 1 ppm) intervals of the Transition Zone, in both \n\nsulfide-poor and sulfide-rich rocks. The origin of the PGE- and Ni-rich parental magma \n\nof the Luanga Complex is likely to result from the \u201ccannibalization\u201d of previously \n\nformed sulfides (Kerr and Leitch, 2005). Regardless of the process that lead to the \n\ngeneration of anomalously Ni- and PGE-rich magmas, our results indicate that an \n\nanomalous PGE-fertile magmatism took place at the eastern portion of the Caraj\u00e1s \n\nMineral Province, thus triggering the development of different styles of PGE \n\nmineralization.  \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements  \n \n\n \n\n This study was supported by CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento \n\nCient\u00edfico e Teconol\u00f3gico) and VALE S.A.

Chromitite layers in the Luanga \n\nComplex occur in the upper portion of interlayered harzburgite and orthopyroxenite of \n\nthe Transition Zone and associated with the lowermost norites of the Mafic Zone. The \n\nstratigraphic interval that hosts chromitites (~ 150 meters thick) consists of several \n\ncyclic units interpreted as the result of successive influxes of primitive parental magma. \n\nThe compositions of chromite in chromitites from the Transition Zone (Lower Group \n\nChromitites) have distinctively higher Cr# (100Cr/(Cr+Al+Fe3+)) compared with \n\nchromite in chromitites from the Mafic Zone (Upper Group Chromitites). Chromitites \n\nhosted by noritic rocks are preceded by a thin layer of harzburgite located 15-20 cm \n\nbelow each chromitite layer. Lower Cr# in chromitites hosted by noritic rocks are \n\ninterpreted as the result of increased Al2O3 activity caused by new magma influxes. \n\nElectron microprobe analyses on line transverses through 35 chromite crystals indicate \n\nthat they are rimmed and/or extensively zoned. The composition of chromite in \n\nchromitites changes abruptly in the outer rim, becoming enriched in Fe3+ and Fe2+ at \n\nthe expense of Mg, Cr, Al, thus moving toward the magnetite apex on the spinel prism. \n\nThis outer rim, characterized by higher reflectance, is probably related to the \n\nmetamorphic replacement of the primary mineralogy of the Luanga Complex. Zoned \n\nchromite crystals indicate an extensive exchange between divalent (Mg, Fe2+) cations \n\n\n\n \n\n52 \n \n\nand minor to none exchange between trivalent cations (Cr3+, Al3+ and Fe3+). This Mg-\n\nFe zoning is interpreted as the result of subsolidus exchange of Fe2+ and Mg between \n\nchromite and coexisting silicates during slow cooling of the intrusion. A remarkable \n\nfeature of chromitites from Luanga Complex is the occurrence of abundant silicate \n\ninclusions within chromite crystals. These inclusions show an adjacent inner rim with \n\nhigher Cr# and lower Mg# (100Mg/(Mg+Fe2+)) and Al# (100Al/(Cr+Al+Fe3+)). This \n\ncompositional shift is possibly due to crystallization from a progressively more \n\nfractionated liquid trapped in the chromite crystal. Significant modification of primary \n\ncumulus composition of chromite, as indicated in our study for the Luanga Complex, is \n\nlikely to be common in non-massive chromitites and the rule for disseminated chromites \n\nin mafic intrusions. \n\nkeywords: chromitite; chromite; corona; silicate inclusion; layered intrusion; \n\nCaraj\u00e1s \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1 - Introduction  \n \n\n Cr-bearing spinels have been used as important petrogenetic indicators in many \n\nstudies (e.g., Irvine, 1965; Stowe, 1994; Barnes and Roeder, 2001). The composition of \n\nchromite, a mineral relatively resistant to alteration that crystallizes over a wide range of \n\nmafic and ultramafic magmas, is particularly useful as an indicator of magmatic \n\nprocesses in rocks submitted to metamorphism or hydrothermal alteration. However, \n\nchromite is susceptible to significant post-magmatic modification, as indicated by \n\nseveral studies of chromite in komatiites (e.g., Barnes, 2000) and ophiolitic complexes \n\n(e.g., Evans and Frost, 1975; Gole and Hill, 1990). Primary chromite compositions \n\ninherited from the magma may also be modified due to reaction with intercumulus \n\nliquid or subsolidus reaction with silicates (e.g., Barnes and Roeder, 2001; Barnes, \n\n1998). Mass balance arguments are commonly used to indicate that massive chromitites \n\nwith > 70 % vol. chromite are likely to preserve its original igneous compositions \n\nbecause there are few other phases available for element exchange (e.g., Eales and \n\nReynolds, 1986). This reasoning was successfully used in several studies of chromitites \n\n(e.g., Bacuri Complex, Spier and Ferreira Filho, 2001; Ipueira-Medrado Sill, Marques \n\nand Ferreira Filho, 2003; Nuasahi and Sukinda Massifs, Mondal et al., 2006). However, \n\napart from massive chromitites, post-magmatic modifications should be carefully \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n \n\nevaluated before using chromite compositions to indicate magma types, tectonic \n\nenvironments and magmatic fractionation. \n\n This study, the first systematic description of chromitites throughout the \n\nstratigraphy of the Luanga Complex, provides an additional example of chromitites \n\nhosted by mafic cumulates. The stratigraphic distribution of chromitites and mineral \n\ncomposition data of chromite support previous results from host cumulate rocks \n\nsuggesting that the Luanga layered intrusion originated in a dynamic open-system \n\nmagma chamber (Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016). Our results also indicate extensive \n\nmodification of primary cumulus composition of chromite in chromitites of the Luanga \n\nComplex. We discuss this composition modification considering both late-magmatic \n\nand metamorphic processes. Our results indicate that the common use of chromite \n\ncomposition as a petrogenetic indicator for mafic intrusions should be considered with \n\ncaution.  \n\n \n\n2.2 - Regional setting \n \n\n2.2.1- The Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province \n \n\n The Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province, located in the southeastern portion of the \n\nAmazonian Craton (Fig. 2.1A), is one of the most important mineral provinces of the \n\nSouth American continent, hosting several world-class Cu-Au and Ni deposits along \n\nwith the largest iron resources of the world. The Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province is subdivided \n\nin two Archean tectonic domains: the Rio Maria Domain to the south and the Caraj\u00e1s \n\nDomain to the north (Fig. 2.1B; Vasquez et al., 2008). A poorly defined zone \n\ncharacterized by regional EW faults, designated as the Transition Subdomain (Feio et \n\nal., 2013), separates these two domains.  \n\n The Rio Maria Domain is a typical granite\u2013greenstone terrain (Vasquez et al., \n\n2008). The Andorinhas Supergroup (Docegeo, 1988) comprises several individual \n\nMesoarchean (ca. 2.94 Ga) greenstone belts (Macambira and Lancelot, 1996; Souza et \n\nal., 2001). The recent characterization of spinifex-textured komatiites in a greenstone \n\nbelt sequence within the Transition Subdomain (Siepierski and Ferreira Filho, 2016), \n\nsuggests that the Andorinhas Supergroup extends further north than indicated in \n\nprevious regional maps. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 2.1: A) Location of the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province.

B) \n\nGeological map of the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province (modified from Vasquez et al., 2008). The dashed \n\nrectangle indicates the location of the Serra Leste magmatic suite. \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n \n\nThe Archean basement of the Caraj\u00e1s Domain consists mainly of gneiss-\n\nmigmatite-granulite terrains, generally related to the Xingu Complex (Docegeo, 1988; \n\nMachado et al., 1991; Pidgeon et al., 2000). Different models have been proposed to \n\nexplain the evolution of the Neoarchean volcano-sedimentary sequences, which include \n\nthe large sequence of metabasalts of the Gr\u00e3o Par\u00e1 Group (ca. 2.75 Ga; Machado et al., \n\n1991; Vasquez et al., 2008) and associated banded iron formations. An intra-plate rift \n\nmodel is presented in several studies (e.g., Gibbs et al., 1986; Villas and Santos, 2001) \n\nbut subduction-related environments have also been proposed (e.g., Dardenne et al., \n\n1988; Teixeira and Eggler, 1994). These volcano-sedimentary sequences are covered by \n\nlow-grade metamorphic sequences of clastic sedimentary rocks from the \u00c1guas Claras \n\nFormation (Ara\u00fajo et al., 1988).  \n\nSeveral mafic-ultramafic complexes intrude rocks of the Xingu Complex and the \n\nvolcanic-sedimentary sequences in the Caraj\u00e1s Domain (Docegeo, 1988; Ferreira Filho \n\net al., 2007). These intrusions host large Ni laterite deposits (e.g., On\u00e7a-Puma, \n\nVermelho, Jacar\u00e9) as well as PGE deposits (e.g., Luanga, Lago Grande). Distinct \n\nmagmatic structures and petrological evolution of the layered intrusions suggest that \n\nthey include different Neoarchean magmatic suites (e.g., Rosa, 2014; Siepierski, 2016; \n\nTeixeira et al., 2015).  \n\n \n\n2.2.2 - The Serra Leste Magmatic Suite  \n\n \n\n The Serra Leste Magmatic Suite (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007) consists of a cluster \n\nof small- to medium-size layered mafic-ultramafic intrusions located in the northeastern \n\nportion of the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province (Fig. 2.1). Mafic-ultramafic complexes are \n\nintrusive into gneiss and migmatites of the Xingu Complex and/or into volcano-\n\nsedimentary rocks of the Gr\u00e3o Par\u00e1 Group. This suite was originally grouped based on \n\nabundant PGE anomalies of the layered intrusions, disregarding geological, \n\nstratigraphic or petrological consideration (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007). Systematic \n\ngeological and petrological studies of the Lago Grande (Teixeira et al., 2015) and \n\nLuanga (Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016) Complexes provided the geological-\n\npetrological framework of the Serra Leste Magmatic Suite described in here. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n \n\n2.2.2.1 - Lago Grande Complex  \n\n \n\n  The Lago Grande Complex is a NE-trending medium-size (12 km long and \n\naverage 1.7 km wide) layered intrusion consisting mainly of mafic cumulate rocks \n\n(Mafic Zone) and minor ultramafic cumulates (Ultramafic Zone). Recent studies \n\n(Teixeira et al., 2015) indicate that igneous layers are overturned, such that the \n\nUltramafic Zone overly the Mafic Zone. The Ultramafic Zone comprises an up to 250 m \n\nthick sequence of interlayered harzburgite and orthopyroxenite at the base and \n\northopyroxenite at the top. The Mafic Zone consists of an up to 1000 m thick \n\nmonotonous sequence of gabbroic rocks. Primary igneous minerals are partially \n\nreplaced by metamorphic assemblages that indicate temperatures up to the amphibolite \n\nfacies of metamorphism. This metamorphic replacement is heterogeneous and \n\ncharacterized by an extensive hydration of primary minerals that largely preserves \n\nmagmatic textures and bulk chemical composition. PGE mineralizations occur in \n\nchromitites (up to 10 ppm) and associated with base metal sulfides in the Ultramafic \n\nZone (Teixeira et al., 2015).  \n\n \n\n2.2.2 Luanga Complex \n \n\n The Luanga Complex is a 6 km long and up to 3.5 km wide layered intrusion \n\n(Fig. 2.2) consisting, from base to top, of ultramafic cumulates (Ultramafic Zone), an \n\nintercalation of ultramafic and mafic cumulates (Transition Zone), and mafic cumulates \n\n(Mafic Zone). Similar to the configuration of the Lago Grande Complex, the Ultramafic \n\nZone overlies the Transition Zone, which overlies the Mafic Zone, suggesting thus that \n\nthe layered sequence in the Luanga Complex is also tectonically overturned (Fig. 2.2B; \n\nMansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016). The Ultramafic Zone comprises an up to 800 m thick \n\nsequence of serpentinite (i.e., metamorphosed peridotite) with thin (&lt;10 m thick) \n\ninterlayered orthopyroxenite lenses. The Transition Zone consists of an up to 800 m \n\nthick pile of interlayered ultramafic and mafic cumulate rocks. Interlayering of variably \n\ntextured orthopyroxenite, harzburgite and norite (Fig. 2.2C) in different scales (from \n\nfew centimeters up to hundreds of meters thick) is a remarkable feature of the Transition \n\nZone. Interlayering and reversals in cryptic variation of orthopyroxene and olivine in \n\nthe Transition Zone (Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016) support an open and dynamic \n\nmagmatic system. The Mafic Zone consists of an up to 2000 m thick sequence of  \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nmonotonous norite and minor interlayered orthopyroxenite (Fig. 2.2C). Chromitite \n\nlayers with variable thickness (from few centimeters up to 0.6 m thick) and textures \n\n(Fig. 2.3) occur mainly in the upper portions of the Transition Zone and the lowermost \n\nFig. 2.2: A) Geological map of the Luanga Complex (partially modified from unpublished report of \n\nVALE). Note the location of drill hole LUFD-079 referred to in this study. B) Geological section on \n\nthe central portion of the complex (partially modified from Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016). C) \n\nRepresentative stratigraphic column for the Luanga Complex (partially modified from Mansur and \n\nFerreira Filho, 2016). Note the variation of cumulus minerals through the stratigraphy \n\n\n\n \n\n58 \n \n\nportion of the Mafic Zone. Chromitites are better preserved in the central portion of the \n\ncomplex, where primary igneous textures and/or minerals prevail, becoming \n\ntectonically disturbed on its southern and northern limits (Mansur and Ferreira Filho, \n\n2016). PGE mineralizations occur associated with base metal sulfides in the contact \n\nzone of the Ultramafic and Transition Zones and associated with chromitite layers in the \n\nTransition Zone (Diella et al., 1995; Ferreira Filho et al., 2007).  \n\n \n\n2.3 - Sampling and analytical procedures \n \n\nFor this study, a drill hole representative of the Transition Zone in the central \n\nportion of the Luanga Complex was systematically sampled for unweathered rocks with \n\nprimary magmatic textures and minerals (drill hole LUFD-079; Fig. 2.2A and 2.2B). A \n\ntotal of 24 samples were collected for petrographic and mineral analyses, including one \n\nsample of each thin chromitite layers (06 samples), six samples from the thickest (~ 60 \n\ncm) chromitite layer, and 12 samples from host cumulate rocks (Fig. 2.3).  \n\n Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) photos were taken with a JEOL JCM-\n\n5000 Neoscope, at the Micropaleontology Laboratory of the University of Bras\u00edlia \n\n(Brazil), using carbon coating to enhance the contrast and definition. \n\n Mineral analyses were performed on polished thin section using a 5 wavelength \n\ndispersive (WDS) spectrometer JEOL JXA-8230 SuperProbe at the Electron \n\nMicroprobe Laboratory of the University of Bras\u00edlia (Brazil). Systematic WDS analyses \n\nwere obtained for chromite, orthopyroxene and plagioclase. Operating conditions for the \n\nWDS analyses were 15 kV accelerating voltage, with a beam current of 10 nA and \n\nprobe diameters of 3 ?m for chromite and orthopyroxene and 5 ?m for plagioclase. \n\nCount times on peak and on background were 10 sec and 5 sec, respectively. Using \n\nthese analytical conditions, detection limits are around 80 ppm. Both synthetic and \n\nnatural mineral standards were used for the analyses and the same standards and \n\nprocedure were retained throughout the analytical work. For chromite analysis, the \n\ncation compositions were calculated following the method described by Haggerty \n\n(1976) and Robin et al. (1992), Fe\n3+\n\n was calculated assuming perfect stoichiometry. \n\nChromite data are presented in terms of Cr# (100Cr/(Cr+Al+F\ne3+\n\n)), Fe\n3+\n\n# \n\n(100Fe\n3+\n\n/(Fe\n3+\n\n+Cr+Al)), Al# (100Al/(Al+Cr+Fe\n3+\n\n)), Mg# (100Mg/(Mg+Fe\n2+\n\n)) and  \n\nFe\n2+\n\n# (100Fe\n2+\n\n/(Fe\n2+\n\n+Mg)) throughout the paper. The complete dataset for chromite \n\nanalyses is given on the Online Supplementary Table A1.  \n\n\n\n \n\n59 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4 - Geology and stratigraphy through the drill hole LUFD-079 \n \n\nThe drill hole LUFD-079, located at the central portion of the Transition Zone \n\n(Fig. 2.2A and 2.2B), intersects several chromitite layers hosted by different rock types \n\n(Fig. 2.3).

The chromite-rich layers (Fig. 2.3) are divided into those \n\nlocated in the Transition Zone (Lower Group Chromitites - LGC), and those located in \n\nthe lowermost portion of the Mafic Zone (Upper Group Chromitites - UGC). \n\nHarzburgite is a medium- to coarse-grained olivine + chromite cumulate with \n\nintercumulus orthopyroxene. Coarse-grained harzburgite usually consists of large \n\northopyroxene oikocrysts enclosing several olivine crystals (Fig. 2.4A). The modal \n\ncomposition is variable due to different amount of interstitial minerals, including \n\nplagioclase as an additional common intercumulus mineral. Orthopyroxenite is a \n\nmedium- to coarse-grained rock with tabular orthopyroxene as cumulus mineral. The \n\ntexture varies from meso to orthocumulate with plagioclase as the predominant \n\nintercumulus mineral (Fig. 2.4B). The thickest chromitite layer (designated main \n\nchromitite) is ~ 60 cm thick and occurs at the contact between harzburgite and \n\northopyroxenite (Fig. 2.3). Norite is a medium-grained orthopyroxene and plagioclase \n\nadcumulate rock. A thin (i.e., 2-3 m thick) harzburgite layer always occur 15-20 cm \n\nbelow thin chromitite layers hosted by norite (Figs 2.3, 2.4C, 2.4D and 2.4E).  \n\nPrimary igneous minerals of these cumulate rocks are commonly partially \n\nreplaced by metamorphic assemblages. This replacement is heterogeneous and \n\ncharacterized by an extensive hydration that preserves primary textures and the \n\ncompositional domains of igneous minerals. These assemblages include serpentine + \n\ntalc + magnetite \u00b1 cummingtonite in replaced harzburgite, talc + serpentine + magnetite \n\n\u00b1 cummingtonite in replaced orthopyroxenite (Fig. 2.4B), and hornblende + chlorite + \n\nepidote in replaced norite. Metamorphic assemblages indicate temperatures up to the \n\namphibolite facies of metamorphism, thus consistent with those described in previous \n\nstudies of the Luanga (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007) and Lago Grande Complexes \n\n(Teixeira et al., 2015).  \n\n\n\n \n\n61 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 2.4: Textures in chromitites and host rocks from drill core LUFD-079 A) Coarse-grained \n\nharzburgite (Hzb) consisting of large orthopyroxene (Opx) oikocrysts enclosing several olivine (Ol - \n\nblack color) crystals and minor interstitial plagioclase (Plg - white color).

The main chromitite is an up to \n\n60 cm chromite-rich layer located at the contact between harzburgite and \n\northopyroxenite layers from the upper portion of the Transition Zone (LGC; Figs. 2.2C \n\nand 2.3). It has sharp contacts with both the underlying harzburgite and the overlying \n\northopyroxenite, suggesting abrupt changes in the sequence of cumulate minerals in \n\nboth contacts. The main chromitite extends for 1-2 hundred meters along strike, as \n\nindicated by drill core information, but the continuity beyond that is not constrained due \n\nto poor outcropping. Massive chromitite prevails (~ 65 vol. %) and is associated with \n\nirregular domains of chain-textured and disseminated chromitite (Figs. 2.3 and 2.5A). \n\nMassive chromitite is a fine- to medium-grained chromite cumulate with chromite \n\ngrains representing more than 50 vol. % (Fig. 2.5A). Orthopyroxene and plagioclase, \n\ncommonly replaced by fine-grained aggregates of serpentine, amphibole, chlorite and \n\ntalc, are typically the main interstitial minerals. Chromite occurs as euhedral to \n\nsubhedral annealed crystals with discrete alteration along crystal borders and fractures \n\n(Fig. 2.5B). Rounded silicate inclusions inside chromite grains are common and have \n\nvariable sizes (Fig. 2.5). These inclusions consist of the same fine-grained replacement \n\nminerals described for the matrix. Chain-textured chromitite, consisting of 15-20 vol. % \n\nchromite, is characterized by orthopyroxene pseudomorphs surrounded by dozens of \n\nmedium- to fine-grained chromite crystals (Figs. 2.5C). Fine-grained chromite grains \n\nare also enclosed by orthopyroxene pseudomorphs in chain-textures chromitites (Fig. \n\n2.5C). The transition from massive to chain-textured chromitite is gradational and \n\nmarked by the progressive decrease on the chromite modal composition. The same type \n\nof silicate inclusions observed in massive chromitites occurs in chain-textured \n\nchromitites, but they are less abundant in the latter. The disseminated chromitite \n\ncontains 5-10 vol. % of cumulus chromite and 95-90 vol. % of variably replaced \n\northopyroxene and plagioclase. Chromite grains in disseminated chromitite are \n\nextensively altered and rarely have silicate inclusions. Coarse-grained chromitite is \n\nrestricted to a 2 cm thick layer (see pegmatoid chromitite in Fig. 2.3) characterized by \n\ncoarse chromite grains containing a large volume of silicate inclusions (Fig. 2.5D). Both \n\ncoarse chromite crystals and silicate inclusions show irregular shapes in the pegmatoidal \n\nchromitite (Fig. 2.5D), different from  \n\n\n\n \n\n63 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 2.5: Textures in chromitites.

Note that chromite grains are \n\npartially altered along borders and fractures (light gray color). C) Photomicrograph of chain-textured \n\nchromitite. Chromite crystals are interstitial to orthopyroxene pseudomorphs replaced by amphibole \n\n(Amp) and talc (Tlc).

All \n\nthree types of chromitites are cross-cut by fine grained amphibole-chlorite-carbonate \n\nveinlets (Fig. 2.5E). These veinlets do not appear to extensively affect the composition \n\nof chromite grains (i.e., no significant zonation or reaction border is observed).  \n\n Thin chromitites (&lt;10 cm thick) are mainly hosted by noritic rocks of the Mafic \n\nZone (UGC; Fig. 2.3). These chromitites are fine- to medium-grained chromite \n\ncumulates with intercumulus plagioclase and orthopyroxene (Fig. 2.4E). Chromite \n\ngrains are euhedral and show many rounded silicate inclusions with well-developed \n\ninner rims (Fig. 2.5F). These inclusions consist of the same aggregate of fine-grained \n\nsilicates that replace the original intercumulus minerals in the main chromitite of the \n\nLGC. Locally, sulfide minerals occur at the bottom of the inclusions, facing the base of \n\nthe chromitite layer (i.e., based on oriented thin sections; Fig. 2.5G). \n\n \n\n2.5.2 - Spatial analysis of silicate inclusions and their variation through the \n\nstratigraphy \n \n\n Silicate inclusions and \u201catoll-like\u201d structures are common features in chromite \n\ngrains of the studied chromitites (Fig. 2.5). The three-dimensional shape of these \n\ninclusions and hosting crystals were described utilizing a SEM (Fig. 2.6). Chromite \n\ngrains are euhedral with well-defined faces without any indication of reaction or \n\nreabsorption features (Fig. 2.6A). Inclusion-bearing crystals have the same morphology \n\nof inclusion-free crystals, except for the presence of predominantly rounded inclusions \n\nin the first (Fig. 2.6B). Inclusion-bearing chromite grains usually have the inclusions \n\nlocked within the crystals, with no physical connection of the included silicates and \n\noutside matrix minerals. However, few silicate inclusions are connected with the outside \n\nFig. 2.5 (cont.) : D) Photomicrograph (crossed polarizers) of pegmatoid chromitite.

E) Photomicrograph (crossed polarizers) \n\nof carbonate (Cc)-amphibole-talc veinlet cross cutting massive chromitite.

Chromite grains from the LGC commonly have just one large silicate inclusion \n\n(Fig. 2.7A). The thin pegmatoid chromitite (Fig. 2.3) has chromite crystals with the \n\nlarger silicate inclusions (up to 0.65 mm of diameter enclosed within chromite crystals \n\naround 1 mm diameter) of all the studied samples (Fig. 2.7B).

Orthopyroxene was analysed in \n\nsamples of orthopyroxenite and harzburgite from the Transition Zone and norite from \n\nthe Mafic Zone, while plagioclase was just analysed in samples of norite from the Mafic \n\nZone. Representative analyses of orthopyroxene and plagioclase are reported in Tables \n\n2.1 and 2.2, respectively.  \n\n  Orthopyroxene compositions range from En83.49 to En89.9 mol % through the \n\ntop of the Transition Zone and the base of the Mafic Zone (Fig. 2.8). The cryptic \n\nvariation of orthopyroxene shows a few reversals and relatively more fractionated \n\ncompositions (En83.49 to En86.45 mol %) in the Transition Zone, whereas the \n\ncompositions of orthopyroxene in norite of the Mafic Zone are more primitive (En89.0 \n\nto En89.84 mol %) (Fig. 2.8). Plagioclase compositions range from An76.61 to An83.20 \n\nmol % in the lower portion of the Mafic Zone. The cryptic variation of plagioclase \n\nshows a consistent upward increase in An contents, indicating a reversed fractionation \n\nin the lower portion of the Mafic Zone (Fig. 2.8). Cryptic variations of orthopyroxene \n\nand plagioclase in drill core LUFD-079 are consistent with the common reversals within \n\na general inversed fractionation trend of the Transition Zone and lower portion of the \n\nMafic Zone, as described in previous studies of the Luanga Complex (Ferreira Filho et \n\nal., 2007; Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016). \n\n2.6.2 \u2013 Chromite \n \n\n Chromite grains show alteration rims (Figs. 2.5 and 2.7) that are probably \n\nassociated with different compositions. In order to evaluate the compositional variation \n\nin chromite grains, EMP analyses were performed on line transverses through 35 \n\nchromite crystals with different morphologies (Fig. 2.9 shows 4 representative line \n\ntraverses), totaling ~ 700 analyses. Investigated chromite crystals were separated into \n\ninclusion-free and inclusion-bearing crystals (see Table 2.3 and Table 2.4 for \n\nrepresentative analyses from line traverses of inclusion-free and inclusion-bearing \n\ncrystals, respectively). An outer alteration rim characterized by higher reflectance (see \n\nFig. 2.9B) is common in both inclusion-free and inclusion-bearing crystals. These \n\nalteration rims have variable thickness and are commonly continuous along fractures in \n\n\n\n \n\n68 \n \n\nextensively altered chromite crystals. Composition of chromite changes abruptly in this \n\nouter rim, becoming enriched in Fe\n3+\n\n and Fe\n2+\n\n (i.e., Fe\n3+\n\n# up to 91) at the expense of \n\nMg, Cr, Al. This alteration is easily recognized in petrographic studies and have highly \n\ndifferent compositions compared with the core of the crystals. These rims were avoided \n\nin the systematic probe investigation and analyses are limited to few line traverses. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 2.8: Compositional variations of orthopyroxene (Opx), plagioclase (Plg) and chromite \n\nthroughout drill core LUFD-079.

Line traverses through inclusion-free crystals \n \n\n Inclusion-free crystals have a core-to-rim variation in composition (or concentric \n\nrim) that varies in thickness according to the modal percentage of chromite. Chromite \n\ncrystals from massive chromitites (i.e., > 50 vol % of chromite) have thinner concentric \n\nrims compared with chain-textured and disseminated chromitites (i.e., &lt;50 vol % of \n\nchromite). Line traverses through inclusion-free crystals (Figs. 2.9A and 2.9B) show \n\nsignificant progressive core to rim changes in Mg# (i.e., a Mg-Fe core-rim zoning). The \n\ncore of the crystals has higher Mg and lower Fe\n2+\n\n contents than the rims, resulting in an \n\nup to 40% difference in Mg# across a chromite crystal. Difference in Mg# from core to \n\nrim progressively decreases for chromitites with higher amount of intercumulus \n\nminerals, as illustrated by line traverses through chromite crystals from massive (Fig. \n\n2.9A), chain-textured (Fig. 2.9B) and disseminated (Fig. 2.9C) chromitites. This feature \n\n(i.e., the progressively lower difference in Mg# for chromitites with higher amounts of \n\nintercumulus minerals) is matched with progressively lower Mg# in the core of \n\nchromite grains. Significant differences in Mg# of chromite crystals suggest extensive \n\nMg and Fe\n2+\n\n exchange, a subject to be addressed in the discussion of this study. The \n\nCr#, Al# and Fe\n3+\n\n# are constant in line traverses through different types of chromite \n\ncrystals (Figs. 2.9A, 2.9B and 2.9C), except for few analyses located in the outer bright \n\ncolored rim in some crystals (not analysed for line traverses represented in Figs. 2.9A, \n\n2.9B and 2.9C). This feature indicates that the suggested extensive exchange between \n\ndivalent cations in chromite crystals (i.e., Mg and Fe\n2+\n\n) does not affect trivalent cations \n\n(i.e., Cr, Al and Fe\n3+\n\n).  \n\n2.6.2.2 - Line traverses through inclusion-bearing crystals \n \n\n Inclusion-bearing crystals (Figs. 2.5G, 2.5H and 2.7) have an outer alteration \n\nrim, similar to the one described for inclusion-free crystals, and a variably developed \n\nrim adjacent to the silicate inclusions (Fig. 2.9D). The latter, designated inner rim, has a \n\ndistinctive morphology consisting of rounded contacts with the silicate inclusion and a \n\ncharacteristic sector zoning following the octahedral form of the hosting chromite \n\ncrystals (Fig. 2.9D). The existence and/or extent of the inner rim do not have any \n\nsystematic relation with the size of host chromite crystal and silicate inclusion, the \n\nnumber of inclusions, or the chromite modal percentage and texture of the chromitite. \n\nLine traverses through inclusion-bearing crystals (Fig. 2.9D) indicate significant \n\ncompositional changes close to silicate inclusions. \n\n\n\n \n\n75 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 2.9: EMP Back-scattered images of chromite grains analysed in line transverses and plots of the \n\nresults.

D) Inclusion-bearing chromite grain from a thin chromitite of \n\nthe Mafic Zone. \n\n\n\n \n\n76 \n \n\nCompared to the host chromite, compositions within the rims adjacent to silicate \n\ninclusions have higher Cr#, lower Al# and Mg# and similar Fe\n3+\n\n# (Fig. 2.9D). These \n\nrelative compositional changes are described for all studied rims regardless the size \n\nand/or composition of the host chromite.  \n\n2.6.2.3 - Cryptic variation of chromite \n \n\nLine traverses across chromite crystals of several chromitites from drill core \n\nLUFD-079 indicate that chromite compositions are highly variable for each sample. \n\nCompositional variation occurs within a single grain (i.e., zoning) as well as when \n\ndifferent grains from the same sample are compared. These compositional variations \n\npose limits for the use of chromite composition as a parameter for the composition and \n\nfractionation of the parental magma. The cryptic variation study of chromite through \n\ndrill core LUFD-079 (Fig. 2.8) includes just compositions obtained in homogenous core \n\nof inclusion-free chromite crystals from chain-textured or massive chromitites. These \n\ncompositions are interpreted to be close to primary crystallization compositions and \n\nlargely reduce the variability resulting from zoned crystals. \n\nChromite compositions in crystals from chromitites through drill core LUFD-\n\n079 indicate an increase in Al# along with a decrease in Cr# (Fig. 2.8). Cr# and Al# of \n\nLGC (including samples from the main chromitite), respectively 45-54 and 32-44, are \n\ndistinctively different from those obtained in UGC, respectively 36-42 and 52-58. The \n\nFe\n3+\n\n# follows the Cr# and decrease from LGC (6-19) to UGC (1-9). The Mg# in \n\nchromite is largely controlled by textural features of chromite and the modal \n\ncomposition of the chromitite, as indicated in the description of line traverses. Mg# are \n\nlow and close to ~ 20 for all chromitites, except for higher and highly variable values \n\n(30-66) for samples of the main chromitite. The low values of Mg# obtained for most \n\nchromitites are likely to result from later alteration processes and, therefore, not useful \n\nas an indication of magmatic evolution.  \n\nChromite compositions in crystals from samples through the main chromitite do \n\nnot provide any significant base-to-top compositional trend (Fig. 2.10). Cr# and Al# in \n\nchromite crystals show negative correlation and a limited compositional range, \n\nrespectively 47-51 and 36-42., except for the unusually Fe\n3+\n\n rich (8-15) and Cr-poor \n\n(45-50) uppermost sample. Highly variable Mg# (22-62) are likely to result from \n\nheterogeneous effects of alteration processes, as previously described for other \n\nchromitites from drill core LUFD-079. \n\n\n\n \n\n77 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.7 -  Discussion \n \n\n2.7.1 - Magmatic compositions of chromite  \n, \n\n The extensive database of chromite analyses (~ 700 analyses) for chromitites of \n\nthe Luanga Complex obtained in this study indicates a large range of compositions. \n\nTwo common projections of the spinel compositional prism, the triangular Cr-Al-Fe\n3+\n\n \n\nplot (Fig. 2.11) and the plot of Fe\n2+\n\n/(Mg+Fe\n2+\n\n) vs Cr/(Cr+Al) (Fig. 2.12), are used to \n\nillustrate the compositional variation of chromite in chromitites. Results indicate that \n\nLGC have distinctively higher Cr# compared with UGC. The upward decrease of Cr# in \n\nchromitites of the Luanga Complex matches the fractionation of the magma from \n\nultramafic cumulates (olivine and/or orthopyroxene cumulates) in the Transition Zone \n\nto plagioclase-bearing cumulates in the Mafic Zone (Fig. 2.8). Our results also indicate \n\nFig. 2.10: Compositional variations of chromite throughout the main chromitite of the Transition \n\nZone (see stratigraphic section in Fig. 3 for orientation). Chromite compositions are expressed in \n\nterms of Al# = 100Al/(Al + Cr + Fe\n3+\n\n), Cr# = 100Cr/(Cr + Al + Fe\n3+\n\n), Fe\n3+\n\n# = 100Fe\n3+\n\n/(Fe\n3+\n\n + Cr + \n\nAl) and Mg# = 100Mg/(Mg + Fe\n2+\n\n). Modal % indicates the chromite percentage of each sample. The \n\nblack bar indicates the variation for each sample. \n\n\n\n \n\n78 \n \n\nthat compositions of chromite from the UGC are distinctively different from those \n\nhosted in chromitites from continental layered intrusions (Fig. 2.12). While most \n\nchromitites in continental layered intrusions are located within ultramafic cumulates, \n\nour results for the UGC add another case for the few examples of chromitites hosted \n\nwithin mafic cumulate (e.g., Rum layered intrusion, Henderson, 1975; Upper Group \n\nchromitites of the Bushveld Complex, Eales and Reynolds, 1986). Due to extensive Fe\n+2\n\n \n\nand Mg compositional variation in chromite, our data is highly scattered in a Fe# vs Cr# \n\nplot (Fig. 2.12). Therefore, typical trends indicating either a positive correlation \n\nbetween Fe# (or otherwise a negative correlation if Mg# is plotted) and Cr# (known as \n\nthe Cr-Al trend by Barnes and Roeder, 2001), or a negative correlation (known as the \n\nRum trend by Barnes and Roeder, 2001) are not obvious for chromitites from the \n\nLuanga Complex (Fig. 2.12). Nevertheless, the very low Cr# of the UGC and the abrupt \n\nupward decrease in Cr# from the LGC to the UGC are remarkable compositional \n\nfeatures. Lower Cr# in the UGC results from the increase in Al at the expense of Cr and \n\nsome Fe\n3+\n\n (Fig. 2.8 and 2.12). The upward decrease in the Cr# through a layered \n\nintrusion has been ascribed to the depletion of Cr in the melt during fractionation \n\n(Irvine, 1977; Hulbert and Von Gruenewaldt, 1985). However, the content of TiO2 in \n\nchromite from chromitites of the Luanga Complex (Fig. 2.8) does not show an upward \n\nincrease as expected for progressively more fractionated magmas. It should also be \n\nnoted that chromite in the Upper Group of the Bushveld Complex chromitites have \n\nhigher Cr# compared with chromite in the underlying Middle Group chromitites, a \n\nfeature interpreted as the result of reduced Al2O3 activity by the appearance of cumulus \n\nplagioclase in cumulates hosting the Upper Group chromitites (Eales and Marsh, 1983; \n\nNaldrett et al., 2009). The previous discussion suggests that the unusual composition of \n\nthe UGC chromitites are not satisfactory explained by models and processes indicated \n\nfor chromitites from other locations. We suggest that compositions of the UGC \n\nchromite may be linked to petrological processes associated with peridotites underlying \n\neach chromitite, an issue addressed in the following discussion. \n\n\n\n \n\n79 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 2.11: Ternary plot (Fe\n3+\n\n#-Cr#-Al# of chromites from chromitites of the Luanga Complex.

C) Analyses of \n\nchromite from a line traverse of one representative chromite crystal from the chromitites indicated in \n\nB). The field of chromite compositions in layered intrusions is from Barnes and Roeder (2001). \n\n\n\n \n\n80 \n \n\n2.7.2 - Petrological implications of the stratigraphic distribution of chromitites \n \n\nAs commonly described in layered intrusions, chromitites in the Luanga \n\nComplex occur in specific stratigraphic intervals with distinct petrological \n\ncharacteristics. Chromitites occur mainly in the upper portions of the Transition Zone \n\nand through the immediate contact with the Mafic Zone (Fig. 2.2C), a stratigraphic \n\ninterval consisting of several cyclic units interpreted as the result of successive influxes \n\nof parental magma (Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016). Different models were proposed \n\nto explain the common association of chromitites and cyclic units. They include, among \n\nothers, the mixing of an injection of primitive magma with a more fractionated magma \n\nresiding in the magma chamber, thus causing chromite to be the sole liquidus mineral \n\n(e.g., Irvine, 1977) and the result of slumping of semi-consolidated cumulates in a \n\nchromite-rich slurry (e.g., Mondal and Mathez, 2007; Maier and Barnes 2008; \n\nVoordouw et al., 2009). It is not the aim of this paper to discuss the processes that lead \n\nto the accumulation of chromite-rich layers, a highly controversial subject (see Mondal \n\nand Mathez, 2007 and Naldrett et al., 2012 for reviews and references). We rather want \n\nto focus on possible petrological implications provided by the stratigraphic sequence \n\nassociated with chromitites in the Mafic Zone (Fig. 2.3). Thin chromitites hosted by \n\nnoritic rocks are always preceded by a thin layer of harzburgite located 15-20 cm below \n\neach chromitite layer (Figs 2.4C to E). Because this unusual stratigraphic association of \n\nharzburgite and chromitite is consistently repeated, a petrological link of harzburgite \n\nlayers and chromitites located above them is suggested. Thin chromitites closely \n\nassociated with peridotite-troctolite are also reported in the Rum Complex (O'Driscoll et \n\nal., 2010). Although chromitites in the Rum Complex occur mainly at the base of \n\nseveral peridotite-troctolite cyclic units, thin chromitites also occur a few centimeters \n\naway from the basal peridotite. O'Drisoll et al. (2010) suggested that chromitites were \n\nformed by in situ crystallization following assimilation of troctolitic cumulate by a new \n\ninflux of primitive magma at the crystal mush-magma interface. The authors' also \n\nsuggested that chromitites located above the unit boundaries resulted from coeval syn-\n\nmagmatic deformation of the crystal mush. This interpretation may be also applied for \n\nchromitites hosted in noritic rocks of the Luanga Complex. When the new influx of \n\nprimitive magma assimilated norite the concentration (and thus activity) of Al2O3 \n\nshould have increased. The relatively lower Cr# and Fe\n+3\n\n of chromite in the UGC may \n\nresult from an increase in Al2O3 activity right in the crystal mush-primitive magma \n\ninterface, just preceding the first appearance of liquidus plagioclase. This suggesting \n\n\n\n \n\n81 \n \n\nfollows O'Driscoll et al. (2010) idea that unusually aluminous composition of chromite \n\nin the Rum Complex resulted from high Al2O3 content of hybrid liquids originated from \n\nassimilation of plagioclase-rich cumulate from a picritic magma. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.7.3 - Compositional zonation in chromite grains and its implications for the \n\ninterpretation of chromite compositions \n \n\n Our results indicate that extensive compositional variation occurs in different \n\nscales, as indicated by large variation obtained in analyses of one chromitite (Fig. 2.11B \n\nand 2.12B) or even within a chromite crystal (Fig. 2.11C and 2.12C). Compositional \n\ntraverses in chromite crystals from several chromitites of the Luanga Complex indicate \n\nthree distinct types of rim or compositional zoning: i. an outer alteration rim, ii. a Mg-\n\nFe core-rim zoning, iii. an inner rim adjacent to silicate inclusions. Distinct textures and \n\ncompositions of these three types of rim or zoning suggest that they originated from \n\ndifferent processes. \n\nFig. 2.12: Fe\n2+\n\n/(Mg + Fe\n2+\n\n) versus Cr/(Cr + Al) of chromites from chromitites of the Luanga \n\nComplex. A) Chromite analyses from all chromitites investigated. B) Analyses of chromite from one \n\nchromitite of the Transition Zone (Lower Group) and one of the Mafic Zone (Upper Group). C) \n\nAnalyses of chromite from a traverse section of one representative chromite crystal from the \n\nchromitites indicated in B). The field of chromite compositions in layered intrusions is from Barnes \n\nand Roeder (2001). \n\n\n\n \n\n82 \n \n\n An outer alteration rim characterized by higher reflectance (see Fig. 2.9B and \n\nphotomicrographs in Sack and Ghiorso, 1991) is common in chromite crystals from \n\nchromitites overprinted by metamorphism, especially under lower to intermediate \n\ngrades of the regional metamorphism (i.e., up to amphibolite facies) (e.g., Evans and \n\nFrost, 1975; Sack and Ghiorso, 1991; Liipo et al., 1995). This alteration is also common \n\nin chromite crystals in serpentinized and/or hydrothermally altered mafic-ultramafic \n\nrocks (e.g., Barnes and Roeder, 2001; Mukherjee et al., 2010). The composition of \n\nchromite in samples of the Luanga Complex changes abruptly in the outer rim, \n\nbecoming enriched in Fe\n3+\n\n and Fe\n2+\n\n at the expense of Mg, Cr, Al, thus moving toward \n\nthe magnetite apex on the spinel prism. The formation of the outer rim is probably \n\nrelated to the metamorphic replacement of the primary mineralogy of the Luanga \n\nComplex. This interpretation is supported by progressively larger outer rims in chromite \n\nassociated with extensively replaced rocks. While chromite grains are commonly \n\ncompletely altered to magnetite-ferrichromite in extensively replaced rocks, chromite \n\nenclosed in relicts of olivine or orthopyroxene have just minor alteration along \n\nfractures. Once this alteration is easily recognized in petrographic studies and have \n\nhighly different compositions compared with the core, analyses of the outer rim were \n\ndisregarded as far as the magmatic and sub-solidus interpretation of chromite \n\ncompositions of the Luanga Complex is concerned. \n\n The Mg-Fe zoning in chromite crystals has a strong correlation with the modal \n\npercentage of chromite in a given layer (Fig. 2.9A to 2.9C). This is indicated by thinner \n\nconcentric rims in chromite crystals from massive chromitites (i.e., > 50 vol % of \n\nchromite) compared with chain-textured and disseminated chromitites (i.e., &lt;50 vol % \n\nof chromite), and has been described in several studies of chromitites (e.g., \n\nDanyushevsky et al., 2000; Marques and Ferreira Filho, 2003; Spandler et al., 2005). \n\nThe Mg-Fe zoning in chromite crystals results of significant core-to-rim difference in \n\nFe\n2+\n\n and Mg contents with none to minor difference in Fe\n3+\n\n, Al and Cr contents. The \n\nprogressive core-to-rim decrease in Mg# of chromite crystals may result either from an \n\nevolving melt composition during crystallization, or by subsolidus exchange of Fe\n2+\n\n and \n\nMg between chromite and coexisting silicates during slow cooling of the intrusion. The \n\nfirst option is favored by the progressive fractionation of the trapped intercumulus \n\nliquid coexisting with cumulus chromite (e.g., Henderson and Wood, 1981; Roeder and \n\nCampbell, 1985). However, the fractionated trapped melt should become enriched in \n\nTiO2 and Fe\n3+\n\n and therefore, a negative correlation of Mg# and Fe\n3+\n\n# along with TiO2 \n\n\n\n \n\n83 \n \n\ncontents would be expected for Mg-Fe zoned chromite crystals. Because these \n\ncorrelations do not occur in the Mg-Fe zoned crystals of the Luanga Complex (Fig. 2.9), \n\nthe first option is not an appropriate interpretation. The second option demands an \n\nextensive exchange between divalent cations hosted in tetrahedral sites in chromite \n\ncrystals (i.e., Mg and Fe\n2+\n\n) and coexisting silicates. This extensive exchange would not \n\nbe accompanied with exchange between trivalent cations hosted in octahedral sites (i.e., \n\nCr, Al and Fe\n3+\n\n) in chromite and coexisting silicates due to their lower diffusion rates \n\n(Sack and Ghiorso, 1991). The second option has been proposed as an explanation for \n\nFe\n2+\n\n and Mg variation across chromite grains in chromitites (e.g., Danyushevsky et al., \n\n2000; Spier and Ferreira Filho, 2001; Spandler et al., 2005), and provides an appropriate \n\ninterpretation for Mg-Fe zoned chromite crystals of the Luanga Complex. \n\n Inclusion-bearing chromite crystals have the same Mg-Fe zoning but also show \n\nadditional inner rims adjacent to the silicate inclusions (Fig. 2.9D). The chromite \n\ncomposition adjacent to the silicate inclusion (i.e., in the inner rim) have higher Cr#, \n\nlower Mg# and Al#, and similar Fe\n3+\n\n# (Fig. 2.9D), possibly due to crystallization from a \n\nprogressively more fractionationed liquid trapped in the chromite crystal (i.e., following \n\nthe process suggested for progressive fractionation of the trapped intercumulus liquid by \n\nHenderson and Wood, 1981). Borisova et al. (2012) describe chromites with similar \n\ncompositional variation in coronas adjacent to silicate inclusions from the Oman \n\nophiolite. Based on the hydrous Na-Cl-rich composition of the melt inclusions, the \n\nauthors proposed a subsolidus process for the origin of the coronas in chromite from the \n\nOman ophiolite, suggesting that hydrothermal or metamorphic processes induced higher \n\nCr# in chromite close to the hydrous silicate inclusions. Because silicate inclusions in \n\nthe Luanga Complex are eventually connected to intercumulus minerals, and no \n\nevidence for hydrous Na-Cl melt inclusions exists, such a hydrothermal-metamorphic \n\nprocess is not favored for the inner rim coronas described in our study. In particular, \n\nreaction of Cr-spinel with intercumulus liquid, as suggested for the inner rim coronas of \n\nthe Luanga Complex, results in both divalent (Fe\n2+\n\n and Mg) and trivalent (Cr, Al, Fe,) \n\ncation exchange. On the other hand, subsolidus reaction of Cr-spinel and intercumulus \n\nsilicates, as suggested for the Fe-Mg zoning, results mainly in exchange of divalent \n\ncations. \n\n Our results indicate that chromite compositions from chromitites of the Luanga \n\nComplex (Figs. 2.11 and 2.12) have their primary cumulus composition extensively \n\n\n\n \n\n84 \n \n\nmodified by postcumulus magmatic processes. Although distinct primary magmatic \n\ncompositions are indicated by different Cr# for chromites from the Transition Zone and \n\nMafic Zone, the extensive variation of Mg# for a single chromite crystal indicates that \n\nthe compositional field of the Luanga Complex chromitites are not entirely primary \n\nmagmatic. Due to the indicated modification of primary magmatic compositions, it is \n\ncritical to determine what range of compositions of the Luanga Complex chromites \n\nrepresents the closest composition of original cumulus chromite. These are the \n\ncompositions useful for defining magmatic trends and/or comparison with other layered \n\nintrusions. Mass balance arguments are commonly used to indicate that massive \n\nchromitites with > 70 % vol. chromite are likely to preserve its original igneous \n\ncompositions because there are few other phases available for element exchange (e.g., \n\nEales and Reynolds, 1986). This reasoning was used in several studies of chromitites \n\n(e.g., Bacuri Complex, Spier and Ferreira Filho, 2001; Ipueira-Medrado Sill, Marques \n\nand Ferreira Filho, 2003), but is not appropriate for chromitites of the Luanga Complex, \n\nwhere modal compositions rarely exceed 70 vol. %. Our results suggest, in fact, that just \n\nthe compositions from analyses in the very core of chromite from massive portions of \n\nthe main chromitite (e.g., Fig. 2.9A) represent compositions close to original cumulus \n\ncompositions of the Luanga Complex. None of the other analyses represent cumulus \n\ncompositions. These altered compositions represent > 90 % of the analyses of this \n\nstudy, including all analyses of chromite from chromitites of the Mafic Zone. The range \n\nof chromite compositions likely to represent primary cumulus composition for \n\nchromitites of the Transition Zone, as well as the range of Fe\n+2\n\n-Mg exchange, is \n\nindicated in figure 2.13. The range of cumulus compositions of chromite of the \n\nTransition Zone is restricted to analyses with high Mg# in the core of chromite from \n\nmassive portions of the main chromitite (as indicated in Fig. 2.9A). \n\n The extensive modification of primary cumulus composition of chromite, \n\nindicated in our study for the Luanga Complex, is likely to be common in non-massive \n\nchromitites (i.e., &lt;70 vol. % chromite), and the rule for disseminated chromites in \n\nmafic intrusions. Therefore, the common use of spinel compositions as a petrogenetic \n\nindicator for mafic intrusions (e.g., Sack and Ghiorso, 1991; Power et al., 2000; Barnes \n\nand Roeder, 2001) should be considered with caution and always supported by \n\nextensive petrographic/analytical investigation of post-magmatic alteration.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n85 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.7.4 - Why different types of inclusion-bearing chromite crystals are formed? \n \n\n Silicate inclusions of distinct types are common in chromitites through the \n\nstratigraphy of the Luanga Complex (Figs. 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7). Different models have been \n\nproposed to explain the formation of silicate inclusions in chromite (e.g., Aug\u00e9, 1987; \n\nBallhaus and Stumpfl, 1986; Hulbert and Von Gruenewaldt, 1985; Li et al., 2005; \n\nLorand and Cottin, 1987; Lorand and Ceulenner, 1989; Roeder et al., 2001; Spandler et \n\nal., 2005). It is beyond the scope of this article to enter into a thorough discussion of the \n\nmechanisms of formation of these inclusions, and just a parallel of our observation and \n\navailable models is considered in here.  \n\n Based on the size and number of inclusions, the inclusion-bearing chromite \n\ngrains of the Luanga Complex split into two groups. LGC commonly have chromite \n\ncrystals with just one large inclusion (Fig. 2.7A), while UGC consist mainly of chromite \n\nFig. 2.13: Fe\n2+\n\n/(Mg + Fe\n2+\n\n) versus Cr/(Cr + Al) of chromites from chromitites of the Luanga Complex. \n\nThe field of primary cumulus composition for chromitites of the Transition Zone (1) is indicated. The \n\nfield of chromite compositions in layered intrusions is from Barnes and Roeder (2001). \n\n\n\n \n\n86 \n \n\ngrains with several small inclusions (Fig. 2.7C). Both groups show inclusion \n\ncoalescence (Figs. 2.5E and 2.6D), minor accumulation of sulfides at the bottom of \n\ninclusions (Fig. 2.5G) and rounded shapes (Figs. 2.5 to 2.7). These features support the \n\nconcept that inclusions were formed due to the entrapment of melt during chromite \n\ngrowth, a process that requires fast growth rate as described for chromite grains in \n\nkomatiites (e.g., Arndt et al., 1977; Barnes 1985; Godel et al., 2013) and modern picritic \n\nbasalts (Roeder et al., 2001). High growth rate allows the crystallization of chromite \n\nwith skeletal shapes and the entrapment of melt between dendritic branches (Fig. 2.14). \n\nDifferent types of inclusion-bearing crystals, as described for chromitites from different \n\nstratigraphic portions of the Luanga Complex, would thus require different growth rates \n\nduring the evolution of the complex. Chromite crystals hosting just one large inclusion \n\ndemand lower growth rates than those hosting several inclusions, thus allowing the \n\ncoalescence between the entrapped liquid and the development of just one inclusion \n\n(Fig. 2.14A). On the other hand, chromite crystals hosting several inclusions are formed \n\nunder higher growth rates, allowing the entrapment of many physically isolated melt \n\ndroplets in each crystal (Fig. 2.14B). High growth rate in chromite is generally related \n\nto high diffusion and cooling rates (Arndt et al., 1977; Barnes and Hill, 1995; Godel et \n\nal., 2013). This reasoning suggests that the entrapment of many silicate melt droplets \n\nwithin UGC is a response to higher cooling rates, caused by new primitive magma \n\ninjections within mafic cumulates. In contrast, chromite crystals from LGC would have \n\na slower growth rate due to no major difference in temperature between primitive \n\nmagmas and hosting ultramafic cumulates.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n87 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 2.14: Schematic model and phtomicrographs illustrating the crystallization of different inclusion-\n\nbearing chromite grains.

B) Crystallization of inclusion-bearing chromite crystals from chromitite of the Mafic Zone \n\n(Upper Group). \n\n\n\n \n\n88 \n \n\n2.8 - Conclusions  \n \n\nThe principal conclusions of this study are as follows:  \n\na) Chromitites in the Luanga Complex occur mainly in the upper portions of the \n\nTransition Zone, where they are hosted by ultramafic cumulates, and through the \n\nimmediate contact with the overlying Mafic Zone, where they are hosted by \n\nplagioclase-bearing cumulates. This stratigraphic interval consists of several cyclic units \n\ninterpreted as the result of successive influxes of primitive magma. \n\nb) Chromite crystals in chromitites from the Transition Zone (i.e., Lower Group \n\nChromitites - LGC) have distinctively higher Cr# compared with chromite crystals in \n\nchromitites from the Mafic Zone (i.e., Upper Group Chromitites - UGC). The upward \n\ndecrease of Cr# in chromitites of the Luanga Complex matches the fractionation of the \n\nmagma from ultramafic cumulates (olivine and/or orthopyroxene cumulates) in the \n\nTransition Zone to plagioclase-bearing cumulates in the Mafic Zone. \n\nc) Extensive modification of primary cumulus composition of chromite in chromitite of \n\nthe Luanga Complex is indicated by rimmed and/or extensively zoned chromite crystal. \n\nZoned chromite indicates an extensive exchange between divalent (Mg, Fe\n2+\n\n) cations \n\nand minor to none exchange between trivalent cations (Cr, Al and Fe\n3+\n\n), and should \n\nresult of subsolidus exchange of Fe\n2+\n\n and Mg between chromite and coexisting silicates \n\nduring slow cooling of the intrusion. \n\nd) Significant modification of primary cumulus composition of chromite, as indicated in \n\nour study for the Luanga Complex, is likely to be common in non-massive chromitites \n\nand the rule for disseminated chromites in mafic intrusions. Therefore, the common use \n\nof spinel compositions as a petrogenetic indicator for mafic intrusions should be \n\nconsidered with caution. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements  \n\n \n\nThis study was supported by CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico \n\ne Teconol\u00f3gico) and VALE S.A.

Getulio Vargas, 671/13\u00ba, 30112-020, Belo Horizonte, MG, \n\nBrazil \n\n \n\nAbstract  \n \n\nThe Luanga Complex, located in the eastern portion of the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province, \n\nhosts the largest Brazilian PGE deposit. The deposit is hosted by a sequence of layered \n\nultramafic and mafic cumulates and has two distinct styles of PGE mineralization. The \n\nfirst, ascribed as Sulfide Zone, consists of a 10 \u2013 50 m thick interval with disseminated \n\nsulfides located along the contact of the Ultramafic and Transition Zones of the \n\nintrusion. The mineralogy of the Sulfide Zone consists of base metal sulfides with \n\npentlandite > pyrrhotite > >> chalcopyrite. The other PGE mineralization, ascribed as \n\nsilicate-related PGE, consists of 2-10 m thick stratabound zones across the Transition \n\nZone. These sulfide- and chromite-free rocks, mainly harzburgite and orthopyroxenite, \n\ndo not show any distinctive texture or change in modal composition that characterize \n\nthe PGE enrichment. The Sulfide Zone hosts the bulk of PGE resources of the Luanga \n\nComplex (i.e., 142 Mt at 1.24 ppm Pt+Pd+Au and 0.11% Ni). The Sulfide Zone and \n\nsilicate-related PGE show differences in geochemistry behavior of PGE. The Sulfide \n\nZone has Pt/Pd ratios of 0.55 and a positive correlation between all PGE and S. The \n\nsilicate-related PGE has Pt/Pd ratios of 1.2-1.3 and a strong depletion in IPGE. A \n\nremarkable feature is the occurrence of anomalously Ni-rich olivines (up to 7400 ppm \n\nNi) in harzburgites closely associated with silicate-related PGE mineralization. The \n\ngeochemical and textural differences between these mineralization styles suggest that \n\nthey were formed by distinct geological processes. Our results supports that the Sulfide-\n\nZone is formed by typical segregation of a sulfide immiscible liquid during fractional \n\n\n\n \n\n98 \n \n\ncrystallization. However, silicate-related PGE is formed by direct crystallization of \n\nplatinum group minerals directly from the magma, in response to PGE saturation of the \n\nmagma.  \n\n \n\nKeywords: PGE; nickel; layered intrusion; magmatic sulfide; Caraj\u00e1s  \n\n \n\n \n\n3.1 \u2013 Introduction \n \n\n  Most of the platinum-group elements (PGE) deposits are hosted by a small \n\nnumber of layered intrusions (Cawthorn et al., 2005 and references therein). These \n\ndeposits can be generally subdivided into sulfide- and chromite-related, as exemplified \n\nby the well-studied world-class PGE deposits of the Merensky reef and UG2 chromitite, \n\nfrom the Bushveld Complex (e.g., Barnes and Maier, 2002; Cawthorn et al., 2002 and \n\n2005; Naldrett, 2004). The concentration of PGE global resources within just a few \n\nintrusions probably reflects the extremely efficient processes involved during the \n\nformation of PGE deposits (i.e., PGE enrichment in orders of 10\n5\n; Mungal and Naldrett, \n\n2008). The common processes that lead to PGE concentration within sulfide-related \n\n(Naldrett, 2004 and references therein; Mungal and Naldrett, 2008) and chromite-related \n\ndeposits (Finnigan et al., 2008) are considered sufficiently efficient. Anyways, the \n\ndiscussion about alternative processes that lead to PGE accumulation, apart from \n\nchromite- and/or sulfide-bearing rocks, and their implications for the exploration of \n\nthese elements is still open.  \n\n Apart from the processes that lead to PGE accumulation, the existence or not of \n\nPGE-fertile suites worldwide is still a debated issue. Some authors proposed that LIP \n\ncontaining Ni-Cu-PGE deposits are formed by magmas with distinctive geochemical \n\ncompositions (e.g., Maier and Groves, 2011; Griffin et al., 2013), while others indicate \n\nthat a systematic association of unusual magmas and magmatic deposits are not \n\nsupported by current data (e.g., Fiorentini et al., 2010; Barnes et al., 2015a). The \n\nLuanga Complex is part of a cluster of PGE-mineralized layered intrusions at the \n\neastern part of the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province (Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016). Hence, \n\na discussion about the existence, or not, of a PGE-fertile suite within this region is \n\nsupported by our results.  \n\n\n\n \n\n99 \n \n\n This study provides the first systematic geological and geochemical \n\ncharacterization of the PGE deposit of the Luanga Complex. Our results provide \n\nevidence for different styles of PGE mineralization (i.e., sulfide- and silicate-related \n\nPGE mineralization) within this layered intrusion. These results support a discussion \n\nabout efficient processes able to concentrate PGE, apart from the conventional sulfide- \n\nand/or chromite-related. Additionally, our data fits into the ongoing discussion of the \n\nexistence of PGE-fertile suites, especially within the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province.  \n\n \n\n3.2 - Regional Setting \n\n \n\n3.2.1 - The Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province  \n \n\n The Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province is located in the southeastern portion of the \n\nAmazonian Craton (Fig. 3.1A). It has become widely known due to several important \n\nmineral deposits, including several IOCG and Ni world-class deposits and the largest \n\niron resources of the world (Dardenne and Schobbenhaus, 2001; Klein and Ladeira, \n\n2002; Lobato et al., 2005; Xavier et al., 2010). The Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province also hosts \n\nthe world-class Au-Pd deposit of Serra Pelada (Meireles and Silva, 1988; Berni et al., \n\n2014). The province is subdivided in two Archean tectonic domains, separated by a \n\npoorly defined Transition Subdomain (Dall'Agnol et al., 2006; Feio et al., 2013). These \n\ndomains are defined as the Rio Maria Domain to the South and the Caraj\u00e1s Domain to \n\nthe north (Fig. 3.1B; Vasquez et al., 2008).  \n\nThe Rio Maria Domain is a typical granite\u2013greenstone terrain (Vasquez et al., \n\n2008). The Andorinhas Supergroup (Docegeo, 1988) comprises several individual \n\nMesoarchean greenstone belts (2,904 \u00b1 29 Ma; Macambira and Lancelot, 1996) and \n\nmetasedimentary rocks (Huhn et al., 1986; Souza and Dall'Agnol, 1996; Souza et al, \n\n2001). The recent characterization of spinifex-textured komatiites in a greenstone belt \n\nsequence within the Transition Subdomain (Siepierski and Ferreira Filho, 2016), \n\nsuggests that the Andorinhas Supergroup extends further north than indicated in \n\nprevious regional maps. \n\n\n\n \n\n100 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.  3.1: Geological setting. A) Location of the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province. AM - Amazonic Craton; B \u2013 \n\nBorborema Province; M \u2013 Mantiqueira Province; SF \u2013 S\u00e3o Francisco Craton; T \u2013 Tocantins Province. \n\nB) Geological map of the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province (modified from Vasquez et al., 2008). The dashed \n\nrectangle indicates the location of the Serra Leste magmatic suite. \n\n\n\n \n\n101 \n \n\nThe basement of the Caraj\u00e1s Domain consists mainly of gneiss-migmatite-\n\ngranulite terrains, generally related to the Xingu Complex (Docegeo, 1988; Machado et \n\nal., 1991; Pidgeon et al., 2000). This Domain comprises Archean volcano-sedimentary \n\nsequences, which includes the large sequence of metabasalts of the Gr\u00e3o Par\u00e1 Group \n\n(ca. 2.75 Ga; Machado et al., 1991; Vasquez et al., 2008) and several mafic-ultramafic \n\nlayered intrusions (Docegeo, 1988; Ferreira Filho et al., 2007; Teixeira et al., 2015). \n\nDifferent models have been proposed to explain the origin of these rocks, such as an \n\nintra-plate rift model (Gibbs et al., 1986; Villas and Santos, 2001) and also the evolution \n\nof a subduction-related environment (Dardenne et al., 1988; Teixeira and Eggler, 1994). \n\nThese volcano-sedimentary sequences are covered by clastic sedimentary rocks from \n\nthe \u00c1guas Claras Formation (i.e., Rio Fresco Group; Docegeo, 1988; Ara\u00fajo et al., \n\n1988; Nogueira et al., 1994 and 2000). \n\n \n\n3.2.2 - Mafic-ultramafic intrusions and associated mineral deposits of the Caraj\u00e1s \n\nMineral Province  \n \n\nSeveral mafic-ultramafic layered complexes intrude rocks of the Xingu Complex \n\nand Archean volcano-sedimentary sequences (Docegeo, 1988; Ferreira Filho et al., \n\n2007). These intrusions include, among many others, the Serra da On\u00e7a and Serra do \n\nPuma Complexes (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007; Rosa, 2014) that host large Ni laterite \n\ndeposits in the western portion of the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province, and the Vermelho \n\nComplex (Siepierski, 2016) that also host Ni laterite deposit in the Canaan dos Caraj\u00e1s \n\nregion (Fig. 3.1). The PGE-mineralized layered intrusions of the eastern portion of the \n\nCaraj\u00e1s Mineral Province, at the Parauapebas region, include the Luanga and Lago \n\nGrande Complexes (Fig. 3.1; Ferreira Filho et al., 2007; Teixeira et al., 2015; Mansur \n\nand Ferreira Filho, 2016). Layered intrusions in the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province show \n\nsignificant differences in magmatic structures and petrological evolution, thus \n\nsuggesting that they belong to different Neoarchean magmatic suites (e.g., Ferreira \n\nFilho et al., 2007; Rosa, 2014; Teixeira et al., 2015). \n\nThe Serra Leste Magmatic Suite (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007) consists of a cluster \n\nof small- to medium-size layered mafic-ultramafic intrusions located in the northeastern \n\nportion of the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province (Fig. 3.1). This suite was originally grouped \n\nbased on abundant PGE anomalies of the layered intrusions, disregarding any \n\ngeological, stratigraphic or petrological consideration (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007). \n\nRecent studies of the Lago Grande Complex (Teixeira et al., 2015) and Luanga \n\n\n\n \n\n102 \n \n\nComplex (Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016) are the first systematic stratigraphic and \n\npetrological investigations of layered intrusions ascribed to the Serra Leste suite, thus \n\nproviding data for the composition of their parental magmas and fractionation \n\nprocesses. The Luanga Complex, subject of this study, hosts the bulk of the PGE \n\nresources in the Serra Leste region. \n\n \n\n3.2.3 \u2013 Luanga Complex  \n \n\nThe Luanga Complex is a 6 km long and up to 3.5 km wide layered intrusion \n\n(Fig. 3.2A) consisting of, from base to top, ultramafic cumulates (Ultramafic Zone), an \n\nintercalation of ultramafic and mafic cumulates (Transition Zone) and mafic cumulates \n\n(Mafic Zone; Fig. 3.2B; Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016). Geological section defined \n\nby drilling indicate that the Ultramafic Zone overlies the Transition Zone, which \n\noverlies the Mafic Zone, suggesting thus that the layered sequence is tectonically \n\noverturned (Fig. 3.2B; Ferreira Filho et al., 2007; Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016). The \n\nUltramafic Zone comprises an up to 800 m-thick sequence of serpentinites (i.e., \n\nmetamorphosed peridotite) with few meters thick orthopyroxenite lenses at the upper \n\nportions. The Transition Zone consists of an up to 800 m pile of interlayered ultramafic \n\nand mafic cumulate rocks. Interlayering in the Transitin Zone consists of \n\northopyroxenite, harzburgite and norite in different scale and variable textures. The \n\nMafic Zone consists of an up to 2000 meters-thick monotonous sequence of noritic \n\nrocks and minor interlayered orthopyroxenite with subordinated chromitite (Mansur and \n\nFerreira Filho, 2016).  \n\n PGE mineralization occurs associated with base metal sulfides between the \n\nUltramafic and Transition Zones (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007) and associated with \n\nchromitite layers along the Transition Zone (Diella et al., 1995). A systematic \n\ndescription of different styles of PGE mineralization in the Luanga Complex is \n\npresented in this study.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n103 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3 \u2013 Exploration Review \n \n\nMafic-ultramafic rocks and chromitites of the Luanga Complex were identified \n\nin 1983 during regional exploration developed by DOCEGEO (now VALE S.A.) in the \n\nSerra Leste region. Following the discovery of up to 2-m thick chromitites, DOCEGEO \n\nFig. 3.2: Local geology. A) Geological map of the Luanga Complex (partially modified from \n\nunpublished report of VALE). Note the location of drill holes referred to in this study. B) Geological \n\nsection on the central portion of the layered complex. PGE mineralized intervals are indicated (partially \n\nmodified from Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016). \n\n\n\n \n\n104 \n \n\ncarried out geological mapping, soil geochemistry survey (400 m x 40 m grid) and \n\nground magnetometric survey in the Luanga Complex. Four diamond bore holes were \n\ndrilled to test the thickness and lateral continuity of outcropping chromitites. The \n\ndrilling was not positive for chromite mineralization, but intersected anomalous \n\nconcentrations of Pt and Pd, including 9 meters at 2.57 ppm of Pt+Pd (i.e., drill core \n\nLUFD-04). In 1997, a joint-venture DOCEGEO-Barrick Gold carried out a stream \n\nsediment campaign over the Luanga Complex area that identified Au anomalies (up to \n\n3,061 ppb). In 2000, Vale S.A., aiming to increase the Au resources of the Serra Leste \n\nAu Project (which included VALE\u2019s Serra Pelada deposit), carried out a new soil \n\ngeochemistry survey to test the Au anomalies indicated by Barrick Gold. The sampling \n\ngrid, covering the southern portion of Luanga Complex, indicated a 1 km long trend of \n\nPt and Pd anomalies. Due to his anomalous trend with up to 1,450 ppb of Pt+Pd, Vale \n\nS.A. carried out in 2000 additional soil geochemistry survey in the northern portion of \n\nthe Luanga Complex (next to chromitite layers). This sampling indicated another 1 km \n\nlong Pd and Pt anomalous trend with up to 804 ppb of Pt+Pd, The geochemical survey \n\nwas extended to the central portion of the layered complex and indicated a 2 km \n\nextension trend of Pt and Pd anomalies with up to 1,436 ppb of Pt+Pd, providing a \n\ncontinuous Pt-Pd-Cu anomalous trend along the entire layered intrusion. In 2001, Vale \n\nS.A. started an exploration program for PGE in the Serra Leste region. Systematic \n\ngeological and structural mapping using RADARSAT and TM5 integrated data, along \n\nwith airborne geophysical survey, led to the discovery of several layered intrusions \n\n(e.g.,  Formiga, Lago Grande, Luanga Norte, Pegasus, \u00d3rion, Afrodite). From 2001 to \n\n2007 Vale S.A performed 79,335 meters of diamond drilling and several ore technology \n\ncharacterization tests in layered intrusions of the Serra Leste region. The resource \n\ndrilling program in the Luanga Complex reached 45,174 meters of diamond drilling. \n\nThe systematic evaluation indicated that the Luanga Complex hosts a PGE deposit with \n\nresources of 142 Mt@ 1.24g/t PGE+Au and 0.11% Ni, for a given cut-off grade of 0.5 \n\ng/t PGE+Au. These resources were evaluated for a shallow (i.e., aproximatelly 250 \n\nmeters deep) open pit.  \n\n \n\n3.4 - Sampling and Analytical Procedures \n \n\nFor this study, drill holes from the central and northern portions of the Luanga \n\nComplex (Figs. 3.2A and 3.2B) were systematically sampled in order to select \n\nunweathered rocks. The sampling was supported by litogeochemical data of VALE\u2019s \n\n\n\n \n\n105 \n \n\nexploration database. Thin polished sections of the selected samples were studied in \n\ndetail at the microscopy laboratory at University of Bras\u00edlia. The analytical procedures \n\nare described as follows.  \n\n3.4.1 - Bulk Rock analyses \n \n\nFor litogeochemical analyses, two representative drill holes that intersect \n\ndifferent styles of mineralization (LUFD-224 and LUFD-226; Fig. 3.2B) were selected. \n\nSample preparation and lithogeochemical analyses were performed at ALS Chemex \n\n(Canada). Analytical procedures include the whole-rock package plus LOI (ALS \n\nChemex codes: ME-XRF06 and OA-GRA06), total S (ALS Chemex codes: S-IR08), \n\nPGE nickel sulfide collection plus Pt, Pd, Au 30g fire assay ICP (ALS Chemex codes: \n\nPGM-MS26 and PGM-ICP23) and the 48 elements four acid ICP-MS package (ALS \n\nChemex code: ME-MS61). A complete description of analytical methods is available in \n\nthe ALS Chemex Home Page (www.alsglobal.com). \n\n3.4.2 - Sm-Nd isotopes \n \n\n Sm-Nd isotopic analyses followed the method described by Gioia and Pimentel \n\n(2000) and were carried out at the Geochronology Laboratory of the University of \n\nBras\u00edlia (UnB). Whole-rock powders (~3000 mg) were mixed with \n149\n\nSm-\n150\n\nNd spike \n\nsolution and dissolved in Savillex bombs. Sm and Nd extraction of whole-rock samples \n\nfollowed conventional cation exchange techniques. The isotopic measurements were \n\ncarried out on a multi-collector Finnigan MAT 262 mass spectrometer in static mode. \n\nThe \n143\n\nNd/\n144\n\nNd ratios were normalized to \n146\n\nNd/\n144\n\nNd of 0.7219 and the decay constant \n\nused was 6.54 \u00d7 10-12\n-1\n\n. The TDM values were calculated using the model of DePaolo \n\n(1981). Nd procedure blanks were better than 100 pg. Sm-Nd results for 9 samples of \n\nthe Luanga Complex are shown in Table 3.1. \n\n3.4.3 \u2013 Sulfur isotopes \n \n\n Sulfur isotopic analyses were carried out at the Geochronology Laboratory of the \n\nUniversity of Bras\u00edlia (UnB) and followed an internal methodology. Approximately \n\n2000\u00b5g of sulfide grain powders were enclosed within tin capsules by the automatic \n\nsampler Thermo Scientific MAS 200R and introduced at the Thermo Scientific Flash \n\n2000 element analyzer. The sample is heated up to 1800\u00baC by an automatic addition of \n\noxygen and the combustion products are carried out by helium gas. The SO2 is \n\nseparated by a chromatographic column and then sent to the ion fount of the Thermo \n\nhttp://www.alsglobal.com/\n\n\n \n\n106 \n \n\nScientific MAT253 IRMS mass spectrometer. After the ionization and acceleration of \n\nthe sample, gas species with different masses are separated and analysed by faraday cup \n\ncollectors. The spectrometer is monitored and the obtained results are treated using the \n\nsoftware Isodat 3.0.  \n\n \n\n3.5 - Geology of the Transition Zone and PGE Mineralizations \n \n\nThe Transition Zone of the Luanga Complex (Figs. 3.2 and 3.3) hosts several \n\nPGE mineralized intervals (Fig. 3.2B). The following description of the Transition \n\nZone, based on Mansur and Ferreira Filho (2016), aims to provide the stratigraphic \n\nsetting of the mineralized intervals. \n\nThe Transition Zone, about 5 km long and up to 1 km wide, represents the \n\ncentral part of the Luanga Complex (Fig. 3.2A) and comprises a pile of interlayered \n\nultramafic and mafic cumulate rocks (Fig. 3.3). Interlayering of different rocks types \n\noccurs in different scales (from few centimeters to dozens of meters), and is a \n\ndistinctive feature of the Transition Zone. Cumulate rocks have variable textures, from \n\nadcumulate to orthocumulate, and variable assemblages of cumulus and intercumulus \n\nminerals, resulting in several different rocks types (Fig. 3.3). The most common rock \n\ntypes are orthopyroxenite (orthopyroxene adcumulate), harzburgite (olivine + chromite \n\ncumulate with either cumulus or intercumulus orthopyroxene), norite (orthopyroxene + \n\nplagioclase cumulate) and chromitite. The stratigraphic division presented in figure 3 is \n\nsimplified from a complex rock succession and illustrates the main cumulates from the \n\nTransition Zone. \n\n Orthopyroxenite (Figs. 3.3A and 3.3C) is a medium- to coarse-grained rock with \n\ntabular crystals of orthopyroxene as cumulus mineral. The texture varies from \n\nadcumulate to meso- and orthocumulate with plagioclase as the predominant \n\nintercumulus mineral (Fig. 3.3C). Harzburgite (Fig. 3.3C) is a medium- to coarse-\n\ngrained olivine + chromite cumulate with meso- to orthocumululate textures. The \n\ncontact between orthopyroxenite and harzburgite in the Transition Zone is commonly \n\nabrupt (Fig. 3.3C). Norite is a medium-grained orthopyroxene and plagioclase \n\nadcumulate rock (Fig. 3.3B). It occurs as discontinuous layers commonly following a \n\ngradational upward fractionation from orthopyroxenite, to plagioclase orthopyroxenite \n\nand norite.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n107 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSeveral chromitites occur at the top of the Transition Zone and at the lower part \n\nof the Mafic Zone (Diella et al., 1995; Ferreira Filho et al, 2007; Mansur and Ferreira \n\nFilho, 2016). These rocks consist of fine-grained euhedral cumulus chromite with \n\nvariable proportions of interstitial minerals (mainly extensively replaced plagioclase). A \n\nsystematic description of chromitites throughout the stratigraphy of the Luanga \n\nComplex is provided by Mansur and Ferreira Filho (submitted) and they are not \n\naddressed in this study.  \n\nFig. 3.3: Simplified stratigraphic column for the Luanga Complex. A) Representative core sample of \n\nthe Sulfide Zone. Medium-grained orthopyroxenite with interstitial base metal sulfides. B) \n\nRepresentative core sample of norite from the Transition Zone. Adcumulate textured norite consisting \n\nof orthopyroxene (dark brownish color) and plagioclase (white color). C) Core sample showing a sharp \n\ncontact of orthopyronenite and harzburgite. Orthopyroxenite consists of cumulus orthopyroxene with \n\nminor intercumulus plagioclase, while harzburgite consists of cumulus olivine with intercumulus \n\northopyroxene. Ol: olivine; Opx: orthopyroxene; Plg: Plagioclase.  \n\n\n\n \n\n108 \n \n\nApart from PGE mineralization hosted in chromitites (Diella et al., 1995; \n\nFerreira Filho et al., 2007), two distinct styles of PGE mineralization that occur in the \n\nLuanga Complex are detailed in this study: i) sulfide-related PGE mineralization and ii) \n\nsilicate-related PGE mineralization (Fig. 3.2B).  \n\n3.5.1 - Sulfide-related PGE  \n \n\nPGE mineralization associated with disseminated sulfides hosts the bulk of PGE \n\nresources of the Luanga Complex (i.e., 142 Mt at 1.24 ppm Pt+Pd+Au and 0.11% Ni; \n\nVALE internal reports). The stratigraphic section hosting the PGE deposit, referred to \n\nas the Sulfide Zone (Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016), consists of a 10 \u2013 50 m thick \n\ninterval with disseminated sulfides located along the contact of the Ultramafic and \n\nTransition Zones (Figs. 3.2B and 3.3A). The primary mineralogy of the hosting rocks is \n\ncommonly replaced by metamorphic assemblages. This metamorphic alteration is \n\nheterogeneous and characterized by an extensive hydration that largely preserves \n\nprimary textures (Fig. 3.3) and the compositional domains of igneous minerals (Ferreira \n\nFilho et al., 2007; Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016).  \n\nThe Sulfide Zone is a stratabound PGE mineralization consisting of interstitial \n\nsulfides (~ 1-3 vol. %) hosted by variably metamorphically altered orthopyroxenite \n\n(Fig. 3.3A) and peridotite (Fig. 3.4A). The location of the Sulfide Zone along the \n\ncontact zone is variable, such that sulfides may be hosted just by the lowermost \n\northopyroxenite of the Transition Zone, or encompass both the orthopyroxenite and the \n\nunderlying peridotite of the Ultramafic Zone (Fig. 3.3A). The mineralogy of the Sulfide \n\nZone does not show major variation through the deposit and consists of base metal \n\nsulfides with pentlandite > pyrrhotite > >> chalcopyrite (Fig. 3.4B). Magnetite is \n\ncommonly developed at the outer border or along fractures in sulfide blebs (Fig. 3.4C). \n\nBoth magnetite and rare pyrite crystals (Fig. 3.4D) occur in partially altered sulfide \n\naggregates.  Chalcopyrite is not abundant (&lt;10 vol% of the sulfides) and commonly \n\noccurs as fine-grained crystals at the borders of larger pentlandite and/or pyrrhotite \n\ncrystals (Fig. 3.4E). Additionally, thin lamellar chalcopyrite occurs enclosed within \n\npentlandite crystals (Fig. 3.4F). The metamorphic transformation of primary igneous \n\nsilicates of the hosting rocks (Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016) does not seem to \n\nsignificantly modify the sulfide mineralogy. \n\nThe occurrence of sulfide minerals is not restricted to the Sulfide Zone. Minor \n\nsulfide veinlets occur in thin (up to 8 m thick) discontinuous shear zones located along \n\n\n\n \n\n109 \n \n\nthe Luanga Complex. Sulfides in these zones have distinct texture and mineralogy \n\ndescribed for the Sulfide Zone, showing typically intergrowth with amphibole and \n\npredominantly composed by chalcopyrite. These occurrences are ascribed as \n\nhydrothermal sulfides.  \n\n3.5.2 - Silicate-related PGE \n \n\n The term silicate-related PGE is used in this study to indicate PGE-mineralized \n\nrocks devoid of base metal sulfides and/or chromite. The silicate-related PGE \n\nmineralization of the Luanga Complex consists of 2-10 m thick stratabound zones \n\nacross the Transion Zone.  These zones occur above the Sulfide Zone and do not show \n\nextensive lateral continuity (Fig. 3.2B). These silicate-related PGE zones commonly \n\noccur at the contact between layers of distinct cumulate rocks in the Transition Zone \n\n(Figs. 3.2B and 3.3C), but its occurrence within one rock type is also observed (e.g., \n\nnorite layer intersected by drill hole LUFD-077; Fig. 3.2B). The hosting rocks, mainly \n\nharzburgite and orthopyroxenite, do not show any distinctive texture or change in modal \n\ncomposition that characterize the PGE enrichment (Figs. 3.4G and 3.4H). In this way, \n\nthe PGE enriched intervals were not identified during core logging or routine \n\npetrographic studies. These PGE-anomalous intervals were just indicated by their \n\nanomalous Pt-Pd contents. A remarkable feature is the occurrence of anomalously Ni-\n\nrich olivines (up to 7400 ppm Ni; Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016) in harzburgites \n\nclosely associated with silicate-related PGE mineralization.  \n\n \n\n3.6 - Litogeochemistry of PGE Mineralizations \n \n\n  Two representative drill holes (LUFD-224 and LUFD-227; Fig. 3.2) were \n\ninvestigated in detail for a systematic characterization of different styles of PGE \n\nmineralization of the Luanga Complex. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n110 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 3.4: General aspects of the PGE-bearing rocks of the Luanga Complex.

C) Photomicrograph (reflected light) of typical intertitial base metal \n\nsulfides of the Sulfide Zone. Note that sulfides are partially replaced by magnetite with minor \n\nremobilization along fractures to host silicates. D) Photomicrograph (reflected light) of euhedral fine-\n\ngrained pyrite crystal enclosed within pyrrhotite grains.  \n\n\n\n \n\n111 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe plot of S vs PGE contents for unweathered samples with PGE contents \n\nhigher than 500 ppb and/or S contents higher than 0.05 wt.% is shown in Figure 3.5. \n\nThe correlation of these PGE-enriched (> 500 ppb) and/or sulfide-bearing (> 0.05 wt.%) \n\nindicates three geochemically distinct groups: i. sulfide-related PGE, ii. silicate-related \n\nPGE and iii. hydrothermal sulfides (Fig. 3.5). The sulfide-related PGE group comprises \n\nsamples with high PGE and S contents (i.e., up to 7000 ppb and 1 wt.%, respectively). \n\nThese samples correspond to orthopyroxenites and peridotites with interstitial base \n\nmetal sulfides from the Sulfide Zone (Fig. 3.3A). The silicate-related PGE group \n\ncomprises samples with high PGE (i.e., up to 2000 ppb) and very low S contents (&lt;0.1 \n\nwt.%). These samples correspond to orthopyroxenites and harzburgites from the \n\nTransition Zone (Fig. 3.3C). Finally, the group referred to as hydrothermal sulfides \n\ncorresponds to samples with high S contents (up to 0.7 wt.%) with low PGE contents (&lt;\n\n300 ppb. A description of these groups is provided as follows. \n\n3.6.1 - Sulfide-related PGE \n \n\n The groups referred to as sulfide-related PGE and hydrothermal sulfides include \n\nsamples with S content higher than 0.1 wt.% (Fig. 3.5). The analyses presented in this \n\nsection are core samples from drill hole LUFD-224 (Fig. 3.2A), which intersected the \n\nSulfide Zone of the Luanga Complex (Fig. 3.6).  \n\n The drill hole LUFD-224 intersects the contact between the Ultramafic and \n\nTransition Zones, and consequently the Sulfide Zone (Fig. 3.6). A sharp decrease in \n\nMgO and Al2O3 contents occurs in the transition, from olivine cumulates with \n\ninterstitial plagioclase below the Sulfide Zone to overlying orthopyroxene cumulates \n\n(Fig. 3.6). Two alteration zones located at the bottom of the drill hole LUFD-224 (i.e., \n\nthe uppermost portion of the stratigraphic column in Fig. 3.6) consists of partially to \n\nextensively sheared rocks.   \n\nFig. 3.4 (cont.): E) Photomicrograph (reflected light) of chalcopyrite crystals at the contact between \n\npyrrhotite and pentlandite. F) Photomicrograph (reflected light) of intergrowth between thin \n\nchalcopyrite lamellae and pentlandite. G) Typical core sample of harzburgite from the Transition Zone. \n\nThe harzburgite consists of cumulus olivine and intercumulus orthopyroxene and plagioclase. This rock \n\nshows high PGE contents (up to 2 ppm) and no sulfide is observed. H) Photomicrograph (crossed \n\npolarizers) of the harzburgite core sample shown in G. Note cumulus olivine crystals enclosed in \n\northopyroxene oikocryst. Cpy: Chalcopyrite; Mt: Magnetite; Ol: olivine; Opx: orthopyroxene; Pn: \n\nPentlandite; Plg: Plagioclase; Py: Pyrite; Po: Pyrrhotite. \n\n\n\n \n\n112 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThese altered intervals (~ 96-112 and 145-162 m in Fig. 3.6) have discrete zones with \n\nlower MgO and higher Al2O3 and S contents (Fig. 3.6) characterized by abundant \n\namphibole and sulfide veinlets. Except for the weathered rocks, Ni and S show a \n\npositive correlation throughout the drill hole LUFD-224, with high Ni contents (> 2500 \n\nppm) limited to the Sulfide Zone (Fig. 3.6). Pt and Pd show positive correlation with S \n\nand Ni, but high values are restricted to the Sufide Zone. Hence, samples from the \n\naltered intervals above the Sulfide Zone belong to the the hydrothermal sulfides group \n\nwhile samples from the Sulfide Zone belong to the sulfide-related PGE group (Fig. 3.5). \n\n Sulfide-bearing rocks from the Sulfide Zone contain 1-3% of base metal sulfides \n\nwith pentlandite > pyrrhotite > >> chalcopyrite (Fig. 3.4B). The modal proportion of \n\nbase metal sulfides in these rocks is consistent with their high Ni tenors (16-18 wt.%; \n\nFig. 3.7A), low Cu tenors (1.3-1.4 wt.%; Fig. 3.7C) and, consequently, high Ni/Cu \n\nratios (10-12; Fig. 3.7B). Samples with meaningful Au contents (i.e. up to 0.25ppm) are \n\nrestricted to the Sulfide Zone and the Au tenor is around 5 ppm. High PGE contents in \n\ndrill hole LUFD-224 are restricted to samples from the Sulfide Zone (Fig. 3.6).  These \n\nsamples have strong positive correlation between Pd and S, high Pd tenors (130-140 \n\nppm; Fig. 3.7E), and remarkably consistent Pt/Pd ratios (~ 0.55; Fig. 3.7D). Pt values \n\nsystematically lower than Pd is a characteristic feature of the Sulfide Zone, with Pt/Pd \n\nFig. 3.5: Plot of PGE versus S contents for samples with S and PGE values higher than 500 ppb and \n\n0.01 wt.%, respectively. The samples split into three groups: i. sulfide-related PGE, ii. silicate-related \n\nPGE and iii. PGE-depleted sulfides.  \n\n\n\n \n\n113 \n \n\nconsistently lower than 1 along the entire extension of the ore zone. Ru and S also show \n\na positive correlation and Ru tenor is around 2.5 ppm (Fig. 3.7G). These samples show \n\na strong positive correlation between Pd and Ru (Fig. 3.7F), and between Ru and Ir \n\n(Fig. 3.7H). The positive correlation between PPGE and IPGE is compatible to the \n\nsimultaneous segregation of these elements into the immiscible sulfide liquid during \n\nmagma crystallization. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Mantle-normalized patterns (Fig. 3.8) for samples from the Sulfide Zone show \n\nhigh to moderate PGE enrichment (10-1000 times) and minor to moderate Ni, Cu and \n\nCo enrichment (2-10 times). The PGE patterns are enriched in Pt, Pd and Rh (i.e., \n\nPlatinum Group Elements \u2013 PPGE) relative to Ir, Ru and Os (i.e., Iridium Group \n\nElements \u2013 IPGE). PGE patterns indicate a progressive increase from incompatible \n\nFig. 3.6: LUFD-224 drill core log and its MgO, Al2O3, Ni, Pt, Pd and S assay results and Cu/Pd ratios. \n\nThe thin dashed black line indicates the lower limit of the weathering profile, while the dashed gray line \n\nindicates the contact between the Transition and Mafic Zones.

The analyses presented \n\nin this section are core samples from drill hole LUFD-227 (Fig. 3.2A). \n\nThe drill hole LUFD-227 intersected the upper portion of the Transition Zone, \n\ncomprising mainly orthopyroxenite with minor interlayered harzburgite at the top (Fig. \n\n3.9). The weathering profile is indicated by progressively lower MgO and higher Al2O3 \n\ncontents (Fig. 3.9). The high PGE and S values observed at the top of the drill hole (i.e., \n\nthe lower portion of the stratigraphic column in Fig. 3.9), partially contained within the \n\nweathering profile, consist of samples of the Sulfide Zone at the northern portion of the \n\nLuanga Complex (Fig. 3.2A). Samples from the Sulfide Zone in drill hole LUFD-227 \n\nare variably weathered and were not considered in the following discussion, aimed to \n\ninvestigate a representative interval of silicate-related PGE mineralization. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 3.8: Primitive mantle-normalized chalcophile element profiles for representative samples from the \n\nSulfide Zone. Average komatiite and MORB values are from Crocket (2002). Primitive mantle \n\nnormalization values are from Sun and McDonough (1989). \n\n\n\n \n\n116 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nApart from the weathering profile, no significant variation is observed in MgO \n\nand Al2O3 contents throughout the monotonous sequence of orthopyroxene adcumulates \n\nin drill hole LUFD-227 (Fig. 3.9). High Ni values (~ 750-1000 ppm) through the \n\nstratigraphy are consistent with Ni contents of 800-1200 ppm in orthopyroxene in the \n\nlowermost portion of the Transition Zone reported by Mansur and Ferreira Filho (2016). \n\nThe reported values for Ni in orthopyroxene of the Transition Zone, together with very \n\nlow S contents in orthopyroxenite in drill hole LUFD-227 (&lt;0.1 wt.%), indicate that \n\nbulk rock Ni is mainly controlled by silicates. The distribution of Ni also indicates a \n\nconsistent upward decrease from ~ 1000 ppm above the weathering profile down to ~ \n\nFig. 3.9: LUFD-227 drill hole log and its MgO, Al2O3, Ni, Pt, Pd and S assay results.

Following an abrupt \n\nincrease to ~ 1000 ppm at the base of the PGE mineralized zone, Ni contents remain at \n\nvalues of ~ 1000 ppm in the upper portions of drill hole LUFD-227. High Pt and Pd \n\ncontents in the silicate-related PGE zone are not correlated with disseminated base \n\nmetal sulfides and S contents.

Different from the Sulfide Zone, Pt values are \n\nsystematically higher than Pd in the silicate-related PGE mineralized interval (Fig. 3.9), \n\nwith Pt/Pd ratios at 1.2-1.3 values across the entire zone (Fig. 3.10A). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMantle-normalized patterns (Fig. 3.10B) for samples from the silicate-related \n\nPGE zone show none to moderate PGE enrichment (1-100 times) and depleted Ni, Cu \n\nFig. 3.10: Geochemical analyses of samples from the silicate-related PGE mineralized horizon.

Both Nd and S isotopes are commonly used to \n\nevaluate the importance of the assimilation of crustal rocks during ascent and \n\nemplacement of mafic-ultramafic intrusions (Maier et al., 2000; Ripley and Li, 2007).  \n\n Sm-Nd isotopic data obtained for the Luanga Complex indicates positive ?Nd \n\n(T=2.76Ga) values, except for the slightly negative values of noritic rocks from the \n\nMafic Zone (Fig. 3.11). In terms of crustal assimilation, magmas that assimilated \n\nsignificant amounts of older sialic rocks are expected to show negative ?Nd values \n\n(Maier et al., 2000). Once the cumulates from the Transition and Ultramafic Zones \n\nshow variably positive ?Nd values (from 0.9 to 11.58), crustal assimilation of older \n\ncrustal rocks does not appear to be a significant process during the evolution of their \n\nparental magmas. Anyways, noritic rocks from the Mafic Zone show slightly negative \n\n?Nd values (-0.23 to -0.92), contrasting with the analysed norite sample from the \n\nTransition Zone (?Nd = 2.56). Noritic rocks from Transition and Mafic Zones of the \n\nLuanga Complex have very similar lithogeochemical features (Mansur and Ferreira \n\nTable 3.2: Sulfur isotopic data of Luanga Complex. \n\n\n\n \n\n120 \n \n\nFilho, 2016). The distribution of alteration-resistant trace elements of these mafic rocks, \n\ncharacterized by significant Nb and Ta anomalies and LREE enrichment, were \n\ninterpreted as the product of primitive magmas partially contaminated with older \n\ncontinental crust (Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016). This interpretation follows what \n\nhas been proposed for the magmatic evolution of the Lago Grande Complex (Teixeira et \n\nal., 2015). Mafic cumulate rocks from the Luanga and Lago Grande Complexes have \n\nvery similar distribution of alteration-resistant elements, but the latter has variably \n\nnegative ?Nd values (-0.32 to -4.25). Different Nd isotope compositions for the Lago \n\nGrande and Luanga Complexes, together with similar fractionation patterns and \n\nlithogeochemical compositions of their cumulates, may be interpreted as the result of \n\nsimilar primitive magmas variably contaminated with crustal rocks. This interpretation \n\nis consistent with the emplacement of 2.76 Ga layered intrusions within gneisses and \n\nmigmatites of the Xingu Complex (ca. 3.0 Ga). In this scenario the assimilation of \n\ncrustal rocks by the primitive magma would be significant for the parental magma of \n\nthe Lago Grande Complex but minor for the Luanga Complex.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 3.11: Variations of ?Nd values throughout the stratigraphy of the Luanga Complex. The ?Nd \n\nvalues are calculated for an age of 2.76Ga.  \n\n\n\n \n\n121 \n \n\nThe ?\n34\n\nS values of the mantle are traditionally considered to be 0\u00b12\u2030, but some \n\nstudies suggest a larger range around 0\u2030 (Seal, 2006). The ?\n34\n\nS values of the analysed \n\nsamples from the Sulfide Zone of the Luanga Complex fall in the range of 0 \u00b1 2\u2030, \n\nwhich suggests that the sulfur of these rocks is mantle-derived (Fig. 3.12). However, \n\nonce the country rocks of the Luanga Complex were not investigated, sulfur isotope \n\nresults do not provide unequivocal evidence for mantle-derived sulfur, considering that \n\ncountry rocks may also show mantle-like signature for sulfur isotopes. The ?\n34\n\nS value \n\nobtained from a sample of hydrothermal sulfide (i.e. 0.35) is similar to the values \n\nobtained for the Sulfide Zone. Hence, is reasonable to propose that these sulfides may \n\nbe originated by a hydrothermal remobilization of magmatic sulfides of the Sulfide \n\nZone. \n\nThe Nd isotopic data for the Ultramafic Zone and Transition Zone, which does \n\nnot suggest major assimilation of older crustal rocks, is thus compatible with a mantle-\n\nderived sulfur signature (Fig. 3.12). Both Nd and S isotope results suggest that sulfur \n\nsaturation that led to the formation of the Sulfide Zone in the Luanga Complex was not \n\ntriggered by the addition of external sulfur, as proposed in several studies of Ni-Cu-\n\nPGE deposits (Fig. 3.12; Ripley and Li, 2007).  \n\nThe assimilation of crustal rocks is commonly considered as a key factor for the \n\nformation of magmatic sulfide Ni-Cu-PGE deposits in mafic-ultramafic intrusions (e.g., \n\nRipley and Li, 2003; Barnes and Lightfoot, 2005). However, recent studies have also \n\nsuggested that magmatic deposits were originated from mantle-derived sulfur, as \n\nexemplified by the Nebo-Babel Ni\u2013Cu\u2013PGE deposit (Fig. 3.12; Seat et al. 2009), the \n\nPlatreef PGE\u2013Ni\u2013Cu deposit (Penniston-Dorland et al. 2008) and the Santa Rita deposit \n\n(Ferreira Filho et al., 2013). The evidence for another magmatic PGE deposit with \n\nmainly mantle-derived sulfur, provided in this study, reinforces the suggestion that an \n\nexternal source of sulfur is not essential for their genesis.  \n\n \n\n3.8.2 - PGE source \n \n\n The origin of magmas that lead to the generation of magmatic PGE deposits is \n\ncontroversial. Some authors propose the existence of igneous provinces where PGE-rich \n\nmagmas were formed (e.g., Maier and Groves, 2011; Griffin et al., 2013). This would \n\nexplain the spatial concentration of PGE deposits in a few locations worldwide. On the \n\nother hand, some authors argument that current data do not indicate the existence of \n\nPGE-rich igneous provinces (e.g., Fiorentini et al., 2010; Barnes et al., 2015a). These \n\n\n\n \n\n122 \n \n\nauthors propose that the generation of PGE deposits result from multiple enrichment \n\nfactors during evolution of magmas with low PGE contents commonly reported in \n\nprimitive magmas. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n The Luanga Complex is one of the layered intrusions ascribed as part of the \n\nSerra Leste suite (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007). This suite was originally grouped based \n\non PGE anomalies and spatial association of the mafic-ultramafic intrusions. Current \n\ndata, provided by recent studies (Teixeira et al., 2015; Mansur and Ferreira Filho, \n\n2016), support the existence of a PGE-fertile suite within the eastern portion of the \n\nCaraj\u00e1s Mineral Province. Whether this magmatic suite originated from anomalous \n\nFig. 3.12: Relation of the ?\n34\n\nS data for magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE deposits worldwide. The two black \n\ndashed lines indicate the mantle-deriver sulfur interval. References - Noril\u2019sk, Duluth, Voisey\u2019s \n\nBay, Jinchuan and Nebo-Babel: Seat et al. (2009) and references therein; Santa Rita: Lazarin \n\n(2011).  \n\n\n\n \n\n123 \n \n\nPGE-rich magmas or by the magmatic evolution of regular mafic magmas is the subject \n\nof current studies in the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province..  \n\n Systematic studies in Lago Grande (Teixeira et al., 2015) and Luanga (Mansur \n\nand Ferreira Filho, 2016) Complexes suggest that layered rocks in both intrusions \n\nfractionated from moderately primitive basaltic magma. Apart from similar rock types \n\nand PGE mineralizations, the magmatic evolution of these layered intrusions resulted in \n\ndistinct magmatic structure, stratigraphic sequence and Nd isotope composition. \n\nBecause the composition of the parental magmas of the Luanga and Lago Grande \n\nComplexes is not constrained by common features available in several layered \n\nintrusions (e.g., chilled margins, volcanic equivalents, feeder dykes), discussions \n\nregarding their PGE contents are not straightforward. An unusually PGE-rich parental \n\nmagma provides a convenient explanation for the abundance of PGE mineralizations in \n\nthe Serra Leste region, as well as different styles of PGE mineralization in individual \n\nintrusions. However, mafic-ultramafic magmas with abnormally enriched PGE contents \n\nare uncommon and PGE-mineralized layered intrusions are not usually considered to \n\noriginate from PGE-rich magmas.  \n\n In addition to magmatic PGE deposits hosted in layered intrusions, the Serra \n\nPelada Au-Pd hydrothermal deposit (Meireles and Silva, 1988; Berni et al., 2014) also \n\noccurs in the Serra Leste region. The Serra Pelada deposit Au-Pd mineralization is \n\nlocated 10 km northwest from the Luanga Complex (Fig. 3.1B). Berni et al. (2014) \n\npropose that the mineralizing fluids of this deposit become enriched in PGE by \n\ninteracting with mafic-ultramafic rocks of the Serra Leste suite. This assumption \n\ncontributes for the existence of a PGE-fertile underplate beneath the eastern portion of \n\nthe Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province. The existence of a PGE-fertile magmatic province would \n\nthus justify the spatial association of several PGE-mineralized layered intrusions and the \n\nunusually PGE-enriched Au deposit of Serra Pelada.  \n\n3.8.3 - Genetic model for the PGE-deposit  \n, \n\nOur results indicate that two highly different styles of magmatic PGE \n\nmineralization occur in the Luanga Complex. These are referred to as sulfide- and \n\nsilicate-related PGE mineralizations (Fig. 3.2B).  \n\nThe sulfide-related PGE, comprising the Sulfide Zone, consists of PGE \n\nassociated with interstitial base metal sulfides and resembles typical deposits originated \n\n\n\n \n\n124 \n \n\nfrom sulfide liquids segregated from mafic\u2013ultramafic magmas (e.g., Campbell et al., \n\n1983; Naldrett, 2004). The silicate-related PGE mineralization, on the other hand, \n\noccurs in rocks with no base metal sulfides. Host rocks of silicate-related PGE \n\nmineralization have no distinctive feature compared to adjacent unmineralized rocks. \n\nSulfide-related and silicate-related PGE mineralization have distinct mantle-normalized \n\nPGE profiles (Fig. 3.8 and 3.10A) and Pt/Pd ratios, typically 0.5-06 and 1.2-1.3, \n\nrespectively. The differences between both mineralization styles, together with its \n\ndifferent stratigraphic positions, suggest that they formed by distinct processes. Because \n\nthese different styles of PGE mineralization are closely associated to the Transition \n\nZone, a genetic model for their origin should be consistent with the magmatic evolution \n\nof this stratigraphic interval.  \n\nA simplified model for sulfide- and silicate related PGE mineralizations of the \n\nLuanga Complex is shown in figure 3.13. The crystallization of olivine cumulates in the \n\nUltramafic Zone without the crystallization of sulfide minerals progressively upgrades \n\nthe S content of the residual magma (stage 1; Fig. 3.13). The Transition Zone marks an \n\nabrupt change in the dynamics of the magmatic chamber, caused by several magma \n\ninputs characterized by cyclic units (Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016). Hence, these \n\nperiodic inputs of primitive magma are considered responsible to trigger the S \n\nsaturation of the magma and consequently the segregation of a sulfide liquid. Due to the \n\nhigh partition coefficients, PGE and base metals segregated into this sulfide liquid \n\n(Barnes and Lightfoot, 2005), which originates the Sulfide Zone between the Ultramafic \n\nZone and Transition Zone (stage 2; Fig. 3.13). Sulfur isotopes of the Sulfide Zone have \n\nmantle-like signature (Fig. 3.12), which means that sulfur saturation is not likely to be \n\nattained by new injections of crustal contaminated magmas.  \n\nThe silicate-related PGE mineralization occurs above the Sulfide Zone (Fig. \n\n3.2B). The Transition Zone originated from several magmatic pulses, such that the \n\ndepleted resident magma that followed the segregation of the Sulfide Zone may again \n\nbecome progressively enriched in PGE. Thus, if this magma does not reach the S \n\nsaturation again, the progressive PGE enrichment would not be accompanied by sulfide \n\nsegregation. We consider that the development of silicate-related PGE zones indicates \n\nPGE saturation in the magma leading to concomitant crystallization of silicates and \n\nPlatinum Group Minerals (stage 3; Fig. 3.13). The processes that led to PGE \n\naccumulation within these horizons are still poorly constrained. The investigation of \n\n\n\n \n\n125 \n \n\nplatinum group minerals (PGM) is currently being developed to investigate the minerals \n\ncontaining PGE. The accumulation of PGE apart from chromite- and/or sulfide-bearing \n\nrocks has been documented in other layered intrusion (Knight et al., 2011; Ferreira \n\nFilho et al., 2007). Models suggesting a direct crystallization of PGM from magma have \n\nalready been proposed (Hiemstra, 1979). Anyways, there is no clear agreement about \n\nthe processes that originate these chromite- and/or sulfide-free PGE-bearing rocks.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe occurrence of hydrothermal sulfides, with no PGE content and no magmatic \n\ncharacteristics, few meters above the Sulfide Zone (Fig. 3.6), is not genetically related \n\nwith the magmatic evolution of the complex. These sulfide-bearing rocks are probably \n\nformed by post-magmatic hydrothermal processes that remobilizes sulfide minerals but \n\napparently do not concentrate PGE (stage 4; Fig. 3.13). Anyways, it is not the aim of the \n\nFig. 3.13: Schematic model illustrating the formation of different styles of PGE mineralization \n\nthroughout the Luanga Complex. See text for explanation. UZ: Ultramafic Zone; TZ: Transition Zone; \n\nMZ: Mafic Zone. \n\n\n\n \n\n126 \n \n\npresent study to discuss the genetic model of these hydrothermal sulfide-bearing rocks, \n\nonce they do not appear to significantly disturb PGE-bearing rocks.  \n\nIn summary, the Sulfide Zone marks a moment of S saturation while the silicate-\n\nrelated PGE rich horizons mark the PGE saturation of the magma. The S saturation is \n\ntriggered by periodic primitive magma influxes at the contact of the Ultramafic Zone \n\nand the Transition Zone (Fig. 3.13). The formation of PGE-bearing rocks within \n\nstratigraphic horizons that marks dynamic moments in the evolution of a given \n\nmagmatic chamber is common and also documented in the Bushveld Complex (e.g., \n\nNaldrett, 2004). The processes that control the PGE accumulation in sulfide- and \n\nchromite-free horizons are still poorly constrained. \n\n3.8.4 - Sulfides with high Ni tenor and its implications  \n, \n\nPrevious studies, based on extremely high Ni contents in olivine (up to \n\n7500ppm) and orthopyroxene (up to 1600ppm), indicate an anomalously Ni-rich \n\nparental magma for the Luanga Complex (Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016). The \n\nauthors considered two possible explanations for the origin Ni-rich magma: i. a parental \n\nmagma derived from pyroxenitic mantle sources (Sobolev et al., 2007) or ii. Ni \n\nupgrading through dissolution of previously formed nickel-rich sulfide melts (Keer and \n\nLeitch, 2005). The model proposed by Keer and Leitch (2005) provides an explanation \n\nfor both the high nickel and PGE contents, as the dissolution of previously formed Ni-\n\nCu-PGE sulfides increases both Ni and PGE of resulting magma. Our results provide \n\nadditional data to contribute with this discussion and understand the relation between \n\nhigh Ni parental magma and PGE contents of the Luanga Complex.  \n\nThe study of chalcophile elements in sulfide bearing rocks of the Luanga \n\nComplex indicates a positive correlation between Ni and Cu with S (Fig. 3.7). \n\nAdditionally, these sulfides show remarkably high Ni tenors (up to 18 wt.%) with low \n\nCu tenors (up to 1.4 wt.%). These results are compatible with the sulfide assemblage of \n\npentlandite > pyrrhotite > >> chalcopyrite (Fig. 3.4B) and high Ni contents in olivine \n\nand orthopyroxene crystals from the Ultramafic and Transiton Zones (Mansur and \n\nFerreira Filho, 2016). A comparison between Ni, Cu and PGE tenors of different PGE \n\ndeposits worldwide is given in figure 3.14. The Sulfide Zone of the Luanga Complex \n\nstands out among other intrusions due to its high Ni and low Cu tenors, resulting in a \n\nvery low Ni/Cu ratio. In contrast, PGE tenors are not different, and eventually lower, \n\nwhen compared to other intrusions with much lower Ni/Cu ratios (Fig. 3.14).   \n\n\n\n \n\n127 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAdditionally, PGE mineralization is a remarkable characteristic of all the layered \n\nintrusions of the Serra Leste suite (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007; Teixeira et al., 2015), \n\nwhile high Ni olivine has so far been documented just in the Luanga Complex (Mansur \n\nand Ferreira Filho, 2016). Because systematic studies, including olivine analyses, in \n\nlayered intrusions of the Serra Leste region is so far restricted to the Lago Grande and \n\nLuanga Complexes, the model proposed for PGE mineralization of the Luanga \n\nComplex should be considered with discretion for other layered intrusions in the region. \n\n3.8.5 - Constrains for Ni and PGE exploration in the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province  \n \n\n The identification of anomalously high-Ni magmatism (Mansur and Ferreira \n\nFilho, 2016), as well as the characterization of different styles of PGE mineralization in \n\nLuanga Complex in this study, provided additional data to be considered during mineral \n\nexploration for magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE in the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province. Following the \n\nmodel developed by Kerr and Leitch (2005), Mansur and Ferreira Filho (2016) \n\ninterpreted these features as the result from the \"cannibalization\" of previously formed \n\nNi-PGE sulfides. This model, previously proposed to explain the origin of extremely \n\nNi-rich olivines associated with Ni-PGE orebodies in the Kevitsa intrusion in Finland \n\n(Yang et al., 2013), implies that the new inputs of Ni-rich fresh magma of the Transition \n\nFig. 3.14: Comparison of Ni, Cu and PGE tenors and Ni/Cu ratios of different PGE deposits \n\nworldwide. The data is obtained from Naldrett (2004) and references therein. LZ: Lower Zone; UZ: \n\nUpper Zone; MSZ: Main Sulfide Zone; SZ: Sulfide Zone.  \n\n\n\n \n\n128 \n \n\nZone have partially dissolved early formed sulfides. Exploration for magmatic Ni-Cu-\n\nPGE deposits in the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province indicated several PGE-mineralized \n\nlayered intrusions, but typical massive Ni-Cu-PGE deposits were not described in the \n\nregion. The indirect evidence that such deposits may have formed in the Caraj\u00e1s \n\nMineral Province is very positive for mineral exploration. Massive Ni-Cu-PGE deposits \n\nare commonly hosted in small conduit-type mafic-ultramafic intrusions (Barnes et al., \n\n2016), as exemplified by Nebo-Babel (Seat et al., 2009) and Limoeiro (Mota-e-Silva et \n\nal., 2013). Fingerprints of conduit-type Ni-Cu sulfide deposits are usually very small, \n\nrepresenting thus a challenge to exploration.  \n\n Another important feature to be considered during further exploration programs \n\nin the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province is the occurrence of non-traditional PGE-rich layers in \n\nthe Luanga Complex. PGE mineralizations that are not related to sulfide- and/or \n\nchromite-bearing rocks, characteristic of the silicate-related PGE ore described in this \n\nstudy, do not provide the usual associated geochemical anomalies (e.g., Cu and Cr) \n\nexpected in PGE deposits. Silicate-related PGE mineralizations are not restricted to the \n\nLuanga Complex and also occur in the Serra da On\u00e7a Complex (Macambira and \n\nFerreira Filho, 2005; Ferreira Filho et al., 2007) (Fig. 3.1B). These stratabound silicate-\n\nrelated PGE mineralizations are also not identified by any characteristic texture or \n\nmineralogical feature during drill core logging. These suggests that they may have been \n\noverlooked during previous exploration focused on traditional PGE deposits associated \n\nwith base metal sulfides or chromitites.  \n\nMafic-ultramafic intrusions in the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province have characteristics \n\nsuggesting a favorable potential to host magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE deposits. The most \n\nsignificant are listed as follows:  \n\ni. The Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province hosts several mafic-ultramafic intrusions \n\nwithin a Neoarchean cratonic terrain; \n\nii. Many layered intrusions have primitive parental magmas emplaced in \n\ndynamic magmatic system (e.g., Vermelho Complex; Luanga Complex); \n\niii. The cluster of PGE-mineralized intrusions in the Serra Leste region suggests \n\nthe existence of a PGE-fertile suite in the eastern portion of the Caraj\u00e1s \n\nMineral Province (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007; Teixeira et al., 2015); \n\niv. New inputs of Ni- and PGE-rich magmas in the Luanga Complex originated \n\nfrom the \"cannibalization\" of previously formed Ni-PGE sulfides; \n\n\n\n \n\n129 \n \n\n3.9 \u2013 Conclusions \n \n\n The main conclusions derived from the present study are listed below. \n\n? Apart from chromitites, two PGE mineralization styles occur in the Luanga \n\nComplex. These are referred to as sulfide-related PGE and silicate-related PGE. \n\n? The sulfide-related PGE comprises the Sulfide Zone, a 10-50 m thick \n\nstratabound zone of disseminated base metal sulfides (~ 1-3 vol.%) located \n\nalong the contact of the Ultramafic and Transition Zones. \n\n? The Sulfide Zone has high Ni tenors (16-18 wt.%) and Ni/Cu ratios (10-12), \n\ncompatible with the high modal percentage of pentlandite in the sulfide \n\nassemblage. PGE ore has Pt/Pd ratios lower than 1 (~ 0.55) and PPGE-enriched \n\nmantle-normalized patterns.  \n\n? The silicate-related PGE mineralization consists of 2-10 meters thick \n\nstratabound zones, located stratigraphically above the Sulfide Zone. These PGE-\n\nrich zones consist of cumulates (orthopyroxenite and harzburgite) with no \n\ndistinctive textural and mineralogical features compared to barren rocks.  \n\n? Silicate-related PGE is characterized by Pt values systematically higher than Pd \n\nwith Pt/Pd ratio around 1.2-1.3. Mantle-normalized patterns show high \n\nenrichment of Pt, Pd, Rh and Au without significant contents of Ir and Os.  \n\n? Nd isotopic data for cumulated from the Ultramafic Transition Zones show \n\npositive ?Nd (T=2.76Ga) values while cumulates from the Mafic Zone show \n\nslightly negative values. These positive values suggest that no extensive \n\ncontamination with older crustal rocks took place during the development of the \n\nLuanga Complex. \n\n? Sulfur isotopes show a narrow range of variation for ?\n34\n\nS values (between -\n\n1.69\u2030 and 0.35\u2030), which indicates that the sulfur of these rocks are possibly \n\nderived from mantelic source.  \n\n? Textural and geochemical differences between sulfide- and silicate-related PGE \n\nmineralizations support that they formed by different processes. While sulfide-\n\nrelated mineralization results of segregation of immiscible sulfide liquids, \n\nsilicate-related PGE mineralization formed possibly due to saturation of PGE in \n\nthe magma and co-precipitation of silicates and PGM. \n\n? The Sulfide Zone shows high Ni tenors and extremely high Ni/Cu ratios when \n\ncompared to other PGE deposits worldwide.  \n\n\n\n \n\n130 \n \n\n? Our results provide additional evidences for PGE-fertile magmatism in the \n\neastern portion of the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province (Serra Leste suite). \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements  \n\n \n\nThis study was supported by CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico \n\ne Teconol\u00f3gico) and VALE S.A.

Entretanto, uma vers\u00e3o sint\u00e9tica das \n\nconclus\u00f5es pode ser demostrada desta forma: \n\n \n\n1. Sobre a intrus\u00e3o: \n\n \n\ni. O Complexo Luanga \u00e9 uma intrus\u00e3o acamadada de m\u00e9dio porte, \n\nsubdividido em tr\u00eas por\u00e7\u00f5es principais. A evolu\u00e7\u00e3o do Complexo \u00e9 \n\ndin\u00e2mica, marcada pela sucessiva entrada de novos pulsos magm\u00e1ticos \n\nem um sistema magm\u00e1tico aberto.  \n\nii. Os conte\u00fados de Ni nas olivinas da Zona de Transi\u00e7\u00e3o do Complexo \n\nLuanga encontram-se entre os maiores valores registrados no mundo. A \n\nforma\u00e7\u00e3o de um magma an\u00f4malo em n\u00edquel pela dissolu\u00e7\u00e3o de sulfetos \n\npreviamente formados \u00e9 considerada adequada para explicar estes \n\nresultados.  \n\n \n\n2. Sobre a mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o  \n\n \n\ni. Dois estilos diferentes de mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o de EGP s\u00e3o observados no \n\nComplexo Luanga. Estes s\u00e3o indicados como Sulfide Zone e silicate-\n\nrelated PGE e possuem caracter\u00edsticas distintas. \n\nii. A Sulfide Zone \u00e9 um horizonte de 10-50 metros de espessura, localizado \n\nna passagem entre as Zonas Ultram\u00e1fica e de Transi\u00e7\u00e3o, com uma \n\ndissemina\u00e7\u00e3o de sulfetos (i.e. 3% vol.). A silicate-related PGE \u00e9 \n\nrepresentada por horizontes de 2-10 metros de espessura, \n\nestratigraficamente acima da Sulfide Zone, que apresentam concentra\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nan\u00f4malas de EGP e nenhuma associa\u00e7\u00e3o com sulfetos e/ou cromita.  \n\niii. Diferen\u00e7as texturais e geoqu\u00edmicas entre os dois estilos de mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nindicam que estes se formaram por processos geol\u00f3gicos distintos. A \n\nSulfide Zone \u00e9 formada pela segrega\u00e7\u00e3o de um l\u00edquido imisc\u00edvel de \n\nsulfeto, ao passo que a silicate-related PGE \u00e9 gerada pela satura\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\nmagma em EGP. \n\n\n\n \n\n139 \n \n\niv. Is\u00f3topos de S indicam uma fonte mant\u00e9lica para os sulfetos da Sulfide \n\nZone, de forma que n\u00e3o \u00e9 necess\u00e1ria uma fonte externa de enxofre para \n\nque o magma atinja a satura\u00e7\u00e3o nesse elemento.  \n\n \n\n3. Sobre os cromititos \n \n\ni. Cromititos estratiformes, com textura variada e espessura de at\u00e9 60 \n\ncent\u00edmetros, ocorrem ao longo do Complexo Luanga, hospedados no \n\ntopo da Zona de Transi\u00e7\u00e3o e base da Zona M\u00e1fica.  \n\nii. Em fun\u00e7\u00e3o do extensivo processo de metamorfismo que afeta as rochas \n\ndo Complexo Luanga, as composi\u00e7\u00f5es dos cristais de cromita s\u00e3o \n\nmodificadas. A altera\u00e7\u00e3o da composi\u00e7\u00e3o prim\u00e1ria \u00e9 marcada em cristais \n\nzonados, com  Mg# (Mg/Mg+Fe\n2+\n\n) progressivamente menor do n\u00facleo \n\npara a borda.  \n\niii. Altera\u00e7\u00f5es da composi\u00e7\u00e3o prim\u00e1ria de cristais de cromita comprometem \n\nsua aplicabilidade em estudos petrogen\u00e9ticos.  \n\n \n\n4. Sobre o magmatismo na Prov\u00edncia Mineral Caraj\u00e1s \n\n \n\ni. Os resultados apresentados suportam a exist\u00eancia de uma prov\u00edncia f\u00e9rtil \n\npara a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de dep\u00f3sitos de EGP na por\u00e7\u00e3o nordeste da Prov\u00edncia \n\nMineral de Caraj\u00e1s.  \n\nii. Os dados de Ni em olivina, bem como o tenor de Ni elevado indicam que \n\nmagmas an\u00f4malos em Ni foram gerados na Prov\u00edncia Mineral de \n\nCaraj\u00e1s."}]}}}
