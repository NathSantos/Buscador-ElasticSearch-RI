No \n\nprimeiro estudo, foi avaliada a resist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o atrav\u00e9s do m\u00e9todo push out e \n\na dureza Knoop do comp\u00f3sito dental Z250 (3M/ESPE) fotoativado utilizando o \n\naparelho de l\u00e2mpada hal\u00f3gena XL2500 (3M/ESPE) sob diferentes protocolos de \n\nfotoativa\u00e7\u00e3o: modo cont\u00ednuo (CH) (700 mW/cm2) por 20 segundos; modo cont\u00ednuo \n\nde baixa intensidade (CL) (150 mW/cm2) por 20 segundos; e, pulse-delay com \n\nativa\u00e7\u00e3o na intensidade de 150 mW/cm2 por 2s(P2), 3s(P3), 5s(P5), 10s(P10) ou \n\n15 segundos (P15), seguindo-se 1 minuto de espera, e complementado por 700 \n\nmW/cm2 por mais 20 segundos. Para o teste de push out, ap\u00f3s a fotoativa\u00e7\u00e3o, os \n\ncorpos-de-prova foram armazenados a 37\u00baC \u00b1 1 por 24h \u00b1 1 at\u00e9 serem \n\ndesgastados e polidos, e, os valores de resist\u00eancia \u00e0 uni\u00e3o foram observados \n\nnuma m\u00e1quina de ensaio universal (Instron) com c\u00e9lula de carga de 500 N e \n\nvelocidade de 0,5 mm/min. Para o ensaio de dureza, a fotoativa\u00e7\u00e3o seguiu o \n\nmesmo protocolo. Ap\u00f3s a confec\u00e7\u00e3o, as amostras foram embutidas em resina de \n\npoliestireno e submetidas ao acabamento e polimento com lixas d\u2019\u00e1gua, a fim de \n\nobter as medidas de dureza, na superf\u00edcie, a 1mm, 2, 3, 4, e 5 mm de \n\nprofundidade, num dur\u00f4metro (HMV 2, Shimadzu), utilizando carga de 50g, por 15 \n\nsegundos. Os dados foram submetidos \u00e0 An\u00e1lise de Vari\u00e2ncia e as m\u00e9dias ao \n\nteste de Tukey (5%). Os resultados de resist\u00eancia \u00e0 uni\u00e3o mostraram que o grupo \n\nP5,  apresentou valor de resist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o significantemente maior que os \n\ndemais grupos. O grupo CL apresentou resist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o menor que o grupo \n\nanteriormente citado, mas superior aos demais grupos. N\u00e3o houve diferen\u00e7a \n\nestat\u00edstica significativa entre os grupos P2, P3, P10, P15 e CH. A dureza Knoop \n\nmostrou que os grupos CH e P15 apresentaram as maiores m\u00e9dias de dureza na \n\nsuperf\u00edcie e at\u00e9 4 mm de profundidade. Os corpos-de-prova do grupo CL \n\napresentaram as menores m\u00e9dias de dureza. Na profundidade de 3 mm , a dureza \n\nKnoop de todos os grupos foi estatisticamente inferior a da superf\u00edcie. O segundo \n\nexperimento avaliou a resist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o atrav\u00e9s do m\u00e9todo de push out e a \n\ndureza Knoop do comp\u00f3sito odontol\u00f3gico Z250 (3M/ESPE), fotoativado com o \n\naparelho de l\u00e2mpada hal\u00f3gena XL2500 (3M/ESPE), utilizando diferentes \n\nprotocolos de fotoativa\u00e7\u00e3o: modo cont\u00ednuo (700 mW/cm2 por 20s) (CO); soft-start \n\n\n\n 2\n\n(50 mW/cm2 por 5s, seguido por 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS1); soft-start (100 \n\nmW/cm2 por 5s, seguido por 700 mW/cm2 por 15s) (SS2); soft-start (150 mW/cm2 \n\npor 5s, seguido por 700 mW/cm2 por 15s) (SS3); soft-start (200 mW/cm2 por 5s, \n\nseguido por 700 mW/cm2 por 15s) (SS4); soft-start (250 mW/cm2 por 5s, seguido \n\npor 700 mW/cm2 por 15s) (SS5); soft-start (300 mW/cm2 por 5s, seguido por 700 \n\nmW/cm2 por 15s) (SS6). Os testes de push out e de dureza Knoop foram \n\nrealizados como no primeiro experimento. Os dados foram submetidos \u00e0 An\u00e1lise \n\nde Vari\u00e2ncia e as m\u00e9dias ao teste de Tukey (5%). Os resultados mostraram que o \n\ngrupo SS3, obteve a maior resist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o quando comparado ao grupo CO. \n\nN\u00e3o houve diferen\u00e7a estat\u00edstica entre os outros modos soft-start em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos \n\ndemais grupos. Os outros resultados de dureza, n\u00e3o apresentaram diferen\u00e7a \n\nestat\u00edstica entre os grupos na regi\u00e3o de superf\u00edcie e at\u00e9 4  mm de profundidade. \n\nTamb\u00e9m foi observado que para cada grupo, n\u00e3o houve diferen\u00e7a estat\u00edstica entre \n\na regi\u00e3o de superf\u00edcie at\u00e9 a profundidade de 2 mm. O terceiro experimento avaliou \n\na resist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o atrav\u00e9s do m\u00e9todo de push out do comp\u00f3sito odontol\u00f3gico \n\nZ250 (3M/ESPE), fotoativado com o aparelho de l\u00e2mpada hal\u00f3gena XL2500 \n\n(3M/ESPE), utilizando diferentes protocolos de fotoativa\u00e7\u00e3o: soft-start (ativa\u00e7\u00e3o na \n\nintensidade de 150 mW/cm2 por 2s(SS2), 3s(SS3), 5s(SS5), 10s(SS10) ou 15 \n\nsegundos (SS15), e complementado por 700 mW/cm2 por mais 15 segundos); \n\npulse-delay (ativa\u00e7\u00e3o na intensidade de 150 mW/cm2 por 2s(P2), 3s(P3), 5s(P5), \n\n10s(P10) ou 15 segundos (P15), seguindo-se 1 minuto de espera, e \n\ncomplementado por 700 mW/cm2 por mais 15 segundos). Os testes de push out \n\nforam realizados como no primeiro experimento. Os dados foram submetidos \u00e0 \n\nAn\u00e1lise de Vari\u00e2ncia e as m\u00e9dias ao teste de Tukey (5%). Os resultados \n\nmostraram que n\u00e3o houve diferen\u00e7a estat\u00edstica entre os  modos soft-start. Para o \n\nmodo pulse-delay, o grupo P5 apresentou resist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o estatisticamente \n\nsuperior aos demais grupos.

The first \n\nstudy has assessed the bond resistance through the push out method and the \n\nKnoop hardness of the dental composite Z250 (3M/ESPE), photoactivated with the \n\nequipment of halogen light XL2500 (3M/ESPE), using different protocols of \n\nphotoactivation: the  continuous mode of high intensity (CH) (700mW/cm2) for 20 \n\nseconds; the continuos mode of low intensity (CL) (150mW/cm2) for 20 seconds; \n\nand the pulse-delay with 150mW/cm2 for 2s(P2), 3s(P3), 5s(P5), 10s(P10) or 15 \n\nseconds (P15), with a 1-minute delay, followed by 700mW/cm2 for 20 seconds. For \n\nthe push out test, the test specimens were stored at 370 C  \u00b1 1 for 24h \u00b1 1 until \n\nthey were ground and polished, and, the bond strength values were observed \n\nthrough a universal test machine (Instron) with a charge cell of 500N and the \n\nspeed of  0.5 mm/min. For the Knoop hardness, the specimens were made by \n\nusing the same photoactivation protocols. After, the specimens were embedded in \n\npolyestiren resin and sanded and polished in order to obtain the hardness \n\nmeasures on top, 1 mm, 2, 3, 4, and 5 mm deep in a hardness measure machine \n\n(HMV 2, Shimadzu), using a charge of 50g, for 15 seconds. The data were \n\nsubmitted to ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s test (5%).  The results of bond strength showed \n\nthat the P5 group presented significantly higher resistance values than the other \n\ngroups.The CL group presented a lower bond resistance than the group previously \n\nmentioned, though higher than the other groups. There was no statistic difference \n\nbetween the groups P2, P3, P10, P15 and CH. The results of Knoop hardness \n\nshowed that the groups CH and P15 presented higher values of Knoop hardness in \n\nsurfaces up to 4 mm deep. The specimens of the CL group presented the lowest \n\naverages of hardness. At 3 mm deep, the Knoop  hardness of all groups was \n\nstatistically inferior to the surface hardness. The second study evaluated the bond \n\nstrength through the push out method and the Knoop hardness of the dental \n\ncomposite Z250 (3M/ESPE), photoactivated with halogen lamp unit XL2500 \n\n(3M/ESPE), using different protocols of photoactivation: continuous mode \n\n(700mW/cm2 for 20s) (CO); soft-start (50 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 \n\n\n\n 4\n\nfor 15s) (SS1); soft-start (100 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) \n\n(SS2); soft-start (150 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS3); soft-\n\nstart (200 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS4); soft-start (250 \n\nmW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS5); soft-start (300 mW/cm2 for \n\n5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS6). For the push out test and Knoop \n\nhardness test the specimens were made how the first experiment. The data were \n\nsubmitted to ANOVA and Tukey test (5%). The results showed that the SS3 group \n\nobtained the higher bond strength when compared to the CO group. There were no \n\ndifferences among the other modes of soft-start in relation to the other groups. The \n\nother results in hardness, showed no statistic differences among the groups in the \n\nsurface region and up to 4 mm depth. It was also observed that within each group \n\nthere were no statistic differences between the surface region up to the 2 mm \n\ndepth. The third study evaluated the bond strength through the push out method of \n\nthe dental composite Z250 (3M/ESPE), photo activated with halogen lamp unit \n\nXL2500 (3M/ESPE), using different protocols of photo activation: soft-start (150 \n\nmW/cm2 for 2s(SS2), 3s(SS3), 5s(SS5), 10s(SS10) or 15 seconds (SS15), \n\nfollowed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15 seconds); pulse-delay (150 mW/cm2 for 2s(P2), \n\n3s(P3), 5s(P5), 10s(P10) or 15 seconds (P15), with a 1-minute delay, followed by \n\n700 mW/cm2 for 15 seconds). For the push out test the specimens were made how \n\nthe first experiment. The data were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey test (5%). The \n\nresults showed there were no statistic differences among groups photo activated \n\nusing soft-start mode. For pulse delay mode P5 obtained the highest bond \n\nstrength, statistically higher than other groups. The groups photoactivated with \n\npulse-delay mode showed bond strength statistically higher than soft-start mode.  \n\n \n\nKey words: curing units; composite; Knoop hardness; bond strength. \n\n \n\n\n\n 5\n\nINTRODU\u00c7\u00c3O GERAL \n \n\nNos anos 60, as resinas compostas come\u00e7aram a substituir gradativamente \n\nmateriais restauradores como a resina acr\u00edlica e cimento de silicato em \n\nrestaura\u00e7\u00f5es de dentes anteriores, por\u00e9m, com algumas limita\u00e7\u00f5es em suas \n\naplica\u00e7\u00f5es (Ferracane, 1992, Peutzfeldt, 1997) . Um dos principais obst\u00e1culos \n\nencontrados foi a infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o marginal, causada pela perda do selamento marginal \n\ndevido \u00e0 contra\u00e7\u00e3o existente durante o processo de polimeriza\u00e7\u00e3o (Rees &amp; \n\nJacobsen, 1989, Uno &amp; Shimokobe, 1994). \n\nDesde a introdu\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema de ativa\u00e7\u00e3o por luz vis\u00edvel para essas \n\nresinas, surgiram algumas vantagens como tempo de trabalho mais adequado, \n\nmaior resist\u00eancia \u00e0 compress\u00e3o e lisura superficial, entre outras. Por\u00e9m, \n\nindependente do comp\u00f3sito utilizado, ainda se verificava contra\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\npolimeriza\u00e7\u00e3o devido a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de liga\u00e7\u00f5es covalentes entre as mol\u00e9culas do \n\nmon\u00f4mero, contraindo a cadeia polim\u00e9rica (Peutzfeldt, 1997).  \n\nDentre os fatores que influenciam a contra\u00e7\u00e3o de polimeriza\u00e7\u00e3o desses \n\ncomp\u00f3sitos  pode-se citar: tamanho das mol\u00e9culas dos mon\u00f4meros,  quantidade \n\ndas part\u00edculas de carga,  grau de convers\u00e3o e  natureza do mon\u00f4mero (Walls et \n\nal., 1988). A contra\u00e7\u00e3o de polimeriza\u00e7\u00e3o pode formar fendas nas margens das \n\nrestaura\u00e7\u00f5es, devido \u00e0s tens\u00f5es geradas que rompem a uni\u00e3o entre comp\u00f3sito e \n\ndente, originando com isso infiltra\u00e7\u00f5es marginais e, conseq\u00fcentemente, irrita\u00e7\u00e3o \n\npulpar, sensibilidade p\u00f3s\u2013operat\u00f3ria, recidiva de c\u00e1rie e manchamento marginal \n\n(Uno &amp; Shimokobe, 1994). \n\nDentre as alternativas para se melhorar a integridade marginal das \n\nrestaura\u00e7\u00f5es com comp\u00f3sitos s\u00e3o citados: uso de materiais de base como resina \n\nflow e ion\u00f4mero de vidro que apresentam menor m\u00f3dulo de elasticidade que o \n\ncomp\u00f3sito para absorver parcialmente as tens\u00f5es geradas pela contra\u00e7\u00e3o; \n\nsistemas adesivos que contemplem efetivamente a uni\u00e3o com a estrutura dental; \n\nuso de t\u00e9cnica incremental e controle do escoamento do comp\u00f3sito durante a \n\nfotoativa\u00e7\u00e3o (Asmussen &amp; Peutzfeldt, 2001, Feilzer et al., 1995, Ikemi &amp; Nemoto, \n\n1994, Lutz et al., 1986, Venhoven et al., 1996, Versluis et al., 1998). \n\n\n\n 6\n\nEm rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao escoamento durante a fotoativa\u00e7\u00e3o, v\u00e1rias t\u00e9cnicas t\u00eam sido \n\npropostas com o objetivo de controlar a velocidade durante o processo de \n\npolimeriza\u00e7\u00e3o (Sakaguchi &amp; Berge, 1998, Uno &amp; Asmussen, 1991). Este controle  \n\npara reduzir a tens\u00e3o gerada pela contra\u00e7\u00e3o pode ser conseguido, atrav\u00e9s de uma \n\npolimeriza\u00e7\u00e3o inicial com intensidade de luz baixa seguida de polimeriza\u00e7\u00e3o final \n\ncom elevada intensidade, distanciando a ponta do aparelho fotopolimerizador da \n\nsuperf\u00edcie do comp\u00f3sito, ou, usando aparelhos emissores de luz com intensidade \n\nvari\u00e1vel (Feilzer et al., 1995, Koran &amp; Kurschner, 1998, Pires et al., 1993, \n\nUnterbrink &amp; Muessner, 1995). Assim, a menor taxa de convers\u00e3o inicial permite o \n\nescoamento do material, gerando menor tens\u00e3o interna decorrente da contra\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nposteriormente, a alta intensidade na polimeriza\u00e7\u00e3o promove adequado grau de \n\nconvers\u00e3o para obten\u00e7\u00e3o de propriedades f\u00edsicas e mec\u00e2nicas satisfat\u00f3rias \n\n(Davidson et al., 1984, Feilzer et al., 1995, Watts &amp; al Hindi, 1999).  \n\nComo esses fatores parecem contribuir para manuten\u00e7\u00e3o da uni\u00e3o do \n\ncomp\u00f3sito restaurador ao dente, este estudo prop\u00f5e avaliar o efeito de se propor \n\nv\u00e1rias alternativas de se modular a luz emitida pelo aparelho fotoativador durante \n\no processo de fotoativa\u00e7\u00e3o, na resist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o e tamb\u00e9m avaliar, de maneira \n\nindireta, o grau de convers\u00e3o do comp\u00f3sito atrav\u00e9s do ensaio de dureza Knoop.  \n\n\n\n 7\n\nPROPOSI\u00c7\u00c3O \n \n Este estudo tem como proposi\u00e7\u00e3o: \n \n\n1 \u2013 Avaliar a influ\u00eancia da varia\u00e7\u00e3o do tempo de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o inicial usando o \n\nm\u00e9todo de fotoativa\u00e7\u00e3o pulse-delay na resist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o (push-out) e dureza \n\nKnoop do comp\u00f3sito Z250. \n\n \n\n2 \u2013 Avaliar a irradi\u00e2ncia inicial ideal no m\u00e9todo de fotoativa\u00e7\u00e3o soft-start \n\npara promover maior resist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o verificada pelo teste (push-out) e dureza \n\nKnoop do comp\u00f3sito Z250. \n\n \n\n3 - Avaliar a influ\u00eancia da varia\u00e7\u00e3o do tempo de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o inicial usando os \n\nm\u00e9todos de fotoativa\u00e7\u00e3o pulse-delay e soft-start na resist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o (push-out) \n\ndo comp\u00f3sito Z250, e comparar os dois modos de fotoativa\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEste trabalho foi realizado no formato alternativo com base na delibera\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nda Comiss\u00e3o Central de P\u00f3s-Gradua\u00e7\u00e3o (CCPG) da Universidade Estadual de \n\nCampinas (UNICAMP) n\u00ba001/98. \n\n\n\n 8\n\nCAP\u00cdTULO 1 \n \n\nEffect of different modes of the light modulation on the bond \nstrength and Knoop hardness of dental composite \n\n(a ser enviado - formatado para o Journal of Dentistry) \n \n\nSummary \n \n\nObjective: This study verified the bond strength through the push-out method and \n\nthe Knoop hardness of the composite Z250, photoactivated with the curing unit \n\nXL2500 (3M/ESPE), using different photoactivation protocols: continuous mode - \n\nhigh intensity (CH) (700mW/cm2) for 20 s.; continuos mode - low intensity (CL) \n\n(150mW/cm2) for 20 s.; and pulse-delay with 150mW/cm2 for 2(P2), 3(P3), 5(P5), \n\n10(P10) or 15 seconds (P15), with a 1-minute delay, followed by 700mW/cm2 for \n\n20 seconds.  \n\nMethods: For push-out test (n=10), the bond strength values were obtained using a \n\nuniversal test machine (Instron) with a cross-head speed of 0.5mm/min.

There was no difference between the groups P2, P3, P10, \n\nP15 and CH. The results of Knoop hardness showed that the CH and P15 groups \n\npresented the highest values in surface up to 4mm deep. The specimens of the CL \n\ngroup presented the lowest mean. From 3mm deep, the means of all groups were \n\nstatistically inferior to the surface. \n\nConclusion: The initial time exposition for pulse-delay method can influence on the \n\nbond strength and Knoop hardness of Z250 composite resin. \n\n\n\n 9\n\n \n\nKeywords: dental composite, bond strength, Knoop hardness, pulse-delay. \nIntroduction \n\n \n\nResin composites are the direct restorative materials more used in dentistry \n1. Current dental composites are expected to have optical and mechanical \n\nproperties comparable to tooth enamel and dentin and provide a service life of 10 \n\nyears or more. However, the polymerization shrinkage still remains the primary \n\nproblem of dental composites. Shrinkage is inherent in current commercially \n\navailable system and will persist until non-shrinking or low-shrinkage polymers 2 or \n\nexpanding fillers are available in commercial composites. This creates contraction \n\nstress and marginal gap, leading to invasion of oral fluids and bacteria 3,4. \n\nHowever, several factors limit the performance of this material, especially depth of \n\ncure and degree of conversion. Light of an appropriate wavelength initiates photo-\n\npolymerization of methacrylate groups producing a highly cross-linked polymer \n\nmatrix. Light from the curing source must be able to adequately polymerize deeper \n\ncomposite regions than just the top, irradiated surface. However, as light passes \n\nthrough the composite, it is absorbed and scattered, reducing its effectiveness to \n\ninitiate polymerization, and consequently resulting in variation of cure with depth 5. \n\nAlthough high light intensity provides higher DC values, it also produces greater \n\npolymerization shrinkage, which may cause gap formation and further micro-\n\nleakage, compromising the longevity of the restoration 6-8. Another problem is that \n\nthe insufficient polymerization with high residual monomers may be released within \n\nthe first days in oral conditions 9,10. The unreacted monomers result in inferior \n\nphysical properties. Several methods of light modulation are used for the photo-\n\nactivation of the composites with the objective of minimizing the stress generated \n\nby the polymerization shrinkage. These photo-activation methods have been \n\nsuggested to initiate the composite cure reactions, maintaining DC values similar to \n\nthat found using high light intensity, whilst reducing the polymerization shrinkage. \n\nSoft-start polymerization and pulse-delay polymerization adopt an initially low light \n\nintensity followed by a final cure with high light intensity. A slower rate of \n\n\n\n 10\n\nconversion allows for better flow of the material, which in turn decreases \n\ncontraction stresses, leading to better marginal adaptation. The complement of \n\nphoto-activation with high irradiance is intended to allow the composite to achieve \n\nthe maximum degree of conversion 7,11,12. Irradiance diminishes as the curing tip is \n\nmoved away from resin composite restorative material 13, and can be used for two-\n\nsteps photo-activation methods. Furthermore, the viscoelastic nature of the \n\npolymerizing composite must also be considered. During polymerization, there is \n\nan irreversible increase in the elastic modulus of the composite. The moment that \n\nthe loss of the flowing capacity of the material occurs is called gel-point. Prior to \n\nthe gel-point, polymerization contraction will not create stress at the restoration \n\nmargins or within the material, as it is compensated by flow. However, rigid \n\ncontraction after the gel-point has received much attention and has been \n\nresponsible for the induction of stress in the bonding interface 14,15,16 demonstrated \n\nthat the speed of the polymerization reaction has a great effect in the generation of \n\nstress.  \n\nThe testing design for this study was a push-out model. Extrusion testing in \n\ndentistry was first described in 1970 by Roydhouse 17. He proposed pushing out \n\ndental material cylinders from tooth discs. Previous studies making use of a conical \n\nversion of the push-out design demonstrating the different bonding properties of \n\ndirect and indirect restorations with highly reproducible measurements 18. Besides \n\nthat, the cavity-like configuration of the bonding area allows the determination of \n\nboth composite bond strength and marginal adaptation on the same sample 18. \n\nIndependently of the photo-activation method applied, the DC must be as \n\nhigh as possible, ensuring that the material possesses the best properties. Studies \n\nin the literature demonstrating a good correlation between DC and hardness of \n\ncomposites and, hence, hardness is utilized as an indicator of DC 1,19,20.  \n\nThe ideal exposure time with low irradiance in the initial light exposition for \n\ntwo-steps polymerization methods is primordial to optimal marginal adaptation and \n\nmechanical properties of resin composites. The objective of this study was to \n\nevaluate the influence of initial light exposure time variations using pulse-delay \n\n\n\n 11\n\nphoto-activation methods on bond strength (push-out test) and Knoop hardness of \n\na resin composite. \n\n \nMaterials and Methods \n\n \n\nFor this study the composite resin Filtek Z250 (3M/ESPE, St.Paul, MN, \n\nUSA), shade A3, was used. \n\n \nPush-out test \n \n\nIt was used 70 round metallic matrices with 3mm height containing a \n\ntruncated-cone cavity with 6mm in the lower diameter and 9mm in the upper \n\ndiameter.  \n\nThese matrices were internally sandblasted with aluminum oxide 40 \u00b5m \n\nusing a micro-etcher (Danville Eng. Inc., USA). After sandblasting, the matrices \n\nwere etched with phosphoric acid 37% for 15 seconds, water rinsed and dried. The \n\nbonding agent silane (Ceramic Primer, 3M/ESPE) was applied and dried for 5 \n\nseconds. The adhesive system (Adper Single Bond, 3M/ESPE) was applied, air-\n\ndried for 20 seconds and photoactivated for 10 seconds using light-cured with \n\nhalogen lamp XL2500  (3M/ESPE).  \n\n  During the application of resin composite the matrices were set on a Mylar \n\nstrip positioned on a glass slab. The resin composite was bulk inserted and then \n\ncovered with a polyester strip and pressed with a microscope sheet to \n\naccommodate the material into the matrix and remove composite excesses. \n\nComposites were light-cured with halogen lamp XL2500 (3M/ESPE). The \n\nmaximum irradiance checked with the radiometer (Demetron Research Corp., \n\nDanbury, USA), was 700 mW/cm2. The specimens were photo-activated according \n\nto the following methods: continuous high irradiance mode (700 mW/cm2 for 20s) \n\n(CH); continuous low irradiance mode (150 mW/cm2 for 20s.) (CL); pulse-delay \n\n(150 mW/cm2 for 2s, delay of 1 min., followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 20s) (P2); pulse-\n\ndelay (150 mW/cm2 for 3s, delay of 1 min., followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 20s) (P3); \n\n\n\n 12\n\npulse-delay (150 mW/cm2 for 5s, delay of 1 min., followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 20s) \n\n(P5); pulse-delay (150 mW/cm2 for 10s, delay of 1 min., followed by 700 mW/cm2 \n\nfor 20s) (P10); pulse-delay (150 mW/cm2 for 15s, delay of 1 min., followed by 700 \n\nmW/cm2 for 20s) (P15). For reduced irradiances, the tip of curing units was moved \n\naway from composite surface. To standardize the photo-activation distance, \n\nspacers of acrylic resin (JET, Artigos Odontol\u00f3gicos Cl\u00e1ssico, S\u00e3o Paulo, SP, \n\nBrazil) were interposed between the surface of the composite and the tip of the \n\nlight curing units. \n\nAfter photo-activation, the specimens were stored in incubator at 37\u00baC \u00b1 1 \n\nfor 24h \u00b1 1, in a dark and dry container, before push-out test. The top and bottom \n\nsurfaces of restorations were grounded using 400 grit sandpapers (Carborundum, \n\nSaint-Gobain Abrasivos Ltda, PE, Brazil) on an automated polisher under water \n\ncooling to remove the composite excess, promoting a correct positioning of \n\nspecimen while testing.  \n\nFor push-out test an acrylic resin apparatus containing a central hole was \n\nattached in an universal testing machine (Instron model 4411, England). An \n\nsphere-shaped rod attached to a compression load cell (500N) was used to load \n\nthe composite restorations until failure at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. The \n\npush-out bond strength was determined by computing the quotient of maximum \n\nload (N) and adhesion area (equation for calculation of truncated cones; mm2). The \n\ndata were submitted to one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey\u2019s test at the 5% \n\nsignificance level.  \n\n \n\n Knoop hardness test \n \n\nFor the Knoop hardness test, one metallic mold (5 mm height X 5 mm \n\ndiameter) were used to obtain 70 specimens. The resin composite was bulk \n\ninserted. A polyester strip was seated on surface of the specimen and pressed \n\nmanually to remove composite excesses. Composites were light-cured with \n\nhalogen lamp, according to methods proposed to push-out test: continuous high \n\nirradiance mode (700 mW/cm2 for 20s) (CH); continuous low irradiance mode (150 \n\n\n\n 13\n\nmW/cm2 for 20s.) (CL); pulse-delay (150 mW/cm2 for 2s, delay of 1 min., followed \n\nby 700 mW/cm2 for 20s) (P2); pulse-delay (150 mW/cm2 for 3s, delay of 1 min., \n\nfollowed by 700 mW/cm2 for 20s) (P3); pulse-delay (150 mW/cm2 for 5s, delay of 1 \n\nmin., followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 20s) (P5); pulse-delay (150 mW/cm2 for 10s, \n\ndelay of 1 min., followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 20s) (P10); pulse-delay (150 mW/cm2 \n\nfor 15s, delay of 1 min., followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 20s) (P15).  \n\nAfter photo-activation, the specimens were stored in incubator at 37\u00baC \u00b1 1 \n\nfor 24h \u00b1 1, in a dark and dry container. Elapsed 24 hours, the specimens were \n\nembedded in polyestiren resin for grounding and polishing. After curing of \n\npolyestiren resin, the specimens were ground and polished using 320, 400, 600 \n\nand 1200 grit sandpapers (Carborundum) on an automated polisher under water-\n\ncooling. The specimens were dried and submitted to Knoop hardness \n\nmeasurements in a hardness tester (HMV 2, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) with load of \n\n50 g for 15 s. For each specimen, five readings were taken and an average was \n\ncalculated. \n\nThe data was submitted to two-way ANOVA (photo-activation mode x \n\ndepth), followed by Tukey\u2019s test at the 5% significance level.  \n\n \nResults \n \nPush-out bond strength \n \n\nTable 1 displays the means and standard deviations for bond strength \n\nresults. The P5 group revealed significant higher bond strength than other groups. \n\nSpecimens photo-activated using continuous mode with low irradiance (CL) \n\npresented bond strength statistically lower than group P5, but higher strength than \n\nother groups. The push-out test did not reveal statistical differences among P2, P3, \n\nP10, P15 and CH groups. \n\n \n\n\n\n 14\n\nKnoop hardness test \n \n\nTable 2 displays the means and standard deviations for Knoop hardness. \n\nFrom the top surface up to 4mm depths, groups CH and P15 presented the highest \n\nKnoop hardness means, which were statistically higher than groups P2 and CL \n\n(p<0.05). Specimens photo-activated using continuous mode with low irradiance \n\n(CL) presented the lowest Knoop hardness means (p<0.05). There were no \n\nstatistical differences among groups P3, P5, P10 and CH at any depth. Specimens \n\nof P2 presented Knoop hardness means statistically lower than group CH at top, 1, \n\n2, 3, and 4 mm depths. At 5 mm, composites of group CL presented too soft for \n\nKnoop hardness testing (mean 0.00). There were no statistical differences among \n\nother groups.  \n\nThe comparisons in the row (Table 2) show that at 2 mm depth the Knoop \n\nhardness of groups P2, P5, P10, and CL, was statistically lower than top surface. \n\nThe Knoop hardness for all groups at 3 mm depth was statistically lower than top \n\nsurface. \n\n \n\nDiscussion \n \n\nThe composite polymerization is a complex phenomenon that involves \n\ninnumerous factors. The magnitude of stress development depends on the volume \n\nfraction of fillers, filler geometry, ratio of modulus between polymer and particle, \n\nadhesion between polymer and particle, inherent shrinkage of the particle, and \n\ndegree of cure of polymer. The shrinkage stress is essential to longevity and \n\nsuccess composites, and depends on the polymerization rate, composition of \n\npolymeric matrix, specimen geometry, filler volume fraction, photo-initiators \n\nconcentration, and curing method. The rate of polymerization is influenced by \n\nphoto-initiators concentration, monomer reactivity, molecular weight of monomer, \n\nleading to different viscosities and mobility 21. Moreover, characteristics related to \n\nlight source, such as energy density and spectral flux, also alter final material \n\nproperties 5,22-26. Energy density is the product of irradiance and the duration of \n\n\n\n 15\n\nlight exposure 5,23,24, whilst spectral flux represents the optical power output from \n\nthe light-curing unit, in milliwatts, at each given wavelength 22,25. The DC in a \n\nphoto-activated composite is dependent on the total energy density, at the correct \n\nwavelength, supplied to the photo-initiator 27. Reduction of this initial speed can be \n\nobtained through the use of low intensity units that produce few free radicals 28. \n\nThis lower speed gives the composite more time for molecular rearrangement, \n\nreducing the stress caused by polymerization shrinkage 29. \n\n The pulse-delay method described by Kanca (1999) 30, uses the premise \n\nthat a short pulse of light followed by a relaxation period in dark, allows the relief of \n\nstresses prior to inducing additional stresses during the continuing polymerization \n31. In this work, pulse-delay using 5 seconds of initial exposure time produced bond \n\nstrength statistically higher as compared to other groups. Besides, the presence of \n\nthe highest bond strength means the Knoop hardness was similar to CH groups. In \n\nthose specimens induced less stress at bond interface, however the degree of \n\nconversion was maintained. According to Sakaguchi et al. 31, the maximum \n\ncontraction force rate occurs within the first 10 s of photo-activation. The \n\ncontraction force can lead to rupture in bond interface, promoting lower bond \n\nstrength. We observed that beyond irradiance, the exposure time has a great \n\nimportance for bond strength when the pulse-delay method was used. When short \n\nexposure time was used, P2 and P3 groups, showed that the bond strength was \n\nsimilar to CH group. Yap et al. 32, use the pulse-delay method in which the initial \n\nactivation was carried out for 3 s at an intensity of 100 mW/cm2, like in this study, \n\nand did not detect any shrinkage of the composite during photo-activation and the \n\nwaiting period. The authors believe that the energy density of the initial photo-\n\nactivation was not enough to effectively initiate a polymerization reaction and all \n\nthe shrinkage the composite underwent, was compensated for by the flow of the \n\nmaterial. The reaction only became effective when the second high irradiance \n\nexposure occurred. Thus, the reaction occurred under high intensity with a similar \n\nreaction speed to that of the CH. However, the Knoop hardness of P2 group was \n\naffected by short exposure time.  For longer initial exposure times, P10 and P15 \n\ngroups, bond strength were similar to CH group. The high energy density during \n\n\n\n 16\n\nthe first curing cycle for P10 (15.5 J/cm2) and P15 (16.25 J/cm2) produced high \n\nconversion of double bonds, leading to high shrinkage polymerization and \n\ncontraction force. This can be seen in the similar Knoop hardness results of P10, \n\nP15 and CH groups. When specimens were photo-activated using continuous low \n\nirradiance (CL), bond strength was statistically lower than P5, but higher than other \n\ngroups. The low irradiance during the photo-activation cycle, the polymerization \n\nreaction occurs slowly, allows the relief of shrinkage stresses, decreasing the \n\nstress in the bond interface. However, CL group presented the lowest Knoop \n\nhardness means. Those specimens were photo-activated using the lowest energy \n\ndensity (3 J/cm2). Regardless of light modulation method, it has been \n\nrecommended that energy densities similar to those supplied by conventional \n\nphoto-activation (continuous mode) are used. This is recommended because \n\nprevious studies related that the degree of conversion depends on energy density \n\nthat is supplied to the composite than photo-activation method 33,34. Koran and \n\nKurschner 12 found that the increase in density led to an increase in the hardness \n\nvalues until photo-activation with 17 J/cm2, after which there was no significant \n\nalteration in hardness values. In this study the maximum energy was given using \n\nP15 (16.25 J/cm2). Groups that presented the lowest energy density (P2 and CL) \n\nshowed Knoop hardness means statistically lower than CH. The bond strength of \n\nCL was statistically lower than P5. According to the results of this work, the \n\nrelaxation period in dark is of great importance for stress relief in composite.  \n\nThere were great differences between bond strength values. Push-out tests \n\nenable measurements of bond strength under more cavity-like conditions, \n\ndemonstrating the properties of the restorative system better than in the shear or \n\ntensile tests. Confined spaces are less favorable from a mechanical perspective as \n\na result of a high C-factor 35. Therefore, more stresses occur during polymerization \n\nthat pulls the bonded restoration away from the dentin walls, creating stress at the \n\ntooth-restorative interface 36. If shrinkage stress overcomes the bond strength, a \n\ngap may be formed at the tooth-restorative interface. It was observed that \n\nspecimens without gap formation presented high bond strength. However, when \n\ngap was present, there was a pronounced decrease in the bond strength. The \n\n\n\n 17\n\ngaps are sites of stress concentration. During the push-out test, the stresses are \n\nfocused in these sites, leading to rupture of bond. In those specimens without or \n\nless gap formation, the stresses are distributed for all bond interface, producing \n\nhigh bond strength values.  \n\n \nConclusion \n \n\nWithin the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that the initial light \n\nexposure time variations for pulse-delay photo-activation method influences on \n\nbond strength and Knoop hardness of the resin composite Z250. \n\n \n \nReferences \n \n\n1.

For the push-out test, the specimens were stored at 37\u00b0C \u00b1 1 for 24h \u00b1 1 \n\nuntil they are sanded and polished and the bond strength values were obtained \n\nthrough a universal testing machine (INSTRON) with a load cell of 500N and \n\nthe speed of 0.5 mm/min. The data was submitted to the variance analysis \n\nANOVA and the average to the Tukey test at a 5% significance level. For the \n\nKnoop hardness test the specimens were made using the same protocols of \n\nphoto activation. After that, they were embedded in polyestiren resin and \n\nafterwards sandblasted and polished in order to obtain the hardness \n\nmeasurements in hardness tester (HMV 2, Shimadzu), using a 50g load, for 15 \n\nseconds. For each specimen five readings were taken. The averages were \n\nsubmitted to the variance analysis and the averages to the Tukey test at a 5% \n\nsignificance level. The results of bond resistance showed that the SS3 group \n\nobtained the higher bond resistance when compared to the CO group. There \n\nwere no difference among the other modes of soft-start in relation to the other \n\ngroups. Regarding the other results in hardness, there have been no statistic \n\ndifferences among the groups in the surface region and up to 4 mm depth. It \n\n\n\n 25\n\nwas also observed that within each group there were no statistic difference \n\nbetween the surface region up to the 2 mm depth. \n\n \n\nKey words: dental composite, bond strength, Knoop hardness, soft-start. \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\n \nResin composites are the direct restorative materials most used in \n\ndentistry. Current dental composites are expected to have optical and \n\nmechanical properties comparable to tooth enamel and dentin and provide a \n\nservice life of 10 years or more. However, the polymerization shrinkage still \n\nremains the primary problem of dental composites. Regardless resin composite \n\nformulation, contraction polymerization occurs due to covalent bond between \n\nmonomer molecules, leading to polymeric chain shortening (1). Walls et al. (2) \n\nrelated that contraction polymerization is influenced by the molecular weight of \n\nmonomer, the filler content, the degree of conversion and the monomer \n\nformulation.  \n\nThis creates contraction stress, leading to marginal gap, invasion of oral \n\nfluids and bacteria, determining the composite longevity (1). However, several \n\nfactors limit the performance of this material, especially depth of cure and \n\ndegree of conversion (DC). Light of an appropriate wavelength initiates photo-\n\npolymerization of methacrylate groups producing a highly cross-linked polymer \n\nmatrix. Light from the curing source must be able to adequately polymerize \n\ndeeper composite regions than just the top, irradiated surface. However, as light \n\npasses through the composite, it is absorbed and scattered, reducing its \n\neffectiveness to initiate polymerization, and consequently resulting in variation \n\nof the cure with depth (3). Although high irradiance provides higher DC values, \n\n\n\n 26\n\nit also produces greater polymerization shrinkage, which may cause gap \n\nformation and further micro-leakage, compromising the longevity of the \n\nrestoration. Another problem is that the insufficient polymerization with high \n\nresidual monomers. The amount of residual monomers depends on the light \n\nsource and the photoatctivation method (4). This monomer may be released \n\nwithin the first days in oral conditions. The unreacted monomers result in inferior \n\nphysical properties, and can be leached of polymeric matrix (5). Marginal \n\nintegrity can be increased by absorbing stress materials under restorative \n\nmaterials; adhesive systems with high bond strength to tooth structure, \n\nincremental technique filling, and flowing control by light modulation during \n\nphoto-activation (6). \n\nSeveral methods of light modulation have been used for the photo-\n\nactivation of the composites with the objective of minimizing the stress \n\ngenerated by the polymerization shrinkage. These photo-activation methods \n\nhave been suggested to initiate the composite cure reactions, maintaining DC \n\nvalues similar to that found using high light intensity, whilst reducing the \n\npolymerization shrinkage (7). Soft-start polymerization adopts an initially low \n\nirradiance followed by a final cure with high irradiance. A slower rate of \n\nconversion allows for better flow of the material, which in turn decreases \n\ncontraction stresses, leading to better marginal adaptation. The complement of \n\nphoto-activation with high irradiance is used in order to make the composite \n\nachieve the maximum degree of conversion (6). Irradiance diminishes as the \n\ncuring tip is moved away from resin composite restorative material, and can be \n\nused for two-steps photo-activation methods. Furthermore, the viscoelastic \n\nnature of the polymerizing composite must also be considered. During \n\n\n\n 27\n\npolymerization there is an irreversible increase in the elastic modulus of the \n\ncomposite. The moment when the loss of the flowing capacity of the material \n\noccurs is called gel-point. Prior to the gel-point, polymerization contraction will \n\nnot create stress at the restoration margins or within the material, as it is \n\ncompensated by flow. However, rigid contraction after the gel-point has \n\nreceived much attention and has been responsible for the induction of stress in \n\nthe bonding interface (8). Kinomoto et al. (9) demonstrated that the speed of the \n\npolymerization reaction has a great effect in the generation of stress. The ideal \n\nphotoactivation method is primordial to optimal marginal adaptation, mechanical \n\nproperties and depth of cure of resin composites (10). By using a lower \n\nirradiance, free radicals formation will be lower than when a higher irradiance is \n\nused. A lower free radicals formation means that linear polymerization will \n\ninitially occur to a greater extent, thus the propagating chain comes close to an \n\nadjacent free radical or initiated chain as cross-linkage can occur. The aim of \n\nthis study was to evaluate the ideal initial irradiance using soft-start photo-\n\nactivation methods to produce the highest bond strength (push-out test) and \n\nKnoop hardness for a resin composite. \n\n \n\nMaterials and methods \n\n \n\nFor this study the composite resin Z250, shade A3 was used (3M, St. \n\nPaul, MN, USA)  \n\n \n\n\n\n 28\n\nPush-out test \n\n \n\nSeventy round metallic matrices with 3mm height containing a round \n\ncavity with 6mm in the lower diameter and 9mm in the upper diameter were \n\nused.  \n\nThese matrices were internally sandblasted with aluminum oxide 40 \u00b5m \n\nusing a micro-etcher (Danville Eng. Inc., USA). After sandblasting, the matrices \n\nwere etched with phosphoric acid 37% for 15 seconds, water rinsed and dried. \n\nThe bonding agent silane (Ceramic Primer) was applied and dried for 5 \n\nseconds. The adhesive system (Single Bond, 3M, St.Paul, MN, USA) was \n\napplied, air-dried for 20 seconds and photo-activated for 10 seconds.  \n\n  During the application of resin composite the matrices were set on a \n\nMylar strip positioned on a glass slab. The resin composite Z250 was bulk \n\ninserted and a Mylar strip was seated on the specimen surface and manually \n\npressed using a microscope sheet to remove composite excesses. \n\nComposites were light-cured with halogen lamp XL2500 (3M/ESPE, St \n\nPaul, MN, USA). The maximum irradiance checked with the radiometer \n\n(Demetron Research Corp., Danbury, USA), was 700 mW/cm2. Composite resin \n\nwere photo-activated according to the following methods: continuous mode (700 \n\nmW/cm2 for 20s) (CO); soft-start (50 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 \n\nfor 15s) (SS1); soft-start (100 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) \n\n(SS2); soft-start (150 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS3); \n\nsoft-start (200 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS4); soft-\n\nstart (250 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS5); soft-start \n\n(300 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS6). For reduced \n\n\n\n 29\n\nirradiances, the tip of curing units was moved away from composite surface. To \n\nstandardize the photo-activation distance, spacers of acrylic resin (JET, Artigos \n\nOdontol\u00f3gicos Cl\u00e1ssico, S\u00e3o Paulo, SP, Brazil) were interposed between the \n\nsurface of the composite and the tip of the light curing units. \n\nAfter light curing, the specimens were stored in an incubator at 37\u00baC \u00b1 1 \n\nfor 24h \u00b1 1, in a dark and dry container, before the push-out test. The top and \n\nbottom surfaces of restorations were ground using 400 grit sandpapers \n\n(Carborundum, Saint-Gobain Abrasivos Ltda, Cruz de Rebou\u00e7as/Igara\u00e7u, PE, \n\nBrazil) on an automated polisher under water cooling to remove the composite \n\nexcess, promoting the correct positioning of specimen while testing.  \n\nFor push-out test an acrylic resin apparatus containing a central hole was \n\nattached in an universal testing machine (Instron model 4411, England). A \n\nsphere-shaped rod attached to a compression load cell (500N) was used to \n\nload the composite restorations until failure at a crosshead speed of 0.5 \n\nmm/min. The push-out bond strength was determined by computing the \n\nquotient of maximum load (N) and adhesion area (equation for calculation of \n\ntruncated cones; mm2). The data was submitted to one-way ANOVA, followed \n\nby Tukey\u2019s test at the 5% significance level.  \n\n \n\n Knoop hardness test \n\n \n\n For the Knoop hardness test 70 specimens were made with a metallic \n\nmold (5 mm  height X 5 mm diameter). The resin composite was bulk inserted. \n\nA polyester strip was seated on surface of the specimen and pressed manually \n\nto remove composite excesses. Composites were light-cured with halogen \n\n\n\n 30\n\nlamp, according to the methods suggested for the push-out test: continuous \n\nmode (700 mW/cm2 for 20s) (CO); soft-start (50 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 \n\nmW/cm2 for 15s) (SS1); soft-start (100 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 \n\nfor 15s) (SS2); soft-start (150 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) \n\n(SS3); soft-start (200 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS4); \n\nsoft-start (250 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS5); soft-\n\nstart (300 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS6). For reduced \n\nirradiances, the tip of curing units was moved away from the composite surface. \n\nTo standardize the photo-activation distance, spacers of acrylic resin (JET, \n\nArtigos Odontol\u00f3gicos Cl\u00e1ssico, S\u00e3o Paulo, SP, Brazil) were interposed \n\nbetween the surface of the composite and the tip of the light curing units. \n\nAfter light curing, the specimens were stored in incubator at 37\u00baC \u00b1 1 for \n\n24h \u00b1 1, in a dark and dry container. Elapsed 24 hours, the specimens were \n\nembedded in polyestiren resin for grinding and polishing. After curing the \n\npolyestiren resin, the specimens were ground and polished using 320, 400, 600 \n\nand 1200 grit sandpapers (Carborundum, Saint-Gobain Abrasivos Ltda, Cruz de \n\nRebou\u00e7as/Igara\u00e7u, PE, Brazil) on an automated polisher under water cooling. \n\nThe specimens were dried and submitted to Knoop hardness measurements in \n\na hardness tester (HMV 2, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) with load of 50 g for 15 s. \n\nFor each specimen, five readings were taken and an average was calculated. \n\nThe data was submitted to two-way ANOVA (photo-activation mode x \n\ndepth), followed by Tukey\u2019s test at the 5% significance level.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 31\n\nResults \n\nPush-out bond strength \n\n \n\nTable 1 displays the means and standard deviations for bond strength \n\nresults. The SS3 group revealed significant higher bond strength than CO \n\ngroups. There were no statistical differences among different soft-start \n\nmethods. There were no statistical differences among groups SS2, SS4, SS5, \n\nSS6 and CO photo-activation methods.  \n\n \n\nKnoop hardness test \n\n \n\nTable 2 displays the means and standard deviations for Knoop \n\nhardness. There were no statically differences for Knoop hardness from top up \n\nto 4mm depth between soft-start method and control group. At 5mm, group \n\nSS4 presented the highest Knoop hardness means, which were statistically \n\nhigher than groups SS2 and SS3 (p<0.05).  \n\nThe comparisons in the row (Table 2) show that at 2 mm depth, the \n\nKnoop hardness of groups SS1, SS2, SS5, and SS6 was statistically lower than \n\ntop surface. The Knoop hardness for all groups at 3mm depth was statistically \n\nlower than top surface. \n\n \n\nDiscussion \n\n \n\n The testing design for this study was a push-out model. Extrusion testing \n\nin dentistry was first described by Roydhouse in 1970 (11). He proposed \n\n\n\n 32\n\npushing out dental material cylinders from tooth discs. Previous studies using a \n\nconical version of the push-out design demonstrated the different bonding \n\nproperties of direct and indirect restorations with highly reproducible \n\nmeasurements (12). Besides that, the cavity-like configuration of the bonding \n\narea allows the determination of both composite bond strength and marginal \n\nadaptation on the same sample (12). Independently of the photo-activation \n\nmethod applied, the DC must be as high as possible, ensuring that the material \n\nachieves the best properties. Studies in the literature demonstrate a good \n\ncorrelation between DC and hardness of composites and, hence, hardness is \n\nuseful as an indicator of DC (5). \n\nThe composite polymerization is a complex phenomenon that involves \n\ninnumerous factors. The magnitude of stress development depends on the \n\nvolume fraction of fillers, filler geometry, ratio of modulus between polymer and \n\nparticle, adhesion between polymer and particle, inherent shrinkage of the \n\nparticle, and degree of polymer cure. The shrinkage stress has great \n\nimportance to longevity and success composites, and depends on the \n\npolymerization rate, composition of polymeric matrix, specimen geometry, filler \n\nvolume fraction, photo-initiators concentration, and curing method. The rate of \n\npolymerization is influenced by the photo-initiators concentration, the monomer \n\nreactivity, the molecular weight of monomer, leading to different viscosities and \n\nmobility (13). Moreover, characteristics related to light curing unit, such as \n\nenergy density and spectral flux, also alter final material properties (3). Energy \n\ndensity is the product of irradiance and the duration of light exposure, whilst \n\nspectral flux represents the optical power output from the light-curing unit, in \n\nmilliwatts, at each given wavelength (14). The DC in a photo-activated \n\n\n\n 33\n\ncomposite is dependent on the total energy density, at the correct wavelength, \n\nsupplied to the photo-initiator. Reduction of this initial speed can be obtained \n\nthrough the use of low irradiance units that produce few free radicals (15). This \n\nlower speed gives the composite more time for molecular rearrangement, \n\nreducing the stress caused by polymerization shrinkage (16). \n\n The soft-start method described by Uno and Asmussen (17) uses the \n\npremise that a short pulse of light allows the relief of stresses prior to inducing \n\nadditional stresses during the continuing polymerization (18). In this work, the \n\namount of photons supplied to composite within the same exposure time was \n\nchanged. If the polymerization reaction depends on the generation of free \n\nradicals, the speed reaction would be changed for different irradiances during \n\nphoto-activation. The results showed the soft-start method using 150 mW/cm2 \n\ninitial irradiance (SS3) produced bond strength statistically higher than control \n\ngroup (CO). The low irradiance during the photo-activation cycle makes the \n\npolymerization reaction to proceed slowly, allowing the relief of shrinkage \n\nstresses and decreasing the stress at tooth-restorative material interface. \n\nBesides that, SS3 presented Knoop hardness means similar to CO groups \n\n(p>0.05). That means that, in those specimens, less stress occurred at bond \n\ninterface, whilst the degree of conversion was maintained. According to \n\nSakaguchi et al. (18), the maximum contraction force rate occurs within the first \n\n10 s of photo-activation. The contraction force can lead to rupture in bond \n\ninterface, promoting lower bond strength. The initial irradiance when soft-start \n\nmethod is used has a great importance for bond strength. When low irradiance \n\nwas used, SS1 and SS2 groups, bond strength was similar to CO group. We \n\nexpected that by using low irradiance in the photo-activation, the bond strength \n\n\n\n 34\n\nwould be increased. However, we believe that in those specimens the energy \n\ndensity of the initial photo-activation was not enough to effectively initiate the \n\npolymerization reaction. The reaction only became effective when the second \n\nhigh irradiance exposure occurred. Thus, the reaction occurred under high \n\nintensity similar to CO, leading to gap formation and lower bond strength (19). \n\nThis may be seen in the Knoop hardness test, in which SS1 and SS2 groups \n\npresented Knoop hardness means similar to CO.   \n\nThere were no statistical differences among SS4, SS5, SS6 and CO for \n\nbond strength. The speed reaction has been decreased to give the composite \n\nmore time for molecular rearrangement, reducing the stress caused by \n\npolymerization shrinkage (16). Maybe, the high energy density during the first \n\ncuring cycle for SS4, SS5, and SS6 produced high conversion of double bonds, \n\nleading to high shrinkage polymerization and contraction force. This can be \n\nseen in the similar bond strength results to CO. Regardless of the light \n\nmodulation method, it has been recommended that energy densities similar \n\nthose supplied by conventional photo-activation (continuous mode) be used. \n\nThis is recommended because previous studies reported that the degree of \n\nconversion depends on the energy density that is supplied to the composite and \n\nthe photo-activation method (20). Koran and Kurschner (7) found that the \n\nincrease in energy density led to an increase in the hardness values until photo-\n\nactivation with 17 J/cm2, after which there was no significant alteration in \n\nhardness values. However, the ideal energy density for photo-activation is \n\ncomposite dependent. In this study the energy density variations (10.95-14.00 \n\nJ/cm2) have no effect on DC, seen on Knoop hardness values.  \n\n\n\n 35\n\nConclusion \n\n \n\nWithin the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that the initial \n\nirradiance variations for the soft-start photo-activation method influences on \n\nbond strength, but do not have any effects on Knoop hardness values of the \n\nresin composite Z250. The best alternative for the traditional mode (continuous \n\nmode) is the soft-start mode with 150mW/cm2 initial pulse. \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\n1. Peutzfeldt, A.

The test specimens were stored at 370C \u00b1 1 \n\nfor 24h \u00b1 1 until they were ground and polished, and, the bond strength values \n\nwere observed through a universal test machine (Instron) with a charge cell of \n\n500N and the speed of 0.5 mm/min. The data were submitted to ANOVA and \n\nTukey test (5%). The results showed there were no statistic differences among \n\ngroups photo activated using soft-start mode. For pulse-delay mode, P5 get the \n\nhighest bond strength, statistically higher than other groups. The groups photo-\n\nactivated with pulse-delay mode showed bond strength statistically higher than \n\nsoft-start mode.  \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\nThe resin composites are the direct restorative materials most used in \n\ndentistry14. This is due to the possibility of bonding to dental structure, through \n\nadhesive systems, as well as its mechanical properties, that permit this material \n\nto be used both anterior and posterior restorations, and due to esthetic \n\ncharacteristics. However, composites present drawbacks like limited degree of \n\nconversion, due to the creation of a highly cross-linked network that limits the \n\nmobility of the reaction system 10. However, the primary problem of dental \n\ncomposites is still the polymerization shrinkage.  \n\n\n\n 41\n\nThe polymerization shrinkage depends on filler content, type of monomer \n\nused in resin matrix, i.e., monomer with high molecular weight present lower \n\ncontraction than monomer with low molecular weight1. Another alternative is the \n\nuse of non-shrinking or low-shrinkage monomers2. The polymerization \n\nshrinkage produces stresses. If these stresses are not relief internally, they can \n\nbe concentrated at the bonding interface and produce gap formation3. \n\nShrinkage stress at the bonding interface tends to destroy the bond between \n\nthe resin composite and the tooth structure5, 8. \n\nThe magnitude of shrinkage stress is decurrently of polymerization \n\nreaction speed7. The operator can minimize the shrinkage stress and gap \n\nformation at interface during photo activation using different photo activation \n\nmethods12 or incremental techniques18. To decrease speedy of polymerization \n\nreaction, and consequently the shrinkage stress, photo activation techniques \n\nthat suggest low irradiance during the initial period of photo activation were \n\nproposed7, 20. Soft-start polymerization technique adopts an initially low light \n\nintensity followed by a final cure with high light intensity. A slower rate of \n\nconversion allows for better flow of the material, which in turn decreases \n\ncontraction stresses, leading to better marginal adaptation19, 20. The \n\ncomplement of photo-activation with high irradiance is to composite achieves \n\nthe maximum degree of conversion5, 7, 20. In the pulse-delay photoactivation \n\ntechnique, there is a short time period (about 1-3 minutes) between initial \n\nexposition and final cure. This procedure can reduce the incidence of \n\ncavosurface marginal gap and enamel fracture6. Another advantage of this \n\nphotoactivation methods is that the degree of cure is similar to conventional \n\nmethod4, 13. \n\nHowever there are doubts as the best photo activation method and light \n\nexposure time to promote adequate bond strength between resin composite \n\nand dental structure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bond strength of \n\na resin composite photo activated using soft-start or pulse-delay technique, with \n\ndifferent initial light exposure time during the first photo activation cycle. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 42\n\nMaterials and Methods \n \n\nIt was used 100 round metallic molds with 3mm height containing a \n\nround cavity with 6mm in the lower diameter and 9mm in the upper diameter \n\n(Figure 1).  \n\nThese molds were internally sandblasted with aluminum oxide 40 \u00b5m using a \n\nmicro-etcher (Danville Eng. Inc., USA). After sandblasting, the molds were \n\netched with phosphoric acid 37% for 15 seconds, water rinsed and dried. The \n\nbonding agent silane (Ceramic Primer, 3M/Espe, St. Paul, MN, USA) was \n\napplied and dried for 5 seconds. The adhesive system (Single Bond, 3M/Espe, \n\nSt.Paul, MN, USA) was applied, air-dried for 20 seconds and photo-activated for \n\n10 seconds.  \n\n  During set, a Mylar strip was positioned on a glass slab. The resin \n\ncomposite Z250 (3M/Espe, St.Paul, MN, USA) shade A3, was bulk inserted and \n\na Mylar strip was seated on surface of the specimen and pressed manually \n\nusing a microscope sheet to remove composite excesses. \n\nComposites were light-cured with halogen lamp (XL2500, 3M/ESPE, St \n\nPaul, MN, USA). The maximum irradiance checked with the radiometer \n\n(Demetron Research Corp., Danbury, USA), was 700 mW/cm2. Resin \n\ncomposites were photo-activated according to follow methods: soft-start (150 \n\nmW/cm2 for 2s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS2); soft-start (150 mW/cm2 \n\nfor 3s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS3); soft-start (150 mW/cm2 for 5s, \n\nfollowed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS5); soft-start (150 mW/cm2 for 10s, \n\nfollowed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS10); soft-start (150 mW/cm2 for 15s, \n\nfollowed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS15); pulse-delay (150 mW/cm2 for 2s, \n\ndelay for 1 min, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (P2); pulse-delay (150 \n\nmW/cm2 for 3s, delay for 1 min, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (P3); pulse-\n\ndelay (150 mW/cm2 for 5s, delay for 1 min, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) \n\n(P5); pulse-delay (150 mW/cm2 for 10s, delay for 1 min, followed by 700 \n\nmW/cm2 for 15s) (P10); pulse-delay (150 mW/cm2 for 15s, delay for 1 min, \n\nfollowed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (P15). For reduced irradiances, the tip of \n\ncuring units was moved away from composite surface and to standardize the \n\nphotoactivation distance, spacers of acrylic resin (JET, Artigos Odontol\u00f3gicos \n\n\n\n 43\n\nCl\u00e1ssico, S\u00e3o Paulo, SP, Brazil) interposed between the surface of the \n\ncomposite and the tip of the light curing units. \n\nAfter light-curing, the specimens were stored in incubator at 37\u00baC \u00b1 1 for \n\n24 h \u00b1 1, in a dark and dry container, before push-out test. The top and botom \n\nsurfaces  of restorations were ground using 400 grit sandpapers (Carborundum, \n\nSaint-Gobain Abrasivos Ltda, Cruz de Rebou\u00e7as/Igara\u00e7u, PE, Brazil) on an \n\nautomated polisher under water cooling to remove the composite excess, \n\npromoting a correct positioning of specimen while testing.  \n\nFor push-out test an acrylic resin apparatus containing a central hole was \n\nattached in a universal testing machine (Instron model 4411, England). A sfere-\n\nshaped rod attached to a compression load cell (500N) was used to load the \n\ncomposite restorations until failure at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. The \n\npush-out bond strength (PBS) was determined by computing the quotient of \n\nmaximum load (N) and adhesion area (equation for calculation of truncated \n\ncones; mm2). The data were submitted to two-way ANOVA (photoactivation \n\nmode x exposure time), followed by Tukey\u2019s test at the 5% significance level.  \n\n \nResults \n\n \n\nThe Table 1 displays the means and standard deviations for bond \n\nstrength results. For pulse-delay photoactivation method group, P5 presented \n\nmean statistically higher than other groups. Group P2 presented the lowest \n\npush-out bond strength mean, statistically different of P5 and P10 groups. \n\nPush-out bond strength test didn\u00b4t show statistical differences among groups \n\nphotoactivated using soft-start methods. The comparisons between \n\nphotoactivation methods showed that P3 presented higher bond strength than \n\nSS3 (p<0.05); P5 presented higher bond strength than SS5 (p<0.05), and P10 \n\npresented higher bond strength than SS10 (p<0.05). There were no statistical \n\ndifferences neither specimens of group P2 and SS2, nor specimens of groups \n\nP15 and SS15 (p>0.05). \n\n \n\n\n\n 44\n\nDiscussion \n \n\nDuring photoactivation of the resin composites occur generation of free \n\nradicals that initiate polymerization reaction. The higher irradiance emitted from \n\nlight source, the higher free radicals generation and faster the speed of \n\npolymerization reaction10. To decrease speedy of polymerization reaction, and \n\nconsequently the shrinkage stress, photo activation techniques that commend \n\nlow irradiance during the initial period of photo activation were proposed6, 7, 20. In \n\nthis work, soft-start and pulse-delay technique of light modulation were used. \n\nThe results showed that pulse-delay produced higher bond strength than soft-\n\nstart, depending on initial light exposure time. Soft-start and pulse-delay \n\ntechniques adopt an initially low light intensity followed by a final cure with high \n\nirradiance. The difference between soft-start and pulse-delay is that for pulse-\n\ndelay, after the first polymerization cycle, there is a period in \u201cdark\u201d (1 minute) \n\nbefore the second polymerization cycle. Thus the composite has more time to \n\nmolecular rearrangement and stress relief. In this dark period still occurs \n\nspecimen conversion when samples are exposed to low irradiance. This is due \n\nto the free radicals that persist in the network after irradiation has ceased. The \n\nlower initial conversion produces greater mobility and allows more dark-cure \n\nand stress relief11. For soft-start technique the activation of some free radicals \n\nduring the first photo activation cycle occurs and initiates the polymerization \n\nreaction. Immediately after the first polymerization cycle the samples are photo \n\nactivated using the maximum irradiance emitted by light source. The high \n\nirradiance after the first cycle doesn\u2019t allow that the stress be relief internally16. \n\nThus the stress produced by fast polymerization reaction by second \n\npolymerization cycle added to stresses produced in the first cycle were directed \n\nto bond interface, leading to gap formation and reducing the bond strength as \n\ncompared to pulse-delay technique15.  \n\nWhen soft-start was used, the initial light exposure time had not influence \n\non the bond strength values. However, for pulse-delay technique intermediate \n\nlight exposure time during the first photo activation cycle produced bond \n\nstrength statistically higher than other groups. When the light exposure time is \n\nreduced, a little amount of free radicals and double bonds conversion are \n\nproduced9. Thus the great amount of reaction occurs in the second \n\n\n\n 45\n\npolymerization cycle, with a fast speed of polymerization. As the polymerization \n\nin the second cycle occurs at high speed, there is more shrinkage stress, \n\nleading to lower bond strength values17. \n\nThe groups that used longer initial light exposure times during the first \n\nphoto activation cycle (10 and 15s) also presented bond strength lower than \n\nintermediate group. When there is a longer light exposure time during the first \n\nphoto activation cycle, a great amount of polymerization reaction occurs. \n\nTherefore there is no time to stress relief and the shrinkage stress is \n\nconcentrate at bond interface, decrease the bond strength. \n\n \nConclusion \n\n \n\nWithin the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that the initial light \n\nexposure time variations for pulse-delay photo-activation method influences on \n\nbond strength of the resin composite Z250. However for soft-start the initial light \n\nexposure time variations had no influence. Pulse-delay presented bond strength \n\nstatistically higher than soft-start photo activation method.  \n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\n1. Asmussen E and Peutzfeldt A.

Durante a \n\ncontra\u00e7\u00e3o, tens\u00f5es provenientes da aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o das mol\u00e9culas dos \n\nmon\u00f4meros ocorrem e se n\u00e3o forem liberadas internamente, podem se \n\nconcentrar na interface dente-material restaurador, levando \u00e0 falha quando do \n\nprocedimento restaurador. Para minimizar este problema, surgiram t\u00e9cnicas de \n\nfotoativa\u00e7\u00e3o que visam modular a velocidade da rea\u00e7\u00e3o, possibilitando um \n\nescoamento do comp\u00f3sito durante os per\u00edodos iniciais da polimeriza\u00e7\u00e3o, \n\ndiminuindo a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de tens\u00f5es entre as mol\u00e9culas de pol\u00edmero na \n\ninterface. Dentre estas t\u00e9cnicas se destacam os modos soft-start e pulse-delay. \n\nEntretanto, n\u00e3o existe um protocolo para utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o destas t\u00e9cnicas, pois o \n\ntempo de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o e a irradi\u00e2ncia ideal para fotoativa\u00e7\u00e3o ainda n\u00e3o foram \n\nestabelecidos. Portanto, procurou-se neste estudo verificar a influ\u00eancia do \n\ntempo de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o e da irradi\u00e2ncia durante o primeiro ciclo de fotoativa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nutilizando os modos soft-start e pulse-delay. Para isto, utilizou-se o comp\u00f3sito \n\nZ250 submetido aos ensaios mec\u00e2nicos de resist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o (push-out) e \n\nde dureza Knoop.  \n\nO primeiro estudo mostrou que o tempo de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o inicial para o \n\nmodo pulse-delay teve influ\u00eancia significativa sobre a resist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o e \n\nsobre a dureza Knoop do comp\u00f3sito Z250. Durante o primeiro ciclo de foto-\n\nativa\u00e7\u00e3o pelo modo pulse-delay, o tempo de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o de 5s com 150 mW/cm2 \n\ninicial e 700 mW/cm2 de irradi\u00e2ncia final apresentou os maiores valores de \n\nresist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o, enquanto manteve os valores de dureza Knoop \n\nsemelhante ao grupo controle. Prolongando-se o tempo de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 luz, \n\nmais f\u00f3tons atingem o comp\u00f3sito, ativando maior quantidade de foto-\n\niniciadores, ocorrendo desta forma, maior grau de convers\u00e3o. Durante os \n\nper\u00edodos iniciais de fotoativa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 que ocorre a maior gera\u00e7\u00e3o de tens\u00e3o de \n\ncontra\u00e7\u00e3o. A fotoativa\u00e7\u00e3o com baixa irradi\u00e2ncia propicia maior escoamento das \n\ncadeias monom\u00e9ricas, diminuindo a gera\u00e7\u00e3o de tens\u00e3o na interface, \n\nproduzindo maiores valores de resist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o. O grupo fotoativado pelo \n\nmodo cont\u00ednuo com baixa irradi\u00e2ncia apresentou resist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o inferior \n\n\n\n 51\n\nao grupo foto-ativado pelo modo pulse-delay com tempo de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o de 5s, \n\nmas superior aos demais grupos. Entretanto, este grupo apresentou valores de \n\ndureza Knoop inferiores ao grupo controle. Portanto, os menores valores de \n\ndureza podem ser devidos ao menor grau de convers\u00e3o obtido pelo comp\u00f3sito \n\nquando fotoativado por este modo, inviabilizando sua utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o. Os demais \n\ngrupos n\u00e3o apresentaram valores de resist\u00eancia diferentes do grupo controle, o \n\nque mostra que n\u00e3o foram capazes de diminuir a tens\u00e3o de contra\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\nO segundo estudo mostrou que a irradi\u00e2ncia durante o primeiro ciclo de \n\nfoto-ativa\u00e7\u00e3o quando o modo soft-start \u00e9 utilizado tem influ\u00eancia nos valores de \n\nresist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o, mas n\u00e3o na dureza Knoop do comp\u00f3sito Z250 at\u00e9 4mm \n\nde profundidade. O grupo fotoativado com irradi\u00e2ncia de 150 mW/cm2 \n\napresentou m\u00e9dia de resist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o superior ao grupo controle (CO), mas \n\nsemelhante aos demais grupos. A irradi\u00e2ncia est\u00e1 relacionada com a \n\nvelocidade em que a rea\u00e7\u00e3o ocorre. Quanto maior for a irradi\u00e2ncia, maior ser\u00e1 \n\na velocidade de rea\u00e7\u00e3o, levando a maior concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de tens\u00f5es na interface. \n\nNos grupos fotoativados com baixa irradi\u00e2ncia pouca rea\u00e7\u00e3o deve ter ocorrido \n\nnos per\u00edodos iniciais de fotoativa\u00e7\u00e3o. Portanto, a maior parte da rea\u00e7\u00e3o pode \n\nter ocorrido durante o segundo ciclo de fotoativa\u00e7\u00e3o, que \u00e9 realizado com alta \n\nirradi\u00e2ncia, semelhante ao grupo controle. J\u00e1, para os grupos fotoativados com \n\nirradi\u00e2ncia maior que 150 mW/cm2, a maior parte da rea\u00e7\u00e3o deve ter ocorrido \n\ndurante o primeiro ciclo de fotoativa\u00e7\u00e3o, numa grande velocidade. Desta forma, \n\nn\u00e3o foi poss\u00edvel a libera\u00e7\u00e3o das tens\u00f5es internas, proporcionando valores de \n\nresist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o semelhante ao grupo controle. Entretanto, os valores de \n\ndureza Knoop foram semelhantes aos do grupo controle, mostrando que o grau \n\nde convers\u00e3o monom\u00e9rica foi semelhante para todos os grupos. \n\nO terceiro estudo mostrou que o tempo de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o para o modo pulse-\n\ndelay teve influ\u00eancia significativa sobre a resist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o do comp\u00f3sito \n\nZ250, mas n\u00e3o teve influ\u00eancia para o modo soft-start. Al\u00e9m disso, os \n\nesp\u00e9cimes fotoativados pelo modo pulse-delay mostraram resist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o \n\nsuperior comparados ao modo soft-start. Quando os esp\u00e9cimes s\u00e3o \n\nfotoativados pelo modo pulse-delay, logo ap\u00f3s o primeiro ciclo de fotoativa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ncom baixa irradi\u00e2ncia, existe um tempo de espera antes do segundo ciclo com \n\nalta irradi\u00e2ncia. Durante este tempo de espera ocorre o relaxamento das \n\ncadeias polim\u00e9ricas e a libera\u00e7\u00e3o das tens\u00f5es de contra\u00e7\u00e3o internamente no \n\n\n\n 52\n\ncomp\u00f3sito. J\u00e1 os esp\u00e9cimes fotoativados pelo modo soft-start, imediatamente \n\nap\u00f3s o primeiro ciclo de fotoativa\u00e7\u00e3o os esp\u00e9cimes s\u00e3o fotoativados com alta \n\nirradi\u00e2ncia. Deste modo n\u00e3o h\u00e1 tempo para a \u201cacomoda\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d das cadeias \n\npolim\u00e9ricas, e as tens\u00f5es s\u00e3o concentradas na interface dente-material \n\nrestaurador, diminuindo os valores de resist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o. Para o modo soft-\n\nstart o tempo de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o influenciou nos valores de resist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o, \n\nporque n\u00e3o h\u00e1 tempo para a \u201cacomoda\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d das cadeias polim\u00e9ricas, \n\ndiferentemente do modo pulse-delay. \n\nAssim, atrav\u00e9s dos resultados obtidos neste estudo, pode-se concluir \n\nque a modula\u00e7\u00e3o da luz emitida pelos aparelhos de l\u00e2mpada hal\u00f3gena de \n\nquartzo-tungst\u00eanio \u00e9 um m\u00e9todo simples e eficaz para o cl\u00ednico minimizar a \n\nforma\u00e7\u00e3o de tens\u00f5es durante a fotoativa\u00e7\u00e3o dos comp\u00f3sitos. A maneira como \n\nse faz essa modula\u00e7\u00e3o pode fornecer resultados superiores ou inferiores ao \n\nm\u00e9todo convencional. \n\n\n\n 53\n\nCONCLUS\u00c3O GERAL \n \n\nDentro das limita\u00e7\u00f5es deste estudo pode-se concluir que: \n\n \n\n1 - A varia\u00e7\u00e3o no tempo inicial de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o da luz para o m\u00e9todo de \n\nfotoativa\u00e7\u00e3o pulse-delay com aparelho de l\u00e2mpada hal\u00f3gena influenciou na \n\nresist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o e na dureza Knoop do comp\u00f3sito Z250.  \n\n2 \u2013 A melhor alternativa de tempo inicial de fotoativa\u00e7\u00e3o para essa \n\nt\u00e9cnica foi o de 5 segundos.  \n\n3 - A varia\u00e7\u00e3o no tempo inicial de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o da luz para o m\u00e9todo de \n\nfotoativa\u00e7\u00e3o soft-start com aparelho de l\u00e2mpada hal\u00f3gena n\u00e3o influenciou na \n\nresist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o do comp\u00f3sito Z250. \n\n4 \u2013 A varia\u00e7\u00e3o na irradi\u00e2ncia inicial para o m\u00e9todo de fotoativa\u00e7\u00e3o soft-\n\nstart influenciou na resist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o, entretanto n\u00e3o afetou os valores de \n\ndureza Knoop do comp\u00f3sito Z250. \n\n5 \u2013 A melhor irradi\u00e2ncia para o modo soft-start foi com pulso inicial de \n\n150 mW/cm2 e final de 700 mW/cm2. \n\n6 \u2013 O modo pulse-delay mostrou valores de resist\u00eancia de uni\u00e3o \n\nsuperiores comparados ao modo soft-start. \n\n\n\n 54\n\nREFER\u00caNCIAS* \n \n\n1.
