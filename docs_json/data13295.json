Nobre (2014) makes a review of the literature on the relation \n\nbetween climate and the Amazonian forest cover and describes the forest\u2019s importance to the \n\nhydrologic cycle of the south-central part of South America. According to the report, \u201c[f]or the \n\nmost deforested portion of the Amazon a progressive delay is already observed in the onset of \n\nthe wet season, which has a profound effect on the agricultural sector\u201d. \n\nIn Brazil, there are many efforts to reduce deforestation and most of them happen under the \n\nAction Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (Plano de \n\nPreven\u00e7\u00e3o e Controle do Desmatamento na Amaz\u00f4nia Legal, PPCDAm), a holistic plan that \n\nintegrates the actions of many government institutions. Some efforts, however, are not \n\ngovernment led as the PPCDAm. \n\nOne factor that has been seen as an important deforestation driver is the soybean expansion into \n\nthe Amazon Biome (Fearnside (2001), Casa Civil (2004), Watts (2005), Greenpeace (2006)). \n\nAfter Greenpeace organizing a protest at the port of one of the main soy exporters in the \n\nAmazon and releasing a report on the threats posed by the soy expansion into the forest, the \n\nindustry signed an agreement in response to the reputational threat it then faced. Under the Soy \n\nMoratorium, as it is known, the members of the two biggest buyers\u2019 associations in the Amazon \n\nBiome committed to not buy any soy produced in areas deforested after July 2006. Although it \n\nhas been seen as a successful initiative to reduce deforestation, many of its evaluations are \n\nflawed for not using a careful empirical methodology and, therefore, cannot distinguish between \n\nthe moratorium\u2019s and the PPCDAm\u2019s effects1. To address this problem, I estimate the effect of \n\nthe Soy moratorium on annual forest loss using a triple-difference identification strategy. \n\nThe literature points that conservation policies are highly dependent on location targeted \n\n(Andam et al. (2008); Pfaff et al. (2009)). Also, there is evidence that a market ban may be \n\neffective to stop the commercialization of the banned good (Schlenker and Villas-Boas (2009), \n\nLemieux and Clarke (2009)). This effectiveness, however, depend on the producers\u2019 capacity \n\nto escape the ban (Lemieux and Clarke (2009), Soares and Chimeli (2011)). Also, a market ban \n\n                                                             \n1 See the critique of Gibbs et al. (2015) in section 2. \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n \n\nmay as well as have unintended consequences, such as the increase of violence related to the \n\nnow illegal good (Soares and Chimeli (2011)). \n\nThe Soy Moratorium, unlike the previous studied bans, is an industry led initiative and the \n\nquestion is if it can be effective even without the coercive power of the State. The Fair Trade \n\nliterature, as presented by Nunn et al. (2014), hints that it can. What raises concern, however, \n\nis the fact that the firms enforcing the moratorium are the same potentially harmed by it, since \n\nit could result in higher soy prices. Another reason the agreement may fail is poor land tenure, \n\nas it makes difficult for proper accountability: if the monitoring can\u2019t correctly identify the \n\nowner of a non-complying soy plantation, then they won\u2019t fear being excluded from the market. \n\nMy empirical strategy uses the design of the Soy Moratorium monitoring to select treatment \n\nand control groups. The monitoring focus on lands inside the Amazon Biome and only on the \n\nstates of Mato Grosso, Rond\u00f4nia and Par\u00e1. It also restricts to counties inside those states with \n\nover 5,000 hectares in soy planted. Therefore, I use non-soy producing counties (those with less \n\nthan 5,000ha in soy planted) to control for soy producing ones (those with at least 5,000ha in \n\nsoy planted) hoping to net out any effect on deforestation caused by other factors occurring \n\ninside the Amazon Biome, such as the PPCDAm policies. Since this does not net out effects \n\ndue to factors differentially affecting producers and non-producers, I also use the Cerrado \n\nBiome to control for the Amazon Biome. \n\nFor each county in these groups I use georeferenced data for the Legal Amazon on soy planted \n\narea to sort them into soy producers and non-soy producers. I also use georeferenced data on \n\ndeforestation to calculate two different measures: deforestation rate, defined as the share of the \n\ncurrent deforestation increment on the previous year remaining forest and the normalized \n\ndeforestation, defined as the deviation in standard deviations from the time mean of each county \n\ndeforestation increment. I then use these measures in two different specifications: two double-\n\ndifferences and one triple-difference. One double-difference captures differential effects of the \n\nPPCDAm policies on each biome while the other captures differential effects on soy producing \n\nand non-producing counties. The triple-difference captures the causal effect of the Soy \n\nMoratorium on deforestation. \n\nSince soy production is mainly concentrated near the biomes\u2019 frontier, I also estimate those \n\nsame equations for three different samples. One includes all counties inside the Amazon Biome \n\nwhile the other two exclude non-producing counties inside the Amazon Biome more than \n\n100km and 10km away, respectively, from producers. \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\n \n\nMy identification assumption is that, on the absence of the agreement, the difference in the \n\ndeforestation measure between soy producing and non-soy producing counties inside the \n\nAmazon Biome would have followed the same trend as the difference in the deforestation \n\nmeasure between soy producing and non-soy producing counties on the Cerrado portion of the \n\nLegal Amazon. To test it, I test for pre-trends equality in all estimations. I do not reject the \n\ncommon pre-trends assumption for the sample of Amazon Biome\u2019s counties within 10km from \n\nsoy producers and, therefore, my results are drawn from it. I find evidence that the Soy \n\nMoratorium had no effect to reduce deforestation in soy producing counties relative to non-\n\nproducers. This result, however, is not robust: in the full sample, the pre-trends estimates\u2019 \n\nsignificance is sensitive to functional form. \n\nI interpret this finding as evidence that either the Soy Moratorium cannot curb deforestation at \n\nall or that PPCDAm policies are already doing everything the moratorium could have done and \n\nthe agreement cannot contribute any further. This may be due to lack of enforcement or because \n\nproducers are able to escape the moratorium by displacing less lucrative agricultural products \n\ninto native forests and then planting soy on the now vacant land. If, for example, the farmer \n\nproduces both soybeans and cattle, it could expand soy production into the pasturelands and \n\ndisplace the cattle to another area, which may need to be deforested prior to the displacement. \n\nThe remainder of this work is organized as follows: in Section 2, I describe the related literature; \n\nin Section 3, I provide the background on the deforestation in the Amazon at the time of the \n\nmoratorium\u2019s implementation and on the agreement itself; in Section 4, I describe the data used \n\nand the deforestation measures; in Section 5, I present my empirical strategy and tests for the \n\npre-trends assumption, also explaining how I use the moratorium\u2019s monitoring criteria to sort \n\ncounties into treatment and control groups; results are presented in Section 6 and discussed in \n\nSection 7; Section 8 concludes. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n \n\n2 RELATED LITERATURE \n \n\n \n\nThis work is related to the literatures on deforestation policies, labelling and market bans. \n\nSoybean is a major cash crop in Brazil and the Soy Moratorium acts upon a well-established \n\nmarket, where producers are well integrated with the rest of the supply chain. Pfaff (2013) \n\nmakes an overview of studies on policy impacts on deforestation in this kind of setting. In the \n\nclassic land use model, producers decide whether to deforest a land site or to manage the forest \n\nto maximize expected profits. Factors that affect profits include input and output prices, \n\ntransportation costs and risk of expropriation, in the case of insecure land tenure. The empirical \n\nevidence on conservation policies of these studies is that they are highly dependent on the \n\nlocation targeted: protected areas, for instance, have greater impact the less isolated are the \n\nlands at which they are instated (Andam et al. (2008); Pfaff et al. (2009)). \n\nOther studies have shown the role a broader policy, the Action Plan for the Prevention and \n\nControl of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (Plano de Preven\u00e7\u00e3o e Controle do \n\nDesmatamento na Amaz\u00f4nia Legal, PPCDAm), has played on the sharp reduction of \n\ndeforestation in the Legal Amazon. Assun\u00e7\u00e3o, Gandour and Rocha (2015) disentangle the \n\neffects of prices and PPCDAm policies and show that it has saved 56%, from 2005 to 2009, of \n\nlands that would have been cleared if this plan had not been implemented. Burgess, Costa and \n\nOlken (2016) use RDD on the Brazilian borders with other seven South American countries, \n\nwhere 35% of the Amazon forest is, to show these policies were impactful even on lands where \n\nthe state officials have a difficult access. \n\nThe Soy Moratorium, however, is not one these policies and, to the best of my knowledge, the \n\neconomics literature has not studied yet the effects of a market ban on deforestation. There are \n\nworks, on the other hand, that analyze its effects on different settings and outcomes, such as \n\ncattle prices (Schlenker and Villas-Boas (2009)) and illegal poaching (Lemieux and Clarke \n\n(2009)), and they suggest its effectiveness is not assured and can have unintended \n\nconsequences. For instance, Schlenker and Villas-Boas (2009) use a detailed scanner dataset \n\nfrom a large U.S. grocery chain and from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to assess the effect \n\nof two warnings on the mad cow disease: first on the Oprah Winfrey Show and, seven years \n\nlater, by government officials. They document a decrease in beef sales and abnormal price drops \n\nfor future cattle following the warnings. Lemieux and Clarke (2009) shows a positive effect of \n\nthe 1989 ivory sales ban on the African elephant population, intended to stop its fast decline \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\n \n\ndue to illegal poaching, although 37 countries were not able to enforce it and continued to watch \n\ntheir elephant population decline. \n\nSoares and Chimeli (2011) studies the effect on violence of a ban on big leaf mahogany sales \n\nin Brazil in 2004. They show that homicides rates have increased as consequence of the \n\nillegalization of this market. They also show that sales had persisted over the time, as sellers \n\ncould mask the mahogany cargoes as \u201cother tropical timber species\u201d. Also, Dell (2014) find a \n\npositive effect of crackdowns in violence in Mexico after conservative National Action Party\u2019s \n\n(PAN) candidates have won close elections. The relative increased action to combat drug \n\ntrafficking following these victories have led rival factions to fight over control over territories \n\npreviously occupied by the now weakened incumbent and have also led criminals to fight over \n\nalternative routes to transport drugs, leading to higher homicides rates where these fights \n\noccurred. \n\nThe Soy Moratorium, however, is not a government policy, but an agreement between private \n\ncompanies. Although state policies can work, could a private initiative also curb deforestation? \n\nThe literature on Fair Trade can help answering this question. Fair Trade certifications are made \n\nmostly by private association and NGOs and the Moratorium can be seen as a certification on \n\nan environmental standard. Nunn et al. (2014) provide an overview of studies on Fair Trade \n\ncertifications and concludes that Fair Trade-certified producers do receive higher prices for \n\nroughly the same amount sold by similar non-certified producers and, although they understand \n\nthat selection evidence is incomplete, they interpret previous results as indicative that the least \n\nable producers are the most likely to be certified and this imply correlational evidence may \n\nunderstate the effects of certification. I interpret this as evidence that consumers do change their \n\nchoices in response to a mechanism to signal a socially responsible product. Nunn et al. (2014) \n\nalso find that producers aiming for environmental certification adopt more environmental \n\nfriendly practices and I interpret this as indicative the environmental certification acts on \n\nenvironmental practices the same way Fair Trade certification acts on other producer\u2019s \n\npractices. Therefore, the fact that the Soy Moratorium is carried out and enforced by private \n\ncompanies is not a reason to believe it will not work. What raises concern, however, is that the \n\ncompanies enforcing the moratorium are the same potentially harmed by it, since it could result \n\nin a scarcer or more capital intensive input for them, both possibilities resulting in higher prices. \n\nAnother reason the moratorium could fail is poor land tenure. If clearance can ensure tenure or \n\nif it can make physically defending the lands easier, farmers will have an incentive to clear and \n\noccupy forest areas. This is a serious problem in Brazil, where overlapping properties are \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\n \n\ncommon: in some states, like Acre, officially registered rural properties sum up to more than \n\n200% of available lands. Also, if the lands overlap, accountability will be more difficult to \n\napply: farmers could plant soybeans on deforested lands if they think the probability of the non-\n\ncompliant soy being attributed to them is low enough. Since the annual reports on the \n\nmoratorium\u2019s monitoring does not cite this difficulty, it may not be a real threat to the \n\nagreement, but these reports are on the monitoring only, never citing the enforcement of the \n\nagreement. For further reading, Chiavari and Lopes (2016) makes a report on the history and \n\npresent state of Brazilian lands occupation and legislation. \n\nTherefore, there is enough evidence on the literature that the effect on deforestation of a market \n\nban on soybeans is not obvious. In one hand, deforestation policies have been documented to \n\nwork, the moratorium targets economically important and integrated areas, and the fact that it \n\nis a private agreement does not imply in its failure. On the other hand, the moratorium can be \n\nineffective if producers can escape its monitoring by masking their soybeans, exploiting \n\nloopholes on the agreement, have stronger incentives to plant soy on deforested lands or even \n\nif the soy buyers do not have the incentive to enforce the moratorium. \n\nAlthough I do not know other works on the economics literature to assess the effect of a market \n\nban on deforestation, I must acknowledge the work from Gibbs et al. (2015). This paper asks if \n\nthe Soy Moratorium could reduce deforestation on the Amazon Biome but do not control \n\nadequately for possible confounders. They compare the deforestation evolution inside the \n\nAmazon Biome with the deforestation evolution in the entire Cerrado and the region known as \n\nMATOPIBA. Therefore, they are saying that Cerrado regions as far as in the S\u00e3o Paulo state \n\nare good controls for the Amazon, as well as the new soybean frontier, a region with a possibly \n\nvery different dynamic from the Amazon itself. In particular, they do not control for the \n\nPPCDAm policies, since none of them are in force in most of the Cerrado, which means their \n\nresult may be due to either the Soy Moratorium or any of the plan\u2019s policies. In this regard, the \n\nauthors argue that \u201c[f]ederal enforcement mechanisms are unlikely to be an effective substitute \n\nfor the [Soy Moratorium] in the near term, because there is no simple way to identify properties \n\nthat are in compliance with the [Forest Code]\u201d. However, even if compliance is not easily \n\naddressed, the Forest Code is but one of the measures taken to control illegal deforestation and \n\nAssun\u00e7\u00e3o, Gandour and Rocha (2015), as well as Burgess, Costa and Olken (2016), gives \n\nevidence that PPCDAm is working despite this difficulty. Also, even if the Soy Moratorium \n\nhas a role in reducing deforestation, not all of it is caused by soy: cattle raising, illegal logging \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\n \n\nand the appropriation of public-owned lands by private actors, a practice known as grilagem, \n\nare also important drivers and the PPCDAm acts upon all of them (Casa Civil (2004)). \n\nTo disentangle the effects of the moratorium from those of PPCDAm, I use two levels of \n\ncontrols: the Cerrado portion of the Legal Amazon to control for the Amazon Biome and the \n\nsoy producing counties to control for the non-producing ones within each biome. Since only \n\nthe counties with at least 5000ha of soy planted are monitored by the Soy Moratorium, in this \n\nwork I define as \u201csoy producers\u201d all counties with at least 5000ha of soy planted. By restricting \n\nthe study area to the Legal Amazon, I eliminate all influence from factors other than the \n\nPPCDAm outside the Amazon Biome. Comparing this biome with the Cerrado, I control for \n\nthe effects of the plan\u2019s policies since all of them are in force within it but the moratorium is \n\nnot. Since PPCDAm may have had differential effects on the Amazon Biome than on the \n\nCerrado2, I compare deforestation outcomes between soy producers and non-soy producers \n\nwithin each biome to control for these differences. This way, I hope to select better comparison \n\ngroups and estimate a cleaner effect than Gibbs et al. (2015). \n\n \n\n  \n\n                                                             \n2 See section 3.1 \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\n \n\n3 BACKGROUND \n\n3.1 Deforestation in the Amazon  \n \n\n \n\nFrom 1991 to 2004, deforestation in the Legal Amazon has grown in almost every year, going \n\nfrom 11,030 km\u00b2 to 27,772 km\u00b2 (MMA (2017)). By that time, some characteristics of the \n\ndeforestation evolution were emphasized such as its geographic concentration and two of its \n\neconomic drivers. It was identified that most of the deforestation was concentrated along an \n\n\u201cArc\u201d, extending from the Acre\u2019s southeast to the Maranh\u00e3o\u2019s southeast, passing through \n\nRond\u00f4nia, Amazonas\u2019 south, Mato Grosso\u2019s north and Par\u00e1\u2019s south (Casa Civil (2004)). In the \n\n2000-2001 period, nearly 70% of the deforestation in the Legal Amazon occurred in Rond\u00f4nia, \n\nMato Grosso and Par\u00e1 states. Also, cattle raising and soybean planting were identified as \n\nimportant deforestation drivers in the Legal Amazon (Casa Civil (2004)). While cattle raising \n\nwas blamed for 80% all deforestation in the Legal Amazon, a 57% increase in planted area in \n\n1999-2001 period was seen as a threat to the forest. \n\nThen, in 2004, the Brazilian government launched the PPCDAm, a holistic plan to decrease the \n\ndeforestation rates. It is an integrative plan in which thirteen Ministries coordinate under the \n\nBrazilian Chief of Staff, the Brazilian Executive Office\u2019s highest-ranking member. It \u201csought \n\nto inhibit forest clearings and promote forest conservation by focusing on three main policy \n\nefforts: strengthening monitoring and law enforcement; expanding protected territory; and \n\nadopting a conditional rural credit policy\u201d (Assun\u00e7\u00e3o et al. (2015)). \n\nThe creation of DETER (Real Time Detection) system greatly improved the deforestation \n\nmonitoring, since it allowed authorities to detect deforestation occurring in 15-day time \n\nwindows. Previously, they were dependent of voluntary reports of threatened areas, making \n\ntimely location and accessing to deforestation hotspots a difficult task (Assun\u00e7\u00e3o et al. (2013)). \n\nBesides, law has changed to make deforestation a crime punishable by imprisonment and to \n\nincrease the required native vegetation inside every rural property from 35% to 80%. It became \n\nillegal, then, to deforest more than 20% a private property. Also, the demarcation of over 60 \n\nmillion hectares of Protected Lands and Indigenous Lands, areas where any deforestation is \n\neither illegal or heavily restricted, further increased the size of the land unavailable for \n\nproduction. \n\nIn 2008, two other major efforts were made: a conditional rural credit policy and the blacklisting \n\nof some counties for high priority action. Rural credit in Brazil is heavily subsidized and, for \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\n \n\nall producers inside the Amazon Biome, it became conditional on them to meet certain \n\nenvironmental criteria. Also, counties with a recent history of very high deforestation rates were \n\nblacklisted to be assigned a stronger monitoring and to suffer sanctions. In 2008, 36 counties \n\nwere blacklisted for high priority action, in 2009, seven were added and, in 2011, seven more. \n\nAlthough this blacklisting could affect any county inside the Legal Amazon, almost all of the \n\nblacklisted counties are inside the Amazon Biome. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2 The Soy Moratorium \n \n\n \n\nAs we can see in Table 1, soybean farming has been expanding into the Amazon at least since \n\n2001, with a major increase in 2005, nearly doubling the 2004 planted area. Deforestation as \n\nwell (Figure 1), grew from 2001 to 2005, reaching a peak in 2004, and many blamed the soy \n\nexpansion for this increase (Fearnside (2001), Casa Civil (2004), Watts (2005), Greenpeace \n\n(2006)). Then, in April 2006, Greenpeace organized protests at a Cargill\u2019s soybean terminal in \n\nSantar\u00e9m, Par\u00e1, and published the report \u201cEating up the Amazon\u201d. Cargill is an important soy \n\nexporter in the Amazon and these actions helped raise international awareness over the claimed \n\nrelation between deforestation and the soybean expansion into the Amazon Biome. In July of \n\nthe same year, the two greatest Amazon\u2019s soybean traders, the Brazilian Association of \n\nVegetable Oil Industries (ABIOVE) and the National Association of Cereal Exporters (ANEC) \n\n(Gibbs et al. (2015)), signed an agreement in response to the reputational risk posed to the \n\nsoybean industry by this increased attention. Under the Soy Moratorium, as it was named, these \n\nassociations pledged to no longer buy soybeans produced in areas of the Amazon Biome \n\ndeforested after July of 2006. It is important to note that, although the agreement officially cites \n\nthe non-commercialization of soy coming from non-compliant areas3(ANEC website), the \n\nADM\u2019s website, one of ABIOVE\u2019s associates, clearly states that companies do not \n\ncommercialize soy from non-compliant producers, even if their non-compliant soy is only a \n\nsmall fraction of its total production4. \n\n \n\n                                                             \n3 http://www.anec.com.br/pt-br/informacoes/moratoria-da-soja. Accessed in 03/19/2017. \n4 http://adm.com/pt-BR/worldwide/brazil/Paginas/Nossos-Compromissos.aspx Accessed in 03/19/2017. \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\n \n\nThe table shows the evolution of non-compliance to the Soy Moratorium in monitored counties for all \nyears in the sample. The moratorium was signed in 2006 but monitoring began only in 2007. In 2008 \nInpe became officially part and leader of the monitoring team. Soy data comes from Gibbs et al. (2015) \nwhile non-complying area and the number of monitored counties comes from the 2013/2014 harvest \nreport. The non-complying percentage is the division of the non-complying area in each year by the \nplanted soy area for that same year. \n\n \n\nYear Planted Soy (ha) Non-complying (ha) Non-complying (%) Monitored \n\ncounties\n\n2001 302724.7 NA NA 0\n\n2002 287678.5 NA NA 0\n\n2003 477656.1 NA NA 0\n\n2004 558299.6 NA NA 0\n\n2005 1145954.9 NA NA 0\n\n2006 1086840.4 NA NA 0\n\n2007 1039393.2 0 0 37\n\n2008 1286591.8 1384 0.107571 46\n\n2009 1290505.3 6295 0.4877934 52\n\n2010 1318709.2 11698 0.8870796 53\n\n2011 1770975.7 18410 1.03954 58\n\n2012 1726239.6 29295 1.6970413 62\n\n2013 1934465 47028 2.4310598 73\n\nTable 1: Non-compliance in monitored counties\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Deforestation by Biome \n\n \n\n  \n\nThe figure uses data from Hansen et al. (2013) to show the yearly deforestation \nincrement for the Legal Amazon. Data is shown separately for both biomes. \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\n \n\nThe traders wrote the agreement in cooperation with high profile environmental groups, such \n\nas Greenpeace and WWF-Brasil, forming the Soybean Working Group (GTS), responsible for \n\noverseeing its implementation and monitoring. The group was then divided into three \n\nsubgroups: one responsible for farmer education and campaigning, one responsible for \n\ngarnering greater support from businesses, NGOs and the federal government and one \n\nresponsible for the monitoring itself. The first monitoring occurred for the 2007/2008 harvest \n\nand did not find any non-compliant soy on monitored lands. The company hired, Globalsat \n\nMonitoramento Agr\u00edcola, monitors PRODES polygons within counties which satisfies a few \n\ncriteria, detailed below, and used a combination of aerial surveys and field visits to identify \n\nland use within each monitored polygon. The criteria used to select which polygons to monitor \n\nwere the following: \n\na) The polygon must be located within the Amazon Biome and in the states with significant \n\nsoy acreage: Mato Grosso, Par\u00e1 and Rond\u00f4nia; \n\nb) It must be located outside of protected areas (Conservation Units and Indigenous \n\nReserves); \n\nc) Be larger than 100ha; \n\nd) It must be in counties with at least 5,000ha of soy in 2006 and in the 2007/2008 crop \n\nestimate (prepared by ABIOVE); and \n\ne) The polygon must be wholly or partially contained within the Amazon Biome. \n\nThese criteria remained roughly the same throughout the years: in 2009 criterion \u201cc\u201d changed \n\nthe threshold to 25ha5; criterion \u201cb\u201d included rural settlements also in 2009, only to be dropped \n\nin 2013; criterion \u201cd\u201d changed in the following years to monitor all counties with at least \n\n5,000ha planted at the current monitoring year or estimated to cross this threshold on the \n\nfollowing. Note that the monitoring area overlaps the deforestation \u201cArc\u201d. \n\nThe most important change in the monitoring process occurred in 2008, when the Brazilian \n\nEnvironment Ministry (MMA) officially joined the GTS, making the Space Research Institute \n\n(INPE) the leader of the efforts to monitor the soybean growth at the areas deforested after the \n\ncut-off date. Satellite image analysis, then, were used to guide aerial surveys and field visits \n\nand, eventually, substituted both as its reliability increased to the point of making them \n\n                                                             \n5 From the 4th monitoring on, the criterion was to monitor aggregated polygons, instead of polygons, greater than \n25ha. Aggregated polygons are composed by smaller ones from previous years, e.g., if PRODES registered two \nseparate 10ha polygons in previous years and, in the current year, another 10ha between those such that they are \nall adjacent, the three are aggregated to create a single 30ha polygon. \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\n \n\nredundant. Since then, year by year, the monitoring has been accusing an increasing number of \n\nnon-compliant soy areas, although it is very small even at its peak6. Part of this increase is due \n\nto the inclusion of counties in the monitoring group throughout the years. Table 1 also show \n\nthis evolution. \n\nOriginally, the moratorium was a two-year agreement, but it has been renewed annually since \n\n2008. As of May 9, 2016, the agreement was renewed indefinitely and this shows the \n\nimportance given to the agreement by the government, the environmental groups and the \n\nsoybean buyers and exporters. The confidence on its effectiveness comes mainly from the high \n\ncompliance rate and the reports\u2019 analyses showing a decrease in deforestation rates on the Legal \n\nAmazon and on monitored counties after 2008. However, I believe the analyses are flawed for \n\nnot considering alternative causes, like PPCDAm policies, and for questionable treatment group \n\ndefinitions. \n\n \n\n \n\n4 DATA \n \n\n \n\nIn this work, I use georeferenced data for deforestation and soy production from Hansen et al. \n\n(2013) and Gibbs et al. (2015) respectively. \n\nHansen et al. (2013) make available georeferenced data for world\u2019s annual tree cover loss. From \n\n2001 to 2013, it registers for each pixel the first year after 2000 that it lost canopy. Each pixel\u2019s \n\nresolution is 1 arc-second, which is equivalent to 30m at the Equator, and \u201ctree\u201d is defined as \n\nall vegetation taller than 5m. I restrict attention to the area within the Legal Amazon, to both \n\nthe Amazon and the Cerrado Biomes7. \n\nTo track the soy farming across the Legal Amazon, I use georeferenced data for soy farming in \n\nthe Amazon biome and crop farming in the Brazilian Cerrado, respectively, taken from Gibbs \n\net al (2015). The soy data comes from the analysis of the biome portion of 88 counties with at \n\nleast 1000ha in soy production, comprising the three states of Mato Grosso, Par\u00e1 and Rond\u00f4nia. \n\n                                                             \n6 There was only one drop after the study period, however: in 2014 the cut-off date moved from July 2006 to \nJuly 2008, in accordance with the new Forest Code, and amnesty was given to all deforestation occurred up to \nthe new date. \n7 Biomes\u2019 and Legal Amazon treated georeferenced data comes from IBGE and as courtesy of CPI. \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\n \n\nThe GTS (Soy Working Group) monitors only those counties with over 5000ha in soy \n\nproduction, meaning this data can capture actions at unmonitored lands. Since 73 counties were \n\nmonitored in the 2013/2014 harvest season, the data contains 15 counties more and provide \n\nalmost 72.000km\u00b2 of additional area, or 34% of monitored counties\u2019 area. This data also ranges \n\nfrom 2001 to 2014. \n\nGibbs et al (2015), used machine learning to identify crop farming for the entire Cerrado at \n\n250m resolution, beginning in 2001 and ending in 2013. The algorithm identified areas of at \n\nleast 1km\u00b2 of mechanized crop production. It is important to emphasize that I don\u2019t have spatial \n\ndata for soy production at this biome, only for crop farming, which can potentially include any \n\ncrop planted in the region, such as cotton and rice. However, as the authors argue, the \n\nclassification approach targeted the soy growing season and, as they write: \n\nIn much of the soy-producing region of the Amazon and the Cerrado, two and sometimes three crops \nare planted per year, but in nearly all cases one of those crops is soy. Soy is by far the most reliably \nprofitable crop produced at large scales; as such, most farmers produce only soybeans during the \nsoybean \u201cseason\u201d (roughly September to January, with some variation across the regions). \nCommercial silos are also unlikely to accept crops other than soy at the beginning of the year, further \ndiscouraging production of other crops. Cotton is the only other major crop planted at roughly the \nsame time as soy in the Cerrado. However, cotton is typically planted 30-60 days after soybeans \nbecause of the different end dates of the obligatory \u201csanitary periods\u201d for the two crops. In regions \nwhere only one crop per year is typical, soybean is part of most interannual rotational systems at the \nlarge scales our analysis targeted. \n\nTherefore, I also assume the most part of the crop raster data is comprised of soy and use the \n\ncrop data as if it was equivalent to soy. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.1 Deforestation Measures \n \n\n \n\nTriple-differences estimates\u2019 significance, as well as DD ones, depends on the functional form \n\nof the outcome variable. Hence, to better assess the effects of the Soy Moratorium, I use two \n\ndeforestation measures: the deforestation rate and the normalized deforestation increment. \n\nThe deforestation rate is defined as the lost fraction of previous year remaining forest. For \n\ninstance, let ?????  be the annual deforestation increment and ????  the total forested area at \n\ncounty ? and year ?. The deforestation rate ????  is then defined as \n\n???? =\n?????  \n\n??????\n \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\n \n\nNote that since Hansen\u2019s deforestation data marks a given pixel as either \u201cnot deforested since \n\n2000\u201d or \u201cdeforested in ????\u201d, where ???? ranges from 2001 to 2013, I can calculate the \n\ndeforestation rate for all years in the sample. \n\nThe normalized deforestation, in turn, is defined as the deviation from the time mean, in \n\nstandard deviations, of the deforestation increment. Then, if ????????? and ??\n???  are the average \n\ndeforestation increment and the standard deviation of the deforestation increment of unit ? \n\nfrom 2001 to 2013, the normalized deforestation ????  is defined as \n\n???? =\n????? ? ?????????\n\n??\n???  \n\n \n\nNote that both measures account for variations in the deforestation increment due to different \n\nunit sizes. \n\n \n\n \n\n5 EMPIRICAL STRATEGY \n \n\n \n\nA simple before-after estimate would confound the effects of the Soy Moratorium with the \n\neffects of PPCDAm policies. Since the moratorium is valid only for the Amazon Biome, I use \n\nthe Cerrado portion of the Legal Amazon as a control group to the Amazon Biome. To eliminate \n\ndifferences in deforestation changes due to differences between biomes, I compare, within each \n\nbiome, soy producing counties and non-soy producing ones. Therefore, I make a triple-\n\ndifference (DDD) estimate by comparing the double-difference between soy producing and \n\nnon-soy producing counties inside the Amazon Biome with the same double-difference inside \n\nthe Cerrado. \n\nSoy producer and non-producer definitions are based on the monitoring criteria presented in \n\nsection 3.2, which I modify to better suit my data. In particular, since I have only raster data \n\nthere were no polygons for the deforestation at the Cerrado to classify as producer or non-\n\nproducer for all the studied years. Therefore, I define counties, not polygons, as being soy \n\nproducers or non-soy producers and alter the criteria accordingly. For the Amazon Biome, I \n\ndrop criterion \u201cc\u201d, since it only makes sense for polygons and substitute \u201ccounty\u201d for \u201cpolygon\u201d \n\nin criteria \u201ca\u201d and \u201ce\u201d. I also drop criterion \u201cb\u201d, for my objective is to capture both direct and \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\n \n\nindirect deforestation caused by the soy expansion. Criterion \u201cd\u201d is then modified to classify as \n\nsoy producing those counties with at least 5,000ha of soy in 2006, when the agreement was \n\nsigned. I adopt these same modified criteria to the Cerrado, except criterion \u201ca\u201d, which I drop \n\ncompletely. Then, the criteria for each biome becomes the following: \n\n1) Amazon Biome \n\na) The county must be located within the Amazon Biome and in the states with significant \n\nsoy acreage: Mato Grosso, Par\u00e1 and Rond\u00f4nia; \n\nb) The county must have at least 5000ha of soy in 2006; and \n\nc) The county must be wholly or partially contained within the Amazon Biome. \n\n2) Cerrado \n\na) The county must have at least 5000ha of soy in 2006; and \n\nb) The county must be wholly or partially contained within the Cerrado. \n\nNote that since the Soy Moratorium affects only counties with at least 5000ha of soy, these are \n\nalso the criteria used to assigned counties into treatment and control groups for each biome. \n\nAlthough the moratorium is only valid to the Amazon Biome, I assume counties which satisfy \n\nthe criteria for the Cerrado would also be affected by the agreement if it was extended to this \n\nbiome. Hence, in this work, \u201ctreated\u201d and \u201cuntreated\u201d are synonyms to \u201csoy producer\u201d and \n\n\u201cnon-soy producer\u201d respectively. \n\nIn total, there are 82 soy producing and 691 non-soy producing counties in all Legal Amazon. \n\nHowever, 96 of them lies simultaneously on both biomes. Hence, my observation unit is not \n\nthe county, but the county portion contained in each biome. Therefore, a soy producing county \n\nlying in both biomes generate two observation units, one on the Amazon Biome and the other \n\non the Cerrado, both counting as soy producing units. Table 2 shows the number of observation \n\nunits for each biome, sample and category.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\n \n\nThe table shows the number of soy producing and non-producing observation units in \neach sample. Each unit is one \u201ccounty x biome\u201d combination. Soy producer is defined \nas a county with at least 5000ha in soy planted, according to the criteria presented in \nsection 5. The full sample includes all Amazon Biome counties. The 10km and 100km \nsamples include all soy producers and all non-producers in a 10km and 100km buffer, \nrespectively, from soy producers. Administrative and biome data comes from IBGE. \nSoy data comes from Gibbs et al. (2015). \n\nSample Soy Producers Non-producers\n\nCerrado 65 258\n\nAmazon (Full Sample) 38 508\n\nAmazon (100km Sample) 38 179\n\nAmazon (10km Sample) 38 76\n\nTable 2: Observation units per biome, sample and \n\ncategory\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFrom now on, I will simply use \u201ccounty\u201d as equivalent to the combination \u201ccounty x biome\u201d. \n\nFor each county, I calculate the three measures defined in the Data section: the deforestation \n\nrate, deforestation increment\u2019s natural logarithm and the normalized deforestation. The \n\ntreatment group is defined as all the counties satisfying the eligibility criteria described in the \n\nBackground section and the control group is comprised of all counties inside the Amazon \n\nBiome that do not satisfy them. To further control for differences between soy producing and \n\nnon-soy producing counties, I use the Cerrado as a comparison group to the Amazon Biome, \n\nalso applying the eligibility criteria for its counties. \n\nTo study the effect of the Soy Moratorium, I use two different empirical specifications. Two \n\ndifferences-in-differences (DD), one for the Amazon Biome and other for the soy producing \n\ncounties, are used to better understand the dynamics affecting the counties in each of these \n\ngroups. My main specification is a triple-differences estimation with year and county fixed \n\neffects. Placebos to test the parallel trends assumption are presented at the end of this section. \n\n  \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\n \n\n5.1 Differences-in-differences equations \n \n\n \n\nTo better capture the dynamics of deforestation in the Legal Amazon concerning the differences \n\nbetween the soy producing counties and the biomes, the first two estimating equations are the \n\nfollowing DD \n\n??? = ?? + ?? + ???{? ? ????}?{? ? ????????} +  ???  \n\n \n\nand \n\n??? = ?? + ?? + ???{? ? ????}?{? ? ??????} +  ???  \n\nwhere ???  is the deforestation measure at county ? and year ?, ??  and ?? are the county and \n\nyear fixed effects, ?{? ? ??????} and ?{? ? ????????} indicates if county ? is inside the Amazon \n\nBiome and if it is a soy producer, ?{? ? ????} indicates the period after the moratorium was signed \n\nand ???  is the error. The coefficient of interest in both equations is ?? as it captures any change \n\nin mean ???  after 2006 for each of those groups. \n\nWith equation (1) I try to capture differential effects on soy producing counties relative to non-\n\nproducing, such as those of rural credit conditioning for producers inside the Amazon Biome. \n\nAssun\u00e7\u00e3o et al. (2013), finds the credit conditioning affected differently cattle producers credit \n\nconcession and crop producers\u2019. \n\nSimilarly, equation (2) tries to capture differential effects on Amazon counties relative to \n\nCerrado ones. The said conditioning is one example but as well as the blacklisting of Legal \n\nAmazon counties with high deforestation rates. Assun\u00e7\u00e3o et al. (2014) shows the priority action \n\nhas reduced the deforestation in the Legal Amazon from 2008 to 2011 by 35%. Assun\u00e7\u00e3o et al. \n\n(2013) also shows that the credit conditioning curbed deforestation in the Amazon Biome. Note \n\nthis is a slight modification to the strategy used by Gibbs et al. (2015): while it compares the \n\nAmazon Biome with the entire Cerrado, I compare the former only with the Cerrado portion of \n\nthe Legal Amazon. \n\nNote that neither (1) nor (2) tries to capture causal effects but, if the Soy Moratorium had any \n\neffect on deforestation, both estimations may give significant estimates for ??. \n\n  \n\n(1) \n\n(2) \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\n \n\n5.2 Triple-differences \n \n\n \n\nUsing the same definitions as before, my main estimation equation is \n\n??? = ?? + ?? + ???{? ? ????}?{? ? ??????} + ???{? ? ????}?{? ? ????????} +\n\n???{? ? ????}?{? ? ??????}?{? ? ????????} + ??? \n\n  \n\nThe coefficient of interest is ?? as it captures the change in the mean deforestation, measured \n\nby ???, in soy producing counties and inside the Amazon Biome after the Soy Moratorium \n\nbegan. The identifying assumption needed for ?? to be the causal effect of the Soy Moratorium \n\non deforestation is that, on the absence of the agreement, the difference in the deforestation \n\nmeasure between soy producing and non-soy producing counties inside the Amazon Biome \n\nwould have followed the same trend as the difference in the deforestation measure between soy \n\nproducing and non-soy producing counties on the Cerrado portion of the Legal Amazon.  \n\nThe coefficient ?? nets out any difference in the mean ??? , starting in 2006, due to any change \n\nother than the Soy Moratorium occurring inside the Amazon Biome. The coefficient ??, on its \n\nturn, nets out any difference in the mean ??? , starting in 2006, due to changes other than the \n\nmoratorium affecting soy producing counties. If any of the previous DD estimations finds a \n\nsignificant effect I expect the coefficients for the Amazon Biome and for soy producing counties \n\nto lose at least part of their significance if the moratorium was indeed effective. \n\nNote, however, as we can see in Figure 2, soy farming is concentrated close to the border \n\nbetween biomes. Therefore, lands too far away from it may not be good controls for soy \n\nproducing counties. I account for this estimating the triple-differences, as well as both double-\n\ndifferences, for three different samples inside the Amazon Biome: the Full Sample, the 100km \n\nSample and the 10km Sample. The Full Sample includes all counties within the biome. The \n\n100km sample include all soy producing counties and all non-soy producing that intersect a \n\n100km buffer around the soy producing ones. The 10km Sample include all soy producing \n\ncounties and all non-soy producing that intersect a 10km buffer around the soy producing ones. \n\nThe Cerrado sample was kept intact and was used alongside each of those samples. \n\n  \n\n(3) \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 - Soy planted area at each biome in 2006 \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nThe figure shows how the soy production was distributed at the Cerrado portion of the Legal Amazon (within \nthe red border), and the Amazon Biome in 2006. Soy data for the Legal Amazon comes from two datasets: one \ncontains soy data for the Amazon Biome and the other contains crop data for the Cerrado. The crop data may \nshow not only soy, but also cotton and rice. However, since it was collected in the soy growing season and it \nis unlikely that any other crop is extensively produced at the same time, I use crop as if it were composed only \nby soy. Administrative data comes from IBGE and soy and crop data comes from Gibbs et al. (2015). \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\n \n\n5.3 Testing pre-trend assumptions \n \n\n \n\nBefore turning to the results, it is useful to see how the specifications fare in tests for the pre-\n\ntrend equality in all the three specifications, for both measures and for the main sample, the \n\n10km sample. The tests for the other samples are in the Appendix (Tables A1 and A2). \n\nIn this test, I use equations (1), (2) and (3) with data ranging from 2001 to 2005 to detect \n\npossible differences in trends before the Soy Moratorium came into effect. The cutoff year is \n\n2004 and I test the null hypothesis that trends before 2006 are equal for the treatment and control \n\ngroups. For specifications (1) and (2), the double differences for soy producers and the Amazon \n\nBiome respectively, this means that ?? should be equal zero and for specification (3), the triple \n\ndifferences, ?? should be equal zero. Note that while these tests check for differences in \n\ndeforestation trends in the first two specifications, in specification (3) it checks for different \n\ntrends in the deforestation difference between soy producer counties and non-producers. For \n\ninstance, rejecting the null hypothesis in the triple differences is to say the deforestation \n\ndifference between soy producer counties and non-producers inside the Amazon biome follows \n\na different path than the deforestation difference between soy producers and non-producers at \n\nthe Cerrado portion of the Legal Amazon. \n\nAs we can see in Table 3 the tests reject the equal trends hypothesis for specification (1) with \n\nboth measures but do not reject for specifications (2) and (3). This means deforestation in soy \n\nproducing counties were already following a different path than non-producers at the Legal \n\nAmazon even prior to the Soy Moratorium but deforestation in Amazonian counties had the \n\nsame trend than in those within the Cerrado. Note that even with parallel trends, the double \n\ndifference for the biomes still cannot yield a causal effect for the moratorium, since it does not \n\nseparate its effects from the PPCDAm. Also, the tests find no evidence of differential trends in \n\nthe deforestation differences between soy producers and non-producers at the Amazon biome \n\nand between producers and non-producers at the Cerrado. Therefore, there are evidence that, in \n\nthis sample, the counties at the Cerrado portion of the Legal Amazon form a good control group \n\nfor the soy producer counties within the Amazon biome and their neighbors. \n\n  \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\n \n\nThis table shows the results of the common pre-trend tests for the 10km sample. The data ranges from \n2001 to 2005 and \u201cpost\u201d means that year is greater than or equal 2004. The observation unit is the \ncombination county x biome and there are 405 of them for all estimations. The specifications are two DD \nand one DDD. The two DD compare the Amazon and the Cerrado biomes and soy producing observation \nunits with non-producers respectively. The DDD use the comparison between producing and non-\nproducing units within the Cerrado as a control to the comparison between producers and non-producers \nwithin the Amazon Biome. For each specification and measure, I test the null hypothesis that trends before \n2006 are equal and fixed effects are used for year and the \u201ccounty x biome\u201d combination.

Results for \n\nthe 100km and the full samples are presented in the Appendix (Tables A3 and A4, respectively). \n\nAs we can see in Table 4 the estimations for the deforestation rate gives negative and significant \n\nresults for both differences-in-differences estimates of ???????? \u00d7 ???????? and \n\n???????? \u00d7 ????????????. This is consistent with the belief the moratorium would have \n\nthe effect to slowdown deforestation in the affected units. However, when we turn to the DDD \n\nestimates, we see that the coefficient for the agreement is not significant and the other two \n\ncoefficients keep their direction and significance. Since the pre-trends test for this estimation \n\ndid not reject the equal trends hypothesis, I interpret this as evidence the Soy Moratorium had \n\nno effect to slowdown the deforestation rate and, instead, that something else had a differential \n\nimpact on counties inside the Amazon Biome and on soy producing counties in both biomes. \n\nThis can also be seen on Table 5, which shows the non-parametric estimates for the Soy \n\nMoratorium: from 2001 to 2012, almost all coefficients, before and after 2006, are zero. \n\nThe results for the normalized deforestation follow a similar pattern, with the coefficients for \n\n???????? \u00d7 ??o????? and ???????? \u00d7 ??????????o? negative and significant for the \n\nthree specifications. The difference, however, is that the coefficient for the moratorium is \n\npositive and significant. Since the pre-trend test did not reject the equal trends hypothesis for \n\nthis estimation, I interpret this as indicative that the Soy Moratorium has caused an increase in \n\ndeforestation. This can be seen in Table 5, where the coefficient\u2019s mean from 2001 to 2005 is  \n\n-1.5 and, from 2006 to 2012, close to -0.85. \n\nAlthough these two results, the zero and the positive effects, are contradictory, both agree with \n\nthe idea that the Soy Moratorium has not helped to reduce deforestation in the Amazon Biome. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n30 \n \n\n \n\nThis table shows the regression estimates of the coefficients of interest in specifications (1), (2) and (3) for the \n10km sample.

But the idea criticized by the present work to the previous \n\nevaluations is that compliance is not enough evidence to support the claim that the Soy \n\nMoratorium has curbed deforestation at the studied period. If any other policy to reduce \n\ndeforestation, namely those under the PPCDAm, were effective by the time of the moratorium, \n\nthen compliance could have happened anyway and, as stated before, Assun\u00e7\u00e3o et al. (2014), \n\nAssun\u00e7\u00e3o et al. (2015) and Burgess et al. (2016) presents evidence they did work. \n\nIt is important to note, also, that previous evaluations looked only at direct deforestation. \n\nTherefore, even if the Soy Moratorium had inhibited soybeans into native forests, it may have \n\ncaused indirect deforestation elsewhere. Let\u2019s say there is a producer owning three plots of land: \n\none with soy, one with cattle and one with a native forest that could be legally deforested. Under \n\nthe agreement, the producer can be punished if they plant soy into the forest plot, but he could, \n\ninstead, burn down the area, transfer the cattle raising to it and then plant soy into the now \n\nvacant plot without any punishment, as depicted in Figure 3. Indeed, Rudorff et al. (2011) and \n\nBrown and Koeppe (2013) points that soy is often not the first crop to be planted in recently \n\ndeforested areas: rice is an alternative, usually to prepare the land to receive soybeans, as well \n\nas raising cattle if crop prices are too low (Rudorff et al. (2011)). Hence, it is possible that the \n\nsoybean is displacing less lucrative products as a response to the moratorium. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\n \n\nUnder the Soy Moratorium, the owner of three plots of lands as depicted at \nthe top, in which the forest plot could be legally deforested under the \nBrazilian law, could increase its soy production by deforesting the forest plot, \ntransferring the cattle to the now vacant area and then planting soy where the \ncattle was. All of it suffering none of the moratorium\u2019s sanctions. \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Indirect deforestation induced by the Soy Moratorium \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\n \n\n8 CONCLUSION \n \n\n \n\nMany have pointed to the soybean expansion into the Amazon Biome as an important driver of \n\nits deforestation and to fight it, Greenpeace has pressed the soy industry to halt the production \n\ninside the biome. In response to the reputational threat, two of the biggest soy buyers\u2019 \n\nassociations has signed the Soy Moratorium. Seen as a successful program, it has been renewed \n\nannually despite the lack of effective evaluation. \n\nIn this work, I estimate double-differences and triple-differences regressions comparing the \n\nAmazon Biome to the Cerrado and soy producing counties with non-soy producing to study if \n\na market ban on soybeans, and market bans in general, can help reduce deforestation. My results \n\nsuggest the moratorium had no effect to curb deforestation.  \n\nAlthough only a first approach, this work may be seen as another evidence that a market ban \n\nmay not work if there are forms of escaping its sanctions. Future research may look for another \n\nstrategy such as changing the comparison groups, fining the observation unit from counties to \n\npixels and even change the estimating equations. All to avoid possible confounders that were \n\nnot eliminated by the chosen strategy. \n\n  \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n \n\n \n\nAndam, K. S., Ferraro, P.

Soy producer is defined as a county with at least 5000ha in soy planted. \nThe observation unit is the combination county x biome and there are 869 of them for all estimations. Fixed \neffects for year and observation units are used. Errors are clustered by observation units and are shown in \nparenthesis.
