Introduction\n\n The area of this study is located \nalong the eastern edge of the Quadri-\nl\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero (QFe) (Dorr 1969) in \nthe central portion of Minas Gerais \nstate between the districts of Santa Rita \nDur\u00e3o and Bento Rodrigues in a region \nknown as F\u00e1brica Nova (Fig. 1).\n\nIn general, the QFe is comprised of \nthree major sets of rock units: the meta-\nmorphic complexes of Archean age, the \nmetavolcanic-metassedimentary rock-\ntype sequence of the greenstone-belt of \n\nArchean age, corresponding to the Rio \ndas Velhas Supergroup, and the Paleo-\nproterozoic supracrustal rocks of the \nMinas Supergroup and Itacolomi Group \n(e.g. Dorr et al. 1957, Dorr 1969, Cor-\ndani et al. 1980, Schorscher et al. 1982, \nRomano 1989, Noce 1995, Machado et \nal. 1996, Alkmim &amp; Marshak 1998).\n\n The regional structure of the \nQFe is the result of the superposition \nof two main tectonic events (Chemale \nJr. et al. 1991), namely the Transama-\n\nzonian (2.1 \u2013 2.0 Ga) and Brasiliano \n(0.8 \u2013 0.6 Ga) orogenies. The first \nevent produced the regional recum-\nbent synclines and anticlines on the \nsupracrustal rocks and the uplifting \nof gneissic-granite rocks arranged in \nstructures like a nappe (Almeida 2004, \nEndo et al. 2005), and the second \ncaused the inversion, amplification, \ntranslation and crustal rotation of the \nsynclines and anticlines around the \ndome structures.\n\nFigure 1\nA summary geological map of the QFe \nand the location of the study area. \nAxial trace of Mangabeiras syncline (1), \nMoeda syncline (2), \nDom Bosco syncline (3), \nGandarela syncline (4), \nVargem do Lima syncline (5), \nSanta Rita syncline (6), \nMariana anticline (7), \nFurquim anticline (8), \nOuro Fino syncline (9), \nSanto Ant\u00f4nio anticline (10) \n(model by Dorr 1969, Romano 1989, \nEndo 1997, Almeida 2004, Endo et al. \n2004, Endo et al. 2005).\n\n The eastern edge of the QFe repre-\nsents the border between the S\u00e3o Fran-\ncisco craton and the Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed Belt (e.g., \nAlkmim et al. 2006), and its structure \nis conditioned by the Fund\u00e3o-Cambotas \n(Endo &amp; Fonseca 1992) and \u00c1gua Quente \nthrust fault systems (Maxwell 1972, Fer-\nreira F\u00ba. 1999). The Santa Rita syncline \n(Fig. 1) is located within this system and, \naccording to Dorr (1969) and Maxwell \n(1972), it is characterized as an asymmet-\nric synform with a N-NE and N-S trend-\ning axis; it is open in the southern section \nand narrow in the northern section, with \na subhorizontal plunge. The flanks are \nsubparallels, and the overturned flank is \nsectioned by the \u00c1gua Quente fault, which \nis of submeridian trace. The stratigraphic \nunits on the overturned flank are thin-\n\nner than its normal counterpart flank \nlocated to the west. Schists, phyllites, and \nferruginous quartzites belonging to the \nPiracicaba and Sabar\u00e1 groups are present \nin the core.\n\n Dorr (1969) argued that mesoscopic \nfold axes show subhorizontal plunge with \naxial trace parallel to the bedding direc-\ntion in contrast. In turn Endo (1997) de-\nscribed fold axes with moderate plunging \naround 45\u00ba toward the E-SE. At the hinge \nof the Santa Rita syncline, the bedding \nshows steep dipping to the E bisected by \npenetrative regional schistosity, with an \nintersection lineation parallel to the corre-\nsponding mineral and stretching lineation \nplunging toward the E-SE (e.g. Ferreira F\u00ba. \n1999, Ferreira F\u00ba. &amp; Fonseca 2001). This \nrelationship between the linear fabrics \n\npredominates in the QFe region (Chemale \nJr. et al. 1991, Alves 1991, Alkmim &amp; \nMarshak 1998, Franco 2003, Almeida \n2004, Endo 1997, Endo et al. 2005).\n\nAccording to the models of Dorr \n(1969) and Maxwell (1972), the correct \nposition of the Santa Rita syncline hinge \nhas not been determined so far. Contem-\nporary structures such as the Gandarela \nand Ouro Fino synclines, have hinges with \nE-SE plunges parallel to the intersection \nand mineral stretching lineations at ap-\nproximately 100/45 (Franco 2003, Endo \net al. 2004). The bedding trace contour \nof the Minas Supergroup units of the \nF\u00e1brica Nova region seems to indicate a \n\u201cZ\u201d type folding geometry (Fig. 3). If this \nhypothesis is correct, the syncline closure \nshould occur in its southern section.\n\n\n\n155\n\nDaniel Quinaud Rossi and Issamu Endo\n\nREM: R. Esc.

Materials and Methods\n\nThis study was conducted in two \nphases. The first phase involved regional \nlithostructural mapping on a 1:5.000 \nscale, and the second stage included \ndetailed mapping of the northern and \nsouthern pits of the F\u00e1brica Nova \nmine (Fig. 2) on a 1:2.000 scale. The \nlithostratigraphic and structural data \n\ncollected from this semi-detailed geologi-\ncal map enabled the proposal of a geo-\nlogical model for the Santa Rita syncline, \nespecially with regard to the geometry of \nthe F\u00e1brica Nova region. The structural \ndata collected during the mapping were \nlaunched in stereograms using GEOrient \n(v. 9.0) software. \n\nBased on structural criteria pro-\nposed by Harland (1956), Hansen \n(1971), Robertson (1994), Hsue (1995), \nand Xypolias (2010), the study area was \ndivided into two structural domains ac-\ncording to their structural styles, geom-\netry, and fabric properties: eastern and \nwestern (Fig. 3). \n\nFigure 3\nThe structural domains\n\n adopted in the regional mapping.\n\n\n\n156\n\nA structural model of the F\u00e1brica Nova region, Santa Rita syncline, Quadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero: flanking folds as a folding mechanism\n\nREM: R. Esc. Minas, Ouro Preto, 68(2), 153-162, apr. jun. | 2015\n\n3. Results\n\nThe structural analysis was based \non the structural framework from dif-\n\nferent observation scales (e.g. Williams \n1985, Xypolias 2010). To better describe \n\nthe structures, they were arranged into \nmesoscopic and macroscopic categories.\n\nMesoscopic Structures\nBedding\n\nThe bedding was defined by the \nvariation in the particle size of the quartz \ngrains in the quartzites of the Moeda \nand Cercadinho formations and the \nSabar\u00e1 Group as well as the alternating \nlaminae rich in quartz and the hematite-\nmagnetite-goethite in the itabirite of the \nCau\u00ea Formation. \n\nThe bedding planes of quartzites of \nthe Sabar\u00e1 Group in the eastern domain \nshows a NW-SE direction and dipping \ntoward to NE at 056/54 (Fig. 6a). The bed-\nding in the western domain was preserved \nin all of the units of the Minas Supergroup \nwith a preferential NW-SE direction at the \nsouth and an E-W direction at the north of \n\nthe domain, with a maximum of approxi-\nmately 172/48 (Fig. 6b). The dispersion of \nthe bedding orientation suggests the acting \nof the F4 folding phase with an axial trend \nat approximately 117/33. This fold, named \nF\u00e1brica Nova synform, is characterized as \nan open, subcylindrical and asymmetric \nfold with plunge.\n\nStructures of the First Deformation Phase (F\n1\n)\n\nThe structures that reflect this \nphase are represented by tight and asym-\nmetric mesofolds, most likely associated \nwith an S1 foliation oblique to the bed-\nding. The rare asymmetric folds, relicts \nof this phase, have a \u201cZ\u201d pattern. In one \nof the few outcrops where the structures \nof this deformation phase were found, \n\nthe bedding and S1 foliation relationship \nobserved presents a clockwise vorticity \nin a \u201cZ\u201d pattern, which are preserved \nin the sericitic schist. In the silvery phyl-\nlite layer, the bedding and S\n\n2\n foliation \n\nrelationship exhibits a counterclockwise \nvorticity in an \u201cS\u201d pattern. The interfer-\nence relationship is characterized by the \n\nsuperposition of the S\n2\n regional schistos-\n\nity folding the S\n1\n foliation with the same \n\nvorticity pattern as the F\n2\n deformation \n\nphase (Fig. 4). \nHowever, the original characteris-\n\ntics of this fabric were mostly obliterated \nby the subsequent deformation phases in \nmost of the studied region.\n\nFigure 4\nA schematic drawing of a sample \nfrom the Cercadinho Formation at a me-\nsoscopic scale showing the superposition \nof two deformation phases represented \nby the S1 and S2 foliations with opposite \nvorticities. Plane view XZ strain axes.\n\nStructures of the Second Deformation Phase (F\n2\n)\n\nThe S\n2\n regional schistosity is a pen-\n\netrative planar fabric characterized by the \npreferential orientation of minerals such as \nsericite (Fig. 5a), hematite, and quartz. In \nthe eastern domain, the S\n\n2\n schistosity has \n\nan attitude of approximately 066/55 (Fig. \n6c). In the western domain, the arrange-\n\nment of the mapped units clearly expresses \na folded system in which the S\n\n2\n schistos-\n\nity shows an attitude of approximately \n082/43 (Fig. 6d). The attitude of the axis \nof this fold (B\n\n4\n) is 104/40. The F2 folds, \n\nwhich have been mostly mapped in the \nF\u00e1brica Nova mine, are tight folds with \n\nan axis plunging slightly to the ESE and a \nmajor attitude of approximately 119/21 in \nthe northern pit (subdomain IIa; Fig. 6e) \nand 093/17 in the southern pit (subdomain \nIIb; Fig. 6f). These folds are asymmetric \nwith \u201cS\u201d patterns, furthermore, they have \nwavelengths and amplitudes on the order \n\nThe structural asymmetry and the \nvorticity were characterized according \nto the down-plunging view of the fold \naxis or the intersection lineation (Pass-\nchier &amp; Williams 1996, Xypolias 2009 \nand 2010). The characteristics of each \ndomain are as follows:\n\nThe eastern domain encompasses \nthe units of the Sabar\u00e1 Group (e.g. Gair \n1958, Barbosa 1968, Renger et al. 1994, \nAlmeida 2004, Almeida et al. 2005) \n\nand the Santa B\u00e1rbara Complex (Dorr \n1969, Herz 1970). The structural data \nobtained in this field suggests that the \nrocks of these units are folded as to \nform an antiform F\n\n2\n with axis plunging \n\ntoward to ESE.\nThe Minas Supergroup (Dorr \n\n1969) units comprise the western do-\nmain on an overturned stratigraphic \nposition. The outline of these units \nforms a structure that resembles a \n\nboomerang geometry and a \u201cZ\u201d fold-\ning pattern associated with a clockwise \nvorticity. The Bento Rodrigues fault \ndetermines the boundary between these \ntwo structural domains.\n\nDue to structural characteristics \nthe western domain can be divided into \ntwo subdomains: IIa and IIb, which cor-\nrespond to the northern and southern \npits, respectively, of the F\u00e1brica Nova \nmine (Fig. 3). \n\n\n\n157\n\nDaniel Quinaud Rossi and Issamu Endo\n\nREM: R.

Among the structures of \n\nthis phase, a mesofold occurring in the \nwestern portion of the F\u00e1brica Nova \nnorthern pit stands out. This fold is an \nopen antiform with a wavelength of ap-\nproximately 200 meters and an ampli-\ntude of a few tens of a meter whose axis \nexhibits an attitude of 081/43 (Fig. 7b). \nThe core of this fold is formed by silvery \nphyllites of the Cercadinho Formation.\n\nFigure 6\nStereograms \n\nof the major structures.\n\nStructures of the Fourth Deformation Phase (F\n4\n)\n\nThe F4 deformation phase was re-\nsponsible for the final arrangement of the \nF\u00e1brica Nova region, and its manifesta-\ntion is represented in the F\u00e1brica Nova \nsynform, a fold with an ESE plunging \n\naxis and a boomerang-like geometry in \nplain view. The structures of this phase \nare primarily represented by S\n\n4\n crenula-\n\ntion cleavages observed in itabirites of \nthe Cau\u00ea Formation and in schists of the \n\nSabar\u00e1 Group. The general direction of the \nS\n\n4\n cleavage is N-S with an average attitude \n\nof 280/72 (Fig. 7c). Tight folds with steep \naxial plane and N-S trending axis are also \nattributed to this deformation phase.\n\nStructures of the Fifth Deformation Phase (F\n5\n)\n\nThe records of the fracture system \nin the F\u00e1brica Nova mine demonstrate \n\nthe occurrence of two preferential direc-\ntions, orthogonal to each other.

Esc. Minas, Ouro Preto, 68(2), 153-162, apr. jun. | 2015\n\nMacroscopic Structures\nBento Rodrigues Fault: General Aspects and Kinematics\n\nThe major fault of the F\u00e1brica \nNova region, hereaf ter called the \nBento Rodrigues fault, bisects the en-\ntire mapped area, from south of Bento \nRodrigues village, crossing the border \neast of the F\u00e1brica Nova mine to north \nuntil Santa Rita Dur\u00e3o village. In the \nsouthern portion of the map, west of \nBento Rodrigues, the fault trace has \nan NNW-SSE direction. In the central \nportion, near the F\u00e1brica Nova mine, \nthe fault trace changes its orientation \n\nto E-W, bearing toward NNE-SSW in \nthe northern portion of the mapped \narea. This structure is related to the F\n\n2\n \n\ndeformation phase, which corresponds \nto the development of the S\n\n2\n regional \n\nschistosity and the apparent thrust of \nthe Santa B\u00e1rbara Complex over the \nMinas Supergroup.\n\nUnlike what was proposed by Dorr \n(1969), Maxwell (1972), Chemale Jr. \net al. (1991), and Ferreira F\u00ba (1999), \nthe fault kinematics seems to be essen-\n\ntially of a dextral strike-slip character \nwith a small reverse component. The \nfault trajectory shows a deflection to \nthe left relative to the bedding trace, \nthereby providing an extension of the \nlayer that results in the generation of \nan extensional megaboudin structure. \nThese mine-scale tectonics lead to the \nthinning and disappearance of the units \nfrom the Moeda and Batatal formations \nin the frontal portion of the F\u00e1brica \nNova mine pit.\n\nFolds and Folding: Geometry and Relationships\nTwo subregional-scale folds occur \n\nin the F\u00e1brica Nova region: the F\u00e1brica \nNova synform from the F\n\n4\n deformation \n\nphase and the Bento Rodrigues anticline \n(Fig. 8). In addition, a tight antiform in \nthe eastern section of the northern pit of \nthe F\u00e1brica Nova mine exists, known as \nthe Alto Pai Miguel antiform. The axial-\nplane foliations that might be geneti-\ncally associated with these folds were \nnot clearly or convincingly observed.\n\nThe F\u00e1brica Nova synform is \nan open fold a few kilometers in size, \ncharacterized by the rotation of the \nprimary structures and tectonic folia-\ntions located in the northern pit of the \nF\u00e1brica Nova mine (subdomain IIa) \nand its surroundings (Fig. 8). Only the \nstratigraphic units of the Minas Super-\n\ngroup are involved in this fold. The axis \nof this fold has a moderate plunge to \nE-SE. The western flank in the south-\nern portion has bedding attitudes of \napproximately 080/20, reaching values \nof 107/36 in the western portion of the \nnorthern pit domain and 200/60 in the \nnorthern portion. \n\nThe Bento Rodrigues anticline \nis a reclined fold a few kilometers in \nsize, composed by the gneisses of the \nSanta B\u00e1rbara Complex followed by \nthe quartzites and schists of the Sabar\u00e1 \nGroup (Fig. 8). On the eastern flank, \nwhich represents the normal strati-\ngraphic succession, the bedding and S\n\n2\n \n\nfoliation relationship shows counter-\nclockwise vorticity and \u201cS\u201d asymmetric \nfolds, whereas in the western flank, \n\nwhich has an overturned character, the \nrelationship shows clockwise vorticity \nwith \u201cZ\u201d asymmetric folds. The hinge \nof this anticline is located on the inner \nportion of the F\u00e1brica Nova synform \nhinge and bounded to the east by the \nBento Rodrigues fault.\n\nThe Alto Pai Miguel antiform is \na reverse fold of a hectometric scale \nlocated in the eastern portion of the \nF\u00e1brica Nova mine (Fig. 8). The core of \nthe structure is composed of rocks from \nthe Cercadinho Formation that outcrop \nin that area. Originally, these rocks were \ninterpreted as belonging to the Batatal \nFormation arranged by a thrust fault. \nThe correct modeling of this structure \nis of utmost importance because it will \nbe reflected in the modeling of the mine.\n\n4. Discussions and conclusions\n\nThe proposed model suggests that \nthe Santa Rita syncline is a reclined fold \nof a subregional scale, with a WNW-\nESE axial direction and roots in the \nadjacent basement of the Santa B\u00e1rbara \nComplex. The inverse flank of this syn-\ncline is bisected by the \u00c1gua Quente \nthrust fault. This fold was generated \nduring the Transamazonian event ap-\nproximately 2,125 Ma ago and consists \n\nof a reclined synclinorial fold resulting \nfrom the refolding of the normal flank \nof the Ouro Preto nappe (e.g. Almeida \n2004). The hinge zone is located in the \nCara\u00e7a region (Fig. 2) with axes that \nexhibit moderate-to-steep ESE plung-\ning. The flanks are subparallel and the \nstratigraphic units are thinner in the \noverturned flank compared with its \nnormal flank counterpart located to the \n\nwest. Schists, phyllites, and ferruginous \nquartzites belong to the Piracicaba and \nSabar\u00e1 groups are located in the core \nof the fold. The southern portion of the \ninverse flank of the Santa Rita syncline \nis sliced by a complex thrust fault system \nthat Barbosa (1968) called Ouro Fino \nnappe.

Minas, Ouro Preto, 68(2), 153-162, apr. jun. | 2015\n\nFigure 8\nA summary geological map of the \nF\u00e1brica Nova area indicating the \nposition of the axial traces of the \n\nBento Rodrigues anticline (BRA), the \nF\u00e1brica Nova synform (FNS) and the \n\nAlto Pai Miguel antiform (PMA).\n\nK inematic indicators and the \nstructural symmetry of the F\n\n4\n defor-\n\nmation phase are compatible with the \ndeformation mechanism and partition-\ning related to the flanking fold model \ndescribed and established by Passchier \n(2001) (Fig. 9). \n\nIn the case of F\u00e1brica Nova, the \ncross-cutting element to the regional \nfabric element is the crustal disconti-\nnuity that feeds the mafic rock dikes \nin the NW-SE direction present in this \nsegment of the QFe (Fig. 10). Based \non this mechanism, the structures \n\nof the F\n4\n deformation phase can be \n\nunderstood as the manifestation of \nthe deformation partitioning process \naround the major discontinuity and \nsecond-order subsidiary structures in \nresponse to the crustal shortening in \nthe EW direction.\n\nFigure 9\nA model of planar fabric deflection \n\nalong and around the zone surrounding \na cross-cutting element (CE) (Passchier \n2001). In the case of F\u00e1brica Nova, the \n\nCE is a crustal discontinuity represented \nby an ultramafic dike.\n\nW hen considering this subre-\ngional deformation mechanism using \nthe flanking fold as a model to un-\nderstand the F\u00e1brica Nova structural \nframework, the strain ratio (Rf) can be \n\nmeasured considering \ni) the angular relationship of the \n\ndirection of the layers in the short and \nlong flanks and \n\nii) the angular relationship be-\n\ntween the crustal discontinuity, the \ntransverse element direction, and the \ndirection of the short flank layers \n(Passchier 2001). The Rf value is ap-\nproximately 18.7 (Fig. 10).\n\nBrasiliano age.\nThe F\u00e1brica Nova mine is embed-\n\nded in a F\u00e1brica Nova synform structure \nwith axes oriented at 100/20. The direc-\ntion of the bedding of the units that com-\nprises the west flank behaves consistently \nand homogeneously as a homocline, \nwhich was slightly disturbed by undula-\ntions from the F\n\n3\n deformation phase. The \n\neast flank bedding, in turn, was strongly \ndisturbed by folding partially associated \n\nwith two shortening fields due to F\n3\n and \n\nF\n4\n deformation phase, respectively, in \n\nthe N-S and E-W direction. In addition, \nthe brittle tectonic structures that form \nthe sedimentary basin of the Cata Preta \nFormation (e.g. Castro et al. 1998, Lip-\nski 2002) might have contributed to the \nrotation of the basement structures.\n\nThe relationships between the \nstructures from the F\n\n4\n deformation phase \n\nare the most complex because they do \n\nnot directly respond to the regional E-W \nshortening field and are not laterally or \nregionally replicated. Cover deformation \nmechanisms induced by a basement-in-\nvolved structures can behave actively (e.g \nWilcox et al. 1973, Naylor et al. 1986, \nBrink et al. 1996, Erslev 1991, Narr &amp; \nSuppe 1994, Erslev &amp; Mayborn 1997, \nTindall 2000) or passively (e.g Passchier \n2001, Grasemann &amp; St\u00fcwe 2001, Exner \net al. 2004).\n\n\n\n160\n\nA structural model of the F\u00e1brica Nova region, Santa Rita syncline, Quadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero: flanking folds as a folding mechanism\n\nREM: R.
