The samples were taken with an Eckman-\nBirge drag, totalizing 60 for the invertebrate community, and 45 for sediment. Water \nphysicochemical variables were also measured. Environmental influences in benthic \ncommunity have been measured using a Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). \nLinear regressions were also plotted for main correlations; Results: A total of 5,535 \nspecimens were collected, identified into 18 taxa. Tanaidacea was the most abundant \nrepresenting 54% of relative abundance, followed by Diptera (23%), and Ostracoda \n(17%). The richest family was Chironomidae with 6 taxa. CCA results indicated positive \ncorrelation between Chaoborus and Stenocypris with local depth, and negative correlation \nbetween Odonata, Gastropoda, Cytheridella and Coleoptera with the finest grains of \nsediment, as well as between Tanaidacea, Lopescladius, Annelida and Nematoda with both \norganic matter (OM) content in sediment and local depth. Linear regression analysis \ndemonstrated inverse relation of Tanaidacea in response to OM (y\u00a0=\u00a0 0.6\u00a0\u2013\u00a00.62.OM) \nand sand (y\u00a0=\u00a00.6\u00a0\u2013\u00a00.6.sand), and of Lopescladius in response to OM (y\u00a0=\u00a00.37\u00a0\u2013\u00a00.41.\nOM) and sand (y\u00a0=\u00a00.37\u00a0\u2013\u00a00.46.sand). The fact that Peri lagoon has no marine influence \nand has Tanaidacea as the most abundant taxa, a group not expected in freshwaters, \ngives to this lagoon a particular relevance among coastal lagoons.

Material and Methods\n\n2.1.Study area\n\nPeri lagoon (27\u00b0\u00a044\u2019\u00a0S and 48\u00b0\u00a031\u2019\u00a0W) is located \nin the southern region of the Florian\u00f3polis island, \ncentral coast of Santa Catarina (Figure\u00a0 1). The \nlagoon\u2019s surface area of 5.7\u00a0km2 is surrounded by \nmountains covered with well preserved Atlantic \nRain Forest in the northern, western and southern \nportions, and by \u201crestinga\u201d vegetation in the eastern \nportion. The climate in the area is characteristically \nsubtropical, with rainfall well distributed along \nthe year, but concentrated in spring and summer \nmonths (October\u2013March) (Hennemann and \nPetrucio, 2010).\n\nPeri lagoon is a freshwater coastal lagoon \nwithout marine influences (freshwater all over the \nyear), making from it the main freshwater resource \nin the Florian\u00f3polis\u2019s island. A water supply network \nis working at the lagoon with mean capacity of \n200\u00a0 L/s, providing water for five districts of the \nmunicipality. Thus, almost the entire area of \nthe Peri Lagoon Watershed is situated within an \nenvironmentally protected area since 1981, with \nrestricted human occupation. \n\n2.2.Data sampling\n\nSamplings were carried out three times, \nrespectively in April, May and June 2009. Five \ndifferent sites were chosen in Peri Lagoon (Figure\u00a01). \nThe samples sites were selected considering an \nadequate representation of the different parts of the \n\n1. Introduction\n\nBenthic invertebrates are a component of aquatic \ncommunities with a large distribution and a strong \ninteraction with environmental conditions (Moretti \nand Callisto, 2005; W\u00fcrdig\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2007). They play \na key role in the nutrient cycling and energy flow \nof aquatic environments, acting in organic matter \nbreakdown process and taking effectively part in \necosystems biogeochemical cycles (Covich\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., \n1999; Strixino and Trivinho-Strixino, 2006). This \nfaunal component has been frequently used in \nenvironmental quality assessment (Guimar\u00e3es\u00a0et\u00a0al., \n2009; Mugnai\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2010).\n\nThis community shows a different distribution \nin space and time, varying in accordance with \nwater physical-chemical conditions (Pereira and \nDe\u00a0 Luca, 2003), substrate type and organic \nmatter content in sediment (Covich\u00a0et\u00a0al., 1999), \ninfluence of macrophytes (Kevrekidis, 2004), and \nlocal depth (Pamplin and Rocha, 2007). Because \nthe environmental heterogeneity, these variables \nmay differ in distinct areas of lakes, wetlands and \nstreams, determining changes in the structure and \ndistribution of benthos (W\u00fcrdig\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2007).\n\nConsidering the aquatic ecosystems in general, \nthe coastal lagoons and estuaries demonstrate \na strong interaction between benthos and the \nwater column (Bemvenuti and Rosa-Filho, 2000). \nAdditionally, these environments provide nursery \nhabitats for various species (Almeida\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2008). \nThese ecosystems are complex environments \nthat experience large fluctuations in abiotic \nvariables associated with drastic changes in the \nstructure of assemblages (Carvalho\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 2011). \nNevertheless, there is no general consensus on \nwhich environmental variables are more important \nin structuring invertebrate assemblages in these \necosystems. Many studies have shown that salinity is \nthe most important factor determining the benthic \ncommunity structure (Gamito, 2006; Pech\u00a0et\u00a0al., \n2007; Almeida\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 2008). There is, however, \na lack of studies about coastal lagoons that act as \n\nlocal. Regress\u00f5es lineares demonstraram uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o inversa de Tanaidacea em resposta \na MO (y\u00a0=\u00a00.6\u00a0\u2013\u00a00.62.MO) e areia grossa (y\u00a0=\u00a00.6\u00a0\u2013\u00a00.6.are) assim como de Lopescladius \nem rela\u00e7\u00e3o a MO (y\u00a0=\u00a00.37\u00a0\u2013\u00a00.41.MO) e areia grossa (y\u00a0=\u00a00.37\u00a0\u2013\u00a00.46.are). O fato da \nlagoa do Peri n\u00e3o ter influ\u00eancia do mar e ter Tanaidacea como t\u00e1xon mais abundante, um \ngrupo n\u00e3o esperado em ambientes de \u00e1gua doce, lhe confere destaque entre demais lagoas \ncosteiras do Brasil. Atrav\u00e9s deste estudo conclu\u00edmos que as caracter\u00edsticas de sedimento \ne profundidade local foram mais importantes que vari\u00e1veis da \u00e1gua na determina\u00e7\u00e3o da \nestrutura da comunidade de invertebradoss bent\u00f4nicos na lagoa do Peri, que variou de \nacordo com caracter\u00edsticas ambientais locais.\n\nPalavras-chave: comunidade bent\u00f4nica, riqueza e diversidade, sistema l\u00eantico.\n\n\n\n2011, vol. 23, no. 2,  p. 119-127 Aquatic invertebrate\u2019s distribution... 121\n\n2.3.Data analyses\n\nThe statistical treatment was made considering \nthe mean values of the three months together, and \nall data were log transformed prior to analyses. \nThe work was carried out using community mean \ndensities (ind.\u00a0 225\u00a0 cm\u20132) and environmental \nparameters, which were normalized using Primer \n6 Beta software. Univariate analyses of variance \n(ANOVA) were used to test for differences in \nthe environmental measured parameters of water \nand sediment, and in invertebrate community \ndensities between the sampling sites. Pearson \nCorrelation coefficients \u201cr\u201d were used to identify \nsignificant correlations between community taxa \nand environmental variables. Stepwise regressions \nwere used to illustrate the response of main \ncommunity taxa to their main environmental \nvariables. The relationship between environmental \nvariables and invertebrate community structure was \nexplored by means of a Canonical Correspondence \nAnalysis (CCA) biplot distribution, tested with \nMont Carlo significance levels, using Canoco for \nWindows 4.5 software. ANOVA, Pearson\u2019s \u201cr\u201d, and \nlinear regressions were calculated using Statistica 7 \nsoftware.\n\n3. Results\n\nThe summary of environmental variables values \nof water and sediment measured in the five sampling \nsites is presented in Table\u00a01. Depth was higher in P1, \nwith a maximum of 9\u00a0m in April, and it achieved \n\nlagoon, ranging the northern (P5), central (P1) and \nsouthern (P3) regions, and describing deep (P1) and \nshallow (P4) areas, both in a mouth of rivers (P2 \nand P3) or in other areas (P5, P4, P1) (Figure\u00a01).\n\nIn each sampling site four samples using \nan Ekman-Birge grab (15\u00a0 \u00d715\u00a0 cm) were taken \nfor invertebrate analyses, and three samples for \nsediment analyses (mean grain size and percentage \nof organic matter), totalizing 105 samples in the \nstudied period. The samples were washed under \nrunning water using 250\u00a0\u00b5m mesh sieves, and all \ninvertebrates retained were sorted, counted and \npreserved in 70% ethanol. The aquatic fauna were \nsorted under stereo microscope and identified to the \nlowest possible taxonomic level using identification \nkeys by Fern\u00e1ndez and Dom\u00ednguez (2001) and \nMugnai\u00a0et\u00a0al. (2010). The organisms belonging to \nthe Chironomidae family were mounted on semi-\npermanent slides and subsequently identified under \nstereomicroscope, according to Trivinho-Strixino \nand Strixino (1995).\n\nWater was collected in Sechis disc depth for \nanalyses. The water temperature (\u00b0C), conductivity \n(\u00b5S.cm\u20131), pH and dissolved oxygen (mg.L\u20131) \nwere measured in situ at each sampling station \nwith the specific probe WTW-Multi\u00a0 350i. Local \ndepth (m) was also measured. The granulometric \ncomposition of the sediment was determined by \nsieving in laboratory, and grain size was classified \ninto 3 size classes according to the granulometric \nscale of Suguio (1973). Organic matter content was \ndetermined by ignition (7\u00a0g of sediment burnt at \n550\u00a0\u00b0C during 4\u00a0hours).\n\nFigure 1. The map of the sampling sites in Peri lagoon (27\u00b0\u00a044\u2019\u00a0S and 48\u00b0\u00a031\u2019\u00a0W), southern region of Florian\u00f3polis \nIsland (Santa Catarina, Brazil).\n\n\n\n122 Lisboa, LK., Silva, ALL. and Petrucio, MM. Acta Limnologica Brasiliensia\n\namong the sampling sites (F\u00a0 =\u00a0 5.16, p\u00a0 =\u00a0 0.03). \nTotal abundance and species richness between the \nfive sampling sites ranged from 201 individuals \nin P5 and 9 taxa in P3 to 4,131 individuals and \n14 taxa in P4. In the central site (P1) Ostracoda \npredominated with the highest abundance, followed \nby Chaoborus. In the two southern sites (P2 and \nP3) Chironomus predominated followed by the \nostracode Cytheridella\u00a0ilosvayi Daday, 1905. In site \nP4 Tanaidacea was the predominant taxa, and in \nthe northern site (P5) Chironomus and Coelotanypus \npredominated.\n\nTanaidacea densities found in Peri lagoon were \nextremely high in P4, reaching more than 10,000 \nindividuals per\u00a0 m\u20132, despite the low densities \nobserved in others sites. C.\u00a0ilosvayi was also present \nin high density in P3, reaching 1,818.5\u00a0 ind.m\u20132, \nand the quironomid Lopescladius presented a density \nof 1,655.5\u00a0ind.m\u20132 also in P4. The lowest density \namong sample sites were observed in P5 with \n744.4\u00a0 ind.m\u20132, and the highest one was observed \nin P4, which presented 15,300\u00a0ind.m\u20132.\n\nAccording to the CCA between the mean \nenvironmental variables and community densities \nof the five different sampling sites, the main \nenvironmental variables that determined the \ncommunity structure were organic matter content \nin sediment, coarse grains and water depth (Table\u00a03). \nThe first two components of CCA explained 61.4% \nof total community variability (Figure\u00a02). The first \naxis accounted with 36.1% (Monte Carlo test \np-value\u00a0 =\u00a0 0.002) and the second accounted with \nothers 25.3% (Monte Carlo significances test of all \ncanonical axes p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.03). \n\nIn accordance with CCA analysis, it was possible \nto observe that Chaoborus and Stenocypris\u00a0 major \nBaird, 1859 were positively correlated with water \ndepth. In the other hand, Annelida and Tanaidacea \nwere negatively correlated with this variable, and \nthey also showed to be negatively correlated with \n\nthe minimum value in P4 with 1.3\u00a0m, measured in \nthe same month. \n\nWater variables (pH, dissolved oxygen, \ntemperature and conductivity) did not show \nsignificant differences between the sampling sites \n(F\u00a0=\u00a00.5, p\u00a0=\u00a00.91). Water temperature showed a \ndecreasing tendency along the sampling months due \nto the subtropical climate. Oxygen concentrations \nhave presented an inverse tendency to water \ntemperature, in which the concentrations increased \nwith the decrease of the last.\n\nThe organic matter percentages in sediment \nwere higher in P2 and P1 (35.12 and 30.34%), and \nsmaller in P4 and P5 (3.45 and 3.84%). Sediment \nof Peri lagoon was quite heterogeneous in relation \nto the granulometric composition, with mean \nvalues of sand ranging from 3.59% in site P4 to \n32.22% in site P2, and mean values of silt ranging \nfrom 44.23% in site P2 to 78.76% in site P4 \n(Table\u00a01). ANOVA showed significant differences \nof granulometric composition and organic matter \ncontents in sediment among the sampling sites \n(F\u00a0=\u00a02.89, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01).\n\nThe aquatic invertebrate community was \ndescribed on the basis of mean densities (ind.m\u20132), \ntaxonomic richness and relative abundance \n(Table\u00a02). A total of 5,535 specimens of fauna were \ncollected in the sediment, distributed in 18 taxa \nand 6 classes. Chironomidae was the more diverse \ntaxa, presenting 6 genus (Table\u00a02). Crustacea was \nthe numerically dominant taxa, representing more \nthan 70% of the community, where the group \nTanaidacea showed 54.2% of these amount, and \nOstracoda 17.4%. The second most abundant group \nwas Diptera, representing more than 23% of the \nrelative abundance, mainly with the genus of the \nChironomidae Lopescladius (8.3%), Chironomus \n(6.7%) and Coelotanypus (4.6%).\n\nInvertebrate community composition and \nabundance in Peri lagoon varied significantly \n\nTable 1.

In fact, \nstudies on lentic ecosystems came to the conclusion \nthat environmental factors such as organic matter \ncontent in sediment (W\u00fcrdig\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 1998; \nCartier\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2010) and grain sizes (Cenzano and \nW\u00fcrdig, 2006; W\u00fcrdig\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2007) are considered \nexplanatory variables for density and distribution \nof benthic community. In the other hand, size and \nhabitat structure seems to play an important role \non invertebrate community composition (Heino, \n2000), and even water temperature and influence \nof macrophytes could have a key role structuring \nthis community (Kevrekidis, 2004).\n\np\u00a0 =\u00a0 0.007) with negative correlation. We found \nevidence that the percentage of sand in sediment is \nalso determinant for the variation of these group, \nshowing a direct negative relation with tanaids \ndensity (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.42, p\u00a0=\u00a00.009). The most abundant \n\nFigure 2.

The low dominance of \nAnnelida (3% of the relative abundance), compared \nwith the findings of Cenzano and W\u00fcrdig (2006) \nand W\u00fcrdig\u00a0 et\u00a0 al. (2007) in other Brazilians \ncoastal lagoons, may attest the good quality of the \nlagoon ecosystem. Hypothetically, it could also \nbe considered if the low dominance of Annelida \npresents a correlation to oligotrophic for nutrients \nconcentrations, as shown by Hennemann and \nPetrucio (2010). \n\nEvident correlation between Chaoborus and \nwater depth observed in this study has been \nestablished in many others studies of lentic \nenvironments (Arcifa, 2000; Bezerra-Neto and \nPinto-Coelho, 2002; Pamplin and Rocha, 2007), \nand could be explained by the natural behavior \nof this group (Bezerra-Neto and Pinto-Coelho, \n2002). Nevertheless, it was Stenocypris major that \nshowed the strongest correlation with water depth, \nand studies about this interaction are infrequent. \nOligochaeta was negatively correlated with water \ndepth, what was already observed by Pamplim and \nRocha (2007), and may be explained by a better \nadaptation of these group in the site with the \ngreatest density of organisms.\n\nThe direct negative relationship of Tanaidacea \nand Lopescladius, respectively the first and the third \nmost important components of benthos densities, \nwith OM and sand content in sediment, suggests \nthat an organic enrichment in this system could \npromote drastic changes in the composition and \nabundances of aquatic invertebrate community in \nthe entire lagoon. Nevertheless, few studies with \nthese groups were performed in Brazilian freshwater \nsystems, and their real importance is still by far \nunknown.\n\nThe present study intended solely to correlate \nthe aquatic invertebrate community with water \nand sediment\u2019s characteristics of the lagoon. Many \nother variables play also a role in the community \nstructure, such as influence of macrophytes \n(Kevrekidis, 2004; Albertoni\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2007), predation \nintensity (Marques\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 1999), habitat stability \n(Herbst and Bromley, 1984), water renewal regimes \n(Gamito, 2006) and temporal and spatial dynamics \n(Carvalho\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2011). A biogeographycal multi-\nscale approach could also be taken into account \n(Ricklefs and Schulter, 1993).\n\nEven with the great importance of invertebrates \nin nutrient\u2019s cycling and ecological successional \nprocess of aquatic ecosystems, few studies have \nbeen made with these organisms in freshwater \ncoastal lagoons. Despite the punctual empirical \n\nIn coastal lagoons, however, many studies \nshow that salinity is a key factor in regulating \nbenthic community, assigning secondary role to \nsediment granulometric composition and organic \nmatter content (Gamito, 2006; Pech\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2007; \nAlmeida\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 2008). Notwithstanding, Peri \nlagoon is situated among the infrequent coastal \nlagoons with no marine influence, besides its \nproximity to the Atlantic Ocean. The presence \nof Tanaidacea is a fact that corroborates this \nambiguity of influences. According to Jaume and \nBoxshall (2008), tanaids are essentially marines, and \nworldwide represented in freshwater systems only \nwith four species. In addition, in South America \noccurs only one species (Jaume and Boxshall, \n2008). These observations make from Peri lagoon a \nconspicuous case. Being one of the first studies ever \nmade on benthic communities to the Peri lagoon, \nwe were able to demonstrate a presence of more \nthan 50% of the relative abundance composed by \ntanaids. This dominance of crustaceans was already \nobserved in other Brazilian coastal lagoons, being \nalso tanaids one of the most abundant groups in \nTaim Hydrological System (W\u00fcrdig\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2007). \nAccording to W\u00fcrdig\u00a0 et\u00a0 al. (2007), a historical \nprocess of ecological and large temporal scale \nexplains the presence of these taxa in these systems. \nIn addition, Covich\u00a0 et\u00a0 al. (1999) have shown \nthat crustaceans play important roles in aquatic \necosystems, mainly on detritivorous food web.\n\nThe water supply network located in Peri lagoon \nmust ensure a good water quality without salinity, \nmaking from this coastal lagoon also a reservoir \nwith a constructed barrier to control the water \nlevel. In spite of this consideration, we argue that \nPeri lagoon differs from other man-made reservoirs, \nthat have the water level flow and regime controlled \naccording to human necessities and are dominated \nby Oligochaeta and Diptera (Pamplin\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2006; \nPamplin and Rocha, 2007). Peri lagoon has most of \nits dynamics governed by nature, and a community \nthat is closer related to those of others coastal lagoons \n(W\u00fcrdig\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2007). Working with semi-natural \ncoastal lagoons in Southern Portugal, Gamito \n(2006) found a similar community characteristic \nof estuarine and shallow-water habitats, but in this \ncase dominated by mollusks and Chironomidae. In \nthe same direction, Kevrekidis (2004) observed low \nsalinities Mediterranean coastal lagoons dominated \nby mollusks and amphipods.\n\nThe highest zoobenthos abundance in Peri \nlagoon was observed at the shallowest sites, in \naccordance with Cenzano and W\u00fcrdig (2006) \n\n\n\n126 Lisboa, LK., Silva, ALL. and Petrucio, MM.
