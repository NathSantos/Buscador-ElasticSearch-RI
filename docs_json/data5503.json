Os perfis formam aproximadamente uma figura com a forma de um \n\ntrapezoide is\u00f3sceles possuindo uma mediana em torno de 100 m. Foi analisado um total \n\nde 21 amostras a partir dos perfis. A camada de bentonita na \u00e1rea estudada varia de 5 a \n\n6 metros de espessura e no perfil localiza-se entre a camada de solo do topo e uma \n\ncamada sotoposta de arenito de granula\u00e7\u00e3o media a grossa. A composi\u00e7\u00e3o mineral\u00f3gica \n\nobservada em rocha total ao XRD mostra um aumento do conte\u00fado de esmectita com a \n\nprofundidade, estimando-se uma propor\u00e7\u00e3o de 30% a 50% na profundidade de 1,5m e \n\nde 90 a 96% na profundidade de 7 a 8,3 m, variando muito pouco de um perfil em \n\nrela\u00e7\u00e3o a outro, por\u00e9m, mantendo a tend\u00eancia de aumento da esmectita em \n\nprofundidade. Identifica-se montmorilonitas dioctaedricas magnesianas com predom\u00ednio \n\nde Ca na posi\u00e7\u00e3o troc\u00e1vel, seguido de quartzo, feldspatos (albita e K-fel\u00e7dspato) e \n\nraramente identifica-se tra\u00e7os de ilita e zeolitas (heulandita-clinoptilolita). A \n\ncomposi\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica por XRF tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 coerente com a tend\u00eancia observada na \n\nmineralogia, com uma diminui\u00e7\u00e3o em profundidade do teor de SiO2, K2O, Na2O \n\nindicativo de menos quartzo e feldspato e um aumento do MgO oriundo das \n\nsubstitui\u00e7\u00f5es octa\u00e9dricas da esmectita que tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 respons\u00e1vel pela origem da carga \n\ninterfoliar, Al2O3 da posi\u00e7\u00e3o octa\u00e9drica das esmectitas, Fe2O3 supostamente octa\u00e9drico e \n\nCaO que entra no sistema para compensar o desequil\u00edbrio el\u00e9trico das cargas.  \n\nA carga interfoliar foi estimada na fra\u00e7\u00e3o&lt;1 ?m por dois m\u00e9todos sendo \n\nque a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o espacial mostra uma tend\u00eancia de aumentar na parte intermedi\u00e1ria da \n\ncamada com valores em torno de 0,56 e/huc, diminuindo em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao topo e em \n\nprofundidade com valores variando entre 0,46 a 0,48 e/huc. Esta varia\u00e7\u00e3o gradual \u00e9 \n\nmelhor observada nos difratogramas do que atrav\u00e9s do m\u00e9todo de c\u00e1lculo da carga \n\ninterfoliar, que n\u00e3o possuem sensibilidade suficiente para identificar as pequenas \n\nvaria\u00e7\u00f5es. Entretanto, varia\u00e7\u00f5es na posi\u00e7\u00e3o e na forma do pico 001 da esmectita s\u00e3o \n\nevidencias significativas que permitem validar as conclus\u00f5es. O c\u00e1lculo da formula \n\nunit\u00e1ria da montmorilonita mostra uma carga interfoliar de origem octa\u00e9drica com uma \n\ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o heterogenia ao longo do perfil refor\u00e7ada pela varia\u00e7\u00e3o na sor\u00e7\u00e3o \n\norganof\u00edlica e no grau de expans\u00e3o observado na montmorilonita.  \n\n\n\niv \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nA avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da capacidade de troca de c\u00e1tions (CEC) utilizada no projeto \n\nfoi validada com o m\u00e9todo do acetado de am\u00f4nio, sendo que os valores obtidos foram \n\ndiretamente proporcionais a estimativa da carga interfoliar das amostras. Valores de \n\nCEC entre 110 moles/100gr de argila corresponde a uma carga interfoliar da ordem de \n\n0,55 e/huc e valores em torno de 90 moles/100gr de argila correspondem a cargas \n\ninterfoliares em torno de 0,46 e/huc. A quantidade de cloreto de dodecylammonium \n\n(C12H28CIN) utilisado para organofiliza\u00e7\u00e3o foi proporcional a media do CEC. Em \n\nrela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s propriedades f\u00edsicas e organofiliza\u00e7\u00e3o, os padr\u00f5es dos difratogramas das \n\nargilas organofilicas mostraram uma tend\u00eancia de expansibilidade em fun\u00e7\u00e3o da carga \n\ninterfoliar e a posi\u00e7\u00e3o do pico 001 da montmorilonita-(C12H28CIN) que variou de \n\n17,05\u00c5 a 17,68\u00c5. Pode-se considerar como um complexo bicamadas organo argilas, \n\nclassicamente esperadas a 17,46\u00c5 considerando o tamanho da cadeia alkyl utilizada e a \n\nisoterma de sor\u00e7\u00e3o conhecida. As pequenas varia\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o indicativas da presen\u00e7a de \n\ncamadas n\u00e3o intercaladas devido a heterogeneidade da carga. Embora as pequenas \n\ndiferen\u00e7as no espa\u00e7amento \u201cd\u201d entre as amostras, a rela\u00e7\u00e3o da 001 argila organofilica do \n\nperfil em fun\u00e7\u00e3o da carga interfoliar, apresentou uma correla\u00e7\u00e3o perfeita. Comparando \n\nno perfil, o espa\u00e7amento 001 da argila org\u00e2nica tende a aumentar com a carga intefoliar. \n\nA posi\u00e7\u00e3o do pico 001 varia entre 17,15\u00c5 e 17,5\u00c5 e a \u00e1rea do pico 001 ap\u00f3s a \n\norganofiliza\u00e7\u00e3o variou entre 2620,6 (cps x deg) at\u00e9 418,8 (cps x deg). \n\nA tend\u00eancia observada para a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o espacial da carga interfoliar \n\nesta provavelmente relacionada com uma varia\u00e7\u00e3o gradual da permeabilidade e da raz\u00e3o \n\n\u00e1gua/rocha durante a altera\u00e7\u00e3o. A zona media da camada que concentra os mais \n\nelevados valores de carga interfoliar mostrou frequentemente a presen\u00e7a de uma textura \n\nesferul\u00edtica. Tamb\u00e9m, tra\u00e7os de zeolitas no XRD foram encontrados somente em \n\namostras da profundidade entre 4 e 6 metros, indicando que a raz\u00e3o \u00e1gua/rocha estava \n\nno limiar do campo de estabilidade onde as zeolitas s\u00e3o favorecidas em detrimento das \n\nesmectitas no processo altera\u00e7\u00e3o do vidro vulc\u00e2nico. \n\nPalavras-chave: Bentonita, montmorilonita, carga interfoliar, organofiliza\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nv \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nAbstract: \n\n \n\nTo model the spatial distribution of key smectite properties, four profiles \n\nwere sampled, two coming from boreholes and 2 from fresh cut samples over the \n\nmining front, Forming roughly an Isosceles Trapezoid with a median of approximately \n\n100 m; 21 samples were analyzed over the four profiles. Bentonite bed ranges in the \n\nstudied area from 5 to 6 m thick underlying top soil layer and overlaying a gross grain \n\nsandstone layer. Mineralogical composition observed on whole rock XRD traces \n\nshowed an increasing content of the smectitic phase as a function of depth, going from \n\n30% to 50% at around 1,5 m depth to 90 to 96 % at  a depth ranging 7 to 8,3 m depth, \n\nvarying very slightly from one profile to another but keeping the trend. Mayor mineral \n\nphases identified were Mg rich dioctahedral montmorillonite with mainly Ca in \n\nexchangeable position, Quartz,   feldspar (Albite and K-feldspar) and only occasionally \n\nas trace phases we observed Illite and Zeolites (heulandite-clinoptilolite). XRF chemical \n\nanalysis results are also coherent with this vertical tendencies, expressed in a notable \n\ndecrease of a  SiO2, K2O, Na2O indicating less quartz and feldspar species; and with \n\nincreasing of MgO as octahedral substitution representing the main source of layer \n\ncharge, Al2O3 most octahedral but also in a rather small amount as tetrahedral \n\nsubstitutions, Fe2O3   presumably octahedral and CaO compensating electrical charge \n\ndesequilibrium. \n\nLayer charge was estimated on the&lt;1 ?m size fraction by two methods \n\nand spatial distribution shows a clear trend to increase at the middle of the bed up to \n\nvalues around 0,56 e/huc and decrease towards top and bottom over values ranging \n\nfrom 0.46 to 0,48 e/huc. This gradual variations can be better observed on the XRD \n\npatters than by actual layer charge calculation methods results, given the fact that for \n\nthis slight variances, commonly used methods are not sensible enough, Nevertheless the \n\n001 peak position and shape of the smectite phase represents sufficient  evidence for \n\nconclusions. Layer charge distribution is mainly Octahedral derived from unit formula \n\ncalculations and Layer charge is clearly heterogeneous due to Organophilic sorption and \n\nswelling behavior observed.  \n\n\n\nvi \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nCation exchange capacity was calculated by ammonium acetate method, \n\nvalues obtained are directly proportional to layer charge estimations over those samples.  \n\nCEC values around 110 moles/100gr of clay correspond to Layer charge on the order of  \n\n0,55 e/huc and  values around 90 moles/100gr of clay  to layer charges around 0,46 \n\ne/huc. The amount of dodecylammonium Chloride (C12H28CIN) used for \n\norganophilization was established proportional to the CEC average. Regarding the \n\nimplications on physical properties and organophilization, XRD patterns of \n\nOrganophilic clays showed a tendency on expandability as a function of layer charge in \n\nterms of their 001 (C12H28CIN)-Montmorillonite peak position, ranging from 17,05 \u00c5 \n\nTo 17,68 \u00c5. They could all be considered as bilayer intercalated Organoclay complexes, \n\nclassically expected at 17,46 \u00c5 according size of the alkyl chain used, and the known \n\nsorption isotherm. The slight variances are indicating the presence of non-intercalated \n\nsheets due to charge heterogeneity. Despite the slight d-spacing differences among \n\nsamples, the relationship 001 Organophilic C profile as a function of layer charge has a  \n\nperfect correlation. Comparing a single profile,  001 d-spacing of organoclays tends to \n\nincrease with increasing layer charge. The position of the 001 peak ranges between \n\n17.15 \u00c5 and 17.5 \u00c5 and the raw 001 peak area after organophilization can vary from \n\n2620.6(cps x deg)  to  418.8 (cps x deg).  \n\nThe tendencies observed for layer charge spatial distribution are probably \n\nrelated to gradual variations of permeability and water/rock ratio during alteration,  the \n\nmiddle zone of the bed that concentrates higher values of layer charge also has showed \n\nvery frequent  presence of spherulitic textures that may belonged originally of opal-CT \n\nbut replaced by recrystallized quartz unlike top and bottom of the bed, also  Zeolites \n\nXRD traces were only found in samples located from 4 to 6 m depth,  indicating that \n\nwater rock ratio close to the threshold where Zeolites are favored with respect to \n\nsmectites as a product of alteration. \n\nKeywords: Bentonite, montmorilonite, layer charge, organophilization \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nvii \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nSum\u00e1rio \nAgradecimentos: ....................................................................................... ii \n\nResumo: ................................................................................................... iii \n\nAbstract: .................................................................................................... v \n\n1 -

Em especial quando a intera\u00e7\u00e3o esta relacionada com a troca dos c\u00e1tions \n\nintercamadas das esmectitas naturais, sendo este o caso em v\u00e1rias aplica\u00e7\u00f5es industriais, \n\nmedicas e ambientais. \n\nInteressante o fato que mesmo sendo a carga interfoliar reconhecida \n\ncomo uma, se n\u00e3o a mais importante propriedade da fam\u00edlia das esmectitas e \n\nfundamental para a compreens\u00e3o da capacidade de intera\u00e7\u00e3o destes minerais, ainda \n\nexiste uma lacuna no conhecimento da sua distribui\u00e7\u00e3o nas ocorr\u00eancias de bentonita, da \n\ninfluencia dos processos diagen\u00e9ticos e sobre os m\u00e9todos apropriados para sua \n\nestimativa. \n\nO dep\u00f3sito de bentonta de Melo, norte do Uruguai, tem sido descrito \n\ncomo praticamente uma argila monomineralica formada por esmectita c\u00e1lcica \n\ndioctaedrica origin\u00e1ria da altera\u00e7\u00e3o de cinza vulc\u00e2nica riol\u00edtica, depositada em ambiente \n\ntransicional lagunar durante o Permiano Superior. O contexto geol\u00f3gico dos estratos \n\nque contem a bentonita, associado a bacia sedimentar intracrat\u00f4nica do Paran\u00e1 \n\npermitiram preservar a esmectita, que n\u00e3o apresenta sinais de ilitiza\u00e7\u00e3o apesar da idade.. \n\nPor outro lado a preserva\u00e7\u00e3o da esmectita no tempo geol\u00f3gico transforma esta bentonita \n\nnuma importante fonte para pesquisas no campo dos processos diagen\u00e9ticos e tamb\u00e9m \n\nsobre a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o espacial das propriedades qu\u00edmicas e f\u00edsicas. \n\nAs implica\u00e7\u00f5es industriais do conhecimento das varia\u00e7\u00f5es da carga \n\ninterfoliar \u00e9 explorado neste projeto visando a organofiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de um conjunto de \n\namostras selecionadas pelo crit\u00e9rio da varia\u00e7\u00e3o da carga interfoliar. Os resultados \n\nproduziram informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre as rela\u00e7\u00f5es entre a varia\u00e7\u00e3o espacial da carga interfoliar e \n\nas propriedades de sor\u00e7\u00e3o das montmorilonitas. \n\nO projeto atual foi desenvolvido como uma pesquisa em conjunto entre a \n\nUniversidade T\u00e9cnica de Creta e a Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, sob a \n\n\n\n2 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nsupervis\u00e3o de George Christidis (TUC) e Prof. Norberto Dani (UFRGS).

Desenvolveu-se a partir da altera\u00e7\u00e3o de cinzas vulc\u00e2nicas depositadas num \n\nambiente transicional lagunar. Pertence estratigraficamente a Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Rio do Rastro \n\nno Permiano Superior (equivalente a Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Yaguari no Uruguai, Andreis et al. \n\n1996, Rocha-Campos et al. 2010). Embora sendo uma ocorr\u00eancia do Permiano, \n\nmanteve-se preservada devido ao contexto geol\u00f3gico especial ligado a Bacia \n\nIntracrat\u00f4nica do Paran\u00e1 e localmente devido a um grupo de falhas que protegeram \n\ncamadas relativamente pouco espessas de bentonita da eros\u00e3o. Representam uma \n\nimportante fonte de informa\u00e7\u00e3o para estudos envolvendo processo diageneticos e no \n\nestudo da varia\u00e7\u00e3o de propriedades f\u00edsicas e qu\u00edmicas em fun\u00e7\u00e3o da sua distribui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nespacial.  \n\nA camada de bentonita de Ba\u00f1ado de Medina tem sido correlacionada \n\ncom \u00e1rea fonte vulc\u00e2nica de composi\u00e7\u00e3o riol\u00edtica (Coutinho et al. 1981. 1991). A \n\nposs\u00edvel fonte vulc\u00e2nica estaria localizada no sudoeste da Argentina. Formoso et al \n\n(1998)  datou as camadas como Permiano Inferior a M\u00e9dio. Caralge et al (2001) e \n\nMeunier et al (2005) correlacionam Ba\u00f1ado de Medina com as ocorr\u00eancias de bontonita \n\nem Acegu\u00e1, sul do Brasil, baseado em similaridades mineral\u00f3gicas e na assinatura \n\nqu\u00edmica de minerais pesados e elementos terras raras (REE). Sugerem que a varia\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndos elementos maiores, RRE e abundancia dos elementos menores na camada de argila \n\nindicam dois eventos sucessivos de queda de cinzas vulc\u00e2nicas. O teor dos elementos \n\ntra\u00e7os indicam um vidro vulc\u00e2nico fracionado derivado de magmas riol\u00edticos \n\nproduzidos numa contexto geol\u00f3gico de subduc\u00e7\u00e3o/colis\u00e3o. \n\nCom rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 fonte vulc\u00e2nica, Rocha-Campos et al (2009) consideram \n\nque a prov\u00edncia \u00edgnea de Choiyoi do bloco S\u00e3o Rafael, localizado no oeste da Argentina \n\n(Patag\u00f4nia) poderia ser considerada como a \u00e1rea fonte do vulcanismo durante o \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nPermiano. A figura 03 mostra a influencia geogr\u00e1fica deste vulcanismo. Embora Melo \n\npossui uma idade permiana, a atividade vulc\u00e2nica do norte da Patag\u00f4nia atingiu seu pico \n\nno Tri\u00e1ssico e no Jur\u00e1ssico Inferior (Andreis et al, 1996), sendo eventos mais explosivos \n\ndevido a natureza felsica dos magmas (Axelrod, 1985). \n\n \n\n \nFigura 3 \u2013 C\u00edrculos com raios de 1000 e 2000 km centrados na \u00e1rea de S\u00e3o Rafael \ne nordeste da prov\u00edncia \u00edgnea Choyoi; Mapa base: distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de cinza vulc\u00e2nica \ndurante a erup\u00e7\u00e3o de Quiza Pu em 1932 (Hiltrech and Drake, 1992).

As erup\u00e7\u00f5es exemplificariam a dispers\u00e3o \nda cinza vulc\u00e2nica que cobriria distancias compar\u00e1veis com aquelas do Vulcanismo  \nChoiyoi. (Rocha-Campos et al., 2009) \n\n \n\n2.4 \u2013 Justificativas para a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o da pesquisa \n\nA justificativa do projeto salientado anteriormente relaciona-se com a \n\nimport\u00e2ncia da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o espacial da carga interfoliar e suas implica\u00e7\u00f5es na \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nindustrializa\u00e7\u00e3o da bentonita. Entretanto outros aspectos da investiga\u00e7\u00e3o devem ser \n\nmencionados: \n\n1. Atualmente a pequena ocorrencia de Ba\u00f1ado de Medina esta explorado com metodos de \nescava\u00e7\u00e3o a c\u00e9u aberto sem crit\u00e9rios de mistura ou de homogeneiza\u00e7\u00e3o das diferentes \nfrentes. Cerca de 30% a 35% dos 9 m ou 7 m de um perfil tipico \u00e9 descartado. Somente as \nse\u00e7\u00f5es com elevada propor\u00e7\u00e3o de esmectita s\u00e3o exploradas. A XRD mostra que em \nprofundidades de 1,5 m \u2013 2,2 m a partir da cobertura de solotem um conteudo \nsiginificativo de montmorilonita dioctaedrica em propor\u00e7\u00f5es que podem variar entre \n25% a 60%. Isto fica exemplificado nos perfis F1, C e F2. De acordo com o uso final a \nmistura de materiais com diferentes propor\u00e7\u00f5es de montmorilonita pode ser \nconveniente no sentido de extender as reservas e a vida util da ocorr\u00eancia. \n\n2. Os resultados da pesquisa podem servir como criterios de prospec\u00e7\u00e3o, considerando que \na fonte vulcanica da bentonta esta localizada na Patagonia e foi ativa at\u00e9 o Jur\u00e1sico \nSuperior. A dist\u00e2ncia a partir da \u00e1rea fonte permite pensar na possibilidade de se \nencontrar ocorrencias similares com interesse economico numa ampla \u00e1rea. Camadas \nsimilares, embora com espessuras pequenas foram encontradas no sul do Brasil. O \nentendimento das condi\u00e7\u00f5es diageneticas da ocorr\u00eancia e as vari\u00e1veis de preserva\u00e7\u00e3o \npode estabelecer parametros para prever outras ocurrencias. O entendimento de como a \ncarga interfoliar do dep\u00f3sito vvaria e como afeta as propriedades f\u00edsica, ser\u00e1 possivel \npredizer a qualidade outras ocorr\u00eancias em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao processo diagenetico identificado. \n\n3. A estimativa da carga interfoliar ser\u00e1 feita por dois metodos diferentes (Christidis E. G. et \nal,. 2003), ser\u00e1 possivel comparar os resultados em amostras com diferentes cargas \nintefoliares e proximo a margem de erro dos metodos. \n\n3 \u2013 Resultados e conclus\u00f5es \n\nA carga interfoliar da esmectita na ocorrencia de Ba\u00f1ado de Medina \n\ntende a ser maior nas por\u00e7oes centrais da camada de bentonita. Para a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nindustrial da bentonita \u00e9 importante o entendimento das substitui\u00e7oes octa\u00e9dricas e \n\ntetra\u00e9dricas na estrutura das escmectitas que ir\u00e3o se refletir nas propriedades no \n\ncontexto das aplica\u00e7\u00f5es.  \n\nObservou-se uma correla\u00e7\u00e3o entre o padr\u00e3o dos difratogramas das \n\norganoargilas (C12H28CIN)-montmorilonita com os valores da carga interfoliar. O \n\nespa\u00e7amento do pico 001 organoargila tende a aumentar com o aumento da carga \n\ninterfoliar.

This implies that it may \nconstitute one of the oldest exploited bentonite deposit known and yet it\u2019s been kept \nunder remarkably well preserved conditions without any signs of illitization. This rare \ncharacteristic is perhaps specially related to the geological context linked to an \nintracratonic basin (Paran\u00e1 Basin). Therefore it represents an outstanding source for \nacademic research to gain additional knowledge about the digenetic process itself and \nalso the way physical and chemical properties can be spatially distributed. \n\n \n\nTo achieve a complete perspective of the implications that a rational layer charge \nvariation could have upon industrial uses of bentonites, the present research project also \nevaluates organophilization over a set of samples selected by layer charge variance \ncriteria. These results will provide enough information about the actual layer charge \nspatial variations on the sorption properties of montmorillonite.  \n\n \n\nThe present project has been developed as a Joint research between the Technical \nUniversity of Crete and Universidade Federal de Rio Grade do Sul, under the supervision \nof George Christidis (TUC) and Prof Norberto Dani (UFRGS), As a master thesis to for \nthe Erasmus Mundus Program \u201cInternational Master in Advanced Clay Science\u201d and with \nthe financial support of the Clay Mineral Society (CMS) \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n1.2 - Abstract \n \n\nThe Choiyoi igneous province from San Rafael block located in central Western \nArgentina (Patagonia) should be considered as source for rhyolitic ash fall deposits \nduring the earlier to mid Permian at the south section of the Parana Basin, in this context, \nthe bentonite bed at Ba\u00f1ado de Medina, located 20 Km from Melo, Northern Uruguay is \nan outstandingly well preserved stratiform bed considering the age of deposition. It may \nconstitute one of the oldest known bentonite deposit without signs of illitization and \nhaving economic potential. It derived from an early alteration in a lagoon to transitional \nenvironment, and it was protected from diagenesis due to the special geological situation \nlinked to a intracratonic basin, presenting evidence of burial with a compact appearance \nbut low diagenetic conditions, more locally it was probably conserved from erosion due to \na series of faults also evident in field. \nTo model the spatial distribution of key smectite properties, four profiles were sampled, \ntwo coming from boreholes and 2 from fresh cut samples over the mining front, Forming \nroughly an Isosceles Trapezoid with a median of approximately 100 m; 21 samples were \nanalyzed over the four profiles. Bentonite bed ranges in the studied area from 5 to 6 m \nthick underlying top soil layer and overlaying a gross grain sandstone layer. Mineralogical \ncomposition observed on whole rock XRD traces showed an increasing content of the \nsmectitic phase as a function of depth, going from 30% to 50% at around 1,5 m depth to \n90 to 96 % at  a depth ranging 7 to 8,3 m depth, varying very slightly from one profile to \nanother but keeping the trend. Mayor mineral phases identified were Mg rich dioctahedral \nmontmorillonite with mainly Ca in exchangeable position, Quartz,   feldspar (Albite and K-\nfeldspar) and only occasionally as trace phases we observed Illite and Zeolites \n(heulandite-clinoptilolite). XRF chemical analysis results are also coherent with this \nvertical tendencies, expressed in a notable decrease of a  SiO2, K2O, Na2O indicating \nless quartz and feldspar species; and with increasing of MgO as octahedral substitution \nrepresenting the main source of layer charge, Al2O3 most octahedral but also in a rather \nsmall amount as tetrahedral substitutions, Fe2O3   presumably octahedral and CaO \ncompensating electrical charge desequilibrium. \nLayer charge was estimated on the&lt;1 ?m size fraction by two methods and spatial \ndistribution shows a clear trend to increase at the middle of the bed up to values around \n0,56 e/huc and decrease towards top and bottom over values ranging from 0.46 to 0,48 \ne/huc. This gradual variations can be better observed on the XRD patters than by actual \nlayer charge calculation methods results, given the fact that for this slight variances, \ncommonly used methods are not sensible enough, Nevertheless the 001 peak position \nand shape of the smectite phase represents sufficient  evidence for conclusions. Layer \ncharge distribution is mainly Octahedral derived from unit formula calculations and Layer \ncharge is clearly heterogeneous due to Organophilic sorption and swelling behavior \nobserved.  \nCation exchange capacity was calculated by ammonium acetate method, values \nobtained are directly proportional to layer charge estimations over those samples.  CEC \nvalues around 110 moles/100gr of clay correspond to Layer charge on the order of  0,55 \ne/huc and  values around 90 moles/100gr of clay  to layer charges around 0,46 e/huc. \nThe amount of dodecylammonium Chloride (C12H28ClN) used for organophilization was \nestablished proportional to the CEC average. Regarding the implications on physical \nproperties and organophilization, XRD patterns of Organophilic clays showed a tendency \non expandability as a function of layer charge in terms of their 001 (C12H28ClN)-\n\n\n\n8 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nMontmorillonite peak position, ranging from 17,05 \u00c5 To 17,68 \u00c5. They could all be \nconsidered as bilayer intercalated Organoclay complexes, classically expected at 17,46 \n\u00c5 according size of the alkyl chain used, and the known sorption isotherm. The slight \nvariances are indicating the presence of non-intercalated sheets due to charge \nheterogeneity. Despite the slight d-spacing differences among samples, the relationship \n001 Organophilic C profile as a function of layer charge has a  perfect correlation. \nComparing a single profile,  001 d-spacing of organoclays tends to increase with \nincreasing layer charge. The position of the 001 peak ranges between 17.15 \u00c5 and 17.5 \n\u00c5 and the raw 001 peak area after organophilization can vary from 2620.6(cps x deg)  to  \n418.8 (cps x deg).  \nThe tendencies observed for layer charge spatial distribution are probably related to \ngradual variations of permeability and water/rock ratio during alteration,  the middle zone \nof the bed that concentrates higher values of layer charge also has showed very frequent  \npresence of spherulitic textures that may belonged originally of opal-CT but replaced by \nrecrystallized quartz unlike top and bottom of the bed, also  Zeolites XRD traces were \nonly found in samples located from 4 to 6 m depth,  indicating that water rock ratio close \nto the threshold where Zeolites are favored with respect to smectites as a product of \nalteration.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nCHAPTER II \nGeneralities \n\n2.1 \u2013 Location \n \nThe bentonite deposit at Ba\u00f1ado de Medina, object of this study is located about 20 Km \nSouth West of the small city named Melo, on the road to Fraile Muerto, Northern \nUruguay, as shown in the satellite image (Figure 1) \n \n\n \nFigure 1- Geographical location of the Bentonite deposit at Ba\u00f1ado de Medina \n\nThere are two overlapping properties in the deposit 84 and 162 Hectares respectively, \nbasically Cattle farms constituted by flatlands \u201cPampas\u201d that are very characteristic of the \nregion.

It evolved from the alteration of \nvolcanic ashes deposited in a lagoonal to transitional environment that belongs \nstratigraphycally to Late Permian Rio do Rastro Formation (equivalent to Yaguari \nFormation in Uruguay, Andreis et al., 1996, Rocha-Campos et al., 2010). This implies  \nthat it may constitute one of the oldest bentonite deposits known and yet it\u2019s been kept \nunder remarkably well preserved, due to the special geological context linked to a \nintracratonic basin (Paran\u00e1 Basin) and more locally due to a series of faults that \nprotected the rather thin bed from erosion. Therefore it represents an outstanding source \nfor academic research to achieve more knowledge about the digenetic process itself and \nalso the way physical and chemical properties can vary as a function of their spatial \ndistribution. \n\nThe bentonite bed at Ba\u00f1ado de Medina has been correlated to a regional scale of \nrhyolitic volcanic source occurrences, (Coutinho et al. 1981, 1991), where the volcanic \nsource was probably located in southwestern Argentina and Chile. Formoso et al (1998) \ndated the bed as Earlier to Mid Permian. Calarge et al (2001) and Meunier et al (2005) \ncorrelated Ba\u00f1ado de medina to the bentonite occurrences at Acegua, Southern Brazil, \nbased upon mineralogical similarities and chemical signature of heavy minerals and rare \nearth elements (REE). They suggested that variations in major element, RRE and minor \nelement abundances throughout the massive clay deposit indicate two successive ash \nfalls. Moreover, the abundance of trace elements indicates a fractionated volcanic glass \nderived from rhyolitic magmas produced in a subduction/collision geological context. \n\nAbout the volcanic source and in a more regional scale, a precise work was presented by \nRocha-Campos et al (2009). These researchers stated that the Choiyoi igneous province \nfrom San Rafael block located in central Western Argentina (Patagonia) should be \nconsidered as source for the ash fall deposits during the Permian section of the Parana \nBasin, along the Pacific margin of Southwest Gondwana and the geological evolution of \nneighboring Paleozoic Foreland basins in South America and Africa.  Figure 3 shows a \ngeographical influential spectrum of the volcanic ash source. Although Melo has been \ndated as Permian, it is also accepted that volcanic activity in Northern Patagonia reached \nan activity peak in the Triassic and early Jurassic (Andreis et al, . 1996) and these events \nhave been described as more highly explosive due to the felsic nature of the magmas \n(Axelrod, 1985). \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \nFigure 3 - Circles at  1000 and 2000 Km radius centered on the San Rafael area and Northeastern Choyoi igneous \nprovince towards the Parana Basin; Base map: ash distribution during the Quiza pu eruption of 1932 (Hiltrech and \nDrake, 1992).

(2009) \n\n \n \n\n2.4 - Background \n2.4.1 - Justification for this research \n \nThe project has been justified in the introduction regarding the importance of layer charge \nspatial distribution and possible implications on industrial applications of bentonites, \nnevertheless there are other aspect of this investigation that are worthy to be mentioned: \n\n \n1. At the moment the small quarry in Ba\u00f1ado de Medina is being mined with \n\nopencast methods without mixing criteria or homogenizing throughout the different \nfronts.  About 25% to 35 % of the 9 m to 7 m typical profile is discarded; only the \nvery high smectitic section of the bed is currently exploited. XRD traces in the \ncurrent research show how at depths 1.5 m - 2,2 m from the top soil have a \nsignificant dioctahedral montmorillonite content that can vary from 60% to 25%. \nSuch is the case of profiles F1, C and F2 (Fig 3 - F1 profile whole rock XRD as a \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nfunction of depth), According to the end uses mixing of materials with different \nmontmorillonite contents could be convenient in order to extend reserves and \nservice life for this deposit. \n\n \n2. At a regional scale, the implications of the results derived from this research could \n\nprovide valuable prospection criteria, considering that the volcanic source for this \nbentonite deposit was located in the Argentinean Northern Patagonia and was \nactive until the Late Jurassic. The distance from the source to the deposit \nconstitutes sufficient reason to believe that is very possible to find similar deposits \nof economical interest in the broader area. Similar beds, though with insignificant \nthickness, have been found in South Brazil. By understanding the diagenetic \nconditions of this deposit and all preserving variables one could establish \nparameters to predict other possible occurrences. At a more global scale, this \ndeposit represents a unique opportunity to study a bentonite deposit with the \ncharacteristics mentioned before, and this is perhaps the first attempt to do so \nunder this perspective.  In addition, by going deeper into how the layer charge of \nthis deposit varies and how it affects all physical properties, we could draw \nconclusions that will enable to predict qualities of other deposits as a consequence \nof their own diagenetic process. \n\n \n3. The fact that estimation of layer charge will be performed by two different \n\nmethods2, will provide a good comparison over a set of samples with different \nlayer charge values and just above the error margin of the methods. \n\n \n \n \n2.4.2 Related studies about Melo. \n \n \nThe bentonite occurrence has been first reported by Go\u00f1i (1952) an then by Bossi \n(1966). In the section \u201cGeological context\u201d (page 6) there is a complete description of the \nwhole evolution regarding the geological origin of Melo Bentonite deposit and a \nchronology of related research. However, there are other investigations that were \nconsulted along the progress of this work that they also provided valuable information. \n \nThe research performed by Calarge et al (2003) proposes the idea of layer charge \nheterogeneity for this deposit as a function of swelling capability. Although these authors \ndescribe the stratiform bentonite as a 1,5 m thick smectite rich bed, which contains less \nthan 5% non clay minerals. In contrast the current research showed that the highly pure \nbentonite bed can be up to 5 m thick and its mineralogical  composition vary widely \n\n                                                 \n2 Christidis Eberl method (Christidis E.

On behalf that publication one can say that the exposure of a \nwhole perspective at the quarry is a rather recent event. Calarge et al.(2003) proposed a \nlayer charge of -0,45 per half unit cell3, and the presence of smectites randomly \ninterstratified in terms of layer charge magnitudes, to explain layer charge \nheterogeneities and the observed presence of non-expandable layers. This idea seems \nto be in agreement with what was observed in this work in the spatial distribution of layer \ncharge and we will comment further on this later on at results. \n\n \nSeveral works developed at UFRGS about Ba\u00f1ado de Medina where also consulted. \nPublished work on the geology, mineralogy and technological applicaitons of Melo \nbentonite by Delfino et al.

This campaign \nprovided samples of profiles B and C used in the present investigation. The CEC of the \nbentonite varied between Between 101 and 116 meq/100g and the bentonite reserves \nwere estimated to be 580.000 metric tones. \n   \n \n2.4.2 Related studies on Layer charge  \n \nThe Clay Mineral Society (CMS) published on 1994 the workshop lecture, Volume 6 \n\nnamed Layer charge characteristics of 2:1 silicate clay minerals. It is a key document \n\nused as a ground base to interpret interactions between montmorillonite and amines as a \n\nfunction of layer charge (Lagaly, 1994, Laird, 1994). Particularly the chapters developed \n\nby G. Lagaly, \u201clayer charge determination by alkylammonium Ions\u201d, the one by D.A. Laird \n\n\u201cEvaluation of structural formula and Alkilammonium methods of determining layer \n\ncharge\u201d. And Specially the one offered by S.A. Boyd and W.F. Jaynes.  This work was \n\nalso used as a reference of related studies about organophilization. \n\n  \nChristidis &amp; Eberl (2003) proposed one of the methods used in this research to estimate \n\nlayer charge and charge heterogeneity. The mentioned publication explains how from 29 \n\nwell characterized samples loaded on a data base, is possible to compare  XRD patterns \n\nafter potassium saturation and ethylene glycol solvation to obtain layer charge magnitude \n\nand heterogeneity from profile fitting or by peak position criteria. The layer charge \n\nprogram that resulted from this work was written on Visual Basic and the code employed \n\n                                                 \n3 This value is among the range of layer charge magnitudes obtained in this study, tending towards the lower limit. \n(from -0,44 to -0,56 per half unit cell) \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nby macro function of Microsoft Excel.

This publication \n\nshowed evidence for cryptic variations in bentonite deposits, as was reported by \n\nChristidis and Makri (2007) in a bentonite deposit located in Milos-Greece and in a 1 m \n\nthick bed in Charentes, France by Alain Meunier et al (2004). \n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Variation of C.E.C and the (Al2O3+Fe2O3)/MgO ratio with depth in Smectites \n\nfrom a Bentonite deposit located in Charentes, France. Data from Meunier et al (2004) \n\n(after Christidis &amp; Huff, 2009) \n\n2.4.3 - Related studies on Organophilization \n \nIt is widely accepted that layer charge is the most important parameter of smectites when \norganophilization is intended (A.R. Murray, 1994). Nevertheless, It is classically C.E.C \nthe parameter used to estimate the amount of amines that will be added in the process. \nAlthough C.E.C and layer charge usually should be directly related, there are other \nparameters that may affect this relationship, such as crystal size, stacking sequence and \narrangement, charge density, etc. Nevertheless this topic is not a matter of this research. \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nOn the other hand, industrially it is perhaps the proportion of the smectite present in a \ngiven bentonite the main factor to take into account, not only for organoclays but also in \nany kind of activation and many other processes. \nTherefore, is important to outline that organophilicity itself if is not the purpose of this \nresearch but a mean to evaluate a tangible influence of layer charge spatial variations on \nthe efficiency of the amine-clay intercalation. \nBasic evaluation parameters and principles  where extracted from  The Clay Mineral \nSociety 1994 workshop lecture, Volume 6, chapter by S.A.

Ten representative samples \nwere selected with spatial position criteria; subsequently they were wet sieved to obtain \n>53  ?m fraction for observation of heavy minerals. Afterwards the > 1 ?m size fraction \nwas obtained by sedimentation according to Stokes law using deionised water.  Ethylene \nGlycol treatment was done in rounds of no more than 5 samples at a time to avoid \nevaporation of ethylene glycol; samples were put in a glass desiccator at 60\u00b0C for a \nperiod ranging 16 hrs to 24 hrs. \nNa and K saturation was performed on the&lt;1 ?m fractions using 1M NaCl and KCl \nsolutions respectively. The samples were saturated for at least 4 times, the last one \novernight under mechanical agitation. Each time the solution was changed. After \nsaturation the samples were rinsed shortly by dispersing the clay fractions with an  \nultrasound device and finally washed four times with ethyl alcohol.  \n  \n \n3.2 SEM \n\n \nScanning electron microscopy was performed in a JEOL 6060 SEM. The samples were \nmounted on metallic stubs using a double stick electrically-conductive carbon tape,and \ncoated with gold and carbon as is usually done in UFRGS geosciences department for \nbetter imaging. Only morphology was observed because there was no EDX analysis \navailable. \n  \n3.3 Optical Microscopy. \n\n \nThe optical microscopy was performed with a Leika DMLP optical microscope. Freshly \ncut bentonite samples were mounted on petrographic slides with a special glue to avoid \nfracture when swelling. Then they were dry polished to ~ 100 ?m thickness.  \n\n \n3.4 TG analysis \n \nA set of 20 samples were analyzed on a PerkinElmer thermo-gravimetric analyzer TGA \n6. The thermal analysis was run up to 920\u00b0 C on a heating ramp of 20 C\u00b0 per minute. \nSamples where finely ground and the initial mass used varied from 15 mg to 30 mg. \n \n \n3.5 XRF analysis \nChemical analysis of whole rock and&lt;1?m size fraction was determined using the X-Ray \nfluorescence (XRF) technique, using an S 2 Ranger EDX spectrometer by Bruker. A total \nof 42 samples5 and ten random control duplicates were used to prepare fusion beads. \nLoss on Ignition (LOI) was determined before melting following the procedure explained \n\n                                                 \n5 21 Whole rock samples and 21&lt;1 ?m samples \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nin next paragraph. Fired powders after determination of  LOI were mixed with Lithium \ntetraborate (B4Li2O7) flux under the following conditions: \n\n1. Mixing proportion whole rock:flux was 5:16. \n\n2. Mixing proportions for most&lt;1 ?m fractions was 8:17. Although some \nsamples had a different proportion this ratio was kept and used in the \ninstrument software settings to calibrate concentrations. \n\n3. Samples were gently ground, and weighed, then B4Li2O7 was added \nprogressively to obtain a homogenous powder, subsequently the mixtures \nwere placed in platinum crucibles and finally three drops of lithium bromide \n(BrLi) were added and the samples were melted in a Claisse M4 gas Fluxer \nto obtain the fusion beads.  \n\n \n\n3.6 Loss on Ignition (L.O.I.) \n \n\nL.O.I was estimated for all 42 samples and 10 aleatory selected duplicates by following \nthis steps: \n\n1. Porcelain crucibles were weighed after drying in an oven at 110\u00baC. \n2. Each crucible was labeled and filled with a powder either of whole rock or \n\n<1?m particle size, dried for at least 3 hrs at 105\u00baC and weighed. Then the \ndry weight of the samples was recorded.  \n\n3. Subsequently the powders were fired for 2 hrs at 1000\u00baC. Finally from the \ndifference of the weight after drying and and after firing, the LOI was \nestimated. \n\n \n3.7 Cation Exchange Capacity (C.E.C) estimation. \n\n \nC.E.C was estimated by the Ammonium Acetate method (NH3) and concentrations were \nmeasured using a Spectrometer with Lithium-Ion Battery Hach DR 2800. A total of \nthirteen samples were collected selectively according to layer charge criteria, This were \nthe same samples that later on were use for Organophilization and the intention behind \nCEC determination was to estimate the quantity of amine necessary for effective \nOrganophilization, Hence the clay-organic interaction was used to evaluate the \neffectiveness of the process and to corroborate the trend observed for the layer charge \ndistribution as a function of depth, provided that the two parameters should be directly \ncorrelated. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n6 7,5 gr of B4Li2O7 over 1,5 gr of sample after L.O.I. \n\n7 8 gr of B4Li2O7 mixed with 1 gr of sample after L.O.I. \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n1. About 0.5 g of the&lt;1?m fractions was dried for 3 hrs at 105\u00baC and placed in \ncentrifuge tubes; about 0.3g of dry sample was used to determine CEC. \n\n2. 10 ml of 1M ammonium acetate were added in the tubes and the clay \nsuspensions were agitated for 1 hour. Afterwards the solution was decanted. A \nsecond saturation with 1M ammonium acetate took place under continuous \nagitation for 24 hours. \n\n3. Then the samples were  rinsed four times with ethanol (30 ml each time), to \nremove excess acetate. \n\n4. Subsequently the samples were leached with 25 ml of potassium chloride 1M \nthree times. The the supernatant solutions were stored and the volume was \nmade up to 100 ml. \n\n5. The ammonium concentration in the solution was measured in the  \nspectrophotometer following this steps \n\na. The solutions were diluted to 5% to be in the absorbance range of the \nequipment8. \n\nb. Then 3 drops of Mineral Stabilizer, 3 drops of Polyvinyl Alcohol \nDispensing Agent and 1 ml of Nessler Reagent were added and the \nsolutions were allowed the reaction to occur for 1 minute. \n\nc. The Polyvinyl Alcohol Dispersing Agent aids formation of yellow color \nafter reaction of Nessler Reagent with ammonium ions. The color \nintensity is proportional to the ammonium concentration. The \nabsorbance values obtained were then transformed into ammonium \nconcentration according to the curve shown in Figure 6 \n\n \nFigure  5 - Calibration curve used for determination of NH4. \n\n                                                 \n8 \u2022 Concentration Range: 0,02 to 2,50 mg/L N-NH3 \n\nN-NH3 curve\n\ny = 0.509x\nR2 = 1.000\n\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n\n1\n1.2\n1.4\n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5\n\nmg N-NH3 / L\n\nAb\ns c\n\nor\nr 4\n\n25\n n\n\nm\n\n\n\n21 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nAfter concentration is known then we proceeded establish the relationship between this \nvalue and CEC as it is shown at table 6 located in the section of this documents that \nrefers to Organophilization. \n\n \n\n3.8 Layer charge determination. \n \n\nBeing the main object of this study to establish precisely if the layer charge is \nsystematically distributed in the bentonite bed, the estimation of the layer charge was \ncarried out by two methods. One of them inlvolved observing XRD patterns after  \npotassium saturation and ethylene glycol solvation of the clay samples and subsequent \ncomparison with XRD simulated traces calculated from three component interlayering \n(Christidis &amp; Eberl, 2003). The profile fitting is done with a excel sheet that was an output \nof this investigation and offers at the same time two different ways to compare the \nmeasured XRD values to the data base of the LayerCharge program (Christidis &amp; Eberl, \n2003). (1)-Whole profile fitting (2) - peak position fitting. Both values were calculated and \nare discussed in the results chapter.  \n\nFigures 6 and 7 show a screen displayed of the two methods provided by the program of \nlayer charge determinations described before \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6 \u2013 Layer charge determination by Whole pattern method. \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 7 - Layer charge determination by peak position method \n\n \n\nThe second method uses the structural formula calculation (Schultz, 1969; Newman \nEberl et al.,1986; Newman and Brown 1987; Onal, 2006) from the data obtained by XRF \nchemical analysis results in &lt;1 ?m samples. This last method will also provide enough \ninformation about the octahedral and tetrahedral distribution of the layer charge. \n\n \n\nA slight correction was perform to SiO2 values of chemical data to establish a reliable \nstructural formula for montmorillonite. In the XRD traces it is possible to notice the \npresence of quartz, which has a tendency to decrease as a function of depth. A semi \nquantitative determination of quartz was made from the 101 reflection, which was \nsubsequently subtracted from the SiO2 determined by XRF. The figure 8 shows an \nexample of the C profile, were the XRD pattern of K saturated, EG solvated&lt;1 ?m \noriented slides at 1.4 m depth contains ca 10% of Quartz, and the one at 8.3 m is just \nabove the detection limit for quartz9, 1%. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n9 For this equipment  is around 0.2 to 0.3 %. \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 8 \u2013 XRD patters of C profile samples K-saturated and ethylene glycol \nsolvated as a function of depth. \n\n  \nNote: Conclusions about Layer charge heterogeneity will derive from Christidis &amp; Eberl \nmethod and layer charge octahedral or tetrahedral location from structural formula \nmethod.  \n 3.9 Organophilization \n \nThe purpose of preparing  organo-clay complexes in this study was to evaluate the \ninfluence of layer charge variance in Melo bentonite deposit on the capability to interact \nin one of most significant industrial applications of these materials. Most variables were \nfixed like: type, concentration of dodecylammonium chloride (C12H28ClN) and preparation \nof amine, ageing time, montmorillonite size fraction and amount, etc. Moreover, \nconditions on which organophilization was performed for all samples can be considered \nequal. \n \nWe used 12 samples selected according to layer charge criteria. The whole C profile was \ntreated as a model for possible trends observed, and also samples F2 M1, F2 M2, F2 \nM5, F2 M7, F2 M8 and F2 M9. Profile F2 had a similar overall trend but some deviations \nin layer charge values as a function of depth was the reason why it was selected.

Two of them, named F1 and F2 where fresh cut sampled \non the mining front at the open cut. Profile F2 is 8.2 m high and consists of 9 samples \ntaken by macroscopic differences and other features as shown in the figure 11. Profile F1 \non the other hand only has 3 representative samples for top, middle area and bottom in \norder to reduce the quantity of material to be analyzed without losing the volumetric \nperspective of the whole study. Profiles B an C belong to boreholes taken by a research \nteam from the UFRGS in 2009 (Delfino et al. ,2010).  \n \nThree samples of these profiles are kept in the Geological department of that University. \nProfile B corresponds to the original BC 1-2 and C to B2. Five samples where taken from \neach profile from depths that had apparent correlation, with the intention to establish a \nlong range horizontal comparison. \n \n \n\nB 1,75 m B 3,3 m B 5,2 m B 6,2 m B 8,2 m \n\n \n  \n\n  \n\nFigure 12 - Example of profile B sampling from bore holes. \n \nIt is evident that each sample has a defined and unique macroscopic appearance \ncompared to others in the same profile. They were selected according to this divergences \nnot with the intention to expect dramatic property changes from one to another, but to be \nable to correlate the horizons among the 4 profiles assuming that hence we found that \nthey is roughly continuous log profile with depth having similar macroscopic appearance \nover the levels, then we are able to establish long range correlation. The main \nmacroscopic observation are variations on the sand content, levels of high iron oxide, \nlevels of what appears to be magnesium oxides and levels that can be called pure \nmontmorillonitic.

We will slighty point them out here and they will \nbe discussed further on in the document. \n \n\n? Decrease of SiO2 and increase of Al2O3 contents are in accordance with  \nobservations in random XRD traces and LOI about increasing clay content as a \nfunction of depth. \n\n? Increase of CaO with depth is probably associated with  smectite interlayer.  \n? K2O and Na2O both tend to decrease with depth, suggesting that probably \n\nthere is not a single feldspar phase and they are decreasing as a function of \ndepth, similar to quartz at the expense of Ca \u2013Montmorillonite. We can state \nthat albite and K-feldspar are present in Melo. \n\n? Fe2O3 content along the profiles tends to have a non-systematic behaviour, \nprobably due to the presence of some oxides not detected by XRD. There is a \ngeneral trend to increase with depth, suggesting that it is located basicaly as \noctahedral substitutions (as Fe3+).  \n\n? MgO also tends to increase with depth. It is relatively high along the profile (up \nto more than 6%). Magnesium is present as octahedral substitution and is \nperhaps the major factor for high layer charge on all samples. \n\n? Other interesting features can be deduced from TiO2 being more abundant at \nthe middle of the bed. This feature could have important implications in terms \nof the known tendency of Ti to be an immobile element and diagenetic \ncharacteristics that will be discussed later on. \n\ny = -0,0095x + 0,0363 \nR\u00b2 = 0,5447 \n\nLo\nss\n\n o\nn \n\nIg\nni\n\nti\non\n\n \n\nDepth (m) \n\nWole rock (all profiles)  \n\nWole rock (all profiles) Linear (Wole rock (all profiles) )\n\n\n\n34 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n?

The observed spherulitic \ntextures are typical for devitrified volcanic glass glass. Although opal-CT was not \ndetected in XRD traces the characteristic spherulitic textures probably belonged originally \nto opal-CT which was replaced by recrystallization to quartz, or very unlikely but possibly, \nit is still is preserved but in small amounts.  \n \nEither opal-CT or quartz may form from crystallization of the volcanic glass. That means \nthat the quartz present in the deposit could have been derived either from opal-CT or \ncould have been formed directly from divitrification of volcanic glass.   \n \n \n \n4.6 -Layer charge estimation and spatial variations \n \nThe first method applied was the Christidis Eberl method, which uses the LayerCharge \ncomputer program (Christidis &amp; Eberl, 2003), as explained in \u201cmaterials and methods\u201d \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nsection.

To approach the question of \npreservation conditions we accept the fact that e geological context linked to a \nintracratonic basin (Paran\u00e1 Basin) was dominated by a rather low diagenetic conditions, \na maximum temp of around 55 \u00baC was estimated from vitrinite analyses of a coal Bed \nthat belongs to Rio Bonito formation( L. Calarge et al 2001). However, this is not \nsufficient to explain neither the atypical thickness for a stratiform layer of Bentonite \ndeveloping from volcanic ash alteration over lagoon to transitional environment that can \narise up to almost 6 m or the preservation from erosion, weathering and other surface \nrelated degradation processes. If volcanic ashes were so voluminous that in a lagoonal \nenvironment a bed of 6 m thickness was formed, then we would have to ask , what \nhappened to the surrounding material derived from this events considering that the \nvolcanic source is located more than 1000 km away?  \n \nOn the other hand, the spatial evolution on mineralogical composition indicates a clear \ntends to decrease trace minerals as quartz and feldspar to an increment of magnesium \nrich dioctahedral montmorillonite which electrical disequilibrium tends to be compensated \nprimarily by Ca+ cations in the interlayer. XRD patterns on whole rock, XRF chemical \nresults and heavy minerals observations and all in agreement with mineralogical \nproportion evolution as a function of depth. But if this is the case, why is there not a \nsingle trace of I/S mixed layer over the top of the deposit where smectite proportions are \naround 50% of the overall mineral composition and Na is present within Albite. The only \nevidence of Illite shown on XRD is traces was found at 1.5 m depth having a relatively \nsmall refection and clearly pure Illite, what lead\u2019s us tu think that it is provably from \ndetrital origins hence transition mixed layered phases are totally absent.  \n \nAs a consequence we can propose that as a locally, there is  a model that can explain all \nuncertainties expressed before by means of structural and mineralogical arguments \nregistered in this research. We believe that a set of parallel oriented faults described by \nALbarnaz et al,2010; had buried part of the original diagenetic bed, hence the deposit at \nMelo is actually modelled by taking two equally oriented faults as boundaries, above this \nlimits drill bores resulted with no signals of Bentonite. Moreover, It is likely that \nsurrounded overlying Bentonites where then transported and carrying larger content of \naccessory minerals. This could explain the great thickness of the bed and uneven \ndistribution of mineral phases as a function of depth.  It would also explain why this rather \nsmall occurrence has preserved for such a long time and surrounded areas that most \nprobably were also containing Bentonite has now been eroded.

It was also in agreement with cation \nexchange capacity results, in which samples tend to be polarized in two groups when \nplotting CEC vs. layer charge, one group having CEC 85-100 eq.mol/100g and lower \nlayer charge values, and the other group having CEC 100-120 eq.mol/100g and higher \nlayer charge values. \nFurthermore, the &lt;1 \u00b5m size fractions are characterized by higher Mg and Al contents as \na function of depth, both cations being present mostly in octahedral sites. However the \nrate of increase of Al with depth is greater than the remaining octahedral located cations. \nThis would affect gradually the magnitude and distribution of layer charge as was \nobserved along the research. \n \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 32 \u2013 Mayor Cations affecting layer charge as a function of Depth. \n\nMgO (% ) with Depth\n\n0.00\n\n2.00\n\n4.00\n\n6.00\n\n8.00\n\n10.00\n\n12.00\n\n14.00\n\n16.00\n\n18.00\n\n20.00\n\n1.4 1.5 1.75 1.75 2.1 2.5 3.1 3.3 3.5 4 4.1 4.8 5.2 5.5 6 6 6.2 7.3 7.5 8.2 8.3 8.3\n\nDepth  (m)\n\nO\nxi\n\nde\ns \n\n%\n o\n\nve\nr \n\n th\ne \n\n<1\n u\n\nm\n  f\n\nra\nct\n\nio\nn \n\nMgO (%) Al2O3 Fe2O3% Linear (MgO (%)) Linear (Al2O3) Linear (Fe2O3%)\n\n\n\n50 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nhe fact that the Bentonite bed is placed over a sandstone layer could have created \nalteration conditions in which the water/ rock ratio along the profile would form a greater \nnumber of octahedral substitutions in the middle of the deposit and consequently higher \nlayer charge.  \n\nProfile P1 did not have a coherent behavior compared to the other three profiles, perhaps \nbecause samples were obtained from the oldest exposed mining front; only three \nsamples were taken from this location and although the layer charge values were on the \nsame range we did not observe the same systematic trend with depth. As a general \nremark we can outline that results over the boreholes were largely more consistent than \nthe ones obtained over fresh cut samples on mining fronts.  \n\n \n \n5.3 - Regarding Organophilization and physical properties \n \nAll Organophilic XRD patterns showed a similar d-spacing of the 001 (C12H28ClN)-\nMontmorillonite complex, ranging from 17,05 \u00c5 to 17,68 \u00c5. They could all be considered \nas bilayer complexes according to the size of the alkyl chain used, and the known \nsorption isotherm (Boyd and James, 1994). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 33 \u2013 Arrangement of Alkylammonium ions in mica-type silicates with different \n\nlayer charges. A) Lateral Monolayer, B) Lateral Bilayer, C) Paraffin-type monolayer and \nD) Paraffin type bilayer.  \n\nThe basal spacing for each type of intercalation can be described as step wise. Inr mono-\nbilayer transitions with samples having layer charge heterogeneity the transition can \noccur over a range of alkylammonium carbon chain length rather than in a single discrete \nstep (Figure33).  \n\n\n\n51 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nFollowing this principles we were able to establish a linear trend on the XRD traces of \n(C12H28ClN)-smectite, between the 001 d-spacing of the organophilic smectites and the \nlayer charge estimated prior to organophilization. Similar trend was observed between \nthe layer charge and the net and raw peak areas of the resulting organophilic clays. \nConsequently we can expect that layer charge spatial distribution could have important \ninfluence on the quality of interaction of bentonites not only when organophilization is \nintended but for any other application based on physical properties of smectites present \nin bentonites.  \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n52 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n5.4 -Conclusions \n \n\n1 \u2013 Layer charge spatial variation for the Ba\u00f1ado de Medina Bentonite deposit displays a \nclear tendency to increase at the middle of the bed. We believe that more important than \nthe trend itself it is the fact that diagenetic processes and alteration implicit on Bentonite \noccurrences, tend to have a gradual cryptic, and rational distribution; directly relative to \nthe formation characteristics and preservation afterwards. To use this mineral resource \nproperly one needs to understand the specific emplacement of and distribution of \noctahedral and tetrahedral substitutions in smectite structure, for it is layer charge the \ndriven force for all 2:1 phyllosilicates interaction in any application context.   \nTherefore we could not expect that the tendency of layer charge spatial distribution \nobserved could be extrapolated to other deposits of similar origins, but the basic \nprinciples should apply; even more important, by understanding it\u2019s own formation \ncontext one could predict eventually what kind of layer charge spatial distribution a \nspecific deposit could have. \n\n \n2 \u2013 The hypothesis offered in this document about the local conditions that lead to the \npreservation of the Melo Bentonite deposit, shall be further studied. Perhaps a way to do \nso would be simply by analyzing the evolution of heavy minerals and specific textures \nobserved in quartz as a function of depth. Also the distribution of feldspar minerals could \nhelp to better understand which prospecting criteria could be used on the task to find \nsimilar bentonite occurrences regionally. \n 3 \u2013 A very clear correlation was observed by comparing XRD traces from organoclays, \n(C12H28ClN)-Montmorillonite, with the layer charge values. The most evident \norganophilicity efficiency as a function of layer charge was established by correlating \nlayer charge spatial distribution with respect to amine intercalated 001 d-spacing peak \narea analysis. The 001 d-spacing of the organoclay tends to increase with increasing \nlayer charge. The position of the 001 peak ranges between 17.15 \u00c5 and 17.5 \u00c5 and the \nraw 001 peak area after organophilization can vary from 2620.6(cps x deg)  to  418.8 \n(cps x deg). They can all be considered as bilayer intercalated complexes. Nevertheless \nwe can expect that the influence of layer charge spatial distribution could have more \ntangible effect when compared with other applications, such as acid activation or \nviscosity, because evaluation of results will not be presented over a stepwise expandable \nbehavior typical of amine-clay interactions.  \n\n4 \u2013 Some direct implications of these results could be applied to actual bentonite mining. \nIt is the usual practice to estimate the quantity of reactants when trying to stimulate cation \nexchange according to the smectite proportion within the bentonite. Physical parameters \nlike layer charge are considered to be fixed. This new approach would have an impact \nnot only on the way bentonites are treated but also on the way they are mixed after \nextraction resulting probably in a more homogeneous material if the correct criteria of \nlayer charge spatial variations are used. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n53 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n5.5 - References  \n \n\n\u2022 Ahmetr Mermut and G.
