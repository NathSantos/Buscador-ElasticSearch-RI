Estas incluem tr\u00eas campanhas de Chirp (RIAV99, RIAV02 e\nRIAV02A) e duas campanhas de Boomer (VOUGA86 e RIAV03).

A heterogeneidade da\ncobertura s\u00edsmica, da qualidade do sinal, da penetra\u00e7\u00e3o e da resolu\u00e7\u00e3o, no\nseu conjunto constrangeram o uso dos dados a interpreta\u00e7\u00f5es detalhadas,\nmas locais, de objectos geol\u00f3gicos da Ria. \u00c9 apresentado um procedimento \npara determinar a escolha de escalas adequadas para modelar os objectos\ngeol\u00f3gicos, baseado na resolu\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00edsmica, erros de posicionamento\nconhecidos e desfasamentos m\u00e9dios entre horizontes. As evid\u00eancias de \nacumula\u00e7\u00e3o e escape de g\u00e1s na Ria de Aveiro incluem turbidez ac\u00fastica,\nreflex\u00f5es refor\u00e7adas, cortinas ac\u00fasticas, domas, \u201cpockmarks\u201d e alinhamentos \nde \u201cpockmarks\u201d enterradas, horizontes perturbados e plumas ac\u00fasticas na\ncoluna de \u00e1gua (flares).

Ainda assim,\nnestes sistemas de baixa profundidade de \u00e1gua, as varia\u00e7\u00f5es da altura de\nmar\u00e9 t\u00eam um impacto significativo na detec\u00e7\u00e3o de g\u00e1s com m\u00e9todos ac\u00fasticos,\natrav\u00e9s de altera\u00e7\u00f5es nas amplitudes originais de reflex\u00f5es refor\u00e7adas,\nturbidez ac\u00fastica e branqueamento ac\u00fastico em zonas com g\u00e1s. Os padr\u00f5es \nencontrados confirmam que o escape de bolhas de g\u00e1s \u00e9 desencadeado pela\ndescida da mar\u00e9. H\u00e1 acumula\u00e7\u00f5es de g\u00e1s em sedimentos Holoc\u00e9nicos e no\nsubstrato de argilas e calc\u00e1rios do Mesoz\u00f3ico. Evid\u00eancias directas de escape\nde g\u00e1s em sondagens em zonas vizinhas, mostraram g\u00e1s essencialmente\nbiog\u00e9nico. A maioria do g\u00e1s na \u00e1rea deve ter sido gerado em sedimentos\nlagunares Holoc\u00e9nicos. No entanto, a localiza\u00e7\u00e3o e geometria de estruturas de\nescape de fluidos em alguns canais de mar\u00e9, seguem o padr\u00e3o de fracturas do\nsubstrato Mesoz\u00f3ico, indicando uma poss\u00edvel fonte mais profunda de g\u00e1s e \nque estas fracturas funcionam como condutas preferenciais de migra\u00e7\u00e3o dos \nfluidos e exercem um controlo estrutural na ocorr\u00eancia de g\u00e1s na Ria. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n  \n\n  \n \n\nAcknowledgements \n \n\nThis thesis took a long time coming, and still, it would hardly have been done if\nnot for the support of many that will try to acknowledge here.

The\nglobal importance and impact in coastal zones of methane gas accumulation\nand seepage in sediments from coastal lagoon environments is still largely \nunknown. This Ph.D. investigates gas accumulation and seepage in tidal\nchannels of the Ria of Aveiro with data from five high resolution seismic \nsurveys carried out in 1986, 1999, 2002 and 2003. These include three Chirp \nsurveys (RIAV99, RIAV02, RIAV02A) and two Boomer surveys (VOUGA86 and \nRIAV03). The navigation data processing included instrumental error filters, \nsystem clock synchronization corrections, layback adjustment and trace\nmidpoint position estimate. The seismic signal processing consisted in \namplitude corrections, burst noise removal, static corrections, normal move-out \ncorrections, band-pass filtering, spike deconvolution and Stolt F-K migration. \nThe analysis of the track line regularity, the horizon misties and the first-break \nsurface models were applied as quality control procedures, and allowed the\nrevision and improvement of the processing parameters. The heterogeneity of\nthe seismic coverage, signal quality, penetration and resolution all constrain the\nuse of the data to mostly local but detailed interpretations and modeling of the \ngeological objects of the Ria of Aveiro. A procedure is presented to determine\nadequate choice of scales of these geological models based on the seismic\nresolution, known positioning errors and mean mistie values. Evidence of \nextensive gas accumulation and seepage in tidal channel sediments from the\n\u201cRia de Aveiro\u201d barrier-lagoon includes acoustic turbidity, enhanced reflections,\nacoustic blanking, domes, pockmarks and buried aligned pockmarks, disrupted \nhorizons and acoustic plumes in the water layer (flares). The stratigraphy and\nthe structural framework control the distribution and extent of the gas\naccumulations and seepage in the study area. However, in these shallow\nsystems, tidal altitude variations have a significant impact on gas detection with \nacoustic methods, by changing the raw amplitude of the enhanced seismic\nreflections, acoustic turbidity and acoustic blanking in gas-prone areas. \nAmplitudes are clearly stronger during low tide with maxima during ebb, \ndecreasing with flood with minima during high tide; this pattern confirms that\nbubbling and gas escape is triggered mainly by the falling tide. There are\naccumulations of gas both in the Holocene sediments and in the Mesozoic\nbedrock of marls and clays. Direct evidence of gas escape from drill-holes in \nthe surrounding area has shown that the gas recovered in the \u201cRia de Aveiro\u201d \nconsists of biogenic methane. Most of the gas in the study area was probably\nmainly generated in Holocene lagoon sediments. Nevertheless, the location \nand geometry of fluid escape features in some channels follows the fracture\npattern affecting the Mesozoic bedrock, indicating a possible deeper source of\ngas and that these fractures function as preferential pathways for fluid \nmigration and exert a structural control on gas occurrences in the Ria of Aveiro.\n\n \n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n\n \nTable of contents \n \n\n \n\nAgradecimentos \nPalavras-chave \nResumo \nAcknowledgments \nKeywords \nAbstract \nTable of contents................................................................................................... i \nList of Tables ....................................................................................................... iii \nList of Figures...................................................................................................... iii \n \n \n \nChapter 1.

Profile \nRiav03-P02B was acquired against the tidal current and the strong afternoon northerly wind, \nwhereas profile Riav03-P02C was acquired 100 m apart in the opposite direction. Compared \nwith profile P02C, profile P02B has a poorer signal to noise ratio and more burst noise. The \nchange in acquisition speed imposed by the strong currents is clearly illustrated by the \n\n iv \n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n\ndifference in the graphical scales, considering that the profiles are plotted with a constant \ntrace/cm ratio. ............................................................................................................................ 68 \n\nFigure III-18: Rock piles from harbor infrastructure observed on a boomer profile as side \nreflections. The higher sound velocity in the rocks causes reflections pull-ups. The physical \nproperties of the rock medium also cause a signal attenuation that results in weaker reflection \namplitudes bellow the rock piles. ............................................................................................... 69 \n\nFigure III-19: Reflections of the same structure imaged both by Boomer and Chirp profiles. \nAnalysis of these profiles illustrates the practical seismic resolution of the two datasets. The \nminimum separation of the reflections observed in the chirp profile is of 2 samples (0.242 ms, \ncorresponding to 18 cm for a sound velocity of 1500 m/s). The minimum separation of the \nreflections observed in the boomer profile is of 5 samples (0.5 ms, corresponding to 38 cm for \na sound velocity of 1500 m/s). ................................................................................................... 73 \n\nFigure III-20: Effects of variable profile spacing when mapping a fractal object.

This abacus plots lines of equal angular error for a given \nrelationship of positioning error and profile separation. Increases in positioning error and/or \ndecreases in profile separation result in a greater error of the modeled direction of a linear \nfeature. The positioning error related irregularity of a modeled linear feature can be minimized \nby limiting data input from profiles with adequate separation.

Thick solid lines show the \nlocation of the seismic profiles shown in this paper. The inset shows the location of the \navailable seismic lines and boreholes in the vicinity of the study area. Although there are no \nboreholes within the study area, the extent of the seismic coverage allowed the use of the \nparticularly dense borehole data in the southern edge of the inset to calibrate the main seismic \nunits, in particular the reflection corresponding to the top of the Cretaceous limestones and \nmarls, and to adjust the vertical datum of the seismic surveys. ................................................ 90 \n\nFigure IV-3: Acoustic evidence of gas accumulation and seepage from the NW gas field (GF1) \nobserved on Chirp profiles.

Interpretation of this plot difficult due to the suspected sampling \nproblems of the various tidal stages in the Terminal Sul, and because of the linear regression \nwas found to be a poor model of the sampled data.

Introduction \n \n\n1.1 Nature and scope of this work \n \n\nEstuaries and coastal lagoons are prime locations from both a human and \n\nenvironmental perspectives. These systems encompass some of the most \n\nproductive and diverse regions of the globe, and are the breeding grounds for \n\nmultiple species. This wealth also attracted and still attracts human settlement, \n\nmaking these the areas with the highest population density of the globe. The \n\neconomic importance of estuaries and coastal lagoons is also obvious, with \n\noceanic and river trade lanes meeting at the harbor facilities that seem to grow \n\nrelentlessly along its shores. Also, for all these reasons, anthropogenic impact is \n\nusually significant because of the widespread construction and polluting activities \n\nchanging the landscape and ecosystems. The knowledge about the geological \n\nprocesses governing the evolution of estuaries and coastal lagoons is essential for \n\nthe adequate assessment and management of its natural resources, for the \n\nevaluation of the risk of geological hazards and to provide fundamental knowledge \n\nfor environmental impact studies. \n\nThe Associated Laboratory, Center for Environmental and Marine Studies \n\n(Centro de Estudos do Ambiente e do Mar, CESAM) of the University of Aveiro \n\nResearch Institute has a research group on Geological and Geophysical \n\nProcesses which focuses on the dynamics of coastal and marine sediments. The \n\nwork presented here was done within the framework of CESAMs\u2019 Geological and \n\nGeophysical Processes research line, and its initial aim was to study the \n\ngeological evolution of the Ria of Aveiro, a barrier lagoon located in on the west \n\nPortuguese coast, and its adjacent continental shelf using high resolution seismic \n\nreflection methods and borehole log data from water wells (see location of the Ria \n\nof Aveiro in figure 1). The initial exploration of the available data and of the first \n\nresults from the seismic reflection surveys showed previously unknown seismic \n\n 1\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\nevidence of gas in the profiles of the Ria of Aveiro (Pinheiro, L., pers. \n\ncommunication), and was intensively investigated by several cruises (Monteiro \n\nand Pinheiro, 1986; Pinheiro and Monteiro, 1999; Pinheiro and Duarte, 2003a; \n\nPinheiro and Duarte, 2003b; Pinheiro et al., 2003). The investigation of these \n\noccurrences became the topic of this thesis (Duarte et al., 2007). \n\n \n\n \nFigure I-1 \u2013 Physiography and location of the study area, the Ria of Aveiro barrier lagoon \n(Northwest Portugal).  \n\n 2 \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n \n \n\n \n\nEstuaries and coastal lagoons are depocenters of organic-rich sediments \n\nwhich are sources of methane (Kelley et al., 1995; Van der Nat and Middelburg, \n\n2000). These systems are excellent and easily accessible natural laboratories to \n\ninvestigate the mechanisms of methane generation, accumulation, migration and \n\nescape (e.g. Garcia-Gil, 2003). Nevertheless, the geological investigation of \n\nestuaries and, in particular, barrier lagoon environments is particularly difficult, \n\nbecause these are complex, very dynamic, fast changing and evolving systems \n\nthat require extensive and detailed data for their study. In addition, the acquisition \n\nof large data sets is hindered by the methodological limitations imposed by the \n\ndifficulty in accessing the geological objects, usually partially or permanently \n\nsubmerged, which also involves access to ship time. Furthermore, the spatial and \n\ntemporal variability and the complexity of these shallow gas systems require \n\ndense grids of geophysical data in order to get representative sampling. As a \n\nresult, the importance of the escape of methane gas from sediments of estuarine \n\nand lagoon environments to the atmosphere is still poorly known or \n\nunderestimated, and has not been taken into account in the International Panel for \n\nClimate Change assessment reports of the geological emissions of methane \n\n(Hovland et al., 1993; I.P.C.C., 2001; Etiope, 2004; Judd, 2004). Estuaries and \n\ncoastal lagoons where the loci in the geological past for the generation of large \n\naccumulations of oil and gas now being exploited. Accumulations of shallow gas in \n\nsuch present-day systems where the volume and concentration are adequate, \n\nmay also be exploited for biogas, for local use in the near future, similarly to what \n\nis already happening in  African lakes and in artificial dairy lagoons (e.g. Williams \n\nand Frederick, 2001; Hirsch et al., 2005). Thus, understanding the importance, the \n\ncontrolling factors and the mechanisms of methane generation, accumulation and \n\nescape in coastal shallow water systems may yield useful indicators for oil and gas \n\nexploration and contribute to the evaluation of the potential of present day biogenic \n\nmethane gas in estuaries and coastal lagoons as a possible alternative energy \n\nsource. \n\nThis work was planned in order to implement methods to overcome the \n\ndifficulties with processing sub-surface data from the Ria of Aveiro, acquired at \n\n 3\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\ndifferent times. Furthermore, it aimed to investigate the seismic evidence of gas in \n\nthe sediments of coastal lagoons and the importance of understanding the \n\ncontrolling factors and the mechanisms of methane gas generation, its \n\naccumulation and escape. The work was structured around three major questions: \n\n \n\n\u2022 What are the best procedures to acquire and process the seismic \n\nreflection data in a shallow barrier-lagoon environment? \n\n\u2022 What are the types of seismic evidence of gas in the tidal channels \n\nof the Ria of Aveiro and what is the appropriate way to map them? \n\n\u2022 What are the geological controls on gas accumulation and seepage \n\nin the tidal channels of the Ria of Aveiro? \n\n \n\nThis thesis was structured to present in separate chapters a self-sufficient \n\nanswer to each of these questions. The chosen organization of the chapters \n\nallows for an efficient preparation of the work for publication in scientific journals, \n\nwhilst, at the same time, maintaining an evolving character, addressing more \n\ntechnical issues first and addressing the more theoretical issues towards the end. \n\nThe introduction, Chapter I, consists on the presentation of the nature and \n\nscope of the thesis, as well as, of the objectives and methods of the research. A \n\nmore detailed and adequate account of the state of the art and methods specific is \n\nprovided in later chapters. A general description of the study area, the Ria of \n\nAveiro, is provided in Chapter II. The next three chapters are structured as \n\nresearch papers, each one of them addressing a specific topic this thesis. The \n\nmethodological issues related to the acquisition and processing of high resolution \n\nseismic reflection data in shallow lagoons such as the Ria of Aveiro are dealt in \n\nChapter III. Chapter IV, already published as a paper in Geo-Marine Letters, \n\npresents the main types of seismic evidence of gas in the Ria of Aveiro using the \n\nEspinheiro tidal channel sector as a case study (Duarte et al., 2007). The \n\nstructural and tidal controls of gas in the Ria are discussed in Chapter V, using the \n\ndata from the Cidade Channel and the Terminal Sul. The final chapter of this work, \n\nChapter VI, presents a review of the answers to the questions that guided \n\nresearch, discusses the new issues that arose from this investigation and \n\n 4 \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n \n \n\nproposes guidelines for future work in the study of gas generation and flow in the \n\nRia of Aveiro, and in similar coastal environments. The thesis includes one \n\nAppendix with seismic evidence of gas, mainly to complement the figures of \n\nChapter IV, which were of limited number due to constraints established by the \n\nrules of its publication in Geo-Marine Letters. The appendix also serves to \n\ndocument evidence of gas in other surveyed sectors of the lagoon that were not \n\ninvestigated in detail due to the sparse seismic coverage. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.2 Objectives \n \n\nThis Ph.D. thesis studies gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of \n\nAveiro barrier-lagoon with seismic reflection data. The distribution and extent of \n\nseismic evidence of gas were mapped out in major tidal channels of the lagoon \n\nand the structural and tidal controls of gas were investigated. The specific \n\nobjectives were the following: \n\n1. To describe the data acquisition systems and to document the \n\noperational procedures used for future reference. \n\n2. To propose processing flows of the seismic signal and navigation \n\ndata and discuss the results of the application of these flows.  \n\n3. To assess the constraints imposed by the processed seismic dataset \n\non the interpretation and mapping of geological features. \n\n4. to map the high-resolution seismic evidence of gas accumulation and \n\nseepage in the sediments of the surveyed tidal channels in the \u201cRia \n\nde Aveiro\u201d barrier-lagoon \n\n5. to characterize the 3D geometry of the Holocene lagoon sediments \n\narchitecture and of the structure of the Mesozoic bedrock, allowing \n\nthe identification of structural controls on the fluid migration pathways \n\nand gas accumulation zones. \n\n6. to perform a statistical analysis of the amplitudes of the bottom \n\nreflection of the Chirp data in order to determine if there is a \n\nsignificant change in amplitude strength as the tidal cycle evolves \n\n 5\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\n1.3 Methods \n \n\nThe study of gas in the Ria of Aveiro presented here was based on very \n\nhigh-resolution 2D seismic reflection surveys (Boomer and Chirp), complemented \n\nby log data from water wells and geotechnical soundings. The seismic reflection \n\ndata acquired in the Ria of Aveiro is of multiple vintages, and the acquisition \n\nsystems used were an EG&amp;G Uniboom system with a boomer source and a \n\nDatasonics Chirp system with a modulated chirp source. High resolution seismic \n\nreflection surveying of the Ria of Aveiro started in 1986 (Monteiro and Pinheiro, \n\n1986) and a total of five surveys with Chirp and Boomer systems were carried out \n\nuntil late 2003 (Monteiro and Pinheiro, 1986; Pinheiro and Monteiro, 1999; \n\nPinheiro and Duarte, 2003a; Pinheiro and Duarte, 2003b; Pinheiro et al., 2003). \n\nThree of these surveys were done during the timeframe of this work: the Chirp \n\nsurveys RIAV02 (Pinheiro and Duarte, 2003a), RIAV02A (Pinheiro and Duarte, \n\n2003b) and the Boomer RIAV03 survey (Pinheiro et al., 2003), and the author \n\nparticipated in the latest two (RIAV02A and RIAV03); the two earliest ones, the \n\nVOUGA86 Boomer survey (Monteiro and Pinheiro, 1986) and the RIAV99 Chirp \n\nsurvey (Pinheiro and Monteiro, 1999), were revisited and also used here. The \n\nboomer data consists of approximately 65km of analog profiles and 47km of digital \n\nprofiles. The digital chirp profiles total over 200 km. Positioning of the seismic \n\nprofiles was done with GPS, DGPS and RTK-GPS systems. \n\nSeismic processing was carried out with SPW software package (Seismic \n\nProcessing Workshop, from Parallel Geoscience Corporation), and with Radex Pro \n\n(from Deco Geophysical). SEG-Y seismic data management and interpretation \n\nwas carried out using the Kingdom Suite (Seismic Micro-technology Inc) and the \n\nOpenworks and Seisworks-2D (Landmark Graphics Corporation) seismic \n\ninterpretation software packages.  \n\nThe available hydrological and geotechnical sounding log data of Ria of \n\nAveiro is relatively extensive due to the significant human occupation of the area. \n\nUnfortunately, only a couple of hydrological core logs are available close to the \n\nseismic profiles. Still, these logs are close enough to the seismic profiles to allow a \n\ncalibration of the main geological units. The geotechnical logs are mainly near \n\n 6 \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n \n \n\nharbor infrastructures in parts of the lagoon, and several are located in the \n\nneighborhood of the surveyed areas. These logs were used for the calibration of \n\nthe vertical datum of the seismic profiles and for the geological interpretation. \n\nAll available borehole, seismic and geographical data were collated into a \n\nGIS database (ArcGis, ESRI) which was used throughout this work for spatial \n\ncomputations. \n\n 7\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\n 8 \n\n\n\n Setting of the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 2. Setting of the Ria of Aveiro \n \n\n \n\nThe Ria de Aveiro is a barrier-lagoon system, located along the northwest \n\nPortuguese coast, composed of a complex network of tidal channels, tidal flats, \n\nsalt marshes and supra-tidal sand isles, separated from the sea by a sand-barrier \n\nand inlet, encompassing an area of approx. 530 km2, making it the largest coastal \n\nlagoon system in Portugal. It is located at the mouth of a drainage basin of 3,635 \n\nkm2, fed mainly by the Vouga River and its tributaries. The lagoon is a sedimentary \n\nbasin overlying a Mesozoic bedrock whose topmost sediments consist mainly of \n\nUpper Cretaceous age (Maestrichtian). These Cretaceous sediments are mainly \n\nmad up of clays also deposited in a barrier-lagoon environment. At depth, the \n\nCretaceous sequence consists of more diverse lithologies (sands, marls, and \n\nlimestones) and hosts a multilayer coastal aquifer, the Aveiro Cretaceous aquifer, \n\nwhich extends over 1,800 km2 in the Aveiro region (Condesso de Melo, 2002). \n\nThe main morphological, hydrographic, climatic, and geological features \n\nthat characterize the Ria of Aveiro are presented in the following paragraphs, in \n\norder to introduce the basic background necessary to understand the object of this \n\nstudy. Some of this information is partly revisited and further detailed in chapters \n\nIII, IV and V, tailored to the specific problems addressed in these chapters. \n\n \n\n2.1 The barrier-lagoon \n \n\nSand-barrier \n\nThe natural protection to the Ria de Aveiro lagoon is its shoreface sand \n\nbarrier system that extends for 100 km, from Espinho, to the north, to Cape \n\nMondego to the south (Fig. I-1). The sand beaches are of an intermediate dynamic \n\ndomain (between reflective and dissipative) with a prevailing unique submarine bar \n\nat water depths of less than 10 m (Teixeira, 1994). The sub-aereal segment of the \n\n 9\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\nbeaches extends for 50 to 100 m, and is commonly characterized by a frontal \n\ndune, occasionally replaced by sand dykes, that reaches 9 m above the ZH \n\n(Hidrographic Zero). Littoral drift transports sediments from the northern river \n\nbasins (e.g. Douro river basin) and feeds the beaches at the coast of the Ria de \n\nAveiro. This fluvial sediment output as been steadily decreasing for the last 200 \n\nyears (Teixeira, 1994), and, nowadays, the Ria of Aveiro shoreline suffers from \n\nsedimentary deficit, particularly to the south of the lagoon inlet where significant \n\nshoreline retreat is occurring (Baptista et al., 2002). \n\n \n\nInlet \n\nThe lagoon communicates with the Atlantic Ocean via a dynamic inlet that \n\nsuffered significant migration in the last 1000. By the late XVIII century the inlet \n\nwas mostly closed and communication with the Atlantic interrupted (see the \n\nevolution of the Ria of Aveiro in Fig. II-1). Only after extensive engineering work at \n\nthe inlet from the early XIX century until 1950s did the inlet acquire self-regulating \n\ncapacity; with episodes of shoaling reducing the channel section causing \n\nincreased current velocities and consequent greater erosion and, conversely, \n\nepisodes of greater erosion increasing the channel section causing a decrease in \n\ncurrent velocities, sediment deposition and shoaling (Abecasis, 1954; Teixeira, \n\n1994; da Silva and Duck, 2001).  \n\n \n\nTidal channels \n\nThe inner lagoon is composed by a network of tidal channels that crisscross \n\nextensive tidal flats and salt marshes. The tidal channels are the deepest \n\nmorphological elements of the lagoon, and distribute the tidal prism to the interior \n\nof the lagoon (see the main tidal channels location in Fig. II-2). A local terminology \n\ndescribes the hierarchy of the hydrographic network: first order channels, also \n\ncalled \u201cCales\u201d, are always immerse and, generally, become deeper closer to the \n\ninlet; second order channels, called \u201dEsteiros\u201d, promote the connection between \n\n\u201dCales\u201d, isolate inner isles and almost dry up during more extreme low tides (e.g. \n\nneap tides); third order channels or \u201dRegueiros\u201d, make up the incipient network \n\nover the tidal flats and salt marshes; they undergo considerable emersion and are \n\n 10 \n\n\n\n Setting of the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\nusually only totally flooded during the second half of the flooding (Teixeira, 1994).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure II-1: Evolution of the Ria of Aveiro since Xth century to present day (a colored version by an \nunknown author of the black and white original from Abecasis, 1954). \n\n \n \n\n \n\nTidal flats \n\nThe tidal flats correspond to sandy to muddy deposits neighboring the tidal \n\nchannels that emerge during low tide and submerge during the highest tides \n\n(Klein, 1967; Woodroffe, 2003). Teixeira (1994) described the three main evolution \n\nmechanisms for the tidal flats of the Ria de Aveiro. \n\n \n\n1. Natural differentiation of tidal flats from the marginal deposits of tidal \n\nchannels is the primary mechanism for the generation of tidal flats. Margin \n\nsediments are reworked by changing tides forming flat surfaces which are \n\ndrained by an incipient runoff channel network, and dip slightly towards the \n\ntidal channels. \n\n 11\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\n \nFigure II-2: Location of the main tidal channels of the Ria of Aveiro. \n\n \n\n 12 \n\n\n\n Setting of the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\n2. Increasing tidal amplitudes during the second half of the 20th century are \n\nresponsible for the majority of the tidal flats in the Ria de Aveiro (Teixeira \n\n94). This process increases channel bottom erosion, steepens channel \n\nmargins and favors marsh levee construction, frequently colonized by \n\nSpartina. In this case tidal flats are formed from levee reworking. \n\n3. The increase in tidal amplitudes sometimes causes the formation confined \n\nbasins dominated by tidal flats. This confinement is accomplished within an \n\narea delimited by connected tidal channels through marsh levee buildup, as \n\ndescribed in point 2. The levees only allow inundation to occur near high \n\ntide, when most sediment transport occurs through suspension, causing the \n\nshoaling of these basins with flattened fine sediment deposits. \n\n \n\nSalt marshes \n\nThe salt marshes are upper intertidal environments of mostly muddy \n\nsediments covered by a variety of halophyte vegetation (salt tolerant). They can be \n\nsub-divided in upper and lower salt marshes according to their degree of emersion \n\nwhich, in turn, determines flora distribution. The lower salt marshes are \n\ncharacterized by relatively higher salinity and longer periods of emersion, whereas \n\nthe upper salt marshes are characterized by lower salinity and better oxygenation. \n\nTeixeira (1994) presents a case study illustrating the speed of the evolution of salt \n\nmarshes in the Ria de Aveiro, where a tidal flat evolved to a salt marsh in \n\napproximately one century, indicating sedimentation rates of approximately 1.0 \n\ncm/year. The upper marshes comprise 90% of all marshes of the Ria de Aveiro, \n\ncover approximately 35% of the intra-lagoon space, and most of the marsh \n\ndeposits were already in place by late XVIth century (Teixeira, 1994). \n\n \n\n2.2 Climate and river discharge \nThe climate of the Aveiro region is characterized by a prevalence of \n\nwesterly winds during the winter which induce instability and precipitation.  Arid \n\nconditions prevail during the summer due to the northwards movement of the \n\nNorth Atlantic anti-cyclone, which carries with it the precipitation front. Thus, winter \n\n 13\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\nprecipitation tends to be three times larger than the precipitation during the \n\nsummer. \n\nAverage temperature fluctuates between 6\u00baC during the winter and 20\u00baC \n\nduring the summer (Faria and Machado, 1979; Rebelo, 1992). Average annual \n\nprecipitation in the lagoon is about 1000mm, and, usually, the October-March \n\nperiod receives ca. 75% of the annual precipitation and the summer trimester only \n\nreceives 5%. The total drainage network that feeds the Ria of Aveiro is of 3109 \n\nKm2 and includes nine hydrographic basins: 1 - Ovar creek; 2 -  Antu\u00e3 river; 3 - \n\nVouga river; 4 - Angeja creeks; 5 - Aveiro creeks; 6 \u2013 \u00c1gueda river; 7 - Boco river; \n\n8 - C\u00e9rtima river; 9 \u2013 Mira river (see Fig. II-3). According to Loureiro et al. (1986) \n\npotential evapotranspiration of the Ria de Aveiro basin is of 730 mm, i.e. smaller \n\nthan the average precipitation in the same area. \n\nThe annual surface runoff to the Ria de Aveiro lagoon is approximately 2.0 \n\nkm3, corresponding to an average output of 1.37x106 m3 for each half tidal cycle \n\n(6h) (Teixeira, 1994). It should be noted that there are strong asymmetries in the \n\nrunoff during the year, with the average annual runoff being approximately one \n\ntenth of the maximum annual runoff. \n\nWind regime in the Ria de Aveiro is dependent on the dynamics of the \n\nAzores anticyclonic cell (Fi\u00faza et al., 1982). The regime of steady northerly winds \n\nduring the summer changes to more volatile conditions during the winter with \n\nfrequent changes in wind direction. The thermal gradient between the ocean and \n\ncontinent, that changes with the day and night cycle, causes a local breeze climate \n\nthat overprints the annual wind regime. Typically, daytime is marked by a westerly \n\nto northwesterly wind, which becomes increasingly stronger towards the afternoon. \n\nDuring the night, the winds rotate, blowing from the east to southeast, usually with \n\nlower velocity than during the day. The local wind regime is more obvious during \n\nthe summer, when the regional wind regime is weaker. \n\n \n\n2.3 Hidrography \nThe tide is the main forcing factor inside the lagoon. The tidal currents \n\nmobilize and distribute the sediments, producing the tidal flats and feeding the \n\n 14 \n\n\n\n Setting of the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\nsediments to the marsh. The tidal flooding carves an internal channel network and \n\ncarries marine salt into the lagoon. Tides are predominantly semi-diurnal, with an \n\naverage amplitude at the inlet of 1.90 m, ranging between 1.22 m and 2.57 m, \n\nduring neap and spring tides respectively (Teixeira, 1994). The tidal amplitude \n\ndecreases with the distance from the inlet, but it is present in the entire lagoon. \n\nThe phase lag, variable in high and low water, increases upstream up to 5 hours, \n\nwith low and high tides sometimes occurring simultaneously in different parts of \n\nthe lagoon (Dias et al., 2000a). Water volume at low spring tides is 65 hm3 and the \n\ntidal prism at spring tides is about 80 hm3, with an estimated time of residence of \n\nthe water of three days (Teixeira, 1994). The tidal prism has gradually increased \n\nsince the beginning of the century due to the engineering work done on the inlet. \n\nAccording to Teixeira (1994, and work referred therein), from 1900 to 1930 the \n\nspring tide tidal prism should not have been larger than 25x106 m3, and the neap \n\ntide tidal prism half of this value. As the inlet and tidal channels stabilized with the \n\nengineering works post 1930, gradually the tidal prism increased by 1x106 m3 per \n\nyear to the actual values and marine invasion spread into the lagoon (see Fig. II-\n\n4). Also, the tidal prism is significantly larger than the fluvial input to the lagoon, \n\nwith the fluvial input being only equal to the volume of the prism of neap tides for \n\none tide every 5 years. \n\n \nFigure II-3: Hydrographic basins of the Ria of Aveiro (adapted from Teixeira, 1994). \n\n 15\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure II-4: Tidal prism evolution of the Ria of Aveiro in the last 125 years (Teixeira, 1994). \n\n \n\n \n\nThe tidal prism is distributed asymmetrically into the lagoon; the Mira \n\nchannel to the south of the inlet receives 10% of tidal prism volume, whereas the \n\nthree subsidiary channels of the main navigation channel, S.Jacinto, Espinheiro \n\nand Cidade, receive respectively 34, 34 and 12% of the prism and the remaining \n\n10% occupy the surface of the common channel (Teixeira, 1994). \n\nThe offshore wave agitation is related to the North Atlantic wind regime, \n\nwith predominant directions from the North during the summer, and with \n\nincreasingly varying directions as the winter progresses. The modal and average \n\nwave origin direction is from WNW and maximum wave heights decrease as the \n\nwave origin direction rotates to the NW. The observed wave period ranges from 6s \n\nto 18 s, with a modal value around 9-11 s, for every wave direction. The average \n\nwave height is 2 m and approximately 35% of waves recorded during a year have \n\ngreater heights. According to Teixeira (1994), three quarters of the sediment \n\ntransport is carried by waves lower than 6 m, whereas storm conditions are only \n\nresponsible for 20% of the sediment transport. Wave conditions at the shoreface \n\nof the Ria de Aveiro are relatively stable due to the fact that the relatively smooth \n\nwater bottom and linear coastline preclude the occurrence of preferential locations \n\nfor wave energy concentration (Abecasis et al., 1968).  \n\n 16 \n\n\n\n Setting of the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\nThe Ria of Aveiro functions as a well mixed estuary close to the inlet, and \n\nprogressively behaves as a more stratified estuary upstream. During high tide, the \n\nsalinity is maximum, and falls during ebb until it reaches minimum value at low \n\ntide, with a resultant residual salt transport into the lagoon (Matos, 1990). Salinity \n\nvalues are typically high, around 3.5%, comparable to marine salinity, under the \n\nmore common conditions of low fluvial runoff (Teixeira, 1994). As with the tidal \n\nprism, and for the same reasons (i.e. changes in the inlet), the salinity regime in \n\nthe lagoon was significantly different in the beginning of the century, with high \n\nsalinity limited to the proximity of the inlet and to the lower water layer up to \n\nS.Jacinto channel (Nobre, 1915 in Teixeira, 1994).  \n\nThe analysis of previous work on the tidal and salinity regimes of the lagoon \n\nallowed Teixeira (1994) to conclude that the work on the Aveiro inlet during the \n\n1950s significantly altered the hydraulic regime of the lagoon: \u201cThe tidal amplitude \n\nand the daily water outflow nearly doubled at the inlet. As a consequence, the \n\nrelative importance of the fluvial debit contracted, allowing the appearance and \n\nexpansion of the sedimentary environments of lagoon zones. The Ria de Aveiro, \n\nthat, during the last centuries, had the common attributes of an estuarine \n\nenvironment, literally grow, and, from 1950 onwards, became a genuine coastal \n\nlagoon (translated from the original).\u201d \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4 Geological framework \n \n\nThe Ria of Aveiro is a Holocene sedimentary basin located in the \n\nnorthernmost part of the Lusitanian basin, a rift-basin formed during the Mesozoic \n\nopening of the North Atlantic Ocean. The basement underlying the Lusitanian \n\nbasin is the Variscan orogen, mainly made up of igneous and sedimentary rocks \n\nmetamorphosed during the Paleozoic (see geological map of the region in Fig. II-\n\n5). The geodynamic evolution of the Ria of Aveiro region reflects the major \n\nextensional and compressional events caused by the relative movements of the \n\nEurasia, Africa and Iberia from Triassic till the Present (for an overview of the \n\ngeodynamic evolution of the Iberian Peninsula see Andeweg, 2002) . \n\n 17\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure II-5: Geological map of the Aveiro region  (from the Geological Map of Portugal 1:500.000; \nOliveira et al., 1992). \n\n \n\nThe Western Iberian margin experienced two major stages of rifting \n\nseparated by periods of quiescence, from the Triassic to the Cretaceous, which \n\nstrongly controlled the stratigraphy and tectonic evolution of the Meso-Cenozoic \n\nsedimentary basins of the Portuguese continental margin (Boillot et al., 1979; \n\nRibeiro et al., 1979; Vanney and Mougenot, 1981; Uchupi, 1988; Wilson et al., \n\n1989; Pinheiro et al., 1996; Rasmussen et al., 1998; Andeweg, 2002; Alves et al., \n\n2003b). Folds and thrusts within the Hercynian basement trend NW-SE, at an \n\nangle to the NNE-SSW trend of the main Lusitanian rift faults. Various NNE-SSW \n\nleft-lateral strike-slip faults, formed during the late Variscan fracturing event of \n\nPermian age faults, functioned as rift half-graben faults, defining syn-rift fluvial \n\n 18 \n\n\n\n Setting of the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\nclastic depocenters. These faults were also later reactivated with strike-slip \n\nmovement, during the Tertiary Alpine orogenesis (Uphoff et al., 2002). \n\nThe first rifting stage occurred during Late Triassic to Early Jurassic. The \n\nimportant regional hiatus that follows the Early Jurassic rifting is probably related \n\nto the opening of the Central Atlantic Ocean, for it coincides with the beginning of \n\noceanic spreading at the Iberian Abyssal plain at 126 Ma  (Whitmarsh and Miles, \n\n1995).  \n\nTwo other extensional phases are described, one during the Late Jurassic \n\nand another during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous (Wilson et al., 1989; \n\nRasmussen et al., 1998). These phases of deformation were more pronounced in \n\nouter basins of the Western Iberian Margin and the Lusitanian basin became part \n\nof an aborted rift with relatively limited subsidence since then. Regional uplift \n\noccurred during the Callovian to Early Oxfordian and, in the Lusitanian basin, this \n\nwas followed by fault-block rotation and rapid subsidence along NNE-SSW \n\ntrending faults during Late-Oxfordian-Earliest Kimeridgian. \n\nDuring the Early Cretaceous the Lusitanian basin sedimentation was \n\ncharacteristic of a post-rift regime (Dinis et al., 2008). Fault controlled subsidence \n\nand halokinesis determined the deposition of a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic \n\nsystem. The sedimentation changed laterally from shallow carbonates in \n\ntopographic highs to fluvial-deltaic siliciclastic deposits close to the water lines, \n\nwhich gradually passed to marine shale and limestones towards the deeper parts \n\nof the basin (Bernardes, 1992). \n\nIn sharp contrast with the Mesozoic, the Cenozoic in the Western Iberia is \n\ncharacterized by periods of compressional deformation related to the Pyrenean \n\nand Alpine orogenies. The closure of the Bay of Biscay-Piyrenean zone migrated \n\nto the west and caused the inversion of the Mesozoic extensional basins (Garcia \n\nMondejar, 1988). The short-lived southward subduction of the oceanic crust in the \n\nBiscay region during the latest Cretaceous to Early Eocene (Boillot and Mallod, \n\n1988) formed the Cantabrian Cordillera in the north of the Iberia. Sedimentation in \n\nthe Lusitanian basin during the Pyrenean compression was controlled by pre-\n\nexisting late Variscan basement faults, often amplified by halokinesis, sometimes \n\nleading to the formation of diapirs that pierced the entire sedimentary cover (Alves \n\n 19\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\net al., 2003a). \n\nSedimentation during the Paleogene consisted mostly of sands and \n\nconglomerates, while in the Neogene, sedimentation evolved to shallow marine \n\nclastic and carbonate deposits due to subsidence and marine transgression. The \n\nNNW-SSE compression was mostly accommodated by ENE-WSW thrusts and by \n\npre-existing NNE-SSW and NW-SE faults. \n\nThe main NNW convergence between Africa and Eurasia changed to NW in \n\nTortonian, and triggered the build up of the Betic range. The end of the frontal \n\nconvergence of Iberia and Eurasia around 30 Ma also marked the activation of the \n\nright lateral Azores-Gibraltar plate boundary (Srivastava et al., 1990).  \n\nAccording to a review by Andeweg (2002), the whole of Iberia exhibits high \n\nlevel of internal deformation during the Plio-Pleistocene, evidenced by crustal \n\nscale folding (Cloetingh et al., 2002), large scale Pliocene uplift of several \n\nhundreds of meters in coastal areas (Janssen et al., 1993), present day seismicity \n\n(Buforn et al., 1988) and the development of new crustal shear zones in the \n\nAlboran basin (Andeweg, 2001) as well as south of Portugal in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n(Rosas et al., 2008; Zitellini et al., 2009). All this evidence records the ongoing \n\nconvergence between Africa and Iberia (Argus et al., 1989). In the North \n\nLusitanian basin, Pliocene sedimentation recorded multiple transgression and \n\nregression cycles. Several erosional surfaces developed during the Quaternary, \n\nand deposition consisted mainly of coarse sand and gravel, often affected by mild \n\nneotectonic movements (Rocha, 1993; Granja et al., 1999; Dinis, 2004). \n\nRecently compiled evidence in Western Iberia of regional progressive \n\nrotation of the compression direction (S-Hmax), from NNW-SSE to WNW-ESE, \n\nsince the upper Pliocene the led Ribeiro et al. (1996; 2002) to propose the \n\nhypothesis that a North Atlantic westwards subduction is initiating in the western \n\nIberian margin, marking a major shift of plate dynamics in the region.  \n\n \n\nLithostratigraphy \n\nThe lithostratigraphy of the Aveiro region comprehends, from bottom to top, \n\nProterozoic-Paleozoic Variscan metasediments and plutonic rocks, followed by \n\nMesozoic Atlantic-rift deposits, culminating in Pleisto-Holocene estuarine and \n\n 20 \n\n\n\n Setting of the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\nlagoon sediments (see synopsis of the lithostratigrapy in Table II-1). Rocha (1993) \n\npoints out the occurrence of Tertiary \u201crelics\u201d in the geological logs of boreholes \n\ndrilled along the Aveiro littoral, between the villages of Gafanha and Muranzel. \n\nThis section provides a short lithostratigraphic account of these rocks with \n\nemphasis on the Upper Cretaceous and Quaternary sedimentary units, which, as \n\nwill be explained in future chapters, are of particular relevance for this work. \n\nThe Variscan bedrock consists of mica schists and schists of Proterozoic \n\nage, with occasional Proterozoic gneisses, migmatites and Paleozoic granitoids in \n\nthe northern part of the Aveiro region. It is exposed close to the Porto-Tomar fault, \n\nalong a NNW-SSE trend, east of the Ria of Aveiro. The basement dips westward \n\nand is faulted by N-S and NNE-SSW faults, forming a system of horsts and \n\ngrabens. \n\nThe onshore and offshore stratigraphy of the Lusitanian basin has been \n\ninvestigated by multiple authors (e.g. Berthou, 1973; Teixeira and Zbyszewski, \n\n1976; Berthou and Lauverjat, 1979; Boillot et al., 1979; Ribeiro et al., 1979; \n\nBarbosa, 1981; Vanney and Mougenot, 1981; Wilson et al., 1989; Bernardes, \n\n1992; Rocha, 1993; Alves et al., 2003a; Dinis et al., 2008). The Ria of Aveiro \n\nregion corresponds to the northernmost part of the \u201cBeira Litoral\u201d sub-basin of the \n\nLusitanian basin. It is characterized by two significant hiatus in the stratigraphic \n\nsequence during the Carixian-Aptian and Late Cretaceous-Pliocene. \n\nThe Mesozoic lithostratigraphy ranges from the Upper Triassic, Rhaetian \n\nstage, red marly-clayey sandstones of the \u201cGr\u00e9s de Eirol\u201d formation, to the clays, \n\nmarly clays and carbonates of the Upper Cretaceous, Campanian-Maastrichtian \n\nstage, \u201cArgilas de Aveiro\u201d formation (see synopsis in Table II-1). \n\nThe \u201cArgilas de Aveiro\u201d formation is of particular interest for this work \n\nbecause the Pleisto-Holocene sediments of the Ria of Aveiro frequently occur \n\ndirectly on top of it. The \u201cArgilas de Aveiro\u201d formation consists of the grayish marly \n\nclays, with occasional important sand content and with marly limestone layers \n\ndeposited during a long regression in temperate climate. Towards the base, \n\nsediments become gradually coarser marly-sands, with bottom deposits mostly of \n\nsandstones. Clay mineralogy is very homogenous, dominated by illite followed by \n\ncalcium smectite (Rocha and Gomes, 1989). \n\n 21\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\nTable II-1: Synopsys of the lithostratigraphy in the north part of Aveiro region (from Condesso \nMelo, 2002) \n\n \n \n\nThe unit is roughly uniform in the Aveiro region, with thicknesses over 150 m near \n\nthe coast. Bernardes (1987) defined four facies associations of a coastal plain \n\nsystem for the Argilas de Aveiro formation. Association I corresponds to subtidal \n\nconditions of a barrier-lagoon complex, with central and marginal lagoon deposits \n\nas well as washover deposits. Association II deposited in intertidal conditions, \n\nconsists of mud flat deposits with recurrent exposure and inundation periods. \n\nAssociation III includes sandy deposits of high sinuosity tidal channels, small tidal \n\ncreeks with simple architecture and larger and more complex tidal inlets. \n\nAssociation IV deposited in supratidal conditions, with sedimentation governed by \n\nvegetation colonization. \n\nThe Pliocene, Pleistocene and Holocene deposits are mainly recent alluvial \n\nand sand dunes of Holocene age, old beach deposits and fluvial terraces of \n\n 22 \n\n\n\n Setting of the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\nPleistocene age (mainly clays and clayey sands in the upper part and coarse \n\nsands and pebbles at the bottom). Lagoon sedimentation occurs over a marine \n\nravinement surface related to the Holocene marine transgression (see Dias et al., \n\n2000b for a synthesis on coastal evolution and marine transgression in Portugal). \n\nInvestigation of the sediment record in the sand barrier has provided some insights \n\non the onset and development of estuarine and lagoonal sedimentation in the Ria \n\nof Aveiro. Galera et al (1997) described three minor sedimentation cycles in the \n\nMira channel related to the last 1000 years: 1) \u201cAncient Cycle\u201d of estuarine \n\nsedimentation of muddy facies, prior to the 16th century; 2) \u201cRecent cycle\u201d of \n\nsubtidal channel deposits of sands and intertidal mudstones and tidal sand bars; \n\n3) \u201cPresent cycle\u201d sedimentation of subtidal channel sands and mudstones related \n\nto the opening of the artificial inlet. A more recent study of the sand spit evolution \n\nbetween Torreira and Furadouro, the northern branch of the sand-barrier \n\n(Bernardes and Rocha, 2007), also describes three sedimentary units which may \n\nin part correlate with the sedimentation cycles described by Galera (1997): a lower \n\nunit of estuarine lagoonal deposits developed in retrograding conditions of \n\nstationary sea level which indicates the lagoon was formed prior to 1997-1992 \n\nyears BP; a middle unit related to landwards prograding sand ridges, possibly \n\nassociated with minor sea level rise; and an upper dune unit related to a period of \n\nshoreline stability. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.5 Gas in the Lagoon \n \n\nEarly descriptions of possibly methane gas related phenomena in the \n\nlagoon area date back to the 1755 great Lisbon earthquake. The answers from \n\nlocal parishes to the Marqu\u00eas de Pombal enquiries on the 1755 earthquake report \n\nthat the Vouga river waters \u201cboiled as if they were on fire\u201d and that the waters from \n\nthe Mira lagoon (at the south end of the Ria) \u201cappeared to boil so hard that they \n\nwould break at the lagoon shore as if they were sea waves\u201d (Coelho, 2005; \n\nOliveira, 2005); these tales may be explained by gas releases from seismically \n\ndestabilized sediments. The first unequivocal direct observations of escape of \n\n 23\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\nbiogenic methane from several drill holes in Quaternary sediments from the area \n\nsurrounding the Ria of Aveiro were reported by the Portuguese Geological Survey \n\nin 1967 (Faria et al., 1967). Since then, similar evidence has been observed in \n\nother land wells for water exploration. During previous work, Duarte et al. (2003) \n\nidentified several high-backscatter patches on sidescan sonar images acquired in \n\nthe Ria de Aveiro by the Portuguese Hydrographic Institute in 1998, which they \n\ninterpreted as related to gas escape. Recently, in September of 2006, gas \n\nsamples were collected from extensive bubble trains observed during falling tide in \n\na docking pier (\u201cDoca Pesca\u201d) in the Ria of Aveiro (Pinheiro and Duarte, 2006, \n\nunpublished data). The analysis of the samples revealed that the gas composition \n\nwas mostly methane (Luis Pinheiro and Jo\u00e3o Coutinho, personal communication). \n\n 24 \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M.

Examples from the Ria of Aveiro, a shallow barrier lagoon located in \n\nNW Portugal, are shown. The main limitations are: ship traffic, tides and channel \n\nmorphology and bathymetry, which often affect the deployment and operation of \n\nthe seismic systems, and the extent of the profile coverage. The processing of the \n\nnavigation data included data errors detection, system clock synchronization \n\ncorrections, layback adjustment and trace midpoint position estimation. The \n\nseismic signal processing consisted in amplitude corrections, burst noise removal, \n\nstatic corrections, normal move-out corrections, frequency band pass filtering, \n\nsignature deconvolution and migration. The analysis of the track line regularity, the \n\nhorizon misties and the first-break surface models were applied as quality control \n\nprocedures, and allowed the revision and improvement of the processing \n\nparameters. The heterogeneity of the seismic coverage, signal quality, penetration \n\nand resolution all constrain the use of the data to mostly local but detailed \n\ninterpretations of the geological objects of the Ria of Aveiro. A new procedure is \n\nproposed to determine adequate scales for the geological interpretation based on \n\nthe seismic resolution, known positioning errors and mean mistie values.  \n\n 25\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\n 26 \n\n3.1. Introduction \n \n\n3.1.1. Objectives \n\nThe present work addresses the methodological problems faced in the \n\nstudy of the bedrock structure and sediment architecture in shallow water \n\nestuarine and lagoon systems using very high-resolution 2-D seismic reflection \n\nsystems (Boomer and Chirp). A case study of the Ria of Aveiro barrier lagoon \n\n(Portugal) is presented. The study of the bedrock structure and sediment \n\narchitecture with seismic reflection methods requires adequate and reliable \n\nseismic imaging of the geological features. For this purpose, a precise control of \n\nthe seismic data acquisition conditions and of the accuracy in the positioning is \n\nessential. Data processing is frequently necessary to improve positioning quality, \n\nas well as to enhance the interpretability of the seismic signal.  \n\nThe persecution of such broad methodological goals in this study met with \n\nan uncommon conjunction of obstacles for the case of the Ria of Aveiro. The \n\nseismic reflection data acquired in the Ria of Aveiro is of multiple vintages, with \n\nvarious acquisition systems, navigation systems and operational procedures and \n\nconditions. Various characteristics of the Ria of Aveiro further constrained the \n\nseismic acquisition, affecting signal quality, the systems deployment geometry and \n\nthe characteristics of the seismic coverage. Variable and frequently high current \n\nspeeds caused by tides and winds affected signal quality due to turbulence \n\ncaused by drag effects on the towed equipment; the system geometry was \n\naffected by frequent changes of ship direction due to the abundant navigation \n\nhazards (e.g. fishing nets, ship traffic, etc) that are common in the lagoon; also, \n\nthe 2 meter tidal range and several hours tidal lag inside the lagoon caused a \n\nconstant and difficult to control change in the vertical datum of the seismic data. \n\nThe very shallow waters in most of the lagoon meant that seismic acquisition was \n\nlimited to the deeper, navigable, tidal channels, and that the seismic coverage was \n\nvery irregular within the lagoon.  \n\nIn order to address these problems the following specific objectives of this \n\npaper are: \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M. (to be submitted) \u2013 seismic reflection in shallow environments \n \n \n\n1. To describe the data acquisition systems and to document the operational \n\nprocedures used. \n\n2. To propose specially tailored data processing flows of the seismic signal \n\nand navigation data and to discuss the results of the application of these \n\nflows to the available data.  \n\n3. To assess the constraints imposed by the processed seismic dataset on the \n\ninterpretation and mapping of geological features. \n\n \n\n3.1.2. State of the art \n\nHigh resolution seismic reflection surveying of the Ria of Aveiro started in \n\n1986 (Monteiro and Pinheiro, 1986; Moreira, 1988; Teixeira and Pinheiro, 1998) \n\nand a total of five surveys with Chirp and Boomer systems were carried out until \n\nlate 2003. Three of these surveys were done in the scope of this project and data \n\nfrom earlier surveys were revisited and also discussed here. Most of the \n\npublications from other high resolution seismic reflection surveys conducted in \n\nsomewhat similar systems, conditions and environments such as the Venice \n\nlagoon (McClennen et al., 1997; Zechhin et al., 2008)  and the Rias Bajas of \n\nGalicia (Ferrin et al., 2003; Garcia-Gil, 2003), do not address in detail the data \n\nacquisition and processing challenges of acquiring high resolution data in very \n\nshallow coastal environments. \n\nA seismic survey of a sub-tidal to intra-tidal area in the Bay of Fundy, \n\nCanada, bypassed a significant part of the navigation and geometry control \n\nproblems addressed in this work through technical innovations of the seismic \n\nacquisition systems (Dashtgard et al., 2007). The authors of that study used a \n\nboomer system that had its signal source mounted together with the receiver array \n\nin a single catamaran, which simplified the deployment geometry, and also \n\nresorted to RTK-GPS to infer tidal heights with centimeter precision.  \n\nResearch in very high-resolution 3-D seismic reflection systems is the \n\ncurrent field of study where the issue of the relationships between shallow water \n\nseismic acquisition and processing and the characteristics of the study object has \n\nhad more attention. Marsset et al. (1998) have emphasized the importance of tidal \n\n 27\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\ncorrection in shallow coastal environments in order to improve the correlation \n\nbetween profiles. Missiaen  (2005) provides insights on how the work in shallow \n\nwater environments and at high frequencies implies constraints on sampling, array \n\ndirectivity and positioning accuracy, constraints that are in good part also found in \n\nthe work in the Ria of Aveiro. An example of how to tackle the challenges in \n\npositioning of 3-D seismics that deals with issues such as data quality control and \n\nnavigation and seismic systems integration, which are also present in this work, \n\ncan be found in the technical report of a 3-D seismic survey in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n(Duarte, 2006).  \n\nGeneral signal processing workflows for single and multi channel seismics \n\ncan be found in multiple books (e.g. Yilmaz, 1987; Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). \n\nProposed processing flows for chirp systems generally consist of match filtering, \n\nHilbert transform and instantaneous amplitude computation (for reviews on chirp \n\nprocessing see Quinn et al., 1998; Henkart, 2006). Published boomer signal \n\nprocessing flows typically include static corrections to compensate for swell and/or \n\ntides, spherical divergence correction, frequency bandpass filtering, spike \n\ndeconvolution and, occasionally, a constant velocity time migration (Dashtgard et \n\nal., 2007). \n\n3.1.3. Seismic surveying and the hydrography of the Ria \n\nof Aveiro \n\nThe seismic reflection acquisition in the Ria of Aveiro was significantly \n\ncontrolled by morphological characteristics of the navigable waterways, as well as \n\nby its tidal and current patterns. The Ria of Aveiro is composed by an intricate \n\nnetwork of tidal channels that crisscross extensive mud flats and salt marshes \n\n(see Fig. III-1). The tidal channels correspond to the deeper lagoon segments \n\nthrough which the tidal prism is distributed to the interior of the lagoon.  A local \n\nnomenclature describes the hierarchy of the hydrographic network: first order \n\nchannels, also called \u201cCales\u201d, are always immersed and, generally, become \n\ndeeper closer to the only inlet of the lagoon barrier; the second order channels, \n\ncalled \u201cEsteiros\u201d, promote the connection between different \u201cCales\u201d, isolate inner \n\nisles and almost dry up during more extreme low tides (e.g. neap tides); third order \n\n 28 \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M. (to be submitted) \u2013 seismic reflection in shallow environments \n \n \n\nchannels, or \u201cRegueiros\u201d, make up the inicipient network over the tidal flats and \n\nsalt marshes, undergo considerable emersion and are usually only totally flooded \n\nduring the second half of the flooding (Teixeira, 1994).  \n\nThe tidal flats correspond to flattened deposits neighboring the tidal \n\nchannels that occur at depths between spring low tide altitude and the average \n\ntidal altitude. The upper limit corresponds to the surface marking predominant \n\nemersion and coincides with the minimal altitude for the halofite colonizations, \n\ntypically Spartina (Teixeira, 1994). The salt marshes are upper intertidal \n\nenvironments of mostly muddy sediments covered by a variety of halofite \n\nvegetation (salt tolerant).  \n\nAs the surface area of the Ria of Aveiro consists predominantly of tidal flats \n\nand salt marshes (over three quarters of the lagoon area), seismic coverage of the \n\nlagoon was spatially constrained, for it was limited to the deeper tidal channels. \n\nThe first order, navigable tidal channels, where most of the Aveiro harbor facilities \n\nare located, suffer from heavy cargo ship traffic. This heavy traffic coupled with the \n\nabundant fishing nets deployed haphazardly, sometimes with poor signalization, \n\nconstituted serious navigation hazards during acquisition and were the cause of \n\nmultiple trackline irregularities. Also, hydrographic surveys were not available \n\noutside the main harbor area and navigation channels, and all the surveying into \n\nthose areas required careful monitoring of the water depth. Still, even with great \n\ncare, the towed equipment was accidently grounded a couple of times. Success in \n\nnavigating the uncharted waters was due to the vast experience and personal \n\nknowledge of the lagoon of the harbor pilots that commanded the survey vessels. \n\nTides in the Ria of Aveiro are predominantly semi-diurnal, with an average \n\namplitude at the inlet of 1.90 m, ranging between 1.22 m and 2.57 m, during neap \n\nand spring tides respectively (Teixeira, 1994). The tidal amplitude decreases with \n\nthe distance from the inlet, but it is present in the entire lagoon. The phase lag, \n\nvariable in high and low water, increases upstream up to 5 hours, with low and \n\nhigh tides sometimes occurring simultaneously in different parts of the lagoon \n\n(Dias et al., 2000). Available tide prediction data had to be used to control this \n\ncomplex tidal behavior, because no altitude data was recorded during acquisition \n\n(see tide prediction locations in Fig. III-1). \n\n 29\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\n \n\nFigure III-1: Hidrography of the Ria of Aveiro. Labeled locations indicate the name of the tide \nprediction stations, followed by the estimated delay of the low tide during spring tides, according to \nthe tide table of the Aveiro harbor Authorities (APA). \n\n 30 \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M. (to be submitted) \u2013 seismic reflection in shallow environments \n \n \n\nThe strong influence of tides in the lagoon was particularly felt during ebb \n\nwhen current speeds could reach up to 5 knots closer to the inlet. Such strong \n\ncurrents caused significant difficulties in handling the ship at the low survey \n\nspeeds (normally 4-5 knots). Navigation against the tide caused increased drag on \n\nthe towed equipment, and the turbulence produced noise was recorded by the \n\nseismic systems. On the other hand, navigation with the tide direction sometimes \n\ncaused the equipment to lose its planned deployment geometry because current \n\nspeeds closely matched surveying speeds. \n\nCurrents in the Ria of Aveiro are also sometimes significantly influenced by \n\nwinds. The Ria of Aveiro has a regime of steady northerly winds during the \n\nsummer that changes to more volatile conditions during the winter, with frequent \n\nchanges in wind direction. Typically, daytime is marked by a westerly to \n\nnorthwesterly wind, which becomes increasingly stronger towards the afternoon \n\n(Teixeira, 1994). The stronger afternoon wind promoted stronger currents and \n\nturbulence in the upper water layer, which introduced noise to the seismic records. \n\nThe worst surveying conditions occur when a strong afternoon wind coincides with \n\nan ebbing tide close to the lagoon inlet. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2. Methods and data \n \n\nThe seismic data used in this work was acquired between 1986 and 2003 \n\n(Monteiro and Pinheiro, 1986; Pinheiro and Monteiro, 1999; Pinheiro and Duarte, \n\n2003a; Pinheiro and Duarte, 2003b; Pinheiro et al., 2003). Naturally, the seismic \n\nand navigation systems deployed and modes of operation were specific to each \n\nsurvey and evolved through time. This chapter presents the data acquisition \n\nsystems and the geometry parameters that describe their deployment which are \n\nrelevant for data processing. This is followed by the technical summary specific to \n\neach survey, including objectives, equipment and operational details. Finally, the \n\ndata quality control protocol is described, and the navigation and seismic signal \n\nprocessing flows explained. \n\n 31\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\n3.2.1. Data acquisition systems \nThe seismic data acquisition systems in this work were an EG&amp;G Uniboom \n\nsystem with a boomer source and a Datasonics Chirp Sonar system with a \n\nmodulated chirp source. In broad terms, these systems comprise an energy \n\nsource that powers a signal source, a hydrophone receiver array and  a recording \n\nunit (for an overview on high resolution seismic reflection systems see Mosher and \n\nSimpkin, 1999).  \n\n \nThe EG&amp;G Uniboom system (Boomer) \n\nThe EG&amp;G 230-1 UNIBOOM (Unit Pulse Boomer) is a high resolution \n\nseismic reflection system with a boomer source which has a signal frequency \n\nbandwidth ranging from 400 to 14000 Hz. This boomer unit has three modes of \n\noperation: 700-14000 Hz and a maximum of 6 pings per second (pps) for 100 \n\nwatt-second energy level; 500-10000 Hz and 5 pps for 200 watt-second and 400-\n\n8000 Hz and 3.3 pps for 300 watt-second. The signal source is mounted on a \n\ncatamaran that can be towed at 2 to 8 knots with a 30.5m long cable. This signal \n\nsource is powered by a EG&amp;G Model 232-A power supply with an EG&amp;G Model \n\n231 triggered capacitor bank. \n\nTwenty four Aquadyne AQ-1 hydrophones with an Aquadyne AQ-200 \n\namplifier are arrayed in a streamer with 2 sections, and a total 15 m active length. \n\nThis streamer can be towed at speeds of up to 15 knots and records a frequency \n\nbandwidth of 0.5 Hz to 3 KHz. \n\nA Technical Survey Services, Ltd. (TSS) analog filtering unit was used to \n\nprocess the analog signal. This unit included a TVG amplifier, model 307B; a Tape \n\nReplay Unit, model 306 and a Stacking Unit, model 303.  \n\nDuring the earliest survey (VOUGA-86, described below) an EPC 4603 \n\nprinter was available to control the signal trigger and plot the analog signal. The \n\nlater Boomer survey (RIAV03) was carried out with an Analog-to-Digital signal \n\nConverter (ADC) installed on a workstation powered by an INTEL P4 processor \n\nunit. The software BoomDiRec (INGMARDEP 19/FCT/2003) was used in this \n\nworkstation to control the triggering mechanism and record the digital signal in a \n\nSEG-Y format file.

The nominal signal penetration depth of this \n\nBoomer unit is of up to 75 m with a resolution of 75 cm to 1 m, depending on the \n\ntype of sub-bottom materials and on the energy level used. \n\n \n\nThe Datasonics Chirp system \nThe Datasonics CAP-6000W Chirp sonar has a signal bandwidth of 1.5 to \n\n10 KHz, with 1 KW power. The chirp length can be of 5, 10, 20, 50 or 60 ms, with \n\npossible ping rates of 0.25 s, 0.5 s, 1.0 s, 2.0 s, 4.0 s, 8.0 s. The nominal \n\nresolution of the system is between 8 and 15 cm and the depth measurement \n\nprecision is approximately 0.1% of the depth, with a known sound velocity. The \n\nsub-bottom penetration may reach, in ideal conditions, 30 to 40 m, depending on \n\nthe sediment type. \n\nThe sonar fish has a towing speed of 1 to 10 knots, has four AT-472 \n\ntransducers and a hydrophone array of 8 elements with +12 dB of pre-\n\namplification. This fish can be operated down to 300m depth. \n\nProcessing of the uncorrelated chirp data is automated and done prior to \n\nrecording, inside the fish. The processing flow includes a match filter and the \n\ndetermination of the amplitude envelope (for a detailed discussion on chirp signal \n\nprocessing see Quinn et al., 1998; Henkart, 2006). \n\n \n\n \n\nThe GPS \nThe Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based radio navigation \n\nsystem managed and operated by the United States (U.S.) Government. It \n\ncomprises three segments, known as the Space Segment, the Control segment \n\nand the User Segment. The Space Segment and the Control Segment are \n\nmaintained and operated by the U.S. Government (detailed description can be \n\nfound in Stenbit, 2001). In general terms, the Space Segment consists of 24 \n\nsatellites that emit their spatial position and time information to the surface of the \n\nearth, and the Control Segment consists of a main control station and 5 monitoring \n\nstations that command and keep track of the satellites, as well as process and \n\ncorrect the information that these satellites emit. \n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n. \nFi\n\ngu\nre\n\n II\nI-2\n\n: S\nch\n\nem\nat\n\nic\n r\n\nep\nre\n\nse\nnt\n\nat\nio\n\nn \nof\n\n a\n B\n\noo\nm\n\ner\n s\n\nys\nte\n\nm\n d\n\nep\nlo\n\nye\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n a\n s\n\nm\nal\n\nl v\nes\n\nse\nl. \n\n 34 \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M.

It \n\npertains to the user receivers, GPS antennas and software that allow the \n\nreception, decoding and processing of GPS signals emitted by the satellites. It is \n\nthe User Segment that calculates the position, velocity and timestamp of the \n\nantenna. The GPS data acquisition methods for the user segment can divided into \n\nthree types according to the way the GPS signal carrier waves (called L1 and L2) \n\nare handled: \n\n \n\n1) The \u201cAbsolute Mode\u201d or \u201cSingle Point\u201d is the simplest method of operation \n\nthat involves a single frequency receiver of the GPS signal information \n\nmodulated by L1. The received data is processed to obtain the navigation \n\ninformation of the receiver Antenna. This method of operation has an \n\napproximate error in the range of 1 to 10 m in static mode, for continental \n\nPortugal; \n\n2) The \u201cDifferential GPS\u201d method (also known as DGPS) and the \u201cReal-Time \n\nKinematic GPS\u201d (RTK) method both imply the use of two receivers, one \n\nplaced on a location with known coordinates and another one mobile. The \n\nstatic station receives the L1 and L2 carrier waves and determines the \n\ndifferences between the known and received coordinate information. When \n\nthese differences are applied in real time (more precisely near real time) to \n\nthe pseudo distances to the mobile receiver, the method is called DGPS. \n\nWhen the differences are applied in real time to the wave phase, the \n\nmethod is called RTK. The DGPS has an accuracy of approximately 1 m \n\nand the RTK has an accuracy in the order of 1 to 2 cm. \n\n \n\nAn important aspect of the GPS is that, until the 1st of May, 2000, the United \n\nStates Government imposed intentional civilian GPS signal degradation called \n\n\u201cSelective Availability\u201d that reduced the accuracy of data acquired in \u201cSingle Point\u201d \n\nmode to values in the order of 30m. \n\nThe GPS navigation data for the seismic profiles presented in this work was \n\nacquired with either handheld single frequency receivers, working in \u201cSingle Point\u201d \n\nmode, or with dual frequency receivers from the Aveiro Harbor Authority (APA) \n\n 36 \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M.

Acquisition geometry parameters of the deployed \n\nsystems \nThe spatial configuration of the various components of the seismic \n\nreflection and navigation systems (i.e. signal source, receiver array, GPS antenna) \n\nconstitute part of the basic framework that must be adequately described in order \n\nto determine and parameterize both the navigation and the seismic data \n\nprocessing flows. The system geometry is fundamental in this work to estimate the \n\nseismic trace horizontal positions; to establish a common vertical datum for all the \n\nseismic traces; and to obtain a constant vertical sample interval, normal to the \n\nhorizontal datum (see Fig. III-4 and Fig. III-5 for a representation of the relevant \n\ngeometry parameters respectively of the boomer system and the chirp system). \n\n \n\nHorizontal geometry parameters \nThe horizontal geometry parameters, described hereafter, refer to the \n\nparameters used in this work to estimate the horizontal coordinates of the seismic \n\ntraces (see figures III-4 and III-5).  \n\n \n\nLayback \u2013 distance measured along the GPS antenna track-lines, between the \nGPS antenna position and the across-track line (i.e. line perpendicular to the track-\n\nline) that contains a certain reference point (e.g. the center of the receiver array, \n\nthe center of the signal source, etc). Under normal conditions the layback \n\ncorresponds to a distance towards the stern, for seismic equipments are normally \n\ntowed behind the vessel. For this reason, in this work, layback distances are \n\nalways measured as positive values. The types of layback are receiver layback, \n\n 37\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\nsource layback and mid-point layback, and are explained below (see figures III-4 \n\nand III-5). \n\n \n\nOffset (definition only used for the horizontal geometry parameters) \u2013 distance \nmeasured along the lines that are perpendicular to the GPS antenna track-line, \n\nand that contain a certain reference point (e.g. the center of the receiver array, the \n\ncenter of the signal source, etc). As a convention for this work, offset distances \n\nmeasured towards starboard are positive, whereas distances measured towards \n\nport are negative. The types of offset are receiver offset, source offset, source-\n\nreceiver offset and mid-point offset, and are explained below (see figures III-4 and \n\nIII-5). \n\n \n\nReceiver offset (RecO) \u2013 The offset between the GPS antenna track-line and the \ncenter of the receiver array. The RecO is relevant to the acquisition with a \nseparate source and receiver such as the boomer system (see figure III-4). \n\n \n\nReceiver layback (RecL) \u2013 The layback between the GPS antenna position and \nthe across-track line containing the center of the receiver array. The RecL is \nrelevant to the acquisition with a separate source and receiver such as the boomer \n\nsystem (see figure III-4). \n\n \n\nSource offset (SrcO) \u2013 The offset between the GPS antenna track-line and the \ncenter of the signal-source.

In this work, the navigation fixes were obtained with a \n\nsextant every 10 minutes and were marked on a navigation chart and on the \n\nprofile paper plots. The sextant navigation fixes have an estimated accuracy of \n\n150 meters (J. H. Monteiro, personal communication).

The remaining geometry \n\nparameters were considered irrelevant, because their variations were an order of \n\ndimension smaller than the 150 meter accuracy of the navigation method. \n\nThe Vouga 86 profiles used in this work were acquired with a firing rate of \n\ntwo shots per second and an energy source level of 100 Joules.

Monteiro, personal communication). \n\n \n\nThe RIAV99 Chirp survey \nThe RIAV99 survey (Pinheiro and Monteiro, 1999) occurred on the 27th and \n\n28th May of 1999, onboard the \u201cPangim\u201d launch of the Aveiro Harbor Authorities \n\n(Administra\u00e7\u00e3o do Porto de Aveiro \u2013 APA), equipped with the Chirp sonar; Drs. \n\nHip\u00f3lito Monteiro (IGM) and Luis Pinheiro (UA) were the co-chief scientists. \n\nTwelve profiles, 23.9 km long in total, were acquired during this survey \n\n(Figure III-6), three of which have no navigation data. The chirp impulse used was \n\n10 ms long and the seismic data was acquired at a rate of 2 shots per second. \n\nThe navigation tracks were obtained with a GPS from the University of \n\nAveiro and the position fixes were affected by signal quality deterioration due to \n\nthe Selective Availability (SA) still imposed by the government of the United States \n\nof America at the time of the RIAV99 survey. Values for the geometry parameters \n\n 44 \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M. (to be submitted) \u2013 seismic reflection in shallow environments \n \n \n\nwere not estimated because the GPS error of 30 m was significantly greater than \n\nthe combined effect of the geometry parameters (less than 5 m).  \n\n \n\nThe RIAV02 Chirp survey  \nThe RIAV02 survey (Pinheiro and Duarte, 2003a) was integrated in a \n\nscience promotion action called \u201cAc\u00e7\u00e3o Ci\u00eancia Viva da Geologia no Ver\u00e3o\u201d \n\n(which translates approximately as \u201cLive Science Activity of Summer Geology\u201d), \n\ncoordinated by the Geosciences Department of the Unviersity of Aveiro (DG-UA), \n\nin collaboration with the Marine Geology Department of the Instituto Geol\u00f3gico e \n\nMineiro (DGM-IGM) and by the Aveiro Harbor Authority (APA).  The scientific aims \n\nof this survey were twofold: \n\n \n\n1) To image the sediment architecture and bedrock structure of the Ria of \n\nAveiro sedimentary basin;  \n\n \n\n2) To do a detailed survey near the Northern Terminal (\u201cTerminal Norte\u201d) of \n\nthe Aveiro harbor, for the Underwater Archeology Group of Aveiro, to \n\nsearch for evidence of shipwrecks. \n\n \n\nThe campaign was carried out between the 17th and the 19th of September \n\nof 2002, on board the \u201cRia Azul\u201d launch of the Aveiro Harbor Authority, under the \n\nsupervision of Prof. Luis Menezes Pinheiro (DG-UA). Ninety kilometers of Chirp \n\nprofiles were acquired along the channels Espinheiro, S\u00e3o Jacinto, Vila, Mira, \n\nAveiro and Boco (see seismic coverage in figure III-6). The chirp impulse used \n\nwas 10ms long and the seismic data was acquired at a rate of 2 shots per second. \n\nNavigation data was acquired with a RTK GPS system of the Aveiro Harbor \n\nAuthorities, with the antenna placed aft, on the port side, less than half a meter \n\naway from the Chirp fish, using a single frequency GPS receiver from the \n\nUniversity of Aveiro (for redundancy), placed inside the pilot\u2019s cabin, 2-3 meters \n\naway from the Chirp fish. \n\nThe seismic profiles were digitally recorded in a Datasonics native format, \n\nlater converted to SEG-Y. The GPS geographic coordinates referred to the datum \n\n 45\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\nWGS84 were recorded in ASCII files, together with their respective UTC \n\n(Coordinated Universal Time) timestamps. \n\nFor more technical information on the RIAV02 survey please consult the \n\nsurvey report by Pinheiro and Duarte (2003a).  \n\n \n\nThe RIAV02A Chirp survey \nSimilar to the survey RIAV02, the survey RIAV02A (Pinheiro and Duarte, \n\n2003b) was coordinated by the DG-UA, in collaboration with the DGM-IGM and \n\nthe APA. The purpose of this survey was to improve the Chirp profile coverage of \n\nthe Ria of Aveiro that was started with surveys RIAV99 and RIAV02, and continue \n\nthe geophysical study of the sub-surface geology of the Ria of Aveiro. Also, a \n\ndetailed survey was carried out for APA on the Aveiro Channel, near the \u201cTerminal \n\nSul\u201d (the Southern terminal of the Aveiro Harbor, see Fig. III-6), to determine the \n\nunconsolidated sediment thickness in order to investigate the causes of recent, \n\nunexplained problems of harbor maintenance dredging operations. \n\nThe RIAV02A cruise was carried out onboard the \u201cRia Azul\u201d launch of the \n\nAPA, between the 21st and the 23rd of October, 2002. The Chirp profiles were \n\nacquired in the channels Espinheiro, S\u00e3o Jacinto, Mira, Aveiro, Ovar and Boco, \n\ntotaling 87 km in length (see schematic coverage in figure III-6). The chirp impulse \n\nused was 10 ms long and the seismic data was acquired at a rate of 4 shots per \n\nsecond. \n\nNavigation data was acquired in same conditions of the RIAV02 survey, \n\nwith a RTK GPS system of the Aveiro Harbor Authorities, with the antenna placed \n\naft, on the port side, less than half a meter away from the Chirp fish, and, with a \n\nsingle frequency GPS receiver of the University of Aveiro (for redundancy), placed \n\ninside the pilot\u2019s cabin, 2-3 meters away from the Chirp fish. \n\nThe seismic profiles were digitally recorded in a Datasonics native SEG \n\nformat, later converted to SEG-Y. The GPS geographic coordinates referred to the \n\ndatum WGS84 were recorded in ASCII files together with their respective with \n\nUTC (Coordinated Universal Time) timestamps. \n\nFor more technical information on the RIAV02A survey please consult the \n\nsurvey report by Pinheiro and Duarte (2003b). \n\n 46 \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M. (to be submitted) \u2013 seismic reflection in shallow environments \n \n \n\nThe RIAV03 Boomer survey \nThe RIAV03 boomer survey (Pinheiro et al., 2003) integrated the science \n\npromotion activity called \u201cAc\u00e7\u00e3o Ci\u00eancia Viva da Geologia no Ver\u00e3o\u201d, as did \n\nsurvey RIAV02, but this time integrated in a 2003 activity, and was coordinated by \n\nthe DG-UA, in collaboration with the DGM-IGM and APA,. \n\nThe scientific purpose of this campaign was to continue the exploratory \n\ngeophysical surveying of the sub-surface geology of the Ria of Aveiro, with \n\nimproved navigation and digital recording methods (when compared with previous \n\nboomer data of the Vouga 86 survey). \n\nThis survey lasted for 4 days, from the 2nd to the 5th of September, 2003, \n\nand was carried out onboard the \u201cRia Azul\u201d launch of the APA. A total of 47,1 km \n\nof boomer profiles were acquired along the channels Vila, S. Jacinto, Espinheiro, \n\nSama and Bulh\u00f5es (see seismic coverage in figure III-6). The source energy level \n\nused was 100 watt-second, with a ping rate of 2 shots per second. \n\nThe navigation fixes were obtained with the Aveiro Harbor Authorities RTK-\n\nGPS and with the DG-UA single frequency GPS receiver (again, for the sake of \n\nredundancy), both placed close to the pilot\u2019s cabin. The following geometry \n\nparameters of the acquisition systems and the DGPS were estimated onboard \n\nduring the operations: \n\n \n\n\u2022 Receiver offset (RecO) = 3 m  \n\n\u2022 Receiver layback (RecL) = 20 m \n\n\u2022 Source offset (SrcO) = 7 m \n\n\u2022 Source layback (SrcL) = 14 m \n\n\u2022 Mid-point offset (MptO) = +2 m      (see Equation III-1)  \n\n\u2022 Mid-point layback (MptL) = 17 m      (see Equation III-2)  \n\n\u2022 Source-receiver offset (SrcRec) = 10.5 m  (see Equation III-3) \n\n 47\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\n 48 \n\nThe seismic profiles were digitally recorded in SEGY format (little endian \n\nbyte order) and the geographic coordinates of the navigation fixes, referred to the \n\nDatum WGS84, were stored in ASCII files together with their respective \n\ntimestamps. \n\nFor more technical information on the RIAV03 survey please consult the \n\nsurvey report by Pinheiro et al. (2003). \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.4. Data processing flow \n\n \n\nThe data processing flow tested with the seismic data acquired in the Ria of \n\nAveiro can be divided into three stages, as depicted in figure III-7. The first stage \n\nconsisted of navigation data processing to obtain trace position estimates. The \n\nsecond stage consisted of processing procedures applied to the seismic files to \n\nobtain a common vertical datum and to improve the signal quality. Finally, the third \n\nstep consisted of quality control procedures to evaluate the consistency of the \n\nprocessed data. The errors diagnosed through the quality control procedures \n\nprovided better constrained parameters for the processing flow, in a feedback \n\nloop. The necessary processing steps were repeated until either the quality control \n\nresults were acceptable or no further improvements were obtained. The recorded \n\nChirp profiles did not preserve phase information and, for that reason, the \n\nprocessing flow for the Chirp profiles was limited to gain corrections and static \n\ncorrections. \n\nThe navigation processing procedures were applied using C++ or Visual \n\nBasic code specifically developed to accommodate the data file formats. The \n\nseismic signal processing procedures were applied using the seismic processing \n\nsoftware tools SPW (developed by Parallel Geosciences Corporation) and ProMax \n\nand PostStack Data Loader (developed by Landmark Graphics Corporation). \n\nThe processing flow diagram used in this work is illustrated in Fig. III-7. The \n\ndescription of each processing step is illustrated with real data examples in the \n\nnext chapter, together with the processing results. \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M.

Data processing results \n \n\nThis section presents the results of the processing flow as applied to the \n\nBoomer and Chirp datasets. First, each processing step is briefly described and \n\nillustrated with data examples. Then, the most common problems detected \n\nthrough the quality control procedures and the strategies to address them are \n\ndescribed. Finally, representative examples are presented of the seismic coverage \n\nafter navigation processing, and of the processed boomer and chirp profiles used \n\nfor seismic interpretation. \n\n \n\n3.3.1. Estimation of seismic trace positions \nThe aim of the navigation data processing was to integrate the GPS \n\nnavigation data with the seismic trace headers in order to estimate trace positions. \n\nThe processing flow applied to the navigation data involved the removal of corrupt \n\nnavigation data entries and outlier position fixes, as well as correcting the clock \n\nbias between the seismic system and the GPS. After these data corrections, the \n\nmidpoint layback was factored into the GPS timestamps and, finally, the trace \n\npositions were estimated based on the relationship between the navigation \n\ntimestamps and the trace timestamps. A more detailed description of the \n\nnavigation processing procedures is presented and illustrated below (process \n\nnumbering indicates the order of execution and follows the flowchart in Figure III-\n\n7). \n\n \n\nN1. Repeated GPS sentences filter \n\nGPS navigation data frequently includes sentences with either repeated \n\nposition fixes or repeated timestamps that were removed, always preserving the \n\nfirst sentence. \n\n \n\nN2. Outlier position fixes filter \n\nThe GPS navigation track frequently has outlier fixes that are identified as \n\nartifacts because their time and spatial distances relative to their neighbors are \n\n 50 \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M. (to be submitted) \u2013 seismic reflection in shallow environments \n \n \n\nexcessive, given the vessels speed. A specific code was developed in this work to \n\nfilter outlier position fixes; position fixes were filtered out if the distance to their \n\nneighbors exceeded a user input threshold value. The maximum valid distance \n\nparameter was chosen according to the relationship between the GPS sentence \n\noutput frequency and the ship average speed, e.g. for an output frequency of 1 Hz \n\nand a speed of 4 knots a ballpark value of 4 m was used for the outlier filter (at 4 \n\nknots a vessel covers approximately 2 m in 1 second). \n\n \n\nN3. Synchronism error correction \n\nAll detected systematic biases between the acquisition system clock and \n\nthe GPS clock were corrected on the timestamps of the navigation files. \n\n \n\nN4. Midpoint layback adjustment \n\nThe midpoint layback correction was applied to the position fixes through an \n\nadjustment to the positioning timestamps: the time for the vessel to cover the \n\nlayback distance was added to the position timestamp. This procedure assumes \n\nthat the midpoint follows closely the track line of the GPS antenna, which usually \n\nonly approaches reality when the vessel\u2019s travel direction is constant and the \n\ntowed equipment is not affected by cross currents. Figure III-8 shows a \n\ncomparison of a fault mapped pre- and post-layback adjustment. \n\n \n\nN5. Trace position interpolation \n\nThe trace numbers and respective timestamps were extracted from the \n\nSEG-Y headers. Repeated or corrupted timestamp values were removed and new \n\ntimestamps interpolated using valid neighboring timestamps. Trace X,Y \n\ncoordinates were interpolated based on the X,Y timestamp processed navigation \n\ndata (geographic coordinates were converted to Universal Transverse Mercator \n\nZone 29N coordinates in the World Geodetic System datum for 1984 \u2013 WGS84). \n\nFor each trace number, the Interpolation algorithm used the coordinates of the two \n\nclosest time neighbors found in the navigation data, and computed a linear \n\nposition interpolation weighted by the relative time difference of the trace to each \n\ncoordinate pair. The algorithm used is expressed in Equation III-4. \n\n 51\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\n \n\nTR(x,y) = N1(x,y) + (TRt \u2013 N2t) / (N2t-N1t) x (N2(x,y) \u2013 N1(x,y))  (Equation III-4) \n\n \n\n \n\nWere TRt and TR(x,y) are respectively the timestamp and the x,y \n\ncoordinates of the trace and N1t, N1(x,y) and N2t, N2(x,y) are, respectively, the \n\ntimestamp and coordinates of the two time neighbors of the trace. The figure III-9 \n\nshows the relationship between the processed navigation fixes and the trace \n\nposition estimates obtained with the algorithm developed in this work. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure III-8: Comparison of a fault mapped in boomer profiles acquired during the RIAV03 survey \n(Pinheiro et al., 2003) pre- and post-layback adjustment. \n\n 52 \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M.

Processed seismic signal \n \n\nThe aim of processing the seismic signal was twofold: (1) to improve the \n\ngeometrical consistency of the seismic data, and, (2) to enhance the seismic \n\nimaging of the sub-surface geology. The improvement of the geometrical \n\nconsistency of the seismic data was attempted with static corrections for tidal \n\naltitude variations. The boomer data also required normal move-out corrections to \n\nminimize the differences between normal move-out time and the recorded two way \n\ntime (TWT) affected by the system acquisition geometry. The main processing \n\nsteps to enhance the geological imaging of the boomer records included: (1) a \n\nbandpass frequency filter to reduce noise; (2) a predictive deconvolution filter to \n\n 53\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\nattenuate the water multiples; (3) an amplitude correction to compensate for the \n\nspherical divergence of sound propagation; (4) a spike deconvolution to compress \n\nthe wavelet energy; and (5) a Stolt F-K migration procedure to correct for the \u201cflat \n\nlayer\u201d assumption.   \n\nAs mentioned previously, the Chirp data was processed by automated \n\nhardware algorithms of the Chirp system that include match filtering, Hilbert \n\ntransform and instantaneous amplitude computation (for a review of the chirp \n\nprocessing flow see Quinn et al., 1998; Henkart, 2006). For this reason the \n\nrecorded Chirp data did not preserve phase information which prevented wavelet \n\nprocessing, such as data migration.  \n\nThe processing flow described below was fully applied to the boomer \n\nprofiles, whereas the Chirp profiles were only corrected for static shifts and, later \n\nprocessed with an automated gain control to improve the identification of reflection \n\ncontinuity patterns. Both Chirp datasets, with and without AGC were used for \n\ninterpretation, so that AGC-related artifacts could be easily detected. \n\nThe applied seismic processing steps, in order of execution, are as follows: \n\n \n\nS1. Early mute \n\nThe water column portion of the seismic records was muted in all \n\nprocessed boomer profiles. When required, an unprocessed profile was used to \n\ninterpret the water column portion of the profile. The early mute was applied to \n\nprevent the introduction of unnecessary noise to the signal frequency spectrum \n\nanalysis and to the spike deconvolution and migration processes. \n\n \n\nS2. Spherical divergence correction \n\nThe amplitude values were corrected with a linear time variant gain, \n\ncommon to all boomer profiles, to compensate for the energy loss due to the \n\nspherical divergence of the propagating signal.  \n\n \n\nS3. Normal move-out correction \n\nThe normal move-out corresponds to the sound travel time for a \n\nhypothetical geophone placed at the source point. The source-receiver offset of \n\n 54 \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M. (to be submitted) \u2013 seismic reflection in shallow environments \n \n \n\n 55\n\nthe Uniboom system can result in significant differences between the recorded \n\ntwo-way travel times and the normal move-out time. For very shallow water \n\nacquisition (less than 5 m), these time differences can be of a magnitude \n\nequivalent to tidal altitude variations (see effect of source-receiver offset in \n\nrecorded travel times in Fig III-10). \n\n \n\nS4. Static shifts \n\n \n\nThe static shifts were applied to the seismic profiles in order to refer their \n\ntime axis to a common vertical time datum, and thus minimize the vertical misties \n\nbetween profiles. The static shifts accounted for the correction of towing depths of \n\nthe Chirp fish and for the tidal altitude variations inside the lagoon. The equipment \n\ntowing depths were estimated onboard, during the data acquisition. The tidal \n\naltitude variations were estimated according to the tidal altitude tables and tidal \n\ndelays table for the Ria of Aveiro, provided by the Hidrographic Institute of the \n\nPortuguese Navy (Instituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico). For each profile, a single mean tidal \n\naltitude value was used to compute the static shift. A test was done at a later date \n\nto correct tidal altitude variations on a trace to trace basis, using software \n\nspecifically developed for the effect, but due to time constraints, the method was \n\nnot applied to the full data set. An example of the importance of the tidal correction \n\ncan be seen in figure III-11. \n\n \n\nS5. Burst noise removal \n\n \n\nThe burst noise removal algorithm aims to remove high amplitude noise \n\nbursts from the seismic traces. This algorithm compares the amplitude of a sample \n\nwith an amplitude average of samples from neighboring traces. It interpolates new \n\namplitude values for samples that are N times greater than neighboring average \n\n(where N is a processing parameter). The boomer profiles had abundant burst \n\nnoise and relatively low N values (N=2) had to be used to sensibly reduce the \n\nnoise bursts. This meant that local and sudden changes in amplitude of geological \n\nsignificance were filtered out and had to be interpreted on unprocessed profiles. \n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\n \n\nFi\ngu\n\nre\n II\n\nI-1\n0:\n\n C\nom\n\npa\nris\n\non\n o\n\nf b\noo\n\nm\ner\n\n p\nro\n\nfil\nes\n\n p\nre\n\n- \nan\n\nd \npo\n\nst\n-n\n\nor\nm\n\nal\n m\n\nov\ne-\n\nou\nt c\n\nor\nre\n\nct\nio\n\nn \nsh\n\now\nin\n\ng \nth\n\ne \nef\n\nfe\nct\n\n o\nf s\n\nou\nrc\n\ne-\nre\n\nce\niv\n\ner\n o\n\nffs\net\n\n in\n r\n\nec\nor\n\nde\nd \n\ntr\nav\n\nel\n ti\n\nm\nes\n\n.

Stolt F-K migration \n\n \n\nAccording to Sheriff and Goldart (1995) \u201c\u2026migration involves repositioning \n\ndata elements to make their locations appropriate to the locations of the \n\nassociated reflectors or diffracting points\u201d. In other words, unmigrated data \n\npresents an image which is only correct for flat-layers, since reflector dip is not \n\ntaken into account. As the imaged geological objects frequently are not flat, the \n\nseismic image is distorted and migration aims to correct that distortion. Stolt F-K \n\nmigration is a simple migration method in the frequency-wavenumber domain, that \n\nassumes a constant medium velocity (Stolt, 1978). Trace spacing for the boomer \n\nprofiles varied between ~0.5 m and 1 m due to frequent changes in traveling \n\nspeeds (a consequence of navigating the tidal channels of the Ria of Aveiro). This \n\nfact, together with the natural medium velocity variations, affected the migration \n\nresults, with evidence for both under migration (hyperbolae) and over migration \n\n(crossovers), which frequently coexist in the same profile.   \n\n \n\nA comparison of the various processing stages of the boomer data is \n\npresented in figure III-13. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3.3. Quality control results \n \n\nQuality control procedures aim to detect processing errors, caused either \n\nduring the execution of the non-automated procedures or due to inadequate \n\nchoices of the processing parameters. As discussed earlier, quality control results \n\nfeedback into the processing flow, which is partially or totally repeated until the \n\nnecessary non-random errors are corrected. Next, the results of the last iteration \n\nof the quality control procedures, prior to the geological interpretation of the \n\nseismic data, are presented and discussed. \n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\nFi\ngu\n\nre\n I\n\nII-\n13\n\n: \nC\n\nom\npa\n\nris\non\n\n b\net\n\nw\nee\n\nn \nva\n\nrio\nus\n\n p\nro\n\nce\nss\n\nin\ng \n\nst\nag\n\nes\n o\n\nf \non\n\ne \nbo\n\nom\ner\n\n p\nro\n\nfil\ne \n\n(s\nee\n\n t\nex\n\nt \nfo\n\nr \nde\n\nta\nile\n\nd \nde\n\nsc\nrip\n\ntio\nn \n\nof\n t\n\nhe\n p\n\nro\nce\n\nss\nin\n\ng \nst\n\nep\ns)\n\n: \nU\n\nnp\nro\n\nce\nss\n\ned\n \u2013\n\n r\naw\n\n tr\nac\n\ne \nam\n\npl\nitu\n\nde\n d\n\nis\npl\n\nay\n; P\n\nre\n-D\n\nec\non\n\nvo\nlu\n\ntio\nn \n\n\u2013 \nam\n\npl\nitu\n\nde\n d\n\nis\npl\n\nay\n a\n\nfte\nr \n\nap\npl\n\nyi\nng\n\n (\nS\n\n1)\n th\n\ne \nea\n\nrly\n m\n\nut\ne,\n\n (\nS\n\n2)\n th\n\ne \nsp\n\nhe\nric\n\nal\n d\n\niv\ner\n\nge\nnc\n\ne \nco\n\nrr\nec\n\ntio\nn,\n\n (\nS\n\n3)\n t\n\nhe\n n\n\nor\nm\n\nal\n m\n\nov\ne-\n\nou\nt \n\nco\nrr\n\nec\ntio\n\nn,\n (\n\nS\n4)\n\n t\nhe\n\n s\nta\n\ntic\n s\n\nhi\nfts\n\n, \n(S\n\n5)\n t\n\nhe\n b\n\nur\nst\n\n n\noi\n\nse\n r\n\nem\nov\n\nal\n a\n\nnd\n (\n\nS\n6)\n\n t\nhe\n\n b\nan\n\ndp\nas\n\ns \nfr\n\neq\nue\n\nnc\ny \n\nfil\nte\n\nr;\n S\n\npi\nke\n\n \nD\n\nec\non\n\nvo\nlu\n\ntio\nn \n\n- \n a\n\nm\npl\n\nitu\nde\n\n d\nis\n\npl\nay\n\n a\nfte\n\nr \nap\n\npl\nyi\n\nng\n (\n\nS\n7)\n\n t\nhe\n\n s\npi\n\nke\n d\n\nec\non\n\nvo\nlu\n\ntio\nn \n\nfo\nllo\n\nw\ned\n\n b\ny \n\na \nba\n\nnd\npa\n\nss\n f\n\nre\nqu\n\nen\ncy\n\n f\nilt\n\ner\n; \n\nS\nto\n\nlt \nF-\n\nK\n m\n\nig\nra\n\ntio\nn \n\n\u2013 \nam\n\npl\nitu\n\nde\n d\n\nis\npl\n\nay\n a\n\nfte\nr \n\nap\npl\n\nyi\nng\n\n (\nS\n\n8)\n th\n\ne \nS\n\nto\nlt \n\nF\n-K\n\n m\nig\n\nra\ntio\n\nn \nw\n\nith\n a\n\n c\non\n\nst\nan\n\nt s\nou\n\nnd\n v\n\nel\noc\n\nity\n m\n\nod\nel\n\n o\nf 1\n\n50\n0 \n\nm\n/s\n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. \n\n 60 \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M. (to be submitted) \u2013 seismic reflection in shallow environments \n \n \n\nTrackline analysis \n\n \n\nA visual analysis of the track lines was first carried out to identify gross \n\ntrace position estimate errors, such as position estimates over land and sharp \n\nnavigation turns not documented on the survey logbook. Most non-automated \n\nprocedural errors tend to be detected during this step of quality control. If trace \n\npositioning data repeatedly fails this quality check, then it should not be used for 3-\n\nD modeling (e.g. seismic unit mapping). The RIAV02 Chirp profiles acquired in the \n\nTerminal Norte for the underwater archeology survey had significant track line \n\nanomalies with multiple mismatches between documented ship turns and the \n\nplotted tracks. These errors, caused by triggering and recording problems of the \n\nchirp system, were not quantified, and could not be corrected, which meant that \n\nthese profiles were not used for 3-D interpretation. Apart from these Chirp profiles \n\nno significant track line anomalies were observed in the interpreted datasets. \n\n \n\n \n\nResidual misties \n\n \n\nThe first break reflection was picked in every seismic profile and the \n\nintersection misties were computed. These misties are referred here as residual, \n\nfor they are determined after the NMO, towing depth and tidal altitude corrections \n\nwere applied. Non-random residual misties may result from errors in estimates of \n\nthe mentioned static corrections and/or from errors in trace position estimates. The \n\nfinal residual misties have a mean value of 0.75 ms with a maximum of 2 ms and a \n\nminimum below the sampling interval (<0.1 ms). \n\n \n\n \n\nFirst break surface analysis \n\n \n\nThe analysis of systematic irregularities of the first break time surface \n\nallows the estimate of non documented variations of the geometric parameters \n\n(both horizontal and vertical).

A particular \n\ntype of position error related artifacts were frequently observed on the first break \n\nsurface of the processed dataset: V-shaped patterns that can be significantly \n\npronounced near profile intersections when the lines cross steep morphologies. In \n\nthe cases where residual misties are minimal, these artifacts can be explained \n\neither by GPS errors (e.g. non differential receiver data) or by the un-corrected \n\nmidpoint offset value: this last situation may be aggravated by lateral currents \n\naffecting the towed equipment. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.4. Discussion \n \n\nThe processing flows described aim at improving the interpretation \n\nconditions, to allow for a better identification, seismic characterization and \n\nmapping of the geological features of interest. Still, an assessment of several \n\ncharacteristics of the processed data set is required before the start of the \n\ninterpretation work. The focus of the present discussion on the processed data is \n\nthreefold: \n\n \n\n1. to inspect the signal quality and penetration on typical profiles and assess \n\nhow noise and artifacts interfere with the geological signal; \n\n \n\n2.  to determine the theoretical vertical and horizontal resolutions and \n\ncompare them with data examples in order to determine practical resolution \n\nvalues; \n\n \n\n3.  to assess what are the appropriate 3-D imaging scales according to the \n\nshape and size of the studied geological features and the relevant \n\nproperties of the multiple seismic datasets (i.e. resolution, positioning \n\nquality and profile separation). \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M.

Signal quality and penetration \n\nThe unprocessed boomer data shows frequent burst noise and a very long \n\ndirect arrival that frequently interferes with first break and deeper reflections. The \n\nlong direct arrival also provides evidence for a long ringing wavelet that \n\nsignificantly affects interpretation below strong reflections.  The occurrence of \n\ndeep reflections below transparent zones in processed profiles indicates that the \n\nspike deconvolution appears to effectively reduce some of these ringing effects \n\nand that most of the deeper coherent events are primary reflections (see Fig. III-\n\n15). The boomer signal had an observed penetration that varied between 50 and \n\n90 ms, i.e. approximately 68 m, assuming a constant sediment velocity of about \n\n1500 m/s. \n\nWhen present, sub-bottom coherent reflections in Chirp profiles usually \n\nhave high continuity and amplitude. Signal penetration rarely exceeds the 15 to 20 \n\nms. Some weaker coherent reflections were recognized through comparison of \n\ndata sets with and without automatic gain control (AGC) amplitude treatment (see \n\nFig. III-16). This lack of variety of the seismic facies and poor penetration \n\ndetermines that distinguishing seismic units can be done mostly either locally or \n\nthrough correlation with the interpretation of boomer profiles from the same area, \n\nwhere available. \n\nNavigation conditions, tidal and wind currents in particular also seriously \n\naffected data quality. The characteristic mid to late afternoon northerly winds that \n\ncross the Ria of Aveiro tended to generate turbulence on the upper water layer \n\nwhich degraded the signal quality. When navigating against strong tidal currents, \n\nin particular closer to the lagoon inlet, the towed equipment suffered significant \n\ndrag, which caused turbulence and added noise to the data. The changes in the \n\nsurface current speeds caused by both wind and tides affected the navigation \n\nspeed (varying between 2,5 and 7 knots). These speed variations resulted in the \n\nvariable trace separation already described and, occasionally, in sudden changes \n\nin the pitch of the Chirp fish that are recognizable on the profiles by series of blank \n\ntraces. Profiles Riav03-P02B and RIAV03-P02C illustrate some of these issues \n\n(see Fig. III-17). \n\n 64 \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M.

This particular characteristic of the data set and its impact on \n\nthe resolution and geological interpretation is analyzed and discussed in a later \n\nchapter of this work. \n\n3.4.2. Resolution of seismic data \n \n\nIn seismic data, resolution commonly refers to \u201c\u2026the minimum separation \n\nbetween two features such that we can tell that there are two features rather than \n\none\u201d  (Sheriff, 1985; Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). The horizontal and vertical \n\nresolutions, and related interpretation scales of the Boomer and Chirp profiles will \n\nnow be discussed here and illustrated using some features surveyed with both \n\nsystems.  \n\n \n\nHorizontal resolution \n\nIn theory, the horizontal resolution of un-migrated seismic data corresponds \n\nroughly to the diameter of the \u201cfootprint\u201d of the seismic wave on a reflector. This \n\nfootprint can be described as the area of constructive signal reflection off a \n\nreflective surface. This area is called the First Fresnel Zone and is a function of the \n\nsignal frequency and of the distance of the reflector to the signal source (see \n\nEquation III-5). Note that when reflector dimensions are smaller than the Fresnel \n\nzone, their response is that of a diffraction point (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). \n\nRadius of the first Fresnel Zone = \nf\ntV\n\n2\n  (Equation III-5) \n\nwhere V is the average sound velocity, t the depth in time and f the signal \n\nfrequency. \n\n 66 \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M.

For these \n\nfrequencies and an average sound velocity of 1500 m/s, the horizontal resolution \n\nof the boomer profiles ranges from 4 m at shallow depths, up to 25 m at greater \n\ndepth. Considering that the trace separation of the boomer profiles ranges from \n\n0.5 to 1 m, the Fresnel zone of each boomer shot overlaps those of 2 to 4 \n\nneighbor shots at shallow depths and 25 to 50 shots at depth.  \n\nMigration of seismic data aims to collapse the Fresnel zone energy (thus \n\n\u201crepositioning\u201d energy to its point of origin). The horizontal resolution of migrated \n\ndata is harder to assess and is affected by issues such as errors in migration \n\nvelocities and noise rearrangements. Still, assuming the sampling theorem that at \n\nleast two samples must be obtained per feature wavelength, then the horizontal \n\nresolution of the migrated data should be greater than two migration bin widths. \n\nFor the migrated boomer profiles the bin size corresponds to the trace separation, \n\nwhich means that the horizontal resolution of the migrated boomer data probably \n\nvaries between 1.5 to 3 m (for three bin widths).   \n\nThe resolution values presented above for the migrated boomer profiles are \n\noptimistic for two reasons: (1) side echoes remain un-migrated and, where these \n\noccur, horizontal resolution is reduced; (2) trace separation varies along the same \n\nprofile due to ship velocity variations and, as the Stolt F-K migration algorithm \n\nused requires constant trace separation and a constant sound velocity, the \n\nmigrated profiles have under-migrated and over-migrated reflections which also \n\ncontribute to reduce horizontal resolution.  \n\n \n\nHorizontal resolution of the Chirp profiles \n\nThe chirp data has a dominant frequency circa 2.5 KHz and a \n\ncorresponding Fresnel zone of approximately 2.5 m at 5m depth and of 10 m at 30 \n\nm depth (assuming a sound velocity of 1500 m/s). Trace separation of the chirp \n\ndata also varies between 0.5 and 1 m, as with the boomer profiles, which means \n\nthat each trace Fresnel zone roughly overlaps three Fresnel zones of neighboring \n\nshots, at the shallowest depths. According to the documentation provided by the \n\n 70 \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M. (to be submitted) \u2013 seismic reflection in shallow environments \n \n \n\nchirp manufacturer (Datasonics Corp.), the automated processing flow of the chirp \n\ndata also has a \u201ccollapsing\u201d effect of the Fresnel zone and the characteristic \n\nhorizontal resolution of the processed chirp data is 1 to 2 m. \n\n \n\nVertical resolution \n\nThe vertical resolvable limit between two reflections was proposed by Lord \n\nRayleigh as a half-cycle in order to minimize interference effects. In practice, the \n\nballpark value used to estimate vertical resolution of most seismic reflection \n\nsystems is \u00bc of the dominant wavelength. In the case of the boomer data, the \n\nvertical resolution is estimated according to depth, to account for the perceptible \n\nchanges in the dominant frequencies and seismic velocities with depth. At shallow \n\ndepths, for a frequency of 1 KHz and a seismic velocity of 1500 m/s, the boomer \n\nvertical resolution is roughly 35 cm, whereas at greater depths, for a frequency of \n\n350 Hz and a seismic velocity of 2000 m/s, the boomer vertical resolution is \n\napproximately 1.5 m. \n\nThe vertical resolution for the Chirp data corresponds approximately to the \n\ninverse of the source bandwidth (Gutowski et al., 2002). For the 8.5 KHz \n\nbandwidth of the Chirp data and an average sound velocity of 1500 m/s, the \n\nestimated vertical resolution is of approximately 17 cm. \n\nA visual comparison of a Boomer and chirp profiles crossing the same \n\nfeatures is shown in figure III-19, which illustrates the differences in the resolution \n\nof both systems discussed above, providing a practical assessment of the \n\ntheoretical estimates.  \n\n \n\nSeismic resolution and interpretation scale \n\n \n\nThe horizontal resolution for migrated boomer data is 1.5 to 3 m (varying \n\nwith trace separation), and the vertical resolution is between 35 cm near the \n\nsurface and 1.5 m at depth. Thus, the maximum interpretation scales for migrated \n\nboomer data are between 1:3000 and 1:6000, in the horizontal plane, and 1:700 \n\nnear the surface to 1:3000 at depth, in the vertical plane. Chirp data has \n\ntheoretical horizontal resolutions of 1 to 2 m, and vertical resolution of 17 cm, \n\n 71\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\nwhich correspond to maximum horizontal interpretation scales between 1:2000 \n\nand 1:4000, and maximum vertical scale of 1:340. \n\n \n\n3.4.3. Coverage constraints on seismic imaging \n\nThe positioning errors, profile separation and signal penetration are, together, the \n\nproperties of a 2-D seismic coverage that will constrain the imaging of geological \n\nfeatures. This section discusses the impact of positioning errors and misties on 3-\n\nD imaging of a geological feature with 2-D seismic data from two different \n\nperspectives: 1) the production of accurate images, versus 2) the production of \n\nconsistent images. A simple method to determine maximum 3-D imaging scales is \n\nproposed. This is followed by the discussion on how profile separation and signal \n\npenetration determines if a geological feature can beadequately imaged in 3-D.  \n\n \n\nPositioning errors and misties \n\nThe problem of dealing with the impact of positioning errors and misties on \n\n3-D imaging of a geological feature with 2-D seismic data can be stated according \n\nto two different approaches: \n\n1) Accurate 3-D imaging: the 3-D image has to be an accurately \n\npositioned representation of the seismic observations; \n\n2) Consistent 3-D imaging: the 3-D image has to be a consistent \n\nrepresentation of the seismic observations; i.e. the horizon \n\nmisties at profile intersections are below the scale of the \n\nrepresentation of the image. \n\nFrom the accurate 3-D imaging point of view, positioning errors and the seismic \n\nresolution values will determine the maximum 3-D imaging scales. Given the \n\nvariability in the positioning errors of multiple surveys, the data with the poorest \n\npositioning will control maximum scale of an accurate 3-D image. A slightly \n\ndifferent problem is presented when the main objective is to obtain a consistent 3-\n\nD image. In these cases, it is the residual interpretation misties, determined on a \n\nfeature by feature basis, taken together with seismic resolution values that \n\ndetermine the maximum 3-D imaging scales. \n\n 72 \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M.

The \nminimum separation of the reflections observed in the chirp profile is of 2 samples (0.242 ms, \ncorresponding to 18 cm for a sound velocity of 1500 m/s). The minimum separation of the \nreflections observed in the boomer profile is of 5 samples (0.5 ms, corresponding to 38 cm for a \nsound velocity of 1500 m/s). \n\n 73\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\nIt should be noted that the misties are a result of both horizontal and vertical \n\npositioning errors (as described in a previous sub-chapter), as well as a result of \n\ninterpretation problems. Also, the misties of an interpreted feature are differently \n\naffected by the positioning errors depending on the relationship between the real \n\npositioning errors and the shape of the feature (e.g. the misties of a flat horizontal \n\nfeature will only be the result of the vertical positioning errors and of the \n\ninterpretation errors). \n\nA 3-D image that is both accurate and consistent will respect the seismic \n\nresolution, the positioning error and the horizon misties. It is possible to obtain a \n\nballpark value for the scale of such 3-D image by adding the seismic resolution, \n\nthe known positioning errors and the misties. Still, the resulting image may not be \n\nfully accurate for some positioning errors may remain unaccounted due to the \n\ncomplex relationship between positioning errors and misties. \n\nThe Table III-1 presents examples of the 3-D imaging scale estimates for \n\nthe seismic data of the Ria of Aveiro, determined following the guidelines \n\npresented above. \n\n \n\n \nTable III-1 - Horizontal (hor.) and vertical (ver.) estimates of 3-D imaging scales for the boomer \nand chirp data. ver.shallow and ver.deep refer to shallow and deep vertical scale computations; \nseis.res. \u2013 seismic resolution; gps \u2013 gps positioning error; clock sync \u2013 error of synchronism \nbetween the seismic acquisition system and the positioning system; offsets \u2013 errors resulting from \nthe gps antenna layback and offset to the seismic trace; towing depth \u2013 error in estimating the \nmean depth of the towed equipment; tidal height \u2013 error in the tidal height altitude estimate; mistie \n\u2013 seismic profile intersection mistie of interpreted horizons; Consistent 3-D image resolution = \nseismic resolution + misties; Accurate 3-D image resolution = seismic resolution + know \npositioning errors + misties; res.m \u2013 Image resolution in meters; scale = 1:(res.m x 2000).  \n \n\nSystem gps\nclock \nsync\n\noffsets\ntowing \ndepth\n\ntidal \nheight\n\nres.

(to be submitted) \u2013 seismic reflection in shallow environments \n \n \n\nProfile separation and seismic penetration \n\nAn estimate of the expected wavelength and directionality of the geological \n\nfeatures to be imaged should be done a priori to assess if the available or planned \n\nseismic coverage (i.e. profile separation and signal penetration) can adequately \n\nimage those features. The preliminary estimate of the shape and size of the \n\ngeological objects can be based on multiple seismic profiles (if available) that \n\nimage the same feature. According to Hengl (2006), the signal frequency that \n\ndescribes an object can be determined by the density of inflection points. \n\nTherefore a simple assessment can be done by determining by minimum distance \n\n(?x, ?y, ?z) between inflection points observed along the feature\u2019s major axis, as \n\nwell as the strike and dip of these axes. These can be determined by resorting to \n\nstereographic projection methods. Large scale, reasonably flat surfaces like a \n\nmarine transgression erosion surface may be described as having long \n\nwavelengths (i.e. ?x, ?y of several kilometers and a comparatively small ?z) dipping \n\ntowards the offshore. Such a surface can be adequately modeled with widely \n\nspaced profiles perpendicular to the surface dip sense. In contrast to these simpler \n\nfeatures, channel features like the modern small irregular tidal channels of the Ria \n\nof Aveiro are characterized by comparatively smaller wavelengths. A simple model \n\nof these tidal channels can be described by ?x (1/2 length) &lt;250 m; ?y (1/2 width) \n\n&lt;50 m; ?z (1/2 depth) &lt;5 m), with various dominant trends and very gentle dips. \n\nSuch features would require more densely packed, orthogonal and equally spaced \n\nprofile coverage (less than 250 m apart). \n\nAccording to the sampling theorem, for a wave to be properly represented it \n\nhas to be sampled at least twice per cycle (Nyquist sampling frequency). From a \n\n3-D imaging point of view, this means that the maximum profile separation directly \n\ndetermines the minimum width between inflection points for a feature to be \n\nproperly imaged. In other words, if we consider that a geological feature can be \n\ncharacterized by certain wavelength, e.g. the extent of a symmetrical sedimentary \n\nbasin, then this basin has to be crossed at least by two parallel profiles separated \n\nby a maximum of half the basins diameter. A greater separation between profiles \n\nwill result in spatial aliasing of the features to be imaged. Nevertheless, the way \n\n 75\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\nprofile separation limits the choice of model scale is also dependent on the \n\npreferred orientation of the modeled object.  \n\nThe penetration of the seismic signal adds another dimension to this \n\nproblem. A geological feature may have a shape and size that could, theoretically, \n\nbe adequately imaged by a profile grid, and yet, modeling this feature may not be \n\npossible if the changes in dip (a function of the ratios of ?x/?z and ?y/?z) put the \n\nfeature \u201cbeyond reach\u201d of the seismic system penetration. A simple method to \n\nassess if a certain seismic coverage allows the correct imaging of a feature is to \n\ncompare the ratio of profile separation (?prof) to system penetration (?pen) with \n\nthe ratios of ?x/?z and ?y/?z that describe the shape and size of the feature. If \n\n?prof /?pen is greater than ?x/?z or ?y/?z, then the object cannot be reliably imaged \n\nwith the available seismic coverage. This means that either more closely spaced \n\nprofiles or a system with better penetration are required to properly image this \n\nfeature.  \n\nThe adequate 3-D imaging and consequent geometrical characterization of \n\na geological feature with 2-D seismic reflection profiles is further complicated by \n\nthe frequently fractal nature of the geological features (for an introductory overview \n\nof fractals in nature see Mandelbrot, 1983). Although fractal objects are self-similar \n\nor scale-invariant, i.e., are made of parts that resemble the whole object, Euclidian \n\nmeasures of fractal objects are not scale independent as they are for Euclidian \n\nshapes (Barton et al., 1992). In other words, Euclidian measures of fractal objects \n\nare only comparable when made at the same scale. This means that problems \n\narise when attempting to characterize the geometry of a geological object with a \n\nvariable 2-D seismic coverage. Measures such as length or strike determined on \n\nprofiles with various resolutions, signal penetration and profile separations can \n\nvary significantly for the same geological object, simply because the scale of \n\nobservation changes from place to place, and not because of a significant \n\ndifference in the objects geometry. Figure III-20 illustrates this problem applied to \n\nthe mapping of a morphological feature and of a fault surface with variably spaced \n\nprofiles. \n \n\n \n\n 76 \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M.

In areas of closely spaced \nprofiles, the fault model will show greater aparent complexity when compared to areas of more \nwidely spaced profiles. \n \n \n\nFinally, when trying to determine the orientation of linear features, the \n\nrelationship between sample proximity and positioning errors has to be inspected \n\nin order to determine if the interpreted orientation is sufficiently accurate to suit \n\n 77\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\nresearch needs. For certain threshold relationships between profile separation and \n\ntrace positioning errors, interpreted rectilinear features will present significant \n\nangular deviations that tend to produce \u201ckink\u201d like patterns. This is a common \n\nartifact observed near profile intersections, related to positioning errors. Therefore, \n\nthere is a minimum effective profile separation for reliable interpretation of this type \n\nof features, which depends on trace positioning errors. The relationship between \n\nprofile separation, positioning errors and error of the modeled direction is \n\npresented in figure III-21. This figure can be used as a guide to assess whether \n\nirregularities in an imaged linear feature are positioning error related artifacts or a \n\nreliable representation of the interpreted feature. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure III-21: Relationship between profile separation, positioning errors and angular error of the \nmodeled direction of a linear feature.

Axes are labeled in arbitrary but consistent \ndistance units. \n\n 78 \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M. (to be submitted) \u2013 seismic reflection in shallow environments \n \n \n\nIn the case of the Ria of Aveiro, the separation between the profiles varies \n\nsignificantly, mainly because the navigation was strongly constrained by the \n\nlagoon\u2019s hydrography. Profile separation ranges from near coincidental (tens of \n\ncentimeters apart along several tens of meters), up to hundreds of meters apart, in \n\na same tidal channel, and kilometers apart when considering profiles acquired in \n\ndifferent channels. A generalized value for the profile separation in different \n\nareas/channels of the lagoon is difficult to determine because local track line \n\nvariations are very common and often significant. Consequently, the choice of the \n\nappropriate interpretation scale as a function of the seismic coverage will have to \n\nbe done on a case by case situation.  The final decision will be one of whether to \n\nuse a single interpretation scale or to make multiple interpretations at different \n\nscales for different locations. \n\n \n\n3.5. Summary and conclusions \n \n\nThe seismic data set used for this study has multiple vintages and the \n\nprofile coverage was significantly constrained by the lagoon\u2019s hydrography. This \n\nwork shows that appropriate documentation of the acquisition procedures and \n\nadequate processing of the navigation data are necessary for a reliable estimate \n\nof the trace positions. Corrections such as static corrections to compensate for \n\ntides and normal move-out corrections allow for a better constrained common \n\nvertical datum and time scale of the seismic profiles. These data positioning \n\nimprovements result in a better spatial consistency for different data vintages.  \n\nThe study of the relatively small geological objects on a coastal system like \n\nthe Ria of Aveiro requires closely spaced profiles. For profile separations smaller \n\nthan 100 meters, errors in the seismic trace position estimates are significantly \n\ninfluenced by the systems acquisition geometry and tidal altitude variations. Errors \n\nin the order of several meters due to the use of single mode GPS, lack of control \n\nof mid-point layback/offset values, tidal altitudes of up to 2.5 meters all add up. \n\nThese errors can be comparable or even greater than 2-D seismic resolution of \n\nboomer and chirp systems. This will significantly degrade the quality of the seismic \n\n 79\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\ninterpretation and 3-D imaging, with effects being more relevant the smaller the \n\nobject of study. \n\nIdeally, trace and sample positioning errors should be less than half the \n\nseismic resolution, so that no sample is placed within the sampling area of a \n\nneighbor sample (for a discussion on this issue see Hengl, 2006). This could be \n\nachieved with full horizontal and vertical RTK GPS positioning of both source and \n\nreceiver; synchronization of the GPS and the seismic acquisition system should be \n\nwithin 10 ms, so that, when surveying at 5 knots, errors are at most equal to the \n\nRTK-GPS. RTK GPS altitude data is essential to properly correct the tidal and or \n\nthe eventual swell effects on the towed equipments.  \n\nThe seismic signal processing proposed in this work, particularly of boomer \n\ndata, provides significant improvements in signal quality and interpretability. Of \n\nparticular importance when surveying shallow environments is the normal moveout \n\ncorrection, which allows shallower samples to be adjusted to a common vertical \n\ndatum and improve significantly the ability to correlate interpretations between \n\ndifferent seismic data vintages.  \n\nThe heterogeneity of the seismic coverage, signal quality, penetration and \n\nresolution all constrain the use of the data to mostly local but detailed \n\ninterpretations of the geological objects of the Ria of Aveiro. Particular care must \n\nbe taken in assessing the impact of the variable horizontal coverage implied by the \n\nvariable profile separation, and the probable fractal nature of the imaged \n\ngeological features. The greatest profile separation used in a 3-D image should \n\nconstrain the maximum imaging scale because imaging a fractal object at different \n\nscales may lead to unreliable results (see Fig III-20). To a certain extent, a parallel \n\ncan be drawn between the approach that has to be adopted in this type of studies \n\nand onshore geological mapping. As with onshore geological mapping, the coastal \n\ngeological map will have to be constructed from local meso-scale observations, \n\nwhere densely packed seismic data has to be locally interpreted in a similar way to \n\nthe interpretation onshore of available rock outcrops. Correlation between these \n\nwindows of observation (clusters of profiles or outcrops), if possible, has to be \n\ninferred from other indirect evidence (nature of soil, morphology etc).

Producing a map at such a \n\ndetailed scale was only possible after a strict control and correction of the \n\nnumerous processing issues discussed in the work. \n\nThe relative scarcity of published works that deal with the problems of \n\nacquisition and processing of very resolution seismic reflection data in shallow \n\nwaters probably reflects the fact that the typical study sites and objectives of other \n\nshallow water studies allowed for the use of more straightforward surveying \n\nstrategies. Typical study targets extend for several kilometers and regular survey \n\ngrids appropriate for such targets are reasonably followed. Positioning \n\nrequirements it these cases can be met by the available navigation methods such \n\nas GPS, and the uncertainties in the geometry of the deployed system are \n\nirrelevant given the typical scale of the studies. Navigation constraints inside a \n\nlagoon like the Ria of Aveiro require different exploration strategies, which involve \n\nlocally detailed studies of relatively small targets (less than 100 meters wide). This \n\nrequires greater integration and control of navigation and of the deployed seismic \n\nsystem in order to describe the study targets with sufficient detail. The priorities in \n\nfuture work should include improving the operational conditions and positioning \n\ncontrol, in order to acquire data over the shallower areas of the lagoon (water \n\ndepth less than 2 meters) and better constrain such factors as tidal altitude and \n\nsynchronization between the seismic system and the navigation system. \n\nDevelopments in these areas can contribute to the development of a functional \n\nvery high resolution 3-D seismic reflection system capable of operating in these \n\nenvironments and with sub-meter resolutions and signal penetration of up to 100 \n\nmeters.

This paper presents results from four high resolution seismic surveys \n\ncarried out in the \"Ria de Aveiro\" barrier-lagoon (Portugal) in 1999, 2002 and \n\n2003. These include three Chirp surveys (RIAV99, RIAV02, RIAV02A) and one \n\nBoomer survey (RIAV03). Evidence of extensive gas accumulation and seepage in \n\ntidal channel sediments from the \u201cRia de Aveiro\u201d barrier-lagoon is presented here \n\nfor the first time. This evidence includes: acoustic turbidity, enhanced reflections, \n\nacoustic blanking, domes and acoustic plumes in the water layer (flares). The \n\nstratigraphy and the structural framework control the distribution and extent of the \n\ngas accumulations and seepage in the study area. However, in these shallow \n\nsystems, tidal altitude variations have a significant impact on gas detection with \n\nacoustic methods, by changing the raw amplitude of the enhanced seismic \n\nreflections, acoustic turbidity and acoustic blanking in gas-prone areas. Direct \n\n 83\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\nevidence of gas escape from drill-holes in the surrounding area has shown that the \n\ngas present in the \u201cRia de Aveiro\u201d consists of biogenic methane. Most of the gas in \n\nthe study area was probably mainly generated in Holocene lagoon sediments. \n\nEvidence of faults affecting the Mesozoic limestones and clays underlying some of \n\nthe shallow gas evidence, and the presence of high amplitude reflections in these \n\ndeeper units, raise the possibility that some of this gas could have been generated \n\nin deepersedimentary layers, and then migrated upwards through the fractured \n\nMesozoic strata. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.1. Introduction \n \n\nEstuaries and coastal lagoons are depocenters of organic rich sediments \n\nwhich are sources of methane (Kelley et al., 1995; Van der Nat and Middelburg, \n\n2000). These systems are excellent and easily accessible natural laboratories to \n\ninvestigate the mechanisms of methane generation, accumulation, migration and \n\nescape (e.g. Garcia-Gil, 2003). However, the spatial and temporal variability and \n\nthe complexity of these shallow gas systems require dense grids of geophysical \n\ndata in order to get representative sampling. As a result, the importance of the \n\nescape of methane gas from sediments of estuarine and lagoon environments to \n\nthe atmosphere is still poorly known or underestimated, and has not been taken \n\ninto account in the International Panel for Climate Change assessment reports of \n\nthe geological emissions of methane (Hovland et al., 1993; I.P.C.C., 2001; Etiope, \n\n2004; Judd, 2004). Estuaries and coastal lagoons where responsible for the \n\ngeneration of large accumulations of oil and gas now being exploited. \n\nAccumulations of shallow gas in such present-day systems were the volume and \n\nconcentration are adequate, may also be exploited for biogas, for local use in the \n\nnear future, similarly to what is already happening in African lakes and in artificial \n\ndairy lagoons (e.g.Williams and Frederick, 2001; Hirsch et al., 2005). Thus, \n\nunderstanding the importance, the controlling factors and the mechanisms of \n\nmethane generation, accumulation and escape in coastal shallow water systems \n\nmay yield useful indicators for oil and gas exploration and contribute to the \n\n 84 \n\n\n\nDuarte et al. (2007) - Acoustic evidence of gas \n \n \n\nevaluation of the potential of present day biogenic methane gas in estuaries and \n\ncoastal lagoons as a possible alternative energy source. \n\nSeismic evidence of gas accumulation and seepage in sediments has been \n\nreported in all marine and coastal environments, both in deep and shallow water \n\n(e.g. Hovland and Judd, 1988). Seismic reflection methods have proven to be \n\nparticularly useful for the identification, characterization and mapping of the \n\ndistribution of gas accumulations and seepage. Nevertheless, comprehensive \n\nseismic investigations of barrier-lagoon environments are still sparse (e.g. the \n\nVenice lagoon in McClennen et al., 1997). \n\nThe aim of this paper is to present, for the first time, high-resolution seismic \n\nevidence of gas accumulation and seepage in the sediments of a tidal channel in \n\nthe \u201cRia de Aveiro\u201d barrier-lagoon, and to characterize the stratigraphic and \n\nstructural control of these occurrences. Data from 4 different cruises carried out in \n\n1999, 2002 and 2003, all with a very dense seismic coverage, was used. The \n\npurpose was three-fold: (1) to have enough detail and resolution to adequately \n\nmap small gas accumulations (of the order of 30 m long); (2) to verify the \n\nconsistency of these gas accumulations in a period of several years; (3) to analyze \n\nprofiles acquired in the same area at different tidal altitudes, in order to investigate \n\nthe likely influence of tidal effects on the detection of gas accumulations and \n\nescape. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.  Setting: The \u201cRia de Aveiro\u201d \n \n\nThe Ria de Aveiro is a very recent barrier-lagoon system, located in the \n\nNorthwest Portuguese coast (Fig. IV-1). It is a remarkable example of a fast \n\ncoastal evolution, from an open bay to the sea, formed ca. the Xth century, to the \n\npresent barrier-lagoon system (Abecasis, 1954). The Ria de Aveiro is composed \n\nof a complex network of tidal channels, tidal flats, salt marshes and supra-tidal \n\nsand isles and it encompasses an area of approximately 530 km2, making it the \n\nlargest coastal lagoon system in Portugal. It is located at the mouth of a drainage \n\nbasin of 3,635 km2, covered mostly by the Vouga River and its tributaries.  Water \n\n 85\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\n 86 \n\ndepths are usually quite shallow, of 1 to 2 meters, reaching locally more than 20m \n\non the navigable channels. Water breaks and harbor installations are common \n\nalong several of the navigable channels of the lagoon, and the communication with \n\nthe sea, originally through a natural migrating inlet, is now made via an artificial \n\ninlet created in 1808. Tides are predominantly semi-diurnal, with an average \n\namplitude at the inlet of 1.90m, ranging between 1.22m and 2.57m, during neap \n\nand spring tides respectively (Teixeira, 1994). The tidal amplitude decreases with \n\nthe distance from the inlet, but it is present in the entire lagoon. The phase lag, \n\nvariable in high and low water, increases upstream up to 5 hours, with low and \n\nhigh tides sometimes occurring simultaneously in different parts of the lagoon \n\n(Dias et al., 2000). Water volume at low spring tides is 65hm3 and the tidal prism at \n\nspring tides is about 80 hm3, with an estimated time of residence of the water of \n\nthree days (Teixeira, 1994). \n\n \n\nOnshore geology reveals dune, beach and lagoonal sediments of \n\nQuaternary age, composed essentially of unconsolidated sands and clays, \n\noverlying a sedimentary succession of Mesozoic clays and limestones of the \n\nLusitanian Basin gently dipping to the west. Borehole data ranging from a few \n\nmeters to over 200 meters and seismic reflection profiles (Chirp and Boomer) \n\nshow that the Quaternary sediments are less than 10 meters thick to the East of \n\nthe study area, and over 100 meters thick to the West (the deeper sediments are \n\nprobably Neogene), with an erosive lower boundary, locally channelized, mostly \n\nflat and gently dipping less than 1\u00ba to the west (Marques da Silva, 1992; Teixeira \n\nand Pinheiro, 1998). Direct observations of escape of biogenic methane from \n\nseveral drill holes in Quaternary sediments from the area surrounding the Ria of \n\nAveiro were reported for the first time by the Portuguese Geological Survey in \n\n1967 (Faria et al., 1967). Since then, similar evidence has been observed on other \n\nland wells for water exploration. More recently, Duarte et al. (2003) identified \n\nseveral high backscatter patches on the sidescan sonar imagery acquired in other \n\nparts of the Ria de Aveiro by the Portuguese Hydrographic Institute in 1998, which \n\nthey interpreted as related to gas escape; some of these features may correspond \n\nto pockmarks. \n\n\n\nDuarte et al.

The Espinheiro channel is the main outflow conduit of the Vouga \n\nRiver. It feeds the Vila channel that communicates with the lagoon inlet. The \n\nEspinheiro channel has an inner meandering channel and a prograding sand body \n\nwhere it meets the Vila channel. The Vila channel is regularly dredged to maintain \n\nship navigation conditions. \n\n \n\n4.3. Database and Methods \nFour high resolution seismic reflection surveys, RIAV99, RIAV02, RIAV02A \n\nand RIAV03, were carried out in the \"Ria de Aveiro\", on board the \u201cRia Azul\u201d, from \n\nthe Aveiro Harbor Authority, to investigate the seismic stratigraphy, the structural \n\ncontrol and the existence of gas accumulations. Over 220 km of Chirp profiles \n\nwere digitally acquired with a Datasonics CAP-6000W Chirp sonar during the \n\nRIAV99, RIAV02 and RIAV02A cruises. The signal bandwidth was 1,5-10KHz, the \n\noutput power was 1KW and the chirp length 10ms (approximate vertical resolution \n\nof 10-15cm). During the RIAV03 cruise, 47km of additional Boomer profiles \n\n(EG&amp;G Uniboom) were also acquired. The output energy used was 100-watt s-1 \n\nand the receiver array consisted of a single-channel streamer with 24 \n\nhydrophones. The signal frequency spectrum ranged from 250 to 1400Hz \n\n(estimated vertical resolution&lt;2m). Seismic processing was carried out with the \n\nSPW software package (Seismic Processing Workshop, from Parallel Geoscience \n\nCorporation).  \n\nThe processing of the boomer records included frequency band-pass \n\nfiltering and time-variant amplitude gain correction. Deconvolution was also \n\napplied on some of the boomer records. The estimated depths of the seismic \n\nreflections were calculated using velocities of 1,500 m/s for the seawater and \n\n1,700 m/s as an average for the soft sediments. From these 4 surveys, 11.5 km \n\nand 59 km of Boomer and Chirp profiles, respectively, were selected to obtain a \n\n 88 \n\n\n\nDuarte et al. (2007) - Acoustic evidence of gas \n \n \n\n 89\n\ndense grid of seismic profiles that covers the navigable part of the channels in the \n\nstudy area, with a separation between profiles that ranges from 10 to 75m (Fig. IV-\n\n2). The ship speed was about 4-5 knots. Dynamic positioning of the profiles was \n\ndone with differential GPS in the 2002 and 2003 cruises, and with conventional \n\nsingle-frequency GPS (affected by Selective Availability) in the RIAV-99 cruise \n\n(the 6 km of profiles in the study area from this cruise were mainly used for \n\ninterpretation, but not for mapping, given the large associated positioning errors).  \n\nA constant time shift was applied to each profile to account for tidal \n\nfluctuations and the depth of the towed equipment (fish and streamer). Residual \n\nmisties, in general, did not exceed 1 ms. The vertical datum of the surveys was \n\ncorrected to match the Hydrographic Zero Datum used by the Portuguese \n\nHydrographic Survey, by matching the estimated horizon depths with the true \n\ndepths for the same horizons derived from geotechnical soundings that cut \n\nthrough the Mesozoic bedrock (based on unpublished reports from the Harbor \n\nAuthority kindly made available for this study). SEG-Y seismic data management \n\nand interpretation was carried out using the Kingdom Suite (Seismic Micro-\n\ntechnology Inc.) and the Openworks and Seisworks-2D (Landmark Graphics \n\nCorporation) seismic interpretation software packages. All the available borehole, \n\nseismic and geographical data was inserted into a GIS database (ArcGis, ESRI; \n\nsee Fig. IV-2 for location of seismic lines and borehole data), which was used \n\nthroughout this work for spatial computations.  \n\n \n\n4.4.

(2007) - Acoustic evidence of gas \n \n \n\nIn these shallow systems, the survey coverage variability, the frequent changes in \n\nprofile direction, the strong and variable bottom multiple interference caused by \n\nshallow water depth and the tidal altitude changes (about 2 meters), and the \n\nscarcity of reflections, due to sediment homogeneity or the lack of signal \n\npenetration in the presence of sandy sediments, all limit the identification of gas \n\nevidence. Taking into account all these limitations, all diagnostic seismic features \n\nthat could potentially be related to gas in the Ria de Aveiro were identified on each \n\nseismic line, compared with the neighboring lines to check for the lateral \n\nconsistency, and mapped. \n\nThe seismic evidence of the presence of gas identified on the seismic data \n\nfalls into two main groups: \n\n1. Sub-bottom/bottom seismic features: acoustic turbidity in the sediment \n\nlayers, enhanced reflections, acoustic blanking, domes; \n\n2. Water-column seismic features: acoustic plumes (flares), bottom \n\nacoustic turbidity and cloudy acoustic turbidity in the upper water layer \n\n(cloudy turbidity; Garcia-Gil et al., 2002). \n\n \n\nSub-bottom/bottom seismic features \n \nAcoustic Turbidity \n\nAcoustic turbidity (AT) is recognized as a variable degree of disturbance on \n\nthe seismic record (AT in Fig. IV-3), which sometimes allows coherent reflections \n\nto be followed through, with reduced amplitude (Hovland and Judd, 1988; Garcia-\n\nGil et al., 2002). Acoustic turbidity can be caused by gas bubbles or vesicles in \n\ntypically impermeable sediments, although it can also be caused by other point \n\nscatterers like e.g. coarser grains in poorly sorted sediments. Small percentages \n\nof gas volume (1%) are enough to generate acoustic turbidity (Fannin, 1980). \n\n \nEnhanced reflections \n\nEnhanced reflections (ER) are characterized by a marked lateral increase in \n\nthe amplitude of coherent reflections (ER in Fig. IV- 3). They can be caused by the \n\naccumulation of gas bubbles below an impermeable interface, generally at the top \n\nof a sediment bed or at an angular truncation, or by the presence of methane-\n\nderived authigenic carbonates. Lateral facies variations non-related to gas can \n\n 91\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\n 92 \n\nalso cause enhanced reflections. The frequency content of gas-related enhanced \n\nreflections will in general be lower than the original reflections and phase reversal \n\ngenerally occurs (Hovland and Judd, 1988).  \n\n \n\nAcoustic blanking \nAcoustic blanking (AB) is characterized by a transparent or signal-starved \n\ndomain in the seismic section, topped either by an enhanced reflection, broken or \n\ncoherent, or by acoustic turbidity (AB in Figs. IV-3, IV-4 and IV-5). The signal \n\nstarvation is interpreted as the result of the attenuation of the acoustic signal \n\ncaused by gas in the sediments. Depending on the amount of gas, reflections that \n\ncross or lie below the area with gas often exhibit a pull-down effect caused by the \n\nlower sound propagation velocity in the gassy sediments. In areas such as the Ria \n\nde Aveiro, where old shipwrecks are abundant, it should also be noted that \n\nwooden debris can also cause localized acoustic blanking because the acoustic \n\nresponse of dry wood in wet sediments is similar to that of gas (Quinn et al., \n\n1997).  \n\n \n\nDomes  \nThe domes (DM) observed in the study area (DM in Figs. IV-3 and IV-5) are \n\nsmall elongated elevations, 2 meters high and 30 to 50 meters long, found at the \n\nbottom of the lagoon, usually capped by a strong reflection at the water-sediment \n\ninterface, and are associated with acoustic evidence of gas accumulations (Fig. \n\nIV-3). Although the nature of these features is not yet fully understood due to the \n\nlack of sampling, they may result from mud extrusion caused by gas overpressure \n\nof clayey sediments, from accumulation of organic debris, or they may correspond \n\nto small (methane related?) carbonate  build-ups.  \n\n \n\n Seismic features in the water column \n \n\nAcoustic plumes (flares), acoustic turbidity near the channel bottom, and \n\ncloudy turbidity in the upper water layer (upper 10 ms) are extensively observed \n\non the Chirp records from the study area (Figs. IV-3 and IV-6). These features \n\nmay result from a variety of factors, including gas bubbles in the water column, \n\n\n\nDuarte et al. (2007) - Acoustic evidence of gas \n \n \n\nsuspended matter, gas in fish swimming bladders, acquisition system artifacts, or \n\nship noise.  \n\n \n\nAcoustic plumes \n\nThe Chirp records reveal several localized areas with well defined plumes \n\n(PL in Fig. IV-3) of acoustic turbidity in the water layer (flares), usually elongated, \n\neither vertical or strongly dipping, often starting near the water-bottom and \n\nextending towards the surface (Fig. IV-6). The amplitude of the acoustic reflections \n\nin these plumes is often stronger in their upper part. These features are similar to \n\nthose described in other locations (e.g. the Ria de Vigo, Spain, Garcia-Gil et al., \n\n2002) as resulting from sound reflecting off gas bubbles that are escaping from the \n\nsediments to the water column. Occasionally, some of these plume-like features \n\ndo not start at the water-bottom. Although in some cases they may correspond to \n\nfish shoals, several of them are interpreted here as gas bubbles escaping \n\nobliquely to the seismic profile, particularly when they are found over sediments \n\nwith other evidence of gas accumulation.  \n\n \n\nBottom acoustic turbidity \n\nBottom acoustic turbidity is also locally observed on Chirp sections in the \n\nRia de Aveiro, close to the lagoon bottom, usually above enhanced reflections or \n\nacoustic blanking (Fig. IV-3). These features can be caused by gas escape, where \n\nthe gas is being quickly dissolved as it rises through the water column, or by a \n\nhigh density of benthic/pelagic organisms, possibly benefiting from a gas-enriched \n\nfeeding environment.    \n\n \n\nCloudy acoustic turbidity in the upper water layer \n\nCloudy turbidity, similar to that  described by Garcia-Gil (2002) in the Ria de \n\nVigo, is also frequently observed in the upper water layer, on the Chirp seismic \n\nsections (upper 5-10 ms; Fig. IV-7). It can be caused by point scatterers in the \n\nwater column, like gas bubbles, matter in suspension or gas in the swimming \n\nbladders of fish. The fact that this shallow turbidity in the study area generally \n\noccurs at a typical water depth, suggests the existence of some sort of control on \n\n 93\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\nthe occurrence of these point scatterers or the existence of a water depth \n\ndetection threshold for these features, possibly due to signal energy loss in the \n\nwater column. The observed frequency of point reflections is also clearly related \n\nwith the tidal altitude. Point reflections counted on a total of ca. 20000 traces, are \n\n10 times more frequent at lower tidal altitudes (37 point reflections per 1000 traces \n\nduring low tide, ebb and flood) than at high tidal altitudes (4 point reflections per \n\n1000 traces during high tide).  \n\n \n \nFigure IV-3: Acoustic evidence of gas accumulation and seepage from the NW gas field (GF1) \nobserved on Chirp profiles. Note the association of the observed dome structure (40x20 m and 2 m \nhigh) with evidence of gas accumulation in the sediments observed on these 5 Chirp profiles in the \nEspinheiro Channel. Also notice the marked difference in the strength and extent of the gas \nevidence on the profiles 2 and 3, acquired at low tide (stronger and more extensive), with the \nevidence on the profile 5, acquired at high tide (weaker).

Distribution and extent of gas accumulation and \nseepage \n \n\nAcoustic evidence of gas accumulation in the sediments is abundant in the \n\nstudy area (ca. 14% of the total area) and it is concentrated in two main gas fields \n\nin the northeast and in the southwest sectors (GF-1 and GF-2; Fig. IV-8), where \n\n 97\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\n 98 \n\nthe water is shallower, usually less than 4 meters. Both gas fields exhibit several \n\nof the characteristic acoustic evidence of gas accumulations. \n\nOn the Chirp sections, acoustic evidence of gas accumulations is generally \n\nobserved in the first few meters of the sediments and rarely reaches the water-\n\nbottom interface. Where a dense seismic coverage is available and the \n\ninterpretation well constrained, the gas accumulations generally consist of roughly \n\ncircular or elongated patches, 30 to 150 m long. This shows why it is necessary in \n\nthese systems to acquire a dense seismic coverage, with separations between \n\nlines of less than 15m, in order to adequately map these accumulations without \n\nspatial aliasing. As such, in this study, interpolation and extrapolation of gas \n\nanomalies for mapping was only carried out when the separation between \n\nadjacent profiles was less than 20 meters, and therefore the mapped evidence of \n\ngas accumulation may underestimate the total area of gas accumulation.  \n\nAreas with acoustic blanking are frequent and are often associated with \n\nadjacent enhanced reflections. These reflections are interpreted as resulting from \n\ngas migration from the zones of acoustic blanking, to the neighboring sedimentary \n\nlayers. Acoustic blanking is also frequently adjacent to and in apparent continuity \n\nwith acoustic turbidity on neighboring profiles. Often, this adjacent acoustic \n\nturbidity is very similar to the top of the acoustic blanking zones but it is not \n\nmapped as such, given the difficulty in sometimes unambiguously determining the \n\noccurrence of blanking below the turbidity (either due to multiple interference, \n\nabsence of reflections due to an homogeneous sedimentary section or poor signal \n\npenetration in sandy sediments). It has also been observed that gas-prone areas \n\nwith strong evidence of acoustic blanking on profiles acquired at low tide, often \n\nappear as areas of acoustic turbidity (sometimes very tenuous and of reduced \n\nextent) on almost coincident profiles acquired at high tide (see Fig. IV-3 and \n\ncompare the overall strength and extent of gas evidence on profiles 2 and 3, \n\nacquired at low tide, with the gas evidence on profile 5, acquired at high tide).  \n\nIn the study area, the acoustic evidence of gas accumulation is generally \n\nobserved in the upper seismic unit that corresponds to Holocene tidal channel-fill \n\nsediments (probably ca. 800-200 years BP, Duarte et al., 2005).

This relationship is particularly obvious in the northwestern dome on \n\nGF1 (Fig. IV-3), where the dome clearly mimics the shape of an acoustic blanking \n\nzone located down-dip, a few meters to the west (Fig. IV-3). On the Chirp profile \n\nthat crosses the southern edge of this dome, there is no evidence of acoustic \n\nblanking; instead, a 20 meter-wide graben is observed, with a small offset affecting \n\nthe sediment layers and the water-bottom, suggesting that the degassing of the \n\ndeeper sediments might be causing the subsidence and deformation of the upper \n\nsedimentary layers (Fig. IV-3).  \n\nUnlike the other gas evidence, the eight acoustic plumes observed in the \n\nstudy area occur in deeper waters (more than 6 meters), where currents are \n\nstronger, the bottom sediments are coarser and where, sometimes, the Mesozoic \n\nclays and limestones outcrop. No clear evidence of a nearby source of gas \n\naccumulation was found for the acoustic plumes. Nevertheless, six of the eight \n\nobserved plumes occur above a 1.5 km-wide graben with an offset of \n\napproximately 40 meters, that affects the Mesozoic bedrock (Fig. IV-9). A spatial \n\nrelationship of gas evidence with the Mesozoic bedrock fracture pattern is also \n\nobserved in other places, such as near the GF1 where a possible dome rests \n\nabove the faulted Mesozoic bedrock (Fig. IV-5).  \n\n \n \n\n4.5.

AB: Acoustic Blanking; S1 \u2013 erosive top of \nthe Cretaceous bedrock; m \u2013water-bottom multiple. \n \n\n 101\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\nThis focusing of gas escape and space and time heterogeneities suggests \n\nthat the premise of good water mixture might not hold true in this specific type of \n\ncoastal lagoon systems and that the kind estimation presented by Middelburg \n\n(2002) may significantly underestimate gas emissions from small coastal lagoons.  \n\nThe variability in space (distribution and extent) and time (with the tidal \n\ncycle) of the acoustic evidence of gas in the studied area is in accordance with \n\nand illustrates in detail the fact that methane concentrations in rivers, estuaries \n\nand other coastal environments are highly variable at various spatial and temporal \n\nscales (Sansone et al., 1999). Unlike other very high resolution seismic-reflection \n\ngas studies of coastal environments, such as Chesapeake Bay (Hagen and Vogt, \n\n1999) or the Ria de Vigo (Garcia-Gil et al., 2002), that recognized and mapped \n\nlarge gas accumulations with a typical seismic profile separation of 200-250 \n\nmeters, the seismic investigation of gas accumulation and seepage in the \n\nsediments of the \"Ria de Aveiro\" required specific surveying and mapping \n\nstrategies. This is because of the high spatial and temporal variability of barrier \n\nlagoon environments like the \"Ria de Aveiro\". Aspects like the strong and variable \n\nbottom multiple interference caused by shallow water depth and tidal altitude \n\nchanges (about 2 meters), and the scarcity of high-amplitude laterally continuous \n\nreflections, due to sediment homogeneity or the lack of signal penetration in the \n\npresence of sandy sediments, all limit the ability to detect gas evidence, in \n\nparticular the characteristic blanking effect or lateral changes of amplitude of the \n\nreflections. Also, the typical acoustic evidence for gas in the Ria de Aveiro consists \n\nof patches, 30 to 150 meters long, probably due to the characteristic size of the \n\ntidal channel infill sediment bodies that host the majority of the gas accumulations. \n\nThus, the sizes of the gas-related objects to be studied required a profile \n\nseparation of the order of 10 meters, or less, to adequately to map the gas \n\nevidence.  \n\nComparison of approximately coincident seismic sections acquired at \n\ndifferent tidal altitudes, revealed that the acoustic detection of gas in the sediments \n\nand in the water layer of the Ria de Aveiro is particularly influenced by tides, with \n\namplitudes and size of the evidences being stronger and larger in profiles acquired \n\nduring low tide than on profiles acquired during high tide. The same influence is \n\n 102 \n\n\n\nDuarte et al. (2007) - Acoustic evidence of gas \n \n \n\nalso apparent on the observation of the cloudy turbidity in the water layer of the \n\nChirp seismic lines, which could be gas-related, and that probably corresponds to \n\nthe cloudy turbidity also observed in the Ria de Vigo (Garcia-Gil et al., 2002). \n\nAgain, the frequency of these turbidity events varies with the tidal cycle, being \n\nroughly 10 times more frequent at low tide than at high tide. The simplest \n\nexplanation for the observed tidal altitude control on the frequency of the \n\noccurrence of cloudy turbidity is a possible tide-related control on the behavior of \n\nsome specific fish assemblages, more easily detectable by the acoustic systems \n\nused in this study. Nevertheless, it should be noted that ichthyofauna studies in \n\nthe Ria de Aveiro (e.g. Garnerot et al., 2004; Pombo et al., 2005), showed that a \n\ndecrease in marine influence results in a decrease in total density and biomass of \n\nfish assemblages; this is in disagreement with the pattern observed here: if the \n\npoint reflections result from fish, then a higher density of reflections in the water \n\ncolumn would be expected during high tide, which is just the opposite of what is \n\nobserved. An alternative explanation is that there is a tidal control on the \n\nabundance of gas bubbles of optimal resonance-size for the acoustic frequencies \n\nused in this investigation (250 Hz to 1.4 KHz of the Boomer system and 1.5 to 10 \n\nKHz of the Chirp system) caused by changes in pressure and or salinity resulting \n\nin ebullition and/or bubble size variation. This is consistent with a preferential \n\ndetection of gas bubbles at low tide, when lower hydrostatic pressure and salinity \n\ncould trigger ebullition and/or bubble size variations. An increase in bubble size \n\ntowards the surface could explain why most point reflections are observed in the \n\nupper part of the water column (need for the bubbles to reach an optimal \n\nresonance size for detection with the frequencies used). \n\nThe described relationships between tidal altitude and the gas evidence in \n\nthe Ria de Aveiro can probably be explained by tidal fall triggered methane \n\nebullition (e.g. Jackson et al., 1998) and/or by tidal induced changes in the number \n\nof optimal resonance size bubbles for the used frequencies (Best et al., 2004). \n\nTherefore, one needs to be careful when using acoustic methods to map gas \n\naccumulations, because areas with a similar amount of methane content in the \n\nsediments may produce a different acoustic response, such as seen in the Ria de \n\nAveiro, depending on the stage of the tidal cycle during which they where \n\n 103\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\n 104 \n\nsurveyed. Further data acquisition and modeling of the methane solubility and the \n\nvariations in bubble size with the tidal cycle in the Ria de Aveiro is required to \n\nunderstand the relative importance of methane ebullition and the relationship of \n\nbubble resonance with the frequency range of the seismic reflection system in the \n\ndetection acoustic evidence of gas.  \n\nThe fact that, where the acoustic plumes are observed, the sediments are \n\ngenerally relatively coarse and permeable (fine to coarse sands, Duarte et al., \n\n2003), could indicate a more diffuse fluid escape through these sediments. On the \n\nother hand, the lack of associated evidence of gas accumulation in the Holocene \n\nsediments, and the observed spatial relationships between the acoustic plumes \n\nand the fracture pattern of the Mesozoic bedrock, support the hypothesis of \n\nfocused gas escape through the fractures in the Mesozoic bedrock. It should be \n\nnoted, however, that a clear association between the acoustic plumes and some \n\nsort of gas source in the Mesozoic bedrock was not unambiguously found in the \n\nstudy area, nor gas analyses are yet available, and therefore the gas source of \n\nthese acoustic plumes still remains unknown. \n\nThe results obtained with this high resolution seismic study have shown that \n\nthe Ria of Aveiro is an interesting natural laboratory to study the generation, \n\nmigration and escape of shallow gas on a typical barrier lagoon system. The \n\ndense grid of seismic data allowed the detailed mapping of the different types of \n\nseismic evidence of gas accumulation and seepage. Moreover, seismic data \n\nacquired in different years showed that these gas accumulations are found \n\nconsistently in the same area for long time periods, although minor changes in the \n\ncharacter of the reflections can be observed. The interpreted evidence of gas \n\naccumulation and seepage ranges from acoustic blanking and turbidity, enhanced \n\nreflections in the sediments, to the presence of flares in the water column and, \n\nalso possibly, the occurrence of small domes at the bottom of the lagoon, closely \n\nassociated with gas accumulations at depth. Boomer records, in particular, \n\nsuggest that the faults observed in the Mesozoic bedrock may also constitute \n\npathways for the escape of deeper gas of yet unknown source and composition.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M.

Evidence of gas \n\nincludes: acoustic turbidity, enhanced reflections, acoustic blanking, pockmarks \n\nand buried trough pockmarks, disrupted horizons and acoustic plumes in the water \n\ncolumn (flares). The impact of the tidal altitude variations on the detection of gas \n\nwith seismic methods is analysed and a quantitative analysis of the changes of the \n\namplitude strength of reflections with tidal altitudes is presented. Reflection \n\namplitudes in gas-prone areas are clearly stronger during low tide with maxima \n\nduring ebb, decreasing with flood with minima during high tide; this pattern \n\nconfirms that ebullition and gas escape is triggered mainly by the decrease of \n\npressure (hydraulic load) that occurs during the falling tide.

Introduction \n \n\nThe study of gas occurrence and seepage, mainly methane, is of significant \n\ninterest for its role as a greenhouse gas and potential contribution to climate \n\nchanges (Hovland et al., 1993; Houghton et al., 2001; Etiope, 2004; Judd, 2004), \n\nas an important energy source and as a cause of natural hazards (Best et al., \n\n2006). According to Best (2006), understanding these roles of methane gas \n\nrequires the development of models of methane gas generation and gas flux, as \n\nwell as the acquisition of reliable model input data, such as sediment accumulation \n\nrates, organic matter concentrations, amount of gas present, sediment shear \n\nstrength, etc. Considering that the organic rich muddy sediments of estuaries and \n\ncoastal lagoons are prime sources of methane gas (Kelley et al., 1995; Van der \n\nNat and Middelburg, 2000), modern day estuaries and coastal lagoons are \n\npreferential objects for these studies on methane gas generation and gas flux \n\n(Garcia-Gil, 2003; Duarte et al., 2007).  \n\nThe present work presents new data from a Chirp high-resolution pseudo-\n\n3D seismic survey, carried out to investigate shallow gas occurrences in a main \n\ntidal channel of the Ria of Aveiro barrier lagoon, located in North-West Portugal \n\n(Pinheiro and Duarte, 2003b). This study aims at understanding the geological \n\ncontrols of the distribution and extent of acoustic evidence of gas accumulations \n\nand seepage, continuing previous work carried out in other areas of the Ria \n\n(Duarte et al., 2007). The dense pseudo-3D seismic coverage was chosen to \n\ncharacterize the 3D geometry of the Holocene lagoon sediments architecture and \n\nof the structure of the Mesozoic bedrock, allowing the identification of the \n\nstructural controls on the fluid migration pathways and gas accumulation zones. \n\nThe abundance of seismic data, both in time and space allowed a \n\nquantitative investigation of the hypothesis that the tidal cycle affects the extent \n\nand distribution of seismic evidence of gas, which was proposed in previous work \n\nin the Espinheiro Channel sector (see chapter IV; Duarte et al., 2007). The \n\namplitudes of the bottom reflection of the Chirp data were investigated at the same \n\nlocations at different tides in order to determine if there was a significant change in \n\n 106 \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M.

Setting: the Ria de Aveiro \n \n\nThe Ria de Aveiro is a recent barrier-lagoon system, located along the \n\nnorthwest Portuguese coast, composed of a complex network of tidal channels, \n\ntidal flats, salt marshes and supra-tidal sand isles. It encompasses an area of \n\napprox. 530 km2, making it the largest coastal lagoon system in Portugal (Fig. V-\n\n1). It is located at the mouth of a drainage basin of 3,635km2, fed mostly by the \n\nVouga River and its tributaries. Water depths are usually quite shallow, 1-2m, \n\nlocally reaching more than 20m in the navigable channels, with maxima greater \n\nthan 29m at the artificial inlet that establishes communication with the sea. \n\nThe semi-diurnal tidal cycle is the strongest forcing mechanism in the \n\ndynamics of the Ria of Aveiro. The small water volume at low spring tides is \n\n65x102 m3, and barely covers the main tidal channels. The tidal prism at spring \n\ntides is about 80x102 m3, and more than doubles the water mass in the lagoon, \n\ncovering the extensive tidal flats and salt marshes the constitute the majority of the \n\nlagoon area. The estimated time of residence of the water in the lagoon is of 3 \n\ndays (Teixeira, 1994). Tidal amplitudes at the inlet average 1.90 m, ranging \n\nbetween 1.22 and 2.57 during neap and spring tides, respectively (Teixeira, 1994). \n\nThe tidal amplitude decreases with distance from the inlet but it is measurable in \n\nthe entire lagoon. The phase lag, variable at high and low water, increases \n\nupstream up to 5h, with low and high tides sometimes occurring simultaneously in \n\ndifferent parts of the lagoon (Dias et al., 2000).  \n\nThe coastal and lagoon sediments are essentially unconsolidated dune, \n\nbeach, barrier and lagoonal sands and clays, deposited during the Pleisto-\n\nHolocene transgression and highstand. Elevated sand and gravel beach deposits \n\nfrom prior Quaternary cycles are described towards inland (Teixeira and \n\nZbyszewski, 1976). The Quaternary sedimentary sequence lays unconformably \n\nover the Mesozoic sedimentary succession of clays and limestones of the \n\nLusitanian basin, deposited during the opening of the Atlantic. Borehole log data \n\nreaching down to 200m in depth and seismic reflection profiles (Chirp and \n\nBoomer) show that the Quaternary sediments are less than 10m thick to the \n\neastern end of the lagoon, and over 100m thick closer to the inlet; the deeper \n\n 108 \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M. (to be submitted) \u2013 Structural and tidal controls on gas \n \n \n\nsediments in this area are of unknown age, possibly Neogene (Marques da Silva, \n\n1992; Teixeira and Pinheiro, 1998). \n\nThe consolidated lagoon bedrock of Mesozoic age is cut by a marine \n\nravinement surface that dips gently westwards (less than 1\u00ba) and by an older \n\nfluvial erosion surface probably dating from the last glacial maximum, 18Ky BP \n\n(Duarte et al., 2007). The Mesozoic units dip approximately 3-6\u00ba to the west. The \n\nmajor structural feature cutting the Cretaceous rocks is a 2km wide, 40-60m deep, \n\nNNW-SSE trending graben of unknown age mapped in the Espinheiro sector \n\n(Teixeira and Pinheiro, 1998; Duarte et al., 2007) and that probably extends \n\nthrough much of the lagoons\u2019 bedrock (see Figs V-2 and V-3).  \n\n \nFigure V-2: The main sub-cropping fault trends in the Ria of Aveiro as inferred from available seismic data \nadapted from Teixeira and Pinheiro (1998).

The answers from \n\nlocal parishes to the Marqu\u00eas de Pombal enquiries on the 1755 earthquake report \n\nthat the Vouga river waters \u201cboiled as if they were on fire\u201d and that the waters from \n\nthe Mira lagoon (at the south end of the Ria) \u201cappeared to boil so hard that they \n\nwould break at the lagoon shore as if they were sea waves\u201d (Coelho, 2005; \n\nOliveira, 2005); these tales may be explained by gas releases from seismically \n\ndestabilized sediments. \n\nThe first unequivocal direct observations of escape of biogenic methane \n\nfrom several drill holes in Quaternary sediments from the area surrounding the Ria \n\nof Aveiro were reported by the Portuguese Geological Survey in 1967 (Faria et al., \n\n1967). Since then, similar evidence has been observed in other land wells for \n\nwater exploration. During previous work, Duarte et al. (2003) identified several \n\nhigh-backscatter patches on sidescan sonar images acquired in other parts of the \n\nRia de Aveiro by the Portuguese Hydrographic Institute in 1998, which they \n\ninterpreted as related to gas escape; some of these features may correspond to \n\npockmarks. More recent investigations with chirp and boomer high resolution \n\nseismics in the Espinheiro tidal channel of the Ria de Aveiro (Pinheiro and Duarte, \n\n2003a; Pinheiro and Duarte, 2003b; Pinheiro et al., 2003; Duarte et al., 2007) have \n\nshown extensive acoustic evidence of gas accumulation and seepage, including \n\nacoustic turbidity, enhanced reflections, acoustic blanking, domes and acoustic \n\nplumes in the water column (flares). Recently, in September of 2006, gas samples \n\nwere collected from extensive bubble trains observed during falling tide in a \n\ndocking pier (\u201cDoca Pesca\u201d) in the Ria of Aveiro. The analysis of the gas samples \n\ncomposition by chromatography revealed that the gas was mostly methane (L.M. \n\nPinheiro, personal communication) \n\nThe study area investigated in this work (Fig. V-1) consists of two tidal \n\nchannel domains in the Ria de Aveiro, including the Cidade channel and the \n\nTerminal Sul harbor docks area, each surveyed over an area of roughly 0.5km2. \n\nThese tidal channels are part of the main navigation channel of the Aveiro harbor \n\nand are frequently dredged for ship navigation purposes down to a minimum water \n\ndepth of approximately 6,5 m below the hydrographic zero.  \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M.

Database and methods \n \n\nA major pseudo 3D chirp high resolution seismic survey, RIAV02A, was \n\ncarried out in 2002 in the Terminal Sul harbor area of the Ria de Aveiro (Pinheiro \n\nand Duarte, 2003b). This pseudo 3D data set was complemented with a second \n\nchirp survey and a boomer survey, RIAV02 and RIAV03 (Pinheiro and Duarte, \n\n2003a; Pinheiro et al., 2003). All surveys were carried out onboard the launch Ria \n\nAzul of the Aveiro Harbor Authority. More than 220 km of chirp profiles were \n\ndigitally acquired with a Datasonics CAP-6000W Chirp sonar from the Marine \n\nGeology unit of LNEG (DGM-LNEG) during the RIAV02 and RIAV02A cruises. The \n\nsignal bandwidth was 1.5-10 kHz, the output power 1 kW, and the chirp length 10 \n\nms (approx. vertical resolution of 10-15 cm). During the RIAV03 cruise, 47 km of \n\nadditional boomer profiles (EG&amp;G Uniboom, also from DGM-LNEG) were also \n\nacquired. The output energy used was 100 W s-1, and the receiver array consisted \n\nof a single-channel streamer with 24 hydrophones. The signal frequency spectrum \n\nranged from 250 to 1,400 Hz (estimated vertical resolution&lt;2 m). \n\nSeismic processing was carried out with SPW software package (Seismic \n\nProcessing Workshop, from Parallel Geoscience Corporation), and with Radex Pro \n\n(from Deco Geophysical). The processing of the boomer records included \n\nfrequency band-pass filtering and time-variant amplitude gain correction. \n\nDeconvolution and Stolt-FK migration (single sound velocity model of 1500 m s-1) \n\nwere also applied on some of the boomer records. The estimated depths of the \n\nseismic reflections were calculated using velocities of 1,500 m s-1 for seawater, \n\nand 1,700 m s-1 as an average for soft sediments. The pseudo 3-D data set \n\nconsists of 18km of profiles, covering an area of 1000x150m, with inlines 10 m \n\napart and crosslines 40 m apart. The remainder boomer and chirp profiles have a \n\nmore heterogeneous layout, with a separation of roughly 50 m, and extend the \n\nseismic coverage northwestards onto the Cidade channel (see Fig. V-1). The ship \n\nspeed was about 4 knots. Dynamic positioning of the seismic profiles was done \n\nwith a Real Time Kynematic GPS. A constant time shift was applied to each profile \n\nto account for tidal fluctuations and the depth of the towed equipment (fish and \n\nstreamer). Residual misties for the pseudo 3-D data set do not exceed 0.5 ms \n\n 112 \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M.

SEG-Y seismic data management and interpretation was \n\ncarried out using the Kingdom Suite (Seismic Micro-technology Inc.) and the \n\nOpenworks and Seisworks-2D (Landmark Graphics Corporation) seismic \n\ninterpretation software packages.  \n\nHydrological and geotechnical probing of Ria of Aveiro is relatively \n\nextensive due to the intensive human occupation of the area. Cores drilled for \n\nhydrological purposes frequently aim at the confined aquifer lying below the \n\n\u201cArgilas de Aveiro\u201d formation of the Maestrichtian Sedimentary Complex (Teixeira \n\nand Zbyszewski, 1976), including descriptions of rocks down to the Middle \n\nCretaceous (Marques da Silva, 1992). The geotechnical log data of Standard \n\nPenetration Tests (SPTs) are usually shorter than the hydrogeological ones, \n\nnormally reaching the top of the Mesozoic consolidated sediments, usually the \n\n\u201cArgilas de Aveiro\u201d formation. Only a couple of hydrological core logs are available \n\nclose to the seismic profiles in the structurally more complex area of the lagoon \n\n(see core locations in Fig V-4). Still, these logs are close enough to the seismic \n\nprofiles to allow for a calibration of the main geological units. The geotechnical \n\nlogs are located near harbor infrastructures and the Terminal Sul area has been  \n\ndensely surveyed (see core locations in Fig. V-4). Over 120 geotechnical logs \n\nwere used for the calibration of the vertical datum of the seismic data and for the \n\ngeological interpretation. \n\nAll available borehole, seismic and geographical data were collated into a \n\nGIS database (ArcGis ESRI), which was used throughout this work for spatial \n\ncomputations. \n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFi\ngu\n\nre\n V\n\n-4\n: \n\nE\nxa\n\nm\npl\n\ne \nof\n\n g\neo\n\nte\nch\n\nni\nca\n\nl l\nog\n\ns \npl\n\not\nte\n\nd \non\n\n to\np \n\nof\n th\n\ne \nch\n\nirp\n a\n\nnd\n b\n\noo\nm\n\ner\n p\n\nro\nfil\n\nes\n u\n\nse\nd \n\nto\n c\n\nor\nre\n\nct\n th\n\ne \nve\n\nrt\nic\n\nal\n d\n\nat\num\n\n o\nf t\n\nhe\n p\n\nro\nfil\n\nes\n.

(to be submitted) \u2013 Structural and tidal controls on gas \n \n \n\n5.4. Results \nThe acoustic evidence of gas accumulation and seepage in the studied \n\narea consists of acoustic turbidity, enhanced reflections, acoustic blanking, \n\npockmarks and buried trough pockmarks, disrupted horizons, cloudy turbidity and \n\nacoustic plumes (flares) in the water column (see also Duarte et al., 2007). With \n\nthe exception of the pockmarks, buried trough pockmarks and the disrupted \n\nhorizons, all other types of evidence of gas were previously found and described in \n\nthe Espinheiro channel of the Ria of Aveiro (Duarte et al., 2007), and the terms \n\nused here respect the meanings described in that work. Pockmarks are a type of \n\ngas related features not found in previous work in the Espinheiro area. These are \n\ncircular to elliptical depressions with a common v-shaped cross-section, formed by \n\nfluid escape through the sediments that promote localized erosion and generate \n\ncircular to elliptical depressions in the water bottom. When this fluid escape is \n\nfocused through fractures, sometimes trough-like alignments of pockmarks occur \n\non the water bottom along the fracture line. Buried pockmarks are past fluid \n\nescape structures such as those just described that were filled by sediments \n\n(Hovland and Judd, 1988). The disrupted horizons observed in the seismic profiles \n\n(e.g. Figs. V-7 and V-11) are probable/possible fluid escape structures that consist \n\nof near vertical ruptures of consolidated layers that exhibit uncommon localized \n\ndeformation, indicating that hydraulic fracture processes may have contributed to \n\ntheir deformation.  \n\nAll the interpretation problems related to the specific seismic acquisition \n\nconditions in a shallow lagoon environment that Duarte et al. (2007) described in \n\nthe study of the Espinheiro channel, also occurred here, e.g. the survey coverage \n\nvariability, the frequent changes in profile direction, the strong and variable bottom \n\nmultiple interference caused by shallow water depths and tidal altitude changes \n\n(about 2 m in the present case), and the scarcity of reflections due to lack of \n\nsediment heterogeneity or the lack of signal penetration in sandy sediments, \n\nlimiting the identification of gas evidence. Taking into account these constraints, all \n\ngas related features identified in each profile were mapped for the Cidade channel \n\nand the Terminal Sul (see Figs. V-5 and V-6).

Distribution and extent of gas in the Terminal Sul \nsector \n\nThe Terminal Sul area has been covered by a very dense, pseudo-3D chirp \n\nprofile coverage, with inlines approximately every 10m and crosslines \n\napproximately every 50m, which allows a confident determination of the \n\ndistribution and extent of the areas of gas accumulation and mapping of the \n\nvarious seepage-related features. The evidence for gas in the Terminal Sul \n\nconsists of: (1) two gas accumulations, named here as Terminal Sul Western Gas \n\nField (TS-WGF) and Terminal Sul Eastern Gas Field (TS-EGF), (2) pockmarks \n\nand buried pockmarks, and (3) possible generalized gas accumulations within the \n\noutcropping/sub-cropping Mesozoic Marls and clays (Fig. V-5). \n\nThe TS-WGF gas field is characterized by acoustic blanking and acoustic \n\nturbidity covering an area of 60,440m2 (22% of the seismic coverage area of \n\nTerminal Sul). These accumulations occur approximately 1m below the channel \n\nfloor, and appear to be trapped underneath soft Holocene tidal channel deposits \n\n(black muds: Pinheiro and Duarte, 2002). An acoustic plume was observed \n\nascending from this gas pocket (see profiles over TS-WGF in Figs. V-7, V-8 and \n\nV-9). \n\nThe Mesozoic clays and marls outcrop or subcrop (less than 1 m below the \n\nchannel bottom) over a significant part of the Terminal Sul area. The majority of \n\nthese Mesozoic horizons have enhanced reflections that may result from either \n\ngas bubbles in the sediments, or sharp differences in the physical properties \n\nbetween the soft Holocene sediments and the consolidated Mesozoic marls and \n\nclays. The sharp changes in the patterns of enhanced reflections with tidal altitude \n\nsuggest that these enhancements are more likely related to gas bubbles in the \n\nsediments (see Fig. V-10). Pending confirmation of the presence of gas, the \n\nMesozoic enhanced reflections observed may correspond to an important gas \n\naccumulation zone with an area of 74,300m2 (27% of the seismic coverage area of \n\nTerminal Sul). \n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure V-6: Map of the acoustic evidence of gas accumulation and seepage in the Cidade channel. \n\n 118 \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M.

Gas evidence in the form of acoustic turbidity and enhanced \n\nreflections are common in the sediments that cover these pockmarks, raising the \n\npossibility that gas may still be rising through the pockmark structures.

The TS-\n\nEGF occurs near the top of the Mesozoic bedrock, 1 to 3m below the channel \n\nbottom. Here, the Mesozoic sediments are faulted and the eastern blocks are \n\ndownthrown to the East as confirmed by the geotechnical cores logs, more than \n\n15m down and do not intercept the Cretaceous \u201cArgilas de Aveiro\u201d formation.

Profile separation is locally irregular \n\nranging from a few meters to approximately 25m (see Fig. V-1), which means that \n\nsome smaller areas of gas accumulation areas were probably not imaged. The \n\nCidade channel has a gas field in its northern half (CC-NGF), and a few smaller \n\npatches of less unequivocal evidence of gas towards the south (Fig. V-6).  \n\nThe CC-NGF has an area of 31,460m2 (17% of the seismic coverage area \n\nof the Cidade Channel) and is mainly characterized by acoustic blanking. The \n\nacoustic blanking occurs below an enhanced reflection, approximately 1-2m below \n\nthe channel bottom, which clearly blocks the acoustic signal from the normally \n\nstrong Mesozoic reflectors below (see Fig. V-15). One relatively weak flare was \n\nobserved at the northern edge of this gas field, where the top of the acoustic \n\nblanking reaches the channel bottom (see Fig. V-15). \n\nThe CC-NGF occurs above folded and faulted Mesozoic horizons. The \n\nstructural pattern of strongly dipping faults with apparent reverse kinematics, with \n\nlimited spatial extension of the strain accommodation, is interpreted as a series of \n\nstrike-slip shear zones (see Fig. 16).

Also, the gas \n\naccumulation occurs specifically in the area above the disrupted Mesozoic clays \n\nand marls and is absent to the north and to the south of this disrupted zone (see \n\nFig V-17). The association between the shear zones that affect the Mesozoic \n\nbedrock and the overlying gas accumulation raises the possibility that the shear \n\nzones serve as fluid pathways and, also, that part of the intense strain \n\naccommodated by the Mesozoic bedrock were possibly caused by hydraulic \n\nfracturing processes. \n\nEvidence for gas in the southern half of the Cidade channel area is also \n\ncommo\n\n \n\n5.4.3.

V-20 and V-22). These clear spatial relations \n\nbetween fluid evidence and fault structures strongly suggest that the faults in the \n\nMesozoic bedrock constitute preferential fluid migration pathways.  \n\nThe disrupted horizons of the Mesozoic bedrock in the Cidade channel \n\nunderlie gas accumulations in trapped in the Holocene sediments. The Mesozoic \n\nstructure in this area follows the westerly gently dipping monocline\n\nent folding observed in the profiles appears to be a result of the intersection \n\nof an arcuate trackline with the west dipping monocline). The localized strain \n\nshown by the disrupted horizons materialize shear zones of flower structure \n\npatterns with general WNW-ESE trends (68\u00baW) suggestive of transpressive \n\ndeformation (both shortening and strike-slip). Considering the hypothesis that the \n\ngas accumulated in the Holocene sediments has escaped through the disrupted \n\nMesozoic horizons, then fluid escape in the Cidade channel is controlled by these \n\nWNW-ESE fractures of the Mesozoic (see Fig. V-22). The gas composition found \n\nuntil now in the Ria of Aveiro consists mainly of methane and, therefore appears to \n\nbe of biogenic origin. The interpretation proposed here raises the possibility of also \n\na potential deeper source for the gas. \n\nStratigraphic and geometrical evidence of the relative chronology and \n\nkynematics of the structures observed in the study areas is incomplete and, until \n\nfurther evidence is found, an explana\n\n be based on the proposed Meso-Cenozoic regional geodynamical evolution \n\nof the Western Iberian Margin. In this sense, the observed deformation can be \n\nexplained by the roughly E-W extension related to the late Cretaceous Atlantic \n\nrifting, and by the NW-SE convergence of the Eurasia and Africa plates during the \n\nMiocene (for an overview of post-Jurassic tectonics in Iberia see Wilson et al., \n\n1989; Ribeiro et al., 1990; Srivastava et al., 1990; Rasmussen et al., 1998; \n\nAndeweg, 2001; Alves et al., 2003). \n\nThe strain accommodated by the NNW-SSE and NNE-SSW normal faults \n\nprobably occurred during the late Cretaceous extension.

Considering \n\nthe widespread evidence of gas in the Ria of Aveiro, the stronger than expected \n\namplitudes during low tide with maxima during ebb may be explained by gas \n\nebullition and/or gas bubble size changes triggered by falling pressure with falling \n\ntide (Best et al., 2004). \n\n The methane gas bubbles obs\n\n\u201d pier of the Ria de Aveiro, outside the study areas, showed a similar pattern \n\nwith tidal altitude to the one between amplitude strengths and tidal altitude.

Discussion and conclusions \n \n\nEvidence of gas in the Terminal Sul and Cidade Channel covers \n\nrespectively, 28% and 31% of the total seismic coverage area, a value that, for the \n\nTerminal Sul, may reach 55% if the possible evidence for gas in the Mesozoic \n\nbedrock is added. The evidence occurs at a wide range of depths below the water \n\nsurface, from 3m downw to 15m. The distribution and extent of seismic evidence \n\nof gas in the Terminal Sul and Cidade Channel sectors, as well as, the increase in \n\nrelative extent and depth range of gas accumulations when compared to the 14% \n\narea and 4m depth of the gas accumulations in the Espinheiro Channel sector, \n\nave methodological and natural explanations. \n\nThe analysis of the data from the Espinheiro Channel (Chapter IV, Duarte \n\nhannel and Terminal Sul sectors.

This is particularly \n\nimportant when comparing the gas accumulation areas of the shallower Espinheiro \n\nChannel sector with the deeper Cidade C\n\nc\n\ns\n\nidentify diagnostic reflection patterns, thereby underestimating the extent of the \n\nmapped areas of gas accumulation. Furthermore, the distance between profiles in \n\nthe Espinheiro Channel sector reaches 75m which is three times more than the \n\nmaximum distance between profiles in the Terminal Sul and Cidade Channel \n\nsectors. This means that the extent of pockets of gas smaller than 75m is most \n\nprobably underestimated\n\nThe problems of the depth of the survey area and the profile separation in \n\nmapping gas accumulations with seismic methods have implications for the \n\nassessment of uncertainty of measured gas accumulation areas; these should be \n\naddressed in subsequent surveys. Mapping gas accumulations in shallow waters \n\nwill probably require a dense groundtruthing sampling for gas in order to clarify the \n\nexpectedly ambiguous seismic evidence of gas in shallow waters. If this \n\ndisambiguation through groundtruthing is\n\n 144 \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M. (to be submitted) \u2013 Structural and tidal controls on gas \n \n \n\ndata in shallow water will be limited to exploratory studies, i.e. to making new \n\nfindings of gas accumulations where observation conditions are optimal. The issue \n\nof vari\n\nconstant profile separation. In the \n\npresen\n\nting the existence of higher \n\nperme\n\nable profile separation is a problem of observation scale already discussed \n\nin Chapter III. The gas accumulations in the Ria of Aveiro have a wide range of \n\nsizes and shapes probably reflecting the sizes and shapes of the potential gas \n\ntraps, which in a coastal lagoon environment probably include a multitude of \n\nsediment bodies that fill small tidal channels. Furthermore, it is probably safe to \n\nassume that the size and extent of these gas traps have fractal properties; as \n\ndiscussed before (see Chapter III) this means that the interpretation and \n\ncomparison of maps of seismic evidence of gas accumulations require the use of a \n\nconstant scale of observation, in this case a \n\nt work, the Terminal Sul sector has the most regular profile separation and, \n\ntherefore, is the sector that provides the best conditions to study the size, \n\ndistribution and controls of the gas accumulations. \n\nThe distribution of the evidence of gas accumulation in the Terminal Sul \n\nand Cidade Channel sectors has strong spatial correlation with the fracture pattern \n\nof the Mesozoic bedrock (see Fig V-22). Since the Mesozoic structure appears to \n\nexert a control on the distribution of gas, this implies the existence of a fluid source \n\nin the Mesozoic bedrock. The corresponding fluid my be either rich in methane gas \n\nor have chemical properties that promote methanogenesis in the Holocene \n\nsediments. The study of the Espinheiro Channel sector already raised the \n\nhypothesis of a deeper source of methane (see chapter IV), and the data from the \n\nTerminal Sul and Cidade Channel again raises this possibility. The Mesozoic \n\nbedrock in Terminal Sul and Cidade Channel sectors has a denser fracture pattern \n\nwhen compared with the Espinheiro sector, indica\n\nability pathways for fluid migration. Furthermore, the Terminal Sul sector \n\nMesozoic bedrock appears to constitute a structural high that may function as a \n\ntrap for gas migrating from depth (Fig. V-20), which is in agreement with the \n\noccurrence of focused fluid escape structures such as the observed pockmarks \n\n(Figs. V-11, V-12 and V-13), as well as with the overall enhanced reflections in the \n\nMesozoic bedrock. \n\nThe relationship between the deformation history and fluid flow history is \n\n 145\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\n 146 \n\nunclear. The intensity of the strain accommodated by the disrupted horizons in the \n\nCidade Channel raises may be in part related to hydraulic fracturing processes. If \n\nthe fluids overpressure conditions necessary for such processes were achieved \n\nthrough seismic pumping then fluids may have migrated through the WNW-ESE \n\nand NNW-SSE faults during the Miocene inversion tectonic episodes. Reports of \n\nextensive fluid escape in the Ria of Aveiro were recorded in the XVIII century \n\nduring the 1755 Lisbon earthquake (Coelho, 2005; Oliveira, 2005). If these reports \n\nare true then, tele-seismic effects related to Quaternary tectonics may also be a \n\ndriving mechanism for fluid migration in the Ria of Aveiro. \n\nThe association between the gas escape and accumulation features in \n\nHolocene lagoon sediments and the Mesozoic bedrock structure is indicative that, \n\nwhether or not tectonic events were responsible for fluid flow, the present fractures \n\nare probably functioning as permeable pathways for fluid migration from depth to \n\nthe Holocene sediments and out to the Ria of Aveiro and to the atmosphere. This \n\nmeans that deeper older accumulations of gas are probably a source of the gas \n\naccumulating and escaping from the Holocene sediments.  \n\nThe existence of gas traps in the Holocene sediments also controls the \n\ndistribution and extent of gas accumulation and escape in the Terminal Sul and \n\nCidade Channels, as illustrated by acoustic turbidity in the sedimentary fills of the \n\nburied pockmarks in the Terminal Sul (Fig. V-13), and the extent of the CC-NGF \n\nand related gas escape evidence in the Cidade Channel (Fig. V-17). The \n\nimportance of the Holocene sediment architecture in the distribution of gas \n\naccumulations was also evident in the Espinheiro Channel sector, for the main gas \n\nfields appear to have been trapped within layers of a prograding sediment wedge \n\nand within layers of a tidal channel sedimentary fill (see Chapter IV; Duarte et al., \n\n2007). \n\nLocal changes in gas related seismic features (see Fig. V-10) as well as the \n\ndata on first break amplitudes from the Cidade Channel sector provide very strong \n\nevidence that tides have an effect on the acoustic response of gas rich sediments. \n\nThis effect will impact the mapped distribution and extent of gas evidence and its \n\nuse to quantify gas volumes. The relative increase in reflections amplitude during \n\ntidal fall probably reflects changes of methane solubility due to decreasing \n\n\n\nDuarte, H. &amp; Pinheiro, L.M.

The organic rich Holocene sediments \n\nare pro\n\nal changes in primary \n\nproduc\n\nd tidal channels of the Ria of Aveiro. Evidence of gas includes: acoustic \n\nturbidit\n\nbably a modern source of biogenic methane gas and bio-geochemical data \n\nis required to study the methane production. In fact, primary biological production, \n\na pre-requisite for biogenic methane production, is very high in coastal \n\nenvironments like the Ria of Aveiro (Kelley et al., 1995; Van der Nat and \n\nMiddelburg, 2000) and primary biological production and geochemical conditions \n\nof the Holocene organic rich sediments influence methane gas production, \n\naccumulation and escape patterns; factors such as season\n\ntion, water salinity, depth of oxygen reduction within the sediments, etc, all \n\nwill affect the location and extent of methane gas production (Hagen and Vogt, \n\n1999). \n\nAnthropogenic activity may also affect the distribution and extent of gas. \n\nThe Terminal Sul and Cidade Channel sectors in particular, are places of intense \n\nhuman activity with heavy construction, freight ship traffic, fishing and dredging. \n\nThese activities change the water and sediment chemistry, the morphology of the \n\nchannels, as well as strongly influence the hydrodynamics of the lagoon. \n\nIn summary, the seismic evidence of gas covers approximately one third of \n\nsurveye\n\ny, enhanced reflections, acoustic blanking, pockmarks and buried trough \n\npockmarks, disrupted horizons and acoustic plumes in the water column (flares). \n\nThe tidal altitude variations impact the detection of gas with seismic methods. \n\nReflection amplitudes in gas-prone areas are clearly stronger during low tide with \n\nmaxima during ebb, decreasing with flood with minima during high tide; this \n\npattern confirms that ebullition and gas escape is triggered mainly by the decrease \n\n 147\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\nof pressure (hydraulic load) that occurs during the falling tide. The location and \n\ngeometry of fluid the escape features follows the fracture pattern that affects the \n\nMesozoic bedrock, indicating that these fractures are preferential pathways for \n\nfluid migration and exert a structural control on the gas occurrences in the Ria of \n\nAveiro. This structural control raises the hypothesis of the existence of a deep \n\nsource of methane, possibly thermogenic, in or below the Mesozoic bedrock. \n\n 148 \n\n\n\nConclusions and future work \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 6. Conclusions and future work \n \n\nThe subject of this thesis was the investigation of gas accumulation and \n\nseepage in the Ria of Aveiro barrier-lagoon using high resolution seismic reflection \n\nmethods. The main problems addressed ranged from practical aspects of \n\nobservation and data acquisition to questions related to the study of natural \n\nprocesses. The three main questions that were addressed were: \n\n1. What are the best procedures to acquire and process seismic reflection \n\ndata in a shallow barrier-lagoon environment? \n\n2. What are the types of seismic evidence of gas accumulation and seepage \n\nin the tidal channels of the Ria of Aveiro and what is the appropriate way to \n\nmap them? \n\n3. What are the geological controls on gas accumulation and seepage in the \n\ntidal channels of the Ria of Aveiro? \n\nThis final chapter presents a summary of the results obtained when trying to \n\nanswer these questions, discusses the main issues that arose from this \n\ninvestigation and proposes guidelines for future work in the study of gas \n\ngeneration and flow in the Ria of Aveiro, also applicable to other similar coastal \n\nenvironments. \n\n \n\n6.1. Acquisition and processing of high resolution \nseismic reflection data in a shallow water environments \n\n \n\nHigh resolution seismic reflection methods present significant advantages \n\nfor the investigation of the sub-surface geology in shallow barrier-lagoon \n\nenvironments. The ability to survey the water column and sub-surface geology, \n\nboth in time and space, over extensive areas of difficult access, provided the \n\nopportunity to make several new discoveries in the Ria of Aveiro, and illustrates \n\nthe value of the use of seismic reflection in such an environment. \n\n 149\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\nNevertheless, seismic reflection systems have some limitations when \n\napplied in coastal environments. The ship traffic, tides, channel morphology and \n\nshallow bathymetry affects the deployment and operation of the seismic systems \n\nas well as restricts the extent of the profile coverage. The heterogeneity of the \n\nseismic coverage, signal quality, penetration and resolution all constrain the use of \n\nthe data to mostly local but detailed interpretations and modeling of the geological \n\nobjects. \n\nConsidering all these constraints, control of the acquisition geometry of the \n\nseismic systems and navigation systems and reliable information of tidal altitude \n\nvariations during acquisition are of paramount importance. It was shown here that, \n\nwhen acquiring seismic data in an environment such as the Ria of Aveiro, changes \n\nin the system geometry parameters that may be safely disregarded in surveys of \n\nmuch larger scope (i.e. significantly greater profile separation) have to be well \n\ncontrolled. Changes of few meters in acquisition geometry such as the depth or \n\nthe layback of the towed equipment, have significant impact on the accuracy and \n\nconsistency of the interpretation of geological features (e.g. fault plane \n\nmorphology, see chapter III). Also of significant importance for data positioning is \n\nthe synchronization of the seismic acquisition and navigation systems. Trace \n\npositioning estimates depend strongly on matching the data timestamps of each \n\nsystem and, given acquisition speeds of 4-6 knots, a single second of \n\nsynchronization error results in a 1-2m positioning error. \n\nThe processing flows for the navigation data and the seismic signal \n\ndeveloped in the scope of this thesis improves and constrains the uncertainties in \n\ndata positioning and interpretability of the seismic features. The case of the Ria of \n\nAveiro shows that position estimates obtained through navigation data processing \n\nresulted in a mean horizon mistie value of 0.75ms, which allowed a confident \n\ncorrelation of the interpretation between profiles, without which mapping of the \n\nseismic evidence of gas would have been very difficult. Furthermore, the quality of \n\nthe trace position estimates of the pseudo 3D Chirp survey in the Terminal Sul \n\nsector was clearly illustrated by the consistency and detail of the gas evidence, \n\nhorizon isobats and structural maps. These maps allowed the identification of the \n\nspatial relationships between evidence of gas, sediment architecture and the \n\n 150 \n\n\n\nConclusions and future work \n \n \n\n 151\n\nMesozoic bedrock structure in the Terminal Sul, which was a major objective of \n\nthis thesis. \n\nThe seismic signal processing improves not only signal to noise ratio, but \n\nalso the geometric interpretability of the seismic/geological features. Of particular \n\nimportance are the normal moveout correction and the Stolt F-K migration \n\nprocesses. The normal moveout correction of boomer data allows the correct \n\ncorrelation of the interpretation between chirp and boomer profiles in very shallow \n\ndomains, such as those found in certain parts of the Espinheiro Channel sector. \n\nThe Stolt F-K Migration has significant impact in collapsing diffraction from point \n\ndiffractors in the Holocene sediments, improving profile interpretability and in \n\nimproving the geometry of channels and deformation structures.  \n\nConcerning the issues of acquisition and processing of the seismic data, it \n\nshould be emphasized here that best processing results are only accomplished \n\nafter strong quality control procedures involving the analysis of the track line \n\nregularity, horizon misties and first-break surface models, which allows the \n\nrevision and improvement of the processing parameters. \n\nThe main priority regarding future work in acquisition and processing of \n\nseismic data in shallow coastal environments is related to the most important \n\nlimitation of seismic reflection methods. Models derived solely from geophysical \n\nmethods, methods of indirect observation, require testing through groundtruthing. \n\nIn this work, groundtruthing was mostly provided by available borehole log data, \n\ncritical for the calibration of the seismic stratigraphy, but of no practical use in \n\ndetermining if specific reflections were caused by gas in the sediments. In the \n\ncase of the Ria of Aveiro, direct observation of gas escape from the sediments, in \n\nother locations of the lagoon, provides support for the interpretation of the seismic \n\nevidence of gas. Nevertheless, future work must take into account that it is \n\nimportant that the reflector(s) responsible for the reflection events interpreted as \n\ngas are identified through groundtruthing at the surveyed locations. Furthermore, \n\ngroundtruthing should be done, if possible, at the time of the seismic surveying in \n\norder to prevent errors in testing due to the temporal variations in gas generation, \n\naccumulation and flow. \n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\nAs concerns the practical aspects of seismic acquisition and data \n\nprocessing, the following improvements will increase the range of usability and \n\nreliability of seismic surveying in shallow coastal environments such as the Ria of \n\nAveiro: \n\n \n\n1. Maintain a constant acquisition speed. Considering that this requirement is \n\nextremely difficult to respect in environments such as the Ria of Aveiro, \n\nthen binning and stacking of the trace data should also be considered in \n\norder to obtain a constant trace separation; \n\n \n\n2. Follow survey plans with regularly spaced, orthogonal profiles, both to \n\nimprove interpretability and to maintain a constant observation scale,  \n\nallowing for the comparison of Euclidian properties of the geological \n\nfeatures to be mapped; \n\n \n\n3. Improve real time synchronization of the clocks of the seismic acquisition \n\nand navigation systems, either through hardware or software; automate the \n\npositioning estimate procedure during acquisition in order to allow quality \n\ncontrol of the data and cut post-processing times; \n\n \n\n4. Acquire navigation data exactly above source and receivers, e.g. placing \n\nGPS antennas over the towed equipment. This will provide accurate \n\ngeometry parameters for navigation and geometry related seismic signal \n\nprocessing; \n\n \n\n5. Acquire 3D Kinematic GPS data to estimate source and receiver altitudes \n\nand infer tidal altitude for each trace, thus bypassing the need to measure \n\ntidal altitudes at control stations and having to resort to tide propagation \n\nmodels within the lagoon to estimate tidal altitudes for each trace location. \n\n \n\n6.

In the case of chirp data, this would require recording \n\ndata in raw or pre-envelope processing formats; \n\n \n\n6.2. Seismic evidence of gas accumulation and seepage  \n \n\nSeismic evidence of gas accumulations in the Holocene sediments and \n\npossibly, in the Mesozoic bedrock of the Ria of Aveiro are extensive, covering 14% \n\nto 55% of the surveyed tidal channels area. Types of seismic evidence for gas \n\naccumulations in the study area included acoustic turbidity, enhanced reflections \n\nand acoustic blanking. Gas escape through the water column was also detected \n\nas acoustic flares and, possibly, cloudy turbidity. Of particular interest for such a \n\ndynamic system as the Ria of Aveiro was the finding of mounds and pockmarks \n\nthat indicated that gas generation and flow in the sediments of the lagoon may \n\nhave played a role in shaping the morphology of the tidal channels. The \n\nrelationships between the structure of the Mesozoic bedrock and the overlying \n\nlagoon sediments were also clarified by the new seismic data. Also, the high \n\nresolution and density of the seismic profiles allowed the geometrical \n\ncharacterization of a 2km wide, 50m deep graben and of families of fractures that \n\nappear to exert a structural control on the extent and distribution of gas. \n\nFurthermore, the high resolution of the Chirp and Boomer systems allowed the \n\nmapping of the typically small gas accumulations (30 to 150m long), whose size \n\nprobably reflects that of the host sedimentary bodies. \n\nSearching for seismic evidence of gas in tide-dominated environments such \n\nas the Ria of Aveiro had unexpected results. Comparison of seismic profiles \n\nacquired at different tidal altitudes and the statistical analysis of changes of first \n\nbreak amplitude strengths with changing tidal altitude, together revealed that the \n\nseismic records changed significantly during the tidal cycle.Independent \n\nobservation of tidal fall triggered methane ebullition in other locations of the lagoon \n\nsupport the hypothesis that gas ebullition is being detected by the seismic systems \n\nand that, therefore one needs to be careful when using acoustic methods to map \n\ngas accumulations in tidal dominated environments, because areas with a similar \n\namount of methane content in the sediments may produce a different acoustic \n\n 153\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\nresponse, depending on the stage of the tidal cycle during which they where \n\nsurveyed. \n\nThe impact of tidal fall triggered ebullition on the seismic records can be \n\nviewed as a constraint on future work, but also as an opportunity. In fact, future \n\nsurveying can be planned to study the diurnal dynamics of gas generation and \n\nflow in a 4D perspective, through qualitative and quantitative analysis of the \n\nreflection data. Such data, coupled with bio-geochemical analysis of sediment, \n\npore water, and water column samples, would provide the input data necessary to \n\nmodel short term generation and flow of methane gas in the Ria of Aveiro and \n\nsimilar environments. \n\n \n\n6.3. Geological controls on gas accumulation and \nseepage \n\n \n\nThe geological controls on gas accumulation and seepage in the tidal \n\nchannels of the Ria of Aveiro are shown in the diagrams for each sector shown in \n\nFig. VI-1, and are summarized below. \n\n \n\n1. The Holocene prograding wedge and the tidal channel fill deposits \n\n(Espinheiro sector) and Quaternary (Holocene?) sediments of unknown \n\nnature (Terminal Sul Sector) are probable producers of biogenic gas of the \n\nRia of Aveiro. \n\n2. Gas accumulations occur in the gas producing sediments and beneath what \n\nappear to be impermeable horizons, such as those occurring in the \n\nHolocene marine/lagoonal sediments of the Cidade channel and in the \n\nsediment fills of the buried pockmarks of the Terminal Sul.  \n\n3. Evidence of widespread gas accumulation in the Mesozoic bedrock, \n\nevidence of fluid escape structures (pockmarks) and gas accumulations on \n\nthe hanging walls of the major extensional faults that bound the structural \n\nhigh of the Mesozoic bedrock in the Terminal Sul, all suggest that structural \n\nhighs in the bedrock also constitute traps for gas migrating from depth.  \n\n 154 \n\n\n\nConclusions and future work \n \n \n\n \n \nFigure VI-1: Proposed interpretation for the gas accumulation and seepage in the three studied \ntidal channel sectors of the Ria of Aveiro (not to scale). See text for further explanation. \n\n 155\n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\n4. The accumulation and seepage of gas in the sediments affects the \n\nmorphology of the tidal channels in the form of pockmarks (70x40x2m, \n\nTerminal Sul sector) and gas domes (40x20x2m, Espinheiro sector). \n\n \n\n5. The dynamics of gas flow and escape from the sediments is controlled by \n\nthe tidal cycle, with falling tides causing ebullition. Focused fluid seepage \n\noccurs in the form of gas escaping from accumulations in the sediments, \n\nbuilding bubble trains that rise through the water column (evident in every \n\nstudied sector of the lagoon). \n\n \n\n6.4. Future work \n \n\nThe present work provides strong evidence on the occurrence and controls \n\non gas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro. Given the exploratory \n\nnature of much of the research done, several key issues such as the seasonality \n\nof gas generation and seepage or the methane flow rates to the atmosphere could \n\nnot be tackled and must be addressed in the future, in order to create a \n\ncomprehensive model on gas generation and flow. \n\nConsidering that gas accumulations are extensive in the Ria of Aveiro, that \n\ngas escapes to the water column and the atmosphere, and that gas generation \n\nand flow affects morphology of the tidal channel floor, it is clear that the Ria of \n\nAveiro is an excellent natural laboratory to study gas generation and flow in \n\ncoastal sediments. Future work should emphasize two main questions, the first \n\nrelated to energy and climate issues, and the second related to geomorphology \n\ndynamics. \n\n \n\n1. How much of the gas generated in the lagoon escapes to the water column \n\nand atmosphere? Conversely, how much of the gas generated in the \n\nlagoon remains trapped in the sediments?  \n\n \n\nThe answer to this question will provide valuable information on the \n\nextrinsic and intrinsic factors that determine the capacity of a coastal system to \n\n 156 \n\n\n\nConclusions and future work \n \n \n\n 157\n\ntrap or lose the methane generated in the sediments. Such knowledge will provide \n\nenergy exploration guidelines to find gas trapping coastal systems (modern and \n\npast), as well as inform climate models on the relative importance of coastal \n\nsystems as a source of atmospheric methane.  \n\n \n\n2. Does fluid escape from the sediments exert a control on location and \n\nmorphology of tidal channels? More specifically for the case of the Ria of \n\nAveiro, is fluid escape the process through which the bedrock structure \n\n(faults and other permeable fluid migration pathways), buried beneath \n\nseveral meters of Holocene sediments, exerts a control on the location and \n\nmorphology of the channels that mimic bedrock fault trends? \n\n \n\nModern drainage basins frequently show patterns that mimic deep seated \n\nstructures without any apparent cause. The evidence of morphology shaping due \n\nto gas generation and flow in the Ria of Aveiro, a very dynamic system, provides \n\nan explanatory hypothesis for a mechanism of morphology control by deep \n\nstructure: fluid escape from the sediments is capable of influencing erosion-\n\ntransport-deposition patterns, thus shaping morphology.  \n\n\n\nGas accumulation and seepage in the Ria of Aveiro \n \n \n\n 158 \n\n\n\nReferences \n \n \n\nReferences \n \n\nAbecasis, C.
