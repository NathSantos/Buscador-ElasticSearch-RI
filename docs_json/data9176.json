Os p\u00f3s\nprecursores consistem numa composi\u00e7\u00e3o estequeom\u00e9trica de minerais \u00e0 base \nde alumina, talco, ?-quartzo, K-feldspato, caolinite e mulite, bem como uma \npequena quantidade de calcite, cristobalite e fases v\u00edtreas derivadas da\nmoloquite, obtidas pela calcina\u00e7\u00e3o da caolinite a elevadas temperaturas\n(1550\u00baC). \nOs corpos em verde consolidados por enchimento por barbotina foram \nsinterizados ao ar a diferentes temperaturas: 1050, 1150, 1250, 1350, 1425 e\n1500\u00b0C. Os resultados obtidos por difrac\u00e7\u00e3o de Raios-X mostraram que a \ncristaliza\u00e7\u00e3o ocorre entre 1250 e 1350\u00baC e que a composi\u00e7\u00e3o inclui n\u00e3o s\u00f3\ncordierite mas tamb\u00e9m mulite, alumina e quartzo residual. Aumentando a\ntemperatura de sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o para 1500\u00baC, a \u00fanica fase cristalina detectada \u00e9 a\nmulite, juntamente com uma elevada frac\u00e7\u00e3o de porosidade envolta por uma\nabundante fase v\u00edtrea.   \nAl\u00e9m dos efeitos originados pela temperatura, a sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m\ndependente do tempo. Por este motivo, o tratamento t\u00e9rmico foi efectuado ao\nfim de 2, 4 e 8 h de patamar de modo a relacionar as composi\u00e7\u00f5es obtidas\ncom o tempo de sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o. As composi\u00e7\u00f5es obtidas \u00e0 base de cordierite-\nmulite-alumina apresentam baixo coeficiente de expans\u00e3o t\u00e9rmico 2~4x10-6/K \ne resist\u00eancia \u00e0 flex\u00e3o relativamente elevada, 90~120 MPa. As amostras\nsinterizadas a 1250\u00baC durante 2 e 4 h apresentam os valores mais elevados de\nresist\u00eancia ao choque t\u00e9rmico (?T~350-400 K). \n \nAl\u00e9m destas propriedades, os materiais \u00e0 base de cordierite tamb\u00e9m\napresentam baixa constante diel\u00e9ctrica (entre 5 e 10) e um baixo factor de\nperda diel\u00e9ctrica, o que faz deles materiais com forte potencial para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es\nem circuitos integrados como substratos diel\u00e9ctricos. A constante diel\u00e9ctrica\nem fun\u00e7\u00e3o da temperatura foi medida desde a temperatura ambiente at\u00e9\n600\u00baC, tendo-se verificado estabilidade das propriedades diel\u00e9ctricas a 1 MHz\nem toda a gama de temperaturas testada.   \n \n \nAs propriedades reol\u00f3gicas das suspens\u00f5es \u00e0 base de cordierite foram \noptimizadas de forma a obter uma boa impregna\u00e7\u00e3o do pol\u00edmero. As\npropriedades mec\u00e2nicas das espumas cer\u00e2micas obtidas pelo m\u00e9todo de\nreplica\u00e7\u00e3o da espuma polim\u00e9rica foram caracterizadas com base nas \npropriedades dos cer\u00e2micos densos. O m\u00f3dulo de Young foi determinado pelo \nm\u00e9todo de excita\u00e7\u00e3o por impulso. A teoria micro-mec\u00e2nica para materiais \nheterog\u00e9neos conhecida como m\u00e9todo de \u201cMori-Tanaka\u201d foi aplicada para \nestimar o m\u00f3dulo efectivo das espumas cer\u00e2micas. Dos resultados obtidos\nverifica-se um desfasamento entre os valores experimentais (1~2 GPa) e os \nte\u00f3ricos (6~7 GPa). A tomografia computadorizada por Rais-X foi usada para \nestudar a estrutura tridimensional (3D) das espumas cer\u00e2micas por an\u00e1lise de \nelementos finitos (FEA). As propriedades el\u00e1sticas foram estudadas pelo\nc\u00e1lculo da for\u00e7a de reac\u00e7\u00e3o na deforma\u00e7\u00e3o el\u00e1stica. Embora a estrutura\ntridimensional calculada das espumas cer\u00e2micas represente apenas uma\npequena frac\u00e7\u00e3o da estrutura, os resultados mostram que a correla\u00e7\u00e3o entre\neles \u00e9 fortemente melhorada pelo m\u00e9todo de Mori-Tanak. A raz\u00e3o apontada \npara o desfasamento \u00e9 a exist\u00eancia de uma estrutura interna oca, que n\u00e3o \u00e9\ntida em conta no modelo utilizado. Por outro lado, o m\u00e9todo CT mostra que a \nestrutura porosa e a diferen\u00e7a no microestrutura poder\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m ser simulada.\nO resultado da an\u00e1lise de elementos finitos mostrou que as espumas\ncer\u00e2micas s\u00e3o muito quebradi\u00e7as, o que \u00e9 consistente com a observa\u00e7\u00e3o\nexperimental obtida nos testes de compress\u00e3o.   \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n \n\nCordierite, Ceramics, Cellular structure &amp; foam, Impulse Excitation method, \nMori-Tanaka method, X-ray Computed Tomography, Finite Element Analysis. \n \n\n\n\nabstract \n \n\nCordierite ceramics have excellent thermal expansion and thermal shock \nresistance for applications such as refractory materials. The precursor powder \nconsisted of a non-stoichiometric composition of minerals containing corundum, \ntalc, ?-quartz, K-feldspar, kaolinite and mullite as well as small amount of \ncalcite, Cristobalite and glass phases probably derived from molochite, \nproduced by calcining kaolinite at high temperature (1550 \u00baC). The green \nconsolidates were sintered in air at 1050, 1150, 1250, 1350, 1425 and 1500\u00b0C. \nIt was discovered by XRD that cordierite crystallization takes place between \n1250 oC and 1350 oC while the composition includes not only cordierite but also \nmullite and alumina and residual quartz. At 1425oC, the ceramics consisted of \ncordierite and mullite. With further increasing the sintering temperature to 1500 \noC mullite was the single crystalline phase detected, together with a high \nporosity fraction embedded in an abundant glassy phase. Besides the \ntemperature effects, sintering was also time-dependent, therefore heat \ntreatment was conducted for 2, 4 and 8 h to study the sintering time\u2013\ncomposition relationships. The cordierite-mullite-alumina heterogeneous \nceramics were obtained with low thermal expansion coefficient of 2~4x10-6/K \nand relatively high flexural strength of 90~120 MPa. Thermal shock resistance \nmeasurements demonstrated that the samples sintered at 1250 oC for 2 h and \n4 h exhibited the highest thermal shock resistance values (?T~350-400 K). \n \nCordierite ceramics also exhibited very low dielectric constant (between 5 and \n10) and low dielectric loss factor, showing a good potential for low dielectric \nsubstrate applications in integrated circuits. The dielectric constant as function \nof temperature was measured from RT to 600oC, demonstrating to have very \nstable dielectric properties at 1 MHz across the entire temperature range.  \n \nThe cordierite slurries were prepared with optimized rheological properties and \nimpregnation conditions to coat the polymer struts by dip casting. The \nmechanical properties of ceramics foams fabricated by polymer replica method \nwere characterised on basis of properties of bulk ceramics. The foam\u2019s \neffective Young\u2019s modulus was determined by Impulse excitation method. \nMicro-mechanical theory for heterogeneous material known as \u201cMori-Tanaka\u201d \nmethod was applied to model the effective modulus of ceramics foam. The \nresults showed that the agreement was not good between experimental (1~2 \nGPa) and modelling (6~7 GPa) data. In the meantime, Computed X-ray \ntomography was applied to study the actual 3D structure of ceramic foams for \nFinite Element Analysis (FEA). Elastic properties were studied by calculating \nthe reaction force in elastic deformation. Although the calculated 3D structure \nof the ceramic foams represents only small fraction of the structure, the results \nshowed that the agreement has greatly improved over Mori-Tanaka method. \nThe reason of disagreement from the former method is the existence of internal \nhollow structure in ceramics struts, which is not taken into account in the \nmodel. On the other hand, CT method revealed the hollowed structure and the \ninfluence of such microstructure could be simulated. The FEA also showed that \nthe ceramic foams are very brittle, which is consistent with the experimental \nobservation under compression tests. \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials

in Earth crust and mantle at ~ 88 wt.% (wikipedia). It has wide-ranging of industrial \napplications such as filler for joining SiC with excellent properties of wetting on SiC substrate \nwhich produced high flexural strength (342-480 MPa) up to high temperature of 800 oC [1]; kiln \nfurniture due to their low density, good mechanical strength, incompressibility and thermal \ninsulation properties; catalyst support [2, 3] as well as refractory material to develop components \nin rocket nozzle and coatings on turbine gas engine thanks to its excellent thermal shock \nresistance [4]. In recent years, this class of materials has attracted an increasing attention from \nfoundry industry owing to the fact that ceramics foam made of MAS ceramics could be used as \nfilters to molten metals in casting processes to increase the homogeneity and stability of the metal \nflow. Among them, cordierite ceramics is an interesting phase due to its excellent \nthermo-mechanical properties. Cordierite is a high temperature phase in MAS \nphase-temperature-composition diagram which was firstly studied by Rankin et al [5] in 1918. \nTherefore, cordierite ceramics are not so popular and in most cases they are only found in nature \nnearer volcanoes where high temperature is available. In Fig. 1.1 an illustration of MAS ternary \nphase diagram (TPD) is shown and several key phases are highlighted.  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 1.1: Ternary Phase Diagrams for Ceramicists [6] \n\n \nThe TPD shows that upon compositions and temperatures, cordierite can transform into \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 2\n\nmullite or co-exist with alumina. The stoichiometry based on TPD in Fig. 1.1 shows monolithic \ncordierite has molar ratio of 2MgO:2Al2O3:5SiO2, hence the chemical formula of cordierite is \nMg2Al4Si5O18. This corresponding to a composition of 13.7 wt.% MgO, 34.9 wt.% Al2O3 and \n51.4 wt.% SiO2. Under stoichiometric condition, the cordierite is crystallized at temperature \naround 1460 K or 1187 oC. However, most synthesis usually starts from powders of \nnon-stoichiometric composition; consequently, cordierite, ?-quartz, corundum and mullite are \nlikely to co-exist with different heating schedules. Composite of cordierite and mullite are most \nlikely seen co-existing due to Mg-deficiency in the precursor and they are similar in physical \nproperties, but very different in mechanical and thermal expansion coefficients. The summary of \nproperties of Cordierite and Mullite as well as two other MAS materials, Corundum and ?-quartz \nare given in Table 1.1 (next page).  \n\n \nLogvinkov et al [7] studied the phase transition between corundum, mullite and cordierite \n\nunder heat treatment. The study analyzed the phase composition after heat treatment for 2h at \n1400 oC, 1450 oC and 1500 oC and cooled with various procedures. The heat treatment \ntemperatures correspond to the subsolidus in phase diagram as seen in Fig. 1.1. In [7] the phase \ntransition take places around subsolidus region and the solid state chemical reaction at four  \ngeneric temperature ranges are summarized below:  \n \n\n(1) T?988 oC: \n     10MgSiO3+2MgO-Al2O3=5Mg2SiO4 (forsterite)+ Mg2Al4Si5O18 (Cordierite) \n\n(2) 988 oC<T<1386 oC: \n2Mg2Al4Si5O18+15Al2O3=4MgAl2O4 (Spinel)+5Al6Si2O13(Mullite) \n\n(3) 1386 oC<T<1460 oC: \n4Al6Si2O13+ Mg4Al10Si2O23(Sapphirine)=13Al2O3+2Mg2Al4Si5O18 \n\n(4) T>1460 oC: \n4MgAl2O4+ Al6Si2O13=2Al2O3+ Mg4Al10Si2O23 \n\n \nIt appears that cordierite can be obtained at lower temperature. However, the aforementioned \n\nsolid state reaction route is on assumption that precursor materials are pure oxides. In real cases, \nthe non-stoichiometry in precursor powder could cause significantly altered results of final \ncomposition, for instance the cordierite will not be found around 1000 oC in reaction (1); Spinel is \nalso limited to form in reaction (2) which causes deficiency of spinel in reaction (4). Therefore \nthe final composition above 1460 oC is pure mullite without Sapphirine.  \n\n \n \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 3\n\n \n \n  Table 1.1: Physica, Mechanical, Thermal and Electrical properties MAS minerals [8] \n\nMineral name Corundum(99.5%) ?-Quartz Mullite Cordierite \n\nPhysical     \nChemical Formula Al2O3 SiO2 3Al2O3-SiO2 2MgO-2Al2O3-5SiO2\nDensity,  g/cm3 3.89** 2.21 2.8 2.6 \nWater Absorption wt.% \n(R.T.) 0.5 - 3.0 0 0 0.02 - 3.2 \n\nHardness, Moh's 1.0 - 1.5 7 8 7 \n\nMechanical     \nCompressive Strength, MPa 2600 650 - 1100 551 350 \nTensile Strength, MPa 4.8 48 103.5 25.5 \nModulus of Elasticity, GPa 375** 70 150 70 \nFlexural Strength (MOR), \nMPa 379** 80 170 117 \n\nPoisson's Ratio, ? 0.22** 0.17 0.25 0.21 \n\nFracture Toughness, KIc, \nMPa x m1/2 4** - 2 -- \n\nThermal     \nMax.

Low temperature cordierite has a completely \nordered orthorhombic structure (Cccm) with unit cell parameter a~17.06 \u00c5, b~9.74 \u00c5, c~9.34 \u00c5, \n?=90, ?=90, ?=90, [10-12]. At higher temperature it transforms into a hexagonal structure \n(P6/mmc) with lattice parameters a~9.7437 \u00c5, b~9.7437 \u00c5, c~9.3893 \u00c5, ?=90, ?=90, ?=120 [10, \n13] with long range ordering of Al and Si stable at about 1450 \u00b0C, before melting at 1460 \u00b0C. The \nunit cells of two crystal systems are shown in Fig. 1.2 respectively. The low temperature phase is \nmetastable high quartz solid solution, commonly referred to \u00b5-cordierite and its high temperature \nphase is known as ?-cordierite with hexagonal structure that very slowly transforms to \northorhombic cordierite below 1450 oC following the crystallization of \u00b5-cordierite [10]. \n\n \n\n           \n                    \n\nFig.1.2: crystal structure: (left) orthorhombic, \u00b5-phase; (right) hexagonal, ?-phase; \n \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 5\n\nThe unit cell consists of octahedrons of Mg coordinated by 6 oxygen and tetrahedrons \ncentred at Si and Al that are coordinated by 4 oxygens. However the octahedron and tetrahedron \nare geometrically asymmetric with different Mg-O-Mg, Al-O-Al or O-Mg-O and O-Al-O bond \nangles indicated in Fig. 1.3. The angle between the O and Al are 97.36o, 110.15o and 121.83o \nrespectively. The Si atoms are also coordinated in tetrahedral structure however the distortion of \nthe tetrahedron is less than that of Al-coordinated tetrahedrons. The angle between oxygen and \nsilicon in tetrahedron are 108.67o, 110.40o, 110.34o. The octahedrons and tetrahedrons are \ninterconnected within each other and form a complex molecular ring network shown in Fig. 1.4. \nThe cordierite structure usually gives its bulk density (~2.5 g/cm3).  \n\n \n\n        \nFig. 1.3: (left) Mg-coordinated octahedrons; (right) Al-coordinated tetrahedrons and \n\nSi-coordinated tetrahedrons \n \n\n \nFig. 1.4: overview of ?-cordierite crystal structure from c-axis of the unit cell \n\n \nThe low thermal expansion coefficient of ?-cordierite is the result of its relatively \u2018flexible\u2019 \n\ntetrahedral ring framework, and the anisotropic expansion of the octahedral framework of \n?-cordierite structure [11]. On the other hand, the ring structure-property relation was studied by \nMirwald et al [12] from XRD data revealing that low thermal expansion is due to the ring rather \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 6\n\nthan silicates framework. No indication for structural modifications correlated with symmetry \nchanges was observed during heating. Hochella et al [13] attempted to correlate the thermal \nexpansion properties of cordierite with structural changes as a function of increasing temperature. \nThe result was found that the expansion of a particular silicate framework depends on the \ntemperature response of the framework itself involving Al\u2013O\u2013Al and O\u2013Al\u2013O angular changes, \nthe expansion coefficient(s) of the non-tetrahedral bonds, if present, and the interplay between \nthese two factors. This interplay of the tetrahedral framework is associated with the change in \nbond angles contributing towards lower expansion in space. The general idea is rather similar that \ncordierite structure has tetrahedral unit with different angles of O-Al-O/Al-O-Al as well as \noctahedral unit with variable angle of Mg-O-Mg and O-Mg-O as shown in Fig. 1.3. The structure \nis very flexible to re-arrange in space upon heating the interatomic distance is likely to increase \nhowever the increase will not result in volume due to re-arrangement of the tetrahedral and \noctahedral units. This gives cordierite very low expansion in volume upon heating compared to \nother mineral with more rigid structure i.e., Alumina or metals. However, one exception is that \ndiamond has also very low TEC~1x10-6/K and this is due to strong C-C bond which is highly \nresistant to thermal excitation. Hochella &amp; Brown\u2019s attempt to correlated the very low TEC of \ncordierite to silicate framework structure in terms of stuffing cation (Mg in case of cordierite) and \nbond angles in the tetrahedral framework could not find a general mechanism for framework \nstructure-thermal expansion relationship and concluded that the thermal expansion in cordierite is \ncomplex and variable [13]. Later, Roy et al [14] revisited the works in very low thermal \nexpansion materials and claimed that the Mg stuffing plays a direct role in controlling thermal \nexpansion because of large variation of Mg-O bond. Furthermore, they discussed that the key \nfeatures that very low thermal expansion materials such as cordierite must have are: i) presence of \nstructural holes, ii) flexible but rigid network of strongly bonded polyhedron. These are two main \ncriteria for very low thermal expansion materials that cordierite satisfies both of them.   \n \n\nCordierite ceramics found important applications in thermal-mechanical engineering used as \nrefractory materials with the \u201cMaximum use Temperature\u201d up to 1371 oC (Table 1.1). It also \nshows excellent thermal shock resistance (TSR) behaviour as Oliveira et al [15] studied dense and \nfoam\u2019s TSR by rapidly transferring the specimens from resistance furnace into distilled water and \nmeasured the retained flexural strength. The dense cordierite ceramics show half way reduction \n(67 to 40 MPa) of flexural strength at ?T~325 K; and the flexural strength dropped to 1/3 or 1/4 \nof original value at ?T=375 K [15]. Acimovic et al [16] studied the application of cordierite \nceramics in foundry and parameters in producing refractory coating for sand mold. However, to \nthe best knowledge of the author [16] the cordierite ceramics has not been put into any foundry \napplication yet. Kaolinite based Cordierite was synthesized by Yamuna et al [17] and used as \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 7\n\nmaterials for exhaust converter core thus extending the potential applications of Cordierite to \nenvironmental protection. \n \n\nApart from thermo-mechanical engineering applications, cordierite also has high potential in \nelectronic packaging. Modern electronics industry requires smaller scale integrated circuit (IC) \ntherefore capacitor has to be smaller in distance. This will increase the capacitance dramatically \nand the charge collected at the capacitor will affect the operation of the IC. The industry has been \nlooking for replacement to SiO2 that currently being used as IC material with lower dielectric \nconstant and dissipation factor compensate the smaller distance. Cordierite is considered as one of \ncandidate materials due to its low dielectric constant, e.g. ?r=5 at 1 MHz and similar thermal \ncoefficient expansion of 3x10-6/K to single crystal silicon [18] plus stronger flexural strength (100 \nMPa) compared to SiO2 substrate. More recently, research on cordierite electronic application has \nbeen done and a very low dielectric constant (5.0-5.2) and dielectric loss (<0.008) [19, 20] were \nachieved from a batch sintered at 950 oC doped with 1.5 wt.%-3.0 wt.% ZnO [21, 22]. The \nthermal coefficient (3.6-4.8x10-6/K) matches well that of silicon which promises better electronic \npackaging than when SiO2 is used as substrate. The cordierite has low dielectric constant, which \nis also considered as an important requirement for mm-microwave dielectrics such as in [23] that \nNi-substituted respective to Mg, namely (Mg1?xNix)2Al4Si5O18 cordierite has microwave \nproperties such as relative lower dielectric constant (6-11), very high quality factor up to 99,110 \nGHz (Q x f) as well as nearly zero temperature coefficient of resonant frequency and so on. On \nthe other hand, one of successful candidates to replace traditional SiO2 material is developed by \nApplied Materials, \u201cBlack diamond\u201d which has been used in the IC industry. However, Cordierite \nhas not only low-? but also strong mechanical strength, thermal and chemical resistance and \nstability. Therefore the potential of cordierite in IC industry is still a hot topic nowadays.     \n \n\nThe synthesis of cordierite has been a challenge due to high temperature required and \nporosity removal during heat treatment. However cordierite sinterability was also found not good \ndue to narrow range of sintering temperature [24]. Tummala et al [25] reported that completed \ndensification is achieved for cordierite glass powder by melting a mixture of the raw ingredients \nof given composition (13 wt.% MgO, 27 wt.% Al2O3 and 60 wt.% SiO2) in alumina crucibles at \n1500 oC for 2 h until it was completely homogenized. The molten glass was water quenched to \nform \u2018\u2018cullets\u2019\u2019. The cullets have to be further ball milled with two steps to an average particle \nsize around 2 mm. The sintering agent P2O5, B2O3 (B2O3 and P2O5<5 wt.%) was employed to \nreduce sintering temperature between 900-950 oC. Similarly Nandi studied glass frit preparation \n[26]. Kumar et al [18] studied and claimed that improved sinterability can be obtained by two \napproaches either changing the glass compositions with excess MgO [27] and less Al2O3 or \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 8\n\nadding sintering aids such as P2O5 and B2O3. Chen [21] studied the addition of ZnO wt.% on \ncrystallization behaviour in cordierite sintering and properties. Chen found that with increasing \nZnO the batch melting temperature, glass transition temperature and crystallization temperature \nall decreases. Meanwhile, another method recently appeared to lower the sintering temperature is \nto based on sol-gel derived cordierite glass and the results showed the sintering temperature \ndecreased below 1000 oC [20]. The starting agent of synthesis of cordierite could be mixture of \nstoichiometric pure MAS oxides however most works were more interested in using non-standard \nmixture of natural clays such as kaolin, talc and corundum [28]. Although using mixture of \nnatural materials poses a problem of composition control however the saving of production cost \nfrom pure oxides is significant appealing factor that drives the research in understanding of \nbehaviour and sintering schedule. In summary, the cordierite could be synthesized by glass \ncrystallization method [11, 26, 29], sol-gel method, or solid-state reaction. However, the first two \nmethods are not suitable for industrial scale production due to involved high cost reagents or \nmore complicated synthesis procedures. Although the pure oxides with stoichiometric mixture \nyield high efficiency of production but the cost effectiveness drives the work of studying \ncompositional variation effect from natural materials [30]. \n \n1.3 Mullite  \n\n \nIn the MgO-SiO2-Al2O3 phase diagram (Fig. 1.1), pure oxides of MgO, SiO2 and Al2O3 could \n\ncrystallise into other MAS minerals with different stoichiometric compositions at different \ntemperatures. This is more perplexing in our investigation since the original cordierite precursor \npowder is made of natural materials with non-stoichiometric compositions. The composition of \nother minerals in the sintered sample has a significant influence on the thermal-mechanical \nproperties such as thermal expansion, electrical and shock resistance. One of the most dominant \nphases which co-exist with cordierite at high temperature is Mullite, Al6Si2O13 or 3Al2O3-2SiO2. \nThe unit cell of mullite is shown in Fig. 1.5. \n \n\n \nFig. 1.5: crystal structure of mullite\u2019s unit cell \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 9\n\n \nThe most noticeable use of mullite is related to its refractory properties with melting point at \n\n1840 oC. Mullite is also known as Aluminium silicate which is rare mineral on earth naturally \nformed and mostly from post-clay genesis. Mullite becomes dominating phase at high \ntemperature above 1500 oC in case of Mg deficiency since cordierite or other phase has melt. \nTherefore it is most seen in nature near to volcanic site where it was firstly discovered in 1924 in \nvolcanic rock in Scotland. \n \n\nMullite has two morphologies in platelet shape and needle shape. The needle shape mullite is \ndesirable to be formed in cordierite ceramics matrix during heat treatment since it has beneficiary \neffect on increasing the fracture strength and thermal shock resistance over long cycle and large \nload [31]. The most important condition to form needle shape reinforced ceramics lying with the \ncomposition of silica and alumina and temperature as well as the environment being either \nreductive or oxygenated. When the composition and sintering gas environment are adjusted to \ndesirable values needle mullite will form at 1200 oC [31] and the needles will interlock thus \nincreasing the fracture strength. This potential increase of mechanical fracture strength has \nimportant implication in reinforcing the brittle porcelain. The formation of needle (tubular) shape \nmullite depends on the presence of crystallization centres which are often impurities. Pitak et al \n[31] studied the high temperature performance of materials consisting of needle shape mullite and \nshowed it is an excellent structural material. The specimen consisting needle shape mullite from \nmolten kaolin softens under load of 0.2 MPa at 1750 oC while the creep under the same load after \n10 h hold is zero. However the sintered kaolin with 12% porosity shows softening at 1520 oC and \n15% creep at 1200 oC with the same load. \n \n1.4 Composite ceramics  \n\n \nAlthough there are many advantages (high modulus, hardness, chemical resistance, low \n\nthermal expansion and good refractoriness) of using ceramics as highly effectively structural \nmaterials, they also present some negative aspects. One of most noticeable disadvantages is the \nseverely underestimated strength of ceramics, which is between 1/10 and 1/100 of the theoretical \nvalue predicted from interatomic bonding strength. This phenomenon has been explained in A. A. \nGriffith\u2019s theoretical fracture strength equation considering the existence of flaws, and the \nbrittleness was explained as consequence of increased stress concentration in vicinity of \nmicro-cracks or pores [32] given by: \n\n1/ 2\n2 S\n\nc\nE\n\na\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n? ?= ? ?\n? ?\n\n (1.1) \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 10\n\nWhere E is the elastic modulus of fully dense material; ?S is the specific surface energy; and \na is half length of internal crack. From this equation one can see that bigger the internal crack is, \neasier the ceramics will break. Equation (1.1) also implies that the fracture strength for ceramics \nmaterials is not likely the same due to statistical distribution of the micro-crack length. Apart \nfrom this, ceramics also presents image of being weak in shear and tension, brittle with KIc in \nregion 1-12 MPa m1/2 compared to Al alloys have KIc =25-50 MPa m1/2. The brittleness of \nceramics is due to the ionic bond that has much less flexibility to deform plastically compared to \nnon-brittle materials e.g. metals. When the bond is broken the structure will completely fail. It is \nunlikely to change the interatomic bond nature however it is possible to add second phase to \nmodify the ceramics materials. Therefore the development was focused on combining the \nadvantages while reducing the drawbacks by reinforcing the ceramics with less hard but more \nplastic materials in order to relieve the stress concentrated around crack to maintain the structure \nin avoiding catastrophic failure.  \n \n\nComposite materials have attracted strong interests due to the nature that composite could \ncombine two materials advantages and reduce or minimise the disadvantages from each phases. \nAn example of composite is designed by using nanoparticles e.g., carbon nanotubes (~10-9 m) as \nreinforcing phase to modify and improve the physical or mechanical properties of matrices for \ninstance polymer without sacrificing its lightweight property. The fact that addition of only small \namount of CNTs induces an significant improvement on macro-scale properties has made \nnanocomposites highly attractive new classes of lightweight, high strength and multifunctional \nmaterials [33]. Polymer nanocomposites have achieved such success being reinforced with a wide \nvariety of different nanoparticles and CNTs. \n\n \nHowever, the idea of dispersing high modulus/strength CNT in cordierite or other ceramics \n\nfaces difficulties in processing due to the fact that the CNT will likely decompose and react with \noxygen-containing ceramics above 600 oC. In addition to this, CNTs are hydrophobic without \nsurface chemistry modification in polar liquid such as water and most polymer resins. These \ncause a poor dispersion of CNTs in aqueous ceramics slurry which results in much lower \nmechanical properties enhancement than expected. Therefore, the carbon oxidation during \nsintering and adverse effect of poor dispersion hinders the development to obtain high mechanical \nproperties of CNT reinforced ceramics composites. Despite this, CNT has been found \nsuccessfully applied in pure metal, Aluminium [34, 35] and [36]; more recently, in \nnon-oxygenated ceramics system for fracture toughening such as ZrB2-SiC [37], Si3N4 [38]; Cho \net al [39] reviewed the progress the CNT-loaded ceramic composite.; It is noteworthy that Estili \net al [40, 41] claimed that reinforcement of oxygen containing ceramics ?-alumina with CNT has \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 11\n\nbeen successful by Spark plasma sintering (SPS). The SPS method enabled to avoid the problem \nof CNT oxidation [42]: The sintering was carried out at 1350 oC and the heating rate is 100 \noC/min; The holding time at 1350 oC was 12 min; and the SPS was also in hot isostatic pressing \ncondition with applied pressure of 75 MPa. The vacuum is 1.8 Pa or 1.8\u00d710-5 bar. The sintering \nDie and punches are made of graphite resulting in a reductive atmosphere during sintering. The \nsample relative density was 100%. Very recently, an very interesting result has been reported by \nWang et al [43] regarding the reinforcement of mullite ceramics matrix with CNT by hot pressing \nsintering. This is considered a breakthrough in terms of oxygen-containing ceramics \nreinforcement with CNT loading. The result in [43] showed the sample was sintered at 1600 oC \nwith 5 vol.% of MWNT leading to 10% increase in bending strength and 78% increase in fracture \ntoughness. The preparation was performed using hot pressing in Ar atmosphere at 30 MPa in \ngraphite die at 1500, 1550, 1600 and 1650 oC for 1 h and the aim was to compare the mechanical \nproperties of pure mullite prepared under the same conditions. Despite, the result in term of \nmechanical properties improvement is sceptical due to large error. However SEM images shows \nthat CNT is not degraded in mullite matrix under Ar gas protection above 1500 oC. Despite the \nsuccess claimed by the author, the mechanical properties were seen decreased at 1650 oC with the \nsame CNT loading, which was not be able to explain well. Anyhow provided a hint to continue \nCNT-loaded cordierite composite research via conventional heat treatment route instead of SPS \nroute in Estili et al work [40, 42].  \n \n\nTo the best knowledge of the author, there is no report related to CNT-loaded composite \nceramics with cordierite as primary phase. A wide-ranging ceramics-ceramics composites for \ncordierite were developed with modifying phases such as AlN [44, 45] (show optimum content of \nAlN for best mechanical performance with low-k and thermal stability). Studies on mechanical, \nelectrical and thermal properties of cordierite composite have also appeared with other ceramics \nreinforcing or modifying phases such as Mullite [46-53], Zirconia [54-56], alumina [57] or \nalumina fibre [58], Mica [59], glass [60, 61], glass-fibre [62], forsterite (spinel) [63] as well as \nsilicon carbide [64, 65] and SiC whisker [66] or SiC platelets, particles [67]. SiC was found very \neffective to reinforce the cordierite\u2019s fracture toughness from less than 2 MPa1/2 to 3.5 MPa1/2 \nwith 30 vol% SiC whisker while the fracture strength was found the most effectively reinforced \nby adding SiC particles instead of whiskers from 170 MPa to 270 MPa while the SiC whisker \naddition at 30 vol% reinforced the fracture strength only up to 230 MPa [67]. Meanwhile SiC is \nalso studied by Liu and Zhu et al [65, 68] to produce porous foam however the SiC foam requires \nhigh sintering temperature above 2100 oC which limits its application. Various ceramics are \nconsidered as bonding agents to fabricate the SiC foam among which Cordierite is considered one \nof the best candidates to sinter SiC foam at lower temperature. \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 12\n\n \nCordierite-mullite composite is often found in the literature used for refractory application. \n\nThe mullite has different morphology and the shape of mullite grain appeared to be very \ninfluential to the cordierite-mullite composite [53]. Ibrahim showed [69] that excessive corundum \nis added in order to produce the required mechanical properties. The thermal shock resistance of \ncordierite composite according to ASTM standard by water quench test to ceramics body heated \nat 950 oC for 15 min and repeat this until the ceramics body fails. The sample showed excellent \nthermal shock resistance until 36 cycles [70]. Ozel et al [51] studied the processing of \ncordierite-mullite composite by tape casting or mixed with pre-produced mullite powder into \ncordierite starting powders. Their results showed that the mixing of mullite powder produced \nstronger strength of composite in the cordierite slip casting process due to better densification. \nThe cordierite-mullite has also presented interesting electrical properties. The electrical properties \nas function of volume fraction of mullite in cordierite matrix has also been studied and of being \nsubject to research [49]. The cordierite and mullite vol.% dependent electrical properties as well \nas dielectric properties versus porosity were examined systematically [49]. The author claimed \nthat the composite with 70 wt.% cordierite fine powder and 30 wt.% medium particles exhibit the \nbest electrical properties (dielectric constant ~7, dielectric loss=0.01-0.125). In the meantime, this \ncomposition shows excellent match TEC that of silicon as substrate material. Although addition \nof mullite does increase the dielectric constant from around 6 to 7 but the dielectric loss is \ndecreased by 100%. The overall properties of cordierite-mullite composite are more favourable \nthan that of neat cordierite.   \n\n \nAs previously discussed, cordierite has been widely used in refractory materials such as kiln \n\nfurniture, furnace support and some high temperature gas burner for instance, as well as advanced \nceramics components for aerospace and so on. The most important properties of cordierite or \ncordierite-based ceramics composite lie with its excellent linear thermal expansion and thermal \nshock resistance. Thermal shock resistance (TSR) is widely studied among MAS ceramics such \nas Bauxite and Dolomite [71], cordierite/SiC composite [70, 72], mullite-cordierite composite, \nalumina\u2013mullite\u2013zirconia and alumina\u2013mullite by slip casting [73] using water quench method. \nYamuna et al [74] also tried IR heating to study thermal shock resistance in cordierite porous \nceramics which showed advantages over water quench method. Recently, Tomba et al [75] \nemployed the thermal shock induced stress in the cordierite ceramics disk and studied the effect \nof TSR by Finite element Analysis (FEM). In addition to this, the cordierite has been made to \nfunctional component such as honeycomb used as catalyst converter and the thermal shock \nresistance is studied and modeled based on the bulk materials by FEM, in which he found that the \nmaximum thermal stress is less than the flexural strength of the material. The experiment supports \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 13\n\nthe FEM results that the honeycomb structure does not fail after flame heating up to the melting \npoint [76].  \n \n\nIn one word, cordierite-based ceramics is a very hot topic due to its unique properties. The \nmost critical issue of cordierite-mullite-alumina composite research as mentioned in most \nliteratures is the controlled formation of mineral phase with parameters such as sintering \ntemperature, time, and starting materials. Banjuraizah et al [11] and Wu et al [77] showed that \nMgO excess distribution highly affects the cordierite formation efficiency and has effect on \nmicrostructural, thermal, mechanical and electrical properties of the ceramics sintered from \nnon-stoichiometric/non-Standard precursor materials. However, the complete picture of roles of \nadditives and binders in synthesis versus physical, thermal and mechanical properties is still an \nunaccomplished task. Thus, a good understanding, high efficiency sintering schedule from natural \nmaterials in terms of various properties is needed. In the following investigation, \ncordierite-mullite composite with other phases is synthesized and studied based on original \npowder of non-stoichiometric composition from commercial supplier. A more comprehensive \nwork is beyond the scope of the present. However, the above-mentioned issues are expected to be \naddressed in near future. \n \n1.5 Cordierite foam \n\n \nCeramics foams are cellular structure with struts made of bulk or bulk ceramics. It is found to \n\nbe applied for instance in construction industry for thermal isolation, or as porous scaffolds for \nbone replacement made of bioactive ceramics. Ceramics foam is an important class of materials \nproviding modest mechanical strength, shaping ability, hardness, durability, chemical inactivity, \nbio-compatibility. Apart from these, ceramics foam inherits the excellent thermal properties and \nare thought to be the most likely choice for filter and catalyst support with research interests [78]. \nOne of the principal applications of ceramic foams in thermal engineering is lying with filter for \nhigh temperature fluid media due to its thermal stability (bulk TEC as low as 10-6/K, Table 1.1), \nlow thermal conductivity, low density and excellent thermal shock resistance. One of the \nnoteworthy example is Zirconia foam has achieved thermal insulation properties equivalent to \nthat of NASA space shuttle thermal protective tile but with much lower specific weight at 550 oC \n[79].  \n\n \nThe foundry industry also has special interest in using ceramic foam in order to improve \n\nquality and productivity of metal casting which suffered from non-metallic impurity. The molten \nmetal has typical temperature of 1000 oC and therefore the ceramic foam is required with \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 14\n\nexcellent mechanical-thermal properties [80]. The chemical stability is foreseen because molten \nmetal contains very reactive species such as aluminium, titanium, hafnium and carbon. The \nthermal shock resistance is parameter to the component not to crack due to thermal expansion \ninduced stress. Montanaro et al [79] has claimed that the thermal shock resistance is largely \ndependent on the foam cell size (increasing with increase of cell size) but weakly dependent on \nthe density (also increasing with increase of density). However, the last but not the least t \nrequirement to ensure good functional property is permittivity of the foam in terms of the cavity \nfraction and homogeneity of the foam which control the flow rate of the molten metal.  \n\n \nThe structures of ceramics foam can be summarized in two types: 1) closed cell ceramics and \n\n2) open-cell ceramics. The closed cell can be normally achieved by blowing air into molten \nmaterials or introducing foaming agent in the ceramics slurry. The closed cellular structure is \nformed and followed by calcinations at suitable temperature [2]. However closed cell ceramics \nfoam can be used as thermal insulating or acoustic damping applications but hardly used as \nmaterial for filtering or catalyst support which requires permittivity through the foam.  \n\n \nThe ceramics fabrication is a difficult task due to the high temperatures required to sinter the \n\ngreen body into densified product. This is particularly troubling in case of ceramic foams since \nnormal chemically induced foaming procedure will be burn out before the ceramics green body is \nsintered. Mutanaro et al [79] summarised the most conventional ceramics foam production \napproach in which two primary processing routes are applied. There are routes to fabricate \nCeramics foams such as bubbles generation into a slurry or at green state with special thermal \ntreatment, reaction sintering, control of sintering conditions in order to only achieve a partial \ndensification, stacking of presintered granules or fibres, aerogel and sol-gel methods, pyrolysis of \nvarious organic additives and the method used in most studies also in this investigation, \npolymeric sponge/replicating method due to its simplification and low cost of chemical agents use \n[79, 81].  \n\n \nOpen cell ceramic foams can made either by polymerizing (foaming) organic monomer in a \n\nceramic slurry then dried and calcined [2]. However, the most used methods in producing ceramic \nfoams is to coat the struts of a polymer preform with a ceramic slurry followed by drying and \nslowly (1 oC/min) burning out the polymer struts at intermediate temperature. Neto et al [81] \nstudied the impregnation of cordierite foam using Polyurethane foam as replica and burned out \npolyurethane at 550 oC for 30 min followed by sintering at 1350 oC for 1 h. In this regard, \npolyurethane foam is most popular due to its non-toxic nature and versatility of microstructure \ncontrol versus water content as foaming agent. The ceramics slurry usually contains particles \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 15\n\nfrom 0.1~10 um with a suitable dispersant, and a binder/thickening agent to increase the bonding \nof the slurry on the surface of polymer strut [2]. The polymeric replica method has two variations, \nwithout, and with a thickening agent added to the slurry, the excess of which is then removed by \nblowing air or by squeezing after impregnation, thus obtaining a ceramic replica of the polymeric \nfoam. The foams prepared former variation exhibit good air or fluid permittivity but lower \nmechanical strength, whilst the latter variation enables higher strength to be obtained due to high \nfraction of solid but decreases fluid permittivity.  \n \n\nAn example of open cell with high porosity is shown in Fig. 1.6 illustrating the struts, cell \nand windows in a positive image of original polymer struts. The ceramic foams can be made with \na wide range of properties and processing conditions via controlling the impregnation behaviour \nand rheological properties of the slurry. One of the most effective ways to control the \nmicrostructure and porosity is by squeezing the excessive slurries in different ratio to the original \npolymer struts. \n\n \nHowever, the application of Ceramics foam is still limited because of their much lower \n\nmechanical strength in terms of Young\u2019s modulus and compression strength, thermal and \ndimensional stability compared to theoretical predictions with analytical model due to defect and \nporosity within the struts as demonstrated in Fig.1.6. The influence of experimental parameters on \nthe mechanical properties will be revisited later in this thesis. \n\n \nFig. 1.6: typical open cell structure of Al2O3 with windows, strut and cell [2] \n\n \nThe structure illustrated in Fig. 1.6. shows many small pores distributed on the surface of the \n\nstruts due to burning-out of polymer and shrinkage during sintering. Some researchers aimed at \nstudying the preparation of ceramic suspensions with suitable rheological properties in order to \nimprove the processing conditions of cordierite foams by the polymeric sponge method, avoid \ndefects in the struts after sintering and enhance the mechanical properties with second \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 16\n\nimpregnation of slurry to fill the pores or defects [82]. \n \n\nThe goal of the present work is to optimize the processing steps routes in order to obtain high \nspecific modulus, high specific strength of cordierite foams for thermo-mechanical applications. \nThe primary interest is to observe how the amount (wt.%) of dispersant and solid loading (vol.%) \naffect the rheological properties of the suspensions and the ability of polymeric foams. Susana et \nal [83] showed that precursor cordierite suspensions containing 45 vol.% solids dispersed with 0.8 \nwt.% Targon 1128 enabled good impregnating conditions. However this work did not considered \nthe effects of either adding a thickening agent or of the slurry to struts weight ratio to control the \nmicrostructure homogeneity. A comprehensive study of rheological properties dependent effect \non impregnation is beyond the timescale of this project at current stage, and the optimized \nparameters were selected from [83]. In this investigation, under the optimized rheological \nproperties conditions of the slurry, the weight ratio of impregnating slurry to neat polymer struts \nis considered a critical parameter to control the structure of the foams obtained. The effects of \ndrying conditions on the microstructure homogeneity of the foams were also studied using optical \ninspection. Microstructural characterization of as-produced ceramics foams was also performed \nby SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) and X-ray micro-tomography. Mechanical \ncharacterization tests included measurement of foam\u2019s apparent Young\u2019s modulus, Compression \nstrength and Poisson ratio. Finally, modelling of mechanical properties is performed for cellular \nmaterials to simulate the mechanical behaviour of the experiment.  \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 17\n\nChapter 2: Experimental techniques \n \n2.1 Particle Size Analyzer \n\n \nCoulter LS230 Laser spectrometer was used to determine the particle size distribution of the \n\nprecursor powder dispersed in dilute aqueous suspension using the Fraunhofer optical model. The \nprinciple employed Coulter LS laser 230 lying with forward light scattering and Polarization \nintensity differential scattering (PIDS). This is discussed and compared to other particle size \nmeasurement principles by Taib et al [84]. The forward light scattering instrument consists of \nthree main components: sensor, sample cell and particle counter. The particle is detected by \nscattered laser light whenever the particle is in the sample cell. The intensity alterations of laser \nlight are collected by the detector. The particle size is proportional to the amplitude of the light \nintensity while the number of light pulses is used to determine the number fraction of the particles. \nThe suspension is used with filtered tap water. The use of tap water is limited unless filtered due \nto bubble generation from degassing when the water temperature increases. According to [84] the \nbubble size could range between 100 to 500 \u00b5m and elimination by background measurement is \nnot possible [85]. \n \n2.2 Scanning Electron Microscopy \n\n \nScanning Electron Microscope (SEM) is a type of electron microscopy technique that images \n\nthe sample surface by scanning it with a high-energy beam of electrons. The electrons interact \nwith the atoms that make up the sample producing signals that contain information about the \nsample's surface topography, composition and other properties such as electrical conductivity. \nThe SEM is carried out on Hitachi SU-70 microscope installed at University of Aveiro. \n\nThe microscope is equipped with EDX (Energy Dispersion X-ray) module and PC terminal in \norder to analyse the elemental compositions and digitalise the image in real time. The types of \nsignals produced by SEM including secondary electrons (SEs); back scattered electrons (BSEs), \ncharacteristic X-rays, light (cathodoluminescence), specimen current and transmitted electrons. \nThese signals require specialized detectors that are not usually all present on a single machine. \nThe signals result from interactions of the electron beam with atoms at or near the surface of the \nsample. In standard detection mode, secondary electron imaging or SEI is commonly used. The \nSEM can produce very high-resolution images of a sample surface, revealing details about 1 to 5 \nnm in dimension. Due to the way these images are created, SEM micrographs have a very large \ndepth of field yielding a characteristic three-dimensional appearance useful for understanding the \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 18\n\nsurface structure of a sample. A wide range of magnifications is possible, from about 25 x (about \nequivalent to that of a powerful hand-lens) to about 250000x, about 250 times the magnification \nlimit of the best light microscopes.  \n\n2.3 X-ray Powder diffraction \n \nX-ray powder diffraction is used in this work as most important characterization to \n\ndetermined not only the phase identification during heat treatment but also quantitative phase \nfraction evaluation by whole pattern refinement analysis, also known as Rietveld refinement. \nX-way has been used in materials science with long history. It was discovered by physicist \nWolfgang C. Roentgen in early twenties centruies, when Roentgen was working with a cathode \nray tube similar to a fluorescent light bulb nowadays. He realized that he had discovered a \npreviously unknown \"invisible light,\" or radiation in a better sense, which was being emitted from \nthe tube. He named the new ray X-ray, because in mathematics \"X\" is used to indicated the \nunknown property. \n\n   \nX-ray is a kind of electromagnetic wave and its wavelength could range from very hard \n\nregion of 0.1 \u00c5 up to very soft 100 \u00c5 and this corresponds in terms of energy to the range of \n100-0.1 keV. The energy of X-ray is described by its wavelength: \n\n       \n12.4\n\nE\n?\n\n=  (keV)           (? in \u00c5)    (2.1) \n\nThe X-ray diffraction occurs based on the fact that X-ray will scatter at the periodical regular \natomic lattice spacing. A real three-dimensional crystal is extremely large compared to the \nwavelength of incident X-ray and contains many sets of atomic planes. For diffraction, crystal \nmust have the correct orientation with respect to the incoming beam, i.e. Bragg diffraction \ncondition 2dsin?=?, d is interplanar spacing, is the wavelength and ? determine the respective \norientation between the crystal and incoming beam. Perfectly, infinite large crystal and perfectly \ncollimated beam will allow the diffraction condition to be \u201cexactly\u201d satisfied. However, in reality, \nStrains, defects, and finite crystal size effects, as well as instrumental resolution due to \ncollimation cause diffraction peaks to be broadened. In case of losing periodic arrangement of \natoms in materials the diffraction pattern will show much more broadened feature which is \ncharacteristics to glass or liquid material. The diffraction patterns for perfect, imperfect and \nliquid/glass sample are seen in Fig. 2.1. For perfect crystals, I(q), (I is the diffracted intensity and \nq is scattering vector) consist of ? functions (perfectly sharp scattering). For imperfect crystals, \nthe peaks are broadened due to the factors of strains, crystallite size and instrument resolutions. \nFor liquids and glasses, the diffraction intensity is a continuous, slowly varying function. \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 19\n\n \n\n \nFig. 2.1 diffraction pattern between perfect, real crystal and amorphous material (liquid or glass) \n \n\nIn actual study of ceramics material, one often find that the XRD patterns show \nsuperimposed feature of imperfect crystal pattern on the top of the amorphous pattern. This \nimplies that the glass/liquid phase is formed and most of time unavoidable after sintering. This is \ndue to the non-stoichiometric conditions that precursor oxides cannot fully react to form \ncrystalline phase but transform into glassy phase. However quantification of the liquid/glass \nphase requires special sample preparation and data analysis skills which are not covered in this \nwork. \n  \n\nX-ray diffraction has been also used for quantitative crystal structure study since introduction \nof Rietveld refinement in 1960\u2019s by H.M. Rietveld [86, 87]. Rietveld [87] showed that the profile \nrefinement procedures by comparing to experiment was superior to any other methods involving \neither peak separation or use of total integrated intensity of groups of overlapping peaks. With \nRietveld method, one of most preeminent drawback of powder diffraction method, i.e. loss of \ninformation as result of overlapped peaks has been tackled effectively. The original Rietveld \nmethod was designed to analyze the pattern from low resolution neutron powder diffraction. \nHowever the method has been extended to high resolution X-ray diffractometer with proper \nprofile functions developed. The most important aspects of Rietveld method is the fitting could \ntake into account parameters relating to the instrument or structure such as half width broadening \nwithout any sample's effect, 2? zero offset, cell lattice parameters, temperature factors, atomic \nfractional coordinates, occupation numbers and so on in one analysis which speed up the \nefficiency of material analysis in a revolutionary way.  \n \n The Rietveld found its application particularly in quantitative phase (fraction) analysis (QPA) \nof mixed materials. There are primary two approaches in QPA called \u201ctraditional method\u201d and \n\u201cRietveld method\u201d. Both methods are based on calculation of the peak reflection intensity. The \nreflection intensity from (hkl) of phase j is written as below: \n\n2\n\n, ,2\njhkl\n\nj hkl hkl j hkl j j\nj\n\nf\nI I L F P A\n\nV\n=   (2.2) \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 20\n\nWhere, I: incident beam intensity, fj: phase volume fraction, Vj: cell volume, Lhkl,j: Lorentzian \npolarization, Fhkl,j: structure factor, Phkl,j: Texture factor, Aj: absorption factor. From (2.2) we see \nthat the intensity of diffraction peak is directly proportional to the phase volume fraction, hence \nthe weight fraction can be calculated provided each phase is known with its theoretical density \ncan be calculated by X-ray diffraction analysis. The parameters in (2.2) are not necessarily known \nbefore QPA.  \n \n\nThe traditional method to do quantitative phase analysis is based on internal reference by \nadding a known amount of additional phase to mixture and measure the peak intensity ratio. \nTherefore the amount of other phase can be calculated based on the ratio between their respective \npeak intensity to that of the known amount of internal reference as shown in (2.3).  \n\n' ' '\nint int\n\nhkl\nj j\n\nh k l\nernal enral\n\nI wt\nK\n\nI wt\n=    (2.3) \n\nHowever traditional method presents several unavoidable limits [88] such as the \nmethodology to determine the peak intensity is often done to the height instead of peak integral; \nOnly one or few peaks are used and this will produce error when preferred orientation is present; \nIn case of peak overlapping the peak integral is difficult to be extracted as intensity. This \nprincipal error source urges the scientist to adopt alternative approach of QPA, namely Rietveld \nrefinement. \n \n\nIn the Rietveld method, the peak is fitted with mathematical profile functions, thus differing \nfrom the internal reference method. Rietveld method uses a structure dependent approach \nincluding all crystal structure and sample microstructure information. However, Rietveld method \nalso has limitations. When the structural information is not complete even for just one phase, the \nrefinement work cannot proceed. The incorrect structural information will also affect the \nquantitative phase analysis in a significant way since the profile intensity is solely determined the \ncrystal structural information.

Where Sn are now the scale factor for the phase j and comparing this to \nintensity formula for the hkl reflection in (2.2), the volume fraction or weight fraction of phase j \ncan be written as: \n\n1\n\nj\nj N\n\ni\nn\n\nS\nf\n\nS\n=\n\n=\n\n?\n and \n\n1\n\nj j\nj N\n\ni i\ni\n\nS\nwt\n\nS\n\n?\n\n?\n=\n\n=\n\n?\n  (2.5) \n\nN is the total number of phases in mixture, Sj is scale factor, ?i is density of phase, Si?i is \nphase density of the phase. In (2.4) t the intensity of profile is calculated from the crystal structure \nand compared to the experimental data. The difference between them are minimized by adjusting \nthe parameters such as crystal structure, sample size and instrument broadening as well as \nbackground and phase fraction. Therefore a quality of fit must be evaluated to the difference \nbetween the calculated and experiment, called \u201cresidual factor\u201d. The typical residual factor of \nRietveld refinements are profile residual factor Rp, weighted residual factor \u201cRwp\u201d and expected \nresidual factor \u201cRexp\u201d given by: \n\n( ) ( )\n\n( )\n\ni i\ni\n\np\ni\n\ni\n\ny obs y calc\nR\n\ny obs\n\n?\n=\n\n?\n?\n\n     (2.6), ( )\n( )\n\n1/ 22\n\n2\n\n( ) ( )\n\n( )\ni i i\n\nwp\ni i\n\nw Y obs Y calc\nR\n\nw Y obs\n\n? ??? ?\n= ? ?\n\n? ?? ?\n\n?\n?\n\n (2.7) \n\n[ ]2exp ( ) ( )i i\ni\n\nR N P w y obs? ?= ?? ?? ?\n?

N in (2.8) is total \nnumber of data points and P is total number of parameters taken into account in the refinement. \nAnd the ratio between Rwp and Rexp is called ?2 \n\n2\nexpwpR R? =  (2.9) \n\n?2 is the goodness of the fit. Ideally it should be 1 however a practical guide is ?2 usually \nrequired be less than 2 for simple and well crystalline phase. The ?2 is often larger than 2 due to \ninsufficient information of the model or poor quality of the data due to limited X-ray \nmeasurement time. Nevertheless, these days the Rietveld refinement is more and more popular \nused in challenging field such as dealing with complex mixture of phases (8-10) or \nsemi-crystalline and amorphous phase. Therefore it is very often to see that Rp larger than 15 and \n?2 is larger than 2 which we still accept as a good refinement. The last but not the least is that the \nRietveld refinement is also an extremely user experience related approach and the result could be \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 22\n\ndifferent or very different from one to another user for the same dataset. Someone even argued \n[89] that one or two years experience is needed in order to be able successfully use the Rietveld \nmethod independently. \n\n \nThe success to carry out a good QPA appears to be also dependent on choice of refinement \n\nstrategy and software claimed by Connor et al [90]. Therefore we conducted a software \nbenchmark to determine the most successful QPA strategy in our case. Currently several software \nare available either from commercial or free-of-charge sources. TOPAS is developed by Alan \nCoelho and commercialized by Bruker AXS. The other commercial one is used for trial in this \ninvestigation is \u201cSiroquant\u201d developed by Sietronics Australia. The advantage of using Siroquant \nis that the refinement benefit from using built-in mineral database containing structure of around \n1800 most common minerals and compounds. However commercialization limits the usefulness \nof the software to us. In addition to this, free software such GSAS [91] developed by Los Alamos \nNational Laboratory (USA), and MAUD [92] by University of Trento (Italy) are compared. The \nbenchmark study is conducted for mixture of 3 oxides (V2O5, SnO2 and ZnO) of good \ncrystallinity with well-known structure. The weight fraction was pre-determined for comparison \nto those obtained from Rietveld method. In order to remove any ambiguities in choosing Rietveld \nProgram due to data quality, the collection of data is perform over long time for very good \nintensity statistics. The typical recommended time Rietveld refinement is 2-5 h depending on the \nsample\u2019s phase complexity. Nevertheless we run the sample for 12 h. The result of QPA using \nGSAS and MAUD was shown in Table 2.1.   \n\n \nTable 2.1: QPA results from Rietveld Refinement \n\nphases weight(g) wt.% GSAS wt.% MAUD wt.%  \nZnO 3.292 25.528 29 29.75 \nSnO2 8.1958 63.556 48 61.29 \nV2O5 1.4076 10.915 22 8.96 \n\n \nThe result in Table 2.1 suggested MAUD gives a significant better agreement to experiment \n\nwhile GSAS showed the unsatisfactory agreement for SnO2 and V2O5. Despite that both programs \nuse the same algorithm shown in equation (2.5), the programs give different report on QPA is \nrather surprising.  \n\n \nThe Rietveld refinement by GSAS is shown in Fig. 2.2 and by MAUD in Fig. 2.3 \n\nrespectively. It was somehow surprising that the refinement by GSAS showed excellent quality of \nfitting in terms of difference curve and residual factor (see Fig. 2.2). However the QPA result in \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 23\n\nTable 2.1 does not reflect a good agreement to experiment. This alerts us that a choice of program \nand strategy should be considered unless the cause of disagreement could be identified and \ntackled. \n \n\n \nFig. 2.2: refinement plot of ZnO-SnO2-V2O5(GSAS): Rwp=8.33%, Rp=6.25%  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 2.3: QPA result of 12 h scan by Rietveld method (MAUD), Rwp ~17% \n\n \nOn the other hand, MAUD showed relatively worse quality of Rietveld fit, Rw~17% in Fig. \n\n2.3. However, the QPA result is very close to experimental result. The deterioration of quality is \nsupposed to relate to the incorrect model of background subtraction. However, a comparative \nstudy between GSAS, MAUD for mixture of ZnO, SnO2 and V2O5 suggested that the MAUD \nshould be used in QPA practice.  \n \n\nFinally, being a powerful investigation tool, X-ray diffraction also has disadvantage due to \ndecreasing scattering power as function of diffraction 2?. This gives problem in determination of \nsmall structural details within the higher angle (small d-spacing) peak region.   \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 24\n\n \n2.4 Mechanical properties Characterization \n\n \nMechanical properties are the most important to ceramics materials at ambient or \n\nnon-ambient environment. The typical measurements include characterization of compressive and \nflexural properties. However, for ceramics samples, another measurement technique based on \nsonic vibration is also introduced due to difficulty in performing compression test to obtain \nYoung\u2019s modulus. All measurements were conduced at room temperature in the study. However, \nthe high temperature behaviour of ceramics modulus is an interesting subject to be determined \nwith special setup in sonic vibration technique for advanced refractory application such as \naerospace and rocket industry. \n\n \n2.4.1 Compression  \n\nYoung\u2019s modulus and Compression strength study were carried out for the cellular structure \nof ceramics by compression test. The specimen preparation does not follow dimension \nrequirement of ASTM standard due to sample machinability hardship caused by ceramics \nbrittleness. However, the equation (2.10) was used to calculate the modulus from ASTM \nstandard.  \n\nWH\nE\n\nAD\n=     (2.10)  \n\nWhere W is the load (N), and H is the initial height in m of the sample, A is the initial area \n(in m2) of the sample and D is the intercept distance (in m) between point T and O on deformation \naxis as shown in Fig. 2.4. The point S is chosen arbitrarily [93]. The stress-deformation curves \nusually required to be measured 6 times prepared from the same batch [93]. However, this could \nnot be easily achieved since the production ceramic foams with homogeneous microstructure are \na difficult and time-consuming (2 weeks) process. Alternative strategy must be adopted such as \none or two samples from the same batch are used to measure the Compression strength. The \nCompression strength is determined by finding the first maximum load divided by the cross \nsectional area of the cube in each measurement and mean value and standard deviation are \ncalculated.  \n \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 25\n\n \n\nFig. 2.4: Schematic illustration of calculating elastic modulus [93] \n\n \nIn general, a typical compressive behaviour of stress-strain curve of polymer foam with \n\nnon-brittle struts material (unlike ceramics) is presented in Fig. 2.5; it shows that there are three \nstages in compression mode mechanical behaviour. \n\ni. Linear elastic region, where stress is linearly proportional to strain; \nii. Plateau region, characterized by a maximum compressive stress at start and \n\nstress-independent deformation with increasing strain; this corresponds to a hardening effect;  \niii. Densification region, final stage where the material is pressed and densified, hence \n\nexhibiting bulk behaviour. \n \n\n      \nFig. 2.5: Compression stress-strain curve of \n\npolymer foam [94]                  \nFig.2.6: Compression stress-strain curve of \n\nceramics foam [95] \n \n\nFrom the slope of linear elastic region, the Young\u2019s modulus can be calculated and the \nintersection point between elastic region and plateau region gives the maximum compressive \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 26\n\nstrength. Polymer Foams have a high energy absorption capacity represented by the area below \nthe curve in Fig. 2.5. This type of behaviour is complicated in case of ceramic foams as seen in \nFig. 2.6; samples are numbered from 3-7 with different microstructures. Since the strut is made of \nmaterials with brittle nature and they cannot undergo large deformation. For instance, the high \nlevel of brittleness of ceramics struts of ceramic foam causes ceramics struts failure and breaks. \nTherefore, the stress-strain curve shows a zigzag behaviour until the cellular structure breaks \ndown completely due to major event of crack propagation and hence stress drop to minimal as \nseen in Fig. 2.6. The Compression strength is defined at start of plateau of stress. However, the \nYoung\u2019s modulus from compression test is dubious and often found to be significantly lower (by \n2 or 3 orders of magnitude) than values given by sonic vibration measurements.  \n \n2.4.2 Flexural strength \n  \n\nFlexural strength is also known as bending strength or fracture strength which measures the \ntrend or capability how much strength materials can resist on bending until fracture. It is a very \nimportant engineering property in structural and component design. The unit used for flexural \nstrength is MPa in case of the force is in N and the area is in mm2. The most typical measurement \nmethod for flexural strength is based on \u201cthree points\u201d bending which is illustrated in Fig. 2.7. \n \n\n \nFig. 2.7: illustration of three-point bending test of flexural strength [96] \n\nThe determination of flexural strength is carried out in two cases for sample with rectangular or \ncircular cross section. For a rectangular bar, the calculation of the flexural strength is given by: \n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n (for a circular cross section)\n\n2\n\n  (for a circular cross section)\n\nf\n\nf\n\nFL\nbd\nPL\nR\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n=\n\n=\n (2.11) \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 27\n\nWhere, F is the load (N) at the mid-point of the sample, and L=Lss as seen in Fig. 2.7 is the length \nof the lower support span, b is width and d is thickness of the sample in mm; in case of circular \ncross section, R is the radius. The measurement method could also refer to procedures given by \nATSM standard [97]. R1, R2 in Fig. 2.7 is not relevant in our investigation since the contact \nregion between the sample and stressed point is not spherical but parallel surface. \n\nThe flexural strength represents the maximum stress experienced in the material at its \nmoment of rupture. In practical application, the flexural strength is often equivalized to the Von \nMises stress [98] in modeling. This is especially useful in cellular structure since the structure of \ncellular framework is random and the stress generated due to strain is not uniform. Somewhere in \nthe cellular structure the stress exceeds the flexural strength earlier than other part. This implies \nthat part will fracture earlier and the crack generated is likely to propagate to cause global \nmechanical failure. We will see the comparison between the experiment and modeling of the \nfracture of ceramics cellular structure in this work later on. \n\n2.4.3 Impulse Excitation Measurement \n The impulse excitation technique is based on the principle that solid will vibrate under \nexternal stimuli at its intrinsic frequency and the air around the solid will be excited at the same \nfrequency and hence the sound wave is generated. The generated sound signal will be measured \nby the acoustic transducer and converted into electrical signal of waveform. The waveform is then \nanalyzed by Fourier transform (FT) to obtain the frequency components of the waveform. The \nfundamental frequency of the waveform corresponds to the fundamental frequency of the solid \nharmonic mode.  \n \n The fundamental frequency of impulse excitation is connected to the solid materials \nproperties such as Young\u2019s modulus (E) and shear modulus (G). This technique is often used in \nfield of non-destructive test or non-ambient environment where conventional compression test is \nnot possible. In case of ceramics or porous materials, this technique is advantageous since the \nceramics often exhibit a very high modulus and the required force to compress the sample is huge \nand exceeds the machine\u2019s maximum force capability. In addition to this, the compression test \nrequires the sample has a high level of flat surface in order to carry the load uniformly otherwise \nthe non-uniformity of ceramics sample will produce cracks and propagate rapidly. Ceramics \nmaterials have very brittle nature and extremely small elastic deformation region; therefore, the \nspecimen without perfect flat surface could collapse completely before starting elastic \ncompression. On the other hand, ceramics are very difficult to machine in terms of dimension due \nto its brittleness and hardness.  \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 28\n\n \n The typical setup for impulse excitation measurement of Young\u2019s modulus and shear \nmodulus is shown in Fig. 2.8. Note that the location of microphone and place of tapping with \nimpulse is different in each case. The specimen must be placed on two nodes with distance of \n0.224 L (L= specimen length) to each end in Fig. 2.8(a) [99]. The specimen is required to be long \nand thin in order to give the best result of measurement as large aspect ratio will simplify the \ncalculation of geometry correction factor. \n\n       \n(a)                               (b) \n\nFig. 2.8: (a) setup for Young\u2019s modulus; (b) setup for shear modulus [99]. \n  \n\nThe measured waveform signal of damping sine wave is shown as in Fig. 2.9 used to \ncalculate the frequency of flexural/torsion mode with Fourier Transform (FT) and the frequency \nis then used to calculate the Young\u2019s and shear modulus according to ASTM standard [99]. \nUsually the damping sine waveform signal is a composition of several single frequencies \ndamping sine wave. The mathematical expression to the waveform from IE measurement \nx(t)=Aexp(-?t)sin(?t+?): Where, A is pre-component, ? describes the damping decrease of the \nsound in the solid and f in terms of ? is the natural frequency. Ideally only single frequency after \nFT shows up but it is rarely seen. Other vibrations from higher harmonic mode or ambient \nsupport or experiment environment are also possible to be recorded and show up in the frequency \ndomain after FT. One should use the most appropriate frequency for modulus calculation while \nothers give rise to either too high or too low modulus results. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 2.9: the general shape of waveform measured in IE experiment \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 29\n\n \nThe calculation of Young\u2019s modulus is based on specimen\u2019s weight and dimensions: \n\n2 3\n\n30.9465\nfmf LE T\n\nW t\n? ? ? ?\n\n= ? ? ? ? ?\n? ?? ?\n\n (2.12) \n\nWhere E=Young\u2019s modulus, ff=Flexural frequency, m=mass, L=length, W=width, t=thickness and \nT is correction coefficient which is defined for two cases when L/t>>20 and L/t<20 in ATSM \nstandard [99]. The IE technique is also applied to measure the shear modulus as shown in Fig. 2.8 \n(b). The shear modulus is determined by the specimen\u2019s dimension and weight as specified in \nASTM standard [99] in equation: \n\n( )\n\n24\n1\n\nfLmf BG\nWt A\n\n? ?\n= ? ?\n\n+? ?\n (2.13) \n\nWhere G=shear modulus, ft=torsion frequency, m=mass, L=length, t=Thickness, A, B=correction \ncoefficients. The correction coefficient A, B is dependent on the sample geometry which is \ndefined in ASTM [99]. \n \n\nThe Poisson ratio of ceramic foam is a reflection of the isotropy of cellular structure. The \ntheoretical evaluation of isotropic material gives rise to v=0.3. Poisson ratio can be calculated \nfrom measuring Young\u2019s modulus and shear modulus. However the Poisson ratio calculation is \nlimited to isotropic materials and the Poisson ratio of anisotropic materials can not be determined \nusing the impulse excitation technique. The relationship between E and G to calculate Poisson \nratio is given: \n\n1\n2\nE\nG\n\n? = ?  (2.14) \n\nThe Poisson ratio for ceramics material can also be calculated if this is not known prior to the \nexperiment of shear modulus. Phani et al [100] gives an estimate for isotropic ceramics porous \nstructure that the ratio E/G=0.391. Therefore, Poisson ratio can be calculated just by knowing E \nwhile shear modulus is difficult to be measured. In one word, the IE technique is particularly \nuseful to mechanically characterize brittle ceramic foams or porous structure. The damping factor \nmeasured in the IE experiment is a reflection of defects existing in the dense material which \ncannot be seen. Therefore IE technique is also a qualitative mean to evaluate of the specimen \nporosity as defect when sound is propagated and damped in the materials.  \n \n2.5 Thermal properties measurement  \n  \n\nDTA/TGA equipment was also used to characterise the phase transition/or chemical reaction \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 30\n\nby locating the exothermic or endothermic peak while TGA is used to characterise the weight loss \nduring temperature rising. The DTA is used to study the heat flow Changes in the sample, either \nexothermic or endothermic. The heat input into the sample can be detected relative to the inert \nreference. Therefore, a DTA curve is used to study materials transition that have occurred during \nheating/cooling, such as glass transitions, crystallization, melting and sublimation. The area under \na DTA peak is the enthalpy change and is not affected by the heat capacity of the sample. The \nDTA use Al2O3 as inert sample on one side of the system on the other hand, the materials was \nplaced with a voltmeter to record the power supplied. As temperature rises, the heat input into the \ninert sample will be equalized to that into the materials however when phase transition takes place \nthe heat into the sample will be deflected in the voltmeter as the power is used as latent heat while \nthe same amount of power is recorded for inert sample Al2O3. Therefore, the power under the \npeak area is considered to be enthalpy of the transition and the location of the exothermic or \nendothermic peak are considered to be the phase transition with maximum rate. \n\n \nThe thermal shock resistance was also carried out according to ASTM standard C1525-04 \n\n[101]. The retained flexural strength of ceramics after water quenching the specimens from \nelevated temperature was measured. This standard gives critical temperature at which the flexural \nstrength is decreased by at least 30%. Although the standard does not determine the thermal stress \ngenerated as consequence of temperature rising, it can be calculated as proposed in [102]: \n\n1thermal\nE T?\n\n?\n?\n\n? ?\n=\n\n?\n (2.15) \n\n?T is the temperature difference between the sample and quenching medium prior to the \nquenching, ? is linear thermal expansion coefficient while v is Poisson ratio and ? is the stress \nreduction factor. For very rapid heat transfer ? is defined as 1 [15]. Therefore re-arranging (2.15) \nby replacing thermal stress with flexural strength of ceramics body ?f, one could derive the \nanalytical expression of thermal shock resistance as below: \n\n(1 )f\nCT E\n\n? ?\n?\n?\n\n? =   (2.16) \n\n(2.16) is an useful equation by which one can estimate the thermal shock resistance via \nmeasure of linear thermal expansion coefficient, Young\u2019s modulus, and flexural strength as well \nas Poisson ratio which are easily done. However, one should be also aware of that (2.16) does not \ntake into account of thermal conductivity which has effect on ? in (2.15), hence the (2.16) is \nnormally regarded as estimate of performance and used for comparison purposes [15]. The (2.16) \ncorresponds to the minimum temperature difference required to generate thermal stress that is \nenough to nucleate macro flaws within the ceramics body that cause significant mechanical \nstrength degradation. However in practical, the thermal shock resistance is often much higher \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 31\n\nthan the calculated due to the porosity could dissipate the crack energy and hence stop the crack \npropagation. \n \n2.6 Computed X-ray Tomography  \n\n \nX-ray tomography is an imaging technique used to study the internal microstructure of a \n\nmaterial. It provides non-destructive test that reveals the actual 3D structure of the sample. In \nSEM experiment one could only obtain 2D information or surface after material fracture. In \ncontrast to this, X-ray tomography allows one to study the actual 3D shape of the microstructural \nobjects without any compromising to integrity. This provides an overwhelming advantage to \nmaterials scientist to investigate the composite material in which the embedded objects cannot be \nreadily examined [103]. The theory behind this technique is based on X-ray radiography when an \nX-ray radiation is illuminated on a sample the transmitted beam is recorded which is dependent \non its material absorption coefficient, such as density, the atomic number and the energy (when \nthe beam is monochromatic) [104]. A large number of radiographs shown in Fig. 2.10(a) by \nrotating the sample in the X-ray beam between 0o and 180o [103, 104] are obtained. Instrument \nsoftware is applied to the resulting radiograph images to produce 2D slice image in Fig. 2.10(b) \nand 3D volumetric structural information is accessible by adding up the 2D slice image as shown \nin Fig. 2.10(c) [103]. Provided the thickness of slice is small enough to ensure continuity of the \nstructure, for instance, an example of 3D structure of cellular materials after 3D reconstruction as \nshown in Fig. 2.11. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 2.10: Reconstruction (a) radiography image (b) 2D slice image (c) set of 2D slices obtain \n\nfrom scanning to be used in the reconstruction of 3D actual structure [103] \n \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 32\n\n \nFig. 2.11: 3D Tomography image of polymer foam [94] \n\n \nThe prerequisite for carrying out a good quantitative volumetric study is a high X-ray \n\nscattering contrast between the interested objects and background. The results reveal that X-ray \ntomography is very suitable to study cellular materials due to X-ray scattering contrast from the \nair and the strut materials is usually good enough to be processed by imaging analysis.  \n \n2.7 3D structure model and Finite Element Analysis \n  \n\nVery recently, numerical techniques such as Finite Element Analysis (FEA) have been \ndeveloped to simulate cellular materials\u2019 mechanical properties to Polyurethane foam [94, 105], \nPolyvinylchloride Foams [106] and Nickel metallic foam [107]. This was particularly successful \nusing computerized X-ray tomography to render actual 3D structure of foam for FEA calculation. \nHowever, X-ray tomography method only covers small fraction of the foam which may introduce \ninaccuracy when the foam\u2019s microstructure is not homogeneous. In addition, the high cost of FEA \nmethod that requires tremendous computing capacity may limit its application. It is noteworthy \nthat state-of-the-art X-ray tomography technique is able to provide resolution as good as 1 \u00b5m, \nthus leaving behind the study of smaller objects such as MWNTs (10-30 nm in diameter) \nembedded in composite material. Nevertheless, Tomography aided FEA method becomes more \nand more popular in composite material design to study mechanical properties of heterogeneous \nmaterials or components with non-trivial geometry, which can not be covered by analytical \napproach. We adopted this technique in study of cellular structure and mechanical property of the \n3D structure by FEA. It proves the effectiveness in using non-destructive testing method to study \nthe interior structure of ceramic foams, which, otherwise was impossible to study by any other \nmeans. The study starts with Tomography Image Processing using \u201cAMIRA\u201d or \u201cAVIZO\u201d which \nis commercially available to carry out the structure visualization. The structure was then \nconverted into model by ImageJ which is compatible with the finite element program \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 33\n\n\u201cAbaqus/CAE\u201d for simulation of mechanical properties. \n \n The reconstruction of 3D structure is preceded with steps below: \n\n1. Input the original slices image stack into AMIRA \n2. Displaying the bounding box to check the size of volume to process is suitable \n3. Applying Noise Reduction Filtering to smoothen the background  \n4. material labelling which distinguish the ceramics strut and air in slice image \n5. generate 3D structure of cellular structure \n6. Generate tetrahedron elements for grid file (*.inp) into FEM program \n\n \nOnce obtained the grid file, the file is used as input model into Abaqus/CAE for calculation. \n\nAbaqus/CAE is software developed by SIMULA, USA for finite element analysis. The structure \nproduced in AMIRA is applied with boundary conditions that no surface will move except in \nZ-axis direction there is an applied displacement. The strut properties of ceramics foam has to be \nspecified also before calculation. The Young\u2019s modulus and the Poisson ration are given from \nexperiment of the bulk ceramics. The displacement is applied uniformly downward to produce \ncompressive deformation and the force reacted as result of this displacement for this material is \ncalculated. The reaction force component in Z-axis is used to calculate the stress on the \ncompressed surface and hence the modulus. It is also noticed that the Von Mises stress is \ncalculated as output file and the stress distribution across the ceramics body will be shown in \ncolour contour map. This is useful since by comparing the calculated Von mises stress to the \nflexural strength from experiment we can determine when and where the ceramics will fracture \nand fail. The elastic properties can also be estimated from this simulation avoiding the machining \nhardship to ceramic foams introduced previously. The elastic properties of the ceramics foam by \ntaking into account of hollow structure inside struts are compared to the modulus from Impulse \nExcitation measurement to check the validity of the model and effectiveness of FEM analysis.  \n \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 34\n\nChapter 3: Experimental preparation \n \n3.1 Ceramic Suspension  \n  \nThe ceramics suspension also known as slurry is made by aqueous dispersion method. The \nprecursor powder was supplied by Rauschert. The powder is a mixture of natural minerals \ncontaining non-stoichiometric composition of Corundum (?-Al2O3), Talc (triclinic), ?-Quartz \n(SiO2), K-feldspar, Mullite (Al6Si2O13), Kaolinite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4), trace amount of Calcite, \nCristobalite, and glassy phase. The powder density measured by Pyconometry is around 3.0g/cm3 \nat 20oC. The suspension was made with a set of optimized parameters from previous work of \nSusana et al [83]. Hence, 45 vol% solid loading was applied by 0.8 wt.% Targon 1128 dispersant. \nEach batch of slurry contains 189.1 g of powder, 89.2 g of water and 1.5 g of Targon 1128 that \nwere mixed. The Targon 1128 was firstly added into the distilled water and then the precursor \npowder was slowly added into the mixture under mechanical stirring in a glass beaker of 200 ml. \nAfter mechanical stirring of 5 mins, the slurry was transferred into a plastic bottle filled with \nalumina balls of different sizes and ball milled. The as-prepared suspension contains a lot of \nparticle agglomerates in presence of dispersing agent. Therefore the suspension was subject to \nball milling at low speed only to destroy the particle agglomeration. The particle size will not be \nreduced versus time with modest force upon particle analysis by Laser diffraction method. The \nschematic illustration of preparation of suspension is shown in Fig. 3.1.  \n \n\n \nFig. 3.1: Cordierite suspension preparation and ball milling;  \n\n \n3.2 Slip casting and dry pressing   \n\n \nThe dense ceramic are prepared in two ways namely, slip casting and dry pressing. The slip \n\ncasting is based on the ceramics suspension prepared in previous section that is cast onto plaster \nmould until the cast body becomes completed dried. Then the cast body is transferred to oven at \n80oC for 24 h until it reaches constant mass. However the deformation of slip cast sample is \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 35\n\nserious due particle size segregation and a density gradient derived from a decreasing driving \nforce as cake thickness increases. The slip cast sample must be grounded to achieve parallelism of \nsurface for flexural strength measurement. The alternative route to prepare green body for \nflexural strength measure is using method introduced by A. Goel et al [108] that use 5 vol.% PVA \nsolution corresponding to 2.5 wt.% PVA+97.5 wt.% powder). In our case, the rectangular bars of \ngreen state were prepared with PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) solution prepared by the following: 1.7 \nwt.% PVA solution of 200 ml was magnetically stirred in warm water (65 oC) for 7h until the \nPVA is completed dissolved as the solution becomes transparent. The PVA solution was then \nsprayed onto the as-supplied granulated powder of 400 g in a rotary mixer for uniform coating of \nPVA. The mixture of PVA solution and powder was seen as paste-like material due to excessive \nhydration with big particle agglomeration. Therefore the paste was grounded to smaller particles \nand filtered with 500 \u00b5m sieve to achieve uniform particle distribution. The powder was then \ndried in air for 24 h and the initial hydration of aforementioned filtered powder must be measured \nby drying a batch of mass 3.2 g in an oven at 90 oC until it reaches constant mass. The hydration \nwas found around 15 wt. %. The complete time dependent drying behaviour of the \naforementioned powder is presented in Fig. 3.2.  \n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n \n\n \n\nhy\ndr\n\nat\nio\n\nn \n(w\n\nt.%\n)\n\ndrying time (mins)\n\nEquation: y = A*exp(-t/?) + t\n0\n  \n\nt0:-0.28975\nA:14.75238\n?:10.441\n\n \nFig. 3.2: drying behaviour of PVA solution coated precursor powder \n\n \nThe drying behaviour in Fig. 3.2 is an exponential decay function: y=A*exp(t/?)+t0 where, y \n\nis the hydration at time t from t=0 with pre-coefficient and decay constant of ?. Therefore the \nhydration could be controlled precisely by elapse of drying time with those parameters \ndetermined in Fig. 3.2. However, after applying the PVA solution, the pressed sample is still not \npressed well after drying in air for 1 day due to unsuitable humidity level as seen in Fig. 3.3. \nTherefore, the drying-pressing strategy needs to be re-evaluated in our investigation to find the \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 36\n\noptimal conditions of dry pressing. \n \n\n \nFig 3.3: dry-pressed bar of 1.7wt.% PVA binder with 15wt.% hydration \n\n \nFig. 3.4 show dry pressing behaviour with 2 hydration 0 and 2.5 wt. % at the same PVA \n\nbinder wt. %. The hydration was achieved by following the time dependent drying curve in Fig. \n3.2. It is clearly illustrated that a decrease of the hydration to 2.5 wt. % in powder enabled a very \nsuccessful pressing with perfect shape as seen in Fig. 3.4. However the bar has to be completely \ndried before sintering. Therefore, further decrease of hydration to 0 wt. % was test for shaping \ncapability. The bars however, showed small cracks at the edge or corner during handling or \ntransporting in Fig. 3.4. This proved that completely dried powder with PVA binder is not \npreferential for dry-pressing. A suitable level of hydration is beneficiary to make the sample \ncrack-resistant during handling and pre-sintering. With experimental evidences shown above, we \nconclude that at most 2.5 wt. % hydrated powder is suitable for dry pressing however we expect \nto see a more optimized hydration between 2.5wt. % and 0 wt. % upon further experiments.  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 3.4: dry-pressed bar of 1.7wt. % PVA binder with 2.5wt. % hydration (left two); with 0wt. % \n\nhydration (right two). The cracks are highlighted with red rectangles \n \n3.3 Suspension impregnation of polymer replica   \n\n \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 37\n\nPolymer replica method is used to make ceramics foam. The polymer was supplied with three \nmicrostructure specification, namely 8 PPI, 22 PPI, and 30 PPI (PPI, Pore Per Inch). A visual \ninspection of the cell microstructure reveals that the 8 PPI and 22 PPI foam has an open cell \nstructure. However 30 PPI polymer foam do not show significant open cell structure.  \n \n\nThe manufacturing of ceramics foams is based on polymeric replica impregnated with \nceramics slurry and involves multiple stages: The first step is to prepared ceramics slurry that has \nbeen introduced previously. The step by step procedures of making of ceramics foams at specific \nwt. % dispersant in this investigation and characterization are also presented in Fig. 3.5.  \n\n   \n\nFig. 3.5: step by step procedures and plan in making ceramics foam.  \n\n \nThe 8 PPI, 22 PPI and 30 PPI polymer replicas were cut into cube or rectangular shapes for \n\nimpregnation. Cubic or rectangular shape is suitable to perform compression test or Impulse \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 38\n\nExcitation method. The polymer replica was impregnated with ceramic suspension with and \nwithout thickening agent to explore the best strategy to obtain homogeneous impregnation. The \nprocedures of impregnation are following: i) pour the suspension onto the polymer replica; hand \npressing should be applied to allow the suspension to flow into the interior structure of the \npolymer replica. However, excess suspension usually stay on the surface of polymer struts and, \ntherefore, the coated polymer replica should be squeezed after impregnation to remove excessive \nslurry. The amount of suspension coating the polymer replica can be characterized by the weight \nratio of polymer struts (PS) + impregnating suspension (PS+IS) to polymer struts (PS).  \n \n\nThe polymer replica is referred to the polymer foam without impregnation. In our \ninvestigation, 300 mL of 45 vol% solid loading ceramic slurry was require to impregnate 200-300 \ncm3 polymer replicas with dispersant and thickening agents. The weight ratio (PS+IS)/PS was \nrecorded from the time of impregnation until the slurry impregnated foam was completely dried. \nThis is proved to be crucial to obtain a good dispersion of cordierite slurry which has high \nviscosity. The slurry was impregnated at room temperature and placed in air for 24 h in order to \nremove the water gently to avoid crack on the surface. Then the green ceramic foams were \nsubject to drying in oven at 90 oC for 12 h to completely dry the foam until constant mass before \nsintering.  \n \n\nThere are two main parameters can be varied in dispersion preparation, such as the solid \nloading (vol. %) and the amount of dispersant (wt. %). The combination of these two parameters \nwill be seen as the most influential factors to the mechanical properties. However, we only use \nthe optimized parameters according to Susana et al [83] with 45 vol.% loading and 0.8 wt.% \nTargon 1128. In our investigation we examined the effect of rheological property on \nimpregnation behaviour by adding 0.2 and 0.5 wt. % thickening agent \u201cCMC\u201d (Carboxymethyl \nCellulose) to increase the viscosity of the suspension. The viscosity was seen very influential in \nthe impregnation for instance, the suspension without CMC show high flow ability that hardly \nany suspension will rest on the polymer struts after impregnation and the suspension settled to the \nbottom. On the other hand, highly viscous suspension was obtained by adding 0.5 wt.% CMC \nafter 1 h mixing in ball milling showed insufficient flow character for a proper impregnation of \nsmaller polymeric structures, resulting in highly inhomogeneous distribution of the suspension \nupon squeezing. This has important negative effects to the homogeneity hence the applicability of \nthe as-produced foams. Based on this fact, 0.2 wt.% CMC added suspension was chosen as \noptimal condition to prepare the ceramic suspensions with a good ability to coat the fine \nstructured polymeric replicas, while suspensions containing 0.5 wt.% CMC were selected for \nimpregnating larger pore size (8 PPI) replicas.  \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 39\n\n \nThe drying behaviour was recorded in order to determine the optimal weight fraction of \n\nsuspension to be impregnated with polymer replica. This is due to the fact that removal of \nexcessive suspension after impregnation was manual based and it is not easy to control the \nsuspension fraction by hand squeezing unless the weight is recorded. It turns out to be the most \neffective parameter in terms of controlling the homogeneity of the foam from impregnation.  \n \n3.4 Sintering and Post-treatment \n\n \nSintering was carried out for bulk ceramics and ceramics-coated polymer foam. The sintering \n\ntemperature was conducted at 1250 oC and 1350 oC. This choice is based on XRD study shown \nlater on that cordierite phase only form within temperature window above 1250oC. In addition, \n1350 oC is the maximum temperature of the furnace available for sintering ceramic coated \npolymer replica. Sintering at higher temperature such as 1425 oC and 1500 oC is possible for bulk \nceramics. The bulk ceramics sintered at 1500 oC showed significant fractures or defects. This was \nattributed to formation of liquid phase above 1460 oC due to cordierite melting and hence the gas \nbubble occurred appeared in liquid phase. These results showed good properties were unlikely to \nbe obtaining for sintering temperatures higher than 1350 oC. Stepwise sintering experiments were \nalso carried out at 950 \u00baC and 1050 oC to study the phase transformation of original precursor \npowder along the temperature profile. The sintering schedule for slip cast bulk ceramics sample is \nillustrated in Fig. 3.6, consisting of a ramp of 5 \u00baC/min up to 1350 oC, a holding time of 2 h, \nfollowed by natural cooling.  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 3.6: Sintering schedule of bulk ceramics \n\n \nThe coated polymer replicas were sintered following a different schedule due to the slow \n\nburning out of the polymer struts. Susana [83] described the burning out of polymer struts should \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 40\n\nbe carried out gradually with small temperature ramp rate in order to minimise the crack of coated \nceramics due to different thermal expansion properties of polymer and ceramics. The thermal \nheated stress will crack the ceramics before its densification if heating was carried out too rapidly. \nTherefore the temperature ramp for polymer burning out stage was set as 1oC/min up to 600 oC, \nfollowed by a holding time of 1 h. After the burning out, a ramp 5oC/min from 600 oC to 1250 or \n1350 oC was applied with a holding time of 2 h at the maximum set temperatures. After that, the \nfurnace switched off automatically and the samples cooled down naturally to room temperature in \nthe furnace. The sintering temperature versus time history is presented in Fig. 3.7. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 3.7: sintering schedule of ceramics coated polymer foam \n\n \nSintered ceramic foams of 8 PPI and 22 PPI sintered at 1350 oC for 2 h were obtained as \n\nshown in Fig. 3.8. The ceramic foam was from impregnation of 0.5 wt. % CMC in suspension \nwhich increases the viscosity in order to avoid the de-coating of slurry from the surface of the \nstruts. This was particularly beneficiary as seen in the Fig. 3.8 that 8PPI has homogeneous \nstructure and excellent pore connection (left and middle) from visual inspection. The \nimpregnation showed that the slurry could easily flow through the cellular structure and \naccumulate at the bottom, there 0.5 wt. % CMC was added to the slurry. However, the slurry the \nsame slurry with 0.5 wt. % CMC showed less beneficiary impregnation to 22 PPI foam due to \nsmaller pore size and higher viscous resistance to impregnation. 22 PPI foam started exhibiting \npartial closed cell with small fraction. The impregnation of 30 PPI foam with the 0.5 wt. % CMC \nslurry revealed to be completely ineffective as shown in Fig. 3.9. A visual inspection indicated \nthat the as obtained ceramic foam consisted almost of closed cell structure and there were very \nfew open cells. This is not favourable for most typical ceramic foams application such as molten \nmetal filtration, catalyst coating and so on. This suggested that the rheological property should be \ntailor-made for various kinds of polymer replicas with different pore sizes.  \n \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 41\n\n   \n\nFig. 3.8: 8 PPI and 22 PPI foams (45 vol. %, \n0.8 wt. % Targon) with 0.5 wt. % CMC;   \n\nFig. 3.9: 30 PPI foam (45 vol. %, 0.8 wt. % \nTargon) with 0.5 wt. % CMC (1 h)\n\n \n\n Fig. 3.10 next shows that homogeneous 22 PPI ceramic foams could be obtained when \nimpregnation was made with a suspension containing 0.2 wt. % CMC, which exhibited suitable \nrheological properties to penetrate the sponge and coated the struts with enough adhesive force. \nQuantitative homogeneity could be referred to Impulse Excitation technique, however, Fig. 3.10 \n(a) showed a high level of open cell which promise its application use; On the other hand, Fig. \n3.10 (b) showed considerable closed cell structure on the side of the foam. We concluded that the \napparent closed cell on the side wall was due to the slurry concentration due to a suction effect of \nthe slurry upon recovering its initial height after squeezing. However this is considered not as \ndetrimental effect since the closed cell structure on side could provide additional mechanical \nstrength but not deteriorating the flow capability through the cellular structure from top to bottom. \nThis also suggested need of a quantitative mean to characterize the impregnation for completely \nopen cell structure on top/bottom and side surfaces to ensure the distribution of the slurry is \nidentical in each processing batch. For instance, the initial weight of slurry after impregnation \nwith a highly open cell structure should be recorded and the ratio between the initial weight and \nweight of polymer replica should be calculated to determine the optimal impregnation parameters \nfor 8 PPI and 22 PPI foams.  \n  \n\n The 22 PPI foam seen in Fig. 3.10 was impregnated with slurry modified with 0.2 wt. % \nCMC at (PS+IS)/PS ratio of 20. Fig. 3.10 (a) and (b) showed the top and side view of ceramics \nfoam. A comparison was made from Fig. 3.10 (c) and (d) show the top view and side view of \npolymer replica before impregnation. This experiment also suggested that a suitable weight ratio \nbetween initial slurry to polymer replica could provide highly open cell structure. However, the \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 42\n\nopen cell on side of ceramics foam was seen very poor due to squeezing after impregnation to \nremove excessive slurry. The slurry was then remained on both sides. Nevertheless, this is not a \nproblem for application as the ceramics foam with enough connectivity in its top-bottom \ndirection is required for actual application. The high concentration of ceramics struts on side \ncould provide enhanced additional strength without affecting any filtration applications. \n\n  \n\nFig. 3.10: (a) top view of the 22 PPI foam;    (b) side view of 22 PPI foam  \n\n   \n\n(c) top view of the 22 PPI foam before \nimpregnation;                         \n\n(d) side view of 22 PPI foam before \nimpregnation \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 43\n\nChapter 4: Results and Analysis  \n \nThe characterization of starting material is very important for understanding final properties \n\nof the bulk ceramics with different sintering schedules. In addition, the parameters such as \nparticle size distribution, of as-supplied powder may also affect the green body properties that are \nstudied. The rheological behaviour of ceramic suspensions prepared as describe in Chapter 3 was \nstudied. The drying-out behaviour of impregnated foams was shown in details by evolution of \nweight ratio (PS+IS)/PS. The IE measurement evaluates the homogeneity of foam and was \nperformed for selective samples. In addition, X-ray tomography was conducted to study the \ninterior structure of foams and provided 3D actual structural model for Finite Element Analysis. \nOn the other hand, the properties of dense struts of ceramic foams, i.e., microstructure, \nmechanical properties and compositional variation as function of sintering temperature and time \nwere also studied for optimizing the processing conditions. The dielectric properties were also \nstudied in order to learn about the best sintering schedule and the potential of sintered ceramics \nfor electronic applications. \n \n4.1 Characterization of starting powder \n  \n4.1.1 Particle size distribution \n\n \nFig. 4.1 shows the evolution of particle size distribution of as-received powder versus ball \n\nmilling time. The as-received powder has a wide distribution and large mean particle size (the \nsize for which half vol. % of the particles is smaller and the other half is bigger) of 13.2 \u00b5m with \na tail extending up to > 100 \u00b5m. It is supposed that larger sizes are due to the presence of particle \nagglomerates and this was confirmed by SEM later on. Fig. 4.1 also shows that particle size \ndistribution gradually narrows down and means size shifts towards smaller sizes with increasing \nball milling time. After 24 h of ball milling the und mean value was ~6.8 \u00b5m, with a small \nfraction of tail extending up to ~50 \u00b5m. The mean particle sizes decreased to ~4.7 to ~2.5 \u00b5m \nafter 1 and 2 weeks of ball milling, respectively. All suspension subject to ball milling has been \nprepared as previously described with 0.8 wt. % dispersant of Targon 1128. \n\n \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 44\n\n0.1 1 10 100\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n4.5\n\n5.0\n\n 6.808 \u00b5m\n\nD\nif\n\nfe\nre\n\nnt\nia\n\nl V\nol\n\num\ne \n\n%\nParicle size (\u00b5m)\n\n No ball milling\n Ball milling for 24h\n Ball milling for 1 week\n Ball milling for 2 week\n\n13.19 \u00b5m\n\n 4.702 \u00b5m\n\n 2.251 \u00b5m\n\n \nFig. 4.1: particle distribution of as-received powder versus ball milling time \n\n \nFrom the green body compacting point of view, smaller particle size and narrower particles \n\nsize distribution lead to more homogeneous microstructure in the green body and hence less \ndeformation after sintering. Neto et al [81] summarized the effect of particle size in relation to the \nsintering and concluded that particle size which normally limits the reactivity from the mixture of \nnatural materials such as Talc, kaolin and alumina as most typical ingredients. Destruction of \naggregates increases the specific area and reduces the distance between the particles and hence \nlowers the sintering temperature at which cordierite phase forms. Meanwhile, the particle size \ndistribution plays important role in green density gradient in slip cast sample due to gravity effect \nduring consolidation. The clogging effect that occurs in slip casting might even predominate over \nthe gravity effect as explained by Ferreira et al [109]. In one word, the occurrence of particle \nsegregation from gravity or clogging during the consolidation process will deteriorate the shaping \nability and the reliability of the green body. The inhomogeneity of the particle packing also \ncauses deformations after sintering due to differential shrinkage. In addition, the morphology of \nthe particles also determines the packing ability of a powder with rounded particles being \nconsidered to have higher ability to closely fill the space. Milewski et al [110] showed that the \ngreen density could be significantly decreased when increasig the particle aspect ratio. The SEM \nobservations in our investigation later on revealed that the particles of precursor powder are not \nspherical but exhibit a platelet-like morphology due to existence of talc and kaolinite.  \n\n \nIn the present investigation, dense and cellular ceramics were made from the suspension with \n\nball milling for 1 week in order to achieve good reactivity and compacting ability with mean \nparticle size of 4.7 \u00b5m.  \n \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 45\n\n4.1.2 XRD study of composition \n \nThe starting powder consists of natural mineral materials without disclosed composition. \n\nTherefore X-ray analysis was carried out with Philip PANAnalytical X\u2019Pert Multipurpose Powder \nDiffractometer (MPD) at Central Analytical Lab (LCA), University of Aveiro. Fig. 4.2 shows the \nXRD pattern of starting powder from 8o to 95o with angular step of 0.02o. The present of minor \nphase or deviations from the stoichiometric cordierite will lead to the formation of secondary \nphases as predicted from the MgO-SiO2-Al2O3 phase diagram in Fig.1.1. In such context, the \nquantitative phase analysis (QPA) based on X-ray diffraction using standard silicon powder as \ninternal reference was conducted. This method using internal reference is also favourable in \nquantifying glassy phase in reaction in big fraction. \n\n \n\n5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 4 0 4 5 5 0 5 5 6 0 6 5 7 0 7 5 8 0 8 5 9 0 9 5 1 0 0\n\n0\n\n2 0 0 0\n\n4 0 0 0\n\n6 0 0 0\n\n8 0 0 0\n\n1 0 0 0 0\n\n1 2 0 0 0\n\n1 4 0 0 0\n\n1 6 0 0 0\n\n1 8 0 0 0\n\n2 0 0 0 0\n\nIn\nte\n\nns\nity\n\n2 ? /o\n\nC o ru n d u m\n? -q u a rtz\nT a lc\nK a o lin ite\nm u llite\nk -fe ld s p a r\nc ris to b a lite\n\n0 1 -0 7 4 -1 0 8 1\n0 1 -0 7 8 -1 2 5 3\n\n0 0 -0 0 3 -0 8 8 1\n0 0 -0 0 1 -0 5 2 7\n\n0 0 -0 0 1 -0 6 1 3\n\n0 0 -0 0 1 -0 7 0 5\n0 0 -0 0 3 -0 2 6 7\n\n \nFig. 4.2: XRD phase analysis of starting powder \n\n \nThe XRD results revealed the powder is a complex mixture of several natural materials or \n\nrare synthetic mineral such mullite. It contains at least of 7 types of minerals of crystalline phase \nnamely corundum, ?-quartz, Talc, Kaolinite, mullite, K-feldspar and Cristobalite (product of \npre-calcinations of kaolinite) with ICDD PDF code. However there are still very few minor peaks \nleft un-indexed and we consider that this is difficult due to the complexity of the as-supplied \nmaterial. It is also noticed that there is a hump from 15-30\u00ba, which Johnson [111] has attributed to \nthe presence of kaolinite calcined at low temperature (900 oC). The raw powder also shows \nexistence of mullite, probably derived from kaolinite calcined at higher temperatures. \n \n\nThe silicon and starting powder were mixed by planetary ball milling for homogeneity and \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 46\n\nthen studied by XRD. The phase quantities were determined by Rietveld method as shown in Fig. \n4.2. The Rietveld refinement plots show the green (observed) and the red (calculated) curves, as \nwell as the difference (blue) curve between measured and calculated data. \n \n\n \n \n\nFig. 4.3: Rietveld refinement of Cordierite raw mix powder, Rw (%) =17, Sig=4.2 \n \n\nFig. 4.3 shows a reluctant agreement between the experimental and simulated curves. \nNevertheless, the agreement is acceptably good provided the complexity of the starting material. \nThe QPA was performed with software \u201cSiroquant\u201d developed by Sietronics Australia \n(http://siroquant.com/) under agreement of trial use to the program supplier. The result was \nvalidated by comparing the wt. % (16.68 wt. %) of silicon added to the starting powder to the wt. \n% refined from Rietveld refinement, 20 wt. %. The slight difference is likely due to imperfection \nof crystallinity of silicon powder. The result of quantitative phase compositions after \nre-calibration respective to pre-determined silicon wt.5 is shown in Table 4.1. \n\n \nTable 4.1: minerals and composition of as-supplied powder \n\nMinerals Chemical formula Wt.% ICDD Code \nCorundum Al2O3 29.40 01-074-1081 \nTalc (triclinic) Mg3Si4O10(OH)2 18.00 00-003-0881 \n??Quartz SiO2 16.08 01-078-1253 \nK feldspar KAlSi3O8 8.64 00-001-0705 \nMullite Al6Si2O13 8.52 00-001-0613 \nKaolinite Al2Si2O5(OH)4 8.37 00-001-0527 \nCristobalite SiO2(HT Polymorph) 4.64 00-003-0267 \nGlassy phase n/a 6.35 n/a \n\n \nSiroquant is newly appeared commercial software in Rietveld refinement for QPA and some \n\ncomments are given by the supplier regarding the Siroquant results: the Chi2 or goodness of fit \nnumber is approximately 3.4 and this is typical and Rw factor is good.

This is acceptable \nconsidering the crystallinity of the sample. The Cristobalite phase is not a perfect fit meaning that \nthe existence of this phase is in doubt but it is believed this was the best option. In one word, \nSiroquant provides quite satisfactory results compared to all programs available. However, the \nprice of such program limited our further use after trial. In our following investigation, only \nMAUD is used to conduct QPA for XRD. \n \n\nAs previously addressed in 1.2 Chapter 1, sintering of cordierite via solid state route usually \nrequires temperature above 1350 oC. In the present study, Talc and kaolin in the composition are \nfound that would supposedly decrease the crystallization temperature, compared to the synthesis \nusing pure metal oxides according to [11]. Also, Antisiferov et al [30] showed that compositional \nvariations significantly affect the properties of cordierite and a preliminary calcinations of Talc \nhas a considerable influence on the mechanical properties of cordierite formed by single stage \nsolid state sintering. And, Talc could be obtained from a blend composition containing feldspar or \npegmatite. Therefore, n the composition of Rauschert blend we found the K-feldspar which is \nadded as fluxing agent in order to reduce liquidation temperature and hence allowing sintering in \npresence of liquid phase. \n \n4.1.3 DTA/TGA study  \n\n \nThe thermal properties and the sintering schedule of the as-supplied starting powder were \n\nstudied by DTA/TGA. The DTA/TGA ramp rates were set at 5 oC/min (the same used in the \nsintering - Fig. 4.4) and at 10 oC/min (Fig. 4.5). \n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n TG/%\n DTA\n\nTemperature(oC)\n\nT\nG\n\n/%\n\nHeating rate:5oC/min\n\n-2.0\n\n-1.5\n\n-1.0\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\nD\nT\n\nA\n/m\n\nV\n\n507oC\n\n704oC\n\n1309oC\n\n \nFig. 4.4: DTA/TGA study of the as-received powder \n\n \nFig. 4.4. shows that precursor powder underwent weight loss steps characteristics of the \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 48\n\nminerals present in the composition, namely of Kaolinite at about 450-550 \u00baC \u2013 centred at about \n\n507 \u00baC and due to the loss of structural water, and Talc (and eventually minor amounts of other \n\nassociated minerals such as Chlorite, Chrysotile and Calcite) at about 680-730 \u00baC\u2013centred at \n\nabout 704 \u00baC, and at 880-940 \u00baC, due to the loss of structural water and accompanied by the \n\nformation of ensatite (MgSiO3) and silica [20, 112]. Fig. 4.4 also shows that DTA signal has low \n\nintensity to noise ratio, probably due to the low heating rate that mitigates the thermal differential \n\neffects between the sample and the standard material. \n\n \n\nFig. 4.5 shows the DTA/TGA plots of precursor powder at a heating rate of 10 oC/min. It can \n\nbe seen that the endothermic peaks were shifted to higher temperatures, as expected, while the \n\npeaks appear are of higher intensity. The result also showed that the signal to noise ratio was \n\nimproved for measurement at higher heating rate. Gonzales-Velasco et al [113] studied DTA \n\ncurve of mixture with similar composition of 20.6 wt.% alumina, 34.5 wt.% kaolin, 40.4 wt.% \n\ntalc, and 4.5 wt.% silica at higher rate, i.e., 15 oC per min, in which the first endothermic peak \n\nwas in range of 550-650 oC while the second is around 900-950 oC. It appeared that the higher the \n\ntemperature ramp the bigger shift to higher temperature peak, therefore the DTA study of phase \n\ntransformation should be used with care when the heating conditions vary. \n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1  TG/%\n DTA\n\nTemperature(oC)\n\nT\nG\n\n/%\n\n-10\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0Heating rate: 10oC/min\n\nD\nT\n\nA\n/m\n\nV\n\n513oC 754oC\n\n \nFig. 4.5: DTA/TGA curves for as-received powder at 10oC/min \n\n \nThe peak at first endothermic around between 500-550 oC also corresponds to transition of \n\nkaolin into metakaolin by losing hydroxyl group, OH and transition from ?-quartz to ?-quartz \naccording to [113]. The XRD study in Fig. 4.6 revealed the result that kaolin\u2019s peak at 12.5o has \ndisappeared since metakaolin has amorphous structure. It is apparent that second endothermic \npeak was followed around 700-750 oC and this is supposed corresponding to the transition of Talc \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 49\n\nto protoensatite which is high temperature polymorph of ensatite (Mg2Si2O6), amorphous silica \nand water vapour according to [113]. However, the Quantitative Phase Analysis suggested that \nrelative wt. % Talc has decreased but no apparent identification of protoensatite therefore the \nprotoensatite transition is not mandatory.  \n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\n6000\n\n7000\n\n8000\n\n9000\n\n10000\n\n11000\n\n12000\n\n13000\n\n14000\n\n15000\n?-cristobalite?-SiO2\n\nkaolinite: disappearing at 530oC\nMullite:decreasing (530->750oC)\nTalc: decreasing (530->750oC)\n\n750oC 2h 5oC/min\nof\n\nfs\net\n\n in\nte\n\nns\nity\n\n2?\n\nraw powder\n\n530oC 2h 5oC/min\n\n?-SiO2\ncristobalite\n\n(at 750oC)\n\n \nFig.4.6: XRD for powder calcined at 530oC and 750oC for 2h; \n\n \nFig. 4.7 analyzed the phase fraction in the mixture calcined at first and second endothermic \n\npeaks. Kaolinite has not been included since it completely transformed to metakaolin above \n530oC. It is noted that the relative ratio between ?-quartz and ?-Cristobalite varied significantly \nfrom 530 oC to 750 oC. However, the wt.% increase of mullite and corundum was not in \nagreement to the result by [113] in which the decomposition of metakaolin should increase the \nwt.% of mullite and corundum since the total weight of the mixture was decrease detected by TG \ncurve. The likely reason to account for this difference could be lying with the fact that the \nDTA/TG test was run in inert atmosphere (Ar) while the sintering was conducted in air rich in \noxygen. However, oxidization could not affect the amount of mullite and corundum. The problem \nwas considered due to presence of other components of materials present in the starting powder \nthat is not revealed due to commercial secret. Nevertheless, an in-situ XRD experiment in \nvacuum is expected to address the problem discussed above. \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 50\n\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n8\n\n10\n12\n14\n16\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n w\nt%\n\nTemperature of heat treatment(oC)\n\n Quartz\n\n w\nt%\n\n Corrundum\n\n w\nt%\n\n Talc\n\n w\nt%\n\n Mullite\n\n \n\n w\nt%\n\n ?-cristabolite\n\n \n      Fig.4.7: Rietveld Analysis of composition change in DTA (RT-750oC) \n\n \nFinally, the peaks above 1300oC does not correspond to any transition of single oxides in the \n\nprecursor powder but only their fusion according to [113]. The peak that is seen around 1309oC is \ntherefore associated with the solid state reaction to form a-Cordierite that takes place between \n1250-1400oC according to [113]. This study was also carried out in our XRD with variable \nsintering temperature and similar agreement was found.  \n\n \n4.1.4 SEM study of morphology \n\n \nSEM studied the particle morphology and size distribution of starting powder. Fig. 4.8 shows \n\nstrong particle agglomeration from the as-supplied precursor powder. It is also seen that the \npowder is in laminar morphology and the laminar structure appears to be in range of 2-10 \u00b5m \nsimilar to that found by particle size analyzer in Fig. 4.1. Those laminar flakes that situated at the \ntop surface of the bigger particle underneath are picked up and a semi-quantitative image analysis \nwith Feret diameters (The longest distance between any two points along the selection boundary \nof particle) of particles were evaluated by ImageJ* to determine the particle size distribution in \nFig. 4.9. \n\n \n\n* ImageJ is free-of-charge software dedicated to digital image processing and calculation developed by \nNational Institute of Health, USA. http://imageJ.org \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 51\n\n \nFig. 4.8: laminar structure of as-received powder \n\n \nFig. 4.9 shows image analysis results from measurement of particles\u2019 dimensions along its \n\nlongest axis. The number of particles that fall into certain size range is plotted versus the particle \nsize therefore one could also obtain a semi-quantitative particle size distribution. The distribution \nshowed that the most probable particle size is around 16 \u00b5m which drop significantly over 25 \u00b5m \nand approach to zero when the particle sizes is over 40 \u00b5m. This result is in agreement to the \nparticle analysis that is found by laser diffraction around 13.19 \u00b5m. \n\n0 10 20 30 40 50\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n \n\nnu\nm\n\nbe\nr o\n\nf p\nar\n\ntic\nle\n\ns\n\nparticle size (um)\n\n particle number counts \n trace interpolation of data\n\n \nFig. 4.9: particle size distribution by Image Analysis \n\n \n4.2 Rheological and drying behaviour \n \n\nThe rheological properties of the suspension prepared with 45 solid vol.% loading and \ndispersed with 0.8 wt.% Targon 1128 were characterised the flow ability and viscosity. The ideal \nsuspension must have adequate fluid character so as to impregnate the polymer replica thoroughly \nand uniformly, even for small cell size foams such as 22 PPI. However, it is difficult to make a \ngood impregnation when the viscosity is too low and fluid character is too accentuated. This is \nparticularly important in case of impregnating 8 PPI polymer which has rather large cell size. The \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 52\n\nviscous character of the suspension is expected to be appropriately adjusted to enable a thin and \nuniform coating layer on the polymer struts.  \n\n \nFig. 4.10 (upper portion) shows the flow (shear stress vs. shear rate) curves, and the \n\ncorresponding viscosity vs. shear rate curves, respectively, for: (1) the starting suspension \n(containing 45 vol.% solids loading dispersed with 0.8 wt.% Targon in absence of thickening \nagent); (2) the starting suspension with added 0.2 wt.% of CMC as thickening agent; (3) the \nstarting suspension with added 0.5 wt.% of CMC as thickening agent; (4) the suspension (3) but \ntested a second time after being at rest for 2 min. The pink curve in Fig. 4.10 (bottom, left), is the \nwater dynamics viscosity ~0.001003 at RT for comparison [114]. \n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n\n1E-3\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n\n \n\n \n\nSh\nea\n\nr S\ntr\n\nes\ns \n\n(P\na)\n\n 1st suspension with 0.5 wt.% CMC      2nd suspension  with 0.5wt.% CMC\n suspension  with 0.2 wt.% CMC     suspension  with no CMC\n\nshear thinning\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\n 1st suspension  with 0.5 wt.% CMC\n 2nd suspension  with 0.5 wt.% CMC\n suspension  with 0.2 wt.% CMC\n suspension  with no CMC\n water at 20oC \n\n \n\n \n\nV\nis\n\nco\nsi\n\nty\n (P\n\nas\n)\n\nShear Rate (1/s)\n\n 1st suspension with 0.5 wt.% CMC\n 2nd suspension with 0.5 wt.% CMC\n suspension with 0.2 wt.% CMC\n suspension with no CMC\n\n \n\n \n\nShear Rate (1/s)  \nFig. 4.10: rheology of 45 vol% solid suspension, 0.8wt. % Targon  \n\nat different, 0,0.2,0.5 wt.% CMC \n \n\nFrom Fig. 4.10 (top), it can be seen that suspension (1) exhibits shear thinning behaviour \nalong the whole shear rate range tested. The shear thinning characteristics within the low shear \nrate range (up to about 385 1/s) gradually accentuated with increasing amounts of CMC (curves 2 \n&amp; 3). However, the shear stress reaches maximum values at about 385 1/s), decreasing as the \nshear rate further increases. Such a decrease can be interpreted as: (i) a break down effect of \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 53\n\nCMC chains under high shear rates. In that case, the resulting shorter molecular chains will not be \nable to bind to the same number of particles as before, and the viscosity is expected to decrease; \n(ii) an alignment of the adsorbed polymer chains along the flow direction, thus offering less \nresistance to flow. In order to ascertain which of the above phenomena would prevail in the \npresent circumstances, the suspension (3) was tested a second time after being at rest for 2 min. \nThe resulting curve 4 shows an overall similar trend, but with less levels of shear stress being \nrequired to deform the system. These results support the hypothesis that the CMC chains are \nsomewhat degraded under high shear rates, but do not contradict the possibility for the adsorbed \npolymer chains to alignment along the flow direction. Accordingly, both should be considered at \nthe present stage. More detailed studies will be required to shed further light on this issue, \nincluding higher number of repeated shear rate/shear stress tests with the same suspension and \nlonger rest times between the tests, which are beyond the scope of this thesis.  \n\n \nThe relevant practical information that can be drawn from Fig. 4.10 with the aim of pursuing \n\nthe objectives of thesis are as follows:  (i) increasing added amounts of CMC enhance the \nstructuring effect of the suspensions at rest and near rest conditions, therefore, hindering the flow \nafter impregnation of the polymeric replicas, thus contributing to obtain ceramic foams with \nuniform density; (ii) CMC binder should be dosed according to the structure of the polymeric \nsponge replicas; (iii) the suspensions with added CMC should not be submitted to high shear rate \nregimes since the degradation of polymeric chains occurring under that conditions will alter the \nrheological properties and thus, the control over the process. \n \n\nAnother way to characterize the suspension impregnation behaviour is to study the weight \nchange of the polymer strut immediately after impregnation until fully dried. The polymer foam is \noften excessively coated and the excess suspension might block the cell open structure. The \ncontrol of impregnation and open cell ratio vs. close cell can be obtained by the amount of \nceramics slurry impregnated onto polymer struts. The experiment of impregnation vs. polymer\u2019s \nweight is illustrated in Fig. 4.11 and Fig. 4.12. The polymer after impregnation has to be squeezed \nto remove apparent excessive slurry to leave most of the cellular structure as open cells. However, \nif the slurry was removed too much the coating will be inadequate to cover the struts. Therefore, a \ntrial-and-error experiment was planned to achieve homogeneous open cell structure and the \n(PS+IS) vs. drying time was recorded. It was found that the (PS+IS)/PS weight ratios have to be \ndifferent for the 8 PPI foams if homogeneous coatings are to be obtained.

However, the relative density is not straightforward to obtain since the \nceramic has a complex composition instead of being monophonic and monolithic. SEM study was \nperformed to characterize the porosity of 2D surface which was assisted with quantitative image \nanalysis under the assumption that 3D porosity is represented from image analysis. The porosity \nis related to relative density and compared to density calculation from XRD and relative density \nmeasurement by Archimedes method. The thermal expansion properties and thermo-mechanical \nstability (thermal shock resistance) are relevant for refractory applications. The foams made of \ncordierite-mullite ceramics were studied with non-destructive Computed X-ray tomography \nyielding actual 3D information of microstructure and providing the basis of numerical simulation \nfor mechanical properties. Impulse Excitation technique was used to measure the Young\u2019s \nmodulus and foam\u2019s homogeneity in order to counter the problem of machining the ceramics with \nprecise geometry. Flexural and Compressive strength are characterized by unidirectional \ncompression to give basic parameters for mechanical properties. In addition to this, the cordierite \nis also one of the most promising materials to replace current Integrated Circuits (IC) substrate \nthat electronics industry requires due to its low-? (dielectric constant). Therefore dielectric \nproperties are shown at Room temperature. \n \n4.3.1 XRD study  \n\n \nFig. 4.13 showed result of X-ray pattern from the sintered product of powder raw mix. The \n\npattern was analyzed using JADE MDI 5.0 first and we discovered that the cordierite phase has \nformed and occupy the primary proportion in the sintered body while mullite and Al2O3 are left \npresumably due to non-stoichiometry mixing that excessive mullite and Al2O3 are not consumed \nduring sintering. All diffraction peaks well above the background is indexed and it is safe to say \nthat the powder raw mix which consists of at least 5 minerals has now transformed into a mixture \nof Cordierite, Alumina, Mullite and small amount of residual quartz and cristobalite. \n \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 56\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\n\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\n6000\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\nin\nte\n\nns\nity\n\n2?/o\n\nCordierite: M g\n2\n(Al\n\n4\nSi\n\n5\nO\n\n18\n)\n\nCorrundum : ? -Al\n2\nO\n\n3\n\nM ullite syn: Al\n6\nSi\n\n2\nO\n\n13\n or Al\n\n4.59\nSi\n\n1.4\nO\n\n9.7\n\n \n     Fig. 4.13: XRD phase analysis of sintered powder at1350oC for 2h \n\n \nFig. 4.14 shows one example of quantitative phase analysis by using MAUD. The method is \n\nbased on whole pattern refinement also known as Rietveld refinement. The refinement showed \nthat the weighted residual factor is around 21% and the goodness-of-fit is 2.7. The result is \nconsistent with the general guideline for QPA for mixture of complex phase required the Rwp is \naround 15% and GOF is around 2. However numerous attempts were tried in order to improve the \nfitting without success. The refinement for other XRD patterns showed similar Rwp and GOD \n(are not shown here) indicates that general error may occur in QPA interpretation. However we \nhave to bear in mind with the fact discovered in Chapter 2 that MAUD is most favourable \nsoftware in QPA in case of mixture of simple oxides. Therefore we show the QPA results that are \ngiven in Table 4.2 \n \n\n \nFig. 4.14: Rietveld analysis of bulk ceramics at 1350oC for 2h, sig=2.7 Rw=0.21 \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 57\n\n \nTable 4.2: XRD Composition of bulk ceramics  \n\nMinerals name Wt.% Vol%\nCordierite 53.6 57.43\nMullite 34.89 34.71\nCorundum  7.68 5.78 \n?-quartz 1.64 2.06 \ntheoretical density 2.69 g/cm3\n\napparent density 2.51 g/cm3\n\nrelative density 93.3% - \n \n \n4.3.2 Variable temperature XRD \n\nAs we have seen from phase diagram in Chapter 1, the ternary (MgO-SiO2-Al2O3) phase \ndiagram (Fig. 1.1) is very complex in terms of phase transition and the phase evolution with \ntemperature. Therefore, the as-supplied starting powder was studied using variable temperature \nXRD at different temperatures from 950 to 1500oC. The temperature variable XRD patterns are \nseen in Fig. 4.15. \n\n \nFig. 4.16(a) shows another example of Rietveld refinement for the sample heat treated at \n\n1250 oC, 2 h, and the quality of fit in terms sig=3.31, Rexp(%)=7.35, Rw(%)=24.39. A convention \nfor good Rietveld refinement is Rw (%)&lt;5. For complex mixtures of the phases, the Rw (%) is \nexpected to be around 15-20. In our refinement, the Rw (%) is around 24 which are higher than \nthis standard. However, it appears that further improvement is difficult to obtain since the (100) \npeak of cordierite around 10o is always underestimated. This is likely due to background \ndeveloped from glassy phase which is not easy to be accounted for in refinement. Fig. 4.16(b) \nshows Rietveld analysis of sample sintered at 1425 oC for 2 h. All other Rietveld refinements \nshowed similar quality as in Figure 4.16(a), (b) and are not shown here.

Khezrabadi et al [115] studied the formation of mullite with similar \ncomposition of starting materials and SEM studies revealed that the formation of mullite is due to \nkaolin and excessive alumina in the batch. However the content of mullite continues to increase \nwith temperature increasing, being the main phase at 1500 oC. Although mullite has better \nmechanical properties than cordierite, the sintered sample does not show such advantage. This is \ndue to the abundant liquid phase formed during high temperature sintering at 1500 oC and the \nevolving gaseous phase leading to many micro cracks within the sample. In some cases the micro \ncracks become macro cracks which are visible to naked eye and this will significantly decrease \nthe mechanical strength.  \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 60\n\n \nCorundum, ?-quartz and ?-Cristobalite are both seen decreasing as temperature goes up. At \n\n1425 oC, the other MAS oxide phases were completely reacted and monolithic cordierite (43 wt. \n%) and mullite (57 wt. %) are the only crystalline phases. Further increasing the temperature will \ncause melting of cordierite phase and mullite with highly porous structure due to cordierite \nmelting is the single crystalline phase at 1500 oC.  \n\n \n\n \nFig. 4.17: Rietveld analysis of wt. % variation versus sintering temperature \n\n \nXRD study shows that the cordierite phase is single dominant ?-cordierite. This is in \n\nagreement with the work sintered with excess MgO mole ratio [11]. Xu et al [116] studied the \ncordierite synthesis via solid state reaction without additives from a mixture of rectorite \n(Na,Ca)Al4(Si,Al)8O20(OH)4\u20222(H2O), Talc and Alumina. The sintering was conducted between \n1200-1400 oC which is similar to this investigation. Xu found that the decomposition of cordierite \ntakes place over 1350 oC and excessive liquid phase appeared and the sintered ceramics showed \nsignificant deformed shape and visible bubble formation on the surface as consequence. This \nresult is in agreement to our findings from XRD result that cordierite phase disappeared above \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 61\n\n1350 oC and the sintered sample has deformed shape and giant air bubbles across the body. \nAccording to X-ray diffraction data, Fig. 4.17, the formation of the cordierite phase seems to \nbegin only above 1150 \u00b0C. This is somewhat higher than the result reported in [117]. However, \nwe should be aware that additives such as Fe2O3, Bi2O3 and V2O5 were added, which significantly \nreduced the sintering temperature [117]. The sample consists of mullite, quartz, and magnesium \nsilicate. It was also found that raising the additives wt.% and extending the heating time led to \nhigher cordierite content, which is favorable for a higher mechanical strength and thermal \nstability of the monolith [117]. Nevertheless, the results reported by Johnson et al [111] that \ncordierite phase development started visibly at 1250oC is in good agreement with our results as \nseen in Fig. 4.17, showing the characteristics peak roundabout at 10.4o of 2?. The agreement is \nalso found well between our results in Fig. 4.17 to [111] that at 1350 oC the cordierite was the \nmajor phase. The cordierite phase fraction was found by Rietveld refinement at around 53% \nwhich is very close to reported value of 52% calculated under similar conditions [111]. In [111] \nthe study showed that upon further heating from 1350oC to 1420oC, the cordierite phase fraction \nincreased up to 90%. However the cordierite phase sintered at 1425oC does not increase but \ndecrease in our case illustrated in Fig. 4.17 and the mullite phase has continued to increase \ninstead. This is due to the deficiency of MgO. Meanwhile, the characteristics peak was reported \nto diminish at 1440oC due to melting of cordierite phase [111]. This is in agreement with sample \nheat treated at 1500oC in our XRD study. We proposed excessive MgO introduced into the \noriginal powder could attain the higher formation of cordierite. \n \n\nThe reason why the crystallization temperature of cordierite was found to be higher in our \nstudy compared to the phase diagram and other people\u2019s work [27] is likely due to the \ncompositional effects. Tsai et al [27] showed that the excess of SiO2 and Al2O3 will significant \nincrease the activation energy of ?-cordierite formation and hence the temperature. Therefore the \ncordierite phase was only seen for heat treatment above 1250 oC as SiO2 and Al2O3 were \nabundant in the original powder.  \n\n \nThe QPA result shown in Fig. 4.17 has important implications in material design in case of \n\nusing the as-supplied starting powder. The contents of cordierite and mullite have the most \nsignificant effects on the final properties and it is desirable to see that monolithic mullite and \ncordierite composite exists at 1425 oC.  \n \n\nFig. 4.18 shows the temperature/time dependent XRD phase composition of the compacted \nraw powder upon sintering under different indicated schedules. According to Montrosi et al [118] \nnot only sintering temperature but also the time play important roles in the formation of \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 62\n\ncrystalline phases. Therefore, this XRD study versus time was conducted to see temporal effects \non crystallization in Fig. 4.18.  \n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80\n\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\n6000\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\n12000\n\n14000\n\n16000\n\n18000\n\n20000\n\n22000\n\n \n\n1350oC 4h\n\n1350oC 0.5h\n\n1250oC 4h\n\n1250oC 1h\n\n1250oC 0.5h\n\n1150oC 4h\n\nO\nff\n\nse\nt I\n\nnt\nen\n\nsi\nty\n\n2theta\n\n1150oC 1h\n\ncordierite\nmullite\nspinel\n?-alumina\n?-quratz\n\n \nFig. 4.18: XRD of cordierite sintered bar at various times and temperatures  \n\n \nAt 1150 oC, a careful observation revealed the appearance of a peak around 10o from XRD \n\npattern of 4 h compared to 1 h. The peak was ascribed to indialite instead of cordierite. The \nindialite is a polymorph of synthetic cordierite compared to natural cordierite. The comparison \nbetween patterns with indialite at 1150 oC for 4 h to that without indialite at 1150 oC for 1 h is \nillustrated in detail from Fig. 4.19. This result suggests that the indialite has not been formed after \n1 h at 1150 oC, but it requires a longer time at this temperature to crystallize. Its formation could \nbe facilitated by additives that decrease the activation energy, as reported by Montrosi et al [118]. \nAnd when the temperature was further increased to 1250 oC for only 0.5 h, the crystallization \ntakes place overwhelmingly into cordierite revealed by XRD. \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 63\n\n5 1 0 1 5 2 0\n2 0 0\n\n4 0 0\n\n6 0 0\n\n8 0 0\n\n1 0 0 0\n\n1 2 0 0\n\n1 4 0 0\n\n1 6 0 0\n\n1 8 0 0\n\n2 0 0 0\n\n \n\n \n\nO\nff\n\nse\nt I\n\nnt\nen\n\nsi\nty\n\n2 th e ta\n\n 1 1 5 0 _ 4 h\n 1 1 5 0 _ 1 h\n\nin d ia lite\n\n \nFig. 4.19: XRD of cordierite sintered bar at 1150 oC for 1h and 4h \n\n \nThe spinel phase was also found from 1150 to 1250oC regardless of sintering time. However, \n\nit became invisible in the pattern of 1350 oC, 0.5 h and reappeared in pattern of 1350 oC of 8 h as \nindicated in Fig. 4.20. This suggested that further increasing the time probably does not provide \nbenefit in terms of cordierite formation from this powder of non-stoichiometry composition since \nthe cordierite phase could transform to spinel which does not provide as good \nthermal/mechanical/electrical properties as cordierite. Gonzales-Velasco et al conducted the time \nvariable XRD study on cordierite crystallization at 1400 oC and discovered that the ?-alumina \nand spinel was decreasing over increasing time and this is also supported by our data illustrated in \nFig. 4.20 as the line corresponding to ?-alumina decreases over increasing time. However, \ncontrary to that disclosed in [113], we detected spinel phase after heat treating for 8 h. The true \ncause of this peculiar finding is under investigation.  \n\n \nThe crystallization was seen to be clearly affected by the duration of heat treatment as \n\ndemonstrated also in Fig. 4.20. The amorphous background was significant after 1 h of heat \ntreatment, while the amorphous background decreased significantly upon increasing its duration. \nThis suggests that crystallinity could be improved upon longer exposure to heat treatment. But \nthis does not contradict to another route of improved crystallinity by adding nucleation agents \nsuch as TiO2. \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 64\n\n5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75\n4000\n\n5000\n\n6000\n\n7000\n\n8000\n\n9000\n\n10000\n\n11000\n\n12000\n\n13000\n\n14000\n\n15000\n\n(1\n21\n\n)\n\n(2\n20\n\n)\n(1\n\n11\n)\n\n(2\n12\n\n)\n(0\n\n01\n)\n\n(1\n20\n\n)\n\n(0\n02\n\n)\n\n(1\n12\n\n)\n\n(1\n10\n\n)\n\n(2\n02\n\n)\n\n \n\n2?\n?\n\n Heat Treatment Temperature: 1350oC(100)\n\n?-cordierite\nmullite\n?-Alumina\n\nspinel\n\n(1\n10\n\n)\n\n(2\n11\n\n)\n\n?-cristabolite (04-007-5018)\n\n \nFig. 4.20: XRD of cordierite sintered bar at 1350 oC for different lasting times \n\n \nThe properties of cordierite composite ceramics were found closely related to the fraction \n\nbetween cordierite and mullite. Therefore, we conducted a semi-quantitative estimate of fraction \nration between two phase by comparing the peak intensity from (100) of cordierite and (110) of \nmullite. The reason we chose these two peaks is that there is no other phase peak located at the \nsame position and the peak intensity is solely contributed from each phase respectively. Although \nas previously introduce, the use of peaks\u2019 intensity ratio is not the most reliable method for \nquantitative phase determinations. However, this comparison is made on the ratio of most intense \npeak between two phases existing in the same mixture, therefore it is safe to say that the ratio will \ngive a semi-qualitative description whether the phase fraction is increased or vice versa. Figure \n4.21 shows that the ratio between cordierite (100) and mullite (110) reaches maximum from \nsample sintered for 2 h. This is consistent with XRD results presented in Fig. 4.20 showing that \nfurther increase of sintering time will likely promote spinel phase instead of increasing cordierite \nphase fraction. Therefore, we determined that 2 h is an optimal time for heat treatment of the \noriginal powder. \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 65\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n7.0\n\n7.5\n\n8.0\n\n8.5\n\n9.0\n\n9.5\n\n10.0\n\n \n\n \n\nC\n(1\n\n00\n)/\n\nM\n(1\n\n10\n)\n\nHeat Treatment  time (h)\n\n C(100)/M(110)\n\n \nFig. 4.21: intensity ratio between cordierite (100) and mullite (110)  \n\n \n4.3.3 SEM study with quantitative image analysis \n\nThe SEM micrographs of ceramics sintered at 1150, 1250, 1350 and 1500 oC for 2 h are \nshown in Fig. 4.22 to Fig. 4.24 and Fig. 4.26. The morphology changes as a function of sintering \ntemperature. The mullite formation with its characteristics needle-like grains is not apparent from \nthe lower sintering temperatures. The images were taken at two magnifications of x200 for \nporosity studies with quantitative image analysis and x3000 to reveal the presence of needle \nshape mullite grains. Fig. 4.22 (a) shows that the average pore size is very small compared to \nthose at 1250 oC and 1350 oC. With increase of temperature, the average pore size increased \nsignificantly. Although no significant porosity differences could be observed between 1250 oC \nand 1350 oC, the changes in average pore size and shape (aspect ratio) are likely to affect the \nmechanical and thermal properties. \n\n \n\n  \nFig. 4.22: 1150 oC 2 h (a) porosity study;        (b)  alumina-mullite-silica microstructure \n \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 66\n\n  \nFig. 4.23: 1250 oC 2 h: (a) porosity study;      (b) mullite-cordierite composite microstructure \n \n\n  \nFig. 4.24: 1350 oC 2 h: (a) porosity study;      (b) mullite-cordierite composite microstructure \n \n\nThe mullite has needle-like grains usually from suitable heat treatment conditions, which act \nas an effective reinforcement for enhancing ceramics mechanical properties to resist fracture. \nHowever, SEM images do not show any mullite needle shape grain formation at 1150 oC.

This becomes still more evident from higher \nmagnification SEM images (x 10 K and x 20 K) as shown in Fig. 4.25 (a) and (b). The XRD \nresults of the sample heat treated at 1350 oC revealed the presence at mullite has largest fraction \nin cordierite matrix at 1350 oC and therefore the mullite formation is more visible in Fig. 4.25 \nwith somehow needle-like structure tips pointed outward and embedded in the cordierite matrix. \nFig. 4.25 (b) showed microstructure of the same area with magnification of x20 K. It is more \nclearly shown that the mullite needle shape phase start to grow and appeared out of the cordierite \nmatrix due to mullite\u2019s distinct needle-like shape. However Fig. 4.25 (b) showed only tips of the \nneedle shape mullite without knowledge of its length or aspect ratio. Therefore image analysis of \nmullite phase will not be performed since the area fraction of mullite tips cannot predict properly \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 67\n\nthe phase fraction of mullite to compare to XRD. \n \nFig. 4.22 to Fig. 4.24 also revealed a fact that the pore cells has significantly increased over \n\nincreasing sintering temperature. Although the porosity was decreasing however the pores sizes \nare increasing suggesting that the pore coalescence takes place as result of fusion of smaller pores \ninto bigger one. This is actually an indication of densification process. \n \n\n   \nFig.4.25: 1350oC (a) tips of needle-shape mullite; (b) tips of needle-shape mullite grains \n\n  \nFig. 4.26 shows two SEM pictures with different magnifications of \u2018pure\u2019 mullite (as \n\ndetected by XRD) microstructure after sintering at 1500 oC for 2 h. Needle shape mullite grains \nembedded in a glassy phase are seen in Fig. 4.26 (b). This intermingled mullite crystals tend to \nenhance crack and fracture resistance. At higher magnification in Fig. 4.26 (a) a high density of \nlarge pores is also evident, which is supposed to have derived from gas release inside a liquid \nphase. The high porosity fraction tends to significantly decrease the mechanical properties despite \nthe positive contribution of interlocking between the needle shape mullite grains.  \n\n  \nFig. 4.26: 1500 oC (a) porosity study              (b) needle-shape mullite grains \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 68\n\n \nThe SEM method associated with image processing is importance to evaluate the relative \n\ndensity of sintered specimens due to lack of monolithic phase to evaluate the 100% dense density \nas a function of heat treatment conditions, such as temperature, time and additives. The relative \ndensity is proportional to the relative volume fractions of solid and gas (porosity) phases. \nTherefore, characterizing porosity is an easily way to determine the relative density for the \ncomplex composite materials. Conventionally, semi-quantitative method is applied by drawing \nlines randomly across the images and the length between intersected points and measure the size \nof pores. The average is then calculated from a collection of such length data and the average \npore size is adopted based on the assumption that they are spherical. Nowadays, quantitative \nimage analysis has become trendy in evaluation the information from first hand data. The pore \nnormally has irregular shape and should not be approximated to a sphere. Therefore, Photoshop \ntool (magnetic lasso) is used to draw the actual shape of the pore and the pore with 2D actual \nshape is then highlighted as seen on the right hand side of Figs. 4.27 to 4.29. The 2D actual shape \nis considered as particles and the area fraction of those particles are analyzed in ImageJ. There are \nalso a few assumptions that have to be made in this investigation. Quantitative image Analysis is \nreliable and applicable to predict the area fraction of the pore structure in 2D dimensions and the \nassumption has to be made that they have a similar dimension in depth direction. In addition, we \ntook SEM images from 3 individual fracture surfaces and an average was taken to calculate the \nvolume average porosity. \n\n \nThe images were analyzed with ImageJ and one example was shown in Fig. 4.27 on the left \n\nto analyze porosity of bulk ceramics sintered at 1350oC for 2h. The structures were pre-processed \nin Photoshop and input into ImageJ for particle calculation. Similarly all other images are \nprocessed and calculated to yield the area fraction of particle and hence the relative density.  \n\n  \nFig. 4.27: (1350oC for 2h): porosity8.8%, relative density: 91.2% \n\n \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 69\n\nFrom the SEM microstructures analyzed by image processing, the calculated average relative \nporosity of the bulk ceramics sintered at 1350 oC for 2 h is 8.7%\u00b10.36%. Therefore the relative \ndensity is 91.3%.  \n \n\nThis result is subject to comparison to the XRD phase fraction study and theoretical density \nof each phase. The XRD phase analysis showed that the main phases at 1350 oC for 2 h were \n?-Cordierite+mullite+?-Alumina+?-SiO2. The theoretical densities are reported in Table 1.1. The \nXRD phase fraction is in terms of wt.% and the wt.% is converted to vol.% in order to calculate \nthe theoretical density of composite containing 52 wt.% Cordierite, 34.9 wt.% Mullite, 7.7 wt.% \na-alumina and 1.6 wt.% ?-SiO2; The volume fraction for each phase are calculated from their \nrespective density and determined as 56.7 vol.%, 35.3 vol.%, 5.9 vol.%, 2.1 vol.%, respectively. \nBased on results aforementioned, the theoretical density is calculated as 2.73 g/cm3. The \nmeasured apparent density (previous section) was ~2.52 g/cm3. Therefore, the relative density \ndetermined by the ratio between apparent and theoretical densities is 92%. The relative density \nestimated from SEM+Image analysis is 91.3%, and the result estimated from XRD and \nPyconometry measurements indicates a relative density of 92%. The agreement is excellent. \nTherefore, the combination SEM and XRD shows good potential to estimate the relative density \n(and porosity fraction) in comparison to the procedure based on dimensions and weight \nmeasurements of the specimens. \n \n\nSimilarly, SEM study was conducted to selected samples sintered at 1250 \u00baC and 1500 oC to \nsee morphology and the porosity. The semi-quantitative analysis was not applied to sample at \n1150 oC since the pores are too small to identify in ImageJ. The results are shown in Table 4.3.  \n\n \nTable 4.3: porosity determination by semi-quantitative image analysis \n\nSample  2D porosity (%) \n1500 oC (2 h) ~32.4 \n1350 oC (2 h) ~10 \n1250 oC (2 h) ~3.1* \n\n \nIn addition to the SEM and XRD studies, the true density of original powder and sintered \n\nmaterial in polycrystalline form at different conditions were studied with Pyconometry method. \nThe SEM study has proved that the bulk ceramics are not fully dense but exhibit a porous \nstructure with ~10% porosity. The pores are enclosed in the bulk sample and not accessible by the \nmeasurement media in Pyconometry method which causes significant error. Therefore \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 70\n\nPyconometry studies must be carried out using the sintered powder without closed pores. Prior to \nmeasurement, the powder after sintering was subject to hand grinding in alumina crucible with \nvigorous force for 30 mins until the powder appeared to be fine powder without visible bigger \nparticles. The examples of SEM images for the powdered sintered at 1350 oC and 1250 oC for 2 h \nare illustrated in Fig 4.28 and Fig. 4.29, respectively, suggesting that no pores remained inside the \nparticles. With this proof in hand, we are certain that the Pyconometry measurement provides the \ntrue density of the materials after sintering. It should be mentioned that the fraction of open pores \nversus closed pores are possible to be characterised by boiling water test with sample inserted into \nboiling water and measure the weight afterwards. However this was not performed yet in the \nscope of this thesis. \n\n \n\n   \nFig. 4.28: powder at 1350oC for 2h          Fig.4.29: powder at 1250oC for 2h \n\n \nThe data on density of green raw powder and sintered polycrystalline sample under different \n\nconditions are showed in Table 4.4. However, relative density is somehow difficult to get since \nthe sintered product is a composite materials containing 3 or more phases of ceramics such as \ncordierite, mullite and corundum and other phases as shown in XRD study. The SEM study also \nproved that the bulk ceramics is not fully dense composite but a porous structure with ~10% \nvolume porosity. Therefore, relative density seems to be more reliably obtainable from \nquantitative SEM image analysis associated to XRD phase analysis as demonstrated in section \n4.3.4. The graphic representation of the relative density variations under different sintering \nschedule is shown in Fig. 4.30 and it appeared 1250 oC is always more preferential to achieve \nhigher relative density whilst longer sintering time also appeared to be beneficiary to increase the \nrelative density at the same temperature. For instance, a relative density of ~98% is obtained for \nsample sintered at 1250 oC for 4h. This will be revisited with support of higher mechanical \nstrength. However, SEM study of relative density as previously introduced is planned to verify \nthe measurement by Pyconometry. \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 71\n\n \nTable 4.4: Pyconometry studies of relative densities \n\nversus sintering temperature and time \nMaterials Real density \n\ng/cm3 \nBulk density \ng/cm3 \n\nRelative \ndensity (%) \n\n3.007\u00b10.45% 1.8591 61.97* Green body \n3.007\u00b10.45% 2.095  69.86** \n\n1500 oC 2.80 2.3537 82.58 \n1350 oC \n1 h 2.539\u00b11.15% 2.379 93.70* \n2 h 2.519\u00b10.32% 2.347 91.17 \n4 h 2.55\u00b12.48% 2.373 93.04 \n8 h 2.554\u00b11.36% n/a n/a \n1250 oC    \n1 h 2.608\u00b11.15% 2.486 95.3 \n2 h 2.593\u00b10.62% 2.5057 96.63 \n4 h 2.581\u00b12.34% 2.55 98.79 \n8 h 2.581\u00b10.47% n/a n/a \n1150 oC    \n1 h 2.825\u00b11.00% 2.26 80 \n2 h 2.790\u00b11.76% 2.2675 81.27 \n4 h 2.793\u00b11.48% 2.2596 80.77 \n*: Slip cast **: PVA binder modified dry pressing \n\n \n\n1100 1150 1200 1250 1300 1350 1400 1450 1500 1550\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1.0\n\n Green body by dry pressing \n Green body by slip casting\n\n \n sintering for 1h \n sintering for 2h\n sintering for 4h\n\nre\nla\n\ntiv\ne \n\nde\nns\n\nity\n (x\n\n10\n0%\n\n)\n\nsintering temperature(oC)\n \n\nFig. 4.30: density of bulk ceramics versus sintering temperature or time \n \n4.4 Thermal properties  \n\n \nThe cordierite has excellent thermal shock resistance largely due to its extremely low thermal \n\nlinear expansion coefficient, which reduces the thermal stress generated during quenching or \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 72\n\nflame heating with temperature changing rapidly up to ?T~500-1000 K.

The thermal expansion and hence the thermal \nshock resistance will be very much dependent on the phase fraction of the aforementioned \ncomposite. \n\n \n4.4.1 Thermal Expansion  \n\nThe dilatometry studies were carried out to 4 specimens sintered at 1500, 1350, 1250, and \n1150 oC respectively for 2 h. within the temperature range from 50 oC to 1200 oC.

For #1, #2 specimens the changes start at around \n\n600oC and end at around 750-800oC; while they appear shifted to higher temperatures, ~750 oC \nfor #3, and 800 \u00baC for #4 specimens, respectively. Mirwald [12] studied the Mg-cordierite which \nis the same phase as studied in this work. He found two discontinuities in the thermal expansion \nat 275\u00b125 \u00b0C and 600\u00b150 \u00b0C, assumed to represent higher-order phase transitions [12]. The first \nslope change is related to a minimum in specific volume, implying unusual expansion behavior \n(negative thermal coefficient) at low temperatures. However, we did not find such first \ndiscontinuity as seen in Fig. 4.31. Nevertheless, an estimate of slope change at about 700-750\u00b0 C \nfor the #4 specimen sintered at 1350 oC for 2 h yields a negative TEC. Table 4.5 gives the \nsummary of the measured experimentally and the calculated values of TEC for sample at each \ntemperature for comparison purposes. \n \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 73\n\nTable 4.5: Experimental TEC versus Calculated TEC from XRD Composition \n\n11550000  ooCC  22  hh  CCoorrddiieerriittee  MMuulllliittee  CCoorruunndduumm  ??--SSiiOO22  \nCalculated \n\nTEC(10-6/K) \n\nExperimental \nTEC(10-6/K) \n(50-1000oC) \n\nTEC(10-6/K) 1.7 5.3 8.39 0.45 \nWt.% 0 100 0 0 \nVol.% 0 100 0 0 \n\n5.3 4.24 \n\n11335500  ooCC  22  hh  CCoorrddiieerriittee  MMuulllliittee  CCoorruunndduumm  ??--SSiiOO22    \nTEC(10-6/K) 1.7 5.3 8.39 0.45 \nWt.% 52 34.89 7.68 1.64 \nVol.% 57.43 34.71 5.78 2.06 \n\n3.31 3.2 \n\n11225500  ooCC  22  hh  CCoorrddiieerriittee  MMuulllliittee  CCoorruunndduumm  ??--SSiiOO22    \nTEC(10-6/K) 1.7 5.3 8.39 0.45 \nWt.% 49.57 24.59 24.36 1.529 \nVol.% 54.74 24.45 18.33 1.92 \n\n3.77 4.29 \n\n11115500  ooCC  22  hh  CCoorrddiieerriittee  MMuulllliittee  CCoorruunndduumm  ??--SSiiOO22    \nTEC(10-6/K) 1.7 5.3 8.39 0.45 \nWt.% 0 0.209 0.393 0.253 \nVol.% 0 0.252 0.359 0.387 \n\n4.52 5.786 \n\n \nThe investigations showed that, first of all, a coefficient of linear thermal expansion depends \n\non the sintering temperature. Fig. 4.32 plots the TEC variation versus sintering temperature for 2 \nh. It is found that the minimum TEC value, indicating optimized sintering schedule located at \n1350oC. This was somehow expected since cordierite fraction is the highest at 1350oC.  On the \nother hand, high TEC material of alumina reaches minimum at the same temperature. Although \nmullite fraction is higher at 1350oC but the effect of less corundum is more dominant. The effect \nof this compositional variation is reflected in reduction of TEC of the cordierite composite in Fig. \n4.33. The TEC of 3.31x10-6/K from the investigation is in some agreement with that reported by \nKehzrabadi et al [115] of 3.18x10-6/K at the same firing temperature.  \n \n\n1100 1150 1200 1250 1300 1350 1400 1450 1500 1550\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n4.5\n\n5.0\n\n5.5\n\n6.0\n\nT\nE\n\nC\n(1\n\n0-\n6 /K\n\n)\n\nTemperature(oC)\n\n Calculated\n Experimental\n\n \n \n\nFig. 4.32: TEC variation versus sintering temperature for 2h. \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 74\n\n \n\nFurther heating up to 1500 oC does not yield better TEC since the cordierite phase has \ncompletely transformed into mullite. It is possible that the TEC at 1350 oC is not the minimum \none and Johnson et al [111] showed that the TEC of cordierite could go as low as 0.74x10-6/K at \n1420oC with more than 90% phase fraction of cordierite. This helps us to further explore the TEC \nvariation versus temperature and heating time due the difference of starting materials \ncomposition.  \n\n \nGiovanni Bruno et al [119] used Neutron powder diffraction to show that the variation of \n\nlattice parameters a, b, and c of cordierite were compared to the macroscopic thermal expansion. \nIn this work the a, b axes show different thermal expansion at high temperature, but equivalent \nthermal expansion behaviour below 800oC. The TEC could be as low as 10-7 to 2.5x10-6, \ndepending on MgO molar ratio [11]. The more MgO the higher content wt. % of cordierite and \nhence, the lower was the obtained TEC. This suggested us to try to add extra wt.% of MgO in the \noriginal raw mixture powder in order to deplete mullite phase at the same sintering temperature \n1250 oC or 1350 oC for higher wt.% of cordierite in the following-up work. Xu et al studied \nthermal expansion coefficient variation from mixture of rectorite, talc and alumina without \nadditives. The mixture was similar to that used in this work and the TEC at 1350 oC was around \n3x10-6/K which is in good agreement to our result 3.2x10-6/K. The minimum TEC (~1.96x10-6/K) \nwas found at 1270 oC [116] and then increase for higher sintering temperatures. In Fig. 4.32, the \nTEC for sample sintered at 1500 oC is higher than TEC of sintered at 1350 oC, thus exhibiting the \nexpected trend discussed above [116].  \n\n \nThe reduction of TEC is one of most important factors for successful application. There are \n\nalso some reports on lowering the TEC by acid/alkali treatment which reduced the TEC from one \nthird to more than half. However, the phase composition of cordierite ceramics is often complex. \nFor instance, from XRD analysis, cordierite ceramics sintered at 1350 oC and 1250 oC contain \naround 55-60 wt. % cordierite along with 15-20 wt. % mullite and ?-corundum. Therefore, the \nTEC is not only function of cordierite but also the combination of other two phases. Interestingly, \nthe thermal properties are also tuneable with chemical treatment for instance, Bai et al [120] \nshowed that a combination of acid and alkali treatment cordierite ceramics will not only reduce \nthe TEC but also enabled maintaining the treatment effect after high temperature application.  \n \n\nThe cause for low thermal expansion is summarised by Roy et al in [14]. According to the \nauthors, there is no a single cause for the very low thermal expansion. They identified at least four \ncauses corresponding to different materials such as nano-porous materials i.e. cordierite; \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 75\n\nsilica-based glasses; ferromagnetic alloys and ferroelectric relaxors [14]. In our study, the cause \nfor cordierite is due to the cordierite has many channels and holes in the structure and the thermal \nenergy is able to be absorbed by the available holes in the structure [14].  \n \n4.4.2 Thermal shock resistance (TSR) \n\n \nTest was carried out according to the ASTM standard C1525-04 [101]. The TSR \n\nmeasurements were conducted to measure the flexural strength retained after thermal shock at \nelevated temperature. At each soaking temperature, one batch of five samples was rapidly \ntransferred from the furnace to water at Room Temperature (RT) in water tank. After the thermal \nequilibrium was reached for the sample in water bath, the samples were placed in an oven at 80 \noC for 24 h to constant mass due to likely water adsorption into the porous structure of sample \nupon quenching. The mean value of retained flexural strength from five samples per batch and \nstandard deviation were calculated. \n \n\nThe flexural strength at RT denoted ?f, Poisson ratio v, Young\u2019s modulus E and linear \nthermal expansion coefficient were determined experimentally; therefore, we could predict the \nthermal shock resistance using equation (2.16). The ?Tc was determined to be 167 K. The sample \nwas subject to flexural measurement and the retained strength was studied as function of \ntemperature difference between soaking temperatures and RT as shown in Fig. 4.33. \n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n\n100\n120\n140\n\n?T(K)\n\n \n\n \n\n 1250 2h\n\nR\net\n\nai\nne\n\nd \nfl\n\nex\nur\n\nal\n s\n\ntr\nen\n\ngt\nh(\n\nM\nPa\n\n)\n\n?T(K)\n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n0\n\n20\n40\n60\n80\n\n100\n120\n140\n160\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 1250 4h\n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n\n100\n?T(K)\n\n \n \n\n 1350 2h\n\nR\net\n\nai\nne\n\nd \nfl\n\nex\nur\n\nal\n s\n\ntr\nen\n\ngt\nh(\n\nM\nPa\n\n)\n\n?T(K)\n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 1350 4h\n\n \nFig. 4.33: Thermal shock behaviour of bulk ceramics samples with different heat treatments \n\n \nFig. 4.33 shows the thermal shock behaviour of bulk ceramics under different heat treatment \n\nschedules.

The sudden drop of retained flexural \nstrength was found occurring in ?T range of 325-625 K. At ?T=325 K, no samples showed \nsignificant decrease of retained strength and a slight increase was even measured for samples \nsintered at 1350 oC for 4 h. This is supporting evidence that all samples under all schedules \npossessing TSR properties better than ?T=325 K. This result is in good agreement to previous \nstudies conducted by Oliveira et al [15]. Nevertheless, the retained strength dropped to 1/3 or 1/4 \nof original strength when the sample experienced ?T=475 K. This is indicative of significant \ncrack growth within dense ceramic bodies. On the other hand, the suggestion to calculate TSR \nbased on equation (2) showed TSR values ranging from 200-230 K, which are significantly lower \nthan the experimental results. This was also explained in Oliveira\u2019s work that porous structure of \nbulk ceramics with around 10% porosity act as energy sink when the crack growth takes place, \nadsorbing some energy and increasing the crack resistance and hence, the thermal shock induced \nstress concentration. It is also noteworthy that the retained flexural strength for samples sintered \nat 1350 oC for 2 h is the highest retained strength at ?T=475 K. This is rather expected \nexpectation that the retained strength is higher due to the relative density of the sample or in \nanother word the porosity is higher for 1350 oC for 2h compared to others with higher relative \ndensity. \n \n For industry use, the ceramic foams experience considerable thermal stress under rapid \ntemperature changes, such as in foundry industry when high temperature molten metal flows \nthrough the foam to remove non-metallic impurity particles, or the ceramic foam filters are \nsubjected to cooling after metal filtering. Suppliers of some existing products available in the \nmarket made of Zirconia or alumina for metal casting do not provide the data on their thermal \nshock resistances. Nevertheless, ceramic foams made of cordierite have a good potential for \nthermal shock resistance applications. The TSR property was studied analytically by Gibson and \nAshby [121] who proposed an approach to evaluate this property for a cellular structure based on \nstrut's thermal shock resistance property. Then they derived the expression (4.1) for thermal shock \nbehaviour of open-cell dense ceramic foams, denoted as Rb: \n\n0.5\n\n2\n\n1\nb s\n\ns\n\nC\nR R\n\nC\n?\n?\n\n?\n? ?? ?\n\n= ? ?? ?\n? ? ? ?\n\n(4.1) \n\nRs is the thermal shock resistance of dense ceramic struts in the foam, ? is the apparent density of \nthe foam and ?s is the density of ceramic struts. The equation has two empirical coefficients C2 \nand C1, given by Gibson and Ashby for isotropic foam: C2=0.16, C1=0.5. For instance, ceramic \nfoams sintered at 1350 oC for 2 h, considering ?Tc=475 K. Using the above parameters to \ncalculate the thermal shock resistance of the 8 PPI ceramic foam gave Rb=366 K, suggesting that \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 77\n\nthis temperature difference is sufficient to generate thermal stress and cause damage by extending \nthe cracks. The experimental validation of such TSR property of ceramic foams is under \ninvestigation. Fig. 4.34 also illustrates an example of calculated thermal shock resistance of 22 \nPPI foam sintered at 1250 oC for 2 h (?Tc~400 K) based on model of Gibson and Ashby as \nfunction of relative density of foam according to (4.1). It is seen that thermal shock resistance \ndecreases rapidly when the relative density increases. However, the fracture strength and Young\u2019s \nmodulus increase in opposite way. Therefore, the design of cordierite cellular material is a \ntrade-off between the mechanical and thermal shock resistance properties.  \n\n0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45\n\n300\n\n320\n\n340\n\n360\n\n380\n\n400\n\n420\n\n \n\nT\nhe\n\nrm\nal\n\n S\nho\n\nck\n R\n\nes\nis\n\nta\nnc\n\ne \n(T\n\nSR\n)\n\napparent foam density (gm/cm3)\n \n\nFig.4.34: Thermal shock behaviour versus relative density \n \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 78\n\n4.5 Microstructural characterization of ceramics foam \n \n4.5.1 Cell cavity volume fraction  \n\n \nThe method used to study the volume fraction is very simple and straightforward. It is based \n\non the assumption that the density of the cordierite strut of the foam is the same to bulk ceramics \nbulk while the density of the cell cavity (containing air = 0.0012g/cm3) is considered to be zero \nfor simple calculation. Therefore, the fraction of the cell cavity is written in equation (4.2) below: \n\n1\ndense dense cavity cavity foam foam dense dense\n\ndense cavity foam\n\nc c c c\n\nc c c\n\n? ? ? ?+ = ?\n\n+ = =     (4.2) \n\nIn equation (4.2), the density of the bulk ceramics denoted ?dense is measured by pcnometer for \ninstance, the bulk ceramics sintered at 1350 oC for 2h has density of 2.347 g/cm3; while the \ndensity of the ceramics foam denoted ?foam is measured to be 0.403 g/cm3. Therefore, equation \n(4.1) gives the volume fraction of bulk ceramics according to (4.2) and Ccavity is determined to be \napprox 0.8283 for 8 PPI ceramics foam impregnated with suspension modified by 0.5 wt. % \nCMC. Similarly the cell cavity fraction of 22 PPI is also obtained to be 0.87 with (PS+IS)/PS \nratio ~20 at 0.2 wt. % CMC modification. The cavity fraction was not studied for 22 PPI foam \nimpregnated with 0.5 wt. % modified slurry since the foam was not successfully prepared. The \nstudy was not conducted towards 30 PPI foam since the microstructure of the polymer replica is \nnot open-cell and actually useless in real application. Fig. 4.35 and Fig. 4.36 demonstrated \nselective study of the cell cavity for 22 PPI foam with 0.2 wt. % CMC at different (PS+IS)/PS \nratio. It is noteworthy that the ceramics cellular structure has rather large discrepancy in cell \ncavity fraction in the same batch due to the processing control compared to technique of in-situ \npolymerization making of polyurethane foam. The latter is based on well defined chemical \nreaction and the cell cavity is homogeneous. In case of impregnation of ceramics slurry to \npolymer cellular structure, the impregnation is completely hand based. The ceramics slurry is not \nwell controlled to be impregnated on the polymer with exact the same amount of slurry. \nTherefore Fig. 4.35 or Fig. 4.36 showed an example of controlling microstructure by ratio \n(PS+IS)/PS. It is considered as only qualitative mean to ceramics slurry processing. This problem \nhas to be tackled by more advanced technique such as developed by Susana et al [122] with \nprototype of automated machine with multiple stage of pressing the foam to apply slurry weight \ncontrol after initial impregnation. \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 79\n\n16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32\n\n0.25\n\n0.30\n\n0.35\n\n0.40\n\n0.45\n\n apparent density(g/cm3)\n cavity volume fraction \n\npolymer strut versus suspension weight ratio\n\nA\npp\n\nar\nen\n\nt d\nen\n\nsi\nty\n\n(g\n/c\n\nm\n3 )\n\n0.82\n\n0.84\n\n0.86\n\n0.88\n\n0.90\n\nC\navity volum\n\ne fraction\n\nimpreganted with 0.2wt% CMC\n\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n \n\nce\nra\n\nm\nic\n\n fo\nam\n\n a\npp\n\nar\nen\n\nt d\nen\n\nsi\nty\n\n(g\n/c\n\nm\n3 )\n\nCMC (wt%)\n\nimpreganted suspension to \npolymer strut ratio\n\n20:1\n\n8PPI \n\n22PPI\n\n8PPI\n\nFig. 4.35 density, cell cavity fractions \nversus impregnation conditions for 22 \n\nPPI foam ;                           \n\nFig. 4.36 apparent density and cell cavity \nfractions versus impregnation conditions \n\nfor 8 PPI and 22 PPI foam.\n  \n \n4.5.2 Computed X-ray tomography study  \n\n \nThe instrument used in this investigation is an ultra high-resolution (>2\u00b5m) CT system at \n\nInstitute of National Applied Science (INSA) of University of Lyon II.

The instrument is equipped with a \npowerful workstation with 64 GB memory and multiple processors for image capture, \nreconstruction of data and Image post-processing. The data is processed and stored in form of \nstack slices and ready to be analyzed by Image Analysis software such as ImageJ [123] and \nAMIRA [124].  \n\n \nFig. 4.37: The v|tome|x ultra high-resolution CT system \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 80\n\n \nIn our work, we studied three ceramics foams with different microstructure scale. We give \n\nname to them as 8 PPI, 22 PPI and 30 PPI which originate from their polymer replica structure. \nHowever this name does not mean that the ceramics foam may share the same microstructure as \nto their mother replica since the dip casting and sintering may significantly vary the \nmicrostructure depending on the processing conditions. Fig.4.38 (a)-(c) showed the slice images \nof microstructure for 8 PPI, 22 PPI and 30 PPI ceramic foam respectively.  \n \n\n   \n(a)                          (b)                    (c) \n\n       Fig. 4.38: slice image of (a) 8 PPI, (b) 22 PPI, and (c) 30 PPI ceramic foam  \n \n\nWe notice that the ceramics strut is not fully dense, consisting in a hollow structure with \npores across the bulk ceramics body. Big and triangular shaped pores are seen from all samples. \nThe triangular shape pores are formed due to the burning-out of polymer replica during \npre-sintering at 600 oC for 1 h. The polymer burning out is not associated with the fully densified \nceramic strut but leaving a hollow structure. This is interesting since the polymer appear to escape \nfrom the ceramics suspension coated outside and the behaviour of burning out polymer seem not \ncausing the ceramics strut to collapse at 600 oC for 1 h. It is also noticed that the hollow structure \nhas shape of triangle.  \n \n\nThe 3D structure visualization is not possible for whole structure as scanned due to this \ncomputing power limitation. We compromise with cutting the scanned volume into smaller \nportion around 1/6 of its original size each. The 3D structures are illustrated in perspective view \nfrom stack of slices images as shown in Fig. 4.39 to 4.41 for 8 PPI, 22 PPI and 30 PPI foams \nrespectively. \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 81\n\n                \nFig. 4.39: 3D structure of 8 PPI ceramic \n\nfoam (42 mm x 21 mm x 19 mm)                             \nFig. 4.40: 3D structure of 22 PPI ceramic \n\nfoam (14 mm x 13 mm x 8 mm) \n \n\n \n \n\nFig. 4.41: 3D structure of 30 PPI ceramic foam (9.32 mm x 6.24 mm x 4.5 mm) \n \n\nThe 3D structure for foams of different microstructure scale shows very distinct features in \nterms of porosity and cellular structures. 8 PPI foam appear to be completely open cell structure \nwith pores interconnected with big windows and most struct materials are concentrated on edges. \nHowever, the microstructure of 22 PPI, in particular 30 PPI foam showed very poor open cell \nstructure without interconnection. In addition to this, 22 PPI foam appears to be very bulky with \nsome pores not only closed but completely filled. 30 PPI foam appeared to be uniformly coated \nwith ceramic slurry and the materials are distributed not only on edges but also on cell walls. The \nstructure of closed cell is not desirable for ceramics filter or catalyst applications. The reason of \nseeing good open cell structure for the 8 PPI foam and closed cell or bulky foam with 22 PPI and \n30 PPI foam are two-fold. First of all, the rheological properties are critical for the impregnation \nof polymer foam with the slurry. When slurry viscosity was too low, the slurry could not stay on \nthe surface and settled to the bottom. However, when viscosity was too high the slurry not only \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 82\n\ncovered the surface of the polymer struts but also blocked the windows between pores and the \ncell became closed structure or completely filled. The 3D structure of the ceramics foam of 22 \nPPI showed that the rheological properties of suspension with 0.5 wt. % CMC were suitable to \nimpregnate the 8 PPI foam but very poor for impregnating the 22 PPI foam. The aforementioned \n8 PPI foam was selected and further treated in AMIRA software to render smaller scale 3D \nstructure in Fig. 4.42 for generating grids to perform FEA calculation in order to study the \nmechanical properties as illustrated in Fig. 4.43.  \n\n \n\n          \nFigure 4.42: Partial structure of 8 PPI \n\nceramics foam                       \nFigure 4.43: grids for FEA modelling \n\n8 PPI foam (16.8 mm x 10.5 mm x 9.8 mm)\n \n\nIt is worthy noting that although the grid generation was successful, the memory required for \ncalculation was out of range of the current computing resources after testing. Therefore, the \ncalculation was actually done for a structure even smaller than that shown in Fig. 4.43. However, \na request is being made to some collaborator in order to perform such calculation using a higher \nspec PC. \n \n4.6 Mechanical characterization \n \n4.6.1 Impulse Excitation  \n\n \nThe measurement of dynamic modulus was carried out at National Laboratory of Energy and \n\nGeology (LNEG). The equipment is called Resonant Frequency&amp; Damping Analyser (RFDA) \nand the manufacturer is IMCE (Belgium). The measurement follows ASTM standard (ASTM \nE1876) and the sample is prepared with large aspect ratio to simplify the calculation of Young\u2019s \nmodulus according to ASTM E1876. A precaution should be given in measuring small length due \nto the screw calibre in the equipment could not locate the node at 0.224 L from the ends if the \nlength of sample is less than 32 mm. The typical setup of IE experiment for bulk ceramics and \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 83\n\nfoam are shown in Fig. 4.44 and Fig. 4.45 respectively. \n \n\n       \nFig.4.44: set-up for ceramics bulk            Fig.4.45: set-up for ceramics foam \n\n \nThe RFDA is also provided with software which read and analyzes the input sound signal \n\nfrom the tapping. The signal\u2019s waveform is shown on the screen and the Fourier transform is \nperformed simultaneously. The calculation of Young\u2019s modulus is carried out at the same time \nand displayed on the screen. It should be mentioned that the software also allow analysis of Shear \nmodulus by applying torsion tapping force from which the Poisson ratio is possible to be \ndetermined experimentally with relationship between Young\u2019s modulus and shear modulus. The \nresult of Young\u2019s modulus, shear modulus and Poisson ratio for the bulk \ncordierite-mullite-alumina system and foam are listed in Table 4.7. \n\n \n         Table 4.7: Young\u2019s modulus of dense and foam ceramics from IE measurement \n\nMeasurement  \nparameters \n\n1350 oC 2 h \ndense \n\n1250 oC 2 h \ndense \n\n1350 oC 2 h \n8PPI \n\n1250 oC 2 h \n22 PPI \n\nWidth (mm) 7.45 6.82 30.90 27.53 \nThickness (mm) 1.58 1.45 16.47 9.425 \nLength (mm) 53.16 49.53 130.13 80.7 \nWeight (g) 1.442 1.164 40.22 10.933 \nFlexural Freq (Hz) 3707 3815 1204 2036 \nDamping factor 0.000498 0.000566 0.007339 0.012698 \nYoung's Modulus (GPa) 96.63 94.29 0.97 1.08 \nPoisson ratio (?) 0.267 *0.267 0.004 0.014 \nShear Modulus (GPa) 38.13 - n/a 0.54 \n\n *: the Poisson ratio is considered to be the same \n \n\nThe modulus measured from the IE technique show advantages that the sample is not \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 84\n\ndestructive and the Young\u2019s modulus has also been studied by compression method at the similar \nconditions sintered at 1350 oC for 4 h. And the modulus shows much lower value of ~500 MPa \n[125]. The modulus measured by IE technique is around 1.08 GPa is twice higher than bulk \nceramics. This exotic result of disagreement is not surprised since the difficulty in machining the \nceramics specimen with an even flat surface and the machine pressing plate has also flatness \nproblem. The likely reason for this is discussed that static compression could hardly avoid the \nproblem of brittleness of the ceramics specimen that the sample will crack first before elastically \ndeformed.  \n\n \n4.6.2 Flexural strength  \n     \n\n The flexural strengths of ceramics composite of cordierite and other phases are measured \nwith three point bending method. Due to structural defect and cavity in ceramics sample, at least \n5 specimens from the same batch conditions were tested as shown in Table 4.9. Due to the \nspecimens were prepared via Slip casting route. The specimens have different dimensions due to \nhand grinding of green body. After the sintering, the sintered ceramics were checked and it was \ndiscovered that the sintered ceramics do not have good parallelism of surface. Therefore further \ngrinding and polishing are necessary to improve the uniformity of the sample size. The mean \nvalue from 5 measurements are taken average and compared to other samples.  \n\n \nThe ceramics specimens prepared at variable temperature and time were also tested by \n\nflexural strength measurement. The results are illustrated in Fig. 4.46. First of all, we note that the \nspecimen at 1500 oC, the sample of monolithic mullite does not show highest flexural strength as \nindicated by Table 1.1. It is because of the large cavity present in the body due to liquid phase \nformation. On the other hand, the ceramics decreases in flexural strength as the sintering \ntemperature decreases. The sample prepared at lower temperature (1250 oC) showed higher \nstrength around 100-120 MPa. From this trend, we proposed that the optimal sintering \ntemperature is 1250 oC without pores or crack. This is somehow proved in relative density \nmeasurement for bulk ceramics that sample sintered at 1250 oC has highest relative density of \n96-98%. Meanwhile, the longer sintering time appeared to affect the mechanical properties.  \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 85\n\n1150 1200 1250 1300 1350 1400 1450 1500\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\n120\n\n130\n\n140\n\n150\n\n \n\nFl\nex\n\nur\nal\n\n s\ntr\n\nen\ngt\n\nh(\nM\n\nPa\n)\n\nTemperature(oC)\n\n Heat treatment duration:2h\n Heat treatment duration:4h\n\n \nFig. 4.46: flexural strength at different heating temperature \n\n \n4.6.3 Compression strength of bulk \n\n \nThe Compression strength is also an important property of the ceramic cellular structure used \n\nin refractory application. The property is measured by compression and the speed of cross head is \n0.2 mm/min. Since the elastic regime of the ceramics foam is very small compared to metal or \npolymer and the compressed surface generally present a significant roughness. Therefore a layer \nof softer material called compliance layer made of rubber between the cross head and ceramics \nfoam upper surface must be used to the rough surface of the ceramics foam in order to apply force \nin more evenly manner. The layers of polymer compliance are applied at both the bottom surface \nand upper surface.  \n \n\nThe strength of cellular structure of cordierite is studied first of all for the slip cast green \nbody which is an indication of the strength for handling and cutting of the green body shape. The \nstress-strain curve is presented in Fig. 4.47. The green body shows a linear deformation with \nmultiple yield events due to crack occurrences. However, the first yield event was due to \nfalling-off piece from green body and the second yield event was related to the crack occurred \nacross the body and hence the Compression strength is determined until the second crack \nappeared. After the appearance of the second crack, the specimen was still in place but \ncompletely cracked. Therefore, the Compression strength is defined where the first crack showed \nup at ~0.15 strain as 4.17 MPa.  \n \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 86\n\n0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n \n\nst\nre\n\nss\n(M\n\nPa\n)\n\nstrain \n\nsecond crack\n\nfirst crack\n\n   \n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n \n\nst\nre\n\nss\n(M\n\nPa\n)\n\nstrain\n\n #1 disk 1350oC 2h\n #2 bar 1350oC 2h\n\n#1_E=513.4 MPa\n#2_E=812 MPa\n\nFig. 4.47: stress-strain curve for slip cast \ngreen body  \n\nFig. 4.48: Elastic property of bulk ceramics \nunder compression\n\n \nThe study of Compression strength is important for dense and cellular ceramic samples. \n\nHowever, the Compression strength of bulk ceramics is not presented due to lack of experimental \nbench that operate with adequate compressive force. Fig. 4.48 shows an example of compression \nmeasurement in which the stress-strain curve shows behaviour of multi-crack events with low \nYoung\u2019s modulus compared to those from IE measurement. These facts demonstrate that \ncompression measurement of dense sample could cause significant error and risk to damage the \nload cell with maximum force (10,000N) with big force applied (~80% of maximum force), \ntherefore the measurements for bulk ceramics was abandoned.  \n \n4.6.4 Effective modulus and strength of foam  \n\n \nThe stress-strain curves are presented in Fig. 4.49 and the linear portion of deformation is \n\nused for Young\u2019s modulus. It is noteworthy that the foam has extremely low modulus compared \nto IE measurement. The results regarding the Young\u2019s modulus from compression tests are totally \nuntrustworthy. The Compression strength was determined for a point at which the foam \ndisintegrated with a sudden structural failure as illustrated in Fig. 4.50 and Fig. 4.51. Because of \nthe problem encountered in validating the effective modulus by compression tests, therefore, the \nreliability of Compression strength is in doubt and subject to further analysis by modelling. Also \nin Fig. 4.49, the relative density of each ceramics foam are varied a lot from one to another due to \nimpregnation was carried out at different conditions such as concentration of CMC polymer. The \nmicrostructure of 22 PPI and 30 PPI impregnated with highly viscous slurry was almost closed \ncell whilst 8 PPI was homogeneous open cell structure. Therefore the modulus was seen increased \nfrom 8 PPI to 30 PPI. Likewise, the compression strength was also increased with decreasing pore \nsize of microstructure.\n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 87\n\n-0.02 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14 0.16 0.18 0.20\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n \n\nSt\nre\n\nss\n(M\n\nPa\n)\n\nStrain\n\n 30PPI (20:1), 0.5% CMC 1350oC 2h\n 22PPI (20:1), 0.5% CMC 1350oC 2h\n 8PPI  (20:1), 0.5% CMC 1350oC 2h Eeff=5.63 MPa\n\nE\neff\n\n=4.78 MPa\n\nE\neff\n\n=1.38 MPa\n\n?=0.55 MPa\n\n?=0.287 MPa\n\n?=0.078 MPa\n\nPPI increase\n\n \nFig. 4.49: example of stress-strain curve of 3 ceramics foams   \n\n \n\n    \nFig. 4.50: crush of a 30 PPI ceramic foam     Fig. 4.51: crush of a 8 PPI ceramic foam \n\n \n\n The abovementioned results suggested that characterising ceramic foam materials \nunder compression is very difficult due to its surface roughness and brittleness. The IE \ntechnique could effectively solve the problem of Young\u2019s modulus, but does no enable to \nmeasure the strength of foam. In addition, the compliant layer made of rubber is completely \ndestroyed since the fractured ceramics are very hard with sharp corners. Due to brittleness of \nceramics, the structural failure was too sudden to be accurately detected by the cross head \nforce sensor. The cross head continues to compress with increasing force and can hit the \nbottom plate and damage the machine. As consequence, further Compression strength \nmeasurements were suspended.  \n\n \n4.7 Dielectric properties  \n\n \nThe dielectric properties were measured with LCR (Inductance-Capacity-Resistance) \n\nmeter from 1000 Hz to 1 MHz. The experimental apparatus includes a ceramics tube (alumina) \nas show in Fig. 4.52 and the sample with the upper and lower surfaces partially coated with a \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 88\n\ngold layer as electrodes, as demonstrated in Fig. 4.53, was placed in the middle of the tube.  \n\n            \nFig. 4.52: Setup of dielectric measurement Fig. 4.53: disk with Au electrode, ?=5.6 mm\n\n \nThe measurement of dielectric properties was performed at room temperature for 6 \n\nsamples of different sintering schedules and also at elevated temperature up to 600oC for a \nsample selected on the basis of maximum flexural strength. No previous literature has ever \nreported on the effect of temperature on dielectric properties of cordierite ceramics and the \nceramics have to work at elevated temperature environments. Therefore, it is desirable to \nstudy the dependence of dielectric constant on temperature variations. In this regard, sample \nbatch with optimum mechanical strength was chosen (1250 oC, 2 h) to test while the others are \nunder investigation and will not be reported in the thesis. \n\n \nThe measurement of dielectric properties are based on measurement of capacitance of the \n\nceramics capacitor deposited with Au electrode on the both surfaces. The area of the \ncapacitance is the area of the deposited Au electrode and the thickness of the dielectric \nmaterial is the thickness of the ceramics capacitor as given in the Table 4.8 below.  \n\n \nTable 4.8: sample specification and heat treatment conditions \n\nHeat treatment Sample thickness (mm) \n1250 oC, 2 h 1.09 mm \n1250 oC, 4 h 1.26 mm \n1250 oC, 8 h 0.69 mm \n1350 oC, 2 h 1.68 mm \n1350 oC, 4 h 1.26 mm \n1350 oC, 8 h 0.78 mm \n\n \nThe typical equation for parallel plate and circular cross section sample is given as: \n\n2\n0\n\nr\nCd\n\nr\n?\n\n? ?\n=    (4.3) \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 89\n\nWhere the thickness d was taken into account in equation (4.3) and the capacitance C in \nmeasured in pF by LCR, r is the radius of Au electrode of 5.6 mm, ?0 is dielectric permittivity \nof vacuum (8.85x10-12 F/m). Therefore the relative dielectric constant of ceramics is calculated. \nOn the other hand, the dielectric loss factor is obtained from the ratio of the imaginary part of \ncomplex resistance ?\u2019\u2019 to the real part ?\u2019=?r. The loss factor is expressed by the following \nequation: \n\n'' 'tan /? ? ?=  (4.4) \nWhere ?\u2019\u2019 is obtained from ?\u2019\u2019=?RC, and the ? is the measuring frequency from 1000 Hz \n\nto 1 MHz. The dielectric loss factor is an important measure of quality to the sample and \nelectrode. Typically, tan? &lt;0.02 is considered very good for application. \n\n \nFig. 4.54 shows the dielectric constant as function of the frequency from 1000 Hz to 1 \n\nMHz at room temperature. The minimum dielectric constant of ceramics is around 6 at 1 MHz. \nThe result shows that the dielectric constant is slightly larger than monolithic phase of \ncordierite and equal to that of monolithic phase of mullite in Table 1.1.  \n\n \n1000 10000 100000 1000000\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n \n\n \n\ndi\nel\n\nec\ntr\n\nic\n c\n\non\nst\n\nan\nt, \n\n?\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n 1250oC 2h  1350oC 2h\n 1250oC 4h  1350oC 4h\n 1250oC 8h  1350oC 8h\n\n   \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\n6.0\n\n6.5\n\n7.0\n\n7.5\n\n8.0\n\n8.5\n\n9.0\n\n9.5\n\n10.0\n\n10.5\n\n11.0\n\n \n\ndi\nel\n\nec\ntr\n\nic\n c\n\non\nst\n\nan\nt, \n\n?\n\nheat treatment time(h)\n\n 1350oC\n 1250oC\n\n \nFig. 4.54: dielectric constant, versus \n\nfrequency at RT?                           \nFig. 4.55: sintering time dependent \n\ndielectric constant at 1 MHz \n\n \nThe dielectric constant appeared to be constant over the whole range of frequency for all \n\nsamples. This suggests that the no induced weakening or disappearance of ionic polarization \ntakes place due to increase frequency [11]. The dielectric constants for all samples at 1 MHz \nare plotted in Fig. 4.55 and the values are in agreement with previous results [11, 126]. \nHowever, there are significant differences of dielectric constant between the samples prepared \nunder different conditions. The dielectric constant shows not only sintering temperature \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 90\n\ndependence but also sintering time dependence in a rather systematic way. With increasing \nsintering time at 1350 oC, the dielectric constant at 1 MHz decreases from 8.5 to 6.0; however, \nthe sample sintering at 1250 oC for various times shows a non linear behaviour. The dielectric \nconstant starts from 8.5 and increases to around 11 and then decreases again to around 9 as \nfunction of sintering time. The complexity of dielectric properties for ceramics materials has \nbeen addressed and is dependent on many factor such as content of crystalline phase, glass \nphase, porosity and so on [127]. The larger dielectric constant is supposed to be due to larger \nvalue of mullite phase and alumina phase which will increase the composite dielectric constant \nbased on wt. % fraction of ingredient phases from XRD. On the other hand, the SEM studies \nrevealed approx 10% porosity in the 1350oC for 2 h specimen which should reduce the \ndielectric constant. However, our observation shows opposite trend to dielectric constant than \nprediction.  \n \n\nThe dielectric loss tangent is the imaginary part of complex number and the real part is \ndielectric constant as we see previously. The imaginary part is called loss factor and \nrepresented by loss tangent (ratio between loss factors to dielectric constant). The loss tangent \nis an important parameter since the electric energy will be dissipated into heat and this has \nimplication of how much the materials will convert the EM to heat. Since the loss tangent is \nalso a parameter to evaluate the microwave-materials coupling capability. The bigger loss \ntangent the better material-microwave coupling capability is, and vice versa. Fig. 4.56 \nillustrates the variation of dielectric loss factor for all samples over 1000 and 1 MHz range. \nThe curves demonstrate that the dielectric loss is relative small and consistent with literatures. \nThe lowest dielectric loss is well below 0.02 for samples sintered at 1250 oC for 8 h followed \nby 1250 oC for 2 h. In the meantime, the dielectric loss at 1 MHz showed systematic behaviour \nthe dielectric losses from samples sintered at 1350 oC are all higher than those prepared at \n1250 oC; Fig. 4.57 is dedicated to illustrate the variation of dielectric loss of all samples at 1 \nMHz. It appears that the longer sintering time tends to decrease dielectric loss factor at given \ntemperature. Therefore, the lowest dielectric loss factor is also seen from the sample sintered \nat 1250 oC for 8 h at 1 MHz.  \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 91\n\n1000 10000 100000 1000000\n-0.02\n\n0.00\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.10\n\n0.12\n\n0.14\n\n \n\n \ndi\n\nel\nec\n\ntr\nic\n\n lo\nss\n\n fa\nct\n\nor\n\nFrequency(Hz)\n\n 1250oC 2h \n 1250oC 4h\n 1250oC 8h\n 1350oC 2h\n 1350oC 4h\n 1350oC 8h\n\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n0.010\n\n0.015\n\n0.020\n\n0.025\n\n0.030\n\n0.035\n\n0.040\n\n0.045\n\n0.050\n\n0.055\n\n0.060\n \n\ndi\nel\n\nec\ntr\n\nic\n lo\n\nss\n\nheat treatment time(h)\n\n 1250oC\n 1350oC\n\n \nFig. 4.56: tan?  versus frequency at RT;       Fig. 4.57: dielectric loss at 1MHz  \n\n \nThe temperature dependent dielectric constant is shown in Fig. 4.58 from 1000 Hz to 1 \n\nMHz between RT and 600oC. The measurement was very time consuming and took 24 h to be \naccomplished with small temperature steps. Therefore, we selected the sample sintered at 1250 \noC for 2 h to study. The measurement showed a clear trend of decreasing dielectric constant \nwith increasing frequency at high temperature range while no significant differences could be \nobserved for all frequencies approximately below 200 oC. It is also noticed that the lower \nfrequency the steeper is the increase of dielectric constant above 200oC. On the other side, the \ndielectric constant at RF range of 1 MHz showed a flat dielectric constant around 10 across the \ntemperature from RT to 600oC. The sharp increase of dielectric constant for 1000 Hz to 1 \nMHz is followed by a radical drop at around 600oC. In order to determine more precisely the \ntemperature of Curie point, a close lookup of temperature dependent dielectric constant \nbetween 520 oC to 600 oC is illustrated in Fig. 4.59, indicating that all the dielectric constant \ndrops radically at 590 oC.  \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 92\n\n50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 650\n\n10\n\n100\n\n \n\ndi\nel\n\nec\ntr\n\nic\n c\n\non\nst\n\nan\nt\n\nTemperature (oC)\n\n 1000 Hz\n 10000 Hz\n 100000 Hz\n 1000000 Hz\n\nsample #1 (1250oC, 2h)\n\nf\n\n540 560 580 600\n\n10\n\n100\n\n \n\ndi\nel\n\nec\ntr\n\nic\n c\n\non\nst\n\nan\nt\n\nTemperature (oC)\n\n 1000 Hz\n 10000 Hz\n 100000 Hz\n 1000000 Hz\n\nsample #1 (1250oC, 2h)\n\nf\n\n \nFig. 4.58: Temperature dependent dielectric \n\nconstant of sample #1(1250 oC, 2 h)      \nFig. 4.59: Search for temperature to \n\nde-functionalize the ceramics \n \n\nAs previous mentioned, that the ceramics capacitor will experience such as aging after \nlong time use due to decrease of dielectric constants. The most common approach to restore \nthe ceramics capacitor or de-aging to increase the dielectric constant is based on the heat \ntreatment above the Curie temperature. However, we discovered the opposite trend in \ncomposite ceramics of cordierite. The dielectric constant of sample sintered at 1250 oC, 2 h \nshowed dramatic decrease at 590 oC. Further check was made after experiment with \nmultimeter and the cause was identified as the Au electrode has been completely evaporated \nabove 590 oC. This is rather surprisingly to us since it may imply that the dielectric constant is \nconstant over large temperature change until the electrode material is failed. The reason of \nsuch property in case of low dielectric material is extremely interesting however yet \nundiscovered. More careful investigation is under way to confirm the effectiveness of heat \ntreatment on reducing the dielectric constant and effect on other properties such as mechanical \nand so on to validate its application in real industry. \n\n \nThe following Fig. 4.60 shows the dielectric loss of the sample sintered at 1250 oC for 2 h \n\nas a function of temperature. It is apparent that the ceramics has stable dielectric loss \nresistance at 1 MHz over a wide range of temperature from RT to 600oC. The dielectric loss \nhas strong dispersion behaviour below 1 MHz. However, as previously discussed, for good \nelectronic application the dielectric loss factor has to be smaller than 0.02 and the sample \ndemonstrated dielectric loss factor not more than 0.05 until 400 oC which promises very good \ntemperature stability. \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 93\n\n0 100 200 300 400 500\n\n0.00\n\n0.25\n\n0.50\n\n0.75\n\n1.00\n\n1.25\n\n1.50\n\n1.75\n\n2.00\n\n2.25\n\n \n\ndi\nel\n\nec\ntr\n\nic\n lo\n\nss\n fa\n\nct\nor\n\nTemperature(oC)\n\n 1000 Hz\n 10000 Hz\n 100000 Hz\n 1MHz\n\n1250oC, 2h\n\n \nFig. 4.60: temperature dependent dielectric loss factor (1250 oC, 2 h) \n\n \nThe dielectric properties are closely linked to the microstructure. For instance, porous \n\nstructure is favoured since air has lowest ?~1.00005 and the presence of pores could decrease \nthe ? lower than 2. However, the porous structure is also responsible for the low mechanical \nstrength. There has been few cases of commercial grade Cordierite ceramics that has \napplication in electric isolator material and marketed in the by CeramTec North America, \nUSA.

The theory was originally \ndeveloped by Eshelby [129] who gave the expression of tensor depending on Poisson ratio of \nthe embedded phase regardless of dimension in case of spherical inclusion of embedded \nparticles or objects. The Eshelby theory was further developed by Mori and Tanaka who use \nEshelby tensor to calculate the effective stiffness of heterogeneous material. Eshelby tensor \nwas constructed as a Fourth-order tensor relating average inclusion\u2019s strain to average matrix \nstrain and could also be modified with inclusion\u2019s orientation in case of non-random \ndistribution [130]. MT method was found very successful in simulating elastic property of \nopen-cell Polyurethane foam with carbon nanotubes reinforcement under effective dispersing \nconditions in [33]. However, no literature has been ever found using MT method to ceramic \nfoams. Therefore, the MT micromechanical model for cellular materials and its application to \nthe ceramic foams is discussed in this chapter. The modelling result was compared the \nexperiment results and a poor agreement was found unfortunately. In addition, a new \ntechnique was used to simulate the mechanical behaviour by Finite Element Analysis based on \nactual 3D structure from X-ray tomography. The advantages and drawbacks from each \napproach will be discussed and reviewed. \n \n5.1 Problems\u2019 Review  \n\nAccording to Christensen [131], General Self Consistent Model (GSCM) with assumption \nof spherical cavity in a cellular material gives the most physically realistic results when the \ncavity volume fraction approaches 1. The effective Young's modulus is given in [131]: \n\n2\n2\n\n(1 )\n5 3\n\neff\n\nm m\n\nE\nc\n\nE v\n= ?\n\n+\n (5.1) \n\nWhere Eeff denotes as effective modulus of the cellular material and Em, vm are the modulus \nand Poisson ratio of strut material. In all calculations shown later on, subscripts 1 and 2 refer \nto strut material and the cell cavity respectively. Therefore c1 and c2 are the struts and cell \ncavity fractions, respectively. Here, the cell cavity fraction used in modelling is obtained from \ndensity method as introduced in Chapter 4. \n \n\nThe Poisson ratio and bulk\u2019s Young\u2019s modulus are v=0.267 and Em=99 GPa for instance \nwhen sample is sintered at 1250 oC for 2 h from Impulse Excitation experiments. The effective \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 96\n\nYoung\u2019s modulus for ceramics foam from (5.1) was calculated by taking into account of the \nfoam\u2019s cavity fraction for 8 PPI and 22 PPI as shown in Table 5.1. \n \n\nTable 5.1: effective Young\u2019s modulus from Christensen model \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \nThe Eeff is compared to Impulse Excitation (IE) measurement. The results from IE \n\nexperiment are around 1 GPa and 5 times or 4 times lower respectively for 8 PPI and 22 PPI \nfoams than those predicted by Christensen model. This study indicates a lack of exact match \nfor Young modulus. However, surprisingly good results were obtained, since such a simple \ncalculation could predict the effective mechanical properties for cellular ceramics. \nNevertheless, we also noticed a trend that when cavity fraction approaches 1, the agreement \nbetween the calculated effective modulus and experimental modulus is improved which is \nconsistent to the suggestion made by Christensen. \n \n5.2 Modeling with Mori-Tanaka Approach  \n\n \nIn order to examine the modelling ability of other method, the modelling was carried out \n\nwith approach developed by Mori &amp; Tanaka in 1970\u2019s [132] and re-developed in 1980\u2019s [133]. \nThis method gives the general expression of effective stiffness of two heterogeneous materials \nwith stiffness tensor C1ijkl and C2ijkl, the two materials occupy a volume fraction of c1 and c2 \nrespectively. Before the emergence of X-ray tomography and finite element analysis based on \nactual 3D structure, MT method was the most effective approach to study mechanical property \nof composite material with great success.  \n\n \nOne of the advantages of micromechanical method is to consider the material properties \n\nwithout request empirical parameters from experiments prior to the calculation. The general \nexpression of effective stiffness tensor of composite materials consisting of two homogeneous \nphase 1 and 2 is shown below [130]: \n\nSamples 8 PPI  \n(1350 oC, 2 h) \n\n22 PPI  \n(1250 oC, 2 h) \n\nDense modulus (GPa) 96 99 \nDense Poisson ratio 0.267 0.267 \nCavity fraction (%) 0.8283 0.87 \nCalculated Effective  \nmodulus (GPa)-GSCM 4.52 4.43 \n\nExperimental modulus (GPa) 0.97 1.08 \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 97\n\n( ){ } { } 11 2 12 1 2effijkl ijkl ijpq ijpq pqmn mnkl mnklC C c C C T c I c T ?= + ? +? ?? ?     (5.2) \nWhere Imnkl is the identity tensor, the contents of 4th order identity tensor is given by \n\nKronecker\u2019s symbol [130]. When dealing with cellular structure materials, the simple \napproach is to equate stiffness tensor C2ijpq in (5.2) to zero since phase 2 now is treated as cell \n\ncavity. Also the term in (5.2) [ ] 1mnkl mnkl mnklT I S\n?\n\n= ?  is given only in case when C2ijpq=0. \n\nTherefore a modified expression of effective stiffness tensor of cellular materials with cavity \nvolume fraction c2 is obtained: \n\n11 11 1\n2 1 2\n\neff\nijkl ijkl ijst stpq stpq pqmn pqmn pqmnC C c C I S c I c I S\n\n?? ?? ?? ? ? ?= ? ? + ?? ? ? ?? ?? ?\n   (5.3) \n\nIn addition, the General expression of stiffness tensor C1ijkl of dense matrix of isotropic \nmaterials is given as [130]: \n\n11 12 12\n\n12 11 12\n\n12 12 11\n\n44\n\n44\n\n44\n\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n\nij\n\nC C C\nC C C\nC C C\n\nC\nC\n\nC\nC\n\n? ?\n? ?\n? ?\n? ?\n\n= ? ?\n? ?\n? ?\n? ?\n? ?? ?\n\n  (5.4) \n\nThe stiffness matrix component system is also given as [130]: \n\n11 12 44\n1\n\n, ,\n1 1 2 1 1 2 2(1 )\n\nE v E v E\nC C C\n\nv v v v v\n\u00b5\n\n?\n= = = =\n\n+ ? + ? +\n   (5.5) \n\nAnd then taking into account material property parameters, for instance E=99 GPa and \nv=0.267 for bulk ceramics sintered at 1250 oC for 2 h, therefore we can determine the stiffness \nmatrix of ceramics foam with cavity shown in (5.6). Then substituting the cell volume fraction \nfound previously into (5.3), for instance, C2=0.8283, therefore we have effective stiffness as \ndemonstrated in (5.7): \n\nC1ij=\n\n122.91 44.76 44.76 0 0 0\n44.76 122.91 44.76 0 0 0\n44.76 44.76 122.91 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 39.07 0 0\n0 0 0 0 39.07 0\n0 0 0 0 0 39.07\n\n? ?\n? ?\n? ?\n? ?\n? ?\n? ?\n? ?\n? ?\n? ?? ?\n\n (5.6)   Ceffij=\n\n16.81 6.12 6.12 0 0 0\n6.12 16.81 6.12 0 0 0\n6.12 6.12 16.81 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 5.34 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5.34 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5.34\n\n? ?\n? ?\n? ?\n? ?\n? ?\n? ?\n? ?\n? ?\n? ?? ?\n\n(5.7) \n\nThe stiffness tensor of the ceramic foam was then transformed to the compliance tensor by \ninverse operation demonstrated in (5.8): \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 98\n\n11 12 12\n\n12 11 12\n\n12 12 111\n\n11 12\n\n11 12\n\n11 12\n\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n\n[ ]\n0 0 0 2( ) 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2( ) 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2( )\n\neff eff\nij ij\n\nS S S\nS S S\nS S S\n\nM C\nS S\n\nS S\nS S\n\n?\n\n? ?\n? ?\n? ?\n? ?\n\n= = ? ?\n?? ?\n\n? ??\n? ?\n\n?? ?? ?\n\n  (5.8) \n\nwhere the Elastic modulus and Poisson ratio can be determined from the components of \ncompliance tensor as given in [130]: \n\n11 12\n1\n\n; ;\nv\n\nS S\nE E\n\n= = ?

The Spqmn is known as \u201cEshelby tensor\u201d \nwhich is a function of the bulk ceramics properties as well as shape of the embedded inclusion. \nIn this investigation the embedded materials are cell cavity and considered to be sphere. The \nmechanical properties with cellular structure of foam has also to be based on assumption that \nthe ceramics strut is fully dense without crack and the mechanical strength is uniform across \nthe whole body struts. However Computed X-ray studies revealed that this is not the case and \nthe ceramics struts present a triangular hollow structure which is not be able to quantify by any \noptical or physical method since its closed structure. Nevertheless, under such assumption the \ncorresponding components of Eshelby tensor for ceramic foam with spherical cavity is found \nby Schj\u00f8dt-Thomsen et al [130]. First of all, Eshelby tensor in general form is shown in (5.10) \n[129].  \n\n1111 1122 1133 1123 1113 1112\n\n2211 2222 2233 2223 2213 2212\n\n3311 3322 3333 3323 3313 3312\n\n2311 2322 2333 2323 2313 2312\n\n1311 1322 1333 1323 1313 1312\n\n1211 1222 1233 1223 1213 1212\n\n2 2 2\n2 2 2\n2 2 2\n\nijkl\n\nS S S S S S\nS S S S S S\nS S S S S S\n\nS\nS S S S S S\nS S S S S S\nS S S S S S\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n=\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n? ?\n? ?\n? ?\n? ?\n? ??\n\n   (5.11) \n\n However, the form in (5.11) can be considerably simplified with only components S1111, \nS1122, S1212  since all other non-zero components can be related to S1111, S1122, S1212 assuming \nthe material of ceramics struts has isotropic mechanical properties. The non-zero components \nin Eshelby tensors are introduced by Mura [134]: \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 99\n\n1111 2222 3333\n\n1122 2233 3311 1133 2211 3322\n\n1212 2323 3131\n\n7 5\n,\n\n15(1 )\n5 1\n\n,\n15(1 )\n\n4 5\n15(1 )\n\nm\n\nm\n\nm\n\nm\n\nm\n\nm\n\nv\nS S S\n\nv\nv\n\nS S S S S S\nv\n\nv\nS S S\n\nv\n\n?\n= = =\n\n?\n?\n\n= = = = = =\n?\n\n?\n= = =\n\n?\n\n (5.12) \n\nThe vm is the Poisson ratio for the base materials (composite ceramics). Taking into account \nthe general form of Eshelby tensor given by Schj\u00f8dt-Thomsen [130], one can therefore \ncalculate the components of Eshelby tensor from (5.12), and substitute into equation (5.3) in \norder to perform calculation, taking into account of volume fraction of cavity in ceramics \nfoam of 8PPI c2=0.8283 and hence c1=0.1386, then (5.2) becomes: \n\n11 10.8283 0.1717 0.8283effijkl ijkl ijst stpq pqmn pqmnC C C T I T\n?\n\n? ?= ? ? ? ? + ?? ?        (5.13) \n\nWhere Tstpq=(Istpq-Sstpq)-1, therefore the effective stiffness tensor of ceramics foam of 8 PPI is \nobtained. The Young\u2019s modulus of ceramics foam can be obtained from (5.9). The modulus is \ncalculated to be 8.991 GPa. Similarly, the same procedures applied to obtain effective \nmodulus of 22 PPI foam with cavity fraction of 0.87 sintered at 1250 oC for 2 h gave the value \nof 6.86 GPa. \n \n Unfortunately, the modelling with MT method also shows poor agreement with \nexperiment. This is somehow beyond our expectation prior to the simulation as MT method \nhas proved its effectiveness in many cases that is superior to other models. The likely source \nof this discrepancy is attributed to hollow structure of ceramics struts instead of being dense \nstruts as illustrated in Fig. 4.37. The hollow structures are demonstrated by CT. The hollow \nstructure was left due to burning-out of polymer replica could considerably decrease the \nmechanical properties of cellular structure. Moreover, the struts with hollow structure are not \nconsidered in micromechanical approach with assumption that the inclusion has to be \nspherical. In addition to this, lack of knowledge of distribution of the cell size and \napproximation of cavity could also affect the result which is yet to be studied. In one word, \nMT method predicting stiffer properties of ceramic foams compared to Christensen model is \nlikely to match the experiment when the struts ceramics are completely dense instead of being \nhollow. We want to stress the aforementioned study does not suggest Christensen model is \nsuperior to MT method. For instance, when cell cavity approach to 0, meaning the material \nbecomes completely dense, hence, the simulation should give properties of dense material. In \ncase of Christensen model, the Young\u2019s modulus is 34 GPa. Instead, MT model gives 99 GPa \nwhen the C2 is 0. This proves the numerical effectiveness of MT method in simulating of all \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 100\n\nscenarios. Hence, the internal crack and defect are considered as main source of error. \n \n5.3 Tomography based Finite Element Analysis \n\n \nThe Finite Element Analysis is carried out based on the 3D structure from X-ray \n\ntomography. However, a calculation for large structure such as seen in Fig. 4.38 or Fig. 4.41 \nrequires more elements in calculation which is usually very difficult to carry out on personal \ncomputer. Therefore we chose a relative small structure but showing the same porosity~82% \nto the ceramics foam of larger scale. The structure in Fig. 5.1 is cut from the larger 3D \nstructure of original scanned volume in AMIRA software.  \n\n \nFig. 5.1: 3D reconstructed structure of 8 PPI ceramics foam by Tomography \n\n \nIn actual FEA simulation, the displacement instead of force was applied to the top surface \n\nof the structure in Fig. 5.1. The volume is set free to expand except the bottom surface is fixed \nwith zero displacement for compression condition. The materials parameters such as Young\u2019s \nmodulus and Poisson ratio are adopted from the IE measurement in Chapter 4. When the \ncellular structure is compressed downward, the stress will produced at the cell edges. The \nstress is simulated for 0.7% strain and the reaction force is calculated as resultant force from \ndisplacement.  \n \n\nOliveira et al [82] studied the modulus of the cordierite bulk ceramics and demonstrated \nE=88\u00b110 GPa. The measurement was performed using the same technique. However, the \n\nmodulus was found to be 99\u00b12 GPa in case of 1350 oC of 2 h. This was not surprising since \nbulk ceramics are not monolithic but a composite containing ~20 wt.% mullite with higher \nmodulus of 150 GPa. The composite also has ~10% porosity, therefore the composite modulus \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 101\n\nshould fall in between cordierite modulus E=70 GPa to Mullite E=150 GPa. In the meantime, \nthe Poisson ratio is measured experimentally v=0.267. One more assumption is also made that \nthe bulk cordierite is isotropic materials in terms of mechanical properties and does not exhibit \norientational properties. Therefore the modulus and Poisson ratio are taken as materials \nproperties parameter to calculate the reaction force on the structure. \n \n\nIt is well known that ceramics are very hard but brittle; therefore, it is not easy to machine \nthe ceramic foams with a perfect flat surface. Some alternative approach is used by inserting \nsoft polymer or rubber compliance layer between the compression plate and the top surface of \nthe ceramics foam. However, we did not follow this approach successfully and the ceramics \nstill crack very suddenly before it can be firmly touched and compressed. Meanwhile, the \nfractured piece of ceramics is extremely hard and tears off the polymer or rubber compliance. \nIn order to study Compression strength the stress at displacement when ceramics structure \nwith more than 50% structure fractures, we performed this study in FEM simulation. We \ncompared to flexural strength of to the batch of ceramics which is sintered and supposedly has \nthe fracture strength, ?f=92 MPa to strut of ceramic foams. This strut is supposed to break and \nhence removed in simulation when the stress of strut exceeds ?f. The elastic deformation has \nto end and further compression could only break the ceramics structure.  \n\n \nIt should be noted that stress values used in this calculation to evaluate the ceramics \n\nfracture behaviour is based on Von Mises (VM) stress. In materials science and engineering \nthe Von Mises stress is formulated in terms of the principal stress: \n\n2 2 2\n1 2 2 3 1 3( ) ( ) ( )\n\n2v\n? ? ? ? ? ?\n\n?\n? + ? + ?\n\n=  (5.14) \n\n?1, ?2, ?3 are principal stress components which are defined elsewhere [135] for further \ninterests. The significant of the VM stress lies with fact that it is used as typical criterion in \npredicting of yield point under multi-axial complex loading conditions using results at which \npoint the simple uniaxial stress (principal) results [98]. The VM stress represents the \nmaximum surface stress generated at specific location. The fracture criterion is beyond scope \nof this study and therefore we only use the VM stress to predict the material fracture behaviour \nwhen the VM stress exceeds the flexural strength measured experimentally. \n \n\nThe FEM simulation is carried out in a continuous step from zero displacement until the \nflexural strength has been exceeded certain % that created disconnection of the structure. \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 102\n\nTable 5.1 shows the steps we used in the FEM simulation for the structure of 8 PPI foam in \nFig. 5.1. Considering the variation of the compressive properties is only linear within elastic \nregime, only 3 steps are chosen to obtain linear property. \n\n \nTable 5.2: list of steps in FEM calculation \n\nSteps Displacement (mm) Strain \n1 0.0025 0.00071 \n2 0.005 0.0014 \n3 0.025 0.0071 \n\n \nFig. 5.2 (a) shows the contour plot of the VM stress and the scale of stress in terms of \n\ncolour at right top corner. We can see that the highest stress concentrated at thinnest cell edges \nand somewhere close to the cell edges. The contour plot is calibrated with 68 MPa as \nthreshold therefore the more reddish in structure the higher the Von Mises stress. However, \nunder such small strain only small portion of the structure has exceeded the flexural strength \nand supposed to fracture as shown in Fig. 5.2 (b) by removing those elements with VM stress \nhigher than 68 MPa. The 68 MPa was obtained from flexural strength measurement of bulk \nceramics prepared from the same batch of slurry for the struct of foam obtained. In Fig. 5.2 (b), \nwe conclude that the fracture of few cell edges will not likely make the whole structure fail \ncompletely.  \n \n\n          \nFig. 5.2(a): stress at strain 0.00071;  Fig. 5.2(b): fracture pattern at strain 0.00071 \n\n \nFig. 5.3(a) shows the VM stress distribution under higher strain. Now the portion with \n\nstress that has exceeded the flexural strength is much more than that in Fig. 5.2(a). Similarly \nwe also illustrate the fracture pattern in which the elements more than flexural strength is \nremoved. However, as one can see in Fig. 5.3(b), although the portion which is likely to fail \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 103\n\nhas increased but the main structure still remain intact and we will expect some fluctuation of \nthe compression force in experiment due to structure that fails. This expectation is in \nagreement with the typical static compression measurement of ceramics foam.  \n \n\n          \nFig. 5.3(a): Mises stress under strain 0.0014; Fig. 5.3(b): fracture pattern under strain 0.0014 \n \n\nIn Fig. 5.4 (a) and Fig. 5.4 (b) we show the VM stress distribution and fracture pattern \nwith a larger displacement and strain at 0.0071. Now the portion with stress more than flexural \nstrength has dramatically increased and the fracture pattern shows that more than 50 vol.% of \nstructure has completely failed and the structure is unlikely to keep stable and hence the foam \nis expected to fail catastrophically.  \n \n\n          \nFig. 5.4(a): stress at 0.007 strains;          Fig. 5.4(b): fracture pattern at strain 0.007 \n \n\nFig. 5.4 also demonstrates that in order to have elastic deformation before the structure \nfractures, one must apply at least much less than 0.007 strain to the sample in case of perfect \nspecimen geometry conditions. In our compression test, the sample has height of 5 mm, \ntherefore the deformation of the sample within the elastic regime will be less than 3.5 \u00b5m. \nThis is not easy, or is even impossible, since the sample surface has roughness which is much \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 104\n\nmore than 3.5 \u00b5m. In addition, the machine has typical step of 1~2 \u00b5m ramp and if the elastic \nregion is not more than 3.5 \u00b5m for our sample, the compression stress-strain curve will have \ntoo few points to study the modulus.  \n \n\nThe reaction force corresponding to the displacement along unidirectional Z axis is \ncalculated for each step as seen in Table 5.3. The apparent stress on the foam during \ncompression is then obtained as well as Young\u2019s modulus. In addition to this, the porosity is \nalso determined by 3D image analysis and the cavity fraction is determined for the section of \nvolume in Fig. 5.1 is around 0.8456. This porosity study is necessary to ensure that the \nstructure studied in FEM analysis is as consistent as possible to that in reality due reduced \nstructure.  \n\n      Table 5.3: calculated reaction force, apparent stress \nReaction force (N) Apparent stress (MPa) \n\n45.26 1.235 \n90.52 2.47 \n452 12.35 \n\n \nFrom Table 5.3, the Young\u2019s modulus of elastic deformation is determined as 1.729 GPa. \n\nThe experimental value of Young\u2019s modulus from IE measurement is 0.97 GPa. The \nagreement improves significantly compared to analytical model in previous section. The \nreason we found such agreement is due to the fact only tomography could render 3D actual \nstructure including all structural defects, e.g hollow structure of the struts or irregularities in \nthe modelling. In addition to the Young\u2019s modulus, the compressive strength at which the \nceramics foam will break is also investigated by FEA method which is not available in any \nother methods of analytical model. From Fig. 5.3 and Fig. 5.4, we discovered that the ceramics \ncellular structure completely failed at 0.007 strains and this is indication that the compressive \nstrength must be below the stress applied at strain of 0.007. The stress was calculated by FEA \nat such strain as 2.47 MPa. The result from compression study in Chapter 5 suggested that the \ncompressive strength of 8 PPI foam was 0.078 MPa. It is speculated that although the \nagreement between FEA result and experiment was large, however, the main error should \ncome from the compression test due to irregularity of the sample dimension. The compressive \nstrength should increase in case of perfect machining of the compressed surface. Therefore \nFEA study provided an potential mean to evaluate the compressive strength of the cellular \nstructure, which is otherwise unpredictable in particular in case of brittle material.  \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 105\n\n \nIn abovementioned case, the FEA modelling was only applied to the case of 8 PPI foam \n\ndue to the model is only available for this case. We have not conducted yet FEA modelling to \nfoams of 22 PPI produced with different processing specifications. However, the study \ndemonstrated best agreement up to date and effectiveness of CT-FEA modelling and further \ncollaboration with X-ray tomography lab is being sought. \n \n5.4 Conclusive marks and future works \n\n \nBulk ceramics and ceramics foam made of cordierite and mullite as well as corundum or \n\nquartz are produced and characterized with compositional, microstructural and \nthermo-mechanical properties. Bulk ceramics showed a Young\u2019s modulus around 96-99 GPa \nand flexural strength at room temperature between 90-120 MPa. The composition of starting \nmaterials was revealed by XRD containing talc, corundum, quartz, feldspar and kaolinite as \nprimary phase. The sintered product at variable temperature by XRD show maximum relative \nwt.% of cordierite at 1250 oC and further increasing the temperature for the same time of heat \ntreatment is not effective in increasing the cordierite phase perhaps due to the Mg-containing \ncompounds has depleted. The temperature XRD study also reveals that the formation of \ncordierite only takes place above 1250 \u00baC until the cordierite melt at 1460 oC. Sample sintered \nat 1425 oC showed dual phase of cordierite and mullite. The mechanical, thermal and \ndielectric properties are supposed to be optimized; however, an investigation is under way to \nverify this. \n\n \nMullite is found continuously increasing from the batch of raw powder upon heated from \n\n950 oC. Above 1350 oC up to 1425 oC the cordierite wt.% fraction does not further increase \nwhen temperature rises due to Mg-deficiency however the SiO2-Al2O3 continue to form \nmullite wit increasing wt.% and will transform to mullite completely at 1500 oC while \ncordierite has melt around 1460 oC. However the mullite specimen is macro-porous with \nvisible crack and pores. This is due to liquid phase formation when cordierite melts and leave \nbubble entrapped inside the body after sintering. The mechanical strength was decreased \nsignificantly despite mullite has superior mechanical properties over cordierite in terms of \nbulk ceramics. \n\n \nFrom the same batch of raw materials, it is found that not only sintering temperature but \n\nalso the lasting time of sintering play critical role. For instance, at 1150 oC the powder sintered \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 106\n\nfor 2 h showed no sign of cordierite, but the same batch sintered for 4 h showed formation of \ncordierite low temperature polymorph, indialite. At 1350 oC, the batch sintered for 2 h showed \nonly cordierite and XRD revealed that when the powder was sintered for 8 h, the \ntransformation took place from cordierite to some spinel. However, the composition variation \neffect to mechanical or physical properties has not been investigated yet. But it is unlikely to \naffect the mechanical properties in a significant way as much as sintering temperature. \n\n \nThe thermal expansion studies suggest that 1350 oC is the optimal temperature in current \n\ninvestigation to give lowest TEC from the batch of original materials. However, further \nstudies should be carried out between 1350 oC up to cordierite melting point 1460 oC. Also the \ntime of heat treatment effect on the thermal properties should be also examined to support to \ninvalidate the XRD result with variable time. It is expected that longer heat treatment will \nbenefit the cordierite formation and depleted higher TEC materials such as Alumina.  \n\n \nSEM studies suggest that the porosity of bulk ceramics is around 10%. This result is \n\ncompared to relative density by Pyconometry measurement and XRD composition study \nwhich determine the phase volume fractions of each constituents and hence the density of \ncomposite ceramics. The agreement was found well. The composite showed a TEC which is \ndifferent from that of each ingredient materials, therefore the volume fraction of each \ningredient is also used to model the TEC. Experiments pointed out that the ceramics bulk \nsintered at 1350oC for 2h has good agreement with around 10% of porosity.  \n\n \nThe lower TEC ensures very good thermal shock resistance (TSR) properties due to less \n\nthermal strain and hence stress generated in rapid heating or cooling. The cordierite composite \nwith variable composition of mullite and alumina and SiO2 are characterized by water quench \nmethod in line with ASTM standard. The experimental TSR is much higher than prediction \nand this is likely due to the porosity which acts as energy sink when the structure thermally \nexpands. Further work is expected to perform in using FEA with thermal properties to \nsimulate the thermal stress during rapid cooling to establish the scenario of thermal shock test. \n\n \nCordierite ceramics are potential materials in low-k and low current leakage applications \n\nin the IC industry. Therefore, dielectric properties measurement was carried out. The dielectric \nconstant was found low within wide frequency range and around 7 at 1 MHz. The dielectric \nloss factor appears to be low as well. Therefore, the high modulus, relative high strength and \ngood thermal shock resistance cordierite composite ceramics with abovementioned dielectric \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 107\n\nproperties is promising for electronic packaging industry.   \n \n\nMori-Tanaka method was applied first to model the experiment for ceramics foam with \naveraging the cell morphology. Since the pores embedded in bulk ceramics are not considered \nequivalent to a sphere. Nevertheless, the effective modulus property is evaluated under \nassumption of spherical inclusion. The modelling shows a rough agreement. In the meantime, \nthe modelling is based on 3D actual structure from CT experiment. This is supported with the \nfact that the strut of cellular structure is hollow which is different from other cellular materials \nthat fully dense strut was found. The 3D actual structure was subject to FEA modelling in \nAbaqus/CAE and the best agreement between modelling and experiment is found for samples \nwith 8 PPI pore size. This was an expected result since only CT rendered structure could take \nfully account of the defect and crack which affect the overall property of mechanical response. \nThis CT-FEA modelling proves its usefulness in modelling material micromechanical \nbehaviour under complex loading. Upon a full search of web of science, to the best our \nknowledge there is no such method or research has ever been conducted to ceramics foam yet. \nOn the other hand, ceramics foam has become more and more popular product in today\u2019s \nacademics and commercial market required urgent and more advanced characterization. \n\n \nThe future work is recommended in the following categories: \n1) Improve the homogeneity of the foam by using suspension with smaller particle \n\nmean size and distribution. The suspension\u2019s viscosity should be further optimized \nwith thickening agent and weight ratio between impregnated suspensions to \npolymer struts should be more closely controlled. Therefore, the shrinkage and \ndeformation during drying and sintering could be reduced to minimum.  \n\n2) Extra efforts should be made to consider adding sintering additives to increase the \ndensification, perhaps P2O5 or excessive MgO in order to obtain single phase of \ncordierite at lower temperature. From Rietveld refinement it appears that \nMg-containing oxides have been depleted while corundum is still abundant. This is \nperhaps why the mullite is formed instead of cordierite between 1250-1350 oC. \nWork should be done with variable wt.% MgO or P2O5 added to the starting \npowder to see if the sintering temperature and cordierite fraction can be optimized \nand the properties-compositional relationship should be revisited. \n\n3) The dielectric measurement is performed and the result was assuring its potential \napplication. The dielectric constant show very low constant (7-10) depending on \nsintering schedule. Bearing that in mind the cordierite ceramics are supposed to be \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 108\n\nused as low-dielectric loss materials. Therefore, further work should be also \nconsidered to increase the fraction of cordierite in the composite. In the meantime, \nthe ceramic components could work at elevated temperature environment. The \ntemperature-dependent dielectric properties of one representative samples were \nalso characterized and analyzed. Study suggests the cordierite ceramics prepared \nfrom this non-standard powder has comparable or superior properties than \ncommercial grade product and therefore continued efforts should be given.  \n\n4) The brittleness of bulk and cellular ceramics is one of most main disadvantages to \nlimit the application of cordierite especially ceramics foam made of cordierite. \nCNTs are considered unlikely in oxygen-based ceramics for reinforcing agent due \nto thermal instability during sintering. However, a few works have shown a \npossibility of using Spark Plasma Sintering in reduced atmosphere to incorporate \nCNTs in alumina. Hence it is interesting to apply this technique in cordierite. \nContinuing efforts in searching technique to disperse and sintering cordierite with \nCNTs should be supported with encouragement of some researches that \ndemonstrated successful reinforcement of mullite with CNTs reinforcement should \nbe given attention in this regard. \n\n5) A series of ceramic cellular materials made of e.g. ZrO, Alumina, SiC are \ndeveloped for metal casting and catalyst converters. However, the cost of \nproducing and applying such ceramic foams is high. The study above showed that \ncordierite-mullite composite has no advantageous properties compared to those \nceramics aforementioned, i.e. the composite has flexural strength from 90~120 \nMPa whilst SiC has flexural strength of 500-1080 MPa. The Compression strength \nof cordierite foam is around 1-2 MPa and flexural strength of ceramics foam made \nof composite cordierite in this investigation while the SiC foam demonstrated \nCompression strength of 8-50 MPa and flexural strength of 3-30 MPa. However \nlow cost of cordierite ceramics is attractive and therefore efforts should be \ncontinued to find the most optimized route. In addition, the material is supposed to \nbe applied in thermo-mechanical engineering. The mechanical behaviour of \ncordierite at high temperature is expected to be visited.  \n\n6) Finally, FEM modelling should be considered by taking into account of thermal \nexpansion coefficient which enables thermo-mechanical modelling of stress \ngenerated during quenching experiment. The modelling could be used to compare \nthe experiment to simulate the defect dependent thermal shock resistance \nproperties. \n\n\n\nEMMS-European Master Materials Science 2008/2010                                                   \n\n 109\n\n \nReferences \n1.
