The soft-\n\nhttps://git.io/vMjma\n\n\n16 Chapter 1. Introduction\n\nware was written in Python, a high-level, cross-platform programming language and the\n\nGUI was designed with wxPython. Numeric operations were performed with the Numpy\n\nmodule and all graphic capabilities were provided by the Matplolib library.\n\nThe original version had data input with simple ASCII text files, with values of dip\n\ndirection/trend and dip/plunge separated by spaces, tabs or commas, supporting planes\n\nin direction notation using the Right Hand Rule. Multiple files can be opened at the same\n\ntime (or the same file more than once), and different elements of each dataset (poles, great\n\ncircles etc) can be overlaid. The GUI shows the opened files in a tree structure, similar\n\nto \u201clayers\u201d of many illustration software, where the vertical order of the files in the tree\n\nreflects the drawing order of the selected elements (Fig. 1.1). At that stage, the software\n\nperformed plotting operations of poles to planes, lineations, great circles, density contours\n\nand rose diagrams. A set of statistics was calculated for each file and its eigenvalues and\n\neigenvectors were used to suggest if the data is clustered about a mean value or distributed\n\nalong a girdle. Modified Flinn, Triangular and histograms plots were also available.\n\nFigure 1.1: Image of the main window on the Stereonet tab, showing a contoured dataset.\n\nOver the years OpenStereo have acquire a great number of users, being cited in several\n\n\n\nSec?a?o 1.3. Objectives 17\n\narticles such as the most recent Gehrmann et al. (2016),Moreno-Sa?nchez et al. (2016) and\n\nPhillips et al. (2016). Even back in its first release, the authors predicted a development\n\nthat would focus on building additional tools such as merging and rotation of datasets,\n\npossibility to save projects and paleostress analysis.\n\nUnfortunately, the original graphical interface toolkit used, WxPython, ceased to be\n\ndeveloped. Also, while the original code was made to be extensible, it had some structural\n\nelements that would make deep changes difficult. As such, a complete rewrite was needed.\n\n1.3 Objectives\n\nThis work pursued several objectives. The foremost and key to the others was the\n\nrebuilding of OpenStereo. This would happen in two steps, first the building of a direc-\n\ntional data analysis library, Auttitude, which would be responsible for data loading, pre-\n\nprocessing and numerical analysis, and second OpenStereo itself, restructured as mainly\n\nan interface for Auttitude, focusing on data objects management and user interaction.\n\nThis separation of concerns was a strong requirement for the project, to allow it to be\n\nmore extensible and easily maintainable, while also preventing at least some of the damage\n\nwhere the new graphical toolkit used also cease to be maintained and developed.\n\nA second objective was the building and adaptation of new tools to OpenStereo, such\n\nas small circles fitting, project management, projection rotation, new methods to calculate\n\ncontours and rose diagrams, among others.\n\n\n\n18 Chapter 1. Introduction\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nMethods\n\nDuring the restructuring OpenStereo was effectively divided in three parts: a data\n\nmodel and processing system, an abstraction layer and a graphical interface. The purpose\n\nof this division was to make each part as independent as possible, allowing for almost\n\nseparate development and strongly simplifying management.\n\nThe first part, the data model and processing system, came to be a full fledged direc-\n\ntional data analysis library, Auttitude. Though mainly built for OpenStereo, it is generic,\n\nand may both be used on its own on a Python interactive shell or used to build other\n\nsoftware. It contains functions to load datasets, translate notation and classes to store\n\ndirectional data, related statistics and counting grids. It was developed using the Python\n\nstandard library, Numpy (Oliphant, 2006) and xlrd (Python Software Foundation, 2016).\n\nBoth the abstraction layer and graphical interface reside in OpenStereo. The graphical\n\ntoolkit used was Qt, through the pyside library (https://wiki.qt.io/PySide). The main\n\nwindow and dialogs were created in Qt Designer, and compiled to Python using the pyside-\n\nuic routine, part of the pyside library.\n\nThe abstraction layer was then responsible for connecting the Auttitude Directional-\n\nData objects to the graphical interface, handling calls to the Matplotlib plotting library\n\n(Hunter, 2007), storing plot settings, populating and parsing the properties dialogs and\n\nbuilding programmatically the graphical interface elements that couldn\u2019t be created on Qt\n\nDesigner.\n\nTo accomplish these tasks it heavily relies on reflection, which is the ability of a com-\n\nputer program to examine, introspect and modify its own structure at runtime. The items\n\nthat represent loaded data on the layer tree on OpenStereo are derived from an abstract\n\nclass called DataItem. When a DataItem derived object is created, it introspects and find\n\nhttps://wiki.qt.io/PySide\n\n\n20 Chapter 2. Methods\n\nall its methods whose name starts with \u201dplot \u201d, creating a checkbox as a subitem using\n\nthe remaining of its name as the checkbox label.\n\nWhen the plot method of the main window is called, either meaning that the plot\n\nbutton was clicked or some other method called it directly, the abstraction layer searches\n\nfor all instantiated DataItems that are checked and asks for their plot elements. In turn,\n\neach DataItem search itself for its subitems that are checked and calls their respective\n\n\u201dplot \u201d methods, which will return plot elements that will be dispatched to one of the\n\npanels.\n\nIn concrete terms, this means that derived classes such as PlanarData can be consid-\n\nerably simple, only concerning itself with providing methods that will return the needed\n\ndata and plot parameters, as color and symbol. It will then be possible to focus future\n\ndevelopments on numerical problems, as for example paleotension calculation for faults, as\n\nthe graphical interface will effectively build itself and connect the data to the plots.\n\nThe properties dialogs for the data types are connected in a similar but simpler way. By\n\nfollowing a naming convention for the widgets assembled on Qt Designer the abstraction\n\nlayer is able to find where in the DataItem object should the related property be retrieved\n\nand stored.\n\nThree main additional tools were included in OpenStereo, ply2atti, which is a routine\n\nto extract attitudes from three-dimensional models (Viana et al., 2016), a shapefile to\n\ncircular data conversion tool and a Small Circles Fitting method. Ply2atti uses numpy\n\nand NetworkX (Hagberg et al., 2008) to read and extract information from the models,\n\nwhile the shapefile tool uses the pyshp library (Ian Bicking and Michael Foord, 2005) to\n\nparse shapefiles. The Small Circles Fitting method uses Numpy for vectors and linear\n\nalgebra.\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nAUTTITUDE: Object Oriented Computational Model\n\nfor Directional Data\n\n\n\nAUTTITUDE: object oriented computational model for\ndirectional data with emphasis on tectonics and\n\nstructural geology\n\nArthur Endleina,?, Ginaldo Ademar da Cruz Campanhaa, Camila Duelis\nVianaa, Carlos Henrique Grohmannb\n\naInstitute of Geosciences, University of Sa?o Paulo, Sa?o Paulo, 05508-080, Brazil\nbInstitute of Energy and Environment, University of Sa?o Paulo, Sa?o Paulo, 05508-010,\n\nBrazil\n\nAbstract\n\nDirectional data (that is, data that may be represented as unit vectors) have\n\nmany different uses in the geological sciences, either, for example, on structural\n\ngeology, representing the attitudes of planar or linear structures or in sedimen-\n\ntology, used for paleocurrent direction analysis.

Introduction\n\nDirectional data are those that can be represented as unit vectors, typically\n\nin two or three dimensions, representing points on a spherical surface (3D) or a\n\ncircle (2D), line orientations or rotations. They are also referred as orientation,\n\nangular or spherical data, and can be vectors, if they have direction and sense,5\n\nor axial, if they have only direction (Fisher et al., 1987; Jupp and Mardia, 1989).\n\nThere are multiple examples of their application within geology: on crys-\n\ntallography, representing the relative orientation of crystal faces; on structural\n\ngeology, representing the orientation of planar and linear structures; on paleo-\n\nmagnetism, as remaining magnetization poles; and on Tectonics, both on plate10\n\ntectonic kinematics, representing hot spot traces, and transform faults.\n\nTheir representation in Geology is usually made in projections for three-\n\ndimensional data (Equal-Area and Equal-Angle mostly, ortographic and gnomonic\n\nrarely), or as rose or kite diagrams for two-dimensional data. Also, distributions\n\nand numerical statistical methods have been known for quite some time and are15\n\navailable in most software for the treatment of structural orientation data. The\n\nrepresentation of these data in the form of vectors allows for greater clarity and\n\nease of operation, facilitating their manipulation in software.\n\nThe main goal of this work was the production of an easy to use and ex-\n\ntensible object-oriented directional data analysis library, with emphasis on geo-20\n\ntectonics and structural geology data processing. The main use of the library\n\nwas in the remodeling of OpenStereo, as its numerical engine, but it can also\n\nbe used directly in a interactive Python shell.\n\n2. Directional data analysis\n\nStatistical analysis of directional data in geology can be traced to Schmidt25\n\n(1917), while studying structures in slates, developing both the use of the rose\n\ndiagram and the normal distribution enveloped in the circle. Most of the ad-\n\nvances in circular data processing at the time occurred in geology, with the\n\nnotable exception of von Mises (1918), who applied it in error modeling in the\n\n23\n\n\n\ndetermination of atomic weights, developing the statistical distribution that30\n\nbears his name, and that is still the most used in this type of data (Fisher,\n\n1993).\n\nThree-dimensional directional data statistical analysis was started by Fisher\n\n(1953), when defining a distribution for vectors concentrating around an aver-\n\nage vector equivalent to the normal distribution, developed to treat paleomag-35\n\nnetism data. Known as Fisher distribution, it was latter joined by a number\n\nof other distributions on the sphere, such as Watson (Bingham, 1964; Watson,\n\n1965), for the concentration of axial data around a mode or in great circles,\n\nBingham-Mardia (Mardia and Gadsden, 1977; Bingham and Mardia, 1978), for\n\nconcentrations in small circle girdles and the generic distributions of Bingham40\n\nfor axial data (Bingham, 1964, 1974) and Kent for vector data (Kent, 1982),\n\nthat can describe a number of possible distribution shapes depending on their\n\nparameters.\n\nIn addition to these more formal statistical distributions and their associated\n\nparameters, a number of other ad-hoc numerical methods have been created,45\n\nmany of which are very useful for the analysis of geological data. Kamb (1959) is\n\nan example, defining criteria for detecting uniformity deviation in count meshes,\n\nlater revisited and expanded by Robin and Jowett (1986). In addition, Wood-\n\ncock (1977) and later Vollmer (1990) developed methods to classify the general\n\ndata form from the eigenvalues of their orientation matrix, serving as an initial50\n\nnon-parametric basis for data treatment. Circular data are generally represented\n\nin the form of rose or kite diagrams built as circular histograms, binning the data\n\nin sectors around the circle. However, some studies (e.g. Fisher (1993), Munro\n\nand Blenkinsop (2012)) propose a continuous curve based on moving averages,\n\nsimilar to the methods applied on spherical data with counting meshes.55\n\n2.1. Attitude notation\n\nIn geology there is a great variety of methods for recording measured atti-\n\ntudes, specially for planar data. This is an additional obstacle to the numerical\n\ntreatment of this type of data, as its manual conversion is generally necessary.\n\n24\n\n\n\nWith careful parsing, though, it is possible to read and analyze most of these60\n\ndifferent notations.\n\nThe attitude of a typical planar layer is recorded as a horizontal orientation\n\nand a vertical inclination, the first as a direction or a dip direction and the\n\nsecond as a dip. Using dip direction notation is usually unambiguous, whereas\n\nusing direction has the problem that it may mean either of two opposite dipping65\n\nplanes. To solve that, either additional information on to which quadrant does\n\nthe layer dips to should be appended to the data, usually after the dip angle,\n\nor a convention has to be used as to which direction to record, such as the\n\nright-hand rule that states that the recorded direction should always be the one\n\nthat is 90 degrees counter-clockwise to the dip direction.70\n\nThese horizontal orientations can be either presented as an azimuth, ranging\n\nfrom 0 to 360 (or 0 to 180, or 270 to 90, for directions), or as a quadrant,\n\nranging from N0E to N90E or N0W to N90W or S0E to S90E or S0W to S90W,\n\ndepending on the quadrant it is in and whether direction or dip direction is\n\nused. Measurements are sometimes recorded in unusual ways, such as direction75\n\nmeasures counted from the south, either as a particular method of the geologist\n\nwho collected the data or simply by inexperience, or approximate measures such\n\nas NS or EW, or only N, S, E or W.\n\nIt is not possible in general to determine whether a particular measurement\n\nwas taken using direction or dip direction, but from this basic information the80\n\nrest can be converted without great difficulties by software. The following reg-\n\nular expressions are the basis of this analysis:\n\n([NSEW ]{0, 2})(\\d?)([NSEW ]{0, 2}) (1)\n\n(\\d+)([NSEW ]{0, 2}) (2)\n\nRegular expressions (Kleene, 1951; Pilgrim, 2009) are a method to validate\n\nand analyze texts in a robust and fast way, allowing to define which variations\n\nare acceptable and extracting specific pieces of the analyzed text. In the above85\n\n25\n\n\n\ncases each parenthesis indicates one of the analyzed pieces, being for Eq. 1,\n\n([NSEW] {0, 2}) the first letter of the azimuth, which must be one of N, S, E\nand W, NE, NW, SE, SW or empty; (\\d?), the azimuth itself, which must be\na number or empty; ([NSEW] {0, 2}), the second letter of the azimuth, which\nmust also be one between N, S, E and W, NE, NW, SE, SW, or empty; and for90\n\nEq. 2, (\\ d +), the dip, which must be a number; and [NSEW] {0, 2}), the dip\nquadrant, which must be one of N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW, or empty.\n\nFrom the presence (some value) or absence (empty) of each of these parts\n\n(except for the separator and the dip value) the truth table Tab. 1) shows\n\nacceptable patterns for attitude data, omitted cases being considered errors.95\n\nFrom this information and the fact that it is a direction or dip direction,\n\nit becomes possible to convert these attitudes to a single format, which is then\n\nused for the rest of the analysis. AUTTITUDE uses dip direction / dip notation\n\nas this single format.\n\n2.2. Vectors and algebra100\n\nAlthough most operations between directional data can be done by other\n\nnon-vector methods (e.g. graphical methods such as projections or numerical\n\nones through flat or spherical trigonometry), it is difficult to outgrow vectors in\n\nterms of syntax clarity and ease of programming. Vectors are sets of numbers,\n\none for each dimension represented, sorted as a single row or column. They are105\n\na special case of matrices, which have m rows by n columns (Fergusson 1994).\n\nTo represent directional data as vectors it is necessary to convert the entry\n\nattitudes (or coordinates, or angles in general) to directional cosines, which are\n\nnumerically the cosine of the angle between the attitude and x, y and z axes\n\n(typically North, East and upwards, for geological attitudes).110\n\nConsidering a lineation as an example, We first divide the vector resulting\n\nfrom the attitude into its vertical and horizontal components (Kim, 2005). As\n\nthe plunge is the angle between the line and the horizontal plane, its vertical\n\ncomponent will be the sine of this angle, leaving its cosine as its horizontal\n\ncomponent. Since the trend is the angle between the North (X) axis and the115\n\n26\n\n\n\nhorizontal component of the vector, this will be further divided between the\n\ncosine of the trend angle for the X axis and the sine of the plunge for the Y\n\naxis. In short, the following formula holds:\n\nu =\n\n?\n????\n\nsin(trend) cos(plunge)\n\ncos(trend) cos(plunge)\n\n?sin(plunge)\n\n?\n???? (3)\n\nAn equivalent formula for plane attitudes is constructed in a similar way\n\nusing the plane normal vector as its vector representation.120\n\nThe inverse conversion, from direction cosines to attitudes, is typically made\n\ncalculating the arcsin (or arccos for planes) of the vertical component and the\n\narctan of the ratio between y and x components (or x and y for planes), and\n\ncomparing the signs to determine the trend quadrant.\n\nDirection cosines of circular data have a much simpler construction, as their125\n\nx component will just be the cosine of the azimuth and the y component its\n\nsine, and the inverse conversion is the same as for the horizontal components of\n\nline data. For axial directional data it is recommended (Fisher, 1993) to double\n\nthe azimuth before the calculation of direction cosines and then dividing the\n\nresult by two when performing the inverse conversion, to distribute the vectors130\n\nalong the whole circle and avoid problems such as described in Section 2.3 for\n\naxial spherical data.\n\n2.3. Descriptive statistics\n\nThese direction cosines can then be used to obtain some descriptive statis-\n\ntics for spherical directional data (Fisher et al., 1987). Being xi = {xi,yi,zi}135\nthe direction cosine of each data point, the resulting vector and its length are\n\ncalculated as,\n\nr =\n?\n\nxi, x? =\nr\n\nn\n, R = |r|, R? = R\n\nn\n(4)\n\nThe resulting vector r gives a general sense of the direction of points. The\n\naverage length R? will be closer to 1 as the more concentrated the points are\n\n27\n\n\n\naround the resulting vector.140\n\nFor directional data, average lengths close to zero may either mean that\n\nthe vectors have no preferred orientation or that they are clustered around two\n\nopposing direction with a similar density of points.\n\nAs for axial data, it may also mean that the points have no preferred orien-\n\ntation, but it could be an artifact of the vector representation. Points that are145\n\nhighly concentrated around a direction that is nearly horizontal will be repre-\n\nsented as vectors on opposing sides of the sphere, resembling a situation similar\n\nto the second one for directional data.\n\nA reasonably simple correction is to compare the data points with the first\n\neigenvector of their dispersion matrix (Section 2.4), which will also be close to150\n\ntheir mean direction but will not be affected by this phenomenon, as the calcu-\n\nlation of the dispersion matrix is insensitive to inversion of points. From this,\n\nit is possible to concentrate the vectors in a single hemisphere relative to this\n\neigenvector, avoiding some problems with the calculation of these parameters\n\nand other treatments. This method is particularly useful for simple concentra-155\n\ntions of points, but may not be adequate for data around small circle girdles\n\nwith large semi-apical angles.\n\nThe same statistics can be calculated for circular data, being also possible to\n\ndefine the circular variance V and circular standard deviation v (Fisher, 1993)\n\nas:160\n\nV = 1 ?R, v =\n?\n\n2 log(1 ?V ) (5)\n\n2.4. Eigen analysis and shape parameters\n\nThese basic parameters of dispersion around the mean are then comple-\n\nmented by the shape parameters, extracted from the dispersion matrix T (also\n\ncalled the orientation matrix), defined as follows:\n\nT =\n1\n\nn\n\n?\nxTi \u00b7xi (6)\n\n28\n\n\n\nThe eigenvectors (ui) and eigenvalues (?i) of this matrix represent the axes165\n\nand respective lengths of the data best fit ellipsoid (Pearson, 1901). Considering\n\nthe eigenvalues in decreasing order and their corresponding eigenvectors, the\n\npoints distribution can be described with relation to extreme ellipsoidal shapes\n\n(Table 2). Woodcock (1977) and Vollmer (1990) define ratios that clarify the\n\nconcept of big and small eigenvalues. For Woodcock\u2019s method, the ratios170\n\nx = ln(\n?1\n?2\n\n) (7)\n\ny = ln(\n?2\n?3\n\n) (8)\n\nare used to analyze the data points distribution shape through Fig. 1.\n\nHowever, this graph is not of simple interpretation. Vollmer (1990), on\n\nthe other hand, proposes three equations that describe the dataset proximity\n\nto: point distribution (Eq. 9), in which the eigenvalues would be 1, 0 and 0;\n\ngirdle (Eq. 10), with eigenvalues 0.5, 0.5 and 0; or random (Eq. 11), with175\n\neigenvalues 1/3, 1/3 and 1/3. He also defines a cylindricity parameter (Eq. 12),\n\nbased on the logarithmic ratio between the first and third eingenvectors. These\n\ncoordinates can then be plotted to the triangular diagram on Fig. 2, being\n\neasier to understand.\n\nP =\n?1 ??2\nN\n\n(9)\n\nG =\n2(?2 ??3)\n\nN\n(10)\n\nR =\n3?3\nN\n\n(11)\n\nC = ln(\n?1\n?3\n\n) (12)\n\n29\n\n\n\n2.5. Counting grids180\n\nCounting grids are comprised of roughly regularly spaced nodes on the sphere\n\nor circle, where each node is calculated either by the fraction of points that are at\n\nan angular distance smaller than a chosen value or by a total value that depends\n\non the distance to each data point. Either way, it represents an estimate of the\n\nprobability density function for the data set.185\n\nThere are several different methods of producing a regular grid for calculating\n\nthis estimate (Diggle and Fisher, 1985; Kamb, 1959). A flexible form to build\n\nthe grid is suggested by Robin and Jowett (1986), in which the only parameter is\n\nthe great circle distance of the nodes, t. This value is directly used as a regular\n\nspacing of latitude circles. For each circle with an angle to the vertical direction190\n\nof v, nodes are spaced longitudinally along the circle with separation according\n\nto Eq. 13.\n\nFrom the direction cosines of the grid nodes the angle to each point is then\n\ncalculated by Eq. 14, and the value for each node can either be calculated as\n\nin Robin and Jowett (1986) through Eq. 15 or counting the number of points195\n\nwith angles within a limit. The constant K at Eq. 15 or the limit angle for\n\ncounting has the fundamental effect of smoothing the data points along the\n\nsphere allowing to emphasize large tendencies and reduce noise. The choice of\n\nthis factor must be made experimentally, but both Robin and Jowett (1986)\n\nand Diggle and Fisher (1985) suggest formulas to estimate optimal smoothing200\n\nvalues and, based on the first, AUTTITUDE calculates these values if not given\n\nby the user, allowing Diggle and Fisher (1985) as an optional.\n\nFor circular data it is a much simpler operation, only dividing the circle\n\nby the appropriate angular spacing to obtain the nodes, typically 1 degree for\n\ngeological data, and applying either Eqs. 16 or 18 for each counting node, being205\n\nh a smoothing factor. From these nodes it is possible to produce a continuous\n\nrose or kite diagram, which presents itself as a very interesting tool for visualizing\n\ncircular data (Fisher, 1993; Munro and Blenkinsop, 2012). Wells (2000) suggests\n\nanother method for smoothing circular data, which is effectively an average of all\n\n30\n\n\n\npossible rose diagrams considering different petal sizes and offsets from north.210\n\na =\n2(sin(\n\nt\n\n2\n))\n\nsin(v)\n(13)\n\n? = a cos(\nv \u00b7u\n|v||u|) (14)\n\nw =\n?\n\nek(cos ??1) (15)\n\nw =\n0.9375\n\nn?h\n?\n\n(1 ? ?\n2\n\nh2\n)2 (16)\n\nw =\n0.9375\n\nn?h\n?\n\n(1 ? ?\n2\n\nh2\n)2 (17)\n\nMwa =\n1\n\nA\n\nn=?+ A?1\n2?\n\ni=??A?1\n2\n\nFi \u00b7w|??\nA?1\n\n2\n| (18)\n\n2.6. Rotations and Change of Axes\n\nIt is often convenient or necessary to change the coordinate axes or rotate the\n\ndata. In the first case, the new coordinate system is defined by three orthogonal\n\naxes x?, y? and z? which must be of unit length to avoid deforming the spatial\n\ndistribution of the data, making the points no longer belong to the surface of215\n\na unit sphere. In order to project data to this system, the product expressed\n\non Eq. 19 is calculated. As an example, the projection of a data set using its\n\neigenvectors as new axes may be useful for symmetry check. Rotation, on the\n\nother hand, is made from a unit axis v and the anti-clockwise rotation angle\n\naround it ? from the matrix equation 20. Rotations can be used for restitution,220\n\nfor example, trying to reestablish the sedimentary transport trend of a cross\n\n31\n\n\n\nbedding stratification that was tectonically tilted.\n\nu? =\n\n?\n????\n\nx?\n\ny?\n\nz?\n\n?\n???? \u00b7u =\n\n?\n????\n\nx?xux + x\n?\nyuy + x\n\n?\nzuz\n\ny?xux + y\n?\nyuy + y\n\n?\nzuz\n\nz?xux + z\n?\nyuy + z\n\n?\nzuz\n\n?\n????

Projections\n\nThe most typical form of directional data representation in geology is def-\n\ninitely the projection (Fisher et al., 1987), be it of equal-angle (stereographic)225\n\nor equal-area (Schmidt-Lambert) (Fig. 3). The first has its main use in crystal-\n\nlography, where it is necessary to correctly represent the angles between crys-\n\ntal faces without distortion. However, for visualization of the distribution of\n\nattitudes only the second one lends itself adequately. While an equal-angle\n\nprojection will preserve the shapes, since circles on the sphere will remain as230\n\ncircles on the plane of projection, the density of points around the sphere will\n\nbe excessively distorted, as showed in the case of a regular grid on Fig. 4.\n\nConsidering the point v = x,y,z belonging to the sphere, its coordinates X\n\nand Y on the equal angle projection plane are given by Eq. 21. For equal area\n\nprojection Eq. 22 is applied.235\n\nX =\nx\n\n1 ?z,Y =\ny\n\n1 ?z (21)\n\nX = x\n\n?\n2\n\n1 ?z,Y = y\n?\n\n2\n\n1 ?z (22)\n\n32\n\n\n\n3. Development\n\nAUTTITUDE was originally developed in Python series 2.7.x (Python Soft-\n\nware Foundation, 2013), latter made compatible with series 3.x. Many of the\n\nused modules come from the Python Standard Library, such as regular expres-\n\nsions and CSV parsing. Besides that, xlrd (Python Software Foundation, 2016)240\n\nis used for reading data from Excel spreadsheets and Numpy (Oliphant, 2006)\n\nprovides support for vectors, matrices and linear algebra.\n\nThe use of Numpy greatly facilitates development and speeds up processing,\n\nas its numerical routines are written in C and Fortran and highly optimized.\n\nThis alleviates many problems inherent to interpreted languages such as Python,245\n\nallowing for fast processing of large datasets. Some of AUTTITUDE\u2019s routines\n\nuse functions that came originally from Scipy, a scientific numerical data pro-\n\ncessing library that is a superset of Numpy.\n\nFortran routines were written in Fortran 90, and compiled and linked as\n\nPython modules using the script f2py (Peterson, 2009), that automatically250\n\nwraps the given code and allows it to be called seamlessly from Python.\n\nThe final result was a Python library that can be used both for application\n\ndevelopment and as a platform for directional data analysis on a interactive\n\nenvironment. The source code of the developed packages and the data files used\n\nfor testing are available at Section 5.255\n\n4. Application of AUTTITUDE\n\nThe center piece of the library is the DirectionalData class. It serves as a\n\ncontainer for directional data and provides a series of automatically calculated\n\nstatistical parameters for both circular and spherical data. It can be used by\n\nproviding direction cosines as data along with any other additional parameters260\n\navailable, which when needed will be used in its submodules.\n\nThe first step in producing an object of the DirectionalData class is to load\n\nthe input data. For this it is either possible to use the universal loader, that han-\n\ndles file loading, universal translator, to convert attitude notations, and finally\n\n33\n\n\n\npass the data obtained to the DirectionalData class, or use the load function,265\n\nwhich will call each of these components in sequence.\n\nUniversal loader is responsible for automatically loading the data, dealing\n\nwith different file formats. In this release it is able to handle CSV, Numpy and\n\nExcel data types. From this, the universal translator translates the data from\n\ntheir notation to dip direction/dip format, as explained in Section 2.1. The file270\n\nin Ex. 1, frat.dat, shows a sample of the variety of notations that can be found.\n\nThis sequence of methods allows for greater flexibility in loading the data, using,\n\nfor example, other external functions among the steps. The load function follows\n\nthis basic sequence automatically, converting the data into direction cosines and\n\nloading them into an object of the DirectionalData class, which is returned by275\n\nit. It works transparently to the user, using default values or trying to extract\n\nthem from the data as shown in Ex. 1.\n\nThe last parameter called in the example, mode, which contains the counting\n\nnode with highest value, depends on a counting grid. By default, an axial count\n\nmesh is created with average spacing between nodes of 2.5 degrees and K is280\n\nestimated using the method in Robin and Jowett (1986). Since grid analysis\n\ncan be time-consuming, the counting grid is not created by DirectionalData\n\nuntil it is needed, storing the obtained result.\n\nThe counting grid is generically an object of the SphericalGrid class, which\n\ninternally constructs the regular grid and has methods for averaging by Fisher285\n\nDistribution (Robin and Jowett, 1986) or counting points within a threshold an-\n\ngle. Additionally, it is possible to operate it with any function whose parameters\n\nare a grid where it will be calculated and data to do the calculation.\n\nFortran versions of the couting methods and functions to automatically par-\n\nallelize counting where also developed. They are not used by default because the290\n\nadditional time spent preparing for parallel processing or importing the Fortran\n\nmodules is longer than the speedup in processing time for the typical amount\n\nof data in geological problems. They become more interesting for very high\n\nresolution grids, such as an average separation of one second of arc or very large\n\ndatasets.295\n\n34\n\n\n\nThe following examples are available as jupyter notebooks on the project\n\ngithub page (Section 5).\n\nEx. 1. >>>entry_file= universal_loader(\"frat.dat\")\n\n>>>entry_data = universal_translator(entry_file, dip\\direction=False)\n\n>>>frat = DirectionalData(dcos(entry_data))300\n\n>>>b = auttitude.load(b.csv)\n\n>>>data = load(\"tocher.txt\")\n\nFrom a DirectionalData a series of statistical parameters are available:\n\nEx. 2. >>>data.fisher_k\n\n2.0994328692611806305\n\n>>>data.eigenvalue[0]\n\n109.57337905751763\n\n>>>data.vollmer_C\n\n0.79271596847405035\n\n>>>print data310\n\ntocher.txt\n\nn = 200\n\nExpected Distribution:\n\nGirdle\n\nEigenvectors:315\n\n1: 204.5 / 1.0\n\n2: 295.4 / 42.2\n\n3: 113.4 / 47.8\n\nShape parameter\n\nK = 0.21320\n\nStrength parameter\n\nC = 2.07\n\nNormalized Eigenvalues:\n\nS1: 0.548\n\nS2: 0.383325\n\n35\n\n\n\nS3: 0.069\n\nFabric (triangular diag.):\n\nPoint = 0.165\n\nGirdle = 0.628\n\nRandom = 0.207330\n\n>>>spherical(data.mode)\n\n(16.6, 3.8)\n\nSome operations with DirectionalData objects are also possible, such as con-\n\ncatenate, which combines two DirectionalData, and the product, which calcu-\n\nlates all intersections (intersect) between two data sets (Fig. 5, Ex. 3). The335\n\nDirectionalData resulting from these operations inherit the additional parame-\n\nters from the first DirectionalData.\n\nEx. 3.

The resulting\n\nDirectionalData also inherits additional parameters from the original data.345\n\nEx. 4.

Conclusions\n\nThe creation of the AUTTITUDE library allowed the restructuring of the\n\nOpenStereo directional data analysis software. Additionally, it can be used for365\n\nthe treatment of directional data both directly and integrated in other applica-\n\ntions. Its integration with OpenStereo brings advantages to both software, since\n\nthe use of AUTTITUDE in a graphical interface facilitates the visualization and\n\nhandling of complex data sets while at the same time it brings to OpenStereo\n\nspeed, robustness and ease of implementation and maintenance. The tests per-370\n\nformed had positive results.\n\nThe library uses a permissive MIT license, and is available at the project\n\ngithub page. Suggestions, adaptations and contributions are very welcome, as\n\nare reports on any issues or bugs.\n\nSupplementary Material375\n\nSupplementary data related to this article can be found at https://git.io/vMjmu.\n\nReferences\n\nBingham, C., 1964.

Introduction\n\nA small circle is a set of vectors xi = {x1,x2...xn} on a sphere that have\na constant angular distance ? to a vector \u00b5. They arise on many different\n\nsituations on geological data such as planar attitudes measured on certain su-\n\nperimposed folding systems (Ramsay, 1962), conical folds at tappering ends5\n\nof cylindrical folding systems (Cruden and Charlesworth, 1972), paleomagnetic\n\ndata directions restoration (Pueyo et al., 2003; Mochales et al., 2016), linear\n\n?Corresponding author\nEmail addresses: arthur.correia@usp.br; endarthur@gmail.com (Arthur Endlein),\n\nginaldo@usp.br (Ginaldo Ademar da Cruz Campanha), camila.viana@usp.br (Camila\nDuelis Viana)\n\nPreprint to be submitted to Journal of Structural Geology May 22, 2017\n\n\n\nattitudes measured on folding systems that condition them to a constant angu-\n\nlar displacement from the fold axis or segments of hotspot traces (Mardia and\n\nGadsden, 1977) and transform faults. As noticed by Mulchrone et al. (2013),10\n\nthe most popular free available directional data analysis applications either do\n\nnot offer the functionality of small circle fitting or provide methods which may\n\nstruggle to estimate the best fit cone when dealing with complex distributions.\n\nSo far the axes for these small circles have been adjusted either by visual inspec-\n\ntion using ?-diagrams or by iterative numerical methods (Ramsay, 1962; Mardia15\n\nand Gadsden, 1977; Bingham and Mardia, 1978; Mulchrone et al., 2013). Un-\n\ntil present, there is no reliable graphical method for estimating best fit small\n\ncircles.\n\nThis work both uses the numerical method detailed on Bingham and Mardia\n\n(1978) and proposes a new graphical method, that reduces the problem to an20\n\nanalog of the ? or ? diagrams for great circles (Ramsay, 1967).\n\n2. Method\n\nA small circle with axis \u00b5 and half-apical angle ? can be defined either as\n\nthe intersection of a unit sphere and a cone with axis \u00b5 and half-apical angle ?\n\nor a plane with normal vector \u00b5 and distance to origin equal to sin(?).25\n\nBeing xi = {x1,x2...xn} column vectors that represents data points along a\nsmall circle, we define the average vector x?, orientation matrix S and covariance\n\nmatrix S? as\n\nx? =\n?\n\ni\n\nxi\nn\n\n(1)\n\nS =\n1\n\nn? 1\n?\n\ni\n\nxi \u00b7x?i (2)\n\n30\n\nS? =\n1\n\nn? 1\n?\n\ni\n\n(xi ? x?) \u00b7 (xi ? x?)? (3)\n\n49\n\n\n\nBingham and Mardia (1978) proposes that the eigenvector associated with\n\nthe smallest eigenvalue of S? as a good estimator for the small circle\u2019s axis, and\n\nthe arcsin of the dot product between the estimated axis and the data\u2019s average\n\nvector x? as an estimator for the half-apical angle.\n\nThis follows from the fact that the eigenvector associated with the smallest35\n\neigenvalue is parallel to the direction of most flattening of the data, and as such\n\na good estimate of the normal vector of a plane (Pearson, 1901). Watson (1966)\n\nprovides a physical interpretation for the smallest and largest eigenvalues and\n\nrelated eigenvectors of matrix S as the rotation axes through the origin with\n\nrespectively maximum and minimum moments of inertia, considering a system40\n\nwith particles of unit weight at the end of each vector. A similar analogy can\n\nbe made for matrix S?, with the difference that the axes are through the center\n\nof mass of the system, instead of the origin.\n\n2.1. Correction for Axial Data\n\nGiven the typical representation of axial data as vectors on the lower hemi-45\n\nsphere, the previous method may not work, as it strongly depends on the correct\n\nestimation of the average vector x?. For datasets that contains points that cross\n\nthe primitive (Fig. 1), the direct calculation of the average vector usually results\n\nin a subvertical vector with low magnitude, even though the data may be highly\n\nconcentrated in a preferential direction.50\n\n(figure 1 around here)\n\nAs a correction, it is possible to concentrate the data around either the\n\nlargest or the smallest eigenvector of matrix S, depending on the semi-apical\n\nangle of the small circle. Considering the components of a data point as xi =\n\n{li,mi,ni} and combining with the definition of matrix S results in55\n\nS =\n1\n\nn? 1\n?\n\ni\n\nxi \u00b7x?i =\n1\n\nn? 1\n?\n\ni\n\n?\n????\n\nlili limi lini\n\nmili mimi mini\n\nnili nimi nini\n\n?\n???? (4)\n\nAs during the calculation of Eq. 4 each cell consist on the product of two\n\n50\n\n\n\ncomponents, multiplying any data points by ?1 will result in the same matrix.\nHence, both matrix S and its eigenvectors and eigenvalues are insensitive to the\n\ninversion of points. The eigenvector v1 associated with its largest eigenvalue\n\nwill point to the axis of largest axial data concentration, as the eingenvector60\n\nv3 asssociated with its smallest eigenvalue will point as far as possible from the\n\ndata points.\n\nBy then comparing each vector xi and its inverse ?xi to both these eigen-\nvectors and in each case keeping whichever is closest, we may approximate an\n\naverage vector that better represents the real mean axis, allowing the calculation65\n\nof matrix S?.\n\nFor axial datasets that consist of a concentration along a preferred axis, v1\n\nis generally a good choice. In the context of small circles, though, concentrating\n\nalong this eigenvector may distort the circle, if the semi-apical angle is greater\n\nthan 45 degrees. In this case it is better to concentrate along v3. As a heuristic,70\n\nboth small circle axes can be calculated, keeping whichever has the smallest\n\nassociated standard deviation of angles to the data points.\n\nAnother possible solution is through visual inspection. By rotating the\n\ndataset so it doesn\u2019t cross the primitive, the average vector can be calculated\n\naccurately and the numerical method will then work in most situations.75\n\n2.2. Graphical Method\n\nThe covariance matrix can also be defined on the difference of pairs of data\n\n(Barnes (1991), adapted proof in Appendix A), through the equation\n\nS? =\n1\n\n2n(n? 1)\n?\n\ni\n\n?\n\nj\n\n(xi ?xj) \u00b7 (xi ?xj)? (5)\n\nFrom this, an approximate graphical solution to the problem can be realized.\n\nThough obtaining the difference vectors graphically would be cumbersome, a80\n\nunit vector (d) parallel to the difference vector of two points a and b can be\n\neasily constructed:\n\n51\n\n\n\n1. Find the great circle that contains both poles a and b. Mark its pole\n\n(c) and the midpoint (m) contained in the smallest angle along the great\n\ncircle between a and b (Fig. 2A).85\n\n2. Point d is the pole to the great circle that contains c and m (Fig. 2B)\n\n(figure 2 around here)\n\nThe pole to the great circle adjusted to these points is then an estimate of\n\nthe small circle axis, as an analog to the ? diagram (Fig. 2C) of a great circle\n\ngirdle, as is the intersection of their respective great circles, comparable to the90\n\n? diagram (Fig. 2D).\n\nThough being a less robust estimate of the axis, given that each vector will\n\nbe given equal weight regardless of its magnitude, this is a simple method that\n\ncan produce useful results.\n\n3. Examples95\n\nTo illustrate the method and challenges involved, we take as example points\n\non circles with horizontal axis due east and semi-apical angles of 30 and 60\n\ndegrees, adding noise to both samples (Fig. 3).\n\n(figure 3 around here)\n\nThe first case, with angle of 30 degrees, Fig. 3A shows fitted axes for x?, the100\n\nnon-corrected mean vector, with respective small circle dashed, and x??, the mean\n\nvector calculated with data points concentrated around v1, with solid circle.\n\nFig. 3B shows the point cloud resultant from the graphical method, applied\n\nexhaustively to all possible pairs of points. The best fit great circle girdle to\n\nthis point cloud is plotted with solid circle.105\n\nThe second case is meant to demonstrate the issue with large semi-apical\n\nangles. In this example (Fig. 4A), given the distance from the points to the\n\naxis, concentrating along v1 distorts the circle and gives a wrong axis (dashed\n\ncircle). The standard deviation of angles of the solution calculated using v3\n\n(solid circle) is then compared to the former, and v3 is kept as the answer.110\n\n(figure 4 around here)\n\n52\n\n\n\nIn this case, the graphical method result in a more dispersed point cloud,\n\nwhen applied to all possible combinations of the dataset points and their inverses\n\n(Fig. 4B). Either through visual inspection, when applied computationally, or\n\ncareful selection of points pairs when manually, a girdle may then be fitted to115\n\nthe resulting points.\n\n4. Conclusions\n\nThis work reviews and implement a numerical non-iterative method for small\n\ncircle data fitting, both robust and fast, that may be added to directional data\n\nanalysis software. It also proposes a graphical solution, that both allows for120\n\ndata fitting on paper but also may be implemented numerically and used as\n\ninput for visual inspection and fitting of complex datasets.\n\nWe have also explored a potential issue with large semi-apical angles, and\n\nstudied a method that in many cases corrects these problems. Further develop-\n\nments may include non-linear optimization methods, such as simulated anneal-125\n\ning, as to search for the best combination of inversion of points for the fitting,\n\navoiding distortions.\n\nThe numerical method has been implemented in the new version of Open-\n\nStereo (Grohmann and Campanha, 2010), allowing for both the automatic or\n\nmanual correction methods for datasets that cross the primitive.130\n\nReferences\n\nBarnes, R.J., 1991.

First the creation of a directional data\n\nanalysis library, AUTTITUDE, that encapsulates data input, pre-processing\n\nand numerical analysis (Endlein et al., a). From this framework it was possible15\n\nto concentrate the development of OpenStereo on a better user interface, offering\n\nadditional plot options, analysis methods and data management capabilities.\n\nBoth existing tools were expanded, such as the added option to calculate\n\ncontinuous rose diagrams (Munro and Blenkinsop, 2012), the inclusion of rota-\n\ntion and angle measurement to the projection plot, and new tools were added,20\n\nas projects, extracting planar attitudes from three-dimensional models and az-\n\nimuths and lengths from shapefiles.\n\n2. Functionality\n\nOpenStereo tries to simplify as much as possible loading data sets. In this\n\nrelease it supports loading data from Excel Spreadsheets and text files, either25\n\nin CSV or GeoEAS formats. If one of the specific import menus is used, such\n\nas Import Planar Data (Dip Direction) the software will handle the file format,\n\ndetect if it has a header and make a best guess on which columns should be\n\nused, defaulting to the first for dip direction and the second for dip. In case\n\nthere is any need of a finer control on the data loading, it is possible to open30\n\nthe import dialog (Fig. 1) and change any settings on the import process.\n\n(figure 1 around here)\n\nOpenStereo\u2019s plotting area is organized in tabs (Fig. 2): Projection, show-\n\ning spherical data projected in either Equal-Area or Equal-Angle projections,35\n\nRose Diagram, with either binned or moving average counts of circular data\n\nand Classification, which includes both Woodcock (1977) and Vollmer (1990)\n\n65\n\n\n\nmethods of distribution shape classification.\n\n(figure 2 around here)\n\n40\n\nThe Projection tab generically allows the plotting of vectors as points, circles\n\nas lines and counting grids as contours, whenever adequate to each data set type.\n\nIt also allows the rotation of the whole plot and the inclusion of grids with user\n\ndefined spacing of great and small circles (Fig. 3). The plot is also interactive.\n\nInspired by Stereo32 (Ro?ller and Trepmann, 2008) it is possible to measure45\n\nangles between points on the projection by click and drag.\n\n(figure 3 around here)\n\nThe Rose Diagram tab serves for plotting circular counts, either as petals,\n\nkites or lines (Fig. 4). The scale of the plot can be either set by the user or50\n\nobtained automatically from the given data. The underlying grid can also be\n\nconfigured, both the spacing of the grid lines and its span (Fig. 5).\n\n(figure 4 around here)\n\n(figure 5 around here)\n\n55\n\nThe classification tab allows choosing between Woodcock\u2019s adapted Flinn\n\ndiagram or Vollmer\u2019s triangular plot (Fig. 6). The points that are plotted on\n\nthe diagrams use the same settings as the vectors for the Projection tab.\n\n(figure 6 around here)\n\n60\n\nA major change relative to the original OpenStereo was the inclusion of\n\nprojects. OpenStereo project files are zip compressed folders with extension\n\n\u201d.openstereo\u201d. They include a json (http://www.json.org/) file containing the\n\ndata sets list and information relative to the project itself, such as title, author-\n\nship, description and specific parameters of the plotting tabs. For each data set65\n\nanother json file containing its plotting information is kept. These plot settings\n\ncan also be exported and imported individually as \u201d.os lyr\u201d files.\n\nIf desired by the user, the data files themselves are included inside the project\n\n66\n\n\n\nfile, being then decompressed on the fly for loading. If not, the data file paths\n\nrelative to the project file are saved, allowing the user to easily work on multiple70\n\ncomputers.\n\n2.1. Data Types and Properties\n\nThe software currently supports loading planes, lines, small circles and circu-\n\nlar data. After loading, the data set will be included in the items tree, showing\n\nas options its plot elements (Fig. 7). With the exception of \u201dRose\u201d, these refer75\n\nto plotting on the Projection tab.\n\n(figure 7 around here)\n\nEach supported data type has its own properties window, allowing the defi-\n\nnition of the plot options of each possible element. The Properties window (Fig.80\n\n8) of a planar dataset can be taken as a comprehensive example, being the other\n\ndata types effectively subsets of this one.\n\n(figure 8 around here)\n\nThe Projection tab houses options for plotting projections of vectors and85\n\ncircles, being them original from the input data, as poles to planes or great\n\ncircles or derived, as poles and circles of the dataset eigenvectors, average vector\n\nand best fit small circle.\n\nOpenStereo offer two ways to calculate the average vector. By default, the\n\nvector will be calculated directly from the direction cosines of the dataset. Alter-90\n\nnatively the data can be first oriented so it occupies the hemisphere defined by\n\nthe first eigenvector, which may give better results for sub-horizontal datasets\n\nthat cross the primitive (Endlein et al., a).\n\nThe best fit small circle is calculated as suggested by Bingham and Mardia\n\n(1978), with options for re-orientating the vectors to the hemisphere of one of95\n\nthe eigenvectors, as it heavily depends on a good estimate of the average vector\n\n(Endlein et al., b). This should be set to the first eigenvector for circles with\n\nsemi-apical angle of less than 45 degrees, otherwise to the third eigenvector.\n\n67\n\n\n\nAnother option for troublesome datasets is to rotate the projection until the\n\ncircle does not cross the primitive. This can be done on the Projection tab of100\n\nthe settings dialog, as explained above.\n\nThe second tab, Contours (Fig. 9), defines options for the calculation and\n\ngraphical display of counting grids. The grid may either be used to count points\n\nthat fall within a given ? angle to each node (Kamb, 1959), or sum for each node\n\na smoothing function of its angle to each point, controlled by a factor K (Robin105\n\nand Jowett, 1986). Both ? and K may be defined by the user or calculated\n\nautomatically by two different methods. The first one, from Robin and Jowett\n\n(1986), depends only on the number of points while the second (Diggle and\n\nFisher, 1985) performs an optimization based on the cross validation of the\n\nsmoothing function.110\n\n(figure 9 around here)\n\nPlotting circular data and horizontal components of spherical data is con-\n\ntrolled by the Rose tab on the properties dialog (Fig. 10). Here, it is possible\n\nto define whether dip directions or directions are going to be used and if these115\n\nshould be considered vectors, with direction and sense, or axes, with only di-\n\nrection (Fisher, 1993). The actual counting can be made as a standard rose\n\ndiagram, effectively a circular histogram, or as a moving average, weighted or\n\nnot (Munro and Blenkinsop, 2012). The results may be plotted as petals, kites\n\nor lines, the last from either the center of the diagram or as deviations from the120\n\naverage frequency (as suggested in Wells (2000)).\n\n(figure 10 around here)\n\nThe last three tabs, Statistics, General and Data Source contain respectively\n\nthe statistics for the dataset calculated automatically by auttitude, legend op-125\n\ntions for the plot elements and information on the import process of the data.\n\nThis last may either be used for solving problems on the data import or used\n\nby OpenStereo for reloading the data, as lines can be added or edited in the\n\noriginal source.\n\n68\n\n\n\n2.2. Mesh analysis130\n\nThe emergence of methods for easily building three-dimensional digital mod-\n\nels, either with terrestrial laser scanning or digital photogrammetry, have opened\n\na new venue for geological attitudes measurement. Ply2atti is a tool developed\n\nin a previous work that uses a combination of graph analysis and linear algebra\n\nto calculate the attitudes of selected planar features on a digital model of an135\n\noutcrop (Viana et al., 2016). It has been integrated in this version of OpenStereo\n\nas a tool.\n\nAn external software must be used to digitally paint the surfaces to be\n\nmeasured on the three-dimensional model, for example Meshlab (Cignoni et al.,\n\n2008), an open source model visualization and editing software. It is important140\n\nto use colors that do not appear naturally in the model, such as pure basic\n\ncolors, and as many planes as needed can be painted with the same color, as\n\nlong as they do not share a vertex. The model should then be exported in binary\n\nStanford Polygon format (.PLY ), and the colors used noted (Fig. 11).\n\n(figure 11 around here)145\n\nWhen opening the file for conversion in OpenStereo a dialog will appear\n\nwhere the colors used for painting the model can be input. By default, red (255,\n\n0, 0), green (0, 255, 0) and blue (0, 0, 255) will be suggested, but other colors\n\nmay be used (Fig. 12).150\n\n(figure 12 around here)\n\nThe internal processing of the dataset consists in building graphs using the\n\nvertices of the three-dimensional mesh that have the given colors, splitting the\n\ngraphs in their connected components to separate different planes, and for each155\n\nplane calculating the eigenvector associated with the smallest eigenvalue of the\n\ncovariance matrix of its vertices. This eigenvector is kept as the best fit nor-\n\nmal vector to the plane (Pearson, 1901). A CSV file containing the calcu-\n\nlated attitudes and some additional parameters is generated for each given color\n\nand loaded on OpenStereo, automatically changing the poles to planes color to160\n\n69\n\n\n\nmatch. Additional details on the method and procedure can be found at Viana\n\net al. (2016).\n\n2.3. Shapefile analysis\n\nAn experimental tool to convert lines shapefiles to circular data was also\n\nincluded in this release. The pyshp (Ian Bicking and Michael Foord, 2005)165\n\nlibrary is used to parse the shapefile, which must be in geographical coordinates.\n\nBeing r the average radius of Earth (6,371km), the length of each segment\n\nof each line in the file is calculated by taking the latitudes (?1 and ?2) and\n\nlongitudes (?1 and ?2) in radians of their endpoints and applying the haversine\n\nformula,170\n\na = sin2\n(\n?2 ??1\n\n2\n\n)\n+ cos ?1 cos ?2 sin\n\n2\n\n(\n?2 ??1\n\n2\n\n)\n\nc =atan2\n(?\na,\n?\n\n(1 ?a)\n)\n\nd =2rc\n\n(1)\n\nSimilarly the forward azimuth formula is used to calculate the bearing ? of\n\nthe segment,\n\n? = atan2 (sin (?2 ??1) cos ?2, cos ?1 sin ?2 ? sin ?1 cos ?2 cos (?2 ??1)) (2)\n\nThe resulting lengths and azimuths are exported to a CSV file and automat-\n\nically imported to OpenStereo as a circular dataset (Figs. 13 and 14).\n\n(figure 13 around here)175\n\n(figure 14 around here)\n\nBoth formulas where adapted from Chris Veness (2016). atan2 is a function\n\navailable on most programming languages that calculates the arctangent of the\n\nratio of its two parameters while comparing their signs to determine the correct180\n\nquadrant of the angle and handling cases in which one of them is equal to zero.\n\n70\n\n\n\n3. Development\n\nOpenStereo was developed in Python series 2.7.x (Python Software Foun-\n\ndation, 2013), though also being compatible with Python Series 3.x. Most cal-\n\nculations are actually performed by the AUTTITUDE library (Endlein et al.,185\n\na), which also uses the Numpy (Oliphant, 2006) library for vectors and linear\n\nalgebra and xlrd (Python Software Foundation, 2016) for excel spreadsheets\n\nparsing.\n\nPlotting is done using the Matplotlib (Hunter, 2007) library, which pro-\n\nvides methods for producing high quality figures and exporting the results in190\n\nmany different formats. An important change from the original implementation\n\nof OpenStereo was the switch from Wx (http://www.wxwidgets.org/) to Qt\n\n(https://www.qt.io/) as its graphical interface toolkit. This greatly facilitated\n\nthe development of the interface while also making it possible to internationalize\n\nthe software in the future. The specific Python implementation of Qt used was195\n\nthe PySide library (https://wiki.qt.io/PySide).\n\n4. Conclusion\n\nThis restructuring of OpenStereo greatly expands its capabilities, not only\n\ndirectly, by offering new tools and enhancing the existing ones, but also by\n\nfocusing from the ground up on making it easy to maintain and improve.200\n\nFuture developments will include paleostress analysis of faults, kinematic\n\ncriteria analysis of rock slopes, clustering datasets and expanding interactivity\n\nwith the plot area, such as allowing direct drawing of new data.\n\nSupplementary Material\n\nSupplementary data related to this article can be found at https://git.io/vMjma.205\n\nReferences\n\nBingham, C., Mardia, K., 1978.

The resulting\n\nsoftware is robust and fast, able to work with many different data sources, while helping\n\nusers manage their data and hopefully obtain new insights. It is much easier to maintain\n\nand extend, providing a strong foundation over which future projects may be developed.The\n\nAuttitude library is also an interesting subproduct, should it be used in other new software\n\nof on its own.\n\nThe research involved also generated a new graphical method for small circle data\n\nfitting, that though not perfect in all situations, can and will be further developed and\n\nmay result in other methods or applications of existing methods.\n\nFuture developments over both OpenStereo and Auttitude are planned, such as in-\n\ncluding new data types, plotting methods and workflows. Being open source projects,\n\ncontributions by other researchers and users will be invaluable, and it is hoped that this\n\nnew version will spark the growth of a larger community around OpenStereo.\n\n\n\n90 Chapter 6.
