A engenharia de tecidos da cartilagem \u00e9 uma \n\nalternativa emergente aos procedimentos da medicina tradicional, \n\nproduzindo estruturas porosas biomim\u00e9ticas capazes de mimetizar a \n\norganiza\u00e7\u00e3o estrutural das fibras de colag\u00e9nio, dependentes de \n\nprofundidade, da cartilagem articular nativa. O presente trabalho, \n\npretendia n\u00e3o s\u00f3 optimizar o tamanho dos poros da estrutura fibrosa \n\nelectrofiada das v\u00e1rias zonas que comp\u00f5em as estruturas porosas 3D \n\nanisotr\u00f3picas, desenvolvidas anteriormente pelo grupo de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nda equipa de supervis\u00e3o, como tamb\u00e9m recombinar estas zonas \n\nelectrofiadas em arquitecturas fibrosas 3D alternativas. Para atingir este \n\nobjectivo, tr\u00eas diferentes zonas de Policaprolactona (PCL) electrofiado \n\nforam montadas em diferentes arranjos dentro do hidrogel de \u00f3xido de \n\ngrafeno (GO)-colag\u00e9nio de modo a serem capazes de providenciar uma \n\nmalha porosa apta para protocolos de cultura de c\u00e9lulas, depois do \n\nprocesso de liofiliza\u00e7\u00e3o. Estas estruturas porosas de PCL-GO-\n\ncolag\u00e9nio foram caracterizadas de forma a avaliar a influ\u00eancia do \n\ntamanho e orienta\u00e7\u00e3o das fibras nas propriedades finais da estrutura \n\n3D. Foram feitos testes de biocompatibilidade com condr\u00f3citos em \n\ncultura est\u00e1tica nas diferentes zonas fibrosas que comp\u00f5em a estrutura \n\nporosa. Apesar dos resultados de biocompatibilidade serem \n\npromissores, estes mostraram que existe necessidade de continuar a \n\noptimiza\u00e7\u00e3o da porosidade das zonas fibrosas de forma a \n\npromover/facilitar a migra\u00e7\u00e3o celular atrav\u00e9s da estrutura porosa antes \n\nde se fazer ensaios de culturas celulares em ambiente din\u00e2mico num \n\nbioreactor. \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\nKeywords \n\n \n\nArticular Cartilage; Chondrocytes; Tissue Engineering; Nanofibrous \n\nScaffolds; Polycaprolactone, Electrospinning. \n\nAbstract \n\n \n\nInjuries of the articular cartilage are a huge problem in the present \n\nsociety. Cartilage tissue engineering is emerging as an alternative to \n\ntraditional medical procedures by producing biomimetic scaffolds \n\ncapable of mimicking the depth dependent nanostructural organization \n\nof the fibrous collagen network of the native articular cartilage. This work \n\nintended not only to optimize the pore size of the fibrous electrospun \n\nzones that comprise a 3D anisotropic scaffold previously developed by \n\nthe research group of the supervision team, but also to recombine these \n\nelectrospun zones in alternative fibrous 3D architectures. To achieve \n\nthis goal, three electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) zones were \n\nassembled in different arrangements within a graphene oxide (GO)-\n\ncollagen hydrogel capable of providing a suitable porous network for cell \n\nculture protocols after a lyophilisation process. These PCL-GO-collagen \n\nscaffolds were characterized with the purpose of evaluating the \n\ninfluence of the fibres size and orientation on the final properties of \n\nthese 3D structures. Preliminary biocompatibility tests on the different \n\nfibrous zones that compose the scaffolds were assessed with \n\nchondrocytes static cultures. Although the biocompatibility results were \n\npromising, the outcomes showed the need of the continuous \n\noptimization of the porosity of the scaffold fibrous zones in order to \n\npromote/facilitate the cell migration through the whole scaffold before \n\nstarting the dynamic cell culture in a bioreactor. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nI \n\nIndex \n\nIndex .............................................................................................................................

Framework \n\nOsteoarthritis is a chronic rheumatic condition, which is a degenerative disease that \n\nmainly affects the articular cartilage. It is claimed by the World Health Organization that \n\nosteoarthritis is one of the most disabling disease in developed countries. Indeed, \n\nsymptomatic osteoarthritis is estimated to affect 9.6% of men and 18.0% of women aged \n\nover 60 years, causing serious limitations in movement. This is where cartilage tissue \n\nengineering could interfere in order to produce materials capable of recreating an in vitro \n\ntissue capable of mimicking the depth dependent nanostructural organization of the \n\nfibrous collagen network of the native articular cartilage by combining biomaterials and \n\ncells with suitable fabrication techniques [1]. \n\nOne of these biomaterials is Polycaprolactone (PCL). PCL is a semi-crystalline polymer \n\nwith a hydrophobic nature; it exhibits a very slow degradation rate (2\u20134 years depending \n\non the starting molecular weight) that finds many applications in biomedical science owing \n\nto its superior mechanical properties, good biocompatibility, and complete degradation to \n\nnontoxic by-products. It is also a Food and Drug Administration approved material [2]. \n\nAdditionally, PCL is commonly used for the production of multilayer electrospun \n\nscaffolds by varying both the fibre size and orientation would create scaffolds with \n\ndifferent topographic and mechanical properties [2]. \n\nIn this study it was prepared four different fibrous/porous architectures of PCL\u2013\n\nGraphene Oxide-collagen (PCL-GO-collagen) scaffolds aiming to bring together the \n\nadvantages of the synthetic PCL, biocompatibility of collagen and the biochemical and \n\nmechanical properties of GO in order to mimic the anisotropic structure of the natural \n\narticular cartilage. The inclusion of collagen into PCL nanofibers was considered \n\nfavourable to cell attachment [2]. Electrospinning was used as fabrication technique and \n\nthe operating conditions were adjusted to obtain anisotropic scaffolds.  \n\n\n\n10 Chapter 1 \u2013 Introduction \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAt the end, the different electrospun zones that compose the scaffolds, as well as the \n\nPCL-GO-collagen scaffolds were morphologically, mechanically and biologically tested.  \n\nThe work developed in this thesis is integrated in the project \u201cARCADELIKE \u2013 \n\nDESENVOLVIMENTO DA ARQUITETURA FISIOL\u00d3GICA DA CARTILAGEM \n\nDESENVOLVIDA IN-VITRO POR COMBINA\u00c7\u00c3O DE EST\u00cdMULO MEC\u00c2NICO E \n\nSCAFFOLDS FIBROSOS ANISOTR\u00d3PICOS EM BIORREACTOR\u201d (REF. PTDC/EMS-\n\nTEC/3263/2014). The main objective of this project is to develop and fabricate anisotropic \n\nfibrous PCL scaffolds with depth-dependent variations in the fibrillar size and orientation in \n\norder to see how these variables dictate physical and mechanical properties, as well as \n\nthe cellular response in both static and dynamic (mechanical stimulation) cultures. Also, \n\nthis work is a sequence of a previous one that achieved a 3D fibrous scaffold with distinct \n\nbiomimetic zones through the assembly of electrospun PCL fibres with different \n\norientations by varying the electrospinning conditions [3]. \n\n \n\n1.2.  Objectives \n\nThis work is intended to optimize the original fabrication technique, the mechanical \n\nproperties of the scaffold and its biocompatibility. Thus, briefly, the goals of this thesis are:  \n\nI) Optimization of the pores size of the electrospun PCL 3D structure in order to \n\nenhance the cell proliferation and migration towards the scaffold. \n\nII) Fabrication and characterization of four scaffolds with different anisotropic \n\nproperties with the purpose of being used as alternative enhanced cartilage in \n\nvitro microenvironments able to promote cartilage regeneration by using \n\ndifferent pathways. Indeed, we expect that the distinct anisotropic signatures of \n\neach scaffold could offer similar mechanical and topographical characteristics \n\nand then, theoretically, influence the cell behaviour differently. \n\nIII) Evaluation of the biocompatibility of the different electrospun PCL zones that \n\ncompose the 3D anisotropic fibrous structures. \n\n1.3.  Document Organization \n\nThis dissertation is divided into six chapters. This first chapter presents a short \n\nintroduction, which includes a framework of the theme and the objectives of the \n\ndissertation. The second chapter exposes the state of the art with some concepts about \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Introduction 11 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthe natural articular cartilage, its constituents and tissue engineering (TE) related to it, \n\nscaffolds and nanofibrous scaffolds and the polymer polycaprolactone (PCL). The third \n\nchapter describes the methodology and the materials required to execute the \n\nexperimental work. Results and their discussion are presented at chapter four. The fifth \n\nchapter presents the main conclusions taken from this work, and some suggestions for \n\nfuture work. Then it follows the references of the citations made in the work and finally \n\nannexes. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\nChapter 2  \n\nSTATE OF THE ART \n\n \n\n \n\nThis chapter introduces the main concepts that fundament the experiments described \n\nin this thesis, such as the anatomy of native articular cartilage (section 2.1) and the \n\npotential of TE techniques as alternative treatments for repairing the injured cartilaginous \n\ntissue (section 2.2) focusing on the significance of Polycaprolactone (PCL) biocompatible \n\nscaffolds (sections 2.3 and 2.4). \n\n2.1.  Articular Cartilage \n\nArticular cartilage is a specialized connective tissue that covers the ends of synovial \n\njoints that allows the transmission of physiological loads to the underlying subchondral \n\nbone and friction-free movement of articulating joints providing the basis for the \n\nmovements of an organism. Since it is avascular (no blood supply) and aneural (no nerve \n\nendings), native cartilage owns a poor capacity to heal after injury [4][5]. \n\nThe articular cartilage is organized into three different zones (Figure 1) that are \n\nassembled in a depth-wise dependent hierarchical structure defined as follows: 1) a \n\nsuperficial zone which is composed mainly by collagen type II fibres produced by \n\nchondrocytes that are oriented parallel to the surface of the subchondral bone surface; 2) \n\na middle zone composed by collagen fibres randomly oriented; 3) a deep zone, where the \n\ncollagen fibres are oriented perpendicularly to the surface on the interface cartilage-bone \n\n[6]. Additionally, there are even who considers a fourth zone, this being the final one and \n\ncalled the calcified zone, which is responsible to connect the cartilage tissue to the \n\nunderlying subchondral bone [7,8]. The superficial zone makes up 10% to 20% of the total \n\ncartilage volume and has the highest amount of collagen. Having the highest amount of \n\ncollagen translates in high tensile modulus, making this zone resistant to shear, tensile \n\nand compressive forces imposed by the articulation at the joint surface. The middle zone \n\nhas around 40% to 60% of the total cartilage volume and is mostly composed of \n\nnegatively charged proteoglycans (forming the hyaline cartilage), which in turn attract \n\n\n\n14 Chapter 2 \u2013 State of the Art \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\npositive charges accompanied with water, making it a stable hydrated structure. The \n\nproteoglycans present in the middle zone are what gives the cartilage its compression-\n\nresistance properties due to the fact that it maintains the fluid within the tissue of the \n\ncartilage while it is being compressed. The deep zone represents 30% of articular \n\ncartilage and is responsible for providing the greatest resistance to compressive forces, \n\nsince it has the collagen fibrils arranged perpendicularly to the articular surface [6,9]. \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Section of cartilage with the three different zones: superficial tangential zone \n\n(STZ), middle zone and deep zone. A \u2013 cellular organization in the zones of articular \n\ncartilage; B \u2013 collagen fibre architecture. Adapted from: [9]. \n\n \n\nThe cells that reside within the cartilage are chondrocytes, a highly specialized cell line \n\nthat represents only 2% of the total tissue volume, being responsible for maintaining and \n\nproducing the extra-cellular matrix (ECM), mainly collagen fibres and proteoglycans. The \n\ncombination of these components with inorganic salts, small amounts of other proteins, \n\nlipids and glycoproteins is able to provide a suitable microenvironment capable of \n\nefficiently retaining water and consequently enhance the biomechanical properties, \n\nguaranteeing the functional behaviour of the cartilage [9,10]. The diffusion of nutrients and \n\nwaste is possible due to the cyclical compression of the articular cartilage providing \n\nchondrocyte homeostasis and a stale ECM which in turn provides the articular cartilage \n\nfrictionless joint and a stiff load-bearing tissue to absorb energy [11]. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 State of the Art 15 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCartilage self-repair ability is very limited since it is an avascular tissue rich in ECM, but \n\nlow in cell density (because of low mitotic potential of the chondrocytes). This is why \n\ncartilage lesions caused by trauma or diseases tend to progressively degrade the tissue \n\nand also originate diseases such as osteoarthritis. Indeed, small defects are healed with \n\nthe migration of chondrocytes, but the big defects are healed with fibrillar cartilage which \n\nturns out to be insufficient [4,5,10,12]  \n\n \n\n2.1.1.  Chondrocytes \n\nChondrocytes are the resident cells of the hyaline articular cartilage. These highly \n\nspecialized cells are responsible for the production of the basic ECM constituents: \n\nproteoglycans and collagen type II. Therefore they have an important role in maintenance, \n\nrepair, development and remodelling of the cartilage ECM [9,12]. \n\nChondrocytes are originated from mesenchymal stem cells and make up to 2% of total \n\nvolume of articular cartilage. Also, depending on the anatomical regions of the cartilage, \n\nthey vary in shape, number and size (Figure 2). In the superficial zone, chondrocytes are \n\nflatter, smaller and have greater density, enabling resistance to shear and tensile forces \n\nand, additionally, protecting and maintaining the deeper layers. In the middle zone, \n\nchondrocytes are spherical and have low density, making this zone the first line of \n\nresistance to compressive forces. While in the deep zone, chondrocytes are typically \n\narranged in columnar orientation, parallel to the collagen fibres and perpendicular to the \n\njoint line, providing the greatest amount of resistance to compressive forces. They \n\nrespond to different stimuli, such as growth factors, mechanical loads, hydrostatic \n\npressures and piezoelectric forces. However, their potential for replication is limited, \n\nmaking cartilage healing a problem [9,13]. \n\nChondrocytes are therefore essential for studies related to cartilage TE but when \n\ncultured in vitro they tend to dedifferentiate (that is, they lose their special form or function, \n\nor revert to an earlier developmental stage). So, supplemented medium and three-\n\ndimensional culture structures are used to maintain the chondrocyte phenotype [12]. Also, \n\nchondrosenescence (the deterioration of chondrocyte function related to age-dependency) \n\ncontributes for the age-related deregulation of subcellular signalling pathways in \n\nchondrocytes, which in turn decreases the synthetic capacity of the cartilage leading to \n\nthe manifestation of diseases such as osteoarthritis [14,15]. \n\n \n\n\n\n16 Chapter 2 \u2013 State of the Art \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 2 - Schematic representation of the multi-zonal structure of normal articular cartilage \n\nshowing the collagen and cell orientation. Adapted from[16]. \n\n \n\n2.1.2.  Collagen and Proteoglycans \n\nCollagen fibres (Figure 3) are one of the most common proteins in the body. It is mainly \n\norganized with three procollagen polyptide chains (approximately 100 amino acids each) \n\nthat are coiled in a ?-helix to make what is called tropocollagen, which in turn assembles \n\ninto larger fibres that crosslink in order to provide tensile strength. It\u2019s diameter in articular \n\ncartilage is between 25-40 nm in size [10,17]. Collagen is a natural polymer found in skin, \n\nbone, blood vessels, cornea, cartilage, gut, inter-vertebral disc, tendons and ligaments \n\nand comprises approximately 25%-35% of total body protein in the form of elongated \n\nfibrils. It possesses good tensile strength and elasticity and it can be found outside and \n\ninside the body cells providing support to body tissues [18,19]. In the collagen family there \n\nare 28 genetically distinct collagen types, being the most abundant the collagen type I \n\n(skin, tendon, and bone), collagen type II (cartilage), and collagen type III (skin and \n\nvasculature). These fibrillar structures are essential for tissue architecture and integrity. \n\n[17]. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 State of the Art 17 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 - Collagen fibres (with sizes that could vary between 40-100 nm in skin) from the \n\nsurface of parchment, as shown by Scanning Electron Microscopy. 123x magnification. \n\nAdapted from [20] \n\n \n\nProteoglycans are made of polysaccharide-protein compounds with a ratio of 95% \n\npolysaccharide and 5% of protein, and can exist in monomer or aggregates. In the core \n\nwe can find the polar polysaccharide glycosaminoglycan (GAG) which is covalently linked \n\nto the proteoglycans, acting as lubricant and shock absorber. It is also responsible for \n\nmaintaining osmotic pressure which is essential to keep the equilibrium between the \n\nexternal stress caused and the fluid flow in the ECM, complementing the tensile strength \n\nof the collagen fibres [10,21]. Proteoglycans influence nucleation and growth in \n\ndeveloping fibres and fibre diameter in mature fibres. They are anionic in nature and they \n\ncan bind with collagen (Figure 4) through non-covalently bindings [20]. \n\n \n\nFigure 4 - Diagrammatic representation of the binding of proteoglycan groups to collagen \n\nfibrils. The four big white circles represent the collagen fibrils, viewed down the main fibril \n\naxis. The shaded circles represent the protein core of the proteoglycans. The lines \n\nemanating from the protein cores are representative of the branched glycosaminoglycan \n\n(GAG) chains of the proteoglycans.

Cartilage Tissue Engineering \n\nCartilage TE emerges from a growing need to create a more durable and functional \n\nreplacement for the degenerated tissue of the native cartilage. The solution must be able \n\nto resist and operate in the same biochemical and mechanical conditions that the natural \n\ncartilaginous tissue is submitted to. The current clinical treatments, such as mosaicplasty, \n\nautologous chondrocytes injection, osteochondral autograft transplantation, osteochondral \n\nallograft transplantation and microfracture, show unsatisfactory long-term results, because \n\nof the new tissue formed lacking structural organization and having inferior mechanical \n\nproperties when compared to the native tissue. Furthermore, cultured chondrocytes, both \n\nin vitro or in vivo, tend to dedifferentiate into fibroblast-like shape, changing the production \n\nfrom collagen type II into type I (typical for fibrillar cartilage and mature bone, which has a \n\nfibrous network) and consequently affecting the functional features of the cartilaginous \n\ntissue [12,22]. \n\nUsually, damage to the articular cartilage can be due to congenital anomalies, \n\ndegenerative joint diseases (such as osteoarthritis) and traumatic injuries, which can \n\naffect every group age and are very painful. Since natural cartilage has an insufficient self-\n\nrepair mechanism due to its avascular and aneural nature, low level of chondrocytes \n\ndensity, low proliferative activity and the tendency of chondrocytes to de-differentiate, \n\ntreatment of damaged articular cartilage constitutes a challenge [12,23]. In fact, it is \n\naffirmed by Kock et al. [24] that osteoarthritis could affect all ages and around 70% of \n\npeople aged >65 years is affected by this disease. Also, Klein et al. [1] claims that \n\nosteoarthritis affects around 27 million Americans, and 6.6 million people in England alone \n\n[25]. In fact, according to the World Health Organization, in 2010, among 289 diseases, \n\nosteoarthritis was considered the eleventh leading cause of years lived with disability, \n\nbecoming then a research priority in the European Community countries [26]. Additionally, \n\nin the coming years the tendency to develop some type of osteoarthritis could get as high \n\nas 25% of the world population, making alternative approaches to the treatment of this \n\ndisease be particularly valuable [27]. \n\nTaking all this into account, the goal and also the biggest challenge of cartilage TE is to \n\nrecreate an in vitro tissue capable of mimicking the depth dependent nanostructural \n\norganization of the fibrous collagen network of the native articular cartilage by combining \n\nbiomaterials and cells with suitable fabrication techniques. In this way, it will be possible to \n\nsimulate the biochemical, mechanical and morphological properties of the native articular \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 State of the Art 19 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ncartilage and consequently provide enhanced chondrogenic conditions able to solve \n\nproblems as osteoarthritis [1,28]. \n\n2.2.1.  Scaffolds \n\nTE is a combined field of knowledge and technologies (in engineering, materials \n\nscience, biology and biomedicine) that are meant to improve or replace natural/biological \n\ntissues by combining biomaterials, advanced micro fabrication techniques and cell culture \n\nstrategies. Scaffolds can be used as support for cell migration, proliferation and \n\ndifferentiation, in order to promote tissue regeneration [29]. For cartilage TE purposes, an \n\nideal scaffold should be capable to provide a comfortable 3D niche for the cells and \n\nstimulate them to synthesize cartilage matrix, enabling the replacement of the native \n\nmatrix until the new cartilage is formed. These scaffolds should: a) be biodegradable, \n\nsterile, biocompatible and non-toxic; b) have a porosity that allows the diffusion of \n\nnutrients and waste products, support cell attachment, proliferation, differentiation and \n\nECM production; c) have elasticity and give mechanical support; d) be able to mimic the \n\nanisotropic morphology and biochemical environment of the different zones [12,30]. \n\nModern scaffolds are usually made of natural or synthetic polymers. Some examples of \n\nnatural polymers include proteins (such as silk, fibrin and collagen) and carbohydrates \n\n(such as agarose, alginate, hyaluronan and chitosan), which can both be used to fabricate \n\nhighly biocompatible hydrogels able to encapsulate chondrocyte cells without inducing \n\ndedifferentiation. These biomaterials have good biocompatibility, but lack strength and \n\ndimensional stability due to gelation and rapid hydrolysis in aqueous media [11,12]. \n\nHence, collagen and elastin-based substances are, for example, unlikely for vascular TE \n\n[31,32]. \n\nOn the other hand, synthetic polymers exhibit better strength and adaptability (are \n\neasier to tune) compared to natural polymers, but often do not allow cells to maintain their \n\nphenotype, leading to the production of ECM with different properties. Polylactic acid \n\n(PLA), polyglycolic acid (PGA), polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) and polycaprolactone \n\n(PCL) (Figure 5) are some examples of synthetic polymers [11,12].  \n\nSo, the combination of both types of polymers is essential to the development of a \n\nscaffold capable of mimicking the biochemical composition of ECM, and at the same time, \n\nowning good mechanical properties [31,32]. This was shown by Ahmed et al. [33] when \n\nthey combined collagen with synthetic polymers PLA and PLGA to develop a suitable 3D \n\nstructure to grow chondrocytes with minimal dedifferentiation for cartilage repair. Also, the \n\n\n\n20 Chapter 2 \u2013 State of the Art \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nfatigue levels of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel filled PCL scaffolds were studied at different \n\ndynamic conditions by Vikingsson et al. [34] with up to 100,000 cycles of unconfined \n\ncompression, and it was shown that the scaffolds were able to maintain their morphology \n\nand stress-strain response, withstanding the compressive forces and therefore, showing \n\nthat it can be used for regeneration of new tissue. In other example, Hsu et al. [35] \n\nshowed that the combination of poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) and PGA, modified with type II \n\ncollagen, increased chondrocyte proliferation and higher glycosaminoglycans and \n\ncollagen production. \n\n \n\nFigure 5 - Photography of a 3D synthetic polymer (PCL) microporous scaffold. Adapted from \n\n[36] \n\n \n\nAdditionally cartilage TE scaffolds can also be used in dynamic cell culture protocols, in \n\norder to predict their mechanical performance in vivo or/and to enhance cell response \n\n[37,38]. Indeed, several experimental studies using bioreactors concluded that appropriate \n\nmechanical stimulation can improve the mechanical properties of engineered cartilage \n\n[39]. For example, Spitters et al. have developed a bioreactor capable of combining cyclic \n\nmechanical loading and a nutrient supply similar to the cartilaginous microenvironment in \n\norder to modulate degenerative diseases [40]. In another work Jung et al. used \n\nmechanical stimulation of a 3D poly(lactide-co-caprolactone) to successfully enhance the \n\nchondrogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells, boost the production of \n\ncartilaginous ECM and promote the maintenance of chondrocyte phenotype [41]. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 State of the Art 21 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2.1.1.  ELECTROSPUN NANOFIBROUS SCAFFOLDS \n\nElectrospinning is a technique known for its affordability, simplicity, vast range of \n\nmaterial selection, and high flexibility in controlling diameters and spatial orientation which \n\nenables the production of nanofibrous scaffolds (Figure 6) with potential for applications in \n\nTE and regenerative medicine [42]. Thus, in order to mimic the fibrillar network of articular \n\ncartilage, nanofibrous scaffolds made by electrospinning are composed of fibres with \n\ndiameters on a nano scale, making them able to mimic the natural cell-ECM interactions \n\nand therefore promote the production of cartilage-like tissue to provide a new organized \n\nmatrix [11,24]. \n\n \n\nFigure 6 \u2013 Example of nanofibrous scaffold: homogeneous hyaluronic acid/collagen \n\nnanofibers and NaCl salts construct. Adapted from [42] \n\n \n\nIn TE, fibrous biomaterials present the most convenient architecture due to their high \n\nporosity, high surface volume ratio and topographic resemblance to the natural ECM [42]. \n\nThe nanofibre scaffolds possess high specific surface area for cell attachment, allow \n\noxygen permeability and prevent fluid accumulation making it also great for nutrient \n\ntransport. An higher microporous structure and a 3D biomaterial contact for cell \n\ninteraction, makes it possible to control cellular orientation and morphology in order to \n\nachieve the intended ECM architecture [31,43]. \n\nThese scaffolds can be made through a layer-by-layer method, varying both fibre size \n\nand orientation (by changing polymer concentration, collection conditions and collector \n\nvelocity to make fibres aligned or randomly oriented), rendering them suitable for making \n\nscaffolds capable of mimicking the different zones in articular cartilage and its properties \n\n(such has its organizational characteristic, the ability to successfully support cartilage \n\n\n\n22 Chapter 2 \u2013 State of the Art \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nformation and its superior mechanical features) [2]. The fact that is possible to make \n\naligned fibres is very advantageous, because it is ideal for cells that prefer some specific \n\ntype of cues to grow and migrate [31]. \n\n \n\n2.3.  Polycaprolactone (PCL) \n\nPolycaprolactone (PCL) is a biocompatible and biodegradable material used for \n\nmedical applications, drug delivery systems and packaging materials. PCL shows higher \n\npotential to prevent postsurgical adhesion and has more advantages over other synthetic \n\npolymers like PLLA, PAG, PLA and PLGA such as better mechanical strength, granting \n\nmore stability under ambient conditions, being cheaper and available in large quantities, \n\nand being able to last long enough for cell proliferation before it\u2019s in vivo degraded, when \n\ncompared to other synthetic polymers [44\u201346] \n\nPCL is a semi-crystalline and hydrophobic polymer soluble in a wide range of organic \n\ncommon solvents and hydrolyses under physiological conditions into water-soluble \n\nmonomers [47]. Indeed, the concentration of the polymer (solute), the type and \n\nconcentration of the solvent actively determines the characteristics of the resulting \n\nmeshes/scaffolds [48]. Also, it is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved \n\nmaterial, presents a very slow degradation rate (2\u20134 years depending on the starting \n\nmolecular weight) and has been used as a slow release drug delivery device and suture \n\nmaterial since the 1980s. PCL possesses a predictable and single low melting point (50-\n\n60\u00baC) and is characterized by its polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, being lower \n\nthan PGA and PLA. Also, its rheological and viscoelastic properties allow it to be used in a \n\nwide range of scaffold fabrication technologies. Due to these characteristics, it\u2019s use for \n\nscaffold fabrication is increasing within the TE community [49]. \n\nYet, PCL has some limitations, its hydrophobic nature leads to decreased wettability of \n\nthe surface which in turn disables the performance in cell adhesion, resorption and \n\nreproduction [44]. Also, PCL has poor mechanical strength for applications under load \n\nbearing conditions. In order to improve its mechanical properties, PCL can be combined \n\nwith other materials, such as nanoparticles [45]. Actually the use of PCL combined with \n\nanother material as a composite is very frequent, more than being used alone. A \n\nnanofibre composite scaffold was developed with PCL-graphene by Song et al. [50], \n\nproving that, besides having good mechanical properties (such as tensile stress and \n\nelastic modulus), it enhanced adhesion, differentiation and proliferation of mouse marrow \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 State of the Art 23 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nmesenchymal stem cells showing its higher biocompatibility if combined with other \n\nmaterials. In another study, electrospun PCL/GO-g-PEG structures (Figure 7) were \n\nstudied for its structural and reinforcing effect. It resulted in improved tensile properties \n\nand the preliminary biological assay showed enhanced capability for supporting cell \n\nattachment and growth [51]. Also, as Zhang et al. [52] showed the possibility of combining \n\nPCL with other polymers, mainly gelatine, resulting in the development of a scaffold with \n\nbetter mechanical properties and favourable wettability, which in turn improved cell \n\ninteractions, making it useful for applications in the biomedical field. \n\n \n\nFigure 7 \u2013 Usage of PCL meshes combined with other materials (GO-g-PEG): (a) PCL/GO-g-\n\nPEG 0.25 wt%; (b) PCL/GO-g-PEG 0.5 wt%; (c) PCL/GO-g- \n\nPEG 1.0 wt%. Scale bars are 20 \u00b5m. Adapted from [51]. \n\n \n\nPCL\u2019s capability for spinning allows its production in a fibrous form. Since it is an easy \n\nto use and cost effective, electrospinning is the most popular technique to fabricate fibrous \n\nPCL scaffolds (Figure 8) in order to be used in a broad range of biomedical applications \n\n[47]. Electrospinning is effective in producing ultrafine fibres with diameters ranging from \n\nmicrons to a few nanometres, by using an electric field to convert polymer solution into a \n\nfibre form. This happens due to stress created by applying electric current, creating a \n\ndeformation of the droplet, which is ejected as a fluid jet that is elongated and collected in \n\na collection device [52]. \n\n\n\n24 Chapter 2 \u2013 State of the Art \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8 \u2013 Morphology demonstration of PCL nanofibers produced by electrospinning. \n\nAdapted from: [53] \n\n \n\n2.4.  Polycaprolactone Scaffolds in Tissue Engineering \n\nApplications \n\nRecently, the use of PCL for scaffold fabrication has been increasing for biomedical \n\napplications, such as in the synthesis of complex biomaterials and TE. When making PCL \n\nelectrospun-scaffolds it is important to know the factors that influence the cellular \n\nprocesses: fibre diameter, fibre alignment, elasticity, pore size distribution and porosity, \n\nsurface topography and surface chemistry for improved cell-biomaterial interaction [49]. \n\nDual fibrous structures composed of microfibers and nanofibers produced from PCL by \n\nwet electrospinning (which has a liquid collector instead of a solid one, in order to produce \n\na bulky and fluffy material) are good to use as a scaffold. The fibres with bigger diameter \n\nhave better mechanical properties and larger pore size (essential for three-dimensional \n\ncell distribution), while the fibres with smaller diameters are good for cell adhesion inside \n\nthe scaffold [54]. \n\nTrilaminar fibrous scaffolds are important in order to mimic the morphological \n\nproperties of articular cartilage. These scaffolds can support the production of cartilage-\n\nlike extracellular matrix with depth-dependent organization, and this was achieved by \n\nMcCullen et al. [2] by sequential electrospinning (Figure 9). Varying fibre size and \n\norientation of PCL while changing polymer concentration and collection conditions, made \n\npossible the formation of zonally distinct cartilage layers. Their results showed that \n\ntrilaminar scaffolds yielded higher tensile properties compared to fully aligned and \n\nrandomly oriented fibres of the same or larger diameters. The trilaminar scaffolds \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 State of the Art 25 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nmanaged to get not only aligned cell morphologies in the superficial zone and spread in \n\nthe randomly oriented in the deep zone of the scaffold, but they also enhanced a superior \n\nproduction of collagen type II. \n\n \n\nFigure 9 \u2013 Different concentrations and collecting conditions of sequential electrospinning \n\nof poly(e-caprolactone) were performed to generate dense fibres.

[55] have produced bilayered scaffolds (Figure 10) by \n\nelectrospinning in order to mimic the functional interfaces and organization of articular \n\ncartilage. They noticed that their scaffolds demonstrated zone differences in cellular \n\nproliferation, biochemical composition and gene expression, proving that their results \n\ncould be used in developing regenerative medicine strategies. They acquired these \n\nresults by making a fibre zone composed aligned electrospun PCL on the surface of a \n\nPCL 3D porous structure. In another study made by Yang et al. [56], a scaffold consisting \n\nof fibrous PCL and methacrylated gelatine was conceived, which allowed the creation of a \n\nmulti-layered structure tendon-like through photo-crosslinking of scaffold sheets. They \n\ntested this scaffold with human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) and noticed that the \n\ncells align along the orientation of the fibres and adopted tendon cell phenotype upon \n\ntreatment with TGF-b3 growth factor, providing a mimic between the scaffold and natural \n\ntendon. \n\n\n\n26 Chapter 2 \u2013 State of the Art \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10 - Bilayered cartilage scaffold schematic. Diagram illustrating the electrospun fibre \n\nzone (FZ) deposited on a porous zone foam (PZ) forming an anisotropic scaffold. Adapted \n\nfrom [55]. \n\n \n\nLi et al. [57] showed that 3D nanofibrous PCL were able to successfully support \n\nchondrocyte phenotype and matrix deposition (including collagen type II and IX). They \n\nachieved this mark by seeding foetal bovine chondrocytes cultured in medium with ITS+ \n\n(Insulin, Transferrin, Selenium), ascorbate and dexamethasone fibrous scaffold, that was \n\nable to recreate biomimetic characteristics, concluding that the PCL nanofibrous was \n\nsuitable in scaffold biomaterials for cartilage TE applications. \n\nThe effects on mechanical properties of PCL could be enhanced by decreasing the \n\nfibre diameter, thus, improving the crystallinity, and by doing that, increasing the tensile \n\nstrength and stiffness of the fibres, as shown by Wong et al. [58] when reducing the fibres \n\nto 700 nm. \n\nWhen using a swine model to repair cartilage defects, Li et al. [59] produced a \n\nbiodegradable PCL nanofibrous scaffold seeded either with allogeneic chondrocytes or \n\nxenogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and compared them with an acellular \n\nPCL scaffold and a non-implant model. The difference was clear, the chondrogenic and \n\nMSC seeded scaffolds showed more complete repair when compared to the other two. \n\nChondrogenic seeded scaffolds showed a fibro-cartilage like tissue, and the MSC ones \n\nshowed hyaline cartilage like tissue. They also did a mechanical test showing that the \n\nhighest equilibrium compressive stress was achieved by MSC-seeded scaffolds (1.5 \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 State of the Art 27 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMPA), followed by chondrocyte-seeded scaffolds (1.2 MPa) and the no-implant scaffold \n\nshowing the lowest (0.2 MPa). \n\nIn complex cartilage TE strategies, electrospun nanofibers can be combined with \n\nhydrogels, which add to the topographic cues a three-dimensional environment for the \n\ncells that can also be loaded with growth factors, making it useful for repair of damaged \n\ncartilage, among other applications [60]. By adding an hydrogel to a PGA nanofibrous \n\nscaffold, Yang et al. [43] managed to develop an easy way to handle and apply \n\ncomposites with three nanofibre mesh layers and different internal orientations. \n\nAdditionally, they managed to get human corneal fibroblasts to attach and proliferate in \n\nthe different zones, and at the end of two days, cells replicated the nanofibers orientation \n\n(both aligned horizontal and vertical, and random-middle zone). \n\nIn another strategy, by using a perfusion reactor system, Silva et al. [61] managed to \n\nproduce proliferation, support attachment and chondrogenic differentiation in bone-\n\nmarrow mesenchymal stem cells by using electrospun PCL nanofibre meshes at a \n\nconcentration of 17%, producing nanofibers with a thickness between 40-60 \u00b5m, 70-80% \n\nof porosity and an average pore size of 2.7 \u00b5m. \n\nMore recently an approach for tracheal TE was made by preparing a hybrid 3D scaffold \n\nbased on PCL/Decellularized aorta (Figure 11). The mechanical properties, morphology, \n\nhistology and also the outcomes of heterotopic transplantation in a rabbit were analysed. \n\nIt was concluded that PCL maintained the rigidity of tissue engineered trachea when \n\ncombined with the decellularized aorta and that it was suitable for  tracheal TE due to its \n\ngood mechanical properties, biocompatibility and cell adhesion [62]. Through the \n\ncombination of PCL scaffolds embedded with europium hydroxide nanorods (EHNs), \n\nAugustine et al. [63] proved that the scaffolds with smaller weight percentage of the EHNs \n\nhad increased tensile modulus and in in vitro studies they showed to have improved \n\nbiocompatibility and cell adhesion properties. Also in vivo testing showed enhanced \n\nangiogenesis proving it could be used for TE applications. \n\n\n\n28 Chapter 2 \u2013 State of the Art \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 11 \u2013 Schematic representation of the tissue-engineered tracheal hybrid scaffold and \n\nits implantation. Three different types of electrospinning scaffolds based on PCL and \n\ncollagen, were seeded by primary chondrocytes and adipose derived mesenchymal stem \n\ncells (AMSCs). The selected seeded scaffolds were attached to the acellular aorta, \n\nimplanted into rabbit's muscle and harvested after 3 weeks. Adapted from [62]. \n\n \n\nThe combination PCL-PEG-PCL both as a scaffold/hydrogel (Ko et al.[64]) and as a \n\nfilm (Fu et al.[65]) demonstrated the ability for cells to manifest chondrogenic phenotype \n\nand produce cartilaginous ECM. In fact, the PCL-PEG-PCL film was implanted in rat knee \n\ndefects and eight weeks after surgery, a new cartilage-like tissue was formed in the defect \n\nsite, showing a grate capacity for repair of cartilage defects. \n\nGraphene oxide and GO-polymer composites have been receiving special attention for \n\nits application in TE due to its biocompatibility and capacity for widely positive interaction \n\nand proliferation of different types of cells. A graphene oxide (GO)-poly (?-caprolactone, \n\nPCL) scaffold was created to confirm its good biocompatibility and myoblast \n\ndifferentiation. The results proved the biocompatibility of the scaffolds, being a good \n\ncandidate for tissue regeneration[66]. \n\nTaking everything into account, in this thesis it is presented four different anisotropic \n\nPCL fibrous architectures capable of combining fibrous and porous features in order to \n\nrecreate specific 3D biomimetic microenvironments that are able not only to simulate the \n\ndepth-dependent variations of each cartilaginous zone, but also to provide a \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 State of the Art 29 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nbiocompatible and water retaining GO-collagen porous network suitable for cartilage TE \n\nprotocols. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\nChapter 3  \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n \n\n \n\nThe starting point of the work described in this thesis was the conception and fabrication \n\nof an anisotropic tri-layered fibrous-porous PCL-GO-collagen scaffold developed by our \n\nresearch group through the on-going project \u201cARCADELIKE \u2013 DESENVOLVIMENTO DA \n\nARQUITETURA FISIOL\u00d3GICA DA CARTILAGEM DESENVOLVIDA IN-VITRO POR \n\nCOMBINA\u00c7\u00c3O DE EST\u00cdMULO MEC\u00c2NICO E SCAFFOLDS FIBROSOS \n\nANISOTR\u00d3PICOS EM BIORREACTOR\u201d (REF. PTDC/EMS-TEC/3263/2014). Therefore, \n\nthis chapter will firstly describe the methods used for the design and fabrication of the \n\noriginal PCL-GO-collagen scaffold (3.1) in order to contextualize the work developed \n\nduring the optimization of the porosity of the fibrous electrospun network (3.2), the \n\nfabrication and characterization of four different scaffold architectures (3.3) and the \n\nbiocompatibility testing of the individual scaffold fibrous and porous components (3.4). \n\n \n\n3.1.  Scaffold Design and Fabrication \n\nIn order to recreate the 3D anisotropic fibrous structure of the cartilage, two different \n\nelectrospinning methodologies (NANON-01A electrospinning machine) were used: \n\ntowards making the superficial and the deep zones it was used a rotating fibre collecting \n\ndevice, which allows the alignment of the fibres; for the middle zone an ethanol (C2H6O) \n\nand water (H2O) bath was used as the collector for the fibres in a random orientation (wet \n\nelectrospinning). After that, the individual electrospun layers were assembled in the \n\ninterior of a GO-collagen hydrogel and submitted through a lyophilization process to \n\nguaranty a biocompatible microporous porous structure capable of not only physically \n\nsupport the fibrous layers, but also improve the swelling properties of the overall system.  \n\nThe GO-collagen hydrogel was fabricated according to [67]. Briefly, a GO aqueous \n\ndispersion with a concentration of 4 mg/mL (from Graphenea\u00ae) and a collagen solution \n\n\n\n32 Chapter 3 \u2013 Materials and Methods \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(collagen type I of rat tail in a concentration of 2.16 mg/mL in 0.6% of acetic acid (First \n\nLink Ltd) were mixed at pH = 2 with a 24 %w/w ratio col/GO , shaken for 10 seconds and \n\ncentrifuged (Thermo Scientific\u2122 Heraeus\u2122 Multifuge\u2122 X1 Centrifuge) for 10 minutes at \n\n10 000 RPM. \n\n \n\n3.1.1.  Electrospinning Production of Fibrous Structures \n\nTo prepare the scaffold, the polymer PCL used presented a molecular weight of 80 000 \n\nDa, (Sigma Aldrich\n\u00ae\n). PCL was dissolved with a concentration of 12% in Dichloromethane \n\nand Dimethylformamide (Sigma Aldrich\n\u00ae\n) with a ratio of 8:2 (v:v) overnight while being \n\nagitated at room temperature. \n\nFor the production of the superficial and deep zones (Figure 12), the PCL solution was \n\nelectrospun with a flow rate of 1 mL/h, a voltage ranging between 18-25 kV, a working \n\ndistance (needle-collector) of 15 cm and a spinneret velocity of 5 mm/s. To ensure the \n\nfibres alignment, they were deposited during 5 hours on an aluminium foil that was fixed \n\non the rotating collector device with a diameter of 10 cm and a speed of 2500 rotations \n\nper minute (RPM). The resulting electrospun mesh (approximately 100 \u00b5m of thickness) \n\nwas then cut into 5 mm diameter cylinders. For the deep zone, rectangles with 2 mm \n\nwidth and 4 cm length were cut and rolled up into the shape of a spiral with 5 mm of \n\ndiameter. This process occurred within a GO-collagen hydrogel in order to have the \n\nfibrous spiral branches intercalated with a micro-porous network after the process of \n\nlyophilization. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Materials and Methods 33 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 12 - Production of the superficial (blue) and deep zone (yellow). Natural cartilage \n\nscheme adapted from [9] \n\n \n\nThe middle zone was electrospun (Figure 13) with a flow rate of 1 mL/h, with a voltage \n\nbetween 20-30 kV, for a period of 30-40 seconds, using a 10 cm working distance \n\nbetween the needle and an ethanol:water bath in a ratio of 9:1 (v:v). The middle zone \n\nfibres were then placed into a cylindrical mould (5 mm of diameter and 2.5 mm of high) for \n\nshaping and stored in distillate water. \n\n\n\n34 Chapter 3 \u2013 Materials and Methods \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 13 - Production of the middle zone (red). Natural Cartilage scheme adapted from [9] \n\n \n\n \n\n3.1.2.  PCL-GO-Collagen Scaffold Assembling \n\nIn order to assemble the scaffold, two moulds of Teflon were used, containing 6 \n\ncylinders each. Both moulds have 5 mm in depth but vary in the diameters of the \n\ncylinders: the first mould present cylinders with a diameter of 5 mm and the second have \n\n10 mm of diameter (Figure 14). The mould with the smallest cylinder diameter was used \n\nto assemble the three different electrospun zones by combining the deep zone (5 x 2 \n\nmm), the middle zone (5 x 2.5 mm) and the superficial zone (5 x 0.5mm), which thickness \n\nwas achieved by piling up the small electrospun cylinders. All the electrospun layers were \n\nprevious immersed in ethanol and distilled water before assembly in order to sterilize them \n\nand remove the impurities. After assembly, the 3D electrospun structures were stored in \n\nthe freezer at -20\u00baC for 4h. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Materials and Methods 35 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 14 - Mould 5x10 (left) and mould 5x5 (right) \n\n \n\nAfter this period, the frozen electrospun PCL structures were placed in the mould with \n\nthe biggest diameter, which was previously filled with the GO-collagen hydrogel.  \n\nFinally, the PCL-GO-collagen scaffolds were freeze-dried by lyophilisation (Telstar \n\nlyoQuest HT-40, Beijer Electronics Products) at -80 \u00baC in order to produce a \n\ncomplementary 3D fibrous-porous microenvironment (Figure 15). \n\n \n\nFigure 15 - Assembling process of PCL-GO-collagen scaffold. The superficial zone \n\n(highlighted in blue), middle zone (highlighted in red) and deep zone (highlighted in yellow) \n\nwere put in the 5x5 mould. After being frozen, the 3D anisotropic fibrous structure were \n\nincorporated in the hydrogel on the 5x10 mould and submitted to lyophilization. \n\n\n\n36 Chapter 3 \u2013 Materials and Methods \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.  Optimization of Fibrous Structure Porosity \n\nIn order to enhance cell migration and proliferation for future cartilage TE applications, \n\nit was required to optimize the structure porosity of the scaffold according to the results \n\nacquired through previous work (Table 1). The goal was to achieve a large percentage of \n\npores with a diameter superior to 10 ?m. \n\n \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Characterization of pore size and fibre diameter of the electrospun meshes \n\ndeveloped previously by our group. \n\nSuperficial and Deep zones fibres Middle zone fibres \n\nFibre diameter 1.2 \u00b1 0.5 ?m Fibre diameter 2.2 \u00b1 0.3 ?m \n\nAverage Pore \n\nsize \n\n2.6 \u00b1 1.9 ?m Average Pore \n\nsize \n\n9.0 \u00b1 4.4 ?m \n\n \n\n3.2.1.  Optimization of Superficial and Deep Zones \n\nConcerning to the optimization of the superficial and deep zones porosity, the velocity \n\nof the rotating collector device and the horizontal velocity of the deposition needle were \n\naltered. The other variables were maintained constant in all tests: solution concentration \n\n(12% PCL), flow rate (1 mL/h), spinneret width (30mm), voltage (25kV) and working \n\ndistance (15cm). \n\nThe Table 2 summarizes the studied possibilities. Three different velocities were \n\nimplemented on the rotating collector (25 RPM, 250 RPM and 2500 RPM) at a spinneret \n\nvelocity of 10 mm/s and different spinneret velocities (1mm/s, 5mm/s and 10mm/s) at a \n\nrotating collector speed of 2500 RPM. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Materials and Methods 37 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2 - Different parameters studied for the optimization of the superficial and deep zone, \n\nhighlighted with X.  \n\n \nCollector velocity (RPM) \n\nSpinneret velocity \n\n(mm/s) \n25 250 2500 \n\n1 \n  \n\nX \n\n5 \n  \n\nX \n\n10 X X X \n\n \n\n3.2.2.  Optimization of the middle zone \n\nIn regard to optimize the middle zone porosity the only parameter that was changed \n\nwas the horizontal velocity of the deposition needle (0mm/s, 1mm/s and 10mm/s), while \n\nthe others were maintained, such as the time of deposition (30s), voltage (20-30kV), \n\nsolution concentration (12% PCL), flow rate (1 mL/h) and working distance (5cm).  \n\n3.3.  Different Architectures \n\nAs soon as the fibrous structure porosity was optimized, four scaffold (PCL-GO-\n\ncollagen) architectures were designed in order to study the influence of the fibre \n\norientation in the mechanical properties and consequently the cell response. The scaffolds \n\nwere made by adapting the described protocol (Chapter 3.1) to different architecture \n\ndesigns that will be described in section 3.3.1. \n\n \n\n3.3.1.  Architectures Description \n\nFour architectures were chosen for the research. The selected architectures (Figure \n\n16) were denominated as H1 (the three zones of the scaffold described in the process of \n\nassembling at 3.1.1), H2 (composed by the superficial and middle zones), H3 (composed \n\nby the superficial and deep zones) and H4 (composed of middle and deep zones). All four \n\narchitectures were made and assembled in the same moulds and in the same conditions \n\nas previously described (3.1.1). \n\n\n\n38 Chapter 3 \u2013 Materials and Methods \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nH2 architecture was made with a 2.5 mm height superficial zone, achieved by stacking \n\nelectrospun cylinders with a thickness of 100 \u00b5m, and a 2.5 mm height middle zone. \n\nH3 architecture was composed of a 2.5 mm height superficial zone and a 2.5 mm \n\nheight deep zone. In order to acquire the 2.5 mm height deep zone, rectangles with 2.5 \n\nmm width and 4 cm length were cut and rolled up into the shape of a spiral with 5 mm of \n\ndiameter within a GO-collagen hydrogel in order to make the spiral intercalated with a \n\nmicro-porous layer after the process of lyophilization. \n\nH4 architecture was built with a 2.5 mm height middle zone and a 2.5mm deep zone. \n\n \n\nFigure 16 - Architectures description and design. \n\n \n\n3.3.2.  Mechanical and Topographic Characterization \n\nThe mechanical testing was done by using a Shimadzu MMT-101N (Shimadzu \n\nScientific Instruments) (Figure 17) with a load cell of 100N. The compressive properties of \n\nthe four different scaffold architectures were done in a wet state and they were \n\ncompressed at a rate of 1 mm/min up to 15% of strain after a pre-charge of 0.07N. \n\nAlthough, the dimensions of the PCL-GO-collagen scaffolds tested were 10mm in \n\ndiameter and 5mm in height, it was only considered a diameter of 5 mm since it was the \n\nright dimension for the interior fibrous structure of the scaffold. The compressive moduli of \n\nthe samples were calculated through the study of the stress-strain curves calculated from \n\nthe slope at low strain (0-15%). An identical methodology was applied for the three zones \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Materials and Methods 39 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nwhen studied in separate, before the assembling into scaffold. The superficial zone \n\nsamples had 5 mm diameter and 0.5mm height, while the middle zone samples had 2.5 \n\nmm height and 5 mm diameter and the deep zone samples had 2 mm height and 5 mm \n\ndiameter. Also, it was studied the tensile properties for the superficial zone, using the \n\nsame protocol previously described after the set-up of the machine was changed to study \n\ntensile modulus. For this test the superficial zone samples had 15 mm in height, 5 mm in \n\nwidth and with 250\u00b5m thickness.  \n\nThe swelling properties were studied for the four different architectures and their \n\nstructural resistance in water were evaluated by immersing the samples into distilled water \n\nat room temperature for a period of 24 h. The swelling ratio was calculated with the \n\nfollowing equation: \n\n                       \n       \n\n  \n \n\nThe fibres diameter and the pore size characterization of the three different zones \n\n(sections 3.2 and 3.3.2) were made through pictures taken with scanning electron \n\nmicroscope (SEM) (Hitachi SU 70; Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Krefeld, F.R., \n\nGermany) and analysed with the ImageJ software. The samples were fixed with carbon \n\ntape (Emitech K950 equipment) on the specific support for SEM and suffered sputter \n\ncoating with gold (Au) in order to be analysed in SEM. At least 5 samples were used for \n\neach test. \n\n\n\n40 Chapter 3 \u2013 Materials and Methods \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 17 - Image taken of the Shimadzu MMT-101N mechanical testing machine while \n\ntesting the tensile properties of a sample from the superficial zone. \n\n3.4.  Biocompatibility Testing \n\nTo start testing the biocompatibility of the PCL-GO-collagen scaffolds, the various \n\ncomponents that make the composition of the scaffolds were first studied separately, each \n\nelectrospun PCL zone and the hydrogel (GO-collagen) so that it could be possible to \n\nanalyse the cellular response in each scaffold component. Cartilage progenitor cells were \n\nused and at determined time-points, samples were evaluated for cell metabolic activity \n\nand morphology. \n\n \n\n3.4.1.  Cell Expansion \n\nThe cells used for seeding the scaffolds were cartilage progenitor cell (Sigma Aldrich). \n\nThese were the bovine (Bos taurus (Holstein-Fresian)) articular cartilage progenitor cell \n\nline that are able to re-differentiate into articular chondrocytes after extensive population \n\ndoublings (>30 population doubling). \n\nThe cryopreserved cells were quickly thawed and cultured in 25 cm\n2\n tissue culture \n\nflasks containing Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 Ham (Sigma-\n\nAldrich), supplemented with 10% v/v inactivated foetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich) and \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2013 Materials and Methods 41 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1% v/v penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37\u00baC under a 5% CO2 humidified \n\natmosphere. The medium was refreshed every 3 days. Cells were harvested at pre-\n\nconfluence using a 0.25% trypsin/EDTA solution and used in the passage seven. \n\n \n\n3.4.2.  Cell Seeding \n\nBefore cell seeding there were a few steps to consider in order to render the scaffolds \n\nto be suitable for cell proliferation. Scaffolds were sterilized in ethanol 70% for a period of \n\nat least 3 hours, washed with PBS three times (first for a period of 5 minutes, then 15 \n\nminutes and at last 30 minutes) and incubated with culture medium for 2 hour to promote \n\nthe increase of cell attachment. \n\nAfter this process, the scaffolds were ready for cell seeding. They were firstly seeded \n\nwith 0,5 x 10\n6 \ncells/scaffold and incubated for a period of 2 hours at 37\u00baC under a 5% CO2 \n\nhumidified atmosphere. Afterwards, culture medium was added until it reached a final \n\nvolume of 1mL per well. The scaffolds were maintained in culture in the same conditions \n\nas cell expansion for 21 days and the medium was refreshed every 3 days. Positive (only \n\ncells) and negative (only scaffold) controls were used. \n\n3.4.3.  Cytochemical Staining of Actin Filaments and Nuclei \n\nTo have an idea of how, where and if the cells could infiltrate the scaffolds through all \n\nof its structure, a cytochemical staining of actin filaments and nuclei was used to visualize \n\nthe cytoskeleton organization through the three different zones in separate for 1 and 2 \n\nweeks. After fixation with 4% w/v paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilization with \n\n0.1% v/v Triton X-100, cells were stained for F-actin filaments (Phalloidin-iFluor 488; \n\nABCAM) and for nuclei (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich) during 90 \n\nminutes in the dark at 37\u00ba C and then visualized using a fluorescence microscope \n\n(Axioimager M2, Zeiss) with magnification of 10x/0.25. \n\n \n\n3.4.4.  Metabolic Activity Measurement \n\nThe metabolic activity of the cells in the three different zones can be measured with the \n\nuse of resazurin, a cell permeable compound that is blue in colour and non-fluorescent. \n\nWhen entering the cells, resazurin (dark blue in colour) is reduced to resorufin, a \n\ncompound that is red in colour and highly fluorescent. The cells with viability will \n\n\n\n42 Chapter 3 \u2013 Materials and Methods \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ncontinuously convert resazurin to resorufin, increasing the overall fluorescence and colour \n\nof the media surrounding the cells. The fluorescent or colorimetric signal generated from \n\nthe test corresponds to the number of living cells in the sample. Then, by fluorometric or \n\nlight absorption measurement, the amount of dye conversion in the solution is measured. \n\nTo avoid measuring cells attached to the well surface, scaffolds were transferred to a \n\nnew 24 well plate. Then, a 10% (v/v) of resazurin solution (0.1 mg/mL in PBS) with \n\nmedium was added to each well and incubated at 37\u00b0C between 1-5 h. Afterwards 100 \u00b5L \n\nper well was transferred to a 96-well plate and absorbance was measured at 570 nm and \n\n600 nm using a microplate reader. The absorbance deduced for all the cell-seeded \n\nscaffolds was a result of the ratio optical density (OD.) 570/OD. 600 nm minus the OD. \n\n570/OD. 600 nm ratio of a blank (resazurin media incubated in the absence of cells) and \n\nminus the OD. 570/OD. 600 nm ratio of a negative control (resazurin media incubated with \n\nthe control scaffold). \n\n \n\n3.4.5.  Cell morphology visualization through SEM \n\nAs a complementary test to the visualization of cells done with the staining described in \n\nsection 3.4.3, cell morphology visualization through SEM was made. This test was made \n\nto the superficial zone at the end of three weeks. \n\nAt the end of three weeks of culture in a 24 well culture plate, the chondrocyte seeded \n\n(0,5 x 10\n6 \n\ncells/well) superficial zone was washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% \n\nparaformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 minutes, and dehydrated through a gradient series of \n\nethanol from 70% to 100% and dried. Prior to SEM (Hitachi SU 70; Hitachi High-\n\nTechnologies Corporation, Krefeld, F.R., Germany) analysis, the samples were fixed with \n\ncarbon tape (Emitech K950 equipment) on the specific support for SEM and suffered \n\nsputter coating with gold (Au) in order to be analysed.  \n\n \n\n3.4.6.  Statistical Analysis \n\nThe values expressed for the resazurin measurement correspond to the mean \u00b1 \n\nstandard deviation of five samples. The analysis of the ANOVA multiple values were used \n\nfor the statistical analysis of the results in ORIGIN with the combination of the Turkey test. \n\nThe value p<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\nChapter 4  \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n \n\n4.1.  Optimization of Fibrous Structure Porosity \n\nAs previously described (section 3.2) the PCL electrospun fibres for the superficial and \n\ndeep zones had a diameter of 1.2\u00b10.5 \u00b5m and an average pore size of 2.6 \u00b1 1.9 \u00b5m. \n\nWhile the middle zone had a diameter 2.2 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5m and an average pore size 9.0 \u00b1 4.4 \n\n\u00b5m. With the intention of optimizing the porosity and consequently enhancing cell \n\nmigration and proliferation, a variation to the velocity of the rotating collector device and \n\nthe horizontal velocity of the deposition needle were implemented for the fibres to be used \n\nas superficial and deep zones. For the middle zone, the horizontal velocity of the \n\ndeposition needle was the only variable altered. \n\n4.1.1.  Optimization of Superficial and Deep Zones \n\nWhen referring to the effect of RPM in the characteristics of the electrospun fibres \n\n(Figure 18) it is perceptible that the increasing of the collector velocity is directly \n\nproportional to the decreasing of the fibre diameter (50 RPM: 2.1 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5m; 250 RPM: 2.0 \n\n\u00b1 0.4 \u00b5m; 2500 RPM: 1.1 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b5m) and also in an increase of the number of pores with \n\nsize&lt;5 \u00b5m. Indeed it was expected that with a higher RPM, the fibres would have a \n\nbigger degree of alignment and therefore a smaller pore size when compared to lower \n\nRPM. The decisive aspect for choosing between 50 and 250 RPM was that, despite the \n\nslight difference between the produced fibres, at 250 RPM it was observed that the \n\nelectrospun meshes had a bigger percentage of pores >10 \u00b5m making it more suitable for \n\ncell proliferation. \n\n\n\n44 Chapter 4 \u2013 Results and Discussion \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 18 - Influence of the rotating collector device velocity on the topography of the \n\nelectrospun meshes.

On the other hand at a lower velocity \n\n(1 mm/s) it is noticeable a bigger percentage of small pores (<5 \u00b5m), while the biggest \n\npercentage of big pores (>10 \u00b5m) was acquired at an intermediate velocity (5 mm/s). This \n\nresult is justifiable with the fact that at this velocity it is possible to have a better \n\ndistribution of fibres in the collector, avoiding the overlap of fibres registered at the lowest \n\nand highest velocity.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Results and Discussion 45 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 19 - Influence of needle horizontal velocity on the topography of the electrospun \n\nmeshes.

In fact, when comparing the initial fibres (fibre diameter 1.2 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b5m and an \n\naverage pore size of 2.6 \u00b1 1.9 \u00b5m.) with the ones produced in these conditions, it was \n\nacquired fibres with 1.3 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5m and an average pore size of 6.3 \u00b1 1.9 \u00b5m, presenting \n\naround 85% of its pores equal or bigger than 5 \u00b5m.

Optimization of Middle Zone \n\nThe horizontal velocity of the deposition needle was the only variable that was changed \n\nfor the middle zone while trying to improve its porosity.

Although at a spinneret velocity of \n\n10 mm/s the fibres had a bigger percentage of pores with size >10 \u00b5m, the manual \n\nmanipulation of the sample/fibres made it hard to collect fibres without damaging them. \n\nThe percentage of pores with size&lt;5 \u00b5m was almost the same throughout all the \n\nvariations of speed. For these reasons it was chosen the 0 mm/s spinneret velocity which \n\nmade the manipulation of the fibres easy and had a significant percentage of pores with \n\nsize >10 \u00b5m.

Mechanical and Topographic Analysis \n\nAs described in section 3.3, all the different electrospun zones (superficial, middle and \n\ndeep) together with the four architectures were studied with the purpose of evaluating in \n\nwhich way the modifications in the fibres alignment and final depth dependent structure \n\ninfluenced the mechanical properties and therefore could impact the cellular response. In \n\nfact, the different anisotropic architectures had distinct mechanical properties due to their \n\ndifferent topography. As expected it was possible to determinate the compressive moduli \n\nof each individual zone by calculating the slope of the typical linear region of the stress-\n\nstrain curves (Figure 22a) [68\u201370]. Their respective compressive moduli and the \n\nsuperficial zone Young\u2019s modulus are presented in Table 3. The deep zone presents a \n\nlower R\n2\n (0.98 \u00b1 0.01) than the other two electrospun zones (R\n\n2\n superficial = 0.982 \u00b1 \n\n0.004 and R\n2\n middle = 0.982 \u00b1 0.008) probably due to the fact that the fibrous branches of \n\n\n\n48 Chapter 4 \u2013 Results and Discussion \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthe spiral are intercalated by a heterogeneous microporous GO-collagen network (Figure \n\n23) [67]. It was considered 15% of strain in the three zones for the calculation of the \n\ncompressive modulus because for all samples R\n2\n > 0.95 [2] and due to the fact that it was \n\nthe limit of deformation from that the scaffolds totally recovered their initial height, which is \n\na value compatible with the physiological properties of the native cartilaginous tissue \n\n[71,72]. \n\nIn Figure 22b it is possible to compare the compressive moduli of all the three different \n\nzones. It can be concluded that the deep zone has the highest compressive modulus \n\n(164.46 \u00b1 24.11 kPa) when compared to the other two zones (superficial = 27.33 \u00b1 3.42 \n\nkPa and middle = 24.53 \u00b1 8.49 kPa). This could be explained by the fact that, like in the \n\nnatural cartilage, the deep zone presents fibres that are orientated vertically which could \n\noffer more resistance to the applied load. Also, if we compare to the natural cartilage, the \n\ndeep zone is likewise the one which presents a higher compressive modulus [11]. When \n\ncomparing the superficial and middle zone, they offer no significant difference between \n\nthemselves. They do represent a lower compressive value when compared to Kim et al. \n\n[73] fibres which had a compressive modulus of 80 \u00b1 20 kPa. The difference could be due \n\nto the fact that in this work it was used a flow rate of 1 mL/h and 30 s time of deposition, \n\nwhilst Kim et al. used a flow rate of 2 mL/h and 10 minutes of deposition time, having a \n\nmore dense final structure and enhancing its mechanical properties when compared to the \n\nones in this study. \n\nFigure 22c shows a representative tensile stress-strain curve (R\n2 \n\n= 0.99) of the \n\nsuperficial zone. It showed a Young\u2019s modulus of 11.94 \u00b1 1.14 MPa that, when compared \n\nto several bibliography showed to have a higher Young\u2019s modulus (3.7 MPa of 13% PCL \n\n[74]; 3.8 \u00b1 0.8 MPa of 15% PCL [75]; 4.98 MPa of 10% PCL [52]). This could be explained \n\nby the rotation applied by the collector (at 1500 RPM), that the referred examples did not \n\nhave (they were stationary). Indeed, the effect of the collectors velocity results in a better \n\nhorizontal alignment of the fibres (and reduced pore size), which had the same direction \n\nas the force applied in the mechanical testing, culminating in an increased tensile \n\nmodulus. For example, Thomas et al. [76] proved that a bigger rotation velocity of the \n\ncollector improved the average tensile strength from 2.21 \u00b1 0.22 MPa, at 0 RPM to 9.58 \u00b1 \n\n0.71 MPa at 6000 RPM. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Results and Discussion 49 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 22 \u2013Mechanical properties of the electrospun zones.

When studying the compressive modulus of the scaffolds \n\n(Figure 24) it was observable that the architecture H1 (superficial+middle+deep = 38.07 \u00b1 \n\n4.48 kPa) conferred a similar compressive modulus to the one of H2 (superficial+middle = \n\n38.90 \u00b1 3.06 kPa). One possible explanation for this is that the deep zone (that is \n\npresented in H1) has a compressive modulus that is much superior when compared to the \n\nother zones and therefore suffering less deformation. And since the deformation is only \n\napplied until 15%, it is not enough to see the mechanical response of the deep zone. For \n\nthis reason, the compressive moduli of H1 and H2 are similar at 15% because essentially \n\nonly represent the effect of the superficial and middle zone. This result reveals that the \n\nconnection between the three zones in H1 must be optimized in order that the \n\ncompressive modulus is not only affected by the superficial and middle zone, but by the \n\nthree zones. One possible strategy is to establish chemical bonds between the PCL fibres \n\nof the three zones. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Results and Discussion 51 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIt is possible to conclude that the deep zone plays a key role in both the mechanical \n\nand swelling behaviour of the scaffolds. In fact, the architectures where the presence of \n\nthe deep zone is more significant (H3 and H4 - 50% of the total high) present higher \n\ncompressive moduli relatively to the other scaffolds (40% in H1 and 0% in H2). One \n\npossible explanation for the considerable difference between the compressive moduli of \n\nH4 (86.27 \u00b111.94 kPa) and H3 (60.12 \u00b111.31 kPa), which is surprising since the \n\nsuperficial and middle zones present similar compressive moduli, can be related with the \n\nsuperior swelling ability of the scaffold H4. In other words, as the middle and deep zones \n\npresent respectively a larger fibre-fibre distance and a GO-collagen microporous network \n\nintercalated with fibrous branches, the scaffold H4 is more capable of retaining water \n\ncomparatively with the scaffold H3, which in contrast presents a significant superficial \n\nzone with smaller pores. Consequently, it is possible that the larger amount of retained \n\nwater contributes to a more efficient zone-zone assembly during the freezing process \n\n(Figure 15) and therefore to a more compact 3D structure.  \n\nWhen comparing the scaffolds compressive moduli values with the ones from natural \n\narticular cartilage, we can see that the scaffolds have lower compressive moduli since the \n\nnatural cartilage, depending on the zone, could have compressive moduli of 1-19.5 Mpa \n\n[11,77]. This in turn has advantages and disadvantages. In one side, the inferior \n\nmechanical properties if meant to only promote initial engineered tissue growth in vitro, \n\nthey don\u2019t require the level of mechanical strength of the natural cartilage. Since the \n\nscaffold will be meant to act as a supportive environment to help maintain the phenotype \n\nof the chondrocytes (which could be proved difficult) and therefore promote the formation \n\nof new tissue/ECM that then should withstand the same mechanical characteristics of the \n\nnatural cartilage [78,79]. On the other hand, low mechanical properties could be directly \n\naffected by the degradation rate of the scaffold (the rate of scaffold degradation should be \n\nproportional to the rate of tissue formation to ensure sufficient mechanical support) [79]. \n\nAs a solution, the implementation of mechanical stimuli through the use of a bioreactor, \n\nhas been showed to improve the mechanical properties by increasing cell proliferation and \n\nECM production guaranteeing the anisotropic distribution of collagen in engineered \n\ncartilage [24].  \n\nThe swelling ratio showed no significant difference between the different architectures, \n\nproving that their capacity to retain water is slightly affected by the difference between the \n\narchitectures (with the exception of H4 as previously described). The main influence in the \n\nswelling of the different architectures is probably due to the porous structure of the GO-\n\ncollagen that is part of the final scaffold. Since PCL is a hydrophobic in its essence, the \n\n\n\n52 Chapter 4 \u2013 Results and Discussion \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nretained water is mainly accomplished by the GO present in the scaffold that by nature \n\nhas a high potential to store and adsorb water molecules due to the oxygen-containing \n\nfunctional groups on its hydrophilic surface [80\u201382]. \n\n \n\nFigure 24 - Compressive modulus (blue) and sweeling after 24h (red) of the different PCL-\n\nGO-collagen scaffolds \n\n \n\nTable 4 - Compressive Modulus and Swelling ratio of the different architectures \n\nArchitecture Compressive Modulus (kPa) Swelling ratio \n\nH1 38.07 \u00b1 4.48 19.71 \u00b1 0.41 \n\nH2 38.90 \u00b1 3.06 17.11 \u00b1 1.25 \n\nH3 60.12 \u00b1 11.31 18.03 \u00b1 2.75 \n\nH4 86.27 \u00b1 11.94 23.22 \u00b1 2.71 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Results and Discussion 53 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3.   Biocompatibility Testing \n\nIn order to characterize the scaffolds for their capability to sustain an environment for \n\ncells it was required the visualization of the cells nuclei and cytoskeleton through the \n\nstaining of actin filaments, the SEM visualization of the cells presence in the superficial \n\nzone and the measurement of their metabolic activity. \n\n4.3.1.  Cytochemical Staining of Actin Filaments and Nuclei \n\nThe actin present in the cytoskeleton is determinant for chondrocyte shape which \n\ninfluences chondrogenic differentiation and ECM production, and it is by itself a signal for \n\nthe presence of cells in the scaffolds [83]. To analyse the presence of the cells in the three \n\ndifferent zones a cytochemical staining of actin filaments and nuclei was made. The \n\nimages (Figure 25) were taken with a fluorescence microscope after 1and 2 weeks of \n\nculture.  \n\nThe superficial zone revealed to be suitable for cells because it shows a large quantity \n\nof cells (nucleus in blue and the filaments in green) in its surface both at 1 and 2 weeks \n\nwith no significant differences through time. This could be because the superficial zone is \n\nmainly 2D and in general way, 2D cultures are very suitable for all kind of cells, including \n\nchondrocytes. But the 2D kind of structure could also have limitations. If the cells don\u2019t \n\ninfiltrate the scaffold and remain in a 2D structure they could: a) not provide the ECM \n\nstructure of natural cartilage which is depth-dependent; b) make the chondrocytes lose \n\ntheir phenotype since it isn\u2019t taken to account the 3D natural cartilage structure and \n\ndedifferentiate into a fibroblastic-like morphology of chondrocytes that would lead to \n\ndecreased ECM production, up regulation of collagen type I gene expression and down \n\nregulation of collagen type II gene expression [84\u201387]. \n\nAt the first week, the middle zone presented big adherence for the cells since it is very \n\nnoticeable their presence in its structure. But by the second week this changed drastically \n\nhas it isn\u2019t possible to see a single cell in the structure. Some reasons can be pointed out \n\nfor this result. The first is the manipulation of the samples by itself, as it was required to \n\nchange the samples from well at the end of 1 week, which in turn could force the \n\ndetachment of cells or a simple unnoticed error committed that could have killed the cells. \n\nAnother one is the variability of the samples, since the manufacturing of the middle zone \n\ndidn\u2019t allow complete control of the sample size as well as pore size. Chondrocyte size is \n\ndifficult to define since they have a big variation in volume when in hydration state and \n\ncould have cytoplasmatic processes of&lt;8 \u00b5m [88]. Some report that chondrocyte size is \n\n\n\n54 Chapter 4 \u2013 Results and Discussion \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\naround 10-12 \u00b5m and that could get as large as 40 \u00b5m ([89]), others report 20 \u00b5m ([90]) \n\nand in more recent studies of osmolarity it was registered a cell volume of ~597 \u00b5m\n3 \n([88]). \n\nBecause of this big variability in chondrocyte size and volume, and their response to \n\nhydration, and since the middle zone has a pore of 9.00\u00b14.44 \u00b5m, the cells could have \n\nsimply not had space to grow and infiltrate in the middle zone structure and detach from \n\nthe structure and therefore not being visible. \n\n 1\nst\n week 2\n\nnd\n week  \n\nSuperficial \n\n  \n\n \n\nMiddle \n\n  \n\n \n\nDeep \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 25 - Images taken with a fluorescent microscope with staining for actin filaments \n\n(green) and nuclei (blue) of the superficial, middle and deep zone after 1 and 2 weeks. \n\n \n\nThe deep zone presented a difficult structure to evaluate since it isn\u2019t possible to \n\ndetermine the presence of cells at the seventh day due to a problem of autofluorescence. \n\nAutofluorescence is when the material emits fluorescence signals that are difficult to be \n\ndistinguished from the emitted signals of externally added fluorescence markers [91]. PCL \n\nis by itself autofluorescent, but comparing to the other zones pictures, it doesn\u2019t have a big \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Results and Discussion 55 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\neffect since it is still possible to see the cells. In the case of the deep zone, the problem \n\nstands with the GO. GO is an autofluorescent material, showing its autofluorescence \n\nthrough a big part of the emission spectrum: near-infrared, visible and ultraviolet [92,93]. A \n\nway to address this problem is to stain the samples with a labelling dye that has an \n\nexcitation wavelength outside of the excitation spectrum of autofluorescent GO [91]. As \n\nthe same problem would repeat itself at week 2, it was decided not to take the picture of \n\nthe respective day. \n\n \n\n4.3.2.  Metabolic Activity Measurement \n\nThe metabolic activity of cells cultured in scaffolds and under control conditions was \n\nevaluated by the resazurin metabolism assay. The cells, when metabolically active, \n\ninduce the reduction of resazurin to resafurin, inducing a chemical change from blue to a \n\nred colour. The metabolically active and proliferating viable cells will be proportionate to \n\nthe resazurin reduction obtained [94,95]. It is a precise, simple and quick method which is \n\nnon-cytotoxic and does not require the death of cells, making them viable for reuse for \n\nfurther investigations [94,96]. The results are shown in Figure 26 for the metabolic activity \n\nafter 1 week, 2 weeks and 3 weeks. \n\nIn the first week, the superficial zone was the one that showed more metabolic activity \n\nand therefore had more cells residing in its structure when comparing to the others. This is \n\nprobably due to the already explained fact of the 2D structure of the superficial zone, \n\nwhich is excellent for cell proliferation. The middle zone is the second to present high \n\nmetabolic activity, followed by the deep zone and the GO-Collagen scaffold. The GO-\n\nCollagen scaffold presented a low value probably due to the special characteristic of GO. \n\nGO biocompatibility is very dose-dependent, as well as dependent from its \n\nphysicochemical properties (size, surface charge, particulate state, surface functional \n\ngroups and residual precursors), influencing the biological/toxicological activity [97,98]. It \n\nhas been demonstrated by Wang et al. [97] that below 20 \u00b5g/mL GO had low cytotoxicity \n\nand that above 50 \u00b5g/mL it showed to be cytotoxic, leading to low survival rate, inducing \n\ncells to float and cell apoptosis and even providing organ failure and turning deadly when \n\ninjected in mice at certain doses. This effect was increased as the time passed, causing \n\nincreased cytotoxicity and leading to more apoptosis. It was registered that GO could \n\ninternalize the cells to its nucleus, disturbing cell metabolism and gene expression by \n\ncreating reactive oxygen species (ROS) [97\u201399]. For these reasons, the GO-Collagen \n\nscaffold probably presented less affinity for cells. Another explanation for these low values \n\n\n\n56 Chapter 4 \u2013 Results and Discussion \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ncould be the loss of structural stability of the GO-Collagen scaffold due to its degradation \n\nproving its highly dispersible characteristic in media due to the presence of oxygenated \n\nfunctional groups [99], that perhaps leads to cell detachment. This effect could be \n\nexacerbated by the scaffold manipulation during culture time. This behaviour can be also \n\nobserved in the deep zone because it also contains GO-Collagen in its structure for \n\nmaintaining its form. \n\nIn a general way it is possible to see that for the superficial and middle zone there is a \n\nslight decrease in metabolic activity throughout the weeks [the value verified for the \n\nmiddle zone at the third week is significantly lower than the values at the first and second \n\nweek; the value verified for the superficial zone at the first week is significantly higher than \n\nthe other values verified at the second and third week; according to the statistical \n\nanalysis], possibly due to PCL current physical structure (pore size and distribution and \n\nfibre size) or for its chemical structure (making it hydrophobic) they could start to detach \n\nand adhere to the well surface or start dying at some point in time. A solution for this could \n\nbe the functionalization of PCL with other substances (for example adhesion proteins) or \n\nmaterials (other polymers) to increase cell adhesion [100]. \n\nAlthough the middle zone visually presents higher metabolic activity than the superficial \n\nzone at the second week, the difference is not statistically significant. This gets in conflict \n\nwith the results from the cytochemical staining obtained in this study, where we can see \n\nthat there is no presence of cells in the second week in contrast to the superficial zone. \n\nThis only reveals the big variability of the samples, which could make some samples more \n\nsuitable as an environment for cell proliferation then others.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2013 Results and Discussion 57 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 26 - Metabolic activity of the cells in three different zones (superficial = green, middle \n\n= red and deep = blue) and as control a GO-Collagen scaffold.

Cell morphology visualization through SEM \n\nAs a parallel test to the staining of the actin and nuclei of the chondrocytes, it was \n\nproceeded a visualization of the cells morphology in the superficial zone using SEM.

They appear to be flattened and have their cytoplasmatic \n\nprojections prolonging the cells body. This proves that the superficial zones were capable \n\nof sustaining cells after that period of time, and maintain a typical cell morphology [101]. \n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n1 2 3\n\nO\np\n\nti\nca\n\nl \nd\n\ne\nn\n\nsi\nty\n\n \n\nCulture time (weeks) \n\nMiddle Layer Superficial Layer\n\nDeep Layer GO-Col\n\n* \n\n* \n\n\n\n58 Chapter 4 \u2013 Results and Discussion \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 27 \u2013 Morphology visualization of chondrocytes cells in the superficial zone using \n\nSEM.

Conclusions and Future Work \n\nAs initially intended, the optimization of the pore size for the three different zones was \n\naccomplished. For the superficial and deep zone the optimization led to a bigger \n\npercentage of pores with diameter superior than 10 \u00b5m. The middle zone optimization \n\nrevealed that the previous electrospinning procedure (with the spinneret in static position) \n\nwas the one to choose because it showed suitable pores and the final 3D electrospun \n\nzone was easier to manipulate when compare to the other options (spinneret velocity of 1 \n\nmm/s and 10 mm/s).  \n\nIn the same way, the construction of four different anisotropic structures was \n\nsuccessful and the mechanical tests revealed that the deep zone presented a higher \n\ncompressive modulus when compared to the other two zones, which goes in agreement \n\nwith the mechanical properties of natural cartilage. Indeed, the scaffolds that presented \n\ndeep zones in their fibrous architectures had higher compressive modulus. The \n\ncompressive modulus of the scaffolds is also influenced by the presence of the GO-\n\ncollagen porous network due to its capacity to retain water. Although the mechanical \n\nfeatures of all the PCL-GO-collagen scaffolds presented values compatible with cartilage \n\ntissue engineering protocols, it was also suggested that the deformation applied to the \n\nscaffold is sometimes not uniform, which requires consequently a way to connect the \n\nseveral zones of the scaffolds through PCL. One solution could be to establish chemical \n\nbonds between the zones of electrospun PCL. The scaffolds showed less mechanical \n\nproperties than the natural cartilage which is somehow beneficial if it is only intended to \n\nseed the cells and have them proliferate and produce ECM. Additionally, the \n\nimplementation of mechanical stimulation during cell culture could theoretically improve \n\nthe mechanical properties of the scaffold. \n\nAlthough having good results in a general way, the manipulation of the different zones \n\nthat make up the scaffold are yet to be optimized since apparently they don\u2019t allow the \n\n\n\n60 Chapter 5 \u2013 Conclusions and Future Work \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nchondrocytes cell culture to run in an efficient way. The seeding technique should also be \n\noptimized in order to enhance the contact between the cells and the scaffold \n\nAs it was observed, the superficial zone presented the best results in terms of cell \n\nproliferation and adhesion, but the pore size was still insufficient for allowing cellular \n\nmigration, which is also noticeable in the other two zones. As a result of that, there is a \n\nneed to optimize the fibrous structure porosity in order to have a pore size that could \n\nprovide cellular migration and infiltration in the structure of the scaffolds in order for them \n\nto be functional. The preliminary biocompatibility evaluation shows high dependence on \n\nthe optimization of the different zones in order to improve the accomplished results, \n\nthrough possible optimization of pores size and/or functionalization of the PCL with \n\nsubstances like adhesion proteins, in order to have more cells proliferating and thriving in \n\nthe structure. If the cells have conditions to seed in a satisfying way and are able to \n\nproliferate and produce ECM, they will contribute for the maintenance and a better \n\nmimicking of the natural articular cartilage like microenvironment. \n\nIt should be done further degradation tests of the GO-collagen porous structure in order \n\nto evaluate if the current concentration of GO that is used in the construction of the \n\nscaffolds is causing any type of cytotoxicity for the cells.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n61 \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\n[1] T.J.

In fact, and regarding this last topic, graphene based materials are being \n\nincreasingly used in tissue engineering (TE) applications due to their capability of combining their \n\nexcellent electrical and mechanical features with the properties of biomaterials such as polymers \n\nwith the final purpose of recreating in vitro complex 3D extracellular matrix architectures able to \n\nsupport an enhanced cellular response [1].  \n\nThus, in this work, we successfully explored the potential of the graphene oxide (GO) sheets to \n\nact as functional building blocks by using collagen as physical crosslinker. Indeed, the electrostatic \n\ninteractions between the two materials have allowed the fabrication of a self-assembled hydrogel \n\ncapable of providing a suitable porous network for both static and dynamic cell culture protocols [2]. \n\nAdditionally, and complementary to its enhanced chemical, mechanical and morphological \n\nproperties, the GO-collagen scaffold also revealed an impressive versatility since its bulk \n\ncharacteristics can be easily modified to match specific TE aims. Indeed, by either adapting its \n\nconductivity via a reduction process or modulating its topographic cues via the incorporation of a \n\n3D anisotropic Polycaprolactone (PCL) electrospun network, the GO-collagen scaffold proved to be \n\nable to mimic different cellular microenvironments such as neural and cartilage, respectively.  \n\n \n\n\n\nAnnexs 73 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 1.

Marques and \n\nAnt\u00f3nio Completo \n\n \n\nThe major challenge and also the main opportunity of cartilage tissue engineering is to \n\nrecreate in vitro the depth dependent nanostructural organization of the fibrous collagen \n\nnetwork that comprises the native cartilaginous tissue. In fact, the fibre size and \n\norientation rearrangement of the cartilage natural extracellular matrix progresses from \n\nperpendicular to the subchondral bone surface in the deepest zone, to random in the \n\nmiddle zone and to parallel in the superficial region, leading to anatomically and \n\nfunctionally complementary features that are responsible for the biochemical and \n\nmechanical properties of this tissue. Though the encouraging results of both fibrous and \n\nporous scaffolds during the past few years, none of the followed methodologies is \n\ncurrently capable of guaranteeing an optimal balance between biological features, \n\nmechanical properties and suitable topographic cues. \n\nThus, in this study, with the purpose of accurately recreating each cartilaginous zone, \n\nwe purpose a versatile design and fabrication strategy involving the combination of \n\ndifferent electrospinning set ups that are sequentially used to control the size and \n\nalignment of the Polycaprolactone (PCL) fibres towards a 3D structure. In this way, we \n\nwere able to adapt the methodology in order to develop alternative fibrous scaffolds with \n\ndistinct anisotropy properties capable of offering singular mechanical and topographic \n\ncharacteristics and therefore theoretically influence cell behaviour differentially. The \n\nmorphology of the 3D electrospun scaffolds together with their individual fibrous zones \n\nwere analysed via SEM and their mechanical properties were evaluated via static and \n\ndynamic (via a bioreactor) compressive and tensile tests.  \n\nThe results confirmed that although the mechanical and swelling properties of the \n\nelectrospun scaffolds are related with the specific anisotropic organization used in each \n\ndesign, all the scaffolds show compatible features for cartilage cell culture protocols and \n\ntherefore the potential of being used as alternative enhanced cellular microenvironments \n\ncapable of promoting cartilage regeneration using different pathways.     \n\n\n\nAnnexs 75 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThis work was supported by the funding of Program COMPETE-FEDER, Programa Operacional \nCompetitividade e Internacionaliza\u00e7\u00e3o through the project POCI-01-0145-FEDER-016574 and by \nFunda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ciencia e Tecologia I.P.

Marques \n\nTissue engineering (TE) strategies for repairing and regenerating articular cartilage \n\nface critical challenges to approximate the biochemical and biomechanical \n\nmicroenvironment of native tissues. The major challenge of TE cartilage is to mimic their \n\nmechanical properties to the native ones. The importance of the arcade-like collagen \n\nstructure for the load-bearing properties in native cartilage is well emphasized in literature, \n\nbut few studies have assessed the importance of collagen fibril depth-orientation on the \n\nmechanical properties of engineered-cartilage. To generate spatially-varying properties \n\ninto TE-cartilage scaffolds, several combined cell-scaffold methods have been reported. \n\nElectrospinning allows the formation of arrays of aligned and random polymer-based \n\nnanofibers mats that can be assembled to mimic the structure of the native cartilaginous \n\nextracellular matrix. Mechanical stimulation can also be performed in order to create an \n\nanisotropic distribution of collagen in engineered-cartilage. Thus, a new series of \n\nanisotropic fibrous/porous electrospun scaffolds of polycaprolactone/collagen/graphene \n\nwere developed and their biocompatibility evaluated with and without mechanical \n\nstimulation using a bioreactor. First, anisotropic fibrous layers of PCL with depth-\n\ndependent variations in the fibrillar size and orientation were electrospun and then \n\nassembled and incorporated within a microporous graphene oxide/collagen structure. \n\nSeveral architectures were produced and tested in vitro. For this, a cartilage progenitor \n\ncell line was used and the cell metabolic activity, morphology and distribution throughout \n\nthe scaffolds were accessed. The results, both static and dynamic, revealed that the \n\nscaffolds could not only allow cells\u2019 adhesion, but also cell proliferation. Overall, \n\npolycaprolactone/collagen/graphene oxide scaffolds generated a good cellular response \n\nand were able to support cell proliferation. The effect of mechanical stimulation under \n\nphysiological conditions is discussed.
