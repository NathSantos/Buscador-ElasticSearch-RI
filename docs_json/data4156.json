Either commercial (TiO2) \n\nor synthesized (Ag, Pd and Au) nanoparticles (NP) were used \n\nand characterized by DLS and XRD. Subsequently, the \n\ndispersed NP were impregnated on bentonite by two \n\nalternative methods, imbibition or dipping. The efficiency of \n\nimpregnation of bentonite by metallic nanoparticles was tested \n\nby ICP-OES, which was over 90% in all cases. Particularly, \n\nAg nanoparticles showed an impregnation efficiency above \n\n99%, as confirmed by SEM-FEG. To improve impregnation, a \n\nthermal pretreatment for the bentonites was necessary at 700 \n\n\u00b0C. Both impregnation methods resulted in a suitable \n\ndistribution and stability of Ag nanoparticles. The second part \n\nof this work aimed to obtain porous ceramic filters for water \n\nfiltration with kaolinite and/or alumina, by pressing using rice \n\nhusk like a sacrifice agent, and by freeze-casting with water. \n\nThe powders were characterized by average particle size and \n\ndistribution, zeta potential, XRD, XRF, density by \n\npicnometry, specific surface area (BET), and SEM. \n\nParameters like viscosity, solidification rate, compression \n\nstrength, porosity and permeability were analyzed. In the \n\npressing method, samples with only kaolinite presented low \n\nporosity and low densification, while samples with only \n\nalumina have a high densification and very low porosity. The \n\nhigher porosities occurred in samples with 35 to 60 wt% water \n\nand 20 to 30 wt%  rice husk (<70 mesh). All the samples with \n\nkaolinite and alumina presented a good strength after contact \n\nwith water, with flow rate less than 0.01 l/h. In the freeze-\n\ncasting method, firstly two alumina powders (coarse and fine) \n\nwere tested with mean particle sizes of 2.5 and 0.5 \u00b5m, \n\nrespectively. As the particle size decreases, the solidification \n\nrate also decreases, so the solidification rate is higher for \n\ncoarse alumina. At around 50 wt% solids, the porosity of \n\ncoarse alumina is slightly higher than that of fine alumina, \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\naround 73 and 68%, respectively. Permeability parameters k1 \n\nand k2 show that the pellets achieved the desired values for \n\nthe application of ceramic filters for drinking water. \n\nFurthermore, coarse alumina was chosen and samples with \n\nalumina and kaolinite were produced and analyzed. Their \n\nfiltration efficiency was evaluated using Colilert and Quanti-\n\nTray/2000. Samples with coarse alumina and kaolinite \n\nreached best results of compression strength with the higher \n\nvalues of k1 and k2, with pores with sizes distributed \n\nhomogeneously between 1.04 and 2.73 \u00b5m. The filtrated \n\nwater presented a total number of coliforms and E. coli \n\nreaching less than a half of the minimum value allowed for \n\nanimal consumption and less than one eighth of the value \n\nallowed for recreation, with a turbidity around 0.56 NTU. The \n\nfinal filter pellets were impregnated with silver nanoparticles \n\nand the efficiency of impregnation and bactericidal effects \n\nwere tested. Silver nanoparticles were characterized by \n\naverage particle size, zeta potential and TEM. After \n\nimpregnation, the leached water was analyzed by GFAAS that \n\nshows an efficiency of more than 99% in silver impregnation. \n\nFrom SEM/EDS, it was possible to observe that the pellets \n\nhave a homogeneous distribution of silver nanoparticles. A \n\nhalo of inhibition detected by the disc diffusion test shows a \n\nstrong bactericidal effect of the filters. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Ceramic filters, pressing, freeze casting, \n\nnanoparticles, silver. \n\n  \n\nhttps://www.idexx.com/water/products/quanti-tray.html\nhttps://www.idexx.com/water/products/quanti-tray.html\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\nResumo \n \n\nA primeira parte deste trabalho teve como objetivo \n\ncaracterizar bentonitas de diferentes propriedades e origens \n\n(Brasil, Argentina, It\u00e1lia e Estados Unidos), que foram \n\nsubmetidas \u00e0 funcionaliza\u00e7\u00e3o com nanopart\u00edculas de Ag, \n\nTiO2, Pd e Au. Nanopart\u00edculas comerciais (TiO2) e \n\nsintetizadas (Ag, Pd e Au) (NP) foram utilizadas e \n\ncaracterizadas por DLS e DRX. Posteriormente, as NP \n\ndispersas foram impregnadas em bentonitas por dois m\u00e9todos \n\nalternativos, imbibi\u00e7\u00e3o ou imers\u00e3o. A efici\u00eancia da \n\nimpregna\u00e7\u00e3o das bentonitas por nanopart\u00edculas met\u00e1licas foi \n\ntestada por ICP-OES, cujo resultado foi de mais de 90% em \n\ntodos os casos. Particularmente, as nanopart\u00edculas de Ag \n\nmostraram uma efici\u00eancia de impregna\u00e7\u00e3o superior a 99%, \n\nconforme confirmado por MEV-FEG. Para melhorar a \n\nimpregna\u00e7\u00e3o, foi necess\u00e1rio um pr\u00e9-tratamento t\u00e9rmico para \n\nas bentonitas a 700 \u00b0C. Ambos os m\u00e9todos de impregna\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nresultaram em uma distribui\u00e7\u00e3o e estabilidade adequadas das \n\nnanopart\u00edculas de Ag. A segunda parte deste trabalho teve \n\ncomo objetivo obter filtros cer\u00e2micos porosos para filtra\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\n\u00e1gua, utilizando caulinita e/ou alumina, atrav\u00e9s de prensagen, \n\ncom o uso de casca de arroz como agente de sacrif\u00edcio e \n\nfreeze-casting, utilizando \u00e1gua. Os p\u00f3s foram caracterizados \n\npor distribui\u00e7\u00e3o e tamanho m\u00e9dio de part\u00edculas, potencial zeta, \n\nDRX, FRX, densidade por picnometria, \u00e1rea de superf\u00edcie \n\nespec\u00edfica (BET) e MEV. Foram analisados par\u00e2metros como \n\nviscosidade, taxa de solidifica\u00e7\u00e3o, resist\u00eancia \u00e0 compress\u00e3o, \n\nporosidade e permeabilidade. No m\u00e9todo de prensagem, \n\namostras com apenas caulinita apresentaram baixa porosidade \n\ne baixa densifica\u00e7\u00e3o, enquanto as amostras com apenas \n\nalumina possuem alta densidade e muito baixa porosidade. As \n\nporosidades mais altas ocorreram em amostras com 35 a 60% \n\nem peso de \u00e1gua e 20 a 30% em peso de casca de arroz (<70 \n\nmesh). Todas as amostras com caulinita e alumina \n\napresentaram boa resist\u00eancia mec\u00e2nica ap\u00f3s contato com \n\n\u00e1gua, com taxa de fluxo inferior a 0,01 l/h. No m\u00e9todo de \n\nfreeze-casting, primeiramente, dois p\u00f3s de alumina, com \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\ntamanhos m\u00e9dios de part\u00edculas de 2,5 e 0,5 ?m, \n\nrespectivamente, foram testados. \u00c0 medida que o tamanho de \n\npart\u00edcula diminui, a taxa de solidifica\u00e7\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m diminui, de \n\nmodo que a taxa de solidifica\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 maior para alumina de 2,5 \n\n?m. Em cerca de 50% em peso de s\u00f3lidos, a porosidade dessa \n\nalumina \u00e9 ligeiramente superior \u00e0 da alumina mais fina, \n\naproximadamente 73 e 68%, respectivamente. Os par\u00e2metros \n\nde permeabilidade k1 e k2 mostram que as pastilhas atingiram \n\nos valores desejados para a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de filtros de cer\u00e2mica \n\npara \u00e1gua pot\u00e1vel. Al\u00e9m disso, a alumina com 2,5 ?m foi \n\nescolhida, e amostras com alumina e caulinita foram \n\nproduzidas e analisadas. Sua efici\u00eancia de filtra\u00e7\u00e3o foi \n\navaliada usando Colilert e Quanti-Tray/2000. As amostras \n\ncom alumina e caulinita atingiram os melhores resultados de \n\nresist\u00eancia \u00e0 compress\u00e3o com valores maiores de k1 e k2, com \n\nporos de tamanhos entre 1,04 e 2,73 ?m, distribu\u00eddos de forma \n\nhomog\u00eanea. A \u00e1gua filtrada apresentou um n\u00famero total de \n\ncoliformes e E. coli que atingiu menos da metade do valor \n\nm\u00ednimo permitido para consumo animal e menos de um oitavo \n\ndo valor permitido para recrea\u00e7\u00e3o, com uma turbidez de cerca \n\nde 0,56 NTU. As pastilhas de filtro finais foram impregnadas \n\ncom nanopart\u00edculas de prata e a efici\u00eancia de impregna\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nefeitos bactericidas foram testados. As nanopart\u00edculas de prata \n\nforam caracterizadas pelo tamanho m\u00e9dio de part\u00edcula, \n\npotencial zeta e MET. Ap\u00f3s a impregna\u00e7\u00e3o, a \u00e1gua lixiviada \n\nfoi analisada por GFAAS que mostra uma efici\u00eancia superior \n\na 99% na impregna\u00e7\u00e3o de prata. A partir de MEV/EDS, foi \n\nposs\u00edvel observar que as pastilhas t\u00eam uma distribui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nhomog\u00eanea de nanopart\u00edculas de prata.

According to \n\nthe World Health Organization (WHO), 80% of the diseases \n\nexistent are caused by the intake of contaminated water. The \n\nrisk of microbiological contamination of water for human \n\nconsumption is the subject of many studies. The origin of \n\ncontamination is related to water collection, transfer and/or \n\nstorage (Clasen and Bastable, 2003; Lv et al., 2009; Simonis \n\nand Basson, 2011; WHO, 2006). \n\nOne of the most efficient technologies, for water \n\npurification, is the use of ceramic filters. In this work, two raw \n\nmaterials, alumina and/or kaolinite, and two shaping \n\ntechniques, respectively, pressing (with or without porogenic \n\nagents) or freeze casting were considered for manufacturing \n\nceramic filters. Pressing was chosen due to simplicity, low \n\ncost, velocity and low energy, and freeze casting was selected \n\nbecause it is a versatile fabrication technique of porous \n\nstructures, and generally offers a wider range of pore \n\ncharacteristics. \n\nFreezing casting has aroused great interest in the \n\nindustry, due to its peculiar properties that it generates. In this \n\ntechnique, many factors influence the microstructure and \n\nproperties of porous ceramics, like porosity and mechanical \n\nstrength, such as composition and initial solids loading, \n\ncooling rate, sintering temperature, and additive content \n\n(Deville, 2008; Hu et al., 2010; Liu and Button, 2013). The \n\nparticle size of the powders has an important effect on the \n\nfinal sample properties, but it has attracted little attention. \n\nThus, in this work, two alumina powders, with particle size \n\n2.5 and 0.5 \u00b5m respectively, were tested to observe the \n\ninfluence of the particle size on freeze-cast porous bodies. \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\n \n\nTo increase the efficiency in the water filtration, an \n\ninnovative approach for impregnation of porous ceramic \n\npellets was tested with silver nanoparticles in order to \n\noptimize reactive surface area and to enhance bactericidal \n\neffects. Silver is often used as an antibacterial agent, in order \n\nto provide a sanitary environment for wound healing. The \n\nmultiplicity of silver\u2019s bactericidal mechanisms gives it a wide \n\nrange of effective applications in the inhibition of bacterial \n\ngrowth. (Alexander, 2009; Nam et al., 2015; Bal et al., 2015; \n\nDong et al., 2016; Mckevica et al., 2016; Amadio et al., 2017). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\n \n\n2 Aims \n\n \n\n2.1 General aim \n\n \n\nThis work is aimed to obtain porous ceramic bodies \n\nwith clay minerals and/or alumina, to reach a suitable porosity \n\nand permeability with an acceptable compression strength, \n\nand impregnate them efficiently with silver nanoparticles for \n\nbactericidal effect. \n\n2.2 Specific aims \n\n \n\nThe specific aims follow: \n\n \n\n? To functionalize bentonites with Ag, TiO2, Pd and Au \nnanoparticles by two alternative methods, imbibition \n\nor dipping; \n\n \n\n? To manufacture pressed filters with kaolinite and/or \nalumina, with and without rice husks and water, with \n\ndifferent process parameters; \n\n \n\n? To manufacture freeze-cast filters, optimizing all the \ncompositions and parameters; \n\n \n\n? To evaluate the effect of particle size of alumina on \nprocess and product related to freeze casting; \n\n \n\n? To test the freeze-cast filter efficiency and the \ncharacteristics of the filtrated water; \n\n \n\n? To test the efficiency of silver-nanoparticle \nimpregnated filters in terms of their bactericidal \n\neffect. \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\n3 Literature review \n\n \n\n3.1 Water treatment  \n\n \n\nThe access to clean and safe water is of paramount \n\nimportance for human health. It is estimated that in the 21st \n\ncentury more than one billion people will not have access to \n\nsafe drinking water. Much of this population is concentrated \n\nin underdeveloped countries, especially in rural areas. Small \n\ncommunities have the most difficulty in receiving water in \n\nsufficient quantity and quality, the lack of maintenance and \n\nexpansion of reservoirs coupled with the lack of supply and \n\nnon-compliance with standards that define the water quality \n\nstandard are some of the reasons why the population is \n\nexposed to diseases transmitted through the water (Mwabi et \n\nal., 2011). \n\nIt is estimated that 4% of all deaths worldwide results \n\nfrom diarrhea caused by pathogenic bacteria present in waters \n\nconsidered unfit for human consumption. In South Africa, for \n\nexample, diarrhea is responsible for 11% of the deaths of \n\nchildren under 5 years of age, in developing countries this \n\nnumber is even more significant increasing to 21%. According \n\nto the World Health Organization (WHO), 80% of the \n\ndiseases existents are caused by the intake of contaminated \n\nwater, the recommendation is that the water for human \n\nconsumption contains a quantity of total coliforms \n\ncorresponding to 0 in a 100 ml sample. The risk of \n\nmicrobiological contamination of water for human \n\nconsumption is the subject of many studies. There is constant \n\ncontamination during water collection, transfer and storage \n\n(Clasen and Bastable, 2003; Lv et al., 2009; Simonis and \n\nBasson, 2011; WHO, 2006).  \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\n \n\nThere are many technologies for home water treatment \n\nand some of them are the subject of research in laboratories to \n\nevaluate the effectiveness in reducing pathogens and diseases \n\nsuch as diarrhea. One of the most efficient technologies is the \n\nmanufacture of ceramic filters, which act efficiently as a \n\nbarrier against pathogenic organisms. Disk filters produced by \n\nthe organization Potters for Peace achieved expressive results \n\nas the reduction of 97.8% of Escherichia coli (Brown and \n\nSobsey, 2010). \n\nStudies with 37 different water treatments indicate that \n\nceramic water filters are among the five most effective \n\ntreatments for turbidity reduction and a 99% reduction of \n\nbacteria in the laboratory, but this value becomes lower in \n\nfield conditions. In developing countries household-scale \n\nceramic filters are being used as a better treatment option for \n\nboth unpurified and insufficiently disinfected water in \n\nhouseholds (Lantagne, 2001; Clasen and Boisson, 2006; \n\nSimonis and Basson, 2011). \n\nIn a report of the WHO Commission on Health and \n\nEnvironment (undated), three mechanisms of transmittal for \n\nwaterborne diseases are described (Lantagne, 2001): \n\n \n\n? Waterborne diseases \n\nThese arise from the contamination of water by \n\nhuman or animal feces or urine infected by pathogenic viruses \n\nor bacteria, which are directly transmitted when the water is \n\ndrunk or used in the preparation of food. \n\n? Water-washed diseases \n\nScarcity and inaccessibility of water make washing \n\nand personal cleanliness difficult and infrequent. Where this is \n\nso some diarrheal diseases and contagious skin and eye \n\ninfections are prevalent. All waterborne diseases can also be \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\n \n\nwater-washed diseases.  Water-washed diseases diminish \n\nwhenever an adequate supply of water is available and used. \n\n? Water-based diseases \n\nWater provides the habitat for intermediate host \n\norganisms in which some parasites pass part of their life cycle. \n\nIn addition, the WHO detailed the public health impact \n\nworldwide of waterborne diseases (Table 1). A number of \n\ndiseases have not yet had morbidity, mortality, and population \n\nat risk statistics developed, however, the statistics that have \n\nbeen enumerated show that a significant fraction of the world \n\npopulation is both at risk for, and contracts, waterborne \n\ndiseases (Lantagne, 2001). \n\n \n\nTable 1. Worldwide public health impact of waterborne \n\ndisease (WHO, undated; Lantagne, 2001). \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\n \n\nThus, a number of different organisms of varying size \n\nand pathology contribute to waterborne disease throughout the \n\nworld. Two mechanisms in the Potters for Peace (PFP) filter \n\ncontribute to reduction of these organisms (Lantagne, 2001): \n\n? The first mechanism is filtration. The PFP filter will \ntrap any particle or organism that is larger than the \n\npore size of the filter. The pore size in the filter ranges \n\nare from 0.6 to 3.0 \u00b5m, PFP aims to have a pore size \n\nof 1 ?m to remove E. coli without the need for a \n\ndisinfectant. This would trap a significant portion of \n\nbacteria, and all protozoa and helminthes. However, \n\nviruses are smaller than 1 ?m, and thus would not be \n\ntrapped. The variation in pore size is due to the \n\nlocation of sawdust during burning. If the pore size is \n\nmaintained at a maximum of three microns, it is \n\nexpected that the PFP filter will remove a significant \n\npercentage of these protozoa (Lantagne, 2001). \n\n? The second mechanism is inactivation, in which \ncolloidal silver is used in the PFP filter against \n\norganisms contributing to waterborne disease \n\n(Lantagne, 2001). \n\n \n\n3.2 Ceramic filters \n\nIn recent years, ceramic filters have been widely used \n\nfor microbiological treatment of water due to its low cost. \n\nPorous ceramics are manufactured from refractory oxides \n\nsuch as alumina, titania, zirconia. Briefly, the advantages of \n\nporous ceramics over other filtration techniques and materials \n\nare their chemical, thermal and pH stability, allied to the \n\nprevious features there is also the longevity and strength to \n\npressure, temperature and corrosion, bringing an excellent \n\ncost benefit (Lv et al, 2009; Bielefeldt et al, 2009). \n\nCeramic water filters (CWFs) are manufactured, for \n\nexample, by mixing clay with a pore forming agent such as \n\nsawdust or rice husk and a liquid, usually water. The filters \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\n \n\nare molded in mechanical hydraulic presses or through the \n\npotter's wheel, then they pass into the sintering process, where \n\nthe pore forming agent is eliminated as gas, leaving in the \n\nstructure small interconnected pores (Yakub and Soboyejo, \n\n2012). \n\nTwo primary mechanisms, physical removal and \n\ninactivation, are considered important in the microorganism \n\ndisinfection by CWFs. First, in physical removal mechanism, \n\nfiltration by size exclusion removes larger microorganisms \n\nsuch as protozoans and some bacteria and may be attributed to \n\nthe initial filter pore sizes, as well as the solids filter cake that \n\naccumulates inside the filter. Surface association and the \n\nsubsequent filter cake may also remove smaller bacteria and \n\nviruses (Bielefeldt et al, 2009). \n\nIn the physical removal filtering mechanism, \n\nproperties such as geometry and pore surface are of \n\nfundamental importance for the efficiency in the removal of \n\nmicroorganisms to levels indicated by the WHO. Porosity is \n\nthe most used property to describe the pores of a material, \n\nbeing defined as a fraction of the total volume occupied by \n\npores. (Yakub and Soboyejo, 2012; WHO, 2014; Youmoue et \n\nal., 2017). \n\nAdditionally, in inactivation mechanism, ionic and \n\nnanoscale silver has been shown to inactivate pathogens, \n\nincluding bacteria and to a lesser extent viruses. The silver \n\nmay inactivate pathogens that pass through the filter pores, \n\nmay limit bacterial growth in the filter itself (bacteriostatic), \n\nor exert other effects of benefit to disinfection. Several studies \n\nhave quantified the CWF removal of bacteria, such as fecal \n\ncoliform or Escherichia coli, which serve as indicators of \n\npathogenic microorganism disinfection. Laboratory studies \n\nhave reported high pathogen disinfection efficiency for the \n\nnew filters, with fresh silver coating (Brady et al., 2003; Cho \n\net al., 2005; Huang et al., 2008; Zeng et al., 2007; Bielefeldt et \n\nal, 2009). \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\n \n\nThe ceramic matrix composition is fundamental in the \n\nresulting porosity of the material, since filters constructed \n\nwith particle sizes ranging from 0.02 to 4 ?m can result in 34 \n\nto 46% porosity. Pore size and geometry have great influence \n\non porosity, interconnected pores with a size of 3 to 4 ?m tend \n\nto maximize hydraulic conductivity (Simonis and Basson et \n\nal., 2012; Youmoue et al., 2017). \n\nAccording to Yakub et al., the porosity of the filters \n\nincreases with the increase in the percentage of organic \n\nmaterial in the composition. In contrast, the mechanical \n\nstrength to compression and bending decreases with \n\nincreasing porosity; with the porosity increasing from 36 to \n\n46%, the compression strength decreases respectively from \n\napproximately 9 to 5 MPa. This decrease in compression \n\nstrength value is due to the increase in sawdust content of 25-\n\n50% in volume (Yakub and Soboyejo, 2012). \n\nFigure 1 illustrates low cost options that are being \n\npracticed in developing countries, namely the pot and disk \n\nfilter elements respectively used by Potters for Peace and \n\nFiltron systems (Simonis and Basson, 2011). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Filter elements and filter system (Simonis and \n\nBasson, 2011). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\n \n\nPorous ceramics are widely used in various versatile \n\napplications, such as liquid gas filters, catalysis supports, gas \n\ndistributors, insulators, preforms for metal-impregnated \n\nceramic metal composites, and implantable bone scaffolds \n\n(Scheffler and Colombo, 2005; Studart et al., 2006). \n\nPorous ceramics are advantageous in such application \n\nareas due to their high melting point, tailored electronic \n\nproperties, and high corrosion and wear strength, which \n\ncombine favorably with the features gained by the \n\nintroduction of voids into the solid material (Kingery et al., \n\n1975; Princen and Kiss, 1989; Colombo and Hellmann, 2002; \n\nGuzman, 2003). \n\nThese features include low thermal conductivity, \n\ncontrolled permeability, high surface area, low density, high \n\nspecific strength, and low dielectric constant. These properties \n\ncan be tailored for each specific application by controlling the \n\ncomposition and microstructure of the porous ceramic. \n\nChanges in open and closed porosity, pores size distribution, \n\nand pores morphology can greatly affect materials properties. \n\nThese microstructural features are highly influenced by the \n\nprocessing route used to produce the porous material (Binks, \n\n2002; Colombo, 2006; Murray, 2007; Horozov, 2008; \n\nNeirinck et al., 2009). \n\n3.2.1 Methods to obtain porous ceramics \n\nSeveral processing routes using replica, sacrificial \n\ntemplate, or direct foaming methods are nowadays available \n\nfor the production of macroporous ceramics. The techniques \n\ndiffer greatly in terms of processing features and final \n\nmicrostructures/properties achieved (Studart et al., 2006). \n\nFigure 2 shows the scheme of possible processing routes used \n\nfor the production of macroporous ceramics. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Processing routes used for the production of \n\nmacroporous ceramics (Studart et al., 2006). \n\n3.2.1.1 Replica \n\n \n\nThe replica method is based on the impregnation of a \n\ncellular structure with a ceramic suspension or precursor \n\nsolution in order to produce a macroporous ceramic exhibiting \n\nthe same morphology as the original porous material (Figure \n\n2a). This is followed by the removal of excess slurry, \n\npyrolysis of the polymeric substrate, and sintering to solidify \n\nthe foam. Many synthetic and natural cellular structures can \n\nbe used as templates to fabricate macroporous ceramics \n\nthrough the replica technique (Binks, 2002; Studart et al., \n\n2006). \n\nBinders and plasticizers are also added to the initial \n\nsuspension to provide ceramic coatings sufficiently strong to \n\nprevent the struts from cracking during pyrolysis. This process \n\nis explored fully elsewhere. The resulting ceramic is formed \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\n \n\nafter removal of the polymeric template (Binks, 2002; \n\nColombo, 2006, Studart et al., 2006).  \n\nThe disadvantages of this technique are in the \n\nformation of the struts of the reticulated structure during \n\npyrolysis of the polymeric template, which significantly \n\nweakens the mechanical strength of the resulting porous \n\nceramic (Subramaniam, et al., 2006). \n\nThe polymer replica technique is an easy and well-\n\nestablished method to prepare open cellular structures with \n\npore sizes ranging from 200 \u00b5m to 3 mm at porosity levels \n\nbetween 40 and 95%. A replica approach that uses wood \n\nstructures as positive templates was developed in recent years. \n\nHighly oriented open pores ranging from 10 to 300 \u00b5m can be \n\nproduced with this method at porosities between 25 and 95% \n\n(Studart et al., 2006). \n\n3.2.1.2. Sacrifical template \n\n \n\nThe sacrificial template method is flexible and can \n\nemploy various chemical compositions. Various oxides have \n\nbeen used to fabricate porous ceramics using starch particles \n\nas sacrificial templates. The sacrificial template technique \n\nusually consists of the preparation of a biphasic composite \n\ncomprising a continuous matrix of ceramic particles or \n\nceramic precursors and a dispersed sacrificial phase that is \n\ninitially homogeneously distributed throughout the matrix and \n\nis ultimately extracted to generate pores within the \n\nmicrostructure (Figure 2b). This method leads to porous \n\nmaterials displaying a negative replica of the original \n\nsacrificial template, as opposed to the positive morphology \n\nobtained from the replica technique described by Studart et al. \n\n(2006). \n\nOne of the main advantages of the sacrificial template \n\nmethod in comparison with the other fabrication routes is the \n\npossibility to deliberately tailor the porosity, pore size \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\n \n\ndistribution, and pore morphology of the final ceramic \n\ncomponent through the appropriate choice of the sacrificial \n\nmaterial. Figure 3 shows that the range of porosity and pore \n\nsizes that can be achieved with this technique is very broad \n\n(20\u201390% and 1\u2013700 \u00b5m, respectively), as they only depend \n\non the volume fraction and size of the sacrificial template \n\nused (Studart et al., 2006). \n\nThe method of the sacrificial materials extraction from \n\nthe consolidated composite depends primarily on the type of \n\npore former employed. Predominantly open pores of various \n\ndifferent morphologies can be produced with this method. \n\nThe most crucial step in this technique is the removal of the \n\nsacrificial phase by pyrolysis, evaporation, or sublimation. \n\nThese processes might involve the release of an excessive \n\namount of gases and have to be carried out at sufficiently \n\nslow rates in order to avoid cracking of the cellular structure. \n\nThe slow removal of the sacrificial phase may considerably \n\nincrease the processing time in the case of large components. \n\nThe mechanical strength of cellular structures produced with \n\nthis method is often substantially higher than that achieved \n\nwith the positive replica techniques (Aranberri et al., 2009; \n\nStudart et al., 2006). \n\n3.2.1.3. Direct foaming \n\n \n\nPorous ceramics properties are also highly influenced \n\nby their chemical compositions and microstructures, with \n\nporosity, pore morphology, and size distribution being \n\ntailored by different compositions, different physical \n\nstructures of the starting materials, and the use of different \n\namphiphiles (Aranberri  et al., 2009; Pokhrel et al., 2011; \n\nSarkar et al., 2015). \n\nIn direct foaming methods, porous materials are \n\nproduced by incorporating air into a suspension or liquid \n\nmedia, which is subsequently set in order to keep the structure \n\nof air bubbles created (Figure 2c). In most cases, the \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\n \n\nconsolidated foams are after wards sintered at high \n\ntemperatures to obtain high-strength porous ceramics. The \n\ntotal porosity of directly foamed ceramics is proportional to \n\nthe amount of gas incorporated into the suspension or liquid \n\nmedium during the foaming process. The pore size, on the \n\nother hand, is determined by the stability of the wet foam \n\nbefore setting takes place (Studart et al., 2006). \n\nDirect foaming methods offer an easy, cheap, and fast \n\nway to prepare macroporous ceramics with open or closed \n\nporosities from 40 to 97%. The pores produced with this \n\napproach result from the direct incorporation of air bubbles \n\ninto a ceramic suspension, eliminating the need for extensive \n\npyrolysis steps before sintering. The stabilization and setting \n\nof the wet foams is the decisive step in direct foaming \n\nmethods. Foams stabilized with surfactants lead to porous \n\nceramics exhibiting average pore sizes from 35 \u00b5m to 1.2 mm \n\n(Studart et al., 2006). \n\nThe high stability of the wet foams allows their direct \n\ndrying in ambient air at room temperature. However, in order \n\nto avoid cracking, the wet foams must be slightly \n\nstrengthened to overcome the capillary stresses and to avoid \n\ndifferential shrinkage within the drying foam (Pokhrel et al., \n\n2011). \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3. Typical porosity and average pore size achieved via \n\nthe replica, sacrificial templating, and direct foaming \n\nprocessing routes (Studart et al., 2006). \n\n3.2.1.4 Freeze -casting \n\n \n\nInterest in the effect of freezing on solutions and \n\nsuspensions dates back at least to the beginning of the 20th \n\ncentury, when first qualitative observations were reported by, \n\nfor example, Bobertag et al. (1908) and Lottermoser (1908). \n\nLottermoser was probably among the first who described the \n\nformation of materials with honeycomb structures upon \n\nfreezing. Bobertag et al. noted structural changes in the first \n\nfrozen, then remelted material, which are due to the expanding \n\nice crystals exerting forces on the matter, which, upon \n\nfreezing, is expelled from the liquid carrier and trapped \n\nbetween the crystals. About 50 years later, Maxwell et al. \n\n(1954) described freeze casting as we understand it today. \n\nThey reported the successful preparation of intricately shaped \n\nobjects such as turbocharger blades from an extremely thick \n\nceramic slip by casting, freezing and liquid sublimation before \n\nsintering (Wegst et al., 2010). \n\nThe growing interest for the development of ceramic \n\nparts with hierarchical porosity exhibiting high mechanical \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\n \n\nproperties led the scientific community to focus on alternative \n\nshaping techniques to substitute the conventional foaming \n\ntechnique and the use of pore former precursors. Indeed, they \n\nare quite simple to implement but the organization of the \n\nresulting porosity remains random in most of the cases \n\n(Sepulveda, 1997; Studart et al., 2006). Even if new \n\nmathematical models for their presentation of the tortuosity \n\nhave been recently given, it remains very difficult to model \n\nsuch random microstructures.  \n\nAmong the emerging techniques, freeze casting is an \n\nattractive shaping method for the fabrication of highly porous \n\nand hierarchically organized ceramic structures. It consists of \n\nfreezing generally by the bottom a ceramic slurry followed by \n\nthe sublimation of the solvent by freeze drying at both low \n\npressure and temperature (Zhang et al., 2015; Gaudillere and \n\nSerra, 2016). \n\nPorous ceramics have a wide number of applications \n\nas catalyst carrier, ceramic filter, sensor, porous electrode, \n\nbiomaterials, thermal barrier, among others. Freeze casting \n\nhas many advantages, including small processing shrinkage, \n\ncontrollable and wide porosity range, and relatively high \n\nstrength. Fukasawa et al. (2001; 2002) applied freeze casting \n\nto fabricate porous alumina and silicon nitride ceramics with \n\nunidirectionally aligned pore channels. Their work revealed \n\nthe potentiality for fabricating porous ceramics, and a great \n\ndeal of efforts has been subsequently put into practice \n\n(Deville, 2008; Hu et al., 2010). \n\nFreeze-casting has first been developed as a near net \n\nshape forming technique, yielding dense ceramics parts with \n\nfine replicate of the mold details. Any ice crystal being \n\nconverted into porosity later on in the process, introducing \n\nlarge size defects were largely unwelcome in ceramic \n\napplications. A great deal of efforts has been put in controlling \n\nor avoiding the formation of ice crystals. Only later on was it \n\nrealized that the formation and growth of ice crystals could be \n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n\n \n\na substantial benefit if properly controlled, yielding porous \n\nceramics with a very specific porosity (Lu et al., 1998; Sofie \n\nand Dogan, 2001; Deville, 2008). \n\nThus, freeze casting has received broad attention as a \n\nsimple and versatile fabrication technique of porous \n\nstructures, and generally offers a wider range of pore \n\ncharacteristics compared to other conventional fabrication \n\nmethods such as foam or wood replication, direct foaming, \n\nand gel casting. Water and camphene are the most common \n\nsolvents in freeze casting process (Deville et al., 2007; \n\nFukushima et al., 2008; Yoon et al., 2008; Li and Li, 2012). \n\nThe freeze casting of ceramic parts has the potential of \n\nbeing a simpler approach to produce complex-shaped ceramic \n\nparts. Freeze casting involves the preparation of a ceramic slip \n\nthat is poured into a mold, then frozen and subjected to \n\nsublimative drying of the solvent under vacuum. Given the \n\ninherent strength of frozen solvents, this method allows them \n\nto temporarily act as a binder to hold the part together after \n\ndemolding. This, therefore, minimizes the additive \n\nconcentration for enhanced solid purity and faster binder \n\nburnout cycles. Removal of the solvent by sublimation also \n\neliminates drying stresses and shrinkage that may lead to \n\ncracks and warping during the normal drying of a solvent-\n\nsaturated body (Sofie and Dogan, 2001). \n\nThe freezing of the ceramic slurry induces the \n\ngrowing of vertical solvent crystals along the freezing \n\ndirection and the associated ceramic particles are entrapped \n\nbetween these crystals (Figure 4). Finally, the as-obtained \n\ngreen body after solvent removal by freeze-drying is sintered \n\nfor consolidation and the final freeze-cast sample exhibits \n\nhierarchically and vertically aligned porosity, which is the \n\nreplica of the original solvent crystals (Gaudillere and Serra, \n\n2016). \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4. Sketch of the growing of ice crystals during the \n\nfreezing step and the associated distribution of ceramic \n\nparticles between the ice crystals (Gaudillere and Serra, 2016). \n\nThe control of pore structure is performed through \n\ncomposition and solid loading of slurry, as well as sintering \n\nconditions, which influence the microstructure and properties \n\nof porous ceramics fabricated by freeze casting (Hu et al., \n\n2010). \n\nFigure 5 shows the schematic representation of a \n\nfreeze casting system and pore structure formation during \n\nfreeze casting (Hu et al., 2010). \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5. Schematic illustration of freeze casting system and \n\npore structure formation during freeze casting (Hu et al., \n\n2010). \n\nAccording to Deville, the process can be divided into \n\nfour steps (Figure 8), and the corresponding experimental \n\nconditions will strongly depend on the chosen solvent.  \n\na) Preparation of the slurry \n\n \n\nThe ceramic powder must be correctly dispersed in \n\nthe liquid medium (the solvent), so that dispersant and \n\nplasticizer are often used. The temperature of the slurry must \n\nfall in the range where the solvent is liquid, room temperature \n\nin the case of water, but different temperatures (60 \u00b0C and 8 \n\n\u00b0C) are necessary for respectively camphene-based and tert-\n\nbutyl alcohol slurries. Moderate solid loading is used (10\u201340 \n\nvol%), depending of the desired amount of total porosity. The \n\nstability of the suspension must be carefully controlled to \n\navoid any segregation taking place in the second stage, \n\nyielding gradients of density and porosity in the final \n\nmaterials. This can be particularly problematic for low solid \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\n \n\nloadings. Finally, the presence of a binder is necessary, to \n\nprovide green strength after sublimation. Though the solvent \n\nis playing the role of the structuring agent, binder and pore \n\nforming agent, it is nevertheless removed during the \n\nsublimation stage, so that green bodies collapse in absence of \n\nan organic binder (Deville, 2008). \n\nCeramic slurries for freeze casting are typically \n\ncomposed of micro or nanometric particles suspended in water \n\nto which dispersants (e.g. polyacrylates) and binders (e.g. \n\npolyvinyl alcohol) are commonly added. Dispersants, which \n\ncan be anionic, cationic or neutral and which depend on the \n\nliquid carrier and particles suspended in it, reduce particle \n\naggregation and flocculation. Both are undesirable because \n\nthey lead to heterogeneities in the final product and they \n\nchange the slurry\u2019s physical properties such as its \n\nsedimentation behavior and viscosity (Fu et al., 2008; Wegst \n\net al., 2010). \n\nFor a given particle size, the viscosity depends on the \n\ntype of interaction between particles and liquid carrier, \n\nwhether by van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonds or polar \n\ninteractions. For a given type of interaction, the viscosity \n\ndepends on the particle size. In the case of van der Waals \n\nforces, for example, the forces grow with molecular weight \n\nand particle size; the higher the molecular weight or the larger \n\nthe agglomerate, the higher the forces and the higher the \n\nviscosity. For a given particle size, an increase in solid-\n\nvolume fraction has the same effect, because the particles are \n\nmore closely packed, resulting in more and stronger particle\u2013\n\nparticle interactions increasing the strength to flow. The \n\nviscosity of the slurry is a particularly important processing \n\nparameter in freeze-casting. It determines, for a given particle \n\nsize, both the velocity of sedimentation and the critical \n\nfreezing-front velocity at which particle trapping occurs \n\nduring solidification. Viscosity is thus a structural parameter \n\nthat determines the material\u2019s structural and mechanical \n\nproperties (Wegst et al., 2010). \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\n \n\nb) Controlled Solidification of the Slurry \n\n \n\nThis is the critical stage where the structure is formed \n\nand the characteristics of the future porosity are determined. \n\nDuring this stage, continuous crystals of solvent are formed, \n\nunder certain conditions, and grow into the slurry. Ceramic \n\nparticles in suspension in the slurry are rejected by the moving \n\nsolidification front, concentrated and entrapped in-between \n\nthe crystals. To induce this natural segregation phenomenon, \n\nthe slurry is poured in a mold, which undergoes isotropic or \n\nanisotropic cooling to induce homogeneous or directional \n\nsolidification. The solidification conditions are dictated by the \n\ninitial choice of the solvent. Low temperatures (&lt;0 \u00b0C) are \n\nrequired when using water, while room temperature are \n\nsufficient when using camphene, its solidification point being \n\naround 44\u201348 \u00b0C (Deville, 2008). \n\nc) Sublimation of the Solvent  \n\nOnce complete solidification of the sample is \n\nachieved, the sample is kept at conditions of low temperature \n\nand reduced pressure, conditions dictated by the physical \n\nproperties of the solvent. Under these sublimation conditions, \n\nthe solidified solvent is converted into the gas state. Porosity \n\nis created where the solvent crystals were, so that a green \n\nporous structure is obtained; the porosity is a direct replica of \n\nthe solidified solvent structure. When using water, a \n\nconventional freeze-dryer can be used. In the case of \n\ncamphene, the vapor pressure of 1.3 kPa (just below the \n\nmelting temperature) is high enough to allow sublimation at \n\nroom temperature, so that no specific equipment is required \n\n(Deville, 2008). \n\nFigure 6 shows three first steps of freeze-casting \n\nprocess in a graphic with pressure (atm) versus temperature \n\n(\u00b0C), where in point A, there is a ceramic slurry (liquid state), \n\nin point B, the temperature decreases until having  ice crystals \n\nand ceramic particles (solid state), staying in -70 \u00b0C (ultra-\n\nfreezer temperature) and pressure 1 atm, after that, the solid \n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\n \n\nsample were taken to the freeze-dryer to do the lyophilization, \n\npoint C, with -50 \u00b0C and 0.39 atm until the water, before ice \n\ncrystals, go out of the structure (gas state), the final structure \n\nhas the pores and the ceramic particles, point D. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6. Steps of freeze-casting process, A) ceramic slurry \n\n(liquid state); B) ice crystals and ceramic particles (solid \n\nstate); C) Low temperature and pressure until the water, \n\nbefore ice crystals, go out of the structure (gas state); D) final \n\nstructure with pores and the ceramic particles (Source: \n\nAuthor). \n\nd) Sintering or Densification of the Green Body \n\nOnce the solvent has been totally removed, the \n\nobtained green body can be sintered with conventional \n\nsintering technique. The low strength of the green body \n\nprevents any use of pressure assisted sintering (Deville, 2008). \n\nThe porosity of the sintered materials is a replica of \n\nthe original solvent crystals. A variety of pores morphology \n\ncan be obtained, depending on the choice of the solvent, \n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\nslurries formulation and the solidification conditions (Figure \n\n7). Since the solidification is often directional, the porous \n\nchannels run from the bottom to the top of the samples. \n\nHomogeneous freezing (i.e., cooling at constant rate starting \n\nfrom room temperature) results in a more homogeneous ice \n\nnucleation leading to a lamellar porous architecture (Figure \n\n7B), with long-range order, both in the parallel and \n\nperpendicular directions of the ice front. After sintering, the \n\nceramics walls can be completely dense with no residual \n\nporosity, depending on the sintering conditions. In the \n\nparticular case of water being used as a solvent, the \n\nmicrostructure is lamellar, with lamellar channels between the \n\nceramics walls (Araki and Halloran, 2004; Araki and \n\nHalloran, 2005; Deville et al., 2007; Yoon et al, 2007; Deville, \n\n2008). \n\n \n\nFigure 7.

In most of the cases, the mold in \n\nwhich the slurry is initially poured is left with its bottom in \n\npart in contact with a cold surface. The solvent crystals are \n\ntherefore solicited to grow vertically, along the direction of \n\nthe imposed thermal gradient. However, different thermal \n\ngradients can be imposed, to induce a different anisotropy in \n\nthe structure. many factors affecting the porosity and \n\nmechanical properties of the final porous ceramic, such as \n\ninitial solids loading, cooling rate, sintering temperature, and \n\nadditive content (Deville, 2008; Liu and Button, 2013). \n\n3.2.2 Raw materials for porous ceramics \n\n \n\n3.2.2.1 Clay minerals \n\n \n\nBentonite is a plastic and colloidal clay consisting \n\nessentially of montmorillonite and other minerals of the \n\nsmectite group, with other components such as kaolinite, ilite, \n\nfeldspars, amphiboles, cristobalite and quartz. The total non-\n\nclay content of the bentonite is hardly less than 10%. Such \n\ncomponents present varying colors, such as: white, gray, \n\nyellow, brown, green and blue (Grim, 1968). \n\nSmectite is the term given to a group of minerals \n\nconsisting of: montmorillonite, beidelite, nontronite, hectorite \n\nand saponite. Each mineral forms a similar structure, though \n\nchemically different. Nontronite, for example, is an iron-rich \n\nsmectite and hectorite is rich in lithium. The most common \n\nmineral in the economical deposits of the smectite group is \n\nmontmorillonite, which is the predominant mineral in the \n\ncomposition of bentonites. In industry, montmorillonites are \n\ngenerally classified as sodium (Na) or calcium (Ca), \n\ndepending on the predominant exchangeable ion (Hassan and \n\nAbdel-Khalek, 1998; Paiva et al., 2008). \n\n\n\n \n\n52 \n\n \n\n The smectites are hydrated aluminosilicates of \n\naluminum, iron and magnesium, in proportions 2:1 (two \n\ntetrahedron silica-oxygen layers, and the octahedral layer of \n\nmetal-oxygen between them) (Holtzer et al., 2011). \n\n The general chemical formula of montmorillonite is \n\nMx(Al4-xMgx)Si8O20- (OH)4, where M\n+1 is a monovalent \n\ncation. It has particles of sizes that can vary from 0.1 to 2 ?m, \n\nand format of plates or blades (Silva; Ferreira, 2008). Figure 8 \n\nshows the structure of two lamellae of montmorillonite. \n\n \n\nFigure 8. Structure of two lamellae of montmorillonite \n\n(Arshak et al., 2004). \n\nThe term bentonite, according to the literature, was \n\nfirst applied to a type of plastic and colloidal clay from a rock \n\ndiscovered at Fort Benton, Wyoming, USA. Although \n\noriginally the term bentonite referred to the discovered clay \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n\n \n\nrock, at the moment it designates clay constituted, mainly, of \n\nthe clay mineral montmorillonite. This term is also used to \n\ndenote a product with high smectite content (Luz; Lins, 2008). \n\nAs a geological and petrographic term, bentonite is a \n\nrock formed from volcanic ash altered and largely composed \n\nof montmorillonite of the smectite type. It has great ability to \n\nabsorb water and swell (Bulut et al., 2009). \n\nBentonites belong to an important type of clays \n\nwidely used in many sectors of industry, such as drilling of oil \n\nwells and water collection, various foundries, pelletizing of \n\niron ore, chemical and pharmaceutical industries (Amorim et \n\nal., 2006).  \n\nBentonites are mostly calcic or sodic, and sodic \n\nexpand many times their volumes when in contact with water, \n\nforming thixotropic gels. Some cations cause an expansion so \n\nintense that the layers of crystals can be separated up to their \n\nunit cell. Sodium causes the most notable expansion. The \n\ncalcic and sodic varieties, based on exchangeable cation, are \n\nthe most abundant bentonites. If the cation is Na+, the \n\nswelling may progress from 12.5 \u00c5, when the clay is exposed \n\nto air, to a maximum of 40.0 \u00c5, when the clay is fully \n\ndispersed in a liquid medium (Lummus and Azar, 1986).  \n\nThe sodic natural bentonites, such as those found in \n\nArgentina, can withstand temperatures up to 620 \u00b0C. The \n\nactivated bentonites withstand about 450 \u00b0C. (Mariotto, 2005; \n\nAmadio et al., 2017).  \n\n3.2.2.2 Kaolinite \n\n \n\nKaolinite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4) is one of the most abundant \n\nnatural minerals in soils and sediments, normally associate to \n\nclays, and particularly to kaolin. I; it is a dioctahedral 1:1 \n\nphyllosilicate formed by superposition of silicon tetrahedral \n\nsheets and aluminum octahedral sheets. Adjacent layers are \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n\n \n\nlinked by van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds. This \n\ninterlayer induces restricted access to the interlamellar \n\naluminol groups (Al-OH) that may be used for grafting \n\nreactions.  \n\nKaolinite is a clay with a theoretical chemical \n\ncomposition, expressed as a mass percentage of oxides, of \n\n39.50% of Al2O3, 46.54% of SiO2 and 13.96% of H2O, it may \n\nhave variations in its composition (Gu and Evans, 2008; \n\nMagriotis et al., 2010; Cheng, et al., 2012; Caglar, 2012).  \n\nFigure 9 shows a schematic of the kaolinite structure. \n\n \n\nFigure 9. Schematic view of the structure of kaolinite (Cheng \n\net al., 2012). \n\nKaolinite is a material with a wide variety of \n\napplications in the paper industry, where it serves as the filler \n\nmaterial and in the ceramic coating tile industry where it is \n\nused as a pigment for coatings. It is used as an extender in \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\n \n\naqueous based paints and inks, a functional additive in \n\npolymers and is a major component in traditional ceramic \n\nbodies. Its great use is also largely due to the chemical \n\ninertness over a large pH range, easy dispersion, coating \n\ncapacity when used as pigment and reinforcement when used \n\nas a filler. Moreover, it presents high adhesion compatibility, \n\nand low thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity \n\n(Cheng et al., 2012). Table 2 shows some values of physical \n\nand chemical properties of kaolin found in the literature. \n\n \n\nTable 2. Selected physical and chemical properties of kaolin \n\n(Pereira and Silva, 2001; Horpibulsuk et al., 2011). \n\n  \n\nThe most reactive functional groups in kaolinite are \n\nhydroxyl groups, which are capable of taking part in many \n\nchemical reactions as well as ion exchange processes. It is the \n\nmost abundant mineral of the kaolinite group (including \n\ndickite, nacrite, and halloysite). Depending on the application, \n\nkaolinite is often modified from its natural state by physical or \n\nchemical treatment to enhance the properties of the material \n\n(Cheng et al., 2012). \n\n \n\nProperties Values References \n\nMelting point (\u00b0C) \n1650-\n\n1775 \nPereira and Silva, 2001 \n\nTheoretical \n\ndensity (g/cm\u00b3) \n2.65 Horpibulsuk et al., 2011 \n\npH 4.3 a 7 Pereira and Silva, 2001 \n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n\n \n\n3.2.2.3 Alumina \n\n \n\nAlumina is the inorganic product most used in the \n\nindustry to obtain aluminum and ceramic products, it is \n\nobtained through the Bayer process, which is based on the \n\nphysical processing of bauxite, with the presence of additives \n\nsuch as caustic soda at high temperatures and pressures, \n\nfollowed by clarification, precipitation, calcination, grinding \n\nand sizing. The structural formula of alumina is Al2O3 and it \n\nhas only one stable natural crystallographic, the form ?- Al2O3 \n\ncalled corundum (Reed, 1995; Riedel and Chen, 2010). \n\nFigure 10 shows the crystallographic structure of \n\nalumina, with O2- ions forming a compact hexagonal crystal \n\nstructure and Al3+ cations filling the octahedral interstices \n\n(Riedel and Chen, 2010). \n\n \n\nFigure 10. Corundum crystalline structure (Riedel and Chen, \n\n2010). \n\nAlumina ceramics are relatively low cost, and the \n\nceramic components may be manufactured with high output  \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n\n \n\nusing different methods, e.g. by slip casting, pressing, or \n\ninjection molding, without the use of expensive equipment \n\nsuch as kilns with special controlled atmosphere. These \n\nceramics have a high level of mechanical properties; for \n\nexample, some materials can be successfully used in abrasion \n\nand erosion environments; armor systems based on some \n\nkinds of alumina ceramics can defeat high-velocity projectiles \n\nwith steel, lead and even tungsten carbide cores. \n\n(Medvedovski, 2006). Table 3 shows some physical, \n\nmechanical and thermal properties of alumina after sintering. \n\nTable 3.

It is one of the \n\nagricultural \u201cwaste\u201d materials available in plenty in rice \n\nproducing countries, which is amenable for value addition. It \n\nis reported that for every ton of rice produced, ?0.23 tons of \nrice husk is formed. \n\nIf rice husk can be used profitably through value \n\naddition, benefits will contribute to economic and social \n\ndevelopment particularly in developing countries. Value \n\naddition of any material including \u201cwastes\u201d is based on the \n\nclear understanding of its structure and properties.  \n\nRice husk is an abundantly available waste material in \n\nall rice producing countries. In certain regions, it is sometimes \n\nused as a fuel for parboiling paddy in the rice mills. Rice husk \n\nconsists of organic materials (e.g. cellulose, hemicellulose \n\nand lignin) (~75 wt%), amorphous silica (~15 wt%) and \n\nwater (~10 wt%).  (Chandrasekhar et al., 2003; Wu et al., \n\n2009). \n\nOn thermal treatment, SiO2 converts to cristobalite, \n\nwhich is a crystalline form of silica. However, under \n\ncontrolled burning conditions, amorphous silica with high \n\n\n\n \n\n59 \n\n \n\nreactivity, ultra-fine size and large surface area is produced. \n\nThis so-called microsilica can be a raw material for advanced \n\nmaterials like SiC, Si3N4, elemental Si and Mg2Si. Due to the \n\nhigh pozzolanic activity, this rice husk silica also finds \n\napplication in high strength concrete as a substitute for silica \n\nfume. Possibility of using this silica as filler in polymers has \n\nbeen also studied. Rice husk powders can be used as well as \n\nan additive to produce porous structures (Chandrasekhar et al., \n\n2003; Wu et al., 2009). \n\nThe chemical composition of rice husk is found to \n\nvary from sample to sample. The differences in the type of \n\npaddy, crop year, climatic and geographical conditions, in \n\naddition to the sample preparation and method of analysis, \n\ncould be the reason for this variation (Chandrasekhar et al., \n\n2003, Jain et al., 1997). A typical chemical composition of \n\nrice husk (organic components) is shown in Table 4. \n\nTable 4. Typical chemical composition (organic components) \n\nof rice husk (Chandrasekhar et al., 2003). \n\nConstituent \nAmount present in rice \n\nhusk (wt%) \n\n?-cellulose 43.30 \n\nLignin 22.00 \n\nD-xylose 17.52 \n\nl-arabinose 6.53 \n\nMethylglucuronic acid 3.27 \n\nD-galactose 2.37 \n\nTotal 94.99 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n60 \n\n \n\n3.2.2.5 Silver nanoparticles \n\nSilver is a soft, malleable metal, which is stable in \n\nwater and oxygen but attacked by sulfur compounds in air to \n\nform a black sulfide layer (CRC, 1997). The atomic number of \n\nsilver is 47, its atomic weight is 107.868, and it exists in its \n\ncommon valence states of Ag+, Ag2+, and the mineral form of \n\nargentite, Ag2S. Typical ambient concentrations of silver are \n\npresented in Table 5. Silver is present throughout the \n\nenvironment in small concentration (milligram to nanogram), \n\nbut is not essential for animal or plant life (Lantagne, 2001). \n\n \n\nTable 5. Typical Ambient Concentrations of Silver (adapted \n\nfrom CRC, 1997; Lantagne, 2001).\n\n \n\nThe daily dietary intake by humans is estimated at \n\n0.0014 to 0.08 mg. When the maximum CRC intake per day \n\n(0.08 mg) is calculated over a 70-year lifetime, a total of 2.0 \n\ngrams of silver are ingested per person per lifetime (0.08 \n\nmg/day x 365 days/year x 70 years = 2.0 grams/lifetime). \n\nToxic intake for humans is 60 milligrams, while a lethal \n\nintake is 1.3 to 6.2 grams (CRC, 1997; Lantagne, 2001). \n\nNanosized inorganic particles, of either simple or \n\ncomposite nature, display unique properties and represent an \n\nincreasingly important material in the development of novel \n\nnanodevices, which can be used in numerous physical, \n\n\n\n \n\n61 \n\n \n\nbiological, biomedical, and pharmaceutical applications. A \n\nnumber of recent achievements offer the possibility of \n\ngenerating new types of nanostructured materials with \n\ndesigned surface and structural properties (Sondi and Salopek-\n\nSondi, 2004). \n\nNanomaterials are systems that at least one dimension \n\nis 1\u2013100 nm in length with particular physical and chemical \n\nproperties and can be used in numerous applications. \n\nParticularly silver, in the form of nanoparticles has efficient \n\nantimicrobial properties (Singh and Nalwa, 2011; Dash et al., \n\n2012; Leon-Silva et al., 2016; D\u00edaz-Soler et al., 2017). \n\nSuch powders can exhibit properties that differ \n\nsubstantially from those of bulk materials, as a result of small \n\nparticle dimension, high surface area, quantum confinement \n\nand other effects. Most of the unique properties of \n\nnanoparticles require not only the particles to be of nano-\n\nsized, but also the particles be dispersed without \n\nagglomeration. Discoveries in the past decade have clearly \n\ndemonstrated that the electromagnetic, optical and catalytic \n\nproperties of silver nanoparticles are strongly influenced by \n\nshape, size and size distribution, which are often varied by \n\nvarying the synthetic methods, reducing agents and stabilizers \n\n(Abou El-Nour et al., 2010). \n\nSilver is often used as an antibacterial agent, in order \n\nto provide a sanitary environment for the wound healing \n\nprocess. It is considered historically as one of the most \n\nfrequently used antibacterial substances before the invention \n\nof antibiotics. The multiplicity of silver\u2019s bactericidal \n\nmechanisms gives it a wide range of effective applications in \n\nthe inhibition of bacterial growth. The introduction of \n\nnanoparticles has allowed the scientific community to enhance \n\nthe antibacterial properties of silver. The increased surface \n\narea of the nanoparticles in turn induces an increased rate of \n\ninteraction between the test subjects and the ionic silver \n\n\n\n \n\n62 \n\n \n\n(Alexander, 2009; Nam et al., 2015; Bal et al., 2015; Dong et \n\nal., 2016; Mckevica et al., 2016; Amadio et al., 2017). \n\nStrength of bacteria to bactericides and antibiotics has \n\nincreased in recent years due to the development of resistant \n\nstrains. Some antimicrobial agents are extremely irritant and \n\ntoxic and there is much interest in finding ways to formulate \n\nnew types of safe and cost-effective biocidal materials. \n\nPrevious studies have shown that antimicrobial formulations \n\nin the form of nanoparticles could be used as effective \n\nbactericidal materials (Sondi and Salopek-Sondi, 2004). \n\nStoimenov and co-workers demonstrated that highly \n\nreactive metal oxide nanoparticles exhibit excellent biocidal \n\naction against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. \n\nThus, the preparation, characterization, surface modification, \n\nand functionalization of nanosized inorganic particles opens \n\nthe possibility of formulation of a new generation of \n\nbactericidal materials. It is well known that silver ions and \n\nsilver-based compounds are highly toxic to microorganisms \n\nshowing strong biocidal effects on as many as 16 species of \n\nbacteria including E. coli (Stoimenov et al., 2002; Sondi and \n\nSalopek-Sondi, 2004). According to WHO (World Health \n\nOrganization) (WHO, 2014): \n\n? The retention rate of silver in humans and animals is \nunder 10% percent. The retained silver is mainly \n\nstored in the liver and skin. The half-life of silver in \n\nthe liver is 50 days. \n\n? Silver is occasionally found naturally in ground and \nsurface water at 5 ?g/L. \n\n? Average human intake of silver is 7.1 ?g/day. \n\n? The acute lethal dose of silver nitrate is a minimum of \n10 g. \n\n? Argyria is the only known human health effect of \nsilver, and is a condition in which silver is deposed on \n\nskin and hair. \n\n\n\n \n\n63 \n\n \n\nThe U.S. EPA has also investigated silver to \n\ndetermine appropriate drinking water standards and it \n\nrecommends a maximum intake of 5 ?g/kg/day. In the average \n\n70-kilogram adult, this is equivalent to 350 ?g/day. This \n\nrecommendation was established to prevent argyria, a \n\nmedically benign but permanent bluish-gray discoloration of \n\nthe skin. Argyria results from the deposition of silver in the \n\ndermis and also from silver-induced production of melanin. \n\nArgyria is more pronounced in areas exposed to sunlight due \n\nto photoactivated reduction of the metal, and although the \n\ndeposition of silver is permanent, it is not associated with any \n\nadverse health effects. In addition, no evidence of cancer in \n\nhumans has been reported despite frequent therapeutic use of \n\nthe compound over the years. Silver was used for centuries to \n\ntreat syphilis, and as an astringent in topical preparations. \n\n(U.S. EPA, 1999). \n\nArgyria has been described in syphilitic patients in \n\npoor health who were therapeutically dosed with a total of \n\nabout 1 g of silver in the form of silver arsphenamine together \n\nwith other toxic metals. There have been no reports of argyria \n\nor other toxic effects resulting from the exposure of healthy \n\npersons to silver. On the basis of present epidemiological and \n\npharmacokinetic knowledge, a total lifetime oral intake of \n\nabout 10 g of silver can be considered as the human NOAEL \n\n(no observed adverse exposure limit). As the contribution of \n\ndrinking water to this NOAEL will normally be negligible, the \n\nestablishment of a health based guideline value is not deemed \n\nnecessary. On the other hand, special situations may exist \n\nwhere silver salts are used to maintain the bacteriological \n\nquality of drinking water. Higher levels of silver, up to 0.1 \n\nmg/L (a concentration that gives a total dose over 70 years of \n\nhalf the human NOAEL of 10 g), could then be tolerated \n\nwithout risk to health  (WHO, 2014).  \n\nGenerally, specific control of shape, size, and size \n\ndistribution is often achieved by varying the synthesis \n\n\n\n \n\n64 \n\n \n\nmethods, reducing agents and stabilizers (Yeo et al., 2003; He \n\net al., 2004; Abou El-Nour et al., 2010). \n\nMetal nanoparticles can be prepared by two routes, the \n\nfirst one is a physical approach that utilizes several methods \n\nsuch as evaporation/condensation and laser ablation. The \n\nsecond one is a chemical approach in which the metal ions in \n\nsolution is reduced in conditions favoring the subsequent \n\nformation of small metal clusters or aggregates (Khomutov \n\nand Gubin, 2002; Oliveira et al., 2005; Abou El-Nour et al., \n\n2010). \n\nCharacterization of nanoparticles is important to \n\nunderstand and control nanoparticles synthesis and \n\napplications. It is performed using a variety of different \n\ntechniques such as transmission and scanning electron \n\nmicroscopy (TEM, SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), \n\ndynamic light scattering (DLS), X-ray photoelectron \n\nspectroscopy (XPS), powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD), \n\nFourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and UV\u2013Vis \n\nspectroscopy (Khomutov and Gubin, 2002; Yeo et al., 2003; \n\nHe et al., 2004; Abou El-Nour et al., 2010). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n65 \n\n \n\n4 Motivation, novelty and structure of the thesis \n\n4.1 Motivation and novelty \n\n \n\nTable 6 shows selected works performed in the last 20 \n\nyears on fabrication and characterization of porous ceramic \n\nfilters for water purification, with some respective \n\nperformance parameters.  \n\nIn the majority of the works mentioned, pressing was \n\nused as shaping technique. Freeze casting is generally used for \n\nother applications. The closest approach regarding our focus \n\nin this work, with the similar parameters, was that of Li and Li \n\n(2012). Nevertheless, they used TBA (tert-butyl alcohol) as a \n\nsolvent instead of water, which increases the cost and toxicity \n\nof the process. This work presents as novelty the idea of \n\nfabricating water filter by freeze-casting using alumina and \n\nkaolinite aqueous slurries. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n66 \n\n \n\nTable 6.

Bentonites functionalized by impregnation with TiO2, Ag, \n\nPd and Au nanoparticles \n\nThis part of the work was carried out at ISTEC/CNR, \n\nItaly. It aimed to characterize bentonites with different \n\nfeatures and origins (Brazil, Argentina, Italy and United \n\nStates) that were impregnated with Ag, TiO2, Pd and Au \n\nnanoparticles. Either commercial (TiO2) or synthesized (Ag, \n\nPd and Au) nanoparticles (NP) were used and characterized \n\nby DLS and XRD. Subsequently, the dispersed NP were \n\nimpregnated on bentonite by two alternative methods, \n\nimbibition or dipping. The efficiency of impregnation of \n\nbentonite by metallic nanoparticles was finally tested by ICP-\n\nOES.  \n\n? Fabrication of pressed porous ceramic filters for water \n\npurification with kaolinite and/or alumina  \n\nIn this chapter, the work aimed to obtain porous ceramic \n\nfilter with kaolinite and/or alumina, by pressing, using rice \n\nhusk as a sacrificial agent, for water filtration. Rice husk was \n\ncharacterized by TG, DSC and SEM. Many compositions \n\nwere tested with kaolinite and/or alumina, with or without rice \n\nhusk, and with and without water. The mechanical strength \n\nwas measured by compression tests, and pre-tests of \n\npermeability of the final pellets were performed.  \n\n? Influence of alumina particle size on the performance of \n\nfreeze-cast filters \n\nThis chapter aimed to verify the influence of the particle \n\nsize on freeze cast filters. Two alumina powders (coarse and \n\nfine) of the same kind and from the same manufacturer were \n\n\n\n \n\n68 \n\n \n\nused, corresponding to particle sizes of 2.5 and 0.5 \u00b5m \n\nrespectively. It was intended to analyze what is the more \n\nsuitable for freeze-casting for the application of ceramic filter \n\nfor drinking water (pellets). The powders of alumina were \n\ncharacterized by average particle size and distribution, zeta \n\npotential, XRF, density by picnometry, specific surface area \n\n(BET), and SEM. Parameters like rheology, solidification \n\nrates, compression resistance, porosity and permeability were \n\nanalyzed.  \n\n? Fabrication of freeze-cast porous alumina/kaolinite \n\nfilters for water purification \n\nThis chapter aimed to obtain ceramic filter pellets with \n\nalumina and kaolinite, by freeze-casting method, for water \n\nfiltration applications. The powders were characterized by \n\nanalyses of average particle size, zeta potential, TG, DSC, \n\nXRD, XRF, density by picnometry, and specific surface area \n\n(BJH). The mechanical strength was measured under \n\ncompression, and permeability evaluation was based on \n\nForchheimer\u2019s equation; final pellets were analyzed by SEM, \n\nand their filtration efficiency was assessed using Colilert and \n\nQuanti-Tray/2000.  \n\n? Freeze-cast porous ceramic filters impregnated with \n\nsilver nanoparticles \n\nIn this chapter pellets of porous ceramic filters of \n\nalumina and kaolinite were impregnated with silver \n\nnanoparticles to test the bactericidal efficiency. Silver \n\nnanoparticles were characterized by average particle size, zeta \n\npotential, SEM/EDS and TEM. The AgNPs were impregnated \n\nby dipping (method developed in the first part of this work). \n\nAfter impregnation, leached water was analyzed by graphite \n\nfurnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS) to measure \n\nefficiency in silver impregnation.  \n\n  \n\nhttps://www.idexx.com/water/products/quanti-tray.html\n\n\n \n\n69 \n\n \n\n5 Bentonites functionalized by impregnation with \nTiO2, Ag, Pd and Au nanoparticles1 \n\n5.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nBentonite is a clay composed by montmorillonite \n\nand/or other terms of the smectite group, and minor non-clay \n\nminerals. Montmorillonites are swellable dioctahedral 2:1 \n\nlayersilicates, which consist of stacks of several so-called 2:1 \n\nlayers. This clay mineral has a permanent negative charge that \n\narises from isomorphous substitution of Al3+ for Si4+ at the \n\ntetrahedral sheet and Mg2+ for Al3+ at the octahedral sheet. \n\nThis negative charge is naturally compensated by \n\nexchangeable cations (i.e. Na+, Ca2+) located in the interlayer \n\nspace (Bergaya et al., 2006). Montmorillonite has a high \n\ncation exchange capacity (CEC), marked swelling and high \n\nspecific surface area leading to a strong adsorption/desorption \n\ncapacity of ionic or polar compounds (Ikhtiyarova et al., 2012; \n\nParolo et al., 2014). \n\nWhen individual lamellae of montmorillonite are \n\nexposed to water, the water molecules are adsorbed on silica \n\nsheets, which are then separated from each other. This \n\ninterlayer swelling is controlled by the cation associated with \n\nthe clay structure. The thickness of the water interlayer varies \n\nwith the nature of the cation adsorbed and the amount of water \n\navailable (Brindley, 1955; Bergaya et al., 2006).   \n\nSodic bentonites expand many times their volumes \n\nwhen in contact with water. If the cation is Na+, the swelling \n\nmay progress from 12.5 \u00c5, when the clay is exposed to air, to \n\na maximum of 40.0 \u00c5, when the clay is fully dispersed in a \n\nliquid medium (Lummus and Azar, 1986). The sodic natural \n\n                                                           \n1 Published in Applied Clay Science, Volume 146, 15 September \n2017, Pages 1-6. \nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169131717302\n34X \n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016913171730234X\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016913171730234X\n\n\n \n\n70 \n\n \n\nbentonites, such as those found in Argentina, can withstand \n\ntemperatures up to 620 \u00b0C. The activated bentonites withstand \n\nabout 450 \u00b0C. \n\nThe features of a bentonite directly depend on its \n\ncomposition, impurities and origin (Paiva et al., 2008; Holtzer \n\net al., 2011). The bentonites that do not have the desired \n\nproperties for an application can be modified in some ways to \n\nreach the requirements and market demands, for example, by \n\nimpregnation of nanoparticles. According to current \n\ndefinitions, nanomaterials are considered natural, fabricated or \n\nincidentally formed materials having 50% or more particles \n\nwith one or more external dimensions in the range of 1-100 \n\nnm (European Commission, 2011). Their outstanding \n\nproperties have been described in many books, comprehensive \n\nreviews and research papers (e.g., Rao et al., 2007). \n\nClay minerals may be regarded as natural \n\nnanostructured materials, since their crystallites are usually \n\ncharacterized by one dimension in the nanorange. Clay \n\nminerals present external surfaces including edges and \n\ninternal surfaces of interlayer spaces. A clay particle is an \n\nassembly of layered crystallites and a clay aggregate is an \n\nassembly of clay particles. Therefore, we may distinguish \n\nbetween interlayer, interparticle, and interaggregate pores of \n\ndifferent sizes and shapes (Bergaya et al., 2006; Praus et al., \n\n2013; Abreu et al., 2015). \n\nBentonites with more than 70% montmorillonite have \n\nattracted considerable interest because they are easily \n\navailable in bulk quantities, economically attractive and \n\nenvironmentally friendly. They have excellent swelling and \n\nadsorption properties, being used as a support to disperse and \n\nstabilize nanoparticles in various applications (Ayari et al., \n\n2005; Hashemian, 2010; Zamparas et al., 2012; Motshekga et \n\nal., 2015). \n\nNanoparticles of metals and metal oxides, such as Ag, \n\nAu, Pd and TiO2 have physical and chemical properties that \n\n\n\n \n\n71 \n\n \n\ndepend on their size and shape. The size reduction to \n\nnanometric dimensions causes the material to acquire a \n\nbehavior between \u201cbulk\u201d and molecular. One of the features \n\nrelated to the decrease in particle size is the increasing of \n\nsurface area, which greatly enhances their applications that \n\ndepends on surface sites.  \n\nThe objective of this part of the work is to develop a \n\nnovel route, which may be transferred to the industry, aiming \n\nthe functionalization of bentonites through the impregnation \n\nof nanoparticles. This implies a dual target: primarily, to \n\nenable bentonites to acquire properties that are not preexistent \n\n(improving their performance in current uses and disclosing \n\nnew applications) and, additionally, to exploit the use of \n\nbentonite as encapsulating matrices for the handling and \n\ntransportation of nanoparticles. In the latter case, new  \n\npromising prospective uses are open for the development of \n\ncost-effective, molecular designed solutions that decrease the \n\npotential risk associated to NP exposure (Ortelli and Costa, \n\n2016; Costa et al., 2016) thanks to the encapsulating effects of \n\nenvironmental friendly bentonite. In line with the performance \n\nrequirements of a sustainable and safer design approach, the \n\nmesoporosity of bentonite hosting structure should also \n\nguarantee the preservation of NP reactivity. \n\n5.2 Materials and methods \n\n5.2.1 Raw materials and synthesis methods \n\nBentonites from Brazil (QB; T-Cota), Argentina (BL; \n\nT-Cota), Italy (P1 and P4; Laviosa) and United States (WY; \n\nLaviosa) were characterized by surface area (BET, \n\nQuantachrome, NOVA 2200e, USA) swelling (Foster \n\nmethod), chemical composition (XRF, Epsilon 3, \n\nPANalytical), particle size distribution by sedimentation \n\n(SediGraph 5100, Micromeritics), CEC (cation exchange \n\ncapacity) by the methylene blue method. Thermal analyses \n\n(TG and DSC) were performed simultaneously (Netzsch, \n\n\n\n \n\n72 \n\n \n\nSTA449 Jupiter, Germany) within the 25-1000 \u00b0C range under \n\nair atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C min?1. \n\nTiO2 nanosols (nanoparticle dispersions) were \n\ncommercially available (Cericol, Colorobbia), with a solid \n\nloading of 1 wt%); Ag, Au and Pd nanoparticles were \n\nsynthesized in the laboratory. The following analytic grade \n\nreagents (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) were used: AgNO3, HAuCl4, \n\nNaOH, and PdCl2, as well as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw \n\n29000, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and D(+) glucose (Merck, \n\nGermany). Metallic nanoparticles were prepared by using a \n\nmicrowave assisted eco-friendly method (Blosi et al., 2014). \n\nAg colloids were obtained through the reduction of AgNO3 in \n\nthe presence of PVP. First, 3.13 g of PVP were dissolved in 90 \n\nml of distilled water, then 0.28 g of NaOH and 0.90 g of D(+) \n\nglucose were added to the solution. When all the reagents \n\nwere dissolved, the solution was heated at 70 \u00baC, 10 ml of an \n\naqueous AgNO3 solution (0.5 M) was injected, and the \n\nreaction was allowed to proceed for 3 min. By adding AgNO3, \n\nthe solution immediately turned brown with intense yellow \n\nshades. Highly stable suspensions with a solid loading of 0.5 \n\nwt% were initially achieved and, by using optimized \n\nconditions, the solid loading was further increased to 4 wt% \n\n(Blosi et al., 2010; Blosi et al., 2014). \n\nAu nanoparticles were synthesized by mixing PVP \n\n(0.35 g) and glucose (from 0.20 to 0.40 g) in a round bottom \n\nflask containing water (80 ml). The solution was microwave-\n\nheated at ambient pressure to a temperature ranging from 70 \n\nto 90 \u00b0C (heating rate of 30 \u00b0C/min). At this temperature, \n\naqueous NaOH (0.88 M) and HAuCl4 (10 ml, 0.11 M) \n\nsolutions were added to the flask and stirred for 2.5 min. After \n\nthe reaction, a red, stable suspension of gold nanoparticles \n\nwith a solid loading of 0.2 wt% was obtained (Blosi et al., \n\n2010; Blosi et al., 2014). \n\nPd nanoparticles were synthesized through reduction \n\nof PdCl2. The experiments were performed following the same \n\n\n\n \n\n73 \n\n \n\nprocedure used for gold colloids. In the Pd case, only the \n\nNaOH/metal molar ratio was adjusted during the synthesis \n\noptimization procedure (Blosi et al., 2010; Blosi et al., 2014). \n\n5.2.2 Processing and characterization \n\nThe nanoparticles used in this study (Ag, TiO2, Au \n\nand Pd) were characterized by XRD (Bruker, D8 Advance \n\nwith LynxEye detector, Germany) with a 2? range from 0 to \n\n80\u00b0, 0.02 step size, 16 s (equivalent) time-per-step, and DLS \n\n(Malvern, MPT-2, UK), working at a fixed angle of 173\u00b0. \n\nXRD was performed on the nanoparticles in an aqueous \n\nsuspension to overcome problems due to the high \n\nhygroscopicity of the dried particles. Some drops of the \n\nsuspension were deposited on a borosilicate sample holder and \n\nsubmitted to XRD analysis. Although this procedure is not \n\nconventional, it has been mentioned in the literature (Cruciani \n\net al., 2011; Taglieri et al., 2013).  \n\nQB and BL bentonites were impregnated with Ag, \n\nTiO2, Au and Pd nanosols. In the direct method or imbibition, \n\nthe nanoparticles suspensions were dropped on a certain \n\namount of powder. The imbibition was performed with spatula \n\nand mortar until the initial coloration of bentonite was not \n\nmore observed. The procedure was repeated varying the \n\nnanoparticle percentage in relation to the bentonite mass: 1 \n\nand 2 wt% Ag, 1 to 3 wt% TiO2 and 0.1 wt% Au and Pd. \n\nThe impregnation efficiency was characterized in \n\nsamples of bentonites impregnated with nanoparticles (2 wt% \n\nAg, 3 wt% TiO2 and 0.1 wt% Au and Pd), after washing with \n\nwater. The clay was dispersed in distilled water (10 wt% \n\nclay/water), the slurry underwent a magnetic stirring and was \n\nthen centrifuged with 5000 rpm during 10 min. The \n\nsupernatant (15 mL) was transferred to a plastic test tube \n\ncoupled to a filter of 10 kDa to detect remaining \n\nnanoparticles. This tube was centrifuged again in the same \n\nconditions described before. The resulting solution above the \n\nfilter possibly containing the nanoparticles was then collected \n\n\n\n \n\n74 \n\n \n\nand analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical \n\nEmission Spectrometry (ICP-OES, Varian, Liberty 200, \n\nAustralia) and by X-ray Powder  Diffraction (XRD, Bruker, \n\nD8 Advance, Germany). \n\nAnother impregnation method used was dipping. \n\nAqueous slurries of 10 wt% Ag, TiO2, Pd or Au nanoparticles \n\nwere prepared. Samples of bentonites BL and QB were chosen \n\nto continue the tests. The samples were stored in a grid/filter \n\nwith holes of 149 \u00b5m, and dipped into the respective slurries. \n\nThen, the bags were removed from the slurries and samples \n\nwere taken for drying in oven at 100 \u00b0C during 1 h.  \n\nA heat treatment was performed for the bentonites QB \n\nand BL to identify the influence of temperature on the \n\nnanoparticles impregnation process. The bentonites were \n\ntreated at temperatures from 100 to 700 \u00b0C. Table 1 shows the \n\nbentonites QB and BL and their method of impregnation with \n\ntheir Ag NP solution used and their treatments in their \n\nrespective order of process.  \n\nSEM-FEG was employed to characterize Ag \n\nnanoparticles distribution within the bentonite BL matrix. In \n\nthis case, samples were prepared according to either one of the \n\nfollowing sequences: \n\n? imbibition, thermal treatment at 100 \u00b0C \u2013 BL 1 \n\n? imbibition, thermal treatment at 700 \u00b0C \u2013 BL 3 \n\n? thermal treatment at 700 \u00b0C, imbibition \u2013 BL 7 \n\n? thermal treatment at 700 \u00b0C, dipping \u2013 BL 8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n75 \n\n \n\nTable 5. 1.

Only for bentonite \n\n\n\n \n\n76 \n\n \n\nQB, it was possible to measure the particle size by \n\nsedimentation. The other bentonites showed the formation of a \n\ndense and viscous layer, both in water and in alcohol, \n\ncorresponding to flocculation and phase separation. \n\nComparing the chemical composition of bentonites to \n\nthe cation exchange capacity (CEC) and swelling, it can be \n\nseen that the sodic bentonites are those which have the highest \n\nCEC and swelling values. Therefore, they attract the greatest \n\nattention from the industry. \n\nTable 5. 2.

There is a significant initial \n\nloss of mass, around 100 \u00b0C, related to water adsorbed on the \n\n\n\n \n\n77 \n\n \n\nexternal surface of the material and located in the interlayers \n\nof the crystalline structure. The mass lost between 500 and \n\n650 \u00b0C corresponds to dehydroxylation. From 700 \u00b0C on, the \n\ncurves present practically no longer any significant loss of \n\nmass. WY and P1 bentonites had the lowest and the highest \n\nmass losses, respectively. These transformations are shown in \n\nDSC curves (Figure 1B). In addition, it is possible to observe \n\na significant exothermic peak between 800 and 900 \u00b0C, \n\ncharacteristic of crystallization of a new phase. At 910 \u00b0C, an \n\nevent represents the decomposition of dolomite impurity. \n\nAbove 900 \u00b0C major structural changes resulting in the \n\ndevelopment of cristobalite and mullite in montmorillonite \n\ncan occur (Galindo et al., 2013; Caglar et al., 2009; Bergaya et \n\nal., 2006; Occelli and Tindwa, 1983; Neaman et al., 2003). \n\n \n\nFigure 5. 1.

Nano-TiO2 \n\n(Figure 2A) presents a bimodal distribution possibly due to \n\nagglomeration, with peaks respectively at ~6 and ~70 nm. For \n\n3 different measurements, the distribution is constant. Figure \n\n2B shows minor peaks in the micrometric range (5 ?m) that \n\noccur due to agglomeration of nano-Au. The highest peak \n\noccurs between 100 and 200 nm, with primary nanoparticles \n\nin the range of 20 to 30 nm. Figure 2C shows that Pd \n\nnanoparticles have a variation of peaks for each analysis, \n\nwhich demonstrates a possible instability of the suspension. \n\nThe occurrence of several peaks may occur due to an \n\nagglomeration of nano-Pd. A major peak is located at about \n\n200 nm, with the smallest fraction at 10 to 30 nm. Figure 2D \n\nshows the distribution of Ag nanoparticles with constant, well-\n\ndefined peaks. In this case, no detectable agglomeration \n\noccurred. A single peak can be observed at approximately 90 \n\nnm.  \n\n \n\nFigure 5. 2.

The broad band at \n\n~28\u00b0 in Figures 3A, 3B and 3C, typical of borosilicate glass, \n\ncan be observed because of the low concentration of \n\nnanoparticles and to the glassy nature of the sample holder. In \n\nFigure 3D, the hump at 28\u00b0 is hardly visible due to the much \n\nhigher concentration of TiO2 (15.5 wt%), which presents a \n\nhigher degree of crystallinity as well. Figure 3A shows the \n\ndiffractogram of nano-Ag (1 wt% in water) with indication of \n\nthe peaks of silver. A similar feature occurs for nano-Au \n\n(Figure 3B) even if its concentration in the aqueous \n\nsuspension is as low as 0.011 wt%. Figure 3C shows the \n\ndiffractogram of nano-Pd, which does not present well-\n\ndefined peaks. This can be attributed to the low concentration \n\n(0.011 wt% in water) and small size (under 20 nm) of primary \n\nPd nanoparticles in the suspension. Figure 3D shows the \n\ndiffractogram of nano-TiO2 (15.5 wt% in water).

In the case of \n\nAg, above 99% of nanoparticles were retained by the \n\nbentonite after washing with water. TiO2 could not be \n\nmeasured by ICP-OES due to low accuracy of the detection \n\nmethod for this sample. According to Motshekga et al. (2015), \n\nthe nanoparticles in the bentonites were proven to be stable, \n\nwith leaching values under the accepted WHO standards (0.1 \n\nmg/l) (WHO, 2011).  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n81 \n\n \n\nTable 5. 3.

The impregnation \n\nefficiency after washing with water is over 99% in the case of \n\nnano-Ag, and over 90% for Au, Pd and TiO2 nanoparticles. \n\nSuch a different behavior could be related to the colloidal \n\nstability of nanosuspensions used during impregnation. \n\nNano-Ag was characterized by a higher stability and \n\nparticle dispersion in suspension, while Au, Pd and TiO2 \n\nnanoparticles suffered from some agglomeration and their \n\nsuspensions exhibited an unstable behavior. \n\n\n\n \n\n83 \n\n \n\n6 Fabrication of pressed porous ceramic filters for \nwater purification with kaolinite and/or alumina2 \n\n \n\n6.1 Introduction \n\n \n\n The access to clean and safe water is of paramount \n\nimportance for human health. It is estimated that in the 21st \n\ncentury more than one billion people do not have access to \n\nsafe drinking water. Much of this population is concentrated \n\nin underdeveloped countries, especially in rural areas. Small \n\ncommunities have the most difficulty in receiving water in \n\nsufficient quantity and quality, population is exposed to \n\ndiseases transmitted through the water (Mwabi et al., 2011). \n\n Porous ceramic filters are among the most effective \n\ntreatments for water purification. Ceramic filters have been \n\nwidely used for microbiological treatment of water due to its \n\nlow cost. Porous ceramics may be manufactured from oxides \n\nsuch as alumina, titania, or zirconia. The advantages of porous \n\nceramics over other filtration techniques and materials are \n\ntheir chemical, thermal and pH stability. Allied to the previous \n\nfeatures, there is also the longevity and strength to pressure, \n\ntemperature and corrosion, bringing an excellent cost/benefit \n\nrelationship (Lv et al, 2009; Bielefeldt et al, 2009; Simonis \n\nand Basson, 2011). \n\nSeveral processing routes such as replica, sacrificial \n\ntemplate, or direct foaming methods are available for the \n\nproduction of macroporous ceramics. The techniques differ \n\ngreatly in terms of processing features and final \n\nmicrostructures/properties achieved (Studart et al., 2006).  \n\nThe sacrificial template technique usually consists of \n\nthe preparation of a biphasic composite comprising a \n\ncontinuous matrix of ceramic particles or ceramic precursors \n\n                                                           \n2 Submitted. \n\n\n\n \n\n84 \n\n \n\nand a dispersed sacrificial phase that is homogeneously \n\ndistributed throughout the matrix and ultimately extracted to \n\ngenerate pores within the microstructure. This method leads to \n\nporous materials displaying a negative replica of the original \n\nsacrificial template, as opposed to the positive morphology \n\nobtained from the replica technique (Studart et al., 2006). \n\nThe extraction of the sacrificial material from the \n\nconsolidated composite depends primarily on the type of pore \n\nformer employed. Predominantly open pores of various \n\ndifferent morphologies can be produced with this method. The \n\nmechanical strength of cellular structures produced is often \n\nsubstantially higher than that achieved with the positive \n\nreplica techniques (Aranberri et al., 2009; Studart et al., 2006). \n\nRice husk is an abundantly available waste material \n\nin all rice producing countries. It consists of organic \n\nmaterials (e.g. cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) \n\n(~75 wt%), amorphous silica (~15 wt%) and water \n\n(~10 wt%). In certain regions, rice husk is sometimes used as \n\na fuel for parboiling paddy in the rice mills. The partially \n\nburnt rice husk in turn contributes to more environmental \n\npollution. There have been efforts not only to overcome this \n\nbut also to find value addition to these wastes using them as \n\nsecondary source of materials. In respect of environmental \n\nfriendly and cost-effectiveness, the rice husk powders have \n\nbeen used as an additive to produce porous structure \n\n(Chandrasekhar et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2009). \n\nIn this work, water filters were obtained by a simple \n\nuniaxial pressing from alumina and/or kaolinite powders with \n\nand without rice husks, as pore forming agents. \n\n6.2 Materials and methods \n\n6.2.1 Raw materials and processing \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n85 \n\n \n\nThe powders used as raw materials for the porous \n\nfilters were kaolinite, (Colorminas) and alumina (CT 3000, \n\nAlmatis). Rice husk was provided by Arroz Fumacense \n\n(Morro da Fuma\u00e7a, SC, Brazil) was used as a porogenic agent \n\nand characterized by moisture content, TG/DSC (STA 449 F3, \n\nJupiter) and SEM (TM3030, Hitachi). \n\nFor the moisture tests, the samples were prepared \n\naccording to NBR 6923 (1981), and set in a furnace at 105 \u00b0C \n\nduring 6 h, with measures after 3, 4, 5 and 6 h. Moreover, \n\nNBR 8112 (1986) and ASTM E871 (2014) were applied \n\n(ABNT 1981; ABNT 1986; ASTM, 2014). \n\nRice husks were milled in a jar mill (CB2-T, BP), \n\nduring 20 min. Fractions of rice husks of different sizes were \n\ntaken. After every milling around 15 g powder (<70 mesh, \n\n210 \u00b5m), 12 g (between 35 and 70 mesh), and 11 g (>35 \n\nmesh, 420 \u00b5m) was obtained. \n\nThe samples were pressed at 10, 20, 30, or 50 MPa, \n\nduring 1 to 5 min to produce pellets with 20.0 \u00b1 0.5 mm \n\ndiameter and 6.5 \u00b1 1 mm length. A heat treatment was done to \n\nremove the porogenic agent (rice husks) and the organic \n\ndispersant (Darvan CN, Vanderbilt), at 1 \u00baC/min up to 500 \u00baC \n\nwith a soaking time of 1 h at 500 \u00baC, in a resistive furnace (J-\n\n200, Jung). Then, samples with only kaolinite were sintered at \n\n900, 1000 and 1100 \u00baC, and samples of alumina, with or \n\nwithout kaolinite, were sintered at 1500, 1550 and 1600 \u00baC, \n\nwith a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C/min, and dwell time of 1 and 2 h, \n\nrespectively, for kaolinite and alumina, at the maximum \n\ntemperature, in another resistive furnace (EDG-1600). \n\n6.2.2 Formulation and characterization  \n\nDifferent compositions were tested, as shown in Table \n\n1. \n\n\n\n \n\n86 \n\n \n\nTable 6. 1.

For the \n\nporosity desired, a pressure as low as possible is better, but the \n\nsamples needed a minimal mechanical strength to keep the \n\nshape. Considering it, the best results were obtained applying \n\n10 MPa, during 3 min. \n\nSamples of alumina with or without kaolinite, were \n\nmoved to another furnace and sintered at 1550 \u00baC (minimum \n\ntemperature with complete sintering of alumina), with a \n\nheating rate of 5 \u00b0C/min, and dwell time of 2 h at the \n\nmaximum temperature. \n\nFor the determination of apparent density, water \n\nabsorption) and apparent porosity of the final filter, ASTM \n\nC20-00 (2015) was applied. The compression strength was \n\nmeasured by a universal mechanical testing machine (DL \n\n20000, Emic), with a load cell of 20 N and a loading velocity \n\nof 0.5 mm/min, according to ASTM C133 (1997). Pre-tests of \n\npermeability of the final pellets were carried in a lab build \n\napparatus, using a glass funnel on the top of a graded burette. \n\nEach pellet was placed in the glass funnel and sealed with \n\nsilicone to prevent the water leaking. The flow rate was \n\nmeasured by the amount of water passing through the filter in \n\nml/h. \n\n6.3 Results and discussion \n\nThe moisture of rice husk samples was determined \n\nafter 3, 4, 5 and 6 h at 105\u00baC (Figure 1A). The main loss of \n\nwater occurred in the first 3 h, around 10 wt%. From 3 to 6 h, \n\nthere was no significant weight loss. Figure 1B shows the \n\ncorresponding total solids loss.   \n\n\n\n \n\n88 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6. 1. Drying of rice husk: (a) residual moisture, (b) \n\ntotal solids loss.  \n\nFigure 2 shows the results of thermogravimetric \n\nanalysis confirming an initial mass loss of 10% around 100 \n\n\u00baC, corresponding to the sample moisture, and a sharp loss of \n\nmass between 250 and 400 \u00baC, where rice husk decomposition \n\noccurs. \n\n \n\nFigure 6. 2. Thermogravimetric analysis of rice husk: (a) \n\nTGA, (b) DTG. \n\nFigure 2B shows the derivative of the mass loss \n\ncurve, where a small peak of the water loss of the sample is \n\nobserved at ~100\u00baC and then a very sharp peak showing the \n\ncritical temperature where the rice husk decomposition takes \n\nplace can be seen at ~370 \u00b0C. Next to this peak, a shoulder \n\nstarting at 300 \u00b0C may correspond to the constitutional water \n\nloss of the sample.  \n\n\n\n \n\n89 \n\n \n\nA DSC analysis of the rice husk, Figure 3, shows a \n\nsmall endothermic peak due the water loss, and a gradual \n\nexothermic feature due to the combustion of the rice husk. \n\n \n\nFigure 6. 3.

Samples with only alumina have a higher \n\ndensification, in consequence, lower porosity; the higher \n\nporosities occurred in samples with lower percentage of solids \n\n(35 to 60 wt%). Alumina and kaolinite mixtures with total \n\n\n\n \n\n92 \n\n \n\nsolids of 50 and 60 wt% had similar porosity and higher \n\nvalues than samples with only alumina or kaolinite. \n\nThe mechanical tests showed that all the samples had \n\nan average compression strength of 90 \u00b1 5 MPa, \n\ncorresponding to high densification and low permeability to \n\nbe used as a filter. During the tests of water flow rate, with \n\nsamples with only alumina or kaolinite, some defects could be \n\nobserved in the pellets, as shown in Figure 5.  \n\n \n\nFigure 6. 5. Different defects that appeared in the pellets \n\nduring the tests of permeability (flow rate). A) Walls falling \n\napart; B) Flow through the funnel; C) Division into layers; D) \n\nCenter went down ; E) Cracks. \n\n All samples with both kaolinite and alumina (KA1, \n\nKA2, KA3, KA4, KA5, KA6, KA7, KA8, KA9 and KA10) \n\npresented a suitable strength after contact with water. The \n\npellets remained constant, but the water flow rate did not \n\nreach values high enough for water filtering, with less than \n\n0.01 l/h. According to Lantagne (2001), Bielefeldt et al. \n\n\n\n \n\n93 \n\n \n\n(2009) and Salvinelli et al. (2016), a flow rate recommend to \n\nwater filters is 1-3 l/h.  \n\n6.4 Conclusions \n\n \n\nFilter samples made only with kaolinite presented low \n\nporosity and their densification was incomplete after sintering \n\nat 1100 \u00baC. They did not reached enough mechanical strength \n\nfor their handling without degradation.  \n\nAlumina samples were denser, i. e., less porous, \n\nwhich were not suitable for water filtration purposes. All the \n\nsamples with kaolinite and alumina presented a good strength \n\nafter contact with water, but the flow rate of less than 0.01 l/h \n\nis not indicated for water filtering. \n\nThus, uniaxial pressed water filters of kaolinite and/or \n\nalumina with or without rice husks are not suitable for the \n\nintended application, at least in the conditions tested here.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n94 \n\n \n\n7 Influence of alumina particle size on the \nperformance of freeze-cast filters3 \n\n \n\n7.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nFreeze casting has received broad attention as a \n\nsimple and versatile fabrication technique of porous \n\nstructures, which generally offers a wider range of pore \n\ncharacteristics. It involves the preparation of a ceramic slip \n\nthat is poured into a mold, which is then frozen and subjected \n\nto sublimation drying of the solvent under vacuum (Sofie and \n\nDogan, 2001; Deville et al., 2007; Fukushima et al., 2008; \n\nYoon et al., 2008; Li and Li, 2012). \n\nGiven the inherent strength of frozen solvents, this \n\nmethod allows the frozen solvent to temporarily act as a \n\nbinder to hold the part together for demolding. Removal of the \n\nsolvent by sublimation also eliminates drying stresses and \n\nshrinkage that may lead to cracks and warping during the \n\nnormal drying of a solvent-saturated body (Sofie and Dogan, \n\n2001). \n\nMany factors influence the microstructure and \n\nproperties of porous ceramics fabricated by freeze casting, \n\nsuch as composition and initial solids loading, cooling rate, \n\nsintering temperature, and additive content (Deville, 2008; Hu \n\net al., 2010; Liu and Button, 2013). \n\nNevertheless, the effect of particle size of the ceramic \n\npowder constituent in freeze casting has attracted little \n\nattention. The particle size has a major effect on the final \n\nmechanical properties, since it is expected that smaller \n\nparticles improve the densification and lead to lower porosity \n\n(Araki and Halloran, 2005; Koh et al., 2006; Yoon et al, 2007; \n\nLiu and Button, 2013). \n\n                                                           \n3 Submitted.  \n\n\n\n \n\n95 \n\n \n\nFukasawa et al. applied freeze casting to fabricate \n\nporous alumina ceramics with unidirectionally aligned pore \n\nchannels, which is a desirable feature for water filters \n\n(Fukasawa et al., 2001; Fukasawa et al., 2002; Deville, 2008). \n\nWe employed two alumina with different particle \n\nsizes to investigate the influence of the particle size on freeze \n\ncasting processing and products as a filters for potable water. \n\n7.2 Materials and methods \n\n7.2.1 Raw materials and characterization \n\n \n\nThe powders used as raw materials for the filter were \n\nalumina (CT 3000, Almatis), with mean particle size of 0.5 \n\nand 2.5 \u00b5m, named respectively as F for fine, and C for coarse \n\npowder. They were characterized by measuring particle size \n\ndistribution and zeta potential (Zetasizer, Nanosizer, Malvern; \n\nStabino, Nanoflex, Particle Metrix), dispersion stability \n\n(Lumisizer, L.U.M.); as well as by TG/DSC (STA 449 F3 \n\nJupiter, Netzsch); XRD (Desktop MiniFlex II, Rigaku); XRF \n\n(WDXRF Axios Max, Panalytical); picnometric density ( \n\nUltrapicnometer 1200 P/N, Quantachrome); specific surface \n\narea (BJH, Nova 1200e, Quantachrome); and SEM (TM3030, \n\nHitachi). \n\n7.2.2 Formulation, processing and characterization of \nfilters \n\nThe forming of the samples was by freeze casting, \n\nwhere the velocity and the angle that the slurry was cast was \n\nmaintained as constant as possible. The pores were controlled \n\nby changing the concentration of solids in the slurry. The \n\ncompositions of the slurries are shown in Table 1, where C \n\nstands for coarse alumina (2.5 \u00b5m) and F for fine alumina (0.5 \n\n\u00b5m). All the samples have 1.5% organic dispersant (Darvan, \n\nC-N, Vanderbilt) and the balance is distilled water. \n\n\n\n \n\n96 \n\n \n\nAfter freeze-casting, samples were kept in an ultra-\n\nfreezer at -70 \u00b0C, during 24 h, and then transferred to a freeze-\n\ndryer (Liotop L102, Liobras) with pressure &lt;0.39 atm (300 \n\n\u00b5mHg) and temperature -50 \u00b0C, during 48 h. The freeze-dried \n\nsamples were then sintered in an furnace (EDG-1600, EDG) at \n\n1550 \u00b0C, with a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C/min, and dwell time of 2 \n\nh at the maximum temperature. The sintered filters were 20 \u00b1 \n\n0.5 mm in diameter and 12 \u00b1 1 mm thick. \n\nTable 7. 1.

Each analysis \n\nwas performed within 3 min at a shear rate of 0 to 600 s-1, at \n\nroom temperature. The viscosity values were adjusted \n\naccording to the Herschel-Bulkley model (Equation 1) \n\n(Moreno, 2005). \n\n? = ?0 + ??\n???    (1) \n\nwhere ? is the shear stress; ?0, the yield stress; K, the \nconsistency; ?, the shear rate; and n, the flow index.  \n\n\n\n \n\n97 \n\n \n\nThe average solidification rate of each sample could \n\nbe obtained by measuring the height of the samples and \n\ncontrolling the time for complete solidification of the material. \n\nThe final pellets had 20 \u00b1 0.5 mm diameter and 12 \u00b1 1 mm \n\nthickness. They were analyzed by SEM (TM3030, Hitachi). \n\nFor the tests of apparent specific gravity (relative \n\ndensity), water absorption and apparent porosity of the final \n\nfilter, ASTM C20-00 standard was used. The mechanical \n\nstrength was measured through compression tests in a \n\nuniversal machine (DL 20000, Emic) with a load cell of 20 N \n\nand a loading velocity of 0.5 mm/min, according to ASTM \n\nC133-97. \n\nPermeability evaluation of the filters in air was based \n\non Forchheimer\u2019s model (Equation 2 and auxiliary equations), \n\nan empirical relationship to express the parabolic dependence \n\nof pressure drop (?P (Pa)) through the medium with the \n\nresulting face velocity (vs (m/s)): \n\n?P\n\nL\n\n=\n?\n\nk1\nvs +\n\n?\n\nk2\nvs\n\n2    Forchheimer?s equation                        (2) \n\n?P\n\nL\n=\n\n?\n\nk1\nvs    Darcy\n\n?s law \n\n?P =\nPi\n\n2 ?

In Figures 3C and 3D, a \n\nlarger agglomeration of the powder is observed due to its \n\nhigher reactivity corresponding to smaller particle size and \n\nconsequently larger surface area.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7. 3.

In case of \n\nalumina C, the zeta potential is around -77 mV (in acid pH) \n\nand -68 mV (in basic pH). The isoelectric point of the \n\n\n\n \n\n102 \n\n \n\nsuspensions can be observed in pH around 2.5, so that it is \n\nbetter to work with pH range 6-10, as far from pH 2.5 as \n\npossible, because the suspensions are more stable in these \n\nranges. In alumina F, the zeta potential is around -38 mV (in \n\nacid pH) and -45 mV (in basic pH). The isoelectric point of \n\nthe suspensions can be observed in pH around 3.5, it means \n\nthat it is better to work with the same pH range that alumina C \n\nsuspension. The initial suspensions were very stable, with pH \n\n8.5 approximately. \n\n \n\nFigure 7. 4.

The variation in sample height is \n\ndue to the difficulty of accurately controlling the volume of \n\nsuspension cast into the mold. \n\n \n\nFigure 7. 7. Average solidification rate found for alumina \n\nsamples containing 50 wt% coarse (C) and fine (F) fine \n\npowder, respectively. \n\n The difference in the solidification rate is due to the \n\ndifference in particle size between alumina C (2.5 ?m) and F \n\n(0.5 ?m). As the particle size decreases, the solidification rate \n\nalso decreases. At a high freezing rate, ice nucleation is \n\nkinetically more favorable than crystal growth, small pore \n\nformation is more likely. Moreover, the dispersing state of the \n\nsuspension is more likely to be maintained at a high freezing \n\nrate since there is less time for particles to rearrange. Lower \n\nfreezing rate offers more densely packed particles and lower \n\nporosity (Li et al., 2012).Since alumina C has a higher \n\nsolidification rate, the stability of their slurries is higher. \n\n\n\n \n\n106 \n\n \n\n Figure 8 shows the appearance of the sintered filter \n\nsamples. \n\n  \n\nFigure 7. 8. Appearance of the sintered filter samples. \n\n Figure 9 shows the SEM micrographs in samples \n\nwith 50 wt% solids, of the external surface of alumina C50 \n\n(Figure 9A) and alumina F50 (Figure 9B), and of the fractured \n\ninner surface C50 (Figure 9C) and F50 (Figure 9D). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n107 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7. 9. SEM micrographs of the external surface of \n\nsintered alumina samples A) C50 and B) F50, and of the \n\nfractured inner surface of samples C) C50 and D) F50. \n\nA difference in the distribution and shape of the pores \n\nand their connectivity can be observed. The pore size in the \n\nsintered samples, both at the external surface and the fractured \n\ninner surface, varies remarkably. Roughly, pores are ~3 ?m \n\nfor sample C50 and ~7 ?m for sample F50. For the intended \n\napplication, it is desirable to have pores with 3 ?m or less. \n\nThrough the fractured inner surface micrograph, it is possible \n\nto observe the high alignment of pores due to the freeze \n\ncasting. In the sample C50, a more homogeneous structure \n\nwith better densification is observed, while in the sample F50, \n\na less homogeneous structure with the formation of layers can \n\nbe seen. \n\n\n\n \n\n108 \n\n \n\nTable 7. 5.

At around 50 wt%, which \n\nis approximately the percentage chosen for the pellets of this \n\nwork based on experimental results, the porosity of alumina C \n\nis slightly higher than that of alumina F, around 73 and 68%, \n\nrespectively. \n\nAlumina \n\nsample \n\nSolids \n\nload \n\n(wt%) \n\nOpen \n\npores \n\nvolume \n\n(m\u00b3) \n\nApparent \n\nPorosity \n\n(%) \n\nWater \n\nabsorption \n\n(%) \n\nDensity \n\n(g/cm3) \n\nCompressive \n\nstrength (MPa) \n\nC40 40 3.0 ? 10-6 55.5 31.8 3.9 8.6 \u00b1 0.8 \n\nC50 50 3.8 ? 10-6 73.1 69.9 3.9 8.9 \u00b1 0.2 \n\nC60 60 2.1 ? 10-6 61.8 45.7 3.9 0.5 \u00b1 0.4 \n\nC70 70 3.2 ? 10-6 67.1 51.4 3.9 1.9 \u00b1 0.5 \n\nF40 40 2.4 ? 10-6 80.1 102.5 3.9 2.8 \u00b1 0.3 \n\nF50 50 2.9 ? 10-6 67.9 53.7 3.9 11.7 \u00b1 0.5 \n\nF60 60 2.2 ? 10-6 55.6 32.6 3.8 24.8 \u00b1 3.2 \n\nF70 70 1.3 ? 10-6 35.8 14.4 3.9 35.8 \u00b1 2.8 \n\n\n\n \n\n109 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7. 10.

The \n\ndata obtained in this work were inserted in a data map with \n\ndata available in the literature (Figure 13) (Vakifahmetoglu et \n\nal., 2017). \n\n \n\nFigure 7. 13. Location of permeability data of obtained in this \n\nwork in a comprehensive data map available in the literature \n\n(Vakifahmetoglu et al., 2017). \n\nThe values of k1 and k2, obtained in this work were in \n\nthe range of granular filters (ceramic filters able to water \n\npurification) and fibrous aerosol filters (ceramic filters useful \n\nto allow savings in thermal energy with simultaneous removal \n\nof particulate material and chemical contaminants from flue \n\ngases) (Innocentini et al., 2009). In this way, desired \n\npermeability values were obtained here for the application as \n\ndrinking water filters. \n\n7.4 Conclusions \n\n \n\nAs the particle size decreases, the solidification rate \n\nalso decreases, so the solidification rate is lower for fine \n\nalumina, and lower freezing rate offers more densely packed \n\n\n\n \n\n112 \n\n \n\nparticles and lower porosity. Since alumina C has a higher \n\nsolidification rate, the stability of their slurries is higher, since \n\nthere is less time for particles to rearrange.  \n\nThe average pore size is ~3 ?m for sample C50 (more \n\nsuitable for the intended application) and up to 7 ?m for \n\nsample F50. In the sample C50, a more homogeneous \n\nstructure with better densification is observed, at around 50 \n\nwt% solids. The porosity of coarse alumina is slightly higher \n\nthan that of fine alumina, between 73 and 68% respectively. \n\nThe compressive strength of fine alumina reached \n\nhigher values, but with a very low porosity (particularly in \n\nsamples with higher solids loading). Coarse alumina presented \n\na lower mechanical strength, and the porosity remained higher \n\nin all solids concentrations. \n\nConsidering permeability parameters k1 and k2 \n\nobtained in this work, the ceramic filters achieved the desired \n\npermeability values for the application of filters for drinking \n\nwater, regardless of the alumina particle size. \n\nAccording to the experimental data, coarse alumina is \n\nmore suitable for this application, so it was chosen to be used \n\nin the next steps of this work. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n113 \n\n \n\n8 Fabrication of freeze-cast porous \nalumina/kaolinite filters for water purification4 \n\n8.1 Introduction \n\nPorous ceramics is a field of intense research for their \n\nwide applications as catalyst carriers, ceramic filters, sensors, \n\nporous electrodes, biomaterials, and thermal barriers. Various \n\nfabrication methods of porous ceramics have been employed, \n\nincluding different pore-foaming techniques, infiltration of \n\nceramic sol into template structures, gel-casting, slip-casting, \n\nstarch consolidation, microwave processing, electrophoretic \n\ndeposition, and freeze casting (Deville, 2008; Hu et al., 2010). \n\nA comparative study of thirty-seven different water \n\ntreatments indicate that porous ceramic water filters are \n\namong the five most effective treatments for turbidity \n\nreduction and a 99% reduction of bacteria (Lantagne, 2001; \n\nClasen and Boisson, 2006; Simonis and Basson, 2011). \n\nAmong many emerging techniques, freeze casting is \n\nan attractive shaping method for the fabrication of highly \n\nporous and hierarchically organized ceramic structures. \n\n(Zhang et al., 2015; Gaudillere and Serra, 2016). \n\nFreeze casting has received broad attention as a \n\nsimple and versatile fabrication technique of porous \n\nstructures, which generally offers a wider range of pore \n\ncharacteristics compared to other conventional fabrication \n\nmethods such as foam or wood replication, direct foaming, gel \n\ncasting and others. Water and camphene are common solvents \n\nin freeze-casting process (Deville et al., 2007; Fukushima et \n\nal., 2008; Yoon et al., 2008; Li and Li, 2012). \n\nThe technique consists of freezing a ceramic slurry, \n\nfollowed by sublimation of the solvent by freeze drying at \n\nboth low pressure and temperature, and subsequent sintering, \n\n                                                           \n4 Submitted. \n\n\n\n \n\n114 \n\n \n\nleading to a porous structure with unidirectional channels, \n\nwhere pores are a replica of the solvent crystals (Deville, \n\n2008; Gaudillere and Serra, 2016). \n\nThe control of pore structure is very important \n\nbecause of its relation to properties. Many factors, including \n\nthe composition and solid loading of slurry as well as sintering \n\nconditions, influence the microstructure and properties of \n\nporous ceramics fabricated by the freeze casting (Hu et al., \n\n2010). \n\nIn this work, filters composed of alumina and \n\nkaolinite were obtained by freeze casting for water filtration. \n\n8.2 Materials and methods \n\n8.2.1 Raw materials and characterization \n\n \n\nThe powders used as raw material for the porous \n\nfilters were kaolinite (Colorminas) and alumina (UC, CT \n\n3000, Almatis). They were characterized by measuring \n\nparticle size distribution (Nanosizer, Malvern; Lumisizer, \n\nLUM); zeta potential (Stabino, Particle Metrix); TG/DSC \n\n(STA 449 F3 Jupiter, Netzsch); XRD (MiniFlex II, Rigaku); \n\nXRF (WDXRF Axios Max, Panalytical); picnometric density \n\n(Ultrapicnometer 1200 P/N, Quantachrome); and specific \n\nsurface area (BJH, Nova 1200e, Quantachrome). \n\n8.2.2 Formulation, shaping and sintering \n\nThe compositions of the slurries are shown in Table 1. \n\nTo all the samples 1.5 wt% organic dispersant (Darvan, C-N, \n\nVanderbilt) was added, and the balance is distilled water.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n115 \n\n \n\nTable 8. 1. Compositions of the alumina/kaolinite slurries. \n\n \n\nThe shaping of filters was performed by freeze \n\ncasting, and the porosity was adjusted by changing the \n\nconcentration of solids in the slurry. Before freeze casting, the \n\nslurries were mixed in a ball mill during 12 h. Filter samples \n\nof 20 \u00b1 1 mm diameter, 12 \u00b1 2 mm thickness were produced. \n\nFigure 1 shows a schematic representation of the so-called \n\n\u201ccold finger\u201d equipment used in the freeze-casting technique. \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nSample \n\n \n\nTotal solids \n\n(wt%) \n\nAlumina C \n\n(wt%) \n\nKaolinite \n\n(wt%) \n\nA15K25 40 15 25 \n\nA20K30 50 20 30 \n\nA30K20 50 30 20 \n\nA50 50 50 - \n\nA30K25 55 30 25 \n\nA30K30 60 30 30 \n\nA35K25 60 35 25 \n\nA60 60 60 - \n\nA40K25 65 40 25 \n\nA40K30 70 40 30 \n\n\n\n \n\n116 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8. 1. A schematic of the freeze-casting apparatus used \n\nin this work. \n\nThe velocity and the angle that the slurry was cast was \n\nmaintained as constant as possible. After freeze-casting, \n\nsamples were kept in an ultra-freezer at -70 \u00b0C, during 24 h, \n\nand then transferred to a freeze-dryer (Liotop L102, Liobras) \n\nwith pressure &lt;0.39 atm (300 \u00b5mHg) and temperature -50 \u00b0C, \n\nduring 48 h.  \n\nThe freeze-dried samples were then sintered in an \n\nfurnace (EDG-1600, EDG) at 1550 \u00b0C, with a heating rate of \n\n5 \u00b0C/min, and dwell time of 2 h at the maximum temperature. \n\nThe sintered filters were 20 \u00b1 0.5 mm in diameter and 12 \u00b1 1 \n\nmm thick. \n\n8.2.3 Characterization of sintered filters \n\nFor the tests of water absorption, apparent specific \n\ngravity (relative density) and apparent porosity of the final \n\nfilter, ASTM C20-00 standard was used. The mechanical \n\nstrength was measured through compression strength, in the \n\ninstrument DL 20000, Emic, with a load cell of 20 N and a \n\nloading velocity of 0.5 mm/min. ASTM C133-97 standard \n\nwas used. The sintered samples were analyzed by SEM \n\n(TM3030, Hitachi). \n\n\n\n \n\n117 \n\n \n\nPermeability evaluation was based on Forchheimer\u2019s \n\nequation, an empirical relationship well accepted in the \n\nliterature to express the parabolic dependence of pressure drop \n\nthrough the medium with the resulting superficial or face \n\nvelocity. The Darcyan and non-Darcyan permeability \n\nparameters (Innocentini et al., 1999; Moreira et al., 2004; \n\nInnocentini et al., 2010; Vakifahmetoglu et al., 2017) were \n\nestimated. \n\nFilter efficiency was analysed as well (Colilert and \n\nQuanti-Tray/2000, Idexx). To conduct filter efficiency and \n\nturbidity tests, some very dirty and contaminated water \n\nsamples were collected in bottles decontaminated by an \n\nautoclave (Vertical, Phoenix). This water samples was \n\nanalyzed before and after passing through the filter.  \n\nColilert tests simultaneously detect total coliforms and \n\nE. coli in water, based on Idexx\u2019s patented Defined Substrate \n\nTechnology (DST). When total coliforms metabolize \n\nColilert\u2019s nutrient-indicator, ONPG, the sample turns yellow. \n\nWhen E. coli metabolize Colilert\u2019s nutrient-indicator, MUG, \n\nthe sample also fluoresces. \n\nFirstly, the content of one pack of Colilert was added \n\nto a 100 mL water sample in a sterile bottle and shaken until \n\nbeing dissolved. Then, the sample/reagent mixture was set \n\ninto a tray, sealed in an sealer (Quanti-Tray Sealer, 2X, \n\nIdexx), and placed in 35\u00b0C \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C incubator for 24 h. \n\nAfter that, results have been read counting the number \n\nof positive wells (yellow wells = total coliforms, \n\nyellow/fluorescent wells = E. coli) and refer to the MPN table \n\nprovided with the trays to obtain a most probable number. The \n\nfluorescence was read with a 6-watt, 365-nm UV light within \n\n~13 cm of the sample in a dark environment.  \n\nIf the appearance result less yellow than the reference, \n\nit is negative for total coliforms and E. coli; when it is yellow \n\ncomparably to or more intense than the reference, it is positive \n\nhttps://www.idexx.com/water/products/quanti-tray.html\n\n\n \n\n118 \n\n \n\nfor total coliforms; and when it is yellow and fluorescence just \n\nlike or more than the reference, it is positive for E. coli. Figure \n\n2 shows as an example one tray negative for total coliforms \n\nand E. coli, and other positive for total coliforms, respectively. \n\n \n\n(a)                       (b)  \n\nFigure 8. 2.

It is commonly measured in \n\nnephelometric turbidity units (NTU) (WHO, 2008; WHO, \n\n2017b). The turbidity of the dirty (contaminated) and clean \n\n(after filter) water were measured (Turbidimeter, 2100N, \n\nHach) with distilled and tap water to compare the results. \n\n8.3 Results and discussion \n\n8.3.1 Characterization of powders and suspensions \n\n \n\nTable 2 and Figure 3 show characteristic physical \n\nproperties and chemical composition of the kaolinite and \n\nalumina.

Particle size distribution of powders: (a) alumina \n\nand (b) kaolinite. \n\nFigures 4 shows the curve of zeta potential versus pH \n\nof kaolinite and alumina suspensions. In case of kaolinite, the \n\nzeta potential is around -72 mV (in acid pH) and -53 mV (in \n\nbasic pH). The isoelectric point of the suspensions can be \n\nobserved in pH around 2; it means that it is advisable to work \n\nwith pH range 6-10, as far from pH 2 as possible, because the \n\nsuspensions are more stable in these ranges. For alumina, the \n\nzeta potential is around -77 mV (in acid pH) and -68 mV (in \n\nbasic pH). The isoelectric point of the suspensions can be \n\nobserved in pH around 2.5. Thus, the same pH range that \n\nkaolinite suspension is adequate for alumina as well. The \n\nsuspensions at natural pH, around 8.5, were very stable. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n121 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8. 4. Zeta potential versus pH of suspensions: (a) \n\nalumina and (b) kaolinite. \n\nThe thermogravimetric behavior of alumina and \n\nkaolinite is presented in Figure 5A. Kaolinite has a mass loss \n\naround 500 \u00b0C due to the loss of constitutional water \n\n(Albuquerque et al., 2007; Ara\u00fajo et al., 2012).

It is \n\npossible to observe that there is no tendency to increase or \n\ndecrease the density of the samples as the solids content \n\nincrease, this was not expected because the relative density is \n\nthe ratio of bulk density of the sample to the theoretical \n\ndensity of the material, and the bulk density is the ratio of the \n\nsample mass to its total external volume. The theoretical \n\ndensity is usually fixed, but increasing the amount of solids \n\n(with higher density), would increase the mass of the sample, \n\nconsequently increase the relative density, but it must be \n\nconsidered that the samples have different compositions of \n\nsolids, which directly affect the values of theoretical and \n\nrelative densities.  \n\n\n\n \n\n124 \n\n \n\nFigure 7 shows the relationship of porosity and \n\ncompressive strength of samples with only alumina and \n\nalumina/kaolinite mixtures. In this case, the mechanical \n\nstrength is not directly proportional with the apparent \n\nporosity. For example, samples with the lowest and higher \n\nvalues of compression strength present both around 60% \n\napparent porosity. This occurs because of different samples \n\ncompositions.  \n\nFor the filters, a very high mechanical strength is not \n\nnecessary, but a high porosity is essential. Considering this, \n\nthe samples with 40 wt% solids (A15K25) and 50 wt% solids \n\n(A50 and A30K20) have suitable values of compression \n\nstrength and apparent porosity.   \n\n \n\nFigure 8. 7. Porosity versus compressive strength of alumina \n\nand alumina/kaolinite samples. \n\nFigure 8 shows the relationship of the percentage of \n\nthe components (alumina and kaolinite) and the compressive \n\nstrength. \n\n\n\n \n\n125 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8. 8. Effect of the composition (alumina and kaolinite) \n\non the compressive strength. \n\nSamples with around 70 wt% of total solids have high \n\nvalues of compression strength, due to a larger alumina \n\ndensification that occurs during sintering, but they are not \n\nsuitable for this application because their permeability/flow \n\nrate is very less than the necessary for ceramic filters. Samples \n\nwith alumina and kaolinite with similar percentage (around 50 \n\nwt% of total solids) presented the best results of compression \n\nstrength.  \n\n8.3.3 Porosity and permeability of filters \n\nConsidering this and other experimental data, samples \n\nwith suitable values of apparent porosity and compression \n\nstrength were chosen for the tests of permeability, A15K25 \n\nand A30K20.

Samples A50 and A15K24, for \n\nexample, have a similar value of apparent porosity (around \n\n73%) and they have the lowest and the highest values, \n\nrespectively, in both parameters (k1 and k2).  \n\nSamples with the higher values of k1 and k2 were \n\nsamples with alumina and kaolinite mixtures (A15K24 and \n\nA30K20), and their values of apparent porosity are suitable \n\nfor the application aimed in this work. They have been \n\ninserted in a data map with data available in the literature \n\n(Figure 10) (Vakifahmetoglu et al., 2017). \n\n\n\n \n\n128 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8. 10. Location of permeability data of samples \n\nof alumina/kaolinite mixtures obtained in this work in a data \n\nmap (Vakifahmetoglu et al., 2017). \n\nThe values of k1 and k2, obtained in this work, were \n\nbetween values in data of granular filters (ceramic filters able \n\nto water purification) and fibrous aerosol filters (ceramic \n\nfilters useful to allow savings in thermal energy with \n\nsimultaneous removal of particulate material and chemical \n\ncontaminants from flue gases) (Innocentini et al., 2009). Thus, \n\nthe samples achieved the desired permeability values for \n\ndrinking water filtration. \n\nConsidering all the experimental data, sample \n\nA30K20, with 50 wt% solids (alumina 30 wt% and kaolinite \n\n20 wt%) was chosen to be used in the next steps of this work.  \n\nFigure 11 shows SEM micrographs of sample \n\nA30K20 at the external surface (and at the fractured inner \n\nsurface, with different magnifications. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n129 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8. 11. SEM micrographs of sample A30K20: A) \n\nexternal surface; B) fractured inner surface and C) the \n\nfractured inner surface with measurement of the pores \n\nindicated. \n\nIn the micrograph of the external surface, it is possible \n\nto observe a strong characteristic of the freeze-casting process, \n\nthe pores are aligned and directed, with homogeneous \n\ndistribution. In the fractured inner surface, there is a \n\nhomogeneous distribution of pores too, and the average size of \n\npores measured in this micrograph is 1.55 \u00b5m. Comparing \n\nthese pore sizes with the literature, they are suitable for water \n\nfiltration (Lantagne, 2001; Yakub et al., 2012; Youmoue et al., \n\n2017). \n\nAccording to the application map of porosity versus \n\npore or channel size (Figure 12), the sample A30K20, \n\nconsidering porosity and pore size, is within the range of \n\n\u201cpurification and filtration\u201d (Vakifahmetoglu et al., 2017). \n\n\n\n \n\n130 \n\n \n\n8.3.4 Filter biocide efficiency \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8. 12.

The \n\nmost probable numbers of total coliforms and E. coli had a \n\nlarge decrease after the filtration, reaching less than a half of \n\nthe value allowed for animal consumption and less than an \n\neighth of the value allowed for recreation. \n\nTurbidity can be caused by silt, sand and mud; \n\nbacteria and other germs; chemical precipitates (WHO, 2008). \n\nAchieving low turbidities in drinking-water is a proven \n\nindicator of pathogen removal and hence of drinking-water \n\nsafety. Incidents of elevated turbidity have been associated \n\nwith several outbreaks of disease (WHO, 2017a; Mann et al., \n\n2007). \n\nMihelcic et al. (2009) stated that turbidity has a \n\nnegative impact on many water treatment processes in \n\n\n\n \n\n132 \n\n \n\ndifferent ways, including clogging filters and therefore \n\nreducing their effectiveness. They also concluded that \n\nturbidity is easily measurable in the field with the use of a \n\nturbidity tube, and that the pretreatment turbidity limit for \n\nceramic filters is between 15 NTU and 20 NTU. (Mihelcic \n\net al. 2009; Salvinelli et al., 2016). \n\nThe dirty/contaminated sample for the test of filter \n\nefficiency and turbidity was collected from a stream at UFSC. \n\nIts turbidity was 17.41 \u00b1 2.42 NTU, in the range of the \n\npretreatment turbidity limit for ceramic filters. Figure 13 \n\nshows the turbidity of the water before (dirty/contaminated) \n\n(13A) and then of passing through the filter pellet (clean) \n\n(13B). \n\n \n\nFigure 8. 13. Turbidity of the water, A) before \n\n(dirty/contaminated) and B) then of passing through the filter \n\npellet (clean). \n\nTable 7 shows the results of turbidity of the dirty \n\n(contaminated), clean (after filter) water, tap water and \n\ndistilled water.  \n\n\n\n \n\n133 \n\n \n\nTable 8. 7.

Ideally, median turbidity should be below 1 \n\nnephelometric turbidity unit (NTU) (WHO, 1997). However, \n\n5 NTU is the minimum turbidity measurable with simple \n\nequipment (turbidity tube), so this level may be used in \n\npractice. If turbidity exceeds 5 NTU, then the water should be \n\ntreated to remove suspended matter before disinfection \n\n(WHO, 2017b). Most of papers/guidelines affirms that \n\ndrinking water should have a turbidity of 5 NTU or less \n\n(Brazilian Health Ministry, 2004; CONAMA, 2008; WHO, \n\n2008; WHO, 2017b). \n\nConsidering this, our sample, after pass through the \n\nfilter, has a turbidity of 0.56 \u00b1 0.31 NTU, below the value \n\nallowed, below even the turbidity of tap water and close to the \n\nturbidity of distilled water. Attesting the efficiency of our \n\nfilter considering the turbidity parameter. \n\n \n\n8.4 Conclusions \n\n \n\nSamples with only alumina C have high values of \n\ncompression strength, but low values of permeability/flow \n\nrate. Samples with alumina C and kaolinite with around \n\n\n\n \n\n134 \n\n \n\n50wt% of total solids have best results of compression \n\nstrength with acceptable value of permeability/flow rate. \n\nThe higher values of k1 and k2 were of samples with \n\nalumina and kaolinite, with suitable values of apparent \n\nporosity and a homogeneous distribution of pores, with \n\naverage pore size of 1.55 \u00b5m, with pores between 1.04 and \n\n2.73 \u00b5m. \n\nThe most probable numbers of total coliforms and E. \n\ncoli had a large decrease after the filtration, reaching less than \n\na half of the minimum value allowed for animal consumption \n\nand less than an eighth of the value allowed for recreation. \n\nThe dirty/contaminated water, after pass through the \n\nfilter, had a turbidity of 0.56 \u00b1 0.31 NTU, below the value \n\nallowed, attesting the efficiency of our filter considering the \n\nturbidity parameter. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n135 \n\n \n\n9 Freeze-cast porous ceramic filters impregnated \nwith silver nanoparticles5 \n\n9.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nNanomaterials are systems in which at least one \n\ndimension is 1\u2013100 nm in length. They present particular \n\nphysical and chemical properties and can be used in numerous \n\napplications. Particularly silver, in the form of nanoparticles, \n\nhas shown highly efficient antimicrobial properties (Singh and \n\nNalwa, 2011; Dash et al., 2012; Leon-Silva et al., 2016; D\u00edaz-\n\nSoler et al., 2017). \n\nSilver is often used as an antibacterial agent to \n\nprovide a sanitary environment for the wound healing process. \n\nIt is considered as one of the most frequently used \n\nantibacterial substances before the invention of antibiotics. \n\nThe multiplicity of silver\u2019s bactericidal mechanisms gives it a \n\nwide range of effective applications in the inhibition of \n\nbacterial growth. The introduction of silver nanoparticles \n\n(AgNP) has allowed the scientific community to enhance \n\nantibacterial properties. Moreover, the increased surface area \n\nof nanoparticles induces an increased rate of interaction \n\nbetween the test subjects and ionic silver (Alexander, 2009; \n\nNam et al., 2015; Bal et al., 2015; Dong et al., 2016; \n\nMckevica et al., 2016; Amadio et al., 2017). \n\nSpectrophotometric analysis is one of the most widely \n\nused analytical techniques available. The largest use of UV-\n\nVis absorption spectroscopy lies in its application to \n\nquantitative analysis. The reasons for this stem from the ease \n\nwith which most spectrophotometric measurements can be \n\nmade, their sensitivity and precision, and the relatively low \n\ncost of instrument purchase and operation (Frank, 1997; \n\nFereja, et. al, 2015).  \n\n                                                           \n5 Accepted by Brazilian Journal of Chemical Engineering. \n\n\n\n \n\n136 \n\n \n\nTo quantify AgNP in suspension, a technique with a \n\nvery low limit of detection is necessary, such as graphite \n\nfurnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS). Graphite \n\nfurnace is generally considered an ultratrace and microtrace \n\nanalytical technique with limits of detection in the low \n\npicogram range, precision of a few percent (relative standard \n\ndeviation) and a dynamic range of about three orders of \n\nmagnitude. In addition to its high sensitivity, it is unique in its \n\nability to handle microsamples including aqueous solutions, \n\nviscous liquids, slurries and even solids. GFAAS is an atomic \n\nspectroscopic technique in which a small sample is placed \n\ninside a graphite tube that is then resistively heated to \n\naccomplish sample desolvation (for liquid samples), ashing or \n\ncharring (to decompose the sample and volatilize some of the \n\nmatrix) and finally atomization (Holcombe, 2006). \n\nStoimenov and co-workers (2002) demonstrated that \n\nhighly reactive metal oxide nanoparticles exhibit excellent \n\nbiocidal action against Gram-positive and Gram-negative \n\nbacteria (Stoimenov et al. 2002; Sondi 2004). One way to test \n\nthe bactericidal properties in the filter pellets is the Disc \n\nDiffusion Test (also known as Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing). \n\nThis is a test of the antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria. It uses \n\nantibiotic-impregnated pellets to test the extent to which \n\nbacteria are affected by those antibiotics. In this test, pellets \n\ncontaining antibiotic are placed on an agar plate where \n\nbacteria, Gram-positive or Gram-negative, have been placed, \n\nand the plate is left to incubate. In these tests, if an antibiotic \n\nstops the bacteria from growing or kills the bacteria, there will \n\nbe an area around the pellet where the bacteria have not grown \n\nenough to be visible, it is called a zone or halo of inhibition \n\n(Mohanty 2010; Shahzada et al. 2014). \n\nNeomycin, the antibiotic used, is an aminoglycoside \n\nantibiotic produced during fermentation of Streptomyces \n\nfradiae with a high antimicrobial efficacy, and broad \n\nantibacterial spectrum. It inhibits the growth of Gram-negative \n\n\n\n \n\n137 \n\n \n\nand Gram-positive bacteria (Adams et al. 1996; Chang-Chien \n\net al. 2017). \n\nGram-positive bacteria are bacteria that give a positive \n\nresult in the Gram stain test. Gram stain differentiates bacteria \n\nby the chemical and physical properties of their cell walls by \n\ndetecting peptidoglycan, which is present in the cell wall of \n\nGram-positive bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria retain the \n\ncrystal violet dye, and thus are stained violet, while the Gram-\n\nnegative bacteria do not; after washing, a counterstain is \n\nadded (commonly safranin or fuchsine) that will stain these \n\nGram-negative bacteria a pink color (Holt 1994). \n\nEnterococcus faecalis is formerly classified as part of \n\nthe group D Streptococcus system \u2013 is a Gram-positive, \n\ncommensal bacterium inhabiting the gastrointestinal tracts of \n\nhumans and other mammals. It is usually outnumbered by \n\nstrictly anaerobic bacteria (Russell et al. 2001; Ryan et al. \n\n2004). \n\nEscherichia coli, E. coli, is a Gram-negative, \n\nanaerobic, rod-shaped, coliform bacterium of the genus \n\nEscherichia that is commonly found in the lower intestine of \n\nwarm-blooded organisms (endotherms) (Singleton 1999; \n\nOlivier et al. 2010). \n\nIn this work, an innovative approach for impregnation \n\nof porous ceramic filters, which can be used for water or \n\nwastewater treatment is proposed. Filter elements are \n\nproduced by freeze casting, in which AgNP are impregnated \n\nin order to optimize reactive surface area and to enhance \n\nbactericidal effects. \n\n9.2 Materials and methods \n\n9.2.1 Raw materials and fabrication of filters \n\nPorous ceramic filters samples (20 mm diameter, 15 \n\nmm thickness) of alumina (CT 3000, Almatis) and kaolinite \n\n\n\n \n\n138 \n\n \n\n(Colorminas) were produced from mixtures of 30 wt% \n\nalumina, 20 wt%, kaolinite, 1.5 wt% Darvan C-N (Vanderbilt) \n\nand 38.5 wt% distilled. The slurry was homogenized, freeze-\n\ncast, dried and sintered, as described in the flow chart in \n\nFigure 1, to produce porous filter elements.  \n\nSilver nanoparticles were analyzed by Transmission \n\nElectron Microscope (TEM, JEM 1011, JEOL), with \n\nmaximum acceleration voltage, 100 kV and magnification \n\nrange, 800? to 600,000?. Particle size distribution was \n\nmeasured by direct light scattering (Zetasizer, Nanosizer \u2013 ZS, \n\nMalvern). \n\n\n\n \n\n139 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9. 1. Flowchart of processing of filter elements \n\nincluding impregnation of silver nanoparticles (AgNP). \n\n\n\n \n\n140 \n\n \n\n9.2.2 Filter impregnation with silver nanoparticles and \ncharacterization \n\n \n\nThe samples were impregnated with an aqueous \n\nsolution of silver nanoparticles (TNS, 1000 \u00b5g/L, pH 4) by \n\ndip coating in a sealed borosilicate glass beaker, during 24 h. \n\nAfter that, a thermal treatment was performed in a resistive \n\nfurnace (J 200, Jung) at a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C/min and dwell \n\ntime of 2 h at 200 \u00b0C, to fix the silver nanoparticles on the \n\nsample surface (Amadio et al., 2017).  \n\nThe impregnated samples were coated with a thin \n\nlayer of gold and characterized in a scanning electron \n\nmicroscope and energy dispersive x- ray spectroscopy \n\n(SEM/EDS, TM3030, Hitachi). EDS was used to provide \n\nrapid semi-quantitative analysis of elemental composition and \n\nto form map profiles, showing the AgNP distribution at the \n\nsample top and fracture surfaces. \n\nTo test the efficiency of impregnation, leaching tests \n\nwere performed using: \n\n? Mechanical stirring (overhead stirrer mixer) at 2000 rpm \nduring 1 h (MS 1); 2 h (MS 2); 3 h, resting of 24 h and \n\nmore 3 h (MS 3-24).  \n\n? Centrifugation at 3600 rpm during 15 min (CE 15) and 30 \nmin (CE 30). \n\n? Ultrasonic bath during 5 min (UL 5) and 15 min (UL 15). \n \n\nTo quantify silver in the leached water UV/VIS (UV-\n\n1800, Shimadzu), at wavelength of 405 nm (Zamiri, et. al, \n\n2012; Vasireddy, et. al, 2012; Guzm\u00e1n, et. al, 2009), and \n\ngraphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (PinA Acle \n\n900T, Perkin Elmer) with limit of detection of 0.35 ng/L and \n\nlimit of quantitation of 1.16 ng/L were employed. \n\n\n\n \n\n141 \n\n \n\nThe efficiency of impregnation was estimated as a \n\ncorrelation of the amount of nanosilver fixed in the sample \n\nand to that leached in water, as shown in Table 1. \n\nTable 9. 1. Concentration of silver nanoparticles and the \n\ncorresponding absorbance. \n\nConcentration (g/L) Abs \n\n0.5 0.06 \n\n1 0.07 \n\n2 0.13 \n\n3 0.16 \n\n4 0.19 \n\n5 0.16 \n\n6 0.21 \n\n7 0.28 \n\n8 0.37 \n\n9 0.45 \n\n10 0.54 \n\n11 0.60 \n\n12 0.69 \n\n13 0.76 \n\n14 0.84 \n\n \n\nTo obtain the linearity, the absorbance was plotted \n\nversus the concentration (g/mL) to obtain the Beer-Lambert \n\ncalibration curve (Figure 2). The equation for the calibration \n\ncurve was Y = 0.0778X - 0.2473, where Y is the absorbance \n\nand X is the concentration in g/L. The value of correlation \n\ncoefficient (R2) was 0.9979. The result reveals that there is a \n\nstrong linear relationship between the concentration of the test \n\nsample and the absorbance values over the concentration \n\nrange 5 to 14 g/L (Figure 3). The second curve has the \n\nlinearity and accuracy necessary but the range of analyte is not \n\nsuitable, how is possible to observe in Figure 4, A is the color \n\n\n\n \n\n142 \n\n \n\nof the sample with the analyte of the leached water and B is \n\nthe color of solution which concentrations were in linearity \n\ncurve. The solution A, and all the others leached waters were \n\nanalyzed but their absorbance were less than 0.0045, so it is \n\nnot in the range of the curve of linearity. Then it is possible \n\naffirm that the quantity of silver nanoparticle is below \n\ndetection limit, so the quantity of AgNP are very small. \n\n \n\nFigure 9. 2. Absorbance was plotted versus the concentration \n\n(g/mL) to obtain the Beer-Lambert calibration curve. \n\n \n\nFigure 9. 3. Beer-Lambert calibration curve for AgNP in \n\nwater at wavelength of 405 nm over the range of 5 to 14 g/L \n\nAgNP. \n\n\n\n \n\n143 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9. 4. Color of our samples, A) solution with analyte of \n\nthe leached water and B) solution which concentrations were \n\nin linearity curve. \n\nTo analyze the bactericidal effects of AgNP in the \n\nfilter pellets, the Disc Diffusion Test (Kirby-Bauer antibiotic \n\ntesting) was used according to a standard approved by the \n\nNCCLS (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory \n\nStandards) (NCCLS, 2000). Two bacteria with distinct \n\ncharacteristics were chosen : Escherichia coli (Gram-\n\nnegative) and Enterococcus faecalis (Gram-positive). \n\nPellets containing antibiotic (Neomycin) were placed \n\non an agar plate with each bacteria type. The plate is left to \n\nincubate during 24 h at 35 \u00b0C. It was necessary to test if the \n\nantibiotic stops the bacteria from growing or kills them. The \n\nresults show a halo of inhibition if silver has bactericidal \n\neffects. \n\n\n\n \n\n144 \n\n \n\n9.3 Results and Discussion \n\n9.3.1 Characterization of silver nanoparticles \n\nThe particle size distribution of AgNP was determined \n\nby DLS (Figure 5). The average size is around 46 nm in the \n\nthree measures, where some agglomeration of the particles in \n\nthe micrometric range can be seen. \n\n \n\nFigure 9. 5. Size distribution of AgNP analyzed by DLS. \n\n            Figure 6 shows the curve of zeta potential versus \n\npH of silver nanoparticle concentrated (AgNP-C) and \n\ndiluted (AgNP-D) suspensions. In the diluted suspension, \n\nthe pH is higher (around 8), it has a broader range of zeta \n\npotential than the concentrated suspension, which has a \n\npH 4 and a zeta potential of -29.6 mV. The isoelectric \n\npoint of the suspensions can be observed at pH around \n\n8.5. Thus, it is advisable to work with basic or acid \n\nsuspensions, as far from pH 8.5 as possible, because the \n\nsuspensions are more stable in these regions. \n\n\n\n \n\n145 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9. 6. Zeta potential versus pH, showing the isoelectric \n\npoint of the silver nanoparticles concentrated and diluted \n\nsuspensions. \n\nNanosilver particles were analyzed by TEM, as shown \n\nin the micrographs in Figure 7. \n\n \n\nFigure 9. 7. TEM micrographs of AgNP at different \n\nmagnifications and electron diffraction pattern. \n\n\n\n \n\n146 \n\n \n\nDifferent spots or textures are seen due to the \n\ndifference in crystallographic orientation or interference. \n\nUsing an image processing software (ImageJ, version k 1.45), \n\nsome particle considered in the same crystallographic \n\norientation were measured, and the diameter size of these \n\nparticles was between 10 nm and 16 nm, being the average \n\naround 13 nm. Figure 7D shows the distance between the \n\ntransmitted point and the diffraction point, which determines \n\nthe diffraction pattern.  \n\n9.3.2 Characterization of AgNP-impregnated filters \n\n \n\nThe final appearance of the AGNP-impregnated filter \n\nelements is shown in Figure 8. \n\n \n\nFigure 9. 8. Final appearance of the sample impregnated with \n\nnano-Ag. \n\nThe impregnated samples were further characterized \n\nby a scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive x- \n\nray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). Figure 9 shows the \n\nmicrographs of the outer and fractured surfaces of the \n\nsamples. Figure 9A shows the external surface of the \n\nimpregnated sample, and Figure 9B, the fractured sample. It is \n\ndifficult to observe the nanoparticles in the structure due to \n\ntheir small size; in Figure 9C, fractured inner surface, it is \n\npossible to notice some agglomeration. \n\n\n\n \n\n147 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9. 9. SEM micrographs of the outer and inner \n\n(fractured) surfaces of impregnated samples: A) outer, B) \n\ninner and C) inner in detail. \n\nTo attest if this agglomeration is silver, EDS was used \n\nto provide rapid semiquantitative analysis of elemental \n\ncomposition. Figure 10 shows the micrograph with the spot \n\nfrom where EDS was performed. Firstly, a square area was \n\nchosen where a homogeneous distribution was present (Figure \n\n11A); then, a dot corresponding to an area of agglomerated \n\nnanoparticles was also analyzed (Figure 11 B), Table 2 shows \n\nthe results of elemental analysis. \n\n\n\n \n\n148 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9. 10.

The texture of the porous ceramic filter \n\nsurfaces impregnated with silver nanoparticles is shown in \n\nFigures 12 and 13, outer and inner bulk (fractured) surfaces, \n\nrespectively. It is observed that the silver nanoparticles have a \n\nhomogeneous distribution along both outer and fractured \n\nsurfaces of the sample and the amount of nanosilver is \n\napparently higher in the inner part (bulk) of the fractured \n\nsample.  \n\n \n\nFigure 9. 12.

Amount of silver in the different leached samples \n\nas detected by GFAAS. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSample Concentration Ag (\u00b5g/L) \n\nMS 1 0.0096 \n\nMS 2 0.0097 \n\nMS 3-24 0.0178 \n\nCE 15 0.0074 \n\nCE 30 0.0175 \n\nUL 5 0.0457 \n\nUL 15 0.0829 \n\n\n\n \n\n152 \n\n \n\nGFAAS was applied to quantify silver nanoparticles \n\nwith a lower limit of detection, as seen in Table 3. The results \n\nconfirm that there is a very small amount of silver in the \n\nleached water. The initial suspension concentration was 1000 \n\n\u00b5g/L; so that it is estimated that more than 99% of silver \n\nnanoparticles was fixed in the filter pellets. \n\nAccording to CONAMA (Resolution 396/2008), the \n\nMaximum Allowed Values (MAV) for metallic silver is 100 \n\nand 50 \u00b5g/L for human consumption and recreation, \n\nrespectively. \n\nHigher levels of silver, up to 0.1 mg/L (a \n\nconcentration that gives a total dose over 70 years of 10 g), \n\ncould then be tolerated without risk to health (WHO, 2014). \n\nConsidering those values, the quantity of silver in the leached \n\nwater is well below the values allowed and it is without any \n\nrisk to health. \n\nThe Disc Diffusion Test (Kirby-Bauer antibiotic \n\ntesting) was performed to detect if the silver nanoparticles \n\npresent inhibitory and bactericidal effects. Table 4 shows the \n\nresults of this test. \n\nTable 9. 4. Inhibition halo in the AgNP-impregnated filter \n\nelements as detected by the Disc Diffusion Test. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBacteria Samples Inhibition halo \n\nGram-negative \n\n(Escherichia \n\ncoli) \n\nNeomycin Present \n\nPellet without Ag Absent \n\nPellet with Ag Present \n\nGram-positive \n\n(Enterococcus \n\nfaecalis) \n\nNeomycin Present \n\nPellet without Ag Absent \n\nPellet with Ag Present \n\n\n\n \n\n153 \n\n \n\nIn this test, the antibiotic and the nanosilver \n\nimpregnated samples stopped the bacteria from growing or \n\neven killed the bacteria, because there was an area around the \n\npellets where the bacteria have not grown enough to be \n\nvisible, i.e., the halo of inhibition was present. In the pellets \n\nwithout nanosilver, the halo of inhibition was absent. \n\nAccordingly, the filter pellets impregnated with AgNP showed \n\nstrong inhibitory and bactericidal effects. \n\n9.4 Conclusions \n\nSilver nanoparticles impregnation was very efficient, \n\nconsidering that around 99% of the initial silver was fixed in \n\nthe filter elements through an easy method of impregnation, \n\nsuch as dipping. Graphite furnace atomic absorption \n\nspectrometry was a suitable technique to quantify the silver in \n\nthe leached water. \n\nThe silver nanoparticles were homogeneously \n\ndistributed along the entire structure, both at the outer and at \n\nthe inner bulk fracture surface. SEM/EDS detected the \n\npresence of nanosilver throughout the samples. \n\nThe filter elements showed a strong bactericidal \n\neffect, according to the Disc Diffusion Test, which indicated \n\nthe presence of a halo of inhibition in the pellets impregnated \n\nwith silver nanoparticles and absence of this halo in the pellets \n\nwithout silver. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n154 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n155 \n\n \n\n10 General conclusions \n\n \n\nComposites of bentonite/nanoparticles were \n\nsuccessfully obtained by simple impregnation procedures, \n\nwhich can be performed either by imbibition or by dipping, \n\nwith efficiency after washing with water over 99% in the case \n\nof nano-Ag, and over 90% for Au, Pd and TiO2 nanoparticles. \n\nAlternatively, porous pressed filters with only kaolinite \n\nhave low porosity and low compression strength; samples \n\nwith only alumina have a high densification and very low \n\nporosity (including samples with rice husks). Samples with \n\nkaolinite and alumina have a good strength after contact with \n\nwater, but the permeability and flow rate did not reach enough \n\nvalues for a water filtration, with less than 0.01 l/h. Thus, \n\npressed alumina or kaolinite filters were not suitable for the \n\nintended application. \n\nAs an innovative approach, freeze-cast alumina with \n\nvarying particle sizes were tested as water filters. Coarse \n\nalumina presented a higher solidification rate than fine \n\nalumina. The pore size for sample A50, around 3 ?m, was \n\nmore suitable for water purification. \n\nThe compression strength of fine alumina reached \n\nhigher values, but with very low porosity. Conversely, coarse \n\nalumina presented a lower range of compressive strength, and \n\nthe porosity remained higher in all the solids loads. \n\nConsidering permeability parameters k1 and k2 obtained \n\nin this work, the porous alumina samples achieved the desired \n\npermeability values for water filtration, regardless the particle \n\nsize. According to the experimental data, coarse alumina is \n\nmore suitable for this application than fine alumina. \n\nSamples with coarse alumina and kaolinite with around \n\n50 wt% total solids presented the highest results of \n\ncompression strength, an acceptable value of \n\n\n\n \n\n156 \n\n \n\npermeability/flow rate, higher values of k1 and k2, and suitable \n\nvalues of apparent porosity with a homogeneous distribution \n\nof pores. According to the experimental data, samples with \n\ncoarse alumina and kaolinite are more suitable for this \n\napplication. \n\nThe number of total coliforms and E. coli had a large \n\ndecrease after filtration, reaching less than a half of the \n\nminimum value allowed for animal consumption and less than \n\none eighth of the value allowed for recreation. \n\nThe contaminated water, after passing through the filter, \n\nhad a turbidity of 0.56 \u00b1 0.31 NTU, below the value allowed, \n\nattesting the efficiency of filter considering the turbidity \n\nparameter. \n\nSilver nanoparticles impregnation was very efficient, \n\nwith around 99% of the initial silver fixed in the filter \n\nelements, and with nanosilver homogeneously distributed \n\nalong the entire structure. The silver impregnated filters \n\nshowed a strong bactericidal effect. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n157 \n\n \n\n11 References \n\n \n\nABNT, 1981.
