GON\u00c7ALVES\n\nDepartamento de Geologia/UFOP, campus \u2013 Morro do Cruzeiro, s/n, 3540-0000 Ouro Preto, MG, Brasil\n\nManuscript received on September 13, 2009; accepted for publication on December 6, 2010\n\nABSTRACT\n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated the effect of a second phase on the distribution of fluid phase and dissolution of\n\nquartz grains. However, as most observations came from aggregates deformed under hydrostatic stress conditions and\n\nmica-bearing quartz rocks, 3-D distribution of pores on quartz-quartz (QQB) and quartz-hematite boundaries (QHB)\n\nhas been studied. Several fracture surfaces oriented according to finite strain ellipsoid were analyzed. The pore distri-\n\nbution characterizes the porosity and grain shape as highly anisotropic, which results from the nature and orientation\n\nof boundaries. QHB have physical/chemical properties very different from QQB, once the hematite plates have strong\n\neffect on wetting behavior of fluid, likewise micas in quartzites. They are pore-free flat surfaces, normal to compres-\n\nsion direction, suggesting that they were once wetted with a continuous fluid film acting as faster diffusion pathway.\n\nAt QQB, the pores are faceted, isolated, close to its edges reflecting the crystallographic control and an intercon-\n\nnected network of fluid along grain junctions. The QQB facing the extension direction are sites of fluid concentration.\n\nAs consequence, the anisotropic dissolution and grain growth were responsible for the formation of hematite plates\n\nand tabular quartz grains significantly contributing for the generation of the foliation observed in the studied rocks.\n\nKey words: deformation mechanisms, fluid distribution, grain growth, porosity, solution transfer.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSeveral studies based on observations (Mancktelow\n1987, Hippertt 1993, 1994) and experiments (Hickman\nand Evans 1995, Farver and Yund 1999) have demon-\nstrated that the presence of a second phase has a pro-\nfound effect on the anisotropic distribution of fluid\nphase and the dissolution of quartz minerals. Most ex-\nperiments carried out in aggregates deformed under\nconditions of hydrostatic stress have demonstrated that\nfluid distributions are in textural equilibrium, showing\nequilibrated pore geometries (e.g. Watson and Brenan\n1987). These studies have presented wetting and non-\nwetting fluid distributions (interconnected tubules along\ngrain edges and isolated pores, respectively) as well\nas continuous fluid film in equilibrium with the solid\n\nCorrespondence to: Cristiane C.

However, for rocks naturally\ndeformed, data have shown a heterogeneous fluid dis-\ntribution, out of textural equilibrium, due to highly ani-\nsotropic interfacial energy in the polymineralic aggreg-\nates (Spry 1983, Urai et al. 1986, Hippertt 1994, Jin\net al. 1994, Daines and Kohlstedt 1997). In addition,\nthe deformation-induced change in fluid distribution\nmay have a profound effect on the rock strength, defor-\nmation mechanism and fluid transport (Hirth and Tullis\n1991, Tullis et al. 1996).\n\nHowever, the majority of the observations in nat-\nurally deformed rocks have been made exclusively on\nmica-bearing quartz rocks (e.g. Hippertt 1994). Thus, in\nthis study samples of iron oxide bearing quartz rocks\nfrom Paleoproterozoic banded iron formations were se-\nlected to investigate the influence of a second phase on\nthe distribution of aqueous fluid, as inferred from the\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2011) 83 (3)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2011/7/6 \u2014 16:23 \u2014 page 876 \u2014 #2\n\n876 LEONARDO LAGOEIRO and CRISTIANE C.

The samples were carefully pre-\npared to ensure that fractures would occur exclusively\nalong grain boundaries. Then, several fracture surfaces\ncarefully oriented with respect to the finite strain ellip-\nsoid were observed in the scanning electron microscope\n(SEM). The studied banded iron formations occur in\nthe southern part of the Brazilian Archean-Proterozoic\nshield, S\u00e3o Francisco Craton (Fig. 1). In this location\nthere is an extensive iron ore deposit, in the region\ntermed Quadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero \u2013 QF, which is part of a\ngranite-greenstone terrain of Archaean-Proterozoic age\n(Alkmim and Marshak 1998).\n\nGEOLOGICAL SETTING\n\nThe studied quartz-iron oxide samples came from Paleo-\nproterozoic iron formations from QF area (Fig. 1). The\nregion is characterized as a classical granite-greenstone\nterrain, composed mainly of a sequence of metavol-\ncanic and metasedimentary rocks, surrounded by a 2.9-\n3.2 Ga gneiss/migmatite complex (Teixeira et al. 1989,\nMachado et al. 1996), and Archaen plutons (2.7-2.6 Ga)\n(Teixeira 1985, Machado and Carneiro 1992, Marshak\net al. 1992, Carneiro et al. 1994, 1995, Machado et al.\n1996). According to the referred authors, it is a com-\nplex association of granite and gneiss-migmatite rocks,\ncovered by a meta-volcanic-sedimentary sequence (Rio\ndas Velhas Supergroup). Discordantly overlying this\nbasement sequence, there are metasedimentary rocks\nof paleo-Proterozoic age, which comprise the Minas\nSupergroup (Carneiro et al. 1995, Noce 1995, Renger\net al. 1995, Alkmim and Marshak 1998). The overlying\nPaleoproterozoic units are composed of metasediments\nincluding schist, quartzite, carbonate rocks and a sev-\neral hundred-meter thick unit of banded iron formations\n(BIF\u2019s). These units were deposited ca 2.5 Ga (Babinsk\net al. 1993).\n\nThe supracrustal sequences have been intensively\nfolded in a complex geometry consisting of kilometer-\nscale synclines and anticlines surrounded by domes of\ngneiss/migmatite (Marshak et al. 1992, Alkmim and\nMarshak 1998). The contacts between the domes and\nthe supracrustal rocks are generally marked by low to\nmedium grade metamorphic shear zones (Hippertt et al.\n1992). In several of these contacts thermal aureoles\n\nare observed, with the development of porphyroblasts\nin the relatively cooler supracrustal rocks (Herz 1970,\n1978, Jordt-Evangelista et al. 1992). Some authors have\nproposed a compartmentation of QF region according\nto the magnitude of deformation (Rosi\u00e8re et al. 2001)\nand metamorphic grade (Pires 1995). According to these\nauthors, in the west part of the QF area, the less de-\nformed rocks outcrop and metamorphic studies indicate\na metamorphism not higher than the low greenschist\nfacies, reaching temperatures up to 350?C. On the other\nhand, in the eastern domains, rocks are intensely de-\nformed and mineral association in some country rocks\nsuggests temperatures around 500?C, compatible with\na metamorphism of higher greenschist to lower amphi-\nbolite facies. Between these two extremes, structures and\nmetamorphic mineral association indicate an interme-\ndiate strain and metamorphic grade (Pires 1995, Rosi\u00e8re\net al. 2001).\n\nThe BIF\u2019s occur all over the QF area and mark a\nconsistent and pervasive unit consisting in an impor-\ntant stratigraphic marker. Basically, the BIF\u2019s consist\nof banded rocks of quartz and iron oxide layers, with\ntabular to lens shape, alternating rhythmically. They\nshow pervasive foliation, coincident with the banding,\ndefined by well-developed platy hematite. The thickness\nof individual layers varies from few to several millime-\nters and the major constituents are quartz, magnetite and\nhematite. The studied samples were collected in the east\nboundary of QF (Fig. 1) region. There are several shear\nzones developed parallel to the compositional layering,\nwhose kinematic indicators, such as S-C foliation, are\nall consistent with an interlayer reverse shear sense with\nup-dip mineral lineation. The quartz domains are lens\nshaped and frequently display a sigmoidal and asym-\nmetrical geometry, most of them parallel to the compo-\nsitional layering (Fig. 2a).\n\nMETHODS\n\nThe microstructural features were described by optical\nmicroscopy using regular thin sections. The quartz c-\naxes orientations were measured in a U-stage mounted\non an optical microscope (Passchier and Trouw 1996).\nThe orientation pattern of hematite grains was obtained\nusing the SEM-EBSD system (Prior et al. 1999). In\naddition, we have used SEM techniques to analyze the\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2011) 83 (3)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2011/7/6 \u2014 16:23 \u2014 page 877 \u2014 #3\n\nSEM OBSERVATION OF GRAIN BOUNDARY STRUCTURES 877\n\nFig. 1 \u2013 Simplified geological map of the Quadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero region in the southern margin of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton (SFC).

They are commonly found close to the bound-\naries of the host quartz.\n\nBoth, the hematite grains in the matrix (hematite\nplates) and the included hematite grains (hematite plate-\nlets) have a strong shape preferred orientation (Fig. 2d)\nas well as crystallographic orientation with their c-axes\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2011) 83 (3)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2011/7/6 \u2014 16:23 \u2014 page 879 \u2014 #5\n\nSEM OBSERVATION OF GRAIN BOUNDARY STRUCTURES 879\n\nconcentrated at the foliation pole (Fig. 3a). Quartz\ngrains in quartz-rich layers have a wide range of sizes\nand shapes. There is a polymodal distribution of sizes\nbetween 20 ?m and 2 mm. Shapes vary from tabular\n(aspect ratio up to 10:1) to granular. Grain boundaries\nare also characterized by a variety of geometries. Some\ngrains have straight boundaries (Fig. 2e), whereas others\nhave slight to pronounced curvatures (Fig. 2f). Several\nobserved grains have irregular boundaries and the lobate\nshapes predominate. Irregular boundaries preferentially\noccur on faces at a high angle to the direction of max-\nimum elongation ( X -axis of the finite strain ellipsoid),\non which small inclusions of euhedral hematite grains\noccur. On the other hand, boundaries of inequant quartz\ngrains normal to the maximum compression tend to be\nstraight and free of inclusions.\n\nMICROFABRIC DATA\n\nIn general, quartz grains have strong c-axis preferred ori-\nentation with a maximum close to Y -axis (Fig. 3b), dif-\nferently from orientation pattern observed for hematite\ngrains (Fig. 3a). Undulose extinctions consist of broad\nstripes oriented obliquely to the compositional banding.\nIn addition, the grain boundaries are also preferentially\noriented. The pole figure and rose diagram in Figure 3\nshow the orientation pattern of grain boundary segments\naccording to sample reference system and black stripes\nin the rose diagram highlight the segments parallel and\nsub-parallel to foliation pole (Z direction). The grain\nboundary segments are preferentially oriented sub-par-\nallel to the rock foliation and, secondarily, they are ori-\nented normal to this structure (Fig. 3c, detail in the left\nside). As the segments sub-parallel to Z direction must\nrepresent grain boundaries parallel and sub-parallel to\nYZ section or those normal to direction of maximum\nextension (X direction), their orientation according to\nquartz crystal reference system was determined. Thus,\nthe angles between the grain boundary pole represented\nby the segments highlighted and the c-axes of the grains\nlimited for them were determined (Fig. 3c, histogram).\n\nThe distribution of angles between c-axes and grain\nboundary poles show a preponderance of values between\n50? and 80?, although the higher concentrations are ob-\nserved between 50 and 55?. Angular relations higher\nthan 80? also occur and those shorter than 33? are scarce.\n\nAccording to quartz crystal reference system (Gon\u00e7alves\nand Lagoeiro 2009a), the observed distribution pattern\ncharacterizes the quartz-quartz grain boundaries normal\nto direction of maximum extension (sub-parallel to YZ\nsections) as surfaces belonging to rhombohedral and\ntrapezohedral girdles, preferentially. As indicated by\nthe orientation patterns of c-axes, prismatic surfaces are\ncommon, while boundaries oriented according to basal\nplanes do not occur parallel to the YZ section. In a gen-\neral way, boundaries whose poles are at low angle to the\nc-axes are rare (Fig. 3c, histogram).\n\nSEM MICROSTRUCTURES AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS\n\nSEM images (Fig. 4), in three perpendicular sections,\nXY, XZ and YZ, reveal the pore distribution and grain-\nboundary topography showing that fracture surfaces in\nthe iron formation rocks reveal a complex set of pores\nand grain boundary structures. Since almost 100% of\nthe fracture surfaces are intergranular grain surfaces,\nthe observed structures provide insights into the syn-\ndeformational interactions between pores (fluid) and\ngrain boundaries.\n\nQUARTZ-HEMATITE BOUNDARIES IN XY SECTIONS\n\nQuartz grain boundaries in contact with hematite plates\noriented normal to the maximum compression direction\n(i.e. XY sections) are typically flat and pore-free (Fig.\n4a). In principle the absence of pores and flat quartz\nboundaries in the XY sections cannot be used to dis-\ntinguish between a dry boundary and one containing a\nfluid. It is well know that it is possible to get fluid films\non grain boundaries in rocks undergoing deformation,\nbut once the deformation has stopped the fluid film\nbreaks up into isolated inclusions (Urai et al. 1986, Jin\net al. 1994, Daines and Kohlstedt 1997). However, the\nboundaries in the XY sections are perfectly flat and no\nisolated pores were observed on them. Two possibilities\nare envisioned to explain why these boundaries do not\nhave any porosity and their surfaces are perfectly flat.\n\nThe absence of pores and the flat nature of the\nboundaries might suggest the presence of a very thin\nfluid film (<2 nm, c.f. Raj 1982; wetting angle ? ? 0?,\ni.e. grain surface wetted by the fluid). Such thin aque-\nous fluids are likely to be highly structured and may ex-\nert a profound influence on the kinetics of intergranu-\nlar pressure solution. Therefore, the surfaces might be\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2011) 83 (3)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2011/7/6 \u2014 16:23 \u2014 page 880 \u2014 #6\n\n880 LEONARDO LAGOEIRO and CRISTIANE C.

GON\u00c7ALVES\n\nwetted with thin fluid when the rock was being actively\ndeformed, but the deformation had stopped and the thin\nfilm split up into isolated inclusions. The absence of\nporosity on the surfaces might be explained by post-\nkinematic textural adjustment due to static recrystalliza-\ntion accommodated by dry grain boundary or intragrain\ndiffusion. In this case the present grain boundary mi-\ncrostructures are not exactly those of the peak of meta-\nmorphism and deformation. However, the static recrys-\ntallization might be expected to occur in phase or grain\nboundaries with different orientations with respect to\nthe bulk strain ellipsoid, namely XZ and YZ planes,\nwhich are decorated with pores and inclusions of well-\nformed hematite or quartz grains, as described in the\nnext sections.\n\nAnother possibility is that the phase boundaries\n(XY orientation) were dry when grains were actively\ndeformed or at least in the late stage of deformation\nand the nature of the phase boundaries result from the\ncontact between flat hematite face (mostly basal planes)\nwith quartz grains. It is worth to note that the major-\nity of quartz grains show c-axes oriented preferentially\naround the Y -axis of the finite strain ellipsoid what im-\nply that basal (0001) faces of hematite grains (Fig. 3a)\nare in contact with prismatic {10-10} faces of quartz\ngrains. Besides, the theory of crystal growth shows that\nfaces that grow slowly will be dissolved slowly (Tullis\n1989). Then, would be more difficult to dissolve the\nquartz grains whose prismatic planes are perpendicu-\nlar to direction of maximum compression (Z direction).\nTherefore, the pores should be rare in the XY surfaces,\nnaturally, and the presence of hematite plates should in-\ncrease the difficulty to generate them.\n\nQUARTZ GRAIN BOUNDARIES PARALLEL TO THE\n\nXZ PLANES\n\nQuartz-quartz boundaries observed in XZ sections show\na distribution of regular faceted isolated pores. Depend-\ning on the face where the pores occur, triangular or pyra-\nmidal forms predominate (Fig. 4b and c). Grain bound-\nary topographies on faces parallel to XZ sections are\npredominantly flat. The pores commonly have regular\nshapes with faceted sides indicating crystallographically\ncontrolled shapes (Wegner and Christie 1983). Pyrami-\ndal (with flat bottom) and triangular (with curved sides\nand concave bottom) shapes are common (Fig. 4b and\n\nFig. 4c, respectively). They vary in size from 1 ?m to\n5 ?m and are relatively deep (3 ?m in depth for large\npores). The straight sides of the observed forms (Fig.\n4b), as well as the round forms, characterize the XZ\nquartz surfaces as basal planes, mainly (O\u2019Donoghue\n1987, Hippertt 1994), as indicated for the c-axes pre-\nferred orientation pattern (Fig. 3b). On the other hand,\nthe occurrence of triangular pores formed by straight\nand curved sides (Fig. 4c) is related to those grains ori-\nented at high angle to the foliation, once this pore geo-\nmetry characterize rhombohedral boundaries (O\u2019Dono-\nghue 1987, Hippertt 1994) parallel to XZ surfaces.\n\nThe regular form of the pores indicates, besides\nthe crystallographic control (Wegner and Christie 1983),\nthat a thermodynamic equilibrium between solid-fluid\nwas achieved along these boundaries. The presence of\nisolated pores indicates a non-wetting fluid distribution\n(Lee et al. 1991) or that the fluid phase on these quartz\ngrain boundaries did not exist as a continuous film.\nHowever, pores generally occur close to three- (indicated\nby arrows in Fig. 4b) and four-grain junctions (arrow\nhead in Fig. 4b). This kind of concentration of pores,\nin addition to the presence of openings along three-grain\njunctions and voids at four-grain junctions, indicates that\nthe aqueous fluid phase may also have resided along\nthe quartz three-grain junctions (grain edge channels). It\nmight have existed as a continuous interconnected fluid\nnetwork, with fluid at two-grain junctions confined to\nisolated pores.\n\nQUARTZ-QUARTZ INTERFACES FACING THE DIRECTION OF\n\nMAXIMUM EXTENTION (YZ SECTIONS)\n\nIn contrast, pores along boundaries facing the direction\nof maximum extension (approximately parallel to the\nYZ section) are abundant. These interfaces are charac-\nterized by highly irregular topographies where \u2018protru-\nsions\u2019 and \u2018depressions\u2019, as well as irregular pores pre-\ndominate (Fig. 4d, e and f). Pores on these boundaries\nare highly irregular in shape and 20 ?m across. Fea-\ntures that resemble protrusions are separated for large\nisolated depressions or pores and the height of the pro-\ntrusions above depressions varies and may reach up to\n4 ?m. Depressions observed on grain surfaces on one\nface of a fracture are not complemented by protrusions,\nwhich would fill these depressions on the other face of\nthe fracture.\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2011) 83 (3)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2011/7/6 \u2014 16:23 \u2014 page 883 \u2014 #9\n\nSEM OBSERVATION OF GRAIN BOUNDARY STRUCTURES 883\n\nSmall hematite and quartz grains occur inside some\n\nof the pores. They are predominantly faceted and have\n\nshape preferred orientation (SPO) with their longest axes\n\noriented in the direction of maximum extension ( X -axis)\n\n(Fig. 4f and g). Grain sizes inside the pores may vary\n\nfrom few ?m to 20 ?m. They are generally well formed\n\nwith distinct crystallographic forms (Fig. 4g). In some\n\nmicrographs hematite grains have been plucked off to-\n\ngether with quartz leaving their impression (negative\n\ncrystal) on the opposing quartz boundary (Fig. 4h).\n\nSome of these negative crystals exhibit perfect rhombic\n\nshapes of the hematite grains.\n\nThe quartz host grain boundaries with inclusions,\n\nirregular topography and pores are commonly present\n\nwhere quartz grains are in contact with larger hematite\n\nplates parallel to the bulk foliation (Fig. 4f). The ir-\n\nregular shape of the pores indicates that fluid at these\n\nboundaries was not in thermodynamic equilibrium with\n\nthe solid. Moreover, the presence of precipitated quartz\n\nand hematite grains inside the larger pores indicates that\n\naqueous fluid at these boundaries was saturated in Si\n\n(SiO2) and Fe (Fe2O3). These features imply that grain\n\nboundaries normal to the direction of maximum exten-\n\nsion are sites of preferential fluid concentration. In ad-\n\ndition, the irregular topography of these boundaries in-\n\ndicates that substantial grain growth may have occurred\n\nparallel to the direction of maximum extension (grain\n\nboundary migration).\n\nIt is well known that the crystallographic orienta-\n\ntion and the presence of water (and other aqueous\n\nfluids) have a significant effect on grain boundary mo-\n\nbility (Urai et al. 1986, Karato 1989). The new precip-\n\nitated grains grow with their c-axes aligned parallel to\n\nthe maximum extension direction, indicating that un-\n\nder conditions where fluid phase is in contact with the\n\ngrowing boundaries, grains oriented with basal planes\n\napproximately normal to the extension direction grow\n\nfaster (Tullis 1989, Hippertt 1994). Then, the growth is\n\nfaster in some crystallographic directions than others.\n\nHowever, when the host grains in the studied sam-\n\nples are considered some discrepancies occur and it\n\nis necessary to consider that the grain growth presum-\n\nably involves mass transport in the quartz-water system\n\nthrough a fluid phase or along grain surfaces (Tullis and\n\nYund 1982). Thus, the growth for the host grains oc-\n\ncur parallel to the maximum extension direction, but\n\ndifferently from the new precipitated grains, through\n\nthe migration of grain surfaces whose poles make high\n\nangles with the c-axes. The migrating quartz bound-\n\naries (large non-precipitated host grains) make, prefer-\n\nentially, angles higher than 50? with the c-axes and then\n\nthey should represent rhombohedral, trapezohedral and\n\nprismatic faces (Fig. 3c). Those boundaries that make\n\nless than 10? with the c-axes compound only 1.0% of\n\nthe boundaries whose orientation was measured and\n\nonly 8.5% of the data present angles smaller than 30?\n\n(Fig. 3c). Therefore, basal and sub-basal faces parallel\n\nto YZ surfaces are rare, for the host grains.\n\nThe higher solubility of quartz in the fluid bound-\n\nary (YZ surfaces) may promote grain boundary migration\n\nsince water dissolved in quartz lattice enhances solid-\n\nstate kinetics (dislocation motion and diffusion). The\n\ntiny entrapped hematite grains included in the YZ faces\n\nof quartz grains should exert a dragging effect on the\n\nmigrating quartz boundaries. The presence of hematite\n\ngrains inside the boundaries increases the interfacial\n\nfree energy of the grain, because they promote an in-\n\ncrease in the interfacial area as the grain boundary ad-\n\nvances and traps the hematite grains. However, the drag-\n\nging effect of hematite grains on growing grain bound-\n\nary may be overcome by the higher solubility of quartz\n\nfaces in contact with fluid, hence enhancing the grain\n\nboundary mobility, i.e., the rate which the material\n\n(atoms) can transfer through the grain boundary (accord-\n\ning to X direction).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe different pore topographies observed along bound-\n\naries with different orientations and the anisotropic dis-\n\ntribution of pores along these boundaries may suggest\n\nthat the fluid distribution and grain boundary structures\n\nin these rocks were highly anisotropic. Furthermore, on\n\nboundaries oriented at high angle to the X -axis, precipi-\n\ntated hematite grains suggest that these boundaries were\n\nsites of preferential precipitation (Fig. 5).\n\nA physical model (Fig. 5) to explain the anisotropic\n\nfluid distribution and grain growth is proposed. It takes\n\ninto account the microstructures observed in thin sec-\n\ntions, the distribution and characterization of pores, as\n\nwell as the grain boundary structures along the three\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2011) 83 (3)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2011/7/6 \u2014 16:23 \u2014 page 884 \u2014 #10\n\n884 LEONARDO LAGOEIRO and CRISTIANE C.

The presence of quartz host\n\ngrains having straight or smoothly curved grain bound-\n\naries, in addition to the presence of included small\n\nhematite grains close to the boundaries facing the di-\n\nrection of maximum extension, provides evidence for\n\ntwo possible mechanisms that can produce the observed\n\nmicrostructural features: anisotropic grain boundary mi-\n\ngration and recrystallization; and anisotropic crystal\n\ngrowth. Anisotropic grain boundary migration and re-\n\ncrystallization are relatively common processes and they\n\naccount for these common features in metamorphic tec-\n\ntonites (Blenkinsop 2000). However, although the re-\n\ncrystallization processes have important role in the for-\n\nmation of the anisotropic shape of grains in the tec-\n\ntonites studied (Castro 2007, Gon\u00e7alves and Lagoeiro\n\n2009b), our study is focused on the evidence of fluid-\n\ngrain interaction and its influence on the anisotropic\n\nsyn-kinematic and static crystal growth.\n\nThe grain boundary and pore geometries suggest a\n\nfluid-solid interaction in these rocks and also indicate\n\nthat static grain growth (involving grain boundary mi-\n\ngration in the presence of fluid at relatively high tem-\n\nperature) might have been an important process during\n\nthe evolution of microstructures in these rocks. The driv-\n\ning force for grain growth should be the reduction of\n\nthe total grain boundary area (grain boundary area re-\n\nduction \u2013 GBAR) (Vernon 1976, Poirier 1985), result-\n\ning in a reduction of the interfacial free energy for the\n\naggregate. The grain boundary migration that accom-\n\nplishes grain growth may be caused by the difference\n\nin free energy across the grain boundary curvature. The\n\nfree energy difference makes a boundary move toward\n\nits center of curvature, causing small grains to decrease\n\nin size (and then disappear) and large ones to increase.\n\nThe difference between the strain energy stored in adja-\n\ncent grains could be the driving force for grain bound-\n\nary migration, but as there are no optical features indi-\n\ncating differences in crystal plastic deformation between\n\nneighbor quartz grains, it should not play a major role\n\nin the process.\n\nStatic grain growth occurs when deformation de-\n\ncelerates or ceases, and the aggregate is not in a state of\n\nminimum free energy. Grains still contain dislocations\n\nand subgrains. At conditions with temperature relatively\n\nhigh and a large amount of fluid is present along grain\n\nboundaries, recovery, recrystallization and GBAR may\n\noccur until a configuration characterized by a state of\n\nminimum free energy can be reached. Under these con-\n\nditions characterized by a state of hydrostatic stress, fluid\n\ndistribution will be isotropic and so will favor the grain\n\ngrowth. The final aggregate will be comprised of grains\n\nof unimodal grain size. However, in the studied rocks\n\nthe quartz grains have a relatively high aspect ratio (up\n\nto 4:1 depending on the hematite content) and the pore\n\ndistribution along grain boundaries is highly anisotropic,\n\nwhich indicates that the grains have grown under non-\n\nhydrostatic stress conditions and constrained by platy\n\nhematite grains.\n\nThe anisotropy of interfacial energies and the non-\n\nhydrostatic stress on the aggregate produce significant\n\ndeviations from the fluid distribution predicted by iso-\n\ntropic equilibrium theory and then it may be accounted\n\nfor the anisotropic growth rates observed in the rocks\n\nstudied (Heidug 1991, Tullis et al. 1996). Walff and\n\nFaul (1992) have shown that the anisotropy of interfa-\n\ncial energies can produce connected fluid distributions\n\nat some grain junctions but isolated pores at others. It\n\nis worth noting that the way in which fluids are dis-\n\ntributed along grain boundaries depends on the nature\n\nof mineral interfaces. In this case, only phase bound-\n\naries (hematite-quartz) may yield a film fluid distribu-\n\ntion (Fig. 5a \u2013 no pores were observed along these\n\nboundaries and no triangular features of hematite are\n\nimpressed on quartz grain faces).\n\nHence, anisotropic grain growth is a result of het-\n\nerogeneous fluid distribution along grain boundaries,\n\nwhich is caused by the differential stress and the pres-\n\nence of hematite. Oriented hematite plates that together\n\nwith the slightly tabular quartz grains define the folia-\n\ntion have a profound effect on the nature of fluid dis-\n\ntribution in these rocks. Hematite plates might have a\n\nrole very similar to mica and other phyllosilicates in\n\nquartzite. It might maintain fluid along the interphase\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2011) 83 (3)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2011/7/6 \u2014 16:23 \u2014 page 886 \u2014 #12\n\n886 LEONARDO LAGOEIRO and CRISTIANE C. GON\u00c7ALVES\n\nboundaries (hematite/fluid/quartz) even under high nor-\n\nmal stress (Fig. 5a). Thus the presence of hematite en-\n\nhances the wetting behavior of fluid, promoting the dis-\n\nsolution and increasing grain boundary diffusion rates\n\nat these interphase boundaries. The presence of fluid\n\nalong the phase boundaries provides a faster diffusional\n\ntransport path between hematite and quartz grains than\n\nin other interfaces.\n\nThe grain scale transport of aqueous fluids in the\n\nrocks studied depend on the nature of the grain bound-\n\naries as well as on the orientation of the grain bound-\n\naries with respect to the principal axes of the finite strain\n\nellipsoid. Fluid-assisted diffusion on the phase bound-\n\naries (normal to the maximum compression direction)\n\nprovides the rapid transport of material. On quartz-\n\nquartz interfaces transport took place through an inter-\n\nconnected network of pores along three- and four-grain\n\njunctions. Quartz boundaries normal to the X -axis, pref-\n\nerentially rhombohedral and prismatic surfaces for the\n\nquartz crystals, are sites of fluid concentration and de-\n\nposition (Fig. 5b). Thus quartz boundaries migrate pref-\n\nerentially parallel to the direction of maximum elonga-\n\ntion. Therefore, mass transport is more effective parallel\n\nto the X -axis, resulting in faster grain growth in this di-\n\nrection corresponding to migration of boundaries whose\n\npoles make high angle with quartz c-axes. It is worth to\n\nnote that it is opposite to growth condition of new pre-\n\ncipitated quartz grains (Tullis 1989, Hippertt 1994).\n\nConsequently, the shape preferred orientation ob-\n\nserved in these rocks might not be exclusively attributed\n\nto recrystallization since anisotropic grain growth might\n\nhave had a significant contribution to the development of\n\naspect ratio of the grains. A similar result was achieved\n\nby Karato and Masuda (1989) in experimental deforma-\n\ntion of wetted quartz aggregates carried out under dif-\n\nferential stress. They found evidences for the formation\n\nof grain shape by anisotropic grain growth, as a result of\n\nanisotropic water distribution caused by a large differen-\n\ntial stress.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nMicrostructural observations of quartz-hematite tecton-\n\nites indicate that anisotropic fluid distribution and grain\n\ngrowth have exerted an important role on the fabric evo-\n\nlution of banded iron formation from Quadril\u00e1tero Fer-\n\nr\u00edfero (MG). Below are summarized the main conclu-\n\nsions of the present study.\n\n(1) In addition to the anisotropic grain boundary mi-\n\ngration and recrystallization, anisotropic dissolu-\n\ntion and grain growth were responsible for the for-\n\nmation of hematite plates and tabular quartz grains\n\ncontributing significantly to the generation of the\n\npenetrative foliation observed in these rocks.\n\n(2) Based on pore distribution, fluid distribution was\n\nhighly anisotropic. The anisotropy results from the\n\nnature of grain boundaries as well as the orienta-\n\ntion of the finite strain axes. Although we cannot\n\nconclude about the nature of fluid distribution on\n\npore-free flat surfaces oriented normal to the maxi-\n\nmum compression direction, we interpret that these\n\nphase boundaries were wetted with a continuous\n\nfluid film, which might be important in the disso-\n\nlution of both quartz and hematite grains, acting\n\nas faster diffusion pathway for transferring the dis-\n\nsolved material from the dissolution site to sites of\n\nprecipitation. At quartz-quartz boundaries normal\n\nto the intermediate strain axis, fluids occur as iso-\n\nlated pores typically faceted, reflecting crystallo-\n\ngraphic control, close to quartz-quartz edges, char-\n\nacterizing a fluid interconnected network along\n\nthree- and four-grain junctions on quartz-quartz\n\ninterfaces.\n\n(3) Quartz boundaries normal to the maximum elon-\n\ngation direction are sites of fluid concentration and\n\nprecipitation. On these boundaries small oriented\n\nfaceted hematite and quartz grains were precipi-\n\ntated in large irregular pores. Grain growth rates\n\nare faster parallel to the X -axis.\n\n(4) The presence of hematite plates may have a strong\n\neffect on wetting behavior of fluid in these rocks\n\nin a manner similar to that of micas in quartzites.\n\nHematite-quartz phase boundaries might have\n\nphysical and chemical properties very different\n\nfrom quartz-quartz interfaces. Even under high\n\nnormal stresses the phase boundaries might main-\n\ntain a continuous fluid film, increasing greatly the\n\ndiffusion rates along these boundaries. This condi-\n\ntion allows a faster quartz crystal growth parallel to\n\nrhombohedral, trapezohedral and prismatic bound-\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2011) 83 (3)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2011/7/6 \u2014 16:23 \u2014 page 887 \u2014 #13\n\nSEM OBSERVATION OF GRAIN BOUNDARY STRUCTURES 887\n\naries, differently from what is proposed for new\n\nprecipitated grains, which grow parallel to basal\n\nplanes.\n\n(5) In two distinct situations the presence of hema-\n\ntite influences the kinetics of quartz grain growth.\n\nFirst, small precipitated hematite grains may have\n\na pinning effect on quartz grain boundary migra-\n\ntion (boundaries facing the maximum elongation\n\ndirection). Second, the mean grain size of host\n\nquartz grains is substantially smaller in domains\n\nwith higher content of hematite.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors are grateful to the anonymous reviewers\n\nfor the helpful comments.
