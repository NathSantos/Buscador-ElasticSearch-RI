Considering the small size of the lacustrine ecosystem, we \nexpected that seasonal variations of the benthic community attributes are more important \nthan spatial variations; Methods: Two samplings, one in March and another in August, \nwere carried out at nine sites in the pond.

Other abiotic factors were measured, such as water transparency, \ndissolved oxygen, pH, electric conductivity, temperature, and depth of sediment sampling \nsites. Regarding the comparative analysis at spatial scale, no significant variations in \ndensity of the benthic invertebrate community were found. Results: In relation to the \nstudied abiotic factors, only depth presented significant differences among sampling \nsites; All the measured environmental parameters presented significant differences \namong sampling months, except depth and the physical and chemical characteristics \nof the sediment. The abundance of Chaoboridae and Chironomidae was the unique \nattribute with a significant difference in comparing the two months.

Relationships between the \ndifferent taxa of benthic macroinvertebrates and \nenvironmental factors were determined. Because \nit is a pond with small size, we expected seasonal \nvariations in benthic community to be more \nimportant than spatial ones, due to the structural \nhomogeneity of the environment. \n\n2. Material and Methods\n\nThe environment selected for the study (Mian \nPond, Figure\u00a01) is located near the mouth zone of \nthe Paranapanema into the Jurumirim Reservoir \n(S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil). It is a small pond (perimeter: \n1,592\u00a0 m; mean depth: 3.7\u00a0 m; length: 749\u00a0 m; \nmaximum width: 115\u00a0m). The Mian pond presents \npermanent connectivity to the river and one of the \nmargins is formed by a riparian forest while the \nother is a non-preserved area next to a soybean field, \nbeing partially protected from the wind. Nine sites \ndistributed in three transects were selected for the \nsamplings (Figure\u00a01).\n\nIn each site, three sediment samples were \ncollected in March and August 2009 with a \n0.064\u00a0m2  Van\u00a0Veen grab for the analysis of benthic \nfauna and an additional three samples for the \ndetermination of granulometric composition and \nquantification of organic matter in sediment. Depth \nprofiles of the lake bottom at sampling site transects \nare shown in Figure\u00a02.\n\nIn the field, sampled sediment for benthic fauna \nanalysis was washed in 250\u00a0\u00b5m mesh net and fixed \nwith 4% formaldehyde. Afterwards, the organisms \nwere sorted, identified, and counted under a \nstereoscopic microscope. They were identified up \n\n1. Introduction\n\nComparative studies of small water bodies \nhave been used to examine the relationships \nbetween environmental factors and the structure \nof aquatic communities (Heino, 2000). Benthic \nmacroinvertebrates present great importance in \nsome ecological processes, such as energy fluxes \nand nutrient cycling (Leal\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2003; Henry and \nSantos, 2008). Bioturbation of sediment surface and \nfragmentation of leaves from riparian vegetation are \nsome of the processes of nutrient release to water \ncarried out by benthic organisms (Caliman\u00a0et\u00a0al., \n2007; Callisto\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2009).\n\nConsidering the benthic macroinvertebrates, \ninsects are the predominant taxonomic group \nin abundance and biomass in the majority of \ntropical lakes (Fran\u00e7a and Callisto, 2007). In all \nthese environments, a predominance of Diptera, \nChironomidae (Stenert\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2004; Roque\u00a0et\u00a0al., \n2004), and Chaoboridae (Fukuhara\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 1987) \nhas been recorded.\n\nAccording to Jonasson (1996), the distribution, \ncomposition, and diversity of macroinvertebrates, \nas well as of other aquatic communities, are affected \nby abiotic and biotic factors and also by mutual \ninteractions among the organisms. Thus, benthic \nmacroinvertebrate communities clearly indicate \nthe ecological conditions of inhabited aquatic \necosystems. According to Kownacki\u00a0et\u00a0al. (2000), \nbenthic fauna composition in aquatic environments \ndepends mainly on factors such as substratum type, \nwater trophic status, and hydro-period.\n\nOxygen and depth also constitute essential \nfactors to macroinvertebrate distribution (Santos \nand Henry, 2001). Density of these organisms is \nremarkably lower at great depths, but the existence of \nsome species tolerant to low oxygen concentrations \nis evidenced at these sites (Hirabayashi and Hayashi, \n1994). Other important factors for benthic species \ndistribution are the availability of food resources \n(Sanseverino\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 1998) and the interspecific \ntrophic interactions, such as competition and \npredation (Walker, 1998).\n\nHa b i t a t  c o m p l e x i t y  c a n  d e t e r m i n e  t h e \ncomposition of a local community. According to \nBarreto (1999), diversity of biological communities \nin more complex sites tends to increase due to \nthe presence of environments with minor stress, \nample availability of shelter against predators, and \nprotection against physical disturbances, which \nserve to assist in survival, recovery, and persistence \nof the organisms. Therefore communities in \nhabitats with low complexity usually present great \n\n\n\n156 Shimabukuro, EM. and Henry, R.

All of them, except \nthe transparency, were measured at the surface and \n10\u00a0 cm of the bottom. Sediment granulometric \ncomposition was determined according to the \nWentworth scale (Suguio, 1973) and organic matter \ncontent, through calcination loss (in a furnace at \n550\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0hour).\n\nAfter observation of parametric distribution, \ndescriptive statistics (mean) were computed for \n\nto the lowest taxonomic level using specialized \nliterature (Trivinho-Strixino and Strixino 1995; \nMerrit and Cummins, 1996; Brinkhurst and \nMarchese, 1992; Mugnai\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 2010). Density \n(individuals.m-2) and relative abundance of benthic \nmacroinvertebrates were computed.\n\nThe following water physical and chemical \nvariables were determined: temperature (by mercury \nthermometer), transparency (by Secchi disk), \ndissolved oxygen (through the Winkler method, \nmodified by azyde addition, Golterman and Clymo, \n\nFigure 1.

Results\n\nA small variation in rainfall (<3\u00a0 mm) was \nobserved, between the two sampling months \n(Figure\u00a0 3). Considering that in July there was a \nhigh level of rainfall, atypical for the dry season, \nno significant difference in depth was found in \ncomparing the two studied periods (Figure\u00a04). \n\nIn almost all the sites, silt/clay was dominant in \nthe sediment, followed by very fine and fine sands \n\nthe measured environmental variables and for the \nbenthic groups (Chaoboridae, Chironomidae, \nNematoda and Oligochaeta) that presented great \ntotal abundance of organisms (>4%). Next, data \nwere log (x\u00a0+\u00a01) transformed and submitted to a two \nway variance analysis (ANOVA) involving sampling \nsites (n\u00a0 =\u00a0 9) and periods (n\u00a0 =\u00a0 2). Normality and \nvariance homogeneity were obtained. A 0.1 level \nwas used for testing the significance of ANOVA.\n\nPearson correlations were computed to assess \nsignificant relationships (p\u00a0 >\u00a0 0.03) between \nabundance of benthic taxa and environmental \ndata (water temperature, depth, transparency, \npH, dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity, \n\nFigure 3.

The maximum \ndensity (344 individuals.m\u20132) was observed at site \n4 in March. Oligochaeta predominated in three \nsites (site 2 in March and sites 8 and 9 in August). \nThe highest densities were recorded in August \n(maximum of 240 individuals.m\u20132) and rose to \naround 21% of all the organisms in the entire study. \nNematoda occurred in almost all the sampled sites \nand presented the highest relative abundance (50% \nof the total density of organisms) at site 9 in March. \nThe highest density (286 individuals.m\u20132) occurred \nat site 2 in August. Considering both months, \nNematoda density corresponded to approximately \n17% of the organisms.\n\nChironomidae was a group with low abundance \n(?2%) in the first month of the study and appeared \nonly in two sampling sites. However, in August, \nChironomidae specimens were observed in almost \nall the sites (except in site 9) and the highest density \n(260 individuals.m\u20132) was recorded in site 3.\n\nOnly depth presented a significant difference \namong sampling sites (F\u00a0 =\u00a0 3.30; p\u00a0 =\u00a0 0.04). \nComparing the two periods of the year, ANOVA \ns h owe d  a  s i g n i f i c a n t  d i f f e re n c e  f o r  w a t e r \ntemperature (highest value in March), water \nelectrical conductivity at surface and bottom \n(highest values in August), water pH at surface \nand bottom (highest values in August), dissolved \noxygen in water at bottom (highest concentration \nin August), and water transparency (highest value \nin March) (Figure\u00a08). Regarding the abundance of \nbenthic macroinvertebrates, significant differences \nwere recorded for Chaoboridae (highest value \nin March) and Chironomidae (highest value in \nAugust).\n\nSignificant Pearson correlations between \nbiological and environmental variables are presented \nin Table\u00a0 1.

Higher values of silt/clay were observed \nin March. In site 4, sediment was composed of \ndifferent fractions at the same levels as in March \nand August (Figure\u00a0 5). In site 9, it was observed \nthe greatest change in sediment composition \nfrom March to August.

Nevertheless, it was not likely to \ncause significant differences in ecological attributes \nof the community in these local. These observations \nevidenced great influence of seasonality on \norganization of the macroinvertebrate community.\n\nIn relation to benthic macroinvertebrates \nrecorded in lakes of the same study region (Davanso \nand Henry, 2006, 2007), Mian Pond was the only \nthat didn\u2019t show significance difference in spatial \ndistribution of the fauna. This finding can be \nexplained by the reduced size, simple shape (no \ndendritic), and its relatively homogeneous sediment \ncomposition, morphological characteristics which \noffer low habitat complexity for the colonization \nand permanence of new species. Therefore, the \nsimple structure of the pond must be considered \nan important factor in the homogeneity of spatial \ncomposition registered in the water body, resulting \nin few local alterations in abiotic factors and, \nconsequently, in benthic community. \n\ncoarse, and mean sand).

Discussion\n\nIn this study, low rainfall variation was observed \nin the two sampling months, selected to be \nrepresentative of the rainy and dry seasons. This \nobservation can characterize an \u201catypical\u201d year, \nconsidering that the precipitation in August was \ndifferent from the previous occurrence in the region \n(Martins and Henry, 2004; Henry, 2003, 2005; \nDavanso and Henry, 2006, 2007). This certainly \naffected the environmental variables of the aquatic \necosystem, except water temperature. \n\nDespite effects of precipitation regime on \nbenthic fauna were slightly detectable, significant \nseasonal alterations in community structure were \nobserved, mainly due to variation in temperature, \ndissolved oxygen and sediment composition \nbetween the seasons.

According to Corbi and Trivinho-\nStrixino, (2002), and Beckett\u00a0 et\u00a0 al. (1992), the \nhighest densities of benthic macroinvertebrates \nare recorded in environments rich in macrophytes. \n\n\n\n2011, vol. 23, no. 2,  p. 154-163 Controlling factors of benthic macroinvertebrates\u2026 161\n\nmaintenance of Chaoboridae and Chironomidae \nduring the entire year. However, in our study, \nChironomidae showed a significant negative \ncorrelation with water temperature, similarly to \nthat observed by Davanso and Henry (2006) in \na pond near the Mian Pond. On the other hand, \na significant association between Chaoboridae \norganisms and high temperature was recorded \nin the present study, a condition also verified by \nCleto-Filho and Arcifa (2006) who found highest \ndensities of Chaoborus in hot periods, in the Monte \nAlegre Lake.\n\nAccording to Roque\u00a0 et\u00a0 al. (2004) and \nBrito\u00a0 Junior\u00a0 et\u00a0 al. (2005), Chironomidae larvae \nare the most representative and abundant group \nof the benthic macroinvertebrates due to their \nhigh capacity to adapt to different environmental \nconditions which many other groups cannot. \nTherefore, anoxic conditions in March may have \ncaused the absence of these organisms, since \nChironomidae densities present significant positive \ncorrelation with bottom oxygen concentrations. \nWith the increase in oxygen concentration in \nAugust, these aquatic insects were recorded.\n\nLow pH values in March, significantly different \nfrom those observed in August, were probably \nrelated to the intense degradation of organic matter, \nsince low water acidity is derived from ions released \nduring decomposition. This fact seems to cause \nsome disadvantaged to some taxa in the month of \nMarch, such as Chironomidae, that showed positive \ncorrelation with water pH. \n\nTransparency was a secondary factor responsible \nfor seasonal variation in density of these two benthic \ngroups as it depends on the rain intensity. The \nrainfall peak in July, one month before sampling, \nwas the factor responsible for re-suspension of fine \nmaterial from the bottom to the water column \nthrough the continuous mixing of water. Thus, \nsignificantly higher water transparency in March, \nwhen compared to August, seems to have negatively \naffected the fauna. Again, Chironomidae was most \naffected, which was negatively correlated to the \nvariable. Leech and Johnsen (2009) concluded \nthat changes in transparency of freshwaters may \ncause alteration in species depth distribution and \naffect predator-prey behavior, then, increases in \ntransparency may benefits visual predators. Possibly \nin this study, high transparency facilitates the \nvisualization of Chironomidae by predators, such \nas fishes. \n\nRegarding the granulometric composition of \npond sediment, silt/clay was dominant in almost \n\nMacrophytes can increase the structural complexity \nof the environment, as the patches produces high \namount of organic matter in sediment that lies just \nbelow them and in their surrounding area. Through \nthis, some spatial differences may be produced in \nbenthic composition since the patches are unequally \ndistributed along the ponds.\n\nLow values of dissolved oxygen in the pond \nbottom were found in both sampling months, \nespecially in March (in all the sampling sites \n<3\u00a0 mg.L\u20131). According to Hepp (2002), values \n<4\u00a0 mg.L\u20131 are enough to cause the mortality \nof many invertebrates not adapted to hypoxic \nconditions near sediment. The variation in pond \ndepth appears not to directly influence the observed \nalterations in oxygen concentration, since the Mian \nPond is a shallow environment. Differences in \noxygen among sites were insignificant and appear \nto be unimportant for spatial distribution of the \norganisms. Oxygen concentrations at the bottom \nwere lower in the first month sampled. This fact can \nbe explained by the high amount of allochthonous \nmatter introduced in the pond due to the high level \nof water flux and discharge of the Paranapanema \nRiver in January and February 2009. Organic \nmatter deposition at the pond bottom increased \nbiological processes, especially decomposition, \nproducing high oxygen consumption. Then oxygen \nwas probably the determining factor for the lower \nvalues of benthic fauna density in March (except \nfor Choboridae). \n\nChaoboridae, Oligochaeta, Nematoda and \nChironomidae were predominant in benthic fauna. \nAccording to Pamplin\u00a0et\u00a0al. (2006) and Higuti and \nTakeda (2002), the Diptera order, including the \nChaoboridae and Chironomidae families, and the \nOligochaeta class, represent the most noticeable and \nrelevant organisms of macroinvertebrate benthic \nassemblies.\n\nConsidering the two sampling periods, there \nwere significant alterations in the densities of \nboth groups, with the Chaoboridae being the \nmost significant in total abundance in March and \nChironomidae in August. These modifications in \ndensities can be due to significant environmental \nvariations among the months of the study, especially \nin the water temperature. This observation is \nevidence of the powerful influence of seasonality \non the distribution of these organisms.\n\nStrixino and Trivinho-Strixino (1980) observed \nthat aquatic ecosystems presenting low mean depths \n(approximately 3\u00a0 m) are able to maintain a high \nwater temperature, thus enabling a proliferation and \n\n\n\n162 Shimabukuro, EM. and Henry, R.

Hydrobiologia, \n\nall the sampled sites, followed by very fine and fine \nsand fractions. This characteristic is another factor \nthat enhanced the great Chaoboridae development \nin Mian Pond, especially in March when fine \nfractions was higher, as densities presented positive \ncorrelations with silt and negative correlations with \ncoarse sand fractions.\n\nConsidering the associations between benthic \nmacroinvertebrate distribution in the aquatic \nenvironment and abiotic factors described \npreviously, we concluded that reduced spatial \nvariation of benthos occurred in the Mian Pond. \nDespite the fact that in 2009, no evident hydrologic \nvariations were observed between rainy and dry \nseasons due to \u201catypical\u201d rainfall in July, the \nseasonality effects on benthic fauna were more \nexpressive than spatial ones, mainly because of \nthis community response to some environmental \nfactors, like water temperature, dissolved oxygen at \ndeep zones, and characteristics of bottom sediment. \nEven though there was a wide variation in depth \namong the sampled sites, it was not able to change \nthe structure of benthic community, reinforcing \nthe idea that in environments with low structural \ncomplexity, physical and chemical factors of water \nand sediment are more homogeneous, having \nsmaller effect on fauna.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank Hamilton Rodrigues for \nhelping in the field work, as well as to Dr. Gilmar \nPerbiche Neves for the support with statistical \nanalysis.
