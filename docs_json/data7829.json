Os avan\u00e7os recentes em ET t\u00eam beneficiado da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de matrizes \ntridimensionais porosas (scaffolds) que permitem a ades\u00e3o, prolifera\u00e7\u00e3o e regenera\u00e7\u00e3o das c\u00e9lulas bem \ncomo a vasculariza\u00e7\u00e3o, estimulando a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de novo tecido. A obten\u00e7\u00e3o de scaffolds de quitosano \n(CH) para a regenera\u00e7\u00e3o \u00f3ssea tem merecido especial interesse devido \u00e0s suas propriedades biol\u00f3gicas \ne f\u00edsicas, apresentando no entanto o inconveniente da falta de resist\u00eancia mec\u00e2nica e de bioatividade. A \nobten\u00e7\u00e3o de scaffolds comp\u00f3sitos por incorpora\u00e7\u00e3o na matriz polim\u00e9rica de materiais bioactivos de \nfosfato de c\u00e1lcio, permite refor\u00e7ar o scaffold, melhorando o seu desempenho mec\u00e2nico e a sua \nosteocondutividade.  \nNo presente trabalho, produziram-se scaffolds comp\u00f3sitos de quitosano/hidroxiapatite por processos de \ncongelamento e liofiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de suspens\u00f5es de fosfatos de c\u00e1lcio (CaP) em solu\u00e7\u00f5es de CH. Utilizaram-\nse CaP sintetizados laboratorialmente, quer na forma de fibras de hidroxiapatite (HA), quer de lamelas \nde monetite, quer de mistura dos dois. Os CaP foram sintetizados por um m\u00e9todo de precipita\u00e7\u00e3o em \nmeio aquoso, tendo-se monitorizado a precipita\u00e7\u00e3o de fosfato de c\u00e1lcio durante 3 dias. Avaliou-se a \nevolu\u00e7\u00e3o das fases cristalinas e da morfologia das part\u00edculas precipitadas por microscopia eletr\u00f3nica de \nvarrimento (SEM), difrac\u00e7\u00e3o de raios X (XRD) e por adsor\u00e7\u00e3o de N2 usando a isot\u00e9rmica de BET. Os \nresultados evidenciaram que o aumento da temperatura de refluxo acelera a transforma\u00e7\u00e3o das fibras \nde octacalcium fosfato em fibras de H\u00c1, permitindo reduzir o tempo de precipita\u00e7\u00e3o total para \nobten\u00e7\u00e3o de fibras de HA \n As solu\u00e7\u00f5es de quitosano e as suspens\u00f5es de HAP em solu\u00e7\u00e3o de CH, a dois valores de pH (pH=2 e \npH= 5), foram congeladas a tr\u00eas temperaturas diferentes antes de serem liofilizadas. Caracterizaram-se \nos scaffolds por SEM, DRX, microtomografia computorizada (\u00b5 -CT) e espectroscopia de \ninfravermelhos com transformada de Fourier (FTIR), tendo-se ainda avaliado o seu comportamento \nmec\u00e2nico em compress\u00e3o. Obtiveram-se scaffolds comp\u00f3sitos macroporosos com porosidade superior \na 80%, tamanho de poro na gama 50-250\u00b5m e porosidade interconectada com grau de interconex\u00e3o de \n91-98.5%. Verificou-se que o tamanho e morfologia de poro dos scaffolds \u00e9 condicionado pelo pH das \nsuspens\u00f5es e pela temperatura de congelamento. O valor de pH mais elevado (pH=5) e a temperatura \nde congelamento mais elevada (T=0\u00baC) s\u00e3o as condi\u00e7\u00f5es que mais favorecem o crescimento de cristais \nde gelo e por conseguinte a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de poros de maior dimens\u00e3o. Verificou-se tamb\u00e9m que a \nincorpora\u00e7\u00e3o de part\u00edculas de CaP na matriz polim\u00e9rica de CH aumenta a resist\u00eancia mec\u00e2nica do \nscaffold, que \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m condicionada pelo tamanho de poro e pela morfologia da part\u00edcula de CaP. O \nestudo do comportamento bioactivo dos scaffolds comp\u00f3sitos em solu\u00e7\u00f5es simuladoras do plasma \nhumano (SBF), monitorizando a varia\u00e7\u00e3o das concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de Ca e P na solu\u00e7\u00e3o de SBF, evidenciou \no contributo das part\u00edculas de CaP para a bioactividade do scaffold. Os scaffolds comp\u00f3sitos em que \ncoexistem brushite e HA (preparados a pH=2) evidenciaram bioactividade superior \u00e1 dos scaffolds \ncomp\u00f3sitos CH/HA. \nPreparam-se tamb\u00e9m scaffolds incorporando gr\u00e2nulos de hidroxiapatite carregados com um f\u00e1rmaco \nmodelo, a dexametasona (DEX), na solu\u00e7\u00e3o inicial de CH. Os gr\u00e2nulos obtiveram-se por atomiza\u00e7\u00e3o \nde suspens\u00f5es de HA nanom\u00e9trica em solu\u00e7\u00e3o de DEX. Constru\u00edram-se os perfis de liberta\u00e7\u00e3o da DEX \nem solu\u00e7\u00e3o tamp\u00e3o fosfato (PBS) por determina\u00e7\u00e3o da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de DEX por espectroscopia de \nultravioleta (UV) ao comprimento de onda de 242 nm. Entre as v\u00e1rias curvas de liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de DEX \ndecorrentes das diferentes metodologias testadas para carregamento do f\u00e1rmaco, evidenciou-se um \nperfil de liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de DEX segundo o qual cerca de 80% da DEX \u00e9 libertado ao longo de ~30 dias, \nassegurando-se assim uma liberta\u00e7\u00e3o mais lenta e prolongada do que as referidas na literatura para a \nDEX  \nAs caracter\u00edsticas dos scaffolds comp\u00f3sitos preparados no presente trabalho apontam os materiais \nproduzidos como promissores para aplica\u00e7\u00e3o em engenharia de tecidos, apresentando como potencial \nadicional a capacidade de se comportarem como sistemas de liberta\u00e7\u00e3o controlada de f\u00e1rmacos. \n\n\n\nvi \n\n \n\nkeywords \n \n\nChitosan, Calcium Phosphate, Hydroxyapatite, Composite, Scaffolds, Pore Structure, Bioactivity, \nMechanical Properties, Drug Delivery, Bone Regeneration, Tissue Engineering \n\nabstract \n \n\nTissue engineering research attempts to satisfy the needs of support, reinforcement and in some \ncases organization of the regenerating tissue with a controlled supply of bioactive substances that \nmight positively influence the behaviour of incorporated or ingrowing cells. As demonstrated by the \nrecent advances on biomaterials, the ideal scaffold for tissue regeneration should offer a 3D \ninterconnected porous structure behaving as a template to promote cells adhesion and proliferation \nand vascularisation as well thus stimulating the new tissue ingrowth. A special interest has been \nfocused on chitosan (CH - the partially deacetylated derivative of chitin) scaffolds for bone \nregeneration due to its biological and physical properties, in spite of some drawbacks regarding its \nlack of mechanical strength and bioactivity. The incorporation of bioactive calcium phosphates \nmaterials in the polymer matrix is expected to reinforce chitosan scaffolds improving their \nmechanical performance and osteoconductivity. \nIn the present work, chitosan based scaffolds were produced by freeze-drying CH solutions \ncontaining calcium phosphate (CaP) particles, either as fibers of hydroxyapatite (HA), platelets of \nmonetite or a mixture of both. CaP particles were prepared by a wet precipitation method. The \ncalcium phosphate precipitation was monitored by taking a number of samples during 3-days. \nEvolution of the morphology and crystal phase composition of the precipitated particles were \nfollowed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), N2 adsorption using the BET isotherm (BET), and \nX-ray diffraction (XRD). It was observed that the increase of refluxing temperature allowed a faster \ntransformation of octacalcium phosphate fibers into HA fibers, hence shortening the precipitation \ntime required for obtaining HA fibers, \nChitosan based scaffolds suspensions at two different pH values were frozen at three different \ntemperatures before freeze-drying (thermally induced phase separation-TIPS). SEM, XRD, \nmicrocomputed tomography (\u00b5 -CT) and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used \nto analyze the physical and chemical properties of the composite scaffolds. Compressive mechanical \ntests were also undertaken to characterize the materials. Bioactivity studies were performed in \nsimulated body fluid (SBF) solutions by monitoring the Ca and P concentration variations of SBF \nsolutions.  \nHighly interconnected macroporous scaffolds with a pore size ranging from of 50 to 250\u00b5 m, \ninterconnectivity around 91-98.5%, and porosity higher than 80% were obtained. The freezing \ntemperature and the pH of chitosan solution/suspension revealed to play a significant influence in the \npore structure. The higher pH (pH=5) and the higher freezing temperature (T=0\u00baC) were found as the \nmost favourable conditions for ice crystal growth which resulted in larger pores. It was also observed \nthat CaP particles incorporation in the CH matrix increased the scaffold mechanical strength which \nwas also conditioned by the pore size and by the reinforcing particle morphology. The bioactivity \nstudies revealed the CaP contribution for the scaffold bioactivity. The composite scaffolds having \nbrushite and HA (obtained at pH=2) exhibited enhanced bioactivity as compared to composite \nCH/HA scaffolds based.  \nCH based scaffolds were also prepared by incorporating HA granules loaded with dexamethasone \n(DEX), a drug model, in CH solution. The granules were obtained by spray drying HA nanosized \nparticles suspended in DEX solution. The drug release profiles of DEX were determined in \nphosphate-buffered solution (PBS) by DEX concentration evaluation in the releasing medium by \nUltraviolet (UV) spectroscopy at the wavelength of 242 nm. Among the different DEX release \npatterns corresponding to the various DEX loading methodologies which were tested, an adequate \nrelease profile could be selected: it showed that the release of 80% of the DEX loaded amount could \nbe ensured during ~30 days, thus enabling a prolonged and slowest DEX release as compared to \nliterature reports. It is thus found that the CH scaffolds engineered with a calcium phosphate based \ndrug delivery system (DDS) provides the desirable association of a bioactive and osteoconductive \nmatrix with an in situ controlled release of a therapeutic agent. These results point out an additional \npotential of the composite CH/HA scaffolds for behaving as a controlled drug release system (DDS).   \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nvii \n\n \n\nLIST OF CONTENTS \n \nLIST OF CONTENTS ........................................................................................................ vii \nLIST OF FIGURES ............................................................................................................. ix \nLIST OF TABLES .............................................................................................................. xii \nABBREVIATION ............................................................................................................. xiii \nGLOSSARY ...................................................................................................................... xiv \nChapter 1 Introduction and Objectives .................................................................................. 1 \nChapter 2 Literature Review ................................................................................................. 5 \n\n2.1.

Objectives \n\n \n\nTissue engineering (TE) is an important therapeutic strategy aiming at replacing \n\nand facilitating the re-growth of injured or diseased tissue1. The application of tissue \n\nengineering comprises in a wide range area, such as fabricated skin, liver, pancreas, \n\ncartilage, bone, ligament, tendon, etc2. Its basic concept started believing that cells can be \n\nisolated from a patient, expanded in a culture, seeded into a carrier, and finally grafted \n\nback into the patient. The goal of tissue engineering which is to fabricate living \n\nreplacement parts for the body is achieved by combining three main elements: biomaterials \n\n(scaffold), cells, and bioactive/signaling molecules3.   \n\nOne of tissue engineering applications is bone regeneration. Bone loss due to \n\ntrauma or disease is one vital health problem. In United States at least 6,3 million fractures \n\nhappen every year, bone problem due to osteoporosis harm over 10 million Americans, \n\nand disease due to low bone mass affect another 34 millions3. In all those cases and also \n\nother cases, such as bone cancers, bone regeneration is critical in order to restore the \n\nfunction. \n\nSeveral medical treatments are available for bone injuries, being autograft one of \n\nthem. In the case of autograft, implantation is done by harvesting bone tissue from one \n\ncertain site in patient\u2019s body and fixing it to the injured site. However, several limitations \n\nwere found in these treatments, such as loosing function in the place where the bone was \n\nharvested, infection, and pain. Besides autograft, allograft and xenograft can also be done \n\nfor bone implantation where the bone grafts are obtained from another person and another \n\nspecies, respectively. In this case, spreading of danger diseases and negative response from \n\nthe body might occur3. Bone implantation can also be done by using metallic materials, \n\nsuch as iron, cobalt, titanium. Nevertheless, some drawbacks mainly related to the \n\ninappropriate mechanical properties appear. Ceramic materials are also able to be utilized \n\nfor surgical implantations. However, besides their inadequate mechanical performance, \n\nseveral shortcomings from both ceramics and metals are their low or non-biodegradability \n\nand limited processing.  \n\nThe development in TE area might be one of the solutions of the previous \n\nproblems. By utilizing scaffolds, cells, and or bioactive molecules to support and facilitate \n\nthe growth of new bone tissue, a bone defect will be restored without the use of any \n\npermanent implant3. TE approach in general, including for bone regeneration, can be done \n\nin several ways as shown in Figure 1-1. Based on the existence of cells prior to \n\nimplantation, systems can be divided into two: cellular systems and acellular systems4. In \n\nacellular systems, scaffolds are implanted directly in the human body without cell addition. \n\nWhile in cellular system, two approaches can be done: (1) seeding cell at point of delivery \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Introduction \n\n \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\nand (2) seeding and allowing cells to remodel the scaffold into natural tissue in the \n\nlaboratory prior to implantation5. \n\n \nFigure 1-1 Application of scaffolds in tissue engineering (TE) approach consisting of (1) in vivo \n\napproaches with or without cells and (2) traditional TE which involves seeding and growing cells in the \nlaboratory 5 \n\n \nBased on explanation above, it is clear that the scaffold has an important role in TE \n\napproach. In order to fulfill its purpose, the scaffold has to meet several requirements, such \n\nas: biocompatibility, bioactivity, biodegradability, and appropriate mechanical properties. \n\nSeveral materials, including ceramics, polymer, and ceramics-polymer composite have \n\nbeen used for preparing scaffolds. The advantages of using ceramics, such as CaP \n\n(Hydroxyapatite/HA, ?-Tricalcium phosphate/?-TCP) and bioglass, are their \n\nbiocompatibility, osteoconductivity and sufficient mechanical strength. HA is one \n\ncompound which is most used since its chemical composition is similar with inorganic \n\ncomponent of bone in human body. In the other hand, they also have several shortcomings, \n\nsuch as being slowly degradable and brittle6. Utilizing polymers have some limitations, \n\nmainly poor stiffness and compression strength. As compared to ceramics, some polymers, \n\nsuch as polylactid acid (PLA, PLLA, PDLA), polyglycolic acid (PGA), collagen, alginate, \n\nand chitosan, may easily degrade. The adequate combination of ceramics and polymers is \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Introduction \n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nthus being addressed as a promising approach for producing scaffolds displaying the \n\ndesired characteristic for bone TE. \n\n Another function of the scaffold in bone regeneration besides its supporting \n\nstructure role for cells grow is as drug delivery system (DDS). During its function as cell \n\ngrowth support, ideal scaffolds are supposed to degrade6, 26, 7. Based on this nature, drugs \n\ncan be loaded into the scaffold and later released to implantation sites during scaffold \n\ndegradation.  \n\nAmong the most studied composite scaffold, it is worthy to mention chitosan/CaP \n\n(CH/CaP) composite materials due to chitosan biocompatibility and biodegradability and \n\nto bioactivity of CaP (as HA and TCP). A number of studies on the area of CH/CaP has \n\nbeen carried out8, 9, 10, 11, 7, 43 showing that the addition of CaP has improved the \n\nmechanical properties of CH/?-TCP scaffold9, the biocompatibility and bioactivity of \n\nCH/nano-HA scaffold8, 43 . Furthermore it was also shown that CH scaffold may play a \n\nretarding role during a drug release, i.e. gentamincin sulphate, which is kept under release \n\nfor more than 3 weeks7, thus pointing its potential for DDS applications. However the \n\ncombination of scaffold and DDS performance in the same biomaterial device has been \n\nscarcely exploited.  Furthermore CH based scaffolds still present relatively modest pore \n\nsizes, very often less than 100\u00b5 m8, 43. Studies aiming to improve CH scaffolds \n\nmicrostructure are thus still welcome.  \n\nIn the framework of the CH issues stated above, it is necessary to further exploit \n\nboth the composition and the manufacturing method of CH/HA composite scaffold in \n\norder to improve its structural characteristics (including pore size, porosity, \n\ninterconnectivity) and potentialities as a DDS. The present study is thus targeted to the \n\ndevelopment of CH/HA composite scaffolds aimed at bone regeneration, with the \n\nfollowing objectives: \n\n1. To exploit and understand the role of processing variables including the pH of chitosan \nsolution, and the freezing temperature on chitosan based scaffolds microstructure. \n\n2. To combine the effects of processing variables  and of  different types of CaP \n\nreinforcing particles for engineering the scaffold microstructure and bioactivity while  \n\nimproving the mechanical properties of the scaffold \n\n3. To evaluate the potentiality of CH scaffolds as drug delivery system. \n\nFor achieving these objectives, composite scaffolds with different compositions \n\nwere produced under different experimental freeze drying conditions. The microstructure, \n\nmechanical properties, and bioactivity of the obtained scaffolds are here analyzed and \n\ndiscussed. Furthermore, the scaffolds behavior as drug delivery systems using \n\ndexamethasone as a drug model is also analyzed.   \n\nThis report consists of five chapters. Chapter 1 addresses the interest and objectives \n\nof the present study. In Chapter 2, literature review about scaffolds, including its \n\nrequirements, raw materials and manufacturing techniques are set up to build up better \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Introduction \n\n \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nunderstanding on this area. The problem formulation of this research is presented in \n\nChapter 3. Materials and methods of the experimental procedure are explained in Chapter \n\n4. The results and respective discussions are presented in Chapter 5. Finally the main \n\nconclusions and recommendations are summarized in Chapters 6. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Literature Review \n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nChapter 2  \nLiterature Review \n\n \nIn the following section, basic knowledge and information regarding to the topic \n\nfrom recent publications and books are presented in order to have better understanding. In \n\nsection 2.1 a number of issues related to porous scaffold requirements for bone \n\nregeneration are explained. Section 2.2 describes the material choices for scaffold; \n\ninformation about chitosan and CaP are written here. And in section 2.3, a number of \n\nscaffold manufacturing processes are illustrated. \n\n \n\n2.1. Porous Scaffold for Bone Regeneration \nIn tissue engineering, scaffold has an important role. Scaffold is designed as three-\n\ndimensional biodegradable structure which possesses a high porosity and pore \n\ninterconnectivity. It performs as structural support for cells while they gradually degrade \n\nand the new tissue being formed6.  \n\nAs mentioned in chapter 1 about scaffold requirements, the criteria for choosing \n\nmaterials to perform as scaffold are quite complicated and challenging since it has to face \n\ncomplex biological and sensitive system as the human body. In the case of bone \n\nregeneration application, several requirements should be fulfilled as shown in Table 2-1. \n\n \nTable 2-1 Scaffold Basic Design Parameters for Bone Tissue Engineering12 \n\nParameter Requirements \nPorosity  Maximum possible without compromising mechanical properties (typical \n\nporosity around 90%) \nPore size 200-400\u00b5 m \nPore structure  Interconnected \nMechanical properties of cancellous bone  \nTension and compression Strength : 5-10 MPa \n Modulus : 50-100 MPa \nMechanical properties of cotical bone  \nTension Strength : 80-150 MPa \n Modulus 17-20 GPa \nCompression Strength : 130-220 MPa \n Modulus : 17-20 GPa \n Fracture Toughness : 6-8MPa ?m \nDegradation Properties  \nDegradation time Must be tailored to match the application in patients \nDegradation mechanism Bulk dissolution in medium \nBiocompatibility No chronic inflammation \nSterizability Strerizable without altering material properties \nBioactivity Bioactive \n\n \n\nBasically, mechanical properties of scaffold should match with the tissue at the \n\nimplantation sites and provide the correct stress environment for the neotissues2,6. \n\nBiocompatibility is needed; in which generation of any unwanted tissue response to the \n\nimplant is avoided so that not inflammatory response occurs3. In the case of \n\nbiodegradability, scaffold is required to degrade in a controlled manner to facilitate load \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Literature Review \n\n \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\ntransfer to develop bone and allow bone growth into the defect. Furthermore, it is \n\ncompulsory for the degradation products to be non-toxic to the body3. High interconnected \n\nporosity structure and high surface area are needed to allow cell adhesion, proliferation, \n\nfacilitating cell contacts, and cell migration in order to encourage bone ingrowths and \n\nrepair1,2 \n\nOsteoconductive materials are preferable, in which the properties of a material \n\nshow an ability to support bone growth by providing a site for cell attachment and vascular \n\ningrowth3. Another requirement is bioactivity; bioactive materials allow and enhance the \n\nformation of apatitic layer which allow bonding to the bone tissue. \n\n \n\n2.1.1. Mechanical Properties \nIn the case of mechanical properties, porous scaffold materials should match with \n\nthe properties of target sites. It should be able to give enough strength to the damaged \n\nlocations and in the same time allow gradual load transfer in order to facilitate the newly \n\ngrowth tissue for bone recovery3.  \n\nBone has very unique mechanical properties which are originated from its chemical \n\ncomponents and hierarchical organization13, 14, 15. As shown in Figure 2-1, bone is a \n\ncomplex biological material which consists of collagen fibril and HA crystal. Inorganic \n\nmaterial which is mainly HA covers 60% composition of bone, organic material covers \n\n30%, and the remaining 10% is water. This composition makes bone with outstanding \n\nmechanical properties in which the compressive strength is originated from the rigid HA, \n\nwhile collagen fibrils are capable of energy dissipation and impart the tensile properties3. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2-1 Hierarchically structured biological material in which the building components are \nprecisely arranged at scales (left)13. Nanocomposite consisting of crystal HA and collagen fibril in bone \n\n(right)15  \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Literature Review \n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nTwo types of bone exist in human body, i.e. cortical bone and cancellous bone. \n\nCortical bone which covers 80% of adult skeleton is hard, compact, dense bone which \n\nposses only 10% porosity3. Its strength values are 79-151MPa in tension and 131-224MPa \n\nin compression; its modulus is 17-20GPa in both compression and tension. Cancellous \n\nbone on the other hand is spongy and may have 50-90% porosity. Its compressive strength \n\nis 4-12MPa and its modulus is 0.1-0.5GPa13.  \n\nFigure 2-2 shows a comparison of mechanical properties between several polymer \n\nand ceramic-based biomaterials with natural bone. It is shown that dense biodegradable \n\npolymer has close mechanical properties with cancellous bone, and dense bioactive \n\nceramics with cortical bone21. However, when it comes to porous materials, mechanical \n\nproperties of both porous biodegradable polymer and porous bioactive ceramics need to be \n\nimproved. By combining the two materials: ceramics and polymer; porous biodegradable \n\ncomposites are able to improve the mechanical properties closer to cancellous bone. \n\n \nFigure 2-2 Mechanical properties (both compressive strength and elastic modulus) of biodegradable \n\npolymer, bioactive ceramics and composite21 \n\n \n\nA huge number of materials including the class of synthetic polymers (PLA, PGA, \n\nPCL, PPF), natural polymers (chitosan, collagen), bioactive ceramics, bioactive glass, and \n\npolymer-ceramic composite21 have been investigated to imitate the properties of bone. In \n\nthe area of porous biodegradable composite, numerous researches have been done; for \n\ninstance amorphous CaP, HA, Bioglass were used to reinforce PLGA, PLLA, and PLA21, \n\nchitosan9,10,11, and collagen16. Boccaccini and Maquet achieved three times higher \n\ncompressive modulus of PLGA by addition of 50%wt of bioglass17, Zhang and Zhang9  \n\nwere able to improve compressive modulus of chitosan from 0.967 to 2.191 MPa and the \n\nyield strength from 0.109 to 0.208 MPa with reinforcement of ?-TCP. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Literature Review \n\n \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n2.1.2. Scaffold Morphology \nControl of scaffold morphology is very crucial for its application in tissue \n\nengineering since it influences its degradation kinetics, mechanical properties, and also \n\ncontrols the cellular colonization rates and organization within an engineered tissue18.  \n\nHigh porosity and critical pore size are essential. High interconnected porosity is \n\nneeded to facilitate diffusion of nutrients and waste (degraded materials); it also supports \n\nthe vascularization of ingrown tissue. A typical porosity of 90% is obligatory for good \n\nvascularization and cell penetration. Large surface area is needed for cell attachment and \n\ngrowth; while large pore volume is required to facilitate sufficient place for tissue repair. A \n\ncertain pore size is necessary to be fulfilled depending on the type of applications; in the \n\ncase of bone optimum size should be in the range of 100-350\u00b5m, 20-125\u00b5m for adult \n\nmammalian skin, 5-15 for fiberblast ingrowth, etc2. \n\nTable 2-2 illustrates the pore size and porosity dependence of bone regeneration \n\ndevelopment as summarized by Yang et al.2. It is known that porosity is one important \n\nvariable for bone regeneration after one research which shows that there was no new bone \n\nformed on the solid particle, while in porous scaffold direct osteogeneis occurred19. \n\nHowever, it is not only porosity which influence bone growth as shown in Table 2-2, but \n\nalso pore size. One material with porosity of 33.5% with very small pore (2-6\u00b5 m) shows \n\nno tissue ingrowth. \n\nIn the point of view of pore size, from Table 2-2, research from Klawitter et al.19  \n\nwhich implanted calcium aluminate cylindrical pellet to dog femorals showed that pore \n\nsize of ~100\u00b5 m is typical minimum pore for bone regeneration. Data provided by Whang \n\net al.20 shows that higher pore size (<350\u00b5 m) showed significant bone growth, however \n\nthis data is not complete since unavailability of the pore distribution. On contradiction to \n\nKlawitter et al., one research with titanium plates which were implanted to rabbit femorals \n\ndefects under non-load-bearing showed that all pore sizes (50, 75, 100, and 125 \u00b5 m) \n\nindicated no significant differences in the ingrowth bone19. These suggested that ~100 \u00b5 m \n\nmay not be the critical pore for non-load-bearing applications. Whang et al.20 also \n\nsucceeded to prove another method of bone growth via hematoma stabilization. In this \n\ncase, scaffold with porosity of 90% and pore size in the range of 16-32 \u00b5 m are capable of \n\nosteoinduction to grow new bone.  \n\n   From those descriptions, minimum pore size for bone regeneration may not be \n\n~100 \u00b5 m for some cases: such as non-load bearing conditions and another mechanism of \n\nbone growth based on hematoma stabilization. However, it is suggested to have at least \n\n100 \u00b5m in order to allow proper cell penetration and vascularization of the ingrown \n\ntissue2,21. Furthermore, pore size bigger than 300 \u00b5 m is recommended due to enhance new \n\nbone formation while small pores favored hypoxic conditions in which there is a lack of \n\noxygen and ultimately can cause bone diseases19. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Literature Review \n\n \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nTable 2-2 Studies defining optimal pore size for bone regeneration2 \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2-3 shows several typical morphologies of porous scaffold which are \n\nproduced with different manufacturing techniques.

Scaffold Biodegradability \nIn most cases, implanted scaffolds are supposed to degrade prior to the insertion to \n\nthe body. Instance or partially degradation is expected to occur while the tissues or organs \n\nremodel and grow1, 25. In the view point of TE applications, understanding of degradation \n\nmechanism is crucial. How these materials degrade, how long time is needed to degrade, \n\nand what is the degradation product need to be studied prior to its application in human \n\nbody. Tunable degradation time and non-toxic waste of degradation are urgent in TE \n\napplications. Toxic waste of degradation process might trigger the occurrence of \n\ninflammatory response \n\nCeramic and metal materials are known to have limited and non biodegradability. \n\nOn the contrary, most of polymers are biodegradable2. Basically, there are two main \n\nmechanisms of polymer materials degradation in vivo: enzymatic and non-enzymatic \n\ndegradation process. Synthetic polymer such as PLA, PGA, PLLA degrades through non-\n\nenzymatic degradation which involves de-esterification process21. One issue which \n\naddresses to synthetic polymer degradation is the possibility of strong inflammation to \n\noccur if the acidic degradation product is released abruptly. On the contrary of synthetic \n\npolymers; natural polymers degrade mainly by enzymatic process; for example chitosan \n\nwhich degrade through hydrolysis of acetylated residues by lysozyme1. \n\nBiodegradation time of scaffolds is supposed to be able to be tuned easily \n\ndepending on its certain application. By combining ceramics with polymers, for instance, \n\none can tailor the degradation time of the produced scaffold. Boccaccini et al.17 succeeded \n\nto retard the degradation time of PLGA by addition of bioglass.  \n\nA wide range of degradation time depending on type of materials is available. \n\nPLGA basically degrades too quickly in which they lost 50% of their tensile strength \n\nduring two weeks; while PGA degrades too slowly where 3-6 years are needed for \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Literature Review \n\n \n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\ncomplete resorption1. Others example are poly(propylene fumarate) or PPF in which lose \n\nabout 13.6-27.9% of their weight during 12 hours in PBS immersion; poly(glycolide-co-\n\ncaprolactone) or PGCL lose 50% mass during 6 weeks25.    \n\n \n\n2.1.5. Scaffold as Drug Delivery System \nBasically, human body has the ability of initiating tissue regeneration after injury, \n\nsuch as in bone marrow and skin. However, this ability varies much depending on size and \n\ncause of injury, and also on the age of each individual. In this case, having drug which can \n\nsupport and stimulate the regeneration process will be advantageous. Scaffold which can \n\ncombine synergies of the porous support structure and of the drug delivery for promoting \n\nbone tissue regeneration may be envisaged the solution for this challenge.  \n\n \nFigure 2-5 Schematic illustration of the most common strategies to fabricate DDS in 3-D scaffold: \n\ndrugs adsorption either in their unprotected (a) or protected (b) forms and drug entrapment either in \ntheir unprotected (c) or protected (d) forms 6 \n\n \nDelivery system has been applied in several therapies, such as: delivery of insulin, \n\nanticancer, anti-inflammatory agents, growth factors, etc26. Regarding to bone \n\nregeneration, several bioactive molecules and/or drugs can be loaded into the carriers (i.e. \n\nscaffold): (1) biomolecules or also known as growth factors 14, 27, 28  such as BMP/bone \n\nmorphogenetic protein, EGF/epidermal growth factor, PDGF/platelet-derived growth \n\nfactor, TGF-?1/transforming growth factor-beta1, FGF/fibroblast growth factors, \n\nVEGF/vascular endothelial growth factor, (2) antibiotics such as gentamicin, tetracycline, \n\nciprofloxacin, polymiyxin B and (3) anti-inflammatory drug such as dexamethasone, \n\nibuprofen6.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Literature Review \n\n \n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\nSeveral types of carriers have been used in drug delivery, such as nanoparticles, \n\nmicrospheres, membranes, rods, hydrogels and also 3D scaffolds28, 29. In the case of \n\nscaffolds, the drugs can be loaded into the scaffold by using several techniques, as shown \n\nin Figure 2-5. The drugs can be adsorbed or entrapped and also protected (with \n\nmicrospheres) or unprotected. Furthermore, the preparation method also influences \n\nwhether the drug release is dominated by diffusion or degradation of the matrix.  \n\nIdeally the drugs are delivered locally into the injured sites in controlled release \n\nmanner which allows an adequate concentration level to be built up in a certain desired \n\ntime. This is the benefit of having controlled drug delivery system, offering a tailored drug \n\nrelease pattern. Without controlled release, the drug might be released quickly thus \n\nenabling the possibility of the entire drug amount to be supplied before the infection stop.  \n\nThe materials which have been used as drug delivery are varied, from polymers to \n\ninorganic materials28. The polymers which can be applied as drug delivery systems can be \n\ndivided into two main groups: (a) natural polymers, including alginate, chitosan, and \n\ncollagen; and (b) synthetic polymers, including polyesters, polyaminoamides, \n\npolyacrylates, and their copolymers and blends. All these biodegradable materials degrade \n\nduring its application while releasing the loaded-drug. \n\n \n\n2.2. Scaffold Materials Choices \n \nBasically, there are three main types of materials which can be used to prepare \n\nscaffolds, i.e. polymers, ceramics, and composites.  \n\nBoth natural and synthetic polymers have been used in tissue engineering \n\napplications. Natural polymers; such as collagen, gelatin, chitin, chitosan, alginate, \n\ncellulose, starch14, 33 have been widely applied. However poor mechanical performance of \n\nsome of them limits their usage. Synthetic polymers, belonging mainly to the \n\npolylactic/polyglycolic acid group, have been in use for more than 20 years in surgical \n\nsutures2.  \n\nA wide range of ceramics has been employed in biomedical applications. In the \n\nfield of bone regeneration, HA-based CaP compounds and bioactive glass have been the \n\nmost widely used due to their bioactivity and osteoconductivity properties. \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Literature Review \n\n \n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\nTable 2-4 Summary of Scaffold Materials Choices12 \n\nBiomaterials Positive Negative \nCeramics   \nCaP (e.g. HA, triCaP, and biphasic \nCaP) \n\n1.

Chitosan \n \n\nNaturally derived polymers are of special interest mainly due to their degradability, \n\nbiocompatibility, low cost, and availability30. Besides, as natural component of living \n\nstructures, their biological and chemical similarities to natural tissues are also the reasons \n\nwhy they are used abundantly in TE1.  \n\nBasically, there are two main classes of natural origin polymers which have been \n\nwidely used: protein-based polymers and polysaccharide or carbohydrate-based \n\npolymers33,30. Protein-based polymers, such as collagen, gelatin, and fibrin, have the \n\nadvantage of mimicking many features of extracellular matrix and thus have the potential \n\nto promote better cell migration, growth, and organization during tissue regeneration30. \n\nPolysaccharide class such as chitosan, alginate, hyaluronan, and starch, have very good \n\ncompatibility with blood (haemocompatibility properties) which might be due to their \n\nchemical similarities with heparin (component of blood)14, 30.  \n\nChitosan is a linear polysaccharide, derived from chitin by (partial) deacetylation of \n\nchitin in the solid state under alkaline condition (NaOH concentrated) or by enzymatic \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Literature Review \n\n \n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\nhydrolysis in the presence of chitin deacetylase31. It is composed of glucosamine and N-\n\nacetyl glucosamine units linked by ? (1-4) glucosidic bonds1. The structure of both \n\nchitosan and chitin can be seen in Figure 2-6. Chitin is the second most abundant polymer \n\nafter cellulose. It can be obtained from exoskeleton of arthropods, such as shrimp, and also \n\nfrom the cell walls of fungi and yeast31. The properties of chitin and chitosan such as \n\nbiocompatibilty and nontoxicity make them important materials in biomedical \n\napplications.   \n\nChitosan can be used in the form of gel sponge, membrane, bead, and porous scaffold. \n\nIts easy processability by dissolving it in acid solution (pH &lt;6), makes chitosan become \n\none of the most used materials in biomedical applications. The practical use of chitosan \n\nhas been developed recently by modification to improve its solubility or to introduce \n\ndesired properties. The main chemical modifications applied to chitosan work based on \n\ngraft copolymerization and chemical grafting32, 1. Some examples of modified chitosan \n\napplications are: (1) specific recognition of cell can be introduced to chitosan by sugar \n\nmodification; such as galactosylated chitosan for hepatocyte attachment, (2) sialic acid \n\nbounded chitosan to inhibit influenza1, (3) ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) \n\ngrafted onto chitosan increases the antibacterial activity of chitosan32, etc. Furthermore, \n\nfunctional biomaterials made from chitosan have been used in wide range of applications, \n\nsuch as tissue engineering (both cartilage and bone), wound dressing, drug delivery, and \n\ncancer diagnosis31. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2-6 Structure of Chitin and Chitosan31 \n\n \nThe illustration of chitosan applications in tissue engineering field is shown in Figure \n\n2-7. Chitosan can be processed with cells and combined also with other biomaterials (such \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Literature Review \n\n \n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\nas bioceramics: CaP; and other polymers like gelatin). Chitosan scaffolds for tissue \n\nengineering application are mainly produced by lyophilization, as can be seen in Figure \n\n2-7. Despite all advantages of using chitosan as mentioned above, several drawbacks of \n\nusing chitosan are found, such as their poor mechanical properties and absence of \n\nbioactivity. In order to overcome these problems and obtain better properties, \n\nreinforcement with inorganic bioactive particles might be one of the solutions. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2-7 Illustrations of selected examples of chitosan scaffold processing in tissue engineering (from \nleft to right): (1) in situ gelling, (2) lyophilization, (3) wet spinning, (4) and (5) lyophilization of mixture \n\nof chitosan solution and calcium phosphate and other polymer (gelatin)23 \n \n\n2.2.2. Calcium Phosphates \n \n\nAn extensive variety of ceramics has been utilized in the area of medical applications \n\ndue to their positive interactions with human body, such as: CaPs, silica, alumina, zirconia, \n\nand titanium dioxide. The characteristics of these ceramics are usually high mechanical \n\nstrength, good-body response, and low or non-existing biodegradability33. One type of \n\nceramics which have been used widely is calcium phosphate (CaP), mainly class of \n\ncalcium orthophosphate34 which naturally exist as the main compounds of bone and teeth.  \n\nAmong wide range of CaP compounds (as shown in Table 2-5), HA is one type of \n\nceramics which is applied most in bone tissue field since around 60% of bone is made \n\nfrom HA21, 35. HA have an outstanding biocompatibility due to their close chemical and \n\ncrystal resemblance to bone mineral. Besides HA, ?-TCP and BCP (mixture between TCP \n\nand HA) are also used extensively.  \n\nIn the point of view of biodegradability, ?-TCP degrades faster than HA. However, \n\nwhen it is pHA (precipitates HA which contains smaller crystallites size) compared to \n\nsintered HA, the biodegradation is strongly enhanced due to higher solubility36. Regarding \n\nthe mechanical properties, it depends on several factors: porosity, composition, \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Literature Review \n\n \n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\nmicrostructure, and flaws/reliability16. Increase in pore size and porosity lead to lower \n\nmechanical strength. In the point of view of composition, one study shows that in BCP, \n\nincreasing the amount of ?-TCP resulted in lower mechanical strength16. Regarding \n\nbiological response, these CaP compounds might also behave differently. Kruyt et al. \n\ninvestigated the bone ingrowth of HA, BCP, and ?-TCP by addition of BMSC (bone \n\nmarrow stromal cells). The results show that bone ingrowth was better in BCP and ?-TCP \n\ncompared to HA33.  \n\n \nTable 2-5 Abbreviations of CaP-compounds with corresponding chemical formula and Ca/P-ratio33 \nAbbreviat\nion \n\nName Formula Ca/P-Ratio \n\nACP Amorphous Calcium Phosphate - 1.25<x<1.55 \nBCP Biphasic Calcium Phosphate Ca3(PO4)2+Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 1.50<x<1.67 \nCA Carbonated apatite, dahlite Ca5(PO4,CO3)3 1.67 \nCDHA Calcium deficient Hydroxyapatite Ca10-x(HPO4)x(PO4)6-x(OH)2-x 1.50<x<1.67 \nDCPA Dicalcium Phosphate anhydrous, \n\nMonetite \nCaHPO4 1.00 \n\nDCPD Dicalcium Phosphate dihydrate, Brushite CaHPO4.H2O 1.00 \nHA Hydroxyapatite Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 1.67 \nMCPM Monocalcium Phosphate monohydrate Ca(H2PO4)6.H2O 0.50 \nOCP Octacalcium Phosphate Ca8H2(PO4)6.5H2O 1.33 \npHA Precipitated Hydroxyapatite Ca10-x(HPO4)x(PO4)6-x(OH)2-x 1.50<x<1.67 \n?-TCP ?-Tricalcium Phosphate, Whitlockite ?-Ca3(PO4)2 1.50 \n?-TCP ?-Tricalcium Phosphate, Whitlockite ?-Ca3(PO4)2 1.50 \nTTCP Tetracalcium Phosphate, Hilgenstockite CaO.Ca3(PO4)2 2.00 \n\n \nCaP compounds can be used in the form of granules, cement (granules with \n\nphosphate salt and water), and 3D scaffold. The type of 3D scaffold employed can be non-\n\nporous or porous as can be seen in Figure 2-8. However, a number of drawbacks are found \n\nwhen using ceramics scaffold, such as: slow degradability and too brittle mechanical \n\nproperties. \n\n \nFigure 2-8 Typical ceramic 3D-structure prepared by 3D printing : a. contain only macroporous; b. \n\ncontain both macroporous &amp; micropores33 \n\nHA Fibers Precipitations \nBesides 3D scaffold, as mentioned before, CaP compound can be used in the form \n\nof granules and cement. Furthermore, these days, CaP fibers or whiskers are used to \n\nimprove mechanical properties of ceramic matrix. For these purposes, HA crystal \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Literature Review \n\n \n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\npreparation has been investigated extensively. Basically, there are two main methods to \n\nsynthesize HA powders: (1) dry chemical method which include solid-state reaction and \n\n(2) wet chemical method which include hydrothermal reaction, precipitation, and \n\nhydrolysis methods37. By varying the synthesis route, HA particles may display different \n\nmorphologies (shape and size) as can be seen in Figure 2-9. Plate-shaped apatites can be \n\nsynthesized by the hydrothermal process using an organic medium. Spherical and fibre-\n\nshaped apatites were prepared by ultrasonic spray-pyrolysis, by homogenous precipitation \n\nmethod, by solid state synthesis at high temperature and by sol-gel process56, 38. \n\n \nFigure 2-9 Various types of HA morphologies13  \n\nOne popular way to prepare HA crystals is homogenous precipitation. It is claimed \n\nto be an easy way to obtain uniform HA particles39 and tailor the morphologies38. It was \n\nfound that additives can define the final precipitates. The additives can be organic solvents \n\n(acetone, methanol, ethanol, buthanol, ethylene glycol, and glycerin) and cations (Na+, K+, \n\nMg2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Al3+, and Y3+). The final crystal can be spherical or fiber-like depending \n\non the additives38.  \n\nZhang et al.39 and Aizawa et al.56 succeeded to produce HA fibers with uniform \n\nmorphology and good crystalinity. A mixture of 0,167 mol/L calcium ions and 0,1 mol/L \n\nphosphate ions were refluxed in a certain temperature. Ca(NO3)2 was used as the source of \n\ncalcium; (NH4)2HPO4 as the source of phosphate; and urea as additive. Zhang et.al studied \n\ndifferent synthetic temperature and time (120h at 85oC, 72h at 90oC, and 48h at 95oC), \n\nwhile Aizawa et.al 56 used 24h at 80oC and followed by 72h at 90oC. It is temperature, \n\nsynthetic time, pH of the solution, concentration of Ca2+ and PO4\n3- which become the main \n\nfactor to influence the HA morphology. \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Literature Review \n\n \n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\nHydroxyapatite precipitation process may not be a straightforward process since \n\ndifferent types of CaP solid phases may precipitate depending on the precipitating medium \n\ncomposition and pH. The formation of HA follows a multistep route which includes solid-\n\nsolid transformations13, 40. The CaP phases involved are: dicalcium phosphate anhydrate \n\n(DCPA) or monetite, octacalcium phosphate (OCP) and hydroxapatite (HA). The \n\nprecipitation of any phase requires supersaturation conditions, being the solubility of each \n\nphase a pH dependent parameter. At pH 2.22-5.92, the precipitation order is usually: \n\nHA>>OCP>>Monetite39.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2-10 Solubility isotherms of calcium phosphate phases in the ternary system of Ca(OH)2-H3P04-\nKN03-H2O at 37 C\n\n41. The most important CaP compounds may form and subsequently dissolve \ndepending on the solubility depending on this curve \n\n2.2.3. Chitosan/CaP Composite \n \n\nCombining polymers with ceramics to produce composite scaffold have became \n\none very interesting research approach. Polymer scaffolds have poor mechanical properties \n\nand furthermore in the case of chitosan, lack of bioactivity. Conversely, ceramics scaffolds \n\nare too brittle and less biodegradable than polymers. Thus composite scaffolds combining \n\nthese two kinds of materials are expected to present better properties. One problem may \n\narise from composite scaffold manufacturing is as this process might be complex. \n\nA number of researches have been carried out on the topic of chitosan/CaP \n\nscaffold. Different phases of CaP were used to prepare scaffold; ?-TCP7,9,10; nano-HA42, 43, \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Literature Review \n\n \n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\nand some references used a mixture of CaP invert glasses (consists of CaO, P2O5, TiO2 and \n\nNa2O)\n7,10. Not only variation of the inorganic part, some researches were carried out using \n\nchitosan/HA and combination of other polymers, such as gelatin44,45 and alginate46. \n\nThermally induced phase separation (TIPS) which involves freezing and freeze \n\ndrying is the manufacturing technique mainly used to prepare chitosan/CaP scaffold. \n\nComposite scaffolds of chitosan and ?-TCP, HA, and invert glass were prepared by \n\naddition of CaP powder to a chitosan solution (normally in acetic acid). The solution was \n\nput in a container/mold which afterward determines the shape of the scaffold. Instead of \n\nusing mold, Ang et al.47 used a robotic desktop rapid prototyping to fabricate the scaffold. \n\nThe next step prior to both methods is similar which are freezing and subsequently freeze-\n\ndrying.   \n\nComposite scaffold of chitosan/nano-HA were prepared by two methods: (1) \n\naddition of Ca(NO3)2 and (NH4)2HPO4 to a chitosan solution; and nano-HA (140-260nm) \n\nwas formed during the process8; this process is called in situ and (2) addition of nano HA \n\npowder42. Chitosan/?-TCP was prepared by adding directly the powder to chitosan \n\nsolution prior to freezing.  \n\nIt was reported that several properties were improved by combining chitosan and \n\nCaP. Regarding the mechanical properties, Zhang et al.10 succeeded to increase the \n\nmechanical properties of chitosan scaffolds by addition of ?-TCP. The adjustment of the \n\ntype and the amount of the reinforcement enable the production of scaffolds with different \n\nmicrostruture morphology, mechanical properties, and degradation rates too. \n\nNot only mechanical properties, biocompatibility and bioactivity of chitosan/CaP \n\ncomposite scaffold were also improved. Bioactivity test by immersing composite scaffolds \n\non SBF showed (1) mass increase of the chitosan/nHA scaffold which means apatite layer \n\nwere formed8 and (2) concentration decrease of the Ca and P concentrations in SBF \n\nsolution after immersion of chitosan/?-TCP composite scaffold10. Biocompatibility study \n\nby seeding pre-osteoblasts MC3T3-E142,8 and human osteoblast-like MG6348, shows \n\nhigher population of cell on composite scaffold of chitosan/nHA. This means that \n\ncomposite scaffolds have superior cytocompatibility. \n\n \n\n2.3. Scaffold Manufacturing Techniques \n \nVarious manufacturing techniques have been reported to produce polymer \n\ncomposite scaffolds, such as TIPS, solvent casting/particle leaching, solid free-form \n\nfabrication, microsphere sintering, scaffold coating, fiber bonding, high pressure \n\nprocessing, hydrocarbon templating, electrospinning, microsphere sintering, and melt \n\nmolding, etc2, 14, 21. Among those manufacturing techniques, solvent casting with or \n\nwithout particle leaching and TIPS combined with freeze-drying are two very popular \n\nmethods for preparing polymer composite scaffold.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Literature Review \n\n \n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\n2.3.1. Overview on scaffold manufacturing method \n \n\nSolvent casting/particulate leaching and TIPS are two methods that require the raw \n\nmaterials to be soluble in order to be processed. Solvent casting procedure involves the \n\ncasting of a polymer/salt/organic mixture solution followed by solvent evaporation and \n\nremoval of the salt by dissolution50. In solvent casting (as shown in Figure 2-11), the \n\npolymer solution is poured into a bed of porogen (the porogen can be salt particles, \n\nparaffin microspheres or emulsion drops of defined size). To evaporate the solvent, freeze \n\ndrying can be applied. The porogen removal can be achieved by rinsing with distilled \n\nwater or with an organic solvent2. In this way, the pore size can be tailored by the size of \n\nthe porogen and the porosity can be tailored by ratio of the polymer and the amount of \n\nporogen49. However, two main limitations on using solvent casting are harmful solvents \n\nand limited thickness of porous scaffold (film) can be produced. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2-11 Illustration on scaffold manufacturing using particle leaching method50 \n\n \n\nTIPS is one very popular technique to fabricate 3D porous scaffold with high \n\nvolume of interconnected micropores. In TIPS, the polymer is dissolved in a certain \n\nsolvent. Liquid-liquid or solid-liquid phase separation is induced by lowering the \n\ntemperature. The solvent is then sublimated and leaves a porous polymer scaffold2, 21. The \n\nlimitations of this process are the following: quite long time is needed to sublimate the \n\nsolvent completely, and shrinkage issues are also a concern. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Literature Review \n\n \n\n \n\n22 \n\n \n\n \n\n    \nFigure 2-12 Typical morphologies of porous scaffold made by different methods: (a) thermally induced \n\nphase separation, (b) solvent casting and particle leaching, (c) solid-free-from techniques, (d) \nmicrosphere sintering, and (e) cancellous bone21 \n\n \nTable 2-6 Scaffold Manufacturing Techniques List50 \n\nFabrication \n\nTechnology \n\nRequired \n\nproperties \n\nAvailable pore \n\nsize (\u00b5m) \n\nPorosity \n\n(%) \n\nArchitecture \n\nSolvent casting \n\n/particle leaching \n\nSoluble 30-300 20-50 Spherical pores \n\nTIPS Soluble&lt;200&lt;97 High volume of \n\ninterconnected pores \n\nMelt molding Thermoplastic 50-500&lt;80 Spherical pore \n\nGas foaming Amorphous&lt;100 10-30 High volume of \n\nnoninterconnected pore \n\nFused deposition \n\nmodeling \n\nThermoplastic >150&lt;80 100% interconnected \n\nmacropores \n\n3-D printing Soluble 45-150&lt;60 100% interconnected \n\nmacropores \n\n \n\nFor thermoplastic polymer that cannot be dissolved, melt molding, and solid free \n\nform fabrication (SFF) techniques can be used. SFF also known as rapid prototyping are \n\ncomputerized fabrication techniques using data generated by CAD systems, computer-\n\nbased medical imaging modalities, digitizers and other data makers. Several types of SFF \n\nare Solid Laser Sintering (SLS), Three-Dimensional Printing (3-DP), and Fused \n\nDeposition Modeling (FDM)51. The advantage of using SFF is the ability of tailoring \n\nporous structures and the good interface with medical imaging.  \n\nThere are still some other techniques available, such as fiber bonding, membrane \n\nlamination, melt molding, hydrocarbon templating, etc. Figure 2-12 shows a typical \n\nporous polymer scaffold produced by different methods. Table 2-6 summarizes \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Literature Review \n\n \n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\ninformation on polymer scaffolds fabrication techniques. It is clear that by using different \n\nmaterials, different methods, and also by controlling the variable in each manufacturing \n\ntechnique, the morphology of the scaffold can be tailored depending on the requirements. \n\n \n\n2.3.2. Thermally Induced Phase Separation (TIPS) \n \n\nAmong the wide range of methods for preparing scaffolds, chitosan-based scaffolds \n\nhave been mostly prepared by TIPS7,43. This probably reflects the easy preparation of \n\nchitosan solutions by dissolving chitosan in dilute acid.  \n\nTIPS works based on the principle that a single homogenous polymer solution \n\nprepared at higher temperature is converted via the removal of thermal energy to two-\n\nphase separated domains composed of a polymer-rich phase and a polymer-lean phase52. \n\nThe removal of thermal energy is done by lowering the multicomponent system so that it \n\nbecomes thermodynamically unstable and tends to separate into more than one phase in \n\norder to lower the system free energy49. After fully frozen, lyophilization/freeze drying is \n\napplied to sublimate the solvent-rich phase and leave a porous polymer scaffold. The pore \n\nmorphology is controlled by any phase transition that occurs during the cooling process54 \n\ni.e. solid-liquid phase separation or liquid-liquid separation. \n\nBasically there are two types of TIPS: solid-liquid phase separation and liquid-\n\nliquid phase separation. In solid-liquid phase separation, lowering the temperature induce \n\nsolvent crystallization from polymer solution; also define as solid formation in liquid \n\nphase49. Example of solid-liquid phase separation is the separation of chitosan-acetic acid \n\nsolution; ice of acetic acid solution are formed and separated from chitosan-rich phase. \n\nDecreasing temperature can induce liquid-liquid phase separation in the case of a polymer \n\nsolution with an upper critical solution temperature49. An example of this case is a mixture \n\nof dioxane and water which have been used to fabricate PLA &amp; PLGA scaffold52. \n\nHowever, combination of both separation types can also be used. Lim et al.53 prepared \n\nporous chitosan scaffold from chitosan-acetic acid solution with alcohol as the non-\n\nsolvent.  \n\nFigure 2-13 illustrates a binary phase diagram of polymer solution undergo three \n\ndifferent cooling route. Depending on where the end point of quenching is located, \n\nwhether (1) metastable region between binodal and spinodal curve or (2) unstable region \n\nbelow the spinodal curve, two distinctive morphologies can be achieved: (1) poorly \n\ninterconnected bead-like structure by nucleation and growth mechanism or (2) well-\n\ninterconnected open pore structure52. Several parameters in TIPS influence the final \n\nmorphologies (pore size distribution and interconnectivity) of porous scaffold: polymer \n\nconcentration, quenching rate, and composition of solvent/non solvent52, 54.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Literature Review \n\n \n\n \n\n24 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2-13 Schematic phase diagram illustrating several possibility of morphology depending on \n\ncooling route54 \n\n  \n\nAfter the occurrence of phase separation during the cooling process, the frozen \n\nsolution is freeze dried (or also known as lyophilized), i.e. the solvent is removed at very \n\nlow pressure and temperature. Such conditions allow a phase change in which the frozen \n\nsolvent (i.e. water) is converted in gas, i.e. a sublimation process. 55  \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Problem Formulation \n\n \n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\nChapter 3  \nProblem Formulation \n\n \nIn the present work, a systematic study of chitosan based composite scaffolds is \n\ncarried out. Pure chitosan and composite chitosan scaffolds using different reinforcing \n\nparticles (HA fibers, monetite platelets and mixture of fibers and platelets) and HA \n\ngranules loaded with drug) were prepared under different experimental conditions (pH of \n\nchitosan solution and freezing temperature). \n\nThe HA fibers used to reinforce the scaffolds were prepared by a precipitation \n\nmethod. In this research, two routes combining different time and temperature (4h-80oC \n\nfollowed by 24h-90oC and 24h-80oC followed by 24h-90oC)  were applied. The chemical \n\nand crystal phase composition and the morphology of the precipitated particles were \n\nstudied. \n\nRegarding chitosan based scaffolds, some experimental parameters were varied in \n\norder to obtain better microstructure, mechanical properties, and bioactivity of the \n\nresulting scaffolds. During the preparation of CH solution/suspension, the pH of the \n\nsolution and the type of reinforcement particles were varied. Two pH values were used: pH \n\n2 and pH 5. The reinforcement particles with different shape and composition were \n\nobtained by precipitation:  HA-fibers, incipient monetite thin platelets and a mixture \n\nbetween those two types of particles. Furthermore, during TIPS, different freezing \n\ntemperatures (0, -15, and -196oC (liquid N2)) were also used. The effects of these variables \n\non scaffold microstructure, mechanical properties, and bioactivity were analyzed and \n\ninvestigated.  \n\nFor exploiting the potentiality of chitosan scaffolds as a drug delivery system \n\n(DDS), dexamethasone (DEX) was selected as a model drug. HA was also selected as a \n\nprimary drug carrier. HA granules loaded with DEX were independently produced by \n\nspray drying HA nanoparticles suspended in a DEX solution. The spray dried HA granules \n\nloaded with DEX where then suspended in chitosan solution and subsequently freeze \n\ndried. Three different routes for preparing the drug loaded scaffold were adopted and their \n\ndrug release profiles were studied. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nThis research is divided in three main parts\n\nprecipitation method, preparation of \n\nscaffold and drug-loaded chitosan composite scaffold\n\nfrom part one was used to reinforce chitosan scaffold\n\nHA granules prepared by spray\n\ndescribed in Figure 4-1.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4-1 Scheme of experimental done: HA fibers precipitation and its chitosan composite (left) and \nHA granules preparation and its chitosan composite (right)\n\n4.1.

Preparation Methods \n \n\n4.2.1. Precipitation of HA Fibers  \nHA fibers were prepared by a precipitation method in aqueous solution, following a \n\nprocedure described by Aizawa et al.56. A solution of 0,167M Ca(NO3)2, 0,100M \n\n(NH4)2HPO4, 0,50 M (NH2)2CO (urea) and 0,1M HNO3 was refluxed for a certain time at \n\n80oC and 90oC.  \nTable 4-1 Raw Materials for HA Fiber Synthesize \n\nComposition Raw Material for 250 mL solution \n\nCa(NO3)2 0,167 M Ca(NO3)2.2H2O 9,85 g \n\n(NH4)2HPO4 0,100 M (NH4)2HPO4 3,30 g \n\n(NH2)2CO 0,50 M (NH2)2CO 7,50 g \n\nHNO3 0,10 M HNO3 65% 1,73 mL \n\n \n\nThe first experiment (so called batch 1) was carried out by refluxing (Figure 4-2-a) \n\nthe solution for 24h at 80oC, followed by aging at 90oC for 72h. The second experiment \n\n(so called batch 2) was done by refluxing the solution for 4h at 80oC followed by aging at \n\n90oC for 72h. \n\n Small amounts of the suspension were withdrawn in the middle of the refluxing \n\nprocess in order to follow the phase evolution. This procedure involved mixing and \n\nshaking the container to make sure that the suspension is uniformly sampled, and then \n\npouring a little amount to a beaker, filtering in vacuum filter (Figure 4-2-b), washing the \n\nsolid cake with distilled water, and drying it in the oven at 60oC. During the refluxing \n\nprocess, the pH of the solution was monitored and revealing an increasing from ~1 to ~7,5 \n\nsince NH3 was released by the hydrolysis of urea\n56.  \n\nFor batch 1, samplings were carried out at 0,5h, 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, 20h, and 24h at \n\n80oC; followed by 24h, 48h, and 72h at 90oC. For batch 2, samplings were performed at 2h \n\nand 4h at 80oC; followed by 24h, 48h, and 72h at 90oC. All the obtained dried powders \n\nwere analysed by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption using the BET isotherm (BET), \n\nand Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to characterize the powder crystal phase \n\ncomposition and morphology. \n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 4-2 (a) Reflux apparatus : round glass container equipped with cooling column immersed in \nwaterbath; (b) vacuum filter with water\n\n \n\n4.2.2.

The chitosan solution at pH ~2 was prepared by dissolving 2g of chitosan in \n\n98g acetic acid 2M (pH =2.5-2.6; further these scaffolds are referred with scaffolds pH 2). \n\nThe mixture was magnetic stirred at 50oC for 3-4 hours until complete dissolution. \n\nChitosan solution at pH ~5 was prepared by weighing 2g of chitosan powder, adding (1) \n\n~70mL of distilled water, (2) acetic acid 25% drop by drop while stirring at 50oC until \n\ncomplete dissolution (pH ~3,5), and (3) ammonia (ammonia 25% : H2O = 2:1) drop by \n\ndrop until pH ~5 was reached. Finally, distilled water was added until the total mass 100 g \n\nof the solution. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4-4 (a) Chitosan Solution Preparation with Magnetic Stirer; (b) and (c) Differently shaped \n\ncontainers used for preparing the chitosan-based scaffolds   \n\n \n\nThe composite scaffolds were prepared with a (chitosan:calcium phosphate) ratio \n\nof (2:1) by weight. Following the same procedure as described above, before adding the \n\ndistilled water to 100g of the total mass, 1 gram of calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite \n\nfibers which was obtained via precipitation method (4h 80oC+24h 90oC), monetite powder \n\n(30min of reflux), mixture of HA fibers &amp; monetite powder and spray dried-HA granules \n\nwith or without DEX) were then added to the solution. The resulting suspension was then \n\nstirred for 1 to several hours in order to homogenize. Ten minutes of sonication were also \n\nallowed in order to ensure a complete mixing. Finally, the chitosan solution or the \n\nchitosan/calcium phosphate suspension were poured into a container (a mold which \n\ndetermines the final 3D shape of the scaffold) being then ready to be frozen. \n\nThree different freezing temperature were used in this experiment, i.e. ~0oC , -15oC \n\nand -196oC (liquid N2). The freezing process at ~0\noC and -15oC were carried out during \n\n24h. Quenching in liquid N2 was carried out very rapidly, being the container directly \n\nimmersed in liquid N2 for ~4min. After freezing and quenching procedures, the solidified \n\nchitosan solution/suspension was quickly transferred to the freeze-dryer. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Experimental Procedure \n\n \n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n\nFreeze-Drying/Lyophilization \nFrozen chitosan solution/suspensions were placed in a freeze-dryer as illustrated in \n\nFigure 4-5-a. Freeze drying (also known as lyophilization) is a process aiming to remove \n\nthe solvent through a sublimation process. Labconco Freeze Dry System (operating at \n\n~52oC and 12x10-3 mbar) was used in this experiment. In order to reach complete \n\nsublimation of the solvent, 3 days of freeze-drying were applied to all the samples. \n\nParticular attention was paid to ensure that a constant pressure is required; increase of \n\npressure will not allow phase transformation from ice to water vapor directly but from ice \n\nto liquid water. If this occurs in the beginning of lyophilization, the samples might be \n\ndamaged, since chitosan (in the presence of acetic) might dissolve.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4-5 (a) Frezee-drying apparatus; (b) and (c) Various shape of CH/CH composite scaffold after \nfreeze-dried \n\n \nPostprocessing with Ethanol \n\nFreeze-dried samples were rehydrated and stabilized with ethanol treatment \n\nfollowing the procedure by Madihally et al.18 with modifications in order to remove the \n\nacetic which still existing in the scaffold. This treatment is needed in order to avoid \n\nmoisture uptake by the scaffold.  \n\nThe first treatment was done by immersing the scaffold in absolute alcohol (99%) \n\nfor 1 hour, followed by 30minutes in 70% ethanol and another 30minutes in 50% ethanol. \n\nAfter immersion in ethanol, the samples were subsequently quenched in liquid N2 and \n\nplaced again in freeze-drying for 24h.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Experimental Procedure \n\n \n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\n4.2.3. Drug-Loaded Composite Scaffold \nDrug-loaded composite scaffold was prepared with the same procedure as CH \n\ncomposite scaffold (as written in section 4.2.2) in which drug-loaded HA granules were \n\nused instead of fiber to reinforce chitosan. Pure HA granules and drug-loaded HA granules \n\nwere produced by spray-drying of HA and HA-drug suspension76. In this study, \n\ndexamethasone (DEX, Figure 4-6) as one anti-inflammatory drug was used as drug model \n\nand spray-dried with HA suspension in the proportion of 10%wt (DEX/HA). \n\n \n\nFigure 4-6 Chemical Structure of Dexamethasone80 \n\n Different procedures were used in the preparation of CH composite solution \n\ncontaining drug-loaded HA granules: (1) pure HA granules and DEX were added to CH \n\nsolution (pH ~5), (2) drug-loaded HA granules were added to CH solution (pH ~5) without \n\nany additional DEX, and (3) additional DEX was added to CH composite solution \n\nprepared with the second procedure (Table 4-2) \n\n \nTable 4-2 CH Composite Scaffold Solution/Suspension Composition for DDS \n\n Procedure 1 Procedure 2 Procedure 3 \n\n2%wt CH solution 10 g 10 g 10 g \n\nHA granules 100 mg pure HA \n\ngranules \n\n100 mg spray dried \n\nHA-DEX granules \n\n100 mg spray dried \n\nHA-DEX granules \n\nAdditional DEX - - 10 mg \n\n  \n\nCH composite solutions were magnetic-stirred and ultra-sonicated in order to \n\nprepare an homogenous solution.

Characterization \n4.3.1. Precipitation of HA Fibers  \n\nCharacterization of the as synthesized calcium phosphate powder was carried out \n\nby several methods, including: X-Ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption with the BET \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Experimental Procedure \n\n \n\n \n\n32 \n\n \n\nisotherm, and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). XRD was performed in order to \n\nidentify the powder crystal phase composition. This test was carried out in a equipment \n\nRigaku Geigerflex DMAX III/C using monochromatic CuK? (1.54056 \u00c5) radiation at \n\n40kV. The 2? scan range was 3-80o with the scanning speed 3o/min.  \n\nRelationship between shape of peaks in XRD spectra and crystallite size is \n\nexplained by The Scherrer equation57. The peak broadening can be observed when \n\ncrystallite size is smaller than 100\u00c5. Smaller crystallite size and more random oriented \n\ncrystal will have broader diffraction peaks. Scherrer equation is written in equation 4.1. \n\n? (??) =\n?. ?\n\n? ? ????\n \n\n(4.1) \n\n? =\n(2????? ? 2????)\n\n180\n? \t \n\n(4.2) \n\nwhere ? is x-ray wavelength (1.54\u00c5 in this case); c is a factor depending on crystal shape \n\n(usually in the range of 0.9-1; 0.9 is taken); B is the difference in angles at half of \n\nmaximum intensity or also called full width at half max (FWHM; which is calculated \n\nbased on equation 4.2); and ? is the Bragg angle in radian57. Monetite crystallites size were \n\nmeasured based on peak (002), OCP based on peak (010), and HA based on peak (300). \n\nIn order to calculate the relative amount of each phase in one sample, the area \n\nbelow each peak was calculated. For crystallite size calculation, the same peak area of \n\nmonetite were measured based on peak (002) at 2?=~26.5o, OCP based on peak (010) at \n\n2?=~4.6o, and HA based on peak (300) 2?=~32.5o. \n\nThe surface area of the powder was accessed by N2 adsorption at 200\noC with the \n\nBET isotherm in equipment from Micromeritics Gemini. \n\nThe powder morphology was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy Hitachi \n\nSE-70 SEM.

The specimens were cylindrical about 17-19mm high and 15-17mm in \n\ndiameter. The crosshead speed was set at 1mm/min, and the load was applied until the \n\nspecimens deformed to approximately 60-70% of its original thickness. At least three \n\nspecimens were tested for each type of samples.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4-9 Compression Test Apparatus \n\n \n\nThe strain-stress curves were built based on the data obtained from the machine. \n\nThe compressive modulus was calculated as the slope of the initial linear region; while the \n\ncompressive strength was taken from the intersection between the linear line and the \n\nplateau region.  \n\n \nIn vitro biomineralization studies \n\nIn vitro biomineralization in SBF (simulated body fluid) was done to the selected \n\nsamples to observe the bioactivity of the scaffold. The selected samples: pure CH/pH 5/(-\n\n15oC), CH-fibers/pH 2/(-15oC), and CH-fibers/pH 5/(-15oC) were chosen to compare \n\ndifferent biomineralization ability between pure &amp; composite scaffold and also the \n\ncomposite scaffold which were prepared at different pH.  \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Experimental Procedure \n\n \n\n \n\n35 \n\n \n\nSBF with the composition shown in Table 2-3 were prepared following the \n\nprocedure by Kokubo and Takadama24. The reagents which were used to prepare 500mL \n\nof SBF were listed in Table 4-3. \n\nTo prepare 500 mL of SBF, first of all, 350 mL of deionized water was put in a \n\nglass beaker and heated to 36,5\u00b11,5oC under stirring. Reagents 1 to 8 were dissolved one \n\nby one following their order. Reagent 9 (CNH2(CH2OH)3) was added drop by drop while \n\nmonitoring until it reached pH 7,45. At this value the addition of reagent 9 was stopped \n\nand HCl 1M was added in order to lower the pH to 7,42. Again reagent 9 was added until \n\npH raised to 7,45. This process was repeated until all reagent 9 was dissolved.  Finally, \n\nHCl 1M was added to adjust the pH to 7,40. The solution was poured to volumetric flask \n\nand subsequently deionized water was added until a final volume of 500mL. SBF was \n\nstored in fridge (5-10oC) and shall be used within 30 days after preparation.  \n\n \nTable 4-3 Reagents for Preparing SBF \n\nOrder Reagent Quantity Supplier Purity (%) \n1 NaCl 3,998 g Merck 99,5 \n2 NaHCO3 0,175 g Riedel-de Han 99,7 \n3 KCl 0,112 g Merck 99,5 \n4 K2HPO4.3H2O 0,114 g Merck 99 \n5 MgCl2.6H2O 0,1525 g Merck 99-102 \n6 HCl 1M 19,5 mL Prepared in the lab \n7 CaCl2.6H2O 0,274 g Fluka 99 \n8 Na2SO4 0,0359 g Panreac 99 \n9 CNH2(CH2OH)3 3,0285  g Riedel-de Han 99,5 \n10 HCl 1M 0-5 mL Prepared in the lab \n   \n\n \nFigure 4-10 Samples for bioactivity test in SBF: blank SBF (left), chitosan/chitosan composite scaffold \n\n(middle and right) \n\n \n\nBioactivity test was carried out by immersing a certain size/mass of scaffold in \n\nSBF (Figure 4-10). The scaffolds used were ethanol-treated scaffolds. As-prepared \n\nscaffold from freeze-drying cannot be used since the acetic acid left in the surface trigger \n\ndissolution of chitosan scaffold. \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Experimental Procedure \n\n \n\n \n\n36 \n\n \n\nSBF was put in plastic bottles and placed in oven to maintain the temperature at 36-\n\n37oC. The volume of SBF that was used for testing was calculated based on equation 4.3. \n\n\n? =  ??/10 (4.3) \n\n \n\nwhere Vs is the volume of SBF (mL) and Sa is the apparent surface area of specimen \n\n(mm2)22. For porous materials, the volume of SBF should be greater than the calculated \n\none.  \n\nAfter immersion for different periods of time (7, 14, and 21days), the scaffolds \n\nwere separated from the liquid part, washed with deionized water, frozen with liquid \n\nnitrogen, and freeze-dried for at least 24 hours. The morphology of the samples after being \n\nimmersed in SBF was investigated by SEM. Energy-dispersive X-Ray (EDX) \n\nspectroscopy analysis was performed on Hitachi SE-70 SEM equipped with Bruker AXS \n\nMicroanalysis. X-Ray diffraction analysis (Rigaku Geigerflex DMAX III/C) and Fourier \n\ntransform infrared spectroscopy \u2013 attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR), using FT-\n\nInfrared Bruker Optics Tensor 27 were performed to allow identification of the chemical \n\nphase or functional groups.  \n\nThe liquid parts were collected with a syringe equipped with 0.22\u00b5m filter and \n\nanalyzed by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP) to measure the Ca &amp; P \n\nconcentrations.  \n\nThe variations of Ca and P concentrations are expressed as ?Ca and ?P in mg/L \n\nwhich are calculated based on equation 4.4. and 4.5. \n\n??\n = ??\n?\t ? ??\n?\n     (4.4) \n\n?? = ???\t ? ???\n     (4.5) \n\nWhere ??\n?\t and ???\t are initial concentrations before sample immersion and \n\n??\n?\n and ???\n are concentrations after immersion of a certain time.

Figure 4-11 illustrated the drug release test in which a number of containers were \n\nprepared.

Precipitation of HA Fibers  \nThe experimental results respecting the crystal phase composition and morphology \n\naspects of the precipitated calcium phosphate (CaP) particles obtained by the refluxing \n\nmethod will be firstly presented. A comprehensive discussion aiming to compare these \n\nresults with the previous ones reported for the same method by Aizawa et al.56 will be then \n\nattempted. \n\n \n\n5.1.1. Crystal phase composition of precipitated CaP particles  \nAs mentioned in the experimental procedure, two different methodologies were \n\nfollowed aiming at obtaining HA fibers: (1) refluxing the precipitating medium at 80oC for \n\n24h and then at 90oC for 72h and (2) refluxing the solution for 4h at 80oC and then at 90oC \n\nfor 72h.  \n\nFigure 5-1 and Figure 5-2 show the evolution of the XRD spectra for the CaP \n\nprecipitates withdrawn from the precipitating medium after different periods of time. It is \n\nobserved that incipient monetite peaks start being detected after 30min of refluxing which \n\nthen become more intense and sharper after 60min (Figure 5-1). OCP diffraction peaks \n\nstarted to be noticed after 20 hours. Both the peaks of monetite and OCP became sharper \n\nwith the increase of refluxing time. After 24h at 80\u00baC monetite and OCP are still the main \n\ncrystalline phases being detected. This crystalline phase evolution of the precipitates is \n\naccompanied by a significant pH variation within the precipitating medium, from ~1 to ~5 \n\nas depicted in Figure 5-3. When the particles obtained after refluxing at 80\u00baC for 24h are \n\nnow exposed to refluxing at 90\u00baC during 72h, HA is the dominant crystalline phase with \n\nsome OCP still detected in the XRD. As shown in Figure 5-3, HA crystallization is \n\nfollowed by a pH increase to 7.5. \n\nFigure 5-2 illustrates the diffraction peak evolution for the particles precipitated by \n\nthe second methodology, i.e. the CaP precipitates obtained after 4h at 80\u00baC and then \n\nrefluxed at 90oC during 72h. After refluxing at 90oC for 24h HA peaks become noticed as \n\nwell as a strong OCP peak. As refluxing at 90\u00baC goes HA peaks become more intense \n\nwhile OCP is unnoticed. After 72h at 90\u00baC the precipitated particles evidence HA as the \n\ndominant crystalline phase with traces of monetite. It thus concluded that the increase of \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Results &amp; Discussions \n\n \n\n \n\n39 \n\n \n\nthe refluxing temperature from 80oC to 90oC has speed up the formation of HA crystalline \n\nphase.  \n\n \n\nFigure 5-1 XRD spectra of CaP precipitates showing an increase of peaks\u2019 sharpness of monetite and \nOCP during 24hours-reflux at 80oC \n\nTable 5-1 shows the crystallite size development of the three main compounds \n\ndetected in XRD (monetite, OCP, and HA) during precipitation. It is observed that both \n\nmonetite and OCP present crystallite size variation curves with maxima while HA \n\ncrystallite size values increase continuously during refluxing at 90\u00baC. Moreover it is \n\nevident that regardless the used methodology HA crystallites after refluxing at 90\u00baC are \n\nwell developed with sizes in the range 170 \u2013 180 \u00c5   \n\n \nTable 5-1 List of crystallites size which increase and decrease during reflux \n\nSamples Monetite OCP HA \n2h 80oC 61.77 \u00c5 - - \n4h 80oC 151.39 \u00c5 - - \n8h 80oC 136.81 \u00c5 - - \n20h 80oC 126.43 127.51 \u00c5 - \n24h 80oC - 226.37 \u00c5 121.25 \u00c5 \n24h-80oC + 72h-90oC  133.18 \u00c5 186.43 \u00c5 \n4h-80oC + 24h-90oC - 137.44 \u00c5 133.24 \u00c5 \n4h-80oC + 48h-90oC - 82.15 \u00c5 143.55 \u00c5 \n4h-80oC + 72h-90oC 54.97 \u00c5 - 170.08 \u00c5 \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Results &amp; Discussions \n\n \n\n \n\n40 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-2 XRD spectra showing a decrease of OCP peaks and a increase of HA peaks during reflux at \n\n90oC \n\n \nFigure 5-3 pH dependence of the reflux time and temperature during the HA precipitation process \n\n(24h 80oC + 72h 90oC) \n\n5.1.2. Crystal Morphology \nFigure 5-5 shows SEM images of CaP precipitates obtained after refluxing at 80 \n\nand 90oC for different periods of time. Different morphologies are revealed as the \n\nrefluxing time increases:  a mixture of spherical particles and thin platelets assembled in a \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Results &amp; Discussions \n\n \n\n \n\n41 \n\n \n\nflorrete-like structure is evidenced after a short period, i.e. 30min, which then converts to \n\nthicker platelet-like particles and later on to a prismatic morphology as refluxing \n\ncontinues; after longer periods fibers start to be noticed and become the dominant shape \n\nafter 24 hours. It is worthy to be mentioned that no relevant morphology change is noticed \n\nwhen the fibers obtained after refluxing at 80\u00baC are subsequently refluxed at 90\u00baC. \n\nFuthermore, it is observed that fibers are also obtained when the prismatic particles formed \n\nafter refluxing at 80\u00baC are then submitted to a 90\u00baC refluxing.  \n\nThe evolution of the specific surface area of CaP precipitates during precipitation is \n\nillustrated in Figure 5-4. The surface area decreased drastically from 30m2/g to 0.6m2/g \n\nduring the first 4 hours of refluxing being this low value maintained during the remaining \n\nrefluxing time. The subsequent refluxing at higher temperature (90\u00baC) allowed a slight \n\nincrease of the specific surface area to 2m2/g.  \n\n \nFigure 5-4 variations of precipitates specific surface area during HA precipitation process (4h 80oC + \n\n72h 90oC)  \n\n5.1.3. Growth of HA fibers \n \n\nHA particles precipitation from moderately acidic solution is also known as a soft \n\nchemical route in which no subsequent high-temperature annealing process is required for \n\nobtaining the desired crystal phase. HA fibers precipitation is a complex process since it \n\nmight not only involve nucleation and growth of a single crystalline phase but rather \n\nsecondary nucleation or phase transformation13. A number of experimental conditions \n\nwhich influence HA precipitation are known to be reagents concentrations, molar ratio of \n\nprecursor ions, pH, temperature, presence of additives among others13, 38, 39. In the present \n\nwork, Ca(NO3)2 and (NH4)2HPO4 were used as source reagents of calcium and phosphate, \n\nrespectively; HNO3 and urea were used as additives for pH control.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 5: Results &amp; Discussions\n\n42 \n\na. 30min-80oC \n\n \n\nb. 2h-80oC \n\n \n\nChapter 5: Results &amp; Discussions \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 5: Results &amp; Discussions\n\n43 \n\nc. 4h-80oC \n\n \n\nd. 8h-80oC \n\n \n\nChapter 5: Results &amp; Discussions \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 5: Results &amp; Discussions\n\n44 \n\ne. 20h-80oC \n\n \n\nf. 24h-80oC \n\n \n\nChapter 5: Results &amp; Discussions \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\ng. 4hours-80oC + 24hours\n\n \ni.  4hours-80oC + 72hours\n\nFigure 5-5 SEM Images of CaP precipitates with different time \nprecipitates in different magnifications.

For \n\ncomparative purposes, the relative amount of each phase estimated trough XRD peak area \n\ncalculations is also presented. The overall results show basically that CaP precipitation can \n\nbe divided into three main stages: (1) formation of platelets shaped monetite, (2) formation \n\nof fibers-like OCP, and (3) transformation of fibers-like OCP crystal into HA.  \n\nIn the first stage, as shown in XRD spectra on Figure 5-1, incipient monetite \n\nappeared after 30min refluxing. This is in line with the findings from H. Zhang et al.39 \n\nwhich demonstrated that during this process, urea decomposes and contributes to pH \n\nincrease until a critical (2,4-3,1) pH range where monetite starts precipitating, the sooner \n\nthe higher is the temperature: after 12 min at 95oC, 28 min at 90oC, and 46 min at 85oC. In \n\nthe present case crystalline monetite was obtained at 80\u00baC after 1 hour at pH~ 2. Other \n\nreferences which also studied HA precipitations are Aizawa et al.38, 56. However, none of \n\nthem followed the crystal morphology evolution during the precipitation process.  \n\n Monetite is the first CaP phase to be precipitated. According to CaP solubility \n\nisotherms (Figure 2-10), at pH<4.5 monetite is the most insoluble CaP phase and thus is \n\nthe first to be precipitated41. After 60min the XRD peaks became sharper indicating a \n\nhigher crystallinity which is reflected by the increase of monetite crystallite size (Table \n\n5-1). The existence of crystalline monetite is revealed by SEM images as thick platelet \n\nshaped particles which are very clearly detected after 2hours of refluxing. The specific \n\nsurface area is seen to decrease drastically during the first two hours of refluxing being \n\nthen followed by a slower decrease until 4hours (Figure 5-3). This surface area decreasing \n\nreflects the growth of the large platelet shaped particles from the small sized spherical \n\nparticles and thin platelets detected at the early stage of the refluxing (Figure 5-5). \n\nFigure 5-5 (b) also documents the heterogeneity of the precipitates.  Sphere-like \n\nmonetite on Figure 5-5 (b-left) and thick platelet-like shaped monetite Figure 5-5 (b-right) \n\ncoexists in solution after 2h of refluxing. This inhomogeneous condition might indicate \n\nthat some overlap between nucleation and growth probably took place. Further, this fact \n\nmay also explain why the final HA fibers possess a relatively wide range of size (50-\n\n300\u00b5m).  \n\nThe second stage of the precipitation process involves the formation of OCP. The \nexistence of OCP starts to be detected in the XRD spectra (Figure 5-1) after 4h-80oC \nrefluxing. The strong peaks of OCP observed in XRD spectra after 20h-80oC refluxing \ncorresponds in SEM images to fibers-like OCP (Figure 5-5 (e-f)). At this stage, the \nmonetite thick platelets and prisms previously referred transformed into fibers, being \nevident that the grow of particles with fiber-like morphology was already initiated after 4h-\n80\u00baC refluxing (Figure 5-5 (c)). According to solubility isotherms of calcium phosphate \nphases in the ternary system Ca(OH)2-H3PO4-KNO3-H2O at 37\u00baC (Figure 2-13), HA has \nlower solubility than OCP  in the 3&lt;pH<10 range. Consequently HA should be preferably \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Results &amp; Discussions \n\n \n\n \n\n48 \n\n \n\nformed instead of OCP at a precipitation temperature of 37\u00baC. As the current experiments \nare being performed at a higher temperature it is anticipated that the temperature \ndependence of OCP solubility might account for some solubility variations as compared to \nHA. Moreover it is also known that kinetic factors may have a considerable effect in \ndetermining the nature of the CaP phases that precipitate, further helped by anions and \ncations from solution which stabilizing role can not be ruled out41. These arguments may \nexplain why OCP preferentially precipitates in a pH range where the solubities of OCP and \nHA are supposed to be very close.  \n\nDuring the third stage of the precipitation the crystal phase transformation from \n\nOCP into HA fibers-like particles takes place. As can be seen in the phase composition \n\nsummary presented in Figure 5-6, that phase transformation started to occur after 20h-80oC \n\nrefluxing. OCP transformation into HA is described by the following equation 5-139: \n\n5Ca8H2(PO4)6.5H2O  ? 4Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 + 6H3PO4+ 17H2O          (5.1) \n\n    \n\n            (OCP)             (HA)  \n\nFor (4h-80\u00baC+72h-90\u00baC), the transformation of OCP into HA was completed \n\nduring refluxing at 90\u00baC though not all monetite had been converted into OCP being thus \n\nnoticed in XRD spectra (Figure 5-1). Once again arguments based on the stabilizer role of \n\nthe precipitation medium ions may be put forward to explain the slow conversion of \n\nmonetite into other thermodynamically more stable CaP phases. For (24h-80\u00baC+72h-\n\n90\u00baC), the transformation of OCP seems to be not completed yet, since a small peak of \n\nOCP still exist. The morphology variations during the last refluxing step at 90\u00baC were \n\nmeaningless. It is thus concluded that OCP is a precursor phase of HA, behaving like a \n\ntemplate for HA crystallization as HA fibers keep the shape of OCP fibers.  \n\nFigure 5-5 shows SEM images of the fibers obtained after 4h-80\u00baC refluxing and \n\nthen refluxed at 90\u00baC during different times. In spite of the differences underlying the two \n\nroutes, i.e. (24h-80\u00baC+72h-90\u00baC) and (4h-80\u00baC+72h-90\u00baC), the characteristics of the final \n\nparticles either in terms of morphology or of crystal phase composition are very alike: in \n\nboth cases HA fibers with similar size and crystallite size are the main product of the \n\nrefluxing at 90\u00baC regardless the duration of the 80\u00baC refluxing (Figure 5-5). It is thus \n\nconcluded that the incipient OCP, with fiber-like morphology, early detected at 80\u00baC after \n\na 4h refluxing was easily converted into HA fibers at 90\u00baC, even after 24h. Therefore, \n\noverall shorter precipitation times are required if refluxing temperature/time relation is \n\nconveniently manipulated. The present results demonstrate that 76hours, i.e. \n\n(4h/80\u00baC+72h/90\u00baC = 76h) are required for obtaining HA fibers which would otherwise \n\nrequire longer times (96hours), i.e.  (24h/80\u00baC+72h/90\u00baC= 96h) to precipitate. \n\n Temperature may be also manipulated towards lower values for obtaining HA \n\nfibers. The work from Zhang39 has shown that precipitation of HA at temperatures lower \n\nthan 90\u00baC is possible but after much longer times: 120 hours under 85\u00baC refluxing. \n\n\n\n \n\nDespite of its advantage\n\nprecipitation method has one main drawback.

Chitosan based Scaffolds \n \n\nTo fulfill the requirements of a scaffold for bone regeneration, a number of \n\nparameters should be met as stated in Table 2-1. In the present research, four main \n\nproperties are addressed: (1) the chemical and crystal phase composition; (2) the \n\nmicrostructure, including porosity, pore size, and interconnectivity; (3) the mechanical \n\nproperties, evaluated by compressive tests, and (4) the bioactivity. Different chitosan-\n\nbased scaffolds, unloaded and loaded with different type of CaP particles, prepared under \n\ndifferent experimental conditions of chitosan solution pH and freezing temperature will be \n\nanalyzed and comparatively discussed in the present chapter.

Influence of pH and Freezing Temperature on CH Scaffold Properties \n \n\nCH scaffolds were prepared from chitosan solutions with different pH, i.e. pH=2 \n\nand pH=5, and subsequently frozen at different temperatures, i.e. liquid nitrogen (-196\u00baC), \n\n-15\u00baC and 0\u00baC. All the samples collected from freeze drier looked like white spongy bodies \n\nbut exhibiting different shrinkage. As illustrated in figure Figure 5-8, chitosan scaffolds \n\nprepared at pH 5 showed larger shrinkage as compared to pH=2 and consequently higher \n\ngeometrical density (Table 5-3). \n\n \n\nFigure 5-8 Top views (left image) and front views (right image) of chitosan scaffolds prepared under \n\ndifferent pH conditions and frozen at (-15oC) \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Results &amp; Discussions \n\n \n\n \n\n51 \n\n \n\nTable 5-3 List of CH composite scaffolds and and respective density values prepared with different pH \nand freezing temperature \n\n \n\npH 2 pH 2 loaded pH 5 pH 5 loaded \n\n \nHA \n\nFibers \n \n\nHA \nFibers \n\nMonetite \nPowder \n\nMixture \n(HA fibers + \n\nmonetite \npowder) \n\n-196oC - - 0.0524 0.0714 - - \n\n-15oC 0.03686 0.05074 0.0541 0.0628 - 0.0689 \n\n0C - - - - 0.06167 - \n\n \n\nThese macroscopic differences were followed by microstructure variations, too. \n\nThe microstructures of the obtained chitosan scaffolds are imaged in Figure 5-10. \n\nInterconnected porous structures are generally observed but with differently sized pores, \n\nthus denoting a significant effect of pH and freezing temperature on the scaffold \n\nmicrostructure.   \n\nFor the freezing temperatures of 0oC or (-15oC), pH effects on pore size reveal a \n\nslight tendency for larger pores to be obtained at higher pH (pH=5), as shown in Figure \n\n5-10 (a b, d and e). The calculated average pore sizes presented in Figure 5-9 confirm that \n\nscaffolds prepared from chitosan solution at pH 2 resulted in slightly smaller pore size.  \n\nThe study of freezing temperature influence in chitosan and alginate has been done \n\npreviously by Madihally and Matthew18 and ZMora et al.58. The results shows similar \n\ntrend regarding to freezing temperature. However, an attempt to study the effect of pH, \n\nhaven\u2019t been done so far.  \n\n \nFigure 5-9 Effects of freezing temperature and pH of chitosan solution on mean pore size diameter of \n\nchitosan scaffolds \n\nRegarding the freezing temperature effects, a clear tendency for smaller pores as \n\nthe freezing temperature decreases is observed on the scaffolds prepared at pH 2.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5-10 SEM images of pure CH scaffold at pH 5 (top images) and pH 2 (bottom images) with freezing temperature: ~0\n\n52 \n\n \n\nSEM images of pure CH scaffold at pH 5 (top images) and pH 2 (bottom images) with freezing temperature: ~0\n196oC (right) \n\nChapter 5: Results &amp; Discussions \n\n \n\n \nSEM images of pure CH scaffold at pH 5 (top images) and pH 2 (bottom images) with freezing temperature: ~0oC(left); -15oC(middle); and -\n\n\n\nChapter 5: Results &amp; Discussions \n\n \n\n \n\n53 \n\n \n\nHowever, scaffolds prepared at pH 5 do not follow that trend and a quite different pore \n\nstructure was obtained for the freezing temperature of -196oC (liquid N2): the pores are \n\nlarger and seem to be apparently less interconnected than in the other scaffolds. \n\nFurthermore freezing scaffold at -196oC also resulted in thicker wall pore as can be seen in \n\nFigure 5-11. \n \n\n \nFigure 5-11 Higher magnification of SEM images show wall thickness of: pure CH/pH5/(-196oC) (left) \n\nand pure CH/pH5/(-15oC) (right) \n\n \n\nIt is known that the morphology of the scaffolds manufactured by thermal induced \n\nphase separation process depends on several experimental variables such as freezing \n\ntemperature, freezing rate, solution concentration, solvent type and polymer molecular \n\nweight among others18. When a chitosan solution is frozen, the magnitude of the \n\ntemperature gradient (?T) imposed during freezing quantifies the equilibrium deviation of \n\nthe solution so that the higher ?T the higher is the driving force for ice nucleation and \n\ngrowth. This reasoning anticipates that lowering freezing temperature enhances nucleation \n\nrate and thus favors smaller sized pores to be formed. The results obtained at pH=2 (Figure \n\n5-10 a, b and c) seem to fit well to this idea since they point out a trend of pore size \n\ndecrease with freezing temperature decrease. However increasing the chitosan solution pH \n\nfrom 2 to 5 originates a deviation from that trend. As observed from Figure 5-10 (d and e) \n\npore freezing at 0 or -15\u00baC resulted in pore sizes slightly larger than their counterparts at \n\npH=2, though less affected by freezing temperature variation. Furthermore, when freezing \n\nat -196 the largest pores were obtained. As these results reflect the joint effects of \n\ntemperature and pH variation it seems that chitosan solution pH plays an important role in \n\nthe scaffold microstructure design. \n\n It is known that pH variations modulate the amount of cationic groups bounded to \n\nchitosan molecule as described by equation 5-2:   \n\n  \nChit-NH2 + H3O\n\n+ ? Chit-NH3\n+ + H2O \n\n \n(5.2) \n \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Results &amp; Discussions \n\n \n\n \n\n54 \n\n \n\nChitosan bounded \u2013NH3\n+ groups impart to chitosan a polycationic condition that \n\nhelps maintaining the chains free of attractive interactions among them. This cationic \n\ncondition explains the pH dependence of chitosan solubity59. At higher pH (pH=5), \n\nbearing a smaller cationic [NH3\n+] load, chitosan chains may agglomerate easier in solution \n\nand form polymeric structures. This will also contribute to increase the viscosity of \n\nchitosan solution60 as was experimetally observed indeed: after adding NH4OH to chitosan \n\nsolution to increase its pH from 2 to 5, the resulting solution showed to be effectively more \n\nviscous. Thus, for interpreting the pH effect on pore size Figure 5-10 (a, b, d and e) it is \n\nthus suggested that the more protonated chitosan chains (pH=2) ensure a true chitosan \n\nsolution condition in which homogeneous nucleation of ice crystal occurs whereas the less \n\nprotonated chains condition (pH=5) are prone to the formation of polymeric structures \n\nwhich might offer preferential sites for ice crystal nucleation. In this condition (higher pH) \n\nand under a very fast freezing imposed to the solution (-196\u00baC) it is here suggested that \n\ncationic sites probably play as favorable sites for ice nuclei formation and thus, as \n\ncompared to the first condition (lower pH), a lower amount of ice nuclei is formed and \n\nthus allowed to grow further. \n\nThe large pores obtained after freezing in liquid N2 indicate that freezing under \nliquid nitrogen temperature did favor ice crystal growth rather than ice crystal nucleation. \nIt is thus postulated that the scarcity of cationic groups limits the benefit of large ?T in \nnucleation rate which starts occurring at preferential cationic sites; once nucleated, the ice \nnuclei find appropriate conditions (large ?T) to undergo a higher growing rate as \ncompared to the other freezing conditions. \n\n5.2.2. Chitosan/CaP Composite Scaffolds \n \n\nIn the present section the effects of the processing conditions (pH and freezing \n\ntemperature) and of the used CaP particles as reinforcement elements on CH/CaP \n\ncomposite scaffolds characteristic are analyzed and discussed. Two different reinforcement \n\nparticles were used in this current research: HA fibers (4h-80oC+72h-90oC reflux), \n\nflorrete-like monetite powder (30min-80oC reflux) and a mixture between these two \n\nparticle type  was also used in order to understand their differences. \n\n \n\n5.2.2.1. Scaffold Microstructure \nChitosan scaffolds loaded with different types of CaP particles were produced from \n\nCaP particles suspensions in chitosan solutions upon freezing at -196\u00baC, -15\u00baC or 0\u00baC. As \n\nnoticed before the variation of CH solution pH produced a significant effect on the freeze \n\ndried CH-HA scaffold either at a macroscopic level either from the microstructure point of \n\nview. Following the same tendency exhibited by CH scaffolds (discussed in the previous \n\nsection) the preparation from pH 5 solutions originated larger shrinkage. The calculated \n\ngeometrical densities values presented in Table 5-3 reflect this pH shrinkage tendency. \n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 5-12 illustrates the microstructure of the freeze\n\nloaded with different types of CaP particles (CH\n\nparticles for scaffolds loading are also presented in the same figure: (i) HA \n\nby the method (4h-80\u00baC+72h-\n\nFigure 5-12 SEM images of reinforcement particles\nand its produced scaffolds: CH-fibers at \n\n~0oC/pH 5(g) and mixture of incipient monetite and HA fibers at \n\nIn general, the scaffolds microstructures evidence porous bodies with differently \n\nsized open pores uniformly distributed with an apparent high degree of interconnectivity. \n\nHigher magnification views of the pore walls also allows us to detect the presence of the \n\nfibers embedded in the polymeric wall\n\nprepared at pH 5 where fibers are clearly revealed (\n\nChapter 5: Results &amp; Discussions\n\n55 \n\nlustrates the microstructure of the freeze-dried chitosan scaffolds \n\nloaded with different types of CaP particles (CH-HA scaffolds).

CH composite scaffolds prepared by \n\nquenching in liquid N2 showed to display the lowest interconnectivity and porosity which \n\nconfirmed the indication of SEM images (Figure 5-13) that this scaffold seems to be less \n\ninterconnected than the remaining ones. Composite scaffolds prepared at -15oC under two \n\ndifferent pH values showed similar porosity values, nearly similar interconnectivity and the \n\nsame tendency of pore size variation evidenced by SEM pictures.  \n\nThe obtained values of porosity and interconnectivity for the scaffolds CH-\n\nfiber/pH5/-15oC and CH-fiber/pH2/-15oC are quite satisfactory. The porosity value which \n\nis 90.7% is within in the range of the porosity typically required for promoting proper new \n\nbone growth (90%)21. The interconnectivity degrees, i.e. 98.5 and 98 respectively, are \n\nextremely valuable for perfusion and cell migration63. \n\nQuenching composite solution in liquid nitrogen resulted in lower porosity and \n\ninterconnectivity degree. The value of porosity which is 80.6% is relatively low for bone \n\nregeneration. Regarding to interconnectivity degree, a clear reference to a minimum value \n\ncould not be found in the literature, so far. For comparison, Darling and Sun63 obtained \n\nPCL scaffold with interconnectivity degree in the range of 98.16-99.59% and Ho and \n\nHutmacher64  gained 100% interconnectivity by preparing scaffolds from copolymer of \n\nPEG, PCL and PLA with rapid prototyping. As compared to these data, 91.6% of \n\ninterconnectivity seems to be apparently low.  \n\n5.2.2.2. Phase Composition \nFigure 5-15 shows the XRD spectra of CH-HA fibers composite scaffolds prepared \n\nat different pH, i.e. pH=2 and pH=5. It is observed that the scaffold obtained from pH 5 \n\nchitosan solution reflects the peaks of HA superimposed on a baseline showing the \n\nchitosan hump at 2?=20\u00ba. However for the scaffold prepared at pH=2, both  HA peaks and \n\nbrushite peaks are detected. \n\nThe presence of brushite in the CH-Fibers prepared at pH 2 indicates that part of \n\nHA transformed to brushite during the scaffold preparation. Such phase transformation \n\nprobably occurred via partial dissolution of HA fibers in the acidic conditions (pH=2) of \n\nchitosan solution followed by brushite. This partial dissolution/recrystalization of HA \n\nfibers may also explain why less and smaller fibers are detected on the pore walls of the \n\nscaffolds prepared at pH 2 as compared to pH 5 (Figure 5-12 d and e)). A phase \n\ntransformation was also observed on CH-incipient monetite scaffolds prepared at \n\npH=5.Monetite was seen to transform into HA as shown in Figure 5-15 E.

Mechanical Properties \nIn the case of composite scaffolds to be used as support for bone regeneration, the \n\nimprovement of mechanical properties while ensuring an adequate microstructure with \n\nsufficient large pores for vascularization and tissue ingrowth is a critical issue. It is known \n\nthat the type of reinforcement together with the processing variables may influence the \n\npore structure and porosity and hence the mechanical response of the scaffold. Concerning \n\nthe particles used as reinforcement, depending on their geometry, they may also affect \n\ndifferently the porosity66 and pore orientation67 and thus the mechanical properties. To \n\nexploit the simultaneous effects of these experimental variables, different processing \n\nconditions (pH and freezing temperature) and different CaP loading were selected for the \n\npresent study. \n\nFigure 5-16 shows the stress-strain curves of various scaffolds, including CH and \nCaP loaded CH scaffolds. The stress-strain curves evidence two main regions: (1) initial \nlinear loading regime denoting an elastic behavior and (2) a plateau region which refers to \nthe collapse or cell wall buckle10. Two main properties may be calculated from these \ncurves: the compressive modulus \u2013 from the initial linear behavior and the compressive-\nstrength \u2013 as the highest point which is taken from the intersection between linear behavior \nand plateau region. It is generally shown that (1) loading the chitosan matrix with calcium \nphosphate particles resulted in higher mechanical property; (2) the type of reinforcement \nalso affected the scaffolds mechanical properties and (3) the CH-fibers composite scaffolds \nprepared at pH 2 (-15\u00baC) exhibited the highest compressive modulus and strength. \n\n \n\nFigure 5-16 Mechanical Properties of CH and CH composite scaffold \n\n\n\n \n\nTable 5-5 List of Scaffold Mechanical Properties (M: modulus; S: strength\n\n pH 2 pH 2 loaded\n HA \n\nFibers \n\n-196oC - - \n\n-15oC M=0.2 \nS=0.02 \n\nM= 2.58\u00b10.34\nS= 0.158\u00b10.022\n\n0C - - \n\n \n\nTable 5-5 summarizes the\n\nthe strength of the various CH and CH composite scaffolds prepared at different \n\nconditions.

It is also thought that this fact may have favored a \n\nstronger bonding between the recrystallized particles and the polymer matrix thus \n\ncontributing for mechanical properties enhancement too. It has been reported that the \n\ninteraction between the reinforcement particles and the matrix is crucial for load transfer \n\nbetween the two phases as a lack of adhesion between them results in early failure/low \n\nmechanical properties16. Reinforcing chitosan polymer with HA particles under two \n\ndifferent pH conditions may affect differently the chemical bonding between the matrix \n\nand the CaP particles as chitosan cationic groups may effectively condition the bonding \n\nstrength between the two phases. \n\nThe results of Figure 5-16 also evidence that the freezing temperature during TIPS \n\nalso affected the scaffolds mechanical properties. Comparing the HA fiber loaded \n\nscaffolds (pH5) frozen at different temperatures, i.e. -15\u00baC and 196\u00baC, an improvement of \n\ncompression strength accompanied by a decrease of  compression modulus is observed for \n\nthe scaffold quenched in liquid nitrogen temperature. The reasons underlying this behavior \n\nare not completely clear. Probably, taking into account the results from SEM and \u00b5 -CT \n\nanalysis (Figure 5-13 and Figure 5-12), it can be considered that close pores and thicker \n\nwall of pores (Figure 5-11) might be important reasons accounting for this phenomenon, in \n\nline with the findings of Yu et al.70  .  \n\nTwo types of reinforcements were used aiming to improve mechanical properties. \n\nA pH 5 CH solution was used in order to avoid CaP dissolution. Different values of \n\nmechanical properties were measured for scaffolds loaded with HA fibre, incipient \n\nmonetite and mixture of HA fibers and incipient monetite (HA: monetite = 3 : 2).The \n\nresults show  that the incipient monetite powder and its mixture with HA fibers loading \n\nenabled higher compressive strength compared to CH-fibers. As pointed out before, \n\nproperties of a composite depend on several variables such as reinforcement size, size \n\ndistribution and shape. It has been reported that irregular shape is preferred to spherical \n\nshape since it can form better interfacial bonding with the polymer62. Figure 5-12 (a and f) \n\nshows the two type of reinforcements which were used: HA fibers and incipient monetite \n\npowder. It is here suggested that the better mechanical properties achieved with the \n\nmixture of HA fibers and incipient monetite powder compared to the reinforcement \n\nprovided by HA fibers alone may be due to the irregular and non-smooth surfaces of \n\nincipient monetite powders which may favor a better connection between these particles \n\nand the polymer itself. The fibers flat surfaces are thought to ensure a lower mechanical \n\ninterlock with the polymer as compared with monetite particles. \n\n\n\n \n\n5.2.3.

It is observed that for \n\nCH-fibers composite scaffolds, the SBF solutions depletions increase with the immersion \n\ntime whereas they are not significant in the case of pure CH scaffolds. In the case of the \n\ncomposite scaffolds, the CH-fibers/pH 2 scaffold showed to promote a larger depletion of \n\nSBF P ions as compared to CH-fibers/pH 5.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Results &amp; Discussions \n\n \n\n \n\n68 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-24 Variations on Ca and P concentrations decrease (C0-Ct) of the immersion media after 0, 7, \n\n14, and 21 days \n\n \n\nThe decrease of SBF Ca and P concentrations indicate that these ions were \n\nwithdrawn from SBF solutions in the case of the composite scaffolds and precipitate on the \n\nscaffold pore walls as a CaP phase. For pure CH scaffolds the concentration of both Ca \n\nand P are relatively stable with negligible variations. Comparing the values of both ?Ca \n\nand ?P of composite scaffolds (CH-fibers/pH 2 and CH-fibers/pH 5) and pure CH, the \n\nbioactivities of the scaffolds under analysis may be ordered as CH-fibers/pH 2> CH-\n\nfibers/pH 5> pure CH. This result is in line with XRD and FTIR spectra, in which HA \n\npeaks and phosphate stretching bands are sharper in CH-fibers/pH 2, followed by  CH-\n\nfibers/pH 5, and then by pure CH.  \n\nBioactivity qualifies the tendency of a material to form a chemical bond with the \n\nhost bone16 and is experimentally denounced by the formation of an apatite layer. The \n\nprecipitation of such CaP layer requires nucleation sites for apatite nuclei to be formed and \n\nlater start growing. CH composite scaffold/pH 2 present a smaller sized porous structure as \n\ncompared to the one prepared at pH 5. Moreover it was shown that the crystalinity and \n\ncrystal phase compositions of the CaP reinforcement (Figure 5-22) is different from that of \n\nthe composite scaffold/pH5.  \n\nThe studies on apatite nucleation in biomaterials have revealed that there are a \n\nnumber of different mechanisms depending on the materials22. For bioglass and glass \n\nceramics which are based on the Na2O\u2013SiO2 or CaO\u2013SiO2 binary system, the SiOH \n\nfunctional group favors the apatite nucleation. In the case of HA, Kokubo et al.22 studied \n\nthe mechanism of apatite formation by monitoring the zeta potential prior to immersion in \n\nSBF. It was shown that in the early time, HA became negatively charged due to its OH- \n\nand PO4\n3- groups. Because of this negative charge, Ca2+ from SBF were combined with \n\nHA thus formed Ca-rich calcium phosphate which accumulated and allowed a final \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Results &amp; Discussions \n\n \n\n \n\n69 \n\n \n\npositive charge. Further process was combination of PO4\n3- to the existing Ca-rich calcium \n\nphosphate to lower the Ca/P ratio until reaching the stoichiometric ratio of HA. \n\nThe above mechanism may explain a different stabilization tendency of Ca \n\nconcentration as compared to P concentration. This tendency is clearly shown in CH-\n\nfibers/pH 2 scaffolds (Figure 5-24) as the Ca depletion curve started to stabilize after 14 \n\ndays while the P depletion curve still showed an increasing trend until 21 days. Smaller or \n\nslower depletions of both Ca and P were observed for CH-fibers/pH 5 during the first two \n\nweeks. However after that initial period certain acceleration is noticed in both ions \n\ndepletion. It is here suggested that the pore walls collapse illustrated in Figure 5-21(d) \n\nmight have contributed for an enhancement of Ca and P removal from SBF solution. These \n\nresults also indicate that CH-fibers/pH 2 promote faster Ca and P SBF ions consumption. \n\nHowever this tendency may be altered by polymer degradation which seems to start earlier \n\nfor scaffolds prepared from CH solutions pH5.    \n\nBesides their different stabilization tendencies of Ca and P SBF concentration, it is \n\nalso evident that depending on the CH solution pH, pH 2 and pH 5, different ?Ca/?P are \n\nobserved. In CH-fibers/pH 2, the ?Ca/?P value after 21 days is close to 1.85 (?wt /?wt) \n\nor 1.4 (?mol/?mol) while in CH-fibers/pH 5 is close to 3.90(?wt/?wt) or to 2.9 \n\n(?mol/?mol). These values also qualify the bioactivity difference between the scaffolds \n\nprepared at different pH, as already confirmed by XRD and FTIR (Figure 5-22 and Figure \n\n5-23). In CH-fibers/pH 2, the value of ?Ca/?P (1.4) is below the ratio of stoichiometric  \n\nHAs (Ca/P= 1.6-1.7) while in CH-fibers/pH 5, the value of ?Ca/?P (2.90) indicates a \n\ndifferent bioactivity in which the process of P absorption is delayed. The obtained curves \n\nanticipate that longer times will be required for CH-fibers/pH 5 if a value ?Ca/?P \n\napproaching that of stoichiometric HA is desired.  \n\nIn the case of CH-fibers/pH 2, the as prepared scaffold contains brushite (XRD in \n\nFigure 5-15 A). After 21 days of SBF immersion (XRD in Figure 5-22 A), the peak of \n\nbrushite has disappeared thus indicating that its dissolution and possible recrystallization \n\nas a different CaP type. It is known that acidic CaP, like brushite, is not stable at pH values \n\nabove 6. This reason explains why in SBF (pH ~7), brushite transforms into a more stable \n\nCaP72. Zhang and Zhang10 studied the bioactivity of ?-TCP and glass reinforced chitosan \n\ncomposite scaffold and monitored the variations of Ca and P concentration during the first \n\nday prior to immersion. The results revealed that Ca and P concentrations increased due to \n\ndissolution of glass and ?-TCP occurred during the first 20hours. Further observation \n\nshowed the Ca and P concentrations decreased which indicated the formation of apatitic \n\nlayer in the scaffold. \n\nAs explained before, preparing the scaffolds at pH 2 turned out to dissolve some \n\namount of HA fibers giving place to brushite precipitation during the later freezing step. \n\n(section 5.2.2.). The existing brushite in the scaffold CH-fibers/pH 2 underwent dissolution \n\nand precipitation during SBF immersion. The CaP re-precipitation will originate smaller \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Results &amp; Discussions \n\n \n\n \n\n70 \n\n \n\nparticles as compared to the original HA fibers. Compared to CH-fibers/pH 5, in which \n\nonly HA fibers (in the size of 50-200\u00b5m) are present in the scaffold, the existence of other \n\nsmaller sized precipitates in CH-fibers/pH 2 is though to offer more nucleation sites for \n\napatite formation. As mentioned by Alves et al.73, smaller sized bioactive particles which \n\nreinforce in the composite enhance osteoblast proliferation and differentiation and thus \n\nfurther enhance biomineralization process.       \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Results &amp; Discussions \n\n \n\n \n\n71 \n\n \n\n5.3.Drug-Loaded Composite Scaffold \n \n\nA study of the chitosan based scaffolds prepared in this work for the application of \n\ndrug delivery system was carried out.

However, for \n\nlonger release time, the scaffold prepared by procedure 1 showed the faster release in \n\nwhich after 2 days, the release curve started to stabilize. For procedures 2 and 3, the drug \n\nrelease seems to be rather delayed , being the release pattern of procedure 3 a more \n\nretarded one (Figure 5-28 A).   \n\n \nFigure 5-29 Higher amplification for shorter release time from Figure 5-28 A \n\nThe drug delivery profile from any delivery system depends on several factors: (1) \n\nthe microstructure of the system, (2) the drug solubility, (3) the type of bond between the \n\ndrug and the matrix, and (4) the mechanism of degradability of the matrix (if existing)77. \n\nFrom the point of view of polymer carriers, three main possible mechanisms are available \n\nfor drug deliver: diffusion controlled, solvent-activation (swelling-osmotically controlled) \n\nand controlled by biodegradability (chemically-controlled)78. In the present study, the \n\nscaffolds were seen to degrade superficially (Figure 5-26 (b)). This indicates that besides \n\ndiffusion, the biodegradability of the chitosan scaffold will be also contributing to the drug \n\ndelivery. \n\nIn the procedure 1, the initial burst release accounts for almost all the released \n\ndrug. As the drug was dissolved directly in the composite suspension (CH + HA \n\nmicrospheres), most of the drug remained probably located in polymer matrix sites with \n\neasy access to the release medium. Conversely, using DEX-HA loaded granules \n\n(procedure 2 or 3) resulted in a less accessible location of the drug to the release medium. \n\nThe drug loaded into the granules has now to diffuse through the granules and then \n\nthrough the polymer matrix before reaching the release medium. It can thus be considered \n\nthat the closer to polymer matrix surface, the faster is the release. This is supposed to be \n\nthe case of procedure 1 which showed the fastest drug release, with  approximately ~80% \n\nof the DEX being released in less than 2days.  \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Results &amp; Discussions \n\n \n\n \n\n75 \n\n \n\nFurthermore the initial burst release during the first few hours exhibited by all the \n\nscaffolds indicates that all scaffolds possess a certain amount of drug located in the near \n\nsurface region, including the scaffold prepared by procedure 2. For this one, even though \n\nthe drug was loaded only into the HA granules, there is a probability that a certain amount \n\nof DEX diffused to the chitosan solution before freeze drying and then precipitated within \n\nthe polymer matrix during freezing. Such behavior indeed decreased the effectiveness of \n\ndrug loading into HA granules.  Regarding the procedure 3, the addition of a certain \n\namount of DEX to the chitosan solution decreases DEX concentration gradients  \n\nthroughout the whole system and thus minimizes the DEX diffusion out from the HA \n\ngranules into the chitosan solution. By applying this method, the DEX concentration inside \n\nthe HA granules is likely maintained and the diffusion from granules to chitosan solution \n\nminimized. This is confirmed by the curves in figure 5-27 (B) which show that the initial \n\nburst release in procedure 1 and 3 are essentially the same. This initial burst reflects the \n\ndelivery of equivalent amounts of DEX existing within the polymer matrix which \n\ncorrespond to the same M mg of DEX dissolved in the CH solutions of both cases.  \n\nCompared to procedure 1, both procedures 2 and 3 show the ability to retard the \n\ndrug release. The scaffold prepared using procedure 2 showed an initial burst drug release \n\nof about ~45% of the total loaded drug during the first 12 hours (Figure 5-29), followed by \n\na slower release until 80% during the remaining 30days (Figure 5-28 (A)). The results also \n\nshow that preparing the composite scaffolds by procedure 3,i.e. by adding an extra amount \n\nof DEX to the CH solution, allowed to reduce the initial burst release to ~30%, thus \n\nenabling a larger amount of DEX to be released slower during the remaining period. This \n\nfact demonstrates that the drug initially added to the chitosan solution succeeded to keep \n\nthe drug confined to the granules during the initial period of drug release thus slowing \n\ndown the overall release rate.  \n\nFitting the initial burst release to Fickian diffusional release equation of the type:  \n\n   \n??\n\n??\n\n= ??\n?       (5.3) \n\nwhere ?? is the amount of DEX released at t time, ??is the total released amount \n\nat infinite time, t is the release time, k is a constant, and n is the diffusional exponent, it \n\nwas observed that the initial burst release data corresponding to the release time ~10hours \n\nfit well the equation. The value obtained for n was close to ~0.42. This value of n is close \n\nto n = 0.5, which indicates a diffusion controlled release74, 79. It is thus suggested that \n\ndiffusion controlled drug release occurs in all the prepared scaffolds during the initial \n\nrelease periods. Further studies are required to explain the mechanism applying to longer \n\nrelease times. \n\nThe drug loading methods of chitosan scaffolds used in the present work improved \n\nthe DEX sustained release ability. Duarte et al.80 prepared chitosan scaffold loaded with \n\ndexamethasone using supercritical impregnation, and the result showed that almost 90% of \n\n\n\nChapter 5: Results &amp; Discussions \n\n \n\n \n\n76 \n\n \n\nthe loaded drug was released after 2 hours. Chitosan composite scaffold with ?-TCP and \n\nglass which were loaded by gentamicin sulphate via 48h of soaking showed initial burst \n\nreleasing ~80% of the drug during 2 days and followed by slower release until ~20days7. \n\nComparing with these two methods, it is worthy to mention the advantages of loading the \n\ndrug into HA microspheres and further inserted them into the chitosan solution before \n\nfreeze-drying (both procedure 2 and 3).  The results pointed out that those scaffolds were \n\nable to retard the drug release evidencing a sustained release profile of DEX, thus \n\nsuggesting their potential to be used as controlled drug release system. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6: Conclusions &amp; Recommendations \n\n \n\n \n\n77 \n\n \n\nChapter 6  \nConclusions &amp; Recommendations \n\n \nA comprehensive study on chitosan based scaffolds for bone regeneration has been \n\ncarried out in the present work. Different types of chitosan based scaffolds were prepared \n\nwith different composition and under different conditions. HA fibers and monetite thin \n\nplatelets were obtained by a precipitation method. These two types of CaP particles as well as \n\na mixture of them were used as reinforcing elements of chitosan scaffolds. HA granules \n\n(loaded or unloaded with DEX) prepared by spray-drying were also used to load the scaffolds \n\nwith DEX. Microstructure characteristics (pore size, porosity and interconnectivity), crystal \n\nphase composition, mechanical properties, bioactivity, and drug delivery performance of the \n\nproduced scaffolds were studied.  \n\n \n\nCaP particles precipitation \n\nHA fibers with a size in the range of 50-150\u00b5m were successfully produced by a \n\nprecipitation method reported by Aizawa et al.38 and Zhang et al.39, in moderately acidic \n\nsolution. Three main stages were identified in the precipitation (1) formation of platelet \n\nshaped monetite, (2) formation of fibers-like OCP, and (3) transformation of fibers-like OCP \n\ncrystal into HA. The fiber morphology was defined in the first 24 hours of refluxing at 80\u00baC \n\nwhile increasing refluxing temperature to 90\u00baC ensured the transformation of OCP into HA. \n\nIt was also demonstrated that modifying Zhang method by anticipating the 90\u00baC refluxing \n\ndoes enable to reduce the time required for obtaining HA fibers.  \n\n \n\nChitosan based Scaffolds \n\nHighly interconnected macroporous scaffolds with pore sizes in the range of 50-\n\n300\u00b5m, interconnectivity around 91-98.5%, and porosity higher than 80% were produced by \n\nfreeze-drying. Three dimensional chitosan based scaffold loaded either with HA fibers, or \n\nwith monetite platelets or a mixture of both were characterized in terms of microstructure, \n\ncrystal phase composition, mechanical and bioactive behaviors and compared to pure \n\nchitosan scaffold. The pH of chitosan solution, the freezing temperature during TIPS and the \n\ntype of loaded calcium phosphate particle were confirmed to have a significant influence in \n\nthe properties of the obtained scaffolds. These variables showed to play an important role in \n\ndefining the scaffold microstructure. Larger pores were normally obtained when using higher \n\nfreezing temperature, higher pH CH solutions and by HA fibers loading (pH 5).  \n\nThe mechanical properties of the scaffolds were seen to be highly dependent on pore \n\nsize and on the type of reinforcement.  Low pH values and freezing temperatures resulted in \n\nscaffolds of smaller pore and hence with better mechanical properties. Conversely, high pH \n\nvalue and freezing temperature resulted in larger pore but lower mechanical properties. The \n\nmorphology of the reinforcing-particles was also a critical variable. Monetite thin platelets \n\ndisplayed a better reinforcing ability as compared to HA fibers, being this effect attributed to \n\n\n\nChapter 6: Conclusions &amp; Recommendations \n\n \n\n \n\n78 \n\n \n\nthe irregular and smaller sized platelet shape which allowed a better bonding with polymer \n\nmatrix. From the point of view of bioactivity, chitosan composite scaffold loaded with HA \n\nfibers exhibited enhanced bioactive response as compared to pure chitosan. Continuous \n\nvariation of Ca and P concentrations in SBF solution during scaffolds soaking indicated \n\ndeposition of apatite layer in the materials. This behavior was not observed in pure chitosan \n\nscaffold. \n\nSome experimental conditions combinations were found appropriated for obtaining \n\nscaffolds which porosity, pore size, interconnectivity and mechanical properties point out a  \n\npotential applicability in bone tissue engineering, CH-fibers/pH 2 frozen at -15oC \n\ndemonstrated the best bioactivity and mechanical properties (compressive modulus: \n\n2.58Mpa, compressive strength: 0.18Mpa) while displaying an average pore size of ~136\u00b5m.  \n\nOther produced scaffolds were found to have larger pore sizes such as CH-fibers/pH 5 frozen \n\nat -15oC (~152\u00b5m) and CH-fibers/pH 5 frozen at -196oC (~190\u00b5m) but lower mechanical \n\nproperties. CH-monetite/pH 5 frozen at 0oC showing the second best mechanical properties \n\n(compressive modulus: 0.7-0.87Mpa, compressive strength: 0.07-0.11Mpa) with an average \n\npore size (~170\u00b5m) is also worthy mentioning. These pore size values are already close to the \n\nsize required (200-400\u00b5m) for good cell proliferation. However, from the point of view of \n\nmechanical properties, the obtained scaffolds still need to be improved. \n\n \n\nChitosan based Scaffolds DDS \n\nLoading dexamethasone as a drug model into HA granules and inserted them further \n\nin chitosan scaffold was proved to be a good strategy to retard the drug release. Three \n\ndifferent methodologies of drug loading into to the scaffolds were confirmed to affect \n\nsignificantly the drug release rate. Immobilizing the drug in HA granules by spray drying \n\nbefore combining with the chitosan solution demonstrated slower release as compared to \n\nmixing directly the drug with the CH solution. An even slower release rate could be obtained \n\nby adding DEX to the chitosan solution in order to minimize DEX concentration gradients: \n\n25% of DEX was released during the first 14hours being followed by a slow release of DEX \n\nuntil 80% during the remaining 30days.  This method showed to provide a slower release rate \n\nas compared to other reports   \n\n \n\nThis study underscores the chitosan based scaffold as a potential scaffold for bone \n\nregeneration and drug delivery system.  \n\n \n\nRecommendations for Future Work \nThe results obtained in the present work revealed some needs of further studies \n\naiming to clarify the following issues: \n\n1. Freezing temperature during TIPS was shown to be a critical variable for determining  the \npore structure which in turns determines the mechanical properties. However freezing at -\n\n196\u00baC is though to have a potential for pore orientation which was not exploited in the \n\n\n\nChapter 6: Conclusions &amp; Recommendations \n\n \n\n \n\n79 \n\n \n\npresent work. It is thus suggested to test sufficiently low freezing temperatures combined \n\nwith different freezing methologies for exploiting the method potentialities for pore \n\nalignment. \n\n2. The effects of increasing loads of CaP particles in CH scaffolds need to be investigated \nfor assessing its effect on both the scaffold pore size and mechanical properties. \n\n3. Drug release studies with various drug concentrations should be undertaken for assessing \nthe active mechanisms during drug release for longer times, It is expected that such \n\nstudies might contribute to identify the scaffold parameters that rule DEX release.   \n\n4. Biocompatibility test (cell culture tests) should be carried out in order to study the cell \nresponse (attachment and or proliferation).dependence on the scaffolds characteristics.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n80 \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n                                                             \n1 Kim, I.-Y. et al.
