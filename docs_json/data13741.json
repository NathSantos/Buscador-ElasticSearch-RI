In the western Atlantic \nOcean, wreckfish are found from about 45\"N to \n45\"s. The wreckfish is a large demersal species, \nand adults in the western North Atlantic are \n\nknown only from rocky bottom and coral \npinnacles on the Blake Plateau and Great and \n\nLittle Bahama Banks, in depths from 450 to 600 \n\nm (SEDBERRY et al. 1994; SEDBERRY et al. 1996). \nSpawning occurs on the Blake Plateau, primarily \n\nin February and March (D. Wyanski pers. comm.). \nWhile large demersal wreckfish have a limited \ndistribution in the western Atlantic, pelagic \n\njuveniles are found north of Cape Hatteras, and \ninto Canadian waters, and are abundant in the \neastern North Atlantic. Juvenile wreckfish live at \nthe surface to a length of at least 30 cm, where \n\nthey associate with floating objects (ROBERTS \n1989). Wreckfish are recruited to the Blake \n\nPlateau at age four, which corresponds to a mean \n\n\n\ntotal length of 68 cm (G. SEDBERRY et al. \nunpubl.). Wreckfish smaller than 65 cm total \nlength have not been observed in fishery \n\nlandings, by research vessel, or from submersible \non the Blake Plateau, and fish less than 85 cm \nare very rare there (SEDBERRY et al. 1996). \n\nThe fishery for wreckfish in the southeastern \nUnited States developed in the mid-1980s, and \nthe species formerly had been considered rare in \nthe western North Atlantic (ROBINS &amp; RAY \n1986). Because of its perceived rarity and very \nspecific habitat requirements, the wreckfish has \nbeen managed conservatively. SEDBERRY et al. \n(1994) reviewed development of the fishery from \nits establishment through the first management \nplans. Management measures in the U.S. now \ninclude a total allowable catch, individual \ntransferable quotas, gear restrictions (no \nlonglines) and a spawning season closure of the \n\nfishery. The management plan assumed a single \nstock of wreckfish in the North Atlantic, which \nhas since been confirmed with mtDNA analyses \n(SEDBERRY et al. 1996). However, little is \nknown about recruitment of wreckfish to the \nBlake Plateau fishing grounds, or when or where \npelagic juveniles from Blake Plateau spawning \ndescend to their adult benthic habitat. A single \ngenetic stock of wreckfish extends from the only \ndocumented North Atlantic spawning grounds \noff South Carolina to the Madeira archipelago \nand Mediterranean Sea (SEDBERRY et al. 1996). \nMechanisms for maintaining gene flow, and the \npatterns of recruitment of juveniles and adults \nare poorly understood, but some active adult \nmigration or drifting of pelagic juvenile phases \nmust be involved (SEDBERRY et al. 1996). \n\nAmerican wreckfish are often caught on the \nBlake Plateau fishing grounds with fish hooks, \nalready in their mouths and guts, which are of a \ntype not used by American fishermen. SEDBERRY \net al. (1996) speculated that these hooks, which \nare used by European fishermen, are acquired by \ndemersal wreckfish in the eastern Atlantic from \nbottom longlines, before migrating to the Blake \nPlateau. \n\nTo explain distribution of mtDNA haplotypes \nin the North Atlantic and to corroborate the \ncircumstantial evidence about recruitment \npatterns derived from fish hooks (SEDBERRY et \n\nal. 1996), we began tagging pelagic juvenile \nwreckfish in the eastern Atlantic, around the \nAzores and Madeira archipelagos. Here we report \nthe recapture of a tagged juvenile wreckfish. \n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS \n\nWreckfish (n=20) were tagged with nylon dart \ntags (Hallprint 146 mm) inserted with a canula \nbetween the pterygiophores of the first dorsal fin. \nFive fish were double-tagged with an internal \nanchor tag (Floy 0.5 x 1.9 cm oval anchor; 7.6 cm \n\nstreamer) in addition to the dart. Tagging took \nplace in waters adjacent to the Central Group of \nislands of the Azores archipelago (Fig. 1). Tags \nwere printed with identification numbers and the \nword \"reward\" and \"mail to\" in English, French, \nPortuguese and Spanish. The return address of the \nsenior author's laboratory was printed on the tag. \nPosters describing the tagging program and \nadvertising a reward (in the four languages) were \ndistributed among the major fishing ports in the \nAzores, Madeira, Canary islands and Majorca, \nwith instructions to contact either of the authors' \nlaboratories. The tagging program was publicised \nin the southeastern U.S. with posters and press \nreleases. \n\nEpipelagic juvenile wreckfish for tagging were \nlocated by spotting floating debris and dipnetting \nor angling fishes associated with the debris. \nTagging took place in June 1996 (n=l), and in \nApril (n=14) and July (n=5) 1997. \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nFloating objects with which wreckfish were found \nconsisted primarily of plastic debris, including \nsheeting, packaging, shopping b a g ,  buckets, jugs, \nbuoys and polypropylene line; styrofoam floats; \nsealed metal cans; glass bottles; and vegetable \nmatter such as woody plants and branches, \nlumber, and (rarely) coconuts. Juvenile wreckfish \nwere most commonly associated with floating \nplastic buckets and ,'boxes with 'some barnacle \nencrustation, and would only venture out to take \nbait when other small fish species were present. \nThese species wefe most commonly grey \ntriggerfish, Balistes capriscus; &amp;d oceanic boy \nmackerel, Trqchurus picturatus. Other species \nencountered with floating objects included \n\n\n\n\n\npompano, Trachinotus ovatus; the centrolophid \n\nSchedophilus ovalis; and pilotfish, Naucrates \n\nductor. Juvenile loggerhead turtles, Caretta \ncaretta, were often observed when looking for \n\ndebris. Occasionally, presumed predators of \n\njuvenile wreckfish (dolphin fish, Coryphaena \n\nhippurus; sharks, Isurus sp. and Sphyrna sp.) \nwere encountered beneath windrows and near \ndebris, and no wreckfish or other small fishes \n\nwere encountered when large predators were \n\npresent. \nOne wreckfish we tagged at the surface, near \n\na floating tree, in approximately 1000 m of water \n\nnear Condor de Fora Seamount, 38 krn southwest \nof Horta on Faial Island (tagging location: \n38\"22'N, 29'00'W), was later recaptured. This \n\nfish was 49.0 cm total length when tagged on 6 \nApril 1997, and it was recaptured on 9 July 1997 \nby a commercial fisherman using bottom \nlongline in 254 m depth. The specimen was \ncaught 217 km east-southeast of its release point, \n\nat a location 0.9 km east of Banco D. Jolo de \nCastro (at 38'13.6'N, 26'33.9W). The wreckfish \nweighed 2.85 kg when recaptured, which \n\nindicates a total length of 50.1 cm, according to \nthe length-weight regression provided by \n\nSEDBERRY et al. (1994). \nThe wreckfish congener Polyprion \n\noxygeneios also lives at the surface as a juvenile, \nand switches from pelagic to the demersal habitat \nat around 50 cm TL and 3-4 years old (M. \nFrancis pers. comm.). Wreckfish also apparently \ntake up the demersal habitat at about 50 cm. We \nhave not aged wreckfish this small, but data from \nP. oxygeneios suggest that these fish may be over \none year old, and theoretical and back-calculated \n\nwreckfish lengths at age indicate that these fish \n\nmay be two years old or older (G. SEDBERRY et \n\nal. unpubl). \nThis change in size and depth from tagging to \n\nrecapture is consistent with known and surmised \n\nlife history, and this is the first documentation of \nwreckfish completing a transition from the \n\nepipelagic to benthic habitat. Additional tag \n\nrecoveries should further elucidate the timing and \n\nnature of the transition for the North Atlantic \npopulation. \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nG. Ulrich and T. Gomes assisted in tagging of \n\nwreckfish. M. Sousa caught the tagged wreckfish \nand provided recapture data.
