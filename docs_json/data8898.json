GICs are usually prepared through the mixing of a fluoroaluminosilicate glass \n\npowder, polyacrylic acid (PAA) and water. The PAA attacks the glass particles that \n\nleach some of its cations (e.g. Al3+ and Ca2+) to the cement matrix. These cations \n\ncross-link the PAA chains yielding the final cement structure. GICs possess as main \n\nadvantage the ability to bind to hydroxyapatite present in the dentin and bone. These \n\nsystems have been mainly used in the dentistry field (non-systemic application). \n\nApplications that induce a systemic uptake of the cement components (e.g. bone \n\ncements) have been discarded due to the presence of aluminium (a known neurotoxin) \n\non the GIC formulations. \n\nThe present thesis targets the development of new glass-ionomer cement (GIC) \n\nformulations with potential to be applied as bone cements. To this purpose, new \n\naluminium-free glass compositions of general formula 0.340SiO2 : 0.300ZnO : (0.250-x-\n\ny)CaO : xSrO : yMgO: 0.050Na2O : 0.060P2O5 (where x and y = 0.000 or 0.125) were \n\nsynthesised and tested in the formulation of GICs through their mixing with PAA and \n\nwater. The different parameters that influence the GIC mechanical performance (e.g. \n\nglass particle size, molecular weight of PAA, proportion of the constituents, etc.) were \n\noptimized. The GIC prepared with the developed glass compositions where in vitro \n\ntested for their bioactivity. To this purpose, GIC samples were immersion in SBF and \n\ntheir ability to form a surface apatite layer was evaluated by: 1) determination of the \n\nconcentration of the calcium and phosphorous in the SBF (executed by ICP); 2) \n\nquantification of the calcium and phosphorous present at the surface of the cements \n\n(executed by EDS) and 3) morphological analysis (executed by SEM). Micro-CT was \n\nalso used to evaluate the spatial distribution of the polymeric and inorganic phases. \n\nFinally, in an attempt to enhance the GIC biodegradability it was incorporated starch in \n\nthe cement formulations, at different weight percentages (5% and 25%). \n\nThe results obtained under this thesis proved the suitability of some of the developed \n\nglass compositions (e.g. 0.34SiO2: 0.30ZnO: 0.125CaO: 0.125SrO: 0.05Na2O: \n\n0.06P2O5) to prepare GICs in accordance with its use as bone cements, including: \n\nsuitable mechanical performance (compressive strength, CS=25 MPa; compressive \n\nmodulus, CM=492 MPa) for non-load bearing applications; bioactivity; and 35 % \n\nporosity. Moreover, after the 8th week of degradation under enzymatic medium it was \n\ndetected reducing sugars in the degradation solutions of the starch-containing \n\nformulations confirming its biodegradation potential at a longer timeframe. \n\n\n\nvi \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nvii \n\n \n\nResumo \n\nO primeiro cimento de ion\u00f3mero de vidro (GIC) foi desenvolvido por Wilson e \n\nKent em 1971. Estes cimentos s\u00e3o normalmente preparados atrav\u00e9s de uma mistura \n\nde um p\u00f3 de vidro geralmente fluoroaluminosilicatos com \u00e1cido poliacrilico (PAA) e \n\n\u00e1gua. O PAA ataca as part\u00edculas de vidro que liberta alguns dos seus cati\u00f5es (e.g. Al3+ \n\ne Ca2+) para a matriz do cimento que v\u00e3o ligar-se \u00e0s cadeias do PAA. Os cimentos \n\npossuem como vantagens a capacidade para se ligarem \u00e0 hidroxiapatite presente nos \n\ndentes e ossos. Estes sistemas t\u00eam sido usados principalmente na \u00e1rea dent\u00e1ria \n\n(aplica\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o sist\u00e9micas). Aplica\u00e7\u00f5es que induzem uma absor\u00e7\u00e3o sist\u00e9mica dos \n\ncomponentes do cimento t\u00eam sido rejeitadas devido \u00e0 presen\u00e7a de alum\u00ednio (uma \n\nneurotoxina conhecida). \n\n A presente tese tem como principal objetivo o desenvolvimento de novas \n\nformula\u00e7\u00f5es de cimentos de ion\u00f3mero de vidro para aplica\u00e7\u00e3o como cimentos \u00f3sseos. \n\nPara este prop\u00f3sito, foram sintetizadas novas composi\u00e7\u00f5es de vidros sem alum\u00ednio \n\ncom a f\u00f3rmula geral 0.340SiO2: 0.300ZnO: (0.250-x-y)CaO: xSrO: yMgO: 0.050Na2O: \n\n0.060P2O5 (onde x e y = 0.000 ou 0.125) e utilizadas na formula\u00e7\u00e3o de cimentos \n\natrav\u00e9s da mistura com PAA e \u00e1gua. Os par\u00e2metros que influenciam a performance \n\nmec\u00e2nica dos cimentos (e.g. tamanho de part\u00edcula, peso molecular do PAA, propor\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndos constituintes, etc.) foram otimizados. Os cimentos foram analisados in vitro para \n\nobter informa\u00e7\u00e3o acerca da sua bioactividade. Para este estudo, amostras de cimentos \n\nforam imersas em SBF e a sua capacidade de formar uma superf\u00edcie de apatite foi \n\navaliada atrav\u00e9s da: 1) determina\u00e7\u00e3o da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de c\u00e1lcio e f\u00f3sforo presente em \n\nSBF (efetuado por ICP); 2) quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o de c\u00e1lcio e f\u00f3sforo presente na superf\u00edcie dos \n\ncimentos (efetuado por EDS); 3) an\u00e1lise morfol\u00f3gica (efetuado por SEM). Micro-CT foi \n\nutilizado para avaliar a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de fases polim\u00e9ricas e inorg\u00e2nicas. Finalmente, \n\npara obten\u00e7\u00e3o de cimentos biodegrad\u00e1veis foi incorporado amido na sua formula\u00e7\u00e3o, \n\ncom diferentes percentagens (5% e 25%). \n\nOs resultados obtidos nesta tese demonstraram a possibilidade de algumas \n\ncomposi\u00e7\u00f5es de vidro (e.g. 0.340SiO2: 0.300ZnO: 0.125CaO: 0.125SrO: 0.050Na2O: \n\n0.060P2O5) contribu\u00edrem para a prepara\u00e7\u00e3o de cimentos com interesse para aplica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ncomo cimentos \u00f3sseos, incluindo uma adequada performance mec\u00e2nica (Compressive \n\nstrength, CS= 25 MPa; Compressive modulus, CM= 492 MPa) para zonas de carga \n\nn\u00e3o permanente, bioactividade e 35 % de porosidade. Al\u00e9m disso, ap\u00f3s a oitava \n\nsemana de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o em condi\u00e7\u00f5es enzim\u00e1ticas foram detetados a\u00e7\u00facares \n\nredutores nas formula\u00e7\u00f5es contendo amido confirmando o seu potencial de \n\nbiodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\n\n\nviii \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nix \n\n \n\nIndex Index Index Index     \n\nAcknowledgments iv \n\nAbstract v \n\nResumo vii \n\nList of Abbreviations xiii \n\nList of Figures xv \n\nList of Tables xvii \n\n \n\nChapter I: General Introduction \n \n\n1.

General remarks \nThis thesis addresses developments and optimizations on glass-ionomer \n\ncements (GICs) targeting their application in the repair of bone. Under this \n\nperspective, this introductory chapter will comprise an initial section that \n\nincludes a series of considerations on the bone tissue, namely, its structure, \n\nproperties, repair steps and self-regeneration. Afterwards, it will be presented a \n\nsection on the biomaterials relevant to the bone regeneration and repair, \n\nnamely, the inorganic-based bone cements - the group of materials that present \n\nproperties and characteristics more similar to the system under study. This \n\nsection also includes relevant concepts in the biomedical field, such as, \n\nbiodegradability and bioactivity. Finally, a third section will focus on the GIC \n\nsystem, its components, curing reactions, properties, applications, advantages \n\nand disadvantages. \n\n2. Bone regeneration/treatment \n\n2.1 Bone \u2013 What is it? \nBone is one of the main constituents of the skeleton that acts as a \n\nsupport structure for the vertebrates. In the materials point of view, it has been \n\nconsidered as a heterogeneous bioceramic composite exhibiting variations on \n\nits chemical composition in between species. In fact the most noted differences \n\nin its mineral constitution are observed between two types of bones: rat and fish \n\nbone. It was also detected differentiated chemical composition in the skeletons \n\nof the hamster, monkey, pig, man and other vertebrates [1-5]. \n\nIn order to better understand the relationships between bone chemical \n\ncomposition and its properties it is relevant to understand the mechanisms \n\ninvolved in bone related chemical processes, e.g. chemistry of calcification, \n\nbone as an ion reservoir, among others. Biltz and co-workers also concluded \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nthat bone possesses chemical differences that are dependent on the age, \n\nexerted strength, metabolic activity and sex of the individual. Depending on \n\nthese factors, it is observed a variation on the quantity of water and organic \n\ncomponents present in the bone. In this perspective, it was also established a \n\nrelationship between the bone water content and its degree of mineralization \n\n[3]. \n\nEach individual presents different types of bone within the body. The main \n\ndifferences are related with its density, from a more compact structure (cortical \n\nbone) to a less dense material (cancellous bone). Based in the study of the \n\nbone individual components it was concluded that its main properties (stiffness, \n\nelasticity, hardness and toughness) are derived from their combination in an \n\nheterogeneous structure [1]. It is also known that systematic loading affects \n\nbone mass and size. This is one of the reasons for the observed variations on \n\nbone density with the age of the individual [5]. \n\n2.2 Constitution of bone \n\nBone is a metabolically active tissue composed by a mineral and an organic \n\nphase that contribute to two thirds and one third of its weight, respectively [4]. \n\nAs shown in Figure 1 the bone exhibits a structure that has elements of several \n\nlength scales and which, together, perform various mechanical, chemical and \n\nbiological functions, e.g. it acts as a support structure, reservoir of mineral ions, \n\namong others [6] \n\n \n\nFigure 1: Hierarchical structural organization of bone. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nHas stated before, bone is a heterogeneous bioceramic that combines an \n\ninorganic with an organic phase. In terms of its chemical composition, its main \n\ncomponent is in the inorganic phase: carbonated hydroxyapatite (60-70 % w/w) \n\nof low crystallinity. The organic phase is mainly composed by fibrils of Type I \n\ncollagen, although, other components are present, namely: growth factors and \n\nglycosaminoglycans. Finally, approximately 10 % of bone is composed by water \n\n[2]. \n\nThe different types of bones (e.g. cortical or cancellous) are histologically \n\ndifferent, although, their chemical composition is similar. Cortical bone \n\nrepresents, approximately, 80 % of the skeleton. It is dense and compact and \n\npossesses a high resistance to bending. Most of this type of bone is calcified \n\nand its main function is mechanical support and protection. Cancellous bone \n\nrepresents 20 % of skeletal mass and, approximately, 80% is found at the ends \n\nof long bones and in the interior of the vertebrae and pelvis. It is less dense, \n\nmore elastic, and has a higher turnover rate than compact bone [7]. \n\nBone is also constituted by cells. In fact there are three main types of cells in \n\nthe bone tissue: osteoblasts, osteocytes and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts are the \n\ncells responsible for synthesis and deposition of minerals and, therefore, the \n\nmineralization of bone extracellular matrix. During their activity osteoblasts can \n\nbecome isolated in a cavity surrounded by bone matrix as a result of the \n\ndeposition of minerals. Under these circumstances they differentiate into \n\nosteocytes, one of the most abundant types of cell in bone. Finally, osteoclasts \n\nare responsible for the bone remodelling process and their principal function is \n\nto resorb mineralized bone [8]. \n\n2.3 Mechanical properties of bone \n\nIn the context of mechanical evaluation it is relevant to describe the \n\ndifferent data that can be extracted from the uniaxial mechanical tests. In this \n\nperspective, Figure 2 presents a stress-strain curve obtained from a mechanical \n\ntest. The curve is the result of applied stress and the following data can be \n\ncollected [1]: \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\u2022 Beginning of the elastic behaviour; \n\n\u2022 Elastic range; \n\n\u2022 Range of plastic deformation; \n\n\u2022 Breaking point; \n\n\u2022 Amount of energy absorbed by the material; \n\n\u2022 Elastic modulus (measuring the slope at the elastic range).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2: Stages of mechanical deformation: the elastic range (E), the continuum \n\ndamage mechanics range (CDM) and the fracture mechanics (FM). \n\nThe mechanical behaviour of a material can be divided in three phases (I, II and \n\nIII). Under I (the elastic regime) the material deforms reversibly and only \n\nresidual damage occurs. Phase II corresponds to the plastic regime where the \n\nmaterial absorbs enough energy to develop microcracks. In phase III it occur \n\nmechanical failure and the amount of energy that the material is able to absorb \n\nreduces drastically. \n\nUnder mechanical loading, the bone can suffer of different types of ageing that \n\ncan lead to fractures. These ageing mechanisms can be derived from creep \n\n(with prolonged load) or fatigue (repetitive) [9]. It has become recently clear that \n\nbone and other biological hard tissues show weak interlamellar interfaces, \n\nwhich are able to absorb energy and/or divert a crack. In this way, bone has a \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nlimited capacity to detain the onset and growth of fracture. Furthermore, it is \n\nnow increasingly clear that initiation of cracks in biomineralized tissues is far \n\nless important than their propagation since biological tissues use a number of \n\nprocesses (e.g. crack diversion/deflection, fibre pull-out, crack and/or matrix \n\nbridging) to increase the required amount of energy for fracture to occur [9]. \n\nThe mechanical behaviour of bone depends on its type (cortical or cancellous). \n\nAdditionally, as with any biological sample its variability is significant \n\nrepresenting a reasonably large interval of expectable values. Table 1 resumes \n\nthe most relevant mechanical properties of the two main types of bone. \n\n \n\nTable 1: Mechanical properties of cortical and cancellous bone [10]. \n\nProperty Cortical bone Cancellous bone \n\nCompressive strength (MPa) 100-230 2-12 \n\nFlexural, tensile strength (MPa) 50-150 10-20 \n\nStrain to failure (%) 1-3 5-7 \n\nYoung\u2019s (tensile) modulus (GPa) 7-30 0.5-0.05 \n\n \n\n2.4 Bone repair \n\nWhen the ends of fractured bone are held in place, there are two types of \n\nprimary mineralized tissue healing that can occur: gap repair and contact repair. \n\nIn gap repair, healing begins by the formation of blood vessels and connective \n\ntissue fills the empty spaces. After 2 weeks osteoblasts fill the gaps in the tissue \n\nby secreting osteoid. Upon 10 more days osteoids became mineralized and the \n\nosteoblasts that remained in the matrix become entrapped. The new bone acts \n\nas a scaffold for remodelling promoted by osteoclasts and osteoblasts. In \n\ncontact repair, there is no gap between the bone ends, although, necrotic bone \n\nmust be removed before new bone can be deposited to repair the fracture. \n\nOsteoclasts are responsible to resorb the necrotic bone. Afterwards, \n\nosteoblasts attach to the tissue matrix, creating a ruffled cell border between the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\ncell and the bone surface promoting mineralization of the bone and subsequent \n\nre-linking of the bone surfaces. \n\nIn bone repair, secondary healing occurs when bones are not rigidly supported \n\nafter the injury. The first step is to create an ECM-rich bridge to support the \n\nfracture and the unstabilized mineralized tissue will undergo secondary repair. \n\nMost compact bone surfaces that make up the outer layer are covered by \n\nosteoblasts that promote mineralization. The wound site will re-gain some \n\nmechanical strength after 4 days of healing (Figure 3 (a)). \n\n \n\n  \n\n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 3: (a) Primary and secondary mineralized tissue repair; (b) Primary and \n\nsecondary bone remodelling. \n\nThe mineralized bone remodelling is a dynamic process and occurs throughout \n\nthe life of the individual. It produces new bone to be able to handle the demands \n\nof mechanical stresses. Primary gap remodelling also occurs during the repair \n\nprocess and lamellar bone (that presents collagen in a lamellar structure) is \n\nused as scaffold. After ca. 4 weeks osteogenesis stops leaving behind a \n\nvascularized cavity called an osteon that runs parallel to the long axis. A greater \n\nultimate strength is obtained when a more osteons cross the injury site. \n\nIn primary gap healing, remodeling is important for restoring tissue strength. \n\nHowever, in primary contact healing, remodeling is coupled to the repair \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nprocess. During contact remodeling, the cutting cones mature, depositing \n\nlamellar bone centripetally to form ring-shaped structures. \n\nThe remodelling can last until 6 months and the healed bone is similar to the \n\nnon-injured tissue in terms of robustness, although, it appears less organized. \n\nIn this step it is also required to remove the excess of callus produced during \n\nthe bone repair, being this step one of the main differences between the two \n\nreparation processes: primary and secondary. This callus removal is executed \n\nby the osteoclasts (Figure 3 (b)) [11]. \n\n \n\n2.5 Self-regeneration of bone \n\nBone is a dynamic tissue that is being formed and resorbed in a \n\ncontinuous cycle. These activities are executed in response to hormonal and \n\nphysical factors. Bone is able to regenerate under different circumstances, e.g. \n\nwhen a fracture occurs in the bone. Unfortunately, this ability for self-\n\nregeneration is limited when the size of the trauma is too large. These cases \n\nare known as critical size defects due to the inability of the bone to self-\n\nregenerate. In order to repair these defects it is mandatory to execute a bone \n\nreplacement. This can be achieved using a series of different biomaterials [12]. \n\n3. Biomaterials relevant to bone regeneration/repair \nA biomaterial is a synthetic or natural material used to: replace part of \n\nliving tissue; or to restore a specific function of the living tissue. From this \n\ndefinition it is clear to understand that the development of biomaterials usually \n\ncomprise different fields of knowledge (Table 2), from materials science, biology \n\nand medicine. The effective influence of these areas is dependent on the \n\nspecific tissue that is targeted and the function that the biomaterial is required to \n\nexecute. In Table 3 is shown the application areas of the biomaterials. These \n\ncan range from assistance in the diagnostic and treatment of diseases to tissue \n\nreplacement or correction and improvement of tissue function [13]. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nTable 2: Fields of knowledge relevant for the development of biomaterials [13]. \n\nKnowledge domain Examples \n\nMaterials science \n\nand engineering \n\nStructure-property relationship of synthetic and biological \n\nmaterials including metals, ceramics, polymers, \n\ncomposites, tissues (blood and connective tissues), etc. \n\nBiology and \n\nphysiology \n\nCell and molecular biology, anatomy, animal and human \n\nphysiology, histopathology; experimental surgery, \n\nimmunology, etc \n\nClinical sciences All the clinical specialties: dentistry, maxillofacial, \n\nneurosurgery, obstetrics and gynecology, ophthalmology, \n\northopaedics, otolaryngology, plastic and reconstructive \n\nsurgery, thoracic and cardiovascular surgery, veterinary \n\nmedicine, and surgery, etc. \n\n \n\nTable 3: Different areas where the use of biomaterials has been exploited [13]. \n\nArea of intervention Examples \n\nReplacement of diseased or damaged \n\npart \n\nArtificial hip joint, kidney dialysis \n\nmachine \n\nAssist in healing Sutures, bones plates, and screws \n\nImprove function Cardiac pacemaker, intraocular lens \n\nCorrect functional abnormality Cardiac pacemaker \n\nCorrect cosmetic problem Augmentation mammoplasty, chin \n\naugmentation \n\nAid to diagnosis Probes and catheters \n\nAid to treatment Catheters, drains \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\nThe specific biological responses that the different biomaterials promote when \n\nin contact with the cells and body fluids are an important factor to be considered \n\nwhen designing new biomaterials [14-16]. In fact, the biomaterial-cell interaction \n\nis governed by the biomaterial surface and composition. Moreover, the different \n\nbiomaterial properties (e.g. mechanical, biocompatibility, etc.) are governing \n\ntheir application area. \n\nTable 4: Different types of biomaterials [13]. \n\nBiomaterial Advantages Disadvantages Examples \n\nPolymers (nylon, silicone \n\nrubber, polyester, \n\npoytetrafuoroethylene, \n\netc.) \n\nResilient \n\nEasy to \n\nfabricate \n\nNot strong \n\nDeforms with \n\ntime, may \n\ndegrade \n\nSutures, blood \n\nvessels, hip \n\nsocket, ear, nose, \n\nother soft tissues, \n\nsutures \n\nMetals (Ti and its alloys, \n\nCo-Cr alloys, stainless \n\nsteels, Au, Ag, Pt, etc.) \n\nStrong, tough, \n\nductile \n\nMay corrode, \n\ndense, difficult \n\nto make \n\nJoint \n\nreplacements, \n\nbone plates and \n\nscrews, dental root \n\nimplants, pacer \n\nand sutures wires \n\nCeramics (aluminium \n\noxide, calcium \n\nphosphates including \n\nhydroxyapatite, carbon) \n\nVery \n\nbiocompatible, \n\ninert, strong in \n\ncompression \n\nBrittle, not \n\nresilient, difficult \n\nto make \n\nDental; femoral \n\nhead of hip \n\nreplacement, \n\ncoating of dental \n\nand orthopaedic \n\nimplants \n\nComposites (carbon-\n\ncarbon, fibre-reinforced \n\nbone cement) \n\nStrong, tailor-\n\nmade \n\nDifficult to make Joint implants, \n\nheart valves \n\n \n\nAs can be seen from Table 4, in general, biomaterials can be produced from a \n\nvariety of different materials (e.g. polymers, metals, ceramics and composites), \n\nalthough, their selection is dependent on their specific properties. As an \n\nexample, while ceramics, metals and composites are usually used to repair \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\ntissues that require high mechanical modulus, polymers that present lower \n\nmechanical modulus are usually selected to develop biomaterials for the repair \n\nor substitution of soft tissue. In the following subsection it will be presented \n\nexamples of ceramic-based biomaterials due to the fact that is the type of \n\nbiomaterials that presents more similarities with the systems studied under this \n\nthesis (GICs). \n\n3.1 Ceramic-based biomaterials \n\nCalcium phosphate cements (CPCs) were introduced in the field of \n\nbioceramics more than two decades ago and represented a real change in the \n\nmedical applications. The possibility to have an injectable material with \n\nmouldable behaviour represented benefits for several clinical applications, e.g. \n\nminicracks, maxillofacial deformities and defects, vertebroplasty, among many \n\nothers. \n\nThe formation of CPCs is based on the combination of one or more calcium \n\northophosphates. These phosphates are mixed with the liquid phase forming a \n\npaste that is able to set and harden after being implanted within the body. The \n\nCPC setting occurs through dissolution and precipitation of its components \n\nthroughout the curing reactions. Its hardening is based on the entanglement of \n\nthe precipitated crystalline phases. The most stable crystalline phases formed \n\nduring the CPC curing are hydroxyapatite and brushite at pH >4.2 and pH<4.2, \n\nrespectively [17]. \n\nThe understanding of the mechanism of interaction of CPCs, allows accessing \n\ntheir long-term potential. It has been shown the occurrence of a gradual \n\nmodification at the ceramic surface due to dissolution, precipitation and ion-\n\nexchange reactions. These events results in the production of a carbonate-\n\ncontaining, calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite with small crystal sizes. These \n\nchanges are the beginning of a series of events that promotes bioactivity and \n\nthat induces parallel reactions in cellular activity, bone mineralization and \n\norganic matrix deposition. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\nAbsorption of proteins and other biological molecules occurs and the \n\nsurrounding cells attach to the CPC surface. All these phenomena lead to the \n\ngradual incorporation of the ceramic into the regenerated bone tissue. Calcium \n\nphosphate ceramics include several materials which differ not only in their \n\nchemical composition, but also in their specific surface area, macro- and \n\nmicroporosity and crystal structure. There are differences due to variations in \n\nthe calcium to phosphate ratio; as examples, tricalcium phosphate, \n\nhydroxyapatite and tetracalcium phosphate have Ca/P ratios of 1.50, 1.67 and \n\n2.00 respectively, and there are other materials with ratios in between these \n\n(Table 5). Furthermore, hydroxyl ions may be missing from the structure, as in \n\noxyhydroxyapatite, and other trace ions may be present. The importance of \n\nthese compositional variations is not merely academic but they affect the \n\nbiological response [18]. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 5: The main calcium phosphates used in the biomedical field [8]. \n\nCompounds Chemical Formula (Ca/P) Molar \n\nRatio \n\nAbbreviation \n\nPrecipitated CaP \n\nDicalcium phosphate CaHPO4 1.00 DCP \n\nMonocalcium \n\nphosphate \n\nmonohydrate \n\nCa(HPO4)2.H2O 0.50 MCPM \n\nDicalcium phosphate \n\ndihydrate (Brushite) \n\nCa(HPO4)2.2H2O 1.00 DCPD \n\nOctacalcium \n\nphosphate \n\nCa8H2(PO4)6.5H2O 1.33 OCP \n\nPrecipitated \n\nhydroxypatite \n\n(tricalcium phosphate) \n\nCa10-x(HPO4)x(PO4)6-\n\nx(OH)2-x0?x?2 \n\n1.50-1.67 PHA \n\nAmorphous calcium \n\nphosphate \n\nCa3(PO4)2.nH2O \n\nn = 3-4.5; 15-20 % \n\nH2O \n\n1.50 ACP \n\nHigh-Temperature CaP \n\nMonocalcium \n\nphosphate \n\nCa(HPO4)2 0.50 MCP \n\n?-Tricalcium \n\nphosphate \n\n?-Ca3(HPO4)2 1.50 ?-TCP \n\n?-Tricalcium \n\nphosphate \n\n?-Ca3(PO4)2 1.50 ?-TCP \n\nSintered hydroxypatite Ca5(PO4)3OH 1.67 HA \n\nOxyapatite Ca10(PO4)6O 1.67 OXA \n\nTetracalcium \n\nphosphate \n\nCa4(PO4)2O 2.00 TetCP \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\n \n\nDifferent types of bone cements are available for filling bone defects originated \n\nby illness or traumatic accident. More recently, bone cements have been tested \n\nfor tendon-bone healing. In this perspective, Osteocrete, a magnesium-based \n\ninjectable bone cement, has been reported to possess tensile strength 3 times \n\nhigher than the calcium-based CPCs in both tendon-bone attachments and \n\nbone-bone structures. It has also been shown to enhance the formation of bone \n\ncallous in an osteotomy model when compared with CPCs. While these \n\npreliminary studies are encouraging, the ability of Osteocrete to improve the \n\nhealing of the bone tissue has not been studied [19]. \n\nSynthetic hydroxyapatite is a calcium-phosphate bioceramic of general \n\nchemical formula Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2. It has been tested in the development of \n\ndifferent types of biomaterials mainly targeting the substitution/regeneration of \n\nbone. This approach follows a biomimetic path derived from the fact that \n\nhydroxyapatite is one of the main constituents of natural bone. In fact, the \n\ninclusion of hydroxyapatite in biomaterials usually enhances their bioactivity and \n\nbiocompatibility [20-23].The advances in the ceramic technology generated a \n\nsignificant number of ceramic materials for medical purposes. As an example, \n\ntricalcium phosphate (TCP) was first proposed in 1920 as a bioresorbable \n\nsubstance to fill bone defects. However, TCP is a weak ceramic, unable to \n\nsustain significant loading. The need for tougher and stronger ceramics was not \n\nmet before 1965, when the fillers alumina-based materials were proposed for \n\nthe substitution of hip joints. Zirconia and synthetic calcium phosphate ceramics \n\n(together with other calcium and/or phosphorus containing ceramics and \n\nglasses) were then proposed as alternatives to alumina and TCP, respectively. \n\nAfter roughly 100 years of clinical use, we come to the conclusion that there is, \n\nso far, no ceramic biomaterial able to create a strong and biologically relevant \n\ninterface with bone. On the other hand, ceramics and glasses are able to \n\npromote direct bone-implant adhesion without soft tissue interlayer, although, \n\ntheir mechanical properties are not sufficient to allow their use in load-bearing \n\napplications [24]. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2 Biocompatibility and bioactivity \n\nBiocompatibility is defined as the ability of a material has to give an \n\nappropriate response to a specific application (this definition was established by \n\nconsensus among the specialists in the field of biomaterials, in a conference in \n\nChester, UK. Williams 1987). Inevitably the introduction of a new material in the \n\nhuman body produces a specific response that depends on the composition of \n\nthe biomaterial, shape, size, geometry and aspects of the organism/patient such \n\nas age, immunological sensitivity, health, local implant, among others. \n\nTherefore, it is difficult to mention what are the parameters that should be \n\naccounted to evaluate the biocompatibility of a specific material. Under this \n\nperspective each biomaterial should be evaluated according to the roles that it \n\nwas designed to execute [25]. \n\nThe bioactivity of a material is related with his ability to produce a chemical or \n\nbiological response from the surrounding medium in order to promote tissue \n\nregeneration. A typical in vitro bioactivity test evaluates the ability of the \n\nbiomaterial to form an apatite surface layer when in contact with simulated body \n\nfluid (SBF), a solution that presents the ionic concentrations similar to human \n\nblood plasma. The higher the ability of the biomaterial to form an apatite layer \n\nthe higher is its bioactive potential [26]. As an example bioglass was the first \n\nsuccessful glass to present bioactivity. It was first reported by Hench and co-\n\nworkers in 1970s and was used clinically. The main application of these glasses \n\nis for replacement of the damaged tissue, as for example, treatment of facial \n\nbone injuries or benign bone tumours [27, 28]. \n\n3.3 The relevance of biodegradability \n\nBiodegradable biomaterials are used in reconstructive surgery when the \n\nbody itself has the capacity to self-regenerate the damaged tissue. Usually, a \n\nbiomaterial to be used under this approach needs to present bioactivity and to \n\npromote tissue growth/regeneration. Upon application, the biomaterial start the \n\ndegrade allowing the surrounding tissue to grow to the intervened area. The \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\ncorrect matching between its degradation rate and the tissue \n\ngrowth/regeneration allows a complete regeneration of the damaged tissue \n\nupon full degradation of the biomaterial. Under this perspective it is of critical \n\nimportance the non-toxicity of the degradation products. The first synthesized \n\nbiodegradable biomaterial approved to be used in clinical applications (e.g. \n\nsutures) was the poly(glycolic acid) (PGA). With the progress of tissue \n\nengineering other biodegradable materials were developed (e.g. gellan gum, \n\netc.) [29, 30]. The biodegradable biomaterials can be applied in the biomedical \n\nfield in a diversified manner. In Table 6 it is presented examples of the targeted \n\napplications of biomedical devices produced using biodegradable biomaterials \n\n[8]. \n\nTable 6: Applications of biodegradable biomaterials in biomedical devices. \n\nApplication Biomedical device \n\nAdhesion and fixation of \n\ntissues \n\nSuture, bone fixation material and adhesive \n\nSupport and reinforcement Suture reinforcement material \n\nTemporary substitutes for \n\ntissues \n\nSubstitute material for endocranium \n\nShape maintenance and \n\nisolation \n\nMembrane for prevention of tissue adhesion \n\nSecuring space for tissue \n\nregeneration \n\nGuided tissue regeneration, guided bone \n\nregeneration \n\nScaffold for tissue \n\nregeneration \n\nSkin, cartilage, bone, blood vessel \n\n \n\nA common approach to impart biodegradability to different biomaterials is the \n\naddition of starch. This methodology has been attempted in the development of \n\nbone cements [31, 32]. Starch is a glucose-based polymer created by the \n\ncombination of two structures: amylose and amylopectin (Figure 4). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4: Structure of starch (amylose and amylopectin) [33].  \n\n \n\nAmylose is an essentially linear structure where the glucose units are joined by \n\n?(1?4) glycosidic linkages. Amylopectin consists of linear ?(1?4) linked \n\nglucose chains including branched positions with ?(1?6) linkages every 24 to \n\n30 glucose residues, on average [8]. \n\nOne of the main advantages of including biodegradable starch in the \n\nformulation of biomaterials is the presence of ?-amylase in the Human body that \n\nis specific for starch components. Additionally, its degradation products are not \n\ntoxic and metabolized by the body. \n\n4. Glass-ionomer cements (GICs) \n4.1 The development of GICs \n\nWilson and Kent created the first conventional GICs combining a glass \n\npowder from the system SiO2-Al2O3-CaO-CaF2 with PAA, as a result of their \n\npioneering work at the Laboratory of the Government Chemist, London, in the \n\nearly 1970s [34-49]. The studied glasses became vulnerable to acid attack and \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\nestablished a strong link with the acidic PAA [40]. Initial application of these \n\nGICs was in dentistry, as a colour matched alternatives to amalgam restoratives \n\ndue to two main advantages: strong adhesion to dentin and ability to prevent \n\ncaries in tooth structures [34, 50-52]. Research work during the following \n\ndecades addressed their main disadvantages, namely, sensitivity to moisture \n\nduring initial hardening; poor mechanical properties, among others [53]. \n\nDifferent optimizations introduced in the following decades resulted in the \n\ndevelopment of conventional GIC formulations that present enhanced \n\nmechanical performance, tuned curing time and reduced sensitivity to moisture. \n\nMore significant modifications were promoted with the addition of UV-curable \n\nresins in the cement matrix. These resin-modified GICs present mechanical \n\nproperties that overpass most of the conventional GICs, although, their anti-\n\ncariogenic potential was significantly reduced. In this sense, their properties, \n\nease of moulding and ease of application, still makes conventional GIC as an \n\nextremely versatile solution for cementing a series of different biomaterials. \n\n4.2 The importance of glass composition \n\nThe glass powder present in GIC formulations is usually composed by \n\ncalcium fluoroaluminosilicates. This component has two main functions: 1) to \n\nact as a source of cations essential for the evolution of the cement curing \n\nreactions; and 2) to reinforce the final cement structure. \n\nWithin the typical glass systems used in GIC formulations it is possible to \n\ndistinguish glass formers (e.g. SiO2), glass modifiers (Ca\n2+) and components \n\nwith intermediate behaviour (e.g. Al2O3). The selection of components to be \n\nused in the glass formulation is dependent on several factors, including their \n\ninfluence in: the glass mechanical properties; the glass reactivity; and, most \n\nimportant, the glass basicity. In fact, the GIC curing is governed by acid-base \n\nreactions between an acidic polymer and a basic glass. In this sense, it is \n\nmandatory that the glass structure presents significant basicity. This basicity is \n\nusually conferred by the modifier cations. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\n4.3 Methodologies to synthesize the glass component \n\n4.3.1 Melt-quenching methodology \n\nMelt-quenching methodology is a high temperature process that involves \n\nthe melting of the whole glass formulation and its subsequent fast decrease of \n\ntemperature below the glass transition (Tg). This procedure induces the \n\nformation of the short to medium range order that is characteristic of glasses. \n\nThe timeframe of the temperature reduction is so short that it does not allow the \n\nformation of long-range structural ordering. In general, glasses produced by this \n\nmethodology present higher stability when compared with other glass \n\npreparation methods, e.g. sol-gel. Additionally, melt-quenched glasses usually \n\npromote the improvement of the mechanical behaviour of GIC compositions \n\n[14]. \n\nOne of the main drawbacks of the melt-quenching technique is the fact that not \n\nall the compositions produce a melt. Depending on the glass compositions the \n\nmelting temperature of the formulation is, in some cases, difficult to achieve with \n\nlaboratory furnaces. Additionally, in the quenching step it is important to reach \n\nthe appropriate temperature decrease rate that is also dependent on the \n\ncomposition. This should be fast enough to limit nucleation and to inhibit \n\ncrystallization of the structure, although, nucleation and crystallization rates are \n\nalso dependent on the composition. In fact, some formulations present a very \n\nhigh nucleation and crystallization rate and the production of pure glass phases \n\nis difficult. In these cases the melt quenching methodology generates crystalline \n\nphases within the glass phase, i.e. glass-ceramics. \n\n4.3.2 Sol-gel methodology \n\nThe sol-gel methodology is based on the hydrolysis and condensation of \n\nthe glass former precursors (e.g. silicon and aluminium alkoxides, etc.) \n\nsolubilised in specific solvents (e.g. water, ethanol, etc.). It also involves the \n\naddition of nitrates or chlorides of the glass modifiers (e.g. calcium nitrate, etc.) \n\nto the processing solution and the use of specific catalytic and/or initiator \n\nconditions (e.g. ammonium hydroxide, etc.). This approach presents a series of \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\nadvantages compared to the melt-quenching approach, namely: a better \n\ncompositional control; morphological control (e.g. particles, fibers, membranes, \n\netc.); lower processing temperatures; among others [54]. \n\nThe main reactions occurring during the sol-gel methodology are the hydrolysis \n\nof the glass precursors and their subsequent condensation. For the first step to \n\noccur it is essential the presence of an hydrolyzing medium (e.g. water) in order \n\nto produce the hydroxides/acids of the glass formers (e.g. silicic acid, aluminium \n\nhydroxide, etc.). The condensation reaction (second step) occurs between the \n\ndifferent hydroxides/acids with the release of water molecules. This step is \n\nusually catalysed by different compounds, e.g. ammonium hydroxide, nitric acid, \n\netc. [55]. Depending on the targeted morphology, the methodology can include \n\nan additional step usually designated as gelation. In this step the colloidal \n\nsolution of particles is aged allowing their condensation into a macroscopic \n\nsystem (Figure 5) [14]. \n\n \n\nFigure 5: Sol-gel process (https://www.llnl.gov/str/May05/Satcher.html). \n\nThe whole sol-gel methodology is performed at lower temperatures than the \n\nmelt-quenching approach. This characteristic imparts the valuable advantage of \n\nenabling the preparation of glasses incorporating bioactive compounds (e.g. \n\nproteins, drugs, etc.) sensitive to high temperatures [56, 57]. Moreover, glasses \n\nproduced by this methodology usually present higher specific surface area and \n\nbioactivity [58]. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n22 \n\n \n\n4.4 The polymeric component \n\n The GICs curing reactions only occurs if the polymeric component \n\npresent significant acidity. Throughout the development and optimization of GIC \n\ndifferent polymers have been tested in the formulations. As examples, can be \n\npointed out PAA, poly (acrylic acid-co-itaconic acid) and poly (acrylic-co-maleic \n\nacid) with structural formulas presented in Figure 6 [59]. \n\n \n\nPoly(acrylic acid) \n\n  \n\nPoly(acrylic acid-co-itaconic acid) Poly(acrylic-co-maleic acid) \n\nFigure 6: Polymers already tested in the development of GIC formulations. \n\nFrom all the polymeric components tested until today PAA continues to be the \n\nmost used in GIC formulations. This is essentially due to its high acidity, \n\navailability and lower price when compared to the other tested polymers [59]. \n\nThe PAA molecular weight (Mw) directly influences cement mechanical \n\nbehaviour and the cement paste initial viscosity. GIC mechanical performance \n\nis enhanced with PAA of high Mw, although, their high viscosity limits the \n\nhomogeneity and mixability of the cement pastes. In this perspective, it is \n\nimportant to obtain a compromise between these two properties. The optimal \n\nformulations are prepared with polymeric components that have the highest Mw \n\nwithout significantly affecting the viscosity of the cement paste [60-63]. \n\n4.5 GIC curing reactions \n\nGICs are formed when an acid-base reaction occurs between the glass \n\npowder and an aqueous solution of PAA, creating an inorganic-organic \n\ninterlinked structure. The curing mechanism is composed by two general steps, \n\ngelation (Figure 7) and maturation. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7: GICs curing reactions during the gelation stage [64]. \n\nDuring gelation, hydrated protons from the PAA/H2O penetrate the surface of \n\nthe glass particles and attack its basic sites (i.e. cations such as Na+, Ca2+, \n\noctahedral Al3+, etc.). The cations from the surface layer are leached to the \n\ncement matrix, promoting the ionic cross-linking of the PAA chains, through \n\ntheir carboxylate anions. This step usually occurs under a timeframe of \n\napproximately, 30 min. During the maturation step the tetrahedral aluminium \n\npresent in the glass particle surface layer is leached under the same type of \n\nPAA acid attack. The longer timeframe of this maturation step (approximately, \n\n24h) is attributed to the higher stability of the tetrahedral aluminium that is \n\ncovalently bounded within the glass structure [34, 41, 50, 65-70]. \n\n4.6 Properties, applications and importance of GICs and its \n\nconstituents \n\n4.6.1 Properties of GICs \n\nThere are a series of advantages on using GIC as cementation agent of \n\ndifferent dental restorations, namely: chemical adhesion to tooth; anti-cariogenic \n\neffect; mechanical behaviour under compression loading; among others. The \n\nGIC chemical adhesion to the tooth is due to the dentin chemical structure. This \n\nis one of the main advantages of the GICs and is based on formation of ionic \n\ncross-links between the PAA carboxylate anions and the Ca2+ from the dentin\u2019s \n\nhydroxyapatite [71]. Their anti-cariogenic effect is mainly related with the use of \n\nfluorine in the glass compositions. Fluorine is gradually leached from GIC to the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n24 \n\n \n\nsurrounding dentin strengthening the tooth resistance to bacterial proliferation \n\n[44, 72]. Moreover, it has been proven that GICs are able to act as a fluorine \n\nreservoir. In this sense GICs are not only leaching fluorine to the surrounding \n\ntissue but is also able to uptake additional fluorine from the surroundings (e.g. \n\ntoothpastes) [73]. In relation to the mechanical behaviour, Kenny et al reported \n\nthat it depends on the molecular weight (Mw) of PAA [74]. Additionally, the \n\npowder to liquid ratio [75], concentration of PAA and the use of chelating agents \n\nalso influences the final performance of the GICs. In general, the available \n\nformulations achieve compressive strengths up to 200 MPa and biaxial flexural \n\nstrengths up to 50 MPa. The ratio of \u201cbound\u201d and \u201cunbounded\u201d water is a \n\ndeterminant factor affecting the GIC properties. In fact, the highest is the \n\nproportion of \u201cunbounded\u201d water the lower is the mechanical performance and \n\nthe GIC general stability. Finally, the glass particle size also influences \n\nsignificantly the mechanical behaviour of the GICs and the cement curing \n\nreactions. The lower the glass particle size, the higher is its surface area and \n\nlower is the GIC crack deflection [76]. The main drawback of the reduction of \n\nthe particle size is related with the faster setting kinetics. This variation reduces \n\nthe time available to the medical doctor to manipulate the cement paste and to \n\napply it at the intervention site. In this sense, it is always desirable to obtain a \n\ncompromise between glass particle size, mechanical properties and GIC setting \n\nkinetics to develop optimized formulations. \n\nA number of modifications can be made in the formulations to enhance the GIC \n\nproperties, namely: (1) alternative polymers, as the polyacid component; (2) \n\ndried polymers blended with the glass and activation by the addition of water; \n\n(3) ceramic-metal hybrid cements; (4) metal-reinforced cement for enhanced \n\nmechanical properties; (5) resin-modified GICs (RMGICs) using initiators and \n\nresins capable of undergoing photochemical polymerization [35, 77]. \n\nGICs have demonstrated to possess biocompatibility and bioactivity. These \n\ncements are able to release osteoconductive ions such as calcium and fluoride  \n\nto the surrounding tissue [65]. The incorporation of strontium in the glass \n\nformulations has been done for several years due to its characteristic \n\nproperties, namely: radiopacifier, antibacterial properties and can help in the \n\nregeneration of healthy bone. In fact, it has been proven that low doses of \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\nstrontium (300 mg Kg-1 day-1 of Sr2+ for 9 weeks) can stimulate bone formation \n\nand inhibit bone resorption in both animal and humans. Strontium has an affinity \n\nfor bone being incorporated by surface exchange and ionic substitution [78]. \n\n4.6.2 Applications of GICs \n\nGICs have been tested in the cementation of different biomaterials \n\ndedicated to the repair or substitution of tooth and bone. Its main application \n\narea continues to be the dentistry field, where conventional GICs are used to \n\ncement different types of composites used to repair teeth or as temporary filler \n\nbefore the application of a definitive dental restoration. Non-conventional GICs, \n\nsuch as the RMGICs have been additionally proposed as definitive dental \n\nrestorations [44, 79-81]. \n\nHurrell-Gillingham and co-workers suggest that the main properties of GICs \n\n(including adhesion to mineralized tissues, minimal exotherm during setting and \n\ngood biocompatibility) enables them to be exploited in the otology field [82]. \n\nAlthough, the most relevant and underexploited application of GIC remains to \n\nbe in the orthopaedic field as bone cements [74]. \n\n4.6.3 Biocompatibility of GICs \n\nGICs are not bioinert but should be classified as bioactive. Hatton and \n\nco-workers tested a set of GICs under in vitro cell culture and they \n\ndemonstrated that some GICs are biocompatibility. Although, other studies \n\nproved that the ions present in GICs namely aluminium and fluoride are \n\nresponsible for the toxicicity of some formulations. These studies also report a \n\nrelation between the toxicity of the formulations and the ionic concentrations \n\nand culture conditions [83]. \n\n4.6.4 The importance of GIC cations in the regeneration of tissue \n\nThe GICs have been tested in vivo with encouraging results. The \n\nformation of bone was observed in some formulations after 6 weeks of \n\nimplantation and being stable during 1 year. In addition, in the short term there \n\nis an inflammatory response observed in soft tissues adjacent to the GIC. The \n\ntissue reaction was caused by one or both of the following factors: \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n26 \n\n \n\n(i) Reduction of tissue pH due to the acidic PAA. This is the most probable \n\ncause of tissue necrosis (a damage of the surrounding tissues). \n\n(ii) Release of free glass particles from the cement to the surrounding tissues. \n\nThis is probably induced by the excess of water originated on the surrounding \n\ntissue that migrates to the GIC affecting its curing reactions and promoting the \n\nrelease of glass particles. Glass particles are known to cause inflammatory \n\nresponse in adjacent soft tissues. In surgery (e.g. dentistry), it is important to \n\navoid excess of the moisture contamination during placement of the GICs. \n\nA limited dose of ion release is the significant factor that determines tissue \n\nresponse to regeneration. In contrast, as previously mentioned, high levels of \n\nionic leaching from the GIC can produce inflammatory response. Upon GIC \n\napplication it is expectable an initial time period where inflammation occurs in \n\nthe surrounding tissue due to higher levels of ionic and PAA leaching from the \n\nGIC. After this initial timeframe the inflammatory response is suppressed and \n\nthe GIC appears with a layer of relatively mature bone tissue. At this stage the \n\nosteoconductive potential of the GIC is evident (a property not common in other \n\ntypes of bone cements) [83]. \n\na) Aluminium and its toxicity \n\nAluminium in the ionic form (Al3+) has several implications in human \n\nhealth and its toxicity has been studied by several authors. This cation is \n\nresponsible for many degenerative diseases including Alzheimer\u2019s and \n\nParkinson\u2019s. Boyce and co-workers reported that encephalopathy and \n\nosteomalacia was detected in patients being subject to dialysis. It was observed \n\nthat the water used in the dialysis contained high levels of aluminium. Bone \n\nbiopsies detected the presence of high levels of aluminium in the bone, \n\nconfirming that the origin of the detected pathologies was the aluminium present \n\nin the water used for the dialysis [84]. \n\nAnother case study (a bone reconstruction of a woman with 52 years old) was \n\nreported by Reusche et al. This reconstruction was performed with a GIC \n\nprepared by mixing a calcium aluminium fluorosilicate glass and an aqueous \n\nsolution of polycarboxylic acid. This GIC (Ionocem) contained high levels of \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n27 \n\n \n\naluminium and six weeks after implantation the patient presented a fatal \n\naluminium encephalopathy (see Figure 8) [85]. \n\n \n\nFigure 8: Aluminium inflammatory response of Al-based GICs resulting in an irregular \n\ndensity at the specific positions (arrowheads) [85]. \n\nIn general, it has been accepted that the release of aluminium present in the \n\nGICs formulations, used as bone cements, produces a deleterious effect in the \n\nhealth of the intervened patients [85]. Although, this has been considered a \n\ncritical component of the glass compositions used to prepare GICs. In fact, it \n\nhas been proposed that Al3+ has a critical role in the formation of the PAA \n\ncarboxylate cross-links within the GIC cement matrix [86]. Under this \n\nperspective, Boyd and co-workers tested several aluminium-free glass \n\ncompositions and their cement forming ability. Under these studies the same \n\nauthors found that glass compositions where aluminium was substituted by zinc \n\nare able to produce GIC. The developed formulations presented properties that \n\nare consistent with their application in orthopaedic procedures, according to \n\nISO5833 [78, 87]. \n\nb) Other relevant cations \n\nThere are a series of other cations that possess a relevant role in the \n\nsetting chemistry and final properties of the GICs. As stated before, zinc has \n\ndemonstrated that it is able to substitute aluminium in the glass compositions \n\nused to prepare GICs. Although not completely proven, it is reported that zinc \n\nimparted other relevant properties to the final GICs, namely: bactericidal and \n\nbioactivity.  Zinc is also an essential trace element which presents effects on in \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n28 \n\n \n\nvitro and in vivo bone formation and bone protein synthesis. It promotes the \n\nproliferation of osteoblasts and many biological functions. It promotes new bone \n\nformation in the surroundings of the implants [88]. Additionally, zinc deficiency \n\nmay be a risk factor in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis [89]. \n\nTheir bivalency makes the cations derived from the elements of the second \n\ngroup of the periodic table, namely, magnesium, calcium and strontium, suitable \n\nto act as PAA ionic cross-linkers. In fact, calcium has been described as the \n\nsecond most relevant cations in the GIC setting chemistry [90]. It has been \n\nreported in the glass composition since the initial development of the GICs. Its \n\nrole is similar to aluminium in the cross-linking of the PAA network through \n\ncalcium-carboxylate ionic linkages. Due to their similar characteristic, \n\nmagnesium and strontium have an equivalent potential. In contrast, beryllium \n\nand barium are usually not included due to their toxicity. \n\nThe nature of strontium and its biological function has not been investigated as \n\nextensively as the role of calcium and magnesium of the same chemical family. \n\nStrontium is believed to have a participation in dental tissue mineralization due \n\nto their properties similar to those presented by calcium. Its antibacterial effect \n\nhas been claimed but remains to be clarified: previous in vitro work on \n\ncommercial RMGIC (Fuji II LC) showed that strontium was not cytotoxic when in \n\ncontact with human osteoblastic cells. Strontium, as a substitute of calcium in \n\nhydroxyapatite, has been studied recently and claimed to prevent bone \n\nfractures [90]. In addition, strontium may inhibit osteoclastic turnover and \n\npromote the osteoblastic one. Moreover, bone strength increases and the risk of \n\nfractures decrease [91, 92]. It has been also reported to contribute to the \n\nincrease in bone mass and volume when given at low doses, re-mineralizing \n\nskeletal lesions. It seems that strontium directly suppresses bone resorption \n\nand has no deleterious effect on bone mineralization. Strontium has also \n\nreported to have beneficial effects on bone formation in rodents and humans \n\nwhich results in increased trabecular volume. It has been also confirmed that \n\nstrontium increases the bone strength and in bone density due to its higher \n\natomic weight in comparison with calcium. Strontium is currently used as dopant \n\nof the crystalline structures of calcium salts to improve their biological \n\nproperties. The successful incorporation of strontium ions in the composition of \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n29 \n\n \n\nhydroxyapatite, calcium phosphate cements and calcium silicates help on the \n\nproliferation and activity of osteoblastic cells [58]. Finally, Johnson et al. studied \n\nthe effect of the incorporation of strontium in GICs. They reported a relation \n\nbetween the presence of strontium in the GIC and a marked reduction of bone \n\nash; increase in the amount of magnesium and potassium in the bone; and by \n\ndepressed calcium contents as compared to normal bone [93]. \n\nDrouet et al. studied the effect of strontium and magnesium in the formation of \n\napatites. They observed that the magnesium taken up was found to be \n\nreversibly fixed to the apatite structure independently of their maturation stage. \n\nIn contrast, the amount of reversibly fixed strontium decreased noticeably with \n\nmaturation in a strontium-containing solution. These findings suggested that \n\nmagnesium remained mostly on the surface of nanocrystalline apatites whereas \n\nstrontium was progressively incorporated into the growing apatite domains [94]. \n\nMagnesium is a cation that presents high physiological interests in the \n\nbiomedical field. It is essential to human metabolism and is naturally present in \n\nthe bone. It may actually have stimulatory effects on the growth of new bone \n\nand it is classified as an essential element for the human body [88]. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I \u2013 General Introduction \n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n\nBibliography \n1.

In this \n\nperspective G1 composition was not used to prepare GICs. \n\n \n\nUpon mixing, the formulations were dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 35 \u00baC [1-\n\n3]. The dried formulations were heated in a crucible to 300 \u00baC for 30 minutes to \n\nrelease the ammonia from the diammonium hydrogen phosphate; 650 \u00baC for 30 \n\nminutes to allow the release of carbon dioxide from the carbonates; and 1300 \u00baC \n\nto allow the complete melting of the mixture [4, 5]. The melted mixtures were \n\nsplat quenched by pouring the melt onto a metal plate maintained at room \n\ntemperature (Figure 1) [6-13]. \n\n \n\nFigure 1: Illustration the melt quenching process. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n41 \n\n \n\nThe glass blocks were frozen with liquid nitrogen and grounded with a pestle and \n\nmortar (Figure 2). Upon size reduction the glass particles were separated by \n\nsizes using an Analytical Sieve Shaker (Retsch AS200) for 5 min at a rate of 60 \n\nrpm. With this methodology it was possible to collect the glass fractions that \n\npresented particle sizes of x<63 \u00b5m, 63 \u00b5m<x<125 \u00b5m and 125 \u00b5m<x<250 \u00b5m. \n\nFigure 2: Glass powder preparation and sieving. \n\n2.2 Cement preparation \n\nCement formulations were prepared by mixing the glass powder with PAA and \n\nwater at appropriate amounts (55: 21: 24 by mass). After mixing, the cement \n\npastes were introduced into a Teflon mould to produce cylindrical cement \n\nspecimens of 6 mm diameter and 11 mm height (Figure 3). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3: Example of the preparation of a moulded cement formulation. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n42 \n\nThe cement formulation that presented higher mechanical resistance was \n\nmodified in an attempt to enhance its biodegradability. For this purpose it was \n\nadded corn starch to the formulation (5 and 25 % by weight) [14]. \n\n3. Characterization methodologies    \n3.1 Mechanical performance under compression loading    \n\nAll the developed cements were mechanically evaluated under compression \n\nloading. For each formulation it was prepared six cylindrical specimens (as \n\ndetailed in the cement preparation section). The mechanical loading was \n\nexecuted on an Instron 5540 (Instron, USA) equipped with a load cell of 1 kN and \n\n2 mm/min of crosshead speed (Figure 4). In all cases, the samples were \n\nmaintained at room temperature for 24 hours prior to the mechanical testing [15]. \n\nFrom the stress-strain curves it was determined the compression modulus (CM) \n\nand the compressive strength (CS). The compression modulus was determined \n\nas the initial slope (elastic regime) of the stress-strain curves. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4: Instron 5540, Universal mechanical testing machine. \n\nThe CS was calculated from equation 1: \n\n \n\nEquation 1 \n\nPosition of \nthe cement \nspecimen \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n43 \n\nwhere, CS is the compressive strength (MPa), ? is the maximum applied load (N) \n\nand d is the diameter of the sample (mm) [11, 16, 17]. \n\n \n\n3.2 Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy    \n\nThe evolution of the acid-base reaction between the glass particles and the PAA \n\nwas followed by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The FTIR \n\nspectra were acquired on KBr pellets. For this purpose, 400 mg of KBr (Sigma-\n\nAldrich, >99 % trace metals basis) was mixed with 2-4 mg of sample in a mortar \n\nand pestle until forming an homogeneous mixture (Figure 5). This mixture was \n\nmoulded to a pellet using a press (Pike, USA). The FTIR spectra were acquired \n\non a Shimadzu IR-Prestige 21 spectrometer, under transmittance mode using a \n\nresolution of 4 cm-1, a range between 4400-400 cm-1 and 32 scans. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5: Preparation of the KBr pellets. \n\n \n\n3.3 X-ray powder Diffraction    \n\nThe crystalline/amorphous state of the synthesised glasses was evaluated using \n\nX-ray powder diffraction (XRD) [18]. The diffractograms were collected on a \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n44 \n\nBruker D8 Discover, operating with CuK radiation, in  ?/2? mode, between 6\u00ba and \n\n70\u00ba, with a step increment of 0.04\u00ba and an acquisition time of 1s per step. \n\n3.4 Scanning Electron Microscopy    \n\nScanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze the formation and \n\nmorphology of calcium phosphate layers (in vitro bioactivity) at the surface of the \n\ncements after immersion in SBF at 7 and 14 days (non-immersed samples were \n\nused as controls). The micrographs were collected on a Leica Cambridge S360 \n\nmicroscope using a beam energy of 15.0 kV and a working distance (WD) of 19 \n\nmm. All the analysed samples were previously coated with gold to enhance its \n\nconductivity (Figure 6). \n\n \nFigure 6: Gold deposition, microscope chamber and overall view of SEM microscope. \n\n \n\n3.5 Micro-Computed Tomography    \n\nThe cements samples were analysed by micro-Computed Tomography (micro-\n\nCT) in order to determine the polymer, glass and pore spatial distribution and \n\nvolume percentages. The collection of images was performed in a micro-CT \n\nSkyscan 1072 (Skyscan, Belgium) operating with a voltage of 104 kV and with a \n\ncurrent of 96 \u00b5A (Figure 7). Upon image acquisition the noise was reduced using \n\nnRecon software. Afterwards, 200 sliced images were obtained using the CT-An \n\nprogram. These images were used to produce a 3D reconstructions with the \n\nsame program (CT-An). Manipulating the image with a threshold of 40 to 80 for \n\nthe glass and 80 to 140 for the polymer it was possible to separate the \n\ncontribution of PAA and glass components to the cement volume, as well as the \n\nfree pore volume [19]. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n45 \n\n \n\nFigure 7: Micro-Computed Tomography equipment. \n\n \n\n3.6 Water uptake and weigh loss    \n\n3.6.1 Water uptake \n\nCement samples (prepared 24 h before testing to allow stabilization) were \n\nimmersed in Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) solution at a ratio of 1:15 (sample \n\nmass : PBS volume) and inserted in a shaking water bath maintained at 37 \u00baC \n\nand 60 rpm. In all the cases it was prepared three replicas of each sample that \n\nwere collected during the study. Cement samples were collected at various time \n\npoints (1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks) and were washed with distilled water. The \n\nexcess of water present in the surface of the cements was dried with paper and \n\nthen the cements were immediately weighted. \n\nThe water uptake (WU) was calculated using the following equation [20]: \n\n \n\nEquation 2 \n\nwhere, mtp is the mass of the wet specimen at a specific time point and mf is the \n\nmass of cement after drying at 37 \u00baC to constant weight. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n46 \n\n3.6.2 Weight loss \n\nThe weight loss (WL) was calculated during the water uptake (WU) tests. In the \n\nWL case, the cements were removed from the PBS solution at the same time \n\nintervals as the ones used for the WU (1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks) and were dried in \n\nthe oven, at 37 \u00baC, until constant weight. The percentage of WL was calculated \n\nusing the following equation: \n\n \n\nEquation 3 \n\nwhere, mf is the mass of the dried cement after its immersion in PBS and mi is \n\nthe mass of the dried cement before immersion in PBS. \n\n \n\n4.

Cement samples \n\n(including three replicas per formulation and time point) were collected at two \n\ntime points (7 and 14 days). The collected SBF solutions were filtered and stored \n\nin a controlled temperature room at 4 \u00baC until further analysis. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n48 \n\n4.3 Analysis of calcium and phosphorous concentration by \ninductive coupled plasma \u2013 optical emission spectroscopy    \n\nInductive coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was used to \n\ndetermine the calcium and phosphorous concentrations in the SBF solution \n\nbefore and after the immersion of the developed cements at 7 and 14 weeks \n\n(Figure 8). The higher ability of the cement to form a calcium phosphate layer in \n\nthe surface of the cement (a measure of its in vitro bioactivity), higher is the \n\nreduction of the calcium and phosphorous concentrations in the SBF. The \n\nanalytical methodology comprises the nebulisation of the SBF solutions into an \n\noven maintained at a temperature between 6000 and 10000 K to atomize the \n\nchemical compounds. Afterwards, the samples\u2019 absorption at specific \n\nwavelengths (? =422.67 nm for Ca and ? =213.62 nm for P) was measured and \n\nthe Ca and P concentrations were determined using calibration curves previously \n\nobtained with standard solutions (Alfa Aesar). \n\n \n\nFigure 8: ICP-OES analysis of the developed cements. \n\n \n\n4.4 Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy    \n\nThe Energy-dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) was used to analyse the \n\nsurface elemental composition of the prepared cement samples before and after \n\nimmersion in simulated body fluid (SBF) \u2013 bioactivity assays. For this purpose, a \n\nLink eXL-II Oxford spectroscope was used at an energy of 7.0 KeV. The EDS \n\nanalysis was used to quantify the calcium and phosphorous present in the \n\nsurface of the cements after immersion during 7 and 14 days in SBF. Prior to the \n\nanalysis the samples were carbon coated to improve their conductivity (Figure 9). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n49 \n\n   \n\nFigure 9: Carbon deposition of the analysed samples and EDS equipment. \n \n\n5. Degradation studies    \nThe kinetics and percentage of cement degradation are important parameters to \n\nevaluate their suitability as bone cements. In fact, it is expectable that the \n\ndeveloped cements will be slowly reabsorbed and excreted from the body. The \n\nkinetics of this process should match the formation of new bone so that the loss \n\nof the cementing effect of the reabsorbed part will not impart a reduction of \n\nproperties in the intervened portion of the bone. In this perspective, it was \n\nanalysed the kinetics and percentages of weight loss of the developed cements \n\n(see water uptake and weight loss in section 3 of this chapter). Additionally, the \n\ndegradation kinetics of the cements prepared with the addition of starch particles \n\nwere analysed in the presence of a starch-specific enzyme, ?-amylase. \n\n5.1 Enzymatic degradation \u2013 reducing sugars    \n\nThe degradation of the starch-containing cements was tested in the presence of \n\na starch-specific enzyme, ?-amylase. This enzyme is known to hydrolyse the ?-\n\n1,4-glycosidic linkages of polysaccharides (e.g. starch) to monosaccharides, \n\nsuch as, maltose and dextrins (scheme 1). \n\nO\n\nH\n\nOH\n\nH\n\nH\n\nOHH\n\nH\n\nOH\n\nO\n\nH\n\nO\n\nOH\n\nH\n\nH\n\nOOHH\n\nH\n\nHO\n\nn\n\namylase  \n\n \n\n \n\nScheme 1 \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n50 \n\nCement degradation was promoted by immersion of specimens in an enzyme \n\ncontaining solution (150 U/L) for different time periods, 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 \n\nweeks. At the specific time points, the solutions were analysed for the presence \n\nof reducing sugars. Their concentration was determined by the dinitrosalicylic \n\nacid (DNS) method. The 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid is converted to 3-amino-5-\n\nnitrosalicylic acid in alkaline conditions according to the reaction 1. \n\n \nOH\n\nOH\n\nNO2O2N\n\nO OH\n\nOH\n\nNH2O2N\n\nO\n\nNaOH\n\n \n\n \n\nReaction 1 \n\nThis last compound (3-amino-5-nitrosalicylic acid) forms a complex with the \n\nreducing sugars, which presents an absorption peak at 540 nm. All the \n\nimmersion solutions were analyzed in a UV-VIS spectrophotometer (microplate \n\nreader Synergie HT). Previous to the analysis a calibration curve was obtained \n\nusing standard solutions of dextrose (Sigma-Aldrich), allowing the determination \n\nof the concentration of reducing sugars present in the immersion solutions. \n\n6. Statistical methods    \n6.1 Dixon test (Q-test) \n\nThe Dixon test is an outlier test that informs if the minimum or the maximum \n\nvalue of a dataset from the same formulation may be rejected or not. The test is \n\nbased on equation 4 and 5 and was used in the datasets obtained from the \n\nmechanical analysis. \n\n \n\n, for the minimum value Equation 4 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n51 \n\n \n\n, for the maximum value Equation 5 \n\nWhere the data values are: x1, x2, x3 . . . xn-1, xn. \n\nConsidering a specific probability (in our case 95 %) the Qtabulated is selected from \n\nthe corresponding statistical table. If the Qcalculated<Qtabulated the value was not \n\nrejected within the given probability and if the Qcalculated>Qtabulated the value was \n\nrejected within the given probability. \n\n6.2 Normality test    \n\nAll the described statistics can only be applied if the datasets follow a normal \n\ndistribution. Considering this fact, all the datasets were tested for normality using \n\nthe Shapiro-Wilk analysis. This test indicates if the dataset is normally distributed \n\nat a 95 % probability. Considering the normal distribution, if the p-value was less \n\nthan 0.05, it was considered that the dataset was not significantly drawn from a \n\nnormally distributed population and if the p-value was higher than 0.05 the \n\ndataset was considered to be significantly drawn from a normally distributed \n\npopulation (Figure 10). All the tested datasets were in accordance with the \n\nnormal distribution making it possible to perform a significance test (t-test) [21]. \n\n \n\nFigure 10: Scheme of normal distribution (adapted by \n\nhttp://www.conferences.utah.edu/ishpssb/publicforum.html). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n52 \n\n6.3 t-test    \n\nWith the t-test it was possible to analyse if the differences between the averages \n\nof the datasets are significantly or not. The t-test was employed in the analysis of \n\nthe datasets obtained from the mechanical analysis, namely from the \n\ncompressive strength (CS) and modulus (CM) of the cements. A comparison of \n\nthe averages of the datasets is done considering a null hypothesis (mean1-\n\nmean2=0). From the results it was possible to conclude if the differences \n\nbetween the averages are significant or not within a 95 % probability. \n\n    \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n53 \n\n \nBibliography \n1.

We developed Al-free glasses of general \n\ncomposition 0.340SiO2: 0.300ZnO: (0.250-x-y)CaO: xSrO: yMgO: 0.050Na2O: \n\n0.060P2O5 (x, y = 0.000 or 0.125) and tested them for their cement forming \n\nability in the presence of polyacrylic acid (PAA) and water. The influence of the \n\ntype of cations present in the glass (Ca2+, Sr2+ and Mg2+); the PAA molecular \n\nweight (Mw) and the glass particle size in the cement final properties \n\n(mechanical behaviour and bioactivity) were evaluated. Enhanced compressive \n\nstrength (25\u00b15 MPa) and modulus (492\u00b117 MPa) was achieved with PAA of 50 \n\nkDa and glass particle sizes between 63-125 \u00b5m. The GICs\u2019 in vitro bioactivity \n\nwas tested in simulated body fluid (SBF) and their response analysed by ICP, \n\nSEM and EDS. Enhanced bioactivity was observed for glass composition \n\nx=0.125; y=0.000, presenting a surface calcium (Ca)/ phosphorous (P) ratio of \n\n1.6 (similar to hydroxylapatite) and a surface morphology consistent with a CaP \n\ncoating. Starch was added to the cement formulation x=0.125; y=0.000 (at \n\n0.050 and 0.250 weight proportions) in order to enhance its biodegradability \n\n(tested by immersion in phosphate buffer saline in the presence of ?-amylase). \n\nThe results obtained from the determination of the reducing sugars in the \n\ndegradation solution indicate that starch only starts to degrade after 8 weeks of \n\nimmersion. Our studies indicate that it is possible to formulate Al-free GIC \n\ncompositions with potential to be used as bone cements. \n\n \n\nKeywords: glass ionomer cements, bone cements, mechanical properties, \n\nbioactive, biodegradable  \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III \u2013 Aluminum-free glass ionomer bone cements with enhanced bioactivity and biodegradability \n\n \n\n59 \n\n \n\n1. Introduction \n\nWilson and Kent created the first glass-ionomer cement (GIC), in the early \n\n1970s [1, 2]. GICs are prepared through the mixing of a glass powder, usually a \n\ncalcium fluoroaluminosilicate, with polyacrylic acid (PAA) and water. The curing \n\nreactions usually occur in two phases designated as gelation and maturation \n\n[3]. During gelation the acidic PAA attacks the glass particles at their basic \n\nsites, promoting the release of cations, e.g. 5-coordinated and 6-coordinated \n\naluminium (Al) in the ionic form Al3+, Ca2+, etc., from the glass to the cement \n\nmatrix [4]. This process is followed by the maturation phase that includes the \n\nleaching of covalently bounded 4-coordinated Al (slower process due to its \n\nmore stable position in the glass structure) and the ionic cross-linking of the \n\nPAA chains by the leached cations. These two cements curing phases \n\ngenerates the final GIC structure - a composite of cross-linked PAA reinforced \n\nwith the reacted glass particles [5]. \n\nInitial application of this type of cements was in dentistry due to their unique \n\nproperties, namely, its strong adhesion to the hydroxylapatite present in dentin \n\nand its anti-cariogenic potential [1, 6-8]. Initial drawbacks of conventional GICs \n\ncomprised, e.g. sensitivity to moisture during initial hardening, poor mechanical \n\nproperties, among others. Optimization of their formulations resulted in \n\nconventional and modified GICs (e.g. resin-modified GICs) with enhanced \n\nbehaviour [9, 10]. GICs continue to be mainly applied in the dentistry field, \n\nalthough, some tests have been made to use them as bone cements. These \n\nattempts revealed to be unsuccessful due to Al cytotoxicity present in the glass \n\ncomposition and in the cement matrix [11, 12]. More recently, a series of studies \n\n[13-15] have been dedicated to eliminate Al from the cement formulation in \n\norder to avoid its deleterious cytotoxic effect. In fact, Towler and co-workers \n\nalready shown that Al-free glass particles of the ternary system calcium-zinc-\n\nsilicates [16] and quaternary system calcium-strontium-zinc-silicates [17, 18] \n\npossess cement-forming ability. These glass compositions always included low \n\ncalcium/strontium fractions (cumulative values below 0.16) limiting the glass \n\nreactivity towards the PAA. In this study we hypothesise that: 1) the increase of \n\nthe glass basic sites might increment the glass reactivity inducing an \n\nenhancement of the GIC mechanical behaviour; 2) the inclusion of higher \n\nfractions of CaO/SrO/MgO might improve the GIC in vitro bioactivity; 3) it is \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III \u2013 Aluminum-free glass ionomer bone cements with enhanced bioactivity and biodegradability \n\n \n\n60 \n\n \n\nexpectable that the type of divalent cations (group II) included in the glass \n\nformulations (i.e. Ca2+, Sr2+ and Mg2+) will influence the cement final properties \n\n(e.g. mechanical behaviour, bioactivity, etc.); and 4) the addition of starch to the \n\ncement formulation improves the GIC biodegradability. \n\n \n\n2. Materials and methods \n\n2.1 Materials \u2013 Glass synthesis \n\nGlass formulations of general formula 0.340SiO2: 0.300ZnO: (0.250-x-y)CaO: \n\nxSrO: yMgO: 0.050Na2O: 0.060P2O5 (where x and y = 0.125 or 0.000) were \n\nprepared by melt quenching using appropriate proportions of glass precursors \n\n(Table 1). For this purpose, silica (Merck), zinc oxide (Sigma), magnesium oxide \n\n(Sigma, 98 %), calcium carbonate (Sigma, 99 %), strontium carbonate (Sigma, \n\n98 %), sodium hidrogenocarbonate (Riedel de-Haen, 99.7 %) and diamonnium \n\nhidrogenophosphate (Sigma, 98 %) were grounded with a pestle and mortar \n\ntransferred to a crucible and fired to 300 \u00baC to release ammonia, 650 \u00baC to allow \n\nthe release of carbon dioxide and to 1300 \u00baC to produce the melt. \n\n \n\nTable 1: Composition of the synthesized glass formulations (mol %). \n\nComponent G1* G2 G3 G4 G5 G6 \n\nSiO2 0.340 0.340 0.340 0.340 0.340 0.340 \n\nZnO 0.300 0.300 0.300 0.300 0.300 0.300 \n\nMgO 0.250 - - 0.125 - 0.125 \n\nCaO - 0.250 - 0.125 0.125 - \n\nSrO - - 0.250 - 0.125 0.125 \n\nNa2O 0.050 0.050 0.050 0.050 0.050 0.050 \n\nP2O5 0.060 0.060 0.060 0.060 0.060 0.060 \n\n*G1 \u2013 Not possible to produce an homogeneous melt under the used experimental conditions. \n\n \n\nGlass blocks were immersed in liquid nitrogen and grounded with a pestle and \n\nmortar. The glass particles were separated by size using an Analytical Sieve \n\nShaker (Retsch AS200) for 5 min at 60 rpm. With this procedure it was possible \n\nto collect three different fractions (with particle of sizes&lt;63 \u00b5m, between 63-125 \n\n\u00b5m and between 125-250 \u00b5m) for each glass composition. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III \u2013 Aluminum-free glass ionomer bone cements with enhanced bioactivity and biodegradability \n\n \n\n61 \n\n \n\n2.2 Cement preparation \n\nCements were prepared mixing the glass powder with PAA and water at \n\nappropriate proportion (55: 21: 24 by mass). PAA of different molecular weights \n\n(Mws) were tested, namely, 50 kDa (PolySciences); 450 kDa (Sigma-Aldrich) \n\nand 1250 kDa (Sigma-Aldrich). The cement formulation that presented higher \n\nmechanical performance was modified to enhance its biodegradability. To this \n\npurpose it was added corn starch (Sigma) to formulations in weight percentages \n\nof 5 % and 25 %. All the cement pastes (immediately after mixing) were shaped \n\nin a Teflon mould to produce cylindrical specimens of 6 mm diameter and 11 \n\nmm height. \n\n \n\n2.3 Glass and cement characterization \n\n2.3.1 X-Ray Diffraction \n\nThe crystalline/amorphous state of the synthesized glass formulations was \n\nevaluated by x-ray powder diffraction (XRD). Diffractograms were collected on a \n\nBruker D8 Discover, operating with Cu K? radiation, in ?/2? mode, between 6\u00b0 \n\nand 70\u00b0, with a step increment of 0.04\u00b0 and an acqu isition time of 1 s per step. \n\n2.3.2 Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy \n\n The Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra of the glasses and cements \n\nwere collected using KBr (Sigma, 99%+) pellets on a Shimadzu IR-Prestige 21 \n\nspectrometer under transmittance mode, between 4400-400 cm-1, using a \n\nresolution of 4 cm-1 and 32 scans. \n\n2.3.3 Mechanical testing \n\n The compressive strength (CS) and modulus (CM) of the cements were \n\nevaluated. The developed cement formulations were mechanically tested under \n\ncompression loading on an Instron 5540 (Instron, USA) using a 1 kN load cell \n\nand 2 mm/min of crosshead speed. Six cylindrical specimens of each \n\nformulation were tested 1 day after preparation. The specimen compressive \n\nstrength (CS) was calculated according to equation 1: \n\n \n\n(1) \n\nwhere ? is the maximum applied load (N) and d is the diameter of the sample \n\n(mm). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III \u2013 Aluminum-free glass ionomer bone cements with enhanced bioactivity and biodegradability \n\n \n\n62 \n\n \n\nThe compressive modulus (CM) was calculated as the initial slope (elastic \n\nregime) of the stress-strain curves of each cement specimen. \n\nAverages were calculated for the CS and CM of each cement formulation \n\nand the normality of the data distribution was confirmed using the Shapiro-Wilk \n\ntest. Significant differences (95 % probability) between the cement formulations \n\nwere calculated using the t-test. \n\n \n\n2.4 Bioactivity tests \n\n2.4.1 In vitro bioactivity \n\n Cement formulations were immersed in Simulated Body Fluid (SBF, prepared \n\naccording to a previously established procedure [14]) during 7 and 14 days. At \n\nthese specific time points, the specimens were collected from the solutions. The \n\ncalcium (Ca) and phosphorous (P) concentrations of the initial SBF and \n\nimmersion solutions were analyzed by Inductive Coupled Plasma \u2013 Optical \n\nEmission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and the elemental composition and \n\nmorphology of the immersed and non-immersed cement surfaces were \n\nevaluated by Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Scanning \n\nElectron Microscopy (SEM). \n\n2.4.2 Inductive coupled plasma \u2013 optical emission spectroscopy \n\nICP-OES was used to determine the Ca and P concentrations in the SBF \n\nsolutions before and after the immersion of the developed cements. The \n\nsamples\u2019 absorption at specific wavelengths (? =422.67 nm for Ca and \n\n? =213.62 nm for P) was measured and the Ca and P concentrations were \n\ndetermined from the calibration curves previously obtained with standard \n\nsolutions (Alfa Aesar). \n\n2.4.3 Energy-Dispersive x-ray Spectroscopy \n\n The Energy-Dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was used to quantify the \n\nCa and P present in the surface of the cements. A Link eXL-II Oxford \n\nSpectroscope was used at an energy of 7.0 keV and the samples were carbon \n\ncoated to improve their conductivity. \n\n2.4.4 Scanning Electron Microscopy \n\n Micrographs of the cement samples were collected on a Leica Cambridge \n\nS360 microscope using a beam energy of 15.0 kV and a working distance (WD) \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III \u2013 Aluminum-free glass ionomer bone cements with enhanced bioactivity and biodegradability \n\n \n\n63 \n\n \n\nof 19 mm. All the samples were previously coated with gold and the morphology \n\nof the CaP layers was verified after 7 and 14 days of immersion in SBF. \n\n \n\n2.5 Water uptake and weigh loss \n\nCement samples (prepared 24 h before testing) were immersed in Phosphate \n\nBuffer Saline (PBS) solution at a ratio of 1:15 (sample mass: PBS volume) and \n\ninserted in a shaking water bath maintained at 37 \u00baC and 60 rpm. Cement \n\nsamples were collected at various time points (1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks). They \n\nwere washed with distilled water, the excess water present in the surface was \n\ndried with paper and the samples were immediately weighted. The water uptake \n\n(WU) was calculated using the equation 2. \n\n \n\n \n(2) \n \n\nwhere, mtp is the wet mass at the specific time point and mf is the mass of \n\ncement after drying at 37 \u00baC to constant weight. \n\nThe weight loss (WL) was calculated during the water uptake (WU) tests. In \n\nthe WL case, the cements were removed from the PBS solution at the same \n\ntime intervals as the ones used for the WU (1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks) and were \n\ndried into the oven, at 37 \u00baC, until constant weight. The percentage of WL was \n\ncalculated using the equation 3. \n\n \n\n \n(3) \n \n\nwhere, mf is the mass of the dried cement after its immersion in PBS and mi is \n\nthe mass of the cement before immersion in PBS. \n\n \n\n2.6 Degradation tests  \n\nThe degradation of the starch-containing cements was tested in the presence \n\nof a starch-specific enzyme, ?-amylase. This enzyme is known to hydrolyse the \n\n?-1,4-glycosidic linkages of polysaccharides (e.g. starch) to monosaccharides, \n\nsuch as, maltose and dextrins. \n\nCement degradation was promoted by immersion of specimens in an enzyme \n\ncontaining solution (150 U/L) for different time periods, 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III \u2013 Aluminum-free glass ionomer bone cements with enhanced bioactivity and biodegradability \n\n \n\n64 \n\n \n\nweeks. At the specific time points, the solutions were analysed for the presence \n\nof reducing sugars. Their concentration was determined by the dinitrosalicylic \n\nacid (DNS) method. The 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid is converted to 3-amino-5-\n\nnitrosalicylic acid in alkaline conditions. This last compound (3-amino-5-\n\nnitrosalicylic acid) forms a complex with the reducing sugars, which presents an \n\nabsorption peak at 540 nm. All the immersion solutions were analyzed in a UV-\n\nVIS spectrophotometer (microplate reader Synergie HT). Previous to the \n\nanalysis a calibration curve was obtained using standard solutions of dextrose \n\n(Sigma-Aldrich, nd), allowing the determination of the concentration of reducing \n\nsugars present in the immersion solutions. \n\n \n\n2.7 Micro-Computed Tomography \n\nThe cement samples were analysed by micro-Computed Tomography (micro-\n\nCT) in order to determine the polymer, glass and pore spatial distributions and \n\nvolume percentages. The collection of images was performed in a micro-CT \n\nSkyscan 1072 (Skyscan, Belgium) operating with a voltage of 104 kV and with a \n\ncurrent of 96 \u00b5A. Upon image acquisition the noise was reduced using nRecon \n\nsoftware. Afterwards, 200 sliced images were obtained using the CT-An \n\nprogram. These images were used to produce a 3D reconstruction with the \n\nsame program (CT-An). Manipulating the image with a threshold of 40 to 80 for \n\nthe glass and 80 to 140 for the polymer it was possible to separate the \n\ncontribution of these components to the cement volume, as well as the free \n\npore volume. \n\n \n3. Results and discussion \n\n3.1 Glass characterization \n\n3.1.1 X-Ray Diffraction \n\nThe XRD diffractograms of all the synthesised glass compositions presents \n\nthe predominance of the amorphous state with a low contribution of crystalline \n\nphases only in the cases of samples G4 and G6 (see Figure 1). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III \u2013 Aluminum-free glass ionomer bone cements with enhanced bioactivity and biodegradability \n\n \n\n65 \n\n \n\n10 20 30 40 50\n\nG4\n\n2?

Chemical characterization \n\n FTIR spectra of the cement samples (cured during 24 h) were used to \n\ncharacterize their curing reactions and chemical structure. As an example, \n\nFigure 2 presents the FTIR spectra of PAA, glass G5 and cement C5. \n\n2000 1800 1600 1400 1200 1000 800\n\nC5\n\nPAA\n\nWavenumber (cm\n-1\n)\n\nG5\n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2: FTIR spectra of PAA, glass G5 and cement C5 \n\n  \nIt is known that the cement curing reactions comprises an acid attack \n\npromoted by the PAA carboxylic acids on the surface layer of the glass particles \n\nthat partially leaches its cations to the cement matrix. These leached cations \n\ncrosslink the polymeric chains (at the COO- groups from the PAA) through the \n\nformation of ionic linkages [3]. In fact, the PAA, glass and cement FTIR spectra \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III \u2013 Aluminum-free glass ionomer bone cements with enhanced bioactivity and biodegradability \n\n \n\n66 \n\n \n\n(Figure 2) are consistent with this reaction model. Upon acid attack the PAA \n\nCOOH stretching at 1750 cm-1 (observed before the curing reaction) is shifted \n\nto two peaks (symmetric and asymmetric stretching between 1640 cm-1 and \n\n1550 cm-1) of its ionized form (COO-). \n\n \n\n3.2.2 Mechanical testing \n\na) Influence of glass particle size and PAA molecular weight on the cement \n\nmechanical behaviour. \n\n The influence of the glass particle size and the PAA molecular weight (Mw) \n\non the mechanical behaviour of the cement (CS and CM) was also studied. To \n\nthis purpose, three glass powder fractions (using G5) with different particle size \n\ndistributions were obtained by sieving (i.e.&lt;63 \u00b5m; 63 \u00b5m<x<125 \u00b5m and 125 \n\n\u00b5m<x<250 \u00b5m) and three PAA samples of different Mws (50 kDa, 450 kDa and \n\n1250 kDa) were tested. The CS and CM values obtained with the cements \n\nprepared with the sieved glass powders and the PAA samples of different Mw \n\nare presented in Figure 3.  \n\n<63 63-125 125-250\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\nC\no\nm\n\np\nre\n\nss\niv\n\ne\n M\n\no\nd\nu\nlu\n\ns \n(M\n\nP\na\n)\n\nParticle size (\u00b5m)\n\n Mw (PAA) = 50kDa\n Mw (PAA) = 450kDa\n Mw (PAA) = 1250kDa\n\n<63 63-125 125-250\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nC\no\nm\n\np\nre\n\nss\niv\n\ne\n s\n\ntr\ne\n\nn\ng\nth\n\n (\nM\n\nP\na\n\n)\n\nParticle size (\u00b5m)\n\n Mw (PAA) = 50kDa\n Mw (PAA) = 450kDa\n Mw (PAA) = 1250kDa\n\n \nFigure 3: Compressive modulus (CM) and compressive strength (CS) of the cements \n\nprepared with the different particle sizes of glass powder and PAA Mws. \n \n\nHigher CS and CM values were obtained using PAA of 50 kDa and glass \n\nparticle sizes between 63 \u00b5m and 125 \u00b5m. In all the cases, when the glass \n\nparticle size distribution or PAA Mw deviated from these optimal conditions, CM \n\ndecreased significantly. In the case of the CS, not always it was observed a \n\nsignificant decrease, although, it was clear that the above mentioned optimal \n\nconditions yielded a cement formulation with enhanced CS [19, 20]. \n\nIt was observed that a proper mixing of the cement paste would necessitate \n\nmore water when the glass particle sizes are&lt;63 \u00b5m. Although, other reports \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III \u2013 Aluminum-free glass ionomer bone cements with enhanced bioactivity and biodegradability \n\n \n\n67 \n\n \n\n[21] suggest that lower particle sizes would be beneficial for the cement \n\nmechanical properties. From our results it is possible to conclude that this \n\nrelation is not universal and that the optimal glass particle sizes might vary with \n\nthe glass composition. In fact, it is reasonable to assume that the higher the \n\nreactivity of the glass particles the higher should be the glass particle sizes (and \n\nconsequently lower the surface area). If low particle sizes are used on glasses \n\nwith high reactivity towards PAA their reaction is so fast that it is not possible to \n\nproduce an homogeneous cement paste. In these cases the cement\u2019s working \n\ntime is too short to allow its application in the cementation of bone and to yield \n\nenhanced mechanical performance. \n\n \n\nb) Influence of the composition of each cement in the mechanical behaviour \n\n In Figure 4 is presented the CM and CS obtained for the cement \n\nformulations prepared using the synthesised glasses (with particle size between \n\n63 and 125 \u00b5m), PAA (50 kDa) and water.  \n\nC2 C3 C4 C5 C6\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\nC\no\n\nm\np\n\nre\nss\n\niv\ne\n\n M\no\n\nd\nu\n\nlu\ns \n\n(M\nP\n\na\n)\n\nCements\n\n \n\n \n\nC2 C3 C4 C5 C6\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nC\no\nm\n\np\nre\n\nss\niv\n\ne\n s\n\ntr\ne\nn\n\ng\nth\n\n (\nM\n\nP\na\n)\n\nCements\n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4: Compressive modulus (CM) and compressive strength (CS) of the developed \n\ncements. \n \n\nAnalysing the results obtained for the CM values it is clear the existence of \n\ntwo groups of formulations: group 1 composed by C4 and C6 that present lower \n\nCM; and group 2 composed by C2, C3 and C5 that exhibit higher CM. No \n\nsignificant differences were observed within each group, although, significant \n\nvariations (95 % probability) were observed between the samples of the two \n\ngroups. It is interesting to notice that lower CM is obtained for the cements \n\nprepared with glasses that presented MgO in the composition. \n\nThe mechanical analysis was complemented with the determination of the \n\nCS of the same cement formulations. From the three cements that presented \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III \u2013 Aluminum-free glass ionomer bone cements with enhanced bioactivity and biodegradability \n\n \n\n68 \n\n \n\nhigher CM (C2, C3 and C5) the only one that presented a significantly higher \n\nmechanical resistance was C5. Overall, it presented a CM of 492\u00b117 MPa and \n\na CS of 25\u00b15 MPa. \n\n \n\n3.2.3 In vitro bioactivity \n\n The ability of the cements to promote the formation of calcium phosphate \n\n(CaP) layers on their surface (in the presence of SBF) was used as a measure \n\nof their in vitro bioactivity. At a first stage cement samples were immersed in \n\nSBF for 7 and 14 days. ICP-OES was used to monitor the Ca and P \n\nconcentration in the SBF solution before and after the cement immersion. Table \n\n2 summarizes the Ca and P concentrations as percentage of the concentration \n\nin the original SBF. \n\n \n\nTable 2: Ca and P concentrations in the SBF solutions after 7 and 14 days of \n\nimmersion of GIC samples.

The larger variations on the Ca were observed \n\nfor C3 and C6, although, these are not accompanied by the P concentrations. In \n\nfact, the reduction in the P (concentrations between 40 % and 63 %) are \n\nlevelled in all the cement formulations. In this case it is not noticed any specific \n\ntrends. \n\n ICP-OES of the immersion solution is an indirect method to determine the \n\nability of the cements to produce CaP. The direct analysis of the elemental \n\ncomposition of the surfaces of the cements (after immersion in SBF for 7 and 14 \n\ndays) was done using EDS (Figure 5).  \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III \u2013 Aluminum-free glass ionomer bone cements with enhanced bioactivity and biodegradability \n\n \n\n69 \n\n \n\n2 3 4 5\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nP\n\nCa\n\nC\no\n\nu\nn\n\nts\n (\n\nx1\n0\n\n2\n)\n\nRange (KeV)\n\n 0 days\n 7 days\n 14 days\n\nCa\n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5: EDS spectra the surface of cement C5 immersed in SBF for 7 and 14 days \n\n(spectrum of non-immersed cement shown as reference \u2013 0 days). \n \n\nFrom the EDS spectra it was possible to collect the Ca and P concentrations \n\nin the cement surfaces (Table 3). It is known that biomaterials with high \n\nbioactivity present thicker CaP layers and these layers present the \n\nhydroxyapatite crystalline form. It is also known that the Ca/P ratio for \n\nhydroxyapatite is, approximately, 1.62 [22, 23]. In this perspective, the closer \n\nthe Ca/P ratio is to the hydroxyapatite ratio the higher is the bioactivity of the \n\ncement. Under this assumption, the cement sample C5 presented Ca/P ratios of \n\n1.8 and 1.6 at 7 and 14 days of immersion in SBF, respectively. From all the \n\ntested formulations, the C5 Ca/P values were the closest to hydroxyapatite, \n\nbeing considered as the one that presented highest bioactivity. \n\n \nTable 3: Ca/P ratio of all cements after 7 and 14 days. \n\nCement \n7 days 14 days \n\nCa P Ca/P Ca P Ca/P \nC2 0.83 1.20 0.70 2.30 1.97 1.17 \nC3 1.20 1.24 0.97 1.88 1.31 1.43 \nC4 1.48 0.99 1.49 0.79 1.14 0.70 \nC5 1.26 0.70 1.79 2.19 1.42 1.55 \nC6 0.53 0.74 0.71 0.45 0.58 0.77 \nCa/P of hydroxyapatite 1.62. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III \u2013 Aluminum-free glass ionomer bone cements with enhanced bioactivity and biodegradability \n\n \n\n70 \n\n \n\n In order to complement the analysis, SEM was used to monitor the \n\nmorphology of the CaP layers (cement C5 presented in Figure 6 as an \n\nexample). \n\n \nFigure 6: SEM micrographs of cement C5 before and after immersion in SBF for 7 and \n\n14 days. \n \n\n SEM analysis demonstrated the change in the cement morphology upon SBF \n\nimmersion. Before immersion the cement surface is smooth without CaP \n\ncrystals, while after 7 and 14 days of immersion it is possible to observe the \n\nformation of CaP layers that in some cases present the cauliflower form, \n\ncharacteristic of hydroxyapatite. \n\n Considering the in vitro bioactivity and mechanical testing results it was clear \n\nthat cement C5 exhibited properties that best match their use as bone cement. \n\nIn this perspective, this composition was selected for subsequent analysis and \n\ntesting. \n\n \n\n3.2.4 3D distribution of glass, PAA and porosity of C5 cement \n\n Micro-CT was used to obtain the spatial distribution of the glass particles, \n\nPAA and porosity of the cement sample that exhibited higher mechanical \n\nperformance and bioactivity (C5). \n\n The analysis of the C5 micrographs (Figure 8) indicates a higher \n\npredominance of PAA in the surface of the cement than in the bulk. This is \n\nassigned to the moulding process executed for all the formulations before the \n\nanalysis. Additionally, using the micrographs it was possible to determine the \n\nporosity of the cement samples. In the case of cement C5 it was calculated a \n\nporosity of, approximately, 35 % in volume.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III \u2013 Aluminum-free glass ionomer bone cements with enhanced bioactivity and biodegradability \n\n \n\n71 \n\n \n\n3.2.5 Water uptake and weight loss \n\nThe cement that presented higher mechanical performance and bioactivity \n\n(C5) was again chosen to study the water uptake and weight loss of this type of \n\ncement formulations. In this case, C5 presented an initial water uptake of 22 % \n\nthat stabilised 1 week after immersion, reaching a plateau between 22 % and \n\n25 % during all the subsequent time period (12 weeks) (Figure 9 and Figure \n\n10). \n\n \n\n3.3 Addition of starch to the cement formulation  \n\n3.3.1 Mechanical testing \n\nCement sample C5 was prepared with two different percentages of starch (5 \n\n% and 25 %).

In the case of CM this decrease is limited to, \n\napproximately, 20 % when 5 % of starch is added, although, when higher \n\npercentages of starch are used the reduction of CM is higher than 65 %. CS is \n\nmore sensitive to the inclusion of starch. In fact, the addition of 5 % of starch \n\nproduced a decrease of, approximately, 50 % of the CS of the initial cement \n\nformulation. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III \u2013 Aluminum-free glass ionomer bone cements with enhanced bioactivity and biodegradability \n\n \n\n72 \n\n \n\n3.3.2 3D distribution of the glass, polymers and porosity on the starch-\n\ncontaining cements \n\nThe 3D micrograph of the C5 cement with 0 %, 5 % and 25 % of starch is \n\npresented in Figure 8. It is clearly noticed a reduction of the PAA domains \n\n(lighter regions) in the surface of the cement with the increase of starch content. \n\nIn fact, it was observed an increase of viscosity of the cement paste with the \n\naddition of starch. Under these conditions it is expectable a lower mobility of the \n\nPAA during the moulding process, limiting its diffusion to the surface of the \n\ncement. \n\nC5 without starch \n\nC5 with 5% of starch \n\n   C5 with 25% of starch \n\n \n\nFigure 8: Micro-CT bidimensional image and 3D image of C5 cement without starch \nand with 5 % and 25 % of starch. \n\n \n\nWith the acquired micrographs it was also possible to determine the porosity \n\nof the cement samples. The inclusion of starch into the cement formulation \n\nproduced an increase of porosity from, approximately, 35 %  to 43 %. It is clear \n\nthat the packing of the starch particles within the cement structure induces the \n\nappearance of a significant free-volume that is the responsible for the increment \n\nof the cement porosity. When the starch percentage was increased from 5 % to \n\n25 % no significant variations in the porosity was observed. In fact, the porosity \n\nis maintained within the 41 % and 42 % range. \n\n \n\n3.3.3 Water uptake and weight loss \n\n The WU and WL of the C5 cement with 0 %, 5 % and 25 % of starch was \n\ndetermined through the immersion of the cement samples in PBS (at the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III \u2013 Aluminum-free glass ionomer bone cements with enhanced bioactivity and biodegradability \n\n \n\n73 \n\n \n\nphysiological pH, 7.4) during different time periods (up to 12 weeks). The \n\nsolution pH value was monitored throughout the experiment. It was observed a \n\nreduction of the pH from the initial 7.4 to 7.0. This result was attributed to the \n\npartial solubilisation of the PAA present in the cement formulations. \n\n In relation to the WU all the cements presented a similar general trend.

The inclusion \n\nof starch in the cement composition increased the hydrophilicity of the cements \n\nand their WU values change from, approximately, 25 % (C5 without starch) to \n\n28 % (C5+5 % starch) and 35 % (C5+25 % starch).

When the same formulations were immersed in PBS solution \n\nin the presence of ?-amylase it was expectable to observe a higher decrease of \n\nWLs in the starch containing formulations.

Under these not expectable results, it is \n\nrelevant to evaluate if the starch is actually degrading into reducing sugars or \n\nnot. \n\n3.3.4 Degradation tests \n\nStarch was added to cement C5 in order to enhance the cement \n\ndegradability, although, WL studies under enzymatic medium showed that the \n\ncement WLs were diminished.

Until this time point it they appear to be \n\nentrapped in the GIC structure without any connection with the immersion \n\nsolution. \n\nConsidering the increasing of the concentration of reducing sugars in the \n\nenzymatic medium (after the 8th week of immersion) there is a clear indication \n\nthat the addition of starch to the GIC formulations induces an enhanced \n\nbiodegradability at a larger timeframe than expectable. \n\n \n\n4. Conclusions \n\n Our results demonstrate that it was possible to prepare Al-free glass-ionomer \n\ncement formulations using glasses of general formula 0.340SiO2: 0.300ZnO: \n\n(0.250-x-y)CaO: xSrO: yMgO: 0.050Na2O: 0.060P2O5 (where x and y = 0.000 or \n\n0.125). The inclusion of MgO revealed not appropriate for the achievement of \n\ncement with enhanced mechanical performance and bioactivity. Although, the \n\ncombination of SrO and CaO (G5, x= 0.125; y= 0.000) produced a glass \n\ncomposition that generated cements with enhanced mechanical performance \n\n(CS=25\u00b15 MPa and CM=492\u00b117 MPa) and bioactivity (Ca/P= 1.6), with limited \n\nWU (approximately, 20 %) and WL (approximately, 13 %).  \n\nThe optimized C5 cement formulation presented porosities in the range of 35 \n\n% that could be increased to 43 % with the inclusion of starch in the cement \n\nformulation. Moreover, the presence of reducing sugars in the enzymatic \n\ndegradation solution after 8 weeks of testing indicates the existence of \n\nimproved biodegradability at a longer timeframe than expected. \n\nOur work demonstrates that it is possible to design Al-free glass-ionomer \n\ncement formulations that exhibit suitable mechanical performance and \n\nbioactivity. The elimination of the Al from the glass generates cement \n\nformulations suitable to be used as bone cements.

Their \n\nmechanical performance was evaluated yielding compressive strengths (CS) \n\nand moduli (CM) between 11 MPa - 25 MPa and 227 MPa \u2013 492 MPa, \n\nrespectively. Highest results (CS = 25 MPa; CM = 492 MPa) were obtained with \n\nglass composition 0.340SiO2 : 0.300ZnO : 0.125CaO : 0.125SrO : 0.050Na2O : \n\n0.060P2O5, a glass particle size between 63 \u00b5m<x<125 \u00b5m and a PAA Mw of 50 \n\nkDa. \n\nThe PAA and glass distribution within the GIC samples was studied by micro-\n\nCT, revealing that the PAA is mainly in the outer surface of the GICs while the \n\nreacted glass particles are homogeneous distributed throughout its bulk. This \n\nPAA migration to the surface of the samples may be a consequence of the \n\npressures promoted by the moulding process. Additionally, this observation is \n\nalso consistent with the higher mobility of the PAA (compared to the glass \n\nparticles) within the cement paste before final curing. \n\nThe in vitro bioactivity of the developed GICs was evaluated by a series of \n\ntechniques (ICP of the immersion SBF solutions and EDS/SEM of the cement \n\nsurface before and after immersion). In all the cases they demonstrated the \n\nGICs\u2019 ability to promote the formation of a calcium phosphate layer at their \n\nsurface. \n\nFinally, in an attempt to impart biodegradability to the GICs, they were \n\nformulated with the addition of starch at weight percentages of 5% and 25%. \n\nThe porosity of the developed starch containing GICs (determined by micro-CT) \n\nwas in the range of 35% to 43%. Additionally, when no enzyme was used in the \n\nimmersion solutions the samples\u2019 WL were similar to the control sample (0% \n\nstarch), although, unexpectedly, when an enzymatic medium was used a lower \n\nWL was recorded. A possible explanation for the lower WL observed with the \n\nsamples subject to enzymatic medium is related with the inhibition of the \n\nprocesses that induce the WL of the GICs (e.g. 0% starch). These processes \n\nmight comprise the partial solubilisation of PAA and leaching of cations from the \n\nglass particles and cement matrix to the immersion solution. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV \u2013 General conclusions &amp; Future research \n\n \n\n82 \n\n \n\nUnder these circumstances it was not possible to conclude about the starch \n\ncontaining GICs degradation from the observed WLs. In this perspective, the \n\ndetermination of the concentration of reducing sugars was executed and \n\nconfirmed their increasing presence after 8 weeks of immersion. These results \n\nprovided evidence that the starch degraded at a longer timeframe than \n\nexpectable. \n\nIn general, the results showed that it is possible to formulate aluminium-free \n\nGICs with mechanical behaviour suitable to be used as bone cements in non \n\nload-bearing sites. The developed GICs presented significant bioactivity giving \n\na good indication on their suitability for in vitro and/or in vivo testing. The \n\ninclusion of starch to the cement formulations imparted degradability in the \n\nGICs (supported by the occurrence of reducing sugars in the degradation \n\nenzymatic solution), although, the reduction of the WL when enzymatic medium \n\nwas used requires further evaluation to understand the mechanisms involved in \n\nthe degradation/solubilisation processes. \n\nThe work executed under this thesis resulted in promising perspectives for the \n\nbiological testing of the developed GIC formulations in vitro and/or in vivo. \n\nUnder this perspective it is relevant to project as future work the evaluation of \n\ntheir cytotoxicity. Initial in vitro procedure should comprise indirect contact \n\nmethod [1-3]. Afterwards, and still under in vitro testing, it is highly relevant to \n\nevaluate the suitability of the developed bone cements within similar conditions \n\nthan the ones that it will face on its application site. For this purpose, it is \n\nrelevant to evaluate the behavior of osteoblasts (one of the main type of cells \n\nresponsible for osteogenesis) in the presence of cement specimens. \n\nThe outcome of the in vitro biological testing is determinant to define the \n\nfollowing research steps. In this sense, if positive results are obtained from the \n\nin vitro testing, it is relevant to initiate in vivo testing; if negative results are \n\nobtained, the research should come back to the formulation stage with \n\noptimization of the glass composition or the polymeric part. \n\nAnother section that is opened to optimization is the PAA component. In fact, it \n\nis known that its high acidity induces pH reduction in the surrounding tissue, \n\npromoting inflammatory response. Its substitution by different types of polymeric \n\nacids is a valuable alternative that requires evaluation. Some of these \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV \u2013 General conclusions &amp; Future research \n\n \n\n83 \n\n \n\nalternatives can be polysaccharide-based due to their known biocompatibility \n\nand in some cases bioactivity. Examples of these polymers are hyaluronic acid \n\nor carboxymethyl chitosan [4, 5]. \n\nThe analysis of the reducing sugars, present in the degradation solution of the \n\nstarch containing GICs, revealed that starch degradation only starts after the 8th \n\nweek of degradation (within a 12 weeks study). In this perspective it is also \n\nrelevant to test the degradability of the same starch containing GICs at a longer \n\ntime frame. \n\nFinally, the application of bone cements within the clinical domain requires \n\nstrategies that enable versatility and simplicity of application to the clinician. In \n\nthis perspective, it is relevant to evaluate the suitability of the developed \n\nformulations as injectable bone cement (one of the most used application \n\nsystems). Under this approach, the optimization of the GIC formulation might be \n\nrequired in order to better control their setting time (the time that ranges from \n\nthe start of mixing and the lost of cement moldability) [6-12]. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV \u2013 General conclusions &amp; Future research \n\n \n\n84 \n\n \n\nBibliography \n\n1.
