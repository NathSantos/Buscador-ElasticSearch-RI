Samples of ore\nand also of the minerals sphalerite, galena, pyrite, and dolomite were selected for the experiments. Nine\ntypes of dispersing agents and six blends among them were employed.\n\nA set of three dispersing agents was selected for the lead flotation and another set of three was chosen\nfor zinc flotation. The criteria for the reagents selection were: high dispersion degree for galena and low\nfor the other species, high dispersion degree for sphalerite and low for the other species, low dispersion\ndegree for pyrite and high for the other species, and high dispersion degree for all species.\n\nLead flotation experiments were performed under three conditions aiming at verifying the influence of\nthe dispersing agent, of the pH, and of sodium carbonate. The zinc flotation tests were carried out at pH\n10.5, modulated with lime.\n\nThe use of dispersing agents in lead flotation did not improve the overall efficiency of the circuit for,\ndespite improving the lead metallurgical recovery, they increase significantly the zinc losses in the lead\nconcentrate.\n\nSodium carbonate presented a low dispersion degree and did not affect the lead flotation results when\ncompared with those achieved at natural pH and at pH 9.8 modulated with lime.\n\nTwo dispersing agents were particularly effective in zinc flotation: dispersant 3223, a sodium polyac-\nrylate, and sodium hexametaphosphate. Both reagents significantly enhanced zinc recovery without\nimpairing the concentrate quality.\n\n? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\n\nVotorantim Metais operates an underground mine in Paracatu,\nMG, Brazil, producing 1 ? 106 tonnes of ROM at 4.3% zinc grade\nand 2.0% lead grade. Lead flotation consists of rougher and cleaner\ncolumn flotation stages and scavenger stage performed in mechan-\nical cells. The lead circuit tailings feed the zinc circuit consisting of\nrougher and cleaner column flotation and scavenger and recleaner\nstages in mechanical cells. The middlings from the flotation circuit\n(cleaner tailings and scavenger concentrate) are reground aiming\nat further sphalerite liberation. The production of lead concentrate\nin 2007 was 26,000 tonnes at 62% lead grade and 82.5% lead recov-\nery. The production of zinc concentrate was 83,000 tonnes at 45.5%\nzinc grade and 89.0% zinc recovery.\n\nThe correlation between the dispersion degree of the particles\nin the pulp and flotation performance is well known in iron ores\nll rights reserved.\n\n: +55 31 34091815.\n.O. Silvestre), pereira@demi-\n. Galery), aecperes@deme-\ncationic reverse flotation, where quartz particles must be disperse\nand selective flocculation of iron oxides is desirable and actually\noccurs. The system under investigation is much more complex\nregarding either mineralogy or flotation stages requirements. In\nthe lead circuit, the dispersion of galena particles is essential. The\naggregation of the other minerals (sphalerite, pyrite, and dolo-\nmite), that are expected to report to the tailings, may even improve\nthe selectivity of the stage. The same approach applies to the zinc\ncircuit: sphalerite particles must be disperse and aggregation of\npyrite and dolomite might favour the rejection of these species\nto the tailings.\n\nMany decades of investigation were necessary in order that\nsome correlations between dispersion and flotation performance\nin iron ores reverse cationic flotation were established (Peres and\nSilva, 1994; Peres et al., 2003; Queiroz et al., 2005).\n\nThe flotation of silicate zinc minerals, willemite and hemi-\nmorphite, relies on adequate dispersion of the ore particles in the\npulp. Highly disperse pulps eliminate the need for desliming, but\nno direct correlation between dispersion and flotation is observed.\nThe most effective dispersants not always lead to the best flotation\nperformances Peres et al., 1994; Pereira and Peres, 2005).\n\nmailto:marcelo.silvestre@uszinc.com\nmailto:pereira@demin.ufop.br\nmailto:pereira@demin.ufop.br\nmailto:rgalery@demin.ufmg.br\nmailto:aecperes@demet.ufmg.br\nmailto:aecperes@demet.ufmg.br\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/08926875\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/mineng\n\n\nM.O. Silvestre et al. / Minerals Engineering 22 (2009) 752\u2013758 753\nThis study aims at addressing the dispersion degree of the par-\nticles in a lead\u2013zinc sulphide ore pulp as a tool for better under-\nstanding the flotation behaviour.\n\n2. Literature review\n\nDesliming preceding flotation is an industrial practice estab-\nlished over 60 years ago, introduced in the USBM process for the\niron ores cationic reverse flotation (Clemmer, 1947). A high disper-\nsion degree of the particles in the pulp is essential for effective des-\nliming, a requisite for the selectivity in most non-sulphide flotation\nsystems. Desliming stages are not generally performed in sulphide\nminerals flotation systems. One exception is the Mt. Keith concen-\ntrator (Western Australia), where desliming is done on a nickel sul-\nphide ore.\n\nThe theoretical aspects of ultrafine particles aggregation and\ndispersion are addressed by the DLVO theory, independently\ndeveloped by the Russians Derjaguin and Landau and the Dutch\nVervey and Overbeek, in the last century forties decade. After 50\nyears the classical DLVO theory was reviewed, incorporating struc-\ntural forces suggested by Churaev and Derjaguin (1985), resulting\nTable 1\nLead flotation experiments planning.\n\nStage Dispersant Dosage (g/\nt)\n\npH Sodium carbonate\n\nLead Sodium silicate\n(Na2SiO3)\n\n1000 9.8 Yes\n1250\n1500\n1750\n2000\n\nSodium silicate\n(Na2SiO3)\n\n1000 9.8 No, pH modified with\nlime1250\n\n1500\n1750\n2000\n\nSodium silicate\n(Na2SiO3))\n\n1000 Natural No\n1250\n1500\n1750\n2000\n\nLead 3223 100 9.8 Yes\n200\n300\n400\n500\n\n3223 100 9.8 No, pH modified with\nlime200\n\n300\n400\n500\n\n3223 100 Natural No\n200\n300\n400\n500\n\nLead Sodium\nhexametaphosphate\n\n250 9.8 Yes\n500\n750\n\n1000\n1500\n\nSodium\nhexametaphosphate\n\n250 9.8 No, pH modified with\nlime500\n\n750\n1000\n1500\n\nSodium\nhexametaphosphate\n\n250 Natural No\n500\n750\n\n1000\n1500\nin the extended DLVO theory or X-DLVO (Israelachvili, 1991; Lins\nand Adamian, 2000).\n\nThe concepts of the X-DLVO theory apply to the flotation pro-\ncess (Yoon, 1991). Flotation may be seen as the interaction be-\ntween two \u2018\u2018particles\u201d: ore and bubble.\n\nThere is an interrelation between dispersion and depressant ac-\ntion in systems involving mineral pulps.\n\nAmong dispersing/depressant inorganic agents, polyphosphates\nplay a special role, and among organic species low molecular\nweight acrylate polymers deserve special attention.\n\nRashchi and Finch (2000) investigated the chemistry and appli-\ncations of polyphosphates, stressing that the metal ions-poliphos-\nphate complexes formation may control the interfering ions action\nin the flotation process, preventing uncontrolled activation or\ndepression effects.\n\nPereira and Peres (1988) investigated the flotation selectivity of\na sulphide copper ore. The concentrate (chalcopyrite and bornite)\nwas contaminated by magnesium present in hypersthene (an iron\nand magnesium silicate). Liberation studies, zeta potential deter-\nminations and microflotation experiments suggested that the\nhypersthene flotation with thiocollectors was activated by the\npresence of ferrous ions present in the mineral lattice and also re-\nleased by grinding media and mill liners. After failure with the use\nof high molecular weight starch depressants, dispersion/depres-\nsion was successfully achieved with the use of a low molecular\nweight dextrin. The MgO content in the industrial concentrate\nwas brought down from 7.5% to 3.3%, well below the metallurgical\nspecification 4.5%.\n\nBulatovic (1999) reviewed the use of organic polymers in the\npolymetallic ores flotation. Aspects of the chemistry of starches,\ndextrins, modified lignosulfonates, and quebracho were discussed.\n\nGalena depression is achieved with dextrins (Bulatovic, 1999)\nand other organic polymers such as guar gum, corn starch, poly-\nsulphonated species (Pugh, 1989). Galena depression is a target\nin lead\u2013copper systems, but is totally undesirable regarding the\npresent investigation.\n\nLange et al. (1997) reported that the flotation of fine sphalerite\n(<20 lm), at pH 5, may be enhanced by aggregation with coarse\nparticles (up to 100 lm) in the conditioning with xanthate. Even\nbefore the reagents addition, aggregation was observed. At pH\n8.5 the surface hydroxides inhibit flotation.\n\nWightman et al. (2000) showed that the floatability of ultrafine\ngalena (<5 lm) may be improved by selective aggregation onto\ncoarse galena, precipitated in the laboratory, previously condi-\ntioned with a polymer.\n\nBoulton et al. (2001a,b) investigated the iron sulphides depres-\nsion in sphalerite flotation.

The reagent seems to activate sphalerite flotation\neven in copper sulphate absence.\n\nGalena flotation results in the presence of sodium hexameta-\nphosphate are presented in Fig. 2.\n\nComparing with the standard test (0 g/t), a drop in the lead con-\ntent in the concentrate was observed as a consequence of zinc loss.\nAgain, undesirable activation of sphalerite was observed.\n\nGalena flotation results in the presence of sodium silicate are\npresented in Fig. 3.\n\nThe reagent not only decreases lead grade and recovery in the\nconcentrate, but also increases sharply zinc losses.\n\nThe activation of sphalerite by dispersants may be explained by\nthe fact that disperse fine galena particles are prone to surface oxi-\ndation and, thus releasing Pb2+ ions in solution. Lead cations are\nwell-known sphalerite activators (Basilio et al., 1996).\n\nIt is worthwhile stressing that the lead feed grades in the three\nsets of experiments were different due to fluctuations in the ROM,\nresulting in different results for the standard test (absence of dis-\npersant).

Zinc flotation in the presenc\nperformed with lead feed grade 2.1%, a figure similar to that of\nthe sequence in the presence of sodium silicate (2.2% Pb). Both se-\nquences yielded similar results for the standard test. The standard\ntest in the presence of polyacrylate was carried out with a richer\nsample (3.6% Pb), producing higher concentrate lead grade and\nrecovery.\n\nA final comment on dispersants effect on lead flotation is that\nnone of them enhanced this stage performance. Nevertheless, the\ndispersion studies provided a relevant technological information.\nSodium carbonate does not have any dispersing effect towards\neither individual minerals or the ore. Bench scale experiments\nwere performed with the less expensive reagent hydrated lime\nsubstituting for soda ash as pH modulator in the lead circuit.

The reagent was effective in increasing\nzinc recovery and keeping the lead content in the concentrate low.\nA decrease in the zinc grade in the concentrate was observed.\n\nSphalerite flotation results in the presence of a sodium silicate\nand metasilicate blend are illustrated in Fig. 6. No significant effect\nwas observed regarding both zinc grade and grade.\n\nZinc feed grade in the sequence with the sodium silicate and\nmetasilicate blend was different from that of the tests in the pres-\nence of sodium polyacrylate and sodium hexametaphosphate.\n5. Conclusions\n\nThe dispersants use in the lead flotation stage did not improve the\noverall circuit efficiency. Despite enhancing the lead recovery, the re-\nagents caused unacceptable zinc losses in the lead concentrate.\nLead flotation either at natural pH or pH 9.8 modified with so-\ndium carbonate or lime presented similar results.\n\nA technological consequence of the low sodium carbonate dis-\npersing ability was the use of lime substituting for the more expen-\nsive sodium carbonate as pH modifier in the industrial circuit.\n\nThe use of both, the sodium polyacrylate 3223 and the inorganic\ndispersant sodium hexametaphosphate, increased significantly the\nzinc recovery, keeping low the lead content in the zinc concentrate\nand not interfering with the iron content in this product.\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nThe authors are grateful to Fapemig and CNPq for the financial\nsupport.\n\nReferences\n\nBandini, P., Prestidge, C.A., Ralston, J., 2001.
