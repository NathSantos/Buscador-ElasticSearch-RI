As a consequence, the need to more accurately access the \n\nvalue of an asset or an opportunity is essential, when the overall goal is to grow and to \n\nprosper. Furthermore, the recurrent instability in the financial markets has been unveiling \n\nirregular company?s stock variations, which are no longer reliable indicators of firm\u00b4s \n\nperformance evolution and ability to create future value.  \n\nIn this context, corporate valuation emerges as a leading-edge instrument for managers and \n\ninvestors that want to assess the real underlying value of their companies in order to make \n\nwiser business and investment decisions.  \n\nConsidering this, the main goal of the present dissertation is to value Galp Energia S.G.P.S, \n\nPortugal?s leading oil and gas company, which is currently quoted in the Lisbon Stock \n\nExchange Market and integrates the PSI-20 Index.  \n\nAfter a review of the fundamental academic literature existing, the company?s three main \n\nbusinesses segments as well as the debt tax shield were valued separately and the overall \n\nvaluation was accomplished, considering the sum of the different parts. Subsequently, a \n\nsensitivity analysis was made and the methodology and results were compared with the ones \n\nused by two Investment Banks \u2013 Millennium IB and Caixa IB \u2013 in their recent equity \n\nresearchs.  \n\nThe main conclusion is that each share of Galp Energia S.G.P.S. is currently being traded in \n\nthe stock market at a discount to its intrinsic value. The future developments of its E&amp;P \n\nprojects \u2013 mainly in Brazil \u2013 and the evolution of macro variables such as the oil price, the \n\ninternational benchmarks for refining margins and the EUR/USD exchange rate will define \n\nthe company?s future valuation updates.  \n\nhttp://www.ml.com/\nhttp://www.ml.com/\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         ii \n\n \n\nAbstrato \n\nAvalia\u00e7\u00e3o da empresa -  Galp Energia S.G.P.S. \n\nC\u00e1tia Maria Sousa Ferreira \n\n \n\nNos dias que correm, as empresas est\u00e3o envolvidas num ambiente intensamente \n\ncompetitivo e s\u00e3o mais complexas do que alguma vez o foram. Como consequ\u00eancia, a \n\nnecessidade de perceber o valor de um activo ou de uma oportunidade \u00e9 essencial, quando \n\no objectivo fundamental \u00e9 crescer e prosperar.  \n\nPara al\u00e9m disso, a recorrente instabilidade nos mercados financeiros tem denunciado \n\nvaria\u00e7\u00f5es irregulares no pre\u00e7o das ac\u00e7\u00f5es das empresas e por isso os sinais do mercado \n\naccionista deixaram de ser indicadores confi\u00e1veis da evolu\u00e7\u00e3o da performance da empresa \n\ne da sua habilidade de criar valor. \n\nNeste contexto, a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de empresas emerge como um importante instrumento para \n\ngestores e investidores que pretendam saber de forma mais precisa o valor real das \n\nempresas como forma de conseguir tomar melhores decis\u00f5es ao nivel das opera\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ncorrentes e de futuros investimentos. \n\nTendo isto em conta, o objectivo principal da presente disserta\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 o de avaliar a Galp \n\nEnergia S.G.P.S., a empresa portuguesa l\u00edder no sector do petr\u00f3leo e do g\u00e1s, que est\u00e1 \n\ncotada na Bolsa de Valores de Lisboa e que integra o Index PSI-20.   \n\nAp\u00f3s uma revis\u00e3o da literatura acad\u00e9mica essencial, os tr\u00eas segmentos da empresa, assim \n\ncomo o valor dos benef\u00edcios fiscais resultantes do envididamento, foram avaliados \n\nseparadamente e s\u00f3 depois a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da empresa foi feita, considerando a soma das \n\npartes. Subsequentemente uma an\u00e1lise de sensibilidade foi feita e a metodologia e os \n\nresultados foram comparados com aqueles utilizados por dois bancos de Investimento \u2013 \n\nMillennium BI e Caixa BI \u2013 nos seus recentes estudos da empresa. \n\nConclui-se que presentemente, cada ac\u00e7\u00e3o da Galp Energia S.G.P.S. encontra-se \n\nsubavaliada no mercado accionista.

Introduction \n\n1.1 Dissertation?s purpose \n\nIn this dissertation, Galp Energia S.G.P.S. (herein referred to as Galp Energia or Galp) is a \n\nvaluation object and the main goal is to launch a valuation model for it in order to reach an \n\naccurate value for each of its outstanding shares. The valuation reference date is December \n\n2011. \n\nAdditionally, it?s also an objective to compare my approach, assumptions and outcome with \n\nthe ones applied by two Investment Banks. \n\n \n\n1.2 Motivation   \n\nThe main incentive behind the choice of the company is the fact that Galp Energia S.G.P.S. \n\nis one of the few portuguese companies with most significant growth opportunities.  \n\nMoreover it?s the only oil and gas operator in Portugal and a strong player in the Iberian \n\nmarket\n1\n representing a great source of value for the overall Portuguese economy and its \n\ncompetitiveness - the company exports\n2\n are an important contribution to the Gross National \n\nProduct and to the equilibrium of Portugal?s Trade Balance. \n\nAs a further motive, Galp is a leading multi-energy business and a challenging valuation \n\nobject due to its personnel features and high correlation with the oil price.  \n\n \n\n1.3 Thesis Structure \n\nThe dissertation is organized in the following manner: \n\nIn section 2, a generalized literature review is presented, distinguishing the main valuation \n\napproaches and features. A special topic on the valuation of natural resources is offered. \n\nIn section 3, a succinct description of the company characteristics, corporate structure, \n\nbusiness segments, past performance and strategy in place is clarified. Furthermore, the \n\nindustry, its players and trends are briefly analyzed. \n\nIn section 4, the company?s macro environment is analized and a focus on the oil &amp; gas \n\noutlook can also be observed. \n\n                                                \n\n1\n According to the company sources, Galp?s market share for the refining products is 50% in Portugal and 8% in Spain.

Literature Review       \n\n2.1 Introduction \n\nFollowing the turbulent business, social, economic and political atmosphere in the last years, \n\ncorporate valuation has acquired momentum and became \u201cthe financial analytical skill that \n\ngeneral managers want to learn and master more than any other\u201d (Luehrman 1997a, p.132). \n\nKoller, Goedhart &amp; Wessels (2005) refer that it strengthens modern executives with the \n\nchance to make informed decisions about: the alternative business strategies, the corporate \n\nportfolio strategy and the effective capital structure to hold in order to sustain the company?s \n\nstrategy and to minimize the risk of financial distress. In this way, it allows them to envision \n\nthe direction the business is heading, to comprehend if the undertaken strategy is working, \n\nand even to access potential market inefficiencies. \n\n  \n\n2.2 The Valuation Process: general approaches \n\nIn current days there are more than a few developed theories and models that, in the view of \n\nfundamental analysts\n3\n, can be referenced and applied within a valuation process.  \n\nThere is an extensive amount of literature and Young et al. (1999, p.1) state that \u201cwe are fast \n\napproaching the point of valuation overload\u201d. \n\nNevertheless, Young et al. (1999, p.4) state that under specific assumptions, \u201cmost popular \n\nvaluation approaches are different ways of expressing the same underlying model\u201d and \n\nhence are \u201cmathematically equivalent\u201d. The basic principles are similar amongst the models \n\n(Damodaran 2002) and for Modigliani &amp; Miller (1961), different combinations of variables just \n\nprovide additional insights into the valuation process. Therefore, the choice of which model to \n\nuse is just a matter of taste and convenience and should depend on the nature of the \n\ncompany and on the valuation purpose.  \n\nFurthermore, in a valuation process each analyst interprets the reality and the information \n\navailable in a specific way and perceives the future with a particular shape, necessarily \n\nmaking assumptions about doubtful events. As a non objective science, Damodaran (2002, \n\np.7), allerts that \u201cit is unrealistic to expect [\u2026] absolute certainty in valuation, since cash \n\nflows and discount rates are estimated with error\u201d, particularly in young companies or the \n\nones inserted in tumultuous sectors.  \n\nTo reduce the number of mistakes that the uncertainty of forecasts and market conditions \n\nintroduces in the valuation process, the appraiser needs more than simply rely on the \n\n                                                \n3\n These analysts compute the called intrinsic (or fundamental) value as it?s also the purpose of the present dissertation. By this \n\ntechnique, the company's underlying value and potential for future growth is determined using the firm?s financials and related \ndata (activities, competition, growth prospects and macro variables) in order to reach to a stock value (Quirin, Berry &amp; O'Bryan \n2000). This contrasts with the technical analysis where securities are evaluated by analyzing the statistics generated by market \nactivity, such as past prices and volume, to identify patterns that can suggest future price movements (McAllen 2011). \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         4 \n\n \n\n  ??? =\n???(? + ?)\n\n(? ? ?)\n ? =\n\n???\n? + ?\n\n+\n???\n\n(? + ?)?\n+\n\n???\n(? + ?)?\n\n+ ? +\n??? + ???\n\n(? + ?)?\n      \n\nstraightforward application of the models equations. Young, Sullivan, Nokhasteh and Holt \n\n(1999) declare that the data reliability is more important than the valuation model chosen. \n\nDetermining corporate value is part art and part science (Siciliano &amp; Jones 1991) and as a \n\nconsequence, the company future projects, the competitive and macroeconomic environment \n\nand its value drivers should to be carefully scrutinized. \n\nAccording to Luehrman (1997a) the models should always be a function of three \n\nfundamental factors \u2013 cash, timing and risk. The most popular models in corporate valuation \n\ncan be analyzed under four broad and distinct approaches\n4\n (Damodaran 2005): discounted \n\ncash-flow valuation, liquidation and accounting valuation (asset based valuation), relative \n\nvaluation and contingent claim valuation.     \n\nIn this dissertation all four approaches are briefly explained. However the discussion will be \n\nmostly narrowed around the models that were considered as more suitable to value Galp \n\nEnergia  \u2013 the DCF and the Contingent Claim Valuation. \n\n2.2.1.1 Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation  \n\nAccording to Damodaran (2002), the discounted cash-flow valuation is seen as the \n\nfoundation on which all other valuation approaches are built and the model with the best \n\ntheoretical credentials (Damodaran 2005).  \n\nIn the 1970s, it emerged as the best practice for valuing corporate assets (Luehrman 1997a), \n\nand currently, Koller et al. (2005, p.4) observe that \u201cmore and more investors, analysts, and \n\ninvestment bankers are turning to [\u2026] sophisticated discounted cash flow (DCF) models as \n\nthe touchstone of corporate valuation\u201d. A view that is also supported by Damodaran (2005) \n\nand Fern\u00e1ndez (2007c). \n\nIts foundation lies on the notion of \u201cpresent value\u201d (PV) which states that the value of any \n\nasset is simply the present value of its expected future cash flows, discounted back at the \n\nrate that reflects the riskiness of those cash flows (Damodaran 2002). \n\nIt accesses the company as a financial asset (Fern\u00e1ndez 2007c) and Damodaran (2005) \n\nhighlights the following general equation, that serves as basis for the DCF models: \n\n \n\nwhere: \n\nV = Value of the company \n\nCF i = Cash flows generated by the company in period i  \n\n                                                \n4\n A compact overview of the valuation approaches can be seen in Appendix 1.  \n\n  (1) \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         5 \n\n \n\nk = Discount rate for the cash flow?s risk  \n\nTv n =Terminal value of the company in the year n \n\ng = Expected growth rate of cash flows after the explicit period \n\n \n\nThe company value is computed by adding two separated components: the specific forecasts \n\nover a limited number of years and the terminal value. \n\nDespite the DCF general formula, Damodaran (2002) observes that there are literally \n\nthousands of discounted cash flow models variants in existence. According to Oded &amp; Michel \n\n(2007) and Fernandez (2007b), the basic differences among them lie in the cash flows taken \n\nas the starting point for the valuation and in the discount rates that are under each. \n\nNevertheless,  if there is no mismatch between the cash flows and discount rates used, \n\nconsistent estimates of value should be yield (Damodaran 2002). \n\n \n\nThe Terminal Value  \n\nThe terminal value, often called continuing value, i.e., the value after the growth period, \n\nmeasures the long-run value and can be difficult to estimate with any degree of accuracy. \n\nNonetheless it deserves a special attention since it represents the lion?s share of market \n\nvalue (Young et al. 1999).  \n\nAccording to Damodaran (2002), there are three alternate routes to compute the terminal \n\nvalue: i) assume that the cash flows of the firm will grow at a constant rate forever and \n\ntherefore use a perpetual growth model (as demonstrated in equation (1)), ii) assume the \n\nliquidation of the firm?s assets after some years and estimate what others would pay for the \n\ntotal assets at that point of time, or iii) rely on relative valuation, applying a multiple to \n\nearnings, revenues or book value.  \n\nFern\u00e1ndez (2007c) also points out that although the flows are assumed to be perpetual, it?s \n\npossible to ignore some of them after a certain period, attending to the asset under valuation. \n\nThis happens because on one hand, the present value decreases progressively with longer \n\ntime horizons and on the other hand, the competitive advantage of many businesses tends to \n\ndisappear after a few years. In this perspective, as the explicit period considered augments, \n\nthere is less measurement error and the explanatory power of the results increase (Torrez, \n\nAl-Jafari &amp; Juma?h 2006). \n\n \n\n2.2.1.1.1 DCF valuation: Equity Value versus Firm Value \n\nThe diverse DCF variants can also be differentiated by the way they bring forward the value. \n\nFolowing this reasoning, they can disclose the equity value - when only the equity stake of \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         6 \n\n \n\n????? ??? ????? ?? ????? =  \n?(????)\n\n ? + ?? \n?\n\n?=?\n\n?=?\n\n \n\nthe business is valued - or the firm or enterprise value - when the entire business, with both \n\nassets-in-place and growth assets are under valuation.  \n\nNonetheless, it?s always possible to get from the firm value to the equity value. Whether it is \n\napproached directly (by discounting cash flows to equity at the cost of equity) or indirectly (by \n\nvaluing the firm and then netting out the market value of all non-equity claims), the equity \n\nvalue should be the same (Damodaran 2005). \n\n \n\n 2.2.1.1.1.1 Equity Valuation Models  \n\nIn the equity valuation models, the result obtained is the firm value to the equity holders\n5\n \n\n(Young et al. 1999).  \n\nThe value is generally obtained by discounting expected cash flows to equity at the rate of \n\nreturn required by the equity investors of the firm (Damodaran 2002).  \n\nThese cash flows are the ones that remain available in the company after covering fixed \n\nasset investments, working capital requirements and financial charges and after repaying the \n\ncorresponding part of the debt?s principal, as explained by Fern\u00e1ndez (2007c).  \n\nIn this context, Damodaran (2005) brings to the spotlight two variants of the DCF valuation \n\nwhere the cash flows to equity holders are viewed differently - the Dividend Discount Model \n\n(DDM) and the Free Cash Flow to Equity Model (FCFE). \n\n2.2.1.1.1.1.1 The Dividend Discount Model (DDM) \n\nIn the words of Damodaran (2005), the dividend discount model represent the oldest\n6\n \n\ntheoretical variant in practice of the neo-classical DCF models. The dividends are assumed \n\nas the only regular flow received by the equity holders (M\u00fcller &amp; Tel\u00f3 2003). As a \n\nconsequence, the current worth of a share is seen as the \u201cdiscounted value of the stream of \n\ndividends to be paid on the share in perpetuity\u201d (Modigliani &amp; Miller 1961, p. 419), i.e., the \n\nliquid present value of the expected dividends (Damodaran 2005 and M\u00fcller &amp; Tel\u00f3 2003). \n\nAccording to Damodaran (2005), it?s possible to infer that, within DDM: \n\n \n\nwhere: \n\nE(DPS t) = Expected dividends per share in period t \n\nke = Cost of equity \n\n                                                \n5\n According to Damodaran (2005), equity and debt holders are different primary due to the nature of their cash flow claims \u2013 \n\nlenders get priority to claim the cash flows and equity investors get only the residual amount available. \n6\n The book  \u201cThe Theory of Investment Value\u201d  written by Jonh Burr Williams in 1983, was the first to explicitly connect the \n\npresent value concept with dividends (Damodaran 2005). \n\n  (2) \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         7 \n\n \n\nwhere: \n\nDPS1 = Expected dividends in period 1 \n\nke = Cost of equity \n\ng = Expected growth rate in perpetuity \n\n \n\n  ????? ?? ??? ????? =\n????\n\n(?? ? ?)\n \n\nThe cost of equity (ke) is determined by its riskiness and can be measured by different \n\nmodels such as the market beta in the CAPM\n7\n (Damodaran 2005). \n\nTo compute the expected dividends (E(DPS t)), assumptions about future growth rates in \n\nearnings and payout ratios have to be made (Damodaran 2005).  \n\nNonetheless, M\u00fcller &amp; Tel\u00f3 (2003) note that the payout ratio and the growth rate in earnings \n\nare correlated. They clarify that if the company has a high payout ratio, it will have a lower \n\ngrowth in the stock value since it?s distributing part of the profit that in other way, would be \n\nretained and reinvested in the business.  \n\nIn this context, the different assumptions about the expected future growth of companies, \n\nshed light to the development of tailored versions of the DDM such as the Gordon growth \n\nmodel or the multi-stage DDM. \n\n \n\nThe Gordon Growth Model   \n\nFor firms that are in a 'steady state' with dividends growing at a constant rate that can be \n\nsustained forever, the Gordon growth model\n8\n is applied (Damodaran 2002). Within this \n\nvariant, the value of a stock can be computed as follows: \n\n \n\n     \n\n \n\nIn this version of the DDM model, there are two main constraints in what concerns to the \n\ngrowth rate of dividends: it cannot be greater than the overall growth rate of the economy \n\n(since any firm cannot grow forever at a rate higher than the growth rate of the economy in \n\nwhich it operates) and it should be similar to the expected growth in the other measures of \n\nperformance, such as earnings (Damodaran 2005).  \n\n  \n\nThe Multi-Stage DDM \n\nFor firms that are non stable-growth companies, some extensions of the model were also \n\ndeveloped over time mainly in response to the need of more flexibility when valuing firms that \n\nare expected to grow differently in distinct stages of time and consequently have divergent \n\npayout ratios across the time.  \n\nWhen compared to the Gordon growth model, these models fit better into the reality \n\n(Damodaran 2005), since in practice, given the volatility of earnings in most companies, the \n\nassumption of a constant growth rate in dividends is inadequate (Damodaran 2002).  \n\n                                                \n7\n The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) was postulated in the 1960?s by Jonh Lintner and William Sharpe and even resulted \n\nin a Nobel Prize for Sharpe in 1990. This model is better explained in the page 13. \n8\n According to Damodaran (2005), the model was developed by David Durand and Myron Gordon, but it was the last one who \n\npopularized it, thus giving his name to the model. \n\n  (3) \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         8 \n\n \n\n?????? ????? =\n?????\n? + ??\n\n+\n?????\n\n ? + ?? ?\n+\n\n?????\n ? + ?? ?\n\n+ ? +\n????? + ???\n\n ? + ? ?\n  ??? =\n\n?????(? + ?)\n\n ?? ? ? \n \n\nSome examples are: i) the two\u2013stage DDM that assumes two distinct phases with two \n\ndifferent growing rhythms and, ii) the H model, presented by Fuller &amp; Chi-Cheng (1984) that \n\nassumes that the growth rate in the initial phase is not constant and drops in linear \n\nincrements each year, converging later to a stable growth rate (Damodaran 2005). \n\n \n\nDespite the large range of critics along the years, the DDM approach still has its proponents \n\nsince: i) fewer assumptions are needed to get to the forecasted dividends when compared \n\nwith the forecasted FCF, what eases the process and, ii) managers can set their dividends at \n\nsustainable levels even with volatile earnings (Damodaran 2005). \n\nOn the list of cons, and as the same author explains: it undervalues companies with \n\nmeaningful cash balances and it overvalues firms that pay more dividends that their available \n\ncash flows, since it doesn?t consider the potential future problems on external funding to \n\nmeet the deficits in perpetuity. In addition, Damodaran (2002) adverts that it does not \n\naccounts for other ways of returning cash to stockholders (such as stock buybacks) and it \n\nneglects the value of 'unutilized assets' or other valuable assets such as the value of brand \n\nnames. \n\nDamodaran (2005) even asserts that the fact that increasingly less practitioners use the \n\ndividend discount model in valuation is testimony to the belief that there are better ways of \n\ndoing DCF valuation. \n\n 2.2.1.1.1.1.1 The Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) Model \n\nThe free cash flow to equity valuation (FCFE) it?s a simple departure on the DDM, with just \n\none significant change: the FCFE replaces the value of dividends in the models, as observed \n\nby Damodaran (2002). Instead of discounting the actual dividends paid by the firm, as in the \n\nDDM, it discounts the cash that could have been paid out in dividends - potential dividends \n\n(Damodaran 2005). \n\nThe value to shareholders are estimated in the following manner (Fernandez 2005): \n\n \n\n \n\nwhere: \n\nFCFE i = Free Cash flow to equity generated by the company in period i  \n\nk = Discount rate for the cash flow?s risk, i.e., the cost of equity \n\nTV n = Terminal value  \n\ng = Expected growth rate of cash flows after the explicit period \n\n \n\n  (4) \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         9 \n\n \n\nThe FCFE are measured by the cash flows left over after meeting all financial obligations \n\n(such as debt payments) and after covering all reinvestment needs such as capital \n\nexpenditures and working capital, i.e.: \n\nFCFE = Net Income + Depreciation - Capital Expenditures - Change in Non-cash Working \n\nCapital - (New Debt Issued - Debt Repayments). \n\nWhen comparing DDM and FCFE valuation, Damodaran (2005) affirms that the former \n\nshould be adopted just if we are facing a company reluctant to changes in corporate control, \n\nsince in this case, the dividend policy of the firm is unlikely to be adjusted. If a firm can be \n\neasily taken or there is some probability for the management to change, FCFE models \n\nshould be the valuation tool in use, since they are able to capture a higher value. \n\nAs happens in the DDM, there are similar variations of the FCFE models developed around \n\ndifferent assumptions for future growth and reinvestment needs (Damodaran 2005).  \n\n \n\n2.2.1.1.1.2 Firm Valuation Models \n\nThe firm valuation models aim to value the firm as a whole, i.e., not only the equity stake but \n\nalso the funds provided by third parties, such as the financial debt (Damodaran 2002). As a \n\nconsequence, in comparison to the equity value, the major difference lies in the fact that it \n\nincorporates the tax benefits of debt and the expected additional risk associated with this \n\nsource of financing - in the form of higher costs of equity and debt and superior debt ratios \n\n(Damodaran 2005). \n\nThe same author suggests the following models to compute the firm value: a) the Free Cash \n\nFlow to the Firm or the Cost of Capital approach; b) the Adjusted Present Value; c) the \n\nCapital Cash Flow approach; or the d) Economic Value Added. \n\n2.2.1.1.1.2.1 The Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) Model \n\nIn the words of Damodaran (2005), the origins of this model lie on one of corporate finance?s \n\nmost cited papers by Modigliani &amp; Miller (1958). It states that the firm value is obtained \n\ndiscounting the cumulated cash flows to all claim holders - also called the free cash flow to \n\nthe firm (FCFF) - by the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). \n\nIn this line of thought, the cash flows considered are the ones available after taxes and \n\nreinvestment needs,  but prior to any equity and non-equity claims. \n\n \n\n \n\n  (5) \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         10 \n\n \n\n?? =\n?????\n\n? + ????\n+\n\n?????\n ? + ???? ?\n\n+\n?????\n\n ? + ???? ?\n+ ? +\n\n????? + ???\n ? + ???? ?\n\n          ??? =\n?????(? + ?)\n\n ???? ? ? \n \n\nThe general version of the FCFF or the cost of capital approach can be presented as follows \n\n(Damodaran 2005):  \n\n \n\n \n\nwhere: \n\nEV =  Entreprise value \n\nFCFF i = Free cash flow to the firm generated by the company in period i \n\nWACC = Weighted average cost of capital  \n\nTv n = Terminal value of the company in the year n \n\ng = Expected growth rate of cash flows after the explicit period \n\n \n\nTo compute the FCFF and despite the diverse definitions, the subsequent formula illustrates \n\na simple way to compute it (Damodaran 2005):  \n\nFCFF = EBIT(1- tax rate) + Depreciation &amp; Amortization \u2013 Capital expenditures \u2013 ? Working \n\nCapital \n\nTo come across with the FCFF, we begin with the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), \n\ndeduct the corporate taxes (to achieve the after-tax operating income), add the depreciation \n\n&amp; amortization since it?s not real cash and subtract the capital expenditures and working \n\ncapital needs.  \n\nThe free cash flows are computed as if the firm had no debt and consequently no tax \n\nbenefits due to interest payments (Damodaran 2005). According to Damodaran (2002), this \n\nhappens on purpose once the concurrent use of the after-tax cost of debt in the cost of \n\ncapital already considers the tax deduction for interest payments.  \n\nThis fact reflects one of the prevailing strengths of the model - any changes in the company?s \n\nfinancing mix is built into the valuation adjusting the discount rate rather than the cash flows \n\n(Damodaran 2005). As a result, the model is most suitable for firms that have very high \n\nleverage or are in the process of changing their leverage (Damodaran 2002). \n\nNonetheless and similarly to what happens to the other DCF models previously described in \n\nthis dissertation, there are several variations of the FCFF models \u2013 for example: a stable \n\ngrowth, a two-stage and a three-stage models - largely as a consequence of the future \n\ngrowth assumptions and on how long they are expected to be maintained (Damodaran \n\n2005). \n\nThe same author also emphasizes that this model only values the operating assets of the \n\nfirm and as a consequence, if the company has any assets whose earnings were not \n\n  (6) \n\n  (7) \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         11 \n\n \n\naccounted in the operating income \u2013 such as cash and marketable securities, the operating \n\nincome from minority holdings and idle and unutilized assets - they have not been valued yet. \n\nFurthermore, to arrive at the equity value, all non-equity claims that have to be subtracted out \n\nto include not only all debt, but in addition all capitalized leases as well as unfunded pension \n\nplans and health care obligations. \n\n2.2.1.1.1.2.1.1 The WACC \n\nWhen valuing a company as a whole, the weighted average cost of capital \u2013 WACC \u2013 is by \n\nfar, the average figure used as the cost of capital (Maruca 1996). It must reflect the cost \n\nassociated with raising the capital - equity or debt or both \u2013 in the proportion to which they \n\nfinance the company?s asset base (Fern\u00e1ndez 2007c). \n\n It?s the risk adjusted discount rate (Damodaran 2005) to use as input to the model or - as \n\nModigliani &amp; Miller (1963) refer - the minimum return that the company must offer to the \n\ninvestors to be just worth undertaking the project. \n\nThe general formula is the following (Booth 2007): \n\n  \n\nwhere: \n\nRe t = Cost of equity in period t \n\nRd t = Cost of debt in period t \n\nE t-1  = Market  value  of  the  firm?s  equity \n\nD t-1 =  Market value of the firm?s debt \n\nE t-1/(E t-1+D t-1) = percentage that is financed by equity \n\nD t-1/(E t-1+D t-1) = percentage that is financed by debt  \n\nV = E + D = Firm value \n\n \n\nNotwithstanding, there is room for disagreement among several authors about the practice of \n\nusing WACC. Luehrman (1997b) establishes that the WACC is not good at handling financial \n\nside effects automatically since it just addresses the tax effects on raising debt. Damodaran \n\n(2005) by its turn, assures that the effects of leverage are reflected in WACC by two \n\nmanners: i) the tax benefits are incorporated in the after-tax cost of debt and ii) the \n\nbankruptcy costs are mirrored in both the levered beta and in the pre-tax cost of debt. \n\nAnother point of view is that the WACC sponsors simplification in the companies? values \n\n  (8) \n\n????? =  \n????\n\n???? + ????\n? ??? +  \n\n????\n???? + ????\n\n? ???

Furthermore, the assumption of a constant and \n\nperpetual growth rate in dividends inferior to the cost of equity makes the model inadequate \n\nfor companies with unstable dividend patterns or which are rapidly growing.  \n\nFor this reason, despite of also having limitations, the CAPM can yield more realistic \n\nestimates (Torrez et. al 2006) of the company?s cost of equity and it?s the preferred method \n\namong corporate analysts (Maruca 1996).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n9\n The valuation model called Adjusted Present Value is explained in page 15. \n\n  (9) \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         13 \n\n \n\n2.2.1.1.1.2.1.2.2 The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) \n\nThe CAPM, developed by Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965), marked the birth of asset \n\npricing theory and is nowadays one of the most widely used models in finance (Mukherji \n\n2011). \n\nThe same author clarifies that within this model, a firm?s return on equity (Ke) is a linear \n\nfunction of its market risk: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe expected return on equity is the sum of the risk-free rate (Rf)\n10\n\n plus a risk premium\n11\n\n. \n\nThe risk premium equals the Beta multiplied by the market risk premium which is the \n\nexpected return on the market minus the risk-free rate. \n\nFurthermore, the model only works correctly if we assume that investors are well diversified \n\nand consequently only exposed to the systematic risk\n12\n\n of the investment, which is measured \n\nby the company?s beta. \n\n \n\nThe Risk-Free Rate \n\nAccording to Koller et al. (2005), the risk-free rate is defined as the return on a portfolio that \n\nhas no covariance with the market and it should be chosen to match the term of cash flows \n\n(Maruca 1996). \n\nDue to the high liquidity, in the context of valuation, the yield to maturity on long term \n\ntreasury bonds is used as a reference (Maruca 1996). The German and French government \n\nbonds\n13\n\n are the guide to get the risk-free rate in Euros (Damoradan 2008) due to their higher \n\nliquidity and lower credit risk when compared to bonds of other European countries (Koller et \n\nal. 2005). Also, the usage of year-specific risk-free rates is usually needless since these \n\nrates do not deviate radically over years (Damoradan 2008). \n\n \n\nThe Beta coefficient \n\nIt?s described as the security?s volatility relative to the market?s volatility (Mullins 1982). \n\nMaruca (1996) refers that it?s usually drawn from published sources, once the internal \n\n                                                \n10\n\n The variable that sustains the CAPM reasoning (Mullins 1982) measuring the return on a riskless investment. \n11\n\n The extra expected return that investors demand as compensation for taking on that extra risk, i.e., for investing in this \nportfolio relative to the risk-free asset (Damodaran 2002). Higher-risk securities are priced to yield higher expected returns than \nlower-risk securities (Mullins 1982). \n12\n\n The risk related to the movement of the stock market and therefore unavoidable (Mullins 1982). \n13\n\n The lowest of the German and French 10-year government bond rates should be used (Damoradan 2008). \n\n  (10) \n\nwhere: \n\nRf = rate of return for risk-free investments \n\n\u00df= equity beta, denoting market risk \n\nRm = expected market return \n\n(Rm \u2013 Rf ) = market risk premium or equity premium \n\nKe = Cost of equity \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n?? = ??  +  ?

However, since it reflects the \n\nindustry risk, the beta may need some refinements to adjust for the companies? differences \n\nrelated to financial leverage and others factors (Mullins 1982). \n\n \n\nThe Market Risk Premium or Equity Premium \n\nThe calculation of the market risk premium remains an unresolved issued for many analysts. \n\nA few models were developed to foresee it but none has gained universal acceptance since \n\nall bear some weaknesses.  \n\nKoller et al. (2005) suggest that it?s possible to estimate the future market returns using: i) the \n\nextrapolation of historical excess returns, introduced by Ibbotson &amp; Sinquefield (1976) ii)  \n\nadvanced regression techniques against observable financial ratios, such as the dividend-to-\n\nprice ratio (also defended by Lewellen (2004)) or iii) using the Gordon and Shapiro?s \n\nsuggestion of a DDM, projecting future corporate dividends and then calculating the internal \n\nrate of return that sets the current market capitalization equal to the present value of future \n\nexpected dividends.  \n\nNonetheless, it can also be reasonably obtained by surveying financial professionals or \n\nacademics that make available their expectations for the different market?s risk premiums \n\n(Soenen &amp; Johnson 2008).  \n\nAccording to Damodaran (2002), the equity risk premium is the sum of a base premium for \n\nmature equity markets and the country risk premium. Nonetheless, the specific country risk \n\npremium should only be considered if the risk of investing on it, is non-diversifiable and has a \n\nlow correlation to other markets. Maruca (1996) and Koller et al. (2005) affirm that based on \n\nhistorical averages and forward looking estimates, the appropriate base market risk premium \n\nlies between 4,5 and 5,5%. \n\n2.2.1.1.1.2.1.3 The Cost of Debt (Rd) \n\nAccording to Cooper &amp; Davydenko (2007), the true cost of debt has to account for any \n\nexpected default loss and therefore it must lie somewhere between the promised yield and \n\nthe risk-free rate. However, this subject causes a lot of head scratching and despite of the \n\nseveral theories, most methods are hard to implement or lead to significant errors because \n\nthey fail to capture firm-specific and current market information. \n\nNonetheless, Damodaran (1996) states that the cost of the debt measures the cost to the \n\nfirm of borrowing funds to finance its projects and it depends mainly on three factors: the \n\nriskless rate, the default risk and the tax advantage associated with debt. \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         15 \n\n \n\n?? =\n?????\n? + ??\n\n+\n?????\n\n(? + ??)\n?\n\n+\n?????\n\n(? + ??)\n?\n\n+ ? +\n????? + ???\n\n(? + ??)\n?\n\n               ??? =\n?????(? + ?)\n\n ?? ? ? \n \n\nAs a consequence, to encounter the cost of debt before taxes, a default spread (depending \n\nupon the company?s credit risk) should be added to the risk-free rate (Damoradan 2008). \n\nAdditionally, Koller et al. (2005) assert that is also possible to estimate the cost of debt only \n\nusing the yield-to-maturity of the company?s outstanding long term bonds. \n\nDespite the calculation alternatives, the fact is that, for most companies, the cost of debt \n\n(before tax) is usually lower than the cost of equity. \n\n2.2.1.1.1.2.2 The Adjusted Present Value (APV) Model \n\nAccording to Damodaran (2002), the adjusted present value (APV) method unbundles the \n\nfirm?s value, computing first the value from its operations and then adding the effects of the \n\nvalue of debt and other non-equity claims.  \n\nConsequently it adds managerially relevant information to the company (Luehrman 1997b) \n\nexposing individually all the components of value and being easily adaptable to changing \n\ncapital structures\n14\n\n. \n\nThe firm value results from the sum of three major procedures, through APV. In the first step \n\nwe value the firm as if it had no leverage. Within the second step, it is considered the value \n\nadded (or taken away) by a given level of debt, computing the present value of the interest \n\ntax savings. And in the third step, the probability of the firm to go bankrupt and the expected \n\ncosts of financial distress are appraised.  \n\nBecause of this, it?s possible to state that:  \n\n \n\nFirm Value = Present value of business with 100% equity financing (Vu = Value of the firm \n\nunlevered) + Present value of expected interest tax shields (PVTS) \u2013 Present Value of \n\nexpected bankruptcy costs (PVEBC) \n\nThe following formula summarizes step one: \n\nwhere: \n\nVu = Value of the firm unlevered \n\nFCFF = after-tax operating cash flow to the firm \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n14\n\n  In accordance with Damodaran (2005) and Cooper &amp; Nyborg (2007), the financing side is not captured in the discount rate as \nmost DCF approaches. \n\n  (11) \n\n  (12) \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         16 \n\n \n\n?? ??  =   \n??? ????? ?   ???????? ?????  ?  ?????\n\n(? + ?)?\n\n?=?\n\n?=?\n\n \n\n????? = ??????????? ?? ?????????? ? ?? ?? ?????????? ????? \n\n=  ?? ? ???? \n\nKu = unlevered cost of equity or required return on assets\n15\n\n \n\ng = expected growth rate \n\nTVn = Terminal value \n\n \n\nThe step two is accomplished through the following equation: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nwhere: \n\nPV TS = Present value of the expected tax savings due to payment of interest \n\nr = rate that reflects the riskiness of these cash flows  \n\n \nand the last step, although uneasy to estimate and recurrently neglected in practice, \n\naccording to Damodaran (2005) and Luehrman (1997b) is calculated in the following manner: \n\n \n\nwhere: \n\nPV EBC = Present value of the expected bankruptcy costs \n\n2.2.1.1.1.2.2.1 TheTax Shield Dilemma  \n\nA worth mentioning subject of debate among a number of academics lies on the correct \n\ndiscount rate to use when computing the present value of the interests tax shield (PV TS) \n\n(Fernandez 2007a). \n\nAlthough Modigliani &amp; Miller (1963) propose to discount the tax savings at a risk free rate \n\n(Rf), Fernandez (2004) demonstrates that this view provides inconsistent results for growing \n\ncompanies. \n\nOne alternative is to refer Myers (1974), Taggart (1991), Luehrman (1997a), Cooper &amp; \n\nNyborg (2006) and others which consent that the value of the interest tax savings should be \n\ndiscounted back at the cost of debt (Kd), based on the premise that tax shields are as \n\nuncertain as principal and interest payments. Nonetheless, this cost of debt does not \n\ninevitably has to be the interest rate at which the company has contracted its debt and it may \n\n                                                \n15\n\n According  to Fern\u00e1ndez (2007), in a leveraged company, the required return on assets is smaller than the required return to \n\nequity because financial risk anchored by the existence of debt implies a higher equity risk premium to shareholders.  \n\n  (13) \n\n \n \n\n(14) \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         17 \n\n \n\nbe the debt?s market cost, as observed by Fern\u00e1ndez (2007c). Furthemore it will only work \n\nfor expected debt fixed levels (Fernandez 2007a).  \n\nHarris &amp; Pringle (1985), Ruback (2002), Kaplan &amp; Ruback (1995), Brealey &amp; Myers (2000) \n\nand Tham &amp; V\u00e9lez-Pareja (2001), by their turn, propose that the tax to discount the interests \n\ntax shield should be the required return to unlevered equity (Ku) since the leverage and the \n\ntax shields accomplish with it are positively correlated to the firm?s operating cash flows and \n\ntherefore deserve the same discount rate. Ruback (2002) also supports this point of view \n\nstating that it is more reasonable to assume that interest tax savings share the same risk as \n\nthe operating assets, with fluctuating capital structures, rather than rely on the conventional \n\nAPV?s assumption that the interest tax savings are discounted back at the cost of debt \n\nsupposing a constant the debt ratio. \n\nRegardless of these previous divergent points of views, there is another alternative to \n\ndiscount the value of the tax shields, depending on the debt strategy of the firm. Therefore: i) \n\nif a firm intends to keep a constant D/E ratio, an analyst should discount the interest tax \n\nshields with Kd for the first year and Ku in later years as recommended by Miles &amp; Ezzell \n\n(1980), Lewellen and Emery (1986) and Fernandez (2005);  ii) if the amount of debt is the \n\nfixed factor, the interest tax shields should be discounted with Rd, in the words of Inselbag &amp; \n\nKaufold (1997) and Ruback (2002). \n\nTaggart (1991) by its turn explores another path and suggests using Miles &amp; Ezzell (1980) \n\npoint of view if the target debt ratio of the company is adjusted once a year and Harris &amp; \n\nPringle (1985) theory if the company adjusts to that ratio continuously.  \n\nReflecting this lack of consensus, the finance literature does not clarifies which discount rate \n\nis theoretically correct (Fernandez 2007a).  \n\n2.2.1.1.1.2.3 The Capital Cash Flow (CCF) Model \n\nThe capital cash flow (CCF) valuation or the compressed APV approach was presented by \n\nKaplan &amp; Ruback (1995) and within this view, the firm value is computed using the capital \n\ncash flows discounted back at the expected asset return (Ruback 2002).  \n\nThe cash flows considered are the after-tax cash flows available to all capital providers - both \n\ndebt and equity investors (Kaplan &amp; Ruback 1995). Therefore they include the debt tax \n\nshields, assuming a similar systematic risk between the interest tax shield and the operating \n\nfree cash flow (Cooper &amp; Nyborg 2007). Furthermore, and because the interest tax shields \n\nare included in the CCF, the appropriate discount rate is before taxes and corresponds to the  \n\nWACC. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         18 \n\n \n\n?? =\n????\n\n? + ??????\n+\n\n????\n ? + ?????? \n\n?\n+\n\n????\n ? + ?????? \n\n?\n+ ? +\n\n???? + ???\n ? + ?????? \n\n?\n ??? =\n\n????(? + ?)\n\n ?????? ? ? \n \n\n?????? =  \n????\n\n???? + ????\n? ??? +  \n\n????\n???? + ????\n\n? ??? \n\n??? =  ???? +  ???????? ??? ??????? \n\nThe general principle is the following: \n\n \n\n \n\nwhere, \n\n \n\n \n\nand,         \n\n \n\nIn the words of Ruback (2002), this model is more useful than others, when we are dealing \n\nwith highly leveraged transactions, restructurings, project transactions and other instances \n\nwhere the capital structure changes over time. \n\nWhen compared with the APV conventional model, the major difference is that the CCF \n\nmethod discounts the tax shields at WACCBT rather than at the cost of debt (Rd) (typically a \n\nlower rate) as in the APV. As a result the value through APV will be higher because they \n\nimplicitly assume the debt level to be a fixed amount and consequently the tax shields are \n\ntreated as less risky when compared to the firm assets. \n\n2.2.1.1.1.2.4 Excess Returns Models - the case of Economic Value Added (EVA)  \n\nThe excess return models are seen as another variant of the DCF approach and consider \n\nthat any investment only adds value to a business if it?s able to generate excess returns, i.e., \n\nthe returns on equity (or capital) have to exceed the cost of equity (or capital) as explained \n\nby Damodaran (2005).  \n\nOne of its variants that has acquired momentum, is the Economic Value Added (EVA) that  \n\nmeasures the surplus value created by an investment or a portfolio of investments \n\n(Damodaran 2005). \n\nThe mathematical reasoning behind it, is that: \n\nEVA = (Return on capital invested \u2013 Cost of capital) x (Capital invested) \n\n        = After-tax operating income \u2013 (Cost of capital) x (Capital invested) \n\n  (15) \n\n  (16) \n\n  \n \n \n\n(17) \n\n  (18) \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         19 \n\n \n\n???? ????? = ??????? ?????????????? ?? ????? +  ????????? ?? ????? +  ????????? ????????,?\n\n?=?\n\n?=?\n\n \n\nwhere: \n\nEVA t = Economic value added by the project \n\nK c = Cost of capital \n\nn = Life length of the project \n\n \n\n??? =  \n????\n\n ? + ?? \n?\n\n?=?\n\n?=?\n\n \n\n???? ????? = ??????? ?????????????? ?? ????? +   \n????,?????? ?? ?????\n\n(? + ??)\n?\n\n?=?\n\n?=?\n\n+   \n????,?????? ????????\n\n(? + ??)\n?\n\n?=?\n\n?=?\n\n \n\n???? ????? = ????? ?? ??? ?????? ?? ????? + ????? ?? ???????? ?????? ?????? \n\nIn this way, the NPV of a project measured using the EVA is \u201cthe present value of the \n\neconomic value added by that project over its life\u201d (Damodaran 2005, p.732) and it?s \n\ncalculated in the following way: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWhe the purpose is corporate valuation, Damodaran (2002) states that, the firm value can be \n\nseen as the sum of the capital invested currently in the firm and the present value of the \n\nexcess returns that the firm expects to make in the future, i.e.: \n\n \n\nOr more explicitly: \n\n \n\nFurthermore, due to the connection between EVA and NPV it?s possible to value a firm just \n\nsubstituting the NPV by the EVA in the previous formula (Damodaran 2005), as evidenced \n\nnext: \n\n \n\nAs a consequence, the firm value can be written as the sum of three components - the \n\ncapital invested in assets in place, the economic value added by these assets and the \n\nexpected economic value that will be added by future investments (Damodaran 2005). \n\nThe same author also explains that the other variants of EVA \u2013 such as Economic Profit or \n\nCash flow return on investment (CFROI) models \u2013 differ essentially on how excess returns \n\nare computed. \n\nStill, most analysts face serious obstacles to get reasonable estimates for the variables that \n\nserve as inputs to the model, and for that reason the approach is not widely used.  \n\n  (19) \n\n  (20) \n\n  (21) \n\n  (22) \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         20 \n\n \n\n2.2.1.2 Liquidation and Accounting Valuation  \n\nAlso known as the balance sheet-based techniques or assets based valuation, this approach \n\nneglects the fact that a firm is an on-going-entity and focuses primarily on valuing the firm?s \n\nassets in place.  \n\nIn this way, is usually not recommended for companies with meaningful growth opportunities \n\n(Damodaran 2005) because most of their value comes from their growth assets\n16\n\n and is not \n\nreflected in the current account statements. Using balance sheet-based techniques would \n\ndisclose over conservative estimatives of value (Fern\u00e1ndez 2007c). \n\nNevertheless, Bhojraj &amp; Lee (2002) observe that it?s commonly used approach when valuing \n\nreal estate and distressed firms. \n\nSome examples to approach value through these techniques are: the book value, the \n\nadjusted book value, the residual income and the liquidation value, as referred by \n\nDamodaran (2005) and Fern\u00e1ndez (2007c). Since they were not considered as valuation \n\nmethods for the purpose of this dissertation, I will not further develop this topic.  \n\n2.2.1.3 Relative Valuation  \n\nAlso known as the multiples approach, relative valuation is an income statement-based \n\nmethod, where the value of any asset is priced based upon how similar assets are priced in \n\nthe market (Damodaran 2005). It implicitly assumes that the other firms in the industry are \n\ncomparable to the firm being valued and that the market, on average, prices them correctly \n\n(Damodaran 2002). \n\nAccording to Lie &amp; Lie (2002), it demands calculating particular multiples for a set of \n\ncomparable companies (peer group) and then finding the implied value of the company of \n\ninterest, based on the benchmark multiples. This value is estimated by multiplying the \n\nmultiple by the relevant financial figure of the company under valuation. \n\nIt?s usually used as a supplement to DCF in a second stage of valuation (Lie &amp; Lie 2002) \n\nwhere it can be helpful to test plausibility and accuracy of the cash flows forecasts, to explain \n\ndifferences among the companies? performance and to generate additional insights into value \n\ncreating factors (Koller et al. 2005). Furthermore it?s also a valid method to use when \n\ncomputing the terminal value or even when valuing minority interests, according to Koller et \n\nal. (2005).  \n\n                                                \n16\n\n The investments that the business is expected to make in the future (Damodaran 2005). \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         21 \n\n \n\nNevertheless, in the words of Fern\u00e1ndez (2001), it?s a highly questionable method, guardian \n\nof a broad dispersion since it?s too affected by one-time events, rarely accounts for future \n\nevents and handles the companies? risk differences based on rules-of-thumb. \n\nThere is an infinite number of multiples (Koller et al. 2005) but Fern\u00e1ndez (2001) categorizes \n\nthem into three major groups: i) multiples based on the equity value \u2013 such as PER, \n\nPrice/Sales, Price/Book Value, Price/Output; ii) multiples based on the company?s value \u2013 \n\nsuch as EV/EBITDA, EV/Sales, EV/FCF and iii) growth-referenced multiples \u2013 such as PER \n\nto EPS Growth, EV/EBITDA Growth, along with others. \n\nAlthough there is no consensus as to which multiple performs best (Lie &amp; Lie 2002), \n\nFern\u00e1ndez (2001) identifies PER and EV/EBITDA among the most popular ones. On the \n\nother side, Koller et al. (2005) refer that  EV multiples can be preferable since they minimize \n\nthe effects of the capital structure and non-operating items, unlike PER for example. \n\nNonetheless, Fern\u00e1ndez (2001) argues that the multiples selection should be made \n\nconsidering the company and the industry unique characteristics. \n\n \n\nThe peer group  \n\nDespite the apparent simplicity, the selection of the comparable firms can be a source of \n\nmanipulation, threatening the model?s credibility (Bhojraj &amp; Lee 2002).  \n\nBesides excluding the \u201cabnormal\u201d firms, Koller et al. (2005) defend that the selection of pure \n\nplay proxies firms should be made, adjusting for differences across assets and considering \n\nsimilar prospects for the expected growth rates, returns on invested capital, capital structures \n\nand also the SIC\n17\n\n  codes or the GICS\n18\n\n system. \n\nRecognizing the difficulty in practice to measure all these aspects in the potential peer group, \n\nDamodaran (2005) observes that most analysts consider comparables firms as the ones in \n\nthe same business or businesses, i.e., based on the industry classification, and then adjust \n\ntheir sample according to other factors such as size.  \n\n2.2.1.4 Contingent Claim Valuation  \n\nThe contingent claim valuation is the only valuation approach that accounts for the value of \n\nmanagerial flexibility (Koller et al. 2005), i.e., the value obtained from the possibility that \n\nmanagers have to postpone decisions and to do the best when the time comes, based on \n\nmarket evolution (Luehrman 1997a).  \n\n                                                \n\n17\n The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code list which contains a system that classifies and clusters economic activities \n\ninto specific industries, in order to facilitate comparison.

The \n\nprices obtained are the payoffs which are contingent on the occurrence of specific events.  \n\nSince almost all corporate liabilities can be viewed as combinations of options (Black &amp; \n\nScholes 1973), it?s seen as a promising approach in the context of valuation (Luehrman \n\n1997a). \n\nNotwithstanding, Koller et al. (2005) emphasize that it?s more suitable when valuing \n\ncompanies with a single product, companies in a commodity-based industry\n20\n\n \u2013 that deal, for \n\nexample with investments in oil and gas fields, refining facilities, chemical plants and power \n\ngenerators -, companies in (or near) distress or even in high-technology firms, since the most \n\nvaluable things these firms generally own are golden business opportunities. \n\nIn financial terms, these opportunities are similar to options (Luehrman 1997a), and to value \n\nthem there are basically two techniques (Koller et al. 2005): the Black-Scholes Option Pricing \n\nModel (BSOPM) and the Decision Tree Analysis (DTA), focused on the binominal model. \n\nDespite the fact that the BSOPM is theoretically superior to DTA (Koller et al. 2005), none \n\ncan replace conventional DCF since valuing an option still requires knowing the value of the \n\nunderlying assets, typically not simply observable. Consequently, Luehrman (1997a) defends \n\nthat this approach should be used as a supplement for the valuation methodology already in \n\nuse.  \n\nFor the purpose of this dissertation only the BSOPM will be here clarified. A brief explanation \n\nof the Binominal model is in Appendix 2. \n\n \n\n2.2.1.4.1The background reasoning \n\nIn the words of Luehrman (1997a), an option\n21\n\n is a contract which provides the holder with \n\nthe right \u2013 but not the obligation \u2013 to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an underlying asset \n\n(S) at a specific price (strike or exercise price - X) on or before some future date (expiration \n\nor maturity date). For that right, the buyer pays a call price.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n19\n\n The financial options are based on assets which are traded, such as warrants.

But as the quantity is typically known, their value ends up being  \n\nalmost entirely a function of the movements of the commodity price.  \n\nAs a consequence, very uncertain earnings and cash flows are expected. When commodity \n\nprices are on the upswing, all companies that produce that commodity benefit, whereas \n\nduring a downturn, the opposite happens (Damodaran 2009). \n\nFurthermore, since managers get to observe the commodity price before they make \n\ndecisions, as the reserve value rises and falls, the owner of the reserve will compare the \n\nvalue to the cost of developing\n24\n\n the reserve and will only develop it if the value exceeds the \n\ndevelopment cost, what can be compared to valuing a call option (Damodaran 2009).  \n\nThe potential payoff is as illustrated below:  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Damodaran (2009) \n\nAccording to Dickens &amp; Lohrenz (1996), Paddock et al.

On one hand the aim is to capture value in the Refining &amp; \n\nMarketing and Gas &amp; Power business segments (downstream business) by vertical \n\nintegration and, on the other hand, the purpose is to turn the company into an important \n\nupstream operator taking advantage of the portfolio of valuable E&amp;P assets that the company \n\nowns, mainly in Angola and Brazil?s pre-salt Santos Basin.    \n\nUntil the end of 2011, the main focus will be on the R&amp;M segment with the refinaries \n\nupgrade. From 2012, a more efficient downstream business will be in place and will serve as \n\nthe funding source for the upstream development, which will absorb the biggest pie of the \n\ncompany investments and will be the main source of value for the future from that year on.  \n\nIn the medium and long term, the increasing production achieved will strengthen Galp?s \n\nposition as an integrated oil &amp; gas operator, promoting an increment in cash flows and \n\nturnning Brazil into the key focus of the company long term strategy. \n\nAppendix 6 exhibits a more detailed overview of the strategy splitted along the business \n\nareas and in Appendix 7, a summary of the company?s historical performance can be found. \n\n  \n\n3.2 The oil &amp; gas industry \n\nThe petroleum is amongst the world?s primary sources of energy production.

Macroeconomic environment \n\nAccording to IMF (2011a), the world is currently facing an intense deceleration and its \n\nrecovery is at risk. The main reasons behind it are: on one hand, the Euro sovereign crisis \n\ncaused by the elevated public debts, banking sector problems and a slow growth in the euro \n\narea and, on the other hand, the economic slowdown in the United States (due to the credit \n\ndowngrade), the impact of the tragic March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan (which \n\nled to a broad-based decline in global manufacturing and exports growth across Asia), as \n\nwell as the unstable situation in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region - Egipt, \n\nTunisia, Libya, Iran and Bahrein -  and the related impact in oil prices. \n\nIn this context, the investor?s risk aversion and the employments rate increased as well as \n\nthe world?s financial instability, lowering the propension to consumption and turning the \n\nglobal activity severely unbalanced.  \n\nThe experts previsions have been revised downwards and the world real GDP growth is \n\nexpected to be around 4% in 2011 and 2012 (IMF 2011). In Europe, the growth is expected \n\nto be lower i.e., 2,3% in 2011 and 1,8% in 2012 (IMF 2011). Nevertheless, since countries \n\nsuch as Germany and Sweden were barely affected by the turmoil, and others such as \n\nIreland, Portugal, Greece and Italy were strongly influenced by it, their GDP growth rates will \n\nbe quite differents. Furthermore, recently and due to the high pressures and abrupt cutbacks \n\nin external financing, Ireland, Greece, Portugal and recently Italy were obliged to ask for \n\nexternal financial assistance and are now embarked on an adjustment program supported by \n\nthe EU and the IMF. \n\nIn this context, the portuguese real GDP growth is forecasted to be -2,16 % in 2011 and \u2013\n\n1,84% in 2012 and just after 2013 is forecasted to be out of recession. \n\nTable 6: GDP growth estimates for Portugal \n\nData source: IMF projections [Accessed on 21 December 2011] \n\nFor Spain, the projections antecipate a better outlook until 2014, when compared to the ones \n\nfor Portugal as evidenced in the following table. \n\nTable 7: GDP growth estimates for Spain \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nData source: IMF projections [Accessed on 21 December 2011] \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         35 \n\n \n\n2,65%\n\n-0,90%\n\n1,39%\n\n3,44%\n\n2,11%\n\n1,46%\n\n1,53%\n\n1,55% 1,63%\n\nPortugal\n\nAccording to IMF (2011), the US and China will reemerge relatively quickly from the latest \n\ndownturn; the Eurozone and possibly India will move at a slow pace and the economies of \n\nthe former Soviet Union and Latin America (except Brazil) may not progress so quickly. \n\nIn the major advanced economies such as the United States, euro area, and Japan, the \n\ngrowth is forecasted to rise modestly, from about 0,75% in the first half of 2011 to about \n\n1,5% in 2012, and even higher if the country is predicted to have close ties with emerging \n\nAsia.  \n\nIn emerging and developing economies, the overall economic climate may encourage a \n\nhigher financial regulation with policymakers seeking to increase protectionism, reducing the \n\nallowed capital flows, augmenting the exchange rates, deteriorating terms of tradings and \n\nexports volume, promoting a reduction in foreign demand. This is expected to cut the growth \n\nin these economies from about 7% in the first half of 2011 to about 6 % in 2012 (IMF 2011a). \n\nFurthermore, as a consequence of the recent adverse supply shocks promoted by the \n\npolitical instability in the MENA countries, a rapidly fluctuating crude oil market is now on the \n\nspotlight, the oil prices have been reaching historical maximums and there is no expectation \n\nthat they will be more moderate in the near future since the Iran?s petroleum sector is being \n\nhit with Western sanctions and the European Union is considering a possible embargo on \n\nIranian oil imports suspecting the development of atomic weapons. If the situation \n\ndeteriorates, the oil price\n36\n\n will even exceed those currently predicted by futures markets and \n\nits volatility will influence the GDP growth (OPEC 2010).  \n\nThis instability in the oil prices is also reflected in the countries? inflation levels. Most analysts \n\nexpect the high commodity prices to be temporary and therefore the world?s inflation\n37\n\n is \n\nforecasted to be 2,5% in 2011 and 1,5% in 2012 in more advanced economies and, 7,5% in \n\n2011 and 6% in 2012 in developing countries (IMF 2011a). In Portugal, 2011 is expected to \n\nbe the year with the higher inflation rate as seen in Figure 5. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nData source: IMF [Accessed on 21 December 2011]                 \n\n                                                \n\n36\n Dated Brent is seen as a reference and the best gauge for the direction of oil prices for petroleum production \n\nfrom Europe, Africa and the Middle East.

Valuation of Galp Energia S.G.P.S. \n\n5.1 The valuation methodology \u2013 \u201cthe break-up value\n38\n\n\u201d \n\nGalp Energia is a multi-business company, in which each business segment is distinct in \n\nterms of features and value drivers. To avoid some potential misconceptions, my valuation \n\napproach was made through 4 main steps: \n\n1\nst\n step: I valued each business segment \u2013 E&amp;P, R&amp;M and G&amp;P \u2013 separately and as if they \n\nwere exclusively financed by equity and then those valuation outputs were added up.  \n\n2\nnd \n\nstep: The preceding result was adjusted to report the value of the non-operating assets \n\nand the company?s financing benefits - since the group also relies on external financing \n\nsources, such as banks - and by this manner, I?ve reached the Enterprise Value (EV).  \n\n3\nrd\n step: To achieve the Equity Value, all non equity claims such as the value of debt and \n\nminority interests were subtracted from the EV.  \n\n4\nth\n step: The equity value was divided by the number of shares outstanding and the value per \n\nshare was encountered. \n\nFigure 7: Own valuation methodology \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA more detailed valuation could have been accomplished, considering either the: company?s \n\ndifferent geographic markets, the individual valuation of the group?s subsidiaries and \n\nassociates or the supplementary undeveloped resources in the company?s portfolio, but the \n\nlack of information available, would require me to do entirely groundless and unrealistic \n\n                                                \n38\n\n When the company valuation is made as the sum of the value of different businesses (Fern\u00e1ndez 2007c). \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         38 \n\n \n\n2008 2009 2010 2011 E 2012 E 2013 E 2014 E 2015 E 2016 E\n\nWorld GDP Growth (%) - constant/real prices 2,79 -0,66 5,11 3,96 4,00 4,47 4,69 4,80 4,86\n\nEuropean Union GDP growth (%) - constant/real prices 0,67 -4,21 1,79 1,69 1,39 1,91 2,08 2,11 2,13\n\nPortugal GDP growth (%) - constant/real prices -0,01 -2,51 1,33 -2,16 -1,84 1,19 2,45 2,22 2,00\n\nSpain GDP growth (%) - constant/real prices 0,86 -3,72 -0,15 0,78 1,12 1,77 1,86 1,95 1,85\n\nInflation rate - Portugal (%) 2,65 -0,90 1,39 3,44 2,11 1,46 1,53 1,55 1,63\n\nInflation rate - Spain (%) 4,13 -0,24 2,04 2,87 1,46 1,48 1,56 1,73 1,78\n\nInflation rate - Brazil (%) 5,67 4,90 5,04 6,59 5,15 4,15 4,50 4,53 4,53\n\nassumptions, that would possibly further deviate the obtained value from the reality.

For that reason, I had to account for the EUR/USD exchange rate \n\nevolution, mainly when accessing the value for the E&amp;P segment.  \n\nI considered that the exchange rate will be 1,42 in 2011 and 1,43 in 2012, according to \n\nBanco de Portugal estimates. From 2013 on, I assumed that it would be a value similar to \n\n2012. \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         39 \n\n \n\n2008 2009 2010 2011 E 2012 E 2013 E 2014 E 2015 E 2016 E\n\nDated Brent ($/bbl) 96,7 63,1 79,8 112,0 108,0 112,0 112,0 112,0 112,0\n\nHenry Hub Spot ($/Million of Btu) 4,48 4,50 4,56 4,57 4,66 4,74 4,76 4,81 4,87\n\nFurthermore and as Galp is a commodity company producing and using crude oil and natural \n\ngas as an inputs in its business, the firm?s earnings and value are highly correlated to the \n\nprice fluctuation of these commodities, which are given externally. Table 9 presents my \n\nassumptions. \n\nTable 9: Assumptions \u2013 Brent oil price ($/bbl) and Henry Hub natural gas price ($/Million Btu) \n\nData Source: BdP (2011) for the Dated Brent and Nebraska State Energy Office (NO) for the Henry Hub\n39\n\n prices [Accessed on \n\n21 December 2011]. \n\n5.2.1.2 Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) \n\nThe investment policy is expected to enhance the portfolio of tangible - land and natural \n\nresources, machinery and transport equipment and reusable containers, for example - and \n\nintangible - as R&amp;D Costs and services concession arrangements - fixed assets. \n\nFrom 2011 until 2015, the investment estimatives were made in line with the plan disclosed \n\nby the company.  \n\nIn 2011, Galp plans to spend 1400 million dollars of which 630 million in the R&amp;M segment \u2013 \n\nwith the completion of the upgrade?s project. From 2012 on, the bulk of capital expenditures \n\nwill be redirected to the E&amp;P segment, to the development of projects in the pre-salt Santos \n\nBasin. From 2012 to 2015, I assumed a total spending of 3500 million euros of which 70% \n\nwhere to the upstream activities.  \n\nAfter 2016 and due to the fact that there is slight information about the costs that these kind \n\nof activities require, I assumed that: \n\nFor the E&amp;P Segment \u2013 the investments will be varying across the years. Assumptions were \n\nmade considering the previous years? values released by the company but also the fields \n\ncharacteristics, the number of FPSO?s predicted to be installed, the forecasted inflation rate \n\nand expected timeframe for production.      \n\nFor the R&amp;M and G&amp;P Segments \u2013 the annual investments will increase from the 2015 level \n\nbased on the estimated annual inflation rate and will work as a maintenance CAPEX.  \n\nIn addition and following the past years? results, a residual investment - reported in the \n\ncaption Others - is estimated to be made every year to account for the intra-group?s \n\noperations. In 2011, the value followed the release of the company?s 9 months results. From \n\n2012 on, the projection was based on the historical trend adjusted for the inflation estimated. \n\n                                                \n\n39\n Henry Hub is the pricing point for natural gas futures contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).

In the subsequent table, the results of the \n\ncompany?s activity ratios achieved in the last years, are exhibited.  \n\nTable 12: The Operational efficiency ratios \n\nData source: Company?s historical data and analyst estimates \n\nAfter 2011, the indicated activity ratios and the cash conversion cycle are assumed to remain \n\nequal to the historical average as the company didn?t revealed further informations. \n\nBased on these, I also anticipated the company?s Operating Working Capital as well as its \n\nvariation and considered the results evidenced in Table 13, as inputs to the DCF valuation \n\nmethodology. For the subsequent years, the WC was similarly computed. \n\nTable 13: WC and WCN \u2013 Past results and future outlook \n\nData source: Company?s historical data and analyst estimates \n\n                                                \n40\n\n The least amount of available cash that a company decides to maintain on a regular basis to avoid or cover up cash \nshortfalls resulting from a potential mismatch between cash inflows and outflows during an accounting period. In this case I \nconsidered to be the sum of cash, demand deposits and other negotiable securities included in the caption cash and \nequivalents. The remaining value is accounted as Excess Cash. \n\nhttp://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/amount.html\nhttp://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/cash.html\nhttp://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/maintain.html\nhttp://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/cover.html\nhttp://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/cash-inflow.html\nhttp://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/outflows.html\nhttp://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/accounting-period.html\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         42 \n\n \n\n2008 2009 2010 2011 E 2012 E 2013 E 2014 E 2015 E 2016 E \n\n                Sales &amp; Services RCA by segment (%)\n\n                 Exploration &amp; Production  (E&amp;P)   1% 1% 2% 3% 4% 5% 7% 11% 12%\n\n                 Refining &amp; Marketing  (R&amp;M)             88% 89% 89% 85% 83% 82% 81% 77% 78%\n\n                 Gas &amp; Power (G&amp;P)                          13% 12% 13% 12% 12% 12% 11% 10% 10%\n\n                 Others                                               1% 1% 1% 1% 1% 1% 1% 1% 1%\n\nWCN by segment    (Million \u20ac)\n\n                 Exploration &amp; Production  (E&amp;P)   (5) (2) 4 8 2 4 7 17 6\n\n                 Refining &amp; Marketing  (R&amp;M)             (327) (151) 245 234 49 60 82 114 40\n\n                 Gas &amp; Power (G&amp;P)                          (48) (20) 36 32 7 9 11 15 5\n\n                 Others                                               (3) (2) 3 2 0 1 1 1 0\n\n                Total WCN (Million \u20ac) (373) (170) 277 277 58 73 101 147 52\n\nSince the valuation was made accessing each business segment individually, the working \n\ncapital segmentation had to be made and without any kind of indicative elements I decided \n\non doing it according to the sales volume. \n\nTable 14: Working capital needs \u2013 segmentation, 2009 \u2013 2016 E \n\nData source: Company?s historical data and analyst estimates \n\nAs the sales from the R&amp;M activities are higher than the bulk from the other segments, the \n\nWC for the segment?s maintenance is also expected to be higher and a major positive \n\nvariation is denoted. For more information on the WCN segmentation, consult Appendix 14. \n\nWhen comparing with the activity ratios that serve as a reference for the global sector, and \n\nneglecting the inventories proportions, Galp appears to have below the average results, as \n\ncan be seen in Appendix 15. \n\n5.2.1.5 The Capital Structure  \n\nAt the end of September 2011, the leverage analysis expressed mainly by the debt ratio and \n\nnet-debt to equity ratios indicated that the businesses had too much risk.  \n\nTo manage this situation, the company announced that, in the first quarter of 2012  it will sell \n\na 30% stake of its subsidiary \u2013 Petrogal Brasil, Lda to Sinopec, a chinese company and one \n\nof the largest energy groups worldwide, to raise around 3,77 billion \u20ac. Furthermore Sinopec \n\nwill make a shareholder loan to Petrogal of nearly 306 million \u20ac. \n\nAccording to the same source, these new funding options will allow the group to achieve a \n\nnet debt-to-equity inferior of 50% and net debt-to-EBITDA inferior to 2,5x. \n\nIn this context, I forecasted the debt levels taking into account the previous information and \n\nalso the company needs to meet the operational projections in the explicit period, as see in \n\nTable 15. In Appendix 16, I account for the remaining years. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         43 \n\n \n\nRisk free\nMarket risk \n\npremium\nBeta levered \n\nBeta \n\nunlevered\nTerminal g\n\nRu \n\n(annual)\n\nE&amp;P - Angola 1,85% 9,88% 1,32 0,97 no meaning 11,5%\n\nE&amp;P - Brazil 1,85% 7,63% 1,32 0,99 no meaning 9,4%\n\nR&amp;M 1,85% 7,11% 1,3 0,96 1,0% 8,6%\n\nG&amp;P 1,85% 9,01% 0,62 0,46 1,2% 8,3%\n\n(Million \u20ac) 2008 2009 2010 2011 E 2012 E 2013 E 2014 E 2015 E 2016 E\n\nShort term debt 687 424 616 1.035 570 335 0 0 0\n\nLong term debt 1.304 1.747 2.412 3.268 2.305 1.656 903 822 722\n\nTotal Debt 1.991 2.171 3.028 4.303 2.875 1.991 903 822 722\n\nCash and equivalents 127 244 188 203 510 800 697 677 427\n\nNet Debt 1.864 1.927 2.840 4.100 2.365 1.192 206 144 295\n\nTotal equity 2.219 2.389 2.711 2.559 4.182 5.577 6.858 7.480 8.767\n\nDebt ratio (%) 66% 68% 70% 74% 61% 51% 42% 41% 38%\n\nNet Debt-to-Equity (%) 84% 81% 105% 160% 57% 21% 3% 2% 3%\n\nNet Debt-to-EBITDA 4,2x 2,3x 2,7x 4,5x 1,7x 0,8x 0,1x 0,1x 0,2x\n\nTable 15: Financial situation, 2009 \u2013 2016 E \n\nData source: Company?s historical data and analyst estimates \n\nWith regards to the debt ratio, I foresee an incremental decrease after 2012 due to the \n\nalternative cash coming from Petrogal?s raise in capital. For the same reason and assuming \n\nthat the cash obtained will be received in parcels until 2016, the net debt-to-equity and net \n\ndebt-to-EBITDA ratios will decrease mainly after 2012 converging to the anticipated intervals \n\npreviously described. Until the end of the explicit period, the debt ratio is expected to be \n\nalways inferior to 50%. \n\n5.2.1.6 The Cost of Equity \n\nEach segment was valued considering an individual risk performance in a debt free \n\nenvironment. As a consequence, the cost of capital, i.e., the discount rate used to come \n\nacross the segments? values was the cost of equity, computed throught the CAPM.

Based on this, I used the average levered beta of these companies and adjusted it for \n\nthe company?s capital structure and the countries corporate tax rates, to reach a value for the \n\nsegment?s unlevered beta. \n\nR&amp;M segment: As the company until just recently was mainly focused on this kind of \n\nactivities, I considered that Bloomberg?s beta estimative, based on past performance was \n\nrealistic to account for the R&amp;M business sensitivity to the market performance. \n\nG&amp;P segment: I identified and analyzed a peer group\n42\n\n based on capital strutures, and \n\nROIC?s and considered their average beta as a good indicator for this segment after the \n\nadjustement for Galp?s capital structure.  \n\nTo deleverage the beta and assuming that the Beta of the debt is zero, I used the following \n\nformula:  \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n\n41\n More details about its composition are made in section 5.3. \n\n42\n Utilizing the Damodaran?s industry data base.  \n\n  (27) \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         45 \n\n \n\nwhere:  \n\nBu = Beta unlevered  \n\nBL = Beta levered \n\nTc= Corporate Tax \n\nD/E = Debt/ Equity \n\n \n\nThe terminal growth rate \n\nFor the E&amp;P segment, the number of reserves and resources available to be developed and \n\nextracted are in a limited number. Therefore no growth rate at perpetuity was considered.  \n\nConcerning the R&amp;M business, I considered that the major investment plans were already \n\naccomplished. Moreover, the refining capacity is limited and the utilization rate can only \n\nincrease slightly. A 1% growth rate was estimated to be reasonable to account for this \n\ndoubtful growth at perpetuity since it?s the growth rate expected to be in place in the last \n\nyears of the explicit period.   \n\nThe G&amp;P segment serves as a complement to the refining and marketing activities and the \n\ncompany didn?t reveal any plans to future substancial investment. Nevertheless I considered \n\na 1,2% growth rate since the Galp?s CEO announced that it was the expected growth rate for \n\nthe industy sector after 2012. \n\n  \n\n5.2.1.7 The Cost of Debt  \n\nFollowing the methodology ascribed to Damoradan (2008), the before tax cost of debt of \n\n5,85% was reached considering the following assumptions:  \n\n-  Risk free rate: 1,85% as similarly used when computing the cost of equity. \n\n- Default spread: 4%. On one hand, the historical trend highlighted an average spread of \n\n1,5% while, on the other hand and based on the synthetic rating calculation, the associated \n\nspread was 1,1%. However, in the last year and due to the economic recession the banks? \n\nrisk perception has changed considerably and these values were not reflecting the reality. \n\nFor this reason, and due to the lack of more information, I relied on the average spread \n\nachieved by EDP\n43\n\n when, in January 2011, issued bonds. \n\n5.2.2 Valuation \u2013 E&amp;P business \n\nDespite of the large portfolio of assets that the company owns for exploration and \n\ndevelopment, as already described in Figure 14 (Appendix 6), currently, the real production \n\n                                                \n43\n\n A Portuguese company in the energetic sector that, in January 2011 announced that it would issue 750 million \u20ac in bonds \nmaturing in January 2016,  with an associated 5,875% interest rate.  \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         46 \n\n \n\nof oil and natural gas to Galp Energia has its origin in Kuito, BBLT and CPT in Block 14 \n\n(Angola) where the company has a 9% participation share and in the Lula field in Block BM-\n\nS-11 (located in Santos Basin \u2013 Brazil), where a 10% stake is entitled to Galp. \n\nTo access the value of the segment, I considered, besides the previous ones, the other E&amp;P \n\nassets that are or have already been under the exploration phase and consequently are \n\nready to be developed and productive. \n\nAccording to the disclosed information, the next in line to be under development are: \n\n? Cernambi, Iara and Jupiter in Block BM-S-11; Bem-te-vi in BM-S-8 and Caramba in \n\nBM-S-21 \u2013 located in Brazil. \n\n? Negage, Malange and Menongue in Block 14; Lianzi in Block 14K-A-IMI; Block 32 \n\nand Block 33 \u2013 placed in Angola. \n\nFurthermore recently, the company announced the discovery of a new hydrocarbon province \n\nin Mozambique - Mamba South-1, in Area 4 - with at least 15 Tcf\n44\n\n of recoverable natural \n\ngas. However, as residual information was released to the market, it was not considered for \n\nthis valuation purpose. \n\nPre-exploration reserves were also not valued as no informations concerning the reserves in \n\nplace, the development costs and the required investments were availabe.  \n\n \n\nValuation techniques: \n\nEach Brazilian field was valued separately using the DCF methodology in order to get a \n\nsuitable value per barrel. Since the company divulged the number of barrels that each field is \n\nexpected to have, the total value of the reserve was encountered. \n\nThe Angolan area was valued similarly but it was analyzed as a whole and not discriminated \n\nby field, as the company did not provide detailed information.  \n\nAdditionally and following Damodaran (2009), I?ve accessed the yet undeveloped fields using \n\nthe Option Pricing Theory to pull out the extra value that comes from the options - such as to \n\naccelerate or postpone the development and extraction stage\n45\n\n according to the economic \n\nperspectives at the time - that the field operator\n46\n\n might have, since it?s a natural resource. \n\nFor this matter, I had to account for the projects? main sources of uncertainty at this stage - \n\nthe recovery rate and the development and extraction costs - which are highly correlated to \n\nthe oil and gas prices volatility. In this case, and based on the information of future contracts, \n\nan implied volatility of 25,45% in oil prices and 16% in gas prices was assumed.   \n\n                                                \n44\n\n Trillion of cubic feet.

The production profile, \n\nby its turn, was a result of the analysis of the production report in the last 3 years as a \n\ncomplement to the industry historical prodution profiles in major oil fields. \n\nFor the Brazilian fields the main costs considered were: an OPEX of 9,6 $ per barrel, \n\naccording to the figures released by Petrobras; a 10% Royalties tax and a Special \n\nParticipation Tax (SPT) that is owned by the leaseholder to the State and that oscillates \n\naccording to the production volume in each year. \n\nFor the Angolan fields, the scenario is a bit different. Instead of taxes, the company has to \n\ntransfer part of its total production \u2013 called Working Interest Production (WIP) - to the State \n\nand it?s only able to sell the remaining, which is called the Net entitlement Production (NET). \n\nHistorically the NET has been around 67% of the WIP and I maintained that ratio for the \n\nfuture to forecast the field? s production which will be sold. Furthermore an OPEX of 5,5 $ per \n\nbarrel was considered. \n\nThe D&amp;A of the segment were allocated to each field in proportion of the CAPEX invested in \n\nit. \n\nIn what concerns to corporate taxation, a tax rate of 34% and 28% were the assumptions for \n\nthe Brazilian upstream assets and for the Angolan ones, respectively. \n\nThe segment value is nearly 14,9 billion \u20ac. It worths 66% of EV, or in other words, 17,92\u20ac per \n\nshare. The segment?s EV is 79,9 times its 2010 EBITDA. \n\n    \n\nThe value drivers: \n\nThe value of the segment is highly correlated to the cost of capital and the amount of \n\nreserves owned by the company. Any future discoveries on the amount of resources and \n\nreserves that are available to the company will positively update the actual E&amp;P valuation \n\nand might also push the value per barrel of each field up. \n\nNonetheless, the business it?s even more sensitive to changes in the Brent oil Price ($/bbl) \n\nand in the EUR/USD exchange rate. \n\n5.2.3 Valuation \u2013 R&amp;M business \n\nValuation technique: \n\nA DCF was the valuation methodology chosen and the segment was valued as a whole. \n\n \n\n                                                \n47\n\n In Brazil, a 9% discount on oil price was considered (Source: Petrobras) while in Angola, 3% was the assumed price cut \n\n(Source: IEA) \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         49 \n\n \n\nR&amp;M  Assumptions 2008 2009 2010 2011 E 2012 E 2013 E 2014 E 2015 E\n\n2016 E \n\nand the \n\nfollow in\n\ng years\n\nAverage Benchmark Refining \n\nMargin ($/bbl) \n\n2,00 0,91 1,18 (0,47) 1,00 1,62 1,62 1,62 1,62\n\nGalp's Refining margin ($/bbl) 4,40 1,5 2,60 0,92 6,52 7,14 7,14 7,14 7,14\n\nGalp refining capacity (kbbl/d) 310 310 310 310 330 330 330 330 330\n\nCapacity utilization (%) 79% 69% 75% 70% 78% 85% 90% 90% 75%\n\nCash costs ($/bbl) 2,2 2,1 2,1 3,3 2,1 2,1 2,1 2,1 2,1\n\nOPERATING HIGHLIGHTS 2008 2009 2010 2011 E 2012 E 2013 E 2014 E 2015 E 2016 E 2020 E 2025 E 2030 E 2035 E 2040 E 2045 E 2048 E\n\nProcessed crude (k bbl/d) 245 213 232 218 257 281 314 297 248 248 248 248 248 248 248 248\n\nProcessed crude (k bbl) 89.808 77.624 84.700 79.442 93.951 102.383 114.428 108.405 90.338 90.338 90.338 90.338 90.338 90.338 90.338 90.338\n\nRefining EBITDA (M \u20ac) 134 (33) 32 (99) 290 361 403 382 318 318 318 318 318 318 318 318\n\nMarketing EBITDA (M \u20ac) 406 326 362 370 375 386 401 416 431 497 595 712 853 1.021 1.221 1.360\n\nSegment assumptions and results: \n\nTable 19: R&amp;M \u2013 Key assumptions  \n\nData source: Company?s historical data and analyst estimates \n\nIn the last years, the international benchmark refining margins have been decreasing and as \n\na result, the company?s refining margin has also been very low. Faced with the current \n\neconomic climate, I assumed that for 2011, the refining margin would follow the trend of the \n\nresults in the first three quarters of that year and that in 2012, it would rise to an average of \n\n1$ per barrel. Galp also released an information that from 2011 to 2015, an average \n\nbenchmark margin of 1,62 $/bbl would be expected which I only assumed to happen from \n\n2013 on, to be more conservative.  \n\nIn what concerns to the company?s refining margin, a boost of 3,5 dollars per barrel is \n\nexpected after the end of the refinaries? upgrade project. Furthermore and considering an \n\naverage spread of 2,02 $/bbl and a cost of 2,1 $/bbl, Galp will be able to solidify the \n\nsegments? gains. \n\nAdditionally, the capacity utilization will increase until 2013 and then will decrease coming to \n\na period where it will stabilize to a standard 75%, in line to what is hoped to happen in the \n\nindustry. As a consequence, the processd crude and, as a result, the sales, are expected to \n\naugment in the first years of the projection and then will become quite constant. \n\nThe processed crude is a product of the refining capacity and its actual utilization. The \n\namount of sales is then a function of the processed crude and the company?s refining margin. \n\nIn what respects the Marketing division, the increase in sales is positively correlated to the \n\nIberian inflation rate and its costs are expected to be 97% of the sales, as the past years \n\nresults have showed.

In the prices drops, the value will also diminish.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn what concerns to the exchange rate, an negative correlation exists. A dollar devaluation \n\ncauses a higher inflation and decreases the oil supply, the drilling activities, the oil demand \n\nand the purchasing power in the producing countries.

Nevertheless, it was quite an \n\nunproductive job since none of them was truly similar to Galp Energia. \n\nFor that reason, in a second phase, I searched for integrated petroleum companies that \n\ndespite their location, could be more pure proxies to Galp and used them as the peer group. \n\nThe next table compares the two groups just above described, with Galp. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nData source: Damodaran database \n\nAs it?s possible to verify, Galp has a much lower market capitalization and ROIC, a distict \n\ncapital structure and higher growth perspectives when compared to most of the potential \n\ncomparable firms from Western Europe and from this point of view, it?s entirely a distinct \n\ncompany.  \n\nWhen compared to the peer group, it?s less atypical and so the multiples reasoning can be \n\napplied. The next table gathers the multiples from: Galp, the peer group and the industry \n\naverage. Since companies such as Galp and the peer group emerge to be quite different \n\nfrom the bigger companies in the sector, I also present their multiples. \n\n \n\n                                                \n49\n\n \u201cIndividual company information\u201d (January 2012), available at http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/ \n\nTable 35: Peer group \u2013 Integrated oil &amp; gas companies \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         58 \n\n \n\nEV/EBIT EV/EBITDA Trailing PER Forward PER\n\nWestern Europe\n\nBG 12,2x 10,5x 18,9x 15,8x\n\nTotal 4,1x 3,6x 7,2x 7,3x\n\nENI 5,0x 3,4x 9,2x 7,0x\n\nAverage 7,7x 5,7x 10,3x 10,2x\n\nPeer group considered\n\nContinental Resources Inc 38,3x 22,5x 24,8x 26,7x\n\nHess Corp. 6,7x 4,0x 9,8x 9,0x\n\nRepsol-YPF ADR 6,9x 4,4x 7,9x n.a .\n\nMurphy Oil Corp. 7,4x 4,1x 10,0x 9,4x\n\nAverage 14,8x 8,8x 13,1x 15,0x\n\nIndustry average\n\nOil &amp; Gas - E&amp;P 6,1x 4,0x - -\n\nOil &amp; Gas - R&amp;M 6,2x 4,8x - -\n\nOil &amp; Gas Storage and Transportation 12,4x 8,6x - -\n\nAverage 8,3x 5,8x - -\n\nDamodaran Galp Energia S.G.P.S. 18,1x 13,3x 19,3x 24,7x\n\nTable 36: The multiples comparison \u2013 Galp, peer group and industry average \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nData source: Damodaran \n\nThe major conclusion is that even when compared to the average multiples of identical \n\ncompanies, Galp trades at higher multiples. Although they are all integrated petroleum \n\ncompanies, their mix of businesses and specific characteristics are not similar among them \n\nand so the company?s multiples, should be adjusted to account for those differences.  \n\nDue to the recent sharp increases in the oil price, the companies mostly involved in the \n\nexploration and drilling activities evidence higher EV?s and consequently higher implied \n\nmultiples. This is the case of Galp, which was until recently mostly a dowstream player and \n\nhas just emerged to be a promising player in the upstream activities, due to its exciting \n\nportfolio of E&amp;P assets. As a result, the Galp?s implied multiples incorporate assets that do \n\nnot yet produce operating income and the potential value from the E&amp;P segment increased \n\nas well as the overall company EV.  \n\nFurthermore, it?s not accurate to compare them with the companies that worth less, either \n\nbecause they have a potential lower value from E&amp;P assets, or because there are more \n\nfocused on other activities of the value chain.  \n\nNevertheless the valuation results using the multiples approach, more specifically \n\nEV/EBITDA and PER\n50\n\n, are presented next: \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n50\n\n As recommended by Fern\u00e1ndez (2001). \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         59 \n\n \n\nEV/EBITDA PER\n\n2010 24,7x\n\n2011 E 51,3x\n26,9x\n\nGalp Energia \n\nimplied multiple \n\n(own valuation)\n\nTable 37: Relative valuation output \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nI can say that the previous valuation outputs indicate the minimum value that Galp would \n\nworth if it was similar to the peer group companies considered.  \n\nThe difference between the firms is again undeniable when, in Table 38, the implicit multiples \n\nobtained through my valuation approach are presented.  \n\nTable 38: Implied multiples resulting from my valuation approach \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5.4  Financial Outlook \u2013 complementary remarks \n\nThe financial estimatives for Galp Energia?s P&amp;L, Cash Flow Statement and Balance Sheet \n\nare summarized in Appendix 20. \n\nNevertheless, I would like to add the following comments: \n\nIn terms of sales, and despite the fact that the ones from the E&amp;P operations will increase \n\nsubstancially from 2011 on, the bulk is still expected to come from the refining and marketing \n\nactivities. In Appendix 22, a table with the projected company sales by segment is offered. \n\nThe amount of  costs in the income statement was calculated by segment and considering \n\ntheir historical percentage over sales.  \n\nThe company is expected to increase its EBITDA margin, ROS and ROE on a yearly basis \n\nmainly after 2011. The ROE is even expected to be higher than the required return to \n\ninvestors for at least a decade after 2012. \n\nDespite of the great amount of investments expected to be made, the firm will give back a \n\nhigher return on capital invested (when compared to the past results) and is likely to be \n\nfinancially healthy with, a D/E ratio below 50% as exposed in section 5.2.1.5. and a solvency \n\nratio below 30% (Appendix 21). \n\nUntil the 2013, the company predicts to pay a 0,20\u20ac dividend per share what corresponded \n\nto a dividend payout ratio of 38% in 2010. For the following years, I assumed a higher \n\ndividend payout ratio -  Galp will distribute 50% of the net income at replacement cost until \n\n2034 (in line with the dividend policy that was in place until 2009) and 80% of it after 2035. \n\n2010 2011 E 2010 2011 E\n\nEV (M\u20ac) 9.266 7.984 6.615 3.166\n\nEquity Value (M\u20ac) 6.426 3.884 9.455 7.267\n\nShare Price (\u20ac) 7,75 \u20ac 4,68 \u20ac 7,98 \u20ac 3,82 \u20ac\n\nEV/EBI TDA = 8,8X PER = 15X\n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         60 \n\n \n\nFurthermore the half yearly interim dividends payment will occur and will be equal to 50% of \n\nthe previous annual dividend. \n\nThe agreement made with Sinopec to sell 30% of Petrogal, is expected to be finalized in the \n\nfirst months of 2012.

Valuation Comparison \u2013 Caixa IB and Millennium IB \n\nIn this section, I present the main findings that were achieved when I put side by side my \n\nvaluation methodology and the ones used in recent equity researchs from Caixa BI and \n\nMillennium IB\n51\n\n. \n\nWhile Milllennium IB valued Galp at 18,15\u20ac per share, Caixa IB settled the value of each \n\nstock to 18,7\u20ac. In comparison, my approach yielded the most conservative value, reaching a \n\nlower equity value and value per share (14,76\u20ac).  \n\nThe main cause was the adjustment that I?ve made to the EV considering a higher level of \n\nminority interests\n52\n\n as a result of the Petrogal?s selling operation and which was not equally \n\naccounted by these analysts. Additionally, I considered a relatively higher level of debt and I \n\ndid not account for a debt reduction since my assumption was that the cash-in obtained with \n\nthis operation would be the financial support to Galp?s future investments. \n\nOn the other side, while Millennium BCP did not account for any of these changes, the \n\nanalyst from Caixa IB assumed that the monetization of these Brazilian assets would be \n\nused to reduce the current amount of debt outstanding.   \n\nTable 39: Valuation output \u2013 own valuation, Caixa BI and Millennium IB \n\n \n\nAmong all, the predominant valuation method was the DCF. Nevertheless the other analysts \n\nalso used the multiples approach to value essentially the G&amp;P business segment. \n\n                                                \n51\n\n Although my purpose was to also examine a report from a foreign investment bank - BofA Merrill Lynch, that was not possible \nsince insufficient information was disclosed by the analyst. \n52\n\n For this purpose, a sensitivity analysis on the value of minority interests is made in  \nAppendix 19. \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         62 \n\n \n\nOwn Valuation Millennium IB - 1 September 2011 Caixa IB  - 28 November 2011\n\nAngola - Ru = \n\n11,5%         \n\n(Rf=1,85%; Market \n\nRisk \n\nPremium=9,88%; \n\nBeta U=0,97)                                         \n\nAngola - Re = 13,8%                                 \n\n(Rf=3% ; Country Risk Premium = 4%; \n\nMarket Risk Premium=5%; Beta = 1,2)                                         \n\nBrazil - Ru=8%          \n\n(Rf=1,85%; Market \n\nRisk \n\nPremium=7,63%; \n\nBeta U=0,99)  \n\nBrazil - Re=10,8%                                          \n\n(Rf=3% ; Countrty Risk Premium=1,5% \n\n; Market Risk Premium=5%; Beta = \n\n1,2)  \n\nWACC = 14,97%                                 \n\n(Rf=3% ; Country Risk Premium = 7%; \n\nMarket Premium=5%; Beta = 1,30; Re= \n\n18,65%) + (D/E= 30%, Rd= 6,39% )                                    \n\nRefining - WACC=7,4%                                 \n\n(Rf=4,5% ; Market Premium=4%; \n\nBeta = 1,2; D/E=67%)                                    \n\nTerminal Value WACC = 8,24%                                 \n\n(Rf=3% ; Country Risk Premium = \n\n0,5%; Market Premium=5%; Beta = \n\n1,3; Re=10,17%) + (D/E= 30%; \n\nRd=3,73%)                                    \n\n   Marketing - WACC=7,3%                                 \n\n(Rf=4,5% ; Market Premium=4%; \n\nBeta = 1 ; D/E=43%)\n\nGas distribution - WACC=8,37%                                 \n\n(Rf=3% ; Country Risk Premium = 7%; \n\nMarket Premium=5%; Beta = 1,34; \n\nRe=19,13%) + (D/E=80%; Rd=5,68%)       \n\nGas Supply - WACC = 14,92%                                 \n\n(Rf=3% ; Country Risk Premium = 7%; \n\nMarket Premium=5%; Beta = 1,3; \n\nRe=18,65% ) + (D/E=30%; Rd=6,21%)       \n\nT.

Their betas are generally superior as they account for the risk of leverage \n\nand a special attention also goes to their higher assumptions of the risk-free rate. \n\nFurthermore, Millennium IB offers the most exhaustive study and thoroughly accounts for \n\nindividual discount rates considering segments and subsegments.  \n\n \n\nIn  this context, I will now highlight the main drivers that guided the overall valuation outputs \n\nin each business segment.

The analysts did not account for the options value in these kind of activities. \n\n? For the projections, Millennium IB assumed a constant oil price of 100$ per barrel, a \n\ngas price of 7,65$ per million of btu and an exchange rate of 1,40. Caixa IB relied on \n\nlower levels, i.e., a price per barrel of 85$, a gas price of 4,2$ per million of btu and \n\nan exchange rate of 1,34. My projections can be seen on Table 9.   \n\nIn this context, each field was valued individually and distinct NPV?s ($ per barrel) per field, \n\nwere accomplished: \n\n \n\n? In what concerns to the CAPEX and production profile, Caixa IB did not disclosed the \n\ninformation of its assumptions. As a result I will just compare my projections to the \n\nones from Millennium IB. \n\n \n\nFor the R&amp;M activities: \n\nThere is not much relevant differences in what concerns to the assumptions for the company \n\nrefining margin since all analysts position it in a similar interval range. When compare to \n\nMillennium, I assumed a lower cash cost per barrel. Adding to the comparatively regular \n\nassumptions for the processed crude, I ended up with higher level for the segment?s \n\nprojected EBITDA. In what concerns to the segment?s investments, Millennium assumed a \n\nsimilar CAPEX effort, when compared with my own valuation.

I assumed that there will be heavier investments in the \n\nsegment, when compared the other analysts. My revenues and EBITDA forecast are also \n\nslightly inferior. \n\n \n\nTo sum up, I would like to say that despite the fact that each analyst have pursued different \n\npaths to account to the company?s value, the divergence between the final results has to do \n\nmainly with the different assumptions made by each one especially in what concerns the key \n\nvalue drivers. Otherwise the final value would be analogous. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 43: R&amp;M  assumptions \u2013 own valuation, Millennium IB and CAIXA IB \n\nTable 44: G&amp;P \u2013 Revenues, EBITDA and CAPEX \u2013 own valuation, Millennium IB and CAIXA IB \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         65 \n\n \n\n7. Conclusion  \n\nValuing companies is a complex subject where is not possible to establish a unique path or \n\nmethodology to execute it. Furthermore, each valuation output is simply a result of the \n\nanalyst set of judgments on the company future expected development. \n\nIn this dissertation, the value of Galp Energia S.G.P.S. was accessed through the Sum-of-\n\nthe-parts (SoP) methodology using mainly two valuation approaches -  the Discounted Cash \n\nflow method and the Black and Scholes model to value options.  \n\nMoreover, the results were cross-checked with the average industry implied multiples to \n\nbetter understand the SoP results. The conclusion was that for Galp, fundamental DCF \n\nvaluation is a much more powerful tool when compared to relative valuation. Due to the \n\nGalp?s characteristics and current market conditions, the company trades to a premium to the \n\nsector. \n\nThe company?s current value driver is the E&amp;P business with a promising exploration \n\nportfolio held in Angola and in Brazil (Santos Basin). Nevertheless, this segment is also the \n\nbiggest source of uncertainty for the firm, since it?s highly sensitive to changes in the \n\nmacroeconomic variables such as the Brent oil price and the euro/dollar exchange rate. \n\nThe dowstream activities are projected to become a complement to the E&amp;P activities, \n\ncontrary to what have been happing so far. A special focus goes to the R&amp;M business that is \n\nexpected to become a cash cow and an important funding source to the upstream \n\ndevelopments.  \n\nThe main issue to be followed in the near future is the partnership deal with Sinopec to sell \n\n30% of the company?s subsidiary, Petrogal Brazil. This operation will, on one hand, wipe out \n\nthe company?s short term funding issues allowing it to grow in a more sustained way and, on \n\nthe other hand, diminish the company?s value attributable to the equityholders. \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n     \n\n  \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         66 \n\n \n\n8.

After that, there are three stages before hydrocarbons can be \n\nobtained above the ground: exploration, development and extraction (Paddock et al. 1988) \u2013 \n\nwhat are generally called Exploration and Production (E&amp;P) or upstream activities. \n\nThe exploration stage involves seismic and drilling activity to obtain information on the \n\nquantities of hydrocarbon reserves present in that tract, as well as the costs of bringing them \n\nout. Only if the exploration results are favorable, the firm may then proceed to the \n\ndevelopment stage, which involves putting the equipment in place to extract the oil, such as: \n\nconstructing platforms and drilling production wells. These development expenditures \n\nconvert undeveloped reserves into developed reserves and prepare for the extraction phase \n\nwhere barrels of oil and gas equivalent are produced.   \n\nIn a next phase, the barrels are transported through infrastructures such pipelines, access to \n\nroads, rails and ports and storaged to be refined into usable products such as gasoline and \n\ndiesel. Then they are distributed onwards to wholesale, retail or direct industrial clients \u2013 \n\nFigure 10: The petroleum value chain \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         68 \n\n \n\nthrough what is known as Refining and Marketing (R&amp;M) or downstream activities (Wolf &amp; \n\nTordo 2009).  \n\nThe same authors note that the transport and storage operations have a massive weight \n\nwithin the value chain linking production, processing facilities and the final customer. For that \n\nreason, they refer that these activities could be distinguished as the midstream part of the \n\nvalue chain, in spite of being usually included in the downstream point of view. For this \n\ndissertation purpose, the downstream operations include these midstream activities. \n\nA final remark goes to the fact that the upstream activities entail higher investments that can \n\nbe offset with the possibility of achieving higher profits while in the downstream activities the \n\nrisk is relatively low and there is a possibility of moderate earnings despite the colateral \n\nlosses from the fluctuant benchmark refining margins in international markets.   \n\n \n\nGeographically speaking, Galp Energia has a strong presence in almost all the world: \n\nThe E&amp;P activities are placed predominantly in Brazil, Angola, Mozambique Venezuela and \n\nUruguay. \n\nThe R&amp;M operations are located mostly in Portugal and Spain, although some clients are \n\nplaced in Africa and North America. \n\nThe G&amp;P segment is mainly associated with Nigeria and Angelia, in the North of Africa, since \n\nthese are the main suppliers of natural gas. In the beginning of 2009, a LNG project in \n\nEquatorial Guinea started being designed. \n\nThe following figure illustrates what has been said. \n\nSource: Company website \n\nAppendix 4: The company\u2019s activities around the globe \n\nFigure 11: Galp Energia \u2013 presence worldwide \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         69 \n\n \n\nAppendix 5: Galp\u2019s base of resources &amp; the petroleum classification system \n\nThe current resource base \n\nAccording to the company, the intense exploration work that has been developed in the \n\nrecent years, particularly in the Brazilian Santos basin, led to an considerable enlargement of \n\nGalp?s base of resources and reserves.  \n\nPresently the company publicizes that nearly 2,4 billion of barrels of oil and natural gas can \n\nbe encountered in its porfolio. Furthermore, if we also account for the prospective resources, \n\nthe 2P reserves in Angola and the 3P reserves in Brazil, the total resource base is estimeted \n\nto be around 5,88 billion boe, which considering a production level of 200 thousand boe per \n\nday is equivalent to around 80 years of production. In Figure 12, it?s possible to see the \n\nevolution of the company?s resource base along the years. \n\nSource: Company website \n\n \n\nThe petroleum classification system  \n\nAccording to the definitions approved by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) and by \n\nthe World Petroleum Council (WPC), the total petroleum (which includes crude oil, \n\ncondensates, natural gas and related substances) dispersed around the globe can be \n\nclassified as Reserves - Proved (1P), Probable (2P) and Possible (3P) - or as potentially \n\nrecoverable hydrocarbon volumes beyond Reserves, which are known as Resources \u2013 \n\nProspective or Contingent. \n\nIn theory, each quantity of petroleum starts as being a Prospective Resources. Dependent of \n\nthe company disclosures along the time, these Prospective Resources are likely then, to be \n\nclassified in Contingent Resources and later in Probable and Proved Reserves.  \n\n \n\nFigure 12: Galp Energia \u2013 Reserves and resources  \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         70 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Company website \n\nTo better understand Figure 13 and according to the SPE, the WPC and the company \n\nwebsite: \n\nProspective resources are quantities of petroleum that have, on a certain date, been \n\nestimated as potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application of \n\nfuture development projects. The estimation of the resources quantities of a prospect is \n\nsubject to both technical and commercial uncertainties.  \n\nContingent resources consign quantities of petroleum that have, on a certain date, been \n\nestimated as potentially recoverable from known reservoirs but that are not commercially \n\nrecoverable yet. The maturity stage of the project (the discovery needs further appraisals to \n\nsupport for the development plan), technical issues (new technology needs to be developed \n\nand tested) or issues related with the market (the sales contracts are not yet in place or the \n\ninfrastructure needs to be built in order to take the product to the clients) appear as reasons \n\nfor this classification. \n\nWhen the previous phases have been overcome and there is already a development plan in \n\nplace, the discovered petroleum is renamed to fit in one of the following three categories:  \n\nProved, Probable and Possible reserves (3P) are a category of unproved reserves and \n\ncorrespond to the addition of proved, probable and possible reserves.  \n\nThese reserves are based on geological or engineering data similar to those used in the \n\ncalculation of proved reserves but entail technical, contractual, economic or regulatory \n\nuncertainties and therefore are not classified as proven. The possible reserves have lower \n\nprobability of being recovered than the 2P reserves. If probabilistic methods are used, there \n\nshould be at least a 10% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or \n\nexceed the 3P estimate. \n\nFigure 13: Petroleum classification system \n\n \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         71 \n\n \n\nProved and Probable reserves (2P) are also a category of unproved reserves and \n\ncorrespond to the sum of proved and probable reserves. These reserves are based on \n\ngeological or engineering data similar to those used in the calculation of proved reserves but \n\nalso entail technical, contractual, economic or regulatory uncertainties and therefore are \n\ndisqualified from becoming categorized as proved. When compared with the 1P reserves, \n\nthese have a lower probability of being recovered, but higher if compared with the 3P \n\nreserves. The probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50% probability that \n\nthe quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the 2P estimate. \n\nProved reserves (1P) are those quantities of petroleum which, by analysis of geological and \n\nengineering data can, with reasonable certainty and under current economic conditions \n\n(include relevant petroleum prices and associated costs), operational methods and \n\ngovernment regulations, be estimated to be commercially recoverable, from a certain data \n\nonwards from known reservoirs. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be a  \n\nminimum 90% probability that actual recovered quantities will equal or exceed the \n\nestimatives. \n\nAppendix 6: Galp Energia \u2013  characteristics and strategy by segment \n\nE&amp;P \n\nThe company aspires to develop its current resources in order to increase future oil and gas \n\nproduction. The present goal is to reach to a production of 200 thousands boe/d in 2020 and \n\n300 thousands boe/d in the early 2020's.  \n\nTo achieve this production, Galp is focused on its major E&amp;P assets, located in Angola and \n\nin Brazil?s pre-salt Santos basin where the scale of reserves and the recent discoveries have \n\npositioned it among the restricted group of operators with highly successful exploration \n\nprogrammes. For the company, the participations in the Brazilian exploration fields represent \n\nmore than 90% of the total reserves and contingent resources, from where the company can \n\nextract petroleum and natural gas. Furthermore, after 2012 the focus of the company?s \n\ncapital investments will move from the R&amp;M segment to the development of these projects. \n\nDespite the large assets portfolio as seen in Figure 14, the projects which are the current \n\nsource production of oil and natural gas to Galp are located in Angola?s Block 14 and at \n\nthe Lula field, in the Block BM-S-11, in Brazil, whose production started in October 2010.  \n\nIn the future, Galp?s activities, will be focused on the development and the appraisal of other \n\nestimated resources in the pre-salt of the Santos basin such as blocks BM-S-8, BM-S-11, \n\nBM-S-21 and BM-S-24. The Lula field, included in the Block BM-S-11 has already undergone \n\nthrough an EWT and 8,3 billion recoverable barrels of oil and natural gas were indicated to \n\nexist. \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         72 \n\n \n\n \n\n?

Nevertheless, the company aims to \n\ndevelop a competitive energy generation portfolio with cogeneration plants, wind power and \n\na joint offering of electricity and natural gas, optimizing the margins in this business segment.  \n\nGalp already comprises a cogeneration plant, in Sines, with an installed capacity of 160MW. \n\nMoreover: i) another cogeneration plant in Matosinhos\n57\n\n with a total production capacity of \n\n80MW is under construction; ii) the company partly owns three cogeneration plants - Carri\u00e7o, \n\nPowercer and Energin - with a joint capacity of 80MW; iii) the construction of an alternative \n\npower generation system - a combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plant in Sines \u2013 is being \n\nanalysed until the end of 2011; iv) a wind power project, which has a 200MW installed \n\ncapacity is expected to be in place by 2013; v) Galp anticipates the construction of the 12MW \n\nVale Grande wind farm to be initiated in the fourth quarter of 2010 and completed in 2011. \n\nAppendix 7: Galp Energia \u2013 historical financial performance \n\nFrom 2005 to 2010, the group?s sales &amp; services grew significantly. The only exception in \n\n2009 where there was nearly a 21% reduction in the sales and services RCA\n58\n\n in all \n\nsegments, mainly due to the intensive decline in the oil prices and in the refining margins, a \n\nsmaller volume of natural gas sales and a controversial economic context. \n\n                                                \n\n57\n Expected to come into operations by the end of 2011, it will result in a total increase in consumption of 500 million cubic \n\nmeters of natural gas each year, integrating further the natural gas and power businesses. \n58\n\n Replacement Cost Adjusted -  although not accepted by the IFRS, it adjusts the results in order to smooth the inventory effect \nand exclude non-recurrent events. Within the IFRS accounting method, the cost of goods sold is valued at weighted average \ncost (WAC) what can lead to a volatility in results due to the fact that commodities and good prices fluctuate intensively \u2013 also \ncalled the inventory effect.  By RCA method, the costs of goods is valued at replacement cost, i.e., the average cost of raw \nmaterials in the month when the sales were realized and unrelated to the inventories held at the start or the end of the period.   \n\nFigure 19: Natural gas sold by sector in Portugal and in Spain (Mm3) \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         76 \n\n \n\n0%\n\n10%\n\n20%\n\n30%\n\n40%\n\n50%\n\n60%\n\n70%\n\n80%\n\n90%\n\n100%\n\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 9 months \n\n2011\n\n3,1%\n9,6%\n\n24,2% 20,3% 23,3%\n13,4%\n\n24,6%\n\n58,2%\n51,9%\n\n42,1%\n53,8%\n\n27,5% 44,3%\n14,4%\n\n38,7% 38,8% 34,7%\n25,4%\n\n47,0%\n40,1%\n\n58,6%\n\nHistorical segment contribution to EBIT (RCA) %\n\nE&amp;P R&amp;M G&amp;P Others\n\n2005 2006 ? 06 (%) 2007 ? 07 (%) 2008 ? 08 (%) 2009 ? 09 (%) 2010 ? 10 (%)\n9 months \n\n2011\n\n88% Sales &amp; Services (IFRS)  - Million \u20ac 11.137 12.193 9,6% 12.560 3,0% 15.086 20,1% 12.008 -20,4% 14.064 17,1% 12.429\n\nSales &amp; Services (RCA)   - Million \u20ac 11.137 12.193 9,5% 12.560 3,0% 15.062 19,9% 11.960 -20,6% 13.998 17,0% 12.429\n\nContribution by segment (%)\n\nE&amp;P 0,6% 1,2% 1,9% 1,3% 1,4% 1,5% 1,9%\n\nR&amp;M 90,1% 88,9% 88,5% 87,6% 88,8% 88,5% 87,9%\n\nG&amp;P 10,1% 11,4% 11,6% 12,9% 11,9% 13,1% 12,9%\n\nOthers 0,9% 0,8% 0,8% 0,8% 0,9% 0,9% 0,7%\n\nIn 2010, the company was able to partially recover and sales &amp; services increased by 17%. \n\nThe higher bulk came from the R&amp;M segment following the historical trend but the \n\ncontribution of the G&amp;P and E&amp;P segments to this result grew to 13,1% and 1,5% \n\nrespectively, when compared to the previous year.  \n\nJust in the first 9 months of 2011, the amount of sales was 12.429 million euros what \n\ncorresponded to 88% of the 2010 result.

In 2010, the global energy consumption strongly \n\nrecovered, growing at an above-average rate 5.6% which was the highest rate since 1973, \n\nwith a big contribution of non OECD countries (BP 2011a). \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         79 \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: IEA (2011) \n\nThe biggest pie of the world oil reserves are concentrated in a relatively low amount of \n\ncountries and companies, as seen in Figures 22 and 23Figure 22.

This value has been \n\nincreasing over the last quarters \u2013 in the period 2006 to 2010 it was just 6,7 cents - and in \n\nthe last few months, the oil &amp; gas industry was positioned among the top ten higher earnings \n\nindustries as can be seen in Figure 26.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: (API 2011) \n\n \n\nIndustry trends and challenges: \n\nAccording to Al-Zayer (2007), these are some of the major threats to the sector: \n\nThere are geographic challenges such as the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, the frigid \n\nregions of Russia or the hot, dusty, undeveloped deserts of the Middle East that can affect \n\nthe field?s recovery rate and prodution accomplished. \n\nGlobal geopolitical forces are creating highly volatile markets and unreasonable swings in the \n\ncrude oil price.  \n\nThe sector is currently characterized by a labor shortage, what is reflected in the increasing \n\nwages. In the words of IMF (2011), 50% of the industry?s current skilled workforce will be \n\nretired within the next ten years and the recruitment and training activities of new engineers, \n\ngeologists, technicians and managers activities have been relatively insufficient. \n\nThe firm?s overall costs have been increasing year over year. The expenditures in the drilling \n\nactivities largely contribute to this, in addition to the growing personnel costs. \n\nThe global competition brings out the importance of lowering these operating costs more \n\nthan increasing oil production. \n\nFigure 26: Earnings per dollar of sales \u2013 industry benchmark \u2013 2Q 2011  \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         82 \n\n \n\nThe companies must incessantly seek to develop innovative technologies, in order to \n\nenhance the field?s exploration success rates, reduce the CO2 carbon emissions,  minimize \n\nthe time intervals needed, avoid the wasteful use of energetic resources and improve the fuel \n\nefficiency.  \n\nShareholders are pressuring companies for a rapid return on their investments affecting the \n\nfirm?s reinvestment rithm and their margin to implement large size projects. \n\nThe concern with the environment poses relevant issues and pressures the future path of the \n\ncompanies? strategy. There are projects on the run that aim to: prevent oil spills and reduce \n\ngas flaring, minimize the global warming effect, develop carbon capture and storage (CCS) \n\ntecnhnologies, make use of fossil fuels more environmentally friendly or even promote the \n\nreduction of these fuels consumption. Moreover there is a growing presence of energy and \n\nclimate change legislation that might raise refiners? costs, as well as further limit crude-\n\nderived products demand.  \n\nUncertainties from the demand became an adverse reality since mixed signals are being \n\nsent to the market. If by one side there is an expectation that the supply will need to increase \n\nin order to cover the growth in the world economy, on the other side, many countries are \n\nactively engaged in moving away from fossil fuels.  \n\nSince these facts are directly reflected in the company?s investment decisions, the same \n\nexperts recommend that innovative schemes involving all stakeholders should be \n\nimplemented. Furthermore, to reduce the amount of uncertainty that this produces, \n\ntransparency, dialogue, partnership and a productive cooperation between players should be \n\nefficiently structured in order to minimize losses in times of high and low prices.  \n\nAppendix 9: Dated Brent \u2013 past performance \n\nFigure 27: Dated Brent \u2013 monthly price evolution  (October 2006 to June 2011) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Bloomberg [Accessed on 10 June 2011] \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         83 \n\n \n\n0%\n\n1%\n\n2%\n\n3%\n\n4%\n\n5%\n\n6%\n\n7%\n\n8%\n\nEuro area\n\nWorld\n\nEmerging and Developing \ncountries\n\nLatin America and the \nCaribbean\n\nAppendix 10: Inflation forecast by country groups \n\nData source: IMF [Accessed on 21 December 2011] \n\nAppendix 11: Petroleum energy outlook \n\nAlthough some regions of the world may be cutting back on their energy consumption, the oil \n\nand gas demand will still be largely stimulated as a result of the increase in living standards, \n\nindustrialization and other socio economic factors.  \n\nAccording to OPEC (2010), by 2030, the world energy demand will have increased by more \n\nthan 40% when compared to today?s levels, and the developing countries or rapidly-growing \n\nnon-OECD\n59\n\n economies will be responsible for the most part in this growth, as evidenced in \n\nFigures 29 and 30. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n59\n\n Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development that integrates countries with highly developed economies and \ndemocratic governments. \n\nFigure 28: Inflation projections by country groups \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         84 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: BP (2011)                                                                                          Source: OPEC (2010) \n\nIn what concerns to the global energy consumption, BP (2011) refers that the world primary \n\nenergy consumption which grew 45% in the last 20 years, will grow by 39% over the next 20 \n\nyears (1,7% per year), with a gentle deceleration beyond 2020. \n\nBy 2030, non-OECD energy consumption (in countries like China or Asia) will be 68% higher \n\n(yearly growth of 2,6%) and will account for 93% of the global energy growth. The OECD\n60\n\n \n\neconomies foresee just a 6% growth, and from 2020 on, their energy consumption per capita \n\nwill face a declining trend by over 4 million barrels per day\n61\n\n. \n\nWhile in developing countries, the energy consumption growth will be driven by power \n\ngeneration and industrial activities, in the OECD members the decline will be highly corrected \n\nto the softening growth of consumption by the transportation sector. \n\nConsidering the supply side, in the short term, the growth is likely to come from non-OPEC \n\ncountries, but OPEC will be responsible for an increasing share of global oil supplies in the \n\nlong term (OPEC 2010). \n\nMoreover, among the energy sources globally available \u2013 coal, crude oil, gas and wind for \n\nexample - by 2030, fossil fuels are expected to still make up to 68% until 2030 (from 83% in \n\n1990 to 2010) of the energy mix around the globe (BP 2011). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n60\n\n Their demand has peaked in 2005 according to BP (2011).                                                                            \n61\n\n Which contrasts to what has been happening so far where the industrialized countries led in energy consumption. \n\nFigure 29: OECD and non OECD oil demand Figure 30: Outlook: population, primary energy and GDP \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         85 \n\n \n\nTables 49 and 50: Assumptions \u2013 Capital expenditures (Million \u20ac), 2017 E \u2013 2048 E \n\n(Million \u20ac) 2017 E 2018 E 2019 E 2020 E 2021 E 2022 E 2023 E 2024 E 2025 E 2026 E 2027 E 2028 E 2029 E 2030 E 2031 E 2032 E\n\nTotal Investments 1801 1722 2216 1900 1890 2021 2166 2121 2077 1913 1869 1845 1941 1897 2024 2032\n\n                 Exploration &amp; Production  (E&amp;P) 1507 1423 1911 1590 1575 1700 1840 1790 1740 1570 1520 1490 1580 1530 1510 1510\n\n                 Refining &amp; Marketing  (R&amp;M) 155 158 160 163 166 169 172 174 177 180 183 187 190 193 305 310\n\n                 Gas &amp; Power (G&amp;P) 137 139 141 144 146 148 151 154 156 159 161 164 167 170 203 207\n\n                 Others 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 5 5\n\n(Million \u20ac) 2033 E 2034 E 2035 E 2036 E 2037 E 2038 E 2039 E 2040 E 2041 E 2042 E 2043 E 2044 E 2045 E 2046 E 2047 E 2048 E\n\nTotal Investments 1751 1820 1829 1829 1718 1668 1677 1647 1207 1188 1148 1059 870 881 892 903\n\n                 Exploration &amp; Production  (E&amp;P) 1220 1280 1280 1270 1150 1090 1090 1050 600 570 520 420 220 220 220 220\n\n                 Refining &amp; Marketing  (R&amp;M) 316 321 326 332 337 343 349 355 361 367 373 380 386 393 399 406\n\n                 Gas &amp; Power (G&amp;P) 210 214 218 221 225 229 233 237 241 245 249 253 257 262 266 271\n\n                 Others 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 7\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: BP (2011) \n\nEven so, BP (2011) refers that the fuel mix changes relatively slowly and that gas and non-\n\nfossil fuels will gain share at the expense of coal and oil.

Some examples are: the Bloomberg European 500, the BE500 Energy, the Euronext Top \n\n100 or the WT INTL Energy IIV.  \n\nThe graph presented below points up the stock price evolution. \n\nFigure 32: Galp Energia \u2013 historical stock performance  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Company website \n\nSubsequent to the IPO in 2006, the price per share followed a trend to increase. \n\nFurthermore, in the beginning of 2008, the stock price reached its maximum as Galp entered \n\nthe eletricity business and descovered new amounts of oil in the Pre-Salt Santos Basin.  \n\nThen it went through a bearish period and dropped to a minimum of 6,13\u20ac, which occurred in \n\nOctober 2008. Over the recent years, the price has been reaching higher levels, mainly as \n\nnew progresses in the E&amp;P activities are being announced.  \n\nDuring 2011, the company?s stock was trading at relatively high values, closer to the ones \n\npracticed in the first months of 2008. \n\nAfter the second trimester of 2011, the stock price showed a tendency to decline. \n\nNevertheless, the major fall was when the company announced its partnership with Sinopec \n\nto sell 30% of Petrogal, which was unitl then, totally owned by Galp.  \n\nAdditionally and facing the current portuguese economic climate, regular swings have been \n\ndetected and until now it has been hard for the invertors to invert this situation and offer a \n\nhigher price per share. \n\nEven so, the company has been performing extraordinarily well when compared to the PSI \n\n20 Index or the DJS Oil&amp;Gas Index, or even when compared with companies that are \n\nsimilarly in terms of industry, to Galp, such as, BP or Petrobras, as evidenced next. \n\n\n\nEquity Valuation                                                   GALP ENERGIA S.G.P.S.                                                   2011 \n\nC\u00e1tia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         92 \n\n \n\n?
