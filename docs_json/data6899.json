The Pantanal surveys were carried out in the Nhecol\u00e2ndia, Aquidauana, Miranda, and Paraguai sub-regions; the uplands surveys took place in the Maracaju, Bodoquena, and Urucum formations. Bat specimens were mist-netted over 376 nights in 35 sites, predominantly near fruiting trees, bat shelters, and forest patches. In the floodplain 46 species were recorded (n = 6,292 individuals), and 44 species were found in the uplands (n = 2,745 individuals). Six families were recorded: Phyllostomidae (30 species), Molossidae (12 species), Verpertilionidae (nine species) Noctilionidae (two species), Emballorunidae (two species) and Mormoopidae (one species). The bat fauna was predominantly composed of insectivore (32) and frugivore (15) species. The frugivorous Artibeus planirostris (n = 3,101 individuals) was the commonest species in floodplain and uplands. Other common species were Myotis nigricans (n = 762), Molossus molossus (n = 692), Noctilio albiventris (n = 681), Platyrrhinus lineatus (n = 633), Sturnira lilium (n = 461), Carollia perspicillata (n = 451), Glossophaga soricina (n = 436), Artibeus lituratus (n = 320), and Desmodus rotundus (n = 281). In the floodplain there were three insectivores among the most common species, contrasting with the uplands dominated by the frugivores. The diversity for the 35 sites assembled (H\u2019 = 2.5) is comparable to that recorded for tropical forests. The bat fauna presented here represents 34% of the Brazilian bat species, and 62% of species reported for the Upper Paraguay River Basin. Additionally, five species are reported for the first time in Mato Grosso do Sul.\nKeywords: bats, biodiversity, Chiroptera, habitats, Pantanal.\nRiqueza de esp\u00e9cies de morcegos no Pantanal e no planalto em seu entorno\nResumo\nEstudamos a fauna de morcegos na plan\u00edcie do Pantanal e nos planaltos de entorno no Mato Grosso do Sul, Brasil, com base na cole\u00e7\u00e3o cient\u00edfica da Universidade Anhanguera - Uniderp e no banco de dados do Projeto Morcegos do Pantanal, UFMS, incluindo 9.037 capturas de 56 esp\u00e9cies, entre 1994 e 2007. Amostragens no Pantanal foram feitas nas sub-regi\u00f5es da Nhecol\u00e2ndia, Aquidauana, Miranda e Paraguai; no planalto as amostragens foram realizadas nas forma\u00e7\u00f5es de Maracaju, Bodoquena e Urucum. Esp\u00e9cies de morcegos foram registradas ao longo de 376 noites em 35 s\u00edtios, predominantemente com o uso de redes de neblina pr\u00f3ximas a \u00e1rvores frut\u00edferas, abrigos e florestas. Na plan\u00edcie, foram registradas 46 esp\u00e9cies (n = 6.292 indiv\u00edduos) e no planalto 44 esp\u00e9cies (n = 2.745 indiv\u00edduos). Seis fam\u00edlias foram encontradas: Phyllostomidae (30 esp\u00e9cies), Molossidae (12 esp\u00e9cies), Verpertilionidae (nove esp\u00e9cies), Noctilionidae (duas esp\u00e9cies), Emballorunidae (duas esp\u00e9cies) e Mormoopidae (uma esp\u00e9cie). A fauna de morcegos foi predominantemente composta de esp\u00e9cies inset\u00edvoras (32) e frug\u00edvoras (15). O frug\u00edvoro Artibeus planirostris (n = 3.101) foi a esp\u00e9cie mais comum na plan\u00edcie e no planalto.

Introduction\nBats are often the most species-rich mammalian taxonomic group in the tropics (Patterson et al., 2001) and represent nearly one-third of Brazilian land fauna (Marinho-Filho and Sazima, 1998). Different studies have shown latitudinal gradients contributing to the understanding of geographic distribution of bat diversity, by analysis of species richness patterns on a large scale, across wide spatial areas or with regional focus (Rohde, 1992; Willig, 2000; Stevens and Willig, 2002). Another approach is to examine changes in species richness along environmental gradients, when an assemblage of interacting bat species utilizes the same resource, for example seasonal productivity, which is carried out on smaller spatial scales (Alho, 2008; Drobner et al., 1998; Wilsey and Potvin, 2000). Some environmental factors limit the occurrence and abundance of some species, including habitat heterogeneity, seasonality and conservation status (Alho, 2005; Keddy et al., 2009).\nBat communities exhibit a variety of functional groups (guilds) such as insectivores, frugivores, nectarivores, sanguivores and piscivores (Stevens and Willig, 2002). Some studies have shown these bat assemblages in different areas: trophic relations in the Phyllostomidae from Panga Reserve, southeastern Brazil (Pedro and Taddei, 1997); bat community structure in a south-east Brazilian reserve in a transition zone between Cerrado and Atlantic Forest (Falc\u00e3o et al., 2003); diversity of a Cerrado habitat in central Brazil (Zort\u00e9a and Alho, 2008). Recent literature has synthesised the number of species and distribution in Brazil (Reis et al., 2007), as well as a bat community in a savanna habitat in Bolivia, near the Pantanal (Willig et al., 2000; Aguirre, 2002). Available data on bats of the Pantanal floodplain and its neighbouring uplands, particularly from Mato Grosso do Sul state, are reported in Leite et al. (1998, 2000), Taddei et al. (2000, 2001, 2003), Camargo and Fischer (2005), Gon\u00e7alves et al. (2007), Longo et al. (2007), Camargo et al. (2009), Cunha et al. (2009), and Teixeira et al. (2009).\nLarge and environmentally heterogeneous wetlands like the Pantanal (147,574 km2 - latitude 15\u00b0 30'-22\u00b0 30' S and longitude 54\u00b0 45'-58\u00b0 30' W), exhibiting annual changes in evenness along environmental gradients, play an important role in biological diversity, because of the heterogeneity of natural habitats, offering opportunities for feeding and reproductive niches (Alho, 2008; Keddy et al., 2009). Differences in bat species abundance may respond to local environmental annual changes or to degree of habitat degradation. Because the Pantanal and its surrounding habitats harbour a large number of bat species, some common (high abundance) and some relatively rare, intensive survey efforts are needed to estimate confidently the species abundance distributions.\nThe aim of this study is to show the magnitude of the bat species richness and the structure of the community, evaluating relative abundance and trophic distribution within the Pantanal floodplain and throughout its surrounding\nCerrado plateaus, as well as to discuss the present status of natural habitat conservation and their bat-associated species.\n2.\tMethods\n2.1.\tStudy sites\n2.1.1.\tPantanal flood plain and surrounding uplands\nThe maze of fluctuating water levels, nutrients, and biota in the Pantanal forms a dynamic ecosystem (Alho,\n2008)\t. The degree of inundation creates a range of major habitats. Flooding occupies about 80% of the whole Pantanal. In contrast, during the dry season, most of the flooded areas stay dry, when the water returns to the river beds or evaporates. Major habitats include patches (~ 0.5-5 ha) of semi-deciduous forests (cap\u00f5es) surrounded by grasslands, belts of cerrad\u00e3o or semi-deciduous forests surrounding lagoons (cordilheiras), riparian semi-deciduous forests, and mono-specific forests of woody species such as Tabebuia aurea (paratudal) and Vochysia divergens (cambarazal) (Silva et al., 2000; Ara\u00fajo and Sazima, 2003). The upper ground (where there are cap\u00f5es and cordilheiras) is at most only a couple of metres above average water level. Rivers and depressions locally known as corixos are lined by riparian forests. In these forest habitats, different species of Ficus and other trees serve as food supply and shelter for frugivores (Teixeira et al.,\n2009)\t. The uplands surrounding the Pantanal are covered by senso strictu cerrado, cerrad\u00e3o and semi-deciduous forests, which are severely threatened by agriculture and cattle ranching (Alho, 2008; Scariot et al., 2005). Bats were sampled in 35 sites in the Pantanal floodplain and its bordering plateaus, as described below.\n2.1.2.\tPantanal sampling sites\nField work was carried out in 19 sites (Figure 1) in different Pantanal sub-regions and municipalities (see Silva and Abdon, 1998). In the Pantanal sub-region of Pantanal da Nhecol\u00e2ndia eight sites were sampled: Fazenda Nhumirim (18\u00b0 59' 6.93\u201d S and 56\u00b0 37' 24.37\u201d W), Fazenda Arara Azul (19\u00b0 23' 41.37\u201d S and 57\u00b0 1' 43.11\u201d W), Fazenda Guanabara (18\u00b0 14' 6.5\u201d S and 55\u00b0 45' 0.9\u201d W), Fazenda Campo Neta (18\u00b0 45\u2019 38.8\u201d S and 56\u00b0 17\u2019 48.3\u201d W), Fazenda Santa Terezinha (19\u00b0 22' 38.5\u201d S and 56\u00b0 3' 20.5\u201d W), Fazenda Ba\u00eda das Pedras (19\u00b0 18\u2019 9.78\u201d S and 55\u00b0 47\u2019 0.44\u201d W), Fazenda Mangabal (19\u00b0 2' 27.91\u201d S and 55\u00b0 49' 43.97\u201d W), and Fazenda Barra Mansa (19\u00b0 36' 0.94\u201d S and 56\u00b0 4' 36.31\u201d W). In the sub-region of Pantanal de Aquidauana seven sites were sampled: Fazenda Conquista (19\u00b0 18' 15.54\u201d S and 55\u00b0 14' 40.38\u201d W), Fazenda Santa Maria (19\u00b0 19' 47.48\u201d S and 55\u00b0 22' 50.62\u201d W), Fazenda Olhos D\u2019\u00e1gua (19\u00b0 26\u2019 0.52\u201d S and 55\u00b0 12\u2019 8.71\u201d W), Fazenda Santa Emilia (19\u00b0 30\u2019 23.24\u201d S and 55\u00b0 36\u2019 46.10\u201d W), Est\u00e2ncia Caiman (19\u00b0 57' 56'' S and 56\u00b0 18' 37\u2019\u2019 W), Fazenda Guaicurus (20\u00b0 4' 49.96\u201d S and 56\u00b0 28' 55.05\u201d W), and Fazenda Santana (19\u00b0 37' 51'' S and 55\u00b0 40' 36'' W).

In the sub-region of Pantanal do Paraguai there was one site: Fazenda Corumb\u00e1 (19\u00b0 0\u2019 35.36\u201d S and 57\u00b0 39\u2019 17.08\u201d W).\n2.1.3.\tUpland plateau sampling sites\nSamplings comprised 16 sites in the plateau (Figure 1). In the Maracaju uplands there were six sites: Fazenda Furnas D\u2019\u00e1gua (20\u00b0 9\u2019 29.38\u201d S and 55\u00b0 24\u2019 16.02\u201d W), Distrito de Camis\u00e3o (20\u00b0 17\u2019 11.28\u201d S and 55\u00b0 23\u2019 2.07\u201d W), Distrito de Piraputanga (20\u00b0 16\u2019 38.03\u201d S and 55\u00b0 18\u2019 18.54\u201d W), Fazenda Vista Alegre (20\u00b0 5\u2019 55.13\u201d S and 54\u00b0 27\u2019 26.67\u201d W), Munic\u00edpio de Campo Grande (20\u00b0 27\u2019 4.58\u201d S and 54\u00b0 36\u2019 57.38\u201d W), Fazenda Taboco (20\u00b0 3\u2019 36\u201d S and 55\u00b0 36\u2019 20\u201d W). In the Bodoquena uplands there were nine sites: Fazenda Campina Grande (20\u00b0 21\u2019 22.32\u201d\nS and 56\u00b0 22\u2019 25.90\u201d W), Fazenda Dona Benedita (20\u00b0 20\u2019 44.78\u201d S and 56\u00b0 26\u2019 13.12\u201d W), Fazenda S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o (20\u00b0 20\u2019 16.93\u201d S and 56\u00b0 22\u2019 55.48\u201d W), Fazenda S\u00e3o Vicente (20\u00b0 31\u2019 25.37\u201d S and 56\u00b0 24\u2019 56.63\u201d W), Fazenda Santa Tereza (21\u00b0 5\u2019 14.27\u201d S and 56\u00b0 3\u2019 10.63\u201d W), Fazenda Campo Verde (21\u00b0 24\u2019 48.23\u2019\u2019 S and 56\u00b0 46\u2019 32.12\u2019\u2019 W), Fazenda Harmonia (21\u00b0 7\u2019 39.31\u201d S and 56\u00b0 45\u2019 42.04\u201d W), Fazenda Rancho Branco (20\u00b0 41\u2019 17.62\u201d S and 56\u00b0 46\u2019 42.40\u201d W), Bonito (21\u00b0 7\u2019 38.46\u201d S and 56\u00b0 29\u2019 13.68\u201d W). In the Maci\u00e7o do Urucum uplands there was one site (19\u00b0 18\u2019 52.42\u201d S and 57\u00b0 36\u2019 12.19\u201d W).\n2.2. Samplings and analyses\nThis study relies on the bat scientific collection organised by Dr. Valdir Ant\u00f4nio Taddei at Universidade Anhanguera - Uniderp, Campo Grande, MS, between 1994 and 2006, with 4,239 bat specimens collected through\ndifferent procedures, predominantly straightforward mist-net surveys, and on the Projeto Morcegos do Pantanal databank at UFMS, Campo Grande, MS, with 4,798 bat entries through mist-net captures between 1998 and 2007. Surveys covered different hydrological seasons of the Pantanal and its surroundings in different habitats, near fruiting trees, bat shelters, or forest canopies. Total capture effort was about 290,000 h.m2 (time in which nets were kept open multiplied by the area of the nets), distributed throughout 376 nights, with four to 12 nets of variable sizes open per night. Biometrical data were obtained and voucher specimens were prepared for identification, which followed the criteria established by Vizotto and Taddei (1973), Taddei (1983), Anderson (1997), Lopez-Gonzalez et al. (2001), Gregorin and Taddei (2002), Vicente et al. (2005), and Reis et al. (2006, 2007).\n3.\tResults and Discussion\n3.1. Bat fauna in south Pantanal and surrounding uplands\nIn all 35 sites 9,037 individuals belonging to 56 species, 36 genera and six families were recorded (Table 1). This number of species represents 34% of the whole richness of bats in Brazil, including the Amazon, annotated by Reis et al. (2006, 2007); it reaches 62% of the total richness reported for the entire Upper Paraguay River Basin (n = 90 bat species), including the northern area in Mato Grosso, Brazil, and the Bolivian and Paraguayan areas (Tomas et al., 2009). In the floodplain sites, 6,292 individuals of 46 species were captured, a number which reaches 64% of the bat species already registered in the whole Pantanal floodplain (Tomas et al., 2009; Alho et al., 2003); in the upland sites surrounding the Pantanal 2,745 individuals of 44 species were recorded, representing 65% of the bat species already reported to occur along the entire Pantanal borders (Tomas et al., 2009). The large number of captures and the cumulative curve of species captured (Figure 2), throughout a relatively long period of time dedicated to survey (1994-2007), indicate that overall species richness was well sampled and that this is a reliable representation of bat diversity in the focal region. In addition, five species found here - Diphylla ecaudata, Mimon bennettii, Trachops cirrhosus, Uroderma magnirostrum, and Molossus pretiosus - were still not reported for Mato Grosso do Sul (Caceres et al., 2008), increasing to 66 the number of bat species registered in this state.\nThe richest and most abundant families in our 35 study sites were Phyllostomidae (30 species and 6,228 individuals) and Molossidae (12 species and 1,071 individuals) (Table 1), corresponding to 34% and 46% of the Brazilian species in these two families respectively (Gregorin and Taddei, 2002; Reis et al., 2006, 2007). Richness of molossid bats (all insectivorous) in the floodplain (n = 11) was almost twice that in the upland plateaus (n = 6), largely contributing to the high number of insectivorous species exclusively found in the floodplain rather than in plateaus (Figure 3).\nOtherwise, the number of phyllostomid species in plateaus (n = 27) was slightly higher than in the floodplain (n = 23), contributing to the increased number of exclusively frugivorous species in the plateaus (Figure 3). Although phyllostomids were richer in plateaus, the subfamily Phyllostominae presented more species in the floodplain; and it included all the insectivorous bats among phyllostomid species. Therefore, insectivory appears to be a trait which favours the occurrence of bat species in the floodplain. Indeed, even the frugivorous phyllostomids feed on insects proportionally more in the Pantanal floodplain than in its bordering plateaus or elsewhere (Munin, 2008; Teixeira et al., 2009). Diets toward insectivory might be partially explained because insects are available throughout the year, and massively during several months, whereas bat fruit sources are markedly seasonal and poor in the Pantanal floodplain (Munin, 2008; Teixeira et al., 2009).\nArtibeus planirostris (n = 3,101 individuals) was by far the most dominant bat species throughout the entire focal region (Figure 4), showing one order of magnitude more captures than the next nine highly common species - Myotis nigricans (n = 762), Molossus molossus (n = 692), Noctilio albiventris (n = 681), Platyrrhinus lineatus (n = 633), Sturnira lilium (n = 461), Carolliaperspicillata (n = 451), Glossophaga soricina (n = 436), Artibeus lituratus (n = 320), and Desmodus rotundus (n = 281). Such strong dominance of A. planirostris has been also reported in other local surveys in the Pantanal floodplain and in its neighbouring upland regions (Camargo, 2003; Camargo et al., 2009; Cunha et al., 2009; Teixeira et al., 2009). Although the dominance by A. planirostris occurred in both regions, in the Pantanal floodplain there were three insectivorous non-phyllostomid species (Myotis nigricans, Noctilio albiventris, and Molossus molossus) among the most common bats, contrasting with the upland plateaus where the commonest species were all frugivorous phyllostomids (Figure 4). The frugivorous C. perspicillata was the second most abundant species in the uplands, but it was not one of the top ten species in the floodplain (Figure 4). Thus, the relative abundance of insectivorous bats appears to be higher in the floodplain than in the uplands, probably for the same reasons which explain the exceptionally high richness of insectivores as discussed above. Calculated values for the Shannon index of diversity were similar between the Pantanal floodplain (H\u2019 = 2.3) and its neighbouring uplands (H\u2019 = 2.5). Assembling all the 35 sampling sites, diversity was found to be H = 2.5. These values are higher than those (H\u2019 = 1.5 to 1.8) found in short-term surveys in the Bodoquena region (Camargo et al., 2009; Cunha et al., 2009), and closer to values (H\u2019 = 1.8 to 2.3) found for different areas in the Atlantic forest in southeastern Brazil (Pedro and Taddei, 1997; Esb\u00e9rard, 2003).\nIn pockets of cerrado habitats the most abundant species are Artibeus planirostris (n = 431), Noctilio albiventris (n = 381) and Molossus molossus (n = 362). In fragments of semi-deciduous and deciduous forest on plateaus on the outskirts of the Pantanal the common species are: Myotis nigricans (n = 489), Noctilio albiventris (n = 168)\nTable 1.

Some authors (Bergallo et al., 2000) consider this species as threatened by extinction, but it is not listed in the \u201cLivro Vermelho da Fauna Brasileira Amea\u00e7ada de Extin\u00e7\u00e3o [The Red Book of Brazilian Fauna under Threat of Extinction]\u201d, published by the Ministry for the Environment (Minist\u00e9rio do Meio Ambiente) in 2008. No species found in our survey for the Pantanal is officially listed as threatened. Chrotopterus auritus is a large carnivore/insectivore, preying on small mammals, birds and insects, which is very sensitive to environmental disturbance, requiring good forest habitats and shelter in caves. Artibeus lituratus was recorded at only 1.5% in our study, but it is a good coloniser of disturbed habitat, besides living in low densities. The survey conducted in the region of Apor\u00e9-Sucuri\u00fa, northern Mato Grosso do Sul, revealed\nthat the most caught family was Phyllostomidae, represented by Glossophaga soricina and Artibeus lituratus; and some rare species such as Lophostoma brasiliense, Lonchophylla mordax and Lionycteris spurrelli (Bordignon, 2006).\nTo analyse possible grouping of species or assemblages in the three major habitats, we performed a non-metric multi-dimensional scaling analysis taking the frequencies of species distribution, and found that the grouping composed of Myotis albescens, Molossops temminckii, Sturnira lilium, Phyllostomus hastatus, Desmodus rotundus, Glossophaga soricina, Carollia perspicillata, Platyrrhinus lineatus, Molossus molossus, Artibeus planirostris and Noctilio albiventris occurs in the three major habitats: cerrado, semi-deciduous forest and disturbed habitats (with 82% of similarity).\nFigure 5. Distribution of the bat species in three major habitats in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. SAV: savanna or Cerrado; AA: disturbed areas near ranches and other human occupation; and ATE: the ecotone zone between the floodplain and the upland \u201cplanalto\u201d, covered by semi-deciduous forest.\n3.2. Bat species as bio-indicator\nThe Pantanal is undoubtedly an important domain and therefore deserves comprehensive ecosystem studies. Our present information on bat species richness and assemblages, considering such abundant sampling data, contributes to making a more general interpretation of species magnitude for conservation purposes. Bat species, for example, can serve as indicators for habitat quality. Natural habitats of the Pantanal have been disrupted by non-sustainable practices of socio-economic development, mainly by conversion of natural vegetation to pastures for cattle ranching and agriculture (Alho, 2008). Farms have been established in the floodplain and in its surrounding uplands, where much of the natural vegetation has been converted to soybean plantations or to other human activities. Studies concluded that 17% of the Pantanal has been deforested through the use of fire (mainly cerrado patches or \u201c\u2018cap\u00f5es de cerrado\u201d), with an annual rate of deforestation of 2.3%; and 63% of the natural vegetation cover of the surrounding plateaus in the Planalto (savanna woodland and semi-deciduous forests) has been destroyed (Harris et al., 2005). Deforestation between1976 and 2008 in the Pantanal floodplain increased 26.5 times (12.14%), compared to 40.97% of deforestation within the Upper Paraguay basin (Silva et al., 2010).\nIn pastures continuously used for cattle ranching, the dominance of A. planirostris in the bat assemblages is higher than in areas used intermittently by cattle (C. Santos, unpublished data), indicating that cattle ranching may cause a reduction in bat diversity. In addition, fire events seem to promote changes in bat species composition. Artibeus planirostris has been found to be the most abundant bat in both burned and unburned sites in the floodplain; however, after fire, the insectivorous phyllostomine bats increase\nin abundance, whereas the abundance of frugivorous stenodermatines and nectarivorous glossophagines decreases (C. Santos, unpublished data).\nOur data show a high number of Phyllostomidae, which may represent a good indicator for low levels of habitat disturbance (Pedro at al., 1995; Pedro, 1998; Medellin et al., 2000). This family is well diversified in number of species and in feeding habits. The high number of frugivore species in the family implies that the habitats support a high number of fruit-bearing trees (see Pott and Pott, 1994). In addition, the high primary production favours an increased abundance of arthropods, which supports the guild of insectivore bats. The abundance of frugivore species reflects the importance of this guild for the Pantanal bat assemblages. In addition, bats play an important role in regulating the Pantanal ecosystem as seed dispersers, pollinators and regulators of insect populations (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2007; Munin, 2008; Teixeira et al., 2009). Given that some bat species or bat assemblages require pristine habitat conditions while others are opportunistic, taking advantage of some disturbance, the group should be more studied as an indicator of levels of change in the natural environment. Drastic human alteration in natural habitats may result in simplifying bat diversity and assemblage, since those species which require more specific items in feeding strategy tend to disappear, while those with a wide spectrum of feeding habits, such as insectivore-omnivore and frugivore-omnivore, are generally less affected by environmental changes.\nEffects of forest fragmentation on frugivore and nectarivore species have been pointed out in French Guiana (Cossons, 1999). The role of frugivorous bats has been emphasised in tropical forest succession (Muscarella and Flemming, 2007). Overall, Phyllostomid bats have been identified as indicators of habitat disruption in the Neotropics (Fenton et al., 1992). Work conducted in forest habitats of Paraguay has shown that abundance was highest for Artibeus lituratus in deforested landscapes and for Chrotopterus auritus in forested habitats; in contrast, Artibeus fimbriatus, Carollia perspicillata, Glossophaga soricina, Platyrrhinus lineatus, Pygoderma bilabiatum, and Sturnira lilium attained highest abundance in moderately fragmented forest landscapes. Forest cover, patch size, and patch density frequently were associated with abundance of species (Gorresen and Willig, 2004).\nTherefore, our data indicate that bat species richness and assemblages in the Pantanal and its surrounding habitats are still well preserved, and it is hoped that these findings may be useful for constructive lines of biodiversity conservation and management in this important wetland ecosystem.\nAcknowledgements - This study was partially supported by the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento do Ensino, Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia do Estado de Mato Grosso do Sul (FUNDECT) grants to Dr. Cleber Alho (Termo de Outorga n.\u00b0 0133/06), to E.
