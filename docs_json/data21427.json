Os efeitos\nhidrodina?micos de um navio em a?guas rasas sa?o muito diferentes, comparados a esses\nefeitos em a?guas com profundidade infinita.\n\nA ana?lise hidrodina?mica e? realizada numericamente usando a Dina?mica dos Fluidos\nComputacional (CFD, acro?nimo em ingle?s). A soluc?a?o das equac?o?es de Navier-Stokes\n(NS) junto com a decomposic?a?o do Reynolds (RANS, acro?nimo em ingle?s) e? aplicada\npara simular os efeitos viscosos e de pressa?o em torno de um tanque e de uma embarcac?a?o\nem um tanque confinado que e? caracterizado pelos efeitos do fundo e das paredes. Para\nefeitos de turbule?ncia, o modelo realizado k-? e? usado. O movimento da embarcac?a?o do\nrio provoca elevac?o?es da superf??cie livre que sa?o capturadas usando o me?todo do Volume\nde Fluido (VOF, acro?nimo em ingle?s). Para a discretizac?a?o do dom??nio de fluxo, o Me?todo\ndos Volumes Finitos (FVM, acro?nimo em ingle?s) e? utilizado. O movimento dos fluidos e?\natualizado para cada intervalo de tempo o que permite o ca?lculo da resiste?ncia atuando\nno casco.\n\nOs resultados da simulac?a?o nume?rica sa?o comparados com dados experimentais obti-\ndos pelo Instituto de Pesquisas Tecnolo?gicas do Estado de Sa?o Paulo (IPT), juntamente\ncom os me?todos emp??ricos existentes para esse tipo de casos.\n\nPalavras-Chave: A?guas rasas, Barcac?a, CFD, FVM, Modelo de turbule?ncia k-?, Re-\nsistencia, RANS, Rio Magdalena, VOF.\n\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe subject of this study is the determination of the resistance of an inland vessel\nengaged in cargo transport in the lower course of the Magdalena River, considering that\nthe hydrodynamic effects in shallow water navigation are very different compared to the\neffects in deep water navigation.\n\nThe hydrodynamic analysis is realized numerically using Computational Fluid Dy-\nnamics (CFD). The Reynolds-Averaging Navier-Stokes equation (RANS) solver is applied\nto simulate viscous and pressure effects around a tank and a hull in confined tank consid-\nering the wall bottom and side effects in shallow water navigation. For turbulence effects,\nrealizable k-? model is used. The motion of the vessel causes elevations of the free surface,\nin which, is captured using the Volume of Fluid method (VOF). For discretization of flow\ndomain, the Finite Volume Method (FVM) is applied. The motion of the fluids is updated\nfor each time step that allows the calculation of the resistance acting on the hull.\n\nThe numerical simulation results are compared with experimental data obtained by\nthe Technological Research Institute of the State of Sa?o Paulo (IPT, acronym in Por-\ntuguese) together with the existing empirical methods for this type of cases.\n\nKeywords: CFD, Free surface flow, FVM, Inland vessel, k-?

The Magdalena river was discovered and named by Rodrigo de\n\nBastidas at the beginning of 16th century (specifically on April 1st in 1501) and gained\n\ngreat importance as a main access route. During the colonization period, the river served\n\nas a single route between Santa Fe? de Bogota? (actually Bogota?) and the port of Cartagena\n\n(Bernal Duffo, 2013).\n\nDuring the independence period, the patriotic armies used the river to dominate the\n\nSpanish colony. Gabriel Garcia Marquez described these events in his historical novel The\n\nGeneral in His Labyrinth.\n\nAs far as the logistics are concerned, the fluvial transport was used from the colonial\n\nperiod until the middle of 19th century for the transport of commercial products which\n\nwere transported in keel-boats. In 1822, steamboats were introduced, and the harvest of\n\ntobacco in 1850s made the river transport more profitable. Nevertheless in 20th century,\n\nthe commercial activities of the river for the transport of commercial goods started to\n\ndecline due to the air services, the railway transport and mainly, the road transportation\n\n(Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 2015d).\n\nWith the aim of increasing the activities of the river, the Colombian Constitution of\n\n1991 created the Magdalena Grand River Corporation (Cormagdalena, acronym in Span-\n\nish) and since then, the fluvial transport has been recovering due to projects developed\n\nor being developed that imply the navigability of the river that includes, the construction\n\nof ports, dredging works and the maintenance of the river. Nowadays, the cargoes are\n\ntransported in convoys, each of which consists of a tugboat and a maximum of six barges\n\n\n\n2\n\norganized in series and/or in parallel.\n\nIn 2017, 3.67 million tons of a large variety of goods, including hydrocarbons and dry\n\ncargoes such as coal and cement, were mobilized by the river. This signify an increase of\n\n68.5% compared to the numbers of the previous year (Ministry of Transport - Colombia,\n\n2018).\n\nThere are different types of inland vessel (Bureau Voorlichting Binnenvaart, n.d.):\n\ndry-cargo carriers, well barges, tank vessels, push/tugboats and ro-ro.\n\nThe Magdalena River is the most important in the country with an extension of\n\n1,497 km and its birthplace is located in the Pa?ramo de las Papas (placed in the Andes\n\nmountain range). This river is divided in three courses: upper, middle and lower (Figure\n\n1.1), crossing 128 municipalities and 11 departments. The river receives the affluents of\n\nthe San Jorge, Cesar and Cauca rivers, increasing its flow. Finally, the river mouths in the\n\nCaribbean Sea and close to Barranquilla city (ACOSTA-LOPERA; CABRERA-TOVAR,\n\n2014; Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 2015d). The area under the influence of the Magdalena\n\nriver is responsible for 80% of GDP of the country, 70% of the hydraulic energy, 95% of\n\nthe thermoelectricity, 70% of agricultural production, 50% of freshwater fishing (Castro\n\nPinzo?n, 2017).\n\nCompared to other countries, the Netherlands is a pioneer in this type of transport,\n\nsince its canal system is based on large natural rivers. For example, to transport a cargo\n\nof 16,000 tons, 660 trucks are needed for road transport, while only one inland barge\n\ncan transport the total of that cargo and the Dutch operators take advantage of these\n\nnumbers as the riverboats under the Dutch flag that is represented around 50% of the\n\nentire Western European fleet. Furthermore, the importance of the rivers in Netherlands is\n\nobvious as 6,000 km of a total of 24,709 km of the European waterways are Dutch, where\n\n500 km are main routes (Bureau Voorlichting Binnenvaart, 2011; ACOSTA-LOPERA;\n\nCABRERA-TOVAR, 2014; Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 2015a).\n\nThe fluid mechanics allow the study of the fluids at rest (stationary ) and, mainly,\n\nin motion (dynamic). The last term is called Fluid Dynamics. The fundamental mathe-\n\nmatical equations describe the physical characteristics of the fluid motion. The solution\n\nof the math equations is converted in a high-level computer programming language into\n\ncomputer programs applying numerical methods and is called computer science. These\n\ndisciplines integrate the branch of the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), illustrated\n\nin the Figure 1.2 (TU; YEOH; LIU, 2008).\n\nThe numerical methods imply the comparison and the validation of the experimen-\n\n\n\n3\n\nMagdalena river\n\nUpper course\n\nMiddle course\n\nLower course\n\nFigure 1.1: Hydrography of the Magdalena River, divided in upper (blue), middle (yellow)\nand lower (pink) courses.

In the Table 1.1, extracted\n\nfrom Pletcher, Tannehill and Anderson (2013), the strategies to solve problems of fluid\n\nmechanics are compared. Over the years, the speed of computer processing has been in-\n\ncreasing contrary to computational costs, illustrated in the Figure 1.4.

When the Navier-Stokes equations are used\n\nnumerically, the turbulent behavior is not represented directly, therefore the need for\n\nthe adoption of turbulent models from the original equations. However, there are exist\n\nturbulence models that allow resolve this type of flows.\n\n1.1 Presentation of the problem\n\nThe need to improve efficiency of cargo transport sector had motivated the increase\n\nin the number of self-propelled vessels in the main river of the country, allowing the direct\n\naccess of companies located inland to the main ports of the Colombian northern regions.\n\nDespite the economic advantages of cargo transport by river for the national econ-\n\n\n\n5\n\nFigure 1.4: Evolution of computer performance from the 1950s. Source: Hirsch (2007).\n\nomy, resulted from the reduction of freight rates and costs of exportation, the road trans-\n\nportation remains the main transport system in Colombia where factors, such as poor\n\nconservation and the weather conditions makes this transport mode very expensive and\n\ninefficient.\n\nThe elaboration of inland vessel projects ends up being a local regional or national\n\nproblem since it depends on the conditions in the waterway, the route and the market\n\nin which the vessel will operate, as well as, other factors such as mission, cargo capacity\n\nand autonomy. The physical characteristics of the river and the aspects of the shallow\n\nwater effects (as draft and beam restrictions, crossing ships in restricted spaces, radius\n\nof curvature of the river, locks) are important for the execution of the project. In this\n\nproject, the type of inland vessel will be designed for dry-cargo carrier, well barge and\n\ntank vessel.\n\n\n\n6\n\n1.2 Objectives\n\nThe objective of this work is the study of the resistance of a 2700 TDW inland vessel\n\nself-propelled by CFD numerical simulation and the validation and comparison of the\n\nnumerical results with the existing empirical formulas and the experimental test results.\n\nThe following specific objectives are proposed during development of this objective:\n\n? Understanding of the phenomena involving fluid flow along the inland vessel hull in\n\nshallow waters;\n\n? Modeling of the 2700 TDW inland vessel hull using the CAD software FREE!Ship\n\nand Rhinoceros ;\n\n? Evaluation of the hull resistance using empirical formulas;\n\n? Numerical simulation of the 2700 TDW inland vessel hull using CFD software STAR-\n\nCCM+.\n\n? Application of the grid convergence criteria for the choosing the number of elements\n\nthat it will simulate the resistance and calculation of the properties of the inland\n\nvessel.\n\nThe study is divided in 6 chapters:\n\n? Chapter 1 is the introduction of this study, where the presentation of the problem\n\nand the objectives are presented.\n\n? Chapter 2 presents the state of art, including important references.\n\n? Chapter 3 explains the empirical method for the estimation of the inland vessel\n\nresistance. For this purpose, the empirical formulations for the velocity loss cal-\n\nculation of the vessel in shallow water using Schlichting, Landweber, Lackenby for\n\nlarge rivers, as well as, the empirical formulations for middle rivers, where the ef-\n\nfective velocities calculation applying the Karpov\u2019s diagrams and the correction of\n\nwall effect by Artjushkov are used.\n\n? The resistance estimation applying CFD is the main topic of the chapters 4 and 5,\n\nwhere the equations for the numerical calculation, the procedure and the method-\n\nology, applied to inland vessels, are explained. Finally, the numerical results are\n\ncompared to the experimental results for validation purposes.\n\n\n\n7\n\n? Chapter 6 presents the conclusions and the future work of the project. The next\n\nchapter, the references consulted are listed. The appendices present the calculations\n\nconcerning the shallow water effects and others results, including the experimental\n\nresults, and codes used in this study.\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n9\n\n2 BIBLIOGRAPHIC REVIEW\n\nThe calculation of the resistance is based on Froude Hypothesis that is composed\n\nby frictional and residual resistances, where are expressed by the frictional and residual\n\ncoefficients, wetted surface of the hull, velocity of the vessel and water density. ITTC\n\n(1957) established an equation for the frictional resistance coefficient. Guldhammer and\n\nHarvald (1974) created diagrams for the calculation of the residuary resistance coeffi-\n\ncient. Georgakaki and Sorenson (2004) demonstrated that the resistance coefficient can\n\nbe extrapolated providing reasonable results.\n\nConsidering the effects of shallow waters, Molland, Turnock and Hudson (2011) ex-\n\nplained the wave generating phenomena for the resistance calculation. Latorre, Luthra\n\nand Tang (1982) presented the empirical methods of study for inland vessels applied to\n\nEuropean and American vessels. ITTC (1987) considered some typical parameters to esti-\n\nmate the waterway restriction in shallow water. Pompe?e (2015) reviewed many empirical\n\nmethods to determine the resistance of the ship depending on the type of vessel (pushed\n\nconvoy or self-propelled), as well as, the physical conditions of a river (small, medium and\n\nlarge). In this study is explained only empirical formulations for medium and large rivers.\n\nFor large rivers and sea access channels, Schlichting (1934) presented the analysis of\n\nshallow water effects through experimental test and theoretical considerations, without\n\ninfluence of walls in a towing tank. Landweber (1939) improved this work, proposing the\n\nhydraulic radius. Lackenby (1963) simplified the semi-empirical formula of the velocity\n\nloss proposed by Schlichting.\n\nIn case of medium rivers, the effects of the shallow water are different. Karpov (1946)\n\ninterpreters these phenomena with effective velocities for frictional and residual resis-\n\ntances that can be determined through two diagrams proposed by him. Artjushkov (1968)\n\nimproved this work correcting the wall effects. Georgakaki and Sorenson (2004) demon-\n\nstrated that these diagrams and the correction of the wall effects would be extrapolated,\n\nand they proposed equations for the approximation of these parameters.\n\n\n\n10\n\nFor small rivers, the calculation of the inland vessel resistance is associated with the\n\nexistence of a limited velocity in restricted waterways that cannot exceed, where could\n\nbe caused by a steep ship resistance rise. Schijf (1949) studied this limit velocity that\n\ncorresponds for lower critical velocity (also called subcritical velocity). Pompe?e (2015)\n\nmade the analytical theories for confined waters using two methods: energy method by\n\nSchijf (1949, 1953); and quantity of movement methods by Bouwmeester et al. (1977)\n\nand CNR (SAVEY, 1977; TENAUD, 1977; POMMIER; SELMI, 1981). These analytical\n\ntheories are complemented for the Schlichting\u2019s formulation.\n\nThe numerical calculation of the hydrodynamic flow of the inland vessel was based on\n\nreferences that influenced this study. From the conservation of mass to the conservation\n\nof momentum, the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations are the basis of the description of fluid\n\nmotion. Euler (1755) initiated this work for incompressible fluids and non-friction flows,\n\nNavier (1822) analyzed the friction effects for viscous fluids and Stokes (1845) improved\n\nthis work completing the solution.\n\nReynolds (1895) introduced the time-averaging of the flow for turbulent effects, defin-\n\ning the decomposition of a mean and fluctuating parts of a variable. This is applied\n\nto the NS equations and is called Reynolds-Averaging Navier-Stokes equations (RANS).\n\nThe choice of the turbulence model is necessary. Launder and Spalding (1972) were the\n\nfirst to introduce the standard k-? model. This model was refined and is called RNG\n\n(Re-Normalization Group methods) k-? model, and it was developed by Yakhot et al.\n\n(1992). Later, Shih et al. (1995) improved the turbulence model and is called Realizable\n\nk-?. Wilcox (1988) published another turbulent model denominated standard k-?. To im-\n\nprove k-? model, Menter (1993) developed the baseline (BSL, also called BSL k-? model)\n\nwhich was later refined for the transport of the turbulence shear stress and is called Shear\n\nStress Transport (SST) k-? model.\n\nNoh and Woodward (1976), and Hirt and Nichols (1981) developed the Volume of\n\nFluid method (VOF) to track and locate the free-surface. This method is based on\n\nMarker-and-cell method (MAC).\n\nThe interpolation of the convection term is used in the transport equation applied to\n\nFinite Volume Method (FVM). Courant, Isaacson and Rees (1952), and independently,\n\nGentry, Martin and Daly (1966); Barakat and Clark (1966); and Runchal and Wolfshtein\n\n(1969) introduced the 1st order upwind scheme. Another type of interpolation is the\n\n2nd order upwind scheme, started by Warming and Beam (1976), and Hodge, Stone and\n\nMiller (1979) for finite difference discretization.\n\n\n\n11\n\nPatankar and Spalding (1972) introduced the iterative method called the The Semi-\n\nImplicit Method for Pressure Linked Equations (SIMPLE) algorithm to resolve the linear\n\npressure-velocity couple.\n\n2.1 Important references\n\nThe following references are of high importance in this study.\n\n2.1.1 Celik et al. (2008)\n\nTheir work resulted in the development of the Grid Convergence Index (GCI) that is\n\nused in the estimation and report of uncertainty results in CFD applications. The method\n\nis based on the Richardson (1910) Extrapolation (RE) and is only applied to unstructured\n\nvolume domain. The authors justified that, if the user chooses to use it, this method shall\n\nnot be questioned. On the other hand, if the user chooses another method, this method\n\nshall be judged in the review process. However, the authors do not desire to discourage\n\nfurther development of new methods. This method is simple, justified and accepted, and\n\nis used in this study for the validation of the simulation results.\n\n2.1.2 ITTC (2014)\n\nThe ITTC creates a guideline, comprising of recommendations and practices regard-\n\ning the applications of CFD methods that is divided in three steps: pre-processing, com-\n\nputation, and post-processing. The geometry of the hull, the volume domain and the\n\ncomputational grid are defined during the pre-processing step. At computational step,\n\nthe governing equations to be solved are chosen. The visualization, analysis, verification\n\nand validation of the results belong to the post-processing step.\n\nIn this study, some of the values recommended in the guideline are adopted and\n\napplied to the equations. One of these recommended values is the wall y+, applied on the\n\nwall of the hull for the creation of the boundary layer in the grid mesh, which the ITTC\n\nprovides a range of possible options, among which the user shall choose the specific for\n\nthe purpose of the study. Later, the distance y of the first layer is calculated. The ITTC\n\n(1957) established the formulation for the frictional resistance coefficient that is explained\n\nin the next chapter.\n\nAccording to ITTC (2014), this is important because the value of wall y+ should be\n\n\n\n12\n\nchecked a posteriori once the solution is obtained. In this project, the wall y+ is simulated\n\nfor the wall hull surface and the wall bottom plane in the computational domain.\n\n2.1.3 Ji et al. (2012)\n\nTheir work is the study of prediction of the relationship between the geometrical and\n\nthe kinematic parameters of the convoy and the amplitude of ship generated waves in\n\nrestricted waterways. The authors used numerical simulations, solving the 3-D Navier-\n\nStokes, along with the standard k-? for turbulent.\n\nIn this paper, the calculation of the grid size in x direction is defined and the transver-\n\nsal wave length ? is estimated. Once is done, the value of ? is divided by 10 points, as\n\nthe authors recommend, obtaining the grid size.\n\n2.1.4 Linde et al. (2017)\n\nTheir work consists in the evaluation of the ship resistance in restricted waterways\n\nwith effects of ship sinkage and trim. The RANS solver coupled with a quasi-Newton\n\napproach is used to find the equilibrium position and the calculation of the ship sinkage.\n\nThe numerical simulation results are validated with towing tank tests and some empirical\n\nmodels.\n\nIn this study, the GCI method for grid convergence will be used with a constant\n\nrefinement ratio\n\nrk =\n?\n\n2. (2.1)\n\n2.1.5 Liu et al. (2017)\n\nThe authors evaluated the inland vessel resistance in confined waters. The effect of\n\nsquat is analyzed. They used the RANS equations to simulate the viscous flow around\n\nthe hull in a confined tank characterized by shallow sea bottom and close side walls.\n\nIn this study, computational domain is adopted, as illustrated in the Figure 2.1.\n\nDimensions extend by 1.5LWL from the bow to the inlet plane, 3.5LWL from stern to\n\nthe outlet plane and 0.33LWL from the free surface to the top plane. Additionally, the\n\nmeshing volume is configured and modified, as shown in Figure 2.2. The grid mesh in the\n\nvicinity of the free surface, hull, the tank bottom and the banks are refined. The prism\n\nlayer is used at the bottom boundary condition, with wall y+ larger than 30; at the hull\n\n\n\n13\n\nsurface, wall y+ is smaller than 1 in order to obtain a more precise flow field simulation\n\nnear the vessel.\n\nSome configurations of the boundary conditions are adopted. The velocity inlet is set\n\non the inlet and top plane. The pressure outlet is set on the outlet plane. The symmetry\n\ncondition is set on the symmetry plane. The wall condition is set on the rest of the planes,\n\nincluding the hull.\n\nFor the estimation of the numerical error and uncertainty about the results follow-\n\ning the grid discretization, the GCI is only applied to grid convergence with a constant\n\nrefinement ration defined in the equation (2.1).\n\nBottom\n\nInlet\n\noutlet\n\nSide\n\nTop\n\nFigure 4.

The direction of this force is opposite to the direction of the motion. The\n\ntotal resistance can be obtained through theoretical, experimental and computational\n\ncalculations. This chapter will define the basic components of the resistance. Following,\n\nthe resistance calculation methods will be described. Later, the shallow water effects will\n\nbe described considering that the resistance in depth water is different to the resistance\n\nin deep water. Finally, the existing empirical methods will be contextualized.\n\n3.1 Components of resistance\n\nThe total resistance is divided in basic components (shown in the Figures 3.1 and 3.2)\n\n(HARVALD, 1983; MOLLAND; TURNOCK; HUDSON, 2011):\n\n? Frictional resistance: frictional forces between water and hull surface due to tan-\n\ngential shear forces in direction of motion.\n\n? Pressure resistance: pressure force of water (normal forces) acting in the direction\n\nof motion.\n\n? Viscous resistance: is associated with the energy expended due to viscous effects.\n\n? Wave-making resistance: is associated with the energy generated by gravity waves\n\nduring navigation.\n\n? Viscous pressure resistance: is obtained by the integration of the components of the\n\nnormal stresses acting on the hull due to viscosity and turbulence.\n\nThe following list contains additional resistance components:\n\n? Residuary resistance: Considering the Froude\u2019s approach, the residuary resistance\n\ncan be obtained by subtracting the skin friction resistance from the total resistance.\n\n\n\n16\n\n? Wave-pattern resistance: is the resistance (deduced from measurements of wave\n\nelevations) where the wave pattern at a point remote from the vessel or model, is\n\nrelated, through a linearized theory, to the ship\u2019s or model\u2019s subsurface velocity\n\nfield and, therefore, the momentum of the fluid. This resistance does not include\n\nwave-breaking resistance.\n\n? Wave-breaking resistance: is associated with the breakdown of the vessel bow wave.\n\n? Spray resistance: is associated with the energy loss resulting from the spray gener-\n\nation.\n\n? Air resistance: is the resistance caused by the incident of wind/air on the vessel\n\nduring navigation.\n\n? Steering resistance: is the resistance caused by the rudder.\n\nThese specific components are shown in the Figure 3.3, where is represented in total\n\nresistance coefficient Ct giving as function of length Froude number FrL.\n\n14 Ship Resistance and Propulsion\n\nFigure 3.3. Measurement of total viscous resistance.\n\nIt should also be noted that each of the resistance components obeys a different\n\nset of scaling laws and the problem of scaling is made more complex because of\n\ninteraction between these components.\n\nA summary of these basic hydrodynamic components of ship resistance is shown\n\nin Figure 3.4. When considering the forces acting, the total resistance is made up of\n\nthe sum of the tangential shear and normal pressure forces acting on the wetted\n\nsurface of the vessel, as shown in Figure 3.2 and at the top of Figure 3.4. When\n\nconsidering energy dissipation, the total resistance is made up of the sum of the\n\nenergy dissipated in the wake and the energy used in the creation of waves, as shown\n\nin Figure 3.1 and at the bottom of Figure 3.4.\n\nFigure 3.5 shows a more detailed breakdown of the basic resistance compon-\n\nents together with other contributing components, including wave breaking, spray,\n\ntransom and induced resistance. The total skin friction in Figure 3.5 has been divided\n\ninto two-dimensional flat plate friction and three-dimensional effects. This is used to\n\nillustrate the breakdown in respect to some model-to-ship extrapolation methods,\n\ndiscussed in Chapter 4, which use flat plate friction data.\n\nWave breaking and spray can be important in high-speed craft and, in the case\n\nof the catamaran, significant wave breaking may occur between the hulls at partic-\n\nular speeds. Wave breaking and spray should form part of the total wavemaking\n\nTotal \n\nPressure\n\nViscous pressure\n\nFriction\n\nWave Viscous\n\nTotal\n\n( = Pressure + Friction\n\ni.e. local water forces acting on hull)\n\n( = Wave + Viscous\n\ni.e. energy dissipation)\n\n(Energy in wave pattern) (Energy lost in wake)\n\n(Note: in deeply submerged \n\nsubmarine (or aircraft) wave = 0 \n\nand Viscous pressure =  pressure)\n\n(Normal forces \n\non hull)\n\n(Tangential shear \n\nforces on hull)\n\nFigure 3.4. Basic resistance components.\n\nFigure 3.1: Basic resistance components. Source: Molland, Turnock and Hudson (2011).\n\nAccording to Froude hypothesis, the total resistance is represented by the following\n\nformula\n\nRt = Rr + Rf =\n1\n\n2\n?Sws?\n\n2Ct, (3.1)\n\n\n\n17Components of Hull Resistance 13\n\nWake\nWave pattern\n\nFigure 3.1. Waves and wake.\n\nBernoulli\u2019s theorem (see Appendix A1.5) states that P\ng\n\n+ V\n2\n\n2g\n+ h = H and, in\n\nthe absence of viscous forces, H is constant throughout the flow. By means of a\n\nPito?t tube, local total head can be measured. Since losses in total head are due to\n\nviscous forces, it is possible to measure the total viscous resistance by measuring the\n\ntotal head loss in the wake behind the hull, Figure 3.3.\n\nThis resistance will include the skin frictional resistance and part of the pressure\n\nresistance force, since the total head losses in the flow along the hull due to viscous\n\nforces result in a pressure loss over the afterbody which gives rise to a resistance due\n\nto pressure forces.\n\n(4) Total wave resistance\n\nThe wave pattern created by the hull can be measured and analysed into its\n\ncomponent waves. The energy required to sustain each wave component can be\n\nestimated and, hence, the total wave resistance component obtained.\n\nThus, by physical measurement it is possible to identify the following methods\n\nof breaking down the total resistance of a hull:\n\n1. Pressure resistance + frictional resistance\n2. Viscous resistance + remainder\n3. Wave resistance + remainder\n\nThese three can be combined to give a final resistance breakdown as:\n\nTotal resistance = Frictional resistance\n+ Viscous pressure resistance\n+ Wave resistance\n\nThe experimental methods used to derive the individual components of resistance\n\nare described in Chapter 7.\n\nP?\n\nFigure 3.2.

Ct is defined as\n\nCt = Cr + Cf, (3.2)\n\nwhere Cf and Cr are the frictional and the residuary resistance coefficients.\n\nThe International Towing Tank Conference (ITTC) studied proposals in order to\n\ndetermine the frictional resistance coefficient (HARVALD, 1983). ITTC (1957) proposed\n\n\n\n18\n\nthe Model-ship correlation line providing great accuracy. This coefficient is formulated as\n\nCf =\n0.075\n\n[log10(Re) ? 2]2\n, (3.3)\n\nwhere Re is the Reynolds number.\n\nReynolds (1883) studied the characterization of the fluid motion in which used flow\n\ncriteria that indicate whether the flow is laminar, turbulent or at transition stage (Ency-\n\nclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 2015f). The Reynolds number is given by\n\nRe =\nLWL?\n\n?\n, (3.4)\n\nwhere LWL is the length of the vessel in waterline and ? is kinematic viscosity of water,\n\nrepresented as\n\n? =\n\u00b5\n\n?\n, (3.5)\n\nwhere \u00b5 is the dynamic viscosity.\n\nThe residuary resistance coefficient is calculated according to Guldhammer\u2019s and Har-\n\nvald\u2019s method (1974)\n\nCr = f\n\n(\nFrL,\n\nLWL\n\n?\n1\n3\n\n, ?\n\n)\n, if\n\nB\n\nT\n= 2.5, (3.6)\n\nwhere FrL is the length Froude number, ? is the vessel\u2019s displacement, ? is the prismatic\n\ncoefficient of the vessel, B is the vessel\u2019s beam, and T is the vessel\u2019s draft. This coefficient\n\ncan be determined by nine diagrams (see the Figures from A.1 to A.9) for LWL/? ratios\n\nranging from 4 to 8 at intervals of 0.5. Additionally, each diagram provides the mean\n\ncurves of Cr for ? between 0.5 and 8.0. The values of FrL are between 0.15 and 0.45.\n\nThe diagrams refer to a B/T ratio equal to 2.5 and were obtained through experimental\n\ntests corresponding to ship models.\n\nGeorgakaki and Sorenson (2004) mentioned that the Guldhammer\u2019s and Harvald\u2019s\n\ncurves can extrapolate the values of Cr. In case of FrL lower than 0.15, is equal to the\n\nCr value for FrL equal to 0.15. The formulation involved is\n\n103Cr = E1 + G + H + K, (3.7)\n\nwhere\n\nE1 =\n(\nA0 + 1.5Fr\n\n1.8\nL + A1 + Fr\n\nN1\nL\n\n)[\n0.98 +\n\n2.5\n\n(M ? 2)4\n]\n\n+ (M ? 5)4(FrL ? 0.1)4, (3.8)\n\nA0 = 1.35 ? 0.23M + 0.012M2, (3.9)\n\n\n\n19\n\nA1 = 0.0011M\n9.1, (3.10)\n\nN1 = 2M ? 3.7, (3.11)\n\nG =\nB1B2\nB3\n\n, (3.12)\n\nB1 = 7 ? 0.09M2, (3.13)\nB2 = (5? ? 2.5)2, (3.14)\nB3 = [600(FrL ? 0.315)2 + 1]1.5, (3.15)\nH = exp{80[FrL ?

(3.18)\n\nThe equation (3.7) is applicable to self-propelled vessels and convoys but does not applied\n\nto pushed convoys.\n\nThe Froude number Fr is the dimensionless quantity that indicates the influence\n\nof gravity on fluid motion (Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 2015c). In marine hydrodynamic\n\napplications, this is important to calculate the ship resistance using length Froude number.\n\nFor shallow waters, is applied the depth Froude number that will be explained in the next\n\nsubsection. The length Froude number is determined by\n\nFrL =\n??\ngLWL\n\n, (3.19)\n\nwhere g is the gravitational acceleration. The prismatic coefficient is given by\n\n? =\n?\n\nLWLBT?\n, (3.20)\n\nwhere ? is the midship section area coefficient of the vessel, represented by\n\n? =\nAims\nBT\n\n, (3.21)\n\nwhere Aims is the immersed midship area of the vessel.\n\nThe correction of the residuary resistance coefficient for vessels with beam to draft\n\nratio of value higher or lower than 2.5 is determined by\n\n103Cr = 10\n3CrB\n\nT\n=2.5\n\n+ 0.16\n\n(\nB\n\nT\n? 2.5\n\n)\n. (3.22)\n\n\n\n20\n\n3.2 Shallow water effects\n\nThe performance of a ship engaged in sea transport is different to the performance of\n\nan inland vessel due to aspects such as cruising velocities, maneuverability, stability and\n\nriver\u2019s/channel\u2019s geographic morphology and infrastructure. The term \u201cshallow water\u201d\n\nrefers to the boundaries close to the ship in vertical and horizontal direction.\n\nThe principal effects of shallow waters are (MOLLAND; TURNOCK; HUDSON,\n\n2011):\n\n? Effective increase in velocity and backflow;\n\n? Decrease in pressure under the hull;\n\n? Significant changes in sinkage and trim;\n\n? Increases in skin friction drag and wave resistance.\n\nShallow water effects are characterized by depth Froude number, related to the velocity\n\nof the vessel ?? and the local depth of the river h, obtained by\n\nFrh =\n???\ngh\n. (3.23)\n\nThe vessel produces system waves which travel with velocities that depends on the\n\nwater depth h and the wave length ?. In deep water, when h/? ratio is large, the wave\n\nvelocity is defined as\n\nc =\n\n?\ng?\n\n2?\nif\nh\n\n?\n? 1\n\n20\n. (3.24)\n\nIn shallow water, when the value of this relationship is small,\n\nc =\n?\ngh if\n\nh\n\n?\n<\n\n1\n\n20\n. (3.25)\n\nThe waves travel at the same velocity c as the velocity of the ship. In this case, c is known\n\nas the critical velocity (MOLLAND; TURNOCK; HUDSON, 2011).\n\nIn the Figure 3.4, shows the wave patterns. The propagation of the transversal waves\n\nsystem and divergent waves system occurs away from the vessel for subcritical values\n\n(Frh &lt;1), producing an angle of 35\u00b0. At critical velocity (Frh = 1) the wave angle is\n\nperpendicular to the track of ship, generating an angle of 0\u00b0. At supercritical velocities\n\n(Frh > 1), there is no transversal waves and the divergent waves produce wave with a\n\n\n\n21\n\npropagation angle\n\n? = cos?1\n(\n\n1\n\nFrh\n\n)\n, (3.26)\n\nbecause a gravity wave cannot travel at c >\n?\ngh. These observations can be visualized in\n\nthe Figure 3.5, and are the result of the experimental test according to Molland, Wilson\n\nand Taunton (2004).98 Ship Resistance and Propulsion\n\nDivergent wavesTransverse waves\n\nD\nire\n\nct\nio\n\nn \nof\n\n p\nro\n\npa\nga\n\ntio\nn\n\nof\n d\n\niv\ner\n\nge\nnt\n\n w\nav\n\nes\n\n(a) Sub-critical   Frh  &lt;1.0\n\n(b)    Super-critical  Frh > 1.0\n\n    cos\n?1\n\n(1/Frh)\n\n35\u00b0 \n\nFigure 6.1.

The flow is slower at the bow and the stern of the ship,\n\nand faster at midship. Before the flow touches the hull, the velocity is constant and no\n\npressure. When the flow is in contact in the bow and the stern, its velocity is zero and\n\nits pressure is high. At the middle of the body, the velocity of the flow is higher, and\n\nits pressure is lower according to Bernoulli\u2019s principle. The boundary layer of a body\n\nincreases significantly the viscous resistance. The pressure and the velocity distribution\n\ncan be altered due to vortex formation that occurs close to the hull surface (BERTRAM,\n\n2000).\n\n\n\n23\n\nFrL\n\nR\nw\n\nValues of h/LWL\n\nFigure 3.8: Effect of shallow water on wave-making resistance.

In the literature, the wave system is often (rather artificially)\ndecomposed into a primary and a secondary wave system:\n\nP\nre\n\nss\nu\n\nre\nV\n\ne\nlo\n\nci\nty\n\nFigure 3.2 \u2018Primary\u2019 wave system\n\n1. Primary wave system (Fig. 3.2)\nIn an ideal fluid with no viscosity, a deeply submerged body would have\nzero resistance (D\u2019Alembert\u2019s paradoxon). The flow would be slower\nat both ends of the body and faster in the middle. Correspondingly\nat each end the pressure will be higher than average, reaching at\none point stagnation pressure, and the pressure in the middle will\nbe lower than average. Now imagine a body consisting of the ship\nhull below the calm-water surface and its mirror image at the calm-\nwater surface (Fig. 3.3). This double body would create a certain\npressure distribution at the symmetry plane (calm-water surface) in an\ninfinite ideal fluid. Following Bernoulli\u2019s equation, we could express\na corresponding surface elevation (wave height) distribution for this\npressure distribution, yielding wave crests at the ship ends and a long\nwave trough along the middle. This is called the primary wave system.\nThe shape of the primary wave system is speed independent, e.g. the\nlocations of maxima, minima, and zero crossings are not affected by\nthe speed. The vertical scale (wave height) depends quadratically on the\nspeed.\n\n2. Secondary wave system (Fig. 3.4)\nAt the free surface, a typical wave pattern is produced and radiated down-\nstream. Even if we assume an ideal fluid with no viscosity, this wave\npattern will result in a resistance. The wave pattern consists of trans-\nverse and divergent waves. In deep water, the wave pattern is limited to\na wedge-shaped region with a half-angle of 19.5\u00b0. This angle is inde-\npendent of the actual shape of the ship. On shallow water, the half-angle\nwidens to 90\u00b0 (for depth Froude number Fnh D 1.0) and then becomes\nmore and more narrow for supercritical speeds above Fnh D 1. The ship\n\nFigure 3.9: Distribution of the velocity and the pressure of a fluid around a symmetry\nbody.

The depth Froude number Frh influences on wave resistance (Frh > 0.7);\n\n? The water-depth to draught ratio h/T influences the flow around the hull, indepen-\n\ndent of the Frh value (if h/T &lt;4);\n\n? For river width to vessel\u2019s beam ratio Bc/B, the flow around the hull changes (if\n\nBc/B &lt;4);\n\n?

Sub-critical and super-critical operating regions.\n\ncombines the effects of wave height and speed. For deep water, the energy is\n\nE = ?g2 H2 T2/16?, (6.8)\n\nwhere H is the wave height (m) and T is the wave period (s). This approach takes\n\naccount, for example, of those waves with long periods which, as they approach\n\nmore shallow water, may be more damaging to the environment.\n\nIn the case of shallow water,\n\nE = ?g H2?/8, (6.9)\n\nwhere ? = (gT2/2? )tanh(2? h/LW), h is the water depth and LW is the wave length.\nIn shallow water, most of the wave energy is contained in a single long-period\n\nwave with a relatively small decay of wave energy and wave height with distance\n\nfrom the ship. In [6.27] it is pointed out that if energy alone is used, the individual\n\ncomponents of wave height and period are lost, and it is recommended that the\n\ndescription of wash waves in shallow water should include both maximum wave\n\nheight and maximum wave energy.\n\nAbsolute values need to be applied to the criteria if they are to be employed by\n\nport, harbour or coastal authorities to regulate the speeds and courses of ships in\n\norder to control the impact of wave wash. A typical case may require a maximum\n\nwave height of say 280 mm at a particular location, [6.30], or 350 mm for 3 m water\n\ndepth and wave period 9 s [6.29].\n\nFrom the ship operational viewpoint, it is recommended that ships likely to\n\noperate frequently in shallow water should carry a graph such as that shown in\n\nFigure 6.7. This indicates how the ship should operate well below or well above\n\nthe critical speed for a particular water depth. Phillips and Hook [6.31] address the\n\nproblems of operational risks and give an outline of the development of risk assess-\n\nment passage plans for fast commercial ships.\n\nREFERENCES (CHAPTER 6)\n\n6.1 Lamb, H.

Source: Author.\n\n\n\n35\n\n4 NUMERICAL SIMULATION BY CFD\n\nThis chapter provides a systematic review of the main fundamentals regarding the\n\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). For this purpose, the equations that govern the\n\nmotions of the fluids are presented. First, the Navier-Stokes (NS) equation is used to\n\nobtain the Reynolds-Averaging Navier-Stokes (RANS) equation by means of Reynolds\n\ndecomposition. The Realizable k-? turbulence model and the Finite Volume Method\n\n(FVM) are applied in order to simulate the turbulent flow and in order to calculate values\n\nat specific points/small areas in a cell or element of a mesh, respectively. For tracking\n\nand locating the free surface between air and water, the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method\n\nis used. Additionally, the implementation of the boundary conditions is explained.\n\n4.1 Hypotheses\n\nThe computational methods, used in this paper, are based on the RANS equations\n\nin three dimensions applying the realizable k-? turbulence model. For the solution of the\n\nproblem, the following hypotheses are adopted:\n\n? The fluids (air and water) are incompressible and Newtonian;\n\n? The flows are three-dimensional and non-stationary;\n\n? The surface tension between air and water is ignored;\n\n? The calculation of the inland vessel\u2019s sinkage and trim will not be applied.\n\n4.2 Conservation of mass\n\nIs the principle in which the mass of an object, set of objects or any closed system\n\ndoes not remains unchanged over time. Its equation is represented mathematically by the\n\n\n\n36\n\nfollowing equation\n?\n\n?t\n\n?\nV\n\n?dV = ?\n?\nA\n\n?u \u00b7 ndA, (4.1)\n\nwhere A is the closed surface area that encloses a volume V (fixed in the space), u is the\n\nflow velocity vector and n is the normal vector. The left term is the rate of change of\n\nmass and the right term is the net inflow of mass (BATCHELOR, 1967). The equation\n\nmust be written as1, ?\nV\n\n[\n??\n\n?t\n+ ?\u00b7 (?u)\n\n]\ndV = 0, (4.2)\n\nand the integrand is identically zero everywhere in the fluid. This relation is valid for any\n\nvolume domain. Thus,\n??\n\n?t\n+ ?\u00b7 (?u) = 0, (4.3)\n\nwhere ? is the fluid density, t is time and ?\u00b7 is the divergence operator.\n\nThe equation above is called equation of continuity and is one of the fundamental\n\nequations of the fluid mechanics. In Cartesian coordinates, is expressed as\n\n??\n\n?t\n+\n\n?\n\n?xi\n(?ui) = 0, i = 1, 2, 3, (4.4)\n\nwhere xi are components of Cartesian coordinates and ui are components of velocity\n\nvector. If the fluid is considered incompressible, the equation is reduced to a simpler\n\ncondition\n\n?\u00b7 u = 0, (4.5)\n\nin Cartesian coordinates,\n?ui\n?xi\n\n= 0. (4.6)\n\n4.3 Conservation of momentum\n\nIs associated with Newton\u2019s second law where, in a closed system, the total momen-\n\ntum is constant. For fluids, where the material surface Smat encloses the volume, the\n\nmomentum is estimated by ?\nV\n\n?udV, (4.7)\n\nand its rate of change is\n\n1Using the divergence theorem, the net inflow of mass is expressed by\n\n?\n?\nA\n\n?u \u00b7ndA = ?\n?\nV\n\n?\u00b7 (?u)dV\n\n\n\n37\n\nd\n\ndt\n\n?\nV\n\n?udV =\n\n?\nV\n\nDu\n\nDt\n?dV =\n\n?\nV\n\n?FidV +\n\n?\nSmat\n\n?ijnjdSmat,\n\n=\n\n?\nV\n\n?FidV +\n\n?\nV\n\n??ij\n?xj\n\ndV, (4.8)\n\nwhere nj are components of the normal vector to the surface. The integrand is identically\n\nzero everywhere in the fluid. Hence2\n\n?\nDu\n\nDt\n= ?Fi +\n\n??ij\n?xj\n\n, (4.9)\n\n?\n\n?t\n(?u) + ?(u \u00b7?u) = Fb + Fs, (4.10)\n\nwhere Fb are the body forces, Fs are the surface forces and ? is the nabla operator.\n\nThe body forces are those that are applied to the entire mass of the fluid element,\n\nsuch as the gravity force. These forces are expressed as\n\nFb = ?Fi = ?g, (4.11)\n\nwhere Fi are components of the force vector and g is the vector acceleration of gravity.\n\nThe surface forces are those that act across the surface, shown in the Figure 4.1, and are\n\ngiven by\n\nFs =\n??ij\n?xj\n\n= ?\u00b7 ?ij, (4.12)\n\nwhere ?ij are components of the tensor stress.\n\nReplacing the equations (4.11) and (4.12) into the equation (4.9), the Newton\u2019s second\n\nlaw for fluids now becomes (WHITE, 1991)\n\n?\n?u\n\n?t\n+ ?(u \u00b7?u) = ?g + ?\u00b7 ?ij, (4.13)\n\nin Cartesian coordinates,\n\n?\n\n?t\n(?ui) +\n\n?\n\n?xj\n(?uiuj) = ?g +\n\n??ij\n?xj\n\n.

Moreover, the shear and strain rates\n\nare linearly related in these cases. On the other hand, non-Newtonian fluids do not follow\n\nNewtonian\u2019s law of viscosity. As a matter of fact, their viscosity is dependent of shear rate\n\nand/or shear rate viscosity.

The\n\nequation is the result of deformation law and it was introduced by Stokes (1845)4.\n\n4.3.2 The Navier-Stokes equation\n\nThe Navier-Stokes (NS) equation is a partial differential equation that describes the\n\nmotion of the viscous fluid. Euler was the first to describe the ideal equation for incom-\n\npressible and frictionless fluids. His works was devised in 17th century and published in\n\n1755. Navier (1822) introduced the friction (element viscosity) for more realistic problems\n\nof viscous fluids. Stokes (1845) improved on this work although the complete solutions\n\nwere obtained only for the case of simple two-dimensional flows (Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica,\n\n2015e).\n\nSubstituting the equation (4.16) into the equation (4.13),\n\n?\n?u\n\n?t\n+ ?(u \u00b7?u) = ?g ??p + ?\u00b7\n\n{\n\u00b5\n\n[\n?u + (?u)T ? 2\n\n3\n?ij(?\u00b7 u)I\n\n]}\n.

(4.21)\n\nIf the fluid is incompressible, the equation is reduced in simple terms,\n\n?\n?u\n\n?t\n+ ?(u \u00b7?u) = ??p? + \u00b5?2u, (4.22)\n\nin Cartesian coordinates,\n\n?\n\n?t\n(?ui) +\n\n?\n\n?xj\n(?uiuj) = ?\n\n?p?\n\n?xi\n+ \u00b5\n\n(\n?2ui\n?x2i\n\n)\n, (4.23)\n\nwhere ?2 is the Laplace operator.\n\n4.4 Reynolds-Averaging\n\nIn Reynolds averaging or Reynolds decomposition, introduced in 1895, a quantity is\n\ndecomposed into a mean (ensemble-averaged or time-averaged) and a fluctuating parts.\n\nConsider a stationary turbulent flow. For the velocity components is decomposed by\n\nui(x, t) = Ui(x) + u\n?\ni(x, t), (4.24)\n\nwhere Ui(x) is the mean velocity, u\n?\ni(x, t) is the fluctuating velocity and x is the position\n\nvector in vector notation.\n\nThe mean velocity is defined by\n\nUi(x) = lim\nTs??\n\n1\n\nTs\n\n? t+Ts\nt\n\nui(x, t)dt, (4.25)\n\nwhere Ts is a long time to relevant period of the fluctuations in ui. The equation (4.25)\n\nis again the same time-averaged value,\n\nUi(x) = lim\nTs??\n\n1\n\nTs\n\n? t+Ts\nt\n\nUi(x)dt = Ui(x), (4.26)\n\nwhere an overbar is shorthand for the time average. The time-averaging of the fluctuating\n\nvelocity is\n\nu?i(x) = lim\nTs??\n\n1\n\nTs\n\n? t+Ts\nt\n\n[ui(x, t) ?Ui(x)] dt = Ui(x) ?Ui(x) = 0.

Spalart-\n\nAllmaras, k-? and k-? are common models that employ the Boussinesq hypothesis. In\n\nthis study, the realizable k-? turbulence model is adopted.\n\n4.6.1 Realizable k-? model\n\nIs a two-equation turbulence model widely adopted. Initially is developed by Launder\n\nand Spalding (1972) in standard form and is based on the model transport equations for\n\nTKE and the dissipation rate ?. Later, Yakhot et al. (1992) refined this model (called\n\nRNG k-?). Finally, this model was improved by Shih et al. (1995), called Realizable k-?,\n\nand is described by\n\n?\n\n?t\n(?k) +\n\n?\n\n?xj\n(?kUj) =\n\n?\n\n?xj\n\n[(\n\u00b5 +\n\n\u00b5t\n?k\n\n)\n?k\n\n?xj\n\n]\n+ Pk + Pb ????YM + Sk, (4.38)\n\n?\n\n?t\n(??) +\n\n?\n\n?xj\n(??Uj) =\n\n?\n\n?xj\n\n[(\n\u00b5 +\n\n\u00b5t\n??\n\n)\n??\n\n?xj\n\n]\n+ ?C1S???C2\n\n?2\n\nk +\n?\n??\n\n+ C1?\n?\n\nk\nC3?Pb + S?\n\n(4.39)\n\n\n\n43\n\nwhere\n\nC1 = max\n\n[\n0.43,\n\n?\n\n? + 5\n\n]\n, ? = S1\n\nk\n\n?\n, S1 =\n\n?\n2SijSij. (4.40)\n\nPk represents the generation of TKE due to the mean velocity gradients,YM represents\n\nthe contribution of the fluctuating dilatation in compressible turbulence to the overall\n\ndissipation rate, Sk and S? are user-defined source terms. Pk and \u00b5t are given by\n\n\u00b5t = ?C\u00b5\nk2\n\n?\n, (4.41)\n\nPk = ??u?iu?j\n?Uj\n?xi\n\n. (4.42)\n\nThe physic interpretation of C\u00b5, YM and the constant C3? are given in Shih et al. (1995)\n\nand ANSYS (2017). The model constants C1?, C2, ?k and ?? have the following default\n\nvalues: C1? = 1.44, C2 = 1.9, ?k = 1.0 and ?? = 1.2.\n\n4.7 Volume of Fluid method\n\nThe Volume of Fluid (VOF) is a method that can model immiscible5 fluids for tracking\n\nand locating the free surface. Initially, the method was developed by Noh and Woodward\n\n(1976) and later by Hirt and Nichols (1981).\n\nIn the Figure 4.4a shows an example of a interface between two fluids with an actual\n\nshape and the Figure 4.4b is illustrated an approximation to the reconstruction of interface\n\nof the fluids in a grid mesh of a computational domain. Each cell indicates the fill rate of\n\na fluid (material 1). The volume fraction of a fluid q is denoted by ?q and is defined as\n\n?q =\nVq\nV\n\n(4.43)\n\nwhere Vq is the volume of a fluid in the cell and V is the volume of the cell. The volume\n\nfractions of two fluids in a cell must sum up to one\n\nNfluids?\nq=1\n\n?q = 1 (4.44)\n\nwhere Nfluids is the total number of fluids.\n\nFor each cell of the volume fraction follows three conditions:\n\n? ?q = 0, the cell is empty (of the q\nth fluid);\n\n5Incapable of mixing or attaining homogeneity (Merriam-Webster, 2004).\n\n\n\n44\n\nFigure 4.4: An example of VOF method, where shows the interface between two fluids (a)\nand is the approximation of the fluid interface in a grid mesh of a computational domain\n(b). Source: Pathak and Raessi (2016).\n\n? ?q = 1, the cell is full (of the q\nth fluid);\n\n? 0 &lt;?q &lt;1 The cell contains the interface between the q\nth fluid and the other fluid.\n\nThe density and viscosity applying VOF method for each cell can be computed as\n\n? =\n2?\nq=1\n\n?q?q (4.45)\n\n\u00b5 =\n2?\nq=1\n\n?q\u00b5q (4.46)\n\n4.8 Implementation of boundary conditions\n\nGenerally, all CFD problems define initial boundary conditions of a computational\n\ndomain (Figure 4.5). The most common boundary conditions are: inlet, outlet, wall, and\n\nsymmetry (VERSTEEG; MALALASEKERA, 2007).\n\n4.8.1 Inlet boundary condition\n\nThe total pressure at inlet boundary conditions is given by\n\npin =\n1\n\n2\nU2in + (???0)|??g |[g? \u00b7 (b ? a)] (4.47)\n\nwhere a is any point on the free surface and b is the position vectors in the center of the\n\nsurface of an element, U2in is a mean velocity vector at inlet boundary condition, |??g | is\n\n\n\n45\n\nFigure 4.5: Boundary domain to imposes the boundary conditions in a control-volume.\nSource: Author.\n\nthe gravity magnitude, g? is the unity vector of gravity, and ?0 is the reference density.\n\nThe approximation of the TKE and ? at inlet are represented by (VERSTEEG;\n\nMALALASEKERA, 2007; ANSYS, 2017)\n\nkin =\n3\n\n2\n(UinI)\n\n2, (4.48)\n\n?in = C\u00b5\n?k2\n\n\u00b5\n\n(\n\u00b5t\n\u00b5\n\n)?1\n, (4.49)\n\nwhere C\u00b5 is an empirical constant specified in the turbulence model (determined in the\n\nsection 4.6). I is the turbulence intensity, defined as the ratio of the velocity fluctuations\n\nu?i to the mean flow velocity Ui, represented by\n\nI ? u\n?\ni\n\nUi\n. (4.50)\n\nThe turbulent viscosity ratio \u00b5t\n\u00b5\n\nis directly proportional to the turbulent Reynolds number\n\nRet ?\nk2\n\n??\n, (4.51)\n\nand the turbulence parameters are: 1 &lt;\u00b5t\n\u00b5\n&lt;10.\n\n\n\n46\n\n4.8.2 Outlet boundary condition\n\nThe pressure at outlet boundary condition is taken equal to the static or atmospheric\n\npressure\n\npout = (???0)|??g |(g? \u00b7 (b ? a)). (4.52)\n\nThe flow often reaches a fully developed state in the flow direction if the outlet of the\n\ncomputational domain is chosen far from geometric disturbance. Thus, we can put an\n\nexit surface assuming the gradients of all variables are equal to zero in the flow direction\n\n(LAUNDER; SPALDING, 1972; VERSTEEG; MALALASEKERA, 2007; DEWAN, 2011;\n\nJI, 2013). Thus,\n\n?Uout\n?n\n\n= 0,\n?kout\n?n\n\n= 0,\n??out\n?n\n\n= 0, (4.53)\n\nwhere Uout, kout and ?out are variables at outlet flow and n is the normal vector of the\n\nsurface.\n\n4.8.3 Wall boundary condition\n\nThe region near to the wall can be modeled by means of the near-wall treatment.\n\nThis approach does not include the wall, where the no-slip condition is adopted, which\n\ncan lead to unsatisfactory results for the k-? turbulence model.\n\nThe no-slip condition implies that the velocity components and the gradients of the\n\npressure, TKE and ? are equal to zero\n\nUwall \u00b7 n = 0,\n?Pwall\n?n\n\n= 0,\n?kwall\n?n\n\n= 0, (4.54)\n\nwhere n is the local coordinate normal to the wall. Also, the velocity fluctuation u?i is\n\nzero. Thus, the value of TKE can be computed as (DURBIN; Pettersson Rief, 2011; JI,\n\n2013)\n\nkwall =\n1\n\n2\n|u?i|2 = 0. (4.55)\n\nThe adoption of the k-? turbulence model closes to the wall at High Reynolds Number\n\n(HRN). The law-of-the-wall for mean velocity and TKE on standard wall functions yields\n\nu+Q =\nUQ\nu?\n\n=\n1\n\n?\nln(Ey+Q) (4.56)\n\nkQ =\nu2??\nC\u00b5\n\n(4.57)\n\n\n\n47\n\nwhere u+Q is the dimensionless velocity, y\n+\nQ is the dimensionless distance from the wall (for\n\n30 &lt;y+Q &lt;500, it satisfies the equation in the logarithmic region), E is the empirical\n\nconstant (wall roughness parameter), equivalent to 9.793 for smooth walls, ? is the von\n\nKa?rma?n constant (equal to 0.4187), UQ is the mean velocity of the fluid at the wall-\n\nadjacent cell centroid Q, yQ is the distance from the centroid of the wall-adjacent cell to\n\nthe wall B (Figure 4.6) and u? is the friction or shear velocity, represented as\n\nu? =\n\n?\n?wall\n?\n\n(4.58)\n\nwhere ?wall is the shear stress at the wall.\n\nB\n\nn\n\nQ\n\nyQ\n\nx\n\ny\n\nz\n\nFigure 4.6: Calculation of distance yQ between node Q and the surface on the wall B.\nSource: Ji (2013).\n\nFor k-? model, the wall function developed by Launder and Spalding (1974) is differ-\n\nent. In order to avoid confusion in the nomenclature, the equation (4.56) according to y+Q\n\nfor k-? model and its variables are represented by\n\nu?Q =\n1\n\n?\nln(Ey?Q) (4.59)\n\ny?Q =\nC\n\n1\n4\n\u00b5\n\n?\nkQ\n\n?\n(4.60)\n\nwhere ? is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid. The equations (4.56) and (4.59) (that corre-\n\nspond to the logarithm-law) are adopted when log y+Q and log y\n?\nQ present values larger that\n\n11.225. Otherwise, the relationships between u+Q and y\n+\nQ (also u\n\n?\nQ and y\n\n?\nQ) are expressed\n\nby\n\nu+Q = y\n+\nQ u\n\n?\nQ = y\n\n?\nQ. (4.61)\n\nas illustrated in the Figure 4.7, where the plot is divided in three sub-regions: viscous\n\nsub-layer (y+ &lt;5), buffer layer (y+ &lt;30), and log-law layer (30 ? y+ ? 500).\n\n\n\n48\n\n3.4 CHARACTERISTICS OF SIMPLE TURBULENT FLOWS 59\n\nFigure 3.11 Velocity\ndistribution near a solid wall\nSource: Schlichting, H. (1979)\nBoundary Layer Theory, 7th edn,\nreproduced with permission of \nThe McGraw-Hill Companies\n\nNumerical values for the constants are found from measurements. We find\nvon Karman\u2019s constant ? ? 0.4 and the additive constant B ? 5.5 (or E ? 9.8)\nfor smooth walls; wall roughness causes a decrease in the value of B. The \nvalues of ? and B are universal constants valid for all turbulent flows past\nsmooth walls at high Reynolds number. Because of the logarithmic relation-\nship between u+ and y+, formula (3.18) is often called the log-law, and the\nlayer where y+ takes values between 30 and 500 the log-law layer.\n\nOuter layer --- the inertia-dominated region far from the wall\n\nExperimental measurements show that the log-law is valid in the region \n0.02 &lt;y/? &lt;0.2. For larger values of y the velocity-defect law (3.17) \nprovides the correct form. In the overlap region the log-law and velocity-\ndefect law have to be equal. Tennekes and Lumley (1972) show that a\nmatched overlap is obtained by assuming the following logarithmic form:\n\n= ? ln + A (3.20)\n\nwhere A is a constant. This velocity-defect law is often called the law of the\nwake.\n\nFigure 3.11 from Schlichting (1979) shows the close agreement between\ntheoretical equations (3.18) and (3.19) in their respective areas of validity and\nexperimental data.\n\nD\nE\nF\n\ny\n\n?\n\nA\nB\nC\n\n1\n\n?\n\nUmax ?

In order of increasing distance\nfrom the wall we have:\n\u2013 the linear sub-layer: viscous stresses dominate the flow adjacent to\n\nsurface\n\u2013 the buffer layer: viscous and turbulent stresses are of similar magnitude\n\u2013 the log-law layer: turbulent (Reynolds) stresses dominate.\n\nu+Q\n\nlog y+Q\n\nu+Q = y\n+\nQ\n\nu+Q =\n1\n\n?\nln(Ey+Q)\n\nFigure 4.7: Velocity distribution near a solid wall.

(4.64)\n\nAt Low Reynolds Number (LRN), the equation (4.56) is not valid for log y+Q &lt;11.225\n\nor y+Q &lt;30, and the equations above mentioned for the wall boundary conditions cannot\n\nbe used (VERSTEEG; MALALASEKERA, 2007).\n\n4.8.4 Symmetry boundary condition\n\nAt this boundary condition, the gradients of all flow properties normal to the sym-\n\nmetry plane are taken equal to zero (DEWAN, 2011), i.e.,\n\n?Usym\n?n\n\n= 0,\n?ksym\n?n\n\n= 0,\n??sym\n?n\n\n= 0, (4.65)\n\nwhere Usym, ksym and ?sym are variables located at symmetry plane.\n\n\n\n49\n\n4.9 Finite Volume Method\n\nThe Finite Volume6 Method (FVM) is a numerical method of discretization7 that\n\nallows solve partial differential equations (PDE) applied to conservation laws. Is similar\n\nto the Finite Element Method (FEM) or the Finite Difference Method (FDM) and uses\n\nintegral formulations of conservation laws and does not require a structured grid mesh.\n\nConsider the unsteady conservation equation for transport of a fluid property ? in a\n\ncell volume V as follows8 (VERSTEEG; MALALASEKERA, 2007; CD-adapco, 2014)?\nV\n\n?\n\n?t\n(??)dV +\n\n?\n??u \u00b7dA =\n\n?\n???? \u00b7dA +\n\n?\nV\n\nS?dV, (4.66)\n\nwhere u is the velocity vector, A is the surface area vector, ?? is the diffusion coefficient\n\nfor ?, ?? is the gradient of ? and S? is the source of ? per unit volume.

The second term is the net rate of decrease of fluid property ? across the cell\n\nboundaries due to convection (convection term);\n\n? The third term is the net rate of increase of fluid property ? across the cell bound-\n\naries due to diffusion (diffusion term);\n\n?

For\n\nthis purpose, a model which was tested and provided by the IPT was used. This model\n\nwas digitally modeled and, subsequently, was carried out a comparative analysis based on\n\nthe original IPT model and the CAD modeled hull. In this study, the mesh applied for\n\nthe geometry, the boundary conditions and the solver parameters, as well as the results\n\nare presented and visualized.\n\n5.1 Methodology\n\nIn the method, the market in which the vessel will operate, the physical restrictions\n\nof the river and the data obtained from existing inland vessels are considered. Once\n\nthe hull design is chosen, the hull resistance is calculated by three ways. The first is\n\nthe experimental test evaluated in the towing tank on IPT. The second is the empirical\n\nprocedure (explained in the chapter 3) and is accomplished inside the parameters. The\n\nthird is the procedure using CFD (Figure 5.1). The mesh is generated with the design of\n\nthe geometry domain. Later, initial physical conditions are configured. Before running\n\nthe solution (explained in the chapter 4), the time step and the maximum simulation time\n\nmust be determined. After that, the results are analyzed and the experimental results are\n\ncompared to the empirical results. The above are described in the Figure 5.2.\n\n5.2 Experimental test in model scale\n\nConsists of placing the model in a towing tank with a carriage that travels along the\n\nbasin.

This type of similarity is applied to objects with area\n\n\n\n58\n\nand volume, such as a wing shown in the Figure 5.4. The scale ratio is defined as,\n\n? =\ndp\ndm\n\n, ?2 =\nd2p\nd2m\n\n, ?3 =\nd3p\nd3m\n\n, (5.1)\n\nwhere dp and dm are the dimensional lengths of the prototype and the model respectively.\n\neasier said than done, as we now discuss. There are specialized texts on model\ntesting [30\u201332].\n\nInstead of complete similarity, the engineering literature speaks of particular types\nof similarity, the most common being geometric, kinematic, dynamic, and thermal.\nLet us consider each separately.\n\nGeometric similarity concerns the length dimension {L} and must be ensured before\nany sensible model testing can proceed. A formal definition is as follows:\n\nA model and prototype are geometrically similar if and only if all body dimensions\nin all three coordinates have the same linear scale ratio.\n\nNote that all length scales must be the same. It is as if you took a photograph of the\nprototype and reduced it or enlarged it until it fitted the size of the model. If the model\nis to be made one-tenth the prototype size, its length, width, and height must each be\none-tenth as large. Not only that, but also its entire shape must be one-tenth as large,\nand technically we speak of homologous points, which are points that have the same\nrelative location. For example, the nose of the prototype is homologous to the nose\nof the model. The left wingtip of the prototype is homologous to the left wingtip of\nthe model. Then geometric similarity requires that all homologous points be related\nby the same linear scale ratio. This applies to the fluid geometry as well as the model\ngeometry.\n\nAll angles are preserved in geometric similarity. All flow directions are preserved.\nThe orientations of model and prototype with respect to the surroundings must be\nidentical.\n\nFigure 5.4 illustrates a prototype wing and a one-tenth-scale model. The model\nlengths are all one-tenth as large, but its angle of attack with respect to the free stream\nis the same for both model and prototype: 10\u00b0 not 1\u00b0. All physical details on the model\nmust be scaled, and some are rather subtle and sometimes overlooked:\n\n1. The model nose radius must be one-tenth as large.\n\n2. The model surface roughness must be one-tenth as large.\n\nGeometric Similarity\n\n322 Chapter 5 Dimensional Analysis and Similarity\n\n10\u00b0\n\nVp\n\n(a)\n\na\nHomologous\n\npoints\n\na\n\nVm\n\n10\u00b0\n\n40 m\n\n8 m\n0.8 m\n\n4 m\n\n(b)\n\n   *1 m\n   *0.1 m\n\nFig. 5.4 Geometric similarity in\nmodel testing: (a) prototype;\n(b) one-tenth-scale model.\n\nwhi29346_ch05_292-345.qxd  11/4/09  10:36  Page 322 Debd 208:MHDQ176:whi29346:0073529346:whi29346_pagefiles:\n\nFigure 5.4: Example of geometric similarity in model testing. Left, prototype; right, scale\nmodel. Source: White (2011).\n\n5.2.2 Kinematic similarity\n\nThe velocity of the flow at any point in the model must have the same direction as\n\nthe velocity of the flow in the prototype. It means, the motions of the systems must be\n\nsimilar as illustrated in the Figure 5.5.\n\n(by a constant scale factor) to the velocity at the corresponding point in the\nprototype flow (Fig. \u20131 ). Specifically, for kinematic similarity the velocity\nat corresponding points must scale in magnitude and must point in the same\nrelative direction. You may think of geometric similarity as length-scale\nequivalence and kinematic similarity as time-scale equivalence. eometric\nsimilarity is a prere uisite for inematic similarity. ust as the geometric\nscale factor can be less than, equal to, or greater than one, so can the velocity\nscale factor. In Fig. \u20131 , for example, the geometric scale factor is less than\none (model smaller than prototype), but the velocity scale is greater than one\n(velocities around the model are greater than those around the prototype).\nYou may recall from Chap.  that streamlines are kinematic phenomena\nhence, the streamline pattern in the model flow is a geometrically scaled\ncopy of that in the prototype flow when kinematic similarity is achieved.\n\nThe third and most restrictive similarity condition is that of yna ic si -\nilarity Dynamic similarity is achieved when all forces in the model flow\nscale by a constant factor to corresponding forces in the prototype flow\n(force-scale equivalence). As with geometric and kinematic similarity, the\nscale factor for forces can be less than, equal to, or greater than one. In Fig.\n\u20131  for example, the force-scale factor is less than one since the force on\n\nthe model building is less than that on the prototype. inematic similarity is\na necessary ut insufficient condition for dynamic similarity. It is thus pos-\nsible for a model flow and a prototype flow to achieve both geometric and\nkinematic similarity, yet not dynamic similarity. All three similarity condi-\ntions must exist for complete similarity to be ensured.\n\nIn a general flow field, complete similarity between a model and prototype is\nachieved only when there is geometric, kinematic, and dynamic similarity.\n\nWe let uppercase reek letter i (?) denote a nondimensional parameter.\nYou are already familiar with one ?, namely the Froude number, Fr. In a\ngeneral dimensional analysis problem, there is one ? that we call the\n\ne en ent ?, giving it the notation ?1. The parameter ?1 is in general a\nfunction of several other ?\u2019s, which we call in e en ent ?\u2019s. The func-\ntional relationship is\nFunctional relationship et een ?\u2019s: (7\u201311)\n\nwhere is the total number of ?\u2019s.\nConsider an experiment in which a scale model is tested to simulate a\n\nprototype flow. To ensure complete similarity between the model and the\nprototype, each independent ? of the model (subscript m) must be identical\nto the corresponding independent ? of the prototype (subscript p), i.e., ?2, m\n? ?2, p, ? , m ? ? , p, . . . , ? m ? ? p.\n\nTo ensure complete similarity, the model and prototype must be geometrically\nsimilar, and all independent ? groups must match between model and\nprototype.\n\nnder these conditions the dependent ? of the model (?1, m) is guaranteed\nto also equal the dependent ? of the prototype (?1, p). athematically, we\nwrite a conditional statement for achieving similarity,\n\n(7\u201312)then  ?1, m ? ?1, p\n\nIf    ?2, m ? ?2, p  and  ? , m ? ? , p? p   and  ? , m ? ? , p,\n\n?1 ? f (?2, ? ,? p ?, ? )\n\n278\nFLUID MECHANICS\n\nrototype:\n\nodel:\n\nVp\n\nVm\n\nFD  m\n\nFD  p\n\nFIGURE 7\u201316\ninematic similarity is achieved when,\n\nat all locations, the velocity in the\nmodel flow is proportional to that \nat corresponding locations in the\nprototype flow, and points in the \nsame direction.\n\nFigure 5.5: Example of kinematic similarity in model testing.

It\n\nimplies that the dimensionless parameters, such as Reynolds and Froude numbers, must\n\nbe equal.\n\n\n\n59\n\nIf the values of the Reynolds number are equal for different characteristic lengths of\n\nthe prototype and the model, the velocity of the model will be high and, as a result, the\n\nevaluation in the towing tank will be impossible. On the other hand, the Froude number\n\nsimilarity could be used because the velocity of the model must be less than the velocity\n\nof the prototype. In the Figure 5.6 shows an experiment, where the prototype and model\n\nare identical homogeneous force.\n\nand the time scale is\n\n(5.33)\n\nThese Froude-scaling kinematic relations are illustrated in Fig. 5.6b for wave motion\nmodeling. If the waves are related by the length scale ?, then the wave period, prop-\nagation speed, and particle velocities are related by \n\nIf viscosity, surface tension, or compressibility is important, kinematic similarity\ndepends on the achievement of dynamic similarity.\n\nDynamic similarity exists when the model and the prototype have the same length\nscale ratio, time scale ratio, and force scale (or mass scale) ratio. Again geometric\nsimilarity is a first requirement; without it, proceed no further. Then dynamic simi-\nlarity exists, simultaneous with kinematic similarity, if the model and prototype force\nand pressure coefficients are identical. This is ensured if\n\n1. For compressible flow, the model and prototype Reynolds number and Mach\nnumber and specific-heat ratio are correspondingly equal.\n\n2. For incompressible flow\n\na. With no free surface: model and prototype Reynolds numbers are equal.\n\nb. With a free surface: model and prototype Reynolds number, Froude\nnumber, and (if necessary) Weber number and cavitation number are corre-\nspondingly equal.\n\nMathematically, Newton\u2019s law for any fluid particle requires that the sum of the pres-\nsure force, gravity force, and friction force equal the acceleration term, or inertia force,\n\nFp ? Fg ? Ff ? Fi\n\nThe dynamic similarity laws listed above ensure that each of these forces will be in\nthe same ratio and have equivalent directions between model and prototype.

This plan is composed by the\n\nsheer profile (in perspective view which is divided in sections); the body plan (that shows\n\nthe half symmetrical sections in the fore and aft); and the half-breadth plan (top view)\n\nwhich displays the half symmetrical sections (port and starboard side) at each waterline\n\n(levels of hull draft). In the Figure 5.7 illustrates an example of a lines-plan.\n\nThe offsets are the representation of the lines plan in numbers organized in tables\n\n(that provide the coordinates of the points the sum of which results in the formation of\n\nthe hull\u2019s lines). The original hull model designed by IPT is composed by 137 sheers and\n\n7 waterlines, described in the Figures B.1 and B.2. These offsets are adapted digitally,\n\nusing the portable software FREE!ship (ENGELAND, 2006). This program uses a simple\n\nmodeling, creating interpolation points for lines and the generation of surfaces, observed in\n\nFigure 5.8. Also, it was possible the analysis of the lines-plan that is generated digitally\n\n(Figure 5.9) and is compared with the original lines-plan of the hull, including their\n\ndimensions (Table 5.1).\n\n\n\n60\n34\n\nD\nE\n\nF\nIN\n\nIT\nIO\n\nN\n A\n\nN\nD\n\n R\nE\n\nG\nU\n\nL\nA\n\nT\nIO\n\nN\n\nHalf breadth\nplan\n\nCL\n0 1\n\n12 m waterline\n\n12 m waterline\n\n8 m waterline\n\n8 m buttock\n\n8 m buttock\n4 m buttock\n\n2 m buttock\n4 m buttock\n\n2 m buttock\nUpper deck Upper deck\n\nSheer\nprofile\n\n8 m waterline4 m waterline\n4 m waterline\n\n2 m waterline\n\n2 m waterline\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\n4\n\nm\n\n12\n\n18\n\n1\n\n1\u00bd\n\n0\nBody plan\n\n4\n\n4\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\n6 7\n\n7\n\n8\n\n4 5 6\n\n6\n\n7 8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n9\nUpper deck\n\n10\n\n8\u00bd\n\n8\u00bd\n\n9\u00bd\n\n8\u00bd0 1 2 31\u00bd\n\n1\u00bd 9\n\n9\n\n9\u00bd\n\n9\u00bd\n\n10\n\n10\n\nUp\nper\n\n de\nck\n\n\u00bd\n\n\u00bd\n\n\u00bd\n\nFigure 3.4 Lines plan\n\nC\nh\na\np\n-\n0\n3\n.\nq\nx\nd\n \n \n3\n~\n9\n~\n0\n4\n \n \n1\n4\n:\n4\n3\n \n \nP\na\ng\ne\n \n3\n4\n\nFigure 5.7: Example of a lines-plan.

Source: Author.\n\n5.4.1 Mesh\n\nAfter defining the geometry of the computational domain, the mesh is realized, which\n\nit is divided into surface mesh and volume. The STAR-CCM+ (CD-adapco, 2014) soft-\n\nware allows the creation of unstructured surface mesh and structured volume mesh.\n\nFor this study, it is important to discretize the regions of greatest interest, where the\n\nmodification of the cell size is refined. The remainder of volume of the computational\n\ndomain is maintained at base size of the cell. The regions around the hull are important\n\nbecause pressure and shear forces are obtained through the model, followed by the free\n\nsurface due to the tracking of waves. Six regions of refined mesh are defined in the Table\n\n5.3 and is illustrated in the Figure 5.11.\n\nThe advantages of the structured mesh are the algorithms of discretization and imple-\n\nmentation in a computationally efficient manner. Their difficulties are the mesh generation\n\nof regions with multi-block shapes and the time required to produce a mesh for extremely\n\ncomplex forms in the computational domain (ANWER, 2016).\n\nThe base cell size, used for the computational domain, was 1.36 meters. For the vessel\n\nhull mesh, the isotropic prism (where the size of the cells side is equal) was used with\n\n5.3125E-3 meters (base cell size divided 256 times), equivalent to 0.39%.\n\nFor the rest of the refined regions, the anisotropic prism is used.

Source: Author.\n\n5.4.1.1 Boundary layer mesh\n\nThe boundary layer is important because the near-wall flow solution allows the deter-\n\nmination of forces and flow features that depend on the velocity gradients (CD-adapco,\n\n2014). In previous chapter it was explained how the near-all treatment works in the wall\n\nof the boundary condition and, in this study, is applied only on the hull vessel and on the\n\nwall bottom of the computational domain.\n\nSome aspects are taken into account in the generation of prism mesh. One is the\n\n\n\n65\n\nboundary thickness, and can be determined according to ITTC (2014),\n\ny =\ny+Lmod\n\nReL\n\n?\nCf\n2\n\n, (5.3)\n\nwhere Lmod is the length of the inland vessel model and ReL is the Reynolds number\n\nof the ship model. The value corresponds only to the first thickness layer and the user\n\nchooses the value of y+. For the finite mesh, y+ ? 1; and for tick mesh, 30 ? y+ ? 100,\nequivalent to logarithmic profile. In STAR-CCM+, the all y+ wall treatment is chosen\n\nby default.\n\nAnother aspect is the stretch factor, that is represented as the ratio between the\n\nthickness of a cell layer and the thickness of the preceding layer. For example, the prism\n\nlayer is 1 unit and stretch factor is 2, the thickness of the next layer is 2 units, continuing\n\nthe other next layers that would give values of 4, 8, 16 and so on. An example is illustrated\n\nin the Figure 5.14. In appendix C, an algorithm generated in MATLAB is created to\n\ndetermine the total thickness prism layer. In the Figure 5.15 and the Table 5.5 are\n\ndetailed the properties of the prism layer for the hull and wall bottom in the computational\n\ndomain. The hull stern and hull deck are not applied, and do not affect the calculation\n\nof the resistance.\n\nn1\nn2\nn3\n\nn4\n\nn5\n\nFigure 5.14: Representation of prismatic mesh for boundary layer.

First, the VOF Waves for the simula-\n\ntion of the gravity waves on a light fluid and a heavy fluid interface are defined. Provides\n\nfield functions that are used to initialize the VOF calculations (CD-adapco, 2014). In\n\nthis study, the type of VOF Waves that will be used is flat, because represents a plane\n\nof calm water. In the Table 5.6 shows the properties of VOF Waves, where the point on\n\nwater level defines the position of the water surface; the vertical direction represents the\n\nnormal vector to the water surface; current is the velocity of the heavy fluid; wind is the\n\nvelocity of the light fluid; light and heavy fluid density are required for the hydrostatic\n\nfield function, created automatically with the waves, and the values for the water and the\n\nair are determined by default. The variable u stands for the velocity which gains four\n\ndifferent values (0.576, 0.691, 0.806 and 0.921 m/s), for the calculation of the resistance,\n\nand its vector direction is negative. These configurations are visualized in the Figure 5.16.\n\nThe heavy and the light fluids corresponds to the water and the air.\n\nVariables Value\nPoint on water level (m) [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\nVertical direction [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]\nCurrent (m/s) [?u, 0.0, 0.0]\nWind (m/s) [?u, 0.0, 0.0]\nLight fluid density (kg/m3) 1.18415\nHeavy fluid density (kg/m3) 997.561\n\nTable 5.6: Properties of Flat VOF Wave on STAR-CCM+.

The velocities are defined at inlet, wall banks, top and\n\nwall bottom and correspond to field function of Flat VOF Wave. A numerical damping\n\nwith length of 8.5 m is applied at inlet and outlet planes to remove wave reflections and\n\navoid the interaction of the true wave field generated by the vessel of the model, visualized\n\nin the Figure 5.17. The prism layer on bottom wall is configured only with y+ = 30 and\n\nthe hull wall on stern and deck of the vessel is not applied.\n\nBoundary Condition Properties\nInlet Velocity inlet Normal velocity with volume fraction of water\n\nand air.

Source:\nAuthor.\n\n5.6 Solver parameters, monitoring and plotting\n\nSolver is defined by three parameters: time step, maximum iteration numbers and\n\nmaximum physical time.\n\n\n\n68\n\nTime step could be determined by the Courant number, represented by\n\nCo =\n??t\n\n?x\n(5.4)\n\nwhere ? is the velocity of the fluid, ?t is the time step and ?x is the length interval. In\n\nthis study, ?x is defined as 2.125E-2 m and ? is the minimum velocity of the vessel.\n\nThe Courant number must be less that or equal to 1. According to ITTC (2014) the\n\nequation of the time step is\n\n?t = 0.05 ? 0.01Lmod\n?\n\n. (5.5)\n\nHowever, for flows in confined water, a significantly smaller time step introduced by Liu\n\net al. (2017), which is used in this study, is represented as\n\n?t ? 0.002Lmod\n?\n\n. (5.6)\n\nThe definition of the maximum iteration number is not established. Checking the\n\njournal scientific papers, the average value of iteration is 10 per time step and is chosen\n\nin this study. The maximum physical time depends of the simulation results, where\n\nthe variable of vessel resistance could be stable. Analyzing the results, 120 seconds is\n\nenough, as shown in the Figure 5.18. The total iteration process is completed after 80,000\n\niterations.\n\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n5.5\n\n6\n\nFigure 5.18: Physical time simulation of the 2700 TDW inland vessel performed on STAR-\nCCM+ at ? = 0.576 m/s.

Initially, the variables of the residuals start with values equal to 1. During\n\nprocess, some variables drop to three levels. The ideal is that all the variables must\n\nbe in lower levels than 1 \u00b7 10?2. Therefore, the results in CFD simulation could close\nthe experimental results.

Source: Author.\n\nThe values obtained from the application of empirical methods applicable for large\n\nriver operation do not offer, in this study, an accurate prediction of the vessel resistance.\n\nThe calculation of the coefficient forces are observed in the Figure B.5, where the frictional\n\ncoefficient resistance are calculated with Reynolds number from 3.5\u00b710?3 to 1.7\u00b710?3. The\nresidual resistance coefficient with infinite velocity is calculated, and the results is constant\n\nwith 103Cr = 0.345 with length Froude number values up to 0.15. From FrL = 0.15,\n\n103Cr the values goes up to 3.5. The values of the loss in velocities (Figure B.4) using\n\nSchlichting\u2019s method are between 14.93% (?? = 0.345 m/s) and 15.50% (?? = 0.921\n\nm/s). For Lackenby\u2019s method, the loss in velocities are between 15.21% and 15.90%.\n\nIn the Figure B.6 are shown the comparison of the ship resistance, where the residuary\n\nresistance are more higher in shallow waters than in deep waters, because of various\n\nfactors like the influence of the walls (lateral and bottom), high waves resistance values\n\nand other effects.\n\n\n\n72\n\nThe values of the vessel resistance using empirical methods for medium rivers are in\n\nbetter agreement with the experimental results. The velocities ?1 and ?2 are calculated\n\nfrom Karpov\u2019s diagram (Figure B.7) and are higher than ?? (maximum of 12.5% approx-\n\nimately). In the Figure B.8 shows the coefficient forces for middle rivers. The values of\n\nthe frictional resistance coefficient are higher in comparison with this variable for large\n\nrivers. The calculation of the residuary resistance coefficient is constant with value equal\n\nto 2.54 and from FrL = 0.15 this coefficient varies until 2.85. Raven (2012) affirms that\n\nthe most used empirical methods to estimate shallow water resistance for inland vessels\n\nhave a very weak theoretical and empirical basis. He recommends the development of\n\nnew prediction methods that correct separately the components of the total resistance\n\n(LINDE et al., 2017).\n\nThe results of the numerical method are more accurate at the beginning, but the\n\nvelocity are higher and the discrepancies appear, described in the Table 5.11. The relative\n\nerror is necessary to observe the discrepancy between the approximation values and the\n\nexact values, and is represented by\n\nEr =\nFm ?FCFD\n\nFm\n(5.7)\n\nwhere Fm is the model resistance that is tested experimentally and FCFD is the resistance\n\nthat is calculated numerically.\n\nRt (N) Relative error (%)\n?(m/s) Experimental CFD Empirical CFD Empirical\n0.576 6.8941 6.9600 5.8256 -0.9563 15.4988\n0.691 11.2875 10.2000 8.5450 9.6342 24.2968\n0.806 16.7105 14.2000 12.0895 15.0236 27.6533\n0.921 25.7228 19.6000 17.8585 23.8031 30.5657\n\nTable 5.11: Comparison of numerical and empirical method with experimental results.\nSource: Author.\n\nThe Figure 5.22 shows the numerical results of the hull resistance for each velocity\n\nand the behavior is the same.

The presence of the\n\nwalls causes reflection of the waves. The wave height was measured in the longitudinal\n\ncross section outside in the hull and is illustrated in the Figure 5.35.

Source: Author.\n\n\n\n85\n\n6 CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe problem solution by CFD allows the collecting data that are difficult to obtain\n\nfrom the experimental tests, for example, the velocity distribution of the water in the\n\ncomputational domain and the streamlines around the hull. The use of CFD can realize\n\nthe corrections and improvements of the hull in the process design. This is no mean\n\nthat the experimental test could be replaced by CFD simulation despite the numerical\n\nsimulations must be faster or cost less.\n\nThe conclusions of this study could be listed as follows:\n\n? The formulations for the empirical procedure were satisfactory only in case of vessel\n\nnavigating in middle rivers in which case the most appropriate is the Karpov\u2019s and\n\nArtjushkov\u2019s method.\n\n? In the case of other methods used in barge operating in large rivers, the width of the\n\naffluent is not taken into account, implying less velocity loss. The wave resistance\n\nis not taken account instead of residuary resistance is used. Also, the formulations\n\nfor the application to this shallow water effects are not satisfied for the inland vessel\n\nhull in this study.\n\n? The results of the inland vessel resistance by numerical simulation are satisfactory\n\nonly in case of low speeds. As the speed increases, the relative error also increases\n\nup to 18%.\n\n? The GCI applied in the mesh convergence criteria allow the choosing of the number\n\nof mesh in the numerical solution. The errors are too small, and the medium grid\n\nis chosen to simulate the ship resistance and calculate its properties at different\n\nvelocities.\n\n? The calculation properties by CFD allow the inside analysis of the performance of\n\nthe inland vessel that the experimental analysis could be not measured. Is very\n\n\n\n86\n\nimportant the comparison of the numerical and the experimental results of some\n\nvariables, as example, the wetted surface of the hull.\n\nThe numerical simulation results can be corrected with more precision in order to\n\nobtain results similar to those obtained in cases of navigation in shallow waters. For\n\nthis purpose, it is important to present the future work, specifying aspects that must be\n\nanalyzed.\n\n6.1 Future analysis\n\nAll difficulties found during the development of this research could be listed as follows:\n\n? Execution of test in reduced scale of the 2700 TDW inland vessel for obtaining the\n\nanalysis as skinage and trim. Also, it must be calculating some measure variables\n\nas length of the vessel in waterline, wetted surface area, inclination angle, etc.\n\n? Improves and optimizes the inland vessel hull geometry in bow and stern based on\n\nreference as Rotteveel, Hekkenberg and Ploeg (2017) and Tabaczek and Zawi?slak\n\n(2018).\n\n? Modification of the computational domain size (at last 6.5 times of LWL of the\n\nship model in x coordinate and 1.2 times of LWL z coordinate from free surface\n\nof the water) and more elements in the grid mesh distribution (approximately 22\n\nmillion), specially on the free surface and the space between the ship hull and the\n\nwall bottom.\n\n? Apply the GCI criteria for the highest velocity imputing parameters (time step or\n\ncell size of the mesh) according to Linde et al. (2017).\n\n? Application of the propulsion analysis, where it will study the propeller design and\n\nthe power required to push the self-propelled inland vessel using CFD software with\n\nsemi-empirical approach and its validation in model scale.\n\n? Comparison of the experimental and semi-empirical approaches with others CFD\n\nsoftware as STAR-CCM+, ANSYS Fluent, OPEN Foam and Nektar++. The rela-\n\ntive error must be, at last, increase up to 5 %.\n\n? News semi-empirical formulations of the shallow waters that implies the analysis of\n\nmaneuverability, stability, hull dimensions, skinage, trim and others according to\n\nRaven (2012).\n\n\n\n87\n\nREFERENCES\n\nACOSTA-LOPERA, O.
