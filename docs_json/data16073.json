FUTURE PERSPECTIVES 185 \n\nLITERATURE CITED 187 \n\nAGRADECIMENTOS 197 \n\n\n\nSummary \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n \n\nSUMMARY \n\n \n\nOctopus vulgaris is one of the most important fishery resources in the coastal area of the \n\nAtlantic Iberian basin. One to two years lifespan, terminal semelparity with numerous eggs \n\nand the absence of generation overlap are the reasons for high variability in the species \n\nabundance between years strongly connected with environmental conditions. The overall \n\naim of this thesis is to identify which factors, physical, environmental and biologic \n\ninfluencing the Octopus vulgaris life cycle. First of all, we look at the reproductive season \n\nof the species in the northwest and south Portuguese coasts and conclude that spawning \n\ndepends on the local oceanographic regime but also partially on the nutritional quality of \n\nthe food. The study was followed by an analysis of the local factors that influence \n\nabundance in the nursery of R\u00eda de Vigo (Southwest Galicia). Here, the newly-hatched \n\nparalarvae concentrate in shallow waters and protected areas under the influence of the \n\nCies islands and feed on the meso-zooplanktonic community that supply these paralarvae \n\nwith the adequate nutritional requirements balanced to protein but also rich in n-3HUFA \n\nfatty acids essential for growth and survival at this stage. After settlement, the physical and \n\nenvironmental characteristics of the feeding grounds are essential for recruitment success. \n\nHere we identified five areas of pre-recruit aggregation along the Portuguese Coast. \n\nFinally, the age and growth were determined for juveniles of the Northwest Portuguese \n\ncoast. Age estimates are fundamental tools to chronologically follow the effect of the \n\nenvironmental factors through the life cycle. Here, ageing methodologies using the stylets \n\nas age recorders were improved to achieve precision and accuracy in ageing estimates in \n\nthis species. The results and conclusions of the thesis present important data to incorporate \n\nin the future ecosystem approach models for the assessment and management of the \n\noctopus fisheries in the Portuguese coast. \n\n \n\nKey words: Octopus vulgaris, adults, paralarvae, juvenile, reproduction, feeding \n\nrequirements, essential habitats, age, growth, stylets.  \n\n\n\nResumo \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\nRESUMO \n\n \n\nOctopus vulgaris \u00e9 um dos recursos marinhos mais capturados na \u00e1rea costeira da costa \n\nIb\u00e9rica Atl\u00e2ntica. A longevidade de um a dois anos, semelparidade com descend\u00eancia \n\nnumerosa e aus\u00eancia de sobreposi\u00e7\u00e3o de gera\u00e7\u00f5es faz com que a abund\u00e2ncia da esp\u00e9cie \n\nvarie muito de um ano para o outro em fun\u00e7\u00e3o de condi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais. O objetivo geral \n\ndesta tese \u00e9 identificar quais os fatores f\u00edsicos, ambientais e biol\u00f3gicos que condicionam o \n\nciclo de vida das popula\u00e7\u00f5es de O. vulgaris da costa continental portuguesa. Para \n\ndesenvolver esta tese observ\u00e1mos, numa primeira fase, a \u00e9poca reprodutiva das duas \n\npopula\u00e7\u00f5es da costa noroeste e sul portuguesas concluindo que esta depende do regime \n\noceanogr\u00e1fico local mas tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 parcialmente influenciada pela disponibilidade \n\nnutricional no momento. De seguida, analisaram-se os fatores locais que fazem com que a \n\nR\u00eda de Vigo (Galiza) seja \u00e1rea de ber\u00e7\u00e1rio importante para esta esp\u00e9cie. Aqui as paralarvas \n\nrec\u00e9m-eclodidas concentram-se em \u00e1guas pouco profundas do interior da ria junto \u00e0s Ilhas \n\nCies, onde se alimentam da comunidade de meso-zoopl\u00e2ncton que lhes fornece o equil\u00edbrio \n\nnutricional adequado de prote\u00ednas e l\u00edpidos e o suficiente em \u00e1cidos gordos poli-\n\ninsaturados da fam\u00edlia n-3 de que necessitam para a fase de crescimento exponencial que \n\nocorre at\u00e9 ao assentamento. Ap\u00f3s o assentamento, as caracter\u00edsticas f\u00edsicas e ambientais e \n\nlocais s\u00e3o essenciais para o sucesso do recrutamento \u00e0 pesca. Com este trabalho, \n\nidentificaram-se e caracterizaram-se cinco \u00e1reas de agrega\u00e7\u00e3o de juvenis ao longo da costa \n\nPortuguesa. Finalmente, foram abordados a idade e o crescimento. A estima\u00e7\u00e3o da idade \u00e9 \n\numa ferramenta essencial para acompanhar cronologicamente o efeito dos fatores \n\nambientais ao longo do ciclo de vida. Neste trabalho foram desenvolvidas metodologias \n\nque permitiram melhorar a precis\u00e3o e a exatid\u00e3o das estimativas diretas da idade dos \n\npolvos a partir da deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de an\u00e9is de crescimento na concha vestigial. Os resultados e \n\nconclus\u00f5es obtidos ao longo deste documento oferecem dados fundamentais para os \n\nmodelos de abordagem ecossist\u00e9mica que ser\u00e3o usados na futura avalia\u00e7\u00e3o e gest\u00e3o efetiva \n\ndo polvo-comum na costa continental portuguesa.  \n\n \n\nPalavras chave: Octopus vulgaris, adultos, paralarvas, juvenis, reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o, requisitos \n\nalimentares, habitats essenciais, idade, crescimento, bastonetes. \n\n\n\nResumo Alargado \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nRESUMO ALARGADO \n\n \n\nO polvo-comum Octopus vulgaris (Cuvier 1797) \u00e9 um dos mais importantes recursos \n\nexplorados pela frota pesqueira em Portugal e na Galiza. Com desembarques em Portugal \n\nna ordem das 7 500 toneladas (m\u00e9dia dos desembarques registados entre 1982 e 2012) dos \n\nquais 90% s\u00e3o da responsabilidade da frota artesanal e costeira, este \u00e9 o recurso que \n\npermite maior rendimento ao pescador no leil\u00e3o de primeira venda uma vez que associa \n\nfrequentemente a esp\u00e9cie com maior peso desembarcado e o valor de primeira venda mais \n\nelevado (em m\u00e9dia, no mesmo per\u00edodo, 4\u20ac/kilo). Estes dois fatores fazem com que o \n\npolvo-comum seja considerado atualmente um recurso de rendimento garantido para v\u00e1rias \n\nfrotas artesanais e de pequena escala. Este rendimento garantido n\u00e3o passa despercebido \u00e0 \n\nfrota industrial de arrasto de fundo que \u00e9 hoje em dia respons\u00e1vel por 10 % dos \n\ndesembarques totais de Polvo-comum em \u00e1guas portuguesas. Por\u00e9m, o interesse do Polvo-\n\ncomum como recurso pesqueiro \u00e9 partilhado pelas comunidades costeiras de Espanha, \n\nIt\u00e1lia e outros pa\u00edses mediterr\u00e2nicos. Em particular, a comunidade aut\u00f3noma da Galiza \u00e9 \n\nrespons\u00e1vel por desembarcar em m\u00e9dia 5, 700 ton de polvo por ano. \n\nAo n\u00edvel ecol\u00f3gico e biol\u00f3gico, O. vulgaris \u00e9 uma das esp\u00e9cies que melhor se adapta \n\na diferentes condi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais como mostra a sua extensa distribui\u00e7\u00e3o geogr\u00e1fica desde \n\no Mediterr\u00e2neo, passando pelo Atl\u00e2ntico Sul, Sul do \u00cdndico e Noroeste do Pac\u00edfico. Hoje \n\nem dia considera-se mesmo que O. vulgaris \u00e9 um complexo de esp\u00e9cies que engloba O. \n\noculifer, O. tetricus e O. insularis. A press\u00e3o evolutiva sobre a esp\u00e9cie favoreceu a redu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nda concha vestigial a dois bastonetes com fun\u00e7\u00e3o de suporte do funil, melhorando a \n\nmobilidade e passagem para \u00e1guas mais profundas, a ado\u00e7\u00e3o do estilo de vida bento-\n\npel\u00e1gico com uma recente fase paralarvar pel\u00e1gica, a estrat\u00e9gia reprodutiva de \n\nsemelparidade com a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de milhares de ovos numa \u00fanica desova terminal e prote\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nmaterna dos ovos durante o desenvolvimento embrion\u00e1rio. O. vulgaris \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m um \n\npredador do n\u00edvel superior da cadeia tr\u00f3fica que se alimenta de forma oportunistica de \n\npeixes, crust\u00e1ceos e outros moluscos. Por isto, podemos dizer que O. vulgaris se \n\nespecializou em ser um generalista. \n\nPara esp\u00e9cies como esta que combinam uma fase paralarvar pel\u00e1gica relativamente \n\nlonga com uma fase bent\u00f3nica juvenil e adulta sedent\u00e1ria (n\u00e3o s\u00e3o conhecidos padr\u00f5es \n\nmigrat\u00f3rios significativos) as condi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais que uma e outra experimentam s\u00e3o \n\nparticularmente importantes para a sobreviv\u00eancia e o sucesso do recrutamento \u00e0 pesca. \n\n\n\nResumo Alargado \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\nNeste aspeto, a costa Ib\u00e9rica Atl\u00e2ntica apresenta condi\u00e7\u00f5es ideais para avaliar como a \n\nesp\u00e9cie se adapta a diferentes ambientes. Aqui podemos encontrar dois regimes \n\noceanogr\u00e1ficos diferentes cujas caracter\u00edsticas costeiras influenciam diretamente os ciclos \n\nbiol\u00f3gicos. Na costa noroeste, a circula\u00e7\u00e3o costeira (at\u00e9 aos 200 m) \u00e9 dominada pelo \n\nSistema de afloramento costeiro Ib\u00e9rico ocidental (Western Iberian Upwelling System, \n\nWIUS). Aqui os ciclos biol\u00f3gicos da maioria das esp\u00e9cies s\u00e3o influenciados pela \n\nsazonalidade e intensidade do afloramento costeiro provocado pelo padr\u00e3o de ventos \n\npredominantes de norte da primavera e ver\u00e3o, alternando com ventos de sudoeste \n\npredominantes no Inverno que promovem uma contra circula\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua mais quente e \n\nmenos salina junto \u00e0 costa em direc\u00e7\u00e3o ao p\u00f3lo. Na costa sul, o afloramento costeiro \n\nsazonal n\u00e3o \u00e9 t\u00e3o intenso devido ao efeito sombra provocado pela orienta\u00e7\u00e3o a sul da costa, \n\nonde a circula\u00e7\u00e3o depende do padr\u00e3o de ventos este-oeste. Aqui os ciclos biol\u00f3gicos est\u00e3o \n\nsincronizados com a \u00e9poca de maior temperatura da \u00e1gua do mar e com os regimes de \n\ninput de nutrientes provenientes das bacias hidrogr\u00e1ficas do Guadiana e do Guadalquivir e \n\na sua \u00e1rea de influ\u00eancia que depende da orografia local.  \n\nEsta tese desenvolve-se em cinco cap\u00edtulos de forma a explicar o condicionamento \n\ndas condi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais sobre o ciclo do O. vulgaris, focando-se no ciclo reprodutivo da \n\nesp\u00e9cie nas duas \u00e1reas da costa continental portuguesa que apresentam condi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\noceanogr\u00e1ficas diferentes; nas caracter\u00edsticas f\u00edsicas, ambientais e nutricionais que habitats \n\nreconhecidos como importantes ber\u00e7\u00e1rios ou \u00e1reas de alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o apresentam e que fazem \n\ndeles habitats essenciais (Essential Fish Habitats, EFH) e no desenvolvimento de \n\nferramentas de estima\u00e7\u00e3o da idade e do crescimento da esp\u00e9cie. O cap\u00edtulo 1 faz o \n\nenquadramento da tese no que diz respeito \u00e0 explora\u00e7\u00e3o do recurso no mundo e em \n\nespecial em Espanha e Portugal, sobre os eventos evolutivos relevantes para a plasticidade \n\nambiental da esp\u00e9cies, sobre as caracter\u00edsticas e regime oceanogr\u00e1fico da \u00e1rea costeira \n\nmenos profunda (&lt;200 m) da costa Ib\u00e9rica Atl\u00e2ntica e por \u00faltimo sobre a metodologia \n\nescolhida para estudar o ciclo de vida da esp\u00e9cie.  \n\nNo cap\u00edtulo dois s\u00e3o analisados os ciclos de reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o de duas popula\u00e7\u00f5es da costa \n\ncontinental portuguesa e que est\u00e3o sujeitas aos dois regimes oceanogr\u00e1ficos da costa \n\ncontinental portuguesa. Inicialmente foi estudada uma s\u00e9rie temporal de dados biol\u00f3gicos \n\nde peso, sexo, estado de matura\u00e7\u00e3o e \u00edndice gonadossom\u00e1tico que permitiu concluir que \n\napesar das \u00e9pocas em que podemos encontrar mais indiv\u00edduos em estado reprodutivo serem \n\ncoincidentes no Ver\u00e3o, na costa noroeste a \u00e9poca reprodutiva prolonga-se por toda a \n\n\n\nResumo Alargado \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nPrimavera e Ver\u00e3o e coincide com o afloramento costeiro sazonal; enquanto que na costa \n\nsul, a \u00e9poca reprodutiva (a \u00e9poca com a maior propor\u00e7\u00e3o de indiv\u00edduos maduros) ocorre no \n\nfim do Ver\u00e3o em Agosto/Setembro e coincide com a \u00e9poca do ano em que temperatura da \n\n\u00e1gua do mar atinge o seu valor m\u00e1ximo. Conhecendo esta diferen\u00e7a espacial da \u00e9poca de \n\nreprodu\u00e7\u00e3o e sabendo que \u00e0 partida podemos encontrar indiv\u00edduos maduros ao longo de \n\ntodo ano, investigou-se se as condi\u00e7\u00f5es nutricionais encontradas fora e durante a \u00e9poca \n\nreprodutiva variam e se esta varia\u00e7\u00e3o poderia afectar a condi\u00e7\u00e3o nutricional dos ovos. \n\nAnalisaram-se classes de l\u00edpidos e \u00e1cidos gordos na gl\u00e2ndula digestiva e nas g\u00f3nadas de \n\nf\u00eameas imaturas e maduras das duas \u00e1reas de estudo. Os resultados mostram que apesar de \n\nexistirem diferen\u00e7as significativas na qualidade da alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o que o polvo encontra numa \n\ne noutra costa, estas diferen\u00e7as n\u00e3o afectam a qualidade dos ovos, indicando que os \n\nfactores que despoletam a reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o fundamentalmente intr\u00ednsecos ao organismo e \n\nn\u00e3o \u00e0 quantidade ou qualidade do alimento encontrado. \n\nO cap\u00edtulo tr\u00eas lida com os fatores e \u00e1reas que potenciam a sobreviv\u00eancia de \n\nparalarvas e juvenis. Numa esp\u00e9cie cujos adultos t\u00eam poucos predadores (o seu maior \n\npredador \u00e9 o homem) e que s\u00e3o bastante resistentes \u00e0s condi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais adversas, a \n\nmaior parte da press\u00e3o sobre os indiv\u00edduos ocorre antes (na fase de paralarva) e durante o \n\nassentamento (quando chegam a sub adulto). A R\u00eda de Vigo \u00e9 protegida na sua embocadura \n\npelas Ilhas Ci\u00e9s que funcionam como barreira \u00e0 ondula\u00e7\u00e3o de oeste e sudoeste, \n\npredominante na costa nordeste Atl\u00e2ntica e formam a fronteira exterior da R\u00eda de Vigo. \n\nAqui, monitoriza-se regularmente a comunidade de zooplancton da R\u00eda em transectos \n\nlongitudinais \u00e0s Ilhas Cies localizados a oeste (fora da R\u00eda) e a este destas (dentro da R\u00eda). \n\nOs resultados mostram que as maiores abund\u00e2ncias de zooplankton se correlacionam com \n\nas \u00e1reas de menor profundidade e mais pr\u00f3ximas das ilhas. Estas condi\u00e7\u00f5es facilitam a \n\nan\u00e1lise do teor nutricional das potenciais presas das paralarvas nesta \u00e1rea de ber\u00e7\u00e1rio e \n\ncomo o perfil nutricional varia entre presas e predadores.

O cap\u00edtulo tr\u00eas descreve ainda as \u00e1reas de alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o e crescimento \n\n\n\nResumo Alargado \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\ndos juvenis. Aqui, definiram-se ao longo da costa portuguesa 8 \u00e1reas de maior abund\u00e2ncia \n\nde pr\u00e9-recrutas. Estas \u00e1reas localizam-se em zonas de pouca profundidade \n\n(aproximadamente 80 m) sob a influ\u00eancia dos grandes estu\u00e1rios onde a abund\u00e2ncia de \n\npotenciais presas \u00e9 maior. Este estudo permitiu tamb\u00e9m concluir que as condi\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\nsalinidade local s\u00e3o muito mais determinantes para a agrega\u00e7\u00e3o dos juvenis do que a \n\ntemperatura local. \n\nO cap\u00edtulo quatro lida com o desenvolvimento de metodologias de estima\u00e7\u00e3o direta \n\nde idades que permitam a estima\u00e7\u00e3o mais precisa e exacta da idade individualmente. A \n\nmaioria dos modelos de avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de mananciais de pesca requer a inclus\u00e3o de informa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nrelativa \u00e0 estrutura et\u00e1ria das popula\u00e7\u00f5es exploradas. Por\u00e9m, a impossibilidade de observar \n\nincrementos de crescimento di\u00e1rio nos estat\u00f3litos, a eros\u00e3o a que as mand\u00edbulas est\u00e3o \n\nsujeitas ao longo da vida, e a fragilidade da estrutura do bastonete (concha vestigial) que \n\nimpossibilitava o uso das t\u00e9cnicas abrasivas de corte e polimento e a reprodutibilidade das \n\nobserva\u00e7\u00f5es t\u00eam sido obst\u00e1culos dif\u00edceis de ultrapassar. S\u00f3 recentemente, com a inclus\u00e3o \n\ndos cortes de bastonetes em resina acr\u00edlica, que preserva a estrutura interna dos bastonetes, \n\nfoi poss\u00edvel melhorar a t\u00e9cnica da estima\u00e7\u00e3o de idades usando esta estrutura. Com este \n\ntrabalho analis\u00e1mos a estrutura dos bastonetes em paralarvas e juvenis, de forma a medir e \n\nvalidar marcas de crescimento determinantes como a marca de desova. Para validar a \n\nmarca de desova, observaram-se e mediram-se bastonetes de paralarvas com 1 e 3 dias de \n\nidade e paralarvas capturadas no meio selvagem com menos de 10 dias. Foi poss\u00edvel \n\nobservar que na desova, e logo ap\u00f3s a mesma, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel distinguir uma zona nuclear de 5 \n\n\u00b5m de di\u00e2metro e cuja dimens\u00e3o \u00e9 conservativa em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 dimens\u00e3o da paralarva e da \n\nconcha vestigial. A defini\u00e7\u00e3o desta regi\u00e3o foi essencial para o passo seguinte de estima\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde idades em sub adultos p\u00f3s assentamento. O uso de t\u00e9cnicas de corte dos bastonetes \n\nid\u00eantico aos m\u00e9todos de corte de ot\u00f3litos para a observa\u00e7\u00e3o da microestrutura foi essencial \n\npara identificar pela primeira vez a \u00e1rea nuclear e pela primeira vez fazer uma estimativa \n\ndirecta da idade de juvenis e estimar o tempo que estes demoram a atingir o tamanho \n\nm\u00ednimo de captura, aproximadamente oito meses. Assim como para outras esp\u00e9cies do \n\ng\u00e9nero Octopus, o exerc\u00edcio de observa\u00e7\u00e3o da microestrutura de crescimento e estima\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde taxas de crescimento permitiu mais uma vez confirmar que a varia\u00e7\u00e3o individual das \n\ntaxas de crescimento \u00e9 elevada, o que torna dif\u00edcil definir um modelo de crescimento que \n\nrepresente o crescimento da esp\u00e9cie ou de determinada popula\u00e7\u00e3o. \u00c9 cr\u00edtico neste caso, \n\ncomo se demostrou ao longo de toda a tese, que o ciclo de vida e a ecologia do O. vulgaris \n\n\n\nResumo Alargado \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\nseja muito dependente das condi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais f\u00edsicas e biol\u00f3gicas locais, sendo \n\nimportante que qualquer modelo de explora\u00e7\u00e3o que se venha a aplicar a esta esp\u00e9cie, \n\nintegre e par\u00e2metros ambientais, para que possamos prever a abund\u00e2ncia, a disponibilidade \n\ndo recurso e mesmo a quantidade de biomassa que se pode retirar em cada ano das \n\npopula\u00e7\u00f5es residentes para que o recurso possa ser explorado de forma sustent\u00e1vel. \n\nO cap\u00edtulo cinco apresenta e engloba os resultados e conclus\u00f5es obtidas no contexto \n\ndo conhecimento mais recente que se tem da biologia e ecologia da esp\u00e9cie O. vulgaris. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nList of papers \n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\nLIST OF PAPERS \n\n \n\nThis thesis comprises the papers listed below.

General introduction \n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\n \n\n1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION \n\n1.1. OCTOPUS FISHERIES \n \n\nCephalopods world catches have been increasing constantly during the last 40 years \n\n(Norman et al., 2014). This growing interest on cephalopods is related with the decline of \n\nthe finfish catches and the perception of cephalopods as alternative protein sources for \n\nhuman consumption (Jereb et al. 2014). In this group, the octopuses (most belonging to the \n\nfamily Octopodidae) play an important role as a resource exploited by the small-scale \n\nfishing communities spread along the coastal areas, but and also by some industrial fleets \n\n(Fonseca et al., 2008). Since the 1950's, the official statistics have been showing a global \n\nincrease in octopus annual catches (FAO, 2011-2014). The Food and Agriculture \n\nOrganization (FAO) estimated that between 2002 and 2012 an average 334 033 ton/year of \n\noctopuses were captured worldwide with an increasing tendency (FAO, 2011-2014). \n\nDespite that, since 2009 octopus landings have been decreasing, with 2012 registering \n\nannual global landings of 316 582 ton (Figure 1.1). A major problem is that only a few \n\ncountries discriminate octopus catches by species, and the relative importance of the \n\ncommon octopus Octopus vulgaris is therefore unknown. Nevertheless due to its \n\ncommercial value, it should be expected that the octopus landings from the eastern Atlantic \n\nand Mediterranean waters are dominated by O. vulgaris (Pierce et al., 2010). \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1\u2013 Evolution of the worldwide annual landings of the octopus species group between 1980 and \n\n2012. The lines indicate the landings tendency by decade. The 2000's decade comprises the years between \n\n2000 and 2012 (data source: FAO, 2014). \n\n \n\n\n\n1. General introduction \n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\nIn Europe, O. vulgaris is the most important exploited octopus species (ICES, 2012a; \n\nTsangridis et al., 2002), the Italian, Spanish and Portuguese fleets being the most important \n\ncontributors to the total catch (Pierce et al., 2010). In the Iberian Peninsula, O. vulgaris \n\nreached an average 18 639 ton/year in the last 30 years, 6 % of the worldwide octopus \n\nlandings in the same period. Here, the general tendency of the last 32 years (1982-2012) \n\nshow that in Portugal O. vulgaris landings have been increasing, and Spanish \n\nMediterranean and Northeast Atlantic catches have been decreasing both at approximately \n\nthe same rate (Figure 1.2).  \n\nIt is worth of note that the O. vulgaris catches can vary by more than 50% between \n\nconsecutive years. Between 2008 and 2009 for instances, octopus landings of the \n\nPortuguese fleet decreased by 48% in landed weight, increasing by 36 % in 2010 (Figure \n\n1.2; INE, 2014). The O. vulgaris life cycle characteristics, such as the short lifespan, the \n\nsemelparity, and the lack of stock-recruitment relationship makes to be virtual impossible \n\nto predict fisheries outcomes from a year to another (Pita et al., in prep).  \n\nIn Portugal, O. vulgaris is captured mainly with pots and traps (around 90%) (ICES, \n\n2012a) by the \u201clocal fleet\u201d (small-size boats, the majority of which do not exceed 9 m in \n\ntotal length) and the \u201ccoastal fleet\u201d (comprised of vessels generally ranging from 9-15 m in \n\ntotal length). The multi-specific trawling fleet is responsible for the other 10% of catches \n\nwith an increasing tendency (Fonseca et al., 2008; Pilar-Fonseca et al., 2014). The \n\ntraditional small-scale fishery targeting O. vulgaris in the northeast Spanish waters is \n\nidentical to the Portuguese fleet (Freire &amp; Garc??a-Allut, 2000). As in Portugal, the \n\nNortheast Spanish fleet is markedly local, multi-gear and multi-specific with an important \n\neconomic and social role in the coastal fisher communities (Freire &amp; Garc??a-Allut, 2000; \n\nOtero et al., 2005). Nevertheless, the two neighboring areas seem to present distinct \n\nexploitation patterns, with the northeast Spanish catches being stable or slightly decreasing \n\nin the last 32 years, probably an influence of the fishing moratorium due to the Prestige oil \n\nspill, and the Portuguese catches still increasing (Figure 1.2). Another important aspect, is \n\nthe fact that the northeast Spanish O. vulgaris catches present a marked seasonality (Otero \n\net al., 2005), which is only comparable in Portugal to the octopus landings pattern found in \n\ncephalopod targeting  trawls (Fonseca et al., 2008).  \n\n\n\n1. General introduction \n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 \u2013 Evolution of the octopus annual catches in the Iberian Peninsula. Annual landings data are \n\ndiscriminated by geographical area (Mediterranean and Northeast Atlantic) and by landing country (Sources: \n\nINE 2013; FAO, 2014). \n\nIn Portugal and despite the unpredictable variability in the stock availability, O. \n\nvulgaris is the most important target species in the entire Portuguese fisheries in terms of \n\neconomic value, when all official and non-declared landings are considered (Pilar-Fonseca \n\net al., 2014) with evidences that the species\u2019 catches play an important role as guaranty \n\nrevenue species to the non-targeting octopus fisheries. In fact, O. vulgaris has long been an \n\nimportant target species for artisanal fishers and, nowadays, it is an increasingly important \n\nfishery resource in terms of quantities landed and particularly in terms of commercial \n\nvalue. O. vulgaris is frequently the species with higher value in first sale auction (mean \n\nprice of \u20ac4/kg) and, for instance in 2012, its official catches represented 14% (\u20ac38.7 \n\nmillion) of the official first sale revenue of all Portuguese fisheries, second only to sardines \n\n(INE, 2014).  \n\nThe increasing dependence of the Portuguese small-scale and trawling fisheries of \n\nthe O. vulgaris stock (Fonseca et al., 2008; Pilar-Fonseca et al., 2014) associated to the \n\nunpredictable variation in availability of the resource have, from time to time, lead to \n\nimportant pressure actions of fishers on governmental bodies, demanding protective \n\nmeasures. These fisher actions have, almost without exemption, lead to changes in the \n\nmanagement rules that regulate fishing activity.  This was the case in 1996, when fishers\u2019 \n\nworries about the risk of overexploitation of octopus brought them together to request \n\nprotective measures for octopus, which resulted in the implementation of new legislation \n\n(Portaria n\u00ba 27/2001), and again in 2010, when a \u201cbad\u201d fishing year drove fishers\u2019 action to \n\nchange the legislation (Portaria n\u00ba 230/2012) (Pita et al., in prep).   \n\n\n\n1. General introduction \n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\nTargeting small-scale fishery conducted with \u201cshelter traps\u201d (pots) (Pereira, 1999) targets \n\nthe mature individuals of higher outcome (individual weight c.a. 1100 g, Pereira pers. \n\ncomm), with virtually no by-catches or discards and minimum environmental damage. \n\nThese characteristics elect the Portuguese octopus small-scale fishery as a good candidate \n\nfor environmentally sustainable fisheries eco-labelling schemes (Matias, 2013). Although \n\nproblems associated with the unpredictability of stock availability to fisheries, illegal and \n\nunreported catches, high auction first sale value and the lack of the formal producers \n\norganizations can be identified as constrains to the adoption of the eco-labelling. \n\n \n\n1.2. EVOLUTION AND GENETICS  \n\nAll modern cephalopods including the squids, cuttlefishes and octopuses, belong to \n\nthe subclass Coleoidea (Boyle &amp; Rodhouse, 2006; Kr\u00f6ger et al., 2011). Fossil records and \n\nmolecular studies show that the Coleoidea evolved along with their sister group, the \n\nNautiloidea, in the late Paleozoic, 276 Ma ago (Kr\u00f6ger et al., 2011) when in competition \n\nwith modern fish, they apparently occupied the deep waters. The adaptation to this high \n\npressure environment leaded to the progressive internalization of shell, trading the \n\nbuoyancy for speed and the possibility of occupying the bentho-pelagic habitat (Kr\u00f6ger et \n\nal., 2011; Young et al., 1998).  \n\nWith the loss of shell and its shield function, the modern cephalopods gain the ability \n\nto swim. Consequently, the exploration of larger areas demands for more energy and to \n\nfulfill the higher metabolic rates, the respiratory and circulation system evolved for \n\ncapillary circulation with two branchial hearts located at the base of each gill to enhance \n\ncirculation within a single pair of gills and a systemic heart. The more efficient ventilation \n\nof the gills allowed producing a more elaborate musculature in the mantle cavity leading to \n\nthe evolution of the primitive expulsion chamber for jet propulsion (Boyle &amp; Rodhouse, \n\n2006). Swimming faster and becoming more maneuverable, the cephalopods also \n\ndeveloped more sophisticated sensory systems, especially eyes and large brains (Nixon &amp; \n\nYoung, 2003).    \n\nAlong with the internalization and reduction of shell, the adaptation to carnivory is \n\nalso a unique event to all coleoids (Boyle &amp; Rodhouse, 2006). The development of the \n\nbeak during embryologic development in both the Teuthidae and Octopodidae supports this \n\nearly adaptation in the feeding behavior (Franco-Santos &amp; Vidal, 2014; Franco-Santos et \n\n\n\n1. General introduction \n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\nal., 2014). In fact, at hatch the beaks are fully developed only growing and hardening as \n\nindividuals grow (Franco-Santos &amp; Vidal, 2014; Franco-Santos et al., 2014).  \n\nWith the adaption to the pelagic realm, the coleoids evolved in two distinct groups, \n\nthe ten-armed, Decabrachia and the eight-armed Vampyropoda. The latter group comprises \n\nthe Octopodidae as well as the vampire squids (Vampyroteuthidae), that in fact have ten \n\narms, but two arms are reduced sensory filaments (Kr\u00f6ger et al., 2011).    \n\nThe first modern octopuses appeared in fossil deposits of the late Cretaceous. The \n\nevolution of Vampyromorpha and Octopoda as sister groups shows a trend towards the \n\nreduction of the gladius. The modern fin supports of the Octopoda Cirrata, and the stylet-\n\nlike shell vestiges of the Octopoda Incirrata, are considered to represent the remains of a \n\nteudopseid gladius (one of the three gladius morphotypes, Fuchs &amp; Weis, 2010) (see \n\nBizikov, 2004, for a review on stylet morphology, functional role and evolution of the \n\nVampyropoda). The reduction of gladius was most probably accompanied by a shift in the \n\nlocomotion mode. Some octopus of the modern Octopoda Incirrata had completely lost the \n\nability to secrete organic shells resulting in a loss of attachment sites for fins. This radical \n\nshell reduction results in the increasing of extraordinary body plasticity (Kr\u00f6ger et al., \n\n2011).    \n\nDuring its evolutionary pathway, the modern coleoids adopted a fast growing and \n\nrelatively short lifespan and reproduced once pattern called semelparity (Rocha et al., \n\n2001; Boyle &amp; Rodhouse, 2006). The modern benthic octopuses (Octopoda, Incirrata) \n\nshow two reproductive strategies. The holobenthic strategy, where the benthic adults \n\nproduce few and large eggs resulting in well-developed benthic hatchlings (Villanueva &amp; \n\nNorman, 2008) and a merobenthic strategy, where benthic adults produce batches of \n\nnumerous small eggs (c.a. 350 000 eggs for Octopus vulgaris Mangold, 1983) hatching \n\ninto free-swimming planktonic paralarvae (Villanueva &amp; Norman, 2008) showing different \n\nstrategies to the adaptation to the benthopelagic environment (Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez et al., 2014). \n\nMolecular studies show that in their adaption to the benthopelagic environment, the first \n\noctopuses would all have a planktonic paralarval phase and the holobenthic strategy \n\nevolved afterwards as a specialization (Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez et al., 2014). \n\nThe existence of a paralarval stage during the modern cephalopods life cycle is also a \n\ndistinctive characteristic of this taxon. The term paralarva comes of the fact that those \n\ncannot be considered as a true larval stage as no truly metamorphic changes occur during \n\n\n\n1. General introduction \n\n \n\n22 \n\n \n\nthe transition between paralarva and juvenile (or sub-adult as defined in Robin et al., 2014) \n\nand in some cases, as the in the sepiids, the hatchlings already resemble their parents. \n\nNevertheless, the transition phase from hatchling or paralarvae to sub adult implies \n\nconsiderable physiologic, morphometric, allometric and habitat changes (with different \n\ndegrees depending of the cephalopods families) supports the definition of a paralarva life \n\nstage between hatch and the adoption of the adult life characteristics (Young &amp; Harman, \n\n1988; Robin et al., 2014).        \n\nThe study conducted by Ib\u00e1nez et al. (2004) supports the theory that successful \n\ncolonization by the octopuses depend of the dispersal of the paralarva. The holobenthic \n\noctopuses are common in deep and cold waters while merobenthic octopuses are common \n\nin temperate and warm waters. And while in temperate and warm waters, shifts between \n\nstrategies seem occurred through time, the deep and cold waters species all evolved into \n\nthe holobenthic strategy the octopus. This differentiation of strategies seems to be related \n\nwith environmental stability. In low temperature and low environment stochasticity as the \n\ndeep-sea and polar environments, to survive the octopuses produce few large eggs and \n\nwell-developed benthic hatchlings that improved the chance of survival and reproduction \n\nin the same benthic area. In high temperature and high environmental stochasticity, as the \n\ntropical and temperate habitats, to stay alive the octopuses produce numerous small eggs \n\nwith free-swimming planktonic paralarvae that improved the chance of survival and \n\nreproduction using the transient opportunities of the environment between benthic and \n\npelagic (Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez et al., 2014).  \n\nThe Octopus vulgaris benthopelagic life cycle strategy most certainly explains its \n\nwide distribution and the existence of several cryptic species associated to the O. vulgaris \n\nspecies complex. This species group is composed by O. vulgaris sensu strictu (or sensu \n\nCuvier, 1797) and several crypt species. In their study, Guzik et al. (2005) suggested to \n\ninclude O. oculifer from Galapagos, O. cf. tetricus from Western Australia, and O. tetricus \n\nfrom New South Wales in the species complex. Accordingly to Leite et al. (2008), this \n\ngroup also may contain the O. insularis in tropical western Atlantic. The wide range and \n\nnumber of cryptic species highlights\u2019 the evidence that the genus Octopus is polyphyletic \n\n(Guerra et al., 2010). These recent findings on the species diversity and dispersion within \n\nthe O. vulgaris species complex would suppose a reduction of the geographic range of O. \n\nvulgaris s. str. Nevertheless, the studies conducted by Warnke et al.(2004) and Guerra et al. \n\n(2010) showed evidences that O. vulgaris s. str. is monophyletic but also show evidences \n\n\n\n1. General introduction \n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\nof its wide distribution. The samples collected show that O. vulgaris s. str. can be found in \n\ncoastal waters as distant as the North-eastern Atlantic waters can be from the Southern \n\nIndian Ocean or from North-western Pacific. Thus, the known distribution area of O. \n\nvulgaris s. str. is the Mediterranean Sea, the eastern Atlantic (from southern England to \n\nsouth-western Africa), the Azores, the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, St Helena, the Tristan \n\nda Cunha Islands, the southeast coast of South Africa in the Indian Ocean, and the north-\n\nwestern Pacific, namely the waters of Taiwan and Japan (Warnke et al., 2004). \n\n \n\n1.3. BIOGEOGRAPHIC CONTEXT OF THE STUDY AREA  \n\nTo meroplanktonic organisms like O. vulgaris, that in their life cycle combine a \n\nplanktonic paralarval stage relatively long with a benthic juvenile and adult phase with \n\nnon-significant migratory patterns (Robin et al., 2014), the oceanographic patterns and \n\ncoastal topography play an important role in the survival and recruitment success of each \n\ngeneration (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2005; Otero et al., 2008; 2009; Roura et al., 2013). Moreover, \n\nin cases as this one where the recruitment to fisheries is independent of previous generation \n\nstock size but dependent of the local environmental conditions, it is worthwhile to look in \n\ndetail to the regional oceanographic features that influenced the life cycle of O. vulgaris in \n\nthe study area.    \n\nThe Iberian Atlantic basin includes the western coast of Portugal and Spain. \n\nConsidering the Estremadura Promontory (EP, 39\u00baN), the S\u00e3o Vicente Cape (CSV, 37\u00ba1\u2019N; \n\n8\u00b059\u2019W) and Sta Maria Cape (CSM, 36\u00b057\u2019N; 7\u00b053\u2019W) as references, the continental shelf \n\nis relatively wide (50 \u2013 60 km) with several canyons (e.g the Nazar\u00e9 and the Aveiro \n\ncanyon) and a steep slope northern to the EP. Here the freshwater contribution is \n\nsignificant due to the river runoff from the Tagus, Douro and Minho but also from other \n\nsmaller rivers, lagoons and inlets in its northern limits (the R\u00edas) (Peliz et al., 2005). South \n\nto the EP, the continental shelf is narrower (~25 km) with a moderate slope with no \n\nsignificant freshwater input (Peliz et al., 2005). The CSV marks the transition of the \n\ncoastline orientation from west to south, here the Portuguese and Spanish south coast\u2019s \n\nlimit the northern boundary of the Gulf of Cadiz (GoC), the large bight that encloses the \n\ntransition between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Between the CSV and the CSM, the \n\nshelf is narrow (~25 km wide), and east to the CSM it starts to widening till 40 km wide in \n\nthe Spanish coast of the Gulf of C\u00e1diz. East to the CSM, the continental shelf receives \n\n\n\n1. General introduction \n\n \n\n24 \n\n \n\nimportant freshwater inputs from the Guadiana, Tinto, Odiel and Guadalquivir rivers (Pires \n\net al., 2013).  \n\nThe entire Iberian Atlantic coast is under the influence of the Canary Current \n\nupwelling system, one of the four major eastern boundary upwelling systems (Ar\u00edstegui et \n\nal., 2009) and comprises two sub-regional systems: The Western Iberia Upwelling System \n\n(WIUS) and the Gulf of Cadiz System (GCS) (Peliz et al., 2005; Ar\u00edstegui et al., 2009) \n\nwhere the mesoscale oceanographic processes are major factors controlling the ecosystem \n\nfunctioning in those regions (Relvas et al., 2007). \n\nThe WIUS is a highly dynamic and productive system with marked seasonality that \n\nsupports a complex food web (Bode et al., 2004). The predominantly equatorward winds \n\nobserved in summer off West Iberia, drive an offshore Ekman transport and force the \n\nupwelling of colder, nutrient-rich, sub-surface waters along the coast (Relvas et al., 2007). \n\nHere, during the late spring and summer, a narrow band of cold water of relatively uniform \n\nwidth is observed along the coast and small scale (20-30 km) perturbations are usually seen \n\nalong the thermal front. This cold front is responsible for the formation of major filament \n\nstructures than can extend more than 200 km offshore (Relvas et al., 2007). Those \n\nfilaments can spread through the CSV to the east and influence the continental shelf \n\ncirculation in the area between the CSV cape and the CSM. The filaments are responsible \n\nfor exporting the new production offshore, although evidences show that the new \n\nproduction can be recirculated back in time scales of one month with interesting \n\nimplications for the retention of fish larvae near shore (Relvas et al., 2007).  During winter, \n\nthe Iberian Poleward Current (IPC) associated with the wind stress of south-westerly \n\norientation dominates the WIUS system. The IPC increases its flow in September-October \n\nand persist in intensity till April. Nevertheless its influence do not reach the inner shelf, \n\nhere the most important mechanism of forcing the shelf circulation is the wind stress. The \n\nprevailing winds in the west coast of Iberian Peninsula during winter are mainly south-\n\nwesterlies, and the atmospheric circulation is dominated by the eastward displacement of \n\ncyclonic perturbations and their associated frontal systems (Relvas et al., 2007). Several \n\nrivers drain in the west coast of the Iberian Basin, the contributions of the Tagus, \n\nMondego, Douro and Minho, and the Galician r\u00edas feed the Western Iberian Buoyant \n\nPlume (WIBP). The WIBP is characterized by low salinities and is identified in winter sea \n\nsurface temperature satellite imagery from its low temperature compared to the shelf \n\nwaters and during summer the plume waters are warmer than surrounding waters. It \n\n\n\n1. General introduction \n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\nreaches its higher intensity during winter conditions when prevailing south-westerly winds \n\ngenerate an onshore Ekman component of transport, convergent to the coast and hence a \n\nsaline front and the plume develops into a narrow (5\u201310 km) coastal current with strong \n\npoleward velocities (Relvas et al., 2007). Sardine and other fish larvae are distributed \n\nvertically in the upper 20 m, associated with the WIBP water (Santos et al., 2006). The \n\nsurface stratification in the WIBP favours the optimal conditions for phytoplankton \n\ndevelopment (Ribeiro et al., 2005) and the development of high zooplankton biomass. \n\nFigure 1.3 shows the seasonality of both the Sea Surface Temperatures (SST) and the \n\nwinds patterns in the northwest Portuguese coast based in data collected between January \n\n2000 and December 2009. \n\n \n\nFigure 1.3 - Monthly mean Sea Surface Temperature (sst), East-West component of Ekman transport \n\n(ekmanx) and north-south wind stress component (north_south_swind) obtained from the SST and wind time \n\nseries registered along the Portuguese coast under the influence of the WIUS. The mean monthly SST and \n\nekmanx were obtained from the data registered in two points along the Portuguese coast between January \n\n2000 and December 2009 (Source: NOAA ERDDAP database). \n\nThe south Portuguese coast is under the influenced by the Gulf of C\u00e1diz System \n\n(GCS). The GCS can be defined as a sub- system embedded in the large-scale Canary \n\nCurrent upwelling system (Ar\u00edstegui et al., 2009) and its dynamic is highly influenced by \n\nthis larger system. There are, however, two distinctive features that separates the GCS of \n\nthe neighbors sub-systems: the coast orientation shift from north-south to west-east and the \n\npresence of the Strait of Gibraltar as the door to the Mediterranean. Here, the water masses \n\nexchange between the Atlantic and Mediterranean influences the large-scale circulation in \n\nthe region. The meso-scale and inner-shelf circulation patterns are most influenced by the \n\nupwelling off CSV and the cold-water upwelling filaments from the eastern boundary, the \n\nrunoff from the Guadiana and Guadalquivir rivers mouth, the coastal counter-current, and \n\n\n\n1. General introduction \n\n \n\n26 \n\n \n\nthe east and west wind dynamic. The interaction between those oceanic processes and the \n\ncoast topography results in distinct circulation patterns east and west of the CSM (Garc\u00eda-\n\nLafuente &amp; Ruiz, 2007) that influences the biological processes in the area. As in the \n\nwestern coast, the circulation is influenced by the seasonality of winds pattern and \n\nupwelling/downwelling events (S\u00e1nchez et al., 2006) (Figure 1.4). During the spring-\n\nsummer upwelling, the dominant westerlies winds resulted of a prevailing positive z-\n\ncomponent of the wind curl in the zone of the CSV create conditions to bring cold and \n\nnutrient rich water to east of CSM and producing a cell over the western shelf associated \n\nwith the upwelling off CSV. Nevertheless, this cell is not strong enough to influence the \n\ncirculation and bring biological material eastward. During downwelling relaxation events, \n\nthe easterlies are stronger and the coastal counter-current flows beyond CSM and invades \n\nthe western shelf, providing transport of biological material from the east to the west and \n\nthe biological connection between both shelves. During winter, the east-west counter-\n\ncurrent and the east circulation cell are responsible for the introduction in the system of \n\nnutrient rich water from the Guadalquivir basin (Garc\u00eda-Lafuente &amp; Ruiz, 2006).   \n\nDespite the strong seasonality present in SST and wind pattern profiles (Ekman\u2019s \n\ntransport and west-east wind stress component) (Figure 1.4), the upwelling/downwelling \n\nstrength is not as intense as in the northwest coast. The water column stratification is also \n\nresponsible by the higher temperatures attained in the end of summer in the coast oriented \n\nto south.  \n\nBoth in the WIUS and the GCS, the retention and advection processes play the most \n\nimportant role in the control of the biological processes (Catal\u00e1n et al., 2006). And this \n\nadvection and retention processes are related with the seasonality of the wind patterns and \n\nupwelling/downwelling processes. In the WIUS, the seasonality of the \n\nupwelling/downwelling processes sets the pace of the biological cycles. Here, the duality \n\nbetween the offshore transport of the upwelling filaments and the retention processes \n\nassociated to the IPC and the westerly winter winds mark the seasonality of the biological \n\ncycles (Ar\u00edstegui et al., 2009) and sets the west coast of the Iberian Atlantic basin as the \n\nmain spawning and recruitment areas for sardine (Sardine pilchardus, Bernal et al., 2007; \n\nSilva et al., 2009), horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus, Murta et al., 2008) and for the \n\nmarine invertebrates (Marta-Almeida et al., 2006; dos Santos et al., 2008).   \n\n \n\n\n\n1. General introduction \n\n \n\n27 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.4 - Monthly mean Sea Surface Temperature (SST), East-West component of Ekman transport \n\n(ekmanx) and East-west wind stress component  (east_west_swind) obtained from the SST and wind time \n\nseries registered along the Portuguese coast under the influence of the GCS. The mean monthly SST and \n\nekmanx were obtained from the data registered in two points along the Portuguese coast between January \n\n2000 and December 2009 (Source: NOAA ERDDAP database). \n\n \n\nIn the GCS, the coastal orientation has a shadow effect in the upwelling conditions \n\ncreated by the prevalent northerly winds, and is the east-west wind pattern that controls the \n\nstrength and influence of the two circulation cells east and west of the CSM. Here the \n\nbiological cycles adapt to this east-west alternation. For instances, the anchovy Engraulis \n\nencrasicolus population in the northeastern area of the Gulf of C\u00e1diz synchronizes its \n\nspawning cycle with summer to benefit of the warmer and rich waters and trophic regimes \n\nmore suitable for the survival of the early stages in winter along the eastern basin (Ruiz et \n\nal., 2006). As in the northwest coast, here the advective and retention processes are \n\nessential to explain not only the larval distribution and abundance as well as the survival of \n\nearly life stages (Catal\u00e1n et al., 2006; Pires et al., 2013). For instances, decapod crustacean \n\nlarvae distribution and survival is closely related with the circulation processes and \n\nalternation along the south Portuguese coast under the GCS (Pires et al., 2013).  \n\nNevertheless, while the oceanographic processes dominate the biological processes \n\nin the pelagic habitat, the benthic and demersal habitat suffer the influence of the \n\ncontinental shelf width or the bottom type. In their work Sousa et al. (2005) defined five \n\nspecies assemblages: shallow northern, shallow southern, intermediate northern, \n\nintermediate southern and deep. Those assemblages are associated primarily with depth \n\n\n\n1. General introduction \n\n \n\n28 \n\n \n\ngradient and latitude, but coastal topography, bathymetry, coastal morphology, river runoff \n\nand currents also play an important role. In those assemblages, the seasonality is \n\nparticularly important for the shallow assemblages (Sousa et al., 2005). The species \n\nrichness in the demersal and benthic habitats is affected by the same factors (Sousa et al., \n\n2006) with the south coast presented higher species richness that the northwest coast, with \n\nspecies richness decreasing with the latitude increase. Being the latitude the main factor \n\ndriving the decreasing gradient in species richness, this is a proxy of other factors with \n\nhigher biological meaning as the shelf morphology, substrate characteristics, hydrology \n\nand oceanography, primary productivity and food availability. The narrower continental \n\nshelf associated to a higher productive area and shorter food web are the main factors that \n\ninfluence the low species richness of the northwest coast in relation to the south coast \n\n(Cunha, 2001; Sousa et al., 2006). \n\n \n\n1.4. ANALITICAL METHODS AND THEIR IMPORTANCE FOR \nECOLOGICAL STUDIES \n\nThe O. vulgaris as other cephalopods, aside from being an important fisheries \n\nresource worldwide, has also an important ecological role in the marine benthic ecosystem \n\nas a predator of several species of fish, crustacean, molluscs and other cephalopods \n\n(Quetglas et al., 1998; Velasco et al., 2001; Smith, 2003). Their life cycle characteristics of \n\nfast growing, short life cycle and semelparity associated with the absence of known \n\nmigratory patterns after settlement and their opportunistic feeding behaviour make of this a \n\ngood model to assess environmental stability or shifts.  \n\nWhile the classical biological studies of growth and spawning associated to relatively \n\nlong time series allows to follow changes in the life cycle that are closely related with local \n\nenvironmental conditions and/or environmental shifts, the studies based in the use of \n\nbiochemical tracers helps to define species habitat and can be used add trophic information \n\nto the ecosystem based models (Jackson et al., 2007). Defined as a predator of upper \n\ntrophic level, O. vulgaris has the potential to be used to study habitats and food webs in \n\nrelation to prey populations, oceanographic domains and environmental variability. \n\nThe biochemical tracers more frequently used to characterize cephalopods habitat are \n\nthe Fatty Acids (FA), mainly Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA) but also the Stable \n\nIsotopes signatures (SIS), mainly the 13C/12C (?13C) and the 15N/14N (?15N).   \n\n\n\n1. General introduction \n\n \n\n29 \n\n \n\nThe FA have been used as trophic markers since 1960's (Dalsgaard et al., 2003). The \n\nFA trophic markers (FATM), particularly PUFA are incorporated into consumers in a \n\nconservative manner, thereby providing information about predator-prey relationship not \n\nonly in short-term but also over longer periods of time as FA are going to be sequestered in \n\nthe predator reserves of lipid with time (Dalsgaard et al., 2003). Considering that most FA \n\nand particularly the PUFA are primarily produced by microalgae and zooplankton (Berg\u00e9 \n\n&amp; Barnathan, 2013; Dalsgaard et al., 2003; Pich\u00e9 et al., 2010) and the variations in the \n\nbiomass, distribution and species composition of microalgae are driven by hydrodynamic \n\nprocesses, these environmental processes are ultimately influencing the basic pattern of FA \n\nin the marine environment (Dalsgaard et al., 2003). The second most important producers \n\nof FA are the herbivorous calanoid copepods that are in a central position within the food \n\nweb linking the autotrophic organisms (phytoplankton and algae) and the second order \n\nproducers (e.g. other zooplankton species as euphausiids and fish). These calanoid \n\ncopepods feed on phytoplankton and also other copepods depending on food availability \n\nbut also are able to biosynthesize monounsaturated FA (MUFA). The balance between \n\ndifferent PUFA and between those and the MUFA in a specific moment or area is \n\nconservative through the upper levels of the food web and can be used as FA trophic \n\nmarker (FATM) to assess the feeding conditions or productivity of a specific area or season \n\n(El-Sabaawi et al., 2008; Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2012), or being used to examine differences or \n\nchanges in foraging patterns or diets, both within and between populations of predator \n\nspecies, without specifying what species are eaten (Budge et al., 2006; Iverson et al., \n\n2007).  \n\nThe FA profile in muscle and digestive gland of cephalopod species has been used to \n\nassess these species ecological role. In her work, Stowasser (2004) combined stomach \n\nanalysis with analytical methods to determine the FA profile of muscle and digestive gland \n\nof several neritic and pelagic species of squids to validate the use of FA profile but also \n\nstable isotopes signatures as indicators of squids feeding history and habitat shifts. Using \n\nfeeding experiments and samples of different locations, Stowasser proved that, although \n\nwith some limitations, is possible to follow the feeding history of species with those \n\nanalytical methods. In their work, Phillips et al. (2003a, 2003b, 2002, 2002, 2001a, 2001b) \n\ncombined analytical methods with stomach content methods studying the feeding ecology \n\nin Moroteuthis ingens but also in other polar squids. Their studies showed that the \n\ncephalopods digestive gland is a rich source of fatty acid dietary tracers (Phillips et al., \n\n\n\n1. General introduction \n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n\n2002) and can provide the history of dietary intake and indirectly give an image of the \n\nhistory of environmental conditions through the individual life history. In the same line, \n\nRosa et al. (2004a) investigated the lipid content and FA profile in the digestive gland and \n\ngonad of immature and mature O. vulgaris and O. deffilipi. In their study, they did not \n\nfound a close relationship between immature and mature gonads in both species, showing \n\nevidences that the gonad FA profile is more closely related with the food availability at that \n\ntime that with prior feeding history.   \n\nThe stable isotopes signatures, the 13C/12C (?13C) and the 15N/14N (?15N) ratios are used \n\nhere as complementary method to the lipid content and fatty acids profile giving \n\ninformation about trophic position and ontogenic changes of feeding habitat of O. vulgaris. \n\nThe measurement of ?13C and ?15N of a consumer tissues in marine food webs provides \n\nimportant indications about the ecology of individuals and species and the trophic \n\ninteractions within complex species communities (Hobson &amp; Cherel, 2006a) as they reflect \n\nthe consumers diet (Cherel and Hobson, 2005). Consumers are enriched in 15N relatively to \n\ntheir food in 2.5 \u2030 to 3 \u2030 (Vanderklift &amp; Ponsard, 2003) and consequently the ?15N \n\nmeasurements indicate the consumer trophic position (Hobson &amp; Welch, 1992). On the \n\nother hand, the ?13C vary little along the food chain but can be used to determine primary \n\nsources in a trophic network. The ?13C values indicate the lower versus higher latitudes \n\nplankton, and inshore versus offshore, or pelagic versus benthic contributions to food \n\nintake (Cherel et al., 2000).   \n\nDuring several decades, the studies on food and feeding ecology of cephalopods \n\nwere restricted to studies conducted in stomach contents (Sanchez &amp; Obarti, 1993; \n\nQuetglas et al., 1998; Smith, 2003; Rosa et al., 2004b) or based on den ecology \n\n(Katsanevakis &amp; Verripoulos, 2004). However, stomach content analysis is time \n\nconsuming and prey determination is often difficult because cephalopods tear prey into \n\nsmall pieces by their chitinous beaks and items are often too digested. Another major \n\nlimitation is that stomach contents represent the last feeding events with no indication of \n\nlong-term dietary habits (Jackson et al., 2007). \n\nRecently, several studies have been applying the stable isotopes signatures in \n\ncephalopods mainly squids (Takai et al., 2000; Cherel &amp; Hobson, 2005; Hobson &amp; Cherel, \n\n2006; Ruiz-Cooley et al., 2006; Stowasser et al., 2006; Cherel et al., 2009a) aiming to \n\nunderstand the role of cephalopods both as prey as well as predator in the marine food \n\nwebs. Some of those studies investigate the contribution of squids to the diet of top \n\n\n\n1. General introduction \n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\npredators by investigating the stable isotope signatures in beaks found in the stomachs of \n\nsperm whales (Ruiz-Cooley et al., 2006; Cherel et al., 2009b) but many investigate the role \n\nof cephalopods as predators following the stable isotope signatures in both beaks and \n\nmuscle (Takai et al., 2000; Cherel &amp; Hobson, 2005; Stowasser et al., 2006). The study \n\nconducted by Hobson &amp; Cherel, (2006) is particularly relevant. Here, the relationship \n\nbetween the isotopic signatures of prey and the beak and muscle of Sepia officinalis was \n\nassessed in a controlled environment experiment providing for the first time an estimate of \n\nisotopic discrimination between diet and hard and soft tissues of cephalopods (Hobson &amp; \n\nCherel, 2006). This study also proved that little or none discrimination between diet and \n\ntissue and that the differences found between beaks and muscle or between different beak \n\nregions are closely related with diet in a specific moment in the species life cycle and for \n\nthat reason the stable isotope signature in the beaks can be used as life cycle recorder of the \n\nfeeding and habitat, while the isotopic signature in muscle or flesh can be used as an \n\nindicator of present feeding behavior and habitat.  \n\n \n\n1.5. OBJECTIVES  \n\nO. vulgaris is one of the most studied marine species of the world. Important \n\nfisheries resource for Iberian and Mediterranean countries, potential candidate to \n\naquaculture production, biological model for physiologic and behavior studies and \n\nemblematic species known by its intelligence and survival ability, the name O. vulgaris \n\nreturns 1420 peer-reviewed papers in the web of knowledge database (724 in the last 10 \n\nyears).  \n\nHowever, the O. vulgaris life cycle combining a pelagic paralarval stage with a \n\nbenthic juvenile and adult stage, the high capacity to adapt to environmental conditions \n\n(plastic life cycle), the absence the of generations overlap and recruitment success highly \n\ndependent of the environmental conditions results in the necessity of study the adaptations \n\nof the population to the local conditions. Additionally, the paralarval dispersion processes \n\nand the grounds that offer the best settlement and growth conditions are still poorly known \n\nand appear to be quite variable. Lastly, the plastic life cycle characteristics result in highly \n\nvariable growth rates and direct relationship between size and age has been difficult to \n\naddress. This work addresses these three gaps in the knowledge about the O. vulgaris life \n\ncycle, particularly for the populations living along the Atlantic coast of the Iberian \n\nPeninsula. Under the influence of the coastal features of one of the four most productive \n\n\n\n1. General introduction \n\n \n\n32 \n\n \n\nupwelling systems, the Canary Current upwelling system, the O. vulgaris population \n\npresents particular characteristics that makes of it one of the most resilient fisheries stocks \n\nfor the coastal fisheries communities of Portugal and Galicia.  \n\nIn the chapter two, the O. vulgaris reproductive season and nutritional requirements \n\nof mature females are address under the light of the different environmental conditions \n\nexperienced in the Portuguese northwest (under WIUS) and south (under GCS) coasts. In \n\nthis chapter, we aimed to identify different reproductive strategies adopted by those two \n\npopulations defined as different spawning seasons but also addressing different strategies \n\nbetween males and females. After defining these different spawning strategies depending \n\nof environmental conditions, was time to understand how different environmental \n\nconditions affect the nutritional quality of food and if this affects the nutritional quality of \n\neggs using the mature gonads as proxies of eggs quality. Following the hypothesis that the \n\nenvironmental conditions and trophic habitat influence the biochemical composition of \n\nstorage organs and the nutritional quality of the eggs, we followed the EFA profile and the \n\ncontent of total lipids, cholesterol, triacylglycerol and phospholipids as bio-indicators of \n\nvariations in the digestive gland and in immature and fully developed gonads of females of \n\nboth populations. Here, the stable isotope signatures in the flesh and beaks were \n\ndetermined to set the trophic level of these octopus populations and proof the existence or \n\nnot of differences in the trophic level of both populations. \n\nChapter three addresses the habitat and diet requirements of the O. vulgaris \n\nparalarvae and juveniles. The R\u00eda de Vigo, an inlet ecosystem in the western coast of \n\nGalicia is an important nursery for the O. vulgaris population of the entire northeastern \n\nAtlantic coast of Iberian Peninsula. Here, we characterize the local factors that confirm the \n\nR\u00eda de Vigo as an essential fish habitat for the O. vulgaris northeastern Atlantic population. \n\nThe settlement process is still poorly unknown due to sampling limitations but the survival \n\nof juvenile during and post-settlement is important to the recruitment to fisheries \n\nsuccess.  For that reason, the identification of juvenile settlement and aggregation grounds \n\nis essential to an effective fishery management and to ensure sustainability of this heavily \n\nexploited species. Here, we aim firstly identify along the Portuguese coast areas where pre-\n\nrecruits of O. vulgaris aggregate, and secondly, to analyse the relationships between pre-\n\nrecruit abundance and several abiotic environmental variables to delineate their optimum \n\nhabitat. The preferential preys of the O. vulgaris paralarvae have been recently identified in \n\nthis area (Roura et al., 2012), nevertheless the nutritional requirements of this phase of the \n\n\n\n1. General introduction \n\n \n\n33 \n\n \n\nlife cycle, essential to successfully rear O. vulgaris paralarvae and complete the life cycle \n\nunder culture conditions, is still under debate. Here, we determine the lipid content and FA \n\nprofile of wild captured paralarvae and their potential prey. After hatch and feed in the \n\nshallow waters of the Galician and Portuguese coast, the paralarvae leave this habitat and \n\ntravel along shore until attained the reasonable size to settle.  \n\nThe chapter four is dedicated to the ageing methods. It is generally accepted that the \n\noctopus, as generally all the cephalopods have a short life span of one to two years, \n\nnevertheless doubts arise when comparing senescent O. vulgaris with one kilogram and \n\nother with six kilograms of theoretically the same age. Well studied as a captivity animal, \n\nthe pure observation of the animal in their natural status leads to conclude that the growth \n\nrate in captivity of controlled temperature and feeding at libitum hardly imitate the natural \n\nconditions. The latest achievements in determine age counting growth increments in the \n\nvestigial shell shows to be promising in the idea of determining age directly for this \n\nimportant resource. Nevertheless, an accurate and precise age determination needs to \n\nachieve the validation of different landmarks in the lifecycle of the individual as the hatch, \n\nthe settlement of the onset of maturation. Considering this, firstly we aimed to develop a \n\ntechnique to locate the stylets in the muscle of paralarvae and to determining the stylet size \n\nat hatching as a reference to the nuclear area in the post-settled stylets.

Species life cycle is \n\nshort with capacity to adapt to different environmental conditions and, considered a simultaneous \n\nterminal spawner. Data on maturation and other biological parameters collected from January 2007 to \n\nNovember 2010 are used to define spawning seasons for octopus landed by the small-scale trap fisheries \n\nin two oceanographically distinct Portuguese coastal areas: the northwest coast (western Iberia upwelling \n\nsystem) and the south coast (Gulf of Cadiz system). On a monthly basis, we followed the proportion of \n\nmature individuals, and the Gonad-Somatic and Hayashi Indices. Length-weight relationship, weight-at-\n\nmaturity, body condition and energy allocation were other biological parameters studied. Spawning \n\nseason was markedly different in both areas. The northwest population spawns from March to July, in \n\nsynchrony with the northwest coast upwelling season, and the south coast population spawns mainly in \n\nsummer, between August and September. A less intense spawning peak in early spring is present \n\noccasionally in the south coast. Weight-at-maturity is geographically indistinct, but in both areas males \n\nmature at smaller sizes than females. Body condition increases significantly during maturation and mass \n\nallocation for reproduction results indicate that males and females channel energy to reproduction from \n\nseveral sources. \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: Octopus vulgaris, ecology, environment, reproduction, condition. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n                                                        \n1\n Fisheries Research (2012) 127 \u2013 128:116 - 124 \n\n\n\n2.

Introduction \n\nThe common octopus Octopus vulgaris (Cuvier, 1797) is exploited as a target species by \n\ndemersal trawl fleets and numerous small-scale fisheries, using hand jigs, pots, traps and \n\ntrammel nets operating in southern Europe and northwestern Africa (Hastie et al., 2009). In \n\n2010, the Portuguese landings of common octopus in national ports were 12 602 tons (ten years \n\naverage landings of 9 050 tons). The small-scale fleet, using traps and pots, is responsible for \n\n95% of the common octopus landings (ICES, 2011). Nevertheless, a growing interest in this \n\nspecies as well as in other commercial cephalopod species is presently noticed for the bottom \n\ntrawl fleet, with 10% of the landings, in 2007 (Fonseca et al., 2008). \n\nCephalopods are characterized by a plastic life cycle with a recognized capacity to adapt to \n\ndifferent ecosystems, due to a short life span, high growth rate and diverse diets. O. vulgaris is a \n\nmerobenthic incirrate octopod, common in temperate shallow habitats between the coastline and \n\n200 m depth (Roper et al., 1984; Boletzky, 1992). Due to its wide distribution, O. vulgaris is one \n\nof the best models to investigate the adaptation of reproductive strategies to specific \n\nenvironmental features.  \n\nThe species is characterized by a life span of one year in Saharan bank waters to two years \n\nin Galician waters attaining relatively large sizes, of up to 6000 g in weight and 25 cm mantle \n\nlength (Domain et al., 2000; Otero et al., 2007). It is a simultaneous terminal spawner, laying on \n\naverage 350 000 eggs in sheltered places between 20 and 120 m depth (Rocha et al., 2001; Silva \n\net al., 2002). The spawning season is generally extended throughout the year with one or two \n\npeaks geographically variable in timing (Hastie et al., 2009). \n\nThe Portuguese coast is a highly dynamic oceanographic region in the temperate northeast \n\nAtlantic, influenced by two important oceanographic systems the Western Iberia Upwelling \n\nSystem (WIUS) and the Gulf of Cadiz System (GCS). The WIUS is characterized by a strong \n\ninfluence of the spring-summer coastal upwelling (F\u00eduza, 1983; Mason et al., 2005). The \n\npredominantly equatorward winds observed in summer, drive an offshore Ekman transport and \n\nforce the upwelling of colder, nutrient-rich, subsurface waters along the coast (Relvas et al., \n\n2007). The presence of the poleward current, responsible for the formation of convergence zones \n\nover the shelf-break, has an important ecological role for the retention and/or poleward transport \n\nof the phytoplankton (Ribeiro et al., 2005) and zooplankton (Santos et al., 2004), with \n\nzooplankton peaking in biomass during late spring and early summer near the outer-shelf \n\n(Cunha, 2001). All year round the coastal sea water temperature ranges between 14.4 \u00baC and 19.6 \n\n\n\n2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat \n\n \n\n39 \n\n \n\n\u00baC (Moreno et al., 2009) with a shallow thermocline developing during spring (Cunha, 2001). \n\nThe south Portuguese coast on the other hand, is influenced by the GCS. The south coast \n\norientation does not favour upwelling under northerly winds. Upwelling and downwelling events \n\ntend to be weak and the circulation is mainly wind forced and influenced by the local orography \n\n(Garc\u00eda-Lafuente &amp; Ruiz, 2007). The Cape St\u00aa Maria (36\u00ba 57\u2019N, 7\u00ba 53\u2019W) divides the continental \n\nshelf in two, supporting different oceanographic processes (Garc\u00eda-Lafuente &amp; Ruiz, 2007). East \n\nto the Cape St\u00aa\n \nMaria, the presence of the Huelva front as a warm coastal current flowing along \n\nthe shore, the significant fresh water runoff forming buoyant river plumes in spring, the \n\noccasional occurrence of the Stafford Shear, a cold-warm frontal region associated to local \n\nupwelling systems (Mason et al., 2005) and an extended Sea Surface Temperature (SST) range, \n\nbetween the 15.4 \u00baC and the 21.9 \u00baC (Moreno et al., 2009) are the main characteristics of the \n\nGCS.  \n\nStudies on the reproductive features of commercially exploited marine species such as the \n\ncommon octopus are an important tool for the assessment of the stock status. Detailed \n\ninformation about the timing and the sites of spawning, size at maturity, and sex ratio at \n\nbreeding, require a consistent assessment of the state of sexual maturity. These assessments \n\nusually involve several aspects of the reproductive development, such as the state of the gonad \n\nand the accessory reproductive structures, and are based on descriptive maturity scales and/or \n\nmaturity condition indices (Boyle &amp; Rodhouse, 2006). Due to the extensive distribution area of \n\nO. vulgaris and the commercial interest of the species in the Atlantic waters of the Iberian \n\nPeninsula, several studies have been conducted on the reproductive features of geographically \n\ndistinct sub-populations. Based in her experiments in captivity Mangold (1983) reviewed all \n\naspects of the O. vulgaris life cycle, and more recently other two reviews addressing O. vulgaris \n\nwere published (Hastie et al., 2009 and Pierce et al., 2010), compiling recent advances on \n\nfisheries and life cycle aspects.  \n\nRegarding specifically O. vulgaris reproductive aspects, several papers targeting \n\nMediterranean, Iberian and other regional sub-populations have been published since the late \n\n70\u2019s, with diversified sampling designs and methodology used to identify spawning season \n\nmainly based on proportions of mature individuals and several condition indices, such as Gonad-\n\nsomatic index or Hayashi index. Such studies rely mostly on landings from trawl fleets (e.g. \n\nQuetglas et al., 1998) and small-scale fleets (e.g. S\u00e1nchez &amp; Obarti, 1993; Hern\u00e1ndez-Garc\u00eda et \n\nal., 2002; Fernandez-Rueda &amp; Garcia-Fl\u00f3rez, 2007). A few studies were conducted with \n\nsampling designed specifically to O. vulgaris (e.g. Smith &amp; Griffiths, 2002; Oosthuizen &amp; \n\nSmale, 2003; Rodr\u00edguez-Rua et al., 2005; Katsanevakis &amp; Verripoulos, 2006).  \n\n\n\n2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat \n\n \n\n40 \n\n \n\nConsidering its regional proximity and the methodology used, the studies of Silva et al. \n\n(2002) and Otero et al. (2007) are particularly relevant for the present study. In the Northwest \n\nGalician waters, Otero et al. (2007) define a single spawning season during spring (May to June) \n\nrelated with the seasonal coastal upwelling in Galician waters, despite the presence of mature \n\nfemales all year round. In those waters, males mature at smaller sizes than females and the mass \n\ntransfer during the maturation process occurs directly from feeding sources. According to Silva \n\net al. (2002), in waters of the Gulf of Cadiz, the reproductive season covers most of the year, \n\nwith two distinct peaks in April/May and August/September. As in the previous study, males \n\nmature at smaller sizes than females. \n\nThe present study aims to identify different reproductive strategies adopted by different \n\npopulations, considering the distinct oceanographic features of the northwest coast within the \n\nWIUS and the South coast within the GCS. The reproductive strategies identified are described \n\nin terms of sex ratio, proportion of mature individuals and monthly mean gonad-somatic and \n\nHayashi indices. At the individual level, length-weight relationships are determined by sex and \n\narea, as well as maturity ogives and the size effect at maturity. Additionally the effect of size and \n\nbody condition is analyzed for each sex in both regions in order to identify sexual and regional \n\ndifferences regarding the use of storage mass for reproduction. \n\n \n\n1.5.2. Material and Methods \n \n\n1.5.2.1. Sampling  \n\nSamples were collected monthly from January 2007 to November 2010 from the small-\n\nscale trap fishery (Table 2.1) and frozen. Sampling sites were chosen considering the two \n\ndifferent oceanographic regions, the Northwest coast, with Peniche as the landing port, and the \n\nSouth coast with Olh\u00e3o as the landing port (Figure 2.1).  \n\nFor all individuals, the dorsal mantle length (ML in mm), individual weight (W in g) and \n\ndigestive gland weight (DGW in g) were measured to the nearest 5 mm and 0.1 g, respectively. \n\nTo assess maturation, the following data were collected: testis and ovary weight (TW and OW), \n\nNeedham\u2019s complex weight (NCW), oviduct weight (ODW) and oviducal complex weight \n\n(OCW), all weighed to the nearest 0.01g. A maturity scale of four stages for males (I: immature; \n\nII: maturing; III: mature; IV: post-spawning) and five stages for females (I: immature; II: \n\nmaturing; III: pre-spawning; IV: mature; V: post-spawning) was used (adapted from Guerra, \n\n1975).  \n\n\n\n2.

Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat \n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 - Sampling ports and coastal characteristics \n\n1.5.2.2. Data Analysis \n\na) Sex ratio and spawning season  \n\nIndividual weight data aggregated in 200 g weight classes by study area were analyzed \n\nusing RMIX, an algorithm designed to identify and separate normal distributions in size \n\nfrequency distributions (MacDonald and Green, 1988; MacDonald, 2008). RMIX identifies a set \n\nof overlapping component distributions that give the best fit to the histogram. The modal weight \n\nclasses, identified by visual inspection of the weight distribution, were used as the initial weight \n\nparameters. Constraints were applied in the analysis, such as a fixed variance coefficient for each \n\ncomponent. Only components with n > 50 were considered and all components were assumed to \n\nbe lognormal. \n\nThe sex ratio by month was estimated as the ratio between males and females. Significant \n\ndeviations from 1:1 were tested by a ?\n2\n test with ? = 0.05. In order to define the spawning season \n\nby study area, the proportion of mature individuals (MI) was determined monthly as: MIfi = \n\n(?Mi/Ni)f, with i as month, and M as the frequency of mature females, f (maturity stage III and \n\nIV) in each month; MImi = (?Mi/Ni)m, with i as month, and M as the frequency of mature males, \n\nm (maturity stage III) in each month. The spawning season was defined empirically as the \n\nsampling months in which MIfi > 0.1 and MImi > 0.1. \n\n\n\n2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat \n\n \n\n43 \n\n \n\nBoth the Gonad-somatic index (GSI) and the Hayashi index (HI) are important tools to \n\nassess the reproductive and maturation condition both at the individual and population level. The \n\nGSI, most indicated to assess the maturation condition in females (Guerra, 1975), was \n\ndetermined individually for all females in the form GSI  = OW*100/ (BW-OW) (Otero et al., \n\n2007). The monthly GSI was determined as the monthly mean of the individual GSI and \n\nanalyzed separately for each study area. The HI, most indicated to assess the maturation \n\ncondition in males (Guerra, 1975) was determined individually for all males in the form HI = \n\nNCW/(NCW+TW) (Otero et al., 2007). The monthly HI was determined as the monthly mean of \n\nthe individual HIm and analyzed separately for each study area. The standard error was adopted \n\nas the measure of variability for the determination of the monthly mean of GSI and HI, and \n\ndetermined as SE = ?(Var(GSIi)/ni) or SE = ?(Var(HIi)/ni) with i as month (Zar, 1999). \n\n \n\nb) Length-weight relationship and weight-at-maturity \n\nThe effect of both study area and sex in the length-weight relationship and maturity \n\nproportion was investigated with Scheff\u00e9 F-tests at a significance level ? = 0.05. In order to \n\nnormalize the data,  ML, W and MI by 200 g weight class were log transformed and compared \n\nwith a two-way ANOVA test at a significance level ? = 0.05. \n\nLength-weight relationships for combined sexes as well as for all females and all males \n\nwere determined by means of non-linear estimates by maximum likelihood of the form log (W) = \n\na+b*log(ML). Goodness of fit was expressed by r\n2\n and the significance level of the parameters \n\nestimated by a t-Student test.   \n\nA maturity curve, for each sex in each study area, was fitted to the weight frequency \n\ndistribution of the proportion (Pi) of mature individuals by 200 g weight class, with a logistic \n\nmodel: Pi = 1/(1+exp(?+?Wi) by weight class, i. Differences in the maturity curves between \n\nareas and between sexes were tested by means of the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test for \n\nsuccessive comparisons. The Weight-at-Maturity was defined as the weight class where 50% of \n\nindividuals are mature and determined from W50% = -?/?. \n\n \n\nc) Body condition and energy allocation \n\nThe body condition was determined for each study area for females and males separately, \n\nas the value of the residuals obtained from the geometric mean regression of log(BW) by \n\nlog(BW)-log(OW) for the females, replacing log(OW) by log(TW) for the males. The residuals \n\n\n\n2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat \n\n \n\n44 \n\n \n\nresulting from this analysis allow a comparison of individuals independently of body weight: \n\npositive residuals indicate animals that are heavier than predicted by the model, and negative \n\nresiduals indicate individuals that weight less than predicted. Variations in body condition were \n\ncompared by maturity stage using a one-way ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s honesty significant difference \n\nHSD post hoc test (McGrath Steer &amp; Jackson, 2004; Zar, 1999). \n\nTo study the relative energy allocation, the variation in weight between organs in mature \n\nanimals was assessed. Two geometric regressions were performed on mature individuals of each \n\nstudy area, for each sex separately: (A) the body weight vs. gonad weight and (B) the body \n\nweight vs. digestive gland weight, after log transformation. The residuals obtained from these \n\ntwo regressions, provide a size-independent estimate of the relative weight of the gonads and \n\ndigestive gland. To determine if there is a mass transfer between organs during the reproductive \n\nprocess, the residuals derived from both regressions were compared to the body weight (W), the \n\nreproductive complex weight (OW+OCW for females and TW+NCW for males) and the \n\ndigestive gland weight using the Pearson correlation test procedure (Zar, 1999).  \n\n \n\n1.5.3. Results \n \n\nThe weight of females ranged between 625 g (135 mm ML, maturity stage II, northwest \n\ncoast) and 6189 g (247 mm ML, maturity stage IV, south coast). The weight of males ranged \n\nbetween 635 g (100 mm ML, maturity stage II, south coast) and 5612 g (248 mm ML, maturity \n\nstage III, south coast). The weight distributions were significantly different between areas \n\n(?\n2\n\nKruskal-Wallis = 19.62, df = 6, p &lt;0.05) and within each area between sexes (Northwest coast, \n\n?\n2\n\nKruskal-Wallis = 28.55, df = 6, p &lt;0.05; South coast, ?\n2\n\nKruskal-Wallis = 42.07, df = 6, p &lt;0.05) (Figure \n\n2.2). Weight frequency analysis indicates that the weight distribution was bimodal in both areas. \n\nOn the Northwest coast the weight distribution presents two modal peaks in the 1100 g weight \n\nclass (modal weight, 1147 g) and in the 2200 g weight class (modal weight, 2216 g). On the \n\nSouth coast the weight distribution presents a mode in the 900 g weight class (modal weight of \n\n979 g) and another in the 1700 g weight class (modal weight of 1724 g)  (Table 2.1).  \n\n\n\n2.

In the Northwest coast, mature males were present every month with the exception of \n\nNovember 2007. For females, it is possible to identify a consistent pattern of a higher proportion \n\nof mature individuals (proportion mature > 0.10) between early spring and late summer. In the \n\nsouth coast, no mature males were found in the samples in September 2008 and October 2008, \n\nbetween March 2009 and May 2009, and in September 2010 and November 2010. In this region, \n\nthere was a non-negligible presence of mature females in late winter and earlier spring months of \n\n2007, 2008 and 2010, although the major proportion of mature females occurs in a single month \n\nin summer or late summer in each year.  \n\nConsidering the overall results, females in maturity stage I present a mean GSI of 0.198 (\u00b1 \n\n0.004, SE), in stage II of 0.507 (\u00b1 0.022), in stage III of 3.947 (\u00b1 0.215), and for fully mature \n\nfemales (stage IV) of 9.134 (\u00b1 0.566), revealing a clear separation between maturing females and \n\npre-spawning females. In males, the HI maturity index also presents increasing values from \n\nimmature to mature males, with HI values of 0.357 (\u00b1 0.004) for stage II males, and 0.429 (\u00b1 \n\n0.005) for stage III males, although in this case with overlapping extremes. For both maturity \n\nstages I and IV, not enough data were available for the determination of HI by maturity stage (n \n\n= 2 for maturity stage I, and n = 1 for maturity stage IV). \n\nIn the northwest coast (Figure 2.3) females present higher GSI between early spring and \n\nsummer, with two GSI peaks, during the studied period. After the second GSI peak, values \n\ndecrease to near 0.1, comparable to the mean GSI for stage I. Regarding males in the northwest \n\n\n\n2.

A secondary peak occurs in some spring months as is evident in \n\nMarch 2008 and June to July 2009. As for the HI of males, no specific season stands out for a \n\nhigher proportion of mature specimens, although peaks are found in January 2007, from March \n\n2008 to July 2008, and from April 2009 to March 2010, indicating that mature males are present \n\nindependently of the season. \n\n \n\n\n\n2.

The ANCOVA analysis of the influence of \n\ngeographic location and sex in length-weight relationships shows that the combined effect of \n\nboth factors is significant (area : sex, F = 11.83, p-value &lt;0.05), with the effect of the single \n\nfactor area also being significant (F = 46.93, p-value &lt;0.05) but not the effect of the single factor \n\nsex (F = 2.47, p-value > 0.05), resulting in different length-weight relationships in each area, and \n\nfor males and females in the northwest coast. In every case the increase in weight with length \n\nmay be characterized as positively allometric (b > 1).  \n\n\n\n2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat \n\n \n\n49 \n\n \n\nRegarding weight-at-maturity, the Kruskal-Wallis one-factor analysis of variance shows no \n\neffect of geographic area of origin (?\n2\n\nKruskal-Wallis = 0.20, p > 0.05) but a significant difference \n\nbetween sexes (?\n2\n\nKruskal-Wallis = 8.34, p &lt;0.05). Considering each sex separately, the effect of \n\ngeographic area was tested and a no significant effect of area was shown for both females \n\n(?\n2\n\nKruskal-Wallis = 0.11, p > 0.05) and males (?\n2\n\nKruskal-Wallis = 0.003, p > 0.05). Therefore there are \n\nonly distinct maturity ogives for males and females with different values of weight at maturity, \n\n2548.01 g for females and 1577.54g for males (Figure 2.5). \n\n \n\nTable 2.5 - Length-weight relationships determined for northwest coast and south coast considering both sexes \n\n(M+F), males and females separately: a and b as parameters of the length-weight relationships; df \u2013 degrees of \n\nfreedom; r\n2\n \u2013 linear regression coefficient; ta and tb \u2013 t-test value for the regression parameters; and p-value. \n\n a b df r\n2\n Parameter significance level \n\nN\no\n\nrt\nh\n\nw\ne\nst\n\n c\no\n\na\nst\n\n \n\nMales (M) 2.47 2.77 687 0.83 \nta = 29.04, p-value &lt;0.05 \n\ntb = 60.33, p-value &lt;0.05 \n\nFemales (F) 2.28 2.57 605 0.84 \nta = 24.86, p-value &lt;0.05 \n\ntb = 56.88, p-value &lt;0.05 \n\nM+F 2.37 2.66 1294 0.83 \nta = 37.55, p-value &lt;0.05 \n\ntb = 81.66, p-valeu &lt;0.05 \n\nS\no\n\nu\nth\n\n C\no\n\na\nst\n\n Males (M) 1.96 2.34 834 0.78 \nta = 21.37, p-value &lt;0.05 \n\ntb = 53.97, p-valeu &lt;0.05 \n\nFemales (F) 1.83 2.24 833 0.83 \nta = 23.65, p-value &lt;0.05 \n\ntb = 64.49, p-valeu &lt;0.05 \n\nM+F 1.89 2.34 1669 0.83 \nta = 31.86, p-value &lt;0.05 \n\ntb = 83.89, p-valeu &lt;0.05 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5 - Mature proportion by weight class and maturity ogives for females and males.

Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat \n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\nc) Body condition and energy allocation \n\nIn females, body condition increases significantly between the early maturation (maturity \n\nstage II) and late maturation (maturity stage III) (?stageII ? ?stageIII,, p &lt;0.05).  Males also present a \n\nconsiderable increase in body condition between maturity stage II and stage III (?stageII ? ?stageIII, \n\np &lt;0.05) (Figure 2.6).  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6 - Mean body condition (\u00b1SE) with maturity stages. \n\n \n\nThe Pearson Correlation index for female energy allocation shown by the size-independent \n\ndigestive gland weight, evidences a negative correlation to individual total weight (-0.109, df \n\n=160, p &lt;0.05) and to the weight of reproductive structures (-0.226, df =160, p &lt;0.05). In the \n\ncase of males, no significant correlation was found between the size-independent digestive gland \n\nweight and total weight or reproductive complex weight. Energy allocation shown by the size-\n\nindependent gonad weight evidences a negative correlation with total weight for both females (-\n\n0.428, df = 261, p &lt;0.05) and males (-0.256, df = 492, p &lt;0.05), and similarly with the digestive \n\ngland weight (females: -0.256, df = 261, p &lt;0.05; males: -0.412, df = 492, p &lt;0.05). \n\n \n\n1.5.4. Discussion \n\n \n\nThe definition of different spawning seasons in octopus populations within relatively short \n\ndistances off the Portuguese coast confirms the plasticity of environmental responses of the O. \n\nvulgaris life cycle, as observed in other cephalopods such as Loligo forbesi and Loligo vulgaris \n\n(Boyle et al., 1995; Moreno et al., 2005). In the northwest coast, females mature preferentially \n\n\n\n2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat \n\n \n\n51 \n\n \n\nbetween early spring and summer in a long spawning season that encompasses two spawning \n\npeaks, one in February-April and another in June-July. In this region, mature males are found all \n\nyear round and are generally more abundant in the fishery than females, due to the spawning \n\nbehaviour of the latter, which decreases their availability at spawning. In autumn, the proportion \n\nof immature females in the population increases with a decrease of mature individuals, both \n\nmales and females.  \n\nIn the south coast, the reproductive season occurs during summer peaking in September, \n\ndespite the non-negligible occurrence of mature females during late winter or early spring, which \n\nwould indicate that more favourable conditions could generate a secondary peak. Similar \n\nsituations have been described for other populations in oligotrophic conditions as in the eastern \n\nMediterranean waters and south-eastern coast of South Africa (Sanchez &amp; Obarti, 1993; \n\nOosthuizen &amp; Smale, 2003; Katsanevakis &amp; Verripoulos, 2006). Here, the overall sex ratio is \n\nbalanced towards males, which seems particularly common in commercially exploited O. \n\nvulgaris populations (Hern\u00e1ndez-Garc\u00eda et al., 2002; Fern\u00e1ndez-Rueda &amp; Garc\u00eda-Fl\u00f3rez, 2007; \n\nOtero et al., 2007). This variation in sex ratio, other than purely derived from the behavioral \n\nunavailability of females to commercial fisheries, has also been explained by a combination of \n\ndifferent factors, such as different growth rates, migrations, feeding or post-spawning behavior \n\n(Mangold, 1983) although we have not found any study that indisputably proves the existence of \n\nontogenic or reproductive migrations in populations of the common octopus.  \n\nOur results seem to indicate that it is mainly the females that display environmentally \n\nadaptive reproductive strategies. In the Northwest coast where the ocean is more dynamic, the \n\nspawning season is extended over more than 6 months usually with two reproductive peaks \n\nsimilarly to the results of Hern\u00e1ndez-Garc\u00eda et al. (2002) and Fern\u00e1ndez-Rueda &amp; Garc\u00eda-Fl\u00f3rez \n\n(2007) and Otero et al. (2007). In this area, the reproductive cycle of O. vulgaris, therefore \n\nappears to be highly connected with the long upwelling season as in other regions, such as the \n\nadjacent Galician waters and the Sahara Bank (Hatanaka, 1979; Demarq &amp; Faure, 2000; Otero et \n\nal., 2007), synchronizing hatching with ideal conditions for food supply (Otero et al., 2008; \n\nMoreno et al., 2009) combined with reduced exchanges with offshore areas (Demarq and Faure, \n\n2000). Ecologically, the WIUS is characterized by a persistent nutrient and zooplankton \n\nshoreward transport (Almeida &amp; Queiroga, 2003; Santos et al., 2004; Queiroga et al. 2007), \n\nfavored by the westerly winds in late winter and spring, that create a continuous supply of food \n\nand potentiate the survival of two cohorts of paralarvae, hatching approximately four months \n\napart, in July and November (Mangold &amp; Boletzky, 1987; Otero et al., 2008; Moreno et al., \n\n2009).     \n\n\n\n2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat \n\n \n\n52 \n\n \n\nIn the South coast, where conditions are more stable but less productive, females \n\nconcentrate spawning over a shorter period of time. The factors that trigger the onset of the \n\nreproduction seem to be related with the seasonal occurrence of favourable oceanographic \n\nconditions, such as higher temperatures and salinities, favoured by the easterly winds which are \n\ncommon during summer in the coastal areas close to Cape St\u00aa Maria (S\u00e1nchez &amp; Relvas, 2003; \n\nGarc\u00eda-Lafuente et al. 2006). Ecologically, the GCS is a less dynamic and oligotrophic system, \n\nin which species tend to direct all of their energy onto a single spawning peak, such as in the case \n\nof the sardine Sardina pilchardus, the anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and the wedge sole \n\nDicologlossa cuneata (Bald\u00f3 et al., 2006). In the case of the common octopus, individuals spawn \n\nin late summer, with the next generation hatching in winter, when the predominant westerly \n\nwinds favor the transport of nutrients and zooplankton near to the Cape St\u00aa Maria (Garc\u00eda-\n\nLafuente &amp; Ruiz, 2007).  \n\nActually, these differences of timing and spawning strategies adopted by neighboring O. \n\nvulgaris populations is also observed on the South African coast, where the southwest coast is \n\nbathed by the cold-water northward flowing Benguela Current producing long and strong \n\nupwelling events, and the southeastern coast is influenced by the Agulhas Current, a western \n\nboundary current that transports warm equatorial water pole wards (Gibbons et al., 2010). On the \n\nwest coast, O. vulgaris females spawn throughout the year but mainly between spring and \n\nsummer (Smith &amp; Griffiths, 2002), and in the southeast coast, females spawn in summer, in a \n\nshorter and more intense spawning season (Oosthuizen &amp; Smale, 2003).     \n\nThe length-weight relationship in the present study varies not only with sex but also with \n\nregion, apparently reflecting environmental conditions. For the northwest region we determined \n\ndifferent length-weight relationships for females and males, both positively allometric, but \n\nshowing that males increase in weight faster than females (bmales > bfemales). In the south coast, no \n\ndifferences were found in the length-weight relationship between sexes and both present lower \n\nincreases in weight with length than either sex in the northwest coast. \n\nIt is particularly interesting to note that in this study, geographic area is not reflected in \n\nmaturity ogives, which may suggest that biological constraints could be imposing limits to \n\nminimum maturation body size, as occurs in other cephalopod species (see e.g. Boavida-Portugal \n\net al., 2010 and Moreno et al., 2005). The weight-at-maturity for females is 2550 g and 1577 g \n\nfor males. The differences found between sexes are probably linked with the simultaneous \n\nterminal spawning strategy, with females having to store reserves that are then mobilized to \n\nproduce yolk, and for behavioral traits related to egg laying and protection. Additionally males \n\nprobably reach maturity earlier in the life cycle, followed by an earlier decrease in growth rate \n\n\n\n2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat \n\n \n\n53 \n\n \n\n(Mangold, 1983; Smith et al., 2005). However, weight-at-maturity registered for both sexes in \n\nour samples is higher than previously published for adjacent waters. In the northerly neighboring \n\nwaters of Galicia, females mature at 1788.3 g and males at 903.4 g (Otero et al., 2007), and in \n\nthe southeastern neighboring waters of the Gulf of Cadiz females mature at 2023 g and males at \n\n671 g (Silva et al., 2002). The differences found in the weight-at-maturity in different regions \n\nmay be related with the sampling strategy followed by each author, since weight-at-maturity \n\ndecreases at peak population maturity (Moreno, 2008) and thus the proportion of samples taken \n\nfrom peak reproduction seasons in relation to those obtained throughout the year affects the size-\n\ncomposition of the sample of mature females. It can also indirectly result from the gears with \n\nwhich the samples were collected, since some gears are less likely to collect fully mature females \n\n(Fern\u00e1ndez-Rueda &amp; Garc\u00eda-Fl\u00f3rez, 2007). It is therefore likely that there is high variability \n\nbetween individuals in any population and that sample characteristics, among which size and \n\ntiming, may strongly influence the results. It seems reasonable to assume, and has been \n\ndemonstrated, that maturity is first of all driven by a minimum weight limit and subsequently \n\nmodulated by biological and environmental conditions. In our samples, there is a significant \n\nincrease in body condition for both females and males between stage II (immature) and stage III \n\n(pre-spawning), indicating that the relative success of somatic growth in this pre-spawning stage \n\nmay be crucial to determine subsequent events (McGrath Steer &amp; Jackson, 2004; Otero et al., \n\n2007).  \n\nMass allocation data show that reserves are heading for reproduction in both sexes, \n\nalthough some differences can be found between males and females, in accordance with the \n\nstudies conducted by Otero et al. (2007) and Rosa et al. (2004), and similarly to Loligo forbesi \n\n(Collins et al., 1995; Smith et al., 2005). Considering that males mature at smaller sizes than \n\nfemales, and can maintain this stage for several months until a female is available to breed, there \n\nseems to be a differentiated breeding strategy between males and females. Other studies, such as \n\nGon\u00e7alves et al. (2002) and Rodr\u00edguez-Rua et al. (2005), additionally suggest that mature males \n\nare able to breed with immature females which receive and store the mature spermatophores \n\ninside the oviducal glands until the oocytes mature. However, only the mass transfer between \n\norgans was considered here, and this should be complemented by a study of the types of \n\nenergetic nutrients that are transferred between organs.  \n\nThe present study has shown the potential influence and relative importance of \n\nenvironmental factors on the reproduction cycle of O. vulgaris, modulating timing, intensity and \n\nsynchronism. Other studies have been constantly disclosing interactions that may improve our \n\nunderstanding of the main mechanisms. Nevertheless, in terms of population segregation, it \n\n\n\n2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat \n\n \n\n54 \n\n \n\nseems evident that even under conditions of apparent genetic homogeneity (Cabranes et al., \n\n2008), populations subjected to fisheries in different geographic areas must be managed \n\ndifferently. And if we agree on the extent of its distribution pattern, O. vulgaris is one of the most \n\ndiversely impacted cephalopods in terms of environmental exposure.   \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nThe authors wish to express their acknowledgment to Pedro Mendon\u00e7a for assistance with the biological sampling. \n\nThe authors also thank four anonymous referees for their comments, which greatly improved the final version of this \n\npaper.

Trophic habitat and gonad quality of neighbouring populations off the Portuguese coast, subject \n\nto different oceanographic regimes, were compared using the digestive gland and beaks as recorders of \n\ntrophic and habitat preferences, and gonads as indicators of egg quality. Cholesterol, phospholipids\u2019 and \n\ntriacylglycerol content, essential fatty acid (EFA) profile of the digestive gland and stable isotopes, ?\n15\n\nN \n\nand ?\n13\n\nC, in the buccal mass flesh and beaks were indicators of the differences in the trophic habitat \n\nbetween populations. For gonad quality, the same bio-indicators were used to identify differences with \n\nmaturation. The study shows that, although diet influences the EFA profile of the gonads to a certain \n\ndegree, the main lipid content, phospholipids and cholesterol content in the gonads are not influenced by \n\nhabitat conditions. This therefore suggests that O. vulgaris is able to influence the quality of egg content \n\nindependently of diet. The species is believed to be an income breeder which attains maturity upon \n\nreaching a sufficient condition level, then channelling energy directly from food to gonad development.  \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: Octopus vulgaris, trophic habitat, gonad quality, bio-indicators.   \n\n \n\n \n \n\n                                                        \n2\n Hydrobiologia 725 (2013): 33-46. \n\n\n\n2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat \n\n \n\n59 \n\n \n\n2.2.1. Introduction \n\nThe common octopus, Octopus vulgaris Cuvier (1797) is an important fisheries resource \n\nand a key component of coastal food webs as a prey and generalist predator (Smith, 2003; \n\nKatsanevakis &amp; Verripoulos, 2004). The species is believed to channel energy to growth and \n\nreproduction directly from food (Quetglas et al. 2011; Smith et al. 2011). It is a species with high \n\nfeeding and turnover rates (Semmens et al. 2004), short life cycle and high plasticity to \n\nenvironmental conditions. Studies on the molecular and nutritional composition of reserve and \n\nreproductive organs reflect the benthic characteristics of the species. The habitat biodiversity and \n\nenergy flow to which the populations are exposed are mirrored in the molecular and energetic \n\ncomposition of the tissues (e. g. Rosa et al. 2004a; Bandarra et al. 2006; Cherel et al. 2009; \n\nGarc\u00eda-Garrido et al. 2010).  \n\nThe diet of O. vulgaris depends on the life-cycle stage, size, depth of occurrence, habitat \n\nand seasonal availability of their prey (Nixon, 1985; Smith, 2003). The cephalopod hepato-\n\npancreas or digestive gland has different functions in the physiology Octopus spp., including the \n\nsynthesis and secretion of digestive enzymes, the reabsorption and metabolism of nutrients; \n\nsynthesis and storage of lipids like cholesterol, lipoproteins, glycogen, pigments, vitamins and \n\nprotein-bound Fe, Cu, Ca and non-physiological heavy metals; and excretion and rejection of \n\nwaste products of the digestion and cell metabolism (Blanchier &amp; Boucaud-Camou, 1984; \n\nBudelmann et al. 1997; Moltschaniwskyj &amp; Johnston, 2006). Its function as a storage organ \n\nindicates its utility as the ideal source of dietary tracers such as essential fatty acids (EFA) \n\n(Phillips et al. 2001) and dietary lipids (e.g. triacylglycerol and cholesterol) that are deposited in \n\nthis organ with little or no modification of the lipid content (Boucaud-Camou &amp; Boucher-\n\nRodoni, 1983; Phillips et al. 2003).  \n\nLipids are important dietary constituents, providing energy, vitamins and EFA. Cholesterol \n\nis the predominant sterol in the cephalopods lipids reserves (Sieiro et al. 2006) and proxy of the \n\nproduction of hormones in marine invertebrates (Kanazawa, 2002). The endogenous synthesis of \n\ncholesterol seems to be absent in cephalopods, suggesting that it is an essential dietary nutrient \n\n(Villanueva &amp; Norman, 2008). Triacylglycerol is a neutral lipid involved in fatty acid (FA) \n\nstorage and metabolism (Lee et al. 2006).The FAs incorporated within the phospholipids act as \n\nbuilding blocks for the membrane lipid bilayer (Athenstaedt &amp; Daum, 2006; Berg\u00e9 &amp; Barnathan, \n\n2005; Dalsgaard et al. 2003). The triacylglycerol and phospholipids seasonal variability is related \n\nwith cellular mechanisms under different environmental conditions and because of that, they are \n\ngood indicators of condition (Shulman &amp; Love, 2006). The most important EFA are arachidonic \n\nacid C20:4n6 (ARA), eicosapentaenoic acid C20:5n3 (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid C22:6n3 \n\n\n\n2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat \n\n \n\n60 \n\n \n\n(DHA). The requirements on ARA, EPA and DHA and the balance between them are important \n\nfor growth (Navarro &amp; Villanueva, 2000; Shulman &amp; Love, 2006). These EFA are related with \n\nthe energy channelling, the cellular membrane structure and function, and are integral elements \n\nof phospholipids as components of lipid bilayers (Tocher, 2010). \n\nReproduction timing in O. vulgaris depends on the local oceanographic regime: a long \n\nseason in productive systems, frequently with two reproductive peaks; and a shorter season (one \n\nto two months) in oligotrophic systems (Louren\u00e7o et al. 2012). The formation of the yolk is \n\nextremely important during maturation and egg development, because the newly hatched \n\nparalarvae are not truly lecithotrophic depending to some extent on these reserves to survive \n\n(Boletzky, 1975, Villanueva &amp; Norman, 2008). The nutritional content of the yolk is mainly \n\nprotein, but lipids are also important for membrane formation and energetic supply (11-14% of \n\ndry weight) particularly the of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), phospholipids and cholesterol \n\n(Navarro &amp; Villanueva, 2000). \n\nThe ?\n13\n\nC and ?\n15\n\nN signatures in different tissues of a predator like O. vulgaris reflect its \n\nhabitat and trophic position respectively (Cherel &amp; Hobson, 2005). Consumers or predators are \n\nenriched in \n15\n\nN relative to their food and consequently the ?\n15\n\nN measurement is an indicator of \n\nthe consumer trophic position (Hobson &amp; Cherel, 2006; Vander Zanden &amp; Rasmussen, 2001).\n \n\nWith little variation along the food chain, the ?\n13\n\nC is used to determine primary sources in the \n\ntrophic web indicating the habitat of the organism, and the inshore vs offshore, or pelagic vs \n\nbenthic contribution of food intake (Cherel &amp; Hobson, 2007; Jackson et al. 2007). The \n\ndetermination of ?\n13\n\nC and ?\n15\n\nN stable isotope signatures both in muscle and in cephalopod beaks \n\nare complementary approaches to stomach content and fatty acid analysis in studies of trophic \n\ndynamics and feeding ecology, permitting the identification of ontogenic migration and feeding \n\nshift events (Stowasser, 2004; Jackson et al. 2007). In species like O. vulgaris, diet studies are \n\ndifficult to carry out due to the diversity of preys (Smith, 2003); the fast digestion rate (Boucaud-\n\nCamou and Boucher-Rodoni, 1983); and the large number of empty stomachs. For these cases, \n\nan analytic approach combining fatty acids and stable isotopes analyses provides overall \n\ninformation on the average diet regarding both trophic level and habitat of a particular \n\npopulation. \n\nHere we hypotheses that environmental conditions, including the trophic habitat, influence \n\nthe biochemical composition of storage organs and the nutritional quality of the eggs (indirectly \n\npotentially affecting the next generation). The Portuguese coast presents an advantageous \n\ngeographical setting where it is possible to follow O. vulgaris populations which are subjected to \n\ndistinct environmental conditions: in the northwest coast, one of the populations is in a \n\n\n\n2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat \n\n \n\n61 \n\n \n\nproductive system integrated in the Western Iberia Upwelling System (Relvas et al. 2007); in the \n\nsouth, the other is integrated in the Gulf of Cadiz System influenced by the oligotrophic and \n\nwarmer waters of the Huelva front where downwelling and upwelling events are weaker and not \n\nseasonal (Garc\u00eda-Lafuente et al. 2006). To test our hypothesis, we followed the EFA profile and \n\nthe content of total lipids, cholesterol, triacylglycerol and phospholipids as bio-indicators of \n\nvariations in the digestive gland and in immature and fully developed gonads of females of both \n\npopulations. We also followed the ?\n13\n\nC and ?\n15\n\nN stable isotope signatures in the upper and lower \n\nbeaks and buccal mass tissue of immature and mature individuals to identify the possible \n\ndifferences in the overall diet between population and maturity stages. \n\n \n\n2.2.2. Material and Methods \n\n2.2.2.1. Sampling \n\n \n\nAll tissue samples were obtained from females captured in the small-scale O. vulgaris \n\nfisheries from March to April 2011 within the two study areas represented by landings in ports of \n\nPeniche (northwest coast area; lat: 39\u00ba 21.40 N, long: 9\u00ba 20.38 W) and Olh\u00e3o (south coast area; \n\nlat: 36\u00ba 59.34 N, long: 7\u00ba 50.44 W). Within each area, five immature females and five mature \n\nfemales were selected and digestive gland tissue and gonads were collected, freeze dried and \n\nstored at -20\u00baC.  \n\nCleaned upper and lower beaks and buccal mass muscular tissue (referred as flesh \n\nhereafter) samples were collected from frozen animals and kept in 70% ethanol for isotopic \n\nanalysis. Sampling was conducted considering the same explanatory factors, area and maturity in \n\nan unbalanced sampling design, collecting 27 flesh samples (4 mature and 6 immature samples \n\nin the northwest coast and 5 mature and 12 immature samples in the south coast) and 33 beak \n\nsamples (8 mature and 9 immature in the northwest coast and 5 mature and 12 immature in the \n\nsouth coast). The dorsal mantle length and individual weight were measured to the nearest 5 mm \n\nand 0.1 g, respectively. Immature and maturing females were classified as immature whereas \n\nmature and spawning females were classified as mature (according to Guerra 1975).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n2.

To avoid the \n\ndepletion of ?\n13\n\nC values due to lipids presence, flesh samples were rinsed successively in a 2:1 \n\nchloroform-methanol solution (Cherel et al. 2005). Nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios were \n\ndetermined via Finningan conflo II interface to a Thermo Delta V S mass spectrometer coupled \n\nto a Flash EA1112 Series elemental analyser. Approximately 0.3 mg of each sample was \n\ncombusted in a tin cup for the simultaneous determination of nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios. \n\nIsotope ratios are presented in the usual ? notation relative to the PeeDee Belemnite (PDB) for \n\ncarbon and atmospheric N2 (AIR) for nitrogen, and expressed as \u2030. Replicate measurements of \n\ninternal laboratory standards (acetanilide) indicate a precision of &lt;0.2\u2030 both for ?\n13\n\nC and ?\n15\n\nN. \n\nThe C/N mass ratio was used to check the effectiveness of the lipid extraction in the flesh and in \n\nthe beaks (Post et al. 2007; Cherel et al. 2009). \n\nPrior to the statistical analysis, the assumptions of normality and sample variance \n\nhomogeneity were assessed by Shapiro-Wilk\u2019s test, and Bartlett\u00b4s test, respectively. A paired t-\n\ntest was performed to assess possible differences in stable isotope signatures between upper and \n\nlower beaks. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to assess the effect of \n\narea, maturity and the interaction between the two factors in the ratios ?\n13\n\nC and ?\n15\n\nN in the upper \n\nand lower beaks and flesh. The hypothesis for the two-way ANOVA was formulated under the \n\nassumption of: H0A: there is no main effect of the factor area on the stable isotope (?\n13\n\nC or ?\n15\n\nN) \n\nmean value in the beaks upper and lower beaks and flesh; H0B: there is no main effect of the \n\nfactor maturity on the stable isotope mean value in the upper and lower beaks and flesh; H0C: \n\nthere is no additive effect of the interaction between area and maturity on the stable isotope mean \n\nvalue in the upper and lower beaks and flesh. If H0C was rejected, a post-hoc Tukey test for \n\nmultiple comparisons was performed to determine which combination of factors were \n\nsignificantly different (p-value &lt;0.05).  \n\n \n\n2.2.2.2. Lipid class analyses  \n\n \n\nThe total lipid (TL) fraction was extracted by the Bligh &amp; Dyer (1959) method. Samples of \n\n? 1 g and ? 2 g of dry tissue of digestive glands and gonads were used respectively. The results \n\nwere expressed as g lipid/100 g dry weight. Lipid classes were determined by different \n\nspectrophotometric methods. The phospholipids fraction was purified from the total lipid extract \n\n\n\n2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat \n\n \n\n63 \n\n \n\naccording to Auborg et al. (1996). Total phospholipids were quantified by measuring the organic \n\nphosphorus in total lipid extracts according to the Raheja et al. (1973) method based on a \n\ncomplex formation with ammonium molybdate. Results are expressed as g PL/100 g dry weight. \n\nTotal cholesterol was determined in the total lipids extracts by the method of Huang et al. (1961) \n\nbased on the Liebermann-Buchardt reaction. Results are expressed in g cholesterol/100 g dry \n\nweight. FA composition of lipids present in the Bligh &amp; Dyer extract was determined converting \n\ntotal lipids into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), according to the method described by Lepage &amp; \n\nRoy (1984). FAME were analysed by gas chromatography. Peaks corresponding to FAs were \n\nidentified by comparison of their retention times with standard mixtures. Peak areas were \n\nautomatically integrated with C19:0 being used as an internal standard for quantitative analysis. \n\nThe concentration of each fatty acid or fatty acid group was expressed as g/100g total FAME.  \n\nPrior to the statistical analysis, the assumptions of normality and sample variance \n\nhomogeneity were assessed with Shapiro-Wilk\u2019s and Bartlett\u00b4s tests, respectively. Whenever \n\nthese assumptions failed the data were log-transformed to guarantee normality and variance \n\nhomogeneity. Two-way ANOVA was performed to assess the effect of area, maturity and the \n\ninteraction between the two factors in the lipid classes in the digestive gland and in the gonad. \n\nThe hypothesis for the two-way ANOVA was formulated under the assumption of: H0A: there is \n\nno main effect of the factor area on the lipid class content in the tissue; H0B: there is no main \n\neffect of the factor maturity on the lipid class content in the tissue; H0C: there is no additive effect \n\nof the interaction between area and maturity on the mean lipid class content in the tissue. If H0C \n\nwas rejected, a post-hoc Tukey test for multiple comparisons was performed to determine which \n\nfactor combinations were significantly different.   \n\nMajor FAs were defined as those presenting concentration by area and by maturity stage \n\nhigher than 1g/100g of FAME. For each FA, the assumption of sample normality and \n\nhomogeneity was tested by the Shapiro-Wilk\u2019s and Bartlett\u00b4s respectively by tissue and factor \n\n(area and maturity), when these assumptions failed, the variable was log-transformed. \n\nDifferences in mean concentration of each FA between area and maturity stage were tested with \n\nt-test (Zar, 1999). The major fatty acids profile was compared by explanatory factor, area and \n\nmaturity and the interaction between area and maturity by means of Multivariate ANOVA \n\n(MANOVA), followed by Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA).  The MANOVA and DFA are \n\ncomplementary approaches based in the separation of observation groups represented by their \n\ncentroids obtained under the effect of two or more factors levels (Quinn and Keough, 2002). \n\nDFA is particularly useful to detect the variables that better discriminates between different \n\nobservation groups (Zuur et al. 2007).  \n\n\n\n2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat \n\n \n\n64 \n\n \n\n2.2.3. Results \n\n2.2.3.1. Diet and Habitat \n  \n\nAccording to the mean C:N mass ratio, lipids were effectively removed from flesh (C:N = \n\n3.13 \u00b1 0.06 , mean \u00b1 standard deviation, SD) and from beaks (upper beak: 3.38 \u00b1 0.07; lower \n\nbeak: 3.33 \u00b1 0.08).  The flesh of O. vulgaris females presents a mean ?\n15\n\nN of 11.86 \u00b1 0.66 (SD) \n\n\u2030, and the mean ?\n13\n\nC value of -16.77 \u00b1 0.74 (SD) \u2030 (Figure 2.7) independently of area, \n\nmaturity stage or the interaction of both factors (Table 2.6). Upper and lower beaks present \n\ndifferent ?\n15\n\nN and ?\n13\n\nC signatures between then (for ?\n15\n\nN: paired t = -2.12; df = 32, p-value &lt;\n\n0.01; for ?\n13\n\nC: paired t = -4.14, df = 32, p-value &lt;0.01). The factorial ANOVA shows that area \n\nhas a significant effect in ?\n15\n\nN signature (Table 2.6), with both beaks presenting higher values in \n\nsouth coast (Figure 2.7). The ?\n13\n\nC signature is not affected by area in both beaks (Table 2.6).  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.7 - Octopus vulgaris flesh and upper and lower beaks stable isotope ?\n15\n\nN and ?\n13\n\nC signatures by \n\nexplanatory factors area and maturity.

The dot indicates the mean value for the ?\n15\n\nN and ?\n13\n\nC for each tissue studied; the \n\nerror bars indicate the magnitude of standard deviation on either axis. \n\n \n\n\n\n2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat \n\n \n\n65 \n\n \n\nThe mean individual weight of the females collected was 2340.30 \u00b1 979.45 (SD) g in the \n\nnorthwest coast and 2637.40 \u00b1 479.00 (SD) g in the south coast. Digestive gland and gonad \n\npresented different mean content in total lipids and lipid classes, with the digestive gland \n\npresenting higher mean content of total lipids, cholesterol and triacylglycerol (Figure 2.8). \n\nDespite that, the gonads were richer in phospholipids than the digestive gland (Figure 2.8).  \n\nIn the digestive gland the mean total lipid content and mean cholesterol content was \n\ndepended on area. The digestive glands collected in the northwest coast presented a significantly \n\nlower content of total lipids (t = -2.42, df = 18, p-value &lt;0.01), and higher mean content in \n\ncholesterol (t = 7.91, df = 18, p-value &lt;0.01, see Figure 2.8) when compared with south coast. \n\nThe two-way ANOVA for the interaction between the factors area and maturity showed \n\nsignificant differences in the mean content of cholesterol and triacylglycerol due to the additive \n\neffect of the two factors (Table 2.6).  \n\nIn the digestive gland, the fatty acids (FA) represented 31?g/mg and 46 ?g/mg of the total \n\nlipid content in the northwest coast and the south coast, respectively. The most abundant FA were \n\nthe saturated fatty acids (SFA), followed by the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and the \n\nmonounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) (Table 2.7). The mean content of myristic acid, C14:0, \n\npalmitoleic acid, C16:1n7, gondoic acid C20:1n9, ARA, C20:4n6 and DHA were significantly \n\ndifferent between areas, as well as the ratio DHA/EPA mainly due to the increase in DHA \n\ncontent in digestive glands of the south coast (Table 2.7). Results of the MANOVA analysis \n\nshowed that content levels depend both on area and maturity, with no effect on the interaction \n\nbetween both factors (Table 2.8). In the DFA, the first discriminant function maximizes the \n\ndifferences between groups. The DFA for region groups show that the first function explained \n\n84% of the variability, with a good separation between the northwest coast group (class score = \n\n0.92) and the south coast group (class score = -0.92). The FA that contributed the most to the \n\ngroup separation was the DHA which was positively correlated with the south coast and \n\nnegatively correlated with northwest coast. The DFA for maturity groups showed a good \n\nseparation between immature (class score = - 0.85) and mature digestive glands (class score = \n\n1.02) with 86 % of explained variation. The FAs that most contributed to the group separation \n\nwere EPA and DHA and C18:0. The DFA for area x maturity groups (Figure 2.9, Digestive \n\ngland) showed a poor separation between groups with an explained variance of 51% in \n\naccordance with MANOVA results. Nevertheless, the FAs that contributed the most to the group \n\nseparation were: DHA, positively related with immature females of the south coast area and \n\nnegatively related with the immature and mature females from northwest coast: EPA, positively \n\n\n\n2.

Maturity \n\n \n\nStable isotope signatures showed that the ?\n13\n\nC signature is statistically significant \n\ndifferent with the maturity stage (Table 2.6), with the beaks of immature females \n\npresenting significant higher ?\n13\n\nC signature (Figure 2.7).   \n\nThe effect of different nutritional levels on maturity was studied by assessing \n\ndifferences in the digestive gland and gonads with maturity. For the digestive gland, there \n\nwas no effect of this factor in the lipid classes content studied (Table 2.6). Total lipid, \n\ncholesterol and triacylglycerol content tended to increase from immature to mature females \n\nalthough this increase is not statistically significant. In relation to the phospholipid content, \n\nthe digestive glands of mature females of south coast were significantly poor in \n\n\n\n2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat \n\n \n\n69 \n\n \n\nphospholipids in relation to the immature ones (t = 3.50, df = 18, p-value &lt;0.01) (Figure \n\n2.8). Nevertheless, when comparing the digestive glands lipid content between mature \n\nfemales of northern coast with mature females of south coast, some differences arose. \n\nParticularly, the total lipid content (t = -2.82, df = 18, p-value = 0.01), the cholesterol \n\ncontent (t = 10.52, df = 18, p-value &lt;0.01) and the phospholipids content (t = 6.04, df = \n\n18, p-value &lt;0.01) were significantly higher in the mature digestive glands of south coast \n\n(Figure 2.8).   \n\n Mature gonads of the northwest coast present higher contents in triacylglycerol, \n\ncholesterol and phospholipids, although no significant differences were found for the mean \n\ncontent of those bio-indicators between immature and mature individuals (Figure 2.8, \n\nTable 2.6). In the south coast, the gonads of mature individuals are significant higher than \n\nimmature individuals in triacylglycerol (t = -2.86, df = 18, p-value &lt;0.01) and \n\nphospholipids (t = 3.50, df = 18, p-value &lt;0.01).  \n\nThe FA profile in the gonads was affected by area, maturity, and by the interaction \n\nof both factors (Table 2.8). Mature gonads were rich in SFA, showing the capacity to \n\nproduce saturated fatty acids namely palmitic acid C16:0, increasing significantly from \n\nimmature to mature females in the northwest coast.  In opposition, the stearic acid C18:0 in \n\nthe northwest coast decreased from immature to mature gonads (Table 2.7). MUFA were \n\nthe second most abundant fatty acids in the gonads, with the presence of vaccenic acid \n\nC18:1n7 as a minor FA, presenting significant differences between the northwest coast and \n\nthe south coast namely in the FA C17:1 and C20:1n9. The FA C16:1n7 was significantly \n\nmore abundant in immature than in mature gonads from the northwest coast. The PUFA \n\nrepresented between 9% and 13% of the FAME present in the total lipid content of the \n\ngonads, with the content in ARA, DHA and EPA decreasing significantly from immature to \n\nmature gonads in both study areas. In particular, the significant decrease in DHA in the \n\nnorthwest coast leaded to significant differences between the DHA/EPA ratio of immature \n\nand mature females in that area (Table 2.7). \n\nThe DFA on the FA profile of the females\u2019 gonads between areas showed that the \n\nfirst function explained 79% of the variability , with a good separation between the \n\nnorthwest coast group (class score = 0.82) and the south coast group (class score = -0.97). \n\nThe FA that contributed the most to the group separation is the C18:0 which is positively \n\ncorrelated with the northwest coast. The DFA for maturity groups showed a good \n\nseparation between immature (class score = - 0.94) and mature individuals (class score = \n\n\n\n2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat \n\n \n\n70 \n\n \n\n0.79) with 74 % of the variability explained. The FA that contributed the most to the group \n\nseparation was the C18:0, positively correlated to the immature individuals. The DFA for \n\narea x maturity groups (Figure 2.9, Gonad) showed a good separation between groups with \n\nan explained variability of 95% in concordance with MANOVA results. The FAs that \n\ncontributed the most to the group separation were C16:0, 18:0 and ARA that were \n\npositively correlated with immature gonads from both areas.    \n\n \n\n2.2.4. Discussion \n\n \n\nThe ?\n15\n\nN and ?\n13\n\nC signatures in the flesh seem to be adequate short term indicators \n\nof diet and habitat. Cherel &amp; Hobson (2005), working on Psychroteuthis glacialis, \n\nsuggested that the difference between the ?\n15\n\nN of the flesh relative to the beaks relates to \n\nthe chitin synthesis and consequent N accretion in the beaks. In the more recently formed \n\nregions of the beaks, such as the wing, the ?\n13\n\nC signature of the predator closely matches \n\nthat of the prey (Hobson and Cherel, 2006), therefore also reflecting to an extent the recent \n\ndietary composition. The ?\n15\n\nN and ?\n13\n\nC of beaks are therefore used as indicators of habitat \n\nand diet preference (Post, 2002; Jackson et al. 2007). In our southern population of O. \n\nvulgaris, beak ?\n13\n\nC signature is different between maturity stages, probably a reflection of \n\nthe recent trophic history of the different maturation stages. The higher ?\n15\n\nN ratio in the \n\nbeaks from the south coast in relation to the northwest coast is probably related to the \n\nhigher frequency of occurrence of crustacean prey (e.g. decapod crabs) found in the diet of \n\nO. vulgaris sampled (Louren\u00e7o, unpublished data). Rosa et al. (2004b) show that the \n\ndecapod crabs are important prey of the O. vulgaris populations along the Portuguese coast \n\nand the presence of crustacean prey in the diet of Loligo forbesi is known to increases the \n\n?\n15\n\nN content of the beaks and flesh of that species (Stowasser 2004). Darnaude et al. \n\n(2004) relate increased ?\n15\n\nN to a significant input from river plumes, through the added \n\ninput of ?\n15\n\nN rich particulate organic matter. This however does not appear to be the case \n\nof our study, since river input is more important on the west than on the south coast.  \n\nConsidering that the digestive gland is mainly a lipid reservoir and therefore has a \n\nhigh lipid content, it is the ideal organ to trace fatty acids as diet bio-indicators (Phillips et \n\nal. 2001;  Moltschaniwskyj &amp; Johnston, 2006; Garc\u00eda-Garrido et al. 2010). In our study the \n\ntotal lipid content ranged between 14.60 % in northwest coast immature females, in line \n\nwith values obtained by Rosa et al. (2004a), and 24.42 % in south coast mature females. \n\n\n\n2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat \n\n \n\n71 \n\n \n\nContrary to what might be expected for a nutrient rich area, the digestive glands of the \n\nnorthwest coast population present relatively low lipid content in comparison to the south \n\ncoast population, in particular of the storage lipid triacylglycerol. This is probably related \n\nto nutrient seasonality. In March and April the pre-upwelling conditions in the northeast \n\ncoast determine a low fat content in sardine Sardina pilchardus (Bandarra et al. 2006) and \n\nhorse-mackerel Trachurus trachurus (Bandarra et al. 2001), while on the other hand \n\nphytoplankton peaks in the south coast are common in early spring associated with the \n\nwarmer and nitrogen rich river plumes. Conditions in the south are then relatively \n\nfavourable to the development of earlier phytoplankton blooms dominated by \n\ndinoflagellates  (Navarro and Ruiz, 2006; Crespo et al. 2012), which is corroborated by the \n\nhigher relative content in ARA, EPA and DHA produced by the community of primary \n\nproducers (Dalsgaard et al. 2003). \n\n The high digestive gland content of C18:1n9 (? 11 % in both study areas), which is \n\nindicative of deep waters prey species, and C16:0 (? 20% in both study areas) which is \n\nindicative of the presence of herbivorous preys, actually suggest a diverse diet (Pich\u00e9 et al. \n\n2010). Comparing both areas, the DHA/EPA ratio is exceptionally low in the north-western \n\npopulation. According to Dalsgaard et al. (2003), the DHA content should be higher \n\nrelative to the EPA for a carnivorous species. In their study Rosa et al. (2004b) observed \n\nthe possibility of a carnivorous preys on the northwest coast, while this study highlights a \n\ndominance of a carnivorous preys towards the south coast. A higher triacylglycerol content \n\nin the South can in addition be related with the dominance of crustacean preys (Phillips et \n\nal. 2003) in the diet of the population of this area, which is also suggested by the ?\n15\n\nN and \n\n?\n13\n\nC of the beaks. \n\nIt is therefore likely that during the period in analysis the diet of the south coast \n\npopulation had a relatively higher dominance of crustacean prey, those in turn recently fed \n\non lipid-rich plankton. \n\nAs in the squids Sepioteuthis lessoniana and Photololigo sp. (Semmens, 1998), or \n\nthe cuttlefish Sepia officinalis (Blanchier &amp; Boucaud-Camou, 1984), the lipid class \n\ncontents in the digestive gland do not correlate directly with the lipid contents of the \n\noocytes in the gonad, especially for total lipid content, triacylglycerol and phospholipids \n\n(see Figure3.8).The lipid class contents of the digestive gland of mature females shows \n\nsignificant differences between regions but this regional difference is not found in the \n\ngonads of the same females, which seems to indicate that the factors triggering oocytes \n\n\n\n2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat \n\n \n\n72 \n\n \n\nmaturity are independent of the nutritional value of reserves, even though females \n\ngenerally reach maturity beyond the optimum body mass and independently of gonad size \n\n(Louren\u00e7o et al. 2012). As income breeders that channel the energy directly from food to \n\nthe gonad during maturation (Houston et al. 2006; Quetglas et al. 2011), the different \n\nlevels in triacylglycerol and cholesterol noted in the O. vulgaris digestive glands between \n\ngeographical areas should be expected to show in the gonads as a reflection of diet. Despite \n\nthat, only the gonad fatty acid profile presents significant differences related with both area \n\nand maturity stage evidencing that the composition changes as maturation progresses but \n\nalso that there are differences between areas at every stage of the process. The gonads of \n\nthe south coast are richer in PUFA and in MUFA and the gonads of the northwest coast are \n\nricher in SFA especially C16:0 and C18:0. Nevertheless, the differences found in the ratio \n\nDHA/EPA between areas are marginally insignificant (t = -1.86, df = 18, p-value = 0.08), \n\nindicating a low impact of trophic habitat in the quality of oocytes. These results partially \n\nagree with the results obtained by Far\u00edas et al. (20115). In that study, the authors found a \n\ndirect effect of diet in the DHA/EPA ratio for the Patagonian red octopus Enteroctopus \n\nmegalocyathus, here, although FA profile in the gonads revealed different between areas, \n\nthe contents in DHA, EPA or DHA/EPA ratio are identical between the studied areas. \n\nIn conclusion, this study shows that, despite the variability observed in the stable \n\nisotopic signatures studied, ?\n15\n\nN signature in beaks is a valuable bio-indicator to follow the \n\ndiet history of different O. vulgaris populations, and the ?\n13\n\nC signature has potential to \n\nassess feeding behaviour changes related with maturity in O. vulgaris females. \n\nFurthermore, specific lipid classes as the triacylglycerol and the cholesterol and its content \n\nin the digestive gland can be used as indicators of their nutritional availability in the local \n\nhabitat. The fatty acid profile is a good indicator of both nutritional availability in the \n\nenvironment and also of gonads quality as shown by the main EFA content and the \n\nEPA/DHA ratio. The environmental availability of these EFA depends on seasonal cycles. \n\nUpwelling/downwelling events for example determine changes in the lipidic contents of \n\nthe plankton and in turn of the prey of octopus, as evidenced by the higher total lipids and \n\ncholesterol content in the digestive glands of the animals from the south coast. In spite of \n\ntheir characteristics as income breeders, it is difficult to observe a direct relationship \n\nbetween the lipid class contents in the digestive gland and in the gonad, suggesting that a   \n\nmeasure of regulation is exerted between food intake and oocyte formation.  \n\n \n\n\n\n2.

THE R\u00cdA DE VIGO OCTOPUS VULGARIS SPAWNING GROUND: LOCAL \nFACTORS INFLUENCING THE DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF \n\nPARALARVAE \n \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\nThe R\u00eda de Vigo (Southwestern Galicia) is an important spawning ground for the Octopus vulgaris \n\npopulation of the north-western Atlantic coast. The large-scale oceanographic conditions that are \n\nlinked to the abundance and distribution peaks of the paralarvae have been extensively discussed. \n\nNevertheless, the local micro-scale factors that favour the paralarvae concentration in R\u00eda de Vigo \n\nhave been less well studied. With this study, the correlation between local variables on O. vulgaris \n\nparalarvae abundance were analysed. The correlation of water column depth, distance from coast, \n\nand zone were analysed during the season of higher paralarvae abundance (the autumn). Our results \n\nhave shown that the depth of the water column and the distance to the coast have a significant \n\ncorrelation with the paralarvae abundance. The importance of those results is discussed under the \n\ninsight of the role of the R\u00eda de Vigo as an essential habitat for the O. vulgaris population of the \n\nnorthwestern Atlantic coast.    \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: spawning ground, paralarvae, local abundance.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile \n\n \n\n80 \n\n \n\n3.1.1. Introduction \n\nOctopus vulgaris is a neritic benthic species, common in the coastal waters between \n\nshore and approximately 100 m depth (Mangold, 1983). Its distribution extends to the edge \n\nof the continental shelf but most animals aggregate in the coastal waters at a relatively \n\nshort distance from the coastline (Quetglas et al., 2000). The paralarvae are pelagic from \n\nhatching to settlement (Villanueva &amp; Norman, 2008), and this transition to the juvenile \n\nbenthic life style depends biologically on feeding opportunities (energy input) and \n\nenvironmentally on the local temperature (Villanueva, 1995; Faure et al., 2000; Iglesias et \n\nal., 2004). The choice of the ground to settle depends of the dispersal of the paralarvae \n\nduring the pelagic phase, but bottoms of large grain sediments, namely gravel and coarse \n\nsand, and the proximity to rocky reefs appear to be beneficial to the juvenile and sub-adult \n\nrecruitment success (Katsanevakis &amp; Verriopoulos, 2004; Villanueva &amp; Norman, 2008; \n\nMoreno et al., 2014).  \n\nDifferent environmental factors (e.g. sea surface (SST) and bottom (SBT) \n\ntemperatures, depth, water-column stratification) have different impacts in O. vulgaris \n\nsurvival and growth. The level of impact depends of the life cycle stage following \n\nimportant shifts in each life cycle transition (see Robin et al., 2014 for a review in life \n\ncycle transitions). Nevertheless, in the case of O. vulgaris, the degree of influence of \n\nenvironmental (mainly oceanographic) conditions is considered to be higher during the \n\nparalarval stage affecting the present generation recruitment to fisheries (Otero et al., 2008; \n\nRoura et al., 2013). In the last fourteen years several studies have been conducted to \n\nunderstand the effect of the oceanographic parameters on the distribution and abundance of \n\nO. vulgaris paralarvae in the vicinities of important fishing areas. Those studies have been \n\ntargeting the effect of large and meso-scale indicators such as sea surface temperature \n\n(Demarcq &amp; Faure, 2000; Moreno et al., 2009) or coastal upwelling (Faure et al., 2000; \n\nGonzalez et al., 2005; Otero et al., 2008, 2009), but few have been conducted on the \n\nenvironmental conditions at the local scale as in situ temperature, water column \n\nstratification, bottom characteristics or distance to the coast line.  \n\nThe coastal areas, particularly those in the vicinity of important estuaries, or those \n\nfeaturing large inlets (e.g. Northwest Spanish coast) are considered important spawning \n\ngrounds and nurseries for most of the exploited marine fish and invertebrate species (Able, \n\n2005; Pallas et al., 2006; Vasconcelos et al., 2008; Morais et al., 2011). Larvae and \n\n\n\n3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile \n\n \n\n81 \n\n \n\njuvenile stages of several species grow in these areas to the adult stage, then often \n\nundergoing ontogenic migrations to different habitats (Able, 2005).  \n\nFor marine invertebrate species with complex life cycles, with pelagic phases that \n\ncarry out medium- or large-scale dispersion movements and benthic phases of limited \n\nmobility, the definition of nursery ground is more complex (Stoner, 2003; Pallas et al., \n\n2006). These species depend on larval dispersion to enhance survival and the definition of \n\na nursery ground should add temporal (e.g. season) and physical dimensions (e.g. \n\ntemperature, dispersion currents, water column stratification) to the spatial factors (e.g. \n\nsediments, depth).  \n\nShallow inlets such as the \"R\u00edas\" are structurally complex environments where many \n\nbiotic (e.g. predation, food availability) and abiotic factors (e.g. physical disturbance) \n\ndetermine habitat quality and generate different stress gradients that determine community \n\nstructure and population dynamics (Pallas et al., 2006). The most important stress \n\ngradients impact at the micro (meters) or meso-scales (hundreds of meters or kilometers) \n\nand as a response to this variability, benthic organisms might select their habitat to reduce \n\nthe trade-offs among different stress factors (Pallas et al., 2006).  \n\nThe identification of essential habitat (essential fish habitats, EFH) for O.vulgaris \n\nrequires knowledge about how environmental and biological factors affect the survival of \n\npre- and post-settlement juveniles both at the micro-scale and meso-scales (Moreno et al., \n\n2014). Considering this, the aim of this study is to assess the local effect of some factors \n\n(water column depth, zone and distance to coast) in the abundance of O. vulgaris \n\nparalarvae in the spawning grounds around the Cies Islands, in R\u00eda de Vigo.  \n\n \n\n3.1.2. Material and Methods \n\nTo determine Octopus vulgaris paralarvae abundance near the Cies islands, a survey \n\nwas conducted using a 750 mm diameter bongo net of 375 \u00b5m, equipped with a \n\nmechanical flowmeter (Figure 3.1). Sampling was conducted at night in four transects and \n\ntwo tows per transect at 2 knots. The tows were conducted during 20 min near surface \n\n(between 10 and 15 m depth) according to the depth strata of higher abundance of \n\nparalarvae (see Otero et al., 2009 and Roura, 2013 for methods).  \n\n\n\n3.

The scale bar corresponds to 3.5 km.  \n\n \n\nMean abundance (n/1000 m\n3\n) of O. vulgaris paralarvae were determine by transect \n\nand compared considering the factors transect water column depth (depth), distance to the \n\nCies Islands (dland) and sampling zone (zone). Sample abundance results were tested for \n\nthe assumptions of normality and homogeneity with Shapiro-Wilk\u2019s and Bartlett\u00b4s tests, \n\nrespectively. The main effects and interaction between the factors depth, dland and zone on \n\nthe mean abundance were determined by two-way ANOVA with permutation test, re-\n\nsampling the original data 10 times to generate a sampling distribution F against which to \n\ntest H0 and obtain a probability measure. The hypothesis for the two-way ANOVA was that \n\nthere is no main effect of depth, dland and zone and no interaction effect of depth \u00d7 dland, \n\ndepth \u00d7 zone and dland \u00d7 zone on paralarval mean abundance. The existence of \n\ncollinearity between factors was assessed by determining the spearman correlation index \n\n(rspearman), assuming that two factors were collinear when rspearman was significantly higher \n\nthan 0.90.  \n\n \n\n3.1.3.

Higher paralarval abundance was observed in station inn_1 in the \n\ninner zone (19.73 \u00b1 4.32 n/1000\n \nm\n\n3\n ) followed by station out_2 close to the outside part of \n\n\n\n3.

The lower average abundance occurs in the more distant \n\ntransect of outer zone, out_1 with 0.92 \u00b1 1.30 n/1000\n3\n. \n\nDespite the differences found, there is no statistical evidence that the outer zone and \n\nthe inner zone present significantly different levels of paralarval abundance (Table 3.2). \n\nThe transects both sides of the Cies islands presented higher abundances than the more \n\ndistant transects (out_2 and inn_1 transects) (Table 3.1), this relationship observed between \n\nthe average abundance of paralarvae and the vicinity of the Cies Islands is proved with the \n\nANOVA results for the factor dland in Table 3.2. \n\nThe shallower transects (out_2 and inn_1) were the ones where paralarval average \n\nabundance was higher. Those differences were confirmed by the ANOVA results, \n\npresenting statistical differences between transects with different water column depths. It is \n\nimportant to note here that the factors dland and depth are not collinear (rspearman= 0.44, p-\n\nvalue = 0.27).  \n\nTable 3.1 - Stations geographic position, zone, depth and distance to the Cies Island and Octopus vulgaris \n\nparalarvae mean abundance determined by station.

Discussion \n\nThe analysis conducted here showed that additionally to SST, physical disturbance or \n\nproductivity, there are local factors as the water column depth and the distance to the coast \n\nthat have an important effect in the distribution and abundance of paralarvae, at least at the \n\nlocal scale. \n\nAll of the paralarvae captured here and the majority of the paralarvae captured in \n\nprevious studies conducted in the same study area (Gonzalez et al., 2005; Roura, 2013) \n\nshow 3 suckers on the arms and weigh on average 2.5 mg indicating that they are newly \n\nhatched (Villanueva 1995; Villanueva &amp; Norman, 2008; Roura, 2013) and confirming this \n\narea as a spawning ground. During the autumn hatch peak (our sampling season), Roura \n\n(2013) described the dispersion mechanism of paralarvae from this area. According to his \n\n\n\n3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile \n\n \n\n85 \n\n \n\nwork, during September/October upwelling conditions, the paralarvae concentrate in the \n\nsurface waters and are washed out from the inlet due to the offshore currents. This is, \n\nprobably, the mechanism responsible for \u201cfeeding\u201d up some of the winter juvenile (pre-\n\nrecruits) grounds identified by Moreno et al. (2014). \n\n According to Villanueva &amp; Norman (2008) most benthic octopus species with \n\npelagic paralarvae spawn in shallow rocky or coral substratum areas, and consequently \n\ntheir hatchlings are more abundant near the coastline. \n\n This link between important spawning grounds, feeding grounds (or nurseries) and \n\nfavorable transport conditions was also identified by Garofalo et al. (2010) for the O. \n\nvulgaris population of the Strait of Sicily. There, the spatial distribution of the O. vulgaris \n\nspawning grounds and nurseries is controlled by the meso-scale eddies that favor the \n\nmigration of the paralarvae to south-western feeding grounds. The circulation is further \n\nmodified by the formation of meso-scale eddies, which appear to control the spatial \n\ndistribution of the spawning and nursery grounds of O. vulgaris in the strait of Sicily. \n\nSpawning octopuses concentrate in the northern and central sectors of the Strait of Sicily at \n\nthe margin of fronts or eddies, the presence of which favors larval retention and benthic \n\nsettlement, promoting the formation of nursery areas close to the spawning grounds \n\n(Garofalo et al., 2010). \n\nIn the present study, we show that the Cies Islands influence the abundance of the \n\nparalarvae inside the R\u00eda de Vigo system. The Cies Islands possibly act as a barrier and \n\nprotection for the O. vulgaris breeding females and consequentially for the newly hatched \n\nparalarvae wich have limited swimming capacity. Here, the paralarvae start to feed mainly \n\nof zoeae (Roura et al., 2012) of decapod species of the families Paguridae, Palaemonidae \n\nand Procellanidae which live in these shallow inlets (Lindley, 1982; Sampedro et al., 1997; \n\nVald\u00e9s et al., 2007). \n\nThe functional role of the R\u00eda de Vigo as a nursery is not fully understood because \n\nfew or no paralarvae with more than 3 suckers per arm (sucker number at hatching, \n\nVillanueva, 1995) have been found in the several studies conducted until now. \n\nNevertheless, there is evidence (Guerra pers comm) of mature females looking for shallow \n\ngrounds in the surroundings of the Cies Islands to spawn. Furthermore, Otero et al. (2008) \n\nand Roura et al. (2013) found out that the local environmental conditions as wind stress \n\nand the strength of downwelling/upwelling events prior and during hatch in this region \n\nhighly explains the abundance and biomass paralarvae abundance and particularly the \n\n\n\n3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile \n\n \n\n86 \n\n \n\nyear-to-year variability of the adult catches for the entire Galician coast. Additionally, \n\ncomparing the studies conducted by Moreno et al. (2009) and by Roura (2013), the \n\nabundances obtained by the latter for the R\u00eda de Vigo (a maximum abundance of in Out_2 \n\ntransect of 395 n/1000\n3\n m in 2008) seem to be higher than the abundances estimates \n\nobtained by the former for the entire portuguese coast (maximum abundance in autum in \n\nthe north coast of 6 n/100\n3\n) for a 18 years survey data.  \n\nAlthough oceanic features appear to be the main driving forces that explain why R\u00edas \n\nBaixas is an important spawning ground, this preliminary study showed that at the local \n\nlevel other factors determine the abundance of newly hatched O. vulgaris and these may \n\nalso contribute to explain why this area can be considered an EFH to the Northwestern \n\nAtlantic coastal population of O. vulgaris. \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n\nThe author wants to acknowledge the help ofthe crew of RV \"Mytilus\", Alvaro Roura and Marcos Regueira \n\nwhile conducting zooplankton surveys.

Unfed hatchlings of O. vulgaris were directly \n\ncollected by scuba diving from wild ripe eggs in the R\u00eda de Vigo in R\u00edas Baixas. At the same time, \n\nplankton samples were collected in the same area to capture wild paralarvae and their potential \n\nprey. The calorimetric analytical methods were used to assess the nutritional quality \n\n(carbohydrates, proteins and lipid classes content) of unfed hatchlings, planktonic paralarvae and \n\ntheir potential prey aiming to interpret the nutritional requirements of Octopus vulgaris paralarvae. \n\nMultivariate analyses show that O. vulgaris hatchlings are richer in carbohydrates (and glycogen), \n\nproteins, total lipids, cholesterol and phospholipids although maintaining the protein:lipid ratio of \n\ntheir potential prey. The fatty acids (FA) content was also determined and compared between unfed \n\nhatchlings, planktonic paralarvae and potential prey to understand if there specific FA were \n\nincorporated by the planktonic O. vulgaris through their diet. There are differences in the n-3 \n\nHighly Unsaturated Fatty Acids (HUFA) content, with mesozooplankton samples being richer in \n\nC22:6n3 (EPA), poorer in C20:5n3 (DHA) and also in C20:4n6 (ARA) than hatchlings and \n\nparalarvae. The planktonic paralarvae have an FA profile markedly different from that of the \n\nhatchlings and mesozooplankton, being particularly rich in C16:1n7, C18:1n9 and ARA, \n\nevidencing their capability to biosynthesizing Polyunsaturated FA (PUFA). Considering that few \n\ndays of life separate the O. vulgaris hatchlings from the planktonic paralarvae, the observed \n\nchanges in O. vulgaris FA profile occur in a relative small step of time, thus showing that their \n\nnatural prey greatly influence specific FA enrichment. This kind of selective enrichment could be \n\ncarried out under culture conditions in order to enhance survival during the first critical days. \n\nKeywords: Octopus vulgaris, paralarvae, prey, fatty acids, diet profile. \n\n                                                        \n3\n Submitted to the Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology. \n\n\n\n3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile \n\n \n\n90 \n\n \n\n3.2.1. Introduction \n\nThe common octopus, Octopus vulgaris, is an important resource for the artisanal \n\nand industrial fisheries in the Atlantic margin of the Iberian peninsula, with official average \n\nannual landings of 9185 tons in Portugal (INE, 2013) and 4000 tons in Galicia (Gonzalez \n\net al., 2005). In 2011, the Portuguese artisanal fleet was responsible for 95 % of the \n\ncommon octopus landings in this country (ICES, 2011). Landings statistics also show the \n\nincreasing importance of common octopus in catches of the trawling fleet in recent years \n\n(ICES, 2012; Fonseca et al., 2008; Pilar-Fonseca et al., 2014). O. vulgaris is also \n\nconsidered one of the species with most aquaculture production potential due to its high \n\ngrowth and high food convertion rates (Vaz-Pinto et al., 2004). Nevertheless, there is a \n\nbottleneck in the transfer of knowledge to an industrial scale  because of the high mortality \n\nrates prior to settlement in captivity, even after the cycle has been closed. This is believed \n\nto be due to feeding and nutritional constrains at the paralarval stage (Iglesias et al., 2007).     \n\nO. vulgaris is defined as an \u201cr\u201d life-history strategy organism with the production of \n\nnumerous small eggs that hatch into pelagic paralarvae (although not strictly, due to the \n\nmaternal egg care). The factors responsible for the recruitment success in cephalopods are \n\nmost dependent on the interaction between egg masses, hatchling and pre-recruit juveniles \n\nand the physical and biological environment prevailing during each phase (Gonzalez et al., \n\n2005); sea temperature playing an important role (Forsythe, 2004). In the north-east \n\nAtlantic, the O. vulgaris population is characterized by a bimodal life cycle with an \n\nextended reproduction phase with two spawning peaks, one in early spring and another in \n\nlate summer (Otero et al., 2007; Louren\u00e7o et al., 2012) resulting in two hatching peaks in \n\nJuly and September/October (Gonzalez et al., 2005; Moreno et al., 2009) and two \n\nrecruitment peaks in coastal areas (Demarcq &amp; Faure, 2000) linked with the seasonality \n\nand strength of the seasonal coastal upwelling of the Western Iberia (Demarcq &amp; Faure, \n\n2000; Otero et al., 2008, 2009).  \n\nThe Iberian Atlantic coast is known as a hatchery and nursery area for Octopus \n\nvulgaris (Moreno et al., 2014), and the R\u00edas Baixas in the Galician coast are believed to be \n\nparticularly important (Otero et al, 2008). Here as in the coastal waters, the dynamics of \n\nthe coastal upwelling/downwelling events favours the cross-shelf dispersion of O. vulgaris \n\nparalarvae (Moreno et al., 2009; Roura, 2013). After hatching, O. vulgaris paralarvae \n\nremain pelagic for 2 to 4 months, depending on the temperature, contributing to the \n\nmesozooplankton community (Villanueva, 1995; Demarcq &amp; Faure, 2000; Katsanevakis &amp; \n\n\n\n3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile \n\n \n\n91 \n\n \n\nVerriopoulos, 2006). In the first days of life, O. vulgaris paralarvae combine endogenous \n\n(yolk) with exogenous (prey) feeding (Villanueva &amp; Norman, 2008). Using molecular \n\nmethods, Roura et al. (2012) concluded that the main preys of O. vulgaris paralarvae, at \n\nleast in this region, are larval stages of decapods of the families Crangonidae, Alpheidae, \n\nBrachyura, Paguridae, Thalassinidae and Porcellanidae, followed by euphausiids and fish \n\nlarvae (Roura et al., 2012). With the exception to the euphausiids, all the species detected \n\ncontributed less than 4,3 % to the abundance of the mesozooplanktonic community in this \n\nregion, suggesting that O. vulgaris paralarvae are specialist predators in the wild (Roura et \n\nal., 2012).  \n\nThe mesozooplankton community is a key component of the coastal ecosystems, \n\nlinking the microbial food web to the macrozooplankton and neritic food webs. In the R\u00edas \n\nBaixas (Galicia), the mesozooplankton community is closely linked to the \n\nupwelling/downwelling events associated to the Western Iberian Upwelling System, where \n\nprimary production is increased by wind-driven currents that bring nutrient-rich sub-\n\nsurface water up into the photic layer during the spring/summer coastal upwelling events \n\n(Relvas et al., 2007; \u00c1lvarez-Salgado et al., 2009). In this region Roura et al. (2013) \n\nidentified 3 mesozooplankton communities following the bathymetric gradient, named as \n\ncoastal, frontal and oceanic. These communities differed in both species composition and \n\nabundance, and are influenced by the regional meteorology and hydrography.    \n\nDespite the extended knowledge about the environmental physical factors that drive \n\nthe distribution, abundance and recruitment success of O. vulgaris paralarvae (Gonz\u00e1lez et \n\nal., 2005; Otero et al., 2008, 2009; Moreno et al., 2009; Roura 2013), there is a gap in \n\nstudies regarding the feeding requirements of wild O. vulgaris paralarvae and the \n\nnutritional profile of their natural preys. The studies conducted to date were undertaken on \n\nreared eggs and individuals in captivity, showing that an O. vulgaris paralarva weighs \n\nabout 1.4 mg at hatching with approximatelly 80% of water (Navarro &amp; Villanueva, 2003; \n\nVillanueva, 1995) and protein (between 46 % and 69 % of the dry weight). Lipid classes \n\nare minor nutrients accounting for 12 % of the paralarva dry weight, mainly cholesterol \n\nand polar lipids (phospholipids) (Navarro &amp; Villanueva, 2003; Villanueva et al., 2004).  \n\nAccordingly, our study aims to identify the composition profiles of O. vulgaris \n\nparalarvae collected from wild ripe eggs (unfed hatchlings) and the nutritional profiles of \n\ntheir potential preys present in the mesozooplankton (species bigger than 1 mm) of the R\u00eda \n\nde Vigo. The profiles were assessed in terms of lipid classes (phospholipids, cholesterol, \n\ntriacylglycerol, wax esters and fatty acids profile), proteins, carbohydrates and glycogen \n\n\n\n3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile \n\n \n\n92 \n\n \n\ncontent. Condition indices and trophic markers based in the protein, lipids and fatty acids \n\n(FA) classes (Saturated, Polyunsaturated, PUFA and Highly Unsaturated) were determined \n\nand compared between potential preys and O. vulgaris hatchlings to understand the \n\nnutritional requirements of the paralarvae. Additionally, we follow the variation in the FA \n\nprofile between unfed hatchlings and older paralarvae aiming to understand which FA were \n\nincorporated into planktonic O. vulgaris hatchlings through their diet, in order to \n\nunderstand their nutritional requirements for aquaculture.  \n\n \n\n3.2.2. Material and Methods \n\n3.2.2.1.  Zooplankton sampling \n\nMesozooplankton samples were collected at the surface (5 m depth) with a \n\nmultitrawl (MultiNet\u00ae) sampler (0.71 \u00d7 0.71 m opening frame, 200 \u00b5m mesh) in three \n\nsurveys conducted under the LARECO project (CTM2011-25929) in autumn 2012 \n\n(September 17th, October 1st and 5th) in the outer part of R\u00eda de Vigo (Figure 3.3). \n\nSamples were collected east (inner sample) and west of Cies Islands (outer sample). \n\nZooplankton samples were visually examined on board, looking for Octopus vulgaris \n\nparalarvae. Up to 40 O. vulgaris paralarvae were found and stored at -80\u00baC in a solution of \n\nMethanol: Dicloromethane (2:1) solution for analytical purposes. Samples with paralarvae \n\nwere split into two subsamples. One was washed with sea water and filtered through a \n\n1000 \u00b5m sieve to retain individuals larger than 1000 \u00b5m (considered hereafter as the \n\npotential prey of O. vulgaris paralarvae), frozen at -80\u00baC, freeze dried for 48 h and stored \n\nagain at -80\u00baC for further analysis. The second subsample was stored in 70% ethanol and \n\nused to identify the mesozooplankton community accompanying the paralarvae. Organisms \n\nwere identified under a binocular (Nikon SMZ800) or inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse \n\nTS100) to the lowest possible taxonomic level. To determine the base biochemical profile \n\nof the O. vulgaris paralarvae, newly hatched paralarvae were obtained from ripe eggs \n\ncollected by scuba diving in October 9\nth\n\n 2012 off the R\u00eda de Vigo (site coordinates: \n\n42\u00ba14\u2019N, 8\u00ba 54\u2019W) (Figure 3.3). The hatchlings were counted and pooled in three samples \n\nfor biochemical analysis. \n\n \n\n\n\n3.

Biochemical methods \n\nProteins, carbohydrates, total lipids and the lipid classes phospholipids (phos), wax \n\nesters (wax), cholesterol (chol), triacylglycerol (tag), free fatty acids (ffa) and fatty acids \n\n(FA) were determined from the samples.  \n\nThe protein content was determineded through the method of Lowry et al. (1951) \n\nafter alkaline hydrolysis with 0.5 N NaOH at 30\u00b0C for 24 h. Bovine albumin (Sigma), \n\nwhich underwent the same treatment as samples, was used as a standard.  \n\nCarbohydrates were quantified according to the phenolsulphuric acid method \n\n(Strickland and Parsons, 1968) using glucose as the standard. Glycogen was quantifieded \n\nthrough the same assay as carbohydrates, after sample precipitation with 100 % ethanol.  \n\nLipids were first extracted with chloroform:methanol (1:2) and after centrifugation, \n\nthe precipitate was re-extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1). Both supernatants were \n\nsubsequently washed with chloroform:methanol:water (8:4:3) as described by Fern\u00e1ndez-\n\nReiriz et al. (1989). Total lipids were quantified following the method described by Marsh \n\n&amp; Weinstein (1966) with a tripalmitine standard (Sigma Aldrich Inc., Buchs, Switzerland). \n\nLipid classes were studied by thin-layer chromatography (TLC)/densitometry. Silica gel 60 \n\nW plates (Merck 16486) of 20 \u00d7 20 cm by 0.25 mm in thickness, were used. Samples were \n\n\n\n3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile \n\n \n\n94 \n\n \n\napplied by an automatic TLC sampler (Camag 27220). The chromatographic stain was \n\nmade according to Freeman &amp; West (1966). The plates were stained with a 10% CuSO4 \n\nsolution in 0.85% H3PO4 by heating to 180\u00baC (Bitman &amp; Wood, 1982). Standards \n\nemployed for the quantitative analysis of the sterol and waxes esters, sterols, free fatty \n\nacids and triacylglicerol were cholesterol, palmitate, cholesterol, palmitic acid and cod \n\nliver (CLO, Sigma), respectively. A standard obtained from a natural sample was used for \n\nphos. The plates were scanned with a Shimadzu CS9000 densitometer, using a \n\nmonochromatic 370 nm beam of 0.4 \u00d7 0.4 mm working in the zigzag mode, reading the \n\nwhole spot, and with automatic autozero for baseline correction. All solvents, reagents and \n\nfatty acid standards used in this work were of analytic grade (Merck, Darmstadt, and \n\nSigma). \n\nThe results of the biochemical analyses, expressed in units of weight per individual, \n\nwere transformed into their energy equivalents using the following factors: 18, 17.2 and 35 \n\nKJ/g for protein, carbohydrates and lipids, respectively, based on Beukema &amp; De Bruin \n\n(1979). \n\nThe FA composition of the total lipid fraction was determined converting total \n\nlipids into FA methyl esters, according to the method described by Lepage &amp; Roy (1984). \n\nFatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were analysed by gas chromatography. Peaks \n\ncorresponding to FAME were identified by comparison of their retention times with \n\nstandard mixtures. Peak areas were automatically integrated with C19:0 being used as an \n\ninternal standard for quantitative analysis. The concentration of each fatty acid or fatty acid \n\ngroup was expressed as g/100g total FAME. \n\nNutrient and FA ratios are used as biomarkers of condition (Shulman &amp; Love, \n\n1999) and represent the trophic position or dietary quality of a species population (e.g. El-\n\nSabaawi et al., 2008). The content in saturated FA (SFA), Monounsaturated FA (MUFA), \n\npolyunsaturated FA (PUFA) including n-3 Highly Unsaturated (n-3 HUFA), n-6 HUFA, \n\nDocosahexaenoic acid C22:6n3 (DHA), Eicosapenteonoic acid C22:6n3 (EPA) and \n\nArachidonic acid C20:4n6 (ARA) are particularly important to determine biomarkers of \n\ncondition. Here were determined the protein:lipid, tag:lipid, n-3 HUFA:n-6 HUFA, \n\nSFA:PUFA; DHA:EPA and the DHA:ARA ratios for mesozooplankton and O. vulgaris \n\nhatchlings and paralarvae. Although the number of wild O. vulgaris paralarvae collected \n\nform the zooplankton samples was apparently high (n=40), their low weight prevented us \n\nfrom carrying the whole biochemical analyses and only FA profiles could be obtained. \n\n\n\n3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile \n\n \n\n95 \n\n \n\n3.2.2.3. Statistical analysis \n\nThe species composition and abundance of zooplankton samples, macronutrients, \n\nlipid classes and FA profiles were analysed using metric multidimensional techniques. \n\nPrior to analysis, the zooplankton database was log (x+1) transformed and screened to \n\nselect those taxa that appeared in at least 10% of the samples. A zooplankton dissimilarity \n\nmatrix was calculated using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index (Zuur et al., 2007) and \n\nanalysed with principal coordinate analysis (PCO). The dimensions (axes) eigenvalues and \n\nspecies scores in each dimension of a full model were used to reduce the matrix size to the \n\nspecies that most correlate with the PCO axes in a reduced model (Table 3.3). The \n\nmacronutrients and lipid classes content dataset was normalized according to Zuur et al. \n\n(2007). The similarity matrix was calculated based in the Euclidean distance matrix (Zuur \n\net al., 2007) and analyzed with principal component analysis (PCA). The groups separated \n\nby PCA were tested for differences related with sampling area and species composition by \n\nnon-parametric permutational ANOVA (PERMANOVA).  \n\nThe FA profile database was screened to select the major FA (of which the mean \n\ncontent is > 1g/100g FAME) and data were normalized according to Zuur et al. (2007). \n\nThe FA similarity matrix was calculated based in the Euclidean distance matrix (Zuur et \n\nal., 2007) and further analyzed with PCA. The dimension (axes) eigenvalues and FA scores \n\nin each dimension of the full model were used to reduce the FA matrix size to the FA that \n\nexplain most of the variance in a reduced model (Table 3.3). Both zooplankton species and \n\nFA profile reduced models were tested for differences related with sampling area and \n\nspecies composition by non-parametric permutational ANOVA (PERMANOVA) \n\nconsidering type I errors.  \n\nA constrained canonical analysis (CCA) was applied to the zooplankton reduced \n\nmodel using the macronutrients, lipid classes and FA as explanatory variables to identify \n\nsignificant correlations between the content of those nutrients and the zooplankton species \n\ncomposition and abundance in each sample. The CCA was conducted on the site scores of \n\nthe species composition reduced model, applying the macro-nutrients and lipid classes \n\ncontent as explanatory variables in the nutrients model; and the FA's content as explanatory \n\nvariables for the FA model. The analysis was conducted applying the \u201cenvfit\u201d function of \n\nthe VEGAN package in R (Oksanen et al., 2013). \n\nThe macronutrients, lipid classes and FA profile of zooplankton and O. vulgaris \n\nparalarvae (unfed hatchlings and feeding paralarvae) were compared using PCA to \n\n\n\n3.

Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile \n\n \n\n97 \n\n \n\n3.2.3. Results \n\nSpecific composition of the zooplankton with size > 1 mm (Table 3.4) showed a \n\ndominance of holoplankton species both in the inner zone (67.65 %) and the outer zone \n\n(83.61%) with the copepods Paracalanus parvus and Acartia clausii, and the euphausid \n\nNyctiphanes couchii being the most frequent species. The meroplankton species \n\ncontributed with 32.35 % in the inner zone and 16.39 % in the outer zone, with the most \n\nfrequent larvae being cirripids and brachyuran zoeae, mainly in the inner zone stations. The \n\nmean holo/meroplankton ratio of the > 1 mm fraction of the zooplanktonic community \n\nranged between 2.12 in the inner zone and 6.33 in the outer zone indicating that the two \n\nsampling groups belong to the same coastal community. The similarity observed between \n\ninner and outer zone groups was confirmed by the PERMANOVA for differences between \n\nsampling zone (F = 1.57, p-value 0.25, 199 perm). Although differences between areas \n\nwere not significant, the PCO on the zooplankton reduced model allowed the samples to be \n\nseparated considering the presence and abundance of species in two different groups: the \n\ncopepod group that aggregates the samples dominated by the copepods species (samples \n\nout_d1, out_d2 and inn_d2); and the zoeae group which aggregates the samples for which \n\nthe larval stages of crustacean, Cnidaria and Siphonophora and the copepod Temora \n\nlongicornis are the most important species (samples inn_d1, inn_d3 and out_d3) (Figure \n\n3.4, zooplankton reduced model).  \n\nThe zooplankton samples are rich in protein and total lipids, with a Protein: Lipid \n\nratio of 2.99. Lipids are the second most abundant nutrient and an important energy source \n\n(7.50 KJ/g) (Table 3.5 - Macronutrient composition and energy content of the zooplankton samples and \n\nOctopus vulgaris hatchlings. Different superscripts indicate significant statistical differences (p &lt;0.05) \n\nbetween studied groups. * indicates a significance level of  p &lt;0.05 between groups;  ** indicates a \n\nsignificance level of  p &lt;0.01.), with tag being the most abundant lipid class, followed by the \n\nffa and waxes (Figure 3.5). Individual FA average concentration (g/100g FAME \u00b1 SD) \n\nobtained by GC are presented in Table 3.6. The zooplankton fatty acids profile was \n\nanalysed with PCA and results show that the first and second dimensions explained 81% of \n\nvariation due to the Myristic acid C14:0, Palmitic acid C16:0, Palmitoleic acid C16:1n7, \n\nMargaric acid C17:0, C17:1 and Vaccenic acid C18:1n7 variation between groups (Table \n\n3.3).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n3.

For the lipid classes\u2019 content, O. vulgaris hatchlings are rich in \n\nphospholipids and fatty acids, followed by cholesterol and a very low content in ffa. No tag \n\nand waxes esters were detected (Figure 3.5). \n\nBoth macronutrients and lipid classes content are statistically different between \n\nzooplankton samples and hatchlings with the latter being richer in carbohydrates (and \n\nglycogen), proteins, total lipids, chol and phos (Table 3.5, Figure 3.5). PCA shows that the \n\ndifferent macronutrients and lipid classes content allow zooplankton samples to be \n\nseparated from O. vulgaris hatchlings, explaining 92 % of the model variation (Figure 3.6: \n\nnutrients model) further supported by PERMANOVA (F = 8.86, p-value = 0.025, 199 \n\nperm).

The overall FA profile is significantly different when comparing zooplankton \n\nsamples and O. vulgaris hatchlings (PERMANOVA, F = 266.79, p-value = 0.03, 199 \n\nperm).

The ratio n-3 HUFA: n-6 HUFA is twice as large in the zooplankton community \n\nthan in O. vulgaris hatchlings, which influences in the same degree the DHA: ARA ratio. \n\nO. vulgaris hatchlings are richer in DHA in comparison with the EPA content (DHA: EPA \n\nratio > 1) (Table 3.7). Those conditions indices and trophic markers were compared with \n\nthe nutrients (macro-nutrients and lipid classes) and with the fatty acid profile of \n\nzooplankton samples and O. vulgaris hatchlings as explanatory variables of the observed \n\nfatty acid profile. Results show that those can be used to differentiate between samples \n\n(Figure 3.6), particularly the tag content, n-3HUFA: n-6HUFA, DHA: EPA and DHA: ARA \n\n(blue arrows in Figure 3.6 FA model) and tag content (blue arrow Figure 3.6 nutrients \n\nmodel).  \n\nTable 3.6 presents the fatty acids profile identified in the sample of 40 O. vulgaris \n\nparalarvae collected from the plankton.

Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile \n\n \n\n104 \n\n \n\nnoteworthy that C16:1n7 and C18:1n9 content is particularly high in the paralarvae in \n\ncomparison both with the hatchlings and the zooplankton samples. The ARA content is \n\nidentical in both hatchlings and paralarvae and higher than in the zooplankton samples. \n\nThe DHA content of paralarvae is identical to that of the zooplankton and lower to that of \n\nthe hatchlings. EPA content in wild paralarvae is particularly low in comparison with the \n\nother groups (Table 3.6). Overall, planktonic O. vulgaris have increased concentrations of \n\nMUFAs and lower concentrations of PUFAs when compared with the hatchlings. The PCA \n\nreflects those differences separating the planktonic paralarvae from hatchlings and \n\nzooplankton samples, mainly based in the differences in the content of Oleic acid (Figure \n\n3.7). The PERMANOVA results showed that the FA profile is different between these three \n\ngroups in terms of both FA identified and FA content (F = 119.5, p-value = 0.005, 199 \n\nperm). The trophic markers (blue arrows in the Figure 3.7 biplot) are highly correlated with \n\naxis 1 (95 % explained variation), indicating that differences found in these trophic \n\nmarkers ratios are more significant between O. vulgaris samples and mesozooplankton \n\nsamples than between hatchlings and feeding paralarvae.  \n\n \n\nTable 3.7 -  Mean (\u00b1 SD) condition and trophic indicators determined for the mesozooplankton and Octopus  \n\nvulgaris hatchlings in the present study in comparison with the results for other potential preys and benthic \n\noctopus paralarvae obtained in recent octopus paralarvae feeding studies (Navarro and  Villanueva, 2000; \n\nUriarte et al., 2011; Couto, 2012; Iglesias et al 2013).

Discussion \n\nThe zooplankton species identified represent a small time and size window of the \n\nmesozooplankton community of the R\u00eda de Vigo during the season of higher O. vulgaris \n\nabundance. In the western Iberian Atlantic coast, O. vulgaris paralarvae hatch \n\npreferentially in September/October in synchrony with the higher levels of food and energy \n\navailability as a result of the previous spring/ summer upwelling (Gonzalez et al., 2005). \n\nO. vulgaris paralarvae start to feed from some hours to a few days after hatching \n\n(Villanueva et al., 1996; Roura et al., 2012), hunting preferentially on crustacean species \n\nlarger than 1mm in length, which coincides with observations documented in captivity (e.g. \n\nVillanueva et al., 1996; Hern\u00e1ndez-Garc\u00eda et al., 2000, Iglesias et al., 2006; Roura et al., \n\n2010). Accordingly, we analysed as potential prey for O. vulgaris only the zooplankton \n\nspecies that were larger than 1 mm. It included a heterogeneous assemblage of organisms \n\nsuch as cnidarians, appendicularians, siphonophores, crustaceans, chaetognaths, \n\npolychaetes, echinoderms and fish larvae. Although O. vulgaris paralarvae appear to be \n\nspecialist predators feeding preferentially on decapod crab larvae (Roura et al., 2012), we \n\n\n\n3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile \n\n \n\n106 \n\n \n\nincluded the entire zooplankton assemblage to understand what was the nutritional profile \n\nof the community. \n\nOur samples were dominated by two copepods Paracalanus parvus and Acartia \n\nclausi, the euphausiid Nyctiphanes couchii, chaetognaths and small Tunicata (see Table \n\n3.4). In spite of their abundance, copepods were not detected in the gut contents of the \n\nearly stages of octopus (Roura et al., 2012), but these organisms may constitute an \n\nimportant part of the diet of the paralarvae later in their planktonic stage (Roura et al., \n\n2013), as studies in captivity show that O. vulgaris feds on copepod species in absence of \n\nother preys (Iglesias et al., 2007). Additionally, the identification of the species \n\ncomposition in our samples linked with the FA profile, permitted the identification of the \n\nsource of some of the most limiting FA for the optimal growth of O. vulgaris paralarvae \n\nsuch as DHA (Monroig et al., 2012a) which is biosynthesized by the more abundant \n\ncopepod species (Dalsgaard et al., 2003; Berg\u00e9 &amp; Barnathan, 2005).  \n\nThe lipid classes content in the zooplankton community denotes a rich source of \n\nphospholipids and free FA that can be easily incorporated by the O. vulgaris paralarvae and \n\nfuel their high growth rates. Furthermore, this earlier autumn zooplankton community is \n\nricher in tag than wax esters, which is characteristic of a community that experienced a \n\npeak of food availability (phytoplankton) (Lee et al., 2006). The higher content in tag \n\nrelatively to wax esters is also related with the increasing presence of the meroplankton \n\nspecies in some samples, particularly cirripedes and brachyuran larvae that are known to \n\nstore tag in large lipid globules (Lee et al., 2006), in opposition to the copepod dominated \n\nsamples richer in wax esters from PUFA (Lee et al., 1970, 1971). \n\n  The zooplankton community FA profile showed a dominance of the saturated FA \n\n(SFA) and the polyunsaturated FA (PUFA). This is related with the dominance of calanoid \n\ncopepod species but also due to the sampling season. In this season there is a higher \n\navailability of bacteria, detritus and green algae in the water which are richer in short-chain \n\nSFA (Falk-Petersen et al., 2002) ando n which the zooplankton feeds, influencing the high \n\ncontent in SFA (~ 30%) and PUFA (~ 49 %) (Falk-Petersen et al., 2002; Gon\u00e7alves et al., \n\n2012). \n\nThe biochemical profile and nutritional ratios determined for O. vulgaris hatchlings \n\nallowed predicting the nutritional requirements during the paralarval stage (Sargent et al., \n\n1999). O. vulgaris hatchlings collected here are particularly rich in carbohydrates (and \n\nglycogen), proteins and phos, with proteins comprising the major energy source for \n\n\n\n3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile \n\n \n\n107 \n\n \n\nhatchlings individually (see Table 3.5 and Figure 3.5). Navarro and Villanueva (2000, \n\n2003) already showed that newly hatched and older O. vulgaris paralarvae in captivity,  are \n\nrelatively low in lipid contents with relatively large phos and chol fractions and small lipid \n\nreserves (e.g. tag). Other early stages of cephalopod species such as Galiteuthis glacialis \n\nshow the same pattern (Piatkowski &amp; Hagen, 1994). \n\nOn the other hand, these O. vulgaris hatchlings depend on the inner yolk rich in \n\nlipoproteins to survive through the first hours of life (Boletzky, 2003; Lee, 1991; \n\nVillanueva &amp; Norman, 2008). The digestive gland is not fully developed (Moguel et al., \n\n2010) and paralarvae get energy from the lipoproteic yolk rich in phosp and chol (Lee, \n\n1991) which explains the relatively high content of those nutrients. Tag and waxes are only \n\nvestigial in content and were not quantified by the method employed. We believe that tag \n\nand waxes had been greatly consumed due to stress during collection as at least tag should \n\nbe expected as a natural low percentage reserve of mature O. vulgaris females (Louren\u00e7o \n\net al., 2014). \n\nAccordingly to Iglesias et al. (2013) wild zooplankton populations in general, present \n\nthe suitable biochemical composition for the diet of O. vulgaris paralarvae, presenting \n\nlower levels of total lipids, phos and tag, and higher percentage of PUFAs (DHA and EPA). \n\nHere, it is important to note that potential prey and hatchlings present identical Protein/ \n\nLipid ratios. On the other hand, the differences found in the trophic ratios such as n-\n\n3HUFA/n-6HUFA, DHA/ARA and DHA/EPA found between potential preys and O. \n\nvulgaris hatchlings are small but significant as they allow differentiating between the two \n\ngroups.  \n\nNotwithstanding being a single pooled sample, this is the first time that the FA \n\nprofile of wild planktonic O. vulgaris paralarvae is determined. Keep in mind the \n\npreliminary characteristics of these results, the FA profile of these paralarvae shows some \n\nparticular aspects when compared with the hatchlings and the zooplankton groups. \n\nCompared with the O. vulgaris hatchlings and paralarvae present higher content in C16:0, \n\nC18:0, C16:1n7 and C18:1n9. This relative enrichment is related with their diet which \n\nincludes herbivorous species such as decapod zoeae and other omnivorous and carnivorous \n\nholo and meroplankton species (responsible for the denaturation of PUFA and MUFA into \n\nSFA) (Dalsgaard et al., 2003; Berg\u00e9 &amp; Barnathan, 2005). On the other hand, the ARA \n\ncontent of the paralarvae is identical to the observed in the hatchlings and both \n\nsignificantly higher than in the potential preys. This fact clarifies the ARA role as an \n\n\n\n3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile \n\n \n\n108 \n\n \n\nessential fatty acid. The high ARA content was already observed in mature females gonads \n\n(Rosa et al., 2004; Louren\u00e7o et al., 2014) and in hatchlings collected off the Gran Canaria \n\nIsland (J. Estefanell, pers comm).  \n\nThere are two possible sources for this input of ARA in paralarvae. One of the \n\nsources can be the PUFA rich tag intake through the meroplankton larvae. Alternatively, it \n\nmay be a product of the desaturation and chain elongation of 18:2n6 and 18:3n3 present in \n\nthe zooplankton (Dalsgaard et al., 2003; Almansa et al., 2006). As found in captive feeding \n\nexperiments (e.g. Navarro &amp; Villanueva, 2000, 2003; Almansa et al., 2006) O. vulgaris \n\nhatchlings and paralarvae are particularly rich in n-6HUFA in relation to their prey \n\nincluding ARA, EPA and DHA. The work conducted by Monroig and colleagues (Monroig \n\net al. 2012a, 2012b) showed that O. vulgaris are capable of the biosynthesis of several \n\nessential PUFA particularly C20:3n3, ARA and EPA from HUFA of the families C18 and \n\nC20. This fact can explain the high content in ARA found in the hatchlings and paralarvae \n\nin relation to their potential preys. According to Monroig et al., (2012a) the most common \n\npathway to the biosynthesis of ARA is through the elongation of n-6HUFA, particularly \n\nC20:4n6 that we failed to identify both in hatchlings and paralarvae samples. Probably \n\nother pathway can be active in the paralarvae, biosynthesizing ARA through the n-3HUFA, \n\nalthough this option is less clear (Dalsgaard et al., 2006; Monroig et al., 2012a). On the \n\nother hand, the higher peak of ARA identified in the hatchlings and paralarvae sample can \n\nbe associated with the of C20:3n3, normally a minor FA in marine product, that is also \n\nsynthesized by O. vulgaris (Monroig et al., 2012a) and was not separate from ARA in the \n\nGC column. \n\nThe comparison of the conditions indices and trophic markers with other studies \n\nconducted on O. vulgaris paralarvae and their potential preys (see Table 3.7) ashowed a \n\nconsistency between studies in the case of the protein: lipid ratio (Iglesias et al., 2013) and \n\nfor the FA trophic markers SFA: PUFA, DHA: EPA and DHA: ARA (Navarro &amp; \n\nVillanueva, 2000; Uriarte et al., 2011; Couto, 2012; Iglesias et al., 2013). It is worth noting \n\nthe variability observed in the tag content obtained here as compared to results obtained in \n\nthe previously cited studies. Both for the potential preys and for the O. vulgaris hatchlings, \n\nour results show a significantly lower content in tag by comparison with the feeding \n\nexperiments conducted by Navarro &amp; Villanueva (2000), Couto (2012) and Iglesias et al. \n\n(2013).  \n\n\n\n3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile \n\n \n\n109 \n\n \n\nThe high natural availability of HUFA n-3 (HUFA n-3: HUFA n-6 ~ 12) supports the \n\nresults obtained by Seixas et al. (2010) as they failed to observe any enhanced survival or \n\ngrowth when paralarvae were fed with Artemia enriched with DHA. DHA and other HUFA \n\nn-3 are naturally abundant in the prey of O. vulgaris paralarvae as well as in the summer \n\nphytoplankton community, so it is unlikely that these FA are limiting nutrient for the \n\ndevelopment of the species.  In this case, the protein: lipid ratio of the diet was found to be \n\nmore important to promote a good growth and survival of the paralarvae. A significant \n\npositive linear correlation was found between an increasing Protein: Lipid ratio in the diet \n\nand the dry weight of paralarvae, at 15 and 25 days of rearing, whereas no correlation \n\ncould be established between dietary DHA content and growth or survival of paralarvae \n\n(Seixas, 2009).   \n\nWe believe that the biochemical profile and trophic ratios determined here both for \n\nthe potential preys and for the O. vulgaris hatchlings allow an understanding of the \n\nnutritional requirements of the paralarval stage. Several studies showed that the lipid \n\ncontent of preys has a clear influence on the lipid composition of octopus paralarvae both \n\nat the level of lipid class and FA composition (Navarro &amp; Villanueva, 2000, 2003; Iglesias \n\net al., 2013). On the other hand, the nutritional profile of newly hatched paralarvae from \n\nthe wild permits the identification of the specific nutritional requirements under culture \n\nconditions, in order to attain a good nutritional condition independently of external factors \n\n(Uriarte et al., 2011). \n\nStudies such as this one are difficult to perform due to constrains related with the low \n\nnumber of wild O. vulgaris paralarvae that can normally be captured and to the high water \n\ncontent of their tissues. Nevertheless, the colorimetric methods applied herein facilitate the \n\nstudy of these small-sized O. vulgaris paralarvae. Further biochemical and physiological \n\nstudies on wild paralarvae after first feeding are however still needed to untangle the \n\nnutritional deficiencies verified under culture conditions for O. vulgaris paralarvae.    \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nThe authors want to acknowledge the crew of RV \"Mytilus\" and Marcos Regueira during \n\nzooplankton surveys, Manuel Garcia and Jorge Hern\u00e1ndez Urcera the divers that collect the hatchlings \n\nand to Lourdes Nieto for her availability to help with the biochemical analyses.

Recently, the biomass of this fishery \n\nresource sharply decreased in some areas causing a major concern among local fishermen and an \n\neffort is underway to advice on novel and sustainable management measures. In this context, the \n\noctopus pre-recruit aggregations along the Portuguese coast are identified using georeferenced \n\nfishery-independent data, from autumn and winter sampling between 1996 and 2008. The \n\nrelationships between pre-recruit aggregations and several environmental variables are analysed to \n\ncharacterize their essential habitats (EFH). Pre-recruits are distributed throughout the Portuguese \n\ncoast aggregated in 8 distinct recruitment grounds located on the middle-shelf at 11-19 km from the \n\ncoastline, which are characterised by average bottom depths of 65-110 m and to be associated to \n\nmajor rivers and lagoon systems. Within each season pre-recruit abundance is much higher in the \n\nsouth region, while pre-recruit aggregations on the northwest coast showed high inter-annual and \n\nseasonal variation driven by environmental variability. The western zone adjacent to Ria Formosa \n\nlagoon (southern coast) was identified as the main recruitment ground for O. vulgaris along the \n\nPortuguese coast. This is supported either by the higher abundance of pre-recruits and by the \n\nrecurrence of their presence in this area over the years analysed, both in autumn and winter. The \n\neffects of physical variables on pre-recruit abundance modelled with generalized additive models \n\n(GAM) showed important regional differences. Bottom salinity and river runoff are the \n\nenvironmental variables that have more impact on pre-recruit distribution and abundance on the \n\nwest coast, regardless of any seasonal effects. On the other hand, temperature imposes distinct \n\nseasonal and regional limitations to pre-recruit distribution, both on the NW and S regions. Pre-\n\nrecruit preferential habitat is characterised by bottom temperatures of 14 \u00baC, salinity values around \n\n36.0, low precipitation (average&lt;200 mm), and coarse sediments (in which they find shelters to \n\nescape predation). Some of the octopus recruitment grounds identified are located in areas under \n\nintense fishing pressure, both by artisanal fisheries using traps and by bottom trawling. Thus, their \n\nvalue for the sustainability of the octopus fishery should be taken into consideration in future \n\nmarine management strategies. \n\nKeywords: Octopus vulgaris, pre-recruits, recruitment grounds, habitat, EFH, Portugal. \n\n                                                        \n4\n Fisheries Research 152 (2014) 74-85 \n\n\n\n3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile \n\n \n\n116 \n\n \n\n3.3.1. Introduction \n\nThe common octopus, Octopus vulgaris Cuvier 1797, is one of the most \n\ncommercially important cephalopods worldwide. It is exploited as a target species by \n\ndemersal trawl fleets and several local fisheries, using hand jigs, pots, traps and trammel \n\nnets operating in southern Europe and northwestern Africa (Hastie et al., 2009). In Portugal \n\nit is also one of the most important fisheries resources, often the most important species in \n\nfirst sale value, with average landings of 8500 tonnes per year (1986 - 2011). It is captured \n\nmainly with traps (~90%), thus having a major importance in the Portuguese artisanal \n\nfishery, namely on the south region (Algarve), where it accounts for more than 20% of the \n\nfishing activity income (DGRM, 2012). The exploitation of octopus in Portugal increased \n\n50% in the last 20 years, largely motivated by the depletion of many finfish stocks. \n\nRecently, the landed biomass of this fishery resource has sharply decreased in some areas \n\ncausing a major concern among local fishermen and an effort is underway by scientists to \n\nadvice on novel and sustainable management measures.  \n\nO. vulgaris has a short life cycle of 12-18 months (Iglesias et al., 2004; Katsanevakis \n\n&amp; Verriopoulos, 2006). The spawning season extends, in general, throughout the year \n\n(Hastie et al., 2009). Over the NW Portuguese shelf spawning occurs in two main peaks \n\n(April and August) and at the south shelf a single peak is generally detected in summer \n\n(Louren\u00e7o et al., 2012). Paralarvae are planktonic and settle in the benthic habitat of adults \n\nat ca 173 mg of total weight (Mangold, 1983; Villanueva, 1995). After settlement animals \n\ngrow fast at ca. 1.2-1.6% d\n-1 \n\nreaching the fisheries minimum landing weight (750 g) at 9-\n\n10 months old (Domain et al., 2000; Katsanevakis &amp; Verriopoulos, 2006). O. vulgaris is \n\nmainly a coastal species (0-100 m depth) with a wide geographic distribution. Density is \n\nlow between 100 and 200 m and only few specimens have been found beyond the \n\ncontinental shelf break (Belcari &amp; Sartor, 1999; Quetglas et al., 2000; Silva et al., 2002; \n\nGarofalo et al., 2010). Juveniles and spawners have generally a distinct depth range \n\ndistribution (Sanchez &amp; Obarti, 1993; Hernandez-Garcia et al., 1997; Faraj &amp; Bez, 2007). \n\nOf the environmental variables that may affect the spatial distribution and abundance of \n\njuveniles, seawater temperature is thought to be the most important one (Garofalo et al., \n\n2010).  \n\nHabitat modelling for marine animals is increasingly used as a management tool, to \n\nsupport conservation and sustainable exploitation. \u201cEssential Fish Habitat\u201d (EFH) is the \n\nhabitat identified as essential to the ecological and biological requirements for critical life \n\n\n\n3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile \n\n \n\n117 \n\n \n\nhistory stages of exploited species, and which may require special protection to improve \n\nstock status and long term sustainability (e.g. Ardizzone, 2006; Valavanis &amp; Smith, 2007). \n\nEFH may be modelled based on the abundance of animals at specific life cycle stages (e.g. \n\njuveniles) and the habitat identified as the aggregation of abiotic and biotic parameters \n\nwhere individuals of that specific life cycle stage are concentrated (e.g. recruitment \n\ngrounds). Successful modelling depends on knowledge of species biology and ecology, \n\nthus permitting selection of appropriate variables, measured at an appropriate scale (see \n\nValavanis et al., 2008).  \n\nThe O. vulgaris life cycle characteristics increase this species resilience to high \n\nfishing pressure. At the same time O. vulgaris populations are vulnerable to overfishing \n\nbecause of non?overlapping generations (Boyle &amp; Rodhouse, 2005), and the juvenile phase \n\n(the pre-recruits) is therefore a key life stage on which we may concentrate fishery \n\nmanagement to ensure sustainability of this heavily exploited species. The present study \n\naims to, firstly identify along the Portuguese coast areas where pre-recruits of O. vulgaris \n\naggregate, using georeferenced fishery-independent data, that may be protected in future \n\nmanagement options; and secondly, to analyse the relationships between pre-recruit \n\nabundance and several abiotic environmental variables to delineate their optimum habitat.  \n\n \n\n3.3.2. Material and Methods \n\n3.3.2.1. Survey sampling \n\nTwo sets of bottom trawl surveys carried out on the Portuguese continental coast \n\nonboard R/V Noruega and R/V Capric\u00f3rnio were selected for the analysis of Octopus \n\nvulgaris pre-recruit aggregations, the autumn and winter surveys. The main objective of \n\nthese research surveys is to estimate indices of abundance and biomass of the most \n\ncommercially important fish and crustacean species. For our study we selected only the \n\nsurveys which used a bottom trawling net suitable to sample benthic species, the \n\n\u201cFGAV019\u201d, with a cod end of 20 mm mesh size, a mean vertical opening of 2.5 m and a \n\nmean horizontal opening between wings of 25 m. The sampling area covered latitudes \n\n36.7\u00ba to 41.8\u00ba N and longitudes 7.47\u00ba to 10.0\u00ba W in the NE Atlantic. Both datasets were \n\nobtained following a similar depth stratified sampling design, with ca. 70-80 hauls \n\ndistributed along the Portuguese continental shelf and slope (Figure 3.8). The tow duration \n\nvaried between 20 and 60 min, but no significant differences were previously found in the \n\n\n\n3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile \n\n \n\n118 \n\n \n\nmean abundance and length distribution for several species due to different tow duration \n\n(Cardador, pers comm). The number of hauls by research cruise and other characteristics of \n\nthe sampling procedure are detailed in Table 3.8. In each sampling station, all of the O. \n\nvulgaris captured were weighted (individual body weight, to the nearest g) and measured \n\n(mantle length, to the nearest 0.5 mm).  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.8 - Sampling stations in autumn and winter surveys.

Environmental data \n \n\nThe following environmental variables were selected and assigned to each sampling \n\nstation. Satellite-derived sea surface temperature data (SST) were obtained for each \n\nsampling station from the AVHRR Pathfinder V.5 provided by NASA-JPL-Physical \n\nOceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC). Sea bottom temperature \n\n(SBT), sea surface salinity (SSS), and sea bottom salinity (SBS) were extracted from CTD \n\ntemperature profiles undertaken during the survey cruises at the end of the fishing stations. \n\n\n\n3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile \n\n \n\n119 \n\n \n\nCTD data were not available for a few stations and for the winter2005 cruise. SBT data to \n\nfill in these gaps were obtained from CTD casts extracted from NODC and ICES \n\ndatabases. Bottom sediment type (BS) in each sampling station was classified based on the \n\nfishery charts from the Instituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico as gravel (gv), coarse sand (cs), sand (s), \n\nmud (md) and rocky mud (rm). River runoff (RR) from the main rivers and rainfall (RA) \n\nwere extracted from the Sistema Nacional de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o de Recursos H\u00eddricos \n\n(http://snirh.pt). \n\n \n\nTable 3.8 -  Octopus vulgaris sampling details for each research survey: number of fishing hauls, number of \n\nfishing hauls with O. vulgaris catches (Fishing hauls +),  in situ temperature and salinity data (CTD), number \n\nof individuals captured and sampled (N), percentage of pre-recruits and mean body weight of the pre-recruits \n\n(BWJ). \n\nCruise Start date End date Fishin\n\ng \n\nhauls \n\nFishin\n\ng \n\nhauls \n\n+ \n\nCTD N % pre-\n\nrecruits \n\nBWJ (g) \n\nAutumn96 11/10/1996 09/11/1996 82 39 + 397 69.8 373.3 \n\nAutumn99 29/10/1999 22/11/1999 82 27 + 103 55.3 403.8 \n\nAutumn03 07/10/2003 08/11/2003 83 33 + 86 55.8 397.4 \n\nAutumn04 23/10/2004 18/11/2004 79 34 + 140 75.0 311.7 \n\nWinter05 03/03/2005 31/03/2005 72 36 NA 368 83.4 350.2 \n\nWinter06 08/03/2006 03/04/2006 68 28 + 214 78.5 444.2 \n\nWinter07 10/03/2007 03/04/2007 68 41 + 187 78.6 307.7 \n\nWinter08 26/02/2008 18/03/2008 69 43 + 372 70.2 390.5 \n\n \n\n3.3.2.3. Data analysis \n\nOctopus with body weight below the fisheries minimum landing weight (750 g) \n\ncaptured on the survey cruises listed in Table 3.8, were classified as pre-recruits and their \n\ndistribution and abundance used to identify O. vulgaris recruitment grounds. Catches were \n\nconverted into an abundance index as number of pre-recruits per hour trawling. \n\nThe spatial distribution of pre-recruits was analysed and mapped with the \n\ngeostatistics interpolation method, Krigging (Cressie, 1991), implemented in the software \n\nSURFER 9.0. Pre-recruit abundance (PR) data were interpolated separately by Krigging, \n\nusing a linear variogram with no nugget effect, for each cruise and also averaged for \n\nautumn and winter cruises. Distinct recruitment grounds were spatially identified as those \n\nareas centered at pre-recruit distribution centroids with a mean PR ? 5 ind.h\n-1\n\n (in at least \n\nhttp://snirh.pt/\n\n\n3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile \n\n \n\n120 \n\n \n\none season). Additionally, to assess the relevance of each recruitment ground for the \n\ncommon octopus pre-recruits, an index of exclusiveness, EI was calculated as the ratio \n\nbetween PR and the total species abundance. To verify whether the recruitment grounds \n\nwere located in the same area consistently through time, an index of persistence, PI \n\n(adapted from Garofalo et al., 2010) was also estimated as the proportion of cruises within \n\neach season a given recruitment ground was actually used. \n\nTo analyze the spatial distribution, the sampled area was divided into 3 regions, \n\nwhich are environmentally different and 13 areas. To analyze distribution with depth \n\n(DepthZ), the sampling stations were also assigned to the inner-shelf (is,&lt;40 m), middle-\n\nshelf (ms, 40-90 m), outer-shelf (os, 90-200 m), and slope (s, > 200 m). The distance of \n\neach sampling station to the coast line (Dcoast) was also estimated. Total pressure (PRS) in \n\neach sampling station was estimated from bottom depth. A measure of RR by cruise and \n\narea was calculated as the total runoff in each of the 13 areas. A measure of RA by cruise \n\nand area was calculated as the total rainfall for the period of each survey cruise recorded in \n\nthe main coastal city in each of the 13 areas. These values were replicated and assigned to \n\neach sampling station within each area. Mean pre-recruit abundance was calculated in \n\nrelation to categorized temporal, spatial and physical variables. The effects of these \n\nexplanatory variables in pre-recruit abundances were investigated using one-way ANOVA, \n\nafter checking for normality in the sample distributions (Shapiro test), and for homogeneity \n\nof variances (Bartlett test). The interactions between Region and the other variables and the \n\ninteractions between Season and the other variables, were also tested by two-way ANOVA. \n\nThe relationships between log transformed pre-recruit abundance (logPR) and the \n\ncontinuous physical explanatory variables: Dcoast, PRES, SST, SBT, SSS, SBS, RA, and \n\nlog transformed RR (logRR) were further investigated using Generalised Additive Models \n\n(GAMs), thereby allowing non-linearity in the relationships to be taken into account. Since \n\nlogPR was normally distributed we used a Gaussian GAM with identity link. The nominal \n\nvariables Year and BS were also included in models. For all continuous explanatory \n\nvariables, degrees of freedom were constrained to be less than 5 to avoid overfitting. \n\nModels were fitted using a backwards selection starting with full models and removing \n\nexplanatory variables with non-significant partial effects. The Akaike Information \n\nCriterion (AIC) was used to choose the best fitting model (lowest AIC). More information \n\nabout these techniques can be found in Zuur et al. (2007). Preferred habitat (highest mean \n\n\n\n3.

Results \n\n3.3.3.1. Environmental variation along the Portuguese continental shelf \n \n\nOver the Portuguese continental shelf SST is much higher in autumn than in winter \n\nand was ca. 2-4 \u00baC lower in the NW region than in the S region. Within the period analysed \n\nautumn SST ranged between 14.0 \u00baC and 21.7 \u00baC and winter SST ranged between 11.6 \u00baC \n\nand 16.6 \u00baC (Figure 3.9 a). There was little seasonal variation in the mean SBT (13.9\u00b10.9 \n\n\u00baC), but SBT was on average ~1.5\u00baC lower in the NW region than in the S region. Autumn \n\nSBT ranged between 11.4 \u00baC and 17.3 \u00baC, and winter SBT ranged between 11.7 \u00baC and \n\n15.8 \u00baC (Figure 3.9 b). In autumn the water column was still stratified and important \n\ndifferences existed between SST and SBT, namely in the SW and S regions (~5 \u00baC). On the \n\ncontrary SST was only slightly higher than SBT during the winter period of water column \n\nmixing, namely on the NW region (~0.5 \u00baC). \n\nThe expected positive correlation between temperature and salinity may be observed \n\nby the spatial variation of salinity similar to that of temperature, decreasing with increasing \n\nlatitude and also away from the influence of the Mediterranean salty waters. Despite this \n\nfact, both mean SSS and mean SBS along the Portuguese shelf were lower in autumn \n\n(when temperature was higher) than in winter (Figure 3.9 c, d). Rainfall levels during \n\nautumn and winter were similar between areas 1 and 10, but towards the north rainfall \n\nincreased substantially, especially during autumn (Figure 3.10 a). The higher river runoff \n\nlevels occurred in autumn located at areas 7, 10, 12 and 13 (Figure 3.10 b), associated \n\nmainly to the rivers Tagus, Mondego, Douro and Lima, respectively. The low saline waters \n\nfrom these river discharges generally spread along the west coast with a poleward \n\ndirection, therefore with no influence in the areas south of area 7. The seasonal differences \n\nin salinity derive most likely from the higher levels of autumn rainfall and consequent river \n\ndischarges, which contributed to a decrease in salinity of coastal waters more significant in \n\nautumn than in winter. \n\n3.3.3.2. Recruitment grounds   \n \n\n\n\n3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile \n\n \n\n122 \n\n \n\nO. vulgaris pre-recruits were quite frequent (55-83% of total octopus catches) both \n\nduring the autumn and winter research surveys and were represented by specimens with a \n\nmean body weight of 300 - 450 g (Table 3.8). They were widely distributed along the \n\nPortuguese coast, but an important seasonality in their distribution and abundance was \n\napparent, in winter, octopus pre-recruits were more abundant, spread and shifted towards \n\nthe south (Figure 3.11). In winter abundance was twice as high (mean PR ? 6ind.h\n-1\n\n) as in \n\nautumn (mean PR ? 3ind.h\n-1\n\n), in particular during the winter2005 and winter2008 surveys. \n\nHowever, on the NW region, pre-recruit abundance was higher in autumn, namely in the \n\nautumn1996 survey. Within each season abundance was much higher on the S region, \n\nespecially at area 2, where the concentration of pre-recruits was recurrent each year.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.9 - Spatial variation of (a) mean sea surface temperature (SST), (b) mean sea bottom temperature \n\n(SBT), (c) mean sea surface salinity (SSS), and (d) mean sea bottom salinity (SBS) during the autumn and \n\nwinter surveys in areas a01 to a13 within the northwest (NW), southwest (SW) and south (S) regions. \n\nVertical bars denote standard error. \n\n\n\n3.

Vertical bars denote \n\nstandard error. \n\nPre-recruits were found aggregated in eight distinct grounds, A to H. On the NW \n\nregion 3 recruitment grounds were identified during autumn (Figure 3.12 a), located close \n\nto the mouth of river Lima (A, only present in autumn1996 survey); close to river Douro \n\nand the lagoon system of Ria de Aveiro (B); and south of river Mondego (C). During \n\nwinter (Figure 3.12 b), the recruitment ground B shifted to the southern part of Ria de \n\nAveiro, partially merging with C. On the SW region, 3 recruitment grounds were also \n\nidentified: D located at ? 140 m in autumn in the vicinity of the Nazar\u00e9 canyon and shifted \n\nsouthwards closer to the mouth of river Tagus in winter; E at area 6, close to the estuary of \n\nthe river Sado with higher PR in winter; and the recruitment ground F at areas 4 and 5 \n\nextending from the coastline to offshore of the 130 m isobath in winter. On the S region the \n\nhighest concentration of pre-recruits was located west of the lagoon system of Ria Formosa \n\n(H) in autumn (mean above 30 ind.h\n-1\n\n). The whole S region could be considered a single \n\nrecruitment ground in winter. Despite this, based on spatial differences in abundance \n\nwithin this region, two distinct areas of concentration of pre-recruits may be identified: the \n\nrecruitment ground G centred at area 3; and H with the highest concentration of pre-\n\nrecruits (winter mean above 80 ind.h\n-1\n\n), centred at area 2 west of the lagoon system of Ria \n\nFormosa, as was in autumn, but spreading eastwards into area 1. \n\n \n\n\n\n3.

Overall, the \n\nmost persistent recruitment grounds, with PI=1, were the recruitment grounds F and G in \n\nwinter and H both in autumn and winter. Additionally, these grounds were important \n\nhabitats in particular for pre-recruits showing high levels of exclusiveness (EI). The \n\nrecruitment grounds on the NW region showed high EI but low PI giving evidence of \n\nhigher inter-annual variation in pre-recruit distribution within this region. \n\n \n\n\n\n3.

Environmental effects and essential habitat   \n \n\nANOVA results indicated that the individual effects of all temporal, spatial and \n\nphysical variables analysed on pre-recruit abundance were significant. The effects of the \n\nexplanatory variables Year, DepthZ, Dcoast, BS, SST and SBT were significantly \n\ndependent of Region, but independent from any seasonal effects (except for SST) (Table \n\n3.10). The effects of the physical variables related to water salinity: SSS, SBS, RA, and \n\nRR, were independent both of Region and Season.  \n\nTo further investigate the relationships between physical variables and pre-recruit \n\nabundance, GAMs were fitted separately for the NW, SW and S regions given the above \n\nmentioned \u201cexplanatory variable\u201d: Region interactions. The optimum models are listed in \n\nTable 3.11.

Pre-recruit \n\nabundance presented an important inter-annual variation within each region (Figure 3.13 \n\na), particularly high in autumn 1996 on the NW region and in autumn 2004 on the S \n\nregion. During winter, the abundance was very high in 2005, 2006 and 2008 on the S \n\nregion and in 2007 on the SW region.

Their abundance was the highest over gravel on the NW region and coarse sand on \n\nthe S region (gravel not sampled). The effect of BS on the SW region was not significant \n\n(Table 3.11), but the overlay of the recruitment grounds on a bottom sediments type map \n\n(online figure) showed that those on the SW region were located over several BS, all \n\nneighbouring rock outcrops. \n\nPre-recruits were concentrated mainly in the middle-shelf at a mean depth of 79 m \n\n(\u00b144 SD) on the NW region, 108 m (\u00b145 SD) on the SW region, and 66 m (\u00b131 SD) on the \n\nS region, with insignificant seasonal variation in the preferred depth zone (Figure 3.13 c). \n\nThe highest abundances were located at 19 km (\u00b19 SD) from the coastline on the NW \n\nregion, 11 km (\u00b16 SD) on the SW region, and 13 km (\u00b13 SD) on the S region (Figure 3.13 \n\nd). The distribution limit was slightly deeper in winter (360 m) than in autumn (332 m), but \n\nabundances on the slope deeper than 350 m (PRS > 35.7 atm) were consistently rather low \n\n(Table 3.9, PR &lt;1 ind.h\n-1\n\n). On the SW region, because the continental shelf is narrow and \n\nsteep, pre-recruits aggregated on the middle-shelf deeper than in the other regions (see also \n\nTable 3.9). Nevertheless, distribution on the west coast was mainly affected by the distance \n\n\n\n3.

Abundance decreased linearly \n\nwith increasing distance to the coast line; gradually on the wider continental shelf of the \n\nNW region (Figure 3.14 a), and more obviously on the narrow and steeper continental shelf \n\nof the SW region (Figure 3.14 e). On the other hand, pre-recruit distribution on the S \n\nregion was mainly affected by PRS, with abundance abruptly decreasing until depths of 25 \n\natm and with no further effect in deeper waters (Figure 3.14 h). \n\nTable 3.11 - Results for the optimum GAMs fit to logPR (log transformed pre-recruit abundance) on the \n\nnorthwest (NW), southwest (SW) and south (S) regions.

On the NW region, the effect of SST was non-linear showing some seasonal \n\ndependence: abundance increases with increasing local winter SST and with increasing \n\nlocal autumn SST, i.e. main recruitment grounds are located under the warmest \n\ntemperatures available and the general SST effect seems a more complex nonlinear \n\nrelationship (Figure 3.14 b). On the other hand, abundance decreases with increasing SST \n\non the S region (Figure 3.14 i). In this region, over the continental shelf, pre-recruits were \n\nfound associated preferably with SST of 16.0 \u00baC (\u00b11.8 SD). The effect of SBT showed \n\nsome regional dependence, but regional SBT differences were of small magnitude and the \n\neffect of this explanatory variable on GAMs for each region was negligible (Table 3.11). \n\nPre-recruits were found associated preferentially with SBT of 14.0 \u00baC (\u00b10.7 SD) on the \n\nNW region, 14.1 \u00baC (\u00b10.7 SD) on the SW region and 14.6 \u00ba C (\u00b10.9 SD) on the S region. In \n\ngeneral, pre-recruit habitat seems to be limited to temperatures above 12.0 \u00baC, SST>13\u00baC \n\nand SBT>12\u00baC (Table 3.12). \n\n \n\n\n\n3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile \n\n \n\n130 \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\nFigure 3.13 \u2013 Variation of mean abundance of O. vulgaris pre-recruits on the NW (black bar), SW (grey bar) \n\nand S (white bar) regions by (a) in each research cruise (Year), (b) bottom sediment (BS), (c) depth zone \n\n(DepthZ), and (d) distance to coast line (Dcoast). \n\n \n\nPre-recruit abundance was consistently higher in the more saline waters, with salinity \n\n? 36.0, independently of any regional or seasonal effects. The effect of SSS was not \n\nrelevant to explain pre-recruit distribution, but on the NW region abundance increased with \n\nSBS between 35.5 and 36.2 where most data were obtained. Moreover, the exceptional \n\noccurrence of recruitment ground A was probably related to the unusual high salinities in \n\narea 13 verified in autumn1996 survey. Episodic lower salinities also introduced some \n\ncomplexity to the SBS effect on this region (Figure 3.14c). SBS explained also the location \n\nof recruitment grounds on the SW region: pre-recruit abundance increased with increasing \n\nSBS until a maximum of ca. 36.1, decreasing towards the saltiest waters (Figure 3.14 f). In \n\ngeneral, pre-recruit habitat was limited by SBS below 35.60 and above 36.30 (Table 3.12). \n\n\n\n3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile \n\n \n\n131 \n\n \n\nHigher concentrations of pre-recruits were also related to areas with relatively low \n\nrainfall (preferred RA = 166\u00b182 mm), such as on the S region (Table 3.12). However, \n\nrainfall was not relevant to explain pre-recruit distribution within each region (Table 3.11). \n\nSimilarly, the highest concentrations of pre-recruits were found on the S region, where \n\nthere is considerably less river runoff than on the west coast (Figure 3.10 b). Both on the \n\nNW and SW regions, distribution and abundance were significantly affected by RR. \n\nDespite the main recruitment grounds were located close to the main rivers and lagoon \n\nsystems, i.e. associated to areas with important river runoff, abundance decreased under the \n\nhighest runoff levels of the NW region (Figure 3.14 d). This negative effect was not \n\nobserved on the SW region, (Figure 3.14 g), despite the important RR levels which \n\noccurred in area 7 (Figure 3.10 b). \n\n \n\n3.3.4. Discussion \n\nO. vulgaris pre-recruits were widely distributed along the Portuguese coast. The \n\nabundance was substantially higher in the south coastal waters than on the west coast as \n\nexpected, considering that the general distribution of this species in the Eastern Atlantic \n\nhave the highest densities towards the south, namely on the north-western coasts of Africa \n\n(Balguerias et al., 2000). Pre-recruit distribution in Portuguese waters was patchy and \n\nanimals aggregated in several recruitment grounds. The area surrounding the lagoon \n\nsystem \u201cRia de Aveiro\u201d seems to be the most important recruitment ground for O. vulgaris \n\nin the NW region, and on the SW region pre-recruits aggregated in recruitment grounds \n\nclose to Tagus and Sado estuaries. Moreover, on the S region, despite the whole continental \n\nshelf showed a high abundance of small octopus, they were aggregated more abundantly \n\nclose to the lagoon system \u201cRia Formosa\u201d. Consequently, some of the most important \n\nrecruitment grounds of O. vulgaris are located in the vicinity of estuarine or lagoon \n\nsystems. These are highly productive ecosystems with high abundance and diversity of \n\nmarine fish and invertebrate species, providing excellent feeding conditions to the young \n\nstages of many species (Cabral et al., 2007). Species such as O. vulgaris, which are \n\nstenohaline in all life stages, are not estuarine inhabitants, but may take advantage of these \n\nproductive ecosystems by living in their vicinity.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n3.

Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile \n\n \n\n133 \n\n \n\nLikewise in Portuguese waters, in other areas of O. vulgaris distribution, juveniles and sub-\n\nadults generally aggregate in coastal waters at a relatively short distance from the coastline. \n\nIt is the case of several Mediterranean areas, where the highest abundances of O. vulgaris \n\ncaptured by bottom trawl surveys (mostly pre-recruits) were found within the depth range \n\nof 10-50 m by Belcari et al. (2002). Similarly, sub-adult densities are higher in shallow \n\nwaters (20-40 m) than further offshore in the NW African coasts (Faraj &amp; Bez, 2007). Even \n\nso, these authors located the preferred distribution of small octopus inshore of the main \n\nrecruitment grounds identified along the Portuguese coast. In contrast, a different \n\ndemographic distribution was described by Belcari et al. (2002), Quetglas et al. (1998) and \n\nSanchez &amp; Obarti (1993) for the Western Mediterranean and by Hernandez-Garcia et al. \n\n(1997) for the Canary Islands, as they all observed a wider bathymetric distribution of the \n\nsmall animals.  In Portuguese waters we also found a wide distribution of O. vulgaris pre-\n\nrecruits, with aggregations centred at mean depths of ~80 m, and approximately at 10-15 \n\nkm from the coast. However, the surveyed area of the cruises analysed poorly covers the \n\ninner-shelf, namely on the S region (see Figure 3.8), the region where the abundance was \n\nthe highest, which may have contributed to an overestimation of the pre-recruit preferred \n\ndepth or distance to the coast line. Overcoming this sampling constrain, both the spatial \n\ndistribution predicted by geostatistics interpolation of abundance and the GAM modelling \n\nof the Depth or Dcoast effects on PR for each region indicated that PR increases towards \n\nshallow waters, and for that reason the main recruitment grounds should be in general \n\nlocated in even more coastal areas. \n\nO. vulgaris adults are equally abundant over a variety of sediment types (Mangold, \n\n1983). Nevertheless, we observed that sub-adults have a preference for large grain \n\nsediments, namely gravel and coarse sand. Despite the lack of sampling over the rocky \n\nocean floor, we found also the pre-recruit distribution to be closely related to the proximity \n\nof rocky bottoms and abundance over mud with rock outcrops significantly higher than \n\nover soft mud. This positive relationship between small size octopus density and sediment \n\ngrain size was also documented by Katsanevakis &amp; Verriopoulos (2004a) in Greek waters. \n\nThis sediment type preference is, to some extent, related to their necessity of sheltering to \n\navoid predation, and octopuses do it either selecting or building shelters (\u201cdens\u201d) in the \n\nsubstratum (Mather, 1988).  \n\nThe relationships between pre-recruit abundance and several abiotic environmental \n\nvariables were analyzed to delineate pre-recruit optimum habitat and eventual \n\n\n\n3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile \n\n \n\n134 \n\n \n\nenvironmental limitations to their distribution. Using presence-absence data, Hermosilla et \n\nal. (2011) modelled the distribution and large scale habitat preferences of O. vulgaris in the \n\nEastern Atlantic and Mediterranean and concluded that the area used by octopus differs \n\nfrom the average available environmental conditions in terms of bottom temperature and \n\nbottom salinity.  \n\nIn Portuguese waters salinity proved to be an important determinant for the \n\naggregation of O. vulgaris pre-recruits. Their distribution was limited by SBS below 35.60 \n\nand above 36.30 and the preferred habitat was characterized by salinities of ? 36.0. The \n\nhigher abundance was hence observed on the S region, where both rainfall and river runoff \n\nare generally low and mean seasonal SBS has a narrow range (36.01-36.21, Figure 3.9 d). \n\nWithin its global distribution this species prefers habitats with bottom salinity between 30 \n\nand 45 (Hermosilla et al., 2011), and is fairly abundant under salinities at least up to 39 \n\n(e.g. in the Greek Seas, Katsanevakis &amp; Verriopoulos, 2004a). Thus, the reason why we \n\nobserved a negative effect of salinities above 36.03 in Portuguese waters may be partially \n\nrelated to the low availability of more saline waters in the study area, or that negative effect \n\nrelates to regional environmental tolerances. At the same time, low salinity is a limitation \n\nfor octopus survival (Chapela et al., 2006; Vaz-Pires et al., 2004) and hence constrains its \n\ndistribution. The negative effect of SBS was mainly observed on the west coast. Here, \n\nsalinities generally fall below 36.0 in autumn and winter, namely on the northern area \n\ncaused by heavy rainfall and subsequent important river discharges. Despite this, as \n\nmentioned before, several recruitment grounds were identified close to large rivers and \n\nlagoon systems (although this does not equate to low salinity water). The proximity to \n\nestuarine systems provides an increased availability of prey, namely bivalves, but greatly \n\nenhances the risk of low salinity episodes. In fact, mass mortality episodes of O. vulgaris \n\nhave sometimes been reported on the Portuguese coast and have been related to sudden \n\nfalls in water salinity due to intense river discharges, following heavy rainfall periods \n\n(Ruano, 2011).  \n\nThe effect of temperature on pre-recruits distribution was also important, even if less \n\nsignificant than salinity. It was observed that SST affects the distribution and abundance of \n\noctopus paralarvae in their zooplanktonic habitat (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2005; Moreno et al., \n\n2009). However, it is expected that the subsequent life stages, living strongly associated \n\nwith the ocean floor, suffer a more intense (or direct) influence of the temperature near the \n\nbottom. In that sense, pre-recruits were found associated preferably with SBT between 15 \n\n\n\n3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile \n\n \n\n135 \n\n \n\nand 16 \u00baC and the main recruitment grounds were limited to mean SBT > 13.6 \u00baC. \n\nSimilarly, to the general distribution of the species in relation to the available environment \n\ndescribed by Hermosilla and co-workers (2011), we found that the pre-recruits of O. \n\nvulgaris concentrate also under the warmest temperatures, i.e. prefer areas where SBT have \n\nan average greater than those of the environment. On the other hand, if compared with the \n\nhabitat modelling in Hermosilla et al. (2011), cold water (SBT &lt;12 \u00baC) seems to impose a \n\nmore pronounced limitation to pre-recruit distribution than to adult distribution. During the \n\nsurveys analysed, SBT was quite stable within each region and no significant effect of this \n\nvariable on PR was retained by GAMs. Even so, on the NW region we observed important \n\nseasonal and inter-annual variation in distribution and abundance of pre-recruits which \n\nmay stand for seasonal and yearly differences in SBT (e.g. unusual low SBT in autumn \n\n2004). Even if temperature at surface supposedly affects less the life stages living on the \n\nbottom, we found a significant effect of SST on pre-recruit distribution (positive on the \n\nwest regions and negative on the S region). Pre-recruit preferred habitat was characterized \n\nby SSTs of 15.3-16.0 \u00baC and limited by SST<13 \u00baC. Furthermore, SSTs above 21 \u00baC seem \n\nto have constrained the eastwards spread of the recruitment ground H on the S region in \n\n2003. In this region the Year effect was not kept in the optimum GAM for the S region and \n\nconsequently the inter-annual variation in pre-recruit abundance in this region must be \n\nexplained essentially by SST (the only variable in the model passive of yearly changes). \n\nOther studies which modelled O. vulgaris abundance in relation to environmental \n\nvariables found that oceanographic conditions play a very significant role in determining \n\nthe distribution and abundance during the paralarval phase (e.g. Moreno et al., 2009; Otero \n\net al., 2009). Inter-relationships between paralarval distribution, settlement and recruitment \n\nground locations are still largely unknown. This is a field in which much work is still \n\nrequired and that we expect will be evolving in the near future.  \n\nBased on pre-recruit abundance, PI and EI together we may consider the winter \n\nrecruitment grounds D and F on the SW region, and G and H on the S region, as the main \n\npre-recruit hot spots on the Portuguese continental shelf, where these animals meet their \n\noptimum habitat. Ria Formosa recruitment ground (H) is probably the most important O. \n\nvulgaris pre-recruit hot spot along the Portuguese coast showing the highest abundances \n\nboth in autumn and in winter. Important recruitment grounds were also observed on the \n\nNW region close to Ria the Aveiro (B) and south the mouth of the river Mondego (C), but \n\n\n\n3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile \n\n \n\n136 \n\n \n\npre-recruit abundance showed larger inter-annual variation, probably associated to the \n\nenvironmental dynamics of the local upwelling ecosystem. \n\nOverall, the distribution pattern of pre-recruits predicted by the spatial interpolation \n\nmight have missed the identification of some important aggregation areas. Indeed, the \n\nmodel predicted low concentration of small octopuses in the eastern part of the south coast. \n\nNotwithstanding, according to fishermen surveys, in this part of the coast aggregations \n\noccur in very shallow waters (6\u201312m depth) between October and December, with higher \n\nconcentrations in front of the inlets of the Ria Formosa lagoon and near the estuary of the \n\nriver Guadiana. In these areas, there is high abundance of prey, mainly bivalves (Rufino et \n\nal., 2010), and the substrate is coarse (Rosa et al., in press) with a high fraction of bioclasts \n\nconstituted by large molluscan shells fragments where small octopuses can hide. \n\nAltogether, food availability and habitat characteristics might explain the high \n\nconcentration of pre-recruits in this part of the coast. Similarly, fishermen also reported \n\nthat small-sized octopuses are numerous during winter in the westernmost part of the south \n\ncoast (between Lagos and Sagres), especially near the rocky outcrops in inshore waters, \n\nwhere they find refuge from predators.  \n\nThe recruitment grounds in the proximity of Ria de Aveiro and close to Ria Formosa \n\nare areas subject to intense fishing activity: the artisanal fishery (traps and pots) exploits \n\nthe inshore part and the bottom trawl fishery exploits the offshore part of those recruitment \n\ngrounds (Pilar-Fonseca et al., 2014). In principle, Portuguese fishery regulations determine \n\nthat small animals (<750g) are to be returned to the water if caught, which if respected \n\nwould suffice to maintain the safety of octopus recruitment grounds, regardless of the type \n\nof activity in the area. Nevertheless, the identification of a spatially restricted critical area \n\ncould be useful to the legislation reinforcement.  \n\nThis study was an essential first step towards the understanding of O. vulgaris pre-\n\nrecruits essential habitat. Nevertheless, we recognize that further information should be \n\nobtained in future studies to complement and refine our research. First of all, abundance \n\nbased on trawl data should be complemented with data from other sources because the \n\nefficiency of a fishing trawl depends on the type of dens that the octopuses use in the \n\nsurveyed area, which varies in relation to depth, octopus size, and sediment type \n\n(Katsanevakis &amp; Verriopolus, 2004b). Additionally, it would be desirable to include other \n\nsources of abundance data to have a better coverage of octopus distribution over the inner-\n\nshelf, and in areas with extensive deployment of artisanal fishing gears, where survey \n\n\n\n3.

More input derived from \u201cFishers ecological knowledge\u201d \n\n(FEK) would be desirable in future studies. \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEGEMENTS \n\nWe are very grateful to the survey cruise teams for all the octopus sampling.

Recently, several studies have successfully validated the daily deposition of growth \n\nrings in the vestigial shell or stylets of several octopus species. Octopus vulgaris eggs were \n\nincubated to hatching at two different temperatures, 18\no\nC and 22\n\no\nC, to determine stylet size at \n\nhatching and assess the effect of temperature in the stylet dimensions. The 3 days-old hatchlings \n\nwere sectioned transversally and 6 \u00b5m sections were stained to enhance the stylet position and \n\nvisibility. The sections were observed under transmitted light microscopy at 1000x magnification, \n\nand the stylets identified as blue/green structures inside of the mantle \u2013 funnel retractor muscle. \n\nThe transversal sections of the whole paralarva allowed the diameter of the embryonic stylet of an \n\noctopus species to be measured for the first time. The mean stylet diameter in three-day old \n\nparalarvae is 3.99 ?m independently of the thermal conditions. Moreover, significant differences in \n\nstylet size between captive and wild paralarvae were observed; the latter showed significantly \n\nlarger stylets, an indication that they are over three-days old. Our results also evidence that the \n\nstylet nucleus of hatchlings is much smaller than previously thought based on measurements in \n\nstylets of juveniles and adults, and its' dimensions are independent of paralarva and stylet size.  \n\n \n\nKeywords: Octopus vulgaris, hatchlings, vestigial shell, stylet, age.  \n\n                                                        \n5\n Submitted to the Journal of the Marine Biological Association UK.  \n\n\n\n4. Assessing age in Octopus vulgaris juvenile \n\n \n\n144 \n\n \n\n4.1.1. Introduction \n\nThe assessment of growth and age provides important input data for many stock \n\nassessment models and thus is very important for the sustainable management of fisheries \n\nstocks. In cephalopods, considering that the success of recruitment depends almost entirely \n\non environmental conditions, it is quite important to understand how reproduction, life \n\nspan and in particular growth, are affected by those conditions. \n\nOctopus vulgaris Cuvier 1797 is an important resource for the artisanal and industrial \n\nfisheries in all of the Atlantic margin of the Iberian peninsula, with annual average landings \n\nof 9185 tons in Portugal (INE, 2013) and 4000 in Galicia (Otero et al., 2005). Females of \n\nthis species brood thousands of small eggs usually in rocky crevices (Rocha et al., 2001). \n\nAfter hatching, the jet-propelled hatchlings (paralarvae) stay in the pelagic realm, where \n\nthey are highly vulnerable to predation by the macro zooplankton (mainly decapods) and \n\nmid water fish (Roura, 2013; Villanueva &amp; Norman, 2008). During the first days, \n\nparalarvae still carry the yolk sac within the visceral mass and combine endogeneous \n\n(yolk) with exogenous (prey) feeding until the yolk is completely consumed (Villanueva &amp; \n\nNorman, 2008). Thereafter, the paralarvae grow exponentially until settlement, followed by \n\na logarithmic phase where the instantaneous growth rate decreases until the maturation \n\nphase is complete (Mangold, 1983; Villanueva, 1995). The life span of O. vulgaris was \n\nestimated in one to two years (Domain, Jouffre, &amp; Caverivi\u00e9re, 2000; Katsanevakis &amp; \n\nVerriopoulos, 2006). Direct ageing methods based on statolith increment analysis were not \n\nfound to be useful in incirrate octopods, while approaches using beaks in Octopus vulgaris \n\nstill need accuracy validation, in particular due to erosion by feeding (Raya &amp; Hern\u00e1ndez-\n\nGonz\u00e1lez, 1998; Perales-Raya et al., 2010; Canali et al., 2011). A further alternative to \n\nperform direct age assessments is the use of the vestigial shell or stylet (Sousa Reis &amp; \n\nFernandes, 2002). Stylets are slender, needle\u2013shaped and bent rods, a non-calcified ?-chitin \n\nstructure lying obliquely on the dorso-lateral side of the mantle, that arose from the \n\nreduction of the shell in the Incirrata (Budelmann et al., 1997; Naef, 1921, 1923 in \n\nBizikov, 2004). Its function is unclear in finless octopus but its position in the insertion of \n\nthe funnel retractors, visceral sac and gillnets in the mantle is an indication of a structural \n\nfunction (Budelmann et al., 1997; Bizikov, 2004). Growth of stylets progresses from the \n\ncentre (stylet primordium) located in the bend through the deposition of concentric layers \n\nof semi-transparent chitin. Growth increments and apical lines are clearly visible inside \n\nboth shoulders under transmitted light (Bizikov, 2004). In the case of Octopus pallidus the \n\n\n\n4. Assessing age in Octopus vulgaris juvenile \n\n \n\n145 \n\n \n\nnucleus looks pale with no discernable increments (Doubleday et al., 2006). The chemical \n\ncomposition of the matrix of the stylets is based on hydrated calcium phosphates (e.g. \n\nhydroxiapatite) and a fraction of the vestigial elements P, Cl and Ca, which can be used to \n\ndifferentiate increment bands (Doubleday et al., 2008; Marquez &amp; Re, 2009; Napole\u00e3o et \n\nal., 2005).  \n\nStylets have recently been used successfully to assess age in wild populations of \n\nsome octopus species (e.g. O. pallidus, Leporati et al., 2008; O. cyanea, Herwig et al., \n\n2012). The fast degradation of the structure upon contact with air and the abrasive \n\ntechniques used to expose the growth structures are major concerns to the standardization \n\nof the techniques and their regular implementation. Nevertheless, new preparation methods \n\nare being developed, which appear to produce good quality stylet sections (Barratt &amp; \n\nAllcock, 2010) and consequently the age determination by stylet increment analysis (SIA) \n\nis potentially an effective tool for the age determination in O. vulgaris, as was first \n\nadvanced by Sousa-Reis &amp; Fernandes (2002). It is also worth noting that the daily \n\ndeposition of growth increments in the stylets of adults of this species was validated by \n\nHermosilla et al. (2010) by staining the stylets with oxytetracycline and tetracycline, and \n\ncomparing the number of rings produced after staining with the number of days elapsed. \n\nHowever, this marking of adult structures does not validate the age of an individual at first \n\nincrement formation, essential for a rigorous age validation of the SIA in each species \n\n(Campana, 2001). The difficulties and potential inaccuracies associated with determining \n\nthe age of merobenthic octopuses (such as O. vulgaris) using SIA and the importance of \n\nvalidating age at first increment formation are discussed in Doubleday et al. (2011). \n\nThe present study aimed firstly to develop a technique to rapidly locate the stylets in \n\nthe muscle of paralarvae, and secondly to determine the stylet size at hatching in newly \n\nhatched O. vulgaris paralarvae as a tool to define the starting point for age determination in \n\nstylets of later stages. Additionally, the stylets of three-day old paralarvae were compared \n\nto unknown age paralarvae captured in the wild to determine if the stylet nuclear area is \n\nconservative between paralarvae of different sizes and ages and between animals incubated \n\nat different temperatures.  \n\n \n\n4.1.2. Material and Methods \n\n\n\n4. Assessing age in Octopus vulgaris juvenile \n\n \n\n146 \n\n \n\nRecently spawned eggs of O. vulgaris were raised in captivity at 18\no\nC and 22\n\no\nC. \n\nAfter hatching, three day-old paralarvae from both experimental temperatures were \n\ncollected. Three-day old paralarvae were chosen to ensure some growth past the hatch \n\ncheck and permit the observation of increments if already formed. All paralarvae were \n\npreserved in 70% ethanol. Wild and captive paralarvae were measured under transmitted \n\nlight binocular microscopy at 30 x magnification. Measurements were taken as follows: \n\ntotal length (TL in mm), mantle ventral length (ML in mm), eye diameter (D-eye in mm) \n\nand total weight (W in mg). \n\nTo establish the most adequate protocol that could simultaneously permit the location \n\nand examination of several sections of the paralarval stylet, six captive individuals were \n\nembedded in paraffin and sectioned (in 6 \u00b5m width sections) according to three \n\nmorphological planes: (A) the sagittal, (B) transversal, and (C) frontal planes (Figure 4.1). \n\nSections were stained with acetic alcian blue solution (n = 3) and Masson\u2019s trichrome (n = \n\n3) in order to enhance the fibrous nature of the stylets, by staining fibrin tissue in a solution \n\nof acetic alcian blue (adapted from Vecchione, 1991) or light green/blue (Jones, 2002), \n\nrespectively. It was expectable that the staining would improve the identification of the \n\nstructures inside the mantle and funnel muscles. Stained sections were observed under a \n\nbinocular microscope equipped with transmitted light, at 400 x and 1000 x magnification. \n\nAll sections were sequentially photographed. Taking into account the results of the \n\nexperiment above, two groups of 3 day-old paralarvae (18\u00baC group and 22\u00baC group, n=20) \n\nand wild paralarvae (n=9) were subsequently sectioned in the transversal plane in 6 \u00b5m \n\nsections and stained with Masson\u2019s Trichrome method. All sections were observed under \n\ntransmitted light at a magnification of 400 x and 1000 x and photographed. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 \u2013 Octopus vulgaris paralarva and section plans used to obtain transversal sections of the stylets. \n\n(A) sagital plan; (B) transversal plan; (C) frontal plan.  \n\n \n\n\n\n4. Assessing age in Octopus vulgaris juvenile \n\n \n\n147 \n\n \n\nThe elected transversal sections of the stylet (the best transversal section closer to the \n\nstylet bend), were used to identify the embryonic primordium or nucleus of the stylet and \n\nto estimate the diameter of the stylet at hatching. The nucleus is limited by a discontinuity \n\nwhich appears as a high-contrast micro-increment with a deeply darker zone under \n\ntransmitted light, or an abrupt change in the micro-structural growth pattern (Panfili et al., \n\n2002). \n\nStylet measurements were taken under 1000x magnification from the selected section \n\nof the stylet, as follows: stylet diameter (SD in \u00b5m), stylet perimeter (SP in \u00b5m), stylet area \n\n(SA in \u00b5m\n2\n), stylet major radius (SRmax in \u00b5m) and the radius of the nucleus (SRnucleus \n\nin \u00b5m). \n\nTo assess the effect of temperature on paralarva and stylet sizes, size data were \n\ngrouped according to the incubation temperature and sampling source, as \u201c18\u00baC\u201d and \n\n\u201c22\u00baC\u201d groups for paralarvae raised in captivity and \u201cwild\u201d group for the paralarvae \n\ncollected during the mesozooplankton surveys. Prior to the statistical analysis, the \n\nassumptions of sample normality and homogeneity were assessed by group with Shapiro-\n\nWilk\u2019s and Bartlett\u00b4s tests, respectively. A non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to \n\nidentify differences in mean measurements between groups, followed by a non-parametric \n\npost-hoc test whenever significant differences were found between mean values. \n\nAdditionally, wild paralarvae of unknown age were collected in July and September \n\n2010 in R\u00eda de Vigo (Southwest Galicia, Spain) during mesozooplankton surveys. These \n\nparalarvae were collected in depth and surface strata using a multitrawl (MultiNet\n\u00ae\n) \n\nsampler (0.71 \u00d7 0.71 m opening frame, see Roura (2013) for details). The wild paralarvae \n\nwere stored in 70 % ethanol and measured similarly to the captive paralarvae. These were \n\nthen transversally sectioned according to the protocol defined for captive paralarvae and \n\nstained with Hemotoxylin &amp; Eosin. Selected sections were measured following the same \n\nprocedure defined for the captive paralarvae. The wild paralarvae and respective stylet \n\ndimensions were compared with the captivity group with a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis \n\ntest of variance.  \n\nA Spearman correlation index was used to identify cases of collinearity between the \n\nmeasurements taken from the whole paralarva or the stylet, as well as to identify strong \n\ncorrelations between the size of the paralarva and measurements of the respective stylet. \n\n \n\n\n\n4.

Results  \n\nAs in adults, the stylets of O. vulgaris paralarvae were located at the insertion of the \n\nfunnel retractor muscles, in the posterior region of the mantle. In relation to those of adults, \n\nin paralarvae these structures were situated more dorsally and mid region of the mantle \n\n(Figure 4.2). In the paralarva, the stylet bend (where the primordium of the structure is \n\nlocated) was found to lie between 100 ?m and 200 ?m from the tip of the mantle.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 \u2013 Transverse section (A) of an Octopus vulgaris paralarva (magnification: 400x).

Due \n\nto its ?-chitin nature similar to cartilage tissue, the stylet appeared stained in most \n\nparalarvae sections as green/blue. The stylet is anterior-posteriorly oriented in the mantle \n\nwith the anterior branch (or rostrum) inserted deep inside the mantle muscle, the bend was \n\nlocated inside the mantle \u2013 funnel retractor muscle insertion, and the post-rostral branch \n\npositioned more superficially along the interior wall of the mantle (Figure 4.3). Several \n\norientation experiments were made to obtain the best section of the stylet, frontal (Figure \n\n4.3), sagittal (Figure 4.4) and transversal planes of the paralarva (Figure 5). Although both \n\nsagittal and transversal plane sections gave good results in terms of locating the \n\nprimordium, the transversal section improved the chances of obtaining good cross sections \n\nof the stylet near the bend (Figure 4.5). This transversal plane allowed firstly to identify the \n\nstylet at the bend level in the mantle-funnel retractor muscle insertion and then to identify \n\nthe best section where it was possible to detect the hatch check in the stylet and to measure \n\nthe diameter, perimeter, area and major radius of the stylet. \n\n\n\n4.

Assessing age in Octopus vulgaris juvenile \n\n \n\n151 \n\n \n\nThe nuclear area previously defined in the captive paralarvae was easily identified in \n\nthe nine stylets of wild paralarvae by its microstructure. In the wild paralarva group, the \n\ndiameter of the stylet measured 5.98 \u00b1 0.95 \u00b5m and the area measured 27.54 \u00b1 8.62 ?m\n2\n. \n\nThe diameter of the stylet nucleus measured 3.02 \u00b1 0.55 \u00b5m, and, it was only possible to \n\nidentify the deposition of one growth increment in the post-nuclear area (Figure 2C) of the \n\nstylets of two wild paralarvae.  \n\nWhen comparing paralarval and stylet measurements between the three-day old \n\ncaptive paralarvae and the unknown age wild paralarvae, statistically significant \n\ndifferences arise.  Paralarvae captured in the Rias Baixas presented significantly higher \n\nmean ML, TL, D-eye and weight in relation to the paralarvae for which the embryologic \n\ndevelopment occurred in captivity. Nevertheless, the diameter of the nucleus did not show \n\nsignificant differences between a combined captive group (\u201c18\u00baC\u201d and \u201c22\u00baC\u201d groups \n\npooled together) and wild paralarvae (Table 4.1). \n\n The comparison between paralarval measurements did not show any significant \n\ncollinearity (Table 4.2).  On the other hand, for the stylet dimensions, significant \n\ncollinearity was found between SD and SP (rs= 0.90, N = 29, P&lt;0.001), between SD and \n\nSA (rs= 1.00, N = 29, P&lt;0.001), between SD and SRmax (rs= 0.94, N = 29, P&lt;0.001), and \n\nbetween SP and SRmax (rs= 0.90, N = 29, p &lt;0.001) (Table 4.2). SRnucleus, was \n\ndependent on SDnucleus, but showed strong independence from other stylet dimensions. \n\nWhen comparing stylet dimensions with other paralarval dimensions, all combinations of \n\nmeasurements presented positive correlations to one another. The stronger correlations \n\npresented were between the diameter of the eye and the diameter and section area of the \n\nstylet and between the weight of the paralarva and stylet diameter and area (Table 4.2).  \n\nTable 4.2 \u2013 Spearman correlation (rs) matrix.

Assessing age in Octopus vulgaris juvenile \n\n \n\n152 \n\n \n\n4.1.4. Discussion \n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first time that the vestigial shell (or stylet) was \n\nidentified in pelagic paralarvae of a merobenthic octopus, proving its formation in a prior \n\nembryonic stage. In the adults of Octopus vulgaris, the stylet is a recognizable structure in \n\nthe dorso-anterior region of the mantle, easily extracted by dissection. However, in newly \n\nhatched individuals, the body size and the fragile structure of non-mineralized chitin of the \n\nstylet make it particularly difficult to collect the stylets by dissection. Several methods to \n\nisolate and collect the stylet from the body of the paralarva were tried, including staining \n\nwith an acetic alcian blue solution, in an adaptation of the method used by Vecchione \n\n(1991) to identify stomach contents in squids. According to that author, alcian blue \n\nefficiently stains cartilaginous structures such as eye rings and funnel/mantle-locking \n\ncartilages in squid paralarvae. We observed that, although the alcian blue successfully \n\nstained the eye lenses of O. vulgaris paralarvae, the staining achieved for the stylets was \n\nnot effective and resulted in unclear structures.  \n\nTo overcome this difficulty and considering the fragile nature of newly-hatched \n\nparalarvae with the beaks and radula still under-developed, we chose to adopt a \n\nhistological approach to obtain and observe sections of the stylets. Nevertheless, other \n\nchallenges arise with this approach. As in adults, the stylets of paralarvae are spine-like \n\nrods with an irregular shape, presenting a middle bended region with concave and convex \n\narms in the insertion area of the mantle-funnel retractor muscles. Both sagittal and \n\ntransversal cutting planes result in good cross sections of the stylet, but only the transversal \n\nplane allowed a greater number of sections in the vicinity of the primordium. Additionally, \n\nthis sectioning plane allowed the definition of a methodology to identify the bend and the \n\nclosest section in which it is possible to identify the nucleus and to measure the structure in \n\na replicable manner. \n\n The nucleus (primordium) is visible in the nearest section to the stylet bend, with a \n\nmean diameter of 2.71 \u00b5m independently of the developmental temperature. The diameter \n\nof the stylet in newly-hatched (three-days old) paralarvae is close to 5 ?m. Under a \n\nmagnification of 1000x, the stylet does not have visible growth rings in the majority of the \n\nsections. In only two stylets of the wild paralarvae group were post-nuclear growth \n\nincrements visible. Smooth core regions seem to be particularly common in stylets of \n\nholobenthic octopus such as O. pallidus (Doubleday et al., 2006) and merobenthic octopus \n\nsuch as Macroctopus maorum (Doubleday et al., 2011). These observations are in \n\n\n\n4. Assessing age in Octopus vulgaris juvenile \n\n \n\n153 \n\n \n\nagreement with observations made in the stylets of adults, where it is possible to identify a \n\ncore region with few irregularly marked increments (Figure 4.6). Nevertheless, one should \n\nhypothesise that the absence of visible growth increments near the nucleus may reflect an \n\ninadequate resolution power of light microscopy to resolve distances of less than 1 ?m \n\n(Campana, 1992; Doubleday et al., 2011) rather than an actual feature of the structure. The \n\nuse of scanning electronic microscopy associated with cryo-sectioning of the paralarvae \n\ncould be useful tools to improve the analysis of the stylet. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.6 \u2013 Octopus vulgaris juvenile and adult stylet sections showing the central area which corresponds \n\nin size to the stylet diameter at hatching (magnification 630x). SD \u2013 diameter of the stylet at hatching; A \u2013 \n\nstylet section of a juvenile weighing 384 g (SD = 3.5 ?m); B \u2013 stylet section of a juvenile weighting 700 gr \n\n(SD = 3.39 ?m).  \n\n \n\nIn Octopus vulgaris a merobenthic species, both stylet diameter and nuclear region of \n\nhatchlings are considerably smaller than in O. pallidus, a holobenthic species, but identical \n\nto stylet sizes and characteristics described by Doubleday et al. (2011) for Macroctopus \n\nmaorum, a merobenthic octopus living in temperate and subantarctic waters off the \n\nAustralian coast. In comparison with O. pallidus, O. vulgaris hatchlings are small and \n\npelagic until settlement 30 to 60 days after hatching (Villanueva, 1995; Villanueva &amp; \n\nNorman, 2008), while O. pallidus hatchlings are larger in relation to their adults and \n\nbenthic from hatching. This results in two orders of magnitude difference in weight (2 mg \n\nweight for O. vulgaris hatchlings vs. 0.10 to 0.54 g for O. pallidus hatchlings, Semmens et \n\nal. 2011) at hatching and fully accounts for size differences between stylet diameter and \n\nnuclear area. Such differences illustrate the importance of investigating and validating \n\ngrowth structures and check marks in the stylets of each species. \n\n\n\n4. Assessing age in Octopus vulgaris juvenile \n\n \n\n154 \n\n \n\nComparing our observations between O. vulgaris paralarva and juvenile stylet \n\nsections it is possible to observe correspondences of the nuclear area among the two life \n\nstages (Figure 6). In the juveniles, the identified nucleus ranges between 3 and 5 ?m in \n\ndiameter, followed by a smooth region where growth increments are hardly visible, \n\nnecessarily larger than observed in these paralarvae. Nevertheless, the dimensions of the \n\nnuclear area are within the same range in both stages (paralarvae and juveniles).  \n\n The three day-old captivity-hatched paralarvae of which the embryologic \n\ndevelopment was conducted under controlled temperatures did not show significant \n\ndifferences in either body size or stylet dimensions. These findings are consistent with \n\nresults obtained in laboratory essays under similar developmental temperatures: 18\u00baC and \n\n21\u00baC. Although embryos at warmer temperatures grow faster and hatch earlier, hatchlings \n\ndo not present significant differences in size or weight (Baptista et al., pers. comm.). It is \n\nimportant to note that these paralarvae were not fed during the first three days of life, \n\nwhich could influence growth. Working with squid, Vidal et al. (2002) suggested that in \n\nthe first hours to days of life, even if they start to feed, paralarvae depend almost entirely \n\non their yolk reserves, going through a two-stage critical period with a \u201cno net growth\u201d, \n\ncomprised of a negative phase (decreasing in weight) and a posterior positive phase \n\n(weight recovery). In our study, the paralarvae were not fed and there was no recovery \n\nphase, so only a negative grow-phase was present. However the two groups might have \n\nbeen different at hatching and different net negative growth phase between the 18\u00baC and \n\n22\u00baC could have resulted in similar weights and sizes at the end of the three days. \n\n We were not able to determine the age of the nine paralarvae captured in the Cies \n\nIslands. Those paralarvae were in all cases larger in size and weight than the ones hatched \n\nin captivity, indicating that they may be over three-days old. The results of studies \n\nconducted by Villanueva (1995) with O. vulgaris hatchlings reared at 21\u00baC, suggest that \n\nthese paralarvae could be approximately 10-days old (Figure 4.7). Nevertheless, these \n\nlarvae were captured in July and October experiencing mean surface temperatures between \n\n16.5 \u00baC (for the July paralarvae) and 19.2 \u00baC (for the October paralarvae) during \n\nembryologic development (SST data source: Seawatch buoy located off Cape Silleiro , 42\u00ba \n\n7.80 N, 9\u00ba 23.40 W, www.puertos.es). This means that on average these paralarvae \n\nexperienced lower temperatures that those in captivity, resulting in a longer embryologic \n\ndevelopment (Villanueva &amp; Norman, 2008; Moreno et al., 2012) and therefore larger sizes \n\nat hatching (Leporati et al., 2007). Even though the nucleus is the same diameter between \n\n\n\n4. Assessing age in Octopus vulgaris juvenile \n\n \n\n155 \n\n \n\nwild-caught and captive-hatched paralarvae, body size, stylet area and diameter and major \n\nradius are all larger in the wild paralarvae, which indicates that deposition of new material \n\nin the stylet after hatching had occurred, although no increments were observed. One can \n\nhypothesize that at this stage the deposition of growth increments does not happen daily or \n\nthat their contrast is not sufficient to show. During the paralarval stage, individuals go \n\nthrough a dramatic change from endogenous feeding to exogeneous feeding (Boletzky, \n\n2003; Villanueva &amp; Norman, 2008) associated to a no-net growth (Moguel et al., 2010) \n\nand a learning to hunt process that is not cyclic. Either during this process growth \n\nincrement deposition depends on other factors that are not regulated by circadian \n\nmechanisms, or the composition of the deposition layers is not very different. Either \n\npossibility may have resulted in a single increment deposition having been observed in two \n\nparalarvae.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.7 - Comparison of the mean weight of Octopus vulgaris paralarvae of known age reared under \n\ndifferent temperatures (18\u00baC 3day, 22\u00baC 3day, 21\u00baC 1 day* and 21\u00baC 3 day*). Data for the 21\u00baC 1 and 21\u00baC \n\n10 day paralarvae were published in Villanueva (1995). \n\n \n\nDespite the significant differences in paralarvae and stylet measurements between \n\ngroups, the dimension of the nuclear region in the stylet seem to be conservative between \n\nthem and independent of both biological and environmental factors, suggesting that the \n\nnuclear region (corresponding to stylet size at hatching) can be used as a reference point to \n\ndetermine age and growth and related measurements.

Assessing age in Octopus vulgaris juvenile \n\n \n\n160 \n\n \n\n4.2.1. Introduction \n\nAge and growth estimates are essential to understand the biology and ecology of \n\nmarine organisms. These estimates are important for stock assessment using population \n\nage structured models, longevity and mortality models, productivity and recruitment \n\nmodels, all important tools for sustainable fisheries management. Ecologically, the \n\nassessment of age and growth rates permit the determination of the duration of crucial life \n\nstages (e.g. paralarva), and the timing of important transitional stages (e.g. settlement). \n\nFurthermore, environmental impacts on growth can be assessed based on age and growth \n\nestimates throughout the species life cycle. \n\nIn cephalopods, estimates of age and growth have been conducted applying both \n\nindirect methods based in demographic and modal progression methods and direct methods \n\nfrom hard structures. The direct methods of age estimation are based on counts of growth \n\nincrements (GI) in the statoliths (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 1996; Moreno et al., 2005), beaks \n\n(Perales-Raya et al., 2010; 2014; Canali et al., 2011), internal shell (R\u00e9 &amp; Narciso, 1994) \n\nand the stylets (vestigial shell) supported by a few studies associated to mark-recapture and \n\ndaily deposition validation techniques (see Semmens et al., 2004, and Boyle &amp; Rodhouse, \n\n2006 for a review). Additionally, some biochemical and histochemical methods have been \n\nused to assess individual age in cephalopods as the RNA/protein ratio in Eledone cirrhosa \n\nand Octopus vulgaris (Pierce et al., 1999) and lipofuscin pigment concentration in the \n\noptic gland of O. pallidus (Doubleday &amp; Semmens, 2011).  \n\nIn Incirrate octopods such as O. vulgaris, direct ageing methods based on statolith \n\nincrement analysis are not considered accurate, while approaches using beaks still need \n\naccuracy validation, in particular due to erosion by feeding (Perales-Raya et al., 2010, \n\n2014; Canali et al., 2011). \n\nThe use of the stylets to assess age has been trialed in the past (e.g. Reis &amp; \n\nFernandes, 2002) with improvements achieved in the preservation and observation \n\ntechniques in transversal sections of these structures. Today, age estimation by stylet \n\nincrement analysis (SIA) is considered a successful and promising method to assess age in \n\nwild populations of octopus species (e.g. O. pallidus, Leporati et al., 2008; Macroctopus \n\nmaorum, Doubleday et al., 2011, O. cyanea, Herwig et al., 2012;). Important contributions \n\non validation of daily deposition of GI in O. pallidus were made by Doubleday et al. \n\n(2006) and Leporati et al., (2008) and in O. vulgaris by Hermosilla et al. (2010). Recent \n\nimprovements in stylet preparation methods that resulted in the production of good quality \n\n\n\n4. Assessing age in Octopus vulgaris juvenile \n\n \n\n161 \n\n \n\nand definitive sections (Barratt &amp; Allcock, 2010) definitively push forward the use of SIA \n\nto estimate age in octopus species. \n\nDespite the growing number of studies on age and growth based on the count of \n\ngrowth increments in transverse sections of stylets in incirrate octopods, few efforts have \n\nbeen conducted to follow identical counting protocols between species as is the case of age \n\nstudies based on fish otoliths (Panfili et al., 2002). The definition of a protocol for ageing \n\npurposes allows comparisons to be made between different populations of the same species \n\nor between species with different life strategies, e.g. compare growth and lifespan \n\nestimates between holobenthic and merobenthic species. \n\nO. vulgaris is a merobenthic species (Mangold, 1983) with a short life cycle of one \n\n(Iglesias et al., 2004; Perales-Raya et al., 2014) to two years (Katsanevakis &amp; \n\nVerriopoulos, 2006; Otero et al., 2007). The paralarvae are planktonic and settle to the \n\nbenthic habitat (weighing 173 mg) 32 to 57 days after hatching (Villanueva, 1995; Iglesias \n\net al., 2004; Katsanevakis &amp; Verriopoulos, 2006). Upon settling grow rates are high, at \n\napproximately 1.2-1.6% d\n-1\n\n, allowing animals to reach the fisheries legal minimum landing \n\nweight (750 g in Portugal, Portaria n\u00ba 27/2001) at 9-10 months of age (Domain et al., 2000; \n\nKatsanevakis &amp; Verriopoulos, 2006). The stylet develops throughout embryogenesis, \n\nprobably as a single piece (Budelmann et al., 1997; Naef, 1921, 1923 in Bizikov, 2004) \n\nand at hatching it is located in the dorso-anterior region of the mantle (Louren\u00e7o et al., \n\nunpublished data). \n\nThe present study aims to estimate the age of O. vulgaris juveniles (pre-recruits) of \n\nthe Portuguese northwest coast (western Iberian upwelling system, WIUS) using SIA. \n\nSecondly, it aims to provide a protocol for stylet preparation and SIA methods, based on \n\nDoubleday et al. (2006) and Barratt &amp; Allcock (2010) and the daily deposition validation \n\nconducted by Hermosilla et al. (2010), such that repeated and comparable age estimates \n\ncan be made between populations and between various incirrate octopods species to a \n\nhigher precision than hereto possible, providing greater ageing accuracy.  \n\n \n\n4.2.2. Material and methods \n\n4.2.2.1. Sampling and storing \n\nTwenty-eight stylets collected from pre-recruits weighing between 99 g and 748 g \n\ncaptured in the small-scale fisheries were stored in a 4% formalin solution. For each \n\n\n\n4. Assessing age in Octopus vulgaris juvenile \n\n \n\n162 \n\n \n\nindividual (yielding a pair of stylets), dorsal mantle length (DML in mm) and total weight \n\n(W in g) were measured to the nearest mm and 0.1 g, respectively. Sex and maturity stage \n\nwere macroscopically evaluated whenever possible.  \n\nPrevious studies have highlighted that storing solutions are a key issue in the prevention of \n\nstylet degradation and improvement of GI visualization (Sousa-Reis &amp; Fernandes, 2002). \n\nTo find the best storing solution, two sets of stylets were stored in a 3:1 mixture of 70% \n\nethanol and glycerol (solution A), and in a 4% formalin solution (solution B). The core \n\nregion of several stylets stored in solution A appeared darkened, layers were easily \n\nseparated from each other during preparation due to drying, and no improvement in the \n\nvisualization of GI was observed. Solution B revealed to be a better storing solution: \n\ndrying was less significant and counting of GI comparatively easier. \n\n \n\n4.2.2.2. Stylet preparation \n\nBefore resin embedding, the entire stylet was dehydrated in sequential baths of 70%, \n\n80% and 100% ethanol for two hours each. After dehydration, a section of the stylet with \n\nroughly 1 cm long (including the stylet bend) was cut towards the post-rostral region. The \n\nsection was then embedded in a low-viscosity acrylic resin (LR White\nTM\n\n) for 24 h in an \n\nEppendorf after Barratt &amp; Allcock (2010). Following resin infiltration, the stylet section \n\nwas removed from the solution and placed horizontally in a plastic histology mould. \n\nApproximately 50 ml of fresh resin was polymerized using 5 drops of accelerator solution \n\n(LR White\nTM\n\n UV accelerator) filling up the mould until the stylet section was completely \n\ncovered. The section orientation inside the mould was corrected before resin hardening. \n\nThis operation was conducted over a cold plate at \u2013 8 \u00baC to prevent resin overheating. The \n\nembedded stylets were left overnight to polymerize. After polymerization, the resin blocks \n\nwere removed from the plastic moulds, lined up over a fresh epoxy resin layer and oriented \n\nvertically with the stylet bend facing up. They were then covered with transparent epoxy \n\nresin and left to dry overnight. The new epoxy resin block was cut with a variable speed \n\nprecision cutting machine (Extec's Labcut 250B) blade producing 500 ?m transversal \n\nsections of the stylets. This new step was introduced in the procedure following the \n\nprotocols designed by Doubleday et al. (2006) and Barratt &amp; Allcock (2010). It facilitates \n\nthe production of identical 500 \u00b5m stylet sections, minimizing the occurrence of variable \n\nsection thicknesses which would require considerable time in grinding. The 500 \u00b5m \n\nsections were then removed from the base resin, mounted onto a glass slide with Neo-\n\n\n\n4. Assessing age in Octopus vulgaris juvenile \n\n \n\n163 \n\n \n\nMount\nR\n and left to dry for a further 24 h untill completely hard. They were then further \n\nground and polished with a sequence 1200-grade Carborundum fine sandpaper, followed \n\nby a sequence of 30, 9 and 3 \u00b5m lapping film and finally wet neoprene impregnated with a \n\nsolution of 0.05 \u00b5m aluminum oxide powder and distilled water (after Barratt &amp; Allcock, \n\n2010). During polishing, the sections were checked under a light microscope (100 and \n\n400x magnification) until GI, nucleus and core region were visible, while making sure they \n\nwould not get polished away. \n\n \n\n4.2.2.3. Stylet microstructure analysis and age estimation \n\nStylet microstructure and GI were observed at 100 and 625x magnifications using a \n\nZeiss Axioplan 2 Imaging light microscope. Sequential digital images of the whole stylet \n\nsection were captured under 100x magnification with a Zeiss Axiocam MRC digital \n\ncamera and composed digitally using ImageJ plugin MosaicJ (Th\u00e9venaz &amp; Unser, 2007). \n\nThe nucleus was identified in 13 stylets and appeared in the center of the stylet as a \n\ndark portion limited by the first growth discontinuity or check identified by the a colour \n\nchange from dark to light grey. The diameter of this portion was on average 5.8 \u00b1 2.2 \u00b5m, \n\nsimilar to the diameter of the stylet of a three-day old paralarva (3.99 \u00b1 0.96 \u00b5m, Louren\u00e7o \n\net al., unpublished data). Considering that this was the first growth discontinuity visible \n\nafter the nucleus, we considered it the hatch check (Louren\u00e7o et al., unpublished data). \n\nThe transversal section of the stylet presented an irregular shape and the nucleus \n\ndivided the stylet surface in two unequal parts. In order to have reproducible GI counts, \n\ntwo reading segments were defined along the stylet\u2019s major axis and called large segment \n\nand small segment depending of the length of each. \n\nThe core region was identified in all stylets as the region between the hatch check \n\nand the second growth discontinuity. The core region was defined as a smooth region \n\nwhere none or few growth increments were visible due to increments low contrast. The \n\ncore region presented a variable diameter, ending where regular deposition of the GI is \n\nvisible under the microscope.  \n\nMeasurements of the area, perimeter, major axis, minor axis, core region (radius) and \n\nnucleus (diameter) were taken from the scaled mosaics (Figure 4.8) and compared to \n\nindividual weight, dorsal mantle length and number of GI. The assumption of normality \n\nand homogeneity of the variables was assessed with Shapiro-Wilk\u2019s and Bartlett\u00b4s tests, \n\n\n\n4. Assessing age in Octopus vulgaris juvenile \n\n \n\n164 \n\n \n\nrespectively, and the correlation matrix of the dimensions was obtained applying the \n\nPearson correlation index. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.8 \u2013 Octopus vulgaris stylet section with the indication of measurements of area, perimeter, minor \n\naxis and major axis with arrows indicating of the large and small counting segments along the stylet\u2019s major \n\naxis (mosaic of images with 100x magnification).   \n\nGI were observed under bright light, with the condenser adjusted to optimize \n\nbrightness and contrast. To count GI in each stylet, a sequential series of 625x \n\nmagnification grayscale images were captured along the stylet\u2019s major axis and composed \n\ndigitally using the ImageJ plugin MosaicJ (Th\u00e9venaz&amp; Unser, 2007).  \n\nBased on the validation conducted by Hermosilla et al. (2010) of the daily deposition \n\nof GI in the stylets of O. vulgaris, GI counts were conducted under 625x magnifications \n\nalong the small and large segments. A daily GI was defined as the set of a light grey (or \n\nwhite) band followed by a dark ring and the increment count was marked in the latter. At \n\nthis stage, the first increment was defined as the nearest clear dark ring after the nucleus \n\ndefining the end of the core region (Figure 4.9 A). The last increment was defined as the \n\nmost marginal dark ring. The light band was always wider than the dark ring, and \n\nfrequently presented several very fine dark rings or shadows within it, that were considered \n\n\n\n4. Assessing age in Octopus vulgaris juvenile \n\n \n\n165 \n\n \n\nsub-daily growth increments (Figure 4.9B).  \n\nThe distance between consecutive increments was determined by dividing the \n\ndistance between the first GI and the last GI by the number of GI counted. To asses if the \n\nnumber of increments counted was independent of the axis length, three independent \n\ncounts were made on both large and small axis. The segment length and correspondent \n\ncounts were statistically compared by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and differences \n\nfound between segment counts were assessed by a paired t-Student test for differences \n\nbetween group means. \n\nFigure 4.9 \u2013 Detail of the cross section microstructure of Octopus vulgaris stylets (625x magnification).

The precision can be assessed by the average percent error (APE), the \n\nindex of precision (D) or by the coefficient of variation (CV). The CV tends to be the \n\npreferential method used for microstructure studies because it is more robust and more \n\nsensitive to differences between observers (Campana, 2001). The CV can be written as \n\n\n\n4. Assessing age in Octopus vulgaris juvenile \n\n \n\n166 \n\n \n\n(Campana, 2001) : \n\n??? = 100% \u00d7\n\n?\n?\n\n(??????)\n2\n\n??1\n?\n?=1\n\n??\n, where CVj is the estimate for age precision of the jth stylet. \n\nXij is the ith age determination of the jth stylet, Xj is the mean age estimate for the jth \n\nstylet, and R is the number of times each stylet is aged. The CV of age estimates was \n\ndetermined per observer based on three independent GI counts made by experienced \n\nobservers (A) (CVWO) and between observers by comparing the mean GI counts of \n\nobserver A with an independent GI count of a second experienced observer (B) (CVBO). \n\nAdditionally, the relative precision between readers was tested by comparing the slopes \n\nand intercepts of regressions of number of GI on axis length, as determined by each reader, \n\nthrough an analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) (Quinn &amp; Keough, 2002). \n\n The GI counts results obtained by observer A over the large segment were used to fit \n\ndifferent growth models. To describe the growth of O. vulgaris after settlement, four \n\ndifferent growth models (linear, exponential, logarithmic and power models) were fitted to \n\nthe weight-at-age data. The best fit model was selected by checking the model fit residuals \n\nfor normality with Shapiro-Wilk\u2019s test and by calculating the Akaike Information Criterion \n\n(AIC) of fitted results (Zuur et al., 2007). Post-settlement instantaneous growth rates \n\n(IGR\u2019s) were calculated on an individual basis but averaged over the lifetime based on the \n\nequation determined by Forsythe &amp; Van Heukelem (1987): \nt\n\nWW\nIGR\n\nif\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\nlnln\n , where \n\nt?  is the age determined for each individual of Wf total weight at capture. Wi was assumed \n\nto be 173 mg, based on the average weight of 40 day-old O. vulgaris, the weight at age of \n\nsettlement estimated by Villanueva (1995) in laboratory rearing experiments. \n\n \n\n4.2.3. Results: \n\n \n\nThe stylet dimensions, minor axis, major axis, perimeter and area are highly \n\ncorrelated with each other and with the juveniles\u2019 dml and weight.

Discussion: \n\nThe methodology used to prepare the stylets to SIA was time consuming and \n\nproduced a 21% loss of material. The introduction of the automated 500 \u00b5m section was an \n\nimprovement regarding the previous age studies with SIA (Barrat &amp; Allcock, 2010; \n\nDoubleday et al., 2006). However, the high percentage of stylet damage from layer \n\ndetachment is still high, making this a time and material demanding technique. Reducing \n\nthe storing time prior to sectioning can probably reduce detachment from layer \n\ndehydration, but the discontinued nature of the layered deposition of the stylet matrix will \n\nalways be a limiting factor for the optimization of the technique. \n\n \n\n\n\n4. Assessing age in Octopus vulgaris juvenile \n\n \n\n171 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.13 - Growth model (A) and instantaneous growth rate model (B) fits to Octopus vulgaris juvenile \n\nweight \u2013 at \u2013age data. \n\n \n\nAge estimation based on SIA now appears to be a promising accurate method when \n\nused for octopus species. Since the preliminary work conducted by Sousa-Reis &amp; \n\nFernandes (2002), several advances in methodological approaches have been achieved, \n\nincluding the possibility to prepare permanent resin embedded sections (Barratt &amp; Allcock, \n\n2010) and the daily deposition validation in holobenthic (Doubleday et al., 2006; Leporati \n\net al., 2007) and merobenthic (Hermosilla et al., 2010) octopods. In fact, the possibility to \n\nhave permanent section preparations assures samples will remain available for continued \n\nimprovements to observation protocols. Here, for the first time, independent GI counts \n\nwere conducted in different regions of the stylet proving that the choice of the region of \n\ninterest to conduct GI counts is determining to age assessing particularly in the most \n\nirregular stylet sections. \n\n Since the daily deposition of GI in stylets has been validated by Hermosilla et al. \n\n(2010) for O. vulgaris, this is the first study in which wild post-settled juveniles were aged \n\nwith SIA. According to our results, post-settlement O. vulgaris took a minimum of eight \n\nmonths to reach the 750 g minimum landing size required from Portuguese legislation. The \n\naverage instantaneous growth rate estimated during this period is 6.26% per day, but IGR \n\ndecreases continuously from settlement, following a power function. \n\n Albeit promising for the accurate and precise assessment of the age of O. vulgaris, \n\nthe described SIA methodologies require the establishment of specific protocols. The prior \n\ndefinition of a region of interest (ROI) in the stylet surface facilitates precise age estimates \n\nusing SIA because it removes a source of variability, since the distance between GI can \n\nvary. Since GI were visible in more than 90 % of the stylet surface, and the major axis \n\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n100 150 200\n\nGI\n\nw\ne\n\nig\nh\n\nt \n(g\n\n)\n\nBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n200 400 600\n\nweight (g)\n\nIG\nR\n\n\n\n4. Assessing age in Octopus vulgaris juvenile \n\n \n\n172 \n\n \n\n(with the greatest distance between GI) was therefore established a priori as the ROI for \n\ncounts. Stylet section shape is asymmetric and, in most cases, the nucleus is not located at \n\nthe center of the structure, resulting in counting segments with different lengths depending \n\nof their position in relation to the nucleus. Observers tend to use the distance between \n\nincrements as the main criterion to distinguish daily from sub-daily growth increments, and \n\ntherefore the counts produced over different length segments tend to be different and the \n\ndifference increases with increasing length differences between segments. In age studies \n\nconducted with squid statoliths, the more frequent ROI defined a priori is the region \n\nbetween the nucleus an the rostrum in the lateral dome of the statoliths (Lipinski &amp; \n\nDurholtz, 1994; Arkhipkin &amp; Bjorke, 2000; Moreno et al., 2005) for similar reasons. \n\nDespite our best efforts, a mean CV of 9% between observers was the most precise \n\nestimate achieved, which is considerably high in comparison with age studies on other \n\noctopus species (Herwig et al., 2012; Leporati et al., 2008). The associated error can \n\ntherefore produce underestimated ages by 3% to 4%, considering a theoretical life span of \n\nbetween 18 months (Domain et al., 2000) and two years (Katsanevakis and Verriopoulos, \n\n2006; Otero et al., 2007).  \n\nThe use of a magnification of 625x permitted the identification of the nucleus in only \n\n59 % of the stylets observed (13 sections). The nucleus presents characteristics which \n\nresemble in size those of the stylet at hatching, as previously defined. However, the \n\nnucleus of the stylets observed in the present study, with a mean diameter of 5.80 \u00b5m, are \n\nstatistically different (t = -2.78, df = 15.12, p-value = 0.01) from the stylet diameter of \n\nthree-day old paralarvae (3.99 \u00b5m, Louren\u00e7o et al., unpublished data). In comparison with \n\nthe holobenthic species O. pallidus (Doubleday et al., 2006) the nuclear area of the stylets \n\nof O. vulgaris, which would correspond to hatching size, is proportionately smaller, \n\nsimilarly to the ratio of post-hatching size / adult size of the two species. This extremely \n\nsmall size in conjunction with the existence of the core region, which has not yet been fully \n\nexplained, may account for the verified difference in size between hatching stylet diameter \n\nand nuclear diameter in juvenile and adult specimens.  \n\nThe stylet nucleus is located at the center of the core region, which is defined as a \n\nsmooth, mostly unmarked (due to low contrast increments) area of variable size. The core \n\nregion ends with the deposition of a checkmark which marks the beginning of a regular \n\ndeposition of rings that extend to the outer edge of the stylet. Number of GI, distance \n\nbetween GI and core region size all seem to be independent of stylet section size and \n\n\n\n4. Assessing age in Octopus vulgaris juvenile \n\n \n\n173 \n\n \n\noctopus size suggesting that post-core ring deposition is the only source of a relationship \n\nbetween section size and octopus size (and in some way age). The core region has also \n\nbeen identified in M. maorum, another merobenthic octopus (Doubleday et al., 2011b). \n\nBased on knowledge of the pre-hatching formation of the stylet and its size in three-day \n\nold paralarvae (Louren\u00e7o et al., unpublished data), it is possible to hypothesize that the \n\ncore region is formed throughout a relatively long period after hatching, while the \n\nparalarva undergoes its pelagic existence, and that probably the first checkmark is layed \n\nwhen the paralarva changes into a juvenile at settlement to the benthic habitat. In fact, the \n\nradius of the core region was on average 382 \u00b5m. Considering that the mean distance \n\nbetween GI was estimated to be 4.29 \u00b5m and assuming that the GI deposition was regular \n\nduring the entire life of the juveniles, we can estimate that at least 88 GI could be deposited \n\nbetween hatch and settlement marks, corresponding to about 3 months. Although, \n\nrepresenting a significantly longer paralarval stage than the results obtained by Villanueva \n\n(1995) on captive paralarvae would suggest (they settled 60 days after hatching), it is in \n\nline with estimates made by Katsanevakis and Verriopoulos (2006) from density studies, \n\nwhich indicated paralarval stage lengths of three to four months depending on water \n\ntemperature (colder waters leading to longer paralarval stages). \n\nSupport for a conservative nuclear size has been gained from this study, which in \n\nturn would support a conservation of the hatchling stylet diameter as the nucleus of the \n\ndeveloping structure. It is then possible that the core region somewhat masks nuclear \n\ndimensions, making it more difficult to determine nuclear dimensions in larger individuals. \n\nAlbeit generally featureless, 5 to 23 low contrasts GI are usually visible in the core \n\nregion. It would therefore stand to reason that whatever dictates the deposition of GI, either \n\ntheir period or their characteristics vary throughout the life of the individual. Therefore, in \n\ncomplement to the validation of the daily deposition of GI in adults, it is also necessary to \n\nattempt to validate it in other life stages. During juvenile and adult life stages, the animals \n\nare benthic and the daily deposition of GI is probably related with the circadian activity \n\ncontrolled by the light cycle, even if directly it is dictated by hunting or actual feeding \n\nsuccess (Wells et al., 1983; Meisel et al., 2003). If factors such as feeding success play a \n\nrole, the variability of possible outcomes may also explain the variability observed in the \n\nthickness and other characteristics of the individual GI. Paralarvae are pelagic, and other \n\nthan being subject to external cues, they may also modulate these cues via their own \n\nbehaviour, collectively the zeitgeber, which includes dial migrations, light or temperature \n\n\n\n4. Assessing age in Octopus vulgaris juvenile \n\n \n\n174 \n\n \n\ncycles, feeding success, etc., all of which influence their metabolism during this stage. \n\nConsidering those differences in the external factors that influence behaviour and \n\nmetabolism, it is essential to take validation methods to another level (Doubleday et al., \n\n2011b) in order to adequately interpret the whole extent of the assumed age record. \n\nIndividuals weighing between 99 g and 748 g take 59 to 219 days after settlement to \n\nattain those weights. Having in mind that complete age results might be underestimated \n\ndue to the difficulties in identifying daily GI in the core region, up to 3 months should be \n\nadded relating to the paralarval stage. We therefore estimate that such juveniles might be \n\nconservatively aged at 5 to 10 months. These age estimates are higher than those obtained \n\nby Perales-Raya et al. (2010, 2014) for the same weight range from beak growth increment \n\nanalysis. The O. vulgaris population of the Central East Atlantic studied by Perales-Raya et \n\nal. (2010, 2014) is subject to higher environmental temperatures than those experienced by \n\nthe population studied here (which is influenced by the Western Iberian upwelling system - \n\nWIUS). Different environmental temperatures are known to influence growth rates \n\n(Forsythe, 1993), lower temperatures leading to slower weight gains. This could explain \n\nthe different results obtained here in comparison with Perales-Raya et al. (2010). On the \n\nother hand, age estimates conducted by Canali et al. (2011) in beaks of population of O. \n\nvulgaris from the Bay of Naples (western Mediterranean Sea) show that animals weighing \n\non average 350 g are aged between 72 days and 371 days, a wide age range for such small \n\nanimals, even considering that Mediterranean populations attain smaller sizes than Atlantic \n\npopulations (Quetglas et al., 1998). Studies on beak growth increments, such as those \n\nconducted by Perales-Raya et al. (2010, 2014) and Canali et al. (2011) are however \n\nsometimes also questioned due to the unknown level of beak increment erosion induced by \n\nfeeding. \n\nDespite the high variability in age estimates, the model that best explained growth at \n\nthis pre-maturity stage was the logarithmic model. This is in accordance with the review \n\nconducted by Forsythe &amp; Van Heukelem (1987) for laboratory-based growth in cephalopod \n\nspecies in general. They show that growth in benthic octopods occurs in two phases, the \n\nfirst being exponential, and the second logarithmic. During the logarithmic phase, \n\nindividuals were never shown to reach an asymptote, contrary to the study of Domain et al. \n\n(2000), but growth rates decreased progressively. In the present study, the instantaneous \n\ngrowth rate estimated with a power model was on average 6.26 % d\n-1\n\n, which is low when \n\ncompared to estimates by Iglesias et al. (2004) for captive animals and high when \n\n\n\n4. Assessing age in Octopus vulgaris juvenile \n\n \n\n175 \n\n \n\ncompared to the direct estimates by Domain et al. (2000) or the demographic model \n\nproduced by Katsanevakis &amp; Verriopoulos (2006).  \n\n The variability in age estimates obtained through different methods highlights the \n\nimportance of validation studies, among which those based on wild-caught specimens \n\nwould be particularly relevant (Perales-Raya et al., 2014). Validations of daily deposition \n\nof GI in different stages of the life cycle are then also necessary. In the case of O. vulgaris \n\n(and possibly other merobenthic species) this validation is essential to understand the \n\ndifferences that are apparent in different regions of the stylet. \n\n Finally, adequate ageing protocols are also essential to allow repeatable and \n\ncomparable exercises between octopus populations and researchers. The definition a priori \n\nof count areas (e.g. the larger segment of the major axis) will enhance counts comparison \n\nwithin and between individuals (or populations). Additionally, improving the structures \n\ncontrast introducing differential interference contrast filters to the observation with the \n\n400x and 625x magnification objectives will improve the GI contrast particularly in the \n\ncore region, which is, at this stage, the most difficult and demanding stylet region in terms \n\nof identification and GI counting. Hand-in-hand with the validation of GI deposition in the \n\nparalarval stage, the increasing contrast of the GI laid in the stylet will be the most \n\nsignificant methodological aspect to improve to obtain precise and accurate age estimates \n\nto the Incirrate octopuses\u2019 species.          \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\n The first author wants to acknowledge Mestre Ars\u00e9nio for his help with the juveniles collection, \n\nAnt\u00f3nio Pedro Mendon\u00e7a for his assistance with biological sampling and Andreia Silva, Isabel Meneses and \n\nMarcos Regueira for their help with stylets observations, growth increment counts and hours of discussion \n\nabout the best way of conduct SIA on octopus stylets.

General Conclusions \n\n \n\n181 \n\n \n\n5. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS  \n\n \n\n5.1.  GENERAL CONCLUSIONS  \n \n\nThe Octopus vulgaris population of the northeastern Atlantic is very important from \n\na socioeconomic perspective. The coastal fishing communities of Portugal and Galicia fish \n\nan average of 14 911 tons of common octopus each year (FAO 2014; INE 2013) mainly \n\nthrough the small-scale fishing fleet (Freire &amp; Garc??a-Allut, 2000; ICES 2012a), and \n\nincreasingly in the latest years, the bottom-trawling fleet (Fonseca et al., 2008). \n\nCharacterized by high abundance variability mainly related with the impact of different \n\nenvironmental factors in the paralarval and juvenile stages (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2005; Otero et \n\nal., 2008; 2009; Sobrino et al., 2002; Sonderblohm et al., 2014), the resilience of the \n\nspecies to heavy fishing is, most certainly, related with its plastic life-strategy (Hastie et \n\nal., 2009), the highly productive coastal conditions of the Northeastern Atlantic coastal \n\nbasin (Ar\u00edstegui et al., 2009; Garc\u00eda Lafuente &amp; Ruiz, 2007; Relvas et al., 2007), the \n\nopportunistic feeding behaviour of the adults (Quetglas et al., 1998) and the availability of \n\nseveral potential prey assemblages (Sousa et al., 2005).  \n\nIn the coastal basin of the northeast Atlantic, Octopus vulgaris spawn year-round \n\n(Hastie et al., 2009). Nevertheless, the northeast Atlantic population presents seasonal \n\ntrends that differ from north to south. While in Galician waters the population spawns \n\nmainly in spring (Otero et al., 2007), we observed that in southern waters near \n\nEstremadura Promontory (39\u00ba N) the spawning season extends from early spring until the \n\nend of summer, with intensity peaks in February-April and  June-July, coupled to seasonal \n\nupwelling (Louren\u00e7o et al., 2012). In the southern section of the Iberian Atlantic basin  the \n\nspawning season is shorter occurring in summer and peaking in September (Louren\u00e7o et \n\nal., 2012) similarly to neighbouring eastern waters between the River Guadiana mouth and \n\nC\u00e1diz (Silva et al., 2002). In this area, the primary production seasonality is not as \n\npronounced, being mainly driven by the west-east wind pattern, river runoff associated to \n\nraining periods and strong water column stratification with significant warming of sea \n\nsurface waters (Garc\u00eda Lafuente &amp; Ruiz, 2007; Ruiz et al., 2006). The O. vulgaris \n\npopulation takes advantage of these conditions, channelling more energy for spawning in a \n\nshorter period of time (higher Gonad-somatic index attained by females in this area), in the \n\n\n\n5. General Conclusions \n\n \n\n182 \n\n \n\nend of summer, timing paralarval hatching to winter, when the predominant westerly winds \n\nfavour the transport of nutrients and zooplankton near to the Cape St\u00aa Maria (Ruiz et al., \n\n2006).   \n\nOn an individual basis, females and males seem to have different reproductive \n\nstrategies. Males attain maturity at smaller sizes (Louren\u00e7o et al., 2012) and maintain \n\nspawning capacity for a longer period than females (both to senescence). Females couple \n\ntheir reproductive strategy with environmental conditions (Louren\u00e7o et al., 2012) \n\nguaranteeing the best survival chances for their offspring. The onset of maturation and \n\nenergy allocation to maturation depend on individual weight and body condition. However, \n\nthe lack of a correlation (in the case of males) or the inverse correlation (in the case of \n\nfemales) between total body weight (and digestive gland) and gonad weight (Louren\u00e7o et \n\nal., 2012), and between the nutritional profiles of the digestive gland and the mature gonad \n\n(Louren\u00e7o et al., 2014) show that both males and mature females channel energy directly \n\nfrom food to reproduction supporting the hypothesis that O. vulgaris is an income breeder \n\n(Houston et al., 2006; Quetglas et al., 2011) and whenever the environmental and feeding \n\nconditions are favourable (increasing body condition), the maturation process is triggered.  \n\nIndependently of maturity stage, the lipid content and fatty acids profile in the \n\ndigestive gland seems to offer a good indication of the nutritional condition of the \n\npopulation (Louren\u00e7o et al., 2014). The function of the digestive gland as a reservoir in \n\ncephalopods has been under discussion (Blanchier &amp; Boucaud-Camou, 1984; Garc\u00eda et al., \n\n2011; Garc\u00eda-Garrido et al., 2010; Moguel et al., 2010; Moltschaniwskyj &amp; Johnston, \n\n2006) for long, evidence suggesting that although cephalopods have a protein based \n\nmetabolism (Lee, 1995), polar lipids play an important role as constituents of the \n\nlipoproteins that form the cells membrane (Navarro et al., 2014) and the digestive gland \n\nplays an important role in lipid metabolism (Moguel et al., 2010; Moltschaniwskyj &amp; \n\nJohnston, 2006). Here, we showed that the FA profile found in the digestive gland of \n\nfemales of populations under different environmental conditions reflects the nutrients \n\navailable, mainly in the PUFA and MUFA profile but also in the n-3HUFA/n-6HUFA and \n\nDHA/EPA ratios (Louren\u00e7o et al., 2014). \n\nWith a short life cycle (one to two years) and absence of generation overlap, \n\npopulation resilience and the success of recruitment to fisheries are supported by the \n\nbiological and physical conditions that paralarvae and juveniless find prior to settlement, \n\nduring and immediately post settlement. The paralarval stage and the transition stage \n\n\n\n5. General Conclusions \n\n \n\n183 \n\n \n\nbetween paralarva and juvenile are the phases when most significant changes occur in \n\nmorphology, habitat and behaviour (including feeding behaviour) and also when higher \n\nrates of natural mortality occur (see Robin et al., 2014 for a review on the role of habitat, \n\nenvironment, functional morphology and behaviour in the transitions of the life history of \n\ncephalopods). It is therefore important to understand which of the environmental \n\nparameters (physical and nutritional) contribute to survival and recruitment success. Local \n\nfactors that most correlate with the higher abundances of O. vulgaris paralarvae in the \n\nspawning area of the R\u00eda de Vigo were investigated, showing that shallow waters protected \n\nfrom physical disturbance offer the best brooding grounds, as attested by the relatively \n\nhigher abundance of newly-hatched paralarvae.  \n\nThe nutritional conditions found by the paralarva are determinant to their survival \n\nand later recruitment success. The nutritional requirements of the paralarval stages in the \n\nwild and in captivity have been under discussion for several years and are perceived as the \n\nbottleneck factor preventing commercial scale aquaculture production of O. vulgaris \n\n(Iglesias et al., 2007; Seixas, 2009; Vaz-Pires et al., 2004). The identification of the \n\npreferential preys of O. vulgaris paralarvae in the R\u00eda de Vigo (Roura et al., 2012) open the \n\ndoor to a definition of the nutritional profile of the potential preys and O. vulgaris \n\nparalarval requirements in their natural conditions. Here, for the first time, it was possible \n\nto identify macro-nutrients and lipid classes including the fatty acid (FA) profile in newly \n\nhatched and recently-feeding O. vulgaris paralarvae and their natural preys, following the \n\nchanges in the FA trophic markers that occur between preys and paralarval predator. \n\nPotential prey (specific zooplankton communities) and O. vulgaris paralarval stages \n\npresent an identical Protein:Lipid ratio while small but significant differences in the ratios \n\nof n-3HUFA/n-6HUFA, DHA/ARA and DHA/EPA and in the ARA content. The results \n\nobtained here confirm the importance of maintaining the Protein:Lipid ratio between preys \n\nand paralarvae to guarantee the nutritional requirements of the latter, but at the same time \n\nmaintain high levels of n-3 HUFA that can be used by the paralarva to biosynthesize ARA, \n\nan essential component to growth. \n\nFew days after hatching in the R\u00eda de Vigo, the pelagic paralarvae disperse, first \n\nacross-shore and then along-shore by action of the coastal upwelling/downwelling \n\nmechanism (Moreno et al., 2009; Roura, 2013), and eventually (two to four months later) \n\nfind suitable grounds to settle and grow to maturation. Those grounds are located \n\npreferentially in the vicinity of estuaries or lagoons systems at short distances from the \n\n\n\n5. General Conclusions \n\n \n\n184 \n\n \n\ncoast line (10-15 km) at mean depths of approximately 80 m over grounds with a mixture \n\nof coarse sand and rocky outcrops that permit adequate sheltering in. Despite the short \n\ndistance between estuarine and lagoon systems where changes in salinity can occur more \n\nfrequently, we found that O. vulgaris juvenlies (sub-adults or pre-recruit) aggregations are \n\nparticularly vulnerable to changes in bottom salinity withstanding salinity variations \n\nranging between 35.60 and 36.30 (with a mean optimum salinity of 36.0) (Moreno et al., \n\n2014). Sea temperature does not play a similarly limiting role, and animals present in \n\nnorthwest and south grounds seem to present different optimal sea bottom and surface \n\ntemperatures (Moreno et al., 2014) as would be expected from the different reproductive \n\nstrategies followed on each coasts.  \n\nThe environmental characteristics of the southern pre-recruit grounds, and \n\nparticularly the R\u00eda Formosa ground are probably the most persistent in time and the most \n\nimportant to support the fisheries exploitation of the entire Portuguese coast and possibly \n\nthe neighbouring communities of the Gulf of C\u00e1diz. Considering the division in \n\noceanographic features between the seasonal upwelled northeast coast and the south coast, \n\nwhich Cape St. Vincent provides, and the coastal orientation shift from north-south to \n\nwest-east, it is believed that this region acts as barrier to biological exchanges between the \n\ntwo adjacent areas (Relvas et al., 2007; Pires et al., 2013). It is therefore most likely that \n\nthe spawning ground identified in the R\u00eda de Vigo and the nurseries found along the \n\nPortuguese northwestern coast do not support the south coast pre-recruitment grounds and \n\nthe latter is entirely supported by the nurseries identified in the south coast.   \n\nThe age structure of an exploited population is seen as a fundamental piece of \n\ninformation for the application of traditional assessment models, aiming to achieve the \n\nsustainable management of a fisheries resource. In the case of O. vulgaris, both the \n\napplication of traditional assessment models and the accurate estimation of age are not \n\ntrivial. Firstly, recruitment success does not depend on the previous spawning-stock \n\nbiomass (due to the absence of generation overlap) but on environmental conditions; and \n\nsecondly research on age and growth for a number of octopods  has shown an incredible \n\nvariability in size between individuals of the same attributed age (e.g. Leporati et al., 2008, \n\n2007). \n\nAccurate age and growth estimates will allow adding a time scale to stressful events \n\nin the life cycle of the animals which potentially increase pressure on the individual, \n\naffecting population survival and growth rates. Some known stress events can be related to \n\n\n\n5. General Conclusions \n\n \n\n185 \n\n \n\nhatching, settlement and spawning, but potentially others such as fishing patterns and \n\nvarying environmental conditions play crucial roles as well. How these influences the time \n\npopulation takes to attain a specified weight or how long the paralarvae from a specific \n\nseasonal hatchery remain in the pelagic realm or take to settle in pre-recruit grounds are \n\nimportant pieces of information to add to our modelling capabilities. The fact that stylets \n\nregister the life of an individual from the very first day, is an advantage of the use of this \n\nstructure to estimate age in relation to the use of beaks. Beaks have been used to estimate \n\nthe age of the O. vulgaris in the Mediterranean (Canali et al., 2011) and in the Sahara bank \n\n(Perales-Raya et al., 2010), but the estimation of absolute age using these structures is \n\ndifficult due to the erosion on the rostral region from feeding activity.  \n\nWe identified and measure the stylets in newly hatched paralarvae for the first time. \n\nThis study also allowed the identification of the hatch check in the stylets of adults on \n\nwhich the daily deposition of growth increments (GI) was already validated. Following the \n\nhatch check, juvenile stylets present a core region where the deposition of GI appears \n\nirregular or GI are less visible. The core region is limited at its end by the beginning of the \n\nregular deposition of GI. As no other check or marked transition in the GI deposition \n\npattern is identifiable in the stylets, we assume that this core region corresponds to the \n\nparalarval stage prior to settlement, but recognise that further studies are required in order \n\nto validate the correspondence between this core region and the paralarval phase.  \n\nUsing the stylets of pre-recruits and recruits of the Portuguese Northeast coast we \n\ninvestigated the level of precision that this ageing technique allows and made the first \n\ndirect determination of the approximate age of the individuals recruiting to the fishery in \n\nthis area, estimating that it takes approximately eleven months for the animals to attain the \n\nminimum landing weight of 750 g. \n\n \n\n5.1. FUTURE PERSPECTIVES \n\nThe growing interest and dependence of the Portuguese fisheries on the commom \n\noctopus as a guaranteed revenue source, associated to the new demands raised with the \n\nreform of the Common Fisheries Policy which commits Member-States to assess and \n\nmanage their most important fisheries, thus achieving sustainability by 2020 (EU \n\nRegulation 1380/2013) has sprouted new interest in research on the species. Additionally, \n\nthe national implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive with the \n\n\n\n5. General Conclusions \n\n \n\n186 \n\n \n\nobligation to achieve Good Environmental Status by 2020 and the use of indicators on \n\nbiodiversity, food web resilience and fisheries sustainability among others, is an additional \n\nchallenge to the management of the marine environment and the maintenance of fisheries \n\n\u201chealth\u201d. \n\nAchieving sustainable fisheries for O. vulgaris stocks or protecting its best habitat \n\nare small bricks in the greater framework that ensures GES. However, the characteristics of \n\nthe species and the level of its interactions with prey and predators, including a strongly \n\ndependent Portuguese fishing community afford it a particular importance. According to \n\nICES (2012b), the common octopus stock is identified as a category 4 stock for which only \n\nreliable catch data are available, implying that a precautionary approach should be \n\nfollowed in the advice to future exploitation rates. Due to its life cycle characteristics and \n\nrecruitment dependence of environmental conditions, the future of the stock assessment of \n\nthe species seems to follow the path of the integration of environmental effects in the \n\nassessment models. This work provided indications of what physical and biological factors \n\ncould have a predominant role in the survival and recruitment success and what \n\ncharacteristics identify the essential habitat of juveniles. The next step is to analyse the \n\nabundance time series (e.g. LPUE, CPUE and survey dedicated abundance estimates) \n\ncomparing those to environmental indicators (e.g. salinity, temperature, fresh water input) \n\naiming to identify cause-effect relationships and predict their impacts on stock availability \n\nto fisheries in the short-term (nine to twelve months predictions to couple with the lifespan \n\nof the species).  \n\nThe coupling of the species life cycle with local environmental conditions, its upper \n\npredator level in the trophic web and short life span place O. vulgaris (and potentially the \n\nother cephalopod species) in a good position to be considered a key functional group in the \n\ndefinition and monitoring of the marine environmental status in relation to biodiversity, \n\nfisheries and trophic web descriptors. Associating the biologic monitoring of parameters \n\nsuch as the age structure, growth rates and reproductive status of a population under a \n\nspecific environmental condition, with the application of environmental biomarkers, such \n\nas stable isotope signatures and FA trophic markers, is going to allow the  identification of \n\nspecific environmental conditions or status that  can be useful as tools to monitor \n\nenvironmental status and steer towards the GES aimed by the Marine Strategy Framework \n\nDirective.           \n\n\n\nLiterature cited  \n\n \n\n187 \n\n \n\nLITERATURE CITED\n7\n \n\nAR\u00cdSTEGUI, J., BARTON, E.D., \u00c1LVAREZ-SALGADO, X.A., SANTOS, A.M.P., FIGUEIRAS, F.G., \n\nKIFANI, S., HERN\u00c1NDEZ-LE\u00d3N, S., MASON, E., MACH\u00da, E. &amp; DEMARCQ, H. 2009.

Introduction\n\nThe common octopus Octopus vulgaris (Cuvier, 1797) is\nexploited as a target species by demersal trawl fleets and numer-\nous small-scale fisheries, using hand jigs, pots, traps and trammel\nnets operating in southern Europe and northwestern Africa (Hastie\net al., 2009). In 2010, the Portuguese landings of common octopus in\nnational ports were 12,602 tons (ten years average landings of 9050\ntons). The small-scale fleet, using traps and pots, is responsible for\n95% of the common octopus landings (ICES, 2011). Nevertheless,\na growing interest in this species as well as in other commercial\ncephalopod species is presently noticed for the bottom trawl fleet,\nwith 10% of the landings, in 2007 (Fonseca et al., 2008).\n\nCephalopods are characterized by a plastic life cycle with a rec-\nognized capacity to adapt to different ecosystems, due to a short life\nspan, high growth rate and diverse diets. O. vulgaris is a merobenthic\nincirrate octopod, common in temperate shallow habitats between\n\n? Corresponding author at: Unidade de Recursos Marinhos e Sustentabilidade,\nINRB I.

It is a simultaneous ter-\nminal spawner, laying on average 350,000 eggs in sheltered places\nbetween 20 and 120 m depth (Rocha et al., 2001; Silva et al., 2002).\nThe spawning season is generally extended throughout the year\nwith one or two  peaks geographically variable in timing (Hastie\net al., 2009).\n\nThe Portuguese coast is a highly dynamic oceanographic region\nin the temperate northeast Atlantic, influenced by two impor-\ntant oceanographic systems the Western Iberia Upwelling System\n(WIUS) and the Gulf of Cadiz System (GCS). The WIUS is character-\nized by a strong influence of the spring-summer coastal upwelling\n(Fi\u00faza, 1983; Mason et al., 2005). The predominantly equatorward\nwinds observed in summer, drive an offshore Ekman transport\nand force the upwelling of colder, nutrient-rich, subsurface waters\nalong the coast (Relvas et al., 2007). The presence of the poleward\ncurrent, responsible for the formation of convergence zones over\n\n0165-7836/$ \u2013 see front matter \u00a9  2012 Elsevier B.V.

All year round the coastal sea water tem-\nperature ranges between 14.4 ?C and 19.6 ?C (Moreno et al., 2009a)\nwith a shallow thermocline developing during spring (Cunha,\n2001). The south Portuguese coast on the other hand, is influenced\nby the GCS. The south coast orientation does not favor upwelling\nunder northerly winds. Upwelling and downwelling events tend to\nbe weak and the circulation is mainly wind forced and influenced\nby the local orography (Garc\u00eda-Lafuente and Ruiz, 2007). The Cape\nSta Maria (36? 57?N, 7? 53?W)  divides the continental shelf in two,\nsupporting different oceanographic processes (Garc\u00eda-Lafuente and\nRuiz, 2007). East to the Cape Sta Maria, the presence of the Huelva\nfront as a warm coastal current flowing along the shore, the signifi-\ncant fresh water runoff forming buoyant river plumes in spring, the\noccasional occurrence of the Stafford Shear, a cold\u2013warm frontal\nregion associated to local upwelling systems (Mason et al., 2005)\nand an extended Sea Surface Temperature (SST) range, between\nthe 15.4 ?C and the 21.9 ?C (Moreno et al., 2009b)  are the main\ncharacteristics of the GCS.\n\nStudies on the reproductive features of commercially exploited\nmarine species such as the common octopus are an important\ntool for the assessment of the stock status. Detailed informa-\ntion about the timing and the sites of spawning, size at maturity,\nand sex ratio at breeding, require a consistent assessment of the\nstate of sexual maturity. These assessments usually involve sev-\neral aspects of the reproductive development, such as the state\nof the gonad and the accessory reproductive structures, and are\nbased on descriptive maturity scales and/or maturity condition\nindices (Boyle and Rodhouse, 2006). Due to the extensive distribu-\ntion area of O. vulgaris and the commercial interest of the species in\nthe Atlantic waters of the Iberian Peninsula, several studies have\nbeen conducted on the reproductive features of geographically\ndistinct sub-populations. Based in her experiments in captivity\nMangold (1983) reviewed all aspects of the O. vulgaris life cycle,\nand more recently other two reviews addressing O. vulgaris were\npublished (Hastie et al., 2009 and Pierce et al., 2010), compiling\nrecent advances on fisheries and life cycle aspects.\n\nRegarding specifically O. vulgaris reproductive aspects, several\npapers targeting Mediterranean, Iberian and other regional sub-\npopulations have been published since the late 70s, with diversified\nsampling designs and methodology used to identify spawning sea-\nson mainly based on proportions of mature individuals and several\ncondition indices, such as Gonad-Somatic index (GSI) or Hayashi\nindex (HI). Such studies rely mostly on landings from trawl fleets\n(e.g. Quetglas et al., 1998) and small-scale fleets (e.g. S\u00e1nchez and\nObarti, 1993; Hern\u00e1ndez-Garc\u00eda et al., 2002; Fern\u00e1ndez-Rueda and\nGarc\u00eda-Fl\u00f3rez, 2007). A few studies were conducted with sam-\npling designed specifically to O. vulgaris (e.g. Smith and Griffiths,\n2002; Oosthuizen and Smale, 2003; Rodr\u00edguez-Rua et al., 2005;\nKatsanevakis and Verripoulos, 2006).\n\nConsidering its regional proximity and the methodology used,\nthe studies of Silva et al. (2002) and Otero et al. (2007) are par-\nticularly relevant for the present study. In the Northwest Galician\nwaters, Otero et al. (2007) define a single spawning season during\nspring (May\u2013June) related with the seasonal coastal upwelling in\nGalician waters, despite the presence of mature females all year\nround. In those waters, males mature at smaller sizes than females\nand the mass transfer during the maturation process occurs directly\nfrom feeding sources. According to Silva et al.  (2002),  in waters\nof the Gulf of Cadiz, the reproductive season covers most of the\nyear, with two distinct peaks in April/May and August/September.\nAs in the previous study, males mature at smaller sizes than\nfemales.\n\nThe present study aims to identify different reproductive strate-\ngies adopted by different populations, considering the distinct\noceanographic features of the northwest coast within the WIUS\nand the South coast within the GCS. The reproductive strategies\nidentified are described in terms of sex ratio, proportion of mature\nindividuals and monthly mean Gonad-Somatic and Hayashi indices.\nAt the individual level, length\u2013weight relationships are determined\nby sex and area, as well as maturity ogives and the size effect at\nmaturity. Additionally the effect of size and body condition is ana-\nlyzed for each sex in both regions in order to identify sexual and\nregional differences regarding the use of storage mass for repro-\nduction.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Sampling\n\nSamples were collected monthly from January 2007 to\nNovember 2010 from the small-scale trap fishery (Table 1) and\nfrozen. Sampling sites were chosen considering the two different\noceanographic regions, the Northwest coast, with Peniche as the\nlanding port, and the South coast with Olh\u00e3o as the landing port\n(Fig. 1). For all individuals, the dorsal mantle length (ML in mm),\nindividual weight (W in g) and digestive gland weight (DGW in\ng) were measured to the nearest 5 mm  and 0.1 g, respectively. To\nassess maturation, the following data were collected: testis and\novary weight (TW and OW), Needham\u2019s complex weight (NCW),\noviduct weight (ODW) and oviducal complex weight (OCW), all\nweighed to the nearest 0.01 g. A maturity scale of four stages for\nmales (I: immature; II: maturing; III: mature; IV: post-spawning)\nand five stages for females (I: immature; II: maturing; III: pre-\nspawning; IV: mature; V: post-spawning) was used (adapted from\nGuerra, 1975).\n\n2.2. Data analysis\n\n2.2.1. Sex ratio and spawning season\nIndividual weight data aggregated in 200 g weight classes by\n\nstudy area were analyzed using RMIX, an algorithm designed to\nidentify and separate normal distributions in size frequency dis-\ntributions (Macdonald and Green, 1988; Macdonald, 2010). RMIX\nidentifies a set of overlapping component distributions that give\nthe best fit to the histogram. The modal weight classes, identified\nby visual inspection of the weight distribution, were used as the\ninitial weight parameters. Constraints were applied in the analy-\nsis, such as a fixed variance coefficient for each component. Only\ncomponents with n > 50 were considered and all components were\nassumed to be lognormal.\n\nThe sex ratio by month was  estimated as the ratio between\nmales and females. Significant deviations from 1:1 were tested by\na ?2 test with  ? = 0.05. In order to define the spawning season by\nstudy area, the proportion of mature individuals (MI) was deter-\nmined monthly as: MIfi = (?Mi/Ni)f, with i as month, and M as the\nfrequency of mature females, f (maturity stage III and IV) in each\nmonth; MImi = (?Mi/Ni)m, with i as month, and M as the frequency\nof mature males, m (maturity stage III) in each month. The spawning\nseason was  defined empirically as the sampling months in which\nMIfi > 0.1 and MImi > 0.1.\n\nBoth the Gonad Somatic index (GSI) and the Hayashi index (HI)\nare important tools to assess the reproductive and maturation con-\ndition both at the individual and population level. The GSI, most\nindicated to assess the maturation condition in females (Guerra,\n1975), was determined individually for all females in the form\nGSI = OW \u00d7 100/(BW ? OW)  (Otero et al., 2007). The monthly GSI\nwas  determined as the monthly mean of the individual GSI and\n\n\n\nAuthor's personal copy\n\n118 S.

The HI, most indicated to\nassess the maturation condition in males (Guerra, 1975) was deter-\nmined individually for all males in the form HI = NCW/(NCW + TW)\n(Otero et al., 2007). The monthly HI was determined as the monthly\nmean of the individual HIm and analyzed separately for each study\narea. The standard error was adopted as the measure of variabil-\nity for the determination of the monthly mean of GSI and HI, and\ndetermined as SE =\n\n?\n(Var(GSIi)/ni) or SE =\n\n?\n(Var(HIi)/ni) with i as\n\nmonth (Zar, 1999).\n\n2.2.2. Length\u2013weight relationship and weight-at-maturity\nThe effect of both study area and sex in the length\u2013weight rela-\n\ntionship and maturity proportion was investigated with Scheff\u00e9\nF-tests at a significance level  ? = 0.05. In order to normalize the\ndata, ML,  W and MI  by 200 g weight class were log transformed\nand compared with a two-way ANOVA test at a significance level\n\n ? = 0.05.\nLength\u2013weight relationships for combined sexes as well as\n\nfor all females and all males were determined by means of\nnon-linear estimates by maximum likelihood of the form log\n\n(W) = a + b \u00d7 log(ML). Goodness of fit was expressed by r2 and the\nsignificance level of the parameters estimated by Student\u2019s t-test.\n\nA maturity curve, for each sex in each study area, was  fit-\nted to the weight frequency distribution of the proportion (Pi) of\nmature individuals by 200 g weight class, with a logistic model:\nPi = 1/(1 + exp(  ? + ?Wi) by weight class, i. Differences in the matu-\nrity curves between areas and between sexes were tested by\nmeans of the non-parametric Kruskal\u2013Wallis test for successive\ncomparisons. The weight-at-maturity was  defined as the weight\nclass where 50% of individuals are mature and determined from\nW50% = ??/?.\n\n2.2.3. Body condition and energy allocation\nThe body condition was  determined for each study area for\n\nfemales and males separately, as the value of the residuals\nobtained from the geometric mean regression of log(BW) by\nlog(BW) ? log(OW) for the females, replacing log(OW) by log(TW)\nfor the males. The residuals resulting from this analysis allow a\ncomparison of individuals independently of body weight: positive\nresiduals indicate animals that are heavier than predicted by the\n\n\n\nAuthor's personal copy\n\nS.

Sampling ports and coastal characteristics.\n\nmodel, and negative residuals indicate individuals that weight less\nthan predicted. Variations in body condition were compared by\nmaturity stage using a one-way ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s honesty sig-\nnificant difference HSD post hoc test (McGrath Steer and Jackson,\n2004; Zar, 1999).\n\nTo study the relative energy allocation, the variation in weight\nbetween organs in mature animals was assessed. Two  geomet-\nric regressions were performed on mature individuals of each\nstudy area, for each sex separately: (A) the body weight vs. gonad\nweight and (B) the body weight vs. digestive gland weight, after log\ntransformation. The residuals obtained from these two regressions,\nprovide a size-independent estimate of the relative weight of the\ngonads and digestive gland. To determine if there is a mass trans-\nfer between organs during the reproductive process, the residuals\nderived from both regressions were compared to the body weight\n(W), the reproductive complex weight (OW + OCW for females and\nTW + NCW for males) and the digestive gland weight using the\nPearson correlation test procedure (Zar, 1999).\n\n3. Results\n\nThe weight of females ranged between 625 g (135 mm ML,\nmaturity stage II, northwest coast) and 6189 g (247 mm  ML,\nmaturity stage IV, south coast). The weight of males ranged\nbetween 635 g (100 mm ML,  maturity stage II, south coast)\nand 5612 g (248 mm ML,  maturity stage III, south coast). The\nweight distributions were significantly different between areas\n(?2Kruskal\u2013Wallis = 19.62, df = 6, p &lt;0.05) and within each area\nbetween sexes (Northwest coast, ?2Kruskal\u2013Wallis = 28.55, df = 6,\np &lt;0.05; South coast, ?2Kruskal\u2013Wallis = 42.07, df = 6, p &lt;0.05) (Fig. 2).\nWeight frequency analysis indicates that the weight distribution\nwas bimodal in both areas. On the Northwest coast the weight\ndistribution presents two modal peaks in the 1100 g weight class\n(modal weight, 1147 g) and in the 2200 g weight class (modal\nweight, 2216 g). On the South coast the weight distribution presents\na mode in the 900 g weight class (modal weight of 979 g) and\nanother in the 1700 g weight class (modal weight of 1724 g)\n(Table 2).\n\n3.1. Sex ratio and spawning season\n\nThe overall sex ratio (F:M) showed that in the Northwest\ncoast sample, males are significantly more abundant than females,\n0.88:1. In these samples, more males occurred in all months with\nthe exception of April, October and November when the sex ratio\nwas  balanced towards females. On the other hand, despite the\nfact that the overall sex ratio on the South coast was 1:1, females\nwere more abundant than males except for the months of August,\nOctober, November and December, where the sex ratio was bal-\nanced towards males (Table 3).\n\nTable 4 presents the proportion of mature individuals found\nby month in both sampling sites. In the Northwest coast, mature\nmales were present every month with the exception of November\n2007. For females, it is possible to identify a consistent pattern of a\nhigher proportion of mature individuals (proportion mature > 0.10)\nbetween early spring and late summer. In the south coast, no\nmature males were found in the samples in September 2008\nand October 2008, between March 2009 and May  2009, and in\nSeptember 2010 and November 2010. In this region, there was  a\nnon-negligible presence of mature females in late winter and ear-\nlier spring months of 2007, 2008 and 2010, although the major\nproportion of mature females occurs in a single month in summer\nor late summer in each year.\n\nConsidering the overall results, females in maturity stage I\npresent a mean GSI of 0.198 (\u00b10.004, SE), in stage II of 0.507\n(\u00b10.022), in stage III of 3.947 (\u00b10.215), and for fully mature females\n(stage IV) of 9.134 (\u00b10.566), revealing a clear separation between\nmaturing females and pre-spawning females. In males, the HI\nmaturity index also presents increasing values from immature to\nmature males, with HI values of 0.357 (\u00b10.004) for stage II males,\nand 0.429 (\u00b10.005) for stage III males, although in this case with\noverlapping extremes. For both maturity stages I and IV, not enough\ndata were available for the determination of HI by maturity stage\n(n = 2 for maturity stage I, and n = 1 for maturity stage IV).\n\nIn the northwest coast (Fig. 3) females present higher GSI\nbetween early spring and summer, with two  GSI peaks, during the\nstudied period. After the second GSI peak, values decrease to near\n0.1, comparable to the mean GSI for stage I. Regarding males in the\nnorthwest coast, HI present higher values roughly between late\nwinter and late summer, comparable to those of stage III males.\n\nIn the south coast (Fig. 4), the plot of mean monthly GSI for\nfemales shows that there is a spawning peak in the summer or late\nsummer months, although in adjacent months values are always\nhigh and near the average for mature animals, indicating the occur-\nrence of mature females throughout the year. A secondary peak\noccurs in some spring months as is evident in March 2008 and June\nto July 2009. As for the HI of males, no specific season stands out\nfor a higher proportion of mature specimens, although peaks are\nfound in January 2007, from March 2008 to July 2008, and from\nApril 2009 to March 2010, indicating that mature males are present\nindependently of the season.\n\n3.2. Length\u2013weight relationship and weight-at-maturity\n\nLength\u2013weight relationship parameters by area and by sex\nas well as the statistical tests to the parameters estimated are\nsummarized in Table 5. The ANCOVA analysis of the influence of\ngeographic location and sex in length\u2013weight relationships shows\nthat the combined effect of both factors is significant (area: sex,\nF = 11.83, p-value &lt;0.05), with the effect of the single factor area\nalso being significant (F = 46.93, p-value &lt;0.05) but not the effect of\nthe single factor sex (F = 2.47, p-value > 0.05), resulting in different\nlength\u2013weight relationships in each area, and for males and females\nin the northwest coast. In every case the increase in weight with\nlength may  be characterized as positively allometric (b > 1).\n\n\n\nAuthor's personal copy\n\n120 S.

In the case of males, no significant correlation\nwas found between the size-independent digestive gland weight\nand total weight or reproductive complex weight. Energy alloca-\ntion shown by the size-independent gonad weight evidences a\nnegative correlation with total weight for both females (?0.428,\ndf = 261, p &lt;0.05) and males (?0.256, df = 492, p &lt;0.05), and sim-\nilarly with the digestive gland weight (females: ?0.256, df = 261,\np &lt;0.05; males: ?0.412, df = 492, p &lt;0.05).\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThe definition of different spawning seasons in octopus pop-\nulations within relatively short distances off the Portuguese coast\nconfirms the plasticity of environmental responses of the O. vulgaris\n\nlife cycle, as observed in other cephalopods such as Loligo forbesi and\nLoligo vulgaris (Boyle et al., 1995; Moreno et al., 2005). In the north-\nwest coast, females mature preferentially between early spring and\nsummer in a long spawning season that encompasses two spawn-\ning peaks, one in February\u2013April and another in June\u2013July. In this\nregion, mature males are found all year round and are generally\nmore abundant in the fishery than females, due to the spawn-\ning behavior of the latter, which decreases their availability at\nspawning. In autumn, the proportion of immature females in the\npopulation increases with a decrease of mature individuals, both\nmales and females.\n\nIn the south coast, the reproductive season occurs during sum-\nmer  peaking in September, despite the non-negligible occurrence\nof mature females during late winter or early spring, which would\nindicate that more favorable conditions could generate a secondary\npeak. Similar situations have been described for other popula-\ntions in oligotrophic conditions as in the eastern Mediterranean\nwaters and south-eastern coast of South Africa (S\u00e1nchez and Obarti,\n1993; Oosthuizen and Smale, 2003; Katsanevakis and Verripoulos,\n2006). Here, the overall sex ratio is balanced towards males, which\nseems particularly common in commercially exploited O. vulgaris\npopulations (Hern\u00e1ndez-Garc\u00eda et al., 2002; Fern\u00e1ndez-Rueda and\nGarc\u00eda-Fl\u00f3rez, 2007; Otero et al., 2007). This variation in sex ratio,\nother than purely derived from the behavioral unavailability of\nfemales to commercial fisheries, has also been explained by a\ncombination of different factors, such as different growth rates,\nmigrations, feeding or post-spawning behavior (Mangold, 1983)\nalthough we  have not found any study that indisputably proves the\nexistence of ontogenic or reproductive migrations in populations\nof the common octopus.\n\nOur results seem to indicate that it is mainly the females that\ndisplay environmentally adaptive reproductive strategies. In the\n\nFig. 6. Mean body condition (\u00b1SE) with maturity stages.\n\n\n\nAuthor's personal copy\n\nS. Lourenc? o et al. / Fisheries Research 127\u2013 128 (2012) 116\u2013 124 123\n\nNorthwest coast where the ocean is more dynamic, the spawn-\ning season is extended over more than 6 months usually with two\nreproductive peaks similarly to the results of Hern\u00e1ndez-Garc\u00eda\net al. (2002) and Fern\u00e1ndez-Rueda and Garc\u00eda-Fl\u00f3rez (2007) and\nOtero et al. (2007).  In this area, the reproductive cycle of O. vulgaris,\ntherefore appears to be highly connected with the long upwelling\nseason as in other regions, such as the adjacent Galician waters\nand the Sahara Bank (Hatanaka, 1979; Demarcq and Faure, 2000;\nOtero et al., 2007), synchronizing hatching with ideal conditions\nfor food supply (Otero et al., 2008; Moreno et al., 2009a)  combined\nwith reduced exchanges with offshore areas (Demarcq and Faure,\n2000). Ecologically, the WIUS is characterized by a persistent nutri-\nent and zooplankton shoreward transport (Almeida and Queiroga,\n2003; Santos et al., 2004; Queiroga et al., 2007), favored by the\nwesterly winds in late winter and spring, that create a continu-\nous supply of food and potentiate the survival of two  cohorts of\nparalarvae, hatching approximately four months apart, in July and\nNovember (Mangold and Boletzky, 1987; Otero et al., 2008; Moreno\net al., 2009b).\n\nIn the South coast, where conditions are more stable but less\nproductive, females concentrate spawning over a shorter period of\ntime. The factors that trigger the onset of the reproduction seem to\nbe related with the seasonal occurrence of favorable oceanographic\nconditions, such as higher temperatures and salinities, favored by\nthe easterly winds which are common during summer in the coastal\nareas close to Cape Sta Maria (S\u00e1nchez and Relvas, 2003; Garc\u00eda-\nLafuente et al., 2006). Ecologically, the GCS is a less dynamic and\noligotrophic system, in which species tend to direct all of their\nenergy onto a single spawning peak, such as in the case of the sar-\ndine Sardina pilchardus,  the anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and the\nwedge sole Dicologlossa cuneata (Bald\u00f3 et al., 2006). In the case of\nthe common octopus, individuals spawn in late summer, with the\nnext generation hatching in winter, when the predominant west-\nerly winds favor the transport of nutrients and zooplankton near\nto the Cape Sta Maria (Garc\u00eda-Lafuente and Ruiz, 2007).\n\nActually, these differences of timing and spawning strategies\nadopted by neighboring O. vulgaris populations is also observed\non the South African coast, where the southwest coast is bathed\nby the cold-water northward flowing Benguela Current producing\nlong and strong upwelling events, and the southeastern coast is\ninfluenced by the Agulhas Current, a western boundary current that\ntransports warm equatorial water pole wards (Gibbons et al., 2010).\nOn the west coast, O. vulgaris females spawn throughout the year\nbut mainly between spring and summer (Smith and Griffiths, 2002),\nand in the southeast coast, females spawn in summer, in a shorter\nand more intense spawning season (Oosthuizen and Smale, 2003).\n\nThe length\u2013weight relationship in the present study varies not\nonly with sex but also with region, apparently reflecting envi-\nronmental conditions. For the northwest region we determined\ndifferent length\u2013weight relationships for females and males, both\npositively allometric, but showing that males increase in weight\nfaster than females (bmales > bfemales). In the south coast, no differ-\nences were found in the length\u2013weight relationship between sexes\nand both present lower increases in weight with length than either\nsex in the northwest coast.\n\nIt is particularly interesting to note that in this study, geographic\narea is not reflected in maturity ogives, which may  suggest that\nbiological constraints could be imposing limits to minimum mat-\nuration body size, as occurs in other cephalopod species (see e.g.\nBoavida-Portugal et al., 2010; Moreno et al., 2005). The weight-at-\nmaturity for females is 2550 g and 1577 g for males. The differences\nfound between sexes are probably linked with the simultaneous\nterminal spawning strategy, with females having to store reserves\nthat are then mobilized to produce yolk, and for behavioral traits\nrelated to egg laying and protection. Additionally males proba-\nbly reach maturity earlier in the life cycle, followed by an earlier\n\ndecrease in growth rate (Mangold, 1983; Smith et al., 2005). How-\never, weight-at-maturity registered for both sexes in our samples\nis higher than previously published for adjacent waters. In the\nnortherly neighboring waters of Galicia, females mature at 1788.3 g\nand males at 903.4 g (Otero et al., 2007), and in the southeastern\nneighboring waters of the Gulf of Cadiz females mature at 2023 g\nand males at 671 g (Silva et al., 2002). The differences found in\nthe weight-at-maturity in different regions may  be related with\nthe sampling strategy followed by each author, since weight-at-\nmaturity decreases at peak population maturity (Moreno, 2008)\nand thus the proportion of samples taken from peak reproduction\nseasons in relation to those obtained throughout the year affects the\nsize-composition of the sample of mature females. It can also indi-\nrectly result from the gears with which the samples were collected,\nsince some gears are less likely to collect fully mature females\n(Fern\u00e1ndez-Rueda and Garc\u00eda-Fl\u00f3rez, 2007). It is therefore likely\nthat there is high variability between individuals in any popula-\ntion and that sample characteristics, among which size and timing,\nmay  strongly influence the results. It seems reasonable to assume,\nand has been demonstrated, that maturity is first of all driven by a\nminimum weight limit and subsequently modulated by biological\nand environmental conditions. In our samples, there is a significant\nincrease in body condition for both females and males between\nstage II (immature) and stage III (pre-spawning), indicating that\nthe relative success of somatic growth in this pre-spawning stage\nmay  be crucial to determine subsequent events (McGrath Steer and\nJackson, 2004; Otero et al., 2007).\n\nMass allocation data show that reserves are heading for repro-\nduction in both sexes, although some differences can be found\nbetween males and females, in accordance with the studies con-\nducted by Otero et al. (2007) and Rosa et al. (2004),  and similarly to\nLoligo forbesi (Collins et al., 1995; Smith et al., 2005). Considering\nthat males mature at smaller sizes than females, and can maintain\nthis stage for several months until a female is available to breed,\nthere seems to be a differentiated breeding strategy between males\nand females. Other studies, such as Gonc? alves et al. (2002) and\nRodr\u00edguez-Rua et al. (2005),  additionally suggest that mature males\nare able to breed with immature females which receive and store\nthe mature spermatophores inside the oviducal glands until the\noocytes mature. However, only the mass transfer between organs\nwas  considered here, and this should be complemented by a study\nof the types of energetic nutrients that are transferred between\norgans.\n\nThe present study has shown the potential influence and rel-\native importance of environmental factors on the reproduction\ncycle of O. vulgaris, modulating timing, intensity and synchronism.\nOther studies have been constantly disclosing interactions that may\nimprove our understanding of the main mechanisms. Neverthe-\nless, in terms of population segregation, it seems evident that even\nunder conditions of apparent genetic homogeneity (Cabranes et al.,\n2008), populations subjected to fisheries in different geographic\nareas must be managed differently. And if we agree on the extent\nof its distribution pattern, O. vulgaris is one of the most diversely\nimpacted cephalopods in terms of environmental exposure.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors wish to express their acknowledgment to Pedro\nMendonc? a for assistance with the biological sampling.

Trophic habitat and gonad quality of\n\nneighbouring populations off the Portuguese coast,\n\nsubject to different oceanographic regimes, were\n\ncompared using the digestive gland and beaks as\n\nrecorders of trophic and habitat preferences, and\n\ngonads as indicators of egg quality. Cholesterol,\n\nphospholipids and triacylglycerol content, essential\n\nfatty acid (EFA) profile of the digestive gland and\n\nstable isotopes, d15N and d13C, in the buccal mass\nflesh and beaks were indicators of the differences in\n\nthe trophic habitat between populations. For gonad\n\nquality, the same bio-indicators were used to identify\n\ndifferences with maturation. The study shows that,\n\nalthough diet influences the EFA profile of the gonads\n\nto a certain degree, the main lipid content, phospho-\n\nlipids and cholesterol content in the gonads are not\n\ninfluenced by habitat conditions. This, therefore,\n\nsuggests that O. vulgaris is able to influence the\n\nquality of egg content independent of diet. The species\n\nis believed to be an income breeder which attains\n\nmaturity upon reaching a sufficient condition level,\n\nthen channelling energy directly from food to gonad\n\ndevelopment.\n\nKeywords Octopus vulgaris ?Trophic habitat ?\nGonad quality ?

The habitat biodiver-\n\nsity and energy flow to which the populations are\n\nexposed are mirrored in the molecular and energetic\n\ncomposition of the tissues (Rosa et al., 2004a;\n\nBandarra et al., 2006; Cherel et al., 2009; Garc??a-\n\nGarrido et al., 2010).\n\nThe diet of O. vulgaris depends on the life-cycle\n\nstage, size, depth of occurrence, habitat and seasonal\n\navailability of their prey (Nixon, 1985; Smith, 2003).\n\nThe cephalopod hepatopancreas or digestive gland has\n\ndifferent functions in the physiology of Octopus spp.,\n\nincluding the synthesis and secretion of digestive\n\nenzymes, the reabsorption and metabolism of nutri-\n\nents; synthesis and storage of lipids like cholesterol,\n\nlipoproteins, glycogen, pigments, vitamins and pro-\n\ntein-bound Fe, Cu, Ca and non-physiological heavy\n\nmetals; and excretion and rejection of waste products\n\nof the digestion and cell metabolism (Blanchier &amp;\n\nBoucaud-Camou, 1984; Budelmann et al., 1997;\n\nMoltschaniwskyj &amp; Johnston, 2006). Its function as\n\na storage organ indicates its utility as the ideal source\n\nof dietary tracers such as essential fatty acids (EFA)\n\n(Phillips et al., 2001) and dietary lipids (e.g., triacyl-\n\nglycerol and cholesterol) that are deposited in this\n\norgan with little or no modification of the lipid content\n\n(Boucaud-Camou &amp; Boucher-Rodoni, 1983; Phillips\n\net al., 2003).\n\nLipids are important dietary constituents, providing\n\nenergy, vitamins and EFA. Cholesterol is the pre-\n\ndominant sterol in the cephalopod\u2019s lipid reserves\n\n(Sieiro et al., 2006) and proxy of the production of\n\nhormones in marine invertebrates (Kanazawa, 2002).\n\nThe endogenous synthesis of cholesterol seems to be\n\nabsent in cephalopods, suggesting that it is an\n\nessential dietary nutrient (Villanueva &amp; Norman,\n\n2008). Triacylglycerol is a neutral lipid involved in\n\nfatty acid (FA) storage and metabolism (Lee et al.,\n\n2006). The FAs incorporated within the phospholipids\n\nact as building blocks for the membrane lipid bilayer\n\n(Dalsgaard et al., 2003; Berge? &amp; Barnathan, 2005;\n\nAthenstaedt &amp; Daum, 2006). The seasonal variability\n\nof triacylglycerols and phospholipids is related with\n\ncellular mechanisms under different environmental\n\nconditions and because of that, they are good indica-\n\ntors of the condition (Shulman &amp; Love, 2006). The\n\nmost important EFA are arachidonic acid C20:4n6\n\n(ARA), eicosapentaenoic acid C20:5n3 (EPA) and\n\ndocosahexaenoic acid C22:6n3 (DHA). The require-\n\nments on ARA, EPA and DHA and the balance\n\nbetween them are important for growth (Navarro &amp;\n\nVillanueva, 2000; Shulman &amp; Love, 2006). These\n\nEFA are related with the energy channelling, the\n\ncellular membrane structure and function, and are\n\nintegral elements of phospholipids as components of\n\nlipid bilayers (Tocher, 2010).\n\nReproduction timing in O. vulgaris depends on the\n\nlocal oceanographic regime: a long season in produc-\n\ntive systems, frequently with two reproductive peaks;\n\nand a shorter season (1\u20132 months) in oligotrophic\n\nsystems (Lourenc?o et al., 2012). The formation of the\n\nyolk is extremely important during maturation and egg\n\ndevelopment, because the newly hatched paralarvae\n\nare not truly lecithotrophic depending to some extent\n\non these reserves to survive (Boletzky, 1975; Villanu-\n\neva &amp; Norman, 2008). The nutritional content of the\n\nyolk is mainly protein, but lipids are also important for\n\nmembrane formation and energetic supply (11\u201314% of\n\ndry weight) particularly that of polyunsaturated fatty\n\nacids (PUFA), phospholipids and cholesterol (Navarro\n\n&amp; Villanueva, 2000).\n\nThe d13C and d15N signatures in different tissues of\na predator like O. vulgaris reflect its habitat and\n\ntrophic position, respectively (Cherel &amp; Hobson,\n\n2005). Consumers or predators are enriched in\n15\n\nN\n\nrelative to their food and consequently the d15N\nmeasurement is an indicator of the consumer trophic\n\nposition (Vander Zanden &amp; Rasmussen, 2001; Hobson\n\n&amp; Cherel, 2006). With little variation along the food\n\nchain, the d13C is used to determine primary sources in\nthe trophic web indicating the habitat of the organism,\n\nand the inshore versus offshore, or pelagic versus\n\nbenthic contribution of food intake (Cherel &amp; Hobson,\n\n2007; Jackson et al., 2007). The determination of\n\nstable isotope d13C and d15N signatures both in muscle\nand in cephalopod beaks are complementary\n\napproaches to stomach content and fatty acid analysis\n\nin studies of trophic dynamics and feeding ecology,\n\nallowing the identification of ontogenic migration and\n\nfeeding shift events (Stowasser, 2004; Jackson et al.,\n\n2007). In species like O. vulgaris, diet studies are\n\ndifficult to carry out due to the diversity of preys\n\n(Smith, 2003); the fast digestion rate (Boucaud-\n\nCamou &amp; Boucher-Rodoni, 1983); and the large\n\nnumber of empty stomachs. For these cases, an\n\nanalytic approach combining fatty acids and stable\n\nHydrobiologia\n\n123\n\n\n\nisotopes analyses provides overall information on the\n\naverage diet regarding both trophic level and habitat of\n\na particular population.\n\nHere we hypothesise that environmental condi-\n\ntions, including the trophic habitat, influence the\n\nbiochemical composition of storage organs and the\n\nnutritional quality of the eggs (indirectly potentially\n\naffecting the next generation). The Portuguese coast\n\npresents an advantageous geographical setting where\n\nit is possible to follow O. vulgaris populations which\n\nare subjected to distinct environmental conditions: in\n\nthe northwest coast, one of the populations is in a\n\nproductive system integrated in the Western Iberia\n\nUpwelling System (Relvas et al., 2007); in the south,\n\nthe other is integrated in the Gulf of Cadiz System\n\ninfluenced by the oligotrophic and warmer waters of\n\nthe Huelva front where downwelling and upwelling\n\nevents are weaker and not seasonal (Garc??a-Lafuente\n\net al., 2006). To test our hypothesis, we followed the\n\nEFA profile and the content of total lipids, cholesterol,\n\ntriacylglycerol and phospholipids as bio-indicators of\n\nvariations in the digestive gland and in immature and\n\nfully developed gonads of females of both popula-\n\ntions. We also followed the stable isotope d13C and\nd15N signatures in the upper and lower beaks and\nbuccal mass tissue of immature and mature individuals\n\nto identify the possible differences in the overall diet\n\nbetween population and maturity stages.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nSampling\n\nAll tissue samples were obtained from females\n\ncaptured in the small-scale O. vulgaris fisheries from\n\nMarch to April 2011 within the two study areas\n\nrepresented by landings in ports of Peniche (northwest\n\ncoast area; lat: 39?21.40 N, long: 9?20.38 W) and\nOlha?o (south coast area; lat: 36?59.34 N, long:\n7?50.44 W). Within each area, five immature females\nand five mature females were selected and digestive\n\ngland tissue and gonads were collected, freeze-dried\n\nand stored at -20?C.\nCleaned upper and lower beaks and buccal mass\n\nmuscular tissue (referred as flesh hereafter) samples\n\nwere collected from frozen animals and kept in 70%\n\nethanol for isotopic analysis. Sampling was conducted\n\nconsidering the same explanatory factors, area and\n\nmaturity in an unbalanced sampling design, collecting\n\n27 flesh samples (4 mature and 6 immature samples in\n\nthe northwest coast and 5 mature and 12 immature\n\nsamples in the south coast) and 33 beak samples\n\n(8 mature and 9 immature in the northwest coast and 5\n\nmature and 12 immature in the south coast). The dorsal\n\nmantle length and individual weight were measured to\n\nthe nearest 5 mm and 0.1 g, respectively. Immature\n\nand maturing females were classified as immature\n\nwhereas mature and spawning females were classified\n\nas mature (according to Guerra, 1975).\n\nStable isotope analyses\n\nBeaks and flesh samples were freeze-dried and\n\nhomogenized prior to analysis. To avoid the depletion\n\nof d13C values due to the presence of lipids, flesh\nsamples were rinsed successively in a 2:1 chloroform\u2013\n\nmethanol solution (Cherel et al., 2005). Nitrogen and\n\ncarbon isotope ratios were determined via Finningan\n\nconflo II interface to a Thermo Delta V S mass\n\nspectrometer coupled to a Flash EA1112 Series\n\nelemental analyser. Approximately 0.3 mg of each\n\nsample was combusted in a tin cup for the simulta-\n\nneous determination of nitrogen and carbon isotope\n\nratios. Isotope ratios are presented in the usual d\nnotation relative to the PeeDee Belemnite (PDB) for\n\ncarbon and atmospheric N2 (AIR) for nitrogen, and\n\nexpressed as %. Replicate measurements of internal\nlaboratory standards (acetanilide) indicate a precision\n\nof\\0.2% both for d13C and d15N. The C/N mass ratio\nwas used to check the effectiveness of the lipid\n\nextraction in the flesh and in the beaks (Post et al.,\n\n2007; Cherel et al., 2009).\n\nPrior to the statistical analysis, the assumptions of\n\nnormality and sample variance homogeneity were\n\nassessed by Shapiro\u2013Wilk\u2019s test and Bartlett\u2019s test,\n\nrespectively. A paired t test was performed to assess\n\npossible differences in stable isotope signatures\n\nbetween upper and lower beaks. A two-way analysis\n\nof variance (ANOVA) was performed to assess the\n\neffect of area, maturity and the interaction between the\n\ntwo factors in the ratios d13C and d15N in the upper and\nlower beaks and flesh. The hypothesis for the two-way\n\nANOVA was formulated under the assumption of:\n\nH0A: there is no main effect of the factor area on the\n\nstable isotope (d13C or d15N) mean value in the beaks\nupper and lower beaks and flesh; H0B: there is no main\n\neffect of the factor maturity on the stable isotope mean\n\nHydrobiologia\n\n123\n\n\n\nvalue in the upper and lower beaks and flesh; H0C: there\n\nis no additive effect of the interaction between area and\n\nmaturity on the stable isotope mean value in the upper\n\nand lower beaks and flesh. If H0C was rejected, a post-\n\nhoc Tukey test for multiple comparisons was per-\n\nformed to determine which combination of factors\n\nwere significantly different (P value \\ 0.05).\n\nLipid class analyses\n\nThe total lipid (TL) fraction was extracted by the Bligh\n\n&amp; Dyer (1959) method. Samples of &amp;1 and &amp;2 g of\ndry tissue of digestive glands and gonads were used,\n\nrespectively. The results were expressed as g lipid/\n\n100 g dry weight. Lipid classes were determined by\n\ndifferent spectrophotometric methods. The phospho-\n\nlipids fraction was purified from the total lipid extract\n\naccording to Auborg et al. (1996). Total phospholipids\n\nwere quantified by measuring the organic phosphorus\n\nin total lipid extracts according to the Raheja et al.\n\n(1973) method based on a complex formation with\n\nammonium molybdate. Results are expressed as\n\ng PL/100 g dry weight. Total cholesterol was deter-\n\nmined in the total lipids extracts by the method of\n\nHuang et al. (1961) based on the Liebermann\u2013Buchardt\n\nreaction. Results are expressed in g cholesterol/100 g\n\ndry weight. FA composition of lipids present in the\n\nBligh &amp; Dyer extract was determined by converting\n\ntotal lipids into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME),\n\naccording to the method described by Lepage &amp; Roy\n\n(1984). FAME were analysed by gas chromatography.\n\nPeaks corresponding to FAs were identified by com-\n\nparison of their retention times with standard mixtures.\n\nPeak areas were automatically integrated with C19:0\n\nbeing used as an internal standard for quantitative\n\nanalysis. The concentration of each fatty acid or fatty\n\nacid group was expressed as g/100 g total FAME.\n\nPrior to the statistical analysis, the assumptions of\n\nnormality and sample variance homogeneity were\n\nassessed with Shapiro\u2013Wilk\u2019s and Bartlett\u2019s tests,\n\nrespectively. Whenever these assumptions failed the\n\ndata were log-transformed to guarantee normality and\n\nvariance homogeneity. Two-way ANOVA was per-\n\nformed to assess the effect of area, maturity and the\n\ninteraction between the two factors in the lipid classes\n\nin the digestive gland and in the gonad. The hypothesis\n\nfor the two-way ANOVA was formulated under the\n\nassumption of: H0A: there is no main effect of the\n\nfactor area on the lipid class content in the tissue; H0B:\n\nthere is no main effect of the factor maturity on the\n\nlipid class content in the tissue; H0C: there is no\n\nadditive effect of the interaction between area and\n\nmaturity on the mean lipid class content in the tissue. If\n\nH0C was rejected, a post hoc Tukey test for multiple\n\ncomparisons was performed to determine which factor\n\ncombinations were significantly different.\n\nMajor FAs were defined as those presenting\n\nconcentration by area and by maturity stage higher\n\nthan 1 g/100 g of FAME. For each FA, the assumption\n\nof sample normality and homogeneity was tested by\n\nthe Shapiro\u2013Wilk\u2019s and Bartlett\u2019s, respectively, by\n\ntissue and factor (area and maturity), when these\n\nassumptions failed, the variable was log-transformed.\n\nDifferences in mean concentration of each FA\n\nbetween area and maturity stage were tested with\n\nt test (Zar, 1999). The major fatty acids profile was\n\ncompared by explanatory factor, area and maturity and\n\nthe interaction between area and maturity by means of\n\nMultivariate ANOVA (MANOVA), followed by Dis-\n\ncriminant Function Analysis (DFA). The MANOVA\n\nand DFA are complementary approaches based in the\n\nseparation of observation groups represented by their\n\ncentroids obtained under the effect of two or more\n\nfactors levels (Quinn &amp; Keough, 2002). DFA is\n\nparticularly useful to detect the variables that better\n\ndiscriminates between different observation groups\n\n(Zuur et al., 2007).\n\nResults\n\nDiet and habitat\n\nAccording to the mean C:N mass ratio, lipids were\n\neffectively removed from flesh (C:N = 3.13 \u00b1 0.06,\n\nmean \u00b1 standard deviation, SD) and from beaks\n\n(upper beak: 3.38 \u00b1 0.07; lower beak: 3.33 \u00b1 0.08).\n\nThe flesh of O. vulgaris females presents a mean d15N\nof 11.86 \u00b1 0.66 (SD) %, and the mean d13C value of\n-16.77 \u00b1 0.74 (SD) % (Fig. 1) independently of\narea, maturity stage or the interaction of both factors\n\n(Table 1). Upper and lower beaks present different\n\nd15N and d13C signatures between them (for d15N:\npaired t = -2.12; df = 32, P value \\ 0.01; for d13C:\npaired t = -4.14, df = 32, P value \\ 0.01). The\nfactorial ANOVA shows that area has a significant\n\neffect in d15N signature (Table 1), with both beaks\npresenting higher values in south coast (Fig. 1). The\n\nHydrobiologia\n\n123\n\n\n\nd13C signature is not affected by area in both beaks\n(Table 1).\n\nThe mean individual weight of the females col-\n\nlected was 2340.30 \u00b1 979.45 (SD) g in the northwest\n\ncoast and 2637.40 \u00b1 479.00 (SD) g in the south coast.\n\nDigestive gland and gonad presented different mean\n\ncontents in total lipids and lipid classes, with the\n\ndigestive gland presenting higher mean content of\n\ntotal lipids, cholesterol and triacylglycerol (Fig. 2).\n\nDespite that, the gonads were richer in phospholipids\n\nthan the digestive gland (Fig. 2).\n\nIn the digestive gland the mean total lipid content\n\nand mean cholesterol content depended on area. The\n\ndigestive glands collected in the northwest coast\n\npresented a significantly lower content of total lipids\n\n(t = -2.42, df = 18, P value \\ 0.01), and higher\nmean content in cholesterol (t = 7.91, df = 18,\n\nP value \\ 0.01; see Fig. 2) when compared with\nsouth coast. The two-way ANOVA for the interaction\n\nbetween the factors area and maturity showed signif-\n\nicant differences in the mean content of cholesterol\n\nand triacylglycerol due to the additive effect of the two\n\nfactors (Table 1).\n\nIn the digestive gland, the fatty acids (FA) repre-\n\nsented 31 and 46 lg/mg of the total lipid content in the\nnorthwest coast and the south coast, respectively. The\n\nmost abundant FA were the saturated fatty acids\n\n(SFA), followed by the polyunsaturated fatty acids\n\n(PUFA) and the monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)\n\n(Table 2). The mean content of myristic acid, C14:0;\n\npalmitoleic acid, C16:1n7; gondoic acid, C20:1n9;\n\nARA, C20:4n6 and DHA were significantly different\n\nbetween areas, as well as the ratio DHA/EPA mainly\n\ndue to the increase in DHA content in digestive glands\n\nof the south coast (Table 2). Results of the MANOVA\n\nanalysis showed that content levels depend both on\n\narea and maturity, with no effect on the interaction\n\nbetween both factors (Table 3). In the DFA, the first\n\nFig. 1 Octopus vulgaris\nflesh and upper and lower\n\nbeaks stable isotope d15N\nand d13C signatures by\nexplanatory factors area and\n\nmaturity. The upper right\n\nand left graphics represent\n\nthe stable isotope signatures\n\nfor the northwest and south\n\ncoast, and the lower left and\n\nright graphics represent the\n\nstable isotope signatures for\n\nimmature and mature\n\nindividuals. The dot\n\nindicates the mean value for\n\nthe d15N and d13C for each\ntissue studied; the error bars\n\nindicate the magnitude of\n\nstandard deviation on either\n\naxis\n\nHydrobiologia\n\n123\n\n\n\ndiscriminant function maximizes the differences\n\nbetween groups. The DFA for region groups show\n\nthat the first function explained 84% of the variability,\n\nwith a good separation between the northwest coast\n\ngroup (class score = 0.92) and the south coast group\n\n(class score = -0.92). The FA that contributed the\n\nmost to the group separation was the DHA which was\n\npositively correlated with the south coast and nega-\n\ntively correlated with northwest coast. The DFA for\n\nmaturity groups showed a good separation between\n\nimmature (class score = -0.85) and mature digestive\n\nglands (class score = 1.02) with 86% of explained\n\nvariation. The FAs that most contributed to the group\n\nseparation were EPA and DHA and C18:0. The DFA\n\nfor area x maturity groups (Fig. 3, digestive gland)\n\nshowed a poor separation between groups with an\n\nexplained variance of 51% in accordance with MA-\n\nNOVA results. Nevertheless, the FAs that contributed\n\nthe most to the group separation were: DHA, posi-\n\ntively related with immature females of the south coast\n\narea and negatively related with the immature and\n\nmature females from northwest coast: EPA, positively\n\nrelated with the immature females, and negatively\n\nrelated with the northwest coast mature females.\n\nMaturity\n\nStable isotope signatures showed that the d13C signa-\nture is statistically significant different with the\n\nmaturity stage (Table 1), with the beaks of immature\n\nfemales presenting significant higher d13C signature\n(Fig. 1).\n\nThe effect of different nutritional levels on maturity\n\nwas studied by assessing differences in the digestive\n\ngland and gonads with maturity. For the digestive\n\ngland, there was no effect of this factor in the lipid\n\nclasses content studied (Table 1). Total lipid, choles-\n\nterol and triacylglycerol contents tended to increase\n\nfrom immature to mature females although this\n\nincrease is not statistically significant. In relation to\n\nthe phospholipid content, the digestive glands of\n\nmature females of south coast were significantly poor\n\nin phospholipids in relation to the immature ones\n\n(t = 3.50, df = 18, P value \\ 0.01) (Fig. 2). Never-\ntheless, when comparing the digestive glands lipid\n\ncontent between mature females of northern coast with\n\nmature females of south coast, some differences arose.\n\nParticularly, the total lipid content (t = -2.82,\n\ndf = 18, P value = 0.01), the cholesterol content\n\nTable 1 Two-way analysis of variance and hypothesis testing\nconsidering the applied bio-indicators, d15N and d13C, total\nlipids content (TL), Triacylglycerol content (tag), Cholesterol\n\ncontent (cho) , Phospholipids content (phosp) determined for\n\nthe upper and the lower beaks and the flesh, digestive gland and\n\ngonad by area and maturity stage (Mat)\n\nTissue Indicator Between\n\ngroups DF\n\nResidual\n\nDF\n\nANOVA\n\nArea Mat Area 9 mat\n\nF P value F P value F P value\n\nUpper beak d13C 1 29 1.16 0.29 5.68 0.02 0.02 0.88\n\nd15N 1 29 25.99&lt;0.01 0.03 0.87 0.06 0.80\n\nLower Beak d13C 1 29 2.03 0.16 7.68&lt;0.01 0.02 0.89\n\nd15N 1 29 11.98&lt;0.01 0.08 0.78 0.06 0.80\n\nFlesh d13C 1 23 0.28 0.60 4.00 0.06 0.44 0.51\n\nd15N 1 23 0.62 0.44 0.02 0.88 1.83 0.19\n\nDigestive gland TL 1 16 5.88 0.03 5.88 0.03 2.48 0.13\n\ntag 1 16 1.85 0.29 3.62 0.07 4.68 0.05\n\ncho 1 16 62.54&lt;0.01 0.13 0.72 6.44 0.02\n\nphosp 1 16 3.49 0.08 4.15 0.06 2.26 0.15\n\nGonad TL 1 16 3.48 0.08 2.35 0.14 0.49 0.49\n\ntag 1 16 1.87 0.19 1.72 0.21 0.04 0.84\n\ncho 1 16 1.22 0.29 0.01 0.92 0.13 0.72\n\nphosp 1 16 0.94 0.34 14.68&lt;0.01 1.44 0.25\n\nValues in bold indicate statistical significance\n\nHydrobiologia\n\n123\n\n\n\nFig. 2 Mean lipid classes\u2019 content in % dw (\u00b1SD) aggregated\nby tissue (digestive gland; gonad), by area (nw\u2014Northwest\n\ncoast; south\u2014South coast) and by maturity stage (maturity;\n\ni\u2014immature, m\u2014mature).

Mature gonads were rich in SFA, showing\n\nthe capacity to produce saturated fatty acids namely\n\npalmitic acid C16:0, increasing significantly from\n\nimmature to mature females in the northwest coast. In\n\nopposition, the stearic acid C18:0 in the northwest\n\ncoast decreased from immature to mature gonads\n\n(Table 2). MUFA were the second most abundant\n\nfatty acids in the gonads, with the presence of\n\nvaccenic acid C18:1n7 as a minor FA, presenting\n\nsignificant differences between the northwest coast\n\nand the south coast namely in the FA C17:1 and\n\nC20:1n9. The FA C16:1n7 was significantly more\n\nabundant in immature than in mature gonads from the\n\nnorthwest coast. The PUFA represented between 9\n\nand 13% of the FAME present in the total lipid\n\ncontent of the gonads, with the content in ARA, DHA\n\nand EPA decreasing significantly from immature to\n\nmature gonads in both study areas. In particular, the\n\nsignificant decrease in DHA in the northwest coast led\n\nto significant differences between the DHA/EPA ratio\n\nof immature and mature females in that area\n\n(Table 1).\n\nTable 3 Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and hypothesis testing to the major fatty acids profile in the digestive gland\nand in the gonads grouped by the factors area and maturity (mat)\n\nTissue Num Df Denom DF MANOVA\n\nArea Maturity Area 9 mat\n\nkWilks FPillai P value kWilks FPillai P value kWilks FPillai P value\n\nDigestive Gland 10 12 0.13 7.96 0.001 0.17 5.84 0.003 0.36 1.79 0.186\n\nGonad 10 14 0.20 5.62 0.002 0.26 4.09 0.008 0.24 3.74 0.017\n\nP value \\ 0.05 indicates significant statistical difference\n\nFig. 3 Discriminant function analysis biplots of the fatty acid\nprofiles of the digestive gland (on the left) and gonad (on the\n\nright).

The FA that\n\ncontributed the most to the group separation is the\n\nC18:0 which is positively correlated with the north-\n\nwest coast. The DFA for maturity groups showed a\n\ngood separation between immature (class score =\n\n-0.94) and mature individuals (class score = 0.79)\n\nwith 74% of the variability explained. The FA that\n\ncontributed the most to the group separation was the\n\nC18:0, positively correlated to the immature individ-\n\nuals. The DFA for area x maturity groups (Fig. 3,\n\nGonad) showed a good separation between groups\n\nwith an explained variability of 95% in concordance\n\nwith MANOVA results. The FAs that contributed the\n\nmost to the group separation were C16:0, 18:0 and\n\nARA that were positively correlated with immature\n\ngonads from both areas.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe d15N and d13C signatures in the flesh seem to be\nadequate short-term indicators of diet and habitat.\n\nCherel &amp; Hobson (2005), working on Psychroteuthis\n\nglacialis, suggested that the difference between the\n\nd15N of the flesh relative to the beaks relates to\nthe chitin synthesis and consequent N accretion in\n\nthe beaks. In the more recently formed regions of the\n\nbeaks, such as the wing, the d13C signature of the\npredator closely matches that of the prey (Hobson &amp;\n\nCherel, 2006), also reflecting to an extent the recent\n\ndietary composition. The d15N and d13C of beaks are,\ntherefore, used as indicators of habitat and diet\n\npreference (Post, 2002; Jackson et al., 2007). In our\n\nsouthern population of O. vulgaris, beak d13C signa-\nture is different between maturity stages, probably a\n\nreflection of the recent trophic history of the different\n\nmaturation stages. The higher d15N ratio in the beaks\nfrom the south coast in relation to the northwest coast\n\nis probably related to the higher frequency of occur-\n\nrence of crustacean prey (e.g., decapod crabs) found in\n\nthe diet of O. vulgaris sampled (Lourenc?o, unpub-\n\nlished data). Rosa et al. (2004b) show that the decapod\n\ncrabs are important prey of the O. vulgaris populations\n\nalong the Portuguese coast and the presence of\n\ncrustacean prey in the diet of Loligo forbesi is known\n\nto increase the d15N content of the beaks and flesh of\nthat species (Stowasser, 2004). Darnaude et al. (2004)\n\nrelate increased d15N to a significant input from river\nplumes, through the added input of d15N-rich partic-\nulate organic matter. This, however, does not appear to\n\nbe the case of our study, since river input is more\n\nimportant on the west than on the south coast.\n\nConsidering that the digestive gland is mainly a\n\nlipid reservoir and, therefore, has a high lipid content,\n\nit is the ideal organ to trace fatty acids as diet bio-\n\nindicators (Phillips et al., 2001; Moltschaniwskyj &amp;\n\nJohnston, 2006; Garc??a-Garrido et al., 2010). In our\n\nstudy the total lipid content ranged between 14.60% in\n\nnorthwest coast immature females, in line with values\n\nobtained by Rosa et al. (2004a), and 24.42% in south\n\ncoast mature females. Contrary to what might be\n\nexpected for a nutrient-rich area, the digestive glands\n\nof the northwest coast population present relatively\n\nlow lipid content in comparison to the south coast\n\npopulation, in particular to the storage lipid triacyl-\n\nglycerol. This is probably related to nutrient season-\n\nality. In March and April the pre-upwelling conditions\n\nin the northeast coast determine a low-fat content in\n\nsardine Sardina pilchardus (Bandarra et al., 2006) and\n\nhorse-mackerel Trachurus trachurus (Bandarra et al.,\n\n2001), while on the other hand phytoplankton peaks in\n\nthe south coast are common in early spring associated\n\nwith the warmer and nitrogen-rich river plumes.\n\nConditions in the south are then relatively favourable\n\nto the development of earlier phytoplankton blooms\n\ndominated by dinoflagellates (Navarro &amp; Ruiz, 2006;\n\nCrespo et al., 2012), which is corroborated by the\n\nhigher relative content in ARA, EPA and DHA\n\nproduced by the community of primary producers\n\n(Dalsgaard et al., 2003).\n\nThe high digestive gland content of C18:1n9\n\n(&amp;11% in both study areas), which is indicative of\ndeep waters prey species, and C16:0 (&amp;20% in both\nstudy areas) which is indicative of the presence of\n\nherbivorous preys, actually suggest a diverse diet\n\n(Piche? et al., 2010). Comparing both areas, the DHA/\n\nEPA ratio is exceptionally low in the north-western\n\npopulation. According to Dalsgaard et al. (2003), the\n\nDHA content should be higher relative to the EPA for\n\na carnivorous species. In their study Rosa et al.\n\n(2004b) observed the possibility of a carnivorous\n\npreys on the northwest coast, while this study high-\n\nlights a dominance of a carnivorous preys towards the\n\nsouth coast. A higher triacylglycerol content in the\n\nHydrobiologia\n\n123\n\n\n\nSouth can in addition be related with the dominance of\n\ncrustacean preys (Phillips et al., 2003) in the diet of the\n\npopulation of this area, which is also suggested by the\n\nd15N and d13C of the beaks.\nIt is, therefore, likely that during the period in\n\nanalysis the diet of the south coast population had a\n\nrelatively higher dominance of crustacean prey, those\n\nin turn recently fed on lipid-rich plankton.\n\nAs in the squids Sepioteuthis lessoniana and\n\nPhotololigo sp. (Semmens, 1998), or the cuttlefish\n\nSepia officinalis (Blanchier &amp; Boucaud-Camou,\n\n1984), the lipid class contents in the digestive gland\n\ndo not correlate directly with the lipid contents of the\n\noocytes in the gonad, especially for total lipid content,\n\ntriacylglycerol and phospholipids (see Fig. 2). The\n\nlipid class contents of the digestive gland of mature\n\nfemales show significant differences between regions\n\nbut this regional difference is not found in the gonads\n\nof the same females, which seems to indicate that the\n\nfactors triggering oocytes maturity are independent of\n\nthe nutritional value of reserves, even though females\n\ngenerally reach maturity beyond the optimum body\n\nmass and independently of gonad size (Lourenc?o et al.,\n\n2012). As income breeders that channel the energy\n\ndirectly from food to the gonad during maturation\n\n(Houston et al., 2006; Quetglas et al., 2011), the\n\ndifferent levels in triacylglycerol and cholesterol\n\nnoted in the O. vulgaris digestive glands between\n\ngeographical areas should be expected to show in the\n\ngonads as a reflection of diet. Despite that, only the\n\ngonad fatty acid profile presents significant differences\n\nrelated with both area and maturity stage evidencing\n\nnot only that the composition changes as maturation\n\nprogresses but also that there are differences between\n\nareas at every stage of the process. The gonads of the\n\nsouth coast are richer in PUFA and in MUFA and the\n\ngonads of the northwest coast are richer in SFA\n\nespecially C16:0 and C18:0. Nevertheless, the differ-\n\nences found in the ratio DHA/EPA between areas are\n\nmarginally insignificant (t = -1.86, df = 18,\n\nP value = 0.08), indicating a low impact of trophic\n\nhabitat in the quality of oocytes. These results partially\n\naggree with the results obtained by Far??as et al. (2011).\n\nIn that study, the authors found a direct effect of diet in\n\nthe DHA/EPA ratio for Patagonian red octopus\n\nEnteroctopus megalocyathus; here, although FA pro-\n\nfile in the gonads revealed different between areas, the\n\ncontents in DHA, EPA or DHA/EPA ratio are identical\n\nbetween the studied areas.\n\nIn conclusion, this study shows that, despite the\n\nvariability observed in the stable isotopic signatures\n\nstudied, d15N signature in beaks is a valuable bio-\nindicator to follow the diet history of different O.\n\nvulgaris populations, and the d13C signature has\npotential to assess feeding behaviour changes related\n\nwith maturity in O. vulgaris females. Furthermore,\n\nspecific lipid classes as the triacylglycerol and the\n\ncholesterol and its content in the digestive gland can\n\nbe used as indicators of their nutritional availability in\n\nthe local habitat. The fatty acid profile is a good\n\nindicator of both nutritional availability in the envi-\n\nronment and also of gonads quality as shown by the\n\nmain EFA content and the EPA/DHA ratio. The\n\nenvironmental availability of these EFA depends on\n\nseasonal cycles. Upwelling/downwelling events for\n\nexample determine changes in the lipidic contents of\n\nthe plankton and in turn of the prey of octopus, as\n\nevidenced by the higher total lipids and cholesterol\n\ncontent in the digestive glands of the animals from the\n\nsouth coast. In spite of their characteristics as income\n\nbreeders, it is difficult to observe a direct relationship\n\nbetween the lipid class contents in the digestive gland\n\nand in the gonad, suggesting that a measure of\n\nregulation is exerted between food intake and oocyte\n\nformation.\n\nAcknowledgments The authors wish to express their\nacknowledgment to the anonymous reviewers for their\n\ncomments, which greatly improved the final version of this\n\npaper.

Recently,  the  biomass  of  this  fishery  resource\nsharply  decreased  in  some  areas  causing  serious  concern  among  local  fishermen  and  an  effort  is under-\nway  to  advise  on  novel  and sustainable  management  measures.  In  this  context,  the  octopus  pre-recruit\naggregations  along  the  Portuguese  coast  are  identified  using  georeferenced  fishery-independent  data,\nfrom  autumn  and  winter  sampling  between  1996  and  2008.  The  relationships  between  pre-recruit  aggre-\ngations  and  several  environmental  variables  are  analyzed  to  characterize  their  essential  habitats  (EFH).\nPre-recruits  are  distributed  throughout  the  Portuguese  coast  aggregated  in  8  distinct  recruitment  grounds\nlocated on the  middle-shelf  at 11\u201319  km  from  the  coastline,  which  are  characterized  by  average  bottom\ndepths of  65\u2013110  m  and  are  associated  to major  rivers  and  lagoon  systems.  Within  each  season  pre-\nrecruit  abundance  is much  higher  in  the  south  region,  while  pre-recruit  aggregations  on  the  northwest\ncoast  showed  high  inter-annual  and seasonal  variation  driven  by  environmental  variability.  The  western\nzone adjacent  to  Ria  Formosa  lagoon  (southern  coast)  was  identified  as  the  main  recruitment  ground  for\nO.  vulgaris  along  the  Portuguese  coast.  This  is  supported  by  the  higher  abundance  of  pre-recruits  and  by\nthe recurrence  of  their  presence  in  this  area  over  the  years  analyzed,  both  in autumn  and  winter.  The\neffects of physical  variables  on  pre-recruit  abundance  modelled  with  generalized  additive  models  (GAM)\nshowed  important  regional  differences.  Bottom  salinity  and river  runoff  are  the  environmental  variables\nthat have  most  impact  on  pre-recruit  distribution  and  abundance  on  the  west  coast,  regardless  of  any\nseasonal  effects.  On  the  other  hand,  temperature  imposes  distinct  seasonal  and  regional  limitations  on\n\npre-recruit  distribution,  both  on  the  NW  and  S  regions.  Pre-recruit  preferential  habitat  is characterized\nby  bottom  temperatures  of 14 ?C,  salinity  values  around  36.0,  low  precipitation  (average &lt;200  mm),  and\ncoarse  sediments  (in  which  they  find  shelters  to escape  predation).  Some  of the  octopus  recruitment\ngrounds  identified  are  located  in  areas  under  intense  fishing  pressure,  both  by  artisanal  fisheries  using\ntraps and  by bottom  trawling.  Thus,  their  value  for the  sustainability  of  the  octopus  fishery  should  be\n\nin fut\ntaken  into  consideration  \n\n. Introduction\n\nThe common octopus, Octopus vulgaris Cuvier 1797, is one of\nhe most commercially important cephalopods worldwide. It is\n\nxploited as a target species by demersal trawl fleets and sev-\nral local fisheries, using hand jigs, pots, traps and trammel nets\nperating in southern Europe and northwestern Africa (Hastie et al.,\n\n?

In Portugal it is also one of the most important fisheries\nresources, often the most important species in first sale value,\nwith average landings of 8500 tonnes per year (1986\u20132011). It is\ncaptured mainly with traps (?90%), thus having a major impor-\ntance in the Portuguese artisanal fishery, especially in the south\nregion (Algarve), where it accounts for more than 20% of the fish-\ning activity income (DGRM, 2012). The exploitation of octopus in\n\nPortugal increased 50% in the last 20 years, largely motivated by\nthe depletion of many finfish stocks. Recently, the landed biomass\nof this fishery resource has sharply decreased in some areas\ncausing serious concern among local fishermen and an effort is\n\ndx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2013.08.005\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01657836\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/fishres\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1016/j.fishres.2013.08.005&amp;domain=pdf\nmailto:amoreno@ipma.pt\nmailto:amorenomarques@gmail.com\ndx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2013.08.005\n\n\nes Research 152 (2014) 74\u2013 85 75\n\nu\na\n\n2\ns\nO\n(\nd\nt\nw\nm\nl\nK\ns\ns\nb\n1\nS\nt\nF\nt\np\n2\n\na\ne\na\nl\nc\n(\ne\n(\na\nc\nm\nt\na\n\ns\nl\ng\n(\nc\nh\na\na\nb\nl\na\n\n2\n\n2\n\nc\ns\na\ns\nc\nw\na\n2\nh\nc\ni\n\nA. Moreno et al. / Fisheri\n\nnderway by scientists to advise on novel and sustainable man-\ngement measures.\n\nO. vulgaris has a short life cycle of 12\u201318 months (Iglesias et al.,\n004; Katsanevakis and Verriopoulos, 2006). The spawning sea-\non extends, in general, throughout the year (Hastie et al., 2009).\nver the NW Portuguese shelf spawning occurs in two  main peaks\n\nApril and August) and on the south shelf a single peak is generally\netected in summer (Lourenc? o et al., 2012). Paralarvae are plank-\nonic and settle in the benthic habitat of adults at ca 173 mg  total\neight (Mangold, 1983; Villanueva, 1995). After settlement ani-\nals grow fast at ca. 1.2\u20131.6% d?1, reaching the fisheries minimum\n\nanding weight (750 g) at 9\u201310 months old (Domain et al., 2000;\natsanevakis and Verriopoulos, 2006). O. vulgaris is mainly a coastal\npecies (0\u2013100 m depth) with a wide geographic distribution. Den-\nity is low between 100 and 200 m and only few specimens have\neen found beyond the continental shelf break (Belcari and Sartor,\n999; Quetglas et al., 2000; Silva et al., 2002; Garofalo et al., 2010).\nub-adults and spawners generally have a distinct depth range dis-\nribution (S\u00e1nchez and Obarti, 1993; Hern\u00e1ndez-Garcia et al., 1997;\naraj and Bez, 2007). Of the environmental variables that may  affect\nhe spatial distribution and abundance of sub-adults, seawater tem-\nerature is thought to be the most important one (Garofalo et al.,\n010).\n\nHabitat modelling for marine animals is increasingly used\ns a management tool, to support conservation and sustainable\nxploitation. \u201cEssential Fish Habitat\u201d (EFH) is the habitat identified\ns essential to the ecological and biological requirements for critical\nife history stages of exploited species, and which may  require spe-\nial protection to improve stock status and long term sustainability\ne.g. Ardizzone, 2006; Valavanis and Smith, 2007). EFH may  be mod-\nlled based on the abundance of animals at specific life cycle stages\ne.g. sub-adults) and the habitat identified as the aggregation of\nbiotic and biotic parameters where individuals of that specific life\nycle stage are concentrated (e.g. recruitment grounds). Successful\nodelling depends on knowledge of species biology and ecology,\n\nhus permitting selection of appropriate variables, measured at an\nppropriate scale (see Valavanis et al., 2008).\n\nThe O. vulgaris life cycle characteristics increase resilience of this\npecies to high fishing pressure. At the same time O. vulgaris popu-\nations are vulnerable to overfishing because of non-overlapping\nenerations (Boyle and Rodhouse, 2005), and the sub-adult phase\nthe pre-recruits) is therefore a key life stage on which we may\noncentrate fishery management to ensure sustainability of this\neavily exploited species. The present study aims to, firstly identify\nreas along the Portuguese coast where pre-recruits of O. vulgaris\nggregate, using georeferenced fishery-independent data, that may\ne protected in future management options; and secondly, to ana-\n\nyze the relationships between pre-recruit abundance and several\nbiotic environmental variables to delineate their optimum habitat.\n\n. Materials and methods\n\n.1. Survey sampling\n\nTwo sets of bottom trawl surveys carried out on the Portuguese\nontinental coast onboard R/V Noruega and R/V Capric\u00f3rnio were\nelected for the analysis of O. vulgaris pre-recruit aggregations, the\nutumn and winter surveys. The main objective of these research\nurveys is to estimate indices of abundance and biomass of the most\nommercially important fish and crustacean species. For our study\ne selected only the surveys which used a bottom trawling net suit-\n\nble to sample benthic species, the \u201cFGAV019\u201d, with a cod end of\n\n0 mm mesh size, a mean vertical opening of 2.5 m and a mean\norizontal opening between wings of 25 m.  The sampling area\novered latitudes 36.7? to 41.8? N and longitudes 7.47? to 10.0? W\nn the NE Atlantic. Both datasets were obtained following a similar\nFig. 1. Sampling stations in autumn and winter surveys.

The tow\nduration varied between 20 and 60 min, but no significant differ-\nences were previously found in the mean abundance and length\ndistribution for several species due to different tow duration (Car-\ndador, com. pers.). The number of hauls by research cruise and other\ncharacteristics of the sampling procedure are detailed in Table 1. In\neach sampling station, all of the O. vulgaris captured were weighted\n(individual body weight, to the nearest g) and measured (mantle\nlength, to the nearest 0.5 mm).\n\n2.2. Environmental data\n\nThe following environmental variables were selected and\nassigned to each sampling station. Satellite-derived sea surface\ntemperature data (SST) were obtained for each sampling station\nfrom the AVHRR Pathfinder V.5 provided by NASA-JPL-Physical\nOceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC). Sea\nbottom temperature (SBT), sea surface salinity (SSS), and sea bot-\ntom salinity (SBS) were extracted from CTD temperature profiles\nundertaken during the survey cruises at the end of the fishing sta-\ntions. CTD data were not available for a few stations and for the\nwinter 2005 cruise. SBT data to fill in these gaps were obtained\nfrom CTD casts extracted from NODC and ICES databases. Bottom\nsediment type (BS) in each sampling station was classified based\non the fishery charts from the Instituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico as gravel (gv),\ncoarse sand (cs), sand (s), mud  (md) and rocky mud  (rm). River\n\nrunoff (RR) from the main rivers and rainfall (RA) were extracted\nfrom the Sistema Nacional de Informac? \u00e3o de Recursos H\u00eddricos\n(http://snirh.pt).\n\nhttp://snirh.pt/\n\n\n76 A.

Data analysis\n\nOctopus with body weight below the fisheries minimum landing\neight (750 g) captured during the survey cruises listed in Table 1,\nere classified as pre-recruits and their distribution and abundance\nsed to identify O. vulgaris recruitment grounds. Catches were con-\nerted into an abundance index as number of pre-recruits per hour\nrawling.\n\nThe spatial distribution of pre-recruits was analyzed and\napped with the geostatistical interpolation method, Krigging\n\nCressie, 1991), implemented in the software SURFER 9.0. Pre-\necruit abundance (PR) data were interpolated separately by\nrigging, using a linear variogram with no nugget effect, for each\nruise and also averaged for autumn and winter cruises. Distinct\necruitment grounds were identified as those areas centred at\nre-recruit distribution centroids with a mean PR ? 5 ind h?1 (in\nt least one season). Additionally, to assess the relevance of each\necruitment ground for the common octopus pre-recruits, an index\nf exclusiveness, EI was calculated as the ratio between PR and\nhe total species abundance. To verify whether the recruitment\nrounds were located in the same area consistently through time,\nn index of persistence, PI (adapted from Garofalo et al., 2010)\nas also estimated as the proportion of cruises within each season\nuring which a given recruitment ground was actually used.\n\nTo analyze the spatial distribution, the sampled area was  divided\nnto 3 regions, which are environmentally different, and 13 areas.\no analyze distribution with depth (DepthZ), the sampling stations\nere also assigned to the inner-shelf (is,&lt;40 m),  middle-shelf (ms,\n\n0\u201390 m),  outer-shelf (os, 90\u2013200 m),  and slope (s, >200 m).  The\nistance of each sampling station to the coast line (Dcoast) was also\nstimated. Total pressure (PRS) in each sampling station was esti-\nated from bottom depth. A measure of RR by cruise and area was\n\nalculated as the total runoff in each of the 13 areas. A measure of RA\ny cruise and area was calculated as the total rainfall for the period\nf each survey cruise recorded in the main coastal city in each of the\n3 areas. These values were replicated and assigned to each samp-\n\ning station within each area. Mean pre-recruit abundance was\nalculated in relation to categorized temporal, spatial and physical\nariables. The effects of these explanatory variables on pre-recruit\nbundances were investigated using one-way ANOVA, after check-\nng for normality in the sample distributions (Shapiro test), and for\nomogeneity of variances (Bartlett test). The interactions between\negion and the other variables and the interactions between Sea-\non and the other variables, were also tested by two-way ANOVA.\nhe relationships between log-transformed pre-recruit abundance\nlog PR) and the continuous physical explanatory variables: Dcoast,\nRES, SST, SBT, SSS, SBS, RA, and log-transformed RR (log RR) were\nurther investigated using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs),\nhereby allowing non-linearity in the relationships to be taken\n\nnto account. Since log PR was normally distributed we used a\naussian GAM with identity link. The nominal variables Year and\nS were also included in models. For all continuous explanatory\nariables, degrees of freedom were constrained to be less than 5\n8 + 214 78.5 444.2\n1 + 187 78.6 307.7\n3 + 372 70.2 390.5\n\nto avoid overfitting. Models were fitted using a backwards selec-\ntion starting with full models and removing explanatory variables\nwith non-significant partial effects. The Akaike Information Crite-\nrion (AIC) was used to choose the best fitting model (lowest AIC).\nMore information about these techniques can be found in Zuur\net al. (2007). Preferred habitat (highest mean PR) and habitat limits\n(PR &lt;1 ind h?1) for O. vulgaris pre-recruits within the sampled area\nwere estimated as proxies of EFH for this key life stage.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Environmental variation along the Portuguese continental\nshelf\n\nOver the Portuguese continental shelf SST is much higher in\nautumn than in winter and was ca. 2\u20134 ?C lower in the NW region\nthan in the S region. Within the period analysed autumn SST ranged\nbetween 14.0 ?C and 21.7 ?C and winter SST ranged between 11.6 ?C\nand 16.6 ?C (Fig. 2a). There was little seasonal variation in the mean\nSBT (13.9 \u00b1 0.9 ?C), but SBT was  on average ?1.5 ?C lower in the NW\nregion than in the S region. Autumn SBT ranged between 11.4 ?C and\n17.3 ?C, and winter SBT ranged between 11.7 ?C and 15.8 ?C (Fig. 2b).\nIn autumn the water column was  still stratified and important dif-\nferences existed between SST and SBT, especially in the SW and S\nregions (?5 ?C). On the contrary SST was only slightly higher than\nSBT during the winter period of water column mixing, namely in\nthe NW region (?0.5 ?C).\n\nThe expected positive correlation between temperature and\nsalinity may  be observed in the spatial variation of salinity which is\nsimilar to that of temperature, decreasing with increasing latitude\nand also away from the influence of the highly saline Mediter-\nranean waters. Despite this fact, both mean SSS and mean SBS\nalong the Portuguese shelf were lower in autumn (when temper-\nature was higher) than in winter (Fig. 2c and d). Rainfall levels\nduring autumn and winter were similar between areas 1 and 10,\nbut towards the north rainfall increased substantially, especially\nduring autumn (Fig. 3a). The highest river runoff levels occurred\nin autumn, located in areas 7, 10, 12 and 13 (Fig. 3b), associated\nmainly with the rivers Tagus, Mondego, Douro and Lima, respec-\ntively. The low saline waters from these river discharges generally\nspread along the west coast in a poleward direction, therefore with\nno influence in the areas south of area 7. The seasonal differences in\nsalinity derive most likely from the higher levels of autumn rainfall\nand consequent river discharges, which contributed to a decrease\nin salinity of coastal waters which is more significant in autumn\nthan in winter.\n\n3.2.

Distribution and abundance of O. vulgaris pre-r\n\nlong the Portuguese coast, but an important seasonality in their\nistribution and abundance was apparent: in winter, octopus pre-\necruits were more abundant and their distribution shifted towards\nhe south (Fig. 4). In winter abundance was twice as high (mean\nR ? 6 ind h?1) as in autumn (mean PR ? 3 ind h?1), in particular\nuring the winter 2005 and winter 2008 surveys. However, in the\nW region, pre-recruit abundance was higher in autumn, espe-\nially in the autumn1996 survey. Within each season abundance\nas much higher in the S region, especially in area 2, where the\n\noncentration of pre-recruits was recurrent each year.\nPre-recruits were found aggregated in eight distinct grounds, A\n\no H. In the NW region three recruitment grounds were identified\nuring autumn (Fig. 5a), located close to the mouth of river Lima\nA, only present in autumn1996 survey); close to river Douro and\nhe lagoon system of Ria de Aveiro (B); and south of river Mon-\nego (C). During winter (Fig. 5b), the recruitment ground B shifted\no the southern part of Ria de Aveiro, partially merging with C. In\nhe SW region, three recruitment grounds were also identified: D\nocated at ?140 m in autumn in the vicinity of the Nazar\u00e9 canyon\nnd shifted southwards closer to the mouth of river Tagus in win-\ner; E in area 6, close to the estuary of the river Sado with higher PR\nn winter; and the recruitment ground F in areas 4 and 5 extending\nrom the coastline to offshore of the 130 m isobath in winter. In\nhe S region the highest concentration of pre-recruits was located\nest of the lagoon system of Ria Formosa (H) in autumn (mean\n\nbove 30 ind h?1). The whole S region could be considered a sin-\n\nle recruitment ground in winter. Despite this, based on spatial\nifferences in abundance within this region, two  distinct areas of\noncentration of pre-recruits may  be identified: the recruitment\nround G centred in area 3; and H with the highest concentration\ns in (a) the autumn and (b) the winter survey cruises.\n\nof pre-recruits (winter mean above 80 ind h?1), centred in area 2\nwest of the lagoon system of Ria Formosa, as was  in autumn, but\nspreading eastwards into area 1.\n\nThe location of each recruitment ground is summarized in\nTable 2. Overall, the most persistent recruitment grounds, with\nPI = 1, were the recruitment grounds F and G in winter and H both\nin autumn and winter. Additionally, these grounds were important\nhabitats in particular for pre-recruits, showing high levels of exclu-\nsiveness (EI). The recruitment grounds in the NW region showed\nhigh EI but low PI, giving evidence of higher inter-annual variation\nin pre-recruit distribution within this region.\n\n3.3. Environmental effects and essential habitat\n\nANOVA results indicated that the individual effects of all\ntemporal, spatial and physical variables analyzed on pre-recruit\nabundance were significant. The effects of the explanatory variables\nYear, DepthZ, Dcoast, BS, SST and SBT were significantly dependent\non Region, but independent from any seasonal effects (except for\nSST) (Table 3). The effects of the physical variables related to water\nsalinity: SSS, SBS, RA, and RR, were independent both of Region and\nSeason.\n\nTo further investigate the relationships between physical vari-\nables and pre-recruit abundance, GAMs were fitted separately for\nthe NW,  SW and S regions using the above mentioned \u201cexplanatory\nvariables\u201d: Region interactions.

In general,\nre-recruit habitat seems to be limited to temperatures above\n2.0 ?C, SST > 13 ?C and SBT > 12 ?C (Table 5).\nearch 152 (2014) 74\u2013 85 81\n\nPre-recruit abundance was  consistently higher in the more\nsaline waters, with salinity ?36.0, independently of any regional\nor seasonal effects. The effect of SSS was not relevant to explain\npre-recruit distribution, but in the NW region abundance increased\nwith SBS between 35.5 and 36.2 where most data were obtained.\nMoreover, the exceptional occurrence of recruitment ground A was\nprobably related to the unusual high salinities in area 13 verified in\nthe autumn1996 survey. Episodic lower salinities also introduced\nsome complexity to the SBS effect on this region (Fig. 7c). SBS\nalso explained also the location of recruitment grounds in the SW\nregion: pre-recruit abundance increased with increasing SBS until\na maximum of ca. 36.1, decreasing towards the saltiest waters\n(Fig. 7f). In general, pre-recruit habitat was limited by SBS below\n35.60 and above 36.30 (Table 5).\n\nHigher concentrations of pre-recruits were also related to areas\nwith relatively low rainfall (preferred RA = 166 \u00b1 82 mm), such as\nin the S region (Table 5). However, rainfall was  not relevant to\nexplain pre-recruit distribution within each region (Table 4). Sim-\nilarly, the highest concentrations of pre-recruits were found in the\nS region, where there is considerably less river runoff than on the\nwest coast (Fig. 3b). Both in the NW and SW regions, distribution\nand abundance were significantly affected by RR. Although the\nmain recruitment grounds were located close to the main rivers\nand lagoon systems, i.e. associated with areas with important river\nrunoff, abundance decreased under the highest runoff levels of the\nNW region (Fig. 7d). This negative effect was not observed in the\nSW region (Fig. 7g), despite the important RR levels which occurred\nin area 7 (Fig. 3b).\n\n4. Discussion\n\nO. vulgaris pre-recruits were widely distributed along the Por-\ntuguese coast. The abundance was substantially higher in the\nsouth coastal waters than on the west coast as expected, consid-\nering that the general distribution of this species in the Eastern\nAtlantic have the highest densities towards the south, namely on\nthe north-western coasts of Africa (Balguer\u00edas et al., 2000). Pre-\nrecruit distribution in Portuguese waters was  patchy and animals\naggregated in several recruitment grounds. The area surrounding\nthe lagoon system \u201cRia de Aveiro\u201d seems to be the most impor-\ntant recruitment ground for O. vulgaris in the NW region, and in the\nSW region pre-recruits aggregated in recruitment grounds close to\nthe Tagus and Sado estuaries. Moreover, in the S region, despite the\nwhole continental shelf showed a high abundance of small octopus,\nthey were aggregated more abundantly close to the lagoon system\n\u201cRia Formosa\u201d. Consequently, some of the most important recruit-\nment grounds of O. vulgaris are located in the vicinity of estuarine or\nlagoon systems. These are highly productive ecosystems with high\nabundance and diversity of marine fish and invertebrate species,\nproviding excellent feeding conditions to the young stages of many\nspecies (Cabral et al., 2007). Species such as O. vulgaris,  which are\nstenohaline in all life stages, are not estuarine inhabitants, but may\ntake advantage of these productive ecosystems by living in their\nvicinity.\n\nThe common octopus is known to be a coastal benthic species,\nliving from 0 to 510 m in the Atlantic coasts (unpublished data),\nbut mostly restricted to depths below 100 m,  both in the East-\nern Atlantic and in the Mediterranean (Guerra, 1981; Belcari et al.,\n2002). In Portuguese waters, as in other areas of the O. vulgaris\noccurrence, juveniles and sub-adults generally aggregate in coastal\nwaters at a relatively short distance from the coastline. This is\ndances of O. vulgaris captured by bottom trawl surveys (mostly\npre-recruits) were found within the depth range of 10\u201350 m by\nBelcari et al. (2002). Similarly, sub-adult densities are higher in\n\n\n\n82 A.

Variation of mean abundance of O. vulgaris pre-recruits on the NW (black bar\nediment (BS), (c) depth zone (DepthZ), and (d) distance to coast line (Dcoast).\n\nhallow waters (20\u201340 m)  than further offshore on the NW African\noasts (Faraj and Bez, 2007). Even so, these authors located the\nreferred distribution of small octopus further inshore than the\nain recruitment grounds identified along the Portuguese coast.\n\nn contrast, a different demographic distribution was  described\ny Belcari et al. (2002), Quetglas et al. (1998) and S\u00e1nchez and\nbarti (1993) for the Western Mediterranean and by Hern\u00e1ndez-\narcia et al. (1997) for the Canary Islands, as they all observed\n\n wider bathymetric distribution of the small animals. In Por-\nuguese waters we also found a wide distribution of O. vulgaris\nre-recruits, with aggregations centred at mean depths of ?80 m,\nnd at approximately 10\u201315 km from the coast. However, the\nurveyed area of the cruises analyzed provides poor coverage of\nhe inner-shelf, especially in the S region (see Fig. 1), the region\nhere the abundance was the highest, which may  have con-\n\nributed to an overestimation of the pre-recruit preferred depth\nr distance to the coast line. Overcoming this sampling constraint,\noth the spatial distribution predicted by geostatistical interpo-\n\nation of abundance and the GAM modelling of the Depth or\ncoast effects on PR for each region indicated that PR increases\n\nowards shallow waters, and for that reason the main recruit-\nent grounds should in general be located in even more coastal\n\nreas.\nO. vulgaris adults are equally abundant over a variety of sediment\n\nypes (Mangold, 1983). Nevertheless, we observed that sub-adults\nave a preference for large grain sediments, namely gravel and\noarse sand. Despite the lack of sampling over the rocky ocean\noor, we found also the pre-recruit distribution to be closely related\no the proximity of rocky bottoms and abundance over mud  with\nock outcrops significantly higher than over soft mud. This posi-\n\nive relationship between small size octopus density and sediment\nrain size was also documented by Katsanevakis and Verriopoulos\n2004a) in Greek waters. This sediment type preference is, to some\nxtent, related to their necessity of sheltering to avoid predation,\n(grey bar) and S (white bar) regions by (a) in each research cruise (Year), (b) bottom\n\nand octopuses do it either selecting or building shelters (\u201cdens\u201d) in\nthe substratum (Mather, 1988).\n\nThe relationships between pre-recruit abundance and several\nabiotic environmental variables were analyzed to delineate pre-\nrecruit optimum habitat and eventual environmental limitations to\ntheir distribution. Using presence\u2013absence data, Hermosilla et al.\n(2011) modelled the distribution and large-scale habitat prefer-\nences of O. vulgaris in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean and\nconcluded that the area used by octopus differs from the average\navailable environmental conditions in terms of bottom tempera-\nture and bottom salinity.\n\nIn Portuguese waters salinity proved to be an important\ndeterminant for the aggregation of O. vulgaris pre-recruits. Their\ndistribution was  limited by SBS below 35.60 and above 36.30 and\nthe preferred habitat was characterized by salinities of ?36.0. The\nhighest abundance was  hence observed in the S region, where\nboth rainfall and river runoff are generally low and mean sea-\nsonal SBS has a narrow range (36.01\u201336.21, Fig. 2d). Within its\nglobal distribution this species prefers habitats with bottom salin-\nity between 30 and 45 (Hermosilla et al., 2011), and is fairly\nabundant under salinities at least up to 39 (e.g. in the Greek\nSeas, Katsanevakis and Verriopoulos, 2004a). Thus, the reason why\nwe observed a negative effect of salinities above 36.03 in Por-\ntuguese waters may  be partially related to the low availability\nof more saline waters in the study area, or that the negative\neffect relates to regional environmental tolerances. At the same\ntime, low salinity is a limitation for octopus survival (Chapela\net al., 2006; Vaz-Pires et al., 2004) and hence constrains its\ndistribution. The negative effect of SBS was  mainly observed\non the west coast. Here, salinities generally fall below 36.0 in\n\nautumn and winter, especially in the northern area, caused by\nheavy rainfall and subsequent important river discharges. Despite\nthis, as mentioned before, several recruitment grounds were\nidentified close to large rivers and lagoon systems (although this\n\n\n\nA.

The density of tick mar\n\noes not equate to low salinity water). The proximity to estua-\nine systems provides an increased availability of prey, for example\nivalves, but greatly enhances the risk of low salinity episodes. In\nact, mass mortality episodes of O. vulgaris have sometimes been\neported on the Portuguese coast and have been related to sud-\nen falls in water salinity due to intense river discharges, following\neavy rainfall periods (Ruano, 2011).\n\nThe effect of temperature on pre-recruits distribution was  also\nmportant, even if less significant than salinity. It was  observed that\nST affects the distribution and abundance of octopus paralarvae\nn their zooplanktonic habitat (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2005; Moreno et al.,\n009). However, it is expected that the subsequent life stages, living\n\ntrongly associated with the ocean floor, suffer a more intense (or\nirect) influence of the temperature near the bottom. Pre-recruits\nere found associated prefererentially with SBT between 15 and\n\n6 ?C and the main recruitment grounds were limited to mean\nce (PR) on the northwest (NW), southwest (SW) and south (S) coasts. Shaded area\nhe x-axis indicates the data points available for different values of x.\n\nSBT > 13.6 ?C. Similarly to the general distribution of the species\nin relation to the available environment described by Hermosilla\nand co-workers (2011), we found that the pre-recruits of\nO. vulgaris concentrate also under the warmest temperatures.\nOn the other hand, if compared with the habitat modelling in\nHermosilla et al. (2011), cold water (SBT &lt;12 ?C) seems to impose\na more pronounced limitation on pre-recruit distribution than to\nadult distribution. During the surveys analyzed, SBT was  quite sta-\nble within each region and no significant effect of this variable on PR\nwas  retained by the GAMs. Even so, in the NW region we observed\nimportant seasonal and inter-annual variation in distribution and\nabundance of pre-recruits which may  stand for seasonal and yearly\n\ndifferences in SBT (e.g. unusual low SBT in autumn 2004). Even if\ntemperature at the surface supposedly has less effect on the life\nstages living on the bottom, we found a significant effect of SST on\npre-recruit distribution (positive in the west regions and negative\n\n\n\n8 es Rese\n\ni\nS\na\nr\nY\na\nd\nv\n\nt\np\na\nO\nt\nu\nt\n\ns\nG\nP\nm\nt\nt\na\ni\no\ni\nd\n\ns\ni\nc\nc\no\nd\ni\na\no\nc\nt\nc\nm\nt\np\ns\no\n\nc\na\nb\ng\nu\nt\nt\no\nr\n\ni\nr\ns\nd\no\no\nw\n(\nd\n\n4 A. Moreno et al. / Fisheri\n\nn the S region). Pre-recruit preferred habitat was characterized by\nSTs of 15.3\u201316.0 ?C and limited by SST &lt;13 ?C. Furthermore, SSTs\nbove 21 ?C seem to have constrained the eastwards spread of the\necruitment ground H in the S region in 2003. In this region the\near effect was not retained in the optimum GAM for the S region\nnd consequently the inter-annual variation in pre-recruit abun-\nance in this region must be explained essentially by SST (the only\nariable in the model affected by yearly changes).\n\nOther studies which modelled O. vulgaris abundance in relation\no environmental variables found that oceanographic conditions\nlay a very significant role in determining the distribution and\nbundance during the paralarval phase (e.g. Moreno et al., 2009;\ntero et al., 2009). Inter-relationships between paralarval distribu-\n\nion, settlement and recruitment ground locations are still largely\nnknown. This is a field in which much work is still required and\nhat we expect will be evolving in the near future.\n\nBased on pre-recruit abundance, PI and EI together we may  con-\nider the winter recruitment grounds D and F in the SW region, and\n\n and H in the S region, as the main pre-recruit hot spots on the\nortuguese continental shelf, where these animals meet their opti-\num  habitat. The Ria Formosa recruitment ground (H) is probably\n\nhe most important O. vulgaris pre-recruit hot spot along the Por-\nuguese coast, showing the highest abundances both in autumn\nnd in winter. Important recruitment grounds were also observed\nn the NW region close to Ria the Aveiro (B) and south of the mouth\nf the river Mondego (C), but pre-recruit abundance showed larger\nnter-annual variation, probably associated with the environmental\nynamics of the local upwelling ecosystem.\n\nOverall, the distribution pattern of pre-recruits predicted by the\npatial interpolation might have missed the identification of some\nmportant aggregation areas. Indeed, the model predicted a low\noncentration of small octopuses in the eastern part of the south\noast. Notwithstanding, according to fishermen surveys, in this part\nf the coast aggregations occur in very shallow waters (6\u201312 m\nepth) between October and December, with higher concentrations\n\nn front of the inlets of the Ria Formosa lagoon and near the estu-\nry of the river Guadiana. In these areas, there is high abundance\nf prey, mainly bivalves (Rufino et al., 2010), and the substrate is\noarse (Rosa et al., 2013) with a high fraction of bioclasts consti-\nuted by large molluscan shells fragments where small octopuses\nan hide. Altogether, food availability and habitat characteristics\night explain the high concentration of pre-recruits in this part of\n\nhe coast. Similarly, fishermen also reported that small-sized octo-\nuses are numerous during winter in the westernmost part of the\nouth coast (between Lagos and Sagres), especially near the rocky\nutcrops in inshore waters, where they find refuge from predators.\n\nThe recruitment grounds in the proximity of Ria de Aveiro and\nlose to Ria Formosa are areas subject to intense fishing activity: the\nrtisanal fishery (traps and pots) exploits the inshore part and the\nottom trawl fishery exploits the offshore part of those recruitment\nrounds (Fonseca et al., 2008). In principle, Portuguese fishery reg-\nlations determine that small animals (<750 g) are to be returned\no the water if caught, which if respected would suffice to maintain\nhe safety of octopus recruitment grounds, regardless of the type\nf activity in the area. Nevertheless, the identification of a spatially\nestricted critical area could be useful to reinforce the legislation.\n\nThis study was an essential first step towards the understand-\nng of O. vulgaris pre-recruits essential habitat. Nevertheless, we\necognize that further information should be obtained in future\ntudies to complement and refine our research. First of all, abun-\nance based on trawl data should be complemented with data from\nther sources because the efficiency of a fishing trawl depends\n\nn the type of dens that the octopuses use in the surveyed area,\nhich varies in relation to depth, octopus size, and sediment type\n\nKatsanevakis and Verriopoulos, 2004b). Additionally, it would be\nesirable to include other sources of abundance data to have a\narch 152 (2014) 74\u2013 85\n\nbetter coverage of octopus distribution over the inner-shelf, and in\nareas with extensive deployment of artisanal fishing gears, where\nsurvey sampling is often compromised. More input derived from\n\u201cFishers\u2019 ecological knowledge\u201d (FEK) would be desirable in future\nstudies.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe  are very grateful to the survey cruise teams for all the octo-\npus sampling.
