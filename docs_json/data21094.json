GENERAL REMARKS ........................................................................................ 153 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\n1. INTRODUCTION  \n\n \n\nThe Monte Seco Tunnel, pertaining to the Vit\u00f3ria \u2013 Minas Railroad (VMR) \n\nresponsible for the transportation of ore from the region of Belo Horizonte (BH) to Vit\u00f3ria \n\n(VT), southeast Brazil, was excavated in a gneissic rock mass. Given the favorable \n\nconditions at the time of the construction (1950s), neither shotcreting nor anchoring were \n\nused for treating the rock mass. In recent years, however, as reported by the railroad \n\nmaintenance team, the instability of blocks in this and in other tunnels of the VMR have \n\nbeen reported. Although they do not indicate a generalized risk, this problem can cause \n\nsevere logistic damages to cargo transport. This theme has recently motivated researchers \n\nfrom the GeoInfraUSP (EPUSP) to develop studies to evaluate the geomechanical \n\nbehavior of the Monte Seco Tunnel. \n\nThe block instability observed in the Monte Seco Tunnel results from several \n\nfactors related to the tropical climate that have caused the degradation of geological-\n\ngeotechnical parameters of the rock mass, such as the joints shear strength and the intact \n\nrock durability and tensile strength, causing blocks to loosen from the roof and walls, \n\nparticularly in fractured and weathered zones, making excavation unsafe over the years. \n\nIn this manner, it is important to investigate how weathering affects certain regions of the \n\ntunnel and others do not. And, in the affected areas of the rock mass, to study deeply the \n\nrock matrix weathering process and to characterize his weathering grades. \n\nThe study developed for this dissertation demonstrates that geological-geotechnical \n\ninvestigations, with emphasis on structural geology and rock characterization by \n\npetrographic analyses and laboratories test are of fundamental importance for civil \n\nengineering works in tropical regions, where the weathering affects in an anisotropic and \n\nheterogeneous way the rock mass to great depths, affecting progressively its mechanical \n\nproperties. Besides that, the use of a standardized classification of the textural and \n\nmicromorphological modifications of the minerals can improve the criteria among the \n\nengineering geologists in the petrographic weathering index analyses applied to \n\nweathering grades assessment. \n\nThe fractures and foliation are the structures responsible for the weathering advance \n\nin the rock mass. The genesis of these structures has influence on the type and intensity \n\nof fracturing, in the weathering of their walls and the water infiltration along the tunnel. \n\nAmong the analyzed sectors (A, B, C and D), which showed different weathering aspects, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nsector C, a fault zone, is the most susceptible to weathering and consequently block \n\ninstability. \n\nThe gneissic rock mass presents three petrographic facies B1, B2 and B3, which \n\ncharacterize the heterogeneity of the lithotype banding. The effect of the heterogeneity \n\nwas analyzed along the weathering grades in terms of petrographic analysis, physical \n\nproperties, durability sclerometry, ultrasonic test, uniaxial compressive strength and \n\nindirect tensile strength.  Comparatively to facies B1 and B2, facies B3 was placed at the \n\nstart of the moderately weathered grade according with the weathering indexes \n\nconsidered and the related petrographic and mechanical properties. \n\nAmong the principles minerals of the gneissic rock observed in thin sections, such \n\nas quartz, feldspars, biotite and garnet, the cordierite mineral is the one with the greatest \n\nalterability. The appearance of the Meso-alteromorph texture in the cordierite and biotite \n\nminerals in the weathering grades III and IV, respectively, contribute to the generation of \n\nintra to transmineral fissures, and the resulting changes reflects the fragility mechanism \n\nof the crystalline fabric, which are the major responsible for the gneissic rock mechanical \n\ndegradation. \n\nThe heterogeneity characterization and the relationship between petrographic and \n\nphysical-mechanical weathering indexes of gneissic rocks are usually limited in the \n\nliterature as well as the bond loss effects of the cordierite weathered mineral.   For these \n\nreasons, it's believed that this dissertation brings some pioneer aspects of the \n\ncharacterization of weathering grades of gneissic rocks. \n\n \n\n2. OBJECTIVES AND DISSERTATION STRUCTURE  \n\n \n\nThe objectives of this dissertation aim, basically:   \n\n \n\n(i) Separate the tunnel regions with similar weathering aspects and correlate this \n\ncondition to the falling of blocks; \n\n(ii) Characterize, qualitatively and quantitatively, the weathering grades of the gneissic \n\nrock mass, considering its petrographic facies, through petrographic analyses, \n\nphysical-mechanical tests, and weathering indexes; \n\n(iii) Identify the minerals - and modifications in their crystal fabric - responsible for the \n\nweathering processes and the degradation of gneissic rock in the tropical \n\nenvironment. \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\n \n\nChapters 3, 4, 5 and 6 of this dissertation presents the studies which allowed to \n\nachieve the objectives mentioned above. It should be noted that each of these chapters \n\ncorresponds to an eventual publication in well-known scientific journals. Chapter 7 \n\nsummarizes the general remarks of all the work. \n\n \n\nThe development of the chapters considered several steps: \n\n \n\n1) Analysis of the basic geological surveys and the studies developed by the \n\nresearchers of the GeoInfra USP Project in the Monte Seco Tunnel region; \n\n2) Qualitative characterization of the weathering grades of the gneissic rock and \n\nquantification of these grades in terms of petrographic analyzes and the following \n\ntests: physical indices, slake durability, sclerometry, ultrasonic, uniaxial and \n\ndiametral compression. \n\n3) Organization and interpretation of test results considering weathering indexes; \n\n4) Integration of the information obtained in the previous items to develop the \n\ndissertation chapters in the format of articles for submission.

CONCEPTUAL WEATHERING MODEL OF GNEISSIC ROCK MASSES \n\nIN TROPICAL CLIMATE CONDITIONS1  \n\n  \n\nAbstract \n\nThe Monte Seco Tunnel is part of the Vit\u00f3ria-Minas Railway in Brazil and is used for \n\ntransporting iron ore. It was excavated in the 1950s through a gneissic rock mass of the \n\nNova Ven\u00e9cia Complex. Rock falls currently occur in tunnels along this railway, affecting \n\nore transport logistics. Rock block falls in the Monte Seco Tunnel are controlled by \n\nsubvertical fracturing, foliation and weathering. Fractures and foliation are the structures \n\nresponsible for the weathering advance in the rock mass. The genesis of these structures \n\ninfluences the type and intensity of fracturing, the weathering of their walls and the water \n\ninfiltration along the tunnel. The analyzed sectors showed different weathering aspects. \n\nA fault zone was identified as the most susceptible to weathering and, consequently, to \n\nblock instability. In this paper, geological investigations that utilized geoelectrical \n\nimaging and 3D terrestrial laser scanning mapping, focusing on the structural geology, \n\nlet to the development of a conceptual model of weathering advance in the Monte Seco \n\nTunnel. \n\n \n\nKeywords: weathering, structural geology, gneissic rock mass, tunnel. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1Authors: Monticelli J. P., Cacciari P. P., Futai M. M.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n3.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nThe Monte Seco Tunnel, of the Vit\u00f3ria-Minas Railway (VMR), is used to \n\ntransport ore from the region of Belo Horizonte (BH) to Vit\u00f3ria (VT) in southeastern \n\nBrazil and was excavated in a gneissic rock of the Nova Ven\u00e9cia Complex (Vieira et al. \n\n2014). Given the favorable conditions at the time of construction (1950s), neither \n\nshotcrete nor anchoring were used for treating the rock mass. In recent years, however, \n\nthe instability of blocks in this and in other tunnels of the VMR has been reported by the \n\nrailroad maintenance team. Although they do not indicate a generalized risk, this problem \n\ncan cause severe damage to cargo transport logistics. This issue has recently motivated \n\nresearchers from the GeoInfraUSP (EPUSP) to develop studies to evaluate the \n\ngeomechanical behavior at the site laboratory of the Monte Seco Tunnel (Cacciari et al. \n\n2013; Monticeli et al. 2015; Cacciari and Futai 2016, 2017). \n\nThe block instability observed in the Monte Seco Tunnel results from several \n\nfactors related to the tropical climate and have caused degradation of geological and \n\ngeotechnical parameters of the rock mass, such as the shear strength of the joints and the \n\ndurability and tensile strength of the intact rock, causing blocks to loosen from the roof \n\nand walls over the last several years, particularly in fractured and weathered zones, \n\nmaking the tunnel potentially unsafe. Hence, a detailed study of the geological \n\ncharacteristics that have influenced the weathering evolution in the tunnel is fundamental \n\nto re-evaluating the rock mass behavior. \n\nThe weathering of rock masses is widely recognized to depend on intrinsic factors, \n\nsuch as the nature of the rock, and extrinsic factors, such as the climate, topography, time \n\nof exposure and geotectonic evolution. The climate influence is manifested via the \n\noscillation of temperature and rainfall, which is the most influential factor that determines \n\nthe type and intensity of weathering processes. The topography controls the infiltration \n\nand drainage of rainwater along weathering profiles, causing erosion and deposition. The \n\nrock mass is more or less resistant to physical and chemical processes according to its \n\ngenesis and geological history. In addition to lithology, another important geological \n\naspect is the presence of certain structures, such as fractured and faulted zones (Saunders \n\nand Fookes 1970; Deere and Patton 1971; Dearman et al. 1978). \n\nGeological structures, i.e., fissures, fractures, fault zones, geological contacts, and \n\nfoliation, which result from the evolution of geotectonic regimes in geological history, \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\nare the link that connect weathering agents from the surface with the deepest portions of \n\nthe rock masses, promoting the variation in the weathering profile sequence and geometry \n\nand the building of landscape features (Delvigne 1998; Modenesi-Gauttieri et al. 2002; \n\nTurkington et al. 2005; Place et al. 2016). This connection could even be related to \n\nendogenous processes (Dewandel et al. 2017), which are more significant at greater \n\ndepths in underground excavations. \n\nThe genesis of the rock mass, chronology of the structures present, and in situ \n\nstress fields are relevant aspects in the weathering advance to the subsurface, as the flow \n\nof water, the main weathering agent, is governed by the opening of discontinuities in \n\nfractured crystalline rock masses (Freeze and Cherry 1979). The crosscutting of fractures \n\nand the current stress field could induce reactivation of certain discontinuity sets, which \n\nleads to displacement and dilation. The increase in aperture would consequently increase \n\ntransmissivity along specific paths in the fracture network (Barton et al. 1995; Ferrill et \n\nal. 1999; Konzuk and Kueper 2004; Morin and Savage 2003), influencing the weathering \n\npattern in the subsurface and spatial variation in the weathering profiles. Differences in \n\nweathering intensity with geological time may also influence the change in hydraulic \n\nconductivity of weathering profile horizons (Lachassagne and Wyns 2011). \n\nA rock mass undergoes specific geotectonic regimes throughout its history, which \n\ncould promote the development of a complex weathering pattern that is structurally \n\ncontrolled in the subsurface. This pattern is not usually considered in the main \n\nclassification models of weathering profiles applied to engineering geology. To \n\ncharacterize weathering in the subsurface, it is fundamental to characterize the \n\nconditioning properties at different scales and under different points of view, gathering \n\ndetailed and varied information about weathering advance and evolution (Ehlen 2005). \n\nIn this article, information on the genesis of geological structures, weathering \n\nprofiles, and weathering along discontinuity walls in a study area is collected and \n\ncompared with discontinuity and signal return intensity (or backscatter) maps from \n\nterrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point clouds and geoelectrical imaging profiles in the \n\nsame area. In this case, it was possible to correlate the genesis of geological structures \n\nwith the fracture intensity observed along the tunnel, the moisture identified on the walls \n\nand roof, the geoelectrical anomalies and the weathering conditions of the discontinuity \n\nwalls, allowing for a better understanding of the preferred weathering paths and, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nconsequently, the advance of weathering profiles and patterns inside the Monte Seco \n\nTunnel. \n\nThe data interpretation indicated that the tunnel has four sectors, A, B, C and D, \n\nwith different weathering aspects. The weathering advanced via F1 and F2 discontinuity \n\nsets in sectors A and C and via foliation Sn in sector B, while sector D does not exhibit \n\nweathering agents. The F2 discontinuity set of Precambrian age was reactivated during \n\nthe Cretaceous, forming a fault zone identified in sector C. Neotectonism (Cenozoic) is \n\nresponsible for the change in the drainage pattern in the study area and for originating F1 \n\ndiscontinuity set, which currently controls water infiltration in sectors A and C. The sheet \n\nfractures are closely related to opening along foliation Sn in the tunnel site and transport \n\nweathering agents in sector B. These geologic features trigger the destabilization of rock \n\nblocks that impact iron ore transport logistics of the VMR. \n\n \n\n3.2 Geological settings \n\n \n\nThe regional study of the structural geology covered the main tectonic events that \n\noccurred in the study area. The photointerpretation of the regional structural framework \n\nof the basement was carried out using Quantum GIS software, connecting the domains of \n\nFolha Aracruz (SE-24-Y-D-IV) and Colatina (SF-24-Y-C-VI) (Figure 3.1). The final \n\nproduct, represented at a 1:100.000 scale, used 2.666 km2 of aerial photos to obtain the \n\ntrace lineaments. \n\nThe Monte Seco Tunnel was excavated in a gneissic rock of the Nova Ven\u00e9cia \n\nComplex in the northern portion of the Mantiqueira Province (Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed fold belt system), \n\non the Brazilian Atlantic coast (Figure 3.1 A) (Almeida et al. 1981; Pedrosa-Soares et al. \n\n2001). The overall geology and structural framework of this province is related to the \n\nBrasiliano orogenic cycle, which includes a succession of accretionary and collisional \n\nepisodes that were mainly active during the Proterozoic to Paleozoic and were responsible \n\nfor the creation of Gondwanaland (Brito Neves and Fuck 2013). Lineaments associated \n\nwith shear zones are well recognized in the study area and are marked by the change in \n\norientation from NE and NNE in the Ribeira domain to N-S and NNW in the Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed \n\ndomain (Braun 1982). \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 - Site of the Monte Seco Tunnel. Southeast Brazil (A), Colatina Lineament Domain (B) and in \n\ndetail, the local geological map (C) (modified from Vieira et al. 2014). \n\n  \n\nThis structural rearrangement is related to the Vit\u00f3ria Ecoporanga Shear Zone \n\n(VESZ), locally named the Colatina Lineament, a NNW-trending network of fractures, \n\nfaults and shear zones that crosses the state of Esp\u00edrito Santo from Vit\u00f3ria to Atelia, \n\ntotaling 280 km in length (Vieira et al. 2014). These are the main structures that \n\ncharacterize the Monte Seco Tunnel area (Figure 3.1 B). The crystalline basement of the \n\nstudy area consists mainly of Neoproterozoic rocks (Precambrian), including highly \n\ndeformed gneissic rocks of the Nova Ven\u00e9cia Complex in contact with syn-collisional \n\ngranitoids due to tectonic movement. Cambrian rocks are also present and consist of a \n\nvariety of post-collisional granitoids of Paleozoic age, sedimentary deposits of the \n\nBarreiras Formation, and alluvial, colluvial and coastal deposits of Cenozoic age (Figure \n\n3.1 C). Mesozoic magmatism is represented by dike swarms that rarely outcrop in the \n\nstudy area and are therefore not shown in our maps. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nThe geological and structural evolution of this area is marked by a series of \n\ndeformation phases and structural reactivations accompanied by magmatic episodes, \n\nperiods of denudation and erosion, seismicity and intraplate activity, some of which are \n\nwell-established and some of which are still controversial. Regionally, 299 lineaments \n\nwere identified and are represented in the map in Figure 3.2A. The lineament attitudes \n\nand lengths were measured, resulting in the principal orientations WNW, NNW, NNE, \n\nENE and E-W (Figure 3.2B and C). The Monte Seco Tunnel was previously investigated \n\nby field measurements, and three discontinuity sets and gneissic foliation were recognized \n\n(Figure 3.3) (Cacciari and Futai, 2017). \n\nThe NNW lineaments stand out in the study area because of their frequency and \n\nlength; similarly, the WNW and NNE trends are less distinctive yet also stand out. \n\nHowever, only the NNW-trending lineaments result in a significant expression in the \n\ntunnel structural mapping. Foliation and F2 discontinuity set show the same trend of the \n\nregional NNW lineaments, which correspond to the regional-scale trend from the \n\nNeoproterozoic to the Paleozoic. Ductile structures, such as the gneissic foliation, formed \n\nduring the Brasiliano/Pan-African orogenic cycle, and the brittle structures formed after \n\nthe lateral shift of the orogeny in the early Cambrian (Alkmim et al. 2006; Vieira et al. \n\n2014). \n\nAccording to Valente et al. (2012), the set of fractures NNW mapped in Suite \n\nAtelia as a dextral transtensional strike-slip fault zone that originated in the Brasiliano \n\n(represented in orange in Figure 3.1C) was reactivated by a brittle and extensional regime \n\nearly in the Cretaceous. This was accompanied by the intrusion of small-scale dike \n\nswarms dated to 136 Ma. The Monte Alegre alignment (AFZ) fracture set, whose genesis \n\nis connected to the Colatina Lineament located S of Vit\u00f3ria (capital of the state of Esp\u00edrito \n\nSanto), shows features that indicate assimilation of the tectonic movements, reactivating \n\nsome of these structure planes as NNW-SSE normal faults (Calegari et al. 2016). The \n\nreactivations and dike intrusions that occurred preferentially along the Precambrian \n\nstructures of the Colatina Lineament are interpreted as analogous to the dike swarms of \n\nthe Ponta Grossa Arch in southern Brazil: the result of an aulacogen or aborted rift related \n\nto the opening of the Atlantic Ocean in the Cretaceous (Sial et al. 1987; Novais et al. \n\n2004; Vieira et al. 2013). \n\nThe ENE and EW lineaments are less significant in frequency and length at a \n\nregional scale, showing approximately the same trend of the F1 discontinuity set in the \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\nMonte Seco Tunnel (Figures 3.2 and 3.3). F1 discontinuity set is a transversal structure \n\nrelative to foliation and F2 discontinuity set, showing angular relations and geometric \n\npatterns of conjugate pairs of shear joints with extension cracks, and are related to a \n\nnormal fault in an extensional regime. Thus, these discontinuities probably initiated in the \n\nCretaceous in brittle and extensional regimes. However, the ENE and EW lineaments \n\nhave been considered to be related to the evolution of the Brazilian Continental Coastal \n\nBasins and resurgent tectonics, which started in the Paleogene and has been continually \n\nactive during the Neogene and the Holocene. Such lineaments correspond to the initial \n\nphase of the neotectonic intraplate activity in Brazil, as registered by the initial deposition \n\nof the Barreiras Formation (Hasui 1990). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 - Mapping of lineament traces (A), rose diagram and identification of main sets of lineaments \n\ntraces (B), and histogram of respective lengths in km (C). \n\n \n\nSome of the NE- to ENE-trending normal faults of southeastern Brazil, recognized \n\nby Riccomini et al. (1989) and Riccomini and Assump\u00e7\u00e3o (1999), are associated with a \n\ndistensional tectonic event whose minor tensile axis is oriented along the NW-SE \n\nquadrant. The normal faults in the weathered basement rock, as observed by Calegari et \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nal. (2016), and in the superficial deposits, as observed by Mello et al. (2005) and \n\nHatushika et al. (2005), were related to this stress state, in accordance with the orientation \n\nof F1 fractures in the Monte Seco region. \n\nF3 discontinuity set, with no superficial expression due to its low dip angles, \n\nterminates at both the F1 and F2 structures, sometimes crossing them, as noticed during \n\nfield inspections at the tunnel site. F3 is considered to be a set of sheet fractures related \n\nto the aperture of the foliation as a consequence of the hilly topography of the area. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 - Characterization of discontinuity sets by geological mapping (A) showing the contours of \n\npole concentrations (B) and rose diagram (C) of the geological structures. \n\n \n\nThe geological structural characteristics formed a relief composed of hills and \n\nslopes with pronounced declivities along valleys structurally controlled by regional NNW \n\nlineament traces. The shape of the outcropping rock is that of a sugarloaf and has been \n\naffected by weathering and gravitational pluvial events, causing the valleys to be filled \n\nwith varied materials from the hills. ENE-trending drainage leads superficial water \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\ntoward the valleys (Baltazar et al. 2010) (Figure 3.4). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 - Topographic features and their relationship with weathering, erosion and drainages in the \n\nMonte Seco site. The Vit\u00f3ria-Minas Railroad (VMR) and the local highway (BR 101) are represented by \n\nred and black lines, respectively. \n\n \n\nClimatic conditions control the intensity of weathering on the surface. \n\nDisaggregation and decomposition of the rock mass are mainly influenced by temperature \n\nand rainfall. In the study area, seasonal rainfall varies from 100 to 120 cm in the summer \n\nand from 50 to 20 cm in the winter, and the average daily varies from 28 to 26 \u00b0C in the \n\nsummer and 22 to 20 \u00b0C in the winter. According to Dearman et al. (1978), the climate is \n\ntropical, with clear contrasts between the dry and rainy seasons, characterizing a physical-\n\nchemical weathering intensity that varies from moderate to very slight (Figure 3.5). \n\nIt is important to consider the effect of the foliation of the gneissic rock mass \n\naccording to two main factors: (i) the compositional variation in the lithology, which \n\ndepends on the banding and the presence of micas in the foliation plane; and (ii) the \n\norientation of the foliation, which controls the weathering advance in the subsurface \n\n(Dobereiner et al. 1993; Le Pera et al. 2001; Marques et al. 2010; Borreli et al. 2014; \n\nRegmi et al. 2014). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.5 - Type and intensity of weathering in the Monte Seco Tunnel in the summer (red) and winter \n\n(blue) (modified after Dearman et al. 1978). \n\n \n\nIn relation to the alterability of the intact gneissic rock, this rock can be considered \n\nequivalent to an acidic (high SiO2 content) igneous rock that is more resistant than \n\nintermediate and ultrabasic igneous rocks to weathering in tropical environments. \n\nHowever, the variation in composition of a gneissic rock caused by banding can create \n\ndifferences in alterability along the rock mass. The heterogeneity of the intact gneissic \n\nrock of the Monte Seco Tunnel region is shown in Figure 3.6. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.6 - Classification of heterogeneity in petrographic facies B1, B2 and B3 for the gneissic rock of \n\nthe Monte Seco Tunnel. \n\n \n\nThe geological-geotechnical surveys, terrestrial laser scanning mapping, electrical \n\nresistivity investigations and rotary drilling took place during an intense rainy season that \n\nlasted from February to April. Therefore, the information obtained refers to conditions \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nunder which the rock mass undergoes considerable water percolation and infiltration. \n\n \n\n3.3 Terrestrial laser scanning analyses \n\n \n\nTLS was used for discontinuity mapping and analysis along the Monte Seco \n\ntunnel, aiming to obtain the discontinuity geometrical parameters necessary for stability \n\nanalyses (Cacciari and Futai 2016, 2017). Along the tunnel, 324 m was fully scanned, \n\nmapped and analyzed by Cacciari and Futai (2017). The authors were able to quantify the \n\ndiscontinuity volumetric intensity (P32) continuously along the tunnel for each fracture \n\nset (F1, F2 and F3) by using automatic window sampling methods and discrete fracture \n\nnetworks (DFNs). P32 is defined as the total discontinuity area per unit volume of rock \n\nmass. Figure 3.7 shows the orientation data from TLS mapping and some examples of \n\ndiscontinuities that were apparent on the tunnel point cloud. \n\nThe scanner used was a Faro Focus 3D (Faro Technologies Inc.), which has a data \n\nacquisition rate of approximately 106 points/s. The output of TLS is a dense point cloud \n\ncomposed of the Cartesian coordinates and signal return intensity (SRI) of each point. \n\nThe SRI varies with the color, texture and moisture of the scanned surfaces (tunnel \n\nsurface). \n\nDuring field and TLS inspections, water inflow and wet rock surfaces were \n\nidentified in three different sectors of the tunnel, named A (0-15 m), B (60-90 m) and C \n\n(110-130 m). Figure 3.8A shows TLS point cloud cuts from these sections, in which the \n\ndarkest regions highlighted are wet. In sectors A and C, the water inflow occurs via F1 \n\nand F2 discontinuity sets, respectively, while in sector B, the water inflow occurs via \n\nfoliation Sn. Sector D, from 160 m forward, remains free from the action of weathering \n\nagents and is thus used comparatively to further guide the interpretations. \n\nThe distribution of the volumetric fracture intensity of the discontinuity sets in the \n\nrock mass of the Monte Seco Tunnel are shown in Figure 3.8B. \n\nThe values of P32 related to water inflow for F1 and F2 discontinuity sets are 1.3 \n\nand 0.9 1/m, respectively, in sector A and 1.5 1/m within the entire studied rock mass. \n\nSector B, with P32 values slightly lower than those of sector A, presents water inflow \n\nconditioned by a specific plane of gneissic foliation that intercepts the tunnel over 30 m. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nIn sector C, the F2 P32 peaks on the order of 3.0 1/m, followed by that of F1, with peaks \n\nbetween 1.5 and 2.0 1/m. This sector can be treated as a singular region of the rock mass \n\nor a fault zone, where the water inflow is clearly structurally controlled by these \n\ndiscontinuity sets. Sector D presents high values of P32 that are lower than those of sector \n\nC; such high values could thus be related to water inflow, as in sector A. However, this \n\nsector (D) remains dry, free from weathering agents. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7 - Examples of discontinuities apparent on TLS point cloud (A), the contours of pole \n\nconcentrations (B) and rose diagram obtained (C) of the geological structures (modified after Cacciari and \n\nFutai 2017). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.8 - Sectors A, B, C and D used for the analysis of the weathering conceptual model (A) and the \n\ndistribution of the volumetric fracturing intensity for F1, F2 and F3 discontinuity sets, and for rock mass \n\n(F1+F2+F3) (B) (modified after Cacciari et al. 2017). \n\n \n\n3.4 Weathering profile \n\n  \n\nFrom the results of the indirect and direct investigations carried out at the study \n\nsite, the weathering characterization of discontinuity walls and the conceptual model of \n\nweathering advance in the Monte Seco Tunnel region are presented below. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nIndirect and direct investigations \n\n \n\nThe indirect and direct investigations at the Monte Seco Tunnel site consisted of \n\neight geoelectrical profiles (GPs 1-8) and three drilling boreholes (SR-01, SR-02 and SR-\n\n03) (Figure 3.9). The weathering profile characterization was compared to the slope \n\nweathering profile of Deere and Patton (1971). \n\nGeoelectrical imaging profile 1 was positioned above the drilling boreholes SR-\n\n02 and SR-03 to identify the electrical resistivities associated with the direct sampling of \n\nthe weathering horizons. The interpreted geotechnical profile from SR-01, -02 and -03 \n\nand the corresponding geoelectrical resistivity of GP 1 are presented in Figure 3.10. GPs \n\n2 to 7 were used to identify the geoelectrical anomalies related to fracture intensity, \n\nmoisture presence and weathering profile pattern changes along the tunnel region and are \n\npresented in Figure 3.11. The steep valley on the tunnel site hindered positioning the \n\ngeoelectrical imaging profiles perpendicular to the tunnel axis. Nevertheless, it was \n\npossible to include GP 8, which was positioned above an intensely fractured zone \n\nobserved inside the tunnel (Figure 3.12). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.9 - Location of the first 340 m of the Monte Seco tunnel and geotechnical investigation \n\nperformed at tunnel site (Cacciari and Futai 2016). \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe local weathering profile consists of three weathering horizons: I \u2013 transported \n\nsoil, II \u2013 very to moderately weathered rock, and III \u2013 weakly weathered rock (Figures \n\n3.10 and 3.11). \n\nHorizon I contains soil and various sizes of rock blocks that are partly weathered. \n\nThe transported soil that covers the rock mass is characterized as an orange to reddish \n\nsilty sand. In the electrical resistivity investigations, the soil is distinguished by its low \n\nresistivity, which is less than 750 Ohm.m, with respect to the higher resistivities \n\ninterpreted as rock blocks with different weathering grades. \n\nHorizon II is associated with an abrupt change in resistivity from 700 to 1700 \n\nOhm.m; in the drilling boreholes, it is associated with fractured and weathered zones \n\npresenting mineral discoloration, iron oxide and hydroxide impregnation, and weakened \n\nstructure, due to its relatively easy fracturing under hammer blows. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.10 - Geotechnical profile from SR-01, 02 and 03, the correspondent geoelectrical profile 1 and \n\nthe drilling boreholes illustrating the contrast between the weathering horizon along the valley. \n\n \n\nHorizon III is defined by its high resistivity (higher than 1700 Ohm.m) and by the \n\nvisual and tactile characteristics of a fresh to slightly weathered rock. In this horizon, only \n\nthe discontinuity walls show significant weathering, as observed in the drilling boreholes. \n\nThe thickness of horizon I varies from 20 to 30 m in the valley and decreases \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nsignificantly with a higher incidence of rock blocks toward the slope face, where an abrupt \n\ncontact between horizons I and III is found. This trend was also noticed in the outcrops \n\nclose to the Monte Seco Tunnel site (Figure 3.13). The absence of intermediate horizons \n\nand the development of horizon II, whose thickness varies from a few centimeters to a \n\nfew meters, is related to the environmental conditions, the presence of fractures and the \n\norientation of the foliation. \n\nThe foliation dips subparallel to the slope of the hillside. Despite the downward \n\nflow of water, in a nonfractured portion of the rock mass, the weathering front cannot \n\nadvance. However, an increase in the subvertical fracturing related to F1 and F2 increases \n\nthe volume of rock in contact with weathering agents, consequently developing a very to \n\nmoderately weathered rock mass. \n\nThe interpretation of the top of the bedrock, the contact between horizon I and \n\nhorizons II-III, and the low-resistivity anomalies related to the fractured zones, inflow \n\nand weathering around the Monte Seco Tunnel were highlighted in the geoelectrical \n\nprofiles (Figures 3.11 and 3.12). The low-resistivity anomaly identified in GP 2 is \n\nassociated with the E-W drainage, leading to water inflow into sector A. The low-\n\nresistivity anomalies identified in GPs 4, 5 and 7 are associated with sector D and with \n\nthe E-W drainage. In contrast the drainage in to sector A, that in sector D does not lead to \n\nwater inflow into sector D, which indicates a lack of interconnection of the discontinuity \n\nsets from 160 m forward. The low-resistivity anomalies identified in GP 3 are related to \n\nsectors B and C, where the water inflow is controlled by the foliation and by the fault \n\nzone, respectively. This fault zone is more clearly identifiable in GP 8, where the \n\ngeometry of the low-resistivity anomaly is structurally controlled by discontinuity set F2. \n\nNotably, there is no drainage related to sectors B and C (Figure 3.9). In sector B, \n\nthe direction of the water inflow follows the dip of the bedrock, whereas in sector C, it \n\nfollows the dip of discontinuity set F2. \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.11 - Geoelectrical profiles illustrating the contrast between the weathering horizon along the \n\nvalley (GP 2 to 7) and geoelectrical anomalies related to the sectors A, B, C and D of the TLS mapping. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.12 - Geoelectrical profile perpendicularly to the tunnel axis (GP 8) and geoelectrical anomaly \n\nrelated to the sector C. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.13 - Contact between weathering horizons I and III, close to the Monte Seco Tunnel site. \n\n \n\nWeathering of discontinuity walls \n\n \n\nThe weathering condition of the discontinuity walls was characterized by tactile \n\nand visual features using drilling boreholes. Parameter Ja, the \u201cjoint weathering number\u201d, \n\ndefined in the geomechanical classification system of rock masses known as the Q System \n\n(Barton et al. 1974), is treated as a key parameter in this study because it allows for fast \n\nassessment of the relative aperture of discontinuities related to the changes induced by \n\ntectonic stresses and rock mass weathering. \n\nParameter Ja is subdivided into three categories according to the width of the \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\ndiscontinuity, the relative degree of displacement between the walls, the tactile and visual \n\nfeatures (Table 3.1). Additionally, thin sections were described to compare the mineral \n\nconditions at the surface of the discontinuity sets. The thin sections were collected parallel \n\nto the discontinuity wall. The discontinuity walls were sampled at the weathering front of \n\nthe rock mass (horizon III) by cutting a thin layer of rock from the discontinuity plane. \n\nThe information obtained was correlated with the apparent physical indexes, in \n\naccordance with International Society for Rock Mechanics (ISRM) procedures (ISRM, \n\n1979). \n\nThe most representative samples showing the weathering along discontinuity \n\nwalls and the differences in the petrographic characteristics are shown in Figure 3.14. The \n\nJa classification and the physical properties of the samples, denoted D1 to D13, are \n\npresented in Table 3.2. \n\nF1 and F3 discontinuity sets, as well as the foliation planes that split during core \n\ndrilling, are characterized as rock-wall contacts with no relative displacement between \n\nthe walls. The F1 samples showed higher residual friction angles then the foliation \n\nsamples, which showed lower angles due to weathering increasing. The F2 discontinuity \n\nset also showed weathering aspects, such the thin fillings and rock-wall contacts with less \n\nthan 10 cm of relative displacement (Table 3.2). \n\nThe walls of F1 discontinuity set are usually unaltered but slightly stained and \n\npresent stretch marks. The petrographic analysis revealed a thin edge of intra- to \n\ntransmineral unfilled fissures parallel to the discontinuity wall (Figure 3.14A). On the \n\nother hand, the walls of F2 discontinuity set (Figure 3.14B) and the foliation (Figure \n\n3.14C) exhibit more advanced weathering grades, marked by coatings and stained and \n\nweakly weathered minerals: in the thin sections, a greater thickness of the fissure \n\nmicrosystem and stronger weathering of the wall minerals are observed. In these \n\nlocations, the intra- to transmineral fissures are impregnated with iron oxides and \n\nhydroxides, and the original minerals are replaced with carbonate and clay minerals \n\n(pinite, chlorite and sericite). \n\nF2 samples D5 and D7 and foliation sample D13 have notable weathering \n\nintensities (Table 3.2). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nSample D7 has well-consolidated fillings consisting of iron oxides and hydroxides \n\nand clay mineral coatings, indicating connections between discontinuities along the \n\nweathering profile. These connections can be related to the tectonic reactivation event \n\nthat could have promoted an increase in fracture intensity and a significant displacement \n\nand dilation, increasing the discontinuity aperture and water flow, consequently \n\nweathering the walls and filling the apertures with secondary products. \n\nThe most susceptible minerals to weathering occur in bands through the intact \n\nrock; in this case, cordierite is replaced by pinite, chlorite and iron oxides and hydroxides \n\n(Figure 3.14). \n\nThis weathering path may reach significant distances, as shown in sample D13, \n\nwhere the presence of a weathered band composed of carbonate and clay minerals in the \n\nfoliation plane caused fracturing when the rock was drilled from a previously intact \n\nportion of the rock mass. It is possible that a conductivity fracture is present nearby, \n\nproviding water that weathered the rock, but was not sampled by drilling. Alternatively, \n\nthe weathering may have occurred along specific planes of the foliation due to the \n\ncomplexity of the gneissic banding of the rock mass, constituting a significant subsurface \n\nweathering path that depends on the rock structure and composition. \n\nDespite the limited number of discontinuity samples from the drilling cores, the \n\nfoliation and discontinuity set F2 can be classified as advanced weathered, as observed \n\nby its tactile and visual features and the high apparent porosity and respective low average \n\nresidual friction angle estimated by parameter Ja (Figure 3.15). In this interpretation, the \n\nhigh secondary porosity is assumed to be only related to the weathering of the thin layer \n\nof rock on the discontinuity wall. Among the physical properties, the residual friction \n\nangle against the porosity presented the highest coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.85) \n\n(Figure 3.15). \n\nThis correlation may indicate unfavorable geological structures through the \n\ngeomechanical classification applied to drilling boreholes and could be used as additional \n\ninformation to characterize the weathering of discontinuity sets. \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nTable 3.1 - Joint alteration number \u2013 Ja (Barton et al. 1974) \n\nJoint weathering number \u2013 Ja (Barton et al. 1974) \n?r \n\napprox. \nJa \n\na) Rock-wall contact (no mineral fillings, only coatings) \n\nA Tightly healed, hard, nonsoftening, impermeable filling, i.e., quartz or epidote. - 0.75 \n\nB Unaltered joint walls, surface staining only. 25-35\u00b0 1 \n\nC Slightly altered joint walls.

The data gathered \n\nindicate five conditioning agents: (i) water inflow via fractures and foliation; (ii) rock \n\ncover and (iii) P32, which were correlated with the (iv) genesis of the geological structures \n\nand (v) weathering of discontinuity walls. The discrimination of these sectors and the \n\nfollowing comments helped elucidate the conceptual model of weathering advance at this \n\nsite, as presented in Figure 3.17. \n\nThe genesis of the foliation and the F2 discontinuity set is related to the Brasiliano \n\norogenic cycle, the ductile-brittle regime active during the formation of the gneissic \n\ncrystalline basement from the Neoproterozoic to the Paleozoic. F2 discontinuity set \n\nconsists of fractures from the NNW-trending structural lineament set of the Colatina \n\nLineament. At the regional scale, the most persistent fractures were reactivated as normal \n\nfaults or were intruded by dikes in a distensional and brittle regime during Pangea \n\nfragmentation and opening of the South Atlantic Ocean in the beginning of the Cretaceous \n\n(Figures 3.1-3 and 3.7). Sector C may have been tectonically affected during this event, \n\nthus forming a fault zone, which is an intensely fractured region (Figures 3.16 and 3.17), \n\nwhere some structural planes were displaced in relation to others at different intensities. \n\nThis movement is corroborated by the presence of thick weathering on the walls of F2 \n\ndiscontinuity set, as seen in the drill cores (Table 3.2 and Figure 3.14). \n\nAmong the stress states during the end of the Pleistocene and beginning of the \n\nHolocene (Cenozoic), the NW-SE-trending distensional regime is related to the \n\nemergence of F1 discontinuity set at the local scale (Figures 3.1-3 and 3.7). This trend is \n\nresponsible for the formation of E-W- and ENE-trending normal faults, identified in the \n\nweathering soil of the Barreiras Formation and in superficial deposits. \n\nIn certain cases, F1 discontinuity set overlapped F2 discontinuity set, increasing \n\nthe fracture intensity of the rock mass, as observed in sectors A and D and more intensely \n\nin sector C (Figure 3.8). In the weathering profile, the presence of these discontinuities \n\n(F1 and F2) is correlated with the development of horizon II, which promotes the \n\nconnection between weathering horizons I and III, transporting the weathering agents to \n\nthe intact rock mass (Horizon III) (Figures 3.10 and 3.17). In sectors A and C, which have \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\nless rock cover than sector D, this connection could be identified by the geoelectrical \n\nanomalies and TLS analysis results (Figures 3.8, 3.16 and 3.17) inside the tunnel. \n\nMoreover, the last in situ stress state related to the genesis of F1 discontinuity set \n\ninfluenced the preferential water flow direction driving the weathering agents through \n\nthis fracture system. The unusual degree of weathering of the F1 walls highlights that this \n\nweathering event was younger and less intense than that evidenced along F2 discontinuity \n\nset, which is intensely weathered (Table 3.2 and Figure 3.14). \n\nF3 discontinuity set, related to denudation and uplift of the rock mass, formed \n\nfollowing the topography and the gneissic foliation (Figures 3.3, 3.4 and 3.7). The \n\nfoliation, parallel to the hillside, influenced the genesis of these discontinuities, which are \n\nstructurally related to the anisotropy of the rock mass. In sector B, which is only slightly \n\nfractured, the water infiltration along 30 m of a specific foliation plane (Sn) may be \n\nrelated to overlapping of the relief fractures (F3) (Figure 3.8). \n\nIn sector D, there is no interference of weathering in the tunnel, probably because \n\nit is thicker than other sectors and has a lack of connections between fractures (Figures \n\n3.8, 3.11, 3.16 and 3.17). The conditioning agents of the weathering advance in the Monte \n\nSeco Tunnel are briefly summarized in Table 3.3, in which sector C is indicated as the \n\nhighest susceptibility to weathering and, consequently, to tunnel instability. \n\n \n\nTable 3.3 \u2013 Weathering agents affecting the tunnel \n\nConditioning \n\nagents \n\nWater \n\ninfiltration \n\nRock \n\ncover \n\nFracture \n\nintensity P32 \n\n(F1 \u2013 F2) (1/m) \n\nInterference in \n\nthe tunnel \n\nSector A \nVia fractures F1, \n\nfollowed by F2 \nLow 1.3 0.9 Medium - Roof \n\nSector B \nVia foliation \n\n(Sn) \nMedium 0.5 0.5 \n\nLow \u2013 Walls \n\nand roof \n\nSector C \nVia fractures F1, \n\nfollowed by F2 \nLow &lt;2 > 2 \n\nHigh \u2013 Roof and \n\nwalls \n\nSector D No infiltration \nMedium \n\n/ High \n1 1 None \n\nObs.: Rock cover \u2013 Low (up to 1x the tunnel diameter), Medium (up to 2x) and \n\nHigh (more than 2x the tunnel diameter). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.16 Distribution of the volumetric fracturing intensity (F1+F2+F3) (modified after Cacciari et al., 2017) and indication of the sectors A, B, C and D used for analyzing \n\nthe conceptual weathering model. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.17 Weathering profile indicating sectors A, B, C and D.

Locally, these deformational \n\nevents generated the structural fabric of the gneissic rock mass, resulting in four \n\ndiscontinuity sets: F1, F2, F3 and Sn. \n\nFoliation and F2 discontinuity set show the same trend as the regional NNW \n\nlineaments, which corresponds to the regional-scale trend from the Neoproterozoic to the \n\nPaleozoic. F1 discontinuity set shows the same trend of regional ENE and E-W \n\nlineaments, which corresponds to the initial phase of the intraplate neotectonic activity in \n\nBrazil (started in the Paleogene and continued during the Neogene and the Holocene). \n\nF1, F2, F3 and Sn were mapped both by manual fieldwork and by TLS point \n\nclouds (in detail), and the results are similar between these methods. The reactivation of \n\nF2 during the Cretaceous created the fault zone in sector C, clearly observed from the \n\nTLS mapping due to the abrupt P32 increase in this portion of the tunnel. This fracture set, \n\nassociated with F1, controls the water inflow in sectors A and C, as confirmed by the high \n\nelectrical conductivity of these sections observed on the geoelectrical profiles. In sector \n\nB, a persistent and permeable foliation plane is responsible for the water inflow and, \n\nconsequently, the high conductivity, as F1 and F2 showed low intensity in this section. \n\nBecause of the aforementioned water inflow, the weathering advanced via F1 and \n\nF2 discontinuity sets in sectors A and C and via foliation Sn in sector B, while no \n\nweathering agents were observed in sector D. However, the watering grade of F2 and Sn \n\nis much higher than that of F1. As identified by the Ja parameter, the residual friction is \n\nconsiderably reduced by weathering, compromising the strength of these discontinuities \n\nand the overall quality of the rock mass. \n\nFrom the conceptual weathering model presented herein, sectors A and C should \n\nbe studied in detail for different reasons: Sector C represents the lowest rock mass quality \n\ndue to its high fracture intensity (F2 fault zone), presence of water (TLS images and \n\ngeoelectrical profiles) and, consequently, high weathering potential.

RELANTIONSHIP BETWEEN DURABILITY INDEX AND THE UNIAXIAL \n\nCOMPRESSIVE STRENGTH IN DIFFERENT WEATHERING GRADES OF A \n\nGNEISSIC ROCK MASS2 \n\n \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nThis article presents a study of the durability indexes obtained in the Slake Durability Test \n\n(SDT) and the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of three petrographic facies from a gneissic \n\nrock mass excavated for a railway tunnel without lining, which has presented problems of \n\ninstability of blocks due to long term exposition to weathering. The characterization of the \n\ngneissic rock matrix was made tactile visually and by means of microscopical petrography, \n\ncombining the tests of physical properties, SDT, UCS with weathering indexes. It is argued, \n\nparticularly, for the importance of describing the heterogeneity of the gneissic rock to interpret \n\nits influence in geotechnical parameters. The interpretation of the results indicates that the rock \n\nbeing studied presents one facies with greater susceptibility to weathering, loss of strength and \n\ndurability. This study also proposes an equation to access the alterability parameter, recently \n\nadded in the 2014 update of the Rock Mass Rating (RMR), which may be overvalued to \n\ncrystalline rocks, as observed in the analysis. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Slake Durability Index, Gneissic Rocks, Weathering Grades, Alterability \n\nParameter, RMR Update. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n2 Authors: Monticelli J.P., Ribeiro R. P., Futai M. M. \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nThe Monte Seco Tunnel, pertaining to the Vit\u00f3ria-Minas Railroad (VMR), responsible \n\nfor the transportation of ore from the region of Belo Horizonte (BH) to Vit\u00f3ria (VT), southeast \n\nBrazil, was excavated in a gneissic rock of the Nova Venecia Complex (Vieira et al. 2014) \n\n(Figure 4.1). Given the very favorable stability conditions of the rock at the time (decade of \n\n1950), neither shotcrete nor bolts were used to treat the rock, but, in the last years, as reported \n\nby the railroad maintenance team, problems of instability of blocks in this and other tunnels of \n\nthe VMR have been noticed. Although they do not indicate a generalized risk, these problems \n\ncan cause severe logistic damages in cargo transport. This theme has recently motivated \n\nresearchers from the GeoInfraUSP of the Department of Geotechnical Engineering of the \n\nEPUSP to develop several studies to evaluate the geomechanical behavior of the Monte Seco \n\nTunnel (Cacciari et al. 2013; Monticeli et al. 2015; Monticeli et al. 2016; Cacciari and Futai, \n\n2017). \n\nThe block instability observed in the Monte Seco Tunnel results from several factors \n\nassociated with the tropical climate that, through the years, caused the degradation of \n\ngeological-geotechnical parameters of the rock mass, causing blocks to loosen from the tunnel \n\nroof and walls, particularly in fractured and weathered zones, turning excavation unsafe through \n\nthe years. In this manner, the detailed study of modifications in the characteristics of \n\nheterogeneous rocks, such as gneissic rocks, in different weathering grades, has proved to be \n\nfundamental for reevaluating rock mass behavior. \n\nIn the present article information is collected regarding the durability of the gneissic rock \n\nmatrix, aiming at a better comprehension of the intact rock disaggregation in the Monte Seco \n\nTunnel. The effect of the heterogeneity of the rock, classified according to petrographic facies, \n\nis analyzed in terms of the petrographic analysis, physical properties, uniaxial compressive \n\nstrength (UCS) and durability along weathering grades, indicating in which cases the rock \n\nmatrix would be more susceptible to disaggregation and loss of strength. In general, the \n\nclassification of gneissic rocks in terms of their heterogeneity and their geotechnical behavior \n\nwhen affected by weathering, which are the motivation of this study, are themes not usually \n\nseen in the literature. Despite of the influence of the foliation in the UCS tests and the strength \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nof rock wedges and blocks, this study does not address it directly in its relation to the \n\nheterogeneity of the gneissic rocks. \n\nThis study also proposes an equation to quantify the alterability parameter as an \n\nalternative to the procedures presented in the recent update of the RMR system (Celada et al. \n\n2014). The necessity of RMR adaptations in engineering is a common practice to manage \n\nspecific geological conditions, particularly in tropical environments such as Southeast Brazil \n\n(Santos et al. 2012; Amaral Junior et al. 2016).   \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 - Site of the Monte Seco Tunnel. Southeast Brazil (A), Colatina Lineament Domain (B) and in detail, \n\nthe local geological map (C) (modified from Vieira et al. 2014). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2 UCS and SDT in RMR 2014 update  \n \n\nThe uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) is widely used in rock mechanics and is \n\nconsidered a major parameter in the RMR classification system (Bieniawski, 1989) and was \n\nkept essentially in the same way in the RMR 2014 update (Celada et al. 2014). On the other \n\nhand, the slake durability test (SDT) has been used with great success in the study of tunnels, \n\nseeking the prediction of the mechanical behavior of the substrate in certain geological \n\nconditions, in which the rock is prone to disaggregation and expansion when absorbing water \n\nor being exposed in the excavation front (Franklin and Chandra, 1972). Recently, because of \n\nits relevance to the understanding of the geomechanical behavior of rock masses, the durability \n\nindex (Id2) has been incorporated as a classification criterion in the RMR 2014 system update \n\n(Celada et al. 2014). \n\nBieniawski, in the World Tunnel Congress, Foz do Igua\u00e7u (Brazil), presented the study \n\nof Celada et al. (2014), which introduces three modifications related to the number of fractures \n\nper meter instead of RQD and joint spacing, rearranging the values of joint conditions and \n\nincorporating the alterability parameter, accessed by the Id2 and obtained by the SDT. \n\nAccording to that study, which is based on results obtained from 2,298 cases in Spain, RMR 89 \n\nconcentrates the values in their third part and the alterability parameter was chosen to distribute \n\nthe RMR values along the third and second geomechanical classes. The Monte Seco Tunnel \n\nrock mass concentrates the RMR 89 values between 56 to 62 (III \u2013 II) (Cacciari, 2014) and has \n\nan instability problem related to long term exposition of the surrounding rock to weathering. \n\nFor this reason, the use of the RMR update in the geomechanical reevaluation of the Monte \n\nSeco Tunnel, performed with a view to characterize the heterogeneity of the gneissic rock \n\nmatrix, may identify areas related to the rock falls currently observed by the GeoInfraUSP \n\nresearchers. This study will focus on the estimate of the newly incorporated parameter \u2013 \n\nalterability, regarding intact rocks. \n\n \n\n4.3 Characterization of weathering grades \n\n  \n\n The SDT was originally performed in soft and weak rocks prone to expansion and \n\ndisaggregation when absorbing water. It has also been also applied in the study of weathering \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nand alterability of igneous and medium- to high-grade metamorphic rocks, basically because of \n\nthe need to predict the behavior of the rock submitted to tropical environments (Arel and \n\nTugrul, 2001; Gupta and Rao, 2001; Gupta and Ahmed, 2007; Marques et al. 2010; \n\nMoradizadeh et al. 2016; Ahmad et al. 2017; Momeni et al. 2017).  \n\nThe durability index presents a favorable relationship with the strength ratio (Rs) in the \n\nassessment of weathering grades, as shown in Figure 4.2. The strength ratio proposed by Gupta \n\nand Rao (2001) correlates the UCS values of weathered rocks with the UCS value of the fresh \n\nrock. It was obtained for different igneous and metamorphic rocks, being correlated with the \n\nId2 of the SDT (Arel and Tugrul, 2001; Gupta and Rao, 2001; Ceryan et al. 2008; Marques et \n\nal. 2010; Khanlari et al. 2012), according to the ISRM (2015) subdivision of weathering grades. \n\nIt can be observed that for fresh to slightly weathered grades the Id2 hardly discriminates \n\nthe rock crystalline behavior as Rs (Rs > 85% and 85% > Rs > 60%, respectively) in a general \n\nweathering classification. On the other hand, starting from a moderately weathered grade there \n\nis a clear influence in the variation of the durability behavior (95% > Id2 > 80%) due to \n\nweathering intensity, which can be also noticed in strength ratio values (60% > Rs > 20%). For \n\nhighly and completely weathered grades the variation of the durability index increases \n\n(respectively, 80 > Id2 > 50% and Id2 &lt;50%) in relation to strength ratio values (respectively, \n\n20% > Rs > 5% and 5% > Rs) (Figure 4.2).  \n\nAs specific types of secondary products form and their respective quantities vary \n\nthroughout the weathering of each kind of rock, the durability index reflects the relative strength \n\nreduction and can be used to compare or distinguish disaggregation degrees of crystalline rocks \n\ncaused by water absorption, drying and SDT abrasion cycles, which are roughly compared to \n\nweathering in tropical environments. In the geotechnical practice, the use of SDT combined \n\nwith the UCS test can characterize the most important rock modifications and can be used as \n\nan important additional information for the characterization of weathering grades of igneous \n\nand metamorphic rocks. \n\n \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 - Relationship between strength ratio and durability index for some igneous and metamorphic rocks in \n\naccordance with a general classificatory approach of weathering grades. \n\n \n\nRock characteristics, such as mineral composition, grain size, structural and textural \n\nproperties (Gupta and Rao, 2000), the geometry of pores and fissures (Arel and Tugrul, 2001), \n\nand the appearance and types of secondary minerals and increasing fissures (Momeni et al. \n\n2017), are the main factors influencing rock strength and durability with weathering. For \n\nexample, the increase in the average crystal size is inversely proportional to the uniaxial \n\ncompression and tensile strength of crystalline rocks in fresh to slightly weathered rocks (Sajid \n\net al. 2016). Moreover, the mineralogical characteristics are responsible for the different \n\nalteration potentials of a rock (Delvigne, 1998) and are closely related to the durability values \n\nof the material (Dhakal et al. 2002). Therefore each kind of rock (igneous or metamorphic) has \n\na mineral composition that influences rock strength and durability with weathering and that \n\nmust be investigated thoroughly. \n\nPetrographic analyses are necessary for a better understanding of the mineral \n\ncharacteristics, their conditions and transformations. When it comes to weathered material, \n\nindices are usually used to characterize the weathered rock, such as the micropetrographic index \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(Ip) of Irfan and Dearman (1978), which has been compared to other indices to check its \n\napplicability to the characterization of different rock weathering grades (Gupta and Rao, 2001). \n\nThese authors indicate that, despite the wide range of values of this index (0-100), it is best \n\napplied to granites of varied compositions, but not to quartzites and basalts. \n\nMany authors have used the micropetrographic index, showing that it is reliable to \n\nestimate the weathering stages of different kind of rocks, including heterogenous rocks. In fact, \n\nIp can better estimate rock weathering, helping interpret correlations between weathering and \n\nmechanical degradation for geological and engineering aims (Le Pera et al. 2001; Khanlari et \n\nal. 2012; Borrelli et al. 2014; Ahmad et al. 2017). \n\n \n\n4.4 Materials and methods \n\n \n\nThe fresh gneissic rock of the study area is composed of quartz, plagioclase, alkaline \n\nfeldspar, biotite, cordierite, hypersthene, and garnet. Other minerals (sillimanite, hercynite and \n\nopaque minerals) occur subordinately and are not responsible for the loss of rock strength \n\n(Monticeli et al. 2016). \n\n The samples were carefully collected from drilling cores and outcropping rock blocks \n\nin the vicinity of the southern part of the Monte Seco tunnel in order to represent the three \n\nalteration horizons of the rock mass (Figures 3.10 and 3.17). The weathering grades of the \n\nsamples were characterized according to the proposal presented in Table 4.1, which was based \n\non Hoek and Brown (1997), BS 5930 (1999) and ISRM (2015) weathering classification.  \n\nTo consider the abrupt weathering behavior observed in field investigations and the \n\nhardly distinguishable durability of a crystalline and heterogeneous rock, the fresh (I) and \n\nslightly weathered (II) grades were grouped in grade W1. The moderately (III) and highly \n\nweathered grade (IV) were maintained in W2 and W3 respectively. In this proposal, the highly \n\nweathered grade (IV), in its tactile features, could be distinguished into highly and completely \n\n(V) weathered grades, depending upon results of laboratory tests. Unfortunately, it was not \n\npossible to assess weathering grade W2 in one of the gneiss facies for the SDT. Petrographic \n\nanalysis and physical-mechanical tests (physical properties, UCS and SDT) were carried out in \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nlaboratories of the Institute of Geosciences, EPUSP and the Engineering School of S\u00e3o Carlos \n\n\u2013 University of S\u00e3o Paulo. \n\n Initially, the characterization of the gneissic matrix was carried out by means of tactile \n\nand visual inspection and petrography. Mineral composition, structure, texture and grain-size \n\nof the rock were described, as well as an accurate description of grades, types of weathering \n\nand mineral cracking. The modal composition of primary minerals and secondary products was \n\nobtained by counting points for each facies, totalizing fifteen thin sections. The \n\nmicropetrographic index (Ip), following the recommendations of Irfan and Dearman (1978), \n\nwas obtained to investigate the mineralogical characteristics and the transformations due to \n\nweathering. This index is the ratio between the number of sound minerals (SM) and unsound \n\nconstituents (UC) that include unsound or weathered minerals (UM), fissures (F) and voids (V).   \n\nThe representative specimens of each weathering grade (Table 4.1) and petrographic \n\nfacies were submitted to physical tests. Porosity, density and apparent absorption were obtained \n\nfollowing the ISRM (1979a) guidelines. The UCS of the 53 samples were obtained following \n\nthe ISRM (1979b) guidelines. The angle (?) between foliation and load direction obtained for \n\nweathering grade W1 fell around 60\u00b0 and 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 for grades W2 and W3. \n\nWith the use of equipment and procedures recommended by ASTM D4644-16 (2016) the \n\nId were obtained during SDT. The Id values were categorized according to Table 4.2 presented \n\nin Gamble (1971) and suggested for the classification of rock durability (ISRM, 1979a). The Id \n\nvalues were also classified according to the alterability parameter from RMR 2014 update \n\n(Celada et al. 2014). The criterion is the fifth parameter of classification and is accessed by the \n\nId2 of the SDT. Table 4.2 shows that ten points are grouped in classes Very High (VH), High \n\n(H) and Medium High (MH); for the other three classes \u2013 Medium (M), Low (L) and Very Low \n\n(VL), a significant drop in material durability and longer grading intervals occur, as the value \n\ndecreases to zero. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4.1 - Intact rock weathering grades (Modified after Hoek and Brown, 1997; BS 5930 \n\n1999, ISRM, 2015) \n \n\nGrades Visual Tactile Features \nUCS by simple \n\nmeans (MPa) \n\nW\n1\n\n (\nI \n\n- \nII\n\n) \n\nFresh to incipient weathered. \n\nMacroscopically there is no evidence of \n\nweathering of minerals.

Centimeter- to meter-sized bands that \n\ncorrespond to the mesosome are characterized by a lepidogranoblastic texture and a biotite-rich \n\ngneiss foliation, interspersed with millimeter-sized light (felsic) and centimeter-sized quartz-\n\nfeldpathic lenses. Well-formed bands of granoblastic texture correspond to the medium- to \n\ncoarse-grained leucosome composed of feldspar, quartz, cordierite, garnet and opaque minerals. \n\nThe presence of these features, closely related to metamorphism of a sedimentary \n\nprototype, leads to the heterogeneity of the rock matrix. These variations, which represent the \n\ngneissic banding, were classified as petrographic facies B1, B2 and B3, according to mineral \n\ncomposition, structure, texture and grain size (Table 4.3). The most representative \n\nphotomicrographs are presented in Figure 4.3. The micropetrographic indexes for each thin \n\nsection numbered 1 to 15, with the respective test of apparent physical properties, are shown in \n\nTable 4.4 and the correlation between Ip and porosity is presented in Figure 4.4. \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4.3 - Description of the petrographic facies of the gneissic rock \n\nFacies  Structure Texture Grain size Mineralogical assembly (%) \n\nB1  \n\n  \n\n \n\nFine banded and foliated \n\nEquigranular \u2013\n\ninequegranular \nFine-grained \n\nMineral Average Ranged Mineral Average Ranged \n\nQz 36.26 30-40 Cr 15.30 10-30 \n\nLepidogranoblastic 0.1-3 mm \n\nFk 14.73 5-25 Hp 0.98 0-3 \n\nPl 12.50 5-20 Gr 0.39 0-2 \n\nBt 16.01 10-25 Ot 3.90 0-5 \n\nB2 \n \n\n  \n\n \n\nClear intercalation of \n\nlight (L) and dark (D) \n\nbands.

This \n\nmodification is accompanied mainly by the increase in grain-size of the rock matrix that \n\nvaries significantly for facies B3, rich in quartz, feldspar, and cordierite porphyroblasts \n\n(Tables 4.3 \u2013 4.4).  \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIntramineral microcracks are absent or incipient in facies B1, leading to a more \n\nevolved fissure microsystem in facies B3, marked by a significant quantity of intramineral \n\nfissures (Fi) that reach the quartz, feldspars and cordierite rims, being sometimes \n\nconnected with other Fi, forming intermineral (Fe) and transmineral fissures (Ft) (Figure \n\n4.3A - C). Some minerals only show signs of alteration in some more weatherable \n\nminerals such as cordierite in fissured portions of the rock matrix. The difference in the \n\ndegree of microcracking of facies B3 of the gneissic rock matrix showing incipient \n\nweathering causes a great difference in Ip obtained in weathering grade W1 (Figure 4.4). \n\n \n\nTable 4.4 - Physical and petrographic properties observed in thin sections \n\nSamples ?d  ?  wa SM UM Fi Fe Ft V \n\nn\u00b0 WG PF (g/cm3) (%)  (%)  (%) (%) (%) (%) (%) (%) \n\n1 \nW1 \n\nB1  \n\n2.69 0.55 0.20 98.87 1.13 1.13 0.00 0.00 0.00 \n\n2 2.72 1.55 0.57 98.21 2.56 1.79 0.00 0.00 0.00 \n\n3 \nW2 \n\n2.66 3.59 1.24 88.71 11.69 2.84 0.51 0.28 0.00 \n\n4 2.55 4.37 1.70 78.17 21.83 5.21 2.13 0.47 0.00 \n\n5 W3 2.38 10.61 4.46 60.51 39.49 4.52 1.75 1.51 0.00 \n\n6 \nW1 \n\nB2 \n\n2.74 0.77 0.28 98.60 1.40 1.40 0.00 0.00 0.00 \n\n7 2.69 1.65 0.60 91.46 8.54 2.05 0.49 0.00 0.00 \n\n8 \nW2 \n\n2.69 2.63 0.98 83.05 16.95 3.41 0.65 1.38 0.00 \n\n9 2.53 6.35 2.43 69.79 30.21 5.23 1.00 1.99 0.00 \n\n10 W3 2.30 16.31 7.09 25.82 74.93 8.29 5.77 5.30 0.41 \n\n11 \nW1 \n\nB3 \n\n2.71 0.80 0.24 73.59 26.41 6.08 0.42 0.68 0.00 \n\n12 2.70 1.63 0.61 70.82 29.18 6.52 1.91 1.69 0.00 \n\n13 \nW2 \n\n2.68 3.36 1.28 56.44 43.92 7.58 2.86 2.72 0.00 \n\n14 2.53 5.79 2.03 31.87 69.44 9.49 2.88 3.93 0.59 \n\n15 W3 2.17 13.38 6.12 21.73 78.27 5.38 3.60 8.12 1.29 \n\nObs: WG: weathering grade, PF: petrographic facies, ?d: density, ?: porosity, wa: water absorption, \n\nSM: sound minerals, UM: unsound minerals, Fi, Fe and Ft: intra, inter and transmineral fissures and \n\nV: voids.  \n\n \n\nModerately weathered gneissic rock  \n\n \n\nWeathering begins in fact with the emergence of physical-chemical alteration in \n\nminerals (quartz \u2013 cracks; cordierite, biotite, plagioclase, orthoclase, and hypersthene \u2013 \n\ndecomposition and disintegration), with the generation of secondary minerals where a \n\n\n\n72 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nnetwork of fissures (intra to transmineral) is under development, as seen in the samples \n\n3, 8, and 13, respectively from the facies B1 to B3 (Table 4.4). Hypersthene and garnet \n\nare weathered to iron and aluminum oxides and hydroxides along intra, inter and \n\ntransmineral fissures. Biotite is weathered along the open cleavage planes with the \n\nproduction of chlorite and iron oxides and hydroxides (Figure 4.3D). Cordierite is altered \n\nto pinite, chlorite, sericite and iron oxides and hydroxides (Figure 4.3E). Orthoclase and \n\nplagioclase are altered to sericite along the intra to transmineral fissures (Figure 4.3F).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4 - Relationship between micropetrography index (Ip) and porosity (?) for the gneissic rock \n\nfacies B1, B2 and B3. \n\n \n\nCordierite and the biotite lead to the impregnation of iron oxides and hydroxides in \n\nthe matrix, causing, when weathered, changes in texture by the appearance of radial \n\nfissures (Fr) in the minerals adjacent to them (Monticeli et al. 2016). These changes act \n\nas a weakening factor, increasing the coalescence of fissures into intermineral and \n\ntransmineral fissures by the physicochemical weathering of the microsystem formed by \n\nthem (Delvigne, 1998). This process weakens the bonds between adjacent minerals and \n\nfavors the advance of the weathering agents to other minerals, increasing the alteration of \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthe whole rock matrix (Figure 4.3 D and E). The whole of mineralogical transformations \n\nincreases the porosity of the rock in about 3%, while Ip values are significantly decreased \n\nfor the rock matrix classified in facies B1 and B2, following the order of the scale to facies \n\nB3 (Figure 4.4). \n\n \n\nHighly (to completely) weathered gneissic rock  \n\n \n\nWeathering had an intense effect upon the primary minerals, often causing their \n\ntotal transformation into secondary minerals, now in high quantity in the fissured \n\nweathered matrix, as seen in samples 4-5, 9-10 and 14-15, respectively facies B1, B2 and \n\nB3. The set of mineral transformations decreases Ip values to the lowest of each facies, as \n\nthe porosity of the samples drastically increases (Table 4.4 and Figure 4.4). The \n\npetrographic analyses showed that each matrix presents some particularities regarding the \n\ndevelopment of secondary minerals, types of fissures and fillings.  \n\nIt can be noticed in facies B1 that intra and intermineral fissures are more common. \n\nThe intermineral fissures (Fe) can be seen only because they are filled with iron oxides \n\nand hydroxides (Figure 4.3G), while facies B2 and B3 show all kinds of fissures (intra, \n\ninter and transmineral) particularly filled with iron oxides and hydroxides in high \n\nquantities and secondly by pinite, chlorite and sericite in the foliation plane in facies B2 \n\n(Figure 4.3H). In facies B3, fissures are filled in great quantity with sericite, secondly \n\nwith iron oxides and hydroxides only close to cordierite (Figure 4.3I). The fissure \n\nmicrosystem of each facies controls particularly the intensity of the weathering of \n\nminerals in each matrix, as observed by differences in the percentage of sound and \n\nunsound minerals in facies B1 in relation to facies B2 and B3. The micropetrographic \n\nindex and porosity were sensitive to these mineralogical aspects, showing higher Ip and \n\nlower porosity values for facies B1 in relation to B2 and B3 of grade W3 (Table 4.4 and \n\nFigure 4.4).  \n\nThe correlation between Ip and the physical properties of the petrographic facies \n\ndefines a trend along the weathering evolution that may help outline distinctions or \n\nsimilarities between samples, weathering stages and mechanical behavior. Among them, \n\npreference was given to porosity, because it presents a higher coefficient of determination \n\n\n\n74 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthan density and absorption. Facies B1 and B2 clearly present the same trend at earlier \n\nstages of weathering but, when weathering intensifies, facies B2 approaches the trend of \n\nfacies B3, which presents a completely distinct behavior in respect to weathering. \n\nThe thin sections of facies B3 of grade W1 (Table 4.4) show petrographic aspects \n\nthat result in a lower Ip value in relation to facies B1 and B2, despite the close values of \n\nporosity around one per cent, as indicated by the dotted line (Figure 4.4). The Ip values of \n\nfacies B3 of grade W1 are those of grade W2 \u2013 facies B1 and B2. In this sense, the \n\npetrographic index is a good additional information on the rock matrix condition in face \n\nof weathering, thus permitting us to predict certain mechanical behavior of the rocks \n\nbeing studied. \n\n \n\n4.5.2 Durability and strength characterization of the gneissic rock \n\n \n\nFigure 4.6 shows the photos of the sample assemblies after all the SDT cycles. \n\nFigure 4.7 shows the Id values according to the cycle number (n) for all facies of \n\nweathering grades W1 and W3; for facies B1 and B3 of grade W2, as it was not possible \n\nto obtain enough representative pieces of rock to define sample B2. Durability \n\nclassifications (Gamble, 1971) and the value of the alterability parameter (Celada et al. \n\n2014) taken from Table 4.2 are also shown in Figure 4.6. \n\nIn Figure 4.7, UCS and Rs were correlated with porosity, Ip and Id. To investigate \n\nthe influence of heterogeneity in the variation of the results, all data were plotted versus \n\nthe porosity of the samples (Figure 4.7A and D). To analyze the difference between the \n\nIp values for petrographic facies B1 and B2 in relation to B3, especially in the earlier \n\nstages of weathering as observed previously in Figure 4.4, the average Ip values of the \n\nthin sections of each weathering grade calculated from Table 4.4 were correlated to the \n\nmean UCS and Rs (Figure 4.7B and E). \n\nThe relationship between the mean UCS value and Id along the SDT cycles is \n\npresented in Figure 4.7C, and the best correlation (4th cycle) was used to guide a general \n\nweathering grade classification (I, II, III, IV and V) based on Rs and Id4 (Figure 4.7F). \n\nThe data from Gupta and Rao (2001) and Khanlari et al. (2012) were also plotted to \n\ncalibrate the range of values. The maximum UCS obtained for facies B1 was 164 MPa \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nand this result was used for the Rs calculations.

This behavior translates into the durability classification of facies B3 \n\nnormally in a lower category than the others depending on the SDT cycle (Figure 4.6). \n\nThe gneissic rock heterogeneity has a clear effect in UCS and Rs in weathering \n\ngrade W1 (I and II), where the porosity is lower than 1.5% (Figure 4.7A and D). As \n\ncommented by Sajid et al. (2016), the increasing grain size is inversely proportional to \n\nUCS in the earlier stages of weathering and, in parts, controls the difference noticed \n\nbetween petrographic facies B1 to B3. However, as observed in the petrographic analysis, \n\nthis strength variation is also related to the characteristics of the rock, structure and texture \n\nmodification (Table 4.3), followed by the increasing degree of microcracking triggered \n\nby the incipient process of weathering of cordierite from facies B1 to B3. These aspects \n\nwere highlighted by Ip (Figure 4.7B and E) and Id (Figure 4.7C and F), whose correlations \n\npoint out that facies B3 samples previously characterized by visual tactile features of \n\nweathering grade W1 (Table 4.1) present the behavior of petrographic facies B1 and B2 \n\nof weathering grade W2 (III), in accordance with laboratory tests. \n\nUCS and Rs values of the gneissic rock facies B1, B2 and B3 decrease with \n\nweathering, following exponential functions in relation to porosity and Id4, and a \n\nlogarithmic function in relation to Ip. The influence of heterogeneity in the variation of \n\nUCS and Rs values decreases while the porosity increases drastically (Figure 4.7A and \n\nD). Again, as with facies B3, the previously weathering grade characterized as W2 (III) \n\nshows, in fact, more signs of alteration, being classified in grade IV by all the properties \n\nstudied here (Figure 4.7). It is worth mentioning that Ip and the degradation of Id with the \n\nSDT cycles were crucial to the interpretation above, once these aspects noticed in facies \n\nB3 were not observed in facies B1 and B2, whose samples, previously characterized using \n\nTable 4.1, are in accordance with the general classification based on laboratory tests \n\n(Figure 4.7 and Table 4.6).  \n\n\n\n80 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn spite of the decreasing strength variation among petrographic facies with \n\nweathering, the characteristic transformations of the rock and the kind of secondary \n\nproducts produced in each petrographic facies are continually heterogeneous, which is \n\nslightly reflected in the increasing difference of durability between B1 and B3 along the \n\nSDT cycles employed (Figure 4.6 and Table 4.5). Facies B1 of these samples, previously \n\ncharacterized in the advanced weathering grade W3 as highly weathered (IV), was kept \n\nin this category, whereas facies B3, with lower UCS and durability values, was \n\ncomparably placed in the category completely weathered (V). Facies B2 remains in-\n\nbetween, based on UCS and Rs and Id4 (4\nth cycle) values (Figure 4.7F). Previously, Ip \n\nvalues in Figure 4.4 also indicated these aspects. \n\nAs expected, the combination of UCS and Rs with Ip and Id is sensitive to the \n\ndifferences and transformations in the rock matrix, presenting a significant reduction with \n\nweathering (Figure 4.7). The combination of weathering grades (Table 4.1), in order to \n\nprovide a brief characterization of the rock mass condition, can be applied to the tunneling \n\npractice by means of laboratory tests, considering whether weathering indexes, such as \n\nRs, Ip and Id4, are adequate to investigate the influence of heterogeneities in the gneissic \n\nrock on its physical-mechanical properties, especially those related to loss of strength and \n\ndisaggregation (Figures 4.6 and 4.7). In fact, this procedure helped differentiate the \n\nbehavior of the petrographic facies and then correct their comparative positioning in the \n\ngeneral weathering grade classification and subdivision (Table 4.6). \n\nRecently, Kahraman et al. (2017) found a strong correlation between UCS and Id4 \n\nand pyroclastic rocks (extrusive igneous rocks), and Momeni et al. (2017) indicates two \n\ncycles or more to distinguish weathering grades and capture the durability aspects of \n\ncrystalline rocks. Indeed, the correlations of Id values along the cycles with UCS was a \n\ngood procedure for weathering grade characterization and strength estimate, making \n\npossible the identification of Id4 as the best correlation. This trend (Id 4th cycle) \n\ncomparatively correlated with data collected from Gupta and Rao (2001) and Khanlari et \n\nal. (2012), both using Id2, to guide the arrangement of the scale of values of the general \n\nweathering grade classification of gneissic rock of the Monte Seco tunnel (Figure 4.7C \n\nand F, Table 4.6).  \n\nThe trend line for loss of strength and durability of the gneissic rock from the first \n\nto the second SDT cycle resembles that of a granodiorite, whereas that from the fourth to \n\n\n\n81 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthe fifth cycle resembles that of a granite, whose weathering grades are better defined by \n\nthese properties. Comparing the number of cycles needed to access the best fit line from \n\na gneissic rock to a granite, it can be remarked that the granite has a relative intensity of \n\ndisaggregation four to fifth times superior than the gneissic rock under such SDT \n\nconditions. This comparison could be used as additional information in the study of the \n\nbehavior of crystalline rocks during the process of durability degradation. \n\n \n\nTable 4.6 - General weathering grade classification of the gneissic rock of the Monte \n\nSeco tunnel \n\nPF \nTable \n\n1 \nWG \n\nIp ?

The alterability of the gneissic \n\nrock is maximum throughout the cycles from fresh to moderately weathered grades. When \n\nweathering intensifies from moderately to completely weathered grades, the categories of \n\nits durability fall, consequently decreasing the scores of the geomechanical parameter. \n\nThe value drops from ten to eight from weathering grades III to IV, and subsequently \n\nfrom eight to four from grades IV to V, this being the total number of cycles employed in \n\nSDT. In this manner, the alterability criterion indicates that the rock can only be driven \n\nto a decrease in geomechanical quality if it is in advanced weathered condition. \n\nAiming at a detailed characterization and classification of the Monte Seco tunnel, \n\nespecially considering intact rock parameters and degradation due to weathering, the UCS \n\nand alterability RMR parameters are correlated in Figure 4.8, considering the Id values \n\nalong the cycles. The number of cycles plays an important role in determining r2, \n\n\n\n82 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nespecially in Id2, the Id suggested to parameter estimative. The coefficient is 0.76 in the \n\nfirst cycle (Figure 4.8A), decreases to 0.59 in the second cycle (Figure 4.8B) and reaches \n\nthe best value (0.91) from the third cycle onwards (Figure 4.8C).  \n\nAs seen in Figure 4.8B, it is not possible to distribute the alterability values \n\nadequately among the weathering grades using the alterability parameter (Table 4.2) and \n\nId2 only, as recommended by Celada et al. (2014). Furthermore, the Monte Seco tunnel \n\nclassification would not properly discriminate the geomechanical behavior of the rock \n\nfacies, as may be later revealed in field investigations. \n\nThe increase of the number of cycles to more than three in order to better estimate \n\nthe alterability parameter clearly distributes the scores as weathering intensifies and UCS \n\ndecreases (Figure 4.8C). However, the value of the alterability parameter obtained with \n\nTable 4.2 may be, in general, overvalued for the gneissic rock along the weathering \n\ngrades. For instance, the alterability value for grades IV and V, which show \n\ncharacteristics like a residual soil, is 4 (Id4). Values around 0 would be expected, as \n\nobserved for UCS, which achieved scores around 1.5, a value much closer to the extreme \n\n0. \n\nIn this manner, as Id reflects the relative strength degradation and rock \n\ndisaggregation, showing well established relationships with UCS and Rs (Figures 4.2, \n\n4.7C and F), it can be assumed that the value of the alterability parameter could be \n\nequivalent to the strength ratio in the weathering grade characterization.  \n\n \n\n\n\n83 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.8 - Relationship between UCS and Id RMR rating values along the 1st cycle (A), 2nd cycle (B) \n\nand 3rd to 5th cycle (C).

The proposed equation (1), when compared to Celada et al. \n\n\n\n85 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(2014) (Figure 4.9B), fulfills the values of the alterability parameter along the weathering \n\ngrades, improving the initial idea mentioned by these authors, namely that of using Id to \n\ndistribute the RMR values (Table 4.7). \n\n \n\n??(???14) = 0.009[???(0.07 ??4) ? 1]                                  (4.1) \n\n \n\nTable 4.7 - The alterability parameter for a granite and gneissic rocks \n\nPetrographic \n\nfacies \nWeathering grades \n\nAlterability (Id2) Alterability (Id4)  \n \n\nCelada et al.

Among these facies structural \n\nchanges can be noticed, from foliated to massive, and also textural, from \n\nlepidogranoblastic to granoblastic, accompanied by increasing grain size, fissures and \n\ndisappearance of the micas that define the anisotropy plane of the rock (Table 4.3). These \n\nmineral characteristics generate different alterability conditions, which, in turn, influence \n\nthe specific appearance of secondary products, creating a unique mineralogical \n\nmicrosystem for each facies along weathering (Figure 4.3).  \n\nThe visual and petrographic analysis and the physical-mechanical tests (SDT and \n\nUCS) resulting in weathering indexes (Ip, Id and Rs) were able to qualify, quantify and \n\n\n\n86 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ndistinguish this mineralogical information (Figures 4.4 to 4.7), improving the weathering \n\ngrade classification for the revaluation of the Monte Seco tunnel (Table 4.6). \n\nComparatively to facies B1 and B2, facies B3 was placed at the start of the moderately \n\nweathered grade (III), because it presents greater potential to weathering, loss of strength \n\nand durability, is subject to disaggregation and therefore more susceptible to produce \n\nfragments. This aspect was highlighted by relationships between weathering indexes (Ip, \n\nId4 and Rs), which proved to be a good procedure for weathering grade characterization \n\nand strength estimate. Moreover, Id4 proved to be the best durability index to the \n\nrelationship with UCS and Rs in the gneissic rock studied. \n\nThe assessment of the alterability parameter needs to be further investigated by the \n\ngeological engineering community for a better understanding of its applicability and \n\ninfluences in tunneling in different kinds of rocks and weathering conditions. For now, \n\nwhen it comes to the gneissic rock of the Monte Seco tunnel, submitted to a tropical \n\nenvironment, the use of Id2 and the respective parameter value, following the procedures \n\nin the RMR update (Celada et al. 2014), is not adequate to express strength and durability \n\ndegradation noticed for this lithotype along the weathering grades (Figures 4.8 \u2013 4.9). \n\nMoreover, it appears to be overvalued for granite and gneissic rocks. \n\nFor this reason, an equation has been proposed, which is based on the relationship \n\nbetween strength ratio and Id4 assessed through the alterability parameter. The proposed \n\nequation contributes to a better distribution of values (10 \u2013 0) than that obtained by \n\nfollowing the procedures of Celada et al. (2014) (10 \u2013 8) (Table 4.7) as to the gneissic \n\nrock under consideration, indeed improving the initial idea these authors had of using Id \n\nto indicate differences in RMR classes. In tropical climates, such as in the southern part \n\nof Brazil, the study of adaptations in geomechanical classifications is a topic of great \n\nimportance and has been considered by several authors (Santos et al. 2012; Amaral Junior \n\net al. 2016).   \n\nThe procedure developed to characterize the intact rock heterogeneity and its \n\ninfluence on related parameters (UCS and alterability) could be tested in this tunnel as \n\nwell as in other VMR tunnels in which problems of instability have been noticed and were \n\nexcavated in different igneous and low- to high-grade metamorphic rock masses, that \n\nundoubtedly have different strength and durability behaviors according to the time of \n\nexposition to weathering. The use of the RMR 2014 update may be a significant \n\n\n\n87 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nalternative to differentiate these tunnels, once two of five parameters can be related to the \n\ncharacteristics of intact rocks. \n\n \n\n4.7 References  \n\n \n\nAhmad, M., Ansari, M.K., Singh, R., Sharma, L.K., Singh, T.N., 2017.

TEXTURAL AND MICROMORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION \n\nOF TROPICAL WEATHERING EFFECTS ON CORDIERITE IN GNEISSIC \n\nROCK3 \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nThis paper evaluates the tropical weathering of cordierite in the gneissic rock mass \n\nsurrounding the Monte Seco Tunnel, an in-situ laboratory. This tunnel was excavated in \n\nthe 1950s and, except for the entrance and exit, does not include the use of either only \n\nconcrete liners or both liners and bolts. The weathering, rock matrix deterioration and \n\narenization, promoted the edge effect of biotite alteromorphs due to its meso-\n\nalteromorphic texture. The microsystem of the foliation formed by the biotite and \n\ncordierite alteromorphs produced secondary minerals, such as chlorite and smectite, that \n\ncontributed to the fissuring and weathering. The cordierite distributed in the rock mass \n\n(intact rock), concentrated along the foliation, was destroyed by pinitization, \n\nchloritization and replaced by pinite, chlorite, sericite, smectite, kaolinite and goethite \n\nalong cleavage planes, intramineral fissures and the alteromorph rims. The corresponding \n\nweathering pattern is characterized by the generation of secondary crystalline products \n\nthat interfere in the intramineral fissuring of the adjacent minerals that form the rock \n\nmicrosystem, leading to a textural change characterized as meso- and halo-alteromorphic. \n\nThese weathered minerals contribute to the generation of a secondary fissural porosity, \n\nand the resulting textural change reflects the fragility mechanism of the crystalline fabric \n\nor the lepido-granoblastic texture. The tropical environment intensifies the effects of this \n\ntype of fragility because wetting and drying cycles allow the secondary materials that fill \n\nthe fissures to leach or expand and contract, further loosening the bonds between the \n\nminerals and compromising cohesion. When the minerals present in the foliation, such as \n\nbiotite and cordierite, undergo weathering, they promote fissuring of the crystalline fabric \n\nand the subsequent loosening of mineral bonds. \n\n \n\nKeywords: gneissic alteromorphs, cordierite, weathering, texture, petrographic indexes. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n3 Authors: Monticelli J. P., S\u00edgolo J.B., Futai M. M.  \n\n\n\n92 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nThe complex behavior of a rock mass is strongly influenced by geological structures \n\nsuch as joints, faults, and foliations and by weathering stages. This paper elucidates the \n\nweathering and degradation stages of gneissic rock in an old tunnel associated with block \n\ninstability. \n\nThe Monte Seco Tunnel is the in-situ laboratory and is located close to Vit\u00f3ria, the \n\ncapital city of the state of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Brazil, and is a segment of the Vit\u00f3ria\u2013Minas \n\nRailway (EFVM, Estrada de Ferro Vit\u00f3ria\u2013Minas). As the majority of the tunnels \n\nconstructed along this railway in the 1950s, it was excavated in gneissic rock, and except \n\nfor the entrance and exit, does not include the use of either only concrete liners or both \n\nliners and bolts. Due to the long-term exposure of the rock to weathering, the initial \n\nmechanical characteristics of these EFVM tunnels have been degraded, resulting in rock \n\nfalls from the ceiling and walls. EFVM is responsible for the transport of iron ore from \n\nthe Iron Quadrangle (Quadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero) in the state of Minas Gerais: its full \n\noperation is important because any delay in ore supply can cause logistical losses. \n\nThe detailed assessment of the present geological-geotechnical conditions of the \n\nMonte Seco Tunnel and of the other tunnels along this railway, to determine the risks \n\nassociated with rock instability, constitutes a fundamental part of several studies from the \n\nGeoInfraUSP (University of Sao Paulo) research group (Cantarelli et al., 2016, Cacciari \n\nand Futai, 2016, 2017, 2018). Among the parameters being investigated, the weathering \n\ngrades of a rock mass (intact rock and discontinuity-bearing rock) have been \n\ncharacterized based on petrographic analyses and destructive and nondestructive tests, \n\nsuch as the sclerometer test, the slake durability test, and the uniaxial compression test. \n\nRegarding petrographic analyses aiming at the definition of petrographic \n\nweathering indexes at the microscale (Lumb 1962, Mendes et al. 1966, Onodera et al. \n\n1974, Irfan and Dearman 1978, Cole and Sandy 1980, Gupta and Rao 2000, Arel and \n\nTugrul 2001, Gupta and Rao 2001, Ceryan et al. 2008), we observe that mineral textures \n\nand micromorphology are seldom correlated with patterns and evolutionary stages of \n\nweathering. For a certain weathering grade, the variation in strength of a rock is basically \n\nrelated to its texture (Sajid et al. 2016). However, when texture is described by \n\npetrographic indexes, such as the textural coefficient (TC), these indexes are neither \n\n\n\n93 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nsensitive to the mineralogical transformations related to weathering nor correlate well \n\nwith the geotechnical properties (Azzoni et al. 1996, Gupta and Rao 2001). Notably, \n\nmineral composition and textural properties, such as fissures and voids, are the most \n\nimportant factors in the determination of the strength of a rock (Gupta and Rao 2000). \n\nTherefore, to understand the physical-mechanical degradation of a rock, it is \n\nfundamental to describe the weathering processes and the textural modifications in a \n\nstandard way. The classification presented by Delvigne (1998) is an alternative to the \n\nanalysis of the textural modifications of the crystalline fabric of a rock that underwent \n\nweathering and can improve the interpretations of the petrographic weathering indexes \n\nand their relationship with the physical-mechanical behavior of the rock. \n\nDelvigne (1998) proposed a classification of weathering patterns for individual \n\nminerals of a rock based on their micromorphological and textural description. The \n\nweathered minerals are called alteromorphs and can be dealt with either individually or \n\nin groups constituting three main types of microsystems: (i) Contact: contacts between \n\nunweathered minerals. (ii) Plasmic: minerals undergoing weathering. (iii) Fissures: intra-\n\n, inter- and transmineral fissures. The identification of the microsystem, extent of the \n\nweathering and proportions of the primary and secondary minerals and pores and fissures, \n\nas well as the way that the weathering affects the minerals, are the basis of the \n\nclassification system. According to the extent of the preservation, size and shape of the \n\nprimary minerals that underwent weathering, three weathering texture types can be \n\ndistinguished: iso-alteromorph, meso-alteromorph and kata-alteromorph (Figure 5.1). \n\nDepending on the intrinsic properties of a mineral, such as its cleavage, twinning, \n\nstructural integrity, and grain size, weathering takes place in a specific way, which \n\ndetermines the mineral weathering pattern and evolutionary stages (0, unweathered, to 4, \n\ncompletely weathered), as presented in more detail in Delvigne (1998). \n\nThe objective of this study is the textural and micromorphological characterization \n\nof weathered minerals from a gneissic rock from the Monte Seco Tunnel, which has \n\nexperienced tropical climate conditions, and the roles of texture and micromorphology in \n\nrock degradation along the weathering grades. Petrographic analyses and X-ray \n\ndiffraction tests were conducted to characterize the primary and secondary products along \n\nthe weathering grades. The gneissic rock-forming minerals were characterized according \n\nto the textural classification presented in Delvigne (1998). However, we do not address \n\n\n\n94 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ncordierite alteromorphs, which are one of the main constituents of the gneissic rock where \n\nthe tunnel was excavated, and consequently its micromorphological modifications with \n\nweathering. Moreover, the description of cordierite in the literature is usually limited to \n\nits mineralogical and crystallographic properties (Prider 1945, Vogel 1975, Klein 2007, \n\nNesse 2012). In this sense, cordierite alteromorph characterization according to textural \n\nand micromorphological classification and by means of petrographic intramineral \n\nweathering indexes that are proposed here, namely, extent of weathering (Ea) and \n\nintramineral fissures (If), is pioneering work in the study of cordierite. \n\nIn contrast to the orthoclase, plagioclase, hypersthene and garnet alteromorphs that \n\nshowed textural modifications in the petrographic analyses, the cordierite and biotite \n\nalteromorphs showed an edge effect, producing intra- to transmineral fissures in the \n\nadjacent minerals and increasing the bond loss of the foliation plane, consequently \n\ncausing instability of the rock blocks in tropical conditions. It is expected that this study \n\ncan aid in the textural and micromorphological classification of minerals undergoing \n\nweathering in general, as well as in the study of the modifications of the gneissic \n\ncrystalline fabric caused by such a process in engineering geology applications. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n95 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1 - Micromorphological and textural description of weathered minerals based on the shape and volume of the alteromorphs (Modified  from Delvigne 1998). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n96 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5.2 Geological and weathering conditions \n\n \n\nThe geological setting of the region where the Monte Seco Tunnel was excavated is the \n\nNova Ven\u00e9cia Complex, located in the Para\u00edba do Sul Domain of the Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed Orogenic Belt of \n\nMantiqueira Province. The rock analyzed in this study is a migmatitic sillimanite-garnet-\n\ncordierite-biotite gneiss (Baltazar et al. 2010), herein referred to as gneiss. \n\nClimatic conditions control the intensity of weathering mechanisms such as \n\ndisaggregation and decomposition of the rock, which are basically influenced by temperature \n\nand rainfall. In the study area, the rainfall varies from 100 to 120 cm in the summer and from \n\n50 to 20 cm in the winter, and the temperature varies from 28 to 26 \u00b0C in the summer and 22 to \n\n20 \u00b0C in the winter. According to Dearman et al. (1978), the climate is tropical with clear \n\ncontrasts between the dry and rainy seasons, characterizing a physical-chemical weathering of \n\nmoderate intensity, varying from strong to very weak. \n\nThe geological and environmental conditions led to the modeling of a relief composed of \n\nhills and slopes with pronounced declivity: the outcropping rock has a sugarloaf shape. \n\nUnderground investigations via geoelectrical profiles and rotatory drillings were conducted and \n\nused to determine the geological profile. The local weathering profile was created by a \n\ncontinuous geomorphologic evolution and therefore is compared to the slope weathering profile \n\nof Deere and Patton (1971); the profile is constituted by three weathering horizons (Figure 5.2): \n\nI \u2013 transported Soil, II \u2013 very to moderately weathered rock mass, and III \u2013 weakly weathered \n\nrock mass. Horizon I contains soil and rock blocks of various sizes, which are in part very \n\nweathered. \n\nAbrupt or weakly evolved contacts between the weathering horizons are common in \n\nslopes developed in gneissic regions, especially in Southeastern Brazil, where the study area is \n\nlocated (Barroso et al. 1996, Pimentel and Barroso 1996, Marques et al. 2010). \n\n\n\n97 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2 - Weathering profile adopted to study the Monte Seco Tunnel rock mass \n\n \n\n \n\n5.2 Materials and methods  \n\n \n\nThe gneissic rock samples were carefully collected from drilling cores and outcropping \n\nrock blocks in the vicinity of the Monte Seco Tunnel to represent all three weathering horizons \n\n(Figure 5.2). The weathering grades of the samples were characterized by visual and tactile \n\nprocedures according to the descriptions presented in Table 5.1. \n\nDue to their fragility, samples representing grades W2 and W3 were impregnated with an \n\nepoxy resin inside a vacuum heater; then, thin sections were carefully prepared from those \n\nsamples at the Geoscience Institute of S\u00e3o Paulo University (IGc-USP). This procedure helped \n\nmaintain the sample in a more compact form, preserving textural and micromorphological \n\nfeatures that could be disturbed during preparation of the sections. The petrographic analyses \n\nwere conducted with the Leica Zeiss Axioplan optical microscope of the Laboratory of \n\nSedimentology of the IGc. The images were captured using the Leica Application Suite (LAS) \n\nV4.7 software. Duplicate samples were submitted to for X-ray diffraction testing to characterize \n\nthe weathering products not usually identifiable in petrographic analyses. These two sets of \n\ntests were conducted separately at the IGc and the Engineering School of the University of S\u00e3o \n\nPaulo (EPUSP) laboratories. The weathering grade characterization and the additional work \n\ncarried out on the thin sections are described in Table 5.2. \n\nThe initial procedure was to characterize the dominant weathering processes acting to \n\ntransform the primary mineralogy into secondary minerals and the type of secondary \n\n\n\n98 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nmineralogy produced. The information obtained helped in the identification, characterization \n\nand classification of the microsystems, the mineral weathering pattern and the textural and \n\nmicromorphological aspects of the weathered minerals. The gneissic rock-forming minerals \n\nand their alteromorphs were described in terms of the weathering grades according to Delvigne \n\n(1998). Additionally, the cordierite alteromorphs were characterized by intramineral \n\nweathering petrographic indexes, the extent of weathering index (Ea) and the intramineral \n\nmicrofissure index (If), which were used to quantify the disaggregation and decomposition \n\nprocesses. The methodology applied in this study and the literature consulted to characterize \n\nthe weathering process are summarized in the flowchart shown in Figure 5.3. \n\nIn the additional step, the cordierite alteromorphs were first identified and compared to \n\nthe weathering stages of the Delvigne (1998) classification. Approximately sixty alteromorphs \n\nwere sampled for the analyses. The Ea index of an alteromorph, expressed as a percentage, is \n\nthe relationship between the area occupied by the secondary products and the total area of the \n\noriginal cordierite. The If index, expressed in fissures per millimeter (f/mm), is the number of \n\nfissures of any type (intra- to transmineral), counted on a scanline drawn inside the alteromorph. \n\nThe scanline was drawn perpendicular to the most pronounced orientation of the observed \n\nfissures. The measurement and treatment of data were performed using ImageJ software. The \n\nimage treatment consisted of transforming the photomicrograph (taken with crossed nicols) and \n\nextracting the background using the software tool extract background. By applying this tool, \n\nthe fissures and the relief of the unweathered mineral are enhanced, whereas the weathered \n\nportion is not. This additional step is described in detail in the flowchart shown in Figure 5.4. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n99 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\nTable 5.1 - Intact rock weathering grades (Modified after Hoek and Brown, 1997; BS 5930, \n\n1999, ISRM, 2015) \n\nGrades Visual Tactile Features \nUCS by simple \n\nmeans (MPa) \n\nW\n1\n (\n\nI \n- \n\nII\n) \n\nFresh to incipient weathered. \n\nMacroscopically there is no evidence \n\nof weathering of minerals.

Sillimanite and other minerals, including \n\nopaque minerals, are subordinate. Figure 5.5 shows the most representative photomicrographs \n\nfor the textural and micromorphological characterization and classification developed for the \n\nmineralogical assemblage of the gneissic rock. Figure 5.6 shows an example of the X-ray \n\ndiffraction test result (sample n\u00b05) used to identify the final weathering product. The dominant \n\nweathering processes acting to transform the primary minerals to secondary minerals are \n\n\n\n102 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\npresented in Figure 5.7. The classification of the microsystems, weathering patterns and textural \n\nmodifications of the alteromorphs are organized schematically in Figure 5.8. \n\nThe quartz, resistant to decomposition, suffers preferential disaggregation processes due \n\nto the occurrence of intra- to transmineral fissures in the microsystems formed with the biotite \n\nand the cordierite alteromorphs (Figures 5.5 G and 5.7). \n\nThe feldspars (orthoclase and plagioclase - andesine), felsic minerals, undergo a partial \n\nhydrolysis process with various intermediate minerals throughout their weathering stages, 0 to \n\n3 and 0 to 4, respectively. The mineralogical transformation of these alteromorphs is triggered \n\nby sericitization with the formation of sericite (illite), kaolinite and gibbsite.  \n\nThe weathering in the orthoclase begins from the edges and cleavages, following a regular \n\npattern, whereas in the plagioclase, it starts from the irregular intramineral fissures, following \n\nan irregular pattern, speckled and patchy. These alteromorphs present secondary products with \n\nlow crystallinity and cavernous residues, with primary mineral nuclei fissuring. These minerals \n\npresent a textural modification characterized by iso-alteromorphs and halo-alteromorphs and \n\ncontribute to an intramineral secondary porosity, which is linked to the secondary mineral \n\nporosity, and fissural porosity, related to the opening of cleavage planes in the orthoclase \n\n(Figures 5.5 B - C, 5.7 and 5.8). \n\nCordierite and biotite, intermediate mafic minerals, also undergo a partial hydrolysis \n\nprocess, producing various intermediate minerals throughout their weathering stages, 0 to 4 and \n\n0 to 3, respectively. The mineralogical transformation is triggered by pinitization followed by \n\nchloritization in the cordierite and chloritization in the biotite, with the formation of pinite, \n\nchlorite, sericite (illite), smectite, kaolinite, gibbsite and goethite. The weathering in the \n\ncordierite starts from the borders and intramineral fissures in a regular banded pelicular pattern.  \n\nThe weathering in the biotite starts from the cleavages, opening them in a regular linear \n\nparallel pattern. These alteromorphs present secondary products, such as chlorite and smectite, \n\nthat influence the intramineral fissuring process of these alteromorphs as well as of the adjacent \n\nminerals, forming the microsystems of the gneissic rock matrix. Through weathering stages 1 \n\nto 2, due to crystallization of these secondary products, the modification of the volume of the \n\ncordierite and biotite alteromorphs is noticeable in at least one crystallographic direction. These \n\nminerals present a textural modification characterized by meso-alteromorphs and halo-\n\nalteromorphs and contribute to a secondary intramineral porosity, linked to the secondary \n\n\n\n103 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nproducts formed, and fissural porosity, clearly related to the development of fissures and the \n\ncoalescence of intra- and intermineral fissures, forming transmineral fissures (Figures 5.5 F-G, \n\n5.5 D-E, 5.7 and 5.8). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.5 - Photomicrographs of the mineral weathering stages and weathering process in fissured quartz (Qz), \n\northoclase (Fk) and plagioclase (Pl) (A \u2013 C). Biotite (Bt) undergoing incipient weathering, producing goethite \n\n(Gth) along some cleavages (D) and interlayered chlorite (Chl) and probably smectite in an advanced weathering \n\nstage (E). Cordierite (Cr) undergoing weathering, producing pinite (Pn) and chlorite with an incipient wedge \n\neffect (G) in an advanced weathering condition or producing interlayered pinite, chlorite and probably smectite, \n\nwith sericite (Sr) with an extreme wedge effect (F).

In the images, (D \u2013 G) depict the fissuring process due to the textural modification of the \n\nbiotite and cordierite alteromorphs. The voids are represented by the letter V, while the mineral weathering \n\nstages (0 \u2013 4) are denoted inside the brackets. \n\n \n\nHypersthene and garnet, mafic minerals with a small amount of silicon in their \n\ncomposition, tend to undergo a very intense alteration process of total hydrolysis plus oxidation \n\ndespite their completely different alterabilities. Hypersthene weathers up to stage 4 in slightly \n\n\n\n104 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nto moderately weathered samples, whereas the garnet weathers to stage 3 in completely \n\nweathered samples. The weathering of these minerals generates large amounts of goethite; in \n\nparticular, weathering of the garnet generates abundant gibbsite.  \n\nThe weathering in the hypersthene starts from the edges and cleavages in a regular, \n\npelicular to linear pattern. The weathering in the garnet starts from the borders and intramineral \n\nfissures in an irregular, crossed and linear pattern. These alteromorphs present residual primary \n\nmineral nuclei that are fissured and in contact with intramineral voids in a skeleton formed by \n\ngoethite. These minerals present a textural modification characterized by iso-alteromorphs and \n\nporo-alteromorphs, specifically septo-poro-alteromorphs, and contribute to secondary porosity \n\nrelated to intramineral pores and fissures (Figures 5.5 H-I, 5.7 and 5.8). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.6 - Illustration of a X-ray diffraction test showing some of the final weathering products, in this case, \n\nsmectite, illite and kaolinite. \n\n \n\nThe mafic minerals, when weathered, release Fe2+ ions, which, due to their low mobility, \n\nsoon oxidize and precipitate in the form of goethite, iron oxide and hydroxide, usually filling \n\nand cementing the intra-, inter- and transmineral fissures, generally increasing the iron content \n\nin the rock matrix.

The evolution of cordierite \n\nweathering is summarized in Table 5.3 in terms of its textural and micromorphological \n\nfeatures, evolutionary stages, and petrographic index averages and intervals. \n\nCordierite is present in the contact microsystem formed by quartz, orthoclase, \n\nplagioclase, biotite and garnet and opaque minerals (Ot), overlain by another microsystem \n\ncomposed of intramineral fissures related to twinning planes in cordierite and \n\ntransmineral fissures linked to the fracturing of the rock mass. This arrangement is \n\nconsidered the initial stage (stage 0) of the textural and micromorphological evolution of \n\nthe cordierite located in the parental microsystem marked by lepido-granoblastic texture \n\n(Figure 5.9 \u2013 stage 0). The minerals identified in stage 0 contain 2.7 intramineral f/mm \n\nand are practically unweathered (Ea = 0.82%), composing the gneiss parental \n\nmicrosystem. The microfissuring connects the weathering agents with the mineral, \n\ntriggering pinitization in the alteromorph (Figure 5.9 and Table 5.3). \n\nIn stage 1 (Figure 5.9 \u2013 stage 1), alteroplasmation (a type of pinitization) starts at \n\nthe mineral rims and penetrates through fissures inward, consequently increasing the If \n\nand Ea values of the alteromorph. Alteroplasmation is regular at the rims and along the \n\nfissures of the mineral, forming pinite, which is an isotropic material under polarized \n\nlight. Twinning planes, when present, and intramineral to transmineral fissures are \n\npreferential areas for mineral weathering.  \n\nThe weathering pattern is characteristically regular, pelicular combined with linear, \n\nthe resultant alteroplasm or iso-alteromorph being formed by primary cordierite and \n\npinite, with a well-defined geometry and shape. Pores were not observed in this \n\nmicrosystem. The 10 to 4 f/mm interval is determines the alteromorph textural evolution \n\nas well as the gradual increase in index Ea along the subsequent stages (Figure 5.9 and \n\nTable 5.3). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n109 \n\n \n\n \n\n109 \n\n \n\nTable 5.3 - Evolutionary stages of the cordierite alteromorphs. \n\n \n\n \n\nIn stage 2 (Figure 5.9 \u2013 stage 2), pinitization evolves and develops a kind of banding \n\nin the secondary minerals with the accumulation of iron oxides and hydroxides (possibly \n\ngoethite) in the weathered minerals. In addition, the number of intramineral fissures in \n\nthe alteromorph increases. Banding occurs with a fine pinite layer at the weathering front, \n\naccompanied by a crystallized portion of chlorite. Banding occurs both at the mineral \n\nrims and in the most expressive fissures. Pinitization evolves from the initial stages of \n\ncordierite weathering, forming chlorite, smectite and kaolinite. Sericite is a potassic \n\nmineral identified in the most weathered portions of the alteromorph, which are usually \n\nlinked by transmineral fissures to the rock microsystem, where orthoclase and biotite are \n\nbeing decomposed. \n\n \n\n\n\n110 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.9 - Photomicrographs of the cordierite evolution stages (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4) with respect to the \n\npetrographic intramineral weathering indexes. \n\n \n\nThe intramineral fissures are oriented in two directions. The fissures in the most \n\nprominent orientation are filled with evolved minerals, such as chlorite and goethite; the \n\nsecondary direction developed later, and the corresponding fissures may not be filled or \n\nfilled only with pinite. The minerals in contact with the cordierite alteromorphs present \n\nintramineral fissures filled with secondary minerals that are oriented perpendicularly to \n\nthe contact between these phases, roughly radially around the alteromorph. The analysis \n\nof the fissures indicates a change in size in one or more directions, which is corroborated \n\nby the secondary products, characterizing the meso-alteromorphic texture. When goethite \n\nforms past the cordierite rims and fills the fissures of adjacent minerals, the newly formed \n\ntexture is echino(meso)-alteromorphic. However, in stage 2, the cordierite alteromorphs \n\nare found in a parental microsystem of superimposed fissural and plasmic microsystems. \n\nThe If values present a subtle increase, while a gradual increase in Ea to values less than \n\n50% are observed, i.e., a greater proportion of primary mineral (Figure 5.9 and Table 5.3). \n\nIn stage 3 (Figure 5.9 \u2013 stage 3), pinitization and chloritization are almost complete, \n\nisolating irregular, residual nuclei of the primary mineral inside the secondary plasma. \n\nPinite and, specifically, chlorite are well crystallized, constituting the main secondary \n\nminerals of the alteromorph. Pinite is restricted to the weathering fronts and intramineral \n\nfissures, which propagate through primary mineral nuclei to the rims. Goethite mostly \n\nfills the fissures. \n\n\n\n111 \n\n \n\n \n\n111 \n\n \n\nIn stage 4 (Figure 5.9 \u2013 stage 4), pinitization and chloritization are complete in the \n\nalteromorph. Cordierite is completely weathered and is disaggregated, decomposed, and \n\nreplaced by secondary products (pinite, chlorite, sericite, smectite and goethite). The \n\nprimary mineral nuclei are now distinguished only by the differences in crystallinity \n\namong the constituting plasma. Mineral weathering makes both the visualization of the \n\nintramineral fissures and the quantification of If difficult. The alteromorph still preserves \n\nits original volume, despite being modified in shape. Under the microscope, no pores \n\nwere identified in cordierite alteromorphs when they were completely replaced by \n\nsecondary products, characterizing the final texture as holo-alteromorphic. \n\nIn stages 3 and 4, a great variation in the number of intramineral fissures, between \n\n7.9 and 19.2 f/mm, is observed; these fissures superimpose those observed in stages 2 and \n\n1. Nevertheless, a lower limit of approximately 10 f/mm can be established for textural \n\nevolution in these stages. In stages 3 and 4, the alteromorphs formed by secondary \n\nproducts are in a larger proportion than those from the primary mineral; the calculated Ea \n\nexceeded 68% and increases up to 100%, characterizing the holo-alteromorphic texture \n\n(Figure 5.9 and Table 5.3). \n\n \n\n5.4.3 Petrographic aspects and weathering grade characterization \n\n \n\nThe main petrographic information regarding the textural and micromorphological \n\nmodifications was gathered in Table 5.4 according to the weathering grades previously \n\ncharacterized. Table 5.4 also includes photomicrographs that illustrate the cordierite \n\nweathering evolution of the gneissic foliation microsystem. \n\nIn the fresh to slightly weathering grades, W1, the gneissic rock matrix is formed \n\nby a lepido-granoblastic texture with incipient intramineral fissures, and the cordierite \n\nand plagioclase show incipient weathering. In the moderately weathering grade, W2, the \n\nweathering continues to the sericitization of the feldspars, orthoclase and plagioclase, and \n\nthe pinitization and chloritization of cordierite and biotite alteromorphs. \n\nThe quartz appears to be fissured by formation of the secondary minerals produced \n\nby the cordierite and biotite alteromorph rims. The contact microsystem of the lepido-\n\n\n\n112 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ngranoblastic texture starts to be superimposed by fissural and plasmic microsystems. The \n\ncordierite alteromorphs begin to have a decisive impact because they increase \n\nintramineral fissuring, forming transminerals along the foliation plane. In the highly to \n\ncompletely weathering grade, W3, the rock matrix is completely modified due to \n\nweathering of the whole primary minerals in different development stages. Cordierite and \n\nplagioclase alteromorphs were found to be completely weathered to secondary minerals \n\npresenting meso(holo)- and holo-alteromorphic textures, while orthoclase and biotite \n\nalteromorphs showed partial development, showing iso- and meso-alteromorphic \n\ntextures, respectively. The initial contact microsystem of the lepido-granoblastic texture \n\nis not easily recognized due to the superimposition of the fissural and plasmic \n\nmicrosystems, which now dominate the rock matrix. \n\nAmong the alteromorph textural modifications that occur with the progression of \n\nthe mineral weathering stages, the main aspects controlling the degradation of the rock \n\nmatrix are associated with the following stages: i) 3 and 4 for the orthoclase and \n\nplagioclase that are related to the isolation of nuclei of the fissured and cavernous primary \n\nminerals enveloped by secondary products (Figures 5.5 B-C and 5.8) that define \n\nweathering grade W3 (Table 5.4); ii) 2 to 4 for the cordierite and biotite that are related \n\nto the occurrence of fissures in the adjacent minerals and in the alteromorphs and to the \n\ntextural modification classified as meso-alteromorphs (Figures 5.5 D-G and 5.8), which \n\nare observed in weathering grades W2 and W3, respectively (Table 5.4); and iii) 2 to 4 \n\nfor the hypersthene and garnet that are related to the occurrence of intramineral pores, \n\nisolating cemented nuclei from the primary mineral via fissures (Figures 5.5 H-I and 5.8), \n\nconsidered due to the low mineral volumes of the petrographic analyses. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n113 \n\n \n\n \n\n113 \n\n \n\n Table 5.4 - Petrographic aspects of the weathering grades. \n\n \n\n\n\n114 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5.5 Discussion and conclusion \n\n \n\nThe present research focused on a gneissic massif excavated for the construction of \n\nan unlined tunnel, which remained exposed to weathering for more than 50 years. The \n\nresulting block instability has affected the logistics of the iron ore railway transport. This \n\nresearch was based on mineral textural and micromorphological characterization and \n\ncontributes to the understanding of the weathering and degradation stages that modified \n\nthe mechanical properties of the gneissic rock. \n\nThe edge effect of the biotite alteromorphs that formed in the rock matrix \n\ndeterioration and arenization processes, due to the meso-alteromorphic texture, were well \n\ndocumented in the literature to be one of the fabric modifications responsible for strength \n\nloss of gneissic rock, as observed in Le Pera et al. (2001) and Regmi et al. (2014), as well \n\nas for the granite rocks (Irfan and Dearman, 1978). However, the cordierite weathering \n\nbehavior of some gneissic lithotypes seems to be relevant but still not fully considered \n\nproperly. Marques et al. (2010) described weathering in Kinzigite, relating the oxidation \n\nand formation of iron oxides and hydroxides. In their work, the minerals pinite, chlorite, \n\nsericite and smectite were not considered or described as secondary products, which are \n\npart of the mineralogy observed in the Nova Ven\u00e9cia gneissic rocks studied here. \n\nIn the foliation plane, under weathering of the gneissic rock studied, the \n\nmicrosystem formed of biotite and cordierite alteromorphs produced secondary minerals, \n\nsuch as chlorite and smectite, that contributed to the increase in fissuring, triggering \n\nweathering of the whole mineral; this weathering caused deep changes in the mineral \n\nbond, consequently decreasing the rock strength. The Monte Seco Tunnel was excavated \n\nin a gneissic rock mass that is in a tropical climate marked by wetting and drying cycles, \n\nwhich intensifies this type of weathering and rock matrix fragility, undoubtably \n\ncontributing to rock block instability problems. \n\nCordierite distributed in the rock mass (intact rock) and concentrated along the \n\nfoliation planes is destroyed by pinitization, chloritization and replaced by pinite, chlorite, \n\nsericite, smectite, kaolinite and goethite along cleavage planes, intramineral fissures and \n\nthe alteromorph rims. The corresponding weathering pattern is characterized by the \n\ngeneration of secondary crystalline products that interfere in the intramineral fissuring of \n\nthe adjacent minerals that form the rock microsystem, leading to a textural change \n\n\n\n115 \n\n \n\n \n\n115 \n\n \n\ncharacterized by meso-alteromorphs and halo-alteromorphs. \n\nThe presence of the meso-alteromorphic texture in the cordierite and biotite \n\ncharacterize weathering grades W2 and W3, respectively. These weathered minerals \n\ncontribute to the generation of a secondary fissural porosity, and the resulting textural \n\nchange reflects the fragility mechanism of the crystalline fabric or the lepido-granoblastic \n\ntexture. The tropical environment intensifies the effects of this type of fragility because \n\nwetting and drying cycles allow the secondary materials that fill the fissures to leach or \n\nexpand and contract, further loosening the bonds between the minerals and compromising \n\ncohesion. \n\nThis analysis is fundamental to the understanding of the role played by the gneissic \n\nfoliation in the instability of the blocks in a tunnel with no lining. Foliation is known to \n\nbe a plane of minimal strength or traction, characterizing surfaces that favor the separation \n\nof blocks from the rock mass. When the minerals present in the foliation, such as biotite \n\nand cordierite, undergo weathering, they promote fissuring of the crystalline fabric and \n\nthe subsequent loosening of the mineral bonds. Thus, biotite and cordierite textural \n\nmodifications have a decisive influence on the loss of mechanical strength of wet rock, \n\nwhich deserves proper attention because of its relevance for determining the maintenance \n\nfor and lifetime of the Monte Seco Tunnel. \n\n \n\n5.6 References \n\n \n\nAREL E, TUGRUL A. 2001.

THE INFLUENCE OF WEATHERING GRADES ON GNEISSIC ROCK4  \n\n \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nThis paper presents the influence of weathering grade on gneissic rock behaviour under \n\ntropical climatic conditions. The studied rock mass, through which a tunnel was \n\nexcavated, was not reinforced by lining during tunnel construction and thus has been \n\nexposed to weathering for more than fifty years. This rock mass is starting to present \n\nproblems related to block instability, motivating the re-evaluation of the geotechnical \n\nproperties of the rock mass (intact rock). The physical properties (density and porosity), \n\nrebound number (RL), compressional wave velocity (Vp), uniaxial compressive strength \n\n(UCS), indirect tensile strength (ITS) and tangent elastic modulus (E) were correlated \n\nwith the micropetrographic index (Ip), physical weathering degree (PWD), and strength \n\nratio (RS) for weathering grade characterization. The analyses indicated that mineral \n\nfragility influences the mechanical behaviour. A strength degradation relationship that is \n\na function of weathering was suggested. A quantitative weathering grade was presented, \n\nwhich is important for tunnel maintenance, future engineering interventions and regional \n\nrock formation studies. Data from relevant literature were used to propose the normalized \n\ngeneral degradation strength for gneissic rock and other rocks with the same \n\nmineralogical composition. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Gneissic rock, Weathering grades, Strength degradation, Tunnel \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n4 Authors: Monticelli J.P., Futai M. M. \n\n\n\n120 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nThe Monte Seco Tunnel (Esp\u00edrito Santo State, Brazil) is a segment of the Vit\u00f3ria-\n\nMinas Railway (VMR) and was excavated in a gneissic rock mass; additionally, this \n\ntunnel has lining only at the entrance and exit. Since this tunnel was constructed in the \n\n1950s, it has experienced a degradation of its initial mechanical characteristics due to the \n\nlong-term exposure of the rock to weathering, resulting in rock falls from the ceiling and \n\nwalls. VMR is responsible for the transport of iron ore from the Quadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero \n\n(Iron Quadrangle), in the state of Minas Gerais, to the Vit\u00f3ria ports, in the state of Esp\u00edrito \n\nSanto, and its full operation is fundamental because ore supply interruption can cause \n\nlogistical issues. Detailed assessment of the present geologic-geotechnical conditions of \n\nthe Monte Seco Tunnel has indicated the risks associated with rock instability, \n\nconstituting a fundamental part of several studies from GeoInfraUSP \u2013 EPUSP (Cacciari \n\nand Futai, 2016, 2017; Monticelli et al., 2019a,b). \n\nA commonly studied subject is the rock weathering grade characterization and its \n\nrelation to gneissic behaviour; however, the proposed classifications are usually \n\nqualitative graded from lowest to highest grade (hence, from highest to lowest mechanical \n\nstrength), considering three to five grades (fresh, slightly weathered, moderately \n\nweathered, and highly weathered, for example) and based on weathering profiles and \n\nvisual-tactile assessment of the intact rock (Deere and Patton, 1971 and  ISRM, 2015). \n\nWeathering grades have been correlated with the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of \n\nrock (BS 5930, 1999; Hoek and Brown, 1997), thus assigning quantitative values. \n\nHowever, each rock type should be appropriately studied, and the classification of \n\nweathering grades should be based on existing experience and correct interpretation of \n\nlocal conditions and field and laboratory test results, appropriate to the level of the \n\nresearch project. \n\nThe focus of this study was the weathering grade characterization of a gneissic rock \n\nby the application of petrographic and physical-mechanical weathering indexes. The \n\ngneissic rock matrix was previously classified in terms of its petrographic facies in \n\naccordance with mineralogical properties and by means of tactile and visual weathering \n\ngrade characterization. After classification, the samples were submitted to petrographic \n\nand physical-mechanical tests. The physical properties (density and porosity), rebound \n\n\n\n121 \n\n \n\n \n\n121 \n\n \n\nnumber (RL), compressional wave velocity (Vp), UCS, indirect tensile strength (ITS) and \n\ntangent elastic modulus (E) were correlated with the micropetrographic index (Ip) of Irfan \n\nand Dearman (1978), the physical weathering degree (PWD) of Esaki and Jian (1999), \n\nthe coefficient of weathering (IVp) of Illiev (1966) and the unsound constituent (UC) and \n\nstrength ratio (RS) indexes of Gupta and Rao (2001). \n\nThe petrographic and the engineering weathering indexes could distinguish the \n\ngneissic petrographic facies behaviours; the results indicated that one of the facies \n\nexhibits a more moderate weathering grade than those of the other facies. The \n\nheterogeneity of the gneissic rock mass along the tunnel length may have allowed the \n\ngeomechanical properties to be overestimated in previous investigations. \n\nThe analysis of these conditions and the results of the tests led to the proposition of \n\na curve of the degradation of strength and stiffness related to the weathering of gneissic \n\nrock. The quantitative weathering information obtained in this research is fundamental \n\nfor Monte Seco Tunnel maintenance, future engineering interventions and other \n\napplications related to the effect of weathering on the geomechanical behaviour of rock \n\nmasses with the same lithology. \n\n \n\n6.2 Background \n\n \n\nPetrographic weathering indexes are used to qualify and quantify the intensity and \n\nthe evolution of the decomposition and disintegration processes that affect the minerals \n\nthat form the rock matrix. Engineering indexes are used to express the physical-\n\nmechanical property degradation along a continuous scale or range along the weathering \n\ngrade scale, and if possible, define its limits. \n\nAmong the most widely used petrographic indexes is the Ip of Irfan and Dearman \n\n(1978). Ip relates the number of sound minerals (SM) to the UCs (unsound or weathered \n\nminerals, UMs; fissures, Fs; and pores, Vs) and characterizes both the decomposition and \n\nthe disaggregation processes of the minerals according to Eq. 1. \n\n \n\n?? (??) =\n??\n\n??\n=  \n\n??\n\n??+?+?\n=  \n\n?? (%)\n\n??+??+??+??+? (%)\n                                                (1) \n\n\n\n122 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe PWD was defined by Esaki and Jian (1999); it relates the secondary porosity \n\nof a weathered sample to the total secondary porosity of the rock acquired after \n\nweathering and could provide additional information in rock characterization. However, \n\nthe PWD application requires knowledge of the variation in porosity (?) along the \n\nweathering profile. The PWD is calculated according to Eq. 2, where ?f represents the \n\nfresh rock, ?w is the weathered rock and ?u represents the ultimate weathering product, \n\nusually the complete or the extreme weathering grade. \n\n \n\n??? (%) = (\n??? ?? \n\n??? ?? \n) 100                                                     (2) \n\n \n\nThe index usually used to quantify weathering aspects is the coefficient of \n\nweathering (IVp) proposed by Iliev (1966); this index quantifies the Vp loss in the \n\nweathered rock and is calculated according to Eq. 3, where Vpf represents the fresh rock \n\nand Vpw represents the weathered rock. The index is multiplied by 100 to obtain its value \n\nas a percentage. The author suggested an IVp value of approximately 0% for weathering \n\ngrade I, between 0-20% for grade II, 20-40% for grade III, 40-60% for grade IV and 60-\n\n100% for grade V. Weathering grades I-V are comparable to those of the ISRM (2015) \n\nclassification. \n\n \n\n??? (%) = (\n???? ??? \n\n??? \n) 100                                                   (3) \n\n \n\nAmong the mechanical weathering indexes, the strength ratio (RS) was introduced \n\nby Gupta and Rao (2001) to characterize and quantify weathering grades with a rapid \n\nassessment of the effects of mechanical degradation. Although this index did not develop \n\nthrough research in gneissic lithotypes, the authors demonstrated that the index (RS) is a \n\nuseful tool in the assessment of the variation in elastic modulus due to the weathering of \n\nquartzite, basalt and granite. In addition, IVp could be used to estimate the UCS in RS \n\ncalculations. RS relates the UCS of the rock in weathering states (UCSw) with the fresh \n\nrock (UCSf), and it is calculated according to Eq. 4. \n\n \n\n??

The \n\nsamples were collected from the same rock mass in the Monte Seco Tunnel and included \n\nall weathering grades. \n\nThe rainfall varies from 100 to 120 cm in the summer and from 50 to 20 cm in the \n\nwinter, and the temperature varies from 28 to 26 \u00b0C in the summer and from 22 to 20 \u00b0C \n\nin the winter. Dearman et al. (1978) define this climate condition as tropical because there \n\nare dry and rainy seasons. In tropical conditions, such as the climate of the studied area, \n\nthe physical-chemical weathering intensity varies from moderate to very slight and \n\ncontrols the disaggregation and decomposition of rock. \n\nThe characterization of the gneissic rock was carried out by means of tactile-visual \n\ninspection and petrography. The fresh gneissic rock of the study area is light grey to bluish \n\ndark-grey and predominantly fine- to medium-grained with a secondary coarse-grained \n\ntexture. Centimetre- to metre-sized bands that correspond to the mesosome are \n\ncharacterized by a lepidogranoblastic texture and a biotite-rich gneiss foliation, \n\ninterspersed with millimetre-sized light (felsic) and centimetre-sized quartz-feldspathic \n\nlenses. Well-formed bands of granoblastic texture correspond to the medium- to coarse-\n\ngrained leucosome composed of feldspar, quartz, cordierite, garnet and opaque minerals. \n\nThe presence of these features, which are closely related to the metamorphism of a \n\nsedimentary prototype, leads to the heterogeneity of the rock matrix. \n\nThis gneissic banding was classified into petrographic facies B1, B2 and B3, \n\naccording to mineral composition, structure, texture and grain size (Table 6.1). The \n\nsamples were carefully collected from drilling cores and outcropping rock blocks in the \n\nvicinity of the southern part of the Monte Seco Tunnel to represent the three alteration \n\nhorizons of the rock mass. The weathering grades of the samples were characterized \n\naccording to the proposal presented in Table 6.2, which was based on the Hoek and Brown \n\n(1997), the BS 5930 (1999), and the ISRM (2015) weathering classifications. To consider \n\nthe abrupt weathering changes observed in field investigations (Monticelli et al. 2019a) \n\nand the rock heterogeneity, the fresh grade (I) and slightly weathered grade (II) were \n\n\n\n124 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ngrouped into grade W1, while the highly weathered grade (IV) and completely weathered \n\ngrade (V) were grouped into grade W3. The moderately weathered grade (III) was \n\nmaintained in W2. In this proposal, the W1 and W3 grades could be distinguished, by \n\ntheir tactile features, through the results of laboratory tests. \n\nPetrographic analysis and physical-mechanical testing (physical property testing, \n\nrebound hardness testing, ultrasonic, in their tactile features, UCS and ITS analysis) were \n\ncarried out at the laboratories of the Institute of Geosciences (IGc), EPUSP and the \n\nEngineering School of S\u00e3o Carlos at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo. The textural and \n\nmicromorphological characterization of the rock-forming minerals was presented in \n\nMonticeli et al. (2019b). The mineral composition, structure, texture and grain size of the \n\nrock were described, as well as an accurate description of the grades and types of \n\nweathering and mineral cracking. \n\nThe Ip ratio was modified in Eq. 5 to capture the development of fissures and the \n\ncoalescence of intramineral fissures in the formation of transmineral fissures due to the \n\nmineral fragility of the cordierite and biotite alteromorphs (Figure 6.1, blue boxes), which \n\nare determinant for the rock matrix modifications. Figure 6.1 illustrates the criteria used \n\nto calculate the modified micropetrographic index (Ip mod) of the gneissic rock of the \n\nMonte Seco Tunnel based on the Delvigne (1998) standardized classification of \n\nweathered minerals. \n\n \n\n?? ??? =   \n?? ??,??(0?2 ??????)+ ?? ??,??

The point counting was performed using the JMicroVision software following a \n\nrandom mesh in representative microsites of the thin sections, analysed under the Leica \n\nZeiss Axioplan optical microscope. The counting ended when the proportions became \n\nconstant at 200 points. Approximately 12 microsites were investigated in each thin \n\nsection, totalling 2400 points analysed in this way.

The angle \n\n(?) between the foliation and load direction for weathering grades W1, W2 and W3 was \n\napproximately 60\u00b0, 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, respectively. The ITS testing of 44 dry samples was \n\ncarried out by using the EMIC test equipment with curved loading jaws, following the \n\nprocedures recommended by the ASTM D 3967-08 (2008) guidelines. The angle (?) \n\nbetween the foliation and load direction was either 0\u00b0 (parallel) or 90\u00b0 (perpendicular). \n\nIn the sclerometry test, a Proceq, type L (0.735 Nm), digital Silver Schmidt \n\nhammer, which has a system for rebound correction in relation to the orientation of the \n\ndevice application, which is the main advantage of this sclerometer over other hammers, \n\nwas used in the rock weathering characterization. Ample debate on the method to obtain \n\nthe rebound number is observed in the literature; single or continuous impacts are usually \n\nperformed (Hucka, 1965; Poole and Farmer, 1980; ASTM D5983-00, 2001; Kahraman et \n\nal., 2002; Aydin and Basu, 2005; Buyuksagis and Goktan, 2007; Aydin, 2009). In this \n\nwork, the methodology of ASTM (2001) was used, which proposes 10 single impacts \n\nseparated by at least the diameter of the sclerometer point and collected away from the \n\nsample edges to avoid effects. \n\nFollowing the guidelines of Aydin (2014), the compressional wave velocity test \n\nwas carried out on the cylindrical specimens using the Pundit Lab+ equipment from \n\nProceq, positioned in a direct transmission manner with transducers of 250 kHz, where \n\nthe average of five measurements was recorded for weathering characterization. After the \n\nlaboratory tests, the physical-mechanical weathering indexes were calculated with Eqs. 2 \n\nto 4. Based on the RS index proposed by Gupta and Rao (2001) (Eq. 4), the indirect tensile \n\nstrength ratio (RITS) and compression elastic modulus ratio (RE) were calculated and \n\nintroduced in the same manner in this study. \n\n\n\n128 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.1 - Illustration of the criterion used for the petrographic weathering index application (modified after Monticelli et al. 2019a).

For these reasons and seeking to adapt and calibrate a weathering \n\ngrade classification (I-V, from fresh to completely weathered) to the gneissic rock matrix \n\nevolution, the most representative photomicrographs of the petrographic facies, their \n\nrespective Ipmod and the previously associated weathering grade (Table 6.2) are shown in \n\nFigure 6.2. \n\nThere is a clear difference between the Ip mod values among the weathering grades \n\nand petrographic facies. Compared to facies B1 and B2, the B3 thin samples previously \n\ncharacterized by grade W1 (Table 6.2) present many intra- to transmineral fissures related \n\nto cordierite and orthoclase alteromorphs, which decreases the fit of the Ip mod values for \n\nthe moderately weathered grade W2 (III) and highly weathered grade (IV) (Figure 6.2, \n\nsample numbers 11-14). On the other hand, the decrease in Ip mod for the petrographic \n\nfacies B1 and B2 is due the development of intra- to transmineral fissures related to the \n\nmeso-alteromorph textural and micromorphological modification presented in the \n\ncordierite and biotite alteromorphs.  \n\nThis textural modification influences the fissuring of the adjacent minerals, \n\nconsequently connecting plasmic microsystems and increasing the whole mineral \n\ndecomposition (Figure 6.2, samples numbers 1-10). These aspects are fundamental to \n\nunderstanding the influence of mineralogical characteristics on the gneissic rock \n\nbehaviour after calibration of the relation among the petrographic facies and weathering \n\nintensity with a continuously decreasing Ip mod. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n130 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.2 - Photomicrographs illustrating the evolution of the fissures in facies B1 (sample numbers 1-5), B2 (sample numbers 6-10) and B3 (sample numbers 11-15) \n\naccording to the Ip mod and the comparison between the initial (Table 6.2) and the general (I-V) weathering grade classifications. The samples numbers 1 to 15 are denoted in \n\nwhite, and the values of Ip mod are denoted in red. Intramineral (Fi), intermineral (Fe) and transmineral (Ft) fissures are indicated. \n\n\n\n131 \n\n \n\n \n\n131 \n\n \n\nNotably, the behaviour observed in facies B3 is influenced by the granulometry \n\n(Table 6.1), which, due to the high quantities of coarse-grained minerals, increases the \n\nmineral embrittlement, resulting in open cleavages in the orthoclase and fissures in the \n\ncordierite alteromorphs. \n\nThe petrographic aspects of the gneissic banding (Table 6.1), which are closely \n\nrelated to the suggested weathering grade rearrangement (Figure 6.2), are also responsible \n\nfor the variation in the physical properties, density and porosity, as presented in Figure \n\n6.3. Facies B1 and B2, rich in mafic minerals with tight intramineral fissures, such as \n\nthose found in biotite, are more dense than facies B3, rich in felsic coarse-grained \n\nminerals with incipient intra- to transmineral fissuring, for the same porosity range in the \n\nlow weathering grades (0.2-2%). Due to the development of secondary porosity related \n\nto the increase in fissuring and mineral decomposition, the variation in density among the \n\npetrographic facies decreases with the porosity, although some B3 densities seem to be \n\noutside the limits of density determined for previously studied gneissic rock. \n\n \n\n2 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3\n\nBulk density, ?

The average values were \n\ncalculated based on Ip mod and RS for general weathering grade classification (I, II, III, IV \n\nand V, from fresh to completely weathered). Basically, facies B3 were grouped into \n\ngrades III, IV and V, unlike facies B1 and B2, due to the petrographic characteristic data \n\n(Figure 6.2), and further considerations will be given for mechanical degradation. In terms \n\nof the major petrographic and physical aspects of the effect of weathering on gneissic \n\nrock, it can be observed that Ip mod density, Vp and RL decrease and porosity increases as \n\nweathering becomes more severe. The resultant significative coefficients of \n\ndetermination support the rearrangement of the gneissic rock weathering grades and the \n\nobserved modifications to the rock matrix. These relationships provide useful and \n\naccessible information to characterize gneissic weathering grades (Figures 6.2 and 6.4), \n\nalthough a preliminary heterogeneity classification may be needed to comprehensively \n\nevaluate the gneissic behaviours.  \n\nRegarding the sclerometry test results, a comparison between the rebound values \n\nobtained on the surfaces of the weathered rock blocks (RLsur) and the average of the \n\nsamples extracted from them (RLint) was performed (Figure 6.5). Under ideal conditions, \n\nthere would be no difference between RLsur and RLint. However, in general, the RLsur values \n\nof the weathered rock blocks were observed to be lower than the RLint values, and this \n\ntrend was observed for a continuous range of known rebound values.  \n\nIn the rock blocks that are more homogenously weathered or exhibit an advanced \n\nweathering condition, e.g., block J, this difference seems to be smaller, but often the \n\nsamples extracted from such rock blocks are broken during the sclerometry test. This \n\nindicates a possible limit in the rebound values of cylindrical samples due to sample \n\nbreaking. On the other hand, in heterogeneously weathered rock blocks, for rock blocks \n\npresenting less advanced weathering conditions with exfoliation weathering, the \n\ndifference is slightly greater, e.g., block H, reflected by the data point plotting farther \n\nfrom the 1:1 line in Figure 6.5.

The comparison of the ITS values obtained \n\nparallel and transverse to foliation in the extreme weathering grades is shown in Figure \n\n6.7. The UCS, ITS and E values were correlated with bulk density and porosity in Figure \n\n6.8 and with RL and Vp in Figure 6.9. Figure 6.10 shows the relationship between E and \n\nITS with UCS along the general weathering grade classification. Unfortunately, it was \n\n\n\n135 \n\n \n\n \n\n135 \n\n \n\nnot possible to characterize E with confidence in the moderately weathering grade \n\nbecause the material became deformable, and it was difficult to fix the local \n\ninstrumentation. Figures 6.6 to 6.10 summarize the geomechanics results and are \n\ndiscussed below. \n\nThe axial and splitting rupture modes were observed in the UCS tests for all the \n\npetrographic facies, but for the material with advanced weathering conditions, one shear \n\nfailure was usually observed in facies B1, while multiple shear failures were observed in \n\nfacies B2 and B3 (Figure 6.6a-c). \n\nThe foliation of the gneissic rock studied weakly influenced the UCS values in \n\nweathering grade W1 (I-II) of facies B1 and B2, as was noticed by one rupture along the \n\nfoliation plane oriented at 60\u00b0, resulting in a UCS of 77 MPa, was disregarded in the \n\nrelationships between the physical and mechanical properties shown below. \n\nDobereiner et al. (1993) noted that the difference between parallel and transverse \n\nUCS values increases with weathering, but Marques et al. (2010) argued that the gneissic \n\nrock becomes more isotropic. The foliation effect was not fully addressed in the UCS \n\ncharacterization; however, the ratio between the transverse and  parallel ITS values of \n\nfacies B1-B2 in the extremes weathering grades indicated an increase in the foliation \n\neffect with weathering (Figure 6.7). \n\nIn general, the ITS is higher in specimens loaded in a direction transverse to \n\nfoliation than those loaded parallel to foliation. However, when the weathering grades \n\nincrease, the effect of anisotropy increase, and the ratios of parallel to transverse ITS \n\nresults can be compared. This ratio is 0.65 for grades I-II and decreases to 0.37 for grades \n\nIV-V. This result indicate that weathering reduces the strength along the foliation planes.  \n\n\n\n136 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.6 -  Photographic record after the UCS and ITS tests for the completely weathering grade of petrographic facies B1 (A), B2 (B) and B3 (C).

The aligned contact microsystem of the \n\nbiotite-cordierite foliation plane in the low weathering grades or the lepidogranoblastic \n\ntexture is superimposed by parallel and transverse transmineral fissuring triggered by the \n\nweathering of these minerals in the advanced weathering grade. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.7 - Comparison between parallel and transverse tensile strength values obtained for the extreme \n\nweathering grades. \n\n \n\nThe difference in the mineralogical conditions among the petrographic facies was \n\neasily recognized in the relationships between the UCS and ITS results and the physical \n\nproperties. The petrographic facies B3 samples presented UCS and ITS maximum values \n\nof approximately 100 MPa and 6 MPa, respectively, while those of the B1-B2 facies were \n\napproximately 160 MPa and 11 MPa (Figure 6.8a-d). For granite, according to Sajid et \n\nal. (2016), the increase in mineral grain size decreases the UCS and ITS strengths in the \n\nless advanced weathering grades. This aspect also influenced the variation in strength \n\nobserved in facies B1-B2 to B3 in the UCS and ITS tests. Facies B3 presents UCS and \n\nITS values that plot roughly in the middle of the mechanical degradation trend in relation \n\nto facies B1-B2 (Figure 6.8a-b). \n\n6.65\n\n10.22\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nT\ne\nn\nsi\n\nle\n s\n\ntr\ne\nn\ng\nth\n\n, \nIT\n\nS\n(M\n\nP\na\n)\n\nI / II \n\nParallel TransversalTransverse\n\n0.96\n\n2.61\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nIV / V\n\n\n\n138 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe mechanical responses of UCS, ITS and E have practically the same tendency \n\n(Figure 6.8); the value increases with bulk density, and the opposite trend is observed \n\nwith porosity. For bulk densities higher than 2.6 g/cm3 or porosities lower than 2%, the \n\nstrength and stiffness of the rock increase rapidly. The fit of the proposed correlation \n\nequation is better with porosity than with bulk density. \n\nIn the estimation of the mechanical properties by non-destructive testing, the \n\nfoliation and heterogeneity effects increase the variation in the data (Figure 6.9); thus, the \n\naverage gneissic rock behaviour is characterized. High coefficients of determination were \n\nobserved for the relationships among UCS, ITS and E from the non-destructive tests (RL \n\nand Vp values), despite the low amount of E data used for the correlation (Figure 6.9). \n\nThe sclerometry device used was a useful tool for the rock weathering characterization, \n\nalthough a weaker sclerometry device could have been used for the characterization of \n\nadvanced weathered grade rock materials, as interpreted above; however, when correlated \n\nwith mechanical properties, the variation in rebound number was most significant in the \n\nlow weathering grades (Figure 6.9a).  \n\nThe rock samples broken in the sclerometry tests were recycled and used in the \n\nITS tests, which providing information for rock weathering characterization in field \n\ninspections, although the foliation effect was not fully assessed (Figure 6.9c-d). The IVp \n\nindex was not capable of distinguishing grades W1 and W3, and its relationship with Vp \n\nwas consistent with those of the other properties (Figure 6.9b, d, e). The correlations using \n\nRL and VP to determine UCS, ITS and E were represented by power functions. These \n\nrelationships are important in practical applications because RL and VP can be used to \n\ndetermine in situ conditions and mechanical parameters indirectly. \n\n \n\n\n\n139 \n\n \n\n \n\n139 \n\n \n\n2 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8\n0\n\n40\n\n80\n\n120\n\n160\n\n200\nU\n\nn\nia\n\nx\nia\n\nl \nc\no\n\nm\np\n\nre\ns\ns\niv\n\ne\n s\n\ntr\ne\n\nn\ng\n\nth\n, \nU\n\nC\nS\n\n (\nM\n\nP\na\n\n)\nB1\n\nB2\n\nB3\n\nB1\n\nB2\n\nB3\n\n2 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\nT\ne\n\nn\ns\nil\ne\n\n S\ntr\n\ne\nn\n\ng\nth\n\n, \nIT\n\nS\n (\n\nM\nP\n\na\n)\n\nB1\n\nB2\n\nB3\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\nB1\n\nB2\n\nB3\n\n2 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8\n\nBulk density, ?

According to the presented methodology, it is necessary to \n\ncorrectly identify the extreme porosity values (maximum, ?u, and minimum, ?f) for the \n\ncorrect application of the PWD index, as well as the maximum strength and elastic \n\n\n\n143 \n\n \n\n \n\n143 \n\n \n\nmodulus values (UCSmax, ITSmax and Emax) and the R (S,ITS,E) index. In addition, the \n\napplication of petrographic indexes, such as Ip, it should be supported by textural and \n\nmicromorphological criteria. A petrographic index based on a ratio of mineralogical \n\ncharacteristics seems better relates the weathering increase than a single aspect. \n\nThe results presented previously can explain the influence of weathering on the \n\npetrographic, physical and other measures and on the mechanical properties of the rock; \n\nthere are sufficient tests results to explore deeply. The index properties of the rock were \n\ntested, and the PWD presented results that better represent the weathering grade, which \n\ncan be determined by simple tests. The strength has to be normalized, as proposed by \n\nGupta and Rao (2001), and the same principle was used to normalize not only the UCS \n\nbut also the ITS and E (Eq. 6).  \n\n \n\n? =  \n????\n\n????\n=  \n\n????\n\n????\n=  \n\n??\n\n??\n                                                          (6) \n\n \n\nwhere R is the strength and stiffness degradation, UCS is the uniaxial compressive \n\nstrength, ITS is the indirect tensile strength, E is the elastic modulus, the subscript w \n\ndenotes weathered simples, and the subscript f denotes fresh samples. \n\nBoth the porosity and strength (or E) were normalized for the normalized curve, \n\nwhich represents the effect of weathering on the gneissic rock mass of the Monte Seco \n\nTunnel. The result of the normalized UCS, ITS and E versus PWD is presented in Figure \n\n6.12. Figure 6.12a is plotted on an arithmetical scale, and PWD is presented in the log \n\nplot in Figure 6.12b.  \n\nThe results indicate that one unique curve can be used to represent the degradation \n\nweathering effect (Figure 6.12). It is an interesting and innovated result that should be \n\ntested for other rock lithologies, and in the future, the general behaviour of mechanical \n\ndegradation under weathering should be determined. The degradation curve can be \n\nrepresented by Eq. 7: \n\n \n\n\n\n144 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n? =  \n100\n\n1+0.1 ???1.4\n                                                             (7) \n\n \n\nNote that the UCS, ITS and E degradation curves of the Monte Seco Tunnel rock \n\nmass have the same form (Eq. 7) and depend on PWD only. Therefore, the same \n\ndegradation function will be able to determine all parameters. For example, the weathered \n\nUCS is obtained by Eq. 8, and the same procedure can be performed for ITS and E. \n\n \n\n???? = ? ???? =  \n100\n\n1+0.1 ???1.4\n ????                                            (8) \n\n \n\nThese preliminary results motivated us to infer the application of this theory to \n\nother rock masses with similar mineralogical and textural characteristics. Five data points \n\nwere selected from the literature to represent UCS results for a large range of weathering \n\nconditions (PWD): gneiss (Dobereiner et al., 1993), quartzite and kinzigite (Gupta and \n\nRao, 2001), augen gneiss and leptinite (Marques et al., 2010). The literature data were \n\nnormalized by using the same approach as that used for the Monte Seco Tunnel test data \n\n(Eq. 4 and Eq. 6), and the results are presented in Figure 6.12c (arithmetic scale) and \n\nFigure 6.12d (PWD plot in log scale). The parameters used to normalize the mechanical \n\nparameters are shown in Table 6.3. The normalized literature data plot in the same range \n\nas the Monte Seco Tunnel data and can be represented by a unique function. The \n\ninnovative result is that Eq. 8 can be used with the results of all the data. Figure 6.12a \n\nindicates that Eq. 8 can represent the normalized results of UCS, ITS and E, and Figure \n\n6.12c shows the Eq. 8 fit result of UCS for different rocks with the same characteristics. \n\nA general, qualitative and quantitative synthesis of Monte Seco gneissic rock \n\nweathering is presented in Table 6.4. Table 6.4 was constructed for weathering grades I \n\nto V, for which the rock matrix mineralogical modifications were related to the \n\ngeotechnical parameters. For example, cordierite (Cr) and biotite (Bt) are minerals that \n\ncontrol the matrix bond loss of the gneissic rock of the Monte Seco Tunnel because they \n\ntrigger cracks in the adjacent minerals in grades III and IV (more intense cracking in \n\ndegree IV), a situation that does not occur in grades I and II. The weathering grades III \n\nand IV present significant reductions in their strength parameters, for example, grade III \n\n\n\n145 \n\n \n\n \n\n145 \n\n \n\nhas a UCS between 100-30, whereas grades I and II have a UCS> 100 MPa. Quantitative \n\ninformation about weathering (Table 6.4) is important for Monte Seco Tunnel \n\nmaintenance and future engineering interventions. \n\nThe PWD and R-value of Table 6.4b should be considered a general result for \n\ngneissic rock and similar lithologies and could be used to define the degradation effect \n\non mechanical properties. \n\n \n\nTable 6.3 - The porosity and uniaxial compression strength values \n\nReferences Rock ?f (%) ?u (%) \nUCSf \n\n(MPa) \n\nThis study Gneiss 0.2 22 165 \n\nDobereiner et al. \n\n(1993) \nGneiss 1.0 13 200 \n\nGupta and Rao \n\n(2001) \nQuartzite and 0.02 17 210 \n\nMarques et al. \n\n(2010) \n\nKinzigite 0.2 20 120 \n\nAugen Gneiss \n\nand \n0.5 15 120 \n\nLeptinite 0.5 14 160 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n146 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\nN\n\no\nrm\n\na\nli\nz\ne\n\nd\n p\n\na\nra\n\nm\ne\n\nte\nr \n\n(%\n)\n\nR = 100 / (0.1 + PWD1.4)\n                       R2 = 0.62\n\nUniaxial compressive strength\n\nTensile strength\n\nCompressive elastic modulus\n\n0.1 1 10 100\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\nUniaxial compressionstrength (MPa)\n\nTensilestrength(MPa)\n\nCompression elastic modulus (GPa)\n\n(a) (b)\n\nR = 100 / (0.1 + PWD1.4)\n                       R2 = 0.62\n\n0.1 1 10 100\nPhysical weathering degree, PWD (%)\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n(d)\n\nRUCS = 100 / (0.1 + PWD\n1.4)\n\n                       R2 = 0.83\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\nPhysical weathering degree, PWD (%)\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nN\no\n\nrm\na\n\nli\nz\ne\n\nd\n U\n\nC\nS\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\nGneiss (Dobereiner et al, 1993)\n\nQuartzite (Gupta and Rao, 2001)\n\nKinzigite (Marques et al, 2010)\n\nAugen Gneiss (Marques et al, 2010)\n\nLiptinite (Marques et al, 2010)\n\n(c)\n\nRUCS = 100 / (0.1 + PWD\n1.4)\n\n                       R2 = 0.83\n\nGneiss (Dobereiner et al, 1993)\n\nQuartzite (Gupta and Rao, 2001)\n\nKinzigite (Marques et al, 2010)\n\nAugen Gneiss (Marques et al, 2010)\n\nLiptinite (Marques et al, 2010)\n\n \n\nFigure 6.12 - The degradation curves of rock mechanical parameters due to weathering of the Monte Seco \n\nTunnel and of similar lithotypes. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n147 \n\n \n\n \n\n147 \n\n \n\nTable 6.4a - Weathering grades of gneissic rock matrix in terms of petrographic modifications \n\nPF WG Staining  \nNature of rock matrix \n\nmicrosystems  \n\nCondition of alteromorphs \n\nboundaries \nCondition of alteromorphs stages Ip mod \n\nB\n1\n\n -\n B\n\n2\n \n\nW1 \n\nI \nNo penetration of brown \n\niron staining. \n\nContact.

A \n\nmineralogical and petrological study was performed to explain the effect of weathering \n\non the rock microstructure. Three petrographic facies (B1, B2 and B3) were identified. \n\nThe weathering index of the gneissic rock mass was associated with its microsystem \n\nevolution, weathering pattern, textural and micromorphological classification. \n\nFacies B1 and B2 are rich in mafic minerals with tight intramineral fissures (biotite), \n\nresulting in higher density values than those for facies B3, which include felsic coarse-\n\ngrained minerals with incipient intra- to transmineral fissuring. \n\nIp mod was used to quantify the mineralogical weathering effect. The relationships \n\namong Ip mod, physical properties (bulk and porosity), RL and Vp were defined, and the \n\nindex clearly depended on both these rock properties and the weathering grade. \n\nThe anisotropy was determined from the transverse and parallel ITS results. The \n\neffect of anisotropy increases with weathering grades.   \n\nThe mechanical properties (UCS, ITS and E) and the bulk density, RL and Vp \n\ndecrease with increasing of porosity. These results directly reflect the influence of \n\nweathering on the mechanical properties. \n\nA general degradation curve for this gneissic rock mass and correlated lithology \n\nwas proposed. The normalized UCS, ITS and E of the Monte Seco Tunnel rock mass fit \n\nthe same function and depend on PWD. The degradation curve can represent the \n\nweathering effect of 6 lithologies. This result may be different for rocks from other rock \n\nformations or with different microstructural arrangements, textures, mineralogies, etc. \n\nHowever, this paper introduces an approach for grouping normalized data and can be used \n\nto create a general classification of weathering grade associated with quantitative \n\ninformation. \n\n \n\n\n\n150 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6.8 References \n\n \n\nASTM D3967-08, 2008.

GENERAL REMARKS \n\n \n\nIn the weathering study of the gneissic rock mass, the geological and geotechnical \n\ninvestigations focusing on structural geology were of fundamental importance to develop \n\nthe concept model of weathering advance in the Monte Seco Tunnel. The study of the \n\ngenesis of the structures along the geologic time helped explain the difference of intensity \n\nand type of fracturing that affects the rock mass in depth, permitting characterize specific \n\nweathering profiles along the tunnel. The weathering advance in the gneissic rock mass \n\nis clearly structurally controlled. \n\nIn the critical sector C, ca. 120 m far from the southern entrance, the weathering \n\nadvanced via foliation Sn and discontinuity set F2 of the Precambrian age, reactivated \n\nduring the Cretaceous, and via discontinuity set F1 of Cenozoic age. The Neotectonism \n\n(Cenozoic age) is responsible the changing the drainage pattern in the study area and for \n\noriginating discontinuity set F1, which currently conditions water infiltration in sector A. \n\nThis process is also responsible for the denudation and uplift of the rock mass, which \n\nhelped the formation of relief fractures (discontinuity set F3) related to the foliation, \n\nparallel to hillside in sector B. These geologic events trigger the destabilization of rock \n\nblocks that impact iron ore transport logistics by the VALE S.A. Vit\u00f3ria-Minas Railway \n\nin the Monte Seco Tunnel. The sector D there is no conditions to weathering advance and \n\nthe fall of blocks can be disregarded comparatively to sectors A, B and C. \n\nOnce the weathering was recognized throughout the rock mass, the heterogeneity \n\nof the intact rock was classified in petrographic facies and analyzed by thin sections and \n\nphysical-mechanical tests. The use of standardized classification of the textural and \n\nmicromorphological modification of the minerals helped characterize the increase of intra \n\nto transmineral fissures and the mineral weathering stages related to the mechanical \n\ndegradation in each weathering grade. These procedures were needed to understand the \n\ngneissic rock matrix transformations and identify the minerals - and modifications in their \n\ncrystal fabric - responsible for the alterability of the petrographic facies and the influence \n\nin the strength degradation in the tropical environment.  \n\nThe cordierite and biotite Meso-alteromorphs textural modifications acts as an edge \n\neffect triggering the increase of intra to transmineral fissuring processes of gneissic rock \n\n\n\n154 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nmatrix, which conducts a significant bond loss among whole minerals and progressively \n\ndrops in the gneissic mechanical values in the weathering grades II-III and III-IV, \n\nrespectively. The increase of grain size of the minerals from facies B1 to B3 influenced \n\nthe fissure increasing and the cordierite weathering conducting higher disaggregation \n\nprocess to facies B3, comparatively to facies B1 and B2. Based on the petrographic and \n\nphysical-mechanical indexes, such as Ip, Id 4\u00b0 and RS, facies B3 was placed at the start of \n\nthe moderately weathered grade (III), thus an unfavorable rock matrix characteristic to \n\nthe Monte Seco Tunnel. \n\nThe development of this work also made it possible to propose an equation for \n\nestimating the alterability parameter in the RMR 2014 update, which contributes to a \n\nbetter distribution of its values and allows the distinction of geomechanical sections of \n\nheterogeneous geological substrates, such as the Monte Seco Tunnel. However, the \n\nassessment of this parameter by slake durability test needs to be further investigated by \n\nthe geological engineering community for define the number of cycles, his applicability \n\nand influences in tunneling projects.  \n\nA general degradation curve for this gneissic rock mass and correlated lithology \n\nwas proposed. The normalized UCS, ITS and E of the Monte Seco Tunnel rock mass fit \n\nthe same function and depend on PWD. The degradation curve can represent the \n\nweathering effect of 6 lithologies. This result may be different for rocks from other rock \n\nformations or with different microstructural arrangements, textures, mineralogies, etc. \n\nHowever, this dissertation introduces an approach for grouping normalized data and can \n\nbe used to create a general classification of weathering grade associated with quantitative \n\ninformation. \n\nThe methodology developed herein to the weathering study of a gneissic rock mass \n\ncan be applied to unsupported tunnels with problems of block instability, not only along \n\nthe Vit\u00f3ria-Minas Railway, but also in other geologically similar regions. The present \n\nstudy of the Mantiqueira Complex is of interest to Southern Brazil, where important \n\nmetropolitan regions are located, and which may demand projects and construction of \n\nunderground works, such as highway and railway tunnels."}]}}}
