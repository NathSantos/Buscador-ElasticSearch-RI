A op\u00e7\u00e3o por um determinado material de el\u00e9trodo \u00e9 feita em \n\nfun\u00e7\u00e3o da sua zona \u00fatil de potencial na solu\u00e7\u00e3o a utilizar. Esta zona de potenciais est\u00e1 limitada \n\npor diversos fatores, como a estabilidade estrutural, mec\u00e2nica, qu\u00edmica e eletroqu\u00edmica do \n\nmaterial de el\u00e9trodo, a forma\u00e7\u00e3o na sua superf\u00edcie de uma camada de uma subst\u00e2ncia isoladora \n\n(passiva\u00e7\u00e3o), a decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o do eletr\u00f3lito suporte, etc. A durabilidade do el\u00e9trodo nas \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es de trabalho, assim como o seu custo, s\u00e3o igualmente par\u00e2metros a ter em conta. O \n\nmaterial de el\u00e9trodo ideal para a degrada\u00e7\u00e3o de poluentes org\u00e2nicos deve exibir alta atividade \n\npara a oxida\u00e7\u00e3o e baixa atividade perante as rea\u00e7\u00f5es secund\u00e1rias (por exemplo, evolu\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\noxig\u00e9nio).   \n\nEste trabalho consistiu na prepara\u00e7\u00e3o de filmes de SnO2-SbOx que sejam estrutural, qu\u00edmica, \n\nmec\u00e2nica e electroquimicamente est\u00e1veis; estes materiais devem ainda ter tempos de vida \u00fatil \n\nprolongados, de modo a que possam vir a ser utilizados exaustivamente na degrada\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ncontaminantes, reduzindo assim o seu custo. \n\nAo longo deste trabalho, foram preparados diferentes filmes de \u00f3xidos mistos de estanho e \n\nantim\u00f3nio. Um dos m\u00e9todos utilizado foi a eletrodeposi\u00e7\u00e3o em camadas alternadas de estanho \n\ne antim\u00f3nio sobre um substrato. Foram testadas deposi\u00e7\u00f5es diretas sobre o substrato de tit\u00e2nio \n\nou sobre uma camada interm\u00e9dia de platina ou de cobre. Estas deposi\u00e7\u00f5es interm\u00e9dias t\u00eam \n\ncomo objetivo otimizar o tempo de vida \u00fatil do filme de \u00f3xidos.  \n\nDe seguida, e com o objetivo de obter filmes mais finos e uniformes, testou-se a \n\neletrodeposi\u00e7\u00e3o simult\u00e2nea de Sn e Sb, tendo utilizado substratos id\u00eanticos: Ti; Ti/Pt; Ti/Cu. \n\nDeste modo, foram preparadas v\u00e1rios materiais de el\u00e9trodos com base em filmes de \u00f3xidos de \n\nestanho e antim\u00f3nio, usando os dois m\u00e9todos de eletrodeposi\u00e7\u00e3o diferentes e com diferentes \n\ncamadas interm\u00e9dias. Para todos os materiais preparados foi realizada a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nestrutural, morfol\u00f3gica e eletroqu\u00edmica do el\u00e9trodo, recorrendo-se a v\u00e1rias t\u00e9cnicas, como \n\ndifra\u00e7\u00e3o de raios X, microscopia eletr\u00f3nica de varrimento e voltametria c\u00edclica. \n\nCom estes filmes de \u00f3xidos, ap\u00f3s a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o usual, foi efetuado um estudo sobre a rea\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde evolu\u00e7\u00e3o de oxig\u00e9nio, tendo-se determinado a energia de ativa\u00e7\u00e3o aparente da oxida\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\n\u00e1gua em cada um dos diferentes materiais. Conclui-se ainda que o fator de rugosidade \n\ninfluencia profundamente a rea\u00e7\u00e3o de evolu\u00e7\u00e3o de oxig\u00e9nio, pois o material com fator de \n\nrugosidade superior apresenta menor energia de ativa\u00e7\u00e3o aparente para a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o do oxig\u00e9nio.  \n\nOs materiais preparados sobre substratos contendo uma camada interm\u00e9dia de cobre \n\nmostraram ter apet\u00eancia para a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o do oxig\u00e9nio, n\u00e3o podendo contudo ser usados na \n\n\n\n viii \n\ndegrada\u00e7\u00e3o de poluentes org\u00e2nicos, pois este processo requer potenciais mais elevados, onde \n\nse d\u00e1 a oxida\u00e7\u00e3o do cobre e a desativa\u00e7\u00e3o do el\u00e9trodo. \n\nO el\u00e9trodo Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb que apresentava boas caracter\u00edsticas para ser utilizado em eletro-\n\noxida\u00e7\u00e3o, foi utilizado na degrada\u00e7\u00e3o de solu\u00e7\u00f5es de 100 mg L-1 de diclofenac, tendo-se obtido \n\nremo\u00e7\u00f5es de carga poluente de cerca de 50% ao fim de 6 h de ensaio. Para al\u00e9m disso, o material \n\nmanteve-se e com resultados reprodut\u00edveis ao fim de 200 h de ensaios.  \n\nO material que ao longo de todos os estudos j\u00e1 descritos mostrou apresentar uma maior \n\nestabilidade mec\u00e2nica, qu\u00edmica e eletroqu\u00edmica, o Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4, foi usado na degrada\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde lixiviados de aterros sanit\u00e1rios, que s\u00e3o efluentes com cargas org\u00e2nicas e inorg\u00e2nicas muito \n\nelevadas. Este material foi ainda usado em amostras de efluentes simulados contendo \u00e1cido \n\nh\u00famico e sais inorg\u00e2nicos. Embora os resultados obtidos para este material em termos de \n\nremo\u00e7\u00e3o de carga org\u00e2nica sejam, em geral, ligeiramente inferiores aos obtidos com outros \n\nmateriais de \u00e2nodo, como o diamante dopado com boro (BDD) e o Ti/Pt/PbO2, os el\u00e9trodos de \n\nTi/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 provaram ser uma excelente alternativa \u00e0queles dois materiais. Em \n\nparticular, para a remo\u00e7\u00e3o de azoto total verifica-se que o \u00e2nodo Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 \u00e9 mais \n\neficiente do que o \u00e2nodo de BDD.    \n\n   \n\nPalavras-chave \n\nFilmes de SnO2-Sb2Ox; eletrodeposi\u00e7\u00e3o; evolu\u00e7\u00e3o de oxig\u00e9nio; eletrodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o de f\u00e1rmacos; \n\ndiclofenac; degrada\u00e7\u00e3o an\u00f3dica; lixiviados de aterros sanit\u00e1rios; \u00e1cido h\u00famico. \n\n  \n\n\n\n ix \n\nAbstract \n\n \nIn this work, SnO2-SbOx films were prepared over different substrates and utilizing different \n\nelectrodeposition techniques for the deposition of the tin and antimony layers over the \n\nsubstrates, namely alternate and simultaneous depositions. All the mixed oxides prepared were \n\nstructural, morphological and electrochemically characterized by, respectively, X-ray \n\ndiffraction, scanning electron microscopy and cyclic voltammetry.   \n\nTo obtain thinner and uniform films, Sn-Sb oxide materials were prepared using the \n\nsimultaneous and alternate deposition of the metals over several different substrates, namely \n\nTi; Ti/Pt; Ti/Cu. All these materials were fully characterized and used in a thermodynamic \n\nstudy to find the material most suitable for oxygen evolution. It was observed that: Materials \n\nroughness depends mainly on the substrates roughness, being Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb the material with \n\nhigher roughness; Oxides grown on Ti/Cu substrate presented the lowest potential for oxygen \n\nevolution, particularly the material prepared by simultaneous electrodeposition of Sn and Sb; \n\nThe roughness deeply influences the oxygen evolution potential.  \n\nTi/Pt/SnO2-Sb material, prepared by simultaneous Sn Sb electrodepositions, was utilized in a \n\ndegradation study, using as model pollutant diclofenac. It was observed a good degradation \n\nrate of the diclofenac, with the electrode material presenting good mechanical, chemical and \n\nelectrochemical stabilities.   \n\nFrom all the prepared materials, the Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 was the anode that presented more \n\nstability towards anodic oxidation, as well as the highest lifetime. For this reason, it was chosen \n\nto be used in the degradation of very complex real effluents, sanitary landfill leachates, and in \n\nthe degradation of humic acid. Results were compared with other anode materials, boron-\n\ndoped diamond (BDD) and Ti/Pt/PbO2. Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 electrodes proved to be an excellent \n\nalternative to the other materials, although they were not so efficient in the removal of the \n\norganic matter. On the other hand, they were more efficient than BDD in the removal of the \n\ntotal nitrogen.  \n\nThe exhaustive utilization of the Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anode, even with sanitary landfill leachates \n\nat 700 A m-2, has been showing that it is an excellent option to other electrode materials. \n\nHowever, the use of the platinization step increases its price and an alternative solution should \n\nbe further attempted. \n\n \nKeywords  \n \nSnO2-Sb2Ox films; electrodeposition; oxygen evolution; anodic degradation; electrodegradation \nof pharmaceutical drugs; diclofenac; sanitary landfill leachates; humic acid.  \n  \n\n\n\n x \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n xi \n\nIndex  \n\n \n\n1.

Introduction \n\n \n\nThis chapter presents an overview on the motivation to develop the studies involving the \n\npreparation, the characterization and the environmental applications of stannous and antimony \n\nmixed oxides. It defines also the main objectives and the strategy implemented to attain the \n\nobjectives.   \n\n1.1 Environmental context  \n\nDyes, toxic organic molecules, inorganic salts, adsorbable organohalogens, aromatic pesticide \n\nresidues, drugs, and surfactants are the major components of the wastewaters released from \n\ntextile, leather, pulp and paper, printing, photograph, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and food \n\nindustries [Rao et al., 2014]. Wastewaters containing these chemicals are refractory and are \n\noften toxic to microorganisms involved in the biological treatment processes. Other major \n\nenvironmental concern are the leachates formed by the percolation of rainwater through the \n\nsolid waste deposited on sanitary landfills [Fernandes et al., 2015]. \n\nIn order to solve the environmental problems posed by the presence of all the cited toxic \n\nsubstances, several methods, besides the biological processes, have been endeavoured [Sir\u00e9s \n\net al., 2014]. Electrochemical degradation processes are being developed as an attempt to \n\nsolve the environmental challenge posed by the effluents containing refractory substances, \n\nsince they are attractive processes due to their environmental compatibility, simplicity, \n\nrobustness in structure, and easy operation. Especially, electrolysis can be used as a \n\npretreatment technology to detoxify ahead of biotreatment, rather than mineralizing \n\ncompletely the effluent to be treated, with high cost [Comninellis and Chen, 2010]. \n\nAlthough organic wastes can, in general, be oxidized at numerous electrode materials, the \n\nelectrochemical efficacy depends on the kind and on the structure of the anode materials \n\n[Comninellis and Chen, 2010]. \n\nLong service lifetime, large surface area, wide operating potential window between hydrogen \n\nand oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotentials, high catalytic activity, physical stability, \n\nresistance to corrosion, low price, and easy to fabricate are the prerequisites to be fulfilled by \n\nthe anodes employed in the electrochemical wastewater treatment [Rao et al., 2014]. \n\nThe use of metallic oxide electrodes (MMO) for electrocatalytic oxidation of organic pollutants \n\nis very promising. These electrodes generally consist of a titanium substrate covered with \n\nmetallic oxide films, whose composition strongly affects their electrochemical behaviour. \n\nAmong the metallic oxide electrodes, tin and antimony mixed oxide electrodes are one of the \n\nbest candidates to be utilized as anodes for the electrochemical combustion of organic \n\npollutants, since, in general, they present higher oxygen overpotential than other metallic \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\noxide electrodes, particularly when the appropriate preparation techniques are employed \n\n[Huang et al., 2007]. Nevertheless, there are very few studies in the literature where this \n\nmaterial was utilized as anode for the degradation of complex mixtures [Cossu et al., 1998; \n\nFernandes et al., 2014; Fernandes et al., 2016]. \n\n \n\n1.2 Global aims \n\nThe main goal of this thesis was to search for an efficient tin and antimony metal oxides \n\nmaterial to be utilized as anode, to find suitable and low-cost electrochemical solutions for the \n\ndegradation of organic pollutants and refractory wastewaters, such as pharmaceutical \n\ncompounds, and refractory wastewaters, such as sanitary landfill leachates and synthetic \n\nwastewaters containing humic acid.   \n\nIn this context, the objectives of this study are: \n\n1. To prepare Sb-doped SnO2 materials that are structural, chemical, mechanical and \n\nelectrochemically stables. \n\n2. To obtain Sb-doped SnO2 materials with extended lifetime, suitable to be used in the \n\ndegradation of organic pollutants or in the oxygen evolution reactions. \n\n3. To find correlations between the preparation method and the abilities of the prepared \n\nmaterial for the different possible applications, namely degradation of organic \n\npollutants or oxygen evolution reactions. \n\n4. To find, among all the prepared materials which is the most appropriate to be used as \n\nanode in the degradation of different types of pollutants. \n\n \n\n1.3 Strategy \n\nTo attain the objectives defined in the previous point, the following strategy was implemented: \n\n1. To make Sb-doped SnO2 oxides using different preparation methods, namely alternate \n\nor simultaneously electrochemical depositions of tin and antimony layers, in order to \n\nobtain thin films with uniform surfaces, thus avoiding the interaction between the \n\nsolution and the substrate or any existent interlayer. \n\n2. To test different substrates, besides titanium, to avoid the formation of the TiO2 \n\npassivating film. A platinum interlayer was deposited over the titanium substrate and \n\nother substrates, such as copper, were also tested.  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\n3. To perform the structural, morphological, chemical and electrochemically \n\ncharacterization of the oxides, for all the new materials prepared, to assess the \n\ninfluence of utilizing different deposition techniques or the deposition over different \n\nsubstrates. \n\n4. To perform a thermodynamic study, to evaluate some of the properties of the new \n\nmaterials and understand the influence of the metals deposition technique and of the \n\nsubstrate on that properties. \n\n5. To utilize the prepared materials that presented the most favourable properties for the \n\ndegradation of different pollutants/wastewaters. \n\n \n\n1.4 Thesis overview \n\nThis thesis is divided into five chapters. This first chapter presents the context in which this \n\nthesis is inserted and the overall goals to attain with the studies performed. It also gives a \n\ndescription of the strategy to achieve the proposed objectives. \n\nThe second chapter contains a literature review on the preparation methods of tin and antimony \n\nmixed oxides and their environmental applications.  \n\nChapter 3 presents a description of the preparation methods employed to obtain the different \n\ntin and antimony oxide materials, utilizing different metal deposition strategies and different \n\nsubstrates. This chapter also contains the structural and morphological characterization of the \n\nprepared materials, as well as the assessment of the relative roughness of the prepared \n\nmaterials, utilizing electrochemical techniques. \n\nIn Chapter 4, a thermodynamic study of the oxygen evolution reaction at the oxide anodes \n\ndescribed in the previous chapter is presented. Chapter 4 also contains one environmental \n\napplication of Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb anode, in the degradation of diclofenac, and two environmental \n\nstudies with Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anodes, using complex effluents, such as real leachate from \n\nsanitary landfills and simulated wastewaters, containing humic acid. At the end of both studies, \n\nthe degradation efficiency of this material is compared with other reference anode materials, \n\nnamely, Ti/Pt/PbO2, and commercial boron-doped diamond (BDD) anodes.  \n\nFinally, Chapter 5 presents the main conclusions obtained in this work, as well as some \n\nproposals for future work.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\n2. SnO2-Sb2Ox films - Literature review \n\n \n\nSnO2 in its pure form is an n-type semiconductor, with a band gap of about 3.5 eV, which cannot \n\nbe used directly as electrode material due to its high resistivity at room temperature. The \n\nconductivity, the electro-catalytic properties and the stability of the SnO2 films can be deeply \n\nincreased by the introduction of dopant ions.  \n\nAntimony is one of the most commonly used dopants in SnO2 films, because it can reduce the \n\nband gap and increase the conductivity and the electro-catalytic activity [Comninellis and \n\nChen, 2010]. When doped with Sb, SnO2 electrodes present high overpotential for the oxygen \n\nevolution and electro-catalytic characteristics suitable for the oxidation of organic pollutants \n\n[Kong et al., 2007].  \n\nIn this chapter, a literature review on the different preparation methods of the stannous oxides, \n\nand the influence of the preparation method on the oxides properties will be first discussed. \n\nThe influence of the SnO2 doping agent on the applications of the oxides will be also assessed. \n\n  \n\n \n\n2.1 Films preparation methods \n\n \n\nThe mixed metal oxide anodes are cheap and easy to fabricate [Rao et al., 2014]. Various \n\npreparation methods have been attempted to produce SnO2-Sb2Ox anodes. In general, these \n\nmethods fall into two main groups: chemical methods, such as, thermochemical decomposition, \n\nelectrodeposition, sol\u2013gel method, spin coating, Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), spray \n\npyrolysis; and physical methods, like magnetron sputtering [Chen et al., 2010a; Zhang et al., \n\n2014]. However, when the objective is to prepare metal oxide anodes, the most common \n\nprocedure is the layer by layer synthesis techniques, including thermochemical degradation of \n\nthe support layer and electrodeposition of the active layer. This usually results in good anti-\n\ncorrosion characteristics of the inner layer and good electro-catalytic of the outer layer [Wu et \n\nal., 2014]. To ensure the stability of the oxides layer, it is necessary to ensure a good adhesion \n\nof this layer on the substrate. Thus, it is important to perform a pretreatment to remove grease \n\nor oxides from the surface of metal substrate, which might influence the layer adherence \n\n[Comninellis and Chen, 2010]. \n\nOne of the most used substrates is titanium and many of the variations in the preparation of \n\nSnO2 electrodes are meant to extend the lifetime of the electrode, a problem associated with \n\nthe performance of the Ti/SnO2 electrodes.  \n\nThe interaction of the electrode material with the substrate may also influence the chemical \n\nadsorption and the catalytic properties of the deposited metal oxides. Several studies have \n\nconcluded that Ti/SnO2-Sb2O4 anodes have a short lifetime due to the formation of an \n\nintermediate layer of TiO2 with high resistivity [Berenguer et al., 2009]. This layer can be \n\nformed during the electrode preparation or during its use as anode because oxide films have a \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nconsiderable porosity. In both cases, the formation of a TiO2 interlayer is inevitable [Chen et \n\nal., 2005; Cossu et al., 1998 and Stucki et al., 1991a]. To avoid the formation of the TiO2 \n\ninterlayer, various attempts have been made, such as pre-platinization of the substrate, \n\naddition of an IrO2 layer and deposition of a Cu film over the substrate [Chen et al., 2005; \n\nComninellis, 1992; Cossu et al., 1998; Johnson et al., 2000; Rodgers et al., 1999]. \n\nIn the following paragraphs, the main methods described in the literature for the preparation \n\nof metal oxide films will be discussed, giving a special emphasis to those utilized in the \n\npreparation of antimony-doped tin oxides. The influence of the preparation methods on the \n\ncharacteristics of the films will be considered. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1.1 Thermochemical decomposition \n\nThermochemical decomposition, or pyrolysis, is the most widely applied method for the \n\nfabrication of Sb-SnO2-based MMO anodes or Ir- and Ru-based MMO anodes. The main advantage \n\nof this synthesis method is its easy operation. In a typical thermochemical decomposition \n\nprocedure, the metal salts, in general metal chlorides, are directly dissolved. The solvent used \n\nmay be isopropanol, ethanol, butanol or their mixtures. In order to avoid the hydrolysis of the \n\nmetal salts, it is necessary to acidify the precursor solution by adding hydrochloric acid. The \n\ncalcination temperature is also a very important factor and it plays a critical role in the \n\nelectrocatalytic performance of MMO anodes [Feng, 2010; Wu et al., 2014]. \n\nThe MMO properties, such as, chemical composition, crystallinity and crystal grain size, surface \n\nmorphology, electrical conductance, electrocatalysis performance, and electrode stability, are \n\naffected by the precursor composition, solvents and loadings, substrate pretreatment, and \n\nthermal decomposition parameters, especially the temperature and the duration of the \n\npreparation and calcinations processes [Comninellis and Chen, 2010]. \n\nIn general, the Sb-SnO2 films have a \u201ccracked-mud\u201d morphology, being formed by small uniform \n\nparticles, and the electrode surface presents low roughness /porosity [Wu, 2014]. \n\n \n\n2.1.2 Electrodeposition  \n\n \n\nElectrodeposition is a simple and cheap method for the preparation of metal oxides, even for \n\nlarge-scale production [Chen et al., 2010 b]. This method allows the direct deposition of the \n\nmetal layer over the substrate, with a good control of the deposited amount and without \n\nneeding adhesive substances to join the metal layer to the substrate [Bartlett, 2002; Chen et \n\nal., 2010 b; Comninellis and Chen, 2010; Musiani, 1997]. \n\nElectrodeposition is analogous to a galvanic cell acting in reverse. To deposit a metal, the \n\nsubstrate can be used as anode or cathode, and both electrodes must be immersed in an \n\nelectrolytic solution containing one or more dissolved metal salts. When the substrate is used \n\nas anode, the application of a direct current to the anode can oxidize the metal atoms, forming \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nthe metal oxide. If the substrate is utilized as cathode, the dissolved metal ions in the \n\nelectrolyte solution are reduced and deposited over the cathode [Musiani, 1997]. \n\nElectrochemical deposition is rather used to prepare metals and conducting metal oxide films \n\nbecause it presents several interesting features: the thickness and morphology of the metal \n\noxide layer can be controlled by varying the experimental parameters and the films are \n\nuniformly deposited at good deposition rates [Comninellis and Chen, 2010; Chen, 2010b]. This \n\nfilm layer uniformity is very important if the films are to be used in electrodegradation studies. \n\nOther advantages of the electrodeposition technique is that it can be performed at low \n\ntemperature, with trivial equipment [Comninellis and Chen, 2010]. \n\nThe preparation of mixed metal oxides, like Sb-doped Sn oxides, can be prepared either by co-\n\nelectrodeposition together or by a sequencing electrodeposition [Comninellis and Chen, 2010]. \n\nIn general, the films obtained by electrodeposition present granular surface structure and high \n\nelectrocatalytic activity [Wu et al., 2014]. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1.3 Other preparation methods \n\n? Sol-Gel method \n\nThe sol-gel process is, in general, used to produce solid materials from small molecules. It can \n\nbe utilized to prepare metal oxides by the conversion of monomers into a colloidal solution \n\n(sol) that acts as the precursor for an integrated network (or gel) of discrete particles or \n\nnetwork polymers. Metal alkoxides can be used as typical precursors [Sakka, 2005; Wu et al., \n\n2014]. \n\nIn general, the precursor salts are hydrolyzed, by dispersion, in appropriate media, followed \n\nby vigorous stirring. The formation of solid phase particles from hydrolyzed precursor is time \n\ndependent [Rao et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014]. \n\nThe sol-gel process presents several advantages, such as: it allows deposition of thin films over \n\nsubstrates of different shapes or areas, and the films composition can be easily controlled by \n\ncontrolling the homogeneity and the concentration of the solutions, without using expensive \n\nequipment [Canevari, 2011; Sakka, 2005].  \n\nThe doped tin oxide films formed by sol-gel technique present heterogeneous cracked \n\nmorphology. They have low impedance and very good electrocatalytic activity [Wu et al., \n\n2014]. \n\n \n\n? Spin Coating \n\nThe spin coating technique is the most indicated for flat substrates because it leads to very \n\nuniform coatings. For uneven substrates, dip coating or painting is preferred. In the spin coating \n\ntechnique, a small amount of the coating material is deposited at the center of the substrate \n\nthat is rotated at high speed to spread the coating material, due to the centrifugal force. The \n\nmaterial is then dried and the process of coating and drying is repeated until a desired thickness \n\nof the coat is obtained. Finally, the coated substrate is annealed to obtain the desired thickness \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nthat will give the material the wanted morphological characteristics and wear resistance [Rao \n\net al., 2014]. \n\n \n\n? Chemical Vapor Deposition \n\nIn Chemical Vapor Deposition, generally the reactant (precursors) gases are pumped into the \n\nreaction chamber, maintained at optimum temperature and pressure, where these reactive \n\ngases are adsorbed and react with the substrate to form a thin film. Metal organic chemical \n\nvapor deposition utilizes organometallic compounds as precursors. Using this technique, thin \n\nfilms with high uniformity can be reproduced. However, it involves complex processes, high \n\ntemperature, and toxic gases. Amjoud et al. (1998), Duverneuil et al. (2002), Yusta et al. (1997) \n\nand Watts et al. (2008) have used gas phase methods for the preparation of thin film metal \n\noxide-coated electrodes. \n\nCVD appears to be the least attempted chemical method for preparing MMO anodes, due to its \n\nhigh operation cost and the difficulty in introducing several metal precursors in the furnace \n\n[Rao et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014]. \n\nThe films prepared by this technique present dense, homogeneous surface with high roughness \n\n[Wu et al., 2014]. \n\nRecently, Ti/SnO2 anodes were prepared by chemical vapor deposition without O2 as a \n\nprecursor, H20 as a precursor was used, avoiding the formation of the TiO2 passivation layer. \n\nThese electrodes presented a compact microstructure with high overpotential for oxygen \n\nevolution and a superior activity for pollutant oxidation. Although a higher surface area should \n\nlead to improved catalytic properties in this electrode (as in BDD) prepared by CVD, the surface \n\narea was smaller than when prepared by conventional methods, but the catalytic properties \n\nwere still improved.  \n\n \n\n? Spray Pyrolysis \n\nSpray pyrolysis is an aerosol process, relatively simple and cost effective. It involves the \n\natomization of the precursors in the form of droplets and the conversion of these droplets into \n\nsolid particles by heating. The nature of the deposit obtained on the substrate is dependent on \n\nthe transformations suffered by the droplets. There are several parameters influencing the \n\ntransformations experienced by the droplets, namely, the temperature gradient between the \n\nspraying nozzle and the substrate, the carrier gas and precursor solution flow velocity, and \n\nshape and nature of the substrate [Rao et al., 2014]. \n\n \n\n? Magnetron Sputtering \n\nIn the basic sputtering process, a target (or cathode) plate is bombarded by energetic ions \n\ngenerated in a glow discharge plasma, located in front of the target. The bombardment process \n\ncauses the removal, i.e., \u201csputtering\u201d, of target atoms, which may then condense on a \n\nsubstrate as a thin film.  \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nSecondary electrons are also emitted from the target surface as a result of the ion \n\nbombardment, and these electrons play an important role in maintaining the plasma. The basic \n\nsputtering process has been known for many years and many materials have been successfully \n\ndeposited using this technique [Kelly and Arnell, 2000]. \n\nThe sputtering method presents several advantages, namely high adhesion of films, facility of \n\nsputtering any metal, alloy or compound, high-purity films, ability to coat heat-sensitive \n\nsubstrates, and excellent uniformity on large-area substrates, which explains the numerous \n\napplications of the sputtered films [Barrocas et al., 2013]. \n\n \n\n2.2 Applications of SnO2-Sb2Ox films \n\n \n\nThere are a multitude of examples in the literature about possible applications of antimony-\n\ndoped tin oxides [Lan et al., 2015; Mueller et al., 2015]. However, as this study was mainly \n\nfocused on environmental applications and water oxidation using SbSn mixed oxides, a \n\nliterature review on these subjects will be presented below.  \n\n \n\n   \n\n2.2.1 Environmental applications \n\n \n\nPollution by recalcitrant organic compounds is a significant environmental problem mainly \n\nbecause the most spread wastewater treatments are based on biological processes that fail in \n\ntheir degradation. To prevent the release of these compounds to the environment new \n\ntreatment techniques to complement or even substitute the biological processes must be \n\ndeveloped. In particular, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), processes where there is \n\nproduction of OH radicals, are being under intensive study, since they can operate in an \n\nefficient and sustainable way [Chaplin, 2014; Sir\u00e9s et al., 2014]. \n\nAmong AOPs, electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) have emerged as a \n\npromising technologies for the destruction of recalcitrant compounds and complex wastewaters \n\n[Chaplin, 2014; Sir\u00e9s et al., 2014]. \n\nThe electrochemical treatment effectiveness depends on many factors, namely, on the \n\nelectrode material, because its nature is determinant for the type of mechanism involved in \n\nthe pollutants degradation process and strongly influences its selectivity and efficiency \n\n[Comninellis and Chen, 2010; Panizza and Cerisola, 2005]. \n\nThere are several electrochemical techniques for the pollutants removal or degradation, such \n\nas electrocoagulation/flocculation, electro-Fenton, cathodic reduction, and anodic oxidation. \n\nSince the anodic oxidation was the technique utilized in this thesis for the degradation of \n\nseveral types of polluted wastewaters, the following paragraphs will be mainly focused on the \n\napplication of this process using MMOs. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nThe ideal electrode material for the electro-oxidation of organic pollutants should be stable as \n\nanode in the electrolytic medium and present high activity for the oxidation of the organic \n\nmatter and low activity towards secondary reactions. It should also be cheap and environmental \n\ncompactible [Chen et al., 2010b; Comninellis and Chen, 2010; Maharana et al., 2015]. \n\nComninellis (1994) has investigated different anode materials, namely Pt, Ti/IrO2, and Ti/SnO2, \n\nin the electrochemical conversion/combustion of several organic pollutants. Simplified \n\nmechanisms for electrochemical oxidation and combustion were presented, being the first step \n\nof the mechanism the discharge of water molecules to form \u2022OH radicals: \n\n \n\nMOx + H2O ? MOx(\u2022OH) + H\n+ + e-                 (1) \n\n \n\nDepending on the nature of the electrode material (MOx), selective oxidation (for \u2018\u2018active\u2019\u2019 \n\nelectrodes) or combustion (for \u2018\u2018non-active\u2019\u2019 electrode) can occur. The Ti/SnO2 has been \n\nconsidered \u201cnon-active\u201d electrode since Sn(IV) is the highest oxidation state. This anode has \n\nhigh overvoltage for oxygen evolution reaction and can promote the oxidation of organic \n\ncompounds by highly reactive OH radicals, generated at the electrode surface [Comninellis, \n\n1994]. \n\nThe performance of doped SnO2 electrodes is believed to be superior to Pt, graphite, PbO2, and \n\nmany other common electrodes, due to its higher current efficiency and because the oxidation \n\nreactions on the SnO2 electrode are very unselective, which gave to this electrode the \n\npossibility of being applied to a multitude of different wastewaters [Chen et al., 2005; \n\nComninellis and Pulgarin, 1993; Stucki et al., 1991a; Stucki et al., 1991b].  \n\nThe anodic oxidation of phenol was performed on different electrode materials and a SnO2\u2013\n\nSb2O5 electrode showed the highest ability to completely oxidize phenol among PbO2, IrO2, \n\nRuO2, and Pt, and with a current efficiency over three times higher than for the other electrodes \n\n[Rodgers et al., 1999]. In addition, the behavior of a Ti/SnO2\u2013Sb2O5 electrode in the \n\nelectrodegradation of phenol in the presence of NaCl was studied and compared with that of a \n\nTi/IrO2 electrode, but the indirect oxidation process attributed to ClO\n- was only verified with \n\nthe Ti/IrO2 electrode [Comninellis and Nerini, 1995]. \n\nTi/SnO2 and Ti/IrO2 anodes were also used in the oxidation of 1,4-benzoquinone [Pulgarin et \n\nal., 1994]. With Ti/IrO2, non-toxic carboxylic acids were obtained as final products, while these \n\ncarboxylic acids were oxidized to CO2 with Ti/SnO2. \n\nPolcaro et al. in 1999 compared the performance of Sb-doped Ti/SnO2 and Ti/PbO2 anodes in \n\nthe electrochemical degradation of 2-chlorophenol and concluded that Ti/SnO2 presented a \n\nbetter ability to oxidize toxic compounds. These two electrode materials were also used in the \n\nelectrochemical treatment of landfill leachate, but did not show substantial differences under \n\nthe experimental conditions used, achieving a COD removal of 50% from a leachate with an \n\ninitial COD of 1200 mg/L [Cossu et al., 1998]. A Ti\u2013SnO2\u2013Sb2O5 electrode, prepared by the \n\nthermal method, and a BDD electrode were used in the anodic oxidation of acetic acid, maleic \n\nacid, and phenol [Chen et al., 2003]. Interestingly, the BDD electrode presented a higher \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\ncurrent efficiency and service-life. Furthermore, a mixed oxide electrode of Ti/SnO2\u2013Sb2O3\u2013\n\nNb2O5/PbO2 was applied to the oxidation of phenol with good performance [Yang et al., 2009]. \n\nThe SnO2\u2013Sb2O3 layer was obtained by dipping and annealing at 450 \u00baC under an influx of oxygen, \n\nfollowed by Nb2O5/PbO2 electrodeposition. Recently, the anodic oxidation of 4-chloro-3-\n\nmethylphenol in aqueous solution using Ti/SnO2\u2013Sb/PbO2 electrodes was investigated [Song et \n\nal., 2010]. PbO2 was used because it is a cheap material, easy to prepare and has low resistivity, \n\ngood chemical stability and, with a SnO2 + Sb2O3 interlayer, increased lifetime and \n\nelectrocatalytic activity.  \n\nIn another recent report in this area, Sb-doped SnO2 electrodes were prepared by two different \n\nmethods, electrodeposition followed by thermal oxidation, which gave a nanocoated material, \n\nand by a dip-coating method, where a non-nanocoated material was obtained [Liu and Feng, \n\n2009]. When comparing the performance of both these electrodes, the nanocoated electrode \n\ngave a faster and higher phenol and TOC removals, probably due to the larger specific surface \n\narea and oxygen adsorption.  \n\nThe various studies found in the literature have shown that doped Ti/SnO2 is a very promising \n\nmaterial for the electrodegradation of organics, due to its unselective character toward anodic \n\noxidation and also because of its low price, especially when compared to BDD.  \n\n \n\n2.2.2 Oxygen Evolution \n\n \n\nThe anodic activity of an electrode material depends on the overpotential for oxygen evolution \n\nreaction. If the material is to be used in the production of oxygen from the water \n\nelectrooxidation reaction, there are advantages in choosing materials with a low overpotential \n\nfor oxygen evolution so that the energy consumption becomes lower. Additionally, at these \n\nmaterials, the direct anodic oxidation of pollutants occurs with high efficiency for low current \n\ndensities [Armenta-Armenta and Diaz, 2005] because if the current density is high, a significant \n\ndecrease in the current efficiency is expected due to oxygen evolution. However, it was \n\nobserved that the electrochemical combustion of most of the organic compounds only occurs \n\nwithout the loss of electrode activity at anode materials presenting high overpotential for \n\noxygen evolution [Comninellis, 1994]. According to a compilation of values for oxygen evolution \n\noverpotentials at different anode materials presented by Chen [2004] in a review paper, SnO2 \n\nand PbO2 anodes have similar oxygen evolution overpotentials, which are higher than that of \n\nplatinum and lower than that of BDD. Thus, regarding current efficiency, SnO2 or PbO2 anodes \n\nare more advantageous than BDD. The anodic oxidation of pollutants is more efficient in the \n\noxygen evolution region because, in addition to avoiding polarization of the electrode\u2019s surface, \n\nhydroxyl radicals can be produced and promote pollutant oxidation by indirect processes, \n\nalthough with a decrease in the current efficiency due to the competition between \n\nwater/pollutant oxidation. \n\nAlthough anodic oxidation is an effective technique for producing oxygen or oxidizing organic \n\npollutants, to achieve good oxidation rates, the choice of the appropriate anode material is of \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\ngreat importance, and it must possess suitable oxygen overpotential, good electrical \n\nconductivity and electrochemical and mechanical stabilities [Mart\u00ednez-Huitle et al., 2004; \n\nMart\u00ednez-Huitle and Andrade, 2011; Sir\u00e9s and Brillas, 2012; Wu et al., 2011; Zheng et al., 2011]. \n\nVarious electrode materials, such as platinum, carbon, BDD and metal oxides, namely PbO2, \n\nSnO2, RuO2 and IrO2, have already been studied [Cir\u00edaco et al., 2009; Panizza and Cerisola, \n\n2004; Sir\u00e9s and Brillas, 2012]. Among them, SnO2 has been extensively tested due to its low \n\npreparation cost.  \n\nAlthough the increasing concern over environmental pollution brought renewed attention to \n\nresearch for suitable anode materials, the interest in the kinetics and mechanism of the oxygen \n\nevolution reaction in the process of the water electrolysis still remains of great importance \n\n[Villullas et al., 2003]. The study of the electrocatalytic properties of electrodes coated with \n\nfilms of metal oxides is of fundamental importance for the understanding of their \n\nelectrochemical behavior, including the Tafel slope, exchange current density, the effect of \n\nthe temperature on the kinetic parameters and the apparent activation energy [Lassali et al., \n\n1999; Suffredini et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2011].  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\n3. Preparation and characterization of tin and \n\nantimony mixed oxides \n\n \n\nThis chapter presents the preparation method and the results from the characterization of the \n\nSb-doped SnO2 films, prepared by different techniques and utilizing different substrates: \n\n? Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4, prepared by alternate electrodeposition over a platinized titanium foil; \n\n? Ti/Cu/SnO2-Sb2O3, prepared by alternate electrodeposition over a titanium foil previously \n\nrecovered with a copper layer; \n\n? Ti/SnO2-Sb, prepared by simultaneous electrodeposition over a titanium foil; \n\n? Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb, prepared by simultaneous electrodeposition over a platinized titanium foil; \n\n? Ti/Cu/SnO2-Sb, prepared by simultaneous electrodeposition over a titanium foil previously \n\nrecovered with a copper layer. \n\nThe studies presented in this chapter were already published in specialized journals [Santos et \n\nal., 2013; Santos et al., 2014a]. \n\n   \n\n \n\n3.1 Materials and methods  \n\n \n\n3.1.1 Reagents  \n\nIn the preparation of the electrodes, the following reagents were used: titanium foil, 0.25 mm \n\nthick, 99.7%, Sigma-Aldrich; sodium hydroxide, 96.8%, Pronalab; oxalic acid, 99%, Merck; \n\nchloridric acid, 37%, Pronalab; H2PtCl6.xH2O, 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich; tin (II) chloride, 98%, Sigma-\n\nAldrich; antimony (III) chloride, 99%, Fluka; citric acid, 100%, Pronalab; copper sulfate, 99%, \n\nMerck; tartaric Acid, 99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich; Na4P2O7.10H2O, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich; Gelatine, Merck \n\nand Sulfuric Acid, 95 to 98%, Sigma-Aldrich. \n\n \n\n3.1.2 Characterization techniques \n\nThe electrodes were structurally characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) at room \n\ntemperature using a Rigaku DMAXIII/C diffractometer with Cu K? radiation (?= 0.15406 nm) at \n\n30 kV/40 mA. The diffraction patterns were collected in the range of 2? = 10\u201390\u00ba with a 0.028 \n\nstep and an acquisition time of 2 s per step.  \n\nThe morphologies were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and microanalysis was \n\nperformed by dispersive energy spectroscopy (EDS), in a Hitachi (S-2700)/Oxford (60\u201374) \n\nsystem, operating at 20 keV.  \n\nThe electrochemical behavior was evaluated by voltammetric studies. The cyclic voltammetric \n\nmeasurements were performed using a potentiostat/galvanostat VoltaLab PGZ 301, in a one-\n\ncompartment cell, with a 10 cm2 doped-Sb SnO2 electrode as the working electrode, a 5 cm\n2 \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\n(per side) platinum plate as the counter electrode and a commercial saturated Ag/AgCl,KClsat \n\nelectrode as the reference electrode. \n\nThe relative roughness factor, Rf, of the electrodes\u2019 coating was estimated by running cyclic \n\nvoltammetric curves with the prepared metal oxides as the working electrode. Because the \n\nelectrodes are made of conductive oxides, the double-layer charging current, I, which is closely \n\nrelated to the double-layer capacitance, C, of the electrode/solution interface, is linearly \n\ndependent on the scanning rate, ?. Thus, running cyclic voltammetries at different scan rates \n\nin the potential region where only double-layer charging currents are observed, different I \n\nvalues can be obtained for the different scan rates, at a constant E value that is the point at \n\nwhich an approximate symmetry for the anodic and cathodic currents is observed. From the \n\nplot of I versus ? a linear correlation can be obtained. The slope of the obtained equation \n\ndivided by the geometric area of the electrode yields the normalized capacitance of the \n\noxide/solution interface (C = dq/dE = dI/d?). To estimate the relative roughness factor of the \n\nfilms, the normalized capacitance is compared with that of an oxide with a smooth surface, \n\nwhich is assumed to be 60 \u00b5F cm-2. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2 Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 \n\n \n\n3.2.1 Electrode preparation \n\nTi substrates, with dimensions of 2 cm x 2.5 cm x 0.25 mm, were pre-treated by mechanical \n\npolishing followed by etching with 40 % NaOH (w/w) at 80 \u00baC for 2 h and 15 % oxalic acid (w/w) \n\nat 98 \u00baC for 1 h. The substrates were then washed with double-distilled water. Substrate \n\nplatinization was performed in a one-compartment double-walled cell connected to a \n\nthermostatic water bath, which enabled the recirculation of water at 65 \u00baC. The cell contained \n\na chloroplatinic acid solution, and a current density of 250 mA cm-2 was applied using the Ti \n\nsubstrate as the cathode and two platinum plates (8 cm2) as anodes.  \n\nAfter platinization, alternate Sn and Sb electrodepositions on the Ti substrate were carried out \n\nin the same cell. For the Sn deposition, 100 mL of an aqueous solution with 0.948 g of SnCl2 and \n\n2 mL of concentrated chloridric acid was used with a current density of 10 mA cm-2 maintained \n\nfor 30 min at 35 \u00baC. For the Sb deposition, 100 mL of an aqueous solution with 1.329 g of SbCl3 \n\nand 3.842 g of citric acid was used with a current density of 10 mA cm-2 maintained for 10 min \n\nat 35 \u00baC. These two procedures were repeated 4 times. \n\nAfter this treatment, the electrodes were heated in a tubular furnace at 550 \u00baC for 6 h, to \n\nobtain the respective oxides. The geometric area of the prepared electrodes was 10 cm2 (both \n\nsides). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\n3.2.2 Characterization \n\n \n\n? Structural Characterization by DRX \n\n \n\nAfter calcination at 550 \u00baC, an X-ray diffractogram of the Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 electrode was \n\nobtained (Figure 1) and compared with those from the JCPDS ICDS database. The presence of \n\nthe Sb2O4 (file PDF#11-0694, relative to an orthorhombic structure with a = 5.436 \u00c5, b = 4.81 \u00c5 \n\nand c = 11.76 \u00c5) and SnO2 (file PDF # 41-1445, tetragonal structure with a = b = 4.7382 \u00c5 and c \n\n= 3.1871 \u00c5) phases were confirmed. A platinum phase was also identified (PDF # 04-0802), \n\nprobably detected due to the porosity and thickness of the material.   \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1. X-ray diffractogram of the Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 composite oxide electrode in their final form after \ncalcination at 550 \u00baC.  \n\n \n\n? Morphological characterization by SEM \n \n\nMorphology views of the Ti substrate (Figure 2 a), platinized (Figure 2 b) and covered with the \n\noxides Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 electrode (Figure 3), are presented. The appearance of the Ti substrate \n\nplatinized is similar to cauliflower. The morphology of the Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 electrode is quite \n\ndifferent from that of the Ti/SnO2-Sb2O4 electrodes prepared in a similar way but without \n\nplatinization, which presented the characteristics of cracked mud [Andrade et al., 2004; Cir\u00edaco \n\net al., 2011; Zanta et al., 2003]. In fact, the morphology views of Figure 3 show a granular \n\nmorphology. \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. - Micrographs of the (a) Ti plate covered with (b) Pt.

Chemical Characterization by EDS \n \n\nThe results from the EDS analysis of the final stage of the Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 electrodes, in \n\natomic molar percentages, were as follows: O - 74%, Sn - 9% and Sb - 17%. The Sb content was \n\nhigher than expected, possibly because the final electrodeposited layer consists of antimony, \n\nwhich is more easily detected by EDS. \n\n \n\n? Relative roughness \n\n \n\nFigure 4 presents several cyclic voltammograms recorded at different scan rates between 2 and \n\n50 mV s-1 in 0.035 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution from 0.6 to 0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl,KClsat. The I values \n\nfor the different scan rates were obtained at E = 0.7 V versus Ag/AgCl,KClsat, the point at which \n\nan approximate symmetry for the anodic and cathodic currents was observed. From the plot of \n\nI versus ? for the Ti/Pt/SnO2\u2013Sb2O4 electrode (Figure 4 and inset), the following linear equation \n\nwas obtained: \n\n \n\nI (A) = 0.0245 ? (V s?1) + 0.000068, with r2 = 0.997     (2) \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nDividing the slope value by the geometric area of the electrode yields the normalized \n\ncapacitance of the oxide/solution interface, CTi/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4=0.00245 F cm\n-2. \n\nTo estimate the relative roughness factor of the Ti/Pt/SnO2\u2013Sb2O4 film, its capacitance was \n\ndivided by 60 \u00b5F cm-2, providing an Rf of 41 for the prepared material.  \n\nIn a previous work with these electrodes [Cir\u00edaco et al., 2011], which were not platinized and \n\nwith 4 alternate depositions of each metal, a normalized capacitance of 0.0466 F cm?2 and a \n\nroughness factor of 777 were obtained; however, the deposition time for each metal was 4 \n\ntimes longer. The roughness factors were lower for the platinized electrode prepared in this \n\nwork, likely due to the lower metal deposition time used in this case, which prevents the \n\ngrowth of surface imperfections and decreases the roughness factor of the films. The metal \n\ndeposition time was reduced to avoid excessive imperfections, which fall into the solution \n\nand increase electrode preparation costs. \n\nWu and co-workers in 2008 have prepared amorphous tin oxide (SnOx) films by cathodic \n\ndeposition on graphite, achieving a specific capacitance of 0.255 F cm?2 and a roughness \n\nfactor of 4167, which is much higher than that obtained in this work. This order-of-magnitude \n\ndiscrepancy between roughness factors is not unusual; the literature includes roughness \n\nfactors for metal oxide films that vary by factors of several thousand. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.

The copper deposition on \n\nthe Ti substrate, pretreated, was performed in a one-compartment double-wall cell connected \n\nto a thermostatic water-bath, which enabled the recirculation of water at 44\u00baC. The cell \n\ncontained a copper sulfate aqueous solution and a current density of 50 mA cm-2 was applied \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\nfor 0.5 h using Ti substrate as the cathode and two platinum plates as anodes [Mart\u00ednez-Huitle \n\nand Andrade, 2011]. After copper deposition, alternate Sn and Sb electrodepositions on the Ti \n\nsubstrate were carried out in the same cell and in the same method of section 3.2.1.  \n\nAfter this treatment, the electrodes were heated in a tubular furnace at 550 \u00baC, as for the \n\nTi/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4  \n\n \n\n3.3.2 Characterization \n\n \n\n?

For the Ti/SnO2-Sb anode preparation, simultaneous deposition of tin and antimony on \n\nthe Ti substrate was performed using a one-compartment double-wall cell connected to a \n\nthermostatic water-bath, which enabled the recirculation of water at 44\u00baC. The cell contained \n\na tin and antimony solution and a current density of 2.5 mA cm-2 was applied for 1 h using Ti \n\nsubstrate as the cathode between two Pt plate anodes. The molar ratios of the components of \n\nthe electrodeposition solutions were 16:1:54.8:5.9 of SnCl2:SbCl3:Na4P2O7.10H2O:C4H6O6, with \n\nthe SnCl2 concentration of 0.13 mol L\n?1.

Inset: Linear regression of I \n\nvs. ??with theoretical equation adjusted to the linear zone, with I measured at: 0.07 V. \n\n \n\n3.7 Discussion and conclusions   \n\nLooking at the structural characterization, when Sn and Sb electrodepositions were carried out \n\nsimultaneously the predominant phase was the SnO2, assigned according to the file PDF#41-\n\n1445 from the JCPDS ICDS database. In the materials prepared with a Pt or Cu electrodeposited \n\ninterlayer, Pt or Cu diffraction lines were, respectively, identified. When the Sn and Sb \n\nelectrodepositions were alternated, the formation of distinct Sn or Sb oxide phases was \n\nobserved: SnO2 (PDF#41-1445) and Sb2O4 (PDF#11-0694) or Sb2O3 (PDF#43-1071). This fact is in \n\nagreement with what was previously observed in the cases of Ti/SnO2-Sb2O4 [Cir\u00edaco et al., \n\n2011], with a different electrodeposition time from the one prepared in this work, and \n\nTi/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 [Santos et al., 2013], although antimony presents a different oxidation state \n\nwhen copper is the interlayer, possibly due to competition between copper and antimony for \n\nthe oxygen. An SbSn intermetallic phase (PDF#33-0118) can be detected in almost all of the \n\ndiffractograms. The simultaneous or alternated electrodeposition form of Sn and Sb produce \n\ndifferent results: when Sn and Sb electrodeposition is simultaneous, Sb may substitute Sn in the \n\nlattice, and only one oxide phase, SnO2, is obtained in addition to the intermetallic SbSn phase; \n\nwhen the Sn and Sb electrodeposition is alternated, the two oxide phases are obtained. In the \n\nfilms prepared by the simultaneous electrodeposition method, some diffraction lines, not \n\nassigned to the previous discussed phases, can be assigned to the Sn,Sb-P2O7 phases [Chernaya \n\net al., 2005; Xu et al., 2012; Hibino and Kobayashi, 2013] because pyrophosphate is used in the \n\nsimultaneous electrodeposition preparation method.  \n\nRegarding the SEM results, it can be observed that the introduction of a Pt or Cu interlayer \n\nincreases the roughness of the surface, particularly in the case of the Pt layer. Ti/SnO2-Sb and \n\nTi/Cu/SnO2-Sb present similar morphologies, with homogeneous Sn-Sb oxide crystallites with a \n\nglobular form consisting of 5-10 \u00b5m agglomerates of smaller crystallites. The structure is highly \n\nporous. The introduction of a Pt metallic interlayer reduces the porosity of the film and \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\npresents a more compact coating similar to cauliflower. However, the number of agglomerates \n\nis higher and presents lower dimensions, leading to a higher surface area.  \n\nIn Ti/SnO2-Sb2O4, prepared with a shorter deposition time than the one presented in Cir\u00edaco et \n\nal. (2011), shows a different morphology from the cracked mud view that characterizes these \n\nfilms [Andrade et al., 2004; Montilla et al., 2004]. This fact is related to the higher homogeneity \n\nobtained in the films prepared with shorter deposition times that prevents a higher separation \n\nof the two phases, with different thermal expansion coefficients. In Ti/Cu/SnO2-Sb2O3, two \n\ndistinct morphologies are presented, evidencing the two oxide phases identified by X-ray \n\ndiffraction: one with a sea sponge look, attributed to tin oxide, and another with a branched \n\ntree form, attributed to antimony oxide. \n\nConsidering the relative roughness the highest roughness factor was found for Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb. \n\nComparing Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb (Rf =201) prepared with simultaneous metal electrodeposition, with \n\nTi/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 (Rf =41), prepared in a previous work by alternating metal electrodeposition \n\n[Santos et al., 2013], it may be concluded that, for this platinized material, simultaneous \n\nelectrodeposition produces higher roughness factors, as shown by the SEM results (Figure 13 a \n\nand b, and [Santos et al., 2013]). The explanation for this fact is that the roughness of the \n\nplatinized titanium is very high (see Figure 2 b) and can influence the roughness of the posterior \n\nSnO2-Sb layer, whose thickness is low, because it is prepared with only one simultaneous Sn,Sb \n\nelectrodeposition. On the other hand, the Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 electrode is prepared with 4 \n\nalternating electrodepositions of each metal, leading to a higher thickness that can minimize \n\nroughness. Comparing the Ti/SnO2-Sb2O4 (Rf =18), prepared in this work, with Ti/SnO2-Sb2O4 (Rf \n\n=777), prepared in a previous work [Cir\u00edaco et al., 2011], both by alternating metal \n\nelectrodeposition but different electrodeposition durations, it can be concluded that a fourfold \n\nincreasing in the electrodeposition time increases the roughness. The main differences found \n\nin the roughness factors for the Sn-Sb oxide films prepared on Ti/Pt or Ti/Cu must be due to \n\nthe interlayers of Pt or Cu that present completely different aspects (see Figure 2 b and 6). \n\nFrom the observed roughness factors obtained for the films prepared in this work, it seems that \n\nthey depend on the substrate morphology, as well as on the electrodeposition process and \n\nprobably also on the film thickness. It is difficult to show a linear behavior for the roughness \n\nfrom the experimental details. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\n4. Environmental applications of tin and antimony \n\nmixed oxides  \n\n \n\nThis chapter presents different environmental applications of tin and antimony mixed oxides. \n\nIt starts with a description of the materials and methods utilized in the studies performed with \n\nthe different electrode materials.  \n\nThe results of the thermodynamic study of the oxygen evolution reaction for all the tin and \n\nantimony mixed oxides, whose preparation and characterization was described in the previous \n\nchapter, are then presented and discussed.  \n\nThe utilization of Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb as anode in the degradation of a pharmaceutical compound, \n\ndiclofenac, is also presented in this chapter. \n\nDue to its mechanical, chemical and electrochemical stabilities and extended lifetime, \n\nTi/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 was chosen as anode for the electrodegradation of complex mixtures, namely: \n\n? biologically pretreated sanitary landfill leachate and simulated samples, having in their \n\ncomposition only different N-containing compounds, without organic matter; \n\n? raw sanitary landfill leachate and synthetic samples, containing humic acid and \n\ninorganic salts, with COD and ammonium ion contents similar to that of the real \n\nleachate. \n\nThe results and the main conclusions obtained in these two studies are also presented in this \n\nchapter. \n\n \n\n4.1 Materials and Methods \n\n \n\n4.1.1 Reagents \n\nThe following reagents were used as purchased in the preparation of synthetic samples: \n\nAmmonium nitrate, calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, sodium chloride, humic acid, \n\nammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride and potassium chloride.  \n\nThe chemicals used as model pollutants and electrolyte were sodium diclofenac salt (DIC) and \n\nsodium sulfate, respectively. \n\nThe reagents were analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without \n\nadditional purification.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\n4.1.2 Samples characterization techniques \n\n \n\nSeveral parameters were used to characterize samples and to follow the electrochemical \n\nexperiments, namely chemical oxygen demand (COD), 5-day biochemical oxygen demand BOD5, \n\ndissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), total kjedahl nitrogen (TKN), ammonia \n\nnitrogen (AN), pH, conductivity (Cond.), suspended solids (SS), dissolved solids (DS) and UV\u2013\n\nvisible (UV-vis) absorption spectrophotometry. Also, chloride, nitrate, nitrite and ammonium \n\nconcentrations were determined by ion chromatography. In subsections below, a brief \n\ndescription of the analytical methods and equipment\u2019s used to determine each parameter is \n\npresented. \n\n4.1.2.1 Chemical oxygen demand \n\nThe COD is commonly used to indirectly measure the amount of organic matter in samples and \n\nto evaluate the performance of the oxidation treatment in these samples. It is defined as the \n\namount of a specified oxidant that reacts with the sample under controlled conditions. The \n\nquantity of oxidant consumed is expressed in terms of its oxygen equivalence. The basis for the \n\nCOD determination methods is that nearly all carbon content of the organic compounds can be \n\nfully oxidized to carbon dioxide with a strong oxidizing agent under acidic conditions. \n\nIn this work, COD was determined by closed reflux titrimetric method, following the procedure \n\ndescribed in Section 5220C of the Standard Methods [Eaton et al., 2005]. Dichromate ion is the \n\noxidant used in this method, being reduced to the chromic ion. In COD determinations, \n\ndigestion of the samples occurred in strongly acid solution with a known quantity of potassium \n\ndichromate that has to be in excess, and containing also a silver catalyst to oxidize resistant \n\norganic compounds and mercury sulphate to reduce interferences from the oxidation of chloride \n\nions. The samples closed reflux digestion was performed, using a thermoreactor Merck \n\nSpectroquant TR 420, during 2 h at 150 \u00baC. After digestion, the remaining unreduced K 2Cr2O7 \n\nwas titrated with ferrous ammonium sulphate, using ferroine as indicator, to determine the \n\namount of K2Cr2O7 consumed. The titration was performed using an automatic titrator Metrohm \n\n876 Dosimat Plus. The dichromate consumed by the sample is equivalent to the amount of \n\noxygen required to oxidize the organic matter. \n\n4.1.2.2 Biochemical oxygen demand \n\nThe BOD is defined as the amount of oxygen required for microbial metabolism of organic \n\nmatter dissolved in samples. Its function is similar to that of COD, since both measure the \n\namount of organic compounds present in waters and wastewaters. However, COD is less \n\nspecific, since it measures everything that can be chemically oxidized, and the BOD evaluate \n\nbiologically active organic matter. Biochemical oxygen demand determination occurs over some \n\nvariable period of time depending on temperature, nutrient concentrations, and the enzymes \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\navailable to indigenous microbial populations. This is not a precise quantitative test, although \n\nit is widely used as an index of the biodegradable organic matter present in a wastewater, \n\nbeing an important parameter to evaluate the quality of wastewaters\u2019 treatment results. \n\nBOD determination is a slow process that theoretically requires an infinite time to be \n\ncompleted. To overcome this drawback, it is determined the BOD5, which corresponds to an \n\nincubation period of 5 days at which about 60-70% of the reaction has occurred. It is also used \n\nthe BOD20, that corresponds to an incubation period of 20 days in which 95-99% of organic \n\nmatter has already been degraded. \n\nIn this work, BOD5 was determined by the respirometric method, following the procedure \n\ndescribed in Section 5210D of the Standard Methods [Eaton et al., 2005], which provided the \n\ndirect measurement of the oxygen consumed by microorganisms from an air enriched \n\nenvironment, in a closed vessel, under conditions of constant temperature (20\u00b11 \u00baC) and \n\nstirring. Manometric respirometers were used, which relate oxygen uptake to the change in \n\npressure caused by oxygen consumption while maintaining a constant volume. The assays were \n\nperformed in a WTW Oxitop IS 12 with Inductive Stirring System, in a WTW TS 606-G/2-i \n\nThermostat Cabinet, using lyophilized biomass PolySeed, commercially available. \n\n4.1.2.3 Dissolved organic carbon \n\nThe total organic carbon is the amount of organic carbon in the samples, expressed in \n\nconcentration of carbon. Unlike COD or BOD5, TOC is independent of the oxidation state of the \n\norganic matter. It is a global parameter that allows the evaluation of the mineralization \n\nefficiency of the leachate sample treatment. In the present work, it was measured DOC, which \n\nis the fraction of TOC that passes through a 0.45 \u00b5m pore-diameter filter. \n\nDOC was determined by the high-temperature combustion method, following the procedure \n\ndescribed in Section 5310B of the Standard Methods [Eaton et al., 2005]. Its value is not \n\nachieved by direct measurement, the method used in this work analyses separately the \n\ndissolved fractions of total carbon (DC) and inorganic carbon (DIC), and DOC is then determined \n\nby subtracting DIC from DC. \n\nThe DOC determinations were performed in a Shimadzu TOC-VCPH analyser, which combines \n\ncombustion catalytic oxidation at 680\u00b0C and non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) detection method. \n\nThe samples were filtered through a glass fiber filter, from Whatman (GF/F filter, 0.45 \u00b5m). \n\nFor the DC determinations, an automated process injected the sample into the combustion \n\nfurnace, where it undergoes combustion through heating at 680 \u00baC, with a platinum catalyst in \n\nan oxygen rich atmosphere. The water is vaporized and the organic and inorganic carbons are \n\noxidized to CO2 and H2O. The gas phase, containing the CO2, is transported by the carrier gas \n\nthrough a moisture trap and halide scrubbers, to remove water vapour and halides from the gas \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nstream before it reaches the detector. The CO2 concentration is then measured with non-\n\ndispersive infrared detector. DIC is measured separately by injecting the sample into a reaction \n\nchamber where it is acidified, and all inorganic carbon is converted to CO2, which is carried to \n\nthe detector and measured. The obtained DIC or DC values are the average of, at least, two \n\nmeasurements. Regularly, calibration curves are performed.  \n\n4.1.2.4 Total nitrogen \n\nThe total nitrogen determination accounts for all forms of organic and inorganic nitrogen \n\npresent in the leachate sample. Since before TN determinations samples are filtered through a \n\nGF/F Whatman filter, 0.45 \u00b5m, it is assumed that, in complex matrix samples as sanitary landfill \n\nleachates, TN stands for total dissolved nitrogen. \n\nTN was measured in a Shimadzu TNM-1 unit coupled with the TOC-VCPH analyser. All nitrogen \n\npresent in samples is first converted to nitrogen monoxide and nitrogen dioxide by catalytic \n\ncombustion in the furnace. Then, the nitrogen species react with ozone, to form an excited \n\nstate of nitrogen dioxide. Upon returning to ground state, the emitted light energy is measured, \n\nusing a chemiluminescence detector, and converted to TN. \n\n4.1.2.5 Total Kjeldahl nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen \n\nTKN measures the sum of organic nitrogen, ammonia and ammonium. It is determined using the \n\nKjeldahl method that determines all the nitrogen in the trinegative state present in the \n\nsamples. This method fails to account for nitrogen in the form of azide, azine, azo, hydrazine, \n\nnitrate, nitrite, etc.  \n\nTKN determinations followed the procedure described in Section 4500-Norg B of the Standard \n\nMethods [Eaton et al., 2005], and as equipment it was used a Kjeldatherm block-digestion-\n\nsystem and a Vapodest 20 s distillation system, both from Gerhardt, and an automatic titrator \n\nMetrohm 876 Dosimat Plus. \n\nThe method to determine TKN consists of heating the sample with sulfuric acid, which \n\ndecomposes the organic substance by oxidation to liberate the reduced nitrogen as ammonium \n\nsulfate. In this step, potassium sulfate is added to increase the boiling point of the medium and \n\ncupric sulfate is used as catalyst. After samples digestion, a small quantity of sodium hydroxide \n\nis added and the resulting ammonia solution is distilled from an alkaline medium, after adding \n\na boric acid solution in the presence of a mixture of indicators (methyl red and methylene \n\nblue). The ammonia present in the sample, corresponding to the amount of nitrogen contained \n\nin the initial sample, reacts with the boric acid, and is determined indirectly by the titration \n\nof the borate ion formed with a H2SO4 standard solution. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\nThe determination of ammonia nitrogen followed the procedure described in Section 4500-NH3 \n\nB and Section 4500-NH3 C of the Standard Methods [Eaton et al., 2005], using the same \n\ndistillation and titration systems used to determine TKN. The determination of ammonia \n\nnitrogen is similar to the determination of Kjeldahl nitrogen, although in this case the sample \n\ndoes not undergo digestion. For AN determinations, samples were buffered at pH 9.5 using a \n\nborate buffer to decrease hydrolysis of cyanates and organic nitrogen compounds. Then, they \n\nwere distilled into a boric acid solution, containing the mixture of indicators used in TKN \n\ndetermination, and titrated with a standard H2SO4 0.1 M solution. \n\n4.1.2.6 Ion chromatography \n\nIon chromatography is a process that allows the separation of ions based on their affinity to the \n\nion exchanger. The basic process of ion chromatography can be represented in four steps: \n\neluent loading to equilibrate the column, sample injection, separation of sample, and elution \n\nof the analyte. Elution is the process by which the compound of interest is moved through the \n\ncolumn. This happens because the eluent is constantly pumped through the column. Ion \n\nchromatography retains the analyte ions on the column based on coulombic interactions. The \n\nstationary phase surface displays ionic functional groups that interact with analyte ions of \n\nopposite charge. As the sample elutes through the column, the analyte ions interact differently \n\nwith the stationary phase. The affinity of the ions present in the sample with the stationary \n\nphase depends primarily on the ion charge and radius. \n\nIn section 4.3, ion exclusion chromatography was used in the determination of carboxylic acids. \n\nIt was performed using a Shimadzu 10Avp HPLC apparatus coupled with a Shimadzu SPD M20A \n\ndiode array detector. Acids were separated using an Aminex HPX \u2013 87H of Bio-Rad (7.8 mm ID \n\n\u00d7 300 mm) column at 35 \u00baC. The elution was performed in isocratic mode using an aqueous \n\nsolution of 4 mM of sulfuric acid as a mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6 mL min?1. The sample \n\nvolume injected was 100 \u00b5L. The detection wavelength was 210 nm. The concentrations of the \n\ndifferent ions were determined using calibration curves, prepared with standard solutions. \n\nIn section 4.4 and 4.5, ion chromatography was used in the determination of Cl?, NO3\n?, NO2\n\n? \n\nand NH4\n+ ions. It was performed using a Shimadzu 10Avp HPLC apparatus coupled with a \n\nShimadzu CDD 10Avp conductivity detector. Anions were separated using an IC I-524A Shodex \n\n(4.6 mm ID \u00d7 100 mm) column at 40 \u00baC. The elution was performed in isocratic mode using an \n\naqueous solution of 2.5 mM of phthalic acid and 2.3 mM of tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane \n\nas a mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.5 mL min?1. For the determination of the NH4\n+, an IC YK-\n\nA Shodex (4.6 mm ID \u00d7 100 mm) column at 40 \u00baC was used. The isocratic elution mode was used \n\nand the mobile phase was a 5.0 mM tartaric acid, 1.0 mM dipicolinic acid and 24 mM boric acid \n\naqueous solution at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min?1. For both analyses, the sample volume injected \n\nwas 20 \u00b5L. The retention time of the ions determined were the following: Cl? - 2.32 min; \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\nNO3\n? - 3.89 min, NO2\n\n? - 2.78 min and NH4\n+ - 5.13 min. The concentrations of the different ions \n\nwere determined using calibration curves, prepared with standard solutions. \n\n4.1.2.7 Voltammetric studies \n \n\nThe cyclic voltammetric measurements were performed with a potentiostat/galvanostat \n\nVoltaLab PGZ 301, in a one-compartment cell, with a 10 cm2 anode prepared as the working \n\nelectrode, a 5 cm2 (per side) platinum plate as the counter electrode and a commercial \n\nsaturated Ag/AgCl, KClsat electrode as the reference electrode. Voltammograms were recorded \n\nat scan rate 0.5 50 mV s?1 in 1 M KOH aqueous solution.  \n\n \n4.1.2.8 Other parameters \n\n? pH \n\nIn this work, the pH of the samples, thermostatised at 20 \u00baC, was measured using a pH meter \n\nHANNA (HI 931400). \n\n? Conductivity \n\nConductivity is a measure of the ability of an aqueous solution to carry an electric current. This \n\nability depends on the presence of ions, on their total concentration and mobility, and on the \n\ntemperature. In this work, samples conductivity was measured using a conductivity meter \n\nMettler Toledo (SevenEasy S30K). Before measurement samples were kept at 20 \u00baC. \n\n? UV-Vis absorption spectrophotometry \n\nUV-vis absorption spectrophotometry uses light in the visible and ultraviolet ranges. The \n\nabsorption or reflectance in the visible range directly affects the perceived colour of the \n\nchemicals involved. In this region of the electromagnetic spectrum, molecules undergo \n\nelectronic transitions. According to Beer-Lambert law, the absorbance of a solution is directly \n\nproportional to the concentration of the absorbing species in the solution and the pathlength. \n\nThus, for a fixed pathlength, UV-vis absorption spectrophotometry can be used to determine \n\nthe concentration of the absorber in a solution.  \n\nIn this work, UV\u2013Vis absorbance was measured from 200 to 800 nm using a Shimatzu UV-1800 \n\nspectrophotometer. The method was used to determine the variation in the absorbance of the \n\nsamples, as well as in the content of aromatic compounds during the electrodegradation assays. \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\n4.2 The oxygen evolution reaction at Sn-Sb oxide anodes \n\n  \n\nThe oxygen evolution reaction is one of the most intensively studied electrochemical reactions \n\ndue to its importance in practical applications such as water electrolysis, chloralkali cells, fuel \n\ncells, and secondary metal air batteries. \n\nThe OER is a very interesting process because of its high activation overpotentials in aqueous \n\nsolutions [Wu et al., 2011]. \n\nThe anodic activity of an electrode material depends on the oxygen evolution overpotential. If \n\nthe material is to be used in the production of oxygen from the water electrooxidation reaction, \n\nthere are advantages in choosing materials with a low overpotential for oxygen evolution so \n\nthat the energy consumption becomes lower. Additionally, at these materials, the direct anodic \n\noxidation of pollutants occurs with high efficiency for low current densities [Armenta-Armenta \n\nand Diaz, 2005] because if the current density is high, a significant decrease in the current \n\nefficiency is expected due to oxygen evolution. However, it was demonstrated that the \n\nelectrochemical combustion of most of the organic compounds only occurs without the loss of \n\nelectrode activity at anode materials with high overpotential for oxygen evolution [Comninellis, \n\n1994]. \n\nIn this study, the apparent activation energy for the water oxidation at the different materials \n\nwas determined. The electrode materials utilized were the following: \n\nTi/SnO2-Sb2O4 (described in Cir\u00edaco et al., 2011); Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 (described in section 3.2); \n\nTi/Cu/SnO2-Sb2O3 (described in section 3.3; Ti/SnO2-Sb (described in section 3.4; Ti/Pt/SnO2-\n\nSb (described in section 3.5 and Ti/Cu/SnO2-Sb (described in section 3.6). \n\n \n\n4.2.1 Experimental results \n\n \n\nFigure 18, presents the voltammograms of the anodic currents obtained with one set of the five \n\nnew electrode materials prepared in this work, as well as with one electrode material prepared \n\naccording to literature [Santos et al., 2013], for five different temperatures, up to the oxygen \n\nevolution region. Regarding the type of Sn and Sb electrodeposition, simultaneous or alternate, \n\nand the existence or absence of a Pt or Cu interlayer, the following conclusions can be obtained: \n\nthe introduction of a Pt or a Cu metallic interlayer leads to an increase in the current intensity \n\nvalues due to the increase in the conductivity of the substrates Ti/Pt and Ti/Cu relative to the \n\nTi. When the metallic interlayer is the same, the electrodes of the composite material of Sn \n\nand Sb oxides present lower current intensity for equal applied potential, indicating that the \n\npresence of only one predominant phase increases the current intensity. The presence of two \n\ndistinct phases introduces more resistance in the grain boundaries; however, the real surface \n\narea has also an important role in the current intensity. In Figure 18, c and d, it can be observed \n\nthat, simultaneously to the oxygen evolution, Pt can be oxidized, leading to distinct behaviors \n\nin the voltammogram profiles of the platinized and not-platinized electrodes [Wiberg and \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\nArenz, 2012]. In the voltammograms presented in Figure 18, e and f, before oxygen evolution, \n\nan anodic peak can be observed, which can be attributed to the copper oxidation. \n\nTo better visualize the potential window and the relative intensities at the same applied \n\npotential for the different Sn-Sb materials, a comparison of the obtained voltammograms for \n\ndifferent temperatures are 25 and 65 \u00baC is depicted in Figure 19. The highest potential window \n\nis presented by the electrode materials prepared without a metallic interlayer, followed by \n\nthat with a Pt interlayer and finally that with a Cu interlayer. Regarding the preparation mode, \n\nthe simultaneous electrodeposition of Sn and Sb slightly decreases the potential window.     \n\nTo study the mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction on the surface of the different \n\nprepared anodes, steady-state polarization curves were conducted at temperatures ranging \n\nfrom 25 to 65 \u00baC in aqueous 1 M KOH solutions at the anodic potential limit of the \n\nelectrochemical window. This reaction at the Sn-Sb anodes\u2019 surfaces (MOx) can be represented \n\nby the following mechanism [Lyons and Brandon, 2008]: \n\nMOx + OH- ? MOx-OH + e-        (3) \n\nMOx-OH + OH- ?MOx-O- + H2O        (4) \n\nMOx-O- ?MOx-O + e-         (5) \n\n2 MOx-O ? 2 MOx + O2         (6) \n\nwhere equation (3) is the rate determining step.  \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 18. Cyclic voltammograms performed with 1 M KOH solutions at temperatures ranging from 25 to \n65 \u00baC using different electrode materials: (a) Ti/SnO2-Sb; (b) Ti/SnO2-Sb2O4; (c) Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb; (d) \nTi/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4; (e) Ti/Cu/SnO2-Sb; (f) Ti/Cu/SnO2-Sb2O3. Scan rate 0.5 mV s\n\n-1. \n\n \n\nBecause the Tafel plots of log j, where j is the current density, versus the overpotential, ?, \n\npresented two different slopes, one for low overpotential and another for high overpotential, \n\nall of the calculations were made at two different ranges of current density for all of the tested \n\nmaterials and for temperatures ranging from 25 to 65 \u00baC. The corresponding overpotentials for \n\nthe different anode materials, used for the three sets of electrode materials, are presented in \n\nTable 1. This table also contains Tafel slopes and exchange current densities, j0, determined \n\nfrom the Tafel plots for one set of freshly prepared materials at all experimental conditions. \n\nFrom Table 1, it can be seen that j0 and the Tafel slopes are higher for the highest overpotential \n\nregion and for higher temperatures. According to Montilla et al. (2004), the existence of two \n\ndifferent Tafel slopes, for low and high overpotentials, may be related with the change in the \n\nvalence state of the active sites of the anode materials. Thus, the active sites partially \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\ninactivated for low overpotential or lower temperatures can be activated in the high \n\noverpotential region and at higher temperatures [Kibria and Tarafdar, 2002].  \n\n \nFigure 19. Cyclic voltammograms performed with 1 M KOH solutions at different temperatures, for \ndifferent electrode materials. Scan rate 0.5 mV s-1. \n\n \n\nThe anodes that present higher catalytic properties for the oxygen evolution reaction are those \n\nthat present lower overpotential and higher j0. From Figure 19, it can be seen that the anodes \n\nwith better electrocatalytic properties for this reaction are those with a copper interlayer, \n\nfollowed by those with a platinum interlayer. The anodes without a metallic interlayer have \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\nthe poorest electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution. However, the latter are the most \n\nefficient for the oxidation of organic pollutants, with lower energy loss in water electrolysis. \n\nThe Tafel slope depends on the electrodes\u2019 surface characteristics and on the reaction \n\nmechanism. The materials that present higher increases in the Tafel slope between low and \n\nhigh overpotential are those having antimony in the form of Sb(III) and that can be partially \n\noxidized to Sb(V) at higher overpotential, increasing the adsorption of OH-. However, this is not \n\nthe only factor that can affect the Tafel slope because for high roughness factors, an increase \n\nin the active sites can decrease the Tafel slope. When similar anodes prepared by the two \n\ndifferent methods are compared, those presenting higher roughness have lower Tafel slopes. \n\nTo determine the apparent activation energy, log j0 was plotted versus 1/T(K) for the three \n\nsets of the different anode materials at low and high overpotentials. These Arrhenius plots are \n\npresented in Figure 20 for one set of freshly prepared materials. From these Arrhenius plots, \n\napparent activation energies for the oxygen evolution reaction at the Sn-Sb materials, for low \n\nand high overpotentials, were attained and are presented as mean values in Table 2. The \n\napparent activation energies standard errors presented are mainly due to differences between \n\nthe Tafel slopes and the j0 obtained for the two sets of the freshly prepared materials. The \n\napparent activation energies values are distributed into two groups: one that presents values \n\nsimilar to the value reported for the oxygen evolution reaction on Pt in acid medium, 47 kJ mol-1 \n\n[Chernaya et al., 2005], and the other with values higher than 160 kJ mol-1, suggesting that \n\nadsorption on the surface of these latter materials is more difficult to attain. Values higher \n\nthan 47 kJ mol-1 were also obtained by Suffredii et al. (2004) for this reaction at boron-doped \n\ndiamond anodes in acidic media.\n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\nTable 1.

Depending on the preparation method, \n\ndifferent phases were identified by XRD: when the Sn and Sb electrodepositions were \n\nalternated, the formation of distinct SnO2 and Sb2O4 or Sb2O3 phases was observed; for \n\nsimultaneous Sn and Sb electrodepositions, the main phase observed was SnO2. The roughness \n\nof the prepared materials strongly depends on the roughness of the substrate/interlayer and \n\non the thickness of the deposited layer, more than on the deposition method. The material that \n\npresented the highest roughness was Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb prepared over a Pt interlayer with very high \n\nroughness. The roughness deeply influences the oxygen evolution reaction because for equal \n\nsubstrate and interlayer, the material with higher roughness factor presents lower apparent \n\nactivation energy, probably because the higher specific surface favors adsorption and facilitates \n\nthe rate determining step. For some of the prepared materials, namely Ti/SnO2-Sb and \n\nTi/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4, a large difference was observed between the apparent activation energies \n\ncalculated for low and high overpotentials, which is related to the Ti or Pt oxidation that can \n\noccur simultaneously with oxygen evolution. The lowest apparent activation energy for oxygen \n\nevolution was observed for Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb, the material that presented the highest roughness \n\nfactor. The materials containing a copper interlayer presented very similar apparent activation \n\nenergy for the oxygen evolution reaction. These materials also presented the lowest potentials \n\nfor oxygen evolution, in particular the oxide prepared over a Cu interlayer with simultaneous \n\nSn,Sb electrodepositions. Thus, for the tested materials, the most appropriate for oxygen \n\nevolution is Ti/Cu/SnO2-Sb. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\n4.3 Anodic oxidation of diclofenac \n\n \n\nThis subchapter presents the results obtained in a study performed to test Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb as \n\nanode in the electrochemical degradation of a pharmaceutical compound - diclofenac. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nOver the last 15 years, pharmaceuticals have received increasing attention as potential \n\nbioactive chemicals in the environment. They are considered as emerging pollutants in \n\nwaterbodies because they still remain unregulated or are currently undergoing a regularization \n\nprocess, although the directives and legal frameworks are not yet set-up [Sir\u00e9s and Brillas, \n\n2012]. \n\nDrugs are reaching the aquatic environment and, despite their very low concentrations, up \n\nto ?g L-1, presenting a potential hazard for human health, such as the increase of antibiotic-\n\nresistant bacterial infections, especially in locations where advanced wastewater treatments \n\nare not used [Boxall et al., 2003; Chopra et al., 2001; Martinez, 2009]. In fact, there are studies \n\nconcerning the presence of pharmaceutical compounds in the effluents of municipal sewage \n\ntreatment plants [Hirsch et al., 1999; Kolpin et al., 2002; K\u00fcmmerer , 2009].  \n\nThousands of tons of pharmaceutical drugs are consumed yearly worldwide in human and \n\nveterinary medicine and agricultural and consumer products. An important part of these \n\ncompounds enters into the environment from excretion after drug administration to humans \n\nand animals, production sites, direct disposal of excess of drugs in households and treatments \n\nthroughout the water in fish and other animal farms [Brillas et al., 2010]. \n\nDiclofenac (2-[2-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)aminophenyl]acetate ion), commercialized as sodium salt, \n\nis one of the most common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. It is extensively used for \n\ncontrolling renal colic and protecting against recurrent urinary calculi, also being present in \n\nnumerous pharmaceutical formulations to treat various diseases. As a result of its resistance to \n\nbiodegradation, it is one of the most frequently pollutants detected in ground waters, influents \n\nand effluents of sewage treatment plants, rivers and lakes around the world up to contents of \n\n4.4 ?g L-1 [Brillas et al., 2010]. \n\nElectrochemical oxidation treatment is a potential alternative method for eliminating \n\npollutants with good efficiency. However, for the elimination of organic pollutants, it requires \n\nan anode with a high oxygen overpotential, high electrical conductivity and suitable mechanical \n\nand electrochemical stability.  \n\nThe main advantage of the electrochemical technologies is their environmental compatibility \n\nbecause the main reagent, the electron, is a clean reagent. Other advantages include their \n\nversatility, high energy efficiency, amenability to automation, easy handling because of the \n\nsimple equipment required and safety because they operate under mild conditions [Sir\u00e9s and \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\nBrillas, 2012]. Brillas et al. (2010), studied degradation of diclofenac in aqueous medium by \n\nanodic oxidation using an undivided cell with a Pt or BDD anode. It was demonstrated that \n\ndiclofenac was completely depleted by AO with BDD even at the very high concentrations \n\nassessed (175 mg L- 1). Only some carboxylic acids were accumulated in low concentrations and \n\noxalic and oxamic were found to be the most persistent acids.  \n\nIn a previous work [Santos et al., 2013], our group studied the anodic degradation of Diclofenac \n\nwith a Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anode. After an 8 h assay, about 50% of COD and TOC removals were \n\nobserved, with a combustion efficiency of 85% at an applied current density of 30 mA cm-2. \n\n \n\n4.3.2 Electrodegradation assays \n\n \n\nElectrodegradation experiments were conducted in a 250 mL undivided cell using batch mode \n\nwith stirring. The anode was a Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb electrode and the cathode a stainless steel foil, \n\nboth electrodes being 10 cm2 in area and having a 2 cm gap between them. Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb \n\nelectrode was prepared as described in the section 3.5. All anodic oxidation assays were \n\nperformed under galvanostatic conditions with an imposed current density of 30 mA cm?2. The \n\nprocessed solution volume was 200 mL with a diclofenac concentration of 100 mg L-1. Sodium \n\nsulfate aqueous solutions (0.035 M) were used as the supporting electrolyte in all experiments. \n\nAssays were run for 6 h, and data were collected at 1 h intervals.  \n\nDiclofenac degradation was followed by UV-Visible absorption spectrophotometry, with \n\nabsorbance measurements between 200 and 800 nm, and COD and TOC determinations. The \n\nproducts formed during the electrodegradation assays were followed by ion exclusion \n\nchromatography, for the determination of the low molecular carboxilic acids determination. \n\nAssays were also followed by pH and conductivity measurements.  \n\nAll of the assays were repeated twice, and COD and TOC values presented are mean values. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3.3 Results and discussion \n\n \n\nFigure 21 presents the results obtained for the diclofenac electro-oxidation at a Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb \n\nanode. After a 6-h assay, the COD and TOC removals were almost 50% (Figure 21 a and b). The \n\nsimilar reductions in COD and TOC point towards a degradation mechanism of mainly \n\ncombustion rather than conversion. The decay in absorbance, measured at 276 nm (Figure \n\n21 c), where a maximum in the UV-Vis spectrum is observed (Figure 21 d), is slightly lower than \n\nCOD and TOC decays, showing that some of the formed products may present absorbance at \n\nthat wavelength. However, these products must be in low concentration, since the decay in \n\nthe absorbance spectra seems very regular and do not show the formation of new absorbance \n\nbands.  \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nThere is also a decay in the pH (Figure 21 e), which is probably due to the formation of some \n\ncarboxylic acids, well documented in the literature during this type of degradations [Panizza \n\nand Cerisola, 2009]. The slight reduction in the conductivity (Figure 21 e) must be due to the \n\nformation of some polymeric substances that precipitate when the samples are thermostated \n\nat the measuring temperature. \n\n \n\nFigure 21. Evolution in time of (a) COD, (b) TOC, (c) Absorbance, measured at 276 nm, (d) UV-Vis spectra, \n(e) pH and (f) conductivity for the assays performed with Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb electrode at an applied current \ndensity of 30 mA cm-2, using a diclofenac concentration \u2013 100 mg L-1 in sodium sulfate aqueous solutions, \n0.035 M. Inset of (a) \u2013 Diclofenac molecule. \n\n \n\nTo analyze the variation of the mineralization degree during the assays, a plot of TOC vs. COD \n\nis depicted in Figure 22 [Pacheco at al., 2007]. It can be observed that after the first hour there \n\nis a reduction in the ?TOC/?COD slope, showing that the mineralization degree decreases, \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\nprobably due to the formation of some products less easily mineralized than diclofenac. Thus, \n\nthe existence of new products with lower mineralization degree reduces the referred slope. \n\nTo investigate the formation of carboxylic acids, samples collected during the assay were \n\nanalyzed by ion exclusion chromatography, and the results are presented in Figure 23. To better \n\nvisualize in the same figure the plots collected at different times, the HPLC spectrum baseline \n\nwas gradually increased with assay time. In fact, the formation of several different carboxylic \n\nacids can be observed, namely oxamic acid formed from the amino group of the diclofenac \n\nmolecule. Since the carboxylic acid concentrations did not vary significantly during the assay, \n\nit may be concluded that the diclofenac molecule is first broken into small very oxidized \n\nmetabolites, the acids that are then mineralized, keeping acids concentration almost constant. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 22.

In fact, the diclofenac anodic oxidation was successfully attained at this \n\nanode material. After more than 200 working hours, the material presented reproducible \n\nresults, showing that this is a material with potentialities for environmental applications.   \n\nMedium COD and TOC removals, close to 50%, were obtained after 6 h assay. However, in similar \n\nexperimental conditions, COD and TOC removals obtained at a BDD electrode were higher \n\n[Santos et al., 2014b].   \n\nThe similarity between COD and TOC removal rates points to a high degree of mineralization of \n\nthe diclofenac molecule that is corroborated by the gradual decay of the UV-Visible spectra \n\nalong the time. The main by-products identified by ion exclusion chromatography were oxalic, \n\nmaleic and oxamic acids, the last one formed from the amino group of the diclofenac molecule. \n\nVestigial quantities of formic and acetic acids were also found. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\n4.4 Nitrogen and organic load removal from sanitary landfill \n\nleachates by anodic oxidation at Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anodes \n\n \n \nIn this subchapter, the oxidation ability of Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anodes for the treatment of a \n\nbiologically pretreated sanitary landfill leachate is accessed. To understand the elimination of \n\nthe different forms of nitrogen present in the leachate samples, assays were also performed \n\nwith simulated samples, having only different N-containing compounds, without organic \n\nmatter. This work was already published in a scientific journal [Fernandes et al., 2014]. \n\n \n\n4.4.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nRecently, several studies have been reported the application of advanced oxidation \n\ntechnologies for the treatment of sanitary landfill leachates. Landfill leachate is one of the \n\nmajor environmental problems concerning water pollution, and conventional treatments have \n\nbeen inefficient in the treatment of this type of wastewater [Abbas et al., 2009; Eggen et al., \n\n2010; \u00d6man et al., 2008]. Due to its effectiveness and ease of operation, the application of \n\nelectrochemical oxidation to treat these effluents has been studied, with promising results. \n\nThe effect of several operating factors and different types of anode material, in particular \n\nboron-doped diamond (BDD), have been assessed [Anglada et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2010].  \n\nAnglada and co-workers [Anglada et al., 2009; Anglada et al., 2011], reported several studies \n\nconcerning the electrochemical oxidation of landfill leachate using BDD anodes. In these \n\nstudies, the effect of the applied current density, the initial concentration of chloride ions, the \n\ntreatment time and the initial pH were analyzed. They reported that the electro-oxidation \n\nprocess of landfill leachate with BDD anodes is an efficient technology that is able to completely \n\noxidize the organic matter and almost all ammonia under appropriate conditions. Their results \n\nshowed that organic matter and ammonia oxidation are highly influenced by the applied current \n\ndensity, indicating a change in the mechanism of the organic matter oxidation when high \n\ncurrent densities are applied. Moreover, the concentration of chloride has an effect on the \n\noxidation of ammonia, and chloride ions compete with organic matter to be oxidized at the \n\nanode. Similar conclusions were reported by Cabeza et al. (2007 a and b) and Urtiaga et al. \n\n(2012). These authors observed that ammonium oxidation occurs at a slower rate than chemical \n\noxygen demand (COD) decay and that chlorine evolution is enhanced at lower COD values, \n\ncausing the indirect oxidation of ammonium. These authors also observed that when additional \n\nchloride ions were provided, the treatment efficiency increased. \n\nThe formation of inorganic oxidation by-products during the electrocatalytic treatment of \n\nammonium from landfill leachates with BDD anodes was assessed by P\u00e9rez and co-workers \n\n[P\u00e9rez et al., 2012]. It was found that ammonium oxidation leads to the formation of nitrogen \n\ngas and nitrate as the main oxidation products. Higher chloride concentrations have a positive \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\ninfluence on the formation of nitrogen as the main oxidation product. When high chloride \n\nconcentrations (5-20 g L-1) were used in the presence of ammonium, chloride remained almost \n\nconstant because it was regenerated during the indirect oxidation reactions. \n\nOther studies performed with BDD anodes [Fernandes et al., 2012; Fernandes et al., 2013; \n\nUrtiaga et al., 2009; Urtiaga et al., 2012] confirm that the anodic oxidation can be an efficient \n\nalternative/complement to treat sanitary landfill leachates. However, despite these good \n\nresults, BDD anodes present a significant disadvantage: they are expensive. Thus, the use of \n\ndifferent electrode materials that are less costly than BDD for the electrochemical oxidation of \n\nsanitary landfill leachates has been reported by several authors. Cossu et al. (1998) described \n\nthe electrochemical oxidation of a landfill leachate with two different anode materials, Ti/PbO2 \n\nand Ti/SnO2. No significant differences were found in the behaviors of the two anode materials. \n\nAn average current efficiency of 30% was measured for a decrease of COD from 1200 to 150 \n\nmg L-1. The results indicated that the organic load was removed by both direct and indirect \n\noxidation. Indirect oxidation by chlorine or hypochlorite originated from chloride oxidation was \n\nbelieved to be responsible for the nitrogen removal. \n\nThe indirect oxidation effect in the electrochemical oxidation treatment of landfill leachate \n\nusing different anode materials was also studied by Chiang et al. (1995). These authors observed \n\nthat the electrocatalytic behavior of the anode material strongly affects the \n\nchlorine/hypochlorite production efficiency. Moreover, there is a correlation between the COD \n\nremoval efficiency and chlorine/hypochlorite production, and because COD and ammonium \n\nwere removed simultaneously by the indirect oxidation effect during electrolysis, there is a \n\ncompetition between the removal of COD and ammonium.  \n\nPanizza et al. (2010) reported the anodic oxidation of a real leachate using a lead dioxide \n\nanode. The results indicated that the organic compounds were mainly removed by indirect \n\noxidation by the active chlorine generated from chloride oxidation. \n\nA comparative study between different anode materials, including Ti\u2013Ru\u2013Sn ternary oxide, PbO2 \n\nand BDD, for the electrochemical oxidation of a landfill leachate was also performed [Panizza \n\nand Martinez-Huitle, 2013]. The experimental results indicated that after 8 h of electrolysis, \n\nthe Ti-Ru-SnO2 anode yields only 35% COD, 52% color and 65% ammonium removal. Using PbO2, \n\nammonium and color were completely removed, but residual COD was present. On the contrary, \n\nBDD enables complete COD, color and ammonium removal and also exhibits greater current \n\nefficiency along with a significantly lower energy cost compared to the other electrodes. \n\nMost of the PbO2 and SnO2 electrodes implemented in previous studies used a titanium foil \n\nsubstrate that may oxidize during the anodic oxidation of the leachates, leading to the \n\nformation of an insulating titanium oxides layer that inactivates the electrode [Montilla et al., \n\n2004; R\u00edo et al., 2009]. This insulating layer may be avoided by depositing a Pt layer over the \n\ntitanium foil prior to deposition of the metallic oxide [Andrade et al., 2007]. The anode \n\nmaterials thus obtained, Ti/Pt/PbO2 and Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4, have been successfully prepared \n\nand used by our research group in the electrochemical degradation of several pharmaceutical \n\ndrugs [Cir\u00edaco et al., 2009; Santos et al., 2013].  \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\n \n\n4.4.2 Experimental details \n\n \n\n4.4.2.1 Samples preparation and characterization \n\nThe landfill leachate used in this study was collected from the intermunicipal sanitary landfill \n\nfacility of Cova da Beira, Portugal. This site, which serves a population of over 220,000 \n\ninhabitants in 13 municipalities, has an onsite facility capable of treating up to 50 m3 of \n\nleachate daily. The raw leachate was initially treated on site by an activated sludge process. \n\nThe characteristics of the biologically pretreated leachate are presented in Table 3. \n\nSimulated samples were prepared as follows: NH4NO3 - 0.232 g, NH4Cl - 1.605 g, CaCl2 - 0.7 g, \n\nMgCl2.6H2O - 1.42 g, NaCl - 2.472 g and KCl - 2.0986 g and distilled water up to 1 L.   \n\n \nTable 3.

A 10 cm 2 \n\nTi/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 electrode was used as anode, and 10 cm\n2 stainless steel foil was used as \n\ncathode, being the gap between them 2.0 cm. Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 electrode was prepared as \n\ndescribed in the section 3.2 [Santos et al., 2013]. Experiments were conducted at an applied \n\ncurrent intensity of 0.3 A, at room temperature (22-25 \u00baC) without the addition of a background \n\nelectrolyte. A Multimetrix XA 3033 unit was used as the power supply.  \n\nSimulated samples were prepared as follows: NH4NO3 - 0.232 g, NH4Cl - 1.605 g, CaCl2 - 0.7 g, \n\nMgCl2.6H2O - 1.42 g, NaCl - 2.472 g and KCl - 2.0986 g and distilled water up to 1 L.  \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\nAll the electrochemical tests were performed at least in triplicate. The mean values are \n\npresented for the parameters used to follow the assays: COD, DOC, TN, TKN, AN, and chloride, \n\nnitrate and nitrite concentrations. \n\n  \n\n4.4.3 Results and discussion \n\nFigure 24, a and b, presents the results for the variation with time of the normalized COD and \n\nDOC obtained from the experiments performed with Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anode. The variation of \n\nthe normalized COD with electrical energy consumption is also presented (Figure 24 d). It can \n\nbe observed that DOC removal was lower than COD removal. This behavior has been reported \n\npreviously in the literature and has been explained by the formation of low molecular weight \n\norganic compounds with high degrees of oxidation that resist to further oxidation [Anglada et \n\nal., 2009; Fernandes et al., 2012]. The conversion of the organic matter into more oxidized by-\n\nproducts rather than resulting in mineralization promoted by Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anodes must be \n\ndue to the fact that hydroxyl radicals are expected to be strongly adsorbed on the electrode\u2019s \n\nsurface.  \n\nWhen experimental COD evolution with time (Figure 24 c) is compared with the theoretical \n\ntrend Eq. (7) according to the model previously proposed in the literature for electrolysis under \n\ncurrent limited control [Panizza et al., 2001], where I is the current intensity in A, F is the \n\nFaraday constant and V is the volume in m3, it can be seen that the experimental results \n\nobtained for Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 are slightly better. This result is due to the electrocatalytic \n\neffect of the platinum because despite being covered by the metal oxides, platinum peaks are \n\nalways detected by X-ray diffraction [Cir\u00edaco et al., 2009; Santos et al., 2013], probably due to \n\nthe porosity of the oxide film.     \n\n  \n0\n\nI\nCOD(t) COD t\n\n4 F V\n? ?        (7) \n\nWhen the normalized COD is plotted against the electrical energy consumption (Figure 24 d) \n\ncalculated based on the potential difference mean values, which was 6.2 V, an increase in the \n\nenergy consumption with COD decay can be observed. This happens for two main reasons: the \n\neasier degradable compounds goes first, and as the assay proceeds, the effect of mass \n\ntransportation becomes more important, reducing COD removal rate. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 24. Variation with time of the normalized (a) COD and (b) DOC for the anodic oxidation experiments \nperformed with real leachate using a Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anode, (c) comparison of real and theoretical COD \ndecays with time for a 24 h assay and (d) variation of the normalized COD with electrical energy \nconsumption. Error bars refer to the standard deviation of the normalized mean values. \n\n \n\nFigure 25 shows the results obtained for the nitrogen removal in the experiments performed \n\nwith real leachate, where similar TN and TKN decays can be observed. AN removal is more \n\npronounced, especially in the last hours of the assays, showing that Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anodes \n\nare more effective in the removal of the ammonium nitrogen.  \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 25. Variation with time of the normalized TN, TKN and AN for the anodic oxidation experiments \nperformed with real leachate using Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anodes. Error bars refer to the standard deviation \nof the normalized mean values. \n\n \n\nComparing the COD (Figure 24 a) and AN (Figure 25) profiles during the anodic oxidation runs, \n\nAN removal occurs at a slower rate than that of COD during the first 3 hours of the assays. \n\nHowever, when the COD value decreases to approximately 70% of the initial concentration, the \n\nAN removal rate increases. Similar results can be found in the literature. Cossu et al. (1998), \n\nusing a Ti/Pt anode, reported that the removal rate of AN was lower than that of COD at the \n\ninitial stage of electro-oxidation and that AN was substantially removed in the subsequent \n\nelectrochemical oxidation stage when indirect oxidation became prevalent. This increase in \n\nindirect oxidation may be enhanced by the formation of HClO or chlorine from chloride [Anglada \n\net al., 2009; Chiang et al., 1995]. According to Chiang et al. (1995) ammonium reacts with \n\nHClO through the following \u2018\u2018breakpoint reactions\u2019\u2019 that regenerate chloride ions:  \n\nHClO + NH4\n+    ?  NH2Cl + H2O + H\n\n+       (8) \n\nHClO + NH2Cl ? NHCl2 + H2O        (9) \n\nNHCl2 + H2O ? NOH + 2H\n+ + 2Cl-       (10) \n\nNHCl2 + NOH ? N2 + HClO + H\n+ + Cl-       (11) \n\nIn fact, chloride concentration, determined by ionic chromatography, is always higher for the \n\nassays performed with Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anode (Figure 26 a), indicating that this ion may be \n\ninvolved in the oxidation of ammonium and may be regenerated after that process. \n\nAdditionally, this metal oxide anode is very effective in total nitrogen removal, showing that \n\nnitrogen gas is being formed at a high rate, being very effective at partially oxidizing ammonia \n\nto nitrate (Figure 26 b) [Cabeza et al., 2007a]. Regarding nitrites (Figure 26 c), they are \n\ncompletely eliminated during the anodic oxidation. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 26. Variation with time of (a) Cl-, (b) NO3\n\n- and (c) NO2\n- concentrations, determined by ionic \n\nchromatography, for the anodic oxidation experiments performed with real leachate using a Ti/Pt/SnO2-\nSb2O4 anode. (d) Mass balance of the different forms of nitrogen determined in solution during the assays. \nError bars refer to the standard deviation of the mean values.  \n\n \n\nThe mass balance to all nitrogen forms determined during the assays performed with the \n\ndifferent electrode materials is presented in Figure 26 d. A discrepancy is observed only for the \n\nfinal period of the assays, although the zero value is always contained in the interval of the \n\nvalue?SD. \n\nBiochemical oxygen demand after 5 days of incubation was determined for samples obtained \n\nafter 6 h of electrochemical treatment with Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anodes, and a value of 0.40 ? \n\n0.05 g L-1 was obtained. This value led to BOD5/COD ratio of 0.11 ? 0.02, indicating that the \n\nbiodegradability of the samples after 6 h of anodic oxidation did not improve, and was even \n\nslightly worse. This issue occurs because matter that is more difficult to electrolyze is also less \n\nbiodegradable and because the presence of chlorine/hypochlorite may also alter the BOD5 \n\nresults, since these species can deactivate microorganisms responsible for the biodegradation.  \n\nAfter the electrochemical treatment, there were reductions of 42% in the absorbance measured \n\nat 275 nm and reductions of 8.6% in the conductivity for the assays performed with Ti/Pt/SnO2-\n\nSb2O4 anodes. The reduction in the absorbance is due to the removal/degradation of aromatic \n\nstructures by anodic oxidation in materials with high oxygen evolution potentials that produce \n\nhigh concentrations of hydroxyl radicals [Panizza et al., 2001], whereas the decrease in \n\nconductivity is due to metal deposition over the cathode, caused by the cathodic reduction of \n\nthe metal ions present in the leachate samples, and also due to the elimination of other ions, \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\nlike ammonium to give nitrogen gas [Fernandes et al., 2014b]. Regarding the pH variation during \n\nthe assays, it was almost constant, within an acceptable range for experimental error.    \n\nTo understand the effect of organic matter on the elimination of ammonium nitrogen, assays \n\nwere run using simulated solutions containing chloride, nitrates and ammonium in \n\nconcentrations similar to those encountered in the leachate samples. The results are presented \n\nin Figure 27. The elimination rate of chloride is enhanced because there is no competition with \n\nthe organic matter for oxidation. In contrast, hydroxyl radicals are free to convert ammonium, \n\nwhich does not participate in equations (8) to (11) and which does regenerate chloride ions. \n\nAlso, removals in ammonium and total nitrogen are increased and nitrate formation rate is \n\ndecreased, showing that this metal oxide is effective in the complete elimination of nitrogen \n\nfrom solution via the partial oxidation of ammonium to nitrogen. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 27. Variation with time of (a) Cl-, (b) NO3\n-, (c) NH4\n\n+ and (d) TN concentrations for the anodic \noxidation experiments performed with the simulated sample using a Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anode. Error bars \nrefer to the standard deviation of the mean values.  \n\n \n\nAfter the electrochemical treatment performed with this simulated solution, there were \n\nreductions in conductivity of approximately 20% for the assays performed, due to the oxidation \n\nof species with high conductivity, such as ammonium and chloride, and the formation of nitrate, \n\nwhich has lower conductivity than ammonium. The increase in pH (from 6.1 ? 0.1 to 7.5 ? 0.1) \n\nalso contributed to the decrease in conductivity.   \n\n \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\n4.4.4 Conclusions \n\nTi/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anodes, which had already been used with good results in the degradation of \n\npharmaceutical compounds [Cir\u00edaco et al., 2011], prove to be also very effective in the \n\ndegradation of very complex mixtures, such as leachates from sanitary landfills. Its \n\neffectiveness was proved with COD removal rates higher than the theoretical one. Also, it can \n\nbe a good material for the elimination of N-containing compounds, with a good TN removal, \n\nwhich means that part of the nitrogen is eliminated as nitrogen forms. It also promotes \n\nelimination of the organic load by indirect oxidation with chlorine oxidizing species. Although \n\na Pt layer makes the material more expensive than a Ti/SnO2-Sb2O4 anode, and a less efficient \n\nin the COD removal [Santos et al., 2013], it can strategically increase the electrode lifetime; \n\nthe electrodes used in this work were tested for more than 1000 h. \n\nWhen the results of the oxidation ability to remove nitrogen and organic load from biologically \n\npretreated sanitary landfill leachates obtained with Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anodes are compared \n\nwith those from Ti/Pt/PbO2, and BDD [Fernandes et al., 2014a; Fernandes, 2014] the following \n\nconclusions can be drawn: \n\n\u2022 They all present similar COD removal kinetics, although BDD anode promotes the \n\nhighest DOC removal, leading to a higher mineralization degree. This must be due to its inert \n\nsurface where hydroxyl radicals, responsible for the indirect oxidation, are less strongly \n\nadsorbed than at the metal oxides surfaces.  \n\n\u2022 Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 promotes TN and AN removals higher than BDD and lower than \n\nTi/Pt/PbO2. This effect occurs because at metallic oxides, the partial oxidation of ammonium \n\nto nitrogen gas occurs, whereas for BDD, ammonium is oxidized to nitrate. On the other hand, \n\nit shows lower appetency than BDD shows for TKN removal.  \n\n\u2022 Metallic oxide anodes demonstrate low energy consumption because they are more \n\nconductive than BDD and also due to the electrocatalytic effect of the oxides. \n\nThus, Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 can be a good alternative as anode materials for the treatment of \n\nsanitary landfill leachates.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\n4.5 Electrochemical oxidation of humic acid and sanitary \n\nlandfill leachate: Influence of anode material, chloride \n\nconcentration and current density  \n\n \n\nFollowing the study presented in section 4.4 of this thesis, Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 electrode was \n\nutilized to study the influence of the applied current density and of the chloride ion \n\nconcentration on the oxidation of a raw sanitary landfill leachate and, to better understand \n\nthe influence of the experimental conditions on the elimination of organic matter and nitrogen \n\nin the presence of recalcitrant compounds, synthetic samples containing humic acid and \n\ninorganic salts, with COD and ammonium ion contents similar to that of the real leachate, were \n\nalso prepared and subjected to electro-oxidation. Humic acid was chosen to prepare the \n\nsynthetic samples because it has recalcitrant properties and, according to the literature, \n\nsanitary landfill leachates present a high content in humic substances [Bhalla et al., 2013; Foo \n\nand Hameed, 2009; Kang et al., 2002]. Besides humic acid, synthetic samples contained as \n\nnitrogen and chloride sources ammonium sulfate and ammonium chloride.   \n\nThis study was already published in specialized literature [Fernandes et al., 2016].  \n\n \n\n \n\n4.5.1 Introduction \n\nElectrochemical oxidation is the most popular electrochemical procedure for removing organic \n\npollutants from wastewaters (Brillas and Mart\u00ednez-Huitle, 2015) and its application in the \n\ntreatment of complex effluents, such as sanitary landfill leachates, has been reported by \n\nnumerous authors with promising results (Anglada et al., 2009, 2010a, 2010b, 2011; Fernandes \n\net al., 2012, 2014a, 2014b, 2015; Panizza and Martinez-Huitle, 2013; Panizza et al., 2010; P\u00e9rez \n\net al., 2012; Turro et al., 2011; Urtiaga et al., 2012). Since the anode material strongly \n\ninfluences the selectivity and the efficiency of the EO process (Brillas and Mart\u00ednez-Huitle, \n\n2015), different anode materials have been investigated, being the highest organic oxidation \n\nrates and the highest current efficiencies attained with boron-doped diamond electrodes \n\n(Anglada et al., 2009; Fernandes et al., 2015). This is due to the chemical, physical and \n\nelectrochemical outstanding properties of this anode material, when compared with other \n\nconventional electrode materials (Fryda et al., 1999; Panizza and Cerisola, 2005). Removals of \n\n100% in chemical oxygen demand and ammonium nitrogen contents have been achieved for the \n\nEO of sanitary landfill leachates using BDD anodes (Anglada et al., 2010b; Cabeza et al., 2007a, \n\n2007b). However, despite the BDD electrodes exceptional properties and the good results \n\nobtained when this electrode is used, the most common BDD electrodes are Si-supported, which \n\npresent difficulties related to their industrial transposition, due to the fragility and the \n\nrelatively low conductivity of the Si substrate (Brillas and Mart\u00ednez-Huitle, 2015). BDD films \n\nsynthesized on Nb, Ta and W have also shown promising results, but their large-scale utilization \n\nis impossible due to the unacceptably high costs of these metal substrates (Brillas and Mart\u00ednez-\n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n\nHuitle, 2015). Therefore, it is necessary to study the application of new electrode materials \n\nthat can successfully remove the pollutants with lower capital and operational costs. Among \n\nthe different electrode materials studied for the EO process, metal oxides have shown \n\npromising results, even when used to treat complex effluents such as sanitary landfill leachates \n\n(Chiang et al., 1995; Cossu et al., 1998; Feki et al., 2009; Fernandes et al., 2014a; Panizza et \n\nal., 2010; Panizza and Martinez-Huitle, 2013). A study comparing BDD and two different \n\nmetallic oxides anodes, Ti/Pt/PbO2 and Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4, in the EO of a sanitary landfill \n\nleachate showed that metal oxides anodes promoted COD removals similar to that of BDD and \n\nlower energy consumptions, although the difference between the COD and dissolved organic \n\ncarbon removals for BDD was less pronounced than for the other anodes, suggesting that BDD \n\npromotes more easily the complete combustion of the organic matter (Fernandes et al., 2014a). \n\nAlso, regarding nitrogen removal, metal oxide anodes were found to be more effective in the \n\nammonium removal, whereas BDD was more efficient in the organic nitrogen removal \n\n(Fernandes et al., 2014b). In a similar study, Panizza and Martinez-Huitle (2013) compared the \n\nperformance of BDD, PbO2 and Ti-Ru-SnO2 and different results were achieved, since BDD \n\nyielded complete COD, color and AN removal, whereas with PbO2 a residual COD remained and, \n\nwhen Ti-Ru-SnO2 was used, the organic pollutants were only partially oxidized. Also, faster \n\noxidation rate, higher current efficiency and lower specific energy consumption were achieved \n\nusing the BDD anode, resulting, consequently, in lower treatment costs (Panizza and Martinez-\n\nHuitle, 2013). Although the results presented by Fernandes et al. (2014a) and Panizza and \n\nMartinez-Huitle (2013) were different, it must be noticed that whereas the leachate samples \n\nused by the first authors presented COD/AN/chloride concentrations of 6200/480/4700 mg L-1, \n\nthe leachate samples used by the second authors only had 780/266/1800 mg L-1. Also, the lead \n\nand stannous electrodes used by Fernandes et al. (2014a) had a Pt layer between the titanium \n\nfoil and the metallic oxide, which was not the case of the electrode used in the other study. \n\nBesides the anode material, applied current density and chloride ion concentration also have \n\nshown to play an important role in the EO performance. Several authors reported an increase \n\nin COD and AN removals by increasing the applied current density or the chloride ion \n\nconcentration (Anglada et al., 2009, 2011; Bashir et al., 2009; Cabeza et al., 2007a, 2007b; \n\nChiang et al., 1995; Cossu et al., 1998; Feki et al., 2009; Moraes and Bertazzoli, 2005; P\u00e9rez \n\net al., 2012; Turro et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2010, 2011). In a study performed by Anglada et \n\nal. (2009), it was observed that an increase in the current density from 300 to 450 A m-2 scarcely \n\naffected the removal rate of the organic matter, but at higher current densities the oxidation \n\nlevels increased with current density, which suggested a change in the oxidation mechanism of \n\nthe organic matter, since at high current densities mediated electrochemical oxidation \n\nprocesses, such as indirect oxidation by hydroxyl radicals and by other electrogenerated \n\noxidants, had a strong influence. Also, the influence of the applied current density was much \n\nmore significant in the ammonium oxidation than in the COD removal, even if ammonium \n\nremoval occurred at a slower rate than that of COD.  Different results were achieved by Zhang \n\net al. (2010 and 2011) that reported an increase in the COD removal with increasing current \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\ndensity, but only up to a certain value of current density, from which a further increase would \n\nlead to a decrease in the COD removal rate. This behavior was explained by the authors taken \n\ninto account that, at lower current densities, organic matter anodic oxidation with hydroxyl \n\nradicals was favored against chlorine evolution at the anode, and thus the increase in current \n\ndensity would lead to the increase in COD removal rate. However, a further increase in the \n\ncurrent density would enhance chlorine generation and hence the anodic oxidation with \n\nhydroxyl radicals would be depressed. In the meantime, the AN removal would be dominant in \n\nthe competition between AN and COD removal by the indirect oxidation, via active chlorine, \n\nand, consequently, COD removal rate would decrease with current density (Zhang et al., 2010 \n\nand 2011). The effect of the indirect oxidation through chlorine/hypochlorite species in the EO \n\ntreatment of landfill leachates had already been studied by Chiang et al. (1995) that provided \n\nadditional chloride ions to the leachate as supporting electrolyte during the electrolysis. The \n\nexperimental results showed that when 2.5 g L-1 chloride was added, both COD and AN removal \n\nrates increased, being the AN removal rate much higher than that of COD.  \n\nP\u00e9rez et al. (2012) identified nitrogen and nitrate as the main ammonium oxidation products \n\nobtained in the EO of a landfill leachate with a BDD anode: for high chloride concentration, \n\nnitrogen gas was the main product, having the percentage of ammonium transformed into \n\nnitrogen gas increased from 74 to 85%, after 4 hours, when the chloride content was increased \n\nfrom 5 to 20 g L-1, while the percentage of ammonium converted into nitrate varied from 26% \n\nto 15%. Also, the formation of chloramines, chlorate and perchlorate was hindered by increasing \n\nthe initial concentration of chloride ions. \n\nSince the difficulties in treating complex effluents such as landfill leachates is associated to \n\nthe presence of persistent organic pollutants, the oxidation of synthetic wastewaters with \n\ndifferent test substances has been investigated. The electrochemical oxidation of synthetic \n\nsolutions, containing glucose and humic acid using BDD anodes was performed by \n\nWoisetschl\u00e4ger et al. (2013) and the results showed that the degradation process was \n\nincreasingly inhibited by the increase in the amount of humic acid. According to these authors, \n\nduring the electrochemical oxidation, hydroxyl radicals primarily react with organic substances \n\nto form partially oxidized intermediate products and carbon dioxide. Retardation and inhibition \n\nof these reactions due to mass transport limitations or because of the low reactivity of \n\nconstituents will preferably lead to the decomposition of hydroxyl radicals as gaseous oxygen. \n\nAs a consequence, the dissolved oxygen content increases, leading to low current efficiency \n\nand COD removal. \n\n \n\n4.5.2 Experimental details \n\n \n\n4.5.2.1 Sanitary landfill leachate and humic acid synthetic samples \n\nThe landfill leachate samples (L) used in this study were collected from an intermunicipal \n\nsanitary landfill facility in Portugal. This site, with an area of approximately 7 ha, is sealed \n\nsince 2003. The leachate samples were collected in the stabilization lagoon, before any kind of \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\ntreatment, and were kept refrigerated until their use, in order to maintain their initial \n\ncharacteristics. L samples characterization was performed just after the collection and just \n\nbefore their use in experiments and no significant differences on the parameter values were \n\nfound. The characteristics of the landfill leachate are presented in Table 4. No nitrite or nitrate \n\nwere detected in the L samples.  \n\nIn the electrodegradation assays, besides the raw leachate samples, L samples with added \n\nchloride (2 g L-1) were also assayed. \n\nThe synthetic samples (S), were prepared as aqueous solutions of humic acid and inorganic salts \n\npresented COD and NH4\n+ contents similar to the real landfill leachate samples. The inorganic \n\nsalts utilized were ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride and potassium chloride, to provide \n\nthe necessary amounts of ammonium and chloride. Different Cl- contents were tested, from 0 \n\nto 4.5 g L-1. Table 5 summarizes the composition of the different S samples used in the \n\nexperiments and Table 4 presents the physicochemical characteristics of the S samples before \n\nthe chloride addition.  \n\nAll the reagents used were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used \n\nwithout additional purification. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4.

A 10 cm2 \n\nTi/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 plate was used as anode, and 10 cm\n2 stainless steel plate was used as cathode, \n\nwith a 2.0 cm gap between them. Assays were performed with synthetic and real leachate \n\nsamples at applied current densities of 300 and 700 A m-2, using a GW, Lab DC, model GPS-\n\n3030D (0\u201330 V, 0\u20133 A) as power supply. Synthetic and leachate samples with different chloride \n\nconcentrations were assayed. \n\nAll the electrochemical tests were performed at least in duplicate. The mean values are \n\npresented for the parameters used to follow the assays: COD, DOC, TN, TKN, AN, and chloride, \n\nnitrate and nitrite concentrations. \n\n \n\n4.5.3 Results and discussion \n\nFigure 28 present the results for the variation with time of COD and DOC for the experiments \n\nperformed with synthetic and sanitary landfill leachate samples, with different initial Cl- \n\nconcentrations and for the different applied current densities, utilizing as anode material \n\nTi/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4. For L samples, the chloride concentration of 2.5 g L\n-1 corresponds to samples \n\nwhere no chloride was added, since this was the chloride concentration in the raw leachate \n\n(Table 4). \n\n \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 28. Variation with time of the COD (a,b,c) and DOC (d,e,f) removed in the electrodegradation \nexperiments performed with synthetic (S) and leachate (L) samples using Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anode, at two \napplied current densities, 300 and 700 A m-2, and different initial chloride contents.  \n\n \n\nFigure 28, a to c, shows that when S samples were used, for both applied current densities \n\nstudied, the presence of Cl- influenced the COD removal, since in the assays without chloride \n\nCOD removal rate was much lower than for the assays performed with the addition of chloride. \n\nHowever, the increase in chloride initial concentration from 2.5 to 4.5 g L-1 did not introduce \n\nmeaningful changes in the COD removal rates, at both applied current densities, meaning that \n\nthe increment on the chloride concentration did not significantly increase the indirect oxidation \n\nthrough chlorine/hypochlorite. This fact must be related with an optimum COD/[Cl-] ratio, and \n\nan extra addition of chloride does not result in an increase in COD removal rate, because part \n\nof the applied current is spent in the chloride oxidation and intermediate compounds more \n\nresistant to oxidation may also be formed, in particular at low j. In fact, according to the \n\nmedium mass transfer coefficients presented in the literature for leachate samples (Anglada et \n\nal., 2011; Fernandes et al., 2012), the current densities used are lower than the limiting current \n\ndensity for the initial COD value (738 A m-2 &lt; jlim &lt;1156 A m\n-2). Thus, the process is under \n\nkinetic control most of the time, and only when COD removals are high the process becomes \n\ndiffusion controlled. \n\nThe inexistence of a positive effect due to the increase in [Cl-] from 2.5 ad 4.5 g L-1 was also \n\nobserved for the L samples, where the effect of the current density was much more significant \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\nthan the increase in chloride concentration. Regarding the influence of the current density, for \n\nthe assay performed with S samples without chloride, COD removal rate decreased with j. This \n\nbehavior has been reported in the literature and has been explained by the increased \n\nproduction in oxidizing species with the operating current density (Chiang et al., 1995). The \n\nexistence of such species is determinant due to the growing relevance of the diffusional step \n\nwith j. Thus, for [Cl-] = 0 g L-1, the decrease in COD removal with the increase in j may be \n\nrelated with an enhanced oxygen evolution at higher j that may hinder the mass transfer \n\nprocess and the adsorption of the reacting species on the electrode surface. In fact, due to the \n\ninfluence of the platinum interlayer and to the higher porosity of this material, the hydroxyl \n\nradicals, with more expression at higher j, are more strongly adsorbed at the anode surface, \n\nenhancing their decomposition as gaseous oxygen. Regarding the slightly lower COD removal \n\nrate obtained with this material in the treatment of L samples, a similar behavior was also \n\nobserved by Zhang et al. (2010 and 2011), due to an enhancement in the active chlorine \n\ngeneration that reduces the anodic oxidation with hydroxyl radicals. \n\nConcerning DOC removal for S samples, for j = 300 A m-2 (Figure 28d) there is a regular influence \n\nof the chloride initial concentration. This fact is due to the organic matter random oxidation in \n\nthe bulk of the solution promoted by the active chlorine, formed by the chloride oxidation, \n\nthat leads to low mineralization when the chloride initial concentration is low, being more \n\noriented to COD removal. At higher initial chloride concentration, the excess in active chlorine \n\npromotes the compounds complete oxidation, leading to higher mineralization degree. The \n\nincrease in the formation of the active chlorine with chloride initial concentration can be \n\nobserved by the chloride concentration decay during the electrolysis (Figure 29), which \n\nincreases with chloride initial concentration and with applied current density. Although for 700 \n\nA m-2 the differences in the chloride concentration decay still exists, chloride concentration of \n\n2.5 g L-1 must be enough to indirectly oxidize most of the organic matter present in the S \n\nsamples, being the effect of the chloride initial concentration in DOC removal (Figure 28, d to \n\nf) similar to what was observed for the COD removal rate.  \n\nIn the DOC removals in time, for most of the S samples, there are sudden changes in the curves\u2019 \n\nslope. This is due to the formation of a precipitate, associated with a sharp drop in the pH of \n\nthe solution (Figure 30), observed for the assays performed with S samples containing chloride. \n\nThe formation of the precipitate interferes with DOC determination because the samples are \n\nfiltered before analysis. The precipitation occurrence was enhanced by the increase in the Cl- \n\ninitial concentration and applied current density. The reason why the pH drop was only \n\nobserved in the S samples could be the buffer effect caused by carbonate in the leachate \n\nsamples (Chiang et al., 1995). \n\nRegarding DOC removals for L samples (Figure 28, f), it can be observed that the increase in \n\nchloride initial concentration leads to an increase in the mineralization degree, since the effect \n\nof the increase in chloride initial concentration was obvious in the DOC removal and was \n\ninsignificant in the COD removal. \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 29. Variation with time of the chloride concentration during the electrodegradation experiments \nperformed with synthetic (S) and leachate (L) samples using Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anode, at two applied \ncurrent densities, 300 and 700 A m-2, and different initial chloride contents.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 30. Variation with time of the pH value during the electrodegradation experiments performed with \nsynthetic (S) and leachate (L) samples using Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anode, at two applied current densities, \n300 and 700 A m-2, and different initial chloride contents.  \n\n \n\n \n\nWhen the variation of ammonia and total nitrogen forms present in the samples is analyzed \n\n(Figure 31, a to f), at any applied current density, it can be seen that, for S samples without \n\nadded Cl-, no significant removal of the ammonium ion was observed, showing that NH4\n+ removal \n\ntakes place mainly by indirect oxidation through chlorine/hypochlorite species. Another \n\npossible explanation is the formation of small amounts of AN from the oxidation of the low \n\norganic nitrogen content, simultaneously with its consumption to give nitrates (Figure 32). This \n\nbalance could also explain the ammonium ion irregular removal for S samples without added \n\nchloride (Figure 31 a and b). Similar results were found for total nitrogen (Figure 31, d to f), \n\nindicating that TN removal happens also by the indirect oxidation mediated by \n\nchlorine/hypochlorite species.  \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 31. Variation with time of the ammonium ion (a,b,c) and total nitrogen (d,e,f) removed in the \nelectrodegradation experiments performed with synthetic (S) and leachate (L) samples using \nTi/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anode, at two applied current densities, 300 and 700 A m\n\n-2, and different initial chloride \ncontents.  \n\n \n\nFor the S samples with initial addition of chloride and j=300 A m-2, the influence of the initial \n\namount of added chloride, 2.5 or 4.5 g L-1, is very small in the ammonium ion removal (Figure \n\n31 a) and on the nitrate formation (Figure 32 a), but significant on the TN removal (Figure 31 \n\nd). High TN removal was also described by P\u00e9rez et al. (2012), using a BDD anode, during the \n\nelectrochemical oxidation of a landfill leachate. According to these authors, ammonium \n\ndegradation takes place mainly due to the indirect oxidation through chlorine/hypochlorite, \n\naccording to Eq. 12 and 13, being nitrogen gas the main ammonium oxidation product, leading \n\nto a removal in the TN content. \n\n \n\n2/3 NH4\n+ + HOCl ? 1/3 N2 + H2O + 5/3 H\n\n+ + Cl?      (12) \n\nNH4\n+ + 4 HOCl ? NO3\n\n? + H2O + 6 H\n+ + 4 Cl?      (13) \n\n \n\nRegarding the assays performed with L samples, an increase in j increases ammonium ion \n\nremoval (Figure 31 c), TN removal (Figure 31 f) and nitrate formation (Figure 32 c). The effect \n\nof the increase in the chloride content is not so linear, being very small for nitrate formation \n\nand presenting a marked influence in the ammonium ion removal, in particular for the highest \n\napplied j, showing the effect of the indirect oxidation. On the other hand, in TN removal at \n\nhigher j, an increase in the chloride content presents a very clear impact, showing the \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\nimportance of Eq. 12 in the process. For the lowest applied j, however, the increase in chloride \n\ncontent leads to a decrease in TN removal, probably due to lower active chlorine production \n\nat lower electrical current, or due to a competition with the organic matter, since at low j the \n\nincrease in chloride content deeply influences the DOC removal rate (Figure 28 f).     \n\n \n\nFigure 32. Variation with time of the nitrate concentration during the electrodegradation experiments \nperformed with (a,b) synthetic, S, and (c) leachate, L, samples using Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anode, at two \napplied current densities, 300 and 700 A m-2, and different initial chloride contents.  \n \n \n\nIn general, comparing the results obtained for L and S samples, it can be seen that the highest \n\norganic load removals were achieved with S samples, while the highest nitrogen removals were \n\nattained for L samples. These dissimilar results are probably due to the different composition \n\nof the samples, since in the S samples the humic acid was the single source of organic matter, \n\nwhereas L samples contain a lot of different organic compounds, being some of them complex \n\nstructures of humic substances and inorganic ions (Kang et al., 2002), more resistant to \n\noxidation than the humic acid itself. \n\nTo analyze the influence of the chloride concentration on the COD and ammonium ion removals, \n\nthe variations of the COD removed vs. [Cl-]/COD ratio and NH4\n+ removed vs. [Cl-]/[ NH4\n\n+] (Figure \n\n33)  were plotted for the different experimental conditions tested. Regarding the influence of \n\nchloride concentration on the COD removal, it can be seen that the [Cl-]/COD ratio remains \n\nalmost constant, especially for the first hours of the assays, meaning that chlorine/hypochlorite \n\nresulting from the chloride ion oxidation is being consumed proportionally to the oxidation of \n\nthe organic load and indirect oxidation through chlorine/hypochlorite is dominant. A different \n\nbehavior is observed for the NH4\n+ removal, since in L samples an increase of the [Cl-]/[NH4\n\n+] \n\nratio with time is found, whereas in S samples the plots show a general tendency for a decrease \n\nin time of this ratio. This behavior is consistent with the fact that NH4\n+ removal rate is higher \n\nfor L samples than for S samples, being the COD removal rate depressed for L samples and NH4\n+ \n\nremoval rate improved. This shows that indirect oxidation with chlorine/hypochlorite is even \n\nmore important in the NH4\n+ elimination than in the COD removal and that increasing Cl- initial \n\nconcentration without using an adequate j may lead to higher [Cl-] in the final samples with \n\nonly a small increase in the NH4\n+ removal.   \n\n \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\n  \nFigure 33.

The lowest energy consumptions were achieved in assays performed \n\nat j = 300 A m-2 with [Cl-]0 = 4.5 g L\n-1, and the highest consumptions were attained for j = 700 \n\nA m-2 and [Cl-]0 = 2.5 g L\n-1. These results were expected since the increase in chloride ion \n\nconcentration increases the electric conductivity of the sample, and consequently the cell \n\nvoltage decreases. On the other hand, an increase in j leads to a decrease in current efficiency. \n\nAmong the anode materials studied, PbO2 showed the lowest energy consumptions for j = 300 \n\nA m-2 and [Cl-]0 = 4.5 g L\n-1. \n\nRegarding the possible leaching of heavy metals from the anode material, when metal oxide \n\nanodes are used, results from previous studies have shown that metal content in the \n\nelectrolyzed solutions is negligible, either because anodes are mechanically stable (Cir\u00edaco et \n\nal., 2009) or the metal ions in samples are removed by cathodic reduction, during the \n\nelectrodegradation assays (Fernandes et al., 2014b). \n\n\n\n68 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 6.

The increase \n\nof current density has also a positive effect on the COD removal rate. The indirect oxidation \n\nthrough chlorine/hypochlorite is dominant on the electrooxidation process, being more \n\nrelevant in leachate samples and for NH4\n+ elimination. However, depending on the applied \n\ncurrent density, an increase in the Cl- initial concentration may lead to higher [Cl-] in the final \n\nsamples, without a significant increase in the COD and NH4\n+ removal. \n\nThe results obtained for L and S samples, regarding the removals of organic load and nitrogen, \n\nare not coincident, probably due to the different recalcitrance of both samples. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\n5. Conclusions \n\n \n\nThe main goal of this thesis was to search for an efficient tin and antimony mixed oxide to be \n\nutilized as anode and to find suitable and low-cost electrochemical solutions for oxygen evolution \n\nand degradation of organic pollutants, and refractory wastewaters. The above presented results \n\nshow that this objective was achieved. In the next paragraphs this subject will be discussed in \n\nmore detail.  \n\n  \n\nConcluding remarks \n\n \n\nTo attain the main objectives, secondary goals were established and experimental work was \n\ndeveloped to achieve the proposed objectives. In the presentation of the experimental results \n\nthe main conclusions were already drawn for each of the different studies performed. Based \n\non those conclusions, an evaluation of the obtained results according to the proposed objectives \n\nis presented in this chapter.  \n\nFirst objective: To prepare tin and antimony mixed oxides materials that are structural, \n\nchemical, mechanical and electrochemically stables. \n\nThis goal was accomplished, and five different new materials were prepared by two different \n\npreparation methods. Two different Sn-Sb mixed oxides were prepared, over a Ti/Pt and Ti/Cu \n\n,substrate, by the alternate electrodeposition technique, Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 and Ti/Cu/SnO2-\n\nSb2O3. To obtain thinner and uniform films, Sn-Sb oxide materials were prepared using the \n\nsimultaneous deposition of the metals over several different substrates, namely Ti, Ti/Pt and \n\nTi/Cu, to obtain the anodes Ti/SnO2-Sb, Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb and Ti/Cu/SnO2-Sb.  All the mixed oxides \n\nprepared were structural, morphological and electrochemically characterized by, respectively, \n\nXRD, SEM and CV.   \n\nIn the simultaneous electrodeposition only one oxide phase was identified, SnO2, being the \n\nantimony present in an intermetallic SbSn phase; in the alternate deposition, two oxide phases \n\nare obtained, SnO2 and Sb2O4 or Sb2O3.  \n\nThe introduction of a Pt or Cu interlayer increased surface\u2019s roughness, particularly in the case \n\nof the Pt layer, being the highest relative roughness presented by Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb. Apparently, \n\nrelative roughness depends on the substrate morphology, as well as on the electrodeposition \n\nprocess and probably also on the film thickness. However, it is difficult to show a linear \n\ncorrelation between preparation method and roughness. \n\n \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\nSecond objective: To obtain tin and antimony mixed oxides materials with extended lifetime, \n\nsuitable to be used in the degradation of organic pollutants or in the oxygen evolution reactions. \n\nThis goal was accomplished. Regarding the lifetime of anodes, the electrodes with platinium \n\ninterlayer have the best performance. The lifetime of the anodes prepared without interlayer \n\nis shorter when compared with that of Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 and Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb. However the \n\nmaterials without a Pt interlayer are the best for direct oxidation of pollutants, as they present \n\nthe largest potential window for oxygen evolution.  \n\nFrom the prepared oxides, those with a copper interlayer presented the lowest potentials for \n\noxygen evolution, being the most appropriate for oxygen production. On the other hand, they \n\nare less stable towards oxidative potentials, being unsuitable as anodes for the \n\nelectrodegradation of organic pollutants. In fact, in the presence of sulfate, the copper layer \n\noxidizes, resulting in the formation of copper sulfate.  \n\nThe roughness deeply influences the oxygen evolution reaction since for equal substrate and \n\ninterlayer, the material with higher roughness factor (Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb prepared over a Pt \n\ninterlayer) presents lower apparent activation energy, probably because the higher specific \n\nsurface favors adsorption and facilitates the rate determining step. \n\nThird objective: To find correlations between the preparation method and the abilities of the \n\nprepared material for the different possible applications, namely degradation of organic \n\npollutants or oxygen evolution reactions. \n\nApparently, the correlation between the preparation method and the oxidizing abilities of the \n\nprepared material lies essentially on the existence or not of an interlayer and on the type of \n\ninterlayer, since: \n\n\u2013 The inexistence of an interlayer between the titanium plate and the mixed oxide layer \npromotes the formation of a passivating TiO2 film that deeply reduces the lifetime of \n\nthe electrode; \n\n\u2013 A copper interlayer is not appropriate for the utilization of the electrode at high \npotentials, since copper oxidizes and disables the electrode;  \n\n\u2013 A platinum interlayer confers extended lifetime to the electrode, but reduces the \nelectrodegradation rate of organic compounds, due to the platinum catalytic effect \n\nthat promotes the reaction at the electrode\u2019s surface, reducing the ability of the \n\nhydroxyl radicals for indirect oxidation.  \n\n   \n\nFourth objective: To find, among all the prepared materials which is the most appropriate to \n\nbe used as anode in the degradation of different types of pollutants. \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\nFrom the discussion presented above, the most suitable materials to be used as anode in the \n\ndegradation of organic pollutants are those with a platinum interlayer. In fact, although they \n\nhave a more expensive preparation, due to the platinization, they present an outstanding \n\nservice lifetime, with oxidation abilities similar to those presented by boron-doped diamond \n\nand lead oxide. Moreover, this electrode material, along with Ti/Pt/PbO2, presents higher \n\nability for nitrogen elimination as gaseous forms and lower energy consumption than BDD, even \n\nin the treatment of sanitary landfill leachates and humic substances. \n\n \n\n \n\nFuture trends \n\n \n\nElectrodes with platinium interlayer have proved to be electrochemical and mechanically \n\nstable. However, the introduction of a Pt layer increases their cost. Thus, to reduce the \n\npreparation costs, Pt must be substituted by a cheaper metal that also avoids the formation of \n\nan insulating TiO2 interlayer. Thus, other substrates, such as titanium nanotubes, carbon \n\nnanotubes, niobium, should be tested. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n72 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nAbbas, A.; Jingsong, G.; Ping, L.; Ya, P.; Al-Rebaki, W.; Review on Landfill Leachate \n\nTreatments; Journal of Applied Sciences Research (2009); 5; 534. \n\n \n\nAmjoud, M.; Maury, F.; Soukane, S.; Duverneuil, P.; Making of specific electrodes by CVD; \n\nSurface and Coatings Technology (1998);  100-101; 169. \n\n \n\nAndrade, L.; Rocha-Filho, R.; Bocchi, N.; Biaggio, S.; Study of the effect of precursor salts on \n\nthe electrocatalytic properties of Ti-SnO2/Sb electrodes prepared by thermal decomposition; \n\nQuimica Nova (2004); 27; 866. \n\n \n\nAndrade, L.; Rutuolo, L.; Rocha-Filho, R.; Bocchi, N.; Biaggio, B.; Iniesta, J.; Garcia-Garcia, \n\nV.; Montiel, V.; On the performance of Fe and Fe, F doped Ti\u2013Pt/PbO2 electrodes in the \n\nelectrooxidation of the Blue Reactive 19 dye in simulated textile wastewater; Chemosphere \n\n(2007); 66; 2035. \n\n \n\nAnglada, A.; Urtiaga, A.; Ortiz, I.;  Pilot scale performance of the electro-oxidation of landfill \n\nleachate at boron-doped diamond anodes; Environmental science and technology (2009); 43; \n\n2035. \n\n \n\nAnglada, A.; Ortiz, D.; Urtiaga, A.; Ortiz, I.; Electrochemical oxidation of landfill leachates at \n\npilot scale: evaluation of energy needs; Water Science and Technology (2010a); 61; 2211. \n\n \n\nAnglada, A.; Urtiaga, A.; Ortiz, I.; Laboratory and pilot plant scale study on the electrochemical \n\noxidation of landfill leachate;  Journal of Hazardous Materials (2010b); 181; 729. \n\n \n\nAnglada, A.; Urtiaga, A.; Ortiz, I.;  Mantzavinos, D.; Diamadopoulos, E.; Boron-doped diamond \n\nanodic treatment of landfill leachate: evaluation of operating variables and formation of \n\noxidation by-products; Water Research (2011); 45; 828. \n\n \n\nArmenta-Armenta, M. and Diaz, A.; Oxidation of benzoic acid by electrochemically generated \n\nCe (IV); Environmental Science and Technology (2005); 39; 5872.  \n\n \n\nBarrocas, B.;  Monteiro, O.;  Melo  Jorge, M.
