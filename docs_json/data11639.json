However, hydrogeomorphic \ncharacteristics of  mountain rivers are not fully understood. In this context, the present paper aimed to identify relevant parameters \nfor characterizing rivers in these environments based on bibliographical review. It was identified which parameters have been used and \nhow they have been used to characterize mountain rivers in distinct classifications. The most cited parameters were channel gradient, \nrelation between river width and depth, entrenchment ratio, discharge, sediment transport and grain-size distribution. Also, the current \nsituation related to researches in fluvial geomorphology in mountain rivers in Brazil was evaluated, and the strong need of  field survey \nas basis for the best understanding of  mountain fluvial dynamics and characterization was verified.\n\nKeywords: Fluvial characterization; Mountain environment; Hydrogeomorphology.\n\nRESUMO\n\nRios montanhosos est\u00e3o presentes em uma grande por\u00e7\u00e3o dos territ\u00f3rios do planeta, especialmente nas regi\u00f5es de cabeceiras, e v\u00eam \nsendo utilizados para diversos fins, tais como recrea\u00e7\u00e3o e atividades desportivas, mananciais de \u00e1gua e gera\u00e7\u00e3o de energia hidrel\u00e9trica. \nEntretanto, suas caracter\u00edsticas hidrogeomorfol\u00f3gicas ainda n\u00e3o s\u00e3o plenamente conhecidas.

According to Faria (2005), it is \nconvenient to classify the mountains by its height which can be \ndefined as the vertical distance between their basis and summit, \nand to consider the mountains as the environments whose height \nis more than 300 m.\n\nAs reported by Wohl (2010), mountain rivers show typical \ncharacteristics such as high slope, high oscillation between minimum \nand maximum discharges, high mobility of  bedload sediments, \ncountless transitions between sub and supercritical flow, limited \nsupply of  fine sediments, large variation in channel geometry \nassociated to sediment supply, debris flow occurrences and high \nchannel entrenchment ratio. Fryirs et al. (2007) commented that \nin mountain rivers the water and sediment move quickly in the \ncatchment, accomplishing hydrogeomorphic processes more \nextremely.\n\nIn Brazil, although mountain rivers have been used for \ndifferent purposes (tourism, recreation, hydroelectric energy, etc.), \nthere are still a few studies about them and theirs characteristics \n(for example, FARIA; MARQUES, 1998; FARIA, 2000, 2005, \n2014). According to Kobiyama et al. (2006, 2018), the occupation \nand use of  mountain catchments have been intensified. Such \nrequests occur exactly where the hydrogeomorphic processes are \nmore intense and still less studied.\n\nTherefore, the objective of  the present study was to evaluate \nthe relevant parameters for characterizing mountain rivers, as well \nas dealing with their measurement, limitation, difficulties and \nproblems. Thus, it was sought to discuss the characterization of  \nmountain rivers to the Brazilian community which is still lacking \nin these studies.\n\nRIVER CLASSIFICATIONS\n\nSeveral authors have been proposing different approaches \nfor classifying rivers: (i) channel orders; (ii) process domains, \nwhere the physical processes occurring in rivers are considered; \n(iii) fluvial channel patterns; (iv) interactions between channel \nand floodplain; (v) mobility and bed material; (vi) channel units; \n(vii) hierarchical classifications; and (viii) statistical classifications. \nThe use of  distinct classifications is conditioned basically with \nthe analysis purpose, i.e., the degree of  detail and the objective.\n\nClassifications based on channel order (HORTON, 1945; \nSTRAHLER, 1957) or on its magnitude (SHREVE, 1966) offer \nfew information about channel morphology. However, they \nemphasize the structure of  the drainage network, and describe \nthe size and the relative location of  channels in a catchment. \nWohl (2000) commented that the majority of  mountain rivers do \nnot have or have a few tributaries, being normally up to second \norder. However, some rivers in mountain environments in Brazil \n\ncould be up to fourth order, in regions as Serra do Mar, Serra da \nMantiqueira, Serra do Capara\u00f3 and some regions of  Atlantic Forest.\n\nClassifications based on physical processes that occur in \nrivers (SCHUMM, 1977; ROSGEN, 1994; MONTGOMERY; \nBUFFINGTON, 1997, and so on) used to divide them into \nsediments\u2019 production or source, transfer or transport, deposition \nor river response to sediment zones. Montgomery (1999) developed \nthe concept of  process domains, i.e., portions of  the fluvial \nnetwork characterized by specific interrelated set of  processes \nand disturbances, channel morphologies and aquatic habitats that \ncorrespond approximately to sediment production, transport and \ndeposition zones. In addition, the rivers classification based on \nthe process domains identifies fundamental geomorphic units in \nthe landscape that structures the river behavior.\n\nAnother way is from pattern analysis of  fluvial channels \n(LANE, 1957; ROSGEN, 1994; BRIERLEY; FRYIRS, 2005) where \nthe studies are based on continuity of  determined pattern and deal \nwith the factors (sediment size, bedload transport, roughness, width \nand depth of  channels) that change these patterns. The factors \ncan be also slope, specific energy, relation between width and \ndepth, capacity and competence of  bedload material. Approaches \nderived from Schumm (1977) provide good conceptual models \nthat assist to recognize also the channel morphology and their \nresponses to disturbances in discharge and sediment supply, and \ninclude morphologies that are presented in mountain rivers, for \nexample, Church (1992, 2006).\n\nThe interactions between channels and floodplains \n(STEVENS; SIMONS; RICHARDSON, 1975) aimed to identify \nthe controls of  the physical and morphological processes both for \nrivers and plain. They are not associated to mountain rivers once \ntheir analyses focus on plains. This kind of  classification aims to \ndescribe long-term process in channels, especially the plain rivers.\n\nWhen classifying rivers due to sediment mobility and \nbed material (BUFFINGTON, 2012; CHURCH, 2006), they are \ndivided according its substrate, if  they are alluvial fans or gravel \nbedload channels. Montgomery et al. (1996) proposed that gravel \nbedload channels occur where the sediments transport capacity \nexceeds their supply, meanwhile alluvial rivers occur where the \nsediment supply corresponds or exceeds the transport capacity. \nBenda (1990) commented that gravel bedload rivers also can \noccur in reaches which had a debris flow occurrence and which \ndo not necessarily have fluvial characteristics. Church (2002, 2006) \npresented a refined scale for classifying bedload mobility defined \nin terms of  Shields critical stress, where sediment size, transport \nregime, channel morphology and stability are related. Whiting and \nBradley (1993) proposed a classification for mobility of  headwaters \nrivers from mechanics equations, considering the potential loss \nof  mass in the adjacent hillslope, the mode of  transport and the \nchannel competence for moving the deposited material and if  the \nsediment pulse is deposited in the river or not. This classification \nis particularly attractive, because it is strongly based on processes \nand allows quantifying the disturbance risk to the fluvial system \nand their potential to response to it.\n\nClassifications based on channel units (BISSON et al., 1982; \nMONTGOMERY; BUFFINGTON, 1997; ZIMMERMANN; \nCHURCH, 2001; BUFFINGTON et al., 2002, 2009) evaluate the \nmorphological units encountered in reaches such as pools, bars, \n\n\n\nRBRH, Porto Alegre, v. 24, e10, 2019\n\nPaix\u00e3o and Kobiyama\n\n3/13\n\nsteps and riffles. These units also form structures in blocks of  large \nmorphological reaches as step-pools, riffle-pools and cascades.\n\nSeveral studies tried to understand the hydraulics in these \ntypes of  units as well as their physical and biological characteristics \nin steep channels (e.g., GRANT; SWANSON; WOLMAN, 1990; \nZIMMERMANN; CHURCH, 2001; HALWAS; CHURCH; \nRICHARDSON, 2005). Since they are characteristics observed in \nsmall reaches of  the rivers, Montgomery and Buffington (1997) \ncommented that these classifications are over detailed for major \napplications in catchment scale and that it causes some difficulties \nto investigate the mechanics of  pluvial processes. However, they \nare extremely important concerning steep rivers (MOIR et al., \n2009), i.e., mountain rivers.\n\nConsidering hierarchical classifications (FRISSELL et al., \n1986; BUFFINGTON et al., 2003; CHURCH, 2006), the river \nnetwork can be divided into homogeneous reaches based on \nchannel patterns, so that the morphology and channel conditions \nare evaluated in detail at different scales. The analysis is performed \nin catchment level, acting in successive scales of  physical and \nbiological conditions, which allows a holistic approach. Historically, \nhierarchical classifications have been developed emphasizing \nmountain rivers (BUFFINGTON; MONTGOMERY, 2013). \nHowever, the process domains are still not well explained. Figure 1 \nshows a scheme of  hierarchical classifications.\n\nFurther more, there is a statistical classification \n(THOMPSON et al., 2006) whose main objective is to predict \nmorphological channel characteristics from spatial statistics \nfor classifying reaches based on distinct bedload topographies. \nIn this case it is important to identify spatial patterns that could \nbe replicated in channels with similar architectures.\n\nAccording to Buffington and Montgomery (2013), the use \nof  one classification to the detriment of  another can be related to \n\nadvances in science and regional needs, as well as the purpose or \nphilosophy behind classification. Currently, hierarchical classifications \nare in vogue because they approach the need in holistic studies \ncovering the whole catchment and also physical and biological \nprocesses on different scales besides being developed for mountain \nrivers. However, a common mistake that river classifiers take is \nthe indiscriminate use of  some processes described by an author \nwithout appropriate field survey that corroborate these arguments. \nAs these hierarchical classifications were established specifically \nfor mountain rivers, the present study adopted them.\n\nMOUNTAIN RIVERS\n\nIn her book entitled \u201cMountain Rivers Revisited\u201d, \nWohl (2010) commented that the most consistent characteristics \nof  mountain rivers may be their high slope. However, the author \nconfirmed that this characteristic is strongly related to others such \nas limitation of  channels resistant to erosion and hydraulically \nroughness associated to gravel bedload sediments, highly-turbulent \nflow with large variations between critical and supercritical \nflow, high spatio-temporal variability of  bedload material, high \nlongitudinal variation in channel geometry, high entrenchment \nratio, among others.\n\nMountain rivers that are present in headwaters regions are \nsubject to geomorphic alterations in time and space. According  to \nSklar and Dietrich (1998), these alterations include process transition \nfrom hillslope to channel as well as transitions from bedrock to \ngravel bedload or from gravel bedload to sand bedload.\n\nDue to the facts that the river characteristics are not \ncontinuous in its extension and also that the river shows geomorphic \nalterations in time and space, it is very important to identify the \nplaces where these characteristics suffer from changes. In other \n\nFigure 1. Hierarchical classification of  river. Source: Frissell et al. (1986).\n\n\n\nRBRH, Porto Alegre, v. 24, e10, 2019\n\nRelevant parameters for characterizing mountain rivers: a review\n\n4/13\n\nwords, a part of  the river can be considered as mountainous \nmeanwhile another as alluvial.\n\nLin and Oguchi (2009) evaluated longitudinal and \ntransversal profiles in rivers over one mountainous catchment, and \ndemonstrated that topographic characteristics present different \nlevels of  organization between steeper and flatter regions. According \nto them, meanwhile the global gradient of  the catchment is \ndetermined by the longitudinal inclination, the transversal slope \nplays an important role in less steep areas, which evidences the \nneed to evaluate the channel steepness in field.\n\nOhmori and Shimazu (1994) analyzed different hazard \ntypes (debris flow, turbidity flow and floods) in mountain rivers \nand their relations with geomorphic parameters. The authors \nreported that these different types can occur in distinct locations \nof  channels, depending upon the channel steepness in a reach.\n\nBuffington and Montgomery (2013) commented that, due \nto the fact that river classifications are extremely qualitative, the \ncharacterization of  fluvial environments is still quite empirical \nand, thus, measuring mountain rivers remain still a hard task.\n\nBased on an analysis of  different classifications, the most \ncommonly used and most useful parameters related to rivers in \nmountain environments are identified (Table 1). The channel \ngradient, width, depth, entrenchment ratio, discharge, sediment \nload and grain size are commonly used regardless of  the type \nof  river classification. Next, these relevant parameters will be \ndiscussed by considering mountain environments.\n\nRELEVANT PARAMETERS\n\nChannel gradient\n\nAs mentioned above, the channel gradient is, probably, \nthe most consistent parameter in the mountain rivers analysis \n(WOHL, 2010). It affects hydraulic process of  discharge and \nsediment transport, and is related with other characteristics such \nas occurrence of  channel units and alteration in flow regime.\n\nMoreover, the utilization of  the unique value for channel \ngradient causes to subestimate hydrogeomorphic processes that \n\nTable 1.

Therefore, the utilization of  hierarchical \nclassifications in different scales for characterizing mountain \nrivers is suggested.\n\nMountain rivers englobe transitions in channel patterns, i.e., \nthe transitions between bedrock and gravel or between gravel and \nsand bed (SKLAR; DIETRICH, 1998). As a sediment transport is \nrelated to channel gradient, one of  the main proposals is to verify \nits condition where the patterns\u00b4 changes occur. Wohl, Vincent and \nMerritts (1993) described in detail channel units characteristics, and \nverified that in the gradients over 0.002 m/m it can be possible \nto observe this kind of  change in morphology. Several studies \nabout channel gradient in mountain areas (LENZI, 2001; MAO; \nCOMITI; LENZI, 2010; BUCKRELL, 2015) demonstrated that \nthe gradient in mountains is usually with magnitude of  cm/m \nmeanwhile floodplain environments with magnitude of  cm/km \n(LEFAVOUR; ALSDORF, 2005).\n\nThe ways to measure channel gradient depend on the scale \nrequired in the analysis: river, segment, reach of  channel units \nwhich are all demonstrated in Figure 1. For a river scale, remote \nsensing and geoprocessing from Digital Elevation Model (DEM) \nwith good resolution (for example, 1:50,000) can be used. For a \nsegment scale which has its magnitude of  102 m (FRISSELL et al., \n1986), both DEM with appropriated resolution and topographic \nand topobathymetric data can be used.\n\nAn analysis of  reach (101 m) and channel units (100 m) requires \nfield survey with total station, differential GPS topographical level \nand/or drones in order to obtain topographic and topobathymetric \n\ndata (Figure 2a). According to Arroyo et al. (2010), the utilization \nof  LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) allows obtaining \ninformation from the terrain with 50-cm resolution. In the case \nof  the step-pool morphology analysis, the gradient value depends \non the step approach. In other words, different ways to measure \nin field generate different values of  gradient. For example, the \nmeasurement can be performed from the beginning of  the \nupstream pool to the end of  the downstream pool (?\n\nAD\n) or from \n\nthe upstream step to the downstream step (?\nBC\n\n) (Figure 3).\n\nRelation between river width and depth\n\nMorphometric parameters as width and depth are \ncommonly required for characterizing mountain rivers, especially its \nwidth/depth relation. According to Rosgen (1994) Classification, \nthe value of  this relation must be lower than 12 for river types \nAa+, A, B, F and G which indicate the mountain rivers in his \nClassification due to channel slope and geometric plain view \ncriteria. It should be here mentioned that Rosgen Classification \ndoes not refers directly to mountain rivers, although the proposal \nindex shows similarities that allow them to be classified in the \nprevious mentioned classifications.\n\nIn general, these parameters are not easily obtained with \nremote sensing techniques. The river width, however, can be \nmeasured with images from a reasonable number of  pixels, once \nthe pixel resolution may cause measurement errors. In mountain \nenvironments, the grid resolution from an image is very commonly \n\nFigure 2. Field survey and measurement: (a) morphometric parameters by using total station; and (b) discharge by using ADCP. \nSource: Elaborated by the author.\n\n\n\nRBRH, Porto Alegre, v. 24, e10, 2019\n\nRelevant parameters for characterizing mountain rivers: a review\n\n6/13\n\nlarger than river\u2019s dimensions, which makes the obtention of  \nmorphometric parameters from remote sensing techniques \nimpossible. In this case, field survey becomes indispensable.\n\nThus, the obtention of  parameters as width and depth in \nreach scale should be performed by using a total station and a \nmeasuring tape. In this way, these parameters can be measured \ntogether with the channel gradient. Hence, the importance of  \nhydrometry and topo-bathymetry in field survey increases.\n\nEntrenchment ratio\n\nEntrenchment ratio of  a river indicates how it is excavated \nin the landscape (ROSGEN, 1994), i.e., how the river is limited \nlaterally by banks and hillslopes. It is related to vertical contention \nof  rivers, and allows making some inferences about the channel\u2019s \nadjacent area. The entrenchment ratio is determined by the relation \nbetween flood prone areas and channel width. The flood prone \narea is estimated as the width measured for the river elevation \ncorresponding to the double of  maximum river depth for a \nspecific cross section.\n\nTherefore, obtaining the entrenchment ratio requires \nknowing the river depth and the flood prone area in the study \nsite. These data come from detailed field survey by using total \nstation and measuring tapes. In case the mean depth is known and \na DEM with good resolution is available, the measurement of  the \nflood prone area could be estimated by Geographical Information \nSystem (GIS) techniques.\n\nRosgen (1994) showed various examples of  the typical \nentrenchment ratio. Thereby, this parameter can be estimated from \ncomparison between typical values showed in Rosgen analysis and \nstudy site, emphasizing that mountain rivers should be classified \nas Aa+, A, B, F or G. On the other hand, non-mountain rivers \npresent high values of  this parameter. It means that they do not \nhave significant lateral control of  the margins and banks, allowing \nthe large spread of  channel and the connection among rivers, lakes \nand meanders during flood events.\n\nDischarge\n\nIt is almost impossible to perform traditional methods \nfor measuring discharge in mountain rivers during flood events \ndue to its high velocity and sediment mobility (CHEN, 2013). \nIn  addition, discharges during floods could change very quickly \nin short time, making it indispensable to perform the measure as \nfast as possible. This temporal variation must be a characteristic \nof  mountain rivers.\n\nIn mountain rivers the time of  concentration used to be very \nshort, of  magnitude from a few minutes to one hour, which still \nmakes it difficult to perform systematical discharge measurements \nfor covering all the flood events. Because of  its short time of  \nconcentration, the floods in mountain rivers are considered as \nflash floods (KOBIYAMA; GOERL, 2007). Furthermore, as the \nresponse time is very short, the field surveys have been frequently \ncombined with extreme rainfalls. This fact also increases difficulty \nin measurements.\n\nTherefore, the use of  ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current \nProfiler) (Figure 2b) is strongly recommended to measure discharges \nin mountain rivers. This use allows obtaining the relation between \nvelocities and areas in a more reliable way than traditional methods \nduring flood events. In addition, the use of  ADCP allows performing \nthe measurement quickly than traditional methods (GAMARRO, \n2012). However, mountain rivers used to present low depths, \nwhich can cause some difficulties to perform the measurement. \nTherefore, it is necessary to look for an appropriated transect \nthat at least has the minimum depth for the ADCP use and also \nprovides a security for the field workers.\n\nIt is important to highlight that for non-mountain rivers \nit is not difficult to apply the traditional methods with a propeller \ncurrent meter or ADCP, as described in the technical report of  \nlarge rivers discharge measurements (ANA, 2014). Also, the \nutilization of  satellites images can be used for estimating discharges \nat a cross section of  an alluvial river. LeFavour and Alsdorf  \n(2005) demonstrated the possibility to estimate discharges in a \nriver belonging to the Amazon region with the remote sensing. \nThe authors commented that bathymetry was the unique parameter \n\nFigure 3. Step-pool sequences with different gradients that can be obtained from the same channel unit.\n\n\n\nRBRH, Porto Alegre, v. 24, e10, 2019\n\nPaix\u00e3o and Kobiyama\n\n7/13\n\nthat could not be obtained by image, however, due to a very large \nriver whose other parameters could be estimated, the bathymetry \ncould be neglected since the calibration process used a well-known \nriver gauge station.\n\nIn this way, it is highlighted that water discharge measurements \nin mountain and alluvial rivers are obtained by different ways. \nThe present study, therefore, emphasizes that both methods and \ntemporal changes are important items in river classification, once \nmountain and alluvial rivers differs consistently in these subjects.\n\nSediment load\n\nThe sediment transport in mountain rivers is one of  the \nparameters that have the most uncertainty in their values. According \nto Brardinoni et al. (2015), the sediment dynamics in mountain \nrivers depends on a series of  complex interactions among river \ndischarge, activation of  sediment sources from different types, \nand river morphodynamics.\n\nSediment load has large uncertainty associated to its \nestimative (BUFFINGTON; MONTGOMERY, 2013), once there \nis a lack of  direct observations in field with appropriate quality \nand quantity that could allow the development of  physically-based \nsediment models (BRARDINONI et al., 2015)\n\nMontgomery et al. (1996) followed the hypothesis of  Gilbert \n(1917) in which gravel bedload rivers occur where the transport \ncapacity exceeds the sediment supply, meanwhile alluvial rivers \noccur where the sediment supply corresponds to or exceeds the \ntransport capacity. Schumm (1977) commented that the channel \npatterns and their stability are influenced by sediment size and \ntransport mode (of  suspension, mixed with bedload, or bedload). \nIn  case of  the suspended sediment load, there are several attempts \nto estimate their quantity by using turbidity sensors (SARI; \nCASTRO; KOBIYAMA, 2015; SARI et al., 2016).\n\nIn mountain rivers which used to present low suspension \nsediment load, bedload discharge is the main way of  sediment \ntransport (MONTGOMERY et al., 1996). According to Merten \nand Minella (2015), in case without a measurement of  bedload \nsediment discharge, it is recommended to use Einsten or Colby \nequations or also a supposition that a certain percentage of  the \nsuspension represents the bedload discharge. In Brazil, it is very \ncommon to consider 10% of  the total sediment transport as \nbedload (CARVALHO et al., 2000). By monitoring a river in \nsemi-arid region in Brazil, Cantalice et al. (2013) showed that the \npercentage of  bedload to suspended sediment load varied from \n4 to 12.72%. Although Macedo et al. (2017) investigated the \nbedload transport, their study area was a floodplain area without \nmountain environments.\n\nTo understand the sediment dynamics and sediment \nload transport is a fundamental task for classifying rivers as \nmountain rivers or not. However, it is quite difficult to observe the \ntransformation from mountain to alluvial river, which needs the \nimprovement of  field surveys in mountain environments. Even it \ncould be hard and time-consuming, it is necessary to estimate the \namount of  sediment load. Thus, further the need for the field \nhydrometry just increases.\n\nSediment size\n\nThe spatial and temporal distribution of  the sediments \ncan strongly affect the water discharges conditions, the turbulence \nstructures and the sediment transport rates (BATHURST, 1987; \nRICKENMANN, 2001; DEY et al., 2011; TSAKIRIS et al., \n2014). Large sediments strongly increases the spatial variability of  \ndischarge and turbulence intensities in a reach scale (DEY et al., \n2011; OZGOREN et al., 2013).\n\nDue to its great importance in the water flow dynamics \nin rivers, the sediments size distribution should be described in \norder to demonstrate its characteristics as accurately as possible. \nThe  sediment size is used, for example, to estimate hydraulic \ncharacteristics for incipient sediment movement (MAO; LENZI, \n2007). There are some parameters of  interest, as D\n\n16\n, D\n\n50\n, D\n\n84\n and D\n\n90\n.\n\nAlthough exists a diversity in sediment measurement methods \nin rivers (CHURCH; MCLEAN; WOLCOTT, 1987; ISO, 1992; \nRAMOS, 1996), a few papers provide information on bedload \nmaterial sampling in small mountain catchments (BUNTE; ABT, \n2001). In order to describe such size distribution in mountain \nrivers, Bevenger and King (1995) proposed a counting sediment \nprocedure, in which the grains are sampled since a cross section \nfrom bank to bank.\n\nFang, Liu and Stoesser (2017) commented that large \nsediments are capable to promote changes in the field of  discharges \nand that they may cause flow deacceleration, corridor and vortex \nformation, internal and external turbulence and redistribution of  \nshear stress. When large sediments are neglected, these alterations \nas well as sediment transport ratio may be subestimated. In this \nway, the importance of  spatial distribution of  large sediments, \ni.e., the maximum sediment sizes, or D\n\n100\n must be emphasized.\n\nHence, it is very clear to say the need to perform field \nsurvey to describe appropriately the sediment size in rivers. Mao, \nComiti and Lenzi (2010) verified sediment size distribution through \nfield survey and evaluated the river competence in an Italian Alps \ncatchment. They utilized markers in a widely range of  sediment size \nthat allowed them to infer possible discharges capable to transport \nthese sediments. Buckrell (2015) evaluated differences in sediment \nsize distribution for pools and riffles sequences, and reported that \nthey are considerable distinct in sediment size, which requires further \ninvestigation in situ. In addition, distinct technologies could be \nused for estimating the sediment size, such as the drone images \nprocessing (MU et al., 2018) or satellite images (CASADO et al., \n2015). Mu et al. (2018) performed machine learning to identify \nmorphological characteristics of  the sediments. Although this \ntechnology has been advancing very rapidly, field survey, i.e., field \nhydrometry, is still necessary for obtaining basic data.\n\nBRAZILIAN SCENARIO\n\nThe development and occupation have been increasing \nsignificantly in Brazilian mountain regions (KOBIYAMA et al., \n2018). According to Hewitt (2004), the growing use of  mountain \nareas has been rising the hazard for hydrologically-extreme events \ndue to pressure for development and environmental changes.\n\nMountain environments have been served as alternative for \nwater supply from large rivers that water quality are now deteriorated \n\n\n\nRBRH, Porto Alegre, v. 24, e10, 2019\n\nRelevant parameters for characterizing mountain rivers: a review\n\n8/13\n\non its quality (PAIX\u00c3O; KOBIYAMA; CAMPAGNOLO, 2017). \nSuch situation stimulates public agencies to build up capitation, \ntreatment and feed water infrastructure in these regions.\n\nIn addition, mountain regions have been increasingly sought \nafter and exploited for recreation and ecotourism activities. Data \nfrom National Parks and Conservation Units Visitors showed \nthat, in Federal areas, the total number of  visitors grew from \n3 million in 2007 to more than 8 million in 2016 (IBAMA, 2016). \nAn expressive number of  federal conservation areas are located in \nmountain regions, for examples, Aparados da Serra, Serra Geral, \nChapada dos Guimar\u00e3es and Itatiaia National Parks.\n\nAs exploitation and occupation of  mountain environments \nhave been rising in Brazil and the studies referred to these areas \nstill are scarce, it is important to incentivize basic studies about \nmountain rivers characterization. Such studies will subsidize the \ncomprehension of  the water and sediment dynamics in these \nenvironments.\n\nFaria (2000) evaluated the influence of  vegetation on \nfluvial processes in first order catchments, highlighted that woody \ndebris (tree trunks, branches and leaves) interfere in water flow by \ndiverse ways, and commented that the sediment delivery in these \ncatchments occurs in pulses when such structures are destroyed. \nAssessing geomorphic responses in fluvial first order channels, \nFaria (2014) reported that sediment transport presents a very \ndifferentiated dynamics when compared with larger rivers and, \ntherefore, the first order channels demand more studies.\n\nBy using principal component analysis and cluster analysis, \nSodr\u00e9 et al. (2007) performed a multivariate analysis for describing \nand classifying morphometric parameters in catchments in Alto \nJequita\u00ed-MG. The analyzed parameters were altimetry, terrain slope, \nhillslope curvature, contribution area and catchment perimeter. \nThe authors segmented catchments according to their similarity \npatterns, evidencing that spatial patterns reflect the similar \ndynamics among them.\n\nSilveira and Ramos (2007) carried out a spatial analysis \nof  environmental parameters and hydrological behavior of  a \nmountain catchment at Serra dos \u00d3rg\u00e3os-RJ. For this analysis, \nthe authors used the Ground Penetration Radar (GPR) to \nevaluate the distribution and transition of  soil horizons in field, \ninvestigated the sediment size distribution at distinct locations \nin the catchment and used fluviometric data with 30 minutes of  \ntemporal resolution. The  field survey allowed the determination \nof  landscape development patterns for different lithological units \nin the catchment, indicating factors that act as controllers in the \nrelation between rainfall and discharge in this mountain region.\n\nOlszevski et al. (2011) evaluated the morphology and \nthe hydrological aspects by using morphometric characteristics \nof  the terrain and the drainage network in order to predict the \nhydrological behavior. Lopes (2012) used topographic attributes \nfor trying to establish the relation between topography and \ndischarge in the Alt\u00edssimo Rio Negro catchment (PR/SC). Such \nattributes were obtained from GIS processing and field survey \nfor discharge measurements.\n\nTelles, Rodrigues and Silva Neto (2016) carried out \nautomatic calibration of  hydrodynamic simulator by using direct \nand reverse problems, whose objective was to minimize the \ndifference between experimental data referred to river level and \n\nsimulated values obtained in the direct problem. The authors utilized \ndata with 15 minutes of  temporal resolution, and obtained the \nsatisfactory results. However, the authors stated that the results \ncould be better in case they had more parameters in the analysis, \ni.e., if  they had more detailed description of  hydrogeomorphic \nprocesses that occur in mountain environments. One of  the main \npropositions of  Telles, Rodrigues and Silva Neto (2016) was to \nconsider the roughness variability along the channel so as to make \nthe prediction more realistic to physical characteristics observed \nin terrain. It  indirectly means that reach scale needs to be better \ndescribed for a good representation of  its processes.\n\nStudies related to modeling and water quality have been \nincreasing in Brazil. For exemple, Von Sperling (2007) recommended \nthe use of  nine parameters (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, \nBOD, thermotolerant coliforms, total nitrogen, total phosphor, \ntotal solids and turbidity) for evaluating the water quality index.\n\nGirardi et al. (2016) evaluated the changes in water quality \nduring rainfall events in the Cubat\u00e3o do Sul river catchment, in Santa \nCatarina state. In the study were evaluated two sub-catchments, \nbeing one of  them predominantly mountain environment. \nThe temperature, electrical conductivity, turbidity, pH, ammonium \nion and dissolved oxygen were treated. The authors observed \nthat the catchment is influenced by discharges with short return \nperiods and the water quality keeps a uniform behavior during \ndry and rainy periods in the mountain sub-catchment which is \nmostly preserved.\n\nRodrigues et al. (2012) tried to estimate dispersion pollutant \nparameters in mountain rivers by using the Luus-Jaakola algorithm. \nThey commented that the dispersion of  pollutants in natural \nstreams have been based on classical experiments that consider a \nGaussian distribution of  one substance concentration, however, \nit is not verified in mountain environments. Thus, when using \nadvection-dispersion model, they had good estimative to calculate \ntransport of  a conservative substance.\n\nHence, it is observed that studies on mountain rivers are \nstill a few when compared with alluvial rivers and floodplains in \nBrazil. Such situation probably implies that researchers are more \ninterested in larger catchments and large rivers because of  the \nhydroelectric energy generation and also because of  the fact that the \nlarge portions facilitate studies using remote sensing. That is why, \nin order to better understand mountain rivers, Brazilian researches \nshould add efforts on field surveys activities, carrying out in situ \nmeasurements, since mountain rivers have been increasingly used \nby the Brazilian society.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nDue to increasing use of  mountain environments in Brazil, \nit is suggested that river classifications must be performed by \nconsidering their uses for different purposes.\n\nFor characterizing mountain rivers, it is proposed to use \nhierarchical classifications where rivers are evaluated on different \nscales of  analysis (river, segment, reach, channel units, etc.) in order \nto analyze the relevant parameters for its characterization. According \nto Wohl (2010), the most permanent parameter in the analysis of  \nmountain rivers is the channel gradient. Thus, in the impossibility \nof  a complete characterization of  a river, channel gradient may \n\n\n\nRBRH, Porto Alegre, v. 24, e10, 2019\n\nPaix\u00e3o and Kobiyama\n\n9/13\n\noffer subside for preliminary characterization of  mountain rivers. \nIt is emphasized that for a complete estimative field observations \nare necessary, which requires financial expenditure and time.\n\nThe identification of  the minimum relevant parameters \nneeded for characterizing mountain rivers is a demand both for \nscientific community and for Brazil, once this country has been \nintensifying the use and occupation of  mountain environments \nand there is a lack of  studies in such environments. Thus, based \non the literature review, it was observed that the most utilized \nparameters for characterizing mountain rivers are: channel gradient, \ndischarge, relation between river width and depth, entrenchment \nratio, sediment load, and sediment size.\n\nAlthough some parameters can be measured with geoprocessing \ntechniques, most of  them should be measured in situ. It strongly \nindicates the importance of  performing hydrometry, topography \nand topobathymetry in field survey.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nANA \u2013 AG\u00caNCIA NACIONAL DE \u00c1GUAS.
