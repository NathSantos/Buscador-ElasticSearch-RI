Objective: To evaluate filling ability and \nporosity of root-end filling materials using microcomputed tomography (micro-CT).  Material and method: Cavities \nwith 1 mm internal diameter and 3 mm depth were prepared in bovine dentin sections by using ultrasonic tips \n(CVD No. 6.1107-6), and filled by Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA); Sealer 26 (S26) and zinc oxide and eugenol \ncement (ZOE). Before and after filling, cavities were scanned by using micro-CT (SkyScan 1176). Filling and porosity \nwere analyzed by using CTAn software. Filling ability was calculated based on volumetric percentage of the filled cavity. \nThe number and percentage of closed pores were measured throughout entire extension of the filled cavity (total) and \nin each third (cervical, middle and apical), by using bi and tridimensional analyses. The filling data were submitted \nto ANOVA and Tukey statistical tests, and porosity data to Kruskall-Wallis and Dunn tests, at a 5% significance level.  \nResult: S26 and ZOE presented higher filling ability than MTA (p<0.05). S26 showed the highest total porosity (number \nand percentage) (p<0.05). In all thirds after 2D and 3D analyses, porosity was higher for S26 in comparison to MTA \nand ZOE (p<0.05). Conclusion: Although Sealer 26 presented more porosity, the material was associated with a great \nfilling ability. Micro-CT analysis showed no correlation between filling ability and porosity. \n\nDescriptors: X-Ray Microtomography; porosity; dental materials; endodontics.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMicrocomputed tomography (micro-CT) is a non-destructive \ntool used for different studies in Endodontics as analysis of root \ncanal filling1, filling ability of the reparative materials2 and the \nevaluation of interface material/dentin associated with different \n\nroot canal filling techniques and materials3. Micro-CT is also used \nfor evaluating the volumetric change in endodontic materials, with \npossible correlation with solubility4 and dimensional change after \nimmersion in distilled water2.\n\n\n\nRev Odontol UNESP. 2017 Nov-Dec; 46(6): 362-367 Micro-CT analysis of filling... 363\n\nThe porosity of a material may be affected by physicochemical \nproperties. Cements with absence of macropores and lower porosity \nmay present less penetration of oral fluids, bacteria and bacterial \ntoxins into root canal5. Pores in sealers appear to be originated from \nthe air trapped in the mass of cement during handling manipulation6. \nPorosity may be analyzed by means of microscopy, using porosimetry \nby mercury intrusion7, or by using microcomputed tomography8,9. \nDe Souza\u00a0et\u00a0al.10, using a 3D model, quantitatively evaluated the \ndegree of porosity of calcium-silicate based materials analyzing \nthe images obtained by microcomputed tomography. 3D models \nwere evaluated and the porosity parameters of each material \nwere obtained by comparison with standard porosity values of \nBiodentine\u00ae. This tool allows a tridimensional mensuration (with \nvolumetric results \u2013 mm3) of failures. Surface area, volumetric \nanalysis, the amount of pores and specific characteristics of these \nstructures can be assessed.\n\nClinically, these physical properties of root-end filling materials \nare relevant. High porosity values for endodontic materials may \naffects its physical properties7, besides increasing the leakage5. \nA better sealing can be obtained using a material presenting low \ndisintegration and solubility11 and it may be directly related to \nleakage12. Also, proper sealing may be related to complete filling \nof the cavity. Analyzing physicochemical (i.e solubility, pH, filling \nability) and biological (i.e biocompatibility, bioactivity) characteristics \nto the root-end filling material may improve the success of the \ntreatment2,4,7,12.\n\nMineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) is a biocompatible calcium \nsilicate-based material with capacity to induce repair by mineralized \ntissue13. However, the fluid consistency makes it difficult to insert \nMTA into the root-end cavity, and can harm filling and sealing14. \nSealer 26 (S26) is a resin-based endodontic sealer, composed of \nbismuth oxide, calcium hydroxide and epoxy resin, and requires \nhigher powder/resin proportion to favor insertion into root-end \ncavities13. It has excellent sealing properties when used as root-\nend filling material15, and presents interface adaptation similar to \ncalcium silicate-based cements16. Zinc oxide and Eugenol cement \n(ZOE) may also be used with higher powder/liquid proportion17, \nfavoring its insertion into root-end cavities.\n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the filling ability and \nporosity of root-end filling materials by using microcomputed \ntomography. The null hypothesis was that there is no difference \nbetween the materials, and the properties of porosity and filling \nability are associated.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHOD\n\nSample Preparation\n\nBovine teeth were used in this study. The coronal portion was \nremoved. The root portion was sectioned into 5mm slices, using \nan Isomet 1000 (Buehler Ltd., Lake Bluff, IL, USA) machine. \nOn dentine surface of each slice, root-end cavities with standardized \ndimensions (1.5 mm diameter and 3 mm deep) were prepared \nby making intermittent forward-backward movements18 using a \nhigh-speed 2137 bur (KG SORENSEN, Cotia, SP, Brazil). Ultrasonic \ntip CVD No 6.1107-6 (CVD-Vale, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos/SP, Brazil) \ncoupled to an ultrasonic device CVDentus (CVD-Vale, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 \n\ndos Campos/SP, Brazil) was used on the dentinal walls. In order \nto maintain the same position during the scans, the samples were \nfixed in culture plates with silicone. Each well of the culture plate \nwas filled with a standard amount of silicone and the samples were \nplaced into this material, at all stages.\n\nSample Scanning\n\nAfter cavity preparation, samples with empty cavities were \nsubjected to microtomographic scannings (Micro-CT SkyScan 1176, \nBruker micro-CT Kontich, Belgium). The scanning procedure was \nperformed with 50 kV X-ray tube voltages and 800 \u00b5A anode current; \naluminum filter of 0.5; isotropic voxel of 9 \u00b5m; and an evolution \ncycle of 360\u00b0. To standardize the position of samples, specimens \nwere fixed in culture plates with silicone, as already described.\n\nFilling Ability\n\nThe prepared cavities were then randomly divided into three \ngroups, according to the material. MTA Angelus (Angelus, Londrina, \nPR, Brazil) was manipulated by a same operator previously calibrated \nusing powder/liquid proportion of 1g/330\u00b5L. S26 (Dentsply, \nPetropolis, RJ, Brazil) was prepared in a thicker consistency than \nused as endodontic sealer, in a 4:1 powder/resin proportion (14). \nZOE cement (S.S.White Art. Dent. Ltda., Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil) \nwas used in the proportion of 1 g zinc oxide to 0.2 mL eugenol. \nThe cavities were filled with the materials by using a condenser \n(Trinity, S\u00e3o Paulo, SP, Brazil). Samples were maintained at 37\u00baC \nand 100% humidity for three times the material setting time. \nAfter this period, each filled sample was subjected to another \nmicrotomographic scanning, as previously described.\n\nFilling Ability Analysis\n\nThe scanned images were reconstructed by using NRecon \nsoftware (V1.6.4,7; SkyScan, Belgium). The correction parameters \nsmoothing, beam hardening and ring artefacts were carefully adjusted \nand maintained for all the periods, using values of 7, 20% and 10, \nrespectively. These image parameters were used for all materials, \nto standardize the analysis process (scanning, reconstruction and \nanalyzing criteria). After reconstruction, images were analyzed by \nusing CTAn software (V1.11.8; SkyScan, Belgium). To obtain the total \nvolume of material in mm3, the area of interest the region of interest \n(ROI) was defined by previous tests and a calibrated operator made \nall the analyzes of each sample, excluding the dentin. The binary \nvalue (threshold) was adjusted to assure the analysis of the material \nand the total volume of the material in mm3 from quantitative \nanalysis was obtained. Filling was determined by calculating the \nsubtracting the initial (empty cavities) from the final (filled cavities) \nassessed volume of each sample. The results were then converted \ninto percentages based on the initial volume. 3D models from \neach specimen were carefully obtained by using CTVol software \n(V2.0, SkyScan, Belgium) to analyze qualitatively the data.\n\nPorosity Analysis\n\nMicro-CT proved to be a powerful nondestructive 3D analysis \ntool for visualizing the porous internal microstructure3. So, at this \nstage, the filled cavities were analyzed by means of CTAn software \n\n\n\n Tanomaru-Filho, Espir, Nogueira\u00a0et\u00a0al. Rev Odontol UNESP. 2017 Nov-Dec; 46(6): 362-367364\n\n(V1.11.8; SkyScan, Belgium). The porosity parameters for each \nsample were measured and number and percentage of closed \npores were obtained. Total porosity throughout the entire material \nextent was determined. The limits of each sample were defined by \nusing the \u201ctop\u201d and \u201cbottom\u201d tool (Figure\u00a01A). A circular VOI, \nmeasuring average 0.75 x 0.75, was determined to each analyzes \nto exclude any possible artefact related to the sample border. \nThus, approximately 1 mm2 of margin was excluded. The internal \nportion of the materials was analyzed by the difference in radiopacity. \nAfter this, using the software\u2019s porosity tool, the bidimensional \ntotal porosity values were obtained, according to number and \npercentage of closed pores. This feature allows porosity analysis \nfor individual objects in 2D (bidimensional). It has been defined \nas the area of any spaces fully surrounded by solid, as a percent \nof the area of solid plus closed pores. Subsequently, by using the \n3D (tridimensional) analysis tool, the number and percentage \nof closed pores were obtained by means of tridimensional data, \nproviding volumetric data. In this case, a closed pore in 3D is a \nconnected assemblage of space voxels that is fully surrounded \non all sides in 3D by solid voxels. In addition a tridimensional \nmodel of the samples was obtained by using the CTVol software \n(V2.0, SkyScan, Belgium).\n\nTo obtain more precise and specific analysis, sections with \nsmaller thickness were also analyzed. The \u201ctop\u201d and \u201cbottom\u201d tool \n\nwas used to define 0.5mm sections to evaluate the porosity in the \ndifferent cavity thirds: coronal, middle and apical (Figure\u00a0 1B). \nThe analysis was performed as previously described. For each third, \nthe number and percentage of closed pores were calculated, and \n3D models were obtained.\n\nData from filling analysis were submitted to ANOVA and the \nTukey tests, with 5% significance. Porosity data were submitted to \nthe Kruskall-Wallis test, complemented by the Dunn test, with a \nlevel of significance of 5%.\n\nRESULT\n\nFilling Ability\n\nData obtained for filling volumetric analysis are represented \nin Table\u00a0 1. Similar filling ability was observed for S26 and ZOE \n(p>0.05), and both presented higher values than MTA (p<0.05). \n3D model analyses (Figure\u00a02) show similar characteristics for S26 \nand ZOE, in comparison with MTA.\n\nPorosity\n\nThe data obtained for porosity are described in Table\u00a0 2. \n2D and 3D analyses presented similar patterns of comparison \namong the materials. S26 showed higher values for number and \npercentage of closed pores considering the total extent or each \nthird analysis (p<0.05). MTA and ZOE cement were similar for all \nthe analyses (p>0.05). Considering absolute values for both tests, \nthe bidimensional analysis showed higher values in percentage \nand lower values for number of pores, while the tridimensional \nanalysis revealed higher number of pores and a lower percentage. \n3D models porosity models for each third were obtained (Figure\u00a03). \nThe higher porosity observed to S26 was clearly observed in the \nqualitative analysis in comparison with MTA and ZOE, in all \nthirds evaluated.\n\nFigure 1.

The larger powder to \nresin/liquid used to manipulate S26 and ZOE cement made it \npossible to increase their consistency, favoring their insertion \ninto the root-end cavity. By using microcomputed tomography, \nCavenago\u00a0 et\u00a0 al.4 evaluated the solubility of MTA with different \npowder-liquid ratio (4:1, 3:1 and 2:1) before and after immersion \nin water for 7 days. They observed that the material manipulated \nwith larger quantity of water promoted greater change in volume. \nTherefore, the difficulty with inserting MTA into the cavity13 \ncannot be improved by changing the powder/liquid proportion. \n\nFor this reason, a better fill can be achieved using materials which \nallow changes in handling, facilitating insertion into the cavity \n(i.e. S26 and ZOE cement).\n\nProper cavity filling with a material presenting low disintegration \nand solubility may allow a better sealing. Favorable sealing ability \nfor some materials may be related to its dimensional stability and \nfilling, which led to less leakage11. Chittoni\u00a0et\u00a0al.12 observed lower \nbacterial leakage for Sealer 26 in comparison with MTA. Sealer 26 has \nalso demonstrated to prevent bacterial leakage when compared \nwith IRM15. Amoroso-Silva\u00a0 et\u00a0 al.16 demonstrated that Sealer 26, \nMTA and calcium silicate cements were similar after analyzing \nsealing by fluid leakage and dentinal adaptation. In the present \nstudy, similar filling ability was observed for S26 and ZOE, and \nboth presented higher values than MTA. Torres\u00a0 et\u00a0 al.2 observed \nthat ZOE presented better filling ability than MTA. Dias\u00a0 et\u00a0 al.19 \nobserved that the modification of a composite resin with small \namounts of zinc oxide (ZnO) microparticles significantly inhibited \nthe S. mutans growth on resin surface without significant alterations \nof its mechanical strength. This filling capacity may be related to the \nbetter consistency. The results obtained may suggest this relationship. \nS26 and ZOE cement presented similar characteristics of filling \ncompared to MTA. The presence of space at the interface of the \nfilling material and the root canal wall can result from deficient \nadaptation of the filling material to the root dentin20. Despite the \nexcellent properties of MTA, the condensation technique may have \nsome influence in its sealing ability.\n\nPorosity analysis aims to measure the \u201cfailure fraction\u201d and empty \nspaces, counting the spaces and characterizing their connections. \nThe closed pores represent empty spaces completely surrounded \nby material, which is difficult to be analyzed by conventional \nmethodologies. The use of microcomputed tomography allows \n\nFigure 3. Representative aspect of material porosities observed in the \ndifferent evaluated thirds for each evaluated material.\n\nTable 2.

Rev Odontol UNESP. 2017 Nov-Dec; 46(6): 362-367366\n\nevaluation of these faults10. Microtomography has been used to \nevaluate the porosity of different materials8,9. Kerckhofs\u00a0 et\u00a0 al.8 \naiming to validate micro-CT as an imaging tool for analysis of \npores, pointed out errors inherent to the analyses that may result \nin an incorrect interpretation. Artifacts might influence the quality \nof the images, challenging image analyses, once the images are \nreconstructed with several independent detector measurements21. \nAs an example, streaking artefacts, which happen generally due to \nan inconsistency in a single measurement; ring artefacts, which \nappear due to errors in an individual detector calibration, distortion \nartefacts, due to the geometry of image reconstruction. In order to \nminimize these errors, all reconstructions were performed using \nthe artifact reduction tools. De Souza\u00a0et\u00a0al.10 proposed a standard \nto obtain the threshold, using known values for the porosity of \neach material. Therefore, the use of microcomputed tomography \nfor porosity analysis also presents variations that must suggest \npatterns based on the experiment performed and type of sample.\n\nAccording to the manufacturer (Bruker-microCT, Kontich, \nBelgium), the CTAn software allows the analysis of porosity of \nany type of material. In this study, samples were scanned at a \nhigh resolution (9um), considered proper for quantifying pores22. \nDuring the reconstruction of images, standardized parameters were \nused in order to decrease artefacts. Analysis of the total sample \nextent presented more difficulty with defining the parameters, \nespecially the histogram. Therefore, analysis of smaller sections \n(or thirds) is considered important for correct analysis.\n\nAs regards the results of this study, the two measurement analyses \nshowed greater porosity for S26 in comparison with MTA and \nZOE cement, for both number and percentage of pores. However, \nthe 2D analyses showed higher percentage values, while the 3D \npresented a higher number of pores. In microscopic 2D images, a \n\nfailure may appear as a closed pore, while in the 3D evaluation this \npore is considered connected to the external space, which is one \nadvantage of 3D analysis in comparison with conventional methods. \nTherefore, 3D analysis is indicated for this type of porosity analysis. \nBidimensional analysis was evaluated to obtain complementary data. \nIn the present study, bidimensional and tridimensional analysis \npresented correlated results for material porosities.\n\nThe analysis of porosity did not show correlation with filling \ndata, since S26 and ZOE cement promoted greater filling. Otherwise, \nmore porosity was observed for S26 when compared with MTA and \nZOE cement, rejecting the null hypothesis. The immediate porosity \n(after the material set) is related to the material composition and \nhydration mechanism, especially to water/powder proportion for \nMTA23. MTA has demonstrated porosity in different formulations, \nespecially after long evaluation periods3. The low porosity observed \nfor MTA in the present study may be related to the different \nmethodologies and analysis performed immediately after cavity \nfilling. Mutal, Gani6, after a qualitative analysis of pores in endodontic \nsealers, including zinc oxide and eugenol cements and Sealer 26, \nobserved that the frequency and size of pores were related to the \nconsistency of the material, and was increased for sealers with \ncalcium hydroxide, such as Sealer 26.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nBased on the methodology used and the results obtained, we \ncould conclude that Sealer 26 and ZOE cement showed better filling \nability in comparison to MTA. On the other hand, Sealer 26 presented \nporosity higher in number and percentage than MTA and zinc \noxide and eugenol.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1. Jung M, Lommel D, Klimek J.
