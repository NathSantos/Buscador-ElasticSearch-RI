A mineralogia, textura e valores de ?13Ccarbonatos indica que as \ndiferentes litologias s\u00e3o formadas a partir de oxida\u00e7\u00e3o de metano que induz a \ncimenta\u00e7\u00e3o dos sedimentos por precipita\u00e7\u00e3o de dolomite, calcite magnesiana, \ncalcite e aragonite autig\u00e9nicas. \nOs diferentes carbonatos autig\u00e9nicos derivados de metano (CADM) ocorrem \nassociados a vulc\u00f5es e cones de lama, cristas diapiricas ou ao longo de falhas.\nDois grupos distintos de CADM foram descritos. Um grupo cuja mineralogia \u00e9 \ndominada por dolomite e que ocorrem como crostas, chamin\u00e9s ou n\u00f3dulos, e \num outro grupo com a mineralogia dominada por aragonite e que ocorrem sub \na forma de crostas, pavimentos ou mont\u00edculos, no fundo do mar. \nOs diferentes grupos de CADM reflectem diferentes ambientes geoqu\u00edmicos de \nforma\u00e7\u00e3o. Os CADM aragoniticos formam-se pr\u00f3ximo da interface \nsedimento/\u00e1gua, enquanto que os CADM dolom\u00edticos formam-se por \ncimenta\u00e7\u00e3o ao longo de condutas por onde o fluido circulou dentro da coluna \nsedimentar em ambientes confinados relativamente \u00e0 \u00e1gua do mar. \nA ocorr\u00eancia destes CADM \u00e9 interpretada como indicadora de extenso escape \nde metano na \u00e1rea do Golfo de C\u00e1dis. \nBiomarcadores indicadores de Archaea capaz de realizar oxida\u00e7\u00e3o anaer\u00f3bica \nde metano (OAM) e biomarcadores indicadores de bact\u00e9rias sulfato-redutoras \nforam identificados nas amostras de CADM.

Mineralogy, texture and ?13Ccarbonate values clearly indicate that the \ndifferent carbonate lithologies are methane-derived (MDAC), formed by the \nlithification of sediments as result of the precipitation of authigenic dolomite, \ncalcite, Mg-calcite and aragonite. \nThe MDAC are found associated with mud volcanoes and mud cones, diapiric \nridges or along faults. \nTwo distinct groups of MDAC were described in the Gulf of Cadiz. A group \ndominated by dolomite mineralogy (dolomite crusts, nodules and chimneys) \nand a group of aragonite dominated carbonates (aragonite pavements, slabs, \ncrusts and buildups). \nThe different MDAC morphologic types reflect different geochemical formation \nenvironments. The aragonite pavements represent precipitation of authigenic \ncarbonates at the sediment-seawater interface or close to it. The dolomite \nnodules, crusts and chimneys result from the cementation along fluid conduits \ninside the sediment column, in more confined geochemical environments. \nThe widespread abundance of MDAC is interpreted as an evidence of several \nepisodes of extensive methane seepage in the Gulf of Cadiz. \nSpecific 13C-depleted lipid biomarkers indicating archaea involvement in the \nanaerobic oxidation of methane and bacterial lipid biomarkers also 13C-\ndepleted and related to sulphate reducing bacteria were both identified on the \nMDAC. These results, substantiated by SEM observations and by microbial \nrelated microfabrics, confirm that microbial activity has played an important role \nin carbonate authigenesis. \nConsidering the minimum and maximum temperature limits admitted to be \npossible to occur in the Gulf of Cadiz, some of the MDAC samples indicate a \nformation from 18O-enriched pore fluids, interpreted as resulting from a \ncontribution of dissociated gas hydrates to the pore waters from which the \nauthigenic carbonates were formed. \nThe estimated U/Th ages of selected dolomite chimneys indicate episodes of \nintense precipitation of the authigenic carbonates, at least during the last 250 \nka, that correlate with periods of rapid paleoceanographic changes as the \nonsets of glacial/interglacial terminations. \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz  \n\n i\n\n \n\nTable of contents \n\n \nAgradecimentos \nPalavras-chave \nResumo \nAcknowledgements \nKeywords \nAbstract \nTable of contents i \nList of tables ix \nList of figures xi \n \n \nChapter 1.

Introduction \n \n\n \n\n1.1 Nature and scope of this research \n\n \n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz is located south of Iberia, in an area where a broad spectrum of \n\ngeological processes of global importance are active. These include: (1) the tectonic \n\nevolution of the Africa-Iberia plate boundary; (2) the formation of the Gibraltar orogenic \n\narc; (3) various sedimentological and oceanographic processes related to the Mediterranean \n\nOutflow; (4) the formation and dissociation of methane hydrates and associated deep water \n\necosystems; (5) the widespread occurrence of mud volcanism and methane-derived \n\nauthigenic carbonates. \n\nThe return flow and the impact of volatiles (especially methane) and other fluids at \n\ncontinental margins such as the Gulf of Cadiz, where sediment and sedimentary rock \n\nsequences of a continental crust with a thicknesses of 11 to 30 km are observed (Medialdea \n\net al., 2004) have complex effects on the geosphere, biosphere, ocean and atmosphere, and \n\nare high priority objectives in present day geosciences. Sediment compaction and \n\ngeochemical processes during diagenesis are responsible for the major fluid input into the \n\nsedimentary basins and subduction zones, together with the alteration products of the \n\noceanic crust and the trench-fill from down-slope mass wasting. The output of the volatile \n\nphases from the sedimentary pile is done via fluid venting at the deformation front of \n\naccretionary complexes, together with widespread mud diapirism, mud volcanism, cold \n\nseepage and gas hydrate dynamics. These volatile phases are either ejected into the \n\nbiosphere, ocean and atmosphere, accreted to the edges of continental plates or transported \n\ninto the lower mantle. \n\nThis work focuses on the study of fluid escape structures and processes in the South \n\nPortuguese margin and the Gulf of Cadiz. It aims to contribute to a better understanding of \n\nthe nature, structural control and the characteristics of the fluid escape structures in the \n\nGulf of Cadiz. It is especially focused on the study of the methane-derived authigenic \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 1. Introduction \n\n \n\n 2 \n\ncarbonates associated with modern and fossil methane seepage in an area of extensive mud \n\nvolcanism. The gas hydrates occurrence, formation and dissociation, the tectonic \n\nimplications and significance of the fluid escape structures are also investigated. \n\nGas charged sediments, revealed by acoustic blanking zones and acoustic turbidity, \n\nsurface and buried pockmarks and acoustic anomalies in the water column have been also \n\nidentified and described in the central eastern continental shelf and upper slope areas of the \n\nGulf of Cadiz (Baraza and Ercilla, 1996; Baraza et al., 1999). Both were interpreted as \n\nindicating active fluid escape in this region. \n\nIn 1992, during the Kane cruise, organized by the Marine Physics Branch of the \n\nNaval Research Laboratory, USA (NRL) in cooperation with the Hawaii Mapping \n\nResearch Group and the Naval Oceanographic Office, a high quality side-scan sonar \n\nmosaic was acquired for a large part of the slope, upper and lower continental rise of the \n\ncentral part of the Gulf of Cadiz. This coverage revealed a large number of structures that \n\nwere inferred to be mud volcanoes (Gardner, 2001; Gardner, 2002). In 1999, during the \n\nTraining Through Research Cruise (TTR09), ground-truthing in some of these structures \n\nretrieved gas charged mud breccia and confirmed their mud volcanic nature (Gardner, \n\n2001). \n\nSince 1999, a strong effort has been made by several scientific research teams to \n\ninvestigate the fluid escape processes in the Gulf of Cadiz, and several Portuguese and \n\ninternational projects have focused this topic in this area. The research presented in this \n\nthesis was developed in the framework of the INGMAR (PLE/4/98), the Training Through \n\nResearch program (IOC/UNESCO \u2013 Moscow State University), and the MVSEIS -\n\nEuromargins (01-LEC-EMA24F) projects. The INGMAR project (\u201cRefor\u00e7o da \n\nCapacidade de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o no Dom\u00ednio da Geologia Marinha\u201d, Sub-project: Geology \n\nand resources of the Portuguese Margin) was developed at the Marine Geology \n\nDepartment of the Geological and Mining Institute, now National Institute of Engineering, \n\nTechnology and Innovation, I.P. (INETI) with financial support from the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a \n\nCi\u00eancia e a Tecnologia (FCT) and was coordinated by one of the supervisers of this thesis \n\n(L. M. Pinheiro). The INGMAR project started in 1998 with the objective of investigate \n\nthe geology and the resources of the Portuguese margin and finished in 2003. The \n\nUNESCO-IOC Training Through Research (TTR) program employs an innovative concept \n\nthat directly interlinks two major components: scientific research and education. This \n\n\n\n \n\nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 3\n\nprogram provides to students advanced training in marine science, from the phases of data \n\ncollection, processing, laboratory analyses and, ultimately, the presentation and publication \n\nof the research results, under supervision of senior top researchers from several European \n\ntop research institutions. The Euromargins/Eurocores programme project MVSEIS \n\n\u201cTectonic control, deep crustal structure and fluid escape pathways in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\nmud volcano field\u201d started on June 2003 and integrates Portuguese, Spanish, Belgium and \n\nFrench teams under the coordination of the Portuguese team (L. M. Pinheiro). The \n\nPortuguese work package has been founded by the Portuguese Science Foundation - FCT. \n\nThe objective of the MVSEIS project is to investigate the deep crustal structure, the \n\nsedimentary section and sediment dynamics, the tectonic control and the detailed geometry \n\nof the fluid escape pathways in this area with active mud volcanism and cold seeps, using a \n\nmultidisciplinary approach. The multidisciplinary approach gives the opportunity to link \n\nthe tectonic, sedimentological, geochemical and biological processes associated with the \n\nmud volcanism and gas seepage. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.2 Geographical location and physiography of the study area  \n\n \n\nThe study area of this work corresponds to the South Portuguese Margin and the \n\nGulf of Cadiz (Figure 1.1 and Figure 1.2). It is delimited by the parallels 34\u00ba45\u2019N and \n\n36\u00ba45\u2019N and by the meridians 6\u00ba25\u2019W and 10\u00baW. The water depth in the study area ranges \n\nfrom 200 m to 4000 m. It corresponds mainly to the upper and lower continental slopes \n\nand the uppermost part of the Horseshoe and Seine abyssal plains in the South Iberian \n\nAtlantic margin and the North African Atlantic margin of Morocco. \n\nThe morphology of the Gulf of Cadiz is characterized by a complex tectonic \n\nstructure with an accretionary wedge (Gutscher et al., 2002) and olistostrome complex \n\nemplacement (Maldonado et al., 1999) that results in a wide development of the \n\ncontinental slope and rise in this area. \n\nThe northern continental margin of the Gulf of Cadiz extends from the Gibraltar \n\nstraight, to the West of Tarifa, until Cape Saint Vicente. The southern continental margin \n\nof the Gulf of Cadiz extends from Tangier to North of Casa Blanca, to the on-land \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 1. Introduction \n\n \n\n 4 \n\nprolongation of the Rharb Valley that defines the southern limit of the Accretionary wedge. \n\nIn this continental margin several sectors can be defined, with different shelf, slope and \n\nrise characteristics. These characteristics are controlled by tectonic, diapiric and \n\nsedimentary/erosive processes related to slump processes and related to the strong effect of \n\nthe outflow of the Mediterranean Water (MW) on the seafloor. \n\nThe continental shelf in this area has a variable width but it is in general fairly wide \n\n(ranging from 10 to 50 km) with the exception of the Gibraltar strait where it is less than 8 \n\nkm wide. The slope of the continental shelf (out of the Gibraltar strait area) can reach up to \n\n0.5\u00ba, but it is flatter (0.3\u00ba) in the Moroccan and Spanish margins. The shelf break occurs at \n\ndepths ranging from 100 to 200 m. In the Portuguese margin it is located at about 130 m \n\nexcept offshore Faro where it is found at about 100 m water depth. To the West of Faro, in \n\nthe Spanish margin, the depth of the shelf break is located between 140 and 150 m \n\ndiminishing again to the South of Cadiz (Vanney and Mougenot, 1981). \n\n \nFigure 1.1.

They are characterized by an irregular seafloor morphology shaped by active \n\nsedimentary and tectonic processes. The South Portuguese margin to the West of Faro is \n\ncharacterized by the presence of several incisive canyons that shape this sector of the \n\nmargin. To the East of Faro, the Spanish and Moroccan margins are characterized by the \n\naccretionary wedge/olistostrome complex domain. The upper slope, between 130 and 400 \n\nm water depth, is narrow and characterized by depositional processes related to the \n\nprograding edge of the continental shelf break, erosive processes related to the canyons and \n\nchannels, gravitational structures related to slumping processes, tectonic processes \n\nrevealed by recent fractures and diapiric processes, gas-charged sediments and fluid escape \n\nstructures as pockmarks (Baraza and Ercilla, 1996). The middle slope, from 400 to 1200 m \n\nwater depth, is characterized by its large extension except in the South Portuguese margin, \n\nin the Portim\u00e3o and Faro Canyons area, where it is narrower. It is characterized by the \n\nstrong erosive/depositional influence of the Mediterranean Outflow (MO) with large \n\ncontourite deposits and erosive channels (Hernandez-Molina et al., 2003). The central part \n\nof this area is characterized by the presence of important ridge systems associated with \n\ndiapiric structures with a preferential NE-SW direction and by the occurrence of mud \n\nvolcanoes and other fluid escape structures that are frequent in this domain (Figure 1.2). \n\nThe lower slope, ranging from 1200 to 4000 m water depth, shows a large extension on the \n\naccretionary/olistostrome domain but, on the South Portuguese margin West of Faro, in the \n\nsector dominated by the presence of canyons, the middle and lower slopes are narrower. \n\nThe dominant seafloor morphology within the accretionary domain is characterized by the \n\npresence of small-scale bottom features such as mini-basins, some of them with polygonal \n\nshapes, mud volcanoes and salt diapirs. The Horseshoe and Seine abyssal plains have flat \n\nseafloor morphologies. The Horseshoes Abyssal Plain is limited to the North by the \n\nGorringe Bank and to the South by the Ampere and Coral Patch seamounts which, together \n\nwith the Coral Patch Ridge define the northern limits of the Seine Abyssal Plain. In the \n\nEast, both abyssal plains are limited from the continental rise by scarps. The Horseshoe \n\nAbyssal plain is limited to the East by the Horseshoe fault that delimits a domain of the \n\nfoot of the rise that has a gentle and constant slope, limited to the East by the accretionary \n\nwedge deformation front scarp. The Seine Abyssal plain is limited by the accretionary \n\nwedge deformation front scarp (Figure 1.2).  \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 1. Introduction \n\n \n\n 6 \n\n \nFigure 1.2.

The specific scientific objectives of this thesis are: \n\n1. To identify and to describe the morphology and characteristics of the fluid escape \n\nstructures in the Gulf of Cadiz, especially the occurrences of MDAC and to \n\ninvestigate their possible structural control and their relationship with major fluid \n\nescape structures; \n\n2. To identify the various types of MDAC observed in the study area and to \n\ncharacterize their mineralogy and geochemistry, in order to establish the main \n\nphysical, chemical and bio-geochemical processes involved in their formation; \n\n3. To investigate the role of hydrocarbon-rich fluid venting in the formation of the \n\nMDAC; \n\n4. To investigate the role of microbial consortia on the anaerobic oxidation of \n\nmethane and the precipitation of the MDAC; \n\n5. To determine the age and growth rates of the MDAC; \n\n6. To identify any major episodes of formation and to correlate them with past \n\nclimate changes and eustatic sea-level fluctuations; \n\n7. To propose a model of formation for the different MDAC. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.4 Database \n\n \n\nThe database for this PhD Thesis consists of data collected largely by the author \n\nfrom 14 scientific cruises: TTR09, TTR10, TTR11A, TTR11, TTR12, TTR14, TTR15, \n\nTTR16, Anastasya-2000, Anastasya-2001, GAP, Cadipor, Matespro and Delila (see details \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 1. Introduction \n\n \n\n 8 \n\nin Appendix A). During these cruises a large dataset was collected in the Gulf of Cadiz, \n\nincluding seismic lines (that were added to the previous existing seismic dataset), side-scan \n\nsonar data (both surface and deep-towed), heat flow, multibeam bathymetry, underwater \n\nvideo observations and a large number of sediment and rock (mud breccia clasts and \n\nMDAC) samples, from gravity cores, dredges and grabs. A description of the different \n\ngeophysical data, its acquisition parameters and processing, and a description of the sample \n\ncollection and underwater video observation equipments are presented in Appendix A. For \n\nthis thesis, about 2700 km of seismic reflection profiles were used, together with more than \n\n2700 km of ecosounder profiles, 58422 km2 of low resolution side-scan sonar, and 578 km2 \n\nof high resolution deep-towed side-scan sonar. Multibeam bathymetry data from 5 surveys \n\nwas used for the construction of regional and detailed bathymetric 3D models. 331 \n\nsampling stations (including gravity cores, TV-grabs and dredges) and 70 underwater \n\nvideo observation profiles were used to constrain the nature of seafloor and sub-seafloor. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.5 Methodology \n\n \n\nAll the data collected in the Gulf of Cadiz, relative to geophysical investigations, \n\nvideo observations and retrieved samples, was integrated into a Geographic Information \n\nSystem (GIS) database. The positioning of all the data acquisition operations was \n\ncalculated and integrated on the GIS database, together with information relative to the \n\nacquired data and subsequent analytical results. This allowed the analysis and \n\ninterpretation of all the georeferenced data and the investigation of relationships between \n\nthe different datasets. The GIS database allowed the location, characterization and \n\ninterpretation of the fluid escape structures morphology, elaboration of 3D models and \n\nmap production. GIS analyse tools applied on the database were used to investigate the \n\nspatial relationships between the different fluid escape structures and the geological, \n\ntectonic and oceanographic settings. \n\nTo identify and characterize the different types of MDAC and to establish their \n\nformation processes, the different samples were described in hand-specimens, under \n\nbinocular and by thin section petrographic and cathodoluminescence microscopy. The \n\n\n\n \n\nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 9\n\nmineralogy was determined and quantified by X-ray diffraction and chemical analysis \n\n(total carbon content, total organic carbon and carbonate content). Carbon and oxygen \n\nstable isotopic composition of selected samples where also determined as the strontium \n\nisotopic compositions of the representative MDAC types. \n\nBased on the mineralogical and geochemical characterization of the MDAC, the \n\nnature of the hydrocarbon-rich diagenetic fluids involved in their formation was \n\ninvestigated and estimated together with other environmental properties (temperature of \n\nformation and geochemical setting). \n\nThe presence and the active role of microbes involved in the formation of the MDAC \n\nwas interpreted based on the mineralogy, texture and microfabric of the carbonates, as \n\ninvestigated on petrographic microscopy, complemented with cathodoluminescence \n\ncharacterization and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The active role of microbial \n\nconsortia on the anaerobic oxidation of methane and precipitation of the MDAC was \n\ninvestigated by stable carbon isotopic composition of the different carbonate phases and by \n\nthe determination of the presence of characteristic biomarkers with diagnostic depleted \n\ncarbon isotopic composition. \n\nThe U/Th dating method was used to define the age of formation and growth \n\nvelocities of selected MDAC samples. Their age determinations allowed to estimate the \n\nprocesses potentially involved in their formation, as the climatic changes and eustatic sea-\n\nlevel fluctuations. This method was the one that fitted to the geochemistry of the formation \n\nenvironment and on the estimated time range of the MDAC from the Gulf of Cadiz. \n\nThe different analytical methods and techniques are reported and described in more \n\ndetail within the different chapters, according to their use. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.6 Thesis outline \n\n \n\nThe first chapter presents an introduction to the nature and scope of this research, \n\ndescribes the main objectives, the database and the methodology used. This is followed by \n\na brief outline of the thesis chapters. \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 1. Introduction \n\n \n\n 10 \n\nThe second chapter presents a review of the state of the art and the global \n\nsignificance of fluid escape processes and manifestations at continental margins. \n\nThe third chapter introduces the geological and oceanographical setting of the study \n\narea. The geodynamic setting, the present day seismicity and stress pattern, and the \n\ntectonic regime are then described followed by a short discussion of the nature of the \n\naccretionary prism/olistostrome complex. Next, the paleogeographic and geodynamic \n\nevolution of the Gulf of Cadiz and the geology of the Betic-Rifean Domains and adjacent \n\nbasin are described, as well as the morpho-sedimentary domains in the study area. This \n\nchapter concludes with a description of the present day oceanographic setting of the study \n\narea, with a particular focus on the importance of the Mediterranean Outflow Water on the \n\nseafloor morphology and sedimentary dynamics. \n\nIn Chapter four the characteristics and the distribution of the MDAC occurrences in \n\nthe Gulf of Cadiz are analyzed and correlated with the other fluid escape manifestations \n\nand associated structures (mud volcanoes, diapiric ridges and faults). This includes the \n\ninterpretation of the underwater video profiles and the correlation of the observations and \n\nsamples retrieved with the geophysical and bathymetric data. A cartography of the MDAC \n\noccurrences was produced and the evaluation of the sedimentological and tectonic \n\nprocesses that potentially can control the occurrence of the MDAC and cold seeps in the \n\nGulf of Cadiz are discussed. \n\nChapter five presents the petrographic, mineralogical, geochemical, isotopic and \n\nlipid biomarker studies performed on the MDAC samples collected in the Gulf of Cadiz. \n\nBased on these data, together with the macroscopic sample description and the underwater \n\nvideo observations, a model for the formation of the different authigenic carbonates is \n\nproposed. \n\nChapter six presents a detailed carbon and oxygen stable isotopic study of the \n\nMDAC and a reconstruction of the original pore water composition from which the \n\ndifferent carbonate minerals precipitated. \n\nChapter seven describes the results of the dating of selected samples of MDAC and \n\ntheir interpretation. A link between MDAC formation and the corresponding fluid flow \n\nepisodes are correlated with past oceanographic conditions and eustatic sea-level changes \n\nin the Gulf of Cadiz. \n\n\n\n \n\nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 11\n\nIn chapter eight, the evidences of the microbial mediation in the formation of the \n\nMDAC are investigated, based on textural microscopy interpretation, electron microscopy \n\nobservations and on biomarker analyses. \n\nFinally, Chapter nine presents a summary of the main conclusions presented in the \n\ndifferent chapters, integrated on a regional setting. The thesis concludes with a list of \n\nquestions that could not be covered in this work and new and open questions that arose \n\nduring this research. \n\n\n\n \n\n 12 \n\n \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 13\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 2.  Fluid escape processes and manifestations at \ncontinental margins \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1 Mud volcanism and mud diapirism \n\n \n\n2.1.1 Introduction \n\nMud volcanism, or sedimentary volcanism, as defined by (Kugler, 1933, 1975) is a \n\nworldwide and common geological process. It refers to a series of sedimentary processes \n\nthat result in the episodic extrusion to the surface or to the seafloor of a sedimentary \n\nmixture of gases, water and solid material (mud and clasts) originated from deep sources in \n\nthe sedimentary column (Higgins and Saunders, 1974). Different mud volcanic structures \n\ncan be defined (Brown and Westbrook, 1988; Brown, 1990). Mud volcanoes (MVs) are \n\ndefined as conical shape positive morphological features in relation to the regional \n\ntopography, with a central feeder chimney or conduit and extrusive features such as mud \n\nflows. The mud mounds and mud ridges are defined as positive morphological features, \n\nwith conical shapes but, without any central feeder chimney or extrusive features at the \n\nsurface (Brown and Westbrook, 1988). Therefore, the MVs are formed when a mud rich \n\nmaterial with clasts and other fluids reaches the seafloor or the surface, where extrusive \n\nfeatures (such as mud flows, craters, gryphons, mud pools or salses) will be formed. The \n\nshale or mud diapirs are formed like the mud volcanoes by the intrusion of mud rich fluids \n\nthrough the sedimentary column that can possibly reach the surface, but unlike the mud \n\nvolcanoes, the mud diapirs are characterized by a slow intrusion and ascension of the \n\nmaterial. In the case of the seafloor-piercing mud diapirs, called mud mounds or mud \n\ncones, there will be an absence of the extrusive features that are present on the mud \n\nvolcanoes. In this work the mud cone terminology will be preferably used to name mud \n\nvolcanic structures that were not positively confirmed as mud volcanoes. The difference \n\n\n\nChapter 2.  Global significance of fluid escape processes and manifestations at continental margins and intra-\n\nplate settings \n\n 14 \n\nbetween the mud cones and mud volcanoes is therefore revealed by their surface \n\nexpression. The mud cones show, like the MVs, superficial conical shape morphologies \n\nbut, unlike MVs, they do not exhibit extrusive features such as mud flows, craters or \n\ngryphons. \n\nThe material extruded from the MVs is composed of a fluidized mixture of sediments \n\ndominated by clays, liquids and gases that, in general, incorporates rock fragments (clasts) \n\npulled up from the pierced sedimentary sections. This mixture called a diapiric melange, \n\nargille scaliose or, more commonly, mud breccia (Cita et al., 1981). The mud breccia is \n\ncomposed of a clayish matrix (that can be up to 90% volume) that can contain exotic rock \n\nfragments, called mud breccia clasts, that present a variable lithology, size and shapes, \n\nwhich depends of the nature of the original source layers from where they were pulled up \n\nby the piercing of the mud volcano (Ivanov et al., 1996). \n\nSeveral morphologic elements can be defined on the MVs, such as the mud flows, \n\ncrater and flanks, the surrounding moat, gryphons, mud pools and the feeder channel. The \n\nextrusion of the mud breccia at the surface produces the characteristic out-flowing masses \n\nor mudflows (Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2C). Depending on the viscosity of the material, the \n\nmud flows can be elongated and can travel long distances; if the mud breccia material is \n\nmore viscous, it will produce short mud flows that in general are deposited at a short \n\ndistance from their extrusion point (Figure 2.1B). The stacking of successive mud flows, \n\ngenerally produces topographic conical elevations of variable sizes and shapes, analogous \n\nto the morphology and activity of igneous volcanoes and therefore these features are called \n\nMVs. If the extruded material is very fluid, as a result of high amount of water, then there \n\nwill not be an edification of a conical structure with steep flanks, and the formed edifice \n\nwill preferably have a flat topography with low angle slopes. When the flanks are very flat \n\n(less than 5\u00ba), the structure is preferably named a mud pie (Cita et al., 1981). In general, \n\nthe mud breccia extrudes from a central vent, the feeder channel, chimney or conduit, that \n\nconnects the parent bed of the mud source (the deepest source of the material extruded) to \n\nthe surface of the main crater, or to secondary craters (Figure 2.1). The crater corresponds \n\nto the superficial expression of the central chimney and in general corresponds to a \n\ndepression that results from the post-activity episodes of stress relax and subsidence at the \n\nMV summit. To be noted that the crater can have a diameter that can be significantly larger \n\nthan the diameter of the feeder channel. Mud extrusion can also occur from parasitic vents \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 15\n\nor gryphons (Figure 2.2A, B and C) that can be located within the central crater or on the \n\nflanks of the mud cone edifice (Figure 2.1). At the central crater different types of features \n\ncan occur. It is frequent the formation of gryphons, that correspond to meter size positive \n\nmorphologic conical edifices from witch mud extrusion occurs; mud pools (Figure 2.2D) \n\nthat correspond to depressions where soupy mud is extruded; salses, extrusion of high \n\nsalinity solutions or brines forming pools in depressions. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.1.

The moat corresponds to a depression that totally or partially surrounds \n\nthe base of the mud volcano. The moat can be erosive in origin (consequence of the erosive \n\neffect of currents that contour the mud volcano); it can also result from the over-pressuring \n\nover the surrounding sediments, consequence of the overburden of the mud volcano \n\nedifice; alternatively the moat can be formed as consequence of the stress release after the \n\nmud volcano activity and edification; or can result from the collapse or depression of \n\nsedimentary layers as result of the remotion of sediments from the sedimentary layers \n\nunder the mud volcanic edifice. \n\n\n\nChapter 2.

The MV mud flows can \n\nhave decimetres to kilometres in length. Four types of MV activity have been recognized \n\non land in Azerbaijan (State Oil of the Republic of Azerbaijan (SOCAR), 1996; Fowler et \n\nal., 2000). These are: (1) Explosive activity, characterized by violent extrusion of large \n\namounts of mud breccia with high amounts of mud breccia clasts and powerful flow of gas \n\nthat spontaneously ignites producing explosions of variable strength; (2) Effusive activity, \n\nwith the ejection of large amounts of mud breccia with or without less non-ignited gas \n\nemissions; (3) Effusive activity with the outflow of low viscosity mud breccias and without \n\nintense gas emissions; (4) Extrusive activity that corresponds to the slow extrusion of \n\nviscous mud with negligible emission of gas. Submarine MVs can have different activity \n\ncharacteristics but, most probably, episodes of powerful and rapid extrusion of large \n\nvolumes of mud breccias possibly accompanied by gas release will alternate with quieter \n\neffusive episodes of fluidized mud breccia eruption with small amounts of gas. As \n\nillustrated in Figure 2.1, the different episodes can succeed over long periods of the MV \n\nactivity and can intercalate with periods of MV inactivity (Graue, 2000). Fluid and gas \n\nemissions are commonly associated with MVs, but can also occur outside the mud edifice, \n\nalong deep faults. These gases are expelled at localized venting sites, either as free gas in \n\nthe case of terrestrial MVs (Figure 2.2E) or, in the case of submarine MVs as dissolved in \n\npore waters, trapped as gas hydrates or as free gas (even in the gas hydrate stability zone \n\ngas can be preserved as free gas and not completely crystallized as gas hydrate). \n\nThe mud volcano morphology is a function of its past activity and evolution, local \n\nlithology and of the tectonic framework of the host sediments. Therefore, there is no strict \n\nand universal classification for MVs but, based on the classification defined for land MVs, \n\nthree types of MVs were defined by Kalinko (1964) and Dimitrov (2002), based on their \n\nmorphology and eruptive activity. The Lokbatan type corresponds to MVs with frequent \n\nexplosive activity, as a consequence of the rapid eruption of low viscosity mud breccias \n\nwith abundant clasts and high amounts of gas. The morphology corresponds to well \n\ndeveloped steep conical shapes. The activity episodes are short and alternate with longer \n\nperiods of inactivity. Blocking of the feeder chimney by mud breccia clasts and high \n\n\n\nChapter 2.  Global significance of fluid escape processes and manifestations at continental margins and intra-\n\nplate settings \n\n 18 \n\nviscosity mud breccia is frequent, forming a mud cork and the fluid pressure increases \n\nbelow it. When the fluid pressure overcomes the resistance of the mud cork the MV retakes \n\nthe activity with an explosive episode. Once the pressure is released the feeder chimney \n\ncan be blocked again until the repetition of the process. This activity favours the \n\nedification of complex morphologies with secondary feeder chimneys and abundant \n\ngryphons. The Chikishlyar type corresponds to MVs with continuous and relatively weak \n\nand not violent extrusive activity. This type of MV is strongly affected by the presence of \n\nwater saturated layers and in general forms numerous vents of gassy mud and water. They \n\nform very low or flat domes. The Schugin type corresponds to a transitional type of MV \n\nactivity, with intermediate characteristics between the two previous types. The eruptive \n\nperiods are replaced by weak activity. This type of MV is characterized by a great variety \n\nof forms, but most commonly they build composite craters. \n\nThe submarine mud volcanoes are difficult to classify and not always fit the Kalinko \n\n(1964) classification types. However, some assumptions can be made, based on their \n\nmorphology character such as the shape of the MV, the structure of the crater, the shape \n\nand characteristics of the mud flows, etc. (Ivanov et al., 1996). Recent activity episodes \n\ncan be identified by several peculiarities, most prominent at the summit of the MV, such \n\nas: fluid emissions (visible as gas bubbling, water discharge, diffusive flux, gas hydrates \n\npresence); biological indicators (bacterial mats and chemosynthetic communities); \n\ngeological indicators (carbonate build-ups of methane-derived authigenic carbonates, \n\nrecent mud breccia at the seafloor); geophysical and geochemical anomalies (such as \n\nthermal anomalies, high geothermal gradient, pore fluid and pore water chemical \n\nanomalies). \n\nIn the literature, several terms (diatreme, gas dome, mud lump, mud mound, mud \n\npot, mud cone) have been proposed as synonyms for the different main mud volcanic \n\nstructures: mud volcanoes, mud diapirs, seafloor-piercing mud diapirs and mud ridges. In \n\nthis work, the term mud volcano will be used to identify mud volcanic structures that, as \n\nconfirmed by ground truthing, are characterized by a the presence of mud breccia (that can \n\nbe covered by a layer of pelagic sediments with variable thickness) and high fluid and high \n\ngas (essentially methane) contents, or the geophysical data shows without a doubt the \n\nextrusive activity of the MV (e.g. high backscatter mud flows). Structures that show \n\ngeophysical and morphologic characteristics similar to MVs but were not sampled, or \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 19\n\nwhere sampling did not clearly reveal the presence of mud breccia or high fluid and \n\nmethane contents, are preferably classified here as mud cones. As such, mud cones \n\ncorrespond to either seafloor-piercing diapirs or to MVs (when they were not confirmed by \n\nsampling or sampling was not conclusive due to e.g. a thick pelagic sedimentary cover \n\nover a MV inactive for a long period of time). The mud diapirs are intrusive structures \n\n(emplaced during a longer span of time than the MVs) that on seismic profiles can exhibit \n\nmud volcanic similar seismic facies with acoustic chaotic reflection patterns but that do not \n\nreach the seafloor and pelagic sediment layers are identified on top of it or, if they are \n\npiercing to the seafloor they do not show evidences of extrusion of mud breccias or other \n\nextrusive features. \n\n \n\n2.1.2 Formation mechanisms \n\nMud volcanism corresponds to the ascent of buried sediments as the result of density \n\ninversion or buoyancy forces (Brown, 1990) and pore fluids overpressure generated on \n\nburied sediments. The mud ascension and extrusion to the surface will occur whenever the \n\npore fluid pressure exceeds the lithostatic pressure, causing hydraulic fracturing. The \n\nmechanisms through which buried sediments can ascend and form MVs are related with: \n\n(1) high pore fluids and gas pore pressures developed within the sedimentary sequences \n\n(Kugler, 1933; Ridd, 1970; Hedberg, 1974; Kugler, 1975; Milkov, 2000); (2) density \n\ninversions within the sedimentary sequences (Brown, 1990); (3) tectonic loading resulting \n\nfrom lateral tectonic shortening, accretion and overthrusting (Higgins and Saunders, 1974); \n\n(4) occurrence of diapiric structures or anticlinal folds and the occurrence of faults, along \n\nwhich the ascension and migration of fluidized sediments can occur (Brown, 1990). \n\nThe development of the necessary high pore fluid pressure to induce the migration of \n\nthe fluidised sediments can be reached as a result of several processes, some of them acting \n\nsimultaneously, such as: (i) tectonic loading resulting from lateral tectonic shortening, \n\naccretion and overthrusting; (ii) sediment loading (resulting from high sedimentation rates, \n\nslumps, debris flows or overriding thrust sheets); (iii) diagenetic reactions of dehydration \n\n(such as smectite to illite and montmorilonite to illite dehydration (Brown et al., 2001) and \n\nopal A to opal CT diagenetic transformation); (iv) hydrocarbon formation and changes of \n\nphase of the hydrocarbons such as reactions of creaking of heavier hydrocarbons into \n\n\n\nChapter 2.  Global significance of fluid escape processes and manifestations at continental margins and intra-\n\nplate settings \n\n 20 \n\nlighter hydrocarbons; and (v) hydrothermal pressuring (Barber et al., 1986; Dimitrov, \n\n2002; Kopf, 2002). Fluidization and subsequent rapid flow of pore fluids through the \n\nsedimentary column can be reached through gas expansion, gas and water flux and \n\nshearing stresses (Brown, 1990). Over-pressuring of light, plastic, undercompacted fined-\n\ngrained layers from deeper sedimentary sections is the major factor for the formation of \n\nMVs. Most of these causes are closely related to each other and, in general, occur \n\nsimultaneously. \n\n \nFigure 2.3. Schematic diagram illustrating the different basic mechanisms of formation of submarine MVs \n\n(from Milkov, 2000). (A) seafloor piercing shale diapir without a MV; (B) MV formed on top of a shale \n\ndiapir; (C) seafloor seepage; (D1) MV formed by the rise of a fluidized sediments along a fault connected to \n\nan diapir; (D2) MV formed by the rise of a fluidized sediments along a fault directly connected to the mud \n\nsource bed. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 illustrates the more frequent mechanisms of formation of MVs (Milkov, \n\n2000). Figure 2.3B corresponds to MVs formed directly on top of a seafloor-piercing mud \n\ndiapir as consequence of fluid migration along the body of the diapir (e.g. Ivanov et al., \n\n1996). It should be noted that, during active diapiric stages, the increase of the tectonic \n\npressure will favour MV generation (Rensbergen et al., 1999). \n\nThe most common mechanism of the formation of MVs, corresponds to the rise of \n\nfluidized mud along faults and fractures (situation D1 and D2 in Figure 2.3). The mud \n\nbreccias from these MVs are characterized by high fluid contents. The MVs can be \n\nconnected with diapirs within the sedimentary sequence (case D1 in Figure 2.3) or they can \n\nbe directly connected to the source layers (case D2 in Figure 2.3). Fluid migration plays \n\nthe principal role in this mechanism and, in particular stages of the evolution of the system, \n\nwhen fluids (brine, water or gas) are the main or the only material to migrate, they will \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 21\n\nproduce at the surface not MVs but pockmarks, pockmark structures and methane-derived \n\nauthigenic carbonates (case C in Figure 2.3). \n\n \n\n2.1.3 Detection of submarine mud volcanoes \n\nThere are several methods used for the detection of submarine MVs. Direct methods \n\ninclude: (1) direct observations from a submersible, remotely operated vehicle (ROV) or \n\nthrough underwater video or photo survey that allows the identification of mud breccia \n\nmud flows at the seafloor, and (2) sampling of the seafloor and retrieval of mud breccia \n\nsediment. Indirect methods include: (1) multibeam bathymetric characterization of the \n\nseafloor topography, which allows the identification of positive conical topographic \n\nfeatures (MVs or mud cones); or in some high resolution bathymetric data it is sometimes \n\npossible to identify specific morphologic elements of the MVs, such as the crater, mud \n\nflows and moats; (2) side-scan sonar imagery, which is also a widely used method for the \n\nidentification of submarine MVs, since the mud breccia is characterized by strong \n\nbackscatter returns when compared with the normal seabottom pelagic sediments; (3) MVs \n\nare also detected by reflection seismics (single channel or multi-channel), as the MVs are \n\ncharacterized by having a positive expression and an acoustic transparent or chaotic \n\nacoustic facies on seismic profiles. \n\n \n\n2.1.4 Worldwide distribution \n\nMud volcanoes are found worldwide, onshore and offshore, on continental shelves, \n\ncontinental and insular slopes and in the abyssal parts of inland seas (Figure 2.4). \n\nEstimated total number of known and inferred MVs have been put forward by several \n\nauthors and range from 103 to 105 (Milkov, 2000), to approximately 1800 (Dimitrov, \n\n2002). And estimations of annual amounts of methane globally emanated through MVs are \n\nof the order of ~108 to 2x109 m3 (Kopf, 2002). The technical advances in marine \n\ngeophysical equipment and the increase in deep-water exploration resulted in an increasing \n\nnumber of identified submarine MVs. In spite of the increasing number of underwater \n\nsurveys, the amount of investigated Earth seafloor is still very sparse, and it is therefore \n\nprobable that a very significant number of MV fields are yet to be discovered. \n\n\n\nChapter 2.  Global significance of fluid escape processes and manifestations at continental margins and intra-\n\nplate settings \n\n 22 \n\nMud volcanism occurs predominately at: (1) active margins, compressional tectonic \n\nsettings and accretionary prisms; (2) passive margins associated with thick sedimentary \n\nsequences that have undergone rapid deposition and have become over-pressurized, such \n\nas in deep-sea fans; (3) associated with diapir formation several km bellow the seafloor; \n\nand (4) associated with hydrocarbon provinces, where the above mentioned processes of \n\nhigh pore pressure fluids generation dominate. \n\n \nFigure 2.4. Worldwide occurrence of mud volcanoes, modified after Kholodov (2002), Kopf (2002) and \n\nJudd and Hovland (2007); plate boundaries from Coffin et al (2000). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4 shows a compilation of MV occurrences modified and confirmed from \n\nMilkov (2000), Kholodov (2002), Kopf (2002) and from Judd and Hovland (2007). It can \n\nbe observed that, the MVs occur predominately in active margins, in regions of tectonic \n\ncompressive settings, not only within the limits of the accretionary wedges but also at their \n\ntoe. They also occur along the Alpine-Himalayan collision belt, extending from the Gulf of \n\nCadiz (Kenyon et al., 2000; Gardner, 2001; Kenyon et al., 2001, 2002, 2003; Pinheiro et \n\nal., 2003; Somoza et al., 2003; Depreiter et al., 2005; Rensbergen et al., 2005a; \n\nRensbergen et al., 2005b; Rooij et al., 2005) and the Alboran Sea (Perez-Belzuz et al., \n\n1997; Sautkin et al., 2003; Talukder, 2003), through the Mediterranean Sea (Cita et al., \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 23\n\n1981; Limonov et al., 1994; Ivanov et al., 1996; Limonov et al., 1996; Robertson et al., \n\n1996; Limonov et al., 1997; Woodside et al., 1997a, b; De Lange and Brumsack, 1998; \n\nKopf et al., 1998; Robertson and Kopf, 1998; Woodside et al., 1998; Kopf et al., 2000), in \n\nthe Black and Caspian Seas (Ivanov et al., 1992; Ivanov et al., 1996; Woodside et al., \n\n1997a, b), in the Crimea and Taman peninsulas (Ivanov and Woodside, 1996; Ivanov et al., \n\n1998; Lavrushin et al., 2005), Azerbaijan (which has the biggest land mud volcanoes in the \n\nworld (Hovland et al., 1997; Fowler et al., 2000; Aliyev et al., 2002), Turkmenistan and \n\nIran, as far as into the Makran coast (von Rad et al., 2000; Wiedicke et al., 2001). They \n\nalso occur along collisional zones in most parts of the Indian Ocean, such as the Indonesian \n\nSunda fore-arc (Wiedicke et al., 2002), Sumatra, Borneo (Rensbergen et al., 1999), Timor \n\n(Teixeira, 1950; Gageonnet and Lemoine, 1958; Leme, 1968; Barber et al., 1986). They \n\nalso occur in Taiwan and in the Nankai trench (Yamano et al., 1992; Kuramoto et al., \n\n2001) and in the Barbados accretionary prism (Westbrook and Smith, 1983; Brown and \n\nWestbrook, 1988; Henry et al., 1990; Le Pichon et al., 1990), in the Trinidad island, \n\nColombia, Ecuador, Mexico (Higgins and Saunders, 1974) and in the southern Caribbean \n\nthrust belts (Reed et al., 1990; Vernette et al., 1992), as well as along the northeastern \n\nAmerican coast (Orange et al., 1999). \n\nAt passive margins, MVs are mainly associated with environments with high \n\nsedimentation rates, such as deep sea fans and deltaic systems, like the Niger delta (Graue, \n\n2000), in the Gulf of Mexico (Hovland and Judd, 1988; Prior et al., 1989; Sager et al., \n\n2003), in the Nile deep-sea fan (Mascle et al., 2001), in the Norwegian Sea (Vogt et al., \n\n1999), and in the Orinoco Delta, Eastern Venezuela (Aslan et al., 2001). \n\nAs shown in Figure 2.4, MVs occur mainly in regions where hydrocarbons (oil and \n\ngas) have been or are actively generated, such as the Caspian Sea (Kopf, 2002; Huseynov \n\nand Guliyev, 2004; Yusifov and Rabinowitz, 2004), Trinidad (Higgins and Saunders, \n\n1974), Azerbaijan (Hovland et al., 1997), the Makran accretionary prism (Wiedicke et al., \n\n2001; Delisle et al., 2002; Schluter et al., 2002), the Caucasus, Indonesia (Barber et al., \n\n1986; Barber and Brown, 1988), the Carribean and the North Sea. \n\nThe high number of modern MVs suggests that they should also be frequent in the \n\ngeological record. In fact, some palaeo-cones are imaged at depth on seismic sections \n\n(Fowler et al., 2000), but MV descriptions in the geologic record are scarce. The re-\n\ninterpretation of some chaotic melange deposits, mixtures of blocks in a clay matrix, such \n\n\n\nChapter 2.  Global significance of fluid escape processes and manifestations at continental margins and intra-\n\nplate settings \n\n 24 \n\nas melanges, olistostromes, submarine slumps or debris flow deposits showed that they \n\nwere probably generated from mud volcanism related processes (Barber et al., 1986; \n\nBarber and Brown, 1988). However, the vulnerability towards erosion of these structures \n\nmakes it difficult to preserve them through geological times. \n\n \n\n2.1.5 Global significance, potential interest and environmental impacts \n\nMud volcanism, being a fluid escape process, has a significant role in degassing and \n\ndewatering of buried sediments (Kopf et al., 2001; Dimitrov, 2002); therefore, they \n\ncontribute with an important parcel to the fluid and gas budget and in the geochemical \n\ncycle within the sedimentary basins and in the subduction factory (Kopf and Deyhle, \n\n2002). \n\nInfluence on the global carbon budget \n\nMud volcanoes are also a significant natural source for atmospheric methane, \n\nthrough massive episodic eruptions and dissociation of associated shallow gas hydrates. \n\nThey have an important contribution and an important role on the world greenhouse gas \n\nbudget and their quantification is of significant importance for the climatic change models \n\n(Dimitrov, 2003). \n\nA window to the deep sedimentary section and hydrocarbon potential \n\nAs MVs bring materials originated within the sub-seafloor to the seafloor, they can \n\ngive us direct and indirect information about processes occurring in the deep sub-seafloor \n\n(Ivanov et al., 1996). The study of the mud breccia clasts, since they correspond to rock \n\nfragments pulled up from deeper sections of the sedimentary column to the surface, they \n\nprovide easy access to important information of the deep sedimentary sequences of the \n\nbasin, namely on the composition, genesis, age and geochemistry of the sediments and \n\nprocesses occurring at depth e.g. Akhmanov et al.,(2003); Ovsyannikov et al., (2003). As \n\nmost of the oil and natural gas production areas are associated with mud volcanism, the \n\nMVs were firstly interpreted and studied as direct indicators of hydrocarbon migration, \n\nproviding information of the petroleum potential in the deep subsurface (Ivanov et al., \n\n1998; Stadnitskaia et al., 2006). \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 25\n\nA window to the deep biosphere \n\nThe sub-seafloor sedimentary layers harbour over half of all the prokaryotic cells on \n\nEarth (Whitman et al., 1998). Live sub-seafloor prokaryotes are found even in very old (16 \n\nMa) and deep (> 400 m) sediments (Schippers et al., 2005) and they can have high activity \n\nrates and be active over geological timescales (Parkes et al., 2005). As MVs bring material \n\nfrom the sub-seafloor, they are also a window into the deep biosphere and related bio-\n\ngeochemical processes. They indeed represent an important deep biosphere habitat as they \n\nsupply source energy (CH4 and HS-) that can fuel chemoautotrophic ecosystems. They can \n\nalso transport faunal assemblages from the deep sub-seafloor. \n\nGeological hazards \n\nSubmarine MVs are also important hazardous structures for seafloor operations and \n\ninfrastructures. They can have a damaging impact on drilling operations, rig installations, \n\npipelines and communication routings. \n\nOther scientific issues that can be addressed through the study of MVs are the role of \n\nfluid flow and hydrate dissociation in sediment stability, the interplay between microbial \n\nlife and fluid seepage, and the dynamics of the gas hydrate system. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2. Pockmarks \n\n \n\nPockmarks are negative morphological structures, craterlike or cone shaped \n\ndepressions at the seafloor, that are the expression of high fluid discharge (seepage) \n\nthrough a conduit (Figure 2.5). Seepage in the water column can be manifested by bubble \n\nstreams and columns of coloured or shimmering water. As the migration of fluids through \n\nunlithified sediments has a relatively powerful erosive effect and pockmarks are features \n\nthat record the erosive effect of seepage in suitable types of seabed sediments (Hovland \n\nand Judd, 1988). \n\nPockmarks were described for the first time in the continental shelf of Nova Scotia, \n\nCanada, based on side-scan sonar imagery (King and MacLean, 1970); since then, \n\npockmarks have been recognised not merely as morphologic features, but as indicators of \n\ndynamic geological processes of seepage of fluids at the seabed. The pockmarks occur in a \n\n\n\nChapter 2.  Global significance of fluid escape processes and manifestations at continental margins and intra-\n\nplate settings \n\n 26 \n\nwide variety of geological settings: on continental shelves, slopes, rises and in the deep \n\nocean. \n\nBecause pockmarks can be located relatively easily (inclusive buried pockmarks are \n\ndetectable on reflection seismic records), while seepage activity is more difficult to detect, \n\npockmarks are used as indicators of active or inactive seepage. In general, the pockmarks \n\nare generated by methane, of biogenic or of thermogenic origin, that seeps at the seabed. It \n\nis also possible that some pockmarks are caused by venting of destabilized gas hydrates or \n\ndeep-earth originated gas, but their percentage in this case should be smaller, compared \n\nwith the other fluid supplies, as both fluid supplies should be much less abundant. \n\n \nFigure 2.5.

In this model, the upper boundary of methane hydrates is concordant with the \nsulphate-methane interface (SMI) and gas hydrates can only outcrop in the centre of a pockmark if the \nupward flux of methane is strong enough (Gay et al., 2006c). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 27\n\n2.3 Active hydrocarbon seepage \n\n \n\nThe term seepage embraces a wide spectrum of fluid escape processes that occur on \n\ndifferent geologic settings, both onshore and offshore. Seepage intensity ranges from the \n\nvigorous bubbling of gas (a gas macro seepage) to small scale emanation of microscopic \n\nbubbles, to water dominated fluids or hydrocarbon compounds in solution, detected only \n\nby geochemical instruments. Seepage activity can be continuous or episodically with short \n\nperiods of activity between long periods of dormancy. \n\nThe seeping fluids may be: (1) hydrocarbons (thermogenic or biogenic), that are in \n\ngeneral dominated by methane and light hydrocarbons (as gas or dissolved), although \n\nseepage of heavier compounds can also occur; (2) hydrothermal or volcanic fluids; (3) \n\ngroundwater; (4) fluids resulting from the decomposition of gas hydrates; and (5) deep-\n\nearth gas (such as methane, carbon dioxide and some other compounds that could to be \n\nrising from deep within the Earth, according to the \u201cdeep-earth gas hypothesis\u201d (Gold and \n\nSoter, 1980). \n\nThe seepage of volcanic hydrothermal fluids is a common phenomenon at plate \n\nboundaries and at spreading centres on mid ocean ridges, where submarine volcanic \n\neruptions take place and fluids originated by volcanic activity, modified through fluid \n\ncirculation through volcanic and sedimentary host rocks, are expelled at elevated \n\ntemperatures (up to 350\u00baC) representing positive temperature anomalies in relation to the \n\nambient background temperature values (Corliss et al., 1979). The sites of active volcanic \n\nfluid seepage are called hydrothermal vents. \n\nGroundwater seepage occurs when migration paths, hydrostatic pressure and \n\nadequate aquifer recharge from land results in seepage of meteoric water at the seabed in \n\nareas close to land. Discharge of aqueous fluids resulting from the compaction of \n\nsediments can also be considered as groundwater seepage. \n\nIn general, the occurrence of shallow gas, gas chimneys and gassy sediments are \n\nassociated with cold seepage, gas hydrates, pockmarks or mud volcanoes. The shallow gas \n\nand gassy sediments are recognised on the seismic records by acoustic blanking, acoustic \n\nturbidity and enhanced reflectors (Hovland and Judd, 1988). \n\nThe term cold seeps refers to the sites along convergent plate boundaries and passive \n\ncontinental margins, where near ambient bottom water temperature gas or fluids enriched \n\n\n\nChapter 2.  Global significance of fluid escape processes and manifestations at continental margins and intra-\n\nplate settings \n\n 28 \n\nin hydrocarbons reach the seafloor. This term is defined in opposition to the hydrothermal \n\nseepage or hydrothermal vents, where the seepage fluids are characterized by positive \n\ntemperature anomalies in relation to the ambient seawater. \n\n \n\n2.3.1 Cold seeps: Definition and characteristics \n\nDifferent types of fluids with different hydrocarbons can be expelled at cold seeps: \n\nlight hydrocarbons, as free gas or dissolved (that in adequate pressure and temperature \n\nconditions can for gas hydrates); heavier hydrocarbons, such as oil; water dominated \n\nbrines; and saline brines. Liquid oil seepage, accompanied by light hydrocarbons dissolved \n\nor as gas, occur in general associated with oil reservoirs e.g. Gulf of Mexico (Aharon et al., \n\n1992; Sassen et al., 2003). The leakage of the oil into the water column and into the \n\nsurface waters produces oil slicks that can be observed at the sea surface (Kornacki et al., \n\n1994; MacDonald et al., 2002). Oil and heavier hydrocarbon seepage, campaigned by \n\nasphalt or producing asphalt as result of their oxidation, as observed in the Campeche \n\nKnolls in the southern Gulf of Mexico, can result in lava-like flows of solidified asphalt \n\nassociated with oil seepage, gas hydrates and authigenic carbonates (MacDonald et al., \n\n2004; Hovland et al., 2005a). These asphalt flows are colonized by chemosynthetic \n\ntubeworms and bivalves. \n\nMethane is the dominant hydrocarbon at the majority of cold seeps, in general \n\naccompanied by smaller quantities of CO2, H2S and heavier hydrocarbons such as ethane, \n\npropane, butane and pentane (Hovland et al., 1987; Hovland and Judd, 1988). Methane is \n\nthe second most abundant compound in the sediments (after water) and the global flux of \n\nmethane in the sediment column can have significant importance to the biosphere, \n\nhydrosphere and to the atmosphere. Large amounts of methane are produced in marine \n\nsediments but most of it is consumed within the sediments and does not reach the bottom \n\nwaters or the atmosphere. Methane seeps are places where high flux of methane reaches \n\nthe seabottom and sustains ecological systems and particular geological features. \n\nThree different origins can be considered for methane: microbial, thermogenic or \n\nabiogenic. Microbial methane is generated by bacterial anaerobic decomposition of organic \n\nmatter at low temperatures within the sediments in the anaerobic methanogenic zone, such \n\nas the thermophilic metanogens fermenting VFAs or reducing CO2/formate coupled with \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 29\n\nH2 oxidation (Thauer, 1998). The methanogenic zone is supposed to extend over the first \n\n1000 m below surface (Whiticar, 1999) or even deeper (Ivanov, personal communication). \n\nThermogenic methane is generated by thermo-catalytic breakdown of organic matter \n\n(kerogen) at high temperatures and pressures (of about 110\u00baC) and is usually accompanied \n\nby heavier hydrocarbons. Abiogenic methane can be generated by chemical reactions such \n\nas clay metamorphism, abiogenic reduction of CO2, CO or formate with H2 (Lollar et al., \n\n2002), hydrothermal alteration of sedimentary organic matter (Des Marais et al., 1981), \n\nFischer-Tropsch reactions in aqueous solution at elevated temperature (390\u00baC) in the \n\npresence of metallic catalysts, which is common during the serpentinization and \n\nhydratation of ultramafic rocks (Lollar et al., 1993; Foustoukos and Seyfried Jr., 2004), \n\nmethane generation can also be mediated by deep hydrothermal processes (Hensen et al., \n\nin press; Nuzzo et al., Submitted); and, according to the \u201cdeep-earth gas hypothesis\u201d, \n\nmethane derived from the mantle, where it was an original component of the accretion \n\nEarth (Gold and Soter, 1980). \n\nThermogenic, abiogenic and, to some extent, biogenic hydrocarbons have to migrate \n\nvertically along the sedimentary column from the source rocks and reservoirs to the \n\nseafloor. Gaseous hydrocarbons C1 to C6 are the most mobile and methane having the \n\nsmallest molecular size, is the most mobile and can reach the surface more easily (Hovland \n\nand Judd, 1988). The methane reaching the upper part of the sediment column is in general \n\noxidized anaerobically as described in the section bellow. \n\n \n\n2.3.2 Methane oxidation and main biogeochemical processes in cold \n\nseeps \n\nThe flux of methane from the sediments to the atmosphere is controlled by the \n\nmicrobial-mediated process of anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). AOM is identified \n\nas a major sink of methane (Reeburgh, 1980) and it also accounts for a substantial fraction \n\nof sulphate reduction in marine sediments and in anoxic waters. The identification and \n\nquantification of the mechanisms by which methane is being oxidized in natural \n\nenvironments is very important both in terms of the global carbon budget and for \n\nreconstruction of the relationships between gas hydrate carbon pools and concentrations of \n\ngreenhouse gases in ancient atmospheres (Kvenvolden, 1993; Henriet and Mienert, 1998). \n\n\n\nChapter 2.  Global significance of fluid escape processes and manifestations at continental margins and intra-\n\nplate settings \n\n 30 \n\nAlong the sedimentary column, from depth to the seawater, three main zones (Figure \n\n2.6) with distinctive biogeochemical processes can be defined: the methanogenic zone, the \n\nsulphate reduction zone and the aerobic zone. \n\n \n\n2.3.2.1  The methanogenic zone \n\nThe methanogenic zone is the deepest of the three zones described above and in \n\nnormal marine sediments it is usually located deeper than a few meters bellow the seafloor. \n\nAt seepage sites this zone is pulled up and can occur very close to the seafloor or even \n\nreach the seafloor at very active seepage sites. This zone is anaerobic and methane is \n\ngenerated biologically by methanogenic archaea. Several intermediates of the breakdown \n\nof organic matter, as acetate, are converted to methane, following the simplified reaction \n\nillustrated by equation 2.1. \n \n\n2422 COCHOCH +=      (2.1) \n\n \n\n2.3.2.2  The sulphate reduction zone \n\nThe anaerobic sulphate reduction zone extends from the top of the methanogenic \n\nzone to the bottom of the oxic zone. In general this zone extends few centimetres to few \n\nmeters below the seafloor. At cold seeps the thickness of this zone is highly variable and in \n\nactive seepage systems the sulphate reduction zone can be very thin and is in general \n\npulled up to the seafloor or very close to it. The biogeochemical processes at this zone are \n\ncharacterized by two main reactions: the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) which \n\noccurs in combination with sulphate reduction (SR) according to equation 2.2, and the \n\noxidation of organic matter (equation 2.3). \n\nAOM is the primary process by which biomass is generated and accumulates at \n\nmethane seeps (Boetius et al., 2000; Elvert et al., 2000; Michaelis et al., 2002). AOM has \n\nbeen found to be performed by a consortium of methanotrophic archaea and sulphate-\n\nreducing bacteria (SRB), in which sulphate acts as the terminal oxidant (Boetius et al., \n\n2000). AOM in cold seeps sediments is indicated by geochemical (Thiel et al., 1999; \n\nElvert et al., 2000) and by direct microscopic evidence (Boetius et al., 2000; Orphan et al., \n\n2001). This process is estimated to globally consume the methane equivalent to 5 - 20% of \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 31\n\nthe net modern atmospheric methane flux (20 - 100 x1012 g year-1) (Valentine and \n\nReeburgh, 2000). AOM-SR process is also recognised to be the predominant anaerobic \n\nmethane oxidation metabolic process at methane-seeps in the geologic record (Peckmann \n\net al., 1999a; Peckmann et al., 1999b; Peckmann et al., 1999c; Thiel et al., 1999; Elvert et \n\nal., 2000; Goedert et al., 2000; Valentine and Reeburgh, 2000; Peckmann et al., 2001a; \n\nPeckmann et al., 2001b; Peckmann et al., 2001c; Thiel et al., 2001; Campbell et al., 2002; \n\nMichaelis et al., 2002; Peckmann et al., 2002; Gischler et al., 2003; Goedert et al., 2003; \n\nPeckmann et al., 2003; Peckmann and Thiel, 2004; Peckmann et al., 2004). The \n\nunderstanding of the microbial processes is therefore most important for the understanding \n\nof element cycling at modern and ancient seeps. Ancient methane seepage processes can be \n\nrevealed by geochemical evidence: biomarkers, C and S stable isotopes and microbial-\n\ninduced sedimentary fabrics and microbial precipitates. Stromatolitic fabrics have been \n\nfound at seep deposits as old as the Devonian age (Peckmann and Thiel, 2004). Microbial-\n\ninduced precipitates have been reported from a Tertiary seep limestone (Cavagna et al., \n\n1999; Peckmann et al., 1999b). Fossilised biofilms were recognised in the same limestone \n\n(Peckmann et al., 1999b) as well as in Cretaceous seep deposits which contain structures \n\ninterpreted to represent prokaryotic body fossils (Shapiro, 2004). \n\nThree lines of evidence have traditionally been used to support the existence of \n\nAOM-SR: (i) diagenetic (advection-diffusion-reaction) models of methane concentration \n\nprofiles in anoxic sediments and water column (Barnes and Goldberg, 1976); (ii) tracer \n\nmeasurements using 14C - CH4, 3H - CH4 and 35S - SO42- (Reeburgh, 1980); and (iii) stable \n\nisotope distributions (Whiticar, 1999). \n\nFigure 2.6 schematically summarizes the depth distributions of CH4, total carbon \n\ndioxide (?CO2), sulphate (SO42-) and the stable carbon isotope ratio of carbon dioxide \n\n(?13CO2) in anoxic marine sediments. The distributions of all species show slope changes \n\nor minima at a specific depth, suggesting that most of the methane consumption takes \n\nplace in a thin subsurface depth interval. The ?13CO2 minimum appears to be the result of \n\nlocal injection of methane-derived carbon dioxide. AOM occurs throughout the sulphate \n\nreduction zone (SRZ) reaching the maximum at the base of the SRZ, at the sulphate-\n\nmethane transition zone (SMTZ). The low methane concentration zone observed at the \n\nsurface of marine sediments results from the distribution of anaerobic methane oxidation \n\nrates in the sulphate reduction zone. Methane oxidation rates are highest at the SMTZ. \n\n\n\nChapter 2.  Global significance of fluid escape processes and manifestations at continental margins and intra-\n\nplate settings \n\n 32 \n\nThe anaerobic oxidation of methane has been described geochemically by the \n\nfollowing net reaction (Reeburgh, 1980): \n \n\nOHHSHCOSOCH 23\n2\n\n44 ++?+\n???    (2.2) \n\n \nIt should be noted that, as consequence of AOM-SR, in particular as result of the \n\nsulphate reducing bacteria, the pore water dissolved sulphate is consumed, the alkalinity \n\nincreases and sulphide accumulates in concentrations equivalent to those of sulphate \n\nconsumption. Intense sulphide production supports the occurrence of sulphide-based \n\ncommunities such as Beggiatoa, Calyptogena, bivalves of the families Vesicomydae, \n\nMytilidae, Solemyidae, Thyasiridae and Lucinidae, hosting endosymbiotic \n\nchemoautotrophic bacteria, pogonophoran worms, Cladorhizidae and Hymedesmiidae \n\nsponges (Sibuet and Olu, 1998). In the Gulf of Cadiz the common chemosynthetic \n\ncommunity is composed of Siboglinum sp., Polybrachia and Oligograchia (pogonophora), \n\nAcharax sp. (solemydae) and Lucinoma (Lucinidae) (Cunha et al., 2005; Rodrigues and \n\nCunha, 2005). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.6.

This process will \n\nbe discussed in chapters 5 to 8 of this thesis. \n\nThe microorganisms that mediate this reaction are composed by a consortium of \n\ncertain archaea that are capable of reverse the process of methanogenesis by interaction \n\nwith sulphate-reducing bacteria (Hoehler et al., 1994; Hansen et al., 1998; Hinrichs et al., \n\n1999), with sulphate as the terminal electron accepter, according to equation (2.2). \n\nMicroscopic evidence of the structured consortium of archaea and sulphate-reducing \n\nbacteria, identified by Boetius et al. (2000) using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) \n\nwith specific 16S rRNA-target oligonucleotides has shown that the archaea-bacterial \n\nsymbiosis is structured in dense aggregates in general of about 100 cells (although these \n\naggregates can contain a smaller or a much larger number of cells) of archaea surrounded \n\nby sulphate-reducing bacteria, as illustrated in Figure 2.7. \n\n \nFigure 2.7.

(2000). \n\n \n\nThese aggregates are abundant in gas hydrate rich sediments and in methane seep \n\nareas with high rates of methane-based sulphate reduction. An average archaea/SRB \n\nconsortium, illustrated in Figure 2.7, consists of an inner sphere of 2.3 \u00b1 1.3 \u00b5m diameter \n\ncontaining about 100 coccoid archaeal cells, each 0.5 \u00b5m in diameter. These are partially \n\nor fully surrounded by about 200 cells of SRB (0.3 \u2013 0.5 \u00b5m in diameter), which form an \n\nouter shell of mostly 1-2 cell layers. The size spectrum of 100 archaea/SRB consortia \n\nranged from 1 to 11 \u00b5m in diameter with an average of 3.2 \u00b1 1.5 \u00b5m. The smallest \n\naggregates identified were composed of 1-3 archaea cells and 1-3 cells of SRB, and may \n\nrepresent early stages of the consortium development, while the largest aggregates \n\ncontained about 10000 cells. These consortia are highly abundant in surface sediments at \n\nsulphide concentrations &lt;10 mM, with a maximum of 7x107 aggregates cm-3 at 1-2 cm \n\ndepth (Boetius et al., 2000). \n\n\n\nChapter 2.  Global significance of fluid escape processes and manifestations at continental margins and intra-\n\nplate settings \n\n 34 \n\nThe anaerobic oxidation of organic matter, that can be described by the simplified \n\nequation 3, is the result of different types of bacteria. \n \n\nOHHSCOHCOSOOCH 223\n2\n\n42 +++?+\n???  (2.3) \n\n \nThis reaction produces CO2 and increases the alkalinity in the sediments. Similar to \n\nthe AOM-SR the anaerobic oxidation of organic matter also can drive carbonate \n\nprecipitation and replacement reactions producing calcite and or dolomite. \n\n \n\n2.3.2.3  The aerobic zone \n\nThe aerobic zone extends from the top of the sulphate reduction zone to the seafloor \n\nand within the water column, in normal seawater. In sites of high methane flux, such as \n\nactive mud volcanoes, the oxygenated zone can be of just a few millimetres thick e.g. 4 \n\nmm thick of the aerobic zone at the Captain Arutyunov MV (Pfannkuche and \n\nFahrtteilnehmer, 2006). The aerobic oxidation of methane can be represented by the \n\nfollowing reaction: \n \n\nOHCOOCH 2224 22 +?+  (2.4) \n\n \nIt should be noted that the aerobic oxidation of methane produces CO2 which, \n\nreacting with the H2O, generates H2CO3, reducing the pore water pH and inhibiting the \n\nprecipitation of carbonates, leading to their dissolution. \n\n \n\n2.3.3 Geologic setting and worldwide occurrences of cold seeps \n\nCold seepage is recognized to occur in a diversity of geological and tectonic settings. \n\nThe occurrence of cold seeps is in general associated with other fluid escape structures. \n\nThey are in general directly associated with: mud volcanoes (Brown, 1990; Aloisi et al., \n\n2000; Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2004); mud cones (D\u00edaz-del-R\u00edo et al., 2003); mud diapirs (Brown, \n\n1990); pockmarks (Hovland et al., 1987; Hovland and Judd, 1988); salt diapirs (Acosta et \n\nal., 2003); coral reefs, although not proved and still in debate, a possibly link between \n\nmethane seepage and carbonate mount formation by coral reef Lophelia Pertusa growth \n\nwas been proposed (Hovland, 1990; Hovland and Thomsen, 1997; Henriet et al., 2003); \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 35\n\nseamounts; eroded platforms or escarpments (Paull et al., 1992); faults (Ritger et al., 1987; \n\nKauffman et al., 1996; Rad et al., 1996); polygonal faults, a non-tectonic class of layer-\n\nbound faults that are organized in a polygonal map pattern and are related to sediment \n\ncompaction and fluid expulsion (Gay et al., 2006a; Gay et al., 2006b); sedimentary \n\nstructures, such as sand injections (sandstone dykes and sills), and inclined bedding (Jonk \n\net al., 2003; Mazzini et al., 2003). It should be noted that the sandstone dykes and sills are \n\nnot distinct processes that originate other fluid escape structures but form a related \n\ncontinuum of mobilization features or of fluid escape structures. These structures, when \n\nformed, also represent conduits for preferential fluid transport to the seafloor. \n\nAn worldwide compilation of occurrences of modern and ancient seeps was \n\npresented by Campbell et al., (2002) and is illustrated in Figure 2.8. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.8. World-wide distribution map of modern and ancient (Archaean to recent) hydrothermal vent and \n\nhydrocarbon seep occurrences with chemosynthetic community associations.

Data \n\ncompiled from numerous literature sources (Campbell, 2006). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2.  Global significance of fluid escape processes and manifestations at continental margins and intra-\n\nplate settings \n\n 36 \n\n2.3.4 Cold seepage manifestations and detection \n\nCold seeps, in particular methane seepage can be detected by visual, hydro-acoustic \n\nand by geochemical observations. Visual inspection of the seafloor by submersible/ROV or \n\nunderwater video systems allow the observation of gas hydrates at the seafloor (that \n\nindicate methane flux to the near seafloor where it crystallises as clathrates), plumes of gas \n\nbubbles streams ascending from the seafloor (Figure 2.9A, C, F and G). Gas bubbles can \n\nalso be revealed by acoustic observations, specially the cases of gas hydrate coated \n\nmethane bubbles that can be imagined by echo sounders (Greinert et al., 2006; Sauter et \n\nal., 2006) where they form flares in the water column (Figure 2.9F and G) that can also be \n\nimagined by side-scan sonar (Figure 2.9H). Geochemical profiles of methane (Figure 2.6), \n\nhydrocarbons, clorinity and specific elements allow the measurement of fluxes of \n\nhydrocarbon gas measurements and the calculation of the rates of consumption or seepage \n\nto the bottom waters. \n\nBoth hydrothermal and cold seeps, in general, support chemoautotrophic fauna \n\n(section 2.6) that supports very specific ecosystems that clearly differ from the normal \n\nsurrounding environment. As the distinction between hydrothermal vents and cold seeps is \n\nchemically and geologically simple, the identification of such chemosynthetic communities \n\nis used as a strong indicator of cold seepage on the geological record. \n\nThe most important manifestation of seepage of hydrocarbons is the formation of \n\nmethane-derived authigenic carbonates (MDAC). The deposits of MDAC together with the \n\nidentification of chemosynthetic communities are the most important criteria used to the \n\nidentification of palaeo-cold seeps in the geological record. \n\nFossil cold seep deposits were recognised as far as into the Devonian (Campbell and \n\nBottjer, 1995; Peckmann et al., 1999c; Peckmann et al., 2005). Examples of fossil cold \n\nseeps include the Lower Eocene carbonate cemented chimneys in Varna, NE Bulgaria (De \n\nBoever et al., 2006), the Eocene\u2013Miocene fossiliferous carbonates from Barbados, \n\nTrinidad and northern Venezuela (Gill et al., 2005), the Late Cretaceous in the \n\n(Campanian) submarine springs (Tepee Buttes) of Colorado (Kauffman et al., 1996), the \n\nMiocene Marmorito and Lucina limestones of Monferrato, NW Italy (Clari et al., 1994; \n\nCavagna et al., 1999; Peckmann et al., 1999b; Pierre et al., 2002), the Oxfordian seep \n\ncarbonates from Beauvoisin, southeastern France (Peckmann et al., 1999b), the Upper \n\nJurassic Methane-Seep Limestone from the Fossil Bluff Group Fore-Arc Basin of \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 37\n\nAlexander Island, Antarctica (Kelly et al., 1995), the Miocene fossil seep structures of the \n\nMonterey Bay region (Aiello et al., 2001; Aiello, 2005), the hydrocarbon seep-carbonate \n\noccurrences in late Jurassic to late Cretaceous forearc and accretionary prism strata in \n\nwestern California (Campbell et al., 2002), the Cretaceous cold seep mounds from the \n\nCanadian Arctic (Savard et al., 1996), and others. \n\n \nFigure 2.9.

Global significance of fluid escape processes and manifestations at continental margins and intra-\n\nplate settings \n\n 38 \n\n2.4 Methane-derived authigenic carbonates \n\n \n\nMethane-derived authigenic carbonates (MDAC) are carbonates formed by \n\nmicrobially-mediated processes that occur at the seafloor or in subsurface, at sites of \n\nhydrocarbon-rich fluid seepage (e.g. Hovland et al., 1987; Hovland and Judd, 1988). The \n\nprecipitation of the carbonates is assigned to the sulphate reduction zone or to the transition \n\nbetween the sulphate reduction zone with the methanogenic zone, where the microbial \n\nsulphate reduction is coupled with anaerobic methane oxidation (Ritger et al., 1987; Paull \n\net al., 1992), as described in section 2.3.2. According to the Reeburgh (1980) net equation \n\n(equation 2.2), bicarbonate is produced and increases the alkalinity promoting the \n\nprecipitation of carbonates. The precipitation of carbonate can be envisaged as follows: \n\n \n+\n\n?\n?++ +?+?+ HCOMnMGFeCaHCOMnMgFexxCa xx 313\n\n22 ),,(),,)(1(  (2.5) \n\nwith 0 &lt;x &lt;1. \n\n \n\nThus, for carbonate precipitation to occur, a cation (Ca, Fe, Mg or Mn) is required. \n\nCalcite precipitation occurs when pore fluids are supersaturated with respect to this \n\nmineral. The mineralogy of the carbonate cement is possibly controlled by the geochemical \n\nenvironment such as the concentration of SO42- in pore waters. Strong concentrations of \n\nSO42- in the sediments will inhibit the precipitation of dolomite or Mg-calcite (which are \n\nthe more soluble and thermodynamically more stable), enhancing instead the precipitation \n\nof aragonite. \n\nThe understanding of the formation of dolomite in the MDAC can bring an important \n\ncontribution to the understanding of the so called \u201cdolomite problem\u201d. Dolomite is the \n\nthermodynamically stable carbonate phase in seawater, but it is a rather rare mineral in \n\nmodern marine depositional environments. Nevertheless, dolomite is one of the three most \n\ncommon sedimentary carbonate minerals (Baker and Kastner, 1981). This abundance of \n\ndolomite over the geological record can not be explained by the diagenetic dolomitization \n\nprocess of calcite and aragonite, as there are marked irregularities in the dolomite \n\ndistribution with time. Therefore, dolomite had to be a common, extensive and widespread \n\nrock forming mineral in ancient sediments, in particular in late Precambrian and Paleozoic \n\ntimes, but it is rather scarce in the Holocene (Kastner, 1984). \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 39\n\nThe formulation of the microbial dolomite model (Vasconcelos and McKenzie, 1997; \n\nWarthmann et al., 2000) introduced a biogeochemical approach to the understanding of the \n\ndolomite formation. A plausible correlation was established between the geochemical \n\ncycles and dolomite formation with a positive correlation between extensive dolomitization \n\nperiods and decreased oxygen levels at the oceans and atmosphere (Burns et al., 2000). \n\nThe low oxygen levels would have fostered a more active community of anaerobic \n\nmicrobes, including the sulphate-reducing bacteria, that are involved in mediating the \n\ndolomite nucleation in the formation of dolomite in natural environments (Vasconcelos et \n\nal., 1995). The understanding of the formation process of the authigenic dolomite in cold \n\nseeps environments can contribute to the understanding of the biogeochemical \n\nenvironmental conditions of dolomite formation (see chapters 5, 6 and 7). \n\nThe carbonates in these environments are formed by cementation of seafloor or \n\nshallow sediments by precipitation of authigenic carbonates. The formed carbonates can \n\npresent variable morphologies and shapes: (1) cemented sedimentary layers (Hovland et \n\nal., 1987; Hovland and Judd, 1988) (Figure 2.10, e.g. A to F); (2) thin crusts (few \n\ncentimetres) to thick slabs (up to several meters in size) that pave the seafloor for several \n\nsquare meters (Aloisi et al., 2000; Greinert et al., 2001; Greinert et al., 2002; Magalh\u00e3es et \n\nal., 2005b) (Figure 2.10B, C E and F); (3) irregular edifices and build-ups that can be \n\nseveral meters high (Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2005b) (Figure 2.10A) and that can be formed by \n\nchemical authigenic precipitation (called chemoherms) and by cemented calcareous \n\nskeletal debris of chemo-symbiotic fauna (Aharon, 1994; Clari et al., 1994); (4) chimneys \n\nor pipe-like structures (Kulm et al., 1986; Kulm and Suess, 1990; Aiello et al., 2001; D\u00edaz-\n\ndel-R\u00edo et al., 2003; Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2005b) (Figure 2.10G to I).

The interior of the water cages is occupied by the gas molecules \n\nthat give the stability to the structure (Kvenvolden and Lorenson, 2001). Natural gas \n\nhydrates can have three possible structures: structure I (Figure 2.11G) and II, of the cubic \n\ncrystallographic system, and structure H, of the hexagonal crystallographic system. The \n\ngas hydrate structure depends on the size of the guest gas molecules (Sloan, 1998). \n\nSince 1810, with the discovery of chlorine hydrate by Sir Humphrey Davy, gas \n\nhydrates have been looked as a scientific curiosity, in which gas and water are transformed \n\ninto a solid. Since 1934, with the recognition of the occurrence of gas hydrate plugs in \n\npipelines, gas hydrates started to be looked as a hazard concern in the gas and oil industry. \n\nFrom the mid-1960s, with the discovery of natural gas hydrates in deep oceans, permafrost \n\nregions and also in extraterrestrial environments, gas hydrates started to be of increasing \n\ninterest in the geosciences (Sloan, 1998). The first recognition of natural gas hydrates was \n\nin 1965 in the Siberian permafrost, northern Russia (Makogon et al., 1971). On the seabed \n\nenvironment, gas hydrates were later inferred from pore water analysis during the DSDP \n\nLeg 11 drill in the Blake Ridge, in the early 1970s (Lancelot and Ewing, 1972). More \n\ndiscoveries were reported from the Black Sea (Yefremova and Zhizhchenko, 1974), from \n\nthe Caspian Sea (Ginsburg and Soloviev, 1998), from the MacKenzie Delta and offshore \n\nMexico (Shipley et al., 1979; Shipley and Didyk, 1982). Since then, gas hydrates have \n\nbeen increasingly recognised in many offshore areas of both active and passive margins. \n\n\n\nChapter 2.  Global significance of fluid escape processes and manifestations at continental margins and intra-\n\nplate settings \n\n 42 \n\nNatural gas hydrates can be formed and are stable in conditions illustrated in Figure \n\n2.11H, which depend on the temperature, pressure, the chemistry (salinity) of the pore \n\nwater and the composition of the guest gas molecules. Favourable conditions for the \n\nformation of natural gas hydrates occur over a grater part of the shallow subsurface of the \n\nEarth beneath the ocean at water depths exceeding about 500 m (shallower beneath colder \n\nArtic seas) and on land beneath high-latitude permafrost. Gas hydrates will be present in \n\nsuch conditions only if there is adequate water within the sediments to form the host \n\nmolecules, and the adequate supply of gas (in general methane). In the Artic, gas hydrate \n\noccurrences are often associated with petroleum deposits, whereas at continental margins, \n\nwhere the greatest amounts of gas hydrate occur, the gas is mainly microbial in origin. The \n\nocean margins are characterized by the greatest flux of organic carbon to the seafloor \n\nbecause of the high biologic productivity and the highest organic detritus accumulation \n\nfrom the continents. Furthermore, continental margins are characterized by high \n\nsedimentation rates that have the effect of covering and sealing the organic material \n\npreventing it from being oxidized. Latter microbial degradation of the organic mater in the \n\nsediments produces methane which, if the pressure and temperature conditions are \n\nappropriated, will form gas hydrates. \n\n \n\n2.5.2 Significance \n\nNatural gas hydrates (GHs) are of great importance and their formation/dissociation \n\ncan constrain several sedimentological processes. \n\nThe dissociation of GHs can create overpressures in the sediments that can trigger \n\nlandslides (Huhnerbach and Masson, 2004), blowouts, seafloor collapse events and \n\nseafloor mass movements that represent a potential geohazard for seafloor pipelines, oilrig \n\nanchors and other seafloor structures (Hovland and Gudmestad, 2001). The dissociation of \n\nGHs during drilling operations can cause sediment mobilization and represent also a safety \n\nhazard for seafloor and sub-seafloor operations. Moreover, GHs in sediments are sensitive \n\nto small temperature changes. A temperature increase of 1.0-1.5\u00baC has the potential to \n\ncause gas hydrate (GH) dissociation. Small fluctuations in fluid flow were also recorded at \n\nthe tidal frequency, indicating that very small perturbations in the ambient pressure \n\nconditions may lead to GH dissociation. \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 43\n\nThe proximity of the GH methane reservoir to the seafloor and its restricted \n\nthermodynamic stability domain has motivated large speculations about the release of \n\nmethane in response to climatic changes (MacDonald, 1990). Increases of seabottom \n\ntemperature (as result of regional oceanographic condition changes) and decreases in \n\npressure (e.g. through sea level changes) can destabilize GHs, releasing methane into the \n\nnear-surface environment and having an important impact on the carbon cycle (Buffett and \n\nArcher, 2004; Archer and Buffett, 2005). According to the \u201cclathrate gun\u201d hypothesis \n\n(Kennett et al., 2003), episodic emissions of methane to the atmosphere (a powerful \n\ngreenhouse gas), as a consequence of the destabilisation of GH reservoirs may have had \n\nsignificant impact on past climatic changes (Kennett et al., 1996; Judd et al., 1997; Kennett \n\net al., 2000; Judd et al., 2002; Judd, 2003; Kennett et al., 2003; Judd, 2004). \n\nIn particular sites, where GHs may occur in adequate concentrations, GHs may also \n\nbe a significant energy resource as a hydrocarbon fuel. Mud volcanoes are one of these \n\nparticular sites where GHs can occur in high concentrations. \n\nGas hydrates may also play an important role on the distribution of chemosynthetic \n\ncommunities (Carney, 1994), as revealed during the ODP Leg 164 at Blake Ridge where \n\nhigh bacterial activity were reported near the bottom simulating reflector (BSR) \n\n(Wellsbury et al., 2000) demonstrating that the sediments near the BSR form a \n\nbiogeochemical dynamic zone. \n\n \n\n2.5.3 Detection \n\nWhile gas hydrates have been recovered and directly observed at the seafloor, they \n\nare generally identified in the marine environment through geochemical and geophysical \n\n(mainly seismic) indirect evidences. \n\nThe geochemical indicators consist of decreases of the interstitial water chlorinity \n\nvalues, stable isotopic 18O-enrichment of the pore waters, and salinity and temperature \n\nanomalies registered along gravity cores and boreholes (Hesse and Harrison, 1981; \n\nDavidson et al., 1983; Hesse et al., 2000; Hesse, 2003). During the crystallization of the \n\nhydrates, like in the formation of ice, salt ions are excluded from the solid structure and \n\nthere is a preferential uptake of the heavy isotopes. During the retrieval of gas hydrate \n\n\n\nChapter 2.  Global significance of fluid escape processes and manifestations at continental margins and intra-\n\nplate settings \n\n 44 \n\nbearing cores, the destabilization of the gas hydrates releases fresh water that produces the \n\nchlorinity and salinity anomalies associated with 18O-enrichement of the pore waters. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.11.

(H) Scheme illustrating the conventional model for GH stability and bottom simulating \nreflectors in submarine sediments. The base of the hydrate stability is marked by a univariant phase boundary \nas temperature increases with depth. At this point methane in excess of solubility in pore water may exist as \nfree gas and potentially produce a distinct seismic reflector due to the reduced velocity (Clennell et al., \n1999). (I) BSR seismic record over Cascadia Margin, also illustrating the methane plumes over the seepage \narea (Suess et al., 1999). \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 45\n\nGeophysical evidence of gas hydrates are the so called gas hydrate-related bottom-\n\nsimulating reflectors (BSRs) detected with seismic reflection methods (Figure 2.11H and \n\nI). The BSR are a class of seismic reflectors that cross-cut sedimentary strata and that are \n\ngenerally related to processes that occur after the deposition of the sediments. The BSRs \n\nare caused by processes depending on sub-bottom depth, which in turn influences the \n\npressure and the temperature within the sediments. A common BSR not related with GH is \n\ncaused by the diagenetic transformation of opal A to opal CT and quartz. This process \n\nresults in a positive acoustic impedance contrast between the silicate rich sediments with \n\ndifferent diagenetic evolution stages (Kastner et al., 1977). In the mid-Norwegian margin, \n\na similar diagenetic-related BSR has been observed underneath the opal A to opal CT \n\ntransition and interpreted as resulting from the diagenetic smectite to illite transformation \n\nor as resulting from an increase in the abundance of authigenic carbonates (Berndt et al., \n\n2004). These diagenetic-related BSRs have the same polarity as the seafloor reflection, a \n\ncriteria that differentiates this class of BSRs from the gas hydrate-related BSRs. \n\nThe gas hydrate-related BSRs are formed as a consequence of the acoustic contrast \n\nbetween the relatively high velocity hydrate-charged sediments within the gas hydrate \n\nstability zone, bellow which is located a low velocity gas charged sediments, where free \n\ngas can occur underneath the gas hydrate stability zone (Singh et al., 1993). The gas \n\nhydrate-related BSR corresponds to a reflection caused by these negative impedance \n\ncontrasts (Pecher et al., 1996). The gas hydrate-related BSRs present four main \n\ncharacteristics: (1) The depth of the BSR bellow the seafloor is more or less constant, \n\nindicating that the BSR is temperature dependent rather than pressure dependent; (2) the \n\nBSRs are anomalously high reflective events, indicating an abrupt change in the acoustic \n\nimpedance, i.e., a strong contrast in density and/or sound velocity with depth; (3) the BSRs \n\noften cross-cut the lithological reflections, indicating that it is a diagenetic feature \n\n(fluid/gas), rather than related to changes in lithology; (4) the BSRs present a reverse \n\nacoustic polarity with respect to the seafloor reflection, indicating that the P waves are \n\nbeing reflected from a boundary with an negative impedance contrast, i.e., where in \n\ngeneral the density is reduced and/or the sound velocity is reduced with depth. \n\nSedimentary strata below the BSRs are usually more strongly defined i.e. enhanced, \n\ncompared to those above, where the lithological layers are weakly reflective. This upper \n\n\n\nChapter 2.  Global significance of fluid escape processes and manifestations at continental margins and intra-\n\nplate settings \n\n 46 \n\nzone is therefore referred to as seismically transparent or blanking zone and, it is suspected \n\nto be caused by hydrate cementation and its relatively high acoustic velocity. \n\nAlthough the gas hydrate-related BSRs are widely interpreted as in situ gas hydrates \n\nindicators, they are not necessary and always adequate indicators of gas hydrates and their \n\nabsence does not exclude the possibility to find gas hydrates. Some areas with gas hydrates \n\ndo not have BSRs and in some areas drilling through BSRs failed to find gas hydrates. Off \n\nthe coast of Norway, where drilling through BSRs had failed to find gas hydrates, it was \n\nproposed that the observed BSR represented a palaeo-BSR, and although the gases and gas \n\nhydrates may once have been present, they are no longer there in significant quantities, in \n\nspite of the fact that the diagenetic and consequently acoustic properties changes induced \n\nby the BSR are still present. \n\nIn conclusion, BSRs can be interpreted as representing a physicochemical and a \n\nbiogeochemical intense reaction zone, where gas hydrates are formed above the BSR in the \n\ngas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) and free gas occurs below it. \n\n \n\n2.5.4 Occurrences \n\nNatural gas hydrates occur worldwide in oceanic sediments of continental and insular \n\nslopes and rises of active and passive margins, in deep-water sediment of inland lakes and \n\nseas, and in polar sediment on both continents and continental shelves. Their occurrence is \n\ncontrolled by the conjugation of factors that include temperature, pressure and the \n\ncomposition of the gas and water (Kvenvolden, 1993). In marine sediments, gas hydrates \n\nare found where the water depths that exceed about 300 m and the bottom water \n\ntemperatures approach 0\u00b0 C, found at the seafloor down to sediment depths of about 1100 \n\nm. In polar continental regions of permafrost, gas hydrates can be present in sediments at \n\ndepths between about 150 and 2000 m (Kvenvolden and Lorenson, 2000, 2001). As can be \n\nseen from Figure 2.12 and comparing it with the global occurrences of mud volcanism \n\n(Figure 2.4) and cold seeps (Figure 2.8), it is possible to conclude that many of these \n\nlocations coincide, putting in evidence the interconnection between all the different fluid \n\nescape occurrences and manifestations. \n\n \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 47\n\n \nFigure 2.12. Global occurrences of natural gas hydrates in the ocean floor (dots) and permafrost (dashed \n\npolygons). Modified from Kvenvolden and Lorenson (2000), with additions. \n\n \n\n2.5.5 Global estimations \n\nEstimates of methane trapped as gas hydrates in the sediments of continental margins \n\nare very variable and speculative, and have been subject of debate for many years. The \n\nmost widely cited estimate of global gas hydrates of 21x1015 m3 of methane at a standard \n\ntemperature and pressure (STP), or 10 000 Gt of methane carbon (Kvenvolden and \n\nLorenson, 2001), has been proposed as a consensus value from several independent \n\nestimations. This amount may represent 3000 times the amount of methane in the present-\n\nday atmosphere. It may also represent twice the amount of all fossil fuels on Earth. This \n\nlarge reservoir value suggests that the gas hydrates are a potentially important future \n\nenergy source, a likely source of geohazards and an important component of the global \n\ncarbon cycle. \n\nRecent improvements in the constraining parameters of the gas hydrate estimations \n\n(direct measurements of gas concentrations in the sediments and by the DSDP/ODP/IODP \n\ndrilling) have significantly diminished the global gas hydrate estimates to the range 1-\n\n5x1015 m3 or ~500 \u2013 2500 Gt of methane carbon (Milkov, 2004). This implies that the role \n\nof gas hydrates in the global carbon cycle may not be as significant as speculated \n\npreviously, but still not neglectable. The destabilization of gas hydrates can induce the \n\nrelease of potential large volumes of methane (given the global estimates of gas hydrates), \n\n\n\nChapter 2.  Global significance of fluid escape processes and manifestations at continental margins and intra-\n\nplate settings \n\n 48 \n\nthat will input significant amount of carbon to the ocean/atmosphere, a process important \n\nenough to unbalance the carbon cycle. During the geological record this process is \n\nrecognized as having a important role in the global carbon cycle and that could have \n\ntriggered rapid climatic changes such as the intense global warming at the \n\nPaleocene/Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) (Schiermeier, 2003). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.6 Associated ecosystems \n\n \n\nSince their discovery, chemoautotrophic or methanotrophic-based communities \n\nassociated with seafloor seepage have been found in various settings and appear to be \n\ncommon along continental margins. Chemosynthetic primary production forms the base of \n\nthe hydrocarbon seep community food web. These comprise the sulphate-reducing \n\nbacteria, methanogens, methane and sulphide oxidizing bacteria. \n\nThe most characteristic and indicative seep biota consists of bacterial mats, \n\npogonophorans (Figure 2.13A-C) and Vestimentifera tubeworms, mollusca modiolid \n\nmussels, lucinid and vesicomyid clams (Figure 2.13D-F). Their presence indicates the \n\nexpulsion of hydrocarbon-rich fluids. Certain types of bivalves are frequently used for the \n\ndetection of active seepage sites by visual inspection due their large size, their light colour \n\nand their general high abundance and characteristics arrangements in clusters and \n\nalignments (Suess et al., 1998). \n\nChemosynthetic endosymbioses occur ubiquitously at oxic-anoxic interfaces in \n\nmarine environments. In these mutualisms, bacteria living directly within the cell of a \n\neukaryotic host oxidize reduced chemicals (sulphur or methane), fuelling their own \n\nenergetic and biosynthetic needs, in addition to those of their host (Stewart et al., 2005). \n\nThe oldest metazoans populated with microbes in vent settings are Silurian in age, as the \n\nmetazoan fossils of seep deposits (Campbell, 2006). \n\nThe nutrition of the Vesicomidae clams and solemyids is based on the thiotrophic \n\nchemoautotrophy of the endosymbionts. Vestimentiferans and pogonophorams are also \n\nchemoautotrophic, with most species being thiotrophic, but some clear methanotrophic \n\n(Suess et al., 1998). Stable isotopic compositions of tissues (?13C, ?15N, ?34S) are used as \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 49\n\nindicators of the food source. Large depletions of ?13C (-30 to -70\u2030) in the tissues of \n\norganisms, such as vestimentiferans, bivalves and gastropods, have been proposed to \n\nindicate methanotrophy or sulphide oxidation by symbionts in seep and vent taxa (Levin, \n\n2005). The carbon isotopic composition of soft tissues and chitinous hard parts of seep \n\nbiota exhibit 13C-depleted stable isotopic compositions, reflecting thiotrophic and \n\nmethanotrophic origin as the dominant carbon metabolizing pathway. For instance, the \n\n?13C values of non calcareous parts of seep fauna from the Aleutian subduction zone range \n\nfrom -28.6\u2030 to -64.3\u2030 Pee Dee belemnite (PDB) (Suess et al., 1998) and the \n\nchemosynthetic communities from the Florida Escarpment have ?13C values as low as -\n\n76.4\u2030 (Paull et al., 1992). The carbonate shells also exhibit evidence for \n\nchemoautotrophic derived carbon. Usually the seep bivalve shells are only slightly \n\ndepleted in ?13C because they preferably incorporate bicarbonate from seawater. The \n\nvesicomyid clams usually show complex cross-laminar layer structure with differential \n\n?13C compositions that due to metabolic factor are more enriched in the inner lamellas. The \n\nsolemyid shells in general present isotopically lighter carbonate than the carbonate of the \n\nvesicomyid clam shells. This is interpreted as consequence of the solemyids metabolism as \n\nthey utilize a mixture of metabolic and bottom water CO2 in building their shells, probably \n\nbecause they live buried in the vent sediments and pump bottom water through their \n\nborrows (Suess et al., 1998). \n\n \nFigure 2.13.

Geodynamic and oceanographic settings of the Gulf \nof Cadiz \n\n \n\n \n\n3.1 Plate tectonic setting \n\n \n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz is located between the southern limit of the Iberia continental \n\nmargin and the northern limit of the Africa Atlantic margin. The regional geodynamic \n\nsetting in the Gulf of Cadiz is dominated by the slow convergence of about 4 mm/year \n\nbetween the African and the Eurasian plates (Argus et al., 1989). \n\nThe boundary between the Eurasia and the Africa tectonic plates (Figure 3.1) extends \n\nfrom the Azores archipelago, in the West, across the Gibraltar area in the Gulf of Cadiz, \n\nand to the East through the Alboran Sea, into the Mediterranean region in the north of \n\nMorocco, Algeria and Tunisia (Buforn et al., 1995). This plate boundary has a complex \n\nnature due to its proximity to the pole of rotation of the African plate (Buforn et al., 2004a; \n\nBuforn et al., 2004b). The Atlantic sector of the Azores-Gibraltar Plate Boundary (AGPB) \n\nhas a variable stress pattern along its length. In the western sector, from the Mid-Atlantic \n\nRidge until 25\u00baW, the Azores plateau (Figure 3.1), it is characterized by a divergent \n\nbehaviour with crustal extension and normal faulting (Jim\u00e9nez-Munt et al., 2001). In the \n\ncentral sector, the Gloria fault, between 25\u00ba and 15\u00baW, the boundary has a transcurrent \n\nmotion with dextral strike-slip faulting (Jim\u00e9nez-Munt et al., 2001). The eastern sector, \n\ndelimited from the Gloria Fault by the Tore-Madeira Ridge, is composed of two distinct \n\nregions: the Gorringe Bank region, that has oceanic affinities (Sartori et al., 1994); and the \n\nGulf of Cadiz region, more likely of continental nature. Both regions of this AGPL sector \n\nare characterised by a general NW-directed compressive behaviour with plate convergence \n\nand reverse faulting (Tortella et al., 1997) with a transpressional regime in the Gulf of \n\nCadiz. This sector of the AGPL is more complex than the ones to the west and neither the \n\nplate limits nor the lithosphere structure are yet well constrained (Sartori et al., 1994). \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 3.

Plate boundary adapted \n\nfrom Coffin et al. (2000) and relative movements from Jim\u00e9nez-Munt et al. (2001). The Gulf of Cadiz \n\nlocation is shown by the letters: GC. \n\n \n\nThe main regional features in the Gulf of Cadiz are related with the Rif-Betic \n\nmountain belt, with westward directed thrusting (Maldonado et al., 1999), that establishes \n\nthe eastern limit of the Azores-Gibraltar transform. The arcuate mountain belt of the Rif-\n\nBetic surrounds a zone of strong Neogene subsidence and crustal thinning in the Western \n\nAlboran Sea. \n\nIn the Gulf of Cadiz, the Eurasia-Africa boundary or, more precisely, the Iberia-\n\nAfrica (Nubia) boundary, corresponds to a NNW-SSE directed continental-continental \n\ncollisional setting, with a slow convergence of 2 to 4 mm/year (Argus et al., 1989; Sartori \n\net al., 1994), and with a diffuse nature (Jim\u00e9nez-Munt et al., 2001). The deformation is \n\nexpressed by a large number of lithospheric blocks delimited by deep accidents with \n\nvariable main orientations: E-W to ENE-WSW; NW-SE; and NE-SW (Cabral, 1995). The \n\ncomplex interaction of these microplates is expressed by a diffuse seismicity in the Gulf of \n\nCadiz and Gibraltar region (Jim\u00e9nez-Munt et al., 2001) with superficial epicentres and \n\nwith important intermediate-depth epicentres (Figure 3.4). The focal mechanisms indicate \n\nGC \n\n\n\n \n\nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 53\n\npredominantly inverse fault systems and oblique NW-SE convergence (Grimison and \n\nChen, 1986; Buforn et al., 1995).  \n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz area comprises the ocean-continent boundaries of the African and \n\nIberian plates. The exact location of the continental-ocean boundary is not exactly known \n\nbut it is accepted that most of the Gulf of Cadiz basement is continental crust that thins to \n\nthe west and oceanic crust is probably found at the Gorringe Bank, Horseshoe and Seine \n\nAbyssal Plains (Gonzalez-Fernandez et al., 2001).  \n\nSeveral tectonic models have been proposed to explain the different geologic \n\ncharacteristics of the Gulf of Cadiz. Subduction models involving either: a southward-dip \n\n(Sanz de Galdeano, 1990; Morales et al., 1999), a northward-dip (Torres-Roldan et al., \n\n1986), an eastward-dip (Royden, 1993; Lonergan and White, 1997; Gutscher et al., 2002; \n\nGutscher et al., 2006; Thiebot and Gutscher, 2006), and a westward-dip (Docherty and \n\nBanda, 1995) have been proposed. Maldonado et al. (1999) propose the subduction of \n\nintermediate-type crust from the Iberian margin under the Alboran microplate in a western \n\nAlboran subduction zone with subsequent deformation of the lower plate in the form of \n\ncrustal slices. Alternatively, Sartori et al. (1994) proposed that the tectonic stress from the \n\nIberia-Africa convergence was released across a 200 km long area between the Seine \n\nAbyssal plain and the Gorringe Bank, without a defined plate margin and without any \n\nsubduction been developed in the area. \n\nWhile both tectonic regimes: subduction and distributed compression deformation, \n\nhave not been demonstrated and strong debate is still going on, the Gutscher et al. (2002) \n\n(active) subduction model proposes the Gulf of Cadiz as an (active) accretionary wedge \n\nresulting from the east dipping subduction zone beneath the Gibraltar Arc and the Alboran \n\ndomain. This subduction would be the result of slab rollback towards the west causing \n\nextension and subsidence in the Alboran domain and westward advance of the Gibraltar \n\nArc resulting in compressional deformation of the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary wedge. This \n\nmodel is based on the tomography data that images a slab of cold and dense material, \n\ninterpreted as oceanic lithosphere, dipping from the Atlantic domain of the Gulf of Cadiz, \n\npassing through intermediate depths (60-120 km) beneath the westernmost Alboran Sea \n\n(region dominated by intermediate depth seismicity) and that is proposed to merge with a \n\nregion of deep-focus earthquakes (600-660 km) below Granada, Spain (Figure 3.2). The \n\nobservation of active thrust faults dipping to the east, above an east dipping decollement \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 3. Geodynamic and oceanographic settings of the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 54 \n\nand an eastern dipping basement (Figure 3.3) is interpreted as indicating an active \n\naccretionary wedge in the Gulf of Cadiz region supporting the tectonic model of Gutscher \n\n(2002). \n\n \nFigure 3.2.

The main characteristic of the distribution of the epicentres in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\nis the asymmetry between the North and South margins. The seismicity is clearly \n\nconcentrated in the Iberia margin (between the latitude 36\u00ba and 37\u00baN) while along the \n\nMoroccan margin the seismicity is found on the Rif, including the Larache area, but out of \n\nthis domain the seismicity is very scarce (Figure 3.4). This indicates that the deformation \n\ncaused by the present day active collision between Africa (Nubia) and Iberia is being \n\nconcentrated on the northern sector of the Gulf of Cadiz where most probably the plate \n\nboundary is located. \n\n \nFigure 3.4. Distribution of the epicentres between 1963 and 2006 (magnitude > 0.1) taken from the USGE-\n\nANSS catalogue. Shallow earthquakes (depth &lt;20 km) are represented in blue, intermediate earthquakes (20 \n\n&lt;depth &lt;40 km) are represented in green and deep earthquakes (depth > 40 km) are represented in red. The \n\nsize of the points is proportional to the magnitude of the earthquake according to the scale. \n\n \n\nIn the area of the Gulf of Cadiz the distribution of the epicentres shows a complex \n\nbehaviour, with shallow (depth &lt;20 km) earthquakes showing a diffuse distribution but \n\nwhere some clusters can be identified. These clusters seem to correlate with main \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 3. Geodynamic and oceanographic settings of the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 56 \n\ntopographic and structural highs, such as the Gorringe Bank with a NE-SW orientation, the \n\nGuadalquivir Bank, where the epicentres are scattered but the general orientation NE-SW \n\nis still possible to be identified; clusters of the epicentres are also found located along some \n\nfaults as the Horseshoe fault also with the NE-SW trend (Figure 3.4). The distribution of \n\nthe intermediate depth (between 20 and 40 km) and the deep epicentres show a similar \n\npattern (V\u00e1zquez et al., 2000; V\u00e1zquez et al., 2003). The location of the epicentres in this \n\nlocation are in agreement with the main tectonic trend described for this area (Torelli et al., \n\n1997; Hayward et al., 1999; Maldonado et al., 1999). The seismicity also shows \n\nconspicuous evidences of particular lineaments with a NW-SE direction or with the NE-\n\nSW direction (Figure 3.4). Some of those lineaments on the seismicity can be correlated \n\nwith tectonic lineaments that correspond to the limits and the direction of some of the \n\nchannels and ridges recognised on the bathymetry and on the side-scan sonar imagery. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3 Geodynamic evolution of the study area \n\n \n\nThe geodynamic evolution of the Gulf of Cadiz involved multiphase extensional and \n\ncompressional episodes, the last of which is related with the development of the Gibraltar \n\nArc associated with the termination of the Betic-Rif orogen, in the W sector of the \n\nMediterranean Alpine belt (Roberts, 1970). \n\n3.3.1 Mesozoic \n\nDuring the Mesozoic, from the Permo-Triassic, the geodynamic evolution of the \n\nSouth Iberia margin, as a passive margin, was related with a generalized period of \n\nextension, related with the break-up of the Pangaea and the opening of the central and \n\nnorth Atlantic ocean. During the Triassic and Jurassic pre-rift and rift phases, a regional \n\noblique extension and rifting, with sinistral strike-slip motion characterized the South \n\nIberia margin (Garc\u00eda-Due\u00f1as et al., 1994; Tortella et al., 1997). As result of this extensive \n\nphase, during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous (see Figure 3.5A) this area acted as a \n\ncontinental passive margin (Mauffret et al., 1989). During the Late Cretaceous the area \n\nstart to change to a compressive setting associated with the convergence of Iberia with \n\nAfrica  (Rosenbaum et al., 2002). \n\n\n\n \n\nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 57\n\n3.3.2 Cenozoic \n\nDuring the Cenozoic the South Iberia margin was in a compressive setting with N-S \n\nconvergence resultant from the rotation of Africa (Srivastava et al., 1990). From this phase \n\nresulted subduction processes with the closure of the Tethys, subsequent continental \n\ncollision and litospheric deformation started to develop (Rosenbaum et al., 2002). At the \n\nmeridional Iberia Margin, this process resulted in the formation of the Rif-Betics orogenia \n\nbelt, that defines the western domain of the Alpine orogen (Roberts, 1970).  \n\n3.3.2.1 Paleogene \n\nDuring the Late Cretaceous to the Middle Eocene, Iberia and Africa behave as a solid \n\nplate. During the Late Eocene and Early Oligocene, Iberia became again independent from \n\nthe Africa plate and at the beginning of the Oligocene the area south Iberia margin goes \n\nthrough a new compressive phase as result of the Euroasiatic-Africa plates convergence \n\n(Srivastava et al., 1990), as illustrated in Figure 3.6A-B. At this time the boundary of the \n\ntwo plates is defined by the Azores-Gibraltar Fracture Zone with characteristics very \n\nsimilar to the present day. \n\n3.3.2.2 Neogene \n\nDuring the Neogene three different phases can be defined in the geodynamic \n\nevolution of the Gulf of Cadiz. The first phase corresponds to the last phase of the Rif-\n\nBetic orogen during the Early and Middle Miocene. The second phase, in the Late Miocene \n\nand Pliocene, is characterized by subsidence and extensional regime in the area, with the \n\nformation of normal faults with a NNE-SSW direction. The last phase, in the Quaternary is \n\ncharacterized by an inversion of the tectonic regime that became compressive. \n\n3.3.2.2.1 Early and Middle Miocene \n\nDuring the Early Miocene the area goes under a compressive regime with the \n\nbeginning of the formation of the Betic orogen (Figure 3.5B and Figure 3.6B). The Iberia-\n\nAfrica compression is along a NNW-SSE direction (Srivastava et al., 1990). This \n\ncompressive regime resulted in a convergence of more than 200 km in an N-S direction \n\nsince the Oligocene to the Late Miocene, resulting in the complete closure of the Tethys \n\nand the displacement of the Gibraltar Arc to the West (Dewey et al., 1989), and the \n\ndevelopment of the Alboran micro-plate to the East (Figure 3.6B-H). \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 3. Geodynamic and oceanographic settings of the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 58 \n\nAs result of this westward migration of the Gibraltar arc front, the instability of the \n\ncontinental shelf was promoted and the emplacement of chaotic bodies occurred during the \n\nMiocene, the so called olistostrome, (Tortella et al., 1997). The emplacement of the chaotic \n\nbodies was also promoted by the development, during his emplacement, of trusts in its \n\nfront and extensional structures in its back, as a result of fast subsidence in the basin \n\n(Maldonado and Nelson, 1999). \n\n \nFigure 3.5.

The \n\npresent shorelines of southern Europe and Africa are outlined for reference. AGFZ: Azores-Gibraltar \n\nFracture Zone. \n\n \n\n3.3.2.2.2 Late Miocene and Pliocene \n\nDuring the Early and Middle Miocene the connection between the Atlantic and the \n\nAlboran domain (Figure 3.6C-F) was established through the Guadalquivir basin north of \n\nthe Betic range and through the Guercif, South of the Rif (Mulder and Parry, 1977). The \n\nmigration to the West of the Alboran domain resulted in the closure of these connections \n\nthat can be associated with a period of low sealevel stand and resulted in the closure of the \n\nconnection of the Mediterranean Sea with the Atlantic (Haq et al., 1987), leading to the \n\ndesiccation of the Mediterranean, between 5.96 and 5.33 Ma (Figure 3.6H): the so-called \n\nMessinian salinity crisis (Krijgsman et al., 1999). \n\nDuring the Early Pliocene, the tectonic regime became transtensional resulting in \n\nlocal extension in the area, and leading to the opening of the Gibraltar strait, re-establishing \n\nthe connection between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean (Figure 3.7A). \n\n\n\n \n\nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 59\n\n \nFigure 3.6.

These domains \n\ninclude, from the Gibraltar strait towards the abyssal plains: the Flysh domain, the Sub-\n\nBetics, the Cadiz Basin, the alocthonous units, and the accretionary wedge (Figure 3.8). \n\n3.4.1 Flysch domain \n\nThe Flysh domain occurs both on land and offshore and corresponds to the SE sector \n\nof the Iberia margin and the NW sector of the Moroccan margin (Figure 3.8) located close \n\nto and in the Strait of Gibraltar. It is composed of siliciclastic deposits, mostly turbidites of \n\nCretaceous to Miocene age, indicating deep deposition in a trough located between the \n\nIberian margin and the Alboran domain, later translated and incorporated into the Gibraltar \n\nArc. This domain is delimited to the W by a major thrust with an arcuate shape, indicating \n\ndisplacement to the NW and overthrusting of the sub-Betic domain (Puga, 2004). This \n\nthrust can be mapped offshore and onshore in southern Spain and in northern Morocco. \n\n \n\n3.4.2 Sub-Betic domain \n\nThe sub-Betic domain is located externally around the Flysch domain. Its front is \n\ndelimited by a major thrust that defines the arcuate shape of this domain. It corresponds to \n\nthe external domain of the Rif-Betics orogen. This domain consists of Triassic to lower \n\nMiocene deposits that represents the south Iberian Mesozoic paleo-margin, later \n\nincorporated into the Rif-Betic orogen. \n\n3.4.3 Cadiz Basin \n\nThis domain is located in front and externally to the sub-Betic domain. This domain \n\nis characterized by the infilling of the depocenters along the NE-SW direction of the trusts \n\nfrom the sub-Betic domain. This domain is filled by deposits of the Neogene, \n\ncorresponding to the infilling by sediments from the main emerged areas. The Cadiz basin \n\ndeveloped during the Early Miocene and the oldest deposits are deformed and overlain by \n\nthe emplacement of the Alloctonous Unit of the Guadalquivir (Puga, 2004) marking \n\ntherefore the age of the emplacement of the first allochthonous units. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 3. Geodynamic and oceanographic settings of the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 62 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.8. Different geologic domains in the Gulf of Cadiz as defined by Somoza et al. (1999) and \n\nMedialdea et al. (2004). (A) map modified from Medialdea et al. (2004) and from Hensen et al. (in press). \n\n(B-C) cross sections long the Gulf of Cadiz (Medialdea et al., 2004).

The NE limit \n\nis subdivided by three main diapiric ridges that subdivide the basin into several sub-basins \n\nlocated between the diapiric ridges. In general the direction of these basins coincides with \n\nthe direction of the main Cadiz basin. \n\nOn the seismic profiles, these basins have up to 1.7 s (TWT) in thicknesses, an \n\nasymmetric geometry and the have been deformed by the diapiric emplacements during the \n\nPliocene and the Quaternary. \n\n3.4.4 Allochthonous units (Olistostrome/Accretionary wedge) \n\nThe allochthonous deposits in the Gulf of Cadiz (the so-called Olistostrome, chaotic \n\nbody, Guadalquivir allochthon, Guadalquivir accretionary wedge or melange of the Gulf of \n\nCadiz), recognized onland and offshore (Roberts, 1970), have been interpreted as resulting \n\nfrom gravitational processes, debris-flow mechanisms, diapirism and tectonic melanges. \n\nMedialdea et al. (2004) defined three different domains of the allochhnous units, based on \n\ntheir seismic architecture, the main tectonic features and the nature of the basement \n\n(oceanic or continental), corresponding to different evolutionary steps in the mechanisms \n\nof emplacement of the allochthonous units. \n\nThe eastern domain extends along the continental shelf and upper and middle slope \n\nand corresponds to the offshore extension of the Betic\u2013Rifean external front. This domain \n\nwas emplaced as part of the pre-Messinian orogenic wedge related to the collision that \n\ngave rise to the Betic\u2013Rifean belt by a combined gravitational and tectonic mechanism. It \n\nis characterized by salt and shale nappes later affected by extensional collapses. \n\nThe central domain develops along the lower slope between the Betic\u2013Rifean front \n\nand the abyssal plains and is characterized by a change in dip of the allochthonous basal \n\nsurface and the basement. The northern boundary of this domain is marked by the \n\noccurrence of a major WNW\u2013ESE-trending thrust fault with a strike-slip component, \n\nknown as the Gorringe\u2013Horseshoe fault (Medialdea et al., 2004). \n\nThe westernmost domain corresponds to the abyssal plains, where the distal \n\nemplacement of the allochthonous body takes place; it is characterized by thrust faults \n\naffecting both the sedimentary cover and the possible oceanic basement. The allochthonous \n\nunits of the central and western domains were emplaced after the emplacement of the \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 3. Geodynamic and oceanographic settings of the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 64 \n\neastern domain, as a consequence of the Iberia-Africa NE\u2013SW compression since the Late \n\nMiocene until present. \n\n3.4.5 Plio-Quaternary morpho-sedimentary domains \n\nSince the Late Pliocene until present the tectonic setting in the Gulf of Cadiz became \n\nmainly transpressive with the main compression in the NNW-SSE direction (Maldonado et \n\nal., 1999). The Quaternary sediment cover of the Gulf of Cadiz was conditioned by the \n\nsealevel fluctuations with the deposition of thick terrigenous deposits originated from the \n\nGuadalquivir and Guadiana rivers which on the continental shelf form progradant wedges \n\ntoward the shelf edge. The northern margin of the Gulf of Cadiz is characterized by an \n\nactive compressive framework where the allochthonous units provide an unstable basement \n\nfor Late Miocene, Pliocene and Quaternary sedimentation. The Quaternary sedimentation \n\nin the Gulf of Cadiz is a combination of a contourite-turbidite system with combined drift-\n\nfan morphologies. The presence of a high density of canyons (St. Vicente, Aljesur, Lagos, \n\nPortim\u00e3o and Faro Canyons and the Guadalquivir and Cadiz Channels) in the western part \n\nof the South Portuguese margin that drain sediment directly to the Horseshoe Abyssal \n\nPlain resulted in the turbiditic sedimentation of the Abyssal plain with slump debris flow \n\ndeposits along this part of the margin. The middle slope is dominated by along-slope \n\nprocesses driven by the Mediterranean Outflow water (MO) that during the Pliocene and \n\nthe Quaternary produced the edification of a complex contourite depositional system \n\n(Mougenot and Vanney, 1982; Faug\u00e8res et al., 1984; Nelson et al., 1993; Hernandez-\n\nMolina et al., 2003). This contourite system is composed of both depositional and erosive \n\nfeatures (Figure 3.9). The main depositional features are composed of sedimentary wave \n\nfields, sedimentary lobes, mixed drifts, plastered drifts, elongated mounded, separated \n\ndrifts and sheeted drifts. The main erosive features of the contourite system are the \n\ncontourite channels, furrows, marginal valleys and moats (Llave et al., 2001; Hernandez-\n\nMolina et al., 2003; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2006; Llave et al., 2006). The development \n\nof this contourite system is controlled by the Pliocene and Quaternary environmental and \n\npaleoceanographic changes and by the morphology of the margin. The lower slope with an \n\nirregular morphology and the Abyssal plains are dominated by down-slope depositional \n\nprocesses. A present day morphosedimentary characterization of the Gulf of Cadiz is \n\npresented in Figure 3.9. \n\n\n\n \n\nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 65\n\n \nFigure 3.9.

Morphosedimentary sectors: (1) proximal scour and sand ribbons \n\nsector; (2) overflow sedimentary lobe sector; (3) channels and ridges sector; (4) contourite depositional \n\nsector; and (5) submarine canyon sector. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.5 Oceanographic setting and the Mediterranean Outflow \n\n \n\n3.5.1 Present day oceanographic setting \n\nThe present day circulation patterns and the hydrographical conditions in the Gulf of \n\nCadiz are dominated by the exchange of water masses through the Strait of Gibraltar. The \n\nAtlantic Ocean at the latitude of the Gulf of Cadiz and off Iberia is characterized by four \n\nmain water masses: \n\n(~100-600 m depth) The Eastern North Atlantic Central Water (Fiuza, 1984) is \n\nrepresented by the descending branch of the Gulf Stream. \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 3. Geodynamic and oceanographic settings of the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 66 \n\n(~600 to 1400 m depth) The Mediterranean Water (MW) that corresponds to the \n\nWestern Mediterranean Intermediate and Bottom Waters characterized by high salinity, \n\nrelatively high temperature and reduced concentration of dissolved oxygen.  \n\n(2000 to 4000 m) The North Atlantic Deep Water \n\n(>4000 m) The Antarctic Bottom Water \n\nA regional subdivision of these water masses into four layers can be established and \n\nto each of these layers corresponds a particular transport direction. \n\nIn the ocean surface, two sub-layers can be defined: the mixture layer or the \n\nthermocline layer, which is the superficial layer (0-100 m), under direct influence of the \n\natmosphere dynamics and that shows considerable seasonal variability. Above the \n\nthermocline layer that corresponds to the Eastern North Atlantic Water (Fiuza, 1984). \n\nBellow the Eastern North Atlantic Water is located under the Eastern North Atlantic \n\nCentral Water (ENACW) and presents in the eastern sector of the North Atlantic two main \n\ncomponents (Figure 3.10), with distinctive origins, that split at a latitude of about 40\u00baN \n\n(Fiuza, 1984). A water mass with a setenptrional subpolar source, the Eastern North \n\nAtlantic Central Water subpolar (ENACWp), formed by cold convection of deep water at \n\nthe north and northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. The second component of the ENACW \n\nhas a subtropical origin and is therefore called the Eastern North Atlantic Central Water \n\nsubtropical (ENACWt). The ENACWt is the central water at the SW and S Portuguese \n\nmargins, in the Gulf of Cadiz and in the Atlantic Moroccan margin. In the Gulf of Cadiz, \n\nthis segment of the ENACWt is characterized by temperature values that range from 8 to \n\n18\u00baC and salinities between 32.2 and 36.7 (Emery and Meincke, 1986). The ENACWt is \n\ndescribed as moving at intermediate depths under the Azores current and circulates in the \n\nGulf of Cadiz between 100 and 850 m (Fiuza, 1984; Fiuza et al., 1998) but its velocity is \n\nconsidered to be significant only bellow depths of about 500 m, under the surface layer \n\ncharacterized by a strong seasonal variation (Fiuza, 1984). \n\nThe hydrology, morphology and the sedimentary dynamics of the Gulf of Cadiz are \n\nintensely modulated by the intermediate water mass of the Mediterranean Water (MW). \n\nThe MW is characterized by temperatures of about 13\u00baC, high salinities (~36.5), and an \n\noxygen content of about 176 \u00b5mol kg-1 (Madelain, 1970; Ambar and Howe, 1979a; Ambar \n\net al., 2002). The MW that outflows into the Gulf of Cadiz is composed mainly (about \n\n\n\n \n\nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 67\n\n90%) by the Levantine Intermediate Water and by the Western Mediterranean Deep Water \n\n(Bryden and Stommel, 1984). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.10.

ENACWp: subpolar branch of the Eastern North \n\nAtlantic Central Water; ENACWt: subtropical branch of the Eastern North Atlantic Central Water. \n\n \n\nIn the Strait of Gibraltar a two-layer circulation system is established, where the less \n\nsaline water from the Atlantic enters into the Mediterranean as an upper layer and the more \n\nsaline Mediterranean water outflows from the Mediterranean into the Atlantic as a bottom \n\nlayer. The Atlantic Influx corresponds to water from the ENACWt that crosses the Strait of \n\nGibraltar at the surface while the MW crosses the Strait beneath the Atlantic Influx at \n\nENACWp\nNAC\n\nENACWt\n\nAC \nSTF \n\nNAC: North Atlantic Current \n\nAC: Azores current \n\nSTF: Subtropical Front \n\nF: Subsurface front \n\n(ENACWp-ENACWt) \n\n(Fraga et al., 1982) \n\nKS: Frontal Band \n\n(Kase &amp; Siedler, 1982) \n\nF \n\nK\n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 3. Geodynamic and oceanographic settings of the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 68 \n\ndepths of 40 to 200 m, depending on the bottom strait topography (Gascard and Richez, \n\n1985). After passing the Strait, the Mediterranean Outflow (MO) descends into the Gulf of \n\nCadiz as a density current, forming a turbulent flux 150 to 200 m wide and moves in \n\ncontact with the seafloor along a channel within the Gibraltar gateway in a WSW direction, \n\nat a speed of more than 200 cm/s (Ambar and Howe, 1979a), locally reaching 300 cm/s \n\n(Mulder et al., 2003). The MO velocity is strongly affected by the bottom topography and \n\nit decreases as result of the friction with the seafloor and as the mixing with the ENACW \n\ndiminishes the MW density anomaly. Most probably, this flux influences the site where \n\nmethane-derived authigenic carbonates (MDAC) were identified and sampled in front of \n\nthe Gibraltar Strait, and in which strong bottom currents were evident on the underwater \n\nvideo profiles (see description in section 4.4.3.3, of Chapter 4). Thereafter, the MO spreads \n\nwestward into the Gulf of Cadiz and due to the Coriolis effect the MO is deflected to the \n\nright of its pathway, i.e. along the slope, rather than directly to the west. There it flows \n\nagainst the upper slope of the South Iberian margin, in a NW direction, along the MO \n\nChannel (Figure 3.11) where it flows as a strong bottom current and where the friction with \n\nthe seabottom is an important process controlling the MO behaviour (Baringer and Price, \n\n1999). Due to horizontal variations of the outflow properties and as the upper and middle \n\nslope is characterized by a complex bottom topography with several canyons, plateau and \n\nmounds that steer the MO, these factors favour the splitting of the plume into several veins \n\n(Madelain, 1970; Zenk and Armi, 1990) and flows are distributed at constant depths along \n\nthe Cadiz channel and Guadalquivir channel. Divergences of the MO from the main \n\ncurrent direction, that flow down-slope are also observed such as the one that flows along \n\nthe Gil Eanes channel (Figure 3.11). On its pathway, the MW gradually decreases its high \n\nthermohaline properties with the correspondent decrease in density, as it mixes with the \n\nsurrounding fresher and colder ENACWt (Price et al., 1993; Price and Baringer, 1994). \n\nUntil approximately the longitude of 8\u00baW, the MO behaves as a density current and from \n\nhere it changes into a wall-bounded jet. Downstream from this area the MW reaches a \n\ndensity equilibrium with the surrounding ENACWt and the MO flows at mid-depths \n\n(Ambar et al., 1999). \n\nAs the MO changes the direction from a westward direction to a north-westward \n\ndirection (Figure 3.11) due to the Coriolis effect, it is divided into two main cores: the \n\n\n\n \n\nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 69\n\nMediterranean Upper core - MU and the Mediterranean Lower core \u2013 ML (Madelain, \n\n1970; Ambar and Howe, 1979b; Gardner and Kidd, 1983; Zenk and Armi, 1990). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.11. General circulation pattern of the Mediterranean Outflow water (MO) in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n(Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2006). \n\n \n\nThe MU upper core corresponds to the less dense core and is located between 500 \n\nand 800 m depth and is characterized by a density of 27.6 (?0). Until Cape St. Vicente it is \n\ncharacterized by an average velocity of 46 cm/s, a mean temperature of 13.4\u00baC and salinity \n\nof 37.07 (Ambar et al., 1999).  \n\nThe ML is denser than the MU and corresponds to the main water flux of the MO in \n\nthe Gulf of Cadiz. It is centred at about 1200 m depth and is characterized by a density of \n\n27.8 (?0). Between 6\u00ba20\u2019W and 7\u00baW (Figure 3.11), the ML is divided into three minor \n\nbranches that flow along different channels (Madelain, 1970; Nelson et al., 1993; Garc\u00eda et \n\nal., 2003): the intermediate branch (IB), which flows north-westward along the Diogo C\u00e3o \n\nchannel; the principal branch (PB), which is, at present, responsible for the main transport \n\nof the MO and flows south of the Guadalquivir Bank along the Guadalquivir channel; and \n\nthe southern branch (SB), that flows along several steep valleys with an important flow \n\nalong the Cadiz channel. \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 3. Geodynamic and oceanographic settings of the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 70 \n\nA third core of the MW, not so conspicuous, with a shallower depth between 400 and \n\n600 m depth, was identified in the southern (Ambar, 1983) and western (Ambar, 1983; \n\nHinrichsen et al., 1993) Portuguese coast, not extending further offshore than about 50 km. \n\nMapping the thermohaline field and the sedimentary structures in the Northern \n\nmargin of the Gulf of Cadiz have shown that the MO in general flows at the seabottom and \n\nhas a strong erosional effect on the seafloor, especially to the East of Portim\u00e3o Canyon (E \n\nof 8\u00ba30\u2019W). It is proposed as a reference that the MO becomes neutrally buoyant and \n\nlooses contact with the seafloor at 1000 m depth in the easternmost area and at 1400 m \n\ndepth in the westernmost area (Baringer and Price, 1999). To the west of the Portim\u00e3o \n\ncanyon the margin becomes dominated by submarine valleys and canyons that strongly \n\ninfluence the MO current causing stronger instability (Ch\u00e9rubin et al., 2003), diverging \n\nand inducing the meandering of the MO, producing their offshore extension (Ambar and \n\nHowe, 1979a, b; Zenk and Armi, 1990) and giving origin to vortices or eddies of MW, the \n\nso-called meddies (Serra et al., 2005). Meddies generation is also promoted at the St. \n\nVicente Promontory and Cape (Serra et al., 2005). The spreading of the MO is reinforced \n\nby the development of these meddies that detach from the Mediterranean undercurrent \n\nmass (Figure 3.12). The meddies play an important role in the dispersion of the \n\nMediterranean water into the Atlantic (Armi and Zenk, 1984; Armi et al., 1989; \n\nRichardson et al., 1989; Serra et al., 2005) but also in the transport of particulate and \n\ndissolved matter (Freitas and Abrantes, 2002). \n\nUnderneath the Mediterranean Water flows the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). \n\nIn the Gulf of Cadiz the NADW flows southward, bellow 2000 m water depth. The \n\nNADW is a multiple-source water mass, characterized by a low stratification and with \n\ntemperatures ranging from 4-8\u00baC, salinity values between 24.95 and 35.2 and a with high \n\noxygen content (Emery and Meincke, 1986). \n\nThe bottom water mass in the eastern Atlantic basin is the Antarctic Bottom Water \n\n(ABW) that circulates under the NADW at depths greater than 4000 m (Emery and \n\nMeincke, 1986) and that therefore does not have direct influence in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\naccretionary wedge region. \n\n\n\n \n\nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 71\n\n \nFigure 3.12. General circulation pattern of the Mediterranean Outflow water (MO) in the eastern North \n\nAtlantic (Iorga and Lozier, 1999). \n\n \n\n \n\n3.5.2 Brief overview of the paleoceanographic evolution of the MO \n\nThe MO started with the opening of the Strait of Gibraltar at the end of the Miocene \n\n(Maldonado et al., 1999) but a similar to the present day oceanographic configuration was \n\nestablished after the global cooling event in the Late Pliocene at 2.4 Ma (Loubere, 1987; \n\nThunell et al., 1991). This cooling event triggered a shift to more arid conditions and \n\nestablished a negative water balance in the Mediterranean and an anti-estuarine water \n\nexchange between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. Since 2.4 Ma the MO has \n\nundergone significant variations as the result of the climate and sea-level fluctuations \n\n(Nelson et al., 1993; Voelker et al., 2006). \n\nRecent paleoceanographic studies have concluded that global climate and \n\noceanographic changes have caused vertical and spatial fluctuations of the MO in the Gulf \n\nof Cadiz. An enhancement of the MO occurred during cold periods when compared with \n\nthe warmer periods (Cacho et al., 2000; Llave et al., 2006). It has been proposed that \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 3. Geodynamic and oceanographic settings of the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 72 \n\nduring cool stages and low-stands of glacial sea level, the cross section at the Gibraltar \n\nStrait was reduced and the MO volume was lower than at present day conditions (Gardner \n\nand Kidd, 1983; Matthiesen and Haines, 2003). Such a setting may well have diminished \n\nthe water exchange between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic but, the lower temperature \n\nand the generally dryer Mediterranean would result in a significantly higher salinity and \n\ndensity of the MW (Schonfeld, 1997; Cacho et al., 2000; Schonfeld and Zahn, 2000). This \n\nwould then result in a more intense and deeper-flowing MO i.e. in a enhancement of the \n\nLower core of the MO during cool low-sealevel periods (Thomson et al., 1999; Rogerson \n\net al., 2005; Llave et al., 2006). During the warm periods of high sealevel the density of \n\nthe MO would be lower than during the cold periods, and therefore the interaction of the \n\nupper MO cores would be more intense at shallower water depths (Thomson et al., 1999; \n\nRogerson et al., 2005; Llave et al., 2006). \n\n \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 73\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 4.   Characterization of areas of MDAC occurrence in \nthe Gulf of Cadiz and their relation to other fluid escape \n\nstructures \n\n \n\n \n\n4.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nFluid seepage structures are characterized by housing and sustaining unique \n\nconsortia of benthic organisms (Suess et al., 1985; Olu et al., 1997; Sibuet and Olu, 1998; \n\nLevin, 2005), geochemical and geothermal anomalies in the seafloor sediments (Kastner et \n\nal., 1991; Wallmann et al., 1997; Henry et al., 2002; Henrys et al., 2003; Sassen et al., \n\n2003), formation of massive authigenic carbonates (Kulm et al., 1986; Hovland et al., \n\n1987; Ritger et al., 1987; Hovland and Judd, 1988; Kulm and Suess, 1990; Paull et al., \n\n1992), methane plumes in the ocean column (Roberts and Aharon, 1994; Roberts, 2001; \n\nGreinert et al., 2002; Greinert and Nutzel, 2004; Greinert et al., 2006; Sauter et al., 2006) \n\nand the occurrence of gas hydrates (Shipley and Didyk, 1982; Sassen et al., 2001a; Sassen \n\net al., 2001b; Sassen et al., 2004). The occurrence of fluid escape processes at continental \n\nmargins is now recognized as widespread in a variety of different marine settings and \n\nthroughout the geological record (Campbell et al., 2002; Peckmann and Thiel, 2004). The \n\nnature and composition of the expelled fluids and materials from the fluid escape structures \n\nand mud volcanoes provides fundamental information on the geology and geochemistry of \n\nthe deeper sediments. \n\nFluid escape structures in the Gulf of Cadiz (GC) were first reported in the shelf \n\nbreak and in the upper continental slope of the eastern-central part of the GC in areas \n\ncovered by muddy sediments (Baraza and Ercilla, 1996; Baraza et al., 1999). In the last 6 \n\nyears extensive work was carried out by several research groups with the objective to study \n\nthe fluid escape structures and processes in the GC, specially within the middle and lower \n\nslope (Kenyon et al., 2000; Gardner, 2001; Kenyon et al., 2001, 2002; Somoza et al., \n\n\n\nChapter 4. Characterization of areas of MDAC occurrence in the Gulf of Cadiz and their relation to \nother fluid escape structures \n\n 74 \n\n2002; Van Rooij et al., 2002; D\u00edaz-del-R\u00edo et al., 2003; Kenyon et al., 2003; Pinheiro et \n\nal., 2003; Somoza et al., 2003; Kopf et al., 2004; Depreiter et al., 2005; Henriet et al., \n\n2005; Rensbergen et al., 2005a; Rensbergen et al., 2005b; Rooij et al., 2005; Kenyon et \n\nal., 2006; Masson and Berndt, 2006). As a result, 41 mud volcanoes (confirmed by coring), \n\nwith gas hydrates being recovered from 3 of them, as well as many other fluid escape \n\nfeatures, were described and studied. Figure 4.1 illustrates the location of the mud \n\nvolcanoes, mud cones and the occurrences of MDAC in the Gulf of Cadiz. \n\n \nFigure 4.1. Location of the mud volcanoes and MDAC occurrences in the Gulf of Cadiz. Boxes indicate the \n\nmain mud volcano fields defined in previous works and described in the text. \n\n \n\nBased on geophysical data, seafloor video observations and samples collected during \n\nthe TTR10 (Leg 1), TTR11 (Leg 3), TTR12 (Leg 2), TTR14 (Leg 1), TTR15 (Leg 4) and \n\nTTR16 (Leg2) cruises (2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively), \n\ncomplemented with data from the Anastasya 2000, Anastasya 2001 and GAP cruises, \n\nseveral areas have been shown to be characterized by the widespread occurrence of \n\nMDAC: (1) on the Guadalquivir Diapiric Ridge (GDR) and the Formosa Ridge (FR); (2) \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 75\n\nalong several erosional features associated with the Mediterranean outflow (MO) on the \n\nCadiz Channel; (3) on the Pen Duick Escarpment and the Vernadsky Ridge; (4) on some \n\nmud volcanoes and mud diapirs located on the pathway of the MO, Iberico, Faro, \n\nHesperides, Student and Yuma (Kenyon et al., 2002; Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2002; Somoza et \n\nal., 2002; D\u00edaz-del-R\u00edo et al., 2003; Kenyon et al., 2003; Pinheiro et al., 2003; Pinheiro et \n\nal., 2004); (5) dense fields of MDAC were also discovered during the TTR14 cruise on the \n\nmain channel of the MO in front of the Strait of Gibraltar (Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2005; Kenyon \n\net al., 2006); (6) the re-examination of samples collected during an earlier (1976) \n\nHesperides cruise on the northern slope of the Guadalquivir Channel also showed the \n\npresence of similar dolomite chimneys; and (7) MDAC occurring as aragonite and calcite \n\ncrusts and pavements, were also discovered and sampled, associated with the Pen Duick \n\nand the Vernadsky Ridges, within the Cadiz Channel and associated with several mud \n\nvolcanoes: Jesus Baraza, Yuma, Ginsburg, Kid, Mercator, Fiuza, Darwin, Shouen, \n\nAdamastor, Meknes, Hesperides Faro and Porto (Figure 4.1). The present day survey \n\ncoverage shows that fluid escape structures in the GC are far more common features than \n\npreviously anticipated and they now have been found in many locations between 500 and \n\n4000 m water depth. \n\nAs described in Chapter 5, two main lithologic types of MDAC were identified in the \n\ncollected samples from the Gulf of Cadiz: (i) dolomite-dominated carbonates and (ii) \n\naragonite-dominated carbonates. The dolomite-dominated carbonates form crusts, irregular \n\nmassive or nodular aggregates, and chimneys (fluid conduits or filled burrows) with \n\ntubular or pipe-like morphologies. The aragonitic MDAC occur as pavements, crusts or \n\nslabs that pave the seafloor for several square meters, or form buildups and irregular \n\nblocks, up to 2 m high, at the seabottom. \n\nThe geological characteristics of the seafloor at the several fluid escape structures is \n\nhighly variable and is a function of the rate and duration of the seepage episodes as well as \n\nthe nature and composition of the material (solid, fluid and gas) expelled (Roberts, 2001). \n\nIn this Chapter will be presented a synthesis of the different geophysical, visual, \n\ngeochemical and mineralogical data collected from fluid escape structures where MDAC \n\nhave been identified. It is discussed the superficial geology, and to a lesser extent biology, \n\nrelated to the fluid escape structures where MDAC were found. It is also discussed the \n\nrelationship between the seafloor morphology, the seafloor acoustic facies (SSS \n\n\n\nChapter 4. Characterization of areas of MDAC occurrence in the Gulf of Cadiz and their relation to \nother fluid escape structures \n\n 76 \n\nreflectivity) and the nature of the seafloor recognised from underwater video profiles and \n\nfrom the samples retrieved by tv-controlled grab, dredging and gravity coring. A \n\nrelationship between the occurrences of the authigenic carbonates and other fluid escape \n\nstructures, such as mud volcanoes and mud cones, is postulated and the controls of their \n\noccurrence is investigated. Another objective of this chapter is to assess the intensity of the \n\nupward fluid migration, the dynamics and the morphology of the seepage structures and to \n\nrelate them with the different observed seafloor features and products. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2 Methods \n\n4.2.1 Positioning systems \n\nPositioning during the TTR cruises was obtained with an Ashtech GG24 DPS + \n\nGLONASS receiver, allowing an optimal static accuracy of \u00b1 35 cm (75 cm at 95% \n\nconfidence limits). The normal accuracy in the Gulf of Cadiz area, under normal satellite \n\nconfiguration, is assumed to be ca. 5 m. Navigation on board the D. Carlos I (Matespro and \n\nDelila 1 cruises), Sonne, Cornide de Saavedra and Belgica research ships was obtained \n\nusing both Global Positioning System (GPS) and Differential Global Positioning System \n\n(DGPS), installed in one or in multiple positions of the vessel. The two systems were used \n\nin order to obtain the necessary accuracy in position determination, as well as the \n\nnecessary yaw corrections to be used by the multibeam systems. \n\nUnderwater navigation during deep-towed operations onboard the RV Professor \n\nLogachev, such as with deep-towed side-scan sonar (MAK1 and OREtech), the deep-\n\ntowed video system and the TV-controlled grab were based on the Sigma-1001 hydro-\n\nacoustic system. This system consists on a pinger fitted to the deep-towed equipment, \n\noperating between 7-15 kHz, and four stationary hull-mounted acoustic receivers, spaced \n\n14 m apart. The signal emitted by the deep-towed pinger is tracked on board and accurate \n\nx,y position of the device is computed in relation to the vessel, taking into account the \n\nvessel roll, trim and speed. The error of the estimated position of the deep-towed \n\nequipment by this system usually does not exceed 1-2% of the water depth. \n\nDuring the GAP cruise, on board the R/V Sonne, underwater navigation for the \n\nOcean Floor Observation System (OFOS) and of the TV-controlled grab was similar to the \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 77\n\none used onboard the RV Professor Logachev. Given the inferior number of acoustic \n\nreceivers and their closer separation the precision on the underwater determination on \n\nboard the RV Sonne was less accurate than the one achieved with the RV Professor \n\nLogachev. \n\nFor gravity corer seabed sampling, the error in positioning is normally 5% of the \n\naccuracy of the vessel position, due to the rapid deployment. \n\nDetailed descriptions of the positioning systems are presented in Appendix A. \n\n \n\n4.2.2 Seafloor sampling \n\nThe seafloor samples used for this work were collected during several cruises (TTR \n\n09, TTR 10, TTR 11, TTR 12, TTR 14, TTR15, TTR16, Anastasya 2000, Anastasya 2001 \n\nand GAP) using several devices (gravity corer, box corer, multi-corer, Kasten corer, \n\ndredge, grab, and video controlled grab). Sediment sample descriptions from other cruises \n\nwere also used when available and relevant for this study. Detailed descriptions of the \n\nsampling devices are presented in Appendix A. \n\n \n\n4.2.3 Underwater observations \n\nUnderwater observations during the TTR cruises were carried out with an underwater \n\nvideo cameras (analogical or digital), with a video controlled grab (during the TTR and the \n\nGAP cruises) and with the Ocean Floor Observation System (OFOS, GAP cruise). Detailed \n\ndescriptions of these systems are presented in Appendix A. \n\n \n\n4.2.4 Side-scan sonar mapping \n\nSide-scan sonar mapping was performed with the NRL Seamap long range side-scan \n\nsonar, a low frequency 12 KHz system, and with the OKEAN system, which operates at a \n\nfrequency of 9.5 kHz. Both systems have fairly similar resolutions. When no other \n\ncoverage was available and in areas with multibeam coverage, the backscatter imagery \n\nfrom the EM12 swath bathymetry system was used. \n\nHigh resolution deep-towed side-scan sonar imagery (MAK-1M or OREtech) was \n\nalso acquired in areas of detailed investigations. Both MAK and OREtech systems were \n\n\n\nChapter 4. Characterization of areas of MDAC occurrence in the Gulf of Cadiz and their relation to \nother fluid escape structures \n\n 78 \n\nused on board the R/V Professor Logachev during the TTR cruises. They are both \n\nequipped with a subbottom profiler, operating at a frequency of 5 kHz. The maximum \n\nswath coverage is 2 km (1 km per side) for a towing altitude of 150 m above the seafloor, \n\noperating at a frequency of 30 kHz, and about 50 m above the seafloor for 100 kHz \n\nsurveys. The resolution of the system rages from 7 to 1 m across and along the track.  \n\nDetailed descriptions of both systems are given in Appendix A. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3 Results: Geological and geophysical cartography \n\n \n\nBased on the underwater video observations several bottom facies have been defined \n\nand mapped. Whenever possible, these facies were calibrated with sampling information. \n\nThe main bottom facies defined were: \n\n1. Pelagic sediments \n\n2. Rippled pelagic sediments \n\n3. Unrippled pelagic sediments \n\n4. Sediment clogged dead coral framework \n\n5. Live-coral covered sediments \n\n6. Coral rubble, dense coverage of mostly dead coral \n\n7. Paches of mainly dead coral \n\n8. Rock outcrops \n\n9. Mud volcano mud breccia \n\n10. Sediment covered with pogonophora tube worms  \n\n11. Sediment covered with clams and clam fields \n\n12. Bacterial mat \n\n13. MDAC chimney fields: chimneys, pipelike or conduits, corresponding most \n\nprobably to the dolomitic crusts, chimneys and nodules \n\n14. MDAC pavements and buildups: most probably correspond to the aragonitic \n\npavements mineralogies \n\n15. Gas bubbles \n\n16. Gas hydrate patches \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 79\n\nThe underwater video profiles were interpreted and each segment of about 1 minute \n\nwas classified according to the dominant seabottom facies classification defined above. \n\nThe facies classification was then plotted on the navigation and correlated with other \n\nseafloor information as the backscatter intensity and collected samples. \n\nFour main areas or fields of fluid escape structures have been defined for the Gulf of \n\nCadiz (Figure 4.1): (1) the Deep Portuguese Margin Field (DPF); (2) the Guadalquivir \n\nDiapiric Ridge Field (GDRF); (3) the Tasyo Field; and (4) the Morocco Margin Field - \n\nMMF (Kenyon et al., 2000; Gardner, 2001; Kenyon et al., 2001, 2002, 2003). The latter \n\nwas further subdivided into the West MMF, the Central MMF and he East MMF (Gardner, \n\n2001). More recently, the Eastern MMF was defined as the El Arraiche Mud Volcano \n\nField, which includes the Al Isidri, Mercator Fiuza, Don Quichote, Gemini, Kidd, \n\nLazarilho de Tornes and Adamastor mud volcanoes, and the Vernadsky and the Pen Duick \n\nridges (Rensbergen et al., 2005a; Rensbergen et al., 2005b). \n\nThe middle slope of the northern central part of the Gulf of Cadiz corresponds to the \n\nGDRF (Figure 4.2) where the MDAC were first identified and sampled (Diaz-del-Rio et \n\nal., 2001; Somoza et al., 2002). The GDRF is characterized by several regionally important \n\ndiapiric ridges: the Guadalquivir diapiric ridge (GDR), the Cadiz Ridge (CDR), the \n\nHormigas Ridge (HR) and the Formoza Ridge (FR). The GDR, CDR, HR and FR are \n\ninterpreted as diapiric ridges resulting from lateral compression and by the pressing up of \n\nthe plastic marly clay deposits (blue marls) of the front units of the Early-Middle Miocene \n\npre-olistostrome units, unit M1 of Maldonado et al. (1999), of the front of the \n\nolistostrome/accretionary complex (Somoza et al., 2003). Several fluid escape structures, \n\nsuch as mud volcanoes, mud mounds with high abundance of MDAC and pockmarks were \n\nidentified in the GDR. Based on the multibeam bathymetry and geophysical information, \n\nspecific target areas were selected for detailed underwater video observation and sampling. \n\nSuch areas include several mud volcanoes, mud cones, diapiric ridges and high reflectivity \n\nareas in side-scan sonar backscatter, such as the Iberico and the Cornide mud cones; the \n\nFR, the Coru\u00f1a cone of the GDR; on the Cadiz Channel E of Lolita and at the Cadiz \n\nChannel W of the Iberico. These areas are described above in more detail. \n\nThe Tasyo MV Field (Somoza et al., 2003) is located south of the GDR and \n\ncorresponds to the Central Gulf of Cadiz. In this area MDAC were identified associated \n\nwith the Hesperides, Faro, Cibeles and Almazan MVs. \n\n\n\nChapter 4. Characterization of areas of MDAC occurrence in the Gulf of Cadiz and their relation to \nother fluid escape structures \n\n 80 \n\nIn the southern part of the Gulf of Cadiz, the Morocco Margin Field (MMF) is \n\ncharacterized by large mud volcanoes, ridges and fault escarpments. MDAC were \n\nidentified and collected along the Pen Duick and the Vernarsky ridges and escarpments \n\nand on the Darwin, Fiuza, Yuma, Ginsburg, Jesus Baraza, Kidd, Meknes, Mercator, \n\nShouen and Student mud volcanoes. \n\nIn the DPF, which includes the Carlos Ribeiro, Olenin, Bomboca, Bonjardim, \n\nSemenovich, Soloviev, Carlos Teixeira and Porto mud volcanoes, until present, MDAC \n\nwere only identified in the Porto mud volcano, although heir presence in other sites cannot \n\nbe excluded. \n\n \n\n4.3.1 MDAC occurrences in the GDR Field and their relationship with \n\nmud volcanoes and mud cones \n\nMDAC were identified on mud cones and mud volcanoes (MV) along two parallel \n\nlinear ridges clearly evident in the bathymetry (Figure 4.2): along the Guadalquivir \n\nDiapiric Ridge (GDR) and along the Formoza Ridge (FR). \n\nOther prominent diapiric ridge, the Cadiz Diapiric Ridge (CDR) which range from \n\n370 to 700 m water depth have a relief of 250 to 300 m high and up to 4500 m wide and \n\nextends for 27 km with a NNE-SSW orientation (Figure 4.2) was not investigated for the \n\noccurrences of MDAC. \n\n4.3.1.1 Guadalquivir Diapiric Ridge \n\nThe GDR crest is located between 380 and 940 m water depth, have an overage relief \n\nof 250 m, up to 4000 m wide and extends for 85 km with an NE-SW orientation (Figure \n\n4.2). The area close to the GDR exhibit several features witch their bathymetric expression \n\nindicated to be mud volcanoes (Somoza et al., 2003). Ground-truthing of some of these \n\nstructures confirmed their mud volcanic nature. Therefore, the Anastasya, Tarsis and \n\nPipoca MV were confirmed in the northern end of the GDR by the presence of mud \n\nbreccia, sediments with high gas content and strong H2S smell in gravity cores (Somoza et \n\nal., 2003). Similar sediment characteristics were recorded from gravity cores in the Gades \n\nMV, located at the northern termination of the FR (Somoza et al., 2003). In the GDR, \n\nMDAC were identified and sampled from the Coru\u00f1a mud cone (D\u00edaz-del-R\u00edo et al., 2003; \n\nSomoza et al., 2003; Le\u00f3n et al., 2006). \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 81\n\n \nFigure 4.2.

This \n\narea was investigated with multibeam, seismics, underwater seabottom photography and \n\ndredging (D\u00edaz-del-R\u00edo et al., 2003; Somoza et al., 2003; Le\u00f3n et al., 2006). \n\nThe Coru\u00f1a is an asymmetric cone shaped mound with a relief of 233 m with \n\nasymmetric flanks and slope gradients up to 24\u00ba (Figure 4.5A). The mound summit s \n\nlocated at 830 m water depth (Figure 4.4A). The bathymetry and the backscatter imagery \n\ndo not show any structures at the mound summit, nor any moat or mud flows. The NRL \n\nSeamap side-scan sonar shows a highly reflectivity surface (Figure 4.4B), similar to the \n\nbackscatter reflectivity of the remaining GDR, with high acoustic reflectivity at the ridge \n\nsummit and on the flanks, contrasting with the lower reflectivity characteristic of the \n\nsedimentary contourite deposits like the ones north of the GDR (compare the contourite \n\ndeposit, c.a. shot point 1200 in profile Psat-125 with the low backscatter reflectivity on the \n\nNRL Seamap, in Figure 4.4B, corresponding to the basin north of the Coru\u00f1a mound). The \n\nseismic profile Psat-215 (Figure 4.5B) illustrates the typical seismic character of chaotic \n\nreflectors and transparent facies typical of the GDR, compared with the coherent reflectors \n\nof the contiguous sediments. The GDR shows a strong seafloor reflection that is interpreted \n\nas being caused by the high abundance of MDAC.  \n\n \nFigure 4.4.

To be noted the chaotic and indistinct seismic \n\nreflection pattern bellow the conical expression of the GDR, contrasting with the parallel reflections of the \n\nsedimentary basin sequences to the W. \n\n \n\nThe dredge ANA2001-DA15 allowed the collection of MDAC samples dominated \n\nby dolomite chimneys and slabs (D\u00edaz-del-R\u00edo et al., 2003). Plastic mud and blue marls \n\nclasts were also retrieved from the Coru\u00f1a mound. The blue marls were interpreted as \n\nbeing of Early-Middle Miocene age and associated with the tectonic compression of the \n\nwedge front of the olistostrome/accretionary complex (Maldonado et al., 1999; Somoza et \n\nal., 2001; D\u00edaz-del-R\u00edo et al., 2003). Fragments of corals were also retrieved from this \n\ndredge. \n\n \n\n4.3.1.1.2 Profile in the GDR North of the Coru\u00f1a mud cone \n\nA profile of underwater TV across the GDR was collected during the TTR11 cruise. \n\nThe interpretation of the seafloor observations are illustrated in Figure 4.6. This profile \n\nstarted in middle slope of the northern flank of the GDR, crossed the ridge summit and \n\n\n\nChapter 4. Characterization of areas of MDAC occurrence in the Gulf of Cadiz and their relation to \nother fluid escape structures \n\n 84 \n\ndescended along the southern flank to the base of the Cadiz Channel. The northern flank, \n\nthe summit and the top part of the southern flank (at a water depth of 880 m) is \n\ncharacterized by outcropping of well lithified rocks with evident parallel bedding, with \n\nabsent or very thin pelagic sediment drape. The stratification appears to be sub-vertical and \n\nthe sedimentary rocks are dominated by claystones. Abundant sub-rounded clasts, probably \n\nfragments of the outcropping rocks are found along the slope. In the southern flank, above \n\n880 m water depth the seafloor is characterized by a sedimentary cover dominated by \n\nsandy sediments with ripples and sand waves. These sedimentary facies are interpreted as \n\ncorresponding to the contourite deposits resultant from the MO that flows with a strong \n\nvelocity at the seafloor along the southern flank of the GDR and along the Cadiz Channel. \n\nDuring the video observations, especially along the southern flank of the GDR, a strong \n\ncurrent could be observed from the movement of particles put in suspension by the video \n\ncamera. Clasts of the outcropping material found scattered on the sandy sediment are \n\ninterpreted as fragments from the upper slope that rolled downwards. In the mid slope a \n\npatch of coral debris was found, about one hundred meters long. This patch is \n\ncharacterized by a dense coverage of coral rubble, composed of abundant fragments of \n\ncoral branches (dead coral; no live coral was positively identified) that partially cover by \n\nsediments. In this patch some gastropods were also identified and fragments of not yet \n\nidentified shells. \n\n \nFigure 4.6. Facies interpretation of the underwater video profile TTR11-TV22. See location in Figure 4.4. \n\n \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 85\n\n4.3.1.2 Formoza Ridge \n\nThe Formoza Ridge (FR) crest is located between 925 and 980 m water depth \n\n(Figure 4.7). The average relief is of about 100 m high, up to 2500 m wide and extends for \n\n8.5 km with an NE-SW orientation (Figure 4.7). The FR is characterized by the presence of \n\na through or erosional channel at the base of the north flank. This channel is most probably \n\nerosional in origin and most probably results from the erosional effect of the outflow of the \n\nMO. \n\nRidges and lineations with this NE-SW orientation are frequently observed in the \n\nnorthern part of the GC. The FR has a NE-SW trend and its prolongation to the south of \n\nthe Cadiz Channel is visible in Figure 4.7, being offset by a section of the Cadiz Channel \n\nthat has a linear and strait walls oriented in a NW-SE conjugate trend. \n\n \nFigure 4.7.

Also shown in the figure the seismic \n\nlines, underwater TV observation profiles and samples collected in this area which were used for this study. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4. Characterization of areas of MDAC occurrence in the Gulf of Cadiz and their relation to \nother fluid escape structures \n\n 86 \n\nDuring the TTR12 cruise (Kenyon et al., 2003) one underwater TV line (TTR-TV-\n\nAT-29) was collected and samples were retrieved by dredging (TTR12-AT-389D) and \n\nwith a TV-controlled grab (TTR12-388Gr) on the southern end on the FR (Figure 4.7). The \n\nTV line video observation started from the north towards the SW along the northern flank \n\nof the southern termination of the Formoza ridge, in an area of strong acoustic backscatter \n\n(Figure 4.9), and continued along the small crest between the depressions that delimit the \n\nridge. The profile is dominated by the occurrence of MDAC at the seafloor, as pipe-like \n\nstructures or chimneys that are broken and lies on the seafloor, as illustrated in Figure \n\n4.11(A-C). In general, these chimneys are intensely fragmented and accompanied by \n\nrubble of small fragments of broken chimneys. The chimneys have variable sizes, up to 2 \n\nmeters long and up to about 0.5 m in diameter. Some of them have clear open central \n\norifices while others are completely filled, as illustrated in Figure 4.11(B-C) and also \n\nrecognised on the samples retrieved and described in Chapter 5. The chimneys are \n\nintensely colonized by benthic fauna of sessile organisms like sponges, sea urchins, \n\nCidaridae and Asterinidae sea stars. Live corals were not collected from this site but some \n\nprobable individual colonies were identified on the video observations occurring over \n\nsome chimneys. Chimneys in the vertical position, protruding from the seafloor, like the \n\none illustrated in Figure 4.11C were identified, but this occurrence is much less frequent \n\nthat the occurrence of the chimneys lying on the seafloor. The chimneys in the vertical \n\nposition also show strong colonization by benthic fauna and their colour and characteristics \n\nindicate that they do not represent active venting structures but are interpreted instead as \n\nrepresenting fossil venting conduits, inactive for a long time. In some of them it was \n\npossible to recognise that at the foot of some vertical chimneys there were often linear \n\npipe-like chimneys lying on the seafloor and aligned, indicating that they represent a \n\nlonger chimneys that has fall down and broken into several fragments. On this profile it \n\nwas also possible to recognise a strong bottom current, with velocities of 1-2 m/s, \n\nestimated from the movement of suspended particles. These bottom currents were also \n\nevident from the movement of some of the benthic fauna that bent due to the current, and \n\nalso from the cable that was hanging from the TV frame that was sometimes bent in a \n\ndifferent direction from that of the movement of the camera. The strong bottom current \n\nwas interpreted as sufficient to remobilise the unconsolidated sediments, resulting in active \n\nerosion of the soft sediments and to promote the exhumation of the MDAC to the seafloor. \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 87\n\nThe slope gradients along the ridge promoted the remobilization of the MDAC and their \n\nconsequent fragmentation. \n\n \nFigure 4.8. Bathymetry, with a slope gradient and a hillshade with illumination from the NW, of the southern \n\ntermination of the Formoza Ridge with the location of the dredge, TV-grab and underwater video observation \n\nprofile collected during the TTR12. \n\n \n\nPavements, crusts and irregular buildups were identified on the video observations, \n\nsometimes occurring simultaneous with the chimneys and MDAC rubble. The pavements \n\n(illustrated in Figure 4.11D-F) occur as thin (several cm thick) crusts that can extend for \n\nseveral square meters, paving the seafloor or occurring as fragmented slabs. These \n\npavements show a coarse texture interpreted as resulting from the incorporation of shells \n\nand fragments of shells in the cemented crust. Their surface was in general irregular with \n\nirregular contours. Compared to the chimneys, the pavements exhibit less intense \n\ncolonization of benthic fauna, which is interpreted as indicating a smaller period of contact \n\nwith the seawater (probably also a younger age). \n\nThe chimneys and crusts were found, in general, within coarse sediments, sometimes \n\nwith a high amount of shell fragments and frequently characterized by ripples and \n\ndecimetre size sand waves (Figure 4.12G-I). In some places, in the northern flank of the \n\nridge and along the crest south of the ridge, outcrops of lithified rock were observed, \n\nprobably claystone, interpreted as corresponding most probably to the blue marls of Early-\n\n\n\nChapter 4.

Some chimneys and pavements were also found \n\non these outcrop sites, but it was not clear that the chimneys and crusts were formed within \n\nthese rocks. It is possible that the chimneys and crusts were remobilized to these sites by \n\nbottom currents and through gravity flows from other sites upslope. \n\n \nFigure 4.9.

This arcuate-shapped ridge, called Hormigas Ridge (D\u00edaz-del-R\u00edo \n\net al., 2003; Somoza et al., 2003), is characterized by the presence of a series of mounds \n\nfrom which Iberico, Cornide and Arcos exhibit the highest relieves and strongest acoustic \n\nbackscatter reflectivity on the NRL Seamap imagery. \n\nThe Iberico mud cone was surveyed during the TTR11 and Anastasya campaigns and \n\nthe Cornide, Arcos and Coru\u00f1a were surveyed during the Anastasya campaigns. The \n\nsurveys of these structures included seismics, deep towed side-scan sonar, underwater \n\nobservations and sampling with dredges (Kenyon et al., 2002; D\u00edaz-del-R\u00edo et al., 2003; \n\nSomoza et al., 2003). \n\nThese mounds (Iberico, Cornide, Arcos and Coru\u00f1a) are characterized by the \n\noccurrence of MDAC, dominated by dolomite chimneys (D\u00edaz-del-R\u00edo et al., 2003) as \n\nillustrated in Figure 4.20, which occur as dense fields that cover most of the structures \n\narea. \n\n\n\nChapter 4.

Bathymetric relief with a slope and hillshade with illumination from the NW and work \n\nperformed on the Hormigas Ridge (marked by the dashed red line and with the limits are marked by the \n\narrows). \n\n \n\n4.3.1.3.1 Iberico \n\nThe Iberico mud cone has a conical, asymmetric morphology (Figure 4.15), with a \n\ntriangular section shape. Their summit is located at 874 m water depth and it is 156 m high \n\nin relation to the surrounding ridge in which it is located. The diameter of the cone ranges \n\nfrom 1200 to 1700 m. The southward and the eastward flanks have the steepest gradients, \n\nup to 26.7\u00ba, while the northward flank has slopes of 8 to 17\u00ba (Figure 4.16). The summit of \n\nthe cone does not show any particular distinct feature from the flanks. \n\nIberico is located on the western end of the Hormigas ridge that borders the northern \n\nlimit of the Cadiz MO Channel. In relation to the ridge morphology, the Iberico mount is \n\nbordered in the southern flank by a 40 m depression or moat (feature Ms marked by the \n\nwhite dashed line in Figure 4.18B). The northern flank is also borded by a larger and \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 93\n\ndeeper depression where a smaller asymmetrical depression, a pockmark, or an erosional \n\nscour hole is observed on both the bathymetry and the MAK side-scan sonar imagery \n\n(feature P1 and P2 in Figure 4.18A). \n\nThe seafloor reflection of the Iberico mound is higher than the seafloor reflection of \n\nthe surrounding sediments. While the acoustic penetration obtained with the used system, \n\nin the Iberico and within the ridge area, was not sufficient to discriminate the nature and \n\ndimensions of the contact between the feeder channel under the Iberico and the \n\nsurrounding sedimentary sequence, it is possible to distinguish the chaotic and indistinct \n\nseismic reflection pattern under the Iberico from the stratified host sediment reflectors \n\n(Figure 4.17). \n\n \nFigure 4.15. 3D bathymetric morphology of the Iberico mud cone. (A) view from SW of Iberico. (B) view \n\nfrom NE of the Iberico. \n\n \n\nIn the Iberico mud cone several samples (as illustrated in Figure 4.20) were collected \n\nby dredging along the south flank during the TTR11 cruise (sample TTR11-335D, with the \n\nposition of this dredge plotted by the black arrow in Figure 4.18A) and during the Ana00-\n\nDA10 dredge (D\u00edaz-del-R\u00edo et al., 2003) from the Anastasya 2000 cruise (ship navigation \n\ncorresponds to the yellow line in Figure 4.18A). Both dredges allowed the collection of \n\nlarge number of MDAC of dolomite-dominated chimneys and dolomite-dominated crusts \n\n(the study of these samples is described in Chapter 5). Plastic mud and blue marls clasts \n\nwere also retrieved from these dredges. The blue marls have been interpreted as being of \n\nEarly-Middle Miocene age and expressing the wedge front of the olistostrome/accretionary \n\ncomplex (Somoza et al., 2001; D\u00edaz-del-R\u00edo et al., 2003). \n\n\n\nChapter 4.

To be noted the chaotic and indistinct seismic reflection pattern \n\nbellow the surface conical expression of the Iberico cone, contrasting with the parallel reflections of the \n\nsedimentary basin sequences. \n\n \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 95\n\nThe Iberico mud cone exhibits a strong but differential acoustic backscatter on the \n\nNRL 12 kHz Seamap side-scan sonar imagery and also on the deep-towed high resolution \n\n30 kHz MAK profile TTR11-42 (Figure 4.18B). The southern and the northern flanks of \n\nthe cone are characterized by a strong backscatter but with distinctive patterns. While the \n\nsouthern flank and the upper part of the northern flank (area highlighted by the yellow \n\ndashed line in Figure 4.18B) are characterized by a very strong backscatter with an \n\nhomogeneous pattern, which is interpreted as corresponding to areas recovered by MDAC \n\n(pictures A and C from Figure 4.19) the northern and the western lower slopes of the \n\nmound are characterized by a strong backscatter with sharp, near parallel shadows \n\ninterpreted as indicating rock outcrops with bedding faulting and folding (area highlighted \n\nby the brown dashed line in Figure 4.18B). To the eastern of the mound, the side-scan \n\nsonar images show a weaker reflectivity that, also according to the seafloor observations, is \n\ninterpreted as corresponding to pelagic sediment cover with sand waves and sand ribbons \n\nwith absence of MDAC. To the W off the Iberico the seafloor is characterized by sediment \n\ndrift deposits (as observed on the 5 kHz MAK profiler). \n\nOn the Iberico mud cone two underwater video camera lines (TTR11-TV-18 and \n\nTTR11-TV-19) were carried out during the TTR11 cruise (Kenyon et al., 2002; Magalh\u00e3es \n\net al., 2005). Profile TTR11-TV-18 was acquired from E to W, approximately at a constant \n\ndepth, along the mid slope of the northern flank of the mud cone. The profile initially \n\nshowed a seafloor covered by pelagic oxidized sediments, with scattered occurrence of \n\nfragments of carbonate clasts and some scarce chimneys and coral debris. This portion of \n\nthe profile corresponds to an intermediate backscatter reflectivity in the MAK SSS. A \n\nlarger occurrence of coral debris was observed when a water depth of 960 m was reached \n\nand from there on the profile was characterized by an almost continuous occurrence of \n\nchimneys, most of them very fragmented and lying broken at the seafloor, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 4.19A. When approaching the base of the cone, the occurrence of carbonate \n\nchimneys becomes less frequent and then pelagic sediment with scarce fragments of \n\nchimneys and scarce clasts, similar to the observed at the beginning of this profile is \n\nobserved. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4.

On this mound no structures typical of a mud volcano edifice, \n\nevidencing mud flows are found (Figure 4.21). On the NRL Seamap side-scan sonar \n\nimagery the Cornide is characterized by very strong backscatter intensity on the steep \n\nslopes and on its summit. The northern smooth flanks are characterized by a moderate \n\nbackscatter intensity (Figure 4.22). \n\nDuring the Anastasya campaigns, two dredge sampling stations were carried out on \n\nCornide. Dredge ANA01-Dr01 was acquired along the summit and top of the eastern flank \n\nand allowed the collection of crusts and chimneys similar to the ones collected on the \n\nIberico mud cone. Dredge ANA01-Dr02 was acquired along the western and northern \n\nflanks, crossing the top of the mound, west of the summit. This dredge, like the previous \n\nones allowed the collection of pipe-like dolomite chimneys and slabs, and clasts of blue \n\nmarls (Somoza et al., 2002; D\u00edaz-del-R\u00edo et al., 2003) similar to the ones collected on the \n\nIberico mud cone. On the cone summit, a gravity core allowed the identification of mud \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 99\n\nsediment with a strong H2S smell, an high vacuolization of the sediment, interpreted as \n\nindicating a high gas content in the core, but no mud breccia typical of mud volcanoes was \n\npositively identified (Diaz del Rio et al., 2001). \n\nUnderwater photographs taken during the Anastasya 2001 campaign also allowed \n\nrecognizing that the summit of the Cornide was covered by pipe-like chimneys with a \n\nsimilar aspect to the underwater pictures from the Formoza ridge and from the Iberico cone \n\n(Somoza et al., 2002). \n\nOn the Cornide summit, heat flow stations were also performed allowing the measure \n\nof a seabottom sediment temperature of 12\u00baC and the estimation of a thermal gradient of \n\n23.68, an heat flow value of 29.34 (mW/m2) and a conductivity of 1.239 W/m-K (Gardner \n\net al., 2001). The heat flow data revealed fluctuations in the upper meters of the sediment \n\ncolumn (Figure 4.23) reflecting short term bottom water temperature changes of the order \n\nof less than a year. From the estimated thermal gradient, Gardner et al. (2001) estimated a \n\ngas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) with a thickness of 125 m at 1052 m water depth. \n\n \nFigure 4.21.

The dredge \n\ndid not allow the collection of any material as the cable broke during the retrievement of \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 101\n\nthe dredge, due to excess of loading of the dredge container. However, underwater \n\nphotography from this area allowed the recognition of carbonate chimneys and crusts, \n\nsimilar to the ones from Cornide. \n\n4.3.1.3.3 Arcos \n\nOn the northern termination of the Hormigas ridge, the Arcos mound is characterized \n\nby an irregular topography with a height of 100 m relative to the base of the Cadiz channel \n\nand steep gradient slopes. The summit of the Hormigas ridge in this area exhibits crests \n\nwith an irregular linear shape and with horizontal steps to the north flank that intercalate \n\nthe ridge crest (Figure 4.21). This area is characterized by strong backscatter on the NRL \n\nSeamap side-scan sonar imagery (Figure 4.22) and 3 dredge profiles were acquired in this \n\narea during the Anastasya 2001 cruise. Dredges ANA01-Dr18 and 19 allowed the \n\nrecovering of crusts and chimneys, similar to the ones collected in Formoza, Iberico and \n\nCornide. During the Dredge ANA01-Dr19 clasts of blue marls and limestones were also \n\ncollected, which were interpreted as corresponding to fragments of rock outcrops. \n\n \n\n4.3.2 The Tasyo Field \n\nThe Tasyo Field is considered to be delimited to the north by the southern edge of \n\nthe Cadiz Channel and its southern limit is defined by the Captain Arutyunov and the Atlas \n\nmud volcanoes. The morphology of the Tasyo Field area is characterized by the \n\ninterfingering of several distinct processes. Several fluid escape structures, such as mud \n\nvolcanoes and pockmarks can be distinguished on the bathymetry and sonar backscatter. \n\nThis area is dominated by erosional and sedimentary features related to the outflow of the \n\nMediterranean water. On its eastern sector, within the main Channel of the MO, there is a \n\ndominance of proximal scour and ribbon features with abrasive surfaces with rock \n\noutcrops, sand dunes and sand ribbon fields. Outside of the main Channel of the MO, the \n\noverflow sedimentary lobe sector is characterized by the presence of mud waves and \n\nerosive scours, seafloor slides, mud waves fields, contouritic levees and overflow MO \n\nchannels and furrows (Hernandez-Molina et al., 2003; Hernandez-Molina et al., 2006). \n\nThis sector is also characterized by large negative depressions, some of which resemble \n\nscars of sediment slides that transport material towards the lower slope and to the \n\nHorseshoe Abyssal Plain. Intra-slope mini-basins with a diameter of 800 - 4000 m are also \n\n\n\nChapter 4. Characterization of areas of MDAC occurrence in the Gulf of Cadiz and their relation to \nother fluid escape structures \n\n 102 \n\nobserved in this area. \n\nIn the Tasyo Field, the Hesperides, Cibeles, Faro and Almazan mud volcanoes were \n\ninvestigated in detail for the occurrence of MDAC. \n\n4.3.2.1 Hesperides \n\nThe Hesperides mud volcano (Figure 4.24) is the largest mud volcanic structure \n\nidentified in the Tasyo Field (Somoza et al., 2003). It has a complex morphology with six \n\nsingle cone-shaped domes (labelled C 1 to C6 in Figure 4.24), with diameters ranging from \n\n400 m to 1.1 km. These cones sit over a small plateau that defines the mud volcano \n\ncomplex and has a total seafloor diameter of about 3 km (Figure 4.24). The global shape of \n\nthe complex is irregular, but most of the cones exhibit a regular symmetrical conical shape \n\n(Figure 4.24). The summits of the complex range from 685 to 740 m water depth, and have \n\na maximum height of 75 m (c.a. for the cone C1) in relation to the plateau and about 200 m \n\nin relation to the surrounding seafloor. The Hesperides MV has slopes with smooth \n\ngradients, up to 16\u00ba but in general less than 10\u00ba within the plateau (Figure 4.25A). Nearby \n\nof the MV complex, it is possible to identify several depressions or mini-basins on the \n\nbathymetry, up to 2.4 km wide (structure B1 in Figure 4.24). It is also possible to identify \n\nlow-relief sub-circular depressions, some of which have a small positive relief at their base \n\n(e.g. structure P1 in Figure 4.24), which are interpreted as possible pockmarks. \n\nThe Seamap imagery of the complex exhibits strong acoustic backscatter intensity \n\nover some of the cones (C1, C2, C5 and C6) and moderate backscatter over the remaining \n\nplateau area, with a stronger intensity at the summits of the C3 and C4 cones (Figure 4.26). \n\nThis is also confirmed by the acoustic seismic seafloor reflection of the parametric \n\nparasound, 5 kHz profiler and even by the single channel seismic profile TTR10-Psat155 \n\nover the Hesperides complex, which exhibits a strong surface reflectivity (Figure 4.25B). \n\nOn the seismic profiles, the subsurface under the MV is characterized by a non-reflective \n\ntransparent facies with chaotic reflectors, typical of the mud volcanic nature of the \n\nstructure (Figure 4.25B). From the seismic reflection profile it is also possible to recognise \n\nthat the MV emplacement produced a deformation of the adjacent contourites, producing \n\nlow amplitude folds of the adjacent host sediments, SE of the MV. \n\nTwo underwater video profiles with Ocean Floor Observation System (OFOS) were \n\nacquired on the Hesperides MV during the GAP cruise (Kopf et al., 2004). OFOS 16 and \n\nOFOS 17 crossed this complex from NE to SW and from S-N respectively (Figure 4.24). \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 103\n\n \nFigure 4.24.

NRL Seamap long range SSS with the facies interpretation plotted over it.  \n\n \n\nThe profile OFOS 16 began at the foot of the flank of cone C6, and showed gravel \n\nhorizons interbedded with mud, interpreted as outcrops of older mud-breccia flows. \n\nChimney fragments and carbonated rubble were also found scattered on the mud sediments \n\nbut sometimes they occurred as dense patches on the seafloor. The chimneys and boulders \n\noccur fragmented, laid on the seafloor, colonized by benthic fauna, similar to those \n\nobserved in the Iberico, Cornide or Formoza. Some larger boulders also occur. In the slope, \n\nrising through a broad plateau at the easternmost portion of the complex, in between the \n\ncones C5 and C6, this gently sloping plateau is characterized by the occurrence of scattered \n\ncarbonate clasts within rippled sandy and muddy patches. At the central crest between the \n\ncones C1 and C5, this summit region is characterized by vast carbonate slabs with some \n\nscattered carbonate chimneys. Tubes of Pogonophora sp. were observed overlying the \n\ncarbonate slabs and small bubbles coming up from some fissures were observed in this \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 105\n\narea during the GAP cruise, but to date there is no confirmation of such venting. This area \n\nwas the target of TV grab Station GeoB 9024, which allowed the collection of considerable \n\namounts of carbonate crusts and slabs with numerous interbeded bivalves (Figure 4.30A-\n\nB). Numerous sessile organisms such as small corals, brachiopods, small sponges, were \n\nattached to carbonate crusts. As the track descends to the western flank of the cone into the \n\ndepression between the crest and cone C4, only scattered carbonate crusts and muddy \n\npatches were observed. This depression is characterized by pelagic sediment, with sand \n\nand gravel, probably fragments of carbonats that roll downslope, and mud breccia clasts. \n\nAlong the upper slope and summit of cone C4, chimneys and carbonate rubble and \n\nboulders were again observed at the seafloor of mud breccia-like sediment (as confirmed \n\nby the gravity core ANA00-Gc12, Figure 4.31). Patches of coral debris were also \n\nobserved. The southwestern flank of cone C4 is characterized by the dominance of mud \n\nbreccia sediments alternating with patches of sand and gravel. Carbonate fragments occur \n\nvery rarely. This facies is also characteristic of the northeastern flank of cone C3. Near and \n\nat the summit of C3 the seafloor is characterized by the occurrence of scattered clasts, \n\nprobably of mud breccia clasts. The southwestern flank of C3 is characterized by mud \n\nbreccia-type sediments (as confirmed by the gravity cores ANA00-Gr10, ANA00-Gr11, \n\nGeoB 9019 and GeoB 9019; Figure 4.31) with occurrence of slabs and crusts, large \n\ncarbonate boulders, small patches of fragmented shells and fields of gastropods, some of \n\nthese patches of gastropods; extend for about 10 m. Coral debris were also found along this \n\nslope. At the base of the Hesperides plateau, close to the end of this profile, the seafloor is \n\ncharacterized by sandy sediments, sometimes with ripples. \n\n \nFigure 4.27.

Facies interpretation of the OFOS 17 video profile. Labels 1, 2 and 3 show the location of still \n\nvideo camera pictures presented in Figure 4.29. \n\n \n\nOFOS 17 began at the northernmost flank of the Hesperides mud volcano complex. \n\nThe seafloor was covered by a high density of carbonate chimneys, lying broken on the \n\nseafloor and highly fragmented. The northern flank of the cone C5 is characterized mainly \n\nby muddy areas with patches of rippled sands and scattered carbonate crusts and chimneys. \n\nThe summit of cone C5 and the crest between cones C5 and C1 is characterized by a dense \n\ncoverage by carbonate pavements and crusts. This OFOS crossed the previous profile at \n\nthe crest confirming the previous observation of abundant tubes of Pogonophora sp. tube \n\nworms. At the northern flank of cone C1 and at the summit, patches of coral debris were \n\nobserved but the summit of C1 is characterized by extensive fields of pavements and \n\ncarbonate crusts, sampled by TV-controlled grab at stations GeoB 9022 and GeoB 9023 \n\n(samples are illustrated in Figure 4.30). The summit of C1 is characterized by the \n\noccurrence of extensive coverage of deep water coral, forming reef-like patches. A patch \n\nof this coral debris was sampled with TV grab GeoB 9022 (Figure 4.30). It consists of dead \n\ncoral rubble with small broken coral pieces and coral branches up to 30 cm in length and \n\nprobably originating from species such as Lophelia pertusa, Madrepora oculata, and \n\nDesmophyllum. Several gastropods, brachiopods and small hydrozoa were found attached \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 107\n\nto the dead coral pieces. Some small living coral species settled on the dead coral branches \n\noccasionally. Numerous carbonate slabs, crusts and fragments of chimneys were also \n\ncollected in this grab sample (Figure 4.30). Most of the chimney pieces are oxidized as \n\nindicated by the brown to light brown colours, and vary in shape and size from a few \n\ncentimetres up to 40 cm across. Small corals and encrusting organisms are attached to the \n\nchimneys. Along the southern flank of the cone C1, a high density of carbonate chimneys, \n\nsome about 2 meters long, were observed together with some coral debris patches similar \n\nto the ones on the summit. \n\n \nFigure 4.29.

More than 300 kg of carbonate chimneys were collected, with cylindrical, \n\nmounded, branched, or mushroom shapes. Small corals, sponges, brachiopods and other \n\nlittle organisms were attached to the chimney pieces. The final part of the OFOS 17 profile \n\ncorresponds to the pool-like structure at the base of the southern flank of C1 and the base \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 109\n\nof the Hesperides MV complex. This depression has an oval shape and many current \n\nstructures were observed during the video profiles, such as rippled sands, probably as \n\nconsequence of the MO. The presence of the MO is also supported by the warmer seawater \n\ntemperature and by the anomalous temperature gradients recorded in the heat flow stations \n\n(GeoB 9025-1, GeoB 9025-2 and ANA01-Sc15) in this area (Gardner et al., 2001; Kopf et \n\nal., 2004). \n\nGravity cores ANA00-Gc10 and ANA00-Gc11 at the summit of cone C3, and \n\nANA00-Gc12 at the summit of cone C4, are characterized by the presence of mud breccia \n\n(Figure 4.31) that consists mainly of clasts up 5 cm that were interpreted by Somoza et al. \n\n(2003) as clasts of the \u201cblue\u201d marls, characteristic of the Early-Middle Miocene pre-\n\nolistostromic unit M1 defined by Maldonado et al., (1999); these are thought to be \n\nresponsible for the formation of the marly diapirism (like in the GDR) that occurred in the \n\ncentral area of the Gulf of Cadiz (Maldonado et al., 1999). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.31.

Gravity cores GeoB 9019 and GeoB 9021 retrieved during the GAP cruise (Kopf et al., 2004) \n\nwith mud breccia that indicate the mud volcano nature of the Hesperides. \n\n \n\nMethane concentrations made on the three cores taken on the Hesperides MV cones \n\n(GeoB 9019, GeoB 9020, GeoB 9021) show low values (<0.2 mM), probably reflecting \n\ninactivity or slow rates of fluid venting, forming large amounts of carbonate crusts after \n\nmud volcano formation (Kopf et al., 2004). \n\nThe heat flow station ANA01-Sc15 (Figure 4.33) was collected during the Anastasya \n\nsurvey in September 2001, in the pool-like depression at the base of the Hesperides MV \n\nsouthern of the cone C1 (see Figure 4.24 for location). At this station, the seafloor \n\nsediment temperature of 11.48\u00baC indicates the presence of MO in this structure and the \n\ncalculated thermal gradient of 79.85, heat flow of 106.55 mW/m2 and a conductivity of \n\n1.334 W/m-K allowed the estimation of the depth of the GHSZ at 1068 m, and an \n\nestimated thickness of the GHSZ of 40 m (Gardner et al., 2001). \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 111\n\n \nFigure 4.33. Heat flow station ANA01-Sc15 collected during the Anastasya survey in 2001 in the pool-like \n\ndepression at the base of the Hesperides MV, south of cone C1 (see Figure 4.24 for location). \n\n \n\nOn the Hesperides MV, a transect of 10 heat flow stations (Geob 9025-1 to GeoB \n\n9025-10) was acquired (see Figure 4.24 for location). The stations shown non-linear \n\nthermal gradients (Figure 4.34), especially in the first 2 meters of the sedimentary column. \n\nThese non-linear gradients, similar to the results from the Anastasya 2001 heat flow \n\nstations, were interpreted as the result of the seasonal variations of the bottom water \n\ntemperature, as result of the presence and fluctuations of the MO. However, in some of the \n\nstations of the transect (GeoB 9025-1 and GeoB 9025-6), the heat flow measurements \n\nreached sufficient depth and the deepest sensors provided linear trends of the temperature, \n\nallowing the calculation of the heat flow. Therefore an heat flow value of 73.3 mW/m2 was \n\nestimated for station GeoB 9025-1 and an heat flow value of 36.4 mW/m2 was estimated \n\nfor station GeoB 9025-6 (Kopf et al., 2004). \n\n \nFigure 4.34. Heat flow stations GeoB 9025 collected during the GAP cruise (Kopf et al., 2004) along a \n\nprofile on the Hesperides MV, see Figure 4.24 for location.  \n\n\n\nChapter 4. Characterization of areas of MDAC occurrence in the Gulf of Cadiz and their relation to \nother fluid escape structures \n\n 112 \n\n4.3.2.2 Faro, Cibeles and Almazan \n\nFaro, Cibeles and Almazan MVs are situated located along a major positive relief \n\narcuate structure, with 9 km in diameter and 13 km in length, that links the three MVs \n\n(Figure 4.35). This arcuate structure has slopes with gradients up to 18\u00ba and the highest \n\ngradients are found in the SW flank of the Cibeles MV (Figure 4.36B). Cibeles is located \n\nat the W limit of the arc, Faro MV is located in the central part of the arc, and Almazan is \n\nlocated at the E limit of the arc. The arcuate structure has highs ranging from 40 m up to a \n\nmaximum of 120 m in relation to the surrounding high. The arcuate structure is interrupted \n\nby a NW-SE trend linear depression in between the Cibeles and the Faro MVs (Figure \n\n4.35). The area inside the arcuate structure is characterized by a plateau with a smooth \n\ntopography, with small depressions up to 20 m depth and a deeper moat at the border of the \n\ninterior slope of the arc. This structure is characterized by a moderate to high backscatter \n\nreflectivity on the NRL Seamap imagery (Figure 4.36A). \n\n \nFigure 4.35.

The arcuate structure is characterized by \n\nintense folding of the sediments in contact with the piercing structure (Figure 4.37B). On \n\nthe seismic profile TTR09-Psat 120 (Figure 4.37A), which crosses the prolongation of the \n\narc south of Cibeles, although the data quality is not of optimal resolution it is possible to \n\ninterpret that in the prolongation of the arc and on the Cibeles MV, near shot point 230, the \n\nreflectors show an upward deformation similar but less intense than that observed on \n\nprofile TTR11-Psat 213 over the arc\u2019s crest. \n\nThe Cibeles MV is located at the southwestern limit of the arc. It has a triangular \n\npyramidal conical shape with asymmetric flanks. The steepest gradient flanks are the SW \n\nand the SE flanks with up to 18\u00ba slopes. The top is located at 860 m water depth and it has \n\na relief of 150 m above the surrounding seafloor. The SE flank is characterized by a \n\nsmooth depression resembling an erosive moat while at the base of the SW flank 60-70 m \n\ndeep depressions are found. The MV edifice has a maximum diameter of about 2 km along \n\nthe arcuate structure and a minimum diameter of 1.2 km in the NW-SE direction. A gravity \n\ncore (ANA2000-Gc09) taken at the SW flank of the mud volcano allowed the recovery of \n\n15 cm of oxidised brown muddy sands (Figure 4.42A), overlying 155 cm of grey clay \n\nmuds with obvious indications of gas saturation, degassing structures and a strong H2S \n\nsmell, that indicate the mud volcanic nature of this structure. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4.

To be noted the chaotic and indistinct seismic reflection pattern bellow the \n\nsurface conical expression of the Faro MV, contrasting with the parallel reflections of the sedimentary basin \n\nsequences. \n\n \n\nThe Almazan mud volcano is located in the easternmost part of the arc is \n\ncharacterized by a regular and symmetric conical morphology (Figure 4.35 and Figure \n\n4.36B). The MV has a seabed diameter ranging from 1.0 to 1.2 km, a relief of 75 m above \n\nthe surrounding seafloor (Figure 4.35) and steep flanks with slopes ranging from 8\u00ba to 14\u00ba \n\nFigure 4.36B. The top of the MV is located at 845 m water depth. On the NRL Seamap \n\nimagery Almazan is characterized by moderate but differential backscatter intensity. The \n\ntop has a stronger backscatter intensity than the flanks or the base of the MV. High \n\nresolution sparker seismic profiles acquired during the Tasyo campaign (Somoza et al., \n\n2003) show that the surface of the cone is characterized by high-reflectivity coherent \n\nreflectors and the interior of the MV is characterized by indistinct and chaotic seismic \n\nreflection pattern. The mud volcano feeder channel has been identified as a columnar \n\ndisturbance with a chaotic and indistinct seismic reflection pattern below the crest of the \n\nmud volcano, with a diameter of 600 m (Somoza et al., 2003) that cuts the well-stratified \n\nsedimentary sequences. The MV was sampled at its summit with a gravity core \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 115\n\n(ANA2001-Gc08) which allowed the collection of a 107 cm long core with coarse \n\nbioclatic sandy sediments recovering mud breccia sediments with a strong H2S smell, high \n\ncontent of heterogeneous clayish clasts, gastropods and with intercalated layers with \n\nabundant coral and bivalve fragments (Diaz del Rio et al., 2001). The heat flow station \n\nANA2001-Sc08, performed at the summit of the Almazan MV, indicated a bottom water \n\ntemperature of 10.22\u00baC and allowed an estimation of a thermal gradient of 85.81, a heat-\n\nflow of 87.92 (mW/m2), and a conductivity of 1.025 (W/m-K) (Figure 4.38A). Based on \n\nthese data the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) can be estimated at a depth of 862 m with \n\na thickness of 30 m (Gardner et al., 2001). \n\n \nFigure 4.38. Heat-flow stations ANA01-Sc08 and ANA01-Sc14 collected, respectively, at the summit of \n\nAlmazan and Faro MVs during the Anastasya survey in 2001 (Gardner et al., 2001), see Figure 4.35 and \n\nFigure 4.39 for location. \n\n \n\nThe Faro MV is the largest feature in this arcuate structure, it has a conical shape \n\nwith an oval regular section, with a maximum basal diameter of 1.4 km along the NNW-\n\nSSE direction and a minimum diameter of 1.2 km in the orthogonal direction. The summit \n\nof the Faro MV is located at 810 m water depth and represents a relief of 110 m in relation \n\nto the background bathymetric high of the centre of the arcuate structure (Figure 4.39). The \n\nMV has an asymmetric form with slopes of up to 16\u00ba (Figure 4.36B). Seismic reflection \n\nprofiles over the mound show the chaotic seismic facies typical of the MVs (Figure 4.37B) \n\nand high resolution sparker seismic profiles of the Tasyo campaign allowed the \n\nidentification of the MV feeder channel with an apparent  diameter of 1 km at the base of \n\nthe MV (Somoza et al., 2003).

Gravity cores \n\ncollected in the upper slope on the NE flank (GeoB 9032) and at the base of the MV (GeoB \n\n9031) allowed the retrieval of coral bearing sediments (Kopf et al., 2004). Two multi-corer \n\nstations were performed in one location where a possible bacterial mat was interpreted on \n\nthe video profile OFOS-28. However, due to the presence of hardgrounds of aragonite \n\npavements the multi-cores GeoB 9029-1 did not allowed the collection of any sediment \n\nand core GeoB 9029-2 only retrieved 12 cm of mud breccia sediment with fragments of \n\naragonite pavements and bioclasts. \n\n \nFigure 4.39.

NRL Seamap long range SSS with the seafloor facies interpretation from the OFOS28 video \n\nobservations. \n\n \n\nThe OFOS 28 track, illustrated in Figure 4.39 and Figure 4.40, is composed by a NE-\n\nSW profile crossing the summit of the Faro MV, followed by a S-N transect along the W \n\nflank, a NW-SE transect crossing the MV summit, a S-N transect along the E lower flank, \n\nand a ESE-WNW transect on the northern flank. The first transect with a NW-SE direction, \n\nbegan NW of the Faro mud volcano. The surrounding area and the lower flank of the MV \n\nare characterized by pelagic sediment with sandy and muddy patches, sometimes with \n\nripples. Scattered corals occur especially at the base of the MV, where the gravity corer \n\nGeoB 9031 was collected, and at the lower flank, close to the intersection with the ESE-\n\nWNW transect in the area where the gravity corer GeoB 9032 was collected. These two \n\ncores here characterized by pelagic sediments with coral rubble and mud breccia at the \n\nbase (Kopf et al., 2004). Scarce fragments of carbonates forming small buildups and crusts \n\nwere observed at the base of the depression close to the area were the gravity core GeoB \n\n9031 was collected. In the upper slope of the NE flank of the MV the seafloor is \n\ncharacterized by the presence of carbonate crusts, forming slabs, pavements, buildups and \n\n\n\nChapter 4. Characterization of areas of MDAC occurrence in the Gulf of Cadiz and their relation to \nother fluid escape structures \n\n 118 \n\nlarge blocks, some of them up to two meters in size. Scarce chimneys or pipe like \n\ncarbonates are found scattered within the carbonate pavements. Corals and benthic fauna \n\nare frequently found attached to these carbonates. The northern flank near the summit area, \n\nclose to the intersection with the NW-SE OFOS transect is characterized by mud breccia. \n\nThe SW flank of the MV is characterized by dense occurrence of carbonates, forming \n\ncrusts, pavements and slabs, sometimes forming buildups and large blocks with several \n\nmeters in size and with some chimney fragments scattered lying in between the crusts. The \n\nseafloor has similar characteristics to those observed at the summit of Hesperides, but with \n\na lower abundance of MDAC and less massive than on the Hesperides. The carbonates are \n\nfrequently colonized by benthic fauna (corals). In some areas, pogonophora tube worms \n\nwere found, occurring isolated or forming small patches. In the middle slope of the SW \n\nflank, an area of seafloor is covered by mud breccia. The summit and the upper SW flank, \n\nwhere the carbonates are more frequent is characterized by a stronger acoustic backscatter \n\nreflectivity (Figure 4.40). At the foot of the SW flank, the OFOS track continues to the \n\nnorth, and crosses the arcuate structure observed on the previous multibeam bathymetry. \n\nThe area of the base of the MV, corresponding to less intense backscatter intensity on the \n\nNRL Seamap imagery than the summit of the MV, is characterized by muddy sediments \n\nshowing patches of coarser grained sand, with scattered but abundant individual corals, \n\nhydrozoa and scarce carbonate crusts. The southern flank of the arcuate structure and its \n\ncrest are characterized by the dense occurrences of carbonate crusts, slabs, pavements and \n\nbuildups (Figure 4.41A-B), with scattered chimneys between the slabs. Individual corals \n\nare found attached to the carbonates. The northern flank of the arc is covered by mud \n\nbreccia, sometimes recovered by pelagic sediments, often with rippled sand and muddy \n\npatches. When the profile reaches the base of the NW flank of the MV the seafloor is \n\ncharacterized by the occurrence of patches of dense accumulations of bivalves (Figure \n\n4.41C-D) some of which most probably correspond to live Solemyidae due to their \n\nelongated shape and dark brown colours. However, Lucinoma shells seem to be the most \n\nabundant, as confirmed by the TV-Grab sample GeoB 9029-3, collected in this area. This \n\narea is also characterized by carbonate pavements and slabs. Some of these carbonate \n\npavements are apparently covered by white bacterial mats (Figure 4.41E-F). Pogonophora \n\ntubes were also observed associated with the carbonates, bivalves and the bacterial mats. \n\nTwo multicorer stations were acquired with the objective to collect samples of bacterial \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 119\n\nmats. One station was performed in this area (GeoB 9029-1) for that purpose but due to the \n\nhard carbonate pavements such collections was not possible. A second multicorer station \n\n(GeoB 9029-2) was attempted in a closer location dominated by mud breccia sediments in \n\norder to estimate methane concentrations in the sediments but only 10 to 15 cm of mud \n\nbreccia was collected. A TV-controlled grab station (GeoB 9029-3) aimed to sample the \n\nbacterial mat area and aragonite pavement samples were collected with mythilid bivalves \n\nrelated to Calyptogena sp., Solemyidae and Lucinoma shells. Pogonophora tubes were also \n\ncollected but bacterial mats were not retrieved (Figure 4.42B). The chemosynthetic fauna \n\nthat hosts bacterial symbionts (sulphide oxidizing bacteria in their gills) indicate active \n\nhydrocarbon gas expulsion in this area.  \n\nThe OFOS 28 profile (Figure 4.40) along the track from the base of the NW slope to \n\nthe summit of the MV was characterized by mud breccia material with pavements crusts \n\nand chimney carbonates that sometimes occur in denser patches, especially at the MV \n\nsummit. The SE slope, the summit and the upper slope are characterized by mud breccia \n\nwhile the SE lower slope is dominated by pelagic sediment, sometimes with ripples \n\nindicating strong currents near the bottom. At the MV base the seafloor was again \n\ndominated by mud breccia with isolated corals and pogonophora occurring as isolated \n\nindividuals, or in small patches.  \n\nThe next section of the OFOS profile, with a S-N direction showed a pelagic \n\nsedimentary cover at the base of the MV and mud breccia material with isolated individual \n\ncorals attached to some of the mud breccia clasts. \n\nThe last section of the OFOS profile, along the mid slope of the northern flank of the \n\nMV showed, in general, mud breccia sediments with patches of a pelagic sediment cover. \n\nPatches of coral rubble were also observed along this section of the OFOS track. It should \n\nbe noted also the observation of an area with high density of shells and clam shells. This \n\ntrack ended at the previously surveyed area on the NW base of the MV, and once more \n\ncarbonates pavements, slabs and buildups were observed; some of these pavements seem \n\nto host white bacterial mats. Pogonophora and clam fields were also found in between the \n\npavement slabs. \n\nAttempts to sample the southern flank of the arc (TV-Grab GeoB 9030-2) and the \n\nbase of the MV (TV-Grab stations: GeoB 9030-1 and GeoB 9030-3) in areas where \n\nextensive carbonate pavements were observed associated with pogonophora tubes were \n\n\n\nChapter 4.

This area is characterized by \n\nstrong acoustic backscatter intensity on the NRL Seamap 12 kHz side-scan sonar. It was \n\nsurveyed with 30 kHz deep-towed MAK side-scan sonar, with seismics, with underwater \n\nTV video profiles and sampled by dredging (Figure 4.43).  \n\nOn the high resolution deep-towed side-scan sonar (line TTR11-MAK42) this area is \n\nalso characterized by a strong backscatter intensity and shows a pattern of sharp and near \n\nparallel shadows (Figure 4.44) indicative of bedding and faulting of outcrop rocks, similar \n\nto the pattern observed on the N-NW flank of the Iberico mud cone. This pattern is typical \n\nfor the entire Cadiz channel but the eastern side of the channel, illustrated in Figure 4.44, is \n\ncharacterized by strong backscatter intensity. In this area the underwater video profile \n\nTTR11-TV 21 was acquired in order to characterize the seafloor in this rocky headwall of \n\nthe channel. This profile was carried out in a South to North direction along the headwall \n\nof the Cadiz channel starting on a small high, crossing a small depression and ending at the \n\ncrest of a small elevation, as illustrated in Figure 4.43. The seafloor along the underwater \n\nTTR11-TV 21 video profile was characterized by the occurrence of high density of \n\ncarbonate rubble, mainly chimneys lying in the seabottom over outcropping claystone (as \n\nconfirmed by the claystone sample retrieved from the dredge TTR11-339D. The chimneys \n\noccur lying at the seabottom (as illustrated in Figure 4.47A and B), very fragmented, \n\noxidized and colonized by benthic fauna indicating a long period of permanence at the \n\nseafloor. Some buildups and slabs of pavements were also found (as illustrated in Figure \n\n4.47E and F), especially close to the end of the profile. The rocky outcrops were composed \n\nof consolidated claystones that exhibit frequently, up to 1-2 m, scarps (as illustrated in \n\nFigure 4.47C and D) where the blocks of the outcropping rocks are found at their base. \n\nLayering of the rocky outcrops was observed as well as small patches of coral rubble. In \n\ngeneral, the rocky outcrops had no pelagic sediment cover due to the strong bottom \n\ncurrents, as observed by the movement of the soft corals and by the movement of \n\nparticulate maters on the video records. Only small patches of rippled sandy sediments \n\nwere found. \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 123\n\n \nFigure 4.43.

The \n\nmigration of these fluids through the sediments to the seafloor appears, in some places, to \n\nbe controlled by faulting (Pinheiro et al., 2005). Some of the mud volcanoes (Moroccan \n\nmargin) are located along major NW-SE and NE-SW trending faults identifiable on the \n\nNaval Research Laboratory (NRL) side-scan imagery (Gardner, 2001). In other places the \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 127\n\nmud volcanoes appear to be located at the intersection between the NW-SE strike-slip \n\nfaults and trusts of variable orientation that reflect the Gibraltar Arc curvature (Pinheiro et \n\nal., 2005). \n\nThe migration of fluids along these faults is possibly related both to along-slope \n\ngravitational sliding and to the tectonic transpressional deformation of the olistostromes \n\nand the accretionary complex, due to the Africa-Eurasia convergence (Somoza et al., 2000; \n\nSomoza et al., 2001), which induces in places transpressional tectonic movements of the \n\nshale/salt deposits of the olistostromes mass, generating salt/shale arched wedges. It has \n\nalso been suggested that some of the widespread shallow fluid venting on the seafloor, \n\nparticularly in the area of occurrence of carbonate chimneys of the south and southwest of \n\nthe GDR and in the FR, could be explained by the destabilisation of gas hydrates rich \n\nsediments in contact to the MO (Somoza et al., 2000; Somoza et al., 2001). \n\nAlthough a quantitative relationship between the fluid/gas expulsion and the \n\ngeologic/biologic manifestation is not straightforward, it is clear that, qualitatively, the \n\ngeologic and biologic responses are dependent on the fluid and gas compositions and on \n\nthe flux rate and frequency of the eruption episodes. Data on the frequency, composition \n\nand impacts of the expulsion episodes, which imply a long term monitorization of the fluid \n\nescape structures, are difficult to collect and, not yet available for the GC. However, the \n\nseafloor features that result from fluid/gas escape give information on the nature of the \n\nfluids/gas being delivered to the seafloor, on the episodic nature of the processes, and on \n\nthe duration of those events and the delivery rates (Roberts, 2001). \n\nRoberts and Carney (1997) qualitatively correlated the different fluid escape \n\nstructures with relative changes in the rate of vertical flux and expulsion of fluids and \n\ngases (hydrocarbons, pore waters and sediment) to the seafloor (Figure 4.49). The \n\nsediment-prone mud volcanism corresponds to the rapid flux end-member of the fluid \n\nescape feature spectrum. Mud volcanoes and mud flows composed of extruded fluidized \n\nsediments that consist of fine grained sediments and clasts from the underlying sediment \n\nlayers. The opposite end-member of the spectrum of the fluid escape structures \n\ncorresponds to the slow flux of gases and fluids. It is represented by mineral-prone \n\nstructures, such as authigenic carbonates, of which dolomite crusts, nodules and chimneys \n\nand aragonite pavements types are represented in the GC. In this case, the processes of \n\nmicrobial mediated degradation of hydrocarbons (mainly methane) can produce calcium-\n\n\n\nChapter 4.

The intermediate flux rates are frequently associated with the \n\noccurrence of shallow subsurface gas hydrates, where the chemosynthetic communities are \n\nmost common and well developed. \n\n \nFigure 4.49. Schematic summary of the qualitative relationships between the flux of fluids and gases to the \n\nseafloor and the resultant escape structures (Roberts and Carney, 1997).

(B) pictures illustrating \n\nan intermediate case with moderate flux rates, corresponding to surface exposures or shallow gas hydrates \n\nand well-developed chemosynthetic ecosystems and local areas of occurrence of MDAC. (C) pictures \n\ncorresponding to slow flux cases (mineral-prone case) characterized by a sparse or absent chemosynthetic \n\ncommunities and dominance of the MDAC, occurring as pavements, slabs, buildups, mounds, chimneys and \n\nother forms of lithified seafloor. \n\n \n\n4.4.2 MDAC occurrence and characterization \n\nThe MDAC from the Gulf of Cadiz have high variable morphologies and \n\nmineralogies but, as described in Chapter 5, two main lithologic types of MDAC have been \n\nidentified in the collected samples: (I) dolomite-dominated carbonates and (II) aragonite-\n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 129\n\ndominate carbonates. All these MDAC indicate modern or recent methane seepage and its \n\nanaerobic oxidation (mediated by microbial activity) which leads to the precipitation of the \n\nauthigenic carbonates (aragonite, calcite, Mg-calcite and dolomite) resulting in the \n\ncementation of the sediments and the formation of chimneys and other structures. \n\nThe different morphologies of the carbonate structures reflect different flow patterns \n\nthrough the sediments. If the flux of fluid enriched in methane is canalized through the \n\nsulphate reduction zone of the sedimentary column, using borrows or sediment \n\nheterogeneities as pathways, the sulphate-methane interface and consequently the \n\nprecipitation of the authigenic carbonates will occur around these (sulphate semi-closed \n\nsystems) fluid conduits, resulting in the lithification of the sediments and the formation of \n\nthe dolomitic chimneys (as discussed in Chapter 5). Similar formation processes can be \n\nproposed for the formation of the dolomite dominated crusts, nodules and massive forms. \n\nThe aragonite pavement types result from the oxidation of methane at or close to the \n\nseafloor resulting on the formation of buildups or small carbonate mounds or paving the \n\nseafloor with continuous hard-grounds or as crusts, slabs and blocs. \n\nSeep sites and authigenic carbonate deposits were initially assumed to be isolated \n\noccurrences. With the increase of the detailed survey coverage they now have been \n\nencountered in several other locations (between 500 and 4000 m water depth), indicating \n\nthat they are far more common features than previously anticipated (Figure 4.1). \n\nThe seafloor occurrences of these different MDAC, as described from the underwater \n\nobservations, are discussed bellow. \n\n \n\n4.4.2.1 Dolomite crusts and chimneys \n\nThe distribution of the MDAC, observed on underwater video profiles and by sample \n\nretrieval, is correlated with high backscatter acoustic intensities on the side-scan sonar \n\nimagery. The sites of occurrence of the MDAC are characterized by the strongest acoustic \n\nresponse, stronger than the backscatter from mud breccia and even from most of the rock \n\noutcrops that are frequently characterized by the occurrence of particular textural features \n\nthat reflect some characteristic shadows, resulting from the layering and faulting patterns. \n\nThis is illustrated e.g. on the Iberico mud cone (Figure 4.18) where is clear the distinction \n\n\n\nChapter 4. Characterization of areas of MDAC occurrence in the Gulf of Cadiz and their relation to \nother fluid escape structures \n\n 130 \n\nbetween the strong acoustic backscatter of the MDAC, the intermediate acoustic intensity \n\nof the rocky outcrops, and the low backscatter reflectivity of the pelagic sediments. \n\nThe underwater video observations revealed that the dolomite crusts and chimneys \n\noccur as fields with high density of carbonate samples. These carbonate samples exhibit a \n\nlarge variety of shapes and sizes, such as pipe-like, tubular linear shapes, curved or \n\nhelicoidal shapes, conical, branched, nodular, and massive irregular shapes. Their sizes are \n\nhighly variable both in length and diameter. Chimneys with more than 3 m long and up to \n\n0.5 m in diameter were observed. Those chimneys and crusts appear to be broken, \n\nsometimes intensely fragmented, forming carbonate rubble, and occur most of the times \n\nlying on the sea floor. It is very rare to find chimneys that are in the vertical position, \n\nprotruding from the sediments. \n\nIsolated individuals and small colonies of sea urchins, Cnidaria (Hydrozoa and \n\nAnthozoa), Mollusca (Gastropoda and Bivalvia burrows), Annelida (Polychaeta), \n\nArthropoda (Decapoda), Brachiopoda, Echinodermata (Crinoidea, Asteroidea, \n\nOphiuroidea, Echinoidea and Holothuroidea) are frequently found on the chimneys fields. \n\nHowever, no chemosynthetic organisms were found directly associated and in close \n\nrelation with the dolomite chimneys crusts and nodules. Chemosynthetic communities \n\nwere identified only at sites characterized by the occurrence of the aragonite pavement \n\ntypes. In the Hesperides, Faro and Student mud volcanoes, and off Gibraltar, occurrences \n\nof dolomite chimneys and aragonite pavements are found in close spatial proximity or even \n\noccur simultaneously. However, the observed field geometry relationships between the \n\ndifferent MDAC indicate that they had distinct formation periods. The morphologic and \n\ntextural characteristics of the aragonite pavement carbonates show indicators of a recent or \n\npresent day formation while the dolomite carbonates, which occur as fragments and \n\nremobilized pieces, indicate older formation episodes. The benthic organisms found in the \n\nchimney fields use the carbonates as a hard ground for fixation. The chimneys exhibit \n\nvariable but in general strong dark blown colours indicating oxy-hydroxide iron and \n\nmanganese coatings. The benthic colonization of these carbonates and their oxidation \n\ncoatings indicate that they are, in general, in contact with the seawater for a considerable \n\namount of time. \n\nOccasionally, and in especial on the video profile TTR15-TV69 in the Cadiz channel \n\nat the East of Lolita (Figure 4.7), chimneys occur in situ and do not completely outcrop \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 131\n\nfrom the sedimentary formation where they were formed. Sometimes it was possible to \n\nrecognize in some situations a sub-parallel orientation of some chimneys relative to the \n\nsedimentary layering, while others clearly have a sub-vertical orientation. The sub-vertical \n\norientation of some of the chimneys was already suggested by the apparent layering \n\ninterpreted from the granulometric and textural variations in some chimneys (Chapter 5). \n\nThese observations, together with the large variety of the dolomite chimneys, suggest a \n\ncomplex plumbing system for the fluid percolation. In some situations the fluid percolates \n\nupwards, cutting the sedimentary layers, while in other cases the fluid also percolates \n\nhorizontally along more permeable layers tending to form the slab-like crusts and branched \n\nchimneys. Some of the conduit type of chimneys can also result from horizontal flow. \n\nThe areas where the chimneys occur are systematically characterized by strong \n\nbottom currents. These currents, as evidenciated by the transport of particulate matter, by \n\nthe swing of soft corals and by the bent of the wait string attached to the video camera \n\nframe, are considered to have clearly the potential to erode the unconsolidated sediments in \n\nwhich the chimneys formed. In the northern area of the GC, in the GDR field, in the Tasyo \n\nfield and in the ridges West of Gibraltar, these strong currents are related to the \n\nMediterranean Outflow water (MO). In the Moroccan margin, strong currents were also \n\nobserved at the Pen Duick escarpment and in the Vernarsky Ridge. While in this area the \n\norigin of these currents is not so clearly documented as related to the Mediterranean \n\nOutflow (MO), the presence of these structures in the upper and intermediate slope can be \n\ngenerated by these strong currents. Therefore it is possible to propose that strong bottom \n\ncurrents and the MO have an effective control on the outcrop of the dolomite crusts, \n\nnodules and chimneys. It is proposed that the locations where the dolomite chimneys occur \n\nare presently swept by the flowing of the MO and/or other strong bottom currents which \n\ncan remobilize the unconsolidated sediment inside of which the chimneys were formed and \n\ntherefore produce the collapse of the individual chimneys, explaining their present position \n\non the seafloor. Considering this, it is possible to consider that the chimneys may be \n\nformed under the seafloor (as proposed based on the geochemical and mineralogical \n\ncomposition of the carbonates, and discussed in Chapter 5) and gradually exposed at the \n\nseafloor through erosion of the surrounding unconsolidated sediments, which causes them \n\nto loose sustentation and fall down on the seafloor.

Characterization of areas of MDAC occurrence in the Gulf of Cadiz and their relation to \nother fluid escape structures \n\n 132 \n\nmanganese coating, as well as the colonization by the benthic fauna, began after the \n\nchimneys cropped out. \n\n \n\n4.4.2.2 Aragonite pavements \n\nUnderwater video observations revealed that the aragonite pavement type of MDAC \n\noccur as (1) buildups and small mound-like buildups of variable dimensions, some up to 4-\n\n5 m high and several meters in length (e.g. see Figure 4.29); (2) as rough hard-grounds (up \n\nto 50-80 cm thick) that can pave the seafloor for several square meters, with a thin or \n\nabsent sediment cover (e.g. see Figure 4.41B); (3) as crusts and slabs, similar to the \n\npavements or; (4) as nodular masses of few cm size within superficial sediments. The \n\nmounds appear on the underwater video observations as accumulations of chaotically tilted \n\nand fractured blocks, separated by well-defined joints (e.g. Figure 4.29). According to \n\nRoberts (2001) The nodular masses, the hardgrounds and the crusts are most common in \n\nthe intermediate to slow flux rate settings, while the mounded carbonates and the chimneys \n\nare interpreted to be more characteristic of slow flux rate environments. \n\nColonization of these pavements by benthic fauna (non chemosynthetic) is frequent \n\nbut less intense than observed on some of the chimney fields. The aragonite pavements are \n\ncharacterized by having frequently associated chemosynthetic communities. Aggregates of \n\nclam shells, probably most of them dead, were identified on the seafloor observations at \n\nseveral places (e.g. Hesperides, Faro and Porto MVs). Live chemosynthetic fauna \n\n(Calyptogena, Acharax and pogonophora tube worms) were identified and sampled in \n\nclose association with areas of aragonite pavements occurrence. Besides, shells of \n\nchemosynthetic fauna are also present cemented and incorporated in the carbonate \n\nsamples, in the aragonite pavements sub-type: shell crusts (described in Chapter 5). Small \n\nbacterial mats and pogonophora tube worms were also observed in restricted areas of the \n\nFaro MV, in close association with the aragonite pavements (Figure 4.41E-F). \n\n \n\n4.4.3 Chemosynthetic fauna: occurrence and underwater observations \n\nIn the Gulf of Cadiz, macro-scale chemosynthetic organisms were found in lower \n\nabundance when compared with other seepage areas as in the Gulf of Mexico where well \n\ndeveloped macro-scale chemosynthetic communities were found in association with gas \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 133\n\nhydrates (MacDonald et al., 1988; Carney, 1994; Roberts, 2001; Bergquist et al., 2003; \n\nMacDonald et al., 2003). The chemosynthetic fauna in the Gulf of Cadiz include host \n\ninvertebrates with bacterial symbionts such as the Calyptogena, Acharax and pogonophora \n\ntube worms. They were observed only in small areas correlated with recent or more intense \n\nactive hydrocarbon venting sites. \n\nThe microbial communities in the Gulf of Cadiz include sulfate reducing bacteria, \n\nmethanogenic bacteria, sulfide and methane-oxidizing bacteria and bacteria that oxidize \n\nheavier hydrocarbons (Niemann et al., 2006; Santos et al., 2006). The microbial \n\ncommunities are critical to carbon cycling in intermediate to slow seepage environments as \n\nthey have an important role in the precipitation of the MDAC. \n\nSmall patches of probable bacterial mats were identified only at one location in the \n\nFaro mud volcano. They were not detected at the scales normally found in areas of intense \n\nand active seeps like in the Gulf of Mexico or in the East Mediterranean. This is \n\ninterpreted as indicating a present day state of low or inactive fluid venting at the seafloor. \n\nThis is also confirmed by the low to mid range microbial methane turnover and AOM \n\nactivity in the measured mud volcanoes from the Gulf of Cadiz (Niemann et al., 2006). \n\nGas bubbles and sites of active fluid migration were observed only at two locations in the \n\nMercator mud volcano crater, in areas of highly gas-saturated mud breccia. \n\n \n\n4.4.4 Characteristics of mud volcanoes, mud cones and diapiric ridges \n\nThe mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz are morphologically characterized by a moat \n\naround part of the base of the mud volcano cone, this moat can be erosive and/or resultant \n\nfrom the collapse of the structure as result of the overburden and stress release after the \n\neruptions. The mud volcanoes are also characterized by an irregular slope with radial \n\noutward sediment flows, terraces and/or depositional sediment flow escarpments (lobe \n\nfronts). The summit of the mud volcanoes is in general characterized by a crater \n\ndepression, or shows a flat top, or sometimes a central dome. The mud volcanoes in the \n\nGC are characterized by positive topographic features with diameters up to 5.4 km and up \n\nto 255 m high, like the Al Idrissi MV (Rensbergen et al., 2005a; Rensbergen et al., 2005b). \n\nThe mud volcano edifices are composed by the stacking of successive deposits of fluidised \n\n\n\nChapter 4. Characterization of areas of MDAC occurrence in the Gulf of Cadiz and their relation to \nother fluid escape structures \n\n 134 \n\nsediments composed by clay material, water, gases and clasts or rock fragments from the \n\ndifferent strata crossed by the mud volcano conduit and or from the source layer. \n\nThe mud volcanoes from the Gulf of Cadiz are characterized by the presence of mud \n\nbreccia sediments, composed of a mixture of clay rich sediment with fragments of exotic \n\nrocks that have high variable sizes and nature (clasts). The most abundant clasts \n\ncorrespond to claystones from which a significant percentage correspond to the plastic mud \n\nand blue marls clasts interpreted as being of Early-Middle Miocene age and expressing the \n\nwedge front of the olistostrome/accretionary complex (Somoza et al., 2001; D\u00edaz-del-R\u00edo \n\net al., 2003). \n\nThe mud breccia sediments are also characterized by a high gas (essentially methane) \n\ncontent and also by high H2S contents. On mud volcanoes where gas hydrates where \n\ncollected, the mud breccias exhibit a mousy like texture with high amounts of vacuoles and \n\nhigh water content. This texture results from the dissociation of gas hydrates. Gas hydrate \n\npieces were collected from the cores only when they had sizes sufficient to resist to their \n\ndissociation during the time of their retrieval. \n\nThe study of the mud breccia and the clasts from mud volcanoes from the Gulf of \n\nCadiz allowed the identification of microfossils indicating ages ranging from Upper \n\nCretaceous, Eocene and Miocene-Pliocene (Ovsyannikov et al., 2003; Pinheiro et al., \n\n2003). However, the complex tectonic evolution and structure of the Gulf of Cadiz and the \n\nlocation of the mud volcanoes within the accretionary wedge complex, where several \n\nmelange/olistostrome bodies are present, which can contain a mixture of several source \n\nrocks. The accretionary wedge geometry with major and deep thrusts can also bring deeper \n\nstrata to close to the surface or even at the surface, as observed on the diapiric ridges where \n\nthe upper Miocene blue marls are exposed at the seafloor. Therefore, the oldest ages \n\ndefined from the mud breccia clasts are not clear indicators of the deepest and the source \n\nlayers of the mud volcanoes. Nevertheless, the seismic profiles, the age information of the \n\nmud breccia clasts and the pressure and temperature conditions estimated from the pore \n\nwater geochemistry, suggest that the mud volcanoes are most probably deeply rooted. \n\nThe MVs from the Gulf of Cadiz, as other examples from onshore and submarine \n\nMVs, exhibit sedimentological and geometric characteristics supporting their episodic, \n\nrapid and sometimes violent expulsion events. As regards the GC mud volcanoes, these \n\nevidences are interpreted based on seismic, acoustic, morphologic and sedimentary \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 135\n\nanalysis. The identification of eruptive mud flow episodes are recognised from the \n\ndifferent backscatter intensities between the more recent mud flows, with high acoustic \n\nbackscatter, when compared with the moderated backscatter intensities of the older flows \n\nrecovered by pelagic sediments (e.g. Figure 4.50A). The recognition of mud flows is also \n\npossible from detailed bathymetry of the mud volcanoes (Rensbergen et al., 2005a). \n\nEpisodes of mud flows deposition are also recognized from the christmas tree facies where \n\nan inter-fingerings of acoustic transparent or chaotic seismic facies, typical of mud breccia \n\nflows, intercalate with the coherent and continuous reflectors from the sedimentary layers. \n\nThe intercalation of hemipelagic sediment layers within mud breccia flows, as recognised \n\non the 3.76 m long gravity core GeoB 9037-1 collected on the slope of the Captain \n\nArutyunov MV and shown in Figure 4.50B, allowed to recognise three individual layers of \n\nmud breccia, corresponding to different mud flows episodes intercalated with pelagic \n\nsediment that indicates MV inactive periods (Kopf et al., 2004). \n\nMud volcanoes are characterized on the side-scan sonar by a stronger acoustic \n\nbackscatter than the surrounding pelagic sediment cover. This stronger backscatter \n\nreflectivity is attributed to the presence of clasts on the mud breccia and also due to the \n\noccurrence of the MDAC that are also frequently found within the mud volcano edifice. \n\nThe high reflectivity of the surface of the mud volcanoes is also evident on seismic profiles \n\nas the seafloor amplitude over them corresponds to a clear strong positive anomaly when \n\ncompared to the surrounding pelagic sediments. \n\nOn the seismic profiles the mud volcanoes are generally characterized by \n\nacoustically opaque, chaotic and indistinct seismic patterns, which extend from the \n\nseafloor into the subsurface (e.g. Figure 4.25B). The general interpretation for these \n\nacoustic wipeout zones is that they result of the presence of free gas (bubbles) in the \n\nsurface and near-surface sediments, or is the acoustic response of the mud breccia deposits \n\nthat correspond to material that is structurelles as result of the sediment remolding along \n\nthe subsurface feeder channel and mud flows resulting from the mud extrusion and gas \n\nescaping. This is supported by the fact that some of the mud volcanoes that are inactive \n\nshow this chaotic seismic pattern, indicating that this characteristic is maintained in the \n\nsystems and therefore is not an evidence of present activity or of the presence of free gas \n\nwithin the MV. On seismic profiles, the gas-charged sediments are identified by the high \n\n\n\nChapter 4.

Mud volcanoes on the deformation front of Barbados prism \n\n(Henry et al., 1996) and in the Haakon Mosby mud volcano offshore Norway with high \n\nthermal gradient and heat flow of 1000 mW m-2 (Eldholm et al., 1999) are examples of the \n\nhighest heat flux settings. Other mud volcanoes, such as Mound Culebra offshore Costa \n\nRica have heat flow values of 35-50 mW m-2, 30-80% higher than the regional background \n\nvalues (Grevemeyer et al., 2004). In the vicinity of mud volcanoes from the Mediterranean \n\nRidge, heat flow values were observed to just slightly increase towards the mounds \n\n(Camerlenghi et al., 1995). \n\nThe heat-flow measurements from the Gulf of Cadiz performed during the GAP and \n\nAnastasya 2001 cruises have recorded the only heat-flow values available from mud \n\nvolcanoes in this area. Due to the presence of the MO that flows close to the seabottom at \n\nwater depths between 400 and 1400 m, the heat-flow measurements are affected by the \n\nseasonal bottom water temperature variations. As the MO has significant seasonal \n\nvariations, the transient changes in the temperature of the water column will cause \n\ntemperature waves which will propagate from the seafloor downwards and therefore \n\noverprint the internal upward heat flux. An example of this effect is the record of the \n\nHesperides MV that is characterized by non-linear gradients Figure 4.34. Nevertheless, \n\nheat-flow measurements from mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz recorded low heat-flow \n\nvalues in the Captain Arutyunov (17-22 mW m-2), Hesperides (73-100 mW m-2) and \n\nGinsbug MVs (Gardner et al., 2001; Kopf et al., 2004). The Bonjardim was the mud \n\nvolcano that showed higher heat-flow values (66-163 mW m-2) pointing to a stronger \n\nactivity in this structure than on the Captain Arutyunov, Hesperides and Ginsbug MVs \n\n(Kopf et al., 2004). \n\n \n\n4.4.5 Temporal and spatial relationship between the MDAC, \n\nchemosynthetic organisms and the MV, MD and diapiric ridges \n\nThe fluid escape structures from the Gulf of Cadiz represent a high degree of \n\ngeologic and biologic variability associated with the type, intensity and duration of the \n\nfluxes.

Characterization of areas of MDAC occurrence in the Gulf of Cadiz and their relation to \nother fluid escape structures \n\n 138 \n\nemplacement (and/or possibly accompanying by suspended sediments), will create \n\nenvironmental conditions that are hostile for the benthic fauna (Figure 4.51A and D). For \n\nfilter feeders, the high suspended sediment loads overwhelm their respiratory systems and \n\nthe mud flows can burry them or made their life difficult or impossible and preclude \n\nsulfide-producing anaerobic oxidation of hydrocarbons. \n\nAs rapid flux systems become progressively less active, these systems can start to \n\nacquire superficial features characteristic of moderate to slow and more fluid/gas \n\ndominated seepage. After a mud flow emplacement, if the mud breccia has enough high \n\nhydrocarbon (essentially methane) and a high sulfide content, these environments can be \n\nsuitable for methane oxidizing and sulfate reducers to develop and carbonate precipitation \n\nwill be induced and simultaneously the mat-forming bacteria Beggiatoa may colonize the \n\nsurface of the mud flow. Lucinid and vesycomyid clams can then colonize the mud flows if \n\nthe biodegradation of the incorporated hydrocarbons produces a sufficient sulfide source \n\n(Figure 4.51B). However, since the mud breccia expulsion events are episodic, any mud \n\nflow deposits have a limited hydrocarbon charge and therefore a limited sulfide-production \n\npotential. For this reason, infaunal lucinid clam communities establish themselves and \n\nquickly deplete the available sulfide source (Figure 4.51C). This is in agreement with their \n\nseafloor distribution as the clam shells superficial accumulations observed occur frequently \n\nscattered over the surface of extruded muds. Only in places where there is e.g. a tectonic \n\nfocalization of the fluids and gases that can escape slowly to the seafloor, can these \n\nsystems provide long term methane supply that can be stored as gas hydrates deposits at \n\nshallow depths, and/or fuel the methane oxidizers/sulfate reducers and subsequent sulfide \n\noxidizers communities. These settings will also be associated with an intense MDAC \n\nformation. This can explain the location of the MDAC and larger chemosynthetic \n\necosystems that are most frequently found in the mud volcano crater or at its flanks where \n\nthere is some focalization of fluid and gas seepage (Figure 4.51C). \n\nTherefore, dormant or marginally active phases of the mud volcanoes may contain \n\ngas hydrates, authigenic carbonates and localized chemosynthetic communities. In fact, the \n\nmud volcanoes from which gas hydrates were collected from (Bonjardim, Captain \n\nArutyunov and Ginsburg) or from which strong evidences of gas hydrates were identified, \n\nwere also characterized by the presence of live chemosynthetic communities with lucinid-\n\nvesycomid clams, pogonophora, vestimentifera tube worms and bathymodiolid mussels.  \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 139\n\n \nFigure 4.51.

(D) new phase of rapid flux with a mud-prone dominated event that covers the previous \n\nMDAC and chemosynthetic communities. \n\n \n\nThrough time, the mud volcanoes will successively go through different phases of \n\nactivity, from a mud-prone phase of mud breccia extrusion with the rapid emplacement of \n\nmud flows, to a subsequent phase of moderate flux, dominated by water and gas can result \n\nin the accumulation of shallow gas hydrates, to the cementation of the mud breccia \n\nsediments and the formation of other types of MDAC and support of chemosynthetic \n\n\n\nChapter 4.

A subsequent phase of reduced flux, dominated also by water and gas flux \n\nwill result in further formation of MDAC and a decrease of the chemosynthetic \n\ncommunities. \n\nIn the Gulf of Cadiz the mud volcano fluids including gases are vertically focused by \n\nfaults and by the mud volcano conduits, as the gas hydrates, MDAC and the \n\nchemosynthetic communities were found within the mud volcano edifices (Porto, Faro, \n\nDarwin, Fiuza, Yuma, Ginsburg, Jesus Braza, Kidd, Meknes, Mercator, Shouen and \n\nStudent), mud cones (Iberico, Cornide), diapiric ridges (FR, GDR, Hormigas) and fault \n\nscarps (Pen Duick, Vernarsky ridge, Ridge W Gibraltar, Cadiz channel), and no regionally \n\nbottom-simulating reflectors were found until now. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.5 Conclusions \n\n \n\nThe sites where MDAC occur are in close relation with mud volcanoes (MV) and \n\nmud cones (MC), within diapiric ridges, fault scarps and probably faults in the channels of \n\nthe Mediterranean Outflow (MO), indicating that MV, MC, diapirs and faults are the \n\npreferential pathways for fluid escape. Underwater seafloor video observations suggest that \n\nthe MO can have an effective control on the occurrence of the MDAC, promoting their \n\nformation (as discussed in Chapter 6). The MO has also a control on the occurrence of the \n\ndifferent types of authigenic carbonates, as the dolomitic dominated MDAC mainly occur \n\nin places where the MO has a strong erosive effect (Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2005). \n\nThe MDAC chimneys have a large variability of shapes and sizes, such as pipe-like, \n\ntubular linear shapes, curved or helicoidal shapes, conical, branched, nodular and massive \n\nirregular shapes. Their sizes are highly variable both in length and diameter. Chimneys \n\nwith more than 3 m long and up to 0.5 m in diameter were observed. These chimneys and \n\ncrusts appear broken, sometimes intensely fragmented, forming carbonate rubble and they \n\noccur most of the times lying on the sea floor. It is very rare to find chimneys that are in a \n\nvertical position, protruding from the sediments. \n\nThe aragonite MDAC pavements occur as (1) buildups and small mound-like \n\nbuildups of variable dimensions, some up to 4-5 m high and several meters in length; (2) as \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 141\n\nrough hard-grounds that can pave the seafloor for several square meters, with a thin or \n\nabsent sediment cover; (3) as crusts and slabs, similar to the pavements or; (4) as nodular \n\nmasses of few cm size within superficial sediments. \n\nThe fluid escape structures from the Gulf of Cadiz (MV, MC, MDAC) and \n\nassociated chemosynthetic communities, exhibit different phases of activity. They can \n\nrepresent a mud-prone phase of mud breccia extrusion with the rapid emplacement of mud \n\nflows. They can locally consist of phases of moderate flux, dominated by water and gas \n\nthat can result in the accumulation of shallow gas hydrates, manifested by the cementation \n\nof the mud breccia sediments and the formation of other types of MDAC and by the \n\nsupport of chemosynthetic communities. Or they can consist of phases of reduced flux, \n\ndominated also by water and gas, which will result in further formation of MDAC and a \n\ndecrease of the chemosynthetic communities. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 142 \n\n \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 143\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 5.  Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the \nGulf of Cadiz: Characterization and formation model \n\n \n\n \n\n5.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nDuring the TTR11 (Leg 3), TTR12 (Leg 2), TTR14 (Leg 1), TTR15 (Leg 4) and \n\nTTR16 (Leg 2) cruises, the area south and southwest of the Guadalquivir Diapiric Ridge \n\n(GDR), the Formosa Ridge (FR) and channels of the outflow of the Mediterranean water \n\n(MO), were surveyed with seismics, side-scan sonar, underwater TV and sampling. This \n\narea is characterized by a very strong backscatter on the available side scan sonar images \n\nand a very irregular seafloor, with morphological and sedimentological features related to \n\nfluid escape, as well as sedimentary structures associated with the MO (Figure 5.2). As \n\ndescribed on the previous chapter, the GDR, the FR, on erosional features associated with \n\nthe MO on the Cadiz Channel, in the Pen Duick and the Vernadsky Ridges and on some \n\nmud volcanoes and mud diapirs located on the pathway of the MO (Iberico, Faro, \n\nHesperides, Student and Yuma) has been shown to be characterized by the presence of \n\nlarge fields of dolomite crusts and chimneys (Kenyon et al., 2002; Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2002; \n\nSomoza et al., 2002; D\u00edaz-del-R\u00edo et al., 2003; Kenyon et al., 2003; Pinheiro et al., 2003; \n\nPinheiro et al., 2004). Dense fields of dolomite chimneys and aragonite pavements were \n\nalso discovered during the TTR14 cruise on the main channel of the MO in front of the \n\nStrait of Gibraltar. The re-examination of samples collected during the much earlier (1976) \n\nHesperides cruise on the northern slope of the Guadalquivir Channel also showed the \n\npresence of similar dolomite chimneys. Aragonite and calcite crusts or pavements, typical \n\nfrom cold seeps, were also discovered and sampled, associated with the Pen Duick and the \n\nVernadsky Ridges, within the Cadiz Channel and associated with several mud volcanoes: \n\nJesus Baraza, Yuma, Ginsburg, Kid, Mercator, Fiuza, Darwin, Shouen, Adamastor, \n\nMeknes, Hesperides Faro and Porto (Figure 5.1). \n\n\n\nChapter 5.

The relationships between distinct geochemical environments and the \n\nresulting precipitated MDAC are investigated and a formation mechanism of the different \n\ncarbonate lithologies is proposed. \n\n \n\n5.2 Material and methods \n\n \n\nThe samples used in this study were collected by dredging and by TV controlled \n\ngrab, on the main channels of the MO (Guadalquivir and Cadiz Channels, and in the MO \n\nchannel in front of the Gibraltar Strait), on the GDR, on the FR, in the Pen Duick and the \n\nVernadsky Ridges; in the Jesus Baraza, Yuma, Ginsburg, Kid, Mercator, Adamastor, \n\nFiuza, Darwin, Shouen, Meknes, Faro, Hesperides and Porto mud volcanoes; and I the \n\nIberico mud cone (Figure 5.1 and Figure 5.2). \n\nMorphology and sizes of the authigenic carbonates were described on underwater \n\nvideo observations and on the retrieved samples. The petrography of the carbonates was \n\nexamined in polished slabs and thin sections by standard petrographic and \n\ncathodoluminescence techniques. \n\nScanning electron microscope (SEM) observations were carried out, coupled with \n\nenergy dispersive spectrometer X-ray elementary analysis (EDS), in fresh fractured \n\nsurfaces and in samples etched with HCl 1% during 1-4 minutes before the SEM \n\nobservations. \n\nBulk mineralogy and the relative abundance of different carbonate mineralogies in \n\neach sample were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on 134 powdered samples \n\n(Table 1). X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained using a Scintag X-ray diffractometer \n\nwith CuK? radiation (1.5405 \u00c5 wavelength); Scans were done from 5\u00ba to 60\u00ba 2? at \n\n0.02\u00ba/sec, using 40 kV accelerating voltage and 30 mA current. As the intensity of the \n\ndiffraction pattern of a mineral in a mixture is proportional to its concentration, estimates \n\nof the relative proportions of the minerals in a sample were made by measuring their \n\nrelative peak areas. Peak identification and minerals relative abundance estimation were \n\nperformed using the Scintag interpretation software and the MacDiff\u00ae software packages. \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and \nformation model \n\n 146 \n\nThe peak areas were measured for the main peaks of the carbonate minerals aragonite \n\n(3.40 \u00c5), calcite (&lt;8 mol% MgCO3, 3.036 to 3.012 \u00c5), high-Mg calcite (8 to 30 mol% \n\nMgCO3, 3.012 to 2.946 \u00c5), protodolomite (30 to 40 mol% MgCO3, 2.946 to 2.916 \u00c5) and \n\ndolomite (40 to 55 mol% MgCO3, 2.916 to 2.871 \u00c5). The Mg:Ca ratio of the carbonate \n\nminerals was calculated from the shift of the d-spacing of the (104) reflection peak of \n\ncalcite and dolomite from the stechoimetric peaks positions in the diffraction spectra \n\n(Goldsmith and Graf, 1958; Lumsden, 1979). \n\nSamples for carbon and oxygen stable isotopic analyses were prepared by reacting at \n\n90\u00b0C with 100% phosphoric acid on an automated carbonate device connected to a VG-\n\nPRISM mass spectrometer calibrated with NBS19, NBS 18 and NBS 20. The results are \n\nreported in the conventional ? \u2030-notation with reference to VPDB (Vienna Peedee \n\nBelemnite). Analytical reproducibility of the method, based on repeated standards is better \n\nthan \u00b10.1\u2030 for both carbon and oxygen. For temperature calculations of the dolomite \n\nsamples, dolomite ?18O values were corrected for the analytical offset of +1.63\u2030, \n\nconsequence of the unequal oxygen fractionation during the reaction to CO2 (Rosenbaum \n\nand Sheppard, 1986). \n\nSamples for 87Sr/86Sr were dissolved in 20 ml, 1.0 N ultra pure acid acetic, \n\ncentrifuged, and then decanted and evaporated dry. Then, they were re-dissolved in 20 ml \n\nof 5-N HNO3 and loaded into columns containing the AG8 50W BioRad Sr-specific resin. \n\nThe 87Sr/86Sr composition of the carbonates (Arag, Calc, Mg-Calc and Dol) was \n\ndetermined using a VG-Sector 54 Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometer. The analytical \n\nreproducibility of the method, based on repeated standards, is better than \u00b10.000060\u2030. \n\nThe carbonate and the organic carbon were determined using a LECO CHNS-932 \n\nelemental analyzer. Three replicates of powdered and homogenized bulk material (2 mg), \n\ncollected with a micro-drill, were analyzed per sub-sample. The same set of sub-samples \n\nwas later subjected to combustion for 8 h through a predefined stepwise increase in \n\ntemperature up to 400\u00baC, to remove organic carbon, and re-analyzed for inorganic carbon. \n\nThe organic carbon content (Corg) was determined by the difference between total carbon \n\nand the inorganic carbon concentration. Results are presented in weight percent (wt%). The \n\nrelative precision of repeated measurements of both samples and standards was 0.03 wt%. \n\nThe sample preparation procedure used for extraction and purification of the lipid \n\nbiomarkers is based on the method of Peckmann et al., (2004) and described in detail in \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 147\n\nMagalh\u00e3es et al., (2005). The freshly broken carbonate sample was decalcified (HCl 10%) \n\nand the dried residue was refluxed in 6% KOH in CH3OH (saponification reaction: 2 h). \n\nThe supernatant was decanted and the residue was repeatedly extracted by ultrasonication \n\nin CH2Cl2/CH3OH (3:1 v:v), until the solvent become colorless. Subsequently, the \n\ncombined supernatants were portioned in CH2Cl2 versus water (pH 2). The resulting total \n\nextract was dried and separated by column chromatography (Merck silica gel 60, 0.063-\n\n0.200 mm; i.d.: 15 mm, length: 35 mm) into fractions containing: (1) hydrocarbons (20 ml \n\nor 3 column volumes of n-hexane); (2) Esters/ketones (20 ml of n-hexane/CH2Cl2 2:1); (3) \n\nAlcoholes (20 ml of CH2Cl2/Aceton 9:1; (4) Fatty acids/Polars (20 ml of MeOH). The \n\nEsters/ketones and Alcoholes fractions were dried and derivatised using pyridine and \n\nBSTFA (2:1) at 70\u00baC (1 h). The polar fractions/Fatty acids were dried and \n\ntransesterificated with Boron-Trifluoride methanol and then with KCl + hexane. Internal \n\nstandard used for all fractions was Cholestane. A modification of the method, by doing a \n\nprevious extraction with CH2Cl2/CH3OH (3:1; v:v) prior to decalcification, revealed to be \n\nefficient in cleaning dirt peaks on the dolomite chimney samples. \n\nThe hydrocarbon fraction was examined by combined gas chromatography-mass \n\nspectrometry (GC-MS) using a Varian CP-3800 GC/Saturn 2000 MS EI-mode, 70 eV) \n\nequipped with a 30 m fused silica capillary column (CP-Sil 8 CB Low Bleed, 0.25 mm ID, \n\n0.25 \u00b5m film thickness). The carrier gas was He. The GC-temperature program used was: \n\ninjection at 80\u00baC, 5 min isothermal; from 80\u00baC to 310\u00baC at 4\u00baC min-1; 20 min isothermal. \n\nIdentification of the organic compounds was based on comparison of the mass spectra and \n\nof GC retention times with those of published data and of reference compounds. \n\nCoupled GC-combustion-isotope ratio MS (GC-C-IRMS) was conducted using a \n\nFinnigan DeltaPlusXL mass spectrometer equipped with a HP6890GC and CuO/Ni/Pt \n\ncombustion furnace operated at 940\u00baC. Samples were injected splitless (1 min) onto a 30-m \n\nfused silica column (DB5-MS, 0.32 mm i.d., 0.25 \u00b5m film thickness) using a Gerstel \n\nCooled Injection System (CIS4) programmed from 48\u00baC (0 min) to 310\u00baC (10 min) at 12\u00baC \n\nsec-1. Carrier gas was He. The GC temperature program was: 3 min at 80\u00baC; from 80\u00baC to \n\n310\u00baC at 4\u00baC min-1; 30 min at 310\u00baC. GC-C-IRMS precision was checked using a standard \n\nalkane mix (n-C15 to n-C29) with known isotopic composition. The stable carbon isotope \n\ncomposition is reported in the delta notation (?13C) vs. the VPDB Standard. \n\nSamples for XRD, Sr, total organic carbon, carbonate content, carbon and oxygen \n\n\n\nChapter 5.

In each one of these types, sub-types were defined. On the \n\ndolomite type the following sub-types were identified: Dolomite crusts (DCr); Dolomite \n\nChimneys (DCh); Nodules or irregular massive forms (Nod). On the aragonite build-up or \n\npavement type (AragPav) the following sub-types were defined: Lithified mud volcano \n\nmud breccia (LMb); Shell crusts (SCr); Intraformational breccias (IBr); Lithified fragments \n\nof dolomite chimneys (LDChy); Stromatolitic layers (Str) and Fossilised biofilms (Fbf). \n\n \n\n5.3.1.1 Dolomite chimneys (DChy) \n\nThe terminology dolomite \u201cchimney\u201d is used in this work with a descriptive sense, \n\nindicating samples with a pipe-like or a conduit-like morphology. It is not used with a \n\ngenetic connotation of the formation process in the water column as a resemblance with the \n\nhydrothermal vent chimneys. This term is preferred because it has always been used to \n\ndescribe such structures not only in the Gulf of Cadiz (Diaz-del-Rio et al., 2001; \n\nMagalh\u00e3es et al., 2002; Somoza et al., 2002; D\u00edaz-del-R\u00edo et al., 2003) but also in many \n\nother cold seepage areas (Kulm and Suess, 1990; Greinert et al., 2001). The terminology of \n\nchimney is adequate to these samples if the term is considered with the meaning of a fluid \n\nconduit. \n\nThe recovered dolomite chimneys (DChy) are composed of compact, in general \n\ntightly carbonate-cemented, medium light grey to light brown colour sandstone/mudstone. \n\nTheir shape is in general cylindrical or conical, exhibiting a wide range sizes from 10 to 70 \n\ncm in length and from 1 to 35 cm in diameter. During underwater video observations it \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 149\n\nwas possible to identify chimneys up to 4 m long and with a diameter up to 0.5 m. The \n\nmineralogy, as described in Table 5.1 and in more detail in section 5.3.3, is characterized \n\nby the presence of dolomite as the major constituent of the cement. \n\nBased on their morphologies, several subtypes of chimneys were defined: (1) tubular \n\n(single or with 2 or 3 parallel tubes cemented together), (2) conical, (3) doughnut shaped, \n\n(4) spiral and (5) branched (Figure 5.3). \n\nRelatively to the vent channel, some chimneys are completely filled, without any \n\nopen and clear channel, while others show an open and sometimes large (up to half of the \n\ntotal diameter, c.a. 15 cm) vent orifice(s) that has the same shape than the chimney \n\n(straight, tortuous, ramified or helical). In general, the chimneys completely filled exhibit \n\ngrowth concentric ring layers. The outer walls of most of the chimneys (as the inner wall in \n\nthe ones with an open channel) are iron oxide stained, with a dark red to dark brown \n\ncolour. The chimneys that do not show any signs of this iron coating exhibit a pale yellow \n\nto medium light grey colour. Colonisation of the chimneys by fixed benthic fauna, like \n\nincrusting sponges (Porifera), corals, bivalve shells or brachiopod clusters is common, \n\nespecially on the chimneys with the dark iron oxides coating. These samples are frequently \n\nnailed by scavenger burrows of 1 to 2 mm in diameter and several cm in length, forming \n\nsinusoidal holes coming from the sample exterior. No mollusc shells or fragment of \n\nheterotrophic organisms, intact or even corroded, are found cemented inside the chimneys. \n\nThis is the opposite of what is observed on aragonite pavement samples or as it has been \n\ndescribed on samples typical from active seeping sites e.g. Paull et al., (1992) and Sibuet \n\nand Olu (1998). \n\nThe presence of iron and manganese oxy-hydroxides is interpreted as resulting from \n\nsecondary oxidation of sulphur minerals (pyrite), occurring after exhumation of the \n\nsamples, when they were in contact with the seawater, or in the oxidation zone of the \n\nsediment column. This exhumation is probably the result of erosion and sediment removal \n\ndue to strong bottom water currents like the MO. This explains why some chimneys have \n\ndifferent characteristics in the upper and the lower parts. Some samples present a reddish \n\nto brownish coloured upper part with higher frequency of holes, scavenging features and \n\nbenthic fauna, more tightly cemented and more intensely coated with oxides, while the \n\nbottom part is less cohesive and less oxidized, as reflected by the more greyish colours. \n\nThis is interpreted as the result of a longer period of contact of the upper oxidized part of \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and \nformation model \n\n 150 \n\nthe sample with the seawater, during the progressive exhumation of the sample. Some \n\nsamples like the one presented in Figure 5.4C clearly present oxidation fronts of growing \n\nintensity of the oxidation to the external part of the chimney and to the interior open vent \n\nchannel. The internal material, not in contact to the exterior if less oxidized. This is \n\nindicating that the oxidation is a secondary process occurring with the change of the \n\ngeochemical environment, probably related to the exhumation of the sample. Around \n\nburrows or scavenger channels, that promote the circulation of seawater within the sample, \n\nit is also possible to see similar oxidation fronts. The chimneys composed of finer grain \n\nsize detrital fraction have lower porosity and lower permeability than the chimneys with a \n\ndetrital fraction of silt to sand size. All these silty to sandy chimneys present higher \n\noxidation intensities and only some scarce clayish chimneys are not oxidized. \n\nSingular pyrite framboids or small pyrite clusters are observed by SEM on the non-\n\noxidized dolomite chimneys, dolomite crusts and nodules. Pyrite is absent from the \n\nintensely oxidized samples. On the weak oxidized samples, pyrite, if observed, shows signs \n\nof oxidation forming rims of iron oxides (probably containing OH-groups). This is also \n\nvisible on thin sections as brownish stain that is reflected on the reddish to brownish colour \n\nof the hand samples. \n\nSome of the chimneys present a incipient layering perpendicularly to the vent \n\ndirection, that in some situations is shown by fractures or weakness zones that contribute to \n\nthe segmentation and division of the chimneys (if this segmentation is closely-spaced then \n\nthe chimneys present a doughnut-shape where the length of the chimney is very small \n\ncompared to the diameter). In other situations, the layering is revealed by a increasing of \n\nthe diameter of the chimney (forming nodular protuberances) or changes on the \n\ngranulometry of the detrital fraction (see Figure 5.4). In one sample, it was possible to \n\nconsider that an dolomite crust was being formed perpendicularly to the chimney conduit, \n\nas the result of cementation along a conduit that crossed perpendicularly a more permeable \n\nlayer and the fluid migration developed also along this layer and also promoting their \n\ncementation. \n\nThe helicoidally, curved and branched chimneys (Figure 5.3F and G) probably \n\ncorrespond to cemented borrow infills. \n\nBased on the morphology, mineralogy, petrography and geochemistry, the dolomite \n\nchimneys are interpreted as corresponding to cemented fluid conduits. Depending on the \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 151\n\nsediment properties and fluid flow rate, different regimes of fluid flow can be expected: (1) \n\nMigration trough diffusion, that is expected to occur in the sediments with a higher grain \n\nsize and that in general correspond to conduits with no open vent channels; (2) Migration \n\ntrough (hydraulic) fracturing, as migration of clusters, as a flow through a single channel or \n\nas a flow through a canalized network (St\u00f6hr et al., 2005). Burrows and other sedimentary \n\nstructures and heterogeneities can be preferential pathways for this plumbing system. This \n\nflux regime in finer sediments will preferably maintain an open vent channel. This is \n\nsupported by the observation that the chimneys with open vent channels are characterized \n\nby a finer detrital fraction. \n\n \n\n5.3.1.2 Dolomite crusts (DCr) \n\nDolomite crusts (DCr) have planar shapes, up to 5 cm thick and up to 44 cm long \n\n(Figure 5.3A), although larger specimens were identifiable on underwater observations. \n\nThey are generally covered by a dark red or dark brown coating of Mn/Fe oxy-hydroxides. \n\nColonization of the crusts by fixed benthic fauna is common and more intense on crusts \n\nwith more intense coating. The samples with more intense coating present scavenger \n\nburrows of 1 to 2 mm in diameter and several cm in length forming sinusoidal holes \n\ncoming from the sample exterior. \n\nThe dolomite crusts are composed of pale yellowish to light brown (indicating the \n\npresence of Mn/Fe oxy-hydroxides) fine-grained and tightly cemented carbonate \n\nsandstone/mudstone, very homogeneous with no internal structure. Present in general, low \n\nporosity, just microporous and absence of macroporous or internal channels. Shells or \n\nbiogenic components incorporated in the crust are absent (except for foraminifera and \n\ncocolitic tests). Based on the morphology, texture, mineralogy and geochemistry, the \n\ndolomite crusts are interpreted as cemented sedimentary layers. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5.

Illustration of the different types of vent channel. (A) open vent channel; (B) open vent channel \n\nexhibiting oxidation fronts spreading out from the exterior of the sample and from the interior open vent \n\nchannel and also from open holes of burrows, as the one illustrated where is possible to observe the oxidation \n\nfront spreading from this hole; (C) completely filled chimney sample exhibiting concentric grow layers; (D) \n\nchimney with 2 parallel vent channels that are jointed at a an intermediate length; (E) chimney with two \n\nparallel and open vent channels. \n\n \n\n5.3.1.3 Dolomite nodules (Nod) \n\nThis type corresponds to nodular, massive, round or irregular forms (Figure 5.3H), \n\ncomposed of compact sandstone/mudstone. The texture, colour, mineralogy and \n\npetrography of this type is similar to the chimneys, with light brown or grey colours, often \n\ncoated by dark brown Mn/Fe oxy-hydroxides. The presence of oxidation rims progressing \n\nfrom the exterior to the interior of the samples is frequently observed. These samples are \n\ncharacterized by a dense homogeneous matrix of terrigenous (detrital quartz, feldspar and \n\nclay minerals) and foraminifers, completely cemented by micrite to microsparite carbonate \n\ncomposed of mixtures of dolomite, calcite and high Mg-calcite. Like the chimneys they do \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and \nformation model \n\n 154 \n\nnot include mollusc shells or fragments of heterotrophic organisms as part of the \n\nconstituent material. The shells or organisms, when present, represent secondary \n\ncolonization of the surface of the samples by benthic fauna. The size of the collected \n\nsamples is up to 45 cm in diameter. \n\n \n\n5.3.1.4 Aragonite crusts and pavements (AragPav) \n\nAragonite crusts and pavements are porous, whitish, light brownish grey to dark grey \n\naragonite dominated carbonate. Their mineralogy is dominated by aragonite and calcite, \n\ncementing a detrital fraction of quartz, feldspars, clays, mud volcano mud breccia clasts, \n\nshell fragments, foraminifera and calcareous nannofossils. Aragonite crusts and pavements \n\npresent in general tabular shapes (as revealed by the retrieved samples and by the \n\nunderwater video observations) or irregular block like or build-up shapes. The samples \n\ncollected are up to 50 cm in thickness and up to 1 m in length. \n\nDifferent lithologic types of aragonite pavements were identified: (i) lithified mud \n\nvolcano breccias; (ii) shell crusts; (iii) intraformational breccias; (iv) lithified fragments of \n\ndolomite chimneys/crusts; (v) stromatolitic layers; (vi) fossilised biofilms. Several subtypes \n\ncan coexist at the same location and some times in the same sample. \n\n \n\n5.3.1.4.1 Lithified mud volcano breccias (LMb) \n\nLithified mud volcano breccias correspond to very porous, weak to moderated \n\ncarbonate-cemented mud volcano breccias (Figure 5.5A). The collected samples present, in \n\ngeneral, irregular block-like shapes, up to 50 cm in diameter. Most probably, the recovered \n\nshapes result from the fragmentation of the samples during the sampling process. \n\nUnderwater video observations have shown that they form pavements with several square \n\nmeters of rough seafloor (Figure 5.6B). \n\nThey present in general brownish colours, indicating a moderate oxidation \n\nenvironment, to dark grey or black colours, indicating a reduced environment. Some \n\nsamples present an sharp interface of those different oxidation environments, the top part \n\nof the sample presenting a brownish colour, interpreted as corresponding to the seawater \n\ndominated environment, while the deeper part has a dark grey colour corresponding to \n\nsubsurface anoxic sediment environment. \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 155\n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.5. Illustration of the different aragonite pavement types. (A) Lithified mud volcano mud breccias \n\n(LMb); (B) Shell crusts (SCr); (C) intraformational breccias (IBr); (D) Lithified clasts of dolomite chimneys \n\ncrusts fragments (LDChy); (E) Stromatolitic layers (SL). \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and \nformation model \n\n 156 \n\nAragonite pavement LMb are characterized by distinctive mud volcano breccia clasts \n\nwith up to 3 cm in diameter, sub-angular to very angular shapes, randomly oriented. These \n\nclasts are very similar to the ones that are characteristic of the mud breccia material \n\ncollected on the various mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz. \n\nLithified mud volcano breccias are in general cement-supported. The matrix is \n\ncomposed of the clayish mud breccia clasts, silt to sand-size quartz and feldspar grains, \n\ncoccolithids, radiolarians, diatoms and foraminifera skeletons, as well as detrital clay \n\nminerals. Singular pyrite crystals, or small clusters randomly distributed or arranged in \n\nshort lamina, are also present. The cement is fine grained granular (micrite to sparitic) in \n\ngenerally poly-mineralic: aragonite, calcite and high Mg-calcite. Some LMb samples \n\npresent stromatolitic layers of fibrous, botryoidal mono-mineralic cement (see section \n\n5.3.1.4.5) composed of microspar to sparite aragonite needles 10 to 40 \u00b5m across and up to \n\n1 mm in length with less or no impurities of the detrital sediment matrix that are described \n\nin more detail as stromatolithic layers. \n\nFrequent linear holes of tubular shape, with 2 to 8 mm in diameter, were interpreted \n\nas Pogonophora worm casts. Alternatively, the linear holes could also be interpreted as \n\nventing conduits along which fluid migration is focused and around which precipitation is \n\nenhanced. Live Pogonophora were retrieved with some of the LMb in sites of interpreted \n\nmore intense or recent venting activity, as revealed by the live chemoautotrophic \n\ncommunities. \n\n \n\n5.3.1.4.2 Shell crusts (SCr) \n\nShell crusts (Figure 5.5B) correspond to aragonite pavement samples with high \n\namount of bioclasts, mainly of Calyptogena sp., Solemyidae and Lucinoma, Acharax shells \n\nand Pogonophora tube worms, incorporated in the fine grained granular (micrite to micro-\n\nspar) mono-mineral (aragonite) or poly-phase (aragonite, calcite, Mg-calcite) cement. \n\nSessile organisms, like small corals, brachiopods and small sponges are also found \n\nattached, and some times incorporated into the crusts. Some of the Acharax shells are still \n\nenclosed by an intact periostracum indicating in situ cementation. Like on the LMb the SCr \n\nalso show tubular holes (2 to 8 mm in diameter) interpreted as Pogonophora worm casts or \n\nas venting conduits along which fluid migration is focused and where the authigenic-\n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 157\n\ncarbonate precipitation is enhanced. Incorporated Calyptogena, Acharax and open channels \n\nof Pogonophora casts indicate that the crust formation took place near or at the seafloor. \n\nShell crusts show different degrees of oxidation and different intensities of iron \n\noxides coating. They have brownish colours, indicating moderate oxidation, or grey to \n\nblack colours, indicating redox environment. Samples presenting a sharp interface between \n\nthese two different degrees of oxidation are also found, with a top part of the sample \n\npresenting a brownish colour and colonized by benthic organisms, interpreted as \n\ncorresponding to the seawater or oxic superficial sediment column. And with a deeper part \n\npresenting a dark grey colour with no signs of benthic organisms that is interpreted as \n\ncorresponding to anoxic sub-superficial sediment column. \n\nThe crusts are grain or cement-supported, moderated to very strongly cemented with \n\nlow to medium macro-porosity of irregular shaped and randomly interconnected open \n\ncracks and cavities up to 2 cm in diameter. Because this type presented the best densely \n\ncemented samples of all the different pavement types, the SCr correspond to the largest \n\nretrieved samples (up to 1 m in length and 40 cm thick). The underwater video \n\nobservations revealed that they can form pavements with rough surfaces littering the \n\nseafloor for several meters or forming buildups. \n\n \n\n5.3.1.4.3 Intraformational breccias (IBr) \n\nIntraformational breccias (Figure 5.5C) exhibit tabular crust morphologies that pave \n\nthe seafloor or form irregular shaped buildups at the seafloor. These breccias are \n\ninterpreted as sin-formational breccias, composed of chaotically oriented matrix-like \n\ncarbonate intra-clasts (up to 3 cm in size, interpreted as fragments from previous aragonite \n\npavements), bioturbation casts, rare shells and can also include poorly lithified mud breccia \n\nclasts typical of the lithified mud volcano breccia type. \n\nIntraformational breccias are in general clast-supported with clay and silt size \n\nterrigenous sediment, in general intensely cemented by randomly oriented fibrous sparitic \n\naragonite and/or fine grained granular poly-phase micrite to microspar aragonite, calcite \n\nand high Mg-calcite (this, more abundant in the intraclasts). They present medium to high \n\nporosity with abundant irregular shaped and randomly interconnected plumbing networks \n\nof mesopores, open cracks and cavities that lead to the pseudobrecciated collapse texture \n\nfor this sample type. This lithologic type is interpreted as sin-formational i.e. the fractures \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and \nformation model \n\n 158 \n\nand pore spaces were formed during the cementation and maintained open. Some \n\nmesopores present a cover with stromatolitic layers of botryoidal white aragonite cements. \n\nFramboidal pyrite sometime occurring as layers, parallel to the stromatolitic lamina, are an \n\nindicator of the formation in anoxic microenvironments. Some of the pyrite shows a \n\nsecondary oxidation phase indicating a change in environment. \n\nThis lithologic type is interpreted as indicating a superficial formation process. It can \n\nbe explained by mechanisms involving gas hydrate formation and decomposition. This \n\nlithology corresponds to the intraformational breccias, gas hydrate carbonates and \n\naragonite collapse breccias as defined by Bohrmann et al., (1998) and Greinert et al., \n\n(2001). The brecciation can also result from ascending fluids, bubbles and pressure build \n\nup, as a result of the accumulation of methane gas below the crust and subsequent violent \n\ngas escape, as described by Hovland et al. (1987) for MDAC in North Sea pockmarks. The \n\ngrowing of gas hydrate pieces or layers and subsequent decomposition produces large \n\nvolume expansion that can also produce sediment disruption at the seafloor and \n\nbrecciation, as described at the shallow seeps in the Cascadia Subduction zone Hydrate \n\nRidge (Bohrmann et al., 1998; Greinert et al., 2001; Greinert et al., 2002) and in the Gulf \n\nof Mexico (MacDonald et al., 2003). One other mechanism can explain this lithology. The \n\ngas hydrates form layers and veins along which the cementation by carbonates is \n\nprevented. When the gas hydrate free host sediment is cemented the hydrate-bearing parts \n\nwill build pores after the gas hydrate decomposition (that can occur in situ or during the \n\nsample recovery). \n\n \n\n5.3.1.4.4 Lithified fragments of dolomite chimneys/crusts (LDChy) \n\nLithified fragments of dolomite chimneys/crusts (LDChy) are clast supported \n\nbreccias with dolomite clasts that have petrographic, mineralogical and isotopic \n\ncharacteristics of the dolomite nodules, crusts and chimneys. Therefore, these clasts are \n\ninterpreted as fragments of dolomite chimneys (DChy) and crusts (DCr) that were \n\ncemented during secondary episodes of MDAC precipitation. The LDChy samples (Figure \n\n5.5D) were collected by dredging the flank of the Guadalquivir Channel. The recovered \n\nspecimens of this type consist on 3 fragments up to 12 cm in size, with irregular to sub \n\nrounded morphologies that are probably the result of the sampling operation by dredging. \n\nThe clasts present up to 7 cm in size and are strongly stained with iron oxides. They \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 159\n\npresent in general sub-round shapes that indicate significant transport of the clasts by deep \n\ncurrents along the step flank of the Cadiz MO Channel or it can be a consequence of their \n\noriginal nodular shape of concretion-like morphologies. The pebbles are cemented by a \n\nporous and weakly to moderated lithified poly-phase carbonate of microspar aragonite and \n\ncalcite. The cement has pale to light brown colours indicating variable degrees of \n\noxidation. \n\n \n\n5.3.1.4.5 Stromatolitic layers (SL) \n\nStromatolitic layers are present in all the different lithologic aragonite pavement \n\ntypes (with exception for the LDChy) but, on the studied samples, their occurrence is more \n\nfrequent on the intraformational breccias and on the lithified mud volcano breccias. It \n\ncorresponds to stromatolitic laminas of an almost pure fibrous aragonite phase that \n\nrecovers the internal surface of pore spaces, voids, tubular cavities and fractures (Figure \n\n5.5E) of AragPav samples. Theses stromatolitic layers, up to 10 mm in thickness, present \n\nan external smooth surface with domal, isopachous layers of aggregates and botryoidal \n\nrims of sparite fibrous aragonite needles that grow in the direction of the centre of the \n\ncavities. The undulated laminas pattern, similar to the cauliflower-like structures of the \n\nstromatolites, grow on top and, in general, parallel to the cavities surfaces, on top of the \n\nfine grained (micritic to microsparitic) aragonite and calcite cement of the LMb, SCr and \n\nIBr. Because this fabric occurs associated with structures interpreted as fossilised biofilms, \n\nthe SL formation is interpreted as induced by the encrustation of microbial mats. \n\nThe stromatolitic layers are similar to the ones reported by Greinert et al., (2002) \n\nexhibiting inverted stromatolitic grow direction when compared with the true stromatactis. \n\nHe emphasize that the stromatolites in methane-derived crusts grow in the direction of the \n\nsource of energy, protruding downwards from shallow sediment horizons. AOM proceeds \n\nbelow pre-existing carbonate crusts and is aggregating downwards. The stromatolitic \n\nlayers of the studied samples presents complex growth patterns. Along some cavities, the \n\nstromatolitic layers are growing in the direction of the centre of the cavity. When the shape \n\nof the pore (usually elongated pores up to 2x12 cm) of irregular to lenticular shape \n\nresemble the shape of the collected chunks of gas hydrates (from some mud volcanoes), \n\nthese pores can be interpreted as relicts of gas hydrate pieces, veins or cavities filed with \n\ngas or methane riche pore fluids. In some larger cavities the botryoidal aragonite layers \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and \nformation model \n\n 160 \n\naggregation occurs downward from the top of the cavity. In this situations the stromatolitic \n\nlayers are interpreted as representing the roof of the cavities where the methane is being \n\ntrapped, leading to a more intense AOM in this part of the cavity. So this fabric is expected \n\nto occur whenever the environmental conditions favours near surface gas hydrate \n\nformation/decomposition. \n\nThis fabric represents a second stage of mineralization of the aragonite pevements. \n\nThe micritic to microspar calcite, Mg-calcite and fine grained aragonite precipitates, \n\ncementing the clay rich detrital matrix before the later stage of the fibrous aragonite \n\nstromatolitic layers formation. \n\n \n\n5.3.1.4.6 Fossilised biofilms (Fbf) \n\nSEM and thin section observations of the aragonite pavements frequently show thin \n\nsheets and threads lying over and between the aragonite needles, sometimes evolving the \n\naragonite needles or at the transition between different stromatolitic layers. These \n\nstructures, are described and discussed in Chapter 8, are interpreted as fossilised microbial \n\nbiofilms and mucous biofilms, relicts of micro-organisms. They were found exclusively \n\nassociated with the stromatolitic layers, on top of the botryoidal aragonite layers or \n\nbetween different aragonite layers. \n\n \n\n5.3.2 Occurrence and Underwater observations \n\nSeep sites and authigenic carbonate deposits were initially assumed to be isolated \n\noccurrences in the Gulf of Cadiz. The increasing detail and survey coverage during the last \n\nyears allowed the recognition of various cold seeps and MDAC occurrences between 400 \n\nand 4000 m water depth, indicating that these features are far more common than \n\npreviously anticipated (Figure 5.1 and Figure 5.2). The evaluation of the distribution of \n\nseafloor fluid seepage indicators observed on underwater video profiles and during sample \n\nretrieval by video controlled grab, and their correlation with sediment samples and acoustic \n\ncharacteristics on the seismic profiles and side-scan sonar backscatter images, indicate that \n\nthe occurrence of the MDAC and the seep sites are in close relation with mud volcanoes, \n\nmud diapirs and probable deep routed faults. Such structures are the preferential pathways \n\nfor fluid circulation and escape. \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 161\n\n \n\n5.3.2.1 Dolomite crusts and chimneys \n\nDolomite chimneys, crusts and nodules occur as high density fields where they occur \n\nsome times very fragmented and lying on the seafloor (Figure 5.6A). It is rare to find \n\nchimneys in a vertical position, protruding from the sediments. On a video line in the \n\nCadiz MO Channel chimneys are reported to occur in situ and not completely extruded \n\nfrom the sedimentary formation where they formed (Chapter 9) and there it was possible to \n\nrecognize in some situations a sub-parallel orientation of some chimneys relative to the \n\nsedimentary layering while other chimneys clearly present a sub-vertical orientation also \n\nsupported by the apparent layering interpreted in some chimneys. The dolomite crusts, \n\nchimneys and nodule occurrences are restricted to areas characterized by moderated to \n\nstrong bottom currents. Those are considered to be able to produce active erosion of the \n\nsurrounding unconsolidated sediments within which the chimneys grew, inducing the \n\nexhumation of the chimneys and their consequent fallowing down and fragmentation. \n\nLarge colonies of sea urchins, Cnidaria (Hydrozoa and Anthozoa), Mollusca \n\n(Gastropoda and Bivalvia burrows), Annelida (Polychaeta), Arthropoda (Decapoda), \n\nBrachiopoda, Echinodermata (Crinoidea, Asteroidea, Ophiuroidea, Echinoidea and \n\nHolothuroidea) use the carbonates as a hard ground for fixation. Unambiguous \n\nchemosynthetic communities were not identified at sites of exclusive occurrence of \n\ndolomite chimneys, crusts and nodules. Chemosynthetic communities were identified only \n\nat sites characterized by the occurrence of the aragonite pavement types. At the \n\nHesperides, Faro and Student mud volcanoes, and off Gibraltar, occurrences of dolomite \n\nchimneys and aragonite pavements are found in close spatial proximity or simultaneously. \n\nHowever the observed field geometry relationships between the different MDAC indicate \n\nthat they had distinct formation periods. The morphologic and textural characteristics of \n\nthe aragonite pavement carbonates show indicators of a recent or present day formation \n\nwhile the dolomite carbonates, which occur as fragments and remobilized pieces, indicate \n\nolder formation episodes. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and \nformation model \n\n 162 \n\n5.3.2.2 Aragonite pavements \n\nThe aragonite pavements appear in the seafloor as buildups, some times with \n\ndimensions up to 2-4 m, or as rough hard-grounds (up to 50-80 cm thick) that can paving \n\nthe seafloor for areas of several square meters, with a thin or absent sediment cover (Figure \n\n5.6B). \n\nColonization of these pavements by benthic fauna is frequent. Aggregates of clam \n\nshells, probably most of them dead, were identified in several places. Live chemosynthetic \n\nfauna (Calyptogena, Acharax and Pogonofera tube worms) were identified and sampled in \n\nsmall areas and at sites where the venting activity is considered to be more recent or more \n\nintense. Small patches of probable bacterial mats were identified only at one location in the \n\nFaro mud volcano. They were not detected at the scales normally found in areas of intense \n\nand active seeps like in the Gulf of Mexico or in the East Mediterranean. This is \n\ninterpreted as indicating a present day state of low or inactive fluid venting at the seafloor. \n\nThis is also confirmed by the low to mid range microbial methane turnover and AOM \n\nactivity in the measured mud volcanoes from the Gulf of Cadiz (Niemann et al., 2006). \n\nGas bubbles and sites of active fluid migration were observed only at two locations in the \n\nMercator mud volcano crater, in areas of highly gas-saturated mud breccia. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.6.

Petrographic and XRD studies show that their mineralogical composition consists of \n\ndolomite, protodolomite, high-Mg calcite, calcite, quartz, feldspar and clays (Figure 5.8). \n\nThe detrital fraction corresponds to a fossiliferous matrix with abundant bioclasts of \n\nplanktonic foraminifera (globigerinoids), ostracods, pellets and silty terrigenous grains of \n\nquartz, calcite, feldspars and clays. Iron and manganese oxy-hydroxides are present in \n\nalmost all the samples, staining them with a variable brownish colour depending on the \n\ndegree of oxidation of the sample. On samples with low or no oxidation it is possible to \n\nrecognize, on thin section and SEM, singular pyrite framboids or small pyrite clusters with \n\noxidation rims of brownish iron oxides that probably contain OH-groups. \n\nThe degree of cementation corresponds to an almost complete infilling of the original \n\npore space and therefore, all the different dolomite types show low porosity with absence \n\nof mega-porous and scarce fractures or cracks. The contacts between cemented grains are \n\nirregular, ranging from complete to inter-grain pore spaces with dimensions, in general, \n\nlower than 10 \u00b5m, leaving little residual porosity. The cement is composed of micrite to \n\nmicro-sparite equigranular rhombohedric calcite, high-Mg calcite, protodolomite and \n\ndolomite with dimensions of less than 15 \u00b5m (Figure 8.4, Chapter 8). The texture varies \n\nfrom isolated rhombohedra and aggregates of interlocking subhedral to euhedral crystals \n\non a tight mosaic of interlocking subhedral crystals. The individual dolomite rhombohedra \n\nhave diameters in the range of 2-15 \u00b5m, sometimes exhibiting serrated crystal faces. The \n\ncontacts between detrital grains and the cement are dictated by the shape of the detrital \n\ngrain. The carbonates are not observed dissolving or replacing the detrital grains. \n\nNo significant zoning of the individual dolomite crystals, either by petrographic, \n\ncathodoluminescence or SEM-EDS was observed. The carbonate cement shows no \n\nluminescence in cathodoluminescence observations. Since no textural evidence of calcite \n\nreplacement by dolomite was observed, dolomite is considered to be primary authigenic \n\nmicritic cement. Detailed description on the petrography and SEM observation of the \n\ndolomite dominated carbonates is presented in Chapter 8, section 8.3.1.1. \n\n\n\nChapter 5.

Frequency histogram of the distribution of the d(104) values for calcites and dolomites of the \n\nstudied dolomite dominated samples. \n\n \n\nAfter correction of the diffraction peaks of calcite and dolomite in function of the \n\nmajor diffraction peak of quartz, it is possible to recognize that the major diffraction peak \n\nof calcite d(104) differs from those of stoichiometric calcite d(104) = 3.035 \u00c5. This shift \n\ncan result from the Ca2+ substitution by Mg2+ and/or Fe2+ and Mn2+ (Goldsmith and Graf, \n\n1958). EDS analyses performed during SEM observations indicate that, in general, only Ca \n\nand Mg were detected on the calcite and dolomite minerals. Fe was detected in some \n\nsamples, representing relative proportions of less then 10% of the total (Ca + Mg + Fe). \n\nThe Fe is most probably coming from the iron oxides. This is also supported by the \n\ncathodoluminescence microscopy observations that do not indicate the presence of \n\nsignificant amounts of Fe or Mn in the carbonate phases. Therefore, the shift of the d(104) \n\ndolomite diffraction peak is assumed to result from the Ca/Mg replacement. Estimates of \n\nthe Mg/Ca ratios are reported in Figure 5.7, based on the Goldsmith and Graf (1958) \n\nequation, with a maximum error of 9 mol MgCO3 % (Goldsmith and Graf, 1958). \n\n( )dmolMg ?\u00d7= 035.3)00298.0/1(%)(   (5.1) \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 167\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\nFr\n\neq\nue\n\nnc\ny\n\nA\nra\n\ngo\nni\n\nte\n\nC\nal\n\nci\nte\n\nM\ng-\n\nC\nal\n\nci\nte\n\nPr\not\n\nod\nol\n\nom\nite\n\nD\nol\n\nom\nite\n\nD\net\n\nri\nta\n\nl\n\nC\naC\n\nO\n3\n\nDolomite Crusts\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nFr\neq\n\nue\nnc\n\ny\n\nA\nra\n\ngo\nni\n\nte\n\nC\nal\n\nci\nte\n\nM\ng-\n\nC\nal\n\nci\nte\n\nPr\not\n\nod\nol\n\nom\nite\n\nD\nol\n\nom\nite\n\nD\net\n\nri\nta\n\nl\n\nC\naC\n\nO\n3\n\nDolomite Chimneys\n\n \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nFr\neq\n\nue\nnc\n\ny\n\nA\nra\n\ngo\nni\n\nte\n\nC\nal\n\nci\nte\n\nM\ng-\n\nC\nal\n\nci\nte\n\nPr\not\n\nod\nol\n\nom\nite\n\nD\nol\n\nom\nite\n\nD\net\n\nri\nta\n\nl\n\nC\naC\n\nO\n3\n\nDolomite Nodules\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nFr\neq\n\nue\nnc\n\ny\n\nA\nra\n\ngo\nni\n\nte\n\nC\nal\n\nci\nte\n\nM\ng-\n\nC\nal\n\nci\nte\n\nPr\not\n\nod\nol\n\nom\nite\n\nD\nol\n\nom\nite\n\nD\net\n\nri\nta\n\nl\n\nC\naC\n\nO\n3\n\nDolomite Samples\n\n \nFigure 5.8.

In some crusts and chimneys, dolomite \n\nforms the entire carbonate mineral fraction. The dolomite corresponds to fairly constant \n\nMgCO3 content between 45 and 47 mol%. The dolomite content in the sediment collected \n\nwithin the carbonate samples is lower and possibly corresponds, at least partially, to \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and \nformation model \n\n 168 \n\nfragments of carbonate samples incorporated in the surrounding sediments. Sediment \n\nsamples collected in the vicinity but out of the chimney fields show absence of dolomite. \n\nThis confirms the petrographic and XRD observations that dolomite is the predominant \n\nauthigenic mineral in the DCr, DChy and Nod samples. Protodolomite is present on the \n\nDChy and Nod samples (up to 32% wt%) with 30 to 37 mol% of MgCO3. Calcite and Mg-\n\ncalcite are the major constituents with up to 93% wt%. Calcite is the main carbonate \n\nmineral in the surrounding sediments and has a tendency to lower magnesium content on \n\ntheir lattice that in the calcite from the MDAC. \n\nThe detrital fraction, composed mainly of quartz, feldspars and clays, ranges from 5 \n\nto 92% wt% of the MDAC, with average values of 27, 33 and 34% wt% for Nod, DCr and \n\nDChy, respectively. In the surrounding sediments the non carbonate fraction corresponds \n\nto more than 50% wt% of the sediment. \n\nSEM observations (as described in more detail in Chapter 8) allowed the \n\nidentification of a high diversity of microbial induced fabrics such as: (1) microbial \n\nfilaments; (2) high Mg-calcite and dolomitic crystal aggregates that mimetize microbial \n\nfilaments through calcification, that these aggregates often incorporated in larger dolomite \n\nand calcite minerals; (3) carbonate rods with brush-like terminations; (4) carbonates with \n\ndumbbell-like and cauliflower structures (Figure 8.8 to 8.13, Chapter 8). Precipitation of \n\nsimilar crystal aggregates have been induced by bacterial activity in laboratory \n\nexperiments using sulphate-reducing bacteria (Vasconcelos et al., 1995; Warthmann et al., \n\n2000; Van Lith et al., 2003a; Van Lith et al., 2003b). These microbial filaments and \n\nstructures match the typical size of the microbial filaments and structures observed on \n\nSEM, indicating that those are clearly related to the precipitation of the carbonates and do \n\nnot correspond to any form of contamination. Therefore, and because of their low ?13C \n\nvalues, the structures observed on SEM are interpreted as representing an important \n\ninvolvement of microbial activity in the formation of the authigenic carbonate minerals. \n\n \n\n5.3.3.2 Aragonite crusts and pavements \n\nThe petrography and mineralogy of the different aragonite crusts and pavements \n\nhave common characteristics. The mineralogy is dominated by aragonite, with subordinate \n\ncalcite and high Mg-calcite. Aragonite pavement samples are characterized by the absence \n\nor by minor amounts of dolomite (less than 4% wt%), identified only on two of the 17 \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 169\n\nstudied samples. On shell fragments collected from a shell crust sample, dolomite was \n\ndetected by XRD on 3 samples, with values ranging from 9 to 26% wt% (Figure 5.11). \n\nTherefore, the detected dolomite on the cement of the aragonite pavement sample can \n\nderive from the shells or can have an authigenic origin. Quartz, feldspars and clay minerals \n\ncompose the detrital minerals of the host sediments, with amounts ranging from 6 to 39% \n\nwt% (Figure 5.10). It should be noted that the clastic fraction occurs in lower average \n\namounts on the stromatolitic layers (11% wt%). Aragonite is more abundant in the \n\ncarbonate samples than in the background sediment (6% wt%), confirming the \n\npetrographic observations that aragonite is the major authigenic mineral. \n\nPyrite was not detected on XRD but it was observed on thin sections and by SEM. \n\nPyrite occurs as individual spheres, framboids and small pyrite clusters forming incipient \n\nlayers or lineaments. In general, the pyrite is partially to almost completely oxidized to iron \n\noxides and/or hydroxides, that on thin section form brownish rims and stains. The detailed \n\nmineralogy of the iron oxides was not determined. \n\nThe aragonite pavements and crusts have a higher porosity when compared to the \n\ndolomite crusts, chimneys and nodules. The aragonite pavement samples present large \n\nmacro-porosity due to the large amount of voids, fractures, tubular and irregular cavities, \n\nsome of them interconnected, but they also have higher inter-granular pore spaces. \n\nOn the authigenic cements of the aragonite pavement samples two distinct texture \n\ntypes can be defined (Figure 8.17, Chapter 8): fine grained texture, and stromatolitic \n\nfibrous texture. These two textures differ in porosity, mineral content and crystal shape. \n\nThe fine grained granular texture (Figure 8.17, Chapter 8) is characteristic of the \n\ncement of the lithified mud volcano mud breccias (LMb), of the shell crusts (SCr), of the \n\nintraformational breccias (IBr) and of the lithified fragments of dolomite chimneys/crusts \n\n(LDChy). This texture is characterized by a complex poly-phase mineralogy of granular \n\nand fibrous aragonite, calcite and Mg-calcite crystals. Aragonite is the dominant mineral \n\nbut the relative proportion on the carbonate fraction is not as high as in the fibrous texture. \n\nThe detrital components (quarts, feldspars and clays) and siliceous/calcareous microfossils \n\nare present here in higher proportions than on the fibrous texture. The fine grained \n\naragonite and calcite ranges from micrite to microspar crystals. The detrital grains and \n\nclasts (of mud volcano mud breccia, fragments of dolomite chimneys, clasts of the \n\nintraformational breccias or shell fragments) are cemented and inter-grown by fibrous to \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and \nformation model \n\n 170 \n\ngranular aragonite, calcite and Mg-calcite, suggesting that the aragonite precipitated within \n\nunconsolidated and very weakly compacted sediments. Pyrite is also found in these texture, \n\nas individual framboids and small clusters, partially to almost completely oxidized and \n\ndispersed on the fine grained mass. \n\nStromatolitic texture (Figure 5.5F) is representative of the stromatolitic layers (SL), \n\ndescribed in section 5.3.1.4.5. It is characterized by up to 1.5 mm long fibrous aragonite \n\nneedles, typically occurring in layers or radiating aggregates or bundles that recover the \n\npore spaces, cavities and fracture walls in the different aragonite pavements. The \n\nstromatolitic texture in general does not completely fill the pore spares, voids, fractures \n\nand tubular cavities. As described in section 5.3.1.4.6 and in Chapter 8, these layers are \n\nalso characterized by the presence of microbial and mucous biofilms. The mineralogy is \n\ndominated by aragonite, with minor amounts of calcite and detrital fraction. Mg-calcite is \n\nabsent or occurs as minor component. From thin section observation it is possible to \n\nrecognise that the content of detrital grains in this texture is clearly less important or \n\nnegligible when compared to the fine grained texture. Pyrite is found, in general, as \n\nframboids or small clusters aligned parallel to the stromatolitic layers, partially to almost \n\ncompletely oxidized. \n\nThe fibrous texture represents a later stage of authigenic carbonate formation that \n\nclearly has grown over the previous fine grained granular texture. It has not been observed \n\nany situation where the stromatolitc texture has been overlain by the fine grained granular \n\ntexture. \n\nSEM observations revealed a high diversity of microbial induced fabrics, such as \n\nmicrobial filaments (Figure 8.23, Chapter 8), microbial and mucous biofilm sheets and \n\nthreads draped between aragonite needles (Figure 8.26, Chapter 8), aragonite batons, ball-\n\ncapped batons (0.20-0.70 \u00b5m) and nanograins. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 171\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nFr\neq\n\nue\nnc\n\ny\n\nA\nra\n\ngo\nni\n\nte\n\nC\nal\n\nci\nte\n\nM\ng-\n\nC\nal\n\nci\nte\n\nPr\not\n\nod\nol\n\nom\nite\n\nD\nol\n\nom\nite\n\nD\net\n\nri\nta\n\nl\n\nC\naC\n\nO\n3\n\nAragonite pevements\n\n \nFigure 5.9.

The variation \n\nof the strontium isotopic composition of seawater is well defined (Elderfield, 1986; Farrell \n\net al., 1995). Thus, strontium isotopes can be used to constrain the source of the fluids of \n\nauthigenic carbonates. \n\n \nTable 5.2.

Strontium isotope values of MDAC samples with reference to the present day seawater \n\nstrontium isotopic composition (Paytan et al., 1993). \n\n \n\nTo evaluate the source of the fluids at the cold seeps where MDAC are formed, their \n\nstrontium isotopic composition should be compared with the 87Sr/86Sr values of the pore \n\nwater in nearby sedimentary sections and with that of the venting fluids and of the pore \n\nwater from sites of active seepage. Unfortunately this data are not available for the Gulf of \n\nCadiz. The nearest DSDP sites (site 120 situated on the Gorringe Bank, site 135 located at \n\nthe Horseshoe Abyssal Plain and sites 544-547 at the Moroccan margin) represent different \n\ngeochemical environment, out of the accretionary complex setting. The available data of \n\npore water 87Sr/86Sr ratios, within the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary complex, are from the \n\nBonjardim, Ginsburg and Captain Arutyunov mud volcanoes (MVs), that significantly \n\ndiffer from present day seawater composition, indicate different fluid sources for the \n\ndifferent MVs (Hensen et al., in press). Assuming that all the studied MDAC are recent in \n\nage (Pleistocene) only nominal variations in the strontium isotopic composition of the \n\nauthigenic carbonates are to be expected if the carbonates have been formed at or very near \n\nthe Pleistocene seafloor water. If there is an addition of strontium from deep fluids with \n\ndifferent Sr isotopic compositions, as indicated from the analysed MV fluids (Hensen et \n\nal., in press) then it is expected that the authigenic carbonates should have Sr isotopic \n\ncompositions that differ from that of the present day seawater. If the source of Sr captured \n\nin the authigenic carbonates was carried by fluids moving upwards along deep faults, then \n\nthe 87Sr/86Sr values should reflect this deeper origin. The 87Sr/86Sr ratios for the different \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and \nformation model \n\n 178 \n\ntypes of carbonate samples (dolomite chimneys and crusts and aragonite pavements) show \n\nvalues between 0.709110 and 0.709191 (Table 5.2 and Figure 5.15). These 87Sr/86Sr ratios \n\nreflect the isotopic signature of the present day seawater of 0.709175 (Paytan et al., 1993), \n\nindicating that all the authigenic carbonates were formed from seawater with Sr values \n\nsimilar to those of the present day seawater. Thus the 87Sr/86Sr ratios of the analyses \n\nauthigenic carbonates do not indicate an addition of Sr from deep-seated fluids. \n\n \n\n5.3.7 Biomarker analyses \n\nSpecific 13C-depleted lipid biomarkers were identified in dolomitic chimney samples \n\n(Figure 5.16). These biomarkers include tail-to-tail linked acyclic isoprenoids such as 13C-\n\ndepleted PMI (2,6,10,15,19-pentamethyleicosane; ?13C-values of -117 and -144\u2030) and \n\nsqualane (2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyltetracosane; ?13C-values of -64 and -98\u2030). These \n\ncompounds derive from archaea involved in the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) \n\n(Peckmann and Thiel, 2004). \n\nThe aragonite crusts show better preserved biomarker patterns in comparison with \n\nthe dolomite chimneys. PMI (?13C value: ?101\u2030) are accompanied by unsaturated \n\nderivatives with 1 to 3 double bonds (PMI?; ?75\u2030). Isotopically-depleted PMI represents \n\nthe most widespread and persistent hydrocarbon biomarker for AOM-performing archaea \n\n(Peckmann and Thiel, 2004). Crocetane is present as one of the dominant peaks, strongly \n\ndepleted in 13C (-132.27\u2030). Crocetane:1, the monounsaturated version of crocetane, is also \n\npresent with a 13C ratio of -50\u2030. Squalane is present but not so depleted as in the previous \n\nbiomarkers.  \n\nThese results support the SEM observations, that indicate that the precipitation of the \n\nMDAC is microbially mediated, and show that Archaea have played an important role in \n\nthe carbonate authigenesis at methane-seeps in the Gulf of Cadiz. \n\nLipid biomarker analysis and interpretation is discussed in more detail in Chapter 8. \n\n \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 179\n\n \nFigure 5.16.

Diffusive transport of methane \n\nunder normal vertical compaction and in a region that is not characterized by a high ocean \n\nprimary productivity neither with high sedimentation rates, is not likely to produce large \n\namounts of light hydrocarbons to induce the precipitation of the authigenic carbonates. The \n\nGulf of Cadiz corresponds to an accretionary wedge subjected to tectonically induced \n\ncompaction, in addition to the normal gravitational loading (Gutscher et al., 2002; \n\nGutscher, 2004). The Gulf of Cadiz is also characterized by the occurrence of mud \n\nvolcanoes and mud diapirs that are tectonic controlled by deep structures (Pinheiro et al., \n\nin prep.). In these deformed sediments, the large-scale migration of fluids will be, most \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and \nformation model \n\n 180 \n\nprobably, conditioned and favoured along the fault zones, dipping permeable beds and \n\nalong the mud volcanoes and diapir conduits. The result of fluid advection along those \n\ndiscrete pathways will be localized at sites of abnormally high discharge. This is in \n\nagreement with the field relationships and with the geological distribution of the \n\noccurrences of the authigenic carbonates in the Gulf of Cadiz. The authigenic carbonates \n\noccur whether associated with mud volcanoes (Faro, Hesperides, Ginsburg, Mercator, \n\nAdamastor, Meknes, and Jesus Baraza), mud diapirs (Iberico, Cornide), fault scarps (Penn \n\nDuick escarpment) or along ridges (GDR, Formoza ridge). The occurrences along the \n\nGuadalquivir and Cadiz Channels, with the GDR and Formoza ridge, are probably, part of \n\nthe same tectonic system of trusts that correspond to the N limit of the accretionary wedge \n\n(Figure 5.1 and Figure 5.2). \n\n \n\n5.4.2 Estimation of fluids composition and evolution \n\n5.4.2.1 Estimation of Pore water composition \n\nThe carbon isotopic composition of the authigenic carbonates (?13C = -56.16\u2030 to -\n\n8.42\u2030 PDB, Figure 5.12) indicate that they originated from a moderate to extremely 13C-\n\ndepleted reservoir. For isotopic light carbon signature, two principal sources can be \n\nconsidered: (1) decomposition of organic mater, that result in typical pore waters ?13C \n\nvalues of about -25\u2030 PDB, and (2) methane (CH4) and higher hydrocarbons oxidation \n\nproducts (Rosenfeld and Silverman, 1959; Claypool and Kaplan, 1974). \n\nTwo potential sources of methane can be considered in the Gulf of Cadiz: \n\nthermogenic and biogenic. Typically, biogenic methane formed by CO2 reduction or by \n\nfermentative decomposition of organic matter by micro-organisms at shallow depths is \n\nextremely fractionated in 13C, typically with ?13C-values between -50\u2030 and -110\u2030 PDB \n\n(Claypool and Kaplan, 1974; Schoell, 1988). Thermogenic methane, in contrast, is isotopic \n\nless fractionated ranging from -50\u2030 to -20\u2030 PDB (Schoell, 1980, 1988). \n\nResults from organic geochemical study of gas saturated mud breccia gravity cores \n\nfrom the Porto, Bonjardim, Captain Arutyunov, and Ginsburg mud volcanoes (MV) show a \n\npredominantly thermogenic origin for the hydrocarbon gases (Nuzzo et al., 2005a, b; \n\nStadnitskaia et al., 2006; Hensen et al., in press), but suggest distinctive fluid-generating \n\nenvironments and different secondary processes during transport (e.g., deep hydrocarbon \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 181\n\noxidation and mixing with brines) for the different sectors of the Gulf of Cadiz. For Porto, \n\nBonjardim and Captain Arutyunov MVs the methane generation seems to be associated \n\nwith deep hydrothermal activity (Hensen et al., in press). While Ginsburg MV and other \n\nMVs in the Moroccan margin indicate conventional thermogenic origin. Observed values \n\nare: Bonjardim: ?13C-CH4 = -47 to -50\u2030 VPDB, C1/C2+ ~10; Ginsburg: ?13C-CH4 = -40 to \n\n-42\u2030 VPDB, C1/C2+ ~20 to 100; Captain Arutyunov: ?13C-CH4 = -42 to -52\u2030 VPDB, \n\nC1/C2+ ~1000 (Nuzzo et al., 2005a, b). The gas hydrate composition from the Ginsburg \n\nMV has methane to heavier hydrocarbons ratios (C1/C2-C6) up to 19% of C2+ and an \n\ninferred source of the gas in the hydrates enriched in C2-C6 (? 5%) indicating a \n\nthermogenic origin of the gas (Mazurenko et al., 2002). Therefore, the oxidation of higher \n\nhydrocarbons is another potential process that can occur and explain the observed data. \n\nDiagenetic turnover of organic matter, which produces ?13C pore water values of \n\napproximately -20\u2030 PDB, is another process that can have an influence on the carbon \n\nisotopic signature of the authigenic carbonates. The total organic carbon content (Corg) of \n\npelagic sediments collected at or near the sites where the authigenic carbonates where \n\ncollected from, shows values up to 0.88% (Figure 5.11). These values are in the range of \n\nthe normal values of Corg reported from this area and represent typical low to moderated \n\norganic contents of this low to medium productivity margin (Schonfeld, 2001). As such, \n\nthe Corg content of the pelagic sediments can generate microbial methane but, at the top \n\nsediments of the sedimentary column, the input from in situ organic matter oxidation to the \n\npore water total carbon pool is not expected to be major. \n\nDissolved carbon from normal seawater and HCO3- derived from dissolution of \n\ncarbonate tests, both with ?13C values ~0\u2030 (PDB) is another potential important source of \n\ncarbon to the total carbon pool from which the carbonates were precipitated. Given that the \n\nstrontium isotopic values indicated a seawater origin, it is to be expected that the seawater \n\ncan also be an important source for the carbon. \n\nThe inference of the isotopic composition of the carbon pool from the carbonate \n\nmineral isotopic composition is complex, because the mineral composition may reflect \n\nmixing from the different carbon sources. Fractionation of the carbon will also depend on \n\nthe extent to which the different carbon reservoirs are oxidized. However, it is possible to \n\nestimate the ?13C composition of the fluids from which the authigenic carbonates were \n\nprecipitated from. As many samples have ?13C values heavier than biogenic methane, \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and \nformation model \n\n 182 \n\nmixing with other carbon sources is apparently common. The average ?13C values of the \n\nauthigenic carbonates is very close to the average values of the gas hydrates and pore water \n\ngas composition collected from the mud volcanoes, that indicate in general a mixture of \n\nbiogenic and thermogenic gases. Thus, it is possible to estimate that the authigenic \n\ncarbonates most probably reflect a similar fluid composition. As such, the isotopic \n\ncomposition of the authigenic carbonates (Figure 5.12) reflects a major mixing of \n\nthermogenic and biogenic methane-rich fluids with non-methane carbon sources where \n\nmost probably, seawater is the most important. A mixing of different proportions of \n\nbiogenic and thermogenic methane is also to be considered, since this process is also \n\nobserved on the gas composition of different mud volcanoes. \n\n \n\n5.4.2.2 Anaerobic oxidation of methane and carbonate precipitation \n\n?13C values of the authigenic carbonates (Figure 5.12) are typical from carbonates \n\nformed at methane vents (Kulm et al., 1986; Hovland et al., 1987; Ritger et al., 1987; \n\nKulm and Suess, 1990; Paull et al., 1992; Bohrmann et al., 1998; Greinert et al., 2001; \n\nPeckmann et al., 2001a). \n\nThe textural relationship of the authigenic pyrite that is completely surrounded by the \n\ncarbonate cement indicates that they are syn-genetic. The authigenic pyrite requires that \n\nthe sediments were below the zone of oxic diagenesis. This implies anaerobic oxidation of \n\nmethane (AOM) via sulphate reduction (SR) also supported by the biomarker evidence of \n\nAOM and SR in dolomite chimneys and in aragonite pavements (Figure 5.16). \n\nDuring the upward migration the methane rich fluids, probably with minor amounts \n\nof reduced carbon-compounds, were anaerobically oxidized (AOM) in the Sulphate \n\nReduction Zone (SRZ), according to the microbially mediated (Boetius et al., 2000) net \n\nchemical reaction (Reeburgh, 1980): \n\n \n\nOHHSHCOSOCH 23\n2\n\n44 ++?+\n???   (5.2) \n\nAOM increases the alkalinity of the pore fluids and isotopic light methane carbon is \n\nconverted to bicarbonate and partly controls whether aragonite, Mg-calcite or dolomite \n\ncarbonates with light carbon isotopic ratio precipitates (Ritger et al., 1987; Paull et al., \n\n1992). Sulphide is another product of coupling AOM + SR and accumulates in \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 183\n\nconcentrations equivalent to those of sulphate consumption. The sulphide produced will be \n\nprecipitated as pyrite, dissolved in the seawater and an important amount will be consumed \n\nby sulphide-based communities such as Siboglinum sp., Polybrachia and Oligograchia \n\n(pogonophora), Acharax sp. (solemydae) and Lucinoma (Lucinidae) that were collected at \n\nthe most active sites where authigenic carbonates were collected (Rodrigues and Cunha, \n\n2005). \n\nDuring the upward fluid migration, if sulphate is available at depth, it will promote \n\nmethane oxidation and the pore waters which migrated from the zone of methanogenesis \n\ntowards the seafloor can already contain substantial amounts of methane-derived CO3 upon \n\narrival at the top of the sediment column. The intense upward migration of methane (as gas \n\nor fluid) will move up the SRZ to close or, in extreme fluxes, to the seafloor. At the more \n\nactive mud volcanoes (Bonjardim, Ginsburg, Gemini and Captain Arutyunov) the SMTZ \n\nlies at depths ranging between 20 and 200 cm bellow seafloor (Niemann et al., 2006; \n\nHensen et al., in press). Similar SMTZ depths are characteristic of the more active sites \n\nfrom where authigenic carbonates where collected. \n\n \n\n5.4.3 Carbonate mineralogy and geochemical environments \n\nPetrographic estimation of pre-cementation porosities suggests that the carbonate \n\nprecipitation occurs near or very near the top of the sediment column. Carbonate \n\nprecipitation and dissolution is influenced by the concentration of the cations Ca2+ and \n\nMg2+ (Fe2+, Mn2+), the complex-forming anions SO42- and temperature (Burton, 1993; \n\nMorse et al., 1997). These factors determine the development of the authigenic carbonates, \n\ntheir mineralogy and their isotopic signature. Hence, the different carbonate lithologies \n\nrecord distinct environments of formation. \n\nCalcium and magnesium occur in sufficient amounts in the pore waters of the \n\nuppermost sediments to induce precipitation. The absence of a systematic and deeper pore \n\nwater samples, and the scarceness of long gravity cores at the more active sites, make it \n\ndifficult to assess the role of calcium and magnesium in the formation of the authigenic \n\ncarbonates and to constrain the depth of the more active precipitation zone. The available \n\ndata (Hensen et al., in press) indicate a wide and variable depth of Ca-Mg depletion, that is \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and \nformation model \n\n 184 \n\nstrongly associated with the methane and sulphate gradients. The Ca-Mg profiles seem to \n\nreflect the depth of the SMTZ zone. \n\nThe mineralogy of the authigenic carbonates is widely variable, and consists of \n\ndolomite, protodolomite, Mg-calcite and calcite in the dolomite crusts, nodules and \n\nchimneys (Figure 5.7), and aragonite, calcite and Mg-calcite in the aragonite pavements. \n\nThere is a clear distinction between the two main morphologic types of samples: the \n\ndolomite-dominated mineralogy of the crusts, chimneys and nodules, and the aragonite-\n\ndominated mineralogy of the pavements. All the methane-derived authigenic carbonates \n\nare formed from diagenetic fluids that are, most probably, super-saturated with respect to \n\nall the carbonates phases that are found. Therefore the different mineralogies will be \n\ndetermined by the differences in mineral growth rate and the minor differences in the \n\ngeochemical conditions that will favour one mineralogy in detriment of the other. \n\n \n\n5.4.3.1 Dolomite \n\nMagnesium that in seawater is supersaturated for dolomite precipitation forms ion-\n\ncomplex MgSO40, even at very low SO42- concentrations (Baker and Kastner, 1981). \n\nTherefore, SO42- is an effective inhibitor for dolomite precipitation, even at concentrations \n\nless than 5% of its value in seawater, which is the ultimate source of SO42- for marine \n\nsediments. At methane seeps, where there is an efficient system of migration of sulphate-\n\ndeficient and methane-enriched deep fluids, the SMTZ will be pulled upward and, \n\naccording to equation (5.2), the seawater sulphate will be gradually consumed. As a result, \n\nthe amount of MgSO40 decreases and free Mg ion increases, the Mg/Ca ratio increases and \n\ndolomite is preferentially precipitated (Baker and Kastner, 1981). According to equation \n\n(5.2), AOM also contributes to a higher CO3 super-saturation, that favours the \n\nincorporation of greater amounts of MgCO3 (Mackenzie et al., 1983). In semi-closed \n\nsystems, such as burrows, and along the methane-rich fluid migration conduits and \n\npathways, the sulphate depletion should reach maximum values and those should be places \n\nof preferential dolomite precipitation. \n\nThe existence of pyrite provides evidence for an anoxic pore water environment. The \n\npresence of pyrite in the non-oxidized dolomite chimneys, dolomite crusts and nodules and \n\nits absence in the oxidized samples is not interpreted as lack of pyrite formation during the \n\ncementation of the chimneys. It is interpreted instead as the result of pyrite oxidation and \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 185\n\ndegradation to iron oxy-hydroxides after exhumation of the samples from the sediment. \n\nThe higher oxidation intensities of the samples will indicate longer periods of permanence \n\nat the seafloor. This is also supported by the biomarker analyses that show a better \n\npreservation of organic compounds in the samples with lower oxidation intensities. \n\nIn conclusion, dolomite precipitation occurs at the sulphate-methane transition zone \n\n(SMTZ), preferably within semi-closed systems, such as the fluid conduits. Biomarker and \n\nSEM observations indicate that the microbial activity have and important role on the \n\ndolomite formation. \n\n \n\n5.4.3.2 Aragonite \n\nAragonite formation is favoured over calcite in more aerobic environments, with \n\nhigh SO42- concentrations and high Mg/Ca ratios, like in typical seawater values (Burton, \n\n1993), and at low phosphate concentration and low organic matter oxidation (Burton and \n\nWalter, 1990). As such, on a more open system, like in environments very close to the \n\nseafloor, aragonite is preferentially formed. The precipitation of aragonite instead of calcite \n\nis favoured in seawater, as a result of the inhibiting effect of the hydrated Mg ions on the \n\ncalcite structure. These environmental conditions should be met at or very close to the \n\nseafloor, when more intense and diffuse methane flux will move the SMTZ very close to \n\nthe seafloor and the seeping methane-charged pore waters will meet bottom waters, and \n\nwhen SR coupled with AOM keep the rates of organic matter oxidation and phosphate \n\nproduction low. Therefore, the aragonite pavement samples that present a mineralogy \n\ndominated by aragonite, should have been formed in such a geochemical environment. \n\n \n\n5.4.3.3 Calcite and Mg-calcite  \n\nThe calcite d(104) values show a poly-modal distribution revealing the existence of \n\ndifferent calcite sources: a low Mg-calcite, of biogenic origin, with d(104) values centred \n\naround 3.028 \u00c5, and high Mg-calcites with d(104) values centred at 3.000 and 2.980 \u00c5 \n\n(Figure 5.7). \n\nThe high Mg-calcite precipitation will be promoted in environments not so \n\ninfluenciated by the seawater such as those that promote the aragonite precipitation, and \n\nnot in closed systems where dolomite is favoured. \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and \nformation model \n\n 186 \n\n \n\n5.4.4 Biogeochemistry - the microbial factor \n\nAlthough the exact biochemical pathway of AOM still remains unclear, molecular, \n\nisotopic and phylogenetic evidence revealed that AOM is performed by a consortium of \n\nmethanotrophic archaea and sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) (Peckmann et al., 1999; \n\nBoetius et al., 2000; Elvert et al., 2000; Peckmann et al., 2001a; Peckmann et al., 2001b). \n\nTherefore, this microbial activity has an active and important role on the definition o the \n\nbio-geochemical conditions that will lead to the precipitation of the authigenic carbonates. \n\nThe presence of the AOM-SR consortium is revealed by the biomarkers present in the \n\nauthigenic carbonates. These biomarkers have been identified on both aragonite pavements \n\nand dolomite chimneys. \n\nIn aragonite pavements the identification of microbial and mucous biofilms is \n\nfrequent, occurring as a coating, draped between the aragonite fibres and needles of the \n\nstromatolitic layers. Also, aragonite batons, ball-capped batons and nanograins are \n\nobserved. This indicates that microbial activity has played an important role in the micro-\n\nenvironmental conditions and most probably also on the formation of the authigenic \n\ncarbonate minerals (Figure 8.23, Chapter 8). \n\nIn the cement of the dolomite crusts, nodules and chimneys, which consists of minor \n\naggregates of rhombohedric calcite, high-Mg calcite and dolomite, up to 15 \u00b5m in \n\ndiameter, SEM observations allowed the identification of a large variety of microbial-\n\ninduced fabrics, such as: (1) microbial filaments; (2) high Mg-calcite and dolomite crystal \n\naggregates calcifying and mimetizing filaments and flattening themselves against dolomite \n\nand calcite minerals; (3) rods with brush-like terminations; (4) dumbbell-like and \n\ncauliflower structures (Figure 8.8 to 8.13, Chapter 8). Precipitation of similar crystal \n\naggregates have been induced by bacterial activity in laboratory experiments using \n\nsulphate-reducing bacteria (Vasconcelos et al., 1995; Warthmann et al., 2000; Van Lith et \n\nal., 2003a; Van Lith et al., 2003b). The observed microbial filaments and structures in \n\nthese aggregates match the typical size of the described features in the authigenic \n\ncarbonates and are clearly constructive in origin. The filaments that are covered by the 50 \n\nnm to 1 \u00b5m size rhombohedra of Mg-calcite or dolomite and that are being incorporated by \n\nlarger 10-15\u00b5m dolomite rhombohedra, can be interpreted as corresponding to nucleation \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 187\n\npoints from where the dolomite precipitation started and from which it progressed. So, the \n\norganogenic dolomite formation model, proposed for dolomite formation in shallow \n\ncoastal lagunall and shallow marine environments (Vasconcelos et al., 1995; Vasconcelos \n\nand McKenzie, 1997; Wright, 2000; Warthmann et al., 2005), or in organic rich and deep \n\nmarine sediments (Meister, 2005), is also proposed on the formation of these MDAC. The \n\nSEM observations and the biomarker analysis show that microbes are an active key factor \n\ninvolved on the dolomite precipitation. They most probably promote the adequate \n\ngeochemical conditions, creating optimal micro-environmental conditions, most probably \n\naround the microbial structures, from where the precipitation of the MDAC will be \n\ninitiated. \n\n \n\n5.4.5 Formation of the different MDAC lithologies \n\n5.4.5.1 Isotopic zonation \n\nThe carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios of the dolomite chimneys show a wide bud \n\nregular pattern (Figure 5.13 and Figure 5.14). Along radial profiles across the chimneys, \n\nthe carbon isotopic ratios become, in general, heavy towards the periphery and whereas the \n\noxygen isotopic ratios become lighter. This variation suggests temperature and/or pore \n\nfluid isotopic composition variations, reflecting the existence of changes in the sources of \n\nthe fluid venting during the formation of the chimneys. Large chimneys have, in general, \n\nlighter carbon isotopic ratios than thinner chimneys. \n\n \n\n5.4.5.2 Formation of dolomite crusts, chimneys and nodules \n\nConsidering the underwater video observations, the morphologic, mineralogic and \n\ntextural characteristics, it is possible to propose that the dolomite chimneys were most \n\nprobably formed in the sediments bellow the seafloor and were gradually exposed by the \n\nerosion of the surrounding layers of unconsolidated sediments. In Figure 5.17 is \n\nrepresented a schematic model for the formation of the different MDAC. As they loose \n\nsustentation they will fall down on the seafloor. The oxidation and the iron and manganese \n\ncoating, as well as the colonization by the benthic fauna, begin after the chimneys are \n\ncropped out. The dolomite chimneys with the more intense oxidation reveal a longer time \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and \nformation model \n\n 188 \n\nof exposure to the seawater and correspond to samples exhumed from shallower depths in \n\nthe sediment column. In contrast, the dolomite chimneys without or with only weak \n\noxidation signs have a shorter period of exposure to the seawater and correspond to a \n\nformation deeper inside the sediment column. The Mediterranean Outflow (MO) appears \n\nto have an effective control on the areas of occurrence of the different types of authigenic \n\ncarbonates. Dolomite crusts, nodules and chimneys occur in places where the MO has a \n\nstrong erosive effect (Figure 5.2). \n\nIf the dolomite chimneys and crusts had formed above the seafloor, by upward \n\ngrowth of carbonates (analogous to the sulphide chimneys on hydrothermal vents) they \n\nshould contain a very small detrital fraction that should be limited to the fine grained \n\nhemipelagic sediments. Moreover, they should not contain a similar detrital composition \n\nand a similar fabric to those of the surrounding pelagic sediments. \n\nBased on the morphology, mineralogy, petrography and geochemistry, the dolomite \n\ncrusts correspond to cemented sedimentary layers while the dolomite chimneys correspond \n\nto cemented fluid conduits. The dolomite chimneys are the result of expulsion of methane \n\nrich cold seep fluids along pathways of fluid escape formed by (hydraulic) fracturing or \n\nalong sedimentary discontinuities such as borrows. The large variability of shapes of the \n\nchimneys (helicoidal, parallel and branched) suggests a complex plumbing system and \n\npathways for the fluid percolation. In some situations, the fluid percolates upwards, cutting \n\nthe sedimentary layers (dolomite chimneys with variable diameter) while in other cases the \n\nfluid also percolates horizontally along more permeable layers, tending to form the slab-\n\nlike crusts and branched chimneys. Some of the chimneys type can also result from \n\nhorizontal flow along the conduits. When the fluid conduit crosses layers of different \n\npermeability (like layers of more sandy material), the penetration of the seeping fluid will \n\nincrease and the chimney will develop nodules, mushroom-like or even crust like shapes. \n\nThe low cement porosity of the dolomite crusts, chimneys and nodular types \n\ncompared to the aragonite pavements suggest that the cementation took place at a deeper \n\nlevel in the sediment column, most probably at the SMTZ, where AOM coupled with the \n\nSR is more intense. The formation of the aragonite pavements, with higher porosity, will \n\nmost probably occur at the seafloor or very close to the seafloor. \n\nIt is proposed that the fluid with 13C depleted methane migrated laterally through a \n\ncentred vent hole. Concentric precipitation of authigenic dolomite occurred by mixing of \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 189\n\nthe fluid penetrating radially outward from the vent hole with the ambient pore water (that \n\nthe 87Sr/86Sr values indicate to be present day seawater) in the surrounding sediments of the \n\nSRZ. Therefore, the carbon isotopic ratios of dolomite become progressively heavier with \n\nincreasing distance from the vent hole. The same explanation applies to the oxygen \n\nisotopic ratios, with the heavy oxygen being supplied by the fluid and the lither oxygen by \n\nthe pore water fluids. Similarly, the large chimneys present the lightest carbon isotope \n\nratios whereas  the thinner chimneys have heavier values. When the cold seep flux is high, \n\nthe power of the fluid penetration is also stronger and the isotopic dilution effect by the \n\npore water will be weaker, for sediments with the same permeability. Therefore, large \n\nchimneys may have been formed with stronger cold seep flux than the thinner chimneys. \n\nSeafloor\n\nS\nul\n\nfa\nte\n\nre\ndu\n\nct\nio\n\nn \nzo\n\nne\nM\n\net\nha\n\nno\nge\n\nni\nc\n\nzo\nne\n\nCH2O --> CO2 +  CH4\nbiogenic (? 13C > -90\u2030)\n\nCH4\ntermogenic (? 13C -20 a -30\u2030)\n\nsulfate reduction\nanaerobic\n\nmethane oxidation\nCH4 + SO42- -> HCO3- + HS- + H2O\n\nHCO3- microbial\nactivity\n\nMOW\n\nremobilized sediments\n\nSO42-\n\nPyrite\n\nFault\n\nOxidation\nzone\n\nSO42-\n\nHS-\nCalcite\n\nDolomite\n\nchimney\n\ncrust\n\nproduction of\nbiogenic methane:\n\nH\n2O\n\n (?\n18\n\nO\n +\n\n3\u2030\n)\n\nG\nas\n\n H\nyd\n\nra\nte\n\ns\n\nCalcite\n\nAragoniteSeafloor\n\nS\nul\n\nfa\nte\n\nre\ndu\n\nct\nio\n\nn \nzo\n\nne\nM\n\net\nha\n\nno\nge\n\nni\nc\n\nzo\nne\n\nCH2O --> CO2 +  CH4\nbiogenic (? 13C > -90\u2030)\n\nCH4\ntermogenic (? 13C -20 a -30\u2030)\n\nsulfate reduction\nanaerobic\n\nmethane oxidation\n\nsulfate reduction\nanaerobic\n\nmethane oxidation\nCH4 + SO42- -> HCO3- + HS- + H2O\n\nHCO3- microbial\nactivity\n\nmicrobial\nactivity\n\nMOW\n\nremobilized sediments\n\nSO42-\n\nPyrite\n\nFault\n\nOxidation\nzone\n\nSO42-\n\nHS-\nCalcite\n\nDolomite\n\nCalciteCalcite\n\nDolomiteDolomite\n\nchimney\n\ncrust\n\nproduction of\nbiogenic methane:\n\nH\n2O\n\n (?\n18\n\nO\n +\n\n3\u2030\n)\n\nG\nas\n\n H\nyd\n\nra\nte\n\ns\n\nCalcite\n\nAragonite\n\n \nFigure 5.17.

Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and \nformation model \n\n 190 \n\nconcentric rings can reflect different episodes of venting with different intensities and \n\ndifferent fluid compositions, or mixing fronts between the methane rich fluid and the \n\nseawater pore water. \n\n \n\n5.4.5.3 Formation of the aragonite pavements \n\nThe incorporation of Calyptogena sp., Acharax sp., open channels of Pogonophora \n\ncasts and the high porosity of the aragonite pavements indicate a formation near or at the \n\nsediment surface. Shell crusts indicate in situ cementation of, most probably, live \n\nchemosynthetic communities. Seafloor observations also support this as they show that \n\nseep sites are characterized by rough surfaces with crusts and slabs, forming pavements \n\nand buildups of cemented sediment. These pavements and buildups in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\nare observed associated with mud volcanoes, with the exception of the occurrences \n\nassociated with the Pen Duick and Vernadski escarpments and in places on MO channels. \n\nField relationships from seafloor video observations show that they are in general \n\nrelated to methane venting at discrete portions of the mud edifice. They are found in places \n\nwhere fluid escape to the bottom water or to the top sediments, very close to the sediment-\n\nseawater interface, occurs or has probably occurred recently. These higher fluxes can fuel \n\nmethane and sulphide chemosynthetic communities. At these sites, under anoxic but more \n\nintensely seawater ventilated environmental conditions, with higher sulphate \n\nconcentrations, authigenic precipitation is dominated by aragonite and calcite. These can \n\nbe the environmental conditions where shell crusts, lithified mud breccias (LMb) and \n\nintraformational breccias are formed (Figure 5.17). \n\nAn alternative hypothesis can be proposed to explain the vast extensions of the \n\naragonite pavements of the LMb type, which does not involve active fluid venting in vast \n\nextensions. Both mechanisms are compatible and probably may correspond to different \n\ntime episodes of the evolution of a seep system. After a mud volcano eruption, mud will be \n\nextruded producing flows that cover part or all the crater and eventually flow down the \n\nmud volcano flanks as a debris flows. This process produces reduced or insignificant \n\nmixing of bottom waters with the freshly emplaced mud breccia methane rich fluid, \n\nsulphate and oxygen depleted pore waters. After emplacement of the mud flow, methane \n\noxidation will occur at the sediment-water interface and the oxidation front will progress \n\ndownward according to the rates of methane flux due to the mud breccia compaction and \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 191\n\nthe downward diffusion of dissolved SO42- and O2. This diffusion of SO42- and O2 is \n\ncontrolled not only by the chemical gradients but also by bioturbation and biologic activity. \n\nThis process can result in the cementation of the mud volcano breccia, forming crust-like \n\nshaped LMb that pave extensive areas of mud volcano breccia flows. \n\nThe temporal alternation of active fluid venting and pore water methane-enriched \n\nmud flow emplacement can explain the breccification texture of the different aragonite \n\npavement types. It can also explain the secondary precipitation episodes that characterize \n\nthe stromatolitic layers. Gas hydrate formation/destabilization at shallow depths is also a \n\nprocess that is probably involved during high methane flux episodes and that can cause the \n\nbreccification of the carbonate crusts. \n\nThe zonation represented by the different stages of cementation that characterize the \n\nformation of the stromatolitic layers can alternatively be caused by precipitation at \n\ndifferent depths below the seafloor and/or in different geochemical microenvironments. \n\nThe extrusive activity of the mud volcanoes can result on a vertical migration of MDAC \n\nformed at deeper environments that were brought close to or at the seafloor by mud breccia \n\nexpulsions. This process can explain the lithified fragments of dolomite chimneys/crusts \n\n(LDChy), where dolomite mineralogy formed at confined environments, most probably at \n\ndepth, at the SMTZ, was brought to the seafloor (by mud volcano activity or by erosion of \n\nthe unconsolidated soft sediments) and later these fragments were re-cemented at shallow \n\ndepths close or at the seafloor by aragonite precipitation. So, the LDChy correspond to two \n\ndistinct time episodes of formation of MDAC in distinct geochemical environments. \n\nThe presence of small amounts of dolomite in one aragonite pavement sample can \n\nindicate that the sulphate depleted environmental conditions (SMTZ) that promote \n\ndolomite formation can be reached at a micro-environment scale conditions within the pore \n\nspaces, even in a near surface environment. Considering that the dolomite formation is a \n\nprocess that is mediated by microbial processes, this mediation will not biologically \n\ncontrol the precipitation process, but preferentially biologically induce the alteration of the \n\nmicroenvironment surrounding the bacteria cells (Vasconcelos et al., 2005), creating the \n\noptimal conditions for dolomite precipitation. These could result in the precipitation of \n\ndolomite in restricted microenvironments in an environment that is more propitious to the \n\nprecipitation of aragonite. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and \nformation model \n\n 192 \n\n5.5 Conclusions \n\n \n\nMDAC from the Gulf of Cadiz occur in two main carbonate types: dolomite crusts \n\nnodules and chimneys; and aragonite pavements. All dolomite crusts nodules and \n\nchimneys are composed of dolomite, protodolomite, high Mg-calcite and calcite, while the \n\npavements are composed of aragonite high Mg-calcite and calcite. \n\nThermogenic and microbial methane produced by microbial fermentation of organic \n\nmatter forms methane gas and hydrate layers or nodules under the seafloor, where \n\nconditions are adequate. When pressure or temperature change, gas hydrates dissociates \n\nrealising methane rich fluids with light carbon and heavy oxygen isotopic ratios. This \n\nmethane reacts with sulphate at the Sulphate-Methane Transition Zone (SMTZ), through a \n\nprocess that is mediated by microbial activity, by a consortium of archaea and sulphate \n\nreducing bacteria, as described by Boetius et al. (2000), which is confirmed by the \n\nbiomarker analyses. \n\nAs result of the AOM-SR net reaction (equation 2) the alkalinity is increased with \n\nlight carbon isotopic ratios, the sulphate is consumed and carbonate precipitation is \n\ninduced (aragonite, calcite, high-Mg calcite and dolomite). Precipitation of carbonates \n\noccurs when bicarbonate-rich, high alkalinity pore fluids become sufficiently enriched in \n\ncalcium and magnesium ions supplied mainly from seawater, (according to the Sr isotopic \n\ncomposition). The precipitation of the authigenic carbonate minerals induces the \n\nlithification of the sediments and it is the mechanism assumed for the formation of the \n\npavements, crusts and chimneys. HS-, a product of this reaction will precipitate as pyrite \n\nor, together with methane which has not been completely consumed, will feed \n\nchemosynthetic communities at the seafloor, such as Bathymodiolus and Calyptogena, that \n\nare found cemented in the aragonite pavements (Figure 5.17). \n\nThe different morphologies and different carbonate types reflect different flow \n\npatterns through the sediments. If the flux of fluid enriched in methane is channellised \n\nthrough the SRZ of the sedimentary column, using borrows or sediment heterogeneities as \n\npathways, the SMTZ and the consequently precipitation of the authigenic carbonates will \n\nbe developed around these fluid conduits. Because this fluid conduits correspond to \n\nconfined environments in relation to seawater influence, sulphate depletion can be reached \n\nand dolomite will be the dominant mineralogy. The lithification of the sediments will result \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 193\n\nin the formation of the dolomite nodules, crusts and chimneys (Figure 5.17). As can be \n\nobserved in the NRL Seamap image (Figure 5.2) The locations where the dolomite \n\nchimneys occur are presently swept by the flow of the Mediterranean undercurrent which \n\ncan remobilize the unconsolidated sediment inside of which the chimneys here probably \n\nformed and therefore produce the collapse of the individual chimneys, explaining their \n\npresent position on the seafloor. \n\nAragonite pavements represent precipitation of authigenic carbonates in a similar \n\nprocess to that of dolomite morphologies, but in an environment closer to the seafloor \n\ninterface. The aragonite pavements will be formed at the sediment-seawater interface or \n\nclose to it, as a product of the AOM-SR coupling process that can result from an active and \n\ndiscrete venting or from an more diffuse and low intensity venting process. Because these \n\nprocesses are more ventilated by seawater where high alkalinity is coupled with high \n\nsulphate concentrations, the mineralogy is dominated by aragonite. \n\nThe MDAC can be interpreted as a fossil record of extensive methane seepage in this \n\nparticular area of the Gulf of Cadiz, spatially associated with probable deep fault systems, \n\nwith mud volcanoes and diapirs, which constitute preferential pathways for fluid \n\nmigration. They constitute a probably important natural methane sequestration process, on \n\nwhich microbial activity has played an important role on the formation of these MDAC. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 194 \n\n \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 195\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 6.

If methane oxidation is the main source of the \n\nbicarbonate then the ?13C value of the carbonate will be depleted in relation to the normal \n\nmarine carbonate value (Figure 6.1). \n\nThe oxygen isotopic record in marine carbonates represents one of the most \n\nimportant proxies for past oceanographic reconstructions. Variations in the ?18O values of \n\nocean seawater during glacial and interglacial periods are incorporated into the marine \n\ncarbonates, that also record information of seawater temperature, according to the \n\nrespective fractionation factors of the different carbonate phases (Friedman and O'Neil, \n\n1977). Therefore, the different mineralogical fractionation effects must be considered in \n\nthe interpretation of the MDAC isotopic data. In order to estimate the isotopic composition \n\nof the original pore waters and the temperature of formation of the MDAC, the isotopic \n\ncomposition has to be corrected for the effects of the different isotopic fractionation for the \n\ndifferent mineralogy. \n\nThis study is focused on the analyses of the carbon, oxygen and strontium isotopic \n\ncomposition of the MDAC samples recovered from the Gulf of Cadiz. Carbon isotopes are \n\nused to constrain the carbon source and the composition of the fluids from which the \n\nMDAC were formed from. Oxygen isotopes in aragonite, calcite and dolomite are used to \n\nestimate ?18O isotopic composition of the fluids from which the difent carbonate phases \n\nprecipitated from and compared with the present day pore water isotopic composition and \n\nwith estimated seawater ?18O isotopic composition and temperatures for glacial/interglacial \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 6.

Carbon isotopic composition of some geologically important materials. Modified from (Hoefs, \n\n1997) \n \n\n6.1.1 Fractionation factor \n\nIsotope fractionation is the partition of isotopes between two substances or two \n\nphases of the same substance with different isotope ratios. The main processes responsible \n\nfor the isotopic fractionation are isotope exchange reactions and kinetic processes (which \n\ndepend primarily on differences in reaction rates of isotopic molecules). Equilibrium \n\nisotope partitioning between minerals and fluids depends on the chemical composition and \n\nbond character of the mineral. This is well known for oxygen and carbon isotope \n\nfractionation between minerals and aqueous fluids (Kim and O'Neil, 1997). \n\nThe fractionation of oxygen and carbon isotopes differs between the different CaCO3 \n\npolymorphs. As an example, in aragonite, 18O is enriched by 1.0\u2030 and 13C by 1.7\u2030 \n\nrelative to calcite (Romanek et al., 1992; Bohm et al., 2000). This is the result of the \n\ndifferent vibrational behaviour of the carbonate ions, influenced by the structure of the \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 197\n\ncrystal lattice and the atomic coordination numbers. The denser aragonite lattice with its \n\nCa(9)O coordination enhances the fractionation of oxygen and carbon compared to calcite \n\nCa(6)O coordination. The isotope fractionation effects are mainly caused by \n\nthermodynamic (vibrational) behaviour of the C-O bonds in the carbonate ion (CO32-). \n\nThe oxygen isotopic ratio of the carbonates is determined principally by the ?18O of \n\nthe fluid from which the carbonate precipitated, by the temperature of precipitation and by \n\nthe carbonate mineralogy (each carbonate mineral has a different fractionation factor) \n\n(Friedman and O'Neil, 1977). \n\nThe fractionation factor (?) between two compounds (A and B) is defined as the ratio \n\nof the numbers of any two isotopes in the chemical compound A divided by the \n\ncorresponding ratio for the other chemical compound B: \n\nBABA RR /=??       (6.1) \n\nFor example, the fractionation factor for the exchange of 18O and 16O between water \n\nand CaCO3 is expressed by the reaction: \n\n3\n1816\n\n23\n1618\n\n2 3/13/1 OCaCOHOCaCOH +?+   (6.2) \n\nWith the fractionation factor ?CaCO3-H2O defined as: \n\nOH\n\nCaCO\nCaCO OO\n\nOO\n\n2\n1618\n\n3\n1618\n\n3 )/(\n)/(\n\n=?

The ? value is defined as the per mil proportion of the isotopic ratio measurement \n\nof a compound over the isotopic ratio of a standard sample. \n\nIn the case of the oxygen isotopes, the ? value is defined as: \n\n[ ]\n[ ] 1000*1tan1618\n\n1618\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?=\n\ndards\n\nsample\n\nOO\nOO\n\n?

Origin, paleo-temperature and composition reconstruction of fluids associated with the \nformation of MDAC in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 198\n\n6.1.3 Oxygen isotopic standards \n\nTwo different ? scales are generally used for the oxygen isotopes: the ?18O(SMOW) and \n\nthe ?18O(PDB), because of the two different categories of users who have been traditionally \n\nengaged on O-isotope studies. \n\nThe PDB standard is used in low temperature carbonate studies. It is referred to the \n\nCretaceous Belemnite from the Pee Dee Formation in South California and was the \n\nlaboratory working standard used at the University of Chicago in the early 1950s when the \n\npaleo-temperature scale was developed (McCrea, 1950; Epstein et al., 1951, 1953). The \n\noriginal supply of this standard has long been exhausted and secondary standards, whose \n\nisotopic composition is considered calibrated to PDB, were introduced (Table 6.1); the new \n\nequivalent scale is referred to as the Vienna Peedee Belemnite (VPDB). \n\nThe Standard Mean Ocean Water (SMOW) scale is generally used for oxygen \n\nisotope analyses of non-carbonate phases such as waters, silicates, phosphates, sulphates \n\nand high-temperature carbonates. Similarly, the exhaustion of the original standard sample \n\nsupply introduced the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW) scale, which is \n\nequivalent to the SMOW. Table 6.1 shows ?18O values for commonly used oxygen isotope \n\nstandards on both scales. \n\n \nTable 6.1. ?18O values of commonly used O-isotope standards (Hoefs, 1997). \n \n\nStandard Material PDB \n\nscale \n\nSMOW \n\nscale \n\nNBS-18 Carbonatite -23.00 (7.20) \n\nNBS-19 Marble -2.20 (28.64) \n\nNBS-20 Limestone -4.14 (26.64) \n\nNBS-28 Quartz (-20.67) 9.60 \n\nNBS-30 Biotite (-25.30) 5.10 \n\nGISP Water (-53.99) -24.75 \n\nSLAP Water (-83.82) -55.50 \n\n(parentheses denote calculated values) \n\n \n\nThe conversion equations between ?18O(SMOW) and ?18O(PDB) and vice versa can be \n\ncalculated by the Friedman and O'Neil (1977) equations (6.4) and (6.5): \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 199\n\n94.29*97006.0 )(\n18\n\n)(\n18 ?= SMOWPDB OO ??

They both \n\nconclude that, at low temperatures (0-20\u00baC), there is significant 18O/16O fractionation, of up \n\nto a few per mil, between the different alkaline earth carbonate phases. \n\nSeveral questions have been raised concerning the Epstein et al., (1953) method. \n\nAmong the most important are: the validity of the original calibrations; the influence on the \n\nequilibrium fractionation factor of the different CaCO3 polymorphic phases; the chemical \n\nvariability of biogenic shells or of the carbonate cements; the kinetic effects of both \n\nbiological (vital effects) and chemical origin; the reliability of acid fractionation factors; \n\nand the recognition of the sometimes important diagenetic processes that alter the original \n\nisotopic composition. \n\n\n\n \nMud volcanism and fluid escape structures in the South Portuguese Margin and the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 204\n\nO'Neil et al., (1969) addressed some of these questions during their laboratory \n\nexperiments of inorganic precipitation of alkaline-earth carbonates at high (200-500\u00baC) and \n\nlow temperatures (0-25\u00baC) and calculated the fractionation equation (6.13):  \n\n( ) 89.21078.2ln1000 26 ?= T?       (6.13) \nO'Neil et al., (1969) identified differences of the isotopic fractionation with variable \n\ndivalent cationic content on the carbonate phases. This dependence was quantified for the \n\nfirst time by Tarutani et al., (1969), based on synthetic carbonate precipitation of calcite, \n\naragonite and Mg-calcite from various bicarbonate solutions. The quantification of the \n\neffect of the MgCO3 content in calcite on the oxygen isotopic fractionation has shown that, \n\nat 25\u00baC, for each mol% of MgCO3 the 1000ln? increases by 0.06\u2030 in relation to pure \n\ncalcite (Tarutani et al., 1969). Simultaneously, aragonite shows a small but significant 18O \n\nenrichment of 0.6\u2030 in relation to calcite at 25\u00baC (Tarutani et al., 1969). \n\nFriedman and O'Neil (1977) established the equation of the oxygen isotope \n\nfractionation as a function of temperature and the Mg mol% content in calcite: \n\n( ) 326 %*06.089.21078.2ln1000 MgCOMolT +?=?

As can be observed from Figure 6.2, this equation curve \n\ncorresponds to an average position in relationship to the several diferrent equations defined \n\nfor calcite. For Mg-calcite, the Friedman and O'Neil (1977) equation will be used, as the \n\noxygen isotope fractionation as a function of temperature and the Mg mol% content in Mg-\n\ncalcite. This equation is considered to best represent the fractionation equation for Mg-\n\ncalcite mineralogy, as it has been used successfully in a large range of paleo-temperature \n\ncalculations in Mg-calcites from a large range of settings, including in cold seep \n\ncarbonates. \n\n \n\n6.1.4.2 Protodolomite and Dolomite \nThe failure to precipitate dolomite in the laboratory at low temperatures (Land, 1998) \n\nhas not allowed the direct determination of the temperature-dependent oxygen isotopic \n\nfractionation factor between low temperature dolomite and the solution from which it \n\n\n\n \nMud volcanism and fluid escape structures in the South Portuguese Margin and the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 206\n\nprecipitates. In order to constrain this limitation indirect approaches have been employed. \n\nOne approach consists in using natural coexisting calcite and dolomite. Assuming the \n\nprecipitation in equilibrium from the same water and at the same temperature, the \n\ndifference between the ?18O values of both minerals (?18Odol-cal) should be constant. As the \n\ncalcite-water fractionation factor is known and the ?18Odol-cal values can be measured, the \n\ndolomite-water fractionation factor can therefore be indirectly calculated. Another \n\napproach consists on the extrapolation of the dolomite-water oxygen isotope fractionation \n\ndetermined from the high-temperature experiments to low-temperatures. \n\nIsotopic studies of calcite and dolomite metamorphic assemblages predicted an \n\nequilibrium 18O enrichment in dolomite relative to calcite of 5-9\u2030 (Clayton and Epstein, \n\n1958; Engel et al., 1958; Sheppard and Schwarcz, 1970). \n\n( ) 40.01045.0ln1000 26 ?= T?

The \n\ninconsistencies in these results, make it difficult to satisfactory characterize the \n\nenvironmental conditions of dolomite precipitation from its oxygen isotopic composition. \n\nThe inconsistencies in the ?18Odol-cal values have been discussed and referred to by Land \n\n(1998) as the \u201c? problem.\u201d \n\nMore recently, geomicrobiological research has introduced the microbial factor \n\n(Vasconcelos and McKenzie, 1997) to the complex and large number of interacting factors, \n\nsuch as thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, hydrology, host-rock mineralogy and texture \n\n(Hardie, 1987), that intervene in the process of dolomite formation. With the discovery of \n\nbacterial-mediated processes that induced the precipitation of dolomite at low temperatures \n\n(Vasconcelos, 1994; Vasconcelos et al., 1995; Vasconcelos and McKenzie, 1997; \n\nWarthmann et al., 2000), it become finally possible to calibrate the dolomite-water oxygen \n\n\n\n \nMud volcanism and fluid escape structures in the South Portuguese Margin and the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 208\n\nisotope fractionation factor (Vasconcelos et al., 2005). Experiments under anaerobic \n\nconditions with pure microbial stain of sulphate-reducing bacteria (Desulfovibrio stain LV \n\nform1) allowed the precipitation of dolomite in a synthetic growth medium solution at 25, \n\n30, 40 and 45\u00baC. These experiments allowed the calculation of the oxygen isotope \n\nfractionation equation (6.28), as a function of temperature (Vasconcelos et al., 2005): \n\n( ) 26.01073.2ln1000 26 += T?

This assumption is corroborated by \n\nobservations that indicate that the precipitation is not biologically controlled, but simply \n\nbiologically induced by the alteration of the microenvironment surrounding the bacteria \n\ncells (Vasconcelos et al., 2005). \n\n \n\n-5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30\nTemperature (\u00baC)\n\n-5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n?1\n8 O\n\n D\nol\n\nom\nite\n\n (P\nD\n\nB\n)\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8Matthews and Katz (1977)\n\nVasconcelos et al., (2005)\n\nProtoDol:\nFriedman and O'Neil (1977) 30 mol% Mg\n\nProtoDol:\nFriedman and O'Neil (1977) 40 mol% Mg\n\nProtoDol: Irwin (1980)\n\nClayton et al., (1968); Northrop and Clayton (1966)\n\nfor 0\u2030 SMOW water\n\n \nFigure 6.3. 18O-fractionation equations for dolomite and proto-dolomite. \n\n \n\nFrom all the different temperature oxygen fractionation equations, the Vasconcelos et \n\nal., (2005) equation is used in this work as the dolomite fractionation equation.

The fractionation differences between the two phases (?18Oarag-calc) exhibit \n\na significant variability, function of the fractionation equation considered. The Kim and \n\nO'Neil (1997) proposed equation (6.16) for calcite and the Grossman and Ku (1986) \n\nequation (6.28) for aragonite present the large difference in the ?18Oarag-calc of 1.60\u2030. \n\nHowever comparing the Patterson et al., (1993) estimation for aragonite (6.32) with the \n\nFriedman and O'Neil (1977) equation (6.14), the fractionation difference ?18Oarag-calc has \n\nthe minimum value of 0.2\u2030. \n\nThe difference between the Bohm et al. (2000) fractionation equation for aragonite to \n\nthe Kim and O'Neil (1997) fractionation equation for calcite shows a ?18Oarag-calc of 1.40\u2030 \n\nand is considered the most probable fractionation difference that would be expected on the \n\nmethane-derived authigenic calcite and aragonite, considering their formation in isotopic \n\nequilibrium. \n\nAlso to be noted is that the presence of Mg in the calcite lattice will move the oxygen \n\nfractionation equations towards a heavier isotopic values, as shown by the Friedman and \n\nO'Neil (1977) equations (grey lines in Figure 6.5). For 8 mol% of Mg in calcite, the \n\n?18Oarag-MgCalc is variable with the temperature, increasing from 0.20\u2030 at near 0\u00baC and \n\nreaching 0.60\u2030 at 25\u00baC. Therefore, the presence of Mg in the calcite lattice or the higher \n\nabundance of Mg-calcite in the carbonate mixture should result in smaller differences \n\nbetween the fractionation equations of aragonite and calcite and more similar isotopic \n\nvalues for aragonite and calcite. \n\n\n\n \nMud volcanism and fluid escape structures in the South Portuguese Margin and the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 212\n\nfor 0\u2030 SMOW water\n\nArag: Grossman &amp; Ku (1986)\nArag: Hudson &amp; Anderson (1989)\nArag: Paterson et al., (1993)\nArag: Bohm et al., (2000)\nCalc: McCrea (1950)_Florida\nCalc: McCrea (1950)_CapeCod\nCalc: Epstein et al., (1953)\nCalc: O'Neil et al (1969)\nCalc: Friedman and O'Neil (1977)_for pure calcite\nCalc: Friedman and O'Neil (1977)_8mol%Mg\nCalc: Friedman and O'Neil (1977)_30mol%Mg\nCalc: Kim and O'Neil (1997)\n\n-5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30\nTemperature (\u00baC)\n\n-5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n?1\n8 O\n\n C\nal\n\nci\nte\n\n/A\nra\n\ngo\nni\n\nte\n (P\n\nD\nB\n\n)\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n1.40\u2030 ?18Oarag-calc\n\n1.60\u2030 ?18Oarag-calc\n\n \nFigure 6.5.

The petrography of the \n\ncarbonates was examined in polished slabs and thin sections by standard petrographic and \n\ncathodoluminescence techniques. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations were \n\ncarried out, coupled with energy dispersive spectrometer X-ray elementary analysis (EDS), \n\nin fresh fractured surfaces and in samples etched with HCl 10% during 3-4 minutes before \n\nthe SEM observations. \n\nSamples for XRD, Sr, total organic carbon, carbonate content, carbon and oxygen \n\nstable isotope were extracted from transversal and longitudinal cuts and micro-drilled \n\nalong radial and longitudinal profiles. \n\nBulk mineralogy and the relative abundance of the different carbonate mineralogies \n\nin each sample were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on 134 powdered samples \n\n(Table 5.1). X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained using a Scintag X-ray diffractometer \n\nwith CuK? radiation (1.5405 \u00c5 wavelength). Scans were done from 5\u00ba to 60\u00ba 2? at \n\n0.02\u00ba/sec, using a 40 kV accelerating voltage and 30 mA current. As the intensity of the \n\ndiffraction pattern of a mineral in a mixture is proportional to its concentration, estimates \n\nof the relative proportions of the minerals in a sample were made by measuring their \n\nrelative peak areas. Peak identification and minerals relative abundance estimation were \n\nperformed using the Scintag interpretation software and the MacDiff\u00ae software packages. \n\nThe peak areas were measured for the main peaks of the carbonate minerals aragonite \n\n(3.40 \u00c5), calcite (&lt;8 mol% MgCO3, 3.036 to 3.012 \u00c5), high Mg-calcite (8 to 30 mol% \n\nMgCO3, 3.012 to 2.946 \u00c5), protodolomite or Ca-dolomite (30 to 40 mol% MgCO3, 2.946 \n\nto 2.916 \u00c5) and dolomite (40 to 55 mol% MgCO3, 2.916 to 2.871 \u00c5). The Mg:Ca ratio of \n\nthe carbonate minerals was calculated from the shift of the d-spacing of the (104) reflection \n\npeak of calcite and dolomite from the stechoimetric peaks positions in the diffraction \n\nspectra (Goldsmith and Graf, 1958; Lumsden, 1979). \n\nSamples for carbon and oxygen stable isotopic analyses were prepared by reacting at \n\n90\u00b0C with 100% phosphoric acid on an automated carbonate device connected to a VG-\n\nPRISM mass spectrometer calibrated with NBS19, NBS 18 and NBS 20.

For temperature calculations of the dolomite \n\nsamples, dolomite ?18O values were corrected for the analytical offset of +1.63\u2030, \n\nconsequence of the unequal oxygen fractionation during the reaction to CO2 (Rosenbaum \n\nand Sheppard, 1986).

A detailed description of the leaching technique is described in \n\nAppendix C. Samples for EDTA were retrieved from the powdered samples collected with \n\na micro-drill, each sample was spitted in two fractions. One sub-sample was used for XRD \n\nanalysis and for carbon and oxygen isotopic analysis of the bulk carbonate. The second \n\nsub-sample was leached with 20 ml boiling 0.25 M EDTA solution at pH 11 during 24 \n\nhours in glass covered containers to avoid evaporation. The solvent level was maintained at \n\n20 ml/g by adding distilled water. After 24 hours the sub-sample was taken out of the \n\nEDTA solution, washed in distilled water, freeze dried, examined with XRD and measured \n\nfor carbon and oxygen isotopic composition. \n\nSamples for 87Sr/86Sr were dissolved in 20 ml, 1.0 N ultra pure acid acetic, \n\ncentrifuged, and then decanted and evaporated dry. Then, they were re-dissolved in 20 ml \n\nof 5-N HNO3 and loaded into columns containing the AG8 50W BioRad Sr-specific resin. \n\nThe 87Sr/86Sr composition of the carbonates (Arag, Calc, Mg-Calc and Dol) was \n\ndetermined using a VG-Sector 54 Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometer.

Extrapolated ?18O isotopic \n\ncomposition of pure dolomite from EDTA leaching of 6 samples (Figure 6.10 and Figure \n\nC.9) indicate an average value of +5.66\u2030 (PDB). \n\nThe calculation of the ?18O isotopic composition of pure calcite or, of the mixture of \n\ncalcite + high Mg-calcite (Table C.2., Appendix C), indicates a calculated value of \n\n+0.93\u2030 \u00b1 0.67 (PDB). The extrapolation from the linear best fit of the plot of the ?18O \n\nisotopic composition as a function of the dolomite content Figure 6.10 indicates an \n\nestimated composition for pure calcite phase, or to the mixture of calcite + high Mg-calcite \n\nof 1.4\u2030 (PDB). The calculated (Table C.2., Appendix C) ?13C for a pure calcite + high \n\nMg-calcite mixture indicates a value of -9.83\u2030 \u00b1 6.17 (PDB). As such, all the estimations \n\npoint to ~1.4\u2030 (PDB) near seawater composition of the calcite phase and a positive \n\n~5.7\u2030 (PDB) ?18O isotopic composition of the dolomite. \n\nThe difference between the oxygen isotopic fractionation factors of the two end-\n\nmembers pure dolomite and pure calcite (?18Odol-cal) is 4.2\u2030 (PDB) or 4.7\u2030 (PDB), \n\nconsidering the different extrapolations.

These values are reported in Table \n\n5.1 and Figure 5.9.

The linear best fit \n\nequation for all the samples, that has a poor coefficient of determination, shows a median \n\n?18O isotopic value of 2.6\u2030 (PDB) for the pure calcite phase. This value is higher that the \n\n1.44\u2030 (PDB) estimated from the EDTA leaching technique. \n\nThe plot of the bulk ?13C isotopic composition of the dolomite chimneys crusts and \n\nnodules as function of their dolomite to carbonate ratio (Figure 6.12) indicates an evident \n\ntrend with a ?13C value of -37\u2030 \u00b110\u2030 (PDB) for pure dolomite end-member and -18\u2030 \n\n\u00b110\u2030 (PDB) for calcite+Mg-calcite end-member. The extrapolations of the ?13C values \n\nfor pure dolomite, based on the ?13C values of bulk and leached material (Figure C.12) \n\nindicate ?13C compositions ranging from -52\u2030 to -28\u2030 (PDB) for the pure dolomite \n\nphase, with an average value of -39\u2030 \u00b110\u2030 (PDB). The calcite and Mg-calcite phases 13C \n\nare heavier with the extrapolated values ranging from -2 to -23\u2030 (PDB) with an average \n\nvalue of -9.83\u2030 \u00b16.17\u2030 (PDB). \n\nIn conclusion, both EDTA and bulk samples clearly indicate for the calcite a closer \n\nto normal seawater isotopic composition, also seen on the oxygen isotopes; and a lighter \n\ncarbon isotopic and heavier oxygen isotopic composition for dolomite. \n\n \n\n6.4.1.3 Calcite and Mg-calcite vs Aragonite in aragonite pavements \nCalcite, Mg-calcite and aragonite occur in samples of aragonite pavements, with \n\ndifferent mineral proportions and with different C and O isotopic compositions. These \n\nvalues are reported in Table 5.1 and Figure 5.9. The high variability on the 18O values of \n\nbulk samples of aragonite pavements is the consequence of the different mineralogical \n\ncomposition (calcite/aragonite ratios) and possible also different temperature of formation \n\nand different pore fluid composition. \n\nThe aragonite pavement samples reveal a linear correlation between the mineral \n\ncontent i.e., the ratio aragonite/(calcite+Mg-calcite), and the ?18O composition (Figure \n\n6.13). This correlation indicates a ?18O calculated isotopic composition of 2.3\u2030 (PDB) for \n\nthe end-member pure calcite phase. The ?18O calculated isotopic composition of the end-\n\nmember pure aragonite is 4.2\u2030 (PDB). This corresponds to a difference between the \n\nisotopic fractionation factors (?18Oarag-cal) of 1.9\u2030 (PDB). This value is higher than the \n\n\n\n \nMud volcanism and fluid escape structures in the South Portuguese Margin and the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 222\n\nexpected theoretical maximum limit value of 1.6\u2030 (PDB) (Section 6.1.4.4, Figure 6.5). \n\nThere is no evident different correlation between the mineral content and the ?18O \n\ncomposition as function of the sample location but, samples from Hesperides and Ginsburg \n\nMVs are located slightly above the average trend line, while samples from Jesus Baraza, \n\nand Faro MVs are located above that line. It is not evident any clear correlation between \n\nthe different aragonite types (lithified mud volcano breccias, intraformational breccias, \n\nshell crusts and stromatolitic fabric) and their ?13C and ?18O composition. It should \n\nhowever be noted that the intraformational breccias present the higher ?13C and ?18O \n\nvalues. \n\nIn relation to the carbon isotopic composition (Figure 6.14), there is no clear \n\nevidence of an isotopic trend with the mineralogical composition. Nevertheless it is of \n\nsignificance that shell samples collected within the aragonite pavements present heavier \n\n?13C values than the shells collected from dolomite chimney samples. The aragonite \n\npavement cements present a wide range of ?13C values from -14.2 to -56.2\u2030 (PDB). \n\n \n\n?18O = 0.01949 * Arag(wt%) + 2.29331\n\n1.9\u2030 ?18Oarag-calc\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\nAragonite content wt.%\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n?1\n8 O\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n?1\n8 O\n\n103 104\n\n105\n\n106\n\n107\n110\n\n108 109\n\n86\n88\n\n100102 101\n\nShells collected from Aragonite pavements\nShells collected from Dolomite chimneys\nAragonite pavements from Hesperides\nAragonite pavements from Faro MV\nAragonite pavements from Jesus Baraza\nAragonite pavements from Ginsburg\n\nAragoniteCalcite +\nMg-calcite  \n\nFigure 6.13.

As the variation \n\nof the strontium isotopic composition of seawater through time is well defined (Elderfield, \n\n1986; Farrell et al., 1995), the strontium isotopes can be used to constrain the source of the \n\nfluids of authigenic carbonates.  \n87Sr/86Sr ratios on the different types of carbonate samples (dolomite crusts and \n\nchimneys and aragonite pavements) show values between 0.709110 and 0.709191 (Table \n\n6.3). The aragonite pavement carbonate 87Sr/86Sr ratio clearly reflects the isotopic ratio of \n\ncontemporaneous seawater of 0.709175 (Paytan et al., 1993) indicating that the authigenic \n\ncarbonates of the aragonite pavements were formed from fluids with Sr values similar to \n\npresent day seawater. Dolomite chimney samples shows 87Sr/86Sr values close to the \n\ncontemporaneous seawater composition, but in spite of its large error value limits, the \n\ndolomite chimney sample (3463-A08) presents a 87Sr/86Sr value (0.709110) that is lighter \n\nthat the present day seawater composition (Figure 6.15 and Figure 6.16). However, the \n\ndolomite crust sample 3458-A03 has 87Sr/86Sr values close to the contemporaneous \n\nAragonite Pavement samples\nShells from Aragonite Pavements\n\n\n\n \nMud volcanism and fluid escape structures in the South Portuguese Margin and the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 224\n\nseawater composition. The difference on the strontium isotopic value of the dolomite \n\nchimney sample is interpreted as reflecting a contribution of older seawater composition \n\n(indicated by the age of 245 ka \u00b1 9.3% obtained by U/Th, as discussed in chapter 7) or \n\npossibly a contribution from deeper strontium rich fluids (with compositions closer to the \n\nBonjardim and Ginsburg MVs estimated end member pore fluids, Figure 6.15). The \n\ndolomite crust and the aragonite pavement, they both reflect a contemporaneous seawater \n\ncomposition. The 87Sr/86Sr ratios of the Captain Arutyunov, Bonjardim and Ginsburg MVs \n\nclearly deviates from the present day seawater values (Figure 6.15). Thus the  87Sr/86Sr \n\nratios of the analysed authigenic carbonates do not indicate a clear and major addition of Sr \n\nfrom deep seated fluids, the MDAC preferably reflect contemporaneous seawater Sr \n\ncomposition. The dolomite chimney sample has a signal that supports a deeper seated \n\nfluids and/or an older seawater contribution that nevertheless corresponds to a minor \n\ncontribution while the main Sr source is seawater. \n\n \nTable 6.3.

On the graph is also plotted the Present day seawater \nstrontium value from Payton et al., (1993). \n\n \n\n \n\n6.5 Discussion \n\n \n\n6.5.1 Methane rich pore waters \n\nAs discussed in chapter 5, the carbon isotopic composition of the authigenic \n\ncarbonates (?13C = -56.16\u2030 to -8.42\u2030 PDB, Figure 5.9 and Table 5.1) reflect the carbon \n\nsource indicating that they were originated from pore fluids enriched in methane. Most \n\nprobably, from a mixture of moderate to extremely 13C-depleted methane enriched \n\nfluids,given that ?13C values of gas hydrates and pore water are in the range -80 to -20\u2030 \n\nPDB (Stadnitskaia et al., 2006; Niemann et al., Submitted; Nuzzo et al., Submitted), with \n\nnormal seawater and HCO3- derived from dissolution of carbonate tests (characterized by \n\n?13C values ~0\u2030 PDB). Two potential sources of methane can be considered for the Gulf \n\nof Cadiz authigenic carbonates: thermogenic and biogenic.  \n\nAs the mineral composition of the authigenic carbonates may reflect mixing from the \n\n\n\n \nMud volcanism and fluid escape structures in the South Portuguese Margin and the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 226\n\ndifferent carbon sources, the inference of the isotopic composition of the carbon pool from \n\nthe carbonate mineral isotopic composition is complex. Fractionation of the carbon will \n\nalso depend on the extent to which the different carbon reservoirs are oxidized. However, it \n\nis possible to estimate the ?13C composition of the fluids from which the authigenic \n\ncarbonates were precipitated from. Since many samples have ?13C values heavier than \n\nbiogenic methane, mixing with other carbon sources is necessary and apparently common. \n\nThe gas hydrates and pore water gas compositions collected from mud volcanoes (MVs) in \n\nthe Gulf of Cadiz indicate, in general, a mixture of biogenic and thermogenic gases, with \n\nsecondary migration, mixing and microbial alteration of hydrocarbons (Stadnitskaia et al., \n\n2006). Thus, it is possible to recognize that the authigenic carbonates most probably reflect \n\na similar fluid composition. As such, the isotopic composition of the authigenic carbonates \n\nreflects a major mixing of thermogenic and biogenic methane-rich fluids with non-methane \n\ncarbon sources where, most probably, seawater is the most important. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.5.2 Paleo-temperatures and fluid composition on dolomite crusts, \n\nchimneys and nodules \n\nTo investigate whether the analysed ?18O isotopic values of the dolomite crusts, \n\nchimneys and nodules reflect equilibrium crystallization with the present day seawater \n\ntemperatures and oxygen isotopic composition, the Vasconcelos et al., (2005) low-\n\ntemperature experimental determination of the oxygen isotope fractionation of dolomite \n\n(equation 6.28) and the Kim and O'Neil (1997) proposed equation (6.16) for calcite-water \n\nfractionation on inorganic precipitation at low temperature were used. \n\nPure calcite end-member phase have an estimated average oxygen isotopic \n\ncomposition of 1.4\u2030 PDB and a wide range of values estimated based on the EDTA and \n\ncalculated based on the calcite-dolomite trend line (Figure 6.10 and Figure 6.11). \n\nTherefore, a minimum value of -1.6\u2030 (PDB) and a maximum value of 5.0\u2030 PDB can be \n\ndefined. Pure dolomite end-member phase has an average oxygen isotopic composition of \n\n5.7\u2030 PDB and a wide range of values with a minimum and maximum value estimated to \n\nbe 2.7 and 7.4\u2030 PDB, respectively (Figure 6.11 and Table 6.4), based on the EDTA \n\ncalculated calcite-dolomite trend line. \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 6.

Figure 6.18 illustrates the different temperature 18O-fractionation equations \n\ndefined for calcite and/or Mg-calcite and the extrapolated range of ?18O values of the \n\ncalcite end-member phase of the dolomite crusts, chimneys and nodules, assuming oxygen \n\nisotope compositions of the pore water changing from -2 to +3\u2030 SMOW. In both figures \n\nis also shown (by the blue rectangles) the present day temperature intervals that occur in \n\nthe places where the MDAC were collected (dark blue, 8 to 12\u00baC) and the temperature \n\nrange (4 to 14\u00baC) considered to represent extreme temperature limits that could occur in \n\nparticular conditions as the glacial or intense periods of the MO. \n\nFrom Figure 6.17 and Figure 6.18 it is evident that the extrapolated average oxygen \n\nisotopic values of calcite (1.4\u2030 PDB) can be explained by precipitation from normal \n\nseawater composition (0-1\u2030 SMOW) at the present day temperature range (8-12\u00baC) that \n\ncharacterizes the different places where the MDAC were collected from. The average ?18O \n\nvalue (1.4\u2030 PDB) of the end-member calcite (that, as seen, represents the pelagic fraction \n\ncarbonate) is identical to the measured values of clam shells and coral branches (2.8\u2030 \n\nPDB, Chapter 5, Table 5.1) that were collected from the external surface of dolomite \n\nchimneys which, as also indicated by their average ?13C value (0.36\u2030 PDB) were formed, \n\nmost probably, in equilibrium with ambient bottom water. Therefore, the average isotopic \n\ncomposition of the calcite phase on the dolomite crusts, chimneys and nodules is \n\ninterpreted as reflecting the dominance of the pelagic carbonate source on the total \n\ncarbonate content of the samples. This pelagic calcite is characterized by isotopic \n\ncompositions of 1-2\u2030 PDB and reflects precipitation from normal seawater at present day \n\ntemperature conditions. \n\nSamples with oxygen isotopic compositions that show a clear deviation from these \n\naverage values correspond to samples where the pelagic calcite fraction is not dominant \n\nand the authigenic calcite that composes the cement is significantly controlling the isotopic \n\ncomposition of the total calcite phase. The extrapolated minimum and maximum limit \n\nvalues of oxygen isotopes of calcite and/or high Mg-calcite cannot be explained by \n\nprecipitation from normal seawater composition (0-1\u2030 SMOW) at the present day \n\ntemperature range, not even considering the minimum expected temperature during glacial \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 6. Origin, paleo-temperature and composition reconstruction of fluids associated with the formation \nof MDAC in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 229\n\nstages (4\u00baC) or the maximum expected temperature of 14\u00baC. \n\nThe minimum limit of -1.6\u2030 PDB of some calcites can be explained by precipitation \n\nfrom depleted pore waters, with ?18O of ?-1.5\u2030 SMOW (Table 6.5). Precipitation from \n\nnormal seawater would require higher temperatures (>21\u00baC). Such high temperatures are \n\nnot expected to occur in the superficial sediments, since the thermal gradient \n\nmeasurements on some of the mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz indicate very low heat \n\nflow (Kopf et al., 2004). Therefore, the minimum ?18O value of hypothetically pure calcite \n\nphase (-1.6\u2030 PDB) is interpreted as representing precipitation from a 18O-depleted source \n\nwater (?-1.5\u2030 SMOW). The most probable explanation for this depleted 18O pore waters \n\nis an important contribution from residual waters formed during the formation of methane \n\nhydrates. During the formation of gas hydrates, the 18O-rich water molecules are \n\nincorporated preferentially in the clathrate lattice leaving the remaining pore waters with \n\nincreased ionic concentrations and with excess of 18O-depleted water molecules (Ussler \n\nand Paull, 1995; Ussler and Paull, 2001). \n\nGiven that temperatures less than 4\u00baC are very improbable to occur, even considering \n\nglacial periods and with changes in the MO pathways and their absence at the sampling \n\nlocations, the maximum limit value of 4.8\u2030 PDB on some samples can only be explained \n\nby precipitation from heavier pore waters. Alternatively, the maximum limit values of \n\n4.8\u2030 PDB of some samples could be explained by precipitation from normal pore waters \n\n(?18Ow up to 1\u2030 SMOW), if the mineralogy were composed with large dominance of high \n\nMg-calcite with high amounts of mol% of Mg. However, this is not the case for all the \n\nsamples. Some samples (c.a. 3426-A01.63) are composed of calcite (87% wt%) with 7.7% \n\nmol% Mg and dolomite (with 43% mol% Mg). Therefore, the maximum limit values \n\n(4.8\u2030 PDB) of some samples are preferably interpreted as resulting of the precipitation \n\nfrom 18O-enriched pore waters, with ?18Ow of at least 2.8\u2030 SMOW (Table 6.5) under \n\nseawater temperatures of 4\u00baC. If the precipitation would occur under c.a. 8\u00baC, then to \n\nexplain the calcite isotopic composition it would be required that the fluids would have a \n\ncomposition of 3.8\u2030 SMOW (Table 6.5). \n\nThe variation of the oxygen isotopic composition in the North Atlantic associated \n\nwith the last deglaciation is 0.8 \u00b10.1\u2030 (Waelbroeck et al., 2002), the glacial to interglacial \n\nchange in ?18O of the deep Atlantic ranges between 0.7 and 0.8\u2030 (Schrag et al., 2002), \n\nand the change in global mean ocean ?18O between glacial and interglatial periods is \n\n\n\n \nMud volcanism and fluid escape structures in the South Portuguese Margin and the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 230\n\n1.1\u00b10.1\u2030 SMOW (Schrag et al., 1996). In addition, the ?18O glacial-interglacial variations \n\nof the of bottom waters and of pore waters do not explain the calculated negative ?18Ow \nvalues (?-1.5\u2030 SMOW). Therefore, the at least 2.8\u2030 18O-enriched pore waters cannot be \n\nexplained as having an origin from fossil glacial pore waters. The heavier pore water \n\ncomposition (?18Ow ? 2.8\u2030 SMOW) can be produced by fluids which contain deeply \n\nsourced clay-dehidratation water, brine fluids or gas hydrate water resulting from the \n\ndissociation of gas hydrates. The hypothesis of the pore waters from which the authigenic \n\ncarbonates had precipitated from have a significant contribution from hypersaline or brine \n\nfluid is considered to be less probable because no mineralogical indicators was detected as \n\nit would be expected and because the strontium isotopic records indicate instead an \n\ndominant seawater dominance of the source fluids. The brine fluids contribution also do \n\nnot explain the calculated negative ?18O values that are required for some of the samples. \n\nIn some of the places where the MDAC were collected, in some of them the MDAC \n\nformation process is presently active or very recent, and in the various mud volcanoes in \n\nthe Gulf of Cadiz, never brine fluids were indicated in the pore water composition. The \n\nhypothesis of the source of the heavier oxygen isotopic composition as a result from deeply \n\nsourced clay-dehidratation water is possible, but is not supported by the strontium isotopic \n\ncomposition of the carbonates. The negative ?18O values of the pore fluids that are \n\nestimated for some of the samples are also difficult to be explained by pore fluids with a \n\nclay-dehidratation source. \n\nIn conclusion, given that some dolomite crust and chimney samples also indicate \n\nprecipitation from ?18O-depleted water, the source of the heavier pore water composition is \n\ninterpreted as resulting from the destabilization of gas hydrates. The estimated values of \n\nthe ?18O-enrichment of the pore water from which some dolomite and calcites had \n\nprecipitated from (?18Ow ? 2.8\u2030 SMOW) corresponds to typical reported isotopic values \n\nof pore waters resulting from the destabilization of gas hydrates (Hesse and Harrison, \n\n1981; Davidson et al., 1983; Jenden and Gieskes, 1983). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 6.

Plot showing the relation between oxygen isotope composition estimated for dolomite and \ntemperature of precipitation, for oxygen isotope composition of seawater of -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, and 3\u2030 vs. \nSMOW. The relation is based on the equation given by Vasconcelos et al., (2005). \n\n \n\nFrom these plots it is possible to conclude that the average oxygen isotopic value of \n\ndolomite (?18O of 5.7\u2030 PDB) can be explained by precipitation in isotopic equilibrium at \n\nthe lower limit of present day seawater temperature (8\u00baC) from a pore water with an \n\nnormal or close to normal isotopic composition (1.3\u2030 SMOW), that is in the range of the \n\nisotopic composition of pore waters collected from some of the mud volcanoes (0.5 to \n\n1.5\u2030 SMOW) from the Gulf of Cadiz (Mazurenko et al., 2002). If the precipitation of the \n\ndolomite is considered to occur during glacial periods, with lower seabottom water \n\n\n\n \nMud volcanism and fluid escape structures in the South Portuguese Margin and the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 234\n\ntemperatures (down to 4\u00baC) then the isotopic composition of the pore fluids can reach \n\nnormal seawater composition of (0.3\u2030) close to 0\u2030 SMOW (Table 6.5). \n\nThe minimum values of dolomite isotopic composition (lower value of 2.7\u2030 PDB) \n\ncannot be explained by precipitation in isotopic equilibrium with normal seawater oxygen \n\nisotopic composition, even considering a wider temperature range up to 14\u00baC. To \n\nprecipitate dolomite with 2.7\u2030 PDB from normal seawater (as low as 0\u2030 SMOW) would \n\nrequire a temperature of more than 16\u00baC, a value that is unlikely to occur at these water \n\ndepths. These extreme low values of dolomite are thus interpreted as precipitation from \n\nslightly 18O-depleted pore water -2.7 to -0.2\u2030 SMOW considering respectively \n\ntemperatures of 4\u00baC or 14\u00baC. The more probable explanation for this depleted 18O pore \n\nwaters, as similar to the minimum limit of the calcite isotopic composition, is the result of \n\ndolomite precipitation from residual waters formed during the crystallization of gas \n\nhydrates. \n\n \nTable 6.5.

These values are clearly higher than the theoretical values expected \n\naccording to the isotopic fractionation factors (?18Odol-cal) of 3.10\u2030 (at 4\u00baC) and 2.98\u2030 (at \n\n14\u00baC), as defined by the Vasconcelos et al., (2005) dolomite oxygen isotope fractionation \n\nequation (6.28) with the Kim and O'Neil (1997) proposed equation (6.16) for calcite. The \n\nlarge observed difference between the estimated and the theoretical equilibrium isotopic \n\nfractionation factors indicate that both minerals have not precipitated in isotopic \n\nequilibrium. According to the petrographic and XRD observations two different calcite \n\nphases can be distinguished: a pelagic calcite from the calcareous nanofossils and \n\nforaminifera shells; and a authigenic calcite that composes the cement with dolomite, \n\nproto-dolomite and high Mg-calcite (Figure 5.8.B). It is so to be expected that the dolomite \n\nphase and the pelagic calcite would not have been precipitated in isotopic equilibrium. \n\nBecause the amount of pelagic CaCO3 of the background sediment is on average 34 wt% \n\n(Section 5.4, Table 5.1) the calculated isotopic composition of the calcite and high Mg-\n\ncalcite estimated through the EDTA technique is strongly influenced by the pelagic calcite \n\nsignal. Therefore, the estimated average oxygen isotopic composition value of the calcite \n\nend-member of 0.98 and 1.44\u2030 (PDB) is reflecting the larger amount of calcite of pelagic \n\norigin, like the foraminifera and cocolith shells precipitated from normal seawater. \n\nThe authigenic calcite and/or high Mg-calcite that composes the cement, occurs in \n\nvariable proportions on the samples, and according to the petrographic observations it is \n\nexpected to be formed in isotopic equilibrium with the dolomite phase and not in \n\nequilibrium with the pelagic calcite. The isotopic values of these authigenic calcite phases \n\nare interpreted as the ones that are shown to have isotopic compositions that stand away \n\nfrom the average values and that constitutes the extreme and wide range of estimated \n\nisotopic values (from -1.6 to + 5.0\u2030 PDB). \n\nThe values of the seawater or pore fluids from which the mineral has precipitated, \n\n\n\n \nMud volcanism and fluid escape structures in the South Portuguese Margin and the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 236\n\nestimated from the average compositions of calcite and dolomite, are very similar, both \n\nindicating normal seawater composition. \n\nLow isotopic value compositions of calcite and dolomite end-members indicate \n\nformation from pore fluids with 18O-depleted isotopic compositions, considering the same \n\ntemperatures (-1.5\u2030 SMOW for calcite and -0.2\u2030 SMOW for dolomite), and are \n\ninterpreted as precipitating from residual waters formed during the crystallization of \n\nmethane hydrates. \n\nMaximum estimated values for seawater or pore fluids from which the minerals \n\nprecipitated were estimated from the maximum isotopic values of calcite and dolomite \n\nend-members, and for similar temperatures, correspond to similar seawater isotopic \n\ncompositions (2.8\u2030 to 5.1\u2030 SMOW for calcite and 2.0 to 4.45\u2030 SMOW for dolomite). \n\nThis is interpreted as precipitation from pore fluids formed during the destabilization of \n\nmethane hydrates. \n\nIt should be noted that there is a significant difference of about 1\u2030 SMOW for the \n\nestimated pore fluids isotopic composition from with the calcite and dolomite precipitated. \n\nThis difference was already been shown (in section 6.4.1.1) as revealed by the difference \n\nbetween the isotopic fractionation factors of the two end-members, pure calcite and pure \n\ndolomite (4.2\u2030 PDB), which is larger than the theoretical value of 3.1\u2030 PDB. Partially \n\nthis difference can be explained by the presence of two end-members in the calcite faction, \n\n(as discussed in section 6.5.2): (1) the pelagic calcite, composed by the detrital carbonate \n\nand foraminifera and cocolith tests, that corresponds to a formation in isotopic equilibrium \n\nwith normal seawater composition; and (2) the authigenic calcite that should have formed \n\nin isotopic equilibrium with the dolomite. Alternatively, this difference can also be \n\ninterpreted as reflecting a larger range of ?18Ow compositions for calcite and more \n\nrestricted optimal conditions favourable for dolomite precipitation. This is interpreted as an \n\nindication of a relatively large variability of the fluid composition during the sample \n\nformation and a different time and/or different fluid composition during the formation of \n\nthe different authigenic carbonates. As already seen in chapter 5, section 5.5.1) dolomite, \n\ncompared to the calcite and Mg-calcite, is expected to precipitate under more restricted \n\ngeochemical environments (high alkalinity and low SO42- environment conditions). The \n\noxygen isotopic data is interpreted as indicating more restricted pore water compositions \n\nthan the calcite precipitation.

Deviations of the ?18O values in bulk samples \n\nof the aragonite pavements are, to some extent, related to the respective mineral \n\ncompositions and result from the different fractionation processes associated with the \n\nformation of low Mg-calcite, high Mg-calcite and aragonite.

The relation is based on the equation given by Kim and \nO'Neil (1997). \n\n \n\nFrom Figure 6.22 and Figure 6.23, it is evident that the extrapolated average oxygen \n\nisotopic values of the end-member calcite (2.3\u2030 PDB) can be explained by the \n\nprecipitation from normal seawater composition (0-1.5\u2030 SMOW) with temperature up to \n\n10\u00baC, considering low Mg-calcite as dominant over high Mg-calcite. This would imply that \n\nfor temperatures of 11.48 \u00baC (Gardner et al., 2001) or 12.30\u00baC (Kopf et al., 2004) \n\nmeasured at the seafloor on the Hesperides MV, where aragonite pavements were retrieved \n\nfrom, the calcite end-member measurements, ranging from 2.8 to 4.0\u2030 PDB, values \n\nhigher than the average value (2.3\u2030 PDB), this would imply a precipitation from 18O-\n\nenriched pore water with a composition of at least 1.81\u2030 SMOW. This would require that \n\nthe precipitation of calcite with the estimated average isotopic composition had \n\nprecipitated from slightly 18O-enriched pore waters or precipitated at lower ambient \n\ntemperatures that the present day seabottom temperatures. However, some samples have \n\nsignificant amounts of high Mg-calcite in their carbonate composition, and one of the \n\nsamples even has 4% of dolomite in the bulk composition (Chapter 5, Table 5.1). \n\nAlternatively, the presence of Mg-calcite can justify the apparent 18O disequilibrium. \n\nAccording to Figure 6.23 the precipitation of calcite with ?18O values of 2.3\u2030 PDB can be \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 6.

However, the variability in the mineralogy composition does not \n\ntotally explain the extreme minimum and maximum values estimated for the calcite end-\n\nmember composition. The minimum value of 1.7\u2030 PDB estimated for the calcite end-\n\nmember that corresponds to the estimated isotopic composition for the calcite end-member \n\nof sample 88 in Figure 6.13 (collected from Jesus Baraza MV) corresponds to a sample \n\nwhere the low Mg-calcite to high Mg-calcite is of about 1/1. Although no temperature \n\nmeasurements were collected at the Jesus Baraza MV it is assumed that it is within the \n\ntemperature range of 8 to 12\u00baC. As such, the calcite end-member ?18O value can be \n\nexplained by precipitation from normal seawater under the present day ambient \n\ntemperatures (Table 6.6 and Figure 6.22). \n\nGiven that temperatures inferior to 4\u00baC are very improbable to occur, even \n\nconsidering glacial periods and with changes in the MO pathways and their absence at the \n\nsampling locations, the maximum limit value of 3.9\u2030 PDB on some samples can only be \n\nexplained by precipitation from heavier pore waters. Alternatively, the maximum limit \n\nvalues of 3.9\u2030 PDB of some samples could be explained by precipitation from normal \n\npore waters (?18Ow up to 1\u2030 SMOW), if the mineralogy were composed with large \n\ndominance of high Mg-calcite with high amounts of mol% of Mg. Nevertheless, this is not \n\nthe case for all the samples. Sample c.a. 106, shows the maximum estimated ?18O value of \n\n3.9\u2030 PDB was collected at the Hesperides MV and is composed of calcite 18% wt% (with \n\n3.4% mol% Mg) and high Mg-Calcite 20% wt% (with 13% mol% Mg). Mass balance \n\ncalculations would require a pore water isotopic composition ?1.0\u2030 SMOW and ambient \n\ntemperature ? 4\u00baC (very inferior to the measured temperatures 11.48\u00baC and 12.30\u00baC) to be \n\nable to precipitate a 1:1 mixture of calcite:high Mg-calcite with a isotopic composition of \n\n3.9\u2030 PDB. Considering an ambient temperature of 8\u00baC a pore water with oxygen isotopic \n\ncomposition ?2.0\u2030 SMOW would be required to precipitate a 1:1 mixture of calcite:high \n\nMg-calcite with a isotopic composition of 3.9\u2030 PDB. Considering an ambient temperature \n\nof 12\u00baC a pore water with oxygen isotopic composition ?2.8\u2030 SMOW would be required \n\nto precipitate a 1:1 mixture of calcite:high Mg-calcite with a isotopic composition of 3.9\u2030 \n\nPDB. Therefore, the maximum limit values (3.9\u2030 PDB) of this sample is interpreted as \n\nresulting of the precipitation from 18O-enriched pore waters, with ?18Ow of at least 2.0\u2030 \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 6.

As similar to the calcite and dolomite in the dolomite crusts, nodules and \n\nchimneys (section 6.5.2), the heavier pore water composition (?18Ow ? 2.0\u2030 SMOW) is \n\ninterpreted as resulting from the destabilization of gas hydrates, as it corresponds to typical \n\nreported isotopic values of pore waters resulting from the destabilization of gas hydrates \n\n(Hesse and Harrison, 1981; Davidson et al., 1983; Jenden and Gieskes, 1983). \n\n \n\n6.5.3.2 Aragonite \nThe oxygen isotopic fractionation equation of Bohm et al., (2000) defined for \n\naragonite is illustrated in Figure 6.25 for pore waters with isotopic compositions (?18Ow) \n\nranging from -2 to 4\u2030 SMOW. The expected temperature range and the calculated \n\nisotopic composition of the pure end-member aragonite phase (?18Oarg) are also plotted. In \n\nFigure 6.24 are also plotted the other oxygen isotopic fractionation equations defined for \n\naragonite and the same pore waters compositions range, temperature and pure phase \n\naragonite end-member calculated compositions as in Figure 6.25. \n\nFrom Figure 6.24 and Figure 6.25 it is evident that the extrapolated average value of \n\nthe pure aragonite end-member (4.2\u2030 PDB) can be explained by precipitation from \n\nnormal seawater, with isotopic compositions ranging from 0 to 1.5\u2030 SMOW only for \n\nambient temperatures inferior to 7.8\u00baC. Present day temperature values collected from \n\nplaces where aragonite pavements were collected indicate higher temperatures (11-12\u00baC). \n\nTherefore, the extrapolated average value of the pure aragonite end-member can reflect \n\nprecipitation during colder periods most probably when the MO was absent from the sites \n\nwhere the aragonite pavements are found and the ambient water was at least 4 \u00baC colder \n\nthan today. Alternatively these aragonite composition can be reflecting precipitation from \n18O-enriched pore waters. Considering the calculated 18O-enriched pore waters during the \n\nprecipitation of calcite mineralogy in the aragonite pavements, and considering the \n\npetrographic and textural characteristics of the aragonite pavements that indicate that the \n\nprecipitation of the authigenic carbonates occurred very close or at the seafloor, where the \n\nseawater (?18Ow ~ 0\u2030 SMOW) should clearly dominate, then the hypothesis of \n\nprecipitation of aragonite from ?18O enriched pore waters, with compositions ranging from \n\n1.1\u2030 to 2\u2030 SMOW, is interpreted as the more probable. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \nMud volcanism and fluid escape structures in the South Portuguese Margin and the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 242\n\n \n\n \n\npresent day seabottom \nwater temperature\n\nrange of extrapolated ?18O\nvalues of aragonite\n\nAverage ?18O values of aragonite\n\nfor -1\u2030 SMOW water\n\n-5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30\nTemperature (\u00baC)\n\n-5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n?1\n8 O\n\n A\nra\n\ngo\nni\n\nte\n (\n\nP\nD\n\nB\n)\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n \n\npresent day seabottom \nwater temperature\n\nrange of extrapolated ?18O\nvalues of aragonite\n\nAverage ?18O values of aragonite\n\nfor 1\u2030 SMOW water\n\n-5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30\nTemperature (\u00baC)\n\n-5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n?1\n8 O\n\n A\nra\n\ngo\nni\n\nte\n (\n\nP\nD\n\nB\n)\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n \n\npresent day seabottom \nwater temperature\n\nrange of extrapolated ?18O\nvalues of aragonite\n\nAverage ?18O values of aragonite\n\nfor 3\u2030 SMOW water\n\n-5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30\nTemperature (\u00baC)\n\n-5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n?1\n8 O\n\n A\nra\n\ngo\nni\n\nte\n (\n\nP\nD\n\nB\n)\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n \nFigure 6.24.

The estimated minimum \n\noxygen isotopic values of the seawater or pore fluids, from which the pure phase end-\n\nmembers calcite and aragonite precipitated from, indicate a composition close to normal \n\nseawater values for the most probable temperature interval considered (more than -0.5\u2030 \n\nSMOW for more than 4\u00baC for calcite and more than 0\u2030 SMOW for more than 4\u00baC for \n\naragonite). The estimated maximum oxygen isotopic values of the seawater or pore fluids \n\nfrom which the pore phase end-members calcite and aragonite had precipitated indicate 18O \n\nenriched pore fluids composition, even considering the lower assumed temperature limit of \n\n4\u00baC. This is interpreted as indicating (especially for aragonite) a precipitation from pore \n\nfluids formed during the destabilization of methane hydrates. The estimated average \n\noxygen isotopic values of the seawater or pore fluids from which the pore phase end-\n\nmembers calcite and aragonite precipitated also indicates that aragonite had precipitated \n\nfrom a more 18O enriched pore fluid composition that the calcite phase. \n\nAn estimated ?18O of pure aragonite end-member mineral yields on average 4.2\u2030 \n\n(PDB), whereas 18O is strongly lighter in the pure calcite end-member (2.3\u2030 Figure 6.13). \n\nThe difference between the two carbonate phases (1.9\u2030) is larger than the expected value \n\ndue to the differences in the oxygen isotopic fractionation ?18Oarag-calc value of 1.4\u2030, \n\naccording to Figure 6.5. As seen in section 6.5.2.3, as discussed for the apparent non \n\nequilibrium between the calcite and dolomite phases in the dolomite crusts, chimneys and \n\nnodules, the larger difference (1.9\u2030) in the isotopic fractionation between calcite and \n\naragonite can be due to the pelagic contribution of the detrital calcite and mainly from the \n\nforaminifera and cocoliths tests that represent isotopic compositions in equilibrium with \n\nnormal seawater compositions and that have the effect of lowering the global isotopic \n\ncomposition of the total calcite phase. Admitting that both mineralogies were precipitated \n\nin or close to isotopic equilibrium with the pore fluids from which they precipitated, this \n\nimplies that the calcite and the aragonite precipitation occurs in slightly different \n\nenvironmental conditions, most probably considerably different temperature and/or ?18O \n\nisotopic composition of the pore water fluids. Alternatively, if the effect of the pelagic \n\ncalcite fraction is ignored, then for the same temperatures, the estimated oxygen isotopic \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 6.

This is interpreted as one of the reasons \n\nfor the observed difference of 1.9\u2030 PDB (Figure 6.13) between the calcite and aragonite \n\nisotopic fractionation factors (?18Oarag-cal) that is higher than the expected theoretical \n\ndifference of 1.4\u2030 (PDB) (Section 6.1.4.4, Figure 6.5). Therefore, the precipitation of \n\ncalcite and aragonite can alternatively be occurring, at similar temperatures but from pore \n\nfluids with slightly different oxygen isotopic compositions, with aragonite precipitating \n\nfrom an more 18O-enriched (0.5 to 0.6\u2030) pore fluids that the calcite. \n\n \nTable 6.6.

The stromatolitic fabric, the presence of \n\nbotryoidal textures composed of almost pure aragonite mineralogy, both infilling mega-\n\npores and cavities are interpreted as resulting from aragonite precipitation in association \n\nwith gas hydrates, similar to the descriptions of several other cold seeps MDAC \n\n(Bohrmann et al., 1998; Greinert et al., 2001). The structure of the intraformational \n\nbreccias is interpreted as resulting from gas hydrate growth and decomposition, mechanism \n\ninterpreted to be the responsible for the collapse and breccification of pre-existing crusts \n\nand pavements. Subsequent re-cementation produced the intraformational breccias. Both \n\nthese evidences support the interpretation that the oxygen isotopic composition of the \n\ncarbonates reflects, at least for some samples, the influence of gas hydrates decomposition \n\non the formation of calcite and specially aragonite authigenic minerals of the aragonite \n\npavements. \n\nThe dominance of aragonite in the matrix, occurring as pure aragonite stromatolitic \n\nlayers and botryoids, that from the underwater observations that indicate their occurrence \n\nat the seafloor (Chapter 8) and the gas hydrate fabrics are interpreted as indicating a near-\n\nsurface origin of the aragonite pavements. Here, the geochemical conditions with high \n\nalkalinity and higher sulphate concentrations stimulate aragonite precipitation (Burton, \n\n1993; Savard et al., 1996). The high alkalinity is interpreted as resulting from high \n\nmethane oxidation rates, consequence of high methane concentrations from gas hydrate \n\ndestabilization and high sulphate concentration from the intense seawater ventilation. \n\nCalcite formation is favoured at relatively lower alkalinity and lower sulphate \n\nconcentrations, indicating an intra-sediment environment, with 18O-enriched pore water. \n\nSuch conditions are suggested to be present after the decomposition of gas hydrates or in \n\nmethane rich sediments, in a less ventilated environment as in intra-sediment environment \n\nwhere the sulphate has been partially consumed for the oxidation of the hydrate-methane \n\nvia sulphate reduction and is not restored. If this mechanism evolves to a more confine \n\nsystem, most probably at a micro environmental scale, in consequence of the progressive \n\ncementation, it can lead to the total sulphate consumption and in cases of high alkalinity, \n\nprobably after significant Ca removal during intense calcite and aragonite precipitation, \n\nthese conditions can lead to the precipitation of high Mg-calcite or even to dolomite, in the \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 6.

The smaller interval of variation of the estimated pore water \n\ncomposition of the aragonite pavements is interpreted as reflecting the more proximal and \n\nintense influence of seawater. The larger interval of variation of the estimated pore water \n\ncomposition of the dolomite chimneys is interpreted as reflecting a more distant and \n\nconfined environment where the pore waters are able to evolve and differ more intensely \n\naway from the normal seawater isotopic composition. \n\n \n\n6.6 Conclusions \n\n \n\nConsidering the present day temperature (ranging from 8 to 12 \u00baC) and the extreme \n\nlimits for temperature variation, considering the oxygen isotopic composition of the Gulf \n\nof Cadiz bottom water both for the NADW and the MO, and assuming that the oxygen \n\nisotopic ratio variations are the typical between glacial and interglacial stages, within the \n\nrange from +0.5 to +1.5\u2030 SMOW, the isotopic composition of the original fluids from \n\nwhich the carbonates were precipitated were estimated according to the different mineral \n\ntemperature of precipitation equations. Considering the minimum and maximum \n\ntemperature limits, admitted to be possible to occur at these sites, not all the measured \n\ncarbonate isotopic values are compatible with precipitation from normal seawater isotopic \n\ncomposition.  \n\nAragonite pavements are estimated to be formed from normal seawater oxygen \n\nisotopic compositions and from a 18O-enriched pore waters indicating a contribution from \n\ndissociated gas hydrates. The aragonite pavement samples indicate a formation in \n\nenvironments near or at the sediment seawater interface, while the dolomite chimneys \n\nindicate a formation in more confined within the sediment column. The dolomite chimneys \n\nindicate formation conditions similar normal seawater and destabilization of gas hydrates \n\nbut they also indicate precipitation from pore waters during gas hydrates formation. \n\nThe 87Sr/86Sr ratios of the analyses of authigenic carbonates do not indicate a clear \n\nand major addition of Sr from deep seated fluids, but they preferably reflect the \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 6.

U/Th Ages of dolomite chimneys from the Gulf of \nCadiz: record of intense past fluid escape episodes \n\n \n\n \n\n7.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nThe high abundance of fluid escape structures in the Gulf of Cadiz, expressed as mud \n\nvolcanoes, mud diapirs, pockmarks, active seepage, modern and fossil cold seepage \n\nrecorded by the precipitation methane-derived authigenic carbonates (MDAC), is an \n\nindicator that fluid seepage has been an active process in this area in the present and past \n\ngeological record (e.g. Somoza et al., 2002; D\u00edaz-del-R\u00edo et al., 2003; Magalh\u00e3es et al., \n\n2003; Pinheiro et al., 2003; Somoza et al., 2003; Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2004; Rensbergen et al., \n\n2005).  \n\nSeveral hydrocarbon-rich fluid seepage indicators can be considered in the geologic \n\nrecord. Amongst those indicators, the more important are the MDAC that typically exhibit \n\nhighly negative carbon isotopic signatures, with ?13C values ranging from -10 to -90\u2030 \n\nVPDB (Vienna Peedee Belemnite), depending on the microbial or thermogenic source \n\norigin of the methane. The carbon and oxygen isotopic signals from MDAC recovered \n\nfrom seepage areas are now being extensively used to investigate past fluid escape and \n\nepisodes of gas hydrate destabilization in marine sediments (Dickens et al., 1995; Hesselbo \n\net al., 2000; Krull and Retallack, 2000; Krull et al., 2000). While there is still a discussion \n\nwhether the ?13C signature in seep benthic foraminifera really reflects the surrounding pore \n\nwater composition from which they have precipitated or if it was acquired later, after \n\ndeposition, during diagenesis (Torres et al., 2003; Martin et al., 2004), the negative ?13C \n\nexcursions recorded by benthic foraminiferal shells in cold seep sediments have been \n\ninterpreted as indicating methane release episodes (Hill et al., 2004; Mackensen et al., \n\n2006) some of these, proposed to be related with methane hydrate dissociation (e.g. \n\nDickens et al., 1997; Kennett et al., 2000, 2003). Hydrocarbon seepage is also marked by \n\n\n\nChapter 7. U/Th Ages of dolomite chimneys from the Gulf of Cadiz: record of intense past fluid \nescape episodes \n\n 252 \n\nchemosynthetic communities like particular species of bivalves, tube worms and bacterial \n\nmats that derive their energy from the oxidation of advected reduced elements and/or \n\nhydrocarbon compounds (Sibuet and Olu, 1998).  \n\nIn the Gulf of Cadiz, MDAC occur as seafloor crusts, pavements, build-ups, \n\nconcretions, and conduit or chimney-like forms, and are associated with seepage of \n\nhydrocarbon-rich fluids (mainly methane, as discussed in Chapters 5 and 6). Their \n\nformation is triggered by the increase of alkalinity during anaerobic methane oxidation \n\n(AOM), coupled with sulphate reduction (SR) (e.g. Hovland et al., 1987; Ritger et al., \n\n1987; Hovland and Judd, 1988; Paull et al., 1992) in a process mediated by microbial \n\nactivity (Boetius et al., 2000). The mineralogy of these carbonates (aragonite, calcite, Mg-\n\ncalcite, protodolomite and dolomite) records different geochemical and diagenetic \n\nenvironments during their formation process. In particular, there is clear evidence that the \n\nformation of some of these MDAC is associated with the dissociation of gas hydrates \n\n(Chapter 6), given the abnormal positive ?18O values of the constituent authigenic \n\ncarbonate minerals. \n\nTherefore, past fluid flow and gas hydrate formation/dissociation episodes can be \n\nreconstructed from the MDAC (e.g. Bohrmann et al., 1998; Greinert et al., 2001). \n\nAmongst all the different seepage structures, MDAC are those that probably better record \n\nthe seepage activity at cold seeps. They can potentially record the fluid flow intensity, \n\nwhether the fluid flow venting is a continuous process or if it occurs discontinuously, and \n\nthe timing and age of the seeping episodes. Absolute dating of the MDAC can therefore \n\nprovide the means for reconstructing the past fluid escape episodes, their frequency and \n\nevolution through time. Dating of the MDAC is also essential to constrain the external \n\nfactors that can actively control the fluid flow and its intensity, such as tectonic events, \n\nmass-wasting processes, sea-level variations, gas hydrate formation/destabilisation, and \n\nalso to assess the potential impact and significance of these processes in global climate \n\nchange. \n\nConventional 14C dating techniques are not applicable to MDAC, as their carbon \n\nderives partially from thermogenic, old methane. The most suitable dating technique, also \n\nfavourable due to its larger time window, is the U/Th dating technique, that was \n\nsuccessfully applied to authigenic carbonates from the Hydrate Ridge (Teichert et al., \n\n2003). The 230Th-234U-238U system as also been proven to be adequate for dating a variety \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 253\n\nof materials from Late Pleistocene to Holocene age (Broecker, 1963; Broecker et al., \n\n1968). Therefore, U/Th dating was employed here for the age determination of selected \n\nsamples from MDAC dolomite chimneys from the Gulf of Cadiz. \n\nIn the following section, the analytical procedure developed with the objective of \n\ndate the MDAC samples from the Gulf of Cadiz is described. The analytical processes and \n\nthe age determination were performed at the IFM-Geomar in Kiel (Germany), during an \n\nauthor visit from October 25th to November 06th in 2004. The various U/Th dating \n\napproaches are also presented in this chapter, and their results discussed with the objective \n\nof reconstructing past fluid flow episodes and possible processes that might have \n\ncontrolled the formation of the MDAC. \n\n \n\n7.2 Materials and methods \n\n7.2.1 Samples used \n\nIn this work, two MDAC samples (3463-A03 and 3463-A08) were selected for \n\ndating (Table 7.1 and Figure 7.2). Both samples were collected by dredging on the Cadiz \n\nChannel, to the west of the Iberico mud cone during the TTR11 cruise, station TTR11-\n\nAT339D (Kenyon et al., 2002). This sampling site is located on the pathway of the lower \n\ncore of the Mediterranean Outflow (Figure 7.1.B), which flows in direct contact with the \n\nseafloor, producing a strong erosive effect, as discussed in Chapter 4. The selected samples \n\nfor U/Th analysis belong to the dolomite chimneys type, as defined in Chapter 5. Sample \n\n3463-A03 was taken from a chimney with two parallel cemented conduits with no internal \n\nopen vent channels and with distinct concentric growth layers around the two cemented \n\nconduit axes. Sub-samples for age determination were collected at the centre of each of the \n\nconduit axes and in intermediate layers, in order to evaluate if the different axes \n\ncorrespond to separate or the same formation episode. Sample 3463-A08 as taken from a \n\nchimney with an open central vent channel, very homogeneous, with no detected \n\nconcentric growth layers neither any longitudinal textural discontinuity along the chimney. \n\nBoth samples were selected because of their mineral composition, with more than 65% of \n\ncarbonate (Dolomite: 54 to 78%; Calcite: 3 to 13%), and because they show little or no \n\noxidation, as revealed by their pale-yellow to pale-grey colours. This is interpreted as \n\nindicating that these chimneys were exposed to the seawater during a period of time not \n\n\n\nChapter 7.

While sample 3463-A03 corresponds to a cemented sand-siltstone (Figure \n\n7.3) with the detrital fraction being composed by sand to silty dominated terrigenous \n\nmatrix and abundant bioclasts, sample 3463-A08 corresponds to a mud-wackstone with a \n\ndetrital fraction composed mainly by clay fraction. Therefore, sediments that were on the \n\norigin of sample 3463-A03 have higher initial porosity and therefore higher initial \n\npermeability; the sample 3463-A08 has lower initial porosity and lower permeability. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 7.3.

Therefore \n\nthe initial permeability of sample 3463-A03 is much higher than sample 3463-A08. \n\n \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 257\n\n \n\n7.2.2.2 XRD results \n\nSemiquantitative abundance of the carbonate phases and mineralogical composition \n\nof the analysed samples was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) at the ETH Centre in \n\nZurich, according to the methodology described in chapter 5, section 3.

The \n\nestimated ?13C of pure phases, calcite and dolomite, was calculated based on the isotopic \n\nfractionation equation defined by all the sample dataset, according to figure 6.12 (chapter \n\n6). Theoretical ?18O compositions for pure calcite and dolomite phases were calculated for \n\nthe present day temperature at the sampling sites (11\u00baC), estimated from the CANIGO \n\nCTD dataset (Ambar et al., 2002), as plotted in Figure 7.1, and the ?18OSMOW isotopic \n\nvalues of seawater collected from the lower core of the Mediterranean Outflow (MO) at \n\n\n\nChapter 7.

(1986) and Edwards et al. (1987). \n\nApproximately 30 mg of sample material was collected by hand-drilling. Powdered \n\nsamples were dissolved with HNO3 acid until all carbonate was dissolved and spiked with \n\n120 \u00b5l of spike MIX 6, centrifuged, and the solution evaporated in a hot plate (90\u00baC) \n\novernight. It was then dissolved in 1N HC1, and 8 mg of Fe in chloride solution was \n\nadded. The U and Th were then co-precipitated with the Fe by the addition of ammonium \n\nhydroxide until the color of the solution changed from yellow to clear. The mixture was \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 259\n\ncentrifuged and the supernatant discarded. The residue was then rinsed twice with distilled \n\nwater, dissolved in concentrated HNO3, dried and re-dissolved in concentrated HNO3 \n\ntwice, dried and dissolved in 0.5 ml of 7N HNO3. This solution was loaded on an anion \n\nexchange column (Dowex AG 1 \u00d7 8 resin) with a volume of 0.5 ml previously washed \n\nwith mili-Q water, HNO3-H2O (1:1), HCl 6N, and mili-Q water. Fe was eluted using 7N \n\nHNO3. The Th fraction was then eluted with 6N HCl and the U fraction with 1N HBr. The \n\nU fraction was dried three times and dissolved in 0.1N HNO3. An aliquot, containing ~ 3x \n\n1010 atoms of 234U, was loaded on a graphite-coated zone refined Re filament. The Th \n\nfraction was further purified by drying it, dissolving it in HNO3, drying it again, and \n\ndissolving it in 0.15 ml of 7N HNO3. This solution was loaded on a column similar to the \n\nfirst column used but with a volume of 0.15 ml. A similar elution scheme was followed. \n\nThe subsequent Th fraction was dried and dissolved in 0.1N HNO3. \n\nThree analytical blanks, one ~100 mg of LICS, and a standard solution of HU1 with \n\na proportion of U-Th of 1:1 were submitted to the same sample preparation methodology \n\nand measured with the samples for control. U and Th isotope measurements were \n\nperformed with a 233U/236U double spike and a 229Th single spike by Thermal Ionisation \n\nMass Spectrometry (TIMS) on a Finnigan MAT 262 RPQ, at IFM-Geomar in Kiel, \n\nGermany. \n\n \n\n7.3 Results and Discussion \n\n7.3.1 Constrains on the origin of the uranium in the MDAC \n\nThe U concentration in the carbonates depends on many factors, such as the U \n\nconcentration on the precipitation fluids, the mineralogy, the mineral morphology, the \n\ntemperature, and the geochemical conditions during mineral formation (Shen and Dunbar, \n\n1995). The average U concentrations of the analysed MDAC are higher than the average \n\nvalue for modern seawater (Figure 7.4). Within the two chimney samples the U \n\nconcentrations vary significativelly. Sample 3463-A03 has similar values for the different \n\nsub-samples, from 0.64 to 3.24 \u00b5g/g, while the sub-samples from sample 3463-A08 show a \n\nlarger variation of U concentration values, ranging from 0.26 to 28.10 \u00b5g/g (Figure 7.4 and \n\nTable 7.4). Sample 3463-A03 shows very similar ?234U values for the different sub-\n\nsamples and sample 3463-A08 has a larger dispersion of the sub-sample values. Sub-\n\n\n\nChapter 7. U/Th Ages of dolomite chimneys from the Gulf of Cadiz: record of intense past fluid \nescape episodes \n\n 260 \n\nsamples 3 and 5 of chimney 3463-A08 have abnormal high U concentrations, although \n\nabnormal mineral content was not detected on the XRD analysis; a detrital contribution \n\nmay explain these high U values. Alternatively, high U concentrations on these sub-\n\nsamples can result from an abnormal U content in the fluids from which these carbonates \n\nprecipitated from. Although not statistically significant, these two sub-samples were \n\ncollected closer to the open conduit of fluid percolation, and therefore may correspond to a \n\nmore intense fluid composition signal. It should be noted that chimney 3463-A08 presents \n\na much wider range of U concentration and ?234U values in its sub-samples than chimney \n\n3463-A03 (Figure 7.6). Although sample 3463-A08 represents a shorter formation time-\n\nspan than chimney 3463-A03 (see section 7.3.2), this can be interpreted as indicating a \n\nmuch more variable fluid composition during the time-span corresponding to the formation \n\nof the chimney 3463-A08. \n\nAs concerns ?234U values, all sub-samples in sample 3463-A03 have lower ?234U \n\nvalues than seawater (Figure 7.5). Again, sample 3463-A08 shows highly variable ?234U \n\nvalues, with sub-samples 3, 4 and 5 showing lower ?234U values than seawater but, with \n\nsub-samples 1 and 2 showing higher ?234U values than seawater (Figure 7.5). \n\nU is highly soluble in oxic conditions and highly insoluble under anoxic conditions \n\n(Barnes and Cochran, 1990). Therefore, the U concentration of the dolomite chimneys that \n\nare formed as a result of AOM (chapter 5 and 6), i.e. precipitated from anoxic pore waters, \n\nare expected to have lower U concentrations than the authigenic carbonates precipitated \n\nfrom bottom waters, such as the aragonite-dominated MDAC or corals. The uranium \n\nconcentration of pure aragonite (>97 wt.% aragonite) chemoherm carbonates reported by \n\nTeichert et al., (2003), that are considered as being formed in highly seawater ventilated \n\nenvironments, most probably at or very close to the sediment/seawater interface (very \n\nsimilar to the aragonite pavement samples described in chapter 5), have mean U \n\nconcentrations of 5.2 \u00b1 0.8 \u00b5g/g. Modern (D. cristagalli) and fossil corals have reported \n\naverage U concentration values of 3.85 and 3.78 \u00b5g/g, respectively (Cheng et al., 2000). \n\nThese reported chemoherm and coral U concentration values are higher than the measured \n\nvalues of the analysed samples in this study (Figure 7.4) (with the exception of sub-\n\nsamples 3 and 5 in sample 3463-A08, discussed above), supporting the formation model of \n\nthe dolomite chimneys in an anoxic environment within the sedimentary column, as \n\ndiscussed in Chapter 5. \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 261\n\n3463-A08\n\n3463-A03\n\nSeawater Authigenic carbonatesC\nor\n\nal\ns\n\n0 0.004 5 10 15 20 25 30\nUconcentration (\u00b5g/g)\n\n6 78910\n\n12 34 5\n\n \nFigure 7.4.

U/Th Ages of dolomite chimneys from the Gulf of Cadiz: record of intense past fluid \nescape episodes \n\n 262 \n\n \n\nThe U concentrations and the ?234U values of the authigenic carbonates are \n\ndependent on the U concentration and the ?234U composition of the fluids from which they \n\nprecipitated from, but may also vary with several chemical factors, such as the redox \n\nconditions during the carbonate formation (Teichert et al., 2003). In order to investigate if \n\nthe seawater has an important contribution to the U fluid composition of the two analysed \n\ncarbonates, the uranium concentration was plotted against the ?234U ratios in Figure 7.6. \n\nThe U concentration as a function of ?234U values of the analysed sub-samples of the \n\ntwo samples define two trend lines that are interpreted as representing mixing lines \n\nbetween different end-members. The slopes of the mixing lines depend on the composition \n\nof the fluids from which the authigenic carbonate precipitated, which may contain varying \n\namounts of pore water fluids, methane rich fluids, and seawater. Most probably, two \n\nimportant contributions correspond to the pore water and the methane rich fluids. The \n\nseawater contribution is not a clear important end-member, as the two trend lines do not \n\npoint to the seawater composition (Figure 7.6).  \n\nConsidering this simplified model, it is possible to propose that sample 3463-A03 \n\nrepresents a carbonate precipitation from anoxic pore water fluids with a mixture of an \n\nenriched 234U fluid with a more depleted 234U fluid, both with a fairly constant ?234U \n\ncomposition. Sample 3463-A08, in contrast would represent a precipitation from a fluid \n\nthat corresponds to a mixture of a low 234U concentration and low ?234U fluid, with a more \n\nenriched ?234U and higher concentration 234U fluid. Sample 3463-A03 points to an end-\n\nmember composition close to the seawater composition. As this sample has a larger \n\naverage grain size and therefore corresponds to lithified sediments with an original higher \n\nporosity and higher permeability, it is interpreted that, on this sample, the pore water and \n\nthe seawater contribution is more important than on sample 3463-A08, which corresponds \n\nto a cemented mudstone with very low initial porosity and low permeability. \n\n \n\n7.3.2 Age determination \n\nThe U/Th dating method is based on the Th insolubility leading that the carbonates \n\nprecipitated from solution are free of Th but may contain U. Known the 230Th and 234U \n\ndecay constants, the age of the carbonate phases can be calculated from the 230Th/234U and \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 263\n\n234U/238U activity ratios, according to the equation: \n\n[ ] [ ] [ ]tUUtUUUTh )exp(1)/1()/()exp(1)/(/ 042342384000234238234230 ?????? ??\u00d7?\u00d7?+??=  \nWhere 0?  and 4?  are the decay constants for \n\n230Th and 234U, respectively, and t  is \n\nthe age. \n\nHowever, natural carbonate samples (such as the studied MDAC samples) contain \n\ndetrital material of variable origin such as terrigenous fractions and clay minerals that can \n\ncontribute with significant amounts of 230Th and 234U to the total sample, resulting in \n\ndeviations of the observed 230Th/234U ratio from that of the authigenically precipitated \n\ncarbonate component alone, and if not corrected for, produces apparent erroneous age \n\nvalues. Various methods have been proposed to \u201ccorrect\u201d this detritus contamination. On \n\nthis study, individual sub-sample ages were obtained by correcting the analysis of a single \n\nleachate for its contaminant 230Th.

U/Th Ages of dolomite chimneys from the Gulf of Cadiz: record of intense past fluid \nescape episodes \n\n 264 \n\nMost of the samples have low 230Th/232Th activity ratios (<20, with the exception of \n\nsamples 3 and 5), and therefore corrections for the inherited 230Th were done using the \n230Th, 232Th and ?238U activities to extrapolate the detritus contribution. It should be noted \n\nthat the term detritus used here deviates from its sedimentological definition. The detritus \n\nphase here refers to all phases bearing Th isotopes initially incorporated into the sample. \n\nThe U-series datation method is based on the large difference in solubility between U and \n\nTh. In most of the systems, such as the authigenic carbonate phases precipitation from \n\nnatural solutions, they will have very low 232Th/238U and 230Th/238U ratios. The 230Th \n\ngrowth method for dating these carbonate phases may be employed with confidence by \n\nassuming 230Th/234U = 0, at the time of formation. This is only possible in the cases in \n\nwhich the authigenic phases that contain U are essentially free of 232Th. In the case of the \n\nanalysed MDAC samples, which contain significant amounts of non-authigenic carbonate \n\nminerals, such as biogenic fragments, quartz, feldspars and clays (15 to 35%), it should be \n\nexpected the presence of non free 232Th from those allochtonous minerals. Therefore, the \n\ncorrections to the initial 230Th, 238U and 234U have to be made assuming that it is \n\naccompanied by the 232Th. Therefore, the correction value of the detritus 230Th contribution \n\nis assumed to be equal to the 232Th concentration. \n\nThe isochron method is the common approach to solve this problem. By analyzing \n\nthree or more co-genetic samples with variable 238U/232Th, it is possible to extrapolate the \n232Th-free end-member isotopic ratios from a least-squares regression of the data on a pair \n\nof isotope-ratio diagrams that completely define the 238U-234U-230Th-232Th system. The \n\nisochron method allows the definition of the detrital correction from the several sub-\n\nsamples of each chimney. Since five sub-samples of each sample were analysed, and \n\nassuming that the chimneys were formed rapidly, compared with their ages, the five co-\n\ngenetic sub-samples have different authigenic carbonate/detritus ratios and so, variable \n230Th-234U-238U isotope ratios. Four pairs of isotope-ratio or isochron diagrams could be \n\nused (Ludwig and Titterington, 1994): (1) the Rosholt type I isochron diagrams: \n230Th/232Th - 234U/232Th and 234U/232Th - 238U/232Th; (2) the Osmond type I isochron \n\ndiagrams: 230Th/234U - 232Th/234U and 234U/238U - 232Th/238U; (3) the Rosholt type II \n\nisochron diagrams: 230Th/232Th - 238U/232Th and 234U/232Th - 238U/232Th; and (4) the \n\nOsmond type II isochron diagrams: 230Th/238U - 232Th/238U and 234U/238U - 232Th/238U. \n\n \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 265\n\nC\nen\n\ntr\ne \n\nof\n c\n\non\ndu\n\nit \n2\n\nC\nen\n\ntr\ne \n\nof\n c\n\non\ndu\n\nit \n1\n\nRelative Position\n\n275\n\n250\n\n225\n\n200\n\n175\n\n150\n\n125\n\n100\n\n75\n\n50\n\n275\n\n250\n\n225\n\n200\n\n175\n\n150\n\n125\n\n100\n\n75\n\n50\n\nA\nge\n\n (k\na)\n\n3463-A03\n\nB\not\n\nto\nm\n\n, C\nen\n\ntr\ne\n\nIn\nte\n\nrm\ned\n\nia\n\nT\nop\n\n, p\ner\n\nip\nhe\n\nry\n\nRelative Position\n\n275\n\n250\n\n225\n\n200\n\n175\n\n150\n\n125\n\n100\n\n75\n\n50\n\nA\nge\n\n (k\na)\n\n3463-A08\n\n \nFigure 7.7. U/Th ages determined along radial and longitudinal profiles on the analysed samples. \n\n \n\nIn this study, the 232Th-free end-member, from which the age is calculated from, is \n\ngiven by either the slope in the Rosholt diagrams or by the intercept in the Osmond \n\ndiagrams. It should be noted that analytical errors produce a scattering of the points around \n\nthe theoretical strait lines. Additionally, scattering can also result from uranium and \n\nthorium open-system behaviour and/or the presence of multiple end-members. \n\nIn the isochron diagrams (Figure 7.8, Figure 7.9 and Figure 7.10), the mixing lines \n\nbetween any two components are strait lines with fairly good correlation coefficients, \n\nindicating that the assumed conditions for the use of this technique are adequate. The \n\nRosholt isochrones for both samples show good correlation coefficients (0.999). The \n\nOsmond isochrones show a good correlation coefficient for sample 3463-A08 (0.95 and \n\n0.71) but a more deficient correlation for sample 3463-A03 (0.71 and 0.36). This indicates \n\nthat the assumed considerations are respected to a high degree for sample 3463-A08, but \n\nnot so well for sample 3463-A03 and therefore the calculated ages with the isochron \n\nmethods are reliable and the ages estimated by this method are expected to be closer to the \n\nreal age of the pure authigenic carbonate phases. \n\nThe Osmond isochrones indicate a mean age of 360 ka for chimney 3463-A03 and a \n\nmean age of 247.8 ka for chimney 3463-A08, which is also very close to the ages \n\ndetermined for the sub-samples. \n\n\n\nChapter 7.

This \n\nindicates a short formation time-span of ~4 ka \u00b1 50 ka, consistent with the homogeneous \n\ncharacter of this sample. The estimated ages, while having associated considerable error \n\nvalues are statistically significant, indicating that the formation of the chimney occurs \n\nduring a short episode of enhanced precipitation, indicating a high rate of carbonate \n\nformation (1 cm/ka). Given its textural homogeneity, this chimney was, most probably, \n\nformed continuously. Given that sub-samples 3, 4 and 5 were collected from a equal \n\ndistance from the chimney centre, it is possible to propose that the growth of the chimney \n\nproceeds from the centre to the periphery. \n\nThe Osmond isochron age estimated for sample 3463-A08 is in very good agreement \n\nwith the individual ages of the sub-samples (Table 7.4, Table 7.5 and Figure 7.11). The \n\ngood linear correlation of the trend lines defined by the isochron techniques (Figure 7.8 to \n\nFigure 7.10) point to a good estimation of the ages by the isochon technique.  \n\n \n\n7.3.2.2 Sample 3463-A03 \n\nSub-samples collected along a radial profile in sample 3463-A03 yielded ages \n\nranging from 89 ka to 221 ka (Table 7.4 and Figure 7.11). Sample 3463-A03 corresponds \n\nto a chimney with two cemented parallel conduits. The centre of conduit 1 has an estimated \n\nage of 221 ka and a growing direction from the centre of the conduit to the periphery, with \n\nsubsequent enlargement episodes (continuous or discontinuous). Conduit 2 has an \n\nestimated age of 89 ka and indicates an apparent growing direction from the exterior to the \n\ncentre of the conduit. The ages of the sample as their heterogeneous texture indicates that \n\nthe formation of the sample was, most probably, episodically, with a first fluid flow \n\nepisode that induced the precipitation of conduit 1. Carbonate precipitation progressed \n\nradially from this conduit (most probably by discontinuous episodes). A latter fluid episode \n\nresulted in the precipitation of conduit 2. The grow rate on this sample is vary variable \n\nranging from 2.6 mm/ka, considering just the conduit 1 zone (segment between sub-\n\nsamples 6 and 7) to 0.6 mm/ka, considering the zone between the centre of the two \n\nconduits (sub-samples 7 and 10). \n\n\n\nChapter 7. U/Th Ages of dolomite chimneys from the Gulf of Cadiz: record of intense past fluid \nescape episodes \n\n 270 \n\nThe age estimated by the Osmond isochron method for this sample indicates an age \n\nof 360 ka, with a lower limit of 243 ka and the maximum limit indicates more than 500 ka \n\n(Table 7.5 and Figure 7.9), above the upper limit of this dating technique. The discrepancy \n\nbetween the isochrone age and the 230Th/234U ages of the different sub-samples is \n\ninterpreted as resulting from the large time span along which the sample was formed, i.e. \n\nthe condition of application of the isochron technique that the samples were formed in a \n\nshort period of time compared to their age is not adequately verified. The period of \n\nformation (221 to 89 ka) represents a significant time span compared with the age of the \n\nsample (at least 60% of the maximum age). This is also reflected by the lower correlation \n\ncoefficient of the isochon trend lines of sample 3463-A03 compared with sample 3463-\n\nA08 (Figure 7.8 to Figure 7.10). \n\n \n\n7.3.2.3 Samples 3463-A03 and 3463-A08  \n\nAs seen in chapters 5 and 6, the precipitation of the authigenic carbonates in the Gulf \n\nof Cadiz is closely linked with the supply of methane-rich fluids. The estimated ages \n\nindicate that during this interval, favourable conditions for enhanced methane flux \n\nthroughout the sediments, and consequently carbonate precipitation, occur at specific time \n\nintervals. The estimated ages of the two samples indicate that the carbonate precipitation \n\nand the dolomite chimney formation occur in distinct intervals or episodes. These episodes \n\noccur in the same geological setting and within very closely spaced locations, and are \n\ninterpreted as indicating that the fluid escape processes within this area of the Gulf of \n\nCadiz has occurred during a long time-span (at least 150 ka), but the precipitation of the \n\ndifferent samples occurs in shorter episodes. Most probably, there is an edification of a \n\ncomplex plumbing system along which the carbonate chimneys are formed. The plumbing \n\nsystem most probably would show global and local variability of the fluid flow intensity. \n\nThe seepage intensity can have episodes of high intense flux and locally the flux can be \n\nlocalized and have spatial migrations. Some fluid conduits can be interrupted by complete \n\nclog of the fluid conduits as a result of carbonate cementation, or if the flux along them is \n\ndiminished or deviated to other pathways and resumed latter, giving place to the formation \n\nof secondary conduits, such as those represented by sample 3463-A03. Variations in the \n\nregional tectonic stress field would correspond to changes with larger time scale periods; \n\nhowever it is possible to speculate that earthquakes and smaller scale tectonic stress regime \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 271\n\nchanges may produce the opening, enlargement or closure of different conduits for the \n\nsupply of methane-rich fluids. Those small scale stress readjustments can have variations \n\nin the same time scale period of formation of the samples. In addition, sealevel variations, \n\nrelated to glacial-interglacial fluctuations, which have a time scale cyclicity of 100 ka, will \n\nmost probably have significant control on the fluid flow regime and intensity in the upper \n\nportion of the sedimentary column. Therefore, the potential regional paleoceanographic \n\ncontrol on the enhanced fluid flow episodes is investigated in the next section. \n\n \n\n \n\n100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500\n\nAge (ka)\n\n3463-A08\n\n3463-A03\n\nIsochron Age\n\nIsochron Age\n76\n\n9\n\n810\n\n \nFigure 7.11. 230Th/234U ages of individual sub-samples and isochron ages determined by the Osmond \n\nisochron method. \n\n \n\n \n\n7.3.3 230Th/234U ages of the MDAC and their relationship to the global \n\nsealevel record \n\nOver the time scale of glacial-interglacial cycles, the corresponding sealevel \n\nvariations may significantly influence fluid flow in continental margins.

U/Th Ages of dolomite chimneys from the Gulf of Cadiz: record of intense past fluid \nescape episodes \n\n 272 \n\nconsequent lowering of pressure would shift the bottom of the gas hydrate stability zone \n\ninto shallower depths and consequently promote the dissociation of the existing gas \n\nhydrates. The enhanced decomposition of gas hydrates may then generate enhanced gas \n\nand fluid flow in cold seep areas, leading to an increased precipitation of methane-derived \n\nauthigenic carbonates (as described in chapter 6). In addition, the decomposition of gas \n\nhydrates, as a consequence of the changes in the gas hydrate stability zone, releases \n\nconsiderable amounts of fresh water into the sediment pore space, thereby increasing the \n\nnegative pressure gradient between the pore fluids and the seawater column, enhancing the \n\nfluid flow. For active fluid seepage, it is most crucial that the hydraulic pressure of the \n\nascending fluids in the plumbing system within the sediments exceeds the pressure of the \n\noverlying seawater column, that corresponds to the sealevel (Carson and Screaton, 1998). \n\nTherefore, two scenarios can be distinguished when considering pore water pressure \n\nchanges due to sealevel variations: (1) the seawater pressure exceeds the hydraulic pressure \n\nof the plumbing system below a methane fluid seepage site, inhibiting the rise of fluids; (2) \n\nthe seawater pressure is lower than the hydraulic pressure of the plumbing system and \n\nvigorous fluid seepage occurs. It is therefore possible to propose that during glacial stages, \n\nwhich correspond to low sealevel, a negative pressure gradient is established between the \n\npore water fluids or the plumbing system and the seawater pressure, triggering or leading \n\nto maximum fluid flow rates at methane seep sites, enhancing the precipitation of methane-\n\nderived authigenic carbonates. In contrast, during sealevel rise at the glacial to interglacial \n\ntransitions, the seawater pressure increases and the pressure difference between the \n\nseawater column pressure and the hydraulic pressure in the plumbing system of the \n\nmethane seep diminishes or is minimal. In this way, sealevel rise restricts fluid flow or \n\nstops it. Consequently, considering just the pressure effect, the carbonate precipitation \n\nduring interglacial stages should be low or null and maximum precipitation should \n\ncoincide with glacial maxima. This scenario is similar to the observed short-term tidal \n\ncontrol on the fluid flow intensity variations in shallow water seep sites, where higher rates \n\nof fluid flow are measured coinciding with the low tides, whereas high tides are \n\ncharacterised by low or null flow rates (Boles et al., 2001; Rollet et al., 2006). The tidal \n\neffect on fluid flow intensity is still an effective process at deep locations up to 800 m \n\nwater depth, as documented in the Hydrate Ridge (Tryon and Brown, 2001; Tryon et al., \n\n2002). \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 273\n\nVigorous fluid flow may nevertheless also occur during sealevel highstands as long \n\nas the hydraulic pressure exceeds the pressure of the height of the water column. \n\nIn the following discussion, the mentioned isotopic stages are referred to as Marine \n\nIsotopic Stages (MIS) and their timing is defined according to Martinson et al. (1987), \n\nShackleton (2000) and the LR04 stack of Lisiecki and Raymo (2005). \n\nThe estimated ages of the sub-samples indicate formation (1) at the onsets of \n\nterminations 2 and 3, contemporary with rapid sealevel rise; (2) at the transition from \n\nstadial to interstadial, also corresponding to rapid sealevel rise; and (3) at the transition \n\nfrom interglacial (MIS 5.5) to stadial MIS 5.4 or from interglacial (MIS 5.3) to stadial 5.2, \n\nassociated with periods of progressive sealevel lowering (Figure 7.12). \n\nSample 3463-A08 with an estimated age of 245-246 ka (260 ka according to the \n\nisochron dating technique) is associated with precipitation during termination 3, at the end \n\nof MIS 8 and beginning of MIS 7 (between 8.02 and 7.5), corresponding to precipitation \n\nduring a period of a rapid sealevel rise (Figure 7.12). \n\nThe estimated age of 221 ka of the sub-sample 7 collected from the centre of conduit \n\n1 in sample 3463-A03 correlates with the transition from a stadial (MIS 7.4) to an \n\ninterstadial (MIS 7.3), during a time span corresponding to a rapid sealevel rise. Sub-\n\nsample 6 from the exterior of conduit 1, (sample 3463-A03) with an age of 135 ka, is \n\nrelated to the base of termination 2 and therefore the onset of a rapid sealevel rise. It is \n\ntherefore evident that the centre and the periphery of conduit 1 are associated with two \n\ndifferent fluid flow episodes. Sub-sample 8, in between the two conduits 1 and 2 in sample \n\n3463-A08, correlates with MIS 5, namely the transition from interglacial (MIS 5.5) to \n\nstadial MIS 5.4 and consequently with a formation related to a progressive sealevel \n\nlowering. Sub-samples at the centre of conduit 2 (sub-sample 10) and at their periphery \n\n(sub-sample 9) corresponding to ages of 89 and 93 ka respectively, are contemporary with \n\na period of progressive sealevel lowering, from the interstadial MIS 5.3 to the stadial MIS \n\n5.2. Sub-samples at the centre and periphery of conduit 2 (sub-sample 10) and in between \n\nconduit 1 and 2 (sub-sample 9) can be interpreted as formed in result of the lowering of the \n\nseawater column pressure reduction and intensification of the fluid flux of methane-rich \n\nfluid and subsequent authigenic carbonate precipitation. \n\nThe ages of the MDAC sub-samples are therefore associated with periods of rapid \n\nsealevel changes: rapid sealevel rises (such as the terminations 2 and 3) or the interstadial \n\n\n\nChapter 7. U/Th Ages of dolomite chimneys from the Gulf of Cadiz: record of intense past fluid \nescape episodes \n\n 274 \n\nto stadial progressive sealevel lowering periods. This shows that the direct pressure \n\nvariation of the seawater column is not the predominant factor controlling the fluid flow of \n\nthe methane-rich fluids from which the carbonates precipitated. Therefore, the sealevel \n\nvariation and seawater pressure conceptual model for controlling the fluid flow intensity at \n\nthe cold seeps can not be used to explain the formation of most of the samples. As the \n\npressure effect is not the most significant effect on controlling fluid flow, it is proposed \n\nthat temperature changes are the preferable forcing factor on fluid flow intensity. \n\nGlacial and interglacial changes induce changes in the MO intensity and the depth at \n\nwhich it flows at the seafloor (Faug\u00e8ers et al., 1984; Llave et al., 2006; Voelker et al., \n\n2006). During globally cooler conditions, as during the glacial stages, the MO was denser \n\nand therefore the centres of the MO cores were located deeper than at present. On the other \n\nhand, during warm periods the MO was less dense, favouring an increased intensity of the \n\nMO on upper slope areas (Llave et al., 2006). Under present day conditions, corresponding \n\nto an interglacial stage, the sites where samples 3463-A03 and 3463-A08 were collected \n\nfrom are located under intense influence of the lower core of the MO (Figure 7.1). At \n\npresent, the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) is thin (46 m for 100% methane gas \n\nhydrate) or even nonexistent (100% methane gas hydrate), considering the upper \n\ntemperature values of 12\u00baC within the seasonal MO temperature variations. During glacial \n\nperiods, it is proposed that the sampling sites are characterised by a weaker MO influence, \n\nor the MO position does not bath the sampling site locations. Therefore at these sites the \n\nseabottom water temperature and the temperature in the upper part of the sediment column \n\nshould be inferior to the present day temperatures. The base of the GHSZ at the sampling \n\nsites during glacials should therefore be deeper than during the interglacial stages. Methane \n\nhydrates should therefore have stabilized and accumulated during glacial stages, when the \n\nMO had a weaker positive temperature influence at the sampling sites. At interglacial \n\nstages, especially at the glacial terminations, the MO rapidly increases its influence and the \n\nseafloor bottom water temperature and consequently the temperature in the upper \n\nsediments should increase, reducing the GHSZ and increasing gas hydrate dissociation, \n\nenhancing the methane-rich fluid flow at the top sedimentary column or even at the \n\nseafloor. Therefore, it is proposed that the MDAC precipitation is recording intense fluid \n\nflow episodes occurring during periods of higher temperature of the seabottom water and \n\nof the upper sediment column, as a result of greater influence of the MO at these sampling \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 275\n\nsites. This increase in seabottom water temperature is, most probably, causing changes on \n\nthe gas hydrate stability zone, causing its reduction, leading to gas hydrate dissociation and \n\nto it consequent release of methane-rich fluids which will induce the carbonate \n\nprecipitation along the fluid conduits on the fluid pathways above the methane seepage \n\nsites. \n\n \n\n10\n\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n1\n\n2-5\n\nMIS\n1\n\nMIS\n2\n\nMIS\n3\n\nMIS\n4\n\nMIS\n5\n\nMIS\n6\n\nMIS\n7\n\nMIS\n8\n\nMIS\n9\n\nMIS\n10\n\nMIS\n11\n\nT\ner\n\nm\nin\n\nat\nio\n\nn \n3\n\nT\ner\n\nm\nin\n\nat\nio\n\nn \n2\n\n2\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n-0.8\n-1\n-1.2\n-1.4\n-1.6\n-1.8\n-2\n-2.2\n-2.4\n\nN\nor\n\nm\nal\n\niz\ned\n\n L\nR\n\n04\n s\n\nta\nck\n\n ?\n18\n\nO\n (\u2030\n\n)\n\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400\nAge (ka)\n\n140\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n?\n S\n\nea\nle\n\nve\nl (\n\nm\n)\n\n1.\n1\n\n2\n2.\n\n2\n2.\n\n21\n2.\n\n23\n3\n\n3.\n1\n\n3.\n13\n\n3.\n3\n\n3.\n31\n\n4\n4.\n\n22\n4.\n\n23\n4.\n\n24\n5\n\n5.\n1\n\n5.\n2\n\n5.\n31\n\n5.\n3\n\n5.\n33\n\n5.\n4\n\n5.\n51\n\n5.\n5\n\n5.\n53\n\n6\n6.\n\n2\n6.\n\n3\n\n6.\n4\n\n6.\n41\n\n6.\n42\n\n6.\n5\n\n6.\n6\n\n7\n7.\n\n1\n7.\n\n2\n\n7.\n3\n\n7.\n4\n\n7.\n5\n\n8\n8.\n\n02\n\n8.\n4\n\n8.\n5\n\n9 10 11\n\n \nFigure 7.12. Ages of the two dolomite chimney samples projected over the ?18OSMOW estimated sealevel \n\nvariation curve. The sealevel variation curve is based on the assumption that the global seawater ?18OSMOW \n\nvariation resultant from glacial-interglacial ice volume change is of about 1\u2030 (Schrag et al., 1996; Duplessy \n\net al., 2002) and that the entire sealevel scale is 125 m (Fairbanks and Matthews, 1978; Fairbanks, 1989). \n\nThe plotted ?18O curve corresponds to the normalized \u201cLR04\u201d stack (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005).

Salinity and pH have minor effects, neglected \n\nin this discussion. \n\nThe analysed chimney samples are composed of a mixture of different carbonate \n\nphases where either calcite or dolomite is dominant (Table 7.2). In order to reconstruct the \n\n\n\nChapter 7. U/Th Ages of dolomite chimneys from the Gulf of Cadiz: record of intense past fluid \nescape episodes \n\n 276 \n\ntemperature and the ?18O composition of the fluids from which the authigenic carbonates \n\nprecipitated, it is necessary to calculate the isotopic composition of the different carbonate \n\nphases. Therefore, the bulk isotopic composition of the sub-samples were plotted as a \n\nfunction of their mineral content, and the isotopic composition of the pure calcite and \n\ndolomite were extrapolated using the correlation trend line calculated from a group of \n\nsamples leached with EDTA, which allowed the total dissolution of the calcite and Mg-\n\ncalcite phases until obtaining and analyse of the pure dolomite phase (Figure 6.10, in \n\nchapter 6). This allowed the estimation of the isotopic composition of the calcite and \n\ndolomite phases, as shown in Table 7.3 and in Figure 7.13. \n\nConsidering the present day bottom water temperature of 11\u00baC, as determined from \n\nnearby CTD data of the CANIGO project (Figure 7.1), and the bottom water oxygen \n\nisotopic composition ranging from 0.6 to 0.7\u2030 SMOW at site SWIM04-42, at 35.88\u00baN; \n\n7.53\u00baW (Voelker, 2005, Personal Communication), the expected isotopic composition of \n\ncalcite should range from 1.19 to 1.29\u2030 VPDB, and dolomite should vary between 4.24 \n\nand 4.34\u2030 VPDB (Table 7.3), according to the Kim and O'Neil (1997) fractionation \n\nequation for calcite and the Vasconcelos et al. (2005) equation for dolomite. In sample \n\n3463-A03, the estimated isotopic composition of calcite is enriched in 18O (0.43\u2030 up to \n\n0.76\u2030 VPDB) relative to their expected modern conditions, while dolomite is 1.61 up to \n\n1.94\u2030 VPDB enriched in 18O relative to their expected modern conditions. In sample \n\n3463-A08, the estimated isotopic composition of calcite and dolomite are more depleted in \n18O than expected for modern conditions. Calcite shows estimated values ranging from -\n\n0.58 to 0.05\u2030 VPDB, corresponding to a depletion of up to 1.87\u2030 VPDB, while dolomite \n\nshows estimated values ranging from 3.65 to 4.28\u2030 VPDB, corresponding to a depletion \n\nin 18O up to 0.69\u2030 VPDB. These significant discrepancies between the estimated isotopic \n\ncompositions of the pure phases of calcite or dolomite and the theoretical values under \n\nmodern temperature and bottom seawater isotopic compositions indicate that the \n\ntemperature and isotopic compositions of the fluids from which the authigenic carbonates \n\nprecipitated are significantly different from the present day conditions. \n\n \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 277\n\n?1\n8 O = \n\n0.04\n23 *\n\n Dol (wt\n%)\n\n + 1.\n4321\n\n(calcite) (dolomite)\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n\nDolomite/(Calcite+Mg-calcite) wt.%\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n?1\n8 O\n\n\u2030\n (P\n\nD\nB\n\n)\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n?1\n8 O\n\n\u2030\n (P\n\nD\nB\n\n)\n\n1\n\n2\n3\n\n45\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n \nFigure 7.13.

The estimated fluid composition for the different temperatures is \n\nshown in Table 7.6 and Figure 7.14. Seawater ?18OSMOW changes are a consequence of the \n\nglacial-interglacial cyclicity, as evidenced by the ?18O LR04 curve (Figure 7.12 and Figure \n\n7.14). The exact value for the ?18O difference between glacial and interglacial periods is \n\nstill under discussion, but estimates of the deep ocean water ?18O between the Last Glacial \n\nMaximum (LGM) and the Holocene (MIS1) points to a value of about 1.05\u2030 (Duplessy et \n\nal., 2002). Although this 1.05\u2030 variation does not necessary apply for all the MIS, \n\nespecially in the Gulf of Cadiz where the presence of the Mediterranean water can \n\nintroduce significant variations on the bottom seawater ?18O composition, it is considered \n\nas a good approximation to the true value. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 7. U/Th Ages of dolomite chimneys from the Gulf of Cadiz: record of intense past fluid \nescape episodes \n\n 278 \n\n7.3.4.1 Sample 3463-A03 \n\nIn sample 3463-A03, the pure calcite and dolomite phases are estimated to \n\nprecipitate from fluids that are significantly enriched in 18O compared to the expected \n\ncomposition of the seawater for the corresponding MIS (Table 7.6 and Figure 7.14). In \n\nFigure 7.14 the estimated fluid compositions are shifted towards heavier 18O values than \n\nthe predicted by the ?18O LR04 curve. Sub-sample 8 indicates precipitation from fluids \n\nenriched in 18O (from 0.68\u2030 SMOW at 8\u00baC up to 2.02\u2030 SMOW, at 14\u00baC for calcite and \n\nfrom 0.8\u2030 SMOW at 4\u00baC up to 3.24\u2030 SMOW at 14\u00baC for dolomite). Calcite precipitation \n\nclose to expected seawater composition is obtained with a precipitation temperature of 4\u00baC. \n\nHowever, temperatures higher than 8\u00baC are thought to be more plausible at these water \n\ndepths for the correspondent sub-sample age. The estimated fluid composition values are \n\ntoo heavy (for 8\u00baC, more than 1.2\u2030 SMOW heavier than the present day 0.6\u2030 SMOW \n\nseawater isotopic composition) to be explained by glacial-interglacial fluctuation of the \n\nseawater ?18O composition alone. Therefore these isotopic values are interpreted as \n\nincluding a significant contribution of heavier isotopic water resulting, most probably, \n\nfrom the destabilization of gas hydrates. Sub-samples 6 and 7 also indicate heavier isotopic \n\ncomposition of the fluids from which the authigenic dolomite precipitated, although this \n\nenrichment is not as significant as in sub-sample 8. \n\nThe precipitation of calcite can be explained by formation at a temperature of 4 to \n\n8\u00baC in sub-samples 6 and 7 i.e. at a temperature range close to the present day values (8 to \n\n12\u00baC). The dolomite estimated fluid composition indicates heavier 18O fluid composition \n\nor significantly lower temperature of precipitation (less than 4\u00baC for sub-sample 7, and \n\nbetween 4 and 8\u00baC for sub-sample 6). Considering the glacial-interglacial relative age of \n\nthe sub-samples, it should be expected for sample 8 the highest temperature of \n\nprecipitation and for sample 6 the lowest temperature of precipitation, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 7.14 (where the temperatures of precipitation considering a constant ?18O fluid \n\ncomposition value of 0.6\u2030 SMOW are plotted in magenta open circles for calcite and X \n\nsymbols for dolomite). Sub-sample 8 however corresponds to the lowest estimated \n\ntemperatures of precipitation (7.65\u00baC for calcite and 3.24\u00baC for dolomite) while sub-\n\nsample 6 corresponds to the highest temperature of formation (8.65\u00baC for calcite and \n\n4.10\u00baC for dolomite). At the location where the samples were collected, the MO intensity is \n\nexpected to be higher during the interglacial periods and weaker during glacials (as \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 279\n\ndiscussed before). Therefore, the calculated relative temperatures are in opposite phase to \n\nthose expected from the glacial-interglacial timing and the consecutive MO intensity. It is \n\ntherefore interpreted that the predominant factor that is being reflected in the isotopic \n\ncomposition of the authigenic carbonates is the variation in the isotopic composition of the \n\nfluids from which the carbonates precipitated. \n\nIf one considers the precipitation of the authigenic carbonates from a constant fluid \n\nisotopic composition, then the authigenic calcite and dolomite compositions have to be \n\nexplained by temperature variations. The estimated temperature of formation of the several \n\nsub-samples (plotted in Figure 7.14) indicates a variation that is not in agreement with the \n\nexpected variation correspondent to the different MIS. Also the temperature amplitudes \n\nbetween the sub-samples (from 0.86\u00baC up to 1.0\u00baC) are much lower than the temperature \n\namplitudes that would be expected from the very different formation stages of the sub-\n\nsamples. These low temperature amplitudes are interpreted instead as reflecting a relatively \n\nconstant temperature of the seeping fluids and that the oxygen isotopic variability of the \n\nauthigenic calcite and dolomite preferentially reflects variations in the source fluid 18O \n\ncomposition, instead of temperature variations. \n\nIt should be noted that, while the different sub-samples from sample 3463-A03 \n\ncorrespond to a large time range (88 to 221 ka), corresponding to different MIS and to \n\nsignificant variability in the seawater ?18O composition, the isotopic values of the \n\nauthigenic carbonates have relatively constant composition values. This is interpreted as \n\nreflecting a similar fluid composition that is not significantly controlled by the glacial-\n\ninterglacial seawater isotopic variability but, most probably is mainly constrained by the \n\npore water and seepage fluid compositions. As such, this sample seems to exhibit a \n\ncontribution from pore waters resulting from dissolution of gas hydrates. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 7.

All sub-samples \n\n(1-5) indicate calcite precipitation from fluids depleted in 18O (from -2.77\u2030 SMOW at 4\u00baC \n\nup to 0.12\u2030 SMOW at 14\u00baC). For dolomite, the estimated fluid composition is heavier \n\nthan the estimated fluid composition for calcite. This can be explained by a contribution \n\nfrom the detrital calcite fraction from the calcareous microfossils that should have a \n\nisotopic oxygen source distinct from the methane-derived authigenic calcite, or could \n\nindicate a slightly different fluid composition or a different temperature during the \n\nformation of the various authigenic carbonate phases (as already discussed in chapter 6). \n\nThe estimated composition of the fluids from which the dolomite precipitated indicates \n\nfluid compositions ranging from -1.72\u2030 SMOW at 4\u00baC up to 1.34\u2030 SMOW at 14 \u00baC. \n\nThese values correspond to fluids with compositions close to the seawater value expected \n\nfor the corresponding MIS period for the several sub-samples, with the exception of sub-\n\nsample 1, which has a heavier isotopic fluid composition than the other sub-samples. \n\nSample 3463-A08 does not therefore show a clear contribution from a heavier oxygen \n\nsource, with the exception of dolomite from sub-sample 1; as such, the contribution from \n\nthe dissociation of gas hydrates is not considered to be significant for the fluids from which \n\nthis sample precipitated. Furthermore, it should be noted that all sub-samples in sample \n\n3463-A08 have similar ?18O compositions. The similar isotopic compositions of the \n\nauthigenic calcite and dolomite (maximum difference of 0.63\u2030) also support their similar \n\nage values. This can also be interpreted as reflecting a major contribution from a methane \n\nrich fluid with a constant composition. The contribution from seawater source fluids is \n\ninterpreted as being minor since the composition trend of the authigenic calcite and \n\ndolomite does not have any similarity with the expected seawater isotopic trend illustrated \n\nby the ?18O LR04 curve (Figure 7.14). \n\nIf one considers the precipitation of the authigenic carbonates from a fluid with a \n\nconstant isotopic composition (c.a. the present day 0.6\u2030 SMOW), then, in order to explain \n\nthe calcite and dolomite ?18O compositions, the temperature of precipitation of the \n\ndifferent sub-samples shows a variation that is not in agreement with the expected \n\ntemperature variation correspondent to the MIS ages of the sub-samples. Temperature \n\n\n\nChapter 7. U/Th Ages of dolomite chimneys from the Gulf of Cadiz: record of intense past fluid \nescape episodes \n\n 282 \n\namplitudes between the sub-samples (up to 2.65\u00baC for dolomite and up to 2.95\u00baC for \n\ncalcite) would have to be considered to explain the authigenic calcite and dolomite \n\ncompositions (Figure 7.14). As these temperature amplitudes are observed in sub-samples \n\nwith very close ages, they are interpreted as being less probable to occur as a consequence \n\nof the glacial-interglacial variation during the correspondent short time span for this \n\nsample formation. These temperature amplitudes and the fact that they show a variation \n\nthat is not in agreement with the one expected from the ages of the several sub-samples, \n\nare interpreted as indicating that the oxygen isotopic variability of the authigenic calcite \n\nand dolomite preferentially reflects variations in the fluid 18O compositions, instead of \n\ntemperature variations. \n\nThe amount of data available is not yet sufficient to support a robust refinement of \n\nthe proposed inferences concerning the fluid isotopic composition and their source and \n\nformation temperature. Further investigation has to be carried out in order to better \n\nconstrain the use of the MDAC as a proxy for the reconstruction of the seep fluids \n\ncomposition and formation temperatures. \n\n \n\n7.3.5 Formation model of the two chimneys \n\nThe sample 3463-A03 that is characterized by high initial sediment porosity and high \n\npermeability it is proposed, according to the general formation model (as discussed in \n\nchapter 5), that this chimney will be formed by cementation resultant from the precipitation \n\nof authigenic carbonates as result of anaerobic methane oxidation coupled with sulphate \n\nreduction, at the reaction front between a percolating fluid (gas or solution) enriched in \n\nmethane and the in situ interstitial sulphate enriched pore waters. The percolated methane-\n\nrich fluid would preferentially, for the case of sample 3463-A03, percolate trough the \n\nsediment along a percolation pathway of higher interstitial porosity, cementing the original \n\nsediments along this pathway, without the requisition of an open vent conduit, as the initial \n\npermeability of the sediments are high. Therefore, the lithification resulted on a completely \n\ncemented conduit, which would correspond (approximately), to the centre of conduit 1 \n\n(Figure 7.7). Subsequent fluid flow episodes would kip using the same pathway but around \n\nthis cemented hard nucleus. Therefore, this conduit would grow spreading out from the \n\ncentre of conduit 1. If the cementation resulted in blocking of the fluid initial pathway, \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 283\n\nlatter fluid flow episodes have to fallow different pathways that would again form a \n\ncemented nucleus with the cementation grow spreading out from this second conduit. \n\nWhen the two conduits are closely spaced than the unification of both could occur. To be \n\nnoted that, these two or even more parallel conduits, can be contemporary or subsequent, \n\nlike it is the proposed for sample 3463-A03. The space between two parallel conduits can \n\nexhibit authigenic carbonate minerals corresponding to a mixture of the two fluid episodes \n\nand therefore ages that would correspond to a mixture or intermediate ages. \n\nThe fluid pathways through out the sediments can be constrained and resulting from \n\nsedimentary discontinuities such as borrows. In fact many of the chimney samples \n\nresemble the shape and structure of many borrows and scavenger holes of many organisms \n\nwhere two parallel tubular holes are frequent. \n\nThe sample 363-A08 corresponds to the lithification of clay rich sediments. The \n\npermeability of the initial sediment material would be reducen when compared to the \n\nmaterial that composed the unconsolidated sediment of sample 3463-A03. It is proposed \n\nthat the unconsolidated sediment of sample 3463-A08 would have low or reduced \n\npermeability and therefore the percolation of any fluids throughout these sediments would \n\nrequire that the fluid would form a vent conduit that had to be open for the methane-rich \n\nfluid percolation. Therefore the AOM-SR reaction front and the precipitation of the \n\nauthigenic cement would occur spreading out from the methane-rich fluid conduit, but \n\nwould occur in a single episode and within an unique event, as indicated by the ages \n\nobtained from this sample. The precipitation would occur as long far as the AOM-SR \n\nreaction front would be able to progress away from the open vent conduit, into the sulphate \n\nzone. Once the cementation reach a complete cementation of the open vent conduit walls, \n\nit would block the laterally methane percolation and therefore the AOM-SR reaction would \n\ncessed. Therefore open vent chimneys would correspond to a single cemented episode. \n\nSubsequent episodes of fluid flow could induce the cement formation within the open vent \n\nconduit if the environment inside the conduit would go through a previous episode of \n\nrefilling with sulphate that would feed new episode of AOM-SR reaction. This would \n\nresult in chimneys with a concentric grow layers, having a younger core and an older \n\nperiphery. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 7. U/Th Ages of dolomite chimneys from the Gulf of Cadiz: record of intense past fluid \nescape episodes \n\n 284 \n\n7.4 Conclusions \n\n \n\nThe estimated ages of the two dolomite chimneys analysed indicate that the \n\nprecipitation of the authigenic carbonates occurs, from the centre or axis of the chimney to \n\nthe periphery, during short intervals of time and the chimneys can growth during several \n\ndiscontinuous episodes, probably with longer periods with absence of precipitation. The \n\nchimneys that result from the precipitation during different episodes will be most probably \n\nevidence different grow layers or concentric rings. \n\nThe estimated ages of the sub-samples indicate formation at periods of rapid \n\npaleoclimatic changes. The samples point to precipitation during (1) the onsets of \n\nterminations 2 and 3, contemporary with rapid sealevel rises; (2) at the transition from \n\nstadial to interstadial, also corresponding to rapid sealevel rise; and (3) at the transition \n\nfrom interglacial (MIS 5.5) to stadial MIS 5.4 or from interglacial (MIS 5.3) to stadial 5.2, \n\nassociated with periods of progressive sealevel lowering (Figure 7.12). \n\nIt is proposed that the MDAC precipitation are recording intense fluid flow episodes \n\nduring periods of increased seabottom water temperature as a result of the increase of the \n\nMO influence at the locations where the samples were collected from. This increase in \n\nseabottom water temperature is, most probably, reducing the gas hydrate stability zone, \n\nleading to gas hydrate dissociation and consequent release of methane-rich fluids which \n\nwill induce the carbonate precipitation along the fluid conduits on the fluid pathways \n\nabove the methane seepage sites. \n\nEstimated compositions of the fluids from which the authigenic precipitated indicate \n\nfor sample 3463-A03 a precipitation from fluids that are significantly enriched in 18O \n\ncompared to the expected composition of the seawater for the correspondent MIS. These \n\nisotopic values are interpreted as including a significant contribution of heavier isotopic \n\nwater resulting, most probably, from the destabilization of gas hydrates. Sample 3463-A08, \n\nhowever, does not indicate a similar evolution; its precipitation is compatible with the \n\nexpected correspondent MIS fluid isotopic composition. \n\n \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 285\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 8.   Biomarker and SEM evidences of microbial \nmediation in the formation of MDAC in the Gulf of Cadiz  \n\n \n\n \n\n8.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nAs described in detail in Chapter 5, two main lithologic types of MDAC were \n\nidentified in the collected samples from the Gulf of Cadiz: (1) dolomite-dominated \n\ncarbonates; and (2) aragonite-dominated carbonates. The dolomite-dominated carbonates \n\nform crusts, irregular massive or nodular aggregates, and chimneys (fluid conduits or filled \n\nburrows). The dolomite samples have been found along the Guadalquivir diapiric ridge \n\n(GDR), the Formoza Ridge, the Cadiz and the Guadalquivir Channels, in the \n\nMediterranean Outflow (MO) channel in front of Gibraltar Strait, in the Pen Duick and \n\nVernadsky ridges, in the Iberico mud cone, and in the Faro, Hesperides, Student and Yuma \n\nmud volcanoes (Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2002; D\u00edaz-del-R\u00edo et al., 2003; Magalh\u00e3es et al., \n\n2005b). The aragonitic pavements form crusts or slabs that pave the seafloor for several \n\nsquare meters or form buildups and irregular blocks, up to 2 m high, at the seabottom. \n\nThey have been found in the Pen Duick and Vernadsky ridges, within the Cadiz Channel, \n\nand also associated with several mud volcanoes: Porto, Jesus Baraza, Yuma, Ginsburg, \n\nDarwin, Shauen, Kidd, Mercator, Fiuza, Faro, Hesperides and Meknes (Figure 8.1). \n\nAs discussed in Chapters 5, 6 and 7, the formation of some of these MDAC in the \n\nGulf of Cadiz is related to episodes of enhanced fluid seepage, at least during the last 250 \n\nka, and some of them are related to episodes of gas hydrate formation and dissociation. \n\nThe precipitation of these authigenic carbonates (as described in Chapter 5), is \n\nsimilar to that described for modern environments throughout the world\u2019s oceans, at a \n\nvariety of depths, associated with hydrocarbon seepage (e.g. Kulm et al., 1986; Hovland et \n\nal., 1987; Ritger et al., 1987; Hovland and Judd, 1988; Kulm and Suess, 1990; Paull et al., \n\n1992; Aharon, 1994; Bohrmann et al., 1998; Greinert et al., 1999; Aloisi et al., 2000; \n\n\n\nChapter 8. Biomarker and SEM evidences of microbial mediation in the formation of MDAC in the \nGulf of Cadiz \n\n 286 \n\nElvert et al., 2000; Greinert et al., 2000; Greinert et al., 2001; Campbell et al., 2002; \n\nGreinert et al., 2002; D\u00edaz-del-R\u00edo et al., 2003). Their formation is assigned to the sulphate \n\nreduction zone or to the transition between the sulphate reduction zone and the \n\nmethanogenic zone, where microbial sulphate reduction (SR) is coupled with anaerobic \n\noxidation of methane (AOM) (Ritger et al., 1987; Paull et al., 1992; Hoehler et al., 1994) \n\naccording to the Reeburgh (1980) net equation (see Chapter 5). As a by-product of AOM, \n\nbicarbonate is produced with a consequent increase of the pore water fluid alkalinity, \n\npromoting the precipitation of the authigenic carbonates. AOM is a microbial-mediated \n\nprocess performed by a consortium of methanotrophic archaea and sulphate-reducing \n\nbacteria (SRB), occurring in anoxic environments, where sulphate is used as electron \n\nreceptor (Hoehler et al., 1994; Hinrichs et al., 1999; Boetius et al., 2000; Hinrichs et al., \n\n2000; Pancost et al., 2000; Orphan et al., 2001a; Orphan et al., 2001b). The evidences for \n\nthis process, as described for several modern cold seeps and gas hydrate occurrences, \n\nderive from archaeal biomarkers, such as Crocetane 2,6,11,15-tetramethylhexadecane (e.g. \n\nThiel et al., 1999; Boetius et al., 2000; Elvert et al., 2000; Hinrichs et al., 2000; Pancost et \n\nal., 2000; Elvert et al., 2001; Orphan et al., 2001a; Pancost et al., 2001b; Thiel et al., \n\n2001a; Thiel et al., 2001b; Hinrichs and Boetius, 2002; Michaelis et al., 2002; Werne et \n\nal., 2004; Pancost et al., 2005), PMI (2,6,10,15,19-pentamethylicosane) and PMI? (e.g. \n\nThiel et al., 1999; Boetius et al., 2000; Elvert et al., 2000; Hinrichs et al., 2000; Pancost et \n\nal., 2000; Elvert et al., 2001; Orphan et al., 2001a; Pancost et al., 2001b; Thiel et al., \n\n2001a; Thiel et al., 2001b; Hinrichs and Boetius, 2002; Michaelis et al., 2002; Werne et \n\nal., 2004; Pancost et al., 2005), Squalane (2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyltetracosane) and \n\nsqualenes (Elvert et al., 2000), that can have an archaeal source or can have a bacterial \n\norigin, Archaeol (2,3-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycerol) (e.g. Boetius et al., 2000; Elvert et al., \n\n2000; Pancost et al., 2000; Elvert et al., 2001; Orphan et al., 2001a; Pancost et al., 2001b; \n\nHinrichs and Boetius, 2002; Michaelis et al., 2002; Werne et al., 2004; Pancost et al., \n\n2005), Hydroxyarchaeol (2-O-3-hydroxyphytanyl-3-O-phytanyl-sn-glycerol) (e.g. Boetius \n\net al., 2000; Pancost et al., 2000; Orphan et al., 2001a; Pancost et al., 2001b; Hinrichs and \n\nBoetius, 2002; Michaelis et al., 2002; Werne et al., 2004; Pancost et al., 2005), and \n\nBiphytanyl tetraethers (Thiel et al., 1999; Pancost et al., 2000; Pancost et al., 2001b; Thiel \n\net al., 2001a; Thiel et al., 2001b; Michaelis et al., 2002; Pancost et al., 2005). All these \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 287\n\narchaeal biomarkers are characterized by extremely negative ?13C values (less than -100\u2030 \n\nVPDB). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 8.1. Occurrences of MDAC in the Gulf of Cadiz. The samples analysed for biomarkers in this work \n\nare highlighted with open blue circles. Black triangles indicate the location of known mud volcanoes. \n\n \n\nBiomarkers for SRB are frequently identified associated with the archaeal \n\nbiomarkers (Valentine and Reeburgh, 2000). Amongst these, alkyl diethers, 12-methyl-\n\ntetradecanoic acid, Mono- and dialkyl-glycerolethers (non isoprenoidal), n-, mono-methyl \n\n(i-, ai-, mid-chain), N-cyclohexyl and cyclopropyl carbon chains (e.g. Hinrichs et al., 2000; \n\nOrphan et al., 2001a; Pancost et al., 2001a; Hinrichs and Boetius, 2002; Michaelis et al., \n\n2002; Werne et al., 2004), and ester-bound fatty acids, such as n-, mono-methyl (i-, ai-, \n\nmid-chain), N-cyclohexyl, and cyclopropyl carbon chains are frequent (e.g. Boetius et al., \n\n2000; Hinrichs et al., 2000; Pancost et al., 2000; Orphan et al., 2001a; Pancost et al., \n\n2001a; Thiel et al., 2001a; Hinrichs and Boetius, 2002; Werne et al., 2004). \n\n\n\nChapter 8. Biomarker and SEM evidences of microbial mediation in the formation of MDAC in the \nGulf of Cadiz \n\n 288 \n\nIn active cold seep sediments, genetic analysis shows that the observed archaea \n\nbelong to either the clusters of AMNE-1 and AMNE-2, or those of the \n\nMethanomicrobiales/Methanosarcinales (Hinrichs et al., 1999; Hinrichs and Boetius, \n\n2002). The SRB are interpreted as most probably belonging to the \n\nDesulfocsarcina/Desulfococcus group (Michaelis et al., 2002). Direct morphological \n\nevidences of microbes at cold seeps have been shown via epifluorescence microscopy \n\n(Boetius et al., 2000; Orphan et al., 2001b) and in situ field surveys of putative Beggiatoa \n\nmats (Michaelis et al., 2002). \n\nIn ancient methane seep deposits, evidences of past microbial activity include \n\ngeochemical and biomarker signatures as well as morphologic evidences. The geochemical \n\nevidences for microbial involvement in the authigenic carbonate formation as a result of \n\nAOM include the association of authigenic carbonates with isotopic negative 13C values \n\nassociated with pyrite (Cavagna et al., 1999; Peckmann et al., 2002; Shapiro and Fricke, \n\n2002). Biomarkers indicative of archaea and their diagenetic products, such as PMI and \n\nC30 acyclic isoprenoids, are frequently associated with fossil hydrocarbon seep deposits \n\n(Peckmann et al., 1999a). Morphologic signatures of microbial activity include the \n\npresence of early non-detrital micrite, thinly laminated micrite, micrite diffusive peloids \n\nwith 0.1-1 mm in diameter (Campbell et al., 2002), dumbbell-shaped crystal bundles (Van \n\nLith et al., 2003), laminated sediments, hollow dolomite crystals, dolomitic tubes with 15 \n\n\u00b5m in diameter, cylindrical aggregates of framboidal pyrite with diameters of about 100 \n\n\u00b5m (Cavagna et al., 1999), dumbbell morphologies and body fossils of clotted \n\nmicrofabrics (Peckmann et al., 2002), pinnate bacteria with 0.3 \u00b5m in diameter and 1-1.5 \n\n\u00b5m long, sheaths with 2-4 \u00b5m in diameter or clusters of coccoids, up to 40 per cluster and \n\neach with 0.5-1 \u00b5m in diameter (Shapiro, 2004). \n\nA significant number of the MDAC occurrences in the Gulf of Cadiz are dolomite-\n\ndominated and occur in extensive areas of hundreds of square meters at the seafloor \n\n(Chapter 4). The study of these authigenic dolomite samples can bring new contributions to \n\nthe dolomite problem, by evaluating if these samples support the so-called microbial \n\nfactor, which proposes that microbial activity has an important role mediating the \n\nprecipitation of dolomite under normal temperature conditions (Vasconcelos et al., 1995; \n\nWarthmann et al., 2000). \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 289\n\nThis chapter focuses on the microbial component of the MDAC from the Gulf of \n\nCadiz, based on the petrography, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and biomarker \n\nevidences of microbial activity preserved in these MDAC. The aragonite pavements are \n\nconsidered to represent very recent or present day formation of authigenic carbonates \n\n(Chapter 5), whereas the dolomite chimneys probably represent older formation episodes \n\nover a period spanning at least from 89 ka until 250 ka (see Chapter 7). The analysis of the \n\ndifferent preserved microbial evidences can be used to track the degradation of the \n\nmicrobial signatures through time. \n\nIn order to attain these objectives, specific lipid biomarkers analyses were carried out \n\nat the Marine Biogeochemistry Laboratory of the Research Center for Ocean Margins \n\n(RCOM), of the Bremen University (Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2005a). SEM observations were \n\ncarried out at the ETH Centre (Zurich) and in the University of Aveiro, together with \n\npetrographic observations, in order to investigate morphological evidences of the microbial \n\nactivity. \n\n \n\n8.2 Materials and Methods \n\n \n\nThe samples selected for identification of microbial evidences were chosen based on \n\nthe best preservation potential of their organic content. Petrographic analysis was carried \n\nout on hand specimens and in thin sections with binocular microscope, petrographic \n\nmicroscope and cathodoluminescence. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and \n\nbiomarker analysis were also performed in selected samples (listed in Table 8.1). The \n\nchimneys were selected based on their degree of oxidation. Because the oxidation is a \n\nsecondary process that occurs after the exhumation of the samples from the sediments and \n\nbecause the oxidation will have a strong effect on the degradation of organic compounds, \n\nonly the samples with none or with weak signs of oxidation were selected. Amongst these, \n\nsamples 3463-A08 and 3722-A33 were selected (+ amostras da Luisa) (Figure 8.2), \n\nbecause they are compact, very homogeneous, massive, with no fractures, and do not show \n\nsignificant signs of alteration, and therefore have lower probabilities of being \n\ncontaminated. Aragonite pavement samples were also selected in order to represent the \n\ndifferent lithologic types and to obtain the best organic matter preservation. As such, only \n\n\n\nChapter 8.

Biomarker and SEM evidences of microbial mediation in the formation of MDAC in the \nGulf of Cadiz \n\n 292 \n\n8.2.1 Petrography, SEM and EDS \n\nThe samples used for this study were cut in 7 cm thick slices, from which thin \n\nsections were prepared in three perpendicular planes. The chimney samples were cut \n\nparallel and perpendicular to the chimney axis. \n\nSEM and energy dispersive spectrometer X-ray elementary analysis (EDS) were \n\nperformed on slices cut from the samples, in which the external and the existing friable \n\nmaterial or material containing penetrative fractures was removed. From these slices, chips \n\nwith 1x1x5 cm were cut and cleaned in distilled water in an ultrasonic cleaner for 15 \n\nminutes. Then, the samples were etched in 1% HCl for 1 minute. After etching, the \n\nsamples were rinsed in distilled water and immediately dried on a warm furnace (at 45\u00baC), \n\nand gold or carbon coated. After coating the samples were kept isolated in a desiccator to \n\navoid contamination. They were analysed on a Hitachi S4100 scanning electron \n\nmicroscope, operating at 15 kV and equipped with a backscattered electron detector \n\n(Rontec Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer system, series M) with a window for light \n\nelements. All photomicrographs are secondary electron imaging scans at varying working \n\ndistances. The SEM-EDS analyses were performed both at ETH in Zurich, and in the \n\nCeramics Department of the University of Aveiro. \n\n \n\n8.2.2 Lipid Biomarkers \n\n8.2.2.1 Sample preparation \n\nThe aragonite pavements are considered to represent a more recent carbonate \n\ngeneration than the dolomite chimneys. Previous studies (Duarte, 2005; Niemann et al., \n\n2005; Niemann et al., 2006) have already shown that the biomarker indicators are very \n\nabundant in this type of samples. Sample 3340 (Figure 8.2) was selected because it shows \n\nno signs of oxidation. From this aragonite pavement sample, 20 g of material was collected \n\nand prepared for biomarker extraction. As concerns the dolomite chimneys, 250 g of \n\nmaterial was collected and prepared for biomarker extraction by fragmenting to small 5 cm \n\nthick slices from samples 3458-B11, TTR14-566Gr, TTR15-599D.B01, TTR15-\n\n599D.C02, TTR15-599D.D02, 3463-A08 and 3722-A33 (Figure 8.2), avoiding the \n\nperiphery and fractured parts of the samples that can act as contamination sources. \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 293\n\nThe sample preparation procedure used for extraction and purification of the lipid \n\nbiomarkers was based on the method of Peckmann et al. (2004). The analytical \n\nmethodology used for the dolomite chimney samples is described in the flowchart of \n\nFigure D.2, Appendix D and the one used for the aragonite pavements is shown in the \n\nflowchart of Figure D.1, Appendix D. \n\n8.2.2.2 Analytical procedure \n\nThe freshly broken carbonate samples were decalcified (HCl) and the dried residue \n\nwas refluxed in 6% KOH in CH3OH (saponification reaction: 2 h). The supernatant was \n\ndecanted and the residue was repeatedly extracted by ultrasonication in CH2Cl2/CH3OH \n\n(3:1; v:v) until the solvent became colourless. Subsequently, the combined supernatants \n\nwere portioned in CH2Cl2 versus water (pH 2). The resulting total extract was dried and \n\nseparated by column chromatography (Merck silica gel 60, 0.063-0.200 mm; i.d.: 15 mm, \n\nlength: 35 mm) into fractions containing: (1) hydrocarbons (20 ml or 3 column volumes of \n\nn-hexane); (2) esters/ketones (20 ml of n-hexane/CH2Cl2 2:1); (3) alcohol (20 ml of \n\nCH2Cl2/aceton 9:1; and (4) fatty acids/polars (20 ml of MeOH). The esters/ketones and \n\nalcohol fractions were dried and derivatised using pyridine and BSTFA (2:1) at 70\u00baC (1 h). \n\nThe polar fractions/fatty acids were dried and transesterificated with boron-trifluoride \n\nmethanol and then with KCl + hexane. The internal standard used for all fractions was \n\nCholestane. A modification of the method, which involved a previous extraction with \n\nCH2Cl2/CH3OH (3:1; v:v) prior to decalcification, proved to be efficient in cleaning dirt \n\npeaks on the dolomite samples. \n\n8.2.2.3 Gas chromatography and coupled mass spectrometry (GC-MS) \n\nThe hydrocarbon fraction was examined by combined gas chromatography-mass \n\nspectrometry (GC-MS) using a Varian CP-3800 GC/Saturn 2000 MS EI-mode, 70eV) \n\nequipped with a 30 m fused silica capillary column (CP-Sil 8 CB Low Bleed, 0.25mm ID, \n\n0.25 \u00b5m film thickness). The carrier gas was He. The GC-temperature program used was: \n\ninjection at 80\u00baC, 5 min isothermal; from 80\u00baC to 310\u00baC at 4\u00baC min-1; 20 min isothermal. \n\nThe identification of the organic compounds was based on comparison of the mass spectra \n\nand the GC retention times with those of published data and reference compounds. \n\nCoupled GC-combustion-isotope ratio MS (GC-C-IRMS) was conducted using a \n\nFinnigan DeltaPlusXL mass spectrometer equipped with a HP6890GC and CuO/Ni/Pt \n\n\n\nChapter 8. Biomarker and SEM evidences of microbial mediation in the formation of MDAC in the \nGulf of Cadiz \n\n 294 \n\ncombustion furnace operated at 940\u00baC. Samples were injected splitless (1 min) onto a 30 m \n\nfused silica column (DB5-MS, 0.32 mm i.d., 0.25 \u00b5m film thickness) using a Gerstel \n\nCooled Injection System (CIS4) programmed from 48\u00baC (0 min) to 310\u00baC (10 min) at 12\u00baC \n\nsec-1. The carrier gas was He. The GC temperature program used was: 3 min at 80\u00baC; from \n\n80\u00baC to 310\u00baC at 4\u00baC min-1; 30 min at 310\u00baC. The GC-C-IRMS precision was checked \n\nusing a standard alkane mix (n-C15 to n-C29) with known isotopic composition. The stable \n\ncarbon isotope compositions are reported in the delta notation (?13C) vs. the VPDB \n\nStandard. \n\n \n\n8.3 Results \n\n8.3.1 Petrographic and SEM evidences of bacterial activity \n\nAlthough the organic remains of micro-organisms are not expected to be preserved in \n\nancient microbial carbonates (Stolz et al., 2001), because the organic compounds probably \n\ndegrade very fast, especially in oxidizing conditions, evidences of microbial origin are \n\nexpected to be preserved mainly as morphological structures. While the morphology and \n\nthe mineralogy of particles larger than 10 \u00b5m are not expected to reveal microbial induced \n\ncharacteristics (Knorre and Krumbein, 2000), embedded microbes and particles with \n\nshapes similar to bacteria and which are only slightly larger than bacteria are interpreted as \n\nevidence that microbes were present when the carbonate formed. Whether the microbes \n\njust happened to be there or whether they actually induced the carbonate precipitation \n\ncannot be undoubtedly inferred from the morphological observations. However, if the \n\ncorresponding sediment environmental physico-chemical conditions are suitable for \n\nmicrobial activity and if these appropriated microbial communities are proven to be \n\ninvolved in the carbonate precipitation, it is plausible to assume that these microbial \n\nevidences represent the direct involvement of those microbes in the carbonate formation. \n\nIndeed, it has been proposed that the microbes can induce an increase in carbonate \n\nalkalinity that will result in carbonate precipitation (Vasconcelos et al., 1995; Boetius et \n\nal., 2000; Castanier et al., 2000; Folk and Chafetz, 2000; Knorre and Krumbein, 2000; \n\nWarthmann et al., 2000; Hinrichs and Boetius, 2002; Van Lith et al., 2003) and therefore \n\nthey can function as nucleation sites (Knorre and Krumbein, 2000; Van Lith et al., 2003). \n\nIn this chapter, will be described many morphological evidences of microbial activity \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 295\n\nfound in the MDAC samples, such as peloid-like structures, filamentous structures and \n\nsmaller scale features. \n\n \n\n8.3.1.1 Dolomite chimneys \n\nMineralogy and textural characterization \n\nAs described in Chapter 5, the dolomite crusts, nodules and chimneys consist \n\nessentially of medium to tightly carbonate-cemented mudstones, siltstones, wackestones \n\nand sandstones (Figure 8.3 and Figure 8.4). The detrital fraction corresponds to a \n\nfossiliferous matrix with abundant bioclasts of planktonic and benthic foraminifera, \n\nostracods, pellets and silty terrigenous grains of quartz, calcite, feldspars, apatite, zircon \n\nand clays. Iron and manganese oxy-hydroxides are present in almost all the samples, \n\nstaining them with a variable brownish colour depending on the degree of oxidation of the \n\nsample. This is illustrated as example in Figure 8.3E, a thin section microphotograph of a \n\ntransversal slice from a 3 cm thick chimney, showing the iron oxidation pervasive coating \n\nprogressing from the exterior of the chimney (on the left of the image) and from their \n\ncentre. \n\nOn non oxidized samples or with a weak oxidation degree it is possible to recognize \n\nauthigenic pyrite, occurring as singular pyrite framboids&lt;20 \u00b5m (Figure 8.6), as \n\nframboidal aggregates&lt;200 \u00b5m (Figure 8.7B and C) isolated or forming groups, small \n\npyrite grains (<5 \u00b5m in size) isolated or forming clusters (Figure 8.3E and Figure 8.7A-C), \n\nand as euhedral pyrite single crystals (Figure 8.7B). Frequently, pyrite shows oxidation \n\nrims of brownish iron oxides probably containing OH-groups. Pyrite also occurs infilling \n\nforaminifera and other bioclasts chambers (Figure 8.3F); speckled on peloids (Figure 8.7A-\n\nC), generally associated with organic matter; disseminated in the carbonate matrix (Figure \n\n8.7B-C); or filling inter-clast porosity. Sulphur isotopic compositions of the pyrite show \n\nnegative ?34S values (-34\u2030 CDT) (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2006a, b). The presence of pyrite and \n\ntheir ?34S values indicate sulphate-reducing bacterial activity promoting the sulphide \n\nprecipitation in anoxic sediment conditions. Pyrite replacement by Fe-Mn oxy-hydroxides \n\n(goethite and others) is observed and is frequent on samples with high oxidation intensity \n\n(Figure 8.3E-F and Figure 8.7D-F). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 8.

The detrital grains range from clast-supported to matrix-supported. The cement \n\nshows a clotted microfabric (cm) where peloidal-like structures (p) are identified.

Biomarker and SEM evidences of microbial mediation in the formation of MDAC in the \nGulf of Cadiz \n\n 298 \n\nchimneys and nodules show low porosity, with absence of mega-porous and scarce \n\nfractures or cracks. The contacts between the cemented grains are irregular, ranging from \n\ncomplete to inter-grain pore spaces with dimensions lower than 10 \u00b5m, leaving little \n\nresidual porosity. The cement is composed of micrite to micro-sparite equigranular \n\nrhombohedric calcite, high Mg-calcite, protodolomite and dolomite with dimensions in the \n\nrange of 2-10 \u00b5m (Figure 8.4 and Figure 8.5). The texture varies from isolated \n\nrhombohedra and aggregates of interlocking sub-euhedral to euhedral crystals, sometimes \n\nexhibiting serrated crystal faces. More rarely the cement carbonates show sub-round \n\nshapes with sizes &lt;0.5 \u00b5m (Figure 8.3F). The contacts between detrital grains and the \n\ncement are dictated by the shape of the detrital grain. The carbonates are not observed \n\ndissolving or replacing the detrital grains. EDS chemical analysis of the dolomite crystals \n\nindicate Ca and Mg as the dominant constituents. Fe is also frequently identified on the \n\nEDS chemical analysis, with a proportion that is in general inferior to 5% on point analysis \n\nperformed on single cement crystals. Analyses performed over scanned areas show larger \n\nrelative abundance of Fe, even when performed on dolomite crystals. This is interpreted as \n\na consequence of the pervasive existence of iron oxy-hydroxides over most of the sample \n\nmaterial (Figure 8.5). Although dolomite can contain Fe in its crystallographic structure, \n\nthe analysed samples showed Mg:Fe > 4, and therefore are not interpreted as being \n\nankerite. In general, the cement crystals have non-estechiometric compositions and show \n\nan excess of Ca relative to the Mg; consequently a continuous of carbonate phases with \n\ncompositions ranging from dolomite, protodolomite and high Mg-calcite through calcite \n\ncan be observed in the authigenic cement (this is also evidenced by the X-ray diffraction \n\ndata, as discussed in Chapter 5). \n\nAll the cement minerals seem to be paragenetic. Cathodoluminescence does not \n\nreveal different generations in the micrite cement nor any compositional variability within \n\nthe crystals. The cement exhibits non-luminescence dull to medium orange to brownish red \n\ncolours. \n\nNeither on the SEM observations nor in the petrographic observations, was it \n\npossible to recognise any signs of calcite dissolution, or calcite replacement by dolomite. \n\nTherefore, the cement dolomite, protodolomite, calcite and the high Mg-calcites are \n\nconsidered to be primary authigenic mineralogy. \n\n \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 299\n\n \nFigure 8.5.

Biomarker and SEM evidences of microbial mediation in the formation of MDAC in the \nGulf of Cadiz \n\n 300 \n\nThe typical fabric of the dolomite chimneys includes the intrapelbiomicritic and \n\npelmicrite which are diagnostic of a biotic origin and show equivalent characteristics to \n\nother methane seep cements described in several other places and in ancient seep deposits \n\n(Peckmann et al., 2002; Shapiro and Fricke, 2002). \n\nPeloidal and clotted microfabrics \n\nThe cement of the dolomite chimney samples frequently show peloids, peloid-like \n\nallochems and clotted microfabric (Figure 8.7). The peloid-like structures have variable \n\nsizes, generally range from 10 to 300 \u00b5m in diameter, and are characterized, in thin section \n\n(Figure 8.7), by cloudy areas at their centres (clotted fabric) sometimes surrounded by a \n\nmore clear exterior rims of micritic to micro-spar crystals of carbonate (calcite, high Mg-\n\ncalcite or dolomite) or by indistinct and diffuse margins. The peloids are frequently \n\nspeckled by pyrite which, in some cases can be the dominant phase. Similar fabric is also \n\nfound at the interior of foraminifera tests (Figure 8.3F and Figure 8.6). Frequently the \n\npeloid-like texture assumes non-rounded shapes and can form irregular areas of the cement \n\ncovering large extensions of the interganular space (Figure 8.7). As the peloids can occur \n\nbetween and within the detrital material and the bioclasts, and given the lack of indications \n\nof transportation of the peloids, the peloidal fabric is interpreted as having an in situ origin \n\nand not as of fecal origin. The space between the peloidal clots is predominantly filled by \n\nmicritic to micro-spar carbonate cement, and the cores of the peloids are composed of \n\nsubmicron to micron-sized anhedral carbonate grains. In thin section, the peloids display \n\nlight brownish grey to dark colours and in cathodoluminescence they have non-\n\nluminescent dull to medium colours, that are interpreted as indicating remains of organic \n\nmatter. \n\nThe peloids are therefore considered to represent bacterially induced precipitates \n\nwhere an association of micritic mineralogies, probably with more abundant microbial \n\nremains, composes the authigenic cement. Co-occurrence of pyrite within the peloids is \n\nfrequent and indicates anaerobic conditions, where the organic compounds (most probably \n\nlight hydrocarbons, such as methane) are anaerobically oxidized. The peloidal-like fabric \n\nof the dolomite chimneys, similar to the fabrics described in other active or fossil cold seep \n\nsystems (Peckmann et al., 2002) are, interpreted here as representing clusters or fragments \n\nof clusters of higher concentrations of microbial consortia. \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 301\n\n \nFigure 8.7.

Biomarker and SEM evidences of microbial mediation in the formation of MDAC in the \nGulf of Cadiz \n\n 302 \n\nMicrobial filaments \n\nLocally, high densities of unidentified filaments with diameters of about 0.5 \u00b5m and \n\nup to 100 \u00b5m long occur in the dolomite chimneys (Figure 8.8). These filaments form \n\ncomplex networks that appear to be cemented by the authigenic carbonate cement crystals \n\n(Figure 8.8C) and are therefore proposed to be contemporary of the carbonate cement \n\nformation and not as resulting from a later stage contamination. \n\nLinear clusters of small crystals with sizes ranging from 0.1 to 2-3 \u00b5m in diameter \n\nare also observed (Figure 8.9A-B). These structures are interpreted as being formed by \n\ncalcification over filamentous structures (biomineralizations) since their size and shapes \n\nresemble bacterial morphologies. These calcified filaments are incorporated and \n\nsurrounded by larger cement crystals and therefore are clearly contemporary to the cement \n\nprecipitation (Figure 8.9B). Similar crystals clusters, not showing linear arrangements, are \n\nalso observed on top of some larger crystals (Figure 8.9C). Individual crystals or sub-\n\nspherical particles with less than 0.1 \u00b5m in diameter are also observed as being cemented \n\nand incorporated in the cement crystals as illustrated in (Figure 8.9D), where a fragment of \n\na nanofossil appears to have been cemented and incorporated in a cemented crystal. \n\nParticles with shapes that possibly indicate a microbial origin \n\nSeveral other structures with a probable biogenic origin are also frequently observed \n\non the dolomite chimney samples. \n\nAssociated with the filaments agglomerates of cocci, straight and curved rod-shaped \n\nand sub-spherical carbonate phases are also frequently found (Figure 8.8A-B pinpointed by \n\nblack arrows, Figure 8.10A-C and Figure 8.11A pinpointed by white arrows). The rods and \n\nsub-spherical structures have sizes ranging from 0.1 to 1 \u00b5m in diameter and are less than 3 \n\n\u00b5m long. Because of their simple morphology the cocci and rods are possibly of bacterial \n\norigin, as their size an shapes are compatible with the size and shapes of bacteria. The rod-\n\nshapped agglomerates have very similar compositions to the calcitic micrite cement \n\n(Figure 8.10B and F) and the rods are locally being incorporated into the calcite cement \n\ncrystals, as illustrated in Figure 8.10C and pinpointed by the arrows. It should be noted that \n\nthese agglomerates of rod-shaped morphologies have a similar morphology to the radial \n\nstructures illustrated in Figure 8.11B-E, but with significant differences. While the rods in \n\nthe rod-shaped agglomerates have a random orientation, in the radial structures the rods are \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 303\n\nparallel and have a regular divergent distribution. The radial structures have diameters \n\nranging from 10 to 20 \u00b5m and, similarly to the rod-shaped agglomerates, are interpreted as \n\nbeing biogenic in origin, although their nature is more difficult to determine. They can be \n\nsections of spicules or they can be bacterial in origin. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 8.8. SEM imagery illustrating microbial filaments on dolomite chimney samples.

Globular morphologies that resemble dumbbells (illustrated in \n\nFigure 8.13A-B) 4-5 \u00b5m long, were observed as sub-spherical particles with a diameter of \n\n2-5 \u00b5m (Figure 8.13C-D). Fragments of tubular morphologies with 10 \u00b5m in diameter \n\nwere also recognised (Figure 8.13E). \n\nIt was also possible to identify morphologies that resemble twisted clotted surfaces \n\nor sheaths, 2-3 \u00b5m thick (Figure 8.13F), with globular grains, some of which are probably \n\npyrite framboids (1-5 \u00b5m in diameter) being cemented on these sheaths. These clotted \n\nsurfaces are probably calcified biofilms and some of the globular grains on their surface \n\nare bacterial rods being cemented into the sheaths.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 307\n\n \nFigure 8.13.

Also difficult to \n\ninterpret but also supporting a biogenic origin, these euhedral cement crystals are \n\nfrequently found growing over a surface of sub-micron carbonate phase that cements the \n\nsurface of some detrital grains. These carbonate surfaces have 2-4 \u00b5m thick and exhibit a \n\nmicro-rugose texture. The euhedral crystals seem to being growing from this surface, \n\nwhich can be interpreted as a calcified biofilm. \n\nIn some of these euhedral cement crystals with 2-3 \u00b5m in diameter are growing and \n\nincorporating sub-spherical agglomerates of euhedral crystals with 0.5 \u00b5m size and \n\npossibly pyrite framboids (Figure 8.15B) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 309\n\n \nFigure 8.15.

Their mineralogy is dominated by aragonite and calcite, cementing a \n\ndetrital fraction of quartz, feldspars, clays, mud volcano mud breccia clasts, shell \n\nfragments, foraminifera and calcareous nannofossils. Aragonite crusts and pavements are \n\nin general tabular (as revealed by the retrieved samples and on the underwater video \n\nobservations) or form irregular block like or buildups at the seafloor. Different lithologic \n\ntypes of aragonite pavements have been identified (see Chapter 5): (i) lithified mud \n\n\n\nChapter 8. Biomarker and SEM evidences of microbial mediation in the formation of MDAC in the \nGulf of Cadiz \n\n 310 \n\nvolcano breccias; (ii) shell crusts; (iii) intraformational breccias; and (iv) lithified \n\nfragments of dolomite crusts and chimneys. Several of these sub-types can coexist at the \n\nsame location and sometimes in the same sample. \n\nThe aragonite pavement samples, as illustrated for example in Figure 8.16, are \n\ncharacterized by a complex variety of macro and micro fabrics that developed at different \n\ntimes and where is possible to identify primary and later minerals. Dissolution horizons are \n\nalso found in these samples, in opposition to the fabric of the dolomite crusts and \n\nchimneys, where no dissolution surfaces where found. The dissolution surfaces of the \n\naragonite pavements indicate oxidation-reduction changes in the geochemical environment \n\nduring their formation. The different aragonite pavements are characterized by the \n\npresence of two carbonate cement phases: the peloidal and clotted microfabrics, and the \n\nbotryoidal and fibrous stromatolitic microfabric. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 8.16. (A) Transversal cut of an aragonite pavement where is possible to recognise a dissolution \n\nsurface and veins filled by pure aragonite cement (B) with botryoidal and stromatolitic layers (C). \n\n \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 311\n\nPeloidal and clotted microfabrics \n\nThe peloidal and clotted microfabrics correspond to the earliest stage cement phase. \n\nIt consists of clotted micrite and pelmicrite cement, composed of micritic clots with calcite, \n\nhigh Mg-calcite and aragonite (pointed by cm in Figure 8.17). It is very similar to the \n\nfabric of the dolomite chimneys. This fabric is characterized by an abundant detrital \n\ncomponent, in general dominated by bioclasts of planktonic and benthic foraminifera, \n\nostracods and nonofossils, with silty terrigenous grains of quartz, calcite, feldspars, apatite, \n\nzircon and clays. Iron and manganese oxy-hydroxides are present in some samples, \n\nstaining them with a variable brownish colour depending on the degree of oxidation of the \n\nsample; however, in general the aragonite pavements with no signs of oxidation are the \n\nmost frequent. This microfabric is characterized by the abundance of peloidal-like clotts, as \n\nillustrated in Figure 8.19. The aragonitic and calcitic micritic clots have irregular shapes \n\nand sizes, and a cloudy internal texture. The size of most clots ranges from 50 to 500 \u00b5m in \n\ndiameter. The clots form an important fraction of the carbonate cement and, in general, the \n\nspace between the clots is filled by micrite to star aragonite and calcite cement, or by \n\nfibrous stromatolitic and botryoidal aragonite. Frequently, the interior of foraminifera \n\nbioclasts have similar clotted microfabric. In the clots and peloidal-like structures the \n\noccurrence of organic matter is interpreted to be significant. \n\nAuthigenic pyrite is abundant in this fabric, occurring as isolated framboids with up \n\nto 30 \u00b5m in diameter, as framboidal aggregates (Figure 8.17) with up to 200 \u00b5m in \n\ndiameter, or as individual euhedral crystals. Pyrite occurs with high density in the clots and \n\nin the peloidal-like structures and it also often completely infills some foraminifera shells \n\n(Figure 8.19C, E-F). Pyrite, most probably associated with organic matter, occurs \n\nfrequently as forming layers at the margins of material with clotted micritic fabric and on \n\ntop of which aragonite needles grow, forming botryoidal and stromatolithic layers (Figure \n\n8.17D and F pinpointed by the arrows). \n\nThe clotted pelmicrite fabrics are interpreted as being biogenic (microbial) related \n\nfabric. \n\nBotryoidal and fibrous stromatolitic microfabric \n\nThe botryoidal and isopachous fibrous stromatolitic microfabrics correspond to a \n\nlater cementation stage by acicular (almost pure) aragonite that fills the pore spaces, \n\n\n\nChapter 8. Biomarker and SEM evidences of microbial mediation in the formation of MDAC in the \nGulf of Cadiz \n\n 312 \n\nfractures and open cracks, frequently forming botryoidal and stromatolitic layers (Figure \n\n8.17 and Figure 8.18).  \n\nThe botryoids are characterized by a radial texture of the aragonite needles (Figure \n\n8.20A-C). that can  have sizes ranging from 100 to 300 \u00b5m in length. They grow over the \n\nclotted micrite cement and fill in the open porosity and open voids. \n\nFibrous stromatolitic microfabric characteristically occurs as infilling large porous, \n\nfractures and cavities. The stromatolitic microfabric is formed by isopachous aragonite \n\nneedles, occurring as a single or as multiple layers that recover the cavities walls and form \n\nstromatolitic crusts. This microfabric is composed of almost pure aragonite and can have \n\nthicknesses of 100 \u00b5m up to 0.9 cm and can fill cavities and fractures with a thickness of \n\nup to 2-3 cm. The nature and characteristics of the stromatolitic cavities are discussed \n\nbelow. \n\nThe stromatolitic layers, like the botryoidal fabric, represent a later cementation \n\nphase as they grow over the clotted micritic fabric, filling open spaces. In thin section, they \n\nfrequently exhibit horizons or layers of clotted fabric within the aragonite needles layers or \n\nat the centre of the stromatolitic cavities (Figure 8.20C-F). These cloudy horizons are \n\ninterpreted as possibly corresponding to levels with a high amount of organic content, \n\nprobably corresponding to the calcified biofilms, such as the ones illustrated by SEM \n\nimagery on Figure 8.26.  \n\nChaotic fabrics, dissolution horizons and stromatolitic cavities \n\nSamples of intraformational breccias, characterized by a chaotic fabric produced by \n\nin situ brecciation, and samples of lithified fragments of dolomite crusts and chimneys, are \n\nboth characterized by the presence of mega-clasts (up to 12 cm) cemented by the \n\nauthigenic aragonite and calcite cement described above. As described in Chapter 5, the \n\nclasts of the intraformational breccias are interpreted as fragments of previous semi-\n\nconsolidated aragonite pavements that were fractured and later re-cemented. The \n\nfragmentation and the generation of the clasts can be interpreted as resulting from \n\ninstability related to mud volcano activity, where episodes of mud breccia extrusion, gas \n\nand fluids emissions can fracture the aragonite pavements being formed close to the \n\nseafloor. Alternatively, gas hydrate formation and subsequent dissociation can also \n\nproduce the fragmentation of the pavements, similar to the gas hydrate associated \n\ncarbonates found in the Cascadia margin (Bohrmann et al., 1998; Greinert et al., 2001). \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 313\n\nThe intraformational breccia clasts frequently show signs of dissolution and corroded \n\nedges (Figure 8.18D, E and F). This puts in evidence that after an episode of MDAC \n\nformation, changes in the geochemical environment happened, leading to carbonate \n\ndissolution. Possibly this is evidencing a phase of aerobic oxidation of methane that \n\ninduces an increase in the pore water CO2 content and leads to the acidification of the pore \n\nwaters leading to the dissolution conditions. After this episode, adequate conditions for \n\nanaerobic oxidation of methane occur, leading to a new episode of cementation of the \n\nmega-clasts by a new generation of authigenic carbonates. \n\nIn general, the degree of authigenic carbonate cementation is not pervasive and inter-\n\ngranular pore spaces are frequent; therefore, the aragonite pavements exhibit, in general, \n\nhigh porosity. The aragonite pavement samples frequently have voids, fractures and open \n\ncracks that are recovered or totally filled by crusts or layers of stromatolitic and botryoidal \n\naragonite microfabrics, described above and illustrated in Figure 8.16, Figure 8.17A, \n\nFigure 8.18A and Figure 8.20. These cavities frequently have sheet to lenses shapes, \n\noccurring parallel to the stratification or to the global planar shape of the pavement sample. \n\nThey can have thicknesses ranging from 1 mm to 2-3 cm and can extent for more than 12 \n\ncm in length. The shape of these voids and the subsequent aragonite layers resembles to the \n\naspect of the gas hydrates chunks and layers that were recovered from mud volcanoes in \n\nthe Gulf of Cadiz (Kenyon et al., 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003; Pinheiro et al., 2003; Kenyon et \n\nal., 2006) and also from other settings (Suess et al., 1999; Suess et al., 2001). Therefore \n\nthe stromatolitic and botryoidal aragonite fabrics are interpreted as the remains of lenses of \n\ngas hydrates layers that grow within the sediments, occurring as planar layers parallel to \n\nthe stratification of the sediments as also suggested for similar sample fabrics (Bohrmann \n\net al., 1998). After the dissociation of these gas hydrate layers, their morphology is \n\nregistered by the layers of almost pure aragonite illustrated in Figure 8.16. \n\nThe pelmicrite and intrapelsparite, with clotted cement fabric and aragonite \n\nbotryoids, isopachous needles and stromatolitic layers or crusts observed in the aragonite \n\npavements from the Gulf of Cadiz are also typical of other active and fossil methane seeps \n\n(Savard et al., 1996; Bohrmann et al., 1998; Campbell et al., 2002; Shapiro and Fricke, \n\n2002; Shapiro, 2002; Shapiro, 2004).  \n\n\n\nChapter 8.

Biomarker and SEM evidences of microbial mediation in the formation of MDAC in the \nGulf of Cadiz \n\n 320 \n\n \n\nMicrobial filaments \n\nUnidentified filaments with diameters of about 1 \u00b5m and up to 15 \u00b5m in length were \n\nfrequently observed by SEM within the aragonite pavement cements (Figure 8.23). Two \n\ndistinct types of filaments can be identified: (1) strait linear filaments with a very smooth \n\nexternal surface, illustrated in Figure 8.23E-G, very similar to the filaments observed on \n\nthe dolomitic crusts and chimney samples (8.3.1.1: Microbial filaments); and (2) sinuous \n\nfilaments that have curve shapes and a more rough (unpolished) exterior (Figure 8.23A-D), \n\nsome of then seam to being calcified, cemented and incorporated by the authigenic cement \n\n(Figure 8.23H). Some of these sinuous filaments are boll capped filaments or exhibit boll \n\ncaps or coccoids (with &lt;1 \u00b5m in diameter) over them. Because the filaments, in particular \n\nthe sinuous filaments have shapes and sizes similar to bacteria and are similar to the \n\nfossilized bacteria filaments enclosed in several modern seep carbonates (Peckmann et al., \n\n2001b; Shapiro, 2004; Reitner et al., 2005), they are interpreted as fossilized microbial \n\nfilaments. The microbial filaments can occur isolated between the aragonite fibers or as \n\ndenser clusters, such as that in Figure 8.23H. \n\nIt was also possible to identify some open tubular structures, such as the one \n\nillustrated in Figure 8.24A with a similar diameter to the microbial filaments (of about 1 \n\n\u00b5m). Tubular holes with larger diameters of 3 to 5 \u00b5m are also frequently observed, which \n\nare interpreted as scavenger holes by unidentified organisms (Figure 8.24B-D). \n\nIndividual coccoids or boll caps are spherical to sub-spherical structures with 0.5-1 \n\n\u00b5m in diameter that occur isolated, associated with filaments or forming coccoid clusters. \n\nWhile many different processes, including abiogenic processes, can be considered to \n\nexplain the formation of the spherical structures, their sizes are equivalent to the sizes of \n\nmodern bacteria and archaea (Boetius et al., 2000); their occurrence, associated with \n\nmicrobial filaments and biofilms, and their EDS chemical composition with higher carbon \n\ncontent, compared with the involved carbonate cement, suggests a biogenic origin for the \n\ncoccoids. \n\n \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 321\n\n \nFigure 8.23.

PMI is produced by Archaea (Thiel \n\net al., 1999) especially by methanogens, thermoacidophilics and methanogens. \n\nSqualane is present and depleted in 13C (-64\u2030 VPDB; Figure 8.27). Although \n\nsqualane is not an unquestionable AOM marker, as it can have various sources, such \n\nstrongly depleted 13C value indicates that methane must be the carbon source for this \n\nbiomarker and it is most probably indicating AOM archaea. Possibly, squalane is a good \n\nand promising marker for the degradation of squalene, which is a polyunsaturated \n\nprecursor of Squalane. \n\nCrocetane was not detected in this sample. The fact that this compound was detected \n\non sample 3463-A08 (that presents a lower oxidation intensity), can be interpreted as an \n\nindicator of the degradation intensity. The degradation intensity in sample 3722-A33 is \n\nhigher and therefore only the final and more resistant AOM markers remain. \n\nOther small peaks of isoprenoids, such as Pristane are present but just in trace \n\nquantities that do not allow the measurement of the 13C isotopic composition. Aliphatic n-\n\nalkanes are also present: the short ones are produced by eukaryotes and the long ones by \n\nland plants. These compounds are allochthonous markers from eukaryotes and land plants. \n\nThe uneven chains (C27, C29 and C31) predominate over the short ones, indicating relatively \n\nfresh biomarker material from the detrital organic mater. \n\n \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 325\n\n \nFigure 8.27.

Biomarker and SEM evidences of microbial mediation in the formation of MDAC in the \nGulf of Cadiz \n\n 328 \n\nCrocetane is also present. It is one of the dominant peaks in the sample and presents \n\nvery depleted isotopic 13C ratio (-132.27\u2030 VPDB). Crocetane:1, the monounsaturated \n\nversion of crocetane, is also present with a 13C ratio of -50\u2030 VPDB. Squalane is present \n\nbut it is not as depleted as in the dolomite chimney samples. Squalane presents a 13C ratio \n\nof -40\u2030 VPDB. The short-chain n-alkanes are more abundant than the long-chain alkanes. \n\nThere is also a stronger presence of eukariotes and less input of terrestrial material in this \n\nsample. Therefore the terrestrial input on the aragonite pavements seems to be less than the \n\nterrestrial input on the dolomite chimneys. \n\nSample GeoB 9029-3 \n\nAragonite pavement samples from the Faro mud volcano (MV) yielded archaeal \n\nbiomarkers such as crocetane/phytane with depleted isotopic 13C values (-110\u2030 VPDB), \n\nand Archaeal sn2-hydroxyarchaeol, also depleted in 13C (Table 8.3). PMI (with a 13C ratio \n\nof -111\u2030 VPDB) as mono-, di- and triunsaturated PMI are also present in this sample, all \n\nwith depleted isotopic 13C values. \n\nSeveral bacterial lipid biomarkers, such as the i-C15:0; ai-C15:0; C16:1?5; C17:1?6 that \n\nhave been described as related to SRB (Elvert et al., 2003), are present in this aragonite \n\npavement sample. The bacterial lipid biomarkers that could be analysed are strongly \n\ndepleted in 13C, with values ranging from -95 to -99\u2030 VPDB (Table 8.3). \n\nIn this sample, the archaeal and bacterial lipids biomarkers occur in similar \n\nconcentrations (Niemann et al., 2006). \n\nSample GeoB 9023-1  \n\nThe aragonite pavement sample from Hesperides MV shows stronger oxidation \n\nintensity than the aragonite pavement from both Faro and Ginsburg MVs. Probably \n\nbecause of this, the bacterial fatty acids (FA) and the archaeal biomarkers from the \n\nHesperides MV were found in much lower amount than in Faro MV. \n\nThe most common bacterial FAs in the Hesperides MV were the C16:0 and C18:0, \n\ncompounds, which are not associated with SRB. The lipid biomarkers associated with SRB \n\n(Elvert et al., 2003) found in this sample were i-C15:0; ai-C15:0 and C16:1?5, showing ?13C \n\nvalues less depleted than those values recorded on samples from the Hesperides MV \n\n(Table 8.3). \n\n \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 329\n\nTable 8.3.

The co-formation of the authigenic carbonates and authigenic pyrite with ?34S \n\nnegative values (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2006a, b) indicates an anaerobic geochemical \n\nenvironment with sulphate-reducing bacterial activity promoting the sulphide precipitation \n\nin anoxic sediment conditions. Therefore, the oxidation of methane that lead to the \n\nalkalinity increase and subsequent formation of the authigenic carbonates had to be \n\nreached through the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). \n\nAs the dolomite chimneys, crusts and nodules do not evidence any signs of \n\ndissolution episodes and subsequent phase of cementation, this support the model (as \n\nproposed in Chapter 5) that the dolomite dominated MDAC are formed at a deeper \n\nlocations within the sedimentary column. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 331\n\n \nFigure 8.29. Schematic diagram illustrating the chemical environment during the formation of the authigenic \n\ncarbonates (phase A and B). In (C) a change in the chemical environment occurs due to destabilization of gas \n\nhydrate layers that promotes the fracturation of the incipient aragonite pavements and subsequent ventilation \n\nof the system by seawater and consequent change of the environment to an oxic phase. This phase can be \n\nfollowed by a new phase (D) of authigenic carbonate formation leading to the re-cementation of the MDAC \n\nfragments. \n\n \nFigure 8.30. Schematic diagram illustrating the chemical environment during the formation of the authigenic \n\ncarbonates considering multiple episodes of mud volcano mud breccia extrusion episodes.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 8. Biomarker and SEM evidences of microbial mediation in the formation of MDAC in the \nGulf of Cadiz \n\n 332 \n\nThe dolomite chimneys, crusts and nodules do not exhibit any textural or microfabric \n\ncharacteristics that indicate a change in the geochemical conditions (as dissolution \n\nepisodes and subsequent phases of cementation). Some of than exhibit discontinuities not \n\nrelated to dissolution phases but interpreted as resulting from lithologic changes in the \n\ninitial sediment from which the carbonate was formed or discontinuities that were \n\ninterpreted as resulting most probably from variations on the cementation as consequence \n\nof variation of the methane flux supply. Therefore the dolomitic carbonates are interpreted \n\nas corresponding to a more confined environment of formation, most probably within the \n\nfirst meters of the sedimentary column (as discussed in Chapter 5). \n\nAs some of the aragonite pavements show frequent dissolution events, this is an \n\nindicator of the variability of the environmental conditions and probably of changes to \n\naerobic conditions, with periods of aerobic methane oxidation that lead to increase in \n\nacidity of the pore waters and carbonate dissolution instead of carbonate formation. This is \n\ninterpreted as indicating a more ventilated (by seawater) environment, most probably \n\ncloser to the seafloor, during the formation of the aragonite pavements. These dissolution \n\nevents can be interpreted as corresponding to episodes of increased seawater ventilation. \n\nThese episodes can result from: (1) a mechanical destabilization of the system by \n\ndissociation of gas hydrate layers in the shallow subsurface (as illustrated in Figure 8.29); \n\n(2) mechanical destabilization of the system as result of mud breccia eruptions within a \n\nmud volcano (as illustrated in Figure 8.30) or (3) by a reduction of the methane flux, \n\nallowing the sulphate and oxygen diffusion from seawater deeper into the sediment \n\ncolumn. The two first processes can lead to ruptures of the carbonate cap of the aragonite \n\npavements, leading to their brecciation and consequent increase of seawater ventilation and \n\nchanging the chemical environment from anoxic to oxic conditions. \n\n \n\n8.4.2 Microfabrics and microbial fossil evidences \n\nThe petrographic and SEM observations discussed in this chapter revealed large \n\namounts of structures and textures that clearly indicate microbial activity during the \n\nformation of the MDAC. \n\nThe carbonate cement of the MDAC, in both the dolomitic and aragonitic samples is \n\ncharacterized by a dominance of clotted microfabric that corresponds to the \u201cstructure \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 333\n\ngrumeleuse\u201d described by Cayeux (1935) whose genesis and significance have been object \n\nof discussion (Shapiro, 2000; Peckmann et al., 2002; Shapiro and Fricke, 2002; Shapiro, \n\n2002; Shapiro, 2004). This term is used to designate aggregates of cloudy, irregular, \n\nmicritic authigenic carbonate (aragonite, calcite, Mg-calcite and dolomite) cement, primary \n\nin origin and where authigenic pyrite and probably organic compounds are abundant. This \n\nmicrofabric has been recorded in association with several active and fossil seep carbonates \n\n(Shapiro, 2000; Peckmann et al., 2001c; Peckmann et al., 2002; Shapiro and Fricke, 2002; \n\nShapiro, 2002). Furthermore, the presence of clotted microfabric in both aragonitic and \n\ndolomitic carbonated indicates that this fabric is not specific of a particular mineralogy but \n\nit is specific of a particular genesis. The clotted fabrics of different scales are interpreted as \n\ntypical features of microbial origin (Burne and Moore, 1987; Shapiro, 2000; Shapiro and \n\nAwramik, 2000; Peckmann et al., 2002; Shapiro and Fricke, 2002; Shapiro, 2002; Shapiro, \n\n2004). Given their irregular shape, the spatial arrangement of the clots and the higher \n\nabundance of pyrite and organic compounds, the clots are interpreted as indicative of \n\nformation in microenvironments of geochemical adequate conditions that were controlled \n\nby microbial metabolism. Therefore this microfabric is interpreted as an evidence of \n\nmicrobial mediation in the formation of the authigenic carbonates, particularly in the \n\ninitiation of the carbonate precipitation. \n\nSEM observations of the cement of the dolomite crusts, chimneys and nodules \n\n(which consist of minor aggregates of rhombohedric calcite, high-Mg calcite and dolomite, \n\nup to 10 \u00b5m in diameter) allowed the identification of a large variety of other microbial-\n\ninduced morphologies and fabrics, such as: (1) microbial filaments; (2) high Mg-calcite \n\nand dolomite crystal aggregates calcifying and mimetizing filaments, some of them being \n\nincorporated by dolomite and calcite crystals; (3) rods with brush-like terminations; (4) \n\nstructures that resemble dumbbell-like and cauliflower morphologies. The precipitation of \n\ndumbbell-like and cauliflower crystal aggregates have been induced by bacterial activity in \n\nlaboratory experiments using sulphate-reducing bacteria (Vasconcelos et al., 1995; \n\nWarthmann et al., 2000). The observed microbial filaments and structures in the observed \n\naggregates match the typical size of the features described in the bacterially laboratory \n\nauthigenic carbonates precipitation experiments and are clearly constructive in origin. The \n\nfilaments that are covered by the 50 nm to 1 \u00b5m size rhombohedra of calcite, Mg-calcite or \n\ndolomite and that are being incorporated by larger (5-10 \u00b5m) dolomite rhombohedra can \n\n\n\nChapter 8. Biomarker and SEM evidences of microbial mediation in the formation of MDAC in the \nGulf of Cadiz \n\n 334 \n\nbe interpreted as corresponding to nucleation points from where the dolomite precipitation \n\nstarted and from which it progressed. The lack of any crystallographic form or indication \n\nof cleavage of the rods and brush-like terminations and the similarity of the size of these \n\nfeatures with the typical bacteria sizes indicates to a biotic origin. Therefore, the \n\norganogenic dolomite formation model, proposed for dolomite formation in shallow \n\ncoastal lagunall and shallow marine environments (Vasconcelos et al., 1995) or in organic \n\nrich and deep marine sediments (Meister, 2005), is also proposed for the formation of the \n\nMDAC in the Gulf of Cadiz. \n\nIn the aragonite pavements, SEM observations also allowed the identification of \n\nsimilar microbial-induced morphologies and fabrics, such as: (1) microbial filaments; (2) \n\nrods with brush-like terminations; (3) aragonite batons, ball-capped batons and nanograins; \n\n(4) microbial and mucous biofilms occurring as a coating, draped between the aragonite \n\nfibres and needles of the stromatolitic layers; (5) the biotic origin of the pelmicrite clotted \n\npeloidal fabric; and (5) microbial filaments probably representing morphological bacteria \n\nremains. \n\nSamples of aragonite pavements frequently have botryoidal and stromatolitic fabrics \n\nthat recover or totally fill cavities, fractures and open pore spaces. This fabric is similar to \n\nthe stromatolitic fabrics reported from several active seep carbonates (Greinert et al., 2001; \n\nPeckmann et al., 2001b; Greinert et al., 2002) and to the stromatactoid fabric reported from \n\nseveral fossil seep carbonates (Peckmann et al., 2001a; Peckmann et al., 2002; Shapiro and \n\nFricke, 2002). These reported stromatolitic and stromatactoid fabrics are described as \n\ninfilling cavities and the cement (calcite or aragonite) grows in direction towards the \n\nsource of energy (methane), which is downwards. This produces a smooth upper surface \n\nand an irregular lower surface of the reported stromatolitic and stromatactoid fabrics. In the \n\naragonite samples from the Gulf of Cadiz, this growth criteria is not so clear and instead \n\nthe stromatolitic and botryoidal layers seem to grow from the wall of the cavity towards \n\ntheir centre. Because much of the stromatolitic and botryoidal layers have shapes and sizes \n\nthat resemble the shapes and sizes of the gas hydrate pieces collected from the mud breccia \n\nsediments in some mud volcanoes from the Gulf of Cadiz, the formation of the cavities \n\n(specially the sub-horizontal cavities and fractures) is interpreted as being generated by gas \n\nhydrate formation, inducing the fracturation of the unconsolidated or semi-cemented \n\nsediments. Subsequent dissociation of these gas hydrates and anaerobic oxidation of \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 335\n\nresultant methane induced the precipitation of the stromatolitic and botryoidal layers. As \n\nthe gas hydrate dissociation had to progress from the periphery of the gas hydrate chunks \n\ntowards their centres, the authigenic cementations will also have the same trend. \n\n \n\n8.4.3 Biomarker significance \n\nSpecific 13C-depleted lipid biomarkers have been identified in the dolomite chimney \n\nsamples. These biomarkers include tail-to-tail linked acyclic isoprenoids such as PMI \n\n(2,6,10,15,19-pentamethyleicosane), pristine, phytane/crocetane and squalane \n\n(2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyl-tetracosane). These compounds derive from archaea involved \n\nin the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). \n\nThe aragonite crusts showed even better preserved biomarker patterns in comparison \n\nwith the chimney dolomites. PMI (?13C value: -101\u2030) are accompanied by unsaturated \n\nderivatives with 1 to 3 double bonds (PMI?; -75\u2030). Isotopically-depleted PMI represents \n\nthe most widespread and persistent hydrocarbon biomarker for AOM-performing archaea \n\n(Peckmann and Thiel, 2004). Crocetane is present as one of the dominant peaks, strongly \n\ndepleted in 13C (-132.27\u2030). Crocetane:1, the monounsaturated version of crocetane, is also \n\npresent with a 13C ratio of -50\u2030. Squalane is present but not so depleted as in the previous \n\nbiomarkers. Archaeol and hydroxyarchaeol were also detected with depleted in 13C \n\ncompositions. \n\nBacterial lipid biomarkers, strongly depleted in 13C, with values ranging from -95 to -\n\n99\u2030 VPDB, that have been described as related with SRB, were identified on the \n\naragonite pavement samples. The archaeal and bacterial lipids biomarkers occur in \n\ncomparable concentrations (Niemann et al., 2006). \n\nAlthough the exact biochemical pathway of AOM still remains unclear, molecular, \n\nisotopic and phylogenetic evidence revealed that AOM is performed by a consortium of \n\nmethanotrophic archaea and sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) (Peckmann et al., 1999b; \n\nBoetius et al., 2000; Elvert et al., 2000; Peckmann et al., 2001b; Peckmann et al., 2001c). \n\nThe biomarkers identified on both aragonite pavements and dolomite chimneys indicate \n\nthe presence of an AOM-SR consortium. Therefore, this microbial activity has an active \n\nand important role on the definition of the bio-geochemical conditions that has lead to the \n\nprecipitation of the authigenic carbonates. \n\n\n\nChapter 8. Biomarker and SEM evidences of microbial mediation in the formation of MDAC in the \nGulf of Cadiz \n\n 336 \n\n8.5 Conclusions \n\n \n\nThe different types of MDAC from the Gulf of Cadiz include (as discussed in \n\nChapter 5): dolomite crusts, dolomite nodules, chimneys or filled burrows, and aragonitic \n\nslabs or pavements. They all correspond to the cementation of sediments through the \n\nprecipitation of authigenic carbonates and the different lithologic types correspond to \n\ndifferent geochemical environments of formation. The dolomitic samples consist of \n\nmicrocrystalline dolomite cements with subordinate high and low magnesium calcite \n\ncementing a detrital pelagic fraction composed mainly of quartz and minor feldspar, clays, \n\nbioclasts of planktonic foraminifera (globigerinoids), ostracods, and pellets. The aragonite \n\npavements form tabular to nodular precipitates consisting mainly of aragonite and calcite \n\ncementing mud volcano mud breccias, shells and clasts from previous generations of \n\ncrusts, and detrital quartz, clays and bioclasts of planktonic foraminifera. Authigenic \n\ncarbonates with depleted ?13C values indicate the oxidation of methane as the major carbon \n\nsource. Authigenic pyrite also occurs, with ?34S negative values indicating an anaerobic \n\ngeochemical environment with sulphate-reducing bacterial activity promoting sulphide \n\nprecipitation in anoxic sediment conditions. \n\nThe presence of clotted microfabric in both aragonitic and dolomitic carbonate \n\ncements is interpreted as indicating microbial mediation in the formation of the authigenic \n\ncarbonates, particularly in the initiation of the carbonate precipitation. This interpretation is \n\nalso supported by other observable structures such as: microbial filaments; high Mg-calcite \n\nand dolomite crystal aggregates calcifying and mimetizing filaments, some of them being \n\nincorporated by dolomite and calcite crystals; rods with brush-like terminations; dumbbell-\n\nlike and cauliflower morphologies; aragonite batons, ball-capped batons and nanograins; \n\nmicrobial and mucous biofilms forming coatings, draped between the aragonite fibres and \n\nneedles of the stromatolitic layers; and microbial filaments probably representing \n\nmorphological bacteria remains. \n\nSpecific 13C-depleted lipid biomarkers were identified in the dolomite chimney \n\nsamples. They include tail-to-tail linked acyclic isoprenoids such as PMI (2,6,10,15,19-\n\npentamethyleicosane) and squalane (2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyltetracosane). These \n\ncompounds derive from archaea involved in the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). \n\nThe aragonite crusts showed even better preserved biomarker patterns in comparison with \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 337\n\nthe dolomite chimneys. PMI (?13C = -101\u2030 VPDB) is accompanied by unsaturated \n\nderivatives with 1 to 3 double bonds (PMI? = -75\u2030 VPDB). Isotopically-depleted PMI \n\nrepresents the most widespread and persistent hydrocarbon biomarker for AOM-\n\nperforming archaea. Bacterial lipid biomarkers strongly depleted in 13C, with values \n\nranging from -95 to -99\u2030 VPDB, occur in comparable concentrations to the archaea lipid \n\nbiomarkers, and have been described as related to sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB). \n\nThe results of the SEM observations and biomarker analysis show that microbes, \n\nconsortia of Archaea/SRB had an active key role in the formation of authigenic carbonates. \n\nAn organogenic model is proposed not only for the dolomite precipitation but also for the \n\nformation of the remaining authigenic carbonates (aragonite, calcite and Mg-calcite). The \n\nmicrobial activity most probably created optimal micro-environmental geochemical \n\nconditions, most probably around the microbial structures, from where the precipitation of \n\nthe MDAC is initiated. \n\nThe presence of the stromatolitic and botryoidal fabrics further support the \n\nindications that the formation and dissociation of gas hydrates was a process that was \n\nactively involved during the precipitation of the authigenic carbonates (Chapter 6). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 338 \n\n \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 339\n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 9.  Main Conclusions, Future work and Open questions \n \n\n \n\n9.1 Main conclusions \n\n \n\nFluid escape structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n \nThe fluid escape structures from the Gulf of Cadiz show a high degree of geologic \n\nand biologic variability associated with the type, intensity and duration of the fluid fluxes. \n\nThe fluid escape structures observed in the Gulf of Cadiz include active and inactive mud \n\nvolcanoes, mud diapirs, pockmarks and hydrocarbon seeps recorded by the methane-\n\nderived authigenic carbonates (MDAC). \n\n \nIn the Gulf of Cadiz the fluids and gases are mainly vertically focused through faults \n\nand along the mud volcano conduits, since the gas hydrates, the MDAC and the \n\nchemosynthetic communities are essentially found within the mud volcano edifices (Porto, \n\nFaro, Darwin, Fiuza, Yuma, Ginsburg, Jesus Baraza, Kidd, Meknes, Mercator, Shouen and \n\nStudent), the mud cones (Iberico, Cornide), the diapiric ridges (Formoza Ridge, \n\nGudalquivir Diapiric Ridge and Hormigas Ridge) and the fault scarps (Pen Duick, \n\nVernarsky ridge, Ridge W Gibraltar, Cadiz channel). Moreover, no regionally bottom \n\nsimulating reflectors were found until now. \n\n \nThe fluid escape structures from the Gulf of Cadiz and associated chemosynthetic \n\ncommunities, exhibit different manifestations corresponding to different phases of activity. \n\nThey can represent a mud-prone phase of mud breccia extrusion with the rapid \n\nemplacement of mud flows, or they can locally consist of phases of moderate fluid flux, \n\ndominated by water and gas, resulting in the accumulation of shallow gas hydrates, the \n\ncementation of the mud breccia sediments, the formation of other types of MDAC, and the \n\nsupport of associated chemosynthetic communities. Through time, a mud volcano can \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 9.  Main Conclusions, Future work and Open questions \n\n 340 \n\nsuccessively go through different phases of activity with different manifestations (as \n\nproposed on the schematic model in Figure 4.51, Chapter 4). \n\n \n\nMDAC occurrences and their controls \n\n \nAs interpreted from side-scan sonar imagery, observed in the underwater video \n\nobservations and confirmed by sampling, the MDAC occur within the mud volcanoes and \n\nmud cones, on the diapiric ridges, or associated with faults, as described in Chapter 4. \n\nThey occur as fields with a high density of carbonate samples. \n\n \nThe dolomite dominated MDAC (chimneys, crusts and nodules) show a large \n\nvariability of shapes and sizes, including pipe-like, curved or helicoidal shapes, conical, \n\nbranched, nodular, and massive irregular shapes. Their sizes are highly variable both in \n\nlength and diameter. Chimneys with more than 3 m long and up to 0.5 m in diameter were \n\nobserved. Most of these chimneys and crusts appear broken, sometimes intensely \n\nfragmented as carbonate rubble and occur most of the times lying on the sea floor. It is \n\nvery rare to find chimneys that are in the vertical position, protruding from the sediments.  \n\n \nAs concerns the aragonite dominated MDAC, they occur (1) as buildups and small \n\nmound-like buildups of variable dimensions, some up to 4-5 m high and several meters in \n\nlength; (2) as rough hard-grounds that can pave the seafloor for several square meters, with \n\na thin or absent sediment cover; (3) as crusts and slabs, similar to the pavements or; (4) as \n\nnodular centimetric masses within the superficial sediments. \n\n \n\nMDAC and their formation process \n\n \nAs discussed in Chapter 5, all the MDAC from the Gulf of Cadiz indicate that they \n\nformed as the result of anaerobic oxidation of fluids enriched in methane. This methane \n\ncan have two different and distinct origins: thermogenic or microbial origin. Under \n\nadequate pressure and temperature conditions this methane can be stored as hydrate layers \n\nor nodules within the sediments. When pressure or temperature changes these gas hydrates \n\ncan dissociate, leading to pore fluids enrichment in methane with light carbon, and water \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 341\n\nwith heavier oxygen isotopes. This methane from the dissociation of the gas hydrates, \n\ntogether with microbial and thermogenic methane that migrated from deeper parts of the \n\nsedimentary column, when it reaches the sulphate-methane transition zone, is anaerobically \n\noxidized (AOM) coupled with the reduction of sulphate (SR), through a process that is \n\nmediated by microbial activity by a consortium of archaea and sulphate reducing bacteria, \n\nas described by Boetius et al. (2000). As result of the AOM-SR net reaction the alkalinity \n\nin the pore fluids is increased, the sulphate is consumed and authigenic carbonate \n\n(aragonite, calcite, high-Mg calcite and dolomite) precipitation is induced. The \n\nprecipitation of the authigenic carbonate minerals results in the lithification of the \n\nsediments and this is the mechanism assumed for the formation of the MDAC. \n\n \nAlso as a result of the AOM-SR net reaction HS-, is produced an will precipitate as \n\npyrite or, together with methane which has not been completely precipitated, will feed \n\nchemosynthetic communities at the seafloor, such as Bathymodiolus and Calyptogena, that \n\nare frequently found cemented in the aragonite pavements. \n\n \nThe different morphologies and different carbonate types reflect different flow \n\npatterns through the sediments. This is summarized on the schematic model proposed for \n\nthe formation of the different MDAC shown in (Figure 5.17, Chapter 5). If the flux of fluid \n\nenriched in methane is canalized through the sulphate reducing zone (SRZ) of the \n\nsedimentary column, using borrows or sediment heterogeneities as pathways, a SMTZ with \n\na strong gradient will be developed around these fluid conduits and consequently \n\nprecipitation of the authigenic carbonates will be promoted around these conduits. Because \n\nthese fluid conduits correspond to confined environments in relation to seawater influence, \n\nsulphate depletion can be reached and dolomite will be the dominant mineralogy to \n\nprecipitate. The lithification of the sediments will result in the formation of the dolomite \n\nnodules, crusts and chimneys. The locations where the dolomite chimneys occur are \n\npresently swept by the flow of the Mediterranean undercurrent which can remobilize the \n\nunconsolidated sediments inside of which the chimneys were formed and therefore \n\nproduce the collapse of the individual chimneys, explaining their present position on the \n\nseafloor. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 9.  Main Conclusions, Future work and Open questions \n\n 342 \n\nAragonite pavements represent precipitation of authigenic carbonates in a similar \n\nprocess to that of dolomite morphologies but, in an environment closer to the seafloor. The \n\naragonite pavements will be formed at the sediment-seawater interface or close to it, as a \n\nproduct of the AOM-SR coupling process that can result from an active and discrete \n\nventing or from a more diffuse and low intensity venting process. Because these processes \n\nare more ventilated by seawater where high alkalinity is coupled with high sulphate \n\nconcentrations, the mineralogy is dominated by aragonite. \n\n \nTherefore, the widespread occurrence of MDAC can be interpreted as a fossil record \n\nof extensive methane seepage in this particular area of the Gulf of Cadiz, spatially \n\nassociated with probable deep fault systems and with mud volcanoes and diapirs, that \n\nconstitute preferential pathways for the fluid migration. They constitute a probable \n\nimportant natural methane sequestration process. \n\n \n\nMDAC precipitation and estimated pore fluids composition \n\n \nConsidering (1) the present day seabottom water temperatures, (2) the extreme limits \n\nfor temperature variation during the glacial/interglacial cycles, (3) the oxygen isotopic \n\ncomposition of the Gulf of Cadiz bottom waters, both for the North Atlantic Deep Water \n\nand the Mediterranean Outflow water, and (4) assuming that the oxygen isotopic ratio \n\nvariations are the typical between glacial and interglacial stages, the isotopic composition \n\nof the original fluids from which the carbonates precipitated were estimated according to \n\nthe different mineral/temperature fractionation equations of precipitation. Considering the \n\nminimum and maximum temperature limits admitted to be possible to occur in the Gulf of \n\nCadiz, not all the measured carbonate isotopic values are compatible with precipitation \n\nfrom normal seawater isotopic composition (as summarized in Figure 6.27, Chapter 6). \n\n \nAragonite pavements are estimated to have bee formed from normal seawater oxygen \n\nisotopic compositions, or from 18O-enriched pore waters, indicating a contribution from the \n\ndissociation of gas hydrates. \n\n \nSome dolomite chimneys indicate formation conditions from pore waters with \n\noxygen isotopic compositions similar to normal seawater. However, others indicate a \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 343\n\nformation from pore fluids with a contribution from destabilization of gas hydrates, or the \n\nprecipitation from pore waters during gas hydrates formation (Figure 6.27, Chapter 6). \n\n \n\nThe 87Sr/86Sr ratios of the authigenic carbonates do not indicate a clear and major \n\naddition of Sr from deep seated fluids, but they preferably reflect the contemporaneous \n\nseawater Sr composition. \n\n \n\nDating of the dolomite chimneys formation \n\n \nThe U/Th estimated ages of two dolomite chimneys, as described in Chapter 7, \n\nindicate that the precipitation of the authigenic carbonates occurs in short discontinuous \n\nintervals of time, most probably, intercalated with longer periods of absence of \n\nprecipitation. The chimneys that result from the precipitation during different episodes will \n\nexhibit different grow layers or concentric rings. \n\n \nThe estimated ages along radial profiles on dolomite chimneys indicate formation at \n\nperiods of rapid paleoceanographic changes. The ages obtained point to the precipitation \n\nduring: (1) the onsets of glacial/interglacial cycles (termination 2 and 3), contemporary \n\nwith rapid sealevel rises; (2) at the transition from stadial to interstadial, also \n\ncorresponding to rapid sealevel rise; and (3) at the transition from interglacial (MIS 5.5) to \n\nstadial MIS 5.4 or from interglacial (MIS 5.3) to stadial 5.2, associated with periods of \n\nprogressive sealevel lowering (Figure 7.12, Chapter 7). \n\n \nIt is proposed that the MDAC are the record of intense fluid flow episodes during \n\nperiods of increased seabottom water temperature, most probably as a result of the increase \n\nof the Mediterranean Outflow influence at the locations where the samples were collected \n\nfrom. This increase in seabottom water temperature is, most probably, reducing the gas \n\nhydrate stability zone, leading to gas hydrate dissociation and the consequent release of \n\nmethane-rich fluids which will induce the carbonate precipitation along the fluid conduits \n\non the fluid pathways above the methane seepage sites. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 9.  Main Conclusions, Future work and Open questions \n\n 344 \n\nMicrobial mediation on the formation of the MDAC \n\n \nAs discussed in Chapter 8, the presence of clotted microfabric in both aragonite and \n\ndolomite dominated carbonate cements is interpreted as indicating a microbial mediation in \n\nthe formation of the authigenic carbonates, particularly in the initiation of the carbonate \n\nprecipitation. This interpretation is also supported by other observable structures such as: \n\n(1) microbial filaments; (2) high Mg-calcite and dolomite crystal aggregates calcifying \n\nfilaments, some of them being incorporated by dolomite and calcite crystals; (3) rods with \n\nbrush-like terminations; (4) aragonite batons, ball-capped batons and nanograins; (5) \n\nmicrobial and mucous biofilms forming coatings, draped between the aragonite fibres and \n\nneedles of the stromatolitic layers; and (6) microbial filaments probably representing \n\nmorphological bacteria remains. \n\n \nSpecific 13C-depleted lipid biomarkers were identified in the dolomite chimney \n\nsamples. These include tail-to-tail linked acyclic isoprenoids such as PMI (2,6,10,15,19-\n\npentamethyleicosane) and squalane (2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyltetracosane). These \n\ncompounds derive from archaea involved in the anaerobic oxidation of methane. The \n\naragonite crusts showed even better preserved biomarker patterns in comparison with the \n\ndolomite chimneys. Bacterial lipid biomarkers strongly depleted in 13C occur in \n\ncomparable concentrations to the archaea lipid biomarkers, and have been described as \n\nrelated to sulphate-reducing bacteria. \n\n \nThe results of the SEM observations and biomarker analysis show that microbes, a \n\nconsortia of Archaea/sulphate-reducing bacteria, had an active key role in the formation of \n\nthe authigenic carbonates. An organogenic model is proposed not only for the dolomite \n\nprecipitation but also for the formation of the remaining authigenic carbonates (aragonite, \n\ncalcite and Mg-calcite). The microbial activity most probably created optimal micro-\n\nenvironmental geochemical conditions around the microbial structures, from where the \n\nprecipitation of the MDAC is initiated. \n\n \nThe presence of the stromatolitic and botryoidal fabrics further support the \n\nindications that the formation and dissociation of gas hydrates were processes actively \n\ninvolved in the precipitation of the authigenic carbonates. \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 345\n\n9.2 Future work and open questions \n\n \n\nNatural gas hydrates (GH) were recovered and inferred to occur in several mud \n\nvolcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz. The proximity of this methane reservoir to the seafloor and \n\nits restricted thermodynamic stability domain has motivated large speculations about the \n\nrelease of methane from destabilized GH in response to climatic changes (MacDonald, \n\n1990). Increases of seabottom temperature (as result of regional oceanographic condition \n\nchanges) and decreases in pressure (e.g. through sea level changes) can destabilize gas \n\nhydrates, releasing methane into the near-surface environment and having an important \n\nimpact on the carbon cycle (Buffett and Archer, 2004; Archer and Buffett, 2005). \n\nAccording to the clathrate gun hypothesis (Kennett et al., 2003), episodic atmospheric \n\nmethane emissions resulting from the destabilisation of GH reservoirs contributed \n\nsignificantly to the distinctive behaviour of late Quaternary climate. \n\nThe influence of GH destabilization on the carbon cycle depends on the volume of \n\nthe GH reservoirs and on how the GH responds to changes in the oceanographic conditions \n\n(time scale of the methane release). If GH destabilization and fluid escape is slow, then the \n\ndiffuse escape of methane will most probably result in its total oxidation in the sulphate-\n\nmethane transition zone, leading to the precipitation of methane-derived authigenic \n\ncarbonates (MDAC), or to its aerobic consumption by microbes, with negligible amounts \n\nbeing released to the seawater. If the fluid escape is fast enough, it will allow methane to \n\nbe released directly to the water column and possibly also to the atmosphere. The principal \n\nmechanisms of rapid methane release are 1) mud volcano (MV) activity (e.g. Etiope et al., \n\n2004; Etiope and Milkov, 2004); 2) slumping at continental slopes (Mienert et al., 1998); \n\nand 3) pervasive flow along fractures due to overpressured gas (Flemings et al., 2003). \n\nDuring the period of this research the several cruises and projects carried out in the \n\nGulf of Cadiz (GC) allowed the discovery of 42 MVs (Pinheiro et al., 2003; 2005). Gas \n\nhydrates were retrieved from some of them (Bonjardim, Captain Arutyunov and Ginsburg \n\nMVs) and inferred to occur in several others. Other fluid escape structures associated with \n\nthe MVs, such as pockmarks and MDAC (Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2004) indicate active processes \n\nof dewatering of the sedimentary basin. According to the carbon isotopic composition of \n\nthe GH, the presence of heavy hydrocarbons (Mazurenko et al., 2002; Nuzzo et al., 2005) \n\nand the isotopic composition of the authigenic carbonates (as concluded from the work \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter 9.  Main Conclusions, Future work and Open questions \n\n 346 \n\ncarried out from this thesis), the most active sites in the GC are characterized by high \n\nconcentrations of light hydrocarbons, both of microbial and thermogenic origin. The \n\nimplications of the identification of thermogenic light hydrocarbons in deeper parts of the \n\nsediment column and the evaluation of he potential source rocks are open questions to be \n\ninvestigated. \n\nThe Mediterranean Outflow water (MO) strongly influences the hydrology of the \n\nNorth Atlantic making the GC a highly sensitive region to paleoclimatic changes. The MV \n\nareas, in the upper and middle slope of the GC, are located under the influence of the MO. \n\nPossible influences of the MO on slope failure and GH destabilization have been proposed \n\nby Gardner (2001) and also from the results of the work carried out during this thesis. \n\nIt is now possible and evident that it would be of great importance to complete the \n\ninventory of GH occurrences in the GC and to model the GH stability field for the different \n\nranges of gas compositions determined from MV pore waters and the known GH \n\ncompositions. The spatial distribution of potential areas of GH occurrence and shallow gas \n\naccumulations need to be interpolated on a regional scale, with an estimation of potential \n\nvolumes involved and the response of the potential regional reservoirs to environmental \n\nchanges. \n\nSpecific structures such as the MV, mud cones, MDAC fields, pockmarks, landslides \n\nand erosive structures like some channels of the MO, should now be studied in detail. \n\nModelling different scenarios, with extreme oceanographic conditions (glacial and \n\ninterglacial maximums and variations in seabottom temperature, salinity, and oxygen \n\ncontent resulting from different MO strength and pathways) and their consequences on the \n\nGH stability field can now be investigated and understood. The determination of the \n\nresponses of the different fluid escape structures to episodes of GH destabilization is also \n\nan important task that should be investigated. \n\nA calculation of the GH stability domains should allow a reinterpretation of the \n\navailable seismic data in order to identify the existence of possible bottom simulating \n\nreflectors (BSRs) in areas where they have not been recognized previously. \n\nThe implications of the presence of methane on the benthic faunal communities and \n\non the geochemical characteristics of the sediments is also an important question to be \n\ninvestigated. With this objective, benthic foraminifera communities, from selected MVs \n\nwhere active fluid venting was recognised from this work, should be studied in order to \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n \n\n 347\n\nevaluate the isotopic composition of the benthic fauna and to establish criteria (isotopic \n\nand specific chemical fingerprints) that can be used to recognize fossil gas seeps on the \n\ngeological record. This is also an open question that can be a test of the clathrate gun \n\nhypothesis, as the quantification of the ?13C excursion towards depleted values in the \n\nforaminifera tests from seep sites with moderate to slow flux rates where all the methane is \n\nconsumed within the sediment, is pertinent. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 348 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n 349\n\n \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\n \nAcosta, J., Uchupi, E., A.Munoz, Herranz, P., Palomo, C., Ballesteros, M. and ZEEWorking Group \n\n2003.

Introduction\n\nA considerable quantity of work on the topics\nof mud volcanism, submarine gas hydrates, cold\nseeps and hydrocarbon-rich \u00a3uid venting has been\ndone over more than two decades, both by indus-\ntry and academia (see, for example, references in\nGinsburg and Soloviev, 1998, and in Milkov,\n2000). A particular e\u00a1ort has been put into under-\nstanding the role of tectonics in the occurrence of\nmud volcanism, particularly in compressional re-\ngimes (e.g. Westbrook and Smith, 1983; Barber et\nal., 1986; Limonov et al., 1996; Galindo-Zaldivar\net al., 1996; Woodside et al., 1997; COifcOi et al.,\n1997; Suess et al., 1999). Also, in the last few\nyears, the international scienti\u00a2c community has\ndevoted much attention to the widespread occur-\nrence of gas hydrates (mainly methane, which is a\ngreenhouse gas) in the ocean sub-bottom sedi-\nments and their importance to global carbon\n\u00a3uxes, climate change, slope instabilities and as\na potential energy resource for the future (e.g.\nHovland and Judd, 1988; Mienert et al., 1996;\nDickens et al., 1997; Judd et al., 1997; Nisbet\nand Piper, 1998; Ginsburg and Soloviev, 1998;\nHenriet and Mienert, 1998; Baraza et al., 1999;\nMilkov, 2000; Paull and Dillon, 2001).\nThe occurrence of mud volcanism, cold seep-\n\nage, hydrocarbon venting and gas hydrates in\nthe Gulf of Cadiz has been intensively investi-\ngated since 1996 (Baraza and Ercilla, 1996; Ba-\nraza et al., 1999; Gardner, 2001; Kenyon et al.,\n2000; Ivanov et al., 2000, 2001; Somoza et al.,\n2000; Mazurenko et al., 2001). Within the frame-\nwork of the UNESCO/IOC Training Through\nResearch Program, two research cruises have in-\nvestigated the Gulf of Cadiz for this speci\u00a2c pur-\npose: TTR-9, in 1999, and TTR-10, in 2000. Dur-\n\ning the TTR-9 cruise (Gardner, 2001; Kenyon et\nal., 2000), a large mud volcano \u00a2eld was discov-\nered in the Moroccan and Spanish margins of the\nGulf of Cadiz. This discovery was based on the\ninterpretation of a side-scan sonar mosaic and\nmultibeam bathymetry (SEAMAP) acquired in\nthat area by the Marine Physics Branch of the\nNaval Research Laboratory (NRL), Washington,\nDC, USA, in cooperation with the Hawaii Map-\nping Group and the Naval Oceanographic O?ce,\nin 1992. This was followed by three other cruises:\n(1) two cruises in the Spanish and Portuguese\nsectors of the Gulf of Cadiz, within the frame-\nwork of the Spanish Tasyo project, where, besides\nnew mud volcanoes, carbonate chimney structures\nrelated to \u00a3uid venting were recovered (Somoza et\nal., 2000, 2003); (2) the TTR-10 cruise (Leg 2).\nIn this paper we present the results of the TTR-\n\n10, Leg 2. The main objective of this cruise was to\ninvestigate several sea\u00a3oor structures observed on\nthe NRL side-scan mosaic, that occur in the\nSouth Portuguese, the Western Moroccan and\nthe Spanish margins of the Gulf of Cadiz. These\noften exhibit a signi\u00a2cant morphological expres-\nsion on the multibeam bathymetry and were in-\nterpreted as mud volcanoes. They were investi-\ngated with seismic pro\u00a2ling, long-range side-scan\nsonar (OKEAN), hull-mounted 3.5-kHz pro\u00a2ler,\nTV grab and were con\u00a2rmed by coring to be mud\nvolcanoes (Fig. 1). This work complements the\nprevious work done in the Moroccan and Spanish\nmargins during the TTR-9 cruise.\n\n2. Geological setting\n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz has had a very complex geo-\nlogical history and has undergone several episodes\n\nMARGO 3269 25-2-03\n\nL.M. Pinheiro et al. /Marine Geology 195 (2003) 131^151132\n\n\n\nof rifting, compression and strike-slip motion,\nsince the Triassic (Wilson et al., 1989; Dewey et\nal., 1989; Maldonado et al., 1999). During the\nMesozoic and the Early Cenozoic, the area was\nundergoing rifting, with the formation of half-gra-\nben structures and carbonate platforms (Maldo-\nnado et al., 1999). The westward migration of the\nGibraltar arc during the Late Tortonian caused\nthe Gulf of Cadiz to form as a forearc basin\nand induced the emplacement of an olistostrome,\nin an accretionary wedge-type depositional envi-\nronment, strongly deforming the sediments de-\nrived from the South Iberian and North African\nmargins of Thetys (Maldonado and Comas, 1992;\nMaldonado et al., 1999) (Fig. 2). The end of the\nemplacement of the olistostrome took place in the\nLate Miocene and coincided with an accelerated\ntectonic subsidence and the development of thick\n\nprogradational and aggradational depositional se-\nquences.\nThroughout this area, extensive mud volcanism\n\n(Fig. 2), mud diapirism, carbonate mounds and\nchimney structures related to hydrocarbon-rich\n\u00a3uid venting are observed (Somoza et al., 2003).\nThe observed mud volcanism has been interpreted\nas indicating the existence at depth of gas-rich\noverpressured sediments (Somoza et al., 2000).\nThe migration of these \u00a3uids through the sedi-\nments to the sea\u00a3oor appears, in some places, to\nhave been controlled by faulting, since some of\nthe mud volcanoes are located along major\nNW^SE and NE^SW trending faults identi\u00a2able\non the NRL side-scan imagery (Gardner, 2001).\nThe migration of the \u00a3uids along these faults is\npossibly related both to along-slope gravitational\nsliding and to the tectonic compression of the\n\nN\n\nFig. 1.

It has also been sug-\ngested that some of the widespread shallow \u00a3uid\nventing on the sea\u00a3oor, particularly in the North-\nern Gulf of Cadiz, could be explained by the de-\nstabilization of gas hydrate-rich sediments in con-\ntact with the Mediterranean Out\u00a3ow Water\n(MOW) (Somoza et al., 2000).\n\n3. Geophysical data acquisition\n\nDuring the TTR-10 cruise, additional geophys-\nical surveys with airgun single-channel seismic,\nOKEAN side-scan sonar and 3.5-kHz pro\u00a2ler\n\nwere carried out in the areas chosen for bottom\nsampling (Fig. 1).\n\n3.1. Seismic re\u00a3ection pro\u00a2les\n\nSingle-channel seismic re\u00a3ection pro\u00a2les were\nacquired in the Gulf of Cadiz area during the\nTTR-10 cruise. The source consisted of one 3.5-l\nairgun, at a pressure of 120 bar (12 MPa), towed\nat a depth of approximately 2^2.5 m and \u00a2red\nevery 10 s (i.e. approximately every 30 m). The\nstreamer consisted of one active section, 7.5 m\nlong, with 16 hydrophones, towed at a depth of\napproximately 2.5^3 m. The o\u00a1set between the\nseismic source and the middle of the hydrophone\narray was 180 m. The signals were analogue-\u00a2l-\n\nN\n\nFig. 2. Geological setting of the study area.

The data were acquired digitally using\nsoftware developed by Moscow State University\n(MSU). Preliminary processing was done on\nboard with RadExPro software, provided to the\nUnesco MSU Centre for Marine Geosciences by\nGSD Productions, Moscow, Russia. The basic\nprocessing sequence, after the de\u00a2nition of the\nsource-receiver geometry, consisted of the appli-\ncation of static shift corrections, amplitude recov-\nery by spherical divergence correction, and But-\nterworth bandpass \u00a2ltering (20^230 Hz).\n\n3.2. OKEAN side-scan coverage\n\nDue to time constraints and also to the fact\nthat the NRL mosaic provided excellent detail\nin the western part of the survey, where the geol-\nogy appears to be simpler, only the eastern part of\nthe study area (Lines PSAT 152^156) was sur-\nveyed with the long-range 10-kHz OKEAN side-\nscan sonar available on the Professor Logachev\n(Fig. 1). In this area, the geology is very complex\n\nwith a strong mix of tectonic and sedimentary\nfeatures. This survey was necessary to provide a\nmore detailed image of the sites selected for cor-\ning. It covers the Tasyo mud volcano and part of\nthe Tasyo \u00a2eld in the north.\n\n4. Bottom sampling results\n\nA total of 21 sites in the South Portuguese, the\nWestern Moroccan and the Spanish margins of\nthe Gulf of Cadiz were chosen for sampling (see\nlocation in Table 1). The precise sampling loca-\ntion was based on the interpretation of the NRL\nmosaic, complemented by additional seismic, 3.5-\nkHz pro\u00a2ler and OKEAN side-scan imagery.\nTwenty gravity cores were taken, with a total re-\ncovery of 36.87 m. One site was investigated with\na TV-controlled grab system (Student mud volca-\nno). The location of the 13 most important cores\nis depicted in Fig. 1. Macrofauna was recovered\nfrom the top 30 cm of each gravity core and from\nsieved sediments of the grab sample.

The Bonjardim mud volcano\nThis was the \u00a2rst structure, presumed to be a\n\nmud volcano, investigated during the TTR-10\ncruise. It is located at 35\u202127.6PN and 09\u202100.0PW.\nOn the NRL side-scan mosaic, it appears as an\napproximately circular, isolated feature, with a\ndiameter of ca. 1 km and a strong backscatter\n(Fig. 3a). The single-channel seismic pro\u00a2les\nPSAT-146 and PSAT-147 reveal that it has a\nheight of approximately 100 m (Fig. 3b) with a\nsea\u00a3oor depression at the rim of the cone. Four\ncores were taken on this structure, all of which\nrecovered mud breccia and con\u00a2rmed it to be a\nmud volcano.\nThe \u00a2rst core, AT-226G, was taken from the\n\ntop of the Bonjardim mud volcano, at a depth\nof 3059 m (Fig. 3b). The recovery consisted of\n151 cm of mud breccia matrix, supporting angular\nand subangular clasts of variable size (from milli-\nmetric to 3 cm) and lithology, mainly represented\nby brownish gray mudstone. There was no pelagic\nveneer, and only the uppermost few cm of the\nmud volcanic deposits were oxidized, suggesting\nthat this mud volcano was recently active. Di\u00a1er-\nent layers of mud breccia were observed along the\ncore, alternating lighter and water saturated with\ndarker and more consolidated mud breccia. This\nmay indicate di\u00a1erent \u00a3ows and stages of activity\nof the volcano. A strong H2S smell was detected\nand Pogonophora (two undetermined species)\nwere recovered from this core.\nThe second core, AT-227G (234 cm), was taken\n\nfrom a terrace just below the top of the mud\nvolcano, at a depth of 3066 m (Figs. 1 and 3);\nthe mud breccia recovered was very similar to the\none previously sampled (although it was more\nhomogenous) but the top 42 cm comprised a\nmarly sediment, soupy in the \u00a2rst 6 cm and then\nbioturbated and rich in Foraminifera. A strong\nH2S smell was present and a Pogonophora-rich\n\nTable 2\nTaxonomical list of the macrofauna collected during TTR-10\nin the mud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz\n\nTaxa Sampling stations\n\nPorifera\nundetermined species S (239-GR)\nCnidaria\nHydrozoa S (232-G, 239-GR);\n\nR (235-G)\nAnthozoa S (233-G, 239-GR)\nSipuncula\nundetermined species T (242-G); S (239-GR)\nAnnelida\nPolychaeta\nNothria hispanica (241-G)\nMaldanidae B (246-G)\nundetermined species S (233-G; 239-GR)\n\nPogonophora\nOligobrachia sp.

Foraminifera and empty polychaete tubes\nwere also recovered from this core.\nA third core, AT-228G (283 cm), was taken\n\nfrom the \u00a3ank of the mud volcano, at a depth\nof 3150 m, in order to de\u00a2ne the extension of\nthe mud \u00a3ows (Fig. 3). The recovery consisted\nof a thick intercalation of olive brown pelagic\nmarl and brown marly turbidites enriched in Fo-\nraminifera, easily distinguishable due to the sharp\nboundaries and the coarser texture. Bioturbation\nactivity was very strong throughout the whole\ncore. No mud breccia was recovered. One crusta-\ncean (Tanaidacea) and empty Pogonophora tubes\nwere recovered from this core.\nFinally, one last core, AT-246G (306 cm), was\n\ntaken, at a depth of 3060 m, on the top of the\nBonjardim mud volcano, in an attempt to recover\ngas hydrates. The recovery was comparable to\nthat of the station AT-226G, with a 12-cm layer\nof soupy and oxidized structureless mud breccia\nat the top, with angular and subangular clasts of\ndi\u00a1erent size and lithology. The contact between\nthe oxidized and the unoxidized parts was very\nsharp. Between 135 and 156 cm, an interval of\ndarker mud breccia was observed. Gas hydrates,\nin the form of small crystals, were \u00a2nally sampled\nand found below 156 cm. A strong H2S smell was\nevident and some small pyrite crystals were ob-\nserved. Foraminifera, Pogonophora (Oligobrachia\nsp.) and polychaete fragments (Maldanidae) were\nrecovered from this core.\n\n4.1.2. The Carlos Ribeiro mud volcano\nThe next mud volcano in the South Portuguese\n\nmargin that was investigated during the TTR-10\ncruise was named Carlos Ribeiro, after a famous\nPortuguese geologist (1813^1882). It is located\nat 35\u202147.217PN and 08\u202125.313PW, at a depth of\n2200 m. It is expressed as a high re\u00a3ectivity sub-\ncircular spot on the NRL SEAMAP mosaic (Fig.\n4a). The 3.5-kHz pro\u00a2ler con\u00a2rms its conical\nshape, with a height of approximately 80 m and\na diameter of ca. 1.5 km (Fig. 4b).\nTwo cores, separated by approximately 30 m,\n\nwere taken from the top of this structure: AT-\n243G and AT-244G (Fig. 4; Table 1). The cores\n\nare similar, showing almost no pelagic sediments\non top, and a succession of gray structureless very\npoorly sorted mud breccia, slightly oxidized and\nbioturbated at the very top (only a few cm thick\non core AT-244G); this indicates that this is a\nrecently active structure. The mud breccia recov-\nered is highly gasi\u00a2ed, with an intense H2S smell.\nThe clasts are subangular or angular rock frag-\nments of di\u00a1erent lithologies and shapes, with\nvariable sizes sometimes reaching 15 cm. Among\nthem was found one fragment of semi-consoli-\ndated claystone with a thin bitumenous pellicule\nat the surface. The strong H2S smell throughout\nboth cores and the lack of a pelagic veneer at the\ntop of both successions con\u00a2rms an intense recent\nactivity of this mud volcano. Some empty shells\nand one live bivalve (Thyasiridae), Foraminifera,\nempty Thecosomata shells and Pogonophora (Oli-\ngobrachia sp. and another undetermined species)\nwere recovered from this site.\n\n4.1.3. The Olenin mud volcano\nThe next structure to be investigated was the\n\nOlenin mud volcano (Figs. 1 and 5), named after\na famous Russian scientist (1923^1982). On the\nSEAMAP mosaic, it appears as a dome-like struc-\nture with high re\u00a3ectivity, located at approxi-\nmately 35\u202145PN and 08\u202126PW, on a slope. It was\nsurveyed with a 3.5-kHz pro\u00a2ler. Two crossing\npro\u00a2les were collected, and one core, AT-245G,\nwas taken near the summit of this structure (Fig.\n5). The 287 cm of core recovered is mainly repre-\nsented by pelagic yellowish brown and olive gray\nmarl with olive brown and gray clay. The sedi-\nments were bioturbated and contained a silty and\nforaminiferal admixture. Several oxidized layers\nwere observed throughout the core and traces of\na reduction front were described for the lower-\nmost part of the succession, suggesting possible\npast \u00a3uid venting in the site. A minor part of\nthe core consisted of two thin layers of mud vol-\ncanic deposits: one at the 60^65-cm and the other\nat the 210^210-cm intervals. They both were char-\nacterized by sharp irregular contacts and con-\ntained millimetric to centimetric subangular clasts\nof di\u00a1erent lithologies in a silty clayey matrix. The\nfauna recovered from this site included Forami-\nnifera, empty Thecosomata shells and a few frag-\n\nMARGO 3269 25-2-03\n\nL.M.

Mud volcano?\nOne dome-shaped structure was also observed\n\non the OKEAN side-scan sonar records and on\nthe seismic pro\u00a2le PSAT-148, at approximately\n35\u202129PN, 08\u202115PW (Fig. 1). One core, AT-229G,\nwas taken in this structure. A hemipelagic succes-\nsion of alternating light olive brown and strongly\nbioturbated marl rich in Foraminifera and more\ngrayish, also intensively bioturbated marl was re-\ncovered. Although no mud breccia was recovered\nfrom this site, a mud volcanic origin of the dome-\nlike structure cannot be excluded. Empty tubes of\nPogonophora and Polychaeta were also retrieved\nfrom this site.\n\n4.2. The Spanish \u00a2eld\n\nIn the Spanish \u00a2eld, several occurrences of gas\nseepage and mud volcanism were discovered dur-\ning the TTR-9 (Kenyon et al., 2000) and TTR-10\ncruises. In the northern part of this sector, a sig-\nni\u00a2cant amount of very high quality data, includ-\ning multibeam bathymetry, high resolution seis-\nmics, coring and dredging, was collected in the\nTasyo \u00a2eld (Somoza et al., 1999, 2003). During\nthe TTR-9 cruise, a very interesting mud volcano\nwas discovered in this area ^ the St. Petersburg\nmud volcano (Gardner, 2001; Kenyon et al.,\n2000). During the TTR-10 cruise, another dome-\nlike structure, discovered during the Spanish Geo-\nlogical Institute expedition in 1999 (L. Somoza,\npersonal communication) was investigated: the\nTasyo mud volcano.\n\n4.2.1. The Tasyo mud volcano\nThe Tasyo mud volcano is located approxi-\n\nmately at 35\u202145PN and 07\u202105PW. During the\nTTR-10 cruise, both OKEAN and seismics were\nused to investigate this structure prior to coring.\nThe seismic Line PSAT-152 crossed the TASYO\nmud volcano (Figs. 1 and 6).\nTwo cores were taken on the top of this mud\n\nvolcano (Table 1). The \u00a2rst core, AT-241G (Fig.\n6), at a depth of 1100 m, penetrated carbonate-\nrich super\u00a2cial sediments (marls with dead corals\n\n^ Lophelia), overlying a mud breccia with gas\nvesicles. Empty shells of Thecosomata and other\ngastropods, Sipuncula (undetermined species) and\nPolychaeta (Nothria hispanica), were recovered\nfrom this site. The second core, AT-242G, at a\nwater depth of 1100 m, penetrated marls and\nmud breccia like AT-241G, with Foraminifera,\nalthough with less dead corals (Lophelia). The\ntwo cores recovered showed a marly unit on the\ntop, of di\u00a1ering thickness. In both cases the yel-\nlowish brown marl was found to be rich in Fora-\nminifera and contained a coral-supported layer at\nabout 15 cm below the top of the core. In the core\nAT-241G, coral fragments showed up again in the\nlower part of the marly unit between 50 and 69\ncm, where the sediment appeared to be more\ngrayish and enriched in Foraminifera. The second\nhalf of these cores was a homogenous and struc-\ntureless mud breccia with a large number of clasts\nof di\u00a1erent roundness and size (in some cases up\nto 9 cm in size). Both cores showed evidence of a\npossible development of coral build-ups on hard\nsubstrate, namely carbonate crusts at the surface\nof the mud volcanic edi\u00a2ce.\n\n4.3. The Western Moroccan \u00a2eld\n\nIn the Western Moroccan \u00a2eld, where the\nYuma, Ginsburg, Kidd, Adamastor and TTR\nmud volcanoes were discovered during the TTR-\n9 cruise (Gardner, 2001; Kenyon et al., 2000), \u00a2ve\nsites were chosen for bottom sampling (see loca-\ntion in Fig. 1). Three new mud volcanoes were\ndiscovered: Jesus Baraza, Student and Rabat.\nThree cores were also taken from the previously\nknown Ginsburg mud volcano, and more gas hy-\ndrates were recovered from them.\n\n4.3.1. The Jesus Baraza mud volcano\nThis was the second structure to be cored dur-\n\ning the TTR-10 cruise. It also proved to be a mud\nvolcano and was named Jesus Baraza, after a re-\ncently deceased Spanish geologist who worked in-\ntensively on methane seeps. On the side-scan mo-\nsaic it shows up as a circular feature with a strong\nbackscatter (Fig. 7a). On the seismic pro\u00a2les (east-\nern end on Line PSAT-151; Fig. 1) it shows as a\nprominent high with a maximum height above\n\nMARGO 3269 25-2-03\n\nL.M.

Two cores were\ncollected in this mud volcano.\nThe \u00a2rst core, AT-230G, was taken from the\n\n\u00a3ank of the mud volcano, at the base of the slope,\nat a water depth of 1159 m. A hemipelagic marly\nsuccession was recovered with bioturbation and\nForaminifera distributed throughout the whole\ncore. The usual few centimeters of soupy and\nwater-saturated brownish marl were found at\nthe top, with the sediment becoming more consis-\ntent downcore. Slump structures were visible be-\nlow 120 cm, where darker layers and burrows\nwere tilted and bent in an oblique orientation.\nNo mud breccia was recovered. This indicates\nthat hemipelagic and slump deposition was prev-\nalent on this slope for a relatively long period.\nOnly a few specimens of Foraminifera and empty\nThecosomata shells were recovered from this core.\nThe second core, AT-231G, at a water depth of\n\n1091 m, sampled the top of the mud volcano. The\n\u00a2rst 4 cm consisted of light brown soupy and\nwater-saturated marl very rich in Foraminifera,\nwith a few Pogonophora (Siboglinum sp.). The\nrest of the core could be subdivided in two main\nunits. The \u00a2rst unit (4^27 cm) showed structure-\nless water-saturated brownish mud breccia with\nclayey matrix and numerous clasts of di\u00a1erent\ncolor, roundness and lithology. The oxidation of\nthis interval and the bioturbation with burrows,\n\u00a2lled with sediment from the upper marl layer,\nmight indicate that the mud volcano has not\nbeen active recently. The second unit (27^1254\ncm) presented the same mud breccia found above\nbut more consolidated and without oxidation or\nbioturbation. A strong H2S smell was detected.\nThe mud breccia unit was relatively well strati\u00a2ed,\nwith several intervals representing di\u00a1erent mud\n\u00a3ows. Mud breccia \u00a3ows therefore occurred on\nthis mud volcano but they did not reach the site\nof the \u00a2rst of these two cores.\n\n4.3.2. Student. Another mud volcano?\nTwo cores, AT-232G and AT-233G, and one\n\nTV-controlled grab station (AT-239GR) were tak-\nen on this high re\u00a3ectivity, sub-circular feature\nobserved on both the NRL mosaic and the\nOKEAN sonar mosaic obtained during the\nTTR-9 cruise (Fig. 8). They con\u00a2rmed that this\n\nstructure is related to cold seepage, and it was\nnamed Student. A carbonate crust and dead cor-\nals (Madrepora and Lophelia) were retrieved from\nthe top part of the cores.\nThe \u00a2rst core, AT-232G, showed a poor recov-\n\nery, with only some material in the core catcher.\nIt was represented by gray mud enriched in Fo-\nraminifera, with numerous dead coral branches of\nLophelia cf. pertusa and Madrepora cf. oculata\nand abundant fragments of mollusc shells and\nechinoderm spikes. Many Pogonophora (Sibogli-\nnum sp.), some hydroids, one decapod (Munidop-\nsis sp.) and one bivalve (Limopsis sp.), were also\nrecovered. Three carbonate crusts were collected.\nThe second core, AT-233G, recovered 36 cm of\n\nyellowish brown and grayish brown marl, very\nenriched in Foraminifera with fragments of bi-\nvalve shells and dead coral branches (Madrepora\nand Lophelia). One anthozoan, a polychaete frag-\nment and a juvenile pogonophoran (probably Si-\nboglinum sp.), were collected from this sample. A\ncarbonate crust (5 cm in size) was also found in\nthe middle of the recovered sequence.\nFinally, one grab station (AT-239GR), posi-\n\ntioned with a TV camera, recovered carbonate\ncrusts and marls. A video pro\u00a2le across this struc-\nture con\u00a2rmed the assumption about recent seep-\nage in the area, and showed the presence of gas-\nrelated carbonate build-ups, dense clam beds\n(probably Solemya mediterranea), living coral,\nand coral debris. A number of yellowish and\ngrayish brown porous carbonate crusts were col-\nlected, reaching 50 cm in size. The fauna recov-\nered from this sample was very abundant and\ndiversi\u00a2ed: 50 specimens belonging to 17 di\u00a1erent\ntaxa were collected. These included Porifera, Cni-\ndaria (Hydrozoa and Anthozoa), Sipuncula, Poly-\nchaeta, Pogonophora (Siboglinum sp.), Mollusca\n(undetermined gastropod, Cuspidariidae-like bi-\nvalves, Limopsis sp.), Pycnogonida (Hedgepethia\natlantica), Crustacea (Cirripedia, the cumacean\nProcampylaspis sp., the amphipod Liropus cf.\nelongatus, a tanaid and an anthurid isopod) and\nEchinodermata (undetermined species of Echini-\ndae and Ophiuridae).\n\n4.3.3.

One core, AT-235G, was taken\nfrom the top of this structure. 288.5 cm of sedi-\nment was recovered. The \u00a2rst 19 cm consisted of\nyellowish brown marl intensively bioturbated and\nwater-saturated for the \u00a2rst 6 cm. Foraminifera,\nPogonophora (Siboglinum sp.), shell^coral debris\nand dead coral (Lophelia) were found throughout\nthis interval. From 19 to 129 cm the core showed\nthe same marl but with a grayish color becoming\ndarker towards the bottom. Coral debris were\npresent throughout this interval. Bioturbation\nwas extremely intense, with large burrows \u00a2lled\nwith soupy, sandy silty clay, presumably from\nan underlying interval. The rest of the core was\nmud breccia, with a color varying from gray to\ndark gray; the intervals separated by sharp\nboundaries were interpreted as di\u00a1erent mud\n\u00a3ows. Surprisingly the mud breccia showed in-\ntense bioturbation; this, together with the exis-\ntence of a marly sediment upper cover, appears\nto indicate that the mud volcano has been inactive\nfor a relatively long period of time.\n\n4.3.4. The Ginsburg mud volcano\nThree cores were collected and gas hydrates re-\n\ntrieved from the top of the Ginsburg mud volcano\n(see location in Fig. 1), discovered during the\nTTR-9 cruise (Gardner, 2001; Kenyon et al.,\n2000): AT-236G, AT-237G and AT-238G. The\nrecovery varied from 145 to 182 cm and they all\nshowed the same lithology: a structureless, gray,\nvery gassi\u00a2ed mud breccia with a thin oxidized\ninterval at the very top. The target, to recover\ngas hydrate crystals, was successfully accom-\nplished in core AT-238G, from which ice-like\ngas hydrates up to 5 cm in size (Fig. 9) were\ncollected from the interval below 150 cm. These\nwere stored in a cold laboratory for later geo-\nchemical analyses. According to the data obtained\nduring the TTR-9 and TTR-10 cruises, the Gins-\nburg mud volcano appears to be presently the\nmost active mud volcano in the Gulf of Cadiz.\nForaminifera and Pogonophora (Siboglinum sp.)\nwere recovered from this site.\n\n4.3.5. Diapir-like structure. Mud volcano?\nOne core, AT-234G, was also taken from the\n\ntop of dome-shaped structure shown as a high\nre\u00a3ectivity spot on both the NRL mosaic and\nthe OKEAN side-scan data from the TTR-9\ncruise. 241 cm of a marly succession was recov-\n\nFig. 9.

All this evidence seems to indicate the\nexistence of \u00a3uid venting through the sea\u00a3oor.\nAlthough no more cores were taken from this\nstructure, its gas escape origin was con\u00a2rmed.\nThus, this site clearly deserves further investiga-\ntion.\n\n5. Micropaleontological investigation of the matrix\nfrom the mud volcanic deposits\n\nMicropaleontological studies were carried out\non board, to date the matrix of the mud volcanic\ndeposits using calcareous nannofossils. Samples\nfrom the matrix of the mud breccia were taken\nfrom the Bonjardim, Carlos Ribeiro, Jesus Bara-\nza, Rabat, Ginsburg and Tasyo mud volcanoes\nfor preliminary determination of the time range.\nSmear slides were prepared from raw samples and\nexamined under the microscope. The method of\ncalcareous nannofossils identi\u00a2cation of Perch-\nNielsen (Bolli et al., 1985) was applied to cocco-\nliths.\nCalcareous nannofossils from di\u00a1erent ages\n\nhave been found in the matrix of the mud brec-\ncias. Preservation of the calcareous nannofossils is\nmoderate to poor. They seem to be partially dis-\nsolved, which makes it di?cult to identify small\nforms. Relatively large coccoliths show good pres-\nervation. In general, discoasters are found to be\ndamaged and at times their arms broken, making\ntheir identi\u00a2cation di?cult. Some representatives\nof the discoasters show overcalci\u00a2cation patterns\nthat obscure important features and cause com-\nplications during the process of identi\u00a2cation and\nclassi\u00a2cation of species.\nSome Upper Cretaceous species are common in\n\nthe samples from the mud volcanoes. In each\nsample, four to six species of Upper Cretaceous\ncoccoliths were identi\u00a2ed in the mud volcanoes of\nthe Moroccan and the Spanish margins. The most\nabundant species are Micula decussata and Watz-\n\nnaueria barnesae. These species could have been\nderived from a hemipelagic source or from slope\nsediment by the process of re-sedimentation. They\nare also present in the pelagic sediments observed\non the super\u00a2cial sediments of some mud volca-\nnoes. Thus, the presence of these species is not\nconclusive evidence of an Upper Cretaceous age.\nOnly the mud volcanoes discovered in the South\nPortuguese margin show an assemblage of Upper\nCretaceous coccoliths. It is possible that Upper\nCretaceous deposits are located near the roots of\nthe mud volcanoes on the Portuguese margin.\nPaleocene species occur only sporadically in\n\nonly two sediment samples. The most probable\nexplanation for this is the absence of signi\u00a2cant\nPaleocene deposits near the roots of the studied\nmud volcanoes. Calcareous nannofossils, typical\nof Eocene deposits, are found in abundance.\nAmong them Reticulofenestra umbilica, R. hillae,\nDiscoaster barbendiensis, D. saipanensis, Ericsonia\nformosa are frequently observed in smear slides.\nBased on these nannofossils it is con\u00a2rmed that\nthere are Eocene deposits in the roots of the mud\nvolcanoes. There are also some transitional spe-\ncies through the Oligocene (D. de\u00a3andrei, Cycli-\ncargolithus \u00a3oridanus, C. abisectus, Dictycoccites\nbisectus). However, the presence of the Oligocene\nsediments cannot be con\u00a2rmed because of lack of\nevidence of marker species. The most abundant\nspecies in the matrix are Miocene^Pliocene cocco-\nliths and discoasters. There are numerous species\nin all the samples of the matrix that were studied.\nThe following species were observed most fre-\nquently in the smear slides: Discoaster variabilis,\nD. druggii, D. pansus, Reticulofenestra pseudoum-\nbilica, R. gelida, Reticulofenestra spp., Dictycoc-\ncites spp., Sphenolithus heteromorphus, Calcidiscus\nmacintyrei; several other species were also\npresent. The presence of Miocene^Pliocene species\nsuggests that sediments of these ages have been\nactively involved in the process of mud volcanism\nin the region.\nQuantitative analysis of the coccoliths was car-\n\nried out in the samples of matrix from mud brec-\ncia in core AT-227G. Amongst the 145 specimens\nof calcareous nannofossils, 45 are from the Upper\nCretaceous (mainly Micula decussata 26, Watz-\nnaueria barnesae 15, Cribrospherella ehrinbergii\n\nMARGO 3269 25-2-03\n\nL.M. Pinheiro et al. /Marine Geology 195 (2003) 131^151 147\n\n\n\n5, etc.), 25 specimens are from the Eocene (Eric-\nsonia formosa 7, Reticulofenestra umbilica 5,\nR. hillae 3), 15 specimens are transitional from\nthe Upper Eocene through the Oligocene to the\nlower Miocene, and 37 specimens are from the\nMiocene^Pliocene (mainly di\u00a1erent types of Dis-\ncoasters, small Reticulofenestra, R. pseudoumbili-\nca, R. gelida and Dictycoccithes sp.). The other\nspecies are recent coccoliths namely Emiliania\nhuxley, Gephyrocapsa sp., Coccolithus pelagicus,\nCalcidiscus leptoporus, Rhabdosphaera claviger\nand Syracosphaera pulchra.\n\n6. Discussion and conclusions\n\nFrom the combined results of the TTR-9, TTR-\n10 and Tasyo cruises, there is now vast evidence\nof extensive cold seepage, carbonate mound for-\nmation including cold-water coral communities\n(Lophelia skeletons), hydrocarbon-rich gas vent-\ning and mud diapirism in the South Portuguese,\nSpanish and Western Moroccan margins of the\nGulf of Cadiz (Baraza and Ercilla, 1996; Baraza\net al., 1999; Kenyon et al., 2000, 2001; Ivanov et\nal., 2000; Somoza et al., 2000, 2003; Gardner,\n2001; Mazurenko et al., 2001). This has been in-\nterpreted as indicating the existence of gas-rich\noverpressured sediments at depth and the migra-\ntion of these \u00a3uids through the sediments and/or\nalong major faults to the sea\u00a3oor (Somoza et al.,\n2000).\nAs regards the tectonic control of the location\n\nof the mud volcanoes, the NRL SEAMAP mosaic\nshows that some of these structures are aligned\nalong major fault structures, probably strike-slip,\nwith two main orientations: NW^SE and a con-\njugate NE^SW set (Gardner, 2001). Therefore,\nalthough some of the widespread shallow \u00a3uid\nventing on the sea\u00a3oor in the northern part of\nthe Gulf of Cadiz may be explained by the de-\nstabilization of gas hydrate-rich sediments in con-\ntact with the warmer MOW (Somoza et al., 2000),\na signi\u00a2cant number of the mud volcanoes in the\ndeeper areas of the basin appear to be controlled\nby major faults that acted as conduits for the\n\u00a3uids. The overpressure in the sediments at depth\nis possibly related to fast sediment supply, along-\n\nslope gravitational sliding and to the tectonic\ncompression of the olistostrome and accretionary\ncomplex caused by the Africa^Eurasia conver-\ngence (Somoza et al., 2000).\nThere is also strong evidence that the mud vol-\n\ncanoes located in the western and deeper parts of\nthe Gulf of Cadiz are the most active, with the\nexception of the Ginsburg mud volcano, on the\nMoroccan sector. Gas hydrates were recovered\nfrom both the Bonjardim and the Ginsburg mud\nvolcanoes. The signi\u00a2cance of this is not yet fully\nunderstood but is possibly related to the distribu-\ntion of the tectonic stress in this area.\nThe typical structures related to \u00a3uid venting in\n\nthis area are conical mud volcanoes with diame-\nters ranging from several tens of meters to ca.\n4 km and heights that can reach 200 m (Ivanov\net al., 2000). In some of the cores recovered from\nthese structures (e.g. Bonjardim mud volcano), a\nstrong H2S smell could be felt. This, together with\nthe lack of a pelagic veneer and abundant Pogo-\nnophora at the very top of the core, appears to\nindicate active venting. Evidence of multiple \u00a3ows\nwas also observed on several mud volcanoes.\nAs regards the age of the gas-rich layer, the\n\noldest clasts found in the cores are of Upper Cre-\ntaceous age (Bonjardim, Carlos Ribeiro and Ta-\nsyo), particularly in the Portuguese sector,\nalthough the majority of the clasts are of Eo-\ncene/Miocene age. Since the study area is an ac-\ncretionary complex with an olistostrome emplace-\nment, this does not necessarily imply that the\noverpressured gas-rich mud layer is older, because\nthe Upper Cretaceous clasts may belong to the\noverlying olistostrome and come from the eastern\nnappes. Further research is necessary to clarify\nthis problem.\nCarbonate crusts and cold-water coral com-\n\nmunities were found only in the eastern sectors\nof the Gulf of Cadiz, i.e. the Spanish and Moroc-\ncan sector. Seepage contributes to the enrichment\nof dissolved organic carbon in the water column\nwhich seemingly favors the development of such\ncommunities (Hovland et al., 1998). However, the\npresence of a hard substrate in some of the mud\nvolcanoes, namely the existence of carbonate\ncrusts or mud breccias, may be crucial to the ini-\ntial settlement of the coral larvae.

This\nwork followed the discovery of a large mud volcano field in the Gulf of Cadiz, first investigated during the TTR-9\ncruise [Gardner (2001) Geophys. Res. Lett. 28, 339^342; Kenyon et al. (2000) IOC, Technical series no. 56]. The\ndiscoveries were made based on a SEAMAP side-scan sonar mosaic and multibeam bathymetry (SEABEAM)\ncollected in the area by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), Washington, DC, USA, in 1992, kindly released for\nthis purpose. Single-channel seismics, long-range side-scan sonar (OKEAN), TV-controlled grab, hull-mounted 3.5-\nkHz profiler and coring were used to investigate several seafloor features observed on the side-scan sonar imagery, in\nthe South Iberia, Spanish and Moroccan margins of the Gulf of Cadiz, which were confirmed to be mud volcanoes.\nThe typical structures related to fluid venting in the Gulf of Cadiz are essentially represented by conical mud\nvolcanoes with diameters ranging from several tens of meters to 4 km and heights that can reach 200 m. Some of these\nstructures appear to be aligned along major conjugate NE^SW and NW^SE trending faults that can be identified on\nthe side-scan sonar imagery. The new field discovered in the South Portuguese margin is the deepest in the Gulf of\nCadiz area and includes three new mud volcanoes ^ Bonjardim, Olenin and Carlos Ribeiro ^ which seem to be quite\nactive, with near-surface gas hydrate occurrence and a high saturation in H2S and hydrocarbon gases (mainly\nmethane) in the mud breccia and overlying pelagic sediments. Gas hydrates were recovered from the Bonjardim mud\nvolcano. An intensely gassified mud breccia, with one fragment of semi-consolidated claystone with a thin bituminous\nveneer at the surface, was recovered from the Carlos Ribeiro mud volcano. The fauna recovered consists mainly of\npogonophoran worms belonging to several species and undetermined species of Foraminifera. Three new mud\nvolcanoes were also discovered in the NW Moroccan margin: Rabat, Student and Jesus Baraza. These show a richer\n\n0025-3227/02/$ ^ see front matter G 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The fauna col-\nlected in the Moroccan sector exhibited a high\ndiversity that can be explained mainly by the\nhigh habitat heterogeneity due to the availability\nof di\u00a1erent substrates (soft muddy sediments, car-\nbonated crust, dead coral beds).\nThe macrofauna collected in the Gulf of Cadiz\n\nincluded several species of pogonophoran worms\nbelonging to the genera Siboglinum, Polybrachia\nand Oligobrachia. Variations in the species distri-\nbution are mainly depth-related with a higher di-\nversity occurring at the deeper Portuguese mud\nvolcanoes. Thyasirid bivalves (one living specimen\nand several empty shells), whose complex burrow\nsystems oxygenate the sediments to a depth of\nmore than 8 cm, were also recovered in the Por-\ntuguese sector. Video footages from the Moroc-\ncan sector, collected during this cruise, showed\nevidence of dense clam beds (probably Solemya\nmediterranea). These pogonophoran and bivalve\nspecies are known to contain bacterial symbionts\nand form chemosynthetic communities that are\nsustained by \u00a3uid expulsion through mud volca-\nnoes (Southward, 1985, 1986; Southward et al.,\n1981; Sibuet and Olu, 1998).\nChemoautotrophic organisms may interact with\n\nthe sediment properties: high levels of bioturba-\ntion are associated with the dense beds of the\nbivalves that can cause signi\u00a2cant changes in the\nchemical characteristics of the sediment due to the\nactivity of their symbionts (Dando and South-\nward, 1986). On the other hand these organisms\nrespond to the environment characteristics and\nmay also be used as indicators of \u00a3uid emission:\nvariations in the density of Pogonophora (number\nof tubes per m2) can be related to the intensity or\nchemistry and regularity or persistence of \u00a3uid\nemissions in seepage areas (Sibuet and Olu,\n1998). No Pogonophora were recovered from\nthe Spanish \u00a2eld, while the highest densities\nwere found at the Student, Ginsburg (Moroccan\nsector) and Bonjardim (Portuguese sector) mud\nvolcanoes. This biological information agrees\nwith the geological evidence of recent activity es-\npecially in the two latter volcanoes.\nBased on all the available data, the main con-\n\nclusions that can be drawn from the bottom sam-\n\npling results, integrated with the geophysical\ndata and the preliminary work carried out, can\nbe summarized as follows:\n^ A large variety of sediment types present in\n\nthe Gulf of Cadiz area were recovered and de-\nscribed, implying a superposition of di\u00a1erent de-\npositional environments in this region of very\ncomplex geology and \u00a3uid \u00a3uxes.\n^ The mud volcanism is a widespread phenom-\n\nenon in the Gulf of Cadiz and six new mud vol-\ncanoes were discovered in the area during the\nTTR-10 cruise. Most of them were proven to be\nrecently active, in particular Bonjardim, Carlos\nRibeiro and Ginsburg. Gas hydrates were recov-\nered from Bonjardim and Ginsburg.\n^ The mud volcanism of the Gulf of Cadiz is\n\ncharacterized by a zonal pattern in terms of the\nmud breccia lithology typical of di\u00a1erent mud\nvolcanoes. In general, relatively thin mud breccia\n\u00a3ows, intensively bioturbated at the top, and\nsemi-consolidated clasts within matrix with high\ncarbonate content are characteristic of the mud\nvolcanoes sampled on the Spanish and Moroccan\nmargins of the Gulf of Cadiz. Non-strati\u00a2ed thick\nsti\u00a1 mud breccia, only occasionally bioturbated,\nand numerous well lithi\u00a2ed clasts within matrix\nlacking signi\u00a2cant carbonate admixture were\nfound to be typical of the mud volcanoes from\nthe Portuguese margin of the Gulf of Cadiz.\n^ The co-existence of coral-rich carbonate\n\nbuild-ups and mud volcanic activity was con-\n\u00a2rmed to be widely present in the Gulf of Cadiz.\nHowever, this co-existence appears to be re-\nstricted to the shallower Spanish and Moroccan\nsectors (900^1200 m) and apparently absent on\nthe deeper Portuguese sector (2200^3200 m).\n^ Faunal communities probably sustained by\n\nhydrocarbon-rich \u00a3uid emission through mud vol-\ncanoes were also widely present in the Gulf of\nCadiz.\n^ Di\u00a1erences in composition and structure of\n\nthe chemosynthetic-based communities in the\nmud volcanoes may be related to the intensity\nor chemistry, or to the regularity or persistence\nof the hydrocarbon-rich \u00a3uid emission. These dif-\nferences may be used as indicators of temporal\nvariations in the activity of the mud volcanoes.\n\nMARGO 3269 25-2-03\n\nL.M.

The cluster was discovered during a survey with the RV Belgica and studied\n\nfurther during Leg 2 of the TTR 12 survey onboard the R/V Prof Logachev. The 2002 surveys yielded detailed multibeam\n\nbathymetry over a 700 km\n2\nstudy area, dense grids of high-resolution seismic data, deep-tow sub bottom profiles, sidescan\n\nsonar mosaics over the major structures. Selected video imagery lines, video guided grab samples, dredge samples, gravity\n\ncores, and box cores were collected for groundtruthing purposes.

Introduction\n\nSince the first mud volcano was discovered in the\n\nGulf of Cadiz in 1999 (Gardner, 2000, 2001), 30 or\n\nmore mud volcanoes were identified in the span of\n\nthree years (Pinheiro et al., 2002; Somoza et al.,\n\n2003), together with vast fields of hydrocarbon-de-\n\nrived pockmarks and other features related to fluid\n\nescape (Barazza and Ercilla, 1996). As such, the Gulf\n\nof Cadiz (Fig. 1) has, in a very short time, become one\n\nof the prime targets to study these submarine features\n\nand the associated sedimentary, biological and bio-\n\nchemical processes.\nallochtonous nappes\n\naccretionary style deformation\n\nTriassic diapiric zone\n\n8o W9o W\n\n37o N\n\n36o N\n\n8o W9o W\n\nFaro\n\nshelf edge\n\nLolita\n\nBonjardim\nGin\n\nGDR field\n\nTASYO fieDPM field\n\nFig. 1.

The El Arraiche mud\n\nvolcano cluster (Fig. 2) consists of 8 mud volcanoes in\n\nwater depths from 200 to 700 m. The largest mud\n\nvolcano in the field (Al Idrissi mud volcano) is 255\n\nm high and 5.4 km wide and the smallest mud volca-\n\nnoes (Lazarillo de Tormes and Don Quichote mud\n\nvolcanoes) are only 500 m wide and 25 m high.

Integration\n\nof data sets allows studying these long-lived mud\n\nvolcanoes in detail, and moreover, macro as well as\n\nmicro level studies over selected places from the re-\n\ngional scales down to microscopic scales.\n\nMud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz are closely\n\nassociated with accretionary wedge-type setting re-\n\nlated to the convergence of the African and Eurasian\n\nplate boundaries and gravitational thin-skinned tec-\n\ntonics over a Triassic salt decollement, also com-\n\nmonly known as the olistostrome unit (Somoza et\n\nal., 2003). The newly discovered El Arraiche field is\n\npart of a larger cluster of mud volcanoes (the Span-\n\nish Moroccan Field, Gardner, 2001) that lies within\n\nthe accretionary realm but outside the active olistos-\n\ntrome units (Fig. 1). Like other mud volcanoes in\n\nthe Gulf of Cadiz (Somoza et al., 2002), the El\n\nArraiche mud volcanoes evidence episodic expul-\n\nsion of liquidized sediment thought to be related\n\nto the episodic migration of hydrocarbons. This\n\npaper describes the main characteristics of the\n\nmud volcanoes in the El Arraiche field and dis-\n\ncusses their origin, structural setting and the impli-\n\ncations for the hydrocarbon potential of this area\n\noffshore Morocco.\n2. Geological setting\n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz is situated between 98 W to 68\n45V W and 348 N to 37.15V N enclosed by the Iberian\npeninsula and Morocco, west of Gibraltar. The ba-\n\nthymetry is steadily increasing from 200 m at the shelf\n\nedge to depths of over 4 km in the Horseshoe and\n\nSeine abyssal plains. Geologically, the setting of the\n\nGulf of Cadiz is extremely complex and still under\n\ndebate (Sartori et al., 1994; Maldonado et al., 1999;\n\nGutscher et al., 2002). One of the most important\n\nstructures is the large olistostrome complex (or\n\nallochthonous nappes) that were emplaced in the Tor-\n\ntonian in an accretionary wedge-type environment\n\n(Maldonado et al., 1999; Medialdea et al., 2004).\n\nThe main part of the olistostrome unit occupies the\n\ncentral part of the Gulf of Cadiz as a lobe-shaped\n\nstructure that extends over 300 km into the ocean (Fig.\n\n1, Maldonado et al., 1999), its extent seems not yet\n\nwell defined (Maldonado et al., 1999; Somoza et al.,\n\n1999; Medialdea et al., 2004; Maestro et al., 2003).\n\nThe study area is situated south of the main olistos-\n\ntrome unit where thick Late Miocene\u2013Pliocene sedi-\n\nmentary series were deposited in extensional basins at\n\nthe back of advancing allochthonous sheets (Medial-\n\ndea et al., 2004). Mio\u2013Pliocene depocentres are bor-\n\ndered by shallow ridges characterized by large and\n\nactive normal faults (Flinch, 1993), probably super-\n\n\n\nP. Van Rensbergen et al. / Marine Geology 219 (2005) 1\u2013174\nposed on relict Miocene thrust anticlines (Maldonado\n\net al., 1999) or Triassic salt diapir structures (Bera?-\n\nstegui et al., 1998; Somoza et al., 2003).\n\nAll mud volcanoes and other fluid escape features\n\nhave been found within the realm of the accretionary\n\nprism units. They cluster in several mud volcano\n\nfields (Somoza et al., 2003, Fig. 1): the Guadalquivir\n\nDiapir Ridge (GDR) mud volcano field is located at\n\nthe north-western side of the Guadalquivir Ridge at\n\nthe margin of the Tortonian olistostrome unit and at\n\nthe main thrust belt in this area. It is a dense field with\n\n11 identified mud volcanoes, mud cones and large\n\nfluid escape structures in water depths from 380 to\n\n1560 m (Somoza et al., 2003). The term bmud coneQ\nrefers to conical shaped hills without proof of mud\n\nbreccia (Somoza et al., 2003) but is further used here\n\nto indicate the mud volcanic hill. The largest structure,\n\nthe Lolita mud cone, occurs in a water depth of 1560\n\nm and is 316 m high and 5.7 km wide. The Tasyo mud\n\nvolcano field is separated from the GDR mud volcano\n\nfield by the Cadiz undercurrent channel. It lies over\n\nthe north-central part of the main olistostrome unit\n\nand consists of 8 mud volcanoes or mud cones amidst\n\nmany other unidentified circular sea floor structures.\n\nThe largest structure, the Faro mud volcano, is 190 m\n\nhigh and 2.6 km wide and set in a water depth of 795\n\nm. The Deep Portuguese Margin (DPM) mud volcano\n\nfield occupies the distal part of the main olistostrome\n\nunit in water depths between about 2 to 3.2 km. Only\n\nthree mud volcanoes have been discovered in this\n\nlarge area but many other features that resemble\n\nmud volcanoes or mud cones still need to be studied.\n\nThe largest in this mud volcano field is probably the\n\nBonjardim mud volcano that was encountered in a\n\nwater depth of about 3060 m. It is about 100 m high\n\nand about 1 km in diameter (Pinheiro et al., 2002).\n\nThe Spanish-Moroccan (SPM) mud volcano field lies\n\nwithin the bTriassic DiapiricQ structural zone (Somoza\net al., 2003), south of the main olistostrome unit, in a\n\nwater depth of about 600 to 1200 m. The largest\n\nstructure in this area is probably the Ginsburg mud\n\nvolcano that is over 200 m high and about 4 km in\n\ndiameter in a water depth of about 1200 m (Gardner,\n\n2000, 2001).\n\nThe El Arraiche mud volcano field is located at the\n\nsouth-eastern continuation of the Spanish-Moroccan\n\nmud volcano field, offshore the city of Larache. The\n\nmud volcano field is located within the accretionary\nprism structure but outside the realm of the main\n\nolistostrome units. Exploration well LAR-1 is located\n\nabout 8 km east of the study area.\n3. Data\n\nThe multibeam survey on board R/V Belgica used\n\na Kongsberg EM 1002, extended with a deep water\n\nmodule. Maximum sailing speed was 6 knots, with a\n\nswath width of 750 m in shallow water (b500 m) and\n\n500 m in deep water. The acquired data was corrected\n\nand cleaned with the Kongsberg packages Merlin and\n\nNeptune. The footprint at 400 m is 15?15 m. In total\n700 km\n\n2\nwas covered.\n\nA total of 62 high-resolution seismic profiles (Fig.\n\n3) were acquired in three dense grids with a line\n\nspacing of about 1 km centred on the Mercator, Al\n\nIdrissi and Gemini mud volcanoes. The seismic ac-\n\nquisition used a SIG sparker (80 electrodes) with an\n\nenergy of 500 J and a SIG surface single channel\n\nstreamer. In some cases a water gun (15 in.\n3\n) or a\n\nGI-gun (SODERA 35 in.\n3\ngenerator and 35 in.\n\n3\nin-\n\njector) were used. Along 5 lines the IFREMER deep-\n\ntow Chirp source (650\u20132000 Hz) was tested with the\n\nIFREMER deep-tow 2-channel streamer (of which\n\nonly one channel was used during this campaign),\n\nwith excellent results in terms of penetration and\n\nresolution. Seismic profiles were digitally recorded\n\nusing the Elics Delph system. Data processing\n\n(swell-filter, band pass filter, deconvolution and signal\n\namplification) used the Landmark Promax processing\n\nsoftware. Interpretation and mapping was done using\n\nSeismic Microsystems\u2019 Kingdom Suite.\n\nDuring the TTR 12 survey side scan sonar imagery\n\nover the main features (Fig. 3) was acquired using the\n\ndeep-towed hydro\u2013acoustic complex Mak-1, with an\n\noperating frequency of 30 kHz, and a sub bottom\n\nprofiler operating at 5 kHz. The Vernadsky Ridge,\n\nthe deeper part of the Renard Ridge and the Mercator\n\nmud volcano were surveyed with one sidescan sonar\n\nline each, Al Idrissi and Gemini mud volcanoes and\n\nthe upper Renard Ridge were each covered by a mo-\n\nsaic of three lines. Based on the side scan sonar data, 6\n\ntransects were chosen for a deep-towed TV-line, for a\n\ntotal of 15 h. Based on the TV-lines, TV-guided grab\n\nsamples were taken (Fig. 3). Dredge samples of mud\n\nbreccia at the sea floor were taken on Mercator and Al\n\n\n\nFig. 3.

In the craters of the main mud\n\nvolcanoes (Mercator, Al Idrissi, Gemini, and Fiu?za)\n\nthe subsurface was sampled by gravity cores. Four\n\nadditional box cores are also available from the R/V\n\nBelgica survey. The technical details of the equipment\n\nand core analysis strategies during TTR12 survey are\n\nlisted in the cruise report Kenyon et al. (2003). Geo-\n\nchemical sampling was performed on all gravity cores\n\nwithin the El Arraiche mud volcano field at irregular\n\nintervals of about 10 to 30 cm, depending on the\n\nlithology. Geochemical sampling and analysis proce-\n\ndures are described by De Mol et al. (1998) and\n\nStadnitskaia et al. (2002). This paper uses measure-\n\nments of methane concentrations and the ratio between\n\nmethane concentration and the concentration in high\n\nhydrocarbons (C1/C2+).\n4. Data description and interpretation\n\nThe El Arraiche mud volcano field (Fig. 2) con-\n\nsists of at least 8 mud volcanoes of varying size that\n\nare clustered around two sub-parallel sea floor\n\nridges, the Vernadsky and Renard ridges, both with\n\nsteep fault escarpments. The ridges rise up in water\n\ndepths of about 700 m and stretch to the shelf edge.\n\nMost mud volcanoes occur on top of the Renard\n\nridge (Lazarillo de Tormes mud volcano, Gemini\n\nmud volcano, Don Quichote mud volcano and\n\nFiu?za mud volcano). The Kidd mud volcano is\n\nsituated on top of the Vernadsky Ridge.

Van Rensbergen et al. / Marine Geology 219 (2005) 1\u2013178\nThe mud volcanoes stand out as conical hills on the\n\nsea floor with varying slope profiles (Van Rensbergen\n\net al., 2005), mud breccia deposits were found at their\n\ntop. On the seismic data, the mud volcanoes are\n\ncharacterized by a reflection-free seismic facies that\n\nshows stacked outflow lenses within a stratified series\n\nof hemi-pelagic sediments above a regional unconfor-\n\nmity (Fig. 4). This basal unconformity is mapped in\n\nFig. 5 and is used to document the structural setting of\n\nthe mud volcanoes. The following paragraphs will\n\ndescribe each of the mud volcanoes. Statistical and\n\ndescriptive information on the mud volcanoes can be\n\nfound in Table 1.\n\n4.1. Al Idrissi mud volcano\n\nAl Idrissi mud volcano is the largest and shallowest\n\nmud volcano in the field, situated just below the shelf\n\nedge in water depths of about 420 m (Fig. 2). It\n\nappears to be located on a westward plunging anti-\n\ncline (Fig. 5), visible in the bathymetry and on seismic\n\ndata at the eastern side of the Al Idrissi mud volcano\n\nbut almost entirely disappears at its western side.\n\nDeep moats at the base occur at the northern and\n\nsouthern side of the mud cone but they are absent\n\nover the plunging anticline at the western and eastern\n\nsides. The mud volcano is 225 m high, up to 5.4 km\n\nwide at its base and 1.5 km wide at the top (Table 1).\n\nIt is almost circular at the base and has an eye-shaped\n\ncrater at the top. The crater is up to 17 m deep at the\n\nwestern side, the eastern part is occupied by a central\n\ndome-shaped elevation, maximum 42 m above the\n\ncrater floor. The flanks of the mud volcano are dom-\n\ninated by down slope mud flows. On the side scan\n\nsonar mosaic (Fig. 6), mud flows have an even texture\n\nbut return high backscatter in contrast to the pelagic\n\nslope sediments. Backscatter contrast is lower on the\n\nsouthern and eastern flanks probably where pelagic\n\nsediments drape the mud extrusions. Core 411G (Fig.\n\n7) and box cores B1 and B2 at the top and at the\n\nnorthern flank of the central dome reveal a sandy layer\n\nat the surface of 3\u20135 cm thick with a sharp and\n\nirregular limit separating it from a mud breccia.

Mercator mud volcano\n\nThe Mercator mud volcano is set at the southern\n\nflank of the Vernadsky Ridge within a 2 km wide, N\u2013S\n\noriented, collapse zone. This collapse zone is L-shaped\n\nand turns 90 degrees west, north of the Mercator mud\n\nvolcano (Figs. 2 and 5). The mud volcano is an asym-\n\nmetric mud volcano (Fig. 8) with a moat along its\n\nsouthern and western side. It is 141 m high at the\n\nsouthern side, 90 m high at the northern side and\n\nonly 51 m high at its eastern side (Table 1). It has a\n\nmaximum diameter of 2.45 km at the base and 1.1 km at\n\nits top.

Gemini mud volcano\n\nThe Gemini mud volcano occurs south of the large\n\nfault escarpments at the sea floor that bound the south-\n\nern flank of the Renard Ridge (Fig. 2). It consists of two\n\nmud volcanoes in one large oval-shaped mud cone\n\n(Fig. 10). The entire mud volcano is up to 252 m\n\nhigh, 4.1 km long to 2.3 km wide at the base, the\n\nmaximum diameter at the top of the eastern part (Gem-\n\nini East) is 1.3 km and the maximum diameter of the\n\nwestern part (Gemini West) is 0.9 km (Table 1). The\n\nsummits of both Gemini East and Gemini West consist\n\nof a flat crater area with a central dome of respectively\n23 and 27 m above the flat crater area. Core 404G at the\n\neastern summit (Fig. 7) reveals 12 cm of bio-turbated\n\nmarl (hemi-pelagic mud), on top of different layers of\n\nmud breccia. Another marl layer with a thickness of 4\n\ncm occurs at 32 cm depth. The mud breccia is gray and\n\nvery gas-saturated, with randomly distributed rock\n\nclasts. At the western summit is no hemi-pelagic sed-\n\niment. Core 405G (Fig. 7) shows a gray mud breccia\n\nwith a strong H2S smell. The surface layer (11cm) is an\n\noxidized, heavily bioturbated mud breccia. Moats are\n\npresent parallel to the long axis of the mud volcano.\n\n4.4. Other mud volcanoes\n\nFiu?za mud volcano is a smaller mud volcano east of\n\nGemini (Fig. 10). It is located at the western termina-\n\ntion of the Renard Ridge and possibly at the southern\n\ncontinuation of the collapse depression that host the\n\nMercator mud volcano but no faults could be traced in\n\neither direction to its location. The mud volcano is\n\nmaximum 143 m high, 2.2 km wide at the base and has\n\na flat top of up to 0.75 km wide with a central dome of\n\n27 m high and maximum 0.7 km wide (Table 1).

The summits consist of a flat area with a central dome of respectively 20 and 30 m above the flat top. Fiu?za mud volcano is 60 m high, 2.2\n\nkm wide at the base and has a flat top of about 600 m wide with a central dome of 10\u201318 m high and about 300 m wide.\n\nP.

The mud flow\n\ndeposits are typically lens-shaped, convex at the\n\ntop and often fill a moat at the base of the mud\n\nvolcano. In the subsurface, the same pattern returns\n\nat several levels bounded by local unconformities\n\n(Fig. 4). Stacked outflow lenses produce the typical\n\nChristmas-tree morphology of long-lived mud volca-\n\nnoes, similar to other mud volcanoes in the Gulf of\n\nCadiz (Somoza et al., 2002). On the seismic data\n\nonly the tips of the largest outflow deposits are\n\nvisible and probably represent only the largest extru-\n\nsion events. The lateral dimensions of feeder channel\n\nand outflow deposits in the subsurface cannot be\n\nmeasured due to acoustic blanking under almost\n\nthe entire width of the present-day mud volcano.\n\n3D seismic data in other mud volcanic provinces\n\nhave demonstrated that the width of the feeder chan-\n\nnel is probably much smaller than the zone affected\n\nby acoustic blanking or by chaotic reflections (Van\n\nRensbergen et al., 1999).\n\nMoats at the base of mud volcanoes are mostly\n\ninterpreted as subsidence rims related to volume reduc-\ntion caused by degassing and sediment removal (Prior\n\net al., 1989; Camerlenghi et al. 1995). However, high-\n\nresolution seismic profiles across these moats show the\n\ndetails of a cut-and-fill facies, indicating erosion by\n\ncurrents. Somoza et al. (2002) also suggest that the\n\nmoats are caused by erosional currents deflected by\n\nthe mud volcano cone. For the El Arraiche mud volca-\n\nno field, Van Rensbergen et al. (2005) suggest erosion\n\nin combination with subsidence; subsidence rims can\n\nbe deepened by current or smoothed by sediment fill.\n\nThe subsidence rims do not evolve into sediment with-\n\ndrawal synclines but are filled by mud flows and lay-\n\nered hemi-pelagic sediments and re-appear higher in\n\nthe section at a slightly different position.\n\nEpisodic mud extrusion created vertical columns of\n\nremoulded mud up to 500 m below the top of the mud\n\nvolcanoes. The deepest observed occurrence of mud\n\nextrusion deposits is underlain by a regional unconfor-\n\nmity. The unconformity, between 450 and 1250 ms\n\nTWT (or about 350 and 900 m below sea level),\n\nbears witness to a wide-spread erosional event and is\n\nthe base for a seemingly continuous succession of deep\n\n\n\nP. Van Rensbergen et al. / Marine Geology 219 (2005) 1\u20131712\nwater sediments. This basal unconformity is interpreted\n\nto correspond to an important sea level low stand at 2.4\n\nMa (Herna?ndez-Molina et al., 2002). This estimated\n\ndate is well within the age limits obtained by correla-\n\ntion with a near-by industrial well LAR-1 (Flinch et al.,\n\n1996), and yields a reasonable sedimentation rate of\n\nabout 10 cm/ka. The interpreted age (2.4 Ma) of the\n\nregional unconformity can be regarded as an upper\n\nestimate for the duration of the mud volcano activity\n\nin the El Arraiche field.\n\nThe time\u2013structure map of this basal unconformity\n\n(Fig. 5) shows the structural highs and younger normal\n\nfaults at the crests. Fault interpretation from the seismic\n\nsections is difficult due to the fact that data quality at the\n\nmud volcanoes and ridges is not optimal.

Moreover, the subsurface immediately\n\nbelow the mud volcanoes is almost entirely blanked.\n\nOnly mud breccia clasts from the mud volcanoes bear\n\nwitness of the stratigraphy that was traversed by the\n\nmud volcano feeder system. Petrographic studies of\n\nmud breccia clasts retrieved from Al Idrissi and Mer-\n\ncator mud volcanoes by Akhmanov et al. (2002) situate\n\nthe mud volcano field over an Upper Miocene\u2013Plio-\n\ncene sedimentary basin. Smaller limestone clasts indi-\n\ncate that the mud volcano feeder system probably roots\n\nin or below Upper Cretaceous\u2013Miocene rocks, similar\n\nto the other mud volcano fields in the Gulf of Cadiz\n\n(Akhmanov et al., 2002; Ovsyannikov et al., 2003).\n\nUpper Miocene\u2013Pliocene clasts were of exception-\n\nally large size, which indicates the shallow position of\n\nUpper Miocene\u2013Pliocene rocks in this area. On basis\n\nof the near-by exploration well LAR-1 and its corre-\n\nlation with industrial 2D seismic lines (Flinch, 1993),\n\nthe top Pliocene and top Miocene at the Al Idrissi mud\n\nvolcano are estimated to occur respectively at about\n\n150 and 900 m below the sea floor. The base of the\n\nUpper Miocene was not encountered in the 2400 m\n\ndeep LAR-1 drill hole. Hence, the distance of vertical\n\ntransport of the large blocks ranges from 370 m (the\n\ndepth to top Pliocene plus the height of the mud\n\nvolcano) to over a kilometre.\n\nThe source of overpressure seems to be, at least\n\npartly, related to pore fluid volume expansion during\n\nthermogenic gas generation (Barker, 1990). The large\n\nmud volcanoes (Al Idrissi, Gemini, Mercator and\n\nFiu?za) bears witness of repetitive sediment extrusion\nTable 2\n\nOverview of indicators of mud volcanic activity.

Gas\n\ngeneration in Mesozoic source rocks and focussed fluid\n\nflow along the basal detachment of the accretionary\n\nwedge both provide possible sources for sustained and\n\nrepeated fluid injection into the overburden sediments,\n\nprobably increased by periods of tectonic compression.\n\nGeochemical analysis of gravity cores on the mud\n\nvolcanoes (Table 2) yielded hydrocarbon gasses from\n\nthermogenic origin in the crater of Gemini West and\n\ngasses from mixed thermogenic/biogenic in the craters\n\nof Fiu?za and Gemini East mud volcanoes, the latter was\n\ninterpreted by Bileva and Blinova (2002) as evidence\n\nfor a longer period of inactivity. Hydrocarbon gasses\n\nwith thermogenic signature were also retrieved from\n\nGinsberg mud volcano, down slope of the El Arraiche\n\nfield (Mazurenko et al., 2002).\n\n5.2. Mud volcano activity\n\nThe notion of present-day activity of mud volca-\n\nnoes depends on whether fluid or sediment expulsion\n\nis considered. Both processes occur at mud volcanoes\n\nand they are closely related given that fluid flow is the\n\nmain cause of subsurface sediment mobilisation (see\n\ndiscussion by Van Rensbergen et al., 2003). But both\n\nfluid seepage and sediment extrusion activity are dif-\n\nficult to assess and conclusions can diverge as is\n\nillustrated below. Table 2 summarizes the indications\n\nof mud volcano activity for the main mud volcanoes\n\nin the El Arraiche field. The time since the last\n\nsediment extrusion is indicated by the thickness of\n\nhemi-pelagic sediments that cover mud breccia at the\n\ncrater.

At Mercator mud\n\nvolcano, recent extrusion seems to have occurred only\n\nin a narrow zone at the crest of the central dome (Van\n\nRensbergen et al., 2005). The activity of gas seepage\n\ncan be deduced from the depth of the sulfate reduction\n\nzone (SRZ) and by the occurrence of typical seep\n\nfauna. Al Idrissi and Gemini West are the most active\n\nmud volcanoes; there is no or little pelagic drape, the\n\nSRZ is shallowest and the methane concentrations in\n\nthe sediments are high. It is remarkable that the C1/\n\nC2+ ratio at Al Idrissi is typical for biogenic methane\n\nwhereas Gemini West has C1/C2+ ratio typical for\n\nthermogenic methane.\n\n5.3. Structural control on mud volcano occurrences\n\nand its implications for hydrocarbon exploration\n\nThe Vernadsky Ridge anticline and the anticline\n\nbelow Al Idrissi mud volcano continue into the shelf\n\narea where they were mapped by Flinch (1993) on\n\nbasis of regional seismic lines. Flinch et al. (1996)\n\nmapped listric faults over Miocene thrust anticlines\n\nthat bound large Pliocene extensional basins (Fig. 12).\n\nSimilar Pliocene extensional basins have been identi-\n\nfied on regional seismic lines in the central Gulf of\n\nCadiz (IAM-T3 line in Gracia et al., 2003 and in\n\nMedialdea et al., 2004). They formed at the back of\n\nthe advancing sheets (Medialdea et al., 2004), proba-\n\nbly facilitated by the mobilisation of Triassic evapor-\n\nites and Miocene shales (Maestro et al., 2003).\nNW\nSea level\n\nthrust fault\n\nGDR\nfield TASYO field\n\nline-drawing not to scale\n\nalong dense\nfracture zones at active th\n\nFig. 12. General structural cross section of the Gulf of Cadiz showing the m\n\nal., 2003; Flinch, 1993).\nThe structural setting of the El Arraiche field is\n\nthus very different from the GDR, Tasyo and DPM\n\nmud volcano fields in the Gulf of Cadiz and the\n\ngeographical division in mud volcano fields also has\n\ngeological relevance. A generalized line drawing\n\nalong a NW\u2013SE transect illustrates the structural set-\n\nting of the different mud volcano fields (Fig. 12). The\n\nGDR mud volcano field is located at the north-west-\n\nern margin of the Tortonian olistostrome and at the\n\nmajor fold and thrust belt in this area (Gracia et al.,\n\n2003). Large thrusts faults are known to focus fluid\n\nflow at the base of the accretionary system. These\n\nfluids are likely to move upwards along stacked steep\n\ninverse faults at the front thrust zone (GDR field) or at\n\nthrust anticlines within the olistostrome unit (TASYO\n\nfield en DPM field). At places, mud volcanoes are\n\ninterpreted to overlie diapirs of Miocene plastic marly\n\nclays of the olistostrome unit (Maldonado et al., 1999;\n\nSomoza et al., 2003). The olistostrome unit is densely\n\nfractured, thrust anticlines are not continuous and very\n\nirregular, hence mud volcano distribution seems ran-\n\ndom. Pinheiro et al. (2002) indicate that mud volca-\n\nnoes seemed aligned along a conjugate fault system\n\nwith NW\u2013SE and NE\u2013SW direction, probably strike-\n\nslip faults. In any case, the influence of the intensely\n\ndeformed allochthonous units on the distribution of\n\nmud volcanoes and fluid escape features is dominant.\n\nThe SPM mud volcano field and the El Arraiche field\n\nare located outside the main olistostrome unit.

The exact location\n\nof the mud volcanoes depends on the local and re-\n\ngional stress directions. Mercator mud volcano, the\n\nburied mud volcano south of Mercator mud volcano,\n\nand Fiu?za mud volcano seem to occur within a NE\u2013\n\nSW trending deformation zone. Kidd and Adamastor\n\nmud volcanoes, and probably a smaller one just south\n\nof Adamastor, also appear to occur within a NE\u2013SW\n\noriented deformation zone, almost parallel to the col-\n\nlapse depression that host the Mercator mud volcano\n\n(Fig. 11). Sediment injections will occur along fault\n\nsections or fractures perpendicular to the direction of\n\nminimum horizontal stress (Tingay et al., 2003). Since\n\nthe anticlines are most likely compressional struc-\n\ntures, sediment injections are expected to occur\n\nalong fault zones perpendicular to the anticline.\n\nHydrocarbon exploitation in the Gulf of Cadiz only\n\noccurs at the Spanish shelf where Spain\u2019s largest gas\n\nfield, the Poseidon field, produced N500 million Nm\n3\n\nof natural gas in 2002 (Mineco, 2003). The Moroccan\n\nand Portuguese margins are largely under explored,\n\nonly 5 wildcats were drilled at the Portuguese margin\n\nin the Algarve basin (IGM, 2003) and 1 at the Mor-\n\noccan shelf offshore the city of Larache (ONAREP,\n\n2003). In the entire Gulf of Cadiz only 7 exploration\n\nwells were drilled at water depths N200 m. The main\n\nhydrocarbon source rock is Early to Middle Jurassic\n\noil and gas prone shale. Oil generation was estimated\n\nto occur since Toarcian times (ONAREP, 2003). The\n\nmost important reservoir rocks are Jurassic reefal\n\nbuild-ups and Cretaceous deltaic sands. In the deep\n\nwater areas Tertiairy turbidites and carbonates are\n\nconsidered to be possible reservoir rocks (ONAREP,\n\n2003). Hydrocarbon exploration in the Gulf of Cadiz\n\nis hampered by the intense deformation and nappes\n\nemplacement since the Tortonian. Mud volcanoes in\n\nthe entire Gulf of Cadiz seem to root in Cretacous to\n\nMiocene rocks (Akhmanov et al., 2002), below or\n\nwithin the olistostrome units. Somoza et al. (1999)\n\nsuggest large possible hydrocarbon accumulations\n\nbelow the salt-floored olistostrome units. In the cen-\n\ntral part of the Gulf of Cadiz the structural deforma-\n\ntion extends up to the sediment surface and controls\n\nthe distribution of mud volcanoes in the GDR, Tasyo\nand DPM mud volcano fields. This may indicate a\n\nredistribution of hydrocarbon fluids from deeper\n\nsources along several fault-controlled pathways\n\nthrough the allochthonous complex. In the SPM and\n\nthe El Arraiche mud volcanoes fields, most of accre-\n\ntionary wedge thrust anticlines are sealed by a thick\n\nPliocene section and may host considerable hydroca-\n\nbon accummulations. The area offshore El Arraiche\n\nremains poorly tested for hydrocarbon accummula-\n\ntions but seems to have very good potential.\n6. Conclusions\n\nThe newly discovered El Arraiche field at the\n\nMoroccan Atlantic margin, Gulf of Cadiz, consists\n\nof 8 mud volcanoes of varying size and shape just\n\nbelow the Moroccan shelf edge. The largest mud\n\nvolcano, Al Idrissi mud volcano, is 225 m high and\n\n5.3 km in diameter, the smallest observed mud vol-\n\ncano is only 25 m high and 500 m wide. The mud\n\nvolcanoes seem to be associated with extensional\n\nfaults with quickly varying throw and strike that\n\ncompartmentalize anticlinal ridges. The anticlines\n\ncan be traced regionally and bound extensional basins\n\nthat formed during the Late Miocene.\n\nThe El Arraiche mud volcano field is part of a\n\nlarger cluster of mud volcanoes (the Spanish Moroc-\n\ncan Field, Gardner, 2001) that lie within the accre-\n\ntionary realm but outside the active olistostrome units.\n\nThis distinction is clear on regional seismic lines\n\n(Gracia et al., 2003; Medialdea et al., 2004) but it\n\nalso has bearings on the composition and the size of\n\nrock clasts in the mud volcanoes (Akhmanov et al.,\n\n2002). As other mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz\n\n(Somoza et al., 2002), the El Arraiche mud volcanoes\n\nare long-lived structures thought to be related to the\n\nepisodic migration of hydrocarbons. Onset of mud\n\nvolcanic activity in the El Arraiche field is estimated\n\nat about 2.4 Ma. Since the Upper Pliocene, episodic\n\nexpulsion of liquidized sediment created vertical piles\n\nof extruded mud of up to 500 m thick.\n\nThe occurrence of large mud volcanoes bears wit-\n\nness of continued overpressure generation at depth,\n\neither by in situ oil and gas generation or by focussed\n\nflow and accumulation in the area. The activity of the\n\nmud volcanoes is indicated by the thickness of hemi-\n\npelagic sediments covering extruded mud breccia, the\n\n\n\nP.

These indica-\n\ntions give variable results. Gemini West and Al Idrissi\n\nmud volcanoes are most active, as they lack a hemi-\n\npelagic sediment drape, feature a shallow sulphate\n\nreduction zone, high concentrations of methane, and\n\nliving Pogonophora worms. The ratio of methane con-\n\ncentration over the concentration of higher homologues\n\ngives a biogenic gas source in case of the Al Idrissi mud\n\nvolcano and a thermogenic signature for the Gemini\n\nWest crater. The eastern twin crater, Gemini East, was\n\nthe least active, covered by 12 cm of hemi-pelagic mud.\n\nGiven its structural setting and the evidence of thermo-\n\ngenic hydrocarbons, the area has promising hydrocar-\n\nbon potential but remains untested.\nAcknowledgement\n\nThe study frames into ESF\u2019s MVSeis and Mound-\n\nforce projects.

During the R/V SONNE expedition \u2018\u2018GAP\u2013Gibraltar Arc Processes (SO-\n175)\u2019\u2019 in December 2003, several mud volcanoes were surveyed for gas seepage and associated microbial methane turnover. Pore water\nanalyses and methane oxidation measurements on sediment cores recovered from the centres of the mud volcanoes Captain Arutyunov,\nBonjardim, Ginsburg, Gemini and a newly discovered, mud volcano-like structure called \u2018\u2018No Name\u2019\u2019 show that thermogenic methane\nand associated higher hydrocarbons rising from deeper sediment strata are completely consumed within the seabed. The presence of a\ndistinct sulphate\u2013methane transition zone (SMT) overlapping with high sulphide concentrations suggests that methane oxidation is med-\niated under anaerobic conditions with sulphate as the electron acceptor. Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) and sulphate reduction\n(SR) rates show maxima at the SMT, which was found between 20 and 200 cm below seafloor at the different mud volcanoes. In com-\nparison to other methane seeps, AOM activity (<383 mmol m?2 year?1) and diffusive methane fluxes (<321 mmol m?2 year?1) in mud\nvolcano sediments of the Gulf of Cadiz are low to mid range. Corresponding lipid biomarker and 16S rDNA clone library analysis give\nevidence that AOM is mediated by a mixed community of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea and associated sulphate reducing bacteria\n(SRB) in the studied mud volcanoes. Little is known about the variability of methane fluxes in this environment. Carbonate crusts\nlittering the seafloor of mud volcanoes in the northern part of the Gulf of Cadiz had strongly 13C-depleted lipid signatures indicative\nof higher seepage activities in the past. However, actual seafloor video observations showed only scarce traces of methane seepage\nand associated biological processes at the seafloor. No active fluid or free gas escape to the hydrosphere was observed visually at any\nof the surveyed mud volcanoes, and biogeochemical measurements indicate a complete methane consumption in the seafloor. Our\nobservations suggest that the emission of methane to the hydrosphere from the mud volcano structures studied here may be insignificant\nat present.\n? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n1.

Niemann).\ncoupled to variations in atmospheric methane, are impor-\ntant rationales of current biogeochemical research. Anthro-\npogenic sources as well as natural emission from wetlands\ncontribute significantly to the global emission of methane\nto the atmosphere, but the role of the ocean in global meth-\nane fluxes is not well understood (Reeburgh, 1996; Judd\net al., 2002). Recently, marine mud volcanism has been\nidentified as an important escape pathway for methane\n\nmailto:hniemann@mpi-bremen.de\n\n\nMud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz 5337\nand higher hydrocarbons (Dimitrov, 2002; Judd et al.,\n2002; Dimitrov, 2003). Mud volcanism is caused by various\ngeological processes at continental margins such as tectonic\naccretion and faulting, rapid burial of sediments and emis-\nsion of gases and fluids. Such processes may lead to high\npore fluid pressures and sediment instabilities, and conse-\nquently cause mud extrusions. Since subsurface muds and\nshales of productive continental margins often contain\nmethane and other hydrocarbons of thermogenic and/or\nmicrobial origin, mud flows can be accompanied by gas\nexpulsion (Milkov, 2000; Kopf, 2002; Charlou et al.,\n2003; Somoza et al., 2003). Mud volcanoes (MVs) are\nstructurally diverse, ranging in shape from amorphous\nmud pies to conical structures, and in size from a few\nmetres to kilometres in diametre, attaining heights of up\nto a few 100 m (Dimitrov, 2002; Kopf, 2002). While there\nare only 650\u2013900 known terrestrial mud volcanoes (Kopf,\n2003), global estimates for marine mud volcanoes range be-\ntween 800 and 100,000 (Milkov, 2000; Dimitrov, 2002,\n2003; Kopf, 2003; Milkov et al., 2003). It is unknown\nhow many of these submarine mud volcanoes are actively\nemitting methane to the hydrosphere. As a result, global\nestimates of methane emissions from these structures vary\nconsiderably. Recent estimates suggest that terrestrial and\nshallow water mud volcanoes contribute between 2.2 and\n6 Tg year?1 of methane to the atmosphere (Dimitrov,\n2003; Milkov et al., 2003) and that 27 Tg year?1 of meth-\nane may escape from deep water mud volcanoes (Milkov\net al., 2003). Revised estimates of the total methane emis-\nsion from MVs ranges between 35 and 45 Tg year?1 (Eti-\nope and Milkov, 2004), 30 and 70 Tg year?1 (Etiope and\nKlusman, 2002), and\u2014when using only known MVs and\ncorrecting for size of the edifice\u2014between 0.3 (Kopf,\n2003) and 1.4 Tg year?1 (Kopf, 2002). Clearly, a better\nunderstanding of mud volcano activity and methane turn-\nover at these structures is needed, to evaluate the contribu-\ntion of mud volcanism to the total annual methane\nemission to the atmosphere (535 Tg year?1, Judd et al.,\n2002).\n\nThe main sink for methane in the ocean is the anaerobic\noxidation of methane (AOM) with sulphate as the terminal\nelectron acceptor (Barnes and Goldberg, 1976; Reeburgh,\n1976; Iversen and J\u00f8rgensen, 1985; Hinrichs and Boetius,\n2002; Nauhaus et al., 2002; Treude et al., 2003). This pro-\ncess is mediated by archaea, operating most likely in coop-\neration with sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB) (Hinrichs\net al., 1999; Boetius et al., 2000; Orphan et al., 2001). So\nfar, two groups of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea\n(ANME-1, ANME-2) have been identified (Hinrichs\net al., 1999; Boetius et al., 2000; Orphan et al., 2001;\nMichaelis et al., 2002; Knittel et al., 2005). They usually oc-\ncur together with SRB from a distinct, yet uncultivated\ncluster within the Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus group\n(Seep-SRB1; Knittel et al., 2003). Generally, microbial\nmethane oxidation is characterised by a strong discrimina-\ntion against the heavy, stable carbon isotope 13C, leading\nto a significant depletion in the 13C-content of metabolites\nand biomass (Reeburgh and Heggie, 1977; Whiticar et al.,\n1986; Summons et al., 1994; Elvert et al., 1999; Thiel et al.,\n1999; Whiticar, 1999; Orphan et al., 2001). Such conspicu-\nous isotope signatures of lipid biomarkers for the archaeal\nand bacterial partners in AOM mediating communities\nhave been a main tool in studying the diversity and func-\ntioning of cold seep ecosystems (Hinrichs et al., 1999; Pan-\ncost et al., 2000; Elvert et al., 2001; Orphan et al., 2001;\nMichaelis et al., 2002; Elvert et al., 2003; Blumenberg\net al., 2004; Elvert et al., 2005; Niemann et al., 2005). Ac-\ntive mud volcanoes in the Mediterranean Sea, e.g. Napoli,\nAmsterdam and Kazan (Pancost et al., 2000; Aloisi et al.,\n2002; Haese et al., 2003; Werne et al., 2004); the Black\nSea, e.g. Dvurechenskii and Odessa (Bohrmann et al.,\n2003; Stadnitskaia et al., 2005); and the Barents Sea, e.g.\nHa?kon Mosby (Vogt et al., 1997a,b; Damm and Bude?us,\n2003; De Beer et al., 2006) are characterised by steep gradi-\nents of pore water solutes due to upward fluid and gas flow\nand high rates of AOM and sulphate reduction (SR). Sev-\neral of these geo-bio-systems were also found to support\nenormous biomasses of chemosynthetic symbiotic tube-\nworms and bivalves, which are fuelled by methane and/or\nsulphide, and mats of giant sulphide oxidising bacteria,\n(Southward et al., 1981; Fisher, 1990; Olu et al., 1997a;\nGebruk et al., 2003).\n\nDuring the UNESCO program \u2018\u2018Training through Re-\nsearch (TTR)\u2019\u2019 with R/V Prof. Logachev, numerous mud\nvolcanoes hosting methane-hydrate were discovered in\nthe Gulf of Cadiz (Kenyon et al., 2000; Gardner, 2001;\nKenyon et al., 2001; Mazurenko et al., 2002; Somoza\net al., 2002; Pinheiro et al., 2003). However, the geochem-\nical and microbiological activity of these potential seep\nstructures and the occurrence of methane emission to the\nhydrosphere remained unknown. As part of the Gibraltar\nArch Project (GAP), we studied several mud volcanoes\nwith the aid of seafloor video imaging as well as video-\nguided sampling of sediments and carbonate crusts during\na cruise with R/V Sonne in 2003 (SO-175). The main goals\nof this investigation were to survey the occurrence of meth-\nane seepage at mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz, to com-\npare the distribution and magnitude of AOM by rate\nmeasurements and diffusive flux calculations, as well as to\nidentify the key methanotrophs using lipid biomarker and\n16S rDNA methods.\n\n2.

Bathymetric chart of the Gulf of Cadiz showing the locations of known mud volcanoes, diapirs and areas where carbonate chimneys and crusts\nwere discovered. The structures studied during the SO-175 expedition are in bold face letters.\n\n5338 H. Niemann et al. 70 (2006) 5336\u20135355\nthe Betic Cordillera (Spain) and Rif Massif (Morocco) was\nemplaced west of the Straits of Gibraltar (Maldonado and\nComas, 1992; Somoza et al., 2003). Due to the ongoing\ncompression, these rapidly deposited sediments dewater\nintensely and form MVs and fluid escape structures\n(Diaz-Del-Rio et al., 2003). The Gulf of Cadiz has been\nintensely surveyed with geophysical tools, leading to the\ndiscovery of the first MVs, mud diapirs and pockmarks\nin 1999 (Kenyon et al., 2000; Gardner, 2001; Pinheiro\net al., 2003). In addition, an extensive field of mud volca-\nnoes and diapiric structures covered with carbonate chim-\nneys and crusts was discovered along or in close\nproximity of the main channels of the Mediterranean out-\nflow water (Kenyon et al., 2000, 2001; Diaz-Del-Rio et al.,\n2003; Somoza et al., 2003; Kopf et al., 2004).\n\nIn the present study, Captain Arutyunov (Capt. Arutyu-\nnov), Bonjardim, Ginsburg, Gemini, Hesperides and Faro\nMV and a newly discovered structure termed \u2018\u2018No Name\u2019\u2019,\nwere investigated (Fig. 1, Table 1). Prior to biogeochemical\nsampling, a few transects across the selected MVs were sur-\nveyed with the video-sled Ocean Floor Observation System\n(OFOS), or with a video-guided multiple-corer (MUC, Ta-\nble 1). Both systems are equipped with powerful lamps and\na video camera. Video observations were made from a ver-\ntical perspective at ca. 1\u20132 m above the sea bottom to mon-\nitor an area of approximately 1 m2. The systems were\npassively towed at minimum speed (<1.84 km h?1) along\n2\u20133 transects of 1\u20133 km crossing the rim and apex of the\nedifices with a total bottom observation time of approxi-\nmately 8 h per mud volcano (Table 1, Kopf et al., 2004).\nThe video-guided MUC was also used to select representa-\ntive sampling positions and to retrieve undisturbed surface\nsediments (next section).\n\n2.2. Sample collection and storage\n\nSediments from several mud volcanoes were sampled by\ngravity coring in the central crater region (Table 1, Fig. 2),\nretrieving up to 5 m of sediment. Additionally, surface sed-\niments of Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV were ob-\ntained with a video-guided MUC because the top\ndecimetres of sediment cover are often lost during gravity\ncore retrieval. Video-guided MUC sampling enabled the\nretrieval of undisturbed surface sediments of up to 50 cm\nsediment depth. With this method, the seafloor can be ob-\nserved when the MUC is towed at minimum speed at about\n1\u20132 m above bottom. The MUC is launched immediately\nwhen targeted seafloor structures are observed. Compared\nto the gravity core, MUC-cores contained a broader hori-\nzon of hemipelagic surface sediments providing further evi-\ndence for a loss of surface sediments during gravity coring.\nTo account for this loss, we aligned the depth of gravity\ncores obtained from Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim\nMV according to the vertical sulphate profiles of MUC-\ncores recovered from one site, assuming that sulphate con-\ncentrations are mainly a function of depth in proximate\ncores. According to this procedure, the top of the gravity\ncores recovered from Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim\n\n\n\nTable 1\nMud volcanoes investigated during the cruise SO-175\n\nStructure Relief [m] Diam. [km] Water depth [m] Device Core/Grab Lat. N Long.

Seismic images and 3D images of multibeam bathymetry of Captain Arutyunov (a) and Bonjardim mud volcano (b). Seismic images show the\ncentral conduit below the mud volcanoes and sampling position of the cores recovered during the SO-175 expedition. Captain Arutyunov and Bonjardim\nMV are conical shaped structures with a relief of 80 and 100 m and a diametre of ca. 2 and 1 km, respectively. Colours denote the bathymetry (m below sea\nsurface). Seismic images were modified after Kenyon et al. (2001) (a) and Pinheiro et al. (2003) (b).\n\nMud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz 5339\nMV were from 40 to 12.5 cm sediment depth, respectively.\nAligning proximate core sections is an approach to\naccount for a loss of an unknown quantity of surface\nsediments during gravity coring. However, this can be\nproblematic if the spatial variability of geochemical gradi-\nents is high.\n\nUpon recovery, gravity cores were sectioned into 1 m\npieces, which were cut longitudinally into halves, just be-\nfore sub sampling. All cores were immediately transferred\ninto a cold room and subsampled for concentration mea-\nsurements of pore water constituents (methane, sulphate,\nsulphide), AOM and SR rate measurements as well as for\nlipid biomarker and 16S rDNA analyses (Table 1). Sedi-\nments for measurements of methane and sulphate concen-\ntrations and turnover rate measurements were subsampled\nvertically with push cores (acrylic core liners, 26 mm dia-\nmetre, n = 3) from MUC-cores (J\u00f8rgensen, 1978; Treude\net al., 2003). Gravity cores were subsampled by plugging\n\n\n\n5340 H. Niemann et al. 70 (2006) 5336\u20135355\nglass tubes (60 mm length, 10 mm diametre, n = 5) into\nselected ca. 10 cm wide sediment horizons (every 20\u2013\n30 cm). The tubes were then sealed with butyl rubber stop-\npers to prevent gas loss during the anaerobic incubation.\nSediment samples for pore water extraction, biomarker\nand 16S rDNA analyses were collected from 2 cm sections\nof MUC-cores and from ca. 10 cm wide sediment horizons\n(every 20\u201330 cm) of gravity core sections. Directly after\nsubsampling, pore water from these sediment horizons\nwas extracted by pressure filtration (5 bars) through Teflon\nsqueezers provided with 0.2 lm cellulose acetate filters\naccording to previous works (Reeburgh, 1967; Niewo?hner\net al., 1998; Hensen et al., 2003). Subsequently, the pore\nwater was immediately fixed (next section). Lipid and\nDNA samples were stored in cleaned glass vials at\n?20 ?C until extraction in the home laboratory. Carbonate\ncrusts from Hesperides and Faro MV were collected with a\nvideo-guided grab-sampler (Table 1). Because Hesperides\nMV consist of six individual cones, the grab sample was\ntaken from the apex of the highest (north-eastern) summit.\nThe grab-sampler allows to retrieve samples down to a\ndepth of ca. 0.5 m below seafloor (bsf). The videographic\nobservation and sampling procedure is similar to the tech-\nnique used for video-guided coring as explained above.\nUpon recovery, carbonate crusts for lipid biomarker anal-\nyses were transferred into plastic bags and stored at ?20 ?C\nuntil extraction.\n\n2.3. Methane concentrations\n\nMethane concentrations in sediments were determined\naccording to the \u2018\u2018head space\u2019\u2019 method from 5 ml sediment\nfixed with 10 ml NaOH (2.5%, w/v) in glass vials (20 ml) as\ndescribed previously by Treude and co-workers (2003). A\nvertical resolution of 2 cm was chosen for surface samples\nfrom MUC-cores, and of 20\u201330 cm for subsurface samples\nfrom gravity cores. The concentrations presented here are\nex situ methane concentrations. As a result of depressurisa-\ntion and warming of the core during sediment retrieval,\nconcentrations above 1.4 mM (saturation at 1 bar and\n4 ?C) would have led to degassing during retrieval and sed-\niment subsampling. Also, dissociation of gas hydrates upon\nrecovery may lead to biased methane concentrations in the\ncores. We tried to minimise the problem by (a) subsampling\nimmediately after opening the core, and (b) subsampling of\ndeeper sediments below the longitudinal opening plane of\nthe gravity core with glass syringes. Methane concentra-\ntions were determined shortly after the cruise (<2 month)\nfrom 200 ll aliquots of the head space using a gas chro-\nmatograph (5890A, Hewlett Packard) equipped with a\npacked stainless steal Porapak-Q column (6 ft., 0.125 in,\n80/100 mesh, Agilent Technologies) and a flame ionisation\ndetector (Treude et al., 2003). The carrier gas was helium at\na flow rate of 30 ml min?1. The column temperature was\n40 ?C. The chromatography system was calibrated for a\nconcentration range of 0.001\u20135 mM methane (final concen-\ntration in the sediment). Sediment samples from Capt.\nArutyunov and Bonjardim MV were additionally analysed\nfor the concentrations of the higher hydrocarbons (C2+)\nethane, propane, isobutene and butane (Rbutane) using\nthe above-described chromatography setting with a tem-\nperature gradient. Subsequent to injection at 40 ?C, the\ntemperature was increased at a rate of 2 ?C min?1 to\n200 ?C and held for 20 min. Identity and concentrations\nof methane and C2+-compounds were determined with\nstandards of known hydrocarbon compositions.\n\n2.4. Sulphate and sulphide concentrations\n\nSulphate and sulphide concentrations were analysed\naccording to modified methods from Cline (1969) and\nSmall et al. (1975), respectively, as described elsewhere\n(Grasshoff et al., 1983). Briefly, sulphide concentrations\nwere determined immediately after pore water squeezing\nby adding 1 ml of pore water to 50 ll of a zinc acetate gel-\natine solution. Zinc acetate gelatine solution consists of\n50 mg gelatine and 261 mg ZnAc dissolved in 25 ml O2-free\nwater. Sulphide was quantitatively removed as ZnS and\nkept in colloidal solution. After adding 10ll of 4% N,N-di-\nmethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine-dihydrochloride dissolved in\n6 N HCl (w/v), the concentration was determined photo-\nmetrically by measuring the absorbance after 1 h at\n670 nm. Sulphate concentrations were determined on 2 ml\nsubsamples of filtered pore water using a Sykam-S ion\nchromatography system equipped with an anion exchange\ncolumn (LCA A14). 7.5 mM Na2CO3-solution was used as\nan eluent at a flow rate of 1.75 ml min?1. Samples were\ndiluted by 1:54 with the eluent prior to injection. Sulphate\nconcentrations were determined with a Sykam S3110 con-\nductivity detector.\n\n2.5. Diffusive flux calculations\n\nDiffusive fluxes were calculated to compare areal rates of\nAOM and SR, to estimate the activity of Ginsburg and\nGemini mud volcano as well as the No Name structure\nand to compare the surveyed systems to other seeps in\nthe world oceans. This approach bears several problems,\nnamely potential artefacts in the ex situ concentrations of\nporewater species due to degassing, the assumption of stea-\ndy state in the porewater system, and the alignment of sed-\niment cores. At Bonjardim mud volcano, the alignment of\npore water profiles was discontinuous, while the resolution\nof pore water gradients was not well resolved at Ginsburg\nand Gemini mud volcano. Where possible, we determined\ntwo concentration gradients: one from the aligned profile\nand the other from the profile of the gravity core in order\nto provide a possible range of the sulphate and sulphide\nfluxes.\n\nLocal fluxes (J) were calculated from the vertical profiles\nof pore water constituents (methane, sulphate, sulphide)\naccording to Fick\u2019s first law of diffusion assuming steady\nstate conditions (e.g. Niewo?hner et al., 1998; Berner, 1980\nand references therein):\n\n\n\nMud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz 5341\nJ \u00bc?/Ds\ndC\ndx\n\n\u00f01\u00de\n\nwhere Ds is the diffusion coefficient in the sediments (in\ncm2 year?1), / the porosity (in %) and dC\n\ndx\nthe local concen-\n\ntration gradient (in cm?4). dC\ndx\n\nwas determined from the\ndepth intervals where the concentration change was maxi-\nmal. Ds was determined from the molecular diffusion coef-\nficient after Boudreau (1997)\n\nDs \u00bc\nD0\n\n1 ? ln\u00f0/\u00de2\n\u00f02\u00de\n\nFor each mud volcano, D0 values were corrected for tem-\nperature (3\u201312 ?C, depending on the actual bottom water\ntemperature), resulting in values ranging between 291 to\n392, 178 to 244 and 356 to 434 for methane, sulphate\nand sulphide, respectively (Boudreau, 1997). / was deter-\nmined from the weight loss per volume of wet sediment\nafter drying to stable weight at 60 ?C. In general, / de-\ncreased with depth showing values of 57\u201376% in the top\nsections and 51\u201360% in the bottom sections of the retrieved\nMUC- and GC-cores (data shown for the SMT, Table 2).\n\n2.6. Ex situ AOM and SR rate measurements\n\nSediment for turnover rate measurements recovered\nfrom Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV were incubated\non board according to previously described methods\n(J\u00f8rgensen, 1978; Treude et al., 2003; Treude et al.,\n2005). Briefly, 25 ll 14CH4 (dissolved in water, 2.5 kBq)\nor 5 ll 35SO4\n\n2? tracer (dissolved in water, 50 kBq) were\ninjected into butyl rubber sealed glass tubes from gravity\ncore subsampling, and in 1 cm intervals into small push\ncores (whole core injection) used for MUC-core subsam-\npling. Incubations were carried out for 24 h at in situ tem-\nperature in the dark. Subsequently, incubated AOM and\nSR rate samples were fixed in 25 ml NaOH (2.5%, w/v)\nand 25 ml zinc acetate solution (20%, w/v), respectively.\nFurther processing of AOM and SR rate samples was per-\nformed according to Treude et al. (2003) and references\ntherein. Turnover rates were calculated according to the\nfollowing formulas:\nTable 2\nConcentrations gradients, diffusive fluxes and ex situ AOM and SR rates inte\n\nStructure Core GeoB Porosity [%] Conc. gradient\n[lmol cm?4]\n\nCH4 SO4\n2?

To com-\npare ex situ microbial rates with the diffusive fluxes of\nmethane and sulphate, AOM and SR rates were integrated\nover depth (0\u201380 cm below seafloor) from the alignments\nof cores 9036-2 and 9041-4 as well as 9051-1 and 9051-2,\nrespectively. Ex situ rate measurements may differ from\nin situ rates due to the effect of depressurisation on concen-\ntrations of gaseous and dissolved components.\n2.7. Extraction of sediment and carbonate samples and\n\npreparation of derivates\n\nSediments from Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV as\nwell as carbonate crusts from Hesperides and Faro MV\nwere analysed for lipid biomarker signatures. The extrac-\ntion procedure and preparation of fatty acid methyl esters\n(FAMES) was carried out according to previously de-\nscribed methods (Gillian et al., 1981; Elvert et al., 2003;\nNiemann et al., 2005). Briefly, total lipid extracts (TLE)\nwere obtained from ca. 20 g of wet sediment and from\nauthigenic carbonates disintegrated with HCL (2 M) prior\nto extraction. The TLE was extracted by subsequent ultra-\nsonication using organic solvents of decreasing polarity\n(dichloromethane/methanol (1:2, v/v), dichloromethane/\nmethanol (2:1 v/v), dichloromethane). Internal standards\nof known concentration and carbon isotopic compositions\nwere added prior to extraction. Fatty acid moieties present\nin glyco and phospholipids were cleaved by saponification\nwith methanolic KOH-solution. After extraction of the\nneutral lipid fraction from this mixture, fatty acids (FAs)\nwere methylated with BF3 in methanol yielding FAMES.\nDouble bond positions of monoenoic FAs were determined\ngrated over depth\n\nDiffusive fluxes\n[mmol m?2 year?1]\n\nMicrobial turnover\n[mmol m?2 year?1]\n\nphide CH4 RSO4\n2?

Alcohols were derivatised with bis(trimethylsilyl)tri-\nflouracetamid (BSTFA) forming trimethylsilyl (TMS)\nethers prior to analyses.\n\n2.8. Gas chromatography\n\nConcentrations of single lipid compounds were deter-\nmined by gas chromatography analysis using a Varian\n30 m apolar CP-Sil 8 CB fused silica capillary (0.25 mm\ninternal diametre [ID], film thickness 0.25 lm) in a Hewlett\nPackard 6890 Series gas chromatograph equipped with an\non column injector and a flame ionisation detector. Initial\noven temperature was 80 ?C. Subsequently to injection, the\ninitial temperature was increased to 130 ?C at a rate of\n20 ?C min?1, then raised to 320 ?C at a rate of\n4 ?C min?1and held at 320 ?C for 30 min. The carrier was\nhelium at a constant flow of 2 ml min?1 and the detector\ntemperature was set to 310 ?C. Concentrations were calcu-\nlated relative to internal standards present within the\nrespective lipid fraction.\n\n2.9. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS),\ngas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry\n\n(GC-IRMS)\n\nIdentity and stable carbon isotope ratios of individual\ncompounds were determined by GC-MS and GC-IRMS\nanalysis, respectively. Instrument specifications and opera-\ntion modes of the GC-MS and GC-IRMS units were set\naccording to Elvert et al. (2003). Identities of acquired mass\nspectra were compared to known standards and published\ndata. Stable isotope ratios are given in the d-notation\nagainst Pee Dee Belemnite. d13C-values of FAs and alco-\nhols were corrected for the introduction of additional car-\nbon atoms during derivatisation. Internal standards were\nused to monitor precision and reproducibility during mea-\nsurements. Reported d13C-values have an analytical error\nof \u00b11&amp;.\n\n2.10. DNA extraction and clone library construction\n\nTotal community DNA was extracted from sediments\n(ca. 1 g) collected from the SMT of Capt. Arutyunov MV\n(30\u201340 cm) using the FastDNA spin kit for soil (Q-Bio-\ngene, Irvine, California, USA). Samples were bead-beat\nin a Fastprep machine (Q-Biogene, Irvine, California,\nUSA) at speed 4.5 for 30 s. All other steps in the DNA\nextraction procedure were preformed according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Almost full-length\narchaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified\nfrom sediments samples using the primers 20f (Massana\net al., 1997) and Uni1392R (Lane et al., 1985) for Archaea\nand GM3F (Muyzer et al., 1995) and GM4R (Kane et al.,\n1993) for Bacteria. Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs)\nwere performed with TaKaRa Ex Taq (TaKaRa, Otsu Ja-\npan), using 2.5 U of enzyme, 1\u00b7 Buffer, 4 mM of MgCl2,\n4 mM of each dNTP, 1 lM of each primer and 2 ll of tem-\nplate in a 50 ll reaction. PCRs were preformed in a Mas-\ntercycler machine (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), with\nthe following cycling conditions: 95 ?C for 2 min, then 30\ncycles of 95 ?C for 30 s, 60 ?C (Archaea) or 50 ?C (Bacteria)\nfor 30 s and 72 ?C for 3 min, followed by a final incubation\nstep at 72 ?C for 10 min. PCR products were visualised on\nan agarose gel, and the 16S band excised. PCR products\nwere purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qia-\ngen, Hilden, Germany). Two microliters of purified DNA\nwere ligated in the pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega, Mad-\nison, WI) and transformed into competent E. coli TOP10\ncells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufac-\nturer\u2019s recommendations. Transformation reactions were\nplated on LB-agarose plates. Overnight cultures were pre-\npared from individual colonies picked from these plates\nusing the Montage Plasmid Miniprep 96 kit (Millipore,\nBillerica, USA). Purified plasmids were sequenced in one\ndirection, with either the 958R (Archaea) or GM1F (Bacte-\nria) primers using the BigDye Terminator v3.0 Cycle\nSequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA).\nSamples were sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 3100\nGenetic Analyser (Foster City, USA). A total of 39 archa-\neal and 47 bacterial clones were partially sequenced\n(?0.5 kb). Using the ARB software package, the sequences\nwere calculated into existing phylogentic trees by parsimo-\nny without allowing a change in the tree topology. Repre-\nsentative sequences of each cluster were then fully\nsequenced (?1.3 kb) and matched against the NCBI data-\nbase (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). Sequences\nwere submitted to the Genbank database (http://\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and are accessible under the fol-\nlowing Accession Nos.: DQ004661\u2013DQ004676 and\nDQ004678\u2013DQ004680.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Field observations\n\nA detailed description of seafloor video observations,\nsedimentology and sampling locations is provided in the\ncruise report of R/V SONNE expedition SO-175 (Kopf\net al., 2004). The mud volcanoes Capt. Arutyunov, Bonjar-\ndim, Ginsburg, Gemini, and Faro studied here are cone\nshaped structures with a relief of up to 200 m and a maxi-\nmum diametre of 4.9 km (Fig. 2a, b; Table 1). Hesperides\nMV has comparable dimensions but is composed of six\nindividual cones. A new structure was discovered east of\nthe TTR MV and termed \u2018\u2018No Name\u2019\u2019 (Fig. 1). Video\nobservations of the mud volcanoes Capt. Arutyunov, Bon-\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\n\n\nMud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz 5343\njardim, Ginsburg, Hesperides, and Faro did not reveal\nindications for recent gas, fluid or mud expulsion during\nthe transects across the central craters of each structure.\nThe centres of Capt. Arutyunov, Bonjardim and Ginsburg\nMV were covered with light beige sediments (shown for\nCapt. Arutyunov MV, Fig. 3a). At Capt. Arutyunov\nMV, some sediment stretches were scattered with accre-\ntions, interpreted as mud clasts, which may indicate past\nmud eruptions (Fig. 3b). At Ginsburg MV, a few small car-\nbonate crusts (<0.5 m) were observed on the seafloor. Be-\nside these observations, no other distinctive geological or\nbiological features indicating gas or fluid seepage were vis-\nible on video images at Ginsburg MV. Surface sediments\nrecovered from Capt. Arutyunov MV contained very thin\ntubeworms (diametre&lt;1 mm), which extended down to\n20 cm into the sediment. These were not visible on video\nimages due to their low abundance and small diametre.\nTubeworms are regarded as indicator species for reduced\nenvironments because the known species harbour methane\nor sulphide oxidising symbionts, indicating sulphide and/or\nmethane availability in the sediments (Southward et al.,\n1981, 1986; Schmaljohann and Flugel, 1987; Sibuet and\nOlu, 1998; Kimura et al., 2003; Southward et al., 2005).\nThe central areas of Hesperides and Faro MV were littered\nwith fragments of carbonate chimneys and carbonate\ncrusts (shown for Hesperides MV, Fig. 3c). Both, chimneys\nand crusts were ranging in size from several centimetres to\nmetres in length and diametre, respectively. At Faro MV, a\nfew, small patches covered with microbial mats possibly\nconsisting of filamentous sulphide oxidising bacteria were\nFig. 3. Seafloor images (ca. 1 m2) of Capt.

Hesperid\nas shown for Hesperides MV in (c). At Faro mud volcano, also a few dark s\nbacteria were observed (d).\nobserved (Fig. 3d). Moreover, TV-guided grab samples\nrecovered from this MV also contained a few specimens\nof the deep-dwelling chemosynthetic clam Acharax sp. usu-\nally harbouring sulphide oxidising bacteria in their gills\n(Felbeck, 1983; Krueger and Cavanaugh, 1997; Peek\net al., 1998; Sibuet and Olu, 1998). Video observations were\nnot carried out at Gemini MV and the \u2018\u2018No Name\u2019\u2019\nstructure.\n\nThe MUC-cores retrieved from Capt. Arutyunov and\nBonjardim MV contained yellowish, muddy sediments in\nthe top sections from 0 to 20 and 0 to 40 cm bsf, respective-\nly. The bottom sections of the MUC-cores contained mud\nbreccia, a mud matrix with clasts extruded from greater\ndepth below these edifices (Cita et al., 1981; Akhmanov\nand Woodside, 1998). The gravity cores retrieved from\nthese MVs as well as those retrieved from Ginsburg and\nGemini also contained mud breccia. The gravity core\nrecovered from the \u2018\u2018No Name\u2019\u2019 structure contained a ma-\ntrix of cold water coral fragments and greyish mud but no\nmud breccia. Hence, the relation of the \u2018\u2018No Name\u2019\u2019 geo-\nstructure to mud volcanism remains unknown. Grab sam-\nples from Hesperides and Faro MV contained carbonate\nfragments and mud breccia. After recovery, the tempera-\nture in the top sediment section (?1 m) at Bonjardim\nMV was ca. 3 ?C. In contrast, the temperature was consid-\nerably higher at Capt. Arutyunov (12 ?C), Ginsburg MV,\nGemini MV and the \u2018\u2018No Name\u2019\u2019 structure (10 ?C, respec-\ntively) most probably as a result of the warm Mediterra-\nnean outflow water, which contributes to the bottom\nwater at these MVs.\nFaro MV (d). The surface of Capt. Arutyunov, Bonjardim, Ginsburg MV\nrrows of crabs. Some sediment stretches at Capt. Arutyunov MV contained\nes and Faro mud volcano were littered with carbonate chimneys and crusts\nediment patches probably covered with whitish, giant sulphide-oxidizing\n\n\n\n5344 H. Niemann et al. 70 (2006) 5336\u20135355\n3.2. Captain Arutyunov MV\n\n3.2.1. Methane, C2+, sulphate and sulphide\n\nMethane concentrations in surface sediments (0\u201320 cm,\nFig. 4a) were&lt;0.001 mM indicating a complete consump-\ntion of methane rising from deeper sediment strata. A dis-\ntinct SMT was observed in the lower half of the MUC-core\nsection (25\u201340 cm bsf.) with ex situ methane concentrations\nabove saturation at atmospheric pressure, and sulphate\nconcentrations dropping below 0.5 mM. The steepest gra-\ndients of methane and sulphate found in this zone amount-\ned to 0.4 and ?1.12 lmol cm?4, respectively (Fig. 4a, Table\n2). Small gas hydrate chips were found throughout the\nwhole gravity core section from 44 to 235 cm bsf (1941-\n1). Similar to methane, concentrations of C2+-compounds\ndecreased across the SMT (Fig. 4b). Hydrocarbons in the\nsediment comprised methane (>99%), ethane (<0.4%), pro-\npane (<0.07%) with trace amounts of butane and isobutene\npresent indicating a thermogenic origin of these gases\n(Nuzzo et al., 2005; Stadnitskaia et al., 2006 and references\ntherein). Sulphide concentrations peaked in the SMT with\n4.8 mM at 39 cm bsf (Fig. 4d). The steepest sulphide gradi-\nent was 0.63 lmol cm?4 (Fig. 4d, Table 2). A downward\nsulphide gradient could not be determined because highest\nsulphide concentrations were observed in the lowest sedi-\nment horizon of the MUC-core at Capt. Arutyunov MV.\nUnfortunately, the sulphide profile could not be aligned\nwith the gravity core section.\n\n3.2.2. AOM, SR rates and diffusive fluxes\nAOM and SR rates at Capt. Arutyunov MV were high-\n\nest in the SMT at 39 cm bsf with maximum values of 11\nand 25 nmol cm?3 d?1, respectively (Fig. 4c). AOM and\nSR rates sharply decreased above and below this horizon.\nReplicate AOM and SR rate measurements showed a stan-\nFig. 4. Captain Arutyunov mud volcano. A distinct SMT, highlighted in grey,\nhigher hydrocarbons also decline (b). Note that AOM and SR rates (c), sulphid\ndiagnostic, bacterial fatty acids (f) and concentrations of isoprenoidal diethers\nfor methane, sulphate and sulphide (bold lines). Circles represent multiple-core\ndard error of 33% and 37% of the average value, respective-\nly. The areal integration resulted in 1.8 higher SR rates\ncompared to AOM (Table 2). The areal AOM and SR rate\nwere in good agreement with diffusive flux calculations\nshowing a 1.7-fold higher sulphate flux compared to the\nmethane flux. The sulphide flux to the surface (upward\nflux) was comparable to the total downward flux of sul-\nphate (Table 2).\n\n3.2.3. Lipid biomarker\n\nDiagnostic archaeal and bacterial lipid concentrations\nwere strongly increased in sediments at the SMT (Fig. 4e, g).\nHere, stable carbon isotope analysis revealed highest deple-\ntion in 13C with minimum values of ?92&amp; (sn2-hydroxyar-\nchaeol) in archaeal specific diether lipids and ?82&amp;\n(cyC17:0x5,6) in bacterial specific FAs (Table 3, Fig. 4f, g)\nindicating the incorporation of methane derived carbon\nin archaeal and bacterial biomass (sample from 31 cm\nbsf). The concentration of both archaeal and bacterial lip-\nids decreased just above and below this sediment horizon.\nAt the SMT, the ratio of sn2-hydroxyarchaeol relative to\narchaeol was 1.6:1 (Table 3). Other diagnostic archaeal\nisoprenoidal hydrocarbons such as 2,6,11,15-tetramethyl-\nhexadecane (crocetane) could not be quantified due to an\nunresolved complex mixture of hydrocarbons (UCM) in\nall of the hydrocarbon fractions. Similarly, specific archa-\neal diethers and bacterial FAs could not be resolved from\nthis background below 40 cm sediment depth. The concen-\ntrations of diagnostic archaeal lipids were roughly one\norder of magnitude lower in comparison to specific bacte-\nrial FAs.\n\nThe FA fraction in sediments at the SMT was dominat-\ned by the FAs C16:1x5 and cyC17:0x5,6 which are putatively\nspecific for SRB involved in AOM (Elvert et al., 2003) and\ncontained comparably high amounts of the FA C17:1x6\nwas found between 25 and 40 cm bsf (a). At this horizon, concentrations of\ne concentrations (d), concentrations (e) and stable carbon isotope values of\n(g) all peak at the SMT. (a) and (d) illustrate steepest gradients determined\nr and triangles gravity corer samples. Errors are given as standard errors.\n\n\n\nTable 3\nBacterial fatty acids, archaeal diether and isoprenoidal hydrocarbons\nanalysed in sediments at the SMT of Captain Arutyunov and Bonjardim\nMV as well as in carbonate crusts from Hesperides and Faro MV\n\nAbundances of fatty acids were normalised to i-C15:0, archaeal diethers to\narchaeol and archaeal isoprenoidal hydrocarbons to PMI:0. Specific lipid\ncomponents are highlighted in grey.\n\nMud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz 5345\n(Table 3). Both, C16:1x5 and cyC17:0x5,6 were the most\n13C-\n\ndepleted FAs. However, all other FAs in the C14\u2013C17 range\ncarried significantly 13C-depleted isotope signatures as well\nwith values ranging between ?65&amp; (C16:1x9) and ?75&amp;\n(C14:0). C18-FAs were comparably enriched in\n\n13C with\nd13C-values ranging between ?25&amp; (C18:0) and ?31&amp;\n(C18:1x7) most likely indicating a planktonic origin of these\ncompounds. Concentrations of mono- and dialkyl glycerol\nethers (MAGEs and DAGEs, respectively), presumably of\nbacterial origin (Pancost et al., 2001), were low in all sam-\nples recovered during cruise SO-175. Thus, a detailed anal-\nysis of these compounds was not carried out. However,\nsediments at the SMT of Capt. Arutyunov MV comprised\ncomparably high contents of MAGEs relative to DAGES\nwith d13C-values ranging from ?65&amp; to ?85&amp; (data not\nshown). The MAGEs comprised a suite of alkyl moieties,\nwhich is comparable to those of the fatty acids found at\nCapt. Arutyunov MV. The suite of fatty acids extracted\nfrom the tubeworms comprised dominant amounts of the\nFAs C16:1x7 and C18:1x7 and to a lesser degree C16:0 and\nC18:0 with uniform d\n\n13C-values of about ?40&amp;, indicating\nchemoautotrophic carbon fixation (data not shown). The\nalcohol and hydrocarbon fractions were not analysed.\n\n3.2.4. Phylogenetic diversity\n\nAn archaeal and a bacterial clone library was construct-\ned to study the 16S rDNA-based microbial diversity in sed-\niments at the SMT of Capt. Arutyunov MV (30\u201340 cm bsf).\nThe 16S rDNA archaeal clone library consisted of nine\nphylogenetic groups (Table 4). Closest relatives of these\ngroups were found among seep-endemic, uncultured micro-\norganisms. The majority of sequences obtained were relat-\ned to the ANME-2 group (59% ANME-2a, 3% ANME-2c\nof all archaeal sequences) which is known to mediate AOM\n(Boetius et al., 2000; Orphan et al., 2002; Knittel et al.,\n2005). The second most abundant group (18% of all archa-\neal sequences) was found to belong to the ANME-1 cluster\nwhich is also known to mediate AOM (Hinrichs et al.,\n1999; Michaelis et al., 2002; Orphan et al., 2002). The bac-\nterial clone library consisted of 10 uncultivated bacterial\nlineages. Similar to the archaeal sequences, the next rela-\ntives of all bacterial 16S rDNA sequences belonged to\nuncultivated organisms that are commonly found at meth-\nane seeps (Knittel et al., 2003; Table 4). The closest rela-\ntives of the most abundant cluster of sequences (81%)\nbelonged to the Seep-SRB1 group which comprises the\nbacterial partners of ANME-1 and ANME-2 (Knittel\net al., 2003). Other phylogenetic groups of Bacteria were\nrepresented by single sequences (<2%).\n\n3.3. Bonjardim MV\n\n3.3.1. Methane, C2+, sulphate and sulphide\n\nA distinct SMT was observed in the top metre of the\ngravity core section with ex situ methane concentrations\nabove saturation at atmospheric pressure and sulphate\nconcentrations dropping below 0.2 mM. After aligning\nthe sulphate profile of the gravity core with the MUC-\ncore section, the actual depth of the SMT was\ndetermined between 45 and 70 cm bsf (Fig. 5a). Methane\nconcentrations in surface sediments (0\u201352 cm sediment\ndepth) were&lt;0.001 mM indicating a complete consump-\ntion of methane in the SMT. As the two core sections\noverlapped, concentration gradients were determined\nfrom the gravity core section and also from aligned pro-\nfiles in the overlapping zone (Fig. 5a, d). The steepest\nmethane and sulphate gradients in the gravity core sec-\ntion were determined with 0.09 and ?0.76 lmol cm?4,\nrespectively (Fig. 5a, Table 2). Aligning the gravity core\nand MUC-core sections, the steepest sulphate gradient\nwas ?1.67 lmol cm?4. Methane concentrations declined\n\n\n\nTable 4\nArchaeal and bacterial 16S rDNA clone libraries obtained from sediments of the SMT of Captain Arutyunov MV\n\nPhylogenetic group Clones Representative clone Next relative Sequence\nsimilarity (%)\n\nArchaea 39\nEuryarchaeota ANME-2a 23 CAMV300A948 (DQ004662) Uncultured cold seep archaeal clone\n\nBS-K-H6 (AJ578128)\n99\n\nANME-2c 1 CAMV301A975 (DQ004668) Uncultured hydrocarbon seep archaeal\nclone C1_R019 (AF419638)\n\n99\n\nANME-1 7 CAMV300A952 (DQ004664) Uncultured hydrocarbon seep archaeal\nclone HydCal61 (AJ578089)\n\n99\n\nMarine benthic group D 1 CAMV300A963 (DQ004667) Uncultured hydrothermal vent archaeal\nclone pMC2A203 (AB019737)\n\n98\n\nMarine benthic group D 1 CAMV300A951 (DQ004663) Uncultured contaminated aquifer\narchaeal clone WCHD3-02 (AF050616)\n\n90\n\nMarine benthic group D 1 CAMV301A980 (DQ004669) Uncultured hydrothermal vent archaeal\nclone VC2.1 Arc6 (AF068817)\n\n87\n\nUnclassified archaea 1 CAMV300A960 (DQ004666) Uncultured cold seep archaeal clone\nBS-SR-H5 (AJ578148)\n\n98\n\nUnclassified archaea 3 CAMV301A993 (DQ004661) Uncultured hydrothermal vent archaea\nclone NT07-CAT-A24 (AB111475)\n\n80\n\nCrenarchaeota Marine benthic group B 1 CAMV300A958 (DQ004665) Uncultured archaeal clone BS-K-D4\n(AJ578124)\n\n99\n\nBacteria 47\nd Proteobacteria Seep-SRB1 38 CAMV300B922 (DQ004675) Uncultured hydrocarbon seep bacterial\n\nclone Hyd89-04 (AJ535240)\n99\n\nDesulfobulbacteraceae 1 CAMV301B937 (DQ004679) Uncultured Echinocardium cordatum\nhindgut bacterial clone Del 7 (AY845643)\n\n96\n\nDesulfobulbaceae 1 CAMV300B921 (DQ004674) Uncultured hydrocarbon seep bacterial\nclone Hyd89-51 (AJ535252)\n\n99\n\nc Proteobacteria Stenotrophomonas 1 CAMV301B944 (DQ004671) Stenotrophomonas maltophilia\n(AB008509)\n\n99\n\nClostridia Clostridiales 1 CAMV300B902 (DQ004670) Uncultured bacterial clone\nDR9IPCB16SCT8 (AY604055)\n\n98\n\nSpirochaetes Spirochaeta 1 CAMV301B941 (DQ004680) Uncultured Spirochaeta sp.

Niemann et al. 70 (2006) 5336\u20135355\nbelow the depth at which the two core sections overlap\n(Fig. 5a). Hence, no further concentration gradient was\ndetermined. In comparison to Capt. Arutyunov MV,\nC2+-concentrations were high with values of >0.25 mM\nat a sediment depth below 1 m (Fig. 5b). Similar to\nmethane, concentrations of C2+-compounds decreased\nacross the SMT indicating a consumption of these com-\npounds. Gaseous hydrocarbons comprised methane\n(>81%), ethane (<14%), propane (<4.5%) and Rbutane\n(<0.4%) indicating a thermogenic origin of these gases\n(Stadnitskaia et al., 2006). Sulphide concentrations peak-\ned in the SMT with 5.3 mM at 52.5 cm bsf (Fig. 5d). In\nthe gravity core section, the steepest sulphide gradients\nwere determined as 0.23 (upward) and ?0.07 (downward)\nlmol cm?4, respectively (Table 2). Aligning the two core\nsections, the steepest (upward) sulphide gradient was\ndetermined with 0.73 lmol cm?4.\n\n3.3.2. AOM, SR rates and diffusive fluxes\n\nAOM and SR rates were highest in the SMT at 58 cm\nbsf with maximum values of 2.6 and 15.4 nmol cm?3 d?1,\nrespectively (Fig. 5c). Comparably low values of AOM\nand SR rates were measured in over- and underlying sedi-\nment horizons. Replicate AOM and SR rate measurements\nshowed a high standard error of 92% and 85% of the aver-\nage value, respectively, possibly indicating a high small\n\n\n\nFig. 5. Bonjardim mud volcano. A distinct SMT, highlighted in grey, was found between 50 and 70 cm bsf (a). At this horizon, concentrations of higher\nhydrocarbons also decline (b). Note that concentrations of C2+-compounds are ?35-fold higher compared to Captain Arutyunov MV. AOM and SR rates\n(c), sulphide concentrations (d), concentrations (e) and stable carbon isotope values of diagnostic, bacterial fatty acids (f) and concentrations of\nisoprenoidal diethers (g) peak at the SMT. (a) and (d) illustrate steepest gradients determined for methane, sulphate and sulphide (bold lines).\nConcentration gradients for sulphate and sulphide were determined from concentration profiles of the gravity core samples as well as from aligned gravity\ncore and multiple-corer concentration profiles. Circles represent multiple-corer and triangles gravity corer samples. Errors are given as standard errors.\n\nMud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz 5347\nscale variability on a metre scale. The 19-fold higher areal\nSR compared to AOM suggests a decoupling of these two\nprocesses (Table 2). Accordingly, the concentration gradi-\nents (determined from unaligned and aligned profiles)\ntranslate to a 5.1\u201311-fold higher diffusive downward flux\nof sulphate compared to the upward flux of methane.\nThe cumulative sulphide flux (upward and downward)\naccounted for 77\u201392% of the sulphate flux.\n\n3.3.3. Lipid biomarker\n\nA moderate increase of diagnostic archaeal and bacterial\nlipid concentrations was observed at the SMT in sediments\nof Bonjardim MV (Fig. 5e, g). At this horizon (?57 cm\nbsf), stable carbon isotope analysis revealed highest deple-\ntions in 13C with minimum values of ?83&amp; (sn2-hydroxy-\narchaeol) in archaeal diether lipids and ?49&amp; (C16:1x5) in\nbacterial FAs (Table 3, Fig. 5f, g). At the SMT, the ratio\nof sn2-hydroxyarchaeol relative to archaeol was 0.7:1 and\ntherefore lower in comparison to Capt. Arutyunov MV\n(Table 3). Similar to Capt. Arutyunov MV, other diagnos-\ntic archaeal isoprenoidal hydrocarbons could not be mea-\nsured due to a high UCM background. Equally high\namounts of the FAs C16:1x5 and ai-C15:0, both of which\nwere the most 13C-depleted FAs (Table 3), were detected\nin sediments at the SMT. The FA cyC17:0x5,6, which was\nabundant at Capt. Arutyunov MV could not be detected\nin sediments of Bonjardim MV. Furthermore, dominant\nFAs such as C16:1x7, C16:0, C18:1x9 and C18:1x7 carried\nd13C-signatures P?34&amp;, indicating that AOM was not\nthe main energy and carbon delivering process to the\nmicrobial community. In contrast to Capt. Arutyunov\nMV, the concentrations of diagnostic archaeal lipids were\nroughly 4-fold higher compared to specific bacterial FAs\n(Table 3). A further analysis of the diversity of microbial\norganism using 16S rDNA methods was not carried out\nat Bonjardim MV.\n\n3.4. Ginsburg MV, Gemini MV and \u2018\u2018No Name\u2019\u2019\n\n3.4.1. Methane, sulphate and sulphide\n\nThe SMT was located in the upper metre of the sediment\ncores retrieved from Ginsburg and Gemini MV and at\n2\u20133 m bsf at the \u2018\u2018No Name\u2019\u2019 structure, respectively\n(Fig. 6a, c, e). Methane concentrations in sediments overly-\ning the SMT at these structures were&lt;0.001 mM, and\nreached ex situ concentrations above (Gemini MV and\n\u2018\u2018No Name\u2019\u2019) and just below saturation (1.3 mM, Ginsburg\nMV) below the SMT. Sediments retrieved from Ginsburg\nMV had a distinct smell of petroleum below 40 cm bsf.\nNo depth corrections were made as only gravity cores were\ntaken from these MVs. The actual depth of the SMTs was\ntherefore most likely 10\u201340 cm below the sediment depth\nindicated in Fig. 6. In contrast to the observed depletion\nof sulphate to concentrations&lt;0.4 mM below the SMT\nat Gemini MV and the \u2018\u2018No Name\u2019\u2019 structure, sulphate\nconcentrations showed a minimum between 30 and 70 cm\nand an increase to values P17 mM with depth below\n90 cm at Ginsburg MV. The total diffusive sulphate flux\nwas therefore calculated from both, the upward and the\ndownward gradients at Ginsburg MV. At Ginsburg MV,\nGemini MV and the \u2018\u2018No Name\u2019\u2019 structure, methane and\ndownward sulphate gradients ranged from 0.02 to 0.05\nand ?0.11 to ?0.92 lmol cm?4, respectively (Table 2).\nThe upward sulphate gradient at Ginsburg MV was\n0.35 lmol cm?4. Sulphide concentrations peaked in the\nSMTs with values between 4.7 and 7.6 mM (Fig. 6b, d, f)\n\n\n\nFig. 6. The SMT, highlighted in grey, was found in the top most m at Ginsburg (a) and Gemini (c) and between 2 and 3 m at No Name MV (e; note the\ndifferent scale chosen for depth). In these horizons, also sulphide concentrations peak (b, d, f). Bold lines illustrate steepest gradients determined for\nmethane, sulphate and sulphide.\n\n5348 H. Niemann et al. 70 (2006) 5336\u20135355\nand steepest gradients were determined with values be-\ntween 0.04 to 0.32 (upward) and ?0.06 to ?0.15 (down-\nward) lmol cm?4, respectively (Table 2).\n\n3.4.2. Diffusive fluxes\n\nThe diffusive flux calculations from pore water profiles\nof Ginsburg MV, Gemini MV and the \u2018\u2018No Name\u2019\u2019 struc-\nture indicate that the diffusive sulphate fluxes exceeded the\nmethane fluxes (by 15.5-, 18.5- and 2.5-fold, respectively,\naccording to the calculation). This suggests a decoupling\nof AOM and SR at these structures similar to the observa-\ntions made at Bonjardim MV (Table 2). The calculated\ncumulative (upward + downward) sulphide flux accounted\nfor 66%, 70% and 146% of the sulphate fluxes at Ginsburg\nMV, Gemini MV and the \u2018\u2018No Name\u2019\u2019 structure, respec-\ntively. The composition of the microbial community was\nnot investigated here.\n\n3.5. Lipid biomarkers of carbonate crusts\n\nExposed carbonate crusts were observed at the mud vol-\ncanoes Ginsburg, Hesperides and Faro. Additionally, high\namounts of broken carbonate chimneys were found at Hes-\nperides and Faro MV. Both crusts and chimney pieces were\nabsent at Capt. Arutyunov MV, Bonjardim MV and the\n\u2018\u2018No Name\u2019\u2019 structure according to our visual inspections.\nWe could retrieve crust samples from the summits of Hes-\nperides and Faro MV for further analyses of the lipid sig-\nnatures of the crusts.\n\n3.5.1. Hesperides MV\n\nCarbonate crusts of Hesperides MV contained archaeal\nand bacterial lipids diagnostic for methanotrophic commu-\nnities and processes. Archaeal lipids were strongly depleted\nin d13C with minimum values of ?97&amp; (archaeol) whereas\nbacterial FAs were only moderately depleted with mini-\nmum values of ?43&amp; (ai-C15:0, Table 3). Only trace\namounts of sn2-hydroxyarchaeol were detected among\nthe archaeal diethers. Isoprenoidal hydrocarbons were\ndominated by 2,6,10,15,19-pentamethylicosane (PMI:0)\nand contained comparably low amounts of a crocetane/\n2,6,10,14-tetramethylhexadecane (phytane) mixture and\nRPMI:1 (comprising 2 isomers). The FA fraction in the\ncarbonate was dominated by C16:0 followed by C18:0 with\nd13C-values >?28&amp; (Table 3). FAs putatively specific for\nSRB involved in AOM such as C16:1x5, i-C15:0 and ai-\nC15:0 (Elvert et al., 2003; Blumenberg et al., 2004), were\napproximately 3\u20134.8 times lower in concentration com-\npared to C16:0. However, in contrast to abundant FAs, sta-\nble carbon isotope compositions of i-C15:0, ai-C15:0 and\nC16:1x5 showed a moderate depletion in\n\n13C (Table 3).\nMoreover, in comparison to specific archaeal lipids, diag-\nnostic bacterial FAs were roughly an order of magnitude\nlower in concentration.\n\n3.5.2. Faro MV\n\nAll archaeal and bacterial lipids found in the carbonate\ncrust of Faro MV were strongly depleted in 13C (Table 3)\nwith minimum d13C-values of ?114&amp; (archaeol) in diag-\nnostic archaeal diether lipids and ?99&amp; (i-C15:0) in specif-\nic bacterial FAs (Table 3). Archaeal diether lipids were\ndominated by archaeol and contained comparably low\namounts of sn2-hydroxyarchaeol. Isoprenoidal hydrocar-\nbons were dominated by PMI:2 (9 isomers) followed by\nPMI:1 (2 isomers) and relatively high amounts of croce-\ntane/phytane. Specific FAs showed comparably small dif-\nferences in abundance and d13C-values (Table 3).\nHowever, ai-C15:0 was the most dominant FA with a\nroughly 2-fold higher concentration compared to i-C15:0\nand C16:1x5. The FA cyC17:0x5,6 was not detected. Concen-\ntrations of specific FAs were comparable to specific\narchaeal lipids.\n\n\n\nMud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz 5349\n4. Discussion\n\n4.1. Evidence of methane-driven geochemical and biological\n\nactivity at mud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz\n\nActive marine mud volcanoes have been identified as\nimportant escape pathways of hydrocarbon gases and\nmay even contribute to atmospheric green house gases\n(Dimitrov, 2002; Judd et al., 2002; Kopf, 2002; Damm\nand Bude?us, 2003; Dimitrov, 2003; Sauter et al., 2006).\nHowever, high methane fluxes reaching surface sediments\nmay support high biomasses of methane-oxidizing microor-\nganisms, and via their sulphide production also thiotrophic,\ngiant bacteria and other chemosynthetic fauna which form\na filter against gas emission to the hydrosphere (Olu et al.,\n1997b; Sahling et al., 2002; Werne et al., 2002; Boetius\nand Suess, 2004; Milkov et al., 2004; Cordes et al., 2005).\nFurthermore, methane venting is often associated with the\nprecipitation of authigenic carbonates which sequester\nmethane derived CO2 at the seafloor (Aloisi et al., 2000;\nKopf, 2002; Boetius and Suess, 2004; Hensen et al., 2004).\nThese carbonates may also serve as paleo-indicators of pre-\nviously active phases of quiescent or fossil seeps (Ritger\net al., 1987; Peckmann et al., 1999; Thiel et al., 1999).\n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz is characterised by numerous mud\nvolcanoes (Fig. 1) which have been intensely surveyed since\ntheir discovery in 1999 (Kenyon et al., 2000, 2001; Somoza\net al., 2002; Pinheiro et al., 2003). Among the findings\nindicative of high past and present methane seepage are\nthe occurrence of hydrate-bearing sediments, authigenic\ncarbonates and seep related biota at several mud volcanoes\n(Gardner, 2001; Diaz-Del-Rio et al., 2003; Pinheiro et al.,\n2003; Somoza et al., 2003). Yet, the present activity of these\nstructures in relation to methane emission to the hydro-\nsphere remains unknown. The observations during cruise\nSO-175 revealed only few traces of methane reaching sur-\nface sediment horizons (here referring to the upper decime-\ntres bsf reachable by biota) at the centres of the mud\nvolcanoes Capt. Arutyunov, Bonjardim, Ginsburg and\nHesperides, and the \u2018\u2018No Name\u2019\u2019 structure. No visible fluid\nor gas escape to the hydrosphere was detected with video\nobservations, indicating that the mud volcanoes may be\nrelatively inactive and that the methane flux may be con-\nsumed within subsurface sediment horizons. In contrast,\nhighly active seep systems such as Hydrate Ridge, the Gulf\nof Mexico or Ha?kon Mosby Mud Volcano show maximal\nmethane consumption and sulphide production at the sed-\niment surface, and emit methane into the hydrosphere\nthrough focused gas and fluid escape pathways, despite\nthe high methane and sulphate turnover rates consuming\nsubstantial fractions of the methane flux (Boetius et al.,\n2000; Damm and Bude?us, 2003; Treude et al., 2003; Joye\net al., 2004; De Beer et al., 2006; Sauter et al., 2006).\n\nThe high sulphide fluxes from anaerobic methane con-\nsumption at active seeps are utilised by thiotrophic commu-\nnities, e.g. mats of giant bacteria like Beggiatoa sp., various\nchemosynthetic bivalves like Calyptogena sp., Acharax sp.,\nBathymodiolus sp. and by several siboglinid tubeworm spe-\ncies (Sibuet and Olu, 1998). Such communities often colo-\nnise large areas at highly active seeps. Furthermore, these\norganisms are adapted to different geochemical settings\nand can be used as indicators for high methane fluxes and\nturnover in surface sediments. Three types of indicator\ncommunities were so far observed at low abundances at\nthe investigated mud volcanoes. Some small (ca. 20 cm dia-\nmetre) blackish sediment patches covered with white bacte-\nrial mats were observed by towed camera systems at Faro\nMV indicating locally elevated fluxes of sulphide (likely\nAOM-derived) reaching the surface of the seafloor\n(Fig. 6d). Few specimen of the deep-dwelling thiotrophic bi-\nvalve Acharax sp. were recovered from Faro MV and previ-\nously from Ginsburg MV (Gardner, 2001). Members of the\nfamily Solemyidae to which Acharax sp. belongs are mostly\ndeep burrowing and occur in seep habitats with low or mod-\nerate methane and sulphide fluxes where they can take up\nsulphide through their foot from subsurface accumulations\n(Sibuet and Olu, 1998; Sahling et al., 2002; Treude et al.,\n2003). At Hydrate Ridge for instance, Acharax sp. mines\nsubsurface sediments for sulphide pockets below 15 cm sed-\niment depth (Sahling et al., 2002). As a third indicator spe-\ncies, tubeworms were recovered from Capt. Arutyunov and\npreviously observed at Bonjardim MV (Pinheiro et al.,\n2003). As adult animals, these worms are lacking a mouth,\ngut and anus and are hence depending on energy and car-\nbon sources provided by symbiotic, thiotrophic or methan-\notrophic bacteria (Southward et al., 1981; Dando et al.,\n1994; Gebruk et al., 2003; Southward et al., 2005). At Capt.\nArutyunov MV, the moderate 13C-depletion of worm-de-\nrived membrane lipids (ca. ?40&amp;) indicates a thiotrophic\nor mixed methanotrophic/thiotrophic feeding mode of the\ntubeworm symbionts. This is concluded on the basis of\nthe d13C-value of ?48&amp; of the source methane (Nuzzo\net al., 2005). Aerobic methanotrophic bacteria are charac-\nterised by a considerable depletion in the 13C-content of\nmembrane lipids in comparison to source methane (Hanson\nand Hanson, 1996), which was not reflected in the tube-\nworm isotope signature.\n\n4.2. Hotspots of hydrocarbon turnover at the mud volcanoes\n\nof the Gulf of Cadiz\n\nThe observed patterns of seep related biota is in good\nagreement with the observed geochemical gradients. All\nmud volcanoes investigated here showed a complete\ndepletion of methane and sulphate within the subsurface\nSMT. At Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV, the\nSMT was positioned at 25\u201340 cm and 45\u201370 cm bsf,\nrespectively (Figs. 4, 5a), and reflected in elevated AOM\nand SR rates within this zone. Generally, integrated rate\nmeasurements were comparable to the diffusive fluxes at\nCapt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV (Table 3). Also,\nconcentration measurements of methane and sulphate\nand the resulting estimates of diffusive methane and\nsulphate fluxes at Ginsburg MV, Gemini MV and the\n\n\n\n5350 H. Niemann et al. 70 (2006) 5336\u20135355\n\u2018\u2018No Name\u2019\u2019 structure indicate that sulphate-dependent\nAOM is a widespread microbial process in the centres\nof the mud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz. However, as\nwe cannot exclude a potential advective transport compo-\nnent in sediments of the surveyed mud volcanoes and due\nto shortcomings in the vertical resolution of pore water\nprofiles, the estimates of fluxes presented here should be\nconsidered with caution.\n\nWith respect to methane fluxes and microbial turnover\nrates at the time of our investigation, Capt. Arutyunov\nMV was the most active of the investigated structures fol-\nlowed by Bonjardim, Ginsburg and Gemini MV, while\n\u2018\u2018No Name\u2019\u2019 was the least active structure (Table 2). Fur-\nthermore, highest turnover rates and fluxes coincided with\nthe shallowest SMT comparing all investigated MVs.\nHence, compared to other marine gas seeps and methane-\nrich environments, the Gulf of Cadiz MVs investigated\nhere showed a low or medium range in methane turnover\nrates, reflecting the relatively low methane fluxes. At the\nNamibian continental slope, the north western Black Sea\nand Chilean shelf and the western Argentinean basin for in-\nstance, the SMT is located several metres bsf and methane\nfluxes are low with values usually&lt;55 mmol m?2 year?1\n\n(Niewo?hner et al., 1998; J\u00f8rgensen et al., 2001; Hensen\net al., 2003; Treude et al., 2005). These values are compara-\nble to Ginsburg and Gemini MV as well as to the \u2018\u2018No\nName\u2019\u2019 structure. The AOM activity and diffusive methane\nfluxes at Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV were sub-\nstantially higher than those at Ginsburg MV, Gemini\nMV and the \u2018\u2018No Name\u2019\u2019 structure. However, areal rates\nand diffusive fluxes at Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim\nMV are still two orders of magnitude lower in comparison\nto other cold seeps, which bear gas hydrates at their stabil-\nity limit such as Ha?kon Mosby Mud Volcano, Hydrate\nRidge and the Gulf of Mexico. In such environments with\nactive fluid flow (>100 cm year?1) and gas emission via\nebullition, methane fluxes were estimated with values\n>8.5 mol m?2 year?1 (Torres et al., 2002; Luff and Wall-\nmann, 2003; De Beer et al., 2006) and AOM reached values\n>4 mol m?2 year?1, i.e. >0.5 lmol cm?3 d?1 (Treude et al.,\n2003; Joye et al., 2004).\n\nIn vitro experiments with sediment slurries and ex situ\ntracer injection assays have previously shown that AOM\nand SR are in a 1:1 molar stoichiometry if methane is the\nsole carbon source (Nauhaus et al., 2002; Treude et al.,\n2003). In spite of the putative loss of methane during sub-\nsampling, the deviation from the 1:1 stoichiometry between\nAOM and SR as well as between the sulphate and methane\nfluxes (Table 2) indicates the presence of electron donors\nother than methane for SR at the investigated MVs. SRR\nwere always highest at the depth of the SMT but just above\ndetection limit in the overlying sediments of Capt. Arutyu-\nnov and Bonjardim MV (Figs. 4, 5c). Hence, a substantial\ncontribution to SR by pelagic organic matter input can be\nruled out. However, our data provide evidence for the pres-\nence of other hydrocarbons beside methane in the subsur-\nface sediments of several mud volcanoes. Sulphate\nreducing bacteria can use a variety of short and long chain\nalkanes and complex aliphatic and aromatic compounds\n(Rueter et al., 1994; Widdel and Rabus, 2001). At Capt.\nArutyunov and Bonjardim MV the presence of complex\nhydrocarbons is indicated by the strong unresolved com-\nplex mixture (UCM) of hydrocarbons in sediment samples\nfrom the SMT and deeper sediment horizons. Further-\nmore, C2\u2013C4 compounds declined at the depth of the\nSMT (Figs. 4, 5b), indicating their consumption in this\nzone. At Bonjardim MV, the deviation between AOM\nand SR was higher compared to Capt. Arutyunov MV\ncoinciding with higher concentrations of C2+ compounds.\nFurthermore, Mazurenko et al. (2002) observed a compo-\nsition of hydrocarbon gases at Ginsburg MV similar to\nthose detected at Bonjardim MV. Nuzzo et al. (2005) and\nStadnitskaia et al. (2006) showed that methane is common-\nly of a thermogenic origin at mud volcanoes in the Gulf of\nCadiz. Hence, SR fuelled by higher hydrocarbons could be\nan important microbial process in the MV sediments of the\nGulf of Cadiz in addition to methane oxidation. Similar re-\nsults were obtained in a study of cold seeps of the Gulf of\nMexico where SR rates exceed AOM rates up to 10-fold,\nfuelled by a variety of hydrocarbons and petroleum in\nthe sediments (Joye et al., 2004).\n\nIn conclusion, our biogeochemical measurements as well\nas biological and geological observations indicate that ele-\nvated methane fluxes are associated with the centres of the\nMVs studied during cruise SO-175. However, at the inves-\ntigated sites, all methane was consumed anaerobically in\nsubsurface sediments and we could not observe any emis-\nsion of methane to the hydrosphere. However, there is evi-\ndence for extensive fluid and/or gas escape in the past as\nindicated by the widespread occurrence of massive carbon-\nate chimneys and crusts (Diaz-Del-Rio et al., 2003; Somoza\net al., 2003) of which at least the latter bear AOM signals.\nAnother geological evidence for temporally varying activi-\nties of mud volcanism in the Gulf of Cadiz are the typical\n\u2018\u2018Christmas tree\u2019\u2019 structures observed on high-resolution\nseismic profiles (Somoza et al., 2002, 2003). Such patterns\nare probably caused by eruptive events followed by phases\nof dormancy. This so-called multiphase activity is a com-\nmon behaviour in many terrestrial mud volcanoes (e.g.\nLokbatan MV; Aliyev et al., 2002; Kholodov, 2002; Dim-\nitrov, 2003). It is therefore possible that mud volcanism\nin the Gulf of Cadiz is in a transient state of low activity\nat present.\n\n4.3. Identity of methane oxidising communities in sediments\n\nand carbonate crusts\n\nFingerprinting of diagnostic lipids is a common tool for\nthe chemotaxonomic identification of microorganisms\n(Madigan et al., 2000; Boschker and Middelburg, 2002).\nThis approach has been used extensively to examine anaer-\nobic methanotrophic organisms, because the carbon iso-\ntope fractionation associated with AOM leads to specific,\nvery depleted d13C-signatures of lipid biomarkers (Hinrichs\n\n\n\nMud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz 5351\net al., 1999; Elvert et al., 2001; Blumenberg et al., 2004).\nThe dominance of bacterial and archaeal lipids with low\nd13C-values in sediments and carbonates indicate that\nAOM is a major biomass-generating process at the investi-\ngated MVs. Differences in the abundances of specific archa-\neal isoprenoidal diethers, hydrocarbons and bacterial FAs,\nas well as varying Dd13C-values of these lipids (compared\nto source methane) indicate that several phylogenetic\ngroups of methanotrophic communities mediate AOM in\nthe Gulf of Cadiz. Elevated concentrations and associated\nlow d13C-signatures of specific archaeal and bacterial mem-\nbrane lipids corresponded with elevated AOM and SR\nrates in sediments of the SMT at Capt. Arutyunov and\nBonjardim MV (Figs. 4, 5e\u2013g, Table 3). In combination\nwith 16S rDNA analysis, the biomarker patterns give evi-\ndence that AOM is mediated by a microbial community\nconsisting of methanotrophic archaea and SRB phyloge-\nnetically related to those which were previously found at\nother methane seeps (Boetius et al., 2000; Michaelis\net al., 2002; Orphan et al., 2002; Teske et al., 2002; Nie-\nmann et al., 2005). Furthermore, the presence of a similar\nsuite of 13C-depleted lipids in abundant authigenic carbon-\nates recovered from Hesperides and Faro MV (Table 3)\nindicates higher activities and a more widespread microbial\nmethane turnover in the past.\n\n4.3.1. Methanotrophic archaea\n\nPrevious publications revealed dominant amounts of\nsn2-hydroxarchaeol relative to archaeol in ANME-2 dom-\ninated habitats, whereas the reverse was observed in\nANME-1 dominated systems (Blumenberg et al., 2004; El-\nvert et al., 2005; Niemann et al., 2005). Moreover, ANME-\n2 communities were found to comprise high contents of\ncrocetane, whereas it seems to be present at low concentra-\ntions in ANME-1 (Elvert et al., 1999; Boetius et al., 2000;\nBlumenberg et al., 2004). Stable carbon isotope fractiona-\ntions were found to be higher in ANME-2 compared to\nANME-1 dominated habitats (Orphan et al., 2002) with\nDd13C-values (archaeol relative to the source methane)\nranging between 34 to 53&amp; and 11 to 37&amp;, respectively\n(Hinrichs et al., 1999; Boetius et al., 2000; Elvert et al.,\n2001; Orphan et al., 2002; Teske et al., 2002; Blumenberg\net al., 2004; Niemann et al., 2005).\n\nIn the Gulf of Cadiz, a high sn2-hydroxyarchaeol to\narchaeol ratio of 1.7:1 was detected at Capt. Arutyunov\nMV indicating that this system is dominated by ANME-2\narchaea (Blumenberg et al., 2004; Elvert et al., 2005).\nAccordingly, a high Dd13C-value of 42&amp; of archaeol com-\npared to the source methane (?48&amp;, Nuzzo et al., 2005)\nwas observed. Furthermore, the dominance of ANME-2\ncompared to ANME-1 sequences in the clone library from\nCapt. Arutyunov MV suggests a dominance of ANME-2 in\nthis SMT. However, the SMT of Capt. Arutyunov MV also\ncontained other typical seep associated 16S rDNA\nsequences, including crenarcheota of the Marine Benthic\nGroup B, which are often found at methane seeps, but\nwhose function remains unknown (Knittel et al., 2005).\nAt Bonjardim MV, a lower sn2-hydroxyarchaeol to archae-\nol ratio of 0.7:1 combined with lower Dd13C-values be-\ntween the biomarkers (e.g. archaeol, 31.5&amp;) relative to\nthe source methane (?49.5 to ?51&amp;, Nuzzo et al., 2005;\nStadnitskaia et al., 2006) lie between published values from\nsystems dominated by either ANME-1 or ANME-2 (Blu-\nmenberg et al., 2004; Elvert et al., 2005; Niemann et al.,\n2005). This suggests a mixed ANME community in these\nsediments. Similar characteristics have been observed in\ncarbonate crusts at Faro MV. At this mud volcano, sub-\nstantial amounts of 13C-depleted crocetane were detected\ngiving additional indications for an involvement of\nANME-2 in AOM at the time of carbonate precipitation.\nAt Hesperides MV, only trace amounts of sn2-hydroxyar-\nchaeol were detected, and thus indicate the dominance of\nANME-1 communities. No distinct environmental prefer-\nences have been found for either group, most likely because\nthe taxonomic level investigated comprises a relatively\nlarge diversity of microorganisms.\n\n4.3.2. Sulphate reducing bacteria\n\nAt many different cold seep settings, ANME-1 and\nANME-2 archaea have been found in consortium with\nSRB of the Seep-SRB1 cluster belonging to the Desulfosar-\ncina/Desulfococcus group (Knittel et al., 2003). However,\nthis cluster apparently comprises physiologically different\necotypes that are distinguished by very specific FA patterns\naccording to their association to either ANME-1 or to\nANME-2 (Elvert et al., 2003; Blumenberg et al., 2004).\nFA signatures in environmental systems dominated by\nANME-1/Seep-SRB1 communities comprise high contents\nof ai-C15:0 relative to i-C15:0 (Blumenberg et al., 2004; El-\nvert et al., 2005), whereas systems dominated by ANME-\n2/Seep-SRB1 communities comprise the unusual FA\ncyC17:1x5,6 and dominant contents of C16:1x5 but almost\nbalanced ratios of ai-C15:0 relative to i-C15:0 (Elvert et al.,\n2003; Blumenberg et al., 2004).\n\nThe dominance of the unusual FAs C16:1x5 and\ncyC17:1x5,6 and an almost equal ratio of the iso- and ante-\niso-branched C15:0 FAs in sediments of the SMT at Capt.\nArutyunov MV are in very good agreement with the archa-\neal lipid data and published lipid signatures of the Seep-\nSRB1 ecotype associated with ANME-2. This finding is\nalso in accordance with the predominance of Seep-SRB1\nsequences in the bacterial clone library. As expected from\nthe detection of potentially diverse ANME communities\nat Bonjardim MV, the FA signature shows characteristics\nof both SRB ecotypes previously identified as bacterial\npartners in AOM. The high ratio of ai-C15:0 compared to\ni-C15:0 (8.4:1) is indicative for the Seep-SRB1 ecotype asso-\nciated with ANME-1 while the high abundance of C16:1x5\nindicates the ecotype associated with ANME-2. This find-\ning is similar to results obtained from a carbonate crust\nat Faro MV where a comparable fatty acid pattern has\nbeen detected. At Bonjardim MV, however, several FAs\ncarry d13C-signatures that are comparable to the source\nmethane and do not show any fractionation. This suggests\n\n\n\n5352 H. Niemann et al. 70 (2006) 5336\u20135355\na contribution to carbon biomass from processes other\nthan methane consumption. A similar mixture of carbon\nsources to biomass could also explain the unspecific signa-\nture of FAs in the carbonate of Hesperides MV.\n\nAnother striking difference is the comparably high lipid\nconcentration in the carbonate recovered from Faro com-\npared to that recovered from Hesperides MV. A rather re-\ncent formation of the sampled carbonate from Faro MV\nappears likely, as these were stained black from sulphide\nand recovered together with some living specimens of the\nchemosynthetic bivalve Acharax sp. A possible explanation\nfor the difference in AOM-derived lipid contents could be\nthat the sampled carbonate crust from Hesperides is older\nthan that recovered from Faro MV and has been exposed\nto oxic sea water and lipid diagenesis for a longer time\nwhich is indicated by the dominant abundance of saturated\nFAs relative to unsaturated FAs. This may also explain the\ndominance of PMI\u2019s with higher degrees of saturation at\nHesperides compared to Faro MV assuming that the diage-\nnetic alteration of unsaturated isoprenoid hydrocarbons is\nsimilar to that of FAs.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nAt the centres of the mud volcanoes Captain Arutyu-\nnov, Bonjardim, Ginsburg, Gemini and Faro as well as\nat the \u2018\u2018No Name\u2019\u2019 structure, several indications for a slow\nupward fluid and gas flux were found. Our data suggest a\ncomplete consumption of methane and higher hydrocar-\nbons in the sediments of the studied mud volcanoes at\ndepths of 20\u2013300 cm below seafloor. We found no indica-\ntion of hydrocarbons reaching near surface sediments or\nthe hydrosphere except from the visual observation of\nsmall patches of reduced sediments covered by giant sul-\nphide-oxidizing bacteria indicating localised near-surface\nAOM activities. However, with respect to the limited ex-\ntend of video surveys and sediment sampling in this study,\na potential seepage of hydrocarbons into the water column\ncan not be ruled out. The overlap of methane and sulphate\ndepletion with sulphide production shows that methane\noxidation processes are mediated microbially under anaer-\nobic conditions. Correspondingly, AOM and SR rates\nshow a peak in a distinct, narrow SMT in the subsurface\nsediments of the mud volcano centres. Highest turnover\nrates and fluxes coincided with the shallowest SMT depths\nwith Capt. Arutyunov MV as the most active system in the\nstudy area, followed by the mud volcanoes Bonjardim,\nGinsburg and Gemini, and finally the \u2018\u2018No Name\u2019\u2019 struc-\nture. In comparison to other gas seeps, methane fluxes\nand turnover rates are low to mid range in the Gulf of Ca-\ndiz. In addition to AOM, the anaerobic oxidation of higher\nhydrocarbons could be an important process fuelling SR.\nLipid biomarker patterns and 16S rDNA clone sequences\nfrom the sediments and carbonates of the AOM hotspots\nprovide evidence that both of the previously described\nANME-1/Seep-SRB1 and ANME-2/Seep-SRB1 communi-\nties mediate AOM at mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz.\nThe finding of their lipid signatures in carbonate crusts at\nthe centres of the investigated mud volcanoes indicates that\nat least some of the vast amounts of carbonates littering\nmud volcanoes and diapiric ridges in the northern part of\nthe Gulf of Cadiz are linked to methane seepage.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank the captain and crew as well as the\nshipboard scientific community of the R/V SONNE for\ntheir help at sea.

The investigation of six active sites shows that mud volcano (MV) fluids, on average, are highly enriched\nin CH4, Li, B, and Sr and depleted in Mg, K, and Br. The purity of the fluids is largely controlled by the intensity of upward directed\nflow. Flow rates could be constrained by numerical modelling and vary between&lt;0.05 and 15 cm yr?1. Application of dD\u2013d18O system-\natics identifies clay mineral dehydration, most likely within Mesozoic and Tertiary shales and marls, as the major source of fluids. Hence,\nCl and Na in the pore fluids are mostly depleted below seawater values, following a general trend of dilution. However, deviations from\nthis trend occur and are likely caused by the dissolution of halite in evaporitic deposits. Other secondary processes overprinting the ori-\nginal fluid composition may occur along the flow path, such as dissolution of anhydrite or gypsum and/or the formation of calcite and\ndolomite. Different sources of fluids are also indicated by variations in 87Sr/86Sr, which range from 0.7086 to 0.7099 at the different sites.\nDehydration may be induced primarily by overburden and tectonic compression; however, very high concentrations of Li and B, spe-\ncifically at Captain Arutyunov MV (CAMV) indicate additional leaching at temperatures above 150 ?C, which could be explained by the\ninjection of hot fluids along deep penetrating, major E\u2013W strike\u2013slip fault systems. This hypothesis is supported by the occurrence of\ngenerally thermogenic, but significantly CH4-enriched, light volatile hydrocarbon gases at CAMV which cannot be explained by shallow\nmicrobial methanogenesis. Li and Li/B ratios from different types of hot and cold vents are used to infer that high temperature signals\nseem to be preserved at various cold vent locations and indicate a closer coupling of both systems in continental margin environments\nthan outlined in previous studies.\n? 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc.\nC\n\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\nU\nN1.

Negative chloride anomalies are typically\nreported from many modern accretionary prisms (Moore\nand Vrolijk, 1992); however, depending on the geologic\nand structural setting, the overlap of a number of these\nprocesses may lead to the formation of geochemically dis-\ntinct fluids with an eventually complex history.

The\nNE sector is marked by a conjugate set of NW\u2013SE and\nNE\u2013SW strike\u2013slip faults (Fig. 1) that control diapiric ridg-\nes and together with major WNW\u2013ESE strike\u2013slip faults\nare thought to accommodate the NW-directed plate con-\nvergence (e.g. Argus et al., 1989; Pinheiro et al., 2005) in\na broad deformation zone (Morel and Meghraoui, 1996)\nthat has been described as a diffuse plate boundary (Sartori\net al., 1994). It has been proposed previously that plate\nconvergence in the region is accommodated along major\ndeeply rooted Paleozoic wrench faults reactivated under\nPlio-Quaternary transpressive convergence (Meghraoui\net al., 1996; Morel and Meghraoui, 1996). The formation\nof the Arc of Gibraltar and expulsion of thick nappes to\nthe west in the Gulf of Cadiz were initiated by a change\nin the main convergence direction during the Mid- to\nUpper-Miocene (Maldonado et al., 1999). Several studies\nhave suggested that westward progression of the Arc of\nGibraltar into the Gulf of Cadiz ceased before the Pliocene\n(e.g. Lonergan and White, 1997; Maldonado et al., 1999),\nhowever, Gutscher et al. (2002) and Gutscher (2004) pro-\nposed that E\u2013W subduction remains active and is driven\nby the rollback of a relic of subducted Thethian oceanic\ncrust beneath the Arc of Gibraltar (Fig. 1).\n\nMud volcanoes (MVs) were first discovered and sampled\nin the Gulf of Cadiz in 1999 (Gardner, 2001) and since then\nhave been extensively investigated during several research\ncruises (Pinheiro et al., 2003, 2005). Folding, mud volca-\nnism, and diapirism in the region result from neo-tectonism\n(Gra?cia et al., 2003) and MVs are located either along ma-\njor strike\u2013slip faults or at the intersection of these faults\nwith arcuate thrusts associated with the formation of the\nGibraltar Arc (Pinheiro et al., 2003, 2005).\n\n3.

The\ncores were segmented in pieces of 1 m and cut lengthwise\nin a cooled laboratory at about 6 ?C. Sediment samples\nfor pore water and gas analyses were collected within\n1\u20132 h after retrieval. Although it is a well-known fact\nthat most (up to 95%) of the light hydrocarbon gases\nare lost during core recovery, the remaining methane is\nhighly enriched above background values and can be\nused for reliable flux calculations (Niewo?hner et al.,\n1998) and isotope analyses (Wallace et al., 2000). Pore\nwaters were squeezed using a pressure filtration system\nat pressures up to 5 bar and filtered through 0.45 lm cel-\nlulose acetate membrane filters. Pore water samples were\nthen immediately analysed onboard or sub-sampled for\nsubsequent analysis. Sediment samples for pore water\nhydrocarbon gas analysis were extruded and disaggregat-\ned in sealed 35 ml vials containing 10 ml of a 10%-KCl\nsolution to stop all microbial activity (Bowes and Horn-\nibrook, 2006).\n\n3.2.

Geochemical modelling\n\nRates of upward fluid flow, pore water mixing and\nAOM were determined by applying a reactive transport\nmodel running on Mathematica? Version 5.0 (Schmidt\net al., 2005). The model considers molecular diffusion and\nadvection of dissolved SO4, CH4, Cl, and B. We applied\nthe general differential equation:\n\n/ ?\no\u00bdC?\not\n\u00bc o\n\n/ ?

Discussion\n\n5.1. Fluid advection and mixing processes\n\nThe purity of the geochemical signature of the pore\nwater is dependent on the overall advection rate of the\nupward migrating fluid and irrigation processes in the\nsubsurface sediments. In order to derive quantitatively\nwell-constrained estimates of the advection rate we per-\nformed numerical model runs with conservative (Cl, B)\nand reacting parameters (SO4, CH4). Under environmental\nconditions met in the uppermost surface layers, Cl and B\ncan be considered as geochemically conservative and hence\ntheir depth profiles provide useful parameters to estimate\nupward rates of fluid flow (Martin et al., 1996; Aloisi\net al., 2004a; Haese et al., 2006). The consistency of flux\nrates can be checked by simultaneously modelling reactive\nsolutes (e.g., SO4 and CH4). In addition, the transition zone\nof SO4 and CH4 (AOM; Fig. 2a) is a perfect measure of the\ndepth of near-surface mixing and oxidation processes in the\nvicinity of a vent site. A more detailed discussion of AOM\nat Gulf of Cadiz MVs is given in (Niemann et al., 2006).\n\nAll model parameters used to produce the fitted curves\nshown in Fig. 5 are summarized in Table 4. In general,\ngood and internally consistent curve fits for Cl, B, and\nSO4 could be produced for all sites. The scatter in Cl-pro-\nfiles below 50 cm bsf at CAMV is attributed to the occur-\nrence of gas hydrate at this site, and hence the maximum\nCl-concentration measured in each of the cores has been\nused as the lower boundary (maximum) concentration in\nthe model. In these cases, B is a more reliable parameter be-\ncause pore water concentrations are less affected by the\npresence of gas hydrates due to the high concentration dif-\nference between seawater and MV pore fluid.

As outlined above (Section 3.1), the large dis-\ncrepancy between measured and modelled concentrations\nis due to the significant decrease of methane solubility\nand degassing during core recovery. Hence, the MV fluids\nare probably saturated with CH4 at all sites, except at Hes-\nperides and No Name MVs, where upward fluid flow rates\nare low and SO4 penetrates deeply into the sediment so that\nsaturation levels of dissolved CH4 cannot be expected with-\nin the core depth.\n\nShallow near-surface gradients of all solutes are ex-\nplained by active admixing of bottom water, which seems\nPlease cite this article in press as: Hensen, C. et al., Sources of mud\nCosmochim.

Due to the elevat-\ned advective flow velocities, the mixing zone is very thin in\nthe CAMV cores and only resolved by multicorer sampling\n(Niemann et al., 2006). Overall, flux rates decrease from\nCAMV to Hesperides MV in the order listed in Table 4\n(from left to right).

We suspect that high SO4\nlevels are caused by dissolution of anhydrite or gypsum\nat greater depth (see also Section 5.2.2). In contrast to\nGinsburg MV (GeoB9061-1), the very slight increase of sul-\nphate at CAMV (GeoB 9072-1) can be readily attributed to\na&lt;10% admixing of seawater as it is accompanied by a\nsimilar increase of K and Mg and an obvious decrease of\nBa-levels (Fig. 2). These hypotheses are further substantiat-\ned by the calculation of saturation levels (X) for barite\n(using average Ba and SO4 concentrations of the cores\n9072-1 and 9061-1 below the AOM and the solubility con-\nstant for barite in seawater provided by (Aloisi et al.,\n2004b) which indicate highly supersaturated fluids at\nCAMV (X > 3) and undersaturated fluids (X &lt;0.5) at\nGinsburg MV. Since precipitation kinetics of barite are rel-\natively slow (Aloisi et al., 2004b) supersaturation is indica-\ntive of a non-equilibrated system (recent seawater admixing\ninto Ba-rich fluid) whereas the undersaturated fluids may\nhave had sufficient time for equilibration due to the deep\nsource of SO4.\n\n5.2. Origin of the fluids\n\n5.2.1. Evidence for clay mineral dehydration\n\nAs demonstrated by numerical modelling, the most ac-\ntive sites of fluid advection are GeoB 9041-1 and 9072-1\nlocated at CAMV. The compilation dD and d18O values\nof pore water samples from all investigated sites (Fig. 3) re-\nveals a clear negative correlation which is typical for water\nthat has been released by clay mineral dehydration, most\nlikely by the transformation of smectite to illite (Sheppard\nand Gilg, 1996; Da?hlmann and De Lange, 2003). This\nobservation is in accordance with data from Mediterranean\nRidge mud volcanoes (Fig. 3) and earlier observations at\nYuma and Ginsburg MVs in the Gulf of Cadiz (Mazur-\nenko et al., 2003), although interpreted differently by the\nlatter authors. The major temperature field for this process\nranges between 60 and 150 ?C (Freed and Peacor, 1989;\nChan and Kastner, 2000). Applying an average geothermal\ngradient of 30 ?C per km, the upper limit of formation\ndepth would be approximately 5 km bsf, which comprises\nthe lower sedimentary units deposited on basement rocks\n(Medialdea et al., 2004).\n\nDue to the complex stratigraphic and tectonic develop-\nment in this area it is difficult to unambiguously identify\nthe \u2018\u2018source rocks\u2019\u2019.

An abundance of smectite has been\nreported in sediments affected by terrigeneous input\n(Chamley, 1989; Reicherter and Pletsch, 2000). However,\nthe clear stable isotopes signal (Fig. 3) strongly suggests\nthat the release of freshwater at greater depth is the quan-\ntitatively dominant process of fluid formation in this area.\nThe upward migration of the overpressured fluids occurs\nunder tectonic control, causing the liquefaction of sedi-\nments and the formation of mud volcanoes, which appear\nto be located along deep strike\u2013slip faults and thrusts, or\nat fault intersections (Pinheiro et al., 2005; Fig. 1).\n\n5.2.2. Overprinting of the fluid signature by secondary\n\nprocesses\n\nIn principle, the release of mineral-bound water results\nin a general freshening of pore fluids reflected by decreased\nconcentrations of Na and Cl, and other major solutes\n(Fig. 2). Such a dilution trend is also depicted in Fig. 6.\nHowever, deviations from the mixing line between seawater\nand fluid suggest the occurrence of additional processes\nleading to coeval and subsequent overprinting of the fluid\ncomposition. Whereas Na is relatively enriched with re-\nspect to Cl, Mg, and K are considerably depleted. Similar\nobservations have been reported from mud volcano sites\nat different continental margins around the world (Martin\net al., 1996; Aloisi et al., 2004a; Godon et al., 2004).\n\nRelative Na enrichments over Cl are thought to be a di-\nrect consequence of the transformation of smectite to illite\nU\nN\n\nC\nO\n\nR\nR\n\nE\nC\n\nT\n\nFig. 6.

The increase in Na is then\na simple function of the relative amount of Na to H2O in the\nsmectite. This, however, is difficult to estimate since the Na\u2013\nH2O ratio of natural smectites is a quite variable factor.\nConsidering, for the moment, only those sites where the\npore water chlorinity indicates freshening, there is a clear\ntrend in Na increase in the order: No Name MV (?seawater\ndilution) &lt;Bonjardim MV &lt;Gemini MV &lt;Ginsburg MV.\nIn simple terms, this would mean that the Na content in the\noriginal smectite would have shown an increase in the same\norder of sites. This relation is more clearly illustrated in\nFig. 7. Assuming that the observed dilutions with respect\nto seawater are caused by \u2018\u2018dissolution\u2019\u2019 of a typical smectite\n(montmorillonite) containing 15 wt% of water (Sheppard\nand Gilg, 1996), the relative amount of Na in the smectites\ncan be calculated by matching the observed endmember\nconcentration in each core. In the same order of MVs as giv-\nen above this would be 0.004, 0.007, 0.028, and 0.12 mol Na\nper mol of smectite.\n\nSpecifically for Ginsburg MV these observations are,\nhowever, inconsistent with isotope data (Fig. 3) and mod-\nelled advection rates (Fig. 5 and Table 4) as, in theory, the\ndegree of freshening should be in accordance with the iso-\ntope signal and with the rate of fluid flow. Hence, this obvi-\nous contradiction at Ginsburg MV suggests that other\nprocesses release Na into solution, preferentially without\naltering the isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen.\n\nThe incongruent dissolution of Na-feldspars (albite to\nkaolinite; Eq.

In\ncontrast to the sites exhibiting pore water freshening, fluids\nfrom Captain Arutyunov are enriched in both Na and Cl\n(Fig. 7) and the approximately constant Na/Cl ratio of 1\nat CAMV indicates the dissolution of halite (e.g. Bernas-\nconi, 1999). However, typical brines resulting from leach-\ning of halite usually exhibit much higher concentrations\nof NaCl. This implies that the measured concentration of\n600 mM can only be explained by a mild leaching of NaCl.\nAdding some NaCl to seawater would, however, not yield a\nfluid with a Na/Cl ratio of 1. Taking into account that this\nsite exhibits the highest advection rates in combination\nwith the clearest dD and d18O signal of all sites within\nthe study area, we may conclude that a strongly freshened\nfluid is dissolving halite at depth. For such a low salinity\nfluid only slight additions of Na released during clay min-\neral transformation are needed in order to shift the NaCl\nratio from 0.87 (in seawater) to about 1. In the same\nway, the opposite trends at Ginsburg MV (Cl-depletion\nand Na-enrichment) can be sufficiently explained, by sim-\nply leaching less NaCl by a freshened, but slightly more\nNa-enriched original fluid. In order to obtain an approxi-\nmation to the original Cl concentration at Ginsburg MV\nand CAMV we used the obvious relation between Cl and\nd18O at those sites, which are not affected by halite dissolu-\ntion.

As outlined in\nSection 5.1, elevated pore water SO4 concentrations at Gin-\nburg MV most likely result from leaching of gypsiferous\nclays and brecciae that generally cap deposition centres in\nthe Gharb Basin (Maestro et al., 2003; Medialdea et al.,\n2004).\n\nIn contrast, slightly decreasing Na/Cl ratios at Hesperi-\ndes MV (Fig. 7) may indicate evaporated seawater or resid-\nual brines as a potential source in Hesperides MV (e.g.\n(McCaffrey et al., 1987). However, low advection rates at\nHesperides MV cause a weak geochemical signal and\nhence, this interpretation is more speculative and will not\nbe discussed in more detail.\n\nMg and K are strongly depleted in pore fluids at all sites\n(with the exception of K in No Name MV fluids; Fig. 6). In\nprinciple, the level of depletion is a function of advection\nrates, where the greatest advection produces the largest\ncomposition offset from seawater. The most likely explana-\ntion for the K-depletion in MV fluids is its integration into\nillite during clay mineral transformation (Martin et al.,\n1996; Aloisi et al., 2004a; Godon et al., 2004). Moreover,\nK is considered to be a major factor controlling the kinetics\nof smectite to illite transformation and the lack of K may\neven cause incomplete reaction (Spinelli and Underwood,\n2004; Cuadros, 2006). This case is strengthened by the\nstrong correlation of K with either increasing d18O, as\ndepicted in Fig. 9, or with decreasing dD. In contrast, there\nis no correlation between Na and d18O\u2013H2O values result-\ning from dissolution of halite affecting Na and Cl levels in\npore water as outlined above.\nU\nN\n\nC\nO\n\nR 675676\n677\n678\n679\n680\n681\n682\n683\n684\n685\n686\n687\n688\n689\n690\n691\n692\n693\n694\n\nFig. 9.

Although calcium carbonate precipitation\nrelated to AOM can be assumed, Ca-depletion below the\nAOM zone is typical for all sites. Hence, low Ca concentra-\ntions controlled by high levels of alkalinity (generated by\norganic matter breakdown and submarine weathering pro-\ncesses) are an inherent feature of the upward migrating flu-\nids before reaching the surface sediments. The slight\ncurvature of the Mg concentration depth profile (Fig. 2)\nor in the Mg vs. Cl plot shown in Fig. 6 does indicate the\noccurrence of co-precipitation of authigenic Mg-calcite\nrelated to AOM, although low Mg-levels are most proba-\nbly largely controlled by the dolomitisation of widespread\nTertiary and Mesozoic carbonates (Maldonado et al.,\n1999; Medialdea et al., 2004) deeper within the mud\nvolcanoes.\n\n5.2.3. High temperature imprint in the fluid signature\n\nThe most obvious enrichments observed are those in B,\nLi, and Sr (Figs. 2 and 6). B- and Li-enriched fluids are\nwell-known from numerous locations along active conti-\nnental margins worldwide (You et al., 1993; Martin\net al., 1996; Chan and Kastner, 2000; Haese et al., 2003;\nAloisi et al., 2004a; Hensen et al., 2004) and may be pri-\nmarily released from clay minerals (Brumsack and Zuleger,\n1992). Under experimental conditions simulating hydro-\nthermal alteration of hemipelagic sediments Li is enriched\npreferentially over B as temperatures increase above\n150 ?C (You et al., 1995; Chan et al., 1999; You and Gies-\nkes, 2001). The B/Li ratio in the Gulf of Cadiz fluids is con-\nsistently >10; however, Li concentrations as high as\n700 lM and B abundances up to 15 mM are amongst the\nhighest levels reported to date from offshore cold seep envi-\nronments (Aloisi et al., 2004a; Godon et al., 2004; Haese\net al., 2006). Hence, the low ratios instead may be caused\nby different mechanisms of Li and B release or different\nsource-rock potentials, rather than being an indicator of\nlow temperature alteration. For comparison, vent fluids\nat the convergent margin off Costa Rica are thought to\nbe derived from sources having temperatures up to\n150 ?C; here, only B, but no Li enrichments were detected\n(Hensen et al., 2004). Similar results are reported from\nfreshened mud volcano fluids of the Mediterranean Ridge\n(De Lange and Brumsack, 1998; Haese et al., 2006; Haese,\npersonal communication). In contrast, fluids detected\nalong distinct fault zones at ODP site 1040 at the Costa\nRica margin (Chan and Kastner, 2000) are similar in com-\nposition to the vent fluids but are enriched in Li up to\n300 mM. This finding rather suggests that deep and shal-\nlow fluid systems at the Costa Rica convergent margin\nare less well connected and the transmission of any original\nhigh temperature signal may be affected by the amount of\nmixing with other fluids and various reactions occurring\nalong the flow path. However, following the results of\n(You and Gieskes, 2001), we propose that Li-enrich-\nments\u2014at least above certain threshold value\u2014are indica-\nvolcano fluids in the Gulf of Cadiz\u2014indications ..., Geochim.\n\n\n\nT\n\n695\n696\n697\n698\n699\n700\n701\n702\n703\n704\n705\n706\n707\n708\n709\n710\n711\n712\n713\n714\n715\n716\n717\n718\n719\n720\n721\n722\n723\n724\n725\n726\n727\n\n728\n729\n730\n731\n732\n733\n734\n735\n736\n737\n738\n739\n740\n741\n742\n743\n744\n745\n746\n747\n748\n749\n750\n751\n752\n753\n754\n755\n756\n757\n758\n759\n760\n\nMud volcano fluids in the Gulf of Cadiz 13\n\nGCA 5048 No. of Pages 17, Model 5+\n\n7 December 2006 Disk Used Jayalakshmi (CE) / Vijaykumar (TE)\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nC\n\ntive for geochemical reactions occurring at temperatures\nabove 150 ?C. This hypothesis is further strengthened by\ndata from other vent locations: higher Li, but lower B val-\nues have been reported from MV fluids in the Black Sea\n(Aloisi et al., 2004a) and Barbados accretionary complex\n(Godon et al., 2004). Similar Li enrichments at the Peru\nconvergent margin observed by (Martin et al., 1991) have\nbeen ascribed to alteration of oceanic basement at moder-\nate to high temperatures. Enrichments in B of up to 15 mM\nare atypical for hydrothermal fluids; hence such extreme\nlevels must be caused by extensive leaching of sedimentary\nB. This may also include the release of lattice-bound B,\nwhich makes up a significant part of the sedimentary B res-\nervoir and which is remobilised at temperatures of approx-\nimately 300 ?C (You and Gieskes, 2001; Kopf et al., 2003).\n\nBecause Li is only highly enriched at Captain Arutyu-\nnov and Bonjardim MVs, but B-levels are elevated at all\nsites where advection rates exceed 0.1 cm yr?1 (Table 4\nand Fig. 6) we hypothesize that the fluid, which is predom-\ninantly derived from clay mineral dehydration, has been\nsubject to injection of basement derived fluids, which are\nlikely Li-enriched and may additionally contribute to high-\ner levels of B and Li from leaching of clays at temperatures\n>150 ?C. Interestingly vent fluids from mid-ocean ridges\nburied beneath sedimentary cover (Von Damm et al.,\n1985, 2005) reach similar levels. This is illustrated by the\ncompilation of Li and B concentrations of various hydro-\nthermal and cold vent sites in Fig. 10. Low-temperature\nalteration sites (I) are characterised by high B/Li ratios\nand low (<100 lM) Li concentrations, high-temperature al-\ntered cold vent (II) and sediment covered hydrothermal\nvent sites (IV) show low B/Li ratios accompanied by high\n(>350 lM) Li concentrations, and hydrothermal vents at\nU\nN\n\nC\nO\n\nR\nR\n\nE\n\nFig. 10.

Thus, CAMV in particular may represent\nthe cool end member of a hydrothermal injection system\nbeneath a thick sedimentary cover, resulting in the enrich-\nment of B versus Li (Chan et al., 1999). The fact that we do\nnot observe typical hydrothermal signals, like K and Ca\nenrichments, can be ascribed to subsequent depletion by\nsmectite-illite transformation and calcium carbonate pre-\ncipitation, respectively. As discussed above, both processes\nare unambiguously occurring in the subsurface of the mud\nvolcano sites and, moreover, the supply of K is well known\nto be limiting for the smectite-to-illite reaction (e.g. Boles\nand Franks, 1979; Cuadros, 2006). Overall, Mg depletions\nare also well in line with the impact of hydrothermal solu-\ntions, even though low Mg levels are also a likely result of\ndolomite precipitation.\n\nThis general hypothesis is supported by additional\nobservations. For example, B and Li enrichments correlate\ngenerally with Sr suggesting a common release mechanism\nduring fluid formation. Sr-enriched fluids are typically\nconsidered to result from carbonate recrystallisation,\nwhich may reduce the Sr content of carbonate minerals\nby as much as an order of magnitude (Morse and Mac-\nkenzie, 1990). Mesozoic and Tertiary carbonates are wide-\nspread in the Gulf of Cadiz and may provide potential Sr-\nsources at all sites investigated. However, analyses of\n87Sr/86Sr ratios suggest that Sr originated from disparate\nfluid sources at the different MV sites (Fig. 4). Fluids at\nBonjardim and Ginsburg MVs contain less-radiogenic\nSr, which at Ginsburg MV (GeoB9061) may be related\nto dissolution of Tertiary and Cretaceous carbonates\nand evaporites (Burke et al., 1982; Banner, 2004) as sug-\ngested by the high sulphate levels at this site. However, be-\nselected cold vents (I, II), hydrothermal vents (III), sediment covered\nus similarity between fluids of fields II and IV, which are characterised by\ntions (>350 mM), implying that a high temperature imprint is preserved in\n300 ?C (You and Gieskes, 2001) are presented for comparison.

The radiogenic signature at CAMV suggests that sig-\nnificant interaction has occurred between fluids and\ncontinental crust material. This finding is supported by\ndeep seismic studies, which have shown that the eastern\npart of the Gulf of Cadiz is underlain by thick continental\ncrust covered by the Betic\u2013Rifean Allochthonous Units\n(Gonzalez-Fernandez et al., 2001; Medialdea et al., 2004;\nZeyen et al., 2005). As shown in Figs. 2 and 6, fluids from\nCAMV (and to some degree from Bonjardim MV also)\nexhibit a strong correlation between Li, B, and Sr and\nare offset from the other sites. Since Sr is also relatively\nenriched (with respect to seawater) in continental crust\nand terrigeneous sediments (shales), this finding supports\nthe hypothesis of simultaneous \u2018\u2018leaching\u2019\u2019 of these ele-\nments from clay minerals at moderate to high tempera-\ntures. Overall, the observations are consistent with data\nfrom the convergent margin off Chile where different\n87Sr/86Sr ratios of Li-enriched fluids are interpreted to\nbe caused by interaction with different crustal sources\n(Martin et al., 1991).\n\nLikewise, the molecular and isotopic composition of\nlight volatile hydrocarbon gases in expulsion fluids at\nCAMV is unusual. The gases have a clear thermogenic ori-\ngin at Ginsburg and Bonjardim MVs (Table 3). The com-\nposition of CAMV gas also indicates a thermogenic\norigin, as shown by the stable carbon isotope signature\nof ethane in gas hydrates recovered at this site (Table 3).\nHowever, the high enrichment in methane cannot result\nfrom an admixture of migrated thermogenic gas and shal-\nlow microbial methane, due to very low microbial\nmethanogenic activity in the shallow sediments (M. Nuzzo,\nunpublished data). This finding is in agreement with sedi-\nment TOC abundances that never exceed ?0.5% (Table\n1) and generally low fluid concentrations of NH4 and Br\n(Fig. 2b, Table 2; (Martin et al., 1993). A catagenic origin\nof the methane expelled at CAMV is thus a more likely\nhypothesis, consistent with fluid geochemical indications\nfor temperatures in excess of 150 ?C. In this line of evi-\ndence, increased NH4 concentrations at CAMV (Fig. 2)\ncould be the result of the thermal alteration of organic\nmaterial as reported from sediment covered hydrothermal\nvents (Thornton and Seyfried, 1987).\n\nExpulsion of hydrothermally affected fluids at Bonjar-\ndim and Captain Arutyunov MVs, but not at Ginsburg\nMV is consistent with the locations of these edifices in dif-\nferent structural environments within the Gulf of Cadiz.\nBonjardim and Captain Arutyunov MVs appear to be sit-\nuated along major crustal strike\u2013slip faults associated with\nthe Africa/Eurasia Plate Boundary (Duarte et al., 2005),\nfor which no evidence exists at Ginsburg MV (Fig. 1). It\nhas indeed been shown that stress is released at strike\u2013slip\nfaults, thus focussing the expulsion of deep over-pressured\nfluids (Behrens, 1988; Tobin et al., 1993). The emplacement\nPlease cite this article in press as: Hensen, C. et al., Sources of mud\nCosmochim.

In contrast\nto Bonjardim and Captain Arutyunov MVs, fluids at Gins-\nburg MV likely are expulsed along extensional and thrust\nfaults, similar to other MVs of the Moroccan margin\n(Van Rensbergen et al., 2005).\n\nTheoretically, the continuous rise of warm fluids should\nbe accompanied by an increased heat flow, which is not the\ncase since average geothermal gradients at all sites are\nabout 20\u201340 ?C per km (Kopf and participants, 2004).\nHowever, comparatively low overall advection rates (Table\n4) and insignificant emissions of methane into the overlying\nseawater (Niemann et al., 2006) are indicative for low pres-\nent day expulsion rates. Variations in the activity of the\nmud volcanoes have been suggested earlier for this region\n(Pinheiro et al., 2003) and are in agreement with observa-\ntions from various convergent margin settings where fluid\nadvection along deep fault zones has been identified as a\nhighly dynamic process which is subject to significant vari-\nations over time (e.g. Moore and Mascle, 1987; Martin\net al., 1991; Saffer and Bekins, 1999; Hensen and Wall-\nmann, 2005). Since a heat pulse equilibrates much faster\nin surface sediments compared to a geochemical signal as\nsoon as the supply is disconnected, the present day geo-\nchemical composition of the fluids may be represent an im-\nprint of the latest fluid pulse.\n6. Conclusions\n\nFluid geochemistry at MVs in the Gulf of Cadiz indi-\ncates that major fluid formation and overpressuring is\ncaused by clay mineral dehydration at several kilometres\ndepth and temperatures of up to 150 ?C, which is in agree-\nment with the occurrence of thermogenic methane and sim-\nilar observations at numerous cold vent areas worldwide\n(e.g. Martin et al., 1996; Da?hlmann and De Lange, 2003;\nHensen et al., 2004). Quantitatively, the fluid composition\ncan be largely explained by the transformation of smectite\nto illite; however a number of subsequent processes mask-\ning the primary fluid composition could be either proven or\nstrongly implied. These processes include the dissolution of\nhalite as well as anhydrite or gypsum, the precipitation of\ncalcium carbonate and dolomite, and potentially the\nadmixing of evaporated brines.\n\nVery strong enrichments of the minor elements Li and B\n(CAMV and Bonjardim MV) suggest high temperature\nalterations (>150 ?C) related to fluid mobilisation along\nfault systems cutting deeply into the underlying basement.\nElement enrichments may be caused by elevated concentra-\ntions in rising hydrothermal fluids and/or additional leach-\ning of these elements from the sediments at higher\ntemperatures. A compilation of various hot and cold vent\nsites (Fig. 10) suggests that strong Li enrichments in combi-\nnation with moderate B/Li ratios may be a good indicator for\nvolcano fluids in the Gulf of Cadiz\u2014indications ..., Geochim.\n\n\n\nT\nD\n\nP\nR\n\nO\nO\n\nF\n872\n873\n874\n875\n876\n877\n878\n879\n880\n881\n882\n883\n884\n885\n886\n887\n888\n889\n890\n891\n892\n893\n894\n\n895\n\n896\n897\n898\n\n899\n900\n901\n902\n903\n904\n905\n906\n907\n908\n909\n910\n911\n912\n913\n914\n915\n\n916\n\n917\n918\n919\n920\n\nFig. 11.

Geophysical data acquisition and processing, \n\nsample collection and underwater observations \n\n \n\n \n\nA large number of methodologies and techniques, commonly used in marine geology \n\nand geophysics, were used to identify seafloor structures which based on their size, shape \n\nand backscatter intensity, potentially represent mud volcanoes or seeps. Ground-truthing \n\nthrough coring, dredging and sampling with TV-controlled grabs together with underwater \n\nseafloor video observations were used to confirm the nature of these structures. In this \n\nappendix the scientific cruises which contributed with data for this thesis are briefly \n\npresented. The several geophysical, sampling and underwater observation techniques are \n\ndescribed, the instrumentation used is presented and a brief overview of the data \n\nprocessing is described. \n\n \n\nA.1 Oceanographic cruises \n\nThe work and results presented in this PhD Thesis are based on data collected in 18 \n\nscientific cruises: TTR09, TTR10, TTR11A, TTR11, TTR12, TTR14, TTR15, TTR16, \n\nTasyo, Anastasya-2000, Anastasya-2001, GAP, Cadipor, Cadisar-1 and 2, Matespro and \n\nDelila-1 and 2.

During this cruise the activities were concentrated on the \n\ninvestigation of gas hydrates, methane-derived authigenic carbonates (MDAC) and the \n\ntectonic regime in the Gulf of Cadiz (Kopf et al., 2004). The work developed during this \n\ncruise involved sediment sample collection with multi-corer, gravity corer and TV \n\ncontrolled grab, underwater video survey with OFOS (Ocean Floor Observation System), \n\nswath bathymetry, multichannel seismics, parametric parasound echosounding and heat \n\nflow measurements. \n\nThe MATESPRO (Major Tectonic and Sedimentary Processes in the Portuguese \n\nMargins) multibeam cruise, onboard the R/V D Carlos I (14 June \u2013 10 July 2004) was \n\ndevoted to multibeam survey in the South Portuguese Margin. This cruise had L. Matias \n\nand P. Terrinha (Univ. Lisbon) as chief scientist (Matias et al., 2004; Terrinha et al., 2004). \n\nThe TTR 14, Leg 1 (25 July \u2013 10 August 2004) onboard the R/V Professor Logachev \n\nwas devoted to the study of the fluid escape structures in the Gulf of Cadiz, and was \n\ncoordinated by L.

(E) R/V Sonne, GAP \n\ncruise. \n\n \n\nA.2 Navigation \n\nPositioning during the TTR cruises was acquired with an Ashtech GG24 DPS + \n\nGLONASS receiver, allowing an optimal static accuracy of \u00b1 35 cm (75 cm at 95% \n\nconfidence limits). The normal accuracy, under normal satellite configuration, in the Gulf \n\nof Cadiz area is assumed as ca. 5 m. \n\nUnderwater navigation during deep towed operations, such as the deep towed side-\n\nscan sonar (MAK1 and OREtech), deep-towed video system and TV-controlled grab was \n\nbased on the Sigma-1001 hydroacoustic system. This system consists on a pinger fitted at \n\nthe deep-towed equipment, operating between 7-15 kHz and four stationary hull-mounted \n\nacoustic receivers, spaced 14 m apart. The signal emitted by the deep-towed pinger is \n\ntracked on board and accurate x,y position of the device is computed in relation to the \n\nvessel, taking into account the vessel roll, trim and speed. The error of the estimated \n\n\n\n \n\nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n A-5\n\nposition of the deep-towed equipment by this system usually does not exceed 1-2% of the \n\nwater depth. \n\nFor gravity corer seabed sampling, the error in positioning is normally 5% of the \n\naccuracy of the vessel position, due to their rapid deployment. \n\nNavigation on board the D. Carlos I (Matespro and Delila 1 cruises), Sonne, Cornide \n\nde Saavedra and Belgica was carried out using both Global Positioning System (GPS) and \n\nDifferential Global Positioning System (DGPS), installed in one or in multiple positions of \n\nthe vessel. The two systems were used in order to allow the necessary accuracy in position \n\ndetermination, as well as the necessary yaw corrections to be used by the multibeam \n\nsystems. \n\n \n\nA.3 Multibeam bathymetry and backscatter reflectivity \n\nA.3.1 Matespro and Delila 1 cruises (NRP D. carlos I) \n\nA.3.1.1 Data acquisition \n\nThe NRP D Carlos I is equipped with a SIMRAD EM 120 multibeam system and \n\nbathymetric echo sounders: Marimatech E-Sea Sound 206S (15 kHz), an Atlas Deso 20 (33 \n\nand 210 kHz) profiler and acoustic Doppler current profiler: RDI Ocean Surveyor (38 and \n\n150 kHz). The SIMRAD EM 120 nominal sonar frequency is 12 kHz with an angular \n\ncoverage sector of up to 150 degrees and 191 beams per ping as narrow as 1 degree. \n\nAchievable swath width on a flat bottom will normally be approximately six times the \n\nwater depth. The transmit fan is split into several individual sectors with independent \n\nactive steering according to vessel roll, pitch and yaw. This places all soundings on a \u201cbest \n\nfit\u201d to a line perpendicular to the survey line, thus ensuring a uniform sampling of the \n\nbottom and 100% coverage. The sectors are frequency coded (11.25 to 12.60 kHz), and \n\nthey are all transmitted sequentially at each ping. The sector steering is fully taken into \n\naccount when the position and depth of each sounding is calculated, as is the refraction due \n\nto the sound speed profile, vessel attitude and installation angles. Pulse length and range \n\nsampling rate are variable with depth for best resolution, and in shallow waters due care is \n\ntaken to account for near field effects. The ping rate is mainly limited by the round trip \n\ntravel time in the water up to a ping rate of 5 Hz. \n\n\n\n \n\nAppendix A. Geophysical data acquisition and processing, Sample collection and Underwater observations \n\n \n\n A-6 \n\nThe system depth accuracy is very high due to the narrow beams and a high sampling \n\nrate is used (2 kHz). The expected total system RMS accuracy (assuming good external \n\nsensor data) is: 0.2% of depth (from nadir up to 45 degrees), 0.3% of the depth (up to 60 \n\ndegrees), and 0.5% of the depth (between 60 and 70 degrees). More information about this \n\nsystem can be found at the system manufacturer site: www.kongsberg.com. \n\nThe MATESPRO and Delila 1 Multibeam surveys were performed according to an \n\nOrder 3 Hydrographic Survey Standard (Standards for Hydrographic Surveys, 1998). This \n\nmeans that accurate and true sound velocity profiles had to be acquired during the survey \n\nand that all areas were covered by verification lines crossing the main survey direction at \n\n90 degrees. The verification lines covered 10% of the surveyed area. In order to minimize \n\nvertical and lateral errors associated with the external beams, and depending on the state of \n\nthe sea, an maximum opening angle of 120\u00ba (and in some cases 60-70\u00b0) was used instead \n\nof maximum angular range of 150\u00ba, restricting the coverage to a maximum of 14 km wide \n\nswath to gain an more continuous spacing of beams on the ocean floor. \n\nThe distribution of the water masses in the Gulf of Cadiz is a crucial aspect for the \n\nconversion of the recorded SIMRAD EM120 travel times into depth values. This is \n\nparticularly important in the Gulf of Cadiz where there is a strong influence on the sound \n\nvelocity along the water column as a result of the presence of the saline and warm \n\nMediterranean outflow water (MOW). Therefore, sound velocity profiles (SVP) were \n\nperformed at the rate of 1 per day during the Matespro and Delila 1 crises. During the GAP \n\ncruise, CTDOS (Conductivity, Temperature, Depth, Oxygen, Salinity), CTD \n\n(Conductivity, Temperature, Depth) were used, while XBTs were used during the RV \n\nBelgica Cadipor cruise, to calculate the sound velocity profiles on the water column. \n\nClimatological profiles of the Gulf of Cadiz region were also used to constrain the water \n\ncolumn sound velocity. \n\nA.3.1.2 Data processing \n\nThe processing of the multibeam data consists in a sequence of procedures that were \n\nperformed by the dedicated software package CARIS-HIPS. The steps generally used are: \n\ni) Conversion of the raw data from the native acquisition format to the application \n\nformat \n\nii) Quality control of the raw data \n\niii) Automatic removal of outliers with dedicated filters/procedures \n\n\n\n \n\nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n A-7\n\niv) Manual/semi-automatic removal of outliers \n\nv) Generation of cruise grids \n\nvi) Integration with other available data sets. \n\nThe processing of the Matespro raw data was performed using the CARIS-HIPS \n\nsoftware packaged (by the Instituto Hidrografico processing team). The backscatter data \n\nrecorded by the SIMRAD EM-120 system was recovered and processed first by the MB-\n\nSystem (J. Luis, Univ. Algarve) and by the CARAIBES package (S. Diez, UTM-CSIC, \n\nBarcelona). \n\nThe grids cleaned were then converted and imported into the ArcGIS GIS system and \n\nintegrated with the regional GIS database. \n\nA.3.2 GAP cruise (RV Sonne) \n\nDuring the R/V Sonne GAP cruise, a Simrad EM120 multibeam echosounder was \n\nused for continuous mapping of the seafloor. \n\nTo convert the recorded travel times into depth several water velocity profiles were \n\nobtained with the shipboard CTD. During this cruise, handling of the bathymetric data was \n\ndone by the ship\u2019s navigation system administrators. Each beam was corrected for ray \n\nbending using the appropriate sound velocity profile and the ship\u2019s motion, and finally \n\nstored with GPS position. To generate the bathymetric maps the data were averaged using \n\nthe nearest neighbour gridding algorithm, using and displayed with the GMT mapping \n\nsoftware (Wessel and Smith, 1991, 1995). However, data were not edited for clean bad \n\nbeams. The final gridded data was converted into ArcGIS format and integrated in the GIS \n\ndatabase of the Gulf of Cadiz. \n\n \n\nA.4 Seismic profiles \n\nA.4.1 PSAT seismic profiles \n\nA.4.1.1 Data acquisition \n\nSingle channel seismic reflection profiles were acquired throughout the TTR cruises. \n\nThe seismic source consisted of two 3.5 litre airguns, at a pressure of 150 atm. The airguns \n\nwere towed at a depth of approximately 3.5 meters and were shot every 10 seconds \n\n\n\n \n\nAppendix A. Geophysical data acquisition and processing, Sample collection and Underwater observations \n\n \n\n A-8 \n\n(approximately every 30 meters). The streamer consisted of one active section, 25 meters \n\nlong, with 50 hydrophones, towed at a depth of approximately 3.5 meters. The offset \n\nbetween the seismic source and the centre of the live hydrophone array was 230 meters. \n\nThroughout the seismic acquisition, the average ship\u2019s speed was about 6.5 knots. \n\nThe data was acquired digitally using the MSU developed software and preliminary \n\nprocessed with the RadExPro software, which was provided to the UNESCO MSU Centre \n\nfor Marine Geosciences by GDS Productions, Moscow. The trace legth is 8s and the \n\nsampling rate is 1 ms. The signals were filtered analogically 30-250 Hz in the acquisition \n\nstage. The preliminary on board processing was carried out using both the RadExPro \n\nsoftware and the SPW processing system (Seismic Processing Workshop). The basic \n\nprocessing sequence consisted of static shifts correction, amplitude recovery by spherical \n\ndivergence correction and simple bandpass filtering (5-20-250-300 Hz). Signature \n\ndeconvolution and phase-shift migration were also applied to some of the seismic lines to \n\nattenuate the bubble pulse and to better image the near-surface geological structure. \n\nA.4.1.2 Post-cruise data processing \n\nPost cruise processing of the seismic data collected during the TTR10, 11, 12, 14 and \n\n15 cruises within the Gulf of Cadiz was performed in collaboration with Dr Serguei \n\nBouriak using the SPW processing software (Bouriak, 2003). \n\nThe principal aim of the processing was to prepare the data sets for structural \n\ninterpretation, attempting to enhance the traceability of deep reflections, with recovering of \n\ntheir true geometry. The processing flow included predictive deconvolution, time-variant \n\nButterworth filtering, spherical divergence correction, muting, automatic gain control, and \n\nphase shift migration, as well as some additional subsidiary procedures (e.g. automatic \n\ntrace edit) when necessary. Some lines, where the water depths variations were significant, \n\nrequired flattening of the seafloor with static shifts prior to time-variant filtering, with \n\nposterior recovery of the initial topography. A characteristic example of an SPW \n\nprocessing flow used for the processing of the data sets is shown on Figure A.2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n A-9\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure A.2. SPW processing flow for TTR11 psat211 line. \n\n \n\nA.4.2 Multichannel seismics \n\nMultichannel seismic reflection (MCS) were acquired during the GAP cruise using \n\none GI gun of 1.7 l and a 100 m active length streamer with 16 channels.  \n\nDuring the TTR15-leg 4 multichannel seismic profiles were acquired using the \n\nBremen University multichannel seismic system, designed to acquire high resolution \n\nseismic data.  \n\nThe main seismic source for the survey was a Sodera GI-Gun, in true GI-Mode with \n\n2x1.7 l chamber volume. The trigger interval was 12 to 16 seconds, resulting on an average \n\nshot point spacing ranging from 31 to 41 m at 5 knots ship speed (when operating in \n\nparallel to the OKEAN) and 12 to 16 m at 2 knots ship speed (when operating in parallel to \n\nMAK). The gun was shot at a mean pressure of 120-150 bar. \n\nThe multichannel seismic streamer was towed with 3 MultiTrak Remote Units \n\n(MTCBirds) attached, used to keep the streamer in 3 m depth. The streamer included a \n\n\n\n \n\nAppendix A. Geophysical data acquisition and processing, Sample collection and Underwater observations \n\n \n\n A-10 \n\nlead-in and 2 active sections of 50 m length each. A 30 m long deck cable connected the \n\nstreamer to the recording system. The 2 active sections (SYNTRON) were each \n\nsubdivided, giving 8 hydrophone groups in total. Each of the 6.25 m long hydrophone \n\ngroups is again subdivided into 5 subgroups of different length. One of the subgroups was \n\na high-resolution hydrophone with pre-amplifier. A programming module distributes the \n\nsubgroups of 4 hydrophone groups, i.e. a total of 20 groups to 5 channels. To adapt the \n\nsystem to the water depth, deep water programming modules (instead of module 1, which \n\ncould not be removed) were selected, so that every second 6.25 m hydrophone group was \n\ncompletely used with all 13 hydrophones. \n\nThe data acquisition system, developed at the working group marine \n\ntechnology/environmental research at the University of Bremen consists of a Pentium IV \n\nbased PC (3 GHz, 1GB RAM, Windows XP) with two NI6052E 16bit AD-converters. \n\nEach ADC was connected to a 32 channel multiplexer (NI-SCXI1102-C) with onboard \n\npreamplification and anti-alias filter. The system therefore provides a maximum of 64 \n\nchannels at maximum sampling rate of 10 kHz per channel. The acquisition software was \n\nalso a custom development and provides nearly continuous recording of the 64 channels \n\nwith data storage in demultiplexed SEG-Y to hard disk. The software, allows online \n\nquality control by displaying shot gathers and an online profile plot using brute channel \n\nstacks of arbitrary channels. Data were recorded at 4 kHz over lengths of 4 - 6 seconds \n\ndepending on water depth with a delay of 0 s, resulting in 16000 \u2013 24000 samples per \n\ntrace. \n\nOn-board post-processing of the data was carried out with the Seismic processing \n\nsoftware Vista 5.1. The main target of the processing was to enhance the signal to noise \n\nratio. The following processing flow was routinely applied to the data. First, a wide \n\nbandpass filter of 5-800 Hz was used to allow trace editing. After removing bad traces, an \n\nf-k filter was applied. The filter design consists in the k-domain of two outside end \n\nrejections zones, which depends on the noise character of the data. In the frequency \n\ndomain a rejection above 200 Hz was chosen. As a next step, spherical divergence was \n\ncorrected, followed by a common-shot stack. For some profiles with obvious difraction \n\nhyperbolae, an f-k migration was used with estimated shot spacing and a constant velocity \n\nmodel. After processing, the data were printed and exported as SEG-Y. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n A-11\n\nA.5 Side-scan Sonar \n\nA.5.1 NRL Seamap sede-scan sonar mosaic \n\nDuring the NRL KANE cruise, low frequency 12 KHz side-scan sonar data was \n\ncollected using the Seamap system, which was developed and built by the Hawaii Mapping \n\nResearch Group and operated by the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVO). \n\nA.5.2 OKEAN \n\nThe OKEAN long range side-scan sonar (Figure A.3A) operates at a frequency of 9.5 \n\nkHz was used in all the TTR cruises in the Gulf of Cadiz as a first reconnaissance \n\nsurveying equipment. Its resolution is equivalent to the backscatter imagery of the EM12 \n\nswath bathymetry system and also similar to the NRL Seabeam side-scan sonar system. \n\nThe OKEAN fish is towed 40 to 80 m behind the ship at a few meters depth bellow the sea \n\nsurface, at a vessel speed of about 6 knots. The swath depends on the water depth, but in \n\nthe surveyed areas, were in general either 7 or 15 km. \n\nThe data was digitally recorded onboard, filtered and processed by the acoustic \n\nscientific teams and the imagery was than georeferenced and integrated into the ArcGIS \n\ndatabase.  \n\nA.5.3 OREtech \n\nThe OREtech deep-towed side-scan sonar fish (Figure A.3B) was towed over \n\nselected seabed features at a near constant altitude of 130 m or at about 40-45 m above the \n\nseafloor, depending of the mode of operation at 30 or 100 kHz respectively. The fish is \n\nalso equipped with a 6 kHz subbottom echosounder. The swath coverage was of 2 km or \n\n500 m wide depending on the operation frequency of 30 or 100 kHz, respectively. The data \n\nwas digitally recorded onboard, filtered, processed and georeferenced using the underwater \n\nnavigation acquired during the operations by the acoustic scientific teams. The imagery \n\nwas than integrated into the ArcGIS database. \n\nDuring the TTR09 and TTR10 a total of 34 km of survey lines with OREtech were \n\nacquired in the Gulf of Cadiz. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nAppendix A.

(C) MAK-1M deep-towed side-scan sonar used from the TTR11 to the TTR16 cruises. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n A-13\n\nA.5.4 MAK-1M \n\nThe MAK-1M is a high resolution deep-towed side-scan sonar system used on board \n\nthe R/V Professor Logachev during the TTR cruises in the Gulf of Cadiz since 2001. The \n\nMAK-1M fish is also equipped with a subbottom profiler, operating at a frequency of 5 \n\nkHz. The maximum swat coverage is 2 km (1 km per side) for a towing altitude of 150 m \n\nabove the seafloor and operating at a frequency of 30 kHz. The resolution of the system \n\nrages from 7 to 1 m across and along the track. The resolution is maximum near the nadir. \n\nDuring the TTR11 to the TTR16 the fish was towed at a nearly constant altitude of about \n\n100-150 m above the seafloor at a speed of 1.5-2 knots for 30 kHz surveys and at about 50 \n\nm above the seafloor for 100 kHz surveys. \n\nThe data was onboard recorded digitally and processed by the acoustic scientific \n\nteam. Time variant gain was applied to the data during acquisition. Onboard processing of \n\nthe data included slant-range-to-ground-range (SLT) correction, geometric correction of \n\nthe profiles for recovery of the real seafloor topography and smoothing average filtering of \n\nsonar and profiler record. The sonar individual lines were geometrically corrected for the \n\ntowing speed of the fish and converted into a standard bitmap image format. Some image \n\nprocessing routines, such as histogram equalization and curve adjustment were used to \n\nimprove the dynamic range of the imagery. Geographic georeferentiation of the obtained \n\nimagery was performed according to the positioning of the tow-fish underwater navigation \n\nacquired during the operation. The georeferenced imagery was then integrated into the \n\nArcGIS database. \n\nDuring the TTR cruises a total of 578 km of MAK-1M deep-towed side-scan sonar \n\nlines were acquired. \n\n \n\nA.6 Sub-bottom profiler \n\nA.6.1 TTR hull-mounted acoustic profiler \n\nDuring the TTR cruises in the Gulf of Cadiz a hull-mounted 3.5 kHz profiler was \n\nroutinely used in most of the operations, with continuous paper output and digital record of \n\nselected portions of the data. \n\n\n\n \n\nAppendix A. Geophysical data acquisition and processing, Sample collection and Underwater observations \n\n \n\n A-14 \n\nA.6.2 Parametric parasound \n\nThe parametric parasound system works also as a low-frequency sediment \n\nechosounder and was routinely recorded during most of the GAP cruise. The system uses \n\nthe parametric effect, which produces additional frequencies through non-linear acoustic \n\ninteraction of finite amplitude waves. The system emits simultaneously two sound waves \n\nof similar frequencies (18 and 22 kHz); as a result, a signal of the difference frequency (4 \n\nkHz) is generated. The footprint size of this signal is much smaller than in the conventional \n\nsystems and both vertical and lateral resolution are significantly improved. The recorded \n\nsignal is recorded in the native Paradigma format. \n\n \n\nA.7 Heat flow measurements \n\nHeat flow measurements were acquired during the GAP and during the Anastasya-\n\n2001 cruises. During the GAP cruise, a Lister type with a violin bow design heat flow \n\nprobe was used. The heat flow probe from the University of Bremen was used to obtain \n\ntemperature gradients and in situ thermal conductivities by a pulsed heat source method. \n\nThe operations consisted on several probe penetrations at small distances (usually 300 m \n\non top of mud volcanoes and 1000 to 2000 m apart for regional heat flow studies) along a \n\nprofile. Each penetration consisted of raising the probe about one hundred meters above \n\nthe sea floor from the previous penetration, slowly moving the ship to the next penetration \n\nsite and dropping the probe into the sediment for the next penetration. Once the probe is in \n\nthe sediment, it is left undisturbed for 7 minutes for equilibrium temperature measurements \n\n(time needed to allow the extrapolation to the equilibrium temperature after the frictional \n\ndisturbance of the penetration) and another 7 minutes, if a thermal conductivity \n\nmeasurement is made. \n\nMiniaturised autonomous temperature data loggers were used to obtain thermal \n\ngradient at selected gravity corer stations. The miniaturised temperature loggers were \n\nattached to the gravity corer at 1.1 m intervals and measured the sediment temperature. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n A-15\n\n \nFigure A.4. Heat flow probes. (A) Lister type heat flow probe with a violin bow design used in the GAP \n\ncruise and of the same type as the one used during the Anastasya-2001 cruise. (B) mini-temperature logger \n\ninstalled on a gravity corer. \n\n \n\nA.8 Underwater video observations \n\nDuring the TTR cruises a deep-towed underwater video system was used for seabed \n\nobservations. The system consists of an onboard and an underwater unit. The onboard unit \n\nconsists of a control, a recording and an amplifier unit. Signal and power transmission is \n\ndone through the traction coaxial cable. The underwater unit (Figure A.5A) is composed of \n\na frame with the light unit, a high-pressure housing containing an analogical and a digital \n\ncamera, and a power supply unit. \n\nVisualization and recording of the seafloor observations is done in real time. The \n\ncontrol of the distance of the camera to the seafloor is done by the winch operator in order \n\nto maintain a constant distance of 1.5 to 2 m. The distance of the camera to the seafloor is \n\nevaluated with a 1.5 m long cable with a weight that is observed in most of the seafloor \n\npictures. \n\nThe underwater video unit is also equipped with an echo sounder and pinger that \n\nwere used for underwater navigation. Therefore, the underwater video system, similarly to \n\n\n\n \n\nAppendix A. Geophysical data acquisition and processing, Sample collection and Underwater observations \n\n \n\n A-16 \n\nthe deep-towed side-scan sonar systems (OREtech and MAK), is acquired with underwater \n\nnavigation control. \n\nDuring the GAP cruise, on board the R/V Sonne, underwater video observations \n\nwere performed using the Ocean Floor Observation System (OFOS). The OFOS (Figure \n\nA.5B) is equipped with two video cameras (colour and black and white) a still camera, a \n\nlight system, a CTD, a compass, pitch and roll sensors, and a pinger that is used to \n\ncalculate the OFOS underwater navigation. The video streams are transmitted in real time \n\nto the on-board command and display unit where they are analogical recorded, digitized \n\nand recorded. Ship navigation and underwater navigation of the OFOS is recorded in the \n\nlogging system of the ship. The OFOS is towed at a distance of about 1.5 m above the \n\nseafloor and is manually adjusted by the winch operator. To assist on keeping a constant \n\ndistance to the seafloor a weight on a 2 m long cable is attached to the bottom of the OFOS \n\nframe. Three laser pointers are used to scale the video images. The two outside laser points \n\nare parallel and 20 cm apart, and the laser in between the two is pointing at an oblique \n\nangle, to provide an estimate of the absolute distance to the seafloor. \n\n \nFigure A.5 Underwater video systems. (A) TTR underwater video unit. In the picture is possible to recognise \n\nmounted in the frame the light system and the high-pressure housing containing the power supply. (B) OFOS \n\nsystem used during the GAP cruise. \n\n \n\nA.9 Gravity cores \n\nGravity cores were retrieved during the TTR cruises with a 6 m long gravity corer, \n\ndeployed with a 1500 kg weight. An internal plastic liner with 14.7 cm in diameter is \n\nhoused in the gravity corer. \n\n\n\n \n\nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n A-17\n\nAfter the gravity core is on deck and the removal of the core catcher, the internal \n\nplastic liner containing the sediment core is taken out and the sediment material is \n\nimmediately retrieved with a piston extruder. The core sediment is segmented in sections \n\nof 60 to 70 cm long, immediately longitudinally opened in two identical sections and \n\nexamined for occurrences of gas hydrates or intense degassing. Gas hydrates, if present, \n\nare removed and stored in cold containers. \n\nOne half of the open core is labelled, photographed and described on deck. \n\nLithological logs with indication of lithology, colours and sedimentary structures along the \n\ncore are constructed by the sedimentology teams. Core logs are shown throughout this \n\nthesis and all core logs are compiled in the respective cruise reports. The reported colours \n\ncorrespond to the Munsel Colour Charts. Magnetic susceptibility was routinely measured \n\nwith a Bartington Instruments MS2E1 probe. The magnetic susceptibility reflects the \n\npresence of magnetic material and is strongly influenced by the grain size, heavy minerals \n\ncontent and is inversely related to the carbonate content and diagenetic ferric mineral \n\nreduction. The magnetic susceptibility is also a function of temperature and negative \n\ntemperature anomalies associated with the destabilization of gas hydrates are easily \n\ndetected on the magnetic susceptibility record. \n\nThe other half of the core is then available for sediment sampling. Samples for gas \n\ngeochemistry, pore water samples, micropaleontological sub-samples and coccolith smear \n\nslides are routinely taken. \n\nDuring the GAP cruise, gravity cores were collected with a 12 m long gravity corer \n\nof 12 cm in diameter. The gravity core liners after retrievement on board were splited in \n\n1.5 m long sections and immediately scanned on a MST core logger. The MST measured \n\nproperties were: wet bulk density, P-wave velocity, magnetic susceptibility and natural \n\ngamma radiation. After the MST measurements, the core liner was splited and the core \n\nlongitudinally divided in two. One half was photographed, described and stored for \n\narchive. The other half was sub-sampled. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nAppendix A. Geophysical data acquisition and processing, Sample collection and Underwater observations \n\n \n\n A-18 \n\n \nFigure A.6.

The GTVD-2 is an \n\norange peel grab Figure A.6D that operates up to 6000 m water depth, has 3.2 tons and an \n\ninterior volume of 1.1 m3. Both systems have a video camera fitted, and power and light \n\nunits, allowing real time visualization of the seafloor during the grab operation. The \n\nonboard unit allows the visualization and record of the video images for selection of the \n\nsampling site. Underwater positioning and navigation of the TV-grab is registered by the \n\nunderwater navigation system. During the GAP cruise a tv-controled grab (Figure A.6E) \n\nwas also used to select and collect large volumes of surface sediments from the seafloor.  \n\n \n\nA.11 Box-cores \n\nBox cores were collected using a Reineck square box with 50x50x50 cm (Figure \n\nA.6F). Box cores were collected when samples of undisturbed seabed were needed. After \n\nretrievement, the box core was opened removing a side panel, the surface and side were \n\nphotographed, described and sub-samples were then collected. \n\n \n\nA.12 Kasten box-cores \n\nThe Kasten corer was used on board the R/V Professor Logachev during the TTR14, \n\nTTR15 and TTR16 cruises in the Gulf of Cadiz (Figure A.6G). It was used when large \n\namount and deeper (> 0.5 m) sediment material was needed or due to inefficiency of the \n\nother sampling equipments, in general due to the presence of large pebbles or carbonate \n\ncrusts at the seabed. It consists on a square section corer with dimensions of \n\n0.39x0.39x180 m. \n\nAfter retrieving the kasten corer, it was opened through removing a side panel, the \n\nsurface and side were photographed and described, and sub-samples were then collected. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nAppendix A. Geophysical data acquisition and processing, Sample collection and Underwater observations \n\n \n\n A-20 \n\nA.13 Dredges \n\nThe dredges used during the TTR cruises consist of a circular steel gate of 1 m2 \n\nsection (Figure A.6H) and a rectangular section (50x100 cm) dredge (Figure A.6I), both \n\nwith chain meshes that were trailed behind a 0.5 ton weight, 3 m in front of the dredge \n\ngate. The mesh size was about 5 cm. The dredge was trailed up-slope at about 0.5 knots on \n\nsites previously monitored with the 3.5 kHz hull-mounted echosounder, high resolution \n\nside-scan sonar or underwater TV observations. The dredge was used to collect hard rock \n\nmaterial such as most of the authigenic carbonate samples. After sample retrieved the \n\nsamples where photographed, washed and described onboard. In Figure A.6J is illustrated \n\nthe dredge used during the Anastasia cruises onboard the RV Cornide de Saavedra. \n\n\n\n \n\nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n \n\n B-1\n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix B.

The several analytical methods and their results are described and \n\nreported in the several chapters of the thesis. In this Appendix are reported the analytical \n\nresults tables that due to their size are not suitable to be presented within the text. \n\nIn this Appendix are tabled the results of the carbonate mineralogy, as defined from \n\nthe X-ray diffraction and corrected with the total organic carbon and the total carbonate \n\ncontent measured with the LECO CHNS-932 elemental analyser (description of this \n\nmethod is given in Chapter 5).

EDTA Differentiation of calcite and high Mg-\n\ncalcite from dolomite for stable isotope measurements \n\n \n\n \n\nC.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nMethane-derived authigenic carbonates (MDAC) collected from the Gulf of Cadiz \n\nconsists of complex mixtures of aragonite, calcite, high Mg-calcite, protodolomite and \n\ndolomite phases (Chapter 5). A selective separation of the coexisting carbonate minerals is \n\nrequired for accurate phase-specific determination of oxygen and carbon isotope \n\ncomposition of the methane-derived authigenic carbonates. As the studied samples are \n\ncharacterized by mineralogies that range in size from micrite to microsparite (Chapter 5), a \n\nphysical separation of the coexisting carbonate minerals is difficult and in general not \n\npossible to be applied, making the chemical separation as the more adequate method. \n\nChemical separation techniques based on time-dependent extraction of CO2 by \n\nreaction of the carbonate minerals at 25\u00baC with 100% phosphoric acid is widely used to \n\nachieve carbonate phase-specific carbon and oxygen isotope analysis (Alaasm et al., 1990). \n\nBut this method is difficult to use in complex carbonate mixtures of high Mg-calcite and \n\ndolomite. \n\nOther method to obtain phase-specific carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions is \n\nbased of the equation C.1, where ?total and ?dolomite are measured and ?calcite can be \n\ncalculated using the fraction of dolomite in the bulk material (X) as measured from XRD. \n\n( ) calcitedolomitetotal XX ??? \u00d7?+\u00d7= 1    (C.1) \nThis approach is used with success for the separation of calcite from dolomite. The \n\npure dolomite fraction can be obtained from dolomite-calcite mixtures by leaching with \n\n5% acetic acid solution. The time dependent CO2 extraction and the acetic acid dissolution \n\nof calcite and aragonite leaving the dolomite phase solute provides reasonable results on \n\nthe isotopic calculation of the coexisting calcium carbonates (McKenzie, 1976). However, \n\n\n\n \n\nAppendix C. EDTA Differentiation of calcite and high Mg-calcite from dolomite for stable isotope \nmeasurements \n\n C-2\n\nthese methods are also not successful in separating coexisting high Mg-calcite, \n\nprotodolomite and dolomite, as the MDAC from the Gulf of Cadiz. \n\nThe organic acid ethylenedinitrilotetraceticacid (EDTA) is known to be an \n\nalternative to dissolve calcite, based on the fact that calcite is more water soluble than \n\ndolomite and thus forms stronger complexes with EDTA (Glover, 1961; Bodine and \n\nFernalld, 1973). EDTA present the following order of effectiveness as a solvent: calcite > \n\nhigh Mg-calcite > dolomite > magnesite (Bodine and Fernalld, 1973). \n\nIn this appendix, is described the use of the EDTA and the leaching thechnique to \n\nseparate calcite and Mg-calcite from dolomite in selected samples of MDAC. This method \n\ndeveloped at the ETH, Zurich (Van Lith, 2001) proved to be efficient, allowing the \n\nseparation of dolomite from complex mixtures of calcite, high Mg-calcite and dolomite, by \n\nslow dissolution of the calcite and high Mg-calcite fraction in a boiling 0.25 M of \n\nethylenedinitrilotetraceticacid (EDTA) solution with pH 11. The carbon and oxygen \n\nisotopic composition of the bulk carbonate and of the dolomite fraction were analyzed and \n\nthe isotopic composition of calcite phase could then be calculated. \n\n \n\n \n\nC.2 Methods \n\n \n\nThe samples used in this study were selected from the collection of MDAC retrieved \n\nfrom the Gulf of Cadiz (Chapter 5). Samples for XRD, carbon and oxygen stable isotope \n\nwere extracted from transversal and longitudinal cuts and micro-drilled along radial and \n\nlongitudinal profiles of two selected dolomite chimneys. \n\nBulk mineralogy and the relative abundance of different carbonate mineralogies in \n\neach sample were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on 134 powdered samples \n\n(Table 5.1 in Chapter 5). X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained using a Scintag \n\nXDS2000 X-ray diffractometer with CuK? radiation (1.5405 \u00c5 wavelength) at the \n\nGeological Institute of the ETH Zurich. Scans were done from 5\u00ba to 60\u00ba 2? at 0.02\u00ba/sec, \n\nusing 40 kV accelerating voltage and 30 mA current. As the intensity of the diffraction \n\npattern of a mineral in a mixture is proportional to its concentration, estimates of the \n\nrelative proportions of the minerals in a sample were made by measuring their relative \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n C-3\n\npeak areas. Peak identification and minerals relative abundance estimation were performed \n\nusing the Scintag interpretation software and the MacDiff\u00ae software packages. Error \n\nassociated with the mineralogy content determination is estimated to be 7%. The Mg:Ca \n\nratio of the carbonate minerals was calculated from the shift of the d-spacing of the (104) \n\nreflection peak of calcite and dolomite from the stechoimetric peaks positions in the \n\ndiffraction spectra (Goldsmith and Graf, 1958; Lumsden, 1979). \n\n( )99.91133.333100% 1043 ?\u00d7?= dMgCOmole   (C.2) \nThe peak areas were measured for the main peaks of the carbonate minerals: calcite \n\n(&lt;8 mol% MgCO3, 3.036 to 3.012 \u00c5), high Mg-calcite (8 to 30 mol% MgCO3, 3.012 to \n\n2.946 \u00c5), protodolomite or Ca-dolomite (30 to 40 mol% MgCO3, 2.946 to 2.916 \u00c5) and \n\ndolomite (40 to 55 mol% MgCO3, 2.916 to 2.871 \u00c5). \n\nCarbon and oxygen isotopes in powdered bulk samples and in EDTA leaching \n\nresidue were analysed at the Geological Institute of the ETH Zurich. Samples for carbon \n\nand oxygen stable isotopic analyses were prepared by reacting at 90\u00b0C with 100% \n\nphosphoric acid on an automated carbonate device connected to a VG-PRISM mass \n\nspectrometer calibrated with NBS19, NBS 18 and NBS 20. The results are reported in the \n\nconventional ? \u2030-notation with reference to VPDB (Vienna Peedee Belemnite). Analytical \n\nreproducibility of the method, based on repeated standards is better than \u00b10.1\u2030 for both \n\ncarbon and oxygen. For temperature calculations of the dolomite samples, dolomite ?18O \n\nvalues were corrected for the analytical offset of +1.63\u2030, consequence of the unequal \n\noxygen fractionation during the reaction to CO2 (Rosenbaum and Sheppard, 1986).  \n\nAfter retrieve the powdered samples by micro-drill, each sample was spitted in two \n\nfractions. One sub-sample was used for XRD analysis and for carbon and oxygen isotope \n\nanalyse of the bulk carbonate. The second sub-sample was leached with 20 ml boiling 0.25 \n\nM EDTA solution at pH 11 during 24 hours in glass covered containers to avoid \n\nevaporation. The solvent level was maintained at 20 ml/g by adding distilled water. After \n\n24 hours the sub-sample was taken out of the EDTA solution, washed in distilled water, \n\nfreeze dried, examined with XRD and measured for carbon and oxygen isotopic \n\ncomposition. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nAppendix C. EDTA Differentiation of calcite and high Mg-calcite from dolomite for stable isotope \nmeasurements \n\n C-4\n\nC.3 Results and Discussion \n\nC.3.1 XRD results \n\nThe high Mg content in the calcite (&lt;8 mol% MgCO3, 26.50 to 29.63 2? degrees), \n\nMg-calcite (8 to 30 mol% MgCO3, 29.63 to 30.31 degrees), and the Ca-content in the \n\nprotodolomite or Ca-dolomite (30 to 40 mol% MgCO3, 30.31 to 30.63 degrees) and in the \n\ndolomite (40 to 55 mol% MgCO3, 30.63 to 31.12 degrees) phases of the MDAC from the \n\nGulf of Cadiz caused significant shifts of the respective 2? peaks in the X-ray \n\ndiffractogram relative to the standard 2? peaks of pure calcite, Mg-calcite, protodolomite \n\nand stoichiometric dolomite (Figure C.1 to Figure C.7). \n\nEDTA leaching method proved to be efficient as a dissolving calcite and Mg-calcite \n\nleaving dolomite intact when the bulk dolomite:(calcite + Mg-calcite) is high. The 0.25 M \n\nEDTA solution allowed the leaching of a mixture of 74:26 dolomite:(high Mg-calcite + \n\ncalcite) to a 100:0 (wt%:wt%) mixture in 24 hours (Figure C.3). Sample 3463-B02.24, \n\nwith a original dolomite:(high Mg-calcite + calcite) ration of 43:57 was not able to \n\ncompletely dissolve the calcite + Mg-calcite mixture and lead to a residue with 54:46 ratio \n\n(Figure C.5). Similar experiments (Van Lith, 2001) have demonstrated that when the start \n\nmaterial contained more than 60% high Mg-calcite, the difference in solubility is not \n\nsufficient to significantly enrichment of the sample in dolomite. In these situations a longer \n\nreaction time have to be used. In conclusion mixtures with high amounts of dolomite (such \n\nas samples: 3463-A03.08, 3463-A03.09, 3463-A03.95, 3463-A03.10, 3463-B02.25, 3463-\n\nB02.26) resulted in a good dissolution of calcite and Mg-calcite and a complete \n\npurification of the dolomite carbonate phase (Table C.2). \n\nDue to a more controlled and slower dissolution reaction rate, the EDTA is a good \n\nalternative to the weak acid method to separate carbonate minerals for accurate phase-\n\nspecific isotope measurements. \n\n \nTable C.1.

The dolomite fraction have consistently lighter carbon isotopic values and \n\nheavier oxygen isotopic values. This difference between the different carbonate phases, \n\ncan reach 25% for the original ?13C bulk sample value and up to 27% of the original ?18O \n\nbulk sample value. This puts in evidence the relevance of separating the coexistent \n\ncarbonate mineralogies for accurate temperature calculations and to evaluate the fluid \n\ncompositions and the potential influence of heavy water from decomposition of gas \n\nhydrates, as discussed in Chapter 6. \n\nThe ?18O isotopic composition of pure dolomite fraction shows an average value of \n\n+5.69\u2030 \u00b1 0.28 (PDB) while the mixture of the different carbonates presents lower values. \n\nThis is evident in the ?18O isotopic values function of the dolomite/(calcite + Mg-calcite) \n\nratios in Figure C.9. The extrapolation of the regression line to a pure calcite composition \n\nindicates a oxygen isotopic value of 1.4\u2030 (PDB). The application of equation C.1 to the \n\nestimation of the isotopic values of the pure mixture of calcite and high Mg-calcite is \n\nshown in Table C.2. The estimated ?18O isotopic composition of calcite+high Mg-calcite \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n C-9\n\n(to be noted that there is a clear higher abundance of calcite in this mixture), is ranging \n\nfrom -0.14 to +1.92\u2030, corresponding to isotopic values close to 0\u2030 i.e. values close to \n\nnormal seawater composition. Indicating the precipitation from close to normal seawater \n\nfluids. So, most probably, the calcite phase (to be noted that there is a clear higher \n\nabundance of calcite in relation to Mg-calcite) correspond to pelagic calcite material from \n\nforaminifera and other calcite tests precipitated from normal seawater. \nTable C.2.

There is no clear relationship between the \nmineralogy and ?13C values. \n\n \n\nThis trend is not so evident for all the dolomite chimneys crusts and nodules samples \n\n(Figure C.10). Although the ?18O isotopic composition of the enriched dolomite samples \n\nclear present heavier isotopic values than the samples more enriched in calcite. These is \n\ninterpreted as an indication of precipitation of dolomite from fluids that are different from \n\nthe normal seawater composition from which calcite is dominantly precipitated from. \n\nThese oxygen isotopic difference between dolomite and calcite+high Mg-calcite reveal \n\ndifferent fluid composition of the fluids from which the different carbonates had \n\nprecipitate.

EDTA Differentiation of calcite and high Mg-calcite from dolomite for stable isotope \nmeasurements \n\n C-12\n\nThe extrapolations of the ?13C values for pure dolomite and pure calcite phases, \n\nbased on the ?13C values of bulk and leached material (Figure C.12) indicate ?13C \n\ncompositions ranging from -57\u2030 to -28\u2030 (PDB) for pure dolomite phase. For the calcite \n\nand Mg-calcite phases 13C is strongly enriched with the extrapolated values ranging from -\n\n2 to -23\u2030 (PDB). Comparing these values with the function obtained by the linear fit for \n\nall bulk samples from Figure C.11 the end-members isotopic compositions (-38\u2030 \u00b1 10\u2030 \n\n(PDB) for pure dolomite and -18\u2030 (PDB) for a pure calcite + high Mg-calcite mixture) is \n\nwithin these values. The calculated 13C composition for the end-member calcite (Table \n\nC.2) presents an average value of -9.83\u2030 \u00b1 6.17\u2030 (PDB). \n\nIn conclusion both EDTA and bulk samples clear indicate a closer to the normal \n\nseawater isotopic composition, as also seen on the oxygen isotopes, for the calcite and a \n\nlighter isotopic composition for dolomite.

The extrapolated ?13C values for pure dolomite phase ranges from -57\u2030 to -\n28\u2030 (PDB), whereas 13C is strongly enriched in the calcite and Mg-calcite phases with the extrapolated \nvalues ranging from -2 to -23\u2030 (PDB). \n\n \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n C-13\n\nC.4 Conclusions \n\n \n\nIn summary, EDTA leaching technique was used to differentiate between coexisting \n\ncalcite Mg-calcite and dolomite in a controlled and simple technique. Using a 0.25 M \n\nEDTA solution, a mixture of 74:26 dolomite:calcite+high Mg-calcite was altered to a \n\n100:00 (wt%:wt%) mixture in 24 hours. Due to a more controlled and slower dissolution \n\nreaction rate, the EDTA is a good alternative to the weak acid method to separate \n\ncarbonate minerals for accurate phase-specific isotope measurements. \n\nThe selective separation of the coexisting carbonate minerals allowed the \n\nidentification of different carbon and oxygen isotopic values of the different mineral \n\nphases. Pure dolomite shows on average ?18O isotopic composition of +5.69\u2030 \u00b1 0.29 \n\n(PDB). On average, pure dolomite shows an constant depletion in ?13C of -5.49\u2030 \u00b1 2.08\u2030 \n\n(PDB) in relation to the bulk carbonate. Extrapolated ?18O isotopic composition of pure \n\ncalcite or a mixture of calcite + high Mg-calcite (no dolomite) indicate a calculated value \n\nof +0.93\u2030 \u00b1 0.67 (PDB). The extrapolation from the linear best fit of the plot of the ?18O \n\nisotopic composition as function of dolomite proportion indicates to a estimated \n\ncomposition for pure calcite phase or to the mixture of calcite + high Mg-calcite of 1.4\u2030 \n\n(PDB). So, all the indications point to near seawater composition of the calcite phase and a \n\npositive ?18O isotopic composition of the dolomite. The extrapolated ?13C for a pure calcite \n\n+ high Mg-calcite mixture indicate a value of -18\u2030 (PDB). \n\nThese differences in isotopic composition of the different mineral phases reveal \n\ndifferent fluid composition of the fluids from which the carbonates had precipitated from \n\nand are discussed in chapter 6. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n D-1\n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix D.  Biomarkers: samples preparation and \n\nanalysis \n\n \n\n \n\nD.1 Introduction \n\nIn this Appendix is described the sample preparation and analytical procedure for \n\nbiomarker analysis. The lipid biomarkers analyses were carried out by the author in the \n\nMarine Biogeochemistry Laboratory of the Research Center for Ocean Margins (RCOM), \n\nof the Bremen University (Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2005) in collaboration with Prof. Jorn \n\nPeckmann and Dr Daniel Birgel of the RCOM. \n\nThe samples selected for biomarker analysis were chosen based on previous \n\npetrographic and mineralogical descriptions in order to analyse samples representative of \n\nthe different types of methane-derived authigenic carbonates (MDAC) identified in the \n\nGulf of Cadiz. As the oxidation processes is effective in reducing the preservation of the \n\norganic compounds present in the carbonate, the selected samples were the ones that \n\nshowed lower oxidation degree and the most massive and un-alterated characteristics. In \n\nTable D.1 are listed the samples selected for biomarker analysis at the RCOM centre. \n\nThe aragonite pavements are considered to represent a more recent carbonate than \n\nthe dolomite chimneys and previous studies (Duarte, 2005; Niemann et al., 2005; Niemann \n\net al., 2006) have already shown that the biomarker indicators are abundant in this type of \n\nsamples. The aragonite pavement sample 3340 (Figure 8.2) was selected because it shows \n\nno signs of oxidation. From this aragonite pavement sample, 20 g of material was collected \n\nand prepared for biomarker extraction. From the dolomite chimney samples 3463-A08 and \n\n3722-A33 (Figure 8.2), 250 g of material was collected and prepared for biomarker \n\nextraction by fragmenting to small 5 cm thick slices, avoiding the periphery and fractured \n\nparts of the samples that can act as contamination sources. \n\nThese results were complemented with lipid biomarker analyses performed at the \n\nMax Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology Bremen by L. Santos and H. Niemann \n\n\n\n \nAppendix D.  Biomarkers: samples preparation and analysis \n\n D-2\n\n(Santos et al., 2006) and the results are presented in Chapter 8. \n\nThe analytical procedure described in this Appendix is similar to the analytical \n\nprocedure of the samples analysed at the Max Plank Institute for Marine Microbiology \n\nBremen. \nTable D.1.

(2004). The analytical \n\nmethodology used for the dolomite chimney samples is described by the flowchart in \n\nFigure D.2 and for the aragonite pavements the analytical methodology used is described \n\nin the flowchart of Figure D.1. \n\nThe freshly broken carbonate samples were decalcified (HCl) and the dried residue \n\nwas refluxed in 6% KOH in CH3OH (saponification reaction: 2 h). The supernatant was \n\ndecanted and the residue was repeatedly extracted by ultrasonication in CH2Cl2/CH3OH \n\n(3:1; v:v) until the solvent became colourless. Subsequently, the combined supernatants \n\nwere portioned in CH2Cl2 versus water (pH 2). The resulting total extract was dried and \n\nseparated by column chromatography (Merck silica gel 60, 0.063-0.200 mm; i.d.: 15 mm, \n\nlength: 35 mm) into fractions containing: (1) hydrocarbons (20 ml or 3 column volumes of \n\nn-hexane); (2) esters/ketones (20 ml of n-hexane/CH2Cl2 2:1); (3) alcohol (20 ml of \n\nCH2Cl2/aceton 9:1; (4) fatty acids/polars (20 ml of MeOH). The esters/ketones and alcohol \n\nfractions were dried and derivatised using pyridine and BSTFA (2:1) at 70\u00baC (1 h). The \n\npolar fractions/fatty acids were dried and transesterificated with boron-trifluoride methanol \n\nand then with KCl + hexane. The internal standard used for all fractions was Cholestane. A \n\nmodification of the method by doing a previous extraction with CH2Cl2/CH3OH (3:1; v:v) \n\nprior to decalcification proved to be efficient in cleaning dirt peaks on the dolomite \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n D-3\n\nsamples. Above are described the analytical sequence procedure used. \n\n \n\nD.2 Decalcification \n\nThe first step in this process is the dissolution (decalcification) of the carbonate \n\nfraction, using the following procedure: \n\n1. The carbonate piece of the sample to analyse is first crushed into small chips. In \n\nthe case of the hard dolomitic chimneys, the sample was cut into smaller slices and \n\ncrushed with a silicic acid mortar and pestle;  \n\n2. The beaker where the sample was placed for reaction was cleaned with DCM1 \n\n(CH2Cl2) by washing the beaker twice, not forgetting also to wash the edges of the \n\nrecipient. \n\n3. The small chips of the sample were cleaned 2 or 3 times with acetone to prevent \n\nand eliminate any possible contamination during the handling of the sample by dust \n\nor any other contaminant. \n\n4. Cleaning the separatory funnel with Millipore water and DCM 3 times, having \n\nspecial attention on cleaning the lead and the stopper of the funnel. Filling the \n\nfunnel with HCl 10% vol. and placing it to decant over the beaker with the sample \n\ncovered with Millipore water. \n\n5. The decalcification reaction is started by adding water and then adding the acid \n\n(HCl 10% vol.) onto the sample, drop by drop, shaking with a magnum. Once the \n\nreaction diminishes more acid is added, controlling the pH of the solution so that it \n\nwill not be more acid than 2. The reaction needs to be kept until a sufficient amount \n\nof sample is dissolved. The control of the reaction is done by \u201ceye control\u201d; once \n\nthe bubbling of the acid stops or diminishes more acid is added to the solution. \n\n6. Centrifuging the sample: once the reaction is kept for sufficient time and enough \n\nmaterial is dissolved, the solution is centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2000 rpm. The \n\nsupernatant is discarded and the residue is dried overnight on the oven at 50\u00baC. \n\n \n\n                                                           \n1 DCM - DiCloroMethane  (CH2Cl2) is used as a solvent of organic matter so it can be used to clean the glass \n\nmaterial. DCM is also be used to clean the samples thenselves. \n\n\n\n \nAppendix D.  Biomarkers: samples preparation and analysis \n\n D-4\n\nD.3 Saponification \n\nSaponification was done with 6% KOH in MeOH, through the addition of 30 ml of \n\nKOH in MeOH 6% to the sample (solid phase), a closed vial, and by letting it to react for 2 \n\nhours in ultrasonic bath at 40\u00baC. After the saponification reaction, the supernatant was \n\ncollected in a centrifuge tube. \n\n \n\nD.4 Extraction \n\n1.

Once all \n\nthe DCM is drained, the salt is washed with 10 ml DCM to guarantee that all the \n\nsolution with organic compounds is washed to the evaporation tube and none is \n\n\n\n \nAuthigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\n D-5\n\nretained in the Na2SO4 or in the glass wool. \n\nv. Evaporation of the DCM with N2 gas flux. The evaporator uses evaporation \n\ntubes with 1 ml bottom \u201cnipple-tube\u201d. Settings of the N2 evaporator were: (1) \n\npressure = 1.8 Psi or 1.2 bar; (2) Mode: automatic sensor; (3) bath temperature: \n\n37\u00baC. \n\nvi.
