Aim: The aim of this study was porosity and compression strength of a GIC, that was added to different \nconcentrations of CHX. Material and method: Specimens were prepared with GIC (Ketac Molar Esaymix) and \ndivided into 4 groups according to the concentration of CHX: control, 0.5% and 1% and 2% (n\u00a0=\u00a010). For analysis \nof pores specimens were fractured with the aid of hammer and chisel surgical, so that the fracture was performed \nin the center of the specimens, dividing it in half and images were obtained from a scanning electron microscope \n(SEM) analyzed in Image J software. The compressive strength test was conducted in a mechanical testing machine \n(EMIC\u00a0-\u00a0Equipment and Testing Systems Ltd., Joseph of the Pines, PR, Brazil). Statistical analysis was performed by \nANOVA, Tukey test. Significance level of 5%. Result: No statistically significant changes between the study groups \nwas observed both for the number of pores as well as for the compressive strength. Conclusion: The use of GIC \nassociated with CHX gluconate 1% and 2% is the best option to be used in dental practice.\n\nDescriptors: Glass ionomer cements; chlorhexidine; porosity.\n\n10.1590/rou\n\n\nRev Odontol UNESP. 2014; 43(4): 236-240 Effect of chlorhexidine gluconate on porosity \u2026 237\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGlass ionomer cements (GICs) have the potential of \npreventing caries disease and possess important properties, such \nas biocompatibility, chemical adhesiveness to dental structures, \nfluoride-releasing capacity, reabsorption of fluoride from oral \nenvironmen1-3. They also have the capacity of re-organising \ndental tissues and inhibiting bacterial growth4.\n\nIt is known that chlorhexidine (CHX) can be released into \nthe oral cavity5, thus being incorporated to GICs in order to \npotentialise the antibacterial effect of this material5,6. CHX \nstands out for its proven effectiveness against wide spectrum of \npathogens oral cavity7,8 and low toxicity9.\n\nAdding CHX to GIC can result in changes in the material\u2019s \nmechanical properties because its micro-structure is affected5. \nFactors such as integrity of the interface between glass particles \nand polymeric matrix, size of the particles, amount and size of the \npores in the material all play an important role in determining the \nmechanical properties7,10 such as compressive strength10.\n\nStudies have been carried out in order to incorporate \nantibacterial agents to GICs3,5,6,7,11-14, such as CHX at \ndifferent concentrations, showing effective results for certain \nmicroorganisms under in vitro conditions (Streptococcus \nmutans)3,6,12. Nevertheless, the incorporation of antibacterial \nagents into restorative materials can result in changes in their \nphysical properties depending the concentration used3,5,6.\n\nDespite the scientific evidence demonstrating changes in \nsome mechanical properties of GICs associated to CHX, the \nliterature shows no study reporting this effect on the porosity \nof this material. Therefore, the objective of this study was to \nassess the area and number of pores as well as the compressive \nstrength of a GIC to which different concentrations of CHX were \nadded. The hypothesis to be tested is that the addition of different \nconcentrations of CLX not promote changes in the number and \nsize of pores, as well as the strength of compression resistance.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHOD\n\nForty specimens, for each testing being conducted, were \nprepared (3mm height x 6mm diameter) for four experimental \ngroups divided according to the following CHX concentrations: \ncontrol (no CHX); GIC\u00a0 +\u00a0 0.5% CHX; GIC\u00a0 +\u00a0 1% CHX; and \nGIC\u00a0 +\u00a0 2% CHX. The material used was a Ketac Molar Easymix \ncement (3M Espe, Seefeld, Germany) manipulated according \nto the manufacturer\u2019s instructions by using plastic spatula and \npaper pad at controlled room temperature (23\u00b11\u00b0C), air relative \nhumidity of 50\u00b15%, and then inserted into the matrix by using a \nCentrix syringe (DFL, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil).\n\nThe different concentrations of CHX were obtained from \na 20% CHX solution (Sigma Aldrid, Steinheim, Germany) \nand then added to GIC during their manipulation by using a \nmicro-pipette. After filling the matrices with one increment, \nthe material was covered with polyester tape and a glass plate, \non which a 100\u00a0 gram weight was placed during 40 seconds \nfor accommodation and extravasation of excess material. The \n\nspecimens of all groups were prepared by only one person, thus \nassuring the same characteristics for manipulation and insertion \nof the material.\n\nPrior to evaluation of the porosity, the samples were stored \nin an oven for 1 hour at 37oC and 90% relative humidity, then \nfractured aided surgical chisel and hammer, so that the fracture \nwas performed in percent of the test body, dividing it in half and \nsubmitted to scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The resulting \nimages (100x magnification) were analysed by using a Image J \nsoftware (Rasband WS, Image J; US National Institutes of Health, \nBethesda, MD, USA). In order to standardise the area to be \nanalysed, the image was divided into quadrants and the upper \nleft quadrant of each one was selected by using the software tools. \nNext, pores were delimitated and calculated15,16.\n\nFor assessment of the compressive strength, the specimens \n(n=10) were stored in oven for 24 hours at 37oC and 90% relative \nhumidity and then submitted to mechanical testing in a universal \ntesting machine (EMIC\u00a0 -\u00a0 Equipamentos e Sistemas de Ensaios \nLtda, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Pinhais, PR, Brazil) with load cell of 5 kN and \noperating at a cross-speed of 0.5 mm/min.\n\nThe values of area and number of pores and compressive \nstrength were analysed in terms of data distribution and variance \nhomogeneity by using the Shapiro-Wilk, Levene, and ANOVA \ntests. The SPSS version 13.0 software was used for statistics tests \nat significance level of 5% (P &lt;0.05).\n\nRESULT\n\nData on area occupied by pores and number of them as well \nas on compressive strength of the material are listed in Table\u00a01.\n\nThe values of area occupied by pores in the GIC had normal \ndistribution (Shapiro-Wilk\u2019s test, p\u00a0 =\u00a0 0.062) and variance \nhomogeneity (Levene\u2019s test, p\u00a0=\u00a00.366). Adding CHX at different \nconcentrations resulted in no statistically significant change in \nthe area of pores (ANOVA, p\u00a0=\u00a00.083).\n\nAnalysis of the number of pores revealed normal distribution \n(Shapiro-Wilk\u2019s test, p\u00a0 =\u00a0 0.08) but no variance homogeneity \n(Levene\u2019s test, p\u00a0 =\u00a0 0.002). Adding CHX at a concentration of \n0.5% (Figure\u00a0 1) decreased significantly the number of pores in \nthe material (ANOVA with Tamhane`s correction, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). At \nconcentrations of 1% and 2% (Figure\u00a01), no statistically significant \ndifferences were observed in the number of pores compared to \nthe control group (Figure\u00a01).\n\nThe values of compressive strength had normal distribution \n(Shapiro-Wilk`s test, p=0,776) and variance homogeneity \n(Levene\u2019s test, p\u00a0 =\u00a0 0,081). Addition of CHX at different \nconcentrations did not change the compressive strength of GIC \nsignificantly (ANOVA, p\u00a0=\u00a00.627)\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nStudies have been conduced to better understand the \nproperties of GICs, with compressive strength test being the \nmost common method used for assessing the resistance of these \n\n\n\n238 Marti , Azevedo, Mata et al. Rev Odontol UNESP. 2014; 43(4): 236-240\n\nmaterials17. In fact, this test allows mechanical integrity of these \nmaterials to be assessed18.\n\nThe resistance of GICs is affected by the internal porosity \ndepending on the method of manipulation as well, since \nhand-mixed cements have bubbles whose diameter is greater \nthan that of the bubbles observed in encapsulated ones19. The \ngeneralised and inherent formation of pores within the GIC \nreduces its strength to flexion and cohesion20,11. These pores \nare regions of high concentration of stress, which increased the \nlikelihood of fracture of the material22.\n\nThe capacity of the restorative materials to resist to functional \nforces is an important requisite for its long-term clinical \nperformance. To be clinically accepted, the modified materials \nmust have superior antimicrobial activity and show properties \ncomparable to those of the conventional ones22.\n\nIn order to improve the antibacterial properties of the GICs, \nthe addition of CHX to this material has been tested and showed \nexcellent results3,10,17,23. According to Palmer\u00a0 et\u00a0 al5., GICs have \nthe potential of slowly releasing active agents, such as fluoride24, \nand the CHX incorporated into GICS can be similarly released \ninto the oral cavity. This association is aimed at reducing severity \nand frequency of secondary caries by decreasing failures and \nunsuccessful use of these restorative materials6,7,12,25. Based on the \nobservation of the presence of viable bacteria in the remaining \ndentin after removal of the infected layer and proper sealing of \nthe cavity researchers observed that under in vitro conditions \nthe addition of CHX to the GIC showed favorable antibacterial \neffect against microorganisms such as Streptococcus mutans, \nLactobacillus spp., Candida albicans and Actinomyces naeslundii, \n\nacts on the biofilm act on the biofilm, which begins to show less \npathogenic composition compared to acidogenic biofilm with a \npredominance of S. mutans, which would be formed without the \npresence of the antibacterial agent3,9,11-14,23,25\n\nT\u00fcrk\u00fcn\u00a0 et\u00a0 al.3 demonstrated that GIC and CHX at a \nconcentration of 0.5% have a long-term antibacterial effect without \ncompromising the physical properties of the restorative material. \nHowever, concentrations at 1.25 and 2% weaken the material \nby compromising its physical properties, such as resistance to \nerosion, compression, diametrical traction, flexion, setting time, \nand surface hardness3. According to Jedrychowski\u00a0 et\u00a0 al.7 , CHX \ndigluconate increases the antibacterial activity when added to \nGIC, since it diffuses more rapidly than the cement as the latter \nis in powder form (CHX diacetate). However, this can change the \nphysical and mechanical properties of the cement as the volume \nof liquid in the mixture is increased7.\n\nThe present study demonstrated that although GIC mixed \nwith CHX at a concentration of 0.5% had resulted in no change \nin the area occupied by pores, the number of pores was decreased. \nThis fact indicates that pores are likely to be larger at this \nconcentration, which causes restorations to be more susceptible \nto failures or alterations26.\n\nIn a longitudinal study of restorations using the ART \ntechnique, Frencken\u00a0et\u00a0al.24 observed that half of the restorations \npresented failures. Of these, half of the failures were related to \nthe physical properties of the cement used and its manipulation \nby the operators. The presence of pores also makes the material \nmore friable26,27.\n\nTable\u00a0 1.

However, the \ninternal porosity of the material is not completely eliminated15.\n\nWith regard to the compressive strength, it was observed in \nthe present study that different concentrations of CHX added \nto GIC did not change the results of the tests applied, thus \ncorroborating studies conducted by Farret\u00a0 et\u00a0 al.23. However, \nT\u00fcrk\u00fcn\u00a0et\u00a0al.3 observed GIC mixed with CHX at concentrations \nof 0.5% and 2% presented significant changes in the compressive \nstrength. Jedrychowski\u00a0 et\u00a0 al.7 demonstrated that adding CHX \n\nat concentrations higher than 5% had significantly affected the \ncompressive strength of the GIC by decreasing it by 5%.\n\nAccording to Naasan, Watson18, testing the compressive \nstrength allows us to know the mechanical integrity of the \nmaterials, including the GICs.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe use of GIC associated with CHX gluconate 1% and 2% is \nthe best option to be used in dental practice.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.
