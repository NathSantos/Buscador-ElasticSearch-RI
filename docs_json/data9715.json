The soil bioremediation was simulated in Bartha \nbiometer flasks, used to measure the microbial CO2 production, during 48 days, where vinasse was added at a \nconcentration of 33 mL.Kg-1 of soil. Biodegradation efficiency was also measured by quantifying the total petroleum \nhydrocarbons (TPH) by gas chromatography. The groundwater bioremediation was carried out in laboratory \nexperiments simulating aerated (bioreactors) and not aerated (BOD flasks) conditions. In both the cases, the \nconcentration of vinasse was 5 % (v/v) and different physicochemical parameters were evaluated during 20 days. \nAlthough an increase in the soil fertility and microbial population were obtained with the vinasse, it demonstrated \nnot to be adequate to enhance the bioremediation efficiency of diesel oil contaminated soils. The addition of the \nvinasse in the contaminated groundwaters had negative effects on the biodegradation of the hydrocarbons, since \nvinasse, as a labile carbon source, was preferentially consumed.  \n \nKey words: Bioremediation, soil, groundwater, diesel oil, biostimulation, vinasse \n \n \n\n                                                           \n* Author for correspondence: adrianomariano@yahoo.com.br \n\nINTRODUCTION \n \nVinasse is a byproduct of the alcohol distillation \nprocess, whose disposal represents a major \nenvironmental concern mainly due to the great \nvolume generated and its high biological oxygen \ndemand. In general, to produce one liter of \nalcohol, 10 to 15 liters of vinasse are produced, \ndepending on cane quality and the industrial \nprocess (Cortez et al., 1992), which corresponds to \napproximately 170 billion liters per year of this \n\nresidue in Brazil (Agrianual, 2004). Considering \nthat every two liters of vinasse is equivalent to the \ndomestic sewage generated by one person per day \n(Lukssemberg et al., 1980 apud Gon\u00e7alves and \nSilva, 2000), the annual production of vinasse \ncorresponds to the domestic sewage produced by \nan estimate population of 232 million people \nduring one year. \nThis residue is a light-brown liquid consisting \nbasically of water (93 %), organic solids and \nminerals (7 %). Its chemical composition is \n\n\n\nMariano, A. P. et al \n\nBraz. Arch. Biol. Technol. v.52 n.4: pp. 1043-1055, July/Aug 2009 \n \n\n1044\n\nvariable, depending, among other factors, on water \navailability, sugar-cane characteristics and the \nfermentation and distillation processes employed \n(Ferraz et al., 1986). In general, vinasse presents \nhigh turbidity and low pH, with high levels of \norganic matter (mainly glycerol, a soluble carbon \nsource), potassium, calcium and moderate amounts \nof nitrogen and phosphorus (Rodella et al., 1983; \nTauk, 1987; G\u00f3mez and Rodr\u00edguez, 2000). \nIn Brazil, it is very common to dispose the vinasse \nin agricultural fields, a process called ferti-\nirrigation, as a partial or total substitute for mineral \nfertilizers, mainly potassium. This idea is a more \nenvironmental friendly option than the previous \ndisposal, when vinasse was discharged in rivers \nnearby the usines, and had a good acceptance by \nthe distilleries due to its technical simplicity and \neconomic advantages (Corazza, 1999).  In S\u00e3o \nPaulo State, where the majority of the sugar cane \nfields is located, this agricultural procedure is \ncontrolled by a specific legislation that determines \nhow to calculate the vinasse dosage (Cetesb, \n2005b). Vinasse addition at adequate rates has \ndemonstrated to increase sugar cane production. \nHowever, in a long term, the intensive application \nof vinasse can increase the soil salinity (Corazza, \n1999), affect the sugar cane quality and \ncontaminate the groundwater (Gon\u00e7alves and \nSilva, 2000). Some works have shown that vinasse \ncan modify temporarily some soil chemical and \nbiological characteristics, such as pH, organic \ncarbon, changeable acidity (Camargo et al., 1987) \nand the microbial activity and biomass (Minhoni \nand Cerri, 1987). Ramalho and Sobrinho (2001) \nobserved that the use of vinasse in large scale did \nnot alter significantly the heavy metals \nconcentration in soil. Fontes (1988), Cardoso \n(1988) and Itamar (1987) observed that vinasse \nincreased the concentrations of calcium, \nmagnesium, organic matter and mainly potassium, \ncausing an elevation of the soil electrical \nconductivity. \nConsidering that the ethanol production in Brazil \nis in expansion due to a rising internal and world-\nwide demand for alternative energy sources and \nthat soils have a limited support capability to \nreceive the vinasse, there is a need for alternative \nmethods to treat or re-use the vinasse. Corazza \n(1999) described alternative technologies where \nthe vinasse could be recycled in the fermentation \nprocess, treated in anaerobic reactors, or used to \nproduce yeast, animal food and employed in the \ncivil construction.  In relation to the use of vinasse \n\nas an amendment to the biodegradation of \npollutants, Prata et al. (2001) evaluated the effects \nof vinasse on the degradation and sorption of the \nherbicide ametryne. The vinasse addition \nincreased the microbial activity and the \ndegradation of ametryne, and the sorption was not \naffected. Crivelaro (2005) reported an increase in \nthe microbial population, mainly fungi, when \nstudying the use of vinasse as an amendment to \naccelerate the biodegradation of oily sludge in soil. \nAiming to offer an alternative of destination for \nthe vinasse, this work investigated the possibility \nof using vinasse as an amendment in ex-situ \nbioremediation processes by supplying the \nnutrients and as an extra labile carbon source that \ncould increase the microorganisms population. As \nvinasse represents a potential source of pollution, \nex-situ treatments are preferable since controlled \nprocesses minimize any risk of additional \ncontamination due to the vinasse.  \n\n \n \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\nVinasse characteristics \nVinasse was collected at the Santa L\u00facia usine \n(Araras-SP, Brazil) and stored frozen until its use. \nThe physicochemical analyses described in Table \n1 were performed by Icasa laboratory (Instituto \nCampineiro de An\u00e1lise de Solo e Adubo \u2013 Icasa), \naccording to the methodology proposed by \nEmbrapa (1997), and the following parameters: \ndissolved oxygen (DO) (Digimed DM4), chemical \noxygen demand (COD) (Cetesb, 1994), redox \npotential (Eh) (Hanna HI 8314) and conductivity \n(Analion C-701, electrode Analion C 801-1) were \ndetermined at Unesp (Rio Claro-SP, Brazil). \n \nSoil respirometric test \nSoil samples were collected at three petrol \nstations. At the petrol stations ASP and SB, diesel \noil spills occurred from underground storage tanks \napproximately ten years ago and samples were \ncontaminated with diesel oil. At these locations, \nsamples were collected from the capillary fringe \n(depth: ASP - 1.60 m; SB - 2.60 m). At the third \npetrol station (RC), the sample was collected at \n0.50 m during the replacement of underground \npipes. This sample showed low level of \ncontamination by unknown fuel, possibly due to \nleaks in the pipes and ground infiltrations.

Values of heavy metals concentrations \nwere not above the more restricted levels set by \nthe Cetesb (S\u00e3o Paulo Environmental Agency - \nBrazil) and by the Dutch list (Cetesb, 2005a). \nThe physicochemical analyses were performed by \nIcasa laboratory according to the methodology \nproposed by Embrapa (1997), except the following \nparameters: total nitrogen (laboratory \n\n\u201cPIRASOLO \u2013 Laborat\u00f3rio Agrot\u00e9cnico \nPiracicaba\u201d, according to Embrapa (1997)); grain \nsize distribution (ABNT, 1984) and the moisture \ncontent (obtained by the oven drying method). \nDetermination of the total petroleum hydrocarbons \n(TPH) content was carried out by the \u201cAnalytical \nTechnology\u201d laboratory by gas chromatography \nwith the flame ionization detector (FID) according \nto the US Environmental Protection Agency \n(USEPA) methodology SW-846/8015. \n\n \nTable 1 - Vinasse characteristics \nN  % 0.22 Al ppm 72.50 \ntotal P (P2O5) ppm 65.00 Ba ppm 0.54 \nK  K2O % 0.32 Cd ppm 1.06 \nCa  ppm 740.00 Cr ppm 0.15 \nMg ppm 210.00 Ni ppm 0.26 \nS  ppm 835.00 Pb ppm -a \nFe ppm 97.50 organic matter % 3.96 \nMn ppm -a C/N ratio  10.00 \nCu ppm -a density g.mL-1 1.00 \nZn ppm 7.50 pH  3.85 \nB ppm 5.00 OD mg.L-1 4.3 \nNa ppm 113.00 COD mg.L-1 32000 \nCo ppm -a Eh mV 260 \nMo ppm 2.00 conductivity mS 8.52 \n\na not detected. \n \n\n \nTable 2 - Soil samples characteristics \n ASP SB RC \npH (CaCl2) 6.7 5.0 6.7 \nmoisture content (%) 16.6 17.6 8.8 \norganic carbon (%) 1.39 0.99 0.29 \ntotal nitrogen (%) 0.08 0.07 0.02 \navailable phosphorus (ppm)  6.0 3.0 2.0 \nC:N:P ratio 100 : 5.75 : 0.043 100 : 7.08 : 0.03 100 : 6.89 : 0.10 \n (mmolc.dm-3) \nK 1.7 1.4 1.1 \nCa 100 20 15 \nMg 8 6 2 \nH+Al 11 16 10 \nAl -a -a -a \nCECb 121.8 44.1 28.7 \ngrain size distribution  (%)   \nsand 78.7 66.7 81.4 \nsilt 16.3 18.3 7.3 \nclay 5.0 15.0 11.3 \n\n micronutrients (ppm)  heavy metals (ppm) \n\n S Na Fe Mn Cu Zn B Co Mo  Ba Cd Cr Ni Pb \n\nASP 24 24 136 9.4 1.6 1.7 0.24 -a 0.03 9.73 0.03 2.10 0.44 5.9 \nSB 14 17 150 49.1 1.1 2.2 0.21 2.29 -a 55.81 0.19 4.92 1.53 7.96 \nRC 12 13 19 3.0 0.6 7.3 0.15 0.56 -a 4.06 0.12 9.93 0.30 7.10 \n\na not detected \nb cation exchange capacity \n \n\n\n\n \n\nBraz.

Mineralization studies involving \nmeasurements of total CO2 production can provide \nexcellent information on the biodegradability \npotential of hydrocarbons (Balba et al., 1998). \nThe experiments were divided into two parts \ndescribed in Table 3. In the first one, a diesel oil \n\ncontamination of the RC soil was simulated by \nadding diesel oil purchased from a local petrol \nstation or a weathered diesel oil collected from the \ngroundwater at ASP petrol station (6 mg.Kg-1 of \nsoil). In the second part, experiments with ASP \nand SB soils were carried out. For both the parts, \nvinasse was added at a concentration of 33  \nmL.Kg-1 of soil, which changed the water content \nof the soils to 11.9 (RC), 19.0 (ASP) and 19.0 % \n(SB). In the treatments where vinasse was not \nadded (controls), the water content was corrected \nin relation to the other treatments by adding \ndistilled water. \n\n \nTable 3 - Soil respirometric - experimental conditions \n\ntreatment soil experimental condition \n1 RC soil (control) \n2 RC soil + vinasse (control) \n3 RC soil + weathered diesel \n4 RC soil + weathered diesel + vinasse \n5 RC soil + commercial diesel \n6 RC soil + commercial diesel + vinasse \n7 ASP soil (control) \n8 ASP soil + vinasse \n9 SB soil (control) \n\n10 SB soil + vinasse \n \n \nFor each experimental condition, the biometer \nflasks were prepared in triplicates (3 x 50 g of soil) \nand incubated at 27 oC in the dark. The CO2 \nproduced was trapped in a 10.0 mL solution of \nKOH (0.2 N), located in the side-arm of the \nbiometer. This solution was periodically \nwithdrawn by syringe, and the amount of carbon \ndioxide absorbed was then measured by titrating \nthe residual KOH (after the addition of barium \nchloride solution (1 mL; 1.0 N) used to precipitate \nthe carbonate ions) with a standard solution of HCl \n(0.1 N). During this procedure, the biometers were \naerated during 1.5 minute through the ascarite \nfilters. \nAt the end of the experiments, replicates of each \ntreatment were thoroughly mixed together for \nphysicochemical and microbiological analyses. \nTotal heterotrophic bacteria were counted by using \nthe pour plate technique on plate count agar \n(Acumedia, USA). Plate count of the bacterial soil \npopulation was performed as follows: samples of 1 \ng of soil were added to 9 mL of 0.85 % sterile \nsaline solution in test tubes and agitated \nmechanically for 2 minutes. After appropriate \nserial dilutions, 1 mL of the suspension were \nspread over the surface of duplicate petri dishes \n\nand incubated at 35 oC for 48 h. The total \nheterotrophic bacteria count was carried out at the \nbeginning and at end of the respirometric \nexperiments. \n \nGroundwater experiments \nGroundwater samples were collected at petrol \nstations ASP and SB (Mariano et al., 2007b) and \nstored at 5 oC until the biodegradation experiments \nwere performed. In order to verify the influence of \nthe addition of vinasse in the biodegradation of the \ndiesel oil present in the groundwater, two \nbiodegradation experiments were set up. The first \nwas carried out in BOD flasks (300 mL) that were \nincubated in the dark during 20 days at 20.0\u00b10.2 \noC. Treatments with vinasse were compared to a \nstandard bioremediation technique, the addition of \nnutrients, where the nitrogen and phosphorus \ncorrection was performed using solutions of \n(NH4)2SO4 and KH2PO4, respectively. Table 4 \nsummarizes the experimental conditions. To \nprovide the same conditions to the treatments \nwithout vinasse, 5 % of the reacting medium \nvolume corresponds to distillate water.  \nFor each treatment, six BOD flasks were prepared \nand the following measurements were carried out \n\n\n\nThe Use of Vinasse as an Amendment to Ex-Situ Bioremediation \n\nBraz.

Thus, aiming to \novercome this process deficiency, the second \nbiodegradation experiment was based on an \naerated system. The results obtained with the \naerated bioreactors are shown in Tables 10 and 11. \nTreatments with vinasse had a better performance \nin terms of reduction of the chemical oxygen \ndemand (COD) (Table 10). However, the final \nvalues were still very high (up to 40 times in \n\nrelation to the controls), indicating that even in 20 \ndays the vinasse was not totally biodegraded. \nSimilarly to the BOD flasks experiment, the \naddition of vinasse had a negative influence on the \nbiodegradation of the hydrocarbons, as suggested \nby the final concentrations of benzene (ASP) and \nxylenes (ASP and SB) (Table 11). No influence of \nthe vinasse in the concentration of the \npolyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) could be \nidentified, since most of these values were under \nthe detection limit. \n\n \nTable 10 - Groundwater experiment \u2013 aerated bioreactors \n\n \n \n \n \n\n 0 20 reduction \n \n\ntreatment \nday % \n\n1 41.5 16.3 60.7 \nASP \n\n2 1699 408.2 76.0 \n3 37.8 12.2 67.7 \n\nCOD  \n(mg.L-1) \n\nSB \n4 1888 510.2 73.0 \n\n\n\nThe Use of Vinasse as an Amendment to Ex-Situ Bioremediation \n\nBraz.

Amostras de \n\u00e1gua subterr\u00e2nea e solo foram coletadas em tr\u00eas \npostos de combust\u00edveis. A biorremedia\u00e7\u00e3o do solo \n\nfoi simulada em frascos de Bartha, usados para \nmedir a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de CO2, durante 48 dias, onde a \nvinha\u00e7a foi adicionada a uma concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de 33 \nmL.Kg-1 de solo. A efici\u00eancia de biodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o \ntamb\u00e9m foi medida pela quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o de \nhidrocarbonetos totais de petr\u00f3leo (TPH) por \ncromatografia gasosa. A biorremedia\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00e1gua \nsubterr\u00e2nea foi realizada em experimentos \nlaboratoriais simulando condi\u00e7\u00f5es aeradas \n(bioreatores) e n\u00e3o aeradas (frascos de DBO). Em \nambos os casos, a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de vinha\u00e7a foi de \n5 % (v/v) e diferentes par\u00e2metros f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmicos \nforam avaliados durante 20 dias. Embora um \naumento da fertiliza\u00e7\u00e3o e da popula\u00e7\u00e3o microbiana \ndo solo foram obtidos com a vinha\u00e7a, esta \nestrat\u00e9gia n\u00e3o se mostrou adequada em aumentar a \nefici\u00eancia da biorremedia\u00e7\u00e3o dos solos \ncontaminados com \u00f3leo diesel.
