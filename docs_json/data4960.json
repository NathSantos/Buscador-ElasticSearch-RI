The greatest acknowledgement of all is to God Almighty the \n\nsource of wisdom, strength, and knowledge for seeing me through another step in my \n\nacademic career.  To HIM alone is all the glory for my wonderful yesterdays, the blessings \n\nof today, and the promises of my future. Great is THY faithfulness, morning by morning \n\nnew mercies I see! I give thanks to the LORD for everything.    \n\nI humbly appreciate the role of my late father, Pa John Ademolaju Adeyemo for \n\nlaunching me into this academic orbit at a tender age. He was fulfilled in me. Though he \n\npassed on, the legacy he left for me remains. May he continue to rest in the bosom of our \n\nLord Jesus Christ. Amen. I owe an indescribable indebtedness to my mother, Madam \n\nEunice Ayodele Adeyemo, who took the challenge, washed my infant head with tears and \n\naffection during vicissitudes and travails of my life. She actually jump-started my \n\neducation and that of my siblings in our humble, united but polygamous family setting. \n\nYou are indeed a great mother! Thanks to my family, the bone of my bone \u2013 Funmilayo \n\nKemisola Thaddeus Adeyemo, and David Adebayo Adeyemo junior, who always put \n\nsmiles on my face when I thought everything was falling apart. Thank you for always \n\npushing me to achieve my full potential. I have been very blessed. I assure you that all the \n\nmoney spent was invested in the genuine pursuit of academic knowledge, save for a \n\nminimal amount set aside for general sustenance and the occasional replacement of worn \n\nsandals. \n\nI would like to extend my thanks to those who have contributed their knowledge \n\nand support over the past years. This doctoral thesis would not have been possible without \n\nthe scholarship given by The World Academy of Sciences and The Brazilian National \n\nCouncil for Scientific and Technological Development (TWAS/CNPq), I also thank The \n\n\n\niv \n\n \n\nTWAS Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean (TWAS-ROLAC) in Rio de \n\nJaneiro, Brazil for their support during international conferences I attended in both France \n\nand Egypt in the course of seeking for knowledge during my doctoral program.  \n\nThe intelligence and expert guidance of Professor (Dr.) Jaime Wilson Vargas de \n\nMello, and my co-supervisors \u2013 Professor (Dr.) Ivo Ribeiro da Silva, Professor (Dr.) \n\nSergio Antonio Fernandes and other colleagues in the Department will highly be \n\nappreciated. Many thanks to Foundation Arthur Bernandes (FURNARBE) for their \n\ncontribution in purchasing laboratory items; the Department of Soil Science, Federal \n\nUniversity of Vi\u00e7osa for the support given to attend the Eighth International Conference \n\non Remediation of Chlorinated and Recalcitrant Compounds (Monterey, CA, United State \n\nof America), where part of my doctoral work was presented. I appreciate the cordial \n\nrelationship I had with all the Departmental staff, including our highly revered Professor \n\nNairam F\u00e9lix de Barros. I am grateful to Professor Liovando Marciano da Costa for his \n\nadvice and help always, also to the rest of the professors in the Department who did the \n\nbest they could; your effort is so greatly appreciated, they have all at one time or the other \n\ncontributed to my academic life in this University. My sincere appreciation also goes to the \n\nentire University community for creating a research and enabling environments for \n\nstudents to acquire knowledge. \n\nTo all who gave encouragement to go ahead with this work, especially my dear \n\nfriend and my confidant - Pollyanna Pereira Santos, who painstakingly correct my \n\nPortuguese language all the time, thereby making Brazil to be friendlier, you are highly \n\nappreciated! All the authors whose works are hereby cited are duly acknowledged for their \n\ncontributions to the body of knowledge to solve the used lubricating oil pollution \n\nchallenges in our respective environments. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBIOGRAPHY \n\n \n\n \n\n  ADEBAYO JONATHAN ADEYEMO, son of John Ademolaju Adeyemo and \n\nEunice Ayodeji Adeyemo was born on 11th of July, 1979, in Aramoko Ekiti, Ekiti State, \n\nNigeria.

Adviser: Jaime \nWilson Vargas de Mello. Co-advisors: Ivo Ribeiro da Silva and Sergio Antonio Fernandes. \n\n \n\nOil is the most widely distributed source of energy in the world and the largest-scaled \n\nenvironmental pollutant. Oil, oil products, and oil-containing industrial wastes pollution is \n\nranked second place after radioactive pollution on account of their harmful action to \n\necosystems. Contamination of soil by organic chemicals (mostly hydrocarbons) is prevalent in \n\noil producing and industrialized countries of the world. This may pose a great threat to the \n\nenvironment and human being at large. Different treatment methods have been employed to \n\nremediate contaminated soils. Bioremediation, a strategy that uses biological means to \n\ndegrade, stabilize, and/or remove soil contaminants can be an alternative green technology for \n\nremediation of hydrocarbon-contaminated soil.   Bioremediation provides an economically \n\nbeneficial and highly-specific clean-up technology to remove pollutants by targeting \n\nindividual compounds or their mixtures. The planning of bioremediation strategies for \n\npolluted land and water areas should consider the use of the existing indigenous oil oxidizing \n\nmicroorganisms with different affinity to oil fractions and their activation by addition of \n\nfertilizers (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium). The inoculation of effective microorganisms \n\nsuch as amnite p1300, special bacteria strains consisting a mixture of Bacillus subtilis, \n\nBacillus megaterium, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Phanerochaete \n\nchrysosporium, Rhodococcus rhodocrous on a cereal (bran) among others possess significant \n\npollutant degradation potential. It has been shown that these bacteria can use recalcitrant \n\npollutant as energy source. The remediation of polluted soils requires the study of the \n\nmicroorganisms\u2019 diversity in the environment and the determination of the ability of different \n\nmicrobes and their consortia to degrade pollutants in the presence of high oil pollution \n\nconcentration. This is important because it has been observed that the introduction of a single \n\noil-oxidizing strain into the oil-spilled environment does not assure a complete clean-up. This \n\ninvestigation consists of studies with the primary aim of studying the efficacy of commercial \n\nbacterial strains for the biodegradation of used lubricating oil in soil. The rates of \n\nbiodegradation of the used lubricating oil were studied in the laboratory. The model soil \n\n\n\nxiii \n\n \n\nsample of 300 g was contaminated with 1.5, 3.0 and 4.5 % (w/w) of used motor oil at room \n\ntemperature under laboratory conditions using microcosm of 1 L. The microcosm  was used to \n\nsimulate the comparative effect of spent oil addition and bioremediation using a commercially \n\navailable hydrocarbon degrading microbial consortium (Amnite P1300) as the \n\nbioaugmentation treatment, to enhance biodegradation of hydrocarbons in soils contaminated \n\nwith different concentrations of used lubricating oil, nutrients amendments ((NH4)2SO4 and \n\nK2HPO4) as biostimulation, unammended soil (natural attenuation) and the control soil treated \n\nwith sodium azide (NaN3) on the microbial community in different soil  types. Hydrocarbon-\n\nutilizing bacterial counts were high in the amended soils with commercial bacterial, nutrients \n\namendments and the natural attenuation (soil alone) compared to control soil treated with \n\nsodium azide throughout the period of the study. Oil-contaminated soil amended with Amnite \n\nP1300 showed the highest reduction in total petroleum hydrocarbon in all the contamination \n\nlevels compared to other treatments in all the soil types. The evaluation of soil biological \n\nactivities as a monitoring tool for the degradation process of the model soils was made via \n\nmeasurements of hydrocarbons degrading bacterial counts (HDB), soil respiration (CO2), pH \n\nand percentage oil degradation. The correlations between these parameters and the levels of \n\nthe hydrocarbon residues were determined. The residual hydrocarbon content correlated \n\nnegatively with hydrocarbon utilizers, CO2 evolution, pH and percentage (%) oil degradation \n\n(P &lt;0.01) in the clayey and sandy soils. Complete biodegradation of C10 to C14 and substantial \n\ndegradation of C15 to C28 hydrocarbon fractions and PAHs were recorded in Amnite P1300 \n\namended soils throughout the period of study, thus suggesting the high potential of the \n\nproduct in enhancing biodegradation of hydrocarbons. The results revealed remediation \n\npotential of Amnite p1300 to degrade heavy hydrocarbons in used lubricating oil. It is \n\nconcluded that contamination of soil with oil hydrocarbons has a negative effect on soil \n\necosystems, and the extent and duration of these effects will depend on the nature of the \n\nhydrocarbon contaminant and the soil characteristics. Thus, inhibitory effect of used \n\nlubricating oil is more pronounced in sandy soil than clayey soil and show more toxic effect \n\non seed germination and root growth. \n\n\n\n \n\nxiv \n\n \n\nRESUMO \n\nADEYEMO, Adebayo Jonathan, D.Sc., Universidade Federal de Vi\u00e7osa, fevereiro de 2013. \nBiorremedia\u00e7\u00e3o de solos brasileiros contaminado com \u00f3leo lubrificante usado.

Petr\u00f3leos, derivados de petr\u00f3leo e os res\u00edduos industriais que \n\ncont\u00eam petr\u00f3leo, ocupam o segundo lugar entre os poluentes, perdendo apenas para a polui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nradioativa no que se refere a danos causados aos ecossistemas. A contamina\u00e7\u00e3o dos solos por \n\ncompostos org\u00e2nicos, principalmente hidrocarbonetos, \u00e9 comum entre os pa\u00edses que \n\nproduzem e industrializam petr\u00f3leo, representando grande amea\u00e7a ao homem e ao meio \n\nambiente em geral. Diferentes m\u00e9todos de tratamento t\u00eam sido empregados para eliminar a \n\ncontamina\u00e7\u00e3o dos solos. A biorremedia\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 uma estrat\u00e9gia que usa meios biol\u00f3gicos para \n\ndegradar, estabilizar e/ou remover contaminantes do solo, sendo tecnologia \u00b4\u00b4verde\u00b4\u00b4 \n\nalternativa na remedia\u00e7\u00e3o de solos contaminados com hidrocarbonetos. A biorremedia\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nfornece benef\u00edcios econ\u00f4micos e de alta tecnologia para remover concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de poluentes, \n\nsejam eles individuais ou misturas. O planejamento de estrat\u00e9gias de biorremedia\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nambiente terrestres e aqu\u00e1ticos contaminados tem por base a exist\u00eancia de microrganismos \n\nnaturais que degradam petr\u00f3leo com diferentes afinidades pelas fra\u00e7\u00f5es, fertilizantes \n\n(nitrog\u00eanio, f\u00f3sforo e pot\u00e1ssio). Amnite p1300, o qual consiste de mistura de bacterianas de \n\nBacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens, \n\nPhanerochaete chrysosporium, Rhodococcus rhodocrous em cereais (farelo), entre outros \n\npossui significativo potencial de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o de poluentes. Tem sido demonstrado que essas \n\nbact\u00e9rias podem usar poluentes recalcitrantes como fonte de energia. A remedia\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\npoluentes dos solos requer o estudo da diversidade desses microrganismos no ambiente e a \n\ndetermina\u00e7\u00e3o da capacidade de diferentes microorganismos e seus diferentes agrupamentos \n\npara degradar poluentes na presen\u00e7a de elevadas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de polui\u00e7\u00e3o por petr\u00f3leo. Isto \n\n\u00e9 importante porque tem sido observado que a introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de uma simples cerpa oxidante de \n\npetr\u00f3leo em ambiente contaminado n\u00e3o assegura limpeza por completo. Este trabalho teve \n\ncomo objetivo principal investigar a efici\u00eancia de um produto comercial na biodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\n\u00f3leos lubrificantes usados presentes no solo. A taxa de  biodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o de res\u00edduos de \u00f3leo \n\n\n\n \n\nxv \n\n \n\nlubrificante foi estudada em laborat\u00f3rio. Uma amostra de solo modelo de 300 g foi \n\ncontaminado com 1,5, 3,0 e 4,5 % (w/w) de \u00f3leo de motor usado \u00e0 temperatura ambiente em \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es laboratoriais usando microcosmo de 1L. O microcosmo foi usado para simular o \n\nefeito comparativo da adi\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00f3leo usado e a bioremedia\u00e7\u00e3o usando um coquetel \n\nmicrobiano dispon\u00edvel comercialmente que degrada hidrocarbonetos (Amnite p1300) como o \n\ntratamento de crescimento microbiano, para elevar a biodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o de hidrocarbonetos em \n\nsolos contaminados com diferentes concentra\u00e7\u00f5es, adi\u00e7\u00e3o de nutrientes (NH4)2SO4 e K2HPO4) \n\ncomo tratamento de bioestimula\u00e7\u00e3o, atenua\u00e7\u00e3o natural e o solo controle tratado com azida de \n\ns\u00f3dio (NaN3) sobre a  comunidade microbiana em diferentes tipos de solos. A contagem de \n\nbact\u00e9rias que utilizam hidrocarboneto foi elevada nos solos tratados com a mistura de \n\nbact\u00e9rias comercial, com adi\u00e7\u00e3o de nutrientes e na atenua\u00e7\u00e3o natural (apenas solo) comparado \n\ncom o solo controle tratado com azida de s\u00f3dio durante o per\u00edodo do estudo. Os solos \n\ncontaminados com petr\u00f3leo e adicionadas de Aminte P1300 mostraram elevada redu\u00e7\u00e3o no \n\ntotal de hidrocarbonetos de petr\u00f3leo em todos os n\u00edveis de contamina\u00e7\u00e3o quando comparado \n\ncom outros tratamentos em todos os tipos de solos. A avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da atividade biol\u00f3gica do solo \n\ncomo instrumento para monitorar o processo de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o dos solos modelos foi feita \n\natrav\u00e9s da contagem das bact\u00e9rias degradadoras de hidrocarbonetos (HDB), atividades \n\nbiol\u00f3gica como (CO2),  pH e porcentagem de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o do \u00f3leo. A correla\u00e7\u00e3o entre estes \n\npar\u00e2metros e o n\u00edvel de res\u00edduos de hidrocarbonetos foi determinada.  O conte\u00fado \n\nhidrocarboneto res\u00edduos correlacionou se negativamente com hidrocarbonetos utilizados, \n\nevolu\u00e7\u00e3o de CO2,  pH e porcentagem de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00f3leo (P &lt;0,01). nos solos argilosos e \n\narenosos. A completa biodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o de C10-C14 e a degrada\u00e7\u00e3o substancial de C15-C28 das \n\nfra\u00e7\u00f5es de hidrocarbonetos e PAHs foi registrada com o tratamento de adi\u00e7\u00e3o de Amnite \n\nP1300 nos solos alterados durante o per\u00edodo do estudo. Sugerindo assim elevado potencial do \n\nproduto em aumentar a biodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o de hidrocarbonetos. Os resultados revelaram o \n\npotencial de remedia\u00e7\u00e3o de Amnite p1300 na degrada\u00e7\u00e3o de hidrocarbonetos de cadeia longa, \n\ncomo os \u00f3leos lubrificantes usados. Conclu\u00edmos que a contamina\u00e7\u00e3o de solos com \n\nhidrocarbonetos tem efeito negativo no solo, e a extens\u00e3o e dura\u00e7\u00e3o desses efeitos vai \n\ndepender da natureza dos hidrocarbonetos contaminantes e das caracter\u00edsticas do solo. \n\nEntretanto, o efeito inibit\u00f3rio dos \u00f3leos lubrificantes usado \u00e9 mais pronunciado em solos \n\narenosos do que em solos argilosos e tem efeito t\u00f3xico na germina\u00e7\u00e3o de sementes e \n\ncrescimento de ra\u00edzes. \n\n\n\n \n\n1 \n\n \n\n1. INTRODUCTION \n \n\n1.1. Background.  \n\nPetroleum and its refined products (gasoline, diesel, kerosene, engine oil, jet fuel, etc.) \n\nare major resources used for energy requirements in industrial and transportation sectors \n\nthroughout the world. The lubricating oils represent approximately 2 % of the derivatives of \n\npetroleum oil and are used for automotive and industrial purposes. According to their \n\napplications, they receive additives (organic and / or inorganic) in their formulation in order to \n\nmeet the requirements of the different intended applications (ANP, 1999; CEMPRE, 2007). \n\nMotor oil is used for lubrication requirements of various kinds of automotive and other \n\nengines. During these types of uses, motor oil picks up a number of additional components \n\nfrom engine wear. These include heavy metals, such as lead, chromium, cadmium, and other \n\nmaterials like naphthalene, chlorinated hydrocarbons, sulphur. After the passage of time, oil \n\nchanges become necessary due to alteration in the viscosity of the oil. Any such oil that \n\nbecomes unsuitable after use due to contamination, making it unfit for its original purpose, is \n\nknown as used motor oil (U.M.O) and is required to be suitably disposed of. Thus, any \n\ndisposal of used oil in soils, surface water and groundwater, sewer systems and waste water \n\ndisposal or any form of elimination that causes air pollution exceeding the level set by the \n\nenvironmental protection legislation is forbidden (ABNT, 1987; CETESB, 2003; CONAMA, \n\n2005).  \n\nThe base oil contains C16-C36 hydrocarbons, and more than 75% c-alkanes. The rings \n\nnumber of c-alkanes in the base oil is from 1 to 3 and any ring contains 5 or 6 members. Most \n\nof the c-alkanes in the base oil have long alkyl side chains (Koma et al., 2003). The most \n\nimportant characteristic of the lubricating oil for automotive use is its viscosity. Fresh motor \n\noil contains a higher percentage of volatile and water soluble hydrocarbons that would be a \n\nconcern for acute toxicity to organisms (Boonchan et al., 2000). Used motor oil contains \n\nmetals and heavy polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that could contribute to chronic \n\nhazards including mutagenicity and carcinogenicity (Hagwell et al., 1992; Boonchan et al., \n\n2000). As the usage of petroleum hydrocarbon products increased, soil contamination with \n\ndiesel and engine oils is becoming one of the major environmental problems (Mandri and Lin, \n\n2007). Prolonged exposure to high oil concentration may cause the development of liver or \n\n\n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\nkidney disease, possible damage to the bone marrow and an increased risk of cancer (Mishra \n\net al., 2001; Propst et al., 1999, Lloyd and Cackette, 2001).  In addition, PAHs have a \n\nwidespread occurrence in various ecosystems that contribute to the persistence of these \n\ncompounds in the environment (Van Hamme et al., 2003). The illegal dumping of used motor \n\noil is an environmental hazard with global ramifications (Blodgett, 2001). Used oils have the \n\npotential to be recycled and re-refined if safely and properly collected, yet in many cases it is \n\npoured into an open drain or thrown into the trash where it can contaminate the subsurface \n\nsoil and ground water. In Africa and some developing countries about 20 million gallons of \n\nwaste engine oil are generated annually from mechanic workshops and discharged carelessly \n\ninto the environment (Faboya, 1997; Adegoroye, 1997). Out of which only one liter is enough \n\nto contaminate one million gallons of freshwater and create a film that prevents aeration in \n\napproximately one thousand square meters of a water body, causing serious damage to fauna \n\nand aquatic flora. (USEPA, 1996, Viveiros, 2000; Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2007). Apart from this, \n\nused engine oil renders the environment unsightly and constitutes a potential threat to \n\nhumans, animals and vegetation (ATSDR, 1997; Edewor et al., 2004; Adelowo et al., 2006). \n\nA single automotive oil change is estimated to produce 4\u20135 L of used oil. The bulk of U.M.O \n\ngenerated in India (about 0.4 million tons (1 ton = 0.907 t) annually) generally goes into \n\nundesirable applications and only a very small amount (10 tons annually) is currently re-\n\nrefined (IIP 1997). A large number of roadside garages drain used oils from automobile \n\nengines and there is no record of the next destination of such oils. Major oil-contaminated \n\nspots reported are Meethi River at Kurla (Mumbai) and in the Mundka and Rohtak road area \n\nnear New Delhi (India) (IIP 1997). In the United States, about 500 million gallons of used oil \n\nare being disposed indiscriminately every year (Anoliefo and Vwioko 1995: Adesodun and \n\nMbagwu, 2008). Likewise, about 0.1 million tons of U.M.O is reported to be wasted annually \n\nin Australia (Kemp 2004).  \n\nIn Brazil, the production of lubricating oils is approximately one billion liters/year \n\n(Conselho em Revista 2005; Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2007). Of this amount, about 650 million \n\nliters/year are consumed by vehicles or other uses, in other words, they are not recoverable. \n\nOf the remaining 350 million liters/year used, which are not consumed completely in the \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nprocess, 69.2 % is recycled via re- refining, or about 240 million liters /year. Data \n\nfrom 2004 show that in that year approximately 240 million liters were collected i.e., around \n\n24.0 % of the lubricating oil marketed in the country. The volume of used oil collected in \n\n2004, enabled the processing of approximately 170 million liters of re-refined base oil \n\n(Magalh\u00e3es et al. 2007; CEMPRE, 2007). This waste-oil usually contains appreciable \n\namounts of toxic hydrocarbons and heavy metals such as V, Pb, Al, Ni, Fe, Cr and Zn \n\n(Whisman et al., 1974).   \n\n \n\nTable 1.

It is observed in table 1 above that Brazil has the \n\nhighest rate of percentage ratio of the volume of oil recovered through recycling process to \n\nthe volume of used oil residue, RRP/UOR = 69 % . This result shows that among Latin \n\nAmerican countries cited in 2001, Brazil had the largest volume of recycled waste oil, but \n\nstill, the volume of 120 million litres/year presented is considerably high in waste oil \n\nrecovered through unknown process (RUP). Probably the RUP is associated with improper \n\nburning of these residues. \n\n \n\n1.2. Chemistry of petroleum hydrocarbon.  \nPetroleum is defined as any mixture of natural gas, condensate, and crude oil. Crude \n\noil  which is a heterogeneous liquid consisting of hydrocarbons comprised almost entirely of \n\nthe elements hydrogen and carbon in the ratio of about 2 hydrogen atoms to 1 carbon atom \n\n(Okoh, 2006). It also contains elements such as N, S, and O, all of which constitute less than \n\n3% (v/v). There are also trace constituents, comprising less than 1% (v/v), including P and \n\nheavy metals such as V and Ni. Crude oils could be classified according to their respective \n\ndistillation residues as paraffins, naphthenes or aromatics and based on the relative \n\nproportions of the heavy molecular weight constituents as light, medium or heavy. Also, the \n\ncomposition of crudes may vary with the location and age of an oil field, and may even be \n\ndepth dependent within an individual well. About 85% of the components of all types of \n\ncrude oil can be classified as either asphalt base, paraffin base or mixed base. Asphalt base \n\ncontain little paraffin wax and an asphaltic residue (Atlas, 1981). The S, O and N contents are \n\noften relatively higher in comparison with paraffin base crudes, which contain little or no \n\nasphaltic materials. Mixed crude oil contains considerable amount of oxides of N and asphalt.  \n\nPetroleum oil biodegradation by bacteria can occur under both oxic and anoxic \n\nconditions (Zengler et al., 1999), albeit by the action of different consortia of organisms. In \n\nthe subsurface, oil biodegradation occurs primarily under anoxic conditions, mediated by \n\nsulfate reducing bacteria (Holba et al., 1996) or other anaerobes using a variety of other \n\nelectron acceptors as the oxidant. On a structural basis, the hydrocarbons in crude oil are \n\nclassified as alkanes (normal or iso), cycloalkanes, and aromatics. Alkenes, which are the \n\nunsaturated analogs of alkanes, are rare in crude oil but occur in many refined petroleum \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nproducts as a consequence of the cracking process. Increasing carbon numbers of alkanes \n\n(homology), variations in carbon chain branching (iso-alkanes), ring condensations, and \n\ninterclass combinations e.g., phenylalkanes, account for the high numbers of hydrocarbons \n\nthat occur in crude oil. In addition, smaller amounts of O \u2013 (phenols, naphthenic acids), N - \n\n(pyridine, pyrrole, indole), and S - (alkylthiol, thiophene) containing compounds, collectively \n\ndesignated as \u201cresins\u201d and partially oxygenated, highly condensed asphaltic fraction occur \n\nalso in crude but not in refined petroleum (Atlas and Bartha, 1973).  \n\nThe inherent biodegradability of these individual components is a reflection of their \n\nchemical structure, but is also strongly influenced by the physical state and toxicity of the \n\ncompounds. As an example, while nalkanes as a structural group are the most biodegradable \n\npetroleum hydrocarbons, the C5 \u2013 C10 homologues have been shown to be inhibitory to the \n\nmajority of hydrocarbon degraders. As solvents, these homologues tend to disrupt lipid \n\nmembrane structures of microorganisms. Similarly, alkanes in the C20 \u2013 C40 range, often \n\nreferred to as \u201cwaxes\u201d, are hydrophobic solids at physiological temperatures. Apparently, it is \n\nthis physical state that strongly influences their biodegradation (Bartha and Atlas, 1977). \n\nPrimary attack on intact hydrocarbons always requires the action of oxygenases and, \n\ntherefore, requires the presence of free O. In the case of alkanes, monooxygenase attack \n\nresults in the production of alcohol. Most microorganisms attack alkanes terminally whereas \n\nsome perform sub-terminal oxidation (Figure 1). The alcohol product is oxidised into an \n\naldehyde and finally, to a fatty acid. The latter is degraded further by beta-oxidation. \n\nExtensive methyl branching interferes with the beta oxidation process and necessitates di \n\nterminal attack (Figure 2) or other bypass mechanisms. Therefore, nalkanes are degraded \n\nmore readily than iso alkanes. \n\nCycloalkanes are transformed by a not fully characterized oxidase system to a \n\ncorresponding cyclic alcohol, which is dehydrated to ketone. Then, a monooxygenase system \n\nlactonises the ring, which is subsequently opened by a lactone hydrolase. These two \n\noxygenase systems usually never occur in the same organisms and hence, the frustrated \n\nattempts to isolate pure cultures that grow on cycloalkanes (Bartha 1986b). However, \n\nsynergistic actions of microbial communities are capable of dealing with degradation of \n\nvarious cycloalkanes quite effectively. As in the case of alkanes, the monocyclic compounds,  \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n Fig. 1: Pathways, through which sub terminal oxidation of alkanes  yield two fatty acid \nmoieties, which are metabolized further by beta-oxidation (Atlas and Bartha, 1998). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\ncyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane have a strong solvent effect on lipid \n\nmembranes, and are toxic to the majority of hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms. \n\nHighly condensed cycloalkane compounds resist biodegradation due to their structure and \n\nphysical state (Bartha, 1986a). \n\nProkaryotes convert aromatic hydrocarbons by an initial dioxygenase attack, to \n\ntransdihydrodiols that are further oxidised to dihydroxy products, e.g., catechol in the case \n\nof benzene (Atlas and Bartha, 1998). Eucaryotic microorganisms use monooxygenases, \n\nproducing benzene 1, 2-oxide from benzene, followed by the addition of water, yielding \n\ndihydroxydihydrobenzene (cis-dihydrodiol). This is oxidised in turn to catechol, a key \n\nintermediate in biodegradation of aromatics, which is then opened by ortho- or \n\nmetacleavage, yielding muconic acid or 2- hydroxymuconic semialdehyde, respectively. \n\nCondensed polycyclic aromatics are degraded, one ring at a time, by a similar \n\nmechanism, but biodegradability tend to decline with the increasing number of rings and \n\ndegree of condensation (Atlas and Bartha, 1998). Aromatics with more than four condensed \n\nrings are generally not suitable as substrates for microbial growth, though, they may \n\nundergo metabolic transformations. Biodegradation process also declines with the \n\nincreasing number of alkyl substituent on the aromatic nucleus. Asphaltic tend to increase \n\nduring biodegradation in relative and sometimes absolute amounts. This would suggest that \n\nthey not only tend to resist biodegradation but may also be formed from beginning by \n\ncondensation reactions of biodegradation and photodegradation intermediates. In crude \n\npetroleum as well as in refined products, petroleum hydrocarbons occur in complex \n\nmixtures and influence each other\u2019s biodegradation. The effects may go in negative as well \n\nas positive directions. Some isoalkanes are apparently spared as long as nalkanes are \n\navailable as substrates, while some condensed aromatics are metabolized only in the \n\npresence of more easily utilizable petroleum hydrocarbons, a process referred to as co-\n\nmetabolism (Wackett, 1996). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \nFig. 2: Pathway of diterminal alkane oxidation (Atlas, 1984) \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n1.3. Effects of used lubricating oil on human health.  \nMineral-based crankcase oils are manufactured using highly refined base oils and \n\ncontain up to 20% of a variety of additives such as viscosity index improvers, \n\ndetergents/dispersants, antiwear additives, pour-point depressants, and antioxidants (IARC \n\n1984; Kirk-Othmer 1981). During use, the high temperatures and friction cause changes such \n\nas oxidation, nitration, and cracking of polymers in the component chemicals (Vazquez-\n\nDuhalt 1989). In addition, a variety of substances such as fuel, water, antifreeze, dust, and \n\nvarious combustion products such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), metals, and \n\nmetallic oxides accumulate in the oil. The degree of chemical change and accumulation of \n\ncontaminants in the oil increases with use and varies depending on the type of fuel used and \n\nthe mechanical properties of the engine. In an engine lubricating system, the required quantity \n\nof lubricant is transported where it is needed in the engine. The lubricant protects against \n\nwear, reduces friction, cleans the engine of dirt and residue (detergent), protects against \n\ncorrosion, cools the engine, and seals the pistons (Van Donkelaar 1990). Additives are added \n\nto lubricating oils to improve its physical and chemical properties. Consequently, lubricating \n\noils have high additive contents (up to 20%), especially detergents and dispersants which \n\nconstitute 2-15% of oil weight (Vasquez-Duhalt 1989). However, several of the oil additives \n\nare toxic environmental contaminants, e.g., zinc dithiophosphate and zinc diary1 or dialkyl \n\ndithiophosphates (ZDTPs); calcium alkyl phenates; magnesium, sodium, and calcium \n\nsulphonates; tricresyl phosphates; molybdenum disulfide; heavy metal soaps; and other \n\norganometallic compounds that contain heavy metals. Hence, very high levels of zinc and \n\ncadmium are found in new motor oil-approximately 1,500 ?g/g of zinc and 87 ?g/kg of \n\ncadmium (Hewstone 1994a; Vasquez-Duhalt 1989). Although ZDTPs have a low acute \n\nsystemic toxicity, they can cause eye damage and skin irritation (Hewstone 1994a). Prolonged \n\nexposure to high concentrations of ZDTPs, calcium alkyl phenates, and magnesium, sodium, \n\nand calcium sulphonates had significant effects on the reproductive organs of male rabbits \n\n(testicular atrophy and reduction or absence of spermatozoa) which appeared to be species \n\nspecific. The absorption of tricresyl phosphates caused peripheral nervous system damage, \n\nleading to neuromuscular problems (Hewstone 1994a).  \n\nIn a crankcase-lubricated engine, the oil compartment acts as a sink for heavy \n\nmolecular incomplete combustion products such as PAHs and their analogs (Scheepers and \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nBos 1992). Thus, contaminants such as PAHs, which are formed via combustion, can \n\naccumulate in the oil by a factor of up to 1,000. PAHs are known to be highly toxic \n\nenvironmental contaminants with carcinogenic and mutagenic properties. They leave the \n\nengine in various ways, such as via particulates, oil leaks, and uncontrolled oil changes, which \n\nthen accumulates in the environment. One hundred and forty different PAHs have been found \n\nin the used oil of crankcase-lubricated engines. These PAHs are also present in much lower \n\nquantities in new or fresh oil (Van Donkelaar 1990). Used mineral-based crankcase oil is a \n\ncomplex mixture of metals and PAHs. When motor oils undergo thermal decomposition, \n\ngasoline combustion products are formed, significantly increasing the levels of PAHs which \n\ncontribute to the carcinogenic and mutagenic properties of the oils (Bingham 1988; Ingram et \n\nal. 1994). Hence, it is difficult to define the precise composition of used mineral based \n\ncrankcase oil because of the variety of chemical additives that may be present and the varying \n\ndegrees of chemical decomposition and contaminant accumulation.  \n\nAromatics hydrocarbons are considered to be the most acutely toxic component of \n\npetroleum products, and are also associated with chronic and carcinogenic effects (Anderson \n\net al., 1974). Aromatics are often distinguished by the number of rings they possess, which \n\nmay range from one to five (Anderson et al., 1974). Lighter, monoaromatics (one ring) \n\ncompounds include benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX). Aromatics with two \n\nor more rings are referred to as polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Anderson et al., 1974). \n\nUsed lubricating oil contains several toxic components including up to 30% aromatic \n\nhydrocarbons, with as much as 22 ppm benzo(a)pyrene (a PAH). Upshall et al., (1993) \n\nreported that motor oil had a density of 0.828 g/ml and contained 14% aromatics and 65.4% \n\naliphatic (by weight). In their study, the sum of 26 individual PAHs represented 0.17% of the \n\noil, or 1.2% of the aromatic fraction. Chronic effects of naphthalene, a constituent in used \n\nmotor oil, include changes in the liver and harmful effects on the kidneys, heart, lungs, and \n\nnervous system. Due to their relative persistence and potential for various chronic effects (like \n\ncarcinogenicity), PAHs (and particularly the alkyl PAHs) can contribute to long term \n\n(chronic) hazards of jet fuels in contaminated soils, sediments, and groundwater.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n1.4. Bioremediation strategies.  \nThe term bioremediation describes the process of contaminant degradation in the \n\nenvironment by biological methods using the metabolic potential of microorganisms to \n\ndegrade a wide variety of organic compounds (Scragg, 2005). The main advantage of \n\nbioremediation is its reduced cost compared to conventional techniques. Besides cost \n\neffectiveness, it is a permanent solution, which may lead to complete mineralization of the \n\npollutant. Furthermore, it is a non-invasive technique, leaving the ecosystem intact (Perelo, \n\n2010). Bioremediation can deal with lower concentration of contaminants where the cleanup \n\nby physical or chemical methods would not be feasible. The goal of bioremediation is to \n\ndegrade organic pollutants to concentrations that are undetectable, or if detectable, to \n\nconcentrations below the limits established as safe or acceptable by regulatory agencies. \n\nBioremediation has been used for the degradation of chemicals in soils, groundwater, \n\nwastewater, sludge, industrial wastewater systems, and gases (Okoh and Trejo-Hernandez, \n\n2006). For bioremediation to be effective, microorganisms must enzymatically attack the \n\npollutants and convert them to harmless products. As bioremediation can be effective only \n\nwhere environmental conditions permit microbial growth and activity, its application often \n\ninvolves the manipulation of environmental parameters to allow microbial growth and \n\ndegradation to proceed at a faster rate (Vidali, 2001). Potential advantages of bioremediation \n\ncompared to other treatment methods include destruction rather than transfer of the \n\ncontaminant to another medium; minimal exposure of the on-site workers to the contaminant; \n\nlongtime protection of public health; and possible reduction in the duration of the remedial \n\nprocess (Okoh and Trejo- Hernandez, 2006). These advantages of the bioremediation systems \n\nover the other technologies have been summarized (Leavin and Gealt, 1993) as follows: can \n\nbe done on site i.e. in situ application; keeps site destruction to a minimum; eliminates \n\ntransportation costs and liabilities; eliminates long-term liability; biological systems are \n\ninvolved, hence often less expensive; and can be coupled with other treatment techniques to \n\nform a treatment train. There are three classifications of bioremediation according to \n\nHornung, (1997): Biotransformation - the alteration of contaminant molecules into less or \n\nnonhazardous molecules Biodegradation - the breakdown of organic substances in smaller \n\norganic or inorganic molecules Mineralization - is the complete biodegradation of organic \n\nmaterials into inorganic constituents such as CO2 or H2O. There are three general approaches \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\nto cleaning up contaminated soils:(i) Soil can be excavated from the ground and be either \n\ntreated or disposed of (Ex-situ treatment), (ii) Soil can be left in the ground and treated in \n\nplace (in-situ treatment), or (iii) soil can be left in the ground and contained to prevent the \n\ncontamination from becoming more widespread and reaching plants, animals, or humans \n\n(containment and intrinsic remediation), (Jim et al., 2005). \n\n \n\n1.4.1. In-situ bioremediation technologies.  \nIn situ bioremediation (ISB) is the use of microorganisms to degrade contaminants in \n\nplace with the goal of obtaining harmless chemicals as end products (Jim et al., 2005). ISB \n\nhas the potential to provide advantages such as complete destruction of the contaminant(s), \n\nlower risk to site workers, and lower equipment/operating costs (US EPA, 1997). This \n\ntechnology is highly dependent upon external conditions, which is the key to determining \n\nwhether bioremediation can be performed in situ. The conditions of greatest importance are \n\nthe physicochemical and chemical conditions that exist in the contaminated soil. These \n\nconditions includes dissolved oxygen for aerobic processes, moisture content, pH, nutrient \n\navailability especially with regard to nitrogen and phosphorus, temperature, soil composition \n\nand concentration of contaminants (Jim et al., 2005). These techniques are generally the most \n\ndesirable options due to lower cost and fewer disturbances since they provide the treatment in \n\nplace by avoiding excavation and transport of contaminants. In situ treatment is limited by the \n\ndepth of the soil that can be effectively treated. In many soils effective oxygen diffusion for \n\ndesirable rates of bioremediation extend to a range of only a few centimeters to about 30 cm \n\ninto the soil, although depths of 60 cm and greater have been effectively treated in some cases \n\n(Vidali, 2001). Accelerated in situ bioremediation is where substrate or nutrients are added to \n\nan aquifer to stimulate the growth of a target consortium of bacteria. Usually the target \n\nbacteria are indigenous; however enriched cultures of bacteria (from other sites) that are \n\nhighly efficient at degrading a particular contaminant can be introduced into the aquifer \n\n(bioaugmentation). Accelerated ISB is used where it is desired to increase the rate of \n\ncontaminant biotransformation, which may be limited by lack of required nutrients, electron \n\ndonor or electron acceptor. The type of amendment required depends on the target \n\nmetabolism for the contaminant of interest. Aerobic ISB may only require the addition of \n\noxygen, while anaerobic ISB often requires the addition of both an electron donor (e.g., \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\nlactate, benzoate) as well as an electron acceptor (e.g., nitrate, sulfate). Chlorinated solvents, \n\nin particular, often require the addition of a carbon substrate to stimulate reductive \n\ndechlorination. The goal of accelerated ISB is to increase the biomass throughout the \n\ncontaminated volume of aquifer, thereby achieving effective biodegradation of dissolved and \n\nsorbed contaminant (Wiedemeier et al., 1998). Accelerated in situ bioremediation can be \n\ncarried out in two ways: biostimulation and bioaugmentation. \n\n \n\n1.5. Factors affecting biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons.  \n\nThe fate of a contaminant in the environment is determined by characteristics of the \n\npollutants, the microorganisms, and the environment (Pfaender, Shimp, Palumbo, and \n\nBartholomew, 1985; Madsen, 1991; Tiedje, 1993). The concentration, distribution, function, \n\nand structure of the contaminants; the physiology and genetics of the indigenous or introduced \n\nmicroorganisms; and the various soil factors,  all result in complex interactions in the \n\nsubsurface. If one of these critical components is suboptimal for conversion of organic \n\ncontaminants, biodegradation will be slow or may not take place (Turco and Sadowsky, \n\n1995). Microbial degradation of hydrocarbons in the environment largely depends on the \n\nnumber of biotic and abiotic factors. Some of these factors which will be discussed in detail in \n\nthis section include: (1) Chemical and physical factor, (2) Biological factor and (3) Soil and \n\nEnvironmental Factor. \n\n1.5.1. Chemical and physical factor.  \nOrganic compounds differ widely in their solubility, from infinitely miscible polar \n\ncompounds, such as methanol, to extremely low solubility nonpolar compounds, such as \n\npolynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Horvath, 1982). Many synthetic chemicals have \n\nlow water solubilities (Stucki and Alexander, 1987). The availability of a compound to an \n\norganism will dictate its biodegradability (U.S. EPA, 1985a). Compounds with greater \n\naqueous solubilities are generally more available to degradative enzymes. An example is cis \n\n-1,2- dichloroethylene, which is preferentially degraded relative to trans -1,2-\n\ndichloroethylene. This is probably due to \u201ccis \u201d being more polar than \u201c trans \u201d and, \n\ntherefore, more water soluble. \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\nThe composition and inherent biodegradability of the petroleum hydrocarbon pollutant \n\nis the first and most important consideration when the suitability of a cleanup approach is to \n\nbe evaluated (Okoh, 2006). Compositional heterogeneity among different crude oils and \n\nrefined products influences the overall rate of biodegradation both of the oil and of its \n\ncomponent fractions (Leahly and Colwell, 1990). Biodegradability is inherently influenced by \n\nthe composition of the oil pollutant. For example, kerosene, which consists almost exclusively \n\nof medium chain alkanes, is under suitable conditions, totally biodegradable. Similarly, crude \n\noil is biodegradable quantitatively, but for heavy asphaltic-naphthenic crude oils, only about \n\n11% may be biodegradable within a reasonable time period, even if the conditions are \n\nfavourable (Bartha, 1986b). Okoh et al., (2002) reported that between 8.8 and 29% of the \n\nheavy crude oil Maya was biodegraded in soil microcosm by mixed bacterial consortium in \n\n15 days, although major peak components of the oil was reduced by between 6.5 and 70% \n\n(Okoh, 2003). Also, about 89% of the same crude oil was biodegraded by axenic culture of \n\nBurkholderia cepacia RQ1 in shake flask (Okoh et al., 2001) within similar time frame. \n\nOkoh, (2003) noted that heavier crude oils are generally much more difficult to biodegrade \n\nthan lighter ones, just as heavier crude oils could be suitable for inducing increased selection \n\npressure for the isolation of petroleum hydrocarbon degraders with enhanced efficiency. Also, \n\nOkoh et al., (2002) noted that the amount of heavy crude oil metabolized by some bacterial \n\nspecies increased with increasing concentration of starter oil up to 0.6% (w/v), while \n\ndegradation rates appeared to be more pronounced between the concentrations of 0.4 and \n\n0.6% (w/v) oil. \n\nThe physical and chemical nature of the oil pollution is a critical factor in determining \n\nrates of biodegradation. Access to the pollutant is a major consideration when trying to \n\ndegrade hydrocarbons which are, to a greater extent, hydrophobic. The dispersion of crude oil \n\nas an oil-in-water emulsion will increase the surface area available for microbial attack and \n\nthus increasing the rate of biodegradation. However, water-in-oil, or \"mousse\", emulsions can \n\nform, creating a low surface area to volume ratio, inhibiting biodegradation (Wilkinson et al., \n\n2002). The degree of spreading of oil in water or soil environment determines in part the \n\nsurface area of oil available for microbial colonization by hydrocarbon-degrading \n\nmicroorganisms; in aquatic systems, the oil normally spreads, forming a thin slick (Atlas, \n\n1981). The degree of spreading is reduced at low temperatures because of the viscosity of the \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\noil. In soils, petroleum hydrocarbons are absorbed by plant matter and soil particles, limiting \n\nits spreading. Similarly 'tar balls', which are large aggregates of weathered un-degraded oil, \n\nrestrict access by microorganisms because of their limited surface area. Auto-oxidation, \n\nphotooxidation and the removal of low molecular weight hydrocarbons by microbes all aid \n\ntheir formation and tar balls may take thousands of years to degrade (Wilkinson et al., 2002). \n\nHydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms act mainly at the oil-water interface. Such \n\nmicroorganisms can be observed growing over the entire surface of an oil droplet; growth \n\ndoes not appear to occur within oil droplets in the absence of entrained water. Availability of \n\nincreased surface area will under normal circumstance accelerate biodegradation (Atlas, 1981; \n\nIjah and Antai, 2003b).   \n\nConcentration of Petroleum hydrocarbon determines to a greater extent the rate of \n\nbreakdown of the hydrocarbons from the environment. Concentration of hydrocarbon can \n\naffect its biodegradability and toxicity to the degrading organisms. High concentration of \n\nhydrocarbon can be inhibitory to microorganisms, and concentration with which inhibition \n\noccurs will vary with the compound. Concentrations of 1 to 100?g/ml of water or 1 to \n\n100?g/g of soil or sediment (on dry weight basis) are not generally considered to be toxic to \n\ncommon heterotrophic bacteria and fungi. Ijah and Antai, (2003b) reported high degradation \n\nof hydrocarbons in soil contaminated with 10% and 20% crude oil compared to those \n\ncontaminated with 30 and 40% crude oil which experienced partial degradation of \n\nhydrocarbons within a period of 12 months. Another authors reported that percentage of \n\ndegradation by mixed bacterial consortium decreased from 78% to 52% as the concentration \n\nof crude oil was increased from 1 to 10% (Rahman et al., 2002). High concentrations of \n\nhydrocarbons can be associated with heavy, undispersed oil slicks in water, causing inhibition \n\nof biodegradation by nutrient or oxygen limitation or through toxic effects exerted by volatile \n\nhydrocarbons. Fusey and Oudot (1984) reported that contamination of seashore sediments \n\nwith crude oil above a threshold concentration prevented biodegradation of the oil because of \n\noxygen and/or nutrient limitation. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\n1.5.2. Biological factor.  \nIncreased persistence of chemicals may result from several types of biological \n\ninteractions: (1) the biocidal properties of the chemicals to soil microorganisms may preclude \n\ntheir biodegradation, (2) direct inhibition of the adaptive enzymes of effective soil \n\nmicroorganisms, and (3) inhibition of the proliferation processes of effective microorganisms \n\n(Kaufman, 1983). Inhibition of microbial degradation may ultimately affect the mobility of a \n\nchemical in soil. Bioavailability is extremely important to biodegradation of organic \n\npollutants. It is frequently observed that the rate of removal of compounds from soil is very \n\nlow even though the compounds are biodegradable, the substrates in these instance may not \n\nbe in a form that is readily available to the microorganisms (Jim et al., 2005). Biodegradation \n\nof hydrophobic pollutants may take place only in the aqueous phase, e.g., naphthalene is \n\nutilized by pure cultures of bacteria only in the dissolved state (Wodzinski and Bertolini, \n\n1972). Bouchez et al., (1995) similarly showed that phenanthrene biodegradation occurs only \n\nin the aqueous phase. The three main classes of hydrocarbons (aliphatic, alicyclic and \n\naromatic hydrocarbons) vary in their biodegradability according to size and solubility. It is \n\nbelieved that only molecules of hydrocarbons that are dissolved in the aqueous phase are \n\navailable for intracellular metabolism (Sikkema et al., 1995). The rate at which a particular \n\norganic compound dissolves in water is critical to its biodegradability because this governs \n\nthe rate of transfer to the organism (Jim et al. 2005). The rate of transfer is determined by the \n\nequilibrium and actual concentration in the bulk phase and aqueous phase. This central to the \n\nconcept of bioavailability as it relates to biodegradation. \n\n \n\n1.5.3. Soil and environmental factor.  \nMany microorganisms have specific ecological niches for proliferation and \n\ncolonization (Daubaras and Chakrabarty, 1992). Metabolism by the indigenous microflora is \n\ninfluenced by soil and environmental factors, such as light, temperature (climate, daily and \n\nseasonal temperature fluctuations), pH, presence of cometabolites, reactive radicals, other \n\norganic and inorganic compounds, available oxygen and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), \n\nas well as the physical state of the oil (Cooney, Silver, and Beck, 1985), moisture content, \n\norganic matter, oxidation-reduction potential, attenuation, and soil texture and structure. The \n\nenvironment influences biodegradation by regulating both the bioavailability of the compound \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\nand the activity of the degraders. Often the most important factor limiting rates of \n\nbiodegradation in the environment is the availability of molecular oxygen (Jim et al., 2005). \n\nThe initial step in the catabolism of hydrocarbons by bacteria and fungi involves the oxidation \n\nof the substrate by oxygenase to which molecular oxygen is required. Aerobic condition is \n\ntherefore necessary for this route of microbial oxidation of hydrocarbons in the soil \n\nenvironment. The availability of oxygen in the soil is dependent on rates of microbial oxygen \n\nconsumption, the type of soil, and the presence of utilizable substrate, which can lead to \n\noxygen depletion (Bartha and Bossert, 1984). Delivering air or oxygen to contaminated soils \n\nmay be difficult for a number of reasons: the soil porosity may not be favourable and \n\ntherefore mass transfer from the gas phase to the aqueous phase will be limited. Also \n\nrelatively low solubility of oxygen in water is a primary limiting factor (Jim, et al. 2005). \n\nMost contaminated soil may contain large populations of the appropriate microorganisms but \n\ncan remain contaminated for decades or longer as a result of conditions that do not favour \n\nrapid biodegradation of complex pollutants.  The complete oxidation of aromatic compounds \n\nand hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide is difficult in the absence of molecular oxygen due to the \n\ngreat stability of C \u2013 H and C \u2013 C bonds. \n\n Temperature plays very important roles in biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons, \n\nfirstly by its direct effect on the chemistry of the pollutants, and secondly on its effect on the \n\nphysiology and diversity of the microorganisms (Okoh, 2006). Soil temperature is one of the \n\nmore important factors controlling microbiological activity and the rate of organic matter \n\ndecomposition (Sims and Bass, 1984). Temperatures of both air and soil affect the rate of \n\nbiological degradation processes in the soil, as well as the soil moisture content (JRB \n\nAssociates, Inc., 1984). Temperature affects the physical nature and composition of the \n\npetroleum, the rate of microbial hydrocarbon metabolism, and the composition of the \n\nmicrobial communities (Atlas, 1994). Ambient temperature of an environment affects both the \n\nproperties of spilled oil and the activity or population of microorganisms (Venosa and Zhu, \n\n2003). Temperature plays a significant role in controlling the nature and extent of microbial \n\nhydrocarbon metabolism (Nedwell, 1999; Frederic et al., 2005). Temperature affects the rate \n\nof biodegradation, as well as the physical nature and chemical composition of hydrocarbons \n\n(Whyte et al., 1998; Rowland et al., 2000). Although microbial activity is generally reduced at \n\nlow temperatures, many of the components in crude oil and diesel can actually be degraded by \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\npsychrophilic and psychrotrophic microorganisms (Margesin and Schinner, 1999a). The \n\nbioavailability of soluble hydrophobic substances, such as aliphatic and polyaromatic \n\nhydrocarbons, is temperature dependent. A temperature increase leads to an increase in \n\ndiffusion rates of organic compounds notably by a decrease of their viscosity (Northcott and \n\nJones, 2000). Thus, higher molecular reaction rates due to smaller boundary layers are \n\nexpected at elevated temperatures. In counterpart, the increased volatilization and solubility of \n\nsome hydrocarbons at elevated temperature may enhance their toxicity (Whyte et al., 1998). \n\nSuch an increase in toxicity may delay the onset of degradation (Leahly and Colwell, 1990). \n\nTemperature influences the rate of abiotic weathering process notably evaporation. \n\nTemperature can also affect hydrocarbon utilization; bacteria relatively metabolize \n\nisoprenoids at 30oC but have difficulty doing so at 40oC. Although many species can \n\nwithstand freezing and thawing, bacteria cease growth and metabolism altogether at \n\ntemperature below 12oC due to the formation of intracellular ice (Margesin and Schinner, \n\n1999b). It is essential that contaminated sites be at the optimum temperature for \n\nbioremediation to progress successfully, since excessively high or low temperatures \n\nsometimes inhibit microbial metabolism. Although hydrocarbon biodegradation can occur \n\nover a wide range of temperatures, the rate of biodegradation generally decreases with \n\ndecreasing temperature. Highest degradation rates generally occur in the range of 30 \u2013 40 oC \n\nin soil environments, 20 \u2013 30oC in some freshwater environments, and 15 \u2013 20 oC in marine \n\nenvironments (Bartha and Bossert, 1984). In addition, the solubility and bioavailability of a \n\ncontaminant will increase as temperature increases, and oxygen solubility will be reduced, \n\nwhich will leave less oxygen available for microbial metabolism (Margesin and Schinner, \n\n1999a).  \n\nNutrients are very important ingredients for successful biodegradation of hydrocarbon \n\npollutants, especially N, P and in some cases Fe (Okoh, 2006). Inadequate mineral nutrient, \n\nespecially N, and P, often limits the growth of hydrocarbon utilizers in water and soils. \n\nAddition of N and P to an oil polluted soil has been shown to accelerate the biodegradation of \n\nthe petroleum in soil (Ijah and Safiyanu, 1997). Addition of a carbon source as a nutrient in \n\ncontaminated soil is known to enhance the rate of pollutant degradation by stimulating the \n\ngrowth of microorganisms responsible for biodegradation of the pollutant. Depending on the \n\nnature of the impacted environment, some of these nutrients could become limiting, hence the \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\nadditions of nutrients are necessary to enhance the biodegradation of oil pollutants (Kim et al., \n\n2005). It has been suggested that the addition of carbon in the form of pyruvate stimulates the \n\nmicrobial growth and enhances the rate of PAH degradation. Depending on the nature of the \n\nimpacted environment, some of these nutrients could become limiting, hence the additions of \n\nnutrients are necessary to enhance the biodegradation of oil pollutants (Kim et al., 2005). \n\nPelletier et al., (2004) assessed the effectiveness of fertilizers for crude oil bioremediation in \n\nsub-Antarctic intertidal sediments over a one year and observed that chemical, microbial and \n\ntoxicological parameters demonstrated the effectiveness of various fertilizers in a pristine \n\nenvironment. Frederic et al., (2005), observed that addition of commercial oleophilic \n\nfertilizers containing N and P to hydrocarbon contaminated soil increased the hydrocarbon. \n\nSoil pH can be highly variable, ranging from 2.5 in mine spoils to 11.0 in alkaline \n\ndeserts (Bossert and Bartha, 1984). Most heterotrophic bacteria and fungi favor a pH near \n\nneutrality, with fungi being more tolerant to acidic conditions (Atlas, 1988). Extremes in pH, \n\nas can be observed in some soils, would have a negative influence on the ability of microbial \n\npopulations to degrade hydrocarbons. Verstraete et al., (1976) reported a near doubling of \n\nrates of biodegradation of gasoline in an acidic (pH 4.5) soil by adjusting the pH to 7.4. Rates \n\ndropped significantly, however, when the pH was further raised to 8.5. Similarly, Dibble and \n\nBartha (1979) observed an optimal pH of 7.8, in the range 5.0 to 7.8, for the mineralization of \n\noily sludge in soil. The pH of sediments in special environments such as salt marshes may be \n\nas low as 5.0 in some cases. Hambrick et al., (1980) found that the rates of microbial \n\nmineralization of octadecane and napthalene to be depressed at this pH compared with pH \n\n6.5. Octadecane mineralization rates increased further when the pH was raised from 6.5 to \n\n8.0, whereas naphthalene mineralization rates did not. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\nChapter 1 \n\nBIOREMEDIATION OF BRAZILIAN SOILS CONTAMINATED WITH USED \nLUBRICATING OIL \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n \n\nEnvironmental pollution with petroleum and petrochemical products has attracted \nmuch attention in recent decades. The use of various kinds of automobiles and machinery \nvehicles has caused an increase in the use of motor oil and in addition, oil spillages into the \nenvironment have become one of the major problems. Spillages of used lubricating oils \ncontaminate natural environment with hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbons spread both vertically \nand horizontally on both surface and ground-water bodies, soil pore space and adhere/adsorb \ninto surfaces of soil particles. The contamination of groundwater resources by organic \nchemicals is significant environmental problem that can constitute risks to health of humans \nand animals. It is believed that remediation methods are favoured and have been used \nparticularly as a secondary treatment option for clean-up of oil spillage. This work has the \nintent for evaluation and remediation of organic pollutants in particular, spent motor oil \ncontaminated soils via bioremediation.  The rates of biodegradation of the used motor oil were \nstudied for a period of 90 days. The model soil of 300 g was contaminated with 1.5 % (w/w) \nof used motor oil at room temperature under laboratory conditions using microcosm of 1 L. \nThe microcosm was used to simulate the comparative effect of spent oil addition and \nbioremediation using a commercially available hydrocarbon degrading microbial consortium - \nAmnite p1300 as the bioaugmentation  (T1),  nutrients amendments - (NH4)2SO4 and K2HPO4 \n(NPK) as biostimulation treatment (T2), unammended soil - natural attenuation as (T3) and \nthe control soil treated with sodium azide (NaN3) as (T4) on the microbial community in three \ndifferent soil  types (S1, S2 and S3). Hydrocarbon-utilizing bacterial counts were high in the \namended soils with treatments T1, T2, and T3 ranging from 3.47 \u00d7 106 to 3.27 \u00d7 108 CFU/g \ncompared to T4 throughout the 90 days of study. Oil-contaminated soil in T1 showed the \nhighest reduction in total petroleum hydrocarbon with net loss of 36.17 % throughout the 90 \ndays of the experiment compared to other treatments and three soils. The development of the \nmicrobial community and its recovery is a useful and sensitive way of monitoring the impact \nand recovery of used motor oil-contaminated soils. Commercially available microbial-based \nbioremediation products may be used with some success in tropical soil environments, \nhowever soil-specific trials may be required to ensure that the best commercial product is \nselected. As an alternative, the selective enrichment of indigenous microorganisms may result \nin similar performance at a reduced cost. The results suggest that different soils have different \ninherent microbial potential to degrade hydrocarbons under spent oil pollution. This finding \nshould be taken into account in impact and risk assessments of petroleum polluted soils. \n\n \nKey words: Bioremediation, used lubricating oil, hydrocarbons, microbial consortium, \n\nsoil types. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\nCap\u00edtulo 1 \n\nBIORREMEDIA\u00c7\u00c3O DE SOLOS BRASILEIRO CONTAMINADOS COM \u00d3LEO \nLUBRIFICANTE USADO \n\nRESUMO \n\nA polui\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental com petr\u00f3leo e produtos petroqu\u00edmicos tem atra\u00eddo muito aten\u00e7\u00e3o \nem d\u00e9cadas recentes.

Introduction \n\nDespite efforts in some countries to recover and recycle used motor oils, significant \n\namounts of lubricants are input into the environment, particularly in environmentally sensitive \n\napplications such as forestry and mining, or through engine losses (Battersby, 2000). \n\nConsequently, considerable attention has been given to lubricant biodegradability and \n\npersistence in the environment. Therefore, there is a need for effective and environmentally \n\nsafe cleanup treatments of oil spills. The United State Environmental Protection Agency (40 \n\nCFR Part 279) defined \u201cused oil\u2019\u2019 as \u201cany oil that has been refined from crude oil or any \n\nsynthetic oil that has been used and, as a result of such use is contaminated by physical or \n\nchemical impurities.\u2019\u2019 Used motor oil contains metals and heavy polycyclic aromatic \n\nhydrocarbons derived from engine oil - a complex mixture of hydrocarbons and other organic \n\ncompounds, including some organometallic constituents (Butler and Mason, 1997) that is \n\nused to lubricate parts of an automobile engine, in order to smooth engine operation (Hagwell \n\net al., 1992; Boonchan et al., 2000). The rise in consumption of automotive lubricating oil is a \n\nworldwide problem and has increased in large used oil volume and its waste. In Brazil, the \n\nproblems tend to worsen with economic growth, population growth, and rapid \n\nindustrialization and disregard for environmental health, particularly in relation to used motor \n\noil. The consumption of lubricating oil in Brazil is around 106 m3/year (Conselho em Revista, \n\n2005; Magalh\u00e3es et al.,2007). Approximately 6.5 x 105 m3/year are consumed in the \n\nlubrication process, and from 3.5 x 105 m3/year remainder, only 20% are treated or recycled; \n\ntherefore, significant volumes of used motor oil are continually discharged into the \n\necosystems (local environment). Release of hydrocarbons into the environment whether \n\naccidentally or due to human activities is a main cause of water and soil pollution (Holliger et \n\nal., 1997). These hydrocarbon pollutants usually cause disruptions of natural equilibrium \n\nbetween the living species and their natural environment. The persistent hydrocarbon \n\ncomponents are known to have carcinogenic and neurotoxic activities (Reddy and Matthew, \n\n2001; Das and Chandran, 2010). One gallon of used motor oil, improperly disposed of, may \n\ncontaminate 1 million gallons of fresh water, which is enough to supply 50 people with \n\ndrinking water for one year. One pint (4 gills or 568.26 cubic centimeters) of used motor oil \n\nimproperly disposed of can create a one-acre slick on the surface of a body of water and kill \n\nfloating aquatic organisms (USEPA, 1996).  \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\nThe uses and unsafe disposal of petroleum hydrocarbon products increase soil \n\ncontamination, and this has constituted major environmental problems. Therefore, the \n\ndevelopment of research to remediate soils contaminated with used motor oils, in particular \n\nbioremediation, provides an effective and efficient strategy to speed up the clean-up processes \n\n(Mandri and Lin, 2007). Various factors including lack of essential nutrients such as nitrogen \n\nand phosphorus may limit the rate of petroleum hydrocarbon degradation from contaminated \n\nsoil. Addition of inorganic nutrients (biostimulation) is therefore needed as an effective \n\napproach to enhance the bioremediation process (Semple et al., 2006; Walworth et al., 2007). \n\nAlso, many microbial strains, each capable of degrading a specific compound, are available \n\ncommercially for bioremediation (Bragg et al., 1994; Korda et al., 1997; Song et al., 1990). \n\nThis study aimed at evaluating of the remediation potentials of organic pollutants, in \n\nparticular, spent motor oil contaminated soils, via bioremediation using commercial microbial \n\nconsortium. It was also aimed to test a kinetic model to determine the rate of biodegradation \n\nof the hydrocarbon in the soil and subsequently determine the half-life of the oil degradation. \n\n \n\n2. MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n2.1. Collection of samples. The soil sample used was collected from three different \n\nlocations in Minas Gerais State, Brazil, in a hermetic bag and transported to the laboratory for \n\nanalysis. Used engine oil was collected from a gasoline and car service station close to the \n\nFederal University of Vi\u00e7osa. Amnite P1300 special bacterial strains (Amnite P1300) \n\nspecially made to degrade used motor oil was obtained from Cleveland Biotech Ltd., UK \n\n \n\n2.2. Experimental Design: microcosm set-up description. The model soil of 300 g \n\nwas contaminated with 1.5 % (w/w) or (15000 mg/kg) of used motor oil at room temperature \n\nof (25 \u00b1 1 0C) under laboratory conditions using microcosm of 1 L. The microcosms were \n\nused to simulate the comparative effect of spent oil addition and bioremediation using a \n\ncommercially available hydrocarbon degrading microbial consortium (Amnite P1300), \n\nconsisting a mixture of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Pseudomonas putida, \n\nPseudomonas fluorescens, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Rhodococcus rhodocrous on a \n\ncereal (bran) as the bioaugmentation treatment. The microorganisms were conditioned to \n\ndegrade heavy hydrocarbons. The population numbers in Amnite P1300 was approximately 5 \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\n \n\nx 108 cfu/g of bran. Also, the polluted soils were amended with (NH4)2SO4 and K2HPO4) as \n\nbiostimulation. The C:N:P ratio of the nutrient compound was adjusted to 100:7.5:1 (optimum \n\nconditions). The same conditions provided in the biostimulation treatment were used in the \n\nbioaugmentation treatments plus the addition of Amnite P1300. The unammended soil \n\n(natural attenuation), without addition of nutrients and microbial inoculum was included to \n\nindicate hydrocarbon degradation capability of microorganisms naturally present in the \n\ncontaminated soils (i.e. the autochthonous microbes). There was a control soil in which most \n\nof the indigenous bacteria were killed by the added biocide sodium azide (NaN3) (0.3% ww \n\n_1) to inhibit soil microorganisms and to monitor abiotic hydrocarbon losses on the microbial \n\ncommunity in three different soil types. There were six sampling dates; hence 36 microcosms \n\nin total were used. Microcosms were arranged in a random order, and rearranged every 2 \n\nweeks \u00b1 2 days throughout the duration of the experiment The treatments were set up in \n\ntriplicate, while the content of each container was tilled every week for aeration, and the \n\nmoisture content was maintained at 70% (Pramer and Bartha, 1972), water holding capacity \n\nby the addition of sterile distilled water every week until the end of the experiment. \n\n \n \n\n2.3. Sampling. Periodic sampling from each microcosm was carried out at 15-day \n\nintervals for 90 days. Composite samples were obtained by mixing 10 g of soil collected from \n\ndifferent areas of the microcosm for bacteria enumeration and determination of total \n\npetroleum hydrocarbon. \n\n \n\n2.4. Determination of the physicochemical property of the soil. Table 2 shows the \n\norigin and selected physical and chemical characteristics of the noncontaminated soil samples \n\nused for the bioremediation studies. Nitrogen content of the soil was determined using the \n\nKjeldahl method, the available phosphorus was determined by colometry after Mehlich 1 \n\nextraction and Organic Carbon content was determined using a modifield Walkley-Black \n\n(1934) method. The pH was determined using 1:2.5 ratio by weight with distilled water (w/v) \n\nafter 30-min equilibration using a pH meter and electrode calibrated with pH 4.0 and 7.0 \n\nstandards. Determinations were made in triplicate.  \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\n \nTable 2: Selected physical and chemical characteristics of the non-contaminated soil samples \nParameters   Soil 1 (S1)  Soil 2 (S2)  Soil 3 (S3) \n\npH (H20)  5.20   5.91   4.92 \n\nTotal Nitrogen (%) 0.43   0.24   0.11 \n\nAvail.

Microbial monitoring and enumeration of total aerobic heterotrophic and \n\nhydrocarbon-degrading bacteria. The study was conducted at room temperature and \n\nmonitoring was performed on days 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90. To monitor cell numbers and \n\nbiodegradation, 1 g of soil was removed from each microcosm at the set times and suspended \n\nin 9 mL of saline solution  in sterile centrifuge tubes. The mixture was vigorously shaken on a \n\nvortex mixer for 3 minutes and then the soil particulates were allowed to settle for 1 min \n\nbefore 0.1 mL of the supernatant was sampled for CFU counts. The number of colony-\n\nforming total aerobic heterotrophic bacteria (AHB) was determined by plating three replicate \n\nsamples from each treatment withdrawn every 15 days. Serially diluted samples (0.1 mL) \n\nwere plated on nutrient agar medium (Oxoid) supplemented with 10 mg/mL solution of \n\ncycloheximide in which 1 mL/L was drawn to suppress the growth of fungi. The oil agar \n\nplates were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 24 hours, and the colonies were counted. Also, enumeration \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\n \n\nof hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (HDB) was attempted on a mineral medium containing \n\nmotor oil as the sole carbon source. The mineral medium contained 1.8 g K2HPO4, 4.0 g \n\nNH4Cl, 0.2 g MgSO4.7H2O, 1.2 g KH2PO4, 0.01 g FeSO4.7H2O, 0.1 g NaCl, 20 g agar, one \n\npercent (1%) used engine oil in 1,000 mL distilled water, and the medium was adjusted to  pH \n\n7.4 (Zajic and Supplission, 1972). The oil agar plates were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 7 days \n\nbefore the colonies were counted. \n\n \n2.6. Extraction of residual oil and analysis of total petroleum hydrocarbons. Total \n\nPetroleum Hydrocarbons (TPHs) were extracted according to EPA method 3546 (US EPA, \n\n2007) using the Microwave Automated Reaction System from CEM (Matthews, NC). Briefly, \n\nSodium sulfate (Na2SO4) was purified by drying overnight in an oven at 150\u00b0C and quickly \n\ntransferred into a desiccator, Five grams (5 g) of homogenised contaminated soil was weighed \n\nout, mixed with 5 g dry anhydrous Na2SO4 and ground to less than 1 mm particle sizes, \n\nextracted in GreenChem vessels with 25 mL of a 1:1 hexane:acetone mixture according to \n\nmanufacturer\u2019s protocol at 100 \u00b0C for 20 minutes.  The n-hexane and acetone was filtered \n\nthrough whatman No 1 filter paper to separate the extract from the soil particles, and \n\ntransferred into 100 mL amber vials through separatory funnel and sequentially rinsed with \n\nequal volume of solvent mixture. The solvent were evaporated topartial dryness with a rotary \n\nevaporator (Fizatom Rotavapor 801), transferred into 2 mL vials and then dried completely \n\nusing nitrogen gas. Dried samples were dissolved in 600 \u00b5L dichloromethane for gas \n\nchromatography analysis. The residual oil was analyzed on Shimadzu GC-17A \n\nChromatograph equipped with a Flame-Ionization Detector (FID) by using fused silica \n\ncapillary column DB-5 (30 x 0.25 mm), and AOC-17 Shimadzu auto injector complying with \n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) standard method 8015 (US EPA 2007). The flow \n\nrate of the helium carrier gas was 1.81 mL/min with linear velocity of 38.49 cm/s. The initial \n\ntemperature was programmed at 40oC and held for 15 min. The temperature was then \n\nincreased to 280oC at a rate of 10oC /min. The final temperature was held for 31 min. The \n\ninjector was set in the split mode, the split ratio was set to 1:10; the injection volume was 1 \n\n\u00b5L and the injector and the detector temperature for GC were maintained at 260 and 280\u00b0C, \n\nrespectively, and the oven temperature was programmed to rise from 40 to 280\u00b0C in \n\n10\u00b0C/min increments and to hold at 280\u00b0C for 31 min. The dry weight of the soil samples was \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\n \n\ndetermined following baking of 10 g of wet soil at > 80 \u00b0C for at least 48 hours. Before \n\nanalyzing the sample extract, a mixture of standards including n-alkanes (n-decane n-C10, n-\n\ndodecane n-C12, n-tetradecane n-C14, n-hexadecane n-C16, n-octadecane n-C18, n-eicosane n-\n\nC20, n-docosane n-C22, n-tetracosane n-C24, n-hexacosane n-C26, n-octacosane n-C28 and a \n\npure standards containing n-triacontane n-C30, n-dotriacontane n-C32, n-tetratriacontane n-\n\nC34, and n-hexatriacontane n-C36, and a mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon \n\nconsisting of acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, anthracene, benzo (a) anthracene, benzo (a) \n\npyrene, benzo (b) fluoranthene, benzo (g, h, i) perylene, benzo (k) fluoranthene, chrysene, \n\ndibenz (a, h) anthracene, fluoranthene,fluorine, indeno (1, 2, 3-cd) pyrene, naphthalene, \n\nphenanthrene, pyrene, 1-methylnaphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene, Supelco) were used for \n\ncalibration. Five points calibration curves using peak areas were obtained and the response \n\nfactors were used to determine the concentrations of various hydrocarbons in the sample \n\nextract. The total petroleum hydrocarbons were identified and quantified by comparing the \n\npeak area of samples with that of the standard of the TPH mixture with reference to the curve \n\nderived from standards. Percentage of degradation was calculated by the following \n\nexpression:  \n\n% ???????????????????????????? = ?\n?????? ?????????????? \u2013  ?????? ??????????????????\n\n?????? ??????????????\n? \u00d7 100                            (1)  \n\n \n\nTPH data were fitted to the first-order kinetics model (Yeung et al., 1997): \n\n?? = ?? ???????                                                                                                                                (2) \n\nwhere y is the residual hydrocarbon content in soil (mg/kg), a is the initial hydrocarbon \n\ncontent in soil (mg/kg), k is the biodegradation rate constant (day-1) and t is time (days). The \n\nbiodegradation rate constant (k), and half-life ln(2)/k of the hydrocarbons in soil during the \n\nbioremediation process were calculated from the model using Statistical \u00ae software (Stat \n\nSoft. Inc. (2007). The model was used to estimate the rate of biodegradation and half-life of \n\nhydrocarbons in soil under each treatment and the model was based on the assumption that the \n\ndegradation rate of hydrocarbons positively correlated with the hydrocarbon pool size in the \n\nsoil. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\n \n\n2.7. Statistical Analysis. Statistical analysis of data was carried out using analysis of \n\nvariance. Means of different treatments were also compared statistically using a General \n\nLinear Model (ANOVA) (Tukey test, p >0.05) using statistical 8.0 software (Stat Soft, 2007). \n\n \n \n\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS \n \n3.1. Microbial Counts. The aerobic heterotrophic bacterial (AHB) counts in T1 ranged \n\nbetween 1.01 x 108 and 2.4 x 109 CFU/g while T2 and T3 ranged from 1.03 x 108 to 1.7 x 109 \n\nand 1.0 x 108 to 3.8 x 108 CFU/g respectively (Fig. 3) in all the three soil types. The treatment \n\nT4 had AHB count ranging between 1.27 x 103 and 6.03 x 105 CFU/g. Hydrocarbon \n\nDegrading Bacterial (HDB) counts were also higher in oil contaminated soil in T1, T2 and T3 \n\n(Fig. 4). The count of HDB in soil amended with T1 was about 2% higher than those amended \n\nwith T2 and T3. HDB count in soil amended with T1 ranged from 3.6 x 106 to 3.3 x 108 \n\nCFU/g, while those amended with T2 and T3 ranged from 3.7 x 106 to 2.6 x 108 and 3.5 x 106 \n\nto 5.41 x 107CFU/g, respectively. However, the HDB counts in T4 were 1.07 x 103 to 7.07 x \n\n104 CFU/g lower than T1, T2 and T3. The counts of HDB in soils T1, T2 and T3 were higher \n\ncompared to that of T4. These results were similar to that obtained by Antai and Mgbomo \n\n(1989) whose counts of HDB in hydrocarbon-contaminated soil was 108 CFU/g, but higher \n\nthan that of Ghazali et al. (2004), who obtained 107CFU/g; from hydrocarbons degradation in \n\ndiesel oil polluted soil. The discrepancies in the results may be due to the characteristics and \n\nthe ecology of the different soil types used for the experiments. The microbial counts of the \n\nsoils S1 and S2 showed the same pattern. Counts in soils amended with T1 gave highest \n\nfollowed by T2 and T3. Whereas, microbial counts in soil S3 showed different pattern \n\ncompared with S1 and S2, as T2 gave highest counts compared with T1 and T3. Treatment T4 \n\nhas the least results in all the soils used for the experiment. This result clearly demonstrates \n\nthe benefit of bioaugmentation, biostimulation and indigenous microorganisms of used \n\nlubricating oil polluted soil. An enhanced comparison between the four treatments \n\ninvestigated in this work is revealed in figure 3 and 4. Treatment T4 is a control system where \n\nmost of the indigenous bacteria were killed with a biocide (NaN3). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\n \n\nHigh Clayey\n\nA\nH\n\nB\n C\n\nou\nnt\n\ns \n(L\n\nog\n C\n\nFU\n/g\n\n)\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nLow Clayey\n\nA\nH\n\nB\n C\n\nou\nnt\n\ns \n(L\n\nog\n C\n\nFU\n/g\n\n)\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nClay Loamy Sand\n\nTime (days)\n\n0 15 30 45 60 75 90\n\nA\nH\n\nB\n C\n\nou\nnt\n\ns \n(L\n\nog\n C\n\nFU\n/g\n\n)\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nSOIL+OIL+P1300 SOIL+OIL+NPK \n\nSOIL+OIL SOIL+OIL+NaN3 \nFig 3: Counts of aerobic heterotrophic bacterial (AHB) population in oil- \ncontaminated soils.

There was a noticeable reduction \n\nin the total petroleum hydrocarbon within the first 15 days in all the treatments, but higher \n\nreduction was observed at 30 days compared to the control (T4). At the end of the 30 days, \n\nthere was 49, 69 and 73 % TPH reduction in T3, T1 and T2 respectively, that is, 7,306; \n\n10,278 and 10,881 mg/ kg. TPH reduction was observed in these treatments compared to 27 \n\n% (3,991 mg/ kg) TPH reduction in the control soil S1. The same trend was noticed in soils \n\nS2 and S3 with T2 (NPK) having the highest TPH reduction (Fig. 5). Because, feeding \n\nnutrient solutions containing inorganic substances, such as nitrogen and phosphorus to natural \n\nsoil bacteria often enhances the ability of the microorganisms to degrade organic molecules \n\ninto carbon dioxide and water (Stotzky and Norman, 1961a; 1961b). During this period, the \n\nadded bacteria product acclimatized to their new source of carbon. At the end of 90 days \n\nexperiment, oil-contaminated soil amended with T1 (Soil + Oil + Amnite P1300) showed the \n\nhighest reduction in concentration of used engine oil (89%), followed closely by soil amended \n\nwith T2 (Soil + Oil + NPK) (78%), but no significant differences were observed between the \n\ntreatments T1 and T2. The results obtained in soil type S3 is lower compared to that of S1 and \n\nS2, this may be due to clay contents in these soils which have been shown to offer greater \n\ncapacity for physicochemical attenuation of contaminants than coarse sands (Pye and Patrick, \n\n1983). However, highest percentage (68%) of TPH reduction was observed in soil amended \n\nwith T2 in soil S3 at the end of 90 days experiments. The net percentage loss of used oil in the \n\ncontaminated soils could indicate the effectiveness of each treatment. The highest net \n\npercentage loss was observed at 30 days in T2 (45.93%), (40.33%) and (32.58%) followed by \n\nthat of T1 (41.91%), (36.36%) and (28.83%) and T3 (22.10%), (22.10%) and (10.32%) in \n\nsoils S1, S2 and S3, respectively (Table 3). However, the net percentage loss of used oil \n\nincreased from45 days in T1 to the end of the 90 day experiment compared with other \n\ntreatments. \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\n \n\nTable 3: Net percentage loss of total petroleum hydrocarbon in soils during bioremediation \n \n\n  \nSoil types Treatments        Time (days) \n \n ___________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n  15  30  45  60  75  90 \n                           \n \n  \nS1         T1 18.53\u00b11.3  41.91\u00b11.4  29.59\u00b10.7  33.50\u00b11.2  34.56\u00b11.0         36.17\u00b10.8 \n\n                   T2 20.54\u00b11.4  45.93\u00b11.3  29.37\u00b10.8  28.28\u00b10.7  26.88\u00b11.2          25.94\u00b10.8 \n                T3 7.08\u00b11.3  22.10\u00b11.4  18.10\u00b10.7  17.08\u00b10.4  15.77\u00b11.2         16.13\u00b10.8 \n\n \n\n      \n\n      S2      T1 15.29\u00b11.0  36.36\u00b10.4  34.21\u00b11.0  31.54\u00b11.7  32.31\u00b11.3          31.66\u00b12.3\n  \n\n                T2  17.21\u00b12.0    40.33\u00b11.2  33.68\u00b10.5  31.19\u00b11.0  31.37\u00b11.2          23.47\u00b12.1 \n  \n\n    T3 4.86\u00b11.7 20.77\u00b11.1 15.24\u00b11.9  12.90\u00b11.4  13.48\u00b11.2          10.58\u00b12.1 \n\n       \n \n\n          \n\n      \n                 \nS3      T1 10.54\u00b12.6  28.83\u00b12.3  21.21\u00b11.8  22.48\u00b12.6  23.59\u00b10.9          23.47\u00b12.1\n  \n \n\n          T2 10.84\u00b11.1  32.58\u00b11.4  22.88\u00b11.0  23.50\u00b10.8  24.53\u00b10.9          24.99\u00b12.3\n  \n\n \n    T3  4.86\u00b12.2  10.32\u00b10.4  6.77\u00b10.8  6.24\u00b11.4  5.70\u00b10.8           10.58\u00b12.1 \n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nT1=soil+oil+Amnite P1300, T2=soil+oil+(NH4)2SO4 and K2HPO4), T3=soil+oil alone; S1=Red Latosol, S2 = Red Latosol, S3=  Red-\nYellowish Latosol;  Net % loss = % loss in TPH of oil-contaminated amended soils and oil-contaminated soil alone  ? %  loss in TPH of \nunamended contaminated control soil with sodium azide. \n \n \n\n       \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\n \n\nHigh Clayey\n\nR\nes\n\nid\nua\n\nl T\nPH\n\n (m\ng/\n\nkg\n)\n\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\n6000\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\n12000\n\n14000\n\n16000\n\ny = 15082 * exp ( -0.0283* t )\nR\u00b2 = 0.91\n\ny = 11594* exp ( - 0.0188* t )\nR\u00b2 = 0.67 \n\n      y = 13887* exp ( -0.0146* t )\n      R\u00b2 = 0.83\n\ny = 14688* exp ( - 0.0091* t )\nR\u00b2 = 0.91\n\n \n\nLow Clayey\n\nR\nes\n\nid\nua\n\nl T\nPH\n\n (m\ng/\n\nkg\n)\n\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\n6000\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\n12000\n\n14000\n\n16000\n\ny = 15029* exp ( -0.0236* t )\nR\u00b2 = 0.85 \n\ny = 13504* exp ( -0.0207* t )\nR\u00b2 = 0.75\n\ny = 13784* exp ( -0.0115* t )\nR\u00b2 = 0.75 \n\ny = 14946* exp ( -0.0084* t )\nR\u00b2 = 0.90\n\nClayey Loamy Sand\n\nTime (days)\n15 30 45 60 75 90\n\nR\nes\n\nid\nua\n\nl T\nPH\n\n (m\ng/\n\nkg\n)\n\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\n6000\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\n12000\n\n14000\n\n16000\n\ny = 13603* exp ( -0.0129* t )\nR\u00b2 = 0.79  \n\ny = 13433* exp ( -0.0133* t )\nR\u00b2 = 0.75 \n\ny = 14182* exp ( -0.0081* t )\nR\u00b2 = 0.86\n\ny = 14921* exp ( -0.0068* t )\nR\u00b2 = 0.89 \n\nSOIL + OIL + AMNITE P1300  \n\nSOIL + OIL\n\nSOIL + OIL + NPK \n\nSOIL + OIL + NaN3                   \nFig 5.

CONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\nHydrocarbon-degrading bacteria counts were higher in the amended soils with \n\ntreatments T1, T2, and T3 ranging from 3.47 \u00d7 106 to 3.27 \u00d7 108 CFU/g compared to T4 \n\nthroughout the 90 days of study. Oil-contaminated soil in T1 showed the highest reduction in \n\ntotal petroleum hydrocarbon with net loss of 36.17 % throughout the 90 days of the \n\nexperiment compared to other treatments. The development of the microbial community and \n\nits recovery is a useful and sensitive way of monitoring the impact and recovery of used \n\nlubricating oil-contaminated soils. Commercially available microbial-based bioremediation \n\nproducts showed to be promising in the removal of petroleum hydrocarbons in contaminated \n\nclayey soil. \n\nKinetic model of biodegradation showed the highest biodegradation rate of 0.0283 \n\nday-1 and least half life of 24.49 days in oil contaminated soil with highest clayey and soil \n\norganic matter contents. This reveals the influence of organic matter and its biological roles in \n\nthe degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons contaminated soils. \n\nRemediation of hydrocarbons contaminated soil is necessary in order to have a safe \n\nand healthy environment that will in turn result in healthy lifestyle across the globe. \n\nBiological remediation of hydrocarbon and metal contaminated soil offers a better and more \n\nenvironmentally friendly technique that if properly and thoroughly explored can bring our \n\nenvironment into a better place for both plant and animal well-being due to its enormous \n\nadvantages over other treatment methods. However, despite these enormous advantages of \n\nbiological treatment method, its potential is yet to be fully utilized in restoration of \n\ncontaminated soil. This is possibly due to the fact that it takes a long period of time for the \n\ncomplete restoration of the environment; this limitation can however be overcome through \n\nnutrient addition and introduction of microbes with biodegradative capability to degrade \n\nhydrocarbons. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\n \n\n5.

The effect of other treatments conditions were also \ninvestigated on the microbial survival and used lubricating oil degradation. Artificially \ncontaminated soil types (clayey S1 and sandy S2) at a loading rate of 30000 and 45000 mg/kg \nin a 300 g model with used lubricating oil that was amended with commercially available \nhydrocarbon degrading microbial consortium: Amnite p1300 as the bioaugmentation (T1). \nThe effects of other treatments: nutrient amendments - (NH4)2SO4 and K2HPO4 (NPK) as \nbiostimulation treatment (T2), unammended soil - natural attenuation as (T3) and the control \nsoil treated with sodium azide (NaN3) as (T4) on the microbial community and the \ndegradation of used engine oil was also investigated.  The evaluation of soil biological \nactivities as a monitoring tool for the degradation process of the model soils was made via \nmeasurements of hydrocarbons degrading bacterial counts (HDB), soil respiration (CO2) and \npH. The correlations between these parameters and the levels of the hydrocarbon residues \nwere determined. The residual hydrocarbon content correlated negatively with hydrocarbon \nutilizers, CO2 evolution and pH in both soils, and the two levels of pollution. At the end of the \n90-day experiments, the highest percentage of oil biodegradation (82 and 64 %) was recorded \nin soils S1 and S2, respectively, contaminated with 30000 mg/kg used lubricating oil that was \namended with Amnite p1300, while only (68 and 62 %) of oil biodegradation was recorded in \nsoil S1 and S2, respectively contaminated with 45000 mg/kg used lubricating oil amended with \nAmnite p1300. The results revealed remediation potential of Amnite p1300 to degrade heavy \nhydrocarbons such as used lubricating oil. It is concluded that contamination of soil with oil \nhydrocarbons has a negative effect on soil ecosystems, and the extent and duration of these \neffects will depend on the soil characteristics. Thus, inhibitory effect of used lubricating oil is \nmore pronounced in sandy soil than in clayey soil and show more toxic effect on seed \ngermination and root growth. This study has also showed that soil microbiological parameters \nmay be useful tools for assessing the effect of hydrocarbon contamination on soil and \nenvironmental health.  \n \n\nKey words: Bioremediation, biodegradation, used lubricating oil, petroleum \nhydrocarbons, microbial consortium, soil pollution. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\n \n\nCap\u00edtulo 2 \n\nEFIC\u00c1CIA DO CONS\u00d3RCIO MICROBIANO NA BIODEGRADA\u00c7\u00c3O DE \u00d3LEO \nLUBRIFICANTES USADOS  EM SOLOS CONTAMINADOS DO BRASIL \n\n \nRESUMO \n \nO experimento foi realizado com o intuito de avaliar a efici\u00eancia de cons\u00f3rcio \n\nmicrobiano (Amnite p1300) na degrada\u00e7\u00e3o de hidrocarbonetos.

A avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da atividade \nbiol\u00f3gica do solo como instrumento de acompanhamento do processo de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o dos \nsolos foi realizada pela contagem das bact\u00e9rias que degradam hidrocarbonetos, respira\u00e7\u00e3o \ndo solo (evolu\u00e7\u00e3o de CO2) e pH.

INTRODUCTION \n \n\nThe rise in consumption of automotive lubricating oil is a worldwide problem and \n\nhas increased, ending in large used oil volume and its waste. In most of the developing \n\ncountries, the problems tend to worsen with economic and population growth, rapid \n\nindustrialization, and disregard for environmental health, particularly in relation to used \n\nmotor oil. The main component of the base oil is cyclic alkanes (c-alkanes). Long chain \n\nhydrocarbon and c-alkanes are known to be recalcitrant to microbial degradation. The base \n\noil contains C16-C36 hydrocarbon, and more than 75% c-alkanes. The ring numbers of c-\n\nalkanes in the base oil are from 1 to 3 and any ring contains 5 or 6 members. Most of the c-\n\nalkanes in the base oil have long alkyl side chains (Koma et al., 2003). After a period of \n\nusage of lubricating oil to lubricate parts of an automobile engine, in order to smooth engine \n\noperation, metals and heavy polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) get accumulated \n\n(Hagwell et al., 1992; Boonchan et al., 2000), and that would contribute to chronic hazard \n\nincluding mutagenicity and carcinogenicity (Butler and Mason, 1997). Prolonged exposure \n\nand high oil concentration may cause the development of liver or kidney disease, possible \n\ndamage to the bone marrow and increased risk of cancer (Mishra et al., 2001). In addition, \n\nPAHs have a widespread occurrence in various ecosystems that contribute to the persistence \n\nof these compounds in the environment (Van Hamme et al., 2003). Damage derived from \n\npetroleum hydrocarbon contamination will depend on the type and concentration of the \n\ncontaminant. It has generally been accepted that the susceptibility of hydrocarbons to \n\nmicrobial attack increases in the following order: cyclic alkanes &lt;low-molecular weight \n\naromatics &lt;branched alkanes &lt;n-alkanes  (Obbard et al., 2004). The toxicity of an organic \n\npollutant will also depend on the soil characteristics, the higher the soil cation exchange \n\ncapacity (high organic matter or clay content), the higher the adsorption of the organic \n\npollutant and the lower its toxic effect on the ecosystem (McBride, 1994). \n\nMechanical methods to reduce hydrocarbon pollution are expensive and time \n\nconsuming. The cheap, effective and safe method for reducing hydrocarbon pollution could \n\npossibly be done through microbial degradation. Biodegradation of complex hydrocarbon \n\nusually requires the cooperation of more than a single bacterial species. This is particularly \n\ntrue in pollutants that are made up of many different compounds such as petroleum \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\ncompounds and complete mineralization to CO2 and H2O is desired. Individual \n\nmicroorganisms can metabolize only a limited range of hydrocarbon substrates, so \n\nassemblages of mixed populations with overall broad enzymatic capacities are required to \n\nbring the rate and extent of petroleum biodegradation further. Microbes are the main \n\ndegraders of petroleum hydrocarbons contaminated ecosystems (Leahy and Cowell, 1990). \n\nBioremediation has become an alternative way of remediation of oil polluted sites, where \n\nthe addition of specific microorganisms (bacteria, cyanobacteria, algae, fungi, protozoa) or \n\nenhancement of microorganisms already present can improve biodegradation efficiency in \n\nboth in-situ or ex-situ procedures (Cookson, 1995). Activities of microorganisms are \n\nessential to nutrient cycling in soils, and any effect which pollution has on soil \n\nmicroorganisms will also affect vegetation development, ecosystem functioning and \n\nproductivity (Bauer et al., 1991; Ladd et al., 1996). Soil microorganisms are very sensitive \n\nto any ecosystem perturbation, since their diversity and activity are rapidly altered by such \n\nperturbation (Schloter et al., 2003). The measurement of microbiological parameters, such \n\nas soil respiration, microbial biomass, provides information on the presence and activity of \n\nviable microorganisms as well as on the intensity, kind and duration of the effects of \n\nhydrocarbon pollution on soil metabolic activity; such measurements may serve as a good \n\nindex of the impact of pollution on soil health (Brohon et al., 2001; Eibes et al., 2006). \n\nHowever, results on the effects of hydrocarbon pollution on microbial biomass and activity \n\nare not always coincident, probably due to the differences in chemical properties of the \n\nhydrocarbon used (Xu and Johnson, 1995). It is also true that contaminants may well serve \n\nas organic carbon sources, and an enrichment of oil-degrading microbial populations has \n\nbeen observed in most contaminated ecosystems (Margesin et al., 2000). A better \n\nunderstanding of the effect of hydrocarbon contaminants on plant and soil microorganisms \n\nmay be of help in assessing the recovery potential of a soil. \n\nConcentration of petroleum hydrocarbon determines to a greater extent the rate of \n\nbreakdown of the hydrocarbons from soil environment. High concentration of hydrocarbon \n\ninhibits microorganisms, and the concentration at which inhibition occurs varied with the \n\ncompound. Report of (Ijah and Antai, 2003) showed high degradation of hydrocarbons in \n\nsoil contaminated with 10% and 20% crude oil compared to those contaminated with 30 % \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\n \n\nand 40 % crude oil which experienced partial degradation of hydrocarbons within a period \n\nof 12 months. Rahman et al., (2002) reported that percentage of degradation by mixed \n\nbacterial consortium decreased from 70 % to 52 %, as the concentration of crude oil \n\nincreased from 2.5 % to 10 %. The work of Rambeloarisoa et al. (1984) also demonstrated \n\nthat crude oil degradation was inversely proportional to the concentration of oil. High \n\nconcentrations of hydrocarbons can be associated with heavy, undispersed oil slicks in \n\nwater, causing inhibition of oil biodegradation due to oxygen limitation or through toxic \n\neffects exerted by volatile hydrocarbons on microorganisms. Contamination by oil is \n\ngenerally expected to reduce the biodiversity of the soil microbiota (Atlas et al. 1991). A \n\nprobable explanation for this is that the addition of large amounts of hydrocarbons selects \n\nfor a limited number of fast-growing hydrocarbon degraders, which are enriched in the \n\n(typically oligotrophic) soil environment under these conditions. However, there is a lack of \n\ninformation on how this may be modulated by differing complex environmental matrices, \n\nand in particular, how different soil types and contamination level may affect the \n\ndevelopment of hydrocarbon-degrading populations. Previous microcosm studies examining \n\nthe effect of oil contamination on soil microbial communities have focused on a single soil \n\ntype (e.g. Engelen et al., 1998; Macnaughton et al., 1999). Adeyemo et al., (2012) compared \n\none level (1.5 % w/w) of hydrocarbon contamination in two clayey soils and a sandy soil. \n\nW\u00fcnsche et al., (1995) also investigated hydrocarbon contamination in two different soil \n\ntypes. However, as one was a historically contaminated refinery soil and one was a \n\ncontaminated pristine arable soil, it was not possible to separate the effects of soil type and \n\ndiffering oil treatment. It has been shown that even a simple measure of microbial response \n\nto oil contamination, such as a toxicity bioassay, gives different responses in different soil \n\ntypes (Marwood et al. 1998), it is therefore very important to understand how different soil \n\ntypes and contamination of hydrocarbons affect the biodegradation of used lubricating oil. \n\nThe objectives of this work were to investigate the potential use of commercial hydrocarbon \n\ndegrading bacteria consortium for degrading heavy hydrocarbons in used lubricating oil, \n\nand to utilize the commercial bacterial for the possible enhancement of used lubricating oil \n\nbiodegradation in two different soil types (one clayey and one sandy) differing in their clay \n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n\n \n\nand organic matter content under laboratory conditions at different oil pollution (3.0 % w/w \n\nand 4.5 % w/w) concentrations. \n\n \n\n2. MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n2.1. Soil sample. The soil sample used was collected from two locations in Minas \n\nGerais, Brazil with no known history of petroleum product contamination. A single large \n\ncore was collected for each soil type from the A horizon, not including the surface litter \n\nlayer, kept in a hermetic bag and transported to the laboratory for analysis. The soil was \n\nsieved using a 5 mm diameter stainless sieve. The characteristics which were determined \n\nusing standard techniques are as listed in Table 1. Used lubricating oil was collected from a \n\ngasoline and car service station in close proximity to the Federal University of Vi\u00e7osa, \n\nVi\u00e7osa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Amnite p1300 special microbial consortium specially made to \n\ndegrade used motor oil were obtained from Cleveland Biotech Ltd., UK. \n\nTable 1: Selected physical and chemical characteristics of the noncontaminated soil samples \nParameters   Soil 1 (S1)    Soil 2 (S2) \n\npH (H20)  5.20     4.92 \n\nTotal Nitrogen (%) 0.43     0.11 \n\nAvail.

Soil analysis. Table 1 shows the origin and selected physical and chemical \n\ncharacteristics of the noncontaminated soil samples used for the bioremediation studies. \n\nNitrogen content of the soil was determined by using Kjeldahl method, the available \n\nphosphorus was analysed by colometry after Mehlich 1 extraction and Organic Carbon \n\ncontent was determined using a modifield Walkley-Black (1934) method. The pH was \n\ndetermined using 1:2.5 ratio by weight with distilled water (w/v) after 30-min equilibration \n\nusing a pH meter and electrode calibrated with pH 4.0 and 7.0 standards. Determinations were \n\nmade in triplicate.  \n\n \n\n2.3. Soil microcosms. The artificially contaminated model 300 g of soils were \n\nmanually mixed with used lubricating oil at room temperature of (25 \u00b1 1 oC) under laboratory \n\nconditions.  The soil was spread evenly and thinly in a large glass dish; the oil was added at a \n\nlevel of 30000 mg/kg and 45000 mg/kg dry weight of soil (3 % and 4.5 % w/w) respectively, \n\npoured evenly over the surface, and then mixed with a stainless steel spatula for 5 min before \n\ntransferring to the microcosm (one litre (1L) glass flasks sealed with teflon-lined rubber \n\nstoppers). Since it is common for authentically-contaminated soils to have similar or higher \n\noil concentrations (e.g. Saterbak et al. 1999), the concentrations of the added oil was similar \n\nto earlier microcosm studies (e.g. W\u00fcnsche et al. 1995). The microcosms were used to \n\nsimulate the comparative effect of spent oil addition and bioremediation using a commercially \n\navailable hydrocarbon degrading microbial consortium (Amnite p1300), special microbial \n\nconsortium consisting of a mixture of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Pseudomonas \n\nputida, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Rhodococcus rhodocrous \n\non a cereal (bran) as the bioaugmentation treatment. The microorganisms were conditioned to \n\ndegrade heavy hydrocarbons. The concentration of microbial population in Amnite p1300 was \n\napproximately 5 x 108 cfu/g of bran. In addition to bioaugmentation using microbial \n\nconsortium, the polluted soils were amended with ((NH4)2SO4 and K2HPO4) as biostimulation \n\ntreatments. The C:N:P ratio of the nutrient compound was adjusted to 100:7.5:1 (optimum \n\nconditions), similar conditions provided in the biostimulation treatment were adopted in the \n\nbioaugmentation treatments plus the addition of Amnite p1300. The unammended soil \n\nwithout addition of nutrients and bacterial inoculums (natural attenuation), was included to \n\nindicate hydrocarbon degradation capability of microorganisms naturally present in the \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n\n \n\ncontaminated soils (i.e. the autochthonous microbes). There was a control soil in which most \n\nof the indigenous bacteria were killed by the addition of biocide sodium azide (NaN3) (0.3% \n\nw/w) to inhibit soil microorganisms and to monitor abiotic hydrocarbon losses on the \n\nmicrobial community in two different soil types. There were six sampling dates; hence 48 \n\nmicrocosms in total were used. Microcosms were arranged in a random order, and rearranged \n\nevery 2 weeks \u00b1 2 days throughout the duration of the experiment. The treatments were set up \n\nin triplicate, while the content of each container was tilled every week for aeration, and the \n\nmoisture content was maintained at 70 % water holding capacity by the addition of sterile \n\ndistilled water every week throughout the period of the experiment (90 days) (Pramer and \n\nBartha, 1972).   \n\n2.4. Gravimetric measurement of used lubricating oil loss in soil. The extents of \n\nused lubricating oil biodegradation in soil were also determined gravimetrically after \n\nmicrowave extraction according to the EPA method 3546 (US EPA, 2007) using the \n\nMicrowave Automated Reaction System from CEM (Matthews, NC). Briefly, Sodium sulfate \n\n(Na2SO4) was purified by drying overnight in an oven at 150\u00b0C and quickly transferred into a \n\ndesiccators. Five grams (5 g) of homogenised contaminated soil was weighed out, mixed with \n\n5 g dry anhydrous Na2SO4 and ground to less than 1 mm particle sizes, extracted in \n\nGreenChem vessels with 25 mL of a 1:1 hexane:acetone mixture according to manufacturer\u2019s \n\nprotocol at 100 \u00b0C for 20 minutes.  The n-hexane and acetone was filtered through whatman \n\nNo 1 filter paper to separate the extract from the soil particles, and transferred into 100 mL \n\namber vials through separatory funnel and sequentially rinsed with equal volume of solvent \n\nmixture. The solvent \u2013 oil mixture was later transferred into 100 mL Florentine flask of \n\nknown weight, the solvent was evaporated into a partial dryness using rotary evaporator \n\n(Fizatom Rotavapor 801), and later completely using nitrogen gas. The new weight of the \n\nflask (now containing residual oil) was recorded. Percentage biodegradation of used \n\nlubricating oil was calculated using the formula of Ijah and Ukpe (1992):  \n\n \n\n% ???????????????????????????? = ????????? ??? ????  ??????  \n(?????????????? )? ???????? ??? ????  ??????

Total Petroleum \n\nHydrocarbons (TPHs) were extracted according to EPA method 3546 (US EPA, 2007) using \n\nthe Microwave Automated Reaction System from CEM (Matthews, NC). Briefly, sodium \n\nsulfate (Na2SO4) was purified by drying overnight in an oven at 150\u00b0C and quickly \n\ntransferred into a desiccators. Five grams (5 g) of homogenized contaminated soil was \n\nweighed out, mixed with 5 g dry anhydrous Na2SO4 and ground to less than 1 mm particle \n\nsizes and extracted in a 25 mL GreenChem vessels containing 1:1 hexane : acetone mixture \n\naccording to manufacturer\u2019s protocol, and were kept at 100 \u00b0C for 20 minutes.  The n-hexane \n\nand acetone mixture was filtered through whatman No 1 filter paper to separate the extract \n\nfrom the soil particles, and transferred into 100 mL amber vials through separatory funnel \n\nwhich was sequentially rinsed with equal volume of solvent mixture. The solvent were \n\nevaporated to partial dryness with a rotary evaporator (Fizatom Rotavapor 801), transferred \n\ninto 2 mL vials and then dried completely using nitrogen gas. Dried samples were dissolved \n\nin 600 \u00b5L dichloromethane for gas chromatography analysis. The residual oil was analyzed \n\non Shimadzu GC-17A chromatograph equipped with a Flame-Ionization Detector (FID) by \n\nusing fused silica capillary column DB-5 (30 x 0.25 mm), and AOC-17 Shimadzu auto \n\ninjector complying with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standard method 8015 (US \n\nEPA 2007). The flow rate of the helium carrier gas was 1.81 mL/min with linear velocity of \n\n38.49 cm/s. The initial temperature was programmed at 40oC and held for 15 min. The \n\ntemperature was then increased to 280oC at a rate of 10oC /min. The final temperature was \n\nheld for 31 min. The injector was set in the split mode. The split ratio was set to 1:10; the \n\ninjection volume was 1 \u00b5L and the injector and the detector temperature for GC were \n\nmaintained at 260 and 280\u00b0C respectively and the oven temperature was programmed to rise \n\nfrom 40 to 280\u00b0C in 10\u00b0C/min increments and to hold at 280\u00b0C for 31 min. The dry weight of \n\nthe soil samples was determined following baking of 10 g of wet soil at > 80 \u00b0C for at least 48 \n\nhours. Before analyzing the sample extract, a mixture of standards including n-alkanes (n-\n\ndecane n-C10, n-dodecane n-C12, n-tetradecane n-C14, n-hexadecane n-C16, n-octadecane n-\n\nC18, n-eicosane n-C20, n-docosane n-C22, n-tetracosane n-C24, n-hexacosane n-C26, n-\n\noctacosane n-C28 and a pure standards containing n-triacontane n-C30, n-dotriacontane n-C32, n-\ntetratriacontane n-C34, and n-hexatriacontane n-C36, and a mixture of polycyclic aromatic \n\nhydrocarbon consisting of acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, anthracene, benzo (a) anthracene, benzo (a) \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\n \n\npyrene, benzo (b) fluoranthene, benzo (g, h, i) perylene, benzo (k) fluoranthene, chrysene, dibenz (a, \n\nh) anthracene, fluoranthene,fluorine, indeno (1, 2, 3-cd) pyrene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene, 1-\n\nmethylnaphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene, Supelco) were used for calibration. Five points \n\ncalibration curves using peak areas were obtained and the response factors were used to determine the \n\nconcentrations of various hydrocarbons in the sample extract. The total petroleum hydrocarbons \n\nwere identified and quantified by comparing the peak area of samples with that of the \n\nstandard of the TPH mixture with reference to the curve derived from standards. Percentage \n\nof degradation was calculated by the following expression:  \n\n% ???????????????????????????? = ??????? ??????????????  \u2013 ?????? ??????????????????\n?????? ??????????????\n\n? \u00d7 100                                             (2)          \n \nTPH data were fitted to the first-order kinetics model (Yeung et al., 1997): \n \n ?? = ??0 ??(?????)                                                                                                                            (3) \n \n\nWhere H is the residual hydrocarbon content in soil (mg/kg), H0 is the initial hydrocarbon \n\ncontent in soil (mg/kg), k is the biodegradation rate constant (day-1) and t is time (days). This \n\nmodel was based on the assumption that the degradation rate of hydrocarbons positively \n\ncorrelated with the hydrocarbon pool size in soil.  The model was used to estimate the rate of \n\nbiodegradation and half-life of hydrocarbons in soil under each treatment. The biodegradation \n\nrate constant (k), and half-life ln(2)/k of the hydrocarbons in soil during the bioremediation \n\nprocess were calculated from the model using Statistical \u00ae software (Stat Soft. Inc. (2007).  \n\n \n\n2.6. Enumeration of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria. The study was conducted at \n\nroom temperature and the enumeration was carried out at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 days. To \n\nmonitor cell numbers and biodegradation, 1 g of soil was removed from each microcosm at \n\nthe set times and suspended in 9 mL of saline solution in sterile centrifuge tubes. The mixture \n\nwas vigorously shaken on a vortex mixer for 3 minutes and then the soil particulates were \n\nallowed to settle for 1 min before 0.1 mL of the supernatant fluids were sampled for CFU \n\ncounts. The number of colony-forming hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (HDB) was done by \n\nplating three replicate samples from each treatment withdrawn every 15 days on a mineral \n\nmedium containing used motor oil as the sole carbon source. The mineral medium contained \n\n1.8 g K2HPO4, 4.0 g NH4Cl, 0.2 g MgSO4.7H2O, 1.2 g KH2PO4, 0.01 g FeSO4.7H2O, 0.1 g \n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\n \n\nNaCl, 20 g agar, one percent (1%) used engine oil in 1,000 mL distilled water, and the \n\nmedium was adjusted to  pH 7.4 (Zajic and Supplission, 1972). The oil agar plates were \n\nincubated at 30\u00b0C for 7 days before the colonies were counted.  \n\n2.7. Soil respiration. Amended-moist soil corresponding to a 300 g dry soil with \n\nwater holding capacity (WHC) of approximately 70 % was incubated in triplicate at (25 \u00b1 1 \n0C) under laboratory conditions, in one Litre (1L) glass flasks sealed with teflon-lined rubber \n\nstoppers. Microbial activity was monitored by analyzing CO2 accumulation in the headspace \n\nby gas chromatography. Headspace samples of 1 cm3 were taken from microcosms with a \n\nHamilton gastight\u00ae syringe and injected into a Gas Chromatograph Model GC- 14B \n\n(Shimadzu Crop Kyoto Japan ), with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD ) at temperature of \n\n150 \u00b0 C, injector at 100 \u00ba C and Porapak -Q column at 50 \u00ba C, using nitrogen as a carrier gas. \n\nRespiration rate was expressed as evolved CO2 in mL CO2 m-2 h-1, and the accumulated CO2 \n\nconcentration in mg CO2/ kg of dried soil. The amount of CO2 evolved during the \n\nmineralization of used lubricating oil was monitored using the accumulated concentration of \n\nCO2 recorded from the CG-TCD. Microcosms were aerated for 15 min after CO2 \n\nmeasurement to maintain oxygen levels in the system. Microcosms were set up in triplicate in \n\ntightly closed glass flasks. To determine metabolic activity in each microcosm, respiration \n\nthrough CO2 emission monitoring were periodically performed. Each 1-L glass flask \n\ncontained 300 g moist soils to which used lubricating oil was added. The respiration mean of \n\nthe blanks was subtracted from the treated microcosms, and the difference in CO2 production \n\nbetween the blanks and the treated microcosms was used as the amount of CO2 produced. \n\nAnalysis of released CO2 was done in triplicate, and data were subjected to statistical analysis \n\nusing general linear model of analysis of variance (ANOVA). Significant treatment means \n\nwere compared using Tukey test at P > 0.05 (Statistical Software 8.0: Stat. Soft, 2007), to \n\ndetermine the significance of differences between microcosms. \n\n \n\n2.8. Germination toxicity test for the remediated soil. Toxicity of the remediated \n\nsoils was assessed by germination tests using wheat seeds. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) was \n\nused in this study owing to its sensitivity to hydrocarbon in soil (Banks and Schultz, 2005). \n\nThe germination test was conducted over a 7-day test period. Seeds of wheat were obtained \n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\ncommercially. For each soil sample, 150 g of thoroughly mixed remediated soil was placed in \n\n110 \u00d7 110 x 35 mm germination box.  Twenty viable seeds of wheat were added and evenly \n\nspread into each germination box. Three replicates of the samples were prepared. The \n\nmoisture of the soil (each soil) was maintained at 80 % water holding capacity. Germination \n\nboxes were incubated for 7 days in a plant test chamber with photoperiod of 16 h light and 8 h \n\ndark at 20 oC.

Biodegradation of used lubricating oil. Following a better biodegradation extent \n\nin our earlier studies using only one contamination level in three types of soils (Adeyemo et \n\nal., 2012), the biodegradation of used lubricating oil was studied using Aminte p1300, a \n\ncommercial bacterial consortium, was investigated. Trends in the biodegradation percentage \n\nin the soil contaminated with 3.0% and 4.5% used lubricating oil are shown in Fig.1   \n\n\n\n \n\n51 \n\n \n\n   \n\n    \n\nFigure 1: Biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbon in soil contaminated with 3.5 and 4.5% used lubricating oil in soil 1 (S1) and Soil 2 (S2). \nVertical bars indicate standard error of the mean SE (n = 3). \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n%\n\n O\nil \n\nde\nga\n\nra\nda\n\nti\non\n\nClayey + 3.0 %\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n%\n O\n\nil \nde\n\ngr\nad\n\nat\nio\n\nn\n\nClayey Loamy Sand + 3.0 %\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nSOIL+OIL+P1300 SOIL+OIL+NPK SOIL+OIL SOIL+OIL+NaN3\n\n%\n O\n\nil \nde\n\ngr\nad\n\nat\nio\n\nn\n\nTreatments\n\nClayey + 4.5 %\n\n15 30 45 60 75 90\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nSOIL+OIL+P1300 SOIL+OIL+NPK SOIL+OIL SOIL+OIL+NaN3\n\n%\n O\n\nil \nde\n\ngr\nad\n\nat\nio\n\nn\n\nTreatments\n\nClayey Loamy Sand + 4.5 %\n\n15 30 45 60 75 90\n\n\n\n \n\n52 \n\n \n\nThe results showed the highest biodegradation percentage (84% and 64%) in soil 1 (S1) and \n\nsoil 2 (S2), respectively, contaminated with 3.0% of the used lubricating oil amended with \n\nAmnite p1300 (T1) compared to (65% and 52%) in T2; (49% and 33%) in T3 and (10% and \n\n7%) in T4 at the end of 90-day experiment. A higher degradation percentage observed in S1 \n\ncompared to S2 in this study might be due to the higher clay contents of S1. Soils of high clay \n\ncontents have been shown to offer greater capacity for physicochemical attenuation of \n\ncontaminants than coarse sands (Pye and Patrick, 1983). The low percentage of contamination \n\nwith (3.0%) used lubricating oil might be the reason for the relatively high and progressive \n\nbiodegradation in the soil, because it does not pose a serious challenge to the metabolic \n\nactivities of soil microorganisms. It may also be due to the mixed bacterial consortium that is \n\npresent in T1 that combine individual\u2019s effect of the bacterial strains for better degradation \n\n(Rahman et al., 2002; Ghazali et al., 2004). With the increase in the concentration of the \n\ncontaminated soils (4.5%), lower percentage of degradation (71% and 62 %) was observed in \n\nS1 and S2, respectively, in T1 compared to the previous level of contamination (3.0%). Similar \n\ntrends were recorded in soil contaminated with 4.5% in T2, T3 and T4 (53% and 45%), (35% \n\nand 24%) and (6% and 5%) respectively. This may be attributed to the toxicity of the oil on \n\nthe microbial flora of the soil and thus the high concentration of oil which might likely had \n\nnegative effects on the biodegradative activities of the microbial population in the \n\ncontaminated soil. (Adesodun and Mbagwu, 2008). Higher degradation was observed in our \n\nprevious work (Adeyemo et al., 2012) with reduced concentration of the used motor oil in soil \n\nfollowing application of microbial consortium (Amnite p1300) with the same treatment. The \n\nresult is in agreement with the findings of Rahman et al., (2002) who reported decrease in the \n\nrate of biodegradation of crude oil, as the concentration of oil increased.  \n\n \n\nThe results of this present study show that highest biodegradation rates were recorded \n\nin soil contaminated with 3% oil compared with 4.5%. This high biodegradation rate could be \n\nattributed to increase in the activity of soil microbes in the oil polluted soils (Adesodun and \n\nMbagwu, 2008). Amnite p1300 (T1) amended soil recorded highest percentage \n\nbiodegradation (84% and 64%) in 3% oil-contamination and (71% and 62 %) in 4.5% oil \n\ncontamination in S1 and S2, respectively, throughout the 90-day period, compared to the \n\npoisoned control soil treated with sodium azide which recorded 10% and 7% in 3% oil-\n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n\n \n\ncontamination and (6% and 5%) in 4.5% oil contamination in S1 and S2, respectively. This \n\nmight be due to the combined effect of hydrocarbon-utilizing microbial consortium present in \n\nthe T1. The vendor (Cleveland Biotech, UK) of the microbial consortium claimed that the \n\nconsortium (Amnite p1300) had been conditioned to carry out effective and efficient \n\nbiodegradative activities of heavy petroleum hydrocarbons.  Some removal of hydrocarbons \n\nwas also seen in the soil which was not amended with commercial bacterial consortium. This \n\nremoval could be attributed to the combined actions of indigenous microbial population \n\nstimulated by the addition of nutrients to the polluted soil as well as abiotic weathering. \n\nAbiotic weathering processes in polluted soils include evaporation, photochemical oxidation, \n\nand adsorption onto particulate material. \n\n \n\n3.2. Biodegradation rate and coefficient of determination. The first-order \n\ndegradation kinetics was reported in earlier studies based on petroleum hydrocarbon \n\ndegradations (van Gestel et al., 2003; Namkoong et al., 2002; J\u00f8rgensen et al., 2000). First-\n\norder kinetic model of Yeung et al. (1997) was adopted in this study to evaluate the \n\nbiodegradation of used lubricating oil in all treatments (T1, T2, T3 and T4) as presented in \n\nTable 2. Biodegradation rate constant (k) of the hydrocarbons during the bioremediation \n\nprocess and coefficient of determination r\u00b2 were calculated from the model. Data from three \n\nreplicates in each treatment from the six sampling periods (two weeks interval) were \n\ncombined for evaluation using this model. The coefficients of determination (r\u00b2) revealed that \n\nthe model fits well to all the treatments. The highest biodegradation rates of 0.0201 and \n\n0.0160/day were recorded in soil contaminated with 3.0% amended with Amnite P1300 in S1 \n\nand S2, respectively. In soil contaminated with 4.5%, the highest biodegradation rate of \n\n0.0122 and 0.0117/day were also recorded in the treatment amended with Aminte p1300 in S1 \n\nand S2 respectively. Poisoned control amended with sodium azide recorded the lowest \n\nbiodegradation rate of (0.0011 and 0.0010/day) in 3.0% and (0.0007 and 0.0007/day) in 4.5% \n\noil contamination in S1 and S2 respectively. The results show significant relationships \n\nbetween the rate of biodegradation and concentration of oil in the contaminated soil. It is \n\nnoticeable that biodegradation rate in 4.5% oil contamination were lower compared with 3.0% \n\nin both soils. This observation might be attributed to the toxicity of the oil on the microbial \n\nbiota of the soil. High concentrations of the oil have negatively affected the biodegradative \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n\n \n\nactivities of the microbial population in the contaminated soil. (Adesodun and Mbagwu, \n\n2008). \n \nTable 2: First-order biodegradation parameters of hydrocarbon in used lubricating oil-contaminated soils.  \n \n\n  \nTreatments             K (day-1)       R\u00b2            \n \n _____________________________________________________________________________ \n       S1        S2   S1    S2  \n                           \n \n3.0%  \n \nT1  0.0201Db  0.0160Da  0.98  0.96 \n  \n\n     T2  0.0154Cb  0.0126Ca  0.78  0.94 \n \nT3  0.0080Bb  0.0062Ba  0.90  0.98 \n  \nT4  0.0011Ab  0.0010Aa  0.97  0.95 \n \n4.5% \n \nT1   0.0122Da  0.0117Da  0.92  0.89 \n  \n\n     T2  0.0071Ca  0.0075Ca  0.74  0.93 \n \nT3  0.0021Ba  0.0021Ba  0.70  0.82 \n  \nT4  0.0007Aa  0.0007Aa  0.96  0.74 \n   \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \nT1=soil + oil + Amnite P1300, T2= soil + oil + (NH4)2SO4 and K2HPO4), T3 = soil + oil alone, T4 = unamended contaminated control soil \nwith sodium azide.

Differences between the two soils S1 and S2, however, were not \n\nsignificant (P &lt;0.05) with respect to the biogradation rate. As the oil contamination increased \n\nto 4.5%, the less efficiency of the commercial microbial consortium with heavy application of \n\nused lubricating oil could be attributed to reduction in the activity of the soil microbes at this \n\nlevel of pollution in both soils. Bossert and Bartha (1984) stated that sensitivity of soil micro \n\nbiota to petroleum hydrocarbons is a factor of quantity and quality of oil spilled and previous \n\nexposure of the native soil microbes to oil. Although, La-Rue (1977) reported that most \n\nmicrobes can metabolized a wide range of c-compounds, Schwindinger (1968) stated that \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\n \n\nbeyond 3.0% concentration, oil becomes increasingly deleterious to soil biota and crop \n\ngrowth. Schaefer and Juliane (2007) also concluded that bioremediation is a useful method of \n\nsoil remediation if pollutant concentrations are moderate.  \n\n \n\n3.3. Enumeration of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria. The hydrocarbon degrading \n\nbacterial (HDB) counts in T1 contaminated with 3 % ranged from (4.5 x 106 to 2.8 x 108 \n\nCFU/g) in S1 and (4 x 106 to 2.5 x 108 CFU/g) in S2. The hydrocarbon degrading bacterial \n\ncounts was slightly higher in S1 than S2. A similar trend was recorded in soil contaminated \n\nwith 4.5 % in T1, with lower microbial population ranging from (1.28 x 106 to 6.4 x 107 \n\nCFU/g) in S1 and (1.08 x 106 to 5.7 x 107 CFU/g) in S2. The reason might be due to its clay \n\ncontents through surface adsorption and microbial metabolism in this soil which has been \n\nshown to offer greater capacity for physicochemical attenuation of contaminants than coarse \n\nsands. (Pye and Patrick, 1983). The high clay soil may also contain active organisms whose \n\nmetabolism results in contaminant attenuation than coarse sands. The low percentage of \n\ncontamination with (3.0 %) used lubricating oil might be the reason for the relatively high and \n\nprogressive biodegradation in the soil. The low percentage oil contamination appeared not to \n\npose serious challenge to the metabolic activities of soil microorganisms. The population of \n\nhydrocarbons degrading microbial counts were highest in T1 followed by T2 and T3. Control \n\nT4 has the least counts in both soils used for the experiment. This result clearly demonstrates \n\nthe benefit of bioaugmentation of oil polluted soil with Aminte p1300 products. An enhanced \n\ncomparison between the four treatments investigated in this work is revealed in Fig. 2. In the \n\ncontrol treatment (T4), most of the indigenous bacteria were killed with a biocide (NaN3). The \n\nnumber of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms increased with time both at the \n\ncontamination levels and the two soils. Already after 15 days, the counts of degrading \n\nbacterial consortium on used lubricating oil hydrocarbon showed that soil microorganisms \n\nadapted rapidly to the hydrocarbon contamination and were able to utilize the spent oil as \n\ncarbon source (Fig. 2). The counts of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria (HDB) in both level of \n\ncontamination (3.0% and 4.5%) in T2 were lower than T1, but, appreciably higher compared \n\nto T3 and T4. The reason for higher counts of bacteria in T2 soil might be as a result of \n\npresence of appreciable quantities of available nutrients added, which are necessary for \n\nbacterial biodegradative activities (Abdulsalam et al., 2011). \n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n\n \n\n             \n\nClayey + 3.0 %\n\nH\nD\n\nB\n C\n\nou\nnt\n\ns \n(L\n\nog\n C\n\nFU\n/g\n\n)\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nClayey + 3.0 %\n\nH\nD\n\nB\n C\n\nou\nnt\n\ns \n(L\n\nog\n C\n\nFU\n/g\n\n)\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n \n\nClayey + 4.5 %\n\nTime (days)\n\n0 15 30 45 60 75 90\n\nH\nD\n\nB\n C\n\nou\nnt\n\ns \n(L\n\nog\n C\n\nFU\n/g\n\n)\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nSOIL+OIL+P1300 SOIL+OIL+NPK \n\nSOIL+OIL SOIL+OIL+NaN3 \n\nClay Loamy Sand + 4.5 %\n\nTime (days)\n\n0 15 30 45 60 75 90\n\nH\nD\n\nB\n C\n\nou\nnt\n\ns \n(L\n\nog\n C\n\nFU\n/g\n\n)\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nSOIL+OIL+P1300 \n\nSOIL+OIL \nSOIL+OIL+NPK \n\nSOIL+OIL+NaN3  \nFig. 2: Hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (HDB) counts in soils contaminated with 3.0 and 4.5 % used lubricating oil.

The values of CO2 evolved during a \n\n90-day incubation experiment from soil samples at different times in 3.0 % and 4.5 % level of \n\ncontamination are shown in Fig. 3 and 4 respectively. CO2 emissions were higher in the \n\nclayey soil than in the sandy soil both for the contaminated and the control treatments. This \n\nmight be due to its higher nutrient contents and microbial metabolism in this clayey soil \n\nwhich has been shown to offer greater capacity for physicochemical attenuation of \n\ncontaminants than coarse sands. (Pye and Patrick, 1983).  \n\nThe contaminants at the two loading rates (3 and 4.5 %) assayed, increased soil \n\nrespiration in both soils, especially in the clayey soil. In the clayey soil, used lubricating oil \n\ncontaminated soils showed that respiration in 3.0 % loading rates producing the greatest CO2 \n\nemissions. The high amount of CO2 liberated in clayey soil amended with amnite products \n\nand contaminated with 3 % and 4.5 % used lubricating oil is an indication of high utilization \n\nof organic carbon nutrients from the petroleum hydrocarbons present in this sample. The \n\nexception to this trends was that respiration rate of the samples with higher contamination \n\nlevel of 4.5 % used lubricating oil was lower compared with the soils contaminated with 3 %. \n\nThis may be due to reduced aeration caused by the very high hydrocarbon concentrations in \n\nthe soils.  \n\nThe stimulatory effect of used lubricating oil on soil respiration persisted in both soils \n\nthroughout the incubation period, and was still noticeable 90 days after contamination (Fig. 3 \n\nand 4). The cumulative evolution of CO2 in the clayey soil (S1) at both level of contamination \n\n(3.0% and 4.5 %) in the amended treatments with amnite products (T1) were higher than \n\ntreatments amended with nutrients (T2) in (3.0% and 4.5 %) level of contamination. The \n\nlower values recorded in both soils contaminated with 4.5 % might be due to the toxicity of \n\nthe spent motor oil to the microorganisms present in the contaminated soils or reduced \n\naeration caused by the very high hydrocarbon concentrations in the soils. Soil respiration (in \n\nterms of carbon dioxide - CO2-evolution) in T1 and T2 were significantly higher than in T3 \n\nand T4. The CO2- evolution in T4 reached maximum values after 30 days, decreasing \n\nthereafter and remaining almost constant till the end of the 90- day experiment.

Toxicity and seed germination index. In both soils, the seed germination test \n\nwas conducted using wheat sown on the oil polluted soils at both 3.0% and 4.5%. Wheat is an \n\nimportant agricultural crops, and its sensitivity to toxic chemicals (mostly petroleum \n\ncontaminants), has led to its wide use for toxicity tests (Banks and Schultz, 2005). The trends \n\nin seed germination on the bacteria-remediated soils that was contaminated with 3.0% and 4.5 \n\n% spent oil are shown in Table 3.  At the end of the 90-day experiment, the results revealed \n\nthat 100 %, 80 % and 60 % germination were recorded in 3.0 % soil contamination and 90 %, \n\n60 % and 30 % were recorded in soil contaminated with 4.5 % oil in T1, T2 and T3, \n\nrespectively, in Soil 1(S1). While 90 %, 70 % and 60 % germination were recorded in 3.0 % \n\nsoil contamination, 70 %, 60 % and 20 % germination were recorded in soil contaminated \n\nwith 4.5% oil in T1, T2 and T3, respectively, in Soil 2 (S2). Highest percent germination \n\n(100%) was recorded in uncontaminated control in both S1 and S2 at both levels of \n\ncontamination, while only 30 % and 20 % in S1 and 20% and 10%) in S2 were recorded in \n\npoisoned control soils (T4) which were contaminated with 3.0% and 4.5% used lubricating \n\noil, respectively. It is evidenced that the type of soil also influenced the phytotoxic effect, \n\nwhich was more persistent in the sandy soil. The toxicity of an organic pollutant will also \n\ndepend on the soil characteristics. The higher the soil cation exchange capacity (high organic \n\nmatter and/or clay content), the higher the adsorption of the organic pollutant and the lower its \n\ntoxic effect on the ecosystem (McBride, 1994). In the clayey soil (S1), the inhibitory effect \n\nwas not really pronounced, probably due to the degradation of some of the phytotoxic \n\ncompounds contained in the hydrocarbons (the resulting metabolites being less phytotoxic). \n\nSequestration and bound-residue formation could also have occurred during organic \n\ncontaminant degradation in soil, because bound or nonextractable residues (NER) are formed. \n\nPart of these residues may be biogenic, because degrading microorganisms assimilate carbon \n\nderived from the pollutant and mineralized CO2 to form cellular components, for example, \n\n[fatty acids (FA) and amino acids (AA), which are subsequently stabilized within soil organic \n\nmatter (SOM) (Scheunert et al., 1985; Karolina et al., 2011). In the sandy soil, the \n\nphytotoxicity was higher, perhaps due to a lower degree of hydrocarbon degradation as a  \n\n\n\n \n\n61 \n\n \n\nTable 3: Toxicity test based on seed germination (%) \n\nPercentage     Treatments \n\nOil pollution  T1  T2  T3  T4  T5  \n\nS1 (3%)   100  80  60  30  100 \n \nS1 (4.5%)    90  60  30  20  100 \n \nS2 (3%)     90  70  60  20  100 \n \nS2 (4.5%)    70  60  20  10  100 \nT1=soil + oil + Amnite P1300, T2= soil + oil + (NH4)2SO4 and K2HPO4), T3 = soil + oil alone, T4 = unamended \ncontaminated control soil with sodium azide., T5 = uncontaminated soil , S1 = Red Latosol,  S2 = Red-yellowish \nlatosol \n \n\nTable 4:  Seed germination toxicity index (%)   \n\nPercentage     Treatments \n\nOil pollution  T1         T2                T3         T4   \n\nS1 (3%)   93.33          49.34    21.20           4.01  \n   \nS1 (4.5%)  76.71          27.00    7.95           1.93  \n \nS2 (3%)   74.97           36.05    16.92          2.50  \n \nS2 (4.5%)  52.71           24.60    4.68          0.85  \nT1=soil + oil + Amnite P1300, T2= soil + oil + (NH4)2SO4 and K2HPO4), T3 = soil + oil alone, T4 = unamended \ncontaminated control soil with sodium azide., S1 =  Red Latosol,  S2 =  Red-yellowish latosol \n \n \nconsequence of the low microbial biomass content and microbial activity of this soil. The \n\nGermination Index (GI) gives an idea of the effect of soil contamination on the seed \n\ngermination and root growth. Germination index of wheat seed on the remediated soil was \n\ncalculated using the formula of Millioli et al. (2009).  The soils contaminated with used \n\nlubricating oil had a stimulatory effect on the seeds germination at higher concentration of \n\n4.5% than 3.0%. Table 4 shows the results of seed germination index in soil contaminated \n\nwith 3.0% and 4.5% used lubricating oil in all the treatments. Soil treated with Amnite p1300 \n\nrecorded the highest germination index, 93.33%, and 76.71% in S1 and 74.97 and 52.71% in \n\nS2, this result further proved the effectiveness of the commercial bacterial consortium in \n\nenhancing biodegradation of hydrocarbon in soil contaminated with used lubricating oil. The \n\n\n\n \n\n62 \n\n \n\nnegative effect of hydrocarbons on GI may be attributed to their inherent toxicity and/or to the \n\nperturbations they cause in soil and plants due to their hydrophobic properties (Ogboghodo et \n\nal., 2004). Hydrocarbons may coat roots, preventing or reducing gas and water exchange and \n\nnutrient absorption. They may also enter the seeds and alter the metabolic reactions and/or kill \n\nthe embryo by direct, acute toxicity. After penetrating the plant tissues, hydrocarbons damage \n\ncell membranes and reduce the metabolic transport and respiration rate (Amadi et al., 1992; \n\nXu and Johnson, 1995). Xu and Johnson (1995) indicated that the contaminant could have \n\nopposite effects on the plant and microorganism growth. These authors also indicated that the \n\nhigher the concentration of unsaturated compounds, aromatic, and acids, the more toxic the \n\nhydrocarbons are to soil microorganisms. \n \n \n \n\n3.6. Correlations. The results of the regression and correlation analyses demonstrated \n\nthat several of the investigated soil parameters correlated significantly with the residual soil \n\nhydrocarbon content in both soils S1 and S2  following contamination with 3.0% and 4.5% \n\nused lubricating oil during the 90-day period  of study (Table 5). Hydrocarbon content \n\ncorrelated strongly and negatively with soil pH, the number of hydrocarbon bacteria utilizers \n\n(P &lt;0.001), soil respiration (CO2-evolution) and percentage oil degradation (P &lt;0.01).  \n\nThere were also several significant correlations between other measured soil parameters \n\n(Table 5). The Soil pH correlated significantly and positively with hydrocarbon utilizers and \n\nsoil respiration at both level of contamination in both soils.  \n\n\n\n \n\n63 \n\n \n\nTable 5.

Correlation between CO2 evolution and oil biodegradation. The \n\nrelationships between oil biodegradation and concentration of CO2 evolved in soils \n\ncontaminated with 3 %, and 4.5 % used lubricating oil in different treatments T1, T2, \n\nT3 and T4 are shown in Figures 7 to 10. The results of oil biodegradation in soil \n\ncontaminated with used lubricating oil with 3 and 4.5 % in amended soil with \n\nhydrocarbon degrading bacterial consortium products, soil amended with nutrients and \n\nunamended soil show strong positive linear correlation with CO2 evolution, while that of \n\ncontrol, where most of the available microorganisms have been killed with sodium \n\nazide, shows weak correlation in soil 1 (S1) at both level of pollution 3.0 and 4.5 %. \n\nPolluted soil without any amendments (T3) shows better correlation (r = 0.97 and 0.99) \n\nin both soils S1 and S2, respectively, than those amended with microbial consortium \n\ncommercial products (Amnite p1300) and nutrient amended soil (T2) at 3.0% oil \n\npollution. This might be due to unavailability of the organic compounds to the bacteria \n\ncommunity as a result of the biodegradation that occurred in the amended soils. \n\nCommercial microbial consortium amended soil shows strong correlation of (0.96, 0.98) \n\nat 3 % and (0.98, 0.88) at 4.5 % in soils 1 and 2 respectively. This might be due to the \n\nability of the microbial consortium products to degrade heavy hydrocarbons effectively. \n\nNutrients amended soils (T2) also had a strong correlation of (0.90, 0.98) at 3 % and \n\n(0.98, 0.95) at 4.5 % in soils 1 and 2 respectively. Nutrients availability to the \n\nindigenous bacteria might contribute to their population increase and thereby increase \n\ndegradation of the organic compound. The positive linear correlation between CO2 \n\nevolution and oil biodegradation recorded in most of the treatments can be attributed to \n\nthe increase in microbial activities in all the treatments which implies that most of the \n\noil breakdown in the contaminated soil can be attributed to microbial degradation due to \n\nappreciable release of CO2 during the process of oil breakdown. These results agrees \n\nwith the findings of several authors (Ijah and Antai, 2003b; Roling et al., 2004 and \n\nMorais and Tornisielo 2009), who reported positive linear correlation of oil \n\nbiodegradation with high CO2 evolution in oil contaminated.  \n\n\n\n \n\n65 \n\n \n\n 3.7. Biodegradation of hydrocarbon fractions. Biodegradation of hydrocarbon \nfractions present in the used lubricating oil was determined at fifteen days interval for \n90 days using GC/FID. The hydrocarbon fractions were divided into three fractions \nwhich are: C10 \u2013 C14, C15 \u2013 C28 and C29 \u2013 C36 (Alberdi et al., 2001). \n\n \n\n3.7.1 Biodegradation of C10 \u2013 C14 fractions in used lubricating oil. Oil-contaminated \n\nsoil with 3 % amended with commercial bacterial consortium (Amnite P1300) and \n\nNutrients (NH4)2SO4 and K2HPO4 recorded complete biodegradation of C10 \u2013 C14 \n\nhydrocarbon fractions below the detection limit within ninety days in the clayey soil \n\n(S1) compared to unamended and the control soil. In the sandy soil (S2) however, only \n\nthe treatment with Amnite P1300 recorded complete degradation below the detection \n\nlimit. There was no complete degradation of the fractions (C10 \u2013 C14) in nutrients \n\namended, unamended and sterile contaminated soils throughout the ninety days \n\nperiods. Soil contaminated with 4.5% used lubricating oil did not record any oil \n\nbiodegradation below detection limit in all the treatments within the ninety days of the \n\nexperiment, but there were appreciable degradation in the soils contaminated with the \n\nused lubricating oil amended with Amnite P1300, followed by nutrient amendment \n\nand unamended soils, the control soil had the least biodegradation throughout the 90 \n\ndays period (fig. 5). The sterile polluted soils at 90 days has residual C10 \u2013 C14 fractions \n\nof 437.43 and 747.00 mg/kg in clayey soil at 3.0 and 4.5 % level of pollution, and 464 \n\nand 817 mg/kg in sandy soil at 3 and 4.5 % level of pollution. The rapid \n\nbiodegradation of C10 \u2013 C14 fractions has been reported to be among the most rapidly \n\nbiodegraded components of oil, although they are also susceptible to removal by \n\nextensive water washing. Empirically, the first sign of biodegradation are usually n-\n\nalkane in the C10 to C13 range, which probably reflects an optimal carbon number with \n\nincreasing enthalpy of reaction and decreasing water solubility as the alkane carbon \n\nnumber increases (Palmer, 1993; Masterson, et al., 2001). The results, like those of C10 \n\n\u2013 C14 contaminated at 3.0 % revealed the effectiveness of Amnite P1300 to effect \n\ncomplete degradation of C10 \u2013 C14 fractions in this level of contamination in both soils. \n\n\n\n \n\n66 \n\n \n\n   \n\n  \n\nFig.5: Concentration (mg/kg) of aliphatic hydrocarbon fractions (C10 \u2013 C14) in different soil types (S1) and (S2) contaminated with 3.0 %   \nand 4.5 % used lubricating oil.\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\n1600\n\nC 1\n0 \n\n-C\n14\n\n(m\ng/\n\nkg\n)\n\nClayey + 3.0 % SOIL+OIL+P1300SOIL+OIL+NPK\nSOIL+OIL\nSOIL+OIL+NaN3\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\n1600\n\nC 1\n0\n\n-C\n14\n\n(m\ng/\n\nkg\n)\n\nClayey+ 4.5% oil\nSOIL+OIL+P1300\nSOIL+OIL+NPK\nSOIL+OIL\nSOIL+OIL+NaN3\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\n1600\n\n0 15 30 45 60 75 90\n\nC 1\n0 \n\n-C\n14\n\n(m\ng/\n\nkg\n)\n\nTime (days)\n\nClay Loamy Sand + 3.0 % oil\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\n1600\n\n0 15 30 45 60 75 90\nC 1\n\n0\n-C\n\n14\n(m\n\ng/\nkg\n\n)\nTime (days)\n\nClay Loamy Sand + 4.5 % oil\n\n\n\n \n\n67 \n\n \n\nThis still pointed out its ability to degrade the short chain hydrocarbons fractions better \n\nthan other treatments applied during the 90 days of the experimental period. The results \n\nis similar to that of Chang et al., (2010) who reported a substantial degradation of C10-\n\nC16 hydrocarbon fraction in aged petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated soil. \n\n \n\n3.7.2 Biodegradation of C15 \u2013 C28 fractions in used lubricating oil.  The results show \n\nthat the hydrocarbon fractions C15 \u2013 C28 were not degraded below the detection limit in \n\nall the treatments within the experimental periods, however the degree of \n\nbiodegradation varies greatly based on the percentage of oil pollution and the \n\namendments. The reason for incomplete biodegradation of these hydrocarbon fractions \n\nbelow detection limit might be due to their complex structure, which always posed \n\nsome significant difficulty to hydrocarbon utilizing bacteria in their complete \n\nbiodegradation (Peters and Moldowan, 1993). In soil contaminated with 3.0 % oil in \n\nboth soils, Amnite P1300 amended soil recorded highest biodegradation of C15 \u2013 C28 \n\nhydrocarbon fractions from the initial concentration of (16245 and 16348 mg/kg) to \n\n(3154 and 3658 mg/kg) in clayey and sandy soil respectively after 90 days of the \n\nexperimental study. Studies with soil contaminated with 4.5 % oil pollution also \n\nrevealed that Amnite1300 amended soil has the best treatment where the oil fractions \n\nwere reduced from the initial concentration of (22954 and 23254 mg/kg) to (9448 and \n\n10748 mg/kg) in clayey and sandy soil respectively after 90 days of the experimental \n\nstudy (fig. 6). The unamended contaminated and control soils recorded very low \n\nbiodegradation of the C15 \u2013 C28 fractions throughout the 90 days period in both soils at \n\ndifferent level of contamination with used lubricating oil. The increase in the \n\nbiodegradation of C15 \u2013 C28 fractions in soil amended with Amnite P1300 might be due \n\nto the ability of the bacterial products conditioned to degrade heavy hydrocarbons. \n\n\n\n \n\n68 \n\n \n\n    \n\n    \n\nFig.6: Concentration (mg/kg) of aliphatic hydrocarbon fractions (C15 \u2013 C28) in different soil types (S1) and (S2) contaminated with   3.0 \n% and 4.5 % used lubricating oil. \n\n0\n\n5000\n\n10000\n\n15000\n\n20000\n\n25000\nC 1\n\n5\n-C\n\n28\n(m\n\ng/\nkg\n\n)\n\nClayey + 3.0 % oil SOIL+OIL+P1300\nSOIL+OIL+NPK\nSOIL+OIL\nSOIL+OIL+NaN3\n\n0\n\n5000\n\n10000\n\n15000\n\n20000\n\n25000\n\nC 1\n5 \n\n-C\n28\n\n(m\ng/\n\nkg\n)\n\nClayey + 4.5 % oil SOIL+OIL+P1300SOIL+OIL+NPK\nSOIL+OIL\nSOIL+OIL+NaN3\n\n0\n\n5000\n\n10000\n\n15000\n\n20000\n\n25000\n\n0 15 30 45 60 75 90\n\nC 1\n5\n\n-C\n28\n\n(m\ng/\n\nkg\n)\n\nTime (days)\n\nClay Loamy Sand + 3.0% oil \n\n0\n\n5000\n\n10000\n\n15000\n\n20000\n\n25000\n\n0 15 30 45 60 75 90\nC 1\n\n5\n-C\n\n28\n(m\n\ng/\nkg\n\n)\nTime (days)\n\nClay Loamy Sand + 4.5% oil\n\n\n\n \n\n69 \n\n \n\n \n3.7.3 Biodegradation of C29 \u2013 C36 fractions in used lubricating oil. The results of the \n\nstudy revealed that these fractions of petroleum hydrocarbons were not properly degraded \n\nin all the treatments. The incomplete degradation of these hydrocarbon fractions has been \n\nreported by different authors that they are not easily degraded by microorganisms in the \n\nsoil because they are hydrophobic solids at physiological temperature (Alberdi et al., \n\n2001; George et al., 2002). In soil contaminated with 3 % used lubricating oil, soil \n\namended with Amnite P1300 recorded reduction in C29 \u2013 C36 in the concentration from \n\n9441 and 9684 mg/kg to 4566 and 3981 mg/kg in clayey and sandy soil, respectively, \n\nafter 90 days of the experimental study, whereas in the control contaminated soil, the \n\nbiodegradation of the hydrocarbon fractions was minimal (reduction from 9321 and 9743 \n\nmg/kg to 8816 and 9291 mg/kg in clayey and sandy soil, respectively, after 90 days of the \n\nexperimental study (fig.7). The same pattern were also recorded in the 4.5 % \n\ncontaminated level with the highest reduction recorded in the Aminte P1300 amended \n\nsoil, though lower compare with the degradation recorded in the 3.0 % contaminated \n\nlevel in the hydrocarbon fractions C29 \u2013 C36. The reason for low biodegradation of these \n\nhydrocarbon fractions might also be attributed to the fact that during biodegradation of \n\nhydrocarbons in soil or sediments, low molecular weight fractions are known to be \n\ndegraded first by microorganisms before degrading the higher molecular weight \n\npetroleum fractions (Coulon et al., 2004; Sanscartier et al., 2009). Therefore, in this study \n\npossibly the low molecular weight fractions were first degraded by indigenous \n\nmicroorganisms before the higher molecular weight, thus, accounting for the low \n\nbiodegradation of the higher molecular fractions in the range of C29 to C36. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n70 \n\n \n\n    \n\n    \n\nFig. 7: Concentration (mg/kg) of aliphatic hydrocarbon fractions (C29 \u2013 C36) in different soil types (S1) and (S2) contaminated with    \n3.0 % and 4.5 % used lubricating oil. \n\n0\n\n3000\n\n6000\n\n9000\n\n12000\n\n15000\n\n18000\nC 2\n\n9\n-C\n\n36\n(m\n\ng/\nkg\n\n)\n\nS1 + 3.0% oil SOIL+OIL+P1300SOIL+OIL+NPK\nSOIL+OIL\nSOIL+OIL+NaN3\n\n0\n\n3000\n\n6000\n\n9000\n\n12000\n\n15000\n\n18000\n\nC 2\n6 \n\n-C\n36\n\n(m\ng/\n\nkg\n)\n\nS1 + 4.5% oil SOIL+OIL+P1300SOIL+OIL+NPK\nSOIL+OIL\nSOIL+OIL+NaN3\n\n0\n\n3000\n\n6000\n\n9000\n\n12000\n\n15000\n\n18000\n\n0 15 30 45 60 75 90\n\nC 2\n9\n\n-C\n36\n\n(m\ng/\n\nkg\n)\n\nTime (days)\n\nS2 + 3.0% oil\n\n0\n\n3000\n\n6000\n\n9000\n\n12000\n\n15000\n\n18000\n\n0 15 30 45 60 75 90\nC 2\n\n9\n-C\n\n36\n(m\n\ng/\nkg\n\n)\nTime (days)\n\nS2 + 4.5% oil\n\n\n\n \n\n71 \n\n \n\n3.8. Biodegradation of PAHs in used lubricating oil. The results from this study \n\ndemonstrate degradation of eight PAHs present in the used lubricating oils during the \n\nbiodegradation studies, using a microbial consortium present in Amnite P1300 as an \n\namendment, addition of nutrients, unmended and the control soil with sodium azide to \n\ndegrade soils contaminated with used lubricating oil. These PAHs have been identified by US \n\nEnvironmental protection Agency (EPA) as priority pollutants.  Figure (8 to 11) show the \n\nresults (concentration in mg/kg) of different residual PAHs present in the used lubricating oil \n\nin each treatment during the bioremediation studies. Pruell and Quinn (1988) detected sixteen \n\nPAHs with 2- to 6-rings in used lubricating oils. In other similar studies, twenty-five PAHs \n\nwith 2- to 6-rings were recorded by \u00d6stman and Colmsj\u00f6 (1989), and as many as eighty-four \n\nwere reported by Grimmer et al. (1981) and Paschke et al. (1992). The following eight PAHs \n\nwith 2- to 4-rings (Naphtalene (Nap), Acenaphthylene (Can), Acenaphthene (Anth), Fluorene \n\n(Flu), Phenanthrene (Phr), Anthracene (Ant), Fluoranthene (Flt ) and Pyrene (Pyr) were the \n\nmain PAHs detected in our studies during the bioremediation experiment in soils \n\ncontaminated with used lubricating oil. These contrasting results demonstrated the difficulty \n\nof detecting individual PAHs in used lubricating oils whose matrices become complex after \n\nhigh temperature combustion. \n\nThe quantity and the composition of PAHs in the laboratory incubations were \n\ndetermined at the start of the experiment, and every 30 days thereafter till the end of the  \n\nincubation. After 90 days of incubation, Naphthalene, Acenaphthylene and Acenaphthene \n\nwere depleted in all the treatments and the abiotic control samples in both soils and \n\ncontamination levels below the detection limit of 0.5 mg/kg, indicating abiotic removal, \n\nprobably due to volatilization. It has been observed that PAHs resistance to oxidation, \n\nreduction, and vapourization increases with increasing molecular weight, whereas the aqueous \n\nsolubility of these compounds decreases (Taylor and Jones, 2000). The results of \n\nbiodegradation of different PAHs of higher molecular weights within the period of the study \n\nrevealed the degradation of fluorene below the detection limit of 0.5 mg/kg in Amnite P1300 \n\n(T1), Nutrients amended (T2) and unamended (T3), in both soils and contamination levels, \n\nwhereas, limited degradation were recorded in the control soils (T4) in both contamination \n\nlevels within the period of the experiment. Complete degradation of phenanthrene and \n\n\n\n \n\n72 \n\n \n\nanthracene was only achieved in T1 and T2, while the two PAHs were not completely \n\ndegraded in T3 and T4 in both soils and contamination levels.  \n\nComplete degradation of fluoranthene and pyrene below the detection limit was also \n\nrevealed in T1, the effect of the addition of the nutrients was negligible in the degradation of \n\nthese two PAHs. However, it was clear that two \u2013 to four-ring aromatic compounds in the \n\nused lubricating oil had been substantially degraded in Amnite P1300 amended soils at both \n\ncontamination levels, while other treatments did not record complete degradation of \n\nfluoranthene and pyrene after 90 days of the experimental study. The reason for complete \n\ndegradation of PAHs recorded in soil amended with Amnite P1300 might be due to the soil \n\ntexture improvement from possible increased in oxygen transfer as a result of the increase in \n\nthe bacterial consortium present in the contaminated soil. Singh and Lin (2008) asserted that \n\nindividual microorganisms can metabolize only a limited range of hydrocarbon substrates, so \n\nassemblages of mixed populations with overall broad enzymatic capacities are required to \n\nincrease the rate and extent of PAHs biodegradation. Also, loss of PAHs recorded in the \n\nsterile polluted soil might be due to different processes such as volatilization, adsorption, \n\nphotolysis or chemical degradation which are known to contribute to PAHs degradation in \n\ncontaminated soil (Haritash and Kaushik, 2009). \n\nhttp://scialert.net/fulltext/?doi=jest.2012.74.83&amp;org=11#789873_ja?\n\n\n \n\n73 \n\n \n\n   \n\n    \n\nFig.8: Concentration (mg/kg) of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Soil 1 (S1) contaminated with 3.0 % used lubricating oil. \nPAHs present are: Nap - Naphtalene ; Can \u2013 Acenaphthylene; Anth \u2013 Acenaphthene; Flu \u2013 Fluorene; Phr \u2013 Phenanthrene; Ant \u2013 \nAnthracene;  Flt - Fluoranthene and Pyr \u2013 Pyrene. \n\n \n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n\nRe\nsi\n\ndu\nal\n\nPA\nH\n\ns \n (m\n\ng/\nkg\n\n)\nT1\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n\nRe\nsi\n\ndu\nal\n\n P\nA\n\nH\ns \n\n (m\ng/\n\nkg\n)\n\nT2\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nNap Can Anth Flu Phr Ant Flt Pyr\n\nRe\nsi\n\ndu\nal\n\nPA\nH\n\ns \n (m\n\ng/\nkg\n\n)\n\nT3\n\n0 30 60 90 (days)\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n\nNap Can Anth Flu Phr Ant Flt Pyr\n\nRe\nsi\n\ndu\nal\n\nPA\nH\n\ns \n(m\n\ng/\nkg\n\n)\n\nT4\n\n0 30 60 90 (days)\n\n\n\n \n\n74 \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\n       \n\nFig.9: Concentration (mg/kg) of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Soil 1 (S1) contaminated with 4.5 % used lubricating oil. \nPAHs present are: Nap - Naphtalene ; Can \u2013 Acenaphthylene; Anth \u2013 Acenaphthene; Flu \u2013 Fluorene; Phr \u2013 Phenanthrene; Ant \u2013 \nAnthracene;   Flt  - Fluoranthene and Pyr \u2013 Pyrene. \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\nRe\n\nsi\ndu\n\nal\nPA\n\nH\ns \n\n (m\ng/\n\nkg\n)\n\nT1\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n\nRe\nsi\n\ndu\nal\n\n P\nA\n\nH\ns \n\n(m\ng/\n\nkg\n)\n\nT2\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nNap Can Anth Flu Phr Ant Flt Pyr\n\nRe\nsi\n\ndu\nal\n\n P\nA\n\nH\ns \n\n (m\ng/\n\nkg\n)\n\nT3\n\n0 30 60 90 (days)\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n\nNap Can Anth Flu Phr Ant Flt Pyr\nRe\n\nsi\ndu\n\nal\n P\n\nA\nH\n\ns \n (m\n\ng/\nkg\n\n)\n\nT4\n\n0 30 60 90 (days)\n\n\n\n \n\n75 \n\n \n\n    \n\n                    \n\nFig.10: Concentration (mg/kg) of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Soil2 (S2) contaminated with 3.0 % used lubricating oil. \nPAHs present are: Nap - Naphtalene ; Can \u2013 Acenaphthylene; Anth \u2013 Acenaphthene; Flu \u2013 Fluorene; Phr \u2013 Phenanthrene; Ant \u2013 \nAnthracene;    Flt- Fluoranthene and Pyr \u2013 Pyrene. \n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n\nRe\nsi\n\ndu\nal\n\n P\nA\n\nH\ns \n\n (m\ng/\n\nkg\n)\n\nT1\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n\nRe\nsi\n\ndu\nal\n\n P\nA\n\nH\ns \n\n(m\ng/\n\nkg\n)\n\nT2\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n\nNap Can Anth Flu Phr Ant Flt Pyr\n\nRe\nsi\n\ndu\nal\n\nPA\nH\n\ns \n(m\n\ng/\nkg\n\n)\n\nT3\n\n0 30 60 90 (days)\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n\nNap Can Anth Flu Phr Ant Flt Pyr\nRe\n\nsi\ndu\n\nal\n P\n\nA\nH\n\ns \n(m\n\ng/\nkg\n\n)\n\nT4\n\n0 30 60 90 (days)\n\n\n\n \n\n76 \n\n \n\n    \n\n    \n\nFig.11: Concentration (mg/kg) of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Soil 2 (S2) contaminated with 4.5 % used lubricating oil. \nPAHs present are: Nap - Naphtalene ; Can \u2013 Acenaphthylene; Anth \u2013 Acenaphthene; Flu \u2013 Fluorene; Phr \u2013 Phenanthrene; Ant \u2013 \nAnthracene;    Flt- Fluoranthene and Pyr \u2013 Pyrene. \n\n \n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n\nRe\nsi\n\ndu\nal\n\n P\nA\n\nH\ns \n\n(m\ng/\n\nkg\n)\n\nT1\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n\nRe\nsi\n\ndu\nal\n\n P\nA\n\nH\ns \n\n(m\ng/\n\nkg\n)\n\nT2\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n\nNap Can Anth Flu Phr Ant Flt Pyr\n\nRe\nsi\n\ndu\nal\n\n P\nA\n\nH\ns \n\n(m\ng/\n\nkg\n)\n\nT3\n\n0 30 60 90 (days)\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n\nNap Can Anth Flu Phr Ant Flt Pyr\n\nRe\nsi\n\ndu\nal\n\n P\nA\n\nH\ns \n\n(m\ng/\n\nkg\n)\n\nT4\n\n0 30 60 90 (days)\n\n\n\n \n\n77 \n\n \n\n4.  CONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\nThe present study clearly showed efficiency of mixed microbial consortium in the \n\ndegradation of used lubricating oil components. Hence we suggest the use of the mixed \n\nmicrobial consortium for bioremediation of used lubricating oil contaminated sites.  \n\nThe toxic effect of used lubricating oil is more pronounced in sandy soil than \n\nclayey soil. The influence of the soil characteristics on the toxic effects of hydrocarbons \n\nhas also been revealed in this study, soils with a higher organic matter and clay content \n\nbeing less affected by this kind of contamination.  \n\nHydrocarbons degrading bacteria (HDB) counts were higher in clayey soil, at \n\nhighest population of (2.8 x 108 CFU/g) at day 60, in 3.0% contamination level, though the \n\npopulation reduces as the contamination level increases. This study has also shown that \n\nsoil microbiological parameters may be useful tools for assessing the effect of \n\nhydrocarbon contamination on soil wellbeing. \n\nThe contaminants at the two loading rates (3 and 4.5%) assayed, increased soil \n\nrespiration in both soils, especially in the clayey soil. The used lubricating oil contaminated \n\nclayey soils showed that respiration in 3.0 % loading rates producing the greatest CO2 \n\nemissions. The higher amount of CO2 liberated in clayey soil amended with amnite products \n\nand contaminated with 3 % and 4.5 % used lubricating oil is an indication of high utilization \n\nof organic carbon nutrients from the petroleum hydrocarbons present in this sample.  \n\nThe bioaugmentation approach (Amnite P1300) gave the best result in this study as \n\nthe concentration of the hydrocarbon contaminated soil increases and this can be used to \n\ndevelop a safe and economical full-scale treatment technology for soils contaminated with \n\nused lubricating oil. However, laboratory studies can produce overly optimistic results under \n\ncontrolled conditions, making it difficult to predict the performance of bioremediation \n\nstrategies in the field where there is less control of environmental parameters and increased \n\nsoil heterogeneity. An upgrade to field scale trials is therefore warranted to corroborate with \n\nthe conclusions drawn from this study prior to undertaking field scale ventures. Also, the \n\ntypes of soil and hydrocarbon concentrations may determine the rate and extent of \n\nhydrocarbon remediation.  \n\n\n\n \n\n78 \n\n \n\n5. REFERENCES \n\nAbdulsalam,  S. Bugaje, I.

The biodegradation rate of used lubricating \n\noil in clayey contaminated soil is therefore evident. Though, the biodegradation rate reduces \n\nas the concentration of the pollution increases, but this clearly points out that, clayey soil \n\ncontaminated with used lubricating oil degraded faster than sandy soil when amended with \n\nmicrobial consortium.  \n\nThe correlations between the parameters investigated and the levels of the \n\nhydrocarbon residues were determined. The residual hydrocarbon content correlated \n\nnegatively with percentage of hydrocarbon degradation, hydrocarbon utilizers, CO2 evolution \n\nand pH in all the soil types, and the levels of pollution.  \n\nThe influence of the soil characteristics on the toxic effects of hydrocarbons has also \n\nbeen revealed in this study, soils with a higher organic matter and clay content being less \n\naffected by this kind of contamination. Thus, inhibitory effect of used lubricating oil is more \n\npronounced in sandy soil than in clayey soil and show more toxic effect on seed germination \n\nand root growth. The results of this study therefore, indicate that Amnite P1300 is an \n\nefficacious product facilitating the biodegradation and elimination of hydrocarbon compounds \n\nfrom used lubrication oil contamination in different soil types, but there is a recalcitrant \n\nfraction of the hydrocarbons that remain in soil after the evaluated time period. The shorter \n\nchain aliphatic hydrocarbons are more degraded than the longer chain aliphatic hydrocarbons \n\nin both soils. \n\n\n\n \n\n85 \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n \n \nABNT - Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Normas T\u00e9cnicas (1987).
