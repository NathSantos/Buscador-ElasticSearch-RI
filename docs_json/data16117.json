I had to be persistent to dedicate in order to consolidate my studies with work, but \n\nalso patient to adapt myself to the university environment after years away of the academic scene. \n\nBut looking back at the last four and a half years, this process has allowed me to grow and learn a \n\nlot. Furthermore, I met several special and valuable people, that I\u2019m sure will succeed in their \n\nprofessional and personal lives. \n\nI would like to thank every person that directly or indirectly helped me during this process. \n\nFirst of all, I thank Prof. Dr. Antonio Carlos Bannwart for giving me the opportunity to \n\nlearn and work with him and for giving me space to develop this work with a lot of autonomy. I \n\nthank him for trusting and respecting me as a professional. \n\nI thank Dr. Jorge Luiz Biazussi for all of his dedication, for showing me his work and \n\nhelping me with the development of my own thesis. I also thank him for his care in always \n\nanswering my questions promptly. \n\nI thank Prof. Dr. Ricardo Augusto Mazza, Prof. Dr. Jorge Luis Bali\u00f1o and Prof. Dr. \n\nMarcelo Souza de Castro for their valuable contributions and suggestions during the review \n\nprocess. \n\nI also thank S\u00e9rgio Loeser for revising my work analyzing it from the industry perspective. \n\nI thank Michelle Fulaneto, F\u00e1tima Lima, Alice Kiyoka, Diogo Furlan and Vanessa Kojima \n\nfor helping me with all the materials and logistics. Without them it would be impossible to \n\nconciliate studies and work.  \n\nI thank my husband Christian for reviewing my work several times and for his patience and \n\nincentive. \n\nI thank my mother Sandra, father Alexandre and brother Lucas also for their patience and \n\nincentive. \n\n \n  \n\n\n\nx \n \n\n\n\nxi \n \n\n  \n\n\u201cEverything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler\u201d \n\nAlbert Einstein \n\n\n\nxii \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nxiii \n \n\nABSTRACT \n\nThe hydraulic performance of centrifugal pumps depends on several hydraulic dimensions \n\nof the pump, but most of them are not easily accessible. Therefore, the pump\u2019s hydraulic \n\nperformance always has to be informed by the pump manufacturer. Furthermore, in order to \n\nprotect their intellectual property, manufacturers rarely share more detailed information about the \n\npump hydraulics with the public. As a consequence, pump users and researchers don\u2019t have \n\naccess to all the data they possibly need. In literature, there are several proposed models based on \n\nfluid dynamic principles and experimental data that attempt to predict the hydraulic performance \n\nof centrifugal pumps. Alternatively, it is also possible to calculate a pump\u2019s performance with \n\nnumerical simulation. However, the accuracy of such models is usually proportional to the \n\nnumber of necessary parameters \u2013 those of which may not be easily accessible, as stated before. \n\nIn this work, a simple approach available in literature, based on fluid dynamic principles, that \n\npredicts a pump hydraulic performance with only a few accessible hydraulic dimensions, is \n\nvalidated with several experimental data. Eighty tests of different types of pumps, with a large \n\nrange of specific speeds are considered. From this analysis, correlations among the coefficients of \n\nthe model equation and the main hydraulic data of the pumps are proposed. Afterwards, several \n\nshut-off head prediction methods available in literature are analyzed in order to define the one \n\nthat best predicts the shut-off head of the given tested data. Finally, for each pump type, the best \n\ncombination of correlations and shut-off head prediction method are selected to reduce the error \n\non the whole head curve prediction. Given all the assumptions and simplifications, the objective \n\nof this work is to present a method applicable to several pump types that easily provides a \n\nprediction of the whole head curve with reasonable error. \n\n \n\nKey Word: Centrifugal Pumps, Hydraulic Performance, Experimental Validation, Head Curve \n\nPrediction, Shut-off Head Prediction \n\n  \n\n\n\nxiv \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nxv \n \n\nRESUMO \n\nA performance hidr\u00e1ulica de bombas centr\u00edfugas depende de v\u00e1rias entre suas dimens\u00f5es \n\nhidr\u00e1ulicas, mas a maioria delas n\u00e3o \u00e9 facilmente acess\u00edvel. Por este motivo, a performance \n\nhidr\u00e1ulica da bomba deve sempre ser disponibilizada pelo seu fabricante. No entanto, para \n\nproteger sua propriedade intelectual, fabricantes raramente compartilham com o p\u00fablico \n\ninforma\u00e7\u00f5es mais detalhadas sobre a hidr\u00e1ulica da bomba.

Os dados \n\nde oitenta testes de diferentes tipos de bomba, cobrindo uma ampla extens\u00e3o de velocidades \n\nespec\u00edficas, s\u00e3o considerados.

Em seguida, diversos \n\nm\u00e9todos de predi\u00e7\u00e3o da altura no shut-off dispon\u00edveis na literatura s\u00e3o analisados para que seja \n\nposs\u00edvel definir o que melhor prediz a altura no shut-off considerando os dados de teste. \n\nFinalmente, para cada tipo de bomba, a melhor combina\u00e7\u00e3o entre correla\u00e7\u00f5es e m\u00e9todo de \n\npredi\u00e7\u00e3o de altura no shut-off \u00e9 selecionada para reduzir o erro na predi\u00e7\u00e3o das curvas de altura \n\ncompletas.

They have \n\na stationary casing, which can be a volute or diffusers, with one or more impellers inside, one or \n\ntwo bearing housings and a shaft, as shown in Figure 1. The impeller mounted on the shaft is \n\ndriven via a coupling by a motor or turbine. The centrifugal force generated at the impellers is \n\ntransformed into a static pressure increase to the flow. The fluid exiting the impeller is \n\ndecelerated in the volute or diffuser in order to utilize the greatest possible part of the kinetic \n\nenergy at the impeller outlet for increasing the static pressure. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Centrifugal pump. \n\n \n\nThe flow energy is composed of kinetic energy, pressure and potential energy. In order to \n\ntransport fluid from one place to another, pumps are used to provide a static pressure increase to \n\nthe flow, which could be useful overcoming a height difference and long distances (pressure \n\nlosses in the line). \n\n\n\n2 \n \n\nAs already mentioned, the stationary part around the impeller can be a diffuser or a volute. \n\nThese are two different pump concepts, which have their applicability, advantages and \n\ndisadvantages. In both cases, the pumps can have one or multiple stages. \n\nCentrifugal pumps are widely used in the industry. Some examples of segments that use \n\ncentrifugal pumps are Oil &amp; Gas (off-shore, distribution, refineries), power, water and \n\nwastewater, pulp and paper and general industry. \n\nThe differential pressure provided by the pump (!?) is usually represented by its related \nhead of elevation (H), where \" is the fluid density and # is the acceleration due to gravity. \n\n$ = &amp;'(?                        (1) \nThis representation makes it possible to show the performance of a pump for fluids with \n\ndifferent densities in just one curve. \n\nThe pump hydraulic performance is defined by the head, shaft power, efficiency and NPSH \n\ncurves versus flow rate. In Figure 2, the performance curves of a centrifugal pump are shown. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 - Performance curves of a centrifugal pump. \n\n \n\nThese curves are associated to just one pump model and represent the pump performance \n\nwhile pumping a liquid with low viscosity (similar to the water viscosity). Furthermore, these \n\ncurves are related to just one impeller outlet diameter and rotation speed. \n\nThe range of operation of a pump defines the maximum and minimum impeller outlet \n\ndiameter and maximum and minimum flow rates for that model. \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nUsually, pumps are grouped in families. Each family represents a group of pumps with the \n\nsame design concept, but in different sizes. When all the pump ranges are put together, a wide \n\narea of operation (flow versus head) is covered, as shown in Figure 3. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Operating range. \n\n \n\nThe head and shaft power ( ? ) are measureable parameters and the efficiency ( ) ) is \ncalculated according to the Equation (2), where Q is the flow rate: \n\n) = *+('                        (2) \nThe operating point that provides the best efficiency at the maximum impeller outlet \n\ndiameter is called BEP (best efficiency point). This is the operating condition for which the \n\nhydraulics have been developed. \n\nThe specific speed is a characteristic number that represents the hydraulics and it is \n\ncalculated based on the conditions of the BEP, according to the Equation (3), where - is the \nrotational speed: \n\n./ = 01*+2 3?                       (3) \nThe hydraulic performance depends on several hydraulic dimensions of the pump. The \n\nmain ones are listed below and presented in Figure 4: \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nImpeller: \t5, 65, ?5, \t7 and \t8 \nDiffuser/volute: 9:, 6:, \t:, 9; and 6; \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Main pump hydraulic dimensions. \n\n \n\nUsually the dimensions identified by the subscript \u201c1\u201d are related to the impeller leading \n\nedge, \u201c2\u201d to the impeller trailing edge, \u201c3\u201d to the diffuser or volute leading edge and \u201c4\u201d to the \n\ndiffuser or volute trailing edge. The subscript \u201c8\u201d also indicates important dimensions in the \n\nvolute throat. \n\n \n\n1.1 Motivation \n\nDuring the conception phase of a project, it may be necessary to estimate the performance \n\nof some of the equipment in order to assess the project cost and its viability. However, most \n\npump hydraulic dimensions are not easily accessible. As a result, the pump hydraulic \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nperformance always has to be informed by the pump manufacturer, who has designed the pump \n\nhydraulics. \n\nFurthermore, in order to protect their intellectual property, manufacturers rarely share more \n\ndetailed information about the pump hydraulics with the public. As a consequence, pump users \n\nand researchers don\u2019t have access to all the data they possibly need. \n\nIn literature, there are several proposed models based on fluid dynamic principles and \n\nexperimental data that attempt to predict the hydraulic performance of centrifugal pumps. \n\nAlternatively, it is also possible to calculate a pump\u2019s performance with numerical simulation. \n\nHowever, the accuracy of such models is usually proportional to the number of necessary \n\nparameters \u2013 those of which may not be easily accessible, as stated before. \n\nBased on this scenario, it would be very useful to predict a pump\u2019s hydraulic performance \n\nwith only a few accessible hydraulic dimensions, so that the dependency on the manufacturer\u2019s \n\ninformation would be reduced. Furthermore anyone would be able to predict the hydraulic \n\nperformance of a pump with acceptable accuracy. \n\n \n\n1.2 Objectives \n\nBiazussi (2014) presented a simple single-phase approach (model), based on fluid dynamic \n\nprinciples, that defines the head versus flow rate curve. It is presented in Chapter 3. According to \n\nthis approach, for fluids with low viscosity, the head curve is a quadratic function of the flow \n\nrate, as expected. Some assumptions and simplifications were considered, so that the model \n\nwould only depend on a few accessible hydraulic dimensions and the performance would be \n\npredicted with reasonable error. \n\nOne of the equation coefficients, ?7, is defined by accessible hydraulic dimensions of the \npump. The other coefficients are adjusted by the model in order to reproduce the given tested \n\ndata. Some tests were held in order to validate this model and also propose correlations among \n\nthese coefficients and basic hydraulic data of the pumps.  \n\nThe results of the work were presented and were considered reliable for these few cases \n\nstudied. However more experimental data was necessary to fully validate the model.  \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nThe current work uses Biazussi (2014)\u2019s work as a starting point. The data from eighty tests \n\nwas collected so that the aforementioned model could be validated and that its coverage could be \n\ndefined. Several different types of centrifugal pumps with a large range of specific speeds were \n\nconsidered and are described in Chapter 4. \n\nIn Chapter 5, the tested hydraulic performances were compared to the results provided by \n\nthe model. Furthermore, the mentioned equation coefficients were plotted against the pump \n\nspecific speed in order to analyze if there was a correlation among them. It was possible to find \n\nclear tendencies, even considering all the different types of pumps. \n\nConsidering these tendencies, equations were proposed in order to make it possible to \n\ndefine the head curve against flow based only on the specific speed and main hydraulic \n\ndimensions of the pump, such as \t5, 65, ?5 and \t7. The correlation based curves were compared \nto the tested curves and the difference between them was analyzed. \n\nAfterwards, since an offset of the prediction of the head curve was observed in some cases, \n\nseveral shut-off head prediction methods available in literature were analyzed in order to define \n\nthe one that best predicts the shut-off head of the given tested data.  \n\nFinally, for each pump type, the best combination of correlations and shut-off head \n\nprediction method was selected to reduce the error on the whole head curve prediction. \n\nGiven all the assumptions and simplifications, the objective of the current work is to \n\npresent correlations applicable to several pump types that easily provides a prediction of the \n\npump head curve with reasonable error. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n2 LITERATURE REVIEW \n\n2.1 Dimensional analysis  \n\nDimensional analysis is used to represent all the parameters in a dimensionless way, so that \n\nit is possible to compare different scenarios. With regard to the pump performance, using \n\ndimensional analysis it is possible to compare performances considering different speeds or \n\nimpeller outlet diameter, for instance. G\u00fclich (2007) presents a detailed explanation of the \n\ndimensional analysis.  \n\nThe independent variables related to the pump performance are differential pressure (??) \nand shaft power (? ). These variables depend on the flow rate (Q), speed (-), impeller outlet \ndiameter (\t5), roughness (=), viscosity (>) and density (\"). Therefore: \n\n!? = ?7@A, \t5, -, \", >, =C          ? = ?5@A, \t5, -, \", >, =C                (4) \nBased on the dimensional analysis, the following dimensionless coefficients are defined: \n\nFlow coefficient: D* = *0??2                   (5) \nHead coefficient: D+ = &amp;'(0???? ; D+ = ?:ED* , F, =/\t5G               (6) \nPower coefficient: D' = H (02??I ; D' = ?JED* , F, =/\t5G               (7) \nwhere X = 7K?L =\n\nM\n(0??? .                      (8) \n\nThe parameter =/\t5  is the relative roughness, which affects the pump efficiency. The \nefficiency ) is related to these dimensionless coefficients in the following way: \n\n) = (*&amp;'H =\n????\n\n?N = ?OED* , F, =/\t5G                   (9) \nThe dimensionless specific speed is represented as: \n\nP? = 1????2 3?                     (10) \n \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\n2.2 One-dimensional calculation with velocity triangles \n\nThe velocity of the fluid within the diffuser and the impeller can be understood with the \n\nhelp of the velocity triangle, which breaks down the fluid\u2019s main velocity components in certain \n\npositions, as shown in Figure 5.  \n\nIn this analysis, some considerations need to be made: \n\n\u2022 The flow is permanent and one-dimensional; \n\n\u2022 The flow is uniform through the impeller; \n\n\u2022 Secondary flow is disregarded. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Impeller inlet and outlet velocity triangles (Biazussi, 2014). \n\n \n\nSimilar to the hydraulic dimensions, the parameters related to the impeller leading edge are \n\nidentified by the subscript \u201c1\u201d and the ones related to the impeller trailing edge by the subscript \n\n\u201c2\u201d. \n\nThe flow velocity is defined by two components. The first one is the velocity tangent to the \n\nimpeller vane w. The second one is the peripheral velocity, ? = -Q. Then the absolute flow \nvelocity V is the vector sum of these two components. \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nRST = USST + ?ST                    (11) \nBy balancing the moment of inertia, while admitting permanent flow and disregarding the \n\neffect of gravity, the power that the impeller exerts on the fluid can be formulated as:   \n\n? = \"A@-Q5R?5 ? -Q7R?7C                   (12) \nGiven that ?? = X? - , the torque (X? ) can be written as: \nX? = \"A@Q5R?5 ? Q7R?7C                  (13) \nIn an ideal system where no losses are considered, ?? = \"#A$. Thus, the ideal differential \n\npressure provided by the impeller is represented by: \n\n!?\n = \"@?5R?5 ? ?7R?7C                  (14) \nThe equation above is called the Euler equation for turbo machines. It can be seen that the \n\npower, torque and differential head depend only on the peripheral velocities and the tangential \n\ncomponent of the absolute velocities on the impeller inlet and outlet.  \n\nIf we consider that the flow has no tangential velocity on entering the impeller (R?7 = 0), \nand apply some geometric correlations based on the triangle velocities, the Euler equation can be \n\nwritten as: \n\n!?\n = \"?55 Z1 ? * ??? [?5\\??]???^                              (15) \nwhere, according to Figure 5, ?5 is the outlet angle of the impeller vane and 65 is the width \n\nof the impeller outlet. \n\n \n\n2.3 Pressure losses \n\nAccording to G\u00fclich (2007), losses arise whenever a fluid flows through (or components \n\nmove in) a machine. The useful power is therefore always smaller than the power supplied at the \n\npump shaft, where the losses are dissipated into heat. The sources of loss are classified in the \n\nfollowing groups: \n\n\u2022 Mechanical losses in bearings and shaft seals. Since these losses don\u2019t cause fluid \n\nheat, they are considered external losses; \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\n\u2022 Volumetric losses due to all leakages which are pumped by the impeller, including \n\nleakage through the annular seals, device for axial thrust balancing, balance holes \n\nand central balance devices; \n\n\u2022 Disk friction losses generated on rear and front shrouds of the impellers which \n\nrotate in the fluid; \n\n\u2022 Similar friction losses created by the components of axial thrust balance devices; \n\n\u2022 Leakage through the interstage seals in multistage pumps. These leakages do not \n\nflow through the impeller. Consequently, they do not influence the power \n\ntransferred from the impeller vanes to the fluid; \n\n\u2022 Hydraulic losses due to friction and vortex dissipation in all components between \n\nsuction and discharge nozzle; \n\n\u2022 Fluid recirculation at partload creates high losses due to an exchange of momentum \n\nbetween stalled and non-separated fluid zones. \n\n \n\nThe real head curve can be obtained by subtracting the hydraulic losses caused by friction \n\nand vortex dissipation from the theoretical head. \n\n \n\n2.3.1 Friction losses \n\nThe shear stresses created by the velocity gradient in the non-separated boundary layers are \n\nresponsible for the friction losses. According to G\u00fclich (2007), experience shows that roughness \n\nincreases the flow resistance in turbulent flow. However, this is only the case if the roughness \n\nelements protrude beyond the laminar sub-layer. In laminar flow the roughness has no influence \n\non the resistance since there is no exchange of momentum across the flow. With growing \n\nReynolds number, the boundary layer thickness decreases and the permissible roughness drops as \n\nwell. Vortex shedding from the roughness peaks creates energy dissipation due to the exchange \n\nof momentum with the main flow. In the fully rough domain the losses become independent of \n\nthe Reynolds number and increase with the square of the flow velocity. \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\n2.3.2 Vortex dissipation (form drag) \n\nIn this work, all of the following were considered as vortex dissipation losses: localized \n\nlosses, shock losses, losses due to secondary flow and recirculation. Since recirculation causes \n\nvortex dissipation, the losses due to this effect will be also considered as hydraulic losses. \n\nWhile static pressure can be converted into kinetic energy without a major loss (accelerated \n\nflow), the reverse process of converting kinetic energy into static pressure involves far greater \n\nlosses, because the velocity distributions are actually mostly non-uniform and subject to further \n\ndistortion upon deceleration. Non-uniform flow generates losses caused by turbulent dissipation, \n\nknown as \u201cform\u201d losses, and this is considered to be the main source of energy loss in pumps, \n\nespecially at high specific speeds. Flow separations and secondary flows also increase the non-\n\nuniformity of a velocity distribution and, consequently, the losses. \n\n \n\n2.3.2.1 Localized losses \n\nThe localized losses occur at the inlet and outlet of the impeller and casing/diffuser. This is \n\ndue to the sudden change of section area and also because of the shift from a rotating component \n\nto a stationary one, or vice-versa. Fluid viscosity does not influence these losses, as they are \n\npurely inertial. \n\n \n\n2.3.2.2 Shock losses \n\nWhen the flow approaches the impeller or diffuser vanes at an incorrect angle, shock losses \n\noccur, as shown in Figure 6. These losses, which are also considered as vortex dissipation losses, \n\nare normally low at the design point and increase at off-design conditions with @A/A]_' ? 1C` , \nwhere x = 2 is usually assumed.  \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 6 - Effect of local flow separation at impeller or diffuser inlet (G\u00fclich, 2007). \n\n \n\nBecause of the complicated three-dimensional flow patterns, these losses cannot be \n\npredicted theoretically. Either empirical pressure loss coefficients are used for estimation or \n\nnumerical methods are employed. \n\n \n\n2.3.2.3 Losses due to secondary flow - Flow deflection caused by the vanes \n\nAccording to G\u00fclich (2007), the moment acting on the vanes can be considered a result of \n\nthe integral of the pressure and shear stress distributions across the vane surface (vane forces). It \n\ncan be determined that different flow conditions are found between vane pressure and suction \n\nsurfaces, since the pressure distributions result from the velocity distributions around the vanes. \n\nAccording to Stepanoff (1957), this pressure distribution profile makes the relative velocity \n\nat the suction side (SS) of the impeller vane be greater than the one at the pressure side (PS). As a \n\nresult, a smaller real differential pressure is generated at the impeller than if there were a uniform \n\nvelocity profile.   \n\n \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 7 - Slip phenomenon. a) Flow between the vanes; b) Secondary flow (G\u00fclich, 2007). \n\n \n\nFurthermore, the flow is not able to follow the exact contour of the vanes. It is the deviation \n\nbetween the vane and flow angles that makes the work transfer possible. The described \n\nphenomenon is quantified by the \u201cslip factor\u201d or by the \u201cdeviation angle\u201d and is shown in Figure \n\n7. \n\nGenerally, secondary flows are induced when the fluid is subjected to forces acting \n\nperpendicular to the main flow direction. These forces generate corresponding pressure gradients \n\nwhich are determined by the resultant of the centrifugal and Coriolis accelerations. Consequently, \n\nthe ratio of these accelerations, known as \u201cRossby number\u201d ab , determines the direction into \nwhich the flow will be deflected (G\u00fclich, 2007). \n\nIn theory, if ab  is near 1, no relevant secondary flow would be expected. If ab&lt;1, the \nCoriolis forces are dominant and the flow direction is towards the pressure side of the vane. On \n\nthe other hand, if ab>1, the flow direction is towards the suction side of the vane. \n \n\n2.3.2.4 Recirculation \n\nWhen a pump works significantly below the best efficiency point, it is said to be operating \n\nat partload. Since vane inlet angles and channel cross sections are too large for the reduced flow \n\nrate, flow patterns during partload are significantly different from those at the design point. The \n\nflow becomes highly tridimensional since it separates in the impeller and the collector. At \n\nsufficiently lower flow, recirculation is observed at impeller inlet and outlet. \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\nAccording to Fraser (1981), the total head produced is the sum of the centrifugal head and \n\nthe dynamic head. The centrifugal head is independent of the flow rate, but the dynamic head is a \n\nfunction of the absolute velocity and therefore is a function of the flow rate. At some capacity, \n\nthe dynamic head might exceed the centrifugal head, causing the pressure gradient to revert. The \n\ndirection of the flow reverses, which causes flow recirculation. \n\nRecirculation is a reversal of the flow at the inlet or at the discharge tips of the impeller \n\nvanes. All impellers display a start point of suction recirculation and a start point of discharge \n\nrecirculation at some specific capacity, and the effects of recirculation can be very damaging \n\ndepending on the size and speed of the pump. Therefore, the starting point of suction \n\nrecirculation has to be considered when defining the pump\u2019s minimum flow. Furthermore, the \n\nstarting point of discharge recirculation has to be analyzed due to its influence on the pump \n\nefficiency, especially in large specific speed pumps. \n\n \n\n2.3.3 Secondary losses \n\nSecondary losses also cause fluid heat and they have to be taken into account as power \n\nlosses. However they are not considered as pressure (head) losses. \n\n \n\n2.3.3.1 Disk friction losses \n\nWhen a circular disk or a cylinder rotates in a fluid, shear stresses corresponding to the \n\nlocal friction coefficient occur on its surface. The friction coefficient depends on the Reynolds \n\nnumber and the surface roughness. \n\nIf the body rotates in a casing (as is the case in a pump) the velocity distribution between \n\ncasing and rotating body depends on the distance between the impeller shroud and the casing wall \n\nas well as on the boundary layers which form on the stationary and rotating surfaces. In other \n\nwords, ? = -Q can no longer be assumed.  \nThe disk friction losses in a pump depend on the following parameters: Reynolds number, \n\nroughness of the rotating disk and casing wall, axial sidewall gap, shape of the casing and size of \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\nthe impeller sidewall gap, influencing the boundary layer and leakage flow through the impeller \n\nsidewall gap, partload recirculation and exchange of momentum. \n\nThe last three parameters can severely influence the disk friction loss and render its \n\ncalculation quite uncertain, especially with large leakage flows and at partload. Even at the best \n\nefficiency point, the tolerance of the calculated disk friction loss is estimated to be about 25%.  \n\nThe share of disk friction losses in the power consumption of a pump drops exponentially \n\nwith increasing specific speed and increasing head coefficient. With low specific speeds disk \n\nfriction is the main source of loss and can achieve up to 30% of the useful power of the impeller. \n\n \n\n2.3.3.2 Leakage losses \n\nClose running clearances between impeller and casing/diffuser or on axial thrust balance \n\ndevices limit the leakage from the impeller outlet to the inlet. Any leakage reduces the pump \n\nefficiency. Since the entire mechanical energy transferred by the impeller to the leakage flow (i.e. \n\nthe increase of the static head and the kinetic energy) is throttled in the seal and converted into \n\nheat, one percent of leakage flow also means an efficiency loss of one percent (G\u00fclich, 2007). \n\n \n\n2.3.3.3 Mechanical losses \n\nThe mechanical losses are generated by the radial and axial bearings and by the shaft seals. \n\nOccasionally these losses include auxiliary equipment driven by the pump shaft. \n\nThe mechanical efficiency of large pumps is around 99.5% or even above. In contrast, the \n\nmechanical losses of small pumps (say below 5 kW) can use up a considerable portion of the \n\ncoupling power. Examples are process pumps which are often equipped with dual mechanical \n\nseals. \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\n2.4 Head curve prediction methods \n\nAs already mentioned, in literature, there are several proposed models based on fluid \n\ndynamic principles and experimental data that attempt to predict the hydraulic performance of \n\ncentrifugal pumps. There are also various methods to calculate a pump\u2019s performance with \n\nnumerical simulation. Some of these methods are presented below. \n\nPatel et al. (1981) presents a theoretical model to predict the whole head curve of \n\ncentrifugal pumps based on fluid dynamic principles, over a wide range of specific speeds, \n\nconsidering various sizes and types of pumps. The head curve is presented as being the Euler \n\nhead minus friction and shock losses. The results are found to be in good agreement with the \n\nexperimental data of more than 50 pumps, with an error of \u00b1 3%. \n\nSun &amp; Tsukamoto (2001) presents a CFD model to predict off-design performance of \n\ndiffuser pumps, a condition in which the effects of rotor/stator interaction and the pump system \n\ncharacteristics become significant. The predicted head curve is validated by experimental data. \n\nThe model produces a good prediction of pump off-design performance. \n\nLi et al. (2002) affirms that most published guidelines for the selection and design of \n\ncentrifugal pumps are based on performance data collected before 1960, on pump designs of the \n\n1920\u2019s and 1950\u2019s. It analyzes the performance of a modern pump in an attempt to update the \n\ninformation. According to this work, calculating the performance of a modern pump from the \n\navailable published guidelines may lead to discrepancies of up to 10% from the real performance. \n\nSun &amp; Prado (2003) presents a single-phase model based on fluid dynamic principles, for \n\ndifferent ESP pump types, liquid properties and motor speeds. Friction and shock losses are taken \n\ninto account. A comparison between the predicted performance and the pump performances \n\nbased on the Affinity Law is presented. \n\nAsuaje et al. (2005) presents a 3D-CFD simulation of the impeller and volute of a \n\ncentrifugal pump. This flow simulation is carried out for several impeller vane numbers and the \n\nrelate volute tongue positions. According to this work, the volute tongue causes an \n\nunsymmetrical flow distribution in the impeller, which is confirmed by experimental data. \n\nFinally, velocity and pressure fields are calculated for different flow rates. \n\nCheah et al. (2007) presents a numerical simulation of the internal flow in a centrifugal \n\npump impeller by using a three-dimensional Navier-Stokes code. Both design and off-design \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\nconditions are analyzed. The results show that the impeller passage flow at the design point is \n\nsmooth and follows the curvature of the vane. However, flow separation is observed at the \n\nleading edge due to non-tangential inflow conditions. When the centrifugal pump is operating \n\nunder off-design conditions, unsteady flow develops in the impeller passage. The results are \n\ncompared to experimental data over a wide range of flow and show good agreement. \n\nThin et al (2008) presents a method to predict the performance curves of a centrifugal \n\npumps based on fluid dynamic principles. The theoretical head, slip factor, shock losses, \n\nrecirculation and friction losses are taken into account. The pump considered in this work is a \n\nsingle-stage end suction centrifugal pump, with low specific speed. \n\nDas et al. (2010) presents a performance prediction method for centrifugal submersible \n\nslurry pumps, based on fluid dynamic principles. Initially, the head curve for clean water is \n\nconsidered as the theoretical head deducted by the head losses. Then, the effects of solid particle \n\nsize, specific gravity and concentration on pump slurry flow are shown. Finally, additional head \n\nlosses due to solid particles in the slurry are predicted and deducted from the clean water head to \n\nestablish the performance of centrifugal slurry pump. The performance prediction using this \n\nmethod is more accurate around the design flow rate and gives a more accurate prediction of \n\ncentrifugal slurry pump performance for mostly homogenous slurry than it does for \n\nheterogeneous slurry. \n\nJafarzadeh et al. (2011) presents a general three-dimensional numerical simulation of \n\nturbulent fluid flow in order to predict the velocity and pressure fields of a centrifugal pump. A \n\nlow specific speed, high speed pump is considered. A commercial CFD code is used. The \n\ncomparison between the resultant performance curves and experimental data shows acceptable \n\nagreement. Furthermore, the effect of the number of impeller vanes on the hydraulic efficiency \n\nand the effect of the position of the vanes with respect to the tongue of the volute on the start of \n\nthe separation are analyzed. \n\nEl-Naggar (2013) presents a one-dimensional flow procedure for the prediction of \n\ncentrifugal pump performance, based on principle theories of turbomachines, such as the Euler \n\nequation and the energy equation. The loss at the impeller exit associated to the slip factor and \n\nthe volute loss are estimated. The predicted curves are consistent with experimental \n\ncharacteristics of centrifugal pumps. \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\nShah et al. (2013) presents a critical review of the CFD analysis of centrifugal pumps along \n\nwith the future scopes for further improvements, since in recent years it has been observed a \n\ngrowing availability of computational resources and progress in the accuracy of numerical \n\nmethods. According to this work, the most active areas of research and development are the \n\nanalysis of two-phase flow, pumps handling non-Newtonian fluids and fluid-structure interaction. \n\nThe CFD approach provides many advantages compared to other approaches, but due to its \n\ntheoretical nature, validation with experimental results is highly recommended. \n\nBiazussi (2014) presents a simple single-phase approach, based on fluid dynamic \n\nprinciples, that defines the head versus flow rate curve. According to this approach, for fluids \n\nwith low viscosity, the head curve is a quadratic function of the flow rate, as expected. Some \n\nassumptions and simplifications were considered, so that the model would only depend on a few \n\naccessible hydraulic dimensions and the performance would be predicted with reasonable error. \n\n \n\nConsidering the aim of this work, the model presented by Biazussi (2014) is chosen as the \n\nstarting point, due to its simplicity and dependency on few and accessible data of the pumps. \n\n \n\n2.5 Shut-off head prediction \n\nAccording to Dyson (2002), for many years, much of the pump community's focus has \n\nconcentrated on improving prediction methods for best efficiency point conditions. But this is not \n\ntrue for the prediction methods available to estimate off-design performance. Investigations at \n\npartload operation are difficult. The area of off-design behavior that has received least attention is \n\nthe prediction of the level of head a pump produces when its discharge valve is closed and the \n\nflow through the pump approaches zero, the shut-off condition. \n\nDyson (2002) and Newton (1998) compared some shut-off head prediction methods \n\navailable in literature. These methods are either based on empirical data or developed from an \n\nanalytical approach, they are presented below. \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\n2.5.1 Stepanoff\u2019s method \n\nThe Euler equation simplified for the shut-off condition is presented as: \n\n$8 = Z??\n?\n\n? ^                    (16) \nOn this basis, many statistical investigations have attempted to modify this theoretical \n\nmaximum head by the application of a universal correction factor. \n\nStepanoff (1957) proposes the use of the factor cd, a constant, independent of the pump \ngeometry and equal to 0.585.  \n\n$8.d = cd Z??\n?\n\n? ^                    (17) \nThis factor was derived from a review of a number of centrifugal pumps. The spread of \n\nerror is over 20 per cent. \n\n \n\n2.5.2 Peck\u2019s method \n\nA similar correction factor for the Euler equation is proposed by Peck (1968), who also \n\nbased his work on statistical analysis of pump geometry. \n\n$8.'f = c'f Z??\n?\n\n? ^                   (18) \nHe suggested that the pump configuration affected this constant. In this way: \n\n\u2022 For single suction volute pumps, c'f  = 0.575; \n\u2022 For double suction volute pumps, c'f  = 0.625; \n\u2022 For multistage volute pumps, c'f  = 0.6. \n\nThe available data has shown that the spread of the results is still wide. \n\n \n\n2.5.3 Patel\u2019s method \n\nAccording to Patel (1981), the specific speed of the pump has an influence on the shut-off \n\nhead. Typically, a low specific speed pump may have a flat performance curve, while a high \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\nspecific speed one may have a higher head rise to shut-off. Patel (1981) proposes the following \n\ncorrection factor to the Euler equation: \n\n$8.'? = c'? Z??\n?\n\n? ^                   (19) \nc'? = 0.65 ? 0.00344./                  (20) \nThe specific speed ni is calculated with metric units. The range of specific speed of the \n\npumps analyzed by Patel is from 12 to 50. \n\nUsing the database to separate out pump configuration, the difference between each pump \n\ntype becomes apparent. The data suggests that this method can be further modified to also take \n\ninto account the pump configuration. The Patel\u2019s modified correction factor would then be: \n\n\u2022 For single suction pumps:  \n\n$8.'?.j?? = +k.Nl8.m7nOo8.8887?p                  (21) \n\u2022 For double suction pumps:  \n\n$8.'?.j?? = +k.Nl8.mm5:o8.8887?p                  (22) \n\u2022 For multistage pumps:  \n\n$8.'?.j?? = +k.Nl8.;OOmo8.8885?p                   (23) \nAccording to Dyson (2002), this method presents an increased accuracy compared to the \n\nprevious ones. \n\n \n\n2.5.4 Thorne\u2019s method \n\nThorne (1988) proposes a correction factor for the Euler equation based on empirical \n\nconstants for the impeller and casing: \n\n$8.q = Z??\n?\n\n? ^ rZ\n7\n\n?s\nt^ ? Z\n?uv\n5?u ^ Z9\n\n5 + ]??s\nt?^w                (24) \nxyz{ = 1 + Z?|^ Z\n\n7o[?\nn8 ^ Z\n\n5\n7}@?u/??C?^                 (25) \n\nThe casing factor in the slip equation ~ = 0.77, z is the number of impeller vanes, D7j is the \ninlet meridional velocity. A is the ratio of the impeller inlet and outlet radius and B is the ratio of \n\nthe inlet radius and the cutwater radius. \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\nThis method attempts to consider the impeller inlet and outlet diameters, which have \n\ninfluence on recirculation, causing negative effects on the shut-off head. The slip represents the \n\neffect of the impeller vane geometry. The casing is taken into account by the use of an \n\nempirically derived coefficient. The pump configuration is not taken into account. \n\nAccording to Dyson (2002), this method consistently overpredicts the value of the shut-off \n\nhead, with errors of over 20 per cent. \n\nAs proposed by Dyson (2002), the accuracy of Thorne\u2019s method could be increased by the \n\nuse of the following correction factors, according to the pump configuration: \n\n\u2022 For single suction pumps 1/1.31; \n\n\u2022 For double suction pumps 1/1.1; \n\n\u2022 For multistage pumps 1/1.36. \n\n \n\n2.5.5 Stirling\u2019s method \n\nStirling (1982) proposes that the shut-off head be composed of three components: impeller \n\ncontribution (as if the impeller were a solid body), volute contribution and inlet backflow (when \n\nliquid exits from the impeller eye and flows into the inlet channel). \n\n$8.d?.\njt = 75? Z?55 ?\n?u?\n5 ^                  (26) \n\n$8.d?.??s = ??\n?\n\n5? Z?8 ? ?\n??\n\n???@[?}??C? ?K 9a^                (27) \n?9 = 1.17? ? 3 Z'?[??? ^                  (28) \n?K = ?0.2331 Z?u??^ + 0.1952                  (29) \nwhere AR is the ratio of rotor outlet area to the volute throat area, ?8 is the slip factor, ?5 is \n\nthe impeller vane pitch at Q5 and D? is a coefficient which takes into account the thickness of a \nrotating disk when calculating its disk friction. \n\nThis prediction method attempts to consider the contribution of important geometric \n\nfeatures such as suction diameter, impeller diameter and volute. However it still relies on \n\nempirically derived constants. The pump configuration does not have a marked statistical effect \n\non the predicted head, but the method consistently underpredicts the shut-off head. \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\nTherefore, a modifying factor can be applied to the Stirling equation. \n\n$8.d?.j?? = +k.?l8.m::m}8.8888n?p                  (30) \n \n\n2.5.6 Frost and Nilsen\u2019s method \n\nFrost and Nilsen (1991) also proposes a method based on the contribution of the impeller \n\nand volute. However, while Stirling\u2019s method uses empirical coefficients, Frost and Nilsen\u2019s is \n\npurely analytical. The flow in the impeller is assumed to exhibit solid body rotation. \n\n$8.??.\njt = ??\n?\n\n5? ?1 ? Z\n?u\n??^\n\n5?                  (31) \nAccording to Newton, (1998), they were uncertain of the value of Q7 and identified three \n\npossibilities: the impeller vane inlet radius, the radius of the suction pipe or zero, due to the fact \n\nthat forced vortex rotation will spread to the centerline. \n\nThe volute contribution was obtained by assuming that the velocity distribution within the \n\ndiffuser satisfied the following three flow conditions: the velocity at the exit of the impeller is \n\nequal to the vane velocity, there is no net flow in the discharge duct, and there is continuity of the \n\nrecirculating flow in the volute. \n\n$8.??.??s = Z ???@?v}??C?^ rQj y. Z\n?3\n??^ ? 2Qj @QJ ? Q5C + Z\n\n?3?}???\n5 ^w\n\n7\n?             (32) \n\nwhere ? is the angular velocity of the impeller, QJ is the height from the impeller centerline \nto the throat, Qj  is (radius at tongue - QJ )/2 and Q5  is the radius at the middle of the throat. \nAccording to Dyson (2002), although this method doesn\u2019t consider the negative contribution \n\nfrom the backflow, it is more accurate than the previous methods. \n\nDyson (2002) also presents a modifying factor for the Frost and Nilsen\u2019s equation: \n\n$8.??.j?? = +k.??8.m5;5}8.8888O?p                  (33) \n \n\n2.5.7 G\u00fclich\u2019s method \n\nBased on numerous measurements in all types of centrifugal pumps, G\u00fclich (2007) presents \n\na graph of the pressure coefficient as a function of the specific speed. He also presents an \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\nestimate of the shut-off head. As with all statistics, the figures show mean values and mean errors \n\nbut do not permit any statement on possible deviation of the individual measurement which, in \n\nprinciple, can be of any magnitude (G\u00fclich, 2007). \n\nc = 5?+???

(36) \nwhere ./.K?? = 100. \n \n\nThe previous section clearly demonstrates that the shut-off head takes into account \n\nnumerous phenomena and its prediction is very complex. \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\n3 THEORETICAL MODEL  \n\nThe theoretical model used in this work is the one developed by Biazussi (2014) and it is \n\npresented below. This model establishes a method for the interpretation of the head versus flow \n\nrate of a centrifugal pump. The following premises are considered: \n\n\u2022 Homogeneous and single-phase flow; \n\n\u2022 One-dimensional and permanent flow; \n\n\u2022 Uniform flow through the impeller; \n\n\u2022 Constant speed; \n\n\u2022 Negligible torque due to superficial and field forces. \n\nDimensional analysis provides a better understanding of the flow and the physical effects \n\ninvolved before starting a theoretical and experimental analysis, allowing for the extraction of \n\ndata trends that would otherwise remain disorganized and incoherent.  \n\nThe differential pressure is a function of the head provided by the pump, while the head \n\ndepends on the volumetric flow rate (A), speed (-), density (\"), viscosity (>), impeller diameter \n(\t5) and other hydraulic dimensions (?\n ). \n\n!? = ?7@A, -, \", >, \t5, ?\n C                  (37) \nAs previously shown in Chapter 2, through dimensional analysis, we can derive the \n\nfollowing equations:  \n\nCapacity coefficient: D* = *0??2                 \nHead coefficient: D+ = &amp;'(0????                  \nViscosity coefficient: F = M(0??? =\n\n7\nK?L                \n\nGeometric coefficients:  \n??\n??                 (38) \n\nAs a result: \n\nD+ = ? ZD* , F, ????^     ?     \n&amp;'\n\n(0???? = $7 Z\n*\n\n0??2 ,\nM\n\n(0??? ,\n??\n??^     ?     D+ = $7 ZD* , F,\n\n??\n??^      (39) \n\n \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\nA generic expression for $7  has to be defined based on physical phenomena. The \ncorrelations have to be adjusted to the experimental data. The pump geometry is taken into \n\naccount by the model adjustment coefficients. \n\nThe differential pressure provided by the pump can be calculated by subtracting the \n\nhydraulic pressure losses from the Euler differential pressure: \n\n!? = !?_?s?? ? !?s?????                   (40) \nwhere: \n\n!?_?s?? = \"-5Q55 Z1 ? * ????[?5\\]?0???^                 (41) \nAnd Q5 = \t5 2?  .                     (42) \nThe Euler differential pressure can also be written as: \n\n!?_?s?? = 7J \"-5\t55 ? ?7\n(0*\n\n??                   (43) \nwhere ?7 = ??  ??? [?5\\]?                   (44) \nAnd according to the dimensional analysis, the Euler head curve is written as: \n\nD+ _?s?? = 7J ? ?7D*                   (45) \nThe hydraulic pressure losses are composed of the friction, localized and distortion losses: \n\n!?s????? = !???\n??\n?? + !?s?? + !??\n?????\n??                (46) \nThe friction losses are expressed by an equivalent friction factor, which is composed of a \n\nturbulent term and a viscous term: \n\n!???\n??\n?? = ? ????\n(\n5 Z\n\n*\n??^\n\n5 = ?? ?\"-5\t55 Z *0??2^\n5\n               (47) \n\n? = ?5? M??(* + ?:? Z\nM??\n(* ^\n\n?\n                  (48) \n\nwhere 9? = 2\u00a0Q?6\u00a2 ,  ?5 = ?? ?5 ?  and  ?: = ?? ?:?. Therefore, it follows that: \n!???\n??\n?? = r?5 ZM??(* ^ + ?: Z\n\nM??\n(* ^\n\n?w \"-5\t55 Z *0??2^\n5              (49) \n\nwhere . expresses the viscous effect in high flow rate and is always smaller than 1. \nAccording to the dimensional analysis, the friction head losses are written as: \n\nD+ ??\n??\n?? = r?5 ZM??(* ^ + ?: Z\nM??\n(* ^\n\n?w D* 5                (50) \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\nThe localized losses are considered purely inertial and independent of the viscosity. They \n\nare represented by the sum of the dissipative losses that occur in the inlet and outlet of the \n\nimpeller and casing/diffuser. \n\n!?s?? = ?n\"-5\t55 Z *0??2^\n5\n                  (51) \n\nThe localized head losses are written according to the dimensional analysis as follows: \n\nD+ s?? = ?nD* 5                    (52) \nThe distortion losses represent the sum of the shock losses, losses due to secondary flow \n\nand recirculation losses.  \n\nFor a one-dimensional simple model, the effects of the recirculation losses, losses due to \n\nsecondary flow and shock losses overlap themselves, which makes it difficult to separate them. In \n\nthis model they are represented as just one type of loss, called distortion loss. \n\n!??\n?????\n?? = !?????f + !????.?s?\u00a3 + !????\n???s??\n??              (53) \nThe shock losses are inertial losses, caused by the misalignment of the fluid velocity with \n\nthe vane surface, when the pump operates out of BEP of the maximum diameter. \n\n!?????f = \"-5\t55?J r1 ? ?O? *0??2w\n5                 (54) \n\nwhere kO?  is based on pump geometry and is defined as: \n?O? = ??\n\n2 ??? [u\n5\\]u?u?                     (55) \n\nThe losses due to secondary flow also depend on the flow rate and are relevant at partload. \n\nSecondary flow can be caused by the difference between the pressure at the suction side and the \n\npressure at the pressure side of the impeller vanes, especially in the region closer to the vane \n\noutlet. \n\nThe recirculation losses occur inside the impellers and depend on the flow rate. These \n\nlosses are maximized at zero flow (G\u00fclich, 2007) and are expected to be zero at the best \n\nefficiency point. \n\nThe distortion losses are represented similarly to the shock losses, with similar equation, \n\nbut without an explicit definition for ?O?. Therefore, the distortion losses are defined as follows: \n!??\n?????\n?? = \"-5\t55?J r1 ? ?O *0??2w\n\n5\n                (56) \n\nAnd the distortion head losses are written as follows: \n\n\n\n30 \n \n\nD+ ?\n?????\n?? = ?J\u00a51 ? ?OD* \u00a6\n5\n                  (57) \n\nTherefore, the differential pressure curve can be understood as follows: \n\n!? = 7J \t55\"-5 ?\n*(0fu\n\n?? ?\n*?(?\u00a7?\u00a8\u00a9??\u00aa oZ\n\n\u00a7?\u00a8\n?\u00aa ^\n\n?f2?\n??3 ? \t5\n\n5\"-5?J Z1 ? *fI??20^\n5 ? *?(f\u00ab??3            (58) \n\nAccording to the dimensional analysis, it follows that: \n\nD+ = 7J ? ?J + @??7 ? F?5 + 2?J?OCD* + ?? \u00ac\n\u00ad\n\n??\u00ae\n?\n\n?: ? ?J?O5 ? ?n? D*5            (59) \nThe interpretation of the head versus flow rate curve of a centrifugal pump requires the \n\nexplicit definition of the coefficient ?7 from the pump geometry and the simultaneous adjustment \nof the other six dimensionless parameters (?5,  ?:,  ?J,  ?O,  ?n, .). \n\nWhen the fluid viscosity is low, the parameter F is very small (less than 10}; ) and its \ninfluence on the head curve can be neglected. In this case, the pump performance depends only \n\non the flow rate and pump geometry. \n\nD+ = ? ZD* , ????^                   (60) \nTherefore, the head curve is represented by the following equation: \n\nD+ = 7J ? ?J + @??7 + 2?J?OCD* + \u00af??J?O5 ? ?n\u00b0D*5              (61) \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\n4 TEST PROCEDURE AND PUMP TYPES  \n\nSince the tests used in the current work were not part of its scope, the test procedure is \n\npresented without many details. In Section 4.1 to 4.3, the test procedure with main followed \n\nrecommendations and main instruments is presented. They are in accordance with the Standard \n\nANSI/HI 14.6. In section 4.4, the different tested pump types are presented. \n\nAll the tests were performed according to the test procedure and test recommendations \n\npresented below.  \n\n \n\n4.1 Test procedure \n\nThe preferable layout for pump tests is a loop with the following characteristics: \n\n\u2022 Closed loop as applicable; \n\n\u2022 Pipe losses including valves shall allow for the full flow range to be measured; \n\n\u2022 Cooling and heat exchanger as necessary; \n\n\u2022 Possibility for degassing; \n\n\u2022 Measuring device for dissolved oxygen concentration. \n\nFor performance tests a closed test loop with a separate connected tank according to Figure \n\n9 is recommended. This layout ensures that no air gets into the loop after degassing. However, \n\nFigure 10 shows a simplified test loop with the main pipe going through the tank. This approach \n\nallows for a reduced cost piping layout with fewer valves and a simpler heat exchanger. The main \n\ndisadvantage of this set-up is that it is possible for air from the tank to re-saturate and/or reenter \n\nthe main pumping flow. Additionally the tank water level shall provide adequate submergence \n\nover the suction (tank outlet) pipe. \n\n \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 9 - Closed test loop with connected buffer tank \u2013 Horizontal pump. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10 - Open test loop from wet pit \u2013 Horizontal pump. \n\n \n\n4.2 Recommendations for the tests \n\nInlet flow disturbances, such as swirl, unbalance in the distribution of velocities and \n\npressures, and sudden variations in velocity can be disruptive to the hydraulic performance of a \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\npump, its mechanical behavior, and its reliability. The most disturbing flow patterns to a pump \n\nare those that result from swirling liquid that has traversed several changes of direction in various \n\nplanes.   \n\nWhen fittings, such as tees and elbows (especially two elbows at right angles) are located \n\ntoo close to the pump inlet (suction), a spinning action, or swirl, is induced. Higher energy and \n\nhigher specific speed pumps with lower NPSH margins are more sensitive to suction conditions. \n\nAdditionally double suction pumps are sensitive to uneven flow caused by an elbow in the plane \n\nof the shaft mounted on the suction flange which will direct more flow to one side of the impeller \n\nthan the other. \n\nFor the best performance test results, the fluid flow into the pump should be as smooth and \n\nuniform as possible. Therefore a straight section of pipe should be used at the pump inlet. \n\nGenerally 5 pipe diameters of straight pipe are required to ensure uniform flow. If the minimum \n\nrecommended pipe lengths cannot be provided, flow-straightening devices should be considered. \n\nBends, valves, etc. should be limited in the suction line, especially directly upstream of the \n\npump. The last elbow before the suction pipe shall be a long radius elbow. \n\nThe suction pipe shall be the same size as the pump suction nozzle. Piping leading to the \n\nsuction pipe shall be the same size or larger. If a smaller pipe is unavoidable, it shall be at least \n\n10 suction pipe diameters away from the pump suction. Also the fluid velocity and pressures \n\nshould be checked to ensure that there is a margin over vapor pressure. \n\nVelocities may be increased at the pump suction flange by the use of a gradual reducer (no \n\nmore than one pipe diameter reduction in a single reducer should be used). A concentric reducer \n\nis recommended for vertical inlet (suction) pipes, reducing the possibility of air or vapor \n\naccumulation. When piping reducers are required in horizontal suction pipe runs, they shall be of \n\nthe eccentric design oriented so as to not trap vapor (flat side up). \n\nAll inlet (suction) fitting joints shall be tight, especially when the pressure in the piping is \n\nbelow atmospheric, to prevent air leaking into the fluid. Care shall be taken to eliminate high \n\npoints in the suction piping which may collect vapor. Vents shall be located at all high points of \n\nthe suction piping. \n\nLong horizontal runs of pipe should be sloped slightly upwards in the direction of flow to \n\nallow the fluid flow to sweep air bubbles to a high point which is vented. \n\nThe main components used on the performance tests are the following: \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\n\u2022 Suction piping: pressured directly from the tank or by means of a booster pump; \n\n\u2022 Suction valve: necessary for the NPSH tests; \n\n\u2022 Suction pressure gauge; \n\n\u2022 Tested pump; \n\n\u2022 Driver (electric motor, turbine or diesel engine); \n\n\u2022 Discharge pressure gauge: placed after a reasonable straight pipe length in order to \n\nprovide a constant flow distribution; \n\n\u2022 Discharge valve; \n\n\u2022 Discharge piping; \n\n\u2022 Flowmeter; \n\n\u2022 Counter pressure valve. \n\nBefore the test, the following items are checked: pump and driver alignments, speed \n\ndirection, electric parts, suction and discharge pipes, and instrument position and calibration. \n\nDuring the test, the flow rate is controlled by the discharge valve. For each flow rate, the \n\nsuction and discharge pressure, the speed and power at shaft end are measured. During the test, \n\nthe bearings temperature and mechanical seal leakage are monitored. \n\nAt least five sets of readings are taken from the zero flow to 120% of the best efficiency \n\nflow (BEP). Points are chosen to include the shut off (if allowed), minimum flow, midway \n\nbetween minimum and rated flow, rated flow, BEP (if BEP is not within 5% of rated flow) and \n\n120% of rated flow. \n\nAll testing is conducted with water, which is free of contaminants, at temperatures less than \n\n55\u00b0C (130\u00b0F), or as otherwise specified. \n\nAdequate suction pressure is maintained for safe and smooth operation of the pump during \n\nperformance testing. Testing shall be performed within 50% to 120% of specified speed.  \n\nThe instruments used for the test must be able to accurately measure the performance at the \n\nrated flow point and ensure that each instrument reading is within 1/3 - 2/3 of the meter range \n\nunder rated working condition. \n\n\u2022 Capacity: flow is measured with either a calibrated venturi meter, dall tube or \n\norifice plate and a differential pressure gauge, transducer, or mercury manometer, or \n\na magnetic, ultrasonic or mass flow meter, with an electronic output; \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\n\u2022 Head: discharge pressure, and suction pressure when appropriate, is measured with \n\na transducer, pressure gauge, positive displacement type deadweight tester, or \n\nmanometer, with a correction added for the water surface or reference plane to \n\ngauge measurement. The differential head is calculated, including velocity heads, \n\nper the appropriate standard (ISO, HIS, or ASME); \n\n\u2022 Power: a digital power meter or a poly-phase wattmeter, in conjunction with current \n\nand potential transformers as necessary, is used to measure the input power to the \n\nmotor. The pump shaft power is computed using the calibration data of the motor \n\n(and gear as applicable). Alternatively a torque meter may be used; \n\n\u2022 Speed: a photo tachometer, electronic counter and a magnetic pick-up or a hand \n\nheld photo cell type digital counter is used to measure the pump shaft speed; \n\n\u2022 Elevation: gauge elevations are be measured with a measuring stick or tape \n\nmeasure. \n\nTable 1 presents the list of instruments used on the tests considered in this work. The \n\ninstruments accuracy is such that the accuracy at the measured points is the one presented in this \n\ntable. The tests were performed with the use of a data acquisition system and other computerized \n\ndata recording systems that are responsible for the calculation, performance curves plotting and \n\ntest report generation. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\nTable 1 - Instruments used during the tests and accuracy at the measured point. \n\nParameter Instrument \nAccuracy at the \n\nmeasured point \n\nFlow \nMagnetic or Ultrasonic Flow Meter, calibrated \n\nventuri or Dall tube, or standard orifice plate \n\u00b1 1.0% \n\nPressure \nBourdon or pressure gauge, manometer, or \n\npressure transducer \n\u00b1 0.5% \n\nSpeed Electronic revolution counter \u00b1 0.3% \n\nImpeller \n\ndiameter \nPaquimeter \u00b1 0.05 mm \n\nPower \nThree phase watt or power meter with current \n\nand potential transformers \n\u00b1 0.75% \n\nTorque Torque meter \u00b1 0.5% \n\nTemperature Resistance or thermocouple type with indicator \u00b1 1.0 oC \n\n \n\n4.3 Vertical pumps \n\nThe test procedure and recommendations for vertical pumps are similar to the ones for \n\nhorizontal pumps. Vertical pumps can be tested in a closed test loop with a suppression tank, \n\naccording to Figure 11. This layout ensures that no air gets into the loop after degassing. \n\nHowever Figure 12 shows the typical vertical pump testing arrangements in open wet pits. These \n\napproaches allow for reduced cost piping layout and testing. The main disadvantage of this set-up \n\nis it is impossible to de-aerate the system, therefore fully saturated water must be considered. \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 11 - Closed test loop through a suppression tank \u2013 Vertical pump. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 12 - Open test loop from wet pit \u2013 Vertical pump. \n\n \n\nWhen tested in an open loop (wet pit) the pumps suction shall have sufficient submergence \n\nto prevent air borne vortexes. For pumps with suction cans or containers the inlet suction pipe \n\nshall have a straight section of pipe. Generally 5 pipe diameters of straight pipe are required to \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\nensure uniform flow at the pressure measurement section. If the minimum recommended pipe \n\nlengths cannot be provided, flow-straightening devices should be considered.  \n\nThe main components used on the performance tests of vertical pumps are the following \n\nones: \n\n\u2022 Tested pump; \n\n\u2022 Driver (electric motor, turbine or diesel engine); \n\n\u2022 Discharge pressure gauge: placed after a reasonable straight pipe length in order to \n\nprovide a constant flow distribution; \n\n\u2022 Discharge valve; \n\n\u2022 Discharge piping; \n\n\u2022 Flowmeter; \n\n\u2022 Counter pressure valve. \n\n \n\n4.4 The tested pumps \n\nThe tests used in the current work were provided by a global pump manufacturer. Therefore \n\nit was possible to collect a big quantity of tests. The test data is shown in APPENDIX B. \n\nIn order to ensure the correspondence among the hydraulic dimensions of the pump, only \n\nperformance tests at the impeller maximum diameter have been considered, so that the impeller \n\noutlet angle ?5 and the impeller outlet width 65, for instance, would in fact correspond to the \nimpeller outlet diameter, \t5. \n\nFurthermore, it was possible to select tests of several types of pumps. These pump types are \n\ndescribed here according to the classification presented by the international standard API 610 \n\n11th edition, \u201cCentrifugal Pumps for Petroleum, Petrochemical and Natural Gas Industries\u201d. The \n\npump types used in this work are the following ones: OH2, BB1, BB2, BB3, BB4-BB5 and VS2. \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\n4.4.1 Pump type OH2 \n\nThe OH2 pumps are horizontal, centerline-mounted, single-stage overhung pumps, with \n\nsingle suction. They have a single bearing housing to absorb all forces imposed upon the pump \n\nshaft and maintain rotor position during operation. The pumps are mounted on a baseplate and \n\nare flexibly coupled to their drivers. \n\nThis pump type is widely used in off-shore and on-shore applications and also in the \n\ngeneral industry. \n\nTwenty-one tests of OH2 pumps were analyzed in this work, with a range of dimensionless \n\nspecific speeds from 0.11 to 0.83. \n\nFigure 13 represents a typical OH2 pump. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 13 - OH2 pump type. \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\n4.4.2 Pump type BB1 \n\nThe BB1 pumps are horizontal, between bearings, axial split, volute pumps, with double \n\nsuction impeller. According to the API 610 11th edition, this type of pump has one or two stages, \n\nbut in this work just the pumps with one stage are considered in the category. \n\nThese pumps are used especially in pipeline applications, refineries and in the water and \n\nwastewater markets. \n\nSeventeen tests of BB1 pumps were considered in this work, with a range of dimensionless \n\nspecific speeds from 0.31 to 1.35. These pumps have a larger impeller outlet width 65 , that \ncorresponds to the two sides of the impeller, which were used in the calculations. \n\nFigure 14 represents a typical BB1 pump. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 14 - BB1 pump type. \n\n \n\n\n\n41 \n \n\n4.4.3 Pump type BB2 \n\nThe BB2 pumps are horizontal, between bearings, radial split volute pumps with a double \n\nsuction impeller. According to the API 610 11th edition, this type of pump has one or two stages, \n\nbut in this work just the pumps with one stage are considered in the category. \n\nThis pump type is used in off-shore applications, such as SRU pumps, and in applications \n\nwith high temperature. \n\nIn this work, two tests of BB2 pumps were considered, with dimensionless specific speeds \n\nof 0.32 and 0.47. Like the BB1 pumps, the 65 used in the calculations corresponds to both sides \nof the impeller. \n\nFigure 15 represents a typical BB2 pump. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 15 - BB2 pump type. \n\n \n\n\n\n42 \n \n\n4.4.4 Pump type BB3 \n\nSimilar to the BB1 pumps, the BB3 are horizontal, between bearings, axial split volute \n\npumps, but with multiple stages. In this work the pumps with two stages or more are considered \n\nin this category.  \n\nThese pumps are also used in pipeline applications and in the water and wastewater \n\nmarkets, but in applications with more flow rate and pressure than the ones in which the BB1 \n\npumps are used. \n\nIn this work, nine tests of BB3 pumps were analyzed, with a range of dimensionless \n\nspecific speeds from 0.49 to 0.92. Like the BB1 and BB2 pumps, the 65 used in the calculations \ncorresponds to both sides of the impeller. Furthermore, the hydraulics were analyzed considering \n\njust one impeller. The pressure provided by the pump was divided by the number of stages of the \n\npump. \n\nFigure 16 and Figure 17 represent typical BB3 pumps. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 16 - BB3 pump type. \n\n \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 17 - BB3 pump type. \n\n4.4.5 Pump types BB4 and BB5 \n\nThe BB4 and BB5 pumps are horizontal, between bearings, radial split pumps, with \n\ndiffuser and multiple stages. BB4 pumps have a single-casing, while the BB5 ones have a double \n\ncasing (barrel). \n\nBB4 pumps are mainly used as boiler feed water pumps in the power market. BB5 pumps \n\nsupport the highest pressures and therefore are used in high reliability applications, such as \n\ninjection pumps on platforms. \n\nSince the hydraulics of BB4 and BB5 pumps are usually the same, they were considered as \n\na single group in this work. Twenty four tests were considered in this category. Like the BB3 \n\npumps, the hydraulics were analyzed considering just one impeller. The pressure provided by the \n\npump was divided by the number of stages of the pump. \n\nIn this work, twenty four tests of BB4-BB5 pumps were analyzed, with a range of \n\ndimensionless specific speeds from 0.24 to 0.50. \n\nFigure 18 and Figure 19 represent typical BB4 and BB5 pumps. \n\n \n\n\n\n44 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 18 - BB4 pump type. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 19 - BB5 pump type. \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\n4.4.6 Pump type VS2 \n\nWet pit, vertically suspended, single-casing volute pumps with discharge through the \n\ncolumn are designated as VS2 pumps. \n\nThese pumps are widely used in off-shore application, such as fire-fighting system and as \n\nseawater lift pumps. They are also used in the water and wastewater market. \n\nSeven tests of VS2 pumps were analyzed in this work, with a range of dimensionless \n\nspecific speeds from 0.89 to 1.49. It is important to note that, for vertical pumps, at the \n\ndifferential pressure calculation, the level difference between the bowl and the discharge nozzle \n\nhas to be taken into account, as well as the pressure losses at the column pipe.  \n\nFigure 20 represents a typical VS2 pump. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 20 - VS2 pump type. \n\n \n\n\n\n46 \n \n\nIn total, eighty tests were analyzed in the current work, with a range of dimensionless \n\nspecific speeds from 0.11 to 1.49. Six different types of pump were considered, including volute \n\nand diffuser pumps, single and double suction, horizontal and vertical, single or multistage. This \n\ndiversity on the tests is essential for the validation of the proposed model. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n47 \n \n\n5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nInitially, the tests used in this work are presented. They are compared to the reference \n\ncurves provided by the pump manufacturer, which are henceforth referred to as theoretical \n\ncurves. This comparison is not shown for all the eighty tests considered in the current work, just \n\nfor two tests of each pump type. \n\nThen, the tested curves are compared to the ones adjusted by the model presented by \n\nBiazussi (2014). Again, this result is shown just for some tests. \n\nAfter that, the model equation coefficients are plotted against the pump specific speed in \n\norder to analyze the correlation among them. From the analysis of these correlations, equations \n\nare proposed, so that the coefficients can be defined from basic characteristics of the pumps, such \n\nas specific speed and main dimensions. As a result, the head curve against flow can be defined, \n\nonly based on these characteristics.  \n\nThen, the correlation based curves are compared to the tested curves and the difference \n\nbetween them is discussed. \n\nAfterwards, several shut-off head prediction methods are analyzed, so that the correlations \n\nproposed to predict the whole head curve can be improved. Then, the improved head curves are \n\nplotted against the correlation based and the tested ones and the difference among them is \n\ndiscussed. \n\nFinally the effectiveness of the proposed method to predict the head curve of centrifugal \n\npumps is evaluated. \n\n \n\n5.1 Tested versus theoretical curves \n\nFigure 21 presents a selection of tested flow versus head curves over the related theoretical \n\nones provided by the pump manufacturer. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n48 \n \n\n      \n\n       \n\n       \n\n       Figure 21 - Theoretical and tested curves. \n\n \n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\n0.12\n\n0.14\n\n0.16\n\n0 0.002 0.004 0.006 0.008 0.01\n\nC\nH\n\nCQ\n\nOH2 - Test 17\n\nTested Theoretical\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\n0.12\n\n0.14\n\n0.16\n\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025\n\nC\nH\n\nCQ\n\nOH2 - Test 20\n\nTested Theoretical\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\n0.12\n\n0.14\n\n0.16\n\n0.18\n\n-3.47E-18 0.0025 0.005 0.0075 0.01 0.0125\n\nC\nH\n\nCQ\n\nBB1 - Test 23\n\nTested Theoretical\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\n0.12\n\n0.14\n\n0.16\n\n0.18\n\n0 0.0025 0.005 0.0075 0.01 0.0125 0.015\n\nC\nH\n\nCQ\n\nBB1 - Test 26\n\nTested Theoretical\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\n0.12\n\n0.14\n\n0.16\n\n0.18\n\n0 0.002 0.004 0.006 0.008\n\nC\nH\n\nCQ\n\nBB2 - Test 39\n\nTested Theoretical\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\n0.12\n\n0.14\n\n0.16\n\n0.18\n\n-5.2E-18 0.0025 0.005 0.0075 0.01 0.0125 0.015\n\nC\nH\n\nCQ\n\nBB2 - Test 40\n\nTested Theoretical\n\n\n\n49 \n \n\n      \n\n      \n\n      \n\nFigure 21 - Theoretical and tested curves (continued). \n\n  \n\nThe calculation method for the flow and head coefficient errors is presented in APPENDIX \n\nA.

The test standards already allow for certain tolerances in the test results. So there \n\nis a margin to accommodate these variations. \n\nThe curves considered as reference for the model adjustment and the analysis of the results \n\nare the tested ones, since they represent the real performance of the pumps considered in this \n\nwork.  \n\n \n\n5.2 Model adjustment for the head curve \n\nThe model adjustment proposed in Equation (61) was done by the software Wolfram \n\nMathematica \u2122 version 9.0.1. The \u201cFindFit\u201d function was used to find the numerical values of \n\nthe equation coefficients that best fit the input data. The adjustment is based on the minimization \n\nof the norm, calculated as follows: \n\nP\u00b1Q\u00b2 = 19\u00b3x@\u00b4C5 + 9\u00b3x@\u00b5C5 + 9\u00b3x@\u00b6C5 + ? + 9\u00b3x@.C5              (62) \nwhere . is the quantity of input data and the variables x, y and z are the deviation between \n\nthe tested and the calculated values. \n\n0.1\n\n0.11\n\n0.12\n\n0.13\n\n0.14\n\n0.15\n\n0.16\n\n0 0.002 0.004 0.006 0.008 0.01\n\nC\nH\n\nCQ\n\nOH2 - Test 17\n\nTested Theoretical\n\n\n\n51 \n \n\nThe coefficient ?7 is defined based on the pump geometry, according to Equation (44).

The data of test 40 (BB2 pump) was used on this analysis. The \n\nrange of ?5 considered was from 15\u00b0 up to 37.5\u00b0. Figure 24 shows the head curve predicted by \nthe model considering all the values of ?5. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 24 - Influence of \u00b8\u00b9 on the calculated curve. \n \n\nThe bigger ?5 the lower the predicted head losses and, consequently, the flatter the head \ncurve. Based on these results, it is possible to conclude that ?5 in fact influences the shape of the \nhead curve. This conclusion was already expected, since ?5 is one of the hydraulic parameters \nthat define ?7, which multiplies D* in the model equation. \n\n0.06\n\n0.07\n\n0.08\n\n0.09\n\n0.1\n\n0.11\n\n0.12\n\n0.13\n\n0.14\n\n0.15\n\n0.16\n\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015\n\nC\nH\n\nCQ\n\nBB2 - Test 40 - Influence of ????2\n\nTested 15\u00b0 17.5\u00b0 20\u00b0\n\n22.5\u00b0 25\u00b0 27.5\u00b0 30\u00b0\n\n32.5\u00b0 35\u00b0 37.5\u00b0\n\n\n\n54 \n \n\nThe real value of ?5 is 20.8\u00b0, but according to Figure 24, the curve that best predicted the \nshape of the head curve was the one with ?5 = 32.5\u00b0, but presenting an off-set that might be \nrelated to an error on the shut-off head prediction. \n\nAdditionally, in order to evaluate the effect of a missing ?5, the model was also run without \n?5 and adjusting ?7 based on the tested data.

This analysis was done by Biazussi \n\n(2014), but only with a few test results, and the correlations found among the coefficients and the \n\nspecific speed were linear, as shown in Figure 30. \n\n \n\n      \n\n \n\nFigure 30 - Equation coefficients vs. specific speed for the tests analyzed by Biazussi (2014). \n\n \n\nBiazussi (2014) has even suggested that more tested data should be used in order to better \n\nunderstand these correlations. And this is the biggest contribution of the current work. With the \n\ndata from eighty tests, it was possible to evaluate these correlations and, in fact, they proved not \n\nto follow straight lines. \n\nIn Figure 31 to 34, the equation coefficients k7, kJ, kO and kn adjusted by the model for all \nthe tests are plotted as functions of the dimensionless specific speed. The points are grouped \n\naccording to the pump type, but it is possible to notice tendencies when analyzing the results of \n\nall the pump types together. \n\nk4/(D2-D1) = 1.39254*Ns + 1.14064\nR\u00b2 = 0.99636\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4\n\nk\n4\n\n/\n(D\n\n2\n-D\n\n1\n)\n\nNs\n\nk5 = -16.68327*Ns + 30.01438\nR\u00b2 = 0.99870\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4\nk\n\n5\n\nNs\n\nk6 = 8141.52472*e-4.89234*Ns\n\nR\u00b2 = 0.99363\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4\n\nk\n6\n\nNs\n\n\n\n59 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 31 - Equation coefficient \u00ba\u00bb vs. specific speed. \n \n\n \n\nFigure 32 - Equation coefficient \u00ba\u00bc vs. specific speed. \n \n\nk1 = 1.5641*Ns-1.214\n\nR\u00b2 = 0.6202\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6\n\nk\n1\n\nNs\n\nOH2 BB1 BB2 BB3 BB4 - BB5 VS2 Power (Tendency)\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\n0.12\n\n0.14\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6\n\nk\n4\n\nNs\n\nOH2 BB1 BB2 BB3 BB4 - BB5 VS2\n\n\n\n60 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 33 - Equation coefficient \u00ba\u00bd vs. specific speed. \n \n\n \n\nFigure 34 - Equation coefficient \u00ba\u00be vs. specific speed. \n \n\nThe coefficients ?7 , ?O  and ?n  could be represented as functions of the dimensionless \nspecific speed directly.

The correlation presented in Figure 31 should be used only \n\nin case one of the hydraulic parameters that define ?7  is not available, for instance ?5 , as \ndiscussed in section 5.2.1. \n\nWith regard to the coefficient ?J, it is also recommended that its value be obtained based \non the correlations presented in Table 2. However, if the hydraulic parameter \t7 is not available, \nit is possible to approximate ?J to 0.1, according to Figure 32. \n\nThis simplification is in line with Stepanoff\u2019s method for the shut-off head prediction, as \n\nshown below: \n\nAccording to the Euler head equation, Equation (45), the head at shut-off is: \n\nD+ 8._?s?? = 0.25                   (66) \nAs shown in Chapter 2, Stepanoff (1957) proposes the use of the correction factor cd for \n\nthe Euler head, having a constant value of 0.585.

The standard deviation limit set to define good accuracy is 0.02. This behavior \n\nwas observed in all the pump types. \n\nIn some cases (10 tests), the correlations (Table 2) were able to predict the shape of the \n\ntested curve, but an offset was observed due an error on the shut-off head prediction. This \n\nbehavior was observed in few cases of all pump types. \n\nIn few cases (6 tests), the shape of the curve was not well predicted. This behavior was \n\nobserved in 2 tests of BB1 pumps and 4 tests of BB3 pumps. It happened more critically with the \n\ntests of BB3 pumps, but it is important to note that the pump hydraulics was the same in these 4 \n\ntests.  \n\nAs already mentioned, there are several proposed models to predict the hydraulic \n\nperformance of centrifugal pumps in literature. However, even the best CFD simulations can\u2019t \n\npredict the pump performance accurately.  \n\nThe correlations proposed between the equation coefficients and the basic information of \n\nthe pumps represent the mean tendency among a huge amount of experimental data from several \n\ntypes of pumps. Therefore the provided values of the coefficients may not be so accurate in some \n\ncases. \n\nGiven all the assumptions and simplifications, the objective of this work is to present \n\ncorrelations applicable to several pump types that easily provide a prediction of the head curve \n\nwith reasonable error. This error is natural and expected. Since pumps have numerous \n\nconfigurations and their hydraulics are very complex, it is not expected that their performance be \n\naccurately predicted with only a handful of parameters. \n\nTherefore, considering the goal of this work and all the tested data used to validate it, it is \n\npossible to affirm that the proposed correlations (Table 2) are able to easily predict the head \n\ncurve of pumps in several different configurations with reasonable error. \n\n \n\n5.4.1 Previous work curves predicted based on the correlations \n\nThe three pumps tested by Biazussi (2014) are multistage pumps, with 3 stages and \n\ndiffusers. Therefore they are considered BB4 pumps. They are called P23, P47 and P100, with \n\n\n\n66 \n \n\nspecific speeds of 28, 46 and 68, in SI units, respectively. Each one of these pumps was tested in \n\nthree speeds. Therefore 9 tests are available. \n\nFor all the tests, the coefficients ?7, ?J, ?O and ?n were adjusted by the model presented by \nBiazussi (2014) and their values were plotted over the curve with the coefficients calculated for \n\nall the 80 tests presented in this work.

It is important to \n\nmention that, even with specific speeds in the same range of the ones of the 80 tests, these pumps \n\nare very small. Therefore, the pressure losses tend to be more relevant than the ones in big \n\npumps. \n\nAmong these three pumps, it is possible to notice that the bigger the pump, the closer its \n\npredicted curve to the tested one. P100 is bigger than P23 and P47, which could explain why the \n\nlosses were not underestimated. The deviation on the curve could be associated to the deviation \n\nobserved on ?n. \n \n\n0\n\n0.04\n\n0.08\n\n0.12\n\n0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05\n\nC\nH\n\nCQ\n\nP100 - 3000 rpm\n\nTested Correlation based\n\n0\n\n0.04\n\n0.08\n\n0.12\n\n0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06\n\nC\nH\n\nCQ\n\nP100 - 2400 rpm\n\nTested Correlation based\n\n0\n\n0.04\n\n0.08\n\n0.12\n\n0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08\n\nC\nH\n\nCQ\n\nP100 - 1800 rpm\n\nTested Correlation based\n\n\n\n69 \n \n\n5.5 Improvement on the shut-off head prediction \n\nAs mentioned previously, for many years, much of the pump community's focus has been \n\non improving prediction methods for best efficiency point conditions. The design of machines \n\nhas evolved to such an extent that their efficiencies now approach the theoretical values and their \n\ndesign points can be estimated to within a few percentage points. This cannot be said of the \n\nprediction methods available to estimate off-design performance. Investigations at partload \n\noperation are difficult. The flow is impulsive, unsteady and strongly influenced by the time \n\ndependent nature of the rotor/stator interactions. The area of off-design behavior that has received \n\nleast attention is the prediction of the level of head a pump produces when its discharge valve is \n\nclosed and the flow through the pump approaches zero, the shut-off condition. \n\nNot surprisingly, the main source of error on the correlation based curves was the shut-off \n\nhead prediction. The offset observed between the correlation based and the tested curves in some \n\ncases is related to the error on the shut-off head prediction.  \n\nFor this reason, some of the shut-off prediction methods presented in Chapter 2 were \n\nanalyzed and used to optimize the correlations proposed to predict the head curve (Table 2) by \n\nchanging the equation coefficient ?J. \nAccording to the Equation (61), at shut-off (D* = 0), the head coefficient D+ = 1 4? ? ?J. \n\nTherefore, from the shut-off head estimated by the several shut-off prediction methods, it is \n\npossible to calculate the related ?J  to be used on the whole head curve prediction. The \ncoefficients ?7, ?O and ?n remain the same ones based on the correlations (Table 2). \n\nIt is important to notice that the improved prediction of ?J has also an influence on the \nshape of the curve, since this coefficient also multiplies D* and D*5 . \n\nFor each test and each one of these methods, the shut-off head was calculated and used to \n\nestimate the value of ?J and then the whole head curve was raised. \nIn this work, improved curves are the head versus flow curves predicted based on the \n\ncorrelations presented in Table 2 and improved by a shut-off head prediction method presented in \n\nChapter 2.  \n\nThe standard deviation of the improved curves was used to compare them to the tested \n\ncurve and also among themselves. As a consequence, it was possible to identify the best \n\nprediction method for the whole head curve for each pump type. \n\n\n\n70 \n \n\nSince the goal of this work is to predict the pump hydraulic performance only with few and \n\naccessible hydraulic dimensions, some methods were discarded because they considered several \n\nhydraulic dimensions that are not easily obtained. This was the case of the Thorne\u2019s, Stirling\u2019s \n\nand Frost and Nilsen\u2019s methods. \n\nThe methods analyzed are the ones proposed by Stepanoff (1957), Peck (1968), Patel \n\n(1981) and G\u00fclich (2007). The first three methods present correction factors to the Euler\u2019s \n\nequation, based on the statistical analysis of several test results. The fourth method is also based \n\non statistical data, but it presents a graph for the shut-off head prediction based on the specific \n\nspeed of the pump. These methods are presented in detail in Chapter 2. \n\nTable 3 presents the sum of the standard deviation (total standard deviation) of the \n\nimproved curves, grouped by pump type, for each method. \n\n \n\nTable 3 - Total standard deviation of the improved curves. \n\nMethods \nPump type \n\nOH2 BB1 BB2 BB3 BB4-BB5 VS2 \n\nCorrelations (Table 2) 0.22 0.25 0.031 0.24 0.24 0.12 \nStepanoff 0.14 0.24 0.04 0.21 0.38 0.11 \nPeck 0.15 0.25 0.027 0.21 0.32 0.11 \nPatel 0.17 0.33 0.04 0.29 0.39 0.14 \nG\u00fclich 0.15 0.24 0.04 0.24 0.28 0.08 \n\n \n\nFor the OH2 pumps, by using Stepanoff\u2019s method of shut-off head prediction to improve \n\nthe head curve predicted based on the correlations (Table 2), the total standard deviation drops in \n\n36%, from 0.22 to 0.14. \n\nWith regard to the BB1 pumps, besides Patel\u2019s, all the methods presented similar values of \n\ntotal standard deviation. The use of Stepanoff\u2019s or G\u00fclich\u2019s method presents total standard \n\ndeviation of 0.24, which is 4% smaller than the one calculated for the predicted curve based on \n\nthe correlations.  \n\nSince there are just two tests of BB2 pumps available, the total standard deviation is smaller \n\nthan the ones calculated for the other pump types. Even though, it is possible to evaluate the best \n\nmethod to predict the head curve. In this case, Peck\u2019s method presents the smallest total standard \n\n\n\n71 \n \n\ndeviation, 0.027, which is 13% smaller than the one calculated for the predicted curve based on \n\nthe correlations. \n\nConsidering all the tests of BB3 pumps, Stepanoff\u2019s and Peck\u2019s methods present the \n\nsmallest total standard deviation, 0.21. However, as mentioned previously, among the 9 tests of \n\nBB3 pumps, 4 of them had the same hydraulics and presented serious deviation on the prediction \n\nof the shape of the curve. This hydraulics is very peculiar and could not represent well the \n\nbehavior of this type of pump. If these tests are ignored, the smallest total standard deviation is \n\n0.013 with Stepanoff\u2019s method, against 0.017 based on the correlations and 0.022 with Peck\u2019s \n\nmethod. \n\nThe correlations (Table 2) predict the head curve of BB4-BB5 pumps better than all the \n\nother methods. In fact, the comparison of the correlation based curves with the tested ones shows \n\nthe smallest total standard deviation, 0.24. \n\nFor VS2 pumps, G\u00fclich\u2019s method presents the best head curve prediction, with total \n\nstandard deviation of 0.08. Even being vertical and with high specific speed (semi axial pumps), \n\nit was possible to find a good method to predict the head curve of VS2 pumps. \n\nComparisons among tested, correlation based and improved curves are presented in Figure \n\n39. The standard deviation among these correlation based, improved and tested curves are \n\npresented in Table 4. In all cases, besides test 75, the standard deviation of the improved curve is \n\nsmaller than the one of the correlation based curve. Test 75 represents the exceptions, which \n\nmeans that the method chosen as the best one to predict the head curves of a certain pump type \n\ndoesn\u2019t correspond to the best method to predict the head curve in this particular case. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n72 \n \n\nTable 4 - Standard deviation of the correlation based and improved curves of the selected tests. \n\nStandard deviation \n\nTest Pump type \nCorrelation \n\nbased curve \n\nImproved \n\ncurve \n\nStd. \n\ndeviation \n\nreduction \n\n17 OH2 0.0090 0.0028 68.5% \n20 OH2 0.0085 0.0010 88.7% \n23 BB1 0.0110 0.0093 15.4% \n26 BB1 0.0219 0.0061 72.4% \n39 BB2 0.0202 0.0171 15.3% \n40 BB2 0.0109 0.0099 9.1% \n42 BB3 0.0059 0.0027 53.7% \n48 BB3 0.0067 0.0049 26.7% \n54 BB4-BB5 0.0081 - - \n65 BB4-BB5 0.0097 - - \n75 VS2 0.0136 0.0203 -48.9% \n80 VS2 0.0095 0.0042 56.5% \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n73 \n \n\n      \n\n      \n\n      \n\nFigure 39 - Correlation based, improved and tested curves. \n\n \n\n0.0000\n\n0.0500\n\n0.1000\n\n0.1500\n\n0.2000\n\n0.0000 0.0020 0.0040 0.0060 0.0080 0.0100\n\nC\nH\n\nCQ\n\nOH2 - Test 17\n\nTested Correlation based Improved (Stepanoff)\n\n0.0000\n\n0.0500\n\n0.1000\n\n0.1500\n\n0.2000\n\n0.0000 0.0050 0.0100 0.0150 0.0200 0.0250 0.0300\n\nC\nH\n\nCQ\n\nOH2 - Test 20\n\nTested Correlation based Improved (Stepanoff)\n\n0.0000\n\n0.0500\n\n0.1000\n\n0.1500\n\n0.2000\n\n0.0000 0.0050 0.0100 0.0150\n\nC\nH\n\nCQ\n\nBB1 - Test 23\n\nTested Correlation based Improved (Stepanoff)\n\n0.0000\n\n0.0500\n\n0.1000\n\n0.1500\n\n0.2000\n\n0.0000 0.0050 0.0100 0.0150\n\nC\nH\n\nCQ\n\nBB1 - Test 26\n\nTested Correlation based Improved (Stepanoff)\n\n0.0000\n\n0.0500\n\n0.1000\n\n0.1500\n\n0.2000\n\n0.0000 0.0020 0.0040 0.0060\n\nC\nH\n\nCQ\n\nBB2 - Test 39\n\nTested Correlation based Improved (Peck)\n\n0.0000\n\n0.0500\n\n0.1000\n\n0.1500\n\n0.2000\n\n0.0000 0.0050 0.0100 0.0150\n\nC\nH\n\nCQ\n\nBB2 - Test 40\n\nTested Correlation based Improved (Peck)\n\n\n\n74 \n \n\n      \n\n      \n\n     \n\nFigure 39 \u2013 Correlation based, improved and tested curves (continued). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.0000\n\n0.0500\n\n0.1000\n\n0.1500\n\n0.2000\n\n0.0000 0.0050 0.0100 0.0150 0.0200\n\nC\nH\n\nCQ\n\nBB3 - Test 42\n\nTested Correlation based Improved (Stepanoff)\n\n0.0000\n\n0.0500\n\n0.1000\n\n0.1500\n\n0.2000\n\n0.0000 0.0100 0.0200 0.0300 0.0400\n\nC\nH\n\nCQ\n\nBB3 - Test 48\n\nTested Correlation based Improved (Stepanoff)\n\n0.0000\n\n0.0500\n\n0.1000\n\n0.1500\n\n0.2000\n\n0.0000 0.0020 0.0040 0.0060 0.0080\n\nC\nH\n\nCQ\n\nBB4-BB5 - Test 54\n\nTested Correlation based\n\n0.0000\n\n0.0500\n\n0.1000\n\n0.1500\n\n0.2000\n\n0.0000 0.0020 0.0040 0.0060 0.0080 0.0100\n\nC\nH\n\nCQ\n\nBB4-BB5 - Test 65\n\nTested Correlation based\n\n0.0000\n\n0.0500\n\n0.1000\n\n0.1500\n\n0.2000\n\n0.0000 0.0050 0.0100 0.0150 0.0200 0.0250\n\nC\nH\n\nCQ\n\nVS2 - Test 75\n\nTested Correlation based Improved (G\u00fclich)\n\n0.0000\n\n0.0500\n\n0.1000\n\n0.1500\n\n0.0000 0.0100 0.0200 0.0300 0.0400 0.0500\n\nC\nH\n\nCQ\n\nVS2 - Test 80\n\nTested Correlation based Improved (G\u00fclich)\n\n\n\n75 \n \n\n6 CONCLUSIONS \n\nIn literature, there are several models that attempt to predict the hydraulic performance of \n\ncentrifugal pumps. Some of them are based on fluid dynamic principles, but others are based on \n\nempirical data and there are also the modern ones based on numerical simulation. In order to \n\ndecide the best one to be used, the available information about the pump has to be taken into \n\naccount.  \n\nThe current work proposes correlations for the head curve prediction based on few and \n\naccessible pump characteristics. The data of eighty tests of different pump types are used, \n\ncovering a wide range of specific speeds. Even with simple input data, results with reasonable \n\naccuracy are obtained. \n\nIn addition, the use of simple shut-off head prediction methods increases the accuracy of the \n\nwhole pump head curve predicted by the correlations (Table 2). This combination does predict \n\nthe pump hydraulic performance with acceptable accuracy only with few and accessible \n\nhydraulic dimensions. \n\nTo summarize, the recommended methods to predict whole head curve for each pump type \n\nare the following ones: \n\n\u2022 Correlations (Table 2) + Stepanoff\u2019s method for OH2, BB1 and BB3 pumps; \n\n\u2022 Correlations (Table 2) + Peck\u2019s method for BB2 pumps; \n\n\u2022 Correlations (Table 2) for BB4-BB5 pumps; \n\n\u2022 Correlations (Table 2) + G\u00fclich\u2019s method for VS2 pumps. \n\n  \n\n\n\n76 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n77 \n \n\n7 RECOMMENDATION FOR FUTURE PROJECTS \n\nOne of the assumptions considered on the theoretical model was that the effects of the \n\nrecirculation losses, losses due to secondary flow and shock losses overlap themselves, which \n\nmakes it difficult to separate them. Therefore, they were represented as just one type of loss, \n\ncalled distortion loss. \n\nIn fact, all of them depend on the flow rate, tend to a minimum value at the best efficiency \n\npoint and are more critical at partload. However it would be important to know the contribution \n\nof each component. \n\nThe correlation found between the equation coefficient ?J and the specific speed depends \non \t7 \t5? . It would be valuable if this ratio could be considered since the theoretical model \ndefinition. \n\nSince the energy consumption has always been an issue, for sure the best complement for \n\nthis work would be the analysis of the available data also with regard to the pump power, so that \n\nit would be possible to predict the power consumption of a centrifugal pump only with few and \n\naccessible hydraulic dimensions. \n\n  \n\n\n\n78 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n79 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nANSI/HI 1.4.

This uncertainty is the result of a lack of information regarding the \n\nparameter being measured. In other words, infinite information would be necessary to define its \n\nexact value. Therefore, when experimental data is presented, its error needs to be informed. \n\nThe error is calculated according to normalized procedures. INMETRO presents general \n\nrules for the experimental error evaluation. Two types of errors are considered: \n\n\u2022 Error type A: based on the statistical analysis of a series of measured data; \n\n\u2022 Error type B: based on other examinations not based on statistical analysis. \n\nSince the data acquisition was not part of the scope of this work, only one measure of each \n\nparameter was available. Therefore, the errors considered in this work are of type B, with the \n\nexception of the density error. \n\n \n\nA.1 \u2013 Combined error \n\n \n\nCombined error can be understood as the standard deviation of a variable \u00b6 based on the \nstandard deviation of its dependent variables, \u00b4 and \u00b5, according to the equation below: \n\n?|5 = Z\u00c3|\u00c3` ?` ^\n5 + Z\u00c3|\u00c3\u00c4 ?\u00c4 ^\n\n5\n                 (A.1) \n\nwhere ?`  and ?\u00c4  are the errors associated to the variables \u00b4  and \u00b5 , and ?|  is the error \nassociated to variable \u00b6. \n\n \n\nA.2 \u2013 Combined error of the differential pressure provided by the pump \n\n \n\nThe differential pressure provided by the pump is obtained based on the pressure measured \n\nat the suction and discharge of the pump, according to the equation below: \n\n?? = ??\n??????? ? ?????\n??               (A.2) \nwhere ??\n???????  is the pressure measured at the discharge of the pump and ?????\n?? is the \n\npressure measured at the suction of the pump. \n\n\n\n82 \n \n\nThe error associated with the differential pressure provided by the pump is calculated \n\naccording to the following equation: \n\n??'5 = \u00ac \u00c3?'\u00c3'??\u00c5\u00c6\u00c7\u00c8\u00c9\u00ca? ?'??\u00c5\u00c6\u00c7\u00c8\u00c9\u00ca? \u00ae\n5\n\n+ Z \u00c3?'\u00c3'\u00c5\u00cb\u00c6l?\u00cc? ?'\u00c5\u00cb\u00c6l?\u00cc? ^\n5\n           (A.3) \n\nwhere ??'  is the error of the differential pressure, ?'??\u00c5\u00c6\u00c7\u00c8\u00c9\u00ca?  is the error of the discharge \npressure and ?'\u00c5\u00cb\u00c6l?\u00cc?  is the error of the suction pressure. Therefore,  \n\n??' = \u00cd?'??\u00c5\u00c6\u00c7\u00c8\u00c9\u00ca?5 + ?'\u00c5\u00cb\u00c6l?\u00cc?5                     (A.4) \n \n\nA.3 \u2013 Combined error of the head coefficient \n\n \n\nAccording to Equation (6), the head coefficient is defined as: \n\nD+ = &amp;'(0????                  \nThe error associated with the head coefficient is calculated according to the following \n\nequation: \n\n???5 = Z\u00c3??\u00c3?' ??' ^\n5 + Z\u00c3??\u00c3( ?(^\n\n5 + Z\u00c3??\u00c30 ?0 ^\n5 + Z\u00c3??\u00c3?? ??? ^\n\n5\n               (A.5) \n\nwhere ???  is the error of the head coefficient, ?( is the error of the density, ?0  is the error \nof the speed and ???  is the error of \t5. Therefore: \n\n??? = \u00cd\nJ\u00ce'??\u00a7??\n??\u00ab(?03 +\n\n\u00ce'??\u00aa?\n??3(303 +\n\nJ\u00ce'??L?\n??3(?0\u00ab +\n\n?\u00cfN?\n??3(?03            (A.6) \n\n \n\nA.4 \u2013 Combined error of the flow coefficient \n\n \n\nAccording to the Equation (5), the flow coefficient is defined as: \n\nD* = A-\t5: \nThe error associated with the flow coefficient is calculated according to the following \n\nequation: \n\n???5 = Z\u00c3??\u00c3* ?* ^\n5 + Z\u00c3??\u00c30 ?0 ^\n\n5 + Z\u00c3??\u00c3?? ??? ^\n5\n             (A.7) \n\nwhere ???  is the error of the flow coefficient, ?*  is the error of the flow. Therefore: \n\n\n\n83 \n \n\n??? = \u00cd\nm*??\u00a7??\n\n??\u00d00? +\n???\n\n??\u00ab0? +\n*??L?\n??\u00ab03               (A.8) \n\n \n\nA.5 \u2013 Calculation of the combined errors \n\n \n\nAccording to the combined error definition, the errors associated with the flow and head \n\ncoefficients, D* and D+, calculated for test 17 and presented in Figure 22, are the following: \n \n\nTable A.1 \u2013 Variables and errors \n\nVariable Error Error type \n\n? \u00b1 0.4% Error type A \nP \u00b1 0.5% Error type B (Table 1) \n? \u00b1 0.3% Error type B (Table 1) \n\nD2 \u00b1 0.015% Error type B (Table 1) \nQ \u00b1 1.0% Error type B (Table 1) \n?P \u00b1 0.7% Combined error \nD+ \u00b1 1.4% Combined error \nD* \u00b1 7.9% Combined error \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n84 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n85 \n \n\nAPPENDIX B \u2013 Experimental data \n\nTest 1 2 3 4 5 \nPump type OH2 OH2 OH2 OH2 OH2 \n?
