Nano texturing can improve \n\nthe performance of Ta dental implant as it promotes faster osseointegration. Nano texturing \n\nchanges surface roughness which affects the tribological behavior.   \n\nAn electrochemical process called anodization was used to modify the surface \n\nof tantalum by introducing highly ordered nano pores on its surface. Anodization is a \n\nprocess that involves several parameters which can be easily modified to produce \n\ncontrolled surface texturing. The applied potential has a propotional relationship to pore \n\ndiameter and Ta2O5 film thickness. Higher applied potential leads to larger pore diameters \n\nand thicker oxide layer. For the purpose of this thesis, tantalum was anodized at three \n\ndifferent potentials, namely 15, 25 and 50 V. The purpose of this thesis was to test the \n\neffect of surface roughness induced by anodization, on the tribological properties of Ta, \n\nparticularly its static friction behavior. The surface roughness parameter used for this study \n\nwas the mean peak to valley height of profile (Rz). Reference samples used for comparison \n\nwere polished Ta metal and chemically etched Ta.  \n\nStructural analysis of the prepared Ta samples was performed by optical \n\nmicroscopy, surface morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy \n\n(SEM), the crystal structure was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), hardness was \n\nmeasured using Vickers hardness method and surface roughness measurements were made \n\nby a 3-D profilometer. Friction tests were performed using a standard tensile testing \n\nmachine with electronic control of cross head motion.  \n\nHighly ordered nano porous surface was formed by the anodization process. \n\nThe size of pores increased when higher anodization potentials were used. The anodization \n\nprocess caused a change in surface roughness. The relationship between surface roughness \n\nand the static friction coefficient was studied and it was found that static friction \n\ncoefficient showed a propotional relationship to surface roughness. Dynamic friction \n\ncoefficient did not show a clear relation to surface roughness. \n\nK keywords: Tantalum, anodization, nano-texturing, surface \n\nroughness, tribology, static friction. \n\n\n\n \n\n    \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\nvi  2016 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n  Resumo \n                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\nAyesha Khalid  vii \n\n \n\n \n\nRESUMO \n\nO T\u00e2ntalo (Ta) \u00e9 um elemento met\u00e1lico com excelentes propriedades no que \n\ndiz respeito a biocompatibilidade e bioatividade, demonstrando possuir um enorme \n\npotencial para ser usado em implantes odontol\u00f3gicos. A nano-texturiza\u00e7\u00e3o pode melhorar o \n\ndesempenho de implantes dent\u00e1rios promovendo um aumento por parte da integra\u00e7\u00e3o \n\n\u00f3ssea. No entanto, a altera\u00e7\u00e3o da rugosidade superficial atrav\u00e9s desta t\u00e9cnica de superf\u00edcie \n\npode afetar o seu comportamento tribol\u00f3gico. No presente trabalho, foi utilizado um \n\nprocesso eletroqu\u00edmico conhecido como anodiza\u00e7\u00e3o de forma a modificar a superf\u00edcie do \n\nTa atrav\u00e9s da introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de nano poros, altamente ordenados. A anodiza\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 um processo \n\nque envolve a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de v\u00e1rios par\u00e2metros que podem ser facilmente modificados, \n\npermitindo obter um maior controle sobre a texturiza\u00e7\u00e3o da superf\u00edcie do elemento. Existe \n\numa rela\u00e7\u00e3o diretamente proporcional entre o potencial aplicado (Volts-V) e o di\u00e2metro \n\ndos poros assim como a espessura dos filmes de Ta2O5. Quanto maior for o potencial \n\naplicado, maior ser\u00e1 o di\u00e2metro dos poros e mais espessa ser\u00e1 a camada de \u00f3xido formada \n\nsobre a superf\u00edcie de Ta. \n\nO presente trabalho tem como objetivo o estudo do efeito da altera\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nrugosidade na superf\u00edcie de Ta induzida por anodiza\u00e7\u00e3o, assim como, a influ\u00eancia sobre as \n\npropriedades tribol\u00f3gicas, em particular o seu comportamento \u00e0 fric\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1tica. Para que \n\neste estudo fosse poss\u00edvel foi realizada a an\u00e1lise estrutural e morfol\u00f3gica de amostras \n\nanodizadas a tr\u00eas potenciais diferentes: 15, 25 e 50 V.  \n\nA an\u00e1lise estrutural das amostras de Ta foi avaliada com recurso \u00e0 t\u00e9cnica de \n\ndifra\u00e7\u00e3o de raios-X (DRX), a morfologia da superf\u00edcie foi estudada por microscopia de \n\nvarrimento eletr\u00f3nico (SEM), a dureza classificada segundo a escala de Vickers e a \n\nrugosidade avaliada atrav\u00e9s de um perfil\u00f3metro 3-D. Os ensaios de desgaste foram \n\nrealizados utilizando uma m\u00e1quina de ensaios de tra\u00e7\u00e3o com controlo num\u00e9rico. Os \n\nresultados obtidos foram comparados com amostras de Ta sem qualquer tratamento \n\nsuperficial.  \n\nO processo de anodiza\u00e7\u00e3o permitiu obter superf\u00edcies nano porosas \n\nextremamente ordenadas. O tamanho das porosidades aumentou com o aumento do \n\npotencial de anodiza\u00e7\u00e3o. A utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do processo de anodiza\u00e7\u00e3o possibilitou uma \n\naltera\u00e7\u00e3o da rugosidade superficial. A rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre a rugosidade superficial e o coeficiente \n\nde atrito est\u00e1tico, foi comparada, verificando-se que o valor de coeficiente de atrito \u00e9 \n\n\n\n \n\nResumo \n                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n\n    \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\nviii  2016 \n\n \n\ndiretamente proporcional \u00e1 rugosidade superficial.

INTRODUCTION \n\nA dental implant is an artificially constructed tooth root which is integrated \n\nwith an artificially made tooth crown to replace missing teeth [1]. When the implant is \n\ninserted inside the jaw, a healing process takes place. The healing process is called \n\nosseointegration, which occurs when the bone cells surround the implant grow into a \n\nnetwork around the artificial prosthetic, hence holding it firmly in place. The growing bone \n\ncells are called osteoblasts. Their adhesion to the implant surface greatly depends on the \n\nimplant geometry and surface properties. Biocomplatibility is the most essential property \n\nrequired for dental implant materials. In this regards tantalum seems to be a good option. \n\nModification of surface properties of a dental implant has been given special \n\nfocus in terms of accelerating the healing process. Particularly surface roughness has been \n\nidentified as an important parameter in this respect [2]. Several surface texturing \n\ntechniques have been used in the past but each of them has certain drawbacks. Most \n\nimportantly, the techniques do not provide easy control of surface roughness. Anodization \n\nis an electrochemical technique that has been employed in the past for surface texturing. \n\nThe parameters involved in this technique can be easily controlled, hence giving the user to \n\nability to control the surface roughness. The technique can be used to achieve surface \n\nroughness values from the micron scale down to the nano scale.  \n\nThe tribological behavior of a textured dental implant surface plays a \n\nsignificant role in its performance. When a dental implant is inserted inside the jaw, ideally \n\nit should become anchored firmly with no motion. The efficiency of mechanical \n\ninterlocking between the textured surface and the surrounding bone decides the degree of \n\nthe anchorage. The mechanical interlocking also decides how much force would be \n\nrequired to slide the contacting surfaces against each other. In a dental implant sliding \n\nshould not exist. Therefore, the textured surface should have a surface roughness that \n\nenables it to efficiently interlock with the bone structure. In other words, its static friction \n\ncoefficient should be as high as possible. However, dental implants have shown to exhibit \n\nsome fretting motion. Fretting can lead to wear debris and loosely anchored dental implant. \n\nTherefore it is essential to study the tribological behavior of the material used for dental \n\nimplant in order to validate its suitability for the application. \n\nThe purpose of this master\u2019s thesis is to study the tribological behavior of \n\nmicro/nano anodized tantalum surface by anodization to be used as dental implant \n\n\n\n \n\nTribological Behavior of micro/nano structured tantalum surfaces by anodization method \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\n2  2016 \n\n \n\nmaterials. Tantalum surfaces with different nano pore sizes have been made by anodization \n\nand the tribological performance of these surfaces in contact with bone will be evaluated. \n\n1.1.  Objectives  \n\nThe aim of this master thesis research work is to measure and analyze the \n\ntribological behavior of micro/nano textured tantalum surfaces formed by anodization \n\nmethod. Anodization is an electrochemical technique that has been employed in the past \n\nfor surface texturing of materials for different applications. For dental implants, surface \n\ntexturing has been performed to accelerate the healing process. The anodization technique \n\ninvolves several parameters which can be easily controlled to modify the surface texture \n\nand to achieve highly ordered nanopores. For this thesis, the applied potential was varied \n\nwhile keeping all other parameters (time, electrolyte, current and temperature) constant. \n\nIncreasing the potential causes the pore diameter and the tantalum oxide layer thickness to \n\nincrease.  \n\nSurface morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscope \n\n(SEM), the crystal structure by X-ray diffraction (XRD), the surface roughness by 3-D \n\nprofilometry and hardness by vickers hardness test. The tribological characterization was \n\ndone by using a friction coefficient measurement device which was originally developed in \n\nCEMUC. The setup was operated by a standard tensile testing machine where the cross \n\nhead motion was controlled electronically. The wear marks were analyzed under an optical \n\nmicroscope. The friction tests were performed at both dry and wet conditions. For the wet \n\nconditions, the ageing effect of saliva was studied by immersing the samples in aritificial \n\nsaliva for 3 days, after which, friction tests were performed. \n\n1.2.

STATE OF THE ART \n\n2.1. Dental Implants \n\nTantalum is a high density, high strength and high hardness metal. It has been \n\nstudied in the past for its possible biomedical applications and it has shown to have good \n\nbiocompatibility and bioactivity [1], [2]. The factors that contribute to the high bioactivity \n\nin tantalum are its higher surface wettability and surface energy as compared to titanium \n\nwhich lacks bioactivity [25], therefore tantalum has potential application as dental implant.  \n\nA dental implant is an artificially constructed tooth root which is integrated \n\nwith artificially made tooth crown to replace missing teeth [1]. A dental implant is \n\ndesigned to match as closely as possible to the real tooth root. A comparison of natural \n\ntooth and a dental implant is given in Figure 2.1. \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.1. Tooth vs. Implant Comparison [5] \n\nIn this figure the different components of artificial tooth are given. The implant \n\nis in direct contact with the surrounding bone. When the implant is inserted inside the jaw, \n\na healing process takes place. The healing process is called osseointegration. The concept \n\nof osseointegration was first introduced by Br\u00e5nemark [3]. In his research paper he \n\nconcluded that the typical healing time for a dental implant is 3 to 6 months. Since the \n\nadvent of dental implants in 1965 [4], various methods of improving the performance of \n\nthe artificial prosthetic have been researched. Osseointegration occurs when the bone cells \n\n\n\n \n\n  Chapter 2 \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\nAyesha Khalid  5 \n\n \n\nsurround the implant grow into a network around the artificial prosthetic, hence holding it \n\nfirmly in place. The growing bone cells are called osteoblasts. Their adhesion to the \n\nimplant surface greatly depends on the implant geometry and surface properties. Titanium \n\nis a popular material used to make dental implant due to its excellent corrosion resistance, \n\nhigh strength and excellent biocomplatibility. Titanium forms an oxide upon exposure to \n\nair. The oxide layer is biocompatible and bioinert . Hence bone cells are not easily bonded \n\nwith its surface, resulting in the formation of a fibrous tissue layer which subsequently \n\nseparates the metal surface from the cells. Tantalum is another biocompatible material \n\nwhich forms a bioactive oxide layer on its surface and thus has exhibited a behavior much \n\ncloser to real bone behavior than titanium [25]. Therefore this research has focused on \n\ntantalum as a dental implant material because tantalum holds the promise of a faster and \n\nmore effective healing process. \n\n2.2.  Surface modification of dental implant \n\nModification of surface properties has been given special focus in terms of \n\nimproved biocompatibility of dental implant material. Particularly surface roughness has \n\nbeen identified as an important parameter in the acceleration of healing process [2]. A \n\nresearch study was conducted by Albrektsson &amp; Wennerberg [7] on the effect of surface \n\nroughness on dental implant performance. They focused their research on four most \n\ncommonly used commercially available dental implants. They categorized dental implants \n\naccording to their surface roughness values as: smooth (Sa &lt;0.5 \u00b5m), minimally rough (Sa \n\n= 0.5-1.0 \u00b5m), moderately rough (Sa = 1.0-2.0 \u00b5m) and rough (Sa > 2.0 \u00b5m) [2]. The \n\nresearchers also introduced a new surface roughness parameter, developed surface area \n\nratio (Sdr) which takes into account the density of peaks (Sds) and surface roughness (Sa). \n\nHence it is a hybrid parameter used to estimate the heights and peaks of a surface [2]. \n\nSurface roughness can be divided into three levels based on scale [8]: macro, micro and \n\nnano scaled roughness. \n\nSeveral surface modification techniques have been used in the past. The most \n\ncommonly used surface modification techniques are: sand blasting (mechanical method), \n\nacid etching (chemical method), plasma spraying (coating method), laser modification and \n\nanodization (electrochemical method) [8].  \n\nSand blasting is a process by which the surface is impinged by particles, \n\ncreating grooves and craters. This way the surface roughness is increased.

They were able to conclude that the surface roughness \n\ndepends on the size, speed, density and shape of the impinging particle. The impinging \n\nparticles used were titanium oxide and aluminum oxide. A drawback of sand blasting is \n\nthat sometimes the particles can become buried in the surface. Typical surface roughness \n\nvalues obtained from this method are 0.5 \u2013 2.0 \u00b5m [2]. \n\nAcid etching is a technique by which an acid is used to pit the surface, \n\nselectively removing some grains and grain boundaries. A surface can be made of different \n\nphases. Compositional differences result in different sensitivity to acid etching. Hence, \n\nsome phases are more easily removed than others, resulting in increased surface roughness \n\nby pitting. The surface roughness depends on the type of acid used, soaking time and \n\nmaterial surface composition. Typical surface roughness values obtained from acid etching \n\nare 0.3 \u2013 1.0 \u00b5m [2].  \n\nCoating methods such as plasma spraying have been used in the past as well. \n\nGroot et. al. researched the possibility of improving the biocompatibility of titanium \n\nimplants by coating the surface with hydroxyapatite [11]. Their reason for using this \n\nparticular coating is its close match with bone. Past research has shown that the coating \n\neffectively increases osseointegration, However, the coatings have weak adhesion on the \n\nmetal surface. They can dissolve when the implant is inserted or develop long term failure \n\n[12].  \n\n2.2.1. Anodization  \n\nBone cells (osteoblasts) have been shown to exhibit greater adhesion to nano-\n\ntextured titanium than to conventional titanium [12]-[14]. Hence, nanotexturing has shown \n\nto improve the osseointegration process. Anodization is an electrochemical technique that \n\nhas been employed in the past for surface texturing of materials for different applications. \n\nIn the medical sector, anodization has been used to modify the surface properties of \n\nimplants. The anodization process consists of three major steps as given in literature [12]: \n\nalkaline cleaning, acid activation and electrolyte anodizing. The anodization is an \n\nelectrochemical process which is carried out in a typical three electrode cell: Sample \n\nanode, platinum cathode and Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The two electrode cell can also \n\nbe used. The technique can be used in two modes: constant potential and constant current. \n\nAnodization has been used for inducing micro and nanopores on tantalum oxide surface, in \n\n\n\n \n\n  Chapter 2 \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\nAyesha Khalid  7 \n\n \n\npast research. The electrochemical reactions and ions diffusion that take places during the \n\nprocess lead to the formation of an oxide on the anode.  \n\nThe earliest studies on anodization involved high voltage anodization (ASD). \n\nThe mechanism behind surface texturing by this method can be explained by the avalanche \n\ntheory [12]. When an oxide film forms it acts as a dielectric barrier to current flow. As the \n\npotential is increase, the film continues to grow until the dielectric breakdown limit is \n\nreached. At this point, the weaker regions of the heterogenous oxide film undergo thermal \n\nstressing and subsequent breakdown. The exposed metal below the oxide starts forming an \n\noxide layer again. Therefore the process involves a balance between the growth and \n\nbreakdown of the oxide film. The balance is dependent on the processing parameters given \n\nabove, especially the type of electrolyte chosen for the technique plays a major role. Figure \n\n2.2 shows the anodization process: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.2.

They observed that acidic electrolytes produced thicker films than \n\n\n\n \n\nTribological Behavior of micro/nano structured tantalum surfaces by anodization method \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\n8  2016 \n\n \n\nalkaline electrolytes. A number of researchers have studied the formation of TiO2 \n\nnanotubes on oxide thin film by anodization. \n\nIn 1980, Baun was able to form nanoporous TiO2 by anodization in chromic \n\nacid at 10-40 V [17].  Since then, a number of researchers have found that presence of \n\nhydrogen fluoride (HF) in electrolyte leads to formation of nanoporous structures TiO2 at \n\nrelatively lower voltages [18]-[22].  \n\nThe effect of using different potential values in HF solution was studied by \n\nGong et. al. [[23]] and they found that as potential is increased, the pore size increases but \n\nthe final length of the nanotubes was independent of pore size [23].  \n\nThe pH of the electrolyte bath affects the ability of oxide to reform after \n\nbreaking and the ability of electrolyte to dissolve the oxide [24]. Cai et. al. [25] studied the \n\neffect of electrolyte pH on the growth of nanotubes on titanium oxide surface. They \n\nobserved that increasing the pH increases the time required for nanotube formation. Longer \n\nnanotubes could be obtained at higher pH [25]. Hence the nanotube length can be \n\ncontrolled by controlling the pH. The anodization time influences the nanotube wall \n\nthickness but does not affect the tube diameter. With an increase in time the tube wall \n\nthickness increases [24]. \n\nThe pore wall thickness can be varied by changing the electrolyte bath \n\ntemperature. This relationship was studied by Mor GK et. al. [26].  They found out that \n\nvarying the temperature varied the process of electrochemical etching and chemical \n\ndissolution. They performed their experiments at a constant potential of 10 V and two \n\ndifferent temperatures: 5 ?C and 50 ?C. The pore diameter is both cases was the same but \n\nthe average pore wall thickness at 5 ?C was 34 nm and at 50 ?C it was 9 nm.  \n\nBiological studies have shown a high healing rate in anodized nanoporous TiO2 \n\ndental implant. This is due to the increased adhesion, attachment and growth of the \n\nosteoblasts on the bone-mimicking nanoporous surface. The osteoblasts have also shown to \n\nhave a different morphology on anodized surface than on unanodized titanium. They show \n\ngreater spreading on the surface of anodized titanium whereas they appear more rounded \n\non unanodized titanium [13]. The nanotubular structure also promoted much higher \n\ncalcium deposition by osteoblasts than the low roughness surface.  \n\nIn the extensive study and research on the application of titanium as a \n\nbiocompatible material, it has been discovered that even though titanium oxide has \n\nexcellent biocompatibility, it lacks sufficient osseointegration for implant longetivity [27]. \n\n\n\n \n\n  Chapter 2 \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\nAyesha Khalid  9 \n\n \n\nAs discussed in chapter 2.2, surface modification of dental implant, different surface \n\ntexturing methods have been used to promote bioactivity in titanium surface by improving \n\nits adhesion and mechanically interlocking with bioactive coatings. Titanium oxide \n\nsurfaces need to be coated with a more bioactive hydroxyapatite to improve their \n\nosseointegration performance. But ceramic porous coatings carry the risks of delamination, \n\ncracking and low fracture toughness [27]. A bioactive material should not require any \n\ncoatings; its own surface should encourage bone growth [28]. Tantalum has come into the \n\nspotlight as a material with good bioactivity, high mechanical strength and excellent \n\nfatigue resistance [28]. The only reason its application in the medical field has been limited \n\nis the processing problems associated with the metal. Tantalum is an expensive material \n\nwith a high melting point and high affinity to oxygen. This has posed as an obstacle in \n\nmanufacturing of a fully dense tantalum implant. In 2010, Balla et. al. [27] performed laser \n\ncoating of tantalum on titanium for bone replacement structures. Their study found that Ta \n\ncoated implant showed enhanced cell attachment and proliferation as compared to titanium \n\noxide surface. The enhanced osseointegration was attributed to the superior wettability and \n\nhigh surface energy of Ta surface [27]. Jafari et. al. [29] compared the performance of \n\nporous tantalum hip cup and hydroxyapatite coated titanium hip cup. Their aim was the \n\ncompare the bioactivity of both materials. Ta hip cup exhibited superior performance than \n\nHA coated Ti cup. They concluded that Ta has clear potential for bone ingrowth whereas \n\nTi surface has potential for bone ongrowths. It requires an assistive bioactive coating such \n\nas HA, hence it is not a true bone ingrowth surface (lacks bioactivity) [29].  \n\nThe anodization of tantalum oxide films, both amorphous and crystalline has \n\nbeen given special focus. The growth of dense oxide on tantalum in dilute phosphoric acid \n\nelectrolyte was studied by Lu et. al. in 2002 [30]. The growth of porous Ta2O5 films in \n\nmixed H2SO4/HF electrolyte was studied by Sieber et. al.  [31]. It was found that the nearly \n\nuniform porous oxide can be achieved with pore diameter ranging from 2 to 10 nm. The \n\nmorphology and thickness of the layer depends on applied potential, anodization time and \n\nthe concentration of HF [31]. Anodization of tantalum has also been performed in non-\n\naqueous electrolytes consisting of glycerol with small quantities of NH4 [32]. It was found \n\nthat porous layers of thickness up to 15 \u00b5m and pore diameters in the range of 10-40 nm \n\ncan be achieved by optimizing the electrochemical conditions [32]. This study also \n\nconfirmed the strong effect of fluoride concentration and applied potential on the \n\nmorphology of the layers. Allama et. al. [33] studied the effect of using different \n\nconcentrations of HF and H2SO4. In addition they also studied the effect of adding small \n\n\n\n \n\nTribological Behavior of micro/nano structured tantalum surfaces by anodization method \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\n10  2016 \n\n \n\namounts of different additives such as H3PO4, ethylene glycol and dimethyl sulfoxide. \n\nThey observed that pore diameter increases with increasing concentration of HF. Addition \n\nof H3PO4 resulted in growth of higher lengths of nanorods (1300 nm) and the other \n\nadditives enabled fabrication of high aspect-ratio vertically oriented tantalum oxide \n\nnanotube array films [33]. \n\nHence the same principals of controlling anodization parameters for texturing \n\ntitanium can also be applied for tantalum oxide surface, making its processing an \n\neconomical and simple task.  \n\nAnodic oxidation of tantalum can be used to produce controlled surface \n\nporosity at the micro and nano scale. It has proven to be a simple, efficient technique for \n\nsurface texturing of dental implants. Anodized surfaces have shown to have higher \n\nbiocompatibility and lead to better adhesion and network formation from osteoblasts. Since \n\ntantalum has excellent biocompatibility, its nanoporous oxide surface can potentially lead \n\nto shorter healing time.  \n\n2.3.  Dental implant/Bone interface: Tribological Problems \n\nThe design of a dental implant may be improved and optimized to match as \n\nclosely as possible to the real tooth but there will still be some differences. The mechanical \n\ninterlocking between a dental implant surface and the surrounding bone is not as strong as \n\nthe real biological surfaces of tooth and bone.  \n\nIn chapter 2.2 the importance of surface texturing was discussed.  Texturing of \n\nthe implant surface is performed to provide it with a surface structure that will fit into the \n\nnano-porous structure of the bone. The two surfaces can ideally be thought of as having \n\ncomplimenting jigsaw pattern, although the mechanical interlocking would not be as \n\nperfect as a jigsaw. This interlocking provides the initial mechanical anchorage to the \n\nimplant/bone interface while the bone grows around the implant. Friction plays a major \n\nrole in the initial stability of immediately loaded dental implants [34].  It results from the \n\nmechanical interlocking of implant and bone surfaces. Good mechanical interlocking \n\nmeans that under loaded conditions the interface should undergo minor elastic \n\ndeformations but no slippage, as slippage will lead to micro-motions which result in \n\nproblems as will be explained further. Keeping this mechanical interlocking phenomenon \n\nin mind, researchers have been improving the surface properties of dental implants. In \n\n\n\n \n\n  Chapter 2 \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\nAyesha Khalid  11 \n\n \n\n1972, Predcki et. al. studied the effect of threaded implants as compared to smooth \n\nimplants, on the attachment of bone [35]. They found that the threaded implants showed \n\ngreater bone growth due to better mechanical interlocking and osseointegration. \n\nResearchers also developed porous coatings in order to improve friction properties of the \n\nimplant [36]. The idea was that the increased surface roughness will improve implant \n\nfixation. But studies have found that only a small percentage of pore volume is actually \n\nfilled with bone [37]-[39]. In 2012, Hasan et. al. researched an experimental approach to \n\ndetermine the friction coefficient of implant-antler interface [34]. The antler is similar in \n\nnature to human bone; hence the static and kinetic friction coefficients were measured. The \n\nstatic friction coefficient values came to be in the range of 0.5-0.7 and increasing sliding \n\nvelocity decreased the friction coefficient [34]. A finite element method was also \n\ndeveloped by Bulaqi et. al [40]  to study the effect of coefficient of friction on the preload \n\ninduced at the implant/bone interface and other interfaces of implant system. They were \n\nable to conclude that coefficient of friction plays the most important role in implant screw \n\nloosening [40].  \n\nIn reality the implant\u2019s surface does not interlock with the bone surface quite as \n\nefficiently as desired. This causes some micro-motion to occur between the implant and \n\nbone and the knowledge of the implications of this micro-motion on the performance of the \n\ndental implant is important. tribological implications. The following paragraphs explain the \n\nstate of the art of the micro-motion problems that exist in dental implants.  \n\nIn the earliest studies on the application of titanium dental implants, the \n\nexistence of some small degree of motion between the implant and bone was pointed out \n\nby Carlsson et. al.[41]. This small degree of motion is called fretting. Fretting is the \n\ntribological motion between two contacting surfaces under loaded condition, where the \n\namplitude of the movement is less than 100 \u00b5m [42]. The dental implant/bone interface \n\nundergoes fretting wear due to the chewing motion of the mouth. The motion turns the \n\ndental implant/bone interface into a special tribological pair undergoing different stresses \n\n(tension, compression, shear) resulting in complex fretting and ultimately failure [1].  It is \n\nespecially a prominent problem during the early stages of osseointegration. After insertion \n\nof the dental implant, the healing process takes a few months. In the primary healing phase \n\nthe fretting motion is highest as the surrounding bone has not fully attached itself to the \n\nimplant. The fretting behavior of titanium implants/cortical bone interface was studied by \n\nYu et. al. in 2005 [43]. \n\n\n\n \n\nTribological Behavior of micro/nano structured tantalum surfaces by anodization method \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\n12  2016 \n\n \n\nIn a bio-tribological system, fretting will not just lead to production of wear \n\ndebris and surface damage. One of the contacting surfaces is the bone which is a living \n\ntissue. It grows with time around the implant. The bio-response of the bone and the process \n\nof osseointegration are also affected due to fretting motion. Fretting in dental implant/bone \n\ninterface can be divided into three types which are also illustrated in Figure 2.3 [44]: \n\n1. tangential fretting \n\n2. radial fretting \n\n3. dual-motion fretting \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3. Fretting modes existed in the dental implant/bone interface [44] \n\n \n\nYu et. al. in their research on fretting of titanium implants as mentioned before, \n\nstudied the tagential mode of fretting. They performed their experiments in-vitro by \n\nemploying a titanium ball on bone flat geometry on a reciprocating tribometer modified for \n\nfretting. They were able to conclude that tagential fretting occurs due to delamination and \n\nabrasive wear [43].  \n\nIn 2008, Yu HY et. al. studied the radial fretting behavior of cortical bone/ \n\ntitanium implant interface [45]. Radial fretting behaves quite differently from tagential \n\nfretting due to the different direction of loading. The researchers concluded from their \n\nstudy that radial fretting results in four types of cracks. The most common were along the \n\ncement line due to the deficiency of calcium and phosphate along those lines. \u2018The second \n\ncracks initiate from or end at the Havers's canal. The third ones are cracks connecting two \n\nconsecutive Havers's canals if the stress is big enough. Each Harvers's system is a relative \n\nindependent structure, but it will release the stress energy to adjacent Harvers's system if it \n\ncould not use out the high stress brought from cracks alone. The fourth type is that kind of \n\ncracks propagating at interstitial lamella linearly\u2019 [45]. The four types of cracks are given \n\nin Figure 2.4 [44]: \n\n\n\n \n\n  Chapter 2 \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\nAyesha Khalid  13 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.4. Four kind of cracks in radial fretting test [44]. \n\nSince the implant/bone interface is loaded under different forms of stresses due \n\nto the masticatory movement, fretting at the interface cannot so simply be defined as \n\npurely tangential or radial. In fact, dual motion fretting occurs more commonly than either \n\nof the latter two. Keeping this in mind, Yu HY et. al. expanded their research in 2009 and \n\nstudied the dual motion fretting behavior of titanium implant/bone interface [46]. They \n\nfound that at low loads, the main wear mechanisms of dual motion fretting were adhesive \n\nand abrasive wear. At higher loads the main wear mechanisms were a combination of \n\nadhesive wear, abrasive wear, cracking and lubrication of human bone tissue debris [46].  \n\nThe comparison between radial fretting and dual motion fretting of cortical \n\nbone was made by Gao et. al. in 2010 [47]. They found that dual motion fretting produced \n\nmore damage and more wear debris than radial fretting. Radial fretting produced \n\nsignificantly more cracks than dual motion fretting and the abundance of cracks was \n\ndependant on the bone microstructure. Radial fretting could thus be used to study the crack \n\npropagation of bone [47]. \n\nThe bio-response of bone to the micro-motion in vivo has also been studied in \n\nthe past. In the earliest researches concluded that micro-motion inhibited bone ingrowth \n\ninto implant and led to the formation of a fibrous membrane between the implant/bone \n\ninterface. The anchorage of bone to implant was therefore compromised [48] [49].  \n\nIn 1973, Cameron et. al. presented the idea of a threshold micro motion [50]. \n\nThey suggested that fibrous membrane does not form at interface upto a certain value of \n\nmicro-motion amplitude.  \n\nIn 1986, Pillar et. al. confirmed the existence of the threshold micro-motion. \n\nTheir research led to the conclusion that micro motion values of 150 \u00b5m to 500 \u00b5m could \n\nlead to damage and membrane formation [51].  \n\nIn 1993, Brunski detailed his ideas on the problems of overloading and micro-\n\nmotion on dental implant/bone interface [52]. He suggested that \u201cbased on evidence so far, \n\nas a rule of thumb: relative motion of more than 100 microns should be avoided\u201d. He also \n\nsuggested that the threshold micro-motion cannot be fixed because it depends on the \n\nimplant system.  \n\n\n\n \n\nTribological Behavior of micro/nano structured tantalum surfaces by anodization method \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\n14  2016 \n\n \n\nIn 2003, Gapski et. al. reviewed the effect of immediate implant loading [53]. \n\nHe agreed with the past concepts of threshold micro-motion and Brunsk\u2019s \u201crule of thumb\u201d. \n\nBased on these, they differentiated two different kinds of micro-motions: tolerable and \n\ndeleterious. They concluded that primary implant stability is the most important factor \n\naffecting immediate implant loading [53]. \n\nIt can be concluded that tribological properties of a dental implant material \n\nplay an important role in its performance and the tribological problems that can occur \n\nwhen a dental implant is integrated into the biological system need to be analyzed and \n\nsolved before deeming a material suitable for this particular application.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n  Chapter 3 \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\nAyesha Khalid  15 \n\n \n\n \n\n3. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE \n\n3.1. Materials and methods \n\nThe materials used for tribological test were tantalum samples and artificial \n\nbone material (epoxy resin reinforced by glass fibers). The preparation of these materials \n\nhas been described in sub chapters of this topic (3.1.1 &amp; 3.1.2). \n\n3.1.1. Tantalum sample preparation \n\nTantalum sheets (T1-9000-D73), of purity 99.95% and thickness of 0.5 mm, \n\nwere obtained from the supplier Testbourne. Tantalum samples were prepared by cutting \n\nthe sheets to dimensions of 20 x 25 mm with a cutting machine. The burrs formed on the \n\nedge of the samples, from cutting the metal sheet, were removed by using grinding paper \n\nof grit size 320. In order to prepare the sample surface for anodization, both sides of the \n\nsamples were polished on grinding papers of grit size size 250, 320, 500, 800, 1200 and \n\n2000, 2500 and 4000. Six conditions were defined for the treatment of the samples and \n\nthese are summarized in Table 3.1. \n\n \n\nTable 3.1. Treatment conditions of tantalum samples \n\n \n\nNo. Treatment \n\n1 Polished (reference) \n\n2 Polished and Anodized at potential of 15 V in H2SO4:HF (9:1) \n3 Polished and Etched in HNO3:HF (1:1) solution (reference) \n\n4 Etched and Anodized at 15 V in H2SO4:HF (9:1) \n\n5 Etched and Anodized at 25 V in H2SO4:HF (9:1) \n\n6 Etched and Anodized at 50 V in H2SO4:HF (9:1) \n\n \n\nAs Table 3.1 shows, two samples were used as reference. They differed in \n\nterms of their surface preparation i.e. mechanical polishing and chemical etching. The Ta \n\nsheets supplied had poor surface quality hence etching was employed to remove scratchs \n\nand irregularities from the surface. But since etching introduces pitting at the micron level \n\non the metal surface, the effect of this micro porosity on the friction of the textured surface \n\nwas also studied. Hence the mechanically polished sample was required for comparison in \n\nthis case. The samples were etched in an acid solution consisting of nitric acid and \n\nhydrofluoric acid (1:1) for two minutes. Extreme care needed to be taken during the \n\n\n\n \n\nTribological Behavior of micro/nano structured tantalum surfaces by anodization method \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\n16  2016 \n\n \n\netching process due to the use of highly corrosive liquids. The samples immersed in the \n\nsolution were carefully stirred after every 30 seconds in order to ensure uniform etching. \n\nAfter etching treatment the samples were washed with distilled water and air dried. \n\nThe samples underwent two-sided anodization as the schematic of the \n\nelectrochemical setup show in Figure 3.1. As the name suggests, two-sided anodization \n\ncauses both sides of a sample to be textured. This setup was designed at University of \n\nMinho by Professor Sandra Carvalho. The electrolyte solution used for anodization \n\nconsisted of H2SO4 and HF in the ratio 9:1. The voltage was supplied by an electronic \n\nvoltage source.The test was performed at galvanostatic conditions. The samples were fixed \n\non a metallic sample holder and care was taken to immerse the samples only half way in, \n\nso as to avoid contact between the sample holder and the strong electrolyte as this could \n\naffect the anodization process. As soon as the sample was immersed in the electrolyte \n\nsolution, the voltage source was turned on. During the experiment the electrolyte was \n\nconstantly stirred by a magnetic stirrer in order to ensure uniform texturing on the sample \n\nsurface. The electrochemical process ran for two minutes, after which the voltage source \n\nwas turned off. The sample was removed and washed with distilled water to remove \n\nresidue acid. A few nanotubes of Ta2O5 usually form during anodization and when the \n\nobjective is to obtain nanopores, these need to be removed. Hence, the anodized sample \n\nwas placed in another small beaker filled with distilled water and ultrasonic cleaning was \n\nperformed for 15 minutes in order to remove the nanotubes. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 3.1.

Increasing the potential increases the pore size [23] \n\nas stated earlier in the state of the art. It should also be noted that increasing the voltage \n\nalso increases the oxide film thickness [55]. Hence, the samples anodized at 50 V had a \n\nthicker oxide layer with a distinct grey-green color. Tantalum oxide tends to exhibit \n\ndifferent colors depending on the applied voltage, and at around 50 V the oxide film \n\nusually exhibits a grey-green colour [56]. This phenomena was not observed on the surface \n\nof the samples anodized at 15 V and 25 V. The surface of the different samples was \n\nanalyzed under an optical microscope and the results have been discussed in Chapter 4.1. \n\n3.1.2. Bone material \n\nThe artificial bone material that was used for friction tests was a composite of \n\nepoxy resin reinforced with glass fibers, as it had mechanical properties most closely \n\nresembling cortical bone. The artificial bone material was supplied by Sawbones. The \n\ncomposite was prepared for thr friction test by cutting it into a cylinder which had a \n\ndiameter of 8 mm and a thickness of 2 mm. The composite samples were then glued to \n\nsolid steel cylinders that had been prepared to fit into the sample holders of the friction test \n\nequipment. Figure 3.2 shows a prepared artificial bone sample and the placement of the \n\nsamples in the friction testing machine. \n\n \n\n    \n\n \nFigure 3.2.

Characterization Techniques \n\nThe prepared tantalum samples were characterized by various techniques. The \n\nsurface of the samples was inspected under an optical microscope and images were \n\ncaptured with a camera attached to the microscope (Canon A620). \n\nField Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (Zeiss Merlin Gemini 2) was \n\nused to observe the morphology of the sample surfaces in order to compare the textured \n\nsurfaces with polished and etched surfaces, to measure the pore size of nano pores formed \n\non the surface of samples anodized at different potentials and to determine the uniformity \n\nof nano-texturing obtained on the sample surface after anodization treatment.  \n\nX-ray Diffraction (PANalytical X\u2019Pert PRO) was used to analyze the \n\ncrystallographic structure of the etched and anodized tantalum samples. Bragg-Brentano \n\nX-ray diffraction was performed in conventional (?-2?) mode (scan range 20? &lt;2? &lt;85?, \n\nstep size 2?= 0.04?, scan step time 3 seconds and Cu K?1 radiations (? = 1.54060 \u00c5). \n\nHardness measurements were made by using the Vickers hardness method \n\n(Struess Duramin) in order to determine change in hardness due to developed of oxide \n\nlayer of different thickness. Hardness tests were performed with a diamond shaped \n\nindenter at two different, 25 and 100 g.  \n\nThe surface roughness of tantalum samples was measured using a 3-D \n\nprofilometry (alicona INFINITE FOCUS) in order to determine changes in the surface \n\nroughness after etching and anodization treatment. The roughness measurements were also \n\nperformed on samples that have been kept in saliva at 37 ?C for three days. \n\nThe tribological characterization was done by using a friction coefficient \n\nmeasurement device which was originally developed in CEMUC. An image of the setup \n\nand the schematics are shown in Figure 3.2. The setup was operated by a standard tensile \n\ntesting machine with electronic control of cross-head motion [54].  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n  Chapter 3 \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\nAyesha Khalid  19 \n\n \n\n \n  \n\nFigure 3.3. (a)The friction coefficient measurement setup and (b) schematics of the friction test \n\n \n\nAs the schematics in Figure 3.3 show, the tantalum sample was placed in the \n\nsample holder in the center and the cortical bone mimicking composite, epoxy resin \n\nreinforced with glass fiber, was fixed into holders located on opposite side of the sample, \n\nand brought into contact with the tantalum metal surface. The so called \u2018sandwich\u2019 was \n\nclamped together firmly and a normal force (F) of 250 N was applied. In all experiments \n\nthe samples were displaced at a contant speed of 1 mm/min in the vertical direction. The \n\nresulting force vs. displacement relationship was plotted. The experiment was stopped \n\nwhen the plot achieved steady state. The plot was used to obtain three parameters: contact \n\nrigidity, static friction force and dynamic friction force . The slope of the initial linear part \n\nof the plot represented the rigidity of the interfacial contact, the maximum force \n\nrepresented the force required to initiate sliding. This force is used to calculate the static \n\nfriction coefficient which will be discussed in the chapter: results and discussion. After the \n\nmaximum force was reached the plot showed a decrease in force, until a constant force is \n\nreached. This was represented by a steady state on the plot. The constant force represented \n\nthe dynamic force i.e. the amount of force required to slide the sample after the sample \n\nsurface had overcome the static friction. This parameter was used to calculate the dynamic \n\nfriction coefficient. These three parameters were compared for samples treated at different \n\nconditions in order to obtain information regarding their friction properties. The friction \n\ntests were conducted at room temperature in both dry and wet conditions. For the wet \n\ncondition, the samples were immersed in artificial saliva and placed in an isothermal bath \n\nwhich was kept at a constant temperature of 37 ?C. The samples were kept in artificial \n\nsaliva for three days in order to analyze the ageing effect of saliva on the friction results.  \n\n(a) \n\n \n (a) \n\n(b) \n\n \n (a) \n\n\n\n \n\nTribological Behavior of micro/nano structured tantalum surfaces by anodization method \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\n20  2016 \n\n \n\nThe artificial saliva solution used in the experiments was prepared by using the \n\nguidelines given in a publication by Darvell [57].

Contact angle measurements were made with the \n\ninstrument dataphysics Contact Angle System OCA. The droplet volume was 9 \u00b5l and the \n\nliquid used for comparison was water AS.

Anodization treatment at a potential of 15 and 25 V, after etching, caused a reduction \n\nof the micro-pits and smoothened out the surface more, as can be observed in Figure 4.1(d) \n\n&amp; (e).

Figure 4.2 (a) shows the tantalum surface of polished and of \n\npolished and etched surfaces at 50,000 X magnification. In both cases texturing at the nano \n\nlevel was not observed. The figure shows that the surface is featureless in the un-anodized \n\nsample surfaces. The surface of the tantalum sample which was polished and anodized at a \n\npotential of 15V shows ordered porosity on the surface, with the average pore size of 25 \n\nnm. The supplied tantalum sheets had poor surface quality and surface preparation by \n\nmechanical polishing did not seem adequate as evident from the uneven surface in the \n\nimage, Figure 4.2 (b).  In order to overcome this problem and improve the surface \n\ncondition, etching was also performed prior to anodization. Figure 4.2 (c) shows the SEM \n\nimage of the tantalum sample etched and anodized at 15V. The surface shows highly \n\nordered nano-porosity with an average pore size of 25 nm. The difference in the etched \n\nsurface and the un-etched surface can be observed from the images. Etching the sample \n\nsuccessfully decreased the irregularities on the surface and improved surface quality. \n\nFigure 4.2 (d) shows the surface of sample etched and anodized at a potential of 25 V. The \n\nincreases in pore size can be observed from the image. This treatment resulted in an \n\naverage pore size of 45 nm.  \n\nFigure 4.2 (e) shows the surface of the sample etched and anodized at a \n\npotential of 50 V. The high voltage resulted in an increase in Ta2O5 oxide layer thickness. \n\nThe growth of the oxide layer was not uniform, as evident from the irregular topography of \n\nthe surface from Figure 4.2 (f). The pore size increased and the shape of the pores became \n\nirregular. The average pore size achieved after this treatment was 65 nm.  \n\nEDS (Energy-dispersive  X-ray spectroscopy) analysis was also performed in \n\norder to obtain information about elements present on the anodized surfaces.

Crystal Structure \n\nThe X-ray diffraction patterns obtained for tantalum samples treated at \n\ndifferent conditions are shown in Figure 4.3. All the samples, with the exception of the \n\nsamples anodized at 50 V, exhibit diffraction peak positions that are associated with BCC \n\nstructured alpha phase Tantalum metal (ICDD card no: 00-004-0788). However, the xrd \n\npatterns of the etched and anodized samples showed a difference in peak intensities. \n\nThe XRD pattern associated with the polished Ta sample (Figure 4.3(a)) was in \n\nagreement with the reference xrd pattern (ICDD card no: 00-004-0788). However, the \n\nXRD pattern of the sample that was anodized at a potential of 15 V and the etched Ta \n\nsample (Figure 4.3(b)&amp;(c)) showed a significant decrease in intensity of the peak \n\nassociated with (110) plane and an increase in the intensity of the peaks associated with the \n\n(200) and (211) planes. A possible explanation for this is preferential etching of the (110) \n\nplane which caused its intensity to decrease and since the other planes were now present in \n\n(a) (b) \n\n(c) (d) (e) \n\n\n\n \n\nTribological Behavior of micro/nano structured tantalum surfaces by anodization method \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\n24  2016 \n\n \n\nlarger quantity in the xrd analysis region, their xrd intensities became higher. The \n\nphenomena of differential etching has been observed before and it is caused due to a \n\ndifference in the packing density and orientation of different planes [58]. The electrolyte \n\ncomposition used for this anodization process was used before in a research study and the \n\nphenomenon of differential etching as a function of crystallographic orientation of \n\ntantalum grains was reported [59]. \n\nPerforming the anodization process after etching seemed to have led to \n\npreferential etching of the (110) and (200) planes, as indicated from the decrease in their \n\nrespective intensities observed from Figure 4.3(d). Furthermore, increasing the anodization \n\nvoltage caused an overall decrease in the intensity of the peaks associated with ?-Ta as \n\ndeduced from Figure 4.3 (e). This is a result of a greater contribution by the Ta2O5 film as \n\nits thickness increased. This oxide film is generally known to be amorphous [60] [61]. The \n\nincrease in oxide film thickness occurred due to anodization at a higher potential.  Hence, \n\nthe distance between the xrd rays and the ?-Ta surface increased, causing most of the x-\n\nrays to be absorbed by the amorphous oxide layer, leading to a decrease in ?-Ta peaks \n\nintensities. The XRD pattern associated with the sample anodized at 50V did not have the \n\npeaks associated with ?-Ta, which indicates a lack of long range crystallinity. Hence, it \n\ncould be deduced that the thickness of the oxide layer had increased to the point that the \n\nXRD pattern observed is predominantly contributed by the Ta2O5 film.   \n\n20 30 40 50 60 70 80\n\n(a) P o l i s h e d\n\n(b) P - A n - 1 5 V\n\n(c) E t c h e d\n\nI \nn\n t\n e\n\n n\n s\n\n i \nt \ny \n\n( \na\n.u\n\n )\n\n(d) E - A n - 1 5 V\n\n(e) E - A n - 2 5 V\n\n????\n?\n\nT a ( 1 1 0 )\nT a ( 2 0 0 ) T a ( 2 1 1 )\n\n(f) E - A n - 5 0 V\n\n \n \n\nFigure 4.3.

Hardness \n\nTable 4.1 shows Vickers hardness measurements, of Ta samples, obtained at \n\ntwo different indenter loads. The hardness value of polished sample, measured using the \n\nsmaller indentation load, was 224 HV. However when a higher load was used, the hardness \n\nvalue measured was smaller and closer to the values obtained for all the other samples. The \n\nreason for a higher hardness obtained at lower indentation load is that mechanical \n\npolishing may have led to surface hardening due to the plastic deformations that occurred \n\non the surface during the treatment. When higher indentation load of 100 g was used, the \n\nindentation depth increased and crossed through the hardened surface. Hence the hardness \n\nvalue measured at higher indentation load was of the un-deformed Ta surface.  \n\nAll other Ta samples, with the exception of the one anodized at 50 V, showed \n\nsimilar hardness values at both high and low indentation loads. The oxide layer on samples \n\nanodized at 15 and 25 V was penetrated by the indenter and the final hardness \n\nmeasurement was of the Ta metal. Hence, the values of hardness were similar. The sample \n\nthat was anodized at 50 V showed a lower hardness at indentation load of 25 g. This \n\nsample developed a higher thickness of oxide layer and the indenter was not able to \n\npenetrate this film completely. Hence the hardness measurement also had a major \n\ncontribution from this amorphous oxide film which had a lower hardness than Ta metal. \n\nHowever, the hardness value increased to match the values obtained from other samples \n\nwhen a higher indentation load of 100 g was used. This means that the oxide layer had \n\nbeen penetrated and the hardness value obtained was from Ta metal. This information can \n\nbe used to conclude that the oxide layer thickness has an effect on the surface hardness of \n\nthe samples and this could possibly affect their tribological behavior. \n\n \n\nTable 4.1.

Table 4.2 shows the average contact angle measurements \n\nobtained for the samples. The measurements were very similar to each other with very \n\nsmall deviations. It could be deduced that the nano texturing had not caused a significant \n\nchange in the wettability of Ta surfaces when saliva was used as liquid.  \n\nHowever possible experimentation could be performed in the future, to test the \n\ntime dependent wettability of the nano textured surfaces.  \n\n \n\nTable 4.2.

Surface Roughness \n\nThe results of 3-D profilometry performed on Ta samples treated at different \n\nconditions are presented in Table 4.3. Roughness results were obtained in both dry \n\nconditions and after immersion in saliva.  \n\n4.6.1. Surface roughness in dry condition \n\nThe polished untreated sample had the lowest surface roughness compared to \n\nthe other samples, which was expected since its surface had not undergone any surface \n\ntexturing treatment. The Rz surface roughness values for this sample were very small as \n\ncan be seen from Table 4.3. The Ta sample that was anodized after polishing, without \n\netching treatment, had a higher surface roughness than the polished sample. Even though \n\nno etching treatment had been performed on the surface, the anodization process itself \n\ncould be called an electrochemical etching process. Mechanical polishing is achieved by \n\nplastic deformation which changes the crystal structure on the surface more or less \n\nintensively by disturbing the orientation. The quality of surface is poorer compared to a \n\nchemically polished surface. Anodization is sensitive to the nature of the surface. The \n\n\n\n \n \n  Chapter 4 \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\nAyesha Khalid  27 \n\n \n\nuneven polished layers are etched off more easily than the undisturbed structure beneath \n\nthem. This uneven etching results in an increase in surface roughness. The increase in Rz \n\nvalue indicated that this surface had more peaks and valleys than the polished sample. \n\nHowever, this electrochemical treatment seemed to be less aggressive than chemical \n\netching, as indicated from the Rz value of this sample, which were smaller compared to the \n\nchemically etched sample. \n\nThe chemically etched Ta sample had a significantly higher surface roughness \n\ncompared to the polished surface and polished &amp; anodized surface. Etching in a strong acid \n\nsolution of nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid resulted in micro pitting on the surface and \n\nconsequently, in an increase in surface roughness. \n\nThe samples that were polished, etched and anodized at 15 V had a higher \n\nsurface roughness than the polished and anodized sample at the same potential. The acid \n\netching treatment improved the quality of the surface by removing scratches and \n\nirregularities. But it introduced micropits on the surface and anodization treatment at a low \n\nvoltage of 15 V did not significantly affect the micro scale surface roughness of the etched \n\nsample. However, at higher anodization potentials smaller Rz value was obtained, of \n\nsamples anodized at 25. This could be due to the increase in the intensity of \n\nelectrochemical attack which would have an increased smoothening effect and lead to a \n\ndecrease in surface roughness. An abnormally small Rz value was obtained at 50 V. \n\n4.6.2. Surface roughness after immersion in saliva \n\nThe profilometry measurements of Ta samples that had been kept in artificial \n\nsaliva showed a difference in surface roughness values compared to the data obtained in \n\ndry conditions. It would be hard to determine what changes occurred due to immersion in \n\nsaliva that caused the change in surface roughness. It requires further research and \n\nexperimentation. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4.3.

Static Friction Behavior \n\nThe static friction coefficient holds the most relevance in the study of the \n\ntribological behavior of the textured Ta surface as a dental implant material, as it is directly \n\nrelated to mechanical interlocking efficiency. The dental implant should be able to form a \n\ngood mechanically interlocking at the contact region with bone and micro motion should \n\nbe minimized, the static friction coefficient is desired to be high.

Figure 4.5 \n\nshows the surface roughness and static friction coefficient of Ta samples treated at \n\ndifferent conditions.  \n\nThe polished sample showed a very small static friction force peak and the \n\nstatic friction force was smaller than the dynamic friction force (Figure 4.4 (a)). This \n\noccurred due to the low Rz value associated with this sample (Table 4.3) i.e. the mean peak \n\nto valley height was small. Hence it could be deduced that the polished sample surface \n\nfailed to mechanically interlock effectively with the artificial bone material and slippage \n\noccurred readily. Hence, in Figure 4.5 it can be seen that the surface roughness value is the \n\nlowest, but the static friction coefficient (\u00b5s) value is higher than that of the sample \n\nanodized at 50 V. Even though the value of static friction coefficient was higher, the static \n\nfriction regime was very small. Therefore the polished sample could be called an abnormal \n\nfriction result. \n\nThe sample that was mechanically polished and anodized at 15 V had a static \n\nfriction coefficient value of 0.4 (Table 4.5). This could be correlated to the Rz value of \n\n7.22 \u00b5m (Table 4.3) which means that the surface had asperities that formed mechanical \n\ninterlocking effectively with the glass fiber epoxy surface. This high surface roughness \n\nmay have developed due to the non uniform growth of tantalum oxide that occurred as a \n\nresult of non uniform electrochemical etching during anodization. The surface may have \n\ndeveloped heterogeneities such as hardness, surface shear strength etc. which contributed \n\nto its friction behavior. The tantalum sheets that were supplied had poor surface quality. \n\nThe only treatment done on this sample that was polished and anodized at 15 V, for \n\nimproving the surface quality was mechanical polishing, hence some defects may have \n\nremained on the surface and these could have contributed to the static friction.  \n\nThe change in static friction coefficient of the etched and anodized samples \n\nwas similar, in trend, to change in their surface roughness (Figure 4.5). The chemically \n\netched sample surface had a smaller mean peak to valley height of roughness profile (Rz) \n\nthan the sample that was etched and anodized at 15 V. It also showed a smaller coefficient \n\nof friction. The anodized sample also had a higher contact rigidity compared to the etched \n\nsample (Table 4.4). This could have been due to the development of the amorphous \n\ntantalum oxide layer. This oxide layer would exhibit different surface properties than the \n\nTa surface. A previous research study showed that the hardness and elastic modulus of \n\ntantalum oxide layer varied with its thickness and thin oxide layers are capable of \n\nwithstanding large elastic deformations without failure [62]. \n\n\n\n \n\nTribological Behavior of micro/nano structured tantalum surfaces by anodization method \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\n32  2016 \n\n \n\nThe sample anodized at 25 V showed even higher rigidity. Anodization at 25 V \n\nresulted in a greater film thickness and the amorphous film showed greater elasticity at the \n\ncontact region. Hence it could be deduced that the oxide film thickness of this sample was \n\nwithin the limit of high elasticity defined in the research work mentioned in the previous \n\nparagraph [62]. However, it showed a lower static friction coefficient than the etched \n\nsample and the sample anodized at a lower potential of 15 V. This decrease in the static \n\nfriction was attributed to the low surface roughness of this sample. The Rz value of this \n\nsample was significantly smaller compared to the etched and the anodized samples; hence \n\nit may have formed poorer mechanical interlocking. Despite the significant difference in \n\nthe surface roughness, the static friction of this sample was not significantly smaller than \n\nthe one anodized at 15 V or the chemically etched sample. This may have been because of \n\nthe higher rigidity at contact region caused due to the good elasticity of the film, which \n\nhindered initiation of slippage.  It has been observed that at increasing oxide film thickness \n\n(>100 nm), this elastic behavior decreases and more plastic strain is observed [62].  From \n\nTable 4.4, comparing the etched and anodized samples it can be seen that contact rigidity \n\nincreased i.e. the etched sample had the lowest contact rigidity, which increased for the \n\nsample anodized at 15 V and the highest was achieved for the sample anodized at 25 V. \n\nHowever, contact rigidity decreased for the sample that was anodized at 50 V. The Rz \n\nvalue of this sample was also the lowest, compared to the other anodized samples. \n\nConsequently, this sample exhibited the lowest static friction coefficient.  This sample had \n\nthe highest oxide film thickness. From the SEM image in Figure 4.2 (e) it was observed \n\nthat the oxide layer was not homogenously formed. The surface was non uniform and the \n\npores were larger and irregular. This surface also exhibited lower hardness value. These \n\nfactors may have contributed towards the sample\u2019s poor friction performance compared to \n\nthe other anodized samples. \n\nThe surface roughness of the different Ta sample surfaces seemed to be the \n\ndominant factor in determining their static friction behavior. However, other contributions \n\nsuch as surface adhesion and the effect of the surface properties of oxide layer were not \n\nstudied. \n\n4.7.2. Dynamic Friction Behavior \n\nThe dynamic friction behavior represents how the sample surface would \n\nbehave when it start sliding. Although sliding of a dental implant is not desired, it is \n\n\n\n \n \n  Chapter 4 \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\nAyesha Khalid  33 \n\n \n\nimportant to have knowledge about the dynamic friction behavior as it helps in \n\nunderstanding the micro motion behavior of the implants and also their failure \n\nmechanisms. \n\nThe polished sample showed the highest dynamic friction coefficient compared \n\nto the treated samples. This could be explained in terms of the surface polishing which led \n\nto an increase in surface flatness. This was supported by the very small Rz surface \n\nroughness value of polished sample (Table 4.3), which indicated a very flat surface. This \n\nled to an increase in the contact area between Ta and the glass fiber epoxy composite. A \n\nhigher sliding force was required to drag the Ta surface over the composite\u2019s surface. \n\nHowever, the contact rigidity was the smallest, compared to other samples (Table 4.4). \n\nDespite the high dynamic friction coefficient, the absence of any effective static contact \n\nand consequently the failure of the un-textured sample to form an effective mechanically \n\ninterlocking with artificial bone and hence resulted in small contact rigidity.  \n\nFigure 4.6 shows the comparison of static and dynamic friction coefficients of \n\nthe etched and the anodized samples. The dynamic friction coefficient was smaller than the \n\nstatic friction coefficient in all cases. This is a typical friction behavior that surfaces \n\nexhibit. In the initial stage of sliding, the surface asperities undergo deformation and wear \n\ni.e. the running-in effect. Sliding could be described as a polishing phenomenon as it leads \n\nto surface smoothening resulting from wear. The Ta sample surfaces were worn due to \n\nsliding contact with glass fiber epoxy composite and the wear marks were observable with \n\nthe naked eye.  \n\nThe Ta surface anodized at 15 V after mechanical polishing had a lower \n\ndynamic friction coefficient than the surface anodized at the same potential after etch \n\ntreatment. This could be related to the quality of oxide film that formed on both surfaces. \n\nThe anodized Ta surface may have worn off more easily due to the poor adherence of the \n\noxide film to the metal surface. Scratch tests could provide a more detailed insight into this \n\nargument but this would have to be left for future work due to the shortage of time. \n\nHowever this argument makes sense as the wear track of this sample showed a shinier \n\nsurface than the etched sample, hence a higher degree of wear (Chapter 4.8).  \n\nThe samples anodized at higher potentials had lower dynamic friction \n\ncoefficients compared to the samples anodized at 15 V. These thicker oxide layers maye \n\nhave been more easily worn away. The surface shear strength may have changed as surface \n\ntexturing occurred at higher potential.

Static Friction Behavior in Artificial Saliva (Dry vs. Wet) \n\nPast research has shown that artificial saliva has shown conflicting results. In \n\nsome cases it has caused a decrease in static friction while in other cases it led to an \n\nincrease in static friction. Static friction tests performed on orthodontic wires in a similar \n\nmanner as the one performed in this research led to varying results.  Kusy et al. [63] for \n\nexample, concluded that artificial saliva was an inadequate replacement for human saliva \n\nand hence any experiments related to it as incorrect. Andreasen and Quevedo [64] \n\nsuggested that the saliva does not play a significant role, while Read-Ward et al. [65] \n\nconcluded that the presence of human saliva had an inconsistent effect on static friction \n\nand sliding mechanics. Furthermore, Baker et al. [66] reported that saliva had a lubricating \n\neffect whereas Stannard et al. [67] reported that saliva increased friction. Therefore a \n\ncommon effect of artificial saliva on friction properties has not been reported as there have \n\nbeen conflicted reports of the adhesive and lubricating effect of saliva. In the previous \n\nreports the artificial saliva was sprayed onto the sample during the test to maintain constant \n\nwetting condition. In this thesis, the effect of artificial saliva was studied by immersing the \n\nsamples in artificial saliva solution for three days at a constant temperature of 37 ?C, after \n\nwhich the samples were removed and friction tests were performed.

However, the sample that was anodized at 25 V, after polishing and \n\netching, showed a significant increase in static fricition coefficient in wet condition. A \n\nsimilar result was seen for the case of Ta sample anodized at 50 V. It is hard to provide a \n\nspecific reason for this difference as there could be various factors that may have \n\ncontributed to this significant increase in static friction coefficient. It could have been that \n\nchemical deposits from the saliva solution, such as NaCl, formed more readily on these \n\nsurfaces and raised the friction coefficient. More testing is required to reach a solid \n\nconclusion.  \n\n4.7.4. Dynamic friction behavior in dry vs. wet conditions \n\nThe anodized Ta samples behaved quite differently from static conditions when \n\nsliding initiated.  The Table 4.7 provides the compiled data of dynamic friction \n\ncoefficients, of Ta samples, obtained in dry and wet conditions. The polished and etched \n\nsamples had lower dynamic friction coefficients in wet condition. However the anodized \n\nsamples showed an increase in dynamic friction. Table 4.7 shows that the friction plots of \n\nsamples anodized at 15 V achieved steady state regime at higher forces, even though the \n\nstatic friction force was slightly lower. The samples anodized at 25 V and 50 V had a \n\nsignificant increase in dynamic friction. It is also interesting to note that the friction \n\ncoefficient of sample anodized at 50V was still lower than the other etched and anodized \n\nsamples. This could be attributed to the non uniform oxide layer that formed on the surface \n\nat this potential and the decreased hardness of the surface due to increased oxide thickness.  \n\n\n\n \n \n  Chapter 4 \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\nAyesha Khalid  37 \n\n \n\nDynamic friction behavior did not show dependence on the Rz surface \n\nroughness.

Static friction vs. Surface roughness \n\nAfter discussing the static and dynamic friction behavior of Ta samples treated \n\nat different conditions, a clear relationship between the surface roughness and static \n\nfriction behavior needed to be established in order to test the hypothesis that surface \n\nroughness plays a dominant role in determining the static friction behavior of Ta surface. \n\nHence a scatter graph of static friction coefficient vs surface roughness (Rz) of Ta surfaces, \n\nin both dry and wet conditions, was plotted and a line of best fit was used to obtain the \n\ntrend in the scatter of points (Figure 4.8). Majority of the data points are evenly distributed \n\nabout the trend line and majority of the data points lay close to the line, which shows that \n\nthe static friction coefficient is influenced by surface roughness.  \n\nHence from this research study it could be deduced that the surface roughness \n\naffects the static friction behavior of textured Ta surfaces. It is, however, important to state \n\nthat this was a preliminary research study that was conducted to test a hypothesis and the \n\nresults showed promising potential if this research study is extended and more \n\nexperimental testing and characterization is performed. \n\n\n\n \n\nTribological Behavior of micro/nano structured tantalum surfaces by anodization method \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\n38  2016 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.8.

Wear analysis \n\nWhen the static friction at the Ta/glass fiber epoxy contact region was \n\novercome, the Ta sample started to slide. The Ta samples exhibited wear at the sliding \n\ncontact region. The wear regions were observed under an optical microscope and the \n\ndegree of wear on the surface of different samples was compared.  \n\n4.8.1.

Figure 4.9 (a) shows the surface of \n\nthe polished Ta sample. The image shows a circle of contrast in the middle, which is the \n\nsliding contact region. Sliding did not seem to have caused significant degree of wear on \n\nthe polished Ta surface. Figure 4.9 (b) shows the surface of Ta sample anodized at 15 V \n\nafter mechanical polishing. The sliding contact region is much more visible and brighter in \n\nthis image. This surface was scratched and worn to a higher degree compared to the \n\npolished Ta surface.   \n\nFigure 4.9 (c) shows the surface of chemically etched Ta sample. The central circular \n\nregion of sliding contact region can be observed in the image. This region showed that \n\nsliding on the etched Ta surface had to caused high degree of wear.

It also leads \n\nto some micro pitting on the metal surface. The micro pits on etched Ta surface were \n\nobserved in Figure 4.1 (c). Thus etched metal surface usually shows bright and dark \n\ncontrast regions. The image in Figure 4.9(c) was taken at low magnification, hence the \n\nbright regions are only visible as bright spots on the surface.  \n\nFigure 4.9(d) &amp; (e) show that the sliding contact region in surfaces anodized at 15 and 25 \n\nV respectively, had a brighter sliding contact region compared to etched surface. The \n\nsliding region on these surfaces show higher degree of scratching and wear compared to \n\netched Ta surface. The anodized samples had a nano-textured Ta2O5 surface. In Chapter \n\n4.3 (Crystal structure)  it had been discussed that the oxide layer was amorphous (Figure \n\n4.3). Hence the surface properties of the anodized samples would be expected to be \n\ndifferent. The amorphous oxide would be expected to be more brittle and have different \n\nshear strength than Ta metal. Due to the anodic attack, the textured surfaces would also be \n\nexpected to have higher stresses. These and other surface properties might have made them \n\nmore susceptible to wear than un-anodized metal surface, hence the higher degree of wear \n\nand scratching. The scratches are oriented in the direction of sliding \n\nFigure 4.9 (f) shows the surface of Ta sample anodized at 50 V. The image shows different \n\ncolors compared to images of other samples in Figure 4.9, the bright spots appearing \n\nyellower and the sliding region appearing grey-green. This was caused by the characteristic \n\ngrey-green colored oxide film that developed at 50 V (discussed previously in Chapter 4.1, \n\nin reference to Figure 4.1 (f)). Figure 4.9 (f) shows that the sliding contact region does not \n\nshow a clear distinct shape. The scratches on the surface are oriented in the direction of \n\nsliding and the surface with the bright yellow spots could possibly be the exposed etched \n\nsurface after some oxide film has worn away.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nTribological Behavior of micro/nano structured tantalum surfaces by anodization method \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\n40  2016 \n\n \n\n   \n \n\n   \n \n\nFigure 4.9.

Wet condition \n\nThe wear marks in Figure 4.10 were formed on Ta surface that had been \n\nimmersed in artificial saliva for three days prior to friction tests. The polished and etched \n\nsample showed low wear at sliding region (Figure 4.10 (a)&amp;(c)), which was similar to the \n\nobservations made on these surfaces in dry conditions (Figure 4.9 (a)&amp;(c)).

The \n\nsurface showed considerable scratching and wear.  \n\nThe samples that were etched and anodized at 15 and 25 V (Figure 4.10 \n\n(d)&amp;(e)) also showed bright sliding regions. The scratches and wear in the region was \n\neasily observable. The sliding region on the sample anodized at 50 V (Figure 4.10 (f)) was \n\nvery visible under the microscope. The oxide layer had clearly been worn away as the \n\nbright metal surface was exposed at the sliding region, in clear contrast to the dull grey-\n\ngreen oxide surface in the surrounding regions.  \n\nThe anodized surfaces in both dry and wet conditions showed a higher degree \n\nof wear than un-anodized surfaces.

Three different average pore \n\nsizes were obtained at different potentials, SEM images showed that highly ordered nano \n\ntexturing had been achieved by the electrochemical process.  \n\nXRD patterns of the treated Ta samples showed that the tantalum oxide film \n\nwas amorphous and preferential etching had occured on the treated surfaces. The hardness \n\nresults showed that the amorphous oxide layer is softer than the metal and the hardness \n\ntends to change with oxide thickness as effect of the metal on the overall hardness \n\ndecreases.Wetting contact angle measurements showed that there was no significant \n\nchange in the wetting behavior of treated and untreated Ta surfaces.  \n\n3-d profilometry measurements showed that anodization influenced the micro-\n\nsurface roughness (Rz).The static friction coefficient showed an almost linear dependancy \n\non the micro surface roughness. Dynamic friction coefficient did not show a clear \n\nrelationship to surface roughness. The anodized Ta surfaces had nano textured amorphous \n\noxide layer and showed a higher degree of wear than the un-anodized Ta surfaces.  \n\nIt can be concluded that nano texturing by  anodization treatment caused the \n\nsurface roughness to change on the micron level. The surface roughness was a major \n\ncontributor to the static friction behavior of the untreated and treated Ta surfaces. Hence, \n\nwhen deciding the optimum nano texture, by anodization, for biological performane of Ta \n\ndental implant it is also important to assess its friction behavior, as  it plays an important \n\nrole in defining the performance of the dental implant when it is inserted into the jaw and \n\nbrought into contact with bone. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n  Future work \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\nAyesha Khalid  43 \n\n \n\nFUTURE WORK \n \n\n \n\n1. The friction tests on nano textured Ta surfaces will be performed with real \n\nbone material to obtain a more realistic result of the friction behavior of the \n\ntextured Ta surfaces as dental implants. \n\n \n\n2. Study the history of the materials before sample preparation \n\n \n\n3. The Ta surfaces will be anodized at more magnitudes of voltage in order to \n\nachieve a wider range of pore size on the textured surface. This could \n\nprovide more information and data regarding the relationship between \n\nsurface roughness and friction behavior of nano textured Ta surfaces. \n\n \n\n4. Scratch tests will performed to study the adhesion of oxide film formed at \n\ndifferent voltages during anodization, as this could provide more \n\ninformation regarding the wear behavior of nano textured Ta surfaces. \n\n \n\n5. The experiments will be repeated for higher number of times to obtain a \n\nmore statistically improved data. \n\n \n\n6. The time dependent wetting behavior of nano textured Ta surfaces, with \n\nartificial saliva, will be studied. \n\n \n\n7. The fretting behavior of the nano textured Ta surfaces will be studied. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n   \n  Bibliography \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\n44  2016 \n\n \n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY \n \n\n \n\n[1]   Z.
