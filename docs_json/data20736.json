The \npresent basin margin morphologies and architectures \nare mainly the result of a series of glacial-interglacial \ncycles (MEIJER, 2002). \n\nSeveral studies suggest that the Quaternary \nevolution of the coastal plain and adjacent continental \nshelf of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) is mainly determined \nby the sea-level (CORR\u00caA, 1986, 1995, 1996; \nDILLENBURG et al., 2004; MARTINS et al., 1985, \n1996; TOMAZELLI; VILLWOCK, 2000; \nVILLWOCK; TOMAZELLI, 1995; VILLWOCK et \nal., 1986). \n\n\n\n                             \n\n \n\nThe sedimentary systems along the southern \nBrazilian marginal basins have been strongly affected \nby sea-level cycles. The present physiography of the \ncoastal plain and continental shelf is mainly the result \nof Quaternary high-frequency, glacio-eustatic, sea-\nlevel changes. \n\nThe close association between sea level \nvariation and fluvial incision on continental shelves \nhas been demonstrated in several papers (BLUM; \nT\u00d6RNQVIST, 2000; CONTI; FURTADO, 2009; \nHORI et al., 2002; KOSS et al., 1994). Basically, \nduring an event of relative fall in sea-level, the \nchannels and valleys formed by fluvial systems extend \ntheir limits basinward, widening the exposed shelf and \neroding into underlying strata. The exposed shelf (the \n\u201cnewly formed coastal plain\u201d), usually composed of \nunconsolidated sediments, is incised by valleys linking \nthe drainage basin onland to the depositional settings \n\non the marginal basin offshore. The coastal prism, \ndeposited during a previous sea-level highstand event, \nis usually deeply dissected.  \n\nTracking the spatial distribution of the \npaleodrainage network and the unconformities, \nproduced by such erosional processes during a fall in \nsea-level, is useful to improve the current models of \nsequence stratigraphy proposed for margin-shelf \nsettings. \n\nIn this paper the paleodrainage systems are \nmapped on the coastal plain and the continental shelf \nof RS (Fig. 1). The former drainage systems are \nreconstructed mainly from the paleoincisions observed \nin high-resolution seismic data. Timing of the incision \nof the paleodrainage networks is discussed. The \ngeological evolution of the coastal plain and \ncontinental shelf of RS during the Quaternary is also \naddressed. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFig. 1.

Four lagoon-barrier \ntype depositional systems, related to transgressive-\nregressive events of the Late Quaternary period, have \nbeen recognized on the RS coastal plain \n(TOMAZELLI; VILLWOCK, 2000; VILLWOCK; \nTOMAZELLI, 1995). A correlation between the sea-\nlevel highstands and major peaks of the oxygen \nisotope curve has been established by Villwock and \nTomazelli (1995), which should confirm the \ncorrelation between sea level oscillations and climate \nchanges (ZAZO et al., 2008). \n\nAlthough several transgressive and \nregressive events have left their distinct topographic, \ndepositional, erosional and sedimentary imprint, the \npresent morphology of the RS continental shelf is in \ngeneral homogeneous. It is characterized by a smooth \nmorphology with a very gentle gradient (1.3\u20131.4 \nm/km) and an average width of 125 km. The northern \nsection is narrow and homogeneous, whereas the \nsouthern section is wider and gently dissected. The \nusually smooth shelf morphology is interrupted, \nmainly in the south portion, by sand bodies such as \nsand waves. Associated with these sand bodies are \nelongated bioclastic deposits which have been \ninterpreted as paleoshoreline indicators (CORR\u00caA, \n1996). The presence of marine terraces with \nconsiderably steeper slopes throughout the shelf has \nbeen interpreted as a record of periods of stabilization \nin the sea-level during the Holocene transgressive \nevent (CORR\u00caA, 1996). \n\nAccording to Corr\u00eaa (1986), the Holocene \ntransgression began approximately 17.5 ky BP, when \nthe sea-level was 120 m lower than the present level. \nBefore this event, the present inner shelf surface was \nsubaerial coastal plain, subject to erosion and to fluvial \nincision. Beach ridges, consisting of coarse sand, were \nformed along the paleocoastline; fine sand was \ndeposited on the inner shelf, whereas clay and clayey \nsand dominated the outer shelf and the upper slope. \nAround 5 ky BP, the sea was 5-6 m above the present \nlevel during the Holocene Climatic Optimum. During \nthis phase, the drainage channels became shorter \nlandwards and fine sediments were deposited in \ndeeper waters, while reworking transgressive sands in \nthe coastal zone. Paleocoastline stabilization is marked \nby bioclastic gravels and heavy mineral \nconcentrations. \n\nNowadays, the RS coastal plain is \ncharacterized by wide lowlands covering an area \naround 33,000 sq km, bordering highlands to the west. \nThe main physiographic feature is the Patos Lagoon, \nwith 240 km length and an average width of 40 km \n(Fig. 1). The lagoonal deposits consist of marginal \nsands and muddy sediments (up to 6 m thick) in the \n\ninterior of the lagoon (TOLDO-JR et al., 2000). The \nlagoon receives a great river discharge and transports \nit to the Atlantic Ocean through a single tidal inlet near \nthe city of Rio Grande. No evidence for severe storms \nin this area during the Holocene has been reported, and \nthe tidal amplitude averages &lt;40 cm. \n \n\nMETHODS \n \n\nThis study is primarily based on the analysis \nof seismic reflection profiles obtained in the Patos \nLagoon. It focuses on the identification and mapping \nof the former drainage network that dissected the area \nof study. The established geological framework for the \ncoastal and marine geology of southern Brazil has \ncorroborated the achievement of some of the goals set \nfor this study. \n\nA 3.5 kHz seismic-reflection data survey \nwas performed in the Patos Lagoon (Fig. 1; profiles 1 \nto 12) in December, 2002. The cruise was carried out \naboard the research vessel Larus of the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o \nUniversidade do Rio Grande. The positioning of the \nseismic lines was determined by a DGPS system \nlinked to the subbottom profiler system. The seismic \nequipment used was a GeoAcoustics subbottom \nprofiler, consisting of a GeoPulse transmitter (model \n5430A), a GeoPulse receiver (model 5210A), a 132B \ntransducer array (4 mount), a graphic recorder EPC-\nGSP-1086, a GeoPro processor system and seismic \ndata acquisition software. The transducers were \nmounted on a plate at the end of a vertical, gimbaled \nstaff supported by a mounting pad fixed over the \nvessel\u00b4s side. The dataset was saved in analogical and \ndigital formats. \n\nIn addition, seismic sections (3.5 and 7 kHz) \nobtained at the Patos Lagoon during a former research \ncruise (TOLDO-JR et al., 2000) were analyzed (Fig. 1; \ndashed line seismic sections). The data survey was \nperformed using a shallow seismic system RTT 1000, \nfrom Raytheon, consisting of a 719 C RTT recorder, a \n3.5/7 kHz transducer, and a PTR 106 C transceiver. \nThe analysis and interpretation of the seismic data \nwere based on the configuration of the reflectors, \naccording to the general concepts established in the \nfield of seismic stratigraphy (MITCHUM-JR. et al., \n1977). We assumed velocity of sound in sediments of \n1,650 m/s to evaluate the thickness of the sedimentary \npackages by converting travel times into meters \n(JONES, 1999). \n \n\nRESULTS \n \n\nThe analysis of the seismic profiles reveals \nthe architectural elements that make up the \nsedimentary pile deposited in the Patos Lagoon during \nthe Late Quaternary. These elements are identified \n\n                   WESCHENFELDER ET AL.: QUATERNARY PALEOCHANNELS IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL                     37 \n \n\n\n\n                             \n\n \n\nthrough the configurations of the reflectors, namely \nexternal geometry, lateral termination and internal \nconfiguration. \n\nWell delineated paleochannels, or other \nfeatures indicating their occurrence, were identified in \nalmost all the seismic profiles analyzed. However, the \nrecords of the 3.5 kHz seismic profiles 1 to 12 (Fig. 1) \nprovided a better resolution and deeper penetration \nthan the 3.5 and 7 kHz sections obtained previously \n(dashed line seismic section in Figure 1). \n\nSystematic mapping of the seismic surfaces \nmakes clear the presence of two distinct, well-defined \ncut-and-fill paleochannel systems (Fig. 2). The older \n\npaleochannel system is buried by a sedimentary unit \nup to 8 m thick (Figs 2B, D), whereas the younger \npaleochannel system is blanked by a centimeter-thin \nveneer of sediments (Figs 2C, E; Fig. 3). The seismic \nreflectors of the older paleochannel system are \nintersected by the reflectors of the younger, indicating \nthe relative timing of incision, i.e., the incision and \ninfilling of the older paleochannel system (Fig. 2A). \nThe uppermost reflectors of the seismic facies \nrepresenting the sedimentary infill of the younger \npaleochannel system are truncated in some places by \nreflectors attributed to the modern lagoon bottom (Figs \n2C, E). \n\n \n\n  \nFig. 2.

They are some \nhundred of meters wide and the sedimentary infill \nreaches thicknesses up to 15 m. Paleochannels are \ninfilled with seismic facies units filling a negative \nrelief in the underlying strata. The underlying \nreflections are mainly parallel to subparallel and \ncontinuous to discontinuous, showing truncation along \nthe continuous basal surface of the channels. The \nupper reflectors of the seismic facies filling up these \npaleochannels are truncated by a well-marked, strong \nand continuous reflector of the overlying strata. The \noverlying strata are composed of continuous, parallel \nto subparallel, gently dipping reflectors (Figs 2B, D). \n\nThe largest paleochannel in profile 2 is about \n1.5 km wide and the sedimentary channel-fill \nsediments are at least 20 m thick (Figs 2C, E). This \nlarge paleochannel is included in the younger group of \npaleochannels. The underlying strata are mainly \ncomposed of seismic facies with parallel and \nsubparallel, continuous to discontinuous reflectors \n(Fig. 2E). Truncation of the seismic reflectors marks \n\nthe basal surface of the channel. The lowermost \nchannel fill seismic facies presents dipping reflectors \nthroughout the entire channel. Discontinuous, weak \nand strong reflectors delineate mounded onlap, \nprograded, and complex fill patterns onlapping the \nunderlying unconformity (Fig. 2E, inset i). A \nlaminated to acoustically transparent seismic facies \ndelineates a mounded onlap pattern (Fig. 2E, inset ii). \nThe seismic facies of insets iii and iv are similar. \nHowever, the upper fill seismic facies unit presents \nmore undulating, stronger to opaque, reflectors. The \nyoungest seismic-facies unit is marked by acoustically \nlaminated deposits onlapping the underlying unit at a \nvery low angle. The reflectors are continuous, parallel \nto semiparallel, dipping gently to the lagoon interior. \nIn some places the upper reflectors are truncated by \nthe lagoon bottom reflector (Fig. 2E, inset v). As \nindicated by the radiocarbon dating \n(WESCHENFELDER et al., 2008b), the main period \nof sedimentary filling of this channel is Holocene. \n\nProfile 7 (N-S) extends for over 10 km. It \nwas obtained along the eastern lagoon margin, in a \nnorth-to-south direction. The water along the profile is \naround 5 m deep except at the southern end of the \nprofile, where the ship crossed a lagoon terrace \ncovered by about 2 m of water. Various paleochannels \nwere mapped on this seismic line. The base of the \nchannels is delineated by a strong reflector truncating \nthe reflectors of the underlying strata (Figs 3A, B). \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\nFig. 3.

This large paleochannel is adjacent \nto another one of the same magnitude, located at the \nsouth end of the profile. Further, various \npaleochannels with widths ranging from a few meters \nto hundreds of meters and with depths ranging from \napproximately 1 to 4 m are present throughout the \nprofile (Fig. 3B). In some places the uppermost \nreflectors are truncated by reflectors attributed to the \nlagoon bottom, similar to those found in a previously \nmentioned paleochannel of profile 2. \n\nProfile I was obtained across the active \nintralagoonal delta of the Camaqu\u00e3 River, in a \nsouthwest-to-northeast direction. The southwestern \nend of the profile reveals the presence of a wide buried \npaleochannel, more than 1 km wide and up to 7 m \ndeep. Profile I showed a larger buried channel at its \ncenter, but the presence of gas-rich sediments formed \nan acoustic blanking layer, which hindered its exact \ndelineation (Fig. 4). \n\nProfile II was also recorded on the western \nborder of the lagoon, in a southeast-to-northwest \ndirection. It is located about 15 km south of the \n\npresent mouth of the Camaqu\u00e3 River (Fig. 1). Water \ndepths range from about 3 m at the northwest end of \nthe profile to 5 m at the southeast end of the profile. \nThe records show a wide (up to 2 km) and deep \n(around 10 m) buried paleovalley flanked by a strong, \nirregular and undulating, well-marked reflector. The \nburied paleochannel is infilled in the middle reaches \nby a thick sedimentary unit, which presents no clear \nevidences of channel cutting (e.g., by the Camaqu\u00e3 \nchannel) (Fig. 5). \n\nIt is worthwhile to mention that acoustic \nanomalies, due to gas-rich sediments are present in \nsome sectors of the seismic profiles. The gas trapped \nappears as a strong reflection, somewhat masking the \nunderlying reflectors (JUDD; HOVLAND, 1992; \nWESCHENFELDER et al., 2006). The profiles far \nfrom the lagoon margin are especially strongly \naffected by this acoustic phenomenon (e.g., profiles 8, \n10 and 12), contrasting with those situated near the \nmargin (e.g., profiles 2, 7 and 11). Moreover, the \nshallow water depths contributed to low signal \npenetration in some sectors, associated with the \nrecurrent multiple reflector of the lagoon bottom. \n\n \n \n\n \n \nFig. 4.

The present continental shelf of RS \nshows a homogeneous and smooth morphology with a \nvery gentle gradient, broadly reflecting the regional \nformer coastal plain topography prior to the Holocene \npostglacial marine transgression (DILLENBURG et \nal., 2000). \n\nThe preservation potential of the Holocene \nsedimentary records along the north and central coast \nof RS was addressed by DILLENBURG et al. (2000). \nThe study shows, for the north coast that the pre-\nexisting Pleistocene morphology was deeply dissected \nby fluvial channels before the Holocene marine \ntransgression, contrasting with evidence of a smooth \nand dissection-free morphology in the central coast \nnear the town of Bojuru. The study also indicates that \nthe depth of shoreface erosion ranges from 3 to 10 m \nfor the present RS northern coast. This value was \nestimated assuming a transgressing sea in a shoreface \nretreatment model (REINSON, 1992). \n\nOur seismic data indicate that the central \npart of the Rio Grande do Sul coastal plain was deeply \ndissected during Late Pleistocene lowstands by fluvial \nchannels prior to transgressive events \n(WESCHENFELDER et al., 2005, 2008a,b). Two \npaleochannel systems can be established in the area of \nstudy. The older paleochannel system is relatively \ndeeply buried by a sedimentary package up to 8 m \nthick (e.g., Figs 2B, d). A younger paleochannel \nsystem practically crops out on the bottom of the Patos \nLagoon (e.g., Figs 2C, E; Fig. 3). The channel filling \nof the younger drainage system is Holocene, as \nindicated by radiocarbon dating (WESCHENFELDER \net al., 2008b). The channel incisions are thus related to \nthe Last Glacial Maximum (Marine Isotope Stage) \n(MIS 2) of the Late Pleistocene, when the sea-level \nfell to a depth of 120 m below its present position. The \nolder paleochannel system formation and filling \nwould, therefore, be related to a previous regressive-\ntransgressive event of the Pleistocene, e.g. MIS 6 \n(WESCHENFELDER et al., 2008a). \n\nThe two paleochannel systems just \nmentioned (Late Pleistocene; Latest Pleistocene-\nHolocene) were mapped from seismic records. The \ndrainage lines were extended through the continental \nshelf to the shelf edge by means of morphostructural \ndata (CORR\u00caA, 1996; MARTINS et al., 1996). \nLandwards, the paleodrainage lines were linked with \nthe main present river courses (Fig. 6). \n\nThe Camaqu\u00e3 River is the main drainage \nsource entering the midwestern part of the Patos \nLagoon. The upper and middle courses of the main \n\nrivers reaching the coastal plain of RS (e.g., the \nPiratini, Camaqu\u00e3 and Jacu\u00ed Rivers) (Fig. 1) have \nmaintained a relatively fixed position during the \nQuaternary. They drain a stable Precambrian basement \nand, from Porto Alegre northwards, the Paleozoic to \nMesozoic volcano-sedimentary sequences of the \nParan\u00e1 basin. However, the lower courses of these \nrivers have drained an unconsolidated sedimentary \ncoastal plain. \n\nThe lower course of the Camaqu\u00e3 River has \ncut mainly into alluvial fans of the Pliocene and \nPleistocene. The onset of channel incision probably \noccurred during the Early Pleistocene. It has been \nexcavated principally since the Middle Pleistocene and \nespecially during the 130 m sea-level lowstand that \noccurred during the forced regression related to the \nmaximum of the Wisconsin Glaciation. During the \ntransgressive episodes following the glaciations, the \nCamaqu\u00e3 incised valley was a depositional setting for \nsediments from coastal and continental environments, \ndeposited in a multitude of sedimentation cycles. \n\nA paleochannel inlet between the Patos \nLagoon and the Atlantic Ocean was hypothesized by \nToldo-Jr. et al. (1991, 2000). According to this \nhypothesis, the narrow and shallow reentrance on the \nlagoon coast near Bojuru (called `Barra Falsa \nchannel`) is a morphological inheritance from a \nHolocene inlet. When the axis of this inlet is extended \ninto the lagoon it intercepts profile 2, just where a \nprominent paleochannel occurs (Figs 2c, e). Hence, the \nentrance to the lagoon near Bojuru most probably \nrepresents a morphological feature left over from a \nformer wide channel connecting the Patos Lagoon to \nthe Atlantic Ocean. The Holocene channel filling \nsequence was determined by sea-level changes, \nclimatic oscillations and coastal barrier-inlet \ndevelopment (WESCHENFELDER et al., 2008b). \n\nTwo placer deposits, located backshore, \noccur in the area of study. The placer located between \nthe marine coastline and the town of Bojuru, known as \nthe Bojuru placer, has been related to ancient deltaic \nsediments of the Camaqu\u00e3 River, which were \nreworked by coastal processes during sea-level \nhighstands (DILLENBURG et al., 2004). The second \nplacer is located at approximately the same latitude as \nthe place where profile 1 intercepts profile 2, \npresenting similar characteristics to the Bojuru placer. \nWe have, therefore, envisaged two Late \nPleistocene/Holocene paths related to the former \nCamaqu\u00e3 River. They were delineated by linking the \npresent river course to the paleochannel incisions \nmapped out from the seismic records and, continuing \nbasinward, across the adjacent continental shelf (Fig. \n6). \n\nThe paleochannels mapped out from profile \n7 probably correspond to the former course of the \nJacu\u00ed River (Fig. 3). In profile 7 the main \n\n                   WESCHENFELDER ET AL.: QUATERNARY PALEOCHANNELS IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL                     41 \n \n\n\n\n                             \n\n \n\npaleochannels cut through the entire recorded \nsedimentary pile, similar to the sequence of events \nrecorded in the Camaqu\u00e3 paleochannel in profile 2 \n(Figs 2C, E). The smaller paleochannels occurring in \nprofiles 2 and 7, usually cutting only the uppermost \nstrata, could be tributaries of the main river courses or \nindependent smaller drainage courses. \n\nThe Camaqu\u00e3 and Jacu\u00ed rivers excavated \ndeep, wide incisions in the coastal plain, triggered by \nthe last forced regression event (Wisconsin Glaciation) \n(Last Glacial Maximum). These channels probably \nrepresented an important river-shelf bypassing system, \nlinking the drainage basin to the west with the \ndepositional settings to the east. \n\n \n \n\n \n \nFig. 6.

The paleochannels that dissected the shelf \nbefore the transgressive events can be linked through \nthe coastal plain to the present river network inland. \nThe paleodrainage map of Figure 6 represents former \nriver-shelf systems, linking the drainage basin inland \nto the depositional settings in the Pelotas marginal \nbasin. \n\nThe bypassing discharge of the younger \ndrainage system (Latest Pleistocene/Holocene in \nFigure 6) fed a complex of delta systems installed on \nthe shelf edge of RS during the sea-level lowstand that \nlasted until the end of the last glaciation at around 17.5 \nky (ANGULO; LESSA, 1997; DILLENBURG et al., \n2004). The Holocene transgressive post-glacial event \ndrowned the Pleistocene incised paleochannels, \ninfilling them and, finally, closing the inlets formerly \nexisting between the Patos Lagoon and the Atlantic \nOcean. The contours of the Patos Lagoon were thus \nestablished and there remains the single inlet to the \nsouth. Presently, the lagoon captures a significant river \ndischarge and conducts it to the ocean through a large \ninlet near the city of Rio Grande. \n \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n \n\nThe continuous seismic-reflection profiles, \nobtained at the Patos Lagoon, allowed us to recognize \nthe shallow architectural elements that built up the \nsedimentary pile accumulated on the Rio Grande do \nSul coastal plain. \n\nIncision networks deeply dissected the \ncoastal plain and the continental shelf before the \ninstallation of the subsequent postglacial Holocene \ntransgressive events. The paleodrainage networks \nrepresented river-shelf systems, linking the drainage \nbasin inland and the depositional setting of the Pelotas \nmarginal basin, bypassing the continental shelf \nexposed by forced regression events. \n\nThe two drainage systems identified through \nthe seismic records were formed during two distinct \nperiods. The sedimentary filling of the younger \npaleochannel system is Holocene, as indicated by \nabsolute radiocarbon dating. Its incision is related to \nthe last forced regression of the end of the Pleistocene \nperiod. The incision and the filling of the older \nchannel system are most probably related to a previous \ntransgression-regression event of the Late Pleistocene. \n\nThe drainage network incised into the Rio \nGrande do Sul coastal plain and the adjacent \ncontinental shelf played an important role in the basin-\nmargin\u00b4s architecture, the facies distribution and the \nspatial accommodation that occurred during the \nQuaternary. \n \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \n\nSupport for this research project has been \nprovided by the Conselho Nacional de \nDesenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico - CNPq \u2013 \nBrasil (Proc. 560661/2008-8). \n \n\nREFERENCES \n \nABREU, J.
