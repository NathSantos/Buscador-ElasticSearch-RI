This situation is particularly serious in the West region, where the extant river basins are under strong human pressure and there is still a considerable gap in knowledge about the genetic structure of the populations of native cyprinid species, most of which are imperilled. Thus, the main goal of this thesis was to provide genetic and biogeographic data which can be useful for a more efficient conservation management of native cyprinid species in this region. The mitochondrial cytochrome b gene was used to assess the genetic diversity and estimate the divergence time between populations from West region and those from the neighbour river basins of Mondego, Tejo and Sado. The results suggest that cyprinids colonized the West region during the Holocene via two independent routes: 1) Squalius carolitertii, Achondrostoma oligolepis, Luciobarbus bocagei and Pseudochomdrostoma polylepis followed a southward route from Mondego to the West region; 2) Squalius pyrenaicus, Iberochondrostoma lusitanicum, Luciobarbus bocagei and Pseudochomdrostoma polylepis followed a West-Northwestward route from Tejo to the West region. Thus, L. bocagei and P. polylepis colonized both ends of the West region by distinct routes. Cyprinids from the West region display low intra-population variability and moderate to low levels of molecular diversity, which are lower than those found in neighbour river basins. Intrinsic drivers related to the life-history traits of the species may explain the different genetic variations found between sympatric species. On the contrary, the distinct levels of intra-population variability detected for each species could be explained by the different effect of extrinsic drivers due to the different geomorphological characteristics of each river basin. Thus, the observed patterns suggest the presence of accumulated differences within each population, reflecting their unique evolutionary histories as primary freshwater fish, which are intimately related to the evolution of paleobasins and geomorphological rearrangements of the West region. As such, all populations must be viewed as independent conservation units. Conservation plans should target A. occidentale. I. lusitanicum, S. pyrenaicus and A. oligolepis populations, by this order of priority, and ideally should include speciesspecific measures. Future management plans concerning the West region should include global measures such as preventing the discharge of pollutants, limiting water abstraction during the summer, restoring fluvial connectivity, eradicating invasive fauna and flora and habitat rehabilitation, while avoiding translocations at all cost.\nKey words: Conservation genetics; Cyprinids; Portuguese West region; Mitochondrial cytochrome b gene; Evolutionary Significant Units.\nResumo alargado\nA ictiofauna dul\u00e7aqu\u00edcola \u00e9 um dos grupos taxon\u00f3micos mais amea\u00e7ados \u00e0 escala global, enfrentando um acentuado decr\u00e9scimo de diversidade gen\u00e9tica particularmente durante as \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas. Esta problem\u00e1tica encontra-se principalmente associada \u00e0 press\u00e3o antropog\u00e9nica crescente sobre os sistemas dulciaqu\u00edcolas, nomeadamente atrav\u00e9s de press\u00f5es como a polui\u00e7\u00e3o, a degrada\u00e7\u00e3o e fragmenta\u00e7\u00e3o de habitats, a prolifera\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies invasoras, a capta\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua e a regula\u00e7\u00e3o de caudais. O mesmo acontece com as comunidades ictiofaun\u00edsticas dos rios da Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica, onde 70-80% das esp\u00e9cies foram classificadas como vulner\u00e1veis, em perigo ou criticamente em perigo de extin\u00e7\u00e3o.\nOs ciprin\u00eddeos s\u00e3o a fam\u00edlia de peixes de \u00e1gua doce com maior distribui\u00e7\u00e3o a n\u00edvel global, sendo tamb\u00e9m o grupo mais abundante na Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica. Sendo peixes prim\u00e1rios, a sua dispers\u00e3o s\u00f3 poder\u00e1 ter ocorrido atrav\u00e9s de contactos ancestrais entre bacias hidrogr\u00e1ficas atualmente independentes, como as capturas fluviais nas zonas de cabeceiras e a conflu\u00eancia de fozes, estando a sua hist\u00f3ria evolutiva estreitamente relacionada com a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o paleogeomorfol\u00f3gica de cada regi\u00e3o. A Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica foi colonizada por linhagens ancestrais de ciprin\u00eddeos durante o Oligoc\u00e9nico que conseguiram ultrapassar as barreiras naturais existentes antes da eleva\u00e7\u00e3o da Cordilheira dos Pirin\u00e9us estar completa. As bacias endorreicas existentes nesta \u00e9poca, atrav\u00e9s de v\u00e1rios rearranjos geomorfol\u00f3gicos, originaram a atual recente rede hidrogr\u00e1fica e permitiram a dispers\u00e3o de ciprin\u00eddeos por toda a Pen\u00ednsula. Atualmente, a Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica alberga uma grande variedade de esp\u00e9cies de ciprin\u00eddeos com pequenas \u00e1reas de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o e um grande n\u00famero de esp\u00e9cies end\u00e9micas.\nA regi\u00e3o Oeste de Portugal inclui v\u00e1rias bacias hidrogr\u00e1ficas independentes e de pequenas dimens\u00f5es, confinadas pelas cadeias montanhosas Sic\u00f3-Aire-Candeeiros, Montejunto e Sintra e as bacias hidrogr\u00e1ficas dos rios Mondego e Tejo. Devido \u00e0 elevada ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o humana, \u00e0 industrializa\u00e7\u00e3o e \u00e0 atividade agr\u00edcola, o contexto desta regi\u00e3o pode ser considerado como preocupante para as popula\u00e7\u00f5es das esp\u00e9cies nativas de ciprin\u00eddeos. Como tal, e tendo em conta que alguns aspetos gen\u00e9ticos destas popula\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o desconhecidos, a regi\u00e3o Oeste constitui um caso de estudo interessante no \u00e2mbito da gen\u00e9tica aplicada \u00e0 conserva\u00e7\u00e3o da biodiversidade.\nO objetivo principal desta tese era fornecer informa\u00e7\u00e3o gen\u00e9tica e biogeogr\u00e1fica \u00fatil para uma gest\u00e3o e conserva\u00e7\u00e3o mais eficientes das esp\u00e9cies nativas de ciprin\u00eddeos que ocorrem na regi\u00e3o Oeste de Portugal. Para tal, estimou-se a diversidade gen\u00e9tica de cada popula\u00e7\u00e3o e os tempos de diverg\u00eancia entre popula\u00e7\u00f5es, e reconstituiram-se as hist\u00f3rias evolutivas das popula\u00e7\u00f5es, relacionando-as com a paleogeomorfologia da regi\u00e3o. Com base nestes elementos, teceram-se considera\u00e7\u00f5es acerca do que podem ser consideradas unidades de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e unidades evolutivas significativas (ESUs) e sugeriram-se futuras linhas de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o e medidas mitigadoras no \u00e2mbito da conserva\u00e7\u00e3o de peixes de \u00e1gua doce.\nO estudo incidiu sobre as 7 esp\u00e9cies de ciprin\u00eddeos nativos que ocorrem na regi\u00e3o do Oeste, designadamente, Iberochondrostoma lusitanicum (Collares-Pereira, 1980), Achondrostoma occidentale (Robalo, Almada, Sousa-Santos, Moreira e Doadrio 2005), Achondrostoma oligolepis (Robalo, Doadrio, Almada e Kottelat, 2005), Squalius pyrenaicus (G\u00fcnther, 1868), Squalius carolitertii (Doadrio, 1988), Pseudochondrostoma polylepis (Steindachner, 1864) e Luciobarbus bocagei (Steindachner, 1864). O trabalho foi desenvolvido em 14 bacias hidrogr\u00e1ficas, nomeadamente Lis, S\u00e3o Pedro, Alcoa, Tornada, Real, Alcabrichel, Sizandro, Safarujo, Lizandro, Colares, Lage, Ossos e Jamor. Para atingir os objetivos propostos, usou-se o gene mitocondrial citocromo b e, em alguns casos particulares, o gene nuclear da beta-actina, ambos amplificados a partir de ADN extra\u00eddo da barbatana dorsal de aproximadamente 20 indiv\u00edduos de cada esp\u00e9cie e de cada bacia. Para fins comparativos, e de modo a reconstituir a coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o da regi\u00e3o Oeste, foram ainda analisadas amostras das bacias hidrogr\u00e1ficas vizinhas, dos rios\nMondego, Tejo e Sado. As amostras de barbatana utilizadas foram recolhidas atrav\u00e9s de pesca el\u00e9trica, em opera\u00e7\u00f5es realizadas no \u00e2mbito do projeto FISHATLAS e desta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o.\nAs an\u00e1lises gen\u00e9ticas baseadas nos tempos de diverg\u00eancia obtidos para o gene to citocromo b sugerem que os ciprin\u00eddeos nativos colonizaram a regi\u00e3o Oeste muito recentemente, durante o Holoc\u00e9nico, posteriormente \u00e0s \u00faltimas grandes glacia\u00e7\u00f5es, atrav\u00e9s de conex\u00f5es com as bacias vizinhas do Mondego e Tejo. De acordo com os padr\u00f5es observados, a explica\u00e7\u00e3o mais plaus\u00edvel para a coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o desta regi\u00e3o integra duas rotas de coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o distintas: 1) S. carolitertii, A. oligolepis, L. bocagei e P. polylepis chegaram \u00e0 regi\u00e3o atrav\u00e9s do Mondego, utilizando uma rota no sentido norte-sul e 2) S. pyrenaicus, I. lusitanicum, L. bocagei e P. polylepis entraram na regi\u00e3o a partir do Tejo, utilizando uma rota no sentido este-oeste/noroeste. De acordo com este cen\u00e1rio, L. bocagei e P. polylepis colonizaram os extremos opostos da regi\u00e3o Oeste por duas rotas distintas, atrav\u00e9s do Mondego e do Tejo.\nAs popula\u00e7\u00f5es de ciprin\u00eddeos da regi\u00e3o Oeste exibem baixa a moderada variabilidade intrapopulacional, inferior \u00e0 encontrada nas popula\u00e7\u00f5es das grandes bacias vizinhas do Mondego, Tejo e Sado. Esta baixa diversidade parece corroborar a recente coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o mas pode tamb\u00e9m ser o resultado de sucessivos efeitos gargalo causados por transgress\u00f5es marinhas ou por eventos recentes, como as descargas de poluentes e as secas estivais c\u00edclicas, que tendencialmente podem reduzir o tamanho das popula\u00e7\u00f5es de cada esp\u00e9cie.\nAs varia\u00e7\u00f5es observadas entre popula\u00e7\u00f5es da mesma esp\u00e9cie em diferentes bacias sugerem que a diversidade gen\u00e9tica pode ser condicionada por fatores extr\u00ednsecos \u00e0 esp\u00e9cie, nomeadamente pelas condi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais a que as popula\u00e7\u00f5es est\u00e3o sujeitas e que podem variar consideravelmente entre bacias. Por outro lado, esp\u00e9cies que ocorrem nas mesmas bacias apresentam diferen\u00e7as no que diz respeito \u00e0 diversidade gen\u00e9tica, o que parece apontar para a eventual exist\u00eancia de condicionalismos intr\u00ednsecos \u00e0 esp\u00e9cie, nomeadamente o tempo de gera\u00e7\u00e3o, o tamanho corporal e a capacidade migrat\u00f3ria.\nNo geral, e apesar da coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o muito recente, os padr\u00f5es gen\u00e9ticos observados evidenciam a acumula\u00e7\u00e3o de diferen\u00e7as em cada popula\u00e7\u00e3o, reflexo do isolamento a que ficaram sujeitas e, provavelmente, da adapta\u00e7\u00e3o a condi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais espec\u00edficas de cada bacia. De facto, por se tratar de peixes prim\u00e1rios e por isso intolerantes \u00e0 \u00e1gua salgada, a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o das esp\u00e9cies estudadas \u00e9 similar \u00e0 das esp\u00e9cies confinadas a ilhas: a partir do momento em que uma bacia se torna independente, os peixes que nela ocorrem deixam de trocar genes com outras popula\u00e7\u00f5es e passam a acumular muta\u00e7\u00f5es pr\u00f3prias, iniciando uma hist\u00f3ria evolutiva exclusiva.\nAssim, para prop\u00f3sitos de gest\u00e3o e conserva\u00e7\u00e3o, as popula\u00e7\u00f5es de ciprin\u00eddeos da regi\u00e3o Oeste devem ser consideradas como unidades evolutivas significativas e geridas independentemente como unidades de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o distintas, com medidas espec\u00edficas de acordo com a esp\u00e9cie e a bacia em quest\u00e3o. No entanto, n\u00e3o sendo poss\u00edvel englobar todas as popula\u00e7\u00f5es em planos de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e gest\u00e3o, algumas devem ser consideradas priorit\u00e1rias. Assim, considerando as an\u00e1lises gen\u00e9ticas obtidas para as sete esp\u00e9cies estudadas, sugere-se que deve ser dada elevada prioridade \u00e0 conserva\u00e7\u00e3o das popula\u00e7\u00f5es de A. occidentale, uma vez que a esp\u00e9cie tem uma \u00e1rea de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o muito reduzida e estas popula\u00e7\u00f5es ter\u00e3o resultado de um processo de vicari\u00e2ncia antigo. Numa segunda linha de prioridade, devem ser consideradas as popula\u00e7\u00f5es de I. lusitanicum e S. pyrenaicus devido aos seus elevados estatutos de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e por serem as \u00fanicas popula\u00e7\u00f5es destas esp\u00e9cies que n\u00e3o ocorrem em grandes bacias, representando assim as orlas das respetivas radia\u00e7\u00f5es. Em terceiro lugar, devem ainda ser consideradas as popula\u00e7\u00f5es de A. oligolepis pela sua elevada diverg\u00eancia em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 fonte de coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o.\nA utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de transloca\u00e7\u00f5es de indiv\u00edduos como medida de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 frequentemente controversa. De acordo com os resultados deste trabalho, as transloca\u00e7\u00f5es devem ser evitadas a todo o custo\nprincipalmente por implicarem a mistura de unidades evolutivas significativas diferentes e a consequente perda da integridade gen\u00e9tica das popula\u00e7\u00f5es. Alternativamente, o refor\u00e7o de popula\u00e7\u00f5es com indiv\u00edduos produzidos em cativeiro a partir de reprodutores selvagens provenientes da bacia em quest\u00e3o poder\u00e1 ser uma boa ferramenta para aumentar o tamanho efetivo das popula\u00e7\u00f5es e assim reduzir o seu risco de extin\u00e7\u00e3o.

Without conservation genetics, an unappropriated management and allocation of resources can occur (Frankham, 2003, 2005). However, its application in the management of threatened species is still far from being common (Frankham, 2010).\nThe application of genetics is crucial to resolve taxonomic uncertainties, detect hybridization and gene flow, identify distinct populations and determine if the populations are genetically healthy (e.g. DeSalle and Amato, 2004; Frankham, 2010; Allendorf et al., 2010; Frankham et al., 2010). These applications provide information that allow the identification of relevant populations for conservation purposes and the definition of evolutionary significant units (ESUs), which are indispensable due to the current high number of vulnerable species (e.g. DeSalle and Amato, 2004; Allendorf et al., 2010; Frankham et al.,\n2010)\t. Evolutionary significant units (ESUs) are populations that have a high priority for separate conservation (Frankham et al., 2010) and, according to Moritz (1994), should be defined based on the historical population structure and mtDNA phylogeny, to achieve their long-term conservation.\nThe genetic characterization of populations and the determination of conservation units are particularly important in management projects that imply conservation efforts such as translocation, captive breeding, and reintroductions (Moritz, 1999; Weeks etal., 2011). They provide valuable information to the prevention of outbreeding depression risks and the preservation of specific population characteristics that could reflect adaptation to different environmental conditions (Frankham etal., 2010; Weeks etal.,\n2011)\t.\nFreshwater fish are a good example of the need to use genetic data for conservation purposes. Fish populations are often highly fragmented, mainly due to habitat loss and damming, and are expected to vary among basins reflecting adaptations to the local environment (Frankham et al., 2010). Thus, although challenging, the management of imperiled freshwater fish species may largely benefit from the data retrieved from conservation genetics approaches.\n1.2\tEuropean and Iberian colonizations by Cyprinid fishes\nThe Cyprinidae is one of the most successful and widespread families of freshwater fish, with more than 367 genera and 3006 species distributed throughout Eurasia, North America and Africa (Nelson et al., 2016).\nCyprinids are primary fish (Fenolio et al., 2013; Nelson et al., 2016) intolerant to marine salinity that are, thus, restricted to river basins and incapable of migrate between disconnected ones or through the sea (Darlington, 1957; Sousa-Santos et al., 2016). Thereby, the evolutionary history of cyprinids is highly related to connections and disconnections between river basins associated with geomorphological rearrangements, which were responsible, respectively, for gene flow and isolation of populations (e.g. Aboim et al., 2013; Sousa-Santos et al., 2014a and Sousa-Santos et al., 2014b). This has already prompted several studies combining genetic and geological dating (e.g. Marchordom and Doadrio, 2001; Durand et al., 2002; Kotlik et al., 2008; Houston et al., 2010; Sousa-Santos et al., 2014a, 2014b; Perea\net al., 2016) and highlights the need to use data on the geomorphological evolution to understand the evolution of cyprinids.\nPhylogenetic studies revealed that cyprinids originated in Asia, where there is the highest number of species, and that most of the North American, African and European species seem to have derived from Asiatic lineages (Robalo etal., 2007; Levy etal., 2009).\nEurope was only colonized by cyprinids in the Oligocene (Briggs, 1995), when the drought of the Turgai Sea allowed the connection with Asia (Levy et al., 2009). Two main hypotheses are recurrently considered to explain the colonization and radiation of cyprinids across European rivers. One hypothesis is that Europe was gradually colonized as a result of river captures from the Oligocene until the Pliocene (35.0-1.7Ma), with fish reaching the Iberian Peninsula before the formation of the Pyrenees and the intensification of the alpine orogeny, in the Miocene (reviewed by Levy et al., 2009). The other hypothesis is that the dispersal of cyprinids occurred through the Mediterranean sea during the Lago Mare phase, in the Messinian (5.5Ma), in the end of the salinity crises (Krijgsman et al., 1999) when Parathetys, a central European lake, drained to the Mediterranean basin that was dried because of the isolation from the Atlantic and the decrease of rainfall (Bianco et al., 1990). This hypothesis is supported by evidence indicating that some cyprinids, as Luciobarbus, have more affinity with North African species than with central European species (e.g. Tsigenopoulos et al., 2003; Gante et al., 2009). However, besides the Lago Mare phase, the Iberian Peninsula and Africa were connected in other episodes, and river captures can have occurred between them, as well as coastal diffusion caused by a decrease in the sea level (Levy et al., 2009, Doadrio et al., 2011). Both hypotheses can be complementary in explaining the colonization of the Iberian Peninsula by cyprinids (reviewed by Levy et al., 2009 and by Perea et al., 2010).\nCurrently, two distinct groups of cyprinids are found in Europe: one in Central Europe, with a low number of widespread species, and the other in the Mediterranean Peninsulas, with a high number of species of few genera, with small geographic ranges and high levels of endemism. One possible explanation for these two patterns is that, in the last glaciation, the meridional peninsulas have constituted a refuge for freshwater fishes, from where colonizers of only a few number of species radiated to Central Europe after the end of the glaciation (Banarescu, 1992; Taberlet et al., 1998; Hewitt, 1999; Nesbo et al., 1999; Robalo et al., 2007 and Doadrio et al., 2011).\nThe Iberian Peninsula is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean and the Pyrenees and this isolation results in a somewhat insular character of the Iberian freshwater fish fauna. Moreover, the Iberian Peninsula has been colonized only by a small number of fish lineages that were able to surpass the natural barriers existent in the Oligocene, before the complete elevation of the Pyrenean Mountains (Doadrio et al., 2011). In fact, the oldest cyprinid fossil known in the Iberian Peninsula is from Rutilus antiquus, dated from the Upper Oligocene, and was found in the Ebro basin, in the eastern margin of the Peninsula (reviewed by Levy et al., 2009).\nSince the beginning of the colonization of the Iberian Peninsula, several modifications have occurred in its hydrographic network (Andeweg, 2002). In the Miocene, the Iberian hydrographic network was formed by a large number of inland lakes that did not drained to the sea (Andeweg, 2002; Pais et al., 2012; Figure 1-1). These endorheic basins were captured by the fluvial network between the Late Miocene and the Pliocene (Casas-Sainz and De Vicent, 2009), with the formation of the Iberian Central Massif during the Miocene, which resulted in the separation of Northern and Southern river basins -(Aboim et al., 2013).\nFigure 1-1: The evolution of the Miocene inland lakes (adapted from Sousa-Santos, 2007)\nNonetheless, the system only began to be exorheic in the Neogene, as a result of the combination of the alpine orogeny activity, with the Iberian Peninsula tilting towards the Atlantic (Sousa-Santos et al., 2007), and climate constrains (Casas-Sainz and De Vicent, 2009). Regressive erosion could also have been linked to the endorheic-exorheic transition (Casas-Sainz and De Vicent, 2009) with the formation of large fluvial valleys and several endorheic basins captures (Cunha and Martins, 2004). Thus, the current Iberian fluvial network is very recent, of Plio-Pleistocene origin (Andeweg, 2002).\nThe last glacial maximum (LGM) culminated between 23.000 and 18.000 years ago (Jones and Mann, 2003), in the Late Pleistocene. At this time, the polar front reached the Northern Portugal latitude (Dias et al., 2000), most of the Portuguese continental shelf was above sea level, and the confluence of some rivers was possible, especially between the Minho and Ave basins and in the vicinity of the Nazar\u00e9 submarine canyon (Rodrigues and Dias, 1989). Moreover, several submarine canyons formed in the Pliocene (such as the Nazar\u00e9 and Cascais submarine canyons), as a consequence of glacio-eustatic variations (Alves et al., 2003), could have acted as isolation barriers during marine regressions and, thus, could have promoted the differentiation of populations separated by them, as already suggested for lampreys (Mateus et al. 2013). Between 13.000 and 11.000 years ago, the sea level rose rapidly and flooded the fluvial valleys (Cunha and Gouveia, 2015; Figure 1-2), which consequently dug the headwaters of the rivers. The current sea level was only reached approximately 3.500 years ago, after the Flandrian transgression (Teixeira and Gon\u00e7alves, 1980; Dias etal., 2000; Cunha and Gouveia, 2015; Figure 1-2).\nFigure 1-2: Portuguese coastal evolution since the LGM (Dias et al., 2000).\nThus, ancient freshwater fish lineages most likely colonized the different river basins in the Iberian Peninsula through connections between the inland lakes and, afterwards, through connections between the established river basins (e.g. Sousa-Santos etal., 2007; Perea etal., 2015). These connections could have resulted from fluvial captures of headwaters, confluence of river mouths during regressions and connections between previously existent coastal lagoons (Figure 1-3).\nFigure 1-3: Coastal lagons of Pederneira, Alfeizer\u00e3o and \u00d3bidos at 2000 years B.C. (author: Joaquim Pereira da Silva; date:1982)\nAfter each river basin became independent from the neighbour basins, primary fish populations also became isolated and evolved without further gene interchange with other populations.\n1.3\tPortuguese West region\nThe Portuguese West region is located between the Mondego and Tejo river basins and is considered the westernmost tip of the European continent. Nowadays, the West region is composed by approximately 20 small independent coastal river basins, some of them (from Lis to Real) previously connected by coastal lagoons (Figure 1-3). These river basins were colonized by cyprinids through connections with other river basins, following the processes above mentioned for the radiation of freshwater fish throughout the Iberian Peninsula.\nThe cyprinid species which occur in these region are relatively well known, including the phylogenetic relationships with close related species (for more detailed information see section 3). However, the species genetic structuration and their evolutionary history are still unclarified, namely concerning the colonization routes followed by the fish lineages and the eventual role of the three mountains ranges surrounding the Western rivers (Sic\u00f3-Aire-Candeeiros, Montejunto and Sintra) in the isolation and evolution of fish populations.\nConsidered the most populated region in the Portuguese Coast, the West region is highly industrialized. Thus, the environment is under severe anthropogenic pressure, particularly freshwater habitats.\nPollution and habitat degradation and fragmentation are the main consequences of this pressure, constituting major threats for the cyprinids and other freshwater fauna in the region.\nThus, since this region has several small river basins which are under high pressure and there is still a knowledge gap concerning some genetic aspects of the inhabitant cyprinid species, most of them imperiled, the West region configures an interesting geographical area to be studied from a conservation genetics perspective.\n1.4\tObjectives\nThe main goal of this thesis was to provide genetic and biogeographic data which can be useful for a more efficient conservation management of native cyprinid fish species from the Portuguese West region. To achieve this, the specific aims of this work were to:\n1.\tEstimate the genetic diversity of cyprinid populations from the study area;\n2.\tEstimate divergence times among cyprinid populations from the study area and between those populations and the ones from the neighbour river basins;\n3.\tReconstitute the evolutionary history of the cyprinid species from the study area and relate them with the paleogeomorphological evolution of the region;\n4.\tDesignate units of conservation and evolutionary significant units (ESUs) for native cyprinids and highlight future concerns for freshwater fish conservation.\n2.\tSTUDY AREA\nThe studied area is confined by two large river basins, the River Mondego in the north and the River Tejo in the south, and by three mountain ranges: Sico-Aire-Candeeiros, Montejunto and Sintra (Figure 2-1). In administrative terms, this coastal area in central Portugal includes all municipalities between Leiria and Oeiras, from Leiria and Lisbon districts. To simplify, henceforth, the studied area will be referred as the West region.\n1\t- Lis\n2\t- S\u00e3o Pedro\n3\t- Alcoa\n4\t- Tornada\n5\t- Real\n6\t- Alcabrichel\n7\t- Sizandro\n8\t- Safarujo\n9\t- Lizandro\n10\t- Samarra\n11\t- Colares\n12\t- Lage\n13\t- Ossos\n14\t- Jamor\n15\t- Mondego\n16\t- Tejo\n17\t- Sado\n18\t- Sic\u00f3-Aire-Candeeiros\n19\t- Montejunto\n20\t- Sintra\n1213H1\n0\t20 km\nFigure 2-1: The Portuguese West region, including the river basins analyzed in this study (1-17) and the three mountain ranges of the region (18-20).\nThis is a region of extreme geological importance, mainly formed by limestone and with a complex network of subterranean karst caves (Cunha, 1990), which corresponds to the ancient Lusitanian basin formed in the beginning of the Alpine orogeny, during the Mesozoic (Kullberg et al., 2013). Since that time, the region suffered many geological changes and the hydrographical network configuration changed accordingly (Pais et al., 2012; for more details see section 1.2). Currently, the West region comprises approximately 20 small sized independent river basins, 14 of which still harbour native freshwater ichthyofauna (Figure 2-1; Ribeiro etal., 2007).\nThe climate in the West region is Atlantic-humid (precipitation >2800 mm/yr; Feio et al., 2009). However, in drier years, some of the streams are reduced to small disconnected pools that act as faunal refugia for fish (Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2002). The congregation of fish in these pools increase the predation, the competition for the limited space and food resources and mainly in the smallest pools, the fish are subject to hypoxia, hyperthermia and higher probability of being affected by infectious diseases (e.g. Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2002; Magoulick and Kobza, 2003; Dekar and Magoulick, 2007).\nCurrently, only the River S\u00e3o Pedro (Figure 2-1) is categorized as having good ecological quality, in the frame of the Water Framework Directive. The remainder of the rivers in this region have statuses inferior than good (Ag\u00eancia Portuguesa do Ambiente, I.P.,\t2016 available in:\n<http: //sniamb.apambiente.pt/pgrh/>).\nFreshwater fish assemblages in the West region include eight native species, including seven cyprinids (see section 3) and the cobitid Cobitis paludica. Besides that, at least five exotic species occur in the region: Carassius auratus in Lis, Tornada, Real and Lizandro; Lepomis gibbosus in Lis, S. Pedro and Lizandro; Gambusia holbrooki in Lis and Real; Cyprinus carpio in Lis, Lizandro and Colares and Micropterus salmoides in Lizandro (Ribeiro et al., 2007).\n3.\tSTUDY SPECIES\nThis work focused in the seven cyprinid species occurring in the West region: Iberochondrostoma lusitanicum (Collares-Pereira, 1980), Achondrostoma occidentale (Robalo, Almada, Sousa-Santos, Moreira &amp; Doadrio 2005), Achondrostoma oligolepis (Robalo, Doadrio, Almada &amp; Kottelat, 2005), Squalius pyrenaicus (Gunther, 1868), Squalius carolitertii (Doadrio, 1988), Pseudochondrostoma polylepis (Steindachner, 1864) and Luciobarbus bocagei (Steindachner, 1864). The distribution of each species across river basins in the West region is shown in Table 3-1.\nTable 3-1: Cyprinid species occurring in the West region river basins.\n\tL. bocagei\t5. carolitertii\t5. pyrenaicus\tA.

Maximum body length and longevity is found for L. bocagei (100cm and 11 years; Ribeiro etal., 2007). In contrast, the Portuguese endemisms A. occidentale, A. oligolepis and I. lusitanicum show the smallest body lenghts (<15 cm) and the minimum longevity was described for I. lusitanicum (4 years; Ribeiro et al., 2007). P. polylepis and both Squalius species are considered as medium size cyprinids (<40 and&lt;26 cm, respectively).\nAll species spawn from April to June (Carmona and Doadrio, 2000; Robalo et al., 2008) and at least I. lusitanicum, A. occidentale and P. polylepis spawn in groups, laying adhesive eggs (e.g. Doadrio et al., 2011). P. polylepis and L. bocagei are potamodromous species that migrate in the beginning of the reproductive season to spawn upstream (Kottelat and Freyhof, 2007; Mateus et al., 2008).\nAs mentioned above, the phylogenetic relationships of the species occurring in the West region with their congeners are known, as well as the estimated times of divergence between species (summarized in Figure 3-3).\nFigure 3-2: Diagrams summarizing the phylogenies of Iberian Iberochondrostoma species (adaptedfrom Robalo, 2007 and\nGante et al., 2010); Achondrostoma species (adapted from Robalo et al., 2006a); Squalius (adaptedfrom Almada and Sousa-Santos, 2010); Pseudochondrostoma species (adaptedfrom Doadrio and Carmona, 2004 and Aboim et al., 2013) and Luciobarbus species (adaptedfrom Gante et al., 2009).\n4.\tMETHODS\n4.1\tFish Sampling\nFish were sampled in the 14 river basins of the Western region harbouring cyprinids and in the three neighbour river basins (Mondego, Tejo and Sado) for comparison purposes. To simplify, and since all river basins are independent, throughout the text, the term \u201cpopulation\u201d will be used to designate the individuals of the same species from the same river basin.\nMost of the samples were previously obtained under the scope of the FISHATLAS project (FCT funded; PTDC/AAC-CLI/103110/2008) and were available at the MARE-ISPA research unit. However, in order to obtain a complete dataset of 20 individuals for each population (Table 5-1, section 5), additional sampling was conducted between September and December of 2015. In all cases, fish were sampled by electrofishing, using a SAMUS\u00ae portable device (500V impulses, with frequency and duration selected according to the water conductivity). Fish were maintained in aerated buckets and, after the removal of a dorsal fin clip (non-destructive sampling), they were safely returned to the river course.\n4.2\tDNA extraction, amplification and sequencing\nDNA was extracted from fin clips (one per individual), previously preserved in ethanol, using the REDExtract-N-Amp Tissue PCR kit by Sigma-Aldrich\u00ae. Each fin clip was incubated with extraction and preparation solutions (100 pl and 25 pl, respectively) at 55\u00b0C for 10 minutes and subsequently at 95\u00b0C for 3 minutes. In the end of the cycle, a neutralization buffer (100 pl) was added.\nOne mitochondrial (cytochrome b) and one nuclear gene (beta-actin) were amplified by PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) using the primers LCB1-ACTTGAAGAACCACCGTTG (Sousa-Santos et al., 2016) and HA-CAACGATCTCCGGTTTACAAGAC (Schmidt and Gold, 1993) for cytb and BactFor-ATGGATGATGAAATTGCCGC and BactRev-AGGATCTTCATGAGGTAGTC (Robalo et al., 2006b) for beta-actin. Tissue extracts (4 pl) were mixed with ultrapure water (4.4 pl), REDExtract-N-Amp PCR Reaction Mix (10 pl, Sigma-Aldrich\u00ae) and forward and reverse primers (0.8 pl each). PCR conditions were the following: 94\u00b0C for 3 min + 35x[94\u00b0C 1 min + 50\u00b0C 1 min 30 s + 72\u00b0C 1 min 30 s] + 72\u00b0C 10 min for cytb, and 94\u00b0C for 3 min + 35x[94\u00b0C 1 min + 55\u00b0C 1min30 s + 72\u00b0C 1 min 30 s] + 72\u00b0C 10 min for beta-actin.\nPCR products were purified and sequenced at GATC (Konstanz, Germany) using the forward primers LCB1 and BactFor. DNA sequencing was only conducted for the species which showed variation at the mitochondrial DNA level and, thus, for which the data obtained with the slower paced beta-actin gene could be informative.\n4.3\tDNA analysis\nObtained sequences were aligned and edited with CodonCode Aligner v.4.0.4 (Codoncode Corp., USA) and trimmed at the 3' and 5 ' ends so they had the same length. Sequences from heterozygous individuals for the beta-actin gene were manually phased using the procedures described by Sousa-Santos et al. (2005). Edited sequences were collapsed into haplotypes using DNA-colapser (FaBox v.1.41; available online at&lt;http://www.birc.au.dk/software/fabox>).\nThe haplotype networks were computed using statistical parsimony based on a 95% confidence interval (TCS 1.21 software; Clement et al., 2000). Haplotype classification, allowing the visualization of population correspondences and the relative haplotype frequencies as pie-chart like graphs, and layout\nimprovements were conducted using tcsBU (Santos et al., 2015) and Inkscape v.0.48.4 softwares, respectively.\nThe ARLEQUIN software package v.3.5 (Excoffier and Lischer, 2010), henceforth designated as ARLEQUIN, was used to estimate molecular diversity indices (h, gene diversity; n, nucleotide diversity and k, mean number of pairwise differences), corrected population pairwise differences, and the number of migrants (M=Nm) between populations.\nGenetic divergence between populations was calculated with the fixation index Ost (Tamura-Nei model, 2000 permutations), implemented in ARLEQUIN. Estimates of the divergence time based on the cytb gene were calculated using an evolutionary rate of 1.05% sequence divergence per million years (MY), as suggested by Dowling et al. (2002) for North American cyprinids. Molecular variance analyses (AMOVA) and mismatch distributions (Rogers and Harpending, 1992) were also computed in ARLEQUIN.\nThe parameters 00 and 01, M and t, and and their confidence intervals were obtained by a parametric bootstrap approach using 10.000 replicates. Fu's Fs (Fu, 1997) and Tajima's D (Tajima, 1989) tests (based in 10.000 replicates) were performed using ARLEQUIN. For populations presenting deviations from mutation-drift equilibrium (i.e. showing negative and significant Tajima's D at p &lt;0.05; negative and significant Fu's Fs at p &lt;0.02; and non-significant Harpending's Raggedness p-values), it was determined the effective population sizes before (N0) and after (N1) a sudden expansion event, the effective population size prior to a spatial expansion event (N), the time since the expansion (t; in years), and the migration rate (M=2Nm), using the equations r=2pt and 0=2Np. To this end, we calculated the total mutation rate per sequence per generation (p) considering the 1.05%/My divergence rate (0.0053 x 10-6 substitutions/lineage/year) of the cytb gene estimated by Dowling et al. (2002), as before. According to the generation time known for each species, distinct mutations rates were calculated: 2.27 x 10-5 for L. bocagei (5.25x10-9 x 720 nucleotides x generation time of 6 years; Doadrio et al., 2011); 7.56 x 10-6 for A. oligolepis and A. occidentale (5.25x10-9 x 720 nucleotides x generation time of 2 years; it was assumed that they have the same generation time as their congener A. arcasii, Doadrio et al., 2011), 7.56 x 10-6 for I. lusitanicum (5.25x10-9 x 720 nucleotides x generation time of 2 years; it was assumed that it has the same generation as its congener I. lemmingii, Ribeiro et al., 2007), 1.32 x 10-5 for .S'. pyrenaicus and .S'. carolitertii (5.25x10-9 x 720 nucleotides x generation time of 3.5 years; Rodrigues, 1999), and 1.32 x 10-5 for P. polylepis (5.25x10-9 x 720 nucleotides generation time of 3.5 years; Doadrio et al., 2011). To evaluate the goodness-of-fit between the observed and the model frequency distributions, the sum of squared deviations (SSD) of the observed data related to the model and the Harpending's Raggedness indexes (and their respective p values based on 10.000 replicates) were calculated using ARLEQUIN.\nA slower paced molecular marker (beta-actin gene) was used to search for shared haplotypes and infer more ancient genealogical relationships in A. oligolepis, S. pyrenicus and S. carolitertii species. Betaactin sequences were not considered for A. occidentale populations since its phylogenetically closest relative, Achondrostoma arcasii (Robalo etal., 2006a), is absent in the geographical vicinity of the study area, preventing the determination of the colonization routes followed towards the West region. Also, since .S'. pyrenaicus and .S'. carolitertii are not distinguishable species at the beta-actin gene level (Almada and Sousa-Santos, 2010), Squalius populations from the West region were compared with congeners from the river basins of Mondego, Tejo, and Sado.\n5.\tRESULTS\nThe species composition of most of the river basins prospected during this thesis was already known and published (Ribeiro etal., 2007, available in:&lt;http://www.cartapiscicola.org/> and Sousa-Santos et al., 2013, available in:&lt;http://www.fishatlas.net/>). However, the occurrences of S. pyrenaicus in the Lis and Lage basins and P. polylepis in the Colares basin are described here for the first time (Table 51).\nThe complete dataset consisted of 2418 sequences, including 2043 sequences (720 bp) of the cytb gene and 375 sequences of the beta-actin gene (935 and 905 bp for Squalius and Achondrostoma oligolepis, respectively) (Table 5-1). This included a set of sequences for the populations from the West region (561 cytb and 135 beta-actin sequences) and another set for the populations from the Neighbour river basins (1482 cytb and 240 beta-actin sequences). The total number of sequences used per population, for each molecular marker, is presented in Table 5-1.\nTable 5-1: Number of DNA sequences by gene fragment and population.\n\tL. bocagei\tS. carolitertii\t\tS. pyrenaicus\t\tA. oligolepis\t\tA. occidentale\tP. polylepis\tI. lusitanicum\tTotal\t\n\tCytb\tCytb\tBact\tCytb\tBact\tCytb\tBact\tCytb\tCytb\tCytb\tCytb\tBact\nWestern '\t\t\t\t\t\tjasins\t\t\t\t\t\t\nLis\t20\t\t\t20\t6\t20\t12\t\t19\t\t79\t18\nS\u00e3o Pedro\t\t\t\t\t\t20\t9\t\t\t\t20\t9\nAlcoa\t20\t20\t13\t\t\t20\t6\t\t20\t\t80\t19\nTornada\t\t\t\t\t\t13\t12\t\t\t\t13\t12\nReal\t\t\t\t\t\t20\t4\t\t\t\t20\t4\nAlcabrichel\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t23\t\t\t23\t\nSizandro\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t27\t\t\t27\t\nSafarujo\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t21\t\t\t21\t\nLizandro\t20\t\t\t20\t17\t\t\t\t\t20\t60\t17\nSamarra\t\t\t\t20\t20\t\t\t\t\t19\t39\t20\nColares\t19\t\t\t21\t7\t\t\t\t16\t19\t75\t7\nLage\t\t\t\t20\t10\t\t\t\t\t23\t43\t10\nBarcarena\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t21\t21\t\nJamor\t\t\t\t20\t19\t\t\t\t\t20\t40\t19\nNeighbour Basins\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMondego\t110\t93\t90\t\t\t112\t19\t\t108\t\t423\t109\nTejo\t200\t\t\t150\t87\t21\t8\t\t192\t158\t721\t95\nSado\t158\t\t\t83\t36\t\t\t\t20\t77\t338\t36\nTotal\t547\t113\t103\t354\t202\t226\t70\t71\t375\t357\t2043\t375\nFor easy of comprehension, results will be presented independently for each species. The analyses will focus on the populations from the West region and will include comparisons with populations from Neighbour river basins. For simplicity, throughout the text, the terms \u201cWestern populations\u201d and \u201cNeighbour populations\u201d will be used to designate, respectively, the populations from river basins in the West region and the populations from Mondego, Tejo and Sado basins.\n5.1\tIberochondrostoma lusitanicum\nThe molecular diversity indices calculated for the Western populations of Iberochondrostoma lusitanicum and for the Neighbour populations from the Tejo and Sado basins are presented in Table 52. The mitochondrial cytb dataset for I. lusitanicum Western populations only comprised one haplotype and, consequently, the molecular diversity indices were null. Contrastingly, in the Neighbour populations of the Tejo and Sado basins high values of molecular diversity and higher number of haplotypes were found.\nTable 5-2: Molecular diversity indices for I. lusitanicum populations from the West region and Neighbour river basins.

The haplotype IL1, found in Western populations and distinct from the ancestral by three mutational steps, was the most frequent one, representing 40% of the individuals sampled, and was shared with individuals from the Tejo population. Contrastingly, most of the haplotypes found in the Sado population were distinct from the haplotypes found in the Western and Tejo populations by more than ten mutations.\nFigure 5-1: Haplotype network of I. lusitanicum populations from the West region and Neighbour rivers basins of Tejo and\nSado. *ancestral haplotype (outgroup weight=0.163)\nConsidering Tejo, Sado and Western populations as three distinct populations, AMOVA results showed higher variation among populations (84.02%; Va=3.646; p<0.001) than within populations (15.98%; Vb=0.693; p<0.001). The overall fixation index was high and significant (FST=0.840, p<0.001), indicating that the I. lusitanicum populations were highly structured. This was also corroborated by the significant, corrected pairwise differences between Western populations and both Neighbour populations (p<0.001) (Table 5-3).\nThe percentages of divergence and estimated times of divergence between Western and Neighbour populations of the Tejo and Sado basins were 0.30% and 1.80%, and 2461 and 17274 years, respectively (Table 5-3). As expected, the lowest divergence times were obtained between the Western and Tejo populations, which are geographically closer. However, low gene flow (M<1) was detected between Western and Neighbour populations (Table 9-16 section 9).\nTable 5-3: Relationships between I. lusitanicum populations from the West region and from the Neighbour populations of Tejo and Sado based on the average corrected pairwise distances between haplotypes.

The molecular diversity indices obtained for each population are presented in Table 5-4. The highest number of haplotypes (seven) and the highest values for the molecular diversity indices were found in the Alcabrichel population. By contrast, just one haplotype was found in the Sizandro population and, consequently, values of molecular diversity were null for all indices.\nTable 5-4: Molecular diversity indices for A. occidentale populations from the West region.

This structuring was also corroborated by the significant, corrected pairwise differences (p<0.001) between all pairs of populations (Table 5-5).\nRegarding divergence between populations, the Safarujo-Sizandro and Alcabrichel-Safarujo pairs showed, respectively, 0.40% and 0.30% of divergence, corresponding to divergence times of 3590 and 2819 years respectively (Table 5-5). The Sizandro and Safarujo were the closest populations, displaying the lowest percentage of divergence (0.03%) and the most recent estimated time of divergence (324 years) (Table 5-5).\nTable 5-5: Relationships between A. occidentale populations from the West region based on the average corrected pairwise distances between haplotypes.

The molecular diversity indices obtained for each population are presented in Table 5-6. Populations from the Alcoa and Tornada basins showed the lowest values for all molecular diversity indices, while the populations of the Lis, Real and S\u00e3o Pedro basins presented the highest ones Western populations showed three to seven haplotypes, most of them private, with the exception of the S\u00e3o Pedro population, with 100% of shared haplotypes.\nWhen compared to the Western populations, the Neighbour population of the Mondego basin showed an higher number of haplotypes and an higher genetic diversity. Conversely, the population of the Tejo basin showed similar number of haplotypes and gene diversity to the Western population of Tornada basin, but n and k values were higher than those showed by any Western population (Table 5-6).\nTable 5-6: Molecular diversity indices for A. oligolepis populations from the West region and Neighbour river basins.\nSample size (N); Number of haplotypes (NH); Number (and percentage) of haplotypes shared with other populations from the West region (SH); Gene diversity (h); Nucleotide diversity (n) and Mean number of pairwise differences (k) \u00b1 standard deviation (sd).\nPopulation\tN\tNH\tSH (%)\th\u00b1sd\tn\u00b1sd\tk\u00b1sd\nLis\t20\t5\t2 (40%)\t0.679\u00b10.080\t0.0012\u00b10.0010\t0.832\u00b10.619\nS\u00e3o Pedro\t20\t3\t3 (100%)\t0.468\u00b10.104\t0.0014\u00b10.0011\t0.995\u00b10.700\nAlcoa\t20\t3\t1 (33%)\t0.195\u00b10.114\t0.0003\u00b10.0004\t0.200\u00b10.259\nTornada\t13\t4\t1 (25%)\t0.423\u00b10.164\t0.0006\u00b10.0007\t0.461\u00b10.432\nReal\t20\t7\t2 (29%)\t0.521\u00b10.135\t0.0013\u00b10.0011\t0.968\u00b10.687\nMondego\t112\t14\t2 (14%)\t0.781\u00b10.056\t0.0037\u00b10.0023\t2.676\u00b11.484\nTejo\t21\t5\t4 (80%)\t0.385\u00b10.068\t0.0036\u00b10.0021\t1.556\u00b10.937\nThe network of A. oligolepis haplotypes (N=33) showed a reticulated pattern centred in the ancestral haplotype, AOL14, which was shared by most individuals from Mondego, Tejo and S\u00e3o Pedro (Figure 5-3) basins. The most frequent haplotypes were AOL14 and AOL1, which were shared by individuals\nfrom Alcoa, Real and Tornada basins, and represented 22% (N=49) and 19% (N=42) of the individuals sampled, respectively (Figure 5-3). From the ancestral haplotype (AOL14), 16 other haplotypes diverged by one to three mutational steps, most of them within the Mondego basin , with 12 private haplotypes and one shared with the Tejo population, and the remaining three within the Tejo population (AOL31-33; Figure 5-3). Besides this more ancestral clade, the haplotype network showed two other clades: 1) a star-like group centred in the second most common haplotype (AOL1), found in the Western populations of Tornada, Alcoa and Real basins, from which 10 haplotypes, nine of them private to a single Western population, diverged by one to three mutations; and 2) a terminal clade derived from the previously described one, which included five haplotypes, three private to the Lis population and the remaining two shared between Lis, S\u00e3o Pedro and Tejo populations. Thus, globally, these results showed that more ancestral haplotypes were found in some individuals outside of the Mondego basin, namely in the Tejo and S\u00e3o Pedro populations), and that a considerable diversification occurred in the West region, particularly in the Lis and S\u00e3o Pedro populations. Although showing some private haplotypes, the Tejo population harboured haplotypes shared with the Mondego and the Western populations of the Lis, S\u00e3o Pedro and Real basins.\nFigure 5-3: Haplotype network of A. oligolepis populations from the West region and the Neighbour rivers basins of\nMondego and Tejo. *ancestral haplotype (outgroup weight=0.175)\nAMOVA results for the Western populations showed that 65.85% of the variation occurred among populations (Va=0.684; p<0.001) and 34.15% within populations (Vb=0.355; p<0.001). The overall fixation index was high and significant (FST=0.658, p-value<0.001), indicating that populations of A. oligolepis from the West region were highly structured.\nWhen assuming the Western, Tejo and Sado populations as distinct, AMOVA showed that 55.87% of the variation was explained among groups (FCT=0.559; p=0.048\u00b10.002), 22.21% among populations within groups (FSC=0.503; p<0.001\u00b10.000) and 21.92% within groups (FST=0.781; p<0.001\u00b10.000), indicating that these populations were highly structured. This structuring was corroborated by the significant, corrected pairwise differences between most population pairs, with the exception of\npopulations from Alcoa, Real and Tornada basins (p>0.050). The percentage of divergence between Western populations was extremely low, ranging from 0% to 0.30%, which corresponds to recent estimated times of divergence (<3300 years ago; Table 5-7).\nConcerning the divergence from the Neighbour populations, the Western and Tejo populations were closely related. Indeed, the divergence from the Tejo population occurred between 5493 and 6744 years ago (0.60%-0.70% of divergence) whereas the estimated time of divergence from the population in the Mondego basin was at 6868 to 8209 years ago (0.70-90% of divergence; Table 5-7).\nTable 5-7: Relationships between A. oligolepis populations from the West region and the Neighbour river basins of Mondego and Tejo based on the average corrected pairwise distances between haplotypes.

The effective population sizes and time since the expansion estimated for Alcoa were lower than those of Tornada (0; 9767 years and 930; 36916 years respectively; Table 9-21 section 9). On the contrary, the migration rate was lower in the Tornada population (Table 9-21 section 9).\nThe mismatch distributions were narrow and unimodal for Lis, Alcoa, Tornada and Real populations and bimodal and wider only for the S\u00e3o Pedro population (Figure 9-2 section 9).\nHigh gene flow was detected between the two Neighbour populations of the Tejo-Mondego basins (M>1; Table 9-17 section 9).\n5.3.1 Achondrostoma oligolepis Nuclear DNA data\nThe network of A. oligolepis beta-actin haplotypes showed some diversification within the populations at the nuclear level, particularly within the Western populations, showing some divergence from the Neighbour populations. Indeed, from the seven private haplotypes found three are private to Western populations (two in Lis and one in Tornada) and from the remaining five haplotypes, four are shared\nbetween Western populations and a single haplotype (AOL_B1) is shared by Neighbour and a Western population (Tornada; Figure 5-4). The topology of this network showed a star-like pattern centred in the ancestral haplotype AOL_B2, shared by individuals of the Alcoa, Lis, Tornada and Real populations. The most frequent haplotypes were the ancestral haplotype, which represented 44% (N=31) of the sampled individuals, and the haplotype AOL_B1, shared by individuals from Tornada, Mondego and Tejo basins, which represented 57% (N=40) of the individuals sampled. The three private haplotypes were found in the Western populations: AOL_B6 and AOL_B12 in Lis (derived from the ancestral haplotype AOL_B2 by, respectively, three and one mutational steps) and AOL_B7 in Tornada (also derived from the ancestral haplotype by 12 mutational steps).\nFigure 5-4: Haplotype network of A. oligolepis populations from the West region and Neighbour rivers basins of Mondego and Tejo. *ancestral haplotype (outgroup weight=0.239)\n5.4\tSqualius pyrenaicus\nThe mitochondrial cytb dataset obtained for Squalius pyrenaicus populations from the West region comprised 15 distinct haplotypes and shows moderate levels of genetic diversity: h=0.676\u00b10.039, n=0.0016\u00b10.0011 and k=1.134\u00b10.742. The molecular diversity indices obtained for each Western and Neighbour (Tejo and Sado) population are presented in Table 5-8. Between the Western populations, the highest number of haplotypes and also the highest values for all the molecular diversity indices were found in the Lizandro population (Table 5-8), while the lowest values were shown by the Samarra, Lage and Jamor populations (Table 5-8).\nAll haplotypes found in the Lage and Jamor populations were shared with other Western populations (Table 5-8). Contrastingly, the haplotypes found in the Samarra population were private (Table 5-8).\nBoth the genetic diversity indices and the number of haplotypes were generally lower in the Western than Neighbour populations (Table 5-8).\nIt is worth mentioning that it was expected that the Squalius individuals sampled in the Lis River were\nS.\tcarolitertii, similar to what occurs in the geographically close Mondego and Alcoa basins. However, the obtained mtDNA sequences were from S. pyrenaicus, and this was further confirmed with the sequencing of the nuclear beta-actin gene (see section 5.7).\nTable 5-8: Molecular diversity indices for S. pyrenaicus populations from the West region and the Neighbour river basins of Tejo and Sado.

Regarding the later clade, the network was highly branched and showed a reticulate pattern, centred in the ancestral and most common haplotype (SP1), which was shared by the Colares, Jamor, Lizandro, Lage, Sado and Tejo populations. From the ancestral haplotype, 54 haplotypes diverge: three shared and 51 private From the 15 haplotypes found in Western populations, only four were shared with the Neighbour populations (SP1, SP6, SP7 and SP9) while ten were private to a given population and one (SP5) was shared by individuals from Lizandro and Jamor populations.\nFigure 5-5: Haplotype network of S. pyrenaicus population from the West region and from the Neighbour rivers basins of Tejo and Sado (outgroup weight=0.160). *ancestral haplotype\nAMOVA results showed that the variation among and within S. pyrenaicus populations from the West region was similar (50.55% and 49.45%, respectively; Va=0.312 and Vb=0.305; p<0.001). The significance of the overall fixation index (FST=0.505, p-value<0.001) reflected the genetic structuring of the Western populations.\nWhen assuming the West, Tejo and Sado as distinct populations, AMOVA results showed that 71.00% of the variation was explained among groups (FCT=0.710; p=0.248\u00b10.004), 4.97% among populations within groups (FSC=0.171; p<0.001\u00b10.000) and 24.03 within groups (FST=0.760 p<0.001\u00b10.000), indicating that the populations were highly structured.\nAverage corrected pairwise differences were not significant between Lage, Jamor and Lizandro, and between Colares, Lage and Jamor populations (p>0.050), and the very low percentages of divergence indicate recent divergence times between these populations (Table 5-9). For the remaining population pairs, the differences were significant (p<0.050). Among pairs of Western populations, the percentage of divergence varied between 0.01% and 0.25%, corresponding to estimate times of divergence of 121 to 2388 years, respectively. The Western populations diverged more recently from the Tejo population, as expected due to its geographical proximity. The Sado population displayed a percentage of 1.902.20% of divergence from the Western populations, while the Tejo population only diverged 0.02% from Lizandro, Colares, Lage and Jamor populations and 0.10% from Lis and Samarra populations.\nTable 5-9: Relationships between S. pyrenaicus populations from the West region and the Neighbour populations (Tejo and Sado) based on the average corrected pairwise distances between haplotypes.

Despite most of the haplotypes differed from the ancestor (SC1) by one mutational step, the presence of a branch of seven haplotypes private to the Mondego population which diverged from the ancestor by one (SC5) to nine mutations (SC4 and SC11) reflected a clear diversification process occurring within the Mondego basin.\nFigure 5-6: Haplotype network of S. carolitertii populations from the West region and from the Neighbour Mondego river basin. *ancestral haplotype (outgroup weight=0.246).\nAMOVA results showed that most of the variation (93.56%) was explained by variation within populations (Vb=0.743; p=0.016\u00b10.001) and only 6.44% was explained by variation among populations (Va=0.051; p=0.016\u00b10.001). The significant but low overall fixation index (FST=0.064, p=0.016\u00b10.001) indicated, as expected, a low degree of genetic structuring between both populations. However, due to the high intra variability of the Mondego population, a significant corrected pairwise difference was detected between the two populations (Table 5-11).\nThe estimated low percentage of divergence between populations suggested an extremely recent separation event (Table 5-11), which was corroborated by a high gene flow (M=7.268).\nTable 5-11: Relationships between S. carolitertiii populations from the West region and from the Neighbour populations of Mondego based on the average corrected pairwise distances between haplotypes.

Indeed, most of the sampled haplotypes (N=13; 62%) were private to a single population, either from the West region (S3 in Jamor) or from the Neighbour river basins (S8, S10, S11 and S12 in Sado, S14, S15, S17 and S18 in Tejo and S19, S20 and S21 in Mondego) (Figure 5-7). The remaining seven haplotypes were shared by two to nine populations without an evident geographically-related pattern (Figure 5-7).\nA single haplotype (S5) was found in Alcoa population, corresponding to the southern distribution limit of S. carolitertii, and was shared by individuals from Mondego, Lis and Tejo populations. In the Lis population, corresponding to the northern distribution limit of S. pyrenaicus, three haplotypes were found (S2, S4 and S5), all of which were shared by individuals from others populations (Figure 5-7).\nFigure 5-7: Haplotype network of Squalius populations from the West region and Neighbour rivers basins of Mondego, Tejo and Sado. *ancestral haplotype (outgroup weight=0.178)\n5.7\tPseudochondrostoma polylepis\nThe mitochondrial dataset for Pseudochondrostoma polylepis from the West region comprised five distinct haplotypes and moderate overall levels of genetic diversity: h=0.516\u00b10.070, n=0.0010\u00b10.0008 and k=0.710\u00b10.542. The molecular diversity indices obtained for Western and Neighbour populations are presented in Table 5-12. Concerning the Western populations, Lis and Colares showed a higher number of haplotypes and higher values for all the molecular indices than those of Alcoa, (in which a single haplotype was found,) and of the Neighbour populations of Mondego and Sado (Table 5-12). The Lis population was the only Western population showing private haplotypes, while in the Alcoa and Colares 100% of the haplotypes were shared (Table 5-12). Overall, the highest values of genetic diversity and the highest number of total and private haplotypes were found in the Neighbour population of Tejo (Table 5-12).\nTable 5-12: Molecular diversity indices obtained for P. polylepis populations from the West region and the Neighbour rivers basins of Mondego, Tejo and Sado.

Besides these two frequent haplotypes, only haplotype PP3 was shared by individuals from Western and Neighbour populations (Colares and Tejo) and haplotype PP8 was shared between the two Neighbour populations (Tejo and Sado; Figure 5-8). The remaining 25 haplotypes were private of a specific population: 20 haplotypes were private to Tejo, 1 to Lis, 2 to Mondego and 2 to Sado populations.\nFigure 5-8: Haplotype network of P. polylepis populations from the West region and from the Neighbour rivers basins of\nMondego, Tejo and Sado. *ancestral haplotype (outgroup weight=0.274)\nAMOVA results concerning the Western populations showed that 59.89% of the variation can be explained among populations (Va=0.684; p<0.001) and 40.11% within populations (Vb=0.355; p<0.001). The significance of the overall fixation index (FST=0.599, p-value<0.001) reflected the genetic structuring of the Western populations.\nWhen considering the Western, Mondego, Tejo and Sado as distinct populations, AMOVA results show that 21.56% of the variation is explained among groups (FCT=0.216; p=0.452\u00b10.004), 29.81% among populations within groups (FSC=0.380; p<0.001\u00b10.000) and 48.63% within groups (FST=0.514; p<0.001\u00b10.000), indicating that the populations are not highly structured.\npercentages of divergence showed that separation events were extremely recent and that Lis and Alcoa were more closely related to Mondego (0.00% of divergence), while Colares was closer to Tejo (0.01%). As expected, higher divergence times were estimated between the Western and Sado population, the most geographically distant Neighbour population (0.30% to 0.40%, corresponding to estimated times of divergence between 2416 and 3975 years).\nTable 5-13: Relationships between P. polylepis populations from the West region and the Neighbour populations of Mondego, Tejo and Sado based on the average corrected pairwise distances between haplotypes.

The highest gene flow was estimated to have occurred between Alcoa and Mondego populations (Table 9-19 section 9).\n5.8\tLuciobarbus bocagei\nThe mitochondrial cytb dataset for Luciobarbus bocagei from the West region comprised only two haplotypes and moderate overall levels of genetic diversity: h=0.468\u00b10.031, n=0.0007\u00b10.000636 and k=0.468\u00b10.413. The molecular diversity indices obtained for each population are presented in Table 514. Due to the low number of haplotypes, the values of genetic diversity are lower for Western than the Neighbour populations (except for the h index, which is higher in Lis than in the Mondego) (Table 514). No private haplotypes were detected in the Western populations (100% of shared haplotypes), contrasting with the 22% to 67% of shared haplotypes obtained for the Neighbour populations (Table 5-14).\nTable 5-14: Molecular diversity indices for L. bocagei populations from the West region and the Neighbour rivers basins of Mondego, Tejo and Sado.

Both haplotypes found in the populations of the West region were shared with the Neighbour populations: LBlwas shared with individuals from Tejo and Mondego populations and LB2 with individuals from Tejo, Mondego and Sado populations. These haplotypes were also the most common, representing 67% (LB2; N=369) and 17% (LB1; N=94) of the individuals sampled, (Figure 5-9). The remaining haplotypes were private to Tejo (LB5 and LB11) and to Sado (LB3 and LB4), pointing to diversification processes occurring within these river basins (Figure 5-9).\nFigure 5-9: Haplotype network of L. bocagei populations from the West region and the Neighbour river basins of Mondego, Tejo and Sado. *ancestral haplotype (outgroup weight=0.292)\nAMOVA results concerning the Western populations showed that variation was higher among (77.35%; Va=0.222, p<0.001) than within populations (22.65%; Vb=0.065, p<0.001). The overall fixation index\nwas high and significant (Fst=0.773, p<0.001), indicating that although they share the same two haplotypes, Western populations are structured.\nWhen considering the West, Mondego, Tejo and Sado populations as disctint, AMOVA results showed that only 17.99% of the variation is explained among populations (Va=0.071) and most of the variation (82.01%) was explained within populations (Vb=0.326). The overall fixation index was low but significant (Fst=0.180, p<0.001), pointing to the existence of genetic structuring.\nCorrected pairwise differences were significant (p<0.050) between all pairs of populations except Lizandro-Colares, Mondego-Lis, Tejo-Lizandro, Sado-Colares and Sado-Lizandro (Table 5-15). The divergence values between Western populations were very low (between 0.00% and 0.14%), corresponding to extremely recent divergence times between populations (under 1500 years; Table 515). As expected, geographically close populations were the ones that diverged more recently: Alcoa and Lis in the northernmost part of the West region, and Lizandro and Colares in the southernmost part. The divergence between the Western populations and those of the Neighbour river basins was also very recent: Lis and Alcoa diverged from the Mondego less than 352 years ago, and Colares and Lizandro populations were virtually identical to those from the Tejo and Sado basins.\nTable 5-15: Relationships between L. bocagei populations from the West region and from Neighbour river basins of Mondego, Tejo and Sado based on the average corrected pairwise distances between haplotypes.

For the remaining Western populations, mismatch analyses were not conducted due to the presence of a single haplotype.\nHigh gene flow (M>1) was detected for all Western and Neighbour population pairs, except between Alcoa and the three Neighbour Mondego, Tejo and Sado basins and between Lis and Mondego basins (Table 9-20 section 9). The highest gene flow was estimated to have occurred for Tejo-Colares and Tejo-Lizandro pairs (Table 9-20 section 9).\n6.\tDISCUSSION\nGiven the high anthropogenic pressure which affects river basins (e.g. Allan and Flecker, 1993; Malmqvist and Rundle, 2002), the minimization of the extinction risk for freshwater fishes (one of the most threatened taxonomic groups at a global scale; Nelson et al., 2016) requires a set of multidisciplinary data regarding the threatened populations. Thus, genetic and biogeographic data are important, as well as ecological data, to define evolutionary significant units, establish conservation priorities and propose well-founded conservation management practices.\nIn this context, it was known that the small river basins of the West region of Portugal harbour seven Iberian and Portuguese endemic cyprinids (Iberochondrostoma lusitanicum, Achondrostoma occidentale, Achondrostoma oligolepis, Squalius pyrenaicus, Squalius carolitertii, Pseudochondrostoma polylepis and Luciobarbus bocagei), most of which with a high conservation status and medium to low levels of genetic diversity (Cabral et al. 2005, Sousa-Santos et al. 2016). However, a complete analysis of all the populations from the West region regarding genetic diversity was still lacking, and there was no evidence allowing the reconstitution of the colonization routes used by the species and the assessment of the eventual barrier effect imposed by the mountain ranges isolating the Western river basins from the larger Neighbour river basins.\nThus, in order to provide genetic and biogeographic data for a more efficient conservation and management of the native cyprinid fish species from the West region of Portugal, their evolutionary history was drawn with the determination of the colonization source of each population, the divergence times between populations and their current levels of genetic diversity.\nFinally, the importance of genetic and biogeographic analyses for conservation management plans is discussed according to the observed patterns, units of conservation and evolutionary significant units (ESUs) are suggested and future concerns for freshwater fish conservation are highlighted.\n6.1\tEvolutionary history of cyprinid populations from the West region of Portugal\nAs mentioned in the first section of this thesis, Cyprinid fish colonized the Iberian Peninsula during the Oligocene (Doadrio etal., 2011) and dispersed through connections between endorheic Miocene lakes that only began to be exorheic in the Neogene (Andeweg, 2002). These endorheic basins were the precursors of current large river basins, such as those of the Douro, Ebro, Guadiana and Tejo, and acted as sources of colonizers when the Iberian river network started its establishment (Almada and Sousa-Santos, 2010). Then, as the hydrographical network developed, ancient fish were allowed to disperse throughout the Iberian territory and eventually reached the Western border of the Portuguese territory. According to the findings presented in this work, the colonization of the West region by cyprinids was posterior to the formation of the surrounding Montejunto, Sico-Aire-Candeeiros and Sintra mountain systems of Jurassic age (Kullberg et al., 2013).\nGlobally, the obtained results suggest that cyprinids colonized the West region during the Holocene, more recently than the Pleistocenic age previously proposed by Sousa-Santos et al. (2007) and Waap et al. (2011) for the Western populations of S. pyrenaicus. The estimated divergence times between the Western and Neighbour populations of A. oligolepis and I. lusitanicum indicate that the colonization of the West region ceased 7000 to 2500 years ago, coinciding with a marine regression and the reaching of the current sea level (Cunha and Gouveia, 2015). The estimated divergence times between the Western and Neighbour populations obtained for S. pyrenaicus, S. carolitertii, L. bocagei and P. polylepis are\nlesser than 1500 years, reinforcing the view that the Western basins were colonized very recently, posteriorly to all the major geomorphological rearrangements that occurred in the region. Moreover, within the West region, the estimated divergence times between populations was null to low (less than 2500 years ago) for all the species.\nDue to their intolerance to marine salinity, which prevented the migration between river mouths by the sea, the colonization and dispersion of cyprinids in the West region could only have occurred through connections between coastal paleobasins, fluvial headwater captures, confluence of river mouths during marine regressions and/or subterranean streams linking river basins. Dendritic subterranean drainages are common in karstic mountains such as Sico-Aire-Candeeiros (Cunha, 1990) and underground dispersal of fish between river basins of both sides of a mountain range has been suggested in other regions of the globe (Kim et al., 2016). Although cavernous cyprinids have only been found in South Spain (Doadrio et al., 2016), the colonization of Western rivers by fish from the river basins located on the opposite slope of karstic mountains but linked though subterranean streams is plausible, especially during transgressions and intense pluvial periods. This hypothesis might explain the colonization of the rivers from the upper West region by fish from Mondego and Tejo basins, through subterranean streams present in the karstic Sico-Aire-Candeeiros mountains, as will be detailed below.\nThe genetic validation of the taxonomy of the cyprinids present in the West region retrieved three distinct association of species: 1) I. lusitanicum, S. pyrenaicus, P. polylepis and L. bocagei in the southern part of the West region, including in Jamor, Ossos, Lage, Colares, Samarra and Lizandro river basins, 2) A. occidentale, in the intermediate part, including Safarujo, Sizandro and Alcabrichel river basins, and 3) A. oligolepis, S. carolitertii, S. pyrenaicus, P. polylepis and L. bocagei in the northern part of the West region, including Real, Tornada, Alcoa, S\u00e3o Pedro and Lis river basins.\nFigure 6-1: Diagram illustrating the West region colonization routes: 1) from the Mondego southwards by A. oligolepis (AOL), S. carolitertii (SC), P. polylepis (PP) and L. bocagei (LB); and 2) from the Tejo westwards by I. lusitanicum (IL), S. pyrenaicus (SP), P. polylepis (PP) and L. bocagei (LB).'\nDue to their geographical positioning, the river basins of Mondego, Tejo and Sado were the three possible sources of colonizers for the Western basins. According to the higher divergence times found between Sado and the Western populations, Sado was not a direct source of colonizers. Contrastingly,\nlow divergence times were found between the populations from the northern part of the West region and Mondego, and between the populations from the southern part of the West region and Tejo. Thus, two independent routes are proposed to explain the colonization of the West region: 1) S. carolitertii, A. oligolepis, L. bocagei and P. polylepis followed a southward route from Mondego to the West region; and 2) S. pyrenaicus, I. lusitanicum, L. bocagei and P. polylepis followed a West-Northwestward route from Tejo to the West region (Figure 6-1). According to this scenario, L. bocagei and P. polylepis colonized both ends of the West region by distinct routes, one from the Mondego southwards and the other from the Tejo Westwards.\nHowever, three exceptional occurrences are apparently inconsistent with the proposed colonization pattern: a) A. oligolepis population from the Nab\u00e3o, the only Tejo sub-basin where this species occurs; b) S. pyrenaicus enclave in River Lis, flanked by S. carolitertii populations from the Mondego and Alcoa; and c) the three populations of A. occidentale, isolated in the intermediate part of the West region, where no other cyprinid species occur.\nRegarding the A. oligolepis population from Nab\u00e3o, a tributary of the right bank of the Tejo which is geographically close to a left bank sub-basin of the Mondego (River Arunca), its presence might be explained by one of the following hypothesis: 1) fish from the Mondego colonized the Nab\u00e3o through an headwater capture in the Sic\u00f3 mountain (currently Arunca and Nab\u00e3o headwaters are only approximately 25 km apart); 2) flooded karstic subterranean drainages of the Sic\u00f3 mountain allowed the passage of fish from the Mondego to the Nab\u00e3o, and 3) anthropogenic introduction. Among these hypotheses, the first two appear more plausible than the last one, since the Tejo population shows private haplotypes derived from haplotypes present in the Mondego population (Figure 6-3). Although the third hypothesis may not be completely discarded, if the A. oligolepis population from Nab\u00e3o was introduced its haplotypes would be shared with the population from where the introduced stock came from and, most likely, no private haplotypes of the cytb gene would be found. Future studies conducted with fast paced markers, such as microsatellites, may help to disentangle this issue.\nSecondly, considering the distribution ranges of S. carolitertii and S. pyrenaicus (Figure 3-2), it was not expected that S. carolitertii occurred in the Alcoa river basin and not in the Lis river basin, which is located immediately next to the Mondego (the previously assumed southernmost distribution limit of the species). The exceptional occurrence of a S. pyrenaicus population in the River Lis, flanked by two S. carolitertii populations (Mondego and Alcoa) might involve human-mediated introductions. Three alternative scenarios may be drawn to explain the S. pyrenaicus enclave in the River Lis: 1) S. carolitertii naturally dispersed from the Mondego southwards, reaching Lis and Alcoa rivers, but was latter displaced by S. pyrenaicus introduced in the Lis; 2) S. pyrenaicus from the Tejo colonized the River Lis through river capture (the headwaters of Lis are geographically close to those of the Alviela and Nab\u00e3o tributaries) and S. carolitertii was introduced in the River Alcoa; and 3) S. carolitertii dispersed naturally from Mondego to Lis and to Alcoa when these two latter rivers were still connected and, more recently, a headwater capture between Lis and Tejo allowed the colonization by S. pyrenaicus, displacing (or largely supplanting in density) the former S. carolitertii population from the Lis. As the results obtained for the mitochondrial and nuclear genes were inconclusive, these hypotheses should be addressed in future studies to be conducted in the Alcoa and Lis populations, using larger samples, collected in multiple sites across the river basins, and genotyping polymorphic microsatellites.\noligolepis along the Portuguese Atlantic border might have been related to the vicariant event which isolated A. occidentale in the intermediate part of the West region more than 7 Mya (Robalo et al., 2006a), long before the estimated colonization of the region by the remaining cyprinid species. Thus, it seems that A. occidentale was the first species colonizing the West region or at least the most ancient species persisting in the region until the present. Also, since no other cyprinid occurs in sympatry with A. occidentale, it seems plausible that the above mentioned routes advanced to explain the colonization of the West region were not extendable to the Alcabrichel, Sizandro and Safarujo river basins. The route from Mondego southwards likely ended in the Real river basin (the southernmost distribution limit of A. oligolepis) and the route from the Tejo West-Northwestwards reached Lizandro river basin (the northernmost distribution limit of I. lusitanicum). Considering the geographical location of the river basins where it occurs, the isolation of A. occidentale in the intermediate part of the West region may be related to a barrier effect imposed by the Montejunto mountain range, preventing contacts with Tejo tributaries, and by the absence of recent connections between Neighbour river basins. Furthermore, the submarine canyons such as the Nazar\u00e9 canyon could have acted as isolation barriers during regressions, preventing colonization by confluence of river mouths, as mention in section 1.2.\nAssuming that the colonization routes were the same and were available at the same time for all the species, it was expected that the divergence times were similar between the Western populations and the Mondego and Tejo populations which acted as colonization sources for all the species. However, different patterns of differentiation between Western and Neighbour populations were found among species (Table 6-1). There was a moderated to low differentiation for A. oligolepis and I. lusitanicum and an extremely low differentiation for S. carolitertii, S. pyrenaicus, P. polylepis and L. bocagei. Thus, higher differentiation from the colonization source was detected for the species with smaller size, lower generation time and little or no migratory ability (Table 6-1; Ribeiro et al., 2007). Although the difference is not substantial, these results point to the eventual existence of intrinsic drivers of genetic variation related to the life-history traits of the species, as already suggested by Sousa-Santos et al. (2016). Further studies are needed to clarify this issue.\nTable 6-1: Summary results for each species (e.g. Doadrio et al., 2011; Ribeiro et al., 2007; Rodrigues, 1999)\nSpecies\tMax. size (cm)\tGeneration time (years)\tColonization source\tDifferentiation between Western and Neighbour populations\tIntrapopulation diversity Average \u00b1 sd (Nb. populations)\t% Variation among populations (AMOVA)\nI. lusitanicum\t15\t2\tTejo\t0.30%\t0 (N=6)\t-\nA. oligolepis\t15\t2\tMondego\t0.80%\u00b10.07\t0.69\u00b10.35 (N=5)\t74.96%\nA occidentale\t15\t2\t-\t-\t0.57\u00b10.75 (N=3)\t65.85%\nS. pyrenaicus\t26\t3.5\tTejo\t0.05%\u00b10.04\t0.61\u00b10.53 (N=6)\t50.55%\nS. carolitertii\t26\t3.5\tMondego\t0.02%\t0.10 (N=1)\t-\nP. polylepis -northern part\t40\t3.5\tMondego\t0%\t0.20\u00b10.29 (N=2)\t59.89%\nP. polylepis -southern part\t40\t3.5\tTejo\t0.01%\t0.73 (N=1)\t59.89%\nL. bocagei -northern part\t100\t6\tMondego\t0.02%\u00b10.03\t0.26\u00b10.37 (N=2)\t77.35%\nL. bocagei -southern part\t100\t6\tTejo\t0%\t0 (N=2)\t77.35%\n6.2\tGenetic Diversity of cyprinid populations from the West region of Portugal\nFreshwater fish populations are facing a decrease in genetic diversity at the global scale, due to multiple, often cumulative, threats, such as habitat degradation and fragmentation, pollution, biological invasions, damming, water abstraction and flow regulation (e.g. Allan and Flecker 1993; Malmqvist and Rundle,\n2002; Macedo-Veiga et al., 2013). The populations of cyprinids native to Portugal are not an exception (e.g. Collares-Pereira et al., 2000; Ribeiro et al., 2007; Sousa-Santos et al., 2016).\nCyprinids from the West region of Portugal display low intra-population variability and moderate to low levels of molecular diversity, which are slightly lower than those found in the contiguous larger river basins of Mondego, Tejo and Sado. Moreover, the overall genetic diversity values obtained for the species occurring in the West region are slightly lower than those obtained for the same species at all national range scale (Sousa-Santos et al., 2016).\nAlthough this low diversity may be associated with the recent colonization of the West region, it can also result, at least in part, from the occurrence of successive bottlenecks caused by marine transgressions after the last glaciation and, more recently, by events imposing severe reductions of the population effective size (e.g. discharges of pollutants and cyclical summer droughts; Macedo-Veiga et al., 2013). Distinct populations from different river basins may had been differently affected by extrinsic drivers due to the different geomorphological characteristics of each river basins. This view is corroborated by the fact that, although the colonization of distinct Western river basins occurred within the same time frame, distinct levels of intra-population variability were detected for each species (Figures 5-2, 5-4, 5-6, 5-8, 5-10, 5-12 and 5-14).\nThus, the results indicate that the genetic variation may be constrained by environmental conditions, which may explain the distinct levels of genetic variation for each population of a given species, and also by species-specific traits, as mention in the previous section, which may explain differences between species occurring in the samebasins. An example of these differences is the fact that while populations of I. lusitanicum and L. bocagei from the southern part of the West region are identical (null intra-population variability), the sympatric P. polylepis and S'. pyrenaicus showed moderate levels of intra-population variability (Table 6-1).\nGlobally, it thus appears that genetic diversity may be conditioned by multiple intrinsic and extrinsic drivers such as tolerance to environmental variations, habitat preferences, reproductive strategies, and the environmental variations sourced in geological, climatic and anthropological events that affect habitat availability, quality, and connectivity (Osborne et al., 2014; Sousa-Santos et al., 2016). Moreover, it can also be highlighted that, besides being recently separated, most of the Western populations are clearly differentiated from each other and from the Neighbour populations from which they were founded.\n6.3\tManagement and conservation of cyprinid populations from the West region of Portugal\nTaken together, the results obtained in this thesis have important implications for the conservation management of native cyprinids from the West region of Portugal. Although resulting from recent colonization events from the contiguous Tejo and Mondego river basins, the Western populations of each species are clearly differentiated. The observed patterns suggest the presence of accumulated differences within each population, reflecting their unique evolutionary histories after the cessation of past connections between distinct rivers and the consequent isolation of populations, but also the adaptation to different environmental conditions, as suggested by Frankham et al. (2010). Thus, for conservation and management purposes, the Western populations should be considered distinct conservation units and, thus, managed separately, with specific concerns and conservation measures. Indeed, the results obtained in this thesis reinforce the view that the conservation of primary freshwater fish should be considered an exceptional case within the conservation of fish sensu lato, similarly to what happens with the conservation of island species, due to their isolation and consequent particular\nevolution. As such, all populations must also be viewed as ESUs since their evolutionary history is unique. However, if it is not possible to establish conservation plans encompassing all populations and some prioritization is necessary, the first targets for conservation should be the populations of A. occidentale, due to their high differentiation from the most common and geographically close Achondrostoma species (A. oligolepis), limited range and ancient vicariant origin. The populations of I. lusitanicum and S. pyrenaicus should be placed in a second line of priority due to their high conservation status and for being the only populations of these species occurring outside large sized river basins, thus, representing the edges of their respective radiations. Thirdly, and although the conservation status of the species is not high (Vulnerable), Western populations of A. oligolepis should also be prioritized due to their high divergence from the colonization source.\nContrasting the results obtained for the different species, intrinsic ecological and biological traits seem to be influencing their genetic variation. More specifically, it seems plausible to assume that the species which attain its first maturation at older ages (such as L. bocagei and P. polylepis) have less chances to accumulate mutations than more precocious species (such as I. lusitanicum, A. oligolepis and A. occidentale) which will have more generations within the same time frame and, thus, more chances to accumulate novel mutations. Similarly, populations of the larger species with higher migratory ability (such as the potamodromous L. bocagei and P. polylepis; Ribeiro et al., 2007) are expected to show more genetic homogenization due to higher gene flow than smaller sedentary species (such as I. lusitanicum, A. oligolepis and A. occidentale) which, due to their different ecology, are more prone to restricted gene flow between demes. This hypothesis was already suggested to explain the high genetic diversity of the small, sedentary, and fragmented populations of Anaecypris hispanica (Sousa-Santos et al., 2014b). Thus, conservation management plans should take into account this variability and the measures to implement should be species-specific. For instance, for species with higher migratory ability, it is crucial to consider management measures that prevent habitat fragmentation and that restore fluvial connectivity, such as eliminating transversal barriers and limiting water abstraction during the summer. On the other hand, for smaller species, such as I. lusitanicum, A. oligolepis and A. occidentale, the management measures should be focused on habitat rehabilitation, namely concerning the preservation of aquatic vegetation and the restoration of the riparian gallery, and on increasing the amount of refuges available during the summer (Mameri, 2015).\nFinally, it was clear that native cyprinids from the West region show low levels of genetic diversity, which theoretically will decrease the species ability to overcome environmental changes and, consequently, increase their risk of extinction (Frankham et al., 2010). These low levels of genetic diversity may be related to the loss of adequate spawning grounds, habitat fragmentation and poor conditions for the persistence of populations. These environmental negative impacts would lead to the reduction of the effective population size and, ultimately, to the loss of genetic diversity by inbreeding and lineage sorting (e.g. DeSalle and Amato, 2004; Allendorf et al., 2010; Frankham et al., 2010). Overall solutions include conservation efforts such as habitat restoration, creation of refuges, population reinforcements by ex-situ conservation programs, and re-introductions and translocations (Ginson, 2012). Despite the existence of international guidelines (McGowan etal., 2016), the re-introduction and translocation of species are often controversial (Maceda-Veiga, 2013), mainly because of the outbreeding depression risk (Week et al., 2011; Frankham et al., 2010) and the undesirable mixing of different conservation units (Moritz, 1994), as mention in the section 1.1. As it was evident from this study, in the particular case of native cyprinids, distinct populations have unique and unrepeatable evolutionary histories due to the permanent confinement to their river basins, thus, the translocation of individuals between populations to increase genetic diversity should be avoided at all cost. Alternatively, population reinforcements with captive bred fish (ongoing since 2011 in five Western river basins) are\na valuable conservation tool to increase the effective population size and minimize the risk of extinction, and should be conducted in parallel with in-situ conservation measures (Sousa-Santos et al. 2014b).\nAnother common conservation tool is the delineation of protected areas. Although small specific protection areas can act as sanctuaries for the endangered fish fauna and be a stepping stone for future recolonization of the remainder of the river basin, in order to take full effect of this measure, global protection of the river basin would be necessary since this ecosystem is a continuum (Dudgeon et al., 2006). In fact, if the environmental conditions in the remainder of the river basin are not improved, the populations might become reduced to the sanctuaries. Moreover, the pressures that threaten the remainder of the river basin might even lead to the degradation of the sanctuaries\u2019 conditions. Thus, global measures that aim to protect the entire river basin should be prioritized and can be considered as a better cost-efficiency option (Griffiths and Pavajeau 2008), increasing reproductive success and enabling the natural regeneration of the populations (Frankham et al., 2010). Furthermore, these measures could also prevent the aggravation of vulnerable species status, avoiding the loss of genetic diversity and the consequent loss of adaptation ability to environmental variations (Griffiths and Pavajeau, 2008).\nLikewise, introduction of global conservation measures in the river basins of the West region, would likely result in substantial improvements of the local fish communities. As such, future management projects targeting the native fish fauna in the West region should also focus on preventing the discharge of pollutants, limiting water abstraction, eradicating invasive fauna and flora such as Arundo donax and Procambarus clarkii and restoring the native riparian gallery.\n7.\tFINAL REMARKS\nIn conclusion, this study underlines the importance of conservation genetics to the preservation of endemic cyprinid species native to Portugal. Furthermore, it highlights the urgent need for multidisciplinary studies, encompassing among others genetic and phylogenetic data, and resulting in more well-reasoned decisions. Fine scale studies, such as this one, are essential to provide detailed information about freshwater fish populations and complement broad scale genetic studies (Wu et al., 2016).\nIn summary, Western populations of native cyprinids display low differentiation from the Neighbour river basins of Mondego and Tejo, reflecting recent colonization events (dated from the Holocene), most likely through headwater fluvial captures, connection between coastal paleobasins and/or confluence of river mouths during marine regressions. Despite the recent colonization and the low diversity found, populations of most of the native cyprinid species inhabiting the West region have already accumulated differences and show clear differentiation between them. The Western populations of native cyprinids should thus be considered as independent conservation units, due to their island-like idiosyncrasies, and, moreover, effective management and conservation measures should be species-specific.\nFuture studies should specifically address ecological, biological, and environmental drivers of genetic diversity for a better comprehension of the patterns highlighted in this study. Also, further knowledge on the availability and connectivity of suitable habitats for fish and the way this may vary under future climate scenarios would be critical for the development of effective conservation management plans for river basins in the Western region.\n8.\tREFERENCES\nAboim, M.A., Mesquita, N., Drago, M., Coelho, M.M., Alves, M.J., 2013.
