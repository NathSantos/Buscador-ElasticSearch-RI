The region has considerable gold exploration potential. There are many mines which have produced \n\nthousands of tons of gold. Mina Grande, Cuiab\u00e1 and Raposos are considered world class deposits. Other smaller deposits, \n\nincluding Faria, Bicalho, Engenho, D\u00b4\u00e1gua and Morro da Gl\u00f3ria, are found in the central-northern area of the Rio das Velhas \n\nSupergroup (Dorr 1969).  They have been known since the 18\nth\n\n century and are normally associated with a number of geological \n\nfactors and \u201ccoincidences\u201d which have occurred and have manifested in three dimensions. This thesis is organized in two distinct \n\ndevelopments. The first Chapter \u201cGeochemical and Geophysical Signatures of Induced Polarization, Resistivity and \n\nElectromagnetic Surveys of Orogenic Gold Deposits in the Quadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero \u2013 Case Studies in Lamego Deposit and \n\nSurrounding Targets, Minas Gerais, Brazil, presents data results of the geophysical inversion from data windows of the survey \n\n\u201cSpectrem - Airborne Electromagnetic Survey-2002\", along with resistivity and induced polarization (IP) ground surveys. The \n\nstudies provide a characterization of the signatures of known sulphide bodies from Lamego\u2019s deposit and estimates the depth of \n\npossible lateral extensions of the electromagnetic, resistive and/or geoelectric conductive bodies in this deposit. This work \n\ndescribes the results of geological, geophysical, and geochemical research conducted in the region between the Lamego and \n\nCuiab\u00e1 deposits, starting with the methodological characterization, geophysical and geochemical signatures established for the \n\nLamego deposit, aiming at a regional metallogenic analysis and assessment of the potential for locating similar gold deposits. The \n\nmain objectives of this work is (i) to characterize the behavior of IP signatures, resistivity and air EM of the  sulphide host rocks \n\nof the gold mineralization of the Lamego deposit, considering the three dimensional geological/geochemical modeling, aligned \n\nwith the direct inversion process of each of the geophysical properties; (ii) to locate possible lateral extensions and at depth of \n\npotential sulphide bodies containing gold mineralization; (iii) to investigate, in depth, the continuity of soil and excavation \n\nanomalies through the geophysical sections, which help in locating gold deposits in the north-northwest region of the \n\nQuadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero; (iv) to characterize the methodological criteria for mineral exploration by IP geophysics and three \n\ndimensional integration of multi-source information; to appropriately employ the scheduling, configuration, and geophysical \n\ninversion methodology used in the Lamego deposit in target satellites to aid the exploration scheduling of surface drilling; to \n\ntabulate the main characteristics of geophysical signatures of all surveyed targets and deposits in order to understand the \n\ncorrelation with the different models of researched materials. Additionally, a complementary study applied on Morro da Gl\u00f3ria \n\ndeposit was carry out based on the integration and three dimensional spatial analysis of multi-source data and the use of fuzzy \n\nlogic algorithms and geophysical inversion. The 3D integration of surface exploration data projected underground, together with \n\ngeological and geochemical information, combined with geophysical inversion methods applied to electromagnetic data, support \n\nthis study in the development of a model which has the potential to assist in finding and quantifying new three dimensional \n\nauriferous orebodies in Morro da Gl\u00f3ria gold deposit, which is located near Belo Horizonte city. The second Chapter \u201cOrdinary \n\nKriging and Conditional Simulation to Support Quantitative Estimation, Characterization and Classification of the \n\nLamego Gold Deposit \u2013 Quadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero \u2013 Brazil\u201d, presents geostatistical procedures which were used for quantitative \n\nestimation of grades and volumes of the orebodies and to support the final figures related to the metal content and classification of \n\nthe Lamego gold deposit. The ordinary kriging was used in the estimation and Sequential Gaussian Simulation (SGSIM) was used \n\nfor accessing the uncertainties and guiding the classification of the Deposit. The main procedures used in this work are \n\nsummarized as follow: (i) geological modeling of the mineralized orebodies; (ii) QA/AC characterization; (iii) exploration data \n\nanalysis; variogram fitting and analysis; (iv) nugget effect definition; (v) definition of the ordinary kriging parameters; (vi) \n\nordinary kriging validation and (vii) resource classification by SGSIM. Metallogenetical conclusions of Lamego deposit are \n\npresented based on geostatistical analysis and include the mean gold distribution of the horizontal volumetric panels indicates that \n\ngold grades are lower with increasing depth both in the Carruagem and Arco da Velha orebodies. Conversely, the mean gold \n\ndistribution of the vertical volumetric panels indicates that gold grades slightly increase following the north direction. This feature \n\ncan be associated with deformation episodes, which are coincident to the mineralizing hydrothermal fluid accumulation at those \n\nsites and/or associated to structural traps in the northern sectors of the aforementioned orebodies.  \n\n\n\nxii \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nxiii \n\nSUM\u00c1RIO \n\nResumo           ix \n\nAbstract           xi \n\nSum\u00e1rio           xiii \n\nLista de Figuras          xvii \n\nLista de Tabelas          xxiii \n\nIntrodu\u00e7\u00e3o          01 \n\nContexto da Pesquisa         03 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\nGEOCHEMICAL AND GEOPHYSICAL SIGNATURES OF INDUCED POLARIZATION, \n\nRESISTIVITY AND ELECTROMAGNETIC SURVEYS OF OROGENIC GOLD DEPOSITS IN \n\nTHE QUADRIL\u00c1TERO FERR\u00cdFERO \u2013 CASE STUDIES AT THE LAMEGO DEPOSIT AND \n\nSURROUNDING TARGETS, MINAS GERAIS, BRAZIL \n\n \n\nSummary 11 \n\n1 \u2013 Introduction 13 \n\n2 \u2013 Regional Geology   16 \n\nTectonic Evolution \n\nGlobal Metallogenetic Aspects \n\n19 \n\n19 \n\n3 \u2013 Geology of Lamego Gold Deposit 21 \n\n 3.1 \u2013 Structural geology 21 \n\n 3.2 \u2013 Description of Lithologies 24 \n\n 3.3 \u2013 Hydrothermalism 28 \n\n 3.4 \u2013 Mineralization 30 \n\n 3.5 \u2013 Orebodies 31 \n\n \n\n4 \u2013 Methodological Background 39 \n\n4.1 \u2013 Airborne Geophysics \u2013 SPECTREM 39 \n\n4.2 - Geophysical Inversion - History 41 \n\n4.3\u2013 Ground Geophysics Survey - Induced Polarization and Resistivity 45 \n\n\n\nxiv \n\n5 \u2013 Geophysical Results at Lamego Deposit and S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 Target  49 \n\n5.1 - Electromagnetic Results of the Lamego Deposit 49 \n\n5.2 - Geophysical Inversion of Electromagnetic Data  51 \n\n         5.3 - IP Survey of the Lamego Deposit and the S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 Target and Drilling 52 \n\n6 \u2013 Satellite Targets  60 \n\n8 \u2013 Biquinha Target 60 \n\n9 \u2013 Sobradinho Target 62 \n\n10 \u2013 Bom Caminho Target 70 \n\n7 \u2013 Geophysical Signatures of the Studied Areas 74 \n\n8 \u2013 Morro da Gl\u00f3ria Deposit 76 \n\n8.1 \u2013 Morro da Gl\u00f3ria Geological Settings 76 \n\n8.2 \u2013 Dataset 78 \n\n8.3 \u2013 Methods 79 \n\n8.4 \u2013 Comparative Results of Applied Methods at Morro da Gl\u00f3ria Deposit 89 \n\n9 \u2013 Conclusions 96 \n\n \n\n\n\nxv \n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \n\nORDINARY KRIGING AND CONDITIONAL SIMULATION TO SUPPORTING \n\nQUANTITATIVE ESTIMATION AND CLASSIFICATION OF RESOURCES AT THE \n\nLAMEGO GOLD DEPOSIT \u2013 QUADRIL\u00c1TERO FERR\u00cdFERO - BRAZIL  \n \n\nSummary 99  \n\n1 - Historical Data 101  \n\n2 - Mineral Resources 102  \n\n2.1 \u2013 Database  103  \n\n2.2 - QA/QC 104  \n\n2.3 - Density Calculation 107  \n\n2.4 - Geological Modelling 107  \n\n2.5 \u2013 Geostatistical Estimation 109  \n\n2.5.1 - Data Exploration 110  \n\n2.5.2 - Variography \u2013 Variogram Fitting and Analysis 116  \n\n2.5.3 - Estimation by Ordinary Kriging 118 \n\n2.6 \u2013 Grade Tonnage Curve 129 \n\n2.7 - Mineral Resources Classification 130 \n\n3 - Conclusions 142 \n\n \n\nCAPITULO 3  \n\nCONCLUS\u00d5ES FINAIS E PRINCIPAIS CONTRIBUI\u00c7\u00d5ES 145 \n\n  \n\n4 - References 149 \n\n\n\nxvi \n\n\n\nxvii \n\nLISTA DE FIGURAS \n \n\nINTRODU\u00c7\u00c3O \n\n \n\nFigura 1 Mapa geol\u00f3gico regional simplificado do Cr\u00e1ton do S\u00e3o Francisco, no qual \n\ns\u00e3o destacadas a borda do cintur\u00e3o orogen\u00e9tico Brasiliano e o distrito do \n\nQuadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero.

Um exerc\u00edcio \n\ncomplementar na regi\u00e3o de Morro de Gl\u00f3ria foi desenvolvido e fundamentado na integra\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nan\u00e1lise espacial tridimensional de dados multi-fonte, priorizando o uso de algoritmos de l\u00f3gica \n\nfuzzy e invers\u00e3o geof\u00edsica, que auxiliaram na localiza\u00e7\u00e3o e hierarquiza\u00e7\u00e3o de corpos aur\u00edferos \n\npotenciais do dep\u00f3sito Morro da Gl\u00f3ria. \n\n No segundo cap\u00edtulo, intitulado \u201cKrigagem Ordin\u00e1ria e Simula\u00e7\u00e3o Condicional como \n\nSuporte na Estimativa, Categoriza\u00e7\u00e3o e Caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o do Dep\u00f3sito de Ouro do Lamego - \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\nQuadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero \u2013 Brasil\u201d, s\u00e3o apresentados resultados da avalia\u00e7\u00e3o dos recursos \n\nminerais do projeto Lamego obtidos atrav\u00e9s de um conjunto de procedimentos geoestat\u00edsticos que \n\nsuportaram a estimativa dos teores e volumes dos corpos de min\u00e9rio, al\u00e9m da classifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos \n\nrecursos minerais em medidos, indicados e inferidos, definidos com base nos resultados da \n\nsimula\u00e7\u00e3o condicional gaussiana. As principais etapas dos desenvolvimentos aplicados nesse \n\ncap\u00edtulo foram: modelagem geol\u00f3gica tridimensional dos corpos de min\u00e9rio, m\u00e9todos de QA/QC, \n\nestudo explorat\u00f3rio da base de dados, incluindo estudos das m\u00e9dias das vari\u00e1veis, an\u00e1lise dos \n\nhistogramas de freq\u00fc\u00eancia, estudo bi-variante entre as vari\u00e1veis ouro e enxofre, ajuste e an\u00e1lise de \n\nvariogramas direcionais, defini\u00e7\u00e3o de efeito pepita, defini\u00e7\u00e3o dos par\u00e2metros para aplica\u00e7\u00e3o na \n\nkrigagem ordin\u00e1ria, valida\u00e7\u00e3o da krigagem ordin\u00e1ria, classifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos recursos baseada nos \n\nresultados obtidos na simula\u00e7\u00e3o condicional e composi\u00e7\u00e3o de uma an\u00e1lise de como os resultados \n\ngeoestat\u00edsticos podem contribuir no aprimoramento do entendimento do Dep\u00f3sito. \n\nJustificativas \n\nO dep\u00f3sito Lamego \u00e9 considerado um dos principais dep\u00f3sitos de ouro do Quadril\u00e1tero \n\nFerr\u00edfero. O conhecimento geol\u00f3gico e geof\u00edsico detalhado desse dep\u00f3sito em superf\u00edcie e sub-\n\nsuperf\u00edcie \u00e9 cr\u00edtico na medida em que pode proporcionar avan\u00e7os em modelos metalogen\u00e9ticos e \n\norientar a explora\u00e7\u00e3o de dep\u00f3sitos de ouro em terrenos greenstone belt Arqueanos no mundo \n\ntodo.  \n\nAlinhado a essas quest\u00f5es, a import\u00e2ncia de se compor uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o emp\u00edrica de rochas \n\ncom diferentes propor\u00e7\u00f5es de materiais sulfetados com as respectivas intensidades de sinais \n\ngeof\u00edsicos tamb\u00e9m motivam este estudo, e podem adicionalmente contribuir em pesquisas \n\nexplorat\u00f3rias em regi\u00f5es geologicamente pouco conhecidas, atrav\u00e9s dos m\u00e9todos indiretos de \n\ninvestiga\u00e7\u00e3o aplicados e desenvolvidos neste trabalho. \n\nAl\u00e9m disso, os controles das incertezas associadas \u00e0 variabilidade dos teores de ouro, bem \n\ncomo as varia\u00e7\u00f5es expressivas da geometria e espessura dos corpos de min\u00e9rio, necessitam ser \n\ncuidadosamente quantificados, principalmente para serem ponderados em uma etapa de \n\ndeclara\u00e7\u00e3o formal de recursos minerais baseados em c\u00f3digos internacionais de minera\u00e7\u00e3o, como \n\npor exemplo, o Australasian Jorc Code.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nContexto da Pesquisa  \n\n \n\nO QF representa um terreno granito-greenstone coberto por seq\u00fc\u00eancias supracrustais \n\nProteroz\u00f3icas e est\u00e1 situado na por\u00e7\u00e3o sul do Cr\u00e1ton do S\u00e3o Francisco (Figura 1). A sua lito-\n\nestratigrafia pode ser dividida em cinco unidades principais (Dorr 1969, Alkmim &amp; Marshak \n\n1998). Estas incluem, da base para o topo, (i) os terrenos granito-gn\u00e1issicos de idade arqueana, \n\ncom intrus\u00f5es gran\u00edticas, pegmatitos e diques m\u00e1ficos; (ii) o Supergrupo Rio das Velhas, que \n\ncompreende uma seq\u00fc\u00eancia do tipo greenstone belt arqueana; (iii) o Supergrupo Minas, uma \n\ncobertura plataformal do Paleoproteroz\u00f3ico, contendo rochas metassedimentares cl\u00e1sticas e \n\nqu\u00edmicas; (iv) o Grupo Itacolomi e o Supergrupo Espinha\u00e7o, ambos de idade mesoproteroz\u00f3ica e \n\ncompostos de rochas metassedimentares cl\u00e1sticas. A forma quadrangular da regi\u00e3o, que gerou o \n\nnome QF, \u00e9 delineada pela distribui\u00e7\u00e3o das rochas metassedimentares do Supergrupo Minas.  \n\nO Supergrupo Rio das Velhas hospeda as principais mineraliza\u00e7\u00f5es aur\u00edferas do QF, \n\nenquanto o Supergrupo Minas cont\u00e9m dep\u00f3sitos de ferro, mangan\u00eas, calc\u00e1rio e alum\u00ednio. A \n\nunidade basal do Supergrupo Minas, o Grupo Cara\u00e7a, tamb\u00e9m encerra potencial geol\u00f3gico \n\naur\u00edfero, pois compreende quartzitos, quartzo xistos e meta-conglomerados do tipo \n\nWitwatersrand. \n\nO Supergrupo Rio das Velhas foi formalmente subdividido Dorr et al. (1957) and Dorr \n\n(1969) nos Grupos Nova Lima a Maquin\u00e9 e corresponde a uma seq\u00fc\u00eancia arqueana do tipo \n\ngreenstone belt. O Grupo Nova Lima corresponde a uma unidade metavulcano-sedimentar basal \n\ndo Supergrupo Rio das Velhas. Segundo estratigrafia proposta pela CPRM/DNPM (1994), na \n\nregi\u00e3o de Sabar\u00e1, Caet\u00e9 e Nova Lima, que engloba os dep\u00f3sitos do Lamego, Morro da Gl\u00f3ria e a \n\nmina de Cuiab\u00e1, o Grupo Nova Lima compreende (i) uma Unidade Basal, formada \n\nessencialmente por rochas meta-ultrab\u00e1sicas intercaladas a meta-b\u00e1sicas, al\u00e9m de raras meta-\n\n\u00e1cidas e lentes e camadas esparsas de BIFs; (ii) uma Unidade Intermedi\u00e1ria, com metavulc\u00e2nicas \n\nb\u00e1sicas e intermedi\u00e1rias intercaladas a metavulc\u00e2nicas \u00e1cidas, metafufos \u00e1cidos, pelitos, BIFs, \n\nmetacherts e xistos carbonosos; e (iii) uma Unidade Superior, com rochas metavolcanicl\u00e1sticas \n\n\u00e1cidas a intermedi\u00e1rias e metaepicl\u00e1sticas (pelitos e grauvacas) (Figura 2). \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\n \nFigura 1: Mapa geol\u00f3gico regional simplificado do Cr\u00e1ton do S\u00e3o Francisco, no qual s\u00e3o \n\ndestacadas a borda do cintur\u00e3o orogen\u00e9tico Brasiliano e o distrito do Quadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero. \n\nAdaptado de Alkmim &amp; Marshak (1998) em Santos Sales &amp; Holcombe (2004). \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\n \nFigura 2: Mapa geol\u00f3gico regional do Quadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero (CPRM/UFMG/Companhias Associadas, \n\n2005) combinado com dados do SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, 2006). \n\n \n\nEstudos geol\u00f3gicos detalhados sobre os dep\u00f3sitos Cuiab\u00e1 e Lamego s\u00e3o apresentados por \n\nLobatto &amp; Vieira (1998) e Santos Sales (1998). Lobatto &amp; Vieira (1998) discutem os estilos de \n\naltera\u00e7\u00e3o hidrotermal e a metalogenia da mina de Cuiab\u00e1 e de outros dep\u00f3sitos aur\u00edferos do QF. \n\nAmbos os dep\u00f3sitos est\u00e3o hospedados no Grupo Nova Lima. O Grupo Nova Lima \u00e9 uma das \n\nunidades supracrustais mais estudadas no Brasil devido aos in\u00fameros dep\u00f3sitos e ocorr\u00eancias \n\naur\u00edferas hospedados em forma\u00e7\u00e3o ferr\u00edfera bandada, destacando-se as minas de Morro Velho, \n\nCuiab\u00e1, S\u00e3o Bento e Raposos. \n\n Similarmente a outras prov\u00edncias aur\u00edferas em terrenos granito-greenstone, como a do \n\nAbitibi (Canad\u00e1) e a de Yilgarn (Austr\u00e1lia), o Supergrupo Rio das Velhas e os dep\u00f3sitos de ouro \n\nque hospeda tem idade neoarqueana. J\u00e1 em Barberton (\u00c1frica do Sul), um cr\u00e0ton mais antigo, os \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\ndep\u00f3sitos de ouro s\u00e3o, de modo geral, hospedados em conglomerados arqueanos de bacias \n\ntectonicamente est\u00e1veis, e n\u00e3o em seq\u00fc\u00eancias de xistos verdes de terrenos greenstone belts.  \n\n As centenas de ocorr\u00eancias individuais de ouro no Supergrupo Rio das Velhas tornam esta \n\nregi\u00e3o uma prov\u00edncia aur\u00edfera de classe mundial. A maioria dos corpos de min\u00e9rio apresenta \n\ndimens\u00f5es entre 10 e 300m ao longo da dire\u00e7\u00e3o da folia\u00e7\u00e3o regional, 0.5 a 20m de espessura e de \n\n800 a mais de 3000m de extens\u00e3o (down-plunge). Similarmente a outros terrenos arqueanos, o \n\nQF possui uma concentra\u00e7\u00e3o not\u00e1vel de dep\u00f3sitos pequenos e m\u00e9dios (0,1 a 10t Au) (e.g., oeste \n\nda Austr\u00e1lia, Prov\u00edncia Superior, Zimbabwe). A maioria dos dep\u00f3sitos possui reservas aur\u00edferas \n\ninferiores \u00e0 1 tonelada, geralmente por volta de 100kg. Entre os dep\u00f3sitos pequenos est\u00e3o \n\nC\u00f3rrego do S\u00edtio, Lamego, Faria, Esperan\u00e7a III, Bicalho, Bela Fama, Juca Vieira, Brumal, Boa \n\nVista, Fernandes, Moita, Ro\u00e7a Grande, Bico de Pedra e Pari (Vial et al. 2007). Os dep\u00f3sitos de \n\nRaposos, S\u00e3o Bento e Passagem de Mariana s\u00e3o exemplos de dep\u00f3sitos de porte intermedi\u00e1rio. \n\nMorro Velho (455 ton produzidas) e Cuiab\u00e1 s\u00e3o dep\u00f3sitos de grande porte, compar\u00e1veis aos \n\nmaiores e de mais alto teor conhecidos mundialmente. \n\n Todos estes dep\u00f3sitos s\u00e3o, em maior ou menor grau, estruturalmente controlados, \n\nrelacionados a zonas de cisalhamento, dobramentos e/ou interse\u00e7\u00f5es de elementos estruturais. Sua \n\ncontinuidade, segundo a dire\u00e7\u00e3o do mergulho, \u00e9 uma fei\u00e7\u00e3o recorrente para a maioria dos \n\nmesmos.  \n\n As mineraliza\u00e7\u00f5es dos dep\u00f3sitos aur\u00edferos do QF foram agrupadas por Vial et al. (2007) \n\nem seis tipos: (1) Lapa Seca: Morro Velho, Bicalho, Bela Fama; (2) Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Ferr\u00edfera Bandada: \n\nCuiab\u00e1, S\u00e3o Bento, Raposos, Faria, Brumal, Ro\u00e7a Grande; (3) Veios de quartzo: Juca Vieira e \n\nFernandes; (4) Sulfetos disseminados com v\u00eanulas de quartzo (Moita); (5) Anfibolitos: Pari; e (6) \n\nSulfetos de metais-base disseminados a maci\u00e7os: Bico de Pedra. O dep\u00f3sito do Lamego se \n\nencaixa no grupo 2, apesar de parte expressiva da mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o ocorrer hospedada em \n\n\u201cmetachert\u201d. \n\nAs Geotecnologias v\u00eam sendo aplicadas na academia e ind\u00fastria mineral em projetos de \n\npesquisa desde a d\u00e9cada de 70. Fornece, no s\u00e9culo XXI, uma forte contribui\u00e7\u00e3o para o aux\u00edlio no \n\nentendimento geol\u00f3gico de prov\u00edncias metalogen\u00e9ticas e dep\u00f3sitos minerais distribu\u00eddos por todo \n\no mundo.  Isso foi poss\u00edvel em fun\u00e7\u00e3o da evolu\u00e7\u00e3o dos mecanismos computacionais, avan\u00e7os \n\nprogressivos de mem\u00f3ria e capacidade de processamento dos computadores, aliado ao progresso \n\nde algoritmos de diversas naturezas e software de processamento de dados espaciais e avalia\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde recursos minerais.  \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nProcessos de invers\u00e3o geof\u00edsica t\u00eam sido aplicados em diversos dep\u00f3sitos minerais nos \n\n\u00faltimos anos com o objetivo de (i) estimar a profundidade de corpos condutores \n\neletromagn\u00e9ticos, magn\u00e9ticos ou com propriedades f\u00edsicas distintas; (ii) definir melhor os limites \n\nde abrang\u00eancia lateral e longitudinal de dom\u00ednios mineralizados; e (iii) auxiliar em pesquisas \n\nexplorat\u00f3rias, principalmente de metais base, ouro e ferro. Li &amp; Oldenburg (2003) discutiram \n\nhistoricamente a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o do processo de invers\u00e3o atrav\u00e9s de m\u00e9todos de barreiras logar\u00edtmicas \n\nusando gradientes conjugados. Phillips et al. (2001) aplicaram processos de invers\u00e3o geof\u00edsica ao \n\ndep\u00f3sito de sulfeto massivo vulcanog\u00eanio a cobre-zinco de San Nicolas no M\u00e9xico. Esses autores \n\nmostraram que os resultados da invers\u00e3o de dados de magnetometria terrestre, polariza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ninduzida (IP) e gravimetria s\u00e3o capazes de caracterizar, com sucesso, a geometria dos principais \n\ncorpos mineralizados. Silva et al. (2001) demonstram a import\u00e2ncia de se utilizar modelos de \n\nrefer\u00eancia definindo-se limites confinantes ao processo de invers\u00e3o. Esses limites podem se \n\nreferir, por exemplo, a dom\u00ednios litol\u00f3gicos tridimensionais conhecidos que possuem \n\ncaracter\u00edsticas f\u00edsicas compat\u00edveis com o m\u00e9todo geof\u00edsico aplicado. Esses limites auxiliam na \n\nfiltragem da n\u00e3o unicidade das solu\u00e7\u00f5es fornecidas no processo de invers\u00e3o. Dentith (2003) \n\npublicou um conjunto de assinaturas geof\u00edsicas de dep\u00f3sitos minerais australianos, o que \n\nrepresentou um marco na geof\u00edsica da Austr\u00e1lia no come\u00e7o da \u00faltima d\u00e9cada. Dos 21 casos \n\nhist\u00f3ricos apresentados, 9 usaram invers\u00e3o geof\u00edsica e produziram resultados significativos. \n\nOldenburg &amp; Pratt (2007) contribu\u00edram com uma completa an\u00e1lise da aplica\u00e7\u00e3o do processo de \n\ninvers\u00e3o geof\u00edsica, caracterizando, na teoria e na pr\u00e1tica, detalhes de procedimentos de invers\u00e3o \n\nna explora\u00e7\u00e3o mineral. Segundo os autores, a \u00faltima d\u00e9cada foi marcada por grandes avan\u00e7os no \n\nprocesso de invers\u00e3o de v\u00e1rios tipos de dados geof\u00edsicos. Os avan\u00e7os foram promovidos \n\nprincipalmente pelo desenvolvimento de otimiza\u00e7\u00f5es matem\u00e1ticas, visualiza\u00e7\u00e3o e poder \n\ncomputacional. Para o problema da invers\u00e3o na explora\u00e7\u00e3o mineral, Oldenburg &amp; Pratt (2007) \n\nseparam tr\u00eas grandes categorias: Tipo I: invers\u00e3o de corpos discretos, Tipo II: invers\u00e3o pura da \n\npropriedade e Tipo III: invers\u00e3o litol\u00f3gica. \n\nJ\u00e1 a an\u00e1lise fuzzy neste trabalho tem o objetivo de selecionar, qualitativamente, atrav\u00e9s de \n\noperadores fuzzy aplicados aos dados multi-fonte, \u00e1reas e s\u00f3lidos tridimensionais em superf\u00edcie e \n\nsubsolo, para hierarquizar dom\u00ednios aur\u00edferos j\u00e1 conhecidos e localizar novos potenciais para \n\ninvestiga\u00e7\u00e3o. A teoria da l\u00f3gica fuzzy (Bonham-Carter, 1994) comporta uma escala cont\u00ednua de \n\npertin\u00eancia aos conjuntos de dados estudados, variando de 1.0 (pertin\u00eancia total) at\u00e9 0.0 (n\u00e3o-\n\npertin\u00eancia total). Desta maneira, medi\u00e7\u00f5es individuais de uma vari\u00e1vel podem ser classificadas \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nde acordo com o grau de pertin\u00eancia ao conjunto \"Anomalia\" (Bonham-Carter, 1994). Valores \n\nmuito altos ser\u00e3o certamente an\u00f4malos, possuindo uma pertin\u00eancia fuzzy (fuzzy membership) \n\n\u201cum\u201d, enquanto valores muito baixos ou abaixo do background ter\u00e3o pertin\u00eancia fuzzy \u201czero\u201d. \n\nEntre estes dois extremos existe toda uma faixa de poss\u00edveis valores de pertin\u00eancia. A \n\ncombina\u00e7\u00e3o entre os mapas de evid\u00eancias foi estabelecida atrav\u00e9s de operadores fuzzy descritos \n\nem An et al. (1991) e Bonham-Carter (1994). Exemplos da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o da l\u00f3gica fuzzy em pesquisa \n\nmineral s\u00e3o fartamente encontrados na literatura (e.g., An et al. 1991; Bonham-Carter et al. 1988; \n\nBonham-Carter 1994; Bonham-Carter 1997; Braghin 1998; Chinn &amp; Ascough 1997, N\u00f3brega \n\n2001, Nyk\u00e4nen 2008).  \n\nNo primeiro cap\u00edtulo \u00e9 apresentada uma tabela sumarizada com um conjunto de resultados \n\nquantitativos referentes \u00e0s intensidades dos sinais de geof\u00edsica a\u00e9rea e terrestre dos principais \n\ncorpos sulfetados do dep\u00f3sito Lamego e dos alvos sat\u00e9lites. Atrav\u00e9s desta tabela foi poss\u00edvel \n\nestabelecer caracter\u00edsticas espec\u00edficas que associam as informa\u00e7\u00f5es de concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de teores de \n\nsulfetos em cada corpo de min\u00e9rio estudado, com as respectivas intensidades dos sinais de \n\ncondutividade eletromagn\u00e9tica, efeito IP e resistividade DC. Com essa caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o, as \n\nmetodologias de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o desenvolvidas neste trabalho podem auxiliar em pesquisas \n\nexplorat\u00f3rias em \u00e1reas que ainda o conhecimento geol\u00f3gico \u00e9 embrion\u00e1rio ou em \u00e1reas onde o \n\nconjunto de informa\u00e7\u00f5es explorat\u00f3rias \u00e9 escasso.  \n\nOs resultados obtidos na regi\u00e3o do dep\u00f3sito Morro da Gl\u00f3ria ponderados pela \n\nmetodologia das m\u00faltiplas se\u00e7\u00f5es horizontais, submetidas aos operadores de l\u00f3gica fuzzy, \n\napresentaram uma correla\u00e7\u00e3o geom\u00e9trica tridimensional bastante significativa com o produto do \n\nprocesso de invers\u00e3o geof\u00edsica de dados EM, embora em n\u00edveis de escala ou resolu\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ndiferenciados.

The mineralization is hosted by \n\nNeoArchean rocks at the base of the Rio das Velhas Supergroup (greenstone belt) and is of \n\norogenic type. The stratigraphic succession of the deposit is composed of rocks metamorphosed \n\nat green schist facies. This succession includes, from base to top: metamafic rocks, banded iron \n\nformation (BIF), gray quartz veins (as stratabound, boudinaged and irregular masses), \n\ncarbonaceous schist, pelitic schist, and volcanoclastic schist. The deposit is comprised in an \n\nanticline with some 4.8km perimeter, axis oriented towards NE and flanks dipping 20\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 \n\nESE. The mineralization is divided into the Carruagem, Arco da Velha, Queimada, and Cabe\u00e7a \n\nde Pedra orebodies, which are hosted by hydrothermally altered BIFs and gray quartz veins. Gold \n\noccurs in pyrite and in free form. The gold mineralization is structurally controlled and related to \n\nhydrothermal alteration. The alteration includes areas of chloritization, carbonatization and \n\nsericitization, predominantly observed in metamafic rocks. Sulphidation (mainly pyrite) is \n\nrecorded in BIFs and, subordinately, in gray quartz veins and carbonaceous schist. \n\nThe Lamego deposit and surrounding areas were surveyed in 2002 by an Airborne \n\nElectromagnetic System (Spectrem). Later, in 2007, the same area was covered by resistivity and \n\ninduced polarization (IP) ground surveys.  \n\nThis chapter presents the results of the geophysical inversion of data from these two \n\nsurveys, combined with geological and geochemical data. The study provides a characterization \n\nof the geophysical signatures of known sulphide bodies at the Lamego deposit and an estimation \n\nof the depth and possible lateral extensions of orebodies, considering their electromagnetic, \n\nresistive and/or geoelectric conductive responses. These signatures were used to investigate a \n\nlarger area around Lamego, making it possible to expand the pool of potential sites for gold in the \n\nform of smaller satellite targets. \n\nGeophysical inversion in mineral exploration is divided into three categories: Type I - \n\ninversion of discrete bodies; Type II - pure or direct inversion of the property; and Type III - \n\nlithological inversion. Type II inversion was used in this research as three dimensional geological \n\nmodels were not employed as a reference for adjusting the direct inversion product. The sections \n\nof resistivity and chargeability (voltage decay) were generated from algorithms that use the finite \n\nelement method in 2D, although topography was also incorporated in the data modeling. The \n\nproduct of the inversion of both surveys suggests individualized correlations with known \n\norebodies of the Lamego deposit, and indicates some potential anomalies that are geologically \n\nconsistent. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\n1 - INTRODUCTION \n\nThe Quadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero (QF), located in State of Minas Gerais, is one of the largest \n\nmetal-bearing regions in the world.  It hosts a large number of mines that have produced \n\nthousands of tons of gold since the 18\nth\n\n century. Major gold-bearing deposits such as Mina \n\nGrande, Cuiab\u00e1 and Raposos are considered gigantic (>250t Au) and world class (>100t Au) \n\n(Groves et al. 2005). Other smaller deposits (Lamego, Faria, Bicalho, Engenho, D\u00b4\u00e1gua and \n\nMorro da Gl\u00f3ria), are found in the central-northern area of the Rio das Velhas Supergroup (Dorr \n\nII 1969).   \n\nThe orogenic Lamego gold deposits, owned by AngloGold Ashanti Brasil Minera\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nLtda., are located in the N-NW portion of the Archean-Paleoproterozoic metallogenic province of \n\nthe Quadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero (QF). This province is a historical gold, iron, manganese, and bauxite \n\nproducing region, among other mineral assets, with a combined gold production of over 800 \n\ntonnes of metal. The Lamego deposit, which is currently at the pre-feasibility stage, is located 7.5 \n\nkm southeast of the city of Sabar\u00e1 and 13 km southeast of Cuiab\u00e1 gold mine (Figure 1). \n\n \nFigure 1: Location map and access to the Lamego deposit in the Minas Gerais State.  \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\nGeological studies of Lamego deposit are presented by Santos Sales (1998) and \n\nGuimar\u00e3es et al. (2008).  Lobatto &amp; Vieira (1998) discuss the styles of hydrothermal alteration \n\nand metallogeny of the Cuiab\u00e1 mine and other gold deposits in the Quadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero. These \n\ndeposits are hosted by Nova Lima Group rocks - a basal metavolcanic-sedimentary unit of the \n\nArchean Rio das Velhas Supergroup, which comprises a greenstone belt sequence. The Nova \n\nLima Group is a vastly studied supracrustal unit in Brazil due to the numerous gold-bearing \n\ndeposits and occurrences hosted in banded iron formations, especially in the Morro Velho, \n\nCuiab\u00e1, S\u00e3o Bento and Raposos mines.  \n\nThis work aims to portray the geological, geochemical and geophysical signatures of the \n\nLamego gold deposit by means of inversion methods. The knowledge acquired from Lamego is \n\nalso used to enhance regional mineral prospectivity modeling of similar deposits and assessment \n\nof possibly new mineral resources. Satellite targets denominated S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9, Biquinha, Sobradinho, \n\nBom Caminho and Morro da Gl\u00f3ria were also approached by ancillary data integration and \n\nfurther investigation by IP geophysical sections and drilling campaigns.  \n\nThe investigation is strongly based on results yielded by geophysical data inversion \n\nacquired during two geophysical surveys: the Airborne Electromagnetic System (SPECTREM), \n\nflown in 2002, and resistivity and induced polarization (IP) ground surveys conducted in 2007.  \n\nAdditionally, this study provides a characterization of the geophysical signatures of \n\nknown sulphide bodies at the Lamego deposit and an estimation of the depth and possible lateral \n\nextensions of orebodies, considering their electromagnetic, resistive and/or geoelectric conductive \n\nresponses. These signatures were used to investigate a larger area around Lamego, making it \n\npossible to expand the pool of potential sites for gold in the form of smaller satellite targets. \n\nGeophysical inversion has been implemented using the database of various mineral \n\ndeposits in recent years with multiple objectives, including: (i) estimation of the depth of \n\nelectromagnetic, magnetic conducting bodies or those with different physical properties, (ii) \n\nbetter definition of lateral and longitudinal borders of the mineralized areas; (iii) assistance of \n\nmineral exploration projects, with focus on base metals, gold and iron. Li &amp; Oldenburg (2003) \n\ndiscuss the historical evolution of the inversion process through the Logarithmic Barrier Method, \n\nusing conjugated gradients. Phillips et al. (2001) applied geophysical inversion processes to the \n\nmassive volcanogenic sulphide copper-zinc deposit in San Nicolas, Mexico. These authors \n\nshowed that the results of the inversion of the land magnetometry data, induced polarization (IP) \n\nand gravimetry successively characterized the geometry of the main mineralized bodies. \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nAdditionally, a complementary study in Morro da Gl\u00f3ria gold deposit was developed to \n\ncompare the geophysical inversion results against a 3D fuzzy logic analysis considering modeled \n\ngold orebodies, soil and stream sediments campaigns and information related to the geometry of \n\nold excavations. This study assisted in the consolidation of prospective detailed models of Morro \n\nda Gl\u00f3ria auriferous mineralization based on the integration and 3D analysis of multi-source data \n\nconsidering fuzzy logic and geophysical inversion algorithms, providing new potential lateral  \n\nextension in this deposit. \n\nSpecific objectives of this study are summarized below: \n\n1 \u2013  To detail the local geology of the Lamego and Morro da Gl\u00f3ria gold deposits, besides \n\nfour satellite targets, through geological mapping and integration of old available data. \n\n2 \u2013  To characterize the signal intensity of induced polarization (IP), resistivity and airborne \n\nelectromagnetic (EM) signatures of the sulfide-bearing host rocks of the Lamego gold deposit, \n\nconsidering three dimensional geologic and geochemistry modeling of the orebodies, \n\nassociated with products yielded by the direct inversion of the aforementioned geophysical \n\nproperties; \n\n3 \u2013  To locate possible lateral extensions and depth of potential sulfide bodies containing gold \n\nmineralization associated with the Lamego deposit; \n\n4 \u2013  To investigate, in depth, the continuity of soil anomalies and excavations of the satellite \n\ntargets through geophysical sections, which may help in the position of drilling and locating \n\npotential gold deposits in the north-northwest region of the Quadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero  (Rio das \n\nVelhas Supergroup); \n\n5 \u2013 To establish a methodological criteria for mineral exploration by IP geophysics and three-\n\ndimensional integration of multi-source data; \n\n6 \u2013 To employ the geophysical inversion methodology used in the Lamego deposit in satellite \n\ntargets; \n\n7 \u2013 To tabulate the main characteristics of geophysical signatures of all surveyed orebodies of \n\nLamego deposit and satellite targets in order to associate with different proportions of sulfides \n\nand lithologies.  \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\n8 \u2013 To develop the mineral resource evaluation of Lamego gold deposit based on both \n\nordinary kriging and conditional simulation methods to supporting quantitative estimation, \n\ncharacterization and mineral resource classification. \n\n9 \u2013 To consider metallogentic issues of the studied areas based on the results of the ordinary \n\nkriging analysis and association with geophysical results. \n\n \n\n2 \u2013 REGIONAL GEOLOGY \n\nThe Quadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero (QF) is located in the southern portion of S\u00e3o Francisco Craton \n\n(Figure 2) and comprises Archean granite-greenstone terranes overlain by Proterozoic \n\nsupracrustal sequences. Its stratigraphy can be divided into five main units (Dorr II 1969, Alkmim \n\n&amp; Marshak 1998), and includes, from base to top, Archean granite-gneiss terranes with granite \n\nintrusions, pegmatites and mafic dykes; the Archean Rio das Velhas Supergroup, which is a \n\nclassic greenstone-belt sequence; the Paleoproterozoic Minas Supergroup, which is a platformal \n\ncover containing clastic and chemical metasedimentary rocks; and the mesoproterozoic Itacolomi \n\nGroup and Espinha\u00e7o Supergroup, composed of clastic metasedimentary rocks. The QF region is \n\nnamed after its quadrangular shape, which is distinguished by the metasedimentary rock \n\ndistribution of the Minas Supergroup.  \n\nThe Rio das Velhas Supergroup was formally subdivided by Dorr et al. (1957) and Dorr \n\n(1969) into the older Nova Lima Group and the younger Maquin\u00e9 Group.    \n\nAccording to the stratigraphy proposed by Zucchetti et al. (1996), in the Sabar\u00e1-Caet\u00e9 \n\nregion \u2013 where the Lamego deposits and the Cuiab\u00e1 mine are located \u2013 the Nova Lima \n\nSupergroup comprises a Basal Unit formed essentially by intermixed meta-ultrabasic and \n\nmetabasic rocks, as well as rare meta-acidic rocks, lenses, and sparse layers of banded iron \n\nformations (BIFs); an Intermediate Unit, consisting of basic and intermediate metavolcanic rocks \n\nintermixed with acidic metavolcanic rocks, acidic meta-tuffs, pelites, BIFs, gray quartz veins, and \n\ncarbonaceous schists; and an Upper Unit, comprising acidic to intermediate metavolcaniclastic \n\nand meta-epiclastic rocks (pelites and graywackes) (Figure 3). \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2: Simplified regional map of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton showing the bordering Brasiliano \n\norogenic belts and the Quadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero. Adapted from Alkmim &amp; Marshak (1998) and \n\nSantos Sales &amp; Holcombe (2004). \n\nThe Rio das Velhas Supergroup hosts the major gold mineralizations of the QF, whereas \n\nthe Minas Supergroup contains iron, manganese, limestone and aluminum deposits. \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3: Regional geological map of the Quadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero (CPRM 2005), merged to Shuttle \n\nRadar Topography Mission (SRTM 2006) data in the background.\n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\nTectonic Evolution \n\nBased on a review of geochronological and geological data, Lobato et al. (2001) proposed \n\nthe following succession of tectonic events for the QF:  \n\n1. Main period of crustal growth prior to 2.9 Ga, followed by several short, episodic \n\ntectonic events from 2860 to 2600 Ma. The first occurred at 2860 Ma and involved \n\nmigmatization of old TTG terranes; \n\n2. Evolution of the Rio das Velhas greenstone belt, associated with tectono-\n\nmetamorphic and magmatic events from 2780 to 2700 Ma; \n\n3. Cratonization and sedimentation on stable platform followed by intrusion of \n\ngranites at 2600 Ma. Platform sedimentation of carbonates at 2400 Ma, indicating a \n\nlong period of tectonic stability; \n\n4. Transamazonian Orogeny involving consumption of oceanic crust and generation \n\nof mantle-related tonalites and trondjemites from 2162 to 2124 Ma, followed by \n\nintrusion of syn- to late-collisional granites of crustal derivation, and foreland-basin-\n\ntype sedimentation. The collapse of the orogen led to the development of structures of \n\nthe dome-and-keel type, which is the prevailing structure in the QF (Alkmim &amp; \n\nMarshak 1998). U-Pb ages of titanites between 2060 and 2030 Ma define the period \n\nof this final phase of crustal distension; \n\n5. Post-Transamazonian events had a minor impact on the tectonic evolution of the \n\nQF.  \n\nGlobal Metallogenetic Aspects  \n\nSimilarly to other gold provinces in granite-greenstone terranes, such as the Abitibi in \n\nCanada and the Yilgarn in Australia, the Rio das Velhas Supergroup is of Neoarchean age. In the \n\nolder Barberton greenstone belt (South Africa), the gold deposits are, in general, hosted by \n\nArchean conglomerates in tectonically stable basins, rather than by greenstone sequences. \n\nHundreds of individual gold occurrences in the Rio das Velhas Supergroup make this \n\nregion a world class gold province. Most of the orebodies are 10m to 300m in length along the \n\nstrike, 0.5m to 20m wide, and extend 800m to >3000m down plunge. Similarly to other Archean \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\nterranes (e.g., Western Australia, and the Upper Province in Zimbabwe), the QF shows a \n\nremarkable concentration of small- and medium-size deposits (0.1 to 10t Au). For most of such \n\ndeposits, reserves are of less than 1 ton, usually around 100kg. Among the small-size deposits are \n\nC\u00f3rrego do S\u00edtio, Lamego, Faria, Esperan\u00e7a III, Bicalho, Bela Fama, Juca Vieira, Brumal, Boa \n\nVista, Fernandes, Moita, Ro\u00e7a Grande, Bico de Pedra, and Pari (Vial et al. 2007), whereas \n\nRaposos, S\u00e3o Bento and Passagem de Mariana are examples of medium-size deposits, and Morro \n\nVelho (455 tons produced) and Cuiab\u00e1 are world-class deposits (Figure 4). \n\n \nFigure 4 \u2013 Simplified geological map of the Quadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero showing the location of the \n\nmain gold deposits. The Lamego deposit is indicated by number 3. \n\n \n\nAll these deposits are structurally controlled and related to shear zones, folds, and/or \n\nintersections of structural elements. Extensive down-plunge continuity is a consistent feature of \n\nmost of the deposits.  \n\nVial et al. (2007) grouped the gold deposits of the QF into six types: (1) Lapa Seca: \n\nMorro Velho, Bicalho, and Bela Fama; (2) Banded iron formation: Cuiab\u00e1, S\u00e3o Bento, Raposos, \n\nFaria, Brumal, and Ro\u00e7a Grande; (3) Quartz veins: Juca Vieira and Fernandes; (4) Disseminated \n\nsulfides with quartz veinlets: Luzia da Mota; (5) Amphibolites: Pari; and (6) Disseminated to \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\ncompact base-metal sulfides: Bico de Pedra. The Lamego deposit fits into type 2, although a \n\nsubstantial portion of the mineralization occurs within gray quartz veins in stratabound layers. \n\nThe hypothesis that the BIF lithotype from Lamego and Cuiab\u00e1 deposits represents a \n\nsingle stratigraphic horizon, located at the contact between middle and upper units of the Nova \n\nLima Group, has important prospective implications. Current knowledge indicates that both \n\nstructures that encompass the Lamego and Cuiab\u00e1 deposits represent surface expressions \n\n(structural windows) of refolded antiforms in the Sabar\u00e1-Caet\u00e9 region (Santos Salles 1998). The \n\npossible existence of 'blind' folded structures (and therefore, hidden orebodies, with no surface \n\nexpression) on a kilometric scale, accessible only by diamond drilling, supported AngloGold \n\nAshanti\u2019s decision, in the late 1990s, to invest in geochemical surveys by stream sediment and \n\nsoil pattern sampling, as well as geophysical (electro-magnetic, magnetic, induced polarization \n\n(IP)), surveys. These enhanced exploration campaigns have given rise to new targets near \n\nLamego, coined Biquinha, Bom Caminho, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9, Sobradinho, and Morro da Gl\u00f3ria. \n\n \n\n3 \u2013 GEOLOGY OF LAMEGO GOLD DEPOSIT \n\nThe stratigraphic sequence found at the Lamego deposit (Figure 5), from base to top, \n\nconsists of mafic to intermediate metavolcanic rocks (hydrothermally altered or not); banded iron \n\nformation - BIF (hydrothermally altered or not) and gray quartz veins; carbonaceous to graphitic \n\nschists, metapelites and felsic metavolcanoclastic rocks. Quartz veins and mafic dykes intersect \n\nand intrude these rocks locally. \n\nThe Lamego deposit is characterized by orebodies associated with banded iron formation \n\n(BIF) and gray quartz veins, in proportions that vary substantially from one orebody to another. \n\nThe mineralized horizons are stratigraphically located above the metamafic rocks and below the \n\ncarbonaceous schists, pelitic schists and metavolcanoclastic rocks.  \n\n3.1 \u2013Structural Geology \n\nThe Lamego deposit is comprised by an overturned isoclinal antiform with its axis \n\ntrending southeast (Figure 5). The antiform has a perimeter of approximately 4,800m and a \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nmaximum width of 450m. Its limbs are oriented along an average strike of N35\u00baE with an average \n\ndip of 25\u00baSE.  \n\nFour orebodies are comprised in this overall structure (Figuras 5 e 6): Arco da Velha in \n\nthe normal limb of the antiform; its counterpart, Queimada in the inverted limb; Cabe\u00e7a de Pedra \n\n(hinge zone); and Carruagem in the northeastern end, where the limbs of the antiform are \n\npractically merged at shallower levels.  \n\nDrill holes have confirmed the continuity of the structure to a depth of at least 550m. \n\nDeeper drilling at Cabe\u00e7a de Pedra and Arco da Velha orebodies indicated a flattening of the \n\ndown-plunge (e.g., 16\u00ba at Arco da Velha orebody). \n\nFaults with a general NW trend truncate a portion of Arco da Velha and Cabe\u00e7a de Pedra \n\norebodies, whereas NS faults locally disrupt part of the mineralized structure at the Carruagem \n\norebody. \n\n \nFigure 5 - Simplified geological map of the Lamego deposit.  HW = hanging wall. FW = \n\nfootwall. \n\n \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\nThe tectonic evolution proposed by Vieira (1991) and Toledo (1997) to explain the \n\nLamego macrostructure consists of a D1 folding phase, followed by a D2 shearing phase. D1 \n\nfolds correspond to non-cylindrical, normal to inclined antiforms.  Anticline axis subparallel to \n\nthe mineral stretching lineation are associated to D2 shearing. The stretching lineation, therefore, \n\ncoincides with the fold axis. Foliation S1 is subparallel to the bedding; S2 is the axial plane of the \n\nmacrostructure, parallel to the western, inverted flank (Queimada). Both foliations developed \n\nconsonantly with shear zones, which function as channelways for ascending hydrothermal fluids.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6 - Wide-angle view of Carruagem and Queimada orebodies (oxidized portion). The large \n\ngray patch in the center-right portion of the picture is the waste pile yielded from underground \n\nmining operations at the Lamego mine.  \n\n \n\nApproximately 134,000 meters of exploratory drilling were undertaken for the Lamego \n\nProject to date in order to properly reveal the structure of the deposit. The amount of drilling \n\nprovides a notion of the geometric complexity of the mineralized zones as described on Chapter \n\n2. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\n3.2 \u2013 Description of Lithologies \n\nAfter conducting an extensive petrographic studies of drilling core samples from several \n\ngold mines hosted by greenstone sequences in the QF, Vieira &amp; Oliveira (1988) named the rocks \n\ncurrently used in core descriptions, both at the mine and outcrops, as follows: \n\n (i) Carbonate-quartz-sericite schist with gray carbonaceous matter (metapelite), locally coined as \n\n\u201cX1\u201d. It occurs at the top of the stratigraphic column, either directly above the carbonaceous \n\nschist (XG) or intermixed with felsic metavolcanoclastic rocks (XS). It occasionally shows \n\ngradational, centimetric to decimetric bedding, with quartz-carbonatic bands that change to \n\nsericitic-carbonaceous bands. It often contains veinlets of quartz (Figure 7A).  \n\n(ii) Carbonate-plagioclase-chlorite-sericite-quartz schist (felsic metavolcanoclastic rock) or \u2018XS\u2019. \n\nThis metavolcanoclastic rock is characterized by fragmented, roundish phenocrysts of \n\nbipyramidal quartz, indicating the occurrence of reworking in a marine environment. Gradational \n\nbedding is common.  \n\n(iii) Quartz-carbonate-sericite carbonaceous black schist or \u2018XG\u2019. This rock has a very fine grain \n\nsize, and when associated with micro-folded quartzose veinlets, shows an anastomosed foliation. \n\nSlicken sides and fault striation is frequent, as well as pressure shadow zones around pyrite \n\nporphyroblasts (Figure 7B).  \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 7 \u2013 Drilling cores: (A) Carbonate-quartz-sericite schist; and (B) Quartz-carbonate-sericite \n\ncarbonaceous black schist.  \n\n \n\n(iv) Banded iron formation (BIF). It is composed of beige quartz-carbonatic bands alternating \n\nwith white to light gray quartzose bands.  The bands are generally centimetric, at times \n\nmillimetric. Carbonaceous films may occur. Quartz-rich levels crop up across the BIF. \n\nSulfidization layers are commonly in all orebodies (Figure 8).  \n\n(v) Gray quartz veins \u201cGQZ\u201d, also interpreted originally as a metachert. These veins appear in \n\nshades of gray to dark gray and are usually compact. They typically display a particular texture \n\nthat resembles jaguar hide. Locally they can be carbonate-rich and/or carbonaceous-rich; in the \n\nlatter, an incipient foliation is observed. Recrystallization and association with quartz veins are \n\nfrequent (Figure 9).  \n\n(vi) Sericite-chlorite-quartz-carbonate schist, or \u2018X2CL\u2019, plus gray schist (carbonatization zone \n\nabove mafic or intermediate rocks). This rock is marked by intercalations of beige sericite-rich \n\nand green chlorite-rich layers, usually showing a discrete foliation. The transition to X2 is \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\ngradational. Both X2 and X2CL can contain carbonatic microporphyroblasts and quartz-\n\ncarbonatic veinlets.  \n\n \nFigure 8 \u2013 Banded iron formation (brown portion) with hydrothermal alteration associated, \n\ncrossed by quartz veins.

Carruagem oreboby. \n\n(vii) Quartz-carbonate-sericite schist, or \u2018X2\u2019. This rock appears in shades of beige and \n\nmaterializes the sericitization zone developed over the metavolcanic rocks. Foliation is incipient \n\nwhere carbonate prevails over sericite.  \n\n(viii) Quartz-carbonate-plagioclase-chlorite schist, or \u2018MANX\u2019. This rock is dark-green and \n\ncorrespond to chloritized metabasalt/andesite (Figure 10). It is marked by medium to pronounced \n\nfoliation and by the presence of post-kinematic calcite porphyroblasts. \n\n(ix) Metabasalt/meta-andesite, or \u2018MAN\u2019. This rock is composed of plagioclase, chlorite, quartz \n\nand actinolite. Albitized basalts occur stratigraphically below the BIF layer, in the center of the \n\nantiform, which makes them similar to andesites. These basalts are compact, occasionally display \n\nvariolitic texture, and are replaced by clinozoisite in an actinolite/tremolite and chlorite matrix.  \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\n(x) Metadiabase, or \u2018MD\u2019. This is a dark green rock, with compact texture and composed of \n\nquartz, plagioclase, actinolite, chlorite and clinozoisite. It occurs in the form of dykes, and its \n\ncoarse texture makes it distinguishable from MAN.  \n\n(xi) Carbonate-quartz-plagioclase-chlorite schist, or \u2018MDX\u2019 (chloritized metadiabase). It occurs \n\nin the form of dykes, and is characterized by pronounced foliation.  \n\n \nFigure 10 \u2013 Contact of metabasaltic rock (top right corner) preserved of hydrothermal alteration, \n\nwith metabasalt submitted at chloritization process.  \n\n3.3 - Hydrothermalism \n\nThe Lamego gold mineralization is associated to an orogenic type, with chloritization, \n\ncarbonatation and sericitization hydrothermal zones dominantly found in metamafic volcanic \n\nrocks, and sulfidization zones in BIF and gray quartz veins. \n\nThe mineral assemblage observed in the regional metamorphism indicates weak \n\nmetamorphism, with temperatures ranging from 350 to 430\u00b0C (Vieira 1991). The regional \n\nmetamorphism contains carbonate as an accessory mineral, and plenty of epidote and actinolite, \n\nwhich indicates small proportions of aqueous fluid. The hydrothermalism is characterized by high \n\nCO2 concentration (plenty of carbonate) and larger proportion of water (absence of epidote and \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\nactinolite, and presence of chlorite, which contains a larger proportion of OH in its structure). K, \n\nS, Au, As, B, and Ba, among other elements, have also been introduced together with H2O and \n\nCO2 during the hydrothermalism (Vieira 1991).  \n\nThe magmatic textures, including pillows and variolites in metabasalts, are largely \n\nobliterated inside the hydrothermal zones. The hydrothermalized rocks are mylonites with \n\nboudinated, sigmoidal, or folded quartz veins. Microscopically, they are characterized by an \n\nanastomosed mylonitic foliation, S-C structures, and rotated, recrystallized poikiloblasts with \n\npressure shadows. The minerals have been elongated and stretched along the main lineation. \n\nQuartz, carbonate and albite show dynamic comminution and recrystallization, notably a growth \n\nof both quartz and carbonate grains (Vieira 1991). Hydrothermalized schists show ductile \n\ndeformation features, whereas in BIFs the deformation is ductile-brittle to ductile. Moreover, \n\nBIFs also show tension gashes, micro-faults with rotated blocks, and breccias.  \n\nThe following hydrothermal zoning at Lamego deposit and its surroundings was \n\ndeveloped above the mafic rocks (Figure 11), associated with D1 deformation phase responsible \n\nfor the antiform macro structure:  \n\n(i) Chloritization zone (MANX): Marked by strong mineral hydration, with transformation of \n\namphibole into chlorite, which is the dominant mineral in the zone. Dynamic recrystallization of \n\nthe plagioclase and discrete carbonatization (replacement of plagioclase by calcite) are also \n\ntypical features of this zone;  \n\n(ii) Carbonatization zone (X2CL): The carbonate, which is the dominant mineral, becomes richer \n\nin iron, ankerite or ferroan dolomite, being a product of plagioclase transformation. Discrete \n\nsericitization, turmalinization and sulfidization also occur within this zone; \n\n(iii) Sericitization zone (X2): Sericite, the ubiquitous mineral in this zone, occurs in association \n\nwith chlorite. Discrete albitization and turmalinization and discrete to pronounced sulfidization \n\nand silicification are observed here.  \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 11 \u2013 Main hydrothermal alteration rocks of the Lamego Deposit. \n\n3.4 - Mineralization \n\nThe orebodies comprise both BIFs and gray quartz veins and are characterized by \n\nsulfidization either in bands, disseminated or as fracture fillings. The plunge of the ore shoots \n\ncoincides with the mineral stretching lineation.  \n\nThe sulfidized bodies hosted by BIF at Lamego correspond to type 2 as defined by Vial \n\n(2007) and are composed of pyrite, and subordinately pyrrhotite and arsenopirite. The sulfides fill \n\nfractures together with quartz, and replace carbonate-rich bands in the BIF either symmetrically \n\nor asymmetrically to the fracture. \n\nIn contrast to the Cuiaba deposit, the gray quartz veins at Lamego form a stratabound \n\nhorizon that is usually in contact with the BIF layer. These masses of gray quartz can show an \n\nirregular shape, boudinated or not, discordant to the bedding, which provides further evidence of \n\nits hydrothermal, structurally-controlled origin. The greater resistance of the quartz veins to \n\ndeformation is responsible for its differential shearing, which creates conditions for the \n\naccumulation of sulfides and native (free) microscopic gold in fractures. Secondarily, gold is \n\nfound included in pyrite grains. These gray quartz veins show the \u201cjaguar hide\u201d texture - a feature \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\nattributed to the high content of fluid inclusions. In some places there are decimetric to metric \n\nportions of BIF \u2018floating\u2019 in the quartz vein, suggesting that the original BIF has been consumed \n\nby the silica-rich hydrothermal fluid.  \n\nThe mineralization controls appear to have a very strong structural component, being \n\nassociated with shear zones, folds, or host-rock replacements along bedding, fractures, foliations \n\nor shear zones. The orebodies were substantially deformed, and occasionally the hosting \n\ncarbonaceous schists and nearby quartz veins can contain gold. The gold distribution is very \n\nirregular, with the orebodies showing great variation in thickness and grade, both along strike and \n\nplunge directions. The delineation of these orebodies (mining areas) is performed chiefly by \n\nchemical determination. \n\nThe gold at Lamego forms an alloy with silver, with a gold-to-silver ratio of 7:1 (Ribeiro-\n\nRodrigues 1998), either as xenomorphic grains or as fillets, along fractures in sulfide grains. Gold \n\nassociated with pyrrhotite is the coarsest particle (i.e., 50\u00b5m to 120\u00b5m in size), usually occurring \n\nalong the margins of the grains. Gold associated with pyrite is 10\u00b5m to 50\u00b5m in size, and occurs \n\nessentially as inclusions. Gold associated with arsenopyrite (as inclusions) and gangue (inclusions \n\nor at the interface of the grains) is typically less than 10\u00b5m in size (Vieira 1991). \n\n3.5 - Orebodies \n\n Carruagem Oreboby \n\nThe Carruagem orebody is located at the junction zone of the two flanks in the NE portion \n\nof the major structure. At the first level, it is a boudinaged orebody with two large disruptions of \n\nthe structure, which are followed by eastward displacement. The structures trend 34\no\nNE along the \n\nstrike, and the plunge is approximately 95\no\n/22\n\no\n (Figure 12). \n\nThe mineralization is not directly associated with sulfidation, given that native (free) gold \n\nis frequently found in samples extracted from sampling channels and boreholes. Stratabound gray \n\nquartz veins are the dominant host to the gold. No key reef horizon has been identified for the \n\nmineralization, which occurs in a disseminate manner and therefore renders difficulties for the \n\nconduction of a representative channel-sampling campaign. \n\n \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 12 \u2013 Geological map of the Carruagem orebody and the mineralized area \u2013 Levels 1 and 2.  \n\n \n\nDisruptions are also observed in level 2, including major displacements of more than \n\n30m. Level 2 comprises portions of BIF within gray quartz masses and vice versa (Figure 13). \n\nDifferently than observed at level 1, the two mineralized limbs at level 2 are not evident. This is \n\nbecause the metandesite positioned between the limbs is highly altered (X2 and X2Cl) and \n\ndisrupted, making the interpretation difficult. \n\nHigh sulfidization portions are usually found in the Carraugem orebody, mainly \n\nassociated with gray quartz masses (Figure 14). \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 13 \u2013 Islands of BIF preserved with high sulfidation within a gray quartz mass - Carruagem orebody. \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 14 \u2013 Drillcore sample with aggregates of pyrites within gray quartz mass.  \n\n  \n\n Cabe\u00e7a de Pedra Orebody \n\nThe Cabe\u00e7a de Pedra orebody is located in the hinge region of the large Lamego structure. \n\nThe area that shows economic feasibility contains 70% of BIFs and 30% of gray quartz veins. \n\nThe presence of faulting makes stratigraphy difficult to follow in certain places (Figure 15). \n\nUsually, XG and metapelites (X1) occur in the hanging wall contact, and meta-andesites in the \n\nfootwall. The average plunge measured for this orebody is 125\u00ba/25\u00ba. \n\nThe development in this orebody is concentrated in the excavations of the ramp to reach \n\nlevel 2. \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 15 \u2013 Geological map of the Cabe\u00e7a de Pedra orebody and mineralized area \u2013 Level 01 \n\n  \n\n Arco da Velha Orebody \n\nThe Arco da Velha orebody is located in the normal, eastern flank of the large fold. It \n\nextends approximately 250m (level 01) along the strike. In the northeastern portion of the \n\norebody, the mineralization is concentrated in the gray quartz veins, whereas in the southeastern \n\nportion it is concentrated in the BIF. XG and X1 occur in the hanging wall contact, whereas the \n\nhydrothermal alteration zone marked by the metandesite (MANX) occurs in the footwall (Figure \n\n16). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 16 \u2013 Geological map of the Arco da Velha orebody \u2013 Levels 1 and 2. Mineralized domains \n\nare highlighted in red. \n\n \n\nThe BIF and gray quartz masses structure are very thick, but the mineralization does not \n\noccur in the entire structure. This situation poses some difficulties to the development and mining \n\nalong the orebody, since there are no geologic guides such as lithological contacts to be followed. \n\nThere is no preferred horizon for the enrichment \u2013 the mineralization occurs near to the footwall \n\ncontact, in the hanging wall contact and in the center of the structure. \n\nUsually, the mineralized portions are also rich in pyrite, although the occurrence of high \n\npercentages of pyrite with low gold grades, or no gold at all, is common. In order to minimize \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\nerrors and optimize the development, horizontal drilling campaigns are conducted at the level of \n\nthe development, thus making it possible to predict the behavior of the mineralization along the \n\nstrike. \n\nAt level 01, only two barren spots interrupting the mineralized structure were mapped. At \n\nlevel 02, however, the number of barren gaps between mineralized portions is significantly larger, \n\nwith parallel structures occurring at close distance from each other, which makes them more \n\ndifficult to mine because of rock stability problems. \n\nThe structures usually strike NE-SW with an average plunge of 105\u00ba/25\u00ba. \n\n Queimada Orebody \n\nThis orebody is located in the inverted or western flank of the large fold. At level 1, only \n\n90m of the mineralized zone (considering a total of 250m along the strike) showed economic \n\nfeasibility. BIFs are dominant, with mineralized gray quartz veins occurring mainly in the \n\nfootwall contacts of the structure. In contrast to what is observed in the normal flank (Arco da \n\nVelha orebody), the hydrothermal alteration zone (metandesites, X2 and X2Cl) occurs in the \n\nhanging wall contact, whereas the metapelites and XG are detected in the footwall (Figure 17). \n\nThe average plunge of this orebody is 102\u00ba/29\u00ba.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 17 \u2013 Geological map of the Queimada orebody: levels 1 and 2 and intermediate level.  \n\n \n\nIn addition to level 1, two other levels are exposed, namely: , the intermediate level (12m \n\nbelow level 1) and level 2 (50m below level 1). \n\nThe NE portion of the structure is characterized by thin BIF layers, which makes it \n\npossible to observe the FW (XG e X1) and the HW (MAN) contacts. There are interruptions in \n\nthe structure at the contact of XG with MAN. In this portion, the intermediate level, which is \n\ncomposed of extremely sulfidized BIFs (mainly pyrite and arsenopyrite), shows high gold grades. \n\nThe SW sector is characterized by a thicker BIF and therefore the underground \n\ndevelopment does not always expose the HW and FW contacts. Although the structure here is \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\nmore continuous, gold grades are lower. Level 2 showed a negative result for the mining activity \n\nbecause the mineralized portions were very small and with grades lower than expected. \n\n \n\n4 \u2013 METHODOLOGICAL BACKGROUND   \n\nIn this chapter, the employed methods are presented as follows: (i) firstly, details are given \n\nabout the airborne geophysical survey and pre-processing and processing procedures applied to \n\nthe data; (ii) secondly, background work on geophysical inversion processes and the application \n\nof inversion algorithms to the EM data are presented; (iii) thirdly, the applied ground IP \n\ntechnology, including program, methods, arrangement and interpolation, beyond inversion of the \n\nresistivity and chargeability themes, are described; (iv) fourthly, multi-thematic fuzzy-Boolean \n\nmodels are explained as to assist in integration of multi-source data. This last method was applied \n\nonly for the Morro da Gl\u00f3ria deposit. \n\nThe final results obtained on the basis of each applied methodology are presented in the \n\nfollowing sections, combined with the geological and geochemical results individually for each \n\ndeposit and satellite target. \n\n4.1 \u2013 Airborne Geophysics \u2013 SPECTREM \n\nIn 1982, the Anglo American Corporation (AAC) hired the A-Cubed firm from Toronto, \n\nCanada, to built a new wideband, digital, towed bird AEM system called PROSPECT 1 (Annan, \n\n1986). In 1988, the development of the system was taken over by AAC. After extensive \n\nmodifications, the prototype system became operational in 1989, when it was coined \n\nSPECTREM. In 1990, a new research and development program started and all the electronic \n\nhardware and software were replaced in the system. At the completion of the program in 1993, \n\nnoise levels were reduced by a factor of 5 compared to the original prototype system. Since 1993, \n\nfurther upgrades have been made to increase the reliability of the system and further reduced its \n\nnoise levels (Klinkert et al., 1997). \n\nThe SPECTREM system has a time domain STEP response that was chosen because of its \n\nwide bandwidth and better geological noise rejection in the search for highly conductive massive \n\nsulphide bodies. At 90Hz base frequency, SPECTREM\u2019s bandwidths cover delay times with \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\nwindow centers from 22 to 4156 microseconds versus the 220 to 3300 microseconds off time \n\nwindow centers of the PULSE system. The SPECTREM delay times result in a better shallow \n\nsounding capability (Klinkert et al., 1997). \n\n \n\nProcessing of airborne data \u2013 SPECTREM  \n\nIn this study, in addition to processing the geochemical and geological information used in \n\nthree-dimensional modeling of the gold-bearing mineralization in the Lamego, digital data were \n\nalso used from an aerial geophysical survey by AngloGold Ashanti Brasil Minera\u00e7\u00e3o Ltda called \n\n\"Spectrem Airborne Electromagnetic Survey-2002\". Electromagnetic (EM) data only was used \n\nhere, particularly for identifying regions with advanced sulphitization processes and, \n\nconsequently, with gold-bearing potential. \n\nSome of the most important pre-processing of the EM data is conducted directly on the \n\naircraft during the data acquisition. The data are subjected to a de-convolution to remove \n\nunwanted signals and converted to square waves. The next step in processing is to separate the \n\nsignals into 8 channels or windows. As the SPECTREM system initiates measurements to \n\nconnect the transmitter, it is necessary to separate the primary field (transmitted) from the \n\nsecondary field (induced). The last channel measures only the primary field. So, it can be \n\nsubtracted from the other channels to separate the secondary electromagnetic field, finally \n\nresulting in 7 channels from which geological information can be extracted (Spectrem Aerial \n\nSurvey 2002). \n\nThe spikes in the lines were removed using Naudy-type three-point filters. Decorrugation \n\nfilters were applied to reduce the \u201cfishbone\u201d effects created by geometric anisotropy inherent to \n\nthe aerial electromagnetic system. Micro-leveling processes were applied in all 7 EM channels to \n\nreduce small residual errors, which were not effectively subtracted in the drift corrections made \n\ndirectly on the aircraft.  \n\nAnomalies in the magnetic and electromagnetic data caused by anthropogenic influences, \n\n(e.g., power transmission lines at various magnitudes, near electrical transformers, and aerial \n\nropeways used to transport gold ore to the processing stations), were removed or smoothed out. \n\nFigure 18 briefly illustrates the main characteristics of the airborne geophysical survey. \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 18 \u2013 Details of the airborne geophysical survey. Spectrem Airborne Electromagnetic Survey-\n\n2002 by AngloGold Ashanti Brasil Minera\u00e7\u00e3o Ltda. \n\n \n\n4.2 \u2013 Geophysical Inversion - Background \n\nGeophysical inversion processes have been applied to various mineral deposits over the \n\nlast several years with the objective of (i) estimating the depth of the magnetic or conductive \n\nbodies, or bodies with distinct physical properties;  (ii)  better defining the lateral and longitudinal \n\nrange limits of mineralized areas; and, (iii)  assisting in exploration, mainly with base metals, \n\ngold and iron. \n\nLi &amp; Oldenburg (2003) discuss the historical development of the inversion process \n\nthrough their Logarithmic Barrier method using conjugated gradients. Phillips et al. (2001) \n\napplied geophysical inversion processes to a volcanogenic massive sulphide deposit of copper-\n\nzinc in San Nicolas, Mexico. These authors showed that by inverting terrestrial magnetometry, \n\ninduced polarization (IP) and gravimetric data, they were able to successfully characterize the \n\ngeometry of the main mineralized bodies. \n\nSilva et al. (2001) demonstrated the importance of using reference models defining the \n\nconstraints limits in the inversion processes. These limits can be, for example, known three \n\ndimensional lithological areas which have physical characteristics that are compatible with the \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\ngeophysical method applied.  These limits assist in filtering out non-uniqueness from the \n\nsolutions provided by the inversion process. \n\nDentith (2003) published a set of geophysical signatures of Australian mineral deposits, \n\nwhich represented a milestone in Australian geophysics at the beginning of the decade.  Of the 21 \n\ncase histories presented, nine used geophysical inversion and produced significant results. \n\nOldenburg &amp; Pratt (2007) contributed to a complete analysis of the application of the \n\ngeophysical inversion process, characterizing in theory and in practice, details for inversion \n\nprocedures in mineral exploration. According to the authors, the last decade was marked with \n\nmajor advances in the process of the inversion of various types of geophysical data.  Advances \n\nhave been promoted mainly by the development optimization mathematics, visualization and \n\ncomputational power.  \n\nIn addressing of the inversion problem applied to mineral exploration, Oldenburg &amp; Pratt \n\n(2007) created three large categories: Type I: Discrete Body Inversion; Type II: Pure Property \n\nInversion; and, Type III:  Lithologic Inversion. \n\nType I: Discrete Body Inversion \n\nThe inversion problem is formulated to find a relatively small number of homogeneous \n\nbodies which may not completely fill a 3D volume.  The physical property, size or form of the \n\nbody can also be evaluated. The bodies can be simple volumetric plates, ellipsoids or complex \n\ngeological forms that can be parametrically described. \n\nSimple parameterization or multiple bodies are used to model discrete changes in the \n\nproperties of underground rocks.  Each surface includes a volume of rock which has uniform \n\nphysical properties. Examples of forms that can be adequately modeled are illustrated in Figure \n\n19. \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 19: Example of discrete surfaces enclosing volumes of uniform physical properties. \n\nShapes include an extruded map polygon, an extruded polygonal section, an ellipse, a sphere, a \n\nfrustum, and a tabular body. Discrete bodies can be combined to construct complex geologic \n\nmodels (Oldenburg &amp; Pratt, 2007). \n\n \n\nIn Figure 19, the sphere, the ellipse and the tabular body all have simple analytical \n\nexpressions and can be easily parameterized. The solids with polygonal sections can be \n\nmanipulated in a map view or section. \n\n The advantages which result from the use of the parameterization method include:  (i)  \n\nspeed of the inversion process;  (ii) focus on target anomalies;  (iii)  pre-prepared \n\nparameterizations for some known forms; (iv) Easy representation of geological limits; (v) covers \n\nthe properties of most volumetric solids;  (vi)  estimation of the depth of the top of the anomaly; \n\n(vii) estimation of the three dimensional position of geological bodies; (viii) possibility of more \n\nrefined details of the geological limits. \n\nResearch that uses the Type I inversion process has been focused on locating body \n\nextensions with simple forms, with the aim of emulating the problems of complex geological \n\nmodels, which assists in more detailed investigations of mineral deposits.(Pratt, Foss e Roberts, \n\n2006).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\nType II: Pure Property Inversion \n\n The objective of this inversion is to find a function which characterizes the distribution of \n\nthe physical property.  As a generic example, one can obtain an appropriate model \u201cm\u201d by \n\nminimizing the objective function: \n\n \nIn equation (1) from de Oldenburg &amp; Pratt (2007), the mref is a reference or initial model \n\nof the inversion process. The coefficients ? control the relative importance of smoothing in \n\nvarious directions, comparing to the approximation of the background, and w(s) are functions of \n\nweight. All these parameters must be specified for the inversion process and the complexity is a \n\nfunction of what is known about the model. For example, in a greenfield area, the reference \n\nmodel can be a uniform volume, while in an area where there is a known deposit (brownfield), \n\nthe reference model can have a more complex structure with various sizes and shapes. The \n\nfunctions of weight can also be used to help honor the prior information in various positions in \n\nthe model.  \n\nAdditional information about Type II inversions can be found in Oldenburg &amp; Pratt \n\n(2007). \n\nType III: Lithological Inversion \n\nIn this case, the inversion problem is formulated in a geological area and the relationship \n\nbetween the rock units and physical properties must be well understood.  Each cell in the model \n\nhas one particular type of rock related to it. The cells are completely filled with volumes. One cell \n\ncan have a small rectangular unit (as used in the problem applicable to Type II), a discrete large \n\nbody (as in the Type I example), or a combination of the two. The difference is that the \n\nparameters can be associated with the location of the boundaries and/or the rock type. \n\nThe classifications above are mainly to be understood as a structure, and secondly as a \n\nway to categorize different inversion algorithms.  Many existing algorithms can be executed in \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nmore than one category.  For example, the VPmg algorithm (Fullagar 2004) can change the \n\nlocation of an interface or can find a smooth distribution of the properties of a defined geological \n\nunit.  Therefore, it has elements that can be characterized as both Type I and Type II and \n\ndepending on its implementation, can be considered as a Type III inversion.  Similarly, the \n\nexistence of a reference model allow the inversion of UBC-GIF operating in Type II or Type III \n\nmode.  ModelVision (Pratt et al. 2007) can also be thought of as a hybrid model which \n\nincorporates methodological aspects of Type I and Type III together.  Other formulations, such as \n\nthe geostatistical inversion of GeoModeller (Guillen et al. 2004) and the stylized inversions of \n\nQuickMag (Pratt et al. 2001) are more directly categorized as Type III inversions.   \n\nThe important thing is that all types share a similar objective of trying to extract a \n\ncoherent geological interpretation from geophysical data. The adopted procedure, more than \n\nanything, depends on the limits of the area, the scale of the geological information, precision, \n\nrelative cost, processing time and interactivity.  Processing time is not proportionate to the \n\nnumber of parameters and can vary from seconds to days (Oldenburg &amp; Pratt, 2007). \n\nGeophysical inversion is normally applied along parallel line sections of the survey to \n\nestimate the depth of the conductive mass in the respective section.  However, the inversion can \n\nalso be done in three dimensions, where the spacing between the sections is close enough, in a \n\nsituation where three dimensional interpolations are permissible. The product of this process is \n\ndefined by a model of matrix blocks, which makes an integrated visualization with other three \n\ndimensional information possible.  This facilitates the process of understanding the geology of the \n\nstudy area and as a consequence, contributing to better one\u2019s economic resources. \n\n4.3 \u2013 Ground Geophysics Survey - Induced Polarization and Resistivity \n\nBasic Concepts \n\nInduced polarization (IP) was used in the past mainly in the exploration of base metals \n\nand, to a lesser extent, the search for groundwater. Although the Schlumberger brothers, pioneers \n\nin exploration geophysics, have recognized the phenomenon of induced polarization for at least \n\n60 years ago, its popularity as an exploratory tool came to light only in the mid 1950s (Telford et \n\nal., 1990). \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\nAn illustration of induced polarization can be obtained by a pattern of four electrodes in a \n\nscattering of DC resistivity, by an abrupt cessation of the current. The voltage crosses the \n\npotential electrodes and generally is not remitted to zero instantaneously, but is reduced relatively \n\nslowly after a large initial decrease in the original fixed value. If the current is turned on again, \n\nthe potential, after a sudden initial increase, builds up over a time interval similar to the original \n\namplitude (Telford et al., 1990). Figure 20 shows the sources of the induced polarization effects \n\nin comparison of the decay curves and RC circuit. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 20 \u2013 Comparison of the decay curves and RC circuit (Telford et al., 1990). \n\n \n\nIn one type of IP detector, the decay voltage is measured as a function of time in various \n\nways. This method is known as IP in the time domain. Because the accumulation time is also \n\nfinite, it does not interfere with the apparent resistivity (complex impedance) and should vary \n\nwith the frequency, decreasing as the latter increases. Thus, the measure of ?a from two or more \n\nfrequencies, usually below 10 Hz, is another detection method. The latter is known as the IP in \n\nthe frequency domain. Figure 21 shows different measurements of the IP effect in the time \n\ndomain: (a) Comparison between V(t) and Vc; (b) V(t) integral in a time interval (Telford et al. \n\n1990). \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 21 - Different measurements of the IP effect in the time domain. (a) Comparison between \n\nV (t) and Vc; (b) V (t) integral in a time interval (Telford et al. 1990).  \n\n \n\nThe chargeability effect can be established by: \n\n             t2 \n        M = 1/Vc ? V(t) dt       [1]              \n\n            t1 \nand is most commonly used to measure the IP effect in the time domain. When V(t) and Vc have \n\nthe same unit, chargeability is measured in milliseconds. \n\n Although types and levels of mineralization do not yet have fixed IP value response, \n\ntables prepared by Telford et al. (1990) were made through the empirical evaluation of field \n\nresults. Table 1 lists chargeability values of a set of minerals in a concentration of up to 1% of the \n\ntotal sample. The duration of the current of the square-wave was 3s and decay was integrated over \n\n1s. These figures seem to be somewhat high as compared to regular field measurements, since no \n\ncurrents are used with very long time cycles or such a long integration of the full-time decay \n\ncurve. \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Chargeability of some minerals, Telford et al. (1990). \n\n \n \n\nTable 2 shows responses of various types of rocks, mineralized or not. In this situation, \n\nthe charge time was long (~1min) and the decay curve was integrated throughout its duration \n\n(except for the initial transient and final noise). \n\n \n\nTable 2 \u2013 Chargeability of some rocks, Telford et al. (1990). \n\n \n\nOne of the first applications of 2D inversion in mineral exploration was in the Century \n\nzinc deposit, in Australia (Mutton 1997). There the mineralization occurs preferentially \n\nassociated with a carbonaceous schist unit with fine grains of sphalerite and galena and, \n\nsecondarily, pyrite. A pseudo-section of apparent resistivity is shown in Figure 22. Before using \n\nthe inversion process, the standard method for interpreting these data was to make inferences \n\nusing pseudo-section compilations. Each sample, however, represents an overall average of the \n\nconductivity and the volume of sensitivity is dependent on the positions of current and receiver \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\nelectrodes. Only under rare circumstances did the image or presentation of the data approximate \n\nthe geology. \n\n \nFigure 22 - Pseudo-sections of resistivity and IP are shown in (a) and (b), respectively. Inverted \n\nsections of conductivity and chargeability are shown in (c) and (d), respectively (Mutton 1997, \n\nquoted in Oldenburg &amp; Pratt 2007). \n\n \n\n5 \u2013 GEOPHYSICAL RESULTS AT LAMEGO DEPOSIT AND S\u00c3O JOS\u00c9 TARGET \n\nThe results presented in this section comprises an integration of geophysical, geological \n\nand geochemical information from the Lamego deposit and S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 target. Results for others \n\ntargets (Biquinha, Sobradinho, Bom Caminho and Morro da Gl\u00f3ria) are also presented \n\nindividually in the subsequent sections. \n\n5.1 \u2013 Electromagnetic Results of Lamego Deposit  \n\nThe electromagnetic results obtained by the Spectrem survey in the region of the Lamego \n\ndeposit highlight a major anomaly in the Tauz Channel in a peripheral area with dimensions that \n\napproximate the dimensions of the mega-structure of the deposit. This anomaly has, at the surface, \n\ndisplacement in the direction of the dip of the main ore bodies. As the Tauz Channel has \n\ninvestigation characteristics at depths greater than 150m, the anomaly allowed the visualization of \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\nthe continuity in depth of the electromagnetic conductive bodies, which, in this case, are represented \n\nby bodies with prominent sulphidation along with an envelope of carbonaceous schist, which \n\ntogether accentuate the intensity of the anomaly (Figures 23A and 23B). \n\n \nFigure 23 \u2013 (A) Digital elevation model integrated with the geological surface map. (B) EM \n\nanomalies (Tauz Channel) integrated with geological surface map (translucence). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\n5.2 \u2013 Geophysical Inversion of Electromagnetic Data  \n\nThe geophysical inversion of the electromagnetic data in this study was performed only \n\nfor the Tauz Channel because it is one of the channels responsible for investigations into the \n\ndeeper levels and showed better correlations to the projections of the known sulphide orebodies \n\n(Figure 24). \n\nThe inversion performed on the electromagnetic conductivity data was processed for the \n\nentire survey and did not consider the information on the volumes of three-dimensionally \n\nmodeled solids. Therefore, this approach differs from the Type I inversion (inversion of discrete \n\nbodies) from Pratt &amp; Oldenburg (2007), since no form or known combination of geometric \n\nshapes was considered as a reference model during the inversion process. \n\nThis study used a three dimensional block diagram as a reference model. The upper face of \n\nthe model matches the surface topography and was properly shifted down to a depth of 150m. \n\nParameterization exercises, varying the functions of weights and the variables that control the \n\nsmoothing in various directions, were performed throughout the entire survey in order to obtain a \n\ndirect inverted model. In this case, the electromagnetic conductors correlated vertically with the \n\nmain gold-bearing deposits in regions such as Cuiab\u00e1, Lamego and other smaller deposits such as \n\nMorro da Gl\u00f3ria. \n\nFigure 24 shows the result of the inversion of the electromagnetic Tauz Channel, together \n\nwith the three-dimensional geological models generated from the results of drill core samples. \n\nThe geological modeling was limited to samples with gold grades above 2.5g/t and a real \n\nthickness of more than 1.6m. On the product of the inversion process showed on Figure 24, the \n\nselected blocks corresponds to electromagnetic conductivity higher than 250 mS/m.  \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 24 \u2013 3D geological models with inverted electromagnetic raster block model (Tauz \n\nChannel). \n\nThe result of direct three-dimensional inversion in the Lamego region presented some \n\nsignificant responses from the exploratory viewpoint and the inversion process itself: \n\n(i) at shallow depths (up to 150m), the correlation between the known sulphide bodies and the \n\ninverted EM model is not well adjusted at higher structural levels when compared to deeper levels; \n\nthis can be recognized in nearly all the bodies; (ii) at deeper levels, electromagnetic anomalies have \n\ncontinuities relatively parallel to the direction of the plunges and dips, largely in the sulphid-richer \n\nbodies: Carruagem and Cabe\u00e7a de Pedra; (iii) an anomaly in the SW region of the Cabe\u00e7a de Pedra \n\nbody was recognized, demonstrating a potential for future investigations, and (iv) the presence of \n\nadditional anomalies in the SW continuity of the Carruagem body also shows considerable \n\nexploration potential in this region. \n\n5.3 \u2013 IP Survey of the Lamego Deposit and the S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 Target and Drilling Results \n\nThe four parallel IP sections carried out longitudinally to the Lamego deposit and its \n\npossible continuation to the northeast (S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 target) were spaced 200m apart. Thus, the \n\nestimated depth of the anomalies, or of the modeled bodies, was approximately 100m, 200m, and \n\n300m for the IP1, 2, and 3, respectively (Figure 25) representing individual investigation depths. \n\nThe purpose of this configuration was (i) to evaluate the characteristics of the IP signatures and \n\nresistivity of the known modeled bodies, (ii) to find other potential bodies not reached by \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\nprevious shallow drillings, and (iii) to recognize possible lateral extensions of sulphide horizons \n\nnot previously modeled or drilled. \n\n \nFigure 25 \u2013 Left: simplified geologic map of the Lamego deposit and location of IP sections \n\nsurveyed southeast of the deposit and southeast of the S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 target.  An Ikonos true color \n\ncomposite imagery in the background. Right, vertical sections with projections of the mineralized \n\nbodies of the Lamego deposit. In each associated depth (Serie 100 refers to 100m depth, Serie \n\n200 refers to 200m depth and Serie 300, 300m depth).   \n\n \n\nFour IP lines were studied. Lines 1, 2, and 3 were surveyed with a = 100m, and line 4 with \n\na = 50m (\u201ca\u201d is the spacing between the receivers). Six depth levels were recorded for all lines \n\nwith 2-seconds integration time (Figure 26). In the  resistivity and induced polarization study, a \n\ndipole-dipole configuration was used, making it necessary to inject a current I (amperes) to the \n\nunderground by means of a dipole current, recording a drop in the V potential (in milliVolts) in \n\nanother dipole far from the first one (potential dipole). \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 26 - Schematic arrangement of the IP4 section - S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 Target, oriented SW-NE (\u201ca\" is \n\nthe spacing between the receivers and \u201cn\u201d are the samples with the positioning of the depth of the \n\nreadings of the signal). \n\n  \n\nThe resistivity of the medium is proportional to the ratio between the voltage and current \n\n(V/I). This procedure makes it possible to take simultaneous measurements with up to six values \n\nof potential drop for each current dipole. \n\nIn the time domain, the IP effect (chargeability [mV/V]) manifests itself as a transient \n\nvoltage when the excitation current is abruptly cut off. This temporal decay curve is sampled at a \n\nseries of moments to determine the chargeability (IP effect), which corresponds to the area below \n\nthe transient curve. \n\nThe inversion models of resistivity and chargeability (voltage decay) were obtained by \n\nusing the ResCalc and IP_Avg variables, respectively. The models were obtained without any \n\npreference for dip, that is to say, no horizontal or vertical preference was given to the polarized \n\nbodies (Type II inversion from Oldenburg &amp; Pratt, 2007). \n\nThe pseudo-sections of resistivity and chargeability were interpreted with  the RESIX \n\nIP2DI software, especially using the Zong Smooth Model Algorithm, best known by ZONGE 2D \n\n(cf. http://www.interpex.com/). The applied algorithm is based on the finite element method in \n\ntwo dimensions, which incorporates the topography to the modeling of the Resistivity and IP \n\ndata.  \n\nStarting with the grids of the inverted models of resistivity and IP, sections and vertical \n\nhalf-derivative (0.5dv) maps were calculated. These end products highlight the changes in both \n\nthe resistivity and IP and also enable the anomalies to be properly established. \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\nAfter completing all processing steps, the three-dimensional geometric sections must be \n\ncorrected so that the data are formatted in a single space platform. \n\nIn the region of the Lamego deposit, a sub-horizontal surface layer was detected with a \n\nthickness between 80 and 100m and values far below 12mV/V. Under this surface layer, devoid \n\nof IP effects, anomalous values greater than 15mV/V were recorded, significantly correlated with \n\nthe sulfide ore bodies (Figure 27). \n\nFigure 28 shows the results of the inversion of the resistivity property at IP1, together with \n\nsurface geological and geochemical information (S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 Target), in addition to three-\n\ndimensional geological models of the Lamego deposit ore bodies. It is noted that the Carruagem \n\norebodies, in which there is a predominance of highly resistive quartz veins, shows a good \n\ncorrelation to deeper resistivity anomalies and a lateral continuity. The Arco da Velha and \n\nQueimada bodies are the only ones that form a mirroring between the two sides, that is to say, a \n\nsub-vertical drill hole positioned to reach the Arco da Velha body should intercept, in depth, the \n\nmineralized horizon of the inverted side (Queimada orebody) of the mega-structure. The \n\nduplication of the resistivity effect occurs in this position, in which the fault moves to depths \n\ngreater than 300m. The Arco da Velha orebody was also marked by the resistivity model, which \n\nrecognized the gray quartz vein stratabound packages at up to a thickness of 30m. In the Cabe\u00e7a \n\nde Pedra orebody, which also contains decametric stratabound packages of gray quartz veins, the \n\nresistivity effect was mitigated due to the thick envelope of carbonaceous schist in its hanging \n\nwall. \n\nIP anomalies (chargeability) from the IP1 section (Figure 29) show an excellent \n\ncorrelation with the ore bodies modeled in Carruagem, which, although not presenting a \n\nsignificant correlation between gold levels and sulfide content, could still locally contain \n\nreasonable amounts of pyrite, either in gray quartz vein or BIF. Also evident is the continuity of \n\nthe IP anomaly to the northeast of the main structure, interpreted as being marked by bundles of \n\nintensely sulfide carbonaceous schists, although virtually gold free. On the other hand, in the \n\nresistivity section (Figure 28), the anomaly is interrupted to the northeast, demonstrating the \n\ntermination of this northern ore body. \n\nThe chargeability anomaly from the IP1 section satisfactorily marks the sulfide domains. \n\nThis was observed almost continuously from the southernmost edge of the Cabe\u00e7a de Pedra \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\norebody to the northeastern edge of the Arco da Velha orebody. This anomaly is also supported \n\nby geochemical measurements of sulphur content obtained from borehole samples. However, the \n\ngold-bearing mineralization is shown to be discontinuous between the two bodies. \n\n The chargeability anomalies from the subsequent IP sections (IP2 and IP3) produced for \n\nthe Carruagem orebody display a continuity that is consistent with the direction and known dip of \n\nthat body. The same was not verified for the Arco da Velha and Cabe\u00e7a de Pedra orebodies \n\n(Figure 30). This lack of correlation is mainly due to the lack of coincidence between these \n\norebodies and large gold-bearing sulfide masses, as discussed by Guimaraes et al. (2008). \n\n \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 27 \u2013 Inverted SW-NE section - IP1 - Chargeability with low values layer between 80 to 100m deep range. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 28 - SW-NE-IP1 section \u2013 Resistivity values, with surface geological and geochemical information and three-dimensional \n\ngeological models of Lamego deposit with gold orebodies.

A recent \n\nsurvey (red drill holes) intercepted a secondary anomaly with positive results for sulfide and gold. \n\nFigure 31B shows a good match between richer ore zones and resistivity anomalies at the S\u00e3o \n\nJos\u00e9 target.  \n\n \nFigure 31 \u2013 Geophysical sections with drillings (in red and circled) carried out to test resistivity \n\nanomalies in the Carruagem orebody (upper figure) and in the S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 target (lower figure). \n\n \n\nAll the information used here in gold prospectivity was visualized and integrated in a 3D \n\nGIS platform (Figure 32). The anomalous EM blocks (90th percentile) indicate that Cabe\u00e7a de \n\nPedra and Arco da Velha orebodies show continuity in depth (down plunge) along a slightly \n\ndifferent direction from the actual plunge measured underground. In fact, these anomalies outline, \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\nwith significant quality, the shallower levels of sulphidization in these two mineralized areas. \n\nExtensive sulphide-rich packages of carbonaceous schist that envelop the Cabe\u00e7a de Pedra \n\norebody may also be responsible for these different directions of the actual mineralized plunge. \n\n \nFigure 32 \u2013 Three-dimensional integration of the 3D voxel model (Inverted EM \u2013 percentile 90 - \n\nred blocks) with IP section (1/2 derivative) in the Lamego deposit and S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 Target. \n\n \n\n6 \u2013 SATELLITE TARGES  \n\nBased on results obtained on Lamego deposit, similar studies were developed for more \n\nfour satellite areas: Biquinha, Sobradinho and Bom Caminho targets corresponding to the same \n\nstratigraphic level of Lamego deposit; and Morro da Gl\u00f3ria positioned western of Quadril\u00e1tero \n\nFerr\u00edfero.   \n\n6.1 \u2013 BIQUINHA TARGET \n\n The Biquinha target is located 900 m northeast of the open pit of the Cuiab\u00e1 mine (Figure \n\n3). It includes a series of old excavations oriented in S80\u00b0E and N20\u00b0E directions (Figure 33). \n\nOutcrops are scarce and seven boreholes were interpreted to reveal geologic aspects of the area. \n\nRocks that commonly bear gold mineralization as observed in Lamego (gray quartz vein \n\nand BIF) or Cuiab\u00e1 (BIF) were not intercepted in the drill holes, thus hindering the establishment \n\nof a stratigraphy for the target. The predominant intercepted rock is a light gray, fine-to-medium \n\ngrained, metavolcaniclastic rock, with incipient to moderate foliation. There are, to a lesser \n\nextent, metric intercalations of dark, gray metapelitic rocks and, more rarely, black carbonaceous \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\nschist with intervals rich in fine to medium grained pyrite crystals. Quartz veins are abundant, \n\neither milky white or gray in color, with a decimetric to metric thickness.  \n\n \n\nIP Results from the Biquinha Target \n\n The IP sections in the Biquinha target are spaced of 100 m, thus allowing for more \n\ndetailed information. Figure 33 shows a grid of soil samples with gold anomalies, old excavations \n\nand the 3 IP lines considered in this work.   \n\n \n\n \nFigure 33 \u2013 Biquinha target, which is located in the vicinity of the Cuiab\u00e1 mine. Gold anomalies \n\nin soils samples (higher anomalies in red), old excavations (in ciano) and position of IP sections.  \n\n \n\nThe chargeability anomalies mapped with the IP sections show a good spatial correlation \n\nwith the main soil anomalies. New potential prospects were also revealed. The SW chargeability \n\nanomaly (IP1 \u2013 Figure 34) is represented at surface by materials of anthropogenic origin, such as \n\nwater pipes and masonry buildings. However, the anomalies registered in the subsequent sections \n\n(IP2 and IP3) suggest a straight association with the orebody and its continuity down plunge.  \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 34 \u2013 Biquinha target: three-dimensional integration of the IP sections with soil \n\ngeochemical data and surface excavations.   \n \n\nBorehole samples of the Biquinha target were analyzed for gold but no geochemical \n\nanomalies were discovered to date. Nevertheless, prominent sulphidization, dominated by pyrite, \n\nmay reach up to 5% of the sample, showing coherence with the mapped IP anomalies. \n\n \n\n6.2 \u2013 SOBRADINHO TARGET \n\nThe Sobradinho target is located 7 km northwest of Raposos and it is near the Lamego \n\nopen pit mine (Figure 3). The area comprises rocks of the Nova Lima Group, including mafic and \n\nintermediate metavolcanic rocks interlayered with metapelitic beds; metric levels of carbonaceous \n\nschist, and a horizon of BIF (Figure 35). The configuration of this lithological set is not \n\nsufficiently understood, although available field data and drillings have established that the rock \n\npackage is folded.  \n\n \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 35 \u2013 Vertical N30E geological section of the Sobradinho target, interpreted using \n\nexploration drill holes. \n \n\nMacroscopically, the metapelitic rocks display millimetric banding conferred by \n\nalternating bands of quartz-carbonate with micaceous beds and quartz-carbonate aggregates. \n\nOccasionally, euhedral and subeuhedral pyrite crystals occur in a disseminated or aggregate form. \n\nCentimetric to decimetric quartz venulations are common and may appear either concordant or \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\ncross-cut the foliation. The metapelitic rocks are constituted by quartz, carbonate, sericite, \n\nchlorite, graphite and silica, and display a granolepidoblastic texture. \n\nIn addition, carbonaceous schist (Figure 36A) contains thin films of sericite, quartz, and \n\ncarbonate. It has a thicknesses ranging from 0.5m to 3.0m and usually occurs associated with \n\nlayers of BIF.  \n\n \nFigure 36 - Lithotypes of the Sobradinho target. A-carbonaceous schist; B-Banded Iron Formation \n\ncomposed of quartz, carbonate and sulfide layers; C- Massive sulfide (aggregates of pyrrhotite); \n\nD-metabasic intrusive rock. \n \n\nMacroscopically, the BIF has its banding defined by milli-decimetric bands, with a \n\ncoloration of light gray to cream (iron carbonate bands), dark gray (carbonate-carbonaceous \n\nbands), white (quartz bands), and yellow (sulfide bands). The BIF (Figure 36B) consists of \n\nquartz, carbonates, and sulfides. Subordinately, it contains iron oxides, chlorite, carbonaceous \n\nfilms, sericite, and chloritoid. The quartz and carbonate are fine-grained and the texture is \n\nlaminated and granoblastic. The sulfide zones are predominantly composed of pyrite, but \n\naggregates of pyrrhotite crystals occur frequently in areas near the hinge (Figure 36C). The \n\nsporadic presence of chlorite in the BIF is interpreted as a result of contact metamorphism of \n\ndiabase dikes and sills usually observed at drilling intersections (Figure 36D). The intense folding \n\nthat affects the whole package is most noticeable in the BIF layer, which is about 350 m long, \n\nwith thicknesses ranging from 0.5m to 8.5m. \n\nStructurally, there is the presence of a persistent regional N20E-N50E foliation, dipping \n\n30\u00ba-55\u00ba to SE. Locally, boudin structures within the BIF are observed (Figure 37). Intersection \n\nlineations, mineral lineations, and quartz rods dip between 20\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 to E along an azimuth of \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\napproximately 85\u00b0 (Figure 38). The average attitude of mineral lineations in the area is \n\nN85E/35\u00b0ENE. \n\n \nFigure 37 \u2013 Old excavation in the friable and oxidized banded iron formation.

Sobradinho Target.\n\n\n\n67 \n\nGold-bearing Mineralization in the Sobradinho Target \n\nGold grades from borehole samples extracted from the Sobradinho target were not \n\navailable for this research. Only a few low grades of gold are known to date in oxidized BIF \n\nsamples obtained at shallow exploration trenches.  \n\nCore samples with high concentrations of sulfides (pyrrhotite + pyrite) mainly in BIF were \n\nused to create a 3D geological model. The model was generated on the basis of 8 drill holes \n\nlocated along a N30E section, and the surface geological map prepared using the geologic \n\ninformation yielded in the trenches. Intervals with 7% or more of sulfides are observed on some \n\nboreholes. Figure 39 shows an Ikonos true color composite imagery draped over a digital \n\nelevation model and their 3D integration with a geological section, drill holes and a wireframe \n\n(isosurface) of sulfidized BIF.   \n\n \nFigure 39 \u2013 3D integration of DEM plus Ikonos image, geological section, drill holes and \n\nwireframe of BIF with 3D limits. Sobradinho target \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n68 \n\nEM and IP Results from the Sobradinho Target \n\nEM data in the Sobradinho target show a well-defined electromagnetic conductive \n\nanomaly, although with a moderate intensity of the signal (<100mS/m). Figure 40 shows a 3D \n\nintegration of surface EM data (Tauz Channel), inverted EM showed as a raster block model \n\n(above the 90th percentile) and the geological section of the Sobradinho target. \n\n \nFigure 40 \u2013 3D visualization of surface EM data, inverted EM displayed as a raster block model \n\nand a geological section of the Sobradinho target.  \n\n \n\nThe modeled BIF layers enriched in sulfides presented a positive IP effect in the ground \n\ngeophysical survey. The results of chargeability presented on IP sections demonstrate that the \n\ndepths of IP anomalies correspond to the intersection of the geological model in each of the three \n\nsections. In addition, IP effect values are more intense here when compared to the other satellite \n\ntargets. This feature is due to the high ratios of pirrhotite/pyrite that occur in this deposit. Figure \n\n41 shows the integration of a 3D Ikonos imagery with three IP sections (chargeability) and a \n\nwireframe of the modeled BIF layer.   \n\n \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \nFigure 41 - 3D integration of the three IP sections with BIF wireframe. \n\n \n\nFigure 42 shows the resistivity results on IP-01 and IP-02 sections. Note that low \n\nresistivity values indicate that quartz masses are absent in mineralized areas indicated by drill \n\nholes and in the geological section. In this case, the absence of resistive rocks corroborates with \n\nnegative anomalies. Two other anomalies that appear on the lower left corner of Figure 41 \n\npossibly represent quartz-rich layers.     \n\nFigure 42 - 3D integration of IP-02 and IP-03 resistivity sections with a representative geological \n\nsection. Black lines/curves are drill holes. \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\n6.3 \u2013 BOM CAMINHO TARGET  \n\nThe Bom Caminho target is located on the southwestern limb of Serra da Piedade, \n\napproximately 3 km west of the Caet\u00e9 city.  \n\nTwo large open pit excavations and four smaller ones are observed in the area, with sizes \n\nranging from 100 m to 300 m in diameter (Figure 43). The pits are arranged in a general N30E \n\ndirection and so are the rocks layers, which dip to the SE. Shear zones trend to N20E and are \n\nsignificant structural features. The mineral lineation on shear planes has an attitude of 120/35\u00ba.  \n\nAs shown in Figure 43, the western portion of the area is composed of an upper unit \n\nconstituted of metapelites (X1), locally carbonaceous, with intercalations of acidic metavolcanic \n\nand subordinate intermediate rocks (man), as well as thin horizons of BIF. The central domain is \n\ncomposed of intercalations of basic and intermediate metavolcanic rocks with layers of BIFs. In \n\nthe eastern domain predominates the basal unit with mafic metavolcanic rocks with intercalations \n\nof ultrabasic metavolcanics and subordinately acid metavolcanics, locally with levels of \n\nmetachert (MCH). In the contact region with gneisses rocks, chlorite-rich phylonites are common.  \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \nFigure 43 - Schematic geological map of the region of the Bom Caminho target. The units \n\nreferred to belong to the Nova Lima Group. Source: Duchini Jr (1992). \n\n \n\nOverall, the dominant rock is a volcaniclastic greenish-gray schist, medium to coarsely-\n\ngrained. In drill cores, these rocks are foliated, with abundant sub-millimeter to millimeter dark, \n\ngray quartz crystals. Petrographic analysis revealed them to be volcanic quartz crystals (Vieira, \n\nDNPM Annual Report 1979). Locally, it is possible to distinguish, in the same rocks layers of \n\nmedium/fine sand fractions, silt and clay, which are useful in determining the top and base \n\nstratigraphic relationships. \n\nThe metapelitic rocks are regularly foliated and locally dark gray when enriched in \n\ncarbonaceous films. The metavolcaniclastic rocks, quartz-sericite-chlorite-carbonate-plagioclase \n\nschist, with frequent intersections in metric drilling intervals are affected by hydrothermalism \n\nrelated to carbonatation, chloritization, sericitization and, more rarely, sulphidization (mainly \n\npyrite). The crystals of pyrite, as a rule, are widespread; locally forming fillets aligned parallel to \n\nthe S2 foliation and in amounts generally less than 2%.  \n\nOLD  \n\nEXCAVATIONS \n\n\n\n72 \n\nLayers were intercepted in old exploratory drill holes with up to 7m of carbonaceous \n\nschist with incipient sulphidization, interlayered with metavolcaniclastics. \n\nIn the basal unit of the Nova Lima Group, outcrops of undifferentiated mafic schist, talc \n\nschist (Figure 44), serpentine, carbonaceous schist and the described metavolcaniclastics rocks \n\npredominate, with this set overlaying the Caet\u00e9 granite-gneiss in the extreme eastern of the area.   \n\n  \n\n \nFigure 44 \u2013 Decimetric level of weathered talc schist intercalated with metavolcaniclastic schist. \n\nBom Caminho target. \n\n \n\nDecimetric lenses of banded iron formation and sulphide quartz-carbonate veins occur in \n\na dispersed manner in the area, both associated with the median unit of the Nova Lima Group \n\n(Figure 45). \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \nFigure 45 \u2013 Banded iron formation intercalated with weathered metamorphic schist. Bom \n\nCaminho target. \n\n \n\nGold-bearing Mineralization of the Bom Caminho Target \n\nThe regularity of the foliation observed in the drilling cores, and the small number of \n\nquartz veins in the sections drilled in the past, showed the incipient existence of tectonism, which \n\ndoes not favor the development of hydrothermal fluids. However, the existence of reactive rocks \n\nsuch as BIFs, although localized, and the occurrence of rocks capable of causing the \"ponding\" of \n\nhydrothermal fluids (e.g., carbonaceous schist) could facilitate reactions that can alter the fluid, \n\nincluding sulphidization.  \n\nTwo IP geophysical sections were performed and assisted in establishing the possible \n\nplunge of the gold mineralization. In the past, regional plunge directions were tested in this target, \n\nwhich were different from the directions given by the IP survey results. \n\n \n\nEM and IP Geophysics of the Bom Caminho Target \n\nEM anomalies in the vicinity of the excavations motivated the need to program IP \n\nsections. Two N30E-trending sections were scheduled and submitted to the IP survey in order to \n\nestablish the resistive potential and chargeability of possible extensions in depth of the materials \n\nmined in the past and located inside the old excavations. The results from these sections reveal an \n\n\n\n74 \n\nIP anomaly positioned in the projection of larger excavations, with a plunge close to 120/35 and \n\nsub-parallel to the foliation (Figure 46). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 46 \u2013 Three-dimensional integration of the IP sections with surface data. Bom Caminho \n\ntarget. \n\n \n\n Programmed drill holes were positioned on chargeability anomalies and a group of \n\nanother IP section on East portion will help to understand better the mineralization of this area.    \n\n \n\n7 \u2013 GEOPHYSICAL SIGNATURES OF THE STUDY AREAS  \n\n \n\n Table 3 summarizes a group of geophysical signal intensities and sulfide grade data of \n\neach study area above described. With these data it is possible to compare and understand with \n\nmore clarity the characteristics of the mineralization in each area.  \n\n \n\n\n\n75 \n\nTable 3 \u2013 Geophysical signatures of the studied areas. \n\n \n\nSome explanations and comments about the Table 3 are described below: \n\n The grade of sulfide for each orebody of the Lamego deposit was obtained through the \n\nestimated block model in the same vertical plan of the IP section survey. On the other hand, the \n\nsulfide values of satellite targets were calculated direct from the composited samples of the drill \n\nholes. \n\n In general, the proportion of sulfide grades, intensity of chargeability and electromagnetic \n\nresults of Lamego\u00b4s orebodies and the satellite targets have a positive correlation. For high grades \n\nof sulfide the values of IP effect and EM results have high intensities. \n\n In general, the intensity of EM signal of Lamego deposit is greater than another satellite \n\ntargets. This can be explained by the thick envelope of carbonaceous schist that occurs there, \n\nwhile in satellite targets it occurs with minor proportions. Moreover, the carbonaceous schist \n\nbeyond to be electromagnetic conductor have frequently high grades of sulfides also. \n\n The EM values of Cabe\u00e7a de Pedra orebody is higher than the others bodies. This can be \n\nexplained because this orebody is positioned on the hinge of the big anti-form structure and \n\nconsequently the package of the carbonaceous schist becomes thicker and the two limbs closer to \n\nthe other, increasing the intensity of the EM signal.    \n\n The low values of resistivity in Cabe\u00e7a de Pedra could be associated to the high \n\nproportions of carbonaceous schist too, although the gray quartz packages are also relatively \n\nexpressive.   \n\n The high values of resistivity in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 target cannot be right.  This area was interpreted \n\nas the result of insufficient energy to cross the uneven surface. This problem may also be related \n\nto different rock types found at Lamego and the S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 Target; in other words, to their different \n\nrocky backgrounds. In addition, there are no EM anomalies in this area. \n\n\n\n76 \n\n The greater value of chargeability (33mV/V) is presented in Sobradinho target. In this \n\nDeposit the values of pirrhotite are greater than the others and possibly this mineral is more \n\nsensible to IP effect.  \n\n The low values of resistivity in Sobradinho target are coherent because the amount of \n\nsiliceous material there is scarce, only small layers of gray quartz can be found close to the BIF.   \n\n \n\n8 \u2013 MORRO DA GL\u00d3RIA DEPOSIT \n\nThe Morro da Gl\u00f3ria gold deposit, located southeast of Belo Horizonte (Figure 3), is \n\nconsidered as complementary study of this research and used as reference for the development of \n\nan exercise that focus on application of the multi-thematic fuzzy-Boolean models and inversion \n\nalgorithms to assist in integration of multi-source data, as presented in Guimar\u00e3es et al. (2006).  \n\n8.1 \u2013 Morro da Gl\u00f3ria Geological Settings  \n\nThe plunge of the main ore body at this deposit is structurally controlled by N75E -\n\ntrending fold axis, dipping 35\no\nNE.  The masses of gold-bearing sulphides are hosted by metric to \n\ndecametric layers of banded iron formation (BIF) and metachert parallel to the hinges of \n\nmesoscopic folds. The BIFs are interdigitated with carbon-rich schists, chlorite-quartz-mica \n\nschists and metandesites, which define distinct concentric zones of hydrothermal alterations near \n\nthe sulphide/mineralized bands.  \n\nThe known lithologies in the Morro da Gl\u00f3ria region are stratigraphically positioned in the \n\nbasal unit of the Nova Lima Group, which in turn forms the lower portion of the Rio das Velhas \n\nSupergroup in the QF.  \n\nThe dominant geomorphological feature in the Morro da Gl\u00f3ria region is the Serra dos \n\nTr\u00eas Irm\u00e3os, which is a reference for the structural analysis of the ore and has ridges that run in an \n\nE-W direction. This area consists of Banded Iron Formation - BIFs (with an estimated thickness \n\nbetween 50 and 60 metres), sericite-quartz schist, chloritic schist, and chloritic-quartz-\n\ncarbonated-sericitic schist, occasionally interdigitated with plagioclase-quartz-chlorite schist. \n\nThe BIF is the main host of the gold mineralization in the Morro da Gl\u00f3ria region. \n\nLocally, gold is also found associated with silica-rich levels (metachert). The characteristic \n\ncompositional banding of Morro da Gloria BIFs consists of alternating millimetric and \n\ncentimetric levels enriched with carbonate (ankerite), intercalated silica levels, ferrous-\n\n\n\n77 \n\nmagnesium and, subordinately, films of sericite.  Processes resulting in the substitution of \n\ncarbonate with sulphides (dominantly pyrite with lesser amounts of pyrrhotite and arsenopyrite) \n\nare characteristic of the advanced stage of hydrothermal alteration in these rocks. \n\nMetandesites form a stratigraphic unit below the BIFs. These rocks locally display \n\nvolcanic variolitic textures and frequently contain distinct halos of hydrothermal alteration.  \n\nVieira &amp; Oliveira (1988) define three concentric zones of hydrothermal alteration within gold \n\ndeposits hosted by greenstone sequences in the QF:  a chlorite-rich outer zone, a carbonate-rich \n\nintermediate zone and a sericite-rich inner zone, closer to the ore.  \n\n Stratigraphically, the Morro da Gl\u00f3ria region is set on a base of meta-ultramafic rocks, \n\nkomatiites, meta-andesites and basaltic komatiites, with their respective alteration products, \n\nfollowed by a banded iron formation and metachert, carbonaceous schists, covered by \n\ncarbonaceous metapelitics, gradually moving to metapelitics and felsic metatuffs. \n\nThe mineralized bodies occur mainly in massive sulphides (Figure 47A) associated with \n\nthe hinges of the mesoscopic folds essentially in contact with the BIF (Figure 47B) with \n\ncarbonaceous schists and subordinately in silificated zones with metachert sulphide. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 47: A \u2013 Massive Sulphide with aggregates of subeuhedral pyrite crystal; B) banded iron \n\nformation with folded features. \n\n \n\nThe meso-structures that are characteristic of the region are defined by the combination of \n\nsinformal folds, a host of bodies denominated as Mina Rica (southern part of Serra Tr\u00eas Irm\u00e3os) \n\nwith an axial plane between N65\no\nE and N80\n\no\nE, associated with an anti-form which is located at \n\nits hinge, the Santo Ant\u00f4nio and Vum-Vum bodies with an EW axial plane, both defined by the \n\n\n\n78 \n\nfolding of the primary layer S0 in the BIFs (Figure 48A).  This conjunction was created in the D1 \n\nphase which corresponds with a tectonic compression with a SSE vergence. \n\nFigures 48B and 48C, respectively, show the simplified 3D configurations of the different \n\nlithologies and main ore bodies spatially projected in the Morro da Gl\u00f3ria region.  The directions \n\nand angles of the average plunges of the ore bodies in the Morro da Gl\u00f3ria region vary between \n\nN70E and N85E, dipping between 30 and 40 degrees. \n\n \n\nFigure 48 \u2013 A \u2013 Underground geological map of level 4 (level 770m); B \u2013 three dimensional  \n\nconfiguration of main lithologies; C \u2013 main ore bodies projected in depth.  \n\n \n\n8.2 - Dataset \n\nThe data set used in this research is summarized in Figure 49.  Figure 49A is a digital \n\nterrain model (DTM) with a geological map of the surface and the location of the 61 diamond \n\ndrill holes.  Figure 49B is a three dimensional geological model created using the borehole \n\ninformation together with surface and subsurface maps for levels 3 and 4.  \n\n\n\n79 \n\nThe geochemical analyses of the soil in this region were performed during the 90\u2019s.  \n\nSamples were collected at 40 meters intervals along lines spaced approximately 100m apart \n\n(Figure 49C).  Sediments in the region were sampled and analyzed in 2007.  The analytical \n\nchemical results from stream sediments samples were represented by anomalous basin limits \n\n(Figure 49D). \n\nFigure 49E illustrates a set of old excavations plotted on old maps and checked in the \n\nfield.  A group of gold-bearing ore bodies were modeled from the boreholes and chip channels \n\ncollected on underground galleries between level 2 and level 4 (Figure 49F).  The old excavation \n\nlimits were also used to generate solid/wireframes and connected using the combined information \n\nin areas where there was no geochemical information regarding gold and sulphur at shallow \n\ndepths and at the surface. \n\nFigures 49G and 49H illustrate the results of the Spectrem airborne-geophysical survey \n\nperformed in 2002. Figure 49G shows the analytical signal of the total magnetic field and Figure \n\n49H is the Tauz channel product from the electromagnetic survey. \n\nThe main characteristics of the aero-geophysical survey performed by AngloGold Ashanti \n\nBrasil Minera\u00e7\u00e3o Ltda (AGAM), called Spectrem Airborne Electromagnetic Survey \u2013 2002\u201d, are \n\ndescribed in Figure 18.  The flight lines are spaced 200m apart at N22\no\nW, which is almost \n\nperpendicular to the direction of the ore body plunges in this region. \n\n8.3 - Methods \n\nThe procedures used in the preparation and three dimensional analysis of the data, upon \n\nwhich this study is based, can be summarized in the following steps:  (1) field investigation;  (2) \n\nthree dimensional modeling of the mineralized gold-bearing bodies, ferriferous formations  and \n\nmetachert (quartz horizons), including exploration and channel data;  (3)  processing information \n\nfrom old excavations and geochemical analytical results for soils and stream sediments;  (4)  \n\npreprocessing and processing aerial geophysical  information (Spectrem Aerial Survey, 2002), \n\nincluding electromagnetic data inversion and developing the three dimensional block matrix;  (5) \n\nprojection of surface information underground;  (6) generation of horizontal sections, developing \n\nthe two dimensional limits of the intersections of each theme  analyzed;  (7)  evaluation of \n\nanomalies using the multi-thematic fuzzy-Boolean model and the development of a preliminary \n\nthree dimensional model;  (8)  comparative analysis of the preliminary fuzzy-Boolean model with \n\nthe known ore bodies;  (9)  readjustment of the three dimensions based on the positions of the \n\n\n\n80 \n\nknown ore bodies;  (10)  comparative analysis between anomalous spots defined in the fuzzy-\n\nBoolean model, known ore bodies and the results of the aerial electromagnetic data inversion \n\nprocess;  (11)  analysis of new modeled anomalous targets and programming of additional \n\nexploration to investigate potential anomalies. \n\n\n\n81 \n\n \nFigure 49 - Schematic configuration of Morro da Gloria data (A) surface geological map; (B) 3D \n\ngeological model; (C) Au soil anomalies projected in depth; (D) catchment basins built from \n\nstream sediment gold values; (E) ancient excavations; (F) main known ore bodies; (G) analytical \n\nsignal of total magnetic field; (H) Tauz channel of electromagnetic survey.  \n\n\n\n82 \n\n \n\nField Investigation \n\nThe main magnetic and electromagnetic anomalies, as well as geochemical anomalies and \n\nthe limits of old excavations were verified in the field.  There are known banded iron formations \n\nwhich are strongly compacted, dark grey in color and contain euhedral crystals of magnetite \n\nlocated mainly on the crest of the Serra dos Tr\u00eas Irm\u00e3os, where the magnetic anomaly is more \n\npronounced. Additionally, areas where there are soil anomalies, the banded iron formation is \n\nmore heavily weathered and is light grey in color with crystals of pyrite and limonite. The \n\npresence of magnetite decreases significantly in these areas. In the area of old excavations, only \n\nschistose rocks are apparent because practically all the sulphide material, possibly mineralized, \n\nwas extracted in the past. However, residual BIFs with incipient sulphidation were seen in the \n\nwalls of some of the gullies. \n\nThree Dimensional Geological Modeling \n\nTwo 3D geological models were generated for the Morro da Gl\u00f3ria deposit using 3D \n\nmodeling software (Datamine). The first model corresponds to the limits of the mineralized gold-\n\nbearing ore bodies which were generated from the analytical results from the boreholes and \n\nunderground galleries channels of levels 3 and 4.  Only results greater than 2g/t in composite \n\nsamples were considered in this model.  The second corresponds to the banded iron formation \n\npackages independently modeled.  However, metachert and venulous quartz packages as well as \n\ndiabase dykes were also individually modeled in three dimensions. This model was also based on \n\nsurface geological contact limits, old geological maps of levels 3 and 4, as well as lithological \n\ninformation from the boreholes and channels. \n\nProcessing the Geochemical Information of Soils and Sediments \n\nThe chemical analysis results of the soil were interpolated using the minimum curvature \n\nmethod and the anomalous areas were categorized as illustrated in Figure 4C.  Results falling \n\nwithin the limits of 0.15g/t to 1.6g/t were considered anomalous in this region.  In this study, the \n\nchemical analysis results of the sediment samples were represented by semi-automatically defined \n\nanomalous basin limits, starting with a base three dimensional topographic scale hybrid of \n\n1:25,000 and 1:2000 (Figure 4D).  Sediment analysis results falling within the limits of 0.1g/t to \n\n0.7g/t were considered anomalous in this region. \n\n\n\n83 \n\nAirborne Geophysical Results at Morro da Gl\u00f3ria \n\nThe Morro da Gl\u00f3ria region is characterized by resistive host rock with electromagnetic \n\nconductive horizons associated essentially with carbonaceous schists, BIF with some magnetite \n\nand, subordinately, schistose rocks or metachert with possible enrichment of sulphides which \n\noften contain auriferous mineralizations. The magnetic anomalies were already characterized \n\nmainly by iron formations with magnetite, as shown in Figure 49G. \n\nIn this region the layer of weathering rock is not very thick or conductive; this makes the \n\ninterpretation of the data relatively straight forward, with the exception of where the layers plunge \n\nrelatively smoothly. Where the plunges are less than 25 degrees, it becomes difficult to determine \n\nthe exact direction of the dip from the aerial electromagnetic data.  However, the plunge of the \n\nsulphide and mineralized bodies in the area reach as much as 35 degrees in some places, \n\nfacilitating the interpretation process. \n\nThe result of the aerial investigation by Spectrem survey, represented by the TAUZ \n\nchannel (i.e. one of the channels used for the investigation at deeper levels), shows anomalies \n\nwith the presence of electromagnetic conductive rocks in areas corresponding to the projection of \n\nthe main deep ore bodies, followed by the preferred plunge directions, mainly in the Santo \n\nAnt\u00f4nia and Mina Rica bodies (Figure 50). \n\n\n\n84 \n\n \nFigure 50: (A) Product derived from airborne electromagnetic data - TAUZ Channel. (B) TAUZ \n\nChannel plus geological contacts. The main known ore bodies (Mina Rica, Santo Ant\u00f4nio, Vum-\n\nVum and Esperan\u00e7a) are shown with their respective average plunge directions.    \n\nIn order to correlate the three dimensional underground information with the aerial \n\nelectromagnetic data, the inversion process was performed. \n\nGeophysical Inversion of EM Data \u2013 Morro da Gl\u00f3ria  \n\n The geophysical inversion process in this study was applied only to the Tauz channel \n\nwhich is one of the channels used in the investigation of deeper levels and that produces the best \n\ncorrelations in terms of the projection of known sulphide bodies (Figure 51). \n\n The inversion was performed on the electromagnetic conductivity data. It was processed \n\nfor the entire survey and did not effectively considered information regarding three dimensional \n\ncartographic solid volumes. Therefore, this approach differs from the Oldenburg &amp; Pratt (2007) \n\nType I inversion, since no known form or combinations of geometric shape were used during the \n\ninversion process. \n\nThis study used a three dimensional block diagram as a reference model whose the upper \n\nface of the model corresponded with the surface topography and was properly shift down to a \n\ndepth of 150m. Parameterization exercises varying the functions of weight and the variables that \n\n\n\n85 \n\ncontrol the smoothing in various directions were performed throughout the entire survey in order \n\nto obtain a direct inverted model, in which the electromagnetic conductors correlated vertically \n\nwith the main gold-bearing deposits in regions such as Cuiab\u00e1, Lamego and other smaller \n\ndeposits such as Morro da Gl\u00f3ria. The result obtained for the inversion process in this study of \n\nthe Morro da Gl\u00f3ria region is shown in Figure 51. \n\n \nFigure 51:  Raster blocks of electromagnetic Tauz channel of Morro da Gl\u00f3ria region.  \n\n \n\nAlthough Oldenburg &amp; Pratt (2007) considered that three dimensional geological models \n\ncould be incorporated and used in conjunction with a pure inversion, the authors also postulated \n\nthat the main characteristic of a Type II inversion is a direct property inversion, - the process used \n\nin this study. \n\nThe information used in the three dimensional models of ore bodies or complex solids \n\nresulting from the geological interpretation of sulphide BIFs can be used in future studies as \n\nsolids or reference models that are Type III inversions.   In this case, the solids can be filled and \n\nused as reference models to adjust and better refine direct inversion or pure physical property \n\ninversions.  \n\n \n\n\n\n86 \n\nProjection of Depth and Horizontal Slices of the Analyzed Subjects; \n\nAfter completing the pre-processing, processing and the integration of the themes into the \n\npreviously discussed GIS platform, the projection on depth of the information is applied, \n\ngenerating horizontal slices which allows for the creation of two dimensional limits of the \n\nintersection of each analyzed subject (Figure 49). \n\nThe plunge of the ore bodies in this orogenetic deposit are structurally controlled mainly \n\nby fold axes in N75E/35\no\nNE direction.  Therefore, the geochemical information of the sediment, \n\nsoil and magnetic anomalies was projected according to the average direction and plunge ore \n\nbody, while the limits of the old excavations follow the directions and plunges of each know ore \n\nbodies varying between N70E and N85\no\nE with plunges between 30 and 40 degrees to the NE. \n\nMulti-Thematic Fuzzy-Boolean Model \n\nThe fuzzy analysis in this study has the objective of qualitatively select three dimensional \n\nvolumes and solids on the surface and underground through fuzzy logic applied to the processed \n\nthemes in order to heirarchize the known auriferous areas and locate new potentials for \n\ninvestigation. \n\nThe fuzzy logic theory (Bonham-Carter, 1994), holds a continuous scale of pertinence to \n\nthe set of studied data varying from 1.0 (total pertinence) down to 0.0 (non-pertinence). Thus, \n\nindividual measurements of a variable can be classified according to the degree of relevance to \n\nthe \u201cAnomaly\u201d (Bonham-Carter, 1994).  Very high values are likely anomalies, having a fuzzy \n\npertinence (fuzzy membership) of \u201cone\u201d.  Between these two extremes, there is a whole range of \n\npossible values of pertinence.  The combination between the evidence maps was established \n\nthrough fuzzy operators (An et al. 1991; Bonham-Carter 1994).  The operator \u201cFuzzy AND\u201d \n\ncorresponds to the Boolean \u201cAND\u201d, and when applied in a continuous distribution (such as \n\ncontained in the range from 0 to 1), it returns the lowest value from amongst the evidence.  The \n\noperator \u201cFuzzy OR\u201d (equivalent to the Boolean \u201cOR\u201d), returns the greatest value from amongst \n\nthe evidence when applied to a continuous distribution.  The Fuzzy Algebraic Product (P) \n\nconsists of the product between the evidences and has a minimizing character in the sense that the \n\nfinal product is the result of the combination of various evidence maps through the multiplication \n\nof values in the 0 to 1 range.  Consequently, lower values are derived from those contained in the \n\ninput maps Since the Fuzzy Algebraic Sum (S) simply consists of the sum of various evidence \n\nmaps and has a characteristic inversion of the Algebraic Fuzzy Product, in which the fuzzy \n\n\n\n87 \n\nmembership values add up resulting in a product in which the values of the final map are greater \n\nthan those on the evidence maps.  Figure 52A gives examples of results supplied by these \n\noperators, starting with illustrative input data. \n\nIn the spatial analysis defined by mineral favorability maps, the Fuzzy operators \u201cAND\u201d \n\nor \u201cOR\u201d are not routinely used and do not, in fact, represent a superposition of the effects of each \n\nof the input maps. The satisfactory combination of the evidence maps is done through the \u201cFuzzy \n\nProduct\u201d and \u201cFuzzy Sum\u201d operators. However, the most effective way to counteract the \n\nminimizing effect of the \u201cFuzzy Product\u201d and the maximizing effect of the \u201cFuzzy Sum\u201d is \n\nobtained through the Fuzzy Gama operator (G) (Bonham-Carter 1994) (see Figure 52A). \n\nThe Fuzzy Gamma operator is defined in terms of the Fuzzy Product and Fuzzy Sum in \n\nthe form (Bonham-Carter 1994): \n\nG = (S)\n? \n* (P)\n\n(1-?) \n. \n\nWhere the ? (gamma), situated in the range between 0 to 1 and defines the additive or subtractive \n\ncontribution of Fuzzy Sum and Fuzzy Product operators.  Using ?=1, the Fuzzy Gamma operator \n\ncorresponds to the Fuzzy Algebraic Sum (essentially in an additive character), therefore, when \n\n?=0, the Fuzzy Gama operator will correspond to the Fuzzy Algebraic Product and have a \n\nsubtractive character (Figure 52B).   Choosing the value for ? is the responsibility of the analyst \n\nand depends on the type of response one wishes to find. \n\n \nFigure 52 \u2013 A \u2013 Summary of fuzzy operators; B \u2013 comparative curve of fuzzy operators and \n\nvariation as a function of different input gamma values (modified Bonham-Carter 1994).  \n\n\n\n88 \n\nExamples of the use of fuzzy logic in mineral research are abundant in literature (An et al. \n\n1991; Bonham-Carter et al. 1988; Bonham-Carter 1994; Bonham-Carter 1997; Braghin 1998; \n\nChinn &amp; Ascough 1997; N\u00f3brega 2001, Nyk\u00e4nen 2008), etc. \n\nIn this study, the evidences were combined through the operator Fuzzy Gama.  The value \n\nused for ? was 0.9 (stronger additive contribution). The classification of the evidence map in the \n\nfuzzy memberships was defined in terms of a subjective evaluation by the specialist, and in this \n\ncase the categorical information was: lithological information, soil and sediment geochemical \n\ndata, old excavation limits and aerial magnetometry geophysical results (Figure 49). \n\nThe final map of surface favorability was generated from the application of the operator \n\nGamma=0.9 from the fuzzy analysis, starting with a table of weights which were previously \n\ncategorized by the sensitivity of the geological knowledge (Table 4). \n\nTable 4: Scheme of weights used in the fuzzy gamma method. \n\n \n\nThe geochemical model with the three dimensional ore body limits was produced with the \n\ninterpretation of the exploration data and channels from the underground galleries serving as a \n\ncalibration reference for the predictive fuzzy Boolean model. \n\nThe most know gold-bearing deposits in the Quadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero, independent of their \n\nsize, have records of old surface studies, with a strong remobilization of material, and promoting \n\nthe creation of gullies and ravines which are very prominent today.  These geomorphological \n\nfeatures are well marked at the Cuiab\u00e1, Mina Velha and Raposos mines and have also developed \n\nin the Morro da Gloria region.  For this reason, in the measurement of weights, the excavation \n\nlimits is the category with the greatest value (Table 4). \n\nAlthough all the excavations have the same weight in this study, they could also be sub-\n\ndivided and attributed varying weights for different parametric dimensions (Figure 49E).  The ore \n\nbodies modeled using the boreholes and channels from underground galleries at levels 2 to 4 were \n\n\n\n89 \n\nnot used as a subject in the fuzzy analysis, but were considered in the quality control of the fuzzy \n\nproduct. \n\nBefore projecting each theme in depth following the average direction and plunge of the \n\nore bodies, it is necessary to project the vectors of each one which was mapped previously in a \n\ntwo dimensional plane in a digital terrain model. This procedure is necessary so that each piece of \n\ninformation has its real expression effectively reproduced in the three dimensional surface, \n\nthereby maximizing the cartographic accuracy and giving a true representation of the superficial \n\nterrestrial data. \n\n8.4 - Comparative Results of Applied Methods at Morro da Gl\u00f3ria Deposit \n\nThe results of this study correspond to mineral favorability maps generated from the \n\napplication of fuzzy operators to the discrete themes, as well as the product of the inversion \n\nprocess applied in aerial geophysical electromagnetic conductivity data.  The results also \n\ncorrespond well to a comparative analysis between the products produced in this study and to \n\nknown ore bodies. \n\nFigure 53 shows the surface mineral favorability map with the fuzzy membership scale \n\nestablished as a function of the weights used in Table 4.  The anomalous areas calculated on the \n\nsurface reveal a potential region in the form of an oval, which had not been observed in previous \n\nstudies. On the surface, this form resembles the main feature of the Cuiab\u00e1 mine which is a world \n\nclass deposit in the QF.  Although the region of the Vum-Vum target is composed of a thick layer \n\nof BIF and presents geomorphological expression, the main anomaly region is in the area of the \n\nSanto Ant\u00f4nio and Mina Rica ore bodies.  The latter has a lower geomorphologic expression and \n\nhosts sulphide horizons in thinner BIF layers with small horizons of metachert. This \n\nconfiguration suggests that this maybe be considered as a deposit with expressive potential, at \n\nleast in terms of exploration. \n\n \n\n\n\n90 \n\n \nFigure 53 \u2013 Surface final fuzzy map of Morro da Gl\u00f3ria region.  \n\n \n\nThe limits of the old excavations were also projected to depth following average direction \n\nand plunges of each of the known ore bodies (since the majority of these excavations involved a \n\nmineralized gold-bearing body). The soil and sediment geochemical information and magnetic \n\nanomalies were also projected according to the average plunge of the known mineralized bodies \n\n(N75E/35\no\nN). The 3D lithological model was generated from the exploration information, the \n\ngeological map of 770m level and a geological surface map.  The horizontal mineral favorability \n\nmaps were then calculated at 75m intervals (Figure 54). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n91 \n\n \nFigure 54: Underground multiple fuzzy gamma results (for each 75m).  \n\n \n\nComparing the results of the three dimensional sections that were modeled through the \n\napplication of the proposed methods with the known mineral bodies down to level 4, and \n\nprojecting these bodies to depth, an excellent correlation was obtained.  New anomalous volumes \n\nwith considerable exploration potential were also modeled and recorded as having follow-up \n\ninvestigation potential (Figure 55). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n92 \n\n \nFigure 55: Multiple fuzzy gamma maps vs. modeled orebodies based on chemical results from \n\ndrillholes.  \n\n \n\nSpecial mention must be made in relation to the projection of information to very \n\nsignificant depths.  It is not advisable to project the results to depths beyond the levels of \n\navailable information. Thus, the greater the distance between the levels of existing information \n\nand the last modeled section, the lower the accuracy of the modeling process.  The projection of \n\ninformation to a certain depth also depends on the behavioral characteristics and geological and \n\nstructural complexity of each deposit. It is the responsibility of the analyst to define the maximum \n\ndepth of the model.  The gold bearing deposits of the QF have distinct characteristics and are \n\nquite diverse with regard to continuity and variability in depth, therefore care must be taken when \n\nestablishing the final depth of the model. \n\nOn the other hand, the results of the direct inversion on the electromagnetic conductivity \n\ndata (Tauz channel) in the Morro da Gl\u00f3ria (Figure 56) revealed three suggestive indications in \n\nthe understanding and characterization of the geological deposit: \n\n \n\n\n\n93 \n\n \nFigure 56: AEM raster matrix model clipped to the furthest underground development. The \n\ndiagram shows the high correlation between the beginning of the AEM 3D anomaly and level 4 \n\n(770m) of the mine (actual level under development). Dotted blue line shows the anomaly \n\ninflection at depth.  \n\n \n\n(i) The estimated depth defined by the beginning of the electromagnetic conductive anomaly \n\ncoincides very well with the level of underground development where the mine was stopped \n\n(770m). This indicates that above this level, the sulphide mass, which characterized an anomaly \n\nat a higher level, was already extracted.  Therefore, the method had the capacity to define very \n\nwell the depth of the start of the conductive sulphide material, which is still present in this \n\nlocation (Figure 56); \n\n (ii) Almost all of the large gold-bearing deposits in the QF show, at depths below 500m \n\n(depending also of the size of the deposit), a softening/flat of the plunge angle of the ore body \u2013 a \n\nphenomena related to the regional deformation. In this case, below the 400m level, the conductive \n\nanomaly also showed smoothing, indicating the probable continuity of the mineralized body at \n\ndepth according to the illustration on Figure 56, indicated by the dotted blue line; \n\n (iii) The presence of additional anomalies, which are outside the coverage limits of the fuzzy \n\nanalysis, indicated new potential targets (Figure 58). \n\n\n\n94 \n\nThe results obtained from the inversion process of the electromagnetic conductivity \n\ninformation, could be incorporated as a new theme in further fuzzy analyses which was \n\nperformed using only geochemical, geological and magnetic data.  However, there are restrictions \n\nto this type of joint analysis. Amongst the disadvantages of using the product of the geophysical \n\ninversion in the fuzzy analysis are:  (i) the inadequate resolution of the blocks in the inverted \n\nmodel (50m).  The ore bodies are restricted and this resolution is not sufficient for greater detail; \n\n(ii) at shallow depths, the electromagnetic conductivity intensity values are low for this type of \n\ninversion which causes negative interference on the product of fuzzy operations at levels close to \n\nthe surface. \n\nNevertheless, it was possible to compare and analyze the results together, since they are \n\ngrouped together into the same computational platform.  A three dimensional cubic cut from the \n\ninverted model is shown in Figure 57 together with the fuzzy section from 395m.  It can be seen \n\nthat the product of the inversion volumetrically coincides well with the gamma product from he \n\nfuzzy logic near this depth.  The smoothing of the EM anomaly at depth shown in the inverted \n\nmodel in Figures 56 and 57, exemplarily confirms real smoothing of the ore body plunge, as \n\npreviously interpreted. Therefore, one should be cautious when making interpretations based on \n\nproduct derived from indirect data alone. \n\n \nFigure 57: AEM voxel model integrated with a horizontal slice (level 395) yielded from the fuzzy \n\ngamma product.  \n\n \n\n\n\n95 \n\n Figures 58A and 58B show a section with the results from the fuzzy analysis at a depth of \n\n595m with two different thresholds of the inverted geophysical model:  80\nth\n\n and 90\nth\n\n percentiles \n\nrespectively. \n\nThe anomalies in the inverted models are represented by transparent parallelepipeds in \n\nblack. These figures show that for this level, an excellent correlation exists between the \n\nanomalous areas in red and the fuzzy analysis in magenta. Furthermore, blocks with \n\nelectromagnetic intensities above the 80\nth\n\n percentile (Figure 58A), also reveal a continuity in the \n\nelectromagnetic conductive anomaly, although lower in the both north and south, which extends \n\nthe prospective potential of the deposit. \n\n Figure 58B also indicates the existence of a prominent correlation between the two \n\nmodels.  However, this correlation is not as expressive in the shallower sections.  In this case, the \n\nvolumes of the three dimensional solids at shallower depths were not used in the inversion \n\nprocess in this study. \n\n \n\n\n\n96 \n\n \nFigure 58: AEM inverted model with different thresholds. (A) percentile 80. (B) Percentile 90. \n\nThe model is shown combined with a slice (level 595) extracted from the fuzzy gamma product. \n\n \n\n \n\n9 \u2013 CONCLUSIONS \n\nThe main conclusions from this study are as follows:  \n\nWith regard to chargeability and resistivity, the IP1 geophysical survey sections generated \n\nresults highly correlated to known orebodies of the Lamego deposit. The conductive anomalies \n\nresulting from inversion of the EM data also corroborated with the IP data and location of \n\nexisting orebodies.  \n\n\n\n97 \n\nThe IP2 and IP3 sections show no consistent continuities for the orebodies along the \n\nplunge. Nonetheless, they revealed acceptable estimated depths of the geophysical anomalies in \n\nthe Carruagem orebody. \n\nA significant anomaly in the Arco NE body confirmed the presence of high volume of \n\nsulfide in this orebody, despite having insignificant gold content. \n\nThe IP sections contributed to showing the southern continuity of the Carruagem body, \n\nwhich was subsequently confirmed by the positive results of the surface exploration drilling. \n\nA large anomaly located in the northeastern extension of the Carruagem body was \n\nmodeled and tested. The results obtained by drilling did not confirm this anomaly, which was \n\ninterpreted as the result of insufficient energy to cross the uneven surface. This problem may also \n\nbe related to different rock types found at Lamego and the S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 Target; in other words, to \n\ntheir different rocky backgrounds. In addition, there are no EM anomalies in this area. \n\nAt the S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 target, the integration of data from geological mapping, soil geochemistry, \n\nIP and excavations has so far resulted in exploratory success for drill holes. \n\nThe IP anomalies in the Biquinha, Sobradinho and Bom Caminho targets exhibited a good \n\ncorrelation with geological and geochemical surface information projected following the dip \n\ndirection on underground. \n\nThe summarized table with the main characteristics of sulfide proportions of the Lamego \n\norebodies and satellite targets, together with a group of geophysical intensities from different \n\nsurveys, was capable to characterize some orebodies rich in sulfides and consequently with \n\npossibilities of having good gold grades.  \n\nThe techniques and methods combined in this research, coupled with the information \n\ndisplayed in Table 3, can be useful in future mineral exploration for areas with limited  surface \n\ngeological information. This would be particularly relevant in green field projects and in areas \n\nwhere thick weathering layers are  predominant. \n\n The results obtained from the method of subjecting multiple horizontal sections to fuzzy \n\nlogic operators presents significant geometrical correlation with the product of the geophysical \n\ninversion process of the electromagnetic conductivity data in Morro da Gl\u00f3ria deposit, albeit at \n\ndifferent resolutions or scales. \n\n\n\n98 \n\n\n\n99 \n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\nORDINARY KRIGING AND CONDITIONAL SIMULATION TO \n\nSUPPORTQUANTITATIVE ESTIMATION AND RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION AT \n\nTHE LAMEGO GOLD DEPOSIT \u2013 QUADRIL\u00c1TERO FERR\u00cdFERO - BRAZIL \n\nSUMMARY  \n\nThe Lamego gold deposit is located in the northwestern sector of the Quadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero \n\n(State of Minas Gerais, Brazil), along the Cuiab\u00e1 gold mine trend. Its economic and technical pre-\n\nfeasibility study was approved in September/2009. This deposit is hosted by Neoarchean rocks of the \n\nNova Lima Group, Rio das Velhas Supergroup. It is situated in an antiform structure, comprising a \n\nperimeter of 4.8 km, with a NE-trending axis and limbs dipping 25\u00ba to ESE. The mineralization \n\ncomprises the Carruagem, Cabe\u00e7a de Pedra, Arco da Velha and Queimada orebodies, which are \n\nhosted mainly by hydrothermally altered banded iron formations (BIFs) and quartz veins. Gold occurs \n\nas free specks or associated to pyrite grains. The mineralized horizons are located above the meta-\n\nmafic rocks and below carbonaceous, meta-pelitic and meta-volcanoclastic schists. The mineralization \n\nis interpreted as of mesothermal type, with concentric hydrothermal zones. From the unalterated, inner \n\nto proximal ore zones, domains rich in chlorite, carbonate and sericite are observed predominantly in \n\nthe meta-mafic rocks, whereas sulfidization occurs mainly in BIF and associated to quartz veins. \n\nPresently, the geological resources at Lamego are around 1.3MOz and mineable resources are \n\napproximately 370KOz. \n\nThis work aims to evaluate both ordinary kriging and conditional simulation methods to \n\nsupport quantitative estimation, characterization and classification of the Lamego deposit. Some 900 \n\ndrill holes and 1500 underground channels support the geostatistical analysis. The purpose of ordinary \n\nkriging is to estimate gold grade values in the blocks for which there are no samples, involving those \n\nbetween two developed mine levels, or those between surface and/or underground core-drilling \n\nsectors. Conditional simulations are used for accessing the uncertainties interrelated to the \n\nclassification of the deposit, as well as for generating probabilistic estimates of the parameters that \n\nshall honor the variability of the sampled populations. Spatial distribution resulting from the calculated \n\nvalues makes it possible to access the uncertainty. For calculations of the uncertainty in panels relating \n\nto quarterly or annual periods, the Sequential Gaussian Simulation was the method employed, which \n\ngenerates a distribution of 100 possibilities or realizations of grades and thicknesses for each estimated \n\nSMU (Selective Mining Unit). \n\nConclusions on metallogenic aspects of the Lamego deposit were yielded on the basis of \n\ngeostatistical analysis. The mean gold distribution of the horizontal volumetric panels indicates that \n\ngold grades are lower with increasing depth both in the Carruagem and Arco da Velha orebodies. \n\nConversely, the mean gold distribution of the vertical volumetric panels indicates that gold grades \n\nslightly increase following the north direction. This feature can be associated to deformation episodes \n\n(that are coincident to the mineralizing hydrothermal fluid accumulation at those sites) and/or to \n\nstructural traps in the northern sectors of the aforementioned orebodies. The bivariate study of Au and \n\nS (scatter plots) was probably the most significant to define the guide reefs of the Lamego deposit. \n\nThe correlation coefficients vary for different orebodies. In the Carruagem orebody this factor is much \n\nlower (0.22) than the others. Therefore, geostatistics highlighted a population with high gold and low \n\nsulfur grades, which is of key importance. At these sites gold is frequently associated to micro-\n\nfractured, gray quartz veins and occurs as free gold. This makes difficult the visual control of such \n\norebodies during underground development since the classic targeting method is guided by observable \n\nhigh concentration of sulfides at the outcrops.  \n \n\n\n\n100 \n\n\n\n101 \n\n1 \u2013 HISTORICAL DATA  \n\n \n\nThe Lamego gold deposit, owned by AngloGold Ashanti Brasil Minera\u00e7\u00e3o Ltda, is sited \n\nin the northwestern part of the Quadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero (Iron Quadrangle) metallogenetic province \n\n- a historic producer of gold, iron, manganese and limestone, as well as other mineral \n\ncommodities. It has been studied since 1981. From 1985 to 1990, a surface exploratory program \n\nwas carried out along 5.7 km of iron formation, when the existence of 27 different mineralized \n\nzones hosted in gray quartz veins and banded iron formation were revealed. These mineralized \n\nzones were later designated as Arco da Velha, Queimada and Cabe\u00e7a de Pedra orebodies. \n\nFor the purpose of making a detailed evaluation of the sulfate potential of these orebodies, \n\na ramp was developed, from level 932m to level 1, at an elevation of 880m, where the \n\naforementioned orebodies were exposed. The obtained results from this campaign were not \n\nsufficient to support the feasibility of the project. The activities stopped and the drifts were \n\nflooded in 1997. \n\nA new drilling campaign began in 2001, targeting the recently discovered Carruagem \n\norebody. The results of this campaign were positive and supported a new approach to the Project, \n\nassociated with the Cuiab\u00e1 mine expansion. Dewatering of the drifts started in 2002 and a new \n\ndescending ramp was excavated for the purpose of intercepting the Carruagem target at the 744m \n\nelevation. A conceptual study was issued in December 2004, motivating the approval of a pre-\n\nfeasibility study. \n\nThe oxidized portion of the deposit is currently being mined by MSOL-Jaguar Mining Inc. \n\nThe geological resources of the Lamego deposit (reference date July 2008) approximates \n\n4,100,000 tonnes with in situ average gold grade of  4.3g/t. This amounts to approximately 42.4 \n\ntons of gold, with 8% of the total metal content being classified as measured, 29% as indicated, \n\nand 63% as inferred. Mineable resources at Carruagem, Cabe\u00e7a de Pedra and Arco da Velha \n\norebodies (reference date July 2008) sum up to 2,164 ktonnes with a gold grade of 5.01 g/t.  \n\nThe objective of this work is to apply a group of geostatistical methods, particularly \n\nordinary kriging and conditional simulation, to estimate the metallic content of the Lamego \n\ndeposit; to assist the classification of the ore in terms of measured, indicated and inferred \n\nresources, depending on the confidence level of the estimate; and to advance the present geologic \n\nand metallogenetic knowledge of the deposit.  \n\n\n\n102 \n\nProcessing steps that precede the ordinary kriging includes geologic modeling, spatial data \n\nexploration, generation of adjusted sample composites, probability distribution function analysis, \n\ninvestigation of scatterplots between different variables, capping definition, variogram fitting and \n\ndefinition of a set of input parameters for kriging. \n\nConditional simulations are used here to assess the uncertainties comprised in the \n\nevaluation of the deposit, as well as for generating probabilistic estimates of the parameters that \n\nshall confirm the variability of the samples. The results of the conditional simulation are \n\nemployed to assist the classification of the resources. \n\n \n\n2 - MINERAL RESOURCES \n\nLamego\u2019s mineral resources are represented by individual block models in the five major \n\norebodies of the deposit. The block models were generated by ordinary kriging estimation \n\nconsidering 3D geologic models for each orebody. The geologic models were developed based on \n\nmultiple sections positioned orthogonal to the plunge of the mineralized horizons, allowing the \n\nuse of all available geochemical results. These include Au-grades from samples extracted from \n\nchannels at the development fronts and from drilling cores.  The sets of attributes for the block \n\nmodels are described in table 1. \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Attributes used in the block models for the Lamego deposit orebodies. \n\nAttribute Description \n\nZONE \n\nDesignates the mineralization zones.

They \n\nwere used for quantitative estimation of grades and volumes of the orebodies and to support the \n\n\n\n103 \n\nfinal figures related to the metal content of the Lamego deposit. The purpose of ordinary kriging \n\nis to estimate gold grade values in the blocks for which there are no samples, involving those \n\nbetween two developed mine levels, or those between surface and/or underground core-drilling \n\nsectors. It is based on a set of channel and core samples selected from the wireframes of the \n\ngeological models, and also studies of the 3D trends of the grades along the plunge, strike, and \n\nthickness. \n\n2.1 - Database \n\nPractically all the orebodies consist of a group of small enriched horizons. They were \n\nindividualized in discontinuous wireframes. The entire Carruagem orebody extends \n\napproximately 290m along the strike, with significant discontinuities. The total length of the \n\nunderground galleries developed at Carruagem is 926m, including levels 1 and 2. To date, there \n\nare (i) 301 drill holes in this orebody, including long holes drilled from the surface, old short \n\nholes, and holes drilled during underground development; (ii) 426 channels, (iii) more than \n\n12,700 samples with Au grade, and a substantial number of samples with S and As grades. \n\nSubsequently to the selection of samples from within the geologic model, a sub-set of 1,872 \n\nsamples was individualized and subjected to geostatistical evaluation. The same procedure of \n\nseparation of the anomalous samples located within the interpreted solids was used for each of the \n\nother orebodies, which were then subjected to evaluation studies. For the interpretation, a \n\nminimum of 1.6m of thickness and at least 2.5g/t of Au composited grade were used. Table 2 \n\nsummarizes the volume of information available to date for each orebody of the Lamego deposit. \n\nTable 2 \u2013 Summary of the exploration data available to the Lamego deposit. \n\n \n \n\nProject data related to channels and drill holes were centralized in an Oracle database and \n\nmanaged by the Fusion/Century system. The centralization of this information allows rapid, easy, \n\nsafe and reliable data insertion, editing and migration. The database contains information such as \n\nlithological and structural descriptions, geochemical analyses, densities, as well as additional \n\ninformation characterizing the drill holes in detail. \n\n\n\n104 \n\nIn order to ensure the validity and reliability of the estimation process, a strict quality \n\ncontrol is required, which enables the identification of possible irregularities in the grade and \n\ngeometry of the modeled orebodies. \n\n Figure 1 shows schematic views with drill holes, channels and wireframes of each \n\norebody.  \n\n \nFigure 1 \u2013 Schematic views with drill holes, channels and wireframes of each orebody. Different \n\nand random colours represent individual ore shoots.  \n\n 2.2 - QA/QC \n\nLamego project\u2019s Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) meet the \n\nrequirements of international standards. The samples are analyzed at the chemical laboratory of \n\nQueiroz Plant, and a duplicate is made at an external laboratory (SGS). A table summarizing the \n\nnumber of Lamego Project\u2019s samples used for QA/QC was prepared for the pre-feasibility study \n\n(Table 3).  \n\nDuring the process of sample preparation and grouping into batches to be sent to the \n\nlaboratory, standard samples and blank samples are inserted. For every ten rock samples, a \n\nstandard, high-grade sample is included together with a blank sample, or a standard low-grade \n\nsample. This serves to evaluate the laboratory and identify with more reliability the origin of \n\noccasional problems.  \n\nThe blank samples included in the batches serve to evaluate whether there was any \n\ncontamination during both the handling and the preparation of the material, any inversion or \n\n\n\n105 \n\nswapping of samples, as well as to evaluate the quality of the reagents, especially litharge (PbO), \n\nwhich can be contaminated with gold. \n\nThe standards used were provided by RockLAB, which holds an international certificate. \n\nThey were analyzed to measure the accuracy or inaccuracy of laboratories by comparing the \n\nresults from standards samples with different pre-established values between 1.8 g/t and 5.9 g/t. \n\nThe laboratory\u2019s performance considering this procedure is summarized in Table 3. The \n\ndistribution charts comprising the contents of standard and blank samples, with the respective \n\nstandard deviation limits, are presented in Figures 2 to 6.  \n\nTable 3 \u2013 QA/QC summary of the blanks and RockLAB standards - Lamego Project. \n\n \n\nContamination problems that usual occur include: (i) positive results in blank samples \n\nand/or; (ii) results from standard samples outside the standard deviation margins. When \n\ncontamination is suspected, after an attempt to identify its origin, a new set of analysis \n\ncomprising 20 samples, adjacent to the problematic sample, is performed.   \n\n \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Result of blank samples \u2013 QAQC \n\n\n\n106 \n\n \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Result of SI25 standard - 1.801g/t  - QAQC \n\n \n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Result of SJ10 standard - 2.643g/t \u2013 QAQC \n\n \n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Result of SL34 standard \u2013 5.893g/t \u2013 QAQC \n\n \n\nFigure 6 \u2013 Result of SL20 standard \u2013 5.911g/t \u2013 QAQC \n\n\n\n107 \n\nApproximately 850 core samples and 522 channel samples from all orebodies were \n\nselected and sent to an external laboratory (ALS Chemex) for cross-check analysis. A large \n\nportion of the core samples were taken within the limits of the modelled orebodies. They were \n\nsampled at random, without distinction of content, date, or any other criteria. Figure 7 shows \n\nscatter plots comprising the comparison of the results. It can be seen that the correlation index \n\nyielded from the comparison is within an acceptable limit (>85%).   \n\n  \n\nFigure 7 \u2013 Original vs re-analyzed data of the Lamego Project.  \n\n \n\n2.3 - Density Calculation \n\nA large portion of the core samples at Lamego has a density measurement calculated by \n\nthe immersion method. The average density for the orebodies varies as a result of different \n\naverage percentages of sulfide for each orebody. Their average densities are summarized in Table \n\n4.  \n\nTable 4 \u2013 Average densities of Lamego orebodies. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4 - Geological Modelling \n\nThe appropriate geological modeling of the geometry of orebodies is perhaps the most \n\nimportant step in the evaluation of a mineral deposit. During 3D geologic modelling, it is \n\nessential to respect geologic and structural concepts, as well as to consider the mining methods \n\nthat shall be used in ore extraction, so as to outclass the chemical results for the variable being \n\nanalyzed (in this case, gold). For the modeling of Lamego orebodies, an actual minimum \n\nthickness of 1.6m to 2.0m and grades of more than 2.5g/t in composite samples were used. \n\n\n\n108 \n\nTherefore, high-grade samples located in rocks such as carbonaceous schists and metandesites \u2013 \n\nthat is, outside the lithologic horizons regarded as rock to be mined (BIF and GQZ in Lamego\u2019s \n\ncase) \u2013 were excluded from the interpreted 3D solids.  \n\nStructural discontinuities, such as faults, folds and fractures observed both underground \n\nand at surface outcrops were charted and considered during geological modeling, as well as \n\nfoliation attitudes observed in drilling cores. This helped the interpretation in places with \n\ncomplex geometric connection of mineralized horizons, in sectors both orthogonal to and along \n\nthe plunge.  \n\nThe stratigraphic sequence was respected, so as not to mistakenly link a stratigraphic \n\nhorizon of the inverted limb to a mineralized horizon belonging to the normal limb, especially \n\nwhen these limbs are very close to each other (e.g., tracts of the Carruagem orebody). \n\nFigure 8 summarizes the workflow of the main procedures here employed. These include \n\nthe acquisition process, geological interpretation and modelling, evaluation and categorization of \n\nresources at the Lamego deposit.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n109 \n\n \nFigure 8 \u2013 Methodological workflow.  \n\n \n\n2.5 \u2013 GEOSTATISTICAL ESTIMATION   \n\nThe best estimator of a set of regionalized variables is not a simple, geometrically \n\nweighted mean of the sampled values, but rather a combination of the collected samples. Using \n\nthis approach, not only their relative position are considered, but also the spatial links underlying \n\nthe phenomenon, as well as values external to the zone that is to be estimated (Valente &amp; Girodo, \n\n1977). \n\n\n\n110 \n\nThe problem in finding the best possible linear estimator based on all available samples \n\nwas solved by Matheron (1962, 1963). Matheron`s krigging estimator is described in detail in \n\nsection 2.5.3.  \n\n2.5.1 - Lamego: Data Exploration \n\nStudy of averages \n\nHerein, the objective is to assess and control the values of the mean gold grades both \n\nbefore and after the composition of samples in regular lengths, and after the study of the capping, \n\nwhich are some of the steps that precede the estimation by ordinary kriging.  \n\nThe composition of samples in defined intervals contributes to the consistency of the \n\ndatabase and smoothes the shape of the frequency histogram. For the composition of samples \n\nfrom both the Carruagem orebody and the other orebodies, a length close to the mean of the \n\nlengths of the channels was adopted, and the different lithological types were respected. Figure 9 \n\nshows two frequency histograms of sample lengths prior to and after the composition. A \n\ncomposition length of 0.7m was adopted, and a maximum length of 1.05m and a minimum of \n\n0.4m were respected. For the Carruagem orebody, after the composite, the PDF (Probability \n\nDistribution Function) approximated a Gaussian distribution and the number of samples \n\nincreased from 1872 to 1900, as expected. \n\n  \nFigure 9 \u2013 Length sample histograms before and after composite of the Carruagem orebody. The \n\nnumber of sample increased from 1872 to 1900 (increase of 1.5%) after the composition.   \n\nThe behavior of the mean values of gold and sulfur grades also changed after the \n\ncomposition process. Figure 10 shows the behavior of the means and the frequency histograms \n\nfor gold at Lamego orebodies, both prior to and after composite and capping. A slight decrease in \n\nmean grades is noted in all orebodies. In the Carruagem orebody, however, the decrease in the \n\n\n\n111 \n\nmean grade after capping was more significant. This is due to the existence of a large number of \n\nsamples with values greater than 55g/t, and to the strong nugget effect caused by the occurrence \n\nof native gold in the rocks that form this orebody. After composite, the Au sample mean grows up \n\nfrom 9.08g/t to 9.35 g/t, but the difference is close to 3.0%. The PDF after composite becomes \n\nmuch more symmetric.  \n\nThe main reason to study the means, prior to and after each one of the processes involved \n\nin the evaluation, is to identify possible, significant changes in values that may indicate some \n\nproblem in a particular procedure, and consequently, may mislead the estimation of the deposit.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n112 \n\n \nFigure 10 \u2013 Behavior of the means and the frequency histograms for gold at Lamego orebodies, \n\nboth prior to and after each procedure employed to the evaluation of the deposit.  \n\nBi-variate Method \n\nFor the bi-variate study, scatterplots of all orebodies were generated to determine the \n\ncomparative behavior of gold and sulfur grades, since gold occurs associated essentially with \n\npyrite. The correlation factor varies from one orebody to another. The Carruagem orebody has a \n\nvery low factor (0.22), which means that the scattering of the samples indicates a highly random \n\nbehavior. This may be explained as being due to the strong nugget effect, which was also \n\nconfirmed in the variograms produced for this orebody. Carruagem has a particular high grade of \n\n\n\n113 \n\nnative (free) gold, mainly in the gray quartz veins, posing difficulties for the visual control during \n\nunderground development, which is guided by high sulfur concentrations and, in this case, can be \n\ncomplex. \n\nFigure 11 shows Au vs S scatterplots for the Lamego orebodies. The orebody with the \n\nhighest correlation index is Queimada. This shows close Au and S mean values and a correlation \n\nindex greater than 50%, corroborating the macroscopic aspects of the ore that eventually can \n\nreach more than 30% of sulfide. \n\n \nFigure 11 \u2013 Au vs S scatters plots. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Cabe\u00e7a de Pedra orebody also displays a correlation index close to 50%. However, \n\ngold grades here are lower. The Au mean value is about half the mean value of S grades. \n\n \n\n\n\n114 \n\nCapping Definition \n\nCumulative-probability logarithmic and arithmetic plots help defining cut-off grades for the \n\nhighest values of the population, which may be associated with the nugget effect or merely with \n\nlocal gold-enrichment phenomena. The reduction from the highest grade values to the upper cut-off \n\nlimit provided by the probability plots helps obtaining a more continuous population and creating a \n\nmore reliable system for estimation and simulation, in addition to eliminating possible \n\noverestimation during the evaluation of the mineral deposit. \n\nThe cumulative-probability arithmetic plots show the beginning of the discontinuity at \n\nlower values of gold grades, as compared to the logarithmic plots (Figure 12). Although in the \n\narithmetic plots it is possible to reduce the grade curves to continuously increasing values that are \n\ncloser to the values defined by the capping, the limits at the very beginning of the discontinuity \n\nwere used, which reflects a more conservative approach. Figure 12 shows the probability plots for \n\nthe Lamego orebodies. For the Carruagem orebody, the capping in the probability arithmetic plot \n\nshows the beginning of the discontinuity at 55g/t. The logarithmic plots show a discontinuity close \n\nto the 105g/t grade, which is considered too high, also taking into account the sensitivity of the \n\ngeology of this deposit orebodies. For the Arco da Velha and Cabe\u00e7a de Pedra orebodies, the \n\ncapping difference between the different plots was not so substantial (from 40g/t to 35 g/t in AV, \n\nand from 35 g/t to 23 g/t in CP), as compared to those for the Carruagem and Queimada, where the \n\nvalues were almost halved. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n115 \n\n \nFigure 12 \u2013 Capping definition for Au values using logarithmic and arithmetic probability plots. \n\nThe arithmetic plots show lower values of capping than logarithmic plots, with differences much \n\nmore expressive in the Carruagem and Queimada orebodies. For estimation, the arithmetic plots \n\nwere employed, which are more conservative.  \n\n \n\n\n\n116 \n\n2.5.2 - Variography \u2013 Variogram Fitting and Analysis \n\nIn a geometric field, consider two points, x and x+h, where h is a vector. The variogram \n\n2?(h) is the mathematical expectancy of the square of the increments of the  regionalized variable \n\nin the direction defined by vector h. In other words, the variogram 2?(h) is the average square of \n\nthe differences between all the existing pairs of points in the geometric field, spaced apart by the \n\ndistance h (Valente &amp; Girodo, 1977). It can be represented by the equation (Deutsch &amp; Journel, \n\n1998):  \n\n2?(h) = E{[Z(u) \u2013 Z(u+h)]\n2\n}. \n\nTraditionally, variograms, rather than the covariance, have been used in spatial variability \n\nmodelling, although kriging systems are more easily solved with covariance matrices (Deutsch &amp; \n\nJournel, 1998). \n\nNugget effect definition \u2013 Omni-directional variography \n\nIn the variography carried out for Lamego orebodies, initially the variability was obtained \n\nfor short distances, since they provide an important parameter for the fitting of the variograms \n\nand for defining gold-grade variability. The nugget effect is obtained considering either the \n\nsmallest scale of the deposit or the variability for each sample interval, and calculating the \n\nvariograms based on the composite data, in view of the length of the composite samples and the \n\ncapping of each orebody. Figure 13 shows the Omni-directional variograms for Lamego \n\norebodies.  \n\n\n\n117 \n\n \nFigure 13 \u2013 Gold - Omni-directional variograms and definition of nugget effect. \n\n \n\nDirectional Variography \n\nThe directional variograms were calculated to determine the spatial variability of gold \n\ngrade. They were based on the directions and dips of the geologic models that pre-indicated the \n\nanisotropy of the mineralized bodies. No spatial tools were used in defining the preferred \n\ndirections of such possible anisotropies. That is, with the opening of the most part of the two \n\nlevels, which are vertically spaced 50m apart, a substantial confidence level was obtained for the \n\ndirections and dips of the orebody plunges. \n\nFigure 14 summarizes the directional variograms for Lamego orebodies that represents the \n\nmain direction of the mineralization. It is noted that along directions sub-parallel to the strike \n\n(Direction 2) or to the development of the orebodies, the variograms are more continuous than \n\nalong plunge directions, where the amount of information is relatively reduced. All the \n\nvariograms were standardized for a sill equals to one. \n\n\n\n118 \n\n \nFigure 14 \u2013 Directional variograms for Lamego orebodies. \n\n \n\n2.5.3 - Estimation by Ordinary Kriging \n\nConcepts  \n\nKriging is \u201ca collection of generalized linear regression techniques for minimizing an \n\nestimated variance defined from a prior covariance model\u201d (Olea, 1991 in Deutsch, 1998). All \n\nversions of kriging are elaborated on the basis of a linear regression algorithm and a \n\ncorresponding estimator, so that: \n\n\n\n119 \n\n \n\n                   n \n\n[Z\n*\n\nSK(u)-m(u)]  =  ?  ??(u) [Z(u?) \u2013 m(u?)], \n\n                  ?=1 \n\nwhere Z(u) is the RV (Random Variable) model at location u; u?\u00b4s are the n data locations; m(u) \n\n= E{Z(u)} is the location-dependent expected value of RV Z(u); and Z\n*\nSK(u) is the linear \n\nregression estimator, also called Simple Kriging  (SK) estimator.  \n\nConsidering a non-sampled value z(u0) to be estimated from surrounding data with known \n\nvalues z(u), ?=1,...,n, then the RF (Random Function) model Z(u) is stationary, with mean value \n\nm and covariance C(h). In this simple version, also known as Simple Kriging (SK), the algorithms \n\nconsider the linear estimator as  \n\n                        n                            n                                                                 \n\n                 Z\n*\nSK(u0)  =  ?  ??(u)Z(u?) + [1- ?  ??(u)]m. \n\n            ?=1                       ?=1 \n\nThe weights ??(u) are determined for minimizing the error variance, and are also called \n\nestimation variance. This minimization results in a series of normal equations:  \n\n       n \n\n       ? ??(u)C(u? - u?) = C(u - u?), for ? = 1,..., n. \n\n      ?=1 \n\nThe corresponding minimized estimation variance, or kriging variance, is      \n                                                   n \n\n      ?\n2\nSK (u) = C(0) - ? ?? (u)C(u - u?) ? 0. \n\n                               ?=1 \n\nSimple Kriging is usually preceeded by Ordinary Kriging (OK), where the sum of the \n\nweights ?\nn\n\n?=1 ??(u) is constrained to sum up to 1. This establishes an estimator Z*OK(u) that does \n\nnot require prior knowledge of the stationary mean m, and therefore it can be said that \n\nE[Z*OK(u)]=E[Z(u)] and results in the following Ordinary Kriging estimator:      \n\n                                                                  n                           \n\n                                                 Z*OK(u0) = ???\n(OK)\n\n(u) Z(u?) \n\n                                                                 ?=1 \n\n \n\nTherefore, the ordinary kriging estimator is a type of simple kriging estimator where the \n\nconstant value of the mean is replaced by the dependent estimator m*(u): \n\n                                                 n                               n \n\n                                 Z*OK(u) = ???\n(SK)\n\n(u)Z(u?) +  [1- ???\n(SK)\n\n(u)]m*(u) \n\n                                                ?=1                           ?=1 \n\nwhere ??\n(OK) \n\n are the ordinary kriging weights and ??\n(SK) \n\n are the simple kriging weights. \n\n\n\n120 \n\nOrdinary kriging is regarded as a non-stationary algorithm that uses data from moving \n\nneighborhoods, corresponding to a non-stationary RF model with varying means and stationary \n\ncovariance. This ability to re-scale Z(u) locally in the RF model for different values of the mean \n\nm*(u) explains the extreme robustness of the ordinary kriging algorithm. Ordinary kriging has \n\nbeen a consistent anchor in Geoestatistics (Deutsch &amp; Journel, 1998).  \n\nOrdinary Kriging for Lamego Orebodies \n\nThe ordinary kriging was carried out separately for each of the Lamego orebodies. It was \n\nbased on drill holes and channels together, both considering the same support of sampling in \n\nterms of length and weight. The purpose was to generate block models to fill the solids \n\nconstructed by 3D geological modelling, with estimated gold grades. The strategy was to provide \n\na consistent mechanism for geostatistical evaluation, making it possible to obtain the approximate \n\ntotal metal content of the deposit.  \n\nPrior to using the ordinary kriging algorithms, a set of procedures was followed, \n\nincluding:  \n\n(i) generation of a reference ellipse, to obtain a 3D visualization between the geometry of the \n\norebodies and that of the ellipse, with the dimensions and directions of the x, y and z axis \n\ncoherent with the main 3D elongations of the geological model (Figure 15);  \n\n \nFigure 15 \u2013 Example of reference ellipse with different angles and sizes in the xyz axes - Arco da \n\nVelha orebody (random colors). \n\n \n\n(ii) creation of empty block models (prototypes) that host no information and are sufficiently \n\nlarge to contain all the wireframes of each orebody (Figure 16);  \n\n \n\n\n\n121 \n\n \nFigure 16 \u2013 Prototype models (grey blocks).  \n\n \n\n(iii) Preliminary definition of block sizes by analyzing the smoothness of the diagram involving \n\n\u201cblock size versus kriging variance\u201d. The curve is generated by creating blocks of different sizes \n\nand with the same center coordinate, plus calculating the kriging variance for each of the blocks. \n\nThe variance values begin to stabilize close to 0.12, which corresponds to a block size or SMU \n\n(Selective Mining Unit) of 10m (Figure 17). The blocks with different sizes were calculated \n\nbased on the same group of samples.  \n\n \n\n\n\n122 \n\n \nFigure 17 \u2013 Block size definition - kriging variance vs block size.  \n\n \n\n(iv) separation of samples and blocks that are above and below the oxidation surface. Blocks \n\nlocated below this surface correspond to sulfidized ore, whereas those located above correspond \n\nto oxidized ore. The oxidation surface was generated by 3D interpolation of points that \n\ncorresponds to changes in the degree of weathering. In the drilling cores this points mark the \n\nlimits between fresh rocks and rocks that show some degree of alteration;  \n\n(v) definition of variables, estimation parameters, input/output files, capping values for each of \n\nthe orebodies, estimation method, parameters of the modeled variograms, dimensions and \n\ndirections of the ellipses, including search volumes, etc.  \n\nThe search volumetric ellipsoids are used to assist in the interpolation of grades. These \n\nvolumes are defined based on the parameters obtained in the variographic modelling, by \n\nassociating them with the maximum distances to the ellipsoid axes. The results are also affected \n\nby: (i) maximum and minimum number of samples considered for estimating each block; (ii) \n\nsubdivision of search volumes into regular sectors, providing a better definition on the anisotropy \n\ncontrol; and (iii) minimum requirements within sectors for the estimation.  Figure 18 shows an \n\nexample of the Datamine parameter file used in the ordinary kriging of the Carruagem orebody, \n\nwith the respective parameters used in the search volume. The search strategy employed, \n\nsummarized herein, includes the following rules: (i) division of the ellipsoid into 8 sectors \n\n(octants); (ii) use of a minimum of 2 sectors or octants for each estimated block; (iii) use of a \n\nminimum of 5 samples for each estimated block; (iv) use of a maximum of 24 samples per block \n\n\n\n123 \n\n(to avoid significant grade smoothing); (v) use of samples within each of the wireframes related \n\nto the small mineralized horizons of the orebodies only. \n\nThe search ellipsoids were scaled up in multiple phases. The scale of the search volume \n\nwas gradually increased by multiples of the original input values \u2013 that is, multiples of the \n\nmaximum distance for each of the directions considered for the range of the variograms. Blocks \n\nthat were not estimated during the first pass were only estimated after increasing factors of 2x and \n\n3x in successive passes, until all blocks were estimated with an increase of 5x the maximum \n\ndistance of the ranges. With this approach, more than 80% of the blocks were estimated, \n\nconsidering a maximum search volume equals to 3x the distance of the range along the plunge, \n\nand constantly respecting the geological correlation of Au within all mineralized lenses. Figure 34 \n\npresents the results of the variographic study for the Carruagem orebody, including parameters \n\nsuch as anisotropy angles, structures and variogram models in three directions used in the \n\nordinary kriging of this orebody.  \n\n  \nFigure 18 \u2013 Parameters for the search volume (left) and variogram model (right) - Carruagem \n\norebody.  \n\n \n\nBefore definitely assigning the results of the ordinary kriging, a set of validations of the \n\nblock models is required, as well as a review of the conditional expectation. \n\nOrdinary Kriging Validation \n\n \n\nThe main procedures for kriging validation are summarized as follows: \n\n1. Visual examination, using only the result of the first search of the ellipse (Figure \n\n19A) . The values of the estimated blocks are compared to those of the composite \n\nsamples; \n\n\n\n124 \n\n2. Visual comparative check considering the second and third searches (Figure 19B \n\nand C); \n\n3. Identification of those blocks that remain non-estimated after all the searches and, \n\nif necessary, manual fitting of these blocks by means of filling in appropriate \n\nvalues (knowledge driven); \n\n4. Merge of the block models estimated in the volumetric searches with the \n\nmanually-stamped block models; \n\n5. Final visual check of the block models combined with the composite samples; \n\n6. Stationary analysis, by comparing average Au grades in horizontal volumetric \n\nslices (obtained separately from the database) with the composite samples and the \n\nestimated block models (i.e., analysis of support change); \n\n7. Final analysis of the swath plots and, if necessary, adjustment of the incoherent \n\nresults obtained throughout the process.  \n\n \nFigure 19 \u2013 Validation of kriging results for each search volume of the Carruagem orebody: A - \n\nprimary check, using the first search ellipse (80m, 20m, 11m); B \u2013 second visual check with 2\nnd\n\n \n\nsearch ellipse  (160m, 40m, 22m); C \u2013 third visual check with 3\nrd\n\n search ellipse (240m, 60m, \n\n11m); D \u2013check with n\nrd\n\n search ellipse. \n\n \n\nThe ordinary kriging validation steps described above were repeated for all other \n\norebodies of the Lamego deposit.  \n\n\n\n125 \n\nStationary Analysis  \n\nThe ordinary kriging validation is based on comparing the mean values obtained in the \n\nestimated block models with the mean values of the declustered samples divided into volumetric \n\nslices spaced horizontally 50m apart (Figure 20A) and vertically 25m apart (Figure 20B). The \n\nvolumetric means of the estimated blocks were weighted according to their tonnage, whereas the \n\nvolumetric means of the samples were weighted according to the declustered weights.  \n\n \nFigure 20A \u2013 Example of horizontal volume slices (50m) of the Arco da Velha orebody (random \n\ncolors). \n\n  \n\n \nFigure 20B \u2013 Example of vertical volume slices (25m) of the Arco da Velha orebody. \n\n \n\nIn general, the curves of the horizontal volumetric slices of estimated blocks are close to \n\nthe points of declustered samples (Figure 21). Slightly lower mean values occur especially where \n\nthere is a larger number of samples (along levels 1 and 2 in all orebodies). At levels with a \n\nsmaller number of samples, the differences between block and sample means are greater, and the \n\nresults of the blocks tend to approximate the overall mean of each orebody. At the Carruagem and \n\n\n\n126 \n\nArco da Velha orebodies, a slight decrease in gold-grade at depth is observed. This phenomenon, \n\nhowever, may be associated with the lack of information about these places. The proximity of the \n\ntwo curves indicates that the parameters of the search ellipsoids as well as the variographic and \n\nordinary-kriging parameters were properly obtained. \n\n \nFigure 21 \u2013 Kriging validation. Graphical relationship between mean estimated blocks and \n\ndeclustered mean sample of the horizontal volume slices. Slices are displaced at 50m apart in \n\ndepth. \n\n \n\nIn the vertical volume slices generated every 25 meters from South to North (Figure 22) \n\nshowed a slight regionalized gold-grade increase in the northern portions of almost all orebodies. \n\nThis phenomenon is more significant in the Carruagem and Arco da Velha orebodies. It may be \n\nassociated with local geologic discontinuities or to the direction of the regional deformation, \n\nwhich would be responsible for the concentration of richer zones at these sectors. The curves of \n\nthe vertical volumetric slices remained close to each other, confirming the proper configuration of \n\nthe ordinary kriging parameters for the deposit. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n127 \n\n \nFigure 22 \u2013 Kriging validation. Graphical relationship between mean estimated blocks and \n\ndeclustered average sample of the vertical volume slices. Slices are 25m apart from south to \n\nnorth. \n\n \n\nAfter completion of the ordinary kriging validation, external wireframes of all orebodies \n\nwere generated, and a kriging estimation of this external envelope was made. For this estimation, \n\nonly samples not belonging to the geological model were included \u2013 that is, samples external to \n\nthe model in a radius of about 5m.  The conception of a block model in the neighborhood with \n\nlow grades allows these values to be taken into account in further calculations of the grade \n\ndilution.  Figure 23 shows a sector of level 2 in the Carruagem orebody. External blocks are \n\nshown in blue and were estimated separately. The mean for these blocks is close to 0.47g/t. This \n\nprocedure also makes it possible the selection of where the dilution shall be performed, either in \n\nthe hanging wall or in the footwall, depending which grade of the envelope is higher.   \n\n  \nFigure 23 \u2013 Carruagem orebody at level 2 \u2013 horizontal slices with and without outside dilution \n\narea.  \n\n\n\n128 \n\nThe ordinary kriging results for all the orebodies are shown in Figure 24.  \n\n \nFigure 24 \u2013 Concluding block models of all orebodies.  \n\n \n\nFigure 25 shows the volume of estimated geological resources at Lamego over the last 5 \n\nyears. It can be noted that although the total of resources shows differences not greater than 20%, \n\nthe change in the classification of the resources was quite substantial, primarily with regard to \n\nmeasured resources.  \n\n \n\n\n\n129 \n\n \nFigure 25 \u2013 Evolution of Lamego geological resources since 2004.  \n\n \n\n2.6 - Grade-Tonnage Curve  \n\nThe grade-tonnage curve of the Lamego deposit, shown in Figure 26, was constructed \n\nconsidering all orebodies.  \n\n \nFigure 26 \u2013 Grade-tonnage curve of the Lamego deposit. \n\n\n\n130 \n\n2.7 - Mineral Resources Classification  \n\nThe Sequential Gaussian Simulation (sgsim.exe algorithm) was used in this work to assist \n\nthe classification of the mineral resources of the Lamego deposit and to define the uncertainty \n\nassociated to such classification.  \n\n \n\nSimulation Concepts  \n\nThe simple kriging system (SK) can be understood as the condition to identify the \n\ncovariance of  Z*SK(u) with any of the n data Z(u?) to the covariance model. In this sense, SK is \n\nthe first step towards simulation, which is the process of reproducing a covariance model. But SK \n\nis rather incomplete in that the covariance between any two SK estimators Z*SK(u) and Z*SK(u\u2019) \n\nat two different locations u ? u\u2019 is incapable to identify the model value C(u\u2013u\u2019). Sequential \n\nsimulation is able to add the value Z*SK(u), corrected for its smoothing, into the dataset used at \n\nsubsequent nodes u\u2019 (Journel, 1993; apud Deutsch, 1998).  \n\nConditional simulation was initially developed to correct for the smoothing effect shown \n\non maps produced by the kriging algorithm. Indeed, kriging estimates are weighted moving \n\naverages of the original data values; thus they have less spatial variability than the data. \n\nMoreover, depending on the data configuration, the degree of smoothing varies in space, entailing \n\npossibly artefact structures. Typical conditional simulation algorithms trade the estimation \n\nvariance minimization for the reproduction of a variogram/covariance seen as a model of spatial \n\nvariability. A smoothed map, as provided by kriging, is appropriate for showing global trends. On \n\nthe other hand, conditionally simulated maps are more appropriate for studies that are sensitive to \n\npatterns of local variability such as flow simulations (Hewett, 1986; Journel &amp; Alabert, 1990; \n\napud Deutsch, 1998). A suite of conditionally simulated maps also provides a measure (model) of \n\nuncertainty about the attribute(s) spatial distribution. \n\nA set of L realizations from any specific simulation algorithm (in this case, the Sequential \n\nGaussian Simulation algorithm) can be used to determine probabilities of occurrence of specific \n\nfunctions of these realizations only if the L realizations are \u201cequiprobable\u201d - that is if any of the L \n\nrealizations has the same probability to be drawn as any other among L. Such equiprobability is \n\nachieved if each realization can be identified to a single random number (the realization seed \n\nnumber) uniformly distributed in [0,1] \u2013 in other words, if each realization can be reproduced \n\nexactly by re-running the simulations algorithm using its seed number. Naturally, equiprobability \n\nrefers to a specific simulation model including its RF model (if any), all parameter values, the \n\n\n\n131 \n\nimplementation algorithm and a computer code. In case another simulation model or another \n\nimplementation of the same RF model is used, it generates a different set of realizations, leading \n\nto different probability assessments (Journel, 1994, 1996; apud Deutsch, 1998). \n\nSequential Gaussian Simulation (SGSIM) \n\n The most straightforward algorithm for generating realizations of a multivariate Gaussian \n\nfiled is provided by the sequential principle. Each variable is simulated sequentially according to \n\nits normal Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF), which is fully characterized through a SK \n\nsystem. The conditioning data consists of all original data and all previously simulated values \n\nfound within a neighborhood of the location being simulated. \n\n According to the H. Zhu &amp; Journel, 1993; in Deutsch, 1998, the conditional simulation of \n\na continuous variable z((u)  modelled by a Gaussian-related stationary RF Z(u) is implemented as \n\nfollows: \n\n1. Determine the univariate CDF Fz(z) representative of the entire study area and not only the z \n\nsample data available. Declustering may be needed if the z data are preferentially located; \n\n2. Using the CDF Fz(z), perform the normal score transform of z data into y data with a standard \n\nnormal CDF;  \n\n3. Check for bivariate normality of the normal score y data. If the multivariate Gaussian model \n\ncannot be retained, then consider alternative models such as mixture of Gaussian populations or \n\nan indicator-based algorithm for the stochastic simulation. \n\n4. If a multivariate Gaussian RF model can be adopted for the y variable, proceed with program \n\nsgsim.exe and sequential simulation, i.e., \n\n Define a random path that visits each node of the grid once. At each node u, retain a \n\nspecified number of neighboring conditioning data including both original y data and \n\npreviously simulated grid node y values; \n\n Use SK with the normal score variogram model to determine the parameters (mean and \n\nvariance) of the CDF of the RF Y(u) at location u.  \n\n Draw a simulated value y\n(1)\n\n (u) from that CDF \n\n Add the simulated value y\n(1)\n\n (u) to the data set.  \n\n Proceed to the next node, and loop until all nodes are simulated. \n\n5. Backtransform the simulated normal values {y\n(1)\n\n (u), u ? A} into simulated values for the \n\noriginal variable. \n\n\n\n132 \n\nClassification of Mineral Resources at the Lamego Deposit \n\nThe classification of mineral resources at the Lamego deposit uses the definitions from \n\nJORC (Australasian Joint Ore Reserves Committee), which classifies the mineral resources into \n\nmeasured, indicated, or inferred categories, depending on the confidence level of the estimate. A \n\nschematic classification and the extension to reserves are illustrated in Figure 27.  \n\n \nFigure 27 \u2013 Classification of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves according to the JORC (2004). \n\n \n\nThe criteria for defining categories at the Lamego deposit were based on economic aspects \n\nassociated with the uncertainty of a geological unit for a given, pre-defined production scale. The \n\n15% uncertainty was used, where: \n\n Measured resources: mineral resources shall have a uncertainty no greater than \n\n15% with 90% confidence for a volumetric panel equivalent to a three-month \n\nproduction; \n\n Indicated resources: mineral resources shall have a uncertainty no greater than \n\n15% with 90% confidence for a volumetric panel equivalent to a twelve-month \n\nproduction;  \n\n Inferred resources: obtained by geological knowledge and common sense, with \n\nan uncertainty greater than 15% and with 90% confidence. \n\nFor calculations of uncertainty in panels relating to quarterly or annual periods, the \n\nmethodology commonly used is the Sequential Gaussian Simulation, which generates a \n\n\n\n133 \n\ndistribution of 100 possibilities or realizations of grades and thicknesses for each estimated SMU \n\n(Selective Mining Unit). SGSIM is used for accessing the uncertainties of the process related to \n\nthe evaluation of the deposit, as well as for generating probabilistic estimates of the parameters \n\nthat shall confirm the variability of the sampled populations. The spatial distribution resulting \n\nfrom the calculated values makes it possible to access the uncertainty.  \n\nIn this study, the statistical uncertainty was calculated for the gold content (in ounces) of \n\neach SMU by multiplying the tonnage uncertainty parameter (accessed by the thickness variance) \n\nby the grade variance, thereby obtaining the overall uncertainty expressed in gold ounces. Table 5 \n\nshows how the final uncertainty used in the classification of the resources at the Lamego deposit \n\nwas determined. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n134 \n\nTable 5 \u2013 Evolution of uncertainty calculated for quarterly periods considering 11 panels.   \n\n \n\nThe steps for the classification of the Lamego deposit resources are the following: (a) \n\nselection the most significant orebody in terms of grades and tonnage (metal content), which shall \n\nbe subjected to SGSIM; (b) rotation of the selected orebody to minimize the processing time \n\n(Figure 28); (c) data transformation to the Gaussian space (NSCORE); (d) simulation (SGSIM) of \n\n\n\n135 \n\nthe Au grade and thickness; (e) data back-transformation to the real space; (f) validation of the \n\nSGSIM; (g) measurement of the uncertainty per production unit; (h) assignment of the uncertainty \n\nand the category to the adjacent minor orebodies that show similar variability conditions and \n\nlevels of information (Figure 29); (i) reproduction of the calculated uncertainty back to the 3D \n\nmodel; (j) establishment of a knowledge-driven procedure to adjust the categorized panels.  \n\n  \n Figure 28 \u2013 3D-view comparing the two coordinate systems: before and after projection \n\n \n\n \n Figure 29 \u2013 Percentiles of orebodies 9 and 8 showing similar variability conditions.   \n\n \n\nPrior to accepting the result of the simulation as a tool to assist in the quantification of \n\nuncertainties, a comparative appraisal must be performed. This considers the results of the \n\noriginal samples mean and the mean of the values obtained by ordinary kriging estimation, \n\ntogether with the mean of the results from 100 realizations, yielded through the sequential \n\n\n\n136 \n\nsimulation (Figures 30 and 31). It is also necessary to compare the variogram models produced on \n\nthe basis of the original database with the variograms produced from the simulated results.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 30 \u2013 Au averages data vs kriging vs sequential simulation. Carruagem orebody. \n\nFigure 30 shows the average value for Au obtained from 100 realizations was slightly \n\nhigher than the mean value of the ordinary kriging estimate and slightly lower than the mean \n\nvalue of the samples that correspond to the declustered original database. Conversely, the average \n\nthickness resulting from the sequential simulation showed slightly higher values when compared \n\nwith the mean value of the actual thicknesses displayed by the 3D geological modelling (Figure \n\n31).  \n\n \nFigure 31 \u2013 Average thickness data vs sequential simulation. Carruagem orebody. \n\n \n\n\n\n137 \n\nFigures 32 and 33 show the variogram validation considering the simulations of gold \n\ngrades and thickness values of the Carruagem orebody.  In this validation, the models for the two \n\nmain directions of the ellipsoid are compared with the clouds yielded from the simulated \n\nrealizations (lines shown in gray). \n\n \nFigure 32 \u2013 Au simulation validation - simulated variograms (100 realizations) vs original \n\nvariograms. \n\n \nFigure 33 \u2013 Validation of simulated thickness-simulated variograms (100 realizations) vs original \n\nvariograms (blue and red). \n\n \n\n The clouds of the simulated variograms reproduced well the variographic information and \n\nwere significantly coherent with the original database - in the same manner that the average plots \n\nindicated a qualitatively acceptable validation. However, the uncertainty obtained with the \n\nsimulation of gold grades, conjugated with the variability of the thickness, show that there is no \n\nmeasured resource for the Carruagem orebody, considering such methodology. Although the \n\nuncertainty in the gold grade variability persisted under 15% in a group of production panels, \n\nthickness variability was quite significant, contributing for a total uncertainty greater than 15% in \n\nall panels related to a 3-month production, for a confidence interval of 90% (Figure 34A). The \n\n\n\n138 \n\nuncertainty obtained for annual production intervals (Figure 34B) considering the upper panel, \n\nwhich contains information from level 1 (practically fully developed), did not exceed 13%. In the \n\nintermediate panel, which contains part of level 2 (under development), the variability remained \n\nat about 15%. Therefore, these two panels can be characterized as indicated resource.  \n\n \nFigure 34 \u2013 Uncertainties resulting from the simulation process for 3-months (A) and annual (B) \n\nproduction panels. Carruagem orebody.  \n\n \n\nThe summarized resource classification for the Carrruagem orebody is shown in Figure \n\n35. In Figure 35A, the classification takes into account a confidence interval of 90% (according to \n\nthe 15% uncertainty). Note that there are only indicated and inferred resources, as the minimum \n\nuncertainty was of about 17%. The lower limits of the indicated resources was defined by the \n\npanel related to the annual production, with uncertainty equal to and lower than 15%.  \n\nAllowing for a less stringent confidence interval of 80% (Figure 35B), two panels of \n\nmeasured resources are positioned between levels 1 and 2, and a significant part above level 1.  \n\n \nFigure 35 \u2013 Classification of the Carruagem orebody and uncertainties yielded through the \n\nsimulation process. A \u2013 90% confidence; B \u2013 80% confidence; C \u2013 knowledge-driven inference.  \n\n\n\n139 \n\n \n\n The conditional simulation process \u2013 which considers the uncertainties obtained in the \n\nrealizations for the variables gold and thickness (tonnage) \u2013 was insufficient to characterize \n\nmeasured resources at the Carruagem orebody. However, two 20m panels, each of which 10m \n\nabove and below levels 1 and 2, respectively (Figure 35C), were considered to be measured \n\nresources, based on underground geological knowledge. Also, the following constraints were \n\ndefined for indicated resources: i) above 820m, where the geotechnical characteristics indicate \n\nuncertainties concerning geomechanical instabilities, due to the proximity of the oxidation \n\nsurface; and  ii) below 590m, where only two drill holes support a panel of more than 200m along \n\nthe strike. The orebodies to the south are at a distance sufficiently large to warrant a more \n\naccurate financial evaluation to ascertain the economics, and thus are considered as part of the \n\ninferred resources.  \n\nAnother important aspect to consider is that the spacing of drill holes made from the \n\nunderground drilling district (i.e, that spans a panel of more than 70m below level 2 and was \n\nperformed with a spacing of approximately 25m along the plunge and 25m along the strike), was \n\ninsufficient to classify the resource in this panel as measured resource. Therefore, further drilling \n\ncampaigns should consider a closer spaced grid \u2013 for example, 10m along the strike and 20m \n\nalong the plunge.  \n\nThis same resource classification method was used for the other orebodies of the Lamego \n\ndeposit. Figure 36 shows, in an integrated manner, the resource classification for the other \n\norebodies \u2013 Arco da Velha, Cabe\u00e7a de Pedra, Queimada, and Alvo NE \u2013 as well as for the \n\nCarruagem orebody detailed above.  \n\n\n\n140 \n\n \nFigure 36 \u2013 Lamego orebodies \u2013 3D classification of geological resources. \n\n \n\nFigure 37 shows the classification of resources at the Lamego deposit from \n\nDecember/2004 to June/2008.  Note that a change in the classification methodology, particularly \n\nin 2008, had a significant impact on the categorization. Nevertheless, the complex geometry of \n\nthe orebodies was in fact the main cause of reduction among measured and indicated resources \n\nover time. Such complexity was only revealed lately, after the opening of the levels and \n\ndensification of the grid spacing between drill holes.  \n\n \nFigure 37 \u2013 Classification of resources at the Lamego deposit between 2004-2008.  \n\n\n\n141 \n\n \n\nFigure 38 shows an illustration of the annual progressive conversion of geological \n\nresources into mineable resources planned for the Lamego deposit. The increasing evolution of \n\nmeasured and indicated resources is proportional to the underground development and the \n\nperiodical drilling campaign, including surface and underground drill holes. In each panel of 50m \n\nthick is input the amount of geological and mineable resources. Only the measured plus indicated \n\ngeological resources are considered during the conversion into mineable resources; in addition, \n\nvertical sustentation pillars and shallow safety crown pillars with residual gold ore must be \n\nsubtracted of the mineable resources, getting thus the final number of reserves. Exceptionally in \n\nArco da Velha orebody, only the mineralized material above the level 3 was considered in life of \n\nmine at this moment.  \n\n \nFigure 38 \u2013 Simplified conversion resources program planned for the Lamego deposit.  \n\n\n\n142 \n\n3 \u2013 CONCLUSIONS \n\nAll geostatistical procedures applied on this work were very useful to support the \n\nestimation of the metallic content of the Lamego gold deposit.  Also, they supported the \n\ncategorization of the mineral resources and in the improvement of the geological knowledge of \n\nthe orebodies.  \n\nThe study of average gold values, which preceded the ordinary kriging estimation, proved \n\nimportant as to reinforce the care needed during the execution of each evaluation phase of a \n\nmineral deposit. For this purpose, the analysis of the frequency histograms of the regional \n\nvariables was also relevant in assisting the quantification and identification of the unexpected \n\nvariations. \n\nAn eventual inadequate tree dimensional geological modelling of the orebodies can result \n\nin serious inaccuracy during the evaluation of any mineral deposit, because the geometry is \n\nstrongly related to tonnage. Therefore, genetic issues, such as structural and stratigraphic criteria, \n\nmust be considered during 3D modelling. Mainly in gold deposits, attention to dilution should be \n\nintensified. The lack of accuracy in sample location inside or outside the modeled orebody can \n\nlead to underestimated or overestimated results. Also, field demarcation of the mining areas must \n\nbe rigorous in terms of topographic precision and follow the modeling of 3D limits for this type \n\nof gold deposits that have narrow and sufficiently varied thickness. \n\nAmong other studies, the bi-variant study of Au and S (scatter plots) was probably the \n\nmost significant to define the guide reefs of the Lamego deposit. The correlation factors vary for \n\ndifferent orebodies. For example, this factor is much lower for the Carruagem orebody (0.22) if \n\ncompared with the others, implying that there is a population with high gold and low sulfur \n\ngrades. At these sites, gold is frequently associated to micro-fractures and occurs as free gold. \n\nThis type of occurrence can also be recognized in the directional correlograms typified by their \n\nhigh nugget effect. The Carruagem and Arco da Velha orebodies particularly show a high free \n\ngold content mainly in the gray quartz veins host rock, which makes difficult the visual control \n\nduring underground development galleries since they are usually guided by high sulfide contents. \n\nThe Queimada is the orebody with the highest Au and S correlation index (above 50%). This \n\nfeature matches the visually observed high sulfide content at this orebody, which can reach over \n\n30% of sulfides. The Cabe\u00e7a de Pedra orebody exhibits an Au and S correlation index close to \n\n0.5, but contains exceptionally lower gold grades. The latter are examples that sulfide content can \n\n\n\n143 \n\nbe considered as a guide during the underground development operations, although there are \n\nexceptions, as is the case verified at the Carruagem orebody.   \n\nThe validation results of ordinary kriging estimation performed on Lamego orebodies \n\nconfirmed that the correlograms and search ellipsoids parameters were coherently adjusted to \n\neach other, proving this to be a trustworthy evaluation method. Kriging validation procedures also \n\nallowed a few conclusions that, although yet preliminary, can assist in developing a strategy to \n\nenhance the time span of the Lamego mine. For instance, the mean gold distribution of the \n\nhorizontal volumetric panels indicates that gold grades are lower with increasing depth both in \n\nthe Carruagem and Arco da Velha orebodies. Considering the few samples taken in deeper levels, \n\nthis interpretation cannot be conclusive, but the data indicates such tendency. Conversely, the \n\nmean gold distribution of the vertical volumetric panels indicates that gold grades slightly \n\nincrease following the North direction. This feature can be associated to deformation episodes \n\n(that are coincident to the mineralizing hydrothermal fluid accumulation at those sites) and/or to \n\nstructural traps in the northern sectors of the aforementioned orebodies. \n\nSequential Gaussian Simulation process was performed through 100 realizations of the \n\nvariables. The results were useful to quantify the variability and so, to predict the uncertainty of \n\nproduction in panels related to quarters or annual periods. SGSIM results took in account the \n\nuncertainty for both the gold and thickness (tonnage) variables. The high uncertainty result has \n\nshown that measured resources in the Carruagem orebody could not be classified as such, \n\nconsidering a 90% trustworthy interval. However, considering the geological knowledge gathered \n\nfrom underground mapping and drilling core logs in the analysis, two panels of 20 meters (10 \n\nmeters above and below levels 1 and 2) could be conclusively classified as measured resources. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n144 \n\n\n\n145 \n\nCAP\u00cdTULO 3 \n\nCONCLUS\u00d5ES FINAIS E PRINCIPAIS CONTRIBUI\u00c7\u00d5ES \n\n \n\nAcredita-se que os resultados do desenvolvimento desta pesquisa forneceram um razo\u00e1vel \n\nincremento no conhecimento geol\u00f3gico do deposito Lamego e dos alvos sat\u00e9lites estudados. As \n\nabordagens geol\u00f3gicas, geof\u00edsicas, geoestat\u00edsticas e metodol\u00f3gicas desenvolvidas nesta tese \n\ndemonstram a import\u00e2ncia da integra\u00e7\u00e3o de dados multi-fonte, quando se procura compreender e \n\ndesvendar as complexidades inerentes \u00e0 geologia de dep\u00f3sitos aur\u00edferos. A busca incessante pela \n\nlocaliza\u00e7\u00e3o de novos corpos mineralizados em pesquisas explorat\u00f3rias para diversas subst\u00e2ncias \n\nminerais, vem gerando uma tend\u00eancia ascendente no avan\u00e7o das tecnologias aplicadas \u00e0s ci\u00eancias \n\nda terra, que devem ser cada vez mais exploradas e plicadas em estudos geol\u00f3gicos. \n\nA complexidade da mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o aur\u00edfera no dep\u00f3sito Lamego, atribu\u00edda principalmente \n\naos controles estruturais, varia\u00e7\u00f5es expressivas na geometria e espessura dos corpos estudados, \n\naus\u00eancia de guia estratigr\u00e1fico bem definido dos horizontes mineralizados e principalmente a \n\nbaixa correla\u00e7\u00e3o dos teores de ouro com os \u00edndices de sulfeta\u00e7\u00e3o, dificultam consideravelmente o \n\ndesenvolvimento e abertura das galerias subterr\u00e2neas. Essa complexidade foi comprovada ap\u00f3s a \n\nabertura e mapeamento geol\u00f3gico do segundo n\u00edvel. As dire\u00e7\u00f5es e mergulhos dos bols\u00f5es \n\nmineralizados apresentaram boa correla\u00e7\u00e3o com as medidas de linea\u00e7\u00f5es minerais; por outro lado \n\nos n\u00edveis mineralizados raramente se associam a um horizonte estratigr\u00e1fico espec\u00edfico, \n\nprincipalmente nos locais onde as massas de quartzo possuem espessura de mais de 10m. Nesses \n\ncasos, conforme ilustrado nos mapas geol\u00f3gicos dos n\u00edveis 1 e 2, os corpos de min\u00e9rio ora \n\nposicionam-se pr\u00f3ximos \u00e0 capa ora pr\u00f3ximos a lapa e freq\u00fcentemente encontram-se  inseridos no \n\ninterior dos bols\u00f5es de quartzo. J\u00e1 o estudo bi-variante simplificado mostrou, atrav\u00e9s dos \n\ndiagramas de dispers\u00e3o, \u00edndices de correla\u00e7\u00e3o relativamente baixos entre ouro e enxofre. Por fim, \n\nos resultados obtidos na simula\u00e7\u00e3o condicional gaussiana fortalecem e comprovam o alto n\u00edvel de \n\nvariabilidade n\u00e3o s\u00f3 dos teores de ouro, mas principalmente da espessura. \n\n Os resultados do processamento dos dados dos levantamentos geof\u00edsicos, juntamente com \n\na aplica\u00e7\u00e3o dos m\u00e9todos de invers\u00e3o para a regi\u00e3o do dep\u00f3sito Lamego e dos alvos sat\u00e9lites, \n\napresentaram um elevado \u00edndice de correla\u00e7\u00e3o com os corpos sulfetados e anomalias de solo, \n\ntanto em superf\u00edcie quanto em profundidade. As anomalias de EM e IP (principalmente a IP1), \n\nap\u00f3s a invers\u00e3o geof\u00edsica, mostraram uma ader\u00eancia geom\u00e9trica e posicional proeminente em \n\n\n\n146 \n\npraticamente todos os cinco corpos sulfetados do dep\u00f3sito Lamego. Al\u00e9m disso, as se\u00e7\u00f5es de IP \n\ncontribu\u00edram para mostrar a continuidade SW do Corpo Carruagem, comprovada pelos resultados \n\npositivos da sondagem adicional de superf\u00edcie. A anomalia de cargabilidade localizada no \n\nprolongamento NE do corpo Carruagem foi modelada e testada. Os resultados obtidos pela \n\nsondagem comprovaram a anomalia pela presen\u00e7a de intensa sulfeta\u00e7\u00e3o em xisto carbonoso com \n\npequenas venula\u00e7\u00f5es de quartzo, por\u00e9m sem resultados expressivos de ouro.  \n\nAs anomalias de IP nos alvos S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9, Biquinha, Sobradinho e Bom Caminho \n\napresentaram boas correla\u00e7\u00f5es com as informa\u00e7\u00f5es geol\u00f3gicas e geoqu\u00edmicas de superf\u00edcie e \n\nforam comprovadas pelos resultados obtidos nas sondagens explorat\u00f3rias. \n\nUma tabela s\u00edntese, com as propor\u00e7\u00f5es espec\u00edficas de sulfetos dos corpos do dep\u00f3sito \n\nLamego e alvos sat\u00e9lites, em conjunto com as respectivas intensidades de sinais de cargabilidade, \n\nresistividade e EM, foi produzida, permitindo caracterizar comparativamente as assinaturas \n\ngeoqu\u00edmicas e geof\u00edsicas dos diversos corpos estudados. Essa s\u00edntese tem um aspecto pioneiro e  \n\npode ser usada para auxiliar em pesquisas explorat\u00f3rias aur\u00edferas em outros greenstone belts.  \n\nOs resultados obtidos pelos m\u00e9todos das m\u00faltiplas se\u00e7\u00f5es horizontais submetidas aos \n\noperadores de l\u00f3gica fuzzy apresentaram uma razo\u00e1vel correla\u00e7\u00e3o geom\u00e9trica com o produto do \n\nprocesso de invers\u00e3o geof\u00edsica dos dados de EM no dep\u00f3sito de Morro da Gl\u00f3ria, embora com \n\nresolu\u00e7\u00f5es e escalas diferenciadas. \n\nOs procedimentos geoestat\u00edsticos aplicados e desenvolvidos no segundo cap\u00edtulo \n\nauxiliaram no esclarecimento de um conjunto de quest\u00f5es metalogen\u00e9ticas associadas ao dep\u00f3sito \n\nLamego. O estudo bi-variante mostrou o baixo fator de correla\u00e7\u00e3o Au x S principalmente nos \n\ncorpos Arco da Velha e Carruagem, corroborando com a dificuldade de se considerar a sulfeta\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ncomo guia prospectivo nessas \u00e1reas. J\u00e1 nos corpos Queimada e Cabe\u00e7a de Pedra, o \u00edndice de \n\ncorrela\u00e7\u00e3o entre essas duas vari\u00e1veis s\u00e3o um pouco superiores. No entanto, sugere-se cautela para \n\nuso dos teores de enxofre como guia prospectivo nesses dois corpos.  \n\nOs resultados apresentados nos pain\u00e9is volum\u00e9tricos horizontais apontam um \n\nempobrecimento relativo dos teores de Au em profundidade nos corpos Carruagem e Arco da \n\nVelha. Como o n\u00famero de informa\u00e7\u00f5es em n\u00edveis mais profundos \u00e9 muito menor, tal conclus\u00e3o \n\npode ser ainda question\u00e1vel, embora os n\u00fameros apontem tal tend\u00eancia. J\u00e1 os resultados obtidos \n\nnos pain\u00e9is volum\u00e9tricos verticais indicam enriquecimento dos teores \u00e0 medida que se avan\u00e7a \n\npara Norte. Tais fen\u00f4menos podem estar associados a pulsos de deforma\u00e7\u00e3o, onde o ac\u00famulo de \n\nfluidos hidrotermais mineralizantes \u00e9 concentrado nesses locais e/ou associados \u00e0 traps \n\n\n\n147 \n\nestruturais que ajudam a acumular os fluidos nas por\u00e7\u00f5es setentrionais e mais rasas desses corpos. \n\nAl\u00e9m disso, a macro estrutura do Lamego poderia ter sido formada originalmente ao longo de um \n\neixo com a mesma dire\u00e7\u00e3o do acamamento, por\u00e9m com mergulho acentuado p\\ NE. O Corpo \n\nCarruagem estaria em um n\u00edvel crustal mais profundo, enquanto o corpo Cabe\u00e7a de Pedra estaria \n\nassociado a n\u00edveis crustais mais rasos. Esta quest\u00e3o poderia ser ent\u00e3o relacionada a esse relativo \n\nenriquecimento dos teores de ouro \u00e0 medida que se aproxima do extremo NE do Dep\u00f3sito.  \n\nOs resultados obtidos atrav\u00e9s das 100 realiza\u00e7\u00f5es na simula\u00e7\u00e3o condicional gaussiana \n\napontam um elevado \u00edndice de incerteza associado principalmente \u00e0 geometria dos corpos \n\nmineralizados e a variabilidade dos teores de ouro, o que interfere no cuidado ao se declarar \n\nrecursos medidos no dep\u00f3sito estudado. \n\nPrincipais Contribui\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nO acervo de informa\u00e7\u00f5es e conhecimentos produzidos e desenvolvidos nesta pesquisa \n\ncontribuiu para avan\u00e7os cient\u00edficos a respeito da caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o geol\u00f3gica, geof\u00edsica e geoqu\u00edmica \n\ndo dep\u00f3sito Lamego a adjac\u00eancias, bem como permitiu um incremento do conhecimento \n\nmetalogen\u00e9tico deste dep\u00f3sito.  \n\nComo parte dos resultados, foi gerada uma tabula\u00e7\u00e3o in\u00e9dita da associa\u00e7\u00e3o entre \n\nintensidades de sinais geof\u00edsicos com diferentes propor\u00e7\u00f5es de sulfetos em rochas espec\u00edficas do \n\nGrupo Nova Lima no Quadril\u00e1tero Ferr\u00edfero, hospedeiras de mineraliza\u00e7\u00f5es aur\u00edferas em \n\nambientes mesotermais. Essa s\u00edntese tem desdobramentos em ci\u00eancia b\u00e1sica (na medida em que \n\nproporciona um avan\u00e7o no conhecimento da rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre vari\u00e1veis f\u00edsicas e qu\u00edmicas em rochas \n\ncom mais alto conte\u00fado metal\u00edfero); e tecnol\u00f3gicos, visto que permite uma sintoniza\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nferramentas explorat\u00f3rias baseadas em instrumentos geof\u00edsicos. \n\n  A metodologia de programa\u00e7\u00e3o das se\u00e7\u00f5es de IP (longitudinal \u00e0 dire\u00e7\u00e3o do strike) e a \n\ninvestiga\u00e7\u00e3o da proje\u00e7\u00e3o das evid\u00eancias de superf\u00edcie s\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m mecanismos apresentados que \n\npodem ajudar em programas de explora\u00e7\u00e3o mineral. \n\nA intensidade da sulfeta\u00e7\u00e3o definitivamente n\u00e3o deve ser considerada como guia no \n\navan\u00e7o e desenvolvimento dos n\u00edveis dos corpos do Lamego, principalmente Carruagem e Arco \n\nda Velha, visto sua baixa correla\u00e7\u00e3o espacial com teores mais altos de ouro. \n\nUm modelo de configura\u00e7\u00e3o de um programa de adi\u00e7\u00e3o e convers\u00e3o de recursos foi \n\nproposto como parte da pesquisa e pode tamb\u00e9m se usado como refer\u00eancia em outros dep\u00f3sitos \n\ncom caracter\u00edsticas semelhantes. \n\n\n\n148 \n\nO detalhamento geol\u00f3gico dos corpos no n\u00edvel 2 do dep\u00f3sito Lamego, com base nos dados \n\nde sondagem e canaletas, juntamente com modelagem 3D dos corpos de min\u00e9rio, possibilitou \n\navan\u00e7os no conhecimento geol\u00f3gico e distribui\u00e7\u00e3o das mineraliza\u00e7\u00f5es e teores em estruturas \n\ncomplexas, poli-deformadas.  \n\n\n\n149 \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\nAlkmim, F.
