This led to \n\na complementary study, where industrial scalenohedral PCC (Precipitated Calcium Carbonate) \n\nparticles contacted with the citrate buffer, confirming that in fact the origin of the lamellar \n\nstructures is related to it. \n\nThis dissertation aims to study and optimize the conditions of the reaction between the \n\ncitrate buffer and the mineral particles. To understand which variables influence this PCC \n\nmodification and later apply these particles as coating pigment and paper filler to evaluate the \n\nresultant properties, are also objectives of the work. \n\nA preliminary research was made where the influence of the pH buffer and CIT (Citric \n\nAcid)/PCC ratio was studied, at 50\u00baC. From this experimental investigation resulted two new \n\nprotocols to have a better control of CIT/PCC ratio. Also, an experiment using GCC as starting \n\nmaterial was made. From this approach, it was concluded that the lamellar particles are \n\nfavourable to form in a suspension with pH 5.5. The CIT/PCC can be controlled by the different \n\nprotocols, where a solution of CIT (1M) is added to the PCC suspension or two distinct \n\nsolutions of CIT (1M) and NaOH (1M) are added separately until the optimum pH is reached. \n\nThe modification of GCC particles did not present lamellar morphology, but a platy/rounded \n\none. \n\nThese particles were subjected to thermal analysis (calcination and TGA up to 900 \u00baC) \n\nrevealing that calcium citrate is its major component, ca. 30% is CaCO3 and 10% are \n\nunidentified compounds. The size of the particles was measured by the LDS technique, \n\nrevealing that the modified particles are smaller than the starting material, having an average \n\nsize of 3.30 \u2013 3.50 \u00b5m. The modified particles obtained from GCC present higher size than its \n\noriginal one. Relatively to the particles surface charge, it was found the new structures are \n\nhighly negative. \n\nThe modified particles were applied as paper pigment coating. The coatings with the \n\npigments produced with citrate buffer exhibited higher optical density and higher gamut area \n\nvalues when compared with the paper base, revealing promising results of these particles in \n\nincreasing paper printing quality. Contrarily, the PCC particles modified only with a CIT \n\nsolution and all GCC modified particles, did not present results as good as the previous. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFrom the application of these particles into the paper matrix resulted sheets with lower \n\nfiller content. For this reason, conclusions about the influence of these fillers in the paper \n\nproperties are not possible. Further studies are needed related with the retention agent, and the \n\npossible tendency of the particles to flocculate. \n\n \n\n \n\nKey-words: Lamellar; Precipitated Calcium Carbonate; Sodium Citrate; Fillers; Pigment; \n\nPaper. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nResumo  \n\n \n\nA partir de estrat\u00e9gias de dissolu\u00e7\u00e3o da matriz fibrosa presente no papel de impress\u00e3o e \n\nescrita, recorrendo a tamp\u00e3o citrato, com o objetivo de separar o material inorg\u00e2nico, resultaram \n\nestruturas lamelares interessantes do ponto de vista papeleiro. Este estudo realizado num \n\ntrabalho anterior, levou a um outro estudo complementar: foi adicionado tamp\u00e3o citrato ao PCC \n\n(Carbonato de C\u00e1lcio Precipitado) escalenoedro industrial, provando assim a origem destas \n\nestruturas. \n\nA presente disserta\u00e7\u00e3o tem como objetivo o estudo e otimiza\u00e7\u00e3o da rea\u00e7\u00e3o que ocorre entre \n\no tamp\u00e3o citrato e as part\u00edculas minerais. Pretende-se tamb\u00e9m entender que vari\u00e1veis \n\ninfluenciam a modifica\u00e7\u00e3o do PCC. Posteriormente, a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o destas part\u00edculas como \n\npigmento de revestimento do papel e filler \u00e9 avaliada pelas propriedades obtidas. \n\nNum estudo preliminar foi estudada a influ\u00eancia do pH do tamp\u00e3o citrato e a raz\u00e3o entre \n\n\u00e1cido c\u00edtrico e part\u00edculas de carbonato de c\u00e1lcio (CIT/PCC) \u00e0 temperatura de 50 \u00baC. Desta \n\ninvestiga\u00e7\u00e3o resultaram dois novos protocolos com o objetivo de ter um melhor controlo da \n\nraz\u00e3o CIT/PCC. Foi tamb\u00e9m realizada uma experi\u00eancia usando GCC como material de partida. \n\nDesta abordagem conclui-se que as part\u00edculas lamelares se formam favoravelmente quando a \n\nsuspens\u00e3o se encontra a pH 5,5. A raz\u00e3o CIT/PCC pode ser controlada pelos diferentes \n\nprotolocos criados onde uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1cido c\u00edtrico (1M) \u00e9 adicionada \u00e0 suspens\u00e3o de PCC, \n\nou quando duas solu\u00e7\u00f5es distintas de CIT (1M) e NaOH (1M) s\u00e3o adicionadas separadamente \n\nat\u00e9 que o pH \u00f3timo seja atingido. Da modifica\u00e7\u00e3o das part\u00edculas de GCC resultaram part\u00edculas \n\ncom morfologias semelhantes a uma moeda. \n\nDa an\u00e1lise t\u00e9rmica destas part\u00edculas (calcina\u00e7\u00e3o e TGA at\u00e9 900 \u00baC) conclui-se que as \n\namostras t\u00eam como maior constituinte citrato de c\u00e1lcio, cerca de 30% de CaCO3 e 10% de \n\ncompostos que n\u00e3o foi poss\u00edvel identificar. A an\u00e1lise \u00e0 energia de carga superficial revelou que \n\nas part\u00edculas modificadas s\u00e3o eletricamente negativas. \n\nAs part\u00edculas foram aplicadas como pigmento de revestimento. Dos revestimentos onde \n\nforam usadas part\u00edculas modificadas com tamp\u00e3o citrato, obtiveram-se valores de densidade \n\n\u00f3tica elevados, resultando por consequ\u00eancia em valores que \u00e1rea gamut superiores aos obtidos \n\nno papel base usado. Este facto revela resultados promissores na aplica\u00e7\u00e3o destas part\u00edculas \n\npara o aumento da qualidade de impress\u00e3o. As part\u00edculas modificadas apenas com solu\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nCIT e as resultantes da modifica\u00e7\u00e3o de GCC n\u00e3o apresentaram resultados t\u00e3o bons como os \n\nanteriores. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nA aplica\u00e7\u00e3o destas part\u00edculas na matriz do papel n\u00e3o foi bem sucedida uma vez que resultou \n\nna forma\u00e7\u00e3o de folhas com pouca percentagem de filler. Por esta raz\u00e3o, n\u00e3o podem ser tiradas \n\nconclus\u00f5es acerca da influ\u00eancia que estas part\u00edculas podem ter nas propriedades do papel. \n\nPosteriormente, ser\u00e1 necess\u00e1rio fazer-se estudos relacionados com o agente de reten\u00e7\u00e3o usado \n\ne sobre a poss\u00edvel tend\u00eancia das part\u00edculas para flocular. \n\n \n\n \n\nPalavras-Chave:

Introduction \n\n1 \n\n \n\n \n\n1 Introduction \n \n\n1.1  Motivation and Objectives \n \n\nMineral fillers, which are paper functional additives, can be found in different types of \n\npaper, being mostly used on printing and writing paper grades. \n\nThese minerals have several properties (such as morphology, size, surface area, and \n\nbrightness and chemical composition) that improve paper properties such as optical properties, \n\nbulk (specific volume of the paper), smoothness, and printability. Besides, since fibers are \n\nreplaced by mineral fillers, these have also a very positive impact on the economy of the paper \n\nmaking process. \n\n Mineral particles can represent 20 to 30% of the paper composition, and higher values are \n\nuncommon because fillers disrupt the fiber network, so disturbing some mechanical properties \n\nsuch as tensile strength and stiffness (Hubbe and Gill, 2016).  \n\nIn this scenery, for benchmarking and reverse engineering reasons, it is of utmost \n\nimportance to access the content and structure of the fillers in the paper sheets, and this requires \n\nthe deconstruction of the fiber matrix without damaging the fillers, as much as possible. \n\nIn a previous work, different strategies to deconstruct the fibrous matrix of commercial \n\nprinting and writing papers (P&amp;W) were studied, aiming at isolating the mineral fillers without \n\ntheir degradation. In this work, a biological solvent containing citrate buffer was used, among \n\nother chemical treatments, and as a result particles of PCC (Precipitated Calcium Carbonate) \n\nwith an interesting lamellar shape were obtained, as revealed by FESEM (Field Emission \n\nScanning Electron Microscopy). \n\nThis discovery led to a complementary study on what effect could this buffer have on the \n\nindustrial PCC particles. It was confirmed that the citrate buffer can change the scalenohedral \n\noriginal PCC shape to a lamellar one. This kind of structure may have a positive impact on \n\npaper properties when used as filler or also as a pigment coating. \n\nIn this context, the present work was developed with the objective of optimizing the \n\nconditions of the reaction between the citrate buffer and the mineral particles, and also of \n\nevaluating the resultant mineral structure and its influence on paper properties (both when used \n\nin the matrix or at the surface as pigment coating). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nNew Precipitated Calcium Carbonate Derived Structures for Application in Papermaking \n\n2 \n\n \n\n1.2  Thesis Structure \n \n\nThis dissertation is divided into the following chapters: \n\n- Chapter 1: Introduction \n\nThis chapter serves to explain the purpose of the study and how it was structured. \n\n- Chapter 2: Literature Review \n\nIn this chapter, a theoretical framework about papermaking and paper coating is presented. \n\nAlso, an approach about paper fillers and coating pigments is also made. Furthermore, a \n\nreference about the interaction between PCC and organic compounds is reviewed and a more \n\ndetailed description about its interaction with citric acid is examined. \n\n- Chapter 3: Materials and Methods \n\nThis chapter describes the materials and methods used in this work, with the aim that the \n\nobtained results can be reproduced by others. \n\n- Chapter 4: Results and Discussion \n\nThe results related with the particles characterization, and their application as paper coating \n\npigment and filler are presented and discussed in this chapter. \n\n- Chapter 5: Conclusions \n\nThe conclusions that resulted from the previous chapter are summarized. \n\n- Chapter 6: Future works \n\nSeveral suggestions of work that was not possible to perform in the present study are given. \n\n- Appendices: \n\nThis chapter includes data and information that could be important for better understanding \n\nof the present work. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n2.Paper and Papermaking \n\n3 \n\n \n\n2 Paper and Papermaking \n \n\nIn a broader definition, paper is a suspension of cellulosic fibers, properly mixed and \n\nprepared to form stable bonds with each other that can originate a structure able to support \n\ntraces and stains or used as packaging material as well as other specific applications. The fibrous \n\nsuspension is essentially originated by plants, and additives can be added to it. The final sheet \n\nis formed after the elimination of water through the mesh of the web and successive drying. \n\nPaper applications are very vast, however printing and writing (P&amp;W) papers are the most \n\nwidely used, and wood is the main cellulosic source. \n\nIn the papermaking process, wood is used as a renewable raw material that comes from \n\nwell managed forests. The process starts by debarking and chipping the wood. Then the pulp \n\nmanufacture can be done by mechanical or chemical methods, depending on the desired final \n\nsheet. Chemical pulping is the most used process to obtain high quality printing papers and its \n\nobjective is to remove the lignin components without destroying the cellulosic fibers. In this \n\nstage, wasted paper for recycling (after de-inking) and broke (paper trimmings and paper that \n\nmust be reprocessed in the mill) can be added to the mixture. \n\nThe next step is refining and it is one of the most important operations since it determines \n\nsome physical properties and the quality of the final sheet - it increases the apparent density of \n\nthe paper (Hubbe and Gill, 2016). Here, fibers suffer mechanical action (such as tensile, \n\ncompressive, shear and bending forces) that opens up and divides them, increasing their surface \n\narea and consequently improving the fiber bonding. Before heading to the paper machine, fibers \n\nare washed and screened. Chemical additives can also be added, including dyes and pigments, \n\nand also fillers (Bajpai, 2015). \n\nThe stock is fed into the paper machine and water is removed forming the paper web, \n\ninitially with the consistency of 0.1%. The sheet is formed in the wire section where water is \n\ndrained through the mesh and fibers are aligned in the machine direction. Vacuum boxes located \n\nunder the wire also help the water drainage. After this, paper undergoes compression, to squeeze \n\nout more water, and drying, where the remaining water (4-6%) is removed by evaporation. This \n\nlast step, despite only removing a small amount of water, is the most expensive one as it requires \n\nhigh energy. The forming paper reaches the consistency value of 97%. \n\nAt the end of the paper machine, the paper is rolled up and cut with the desired diameter. \n\nDepending on the purpose of the paper, the process is now finished or it will require other \n\noperations such as coating, calendaring and winding. \n\nThe coating step is usually done in papers that demand high quality and brightness. The \n\ncoating layer is added to the base paper that was produced in the paper machine, and it is \n\n\n\nNew Precipitated Calcium Carbonate Derived Structures for Application in Papermaking \n\n4 \n\n \n\ncomposed by pigments (eg. clay, calcium carbonate), binders (starch) and other additives such \n\nas polymers and optical brighteners (Biermann, 1996). Binders are used to ensure that the filler \n\nmaterial connects with the paper surface, forming a cohesive layer. This operation improves, \n\nnot only the uniformity of the paper but also the smoothness and brightness of the base paper. \n\nIt also has an important role in the printing process, since it refines the resolution of printed \n\nimages, improving the gloss of the film and decreasing the show-through, keeping the ink into \n\nthe paper surface. \n\nAn on-machine process called calendaring follows the previous step, where the paper \n\npasses by a series of polished steel rolls. Here the irregularities in the sheet are reduced, \n\nimproving the smoothness and creating a sheet with higher density. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1  Paper fillers \n \n\nAs it was previously said, the paper is not made only of cellulosic fibers and that happens \n\nbecause the fibers themselves do not comply the requirements of the final customer, with the \n\nregard to opacity, in typical grades of printing papers, at lower values of basis weight (mass per \n\nunit of area). Thus, the use of mineral loading gives the papermaker several ways to meet \n\ncustomer needs and profitability. Also, to aid the process of papermaking and to improve the \n\nfinished sheet, various types of fillers and additives are added to the pulp before formation \n\n(Hubbe and Gill, 2016).  \n\nIn terms of additives, they can be classified as functional and control additives. The first \n\ntype includes dyes, internal sizing agents, adhesives, and fillers; the second one refers to \n\nbiocides, drainage and retention aids and defoamers, and they do not affect the final paper \n\ndirectly and are not necessarily retained on it (Biermann, 1996). \n\nFillers, by definition, are water insoluble substances with size magnitude of 0.1 to 10?m \n\ndispersed into the slurry before paper formation (Hubbe and Gill, 2016). Being the second \n\ningredient with the major percentage in the paper, fillers have dominant application in P&amp;W \n\npapers. There are several reasons for its use, one of them is to reduce the cost of paper \n\nproduction, where the increase of 1% in loading material saves approximately $2.50/ton in \n\nfeedstock and energy costs. This cost reduction is due to the drainage and drying improvement \n\n(energy savings), and to the use of less virgin pulp, since the capacity of paper production can \n\nbe increased with the use of mechanical pulp (with low quality) and recycled pulp (Hu, Shao, \n\nLi, et al., 2009; Bajpai, 2015). \n\n\n\n2.Paper and Papermaking \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nThe filler shape is an important factor to have in consideration, since it affects the light \n\nscattering properties, the calendaring process, the drying rate, and the air permeability of the \n\npaper (Biermann, 1996). In terms of shape, they can be classified as \u201cplaty\u201d, where are included \n\nclay, talc, and mica, or as \u201cblocky\u201d, such as ground calcium carbonate (GCC) (Hubbe and Gill, \n\n2016). \n\nDepending on the filler size distribution, fillers can have different behavior if applied as a \n\ncoating or bulk material. In the coating process, a wide particle size distribution can be an \n\nadvantage, as the particles join together forming a dense layer (Hubbe and Gill, 2016). \n\nHowever, as paper filling, a uniform particle size distribution has a better impact. Besides it, in \n\nthis context, the mineral length is a key factor, since particles with a larger diameter may not \n\nbe retained in the matrix due to their decreased specific surface area. On the contrary, smaller \n\nparticles have a higher surface area but they compete with the sizing agent, being difficult to \n\ngive internal sizing to the final sheet (Biermann, 1996). \n\nAmong other reasons, mineral loading contributes to improving the paper formation since \n\nit fills the empty spaces around the fibers. For this reason, the inorganic material provides the \n\nsheet a more uniform and a smoother surface, increases the opacity and brightness and enhances \n\nthe printability (the show through is decreased and the receptivity to ink is increased) (Au and \n\nThron, 1995; Jimoh, Ariffin, et al., 2017). \n\nIt is obvious that, depending on the interaction of the filler with inks, glues, or other \n\npolymers, applied to the paper surface, the final product can be differentiated. So, a detailed \n\nknowledge of the mineral composition and morphology can be helpful to the papermaker to \n\nevaluate the pros and cons of the use of a certain filler. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2  Coating process  \n \n\nThe coating process is commonly used in the papermaking industry to improve the \n\nappearance and printability of the paper. The base paper is rough and difficult to cover with a \n\nthin coating layer. For printing methods it is required that the coating layer is homogeneous and \n\ncovers the substrate. The desired properties for a coated paper are usually high brightness and \n\nhigh gloss. Although, this step increases the production cost and is therefore mainly used when \n\nthe appearance of the product is of great importance. \n\nIn paper coating, an aqueous suspension is applied to the base paper surface, filling the \n\nuneven spaces, and covering the highest lying fibers as possible. The size of the covering layer \n\n\n\nNew Precipitated Calcium Carbonate Derived Structures for Application in Papermaking \n\n6 \n\n \n\nis influenced by its density: for the same weight, a coating with low density has a greater \n\ncovering area than a coating with high density. It can be done in one side, or in both sides of \n\nthe sheet. After, the paper is dried and finished, achieving the gloss and smoothness required.  \n\nThe suspension used for the coating is a mixture of water with white pigments (eg. clay, \n\ncalcium carbonate, talc and titanium dioxide) and binders (eg. starch and latex). Some additives \n\ncan be added to influence the solid content, rheology and water retention, such as dispersants \n\nand thickeners. The coating layer consolidates as water evaporates, allowing the binder to form \n\nbridges between the pigment particles and the base paper. This suspension should only contain \n\nthe necessary amount of water to ensure flow properties, in order to save energy and costs for \n\ndrying. In the industrial coating, the solid content is about 70wt%. \n\nAs one of the purposes for coating paper is to enhance the printability, the coating layer \n\nshould be strong enough to resist the stress of the printing process, thus there is an allowable \n\nminimum amount of binder that can give the necessary strength to the coating. However, when \n\nthe suspension has excess of binder, it can have a negative effect on the coated paper such as \n\nlow opacity and gloss, as well as glueability problems. \n\nThe industrial coating technique is in constant evolution to comply with the demands for \n\nhigh quality and faster production. The most common coating processes used are applicator \n\nrolls (also called dip coater) and jet applicators (Figure 1). In these methods, an excess of coat \n\nis applied to the substrate that is after measured with the desired coat weight (Ek, Gellerstedt \n\nand Henriksson, 2009). In the first method, the suspension is transferred from a bin to the \n\nsubstrate which is supported by a large backing roll. The amount of coating transferred to the \n\nsubstrate is influenced by the distance between the backing roll and the applicator, the speed of \n\nthe applicator, and by the viscosity of the mixture. The jet applicator applies the coating \n\nsuspension on the paper surface through a nozzle and here, the coating transfer is controlled by \n\nthe width of the opening, the pressure of the jet and the angle of the applicator to the moving \n\npaper web. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Coating process: Applicator Roll (left) and jet applicators  Adapted \nfrom (Ek, Gellerstedt and Henriksson, 2009) \n\n\n\n2.Paper and Papermaking \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nIn laboratory studies, the coating process is made with a bench coater, an equipment very \n\neasy to handle. This coater uses a rod placed on the top of the substrate which is attached to a \n\nholder that moves the rod over the substrate at a given speed. The coating suspension is applied \n\nmanually in front of the rod and then is transferred to the substrate by the gap between the rod \n\nand the paper surface. The excess of coating is pushed forwards by the moving rod until the end \n\nof the paper base. The thickness of the coating layer is controlled not only by the distance \n\nbetween the rod and the surface, but also by the kind of rod used. \n\nWhen the coating is applied in the paper, the water is absorbed into the paper and the natural \n\nevaporation helps to promote the drying process. However, the absorption of water must be \n\nallowed in the shortest time as possible to preserve the dimensional and strength properties of \n\npaper. To speed up the drying process the coated paper is dried by means of air or infrared (IR) \n\ndryers. The last ones can remove water more efficiently than the air dryers, and for that reason \n\nare the most used dryers. \n\nThe properties of the final coated paper can be improved by the calendering process, \n\nproducing a surface suitable for printing. Here, the paper undergoes compression in one or more \n\nrolling nips, reducing the roughness of the surface. These rolls can be heated or have a higher \n\nline load to increase the compression. However, in this treatment, the temperature has high \n\nimpact in the increasing of gloss and decreasing of roughness. Besides its positive effects, \n\ncalendering promotes the decreasing of the opacity and brightness of the coating layer. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3 Pigments \n \n\nThe pigment particles in the coating layer represent about 85-95wt% of the coating layer, \n\nand its properties influence not only the coating layer formation but also the calendaring \n\nprocess. The coating mixture must be able to flow during the application and should cover all \n\nthe paper fibers. Because of the last reason, coarse and platy particles as well as high coat \n\nweights are often used in the mixture; also, the minerals used are white pigments to hide the \n\nfibers and thus allowing the improvement of brightness, whiteness, opacity, and smoothness.  \n\nThe cost of the coating is determined by the pigment used, and the more commonly used \n\nare calcium carbonates and kaolin. These pigments are usually from natural origin and are \n\nphysically and chemically homogenous; their properties (such as particle size and distribution, \n\nparticle shape, refractive index, light scattering, light absorption, and density) can affect the \n\nfinal appearance of the coating as it can be seen in Table 1 (Holik, 2013; Bajpai, 2015). \n\n\n\nNew Precipitated Calcium Carbonate Derived Structures for Application in Papermaking \n\n8 \n\n \n\nThe largest dimension of a pigment is defined as its aspect ratio and gives the platiness of \n\nthe pigment, responsible for the properties of the coated paper such as gloss and porosity of the \n\nsurface (Holik, 2013). Those pigments are often agglomerates or aggregates of many particles, \n\nwhich can be difficult to measure in size. For that reason there are techniques, such as laser \n\nlight diffraction that provide the particle size distribution (PSD) of equivalent spherical \n\nparticles, however it can be used as comparative methods for particles with other shapes. A \n\nnarrow PSD has very small and very large pigment particles, which leads to a more porous \n\nstructure of the coating layer, contributing strongly to optical properties such as increasing of \n\ngloss and brightness. However finer particles promote higher gloss and lower roughness of \n\ncoatings (Caner, Farnood and Yan, 2006). \n\n \n\nTable 1. Influence of pigment properties on coating \n\nIncreased platiness and /or particle size Better gloss development \n\nIncreased refractive index and /or particle size Higher opacity \n\nDecrease in light absorption Higher brightness \n\nDecrease in packing \n\nHigher porosity and better ink absorption \n\nHigher bulk and better coverage \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.1 Printing process and printing quality \n\n \n\nPrinting properties are dependent on the coating process, since this treatment enhances the \n\npaper surface properties, and can make it suitable to receive ink. The objective of printing is to \n\nreproduce texts and coloured pictures using cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks (CMYK). \n\nNowadays, the processes used for printing proposes are the technologies of offset, flexographic \n\nand rotogravure printing. In addition, digital printing process, such as inkjet and xerography, \n\nare also widely used (Holik, 2013). The process used in the present work is the inkjet printing, \n\nand for that reason, this section will be relative to it.  \n\nIn the inkjet printing the image formed directly on the substrate is controlled by digital \n\ndata. For this reason, this system can work with a large variety of inks and is able to print several \n\nkinds of data. Inkjet papers are usually coated by starches, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polymers, \n\nand pigments. This is mostly made to enhance the whiteness and the inks\u2019 receptivity to the \n\nsurface (Mesic and Johnston, 2013). \n\n\n\n2.Paper and Papermaking \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nIt is a contactless printing process, which means that it can be used in several types of \n\nsubstrates. The ink passes from a reservoir and can be propel onto the paper in two distinct \n\nways: drop-on-demand (DOD) and continuous inkjet. In the DOD inkjet, the ink droplets are \n\nexpelled from the reservoir, directly to the paper, due to a pressure change created by a heating \n\nelement or a piezoelectric element. In continuous inkjet, a continuous flow of ink is created by \n\nmeans of a pump, and with help of the vibration of piezoelectric crystals, it is broken into \n\nindividual droplets. This droplets are then charged and subjected to an electrostatic field, \n\ncontrolling this way their direction to a specific point (Singh et al., 2010). \n\nThe print quality is influenced by the ink properties (surface tension and viscosity), which \n\ncontrol the droplet spreading, and by the substrate\u2019s absorption properties, such as roughness, \n\nsurface tension and porosity (Martin, 2005). The inks used in this printing process are normally \n\ncomposed by an aqueous solvent that serves as a vehicle for dyes and pigments to disperse \n\nevenly.  \n\n Despite the fact that the ink needs to be rapidly immobilized onto the paper surface, its \n\nhigh absorbency can lead to print-through and poor optical density. However, if the absorption \n\nprocess takes more time than the desired, it may spread laterally resulting in colour-to-bleed. \n\nTo have the pretended printing quality properties, it is the major importance to control ink \n\nspreading, holdout and its penetration in the paper; the paper opacity is also an aspect to be \n\ntaken into account. \n\nThe printing quality requires the evaluation of its parameters with high exigency. \n\nPrintability results from the complex interactions between the ink, the printing process, and the \n\npaper. The sheet must be able to accept evenly the solids of the ink, without the formation of \n\nirregular films and stains (Bajpai, 2015). \n\nThe evaluation of the printing quality should be made with methods able to quantify \n\nnumerically its parameters. These tests evaluate the uniformity, definition, contrast and optical \n\ndensity. Some important aspects related to these properties are: \n\n \n\n- Mottling: stained pattern observed in a printed sheet. \n\n \n\n- Colour-to-colour bleeding: measure the mixture between two adjacent colours. This \n\nparameter is related to the lateral spreading of the ink to an adjacent area where another colour \n\nwas printed. This phenomenon is due to low ink absorption in the paper, leading to higher \n\ndrying time, and increasing the risk of blending between the two colours. \n\n \n\n\n\nNew Precipitated Calcium Carbonate Derived Structures for Application in Papermaking \n\n10 \n\n \n\n- Optical Density: it is dependent on the amount of ink that penetrates in the paper. It is \n\ngiven by the relation between of light reflected from a paper sheet before and after printing. A \n\nhigher optical density corresponds to a thicker film of ink, resulting in higher colour intensity \n\n(Moutinho, Ferreira and Figueiredo, 2007). \n\n \n\n \n\n- Gamut area: this value translates the paper\u2019s ability to reproduce colours. It is given by \n\nthe area on a hexagon whose vertices correspond to the pairs (a*, b*). These values are \n\nintegrated on the coordinated system CIELab, which uses the colour coordinates L* \n\n(luminosity), a* (measure of shade in the red/green axis), and b* (measure of shade in the \n\nyellow/blue axis). The positive values of a* and b* are the correspondent colours of red and \n\nyellow (Moutinho, Ferreira and Figueiredo, 2007). A representation of this can be seen in \n\nFigure 2 . \n\n \n\n \n\n- Print-through: is relative to the ability to see a printed image on the opposite side of the \n\nsheet. It is calculated with the chromatic coordinates L*, a* and b*, and influenced by the \n\npigment/dye penetration. \n\n \n\n- Show-through: depends on the quantity of pigment/dye that is retained at the paper \n\nsurface. It is also calculated with the chromatic coordinates L*, a* and b*, and it is evaluated \n\nlaying a sheet above the printed one, evaluating the ability to see the printed image through it. \n\n \n\nAnother important aspect of the printing process is the runnability. This parameter is \n\ninfluenced by the strength properties of the paper and corresponds to the velocity that the paper \n\npasses through the printing machine without causing disturbs and stops (Bajpai, 2015). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. CIELab Coordinates \n\n\n\n2.Paper and Papermaking \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n2.4 Inorganic materials most used in the papermaking process \n \n\nThe loading material used onto the paper can be distinguished in two different groups, \n\norganic and inorganic. The organic fillers are mostly used in speciality papers or coated P&amp;W \n\npapers. However, due to their high cost, they are not used in all paper grades. In this group are \n\nincluded polymers, starch derivatives, and resins. The inorganic fillers are the most widely used \n\nin the papermaking process, since they confer great properties to the paper at low cost. \n\nAs it was said before, the main objective of the present thesis is to study the new material \n\nfound in a previous work based on reverse engineering, where the main goal was to isolate the \n\ninorganic fillers contained in the matrix of commercial printing and writing paper, without their \n\ndegradation (Carecho, 2016). \n\nTo better understand some characteristics of this new material, it is important to know in \n\nadvance which are the inorganic fillers most used in the papermaking process, as loading fillers \n\nand as a coating pigments. \n\nAs shown in Figure 3, in terms of quantities applied and global demand in the papermaking \n\nfiller market, the main loading material used are calcium carbonates (64%, where 49%  is GCC \n\nand 15% is PCC), followed by kaolin (29%), titanium dioxide (1%), and talc and other pigments \n\n(6%) (Nutbeem, 2013; Bajpai, 2015). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.

Most of the pigments used in coating are cheaper than chemical pulps, and their \n\nuse represents a very important economic factor. Figure 4 shows the global consumption of the \n\ninorganic materials used as pigments, where it can be highlighted the use of calcium carbonates \n\n(76%) and kaolin (20%) as the minerals with highest demand market (Nutbeem, 2013). \n\nNowadays the use of calcium carbonate is increasing and talc is showing constant growth, \n\nwhereas kaolin is stagnating (Bajpai, 2015). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThere are some important characteristics of the pigment that are very relevant from a \n\npapermaker\u2019s perspective such as colour, brightness, opacity power (given from their scattering \n\ncoefficient) and, of course, its cost. Usually, the fillers with the highest optical performance \n\nhave the smallest particle size, and the highest refractive index, brightness and scattering \n\ncoefficient. Table 2 summarizes typical values for the minerals mentioned before and the \n\nfollowing topics give a brief description of these materials and their properties that will \n\ninfluence in the papermaking process (Holik, 2013; Hubbe and Gill, 2016). More importance \n\nwill be given to PCC, since it was the starting material of the new particles in study in this work. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.

Typical properties of the most used fillers in papermaking. Adapted from Hubbe and Gill (2016), Bajpai (2015), Holik (2013) \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4.1 Kaolin \n\n \n\nKaolin, Al4(OH)8(Si4O10), is a white silicate material that can be found in sedimentary \n\nand metamorphic deposits, and it is formed by decomposition of granite. It has a platy \n\nmorphology and it is predominantly used in uncoated papers. This almost inexpensive mineral \n\nhas desirable optical properties when used as filler, since it lowers the porosity of the sheet \n\nincreasing the gloss of the finished paper after calendaring (Holik, 2013; Bajpai, 2015; Hubbe \n\nand Gill, 2016). \n\nNowadays, kaolin remains a major resource in papermaking as a wet-end additive and as a \n\ncoating pigment. The growth of the supercalendered paper market raises the need of higher \n\nbrightness in the sheets, which promotes the continuous use of kaolin. This is due to its natural \n\nshape that, when used for fiber coverage, leads to paper and printing gloss. Also, mixing this \n\npigment with GCC, PCC and talc can lead to a better performance (Bajpai, 2015). \n\nThe coating pigment is mixed with water and binder, and applied to a paper substrate by \n\nmeans of a high speed blade coater (Bundy and Ishley, 1991). Its particle shape with higher \n\naspect ratio and its high brightness are the most appealing properties for application in the base \n\npaper. After calendering, the particles tend to orient parallel to the surface promoting both \n\nproper smoothness and gloss, giving an optimal ink receptive surface (Bundy and Ishley, 1991; \n\nCaner, Farnood and Yan, 2006; Ek, Gellerstedt and Henriksson, 2009). \n\n \n\n \n\nFiller Types Morphology \nISO \n\nBrightness \n(%) \n\nRefractive \n\nindex \n\nMean \n\ndiameter \n(?m) \n\nDensity \n(g/cm3) \n\nSpecific \n\nSurface \n\nArea \n(m2/g) \n\nKaolin - Platy 70 \u2013 90 1.56 2 \u2013 5 2.6 10 \u2013 20 \n\nTalc - Platy 70 \u2013 88 1.58 1 \u2013 20 2.7 5 \u2013 20 \n\nTiO2 \nRutile Rounded 97 \u2013 99 2.75 0.2 \u2013 0.35 4.2 8 \u2013 12 \n\nAnatase Rounded 97 \u2013 99 2.55 0.3 \u2013 0.35 3.8 8 \u2013 12 \n\nCalcium \n\nCarbonate \n\nNatural Rhombohedral 80 \u2013 96 1.58 0.8 \u2013 2 2.7 2 \u2013 12 \n\nPrecipitated \n\nScalenohedral; \n\nAragonite; \n\nRhombohedral; \n\nclustered or \n\nagglomerated \n\n92 \u2013 99 1.56 0.8 \u2013 2 2.7 4 \u2013 12 \n\n\n\nNew Precipitated Calcium Carbonate Derived Structures for Application in Papermaking \n\n14 \n\n \n\n2.4.2 Talc \n\n \n\nTalc, Mg3Si4O10(OH)2, is a layered silicate with a platy morphology. The layers of this \n\nmineral are electrostatically neutral resulting in a mineral strongly oleophilic. However, due to \n\nits surface properties, talc is known as a detackifier and used a pitch controller in the \n\npapermaking process. This inert mineral is also characterized by its softness and for being \n\norganophilic (helping to reduce dye consumption and two-sidedness in the coloured paper) \n\n(Gane and Ag; Bajpai, 2015; Hubbe and Gill, 2016). \n\nWhen used as a filler, this mineral contributes to paper hydrophobicity and uniformity of \n\ncolour in both sides of the sheet. Due to their relatively large particles and water resistant \n\nparticles, this mineral improves dewatering in the papermaking process, it leads to higher \n\nretention in the sheet and lowers the papers\u2019 strength properties. The pitch control function \n\nleads to a better runnability of the paper machine. Speaking in the paper quality itself, the use \n\nof talc increases the smoothness, gives better printability (especially in rotogravure papers), \n\ndeeper colour in coloured papers, and has a lower impact on strength properties than other fillers \n\n(Holik, 2013; Bajpai, 2015).  \n\nTalc is used nowadays in light weighted coated paper (LWC) and coated fine papers in \n\noffset formulations. As coating pigment, since talc has a low coefficient of friction due to the \n\nlow cohesion that exists between the crystal layers inside the talc particles,  it reduces paper \n\nbreaks, even when subjected to constant tension (Holik, 2013). The properties of the coating \n\ncan improve some properties such as smoothness, coarseness peeling resistance and ink \n\nabsorption. However, talc tends to reduce gloss and prolong the ink drying time. It is also said \n\nthat if a composite of talc and silica is used as coating pigment, it enhances the quality of the \n\nprinted images better than when used as a single pigment (Lin et al., 2016). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4.3 Titanium Dioxide \n\n \n\nTitanium dioxide, TiO2, is a speciality filler and it has the highest brightness, density and \n\nopacity power of all the pigments used in papermaking. However, it costs 5 to 10 times more \n\nthan other commonly used fillers. It is mainly used in paper with low basis weights that have \n\ndemanding requirements for opacity.  \n\nTitanium is the fourth most abundant chemical element on earth and occurs in the form of \n\noxides or mixed oxides of other elements. Titanium dioxide is produced by the sulfate or the \n\nchloride process, and it has three modifications with different structures, giving therefore \n\n\n\n2.Paper and Papermaking \n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\ndifferent physical properties. They are rutile, anatase, and brookite. But, due to their \n\nthermodynamic characteristics and physical properties, rutile and anatase are the most \n\nimportant in the field. These pigments show an extremely high refractive index (2.75 for rutile \n\nand 2.55 for anatase), even when the paper is wet (eg. label paper). Rutile is used in grades that \n\nrequire high opacity, while anatase supports OBAs better. However, the size of the particles of \n\ntitanium dioxide are extremely small with sizes between 0.2?m and 0.25?m, and this mineral \n\nhas a very complex chemistry in application, causing difficulties of retention is the paper web \n\n(Holik, 2013; Morsy et al., 2015; Hubbe and Gill, 2016). \n\nAs paper coating, TiO2 is the most effective white pigment and provides the increase of \n\nopacity of the coated paper, and it also enhances the topographical properties of the paper \n\nsurface.  The quality improvements, besides the ones already mentioned, are related to the \n\nsmoothness and, most importantly, the printability and print image quality. These pigments are \n\noften used together with extenders to provide highest efficiency (Holik, 2013; Morsy et al., \n\n2015). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4.4  Ground Calcium Carbonate \n\n \n\nNatural calcium carbonate, CaCO3, commonly known as GCC, is a filler with an extreme \n\nimportance in the industry. It is predominantly applied in woodfree uncoated papers, \n\nmechanical uncoated paper, newsprint, and coating base papers. The mineral form of GCC \n\noccurs in limestones, chalks or marbles. Depending on the ambient pressure, temperature and \n\nwater contact, calcium carbonate has six different polymorphs: amorphous calcium carbonate \n\n(ACC), calcium carbonate hexahydratate, calcium carbonate monohydratate, vaterite, aragonite \n\nand calcite; its thermodynamic stability increases from ACC to calcite (Hu, Shao, Cai, et al., \n\n2009; El-Sheikh et al., 2013; Hubbe and Gill, 2016; Jimoh, Okoye, et al., 2017). \n\nThe crystal structure of GCC is rhombohedral, and fillers based on limestone and marble \n\nare chosen in the papermaking industry to give higher brightness. In the production of \n\nnewsprint, where there is less demand for brightness, fillers based on chalk are used because of \n\nits lower brightness. The finesses of GCC fillers for paper gives higher gloss and may improve \n\nbrightness, thanks to higher light scattering, low abrasiveness, and low dusting out of the paper \n\nsurface in the printing process. Coarser GCC particles, at a given percentage, tend to increase \n\nthe strength of the sheet and requires low demand of sizing agents, when compared with other \n\ntypes of fillers. \n\n\n\nNew Precipitated Calcium Carbonate Derived Structures for Application in Papermaking \n\n16 \n\n \n\nAnother advantage in the use of GCC in the papermaking is its low cost. The use of GCC \n\nalso promotes drainage, reducing the energy of the drying stage of the papermaking process.  \n\nThe negative surface charge of many GCC products can be controlled with the use of \n\ndispersants, otherwise the behaviour as wet-end additives can be affected. \n\nSince calcium carbonate is soluble under acidic conditions, the papermaking environment \n\nmust be near neutral or at slightly alkaline pH. Paper containing GCC produced under acidic \n\nconditions can decompose relatively faster, requiring expensive measures of conservation. \n\nAs coating pigment, GCC needs less amount of binders and allows drying energy savings. \n\nIts structural shape promotes excellent runnability even with high solid content and highest \n\ncoating speed (Holik, 2013; Bajpai, 2015). \n\nNowadays, GCC particles have been modified, originating a pigment with completely \n\ndifferent morphologies and properties. The specific surface of this mineral can be increased and \n\ncan provide excellent paper properties, such as good printability in offset and rotogravure and \n\neasy gloss development (Wang et al., 2009). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4.5  Precipitated Calcium Carbonate \n\n \n\nStarting from GCC particles, it is possible to synthesize another type of CaCO3, by a \n\nprecipitation reaction, called precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC). The new mineral has \n\ndifferent morphologies, characteristics and crystal size from the precursor material. Generally, \n\nGCC is cheaper than PCC, although due to the grinding process that is necessary to form \n\nparticles size of GCC with several microns, its price increases due to the high-energy costs \n\ninvolved (Hu, Shao, Cai, et al., 2009). \n\n PCC has several advantages over GCC because of its unique properties, high purity, and \n\na uniform particle size distribution and shape. The shape, sizes and properties of the crystal \n\nsurface, depends on the specific synthesis reaction process used. Usually, commercial PCC \n\npurity is about 97% on CaCO3 content, and the remainder is MgCO3 and other residues of the \n\nindustrial process (Hu, Shao, Cai, et al., 2009; El-Sheikh et al., 2013; Holik, 2013; Bajpai, \n\n2015; Jimoh, Okoye, et al., 2017). \n\nThere are several methods of producing PCC, where the simplest one is a solid-liquid route, \n\nwhich involves a direct reaction in aqueous solution between the ions Ca2+ and CO3\n-2. Other \n\ncommon route is the carbonation method, a solid-liquid-gas reaction. Although it is a slower \n\nmethod compared with the first one, it is the procedure most used by the industries due to its \n\nlow cost, higher yield and higher purity. Depending on the geochemical composition, the \n\n\n\n2.Paper and Papermaking \n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\noriginal rock, rich in carbonate, is calcined using temperatures from 900 to 1000 \u00baC to produce \n\ncalcium oxide (also called lime) and carbon dioxide. In this step, 44% of the mineral\u2019s original \n\nmass is lost. After this, the calcium oxide is treated with distilled water to produce calcium \n\nhydroxide (milk of lime). The resulting material is then purified and carbonated with the carbon \n\ndioxide (CO2) obtained earlier in the calcination process. These steps are shown below in the \n\nReactions 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3. The low solubility that CO2 has in water leads to a slower reaction \n\n(Geyssant, 2003; Xiang et al., 2004; Bajpai, 2015; Hubbe and Gill, 2016; Jimoh, Okoye, et al., \n\n2017).  \n\n \n\nCalcination of the limestone: \n\n????3 ? ???+ ??2 (2.1) \n\n Calcium hydroxide production:  \n\n???+?2? ? ??(??)2 (2.2) \n\nPrecipitation:  \n\n??(??)2 + ??2  ?  ????3 (?)+ ?2? (2.3) \n\n \n\nDuring the precipitation step, the exposure of Ca(OH)2 to CO2 gradually lowers the pH. \n\nThis is one of the factors that may influence the size and morphology of the product crystal. \n\nOther factors include temperature, agitation, pressure, reaction speed, addition of other soluble \n\nmaterials. The PCC particles have a more uniform structure compared with GCC. The end \n\nmaterial can have several structures such as scalenohedral, rhombohedral and acicular, as \n\nrepresented in Figure 5. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5. Different morphologies of PCC. A \u2013 Scalenohedral (rosette-shaped), B \u2013 Rhombohedral (cubic-shaped), C - Acicular (needle-\n\nshaped). From Hubbe and Gill (2016) \n\n \n\n\n\nNew Precipitated Calcium Carbonate Derived Structures for Application in Papermaking \n\n18 \n\n \n\nPCC is the most widely used filler for paper and this is motivated by its high light \n\nscattering, making possible to achieve great results of opacity and brightness without the use of \n\nexpensive minerals, such as TiO2 (Velho, 2003). \n\nThe most common kind of PCC used is the scalenohedral one. This shape gives paper \n\nfavourable properties such as stiffness and bulk, when compared with other fillers. Although, a \n\nhigher bulk decreases the strength properties because the sheet becomes more porous and \n\npermeable (Bajpai, 2015; Hubbe and Gill, 2016). This property is also propitious to ink \n\nreceptivity, resulting in better print quality. \n\nAs coating pigment, when blended with GCC, it is possible to adjust a balance between \n\nbulking properties and strength and runnability (Laufamann et al., 2000). Also, strength of the \n\npaper can also be enhanced when using a suspension of PCC with cooking starch. \n\nPCC is a mineral that is in constant study as there are numerous factors that can contribute \n\nto its modification and to improve its use in a specific area. For this reason, there are some \n\ncompanies specialized in the polymorphism\u2019s study of this material for paper application and \n\nimprovement of its properties, when used as filler or coating pigment (Omya, 2015; Imerys, \n\n2017; Inc., 2017).  \n\nSome researchers reported the use of modified PCC as paper filler to improve its properties. \n\nLoading material of PCC with whiskers shape may confer improvements of electric resistance \n\nand elasticity modulus (Cheng et al., 2004; Chen, Qian and An, 2011). Also, Hu et al. (2009) \n\nshowed improvements of the physical and optical properties of the paper when fillers of needle-\n\nshape aragonite were used. \n\nTo better understand how the modification of PCC occurs is the main study of this thesis; \n\nthus, it is important to make a review (Section 2.5) of the research that was already made to \n\nobtain neddle-shape, whisker or lamellar structure. Other aspect to have in consideration is the \n\nuse of the organic additives as CIT and/or sodium citrate (SC) with calcium carbonate to obtain \n\nthe mentioned structures. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.5  Calcium carbonate and Organic Compounds \n \n\nIn the previous work, one of the techniques used to deconstruct the cellulosic matrix of the \n\npaper, to obtain its mineral loading without its degradation, was an enzymatic complex. This \n\ncomplex is activated with the use of SC buffer.  This led to a white dust as residue that was \n\nafter characterized by several methods in which is included FESEM. The obtained pictures \n\nshow a completely different morphology of the original PCC used as loading filler. The residue \n\n\n\n2.Paper and Papermaking \n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\nobtained has lamellar morphology. Thus, it was possible to conclude that the used buffer causes \n\nthe change on the shape of PCC (Carecho, 2016). \n\nTo better understand how the PCC is influenced by the citrate, it is important to have an \n\nidea of the approaches already tested (with citrate or other organic compounds) to obtain the \n\nsame or similar structures, such as needle-shape or other elongated shapes. The application of \n\nthis modified particles on paper is also a point to take into account. Other aspect to have in \n\nconsideration is the use of citrate with calcium carbonate and in which aspects it influences this \n\nmineral. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.5.1 A review \n\n \n\nThe controlled synthesis of calcium carbonate has received much attention due to its wide \n\napplication in many industrial fields, including paper, paint, and plastics production (Geyssant, \n\n2003). As it was said in the previous sections, there are several aspects that can be manipulated \n\nto control the morphology and the properties of the end particles. Numerous researches are \n\nbeing made to study the behaviour of this particular mineral, and some of them will be presented \n\nbelow. A resume of these studies can be found in Table 3. \n\n \n\nMeldrum and Hyde (2001) synthesized calcium carbonate precipitated from saturated \n\nsolutions in the presence of magnesium (Mg) and organic additives (citric and malic acid (MA), \n\nboth known to enhance incorporation of Mg in the calcite lattice). Their aim was to investigate \n\nthe impact in the end particles morphologies mingling Mg with the calcite. The particles \n\nprecipitation was made by the carbonation process, at pH 7 at room temperature and pressure, \n\nand the crystals were grown for ten weeks. The resulted material exhibited a range of shapes of \n\ncalcite and some of them can be pointed out: \n\n- Precipitation in the absence of Mg (only using calcium carbonate and the organic acids): \n\nthe influence of malic and citric acids was very striking. CIT showed a more pronounced affect \n\nin the crystal morphology and growth then the malic acid, while malic acid exerted influence \n\non crystal morphology even at very low concentrations. The final result showed elongated \n\ncrystals with both acids, depending on the concentration used. \n\n- Precipitation in the presence of Mg and organic acids: from this experiment resulted \n\neven more pronounced structural modifications, and once again, CIT exerted a stronger \n\n\n\nNew Precipitated Calcium Carbonate Derived Structures for Application in Papermaking \n\n20 \n\n \n\nmorphological influence. Depending on the concentrations used, it can be highlighted the \n\nappearance of elongated and lamellar crystals. \n\n \n\nTable 3.

The effect of the \n\nconcentration of this organic compounds on the particle size and shape was also observed. Other \n\nprocess conditions were also studied such as feed rate, calcium/carbonate ratio and pH. The \n\nreaction temperature was maintained at 50\u00baC and the pH varied from 9 to 11. The resulted \n\n\n\n2.Paper and Papermaking \n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\nobtained particles presented changes in their morphology depending on the absence or use of \n\nadditives. Without the presence of additives, the obtained material was needle-like shaped. The \n\ncomplexing agents proved to have strong influence on the crystals\u2019 morphology: CIT promotes \n\nthe rhombic structure at pH 10 and a calcium/carbonate ratio of \u00bc, whereas the presence of \n\nEDTA generates mostly spherical particles. \n\n \n\nCheng et al. (2004) studied the crystallization of CaCO3 particles in the absence and \n\npresence of polyacrylic acid (PAA), polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) \n\nand cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), by a solution process. The reaction occurred \n\nat temperatures of 25\u00baC and 80\u00baC, respectively, and pH 10. The resultant solution was allowed \n\nto stand under static conditions for 24h. The reference particles (without any additive) revealed \n\nto be a plate-like aggregate of calcite at 25\u00baC, and rhombohedral at 80\u00baC. This study showed \n\nthat PAA has significant influence on the morphology of CaCO3 at 25\u00baC, forming ellipsoidal \n\nparticles. Also, with the use of CTAB at 80\u00baC, there were obtained aragonite wiskers. PVA \n\ninduced also great modification at 80\u00baC, forming drendrite-shaped aggregates. PEG showed no \n\ninfluence in crystal modification. \n\n \n\nAltay, Shahwan and Tano?lu (2007) investigated the influence of the additives CTAB, \n\nEDTA and polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA) on the morphology of CaCO3 at \n\nvariable temperature (30\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 70\u00baC, and 90\u00baC). The precipitation reaction was made by a \n\nsolution process, at pH 9 and with an aging time of 24h. The effects of these additives were \n\nstudied, showing that the higher temperature has great influence on the particles\u2019 modification. \n\nPDDA additive transforms the original rhombohedral shape into rectangular prism calcite. The \n\nCTAB at lower temperatures forms plate-like crystals, while at higher temperatures promotes \n\nthe formation of branch-like particles. When adding EDTA to the solution, the crystals obtained \n\nare composed by calcite and aragonite and the final morphology at lower temperature is similar \n\nto an apple core; however with the increase of the temperature, the crystal tends to elongate and \n\nat 90\u00baC the particle shape is prismatic rod. \n\n \n\nPark et al. (2008) investigated the effects of the ions Mg2+ and organic additives such as \n\ncitric and malic acid in the synthesis of PCC by the carbonation process. The reaction occurred \n\nat 80\u00baC and controlled pH, and the obtained crystals were filtered and dried for 12h at 80\u00baC. \n\nThe study showed that the crystals\u2019 aspect ratio increases as the concentration of Mg2+ \n\nincreases; also there is an optimal ratio Mg/CIT where the growth of needle-like minerals are \n\n\n\nNew Precipitated Calcium Carbonate Derived Structures for Application in Papermaking \n\n22 \n\n \n\nfavoured. Also, SEM images show needle-like shape well defined when citric or malic acid are \n\nused. The authors also consider that these organic additives may disrupt aragonite formation by \n\nreaction with magnesium ions rather than facilitating calcium carbonate synthesis through \n\nassociation with calcium ions.  \n\n \n\nWang et al. (2009) obtained lamellar aragonite by using sodium stearate (SS) as additive \n\nin the solution process of precipitation of CaCO3. The reaction occurred at 60 \u00baC for 15h. After \n\nthis time, the precipitate was washed and dried for one day at 80 \u00baC. This additive was proven \n\nto not only modify the morphology of the precipitated aragonite, but also to increase its \n\nhydrophobicity.  \n\n \n\nChen and Xiang (2009) synthesized CaCO3 polymorphs with double injection of CaCl2 and \n\nNH4HCO3 solutions without any additive. The temperatures used in this study vary from 30\u00baC \n\nto 80\u00baC. The resulted material was dried at 105\u00baC for 12h. The study of the influence of the \n\ntemperature on the shape of the particles revealed that at 30\u00baC mushroom-like lamellar \n\naggregates are formed, and with the increasing of the temperature the material\u2019s shape tends to \n\nbe more lamellar; at 80\u00baC rod-like products were obtained. It was also noticed that the values \n\nof [??3\n?2]/[??+2] decreased with the increase of temperature, and the authors say that this fact \n\ncould be one of the reasons for the difference between the shapes formed at 30-40\u00baC and at \n\n80\u00baC. \n\n \n\nHu et al. (2009) reported the synthesis of needle-like aragonite directly from GCC using a \n\nreversible reaction between magnesium chloride (MgCl2) aqueous solution and GCC. The \n\ncalcination process was not used in this case. The reaction occurs at the synthesis temperature \n\nof aragonite, 70\u00baC. The crystals were aged at room temperature for 2h. \n\nThe same authors (Hu et al., 2009) introduced these same particles as paper fillers to \n\nevaluate the strength of the paper. Their results showed improvements in some paper properties \n\nsuch as tensile strength and folding endurance, when compared with paper using commercial \n\nPCC. The stiffness of the sheets on the machine direction was increased. This experiment \n\nrevealed that the price of the paper can be decreased even when the loading with needle-like \n\naragonite is increased. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n2.Paper and Papermaking \n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\n2.5.2 Citric acid/ sodium citrate influence on calcium carbonate \n\n \n\nThe influence of CIT and its salt on calcium carbonate particles is not yet fully understood. \n\nHowever, there are some characteristics such as its low toxicity that make CIT one of the \n\norganic acids most used widely. The reaction of organic acids with carbonate compounds is \n\ncomplex due to its reversibility and for being thermodynamically limited by the presence of \n\nreaction products (Chatelain, Silberberg and Schechter, 1976). \n\nCIT has three carboxylic (COOH) and one hydroxyl (OH) groups, which have a great \n\nimportance in its reactions. Figure 6  shows CIT and SC molecules, respectively. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn the presence of calcium ions, CIT behaves as a sequestering or as a chelation agent, \n\nresulting water-soluble or water-insoluble compounds, respectively. This depends on some \n\nfactors such as the ionic strength, pH, and temperature of the mixture. \n\nSome researchers had studied the behaviour of this carboxylic acid with calcium carbonate, \n\nmainly when used in the precipitation process (Reddy and Hoch, 2001; Wada, Kanamura and \n\nUmegaki, 2001; Westin and Rasmuson, 2003; Karar, Naamoune and Kahoul, 2016). One aspect \n\nin common in these studies is that CIT acts as a growth inhibitor during the crystallization step, \n\nand this phenomenon increases with the increasing of the concentration of CIT. Wada, \n\nKanamura and Umegaki (2001) suggested that this inhibition capacity may be dependent on the \n\ncarboxylic groups, by their adsorption onto the calcium carbonate particles. This mechanism \n\nmay also contribute to the modification of the characteristic morphology of calcite crystals. The \n\nsame study say that the bond between carboxylate ions (from the carboxylic acids) and free \n\nCa2+ of the calcium carbonate surface, may lead to the increase of the particles hydrophobicity. \n\nKarar, Naamoune and Kahoul (2016) also studied the effect of mixing CIT and SC with \n\nCaCO3. As this mixture has two inhibitors, the chelation capacity for calcium ions is higher \n\nthan the one with the two organic compounds used separately. This causes the increase of the \n\nnucleation time and the crystal size reduction. In this study, the formation of calcium citrate \n\n(Ca3(C6H5O7)2 ? 4H2O) is also described. The deprotonation of CIT in the presence of SC \n\nchelate with Ca2+ forms a calcium-CIT complex, Figure 7. \n\nFigure 6.

At 25\u00baC, \n\nfor CIT these values are pKa1=3.13, pKa2=4.76, pKa3=6.4 and pKa4=11.6 (Al-Khaldi et al., \n\n2007). The ionic distribution of CIT as function of pH is plotted in Figure 8  (Al-Khaldi et al., \n\n2003). This shows that when CIT is dissolved in water, its pH is in the range 1.7-2.1. With the \n\nincreasing of pH, the carboxylic groups are released from the molecule, being free to accept the \n\ncalcium ions in the solution, as concluded by Karar, Naamoune and Kahoul (2016). \n\nThus, as the pH value increases, more CIT (?3???), di-hydrogen (?2???\n?), and mono-\n\nhydrogen (????2?) citrate ions are ionized to produce citrate ions (???3?) at pH greater \n\nthan 6. \n\nFigure 7. Calcium-Citric Acid complex.

Then the di-hydrogen citrate ions capture the calcium ions and form a \n\ncalcium-CIT complex (Reaction 2.9)) (Al-Khaldi et al., 2007). \n\n \n\n2?+ +????3 ? ??\n2+ + ?2? + ??2 ?

In fact, (Carecho, 2016) reported that at this point of the reaction, the \n\nwhite suspension of PCC with SC turned transparent, turning white again after a few minutes - \n\ncorresponding to the dissolution and posterior precipitation of calcium citrate. \n\n \n\n??2+ +2(???2???\n+)(??)  ? ??3(???)2 (?) ? + 4?\n\n+ (2.10) \n\n \n\nThe formed calcium complex is insoluble in water and its solubility is not strongly \n\ndependent of the temperature, since as the temperature increases the solubility value is slightly \n\nincreased (Apelblat, 1993). \n\nSince the calcium citrate precipitation depends on the pH value, the presence of CO2 is an \n\nimportant factor: CO2 dissolves in water, forming carbonic acid (H2CO3) which reacts with \n\nCaCO3 (Reaction 2.11 and 2.12). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8.

(2.13) \n\n \n\nAs the 2nd proton of CIT is being released, CO2 is being formed allowing the formation \n\nof carbonic acid with the reaction with water. The di-hydrogen citrate ions accept the free \n\ncalcium ions, forming a calcium-CIT complex. The formation of carbonic acid seems to prevent \n\nthe 3rd citric acid proton from spending. Since the 1st proton of carbonic acid has a pKa of 6.35, \n\nand the 3rd proton of CIT has a pKa of 6.4, the system is buffered around these pH values, due \n\nto the protons\u2019 competition. As the CIT concentration increases, the pH lowers, and its protons \n\nhave a dominant effect. Thus, the release of the 3rd proton is promoted, and consequently the \n\nmolecule can accept the calcium ions, forming the calcium citrate molecule (Al-Khaldi et al., \n\n2007 and Al-Khaldi et al., 2003). \n\nHowever, in none of these investigations is referred the formation of lamellar structures \n\ndue to the reaction of calcium carbonate with CIT or SC. A more detailed study must be made \n\nto understand how the lamellar particles are originated in the presence of SC. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n3.Materials and Methods \n\n \n\n27 \n\n \n\n3 Materials and Methods \n \n\nThe aim of this dissertation, as previously referred, is to study the modifications on the \n\nscalenohedral PCC morphology when it is in contact with citrate buffer. The final mineral has \n\na lamellar shape, and it is not yet understood the mechanism that originates this kind of \n\nstructure. Thus, as starting point, the experimental protocol used in the complementary study \n\nmade by Carecho (2016) was reproduced, and used as reference (Appendix A. I). After this, \n\nsome process modifications were made in order to optimize the logistic of the reaction and \n\nreduce its time as well. To assess how the reaction conditions can enhance the formation of \n\nlamellar particles, a pH study was made, maintaining the temperature that was initially used. \n\nThe influence of the ratio of CIT/PCC was also investigated. \n\nThe next step concerns the characterization of the obtained particles and posteriorly their \n\napplication as coating pigment. The printing quality of the coated paper was evaluated. The \n\nbehaviour of these particles used as paper filler with a content of 30% was also studied by the \n\ndetermination of paper properties. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.1  PCC modification with sodium citrate buffer \n \n\nThis procedure is fairly simple and the reaction preparation starts by adding PCC (2 g) \n\nand ultrapure water (50 mL) in a 400 mL beaker. After, the mixture undergoes vigorous \n\nmagnetic stirring with gradual heating up to 50 \u00baC. The citrate buffer 1M and pH 4.5 \n\n(preparation process in Appendix A. II.) is added until the reaction pH reaches 5.5, measured \n\nat 50 \u00baC. The addition of the buffer must be done slowly and the amount needed is about 40 mL \n\n(~ 8.4 g of CIT). \n\nWhen the reaction conditions are reached, the mixture remains under stirring for 1h. \n\nAfter this time, the mixture is poured into falcon tubes to proceed the centrifugation step in the \n\nHettich Universal 32 equipment. The centrifugation must be done for 20 minutes and at 4500 \n\nrpm. This process should be repeated three times with two intermediated washes with distillate \n\nwater. \n\nThe obtained solid residue is after dried in the oven (Scientific series 9000) at 40 \u00baC \n\nuntil it is completely dry. Usually the drying stage requires one day, and to be more efficient \n\nthe residue can be transferred to petri dishes, however some material may be lost. After, the \n\ndried material is grinded into a uniform dust and stored in a suitable recipient. \n\n\n\nNew Precipitated Calcium Carbonate Derived Structures for Application in Papermaking \n\n28 \n\n \n\nThe industrial PCC used was provided by the research center RAIZ, and the reactants \n\nused were NaOH in pellets and CIT monohydrate. \n\n \n\n3.1.1 pH and Ratio CIT/PCC study \n\n \n\nTo investigate the origin of the lamellar morphology with the use of SC buffer, some \n\nvariables were changed from the reference procedure. Thus, there were four points in study: \n\n- The influence of the buffer\u2019s pH and consequently the pH of the obtained \n\nsuspension; \n\n- The CIT/PCC ratio; \n\n- The use of CIT in the absence of NaOH; \n\n- The use of GCC instead of the PCC in the original procedure. \n\nIn order to have a better control of the CIT/PCC ratio, new protocols were created: \n\n- A solution of CIT (1M) were prepared and poured drop-to-drop into the PCC \n\nsuspension. When the reaction conditions are reached the pH is measured at 50 \u00baC \n\n(Appendix A. IV); \n\n-  Two different solutions were prepared, CIT 1M and NaOH 1M, and then poured \n\nseparately drop-by-drop into the PCC suspension, until the pretended ratio/pH is \n\nreached. After, the pH of the final suspension is measured at 50\u00baC. A detailed \n\ndescription of this procedure can be found in Appendix A. V. \n\nTherefore, the three procedures can be identified as: \n\na) SC 1M added to the PCC suspension and obtained in two different ways: \n\na.1) by using a solution of NaOH 0.1 M until a pH of 4.5 \n\na.2) by using pellets of NaOH until the required pH was reached \n\nb) Addition of CIT (1M) \n\nc) Addition of CIT (1M) and NaOH (1M) to the PCC suspension. \n\nTable 4 resumes the experiments that were made.

IV. \n\n \n\nAfter the reproduction of the reference protocol, the next objective was to test the \n\ninfluence of a citrate buffer with a high pH (S3). S4 was performing with the aim to test the \n\ninfluence of the absence of NaOH and lowering the CIT/PCC ratio, to produce a more economic \n\ncompound. \n\nS5, S6 and S7, followed the same protocol. Though, in S5 the suspension was kept at \n\npH 8 to a ratio of CIT/PCC half of the reference, to test once again the influence of pH in the \n\nfinal suspension. S6 and S7 were made to evaluate the CIT/PCC ratio, maintaining the same \n\npH as the reference. \n\nTo have a parallel with S5, the S8 experiment was made, where the starting protocol \n\nwas the same as the reference. \n\nS9 was tested to evaluate which amount of CIT was needed to reach the pH 5.5 to further \n\nevaluate if that amount was the needed to form lamellar morphology. \n\nAs in all the previous experiments the amount of citrate (or CIT) was in excess relatively \n\nto the amount of calcium carbonate, experiment 10 was made, in which stoichiometric amounts \n\nwere used. \n\nTo have an approach of the CIT pKa, the citrate buffer of S11 was prepared in order to \n\nhave a pH of 6, corresponding to the realising of the 2nd proton of the acid (as study in Section \n\n2.5). The influence of other pKa were also tested in S3, and S4.  \n\nFinally, the starting material was changed to GCC. S12 follows the same protocol as S2, \n\nand S13 has the same procedure as S10. \n\n\n\nNew Precipitated Calcium Carbonate Derived Structures for Application in Papermaking \n\n30 \n\n \n\n3.1.2 Characterization of the obtained particles \n\n \n\nThe characterization step has the utmost importance since it can give a more detailed \n\ndescription about the particles that are being studied, and a comparison between the original \n\nand the modified particles can be made. For such purpose several techniques were used, such \n\nas Microscopy for particle visualization (size and shape), laser diffraction for particle size, Zeta \n\nPotential for surface charge and Thermogravimetric Analysis and Calcination for \n\ndecomposition rates. \n\n \n\n \n\n Optical Microscopy (OM) \n\nThe optical microscope is an instrument that, with the help of a system of lenses, allows \n\nthe magnification of small samples using visible light. This equipment consists of mechanical \n\ncomponent and an optical component. The mechanic part supports and controls the optical part, \n\nand the latter promotes the images\u2019 enlargement. This equipment can provide a first approach \n\nto the sample in study, giving an idea of its shape and size. \n\nThe microscope used in this characterization was the Olympus BH2 and it was connected \n\nto a system with a camera (Color View III) and a digital programme (Analysis 5) through which \n\nthe samples can be seen. \n\nOnly the particles that apparently had a lamellar shape were chosen to continue with the \n\ncharacterization process. \n\n \n\n \n\n Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) \n\nThe principle of this technique is based on the emission of an electron beam, through \n\nmagnetic lenses that bombards the surface of the dried conductive sample. As a result, \n\nsecondary electrons are emitted from each point of the object and are captured by a detector. \n\nThus, by the decoding of the energy emitted by the electrons, it is possible to reproduce virtual \n\nimages of the sample\u2019s surface. With this method, it is possible to understand some \n\ncharacteristics of the material as its size, its morphology and its topography (Dedavid, Gomes \n\nand Machado, 2007; Alyamani and Lemine, 2012). \n\nThe tests were performed in the LED&amp;MAT laboratory of the Instituto Pedro Nunes \n\n(IPN) and the equipment used was the Zeiss Gemini 2 Merlin Compact/VP Compact, Field \n\nEmission Scanning Electron Microscopy. The samples were placed into a carbon tape and \n\nidentified. In this analysis the samples were not coated with gold, as it would normally be done. \n\n\n\n3.Materials and Methods \n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\nThe aim of the coating is to help the conduction of the electrons and hence making possible to \n\nachieve an image with better resolution. There were obtained pictures with magnifications of \n\n20000x, 7500x and 3500x. To improve the sharpness and the definition of the obtained image, \n\nit was introduced an inert gas above the sample during its collection. \n\nWith this analysis it was possible to confirm the real shape of the particles in study and \n\nonly the particles with lamellar morphology were chosen to continue with the characterization \n\nstage.  \n\n \n\n \n\n Calcination at 900 \u00baC \n\nThe calcination at 900 \u00baC has the aim of decomposing the inorganic material present in the \n\nsamples, causing the degradation of CaCO3 into CaO, as described in Reaction 3.1. \n\n \n\n????3  ? ??? +??2 (3.1) \n\n \n\nThis technique was used to chemically characterize the samples, since its composition is still \n\nunknown. The original PCC and the modified particles were placed in the oven until it reaches \n\n525 \u00baC to make sure that all the organics were decomposed. The weight was registered and the \n\nparticles were placed once again in the oven for 14h up to 900 \u00baC. The protocol used followed \n\nthe standard TAPPI 413. \n\n \n\n \n\nThermogravimetric analysis/differential scanning calorimetry (TGA/DSC) \n\nThis analysis allows the evaluation of the thermal stability of a sample and the amount \n\nof organic and inorganic parts present on it. The principle of TGA is related the weight changes \n\nin a sample as function of the temperature and time in a controlled atmosphere and the obtained \n\nresults gives an idea of the material composition. The DSC is based on the measurement of the \n\nheat flow rate from a sample to obtain thermal critical points of the substances (Linseis, 2012a, \n\n2012b). The equipment used was a TA Instruments SDTQ600, and approximately 10g of each \n\nsample were added to the pan and submitted to a 10 \u00baC/min heating rate, from room temperature \n\nto 900 \u00baC. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nNew Precipitated Calcium Carbonate Derived Structures for Application in Papermaking \n\n32 \n\n \n\n Laser Diffraction Spectrometry (LDS) \n\nThe aim of this technique is to measure the particle size distribution of the sample. The \n\noperation method consists in passing the particles through a focus laser beam. The light is \n\nscattered by the dispersed particles at an angle that is inversely proportional to their size and \n\nphotosensitive detectors measure its angular intensity. Knowing the material\u2019s refraction index \n\nand the dispersing medium, it is possible to convert the diffraction pattern into the size \n\ndistribution, with the Lorenz-Mie theory. However, even though the particles may present \n\nirregular shapes, the LDS considers that the particles have spherical shape, defining the results \n\nas equivalent spherical diameter. \n\nFor the LDS measurement, the sample needs to be previously prepared. For that, a \n\nsuspension of 1wt% of the material is made, where about three drops of dispersing agent \n\n(ammonium polycarbonate 6 % (v/v), Targon\u00ae 1128) was added before adding the water. The \n\nsuspension was subjected to magnetic stirring for 20 minutes and then placed in a sonication \n\nbath (50 kHz) for 15 minutes. After this time, the measurement can be done by adding a small \n\nvolume of the suspension to a 700 mL of water in the equipment vessel until reaching an \n\nobscuration around 10 \u2013 20%. The measurement was carried out under stirring (2000 rpm). \n\nThe analysis was done in the Malvern Instruments\u2019 Mastersizer 2000 that allows the \n\nmeasurement of particle sizes between 0.02 and 2000 \u00b5m. \n\n \n\n \n\nElectrophoretic Light Scattering (ELS) \n\nThe ELS allows the measurement of the surface charge of the particles in an aqueous \n\nmedium. In this technique, the particles in suspension are subjected to an electric field that \n\nmakes them move with a velocity related with their zeta potential (?). This value is a measure \n\nof the attraction-repulsion magnitude between the particles. A higher potential zeta represents \n\na higher stability of the suspension. Charged particles repel themselves and this prevents the \n\nnatural tendency of aggregation between particles. \n\nThe sample needs to be prepared before its analysis, with a similar protocol used in the \n\nLDS. However, the dispersant agent is not added and the suspension here is about 0.1 wt% to \n\nobtain results of good quality. \n\nTo perform this analysis, a Malvern Instruments\u2019 Zetasizer Nano ZS was used, and the zeta \n\npotential was evaluated at the environmental room temperature with an equilibrium time of 120 \n\nseconds.  \n\n \n\n\n\n3.Materials and Methods \n\n \n\n33 \n\n \n\n3.2  Coating and Printing Quality \n \n\nAfter the characterization, the modified PCC particles were applied as coating pigment \n\nover printing and writing paper produced from a bleached Kraft pulp from Eucaliptus Globulus, \n\nwith a basis weight of 80 g/m2 \u2013 namely paper base (PB). The coating properties and printing \n\nquality were evaluated in RAIZ.  \n\n \n\n3.2.1 Coating Process \n\nThe coating suspension is made with cationic starch (12 wt%) previously prepared \n\n(Appendix B. I.), the modified PCC particles, a few drops of dispersing agent and a small \n\namount of water.  \n\nThe suspension had the formulation described in Table 5. \n\n \n\nTable 5. Formulation of the coating suspension \n\nAdditives Quantity (g) \n\nStarch suspension (12 wt%) 12.5 \n\nPCC 3 \n\nDispersing agent (Targon \u00ae) 0.25 \n\nWater 2 \u2013 4 mL \n\n \n\nTo prepare the coating suspension, the PCC particles are inserted in a beaker, and then \n\ndrops of dispersant are added. After, the water must be added drop-by-drop while the operator \n\nblends the mixture with a stirring rod until a paste is formed. This mixture should not be too \n\nfluid. The next step is the addition of the starch suspension. The final suspension must be stirred \n\nmagnetically until a uniform mixture is obtained. \n\nTo perform the coating stage, 5 mL of the suspension are taken from the beaker with a \n\nplastic syringe and then poured along the applicator rod of the bench coating equipment. The \n\ncoating equipment is a Mathis SVA-IR-B, which operates at different speeds of the applicator \n\nrod. The rod used was smooth with a diameter of 0.15 mm. \n\nThe drying process of the coated papers is divided in two stages: first, the IR-dryer dries \n\nthe coating layer at the same time as it is done, and then the coated paper is exposed to the room \n\nair for some time. \n\n\n\nNew Precipitated Calcium Carbonate Derived Structures for Application in Papermaking \n\n34 \n\n \n\nThe formulation and the process used are the same for the modified particles. There were \n\nmade at least two duplicates for each type of particles. The coated papers were cut into an A4 \n\nsheet and the \u2018pick-up\u2019 was determined in RAIZ. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.2 Coating Properties \n\nAfter the \u2018pick-up\u2019 determination, two properties of the coated paper were evaluated: its \n\nair permeability and roughness. The air permeability was done by the Gurley\u2019s method (ISO \n\n5636-5), in which the time that takes 100 mL of air flow to pass through the paper sheet is \n\nmeasured, using the Gurley SE 121 equipment. The Bendsten method (ISO 8791-2) was used \n\nto measure the air flow that passes in between a circular head and the paper surface, giving in \n\nthis way the roughness of the paper. This test was performed in the equipment L&amp;W Bendtsen. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.3 Printing Quality \n\nTo perform the printing quality analysis, a test mask (Figure 9) was printed in each of the \n\ncoated paper. This was made with a HP PhotoSmart B8850-IJTarget 13 in its best printing \n\nquality mode. To evaluate the quality parameters, the spectrophotometers X-Rite i1 and QEA \n\nPIASII were used (Figure 9). \n\nThe optical density of the colours black, magenta, cyan, and yellow was measured with the \n\nX-Rite i1 to determine the gamut area and volume. The print-through and show-through was \n\nalso calculated with the help of this equipment. \n\nThe QEA PIASII was used to determine the line raggedness, the black and white feathering, \n\nand colour-to-colour bleed. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9. HP PhotoSmart printing quality test mask \n\n\n\n3.Materials and Methods \n\n \n\n35 \n\n \n\n3.2.4 Coating characterization \n\nAfter the printing quality analysis, the coated papers with the highest values of gamut area \n\nwere analysed by image analysis SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope). The resulting images \n\nfrom this technique result from a scan made by a beam of electron to the samples\u2019 surface. The \n\nelectrons interact with the atoms of the sample, sending back signals with information of the \n\ntopography of the sample. \n\nThe analysis was performed in University of Aveiro in the equipment Hitachi (S4100) at \n\n15 kV, with double deposition of carbon.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3 Paper Testing \n \n\nAfter the modification of the PCC particles and their characterization, besides the testing \n\nas coating pigment, they were also used as paper filler. For that, there were made handsheets \n\nand later their characterization. These procedures were performed in RAIZ, where it is available \n\nall the needed equipment. \n\n \n\n3.3.1 Production of Handsheets \n\nBefore the sheets production, the first thing to do is to prepare the raw material and the \n\nadditives needed to the production of P&amp;W paper. The fiber used was previously refined in a \n\nconical refiner and having a Schopper-Riegle of 32. \n\nIn order to reduce the loss of additives during the paper formation, an aqueous solution of \n\na retention agent (0.025 wt%) was used: cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM) with the commercial \n\nname Percol\u00ae. The sizing agent used was the alkenyl succinic anhydride (ASA) that was later \n\nadded to a starch suspension 2.5% (wt%). Finally, an aqueous suspension (1 wt%) with the \n\nmineral loading was made. The procedures of these suspensions can be found in Appendix C. \n\nI \u2013 III. \n\nThe mixing of the enumerated compounds has to comply with the mixing times that are \n\npreviously established. Those times can be found in Table 6 as well as the amount of fiber and \n\nadditives needed to obtain a sheet with a weight of 1.6 g and a grammage of 80 g/m2. To \n\naccomplish this task, an adequate equipment is needed, the batch handsheet former MARVI \n\n(model 255/SA). \n\nAll the protocols related with the sheets formation, pressing and conditioning are described \n\nin Appendix D. \n\n\n\nNew Precipitated Calcium Carbonate Derived Structures for Application in Papermaking \n\n36 \n\n \n\nTable 6.

For that, the formed sheets were calcined at 525 \u00baC, for16h as described in \n\nthe standard TAPPI 211. During this procedure, the organic matter of a certain amount of paper \n\nis decomposed remaining at the end only the inorganics. After this determination, it was \n\npossible to calculate the filler that was retained in each sheet. This procedure was made in \n\nduplicate to each kind of sheets with different fillers. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nNew precipitated calcium carbonate derived for application in papermaking \n\n \n\n38 \n\n \n\n4 Results and Discussion \n \n\nIn this section, the results obtained by the characterization techniques described in Chapter \n\n3 will be analysed and discussed. The order of presentation will be the same as previously \n\npresented: first, an approach to the characterization of the original PCC and the modified \n\nparticles will be made, and subsequently an evaluation of their effect as coating pigment and as \n\npaper filler. \n\n \n\n4.1. Particles Characterization \n\n \n\nThe characterization of the original PCC and the modified particles was made in order to \n\nknow their morphology, composition, size and surface charge. \n\n \n\n4.1.1 Morphology \n\n \n\nOptical Microscopy \n\nThe first attempting approach to analyse the morphology of the materials that were \n\nmodified was made with the help of an optical microscope. Besides the low definition of the \n\npictures, the particle\u2019s morphology can be noticed. In Table 8 are resumed the obtained \n\nmorphologies for each reaction and the correspondent pictures can be found in Appendix E. I. \n\nThe sample obtained by Carecho (2016) will be taken as reference (S0, Figure 10) to \n\nevaluate the morphology of the particles posteriorly produced. Thus, it is possible to observed \n\nthat lamellar shapes were obtained in the samples S1, S2 (Figure 10), S4, S9, S10, S11, S12, \n\nS13. However, the size of the particles is different from one another. S4, S9, S11, S13 presented \n\na smaller dimension when compared with S0. The samples S6 and S7 present a higher aspect \n\nratio and a morphology of what appears to be needle-type. S8 showed some lamellar particles, \n\nbut it also had a high number of spherical particles. S3 and S5 showed to have spherical \n\nmorphology. \n\nThe reactions of the particles presented in Figure 10 have the same protocol in terms of \n\nreaction conditions, although there were made some modifications in the process logistic. In S0 \n\nit was used mechanical stirring with the use of a blade agitator, while S2 undergo magnetic \n\nstirring. This can explain the broken aspect noticed in S0, compared with S2. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n4.Results and Discussion \n\n39 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe influence of the pH is very noticeable in this analysis. It can be pointed out that the \n\nCIT/PCC ratio is an important factor, since it influences the pH of the final suspension. Thus, \n\nthis parameter is determinant in the formation of lamellar morphology. Suspensions with high \n\npH (> 8) resulted in particles with spherical shape. The lamellar morphology is obtained at pH \n\n5.5, and the CIT/PCC ratio can be adjusted depending on the protocol used. \n\nTable 8.

Reference particles, S0 (right) and its reproduced protocol, S2 (left). Magnification 50x. \n\n\n\nNew precipitated calcium carbonate derived for application in papermaking \n\n \n\n40 \n\n \n\nIn the absence of NaOH, particles with lamellar morphology are also formed but for \n\nCIT/PCC > 1.5 it is noticeable a high size reduction. This can indicate that the solution of CIT \n\nis degrading the particles of PCC. \n\nTo proceed with the characterization stage, the particles with spherical morphology were \n\ndiscarded, as well as lamellar particles with small size. Also, since S6 and S7 were performed \n\nwith the same protocol and presented the same morphology, the one that had higher CIT/PCC \n\nratio was also discarded. \n\nThus, the particles selected were S2 (reproduction of the reaction made by Carecho (2016)), \n\nS6 (from the new protocol but with lower CIT/PCC ratio and the same pH as S2), S10 \n\n(stoichiometric CIT/PCC ratio) and S12 (same protocol as S2 however, instead using PCC, \n\nGCC was used) and these were analysed by FESEM. \n\n \n\n \n\nReaction behaviour \n\nTo perform the coating and paper application there were produced more particles from the \n\nchosen samples. The yield of each reaction was calculated taking into account the amount of \n\nsolids added in the beginning of the reactions and the obtained dried solid content. It can be \n\nfound in Appendix E. II. The yield of the process varies mostly because of the centrifugation \n\nstep, since in this stage there is high weight loss during the washing step.   \n\nWith the new replicas of the reaction, it was noticed that the effective ratio of S12 is less \n\nthe 6.3; the CIT/PCC ratio is in fact ca. 4. This means that the stirring must be vigorous to \n\noptimize the interaction between the reactants. \n\nCarecho (2016) reported that when the SC is being added and the suspension reaches pH \n\n6, there is a colour change of the mixture (from white to transparent), meaning its dissolution. \n\nAfter ca. 10 minutes the suspension precipitates and the original white colour appears. The \n\nsame phenomenon was observed during these experimental procedures, but only when protocol \n\na) was used, even when the starting material is GCC. However, since the lamellar morphology \n\nwas originated with the other protocols, this phenomenon may not be an important factor to \n\nobtain the desired modification.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n4.Results and Discussion \n\n41 \n\n \n\nFESEM \n\nTo take a closer look on the particles morphology, the selected particles were subjected to \n\nFESEM analyses. To have a comparative image (Figure 11 a)), the research group provided to \n\nthis work the SEM pictures of the original PCC. As it is possible to see, the original PCC used \n\nhas a rosette morphology, characteristic of scalenohedral PCC. The modifications to this PCC \n\nresulted in lamellar particles, as expected. Figure 12 show the obtained modified particles S2, \n\nS6, S10 and S12 with magnification of 20 000x. The low definition of the pictures is due to the \n\nlack of particle coating with gold when the FESEM analysis was made. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIt is possible to observe the sharpness of lamellar particles S2 (a). S6 and S10 ((b) and c)) \n\npresent also lamellar morphology although with higher aspect ratio. \n\nThe modified GCC (S12) can be compared with the SEM images (Figure 11 b)) of the \n\nGCC used by Sequeira (2014), the same starting material used in this work. The original GCC \n\nhas a rhombohedral morphology and from the modification with the citrate buffer resulted \n\nparticles with sharped edges, and a more platy structure. \n\nAppendix E. III. contains images of the modified particles with other magnifications. \n\nThere, it is revealed an unevenness of particle size distribution. Also, it can be seen that for \n\nS12, not all the particles presented sharp edges; some particles have rounded morphology \n\nsimilar to a coin. In the same appendix, the SEM images of S4 and S11 are also presented. The \n\nimages confirm the lamellar morphology of S4, and it is notorious the low dimension of the \n\nparticles, meaning that the action of CIT itself forms lamellar shapes but also disrupt them. On \n\nthe other hand, S11 analysis show scalenohedral morphology, meaning that the optical \n\nmicroscopy analysis was not very accurate. These images reinforce the importance of the pH \n\nof the final suspension into the modification morphology \u2013 in a low pH lamellae are formed, \n\nbut the aspect ratio of que particles is low; a high pH do not contribute to lamellae formation. \n\n \n\na) b) \n\nFigure 11. a) SEM image from the original PCC.

The weight loss of the original PCC is about 43% (in the range of temperatures \n\nbetween 580 and 900 \u00baC) which corresponds to about 97 wt% of CaCO3. The weight loss of ca. \n\n3% is related to the impurities that the PCC may contain.  \n\nThe TGA curves of the modified particles can be seen in Figure 14. The results presented \n\nare normalized, since the first approach revealed high percentage of water in the samples \n\n(Appendix F. IV). For this reason, the curves were changed in order to remove the highest \n\npercentage of water from the given weight loss values.  \n\nFigure 12.

In the literature review (Section 2.), it \n\nwas described that some authors studied the reaction of calcium carbonate with citrate resulting \n\n??3(?6?5?7)2 ? 4?2? as reaction product. The TGA curves of the modified particles are \n\nsimilar to those presented by Zhou et al. (1998) and Radfarnia and Iliuta (2013), suggesting \n\nthat the resulted particles are actually composed by calcium citrate. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 13.

Having in mind \n\nthat some percentage of water was already released, the steps can be described as: \n\n- Stage I, from 105\u00baC to 380 \u00baC: the steps of weight loss are related to the release of water \n\nmolecules from ??3(?6?5?7)2 ? 4?2?.

(4.3) \n\n \n\n- Stage IV, temperatures higher than 800 \u00baC: all carbon produced is burned off. \n\nTable 9 compiles the weight loss in each stage. It can be highlighted that, as its \n\nthermograms, S2 and S10, present similar behaviour. \n\nTable 10 presents the amount of calcium citrate and CaCO3 presented in the samples.

The particles were \n\nsubjected to temperatures up to 900 \u00baC to make sure that all the calcium carbonate is \n\ndecomposed in CaO and CO2. This method is not very accurate, since the weight loss is \n\ndetermined by weighing after cooling in the desiccator, allowing a small percentage of the air \n\nhumidity to be absorbed into the particles. For this reason, duplicates were made and then an \n\naverage value was determined. \n\nTable 11 shows the obtained percentage of weight presented in the temperature intervals \n\nin the calcination process and the percentage of CaCO3 in the particles.

As said in Section 2, the performed \n\nreactions form a complex calcium-CIT, so it cannot be treated as pure CaCO3. Mansour (1994) \n\nreported the decomposition of calcium citrate up to 900 \u00baC, and described several step \n\ndecomposition reaction \u2013 also presented in the Section 4.1.2. Therefore, the percentage of \n\nCaCO3 in the modified particles is calculated taking into account the reactions stoichiometric \n\ncoefficients, as illustrated in Equation 4.1.: \n\n \n\n??3(?6?5?7)2  \n? (105?525 ?)\n?          2 ????3  \n\n? (525?900 ?)\n?           3 ??? (4.4) \n\n \n\n \n\nThe degradation of CaCO3 occurs from 570 \u00baC to 800 \u00baC, so the calculations for the original \n\nPCC and the modified particles follow these equations: \n\n- Original PCC:  \n\n% (? ?) ????3 = [?????? ???? (525 \u00b0? ?900 \u00b0?)]\u00d7\n100.1\n\n44\n?  (4.1) \n\n \n\nWhere 100.1 g/mol is the molecular weight of CaCO3 and 44 g/mol the molecular weight \n\nof CO2. \n\n \n\n- Modified Particles: \n\n% (? ?) ????3 = [?????? ???? (525 \u00b0? ?900 \u00b0?)]\u00d7\n2 \u00d7100.1\n\n3 \u00d756\n?  (4.2) \n\n \n\nWhere 100.1 g/mol is the molecular weight of CaCO3, 56 g/mol the molecular weight of \n\nCaO, and 2 and 3 the respective stoichiometric coefficients, as presented by the reactions 4.1 \u2013 \n\n4.3.  \n\nIt is possible to see that the modified particles lose more than half of its weight during this \n\nprocess. The major weight loss observed for these particles is in the interval of temperatures \n\n105 \u00baC \u2013 525 \u00baC. These values correspond probably to the degradation of the calcium citrate \n\nand other compounds formed in each reaction. The modified samples only have about 38 \u2013 22% \n\nof CaCO3 in their composition (similar to those values obtained with the thermogravimetric \n\nanalysis), meaning that the remain percentage corresponds to those same compounds. The \n\namount of calcium citrate was not calculated using the same approach since the degradation of \n\nthe complex at high temperatures is more complex than the one that happens in PCC. \n\n \n\n\n\n4.Results and Discussion \n\n47 \n\n \n\nTable 11.

This method is only used to make a comparison between particles, \n\nsince the measurement in the equipment is given in terms of diameter, considering the particles \n\nas spheres. For each sample, two measurements were made and the values presented are an \n\naverage of the obtained ones. \n\nFigure 15 shows the size distribution of the particles in study. For S2, S6 and S10 (a), b) \n\nand c)), the comparison was made having into account the starting material used. For S12 (d), \n\nthis comparison was not made since the starting material of this reaction was not characterized. \n\nHowever, in a future work this characterization should be made. For comparison between the \n\nmodified and the original GCC, it will be taken as reference the result from Sequeira (2014). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 15. PCC and modified samples particle size distribution. a) S2, b) S6, c) S10 and d) S12. \n\n\n\nNew precipitated calcium carbonate derived for application in papermaking \n\n \n\n48 \n\n \n\nThe sized distribution of the PCC particles has a bimodal behaviour. Besides the use of a \n\nparticles dispersant, stables aggregates are formed. Thus, the first peak corresponds to the range \n\nof sizes of the individual particles and the second one is related with the stable aggregates \n\nformed. The modified particles do not have the same kind of distribution as the PCC, with \n\nexception of S2, and the volume fraction needed for their analysis is less than the needed for \n\nPCC. It is possible to observe that the modified particles are smaller than the PCC.  \n\nThe behaviour of S6 is not clear, as it has three distinct peaks, and the highest one \n\ncorresponds to a majority of particles with diameter higher than 10 ?m. S10 and S12 have two \n\ndistinct peaks in the range of particles diameter of 1 ?m and 10 ?m. Sequeira (2014) reported \n\nthat the original GCC has a unimodal distribution, which is different from the modified sample \n\nS12.   \n\nTo better understand the dimension of the particles, Table 12 presents the range of the \n\nparticle sizes in the different samples. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 12. Particles diameters \n\nSample dp10 (?m) dp50 (?m) dp90 (?m) \n\nPCC 0.96 4.30 7.83 \n\nS2 1.09 3.37 11.9 \n\nS6 0.98 6.36 55.8 \n\nS10 0.64 3.54 11.1 \n\nS12 0.95 3.77 12.0 \n\n \n\nAs it was observed by the SEM images, S6 has particles with very different sizes. This is \n\ncorroborated with the behaviour of the size distribution and, as it is possible to observe above, \n\nthe sizes range from 0.98 to 55.8 ?m. This can be justified with the experimental protocol used \n\nin this reaction: to lower the pH of the suspension, the PCC particles are first in contact with \n\nCIT (low pH) which promotes its deconstruction, and thus forming small particles sizes. As the \n\npH stabilizes and the NaOH is added, this effect stops. The presence of the NaOH solution \n\nprobably contributes to the elongation of these particles. Also the use of dispersant may not be \n\nsufficient to prevent the formation of aggregates with high dimensions, giving the size \n\ndistribution a trimodal behaviour. \n\nS10 is formed by the addition of CIT in stoichiometric ratio to the PCC (1.4). The same \n\nphenomena happen with regard to the deconstruction of the PCC, which justify the high peak \n\nthe in fines zone.  \n\n\n\n4.Results and Discussion \n\n49 \n\n \n\nThe sample S12 is formed with GCC as starting material with the same protocol used in \n\nS2, and when these two samples are compared, it can be pointed out that there size is similar. \n\nAlthough, the peak of fines is higher for S12. The dp50 of the original GCC is about 2.1 \u00b5m \n\n(Sequeira, 2014),  showing that the modification process increased its particle size. \n\nDuring the measurement of S12, a high amount of the suspension was needed to reach the \n\ndesired obscuration index. The suspension seemed to dissolve in the 700 mL of water used to \n\nperform the analysis. Further studies will be needed to understand the behaviour presented by \n\nthese particles.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4.1.5 Electrophoretic Light Scattering \n\nThe zeta potential is important to analyse the electrostatic bonding between the particles. \n\nTable 13 presents the results obtained for each sample. To do this test, three measurements were \n\nperformed with the same suspension and the presented values are an average. \n\n \n\nTable 13. Zeta potential values \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAs it can be noticed, the zeta potential of the modified particles is negative. This can \n\nindicate that the suspensions have basic conditions. Values of zeta potential of calcium citrate \n\ncannot be found in the literature to use as comparative parameter. Though this superficial charge \n\nchanges only happen for PCC. GCC particles have zeta potential of -29 mV (Sequeira, 2014) \n\nand its modified particles (S12) have -40 mV, revealing an increase of the particle stability. S2, \n\nS6 and S10 are located below the stability zone (that is in between \u00b130 and \u00b140, as reported by \n\nChernyaev and Enberg (2015)), which may induce particle aggregation.  \n\nFor filler application, this negative value is not favourable for its bounding with the fibers. \n\nBesides its effect being attenuated with the use of cationic starch, an appropriated retention \n\nagent should be used to prevent the loss of filler content in the paper. Louren\u00e7o et al. (2013) \n\nindicates CPAM as the indicated retention agent to be used in the application of these particles \n\nas paper fillers. \n\nSample Zeta Potential (mV) \n\nPCC + 8.57 \u00b1 1.31 \n\nS2 - 22.8 \u00b1 3.62 \n\nS6 - 18.7 \u00b1 3.26 \n\nS10 - 16.2 \u00b1 3.37 \n\nS12 - 40.5 \u00b1 6.69 \n\n\n\nNew precipitated calcium carbonate derived for application in papermaking \n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\n4.2 Coating and Printing Quality \n \n\nAfter the characterization process, the next step is to test the modified particles as paper \n\ncoating pigment. The coating process is described in section 3.2. \n\nBefore going through the coating process itself, to better understand which amount of PCC \n\n(and posteriorly, of modified particles) is the most suitable to use in this step, coating tests with \n\ndifferent ratios starch/PCC were made. The base paper was coated with three different \n\nstarch/PCC ratios: 1/1, 2/1 and 3/1. The pick-up (difference between the basis weight of the \n\nuncoated and coated paper) of the samples was measured, as well as its air permeability and \n\nroughness. These results can be found in Appendix F II. The air permeability and the roughness \n\nare similar between the three samples. The pick-up increased with the starch/PCC ratio. The \n\nratio 2/1 was found to be the most appropriated to proceed with the coating process, obtaining \n\na pick-up of 5.5. \n\n \n\n4.2.1 Coating Properties \n\nAfter the preliminary tests, sheets of base paper were coated with the modified particles. \n\nThe solid content of the suspensions used in each sample is about 24 to 26 wt% (a detailed \n\ndescription is presented in Appendix F. II.). For each essay, there were made duplicates and, \n\nfor the modified particles there were also made replicas. \n\nBefore evaluating the printing quality of the coated papers, their pick-up, air permeability \n\nand roughness were measured and the results are organized in Table 14. For better \n\nunderstanding, the nomenclature of these samples will be: paper (P) followed by the sample\u2019s \n\nname, eg. P-S2. The base paper (BP), paper coated only with a starch suspension (P-Starch) \n\nand paper coated with a suspension of PCC particles (P-PCC) where used as references. \n\nThe results of pick-up vs Gurley and pick-up vs roughness are plotted in Figure 16. As it \n\ncan be seen, the points are too dispersed and there is no linear tendency between the obtained \n\npick-up and the air permeability, as well as the roughness. Although, for P-S2 and P-S6 it is \n\nclear that the air permeability increases with the pick-up. In this point, it can be highlighted that \n\nfor P-S2 with high pick-up, the Gurley test was performed with 50cc due to the long time that \n\nwas taken to be measured with 100cc. This means that a high pick-up decreases the paper \n\nporosity, thus hampering the passage of air. Also, the roughness values for S-P10 and S-P12 \n\nshow a slightly tendency to increase with the pick-up. \n\n\n\n4.Results and Discussion \n\n51 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.2  Printing Quality \n\nTo evaluate the printing quality, a test mask was printed in each coated paper, and then \n\nseveral parameters were evaluated, such as gamut area and volume, optical density (of cyan, \n\nmagenta, yellow, and black), print-through, colour-to-colour bleeding among others. \n\nGamut area and volume values are presented in Table 14. It is possible to see that some of \n\nthe obtained values are near or higher to those from the base paper. In P-S2 and P-S6 there were \n\nobtained values for gamut area higher than 7000. For the same samples the values of gamut \n\nvolume are also higher. This shows improvements in printing quality when compared with the \n\nuncoated paper. However, the replicas for these samples present lower gamut area. This can be \n\nexplained not only by the difference between the pick-up values, but also by the environmental \n\nchanges that may have happened when the replicas where made. Thus, to avoid modifications \n\nin the rheology of the coating suspension, but also fluctuations during the drying stage, the \n\ncoating process should be performed under controlled environment. \n\nThe gamut area of P-S10 and P-S12 is lower than the one of the base paper. Besides this \n\nfact, P-S10 shows better results than P-Starch and P-PCC, which means that these coating \n\nparticles may also lead to improvement of the printing quality. \n\nAs referred, one of the aspects that can influence the printing quality is the pick-up. As \n\nplotted in Figure 17 the gamut area of the coated papers P-S2, P-S6, and P-S10 increases with \n\nthe pick-up. For P-S12 there is no possible conclusion, since the gamut area values are not \n\ninfluenced by the pick-up.  \n\nFigure 16.

The remaining samples have lower optical density of the black colour. However, when \n\ncompared with the base paper, P-S10 shows a slightly improvement. \n\nThe optical density of the black and yellow shows also higher values for P-S2 and P-S6, \n\nwhen compared with the base paper. The cyan density is slightly lower than the base paper. \n\nHowever, these two samples show greater results for this property. Relatively to the samples P-\n\nS10 and P-S12 the optical density of the colours does not show improvements when compared \n\nwith the base paper. \n\nThe properties of print-through, show-through, black and white (B&amp;W) feathering, and \n\ncolour-to-colour bleed are compiled in the Table 15. \n\nIn the analysis of print and show-though properties it is clear that the presented values are \n\nlowered then the ones obtained for PB showing improvements of these parameters when the \n\npaper is coated with the modified particles. Compared with the PB, only P-PCC shows higher \n\nvalues of print and show-through, meaning that the ink is more likely to penetrate in the paper \n\nwhen coated with PCC particles than with the modified particles. \n\n \n\nFigure 17.

P-S6, P-S10, and P-S12 show that \n\nthe feathering effect of the line decreases with the increasing of the pick-up.

However, the pick-up does not seem \n\nto influence this property. The ink absorption depends on the pigments coating characteristics, \n\nwhich can increase the drying time. The low capacity of absorption increases the probability of \n\nthe bleeding phenomena to occur. Thus, from the obtained results, it can be pointed out that the \n\nmodified coating pigments, in their majority, improve this characteristic when a comparison \n\nwith BP and P-PCC is made. \n\nAnother aspect to take into account when the printing quality is being evaluated is the \n\ncircularity of the black and magenta dots that were printed in the mask. The obtained results are \n\npresent Table 16. Once again, there is no correlation of the point circularity and the pick-up of \n\nthe sheets. For this reason, the average values of circularity and colour-to-colour bleed are \n\ncompared in Table 17. It is noticed that the values improve in the coated papers and those with \n\nlower colour-to-colour bleed have also lower circularity. The circularity of magenta dots is \n\nimproved for P-S2, P-S6 and P-S10, though P-Starch and P-PCC show better definition of these \n\ndots. \n\nTo sum up the overall obtained results, the printing quality of the coated paper is improved \n\nby the modified particles. High values of gamut area and volume were obtained for P-S2 and \n\nP-S6. Also, these samples revealed high optical density of CMYK colours. These results are \n\ncorrelated with the pick-up obtained, meaning that this parameter must be adjusted for the \n\nimprovement of printing quality. The print and show-through capacity were also measured and \n\nthe papers coated with the modified particles had these parameters decreased. \n\nIn regard to line quality, B&amp;W feathering decreases with the increasing of the pick-up for \n\nP-S6, P-S10 and P-S12. Also, the colour-bleeding parameter is improved by the coating with \n\nthe modified particles. \n\nThe black and magenta dots have higher definition in P-S2 and P-S12. P-S10 only showed \n\nimprovements for magenta dots. \n\nThere are some aspects that can influence the obtained results, such as the environment \n\nconditions, as referred. Also, the coating equipment was adjusted between essays. This can be \n\nthe cause of the differences found in the replicas of P-S2 and P-S6. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n4.Results and Discussion \n\n57 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 16.

Figure 20 shows the first attempt \n\nof coating paper with the particles S2 and its replica. It is noticed that the particles of the replica \n\nhave different morphology, meaning that something went wrong with the reaction process, \n\ncausing the decrease of the gamut area. Figure 21 shows the base paper coated with particles \n\nS6, revealing the lamellar shape of the particles.  The coated paper matrix for each sample is \n\npresented in Figure 22. It is notorious that the particles cover most of the paper matrix, and P-\n\nS2 had a denser coverage than P-S6, justifying the high pick-up obtained for P-S2. \n\n However more replicas are needed to prove that these particles, made with citrate buffer, \n\ncan really improve the printing quality of the papers. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 20.

The sheets formation was performed in RAIZ as well as its posterior characterization. \n\nThe evaluation of the loading content in each sheet was evaluated in DEQ. \n\n \n\n4.3.1  Handsheets Characterization \n\n \n\nFiller Retention \n\nThe mineral loading of the produced handsheets was determined following the standard \n\nTAPPI 211, and the content and percentage of retention was calculated by the Equations 4.3 \n\nand 4.4, respectively. \n\n \n\n?????? ???????

(??%)\n (4.4) \n\n \n\nThe retention values are presented in Table 18. For better understanding, the nomenclature \n\nof the fillers will be: sheet (S) following the modified particle used as filler, eg. S-S2. The \n\nreference will be named as S-PCC for the sheet with PCC filler and a basis weight of 80g/m2. \n\nAs it is noticed, the sheets with the modified particles have lower percentage of retention. For \n\nthis reason, and to make a better comparison between sheet samples, another sheet reference \n\nwas produced with PCC filler, though with an average basis weight comparable to those \n\nproduced with the modified fillers. This sample will be named S-PCC1. \n\nThe target filler content in the sheets was 30 wt% and as it can be seen, only the PCC \n\nparticles reached approximately that value. \n\nThe retention is related with the entanglement of the filler with the fibers, and usually \n\nCPAM promotes filler retention. The connection between the fibres and PCC is due to their \n\nopposite charges: fibres have negative charge and PCC, has positive charge, as seen previously. \n\nThe attraction between the PCC particles and the fibers is improved with CPAM. \n\n \n\n\n\n4.Results and Discussion \n\n61 \n\n \n\nTable 18.

Actually, this can be seen \n\nin Figure 23, where it is plotted a linear correlation between the zeta potential of the modified \n\nparticles (Table 13) and the filler content values. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAlthough Louren\u00e7o et al. (2013) had reported that the efficiency of CPAM with highly \n\nnegative charged particles, the same was not observed in this study. This means that the amount \n\nof CPAM may not be sufficient to compensate the particle charge in order to create bonds with \n\nthe fibers. Also, CPAM may not be the adequate retention agent to use on these modified \n\nparticles. This aspect requires further studies to evaluate what can be altered in order to increase \n\nthe mineral loading retention, namely flocculation studies by LDS using only the modified \n\nparticles and a polyelectrolyte. \n\nFigure 23. Zeta Potential and Filler content \n\n\n\nNew precipitated calcium carbonate derived for application in papermaking \n\n \n\n62 \n\n \n\nPaper properties  \n\nAfter the evaluation of the filler retention, the paper properties were evaluated. In Table 19 \n\nthe results of each property associated with each kind of filler used, are presented. \n\nAs it was expected, the grammage of the sheets with the modified samples decreases with \n\nthe filler content in the sheets. The bulk and permeability properties follow the same behaviour. \n\nIn comparison with the references, for the sheets with modified filler, the bulk decreases and \n\nthe air resistance increases. This is due to the lower mineral content in the sheets, increasing \n\nfiber bounding and thus closing the paper matrix.  \n\n The roughness of the paper with the modified fillers is also lower than the references, \n\nhowever S-S6 presents a higher value for this property. This is probably due to the large \n\nagglomerates present in the particles sample. Comparing the remaining samples, the roughness \n\ndecreases with the increasing of the filler content, most certainly because the mineral particles \n\nfill some of the surface pours. On the other hand, it is too soon to predict if these modified \n\nparticles contribute to smooth the paper\u2019s surface. \n\nThe optical properties are related with the interaction of the light with the paper \n\nconstituents, such as fiber and mineral loading. The fiber refining is a factor to take into account \n\nwhen these properties are evaluated. However, the refining degree is the same in all the sheets \n\nin study. Thus, the optical properties are strongly dependent on the filler content. It is noticed \n\n(Figure 24 and Table 19) that the sheets with the modified fillers present lower values for \n\nopacity and light scattering when compared with the reference S-PCC1. The brightness values \n\npresent the same tendency, however S-S6 has the same value as S-PCC.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLight scattering (m\n2\n\n/kg) \n\nFigure 24.

This is due to the low filler content of the sheets with the modified filler which increases \n\nthe fiber-to-fiber bounding. The filler content of PCC-1 is higher, decreasing the bounding \n\nbetween fibers, and thus being less resistance to mechanical tests.  \n\nAlthough, S-S2 has not the lowest filler content but has the highest values for mechanical \n\nproperties. This can be related to the lamellar morphology that, once again, increases the filler-\n\nto-fiber bounding. \n\nThe tensile strength and the tear resistance have the same behaviour, when compared \n\nbetween the modified samples. As shown in Figure 27, the tensile and burst strength have a \n\nlinear correlation, as it was expected. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 27. Tensile Strength vs Burst Strength \n\n \n\nTo sum up, all the properties are dependent on the filler content of the sheets. Compared \n\nwith the S-PCC1, the modified particles formed a less permeable sheet, and the roughness was \n\ndecreased. The optical properties are also disturbed with the use of the modified fillers. The \n\nmechanical properties increased due to the low filler content. Although S-S2 have the highest \n\nvalues for these properties, maybe due to the lamellar morphology of the particles. In fact, when \n\ncomparing with S-S12, which has a much lower filler content, the tensile strength is similar to \n\nthe one of S-S2.  Replicas are needed to really make sure which are the paper properties that \n\nwill improve with the use these modified fillers. \n\n \n\nR\u00b2 = 0.9382\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 3.2 3.4\n\nT\ne\nn\n\nsi\nle\n\n S\ntr\n\ne\nn\n\ng\nth\n\n (\nk\n\nN\n/m\n\n)\n\nBurst Strength (%)\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n5.Conclusions \n\n \n\n67 \n\n \n\n5 Conclusions \n \n\nA discover made by Carecho (2016) where a lamellar morphology, interesting from a \n\npapermaking point of view, was obtained from the mixture between scalenohedral PCC with \n\ncitrate buffer, leading to the present dissertation. Thus the aim of this work consisted in the \n\nstudy and optimization of the reaction between PCC and citrate buffer to understand how the \n\nlamellar morphology was obtained, and its posterior application as paper coating pigment to \n\nevaluate printing quality, as well as its application as paper filler.  \n\nA preliminary research, where the influence of the citrate buffer pH and CIT/PCC ratio at \n\n50 \u00baC was studied, indicates that the CIT/PCC ratio is a crucial parameter to the formation of \n\nthe mentioned particles. The CIT/PCC ratio will influence the final suspension pH, revealing \n\nthat this is also an important aspect to take into account to obtain lamellar particles. Thus, these \n\nparticles are favourably formed at a CIT/PCC ratio ca. 4 and a final suspension with a pH 5.5. \n\nFor better control of the CIT/PCC ratio during the experimental essays, it was created a new \n\nprotocol, in which instead of the preparation of the sodium citrate buffer, two distinct solutions \n\nof CIT (1M) and NaOH (1M) were poured into the PCC suspension. The CIT/PCC ratio was \n\ndecreased for 2, to obtain the same pH, which also resulted in lamellar particles although with \n\nhigher aspect ratio. \n\nTo test more economic solutions to obtain the same structure, the stoichiometric CIT/PCC \n\nratio (1.4) was used with the absence of NaOH. The pH obtained in the final suspension was \n\nca. 5, and lamellar morphology was also obtained. Other aspect was the use of GCC as starting \n\nmaterial. The protocol used was the same as the one used in the first experiment, however the \n\nresulted particles presented platy-morphology. \n\nThus, the lamellar morphology can be obtained at an optimum pH of 5.5 and the CIT/PCC \n\nratio can be controlled, depending on the protocol used. Suspensions with low pH also show \n\nthe formation of lamellar particles, though with lower aspect ratio; suspensions with high pH \n\ndid lead to present lamellar particles. \n\nThe thermal analysis (calcination and TGA up to 900 \u00baC) revealed that the particles in study \n\nare composed in its majority with calcium citrate and ca. 30% of CaCO3.Though there are some \n\nunidentified compounds that represent about 10% of the samples composition. These \n\ncompounds can also be related to this radical modification of the scalenohedral PCC.  \n\nLDS analyses revealed that the particle size decreased when compared with the starting \n\nmaterial, except for the particles obtained by the modification of GCC that showed an increase \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n68 \n \n\nof particle size. The particles of modified PCC have a d50 of 3.30 \u2013 3.50 \u00b5m. However, particles \n\nwith higher aspect ratio seemed to form large aggregates. \n\nRelatively to the particle superficial charge, the PCC modified particles presented negative \n\ncharge, outside of the stability zone. For the GCC modified particles this parameter showed to \n\nincrease the suspension stability. \n\nAfter the characterization process, these particles were applied as coating pigments \n\nrevealing promising results in printing quality. The PCC particles modified with citrate buffer \n\nrevealed high values of optical density resulting in high values of gamut area in comparison \n\nwith the base paper used for coating. The pick-up of these papers was about 7-9, which caused \n\nhigh air permeability. Though the same results were not obtained in replicas made posteriorly. \n\nThese differences can be caused by fluctuation of the environmental conditions, which may \n\nalter the coating suspension properties and the drying conditions, changing in this way the \n\ncoating surface. \n\nThe application of the modified particles as paper fillers did not present good results due \n\nto their low retention in the paper matrix. The highly negative zeta values can be related with \n\nthe filler content: the filler content increases with the particles superficial charge. This can \n\nreveal that the use of CPAM as a retention agent is not efficient. The paper properties were \n\nevaluated with a reference paper with PCC filler with a similar grammage to those obtained \n\nwith the use of the modified fillers. These properties are strongly dependent of the filler content \n\nin the sheets, and thus the mechanical properties increased relatively to the reference. However, \n\nit is noticed an improvement of these properties when lamellar particles are used as filler. As \n\nexpected, the optical properties decreased. The air permeability increased due to the lack of \n\nfiller, allowing the fibers to form a closer matrix. Thus, there is no conclusions to be taken from \n\nthese tests. \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n6. Future Work \n\n \n\n69 \n\n \n\n6 Future Work \n \n\nIn a future work, the next step to be done is the replicas of all the reactions where the \n\nlamellar particles were obtained to confirm these results. It is also important to test the influence \n\nof the temperature in these reactions. \n\nA more complete particle characterization should be done, namely related with elemental \n\nanalysis, since as concluded there are some unidentified compounds presented in the analysed \n\nsamples. Analysis related with the structural mineralogy should be done, such as XDR (X-Ray \n\nDiffraction) to understand the special arrangement of the crystalline structure. The refractive \n\nindex and the hydrophobicity of the particles should also be measured.  \n\nAs the application of these particles as paper filler did not lead to results due to their low \n\nretention, it is important to study if the CPAM is the adequate retention agent, or if it is \n\nnecessary to increase its amount to promote higher retention. Also flocculation studies should \n\nbe made to better understand the behaviour of these particles during paper formation.  \n\nRelatively to the application of these particles as coating pigment, the coater should be \n\nfixed to have a correct distance between the paper surface and the rod, resulting in a more \n\naccurate pick-up. Also, replicas of the previous coatings should be made. \n\nThe use of these particles as coating pigments revealed good results related to printing \n\nquality.

Procedure used by Carecho (2016) to modify the PCC particles \u2013 Reference \n\nprocedure, S0. \n\n \n\nThe procedure used in the previous work followed the presented steps: \n\n1) Add 2 g of industrial PCC in a 400mL beaker, and the add 50 mL of ultrapure water; \n\n2) To homogenize the suspension, it undergoes vigorous magnetic stirring. The \n\nsuspension is heated gradually up to 50 \u00baC. \n\n3) Add the citrate buffer solution (prepared as described above) until it reaches the pH \n\n5.5, measured at 50 \u00baC. \n\n4) Place the mixture in an oil bath at 50 \u00baC. With the help of the mechanic stirrer, Heidolph \n\nRZR-1, and a round point glass propeller, it is stirred at 165 rpm for 48h. After, pour \n\nthe mixture into falcon tubes to undergo centrifugation in the Hettich Universal 32 \n\nequipment. The centrifugation must be done for 20 minutes and at 4500 rpm. This \n\nprocess should be repeated three times with two intermediated washes with distillate \n\nwater. \n\n5) The obtained solid residue is after dried in the oven (Scientific series 9000) at 40 \u00baC \n\nuntil it is completely dry. \n\n \n\nII. Citrate buffer 1M and pH 4.5 \n\n \n\nTo prepare 100mL of citrate buffer the following steps must be done: \n\n1) Using a beaker, weight 21g of citric acid; \n\n2) Add 75mL of ultrapure water and stir magnetically until it dissolves completely; \n\n3) Adjust the mixture pH to 4.3 with pellets of NaOH (about 7,5 g needed); \n\n4) Pour the mixture into a volumetric flask (100 mL), fill up with water and stir; \n\n5) Measure again the pH of the solution. If pH 4.5 is not reached yet, add some NaOH \n\nuntil the pH is obtained. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAppendix A \n\nA.2 \n \n\nIII. PCC particles modification (optimized process) \n\n \n\n1) Add 2 g of industrial PCC in a 400mL beaker, and the add 50 mL of ultrapure water; \n\n2) To homogenize the suspension, it undergoes vigorous magnetic stirring. The \n\nsuspension is heated gradually up to 50 \u00baC; \n\n3) Add the citrate buffer solution (prepared as described above) until it reaches the pH \n\n5.5, measured at 50 \u00baC. \n\n4) When reaction conditions are reached, the mixture remains under stirring for 1h, to \n\nmake sure that all the of the compounds react; \n\n5) After this time, the mixture is poured into falcon tubes to proceed the centrifugation \n\nstep in the Hettich Universal 32 equipment. The centrifugation must be done for 20 \n\nminutes and at 4500 rpm. This process should be repeated three times with two \n\nintermediated washes with distillate water. \n\n6) The obtained solid residue is after dried in the oven (Scientific series 9000) at 40 \u00baC \n\nuntil it is completely dry. \n\n \n\nThis procedure was used to produce the particles S2, S3, S8, S11, and S12. In these \n\nreactions, the buffer pH is changed. This change is made when the buffer is prepared, by adding \n\nmore NaOH to increase the buffer\u2019s pH. \n\n \n\nThe particles of S1 were produced with the same protocol, although as it was an attempt to \n\nreproduce the reference protocol, the buffer preparation was not yet fully understood. So, in \n\nthis case, to form the citrate buffer, instead of using pellets of NaOH, it was used a NaOH \n\nsolution of 0.1M. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAppendix A \n\n \n\nA.3 \n\n \n\nIV. Procedure using a CIT 1M \n\n \n\nThis protocol requires the preparation of CIT 1M before starting to follow the steps \n\ndescribed below. \n\n \n\n1) Add 2 g of industrial PCC in a 400mL beaker, and the add 50 mL of ultrapure water; \n\n2) To homogenize the suspension, it undergoes vigorous magnetic stirring. The \n\nsuspension is heated gradually up to 50 \u00baC; \n\n3) Add the CIT solution drop-to-drop until with until the desired ratio/pH is reached. \n\n4) When reaction conditions are reached, the mixture remains under stirring for 1h, to \n\nmake sure that all the of the compounds react; \n\n5) After this time, the mixture is poured into falcon tubes to proceed the centrifugation \n\nstep in the Hettich Universal 32 equipment. The centrifugation must be done for 20 \n\nminutes and at 4500 rpm. This process should be repeated three times with two \n\nintermediated washes with distillate water. \n\n6) The obtained solid residue is after dried in the oven (Scientific series 9000) at 40 \u00baC \n\nuntil it is completely dry. \n\n \n\nThis protocol was used to obtain S4, S9, S10 and S13. The ratios and the pH of the final \n\nsolutions altered between the samples.  S10 and S13 have the same protocol except that GCC \n\nwas used as starting material of S13. \n\n \n\n \n\nV. Procedure using a CIT 1M solution and a NaOH 1M solution \n\n \n\nThis protocol requires the preparation of CIT 1M and NaOH 1M before starting to follow \n\nthe steps described below. \n\n \n\n1) Add 2 g of industrial PCC in a 400mL beaker, and the add 50 mL of ultrapure water; \n\n2) To homogenize the suspension, it undergoes vigorous magnetic stirring. The suspension \n\nis heated gradually up to 50 \u00baC; \n\n3) As the pH of calcium carbonate is close to 9.5, start carefully with the addition of CIT \n\nsolution drop-to-drop and near the desired pH of 5.5, start controlling it with the NaOH \n\nsolution until the CIT/PCC ratio is reached.  \n\n\n\nAppendix A \n\nA.4 \n \n\n4) When reaction conditions are reached, the mixture remains under stirring for 1h, to make \n\nsure that all the of the compounds react; \n\n5) After this time, the mixture is poured into falcon tubes to proceed the centrifugation step \n\nin the Hettich Universal 32 equipment. The centrifugation must be done for 20 minutes \n\nand at 4500 rpm. This process should be repeated three times with two intermediated \n\nwashes with distillate water. \n\n6) The obtained solid residue is after dried in the oven (Scientific series 9000) at 40 \u00baC \n\nuntil it is completely dry. \n\n \n\nThese method is used in S5, S6, S7 reaction. The principle of all of these reactions is the \n\nsame. However, the CIT/PCC ratio can be altered, as well as the pH of the final suspension. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAppendix B \n\n \n\nB.1 \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix B  \n\n \n\nCoating and Printing Quality \n\n \n\nI. Native Starch suspension \n\n \n\n1) Weight a 100mL beaker with the magnetic bar and tare; \n\n2) In the tared beaker, weight 10g of cationic starch; \n\n3) Pour 37mL of ultrapure water previously heated to 60 \u00baC; \n\n4) Heat the mixture (water + starch) with vigorous stirring up to 65 \u00baC and add more 20 \n\nmL of the preheated water to avoid gel formation and facilitate the stirring; \n\n5) Gradually extend heating to 70 \u00baC and add 3.3 ?m of enzyme (?-amilase) under strong \n\nagitation. Once again extend the heating for 5 minutes until the temperature reach 80 \n\n\u00baC; \n\n6) To end the enzymatic conversion, add 1.7 mL of zinc sulfate solution, keeping the \n\nmixture under stirring. Heat the suspension up to 90-92 \u00baC, keeping the stirring at this \n\ntemperature for 15 minutes (starch\u2019s cooking).
