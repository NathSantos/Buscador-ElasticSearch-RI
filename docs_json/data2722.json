In the SW Atlantic, so far, few studies have \nexanimated the applicability of paleotemperature equations, which may reflect in \nfewer reliable SST estimates. This study aimed to evaluate two marine proxies for \nSST reconstructions: the alkenones unsaturation index (UK\u201937) and the ratio Mg/Ca in \ndifferent planktonic foraminifera species and size fractions (G. ruber pink; G. ruber \nwhite senso stricto and senso lato; between 250 - 300 \u00b5m and 300 - 355 \u00b5m; G. \ntruncatulinoides (d) crusted and non-crusted forms, between 380 \u2013 620 \u00b5m; and G. \ninflata 300 \u2013 425 \u00b5m). The samples were collected in the shelf break of South \nBrazilian Bight (SBB, 22 \u00b0S to 27 \u00b0S). The proxies were converted into SSTs and \nthen compared to modern SSTs from the World Ocean Atlas and satellite images. \nThe first chapter describes the UK\u201937 signals and the applicability of three different \npaleotemperature equations, and the second chapter describes the Mg/Ca a proxy \nfor past SSTs and water mass conditions after applying the most used \npaleotemperature equations for the ratio Mg/Ca. The UK\u201937 seems to record mostly \nautumn conditions at 0m, and the most recent Bayspline equation results into more \nsimilar temperature averages when compared to modern annual SSTs (p-value of \n0.81, n = 47, ?SST of -0.03\u00b0C \u00b1 0.27), while the most used linear equations result into \nSSTs similar to autumn conditions. In subtropical regions with low-temperature \nvariations (~4\u00b0C), the function UK\u201937 versus SSTs works in an exponential relation, \nand they are related to seasonal temperatures. For the Mg/Ca in planktonic \nforaminifera species, the Mg/Ca-inferred temperatures agree well with modern ocean \ntemperatures. Our data suggest that in different size fractions the tested species \nrespond differently to the most used species-specific and general species \npaleotemperature equations. All the upper water column species agree well with \ntemperatures at 0-meter depth. The G. ruber (p) responds well to the SS equation, \nwhere the smallest and the largest size results into annual and autumn estimates, \nrespectively (p-value of 0.81 and 0.71, n = 23); the smallest size of G. ruber (w) s.s. \nprovides summer estimates applying the GE equation (p-value of 0.21, n = 7), while \nthe largest size provides annual estimates (p-value of 0.86, n = 13). The G. ruber (w) \ns.l. has significant averages when compared the largest size with autumn and \nsummer conditions (p-value of 0.21 for both, n = 16); the deep-dwelling species G. \ninflata and the G. truncatulinoides (d) crusted form reflect the uplift of the SACW, \ncalcifying at 10 and 20 m depth (p-value of 0.89, n = 10 and p-value of 0.06, n = 14, \nrespectively), while the G. truncatulinoides (d) non-crusted form records annual \ntemperature in deep water layers conditions (p-value of 0.06, n = 16). This is the first \nstudy to report Mg/Ca ratios in surface-dwelling and deep-dwelling planktonic \nforaminifera tests obtained in core-top samples at the SBB. This validation will inform \nthe reconstruction of past environmental conditions of SW Atlantic, especially in the \nSBB. \n \nKeywords: Marine geochemistry, paleotemperature, foraminifera, alkenones \n\nunsaturation index, Mg/Ca-based, paleoceanography, water masses, \n\npaleotemperature equations, marine proxies.  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nResumo \n \nAs reconstru\u00e7\u00f5es das condi\u00e7\u00f5es da temperatura superficial do mar s\u00e3o importantes \npara avaliar o clima do passado da Terra. No Atl\u00e2ntico SE, no entanto, poucos \nestudos avaliaram a aplicabilidade das equa\u00e7\u00f5es de convers\u00e3o dos indicadores \ngeoqu\u00edmicos para temperatura, o que pode resultar em estimativas de \npaleotemperatura de menor acur\u00e1cia. Este estudo avaliou dois indicadores marinhos \nde paleotemperatura: o \u00edndice de insatura\u00e7\u00e3o de alquenonas (UK\u201937), e a raz\u00e3o \nMg/Ca em testas de foramin\u00edferos planct\u00f4nicos de diferentes esp\u00e9cies e fra\u00e7\u00f5es de \ntamanho (G. ruber pink; G. ruber white senso stricto e senso lato; entre 250 - 300 \n\u00b5m e 300 - 355 \u00b5m; G. truncatulinoides (d) encrustadas e n\u00e3o-encrustadas, entre \n380 \u2013 620 \u00b5m; e G. inflata 300 \u2013 425 \u00b5m). As amostras s\u00e3o provenientes da \nplataforma externa e quebra da plataforma do Embaiamento de S\u00e3o Paulo (22\u00b0S a \n27\u00b0S). Os indicadores foram transformados em TSM e ent\u00e3o comparados com as \ntemperaturas obtidas por meio do World Ocean Atlas e de imagens de sat\u00e9lite. O \nprimeiro cap\u00edtulo apresenta os dados de UK\u201937 e a aplicabilidade de tr\u00eas equa\u00e7\u00f5es \nde paleotemperatura. O segundo cap\u00edtulo apresenta dados da raz\u00e3o Mg/Ca como \nindicador de TSM e condi\u00e7\u00f5es de massa d\u2019\u00e1gua ap\u00f3s a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o das equa\u00e7\u00f5es de \nconvers\u00e3o. O UK\u201937 apresenta influ\u00eancia do outono em 0 m de profundidade em seus \nregistros, e a mais recente equa\u00e7\u00e3o Bayspline resulta em m\u00e9dias de TSM mais \nsimilares com as condi\u00e7\u00f5es atuais, principalmente quando comparado com a m\u00e9dia \nanual de TSM (p-valor de 0.81, n = 47, ?SST de -0.03\u00b0C \u00b1 0.27), j\u00e1 as equa\u00e7\u00f5es \nlineares mais conhecidas resultam em TSM mais parecidas com condi\u00e7\u00f5es de \noutono. No geral, em regi\u00f5es com pouca varia\u00e7\u00e3o de TSM (~1.5 \u00b0C), o UK\u201937 \nresponde em uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o exponencial com a temperatura. A raz\u00e3o Mg/Ca em testas \nde foramin\u00edferos planct\u00f4nicos, quando convertidas em TSM, resultam em m\u00e9dias \nsimilares com as condi\u00e7\u00f5es atuais de temperatura. Os nossos dados sugerem que \nas equa\u00e7\u00f5es espec\u00edficas para cada esp\u00e9cie (SS) e as equa\u00e7\u00f5es gerais (GE) \nresultam em diferentes m\u00e9dias de TSM para cada esp\u00e9cie/fra\u00e7\u00e3o de tamanho. \nTodas as esp\u00e9cies de superf\u00edcie respondem bem com as temperaturas em 0 metros \nde profundidade. A G. ruber (p) responde bem \u00e0 equa\u00e7\u00e3o SS, onde a menor e a \nmaior fra\u00e7\u00e3o de tamanho resulta em m\u00e9dias similares \u00e0s TSM anuais e de outono, \nrespectivamente (p-valor de 0.81 e 0.71, n = 23); a menor fra\u00e7\u00e3o de tamanho da \nesp\u00e9cie G. ruber (w) s.s. resulta em m\u00e9dias similares \u00e0s TSM de ver\u00e3o com a \nequa\u00e7\u00e3o GE (p-valor de 0.21, n = 7), enquanto a maior fra\u00e7\u00e3o de tamanho resulta \nem TSM anual (p-valor de 0.86, n = 13). A maior fra\u00e7\u00e3o de tamanho da esp\u00e9cie G. \nruber (w) s.l. resulta em m\u00e9dias significativas quando comparadas com TSM de \noutono e de ver\u00e3o (p-valor de 0.21 para ambas, n = 16). Os registros geoqu\u00edmicos \ndas esp\u00e9cies de subsuperf\u00edcie, como a G. inflata e a G. truncatulinoides (d) \nencrustada registram a subida da ACAS para a superf\u00edcie na \u00e1rea de estudo, \ncalcificando em 10 e 20 metros de profundidade, respectivamente (p-valor de 0.89, \nn = 10 e de 0.06, n = 14, respectivamente), enquanto a G. truncatulinoides (d) n\u00e3o-\nencrustada aparenta registrar as condi\u00e7\u00f5es anuais de temperatura em \nprofundidades mais pr\u00f3ximas da ACAS, com m\u00e9dias um pouco mais elevadas que \nas duas esp\u00e9cies de subsuperf\u00edcie (p-valor de 0.06, n = 16). Este \u00e9 o primeiro estudo \nque relata as raz\u00f5es Mg/Ca em diferentes esp\u00e9cies de foramin\u00edferos planct\u00f4nicos \nno SBB.

Each of these proxies varies as the sea temperature \n\nchanges and, after the sediment deposition, they are usually found well preserved \n\nwithin the sediment fractions.  \n\n To convert the geochemical proxy data to quantitative temperature \n\nestimative, both for foraminifera tests and UK\u201937, a conversion equation is applied. \n\nThese equations have different coefficients, which may change according to \n\ndifferent locations (PRAHL et al., 1988; MUELLER et al., 1998; CONTE et al., \n\n2006; TIERNEY AND TINGLEY, 2018), species and/or size fractions (ANAND et \n\nal., 2003; CONTE et al., 2006; RICHEY et al., 2012; RIVEIROS et al., 2016; \n\nTHIRUMALAI et al., 2016). \n\nWithin the paleotemperature context, the number of paleoceanographic \n\nstudies in the SW Atlantic has increased during the past decades (e.g. LEDUC \n\net al., 2010; PIVEL et al., 2013; CHIESSI et al., 2014; SANTOS et al., 2014; \n\nCORDEIRO et al., 2014; LESSA et al., 2016; SANTOS et al., 2017; LOUREN\u00c7O \n\net al., 2017; DAUNER et al., 2019), and, so far, one study has tested the \n\napplicability of UK\u201937-based paleotemperature equations (COCCEPIORI et al., \n\n2018). Despite the growth in interest of paleotemperature in the region, the SW \n\nAtlantic still lacks validation studies for the SST proxies that are commonly used \n\nfor this purpose. \n\nThe aim of this thesis was to validate the different paleotemperature \n\ncalibrations for these proxies in the SW Atlantic Ocean. This is enable more SST \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n13 \n\naccurate estimates and, consequently, more robust paleoceanographic \n\nreconstructions. To do so, this master\u2019s thesis was divided into two chapters to \n\nassess two different marine paleotemperature proxies. In the first chapter the \n\nalkenones unsaturation index proxy is presented and discussed, and in the \n\nsecond chapter, the Mg/Ca ratio of different species of planktonic foraminifera \n\ntests was analyzed. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n14 \n\nCHAPTER 1 \n \n\nTesting global calibrations for reconstruction of sea surface temperatures \n\nusing UK\u201937 as a proxy: Which is the best model for the SW Atlantic Ocean?  \n\n \n\n1.1. Introduction \n \n\n The alkenones are a group of long chain (C37-C39) di-, tri- and tetra-\n\nunsaturated methyl and ethyl ketones. They are synthesized by coccolithophores \n\nof the class Prymnesiophyceae, mainly the Haptophyte algae Emiliania huxleyi \n\nand Gephyrocapsa oceanica (VOLKMAN et al., 1980; DE LEEUW et al., 1980). \n\nThese species inhabit the upper mixed layer in open waters (about 20 \u2013 30-meter \n\ndepth; WINTER et al., 1994), and in the South Atlantic, they are associated to \n\nwaters with a high content of nutrients and low temperatures (BOECKEL et al., \n\n2006). \n\n The unsaturation level of the alkenones (UK\u201937) shows a temperature \n\nresponse, such that the lower the sea water temperature, the higher the \n\nunsaturation level of this index (BRASSELL et al., 1986a; PRAHL AND \n\nWAKEHAM, 1987; PRAHL et al., 1988; SIKES et al., 1997). The index itself was \n\nfirst calculated after Brassell et al. (1986b) and readjusted by Prahl and Wakeham \n\n(1987) (Equation 1), where: \n\n \n\n \n\nU37\nK? =  \n\n[C37:2]\n\n[C37:2+C37:3]\n      (Equation 1) \n\n \n\n Prahl and Wakeham (1987) observed the linear correlation between UK\u201937 \n\nand temperature in laboratory culture using the E. huxleyi. From there, Prahl et \n\nal. (1988) used samples from sediment traps collected along the Pacific Ocean \n\nand developed the most widely used global calibration of UK\u201937 as a \n\npaleotemperature proxy, which is defined as UK\u201937 = 0.034T + 0.043 (Equation 1). \n\nThis equation has been globally applied for palaeoceanographic studies \n\nregarding reconstruction of SST based on UK\u201937 (SIKES et al., 1991; ROSELL-\n\nMEL\u00c9 et al., 1995; MUELLER et al., 1998; amongst others).  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n15 \n\nConte et al. (2006) gathered core-top samples throughout different ocean \n\nbasins, as well as previous published UK\u201937 data around the globe, to develop a \n\nglobal alkenones equation. In contrast to the linear relationship of Prahl et al. \n\n(1988), they found that on a global scale, the UK\u201937 shows a polynomial correlation \n\nwith the SST (T = -0.957 + 54.293(UK\u201937) \u2013 52.894(UK\u201937)2 + 28.231(UK\u201937)3 \u2013 \n\nEquation 2). Then, they proposed a third level polynomial equation to reconstruct \n\npast SST. \n\nOther equations for the UK\u201937 have also been performed in different \n\nregions/basins to observed possible variations among them (e.g., SIKES et al., \n\n1991; ROSELL-MEL\u00c9 et al., 1995; PELEJERO AND CALVO, 2003; MULLER et \n\nal., 1998). These authors found, mostly, a linear correlation between their UK\u201937 \n\nvalues and the SST. \n\nFor the South Atlantic Ocean, Muller et al. (1998) developed an equation \n\nfor the SE portion of this basin using core-top samples. These authors found a \n\nsimilar linear equation to the Prahl et al. (1988) equation (UK\u201937 = 0.033T + 0.069 \n\n\u2013 Equation 3), suggesting that both equations can be properly applied in their \n\nstudy basins, as well as in other regions. \n\nCeccopieri et al. (2018) were the first authors to test different alkenone \n\nequations (i.e., PRAHL et al., 1988; MULLER et al. 1998 and TIERNEY AND \n\nTINGLEY, 2018) in the SW Atlantic aiming to observe which calibration results in \n\nmost reliable SSTs reconstructions for the region. They found that in the Campos \n\nBasin (20.5 ?S to 24 ?S), the UK\u201937 correlates best to modern mean annual SSTs \n\nwhen the Mueller et al. (1998) equation is applied. They also observed a strong \n\ncorrelation of UK\u00b437 SST estimates with winter SSTs which, according to these \n\nauthors, might be a consequence of the upwelling of the South Atlantic Central \n\nWater (SAWC), which carries cold water and high nutrients content to the surface. \n\nThis phenome is very significant and frequent in the area, especially in the Cabo \n\nFrio (22 \u00b0S) region. \n\nThe South Brazilian Bight (SBB - 23?S - 28?S), is a region that lacks \n\npaleotemperature studies even though it plays an important role in the global \n\nocean circulation system (PETERSON AND STRAMMA, 1991), transporting \n\nsalty and warm waters southwards. Yet, in the SBB, the UK\u201937-SST reconstructions \n\nhave assumed that Prahl et al. (1988) is the one that provides most reliable \n\nestimates (i.e. BENTHIEN AND M\u00dcLLER, 2000; LOUREN\u00c7O et al., 2018). The \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n16 \n\nreliability of the inferred results from this equation, however, has not been tested \n\nso far. \n\nAs previously mentioned, in the SW Atlantic, there is only one study \n\nregarding the applicability of the equations for SST reconstructions based on UK\u201937 \n\n(i.e. CECCOPIERI et al., 2018), and it covers an area north of the SBB, which \n\nshows different oceanographic conditions. Considering that the SW Atlantic has \n\nnot been much explored in the paleoceanographic field, analyzing what is the \n\ninfluence of the temperature on the marine sediments of this basins improve the \n\nunderstanding of past ocean conditions in the area.  \n\nTherefore, this study tested the applicability of four SST-UK\u201937 based \n\nequations in the SBB in order to identify which one provides SSTs that are more \n\nsimilar to observed SSTs. In this first chapter, the main goal will be to perform a \n\nregional calibration of the UK\u201937 index to compare with previously published \n\ncalibrations. This validation is important to the understanding paleotemperature \n\nestimates in the SW Atlantic in the context of data gathered from other regions. \n\n \n\n1.2. Objectives  \n \n\nThe main goal of this chapter was to validate what SST-UK\u201937 based \n\ncalibrations are more suitable for the SBB. The validation will help to improve \n\nfuture paleotemperature data that will be analyzed in the study area and, \n\ntherefore, to understand the palaeoceanographic and paleoclimate evolution of \n\nthe SW Atlantic. \n\nTo reach the main goal of this chapter the following targets were \n\nestablished: \n\ni. Generate data from the geochemical proxies in marine sediments \n\n(UK\u201937), from samples collected along the South Brazilian Bight; \n\nii. Compare the UK\u201937 data to observed modern SST and verify what is \n\nor is there is a correlation between them; \n\niii. Compare the SST generated by the UK\u201937 in this study to previously \n\npublished data from the literature; \n\niv. Verify/Validate if the available paleotemperature coefficients are \n\nadequate for the study area. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n17 \n\n1.3. Study Area \n \n\n The SBB is located on the SE Atlantic Ocean, extending from Cabo Frio \n\nto Cabo de Santa Marta (23?S - 28?S, Figure 1). The area presents an arc-shape \n\norientation, and its continental shelf is very wide, ranging from 71 to 231 km wide \n\n(ZEMBRUSKI, 1979). The SBB does not receive large a fluvial discharge due to \n\nthe uplift of the Serra do Mar mountain formation, that deviates the largest rivers \n\ntowards the continent, (MAHIQUES et al., 2002; 2004). Therefore, the \n\nsedimentary processes in the area are dominated by the local ocean circulation \n\n(MAHIQUES et al., 2004).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1 - Map of the study area and sample locations, as the triangles represent the locations \nwhere the samples were retrieved. The yellow, green and the orange triangles represent the \nContornitos (CTN - FAPESP n\u00b0 2016/03381-3), Pockmarks (PM - FAPESP n\u00b0 2016/22194-0), \nand GEOSEDEx (GEO) projects respectively. The squares represent the data that were available \non the literature and were used in this study. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n18 \n\n The Sao Sebasti\u00e3o Island is marked as a division point of the sea floor \n\ncomposition, where southwards of the island, the sea floor is composed of mud, \n\nand northwards, calcium carbonate (MAHIQUES et al., 2004). In the outer \n\ncontinental shelf, the presence of coarse sediments is higher, and their presence \n\nis related to the sediment depositions during the events of regression of the sea \n\nlevel (MAHIQUES et al., 2011). \n\n The SBB is dominated by the Brazil Current (BC), which flows southwards \n\nover the shelf break and continental slope (CAMPOS et al., 1995; 2000; \n\nSTRAMMA AND ENGLAND, 1999, Figure 2). The BC transports two water \n\nmasses: the Tropical Water (TW; Temperature > 20?C; Salinity > 36), which is a \n\nsuperficial water mass and it is known for presenting warm, salty and oligotrophic \n\nwaters; and the SACW (Temperature > 6?C &lt;20?C, Salinity > 34.6 and &lt;36), \n\nwith colder, less saline and nutrient-enriched waters, which flows at the \n\npycnocline levels (MIRANDA, 1985; SILVEIRA et al., 2000). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 On Figure 2A represents the vertical structure of the BC over the SBB (Adapted from \nMaatsura, 1986). The meanders caused by the BC can be observed through satellite images on \nFigures 2B, 2C and 2D (Adapted from Calado et al., 2008). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n19 \n\n The BC forms meanders and eddies on, especially north of the SBB, due \n\nto the abrupt changes in the coastline orientation (CAMPOS et al., 2000, Figure \n\n2). The presence of the clockwise meanders leads to the rise of cold waters (e.g., \n\nSACW) into the upper water column, generating an upwelling structure \n\n(CAMPOS et al., 1996; 2000; LIMA, 1997; SILVEIRA et al., 2008), making the \n\nmixed layer and the nutricline shallower (JIN et al., 2016; MCGILLICUDDY, \n\n2016). This upwelling structure can be very significant in some parts of the shelf \n\nbreak in the austral summer, as reported by Brandini et al. (1990), where they \n\nobserved that in some parts of the shelf break the primary productivity was higher \n\nthan in coastal zones. The seasonal enhanced of the upwelling is caused mainly \n\nby the increase of the strength of the northeasterly (NE) winds (MATSUURA, \n\n1986, CASTEL\u00c3O et al., 2004), which, besides bringing the SAWC to the surface, \n\nalso favors the Coastal Water (CW) to move offshore. \n\n The uplift of cold waters changes the spatial variation of SST, salinity, \n\nnutrients and suspended material, causing changes on the light availability in the \n\nphotic zones (BRANDINI et al., 1990a; BRANDINI, 2014), resulting in the \n\nvariation in chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration, biomass and phytoplankton \n\ndynamics throughout the SBB (ODEBRECHT AND CASTELLO, 2001; GAETA \n\nAND BRANDINI, 2006; BRAGA et al., 2008; BRANDINI et al., 2014). \n\n \n\n1.4. Material and Methods  \n\n1.4.1. Alkenones analyses and Nannoplankton Identification \n\n \n\nThe material analyzed in this thesis comes from 25 core-tops (5 core-tops \n\nin 0 \u2013 0.5 cm, and 20 core-tops in 0 - 1 cm, Figure 1, Table 1, Appendix) retrieved \n\nwith multiple-corers (MUC) and box-corers, from the inner and outer shelf, as well \n\nas upper slope off the SE Brazilian margin (24\u00b0S to 27\u00b0S) during three \n\noceanographic cruises, conducted on board the R/V Alpha Crucis, from the \n\nOceanographic Institute of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, as part of three other \n\nprojects. \n\n Previously published core-top UK\u201937 data from the study area (BENTHIEN \n\nAND M\u00dcLLER, 2000; LOUREN\u00c7O et al., 2017, Table 1, Appendix) were also \n\nadded into the data set to improve the statistical analysis and precision of the \n\nresults. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n20 \n\n The samples were extracted and purified at the Laboratory of Marine \n\nOrganic Chemistry (LABQOM) at the Oceanographic Institute of the University of \n\nS\u00e3o Paulo (IOUSP), as part of other researches. \n\n The analytical procedure to alkenones determination was adapted from \n\nLouren\u00e7o (2007). About 10 g of freeze-dried sediments of each sample were \n\nused. After the samples being macerated and weighed, 80 mL of a mixture of \n\ndichloromethane (DCM) and n-hexane were added into the samples for them to \n\nbe submitted to the Soxhlet for 8 h. In all samples, it was added 50 ?L of a solution \n\nof standard 1-hexadecane and 1-eicosene (50 ng ?L-1) to them be used as a \n\nsurrogate. At the end of the extraction process, the samples had their volume \n\nreduced (concentrated) to, approximately, 0.5 mL in a rotary evaporator in 45 ?C.  \n\n The purification of the total organic extract (fraction) was performed by \n\nadsorption column, where the sample was submitted onto 1 g of alumina and 2 g \n\nof silica, both deactivated at 5% with water and extracted 5 times with n-hexane \n\nand sodium sulfate. The concentrated organic fraction was eluted in the column \n\nwith 6 mL of n-hexane, as well as 10 mL of DCM/n-hexane. These solutions \n\nprovide aliphatic hydrocarbons and alkenones. The eluate had its volume \n\nreduced to, approximately, 0.5 mL in the rotary vapor and then transferred to \n\namber glass ampoules, where 50 ?L of a solution containing 50 g ?L-1 of the \n\ninternal chromatographic standard (1-tetradecene) was added. After extraction of \n\na batch of samples, it was performed an analytical blank (sodium sulfate). \n\n The alkenones were identified and quantified through the injection of 1 ?L \n\nof the final extraction through a gas chromatograph with automatic injector \n\ncoupled to a flame ionization detector (GC-FID; Agilent GC System 6890 Series). \n\nA chromatographic column of 50 m of length x 0.32 mm of intern diameter x 0.17 \n\n?m of film thickness, where the stationary phase was composed by 5% difenil \n\nand 95% dimetilpolisioloxane. The carrier gas was H2 (purity > 99.999%), with a \n\nconstant pressure of 7.24 psi. The injector temperature was constantly \n\nmaintained at 280 \u00b0C and the injections were conducted in the splitless mode, \n\nwith the detector kept at 325 \u00b0C. \n\n The quantification of the compounds was performed through the software \n\nHP Chemstation (G2070 BA). The criteria applied to accept the analytical curve \n\nof the compound was the Pearson linear correlation equal or superior to 99.5% \n\n(R2 = 0.995). The identification was made of the ratio of mass and area of the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n21 \n\nsurrogate standards with the internal chromatographic standard. For the \n\nalkenones, the C37:3, C37:2, C38:3Et, C38:3Me, C38:2Et, C38:2Me compounds were \n\nidentified and quantified. It was calculated the total concentration of the \n\nalkenones (i.e. C37:3 + C37:2), and the UK\u201937 were calculated after Prahl et al. \n\n(1988), as described in Equation 1. A correlation analyses was then used to verify \n\nif the total alkenones concentration responded to the chl-a concentrations (see \n\nthe next topic). \n\n The nannofossil identification was performed by the South Atlantic \n\nPaleoceanography Laboratory (LaPAS) team, also at IOUSP. At LaPAS, the \n\nidentification and counting of the coccolithophores (i.e., E. huxleyi and G. \n\noceanica) from the samples of this thesis was performed under a light polarizing \n\nmicroscope (1000 x). To do this, slides were prepared, according to the Koch and \n\nYoung (2007) method. The cells were counted according to the visual sight \n\nmethod (QUADROS, 2007), where at least 300 specimens on each slide were \n\ncounted and identified. The taxonomic classification to identify the \n\nnanoplanktonic species was performed after Young et al. (2003) and Antunes \n\n(2007), using as support material the Nannotax3 website (YOUNG et al., 2014). \n\n Even though all samples were retrieved above the lysocline, located at \n\n4300 m depth in the South Atlantic (DITTERT et al., 1999), the E. huxleyi-\n\nC.leptoporus dissolution index, in here including the Boeckel and Baumann \n\n(2004) modification (CEX\u2019; Equation 4), was applied to observe if the samples \n\nwere submitted to high dissolution. In this study, the large Gephyrocapsa sp. (&lt;\n\n3 \u00b5m) was considered instead of G. ericsonii, as Saavedra-Pellitero et al. (2010) \n\nhave executed. \n\n \n\nCEX? =  \n?.??????? + ???????????? sp.\n\n?.??????? + ???????????? sp.+ ?.??????????\n  (Equation 4) \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n22 \n\n1.4.2. Acquisition Sea Surface Temperatures, Chlorophyll-a, and Statistical \n\nAnalysis \n\n \n\n \n\n The annual (SSTAN) and austral seasonal (summer \u2013 SSTSU, autumn \u2013 \n\nSSTAU, winter \u2013 SSTWI, and spring \u2013 SSTSP) SSTs, and the chl-a concentrations \n\nwere obtained from the Aqua (EOS PM) satellite with the Moderate Resolution \n\nImaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. All the images were acquired in the \n\nNASA\u2019s website \u201cOcean Color\u201d at https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi/l3. \n\n For this thesis, third level daytime images were used, with a 4 km \n\nresolution. The images were treated using the SeaDAS software (version 7.5.1, \n\navailable on https://seadas.gsfc.nasa.gov/). It was possible to SSTs ranging from \n\n2002 to 2017. The SSTs and chl-a concentrations from the satellites represent \n\nthe austral seasonal and annual sea surface conditions. Data from the \n\ntemperature of the water column was obtained with the World Ocean Atlas 2013 \n\n(WOA13) (LOCARNINI et al., 2013) up to 25 m, because deeper than that, the \n\ndata became not available. \n\n After obtaining the satellite and water column sea temperatures for each \n\nsample location, it was tested the normality of the data with the Shapiro-Wilk test, \n\nand it was observed if the dataset had outliers. Afterward, a correlation analysis \n\n(Pearson\u2019s correlation) was performed between the UK\u201937 and the sea \n\ntemperature with the Past software (version 3.18), to observe the correlation \n\nbetween them in order to observe what season/water depth may be being \n\nrecorded in the UK\u201937 signals. \n\nThe UK\u201937 signals were then converted into SST after four \n\npaleotemperature equations (PRAHL et al., 1988; MULLER et al., 1998; CONTE \n\net al., 2006; TIERNEY AND TINGLEY, 2018). These equations were selected \n\nbecause: i) Prahl et al. (1988) is the widely used paleo-proxy paleotemperature \n\nequation for UK\u201937; ii) Muller et al. (1998) performed their analyses in the SE \n\nAtlantic Ocean; iii) Conte et al.

The ?SST shows what equation shows lower discrepancies \n\nbetween the calculated SST against the satellite SST. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.5. Results \n \n\nThe extracted values of the UK\u201937 from all samples, as well as the seasonal \n\nand annual SST gathered from the Aqua MODIS Mission, are shown in Table 2 \n\n(Appendix) and in Figure 3. \n\nThe UK\u201937 showed an average of 0.863 (\u00b1 0.02, N = 45), where the highest \n\nindex showed the value of 0.962, and the lowest 0.804. The UK\u201937 data in this \n\nstudy do not present outliers and present normal distribution (Table 2, Appendix). \n\nThe total concentration of the alkenones had values between 0.03 ng/g to 0.92 \n\nng/g (average of 0.23 ng/g; \u00b1 0.19, N = 42; Table 3, Appendix). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n24 \n\n \n\nFigure 3 - Values of the UK\u201937 and the total concentration of the alkenones (ng/g) along the SBB. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe summary of the results from the satellite SSTs is listed in Table 4 \n\n(Appendix) and Figure 4. In general, SSTSU showed the warmest temperatures, \n\nand SSTWI showed the coolest temperatures. The SSTAN and SSTAU showed \n\ntemperatures within the 24 \u00b0C, and the SSTSP averages in the 23 \u00b0C.

The temperatures \n\ngathered from the WOA13, on the other hand, presented outliers and did not \n\npresent a normal distribution. Therefore, a non-parametric analysis of non-\n\ntransformed data for the statistical analysis was performed in this study. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n26 \n\nFor the satellite image temperatures, all seasonal SSTs, except for SSTSU, \n\npresented a strong correlation with the UK\u201937 (R > 0.5, N = 45) (Table 6, Appendix). \n\nThe UK\u201937 presented highest correlation with the SSTAU (R = 0.61, p &lt;0.05, N = \n\n45). For the sea temperatures obtained with the WOA13, in general, the depth of \n\n10 m showed the highest correlations with the UK\u201937, (Table 7, Appendix) where \n\nthe highest was observed with the autumn temperatures at 10 m deep (R = 0.43, \n\np-value &lt;0.05, N = 42). \n\nThe inferred SSTs-UK\u201937 based in published equations are listed in Table \n\n8. Overall, all equations result in temperatures that are similar to modern SSTs. \n\nThe average of Prahl et al. (1988) equation is 24.85 \u00b0C (\u00b1 0.86, N = 45). The \n\nMueller et al. (1998) equation shows an average of 24.91 \u00b0C (\u00b1 0.94, N = 45). \n\nThe polynomial equation developed by Conte et al. (2006) results in an average \n\nof 26.64 \u00b0C (\u00b1 0.74, N = 45), and the Bayesian equation created by Tierney and \n\nTingley (2018) shows an average of 24.40 \u00b0C (\u00b1 1.08, N = 45). \n\nThe results of the ?SST calculated after the Prahl et al. (1988), Muller et al. \n\n(1998), Conte et al. (2006) and Tierney and Tingley (2018) are shown in Tables \n\nTable 9, Table 10, Table 11, Table 12, respectively (Appendix). In general, the \n\nlowest ?SST within the published equations and the satellite SSTs was between \n\nSSTAN and the Tierney and Tingley (2018) equation (-0.03 \u00b0C \u00b1 0.27). In Figure \n\n5, it is possible to observe how the data from this study (purple line) fits in a \n\nscatterplot when compared to the previously published global calibrations. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n27 \n\n \n\nFigure 5 - Scatterplot integrating all UK\u201937 data from previous equations used in this study against \nSSTAU, where Prahl et al.

The gray area highlights \nthe range of temperature from the gathered in the samples of this study (purple line). \n\n \n\n \n\nOn Table 13 (Appendix) it is possible to observe the results of the p-values \n\nof the Kruskal-Wallis test, where it the averages of the UK\u201937-inferred SSTs \n\nobtained with the published equations are compared to the annual and seasonal \n\nSSTs gathered from the satellite images. Our data suggest that there is no \n\nsignificant difference between the Prahl et al. (1988) and Mueller et al. (1998) \n\nSSTs estimates with the SSTAU (p-value of 0.48 and 0.61, respectively). \n\nThe Tierney and Tingley (2018) equation presented the most similar \n\naverages with modern temperatures within all equations, with strong signifancy \n\nwith the SSTAN (p-value of 0.87). On the other hand, the Conte et al. (2006) is the \n\nequation that gives less representative results, showing its highest (but low) p-\n\nvalue with SSTSU (p-value of 0.007). When compared with the water column \n\ntemperatures gathered with the WOA13 (0 to 25 m), none of the equations result \n\nin significant similar averages. \n\nThe chl-a concentrations had the lowest values in the austral summer \n\n(0.16 mg dm-3 \u00b1 0.09, N = 45), while the highest concentrations were found in the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n28 \n\nwinter (0.27 mg dm-3 \u00b1 0.16, N = 45, Table 14, Appendix). All chl-a concentrations \n\nshowed significant negative correlation with the UK\u201937 values (R &lt;- 0.5). The most \n\nnegative correlation was observed with the winter season (R \u2013 0.55, p &lt;0.001, N \n\n= 45) (Table 15, Appendix). \n\nBetween the two known species considered to synthesize alkenones, the \n\ncoccolithophore G. oceanica was the most abundant species (Table 16, \n\nAppendix), composing about 19.56% of the total sample (\u00b1 5.98, N = 21), while \n\nE. huxleyi species correspond to approximately 17.14% of the total assemblage \n\n(\u00b1 8.66, N = 21). \n\nThe CEX\u2019 (Table 17, Appendix), showed values higher than 0.80, and an \n\naverage of 0.96 \u00b1 0.03, where the lowest index was 0.89 and highest was 1.0, \n\nsuggesting that the samples have not been under dissolution processes. \n\n \n\n1.6. Discussion \n\n1.6.1. UK\u201937 records and its synthesizers in the SBB \n\n \n\n \n\nThe UK\u201937 signals from the samples of this study suggest that, except for \n\nthe SSTSU, all seasons show a strong correlation with the UK\u201937 signals at 0 m, \n\nespecially the SSTAU, which seems to play a major role in these records. \n\nPrevious proxy validation studies in different basins have also reported the \n\nimprint of UK\u201937 during autumn. For instance, Rosell-Mel\u00e9 et al. (1995) noted that \n\nin the Northeastern Atlantic (2\u00b0S \u2013 75\u00b0N) the alkenones temperature signals \n\nreflect SSTAU rather than SSTAN at 0 m depth. They obtained their SST data from \n\nthe WOA82, and, even though they found the highest correlation at surface, they \n\nsuggested that their surface temperature should be considered not only to the 0 \n\nm depth, but to the mixed layer, since their samples come from a large latitudinal \n\ngradient. \n\nTernois et al. (1996) observed that the production of UK\u201937 in the \n\nNorthwestern Mediterranean Sea takes in the upper water column during autumn \n\nfrom their sediment trap samples, when the production of coccolithophores is \n\nhigher. They suggest that the seasonality and the depth of the alkenones \n\nproduction must be considered when reconstructing SSTs based on UK\u201937, as well \n\nas the interannual viability of the coccolithophores production. Also, Prahl et al. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n29 \n\n(1993) reported that the UK\u201937 signals collected from their sediment traps in the \n\nMediterranean Sea are cold-biased records, influenced mainly by episodic \n\nupwelling events near the coast, which induces to the high productivity of the \n\nalkenones producers. \n\nThe G. oceanica and the E. huxleyi prefer to inhabit nutrient-rich waters \n\n(BOECKEL et al., 2006), and in the study area they bloom mainly during summer \n\n(BRANDINI et al., 2004). The weakest correlation of UK\u201937 with SST occurs during \n\nsummer, which can be a result of habitat competition within the phytoplankton \n\ncommunity. As in the study area, during summer, blooms of diatoms and \n\nmicroflagellates have been previously reported (BRANDINI et al., 1989; \n\nBRANDINI, 1990; CASTRO et al., 2006, BRANDINI et al., 2014).  \n\nThe data from this study suggests that the coccolithophores also bloom \n\nduring summer, once the total alkenones concentration shows its highest \n\ncorrelation with that season. However, the total assemblage of nannoplankton \n\nfrom this study shows that, overall, the E. huxleyi and G. oceanica are not the \n\nmost abundant species in the region, suggesting that there is a seasonal bloom \n\nvariation between diatoms and coccolithophores throughout the year. \n\n It is possible to hypothesize that the coccolithophores that synthesize the \n\nalkenones have habitat advantage during cooler seasons, as the water has lower \n\ntemperatures, as well as lower nutrient content, while other nannoplankton are \n\nmore abundant over them during warm seasons. The same patter has been \n\nsuggested by Dauner et al. (2019). It is possible to suggest that as they dominate \n\nthe environment during cooler seasons, they also record the temperature \n\nconditions of the upper water column, especially the 10 m depth. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.6.2. Which UK\u201937-paleotemperature model is the most suitable for the \n\nSBB? \n \n\n Most of the temperatures inferred from the UK\u201937 based equations applied \n\nin this study show similar results within them. In general, Mueller et al. (1998) and \n\nPrahl et al. (1988) averages are similar to each other, and they both agree well \n\nwith modern SSTAU. Northwards from the SBB, Ceccopieri et al. (2018) used \n\ncore-top samples retrieved in the Campos Basin to observe the similarities within \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n30 \n\nthe temperatures gathered from the WOA13 to the data from UK\u201937. These authors \n\ndetected that the UK\u201937 values reflect colder temperatures, and that the Mueller et \n\nal. (1998) equation is also the most suitable for paleotemperature reconstruction \n\nin the area, reflecting SSTAN. \n\n In this study, the equation that agrees the most with modern temperatures \n\nis the Bayesian equation developed by Tierney and Tingley (2018), as it provides \n\nstrong similar averages when compared to SSTAN. Since the Bayspline equation, \n\ndeveloped by Tierney and Tingley (2018), were proposed to decrease the effector \n\nand slope attenuation of the data. Our results show that this model is more \n\nreliable statistical paleotemperature SST-UK\u201937 estimates. \n\n \n\n1.7. Final Considerations \n \n This study suggests that the signatures of UK\u201937 in the SW Atlantic, \n\nespecially between 22\u00b0S to 27\u00b0S, can be used as paleoceanographic proxies for \n\nreconstructing past sea temperature conditions. The UK\u201937 index responds more \n\nto seasonal SSTs than to annual SSTs. Apparently, in the SBB, the UK\u201937 records \n\ncooler temperatures, especially from the autumn season, which agrees well to \n\nsurface and upper water column sea temperatures. \n\n In the SBB, the inferred SST-UK\u201937 equation that results in more similar \n\ntemperatures to modern SSTs is the Bayspline equation developed by Tierney \n\nand Tingley (2018), providing annual SSTs. For seasonal SSTs, especially SSTAU \n\nestimates, it is suggested to apply the Mueller et al. (1998) equation.  \n\n This study suggests that in regions with low-temperature ranges (~4 \u00b0C), \n\nthe function UK\u201937 versus SSTs works in an exponential relation, and they are \n\nrelated to seasonal temperatures. In order to verify this hypothesis, more \n\npaleotemperature studies with the application of UK\u201937 in subtropical regions \n\nshould be performed.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n31 \n\nCHAPTER 2  \n\n \n\nRegional calibration of marine proxies in the SW Atlantic: A planktonic \n\nforaminifera proxy-based calibration \n\n \n\n2.1. Introduction \n \n\nThe understanding of how climate has varied throughout Earth\u2019s history is \n\na major key to evaluate and comprehend natural climate variations (WEFER et \n\nal., 1999), and to predict future environmental changes (BRADLEY, 2000). The \n\noceans play an important role in climate due to the exchange of heat with the \n\natmosphere (ROSENTHAL, 2007), what makes the reconstruction of past sea \n\nsurface temperatures (SST) one of the main variables to observe past \n\ntemperature changes.  \n\nA method that has been widely used to reconstruct past ocean \n\nhydrographic parameters is the ratio Mg/Ca in planktonic foraminifera tests \n\n(N\u00dcRNBERG et al., 1996; LEA et al., 1999; ELDERFIELD AND GANSSEN, \n\n2000; ANAND et al., 2003; CL\u00c9ROUX et al., 2007; amongst others). Planktonic \n\nforaminifera tests sink to the ocean floor where their tests are commonly found \n\nwell-preserved within the marine sediment (KUCERA, 2007). Past ocean \n\ntemperature and water column structure reconstructions commonly use \n\nindividually or together surface-dwelling species (e.g., Globigerinoides ruber),  \n\nintermediate dwellers species (e.g., Globorotalia inflata), and deep-dwelling \n\nspecies (e.g., Globorotalia truncatulinoides) (ELDERFIELD AND GANSSEN, \n\n2000; WELDEAB et al., 2006; FARMER et al., 2011; CHIESSI et al., 2014, \n\nREYNOLDS et al., 2018, amongst others). \n\n The Mg/Ca ratio in planktonic foraminifera tests is one among many \n\nproxies in paleoceanographic studies for SST reconstructions. The incorporation \n\nof magnesium ions (Mg+2) in the foraminifera calcite is temperature dependent \n\nwhere, during test calcification, as sea temperature increases, the foraminifera \n\ncalcite Mg/Ca ratio increases exponentially (N\u00dcRNBERG et al., 1996; LEA et al., \n\n1999; ELDERFIELD AND GANSSEN, 2000; BARKER et al., 2003; DEKENS et \n\nal., 2002; ANAND et al., 2003;  EGGINS et al., 2003; amongst others). \n\n The Mg/Ca ratio obtained from analysis of the foraminifera tests can be \n\nconverted into temperature using an empirical relationship between Mg/Ca and \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n32 \n\ntemperature (e.g., ANAND et al., 2003, GRAY et al., 2018). Other variables such \n\nas test size, vital effects, salinity, and pH may also influence foraminiferal Mg/Ca \n\n(e.g., ANAND et al., 2003; RICHEY et al., 2012; RIVEIROS et al., 2016). As a \n\nresult, testing the Mg/Ca-SST calibrations in different regions and oceanographic \n\nsettings is highly recommended before interpreting palaeoceanographic results \n\n(ANAND et al., 2003; RICHEY et al., 2012). \n\nThe number of paleoceanographic studies in the SW Atlantic has \n\nincreased recently (e.g., LEDUC et al., 2010; PIVEL et al., 2013; CHIESSI et al., \n\n2014; SANTOS et al., 2014; LESSA et al., 2016; SANTOS et al., 2017). Despite \n\nthe increase in interest and the continuous use of Mg/Ca-based SST estimates, \n\nthe SW Atlantic still lacks calibration studies for the most commonly used \n\nplanktonic foraminifera species (i.e., G. ruber, G. inflata, and G. truncatulinoides). \n\nTwo previous studies performed in the SW Atlantic are related to \n\ncalibration of planktonic foraminifera proxies: G. ruber (white) ?18O calibration by \n\nFranco-Fragas et al. (2011), and the G. inflata SST based Mg/Ca ratio calibration \n\nby Groeneveld and Chiessi (2011). Currently, most of the SW Atlantic \n\npalaeoceanographic studies involving G. ruber (pink and white morphotypes) \n\nSST based Mg/Ca estimates apply the conversion equation suggested by Anand \n\net al. (2003), which was calculated for specimens collected in the North Atlantic.  \n\n Overall, good interpretations of prior SSTs conditions rely on the validation \n\nand accuracy of the analyzing data (LEE et al., 2008), and the lack of regional \n\ninferred Mg/Ca-SST validation may reflect in less robust SST assessments. \n\nHence, testing the paleotemperature equations is essential to improve past \n\ntemperature estimates, providing more reliable results. \n\n Against this background, this study conducted an elemental analysis in \n\nfour planktonic foraminifera species retrieved from 26 core-top samples along the \n\nSouth Brazilian Bight (SBB \u2013 24\u00b0S to 27\u00b0S), SW Atlantic. The ratio Mg/Ca will be \n\nused to test the most applied paleotemperature equation for Mg/Ca-SST \n\nestimates (e.g. ANAND et al., 2003). This is the first comparison based on Mg/Ca \n\nperformed on various size fractions of different planktonic foraminifera species \n\nand variants (e.g. white s.s. and s.l.) in the SW Atlantic. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n33 \n\n2.2. Objectives \n \n\nThe main goal of this chapter was to test the Mg/Ca-paleotemperature \n\nbased equations of different planktonic foraminifera species in different size \n\nfractions from marine surface sediments retrieved from the SBB. From these \n\nanalyses, this is study is aimed to: \n\ni. Generate data from the paleotemperature proxies (e.g. Mg/Ca) in \n\ntests of four species of planktonic foraminifera, and in different size \n\nfractions, from core-top sediment samples collected along the SBB; \n\nii. Compare the Mg/Ca among the selected species/size fractions  \n\niii. Transform the Mg/Ca into temperature and compare to modern \n\nSST to observe what is or is there is a correlation between them; \n\niv. Identify what season the sea temperature has most significant \n\nimpact on the ratio Mg/Ca records in upper water planktonic \n\nforaminifera shells; \n\nv. Compare the SST generated by the Mg/Ca in this study to \n\npreviously published data from the literature; \n\nvi. Verify/Validate if the available paleotemperature coefficients are \n\nadequate for the study area. \n\n \n\nThis validation will inform the reconstruction of past environmental \n\nconditions of SW Atlantic, especially in the Southern Brazilian margin. \n\n \n\n2.3. Study Area \n \n\n \n\nThe samples from this study come from the outer shelf and shelf break of \n\nSBB, ranging the latitudes of 24\u00b0S to 28\u00b0S (Figure 6). Presenting a wide \n\ncontinental shelf, extending from 71 to 231 km wide, the area has an arc-shape \n\nmorphology, and it does not receive significant fluvial discharge (ZEMBRUSKI \n\n1979, MAHIQUES et al., 2004). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n34 \n\n \n\nFigure 6 - Map of the study area and sample locations, as the triangles represent the locations \nwhere the samples were retrieved. The yellow, green and the orange triangles represent the \nContornitos (CTN - FAPESP n\u00b0 2016/03381-3), Pockmarks (PM - FAPESP n\u00b0 2016/22194-0), \nand GEOSEDEx (GEO) projects respectively. \n\n \n\n On the continental shelf, the sediment composition is composed of very \n\nfine sands (MAHIQUES et al., 2004). In offshore areas, the meanders and eddies \n\nformed by the Brazil Current (BC) play a major role in the sediment transport \n\n(SILVEIRA et al., 2000; MAHIQUES et al., 2007), and the sediments are mostly \n\ncomposed of clay and calcium carbonate (MAHIQUES et al., 2004), as well as \n\ncoarse sediments, which are related to the sediment depositions during the \n\nevents of regression of the sea level (MAHIQUES et al., 2011). \n\n The BC is the main current systems that flows on the SBB. This current \n\nflows towards south, and its path goes over the shelf break and continental slope \n\n(CAMPOS et al., 1995; 2000; STRAMMA AND ENGLAND, 1999). The BC \n\ntransports two water masses: the Tropical Water (TW; Temperature > 20?C; \n\nSalinity > 36),  a superficial water mass and it can be recognize for carrying warm, \n\nsalty and oligotrophic waters; and the South Atlantic Central Water (SACW, \n\nTemperature > 6?C &lt;20?C, Salinity > 34.6 and &lt;36), carrying colder, less saline \n\nand nutrient-enriched waters, flowing at the pycnocline levels (MIRANDA, 1985; \n\nSILVEIRA et al., 2000). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n35 \n\n The meanders and eddies that the BC develops is caused because of the \n\nabrupt changes in the coastline orientation along the SBB (CAMPOS et al., 2000). \n\nThese systems flow offshore and their presence lead to the rise of the SACW to \n\nthe photic zone, and resulting in the fertilization of the upper water column \n\n(CAMPOS et al., 1996; 2000; LIMA, 1997; SILVEIRA et al., 2008). \n\n The rise of the SACW changes the spatial variation of sea temperature, \n\nsalinity, nutrients in the upper water column (BRANDINI et al., 1990a; BRANDINI, \n\n2014), modifies the chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration, biomass and \n\nphytoplankton dynamics throughout the SBB (ODEBRECHT AND CASTELLO, \n\n2001; GAETA AND BRANDINI, 2006; BRAGA et al., 2008; BRANDINI et al., \n\n2014). \n\n2.4. Material and Methods \n\n2.4.1. Sample procedures \n\n \n\n Samples from 25 core-tops (5 core-tops in 0 \u2013 0.5 cm, and 20 core-tops in \n\n0 \u2013 1 cm) retrieved with multiple-corer (MUC) and box-corer, from the shelf, outer \n\nshelf and upper slope of the SE Brazilian margin (from water depths of 121 m to \n\n1557 m; latitudes of 24\u00b0S to 27\u00b0S) during three oceanographic cruises conducted \n\non board the R/V Alpha Crucis, from the Oceanographic Institute of the University \n\nof S\u00e3o Paulo (IOUSP), as described in chapter 1 (Figure 6). \n\nThe samples were washed with a 63 \u00b5m mesh and oven dried (T &lt;40\u00b0C). \n\nAfter they were dried, the samples were sieved into different size fractions in \n\norder to obtain the planktonic foraminifera tests that were selected for this study: \n\nG. ruber (morphotypes pink and white s.s. and s.l. in the size fractions of 250 \u2013 \n\n300 \u00b5m and 300 \u2013 355 \u00b5m; G. inflata, within the size fraction of 300 \u2013 425 \u00b5m, \n\nand the G. truncatulinoides right coiling (i.e., dextral), in the size fraction of 380 \u2013 \n\n620 \u00b5m). \n\nThe G. ruber white s.s. and s.l. morphotypes were visually separated \n\nunder a binocular microscope according to the characteristic cited by Wang \n\n(2000) (Figure 7 and Figure 8, respectively). This separation was performed \n\nbecause both white morphotypes present different habitat preferences in some \n\nregions, where the s.l. is a cold-biased species, and shows larger depths \n\nvariation, while the s.s. tends to inhabit the upper depths (WANG, 2000; \n\nSTEINKE et al., 2005). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n36 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7 - Specimens of the G. ruber (w) senso stricto collected from samples of this study.

For this, the tests were observed \n\nunder a binocular microscope (Figure 13 and Figure 14, respectively,  Appendix). \n\nThis separation was determined because, in other regions, the C and NC test \n\nforms have been determined as indicative of calcification at different water depths \n\n(e.g., SPEAR et al., 2011; SALMON et al., 2016; REYNOLDS et al., 2018), and \n\nbecause visual discrimination of both forms can be subjective. More information \n\nregarding the discrimination of both forms is described on appendix.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4.2. Planktonic foraminifera test geochemical analyses \n\n \n\nThe major elements presented in the foraminifera tests (e.g. Mg and Ca) \n\nwere determinated at the U.S. Geological Survey, Coastal and Marine Science \n\nCenter (St. Petersburg, FL, USA), under the supervision of Dr. Julie Richey. For \n\nthese analyses, ~60 tests of all four foraminifera species  were gently crushed \n\nand cleaned according to the cleaning procedures by Barker et al. (2003), which \n\nconsists in the removal of multiple clay minerals, and organic matter that may be \n\nattached into/onto the foraminifera tests by an oxidative step, as well as the \n\nremoval of adsorbed metals by an acid leaching step. After the cleaning \n\nprocedures, the tests were then analyzed on a Perkin Elmer Optima 7300 dual \n\nview inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). \n\nMg/Ca was corrected by using the internal gravimetric standard (IGS) method \n\nafter Schrag (1999). \n\nTo check for removal of clays during the cleaning procedure, samples \n\nwere monitored for peaks of Fe, Mn, and Al. Although the abundance of these \n\nelements in foraminiferal calcite is typically below the detection limits on the ICP-\n\nOES, they may be detected in measurable concentrations if contaminants are \n\npresent. From these elements, it is possible to identify early diagenesis (e.g., Fe \n\nand Mn), as well as contamination of clay minerals (e.g., Al). The samples that \n\npresented high peaks of one or more of these elements, combined with low or \n\nhigh Ca concentration (i.e., &lt;5 ug g-1 and > 30 ug g-1) were excluded from the \n\nstatistical analysis (see RICHEY et al., 2012). Sample replicates were performed \n\nto measure natural variations among sample aliquots and to analyze precision. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n39 \n\n \n\n2.4.3. Data analyses and interpretation \n\n \n\n Modern SST observations were obtained through satellite images (NASA \n\nOcean Color database). Data of sea temperature and salinity of the water column \n\n(0 m, 10 m, 15 m, 20 m and 25 m) was obtained with the World Ocean Atlas 2013 \n\ndatabse (WOA13). \n\n The statistical analysis of the Mg/Ca data were performed on the Past3 \n\nsoftware (version 3.8). For all species, it was tested the normality (Shapiro-Wilk) \n\nto the identification of outliers through boxplot charts. \n\n To verify if the Mg/Ca-derived SST agrees with observed modern SSTs, \n\nthe species-specific (SS) equation and the general species (GE) equation \n\ndeveloped by Anand et al. (2003) were applied for Mg/Ca ratio for all four \n\nforaminifera species. Afterwards, an ANOVA test was performed to determine if \n\nthe paleotemperature equations result in sea temperature averages similar to \n\nmodern SSTs gathered by satellitle images and the WOA13 temperatures. A p-\n\nvalue of 0.5 (at 95% of confidence) was stablished to accept or reject the null \n\nhypothesis (H0), where, in all cases: \n\n \n\n H0: The averages of the Mg/Ca-SSTs are equal to the temperatures \n\nobtained by the satellite and WOA13; \n\n H1: The averages the Mg/Ca-SSTs are different to the temperatures \n\nobtained by the satellite and WOA13. \n\n \n\n When the p-values from the ANOVA test were lower (greater) than 0.5, the \n\nH0 was rejected (accepted). \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n40 \n\n2.5.

Elemental Analysis of Planktonic Foraminifera Tests and Statistical \n\nAnalyses \n\n \n\n The raw Mg/Ca data can be found in Table 20 (Appendix). A summary of \n\nthe results of the ratio for all species of this research can be found in Table 21 \n\n(Appendix), as well as in Figure 11. \n\n The Mg/Ca ratio in the G. inflata species (300 \u2013 425 \u00b5m) averaged 1.78 \n\nmmol/mol (\u00b1 0.16, n = 10), where the highest value was 2.12 mmol/mol, and the \n\nlowest value was 1.53 mmol/mol. \n\n For G. ruber (p) within the size fraction of 250 \u2013 300 \u00b5m, the Mg/Ca ratio \n\naveraged 3.71 mmol/mol (\u00b1 0.32, n = 21), with a maximum of 4.42 mmol/mol, and \n\nminimum of 3.23 mmol/mol. The tests of the 300 - 355 \u00b5m size fraction of G. ruber \n\n(p) showed an average of 3.95 mmol/mol (\u00b1 0.24, n = 23), with a maximum of \n\n4.58 mmol/mol, and a minimum 3.38 mmol/mol. \n\n The G. ruber (w) s.s. species within the 250 \u2013 300 \u00b5m size fraction \n\npresented an average of 4.04 mmol/mol (\u00b1 0.26, n = 7), ranging from 3.74\u2013 4.49 \n\nmmol/mol. For the 300 \u2013 355 \u00b5m size fraction, the average was 4.12 mmol/mol \n\n(\u00b1 0.24, n = 13), and ranged from 3.85\u20134.76 mmol/mol. \n\n For the G ruber (w) s.l. species in the size fraction of 250 \u2013 300 \u00b5m, the \n\naverage of Mg/Ca ratio was 3.89 mmol/mol (\u00b1 0.29, n = 24), ranging from 3.37 \n\nmmol/mol to 4.54 mmol/mol. In the size fraction of 300 \u2013 355 \u00b5m, the G. ruber \n\n(w) s.l. show an average of 3.99 mmol/mol (\u00b1 0.34, n = 16), where the highest \n\nratio was 4.54 mmol/mol, and the lowest ratio was 3.23 mmol/mol. \n\n The non-crusted type of G. truncatulinoides between the size fraction of \n\n380 \u2013 620 \u00b5m presented an average of 1.92 mmol/mol (\u00b1 0.18, n = 16), ranging \n\nfrom 1.68 mmol/mol to 2.36 mmol/mol. The crusted type of G. truncatulinoides \n\n(same size fraction) showed an average of 1.94 mmol/mol (\u00b1 0.17, n = 14), where \n\nthe Mg/Ca ranged from 1.63 mmol/mol to 1.63 mmol/mol. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n43 \n\n \n\nFigure 11 \u2013 Boxplot of Mg/Ca ratio from the species that were analyzed in this research project. \nThe species that inhabit the upper water column show higher Mg/Ca ratio, while species that \ninhabit lower regions of the water column show lower Mg/Ca ratio. The outliers are represented \nas circles. \n\n \n\n The Shapiro-Wilk test suggested that only the G. ruber (w) s.s. species in \n\nthe size fraction of 300 \u2013 355 \u00b5m does not present normality, even after \n\ntransforming it into log scale. Therefore, it was chosen to keep the non-\n\ntransformed data, applying a non-parametric analyses for the interpretations (p-\n\nvalue of the Kruskal-Wallis test). \n\n The t-test suggested that the only species that have significantly different \n\nstatistical means is the G. ruber (p), (p-value of 0.006), where the size fraction of \n\n300 \u2013 355 \u00b5m shows about 0.24 mmol/mol higher than the size fraction of 250 \u2013 \n\n300 \u00b5m species.   \n\n Meanwhile, the other upper water column species do not show difference \n\nwithin their means. The G. ruber (w) s.s. showed a p-value of 0.51 between the \n\nsize fractions of 250 \u2013 300 \u00b5m and 300 \u2013 355 \u00b5m, where the first size fraction has \n\nslightly higher Mg/Ca ratio (0.07 mmol/mol). The mean values between the two \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n44 \n\nsize fraction of G. ruber (w) s.l. morphotype also are not significantly different as \n\nthe p-value of the t-test suggests (p-value of 0.30). The size fraction of 300 \u2013 355 \n\n\u00b5m is slightly higher, showing a 0.10 mmol/mol higher than the 250 \u2013 300 \u00b5m size \n\nfraction. \n\n The crusted and non-crusted tests of G. truncatulinoides (d) species do \n\nnot show the difference in their means as well (p-value of 0.79). Between these \n\ntwo forms, the crusted form has slightly higher Mg/Ca concentration, showing a \n\ndifference of 0.017 mmol/mol between them. \n\n Between the upper water column species (i.e., all the G. ruber species \n\nwithin all size fractions), the Kruskal-Wallis test suggested that there is a \n\nsignificant difference between the averages (p &lt;0.05). On Table 22 it is possible \n\nto see the means that are significantly different between the species that inhabit \n\nthe upper water column fractions. \n\n For the deep-dwelling species, the Kruskal-Wallis test suggested that all \n\nthe means do not show significant difference within them (p-value of 0.95). In fact, \n\nthe test showed that the G. inflata species shows significantly similar Mg/Ca \n\nmeans to the crusted form of G. truncatulinoides (d) (p-value of 0.98). The p-\n\nvalues between these species can be seen in Table 23. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.5.3. Species-specific (SS) and general species (GE) equations to convert \n\nMg/Ca ratios into SSTs  \n\n \n\n In Table 24 (Appendix) and Figure 12 displays all the ratio Mg/Ca \n\nconverted into SSTs for each of the core-top samples from this study. Overall, \n\nthe SS equations shows higher temperatures than the GE equations. Also, for \n\nthe G. ruber species, the Mg/Ca-derived temperature is higher in the larger test \n\nsize. \n\n For the G. ruber (p) within the size fraction of 250 \u2013 300 \u00b5m, when the SS \n\nequation is applied, the resulting SST is 24.4\u00b0C (\u00b1 1.5, n = 21). Meanwhile the \n\nGE equation results in 25.3\u00b0C (\u00b1 1.0, n = 21). The difference between the species-\n\nspecific to the general species equation is 0.9 \u00b0C.  \n\n The SS equation for tests within 300 - 355 \u00b5m of the G. ruber (p) showed \n\nan average of 25.21 \u00b0C (\u00b1 0.91, n = 23), and the GE equations resulted in 26.02 \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n45 \n\n\u00b0C (\u00b1 0.68, n = 23). The SS and the general species equations for this size fraction \n\nhas a difference of 0.81 \u00b0C of temperature between them. When comparing with \n\nthe 250 \u2013 300 size fraction, the SS equations show a difference of 0.84 \u00b0C, while \n\nthe GE equations show a difference of 0.72 \u00b0C between these two size fractions. \n\n The G. ruber (w) s.s. species within the size fraction of 250 - 300 \u00b5m \n\npresented an average of 24.26 \u00b0C (\u00b1 0.59, n = 7) with the SS equation results. \n\nThe GE equation shows an average of 26.26 \u00b0C (\u00b1 0.67, n = 7). The difference \n\nof temperature between the SS and the GE for the white s.s. in this size fraction \n\nis 2 \u00b0C. \n\n For the G. ruber (w) s.s. within size fraction of 300 \u2013 355 \u00b5m, when applied \n\nthe SS equation, it is obtained 25.27 \u00b0C (\u00b1 0.66, n = 13). The GE results in 26.47 \n\n\u00b0C (\u00b1 0.63). In this size fraction, the difference of temperature between the SS \n\nand the GE is 1.19 \u00b0C. When comparing with the previous size fraction, the \n\ndifference between the SS equations is 1.01 \u00b0C, and the GE is 0.21 \u00b0C. \n\n The calculated average using the SS equation for the G. ruber (w) s.l. \n\nspecies, 250 \u2013 300 \u00b5m size fraction, is 23.86 \u00b0C (\u00b1 0.74). This species showed a \n\ndifference of 1.95 \u00b0C when the SS and the GE equations are compared. \n\n In the 300 \u2013 355 \u00b5m size fraction, the G. ruber (w) s.l., the SS equation \n\nresults in 24.89 \u00b0C (\u00b1 1.02, n = 16), while the GE equation shows an average of \n\n26.11 \u00b0C (\u00b1 0.97, n =16). This size fraction showed a difference of 1.21 \u00b0C \n\nbetween the two equations applied. Between size fractions, the SS equations \n\nhave 1.03 \u00b0C of difference between them, and 0.29 \u00b0C for the GE equations. \n\n The temperature obtained with the SS equation for the G. inflata species \n\n(300 \u2013 425 \u00b5m) averaged 21.42 \u00b0C (\u00b1 1.56, n = 10). The highest temperature with \n\nthis equation was 23.34 \u00b0C, and the lowest was 18.49 \u00b0C. While, the GE equation \n\nresults in an average of 18.11 \u00b0C (\u00b1 1.01, n = 10), where the highest temperature \n\nwas 19.35 \u00b0C, and the lowest was 16.23 \u00b0C. \n\n The non-crusted type of G. truncatulinoides, 380 \u2013 620 \u00b5m size fraction, \n\nwith the SS equation resulted in 18.64 \u00b0C (\u00b1 1.03, n = 16). The GE equation \n\nresulted in 18.01 \u00b0C (\u00b1 1.03, n = 16). The difference of temperature between the \n\nSS and the GE equations estimates for the G. truncatulinoides NC is 0.63 \u00b0C. \n\n The average calculated after the SS equation for the crusted type of G. \n\ntruncatulinoides (380 \u2013 620 \u00b5m) is 18.74 \u00b0C (\u00b1 0.97), and the GE equation \n\nresulted in 18.11 \u00b0C (\u00b1 0.97, p =14).

The \n\nSS equation for G. ruber (p), 300 \u2013 355 \u00b5m size fraction, tests showed an average \n\nsignificantly similar to SSTAU (25.21 \u00b0C, \u00b1 0.91, n = 23, p-value of 0.71), while the \n\nGE equation results do not show any significant averages with annual or seasonal \n\nSST. Yet, its average is 26.02 \u00b0C (\u00b1 0.68, n = 23, p-value &lt;0.05), which is close \n\nto SSTSU. \n\n The G. ruber (w) s.s., 250 \u2013 300 \u00b5m size fraction, SS equation presented \n\nan average significantly similar to the SSTAN (p-value of 0.20), while the GE \n\nequation results have similar averages to SSTSU (p-value of 0.21). Both equations \n\nof the G. ruber (w) s.s., 300 \u2013 355 \u00b5m size fraction, show significant similarities \n\naverages with SSTAN and SSTSU, respectively (p-value of 0.86 and p-value of \n\n0.55). On the other hand, the calculated average using both equations of the G. \n\nruber (w) s.l., 250 \u2013 300 \u00b5m size fraction, shows no siginficant similar averages \n\nto any modern SST. However, both calculated temperatures are still in the \n\nmodern range of SST (23.86 \u00b0C and 25.81 \u00b0C, respectively), which are close to \n\nSSTWI and SSTAU temperatures, respectively. For the G. ruber (w) s.l., 300 \u2013 \n\n355 \u00b5m size fraction, the SS equation and the GE equation show significant \n\nresults with SSTAU and SSTSU, respectively (p-value of 0.21 for both). \n\n The temperature obtained with the SS equation for the G. inflata species \n\n(300 \u2013 425 \u00b5m) show a strong simlarity with annual SSTs at 10 m depth (p-value \n\nof 0.89).

Discussion \n\n2.6.1. Shallow-dwelling planktonic foraminifera from the SBB core-top \n\nsamples and their Mg/Ca based-SST estimates   \n\n \n\nComparing the core-top Mg/Ca-SSTs with observed temperatures is \n\nimportant to determine how accurately the Mg/Ca proxy reflects local SST \n\n(HERTZBERG et al., 2013), and to identify where in the water column the \n\nforaminifera calcifies. Overall, the Mg/Ca-inferred SSTs averages obtained in this \n\nstudy showed consistent results when compared to modern SSTs. The results of \n\nthis study shows that there are differences on the ratio Mg/Ca between the \n\nsurface and subsurface species.  \n\nThe data suggest that the SS and the GE equation by Anand et al. (2003) \n\nresult in different Mg/Ca-SSTs, such that the SS equation results in colder \n\ntemperatures than the GE equation. Therefore, the discussion will be based on \n\nthe results that showed the strongest similarities between the Mg/Ca-derived \n\ntemperatures and the observational temperatures (e.g. highest p-values). \n\nOverall, for the G. ruber species, the larger size fraction had significantly \n\nhigher Mg/Ca. Between the two size fractions of the pink form, there is a \n\nsignificantly difference between both averages (0.24 mmol/mol, p &lt;0.05; Table \n\n25). On the other hand, even though in other regions the G. ruber (w) seems to \n\nhave different incorporation of Mg+2 in their tests, the data from this study \n\nsuggests that there is no significant difference on the Mg+2 and Ca+2 uptake by \n\nG. ruber (w) morphotypes and their size fractions (p > 0.05; Table 25). \n\nPast studies have reported the increase in Mg/Ca with increasing test size \n\nfor the pink form (RICHEY et al., 2012; FRIEDRICH et al., 2013), as well as the \n\nlack of difference in the Mg/Ca content in their white forms without discriminating \n\nthen into s.s. and s.l. forms (RICHEY et al., 2012). In general, these studies \n\nhypothesize that foraminifera grow larger in warmer waters. Furthermore, the pink \n\nforms seem to calcify in shallower/warmer conditions than the white forms, which \n\nwas also observe previously (e.g. RICHEY et al., 2012). More recently, Richey et \n\nal. (2019) stated that the larger tests of G. ruber are more abundant in warmer \n\nmonths, and smaller sizes, specially the white form, in colder months. The \n\ndifferent test sizes seem to have different seasonal preferences, which may be \n\nthe reason of the difference between test size and the uptake of Mg/Ca. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n49 \n\nSousa et al. (2014) reported that in their plankton tow off the Brazilian SE \n\ncontinental margin, during summer, the G. ruber pink was the most abundant \n\nspecies among the surface-dwelling species, inhabiting the first 20 meters of the \n\nwater column. The G. ruber white species was also present and abundant in the \n\nfirst 20-meter depth, but, in some stations, they found them within 40- to 60-meter \n\ndepth, and between 80- to 100-m depth. According to these authors, the depth of \n\nthe mixed layer affects the presence and abundance of both species in the area. \n\nConverting the Mg/Ca into SSTs, the data from this study suggests that \n\nthe smallest size of the pink form yields SSTAN estimates, while the s.s. form is \n\nmore likely to reflect SSTSU temperatures. The s.l. form, however, did not show \n\nany strong similarity with any observational SST, but their results are closely to \n\nSSTWI temperatures. Within the bigger size fractions, all both pink and s.s. form \n\nreflect SSTAU. The s.l., is high related to both SSTAU and SSTSU estimates. forms, \n\nreflect SSTSU. \n\nIn this study, the pink form within the biggest size seems to calcifies in 0.7 \n\n\u00b1 0.4 \u00b0C warmer temperatures than the smallest size. This data that is presented \n\nhere is consistent when compared to previous studies, where it was observed a \n\nsignificant difference in Mg/Ca-temperatures between the size fractions of the \n\npink form only (RICHEY et al., 2012; FRIEDRICH et al., 2013), where the authors \n\nrelated the increase on temperature estimates with the increase of size to depth \n\nwhere the calcification of the tests takes place, which is influenced or by summer-\n\nweighted seasonal distribution or shallower depth habitat. \n\nIn general, the G. ruber is believed to be a summer-biased species, and \n\nthe white forms an annual-biased species (KEMLE-VON-MUCKE AND \n\nHEMLEBEN, 1999; SCHIEBEL AND HEMLEBEN, 2017), where the s.l. type \n\ntends to record colder temperatures than the s.s. form (WANG, 2000; STEINKE \n\net al., 2005). The results from both WOA13 and the satellite images show the the \n\nSST in autumn has warm temperatures, and it is not warmer than summer time \n\nonly. The largest sizes show strong similarities in temperature averages with the \n\nSSTAU and SSTSU, which agree with previous statements. The white forms also \n\npresent the increase on Mg/Ca according to shell size, but with no statistically \n\ndifference between them. Yet, the s.l. within the smallest size is the one who \n\nderives the lowest temperatures within all shallow species. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n50 \n\nTherefore, it is possible to suggest that, in the SBB, the smallest size of \n\nthe pink forms inhabit the upper water column throughout the year, showing no \n\nseasonal preference; the s.s. form seems to calcifies in shallower waters, and it \n\nis a summer-biased species; the s.l. form is a cold-biased species, and it seems \n\nto relate more to winter time. The biggest sizes also seem to inhabit shallower \n\nwaters, and all of them are warm-biased species, especially during autumn. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.6.2. The Mg/Ca based-temperatures derived from deep-dwelling \n\nplanktonic foraminifera species in the SBB: What are the G. inflata and the \n\nG. truncatulinoides (d) forms recording in their Mg/Ca content? \n\n \n\nThe G. inflata and the G. truncatulinoides (d) are deep-dwelling species \n\n(up to 400 m depth; GROENEVELD AND CHIESSI; FRANCO-FRAGAS, 2011), \n\ninhabiting greater depths in the water column than the G. ruber species (up tp 50 \n\nm; SOUSA et al., 2014). Also, the forms crusted and non-crusted of the G. \n\ntruncatulinoides can be used to trace different water depth habits with the crusted \n\nforms tending to record colder temperatures than the non-crusted form (e.g. \n\nSPEAR et al., 2011; SALMON et al., 2016; REYNOLDS et al., 2018). \n\nThe data of this study shows that the G. inflata species have high \n\ntemperature similarities with annual temperatures at 10 m depth (~20 \u00b0C) (Table \n\n26). This is very differently from presented by Groeneveld and Chiessi (2011) \n\nhave found on their core-top samples collected in the South Atlantic (ranging from \n\n8 \u00b0S to 49 \u00b0S). These authors reported that the G. inflata ranges from 8 to 16 \u00b0C, \n\nand it calcifies ~ 387 m depth, recording permanent thermocline conditions. In \n\nthe North Atlantic, Cl\u00e9roux et al. (2007) reported that the G. inflata for their core-\n\ntop samples seem to respond to the base of the thermocline (&lt;100 m depth), \n\nand that these species migrate to deeper waters when temperatures at high \n\ndepths are above 16 \u00b0C. \n\nThe data from this study shows great similarities with temperatures in \n\nmuch shallower depths than Groeneveld and Chiessi (2011), but much more \n\nsimilar to what Cl\u00e9roux et al. (2007) have found. An explanation for the difference \n\nbetween the data from this study to Groeneveld and Chiessi (2011) results is that \n\nthe samples retrieved in this study come from shallower depths than them. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n51 \n\nGroeneveld and Chiessi (2011) retrieved their samples in open water (> 3000 m), \n\nand they have a large latitudinal gradient and, therefore, larger temperature \n\ngradients as well. \n\nThe samples from this study come mainly from the continental slope, which \n\nis much shallower. This area is highly influenced by meander and eddies caused \n\nby the Brazil Current, which uplifts the SAWC, the colder and nutrient-rich waters \n\nto shallower depths (SILVEIRA et al., 2000; CAMPOS, 2000; SILVEIRA et al., \n\n2008). Therefore, in the SBB on continental slope areas, the G. inflata seems to \n\nrecord annual temperature conditions at 10 m depth, as well as the influence of \n\nthe vertical migration of the SAWC to the surface. The data reported in this study \n\nagrees with what Cl\u00e9roux et al. (2007) have reported to the North Atlantic. \n\nThe G. truncatulinoides (d) forms do not show any statistically differences \n\non Mg/Ca in their tests. There is no difference as well when comparing the ratio \n\nfrom the G. inflata species to both C and NC forms of the G. truncatulinoides (d). \n\nEven though only the C form shows a weak similarity with summer temperatures \n\nat 20 m depth, the NC form does not show averages too different from the crusted \n\nform. \n\nCl\u00e9roux et al. (2008) found that the G. truncatulinoides and the G. inflata \n\nhave similar calcifying depth preference. The data from this study shows that the \n\ndifference of temperatures between both species is ~2 \u00b0C. In addition, both forms \n\nseem to fit in the SACW thermal structure (SILVEIRA, 2000). \n\nThe NC form is closely related to annual temperatures at 20 m depth, while \n\nthe C form is weakly related to the summer temperatures at 20 m. The difference \n\nbetween both forms have been discussed in previous studies (SPEAR et al., \n\n2011; SALMON et al., 2016; REYNOLDS et al., 2018). In this study, the Mg/Ca \n\nand temperatures are not statistically different from both forms. However, the NC \n\nseems to calcify in different conditions than the C form. The Figure 15 shows how \n\nrelated all the foraminifera analyzed in this study are to one another. Clearly the \n\nNC form fits into the surface species component (from here called warm-biased \n\ncomponent), while the C and the G. inflata fit the second component (cold-biased \n\ncomponent). \n\nThe same trend has been reported by other studies in different areas. \n\nSpear et al. (2011) analyzed the geochemical signs of G. truncatulinoides in the \n\nnorthern Gulf of Mexico, and they found that the C forms calcify in deeper and \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n52 \n\ncooler waters, whereas the NC forms record winter mixed layer conditions. \n\nSalmon et al. (2016) noticed that in the Sargasso Sea, the C forms in their \n\nsamples calcifies in much deeper depths throughout winter, and that the NC in \n\ncalcifies surface waters, even at 0 m depth. Reynolds et al. (2018) used tests \n\nfrom sediment traps, and they also observed the different geochemical signals \n\nbetween both forms. \n\nAll these authors related their results to the ontogeny and life cycle of the \n\nG. truncatulinoides forms, where, as the test becomes more matures, it migrates \n\nto deeper waters and evolves a secondary crust (encrustation) around the test \n\nwith a different chemistry composition.  \n\nIn this study, the Mg/Ca ratios and temperatures are not statistically \n\ndifferent from both forms. However, the G. truncatulinoides (d) NC form seems to \n\ncalcify in different conditions than the G. truncatulinoides (d) C form. The G. \n\ntruncatulinoides (d) NC form clearly fits into the surface species component (from \n\nhere called warm-biased component), while the G. truncatulinoides (d) C and the \n\nG. inflata fit the second component (cold-biased component). Additionally, the G. \n\ninflata and both forms of the G. truncatulinoides (d) seem to reflect the SACW \n\nintrusion into the photic zone. The G. inflata and the G. truncatulinoides (d) C \n\nform seem to prefer to inhabit the thermal layer of the SACW, since their signals \n\nfits exactly in these temperatures (~16 \u00b0C), and the G. truncatulinoides (d) NC, \n\nseems to inhabit the upper base of the SACW (~18 \u00b0C), once it fits in-between \n\nsurface and subsurface-dwelling species.  \n\nIn summary, the G. inflata and the G. truncatulinoides (d) tests in this study \n\ncan be used to trace the vertical variation of the SACW in the SBB, especially the \n\nG. truncatulinoides (d) C form. The G. truncatulinoides (d) NC form seems to \n\ninhabit depths quite shallower than the C form. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n53 \n\n2.7. Final Considerations \n \n\n The Mg/Ca based-temperatures derived from all the planktonic \n\nforaminifera species (G. ruber (p), G. ruber (w) s.s., G. ruber (s) s.l., G. \n\ntruncatulinoides (d) and G. inflata) analyzed in this study agree well with modern \n\nocean temperatures. Our data suggests that in in different size fractions the \n\ntested species respond differently to the most used species-specific and general \n\nspecies paleotemperature equations. Therefore, in order to improve the accuracy \n\nof future SST reconstructions, it is suggested to analyze what equation fits better \n\nin the area of the interest. \n\n In the SBB, the most suitable equation for the G. ruber (p) species, in both \n\nthe 250 - 300 \u00b5m and 300 - 355 \u00b5m size fractions, is the species-specific \n\nequation. Using this equation, the G. ruber (p) tests in the smallest size fraction \n\nreflect mean SSTAN conditions, while in largest size fraction tests reflect SSTAU. \n\nThe Mg/Ca based-SST estimates derived from the 250 - 300 \u00b5m size fraction G. \n\nruber (w) s.s. tests show significant results with modern SSTSU at 0 m, when the \n\nGE equation is applied, while for the 300 - 355 \u00b5m size fraction, the SS equation \n\nreflects SSTAU at 0 m. For the G. ruber (w) s.l. only the largest size fraction (300 \n\n- 355 \u00b5m) tests present similarity with modern ocean SST, and both equations \n\nreflect SSTAU and SSTSU conditions at 0 m; the smallest size fraction in this G. \n\nruber (w) morphotype can be used to trace cold-seasons, especially SSTWI at 0 \n\nm. \n\n The deep-dwelling species studies seem to reflect the uplift of the SACW \n\ninto the surface waters in the SBB. The G. inflata apparently calcifies at 10 m \n\nwater depth, and it can be used to trace the upwelling of the SACW, while the G. \n\ntruncatulinoides (d) C form records the downwelling of the SACW during autumn \n\n(~20 m water depth), and the G. truncatulinoides (d) NC form records mean \n\nannual temperature in deeper water conditions. \n\n This is the first study to report Mg/Ca ratios in surface-dwelling (G. ruber) \n\nand deep-dwelling (G. inflata and G. truncatulinoides (d)) planktonic foraminifera \n\ntests obtained in core-top samples in the SBB. This validation of the planktonic \n\nforaminifera Mg/Ca ratio conversion to temperature SS and GE equations for the \n\nsurface-dwelling (G. ruber), and deep-dwelling (G. inflata and G. truncatulinoides \n\n(d) species in the SBB, will help to improve the accuracy of future temperature \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n54 \n\nreconstructions in the area. Also, to evaluate the suggestions made by this study, \n\nit is recommended to perform sediment trap analyses along the SBB. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n55 \n\n3. Appendix \n\n3.1. The discrimination of the G. truncatulinoides (d) Crusted and Non-\n\ncrusted forms \n\n \n\nG. truncatulinoides (d) were discriminated into crusted (C) and non-\n\ncrusted (NC) forms for the Mg/Ca analyzes. For this, the tests were observed \n\nunder a binocular microscope. This separation was determined because, in other \n\nregions, the C and NC test forms have been determined to calcify at different \n\nwater depths (e.g., SPEAR et al., 2011; SALMON et al., 2016; REYNOLDS et al., \n\n2018), and because visual discrimination of both forms can be subjective.  \n\nOnce the C and NC tests were separated, every single NC test was \n\nmeasured across the diameter of the umbilical side, from the tip of the final \n\nchamber to the opposite side, as described by Reynolds et al. (2018) (Figure 13). \n\nAfter taking notes of the NC test lengths, they were individually weighed on a \n\nmicrobalance. This test was performed to observe if the C and NC G. \n\ntruncatulinoides (d) tests have a distinct exponential length-weight relationship, \n\nas observed by Reynolds et al. (2018) in the Gulf of Mexico, where the NC tests \n\nare mostly lighter than the C tests. It is important to highlight that only a few C \n\ntests were measured and weighed after the first test with the NC tests. \n\nElectron images of a few tests of the discriminated C and NC forms were \n\ntaken at the Electron Microscopy Laboratory at the University of South Florida, \n\nSt. Petersburg (USFSP), in St. Petersburg, FL (USA) (Figure 14). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n56 \n\n \n\nFigure 13 \u2013 Specimen of G. truncatulinoides (d) being measured under a binocular microscope. \nThe scale was calibrated as every single mark equals to 20 \u00b5m. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n57 \n\n \nFigure 14 \u2013 Specimens of the G. truncatulinoides (d) picked from samples of this study.

The mean weight of the tests within this size fraction was 36.93 \n\n\u00b5g (\u00b1 9.52, n = 359), as the lightest test weighed 12.5 \u00b5g and the heaviest test \n\nweighed 61.6 \u00b5g.  \n\n The NC tests of the size fraction between 355 \u2013 425 \u00b5m presented a mean \n\nof 540 \u00b5m in their length (\u00b1 40.66, n = 202), where the test with the largest length \n\nmeasured 620 \u00b5m and the smallest test measured 400 \u00b5m. The weight of this \n\nsize fraction showed a mean of 52.82 \u00b5g (\u00b1 10.88, n = 202), where the lightest \n\ntest weighed 22.7 \u00b5g, and the heaviest test weighed 78.2 \u00b5g. \n\n In the size fraction of 380 \u2013 620 \u00b5m, the length average was 498.32 \u00b5m (\u00b1 \n\n46.67, n = 561), as the smallest length was 380 \u00b5m and the biggest was 620 \u00b5m. \n\nThe weight in this size fraction means 42.65 \u00b5g (\u00b1 12.60, n = 561), as the lightest \n\ntest weighted 12.5 \u00b5g and the heaviest weighted 78.2 \u00b5g. \n\n For the C forms, the length ranged from 420 \u00b5m to 580 \u00b5m (\u00b1 48.26, n = \n\n24), and the weight ranged from 23 \u00b5g to 68.2 \u00b5g (\u00b1 12.22, n = 24). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n59 \n\n \n\nFigure 15 \u2013 Scatter plot of the length-weight relationship between the crusted (C) and non-crusted \n(NC) tests of G. truncatulinoides (d) of this research and from Reynolds et al. (2018). Besides \npresenting a low correlation between length and weight, the tests of this research project are \nlocated between the division of the C and NC tests observed by Reynolds et al. (2018). \nConsequently, the length-weight relationship cannot be applied to separate the C from NC tests \nin this research. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe NC tests of G. truncatulinoides (d) do not present a significant \n\ndifference between the both sieved size fractions (p > 0.5). For this reason, the \n\ntests were placed as a single size fraction (300 \u2013 425 \u00b5m), corresponding to the \n\nsmallest test length to the largest length (380 \u2013 620 \u00b5m) measured. Once it was \n\ndecided to assemble the tests of G. truncatulinoides (d) in one size fraction (300 \n\n\u2013 425 \u00b5m), a batch of crusted tests form (C) (n = 24) was also measured and \n\nweighed to observe the length-weight relationship between the tests. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.1.3.

(2018) (Figure 15). The length-weight \n\ncorrelation of C and NC tests found in this research are considerably low, where \n\nthe R2 of NC length-weight was 0.49, and the R2 of C length-weight was 0.39. \n\nR\u00b2 = 0.4924R\u00b2 = 0.6884\n\nR\u00b2 = 0.3957\n\nR\u00b2 = 0.7314\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n4.4 4.9 5.4 5.9 6.4 6.9\n\nW\ne\nig\n\nh\nt \n\n(\u00b5\ng\n)\n\nln(Length) (\u00b5m)\n\nThis research (NC) Reynolds et al.

(2018) found a high length-weight correlation between their G. \n\ntruncatulinoides (d) C and NC tests (R2 = 0.73 and R2 = 0.68, respectively), which \n\nmakes possible to differentiate the C and NC mathematically, avoiding visual \n\nerrors.  \n\n This high correlation observed in this study may be linked to the fact that \n\nReynolds et al. (2018) picked the most extreme examples of C and NC tests that \n\nwere collected with a sediment trap and preserved in formalin. Thus, their tests \n\nhave not sunk into the bottom of the ocean, and, consequently, they did not \n\nundergo any type of post-depositional process. \n\n Apparently, in the SBB, the C and NC tests may have more aggregated \n\nmaterial (such as crust and clay minerals) in their structures, as they sank into \n\nthe bottom, which makes difficult to separate the C from NC tests as Reynolds et \n\nal. (2018) had performed. Differently than Reynolds et al. (2018), the samples of \n\nthis research come from core-tops retrieved with a multiple-corer. These \n\naggregate material can be a result of the long exposure of the sediments with the \n\nsediment-water interface, since the sedimentation rates in the SBB are lower than \n\n2 to 68 cm. kyr-1 (MAHIQUES et al., 2011). As a consequence, we conclude that \n\nthese metrics derived from sediment-trap samples may not be applicable in \n\nmarine sediments.  \n\n The G. truncatulinoides (d) tests for this research were, then, visually \n\nseparated as C and NC under a binocular microscope taking as a reference to \n\ndistinct them the color, brightness, opacity and the presence or absence of crust \n\naround the tests. \n\n Therefore, it is suggested that in the SBB, for paleoceanographic studies \n\nusing post-depositional material, to segregate the C and NC forms of the G. \n\ntruncatulinoides species should be performed under a visual separation instead \n\nof the mathematical way, since the tests do not agree well with the length-weight \n\nrelationship. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n
