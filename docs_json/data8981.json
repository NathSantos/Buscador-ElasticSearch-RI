Agr\u00edc., Jaboticabal, v.33, n.2, p.303-311, mar./abr. 2013 \n\n304 \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nThe environmental adaptation in hydrographic basins is important to comply with federal \n\nlegislation of the Brazilian Constitution (BRAZIL, 1988). In Article n\u00ba 225, this Constitution report \n\nthat \"Everyone has the right to an ecologically balanced environment and of common use and \n\nessential to a healthy quality of life, belonging to the Government and society the duty to defend \n\nand preserve it for present and future generations. \" \n\nThe Forest Code, Federal Law n\u00ba 4,771/65 (BRAZIL, 1965), defines that the area of \n\npermanent preservation (APP) is the area covered or not by native vegetation, with the \n\nenvironmental function of preserving water resources, landscape, geological stability, biodiversity, \n\ngene flow of fauna and flora, to protect soil and ensure the well being of human populations. This \n\ncode also includes riparian forests in the category of areas of permanent preservation. Thus, all the \n\nnatural vegetation, arboreal or not, present along the river banks and around sources and reservoirs \n\nshould be preserved. \n\nCONAMA Resolution n\u00ba 303/02 (BRAZIL, 2002), which also discuss about parameters, \n\ndefinitions and boundaries of APP, in the 3\nrd\n\n Article, says that the APP consists in the area located: \n\nI - in marginal strip, measured from the highest level in horizontal projection, with a \n\nminimum width of: thirty meters to the watercourse with less than ten feet wide; \n\nII - around the source or waterhole, even if intermittent, with minimum radius of fifty meters \n\nin such a way that protects, in each case, the contributory hydrographic basin. \n\nThus, denoting the importance of the APPs, with the function of protecting the natural \n\nenvironment, this means that they are not appropriate areas for land use, and should be covered with \n\nnative vegetation. The vegetal coverage in these areas will mitigate the effects of erosion and \n\nleaching of soils, contributing to regulation of water flow, reducing sedimentation of watercourse \n\nand reservoirs, bringing benefits to the fauna and flora. \n\nFor reforestation and recovery of degraded areas we have the Resolutions SMA 21 of 2001 \n\nand SMA 47 of 2003, and the most current, Resolution SMA 08 of 2008 (SMA, 2001, 2003, 2008), \n\nwhich fix the orientation for heterogeneous reforestation of degraded areas. In Resolution SMA of \n\n2008, there is an attachment that contains a list of the arboreal species and an indication of its \n\nnatural biomes / ecosystems and ecological regions of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo (SMA, 2008). \n\nThe analysis of the land use and occupation in an area is the first step to guide an effective \n\nmanagement regarding the means for the development of conservation practices, in common with \n\nfarming practices, and economic development with less impact to the environment. OLIVEIRA et \n\nal. (2008); DELALIBERA et al. (2008) and NASCIMENTO et al. (2006), conducted studies aiming \n\nto develop maps of land use based on satellite images to identify conflicts of uses, having as \n\nreference the Brazilian Forest Law. The surveys were developed around the National Park of \n\nCapara\u00f3 in the state of Minas Gerais, in Ponta Grossa - in the state of Paran\u00e1 and the hydrographic \n\nbasin of the Alegre River, located in the southern of the state of Esp\u00edrito Santo. The geoprocessing \n\nresources were the basis for mapping classes of land use, to contemplate the requirements of Areas \n\nof Permanent Preservation, regarding to the occurrence of sources and riparian vegetation. \n\nVALLE JUNIOR et al. (2010) report that a hydrographic basin is geographically a system \n\ndefined with great diversity of environments where they develop different economic activities, \n\nwhich have a direct effect on vegetation, soils, topography, water bodies and biodiversity in general. \n\nThis study aimed to set photographic standards representing the evaluation of the use and \n\noccupation of the source of Rico Stream, located in Monte Alto - S\u00e3o Paulo (SP), Brazil. The \n\ninformation obtained will be the basis for a database on territorial unit of hydrographic basin, for \n\npurposes of environmental adaptation regarding the Brazilian Forest Law. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nEnvironmental adaptation of the source of the subbasin of Rico Stream, Monte Alto - SP, Brazil \n\nEng. Agr\u00edc., Jaboticabal, v.33, n.2, p.303-311, mar./abr. 2013 \n\n305 \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\nThe study was performed at the spring drainage of the Rico Stream subbasin, and it was \n\nconsidered as the territorial unit of work, the main set of sources of the stream or region of higher \n\naltitude. The area has an extension of 2,141.53 ha, corresponding to 3.95% of the hydrographic \n\nbasin of Rico Stream and located between the geographical coordinates of latitude 21\u00b016'04''S and \n\n21\u00b020'49''S and longitude 48\u00b027'42''W Gr. and 48\u00b031'19''W Gr., whose source begins at the Rico \n\nStream including its route until the junction with the Gl\u00f3ria Farm Stream, in Monte Alto - SP.  \n\nThe main soil types found in the studied area are the Red-Yellow Argisols (PVA3), the Red-\n\nYellow Argisols (PVA4) and Litholic Neosols (EMBRAPA, 1999). The climate, according to \n\nK\u00f6eppen, is classified as humid mesothermal of hot summer and dry winter (Cwa type), and the \n\nannual rainfall ranges from 1,100 mm to 1,700 mm. The average annual relative humidity is \n\napproximately 71%, occurring concentration of rainfall during the period of October to March and \n\nthe dryer season extends from April to September. The predominant forest formation type consists \n\nof the semi-deciduous forest. \n\nThe study was based on visual analysis of images taken by the Panchromatic Sensor, installed \n\naboard the Satellite WorldView 1, dated in October 2005, at scales of approximately 1:15,000 in \n\nPanchromatic band and quadrants P001, P002 and P003 on the current area. The topographic maps \n\npublished by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e \n\nEstat\u00edstica - IBGE, 1971), at scale 1:50,000, vertical equidistance between curves of 20m level were \n\nused as auxiliary in the delimitation of various characteristics of the study area and mainly as a \n\npoint of planialtimetric support of drainage net and the location of the hydrographic microbasin. \n\nThe sheets used were IBGE topographical maps, at scale 1:50,000, the areas surrounding the maps \n\nin question are: Tai\u00fava (SF-22-X-III-1), Pirangi (SF-22-X-D-II-2) Jaboticabal (SF-22-X-D-III-3) \n\nand Taquaritinga (SF-22-X-D-II-4). \n\nAs equipments, it was used computer system compatible for image analysis. The maps were \n\ndrawn with georeferenced control points for mobile and fixed receivers TRIMBLE GPS and tuned \n\nto American NAVSTAR artificial satellites. The Mark of Reference (base station) for data \n\ncollection with GPS receivers was the geodesic mark of the Department of Rural Engineering of \n\nFCAV/UNESP. \n\nFor the digitalization, junction of the maps and graphical representation of the area it was \n\nused the AutoCad2008 program, which is a graphic design software, having vector files. For \n\nprocessing the data collected in the field for georeferencing it was used the Program GPSurvey. The \n\ndetails of this study were transferred to the base map, establishing the geographical distribution and \n\ngeneral representation of the area. \n\nFor the preparation of the map of use/occupation of the area with remote sensing data visually \n\ninterpreted and to extract the information of the image was determine the elements of the image \n\nrecognition. The methodology was based on the analysis of visual patterns identified on aerial \n\nphotographs, which were: shape, size, shadow, tone/color, pattern, texture, location and aspects \n\nrelation, adapted from the studies by AMARAL (1998) and ENDRES (2006). These characteristics \n\nare summarized in Table 1. \n\n\n\nTeresa C. T. Pissarra, Aline B. Marcussi, Gilberto da R. Le\u00e3o et al. \n\nEng.

The measurements of the areas were performed \n\nusing the AutoCad program, where the areas of each polygon of different uses and occupations \n\nwere measured, being adopted as unit of measure the hectare (ha). \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nAs a result of the analysis of images in cartographic documents was identified the \n\nhydrographic net and the natural and agricultural plant communities (Figures 1 and 2). \n\n\n\nEnvironmental adaptation of the source of the subbasin of Rico Stream, Monte Alto - SP, Brazil \n\nEng.

Le\u00e3o et al. \n\nEng. Agr\u00edc., Jaboticabal, v.33, n.2, p.303-311, mar./abr. 2013 \n\n308 \n\nIn Figure 1 we can observe that the area presents a net of drainage branched with minor \n\nextensions, forming a region with a number of about 70 sources. This fact proves that the region of \n\nthe city of Monte Alto - SP, present an interesting geological region of topographic divide, and have \n\nan immeasurable wealth of water, which supplies a large portion of the population and various \n\ncities, reinforcing the importance of preserving these water sources in the area and the city as a \n\nwhole, supporting the study of PISSARRA et al. (2009). \n\nThe grazing areas (Figure 2) comprises the areas of clean pasture-field, whose primary \n\ndifference from other analyzed coverage is the identification of the creeping appearance of the plant \n\ncommunity installed, even when conditions of drained cultivated plain without identification of \n\nchannel. In dirty field, the presence of irregular and sparse herbaceous vegetation is intercepted as \n\nabandonment of pasture area. The areas of clean field match with the presence of pasture in the \n\nform of culture, introducing granular texture much thinner and uniform than the areas of dirty field. \n\nThese areas are predominantly located along the drainage net. \n\nThe cultures present defined geometric shapes, in strips and variable aspect according to the \n\nage. Perennial cultures found in the hydrographic basin, such as orchards of guava, mango and \n\ncitrus have regular geometric shape and highlighted contour. The structure of plants is arranged in \n\ndefined, regular and individualized alignments, and rough to medium texture and dark green \n\ntonality (Figure 2). \n\nThe other cultures have geometric shape with expression of varied contour, with low \n\noccurrence of carriers, having disordered structure and varied tonalities depending on the time of \n\ndevelopment. Regarding to the aspects, it was identified lines of level and terrace and the presence \n\nof geometric shapes that characterize the circular central pivot usually present in the onion culture, \n\nas noted in the field (Figure 2). The culture of sugarcane is predominant. This culture is distributed \n\nin relatively large areas, cut by carriers, with at least two stages of development, regular geometric \n\nshapes, flat, continuous and homogeneous roof. The grown sugarcane presented rougher texture \n\nthan the new sugarcane with tonality of medium to light green, respectively. The structure was \n\nformed by the set of plots delimited by carriers which stand out to the associated aspects (Figure 2).  \n\nThe areas with infrastructure called rural buildings correspond to houses, sheds, barns and \n\nother farm buildings, with their surroundings with trees or clean. The dam areas correspond to the \n\nlimits of the water surface along the drainage net, where there was the extremity with dam or in \n\npond form (Figure 2).  \n\n \n\nTABLE 2.

Map of the environmental dynamic of the spring of drainage of the hydrographic \n\nmicrobasin of Rico Stream - SP/2005. \n\n \n\nWhen preparing the legend of Figure 2 and 3 it was used information from the visual \n\ninterpretation of the images, the areas of arborous vegetation or forest comprise the areas of \n\nreminiscent forest, characterized by irregular borders and variable aspect with formation dominated \n\nby arboreal elements, composed of three layers of vegetation, with rough texture and dark green \n\ncolor. \n\nGenerally, these formations were found near watercourses or near rivers and in areas with \n\nmore accentuated slopes, in areas where the topography and soil type limit the use of agricultural \n\ncultures. \n\nThe global set of data presented (Table 2 and Figure 2) confirms that the cultivation of \n\nsugarcane is the main form of land use in the spring of the hydrographic microbasin, with 26% of \n\nthe total area, over the citrus, guava and mango orchards, with 9%, and onion with only 2%, \n\ncultures that previously occupied the largest area of the subbasin. \n\nThe permanent crops presented higher expression in more irregular areas, associated with the \n\npresence of Argisols, and the onion and sugarcane plantations were concentrated in flatter areas. In \n\nthe analyzed period, we denote the advantage presented by the economic culture of sugarcane. With \n\nthe proximity of some sugar and alcohol mills, the sugarcane culture is occupying the space that \n\nwas once occupied by other crops, especially perennial cultures such as citrus, guava and mango \n\nand annual traditional culture of the region, the onion. \n\nAnother important fact is the low percentage of reforestation observed in the area, which is of \n\n1.46 ha. It is noteworthy that there is 375.04 ha of areas of permanent preservation and 302.87 ha of \n\nthese are not preserved, i.e. it was analyzed only 72.17 ha (19.24% of the areas of permanent \n\npreservation) is composed of arborous vegetation or forest. \n\n\n\nTeresa C. T. Pissarra, Aline B. Marcussi, Gilberto da R. Le\u00e3o et al. \n\nEng. Agr\u00edc., Jaboticabal, v.33, n.2, p.303-311, mar./abr. 2013 \n\n310 \n\nThe predominantly more irregular relief occurs in Argisols PVA3 and PVA4 (wavy to strong \n\nwavy relief) and the same was observed by PISSARRA (2006). The spring microbasins have a \n\nhigher degree of evolution of the hydrographic basin. In the region of the springs of drainage are all \n\nthe microbasins of 2nd order of magnitude likely to transport material on a larger scale, tending to \n\nlower resistance to removal of the surface mantle, with more intense erosion process. The \n\ncomplexity is exacerbated in the subbasins of the sources of the Tijuco and Gamb\u00e1 Streams near the \n\ncity of Monte Alto and source of Rico Stream. These data reinforce the importance of preserving \n\nthe APP and the need for environmental adaptation of the spring of drainage, avoiding negative \n\neffects of human disturbance, such as erosion, siltation of rivers and other problems on water and \n\nsoil quality of the area. \n\nAlthough they are areas of permanent preservation, protected by State and Federal legislation \n\n(OLIVEIRA et al., 2008; DELALIBERA et al., 2008 and NASCIMENTO et al., 2006), the riparian \n\nforests, cultivated plain areas and forest fragments of slope are suffering significant changes. The \n\nintense and disordered devastations are leading to the disappearance of several species of ecological \n\nand commercial importance, with serious impairment of their genetic potential. \n\nAs noted, the panorama of areas of forests is critical, including forests, cerrados and fields. \n\nWhen there is change in this scenario and there is an environmental analysis of previously degraded \n\narea recovery, it is necessary to highlight and ennoble this fact (VALLE JUNIOR et al., 2010). \n\nThe manual survey and mapping has high accuracy due to the rigorous detailing adopted in \n\nthe data survey of land use and occupation, drainage net and arboreal vegetation in APPs, providing \n\nmaximum approximation of the reality of the area, and therefore it is perfectly suited for small areas \n\nand regions with predominantly small farmers because it allows proposed models of adaptation \n\neconomically viable. \n\nThe data concerning the land use and occupation, drainage net and environmental dynamics \n\nof the hydrographic microbasin of the Rico Stream enable to conclude that there is a real need to \n\npreserve the area in question not only for its rich water resources, but also because of the \n\naggravating factors as: strongly marked relief, soil type susceptible to erosion and low percentage of \n\nvegetation in areas of permanent preservation. Thus, the study and analysis of the spring area of the \n\nmicrobasin have the data for future models of proposed environmental adaptation in accordance \n\nwith the current environmental legislation. \n\n \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\nThe study area present a surface of 2,141.53 ha and the results allowed to prove that the main \n\nculture is of sugarcane with 546.34 ha, followed by pastures with 251.22 ha, perennial cultures with \n\n191.71 ha, Eucalyptus with 57.31 ha and onion with 49.52 ha of the total area. There are 375.04 ha \n\nof areas of permanent preservation.
