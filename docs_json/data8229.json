This thesis \n\nwas challenging in every way, academically and personally. Since the very beginning, several \n\nimportant decisions had to be made, but luckily for me, I had the support of one very important \n\nperson, to whom I am greatly thankful. Alexandra Rosa, my life partner, you were always there \n\neven when at 933 km distance. This path was shared by both of us, because I know that these times \n\nweren\u2019t a walk in the park for you neither. To think that this thesis was hard only on me would be \n\nextremely selfish, and for all your support, your strength, your joy, and many more other things \n\n(the list is quite big), I thank you from all my heart.  \n\nTo my family, you are the ones to whom I dedicate this work. Without your patience and your \n\nsupport for all my decisions, this would only be an \u201cif\u201d. The truth is that every step and direction I \n\ntook lead me here, and you always had my back. For that, I am internally thankful. An especial \n\nmessage to my mom, who gave me strength in all ways possible \u2013 even with a simple cup of tea \n\nwhen working in the middle of the night. Sometimes, every small gesture counts. To my father, \n\nwho despite all things, always gave me company. To my brother, your wise words gave me serenity \n\nduring stressful times. You had a different approach than mine when you were in my place, and it \n\nworked pretty well!  \n\nTo my supervisors, I thank Dr. Rui Caldeira for the orientation, the motivation, the wise words \n\nand of course for the opportunity to study the Cape Verde Archipelago at the Oceanic Observatory \n\nof Madeira (OOM). To Dr. Paulo Relvas, who opened the first door of the project, many thanks \n\nfor your revision, your comments, your attention and your good will.  \n\nTo the staff of the OOM, many thanks for the insights (in colormaps and many other things!) \n\nand more importantly for the moments of laughter.  \n\nTo Prof. Joaquim Lu\u00eds for the insights in handling the Wind datasets, to Prof. Alexandra Cravo \n\nfor the wise advises and to Prof. Jos\u00e9 Jacob for the good conversations.  \n\n Finally, to all my friends who always provided me kind words and motivation along the way, \n\nan especial thanks to C\u00e1tia Freitas, Andr\u00e9 Silva, \u00c9lvio Esc\u00f3rcio, Mauro Gama, Gustavo Vieira, \n\nRicardo Correia, R\u00faben Gouveia and many others.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nii \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\n \n\nThe characterisation of the mesoscale eddy field within and around the Cape Verde \n\nArchipelago is presented. Special attention is regarded towards the far-field (incoming) and the \n\nnear-field (island-induced) eddies, along with the mechanisms and processes influencing their \n\ngeneration and evolution. Consequent implications in the local biological primary production \n\n(Island Mass Effect, or IME) are also assessed. This is achieved by combining remote-sensing \n\nsatellite observations for wind, ocean surface currents, ocean surface topography, clorophyll a \n\nsurface concentrations and sea surface temperature. Results show that the interaction between far-\n\nfield eddies and the archipelago is a recurrent phenomenon, which results in eddy transformation, \n\neddy termination, eddy splitting, and eddy deflection. Local island-induced disturbances are also \n\nsignificant, mainly by atmospheric effects. Such processes result in the generation and confinement \n\nof mesoscale eddies, more often observed in the leeward group. However, the distinction between \n\nisland-induced and far-field processes is hindered by the complex interaction between both fields. \n\nThus, it is strongly suggested that many of the near-field eddies are a direct product or a by-product \n\nof such interaction. This is even more obvious in the assessment of the IME. Far-field eddies are \n\noften associated with enhanced Clha concentrations. However, nutrient-injection by island-induced \n\ncyclonic eddies also gives rise to phytoplankton blooms. As the remote and island-driven biological \n\nenhancement are remarkably intertwined, such observations challenge the idea that local biological \n\nproductivity in deep oceanic islands are exclusively driven by island-induced mechanisms.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKey Words: Cape Verde, Mesoscale Eddies, Eddy-island interaction, Island Mas Effect, Remote \n\nEnrichment. \n\n\n\niii \n\n \n\nResumo \n\n \n\nO arquip\u00e9lago de Cabo Verde \u00e9 um sistema de oceano profundo constitu\u00eddo por 10 ilhas, \n\nlocalizado no Oceano Atl\u00e2ntico Nordeste a ~600 km da costa ocidental Africana. O arquip\u00e9lago \n\ndivide-se em dois grupos principais: as ilhas de Barlavento, s\u00e3o aquelas localizadas mais a norte; \n\ne as ilhas de Sotavento, localizadas mais a sul. Esta regi\u00e3o \u00e9 caracterizada por um sistema oce\u00e2nico \n\naltamente din\u00e2mico, em que as correntes de superf\u00edcie s\u00e3o regidas pelo deslocamento sazonal da \n\nZona de Converg\u00eancia Intertropical (ZCIT). Para al\u00e9m disso, a costa ocidental Africana \u00e9 \n\ncaracterizada como uma das \u00e1reas biologicamente mais produtivas do mundo, como consequ\u00eancia \n\ndo afloramento costeiro, que por sua vez segue o mesmo comportamento sazonal atmosf\u00e9rico. A \n\nintera\u00e7\u00e3o destes dois sistemas faz com que o arquip\u00e9lago esteja consideravelmente exposto a \n\nprocessos remotos, que n\u00e3o s\u00e3o gerados no arquip\u00e9lago, mas ainda assim podem ter implica\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nna oceanografia local. Embora estes processos tenham sido extensivamente estudados no passado, \n\na integra\u00e7\u00e3o do arquip\u00e9lago no contexto regional foi raramente alcan\u00e7ada. O arquip\u00e9lago pode \n\ntamb\u00e9m induzir perturba\u00e7\u00f5es no ambiente, principalmente pelo efeito de barreira na circula\u00e7\u00e3o \n\natmosf\u00e9rica provocado pela topografia de alta altitude. Consequentemente, estas perturba\u00e7\u00f5es \n\npodem provocar processos oce\u00e2nicos localizados, muitas vezes na forma de v\u00f3rtices oce\u00e2nicos \u2013 \n\nconhecidos na g\u00edria cientifica como eddies. Por sua vez, estes eddies s\u00e3o conhecidos por induzir \n\nimpactos a n\u00edvel biol\u00f3gico, sendo at\u00e9 respons\u00e1veis por impulsionar a produtividade prim\u00e1ria local. \n\nEste fen\u00f3meno tem como designa\u00e7\u00e3o \u201cEfeito de Massa de Ilha\u201d. A gera\u00e7\u00e3o de eddies induzidos \n\npelas ilhas e consequente impacto biol\u00f3gico t\u00eam sido cada vez mais alvo de estudo um pouco por \n\ntodo o mundo, principalmente no Havai, na Ilha da Madeira e nas Can\u00e1rias. Curiosamente, estas \n\nilhas partilham muitas das caracter\u00edsticas que s\u00e3o favor\u00e1veis para a ocorr\u00eancia deste fen\u00f3meno com \n\no arquip\u00e9lago de Cabo Verde. No entanto, e tendo em conta o conhecimento existente sobre Cabo \n\nVerde, o acontecimento de tais processos tem sido visto apenas como especulativo. \u00c9 tamb\u00e9m \n\nextremamente importante notar que os eddies de campo distante \u2013 aqueles que s\u00e3o criados fora da \n\n\u00e1rea de Cabo Verde, mas que intersectam esta mesma \u00e1rea durante o seu tempo de vida \u2013 podem \n\nter implica\u00e7\u00f5es significativas na gera\u00e7\u00e3o de eddies de campo pr\u00f3ximo \u2013 aqueles que s\u00e3o criados \n\ndentro da \u00e1rea do arquip\u00e9lago \u2013 (supostamente) induzidos pelas ilhas. Por\u00e9m, tal intera\u00e7\u00e3o nunca \n\nfoi tomada em considera\u00e7\u00e3o em estudos desta natureza.  \n\n\n\niv \n\n \n\nPosto isto, duas hip\u00f3teses s\u00e3o propostas para o presente estudo: podem os eddies de campo \n\ndistante ter implica\u00e7\u00f5es nos processos f\u00edsicos e biol\u00f3gicos de ilhas oce\u00e2nicas, que at\u00e9 \u00e0 data foram \n\nnegligenciados? E, se for o caso, de que forma podem as ilhas impactar estes eddies de campo \n\ndistante? De modo a responder a estas perguntas, a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o do campo de eddies ao redor e \n\nna \u00e1rea de Cabo Verde \u00e9 apresentado, dando especial aten\u00e7\u00e3o aos eddies de campo distante e aos \n\neddies de campo pr\u00f3ximo. Para tal, foram utilizados v\u00e1rios par\u00e2metros ambientais, tais como o \n\nvento, correntes oce\u00e2nicas de superf\u00edcie, topografia da superf\u00edcie do oceano, concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\nsuperf\u00edcie de clorofila a (Chla), e temperatura da superf\u00edcie do oceano. Estes dados foram medidos \n\npor dete\u00e7\u00e3o remota, a partir de sensores a bordo de v\u00e1rios sat\u00e9lites, que s\u00e3o de acesso livre. Ap\u00f3s \n\na sua obten\u00e7\u00e3o, os dados foram processados a partir de scripts desenvolvidos no MatLab. Tendo \n\nem conta a natureza explorat\u00f3ria do estudo, foi primeiro realizada uma an\u00e1lise preliminar com o \n\nobjetivo de determinar processos regionais que possam ter um impacto direto no arquip\u00e9lago, e \n\nassim delinear o seguimento das an\u00e1lises a serem realizadas, assim como a estrutura do trabalho. \n\nSubsequentemente, foi adotado um procedimento mais detalhado, de modo a evidenciar os \n\nmecanismos e processos a uma escala local. Para al\u00e9m da classifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos eddies de acordo com \n\na origem, foi tamb\u00e9m designada uma classifica\u00e7\u00e3o com base no tempo de vida, em que: eddies de \n\ncurta vida s\u00e3o aqueles que n\u00e3o ultrapassam os 30 dias; eddies de m\u00e9dia vida s\u00e3o aqueles que n\u00e3o \n\nultrapassam os 60 dias; e eddies de longa vida s\u00e3o aqueles que ultrapassam os 60 dias.  \n\nDe acordo com o conhecimento existente, os resultados demonstraram consistentemente que \n\no arquip\u00e9lago se enquadra numa regi\u00e3o oce\u00e2nica extremamente complexa, altamente influenciada \n\npela din\u00e2mica atmosf\u00e9rica induzida pelo comportamento sazonal da ZCIT. Como esperado, este \n\ncomportamento reflete-se tanto a n\u00edvel regional, bem como local. Os locais de maior gera\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\neddies de m\u00e9dia e longa vida foram identificados a sul das ilhas com maior altitude do arquip\u00e9lago \n\n(Fogo e Santo Ant\u00e3o), refor\u00e7ando o papel dos efeitos atmosf\u00e9ricos na gera\u00e7\u00e3o de eddies. No \n\nentanto, foi tamb\u00e9m demonstrado que o arquip\u00e9lago est\u00e1 exposto a um n\u00famero consider\u00e1vel de \n\neddies de campo distante, que interagem com as ilhas e com os processos induzidos pelas mesmas. \n\nEste tipo de intera\u00e7\u00e3o traz implica\u00e7\u00f5es significativas, n\u00e3o s\u00f3 para os eddies de campo pr\u00f3ximo, \n\nmas tamb\u00e9m para a propaga\u00e7\u00e3o e evolu\u00e7\u00e3o dos eddies de campo distante. Desta forma, observou-\n\nse que os poss\u00edveis cen\u00e1rios de tal intera\u00e7\u00e3o foram (do mais recorrente para o menor): deforma\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndos eddies incidentes; destrui\u00e7\u00e3o dos eddies; divis\u00e3o dos eddies incidentes e consequente gera\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde novos eddies de campo pr\u00f3ximo; e deflex\u00e3o dos eddies induzida pela topografia das ilhas.  \n\n\n\nv \n\n \n\nConsiderando a quantidade substancial de evid\u00eancias que suportam a ocorr\u00eancia sistem\u00e1tica \n\ndesta intera\u00e7\u00e3o entre eddies de campo distante e as ilhas de Cabo Verde, concluiu-se que grande \n\nparte dos eddies de campo pr\u00f3ximo sejam um produto ou subproduto deste processo. Por esta raz\u00e3o, \n\n\u00e9 muito dif\u00edcil determinar a natureza dos eddies gerados no arquip\u00e9lago, i.e., se s\u00e3o gerados por \n\nmecanismos f\u00edsicos induzidos pelas ilhas, pela intera\u00e7\u00e3o entre eddies de campo distante com as \n\nilhas, ou at\u00e9 mesmo intera\u00e7\u00e3o de eddies de campo distante com eddies de campo pr\u00f3ximo. \n\nEste tipo de intera\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 ainda mais \u00f3bvio na caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o biol\u00f3gica do arquip\u00e9lago. Foi \n\nposs\u00edvel observar que os eddies de campo distante est\u00e3o frequentemente associados a n\u00edveis de \n\nChla elevados, que por sua vez est\u00e1 relacionado com o local de origem \u2013 a costa ocidental Africana. \n\n\u00c0 medida que estes eddies intersectam as ilhas, a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o superficial de Chla aumenta \n\nconsideravelmente, atuando assim como enriquecimento remoto. Al\u00e9m disso, os eddies cicl\u00f3nicos \n\ncriados pelas ilhas s\u00e3o capazes de injetar \u00e1gua rica em nutrientes de camadas profundas para a zona \n\neuf\u00f3tica, favorecendo assim comunidades fitopl\u00e2nct\u00f3nicas e originando o aparecimento de \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es elevadas de Chla junto \u00e0s ilhas. No entanto, estes dois mecanismos distintos s\u00e3o na \n\nmaior parte das vezes vistos a atuar simultaneamente, o que dificulta a diferencia\u00e7\u00e3o entre \n\nenriquecimento remoto do enriquecimento local. Estes resultados desafiam a ideia de que a \n\nprodutividade biol\u00f3gica em ilhas oce\u00e2nicas profundas \u00e9 exclusivamente induzida por mecanismos \n\nassociados \u00e0s perturba\u00e7\u00f5es das ilhas no ambiente ao seu redor.   \n\nAssim sendo, o presente estudo demonstra que a combina\u00e7\u00e3o de processos de campo distante \n\ne de campo pr\u00f3ximo s\u00e3o as principais causas na gera\u00e7\u00e3o de eddies de mesoescala no arquip\u00e9lago, \n\nque por sua vez t\u00eam implica\u00e7\u00f5es importantes a n\u00edvel biol\u00f3gico. Tais observa\u00e7\u00f5es fazem com que o \n\nArquip\u00e9lago de Cabo Verde seja um local perfeito para o estudo deste tipo de intera\u00e7\u00e3o, motivando \n\nassim futuros estudos. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPalavras Chave: Cabo Verde, Eddies de Mesoescala, Intera\u00e7\u00e3o Eddy-ilha, Efeito de Massa de \n\nIlha, Enriquecimento Remoto.  \n\n\n\nvi \n\n \n\nIndex \n\nAcknowledgments _____________________________________________________________ i \n\nAbstract ____________________________________________________________________ ii \n\nResumo _____________________________________________________________________ iii \n\nIndex _______________________________________________________________________ vi \n\nFigure Index _________________________________________________________________ ix \n\nTable Index ________________________________________________________________ xiv \n\nList of Acronyms and Abbreviations _____________________________________________ xv \n\n1.

Introduction \n\nOceanic islands are common geological features in the world\u2019s oceans and are of considerable \n\nscientific interest in the present days. They can be found in shallow waters \u2013 known as continental \n\nislands, or in deep waters \u2013 known as oceanic islands (Wallace, 1892). Normally of volcanic origin \n\nand far from the nearest continent, oceanic islands contrast from continental islands in the sense \n\nthat the latter type are an integrated element of the continental shelf and, as a consequence, are \n\ncommonly found near the continent of origin. Naturally, the environment in which islands are \n\ninvolved determine with great significance its geomorphology and its biological patterns. On the \n\nother hand, an island can induce significant physical perturbations in the background atmospheric \n\nor oceanic flow, which in turn must have direct impacts in the biological realm (Barton, 2001; \n\nBasterretxea et al., 2002).  \n\nContinental islands are more susceptible to coastal oceanic processes than oceanic islands due \n\nto its proximity to the coast. Thus, one may expect that isolated oceanic islands are not so \n\nbiologically productive as continental islands. This is not entirely true, as there are several cases of \n\nisolated islands \u2013 mainly in the pacific \u2013 that exhibit enhanced levels of primary production and an \n\nexceptional number of endemic species (e.g., Doty and Oguri, 1956; Seki et al., 2001; Palacios et \n\nal., 2006, Andrade et al., 2014; Gove et al., 2016). The specific reasons for why waters surrounding \n\nisolated islands are so productive in presumably oligotrophic waters has been subject to a lot of \n\ndebate over the years. After sailing for weeks in the vast open ocean aboard the HMS Beagle, \n\nDarwin was perplexed when he came across what he believed to be one of the most diverse \n\necosystems on the planet \u2013 coral reefs (Darwin, 1842). How could such a dynamic ecosystem \n\nteeming with life exist in a seemingly unproductive environment? This is now well known in the \n\nscientific community as Darwin\u2019s paradox. Since then, several studies have focused on the \n\ninvestigation of the unexpected biological productivity in such systems, giving rise to the concept \n\nof Island Mass Effect (IME).  \n\nIME was first introduced by Doty and Oguri (1956) as an increase in Chlorophyll \n\nconcentration in the Hawaiian archipelago. Subsequently, this concept was generalized to include \n\nbathymetry-induced island effects on the local oceanography (Hamner and Hauri, 1981) and its \n\nconsequent impact on the biological domain (Caldeira et al., 2005). Many studies managed to \n\ncreate a valid physical - biological relationship, and island-induced flow perturbations can be as \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\ndiverse as: the formation of island wakes that result from the blocking of atmospheric or current \n\ninflow and can extend several island diameters downstream (e.g. Barkley, 1972; Hern\u00e1ndez-Le\u00f3n, \n\n1991; Caldeira and Marchesiello, 2002; Ch\u00e9rubin and Garavelli, 2016); geophysical vortices \u2013 \n\nknown as eddies \u2013 that stir and enhance vertical mixing in the wakes (e.g. Hamner and Hauri, 1981; \n\nSeki et al. 2001; Coutis and Middleton, 2002; Hasegawa et al. 2009); fronts and filaments (e.g. \n\nCaldeira et al., 2002; Barton et al., 2004); upwelling processes \u2013 other than eddies \u2013 that bring \n\nnutrients to the euphotic zone (e.g. Aristegui et al., 1994; Rissik et al., 1997; Palacios et al., 2002; \n\n2004; Hasegawa et al. 2004); among others (Elliot et al., 2012). Whilst these processes are thought \n\nto be the major contributors for IME, the latter can still be fuelled by several land-born factors, \n\nnamely: the input of macro and micronutrients from island runoff (Sander and Steven, 1973; \n\nDandonneau and Charpy, 1985; Bell, 1992; Elliot et al., 2012) and groundwater discharges (Hwang \n\net al., 2005; Tait et al., 2014; Gove et al., 2015; Moosdorf et al., 2015); contributions from benthic \n\nprocesses (Doty and Oguri, 1956; Dandonneau and Charpy, 1985); or even the combination of \n\noceanic mechanisms with land-born factors (Signorini et al., 1999; Palacios, 2002; Martinez and \n\nMaamaatuaiahutapu, 2004). For this reason, it is very important to clarify the nature of the \n\nmechanisms that drive the IME, but more importantly, one should not neglect the regional context \n\nand the far-field impacts to which an island may be exposed to. \n\nFrom the physical point of view, IME has been extensively reported in the most various places \n\n(e.g., Jones, 1962; Ar\u00edstegui et al., 1997; Heywood et al., 2000; Perissinotto et al., 2000; Caldeira \n\net al., 2002; Seki et al., 2001; Andrade et al., 2014). Such studies are remarkably consistent \n\nbetween each other, in the sense that similar methods follow similar patterns and usually arrive to \n\nsimilar conclusions. However, the integration of islands in the regional context was seldom \n\nachieved, as very few studies successfully linked local island effects to remote enrichment through \n\nfar-field features (e.g. Barton et al., 1998, 2004; Palacios, 2004, Caldeira and Jesus, 2017).  Hence, \n\ntwo hypotheses are proposed: can far-field features have considerable implications on oceanic \n\nislands and associated physical/biological processes, that have been neglected to present date? And \n\nif so, to what extend can islands impact such far-field features? \n\nCape Verde is a typical group of deep ocean islands disposed in a non-linear orientation, \n\nlocated near the north-western African coast (~600 km) in a hydrographically complex region, \n\nstrongly affected by seasonal atmospheric dynamics (L\u00e1zaro et al., 2005). In its vicinity, the Canary \n\nCurrent Upwelling System is one of the four large systems of Eastern Boundary Currents (Hagen, \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\n2001, Chaigneau et al., 2009) and is considered one of the biologically most productive oceanic \n\nregions in the world (Pradhan et al., 2006; Pastor et al., 2008; L\u00f6scher et al., 2015). The latter is \n\nmarked by the presence of several mesoscale features that can possibly have a profound effect on \n\nthe regional oceanography, such as: filaments, that extend out to hundreds of kilometres from the \n\nadjacent coast to offshore (Van Camp et al., 1991; Gabric et al., 1993; Kostianoy and Zatsepin, \n\n1996; Lange et al., 1998); and eddies, that can have considerable impacts in the ocean (e.g., \n\nChaigneau et al., 2009; Karstensen et al., 2015; L\u00f6scher et al., 2015; Fiedler et al., 2016; Hauss et \n\nal., 2016; Sch\u00fctte et al., 2016a; 2016b). Several other studies strived to identify and explain the \n\nnature of many oceanic features in the region (e.g. Zenk et al., 1991; L\u00f6scher et al., 2015; Hauss \n\net al., 2016), but all failed to integrate the Cape Verde Archipelago in the regional context, as well \n\nas the archipelago\u2019s impact on the far-field incoming features.  \n\nIn what concerns the near field, Chavanne et al. (2002) were able to demonstrate for the first \n\ntime theoretical evidences of a shadow effect induced by the islands topography, when a wake of \n\nweak winds, flanked by strong winds, was observed in the lee of all the major islands. It is now \n\nwell established that this mechanism may drive the generation of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies \n\nin the island(s) wake (Calil et al., 2008; Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2008; Yoshida et al., 2010; Jia et al., 2011; \n\nCouvelard et al., 2012; Caldeira et al., 2014), which in turn must have direct implications in the \n\nbiological realm (e.g., Ar\u00edstegui et al., 1997; Barton et al., 2000; Seki et al., 2001; Coutis and \n\nMiddleton, 2002). Yet, the archipelago lacks empirical observations that support such \n\nphenomenon. Most likely as a consequence of the wind shadowing effect, L\u00e1zaro et al. (2005) \n\nidentified a nearly permanent anticyclonic eddy south-southwest of the islands, which was more \n\npronounced during the periods of strongest wind intensity (Varela-Lopes and Molion, 2014). The \n\nfar-reaching implications of the archipelago were also introduced by Chavanne et al. (2002), as the \n\nauthors suggested that the island-induced blocking of atmospheric flow could originate a zonal \n\ncounter-current, following the same nature as the thoroughly described Hawaiian-Lee Counter \n\nCurrent (HLCC) (Qiu et al., 1997; Lumpkin, 1998; Xie et al., 2001). Other similar observations \n\nconducted at a regional scale further reinforce such hypothesis (e.g. Chelton et al. 2004; Chaigneau \n\net al., 2009), though none had the specific objective of investigating the archipelago. \n\nAll things considered, one may arrive to the conclusion that the archipelago\u2019s exposure to \n\nregional dynamics, as well as the interaction between atmospheric and oceanic processes at a local \n\nscale, are important factors that to the present date are very poorly understood. Hence, the \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\ninvestigation of such mechanisms is of utmost importance. The current study aims to fill this gap \n\nand thus better comprehend the relation between the far and near-field which affect the Cape Verde \n\nIslands. Special attention is regarded towards the nature and the interaction between the incoming \n\nand locally-generated eddies and, as a complementary investigation, the biological implications of \n\nsuch physical mechanisms are assessed, focusing in the analysis of surface Chlorophyll a (Chla) \n\nconcentrations in the vicinity of the islands.  \n\nThis project is organised as follows: In the next sub-chapters, a brief introduction to the \n\nmechanisms in study is presented, in which eddies (in general), island-wakes and island-induced \n\neddies are described. In Chapter 2, a literature review concerning the geographical setting is \n\nconducted, elucidating the reader to the physical background which affects the archipelago. In \n\nChapter 3, the description of the datasets characteristics and processing methods is conducted. In \n\nChapter 4, the best-suited results are presented and are subsequently discussed in Chapter 5. Lastly, \n\nthe final conclusions are discussed in Chapter 6.  \n\n1.1. Oceanic Eddies \n\nIt has been well established that oceanic eddies (hereinafter referred as eddies) are ubiquitous \n\nfeatures in the world\u2019s oceans (Robinson, 2010). Basically, an eddy is defined as a self-rotating \n\ncoherent body of water (Talley et al., 2011), which propagates through the ocean mostly from self-\n\nadvection and planetary vorticity effects (Cushman-Roisin et al., 1990; Chelton et al., 2011), \n\nthough several other factors can influence their propagation (e.g., Simmons and Nof, 2000; \n\nCenedese et al., 2005; Andres and Cenedese, 2013). These features can range between a few \n\nkilometres, to tens (sub-mesoscale) or even hundreds (mesoscale) in diameter, and are categorised \n\naccording to their rotational flow (Talley et al., 2011). In the northern (southern) hemisphere, \n\ncyclonic eddies flow in the counterclock (clockwise) direction, while anticyclonic eddies flow in \n\nthe clockwise (counterclockwise) direction (Tomczak and Godfrey, 1994). Due to the effect of \n\nearth\u2019s rotation (also known as the Coriolis force), cyclonic eddies are characterised by a \n\ndepression and negative sea surface anomaly at its core, while anticyclonic are associated with an \n\nelevation and consequent positive sea surface anomaly. With the advent of new technologies \u2013 \n\nespecially satellite-based remote-sensing instruments \u2013 these features have been increasingly focus \n\nof investigation (Robinson, 2010), and it is now common knowledge that they can have profound \n\nimplications in the physical, chemical and biological properties of the ocean (Robinson, 2010). \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nSuch features are reported to be the one of the major sources of kinetic energy in the oceans \n\n(Richardson and Walsh,1986). Furthermore, they can transport water in their cores for long \n\ndistances (Alpers et al., 2014, Romero et al., 2016), being even able to go across frontal zones \n\n(Barton, 1987). Depending on its nature (cyclonic or anticyclonic) and place of origin, these waters \n\ncan have considerably different properties in relation to the surrounding waters. In that sense, \n\neddies are able to create and sustain their own distinct environment, which can be characterised by: \n\nnutrient-rich waters from upwelling regions, that under favourable condition enhance biological \n\nproductivity even in presumably oligotrophic regions (L\u00f6scher et al., 2015, Romero et al., 2016), \n\nand are thus potentially favourable for fish larval survival which in turn can act as a medium for \n\ntransportation and colonization (Condie and Condie, 2016); oxygen-depleted waters that create \n\n\u201cdead-zones\u201d in the middle of the ocean (Karstensen et al., 2015, Hauss et al., 2016; Sch\u00fctte et al., \n\n2016b); among many others.  \n\nApart from the horizontal advection of water, eddies can induce vertical fluxes in their interior \n\n(Ar\u00edstegui et al., 1997; Gaube et al., 2013). As such, upwelling (downwelling) occurs in cyclonic \n\n(anticyclonic) eddies due to the divergent (convergent) movement of water at the surface because \n\nof the Coriolis force, which uplifts (deepen) the thermocline and thus enhances (decrease) nutrient \n\navailability through self-induced Ekman-suction (pumping) mechanisms (Lin et al., 2010; Gaube \n\net al., 2013). For cyclonic eddies, this mechanism is an important source of cold, nutrient-rich water \n\nto the euphotic zone (Gaube et al., 2013), which in turn benefits the primary production and drives \n\nthe local increase of Chla at the surface (Alpers et al., 2014, Romero et al., 2016). Subsequently, \n\nthe latter favours the gathering of grazers and predators, acting as an \u201coases\u201d in the open ocean \n\n(L\u00e9vy et al., 2001; Lin et al., 2010; Hauss et al., 2016). In contrast, anticyclonic eddies do exactly \n\nthe opposite, as they inject water from surface to deeper layers. Eddies generation can be induced \n\nby the most diverse physical mechanisms in the ocean, such as: topography effects (Barkley, 1972; \n\nHeywood et al., 1990; Alpers et al., 2014); current shear (Chelton et al., 2011; Sch\u00fctte et al., \n\n2016a); ocean-atmosphere interaction (Calil et al., 2008; Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2008; Coulevard et al., \n\n2012; Hogg et al., 2016); or even eddy-eddy interaction (Sangr\u00e0 et al., 2009; Chelton et al., 2011). \n\nHowever, one of the most interesting mechanisms in the generation of eddies is the island-induced \n\nprocesses, which deserve especial attention in the current study.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\n1.2. Island Wakes and Island-induced Eddies \n\nAn island, or a group of islands, can produce distinctive signatures in the environment around \n\nthem. One of the most characteristic features are known as island wakes and the subsequent eddy \n\ngeneration, typically streaming away in a dominant direction concomitant to the background wind \n\nor current flow (Robinson, 2010). It is important to note, however, that there are different ways to \n\nperceive such features.  \n\nFrom the oceanographic point of view, there are two types of islands disturbances (Tomczak, \n\n1998). One occurs in shallow stratified shelf seas, where the current is clearly dominated by a tidal \n\nregime that moves water in both directions and gets blocked by the island bathymetry, generating \n\na wake in the opposite side of the impinging flow (e.g., Pingree and Maddock, 1980; Hamner and \n\nHauri, 1981; Heywood et al., 1990). Another takes place both in shallow and deep water, when a \n\nclear dominating flow passing an island generates a wake or zone of flow disturbance that can \n\nextend several island diameters, ultimately leading to the generation of eddies (e.g., Barton et al., \n\n2000; Caldeira et al., 2005). The scale of the eddies at their initial phase is normally not far from \n\nthe diameter of the island which provoked it (Dong and McWilliams, 2007; Sangr\u00e1 et al., 2009), \n\nwith the exception when two identical vortices merge and create one eddy with the double diameter \n\nand rotation velocity of the original (Barton, 2001). Barkley (1972) introduced the first empirical \n\ncase study of an island wake and consequent island-induced eddies through observations of fishing \n\ngear drift and surface currents measurements at Johnston Atoll in the Pacific Ocean, where the data \n\nshowed a vortex-like drifting pattern. Subsequently, several other studies were conducted \n\nworldwide, providing a broader understanding and improving the scientific knowledge on this \n\nissue. \n\nCurrent wakes arise from the friction experienced by the flow field when the ocean currents \n\nintercept and get deflected by the island. This physical barrier forces the water to depart from a \n\nstraight path inducing an acceleration perpendicular to the original direction, known as the inertial \n\nforce (Tomczak, 1998). Another important force that must be taken into account is the frictional \n\nforce associated with the boundary layer around the island. The balance of these two forces plays \n\na crucial role determining the behaviour of the flow. If the frictional force dominates over the \n\ninertial force, the water transport gets dragged along the island\u2019s coasts, but if the dominant forces \n\nare reversed the water flow is therefore thrown off its path and gets separated from the island. This \n\nbalance is very closely related with the Reynolds number (Re), which takes into account the original \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nflow velocity, the width of the obstacle (in this case, an island) and the horizontal molecular \n\nviscosity.  \n\nIn an ideal case, Batchelor (1967) demonstrated that the Re is a good method for determining \n\nthe turbulence in a fluid. The author found that by increasing the flow velocity or the obstacle \n\ndiameter, the turbulence of the flow would equally increase, leading to the generation of a vortex \n\npair with opposite rotation attached to the obstacle, periodic oscillation of the wake, eddy shedding \n\nand eventually to a Von Karman Vortex Street. Nonetheless, it is a proven fact that the ocean is far \n\nfrom being an ideal case, given that: it is rare to find a perfectly cylindrical and isolated island in \n\ndeep ocean; the upstream flow velocity and direction is not constant, as it is under the influence of \n\na variety of factors; and the molecular viscosity in the equation must be replaced by the eddy \n\nviscosity in the ocean, which is poorly understood (Barton, 2001). The application of such theory \n\nin a complex system \u2013 particularly Cape Verde Archipelago, which is dispersed in a non-linear \n\norientation and under a non-laminar incident flow \u2013 is not a straightforward process. Thus, it is not \n\nconsidered in the current study. \n\nAs from the atmospheric point of view, it is well known that the atmosphere-ocean interaction \n\nis responsible for a high transfer of energy. Surface wind stress is the principal factor forcing basin-\n\nscale ocean circulation (Stewart, 2008; Talley et al., 2011) and is responsible for inducing local \n\ncurrents and turbulent features (Elken, 2016). Albeit the significant lower density in relation to the \n\nocean, the atmosphere is subjected to the same kind of fluid dynamics when intercepting an \n\nobstacle. Hence, oceanic islands topography can \u2013 as for oceanic flow \u2013 disturb the atmospheric \n\nflow, ultimately generating one of the most remarkable and distinct island-induced features in the \n\nadjacent environment. The atmospheric effect occurs when the incident wind flow gets blocked by \n\nan island high topography and creates extended sheltered regions in the lee zone downwind with \n\nan occasional vortex-like trail of clouds (Figure 1.1), previous referred as a Von Karman Vortex \n\nStreet (e.g., Chopra and Hubert, 1964; Caldeira et al., 2002; Couvelard et al., 2014; Spedding, \n\n2014).  \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 \u2013 Atmospheric shedding effects induced by the Cape Verde Archipelago: Von Karman Street in the lee of Santo Ant\u00e3o, \n\nS\u00e3o Nicolau and Fogo Islands, and wind wakes in the lee of Sal, Boavista, Maio and Santiago Islands. Source: Nasa. Georeferenced \n\nin ArcGIS. \n\nThis wind wake normally extends a few thousand kilometres from the island in the prevailing \n\nwind direction. The local response may be superficial, with the development of a diurnal \n\nthermocline in the sheltered region (e.g., Barton et al., 2000; Basterretxea et al., 2002; Caldeira, \n\n2002; Caldeira et al., 2005). In the case of persistent steady winds, however, the implications are \n\nmore significant. Sharp horizontal wind shear lines may form on the edges of the island wake, \n\nresulting in rapid variations of the Ekman transport in the ocean (Barton, 2001; Robinson, 2010). \n\nAt the western boundary of the lee, the upwelling of deeper waters must compensate the divergence \n\n- elevating the pycnocline closer to the surface - while at the eastern boundary, sinking of surface \n\nwater through Ekman pumping must occur as a product of the convergence \u2013 deepening the \n\npycnocline (Figure 1.2). Some authors argue that these processes are enhanced when the steady \n\nwind is capped by an atmospheric inversion layer (e.g., Barton et al., 2000; Hafner and Xie, 2003). \n\nAccording to Chavanne et al., (2002), this condition is well meet in the Cape Verde Islands, where \n\nit is possible to find strong and steady winds (~8 m.s-1) generated by the Azores High \u2013 Saharan \n\nLow system, with the addition of high altitude topography (1500-2800 m) which in turn is well \n\nabove the inversion layer (500-700 m). \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 \u2013 Representation of the eddy generation mechanism induced by wind shear. Red area represents warm stratified surface \n\nwater in the lee of the island; white line corresponds to the pycnocline; big white arrows represent the wind; curved arrows represent \n\nthe eddy cyclonic and anticyclonic movement which lead to upwelling and downwelling (vertical blue arrows), respectively. \n\nRetrived from Chavanne et al. (2001). \n\nFor islands with high mountains where the prevailing wind is parallel to the dominant ocean \n\ncurrent, it is difficult to access the nature of the eddies that are generated downstream, i.e. from \n\ncurrent or wind induced processes (Barton, 2001). In Hawaii, Patzert (1969) concluded that the \n\nimpinging flow was too weak for eddy generation, thus attributing the main cause to the local wind \n\nblowing through the narrow passage between the islands of Maui and Hawaii. In Canary Islands, \n\nAr\u00edstegui et al. (1994) noticed the presence of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies downstream of \n\nGran Canaria. The authors suggested that these are more likely to be provoked by the island\u2019s \n\nimpact on the oceanic flow rather than by the influence of the wind, since eddies are recurrent even \n\nduring periods of low wind intensity. The latter was further confirmed by R\u00f3drigues et al. (1999) \n\nand more recently by Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2008), who presented strong theoretical evidences (model \n\nresults) that supports the previous hypothesis. Still, one must consider the possibility that wind and \n\ncurrent island-induced disturbances may act as coupled mechanisms and thus enhance the \n\nproduction of eddies in such systems, especially when the two are not capable of acting alone \n\n(Barton et al., 2000; Basterretxea et al., 2002). \n\nIn some extraordinary cases, the wind blocking effect can have a regional impact over the \n\nocean, as it is the case of Hawaii. Xie et al. (2001) detected a wind wake induced by the islands \n\nsheltering of the north-easterly steady trade winds, extending 3000 km westward in the lee zone of \n\nthe archipelago. The authors suggested that this feature is responsible for the existence of the \n\nHawaiian Lee Counter Current (HLCC) that flows eastward in the opposite direction of both the \n\ntrade winds and the westward Pacific North Equatorial Current (Sasaki et al., 2010), leaving a \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nwarm surface and subsurface water signature stretching 8000 km away from the Asian coast (Xie \n\net al., 2001). Following the same nature of Hawaii, Chavanne et al. (2002) introduced the \n\npossibility that similar (but weaker) features to the HLCC are likely to happen in Cape Verde, thus \n\njustifying additional studies in the region.   \n\n  \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\n2. Geographic Settings  \n\nTo better understand the nature of the ocean circulation and features, one must initially \n\nconstruct knowledge regarding the geographic details of the region \u2013 including the regional \n\nbathymetry/topography, the wind field and its seasonality, among several other relevant factors for \n\nthe study (Tomczak and Godfrey, 1994). As such, a brief literature review about the oceanic and \n\natmospheric characteristics for the region of Cape Verde is presented in this chapter. \n\n2.1. Cape Verde Archipelago \n\nThe Republic of Cape Verde is an island country composed by ten islands and thirteen islets  \n\narrayed in a west-facing horseshoe disposition, being all of them from volcanic origin (Ramalho, \n\n2011). Along with the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands, the Cape Verde Archipelago is the \n\nsouthernmost group of islands which form the Macaronesia (EC, 2017). It is located in the North \n\nAtlantic and lies 450 \u2013 600 km off the western coast of Africa, in a geographical area between the \n\nlatitudes and longitudes of 14\u00ba40\u2019 \u2013 17\u00ba30\u2019N and 21\u00ba30\u2019 \u2013 25\u00ba30\u2019W, respectively. It occupies a \n\ntotal area of 4033 km2 unevenly distributed among the islands, with a significant total coast line of \n\napproximately 1020 km2 (DGA, 2004).  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 \u2013 (a) Topography and bathymetry of the Cabo Verde islands, with the identification and grouping of the islands. Isolines \n\nhave a 500-m interval. (b) Regional setting of the archipelago, with the identification of the main coastal features. Isolines have a \n\n1000-m interval. Datasource: SRTM 30 m. Created in GMT, edited in Inkscape. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nThe islands are divided into two main groups (Figure 2.1): The Windward group, comprising \n\nthe islands of Santo Ant\u00e3o, S\u00e3o Vicente, Santa Luzia, S\u00e3o Nicolau, Sal, and Boa Vista; and the \n\nLeeward group, comprising Maio, Santiago, Fogo, and Brava. However, in terms of \n\ngeomorphology and accordingly to the regional bathymetry, the archipelago can be divided in two \n\ndistinct groups: the northern chain, with a west-east orientation from Santo Ant\u00e3o to S\u00e3o Nicolau, \n\nprobably constitutes a single elongated edifice; and an east-to-southern chain, starting in Sal and \n\nending in Brava. Despite this division it is possible to consider Brava and Santiago as a detached \n\nedifice, since they are separated by a considerable depth of 3000 m. Between Boa Vista and Maio \n\nislands the bathymetry reveals a shallow area, known as Jo\u00e3o Valente bank with the highest summit \n\nhaving 14 m depth (Ramalho, 2011). The regional bathymetry also indicates the presence of several \n\nseamounts near the islands.  \n\nThe origins of the archipelago are attributed to the long-term mid-plate volcanism associated \n\nwith the Cape Verde hotspot which rests upon the Cape Verde Rise. The volcanic activity was not \n\ncontinuous \u2013 meaning that there were different periods of activity \u2013, leading to different formation \n\nages. By the surface geomorphology one may conclude that the eastern group of islands (Sal, Boa \n\nVista and Maio), which are characterized by long beaches and flat topography \u2013 evidences of \n\nerosion \u2013 were formed first. The other mountainous islands with higher peaks (Figure 2.2, Annex \n\nA.1) and sharper coastline are more recent. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 \u2013 Schematic representation of the highest altitude of every island in the Cape Verde Archipelago. Adapted from Saraiva \n\n(1961). \n\nN\no\nrt\n\nh\n F\n\na\nc\ne\n \n\nS\no\nu\nth\n\n F\na\nc\ne\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\n2.2. Climate \n\nThe islands are characterized by a tropical oceanic climate, with a small annual temperature \n\namplitude in the range from 19 to 29 \u00baC (Ramalho, 2011). Due to its location in the Sahelian arid \n\nbelt, the islands are exposed to very low precipitation levels \u2013 varying from ? 300 mm.yr-1 in low \n\naltitudes to ? 700 mm.yr-1 in higher altitudes (DGA, 2004) \u2013, and a seasonal rainfall regime \n\ncharacterized by dry (November - June) and wet (July - October) seasons (DGA, 2004; Varela-\n\nLopes and Molion, 2014). The archipelago\u2019s climate is under the direct influence of the \n\nIntertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and subjected to prevailing northeast trade winds occurring \n\nthroughout the year (Figure 2.3), with a higher intensity in winter and spring (9 m.s-1 maximum \n\nmean speed; NCAS, 2017) (Fernandes et al., 2005; L\u00e1zaro et al., 2005; Varela-Lopes and Molion, \n\n2014; Faye et al., 2015). These are responsible for the intensity and direction of local wave and \n\nsurface currents \u2013 which have asymmetrical characteristics between coastlines facing north and \n\nsouth (Ramalho, 2011) \u2013, as well as for the sea level height (Gomes et al., 2015). Higher wind \n\nspeeds are more frequent in the Leeward Islands than in the Windward Islands (DGA, 2004).  \n\n  \nFigure 2.3 \u2013 Representation of the seasonal mean wind speed and direction in the region of Cape Verde, between the years of 2003 \n\nto 2014. The presence of the ITCZ can be easily identified as a wind confluence zonal region at lower latitudes. Data: QuikSCAT \n\nand ASCAT.  \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\nThe ITCZ lies in the equatorial band and can be identified as a tropical belt of minimum wind \n\nspeeds (Molinari et al., 1986), where deep convective clouds (Waliser and Gautier, 1993) lead to \n\na maximum regional mean precipitation (Philander et al., 1996), and conversely to a regional solar \n\nradiation minimum (Tomczak and Godfrey, 1994). The latter results from the convergence of the \n\nsouthward and the northward warm and moist lower branches of the Hadley cell (from the northern \n\nand southern hemisphere, respectively) \u2013 known as the trade winds (Schneider et al., 2014). In the \n\nregional context, the ITZC follows the sun\u2019s zenith point (Soares, 2015) and migrates between 9\u00baN \n\nin summer and 2\u00baN in winter (Schneider et al., 2014), also in response to the northward shift and \n\nweakening of the Azores High\u2013Saharan Low system (Barton et al., 1998), thus governing the large-\n\nscale surface currents (Stramma and Schott, 1999). \n\n2.3. Oceanographic setting  \n\nThe Cape Verde sea is a deep oceanic region, where the density stratification of the water \n\ncolumn determines the hydrodynamics of the region (Gomes et al., 2015). This area is located at \n\nthe eastern boundary of the North Atlantic subtropical gyre at the southern limit of the Canary \n\nCurrent (CC) (Fernandes et al., 2005). It can be regarded as a region of large-scale interactions \n\n(Figure 2.4) between the CC, the North Equatorial Current (NEC), the North Equatorial Counter-\n\nCurrent (NECC) and the seasonal Mauritanian Current (MC) (Mittelstaedt, 1991). Also in its \n\nvicinity, two different water masses meet between Cape Blanc and the northernmost Cape Verde \n\nIslands, forming a large-scale frontal system coined by Zenk et al. (1991) as the Cape Verde Frontal \n\nZone (CVFZ), which extends zonally across the entire length of the Atlantic Ocean from the \n\nCaribbean Sea do the African coast (Emery and Meincke, 1986; Lozier et al., 1995). It is marked \n\nby substantial thermohaline (Zhang et al., 2003) and even larger inorganic and dissolved oxygen \n\ngradients (Pelegr\u00ed and Pe\u00f1a-Izquierdo, 2015), separating the warmer and saltier North Atlantic \n\nCentral Water (NACW) from the cooler, fresher and richer in nutrients South Atlantic Central \n\nWater (SACW) (e.g., Mittelstaedt 1983, 1991; P\u00e9res-Rodriguez et al., 2001; Meunier et al., 2012). \n\nAlbeit strong temperature and salinity gradients (? 3 \u00baC per 40 km and 0.9 psu per 10 km, \n\nrespectively), the front is density-compensated (Zenk et al., 1991; Pastor et al., 2008). Thus, it \n\ncannot be seen in the density field (Tomczak, 1998). Within this transition zone, an important eddy-\n\nfield exists (Barton, 1987; Meunier et al., 2012). The latter is more likely to arise from the kinetic \n\nenergy associated with the currents interaction and topography effects at Cape Blanc, or by the \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\noffshore advection developed along the upwelling front (Pastor et al., 2008) \u2013 since density-\n\ncompensated fronts are characterised by strong layering and intrusion, and only density fronts are \n\nassociated with strong geostrophic jets and eddy formation (Tomczak, 1998). As such, this feature \n\nalso acts as a source of offshore transport and lateral mixing, producing subsurface intrusions along \n\nthe front (Zenk et al., 1991; Mart\u00ednez-Marrero et al., 2008). Finally, its existence is \u2013 as for the \n\ninteraction of the large-scale current system (L\u00e1zaro et al., 2005) \u2013 potentially favourable for the \n\naggregation of large pelagic highly migratory fish species, being thus of great socio-economic \n\nimportance (Fernandes et al., 2000). Given the complexity of the regional surface circulation, a \n\ndetailed description of the main current systems follows.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4 \u2013 Representation of the mean surface ocean currents and features: CC - Canary Current; NEC - North Equatorial Current; \n\nNECC - North Equatorial Counter-Current; MC - Mauritania Current; GD - Guinea Dome; CVFZ \u2013 Cape Verde Frontal Zone. Note \n\nthe different colormaps. Data: GlobCurrent Geostrophic + Ekman. \n\nCanary Current (CC) \u2013 In its southern limit, this current transports cold water from north to \n\nsouth off the African coast, being stronger in summer near the African coast while in winter it is \n\nstronger west of the Canary Islands (Stramma and Siedler, 1988). At latitudes near Cape Blanc (20\u00ba \n\n\u2013 25\u00baN in spring and autumn, respectively) it turns south-westward, leaving the African coast to \n\nbecome the NEC (Mittelstaedt, 1983, 1991; Stramma et al., 2005). The location of such departure \n\nfrom the coast is extremely relevant for the position of the CVFZ (Stramma and Siedler, 1988). \n\nSince it does not have a direct impact on the archipelago, this current is only pertinent because of \n\nthe latter statements. \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\nNorth Equatorial Current (NEC) \u2013 The southern part of the Atlantic tropical gyre \u2013 where \n\nsubduction takes place (e.g., Schott et al., 2004; Stramma et al., 2005) \u2013 is characterised by a 10-\n\n15 cm.s-1 mean speed with a dominant west/north-westward direction (Richardson and Walsh, \n\n1986; Stramma and Siedler, 1988; Zhang et al., 2003), although some authors argue that it has a \n\npredominant south-westward direction visible throughout the year (L\u00e1zaro et al., 2005). As past \n\nstudies demonstrated (Arnault, 1987; Zhang et al., 2003; Lumpkin and Garzoli, 2005; Lumpkin \n\nand Pazos, 2007), this difference in current direction is entirely related with the nature of the \n\nmethod determining it, i.e. from purely geostrophic derivation (the latter) to the incorporation of \n\nthe Ekman transport (the former). According to the Ekman theory, the wind-driven component of \n\ntransport in the surface boundary layer is directed perpendicularly to the right (left) of the mean \n\nwind stress in the northern (southern) hemisphere (Ekman, 1905). Thus, it is reasonable to assume \n\nthat wind-driven Ekman transport has a significant impact in the region, as it is further \n\ndemonstrated by the representation of the Ekman volume transport (Figure 2.5).  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5 \u2013 Wind (black arrows) velocity and estimated Ekman volume transport per meter width (red arrows) represented over \n\nwind stress. Data: QuikSCAT and ASCAT.  \n\nWhen NEC reaches the archipelago\u2019s latitude it is divided in two branches (Figure 2.6), one \n\nturning south-westwards north of Cabo Verde islands and the other becoming a southwest flow \n\nsouth of the islands, both appearing to join at lower latitudes (L\u00e1zaro et al., 2005). This is more \n\nevident during the first half of the year whereas in the other half the flow migrates northwards, \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nfollowing the identical displacement of the NECC - both forced by the ITCZ northward migration \n\n(Stramma and Schott, 1999). The current intensity follows an identical seasonal pattern, weakening \n\nand reaching its maximum speed in summer and in spring and fall, respectively (Arnault, 1987). \n\nNorth Equatorial Counter-Current (NECC) \u2013 With an eastward mean and maximum flow \n\nspeed of approximately 42 cm.s-1 and 147 cm.s-1, respectively (Frantantoni, 2001), this current is \n\nparticularly strong in summer and early fall (Arnault, 1987; Mittelstaedt, 1991) \u2013 when the ITCZ \n\nreaches its northernmost position (L\u00e1zaro et al. 2005; Sch\u00fctte et al., 2016a). It is during this period \n\nthat the current is most likely to have an influence in the southern side of the Cape Verde \n\nArchipelago (Fernandes et al., 2005). In the western part, however, the current does not follow a \n\ncontinuous advective pathway, as some parcels are carried to the southern edge of NEC through \n\nEkman drift (Zhang et al., 2003; Lumpkin and Garzoli, 2005). During winter and spring the strong \n\ntrade winds are responsible for the weakening of this current, being forced to migrate to the equator \n\n(Mittelstaedt, 1991). Regions of high Eddy Kinetic Energy (EKE) are clearly associated with this \n\ncurrent (L\u00e1zaro et el., 2005).  \n\nMauritania Current (MC) \u2013 It is a result from the interception of NECC with the African \n\ncoast. Part of its flow is derived northward, carrying warm oligotrophic equatorial water to the \n\ntropical eastern Atlantic (Mittelstaedt, 1991). Thus, the strength of this current is strongly related \n\nto the seasonal varying NECC, with about 1-month time lag (L\u00e1zaro et al., 2005). MC only reaches \n\nthe latitude of approximately 14\u00baN during winter and early spring, but due to the relaxation of the \n\ntrade winds and the consequent northward displacement and strengthening of NECC, it reaches \n\nlatitudes of approximately 20\u00baN during summer and early autumn (Figure 2.6) and it is partly \n\nresponsible for the suppression of the regional costal upwelling (Mittelstaedt, 1991). Sch\u00fctte et al. \n\n(2016a) suggested that this current is strongly associated with the formation of eddies that \n\npropagate westward in the direction of Cape Verde.  \n\nThe Guinea Dome (GD) \u2013 Located southwest of the archipelago, this geostrophic cyclonic \n\nfeature is defined by a (cold) dome of the isotherms, and low hydrostatic pressure (Faye et al., \n\n2015), developed due to the Ekman suction (upwelling) driven by the local wind stress curl \n\n(Richardson and Walsh, 1986; Siedler et al., 1992; Yamagata and Iizuka, 1995). It exists \n\npermanently during the year and it is a constituent of the large-scale near-surface flow fields \n\nassociated with the NEC, the NECC and the North Equatorial Undercurrent (Siedler et al., 1992). \n\nThe NECC is responsible for the variability of the position, shape, and intensity of the such feature \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\n(L\u00e1zaro et al., 2005). Thus, its signal is more evident between May and December, following a \n\nsimilar displacement as the NECC when it moves north-westward.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6 - Representation of the seasonal mean surface currents, from 2003 to 2014. Note the different colormaps. Data: \n\nGlobCurrent Geostrophic + Ekman. \n\nFollowing the main large-scale surface currents description, a conspicuous seasonal signal has \n\nbeen documented (Figure 2.6) as the dominant aspect in the region (Mittelstaedt et al., 1991; L\u00e1zaro \n\net al. 2005), being mainly induced by the variability of the trade winds (Stramma and Schott, 1999).   \n\nTrade winds and the ITCZ generate large scale divergent Ekman transports along the western \n\nAfrican coast (Faye et al., 2015), leading to one of the strongest and most productive upwelling \n\nsystems in the world (Ould-dedah et al., 1999). Costal upwelling is permanent between 20\u00ba \u2013 25\u00baN, \n\nreaching its maximum intensity during spring and autumn (Figure 2.7, Mittelstaedt, 1991; Ould-\n\ndedah, et al., 1999). South of 20\u00baN this phenomenon is conspicuous during winter and early spring \n\n(Van Camp et al., 1991; Nykj\u00e6r and Van Camp, 1994; L\u00e1zaro et al., 2005) and is associated with \n\na significant enhancement of biological productivity (Pelegr\u00ed et al., 2006; Lathuili\u00e8re et al., 2008, \n\nDemarcq and Somoue, 2015), which is also partially driven by the southward transport of cold, \n\nnutrient-rich water from the CC (Mittelstaedt, 1991). The strength and seasonal oscillation of the \n\ncoastal upwelling depends mainly on the alongshore wind-stress and wind-stress curl seasonal \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\npatterns (Hagen, 2001; Pradhan et al., 2006), and in the seasonal variation of the MC extension \n\n(Mittelstaedt, 1991; Siedler et al., 1992; L\u00e1zaro et al., 2005). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.7 - Sea Surface Temperature seasonal means from 2003 to 2014. It is worth noting the apparent warm wake in the lee of \n\nSanto Ant\u00e3o and Fogo Islands.  \n\nThis region experiences on of the largest Sea Surface Temperature (SST) cycles in the tropics \n\n(Faye et al., 2015). The SST variation has a considerable lower amplitude in offshore waters than \n\nin coastal waters (Figure 2.8), a fact that is conspicuously related to the coastal upwelling seasonal \n\ncycle (e.g., Mittelstaedt, 1991; Van Camp et al., 1991; Ould-dedah et al., 1999; Marcello et al., \n\n2011). In the area of Cape Verde Islands, maximum values (29 \u00baC) are achieved from July to \n\nNovember (Figure 2.7) \u2013 coincidently with higher pigment concentrations near Cape Verde \n\n(Fernandes et al., 2005) \u2013, whilst minimum values (21 \u2013 22\u00baC) are conversely seen between \n\nDecember and May (DGA, 2004).  \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.8 \u2013 Sea Surface Temperature standard deviation showing the effect of the seasonal variability associated with upwelling \n\noff the western African coast.  \n\nActing as a source of organic matter, inorganic nutrients and phytoplankton in the region, it has \n\nbeen consistently reported the generation of giant filaments off Cape Blanc (e.g., Gabric et al., \n\n1993; Kostianoy and Zatsepin, 1996; Lange et al., 1998; Pastor et al., 2008; Meunier et al., 2012; \n\nPelegr\u00ed and Pe\u00f1a?Izquierdo, 2015). The filament can have a significant impact on the archipelago\u2019s \n\nbiological productivity (Fernandes et al., 2005), acting as remote enrichment. This feature results \n\nfrom the intersection of the Mauritanian coastal upwelling system and the very complex and \n\ndynamic CVFZ, as intrinsically unstable upwelling currents interact with the Cape Verde front \n\neddy field (Meunier et al., 2012). This phenomenon seems to be responsible for the transport of \n\ncold nutrient-rich water offshore and plays a crucial part in the generation of the Cap Blanc \n\nfilaments (Meunier et al., 2012), which have reportedly increased their offshore spreading during \n\nthe last years (Marcello et al., 2011). Lastly, it is important to note that the atmospheric deposition \n\nof Saharan dust is an important source of essential and limiting nutrients (Gelado?Caballero, 2015) \n\n\u2013 such as silicon, phosphorus, nitrogen, and iron. However, only 5% of the Chla variability in the \n\nregion was related to the dust input (Ohde and Siegel, 2010).  \n\n  \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\n3. Data Acquisition and Processing  \n\nTaking into account the inherent complexity and variability associated to eddies and other \n\npertinent mesoscale processes, the coupling of several satellite-based remote-sensing products is \n\nconsidered to be the most efficient approach for the study of the Cape Verde Archipelago. It is \n\nimportant to note that, given the exploratory nature of such investigation, the planning and structure \n\nof the current project is directly dependent on the preliminary results. Therefore, a behaviour-\n\noriented approach is executed, first by performing an initial characterisation of the regional setting. \n\nThis preliminary investigation is defined at 10 \u2013 50\u00baW and 4 \u2013 24\u00baN, extending almost the entire \n\nzonal length of the Atlantic Ocean, from the western African coast to the eastern South American \n\ncoast. It is important to note, however, that part of this characterisation was already described in \n\nthe previous chapter. Then, the representation and analysis of sequential 8-day averages was \n\nperformed, considering the recurrent period of most satellites and datasets being used (~4 days). \n\nSubsequently, simple statistical procedures were applied, along with the computation of 12-year \n\nand seasonal means. The seasonal grouping refers to the northern hemisphere (i.e., boreal seasons), \n\nsuch that: winter goes from January to March; spring goes from April to June, summer goes from \n\nJuly to September; and Autumn goes from October to December.  \n\nOnce the preliminary analysis was concluded, special attention was regarded towards the eddy \n\nfield around and within the archipelago. Hence, two groups of eddies were defined: the far-field \n\neddies \u2013 those that were created outside the Cape Verde Area (hereinafter referred as CV area) but \n\nat some point intersected the delimited CV area; and the near-field eddies \u2013 those created inside \n\nCV area, whether by island-induced mechanisms or by far-field eddy-island interaction. The \n\nstatistics of these two groups of eddies were further described, along with the representations of \n\ntheir geographical distribution and associated kinematic properties. Then, a more detailed analysis \n\nof the far and near-field eddy dynamics was conducted. Lastly, the final focus of the study was \n\ndirected to the biological implications of the such physical processes. \n\nThe study period was set from 2003 to 2014 based the data availability of the selected variables \n\n(Table 3.1). Furthermore, MatLab was used for most the data download, subsampling and \n\nprocessing. The \u201ccmocean\u201d tool for MatLab was used for some plots, enabling a more realistic and \n\neffective representation of the data (Thyng et al., 2016). When necessary, plots were edited in \n\nInkscape.  \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nTable 3.1 \u2013 Data availability from 1993 to 2016. Green and empty cells represent available and non-available data, respectively. \n\nStudy period is delimited by black thick lines and represented in dark-green.  \n\n \n \n\n3.1. Wind \n\nThe importance of the wind as a driver for oceanic surface currents has long been well \n\nestablished (Pond and Pickard, 1983; Tomczak and Godfrey, 1994; Talley et al., 2011). Given the \n\nnature of the mechanism in study and all that was mentioned before, wind data is undoubtedly an \n\nessential tool for the regional oceanographic characterisation at a large scale and for the \n\ninvestigation of the archipelago\u2019s impact in the wind dynamics at a local scale. \n\nAs such, wind speed and direction was provided by the QuikSCAT scatterometer-derived \n\ndataset (SeaPAC, 2016), considered to be an accurate representation of oceanic winds (Couvelard \n\net al., 2012). It was produced by NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory and distributed by the NASA \n\nPhysical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC). This instrument was part \n\nof a \u201cquick recovery\u201d mission (hence the naming of the project) designed to fill the gap created by \n\nthe premature loss of the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) aboard the ADEOS-1 satellite in June \n\n1997 (Lungu, 2001). The scatterometer measured the wind roughened ocean surface \u2013 which is \n\nhighly correlated with the near-surface wind field (Hoffman and Leidner, 2005) \u2013 through \n\nmicrowave pulses emitted by the rotating dish antenna at Ku-band (13.4 GHz) (Spencer et al., \n\n2000). The power of the \u201cbackscattered\u201d signal is then used for inferring the wind speed and \n\ndirection. The usage of a microwave radar (an active sensor) implies that data can be retrieved \n\nunder all weather and cloud conditions (Moroni et al., 2013). However, there are some limitations, \n\nsuch as rain contaminations and high wind speed measurements. The satellite has a recurrent period \n\n1\n9\n9\n3\n\n1\n9\n9\n4\n\n1\n9\n9\n5\n\n1\n9\n9\n6\n\n1\n9\n9\n7\n\n1\n9\n9\n8\n\n1\n9\n9\n9\n\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n0\n1\n\n2\n0\n0\n2\n\n2\n0\n0\n3\n\n2\n0\n0\n4\n\n2\n0\n0\n5\n\n2\n0\n0\n6\n\n2\n0\n0\n7\n\n2\n0\n0\n8\n\n2\n0\n0\n9\n\n2\n0\n1\n0\n\n2\n0\n1\n1\n\n2\n0\n1\n2\n\n2\n0\n1\n3\n\n2\n0\n1\n4\n\n2\n0\n1\n5\n\n2\n0\n1\n6\n\nQuikScat\n\nASCAT\n\nOSCAR\n\nGlobCurrent \n\nOpenEddy\n\nChelton and Schlax\n\nADT AVISO \n\nChla Aqua MODIS\n\nSST GHRSST\n\nDataset\n\nYear\n\nWind\n\nCurrents\n\nEddies\n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\nof approximately ~4 days (57 orbits) and the capacity for collecting an 1800 km-wide band. The \n\ncombination of the orbital period (14.25 orbits/day) and inclination (98.62\u00ba) resulted in a \n\nremarkable 90% daily coverage of the global ice-free ocean (Moroni et al., 2013).  \n\nDespite the original spatial resolution of the sensor, higher resolution is achieved through a \n\nslice composite technique from level 1 data (PO.DAAC, 2017). Thus, QuikScat data is available \n\nat 12.5 km and 25 km spatial resolution, yet with distinct levels of processing. The sparser \n\nresolution (25 km) is distributed at processing level 3, which means that the data is available at a \n\ndaily or time averaged spatially fixed and uniform grid. However, the higher-resolution data (12.5 \n\nkm) is only available at level 2, meaning that the data is mapped over an along-track/cross-track \n\nnon-uniform swath grid (i.e. organized by swath rows perpendicular to satellite path), and each file \n\ncontains data of a single satellite orbit. Despite the advantage of a high processing level, one must \n\nconsider that the Cape Verde Islands are relatively small and higher pixel size (wind vector cell) \n\nresults in a lower resolution. The algorithm behind the 12.5 km resolution data processing was \n\nsubjected to significant improvements recently, tackling issues such as rain contaminations, \n\nsampling limitations and ambiguous direction retrievals (Fore et al., 2014). Moreover, by \n\nincorporating an enhanced coastal processing method, the near-shore wind variations is now more \n\naccurate than ever before (PO.DAAC, 2017). That being said, the reprocessed QuikSCAT Level \n\n2B Version 3.1 product is considered to be the best suited dataset for the current study. The data \n\nsubsampling and download was made through the \u201cHigh-level Tool for Interactive Data \n\nExtraction\u201d website (https://podaac-tools.jpl.nasa.gov/hitide/). After download, the data was \n\nprojected into a spatially uniform 12.5 km (~0.1\u00ba) resolution grid and averaged over 8 days, so that \n\nthe gaps created by the satellite tracks could be minimised. This way, every place in the study area \n\nwas covered at least two times. Albeit it exceeded its operational time expectancy, QuikSCAT data \n\nis only available until November 2009. Taking into consideration that most variables availability \n\nare overlapped from 2003 to 2014 (Table 3.1), a different dataset should be incorporated. \n\nThe Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) is a real aperture radar based instrument aboard the \n\nMetOp-A and MetOp-B polar satellites, which became fully operational in May 2007 and \n\nSeptember 2011, respectively, and remain active to date. The satellites were launched by the \n\nEuropean Space Agency (ESA) and are operated by the \u201cEuropean Organisation for the \n\nExploitation of Meteorological Satellites\u201d (EUMETSAT, 2015). It uses a similar system as the \n\nQuikSCAT instrument, in the sense that it measures near-surface wind properties (at 10-m above \n\nhttps://podaac-tools.jpl.nasa.gov/hitide/\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nthe sea surface) by inferring the sea surface roughness by microwave radar. Nonetheless, this sensor \n\ndiffers from the QuikSCAT in technical specifications and configuration. It is composed by two \n\nsets of three fixed antennas with 45\u00ba inclination, which pulsate radar beams at a frequency of 5.26 \n\nGHz (C-band) \u2013 more robust in terms of rain contamination \u2013 on both sides of the satellite ground \n\ntrack, covering two 550 km-wide swaths separated by ~700 km (OSI SAF, 2016). The version 2.1 \n\nof the ASCAT (MetOp-A) wind product is provided by the Remote Sensing System organisation \n\n(RSS, 2017), which underwent a reprocessing procedure by applying a new the Geophysical Model \n\nFunction (GMF), based on the Ku-band GMF (QuikSCAT) methodology. As such, ASCAT is now \n\nin better agreement with the QuikSCAT dataset (Ricciardulli, 2016), being thus the best option to \n\nfulfil the purpose of the current study. The swath files at 12.5 km spatial resolution (Ricciardulli \n\nand Wentz, 2016) were downloaded from the company\u2019s FTP server and processed with MatLab \n\nroutines, made available by RSS (2017). After this, and following the same methodology as for the \n\nQuikSCAT, the data was gridded and time averaged, so that the two datasets could be merged. \n\n\u2022 Data Processing \n\nThe wind itself can only have an influence in the ocean as a frictional force, which arises from \n\nthe relative motion between the atmosphere and the ocean (Stewart, 2008). As such, the transfer of \n\nmomentum is due to the input of energy (N.m-2) by the wind in the form of wind stress. However, \n\nwind retrievals from scatterometer instruments are calibrated against the equivalent 10-m neutral \n\nwind rather than wind stress, because the latter is difficult to measure directly (Chavanne et al., \n\n2002). Thus, the wind stress (?????) is calculated based on Gill (1982):  \n\n ????? =  ???? ?? ?\n2 (1) \n\nwhere ????  is the density of the air (1.2 kg.m\n-3), ?? is the non-linear wind-drag coefficient \u2013 based \n\non Large and Pond (1981), modified for low wind speeds (Trenberth et al., 1990) \u2013, and ? is the \n\nwind speed at 10 m above sea surface, which in turn is calculated by the metric: \n\n ? = ??2 + ?2  (2) \n\nwhere ? and ? are the zonal and meridional wind components (m.s-1), respectively. Another \n\nvaluable parameter is the wind stress curl (? \u00d7 ????? ). It is calculated by the Equation 3:  \n\n \n? \u00d7 ????? =  \n\n???\n??\n\n?\n???\n??\n\n (3) \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\nwhere ?? and ?? are the zonal and meridional wind stress components, respectively. This parameter \n\nis directly proportional to the vertical water displacement in ocean\u2019s interior. Thus, for the northern \n\nhemisphere, upwelling results from positive (divergent/cyclonic) wind stress curl and downwelling \n\nresults from negative (convergent/anticyclonic) wind stress curl (Talley et al., 2011). Furthermore, \n\nupwelling is referred to Ekman suction, while downwelling is referred to as Ekman pumping. \n\nLastly, the horizontal component of the wind-driven Ekman (volume) transport (??? ) is calculated \n\naccording to Smith (1968) and Bakun (1973): \n\n \n??? =  \n\n1\n\n??? ?\n????? (4) \n\nwhere ???  is the reference seawater density (1024 kg.m\n-3) and ? is the Coriolis parameter, in which:  \n\n ? = 2? sin ? (5) \n\nwhere ? is the earth rotation rate (7.2921 \u00d7 10?5 rad.s-1) and ? is the latitude (Stewart, 2011).  \n\n3.2. Ocean Surface Currents \n\nOcean surface currents are the horizontal movement of water at the oceans mixed layer, which \n\nis the upper boundary layer (or Ekman layer) and a zone of momentum exchange from the \n\natmosphere to the sea (Tomczak and Godfrey, 1964). The varying temporal and spatial scales, in \n\nconjunction with the countless number of factors which drive the motion of the ocean\u2019s surface, \n\nmakes the ocean currents to behave in a very complex manner. In-situ measurements are reliable \n\nbut limited in spatial coverage and regularity. Satellite remote sensing, however, is an ideal tool \n\nfor studying ocean surface dynamics at a large scale (Dohan and Maximenko, 2010), since it \n\nprovides global observations at a regular basis. In order to assess the nature and behaviour of the \n\noceanic currents at a regional and local scale, two similar datasets were considered.  \n\nOcean Surface Current Analyses Real-time (OSCAR) is a NASA funded research project \u2013 \n\noperated by Earth &amp; Space Research institute (ESR) \u2013 that provides surface current velocities \n\n(averaged over the top 30 m of the ocean) calculated from the combination of several satellite \n\nsensed datasets, these being Sea Level Anomaly (SLA)1, Winds2 and SST3 (Dohan and \n\n                                                 \n1 Altimetry data from the AVISO multi-mission product. \n2 Special Sensor Microwave Imagers, QuikSCAT and ASCAT (MetOp-A). \n3 Weekly Reynolds Smith O.I. v2.  \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\nMaximenko, 2010). On the top of providing a near real-time global coverage of the ocean surface \n\ncurrents, one of the project\u2019s main objective is to improve the knowledge of the mechanisms behind \n\nthe transfer of momentum between the atmosphere and the ocean (ESR, 2017a). To that end, the \n\nmodel calculations take into account the principles of geostrophy \u2013 calculating the pressure \n\ngradient from the SLA \u2013 and the wind driven velocity components \u2013 calculating Ekman-Stommel \n\nequations, as well as thermal wind induced currents (Hausman et al., 2009). With a 5-day temporal \n\nresolution, this product extends from 1992 to present day and is spatially distributed over a 1/3\u00ba \n\nresolution grid. Substantial calibration and validation of the modelled data is regularly performed \n\nby ESR using drifter and mooring data (ESR, 2017b). The correlation coefficient between model \n\nand drifter data (for the period of 2005 to 2009) is ~0.55 for the area of Cape Verde (Annex B.1). \n\nFurthermore, the visual comparison between OSCAR\u2019s and moored zonal and meridional \n\nvelocities near to the archipelago (Annex B.2) indicates a similar general pattern, though far from \n\nbeing identical.    \n\nGlobCurrent is another reliable product, based on the same processing principles of OSCAR. \n\nFunded by ESA Data User Element, this project relies on advanced processing tools and simulation \n\nmodels that used satellite4 and in-situ5 data for producing an optimized approximation of the global \n\nsurface ocean circulation (ESA, 2015). Covering the period from 1993 to 2016, several datasets \n\nare provided, such as individual Geostrophic, Ekman and Stokes Drift current components, as well \n\nas the combined Geostrophic and Ekman currents at the surface and 15 m depth. All the datasets \n\nare available at a daily interval and at 1/4\u00ba resolution. However, one must consider that the effective \n\ntemporal and spatial resolution for the combined Geostrophic and Ekman currents is of the order \n\nof 5-10 days and 50-100 km, respectively (ESA, 2015), which in turn is related with the sensor \n\nlimitations of the altimetry product being used. Despite this, it remains to be a valid option, since \n\nmesoscale eddies and strong ocean currents are found at spatial scales that vary between tens to \n\nseveral hundred kilometres and timescales of days to years (Talley et al., 2011).  \n\nQuantitative comparisons between the combined GlobCurrent, OSCAR and SVP-type drifter \n\ndata6 were performed for the period ranging from September 2012 to September 2013 at a global \n\n                                                 \n4 Altimetry, gravimetry, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), scatterometry and optical/passive microwaves. \n5 Drifting and moored buoys, coastal high-frequency radar, Argo floats, gliders and ship observations. \n6 This dataset is not part of the in-situ variables used for the calculation of GlobCurrent, so that the validation remains \n\nfully independent.  \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\nscale (Table 3.2). The 3-day low pass filter was applied to eliminate high-frequency ageostrophic \n\nsignals which cannot be reproduced in the modelled data (ESA, 2015). Despite the minor \n\ndifferences in correlation, GlobCurrent is in better agreement with SVP data.  \n\nTable 3.2 - Root Mean Square (RMS) and Correlation coefficients between in-situ SVP velocities and the two current products. \n\nAdapted from ESA, 2015. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTaking all things into consideration, the GlobCurrent combined currents proved to be the best \n\noption for this study for two main reasons: higher temporal and spatial resolution (even though it \n\nis achieved by interpolation); and higher scores in the correlation between in-situ data. The data \n\nsubset and download was performed in Matlab through GlobCurrent\u2019s OpenDAP server \n\n(http://www.ifremer.fr/opendap/cerdap1/globcurrent/). These files were already provided at \n\nprocessing level 4, which means that no further data mapping or compilation was required.  \n\n\u2022 Data Processing \n\nThe Eddy Kinetic Energy (EKE) for surface currents is a valuable measurement for the \n\nestimation of mesoscale variability, since it is directly linked to the input of kinetic energy \n\nexclusively induced by eddies (e.g., L\u00e1zaro et al., 2005; Calil et al., 2008; Chaigneau et al., 2008; \n\nLathuili\u00e8re et al., 2008; Yoshida et al., 2010; Jia et al., 2011; Caldeira et al., 2017). EKE was first \n\nderived from ship drift observations, but in current times it is easily constructed from surface drifter \n\nvelocities (Richardson, 1983; Frantantoni, 2001) and from surface velocities derived from altimetry \n\nproducts (Talley et al., 2011) \u2013 as it is the case for the current dataset. As such, this parameter was \n\ncomputed using the following Equation (6): \n\n \n??? =\n\n1\n\n2\n(?2 + ?2) (6) \n\nwhere ? and ? correspond to the zonal and meridional current velocity components, respectively.  \n\n RMS R2 \n\nR2 \nU V U V \n\nUnfiltered drifter velocities \n\nGlobCurrent  15.1 14.9 0.67 0.62 0.65 \n\nOSCAR 16.3 15.8 0.67 0.59 0.64 \n\n3-days filtered drifter velocities \n\nGlobCurrent 11.3 10.9 0.75 0.76 0.73 \n\nOSCAR 12.8 11.8 0.73 0.76 0.70 \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\n3.3. Eddies \n\nGiven the fact that mesoscale eddies have distinctive characteristics that can be used for this \n\npurpose \u2013 such as temperature anomalies (Caldeira et al., 2002;  Sangr\u00e0 et al., 2004; Caldeira et \n\nal., 2014), surface roughness signature (Fu and Holt, 1983; Yamaguchi and Kawamura, 2009; \n\nKarimova, 2009), enhanced levels of primary production (Ar\u00edstegui et al., 1997; Basterretxea et \n\nal., 2005; Gaube et al., 2013), sea surface elevation/depressions (Chelton et al., 2011; Sch\u00fctte et \n\nal., 2016a), among others (Munk et al., 2000; Calil et al., 2008; Jia et al., 2011) \u2013 one may arrive \n\nto the false assumption that autonomous methods for eddy detection and tracking are easily \n\nachieved. The fact is that only altimetry can provide a regular and reliable monitoring capability \n\nfor mesoscale eddies, since it performs well regardless of the cloud cover and oceanic conditions \n\n(Robinson., 2010). Still, altimetry-based tools are susceptible to errors, because it attempts to detect \n\nthe presence of three-dimensional features using sea surface information that is subjected to a \n\nvariety of processes other than eddies (Faghmous et al., 2015a). That being said, two very similar \n\naltimetry-based products were considered and are further discussed.  \n\nThe \u201cMesoscale Eddies in Altimeter Observations of SSH\u201d dataset (hereinafter CSS11) was \n\nproduced by Dudley Chelton and Michael Schlax at the Oregon State University (Chelton and \n\nSchlax, 2017). It relies on the usage of a SLA dataset (DT-2014 MSLA) provided by the Archiving \n\nValidation and Interpretation of Satellite Data in Oceanography (AVISO) to identify and determine \n\neddy parameters, such as its nature (cyclonic/anticyclonic), swirl speed, amplitude and radius \n\n(Chelton et al., 2011). It is based on the premise that an eddy must be a propagating, compact and \n\ncoherent structure in the space-time Sea Surface Height (SSH) fields (Schlax and Chelton, 2016). \n\nThe latest version of this product is based on Williams et al. (2011) method, which defines an \n\nanticyclonic (cyclonic) eddy by first finding the local SLA maximum (minimum) and then \n\nconnecting all the adjacent pixels that satisfy a set of five conditions7 (Chelton et al., 2011) and in \n\nwhich the corresponding SLA lies above a sequence of successively decreasing (increasing) \n\nthresholds (Schlax and Chelton, 2016). Despite its reliability, only eddies with a minimum \n\namplitude and lifetime of 1 cm and 4 weeks, respectively, are retained. This is a big disadvantage \n\nsince, according to Sch\u00fctte et al. (2016a), the average eddy lifetime in the study area varies between \n\n                                                 \n7 SLA values for each pixel must be above or below a given threshold; The delimited area of an eddy must be comprised \n\nbetween a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 1000 pixels; A local maximum/minimum must exist; The amplitude (SLA \n\ngradient) must be at least 1 cm; The distance between any pair of points cannot exceed a specified maximum.  \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\n24 and 32 days. The latter authors also suggest that some eddies may disappear from one timestep \n\nto another \u2013 due to the separation of satellite ground tracks \u2013 driving this kind of algorithms to \n\nfalsely identify lost eddies as new. Nonetheless, the most limiting factor of this dataset is the \n\noccasional large jumps in eddy locations associated to the changing of a 7-day to daily SSH \n\nsampling frequency (Chelton and Schlax, 2017). Such jumps make eddy trajectories to be \n\ninaccurate, making this product unreliable. \n\nKeeping that in mind, an alternative dataset should be considered. Faghmous et al. (2015a) \n\npresented and made publicly available the OpenEddy tool. It differentiates from most of the eddy \n\ndetection products in the sense that, besides providing a daily dataset containing eddy features and \n\ntrajectories, the authors also provide the eddy detection and tracking source code (in Python and \n\nMatLab) so that the procedure can be carried based on the user\u2019s research purpose. Similarly to \n\nCS11, Faghmous et al. (2015a) product relies on daily SLA maps from AVISO. Nevertheless, it \n\nstrives to be as threshold-free as possible, since the only obvious limitation is related to the \n\nminimum eddy size (4 pixels, which corresponds to ~30 km radius), which in turn is intrinsically \n\nrelated to the SLA product\u2019s resolution. Another (and possibly the biggest) advantage of this \n\nalgorithm is the ability to search and find prematurely terminated eddies. This is achieved by \n\nsearching for eddies with the same characteristics (size, amplitude, etc.) for a user-specified number \n\nof time-steps before terminating the track. Then, the search radius is attributed to the maximum \n\ntranslation distance of that eddy, by estimating its expected propagation speed (Faghmous et al., \n\n2015a). Nonetheless, it should be noted that the susceptibility to error in associating supposedly \n\nterminated eddies to interpolated tracks increases with the number of associated time-steps \n\n(Faghmous et al., 2015a).  \n\nThe biggest disadvantage of this tool is related with the eddy detection method. Considering \n\nthat the geostrophic flow around eddies follows the closed contours of SLA, this algorithm \n\nidentifies an eddy by determining the outermost closed contours of SLA containing a single \n\nmaximum or minimum extreme (Figure 3.1). This can contribute to an overestimation of the eddy\u2019s \n\nsize and may also lead to the cancelling of small features that are close to each other, making the \n\neddy identification less robust than CSS11 latest version. Despite this, the algorithm is still capable \n\nof recovering 96.4% of features identified by domain experts (Faghmous et al., 2015a).   \n\nAll things considered, the eddy tracking was performed using the OpenEddy MatLab scripts \n\n(https://github.com/jfaghm/OceanEddies) and an already processed dataset containing all \n\nhttps://github.com/jfaghm/OceanEddies\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nmesoscale eddy features that were at least 4 grid cells large (Faghmous et al., 2015b). The tracking \n\nprocedure was constrained to the following conditions: every eddy, regardless of the lifetime, was \n\nincluded in the analysis; the minimum area was set to the lowest possible (radius of ~30 km); no \n\nthreshold was set regarding the amplitude; and the tolerance number of timesteps in which a \n\nterminated eddy can be traced was set to 3 days \u2013 built on the assumption that an island-induced \n\neddy takes on average 3 days to fully rotate on itself (Sangr\u00e0 et al., 2005; 2007, Barton, 2001). \n\nLastly, the final dataset was transformed into a CS11-like format to simplify further analysis.  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 - The mesoscale eddies contours identified by the OpenEddy algorithm. Colors represent the number of experts that \n\nvalidated each feature. Retrieved from Faghmous et al. (2015a). \n\nFrom Figure 3.1 one may observe that most eddies detected by the algorithm do not necessarily \n\nhave a perfectly circular shape to be considered as such. Thus, the algorithm determines the eddy \n\nradius (?) as a function of the area (?) \u2013 i.e., the radius of a circle with area equal to that within \n\nthe closed contour of SSH \u2013 following Equation (2): \n\n \n\n? =  ?\n?\n\n?\n (7) \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\nThe eddy amplitude is also determined by the algorithm as the difference in height between the \n\nSLA extremes and is always given has an absolute value. The combination of the two previous \n\nparameters is then used for the determination of the geostrophic swirl speed. However, an issue \n\nwas detected regarding this parameter, which is further discussed in Chapter 5.2. Lastly, the \n\ntravelled distance (??) and translation speed (?) are two important parameters for the current study, \n\nbut were not included in the OpenEddy algorithms. Thus, a MatLab script was created for the \n\ncalculation of such parameters, using the coordinates of the detected eddies. The travelled distance \n\nis computed using the following Equation 8:   \n\n ?? =  \n?. ?\n\n180\n \u00d7 cos?1( sin ?? . sin ?? + cos ??. cos ?? . cos??)   (8) \n\nwhere ? is earth\u2019s radius (6378 km), ?? and ?? are the latitudes of point ? and point ?, respectively, \n\nand ?? is the longitudinal difference between both points (Movable Type Scripts, 2017). \n\nSubsequently, the eddy propagation speed (?) was estimated following Equation 9: \n\n \n? =  \n\n??\n??\n\n (9) \n\nwhere ?? is the time interval between point ? and point ?. \n\n3.4. Absolute Dynamic Topography \n\nThe usage of altimetry-based products is fundamental for this study. The principle behind \n\naltimetry-sensed measurements is very similar to the wind scatterometer. However, instead of \n\n\u201csweeping\u201d an area and relying only in the backscattered signal\u2019s power, the sensor measures the \n\nshape and more importantly the signal\u2019s travel time, estimating the distance of the satellite to the \n\npoint directly below it \u2013 known as Nadir (Robinson, 2010). Albeit the eddy detection and tracking \n\nalgorithms didn\u2019t require this dataset, it is still essential to include this parameter in order to access \n\nits variability in space and time, and to facilitate the study of individual eddies. For this reason, the \n\nAVISO Absolute Dynamic Topography (ADT) dataset (DT-MADT) was downloaded from the \n\nCopernicus Marine and Environment Monitoring Service8. It is part of the Ssalto/DUACS system, \n\nthat processes data from all altimeter missions (Saral, Cryosat-2, Jason-1&amp;2, T/P, Envisat, GFO, \n\n                                                 \n8 http://marine.copernicus.eu/services-portfolio/access-to-\n\nproducts/?option=com_csw&amp;view=details&amp;product_id=SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L4_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_008\n\n_046 \n\nhttp://marine.copernicus.eu/services-portfolio/access-to-products/?option=com_csw&amp;view=details&amp;product_id=SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L4_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_008_046\nhttp://marine.copernicus.eu/services-portfolio/access-to-products/?option=com_csw&amp;view=details&amp;product_id=SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L4_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_008_046\nhttp://marine.copernicus.eu/services-portfolio/access-to-products/?option=com_csw&amp;view=details&amp;product_id=SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L4_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_008_046\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nERS-1 &amp; 2 and Geosat) in an attempt to provide a consistent and homogeneous dataset for various \n\nuses (AVISO, 2015). Furthermore, the combination of several altimetry datasets into one single \n\nproduct considerably improves the capacity for detecting mesoscale features such as fronts, eddies \n\nand even filaments (Pascual et al., 2006) \n\nThe ADT is the sum of the SLA and the Mean Dynamic Topography (MDT) (Figure 3.2; Mertz \n\net al., 2017), or in other words, ADT corresponds to the SSH, but with respect to the geoid (GOCE \n\nDIR-R4), because the SSH is referenced to the ellipsoid. The ADT is a relevant parameter for the \n\ncomputation of seasonal and annual means. For the identification of single features, however, the \n\nSLA is the most adequate parameter to use, since it represents the absolute signal variation from \n\nthe time-averaged signal. There are two ways of computing the SLA: one is with respect to the \n\nellipsoid, which corresponds to the SSH deviation from the Mean Sea Surface (MSS); another is \n\nwith respect to the geoid, which corresponds to the ADT deviation from the MDT. Regardless of \n\nthe method, the anomaly signal remains the same as long as the correct mean is used as a reference. \n\nThus, the SLA was computed using the 12-year MDT previously calculated from the ADT field.  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 - Altimetry principles.

Chlorophyll a \n\nIn the interest of determining the biological impact of the physical mechanisms being studied, \n\nas well as the remote-enrichment that may reach the Cape Verde Islands from the African coast \n\n(Fernandes et al., 2005; Lathuili\u00e8re et al., 2008), monthly and 8-day averaged surface Chla satellite \n\nobservations were retrieved from the \u201cOceanColor\u201d server \n\n(https://oceandata.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODIS-Aqua/Mapped/) with a 4.63-km spatial resolution. \n\nChla is the most important pigment in the respiration process of photosynthetic organisms, such as \n\nphytoplankton (Talley et al., 2011). It absorbs mostly blue wave light (440 nm) and reflects the \n\ngreen. This is called the blue/green ratio and can be used as a proxy for determining primary \n\nproduction (Robinson, 2010; Gove et al., 2016). However, this technique relies on passive sensors, \n\nwhich in turn are constrained by cloud coverage (Caldeira et al., 2014). This is a significant \n\nlimitation for this particular study, since Cape Verde is often under cloudy conditions due to the \n\nseasonal positioning of the ITCZ (Fernandes et al., 2000; Karstensen et al., 2015). Furthermore, it \n\nis important to note that the overestimation of Chla concentration may occur \u2013 provoked by the \n\npresence of aerosols and dust load in the atmosphere, and suspended sediments in surface water \n\n(Helmke et al., 2005; Tilstone et al., 2011). This dataset was recorded by the Moderate Resolution \n\nImaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument flying aboard NASA Aqua satellite. It has a \n\nviewing swath width of ~2330 km in a sun synchronous polar orbit, providing an almost complete \n\nglobal coverage in one day (Savtchenko et al., 2004).  \n\n3.6. Sea Surface Temperature \n\nLastly, SST was provided by the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature \u2013 a group \n\ncomposed by several international partners that assembles and delivers SST data obtained from 10 \n\ndifferent satellite sensors (GHRSST, 2017). It offers a wide variety of spatial resolutions, from \n\ninfra-red high-resolution instruments limited by cloud cover, to microwave coarser-resolution \n\ninstruments with little limitations (Kaiser et al., 2012). It is intended to be used as an auxiliary \n\ndataset for eddy identification, considering that anticyclonic (cyclonic) eddies have a distinct warm \n\n(cold) SST signature at its core (Robinson, 2010). It is also a valuable tool for the regional oceanic \n\ncharacterisation, since it can detect major mesoscale features, such as fronts, upwelling episodes \n\nand filaments that may originate at the Mauritanian coast (e.g., Mittelstaedt, 1983; Van Camp et \n\nal., 1991; Gabric et al., 1993; Barton et al., 1998; Lathuili\u00e8re et al., 2008; Meunier et al., 2012).  \n\nhttps://oceandata.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODIS-Aqua/Mapped/\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\n4. Results  \n\nConsidering the exploratory nature of the current study, only the most relevant results are \n\npresented in this section. Further supplementary material \u2013 such as sequential 8-day average plots \n\nfor wind, current, ADT, Chla, and SST \u2013 was produced in order to observe the mesoscale variability \n\nin space and time. As part of a preliminary analysis, these results are extremely relevant, in the \n\nsense that it determined with great extension the planning and execution of the study. However, \n\ngiven the substantial number of plots (and the digital memory size), only the SLA and eddy \n\ntrajectories 5-day sequential plots are included in digital format as supplementary material.  \n\nIn the first part of this chapter a general approach was performed, converging into a more \n\ndetailed characterisation along the process. Thus, the initial analysis is focused on the 12-year \n\nannual mean and seasonal description of the regional eddy signatures. Secondly, a zoom in \n\napproach is conducted in order to characterise the eddy field within and around the archipelago. At \n\nthis stage, special attention is given to the geographical distribution and descriptive statistics of the \n\neddy kinematic properties. Subsequently, far-field eddies that are generated at the Mauritanian \n\ncoast and move westward into the Cape Verde area are assessed, with the main objective of \n\ndetermining spatial and temporal patterns, as well as the island-eddy interaction. For that, specific \n\neddy trajectories are presented and further described. Then, following the same approach as the \n\nlatter, the near-field eddy characterisation is conducted. Lastly, the local biological realm is \n\ncharacterised, along with the main mechanisms supporting it \u2013 i.e., remote enrichment and IME.  \n\nDifferent eddy-lifetime thresholds were used, depending on the nature of the analysis being \n\nperformed. It is very important to filter the spurious from the most relevant eddies and still have a \n\nsufficiently large population to execute a robust geographical and statistical characterisation. \n\nConversely, many eddy trajectories plotted in a map can superimpose each other, masking \n\nimportant patterns such as their origins and evolution in space and time. A series of thresholds were \n\ntested (1, 7, 30, 60 and 90 days; Annex C: and Annex D:) in order to find the ones that, without \n\ncompromising the most relevant signals and patterns, could be used for the two main analysis. As \n\nsuch, a 1, 30 and 60-day thresholds were set for the descriptive statistics (and respective graphical \n\nrepresentations), for the eddy kinematic geographical distribution and for the characterisation of \n\nthe far and near-field eddies dynamics, respectively.  \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\n4.1. Regional Eddy Signatures \n\nFor the purpose of inferring the eddies dynamic signature in the regional oceanographic \n\nbackground, particularly their geographical and seasonal patterns, the 12-year annual and seasonal \n\nEKE field is further described. EKE is one of the most elementary parameters in this kind of studies, \n\nmainly because the representation of such parameter makes the main eddy hotspots and pathways \n\nobvious and easy to detect (Figure 4.1 and Figure 4.2). Furthermore, EKE signals represent the \n\nenergy exclusively induced by eddies in the environment, but it does not discriminate eddy hotspots \n\nfrom pathways. Only the intensity and the frequency of the such features can be traced. Given the \n\nfact that an area of extremely elevated EKE levels is present between the 4 and 9\u00baN, two different \n\nareas and respective colormaps were defined. A grey-scale colormap with a bigger range was used \n\nfor the southernmost and northernmost area. These areas are of less interest and are hereinafter \n\nreferred as the \u201cgrey area\u201d. As for the main study area, a \u201crainbow\u201d colormap with a smaller range \n\nwas used. \n\nThe most evident feature in the 12-year mean EKE map (Figure 4.1) is easily identified as a \n\ntransversal band of high EKE values, varying from ~40 to more than 100 cm2.s-2. It extends the \n\nentire tropical basin (16 \u2013 50\u00baW), from Cape Blanc to the south-westernmost region. Within this \n\nband, the highest values are detected in the proximity of Cape Blanc and north of the windward \n\nislands, with values reaching ~100 cm2.s-2. The latter signal is characterised by an elongated shape, \n\nand although it is still within the major transversal band of high EKE, one should not neglect the \n\npossibility of an independent pathway for far-field turbulent mesoscale features. \n\nAnother area of great interest is located west of Fogo Island (25\u00baW), in the leeward group of \n\nislands. This feature is detached from the previous zonal band, because it is quite isolated from the \n\nlatter and its signal is confined into a circular area. It has approximately 1\u00ba (~111 km) diameter and \n\npresents EKE values in the order of ~100 cm2.s-2.  \n\n Two other areas of significant EKE values are shown: one located in the African coast at 11\u00baN \n\nlatitude; and another in the opposite side of the regional study area. However, due to their locations, \n\nthese areas are not relevant for the present study. In the \u201cgrey area\u201d, a significant EKE signal covers \n\nthe entire zonal extend, with values reaching more than 1000 cm2.s-2 in the western section. \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 \u2013 Mean EKE for the 12-year study period in the region of Cape Verde.  \n\nIn respect to the seasonal EKE signal, Figure 4.2 shows significant differences between the four \n\nseasons. A characterisation for all seasons follows:  \n\nSpring: the transversal band is not so pronounced as in the annual mean, but high values are \n\nstill present near Cape Blanc and north of the windward islands (~140 and ~80 cm2.s-2, \n\nrespectively). In this season, the most notable features are around the Cape Verde Archipelago. \n\nThe previously described confined area west of Fogo Island presents a strong EKE signal, with \n\nvalues around 160 cm2.s-2. Furthermore, it is possible to observe what it seems to be a major eddy \n\npathway south of Fogo Island with values between 60 and 140 cm2.s-2. The latter has an initial \n\nsouth-westward direction (from approximately 20\u00baW 15\u00baN to 26\u00baW 10\u00baN), turning westward in the \n\nfinal segment (for more 3\u00ba longitude). In the south-westernmost part of the figure, an extremely \n\nhigh EKE signal appears, but due to its location is not relevant for the current study. \n\nSummer: It is during this season that the transversal basin-wide band of high EKE is more \n\nevident, showing its maximum seasonal EKE values varying from 80 to 140 cm2.s-2. Features \n\npreviously identified around the archipelago diminishes in area and strength or even disappear, as \n\nit is the case of the circular area west of Fogo Island, and the case of the major pathway previously \n\nidentified south of the archipelago, respectively. Conversely, new features arise in the African \n\ncoast. One band is located near Cape Vert, following very closely the coastline in a northward \n\norientation. Another band is located up north, detaching from the coastline and seemingly merging \n\nthe quasi-permanent signal at Cape Blanc.   \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\nAutumn: the background EKE signal decreases dramatically in the main study area, being the \n\nbasin-wide band the most evident feature, especially northward of the windward islands. An \n\nextremely strong signal appears in the south of the regional study area, showing evidences of the \n\n\u201cgrey area\u201d northward seasonal migration. Another signal appears in the coastal zone of Guinea-\n\nBissau, being of less interest due to its location.   \n\nWinter: The transversal band of high EKE signal disappears almost completely. The elongated \n\nsignal north of the windward group is still present, with values around 60 cm2.s-2, reinforcing the \n\nhypothesis of a pathway independent from the transversal band. High EKE signals (~100 cm2.s-2) \n\nreappear around the archipelago, more specifically between the windward and the leeward group, \n\nand downwind of the Fogo Island. It is difficult to define these signals as distinct eddy pathways \n\nor places of origin, due to the elongated shapes. An interesting feature extending the oceanic area \n\nbetween the African coast and the archipelago is the apparent eddy trail, with values around 60 and \n\n80 cm2.s-2. It originates near Cape Vert and then divides in two branches south-east of the \n\narchipelago, which then seemingly appear to merge the previously described areas (north and south \n\nof the leeward Island).  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 \u2013 Mean seasonal EKE for the 12-year study period in the region of Cape Verde. \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\n4.2. Eddy Statistics and Geographical Distribution \n\nIn this section, the main characteristics of the eddy field within and around the archipelago are \n\npresented, together with the eddy kinematic properties and respective statistics. Two geographical \n\nareas are defined: the general study area (hereinafter referred as outside area) is set between 32 \u2013 \n\n13\u00baW and 9 \u2013 23\u00baN; and the Cape Verde area (hereinafter referred as CV area), is set to be at \n\napproximately 2\u00ba (~222 km) distance from the nearest islands, covering the area between 27 \u2013 \n\n21\u00baW and 13 ? 19\u00baN. Although the general study area covers a significantly broader area, it is the \n\ncoastal area that deserves special attention \u2013 since most of the far-field eddies are generated there. \n\nNevertheless, CV is the area of greatest interest. The statistical graphical representation of the eddy \n\nkinematic properties (histograms, upper-tail cumulative histograms and boxplots) follows the \n\npreviously described eddy classification, in which the upper panel includes all eddies (regardless \n\nof lifetime) that were created inside the CV area; and the lower panel includes exclusively the ones \n\nthat were created outside CV, but still within the study area. Furthermore, eddies are classified in \n\nthree main groups, based on minimum lifetime: short (&lt;30 days), medium (? 30 days) and long-\n\nlived (? 60 days) eddies. \n\nA total number of 14822 eddies are identified between 2003 \u2013 2014 in the study area, in which \n\n2282 (15 %) are created in CV (Table 4.1). The polarity ratio remains evenly distributed for the \n\nstudy area, whereas in CV area anticyclonic eddies seem to be dominant over cyclonic eddies, \n\nincreasing its dominance concurrently with the threshold\u2019s increase. Expectedly, the total number \n\nof eddies decreases significantly with the threshold\u2019s increase: 50%, 86% and 96% of the total \n\npopulation is lost when applying a 7, 30 and 60-day threshold, respectively (Table 4.1).   \n\nTable 4.1 \u2013 Number of eddies identified per minimum lifetime.  \n\n \n\nTotal (rate) \nCyclonic Eddies \n\n(%) \n\nAnticyclonic Eddies \n\n(%) \n\nAll eddies \nStudy Area 14822 (1235 yr-1) 7407 (50 %) 7415 (50 %) \n\nCV Area 2282 (190 yr-1) 1118 (49 %) 1164 (51 %) \n\n? 7 days \nStudy Area 8006 (667 yr-1) 4002 (50 %) 4004 (50 %) \n\nCV Area 1433 (119 yr-1) 690 (48 %) 743 (52 %) \n\n? 30 days \nStudy Area 2101 (175 yr-1) 1052 (50 %) 1049 (50 %) \n\nCV Area 452 (38 yr-1)  217 (48 %) 239 (52 %) \n\n? 60 days \nStudy Area 676 (56 yr-1) 330 (49 % 346 (51 %) \n\nCV Area 151 (13 yr-1) 71 (47 %) 80 (53 %) \n \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\nThe exponential pattern is well represented in Figure 4.3, where red (anticyclonic) and blue \n\n(cyclonic) bars have a 7-day interval. Through the normal and the upper-tail cumulative histograms \n\nit is possible to observe that both areas follow a similar behaviour, and that the \n\ncyclonic/anticyclonic ratio is in equilibrium. Nevertheless, an initial ~10% difference is present \n\nbetween the two areas, as 70% and 80% of the CV and outside observations, respectively, is \n\nconcentrated in the first 4 weeks. The boxplots confirm the previous observations, as CV eddies \n\nhave on average slightly higher lifetime expectancy that the outside eddies (19.62 and 15.18 days, \n\nrespectively; Table 4.2). Still, the maximum eddy lifetime recorded inside CV area was almost 250 \n\ndays, while for the outside eddies it reached ~370 days.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3 \u2013 Lifetime statistical distribution. From left to right: Histograms, representing the number of eddies (two left panels); \n\nupper-tail cumulative histograms, representing the percentage of observations (third panel); and boxplots (forth panel).   \n\nAs the threshold increases to 7, 30 and 60 days, the percentage of CV eddies in relation to the \n\nentire study area also increases to 17 %, 21 % and 22 %, respectively (Table 4.1). These results are \n\nquite significant, since CV area accounts for only 16% of the total study area. The latter can be \n\neasily seen in Figure 4.4, which aims to assess eddy hotspots, as well as the prevailing eddy lifetime \n\nassociated with such areas \u2013 i.e., short, medium and long-lived eddies.  \n\nFrom a preliminary analysis it seems obvious that, as the lifetime threshold increases, the \n\nnumber of eddies originating in the coastal area loses its dominance to the CV area.  Regarding all \n\neddies (? 1day lifetime), some hotspots are evident near Cape Blanc and in the southernmost \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\nAfrican coastal area, with values in the order of 200 and 170 \u2013 220 eddies, respectively. Within the \n\nCV area, most of the boxes near the islands have a record of approximately 80 \u2013 100 new eddies, \n\nwhich is significant but still not far from the background signal. For the 7-day threshold, however, \n\nthe geographic patterns start to shift. The Cape Blanc area is still the main eddy hotspot, with ~110 \n\nnew eddies, whilst the southernmost coastal area loses most of its significance. The CV area retains \n\nmost of the eddies seen in the previous threshold, becoming more highlighted. When applying a \n\n30-day threshold the result is even more evident. The area near Cape Blanc is close to the \n\nbackground values, with the generation of only ~20 eddies. The western African coast, especially \n\nnear Cape Vert, shows some signals of long-lived eddies generation (17 \u2013 24). The CV area, \n\nhowever, presents a considerable number of eddies generated in the lee of Santo Ant\u00e3o (~30) and \n\nFogo (~27) islands. Finally, the 60-day threshold reduces significantly the number of eddy origins, \n\nas most of the background signal weakens. The most distinctive areas identified in the 1 and 7-day \n\nthresholds are lost, while the areas in the downwind regions south of Santo Ant\u00e3o and Fogo islands \n\nbecome even more pronounced. The area between Cape Vert and Cape Timiris also shows \n\nevidences of long-lived eddy generation, though not so evident as in CV area.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4 \u2013 Geographical distribution of the number of eddies generated in every 1\u00ba \u00d7 1\u00ba box, filtered per lifetime threshold. \n\nBlack thick lines represent the CV area. \n\n(a) (b) \n\n(c) (d) \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\nRegarding the eddy origins seasonal patterns, a brief characterisation is further presented, taking \n\nonly into account medium and long-lived eddies. The most obvious patterns presented in Figure \n\n4.5 are located in the lee of the two highest islands \u2013 Santo Ant\u00e3o and Fogo. Spring seems to be \n\nthe most homogeneous season \u2013 especially in CV area \u2013 with values between 5 and 9 evenly \n\ndistributed in the area around the islands. During summer, however, the signal is concentrated in \n\nthe lee of Santo Ant\u00e3o and Santiago Islands, while at the Mauritanian coast the signal expands \n\nmeridionally in 3\u00ba. A similar pattern is present in Autumn, but the area southwest of Fogo Island \n\nbecomes the dominant region \u2013 with the generation of 11 eddies \u2013, while the area south of Santo \n\nAnt\u00e3o remains unchanged and the area between the windward and leeward groups reaches its \n\nmaximum recorded values. Lastly in winter, the area near Cape Vert, Cape Blanc and south of \n\nFogo Island have the highest number of eddies generation \u2013 these being 9, 9 and 12, respectively.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.5 \u2013 Geographical distribution of the number of medium and long-lived eddies (? 30 days lifetime) generated in every 1\u00ba \n\n\u00d7 1\u00ba box, filtered per boreal seasons.

Eddy Kinematic Properties  \n\nThe study of the eddy kinematic properties is essential in order to understand their nature and \n\nbehaviour. As such, the geographical distribution of the main eddy parameters is represented in \n\nFigure 4.6, in which every box represents the average value of all eddies generated there. Along \n\nwith the characterisation of the latter, the eddy parameter descriptive statistics (Table 4.2) and \n\nrespective graphical representations are also introduced. It is important to note that the geographical \n\nrepresentation of such properties only includes eddies that have a minimum lifetime of 30 days (7 \n\nand 60-day representation in Annex E:), but the descriptive and graphical statistical \n\ncharacterisation includes all eddies, regardless of the lifetime.   \n\n \n\nFigure 4.6 \u2013 Geographical distribution of the mean eddy kinematic properties, considering medium and long-lived (? 30 days) \n\neddies generated in every 1\u00ba \u00d7 1\u00ba box.  \n\n(a) (b) \n\n(c) (d) \n\n(e) \n(f) \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\nTable 4.2 \u2013 Descriptive statistics of the eddy kinematic properties: CV and Outside Eddies \n\n \nCV Eddies Outside Eddies \n\nCyclonic Anticyclonic Cyclonic Anticyclonic \n\nNumber of Eddies 1118 1164 6289 6251 \n\nLifetime \n\n(days) \n\nMax 243 210 365 340 \n\nMin 2 2 2 2 \n\nMean 19.36 19.88 15.21 15.16 \n\nTravel \n\nDistance \n\n(km) \n\nMax 1599.33 1091.59 1717.51 1394.15 \n\nMin 0.34 0.1 0.04 0.23 \n\nMean 93.85 96.11 80.44 77.96 \n\nTranslation \n\nSpeed \n\n(cm.s-1) \n\nMax 14.23 14.83 29.82 31.16 \n\nMin 0.2 0.05 0.02 0.13 \n\nMean 5.46 5.55 6.35 6.34 \n\nRadius \n\n(km) \n\nMax 190.24 174.95 221.56 255.64 \n\nMin 30.52 30.5 30.09 30.09 \n\nMean 53.84 52.95 56.31 55.6 \n\nAmplitude \n\n(cm) \n\nMax 9.71 6.97 24.23 31.29 \n\nMin 0.03 0.03 0.02 0.02 \n\nMean 0.89 0.81 1.17 1.13 \n \n\nFor the travelled distance (Figure 4.6a), there is no obvious pattern at first sight. This can be \n\nexplained by the fact that some boxes have a very low number of eddies with lifetime ? 30 days \n\n(Figure 4.4), which leads the average travel distance to be disproportional in some cases, being \n\nultimately misleading. The latter is reinforced in Annex E.1, where eddies with lifetime ? 7 days \n\nare considered. Considering that the travel distance is directly proportional to the eddy lifetime \u2013 \n\nwith a considerable 0.9 linear correlation (Figure 4.7) \u2013, one may assume that the mean \n\ngeographical and statistical distribution for the eddy travel distance and lifetime are very closely \n\nrelated. A similar statistical representation as the one generated for the eddy lifetime (Figure 4.3) \n\nwas conducted for the travelled distance, but due to the striking similarity it is provided in Annex \n\nG.1. Most eddies of both areas (CV and outside) have a short travel distance, as approximately \n\n60% of the total population do not exceed the 50-km distance (Annex G.1). Some eddies can travel \n\nfor long distances (>1000 km), though the mean value is about 94 and 79 km for CV and outside \n\neddies, respectively.  \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.7 \u2013 Scatter plot and linear correlation between eddy lifetime and travel distance. Colour scale represents data density. Red \n\ncircle represents the longest eddy trajectory (C1), identified in Figure 4.23. \n\nThe number of eddy terminations is represented in Figure 4.6b. In this subplot, each box \n\naccounts only the number of eddies that terminate there. The pattern seems to be randomly \n\ndistributed, since the boxes with higher number are dispersed around the study area. The objective \n\nhere was to verify if the far-field eddies intersection with the archipelago could leave a noticeable \n\nsignature, but this is not the case.  \n\nRegarding the eddy polarity distribution, the ratio between anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies is \n\nrepresented in Figure 4.6c. The latter was log10 transformed for the purpose of normalization. As \n\nsuch, positive (red) and negative (blue) values indicate the dominance of anticyclonic and cyclonic \n\neddies, respectively, while empty boxes indicate an equilibrium between the two polarities. In \n\ngeneral, this figure is in perfect agreement with Table 4.1, as a vast number of white boxes is \n\nobserved and the number of red and blue boxes seem to be counterbalanced. Nevertheless, some \n\nareas appear to have a predominant polarity. Anticyclonic eddies are prevalent in the coastal zone \n\nand on most boxes inside the CV area, particularly the ones that have a higher than average number \n\nof eddy origins \u2013 in the lee of Santo Ant\u00e3o and Fogo islands (Figure 4.4). However, cyclonic eddies \n\nare scattered around the study area and do not show a distinctive pattern. Several boxes have a very \n\nstrong signal (1 or -1), indicating that only cyclonic or anticyclonic eddies were generated there. \n\nThis result is biased by the small number of eddies originated in the respective areas and should be \n\nneglected.  \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nThe average translation speed per box is represented in Figure 4.6d. A distinctive spatial \n\npattern is present, as higher speed eddies (? 7 cm.s-1) seem to originate south and west of the CV \n\narea. In fact, CV area appears to act as an impediment to eddy propagation, since the boxes between \n\nthe archipelago and the coastal area, as well as the ones within the delimited area, have predominant \n\nlow translation speeds. From the statistical graphical representation (Figure 4.8), this pattern is also \n\nperceivable. CV eddies travel at a mean speed of approximately 5.54 cm.s-1 (4.78 km.d-1), while \n\noutside eddies travel at a mean speed of approximately 6.35 cm.s-1 (5.49 km.d-1) (Table 4.2). The \n\ndifference in maximum values is even more impressive, since outside eddies can reach a mean \n\nmaximum translation speed of approximately 30 cm.s-1 (25.92 km.d-1), while CV eddies do not \n\nexceed ~14 cm.s-1 (12.1 km.d-1) (Table 4.2). The latter is further reinforced by the boxplots in \n\nFigure 4.8, where the number of outliers is significantly higher for outside eddies. This parameter \n\nis the only one that follows a gaussian curve \u2013 meaning that the population is symmetrically \n\ndistributed, with a higher concentration of values approximately at the centre of the distribution.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.8 \u2013 Translation speed statistical distribution. From left to right: Histograms, representing the number of eddies (two left \n\npanels); upper-tail cumulative histograms, representing the percentage of observations (third panel); and boxplots (forth panel).   \n\nThe average radius geographical distribution is represented in Figure 4.6e, along with the \n\nrespective statistical representation in Figure 4.9. Considering that the eddies radius is calculated \n\nas a function of the area (Equation 7), it is reasonable to expect that the area associated with such \n\nfeatures follows the same distribution of the eddies radius (Annex G.2) \u2013 as the correlation between \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\nthese two parameters is quite significant (0.93, Annex G.3). Furthermore, the scale of an eddy is \n\nhighly dependent on the altimetry spatial resolution, leading the detectable eddies to have a \n\nminimum radius of approximately 30 km (Table 4.2). The most evident pattern in this subplot is \n\nvery similar to the one described in the previous subplot, in the sense that higher values are located \n\nin lower latitudes. An interesting signal can be found in the lee of Fogo Island, an area that was \n\nidentified in the previous Figure 4.4 as a hotspot for medium and long-lived eddies. Here, the mean \n\nradius reaches an approximate 105 km length, which is quite significant since the average for the \n\nCV and outside eddies is about 53 and 56 km, respectively (Table 4.2). Like the eddy distance \n\n(Figure 4.6a) and polarity ratio (Figure 4.6c), some boxes with very high values are identified in \n\nthe map, but are biased from the small number of eddies being accounted for the mean and should \n\nbe neglected. From the boxplots it is possible to observe that eddies generated outside CV have a \n\nslightly higher radius than the CV eddies. However, the latter can be explained by the fact the mean \n\neddy radii tend to increase with lower latitudes, which in turn are mostly located outside CV area. \n\nThe upper tail cumulative histograms confirm that the two groups of eddies follow each other\u2019s \n\ndistribution very closely, as an exponential distribution is easily observed. From the analysis of the \n\ngeographical and the descriptive statistical distribution, one may conclude that the Cape Verde \n\nArchipelago does not have a major influence on the eddy radius, being the variation in latitude the \n\nprincipal factor.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.9 - Radius statistical distribution. From left to right: Histograms, representing the number of eddies (two left panels); upper-\n\ntail cumulative histograms, representing the percentage of observations (third panel); and boxplots (forth panel).   \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\nLastly, the eddies amplitude is further characterized. This parameter represents the difference \n\nin SSH from the higher (lower) extreme to the lower (higher) SSH contour of the cyclonic \n\n(anticyclonic) eddy. The geographical distribution in Figure 4.6f indicates that, in general, eddies \n\ngenerated in the coastal area have a higher amplitude (from 2 to 3 cm) in comparison with the rest \n\nof the study area. The mean values for CV and outside eddies are around 0.86 and 1.15 cm (Table \n\n4.2), respectively. Nevertheless, the most remarkable signal arises once again from the medium \n\nand long-lived eddy hotspot \u2013 in the lee of Fogo Island \u2013 exceeding a significant 5 cm amplitude. \n\nFrom the normal and the upper-tail cumulative histograms in Figure 4.10, an exponential \n\ndistribution is evident, as most of the population is skewed to the low values area. For the CV area, \n\ncyclonic eddies appear to have a slightly higher amplitude than anticyclonic eddies, as the blue line \n\n(cyclonic) in the upper-tail cumulative histograms detaches from the red line (anticyclonic) at \n\naround 4 cm amplitude. The latter is also confirmed by the mean values, which are 0.89 and 0.81 \n\ncm for cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies, respectively (Table 4.2).  \n\n \nFigure 4.10 \u2013 Amplitude statistical distribution. From left to right: Histograms, representing the number of eddies (two left panels); \n\nupper-tail cumulative histograms, representing the percentage of observations (third panel); and boxplots (forth panel).   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\n4.3. Far-field Eddies \n\nAfter a first statistical analysis, a more detailed characterisation is presented. The far-field \n\neddies are defined as eddies that are originated outside CV area but pass by or terminate inside the \n\ndelimited area. The main objective here is to characterise and assess the impact of these eddies on \n\nthe archipelago (and vice-versa), as well as its nature and behaviour. Only long-lived eddies (? 60 \n\ndays lifetime) are accounted from this point onwards, representing approximately 23 % and 34 % \n\nof the total cyclonic and anticyclonic far-field eddies, respectively (Annex H.1). From this \n\nselection, eddies that are not relevant for the current analysis \u2013 those that are created near the CV \n\narea and trespass the delimitation, even if they do not pose a significant impact on the archipelago \n\n\u2013 are successfully eliminated, without jeopardising the eddies of interest (Annex C:).   \n\nFar-field eddies trajectories and points of origin are presented in Figure 4.11. All eddies travel \n\nwestward, with some meridional deflections along the way. Anticyclonic eddies seem to be the \n\ndominant polarity, as most trajectories and points of origin are represented in red. At latitudes \n\ncomprising the archipelago (15 \u2013 17\u00baN), it seems obvious that the incoming eddies cannot advance \n\nfurther than the islands. Thus, a shadow effect is created with the archipelago acting as a barrier. \n\nThis effect is even more noticeable at higher latitudes, where the eddy trajectories do not intersect \n\nthe islands and are thus able to continue their path, reaching longitudes as far as 30\u00baW.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.11 \u2013 Far-field long-lived (? 60 days) eddy trajectories (left panel) and points of origin (right panel). Blue and red colours \n\nrepresent cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies, respectively. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\n The easternmost islands of the archipelago are undoubtedly the most impacted by incoming \n\neddies \u2013 specially Sal, Boa Vista, Maio and Santiago \u2013 because most far-field eddies are generated \n\nbetween those latitudes and, as they travel west, they end up interacting with the islands. The \n\nwindward group (Santo Ant\u00e3o, S\u00e3o Vicente, Santa Luzia and S\u00e3o Nicolau; Figure 2.1) receives \n\neddies mostly with a south-westward direction, although there are some exceptions from the east. \n\nThe leeward group, however, only receives eddies that originate east of CV, with some exceptions \n\ncoming from southeast. In fact, Fogo is the only Island that is not reached by any long-lived far-\n\nfield eddy, as it seems to be sheltered by the Santiago and Maio islands.  Regarding the eddy \n\norigins, anticyclonic eddies are predominant near Cape Vert and Cape Blanc, with the appearance \n\nof some cyclonic eddies near the Mauritanian coast. Many of the far-field eddies are created north \n\nof the archipelago, whereas very few of them are created in the south. \n\nAs far-field eddies need to travel longer distances to be considered as such, their kinematic \n\nproperties (Annex H.1) are generally higher than the ones created inside and outside CV area (Table \n\n4.2). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the incoming eddies are, in general, more robust than \n\nmost of the others.  \n\nAll eddies show evidences of meridional deflections. These variations are presented in Figure \n\n4.12, as a function of longitudinal propagation. In the left panels, long-lived eddy trajectories are \n\nplotted from a common point of origin by subtracting the initial position (coordinates) from the \n\ntrajectory. The right panels show the histograms of the meridional variation between the final and \n\nthe initial position of each eddy. The histograms are skewed poleward for the cyclones and \n\nequatorward for anticyclones, with a mean azimuth of 0.29\u00ba poleward and 0.28\u00ba equatorward, \n\nrespectively. The difference in the dominant meridional sign is quite significant, as 60 % of the \n\ncyclonic eddies have a predominant poleward deflection, while the anticyclonic have an almost \n\nidentical result (57 %) in the opposite direction. Some of these patterns can be identified in Figure \n\n4.11, as red trajectories seem to have a predominant south-westward direction \u2013 mainly those \n\ncreated at higher latitudes (> 17\u00baN), and blue trajectories seem to propagate mostly in the north-\n\nwestward direction \u2013 especially those created at lower latitudes (&lt;15\u00baN). Furthermore, anticyclonic \n\neddies appear to travel longer distances than the cyclones. However, Annex H.1 shows that long-\n\nlived cyclonic eddies (? 60 days) travel, on average, ~11 km more than anticyclonic eddies, though \n\nthe latter have higher maximum distances \u2013 which in turn is associated with those eddies that are \n\ngenerated at higher latitudes, intersect CV area but fail to interact with the islands (Figure 4.11).  \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.12 - Meridional deflections of the cyclonic (upper panels) and anticyclonic (lower panels) long-lived (? 60 days) far-field \n\neddies. The left panels show the changes in longitude and latitude relative to the initial location of each eddy. The right panels \n\nshow histograms of the average azimuth of each eddy trajectory. \n\nTime-latitude plots (Hovm\u00f6ller diagrams) were computed using a meridional cross-section set \n\nin the eastern CV boundary (21\u00baW) and between the latitudes from 12 \u2013 19\u00baN. Although some \n\neddies approach the archipelago from north and south, most of them come from east (Figure 4.11), \n\nthus the positioning of the cross section. The main objective here is to identify far-field eddy \n\nsignatures and to assess its frequency in space and time. As such, two variables are represented in \n\nFigure 4.13, with the SLA (computed from the ADT and the 12-year MDT) in the upper panel, and \n\nthe EKE in the middle panel. The usage of these two different (but intrinsically connected) datasets \n\nis based on the fact that both variables complement each other, in the sense that eddy-induced \n\nsignals are easily detectable in the EKE panel, but the SLA panel holds information regarding their \n\npolarity. The latitudinal average for both variables is represented in the lower panel, where the \n\nanomaly (red for positive, blue for negative) and the light-blue linear plot represent the SLA and \n\nEKE datasets, respectively. It should be noted that, as all eddies travel westward, the x-axis (which \n\nrepresents time) orientation was shifted from left to right to facilitate the interpretation. Moreover, \n\na SLA linear trend (~3.77 mm.yr-1) was found in the meridional cross-section (Annex I.1), and \n\nconsidering that the latter could bias positive and negative signals, the dataset was detrended. \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\nThe final months of all the years are characterised by positive SLA, whereas the first months \n\nare marked by negative values (Figure 4.13). Some punctual and localised positive (anticyclonic) \n\nand negative (cyclonic) SLA signals are identified, though the positive seem to be more frequent \n\nthan the negative \u2013 which is in agreement with Figure 4.11. The EKE panel is marked by identical \n\nsignals, which validates the relationship between both datasets. Cyclonic eddies seem to occur \n\nmostly during late spring and summer. Nevertheless, anticyclonic eddies are also found during that \n\nperiod, as it is the case of the year 2008 \u2013 when 4 anticyclones are evident in the SLA panel. Most \n\nof the strongest EKE signatures (~1000 cm2.s-2) are found between 12 \u201316\u00baN and are normally seen \n\nfrom late Autumn to spring. For example: in December 2003 (14 \u2013 16\u00baN) and November 2005 (12 \n\n\u2013 14\u00baN) it is possible to identify one cyclonic (C0) and another anticyclonic eddy (A0), respectively \n\n(circled in black). Those signals extend 2\u00ba in latitude, indicating that the diameters of such features \n\nwere ~222 km length. Nevertheless, there are some remarkable events occurring all year round, as \n\nit is the case of the years between 2008 and 2012. This period was, unequivocally, the one with the \n\nhighest number of far-field eddies entering the CV area. It was also the one in which the eddy \n\nsignatures were more distributed in space and time.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.13 \u2013 Zonal Hovm\u00f6ller diagrams for SLA (upper panel) and EKE (middle panel) along 21\u00baW and the latitudes from 12 \u2013 \n\n19\u00baN (eastern CV boundary in Figure 4.11). Identified signals represent specific far-field eddy cases. In the lower panel, the latitude-\n\naveraged SLA and EKE are represented by the anomaly plot (left axis) and the blue line (right axis), respectively.   \n\nA5 \n\nC1 \n\nA2 \n\nA1 \nC0 \n\nA0 \n\nC0 \n\nA0 \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\nAs a seemingly seasonal signal was identified for both variables, the seasonality of the SLA and \n\nEKE far-field zonal signatures were computed, where each day from January to December \n\nrepresents the average of the all respective days between the 12-year study period (Figure 4.14). In \n\nthe SLA panel a seasonal pattern is evident. Minimum SLA values (~ -4.5 cm) are reached in May, \n\nwhile maximum values (~6.2 cm) are observed between October and December. The strong \n\nseasonal signal hampers the identification of eddy signals. In the EKE panel, however, a seasonal \n\npattern seems to exist in the months of January and August, though with low maximum values \n\n(~300 cm2.s-2). Nevertheless, all the other months show evidences of relatively high EKE values \n\n(150 \u2013 200 cm2.s-2), which leads to the conclusion that there are no obvious seasonal eddy \n\nsignatures in this cross-section.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.14 - Seasonal zonal Hovm\u00f6ller diagrams for SLA (upper panel) and EKE (middle panel) along 21\u00baW and the latitudes \n\nfrom 12 \u2013 19\u00baN (eastern CV boundary in Figure 4.11). In the lower panel, the latitude-averaged SLA and EKE are represented by \n\nthe anomaly plot (left axis) and the blue line (right axis), respectively.   \n\n  \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\n4.3.1. Specific cases \n\nFar-field eddies are subjected to many processes in their transition to offshore, especially when \n\ninteracting with the archipelago of Cape Verde. The main objective in this analysis is to assess the \n\noutcomes of such interaction. As such, the period of 19th March 2006 \u2013 2nd May 2007 was selected \n\nfor the characterisation of 9 eddy trajectories. The latter is divided in two parts, represented in \n\nFigure 4.15 and Figure 4.16. Many eddies are present in the selected timesteps, but only the ones \n\nmost representative of the processes in focus are identified and characterised. A sequential \n\ncharacterisation follows, in which each paragraph is dedicated to each timestep.  \n\nFirst in 19th of March 2006 (Figure 4.15a), three anticyclonic eddies arise at distinct locations: \n\nA1 is created west of Cape Vert, very close to the CV delimitation; A2 is created west of Mauritania \n\ncoast; and A3 is created southwest of Cape Blanc.  \n\nAfter almost 4 months (2nd July 2006, Figure 4.15b), A1 and A3 show a significant southward \n\nmeridional deflection in their westward translation. Consequently, A1 avoids a direct interaction \n\nwith the leeward group of islands, while the intersection of A3 with the windward group becomes \n\nmore likely to happen. A2 continues at approximately the same latitude, with some minor \n\nmeridional deflections along the way.  \n\nFifteen days later (17th July 2006, Figure 4.15c), A1 gets farther from the archipelago and \n\ncontinues propagating south-westward, while A3 propagates steadily in a westward orientation. \n\nA2, on the other hand, intersects the westernmost islands of the windward group (Santo-Ant\u00e3o, \n\nS\u00e3o Vicente, Santa Luzia and S\u00e3o Nicolau, Figure 2.1). At the same time that this eddy is under \n\ntransformation and the outer perimeter extends in longitude, another eddy of the same polarity (A4) \n\noriginates south-west of Santo-Ant\u00e3o. This eddy, however, seems to be part of the same SLA body \n\nas the A3. Still in the same date, a dipole SLA signal appears north of Cape Vert, giving origin to \n\na cyclonic (C1) and anticyclonic (A5) eddy.  \n\nTen days later (27th July 2006, Figure 4.15d), A1 gets even farther away from the archipelago, \n\nwhile A3 keeps its westward propagation without any significant change. A2 however, is \n\nconsidered terminated by the eddy tracking algorithm, although some of its SLA signal remains \n\nvisible. On the opposite side of the windward islands, A4 increases in amplitude and initiates a \n\nwestward propagation to offshore, though it outer delimitation is still attached to the remaining A2 \n\nSLA body. At the coast, the newly generated C1 and A5 eddies seem to be entangled, as the \n\nanticyclonic and cyclonic eddies moved north-westward and south-eastward, respectively.    \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\nAnother 10 days latter (6th August 2006, Figure 4.15e), A1 loses its southward component and \n\npropagates exclusively to west, while A3 increases in area and continues its westward translation. \n\nA4 gets more robust while propagating westward \u2013 increasing in area and amplitude \u2013, and the \n\nouter periphery becomes more compact. At the coast, C1 and A5 appear to continue entangled, \n\nthough the former increases significantly in amplitude, while the latter almost disappears.  \n\nAlmost 2 months later (5th October 2006, Figure 4.15f), A1 is considered terminated after a \n\nshort sequential southward and northward deflection, but some of its SLA signal remains visible. \n\nA3 deflects significantly to the south, entering in a collision line with the windward islands and \n\nextending its outer periphery. The A4 suffers a slightly southward deflection while propagating \n\nwestward. An interesting behaviour is seen at the coast, when C1 and A5 detach from each other. \n\nAt this moment, C1 inverts its direction from east to west, while the A5 ceases its northward \n\ndirection and propagates almost exclusively westward.   \n\nTen days later (15th October 2006, Figure 4.15g), A3 is given as terminated after its \n\nsouthernmost area intersects Santo Ant\u00e3o Island, though its SLA body keeps propagating south-\n\nwestward (doted contour). A4 keeps its translation without any notable change, while C1 and A5 \n\nsuffer a minor southward deflection at approximately the same instant.  \n\nFinalising the Part I of the selected period (4th November 2006, Figure 4.15f), the new A6 \n\narises from the terminated A3 SLA body, west of Santo-Ant\u00e3o. The A4 continues propagating west \n\nas previously observed. The A5 propagates south-westward, getting further away from the islands, \n\nwhile the C1 moves westward in the direction of the easternmost group of islands (Sal, Boa Vista \n\nand Maio, Figure 2.1). \n\nIn the continuation of the previous sequences, Part II is represented in Figure 4.16. In 19th of \n\nNovember 2006 (Figure 4.16a), A4 and A6 continue their translation westward, along with C1, \n\nwithout any significant change. A5, however, is considered terminated as most of the SLA signal \n\nseems to dissipate.  \n\nAlmost 1 month later (14th December 2006, Figure 4.16b), A4 and A6 are given as terminated, \n\nas their SLA signal seems to have dissipated completely. Concurrently, C1 increases its amplitude \n\n(from -1 to -4 cm), becoming more robust and closer to the eastern islands, with the outer perimeter \n\nintersecting Boa Vista Island.  \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\nApproximately one month and a half later (2nd February 2007, Figure 4.16c), C1 intersects in \n\nits entirety the eastern group of islands. Consequently, the eddy seems to be deflected southeast, \n\nwhile the eastern branch gets elongated and extends zonally until it reaches Fogo Island.  \n\nOnly five days later (7th February 2007, Figure 4.16d), a new eddy arises (C2) in the northern \n\nside of Fogo, in what it seems to be part of the previously described elongated branch of C1. At the \n\nsame time, C1 loses some of its amplitude and remains approximately at the same location, \n\ncontinuing interacting with Boa Vista and Maio Islands. \n\nTwelve days later (19th February 2007, Figure 4.16e), a second eddy (C3) is created southwest \n\nof Fogo, in what seems to be another elongated branch of C1 and C2. C2 increases in area and \n\nremains at approximately at same location, while C1 gets weaker and moves slightly to the west in \n\nthe direction of Maio Island.  \n\nIn the 4th of March 2007 (Figure 4.16f), C1 is considered terminated, as all of its SLA signal \n\nis lost when intersecting Maio. C2 and C3 detach from the common SLA body, significantly \n\nincreasing their amplitude by >10 and 8 cm, respectively. Both eddies appear to have a similar \n\npropagation direction with a strong north-westward component.    \n\nTen days later (14th March 2007, Figure 4.16g), C2 is terminated as most of its SLA body \n\nseems to merge with C3. Consequently, the latter increases in amplitude and in size.  \n\nIn the last sequence (2nd May 2007, Figure 4.16h), C3 is considered terminated after \n\npropagating north-westward, but most of its signal persists in the SLA field, though significantly \n\nmore elongated than before. In fact, after a cautious analysis of the supplementary material, it was \n\nobserved that this eddy continues propagating westward until it vanishes completely from the SLA \n\nfield at around 40\u00baW, between 9th and 16th of November 2007 (6 months later). \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.15 \u2013 Far-field eddies evolution from 19th March 2006 to 4th November 2006, plotted against SLA maps (Part I).

Near-field Eddies \n\nFollowing the same kind of analysis as the one conducted for the long-lived far-field eddies \n\n(previous sub-chapter), the long-lived near-field eddies are further characterised. These are defined \n\nas eddies that are created inside the CV area. What differs from the previous analysis is merely the \n\nnature and the mechanisms behind the generation of such features, which are most likely to be \n\ndriven by the islands interaction with the atmosphere and/or the ocean. Nevertheless, it is also very \n\nlikely that some of these eddies result from the interaction of the far-field eddies with the \n\narchipelago. Only 71 (~6 %) and 80 (~7 %) of the total near-field cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies, \n\nrespectively, were selected for this analysis (Table 4.1). In this case, the application of a 60-day \n\nfilter was extremely important, since the number of eddies with lower lifetime is significantly \n\nhigher than for the far-field eddies, hampering the analysis and interpretation of spatial patterns \n\n(Annex D:).  \n\nThat being said, long-lived near-field eddy trajectories (bigger panel) and points of origin \n\n(smaller panel) are represented in Figure 4.17. The most noticeable pattern is, as for the far-field \n\neddies (Figure 4.11), the dominant westward orientation with some meridional deflections. A \n\nconsiderable number of eddies are observed to originate in the lee of the archipelago\u2019s highest \n\nislands (Santo Ant\u00e3o and Fogo) \u2013 which in turn is in accordance with Figure 4.4. The majority of \n\nthese eddies have an anticyclonic polarity. Some eddies are originated east and north of the islands, \n\nbut in fewer numbers. Due to their location, the latter are most likely to be caused by processes \n\nother than island-induced perturbations, thus they are not so relevant for the current analysis. The \n\nlength of the trajectories is considerably high, with a mean value of approximately 480 and 454 km \n\nfor cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies (Annex J.1), respectively, which is expected due to the \n\nminimum lifetime threshold applied. One of the most interesting patterns is related to the \n\npropagation of the eddies that originate in the lee of Fogo Island. Here, almost all the red tracks \n\nhave a very similar behaviour, with a clear south-westward orientation and identical extensions. \n\nNear this area, an agglomerate of long-lived cyclonic eddy origins appears to dominate the area \n\nbetween Fogo and Santiago islands. Despite the proximity to the former group of eddies, the latter \n\nhave a predominant westward propagation. Still, the travelled distances seem identical, except for \n\none large track (C1) that almost reaches 40\u00baW. This specific eddy has a very interesting behaviour, \n\nwhen at approximately 30\u00baW starts deflecting south-westward at a constant rate. Given the \n\npeculiarity of such eddy, some attention was regarded towards the characterisation of the latter in \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\nthe next section (Figure 4.23), being also identified in the previous Figure 4.7 and in the following \n\nFigure 4.18 as the longest eddy track on record, and in the following Figure 4.19 as the most \n\ndistinctive eddy signal in the EKE field. In the windward group of islands, cyclonic tracks (blue) \n\nare more evident because of their extension, being able to reach longitudes far west of 35\u00baW. In \n\nfact, the maximum travelled distances for cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies is approximately 1600 \n\nand 1091 km, respectively, though the mean values are only 15 km apart (Annex J.1).  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.17 - Near-field long-lived (? 60 days) eddy trajectories (main panel) and points of origin (smaller panel). Blue and red \n\ncolours represent cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies, respectively.  \n\nThe difference in maximum travelled distance is well noticeable in Figure 4.18, where the \n\nmeridional deflection for every track is presented. It is well clear that 6 specific cyclonic tracks \n\nhave exceptional extensions (around 1100 \u2013 1600 km). However, if these tracks were excluded, the \n\naverage travel distance for cyclonic eddies would be quite lower, as the remaining eddies have a \n\nrelatively short extension. Even more remarkable, however, is the difference in the main meridional \n\ntrack orientation. While cyclonic eddies do not show a significant trend for equatorward or \n\npoleward propagation, it is obvious that this is not the case for anticyclonic eddies. In fact, 63 % \n\nand 38 % of the anticyclones have a dominant equatorward and a poleward propagation, \n\nrespectively. Moreover, the mean azimuth for such eddies is approximately 0.48\u00baS. On the other \n\nhand, cyclonic eddies are more evenly distributed, with 49 % and 51 % of the long-lived population \n\nC1 \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\npropagating equatorward and poleward, respectively. As expected, the mean azimuth for cyclonic \n\neddies is considerably lower than for anticyclonic eddies (0.14\u00baN).  \n\n \nFigure 4.18 - Meridional deflections of the cyclonic (upper panels) and anticyclonic (lower panels) long-lived (? 60 days) near-field \n\neddies. The left panels show the changes in longitude and latitude relative to the initial location of each eddy. The right panels show \n\nhistograms of the average azimuth of each eddy trajectory. \n\nHovm\u00f6ller diagrams were computed for the near-field eddies. Considering that many eddies \n\npropagate through the southern CV boundary, one additional meridional cross section was \n\nperformed (Figure 4.17). Very few eddies are exported offshore through the northern CV boundary, \n\nand those that are, are most likely to be generated by mechanisms other than the ones in focus. \n\nThus, these eddies are neglected from the current analysis.  \n\nThe zonal Hovm\u00f6ller is set in the western CV boundary (26\u00baW) and covers the latitudes \n\nbetween 12 \u2013 19\u00baN (Figure 4.19). The x-axis is oriented from right to left to simulate the westward \n\neddy propagation. Furthermore, the SLA was detrended as trend of approximately 3.60 mm.yr-1 \n\nwas found (Annex K.1). The SLA seasonal pattern is not so evident in this diagram, although the \n\ndominance of positive values is recurrent in the last months of several years. The SLA panel shows \n\nevidences of an exceptional period between 2010 and 2012, when a predominant positive SLA \n\nsignal is clear. This period is even more evident in the anomaly plot represented in the lower panel. \n\nC1 \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\nSeveral cyclonic (negative) and anticyclonic (positive) signals are dispersed throughout space and \n\ntime, though cyclonic eddies are more often observed in the first half of the year.  \n\nIn the EKE panel, a remarkable number of high value signals is observed, following the same \n\nbehaviour as the SLA. The latter is also evident in the lower panel, where the latitudinal averaged \n\nEKE is represented in blue and is marked by a highly dynamic pattern. The most evident pattern, \n\nhowever, is easily identified between 14 \u2013 16\u00baN. This persistent band of high EKE values (? 1000 \n\ncm2.s-2) is present in all the years, though with variable intensity. In conjunction with the upper \n\npanel, it is possible to link these signals to cyclonic eddies, while the anticyclonic eddies seem to \n\nbe associated with lower EKE values. Judging from the EKE signal extensions, the eddy diameters \n\ncan vary between 1\u00ba and 4\u00ba degrees in length (~111 and ~444 km, respectively). The perfect \n\nexample of an eddy footprint is observed in late 2004 \u2013 beginning 2005 between 14 \u2013 16\u00baN. This \n\nsignal belongs to the previously identified C1 and is, undoubtedly, the clearest on the EKE record \n\nso far. As it propagates westward at low speeds, the eddy centroid distinguishes from the eddy \n\nperimeter as a point of low EKE values, circled by very high values (? 1000 cm2.s-2).  \n\n \nFigure 4.19 - Zonal Hovm\u00f6ller diagrams for SLA (upper panel) and EKE (middle panel) along 26\u00baW and the latitudes from 12 \u2013 \n\n19\u00baN (western CV boundary in Figure 4.17). Identified signals represent specific near-field eddy cases. In the lower panel, the \n\nlatitude-averaged SLA and EKE are represented by the anomaly plot (left axis) and the blue line (right axis), respectively. \n\nC1 \n\nC1 \n\nC2 \n\nC2 \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\nIn order to assess the seasonal behaviour of the SLA and EKE datasets, the 12-year daily \n\naverage was computed and is presented in Figure 4.20. From the analysis of the upper panel, a \n\nseasonal pattern seems to exist, as positive values mark the final 3 months of the year. Cyclonic \n\nsignals are recurrent in April, June and September, whereas anticyclonic signals are more difficult \n\nto determine. However, only the cyclonic signal identified in June has a corresponding counterpart \n\nin the EKE panel (though with a negative time-lag), with values exceeding 500 cm2.s-2. Besides \n\nthis, some other EKE signals are observed, but do not show an obvious corresponding pattern in \n\nthe SLA panel.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.20 \u2013 Seasonal zonal Hovm\u00f6ller diagrams for SLA (upper panel) and EKE (middle panel along 26\u00baW and the latitudes from \n\n12 \u2013 19\u00baN (western CV boundary in Figure 4.17). In the lower panel, the latitude-averaged SLA and EKE are represented by the \n\nanomaly plot (left axis) and the blue line (right axis), respectively.   \n\nLongitude-time plots were computed along the southern CV boundary (13\u00baN) and for the \n\nlongitudes between 21 \u2013 27\u00baW.  This specific Hovm\u00f6ller diagram differs from the previous, in the \n\nsense that the x and y-axis are shifted. As the eddy propagation follows a south-westward \n\norientation at this location (Figure 4.21), the time axis (y-axis) starts from the top, in order to \n\nsimulate the passage of eddies through the cross-section and facilitate the interpretation. The SLA \n\ndataset was detrended, after a trend of approximately 5.05 mm.yr-1 was found (Annex L.1).  \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\nFollowing the same behaviour as the previous Hovm\u00f6ller diagrams (Figure 4.13 and Figure \n\n4.19), positive SLA characterise the final months of all year within the study period. However, the \n\nmost evident pattern seen in both SLA and EKE panels is related to the orientation of the eddy \n\nsignals. Most of the them start around 24\u00baW longitude and then propagate westward as time \n\nprogresses, resulting in a tilted orientation. Furthermore, the SLA panel presents evidences of \n\nmostly positive signals, indicating the dominance of anticyclonic eddies. The latter two statements \n\nare in perfect conformity with the dominant eddy polarity and propagation in that area (Figure \n\n4.21). Regarding the time frequency, there seems to exist a recurrent anticyclonic signal in the first \n\nmonths of all years, at almost exactly the same location (24\u00baW). Cyclonic signals are sometimes \n\nvisible, but do not show any significant spatial or temporal pattern. In fact, the latter appear to be \n\nassociated with the low EKE signals dispersed through the middle panel.  \n\n \nFigure 4.21 \u2013 Meridional Hovm\u00f6ller diagrams for SLA (left panel) and EKE (middle panel) along 13\u00baN and the longitudes from 21 \n\n\u2013 27\u00baW (southern CV boundary in Figure 4.17).

This figure is, undoubtedly, the \n\none which better represents a seasonal signal in both far-field and near-field eddies. The \n\npredominant positive and negative SLA values are again well noticeable in the last and initial half \n\nof the year, respectively. Moreover, the previously observed south-westward signal orientation is \n\nevident in both panels. Two distinct EKE signals are observed in January and March-April (~350 \n\nand ~500 cm2.s-2, respectively), very likely to be associated with the seasonal pattern observed in \n\nFigure 4.21. However, only the signal from March-April finds a correspondence in the SLA panel, \n\nwhich in turn is in conformity with the anticyclonic dominant polarity (Figure 4.21).  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.22 \u2013 Seasonal meridional Hovm\u00f6ller diagrams for SLA (left panel) and EKE (middle panel) along 13\u00baN and the longitudes \n\nfrom 21 \u2013 27\u00baW (southern CV boundary in Figure 4.17).

Specific cases \n\nBased on the results previously described, a great number of eddies are reported to originate \n\nin the lee of the major islands of Cape Verde. In order to investigate the nature and the evolution \n\nof such features, the period of 24th of December 2004 \u2013 10th of August 2005 was selected, based \n\non the number of eddies suitable for the purpose. Five seemingly island-induced eddies were \n\nidentified and are represented in Figure 4.23. All eddies are most likely to be generated by the \n\nisland interaction with the atmosphere and/or the oceanic background. The latter also means that, \n\ndue to the complexity of the system, the possibility of a near-field eddy to result from the interaction \n\nof incoming far-field eddies with the archipelago, or even with near-field eddies, cannot be fully \n\ndisregarded. As for the previous far-field eddy specific cases, many eddies are present in the \n\nselected timesteps, but only the ones most representative of the processes in focus are identified \n\nand characterised. As such, a detailed description of the latter follows.  \n\nOn the 24th December 2004 (Figure 4.23a), an anticyclonic eddy (C1) forms in the lee of Fogo \n\nIsland.  Almost two months later (26th February 2005, Figure 4.23b), this eddy is seen propagating \n\nwestward, after propagating first north-westward. Concurrently, one anticyclonic eddy (A1) \n\noriginates almost at the same location of C1.  \n\nOn 14th of March 2005 (Figure 4.23c) one anticyclonic eddy (A2) originates in the lee of Santo-\n\nAnt\u00e3o, while C1 continues translating west. A1 on the other hand, propagates eastward during the \n\ninitial phase, becoming significantly larger \u2013 with a diameter of approximately 3\u00ba (333 km) \u2013 and \n\nincreasing its amplitude (~10 cm). \n\nAlmost 1 month later (13th April 2006, Figure 4.23d), another cyclonic eddy arises (C2) west \n\nof Fogo Island, though with very small dimensions. C1 continues its translation following the same \n\norientation as before. A1 changes its course and initiates a south-westward propagation, while A2 \n\nfollows the same direction as A1. \n\nOne month later (13th May 2006, Figure 4.23e), another cyclonic eddy is created south of \n\nSanto Ant\u00e3o, with an initial southward direction. At this time, 4 eddies are simultaneously \n\ninteracting with each other, while C1 gets farther away from the islands. A1 travelled a remarkable \n\ndistance of approximately 240 km in the south-westward direction, while A2 keeps its previous \n\norientation. C2 continues its southward direction, but with a small deflection to west. \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\nOn 7th of June 2006 (Figure 4.23f), the eddy trajectories remain almost identical to the previous \n\ntimestep, with minor changes. A1 loses some of its amplitude to ~6 cm. An interesting change is \n\nobserved in the C2 trajectory, as it acquires a westward dominant direction. C1 also seems to deflect \n\nslightly southward, while it translates westward.  \n\nAlmost 1 month later (2nd July 2005, Figure 4.23g), A2 is given as terminated. Part of its signal \n\nseems to merge A1, which also appears to be in the process of dissipating, as its amplitude \n\ndecreases and its diameter expands significantly. The C1 keeps its previous trajectory, but its \n\nsouthward component seems to increase. Even more interesting is the pattern observed in the C2 \n\nand C3 eddies, as their trajectories changes dramatically, with a north-westward direction.  \n\nFinally, all eddies are given as terminated after more than 1 month (10th August 2006, Figure \n\n4.23h). C1, C2 and A1, however, seem to have a premature termination, as part of their SLA signal \n\nis still present in the figure (delimited by a black dotted line). Now that all eddies are terminated, \n\nthe most interesting pattern is linked to the distinct characteristics between cyclonic and \n\nanticyclonic eddy trajectories. Only C1 follows a different behaviour. \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.23 \u2013 Near-field eddies evolution from 24th December 2004 to 10th August 2005, plotted against SLA maps.

Biological Characterisation  \n\nThe primary productivity in the vicinity of Cape Verde is further characterised, with the main \n\nobjective of inferring temporal and spatial patterns, the archipelago susceptibility to remote \n\nbiological enrichment through far-field features (especially eddies), and the local biological \n\nenrichment (IME) through near-field island-induced eddies. For that, three approaches are \n\nintroduced. First, the seasonal characterisation of the surface Chla concentration in the previously \n\nintroduced general study area is conducted. Subsequently, a longitude-time diagram (Hovm\u00f6ller) \n\nis presented for the determination of the temporal variation of the Chla extension from coastal to \n\noffshore waters. Lastly one specific case of remote enrichment and one specific case of IME are \n\npresented and characterised.   \n\nThe seasonal Chla mean for the study period are represented in Figure 4.24, overlapped by the \n\nseasonal mean ocean surface currents. The most obvious pattern is related with the resemblance \n\nbetween the two different datasets, in which the very pronounced seasonal patterns seem to follow \n\neach other very closely. During spring, the coastal Chla concentrations reaches its maximum \n\nextension offshore, spreading over an approximate 4\u00ba (~444 km) length. At the coast, the \n\nconcentration almost exceeds a remarkable 30 mg.m-3, progressively decreasing to ~0.3 mg.m-3 \n\nuntil the longitude of Cape Verde. In the archipelago it is possible to observe a localised Chla \n\nenhancement in the immediate proximity of the islands \u2013 especially Fogo \u2013 of up to 2 mg.m-3. The \n\nocean surface currents have a linear south-westward orientation from the coast to the archipelago, \n\nbecoming turbulent when intersecting the islands. One cyclonic and anticyclonic dipole feature is \n\nobserved in the lee of Fogo Island, whereas one cyclonic eddy is observed in the lee of Santo Ant\u00e3o.  \n\nDuring summer, the Chla concentration is pushed northward, concurrently with the northward \n\nocean current at the coast. In fact, the coastal Chla seems to be supressed by the latter, which when \n\nintersecting the westward current near Cape Blanc creates a cyclonic gyre which then serves as an \n\nexport mechanism of Chla to offshore waters. The extension of such mechanism almost reaches \n\nthe archipelago from northwest, with some fragmentations of the latter with concentrations around \n\n1 mg.m-3 getting very close from the easternmost windward islands. In the lee of Fogo Island, a \n\nvery pronounced anticyclonic eddy is perceivable.   \n\nIn Autumn, the costal ocean current reaches its northernmost extension. Consequently, Chla \n\nconcentration is suppressed and pushed northward until it intersects the westward NEC at Cape \n\nBlanc (Figure 2.4). However, the extension of the offshore transport, in relation with the previous \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\nseason, is considerably shorter. A new \u2013 but less pronounced \u2013 offshore extension arises near the \n\nCape Vert promontory with concentrations around 2 mg.m-3, though surface currents do not follow \n\nthe same behaviour.  \n\nLastly in winter, high Chla concentration extend from the coastal zone to offshore, seemingly \n\nreaching the archipelago with concentrations at approximately 1 mg.m-3. As expected, the latter \n\nseems to be driven by the ocean surface currents, which follow a dominant westward direction. \n\nPronounced patches of high Chla concentration are observed in the vicinity of the archipelago, \n\nwith values between 1 \u2013 2 mg.m-3. In fact, it is during this season when higher concentration are \n\nobserved around Cape Verde. However, it is difficult to classify the origin of such enhancement, \n\ni.e., from remote or local enrichment. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.24 \u2013 Seasonal Chla surface concentrations (coloured) and currents (streamlines).   \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\nThe inter-annual extension of the Chla surface concentration from the African coast to offshore \n\nis represented in Figure 4.25. As observed in the previous Figure 4.24, a seasonal pattern is well \n\nperceivable along the years. Highest concentrations are seen during the first and final months of all \n\nthe years, with concentrations reaching ~30 and ~1 mg.m-3 at the coast and in the longitudes \n\ncomprising the archipelago, respectively. The extension of the Chla signal reaches the westernmost \n\nposition in late spring and early summer. At the longitudes between Santo Ant\u00e3o and Boa Vista, \n\nhighest Chla concentrations take place between January and March, with values in the range of 0.5 \n\nand 1 mg.m-3. Tough, there are some exceptions, as it is the case of 2009 and 2014 \u2013 when the \n\ncoastal-offshore Chla export reaches the archipelago during June. The apparent connection \n\nbetween the coastal and offshore Chla concentrations hampers the distinction between remote and \n\nlocal Chla enrichment, making the quantification of the IME inconclusive. \n\n \nFigure 4.25 \u2013 Longitude-time diagram (Hovm\u00f6ller) of the Chla inter-annual variability, averaged between 13 \u2013 19\u00baN. Black solid \n\nlines represent the longitudinal location of the easternmost (22.6\u00baW) and westernmost (25.2\u00baW) islands of the archipelago (Boa \n\nVista and Santo Ant\u00e3o, respectively).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\n4.5.1. Specific Cases  \n\nHaving into account the existence of two types of driving mechanisms for the local primary \n\nproductivity, the periods from October 2013 to March 2014 and from October 2009 to January \n\n2010 were selected, being representative of a remote (Figure 4.26) and local biological enrichment \n\nscenario (Figure 4.27), respectively. Nevertheless, it has been observed that both mechanisms can \n\ncoexist simultaneously. In fact, the interaction of both distinct mechanisms is the most frequent \n\nscenario in the region, being virtually impossible to find isolated cases for both mechanisms. In \n\norder to facilitate the interpretation, both representations only include the Chla surface \n\nconcentration, but for the identification of the driving mechanisms responsible for such features, \n\nthe computation of the mean ocean surface currents was also considered and are included in Annex \n\nM:. Furthermore, monthly Chla mean concentrations proved to be the best solution for the current \n\nanalysis, avoiding large gaps that are provoked by the very frequent cloud cover.  \n\nFirst, the remote enrichment scenario (Figure 4.26) is characterised. In October 2013 it is \n\nobserved the apparent existence of a coastal filament with high Chla concentration in Cape Blanc. \n\nWithin its offshore expansion, a fragment (circled in red, possibly an anticyclonic eddy; Annex \n\nM.1) detaches from the filament transporting significant Chla concentrations (~20 mg.m-3) in the \n\ndirection of the archipelago. In November 2013, this feature continues propagating in the same \n\ndirection, though with less pronounced Chla concentrations (1 \u2013 2 mg.m-3), while the coastal \n\nfilament near Cape Blanc retracts. In December 2013, the latter south-westward propagating \n\nfeature intersects the archipelago, as the Chla concentrations in its vicinity increases substantially \n\nin relation to the previous months, reaching values as high as 5 mg.m-3. In the subsequent months, \n\nthe local Chla concentrations remain constant, with values between 1 \u2013 10 mg.m-3. Concurrently, \n\nthe adjacent costal area is marked with enhanced Chla levels, especially near the Cape Vert \n\npromontory in February and March 2014. Some coastal filaments extend offshore, almost reaching \n\nthe archipelago. Nevertheless, it is possible that some fragments reach the islands, promoting local \n\nprimary production. An interesting Chla signal (circled in light blue) is observed during February \n\n2014 at approximately 28\u00baW \u2013 13\u00baN. The latter can be a result of two scenarios: the advection \n\ninduced by an anticyclonic eddy, or the nutrient injection induced by a cyclonic eddy. However, \n\nthere are no evidences of such features in Annex M.1, which can be a result of the monthly average \n\napplied for the ocean current \u2013 as such procedure may indiscriminately filter mesoscale features \u2013 \n\nor the small eddy size that may not be detectable in the altimetry sensor.   \n\n\n\n72 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.26 \u2013 Biological remote enrichment scenario. Monthly Chla means from October 2013 to March 2014. Red and light blue \n\nareas represent remote and local enrichment, respectively. \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \n\nLastly, the local enrichment scenario is presented in Figure 4.27. One far-field feature (circled \n\nin red, possibly an anticyclonic eddy; Annex M.2) is observed in all the months. This patch of high \n\nChla concentrations approaches the archipelago from the northeast, similarly to the previously \n\ndescribed remote enrichment case (Figure 4.26), fainting away as it propagates. The most \n\nremarkable Chla signal, however, is depicted in the lee of Fogo Island in January 2010 (circled in \n\nlight blue), reaching values of up to 20 mg.m-3. This signal is only present in January. Moreover, \n\nthe area in which it arises has been linked to the generation of island-induced eddies in the previous \n\nsub-chapters. Therefore, such occurrence may be possibly linked to a punctual and localised \n\nbiological response to the injection of nutrients from deep layers to the euphotic zone through \n\nEkman-suction.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.27 \u2013 Biological local enrichment scenario.

Discussion \n\nA great deal of results was presented and characterised in the previous chapter, which may lead \n\nthe reader to be overwhelmed with such an amount of information. Thus, the main objective here \n\nis to link and discuss the most meaningful results, so that the big picture can be eloquently retained.  \n\n5.1. Eddy Hotspots and Pathways \n\nThe identification and characterisation of the predominant eddy birthplaces and pathways is \n\nextremely important for several reasons. First, it promotes the knowledge and comprehension of a \n\nlocalised oceanic region (e.g., a group of islands or a specific coastal area), and subsequently its \n\nimpact on a regional scale. Secondly, it determines with great extension the nature of the eddies \n\nbeing generated there, such as their lifetime and propagation expectancy. Thirdly, it can provide \n\nvaluable information about the biogeochemical characteristics of the water being transported in the \n\ninterior of the eddies, which can have a significant impact in whatever comes in their way. \n\nTherefore, the far and the near-field eddies are further assessed.  \n\n5.1.1. Far-field Regions \n\nCoastal areas have been largely associated with mesoscale variability (Chelton et al., 2011), \n\nespecially when characterised by an upwelling system (Barton et al., 1998; 2004; Chaigneau et al., \n\n2008). Naturally, the northwest African coastal area is no exception (Mittelstaedt, 1983; Chaigneau \n\net al., 2009, Sch\u00fctte et al., 2016a).  \n\nFrom current results, it has been observed that the Cape Blanc promontory is marked by an \n\nimportant EKE signal all year round (Figure 4.1), being more pronounced during spring and \n\nsummer (Figure 4.2). This location is characterised by intense along-slope flow convergence and \n\nhas been often linked to the generation of a giant filaments and eddies, that promote the transport \n\nof cold, nutrient-rich upwelled water to offshore (Van Camp et al., 1991; Gabric et al., 1993; \n\nPelegri et al., 2006; Fischer et al., 2009; Nieto et al., 2012). The latter is further reinforced in Figure \n\n4.26 and Figure 4.27, where a filament appears to give origin to enhanced Chla patches that \n\npropagate offshore in the direction of Cape Verde Archipelago. In fact, this region has been \n\nrecently recognized as a small eddy corridor (Sangr\u00e0 et al., 2009). The designation of a major eddy \n\nhotspot is also supported in Figure 4.4, as the adjacent area holds a considerable number of newly-\n\ngenerated eddies (~200 and ~100 for 1 and 7-day thresholds, respectively) \u2013 which in turn is in \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \n\ngood agreement with Sch\u00fctte et al. (2016a). The latter authors detected (in the same region) the \n\ngeneration of at least 50 eddies with a minimum 7-day lifetime and 45-km radius, between 1995 \n\nand 2013. The difference in the number of eddy origins between the latter and current studies is \n\nvery likely related with the eddy-detection method being used, as Sch\u00fctte et al. (2016a) relied on \n\nthe Okubo-Weiss technique (Okubo, 1970; Weiss, 1991) instead of the SLA-based method \n\n(Faghmous et al., 2015a). It is important to note that this hotspot only exists when accounting for \n\nshort-lived eddies (1 and 7-days thresholds), which leads to the conclusion that it is dominated by \n\nshort-lived eddies. The latter also means that eddies originated here are very unlikely to reach the \n\nCape Verde Islands, since a short lifetime implies a short propagation range (Figure 4.7). \n\nConsidering that the archipelago is at a 600-km distance from Cape Blanc, eddies would need to \n\nbe active for at least ~130 days to be able to reach the islands. This hypothesis is further validated \n\nin Figure 4.11, where very few of the represented far-field eddies originate near Cape Blanc.  \n\nCape Blanc also marks the starting point of a very pronounced thermohaline frontal zone, \n\nknown as the Cape Verde Frontal Zone (CVFZ, Figure 2.4), which separates the salty, warm, \n\nnutrient-poor and oxygen-rich NACW from the fresh, cold, nutrient-rich and oxygen-poor SACW \n\n(Zenk et al., 1991; Stramma and Siedler, 1998; Zhang et al., 2003; Pastor et al., 2008). This front \n\nhas been recognized as a major source of mesoscale eddies in the region (Onken and Klein, 1991), \n\nbeing also linked to the generation of the previously referred Cape Blanc filaments (Meunier et al., \n\n2012). Coincidently, it is the starting point of the transversal band of high EKE that goes across the \n\nentire zonal length of the tropical Atlantic Ocean, clearly depicted in Figure 4.1. The signal\u2019s \n\norientation seems to follow very closely the positioning of the CFVZ \u2013 which also goes across the \n\nentire Atlantic Ocean (Emery and Meincke, 1986; Lozier et al., 1995) \u2013 and the positioning of the \n\nwestward propagating NEC, which is conversely related with the CVFZ (Zhang et al., 2003). The \n\nlatter is in good agreement with Reverdin et al. (2003), who state that major current systems are an \n\nimportant source of EKE \u2013 especially in regions less affected by topography \u2013 and are thus \n\nimportant sources of eddies (Pond and Pickard, 1983). This also explains the reason why the \n\nsouthernmost latitudes present extremely high EKE (to the point that a different colour scale had \n\nto be implemented, Figure 4.1 and Figure 4.2), directly linked to the presence of the NECC (Figure \n\n2.4, L\u00e1zaro et el., 2005).   \n\nIn the area between Cape Vert and Cape Timiris promontories, the EKE increases significantly \n\nin summer (Figure 4.2), merging the Cape Blanc branch at higher latitudes. This happens \n\n\n\n76 \n\n \n\nconcurrently to the maximum intensification and extension of the MC (Figure 2.6, Mittelstaedt, \n\n1991, L\u00e1zaro et al., 2005). Sch\u00fctte et al., 2016a strongly associated the latter current to the \n\nformation of eddies that propagate westward in the direction of Cape Verde. Furthermore, the latter \n\nauthors designated this season as the period of maximum eddy generation at the coast, and linked \n\nthe eddy generation mechanisms to the dynamic instabilities associated with MC. This is further \n\nconfirmed in the seasonal eddies origins (? 30 days) representation (Figure 4.5). Hence, this area \n\ncan be defined as a seasonal hotspot for medium and long-lived far-field eddies9. In fact, two of \n\nthe selected far-field eddies approaching the archipelago (C1 and A5, Figure 4.15) originate during \n\nthis season. According to Sch\u00fctte et al., 2016a, coastal-generated eddies created in June normally \n\nintersect the archipelago between boreal winter and spring. The latter is in good agreement with \n\nFigure 4.13, as most of the eddy signatures are perceivable during that period, though some are \n\nperceivable earlier in late Autumn (as it is the case of the previously referred C1 and A5 eddies) \u2013 \n\nwhich in turn is related to the fact that the latitudinal cross-section is 2\u00ba (~222 km or ~40 days \n\ntravel time \u2013 Figure 4.7) east from the easternmost islands.  \n\nNotwithstanding, an interesting EKE trail starting in the immediate vicinity of the Cape Vert \n\nheadland is observed in winter \u2013 when the northwest African upwelling system reaches its \n\nsouthernmost extension (Van Camp et al., 1991; Nykj\u00e6r and Van Camp, 1994; L\u00e1zaro et al., 2005) \n\n\u2013 possibly indicating an important far-field eddy pathway in the direction of the leeward group of \n\nislands (Figure 4.2). Several medium and long-lived eddies have been observed to originate in this \n\nlocation (Figure 4.4) \u2013 especially during winter (Figure 4.5) \u2013 being most of them of anticyclonic \n\nnature (Figure 4.6c)10. In this case, it is reasonable to assume that these eddies can transport nutrient \n\nand Chla-enhanced water at their cores, which in turn must have a direct impact on the \n\narchipelago\u2019s biological realm. Alpers et al. (2013) documented the formation and evolution of a \n\nsub-mesoscale (not detectable on altimetry sensors) cyclonic eddy generated by the headland \n\ntopographic effects on the wind. This eddy transported upwelled nutrient rich water through \n\napproximately 200 km offshore, causing a phytoplankton bloom in oligotrophic waters, until it \n\ndisintegrated 31 days after being generated. Sch\u00fctte et al., 2016a also documented a substantial \n\nnumber of eddies being generated near Cape Vert, in which cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies \n\n                                                 \n9 Coastal-generated far-field eddies can only be medium and long-lived eddies, since coastal-generated short-lived \n\neddies do not reach the archipelago (Annex C.1 andAnnex C.2). \n10 In fact, all the 4 long-lived far-field eddies originated in this area are anticyclonic (Figure 4.11). \n\n\n\n77 \n\n \n\ndominated the areas north and south/southwest of the headland, respectively. Having into account \n\nthat the latter authors used a 7-day minimum lifetime threshold, their results are consistent with the \n\ncurrent study, when applying an equal threshold (Annex E.1). \n\n5.1.2. Near-field Regions \n\nFrom the far-field to the near-field, the CV area is further discussed. Deep ocean islands have \n\nbeen reported to induce significant disturbances in the adjacent environment (e.g., Xie et al., 2001; \n\nChavanne et al., 2002), ultimately resulting in the generation of mesoscale eddies (e.g., Sangr\u00e0 et \n\nal., 2005; 2007; 2009; Jia et al., 2011; Caldeira et al., 2014) and consequent nutrient injection and \n\nphytoplankton blooms in presumably oligotrophic environments (e.g., Simpson and Tett, 1986; \n\nAr\u00edstegui et al., 1994; Basterretxea et al., 2002; Hasegawa et al., 2004; 2009). The occurrence of \n\nmesoscale eddies in the immediate proximity of the Cape Verde archipelago have seldom been \n\ndocumented (L\u00e1zaro et al., 2005; Chaigneau et al., 2009; Sch\u00fctte et al., 2016a) and the mechanisms \n\nsupporting such features remain to be investigated. By contrast, such mechanisms have been \n\nsubject of intense studies in other regions, mainly in the Hawaii (Calil et al., 2008; Yoshida et al., \n\n2010; Jia et al., 2011), Canary Islands (Ar\u00edstegui et al., 1997; Sangr\u00e0 et al., 2007; Jim\u00e9nez et al., \n\n2008) and Madeira Island (Couvelard et al., 2012; Caldeira et al., 2014). Curiously, remarkable \n\nsimilarities can be found between these archipelagos and Cape Verde, in the sense that all groups \n\nare characterised by high topography \u2013 which in turn is well above the local inversion layer \n\n(Chavanne et al., 2002; Hafner and Xie, 2003) \u2013, and are exposed to constant incident trade winds. \n\nNotwithstanding, the current case of Cape Verde differentiates from the previous studies in one \n\nparticular \u2013 but extremely relevant \u2013 way. Such studies focused on the mechanisms and \n\nimplications induced by the islands themselves \u2013 being by atmospheric or oceanic effects (or both) \n\n\u2013 but very few have considered the implications of the interaction between far-field eddies and \n\nisland-induced eddies. Considering the archipelago\u2019s exposure to such incoming features, it is thus \n\nreasonable to expect that some of the near-field eddies may be a product of the inevitable \n\ninteraction between incoming far-field eddies and the islands. In that sense, the Cape Verde \n\narchipelago represents an exceptional case study, which should be regarded with caution.  \n\nConsidering the size of the delimited CV area in relation to the general study area, the number \n\nof medium and long-lived near-field eddies is quite remarkable (Figure 4.4; Table 4.1). The lee of \n\nFogo and Santo Ant\u00e3o Islands \u2013 the highest of the archipelago, with 2829 and 1979 meters altitude, \n\n\n\n78 \n\n \n\nrespectively (Figure 2.2; Annex A.1) \u2013 are undoubtedly the most pronounced eddy hotspots (Figure \n\n4.4c and Figure 4.4d). However, these regions were only distinguished from the surrounding \n\nenvironments when applying a 30 and 60 lifetime threshold. This may be evidence that many \n\nspurious features were identified by the eddy tracking algorithm, hence the need for filtering the \n\ndataset and analysing only the most robust eddies. Such pattern is also depicted in the near-field \n\nlong-lived eddy trajectories and origins representation (Figure 4.17), where anticyclonic eddies \n\nappear to be dominant (Table 4.1) \u2013 which is in agreement with Chaingneau et al. (2009) \n\nobservations in the lee of Cape Verde and is also a characteristic in other regions (e.g., Sangr\u00e0 et \n\nal., 2009; Chelton et al., 2011). According to Cushman-Roisin et al. (1990), this dominance is \n\nrelated to the fact that anticyclonic eddies are generally more robust and merge more freely than \n\ncyclones, and cyclonic eddies show a higher tendency for self-destruction. These near-field eddy \n\nhotspots are in perfect agreement with Sch\u00fctte et al. (2016a), in which the areas previously referred \n\nare defined as the most prominent eddy hotspots away from the African coast. Furthermore, near-\n\nfield eddies have in general higher lifetime and translation distance than far-field eddies (Figure \n\n4.3 and Annex G.1). On the other hand, far-field eddies are associated with higher values for the \n\neddy translation speed, diameter and amplitude (Figure 4.8, Figure 4.9 and Figure 4.10). These \n\npatterns are very likely associated with the fact that far-field eddies can be found in lower latitudes, \n\nwhich in turn influences such kinematic parameters (further discussed in the following chapter).   \n\nNear-field eddies that are effectively generated by atmospheric effects should follow an \n\nidentical seasonal behaviour as the wind. The prevailing northeast trade winds which affect the \n\narchipelago are under the direct influence of the seasonal migration of the ITCZ (DGA, 2003, \n\nL\u00e1zaro et al., 2005). As such, strong and steady winds are recurrent between December and May, \n\nwhile the remaining months are characterised by low intensity winds (Figure 2.3; Varela-Lopes \n\nand Molion, 2014). Naturally, such seasonal variation must be reflected in the wind stress curl \n\n(Figure 5.1). Dipoles of positive (upwelling) and negative (downwelling) curl appear in the lee of \n\nall the major islands, being spring and winter the seasons with the highest extension and intensity. \n\nThe long-lived near-field eddy origins and trajectories are also represented in Figure 5.1. Most \n\neddies are clearly created during the periods of highest wind intensity \u2013 especially in the leeward \n\nislands, where the wind regime is more constant (DGA, 2003) \u2013 further reinforcing the possibility \n\nthat atmospheric-effects are indeed a key factor in the generation of such features. \n\n\n\n79 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1 \u2013 Seasonal average wind stress curl in Cape Verde Archipelago, overlapped by the long-lived near-field cyclonic (blue) \n\nand anticyclonic (red) eddy trajectories. Circled points represent the place of origin, but only the ones generated in the lee of the \n\nislands have a trajectory.   \n\nPredictably, several very pronounced seasonal EKE signals are present in the immediate \n\nproximity of the leeward islands during spring and winter, though a less intense EKE signal is also \n\nperceivable during autumn (Figure 4.2). One remarkable EKE signal is perfectly depicted \n\nnorthwest of Fogo Island, with a circular and elongated shape in spring and winter, respectively \n\n(Figure 4.2). The almost perfectly circular shape may be evidence of a recurrent eddy generation \n\nsignature in spring, while the elongated shape in winter is very likely to be an evidence of the \n\npreviously described far-field eddy pathway which originates near the Cape Vert promontory. In \n\nfact, part of this far-field eddy pathway seems to merge the elongated EKE signal observed north \n\noff the leeward islands through the Jo\u00e3o Valente Bank (between Boa Vista and Maio Islands, Figure \n\n2.1). Furthermore, the specific case of a far-field eddy interaction with the easternmost islands \n\nreinforces this theory (Figure 4.15 and Figure 4.16). Hence, the combination of an eddy hotspot \n\nand pathway is the most probable designation for the area, which in turn gives rise to the possibility \n\n\n\n80 \n\n \n\nof a major pathway for far-field eddy transformation, merging and splitting. The same can also \n\nresonate for the second remarkable EKE signal perceivable south of the leeward islands during \n\nspring and winter (Figure 4.2), also characterised by a seasonal varying shape. In winter, the other \n\npart of the previously referred far-field eddy pathway merges this EKE signal from the south, which \n\ncan in the same manner represent an important pathway for far-field eddies. However, island-\n\ninduced eddies through atmospheric effects are also strongly associated with this region. Thus, the \n\ninteraction between far-field and near-field eddies and possible island-induced forcing mechanisms \n\nis very likely to occur. In accordance with these findings, L\u00e1zaro et el. (2005) linked the presence \n\nof high EKE values in the lee of Fogo Island to a nearly permanent anticyclonic eddy, which \n\nreached maximum speeds in spring. More recently, Garc\u00eda-Weil et al. (2014) observed a \n\nremarkable EKE signal in the same location while characterising the mesoscale dynamics in the \n\nCanary Islands. Curiously, this signal was significantly more pronounce than in the lee of Canary \n\nIslands, but did not receive any attention.  \n\nIn the current study, the EKE signal downwind of the southernmost islands takes a very \n\ninteresting shape in spring (Figure 4.2). With an initial southwest orientation, turning west in the \n\nfinal segment, this conspicuous structure follows very closely the long-lived anticyclonic eddy \n\ntrajectories evident in Figure 4.17 (and in Annex C.4, where a threshold of 90 days is applied), \n\nwhich in turn resemble with great detail the Canary Eddy Corridor described by Sangr\u00e0 et al. \n\n(2009). The latter authors presented strong evidences that the wind-shadow effect induced by the \n\nCanary Islands plays a key role in the generation of long-lived11 eddies, which initially propagate \n\nsouthward and then deflect westward. Furthermore, the authors also suggested that similar long-\n\nlived eddy corridors could be present in other oceanic regions, referring to the Hawaiian case as an \n\nexample (Calil et al., 2008). Hence, there are strong possibilities that this major near-field long-\n\nlived eddy pathway identified south of Cape Verde can be an important long-lived eddy corridor. \n\nHowever, such assumption requires further investigation.  \n\n  \n\n                                                 \n11 The authors defined a 90 days minimum lifetime threshold for the designation of long-lived eddies.  \n\n\n\n81 \n\n \n\n5.2. Eddy Propagation Characteristics \n\nThroughout the study it has been observed that all long-lived near and far-field eddies \n\npropagate westward, with small meridional deflections along the way (Figure 4.11, Figure 4.12, \n\nFigure 4.17 and Figure 4.18). It has also been observed that the propagation speeds and radius are \n\nhighest at lower latitudes (Figure 4.6d), patterns which have been extensively documented in the \n\npast. The westward propagation speed for long-lived eddies was found to be remarkably close to \n\nthe phase speeds of nondispersive baroclinic Rossby waves (Chaingneau et al., 2009; Chelton et \n\nal., 2011), which in turn increases towards the equator as a function of the planetary vorticity \n\ngradient effect (known as the ?-effect, Cushman-Roisin et al., 1990; Van Leeuwen, 2007). In fact, \n\nit was recently demonstrated that eddies often propagate westward in the crests and troughs of a \n\nplanetary Rossby wave, mostly in lower latitudes (Polito and Sato, 2015). Furthermore, the \n\ninfluence of the local planetary rotation rate on the propagation of an eddy is directly proportional \n\nto the eddy\u2019s diameter (Cushman-Roisin et al., 1990). Hence, the higher the eddy\u2019s size, the higher \n\nthe influence of the ?-effect.  \n\nPresent results also indicate that cyclonic eddies tend to deflect northward, while anticyclonic \n\neddies deflect equatorward (Figure 4.12 and Figure 4.21). This general behaviour has been globally \n\n(Chelton et al., 2011), regionally (Morrow et al., 2004; Chaigneau et al., 2009; Cheng et al., 2014) \n\nand locally (Calil et al., 2008; Sangr\u00e0 et al., 2009) observed in past studies, and is strongly \n\nassociated with the combination of the ?-effect and self-advection by nonlinearity (Chassignet and \n\nCushman-Roisin, 1991; Chelton et al., 2011), in which by the metric of ?/?, ? is the maximum \n\neddy swirl surface velocity and ? is the respective translation speed (Chelton et al., 2011; Sch\u00fctte \n\net al., 2016a). The latter also provides information about the efficiency of an eddy to trap water in \n\nits interior. As such, ?/? > 1 indicates that fluid is advected within its interior and the exchange \n\nof water with the surrounding environment is reduced (Chelton et al., 2011). Although the \n\ncomputation of nonlinearity was considered in the current study, the latter was not possible to \n\ncalculate. An issue regarding the eddy swirl speed \u2013 which the algorithm determines by estimating \n\nthe geostrophic surface current through the SLA dataset (Faghmous et al., 2015a) \u2013 was detected, \n\nas three bands of significantly high values were present in the region, while the remaining areas \n\nwere characterised by values close to 0 (Annex N:). Such behaviour is not possible to occur in the \n\nreal world, since an eddy with null rotational speed would rapidly disintegrate. Several attempts \n\nwere performed in order to solve this issue, but no solution was found.  Nevertheless, Chelton et \n\n\n\n82 \n\n \n\nal. (2011) determined that almost 90% of the long-lived eddies (lifetime ? 16 weeks, or 112 days) \n\nwithin the tropical band (20\u00baS \u2013 20\u00baN) were nonlinear, and all eddies outside this band were highly \n\nnonlinear. Furthermore, Sch\u00fctte et al. (2016a) determined that all eddies (lifetime ? 7 days and \n\nradius ? 45 km) detected in the Cape Verde region were also nonlinear. Thus, considering the \n\nsubstantial similarities between the latter and the current study, it is assumed that all detected \n\nmedium and long-lived far and near-field eddies are nonlinear, and thus it is suggested that the \n\nrespective cyclonic and anticyclonic preference for poleward and equatorward meridional \n\ndeflection is associated with such characteristic.    \n\nThe propagation of mesoscale eddies can still be influenced by many other factors, especially \n\nin an eddying environment such as Cape Verde. The eddy-eddy interaction has been suggested to \n\nhave a substantial influence on the propagations of such features (Calil et al., 2008; Sangr\u00e0 et al., \n\n2009). A remarkable example is observed in the specific case of near-field eddies evolution (Figure \n\n4.23), where the C2 and C3 cyclonic eddies appear to propagate southward in the initial phase, \n\nfollowing the same pattern as the nearby A1 and A2 anticyclonic eddies. As A1 and A2 propagate \n\nfurther away from the C2 and C3, the cyclonic eddies deflect westward and northward before \n\nterminating. Such behaviour in cyclonic eddies was also observed by Lumpkin (1998), where the \n\nadvection by nearby anticyclonic eddies was attributed as the main cause.  \n\nThe background flow in which an eddy propagates can also have important implications. \n\nSangr\u00e0 et al. (2009) suggested that the CC was responsible for the initial southward propagation of \n\nthe anticyclonic eddies forming the Canary Eddy Corridor, which then drifted out of the CC and \n\ndeflected westward as they became large enough for self-advection due to the ?-effect. \n\nFurthermore, it has been demonstrated that the westward Pacific NEC can modify the propagation \n\ncharacteristics of island-induced eddies in the lee of Hawaii (Lumpkin, 2008; Calil et al., 2008), \n\nbeing even able to increase their translation speeds in favourable conditions (Holland and Mitchum, \n\n2001). Considering that eddies generated or modified by the Cape Verde Archipelago propagate in \n\nthe direction of the Atlantic NEC, which has similar characteristics as the Pacific NEC, it is \n\nexpected that the latter can also have an effect in the propagation of such features. Nevertheless, \n\nthis is merely speculative and further investigation should be conducted regarding this issue. \n\nThe wind, besides having an important role on eddy generation, can also influence their \n\npropagation. As previously observed, the area downwind of the leeward islands is marked by an \n\nextensive dipole wind stress curl signal, reaching approximately 12\u00baN (~ 300 km distance from \n\n\n\n83 \n\n \n\nFogo Island) in spring and winter (Figure 5.1). Besides Chavanne et al. (2002), such far-reaching \n\natmospheric effects were documented by Chelton et al. (2004) when revealing the existence of \n\npersistent small-scale features in the global ocean, arguing that these previously unresolved \n\nfeatures could have a substantial impact on the ocean. Curiously, the trajectories within the major \n\nanticyclonic eddy pathway downwind of the leeward islands seem to follow very closely the wind \n\nstress curl bands, especially in the negative (green) wind stress curl area (Figure 5.1). This can be \n\nan indicator of wind-mediated eddy-confinement, first introduced by Coulevard et al. (2012). In an \n\nexceptional novel approach, the latter authors showed strong theoretical evidences that eddies \n\ngenerated by wind shear leeward of Madeira Island were \u201ctrapped\u201d in the wind-wake region, as the \n\ncyclonic and anticyclonic eddies propagated through the positive and negative wind stress curl \n\nbands, respectively. This phenomenon also seems to occur in the lee of Cape Verde, especially \n\nwhen looking at the specific case of the near-field anticyclonic eddies propagation plotted against \n\nthe wind stress curl (Annex P.1). The A1 and A2 anticyclonic eddies propagate south-westward \n\nfollowing the same orientation as the negative wind stress curl (green), while the C2 and C3 \n\ncyclonic eddies show a different behaviour, which is very likely related with the interaction with \n\nA1 and A2 (discussed earlier). Therefore, it is strongly suggested that the wind-wake may be an \n\nimportant contributor to the containment of the oceanic eddies in the lee of Cape Verde \n\nArchipelago.  \n\n5.3. Far-Field Eddy-Island Interaction  \n\nThe eddy propagation in the ocean is directly affected by topography, as the trajectory and \n\nstructure of such features is prone to modifications driven by the interaction with a continental \n\nslope, a seamount or an island (Yang et al., 2016). As previously discussed, many of the eddies \n\ngenerated at the African coast often intersect the archipelago while propagating westward to \n\noffshore waters. Such eddies have recently been subject of numerous studies, in which the \n\nhydrographic (Sch\u00fctte et al., 2016a) and biogeochemical (Fischer et al., 2016; Fiedler et al., 2016; \n\nHauss et al., 2016; Karstensen et al., 2015; L\u00f6scher et al., 2015; Sch\u00fctte et al., 2016b; Romero et \n\nal., 2016) properties were extensively characterised. However, the implications of the interaction \n\nof such features with the Cape Verde Archipelago has, to present date, received no attention. To \n\ncurrent knowledge, most studies regarding the eddy-island interaction were conducted under \n\nlaboratory (e.g., Cenedese, 2002; Adduce and Cenedese, 2004; Cenedese et al., 2005; Tanabe and \n\n\n\n84 \n\n \n\nCenedese, 2008; Andres and Cenedese, 2013) and model (e.g., Simmons and Nof, 2000; 2002; \n\nStern, 2000) experiments, but empirical case studies are extremely rare (Chang et al., 2012). In an \n\nidealized case, Stern (2000) was able to simulate the splitting of an eddy when colliding with an \n\nisland, a phenomenon which is believed to result in the transfer of energy, momentum, salinity and \n\ntemperature to the surrounding environment through small, dissipative scales (Simmons and Nof, \n\n2000, Cenedese et al., 2005). More recently, Chang et al. (2012) described the collision between \n\ntwo anticyclonic eddies with Dongsha atoll, which resulted in the weakening/termination of the \n\nstronger eddy and in the splitting of the weaker one. Nonetheless, Yang et al. (2016) argues that \n\nthe phenomenon of eddy-splitting \u2013 such as the one previously reported by Chang et al. (2012) \u2013 \n\nlacks sufficient observational data to systematically describe such process, and suggests that further \n\nempirical investigation must be conducted to better comprehend such phenomenon.  \n\nFrom the previously observed far-field eddy trajectories (Figure 4.11), the Cape Verde \n\nArchipelago appears to act as an extremely effective barrier, as no far-field eddy trajectory is \n\nobserved to overcome the islands. From these results, one may deceptively assume that all far-field \n\neddies terminate when intersecting the archipelago. However, this is far from reality. From the \n\nanalysis of the supplementary material, it is observed that most of these eddies undergo through \n\ncomplex transformation processes which give rise to (supposedly) new eddies in the opposite side. \n\nThus, the most accurate way of perceiving such results is by assuming that no long-lived far-field \n\neddy is able to keep its original form and kinematic properties when intersecting the archipelago. \n\nFrom the visual analysis of the sequential SLA maps and eddy trajectories (supplementary \n\nmaterial), it was possible to determine that, for a total number of 74 long-lived far-field eddies: 45 \n\n(61 %) were terminated without interacting directly with the islands; 13 (18 %) underwent a \n\ntransformation process which made the eddy tracking algorithm to falsely identify such features as \n\nnewly-generated eddies; 7 (9 %) were destructed without leaving a trail; 5 (7 %) resulted in eddy \n\nsplitting, giving rise to 11 new near-field eddies; and 4 (5 %) were deflected and kept propagating \n\nin a different direction. Some specific cases of such interaction were selected, where the \n\ntransformation of two anticyclonic eddies and the splitting of one cyclonic eddy are presented \n\n(Figure 4.15 and Figure 4.16).  \n\nThe case of the A2 far-field eddy is quite interesting. As the anticyclonic eddy intersects the \n\nwindward islands from the northeast, another eddy of the same polarity forms on the opposite side. \n\nConsequently, a streamer appears to detach from the impinging A2 eddy and flows \n\n\n\n85 \n\n \n\ncounterclockwise around the islands, joining the body of the newly generated A4 eddy. However, \n\nit has been observed in laboratory experiments that, as a streamer detaches from the eddy when \n\nintersecting an island, it flows along the island\u2019s perimeter in the same direction as the eddy\u2019s flow \n\n(Andres and Cenedese, 2013). This means that, as an anticyclonic eddy rotates in the clockwise \n\ndirection, it is expected that the resulting streamer flows around the island in the same clockwise \n\ndirection. Hence, the specific case of A2 is contradictory to past studies.  \n\nNevertheless, one most consider that this is far from an idealized case, as several other factors \n\ncan influence such interaction. After a detailed analysis of the sequential SLA maps (supplementary \n\nmaterial), a new hypothesis arises: The A4 is very likely to be a result of the atmospheric or oceanic \n\nshedding effects induced by the windward islands, as early signs of formation emerge before the \n\nA2 interaction with the islands. If this is the case, part of the impinging A2 far-field eddy merges \n\nthe newly generate A4 eddy \u2013 a recurrent phenomenon between anticyclonic eddies (Cushman-\n\nRoisin et al.,1990) \u2013 giving the false impression that the A4 is a direct result of the A2 eddy-island \n\ninteraction, though it may also be an important factor. As a cautionary note, such assumption should \n\nbe regarded as speculative and \u2013 as Dong and McWilliams (2007) suggested \u2013 further studies \n\nshould be conducted to better understand the physical processes occurring in a real oceanic island \n\nwake and thus better comprehend the implications of far-field eddies in the generation of island-\n\ninduced eddies.  \n\n Another interesting case occurred approximately at the same location. The A3 anticyclonic \n\nfar-field eddy approaches the windward islands and is considered terminated by the tracking \n\nalgorithm after intersecting Santo Ant\u00e3o, though most of the SLA body remains present. It is very \n\nlikely that the latter is related with the consequent modification of shape and associated kinematic \n\nproperties. The A6 anticyclonic eddy arises a few kilometres southwest, which is undoubtedly a \n\nproduct of the A3 eddy-island interaction. In fact, the most appropriate designation of such feature \n\nshould be A3.1. The cases of A2 (former) and A3 (latter) are very likely to be a recurrent \n\nphenomenon in the windward region, as a very pronounced EKE signal is observed exactly in the \n\nsame location, especially in spring and summer (Figure 4.2), Hence, it is possible that the very \n\npronounced eddy hotspot observed in the lee of Santo Ant\u00e3o (Figure 4.4c and 4.4d) might be a \n\ncombination of island-induced eddies and the transformation of far-field incoming eddies.  \n\n However, the most remarkable eddy-island interaction case is associated with the C1 far-field \n\ncyclonic eddy which arises north of the Cape Vert promontory, along with the A5 anticyclonic \n\n\n\n86 \n\n \n\neddy. In contrast with A5 \u2013 which is deflected southward and terminates before intersecting the \n\narchipelago \u2013 C1 intersects the easternmost islands. Consequently, the eddy perimeter interacts \n\nwith Boa Vista Island, drastically changing the propagation speed and trajectory of the latter \u2013 a \n\nbehaviour which is consistent with past studies. Yang et al. (2016) demonstrated that the \n\ntopographic effects on an eddy were felt at some distance away from an obstacle, which lead to a \n\nnotable change in the eddy propagation. The latter was also observed by Chang et al. (2012), as an \n\nanticyclonic eddy weakened at a 30-120 km distance from the Dongsha atoll.  \n\nIt is worth mentioning that the Cape Verde Archipelago is constituted by 2 main chains of \n\nislands with relatively shallow depths between them (except between Fogo and Santiago Islands, \n\nFigure 2.1). Such geomorphological disposition may lead the easternmost islands to act as a single \n\nattached edifice, obstructing the westward propagation of incoming eddies. The latter seems to be \n\nthe case for C1, as the eddy is deflected southward when intersecting the Jo\u00e3o Valente bank \n\nbetween Boa Vista and Maio Islands (Ramalho, 2011) \u2013 a behaviour that was also observed in an \n\nidealised case (Andres and Cenedese, 2013). As the eddy stays approximately stationary, a streamer \n\ndetaches from the eddy flowing in the counterclockwise direction along the northern side of the \n\nleeward islands, giving rise to the cyclonic eddy C2. According to Andres and Cenedese (2013), \n\nthis kind of streamers are governed by the conservation of circulation momentum around the \n\nislands, which in turn results in a jet-like current between the island passage and the generation of \n\nother eddies downstream (Cenedese et al., 2005).  \n\nAs C2 increases in amplitude and size, a streamer is peeled off from the eddy, originating \n\nanother cyclonic eddy southwest of Fogo Island (C3). Nevertheless, and following the same \n\nhypothesis as the previously discussed A4, the generation of C3 can also be influenced by \n\natmospheric island-induced disturbances, since it occurs during the period of highest wind intensity \n\n(DGA, 2003; Varela-Lopes and Molion, 2014) at a location where positive wind stress curl \n\n(strongly associated with cyclonic eddies, Chavanne et al., 2002) is often very pronounced (Figure \n\n5.2). While strong evidences suggest that C2 is a direct product of the C1 intersection with the \n\nislands, it is likely that C3 arises from interaction of C2 with Fogo Island, which in turn is \n\nintensified by the wind shear effect provoked by same island. If this is in fact the case, this \n\nphenomenon further reinforces the idea that near-field eddy generation in Cape Verde is a rather \n\ncomplex phenomenon, which deserves special attention and should be regarded with caution \u2013 as \n\na variety of factors, never documented elsewhere, are at work. \n\n\n\n87 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2 \u2013 Representation of the specific C3 eddy generation, plotted against wind stress curl (averaged from 8 days prior to \n\nrespective date). Black square represents CV area. Doted and solid lines represent active and terminated eddy tracks, respectively. \n\n5.4. Biological Implications \n\nThe enhancement of biological primary production \u2013 especially phytoplankton \u2013 is largely \n\nassociated with the supply of nutrients into the euphotic zone (Ar\u00edstegui et al., 2007). According \n\nto past studies, such nutrient availability in the region is mostly regulated by 3 mechanisms. First, \n\nthe seasonal coastal upwelling in the western African coast stimulates phytoplankton growth \n\n(Figure 4.24, Demarcq and Samoue, 2015), which sometimes reaches the Cape Verde Archipelago \n\nthrough ocean current or filament advection (Figure 4.25, Fernandes et al., 2005; Lathuili\u00e8re et al., \n\n2008). In fact, it has been estimated that half of the total upwelled water between 17-23\u00baN flows \n\nacross the upwelling front in filaments (Kostianoy and Zatsepin, 1996). Second, atmospheric \n\ndeposition of iron-rich Saharan dust can intensify phytoplankton growth, though with less \n\npronounced implications (Lange et al., 1998; Pradhan et al., 2006; Ohde and Siegel, 2010; Fischer \n\net al., 2016). Finally, nutrient injection (advection) induced by cyclonic (anticyclonic) coastal-\n\ngenerated eddies can sustain enhanced levels of Chla at its core, transporting such unique \n\n\n\n88 \n\n \n\nenvironments (Alpers et al., 2013, Fischer et al., 2015; L\u00f6scher et al., 2015; Karstensen et al., \n\n2015) and possibly impacting the archipelago in their transition to offshore waters. All these \n\ndistinct mechanisms have one thing in common \u2013 the place of origin. Hence, their implication to \n\nthe archipelago can be regarded as remote (far-field) biological enrichment. Notwithstanding, a \n\nnew driving mechanism \u2013 which to present date has only been hypothesized in the region \u2013 is \n\nproposed: the island-induced biological enhancement through eddy-induced Ekman suction of \n\ndeep nutrient-rich water to surface layers, a phenomenon often linked to the IME (Caldeira et al., \n\n2002). However, IME has often been regarded as an isolated mechanism, exclusively induced by \n\nthe islands on the local environment (Gove et al., 2016). The present study challenges this idea, as \n\nthe combination of both remote and local mechanisms is the most accurate way of characterising \n\nthe archipelago\u2019s biological realm.  \n\nThe representation of surface Chla concentration in two specific periods of time substantially \n\nsupports this theory (Figure 4.26 and Figure 4.27). The main objective was to characterise isolated \n\ncases of remote and local enrichment, though it was virtually not possible since both mechanisms \n\nare detected in both periods and appear to work simultaneously. Nevertheless, some isolated \n\nfeatures were identified, as it is the case of a large Chla patch which detaches from the extensively \n\nstudied \u201cgiant filament\u201d of Cape Blanc (Figure 4.26). Despite the non-identification of an eddy by \n\nthe tracking algorithm and the difficulty in assessing the structure\u2019s nature with the ocean currents \n\nrepresentation (Annex M.1), L\u00f6scher et al. (2015) demonstrated that this feature was in fact an \n\nanticyclonic eddy, characterised by high Chla concentrations at the surface and abnormally low \n\ndissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations at near-surface layers. The eddy then intersected the \n\narchipelago and a significant increase in Chla concentration emerged in its vicinity. Another similar \n\ncase is observed in Figure 4.27. The tracking algorithm identified this feature as an anticyclonic \n\neddy generated near the Mauritanian coast, though its trajectory was interrupted as it propagated \n\nwestward (Figure 5.3) \u2013 most likely due to eddy pulsation, as suggested by Sangr\u00e0 et al. (2005). \n\nFollowing its trajectory, the eddy is diverted slightly to north as it interacts with the windward \n\nislands and continues propagating west. This anticyclonic eddy was documented by Karstensen et \n\nal. (2015), who also detected severe hypoxic conditions (20 \u00b5mol.kg?1) at the ~120-m depth when \n\nit intersected the Cape Verde Ocean Observatory mooring, north of the leeward islands. Such DO \n\ndepleted eddies are now thought to be recurrent in the region, and are very likely related with \n\n\n\n89 \n\n \n\nphytoplankton blooms and subsequent sinking of detritus, which induces oxygen consumption at \n\ndeeper layers (Karstensen et al., 2015; Ficher et al., 2016; Hauss et al., 2016).  \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3 \u2013 Surface Chla concentration in January, along with the respective anticyclonic (red) and cyclonic (light blue) trajectories. \n\nDoted area represents eddies perimeter.   \n\nConsidering the nature of the previous anticyclonic far-field eddies, it is expected that the \n\nenhanced Chla concentrations were most likely advected from the highly productive coastal area, \n\nsince such features are not able to self-inject deep nutrient-rich water to the surface. On the \n\ncontrary, the observed decrease in Chla concentration is likely related with the deepening of the \n\nmixed layer by the downward self-induced Ekman-pumping mechanism (e.g., Sangr\u00e0 et al., 2009), \n\nalong with the phytoplankton\u2019s nutrient-consumption and consequent depletion, and possible \n\ngrazing by zooplankters (Hern\u00e1ndez-Le\u00f3n, 1991). Nonetheless, it has been documented that \n\nanticyclonic eddies have the potential to retain and support planktonic communities over many \n\ngenerations, being thus able to enhance larval survival for many invertebrate and fish species \n\n(Condie and Condie, 2016). Such finding implies that far-field eddies approaching the Cape Verde \n\nArchipelago might be a great medium for biological transportation, connecting this presumably \n\nisolated group of islands to the western African coast.  \n\n\n\n90 \n\n \n\nA very interesting case is the small patch of high Chla values observed in February 2014 (circle \n\nin red, Figure 4.26). Although no eddy could be associated with this feature, it is reasonable to \n\nassume that such occurrence might be associated with a localised vertical advection of nutrients \n\ninduced by a cyclonic eddy (Gaube et al., 2013), since this region is remote and considered \n\noligotrophic (Alpers et al., 2013; L\u00f6scher et al., 2015, Fiedler et al., 2016). Nevertheless, the lack \n\nof evidences hinders the association of such phenomenon to an island-induced mechanism. This \n\nkind of phenomenon has been documented in a variety of studies. In an idealized case study, L\u00e9vy \n\net al. (2001) showed that sub-mesoscale physics associated with cyclonic eddies are responsible \n\nfor more than 1/3 of the new production of phytoplankton in an oligotrophic regime, due to the \n\nincrease of nutrient transport from the deeper layers within the surface layers. Similarly, Lin et al. \n\n(2010) investigated an unusual phytoplankton bloom in the south of China and suggested that the \n\nupward advection mechanisms associated with an observed cyclonic eddy were the main cause, \n\nfurther reinforcing current findings. \n\nThe most remarkable observation, however, is undoubtedly associated with the phytoplankton \n\nbloom southwest of Fogo Island in January 2010 (Figure 4.27 and Figure 5.3). Despite the localised \n\nand punctual nature of this phenomenon, this bloom is almost certainly associated with a far-field \n\ncyclonic eddy that approaches the windward islands from southeast (Figure 5.3). The iron-\n\nenrichment through island runoff was also considered, but since the bloom takes place in the dry \n\nseason (DGA, 2003), such driving mechanism is unlikely to occur. The eddy\u2019s trajectory is \n\ninterrupted as it interacts with a nearby anticyclonic eddy (supplementary material), but as soon as \n\nthe latter moves away, the cyclonic eddy is reactivated and substantially intensified as it remains \n\napproximately stationary in the wake of Fogo Island, giving rise to a very pronounced Chla signal. \n\nThe eddy intensification may by driven by the input of energy induced by the wind in the lee of the \n\nisland. Such occurrence has been documented in the lee of Hawaii, as Calil et al. (2008) observed \n\nthe weakening and intensification of a cyclonic eddy as a causative effect induced by the wind. \n\nFurthermore, it is reasonable to expect that this mechanism can significantly stimulate \n\nphytoplankton growth at the surface, given the substantial amount of studies that demonstrated \n\nsuch phenomenon. In an idealized case, Hasegawa et al. (2009) investigated the development of \n\nphytoplankton blooms in the wake of an island and found that the upwelling of nutrients \u2013 \n\nespecially nitrate \u2013 provoked by island-induced cyclonic eddies was a key factor. \n\n\n\n91 \n\n \n\nSuch findings have also been extensively reported in the Macaronesia islands, mainly in \n\nMadeira and Canary Islands, but never has this phenomenon been documented in the Cape Verde \n\nArchipelago. Using remote sensing tools and historical data, Caldeira et al. (2002) documented \n\nseveral episodes of sub-mesoscale cyclonic eddies generated in the western flanks of Madeira \n\nIsland, accompanied by enhanced levels of Chla at the centre. Further studies conducted in the \n\nsame region were able to replicate similar observations (Caldeira and Sangr\u00e0, 2012, Caldeira et al., \n\n2014), further reinforcing the idea that this is a recurrent phenomenon. In Canary Islands, \n\nHernandez-Leon, (1991) first documented the accumulation of mesozooplankton in the wake of \n\nGran Canaria Island as a causative mechanism of the IME, but only until later could the enhanced \n\nChla surface concentrations \u2013 found in the wake of the islands \u2013 be associated with nutrient-\n\nenrichment driven by island-induced cyclonic eddies (Aristegui et al., 1997, Basterretxea et al., \n\n2002). In the Azores, however, Caldeira and Jesus (2017) suggested that the ability of the islands \n\nto retain the incoming properties from the impinging flow was the main cause for the observed \n\nnutrient and/or biological local enrichment, being thus the remote enrichment though far-field \n\nfeatures the principal driving mechanism for biological productivity in the archipelago. \n\nConsidering the substantial amount of evidences presented here, it is therefore proposed that \n\nthe exposure of the Cape Verde Archipelago to far-field eddies and consequent remote-enrichment, \n\ncombined with the ability to self-generate eddies and consequently enhance local biological \n\nproductivity, are the main factors driving the local primary production. Nevertheless, more detailed \n\ninvestigation must be conducted in order to better comprehend and quantify the relation between \n\nthe near and the far-field affecting the archipelago.   \n\n\n\n92 \n\n \n\n6. Conclusions \n\nThe current study focused on the regional and local characterisation of the oceanic processes \n\nwhich affect and are generated by the Cape Verde Archipelago, giving especial attention to the \n\nhighly complex far-field and near-field mesoscale eddies, respectively. Although many studies \n\nhave investigated the mechanisms and implications associated with eddy generation in the lee of \n\nislands, very few have considered the implications of far-field features in such near-field processes. \n\nIn that sense, this study distinguishes from past studies in a very important way. As such, direct \n\ncomparisons with other observations were always regarded with extreme caution.  \n\nIn accordance with existing knowledge, current results have consistently demonstrated that the \n\narchipelago sits in a rather complex oceanic region, highly constrained by the atmospheric \n\ndynamics induced by the seasonal behaviour of the ITCZ. Such patterns regulate several large-\n\nscale processes, as it is the case of the oceanic surface currents and the upwelling system off the \n\nwestern African coast. Naturally, similar patterns are reflected at a local scale. In fact, it was \n\nobserved that the wind punctual and seasonal behaviour can induce significant disturbances in the \n\nlee of the islands, followed by localised oceanic responses in the form of eddies. Several very \n\npronounced medium and long-lived eddy hotspots were detected in the lee of the major islands of \n\nthe Cape Verde Archipelago. Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that the archipelago is exposed to \n\na remarkable number of far-field eddies, which interact with the islands and consequent island-\n\ninduced processes. These far-field eddies are mostly generated in the western African coast in \n\nsummer and autumn and are likely associated with the intensification of the MC. As they propagate \n\nwestward, they intersect the archipelago between winter and spring, which also coincides with the \n\nperiods of highest wind intensity and near-field eddy generation. This kind of interaction brings \n\nconsiderable implications not only for the near-field eddies, but also to the propagation and \n\nevolution of the far-field eddies. In that sense, it was observed that the far-field eddy-island \n\ninteraction resulted in four different outcomes. The most recurrent scenario was eddy \n\ntransformation, which made the eddy tracking algorithm to falsely identify transformed eddies as \n\nnewly-generated near-field eddies. The second most often observed scenario was associated with \n\neddy termination. Subsequently, eddy splitting was the third most observed scenario, which \n\nresulted in the termination of the impinging eddy and in the generation of several other near-field \n\neddies. Finally, it was also observed that topographic effects induced by the islands can divert \n\neddies and consequently change their propagation characteristics.  \n\n\n\n93 \n\n \n\nConsidering the substantial amount of evidences that support the systematic occurrence of far-\n\nfield eddy-island interactions, one may conclude that many near-field eddies are a direct product \n\nor by-product of such interaction. For this reason, it is very difficult to determine the nature of the \n\neddies being generated in the archipelago, i.e. from island-induced mechanisms, far-field eddy-\n\nisland interaction or even far-field \u2013 near-field eddy interaction. As such, it is demonstrated that \n\nthe combination of near and far-field processes are the main causes in the generation of mesoscale \n\neddies in the archipelago, making Cape Verde a perfect location for the study of such interaction. \n\nAssuming that most medium and long-lived eddies in the region are very likely to be nonlinear \n\n(Chelton et al., 2011; Sch\u00fctte et al., 2016a), it is suggested that the interactions between incoming \n\nfar-field eddies and the archipelago can also have important implications in the local biological \n\nrealm. In fact, several far-field eddies (October 2009 \u2013 January 2010 and October 2013 \u2013 December \n\n2013) have been observed to transport Chla-rich water in the direction of Cape Verde, enhancing \n\nChla concentrations in its vicinity. Nevertheless, island-induced processes can also favour local \n\nbiological productivity, as it was the case of a remarkable Chla signal (January 2010) strongly \n\nassociated with the self-induced nutrient injection provoked by a cyclonic eddy. Curiously, this \n\neddy was generated away from the islands, but further observations suggest that the latter was \n\nintensified by island-induced mechanisms (probably wind-shear effects) as it approached Fogo \n\nIsland from the southwest, giving rise to a sudden phytoplankton bloom.  This is another perfect \n\nexample of the interaction between the far and the near-field, further reinforcing the idea that both \n\nfields are intertwined in such a way that hinders the distinction and quantification of individual \n\nmechanisms. It also challenges the idea that the IME is a phenomenon exclusively induced by an \n\nisland (or group of islands), being thus proposed that IME can in fact be developed and sustained \n\nby the combination and interaction of local and remote processes. \n\nOne last note is regarded towards the efficiency of the eddy detection and tracking algorithm \n\nbeing used (Faghmous et al., 2015a). It was possible to determine that a considerable number of \n\neddy trajectories were prematurely interrupted and restarted as false newly-generated eddies \n\n(suplementary material). Such occurrence poses significant limitations and implications for the \n\ncurrent study, in the sense that the estimated lifetime and propagation extension of some eddies \n\nmay be inaccurate, which in turn can compromise the determination and characterisation of certain \n\neddy hotspots \u2013 mainly in the western African coastal area \u2013, as well as the number of far-field \n\neddies intersecting CV. Taking into account past and recent literature regarding mesoscale \n\n\n\n94 \n\n \n\nvariability in the western African coast, it is expected that a larger number of far-field eddies \u2013 \n\nmainly originating near the Cape Vert and Cape Blanc headlands \u2013 would intersect the archipelago, \n\nbut only a few cases are detected. Because of the premature termination of eddies, many of these \n\ntrajectories do not reach the CV area, though their SLA signal is still observed to go beyond the \n\neastern CV area delimitation (supplementary material), often being designated as (false) newly-\n\ngenerated near-field eddies as they are reactivated inside CV.  Therefore, it is very likely that the \n\nnumber of far-field eddies interacting with the archipelago is underestimated, while the number of \n\nnear-field eddies is conversely overestimated. Furthermore, the real implications of the near-field \n\neddies at a regional scale are very likely to be underestimated. This is supported by the fact that \n\nvery few near-field eddy trajectories are observed to reach longitudes farther than 35\u00baW, though in \n\nthe sequential representations of the SLA field and eddies trajectories (supplementary material), \n\nmany prematurely terminated near-field eddies often do. Such results demonstrate that, despite the \n\nconsiderable advances in eddy identification and tracking procedures, it is still necessary to \n\nimprove current methods in order to better comprehend the physical mechanisms and real \n\nimplications that such features represent to regional and local oceanography.    \n\nSummarizing the final conclusions of the study, the two initially proposed hypotheses are \n\nassessed. Can far-field features have considerable implications on oceanic islands and associated \n\nphysical/biological processes, that have been neglected to present date? The answer is yes. Current \n\nresults show that, despite being at ~ 600 km distance from the nearest coastal area, the interaction \n\nof far-field eddies with Cape Verde Archipelago is a recurrent phenomenon, which often hinders \n\nthe distinction between local and remote-induced processes. Hence, to what extend can islands \n\nimpact such far-field features? The impacts are quite remarkable. Results show that far-field eddies \n\nare always transformed when interacting with the archipelago, giving origin to new eddies through \n\nsplitting, deflecting their trajectories or even terminating their existence.  \n\nNotwithstanding, new hypotheses emerged along the study: can the archipelago induce \n\nsignificant regional implications in the ocean, such as a long-lived eddy corridor or a zonal basin-\n\nwide countercurrent? Although the strong likelihood, further investigation must be conducted to \n\nfully elucidate such possibilities. Thus, this is proposed to be the starting point for futures studies.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n95 \n\n \n\nReferences  \n\nAdduce, C. and Cenedese, C. (2004).
