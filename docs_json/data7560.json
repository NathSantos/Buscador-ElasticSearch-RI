In this context, \n\nvegetable oils and saccharides are interesting raw materials that can be \n\napplied as chemical platforms in the synthesis of novel fully renewable \n\nmonomers through chemical modification. In addition, thiol-ene \n\npolymerization has been shown as a versatile tool to produce polymers \n\nfrom fully renewable ?,?-diene monomers bearing, for example ester, \n\nether, or amide functional groups in the backbone chain. However, \n\nworks portraying the polymerization of renewable monomers through \n\nthiol-ene polymerization in dispersed medium are still uncommon. \n\nHerein, it is presented the synthesis and characterisation of \n\npoly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles via thiol-ene polymerization in \n\nminiemulsion using a monomer derived from renewable resources. The \n\nsynthesis of a renewable ?,?-diene diester monomer, dianhydro-D-\n\nglucityl diundec-10-enoate (DGU), produced from 10-undecenoic acid \n\n(derived from castor oil) and isosorbide (derived from starch) was \n\nperformed. DGU was copolymerized with 1,4-butanedithiol (Bu(SH)2) \n\nthrough thiol-ene polymerization both in bulk and miniemulsion to yield \n\nlinear semi-crystalline poly(thioether-ester)s. Different parameters were \n\nevaluated such as reaction temperature, initiator concentration, \n\nsurfactant type and surfactant concentration. Particle size distribution \n\nand morphology was observed by DLS and TEM respectively resulting \n\nin spherical particles with an intensity average particle diameter around \n\n200 nm. Polymer with higher molecular weight was obtained by \n\nminiemulsion polymerization when compared to bulk polymerization. \n\nNumber average molecular weight of 11 kDa was obtained through \n\nminiemulsion polymerization at 80\u00b0C for 4h using AIBN at 1 mol% (in \n\nrelation to Bu(SH)2). Furthermore, DSC and XRD analyses have shown \n\nthat the synthesized polymer was semi-crystalline with a degree of \n\ncrystallinity above 20% and Tm around 60\u00b0C. Finally, depending on the \n\nco-stabilizer type, hexadecane or Crodamol, and amount, phase \n\nsegregation within polymer particles was observed through DSC. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Thiol-ene polymerization in miniemulsion.

Materiais \n\npolim\u00e9ricos obtidos de mon\u00f4meros derivados de fontes renov\u00e1veis s\u00e3o \n\numa alternativa ambientalmente correta aos pol\u00edmeros derivados do \n\npetr\u00f3leo, especialmente para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es de alto valor agregado. Neste \n\ncontexto, \u00f3leos vegetais e sacar\u00eddeos s\u00e3o mat\u00e9rias-primas interessantes \n\nque podem ser utilizadas como plataformas qu\u00edmicas para a s\u00edntese de \n\nnovos mon\u00f4meros, completamente renov\u00e1veis, atrav\u00e9s da modifica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nqu\u00edmica. Al\u00e9m disso, polimeriza\u00e7\u00e3o tiol-eno mostrou-se uma vers\u00e1til \n\nferramenta para a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de pol\u00edmeros a partir de mon\u00f4meros verdes \n\n(?,?-dienos) providos de grupos funcionais como \u00e9ster, \u00e9ter ou amida na \n\ncadeia principal. Entretanto, trabalhos sobre a polimeriza\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nmon\u00f4meros renov\u00e1veis atrav\u00e9s da polimeriza\u00e7\u00e3o tiol-eno em meios \n\ndispersos ainda s\u00e3o escassos. Neste trabalho, a s\u00edntese e a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde nanopart\u00edculas de poli(tio\u00e9ter-\u00e9ster) via polimeriza\u00e7\u00e3o tiol-eno em \n\nminiemuls\u00e3o usando um mon\u00f4mero proveniente de fontes renov\u00e1veis \n\ns\u00e3o apresentadas. O mon\u00f4mero verde utilizado \u00e9 um ?,?-dieno di\u00e9ster, \n\ndiundec-10-enoato de dianidro-D-glucitila (DGU), produzido a partir de \n\n\u00e1cido 10-undecen\u00f3ico (derivado do \u00f3leo de mamona) e isosorb\u00eddeo \n\n(derivado do amido). DGU foi copolimerizado com 1,4-butanoditiol \n\n(Bu(SH)2) atrav\u00e9s polimeriza\u00e7\u00e3o tiol-eno em massa e em miniemuls\u00e3o \n\npara produzir poli(tio\u00e9ter-\u00e9ster) linear e semicristalino. Diferentes \n\npar\u00e2metros foram avaliados, como por exemplo temperatura, \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o de iniciador, tipo e concentra\u00e7\u00e3o do surfactante. A \n\ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o de tamanho e a morfologia das part\u00edculas foram observadas \n\npor DLS e TEM respectivamente, revelando part\u00edculas esf\u00e9ricas com \n\ndi\u00e2metro de 200 nm. O pol\u00edmero obtido pela polimeriza\u00e7\u00e3o em \n\nminiemuls\u00e3o, 11 kDa onde as condi\u00e7\u00f5es reacionais foram 80\u00b0C por 4h \n\nusando 1 mol% de AIBN (em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao Bu(SH)2), mostrou-se com \n\nmaior massa molar em compara\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0quele obtido em polimeriza\u00e7\u00e3o em \n\nmassa. An\u00e1lises de DSC e DRX mostraram que o pol\u00edmero sintetizado \u00e9 \n\nsemicristalino com grau de cristalinidade de pelo menos 20% e Tm em \n\ntorno de 60\u00b0C. Dependendo do tipo de co-estabilizador utilizado, \n\nhexadecano ou Crodamol, e da quantidade, pode-se observar por DSC \n\nsegrega\u00e7\u00e3o de fases nas part\u00edculas polim\u00e9ricas. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Polimeriza\u00e7\u00e3o tiol-eno em miniemuls\u00e3o.

Therefore, in the past few decades, sustainable efforts \n\nhave been extensively devoted to prepare new polymers from renewable \n\nenvironmentally friendly raw materials. In this context, fatty acids from \n\nvegetable oils and saccharides, or sugars, stand out as highly convenient \n\nraw materials because they are both abundant worldwide, inexpensive, \n\nprovide stereochemical diversity and can potentially yield biocompatible \n\nand biodegradable materials (MEIER; METZGER; SCHUBERT, 2007; \n\nBELGACEM; GANDINI, 2008).  \n\nHowever, polymerization attempts of vegetable oils, which are \n\nmultifunctional monomers, usually ended up with the synthesis of cross-\n\nlinked polymers. Vegetable oils are usually copolymerized to non-\n\nrenewable monomers such as styrene (LU; LAROCK, 2010; MEIORIN; \n\nARANGUREN; MOSIEWICKI, 2012), divinylbenzene, norbonadiene, \n\nand acrylates (LU; LAROCK, 2009, 2010) to achieve the required \n\nthermal and mechanical properties. On the other hand, they are \n\npromising platforms for the synthesis of novel monomers by chemical \n\nmodification. Vegetable oils are mainly composed by triglycerides, \n\nwhich in its turn possess several reaction sites within the molecule such \n\nas the acyl group, double bonds and even hydroxyls that can undergo \n\nchemical modifications to yield a vast variety of monomeric molecules \n\n(MUTLU, 2012; VILELA; SILVESTRE; MEIER, 2012). By designing \n\nthe monomer using vegetable oils, or other biofeedstocks such as sugars, \n\nas chemical platform, it is possible to include in the polymer molecule \n\nfunctional groups or even chemical bonds that facilitate biodegradation. \n\nFor example, the inclusion of strategically positioned grafts in the \n\npolymeric back-bone that could enable the enzymes to attach more \n\neasily to the substrate binding site or the inclusion of disulphide bonds \n\nin the polymer\u2018s main chain. \n\nThiol-ene reactions are often considered as either click or green \n\nchemistry reactions because they can be carried out at mild conditions, \n\nnormally achieve high conversion and do not generate any \n\nenvironmentally hazardous by-products (HOYLE; LEE; ROPER, 2004; \n\nHOYLE; BOWMAN, 2010; CLAUDINO, 2011). Thiol-ene reactions \n\nhave been extensively utilized for surface and molecules \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nfunctionalization (FEIDENHANS\u2018L et al., 2014; CHEN et al., 2015; \n\nIONESCU et al., 2015; KUHLMANN et al., 2015), molecules \n\nconjugation (STENZEL, 2013; KUHLMANN et al., 2015), crosslinking \n(ACOSTA ORTIZ et al., 2010; WANG et al., 2013), grafting (KOLB; \n\nMEIER, 2013), UV-curable coatings (BLACK; RAWLINS, 2009; \n\nSANGERMANO et al., 2009; \u00c7AKMAK\u00c7I et al., 2012) and \npolymerization of renewable monomers (KREYE; T\u00d3TH; MEIER, \n\n2011; T\u00dcR\u00dcN\u00c7 et al., 2012; KOLB; MEIER, 2013; T\u00dcR\u00dcN\u00c7; \nMEIER, 2013; YOSHIMURA et al., 2015). \n\nThiol-ene polymerization possess a step-growth mechanism \n\nthrough free-radical reactions. A reaction between monofunctional ene \n\nand thiol molecules leads to adducts. Difunctional monomers \n\npolymerize to yield linear polymers, whilst multifunctional monomers \n\nform a polymeric network (CRAMER et al., 2003). Most of the work \nfound in the literature portrays cross-linked thiol-ene polymers, such as \n\nhydrogels and resins, to use in diverse applications that range from \n\nphotocurable coatings (BLACK; RAWLINS, 2009; CARLBORG et al., \n\n2014) to biomedical (KI et al., 2014; LIN; KI; SHIH, 2015). Recently, \n\nlinear thiol-ene polymers have been utilized to synthesize nano- and \n\nmicroparticles through heterogeneous phase polymerization \n\ntechniques (DURHAM; SHIPP, 2014; JASINSKI et al., 2014a; LOBRY \net al., 2014; AMATO et al., 2015).  \n\nMoreover, thiol-ene polymerization has been shown as a versatile \n\ntool to produce polymers from fully renewable ?,?-diene monomers \n\nbearing, for example ester, ether, or amide functional groups in the main \n\nchain (T\u00dcR\u00dcN\u00c7; MEIER, 2013). Some of these moieties, such as ester \n\nfunctionality, are interesting because they can be readily hydrolysed and \n\ntherefore are potentially (bio) degradable. Moreover, sulphide bonds \n\nwere found to tune degradability of acrylates (RYDHOLM; BOWMAN; \n\nANSETH, 2005; RYDHOLM et al., 2006b; RYDHOLM; ANSETH; \n\nBOWMAN, 2007). \n\nBased on the above facts and considerations, polymeric materials \n\nfrom biofeedstocks-derived monomers are a promising environmentally \n\nfriendly alternative to petrol-derived polymers, especially for purposes \n\nas biomedical applications when either biocompatibility or \n\nbiodegradability (or even both) become highly relevant. Nanoparticles \n\nfrom renewable monomers are only recently being studied, in addition \n\nthere are only 4 papers, so far, published in the literature concerning \n\nthiol-ene polymerization in heterogeneous systems. Thiol-ene \n\npolymerization in miniemulsion is a promising technique to synthesize \n\nnanoparticles, or even nanocapsules and hybrid particles, from \n\n26\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nrenewable monomers. Besides, thiol-ene polymerization kinetics in \n\nminiemulsion is expected to greatly differ from both traditional free-\n\nradical and step-growth miniemulsion polymerizations and it certainly \n\nneeds to be evaluated. \n\n \n\n1.1 OBJECTIVES \n \n\n1.1.1 General Objectives \n \n\nThis work aims to investigate the synthesis of a novel monomer \n\nderived from renewable raw materials, such as vegetable oil and \n\nsaccharide, and subsequently to use the produced green monomer to \n\nperform thiol-ene polymerization in miniemulsion to yield polymer \n\nnanoparticles and in bulk for comparison. \n \n\n1.1.2 Specific Objectives \n \n\n1 \u2013 Synthesis and characterisation of a renewable ?,?-diene diester \n\nmonomer using castor oil and isosorbide as chemical platforms. \n\n2 \u2013 Synthesis and characterisation of polymeric sub-micrometric \n\nparticles through thiol-ene polymerization in miniemulsion using the \n\nsynthesized ?,?-diene diester monomer. \n\n3 \u2013 Evaluate the influence of the type and amount of surfactant in thiol-\n\nene miniemulsion polymerization. \n\n4 \u2013 Evaluate the effect of temperature, initiator type and concentration \n\non molecular weight in thiol-ene polymerization in miniemulsion. \n\n5 \u2013 Compare molecular weight results from bulk polymerization and \n\nminiemulsion polymerization to evaluate the existence of radical \n\ncompartmentalization in thiol-ene polymerization \n\n6 \u2013 Characterise the obtained polymeric material regarding its \n\ncrystallinity and thermal properties. \n\n7 \u2013 Investigate the effect of type and amount co-stabilizer to either \n\nproduce polymeric particles with internal phase segregation or \n\nincorporate the co-stabilizer in the polymeric matrix. \n\n8 \u2013 Evaluate molecular weight kinetics of thiol-ene polymerization in \n\nminiemulsion and possibly functional group conversion. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n27\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER II \n \n\n2 SYNTHESIS OF MONOMERS FROM RENEWABLE \n\nRESOURCES \n \n\nIn the past few decades, efforts to achieve sustainability in \n\ndiverse scientific and technologic fields have been done. Concerns about \n\nthe depletion of fossil oil reserves and an aggravation in the global \n\nwarming are driving a pursuit for renewable raw materials \n\nsubstituents(MEIER; METZGER; SCHUBERT, 2007). The utilization \n\nof renewable resources should be a compromise assumed in the \n\ndevelopment of new technologies. The replacement of the traditional \n\nnon-renewable raw materials of existent technologies should also be \n\nstimulated. \n\nRenewable raw materials commonly utilized in the chemical \n\nindustry are plant oils, polysaccharides from vegetal or animal fonts \n\n(starch, cellulose, chitosan and chitin), mono- and disaccharides, and \n\nwood (cellulose, lignin, hemicellulose and natural rubber) (MEIER; \n\nMETZGER; SCHUBERT, 2007; BELGACEM; GANDINI, 2008; \n\nMUTLU, 2012). \n\nThe modification of natural polymers is a longstanding approach, \n\nwhich has been exhaustively investigated since the nineteenth century. \n\nThere are several techniques developed to chemically modify natural \n\npolymers in order to achieve the desired characteristic for the material, \n\ne.g. inserting functional groups, cross-liking, blending or \n\ncopolymerizing to a different class of polymer (SHALABY; SHAH, \n\n1991; G\u00dcNAY; THEATO; KLOK, 2011, 2013). However, modifying \n\nnaturally-obtained materials can be complicated due to its structural \n\ncomplexity. On the other hand, the synthesis of novel classes of \n\nmonomers is a very interesting manner of designing the polymeric \n\nmacromolecule and overcome some issues such as (bio) degradability \n\nand physical properties. \n\nBy designing the monomer, it is possible to include in the \n\npolymeric molecule functional groups or even chemical bonds that \n\nfacilitate biodegradation, e.g.  the inclusion of strategically positioned \n\ngrafts in the polymeric backbone that could enable the enzymes to attach \n\nmore easily to the substrate binding site or the inclusion of disulphide \n\nbonds in the polymer\u2018s main chain. \n\nModification of natural polymers is also restrained to the physical \n\nproperties of the material to be modified. Desired features for specific \n\napplications could be more easily reached by polymerization of \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nmonomeric species rather than modification of an already existing \n\nmacromolecule. \n\n \n\n2.1 VEGETABLE OILS AS RENEWABLE RESOURCES IN \n\nPOLYMER CHEMISTRY \n\n \n\nVegetable oils are one of the most widely used renewable \n\nresources in the chemical industries owing to their excellent \n\nenvironmental credentials, including their biodegradability, low toxicity, \n\navoidance of volatile organic chemicals, easy availability and relatively \n\nlow price (VERH\u00c9, 2004; BELGACEM; GANDINI, 2008). According \n\nto a report from USDA (2015), the global production of the major \n\nvegetable oils in the period 2013/14 summed 170.87 million metric tons \n\n(Table 1), comparing it to annual production from 2012/13 there was an \n\nincrease of roughly 10 million metric tons. The prospective is that the \n\nworldwide production continues to rise based on the data from Table 1. \n\n \nTable 1 Annual production of the main vegetable oils. \n\nVegetable Oil \n\nAnnual Production (million metric tons) \n\n2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 \nFeb \n\n2014/15 \n\nCoconut 3.71 3.41 3.66 3.46 3.43 \n\nCottonseed 4.96 5.22 5.21 5.13 5.12 \n\nOlive 3.27 3.45 2.44 3.15 2.34 \n\nPalm 49.14 52.44 56.49 59.42 62.44 \n\nPalm Kernel 5.75 6.16 6.57 6.99 7.29 \n\nPeanut 5.31 5.29 5.49 5.58 5.52 \n\nRapeseed 23.03 24.10 24.92 26.43 26.95 \n\nSoybean 41.40 42.73 43.10 44.96 47.44 \n\nSunflowerseed 12.21 14.73 13.27 15.75 15.18 \n\nTotal 148.76 157.53 161.13 170.87 175.69 \n\nSource: USDA (2015). \n\n30\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nVegetable oil\u2018s average price is higher when compared to petrol, \n\nfor instance palm, canola and coconut oils have average prices (Oct-Sept \n\n2013/14) of respectively USD 803; 954; 1278 per metric ton according \n\nto USDA. Crude oil\u2018s price for the same period was USD 93.26 and \n\n98.52 per barrel from WTI (EUA) and Brent (Europe), \n\nrespectively (EIA, 2015), which is approximately USD 684 and 722 per \n\nmetric ton depending on the oil density. The price of vegetable oil is \n\nexpected to decrease in the future with the increase of its utilization in \n\nsustainable industries. In fact, vegetable oils are used in chemical \n\nindustries as ingredients or components in many manufactured products, \n\nsuch as soaps, drying agents, paints, coatings, insulators, hydraulic \n\nfluids, lubricants, monomers (e.g. dimer acids and polyols) and \n\npolymers (TURLEY, 2008). \n\nVegetable oils consist mainly of triglycerides (TG), about 93\u201398 \n\nwt.%, together with di- and monoglycerides and phosphoglycerides as \n\nminor components (SENIHA G\u00dcNER; YA?CI; TUNCER ERCIYES, \n\n2006; LU; LAROCK, 2009). Triglycerides consist of three fatty acid \n\nchains esterified to a glycerol molecule (Figure 1). TG differ \n\ndramatically in the ratio and the type of fatty acids, which depends on \n\ntheir origins (Table 1). Table 2 shows the fatty acid content and double \n\nbond per TG of commodity vegetable oils from different origins. \n\n \nFigure 1. General chemical structure of triglycerides.

Figure 2 shows the chemical structures of the \n\nfatty acids most commonly used in polymer chemistry: oleic, linoleic, \n\nlinolenic, ricinoleic, and erucic acids (ESPINOSA; MEIER, 2011). \n\n \nFigure 2.

Triglycerides can undergo cationic \n\npolymerization (LI; LAROCK, 2005), free radical polymerization \n\n(ESEN; K\u00dcSEFO?LU; WOOL, 2007), or olefin metathesis \n\npolymerization (RYBAK; FOKOU; MEIER, 2008; ROMERA et al., \n\n2015), due to the presence of double bonds in their chain. \n\n \n\n2.1.1.1 Free Radical Polymerization of Vegetable Oil \n \n\nCarbon-carbon double bonds contained in plant oils are likely to \n\nbe polymerized via free radical mechanism. Even so, radical \n\npolymerization of fatty acids and triglycerides has not been given plenty \n\nattention due to the presence of chain transfer processes which occur in \n\nthe allylic positions of fatty acids chains (LU; LAROCK, 2009). Chain \n\ntransfer processes reduce the average molecular weight of the final \n\npolymer; therefore, there is a high chance of obtaining low molecular \n\nweight polymers through free radical method. \n\nConjugated carbon\u2013carbon double bonds in vegetable oils are \n\nusually used for free radical polymerization because their double bonds \n\nare relatively easily attacked by free radicals (LI; LAROCK, 2001, \n\n2002a; LI; HANSON; LAROCK, 2001). \n\n \n\n2.1.1.2 Cationic Polymerization of Plant Oil \n\n \n\nCarbon-carbon double bonds in fatty acids are slightly more \n\nnucleophilic than those in ethylene and propylene; therefore, vegetable \n\noils are also capable of being polymerized through cationic route. The \n\nconjugated double bonds from drying oils \u2013 oils that undergo \n\ncrosslinking by the action of oxygen \u2013 are even more reactive for \n\ncationic polymerization. Plant oils can be thermodynamically considered \n\nas cationic monomers (LU; LAROCK, 2009) \n\n \n\n2.1.1.3 Olefin Metathesis Polymerization of Plant Oils \n\n \n\nOlefin metathesis is a metal-catalysed reaction where the \n\nalkylidene groups are exchanged. The most common metal-complexes, \n\nutilized for this process, are those containing W, Mo, Re or Ru.  \n\n33\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSeveral techniques have been developed for olefin metathesis to \n\nbe employed in polymer synthesis such as acyclic diene \n\nmetathesis (ADMET) polymerization (RYBAK; FOKOU; MEIER, \n\n2008), acyclic triene metathesis (ATMET) polymerization (RYBAK; \n\nFOKOU; MEIER, 2008; ROMERA et al., 2015) and ring-opening \n\nmetathesis polymerization (ROMP) (XIA; LAROCK, 2010).  \n\nMeier\u2018s group (2008) has performed ADMET and ATMET \n\npolymerizations of soybean oil and glyceryl triundec-10-enoate \n\nrespectively, resulting in a range of materials from sticky oils to rubber. \n\nRomera and colleagues (2015) studied the ATMET polymerization of \n\nlinseed oil both in bulk and in miniemulsion. The authors reported low \n\nmolecular weight (MN = 6 kDa) and justified that the presence of oleic \nacid moieties and saturated fatty acids limited both molecular weight \n\nincrease and cross-linking because they acted as chain-stoppers. \n\n \n\n2.3 MONOMERS FROM PLANT OILS \n \n\nDespite all the attempts to synthesize green polymers capable of \n\nreplacing commercial polymers, the polymerization of raw vegetable \n\noils has not quite shown itself as a suitable alternative to achieve \n\nphysical and chemical properties similar to petrol-derived polymers. The \n\npolymerization attempts of triglycerides, which are multifunctional \n\nmonomers, usually ended up with the synthesis of cross-linked \n\npolymers. Vegetable oils are usually copolymerized to non-renewable \n\nmonomers such as styrene, divinylbenzene, norbonadiene and acrylates  \n\nto achieve the required physical-chemical properties (LI; LAROCK, \n\n2001, 2002b; LI; HANSON; LAROCK, 2001; LU; LAROCK, 2009, \n\n2010; MEIORIN; ARANGUREN; MOSIEWICKI, 2012). \n\nNovel monomers derived from plant oils have been investigated \n\ndue to the possibility of designing the monomeric molecules. Many \n\ntypes of polymers can be synthesized from fatty acids-derived \n\nmonomers; for instance polyesters and polyamides (MEIER; \n\nMETZGER; SCHUBERT, 2007; KREYE et al., 2012; VILELA; \n\nSILVESTRE; MEIER, 2012). \n\nFatty acids are very interesting platforms for novel monomers \n\nsyntheses because they provide a vast stereochemical diversity and a \n\nvariety of chemical modifications are possible. There are typically 5 \n\nchemically reactive sites, shown in Figure 3, where a triglyceride can be \n\nchemically modified to synthesize different kinds of monomers \n\n(MUTLU, 2012).  \n\n \n\n34\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3. Structure of a generic triglyceride displaying its chemically reactive \n\nsites. \n\n \nSource: Adapted from Mutlu (2012). \n\n \n\nMany are the chemical reactions that triglycerides can be \n\nsubmitted to, e.g. hydrolysis, transesterification, halogenation, \n\nsaponification, reduction, amination, ozonolysis, epoxidation, \n\nmetathesis, thiol-ene coupling, carbonylation, addition reaction, Fiedel-\n\nKrafts alkylation, Claisen condensation, ?-oxidation and numerous \n\nmore. Traditionally most of the reactions utilized to modify the chemical \n\nstructure of fatty acids focus on the ester group to synthesize fatty \n\nalcohols, soaps, esters, thioesters, hydrazides, amides or amines. \n\nHowever, in the past two decades the attention has turned to \n\nfunctionalize the alkyl chain of the fatty acid, especially through \n\nreactions involving the double bond present in some fatty acids chains \n\n(MUTLU, 2012).  \n\nMany sorts of monomers can be synthesized starting from \n\nvegetable oil platforms, such as hydrocarboxylic acids, hydroxyesters, \n\ndiesters, dicarboxylic acids, polyols and ?,? dienes containing several \n\nfunctionalities (OVETKOVI? et al., 2008; RYBAK; MEIER, 2008; \n\nQUINZLER; MECKING, 2009, 2010; KREYE; T\u00d3TH; MEIER, 2011; \n\nTRZASKOWSKI et al., 2011; KREYE et al., 2012; CARDOSO et al., \n2014) \n\nOvetkovi? et al. (2008), synthesized 9-hydroxynonanoic acid \nmethyl ester from castor oil through ozonation followed by reductive \n\nozonolysis. The monomer was prepared in two steps and then \n\npolycondensed to yield polyhydroxy alcanoate. Quinzler and Mercking \n\n(2010) used catalysed methoxycarbonylation reactions (PUGH; \n\nPRINGLE; DRENT, 2001; JIM\u00c9NEZ-RODRIGUEZ; EASTHAM; \n\nCOLE-HAMILTON, 2005) to produce ?,?-diesters monomers from \nunsaturated fatty acid esters and subsequently longer-chain aliphatic \n\npolyesters (Mw up to 2\u00b710\n4\n g\u00b7mol\n\n-1)\n. Interestingly, the complete \n\nincorporation of the carbon-backbone in the polymeric chain provided \n\nsufficient melt and crystallization temperatures for thermoplastic \n\n35\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nprocessing and applications similar to conventional non-renewable \n\npolymers.  \n\nYang and co-workers (2010) described a biochemical route to \n\nproduce ?-carboxy fatty acid monomers from oleic, erucic and epoxy \n\nstearic acids through whole-cell biotransformations catalysed by C. \n\ntropicalis ATCC20962. After the biochemical oxidation of terminal \n\nmethyl groups into carboxylic acids moieties, the monomers underwent \n\nenzymatically catalysed polycondensation with diols yielding polyesters \n\nformed by unsaturated and epoxidized repeating units, i.e. a good \n\nretention of functionality of the fatty acid was observed. \n\nTrzaskowski and co-workers (2011) synthesized poly (1,20-\n\neicosadiyl-1,20-eicosanedioate) (Mn = 10\n4\n g mol\n\n-1\n) through \n\npolycondensation of stoichiometric amounts of 1,20-eicosanedioc acid \n\nand eicosane-1,20-diol catalyzed by titanium alkoxides. The C20 diacid \n\nand C20 diol used as co-monomers were synthesized by self-metathesis \n\nof undec-10-enoic acid followed by hydrogenation. The corresponding \n\n?,?-diene undec-10-enyl undec-10-enoate was prepared by esterification \n\nof undecenoic acid with undec-10-en-1-ol catalysed by titanium \n\nisopropoxide as previously reported in the literature by Rybak and Meier \n\n(2008). ADMET polymerization of the corresponding ?,?-diene yielded \n\na molecular weight 2.8 times higher.  \n\nKreye et al. (2011) synthesized through Ugi reaction (UGI; \n\nFETZER; STEINBR\u00dcCKNER, 1959; D\u00d6MLING, 2006) ?,?-diene amide \n\nmonomers . Kreye and colleagues produced successfully different \n\nvarieties of poly-1-(alkylcarbamoyl) carboxamides via ADMET and \n\nthiol-ene polymerization. Thus, Ugi reaction is a powerful tool to \n\nsynthesize highly substituted ?,?-diene amide monomers from \n\nrenewable resources, in this case, castor oil derivatives. \n\nVilela and co-workers (2012) reported the utilization of a fatty \n\nacid from rapeseed oil, erucic acid, as platform to produce monomers by \n\nself-metathesis followed by hydrogenation of the 9-? unsaturation, \n\nyielding 1,26-hexacosanedioic acid. This long-chain ?,?-dicarboxylic \n\nacid was then polycondensed to hexacosane-1,26-diol, generated from \n\nthe former by reduction, which yielded an aliphatic long-chain polyester \n\n26,26. The research group also successfully polymerized the 1,26-\n\nhexacosanedioic acid with short-chain alkanediols, dodecane-1,12-diol \n\nand butane-1,4-diol, generating polyesters 12,26 and 4,26, respectively. \n\nCardoso et al. (2014) synthesized an ?,?-diene diester, namely \n\n1,3-propylene diundec-10-enoate, from undec-10-oic acid and 1,3-\n\npropanediol derived from castor oil and glycerol, respectively. ?,?-\n\nDiene diester monomer underwent homopolymerization through \n\n36\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nADMET both in bulk and in miniemulsion. Polymer particles obtained \n\nfrom miniemulsion presented sizes from 150 to 350 nm, depending on \n\nthe type and concentration of the surfactants utilized. ADMET \n\npolymerization in miniemulsion yielded polymers with higher molecular \n\nweight (Mn up to 15 kDa) than ADMET polymerization in bulk (Mn up \n\nto 7 kDa). \n\n \n\n2.4 SUGARS AS RENEWABLE RESOURCES IN POLYMER \n\nCHEMISTRY \n\n \nSugars or carbohydrates, as vegetable oils, are renewable \n\nresources that have been explored in polymer chemistry. Carbohydrates \n\nare essential building blocks in nature, therefore are widely available at \n\ninexpensive prices. The total global supply of carbohydrates in 2012 \n\nwas 2.4 billion tons; in addition, cellulosic material and others wastes \n\ncan be processed into sugar, e.g. by hydrolysis with acids, and other \n\norganic raw materials for chemical industries (DELOITTE, 2014). \n\nConsequently, the inevitable changeover of the chemical industry to \n\nbiofeedstocks as its raw materials, due to fossil resources depletion, \n\nmight certainly embrace carbohydrates and its derivatives. In polymer \n\nchemistry, carbohydrates are important building blocks to produce \n\nbiodegradable and biocompatible materials. There is a rich variety of \n\nsugar-based monomers that can be obtained, e.g. alditols; lactones, \n\naldonic and aldaric acids; and aminosugars (GALBIS; GARC\u00cdA-\n\nMART\u00cdN, 2008). \n\n \n\n2.4.1 Polymerization of sugar-based monomers \n\n \n\nCarbohydrates are multifunctional monomers; therefore, its \n\npolymerization is not straightforward. Their functionality usually needs \n\nto be reduced in order to prevent side reactions, for instance overly \n\ncrosslinked polymers. (GALBIS &amp; GARC\u00cdA-MARTIN, 2008). The \n\nmost representative sugar-derived polymers that have been synthesized \n\nare polyesters, polycarbonates, polyethers, and polyurethanes, usually \n\nsynthesized from dianhydroalditols (OKADA; TACHIKAWA; AOI, \n\n1997, 2000; YOKOE; KEIGO; OKADA, 2003; GALBIS; GARC\u00cdA-\n\nMART\u00cdN, 2008; FENOUILLOT et al., 2010; BESSE et al., 2013; \nYOON et al., 2013; POLLONI, 2014; SADLER et al., 2014).  \n\nAlditols are polyols and they occur extensively in nature. In \n\naddition, aldoses and ketoses can be reduced to alditols with the \n\n37\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ngeneration of new hydroxyl groups from the carbonyl functions; for \n\ninstante, D-glucose (aldose) is reduced into D-glucitol (polyol), trivially \n\nreferred to as ?sorbitol\u2018. The reduction of ketoses generates a new \n\nstereogenic centre, and gives two epimeric alditols; for example, D-\n\nfructose produces D-mannitol and D-glucitol. Acyclic alditols are \n\nmultifunctional molecules; therefore, in order to avoid undesirable side-\n\nreactions, their cyclic forms, dianhydroalditols, are usually used in \n\npolymer chemistry. Furthermore, the thermostability of these \n\ndianhydroalditol monomers may be higher than that of other aliphatic \n\ndiols, which raises the glass transition temperature of the corresponding \n\npolymers (GALBIS; GARC\u00cdA-MART\u00cdN, 2008). \n\n \n\n2.4.2 Isosorbide \n\n \n\nIsosorbide (dianhydro-D-glucitol) is a polyol indirectly derived \n\nfrom glucose. It is produced by dehydration from sorbitol and, therefore, \n\nit is a renewable raw material from biomass. Dianhydro D-glucitol has \n\nbeen produced in industrial scale by several years due to the commercial \n\nimportance of its nitro and methyl derivatives. The production is a \n\nmulti-step process where isosorbide is the very last product, starting \n\nfrom starch and going on with D-glucose and sorbitol. Isosorbide has \n\nbeen already remarkably commented and discussed in the literature as \n\nan important chemical platform for the future replacement of petroleum-\n\nbased materials (FL\u00c8CHE; HUCHETTE, 1986; ROSE; PALKOVITS, \n\n2012). \n\n \nFigure 4. Isosorbide chemical structure. \n\nSource: Author. \n\n38\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIsosorbide is a secondary cyclic alcohol made of two cis fused \n\ntetrahydrofuran rings. The angle between the rings is 120\u00b0, with two \n\nsecondary alcohol groups in position 2 and 5. The hydroxyl in position 2 \n\nis in exo conformation while the one in 5 has an endo conformation, \n\nwhat promotes an intra-molecular hydrogen bond that can be detected \n\nthrough IR spectroscopy (FL\u00c8CHE; HUCHETTE, 1986). Some \n\nphysical-chemical properties of crystallized isosorbide are shown in \n\nTable 3. \n\n \nTable 3. Physical-chemical properties of isosorbide. \n\nMelting temperature 61 \u2013 64\u00b0C \n\nBoiling temperature 140\u00b0C (10 mmHg) \n\nFlash point   150\u00b0C \n\nOptical rotation ([  ]) +43.9 \n\nSoluble in \nWater, alcohol, dioxane, \n\nketones \n\nAlmost insoluble in Hydrocarbons, ethers, esters \n\nSource: (FL\u00c8CHE; HUCHETTE, 1986) \n\n \n\nIsosorbide possesses a unique chemical structure and it is worth \n\nto comment some details on its reactivity. Hydroxyl groups\u2018 reactivity in \n\nposition 2 and 5 depends on the reagent and the solvent used and on the \n\nsteric hindrance, especially in the case of substitution reactions that \n\ncould be either inside or outside the V-rings. For example, the endo-\n\ngroup 5 presents higher reactivity toward esterification with acyl halides \n\ndue to intra-molecular hydrogen bonding of this group with the adjacent \n\nring-oxygen atom, whereas it has been demonstrated that esterification \n\nwith acetic anhydride in pyridine takes place favourably in position \n\n2 (FL\u00c8CHE; HUCHETTE, 1986). \n\nIsosorbide has been widely used in the pharmaceutical industry \n\nfor several years. Its nitro and dinitro derivatives are known since 1939 \n\nas vaso-dilators and there is a great interest in using dinitrate isosorbide \n\nfor infarct treatment (FL\u00c8CHE; HUCHETTE, 1986) \n\nIn the field of polymeric materials, isosorbide, as a diol, is firstly \n\nemployed to synthesize or modify polycondensates, such as \n\npolyurethanes and polyesters (FENOUILLOT et al., 2010). Nonetheless, \ndue to its physical-chemical properties, isosorbide has also been applied \n\nin the synthesis of novel monomers to be polymerized via \n\nmetathesis (FOKOU; MEIER, 2009). \n\n39\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFokou and Meier (2009) described the synthesis of a novel \n\nmonomer using isosorbide and 10-undecenoic acid as 100% renewable \n\nbuilding blocks. The resulting molecule is an ?,?- diene diester and it \n\nwas polymerized by ADMET polymerization. They obtained polyesters \n\nwith molecular weight (Mn) up to 8400 Da depending on the reaction \n\nconditions; also they reported the physical-chemical characteristics of \n\nthe polymer such as melting temperature and degree of isomerization. \n\nYoon and co-workers (2013) produced high-molecular-weight \n\npolyester, up to 71100 Da weight-average molecular weight, and with a \n\nhigh Tg of 131\u00b0C. Isosorbide was esterified to cis/trans-1,4-\n\ncyclohexanedicarboxylic acid to yield homopolyesters. Isosorbide is a \n\ndiol with considerably low reactivity which normally results in a long \n\npolymerization time. However, the authors utilized acetic anhydride to \n\nperform an in situ acetylation of isosorbide, they found out that this \nmethod accelerates the chain growth of the polymer. \n\nBesse and colleagues (2013) synthesized isocyanate-free \n\npolyurethanes from isorsorbide derived dicyclocarbonate and four \n\ndifferent diamines. Dicyclocarbonate was obtained from epoxidized \n\nisosorbide by carbonatation. Synthesized linear and branched \n\npolyhydroxyurethanes presented Tg from -8 to 59\u00b0C and degradation \n\ntemperatures from 234 to 255\u00b0C depending on the diamine utilized. \n\nSadler et al. (2014) utilized isosorbide as one of the diol \n\nstructural constituents to produce unsaturated polyesters (UPE) to be \n\nused as thermosetting resins. Isosorbide was found to increase \n\nmechanical properties and Tg according to its concentration. However, \n\nthe increase in the isosorbide content reduced the solubility of the resin \n\nin styrene, which was used as reactive diluent for blending the resins. \n\nAuthors stated that although current formulations are inadequate for \n\nhigh-performance thermosetting applications, these resins do have \n\nviscosities that fall within the necessary ranges for composite \n\napplication and adequately compare to some commercial UPE resins. \n\nFurthermore, it may be possible to use isosorbide in the future to \n\nimprove current aromatic-based UPE resins. \n\nAzizi and co-workers (2014) synthesized isosorbide-based \n\npolyurethane microcapsules for cosmeto-textile applications. \n\nMicrocapsules were prepared by interfacial polycondensation method in \n\nan o/w emulsion system. SEM images have clearly shown spherical \n\ncore-shell morphology of the particles, where the shell was constituted \n\nof PU and the core was constituted of neroline perfume. Particles \n\npresented unimodal size distribution in volume, with an average particle \n\n40\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nsize of 27 ?m. Encapsulation efficiency of perfume was determined \n\nthrough \n1\nH NMR and accounted for 30%. \n\nFinally, isosorbide is an attractive renewable resource derived \n\ncompound to be used in the polymeric materials field due to its unique \n\nbi-ring structure, physical-chemical properties and the fact that it is \n\nderived from starch, not from petroleum. Isosorbide polymers have \n\nsuperior thermal and optical properties due to its molecular rigidity and \n\nthe chirality of its asymmetrical hydroxyl groups (YOON et al., 2013). \nIn addition, several works can be found in the literature reporting \n\nbiodegradable polymers obtained from isosorbide which widens its \n\napplication scope (OKADA; TACHIKAWA; AOI, 1997, 2000; \n\nOKADA et al., 2000; OKADA, 2002; YOKOE; KEIGO; OKADA, \n\n2003; YOKOE; AOI; OKADA, 2005). \n\n \n\n2.5 FINAL CONSIDERATIONS \n \n\nAn extensive number of papers have been published in the past \n\ntwo decades regarding the use of biofeedstocks in polymer chemistry. \n\nHerein, two promising platforms for novel renewable polymeric \n\nmaterials were presented: vegetable oils and carbohydrates. Both \n\nrenewable raw materials are inexpensive and worldwide available.  \n\nNatural polymers can be modified to yield different materials, for \n\ninstance, natural rubber undergoes vulcanization and has its individual \n\npolymer chains cross-linked, improving mechanical properties. That \n\nbeing said, modifying naturally-obtained materials can be complicated \n\ndue to its structural complexity, for example many natural polymers are \n\nmultifunctional such as starch, a polymeric carbohydrate. On the other \n\nhand, the synthesis of novel classes of monomers is a very interesting \n\nmanner of designing the polymeric macromolecule. \n\nVegetable oils can undergo polymerization by different \n\nmechanisms, however, the straightforward polymerization of raw \n\nvegetable oils has not quite shown itself as a suitable alternative to \n\nachieve physical and chemical properties similar to petrol-derived \n\npolymers. Carbohydrates have been used to synthesize polyesters, \n\npolycarbonates, polyethers and polyurethanes. The most utilized \n\ncarbohydrate monomers are dianhydroalditols, such as isosorbide, \n\nbecause they possess only two hydroxyl groups. \n\nRather than being polymerized directly, triglycerides and \n\ncarbohydrates can be used as chemical platforms for new monomers \n\nsyntheses. Triglycerides and fatty acids by extension, and carbohydrates \n\nfeature a vast stereochemical diversity and many reactive sites that can \n\n41\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nbe chemically modified. One of the purposes of the present study is, \n\ntherefore, to combine both fatty acid and carbohydrate into an \n\nenvironmentally friendly monomer. 10-Undecenoic acid, obtained bt \n\npyrolysis of castor oil, and isosorbide, derived from starch, were utilized \n\nto synthesize a ?,?-diene diester monomer. \n\n  \n\n42\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER III \n \n\nThis Chapter is part of a publication entitled ?Thiol-Ene \n\nPolymerisation: A Promising Technique to Obtain Novel \nBiomaterials? submitted to the European Polymer Journal. \n\n \n\n3 THIOL-ENE REACTIONS \n \n\nThiol-ene reactions are often considered as click-chemistry \n\nreactions because they can be carried out under mild conditions and \n\nnormally provide a high yielding and generation of inoffensive by-\n\nproducts (HOYLE; LEE; ROPER, 2004; HOYLE; BOWMAN, 2010). \n\nNovel materials are arising from thiol-ene reactions due to the interest \n\non the unique crosslinking structure, improved mechanical properties, \n\nclean and environmentally harmless reaction, fast and regioselective \n\npolymerization, and degradability improvement that sulphide moieties \n\ncan provide (REDDY; ANSETH; BOWMAN, 2005; RYDHOLM et al., \n2007; RYDHOLM; ANSETH; BOWMAN, 2007). In this context, thiol-\n\nene polymers containing hydrolysable functional groups (RYDHOLM; \n\nBOWMAN; ANSETH, 2005; RYDHOLM et al., 2006a, 2006b, 2007; \n\nRYDHOLM; ANSETH; BOWMAN, 2007; AIMETTI; MACHEN; \n\nANSETH, 2009; WANG et al., 2013), e.g. ester groups, are especially \ninteresting in order to obtain (bio) degradable materials. In addition, \n\nmany of the diene monomers used in thiol-ene polymerization are \n\nderived from renewable raw materials (T\u00dcR\u00dcN\u00c7; MEIER, 2010, 2013; \n\nFIRDAUS; MONTERO DE ESPINOSA; MEIER, 2011; WU et al., \n\n2011; T\u00dcR\u00dcN\u00c7 et al., 2012; VAN DEN BERG et al., 2013). \n\nThiol-ene reactions have been extensively utilized for surface and \n\nmolecules functionalization (FEIDENHANS\u2018L et al., 2014; CHEN et \n\nal., 2015; IONESCU et al., 2015; KUHLMANN et al., 2015), molecules \n\nconjugation (STENZEL, 2013; KUHLMANN et al., 2015), \n\ncrosslinking (ACOSTA ORTIZ et al., 2010; WANG et al., 2013), \n\ngrafting (KOLB; MEIER, 2013), UV-curable coatings (BLACK; \n\nRAWLINS, 2009; SANGERMANO et al., 2009; \u00c7AKMAK\u00c7I et al., \n\n2012) and polymerization of renewable monomers (KREYE; T\u00d3TH; \n\nMEIER, 2011; T\u00dcR\u00dcN\u00c7 et al., 2012; KOLB; MEIER, 2013; \n\nT\u00dcR\u00dcN\u00c7; MEIER, 2013; YOSHIMURA et al., 2015). In addition, \n\nsome studies reported a set of biomedical applications for thiol-ene \n\npolymers such as preparation of nanoparticles and hydrogels suitable for \n\ndrug-delivery systems, biomimetic hydrogels, dental restorative resins \n\nand hydrogels for tissue regeneration (CARIOSCIA et al., 2005; LU et \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nal., 2005; AIMETTI; MACHEN; ANSETH, 2009; ZOU et al., 2011; \n\nROBERTS; BRYANT, 2013; \u0160TORHA; MUN; KHUTORYANSKIY, \n\n2013; HACHET et al., 2014; KI et al., 2014; VANDENBERGH et al., \n2014; YANG et al., 2014). Thiol-ene polymers as biomaterials is, \n\nhowever, an underexplored field. \n\n \n\n3.1 HISTORY AND CONTEXT \n\n \n\nThiol chemistry is a versatile tool and its use has been reported \n\nover several years comprising several fields. Posner (1905) first \n\ndescribed, in 1905, the addition of mercaptans to olefins, the author \n\nreports the thiol coupling to different types of mono and bi-unsaturated \n\ncompounds such as aliphatics, aromatics, terpenes, and hydroaromatics. \n\nPosner noticed that the structure of the olefin exercises strong influence \n\non the fate of the reaction and that mercaptans are added to double \n\nbonds in an anti-Markovnikov arrangement. Furthermore, two of the 15 \n\nstudied diolefins, namely limonene and cyclo-pentadiene, yielded only \n\nmonoaddition products, probably in reason of the different reactivity of \n\nthe double bonds present in the molecules.  \n\nAmongst a set of thiol group reactions, thiol-ene free radical \n\naddition drags special interest due to its application range and \n\nsimplicity. Early work on this field has appeared in late 1930s to early \n\n1950s (KHARASCH; READ; MAYO, 1938; MEISSNER; \n\nTHOMPSON, 1938; HOYLE; LEE; ROPER, 2004). For over 70 years \n\nthe photochemistry of thiols has been investigated from several points of \n\nview e.g. thiol decomposition, as a source of hydrogen atoms in the gas \n\nphase and in solution, as a source of thiyl radicals (  ?) (CARLSON; \nKNIGHT, 1973). Marvel and Chambers (1948) developed the first \n\nmethod to synthesize solid polymeric alkylene sulphides with molecular \n\nweight up to 14 kDa based on papers published then that reported non-\n\ndistillable residues upon allyl mercaptan synthesis and afterward the \n\nutilization of dithiols and diolefins to synthesize liquid polymeric \n\nalkylene sulphides with molecular weight up to 1.3 kDa. \n\nMarvel and Chambers (1948) utilized a set of different dithiols \n\nand diolefins but the UV-initiated polymerization between \n\nhexamethylenedithiol and 1,5-hexadiene portrayed the best result. \n\nInfrared absorption analysis revealed that the synthesized linear \n\npolymers had a structure resulted from an anti-Markovnikov addition, \n\nwhich agrees with Posner\u2018s work. X-ray diffraction showed that the \n\nsolid polymers obtained presented crystalline structure. \n\n44\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThere were several efforts, from late 1970s to early 1990s, to \n\nsolidly introduce thiol-ene photopolymerization in industrial scale \n\n(HOYLE; LEE; ROPER, 2004). By the early 2000\u2018s many of the basics \n\nof thiol\u2013ene chemistry were well defined, thiol-ene free-radical \n\nphotoinitiated polymerization became significant due to several \n\nadvantages over conventional free radical-polymerization such as fast \n\nreaction rates and reduced influence of oxygen inhibition. Their use for \n\nrelatively simple materials applications, such as protective coatings and \n\nfilm were amply touted (HOYLE; LEE; ROPER, 2004; HOYLE; \n\nBOWMAN, 2010).  \n\nIn the past few years the growing interest in green chemistry has \n\ndrawn attention to thiol-ene polymerization as a technique to synthesize \n\npolymers from non-depleting sources and in several others emerging \n\ntechnologies. Moreover, thiol-ene reactions are regioselective, most \n\nrequire mild conditions, and are insensitive to ambient conditions such \n\nas oxygen and humidity (HOYLE; BOWMAN, 2010); this versatility \n\nmakes thiol-ene chemistry a promising tool that can be applied in a set \n\nof applications e.g. resins (AUVERGNE et al., 2012), protective \n\npolymers (BERGER; DELHALLE; MEKHALIF, 2009; \n\nSANGERMANO et al., 2009; \u00c7AKMAK\u00c7I et al., 2012; CHEN et al., \n\n2015), polymers with optical properties (LI; ZHOU; HOYLE, 2009; \n\nFEIDENHANS\u2018L et al., 2014), biomedical and bioconjugated molecules \n\n(ROBERTS; BRYANT, 2013). \n\nThiol-ene reaction relies on the liability of thiol hydrogen. \n\nThermochemical characteristics of thiols are an important factor \n\ninfluencing mechanistic elucidations of thiol-ene kinetics. Initial work \n\non thiol group free-radical reactions had been done through a \n\nphotochemical approach (KNIGHT, 1974), however the cleavage of \n\nsulphur-hydrogen bond can be promoted indirectly by heat- or light- \n\ngenerated nucleophilic radicals obtained from the cleavage of initiators, \n\nas in conventional free-radical polymerization (HOYLE; LEE; ROPER, \n\n2004; CLAUDINO, 2011). \n\nThe     bond is the weakest one in the molecule, about 73 \nkcal mol\n\n-1\n, while the     bond is 88 \u00b1 5 kcal mol\n\n-1\n. Regardless of this \n\nenergy difference, the main decomposition is the     cleavage due to \nliability of the sulphydryl hydrogen, which is the essentially exclusive \n\nsite of abstractive attack on thiol molecule. In a system where there are \n\nothers molecules susceptible to radical attack, e.g. olefins, the \n\nconsiderably lower activation energy for hydrogen removal from thiol \n\ngroup as compared to other hydrogen donor groups results in a high \n\nreactivity (KNIGHT, 1974) \n\n45\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe hydrogen abstraction from the thiol group generates highly \n\nreactive thiyl radicals (  ?) that add to a wide range of unsaturated \ncompounds, virtually, any non-sterically hindered ene is capable of \n\nparticipating the reaction; though, for a given thiol, electron-rich enes \n\npolymerize much more rapidly than electron-poor enes (HOYLE; \n\nBOWMAN, 2010). The addition of a thiol across the olefin double bond \n\nis an exothermic reaction and the enthalpy depends mainly on the sort of \n\nthe double bond, i.e. electron-poor double bonds give off more energy \n\nthan electron-rich double bonds (HOYLE; BOWMAN, 2010). \n\n \n\n3.1.1 Thiol-ene reaction mechanism \n\n \n\nPrimary studies regarding thiol-ene kinetics took place through \n\nthe prism of photochemistry. The first investigations of the \n\nphotochemical decomposition of thiols date back to 1938 \n\n(KHARASCH; READ; MAYO, 1938; MEISSNER; THOMPSON, \n\n1938). Steer and Knight (1969) wrote a very elucidating paper on \n\nreactions of thiyl radicals; the authors studied the photolysis of \n\nmethanethiol as a pure substrate and with added NO, as radical \n\nscavenger, C2H4, and inert gases. The mechanism proposed by the \n\nauthors presented qualitative agreement to the observed kinetics data, \n\nthus several rate-constant ratios had been determined.   \n\nKnight (1974) provided a detailed description of the kinetic steps \n\nof the photoinitiated addition of methanethiol to ethylene in gas phase: \n\n \n\n                ?   ? (1\n) \n\n ?            ?     (2\n) \n\n ?           ?   (3\n) \n\n  ?                       ? (4\n) \n\n                                       ? (5\n) \n\n     ?            \n \n \n           \n\n(6\n\n) \n\n    ?               ?   (7\n) \n\n      ?                ?            (8\n) \n\n46\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe previous mechanism presents the existing reactions involved \n\nin a thiol-ene addition elucidated by analysing the products formed in \n\nthe overall reaction, in this instance: methyl ethyl sulphide (8), hydrogen \n\n(2), and ethane (4). Methyl ethyl sulphide (        ) is the major \nproduct observed in the process. Hydrogen and methyl ethyl disulphide, \n\nthe main chain termination products, decrease with increasing ethylene \n\npressure (STEER; KNIGHT, 1969).  \n\nKnight\u2018s group (1969, 1973) studied the photolysis of \n\nmercaptans, namely ethanethiol, in condensed phase. Hydrogen and \n\ndiethyl disulphide were the only products detected; in addition, \n\nhydrogen and disulphide yields were the same. Due to the equivalence \n\nbetween the reaction products, the authors ruled out termination through \n\nthyil radical disproportionation, therefore termination occurs by \n\ncombination of two radicals. \n\nMartin, Jourdain and Le Bras (1988) wrote a clarifying paper \n\nportraying the fate of the hydrogen atom in reactions with methanethiol \n\nand ethanethiol; rather than participating in molecular hydrogen \n\nproduction or triggering the formation of a carbon-centred radical in the \n\nalkene,  ? can take part in hydrogen sulphide production among other \npossible reaction paths. The authors estimated kinetic constants and \n\nelucidated the reaction mechanisms. \n\n \n\n3.2 THIOL-ENE POLYMERIZATION \n\n \n\nThiol-ene polymerization proceeds as the traditional free-radical \n\npolymerization, featuring three steps: initiation, propagation, and \n\ntermination, plus a chain transfer step. In the mechanistically \n\nfundamental chain-transfer pace a carbon-centred radical transfers its \n\nelectron to a thiol group. Generally, it is used a thiol:ene ratio of 1:1 in \n\norder to avoid side-reactions, such as reaction 6 where disulphide is \n\nformed. It is important to notice that a proper copolymerization between \n\nolefin and thiol molecules will only take place if the first is a diene and \n\nthe latter a dithiol. \n\nFigure 5 shows a simplified scheme of thiol-ene \n\ncopolymerization. Firstly, a thiol is decomposed into thiyl radicals \n\nthrough hydrogen abstraction, which can be by photo- or \nthermoinitiation with the aid or not of initiators. Secondly, the thiyl \n\nradical attacks the double bond and add to the olefin. Finally, chain \n\ntransfer occurs and the unpaired electron from a carbon-centred radical \n\nis transferred to another thiol group and another thiyl radical is \n\ngenerated, re-initialising the cycle. Thus, thiol-ene polymerization \n\n47\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nrevolves around the alternation between thiyl radical propagation across \n\nene functional groups and chain-transfer reactions (HOYLE; \n\nBOWMAN, 2010). Termination, Figure 6, occurs through radical \n\ncombination rather than disproportionation, as discussed by Carlson and \n\nKnight (1973), thiyl/thiyl coupling yielding a disulphide specie, \n\nthiyl/carbon-centred radical coupling and carbon-centred/carbon-centred \n\nradicals coupling. Cramer and co-workers (2003) elucidated   that chain \n\ntransfer is the rate-limiting step by performing studies on thiol-ene \n\nphoto-polymerization modelling through the polymerization kinetics \n\nbehaviour.  \n\n \n\nFigure 5.

Termination mechanisms present in thiol-ene polymerization. \n\n \nSource: Author. \n\n \n\nIn the ideal step-growth thiol\u2013ene reaction, there is no \n\npropagation of the carbon-centred radical through the ene moiety \n\n(homopolymerization), the carbon-centred radical is always transferred \n\nto a thiol moiety.  Normally, conversions approach 100 % unless mass-\n\ntransfer limitations prevent such from being achieved. The net reaction, \n\ntherefore, is simply the combination of the thiol and ene functional \n\ngroups, which causes the molecular weight and network structure to \n\nevolve in a manner that is identical to any other step-growth \n\npolymerization reactions at the same time as empowering all of the \n\nbenefits of a rapid, photo- or thermoinitiated radical mediated process \n\n(HOYLE; BOWMAN, 2010). The diene may undergo \n\nhomopolymerization in a non-ideal system. It depends on the relative \n\nreactivity of both monomers, i.e., the propagation rate constant (  ) is \nsignificantly higher than chain transfer rate constant (   ). \n\nDifferently from traditional free-radical polymerization, the \n\npresence of oxygen does not inhibit thiol-ene polymerization. In the \n\npresence of oxygen, additional chain-transfer reactions occur, the \n\noxygen is incorporated into the growing polymer chains as a peroxy \n\nradical that undergoes chain transfer with a thiol to generate a thyil \n\nradical (CRAMER; BOWMAN, 2001). For a detailed discussion on the \n\nrole of the oxygen in the thiol-ene reaction, the reader is referred to the \n\n49\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nwork by O\u2018Brien, Cramer and Bowman (2006) approaching the overall \n\neffect of oxygen in thiol-acrylate photopolymerization. \n\n \n\n3.2.1 Reactivity of thiol and ene compounds \n \n\nMorgan, Magnota and Ketley (1977) evaluated  the effect of both \n\nthiol and olefin structures on the overall rate towards thiol-ene addition \n\nreaction. Their work stated two fundamental rules. First, the overall \n\nconversion of thiol-ene reaction is directly related to the electron density \n\non the ene, with electron-rich enes reacting faster than electron-poor \n\nenes in reason of the electrophilic nature of thiyl radicals. Electron-\n\ndonating substituents attached or close to the double bond accelerate \n\nthiol addition while electron-withdrawing groups decrease the addition \n\nrate. The most common exception to this rule is when the carbon-\n\ncentred allyl radical is resonance-stabilized, e.g. conjugated dienes. \n\nSecond, mercaptopropionate esters copolymerize more rapidly than \n\nmercaptoacetate esters, which in turn react more rapidly than alkyl \n\nmercaptans, because of the intramolecular interaction between the \n\nsulphydryl hydrogen and the carbonyl that weakens     bond \nenhancing hydrogen liability. \n\nRoper and co-workers (2004) also investigated the influence of \n\nchemical structure in the reactivity of alkenes towards thiol-ene \n\nphotopolymerization and their results corroborate Morgan et al.\u2018s \n\nobservations. Primarily, any non-hindered terminal ene group reacts \n\nrapidly and its aliphatic hydrocarbon substituent chain length has no \n\neffect on the reaction; accordingly, its reactivity is higher than internal \n\nalkenes. The authors observed that chain transfer to the thiol is the rate-\n\nlimiting step corroborating Cramer et al.\u2018s (2003) results. Therefore, any \nchange in the alkene structure that disrupts chain transfer from the \n\ncarbon-centred radical to the thiol, e.g. steric hindrance, causes a \n\nreduction in kct, and therefore decreases the overall reaction rate \n\n(ROPER et al., 2004). \n\nHoyle; Lee &amp; Roper (2004) classify the reactivity of the enes \n\ntowards thiol-ene reaction through the ratio kp/kct; even though not all \n\nthe olefins cited are dienes, the following sequence also can be \n\nconsidered regarding thiol-ene polymerization: \n\nNorborene > Vinyl ether > Propenyl > Alkene ? Vinyl ester > N-\n\nVinyl amides > Allyl ether > N-Vinyl amides > Acrylate > Acrylonitrile \n\n~ Methacrylate > Styrene > Conjugated dienes. \n\nNorborene presents a remarkably fast polymerization rate because \n\nof the significant energy liberation after the thiyl radical addition across \n\n50\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthe ?-bond, which reliefs the ring strain, and the succeeding quick H-\n\nabstraction rate of the sulphydryl hydrogen by the carbon-centred \n\nradical. Methacrylate, styrene, and conjugated dienes possess low \n\nreaction rates owing to the high stability of their respective carbon-\n\ncentred radicals that have intrinsically low H-abstraction rate constants \n\n(HOYLE; LEE; ROPER, 2004). \n\n \n\n3.2.2 Thiol-ene polymers degradation \n\n \n\nBowman\u2018s group performed primary works on the subject of \n\nthiol-ene polymers degradation. Initial studies in the literature presented \n\nresults on thiol-acrylate polymers degradation and others containing the \n\nester group in the main chain (poly (thioether-ester)) probably due to the \n\nease hydrolysis of ester groups, already demonstrated elsewhere \n\n(M\u00dcLLER; KLEEBERG; DECKWER, 2001; WITT et al., 2001; \n\nMUELLER, 2006; NAIR; LAURENCIN, 2007; LEJA; \n\nLEWANDOWICZ, 2010).  \n\nReddy, Anseth and Bowman (2005) investigated the \n\ndegradability of thiol-acrylate hydrogels. The authors have shown it is \n\npossible to synthesize polymeric networks with specific degradation \n\nprofiles. Hydrogels were obtained through copolymerizing \n\nmultifunctional thiol monomers with PLA-b-PEG-b-PLA based \n\ndiacrylate monomers.  Due to the nature of the acrylate double bonds, \n\ntwo different polymerization mechanisms are observed: chain growth \n\npolymerization, i.e. acrylate homopolymerization, and step growth \n\npolymerization, addition of thiol across the ene double bond.  The \n\nbalance between these two mechanisms, which is controlled through \n\nstoichiometry, dictates the network structure and, ultimately, the \n\ndegradation behaviour. In addition, the number of crosslinks per kinetic \n\nchain was shown to decrease with increasing thiol concentration or \n\ndecreasing thiol functionality, thus providing a facile means to control \n\nthe network evolution and hence the degradation behaviour. \n\nA paper recently published (WU et al., 2015) evaluated the acidic \n\ndegradation of linear poly(\u00df-thioether ester) and poly(\u00df-thioether ester-\n\nco-lactone) copolymers. Although Wu et al. chose an enzymatic \n\npolymerization route; \u00df-thioether ester moieties are achievable also \n\nthrough thiol-ene click chemistry. Wu et al. (2015) analyzed molecular \nweight loss and polydispersity variation according to the pH under \n\nwhich the degradation was carried out and to the duration of the \n\ndegradation essay. The authors stated that the thioether-ester polymers \n\nare stable under physiological pH conditions but can be easily \n\n51\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nhydrolyzed under acidic conditions, and therefore these polymers are \n\npotential acid-degradable polymers for biomedical applications.  \n\nBowman\u2018s group obtained further results on biodegradability of \n\nthioether-ester polymers regarding the influence of the position of the \n\nsulphide groups in the degradation rate. Rydholm, Anseth &amp; Bowman \n\n(2007) observed  that the distance between the sulphide and the ester \n\ngroups affects directly the degradation. The closer the sulphide group is \n\nto the ester group the faster hydrolysis is; e.g. when the number of \n\ncarbons between these two groups are increased from 1 to 2 hydrolysis \n\nrate constant became about 4 times lower. For further information \n\nregarding thioether-ester/acrylate polymers degradation, the reader is \n\nreferred to the works of Bowman\u2018s group (REDDY; ANSETH; \n\nBOWMAN, 2005; RYDHOLM; BOWMAN; ANSETH, 2005; \n\nRYDHOLM et al., 2006b; RYDHOLM; ANSETH; BOWMAN, 2007). \nNatural and synthetic biodegradable polymers have prospective \n\napplications in drug and protein delivery, tissue engineering, and \n\nenvironmental issues. These polymers breakdown into smaller \n\nmolecules under specific biological stimuli. Novel biomaterials are \n\narising from thiol-ene polymerization due to the interest on the unique \n\ncrosslinking structure, improved mechanical properties, clean and \n\nenvironmentally harmless reaction, fast and regioselective \n\npolymerization, and degradability improvement that thiol-ene moieties \n\ncan provide (REDDY, ANSETH &amp; BOWMAN, 2005; RYDHOLM, \n\nANSETH &amp; BOWMAN, 2007). Thiol-ene polymers are thereby good \n\ncandidates for biomedical applications and some of these applications \n\nhave already been reported in the literature (AIMETTI, MACHEN &amp; \n\nANSETH, 2009; WANG et al., 2013; VANDENBERGH et al., 2014). \nBowman\u2018s group performed primary works on the subject of \n\nthiol-ene degradation. Initial studies in the literature presented results on \n\ndegradation of thiol-acrylate hydrogels; probably due to the ease \n\nhydrolysis of ester groups already discussed elsewhere (M\u00dcLLER; \n\nKLEEBERG; DECKWER, 2001; LUCAS et al., 2008; TIAN et al., \n2012). \n\n \n\n3.3 THIOL-ENE REATIONS: APPLICATIONS \n \n\nThiol-ene reactions have been extensively utilized for surface and \n\nmolecules functionalization (FEIDENHANS\u2018L et al., 2014; CHEN et \nal., 2015; IONESCU et al., 2015; KUHLMANN et al., 2015), molecules \n\nconjugation (STENZEL, 2013; KUHLMANN et al., 2015), crosslinking \n\n(ACOSTA ORTIZ et al., 2010; WANG et al., 2013), grafting (KOLB; \n\n52\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMEIER, 2013), UV-curable coatings(BLACK; RAWLINS, 2009; \n\nSANGERMANO et al., 2009; \u00c7AKMAK\u00c7I et al., 2012), and \n\npolymerization of renewable monomers. (KREYE; T\u00d3TH; MEIER, \n\n2011; T\u00dcR\u00dcN\u00c7 et al., 2012; KOLB; MEIER, 2013; T\u00dcR\u00dcN\u00c7; \n\nMEIER, 2013; YOSHIMURA et al., 2015). However, little attention has \n\nbeen paid to the potential to synthesize biocompatible and biodegradable \n\npolymers for biomedical application through thiol-ene polymerization. \n\nNatural and synthetic biodegradable polymers have prospective \n\napplications in drug and protein delivery, tissue engineering, and \n\nenvironmental issues. These polymers breakdown into smaller \n\nmolecules under specific biological stimuli. Innovative biomaterials are \n\narising from thiol-ene polymerization due to the interest on the unique \n\ncrosslinking structure, improved mechanical properties, clean and \n\nenvironmentally harmless reaction, fast and regioselective \n\npolymerization, and degradability improvement that thiol-ene moieties \n\ncan provide (REDDY; ANSETH; BOWMAN, 2005; RYDHOLM et al., \n2006b, 2007). Thiol-ene polymers are thereby good candidates for \n\nvarious biomedical applications, and some of these applications have \n\nalready been reported in the literature (AIMETTI; MACHEN; \n\nANSETH, 2009; WANG et al., 2013; VANDENBERGH et al., 2014; \n\nAMATO et al., 2015).  \n \n\n3.4 FINAL CONSIDERATIONS \n\n \n\nHerein, the basics of thiol-ene polymerization and its applications \n\nwere discussed. Thiol-ene polymerization is very often considered as a \n\nclick-chemistry reaction for it can be carried out under mild conditions \n\nand normally provides a high yielding and generation of inoffensive \n\nbyproducts. Thiol-ene polymerization is a versatile method that can be \n\ncarried out by thermal or photoinitiation and normally yields high \n\nconversion (>99%) and possess a rapid kinetics. In addition, by using \n\nmonomers with different functionalities, it is possible to tune some \n\npolymers properties such as degree of crosslinking, degradability, \n\nshrinkage stress and other physical features. Depending on the \n\napplication, different physical and chemical characteristics are desired; \n\ne.g. for drug release within the human body it is very important for \n\npolymeric vectors to be (bio) degradable, on the other hand it is essential \n\nfor dental restorative composites or coatings to be non-degradable and \n\npossess hydrolytic stability.  \n\n53\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nApplications for thiol-ene polymers in the past few years are \n\nmostly as hydrogels and cross-linked polymers. These polymers have \n\nbeen successfully synthesized comprising different kinds of \n\nmultifunctional enes and thiols. Studies reported that thiol-ene polymers \n\nare suitable for preparation of nanoparticles, and hydrogels for drug-\n\ndelivery systems, biomimetic hydrogels, and dental restorative resins. \n\nFurthermore, many authors reported the possibility of tuning the surface \n\nchemistry of hydrogels and nanoparticles by using non-stoichiometric \n\nthiol-ene ratios, which could lead to free thiol groups on the surface, \n\nwhich in turn are capable of binding to other molecules such as proteins. \n\nThis is a very good prospective to further study enzyme-responsive \n\nnanoparticles by anchoring a substrate on the nanoparticle surface. As a \n\ndental restorative resin, thiol-ene polymers displayed superior \n\nmechanical characteristics when compared to the currently utilized \n\nmethacrylate resins. Thiol-ene polymers as biomedical materials is a \n\nfield still underexplored; not many papers have been published under \n\nthis subject even though there are many advantages in using these \n\nmaterials. For instance, it could be studied the accelerated ester group \n\ndegradation due to the presence of sulphide moieties in the polymeric \n\nbackbone towards drug release, the possibility to create bioconjugates \n\non nanoparticles surface using non-reacted thiol groups on its surface to \n\ncreate stimuli-responsive nanocarriers and nanodevices for clinical \n\nexams and imaging. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n54\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER IV \n \n\n4. MINIEMULSION POLYMERIZATION \n\n \n\nMiniemulsions are heterophase systems in which sub-\n\nmicrometric droplets of one phase, typically ranging from 50 to 500 \n\nnm (ANTONIETTI; LANDFESTER, 2002), are dispersed in a second \n\ncontinuous phase. When the miniemulsion consists in an oil-in-water \n\ndispersion it is called direct miniemulsion; the contrary system, i.e. \n\nwater-in-oil dispersion, is named inverse miniemulsion.  \n\nIn contrast to conventional emulsion polymerization, that features \n\nmicelar nucleation, miniemulsion polymerization presents droplet \n\nnucleation, as shown in the pioneering work of Ugeldtad et al. (1973), \n\ni.e. there is no need for mass transfer of monomer through the \n\ncontinuous phase, and therefore the droplets are the polymerization loci. \n\nIdeally, this means that every droplet formed through \n\n(mini) emulsification process may become a particle after \n\npolymerization. Consequently, it is often considered that every droplet \n\nacts like a bulk polymerization nanoreactor (BECHTHOLD et al., 2000; \n\nANTONIETTI; LANDFESTER, 2002).  \n\nMiniemulsion is formed prior to polymerization by high shear \n\nenergy (e.g. by ultrasonication or high-pressure homogenization) which \n\nbreaks down the disperse phase into sub-micrometric droplets, typically \n\ndroplet size range from 50 to 500 nm (BECHTHOLD et al., 2000; \n\nANTONIETTI; LANDFESTER, 2002). Although miniemulsion \n\ndroplets are thermodynamically unstable, they are kinetically metastable \n\nand therefore preserve their colloidal property for a few hours up until a \n\nfew months. Figure 7 shows a scheme to produce a direct miniemulsion. \n\nTwo immiscible phases are subjected to high shear, resulting in small, \n\nhomogeneous, and narrowly distributed nanodroplets. Inside the droplet \n\nphase, an osmotic pressure agent (co-stabilizer) and possible agents for \n\nfurther encapsulation are included. In a subsequent reaction process, \n\nideally no change of the droplets is observed (LANDFESTER, 2009). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7. Miniemulsion polymerization process scheme. \n\n \nSource: Adapted from (LANDFESTER, 2009). \n\n \n\nThe organic phase contains traditionally monomer, a co-\n\nstabilizer, and initiator. Aqueous phase contains water and surfactant. \n\nOrganic and aqueous phases undergo either a mechanical or a magnetic \n\nstirring to form a macroemulsion. Miniemulsion is then obtained when \n\nthe macroemulsion is submitted to high shear energy by means of, \n\nusually, an ultrasonic probe. Once droplets are formed they may be \n\npolymerized into particles. Droplets are stabilized by two main \n\nmechanisms. First, surfactant minimizes droplets coalescence (see \n\nFigure 8) and stabilizes the particles electrostatically or sterically and \n\nhence impedes droplets, as well as particles, to come in close contact \n\nand aggregate. \n\n \n\nSecond, miniemulsion always features a distribution in droplet \n\nsize even when surfactant provides sufficient colloidal stability. \n\nDroplets with different sizes present different interfacial energies or \n\nLaplace pressures, which is inversely proportional to size, and this \n\ndetermines droplet size distribution; in addition, it is a driving force for \n\nFigure 8. Coalescence scheme. \n\nSource: Author \n\n \n\n56\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ndiffusion between the droplets. Diffusion leads to the growth of the \n\nbigger droplets in detriment of the smaller ones, a process known as \n\ndiffusional degradation or Ostwald ripening. Figure 9 shows a scheme \n\nof diffusional degradation. The addition of co-stabilizer in the dispersed \n\nphase, substance with the least water solubility of all components in the \n\nsystem, retards the diffusional degradation. \n\n \n\n \n\nCo-stabilizers cannot be able to diffuse through the aqueous \n\nphase from one droplet to another; therefore, a difference in \n\nconcentration of the co-stabilizer inside the droplets, which increases \n\nwith decreasing droplet size, creates a counterforce upon monomer \n\ndiffusion. Consequently, due to the presence of co-stabilizer an osmotic \n\npressure builds up that counteracts the Laplace pressure responsible for \n\ndiffusional degradation.

ROMERA et \n\nal., 2015) and ADMET (CARDOSO et al., 2014) polymerization, and \nthiol-ene polymerization (JASINSKI et al., 2014b; LOBRY et al., \n\n2014). \n\nIn addition, miniemulsion polymerization is a versatile technique \n\nto synthesize sub-micrometric particles or capsules that suit for a wide \n\nrange of applications that can hardly be achieved through other \n\nheterophase processes, e.g. in situ encapsulation (ROMIO et al., 2009a, \n\n2009b; BERNARDY et al., 2010; CARDOSO; ARA\u00daJO; SAYER, \n\n2013), hybrid particles (ROMIO et al., 2013; STAUDT et al., 2013; \nCHIARADIA et al., 2015; MERKEL et al., 2015), drug delivery \n\nsystems (MESSERSCHMIDT et al., 2009; BEHZADI et al., 2014; \n\nBAIER et al., 2015; FEUSER et al., 2015). \n \n\n4.1 THIOL-ENE POLYMERIZATION IN MINIEMULSION \n\n \n\nThiol-ene polymerization in miniemulsion is a fresh field, many \n\ncharacteristics are still to be studied, such as kinetics and \n\nmechanism (JASINSKI et al., 2014b; LOBRY et al., 2014; AMATO et \n\nal., 2015). Some studies have been performed on the production of \ncross-linked polymer through thiol-ene polymerization in miniemulsion. \n\nOnly in 2014, the first papers portraying the synthesis of linear polymers \n\nthrough thiol-ene polymerization were published.  \n\nLobry et al. (2014) published a short communication reporting \n\nthe synthesis of linear poly(thioether) nanoparticles via thiol-ene \n\nphotopolymerization in miniemulsion in a continuous-flow \n\nmicroreactor. Co-monomers used were ethylene glycol dithiol and \n\ndiallyl adipate. Hexadecane was used as co-estabilizer against \n\ndiffusional degradation and sodium dodecyl sulphate was used as \n\nsurfactant. A thermal analysis of the produced polymer through DSC \n\nrevealed a glass transition temperature (Tg) of \u2013 63 \u00b0C and a melting \n\ntemperature (Tm) of 18 \u00b0C. The polymer was insoluble in most organic \n\nsolvents due to its high crystallinity (55%) and therefore the authors \n\ncharacterised the molecular weight only for the soluble part (M n = \n\n30 kDa). \n\nJasinski et al. (2014) presented a complete work regarding the \nsynthesis of linear poly(thioether) nanoparticles in miniemulsion using \n\nethylene glycol dithiol and diallyl adipate as co-monomers.  Thiol-ene \n\nphotopolymerization in miniemulsion yielded a poly(thioesther-ester) \n\n58\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nlatex with average particle size of 130 nm. Calorimetric analyses \n\nshowed a Tg of \u2013 63 \u00b0C and a semicrystalline behaviour (degree of \n\ncrystallinity = 55%) indicated by an endothermic melting peak at 18 \u00b0C \n\nand an exothermic recrystallization peak at 6 \u00b0C.  \n\nAmato et al. (2015) synthesized cross-linked polythioether \n\nnanoparticles through thiol-ene photopolymerization in miniemulsion. \n\nAmato et al. investigated the effects of surfactant concentration, organic \n\nphase weight percentage and the influence of the co-stabilizer in thiol-\n\nene miniemulsions. In addition, by performing non-stoichiometric thiol-\n\nene polymerizations nanoparticles containing either thiol or ene \n\nfunctional groups on the surface, depending on which monomer was in \n\nexcess, were obtained. These surface functional groups were utilized for \n\npost-polymerization modifications; fluorescent markers were attached to \n\nthe surface. Polythioether nanoparticles with ene surface groups \n\nunderwent radical-mediated thiol-ene addition with 7-mercapto-4-\n\nmethylcoumarin (blue marker), and nanoparticles with thiol surface \n\ngroups underwent thiol-ene Michael addition with Texas Red maleimide \n\n(red marker). Post-polymerization modified nanoparticles were analysed \n\nvia fluorescence microscopy. \n\nAt first glance, thiol-ene polymerization in miniemulsion, as free-\n\nradical reactions that follows through step-growth mechanism, might \n\npresent kinetic characteristics very different from traditional free-radical \n\nminiemulsion polymerization. Few works have been published \n\nregarding thiol-ene bulk polymerization  (CRAMER; BOWMAN, 2001; \n\nCRAMER et al., 2003; COLE; JANKOUSKY; BOWMAN, 2013). \n\nCramer et al. (2003) stated that in thiol-ene polymerization complicating \n\nkinetic factors from diffusion controlled reactions or early gelation are \n\nnot as significant as in traditional chain growth systems because thiol-\n\nene systems do not exhibit conventional auto-acceleration behaviour and \n\ndo not gel until high conversions are obtained due to their step-growth \n\nnature. However, many other important factors, such as the average \n\nnumber of radicals per particle, nucleation mechanism and solubility of \n\nthe monomer(s) in the aqueous phase are relevant to miniemulsion \n\npolymerization kinetics (SCHORK et al., 2005). \nFurthermore, in thiol-ene co-polymerizations in miniemulsion \n\nwhere thiol and ene monomers possibly will present different solubility \n\ntowards water, co-monomer composition in the polymerization locus, \n\ni.e. inside the droplets, might be quite different from the overall co-\n\nmonomer composition; and since thiol-ene reactions are very sensible to \n\nfunctional group ratio (thiol:ene) this could be a serious hindrance to \n\novercome. \n\n59\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2 FINAL CONSIDERATIONS \n \n\nMiniemulsion polymerization has become an important technique \n\nin the past decades due to its versatility. Many types of materials can be \n\nsynthesized through miniemulsion polymerization and the application \n\nrange is vast.  \n\nHistorically, the synthesis of aqueous polymer dispersions has \n\nfocused on radical chain-growth polymerization of low-cost acrylate or \n\nstyrene emulsions. In addition, step-growth polymerization to produce \n\npolyesters and polyurethanes were also performed in miniemulsion. \n\nThiol-ene step-growth polymerization in miniemulsion is being \n\ncurrently investigated and only a handful of articles have been published \n\nin the literature. Thiol-ene polymerization is a click reaction that has \n\nbeen utilized for many applications from UV-curable coatings to \n\nbiomedicine. In addition, thiol-ene polymerization has been remarkably \n\nutilized to produce polymers from fully renewable diene monomers that \n\nare usually derived from fatty acids and therefore provide potential \n\ndegradability properties to the polymer. The prospective of obtaining \n\nhigh molecular weight polyesters in aqueous dispersed medium is, per \n\nse, a great advantage in performing thiol-ene polymerization in \n\nminiemulsion. In addition, henceforth many other types of interesting \n\nmaterials could be obtained, e.g. nanocomposites, nanocapsules, hybrid \n\nparticles and so on.  \n\n  \n\n60\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n?Complications arose, ensued, were overcome.? \n\n(Jack Sparrow, 2006)\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER V \n \n\n5 RENEWABLE RESOURCES DERIVED POLY (ESTER-\n\nTHIOETHER) NANOPARTICLES AND CAPSULES VIA \n\nTHIOL-ENE POLYMERIZATION IN MINIEMULSION  \n\n \n5.1 INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nThis chapter presents the experimental procedure and the results \n\nand discussion of the synthesis of a fully renewable diene diester \n\nmonomer (derived from castor oil and isosorbide) and its \n\ncopolymerization with butanedithiol via thiol-ene polymerization in \n\nminiemulsion to yield poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles. Step-growth \n\npolymerization normally comprises water-sensitive precursors \n\n(polyurethane) or water byproduct (polyester) leading to equilibrium \n\nprocesses. Polyurethanes are produced based on water-sensitive \n\nprecursors (isocyanates), their reaction with water generates polyurea, \n\nand in aqueous dispersed medium this leads to the formation of \n\npolyurea-urethane; urea moieties possess lower molecular weight than \n\nurethane moieties causing an overall decrease in the molecular weight. \n\nIn addition, synthesis of polyester involves the formation of water as \n\nbyproduct and thus synthesis of polyester in aqueous dispersed medium \n\nleads to low yield and low molecular weight due to chemical \n\nequilibrium. Although their implementation in aqueous dispersed \n\nmedium has proven to be feasible, peculiar conditions are required to \n\navoid poor yields and low molecular weights (BARR\u00c8RE; \n\nLANDFESTER, 2003; VAL\u00c9RIO; ARA\u00daJO; SAYER, 2013; \n\nVAL\u00c9RIO et al., 2014).  \n\nIn this work, the synthesis of poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles \n\nvia thiol-ene step-growth polymerization in miniemulsion is presented. \n\nThiol-ene polymerization in miniemulsion is a field still underexplored \n\nand poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles have prospective applications as \n\nbiodegradable biomaterial. \n\n \n\n5.2 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE \n\n \n\n5.2.1 Materials \n\n \n\n10-Undecenoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%, CAS: 112-38-9), \n\ndianhydro-D-glucitol (Aldrich, 98%, CAS: 652-67-5), p-toluenesulfonic \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nacid monohydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, 98.5%, CAS: 6192-52-5), sodium \n\ndodecyl sulfate (SDS, Vetec, CAS: 151-21-3), potassium persulphate \n\n(KPS, Vetec, 99%, CAS: 7727-21-1), azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN, \n\nVetec, 98%, CAS: 78-67-1), Lutensol AT80 (Lut.

All materials \n\nwere used as received except for AIBN that was recrystallized. Distilled \n\nwater was used in all experiments. \n\n \n\n5.2.2 Dianhydro-D-glucityl diundec-10-enoate (DGU) Synthesis \n \n\n60 g of 10-undecenoic acid (purity: 98%, 318.9 mmol), 16.08 g of \n\n1,4 dianhydro-D-glucitol  (purity: 98%, 107.8 mmol) and 3 g (15.7 \n\nmmol) of p-toluensulfonic acid were placed in a round-bottomed flask \n\nwith magnetic stirrer and a Dean-Stark apparatus. Then, 200 mL of \n\ntoluene were added and the resulting reaction mixture was heated to \n\nreflux, up to 135\u00b0C. Water was collected as the reaction proceeded and \n\nonce the reaction was completed, the reaction mixture was allowed to \n\ncool down. Figure 10 shows a scheme of the esterification reaction. \n\nToluene was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was \n\nfiltered through a short pad of basic aluminium oxide followed by a \n\nshort pad of silica gel 60 using hexane as eluent. After removing the \n\nhexane, the crude product was dissolved in diethyl ether (200 mL), \n\nwashed twice with 1N NaHCO3 solution (200 mL) and once with water \n\n(200 mL) from reverse osmosis. The organic fraction was dried with \n\nanhydrous MgSO4 and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. \n\nThe resulting product was subjected to thin-layer chromatography over \n\nsilica gel and eluted with mixtures of hexane/diethyl ether (7:1) and \n\nhexane/diethyl ether (8:2).  \n\n \n\n64\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10.

One single drop of the diluted latex (0.5% of \n\nsolid content) was placed on an either carbon-coated or parlodium-\n\ncoated copper grid and it was dried under room conditions overnight. \n\nAnalyses were performed in the Laborat\u00f3rio Central de Microscopia \n\nEletr\u00f4nica (LCME), Federal University of Santa Catarina. \n\n \n\n5.3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n \n\n5.3.1 Synthesis and characterisation of a fully renewable monomer \n\nderived from castor oil and isosorbide \n\n \n\nA fully renewable diene diester monomer, Dianhydro-D-glucityl \n\ndiundec-10-enoate (DGU), was produced through esterification in \n\norganic solvent (toluene) of 10-undecenoic acid (derived from castor \n\noil) and isosorbide (derived from starch). Fokou and Meier (2009) \n\nreported the synthesis of this same diene monomer structure through a \n\ndifferent, more complex, synthetic route. Fokou and Meier utilized DGU \n\nfor metathesis polymerization and obtained number average molecular \n\nweight up to 8400 with experiments carried out at 80\u00b0C for 5 h using \n\nsecond generation Grubbs metathesis catalyst; herein, the diene \n\nmonomer is used for thiol-ene polymerization in miniemulsion.  \n\n70\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 12 shows the characteristic \n1\nH NMR spectrum of DGU, \n\ncharacterised as follows: \n1\nH-NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3, ?): 5.81-5.74 (m, 2H, 2x-CH=CH2), \n\n5.16 (d, 1H, -COO-CH-), 5.11 (q, 1H, -COO-CH-), 4.98-4.89 (m, 4H, \n\n2x-CH=CH2), 4.79 (t, 1H, -CH2 -O-CH-), 4.43 (d, 1H, -CH2-O-CH-), \n\n3.97-3.94 (dd, 1H, -CH2-O-CH-), 3.93-3.89 (m, 2H, -CH2-O- CH-), 3.76 \n\n(dd, 1H, -CH2-O-CH-), 2.33 (t, 2H, CH2COO-), 2.27 (t, 2H, CH2COO-), \n\n2.00 (q, 4H, 2xCH2-CH=CH2), 1.63- 1.53 (m, 4H, 2xCH2CH2COO-), \n\n1.36-1.31 (m, 4H, 2xCH2) 1.29-1.23 (br.s, 16H, 2x[4CH2]) ppm. \n\n \n\nIn addition, FTIR spectrum from DGU in Figure 13 is in \n\nagreement with the anticipated structure. Peaks in 3076 cm\n-1\n\n, 1640 cm\n-1\n\n \n\nand 910 cm\n- 1\n\n correspond respectively to =C\u2013H stretch in the unsaturated \n\nhydrocarbon chain, C=C stretch and CH2 out-of-plane wag from \n\nCH=CH2 in vinyl compounds. A shoulder at 2977 cm\n-1\n\n corresponding to \n\nene groups can also be observed. At 2930 cm\n1\n one can observe a peak \n\ncorrespondent to CH antisymmetric and symmetric stretching from \u2013\n\nCH3 and \u2013CH2\u2013 in aliphatic moieties. At 2850 cm\n-1\n\n, it is presented CH \n\nstretching modes from \u2013CH3 attached to oxygen. The very strong peak \n\nat 1740 cm\n-1\n\n indicates C=O stretch in esters. Peaks at 1162 cm\n-1\n\n and \n\n1095 cm\n-1\n\n stand for respectively C-O-C antisymmetric stretch in esters \n\nand C-O-C stretch in ethers. CH2 out-of-plane wag from HC=CH2 in \n\nvinyl compounds shows up at 910 cm\n-1\n\n. Moreover, it was not detected \n\nany \u2013OH peak referent to water or 10-undecoic acid. \n \n\nFigure 12.

This attempt was not \n\nadopted in this work in order to achieve a fair comparison between \n\ndifferent types of initiator (AIBN and KPS). However, gravimetric \n\nanalyses revealed a Bu(SH)2 conversion of at least 35 % and 10 % after \n\nsonication when, respectively, AIBN and KPS were utilized; plus an \n\ninitiatorless attempt evidenced a 10% conversion owe to polymerization \n\nduring sonication. \n\nSamples using non-ionic surfactants M1 and M2 showed \n\nconsiderable difference between droplet and particle sizes. For sample \n\nM3 with the anionic surfactant SDS the difference between droplet and \n\nparticle size as well as dispersion before and after polymerization is less \n\nthan 10% and therefore can be neglected. Lut. AT50 yielded higher \n\ndroplet and particles sizes than Lut AT80. SDS provided the lowest \n\nparticle size and the narrowest PSD. There are two explanations for the \n\nobserved results. Firstly, Lut. AT80 possesses a higher molecular weight \n\nand a higher surface coverage per mole unit \u2013 as it normally happens for \n\nnon-ionic surfactants when their chain/molecular weight is increased \u2013 \n\nthan Lut AT50 (HOLMBERG et al., 2002). Thus a higher quantity of \nLut. AT 50 \u2013 which possesses molecular weight 1.5 times lower (see \n\nTable 7) \u2013 is needed for a similar system to be obtained in order to \n\nbalance number of moles of surfactant and surface coverage. Secondly, \n\neven though SDS provides lower surface coverage, differently from \n\nnon-ionic surfactants, it provides electrostatic stabilisation to the \n\ndroplets/nanoparticles, a powerful mechanism to avoid loss of colloidal \n\nstability. \n\n \nTable 7.

As expected, lower average particle sizes and narrower particle \n\nsize distributions were obtained with the increase of the surfactant \n\n74\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nconcentration.

Figure16a shows \n\npoly DGU-Bu(SH)2 nanoparticles stabilised with SDS. It is important to \n\nmention that, herein, it is presented the first TEM images of thiol-ene \n\nlinear polymers sub-micrometric particles, specifically poly (ester-\n\nthioether). \n\n \n\n \n\nThe morphology of non-cross-linked polymer particles with low \n\nglass transition temperature and low melting point (<100\u00b0C) are not \n\nvery often successfully analysed by TEM, except in cases when cryo-\n\nTEM is available. Nonetheless, the morphology of poly (DGU-Bu(SH)2) \n\nparticles was effectively visualized when TEM equipment was operated \n\nat the lowest current possible, which in its turn provides low image \nresolution. Polymeric particles melted during the microscopy session \n\nwhen the current was increased in order to obtain better images; Figure \n\n16 compares the same particles before (a) and after melting (b). \n\n \n\nFigure 15.

Furthermore, TEM analyses corroborate DLS \n\nresults, that even though there is a majority of small particles, a \n\npopulation of macroparticles is also existent and draws more attention in \n\nTEM images due to their bigger size and easier visualization.  \n\nPolymerization reactions were carried out under different \n\nconditions, such as reaction time, temperature, and amount of initiator, \n\nto evaluate the effect on molecular weight distribution. Thiol-ene \n\npolymerization is an unique reaction that combines both step-growth \n\nand free-radical mechanisms (HOYLE; LEE; ROPER, 2004; HOYLE; \n\nBOWMAN, 2010), therefore it was expected to obtain higher average \n\nmolecular weights for higher functional groups conversion, which \n\nincreases with the time of the reaction. Table 8 shows the average \n\nmolecular weight and the molecular weight dispersion (MW/MN) for 4, 6 \n\nand 8 h of polymer samples synthesized via bulk polymerization (B \n\nsamples) at 70\u00b0C and using 1 mol% of AIBN in relation to Bu(SH)2.  \n\n \nTable 8.

Ideally, functional group conversion should increase \n\nwith time and by consequence the degree of polymerization; however, \n\nmany are the issues such as the increase in viscosity that causes low \n\nmobility of growing polymer chains that affect directly functional group \n\nconversion and restrict the degree of polymerization.  \n\nA set of polymerization experiments were carried out at different \n\ntemperatures (see Table 9), ranging from 60 to 90\u00b0C, for 4 h. Both bulk \n\nand miniemulsion polymerizations used 1 mol% of AIBN in relation to \n\nBu(SH)2. Figure 17 and Figure 18 display miniemulsion \n\npolymerizations and bulk polymerizations obtained molecular weight \n\ndistribution in terms of the normalized signal vs. retention time from \n\nGPC. In Figure 17, correspondent to miniemulsion polymerization, \n\nmolecular weight distribution curves are closer than in Figure 18, \n\ncorrespondent to bulk polymerization, and therefore apparently \n\nmolecular weight distribution is less sensitive to temperature in \n\nminiemulsion than in bulk polymerization.  \n \n\nTable 9.

This indicates that at some extent \n\nthere is an effect of radical compartmentalization, which in its turn \n\noccurs when a single radical is confined to the droplet and thus \n\nbimolecular termination (Figure 6) is supressed (LANDFESTER, 2003). \n\nAt 60\u00b0C, the initiator half-life is about 20h (Eq. 11) and, therefore, \n\npolymerization reaction occurs virtually with no initiator decomposition; \n\nthus there is no difference in molecular weight of the samples from both \n\nbulk and miniemulsion polymerizations. \n\n \n  \n\n78\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 18. .

Nevertheless, at 90 \u00b0C a decrease in MN was \n\nobserved. Firstly, rate constants \u2013 from initiator decomposition (kd), \n\npropagation (kp), chain-transfer (kct), and termination (kt) \u2013 are \n\ntemperature-dependent. Constant rates dependence from different \n\npolymerization steps behave differently towards temperature. It could \n\nmean that, for example, at 90 \u00b0C kt becomes much higher than kct. In \n\naddition, thiol-ene polymerization is a step-growth polymerization that \n\nproceeds as free radical reactions and therefore it needs to undergo \n\ninitiation (Figure 5). In step-growth polymerizations, molecular weight \n\ndepends on functional group conversion, which in its turn depends on \n\ntemperature. As thiol-ene polymerization combines both step-growth \n\nand free radical mechanisms; it is reasonable to consider that with the \n\nincrease in temperature the initiator decomposes at a faster rate and thus \n\nfunctional groups are allowed to react faster and the degree of \n\npolymerization is enhanced because more thiyl radicals are being \n\ngenerated. \n\nThus, based on the displayed results, 80\u00b0C is the temperature \n\ncondition that provided the highest molecular weight results for both \n\nminiemulsion and bulk polymerization.  \n\n79\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nReaction conditions were fixed at 4 h and 80\u00b0C also because of \n\nthe half-life of AIBN in order to test the effects of other parameters. In \n\nfree-radical polymerization, various initiators are used depending on \n\ntheir rates of decomposition. The decomposition of initiators can be \n\nconveniently expressed in terms of the initiator half-life (t1/2), which is \n\ndefined as the time for the concentration of initiator to decrease to one \n\nhalf of its original value (ODIAN, 2009). The decomposition constant of \n\nAIBN in toluene is given by the Eq. (10) (BRANDRUP et al., 1999): \n \n\n  ( \n  )               (\n\n       \n\n         ( )\n)   (10) \n\n \n\nand its half-life is given by: \n\n \n\n  \n \n\n( )  \n   \n \n\n \n\n   \n      (11) \n\n \n\nTherefore, at 80 \u00b0C and considering toluene as solvent, \n\n    (AIBN) is 1.4 h, this way a reaction time of 4 h means that roughly \n\n7/8 of the AIBN would have been decomposed. \n\nTable 10 shows the effect of different particle sizes on the \n\naverage molecular weight of thiol-ene polymerization in miniemulsion \n\nat 80 \u00b0C using 1 mol% of AIBN (in relation to Bu(SH)2) as initiator. As \nit is shown in Table 10, number-average molecular weight seems to \n\nreach a peak value as average particle size approaches 190 nm when \n\nthiol:ene ratio is 1:1 (M3). Non-stoichiometric experiments (M11, M12) \n\nwere performed in order to observe the effect in molecular weight and if \n\nthe molecular weight would respond to the change in the particle size \n\nsimilarly to its behaviour in stoichiometric reactions (M1, M3, M10). \n\n \nTable 10.

On the \n\nother hand, a significant increase in the droplet size might make \n\nbimolecular termination more likely to occur due to the higher content \n\nof radicals inside the droplet. In traditional miniemulsion systems \n\nradical compartmentalization leads to faster polymerization rates and \n\nhigher molecular weights (LANDFESTER, 2003 COSTA et al., 2013). \nOn the other hand, thiol-ene polymerization in miniemulsion not only \n\ndepends on average number of radicals per particle but mainly of the \n\nstoichiometry. Therefore, there is a radical compartmentalization effect \n\nas long as the stoichiometry in the polymerization locus is not \n\ncompromised. \n\nMiniemulsion polymerization is a heterophase technique, which \n\nmeans that the components are partitioned between organic and aqueous \n\nphases, especially those compounds that possess a significant solubility \n\nin the both phases, which is the case of the 1,4-butanedithiol. This \n\npartition between the two phases may change local stoichiometry inside \n\nthe droplet, the polymerization locus, which may be accounted for the \n\nobserved results because thiol-ene polymerization is intrinsically reliant \n\non the stoichiometry (CRAMER et al., 2003). \nThe observed effect can be explained by the great difference in \n\ninterfacial area inflicted by the change in droplet/particle diameter. Thiyl \n\nradicals are mostly produced inside the droplet because AIBN is an \n\norgano-soluble initiator. However, Bu(SH)2 has a significant solubility \n\nin water (1.32 mg\u00b7mL\n-1\n\n), close to the solubility of MMA in water, and \n\ntherefore Bu(SH)2, and consequently thiyl radicals, are able to leave the \n\ndroplet to the water phase. An increase in interfacial area means that \n\nmore radicals are capable of leaving the droplet to the water phase and \n\nconsequently the composition inside the droplet is changed. Thiol-ene \n\nstep-growth polymerization is strictly dependent on the functional group \n\nratio, non-stoichiometric reactions are known to significantly reduce \n\nfunctional group conversion in thiol-ene photopolymerization \n\n(CRAMER; BOWMAN, 2001; CRAMER et al., 2003) and therefore the \n\n81\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nmolecular weight is also reduced as observed when comparing reactions \n\nM3 to M11 and M10 to M12. \n\nThe influence of the type and the amount of initiator were \n\nevaluated. Table 11 displays number average and weight average \n\nmolecular weight results of miniemulsion and bulk polymerizations \n\nwhere AIBN (organo-soluble) and KPS (water-soluble) were used as \n\ninitiators in different concentrations (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 mol%).

As for KPS, it was observed a decline in \n\nmolecular weight with the increase in initiator concentration just as \n\nhappens in traditional free radical polymerization (ODIAN, 2009). \n\nFigures 19, 20 and 21 show the molecular weight distributions of the \nsamples from Table 11.

Even initiator concentration effects on \n\nkinetics are not well explored; most of the works (CRAMER et al., \n\n2003; NORTHROP; COFFEY, 2012) focus on thiols and enes with \n\ndifferent functionalities and thiol\u2013to-ene ratios. However, a \n\npaper (COLE; JANKOUSKY; BOWMAN, 2013) evaluates the \n\ninfluence of initiator concentration in the kinetics of redox initiated \n\nthiol-ene bulk polymerization, but only functional groups conversion \n\nwas evalueated. \n\n \n\n83\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 20.

In \n\ntraditional free radical polymerization, molecular weight is directly \n\ndependent of the amount of initiator, the higher the concentration the \n\nlower the molecular weight; and this behaviour is observed independent \n\non the type of the initiator, water or organo-soluble. However, in thiol-\n\nene polymerization a different behaviour is observed. AIBN provided \n\nthe best molecular weight result at the concentration of 1 mol%, \n\nconcentrations of 0.5, 1.5 and 2 mol% resulted in lower molecular \n\nweight for both miniemulsion and bulk polymerization. In its turn, KPS \n\nbehaved exactly the way is considered common in free radical \n\npolymerizations, the lower the concentration the higher the molecular \n\nweight. The precise explanation for the observed results might be \n\nobtained through further kinetic experiments. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n84\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 21.

The synthesized \n\npoly(thioether-ester)s presented a double-melting behaviour observed in \n\nsemicrystalline polymers (HIRAKAWA; HIRAMATSU, 1980; YU et \n\nal., 1983; YASUNIWA et al., 2004). The lower temperature peak is due \n\nto the partial melting and recrystallization of the imperfect crystallite, \n\nwhilst the higher temperature peak corresponds to the melting of the \n\nbetter-organised crystallite (YU et al., 1983). It was observed a slight \nvariation in the temperature of melt according to molecular weight of \n\nminiemulsion samples, i.e. samples with lower molecular weight had \n\ntheir melting peak shifted to the left and therefore indicating a melting \n\ntemperature a few degrees lower (see Figure 22).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n85\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 22.

It may be possible, however, \n\nto determine the TG through relaxation methods such as dynamic \n\nmechanical and dielectric spectroscopies as reported (FOCARETE et \n\nal., 2001) by other authors who worked with highly crystalline \npolymers. The crystallinity observed in these poly(thioether-ester)s is an \n\neffect of intra- and intermolecular interactions between functional \n\ngroups, and a highly linear structure. It is important to notice that it was \n\nnot possible to determine the degree of crystallinity through DSC due to \n\nthe lack of data about the polymer such as the enthalpy of a fully \n\ncrystalline reference or an exothermic recrystallization event. The \n\nmethod used by calculating the degree of crystallinity through Eq. 9 \n\nbased on the peaks from XRD gives a fair approach, even though it is \n\n86\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ndifficult to draw an amorphous halo unambiguously.

(2014a) also reported the synthesis of \n\npoly(thioether-ester) with a high degree of crystallinity (55%) through \n\nthiol-ene polymerization in miniemulsion. They observed the \n\nsemicrystalline behaviour revealed by an exothermic recrystallization \n\npeak at 6\u00b0C and an endothermic melting peak at 18\u00b0C. \n\nPolymers comprising a high degree of crystallinity are interesting \n\nbecause it plays a large role on the thermal, mechanical, and other \n\nimportant properties of polymers. The extent of crystallinity developed \n\nin a polymer sample is a consequence of both thermodynamic and \n\nkinetic factors (ODIAN, 2009). \n\n \n\n5.3.4 The effect of co-stabilizers and their possible use as liquid core \n\n \n\nCrodamol GTCC and hexadecane were tested as co-stabilizers. \n\nThey were added in a concentration of 10% (w.% in relation to the \n\nmonomers) to miniemulsion whose formulations contained 12 \n\nmmol\u00b7cm\n-3\n\n of Lutensol AT50. Figure 25 shows the particle size \n\ndistribution for the latex containing 10% of either HD or Crodamol. The \n\naddition of either co-stabilizers yielded lower average particle size and \n\nnarrower size distribution in comparison to M2 (Table 6) by preventing \n\nthe Ostwald ripening. However, PSD results from previous \n\nminiemulsion experiments also indicates that depending on surfactant \n\ntype and concentration there is no need for co-stabilizers because DGU \n\nis sufficiently hydrophobic to provide some diffusional stability. \n\nCo-stabilizer concentrations were further increased to 50% in an \n\nattempt to produce nanocapsules. The amount of water was increased in \n\norder to maintain the weight ratio between organic and aqueous phases. \n\nSamples containing 50% of co-stabilizer, M19 and M20, presented an \n\nincrease of roughly 15 nm in the average particle size though size \n\ndistribution dispersion was preserved.

However, it has been verified through DSC \n\n(Figure 26b) that there is not any peak for the melting of Crodamol for \n\nminiemulsion polymerization when using Crodamol as co-stabilizer \n\n(M20, Table 13) at the same concentration (50 w.%) as hexadecane. The \n\napparent melting temperature of the sample containing Crodamol \n\n(Figure 26b (M20)) has decreased from 66 to 63 \u00b0C. In addition, the \n\npartition of the double Tm peaks is not as clear as in the pure polymeric \n\nsample. Furthermore, the enthalpy of melting (?Hm) of the polymer \n\nsample synthesized with Crod. as co-stabilizer is 23 J\u00b7g\n-1\n\n; whilst a \n\npolymer synthesized similarly but without co-stabilizer has ?Hm = 42 \n\nJ\u00b7g\n-1\n\n. This means that the addition of 50 w.% of Crodamol (in relation to \nthe monomers) to the formulation reduced crystalline domains by half \n\napproximately. Therefore, DSC results indicate that phase separation did \n\nnot occur and Crodamol is most likely solubilized in the polymeric \n\nmatrix. due to the formation of the homogeneous mixture polymer-\n\nCrodamol. Some other analytical techniques can be useful to further \n\n91\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ninvestigate the internal structure of nanoparticles such as TEM of \n\nmicrotomed samples and solid state NMR (STUBBS; SUNDBERG, \n\n2005). In addition, tension interface measurements between \n\npolymer/water phase, polymer/HD, polymer/Crod., HD/water phase, \n\nand Crod./water phase would help to figure out how phases behave in \n\nthe nanostructure. \n\n \n\n5.3.5 Thiol-ene polymerization kinetics in miniemulsion \n \n\nThiol-ene polymerization kinetics in miniemulsion of DGU and \n\nBu(SH)2 was investigated using either AIBN or KPS as initiators. Both \n\ninitiators were tested in the same concentrations of 1 mol% in relation to \n\nthe dithiol monomer in experiments carried out at 80\u00b0C. Gravimetric \n\nconversions of Bu(SH)2 higher than 85% were obtained within 15 \n\nminutes of reaction. Moreover, dried latex samples were submitted to \n\nFTIR analyses with the intention of quantifying the double bonds of the \n\nresidual diene monomer. However, samples taken after 15 minutes of \n\nreaction did not display any measurable double bond peak in FTIR \n\nspectra. \n\nFTIR spectra of dried latexes taken at 0 min. and 20 min. of \n\npolymerization are presented in Figure 27 for the polymerization using \n\nAIBN and in Figure 28 for polymerization using KPS. Both experiments \n\nwere carried out at 80\u00b0C with 1 mol% of either AIBN or KPS and \n\nthiol:ene 1:1. \n\n \n\n92\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 27.

The comparison evidenced rapid consumption of double bonds \n\n(1640 cm\n-1\n\n) and the formation of sulphide bonds (720 cm\n-1\n\n). \n\n \n \n\nIt can be noticed in Figure 27 that peaks at 3076 cm\n-1\n\n and 910 cm\n-\n\n 1\n, that correspond respectively to =C\u2014H stretch in the unsaturated \n\nhydrocarbon chain and CH2 out-of-plane wag from CH=CH2 in vinyl \n\ncompounds, no longer are discernible in Figure 27 when compared to \n\nFigure 13. A very small peak at 1640 cm\n-1\n\n (C=C stretch) can be seen in \n\nFigure 27 in the curve correspondent to the sample taken at the \n\nbeginning of the polymerization (0 min.), however for the sample taken \n\nat 20 min. no peak can be seen at 1640 cm\n-1\n\n. Samples were not washed \n\nprior to the FTIR analyses, which means that the peaks correspondent to \n\ndouble bonds are most likely due to the presence of residual DGU. \n\nFurthermore, it can be noticed the presence of sulphide bonds (S\u2014C) at \n\n720 cm\n-1\n\n in the sample resultant from the addition of the thiyl radicals \n\nacross the double bond. \n\nA similar behaviour can be observed in Figure 28 correspondent \n\nto the thiol-ene polymerization in miniemulsion with KPS. However, \n\nKPS provided a slower kinetics and therefore at the beginning of the \n\npolymerization (0 min.) a strong peak at 910 cm\n-1\n\n (indicated in Figure 28 \n\nby a black arrow) can still be noticed, and corresponding to =C\u2014H \n\n93\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nstretch in the unsaturated hydrocarbon chain of DGU.

However, for the sample taken at 20 min. no \n\npeak can be seen at 1640 cm\n-1\n\n and the strong peak at 910 cm\n-1\n\n cannot be \n\nseen. In addition, it can be noticed (20 min.) the presence of sulphide \n\nbonds (S\u2014C) at 720 cm\n-1\n\n in the sample resultant from the addition of \n\nthe thiyl radicals across the double bond. \n\nFigure 28.

The increase of molecular \n\nweight with reaction time is a characteristic of step-growth \npolymerizations. It is important to notice that even though FTIR (Figure \n\n27) does not indicate any measurable peak of double bonds after 20 \n\nminutes, molecular weight still increases until 200 minutes of reaction. \n\nThis is probably because there are sufficient double bonds associated to \n\n94\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\noligomers to keep polymer growth but not many DGU single molecules, \n\nif any; and thus double bond signal is insignificant toward other \n\nfunctional groups present in the macromolecule. \n\n \nFigure 29.

Probably \n\nFTIR technique is not sensitive enough to pick up residual double bond \n\npeaks in macromolecules such as oligomers and polymers. \n\nIt is not clear the reason why KPS provides a much lower, half \n\napproximately, molecular weight than AIBN. KPS, being a water-\n\nsoluble ionic compound, only forms radicals in aqueous phase and this \n\nmight be favourable to thiyl-thiyl termination (Figure 6) to form \n\ndisulphide in the water even before thiyl radicals could enter the \n\ndroplets. On the other hand, AIBN, being an organo-soluble initiator, \n\nfavours droplet nucleation (LANDFESTER, 2003).  \n \n\n5.4 FINAL CONSIDERATIONS \n \n\nHerein, thiol-ene polymerization was utilized to synthesize \n\npoly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles through miniemulsion \n\npolymerization using a fully renewable monomer (DGU) indirectly \n\nderived from vegetable oil and sugar. Different parameters were tested: \n\nreaction temperature, reaction time, initiator concentration, and \n\nsurfactant type and concentration, and the addition of co-stabilizer. \n\nLattices did not present great difference regarding stability or particle \n\ndiameter when co-stabilizer were added to the formulation, noticeable \n\nincrease in particle size was observed only when co-stabilizers were \n\nused at high weight percentage (50%). In general, by increasing the \n\ntemperature higher molecular weight was obtained probably due to \n\nfunctional group conversion since thiol-ene follows step-growth \n\nmechanism. In addition, AIBN (organo-soluble initiator) was found to \n\npresent an ideal concentration among the tested concentrations to \n\nimprove molecular weight, while when KPS (water soluble initiator) is \n\nused a decrease in initiator concentration enhances molecular weight. \n\nMoreover, AIBN provided polymeric samples with higher molecular \n\nweight than KPS. .Particle morphology was observed by TEM. Particle \n\nsize was   200 nm and particle size dispersion ? 0.2. The best results \nregarding molecular weight (MN up to 11 kDa) were obtained through \n\nminiemulsion polymerization at 80\u00b0C using AIBN at 1% (mol% in \n\n96\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nrelation to dithiol) Furthermore, DSC and XRD analyses showed that \n\nthe synthesized polymer is semi-crystalline with a degree of crystallinity \n\nof at least 20% and temperature of melting around 60\u00b0C. Finally, \n\nnanoparticles with a co-stabilizer liquid phase, possibly liquid core, \n\nwere obtained and phase separation was observed through DSC. In \n\nfuture works the kinetics of thiol-ene polymerization in miniemulsion \n\nshould be investigated to evaluate phenomena such as radical \n\ncompartmentalization and the development of molecular weight with \n\nreaction time. Also thiol-ene miniemulsion polymerization of DGU \n\ncould be used to synthesize nanocapsules of active compounds. Lastly, \n\nnanoparticles derived from renewable resources synthesized herein \n\npossess hydrolysable bonds in the main polymeric chain and therefore \n\nthe (bio) degradation of the poly(DGU-Bu(SH)2) could be investigated. \n \n\n  \n\n97\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER VI \n \n\n6 FINAL CONSIDERATIONS \n \n\n6.1 CONCLUSION \n\n \n\nIn this work, it was reported the synthesis of a renewable ?,?-\n\ndiene diester monomer, dianhydro-D-glucityl diundec-10-enoate \n\n(DGU), produced from 10-undecenoic acid (derived from castor oil) and \n\nisosorbide (derived from starch). DGU was copolymerized with 1,4-\n\nbutanedithiol (Bu(SH)2) through thiol-ene polymerization both in bulk \n\nand miniemulsion to yield linear semi-crystalline poly(thioether-ester)s. \n\nDifferent parameters were evaluated such as reaction temperature, \n\ninitiator concentration, and surfactant type and concentration. \n\nThe synthesis of novel monomers from bio-feedstock was \n\nevidenced to be a powerful tool to produce differentiated polymers with \n\nprospective for diverse applications. Brazil, as one of the world\u2018s \n\nbiggest producers of vegetable oil, possesses a great potential to develop \n\nsustainable chemistry based products using vegetable oils as raw \n\nmaterials. \n\nDGU was successfully copolymerized with Bu(SH)2 via thiol-ene \n\npolymerization both in bulk and in miniemulsion. Polymer obtained by \n\nminiemulsion polymerization resulted in a higher molecular weight \n\nwhen compared to bulk polymerization. Thus, there is evidence of the \n\noccurrence of radical compartmentalization. Poly(thioether-ester) \n\nnanoparticles were obtained through miniemulsion polymerization and \n\nmorphology was evaluated by TEM. Microscopy analyses have shown \n\nspherical nanoparticles. DLS has shown that according to surfactant type \n\nand concentration particles from 130 up to 250 nm can be obtained. \n\nHowever, components are partitioned between organic and aqueous \n\nphases, especially those compounds that possess a significant solubility \n\nin the both phases, which is the case of the 1,4-butanedithiol. This \n\npartition between the two phases may change local stoichiometry inside \n\nthe droplet. As thiol-ene polymerization is strictly dependent of \n\nstoichiometry, this might have been the reason for the decrease in \n\nmolecular weights values when particle size was reduced. Non-\n\nstoichiometric attempts containing a 20% excess of dithiol further \n\nconfirmed that thiol-ene polymerization is reliant on stoichiometry. \n\nIn general, increasing the temperature of the polymerization there \n\nis an increase in molecular weight. thiol-ene polymerization is a step-\n\ngrowth polymerization that proceeds as free radical reactions and \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ntherefore it needs undergo initiation. In step-growth polymerizations, \n\nmolecular weight depends on functional group conversion, with the \n\nincrease in temperature the initiator decomposes at a faster rate and thus \n\nfunctional groups are allowed to react faster and the degree of \n\npolymerization is enhanced because more thiyl radicals are being \n\ngenerated. 80\u00b0C was the temperature condition that provided the best \n\nmolecular weight results for both miniemulsion and bulk \n\npolymerization. \n\nIn traditional free radical polymerization, molecular weight is \n\ndirectly dependent of the amount of initiator, the higher the \n\nconcentration the lower the molecular weight; and this behaviour is \n\nobserved independent on the type of the initiator, water or organo-\n\nsoluble. However, in thiol-ene polymerization a different behaviour for \n\nAIBN was observed, among the concentrations tested, the intermediary \n\nconcentration of 1 mol% presented the best molecular weight result. On \n\nthe other hand, KPS provided its highest molecular result with the \n\nlowest concentration of 0.5 mol%. Furthermore, DSC and XRD analyses \n\nhave shown that the synthesized polymer was semi-crystalline with a \n\ndegree of crystallinity of at least 20% and Tm around 60\u00b0C. In addition, \n\ndepending on the co-stabilizer type, hexadecane of Crodamol, and \n\namount, phase segregation inside the polymer particles was observed \n\nthrough DSC. Finally, thiol-ene polymerization kinetics in miniemulsion \n\nhas shown that even though FTIR does not indicate any measurable \n\npeak of double bonds after 20 minutes, molecular weight still increases \n\nuntil 200 minutes of reaction. It is not clear the reason why KPS \n\nprovides a much lower, half approximately, molecular weight than \n\nAIBN. KPS, being a water-soluble ionic compound, only forms radicals \n\nin aqueous phase and this might be favourable to thiyl-thiyl termination \n\nto form disulphide in the water even before thiyl radicals could enter the \n\ndroplets. On the other hand, AIBN, being an organo-soluble initiator, \n\nfavours droplet nucleation. \n\n \n\n6.2 FURTHER WORK \n\n \n\n1. To synthesize other types of diene monomers. \n2.
