New lithological, \ngeochemical, gamma-ray and potential field data, integrated with \ngeological, isotope and paleomagnetic data are used to characterize this \npulse of Mesoproterozoic extension-related magmatism. The Figueira Branca \nSuite formed through juvenile magma emplacement into the crust at 1425 \nMa, coeval with the later stages of the Santa Helena Orogen. Gabbros and \nperidotite-gabbros display increasing enrichment of LREE, interpreted as \nevidence of progressive fractionation of the magma. Magnetic and gamma-\nray data delimit the extent of magmatism within the suite to four bodies \nto the north of Indiava\u00ed city. Modelling gravity and magnetic field data \nindicate that the anomalous sources are close to the surface or \noutcropping. These intrusions trend northwest over 8 km, with significant \nremanent magnetization that is consistent with published direction \nobtained through paleomagnetic data. The emplacement, mineralogy and \ngeochemical signature point towards a back-arc extension tectonic \nframework in the later stages of the Santa Helena Orogen. \n\nSuggested Reviewers: Clive Foss \nCSIRO \nclive.foss@csiro.au \nHis research on potential field methods, developing modelling \nmethodologies and applying in mining and tectonics. \n\nAmarildo S Ruiz \nUniversidade Federal do Mato Grosso \nasruiz@gmail.com \nResearcher specialist in the Jauru Terrane, southwest Amazon Craton \n\nMauro C Geraldes \nUniversidade Estadual do Rio de Janeiro \ngeraldes@uerj.br \n\n\n\nResearcher specialist in geochronology and geochemistry of the Amazon \nCraton \n\nFabio C Tontini \nGNS Science \nf.caratori.tontini@gns.cri.nz\nResearcher specialist in potential fields modelling and tectonics \n\n\n\nTectonic insights of the Southwest Amazon Craton from geophysical,\n\ngeochemical and mineralogical data of Figueira Branca Mafic-Ultramafic \n\nSuite, Brazil\n\nVinicius Hector Abud Louro, Peter Anthony Cawood, Marta Silvia Maria Mantovani \n\nAbstract \n\n\n\nTectonic insights of the Southwest Amazon Craton from geophysical,\n\ngeochemical and mineralogical data of Figueira Branca Mafic-Ultramafic \n\nSuite, Brazil \n\nVinicius Hector Abud Louro, Peter Anthony Cawood, Marta Silvia Maria Mantovani \n\nGraphical Abstract \n\n\n\nTectonic insights of the Southwest Amazon Craton from geophysical,\n\ngeochemical and mineralogical data of Figueira Branca Mafic-Ultramafic \n\nSuite, Brazil \n\nVinicius Hector Abud Louro, Peter Anthony Cawood, Marta Silvia Maria Mantovani \n\nHighlights \n\n\n\nTectonic insights of the Southwest Amazon Craton from geophysical,\n\ngeochemical and mineralogical data of Figueira Branca Mafic-Ultramafic Suite,\n\nBrazil\n\nVinicius Hector Abud Louro1,2, Peter Anthony Cawood2, Marta Silvia Maria \n\nMantovani1\n\nCorresponding author:\n\nE-mail:\n\n\n\nAbstract \n\nKeywords\n\n\n\n1.

Most involve the juxtaposition of Laurentia and Baltica with Siberia 30\n\noccupying an adjacent or nearby position. But the disposition of other cratonic blocks around 31\n\nthese core elements, or whether they were even part of Nuna, is unresolved. We use magnetic 32\n\nfield data from the global magnetic anomaly map, EMAG2, from the Amazon, Baltic, West 33\n\nAfrican and North China cratons to observe potential continuity of magnetic lineaments and 34\n\nregimes in domains of similar ages within these cratons. On this basis, a permissible early 35\n\nMesoproterozoic configuration of these cratonic fragments involves southwest Baltica 36\n\n(Sarmatia) abutting the northern portion of the Amazon Craton (Maroni-Itacai\u00fanas), whereas 37\n\nthe western or the southern border of West Africa would be close to, or connected with, the 38\n\nnortheast side of the Amazon Craton. This data is consistent with those models that locate the 39\n\nAmazon Craton at the southern end of the main Nuna landmass. 40\n\n41\n\nKeywords42\n\nAmazon Craton, Nuna, Mesoproterozoic, Magnetic Field, EMAG2.43\n\n44\n\n45\n\n46\n\n47\n\n48\n\n49\n\n50\n\n51\n\n52\n\n53\n\n54\n\n\n\n84\n\n1. Introduction55\n\n56\n\nThe location and composition of the Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic supercontinent Nuna, also 57\n\nknown as Columbia and Hudsonland, and its constituent fragments is much debated and a 58\n\nvariety of models, some of which entail mutually exclusive configurations, have been proposed 59\n\n(Evans and Mitchell, 2011; Johansson, 2009; Pisarevsky et al., 2014; Rogers and Santosh, 60\n\n2002; Williams et al., 1991; Zhao et al., 2002; Zhao et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2001).61\n\nUnderstanding the processes of supercontinent amalgamation and breakup, as well as their 62\n\npaleogeographic configuration, provides valuable insights into the evolution of the Earth, 63\n\nincluding the role of Large Igneous Provinces (LIP) (Youbi et al., 2013), their relationship to 64\n\npatterns of ore deposits (Cawood and Hawkesworth, 2015; Pehrsson et al., 2015), and their 65\n\npotential impact on the Earth\u2019s surficial environments, including atmosphere and ocean 66\n\ncomposition and the biosphere (e.g., Cawood and Hawkesworth, 2015, and references therein).67\n\nHistorically, supercontinent reconstructions are based on the integration of one or more datasets 68\n\ninvolving stratigraphic and tectonic correlations, geochemical and isotopic compositions, and 69\n\npaleomagnetic data. In this paper, we evaluate the position of the Amazon Craton in the Nuna 70\n\nsupercontinent using magnetic field data and, in particular, we assess a number of recent 71\n\nreconstructions that highlight the range of Nuna configurations and the datasets used to justify 72\n\nthose configurations, including: (1) Mertanen and Pesonen (2012), which is based on 73\n\npaleomagnetic data; (2) Pisarevsky et al. (2014), based on paleomagnetic and geological 74\n\nconstraints; and (3) Pehrsson et al. (2015) who integrated paleomagnetic and geological data75\n\nwith patterns and features of ore deposit distribution (Fig. 1).  76\n\n77\n\n\n\n85\n\n78\n\nFig. 1 \u2013 Reconstructions of Nuna proposed by (a) Mertanen and Pesonen (2012), (b) 79\n\nPisarevsky et al. (2014), and (c) Pehrsson et al. (2015). 80\n\n81\n\nOur assessment is based on a combination of  Total Magnetic Field, the Amplitude of the 82\n\nAnalytic Signal 3D (Roest et al., 1992), and Tilt data (Verduzco et al., 2004) of the Amazon 83\n\nand potential adjacent cratons, to compare magnetic signature, which along with geologic and 84\n\nage data of these cratons enables us to revaluate proposed Nuna reconstructions. Unfortunately, 85\n\n\n\n86\n\npaleopole data for the Amazon Craton for the relevant period of Nuna assembly is limited: the 86\n\n1420 Ma Indiava\u00ed (D'Agrella-Filho et al., 2012) and Nova Guarita intrusives (Bispo-Santos et 87\n\nal., 2012), and the 1790 Ma Colider (Bispo-Santos et al., 2008) and Avanavero intrusives (Reis 88\n\net al., 2013). The small number of Proterozoic reference poles in the Amazon Craton, as well 89\n\nas West Africa (Pisarevsky et al., 2014), in part reflects the vast area of the Amazon forest90\n\nwith limited access and poor exposure, as well as areas of civilian unrest, or of military and 91\n\nstrategic value, and thus complicates the reconstruction of the Amazon Craton in Nuna. In this 92\n\npaper, we demonstrate that remotely accessed data, such as magnetic field data, can provide 93\n\nadditional information to constrain the relationship between blocks in Nuna. In particular, we 94\n\nuse magnetic field data and its products to evaluate field regimes and magnetic lineaments95\n\nwithin and between cratons. Magnetic field regimes are defined by the concentration of 96\n\nmagnetic anomalies within a designated region. The regimes can be interpreted as calm, 97\n\nintermediate or agitated depending on the frequency pattern of the magnetic anomalies (Fig. 98\n\n2). Magnetic lineaments are normally expressions of contacts, faults, boundaries between 99\n\nterranes, and folds, where secondary magnetite is created through the insertion of oxygen in a 100\n\nFe-bearing environment (Grant, 1985b; Rotherham, 1997).  101\n\n102\n\n103\n\nFig. 2 \u2013 Magnetic field regimes using the Amplitude of the Analytic Signal: (a) calm, (b) 104\n\nintermediate, and (c) agitated.105\n\n\n\n87\n\n2. Geology of the Cratons106\n\n107\n\nThe evaluation of the role of Amazonia in Nuna, or indeed whether it was even part of Nuna, 108\n\nrequires an outline of available geological constrains. Our focus is the Amazon Craton and 109\n\nmost published models suggest that it is linked with one or more of West African, Baltic and/or 110\n\nthe North China cratons. Outlined below are the key geological features of these blocks.111\n\n112\n\n2.1. Amazon Craton113\n\n114\n\nTassinari and Macambira (1999) and Teixeira et al. (2010) divide the Amazon craton into six 115\n\nstructural and geochronological provinces: Central Amazon (> 2.6 Ga), Maroni-Itacai\u00fanas116\n\n(2.25 to 2.10 Ga), Ventuari-Tapaj\u00f3s (1.98 to 1.81 Ga), Rio Negro-Juruena (1.79 to 1.52 Ga),117\n\nRondonian-San Ign\u00e1cio (1.55 to 1.30 Ga) and Suns\u00e1s (1.28 to 0.97 Ga) (Fig. 3). The stable 118\n\nArchean nuclei of the Central Amazon is a granite-greenstone terrain. It was not affected by 119\n\nthe 2.2 Ga to 1.9 Ga Trans-Amazonian Orogeny (Hurley et al., 1967), however120\n\nPaleoproterozoic magmatic and sedimentary events are recorded across this cratonic core.121\n\n122\n\n123\n\nFig. 3 \u2013 Geochronological provinces of the Amazon Craton (Bahlburg et al., 2009). 124\n\n\n\n88\n\nThe Paleoproterozoic Maroni-Itacai\u00fanas Province is located to the northeast of the Central 125\n\nAmazon and can be traced for 1500 km (Fig. 3). It is characterized by greenstone belts and 126\n\nassociated calc-alkaline granitoids, with large metavolcanic-sendimentary sequences 127\n\nmetamorphosed from greenschist to amphibolite facies (Tassinari and Macambira, 1999). To128\n\nthe southwest of the Central Amazon, lies the northwest-southeast elongated Ventuari-Tapaj\u00f3s 129\n\nprovince, composed of calc-alkaline granitoids with juvenile isotopic signatures (Cordani et 130\n\nal., 2010). Further to the southwest, the Rio Negro-Juruena province of granite gneisses and 131\n\ngranitoids of granodioritic and tonalitic compositions forms a 2000 km long and 600 km wide132\n\nbelt aligned northwest-southeast (Fig. 3).133\n\nThe Rondonian-San Ign\u00e1cio and Suns\u00e1s are the largest provinces of the Amazon Craton (Fig. 134\n\n3). The 1.55 to 1.30 Ga Rondonian-San Ign\u00e1cio has granite-gneiss-migmatitic terranes 135\n\nmetamorphosed to amphibolite or granulite facies composing its basement (Tassinari and 136\n\nMacambira, 1999). Cordani and Teixeira (2007) associate the formation of the Rondonian-San 137\n\nIgn\u00e1cio province to the amalgamation of intra-oceanic magmatic arcs and accretionary prisms138\n\nand ultimately their collision to the southwest with the Rio Negro-Juruena province. The 139\n\nSuns\u00e1s orogenic belt is the youngest province of the Amazon Craton. It is the expression of the 140\n\ncollision between Amazonia and Laurentia, during the assembly of the Rodinia (Cawood and 141\n\nPisarevsky, 2017; Sadowski and Bettencourt, 1996; Tohver et al., 2006). The Suns\u00e1s province 142\n\nis characterized by metamorphosed volcano-plutonic-sedimentary sequences intruded by 143\n\nNeoproterozoic granitic suites (Boger et al., 2005).  144\n\n145\n\n2.2. West African Craton 146\n\n147\n\nThe West African Craton, northwest Africa (Fig. 4), has been stable since 2 Ga (Youbi et al., 148\n\n2013). It consists of the Archean Reguibat and Man shields to the north and south, respectively,149\n\nlarge Paleoproterozoic domains separated by cratonic sedimentary basins, and at the northern 150\n\nend, the Anti Atlas belt. The Man shield is composed by TTG-type banded gneiss, older than 151\n\n3.0 Ga (Beckinsale et al., 1980), overlain by greenstone belt lithologies intruded by granites. 152\n\nThe Reguibat Shield contain Archean and Paleoproterozoic migmatites interlayered with mafic 153\n\ngneisses, greenstone belts, and voluminous tonalitic or granodioritic plutons (Key et al., 2008).154\n\nBetween the shields, in the central portion of the West African Craton, the late Proterozoic to 155\n\n\n\n89\n\nPaleozoic Taoudeni basin, and to the north of the Reguibat Shield, the Paleozoic Tindouf basin,156\n\noverlie basement (Guerrak, 1989; Windley, 1987). 157\n\n158\n\n159\n\nFig. 4 \u2013 West African Craton (WAC) (Ennih and Li\u00e9geois, 2008). 160\n\n161\n\nThe Anti-Atlas belt is located between the Alpine Atlas chain and the Tindouf basin. It is 162\n\ncomposed of Proterozoic low- to medium-grade schists and intrusive granitoids, and a thick 163\n\n(ca. 10 km) late Neoproterozoic to Paleozoic sedimentary cover (Soulaimani and Burkhard, 164\n\n2008). Many orogenic cycles are recognized in the West African Craton, spanning from 3.5 to 165\n\n1.75 Ga, along with the 750 to 550 Ma Pan African orogenic event (Ennih and Li\u00e9geois, 2008).166\n\nS\u00f6derlund et al.

Baltic Craton 170\n\n171\n\nBaltica is divisible into the Archean proto-continents of Sarmatia, Volgo-Uralia and 172\n\nFennoscandia (Fig. 5) that were assembled into Baltica along Paleoproterozoic to 173\n\nMesoproterozoic orogenic belts (Bogdanova et al., 2008).  174\n\n\n\n90\n\nThe Fennoscandian Shield, northwest Baltica, is surrounded by Paleoproterozoic crust formed 175\n\nbetween 1.95 and 1.90 Ga, and intruded by the 1850-1650 Ma Transcandinavian Igneous Belt 176\n\n(Bingen et al., 2008). Basement within the shield is cut by Anorthosite-Mangerite-Charnockite-177\n\nGranite (AMCG) (Emslie et al., 1994) and A-type granitoid suites, dolerite dykes and sills,178\n\ntholeiitic basalt, mafic metavolcanic rocks, and gabbro-tonalite complexes were emplaced 179\n\nbetween 1.73 to 1.44 Ga (Bogdanova et al., 2006; Bogdanova et al., 2008). The Central Russian 180\n\ncollisional belt connects Fennoscandia and Sarmatia (Fig. 5). It contains blocks of Archean 181\n\nrocks reworked during the Paleoproterozoic.  182\n\n183\n\n184\n\nFig. 5 \u2013 Baltic Craton (Bogdanova et al., 2008). 185\n\n186\n\nThe Volgo-Uralia Shield in eastern Baltica, contains granitic gneiss as old as 3.3 Ga 187\n\n(Bogdanova et al., 2005) and is characterized by 3.0 to 2.7 Ga belts of metasedimentary and 188\n\nmetaigneous granulites, and subordinate komatiite-bearing greenstone sequences (Bogdanova 189\n\net al., 2008). The collisional belt between the Volgo-Uralia and Sarmatia contains turbiditic 190\n\npelites and greywackes with carbonaceous rocks (Shchipansky et al., 2007). To the north and 191\n\neast of the Volgo-Uralia, lies an infered 1.4 to 0.7 Ga passive margin succession (Bogdanova 192\n\net al., 2008). 193\n\nSarmatia is the result of the amalgamation of 3.7 to 2.6 Ga blocks intercalated by 2.2 to 2.1 Ga 194\n\nPaleoproterozoic belts (Bogdanova et al., 2008). Bogdanova et al. (2006) report north-south 195\n\n\n\n91\n\ntrends, both in the Paleoproterozoic belts and reworked Archean crust, but with an abrupt 196\n\nchange to a northeast-southwest orientation at the northeastern limit of the block. This change 197\n\nmarks the continental-margin igneous belt formed at 2.0 to 1.95 Ga with the collision of 198\n\nSarmatia with the Volgo-Uralia.199\n\n200\n\n2.4. North China Craton201\n\n202\n\nThe North China Craton consists of four Archean blocks (Yinshan, Ordos, Longgang and 203\n\nNangrim), amalgamated by younger orogenic belts (Fig. 6) (Zhao and Cawood, 2012). The 204\n\nYinshan and the Ordos blocks are separated by the 1.95 to 1.92 Ga Khondalite Belt, which 205\n\ntogether form the Western Block of the North China Craton (Dong et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2013; 206\n\nZhao and Cawood, 2012). The Longgang and the Nangrim blocks, united by the Jiao-Liao-Ji 207\n\nbelt at 1.90 Ga, constitute the Eastern Block of the North China Craton (Wu et al., 2013; Zhao 208\n\nand Cawood, 2012). The Western and Eastern blocks collided at ca. 1.85 Ga, forming the 209\n\nPaleoproterozoic Trans-North China Orogen (Zhao et al., 2012). 210\n\n211\n\n212\n\nFig. 6 \u2013 North China Craton (Zhao et al., 2004). 213\n\n214\n\nThe Yinshan Block is composed of Neoarchean tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG)215\n\ngneisses and minor supracrustal rocks metamorphosed at ca. 2.5 Ga (Wu et al., 2013). The 1.95 216\n\nto 1.92 Ga Khondalite Belt, separating the Yinshan and the Ordos blocks is dominated by 217\n\ngneisses, paragneisses, calc-silicate rocks and marbles (Zhao and Zhai, 2013). The Ordos 218\n\nBlock, to the south of the Khondalite Belt, is largely covered by the Mesozoic to Cenozoic 219\n\nOrdos basin. 220\n\n\n\n92\n\nIn the Eastern Block, the Longgang and the Nangrim blocks consist of 3.8 to 3.0 Ga TTG 221\n\ngneisses, 2.7-2.5 Ga syntectonic granitoids, supracrustal ultramafic (komatiitic) to felsic 222\n\nvolcanic rocks and metasedimentary rocks (Zhao et al., 2001). The Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt, separating 223\n\nthe Longgang and Nangrim blocks, is characterized by metamorphosed sedimentary-volcanic 224\n\nsuccessions and associated granitic and mafic intrusions (Zhao and Zhai, 2013). 225\n\nThe Trans-North China Orogen extends north-south for approximately 1200 km and is up to 226\n\n300 km wide (Zhao et al., 2012). It contains late Neoarchean to early Paleoproterozoic (2560227\n\nto 2475 Ma) TTG gneisses, granitoids and greenstone belts developed under continental228\n\nmagmatic arc, island arc- or back-arc basin environments (Wilde et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2012; 229\n\nZhao and Zhai, 2013). 230\n\n231\n\n3. Methodology 232\n\n233\n\n3.1. Data234\n\n235\n\nThe magnetic field data used here was obtained through the Earth Magnetic Anomaly Grid 236\n\n(EMAG2) (Maus et al., 2009). This compiled and corrected data set incorporates satellite, ship 237\n\nand airborne surveys, of which the last two had been given preference where available. The 238\n\nresolution of the grid is 2 arc min (ca. 3.7 km in the equator), and the altitude normalized to 4 239\n\nkm above the geoid. Wavelengths longer than 330 km were obtained with the latest CHAMP 240\n\nsatellite magnetic field model MF6 (http://geomag.org/models/MF6.html, accessed 241\n\n28/02/2017). 242\n\n243\n\n3.2. Magnetic Field Techniques244\n\n245\n\nWe analysed the crustal magnetic field data obtained by EMAG2 to evaluate Nuna 246\n\nreconstructions. Three features of the magnetic field were considered to facilitate comparison 247\n\nof continental-scale structures: the magnetic regime (agitated, intermediate, or calm, e.g. Fig. 248\n\n2), the size of the anomalies, and the orientation of the magnetic lineaments. The resolution 249\n\n\n\n93\n\nand normalized altitude obtained from the EMAG2 are compatible with the scale of the 250\n\ninvestigated tectonic features (> 3.7 km). 251\n\nGeological and tectonic features usually present different amounts of magnetic minerals, 252\n\nresulting in the generation of a magnetic signal, whether inserted in an external (geomagnetic) 253\n\nfield or not. Magnetite is a minor accessory mineral present in most rocks, rarely constituting254\n\nmore than 1 % by volume of a rock (Grant, 1985a). The formation of magnetite, primary or 255\n\nsecondary, is mainly associated with the supply of oxygen in the system. The most important256\n\nfactors that determine the bulk magnetic properties of a rock are the total iron content, the 257\n\noxidation state, the initial crystallization environment, the degree of metamorphism, the degree 258\n\nof silica saturation, the grain size of original sediment (in metasedimentary rocks), and the 259\n\nmajor element chemistry (Grant, 1985a). 260\n\nThe magnetic regimes were evaluated based on the frequency that magnetic anomalies appear 261\n\nin each domain of the cratons. An agitated regime (Fig. 2) is interpreted to represent greater262\n\ntectonic activity through the entire history of the block, but not necessarily in a single period, 263\n\nwhile intermediate and calm regimes indicate less active settings, e.g., passive margins 264\n\nundergoing thermally driven subsidence (Olesen et al., 2007). To observe the magnetic 265\n\nregimes, the Total Magnetic Field (TMI) and the Amplitude of the Analytic Signal 3D (AAS) 266\n\n(Roest et al., 1992) were analysed. The TMI shows overall patterns of anomalies, but depends 267\n\non the geomagnetic (inducing) field at the time of the survey. This dependence is relevant in 268\n\nstudies of large areas, in which the magnetic field changes in orientation and intensity, i.e. the 269\n\npresent magnetic field in the Amazon Craton varies in inclination from -30\u00b0 to +30\u00b0, 270\n\ndeclination from -20\u00b0 to -10\u00b0, and intensity from 33012 to 22890 nT, depending on the location,271\n\nwhereas in Baltica, it changes from +68\u00b0 to +78\u00b0 in inclination, from -2\u00b0 to +10\u00b0 in declination, 272\n\nand from 52952 to 54635 nT in intensity (https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag-web/#igrfwmm,273\n\naccessed in 28/02/2017, the magnetic field refers to the International Geomagnetic Reference 274\n\nField model for same date the data was accessed in the website).275\n\nThe AAS is given by the expression (Roest et al., 1992): 276\n\nAAS = ( T/ x)2 + ( T/ y)2 +( T/ z)2] (1) 277\n\nwhere T refers to the TMI, and x, y, and z directions in Cartesian space. The AAS is one of the 278\n\nmost commonly used techniques to evaluate the lateral limits of sources of potential field 279\n\nanomalies.280\n\n\n\n94\n\nLinked to the magnetic regime, the size of the anomalies was explored with the AAS (Figs. 7b, 281\n\n8b, 9b and 10b). This technique, based on directional derivatives of the field, reveals the lateral 282\n\nlimits of discrete bodies and geological features. It displays little dependence on the direction 283\n\nof the magnetic field, so the location of the anomaly or the presence of remanent magnetization 284\n\ndoes not interfere with the results. Coeval domains connected at some point in Earth evolution 285\n\ntend to present structures of similar sizes (Olesen et al., 2007) if no posterior event altered 286\n\nsignificantly its composition and size. Regional tectonothermal events involving magmatism, 287\n\ndeformation and metamorphism can generate strain and thermal energy sufficient to alter the 288\n\nsize of the anomalies, whether by distorting the body, by changing and or extinguishing the 289\n\nremanent magnetization, or by opening the system to oxygenated fluids and formation of290\n\nsecondary magnetite. These changes can be observed in large areas that not necessarily are 291\n\nlimited to one specific domain.  292\n\nThe assembly of terranes and regional movements inside the cratons are considered by 293\n\nevaluating the size of the anomalies. These events can alter the direction of magnetic 294\n\nlineaments, especially close to the boundary zone, and less significantly in distal regions from 295\n\nthe event. The magnetic lineaments were assessed primarily with the Tilt technique (Verduzco 296\n\net al., 2004), and complemented by AAS. The Tilt technique is given by the relation:297\n\nTILT = tan-1{[ ( T/ z)2]/ ( T/ x)2 + ( T/ y)2]} (2) 298\n\nwhere T refers to the TMI, and x, y, and z directions in Cartesian space. 299\n\nIn successful supercontinent reconstructions, coeval stable domains in adjacent cratons, created 300\n\nunder similar circumstances, should display parallel to subparallel lineaments, and continuity 301\n\nfrom one craton to another. Magnetic overprinting can occur after the stabilization of the 302\n\ndomain, commonly in cratonization events; for example, a regional thermal overprint occurred 303\n\nin the southwest Amazon Craton at ca. 1.3 Ga (Bettencourt et al., 2010). This kind of event is 304\n\naccompanied by tectonic reactivation, deformation, and magmatism, which are manifested by 305\n\nextensive shear zones, mylonitic belts, rifts and sedimentary basins, and post-tectonic and 306\n\nanorogenic intrusions (Cordani and Teixeira, 2007). The magnetic overprint can change the 307\n\norientation of the magnetic lineaments to directions that differ from those obtained during the 308\n\nformation of the domain. Such later tectonic events are generally associated with a regional 309\n\nthermal anomaly of sufficient magnitude to unblock the magnetic moments, which vary 310\n\ndepending on the mineral and size of the grains. These are large-scale events and were mostly 311\n\nrecognized in the cratons used in this work, and are incorporated into our interpretation.  312\n\n\n\n95\n\n313\n\n4. Magnetic Signatures314\n\n315\n\nTo aid the visualization and interpretation of tectonic provinces and lineaments, the colours of 316\n\nthe provinces were normalized to the colours used in the Amazon Craton map according with 317\n\ntheir respective ages (Fig. 3).

Amazon Craton 324\n\n325\n\nThe Amazon Craton has a northwest-southeast trend of lithotectonic assemblages (e.g. Fig. 3)326\n\nthat is mimicked by the magnetic field (Fig. 7). The limits of the various provinces recognized 327\n\nwithin the craton are not clear from the magnetic data set alone, but with the support of 328\n\ngeological data, it was possible to associate specific magnetic signatures for each province. The 329\n\nCentral Amazon province shows an agitated magnetic domain in the north, with large 330\n\nanomalies up to 100 km wide, and decreasing agitation and anomaly size to the south. The 331\n\nMaroni-Itacai\u00fanas province has an agitated magnetic domain, with anomalies up to 130 km332\n\nwide. The Ventuari-Tapaj\u00f3s, Rio Negro-Juruena, Rondonian-San Ign\u00e1cio, and Suns\u00e1s 333\n\nprovinces show a progressive decrease in agitation and anomaly size. Further to the southwest, 334\n\nin the Amazon basin, the magnetic signature shows a significant decrease of agitation in all 335\n\nprovinces. The areas proximal to the borders of the Amazon basin show a new increase of 336\n\nagitation, but still maintaining the overall trend of a reduction in the size of the anomaly.337\n\n338\n\n\n\n97\n\n339\n\nFig. 7 \u2013 Amazon Craton: (a) TMI, (b) AAS, (c) Tilt, and (d) Tilt map overlain by the 340\n\ngeological provinces and magnetic lineaments. The colours of the provinces were normalized 341\n\nto the colours used in the Amazon Craton map (Fig. 4) according with their respective ages. 342\n\n\n\n98\n\nThe magnetic lineaments from the Amazon Craton show the overall northwest-southeast trend 343\n\ndisplayed by the lithotectonic provinces (Fig. 7d). This trend is orthogonal to the northeast-344\n\nsouthwest-oriented accretion that occurred around the Central Amazon province since the 345\n\nPaleoproterozoic. The area occupied by the Amazon Basin, central in the map and covered by 346\n\nPhanerozoic cover, shows a significant decrease in the magnetic regime and in the volume of 347\n\nlineaments. A major lineament crosscuts the craton from east to west, starting in the eastern 348\n\nend of the Amazon basin and continuing through the Suns\u00e1s Belt to the western border.  349\n\n350\n\n4.2. West African Craton 351\n\n352\n\nThe Archean shield regions of the West African Craton, are equivalent in age to the Central 353\n\nAmazon province, and display an overall agitated regime (Fig. 8). The shields, however, 354\n\ndisplay large areas that lack data. The Paleoproterozoic domains display a calm regime in the 355\n\nsouth, but agitated in the northern region proximal to the Anti-Atlas belt. In the areas dominated 356\n\nby Neoproterozoic and Cambrian sedimentary cover, the magnetic field has intermediate 357\n\nagitation in the southeast of the West African Craton, but an agitated character in the northeast,358\n\nproximal to the southern front of Variscan deformation. Like the Archean shields, the359\n\nNeoproterozoic and Cambrian cover incorporate large areas that lack data.  360\n\n361\n\n\n\n99\n\n362\n\nFig. 8 \u2013 West African Craton: (a) TMI, (b) AAS, (c) Tilt, and (d) Tilt map overlain by the 363\n\ngeological provinces and magnetic lineaments. The colours of the provinces were normalized 364\n\nto the colours used in the Amazon Craton map (Fig. 4) according with their respective ages.365\n\n\n\n100\n\nThe relatively small area representing the Pan-African belts within the West African Craton is 366\n\ndominated by a small number of large anomalies up to 100 km wide. The Paleozoic to Recent 367\n\nsedimentary cover, extending over most of the craton, shows intermediate agitation in the 368\n\nmagnetic regime. This cover displays a local increase in agitation when proximal to the 369\n\nSouthern Front of the Variscan deformation, in the northeast of the craton. Large areas without 370\n\ndata compose the sedimentary cover.371\n\nThe north portion of West African Craton has a northwest-southeast trend, parallel to the Anti-372\n\nAtlas belt and the south Variscan front (Fig. 8d). Orthogonal, northeast-southwest-oriented, 373\n\nlineaments can be seen in the Man Shield in the south of the craton and in the area covered by 374\n\nMesozoic to recent sediments in the centre of the craton. Significantly large areas in the 375\n\nsouthwest and northwest West African Craton do not have available magnetic field data, 376\n\nimpeding further analysis. 377\n\n378\n\n4.3. Baltic Craton 379\n\n380\n\nThe Baltic Craton shows an overall calm to intermediate magnetic field in its northern and 381\n\nsouthern portions. A highly agitated east-west trend crosscuts the craton, occupying the region 382\n\nsouth of Fennoscandia, the collisional orogens between Fennoscandia and Sarmatia, and383\n\nbetween Sarmatia and Volgo-Uralia (Fig. 9). We will refer to this trend as the Central Baltica 384\n\nMagnetic regime. The Archean crust in Baltica shows an intermediate magnetic regime in the 385\n\ncentral Archean terrane of Fennoscandia and in the Archean domain in southern Sarmatia. In 386\n\nnorthern Fennoscandia and southwestern Sarmatia, the magnetic regime is agitated. In Volgo-387\n\nUralia, the Archean crust presents an agitated regime, especially in its southern area (Central 388\n\nBaltica Magnetic regime). In regions composed of reworked Archean crust, a calm regime 389\n\ndominates the magnetic field, except in areas proximal to the Central Baltica Magnetic regime.390\n\n391\n\n\n\n101\n\n392\n\nFig. 9 \u2013 Baltic Craton: (a) TMI, (b) AAS, (c) Tilt, and (d) Tilt map overlain by the geological 393\n\nprovinces and magnetic lineaments. The colours of the provinces were normalized to the 394\n\ncolours used in the Amazon Craton map (Fig. 4) according with their respective ages.395\n\n\n\n102\n\nThe magnetic field of the Paleoproterozoic crust of Fennoscandia and Volgo-Uralia, shows 396\n\nhigher agitation than Archean crust reworked during the same period (Figs. 5 and 9). The late 397\n\nPaleoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic structures and suites indicate an increasing magnetic 398\n\nsetting from calm in the east to agitated in the west, which experienced the late 399\n\nMesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic Sveconorwegian orogeny. In the Central Russian 400\n\ncollisional belt, the field remains calm. The mostly inferred passive margins along the northern 401\n\nand eastern borders of the Baltic Craton (Fig. 5) show a predominantly calm regime, with very 402\n\nlong wavelength anomalies, typical of this type of tectonic setting 403\n\n2014). The central area of Baltica, corresponding with the eastern limit of the Central Baltica 404\n\nMagnetic regime, is characterized by a sudden increase in the magnetic regime to agitated.405\n\nThe Fennoscandia, Sarmatia and Volgo-Uralia domains, and the intervening collisional 406\n\norogenic belts, are reflected in the distribution and orientation of the magnetic lineaments from 407\n\nthe Baltic craton (Fig. 9d). Fennoscandia shows a WNW-ESE trend in lineaments, except near 408\n\nthe western limit of the craton with the Sveconorwegian orogen, where the trend varies from 409\n\neast-west to northeast-southwest. An almost orthogonal trend to the Fennoscandian shield 410\n\noccurs in the collisional zone of Fennoscandia and Sarmatia and continues in the northeast-411\n\nsouthwest direction through the Central Russia Collisional Belt. The Volgo-Uralia shield 412\n\ndisplays a similar ENE-WSW orientation. Sarmatia shows an overall northwest-southeast 413\n\norientation, slightly oblique to that in Fennoscandia. The inferred 1.4 to 0.7 Ga passive margins 414\n\nof Baltic craton do not show a predominant trend of magnetic lineaments.415\n\n416\n\n4.4. North China Craton 417\n\n418\n\nThe North China Craton is characterized by long wavelength anomalies, and increasing 419\n\nagitation near the limits between the Archean to Paleoproterozoic basement and the orogens 420\n\nand belts (Fig. 10). A northeast-southwest trend is visible in all magnetic fields and derived 421\n\nmaps. The Archean to Paleoproterozoic basement presents intermediate to agitated regimes 422\n\nwith large magnetic anomalies. The magnetic regimes in the Ordos and Longgang blocks have 423\n\nintermediate frequency, whereas the Yinshan block shows an increased concentration of 424\n\nanomalies.

Results 446\n\n447\n\nBased on mapping the magnetic regimes and lineaments for Amazonia, West Africa, Baltica,448\n\nand North China, Tilt maps were overlain by geological provinces and magnetic lineaments to 449\n\ncompare a variety of proposed Nuna reconstructions (Figs. 12, 14 and 16). This enables a visual 450\n\ncomparison of the alignment and possible continuity of magnetic lineaments within and 451\n\nbetween the cratons. The continuity of provinces based on the magnetic field data was 452\n\ncompared with respect to available geological and paleomagnetic data to evaluate the Nuna 453\n\nreconstructions of Mertanen and Pesonen (2012), Pisarevsky et al. (2014) and Pehrsson et al. 454\n\n(2015).455\n\n456\n\n5.1.Mertanen and Pesonen (2012) 457\n\n458\n\nMertanen and Pesonen (2012) used a compilation of Precambrian paleopoles with minimum 459\n\nQ-values of four (Van der Voo, 1990) to propose Nuna reconstructions for 2.45, 1.88, 1.78, 460\n\n1.63, 1.53, 1.26 and 1.04 Ga. The Q-value is a 7-point measure that determines the quality of 461\n\na paleopole measurement. Their reconstructions show that by 1.53 Ga an assembled Nuna 462\n\nincluded a continuous landmass formed by Amazonia, Baltica, Laurentia and Australia (Fig. 463\n\n11). Siberia and North China cratons are disconnected from this main landmass reflecting a 464\n\nlack of continuity between their Paleoproterozoic and older orogenic belts with coeval units in 465\n\ntheir proposed reconstruction. The position of Amazonia with respect to Baltica is based on the 466\n\ninferred continuity of the 1.9 Ga to 1.8 Ga Ventuari-Tapaj\u00f3s Province with the Svecofennian, 467\n\nand the 1.8 Ga to 1.5 Ga Rio Negro-Juruena provinces with the Trans-Scandinavian Igneous 468\n\nBelt. Laurentia is orientated so the 1.8 Ga to 1.5 Ga orogenic belts along its eastern and 469\n\nsouthwestern margins face an open ocean, thus forming a long lasting accretionary orogen that 470\n\nwas only terminated with the Mesoproterozoic Grenville collisional event (Cawood and 471\n\nPisarevsky, 2017; Hynes and Rivers, 2010; Karlstrom et al., 2000; Zhao et al., 2002).   472\n\n\n\n105\n\n473\n\nFig. 11 \u2013 Nuna reconstruction at 1.53 Ga. 474\n\n475\n\nThe Nuna reconstruction proposed by Mertanen and Pesonen (2012) shows Baltica and the 476\n\nNorth China cratons adjacent to the Amazon Craton (Figs. 11 and 12). The Amazon Craton is 477\n\nrotated approximately 35\u00b0 clockwise, whereas Baltica is rotated 20\u00b0 and North China 78\u00b0 anti-478\n\nclockwise relative to their present orientation. The magnetic lineaments of the Paleo- to 479\n\nMesoproterozoic domains from Amazon and Baltica are sub-parallel, displaying a northwest-480\n\nsoutheast trend. The Archean Central Amazon and the Archean crust of Sarmatia maintain this 481\n\nalignment and suggest a connection of both cratons. Although the apparent geological and 482\n\ngeochronological continuity of the Longgang Block and the Trans-North China Orogen with 483\n\nthe Archean and Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic crust of Fennoscandia support their reconstruction,484\n\nthe magnetic lineaments of North China Craton are near orthogonal to those of Fennoscandia 485\n\n(Fig. 12). 486\n\n487\n\n\n\n106\n\n488\n\nFig. 12 \u2013 Nuna reconstruction at 1.53 Ga of the Amazon and adjacent cratons, Baltica and 489\n\nNorth China, according to Mertanen and Pesonen (2012), added by the magnetic lineaments. 490\n\nThe colours of the geological units in Baltic and North China cratons were normalized to the 491\n\ncolours of provinces of similar age in the Amazon Craton.492\n\n493\n\n\n\n107\n\n5.2. Pisarevsky et al. (2014)494\n\n495\n\nPisarevsky et al. (2014) used apparent polar wander paths (APWPs) and coeval paired 496\n\npaleopoles between continents to evaluate possible cratonic connections during the 497\n\nProterozoic. They propose a model in which two separated landmasses, East and West Nuna, 498\n\nformed a single supercontinent between 1650 and 1580 Ma. Pisarevsky et al. (2014) present 499\n\nthe evolution of the Nuna through a series of global paleogeographic reconstructions for 1770, 500\n\n1720, 1650, 1580, 1500, 1470, 1450, 1380 and 1270 Ma. West Nuna was composed by 501\n\nLaurentia, Baltica and possibly India, whereas the East Nuna contained Australia, Mawson 502\n\n(Antarctica), and North China. After ca. 1500 Ma, Siberia and Congo/S\u00e3o Francisco joined 503\n\nNuna, whereas West African and the Amazon cratons formed a separate continent from Nuna 504\n\n(Fig. 13). 505\n\n506\n\n507\n\nFig. 13 \u2013 Nuna reconstruction at ca. 1470 Ma. 508\n\n509\n\n\n\n108\n\nIn the Pisarevsky et al. (2014) reconstruction the Amazon and the West African cratons are 510\n\nseparate from the Nuna supercontinent. Both cratons lie northwest of the main Nuna landmass511\n\nwith Amazonia rotated 137\u00b0 and the West Africa 74\u00b0 anti-clockwise relative to their present 512\n\norientation. No geological or geochronological continuity between the two cratons is visible in 513\n\nthis reconstruction (Fig. 14). The Paleoproterozoic Maroni-Itacai\u00fanas (1.98 to 1.81 Ga) 514\n\npresents a northeast-southwest trend in the magnetic lineaments subparallel with one of the two 515\n\ntrends shown in the Man Shield. None of the remaining domains from the West African Craton 516\n\ndisplay a similar parallelism with coeval provinces in the Amazon Craton.  517\n\n518\n\n519\n\nFig. 14 \u2013 1450 Ga Nuna reconstruction of the Amazon and the adjacent West Africa, added 520\n\nby the magnetic lineaments. The colours of the geological units in the West African Craton 521\n\nwere normalized to the colours of provinces of similar age in the Amazon Craton. 522\n\n523\n\n524\n\n525\n\n\n\n109\n\n5.3. Pehrsson et al. (2015) 526\n\n527\n\nThe reconstruction proposed by Pehrsson et al. (2015) attempts to integrate data from previous 528\n\nmodels, including paleomagnetic data, with constraints from ore deposit as the formation and 529\n\npreservation of such deposits is linked to the supercontinent cycle (Cawood and Hawkesworth, 530\n\n2015). The deposits types were used to test the reconstructions, based on the expected 531\n\nenvironment and age for each deposit type; i.e. volcanic-hosted massive sulphides in collisional 532\n\nor accretionary settings, sediment-hosted copper deposits in extensional settings, and uranium 533\n\nmineralization in subtropical latitudes.534\n\nPehrsson et al. (2015) show a Nuna reconstruction from 1.6 and 1.4 Ga (Fig. 15), with a main 535\n\nlandmass composed of Laurentia, Baltic, Amazon, Rio de la Plata, West African, Siberia and 536\n\nS\u00e3o Francisco/Congo cratons. Proto-Australia (South, North and West Australia) and the 537\n\nYangtze cratons are located northeast of the main Nuna mass and separated by a zone 538\n\nundergoing regional extension, leading ultimately to ocean formation. North China, North and 539\n\nSouth India, Rayner and the Kalahari cratons are separate from Nuna. 540\n\n541\n\n\n\n110\n\n542\n\nFig. 15 \u2013 Reconstruction of Nuna for the period from 1.6 to 1.45 Ga. 543\n\n544\n\nThe Pehrsson et al. (2015) reconstruction locates the Amazon Craton in the southern 545\n\nhemisphere, to the south-southeast of Baltica and to the southwest of West Africa (Fig. 16).546\n\nThis reconstruction involves anticlockwise rotation of the Amazon Craton by 20\u00b0, Baltica by547\n\n51\u00b0, and West Africa by 48\u00b0. The WNW-ESE-oriented magnetic lineaments of the Ventuari-548\n\nTapaj\u00f3s province are subparallel to the lineaments in the Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic crust of 549\n\nFennoscandia, so are the lineaments in the Maroni-Itacai\u00fanas and the Paleoproterozoic crust of 550\n\nSarmatia (Fig. 5). The West African Craton, connected with the present east of the Amazon 551\n\nCraton, displays a similar parallelism between the lineaments of the coeval Man Shield (West 552\n\nAfrica), the Maroni-Itacai\u00fanas province (Amazon) and the Sarmatia Paleoproterozoic crust 553\n\n(Baltica). Lineaments from the south of the Central Amazon province also show a subparallel 554\n\n\n\n111\n\ntrend to the lineaments of the Archean domain in the southern part of West Africa. In this last 555\n\ncase, however, the parallelism is speculative, given the small number and size of the lineaments 556\n\nin the West Africa due to absence of magnetic field data.557\n\n558\n\n559\n\nFig. 16 \u2013 Southern area of Nuna reconstruction for the period of 1.60 to 1.40 Ga, added by 560\n\nthe magnetic lineaments. This area presents the Amazon Craton adjacent to Baltica and West 561\n\nAfrica. The colours of the geological units in Baltic and West African cratons were 562\n\nnormalized to the colours of provinces of similar age in the Amazon Craton. 563\n\n564\n\n565\n\n\n\n112\n\n6. Discussion566\n\n567\n\nMagnetic anomaly patterns of sources in blocks of different cratons should be different of each 568\n\nother, unless they were together during their formation and/or overprinted during reworking by 569\n\nyounger events. The comparison of anomalies for the Amazon, West African, Baltic and North 570\n\nChina cratons shows that coeval and possibly related Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic domains in 571\n\nthe different cratons have different sizes of anomalies. Thus, the wavelength of anomalies for 572\n\nAmazon and West Africa are predominantly larger than those in Baltica (Figs. 7 to 9; compare 573\n\nthe Maroni-Itacai\u00fanas, Man Shield and the Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic crust of Fennoscandia).574\n\nReasons for these differences could include distortion caused by different projections of large 575\n\nlandmasses, and the different resolution and amount of data of the compiled magnetic surveys.   576\n\nIn the Mertanen and Pesonen (2012) reconstruction, the approximately coeval Paleo- to 577\n\nMesoproterozoic provinces in Amazon, Baltic and North China cratons show north-south 578\n\ncontinuity between the first two cratons, and northwest-southeast with the last two. The 579\n\nLonggang Block of the North China Craton is well aligned with the Archean crust of 580\n\nFennoscandia, and the Mesoproterozoic terranes (1.79 to 1.52 Ga) of Amazon and 581\n\nFennoscandia also maintain continuity. The continuity does not, however, extend to the582\n\nArchean Western Block of North China Craton, which has no counterpart in either Amazon or 583\n\nBaltica. These latter two cratons were still accreting younger provinces until 1.53 Ga, whereas 584\n\nthe North China was already stabilized by this time. The lineaments in the 1.98 to 1.81 Ga585\n\ndomains in Amazon and Baltica are well aligned but not with the North China Craton, which 586\n\nare almost orthogonal orientation to those in the other two cratons. The Amazon and Baltica 587\n\ndomains show concordant magnetic regimes, which again cannot be extended to those of the 588\n\nNorth China Craton. 589\n\nThe model of Pisarevsky et al. (2014) is the only one in which the Amazon Craton, along with 590\n\nWest Africa, is not included within Nuna in the Mesoproterozoic (Figs. 1 and 14). The relative 591\n\norientation and juxtaposition of Amazonia and West Africa proposed by Pisarevsky et al. 592\n\n(2014) is not supported by the geological and magnetic data which lack continuity between the 593\n\ntwo cratons, except perhaps for a small number of lineaments in the Maroni-Itacai\u00fanas 594\n\nprovince and Man Shield due to 2.15-2.14 Ga calc-alkaline magmatism in the former (da Rosa-595\n\nCosta et al., 2006), and the 2.15 Ga Eburnean orogeny in the latter (Abouchami et al., 1990).596\n\nThe Maroni-Itacai\u00fanas province and the Man Shield, however, show divergent magnetic 597\n\n\n\n113\n\nregimes, the Amazonic domain shows an agitated behaviour, whereas the West African Man 598\n\nShield presents a calm regime.599\n\nPehrsson et al. (2015), like Mertanen and Pesonen (2012), locate Baltica to the north of the 600\n\nAmazon Craton but with a further additional rotation of Baltica to further enhance geological 601\n\ncompatibility and continuity of the 1.98 to 1.81 Ga Ventuari-Tapaj\u00f3s province of the Amazon 602\n\nCraton with the coeval terranes of Fennoscandia. This rotation promoted the contact of the 2.25 603\n\nto 2.10 Ga Maroni-Itacai\u00fanas with the reworked 2.20 to 2.00 Paleoproterozoic crust of 604\n\nSarmatia. This contact, in the Tilt map (Fig. 14), reveals possible lineament continuity in the 605\n\nextreme north of the Amazonic domain with the Sarmatian crust to the southwest. As discussed 606\n\nwith respect to the Mertanen and Pesonen (2012) reconstruction, the connection of Baltica with 607\n\nthe Amazon Craton is supported by the magnetic regimes of the coeval domains. The West 608\n\nAfrican Craton, which is significantly rotated from the position proposed by Pisarevsky et al. 609\n\n(2014), allows the alignment of the lineaments from the Central Amazon and the Maroni-610\n\nItacai\u00fanas provinces with the Archean domain and Man Shield, respectively. Evaluating the 611\n\ncontinuity and parallelism of lineaments between the West Africa and Baltica is impaired by 612\n\nthe absence of data in several areas of the West African Craton. 613\n\n614\n\n7. Conclusions 615\n\n616\n\nThe configuration of the Nuna supercontinent is a matter of ongoing debate as indicated by the 617\n\ndiverse distribution of cratonic blocks in the recent reconstructions of Mertanen and Pesonen 618\n\n(2012), Pisarevsky et al. (2014), and Pehrsson et al. (2015). These models, as well as many 619\n\nothers (e.g. D'Agrella-Filho et al., 2012; Evans and Mitchell, 2011; Johansson, 2009; Rogers 620\n\nand Santosh, 2002; Zhao et al., 2004), involve a similar configuration for the supercontinents 621\n\ncratonic core juxtaposing northeast Laurentia and northern Baltica, with Siberia occupying an 622\n\nadjacent or nearby position (e.g. Fig. 1). But the configuration of other continental blocks with 623\n\nrespect to this core assemblage, and even if these other cratonic fragments were part of Nuna 624\n\nor separate continents, is unresolved. Most attempts to reconstruct Nuna are based on a 625\n\ncombination of geologic, geochemical, paleomagnetic, ore deposit data, with variations 626\n\nbetween models often reflecting differences in the emphasis placed on the different data sets. 627\n\nThus, in the models evaluated here in, Mertanen and Pesonen (2012) and Pisarevsky et al. 628\n\n(2014) integrated a combination of geological and paleomagnetic data, while Pehrsson et al. 629\n\n\n\n114\n\n(2015) also used isotopic and ore deposit data. In our evaluation of models of Nuna 630\n\nreconstruction, we incorporated a worldwide compilation of magnetic field data (magnetic field 631\n\nEMAG2). We used this to analyse the magnetic regime of each of the lithotectonic domains632\n\nrecognized in the Amazon, West African, Baltic and North China cratons, as well as the 633\n\nwavelength of the magnetic anomalies, and magnetic lineaments, which we then compare with 634\n\nproposed paleogeographic configurations for these blocks.  635\n\nSimilarities in the geology, age, magnetic regime, and lineaments between Archean to 636\n\nMesoproterozoic domains of the Amazon and Baltic cratons are consistent with the 637\n\nreconstructions of Mertanen and Pesonen (2012) and Pehrsson et al. (2015). The geological 638\n\ndata for the North China Craton shows some similarities to the adjoining Amazonia and Baltic 639\n\ncratons in the configuration proposed by Mertanen and Pesonen (2012), but not in the magnetic 640\n\nfield evidence. The connections between the West African and Amazon cratons proposed by 641\n\nPisarevsky et al. (2014) and Pehrsson et al. (2015) are not entirely supported by the magnetic 642\n\nfield data. However, juxtaposition of the present western or southern border of the West 643\n\nAfrican Craton with the northeast of the Amazon Craton would align the magnetic features of 644\n\nthe two cratons. 645\n\nOf three Nuna evaluated reconstructions, the model of Pehrsson et al. (2015) agrees best with 646\n\nthe magnetic field data. It locates the Amazon Craton towards the southern portion of the Nuna647\n\nsupercontinent, connected to the West African and Baltic cratons, with an open ocean to its 648\n\nwest, where continuous accretion would occur until the mid-Neoproterozoic.  649\n\n650\n\n8.

The questions argued \n\nabout how much a single suite can tell about itself and the environment around it, about honest \n\nmistakes in during geophysical modelling, and the Earth evolution. Three papers were \n\npresented proposing answers for these questions. First, a study considering the effects that \n\nusing inaccurate constraints have in the outcome of potential field data modelling. Then, the \n\ndevelopment of a geophysical model from this suite, and a geochemical analysis of the tectonic \n\nframework and parental magma that resulted in the intrusion of the Figueira Branca Suite. The \n\nthird and last part of the thesis consisted on using magnetic field data to evaluate supercontinent \n\nreconstruction models.  \n\nThe Figueira Branca Suite is a 1425 Ma layered mafic-ultramafic complex intruded in \n\nthe Alto Jauru group, southwest Amazon Craton. This suite has been focus of isotopic and \n\npaleomagnetic studies, and was the centre of the three studies that composed this thesis. The \n\nsuite is composed by four northwest-southeast-oriented bodies: Indiava\u00ed, Azteca, Figueira \n\nBranca and Jauru, from southeast to northwest. The environment that surrounds the Figueira \n\nBranca Suite consists in the 1.8 Ga Alto Jauru meta-volcanosedimentary group that hosts the \n\nsuite, the granite-gneiss Santa Helena (to the west) and \u00c1gua Clara (to the east) suites.\n\nModelling, in Earth Sciences, is the ultimate effort to represent a part of the Earth that \n\ncannot be entirely seen. Geophysics and geochemistry are two of the sciences that most \n\nfrequently use modelling. This thesis repeatedly used this resource, from testing how a \n\nmicroscopic analysis affects the constraints used in the modelling, to the evaluation of \n\nsupercontinent reconstruction models with magnetic field data. \n\n\n\n1\n\nPreliminary data showed abnormally low values of density and magnetic susceptibility \n\nin hand samples of the Figueira Branca Suite. A preliminary model was developed using these \n\nvalues as constraints. The shape, depth and remanent magnetization from this model, however, \n\ndid not agree with geological observations and paleomagnetic data. Hand samples did not \n\ndisplay clear signs of weathering or evidences that could explain the low properties, so thin \n\nsections were extracted to investigate their possible cause. The thin sections displayed intense \n\nweathering and serpentinization in some samples. This process justified a deeper investigation \n\non how and how much an inaccurate constraint affect the outcome from modelling. In this case, \n\nthe density and the magnetic susceptibility were evaluated for gravity (Bouguer anomaly) and \n\nmagnetic field respectively.\n\nThe investigation of the effects of inaccurate constraints was made using a synthetic \n\nmodel and real data from the Indiava\u00ed body, the southernmost intrusion of the Figueira Branca \n\nSuite. The investigated cases proved that using inaccurate constraints can produce errors about \n\n50% higher than the correct and shapes significantly different than the reality. The results also \n\nshowed that in cases that a more thorough analysis in the sources of the constraints, the best \n\nsolution is to perform the modelling setting the constraints free, instead of fixing inaccurate \n\nvalues and forcing the reduction of the error through the variation of depth and shape of the \n\nmodels.\n\nWith a reliable modelling methodology and constraints, it was possible to model the \n\nremaining anomalies of the suite. Previous studies of the Figueira Branca Suite suggest that it \n\nextended further to the north and northeast of the four cited bodies. However, no other analogue \n\ngeophysical signature in the Jauru Terrane represented an intrusion of the same geological \n\ncharacteristics of the Figueira Branca Suite bodies.\n\n\n\n1\n\nThe geophysical models obtained for the suite intrusive bodies displayed very shallow \n\nsill-like shapes extending 8 km on average in the northwest direction. Mineralogy and \n\ngeochemical data indicated gabbroic rocks with predominance of plagioclase, olivine, and \n\nvariable amounts of intergrown pyroxene. The increasing presence of pyroxene indicated a \n\nfractionation in the parental magma, whereas the change in the slope of the REE normalized to \n\nchondrites suggested an increase in the amount of melt. Both datasets together permitted to \n\npropose the sequence of magma extraction that generated the bodies of the Figueira Branca \n\nSuite was: Indiava\u00ed, Figueira Branca, Azteca and Jauru. Trace elements completed the data, \n\ndisplaying evidences of hydrous melts in the parental magma, typical from supra-subduction \n\nenvironments. This geochemical signature for the parental magma, associated with the tectonic \n\nframework where the suite is hosted, was interpreted as a magmatism in the back-arc zone of \n\nthe Santa Helena Orogen.\n\nThe answers for how much a suite can tell about itself and the environment that hosts \n\nit, and the larger scale analysis of the Jauru Terrane raised the last question: what about the \n\nEarth evolution? Where was the Amazon Craton by the time of the Santa Helena orogeny, and \n\nwhen was the Figueira Branca Suite intrusive event? The supercontinent Nuna position and the \n\ncratonic fragments that composed it are a matter of ongoing debate. By consequence, the debate \n\nextends to the Amazon Craton. Supercontinent reconstructions varies depending the amount \n\nand kind of data used to constraint them (e.g. combination of geologic, geochemical, \n\npaleomagnetic, and ore deposit data). Three recent reconstructions Mertanen and Pesonen \n\n(2012), Pisarevsky et al. (2014), and Pehrsson et al. (2015) suggest different configurations for \n\nthe Nuna supercontinent, where Amazonia is adjacent to the West African, Baltic and/or the \n\nNorth China cratons. Using a worldwide compilation of magnetic field data (EMAG2), these \n\nreconstructions were analysed based on the magnetic regimes and lineaments of each block, \n\nand then the proposed paleogeographic configurations for these blocks.  \n\n\n\n12\n\nNone of the reconstructions were entirely supported by the magnetic field data, however \n\nPehrsson et al. (2015) reconstruction agrees best with it. This reconstruction locates the \n\nAmazon Craton towards the southern portion of the supercontinent, connected in the northeast\n\nto the West Africa, and in the north to Baltica cratons. In this reconstruction, the southwest of \n\nthe Amazon Craton has open ocean to its west, where continuous accretion would occur until \n\nthe mid-Neoproterozoic, forming the Santa Helena Orogen and, later, the back-arc extension \n\nthat permitted the intrusion of the Figueira Branca Suite.\n\n\n\n12\n\n.

The method has evolved over several decades and recent advances continue 38\nto present new outbreaks in instrumentation, data processing and interpretation.  39\nRadioelement concentrations measured by gamma-ray spectroscopy reflect the mineral 40\ncomposition of an outcrop. However, magmatism, erosion, hydrothermal activity and/or tectonic 41\nevents can significantly change the gamma signature. This work explores how different 42\nprocesses affect the emission of radioelements and how information can be extracted from this. 43\nThe radiometric response of several geological terrains with different tectonic histories were 44\ncompared, whereas radiometric signatures of granitic intrusions, alluvium regions, craters and 45\nshear zones were demonstrated. The results show how the gamma spectrometric method can 46\ncontribute significant information, can complement and go beyond the superficial geology. 47\n\n48\n\n1 Introduction 49\n50\n\nThe gamma spectrometric method considers the natural decay of K, equivalent Th and U 51\n(eTh and eU, respectively) and maps these element\u2019s distribution spatially. The method has a 52\nbroad range of applications, such as: identifying outcropping points of igneous intrusions 53\n[Ribeiro, 2014], characterization of undifferentiated intrusions [Ulbrich et al., 2009], mineral 54\nprospecting [Fornazzari Neto and Ferreira, 2003; Carrino et al., 2007], study of impact craters 55\n[Vasconcelos et al., 2012], environmental studies [Concei\u00e7\u00e3o and Bonotto, 2003], oil exploration 56\n[Saunders et al., 1987; L\u00fcning and Kolonic, 2003], study of hydrothermal alteration zones 57\n[Biondi et al., 2001] and study of radioactive accidents impact [IAEA, 2003]. 58\n\nAlthough the limited penetration in the first dozens of centimeters, gamma-rays are the 59\nmost penetrating form of radiation available. The shallow reach makes the gamma-spectrometry 60\na reliable source of data for near-surface geophysical studies. Large scale structural analyses 61\n[N\u00f3brega et al. 2011; Ribeiro et al. 2013], mineral, oil and gas exploration [Saunders et al. 1987; 62\n1993, 1994], astrophysical phenomena [Maziviero et al. 2013; Bose et al. 2013] and 63\nenvironmental monitoring [Sanderson et al. 2004; Rachkovskij and Revunova 2011] are only a 64\nfew of the fields which the gamma-ray spectrometry has been successfully applied over the last 65\neighty years.66\n\nSeveral minerals of economic interest (such as Au, Zn, Ag, Cu) do not present a strong 67\ngeophysical signature, but are associated with specific geological processes (such as 68\nhydrothermal activity) and thus techniques which can indicate the geological process can provide 69\nan important vector for exploration. For example, Ostrovsky [1975] highlights the antagonism in 70\nK and eTh behaviors under this activity, and this characteristic was then used by several authors 71\nto propose different techniques to enhance the hydrothermal signature in radiometric data, such 72\nas F parameter [Gnojek and Prichystal, 1985]. The correct application of F factor techniques can 73\nprovide an important tool to optimize the exploration of hydrothermal deposits. 74\n\nFiltering parameters (leveling and microleveling - Hogg, 1979; Paterson and Reeves,75\n1985; Urquhart, 1988; Minty, 1991] and gridding techniques (such as minimum curvature and 76\nkriging - Briggs, 1974; Hansen, 1993] have a direct influence on the final map and can introduce 77\npseudo-anomalies not related with geological structures. Although the correct application of 78\nthese procedures is a make or break moment for gamma spectroscopy, it is not easy to find 79\n\n1"}]}}}
