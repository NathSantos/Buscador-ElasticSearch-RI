Em \u00faltimo caso, a \n\ninfe\u00e7\u00e3o causada pelo HPV pode levar ao aparecimento de massas tumorais. De facto, o \u00e1cido \n\ndesoxirribonucleico (DNA) do HPV foi encontrado em 99,7% dos casos de cancro do colo do \n\n\u00fatero, provocando mais de meio milh\u00e3o de mortes. A progress\u00e3o do cancro \u00e9 devida \u00e0 \n\nexpress\u00e3o das oncoprote\u00ednas E6 e E7, consideradas tumorog\u00e9nicas pela sua capacidade de \n\nalterar o ciclo celular, sendo estas respons\u00e1veis pela replica\u00e7\u00e3o viral e transforma\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nimortaliza\u00e7\u00e3o das c\u00e9lulas hospedeiras. Atualmente, existem apenas duas vacinas \n\ncomercializadas contra a infe\u00e7\u00e3o pelo HPV: a Gardasil\u00ae e a Cervarix\u00ae. Estas vacinas \n\nprofil\u00e1ticas ativam unicamente a imunidade humoral, pela gera\u00e7\u00e3o de anticorpos contra o \n\nHPV e s\u00e3o somente preventivas, ou seja, apenas s\u00e3o efetivas antes de ocorrer a infe\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nAssim, as vacinas terap\u00eauticas t\u00eam a promissora vantagem de conseguir eliminar les\u00f5es pr\u00e9-\n\nexistentes e at\u00e9 tumores. \n\nSurgem ent\u00e3o algumas estrat\u00e9gias terap\u00eauticas inovadoras, como a terapia g\u00e9nica e as \n\nvacinas de DNA, que ativam tanto a resposta humoral como a celular, permitindo a preven\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ne o tratamento de doen\u00e7as como o cancro do colo do \u00fatero. Nas vacinas de DNA, o uso do DNA \n\nplasm\u00eddico (pDNA) como vetor n\u00e3o viral torna-se bastante apelativo, n\u00e3o s\u00f3 pela sua baixa \n\ntoxicidade e elevada seguran\u00e7a, mas tamb\u00e9m pela simples produ\u00e7\u00e3o e aplica\u00e7\u00e3o. A produ\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndestas vacinas requer a purifica\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 escala preparativa do pDNA superenrolado (sc), \n\nconsiderada a isoforma biologicamente ativa. \u00c9, por isso, necess\u00e1rio explorar diversas \n\nestrat\u00e9gias de purifica\u00e7\u00e3o de forma a obter o maior rendimento e pureza do pDNA sc. \n\nA cromatografia de afinidade com amino\u00e1cidos tem demonstrado ser uma abordagem \n\npromissora, pois permite a intera\u00e7\u00e3o seletiva entre ligandos espec\u00edficos e as biomol\u00e9culas de \n\ninteresse, \u00e0 semelhan\u00e7a de intera\u00e7\u00f5es biol\u00f3gicas que ocorrem naturalmente entre prote\u00ednas a \n\namino\u00e1cidos no organismo. Para al\u00e9m disso, o uso de monolitos como suporte cromatogr\u00e1fico \n\ntem vindo a demonstrar que estes suportes s\u00e3o uma excelente alternativa aos convencionais, \n\nvisto terem uma maior capacidade de liga\u00e7\u00e3o para mol\u00e9culas de grandes dimens\u00f5es e que \n\npossibilitam a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de fluxos mais elevados, diminuindo o tempo de reten\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nbiomol\u00e9cula de interesse, evitando assim a sua degrada\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nAssim, o presente trabalho teve como primeiro objetivo explorar diferentes estrat\u00e9gias de \n\nelui\u00e7\u00e3o cromatogr\u00e1ficas, utilizando um monolito de arginina com um bra\u00e7o espa\u00e7ador, no \n\nsentido de purificar o pDNA sc a usar numa vacina de DNA contra o cancro do colo do \u00fatero. \n\nInicialmente, foram realizados v\u00e1rios ensaios, quer em condi\u00e7\u00f5es de elui\u00e7\u00e3o i\u00f3nicas quer \n\nhidrof\u00f3bicas, para avaliar o comportamento cromatogr\u00e1fico e a influ\u00eancia dos diferentes \n\ngrupos imobilizados no monolito de ep\u00f3xi. Depois, o monolito de arginina com um bra\u00e7o \n\n\n\n vi \n\nespa\u00e7ador foi caracterizado em termos de capacidade din\u00e2mica de liga\u00e7\u00e3o (2.53 mg/mL \n\nobtido a 10% da curva \u201cbreakthrough\u201d), confirmando que este suporte apresenta maior \n\ncapacidade de liga\u00e7\u00e3o do que um suporte convencional (0.133 mg/mL), modificados com o \n\nmesmo ligando (arginina). Por outro lado, este valor \u00e9 menor que o valor de capacidade de \n\nliga\u00e7\u00e3o obtido com o monolito de arginina (3.55 mg/mL), provavelmente devido \u00e0 \n\neletronegatividade do bra\u00e7o espa\u00e7ador que promove repuls\u00e3o pelo pDNA. Para avaliar a \n\nseletividade do suporte, v\u00e1rios ensaios foram realizados utilizando amostras de plasm\u00eddeo \n\npr\u00e9-purificado com o kit comercial (isoformas circular aberta, linear e sc), manipulando a \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o de cloreto de s\u00f3dio (NaCl) e o pH do tamp\u00e3o de elui\u00e7\u00e3o. Os resultados \n\ncomprovaram que \u00e9 poss\u00edvel obter a isoforma sc purificada, apesar da sua recupera\u00e7\u00e3o ser \n\nligeiramente sacrificada. Posteriormente, prosseguiu-se para a purifica\u00e7\u00e3o do pDNA sc a \n\npartir de uma amostra mais complexa de lisado de Escherichia coli (E. coli). Diferentes \n\nestrat\u00e9gias de elui\u00e7\u00e3o foram abordadas, incluindo a manipula\u00e7\u00e3o de NaCl e pH, assim como a \n\nadi\u00e7\u00e3o de arginina no tamp\u00e3o de elui\u00e7\u00e3o como agente de competi\u00e7\u00e3o. Ap\u00f3s v\u00e1rias \n\notimiza\u00e7\u00f5es, a estrat\u00e9gia que melhor resultou na purifica\u00e7\u00e3o da isoforma de interesse foi a de \n\num gradiente por passos com o tamp\u00e3o de equil\u00edbrio a 680 mM de NaCl em tamp\u00e3o 10 mM tris \n\ne 10 mM EDTA (Tris-EDTA), pH 7 e o tamp\u00e3o de elui\u00e7\u00e3o a 649 mM e 1 M de NaCl em Tris-EDTA, \n\npH 7,5. Esta estrat\u00e9gia cromatogr\u00e1fica permitiu obter o plasm\u00eddeo sc com 93,3% de pureza e \n\n72% de recupera\u00e7\u00e3o. A aplicabilidade do monolito de arginina com um bra\u00e7o espa\u00e7ador na \n\npurifica\u00e7\u00e3o do plasm\u00eddeo \u00e0 escala preparativa tamb\u00e9m foi avaliada, tendo-se recuperado o \n\nplasm\u00eddeo com 98,5% de pureza. As impurezas (DNA gen\u00f3mico, prote\u00ednas e endotoxinas) das \n\nfra\u00e7\u00f5es recolhidas de pDNA sc, tanto na escala laboratorial como na preparativa, foram \n\nquantificadas, estando os resultados dentro dos valores recomendados pelas ag\u00eancias \n\nreguladoras. Assim sendo, o monolito de arginina com um bra\u00e7o espa\u00e7ador permitiu uma \n\nr\u00e1pida e eficaz separa\u00e7\u00e3o do pDNA sc, recorrendo a baixas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de sal, tanto numa \n\nescala laboratorial como preparativa. \n\nPor outro lado, sabe-se que apenas um em mil plasm\u00eddeos apresentados \u00e0s c\u00e9lulas \n\neucari\u00f3ticas conseguem alcan\u00e7ar o n\u00facleo e levar \u00e0 express\u00e3o do gene de interesse. Desta \n\nforma, torna-se crucial desenvolver estrat\u00e9gias que permitam a prote\u00e7\u00e3o do pDNA e que \n\nfacilitem a sua entrada no n\u00facleo. O uso de nanopart\u00edculas tem revelado ser uma valiosa \n\nsolu\u00e7\u00e3o, pois al\u00e9m de protegerem o pDNA da degrada\u00e7\u00e3o enzim\u00e1tica, permitem uma entrega \n\nespec\u00edfica e, consequentemente, um aumento na transfe\u00e7\u00e3o celular. Assim sendo, este \n\ntrabalho teve como segundo objetivo a formula\u00e7\u00e3o de nanopart\u00edculas de carbonato de \n\nmagn\u00e9sio (MgCO3) e gelatina, funcionalizadas com os ligandos de manose e galactose para \n\ndirecionar as nanopart\u00edculas para as c\u00e9lulas alvo (c\u00e9lulas dendr\u00edticas). Em termos da \n\nmorfologia, as imagens obtidas na microscopia eletr\u00f3nica de varrimento (SEM) e na \n\nmicroscopia eletr\u00f3nica de transmiss\u00e3o (TEM) permitiram concluir que todos os sistemas \n\nadquirem uma forma arredondada. Foi tamb\u00e9m calculada a efici\u00eancia de encapsula\u00e7\u00e3o (EE) \n\ndos diferentes sistemas com diferentes quantidades de pDNA, constatando-se que o sistema \n\n\n\n vii \n\ncom 5 ?g de pDNA possibilitou uma melhor encapsula\u00e7\u00e3o (cerca de 87%). Para al\u00e9m disso, a \n\ngelatina permitiu diminuir o tamanho m\u00e9dio das nanopart\u00edculas e a funcionaliza\u00e7\u00e3o com os \n\nligandos de manose e galactose n\u00e3o aumentou significativamente o tamanho das \n\nnanopart\u00edculas de gelatina, estando os valores entre 99,7 nm e 237,4 nm. Por fim, os valores \n\ndo potencial zeta foram positivos, o que sugere uma intera\u00e7\u00e3o facilitada das nanopart\u00edculas \n\ncom a membrana celular que \u00e9 carregada negativamente, possibilitando uma transfe\u00e7\u00e3o mais \n\neficiente. Todos os sistemas estudados apresentam caracter\u00edsticas promissoras para um \n\nuptake celular adequado, o que foi comprovado pela transfec\u00e7\u00e3o de c\u00e9lulas HeLa. \n\nEm conclus\u00e3o, o presente trabalho mostrou que o monolito de arginina com bra\u00e7o espa\u00e7ador \n\npermitiu a purifica\u00e7\u00e3o do pDNA sc com um bom grau de pureza e recupera\u00e7\u00e3o e as \n\nnanopart\u00edculas de MgCO3 provaram ser um sistema de entrega eficiente, sendo uma estrat\u00e9gia \n\npromissora para o desenvolvimento de uma vacina de DNA eficaz contra infe\u00e7\u00f5es provocadas \n\npelo HPV. \n\nPalavras-chave \n\n \n\nCromatografia de afinidade; HPV; MgCO3; Monolito de arginina com bra\u00e7o espa\u00e7ador; \n\nNanopart\u00edculas; Plasm\u00eddeo superenrolado; Vacina de DNA plasm\u00eddico. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n viii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n ix \n\nAbstract \n\n \n\nHuman Papillomavirus (HPV) is worldwide sexually transmitted and associated with 99.7% of \n\ncervical cancer. The cancer progression is due to the expression of the oncoproteins E6 and \n\nE7, which can alter the cell cycle and are responsible for the viral replication and \n\ntransformation of host cells. The vaccines available are only preventive ones, it being \n\nnecessary to develop therapeutic ones, to prevent and treat a pre-existent infection. \n\nDeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) vaccination along with the use of plasmid DNA (pDNA) as a non-\n\nviral vector arises as a good strategy that can activate both humoral and cellular immune \n\nresponses, allowing the prevention and treatment of HPV infections. The combination of the \n\namino-acid affinity chromatography (AC) with the innovative monolithic supports appears as a \n\npromising approach to obtain highly purified supercoiled (sc) pDNA \u2013 the active biological \n\nconformation \u2013 with high purity and recovery. This allows the selective interaction of specific \n\nligands to the target biomolecule adding to the higher capacity of monoliths when compared \n\nto conventional chromatographic supports. Monoliths also allow the use of high flow rates, \n\nwhich allows a fast purification procedure and decreases the retention time of the target \n\nbiomolecule, avoiding its degradation. In the present work, different elution strategies \n\n(manipulation of sodium chloride (NaCl) concentrations and/or pH and competition) were \n\nexplored, in order to purify the supercoiled HPV-16 E6/E7\nMUT\n\n pDNA, by using the arginine \n\nmonolith with spacer arm. The best elution strategy applied on both laboratorial and \n\npreparative scales allowed the removal of impurities within the regulatory agency \n\nrecommendations, with 93.3% and 98.5% of purity degree, respectively. This reinforces the \n\napplicability of this monolith for the sc pDNA purification.  \n\nMoreover, only one in thousands naked plasmids presented to the cells reach the nucleus and \n\nare expressed. The use of nanoparticles is a valuable strategy that permits the protection of \n\nthe pDNA by avoiding the enzymatic degradation and facilitates the specific delivery, \n\nenhancing the cellular transfection. Thus, different magnesium carbonate (MgCO3) systems \n\nwere characterized regarding its encapsulation efficiency (around 87%), morphology (round \n\nshape), size (99.7-237.4 nm) and zeta potential (positive). These data suggest that the \n\ndeveloped nanoparticles are suitable for cellular uptake and thus appropriate for therapeutic \n\napplications. Additionally, in vitro studies accompanied with confocal microscopy were \n\nperformed, which revealed that all the formulated systems are able to transfect eukaryotic \n\ncells. \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n x \n\nKeywords \n\n \n\nAffinity chromatography;

Even though the risk of this infection remains during a woman\u2019s \n\nlifetime, it is often acquired by adolescents and young adults, especially in ages between 15 \n\nand 19 years old [2]. It can infect the anogenital region and other mucosal sites of the body \n\nand it can lead to vulvar/vaginal precancerous lesions, genital warts and respiratory \n\npapillomatosis and also different kinds of cancer, such as vulvar, vaginal, anal, penile or \n\ncervical cancer  [2, 3]. This last one represents the second largest cause of cancer death of \n\nwomen worldwide. In fact, the HPV DNA has been found in 99.7% of cervical cancer, being the \n\nmost common cause of mortality by this type of cancer \u2013 more than half a million cases, \n\n270.000 ending with death [4, 5]. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that this type of \n\ninfection might also affect fertility and change the efficacy of assisted reproductive \n\ntechnologies [1]. As listed before, HPV infections cause a large spectrum of epithelial lesions. \n\nThis happens because there are more than 150 different HPV types that have been already \n\nidentified based on DNA sequence analysis and each is associated with an infection at a \n\nspecific epithelial site [1, 3].  Of these, more than 30 cause cervical epithelium lesions and \n\nsome of these lesions can ultimately lead to cancer [6]. \n\nHPVs belong to Papovaviridae family [7]. They are divided into several groups or genera. The \n\ntwo main ones are the Alpha and the Beta Papillomaviruses. Beta Papillomaviruses are \n\nnormally associated to cutaneous infections and Alpha Papillomaviruses are associated to \n\ngenital/mucosal infections and they represent the largest group of HPVs. Some Alpha HPVs, \n\nsuch as HPV-2, can also include some cutaneous lesions, like common skin warts and are \n\nhardly ever related to cancer [6, 7]. According to their tendency to cause cervical cancer, \n\nthis group is then subdivided into those that have low risk, intermediate risk and high risk [8]. \n\nInside the high risk group, also called oncogenic group, HPV-16 is the most prevalent one and \n\nis responsible for nearly 60% of cervical cancer and HPV-18 is the second most common, \n\ncausing 10-20% of this type of cancer [3, 9]. The low risk type of HPVs usually causes genital \n\nwarts and it almost never progresses to cancer. The HPVs that belong to the other genera \n\ncause mostly cutaneous papillomas and verrucas, but not any type of cancer [3]. Seeing that \n\nHPV can induce a diversity of lesions and cancers and it is the responsible for the majority of \n\ncervical cancers, it has been studied increasingly and so have been the ways to prevent and \n\ntreat his consequences, like vaccination. \n\n1.1.1 HPV structure and genome organization \n\nHPV is small, with approximately 55 nm in diameter, does not have any envelope and has an \n\nicosahedral capsid composed of 72 capsomers. His DNA is double-stranded and circular, with \n\n\n\n 2 \n\naround 8000 base pairs (bp) [10, 11]. HPV genome is divided into three main regions: the long \n\ncontrol region (LCR), that covers about 10% of the genome, the region of the early genes, \n\nover 50% of the genome, and the region of the late genes, almost 40% of the genome (figure \n\n1) [12] . These two last regions are generally called open reading frames (ORFs) [10]. \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Genome and structural organization of the HPV-16. The HPV-16 genome is represented as a \n\nblack circle with the early (p97) and late (p670) promoters marked by arrows. The early genes (E1, E2, \n\nE4 and E5) are represented in green and the early genes (E6 and E7) in red. The late genes (L1 and L2) \n\nare represented in yellow. The LCR is presented between yellow and red regions [6]. \n\nThe LCR is a segment of about 850 bp next to the origin of viral replication. This part of the \n\ngenome does not encode any protein, but despite that it is also relevant since it has several \n\nbinding sites for a lot of different transcriptional repressors and activators, including the \n\nactivator protein 1 (AP1), the keratinocytic-specific transcription factor 1 (KRF l), nuclear \n\nfactor (NF-I/CTF) and some viral transcriptional factor that are encoded by the early region. \n\nFor this reason, the LCR regulates the transcription of the early and late regions, hence it \n\ncontrols the expression of viral proteins and infectious particles. The host range of specific \n\nHPV types is quite determined by LCR, since it has the capacity for binding so many \n\ntranscription factors [11]. \n\nThe segments of the genome that actually encode proteins are called ORFs. The late gene \n\nregion has two of this ORF and encodes for two proteins: the L1 protein and the L2 protein. \n\nThese two proteins are the structural components that form the viral capsid and are only \n\nexpressed in productive infected cells [10, 13]. The L1 protein is the major viral capsid \n\nprotein and is highly conserved through the different Papillomavirus species. In turn, the L2 \n\nprotein is the minor viral capsid protein and has much more sequence variation amongst HPV \n\ntypes than the L1 protein [11]. Their expression is tightly regulated and linked to the \n\ndifferentiation of infected epithelial cells [4]. \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nThe early gene region encodes for viral replication and cellular transformation and it consists \n\nof six ORFs: the E1, E2, E4, E5, E6 and E7 (table 1) [10, 12]. Depending on the HPV type, the \n\nE4, E5 and E7 genes usually encode for a single polypeptide, while the E1, E2 and E6 genes \n\ncan suffer different splicing and so be expressed as several related polyproteins [14]. \n\nThe E1 gene is expressed in 68 and 27 kDa polypeptides. The 68 kDa protein has adenosine \n\ntriphosphatase (ATPase) and helicase activities and it can bind to specific sequences within \n\nthe LCR so the DNA replication starts [14]. The HPV E2 gene encodes for two proteins that, \n\nalong with E1, are necessary for extrachromosomal DNA replication [11]. The E2 proteins have \n\nfrom 370 to 430 amino acids in length and DNA binding domains, that can function as \n\ntranscriptional activators or repressors \u2013 they are the major regulator in virus transcription \n\nand genome replication [14]. \n\nThe HPV E4 protein seems to have an important role on the maturation, replication of the \n\nvirus and the release on the HPV particles and, like the L1 and L2 capsid proteins, it is only \n\nexpressed in later stages of the infection, at the assembly of the complete virions [11, 14]. \n\nApparently, this protein does not transform the cells, but it can associate with cellular \n\nmembranes and accumulate in the cytoplasm, inducing the collapse of the cytoplasmic \n\ncytokeratin network, in human keratinocytes, promoting the necessary conditions to the \n\nrelease of the virions [15]. \n\nThe HPV E5 is a small polypeptide with highly conserved 44-80 amino acids [14]. Usually, the \n\nE5 gene is not expressed in cervical carcinoma cells, suggesting that is not essential in the \n\nmalignant transformation of the host cell and thus its exact role in human cancers is yet to be \n\nknown. Despite this, it is already established that E5 interacts with cell membrane receptors, \n\nlike epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor ? and colony stimulating factor, \n\nstimulating the cell proliferation of HPV infected cells [11, 15]. \n\nLastly, the E6 and E7 genes express two oncoproteins indispensable for the viral replication \n\nand the host cell immortalization and transformation [15]. These are pleiotropic proteins, \n\nsince they can make transmembrane signaling, regulate cell cycle, immortalize primary cell \n\nline and regulate chromosomal stability [16].  \n\nThese two proteins are considered tumorigenic, because they have the capacity to bind to \n\nsome tumor suppressor proteins, like p53 and retinoblastoma protein (pRb), consequently \n\npreventing the HPV infected cell\u2019s apoptosis and enhancing their malignant conversion [13]. \n\nThe function of E6 and E7 will be detailed in next chapters. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 4 \n\nTable 1 - A summary of the HPV ORFs (adapted from [14]). \n\nViral protein Function \n\nL1 Major capsid protein \n\nL2 Minor capsid protein \n\nE1 Viral DNA synthesis \n\nE2 Transcription regulation \n\nE4 Disrupts cytokeratins, late protein \n\nE5 Interacts with growth factor receptors \n\nE6 Transforming protein; binds and initiates p53 degradation \n\nE7 Major transforming protein; binds pRb, p103 and p107 \n\n \n\n1.1.1.1 E6 oncoprotein \n\nThe E6 protein has approximately 150 amino acid residues and 18 kDa and it can be found in \n\nthe nuclear matrix and other nonnuclear membranes [17, 18]. E6 and E7 proteins bind to zinc \n\nion through the coordination of cysteine residues [19]. The E6 contains four Cys-X-X-Cys \n\nmotifs that form two zinc-binding domains, joined by an interdomain linker of 36 amino acids \n\n[19, 20]. E3 ubiquitin ligase, also known as E6 associated protein (E6AP), forms a complex \n\nwith both E6 and some target proteins. The motif through which there is a binding between \n\nE6, E6AP and the target proteins is referred to as LXXLL motif and is conserved throughout \n\nthe E6 proteins of numerous Papillomaviruses. Another motif that all high risk E6 proteins \n\nhave is referred to as XT/SXV and it is responsible for the binding to specific domains on \n\ncellular proteins that are known as PDZ proteins. Some other proteins, namely p53, Bak and \n\nprocaspase 8, do not have the LXXLL nor the PDZ domain, nevertheless they bind to E6 \n\nprotein, possibly through other yet undefined motifs or indirectly through binding to E6AP or \n\nother E6 associated proteins. As mentioned above, the E6 protein can interact with a wide \n\nnumber of target proteins, but the most well studied E6-protein interaction is with the p53 \n\ntumor suppressor protein [19]. \n\np53 is a nuclear protein that functions as a transcriptional factor and regulates the \n\ntranscription of various downstream target genes, which controls cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, \n\nDNA repair, senescence and metabolism [21]. The increase of p53 is triggered by cellular \n\ndamage and it activates pathways for DNA repairs, cell arrest and/or apoptosis [19]. When \n\nthere is damage in the DNA, p53 induces cell growth arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, \n\nso it can be repaired. This is important for the genomic integrity maintenance [11]. \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nTherefore, by targeting p53 for degradation and so interfering with its biological function, E6 \n\npromotes cell transformation and proliferation. This degradation occurs via the formation of \n\nthe complex that includes p53, E6 and E6AP, causing the transfer of ubiquitin peptides to \n\np53, which marks it for degradation by a proteasome. Low risk HPV E6 cannot target p53 for \n\ndegradation by the proteasome as it happens with the high risk HPV E6. In this way, the E6 \n\ndisturbs the control of the cell cycle progression, leading to an increase of tumor cell growth \n\nat the end (figure 2) [16]. \n\n \n\nFigure 2 - Representation of the E6 protein-p53 tumor suppressor protein interaction. The E6 binds \n\nto E6-AP and to p53, which gets marked for ubiquitination mediated by the E6-AP and then suffers \n\nproteasomal degradation [16]. \n\n1.1.1.2 E7 oncoprotein \n\nThe E7 protein has approximately 100 amino acids and 25 kDa and its found mostly in the \n\nnucleus, but also in the soluble cytoplasmic fraction and nucleolus [22, 23].  There are three \n\ndomains in the E7 protein called conserved regions (CR) \u2013 (CR1, 2 and 3) [24]. Two of these \n\nregions, the CR1 and CR2, share homology with SV40 T antigen and adenovirus E1A [25]. This \n\nhomology is also conserved amongst different HPV E7 proteins and are separated by a non-\n\nconserved sequence of variable size and amino acid composition [22]. Both CR1 and CR2 are \n\nnecessary for cellular transformation [26]. CR1 can stimulate the cellular transformation in a \n\npRb-binding independent way, whereas CR2 associates with pRb through the conserved LXCXE \n\n(Leu-X-Cys-X-Glu) motif [25]. The HPV E7 protein is capable of associating with a group of \n\nproteins known as pocket protein family, such as the pRb and its related proteins p107 and \n\np130, which act as negative regulators of cell growth, including in the G0/G1, G1/S and G2/M \n\ntransitions [16, 18]. \n\nIn a normal biological situation, when the pRb is hypophosphorylated, it binds to transcription \n\nfactors of the E2F family. As these transcriptional factors are responsible for regulating the \n\n\n\n 6 \n\nexpression of cellular genes that are involved in the DNA synthesis, like the DNA polymerase, \n\nby blocking its functions, the hypophosphorylated pRb negatively controls the progression of \n\nthe cell cycle. As mentioned earlier, the E7 is able to form complexes with the pRb and its \n\nrelated proteins, preventing them to bind to the E2F that is now free to activate and \n\nstimulate the expression of several host genes necessary for DNA replication, allowing the cell \n\nto proliferate [11, 18]. It has been shown that the ability to disrupt the E2F-pRb complex is \n\nbigger for the high risk HPV E7 than it is for the low risk HPV E7 (figure 3) [25]. \n\n \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Representation of the E7 protein-pRb protein. In physiologic conditions, the \n\nhypophosphorylated pRb form complexes with E2F, negatively regulating the progression of the cell \n\ncycle. When the infection occurs, the E7 binds to the hypophosphorylated pRb, which inhibits its binding \n\nto the E2F that stays free to stimulate transcription of DNA synthesis genes, allowing the cell cycle to \n\nprogress [16]. \n\n1.1.2 Preventive Vaccines \n\nIt has been reported that HPVs are associated with approximately 99% of cervical cancers, \n\nparticularly HPV type 16. Thus, HPV is a potential target for development of vaccines, being \n\nnecessary a basic understanding of HPV biology [4]. There are two types of vaccines that can \n\nbe used in cervical cancer or other HPV-associated malignancies. The first strategy is to \n\nprevent infection with preventive vaccines that are based on HPV virus-like particles \n\ncontaining HPV structural proteins and can generate neutralizing antibodies to block HPV \n\ninfection. The second one is to eliminate HPV infection by inducing a virus-specific T cell-\n\nmediated response by the use of therapeutic vaccines [4, 10]. \n\nAt present, there are two preventive vaccines (bivalent and quadrivalent) against HPV \n\ninfection, also called prophylactic vaccines, both approved by the Food and Drug \n\nAdministration (FDA) [3]. The quadrivalent one is called Gardasil\u00ae, developed by Merck (NJ, \n\nUSA), and is expressed in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [27]. Gardasil\u00ae acts successfully \n\nagainst infection by four of the most clinically relevant HPV types: the low risk HPV-6 and 11 \n\nand the high risk HPV-16 and 18 [10, 28]. The bivalent vaccine is called Cervarix\u00ae, developed \n\n\n\n 7 \n\nby GlaxoSmith-Kline (GlaxoSmith-Kline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium), and is expressed in an \n\ninsect cell system [27]. This vaccine protects against HPV-16 and 18 and also does partial \n\ncross-protection against HPV-31 and 45, which are phylogenetically related to the two \n\nprevious ones [28].  \n\nBoth Gardasil\u00ae and Cervarix\u00ae contain a non-infectious recombinant L1 virus-like protein with \n\nthe aim to generate neutralizing antibodies against major capsid protein, L1 [4]. They are \n\nhighly immunogenic, have high avidity for the systemic antibody response and are capable of \n\nproducing memory of B cell response, which enables the cell to make a rapid burst of \n\nantibodies upon a secondary exposure [10, 29]. Despite the L1 is not expressed in the basal \n\ncells infected with HPV, it still is deeply studied and targeted for preventive vaccines [4]. \n\nHowever, preventive vaccines are limited in their action to few types of HPVs, they do not \n\nhave therapeutic effects against pre-existing HPV infections nor HPV-associated lesions and \n\nthe vaccination program has relatively high cost [4, 30]. \n\n1.1.3 Therapeutic vaccines \n\nAs the name implies, preventive vaccines only have a preventive effect and can only be \n\napplied before the infection, unlike the therapeutic ones that can eliminate pre-existing \n\nlesions and even malignant tumors. To do that, it is important to select the ideal target \n\nantigen. As described above, HPV early proteins are expressed throughout the virus life cycle \n\nand help regulate progression of the disease. In particular, the HPV E6 and E7 proteins are of \n\ngreat interest for potential targets as they are essential to induce and maintain the cellular \n\ntransformation and malignancy [31].  \n\nNevertheless, before using E6 and E7 in DNA vaccines for human application and regarding \n\nsafety, there is the need to eradicate their oncogenic potential. There are two ways to \n\naccomplish this: the first and most used one is to introduce point mutations that have been \n\nreported to prevent interaction of E6 with p53 and E7 with pRb. The second method is called \n\n\u2018gene-shuffling\u2019 and involves the rearrangement of the primary gene sequences, so the ligand \n\nbinding domains are disrupted. To be sure that no loss of possible T-cell epitopes is caused, \n\nthe original sequence junctions that are destroyed are added as an appendix [32]. \n\n1.2 DNA technology \n\nIn the last decades, the knowledge about genes and their function augmented significantly, \n\nallowing the  discovery of recombinant DNA technology and gene cloning, in the 80s, and the \n\nincrease in genomics data, in the 90s [33]. The decoding of the entire human genome has \n\nprovided the knowledge to define some disease-causing genetic factors and the association \n\nbetween DNA (genes) and proteins have generated a fullness of potential therapeutic \n\nopportunities based on engineered genes and cells [33, 34]. \n\n\n\n 8 \n\nDespite the evolution on the Biotechnology field, a great number of diseases are yet to be \n\nconquered, with millions of people dying each year due to the inefficiency of the current \n\ntherapeutic methods [35]. To overcome the demands of present and emerging public health \n\nproblems, some innovative therapeutic strategies are being developed, like gene therapy and \n\nDNA vaccines, that seem to be really promising [36]. \n\n1.2.1 Gene therapy \n\nGene therapy is the transfer of genetic material (DNA) to cells that have defective or mutant \n\ngenes, creating a therapeutic effect, by either assisting or replacing the genetic defects or by \n\noverexpressing proteins that are therapeutically useful [33, 36]. By the definition of United \n\nStates FDA, gene therapy is the product \u201cthat mediate their effects by transcription and/or \n\ntranslation of transferred genetic material and/or by integrating into the host genome and \n\nthat are administered as nucleic acids, viruses, or genetically engineered microorganisms\u201d \n\n[37]. Therefore, gene therapy uses genes as a medicine to cure, or at least to improve the \n\nclinical status of a patient, a broad spectrum of serious acquired and inherited diseases, \n\nnamely cancer, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), cardiovascular diseases, \n\ninfectious diseases and other [38, 39]. However, this is a complex process, since there is the \n\nneed to ensure the arrival of the transgene into the nucleus without suffering any \n\ndegradation. To overcome this obstacles, namely the degradation and the passing through the \n\nplasma membrane to the nucleus, it is necessary to use a gene delivery system [39]. This \n\ntopic will be discussed later. \n\nGene therapy is generally classified into two categories according to the nature of the \n\ntargeted cell: germ line gene therapy and somatic gene therapy. In the first one, the \n\nfunctional gene is inserted in the reproductive cells, like sperm or zygote, and thus it will be \n\nintegrated into the individual genome and the modification might pass along to the next \n\ngeneration. In the second one, the transgene is inserted in the somatic cells (non-\n\nreproductive cells), narrowing the effects and modifications to the specific individual, not \n\npassing to the next generation. So far, the legislation only allows the use of somatic gene \n\ntherapy, due to ethical reasons [37, 39]. The somatic gene therapy may also be divided into \n\ntwo different approaches: ex vivo, where the cells are removed from the patient\u2019s body, \n\ngenetically manipulated and then returned to the patient\u2019s body, and in vivo, where the cells \n\nmanipulation occurs in the patient\u2019s body. Both are under investigation and their great goal is \n\nto successfully deliver therapeutic genetic material to the target cells [40]. \n\nIt is important to refer that up until now cancer composes over 60% of all ongoing clinical \n\ntrials on gene therapy, followed by monogenetic and cardiovascular disease, being by far the \n\nmost common disease treated by gene therapy [37]. \n\n \n\n\n\n 9 \n\n1.2.2 DNA vaccines \n\nLooking back to the past century, it can be said that the development and widespread use of \n\nvaccines against a large number of infectious agents have been a great triumph of medical \n\nscience. It all started over 200 years ago when Jenner succeeded to show that prior exposure \n\nto cowpox could prevent infection by smallpox, emerging the concept of vaccination [41]. \n\nDespite this progress, as mentioned above, some diseases still cause death to millions of \n\npeople. Hence, the world urgently requires new technologies able to respond quicker and \n\nthat are able to be developed faster for new vaccines. An opportunity to answer this matter \n\nrelies on DNA vaccines [42]. The DNA vaccination is a recent therapeutic strategy that is \n\nbased on the use of a vector that encodes one or more antigens corresponding to the \n\nprotein(s) of interest under a promoter, capable of function in the transferred cells [43].  \n\nCompared to the conventional vaccines, DNA vaccines have some advantages that are worth \n\nto considered, as briefly presented in table 2. A big difference between them is that the \n\ngene-based vaccines can generate both humoral and cellular immune responses [44]. \n\nTable 2 - Advantages of DNA vaccination (adapted from [45]). \n\nAdvantages of DNA vaccines comparing with conventional vaccines \n\nDesign DNA vector optimization through codon and ribonucleic acid (RNA) structure \n\nchanges \n\nCan generate effective cytotoxic T lymphocyte and antibody responses \n\nCan be engineered to express tumor antigenic peptides or proteins \n\nEnables prolonged expression of antigens and enhancement of immunologic memory \n\nSafety Unable to revert into virulent forms, unlike live vector\u2013based vaccines \n\nCapacity for repeated administration safely and effectively \n\nNo significant adverse events in any clinical trial \n\nStability Temperature-stable \n\nLong shelf life \n\nManufacture Suitable for large scale production at high purity \n\nRapid production and formulation \n\nEasy to store and transport \n\n \n\nThe DNA vaccination is capable of inducing the adaptive immunity, while producing \n\nantibodies and activating helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells, and even the innate immunity \n\n[46]. Upon DNA vaccine transfection, the host cell transcribes, translates and expresses the \n\nviral antigen [47]. When professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) encounter an exogenous \n\n\n\n 10 \n\nand foreign antigen, they take it up into their endolysosomal pathway. The protein is then \n\nprocessed and degraded to peptide fragments that are loaded and presented on the cell \n\nsurface by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II [35, 48]. This antigen peptide-\n\nMHC class II complex is recognized by specific helper T cells, the CD4+ T cells that can \n\nproduce cytokines that will help in other cell activities. For example, they can help B cells \n\ngenerate effective antibody responses and/or help cytolytic T lymphocyte responses, \n\ndepending on the cytokine [35, 41]. This via is known as humoral response (figure 4). \n\nConsidering the antibody responses, B cells recognize and respond to extracellular antigens or \n\nexposed extracellularly antigens that belong to transmembrane proteins [35]. \n\nOn the other hand, there is the cellular response, where the foreign protein can be \n\nintracytoplasmic and so it is processed by the proteosome into peptide fragments. The \n\npeptide fragments associate to MHC class I molecules, transported to the cell membrane and \n\nthen are presented on the APC surface. This peptide-MHC class I complex is recognized by \n\ncytolytic T lymphocytes, the CD8+ T cells, that become activated also by the action of co-\n\nstimulatory molecules (figure 4) [35, 48]. \n\n \n\nFigure 4 - Representation of the mechanisms of both humoral and cellular immune responses. DNA \n\nvaccination aims these two responses. If the foreign antigen is exogenous, it will be taken up by \n\nprofessional APCs into its endolysosomal pathway. The protein is degraded to peptide fragments, which \n\nare presented by the MHC-II and recognized by CD4+ T cells. These are activated to produce cytokines \n\nthat help B cells to become activated and produce antibodies (humoral response) and also help cytolytic \n\nT cells response. The antigen can likewise be intracytoplasmic, being degraded by the proteosome into \n\nfragment peptides that are presented by the MHC-I to the CD8+ T cell, leading to its activation (cellular \n\nresponse) [35]. \n\n1.2.3 DNA delivery systems \n\nThe delivery of naked DNA to target cells for therapeutic purposes has its drawbacks, as it is \n\nsusceptible of degradation by endonucleases, its crossing through the cell membranes is \n\n\n\n 11 \n\nlimited by its net negative surface charge and large hydrodynamic diameter and if it is \n\nendocytosed it may be degraded by the endolysosome. To ensure that none of these occurs, it \n\nis imperative to use a DNA delivery system [49]. The ideal DNA delivery system, also known as \n\nvector, must not trigger a strong immune response, it must be capable of transporting the \n\nDNA independently of its size and deliver the transgene to target cells, it must be episomal or \n\nintegrate into a specific genome region without randomly integration and it must be easily \n\nprepared, not expensive and available at high concentrations commercially [39]. Currently, \n\nthere are two types of available vehicles for gene delivery: the viral and nonviral vectors \n\n[50]. \n\n1.2.3.1 Viral vectors \n\nViruses have a number of biological properties that made them one of the first choices for \n\ngene delivery vehicles: they can recognize and enter cells, specifically penetrate into the \n\nhost cell nucleus and then take advantage of the cellular machinery and express its own \n\ngenetic material and replicate it in the host cell and spread to other cells [39, 51]. Before \n\nusing a virus as a gene transfer vector, it must be modified by genetic engineering, in order to \n\nreduce patho/immunogenicity. To accomplish this, the dispensable and pathogenic genes are \n\nremoved and replaced by the gene(s) of interest. On the other hand, the viral genes that are \n\nnecessary for the assembly of viral particles, the packing of the viral genome into particles \n\nand the therapeutic gene delivered to the target cells still remain in the vector construction \n\n[39, 50]. The main viruses used on gene delivery are adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, \n\nlentivirus, retrovirus and also herpes simplex virus. These viral vectors are the most used \n\nsystem to transfer genes, because they have high transfection efficiency, but they also have \n\nsome downsides, as briefly presented in table 3 [39]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 12 \n\nTable 3 - Advantages and disadvantages of the main viral vectors [34]. \n\nViral vector Advantages Disadvantages \n\nAdenovirus \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHigh transfection efficiency \n\nTransfects proliferating and non-\nproliferating cells \n\nSubstantial clinical experience \n\nStrong immune response \n\nInsert size limit of 7.5 kbp \n\nDifficult to manufacture and quality control \n\nPoor storage characteristics \n\nShort duration of expression \n\nRetrovirus High transfection efficiency \n\nFairly prolonged expression \n\nLow immunogenicity \n\nSubstantial clinical experience \n\nLow transfection efficiency in-vivo \n\nInsert size limit of 8 kbp ex-vivo \n\nTransfects only proliferating cells \n\nDifficult manufacture and quality control \n\nSafety concerns (mutagenesis) \n\nLentivirus  Transfects proliferating and non-\ncells \n\nTransfects haematopoietic stem \ncells \n\nVery difficult manufacture and quality \ncontrol \n\nPoor storage characteristics \n\nInsert size limit of 8 kbp \n\nNo clinical experience \n\nSafety concerns (origins in HIV) \n\nAdeno-\nassociated virus \n\nEfficient transfection of wide \nvariety of cell types in-vivo \n\nProlonged expression \n\nLow immunogenicity \n\nDifficult manufacture and quality control \n\nInsert size limit of 4.5 kbp \n\nSafety concerns (mutagenesis) \n\nLimited clinical experience \n\n \n\n1.2.3.2 Nonviral vectors \n\nAs presented in table 3, the viral vectors have disadvantages that have to be seriously \n\nconsidered, like the capacity to cause several immune responses. This has led to the need of \n\nfinding safer alternatives and nonviral vector delivery systems are emerging as a favorable \n\nsolution to overcome some of the viral vector drawbacks [52]. Comparing to viral vectors, the \n\nnonviral vectors are relatively safe, have low immunogenicity and less toxicity, have easy \n\nformulation and assembly and can be prepared in large quantities at low cost. Furthermore, \n\nthey are capable of transferring different and larger therapeutic genes, with no limit on size, \n\n\n\n 13 \n\nand because of their stability they can be stored for long periods [34, 39]. Unfortunately, \n\ntheir use in large amounts is limited by their low transfection efficiency [39]. \n\nThere are two categories when considering nonviral DNA delivery systems: the physical and \n\nthe chemical one. The physical approach is applied when the DNA delivery into the target \n\ncells is made by the use of physical forces that weakens the cell membrane, causing it to be \n\ntemporarily permeable, which facilitates the diffusion of the transgene. This process is not \n\nmediated by a carrier. The physical methods include needle injection, electroporation, gene \n\ngun, ultrasound and hydrodynamic injection. The chemical approach occurs when the DNA is \n\ndelivered into the target cell nucleus by a carrier that can be prepared by several types of \n\nchemical reactions [39, 53]. Within this group, the most studied strategy so far has been the \n\nformulation of DNA into condensed particles by using cationic lipids or cationic polymers. \n\nHence, these particles suffer cell endocytosis, macropinocytosis or phagocytosis as \n\nintracellular vehicles, from which a small part of the DNA is released into the cytoplasm and \n\nmigrates into the nucleus, where the therapeutic gene is expressed [53]. Our research group \n\nhas been conducting several studies with nanoparticles, including chitosan nanoparticles for \n\nthe delivery of p53 sc pDNA [54]. The subject-matter of nanoparticles will be discussed later. \n\n1.3 Plasmid DNA \n\nWithin the huge variety of vectors for gene delivery, there is the pDNA. Because of its safety, \n\nits easiness of production on a large-scale, its simple application and also the fact that it does \n\nnot cause toxicity, the pDNA has received an increased attention and has gained a huge \n\ninterest for therapeutic applications [49]. It is used to deliver the desired genetic information \n\ninto the target cells and to induce the production of the relevant proteins. Consequently, in \n\nthe past few years, the use of pDNA as a delivery system on approved gene-therapy protocols \n\nhas increased exponentially, representing 64.4% of the gene therapy clinical trials in 2016 \n\n[55]. \n\nPlasmids are double-stranded DNA molecules that are covalently closed. Each strand is a \n\nlinear polymer of deoxyribonucleotides that are linked by phosphodiester bonds, negatively \n\ncharged at pH>4 [42]. The two strands wind in an anti-parallel sense around each other and \n\naround a common axis that forms the double helix structure, stabilized by hydrogen bonds \n\nand stacking forces [56]. This structure has a hydrophilic backbone, composed by sugars and \n\nphosphate groups, and a hydrophobic interior, composed by planar aromatic bases stacked on \n\neach other. pDNA can have different sizes and normally they are small (2 to 20 kbp and a \n\nmolecular weight of 106 to 107 Daltons), although they are very large when compared with \n\nproteins [56, 57]. Despite this, in the future it will be needed multigene vectors, including \n\nextensive control regions, that may require the production of larger plasmids [58]. The pDNA \n\nmolecule can be coiled in space, causing the formation of a higher order molecule known as \n\nsc pDNA [56]. The active sc pDNA form, also called covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), is \n\n\n\n 14 \n\nthe main one, but under stress or unfavorable environment conditions, such as extreme pH or \n\nhigh temperature, it can generate other forms [57]. The other topological pDNA \n\nconformations can be the open circular (oc) or the linear form, caused by single-stranded and \n\ndouble-stranded nicks, respectively [42]. Linear and oc pDNA isoforms are formed by random \n\nnick(s) that might damage at different gene locations, such as the promoter or gene coding \n\nregions that become destroyed, and so they are inefficient to induce the expression of the \n\ntherapeutic gene [57]. Therefore, the sc pDNA is the most appropriate and desired form for \n\ntherapeutic applications [59]. \n\nBy estimates, it is known that only one per thousand plasmid molecules presented to the cells \n\nreaches the nucleus and is expressed [60]. Thus, there is the need to improve the current \n\nstrategies of sc pDNA production, so it may be of high copy number, highly pure and \n\nsuccessfully delivered to the targets cells. Moreover, it is also important to develop adequate \n\ndelivery systems that protect pDNA vector from degradation and also that facilitates the \n\nentrance and delivery to the nucleus of the higher number of pDNA. \n\n1.3.1 pDNA manufacture \n\nThe manufacture of pDNA is divided into three different stages: upstream processing, \n\nfermentation and downstream processing (figure 5). Firstly, there is the construction and \n\nselection of an appropriate plasmid vector and production of microorganisms, followed by \n\nselection and optimization of the fermentation conditions and cell growth and then the \n\nisolation and purification steps, with the aim of producing large quantities of stable and \n\nhighly purified sc pDNA [61]. \n\n \n\nFigure 5 - Representation of the three essential stages to obtain pure sc pDNA [61]. \n\nWhen the purpose is pDNA vaccination, the design of the pDNA vector must include some \n\ntypical elements, such as an origin of replication for efficient propagation in the adequate \n\n\n\n 15 \n\nhost cell, a selectable marker like an antibiotic resistance gene for growth selection, a strong \n\neukaryotic promoter to drive expression, a polyadenylation signal to terminate the \n\ntranscription and the transgene that encodes the antigen of interest (figure 6) [62]. \n\n \n\nFigure 6 - Representation of the construction of the plasmid DNA [62]. \n\nThe typical host used in fermentation is E. coli. To obtain the pDNA, the cells are usually \n\ndisrupted by alkaline lysis [56]. Unfortunately, the pDNA only represents around 3% \n\nmass/mass (w/w) of the E. coli extract [63]. To eliminate some of the impurities, it follows a \n\nprimary isolation process that involves clarification and concentration steps [57]. This allows \n\nthe removal of some impurities like RNA, genomic DNA (gDNA), endotoxins and proteins [63]. \n\nLastly, a chromatographic purification step is used to separate sc pDNA from structurally \n\nrelated impurities, like relaxed and denatured pDNA, gDNA, low molecular weight RNA and \n\nendotoxins [61]. \n\n1.3.2 pDNA purification \n\nWith the progress in therapeutic approaches, emerges the need to develop a good pDNA \n\npurification process, in order to obtain sc pDNA homogeneity near to 100% and to follow the \n\nquality specifications recommended by the regulatory agencies, such as FDA and the \n\nEuropean Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) [56, 64]. At present, liquid chromatography is \n\nthe central technology used in pDNA purification, as it is simple, robust, versatile and it has \n\nhigh resolution and high reproducibility [57, 65]. Despite its plusses, chromatography has a \n\nchallenge when it comes to the separation of pDNA from the contaminants, because they \n\nshare similar characteristics, like the negative charge (RNA, gDNA, endotoxins), similarity in \n\nsize (gDNA, endotoxins) and hydrophobicity (endotoxins) [63]. Numerous chromatography \n\nprocesses have been developed by exploring different properties including charge, molecular \n\nsize, hydrophobicity and affinity [56]. \n\n1.3.2.1 Size exclusion chromatography \n\nSize exclusion chromatography can fractionate and purify plasmids from a clarified lysate \n\nbased on the wide variety of molecular mass. The larger molecules, like pDNA and gDNA, are \n\n\n\n 16 \n\nincapable of penetrate the pores, eluting first, so they can be separated from the smaller \n\nones, like RNA, endotoxins and proteins [42, 57]. But because the lysate is a complex mixture \n\nof different molecules, the resolution here is limited, as well as the isolation of sc pDNA in \n\none single step [57]. \n\n1.3.2.2 Anion exchange chromatography \n\nAnion exchange chromatography is based on the interaction between the negatively charge \n\nphosphate groups in the DNA backbone and the positively charged ligands on the stationary \n\nphase [56]. After the binding occurs, it is applied an increasing salt concentration to displace \n\nand elute the different nucleic acids by order of an increasing overall net charge, which is \n\nfunction of chain length and conformation [65]. Given that sc pDNA is more compact and has \n\nhigher charge than the oc pDNA, it is possible to separate these two isoforms [42]. \n\nNevertheless, this type of chromatography presents poor selectivity towards pDNA and \n\nimpurities, like RNA, gDNA and endotoxins, due to their similar binding affinities, making the \n\npurification of pDNA insufficient [66]. \n\n1.3.2.3 Hydrophobic interaction chromatography \n\nHydrophobic interaction chromatography relies on the differences in the hydrophobic \n\ninteractions of pDNA, single-stranded nucleic acid and endotoxins, using high salt \n\nconcentration for the biomolecules retention [57]. To elute the bound species, the salt \n\nconcentration of the mobile phase is decreased, weakening the hydrophobic interactions and \n\nthe elution occurs by increasing the hydrophobicity order. This property is mainly defined by \n\nbase composition, size and structure [56, 57]. This technique is inefficient on separating \n\ndifferent pDNA isoforms and in addition the use of high salt concentration, which is associated \n\nwith higher costs and environmental impact, is also a downside [57, 67]. \n\n1.3.2.4 Affinity chromatography \n\nAffinity chromatography (AC) is a separation technique that exploits natural biological \n\nprocesses like molecular recognition for the selective purification of target biomolecules \n\nbased on their biological function or chemical structure [42]. The high specificity and \n\nefficiency of affinity interactions allow this method to eliminate additional steps, to increase \n\nyields and to improve process economics [57, 66]. Nonetheless, it has some limitations, as the \n\nfragility and low binding capacity of the biological ligands. To overcome this, synthetic \n\nligands were designed, combining the selectivity of natural ligands with the high capacity and \n\ndurability of synthetic systems [57]. \n\nThis purification method separates biomolecules based on reversible interactions between the \n\ntarget one and its specific ligand that is immobilized on the chromatographic matrix [57]. \n\nUnder appropriate pH and ionic strength, the sample is injected onto the column and the \n\ntarget biomolecule binds to the specific ligand [68]. After, elution steps are performed, being \n\n\n\n 17 \n\nspecific with a competitive ligand or non-specific with a change in pH, ionic strength or \n\npolarity, depending on the matrix and the characteristics of the biomolecule [57]. \n\nThe interactions between target biomolecule and its ligand result of the combination of \n\nelectrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions, van der Waals forces and/or hydrogen \n\nbonding. As these interactions are so specific, they represent a crucial advantage of AC, \n\nbecause they allow to obtain high selectivity and high resolution [57]. \n\nWithin AC, there are several types like immobilized metal-ion, triple-helix, polymyxin B, \n\nprotein-DNA and amino acid-DNA [57]. For the purpose of this project, we will only focus on \n\nthe last method. \n\n1.3.2.4.1 Amino acid-DNA AC \n\nThe use of amino acids in AC has already demonstrated to be efficient on the successful \n\nbiorecognition of the sc isoform, by using a single purification step. \n\nAmino acids have been of great use in biotechnology applications, since they are natural \n\ncompounds that can be safely used in pharmaceutical applications [42, 69]. Besides, based on \n\natomic studies, amino acids preferentially promote specific interactions with nucleic acid \n\nbases, especially the positively charged ones like histidine, lysine and arginine [69]. The use \n\nof these amino acids as ligands has allowed an efficient purification of sc pDNA and the \n\nrecognition of this isoform proved the presence of specific interactions between pDNA \n\nmolecule and the amino acid-based matrices [70]. \n\nIn fact, our research group has already showed the successful application of some amino acids \n\nfor the purification of pDNA. For instance, the use of lysine and histidine for the separation of \n\nsc pDNA from a clarified lysate sample resulted on a high purity degree of this biomolecule of \n\ninterest, being in accordance with the regulatory agencies specifications [64, 66, 71]. \n\nNonetheless, the overall recovery yield of these two strategies was low: 45% and 40%, \n\nrespectively [66, 71]. On the contrary, the use of arginine on the affinity chromatography \n\nresulted on a recovery of 79% of sc pDNA and also a high purity degree, under mild elution \n\nconditions, thus representing a smaller environmental impact [72].  \n\nTaking this into account, the arginine amino acid reveals itself to be a good affinity ligand to \n\npurify the sc pDNA, due to its high selectivity for the sc pDNA recognition and thus high \n\nrecovery and purity. Despite this, the conventional stationary phases have some drawbacks, \n\nlike the low capacity, working at low flow rates that results in longer retention time and \n\npossible degradation of the target biomolecule [73]. Consequently, raises the need to explore \n\nalternative chromatographic supports. \n\n \n\n\n\n 18 \n\n1.3.3 Monoliths: innovation on chromatographic supports \n\nAs discussed above, the studies with affinity matrices have revealed positive results, however \n\nthere are still some limitations to be surpassed. Monoliths have been gaining attention owing \n\nto their appealing properties. Considered the fourth generation of the chromatographic \n\nstationary phases, a monolith is a continuous and highly porous bed; the pore size is \n\nadjustable considering the desired application, depending on polymerization process [68, 70, \n\n74]. They are polymerized into a column as a single unit and thus the scale-up and scale-down \n\nvariations in packing quality and the need to repack the column because of the appearance of \n\nair bubbles are eliminated [74]. Monoliths exhibit increased permeability and \n\ninterconnectivity, allowing high mass transfer and more access to binding sites for the target \n\nbiomolecule, having a very high binding capacity for pDNA [68]. Additionally, this innovative \n\nsupport has flow independent resolution, allowing the same separation and resolution even \n\nworking at high flow rates. This enables a very fast separation and reduced retention time, \n\nwhich ensures less biomolecule degradation [70, 73, 74]. \n\nBearing all this positive characteristics in mind along with the amino acids\u2019, combining a \n\nmonolithic support with amino acids ligands or derivatives for the purification of sc pDNA \n\nusing AC has been a promising and favorable strategy. \n\nFor instance, our research group has already demonstrated that arginine monolith allows the \n\nseparation of a sc pDNA, at a laboratorial scale, with 86% of purity. This support was also \n\ncharacterized in terms of dynamic binding capacity (DBC), which has presented a higher value \n\nthat the equivalent conventional support [75]. On the other hand, agmatine and histamine \n\nmonoliths also revealed themselves to be efficient at separating sc pDNA, with 99.6% and \n\n96.66% of purity, respectively [76, 77]. Thus, the monolithic approach allows higher \n\nselectivity for the sc pDNA and higher binding capacity. \n\n1.4 Nanotechnology \n\nNanotechnology is a recent and promising field that involves multiple disciplines and within it \n\nthere is the Cancer Nanotechnology, which includes the use of nanoparticles to detect and \n\ntreat cancerous cells [78, 79]. As previously mentioned, estimates indicate that only one per \n\nthousand plasmid molecules presented to the cells reaches the nucleus and is expressed [60]. \n\nThus, there is the need to create and develop strategies that help protect vectors, like pDNA, \n\nfrom degradation and that facilitates the entrance into the nucleus. Nanoparticles emerge as \n\na good solution, offering many advantages over the delivery of free pDNA: they protect the \n\ntherapeutic cargo against enzymatic degradation; they allow more specific targeting and \n\ndelivery; by targeting to specific cells, there is an improvement of distribution and reduction \n\nof side-effects; the therapeutic cargo is more probably delivered to the desired intracellular \n\ncompartment, with an improvement of cellular penetration [80\u201382]. \n\n\n\n 19 \n\n1.4.1 Cellular trafficking of pDNA \u2013 barriers to cross \n\nThe pDNA vector comes across several physical barriers before it can finally enter the \n\nnucleus, where it should be expressed into the protein(s) of interest (figure 7). The first one \n\nis the plasma membrane, since it is negatively charged, like the pDNA, due to the \n\nglycosaminoglycan groups [80, 83, 84]. This causes electrostatic repulsions between the cell \n\nsurface and the pDNA, preventing the last to readily crossing the plasma membrane, thus \n\nlowering the number that can actually enter the cell. If pDNA is delivered by nanoparticles, \n\nits entrance into the cell is higher. In general, nanoparticles are immobilized on the cell \n\nsurface, due to non-specific electrostatic interactions or receptor-mediated ligand \n\ninteractions, and then suffer internalization via endocytosis [80, 84]. The uptake of \n\nnanoparticles can be facilitated and enhanced by \u2018active targeting\u2019, which is accomplished by \n\ncoupling ligands to them that must target them to specific cells, ensuring an efficient \n\ninternalization by endocytosis [80]. Endocytosis results in the formation of endosomal \n\nvesicles, which represent another barrier for an efficient transfection [84, 85]. These vesicles \n\n\u2013 endosomes \u2013 have an internal pH around 5 and mature from early to late endosomes, before \n\nfusing with lysosomes that contain digestive enzymes. Hence, it is crucial that the \n\nnanoparticles with the nucleic acid cargo escape the endosome promptly, avoiding the \n\nenzymatic degradation within the lysosomes [86]. A way to escape the endosome is increasing \n\nendosomal osmotic pressure [87]. Depending on several factors, like composition, some \n\nnanoparticles are dissolved in the low acidic medium of endosomes. An example of these \n\nnanoparticles is the inorganic ones, which will be presented later. This dissolution destabilize \n\nthe endosome through osmotic imbalance, disrupting the endosome membrane, enabling the \n\ncargo delivery into the cytosol [88]. Now, the pDNA must reach the nucleus for expression. \n\nThe nuclear membrane represents another barrier. The crossing of this membrane could be \n\nthrough the nuclear pores, but they are size-limited and generally too small for free diffusion \n\nof plasmids [80, 84]. Despite this, plasmids are capable of reaching the nucleus during \n\nmitosis, due to an increase in the nuclear permeability [89]. \n\n \n\n\n\n 20 \n\n \n\nFigure 7 - Representation of the cellular trafficking of pDNA within the nanoparticles and the \n\nbarriers that it has to overcome: 1 \u2013 crossing the plasma membrane; 2 \u2013 avoiding lysosomal \n\ndegradation; 3 \u2013 crossing nuclear membrane [90]. \n\n1.4.2 Nanoparticles \n\nAs mentioned before, nanoparticles have the main goal of protecting and helping the delivery \n\nof the therapeutic molecules, like the pDNA vector. Besides, the ideal nano-carrier presents \n\ngood biodistribution, has no toxicity with reduced side-effects and inflammation and allows \n\nthe therapeutic cargo to be delivered to a specific target cell [80]. These carriers can have \n\nseveral types of composition, like phospholipids, lipids, dextran, chitosan, polymers, carbon, \n\nsilica, metal and many other [81]. Taking into account the manufacturing method and the \n\nmaterial used, the nanoparticles can be of various shapes and sizes, along with diferent \n\ncharacteristics (figure 8) [91]. \n\n \n\nFigure 8 \u2013 Several examples of nanoparticles with diferent materials, sizes and structures [92]. \n\n\n\n 21 \n\nThe world of nanoparticles is tremendous and has developed a lot, however there is still much \n\nto improve and many limitations to overcome. For instance, some delivery systems still \n\npresent cytotoxicity and low amount of gene expression in the target cells [93]. The use of \n\ninorganic nanoparticles might eliminate limitations of other nano-carriers, because they have \n\ngood biocompatibility and low toxicity, mild preparation conditions, they are relatively \n\ninexpensive, they possess the ability for loading different therapeutic agents and a pH \n\ndependent dissolution that favors intracellular delivery [93\u201395]. Moreover, they are not \n\nsubjected to microbial attack and exhibit excellent storage ability, facts that cannot be \n\npointed out to the organic ones [93]. \n\n1.4.2.1 Mg2CO3 Nanoparticles \n\nNano-carriers based on calcium carbonate (CaCO3) have already been described as a good \n\ndelivery system [94, 96, 97]. Our research group has also obtained satisfactory results with \n\nthis system [95]. pDNA/CaCO3 nanoparticles are produced by co-precipitation of Ca\n2+\n\n, an \n\ninorganic cation, with DNA, in the presence of CO3\n2-\n, an inorganic anion. Taking into account \n\nthat these nanoparticles are already well-described and present good results, a small \n\nalteration can be performed to this delivery system - the Ca\n2+\n\n substitution by other divalent \n\nion, magnesium (Mg\n2+\n\n), to investigate if the pDNA/MgCO3 nanoparticles present even better \n\nresults at gene transfection. Although the co-precipitation technique is simple and rapid, it \n\ncan create precipitates, resulting in large nanoparticles, which in turn has negative effects on \n\nthe cellular uptake and gene transfection. Thus, to increase the stability and the transfection \n\nefficiency of the proposed nano-carrier, a cationic polymer, gelatin, can be added to the \n\nnanoparticles. The use of gelatin, a biocompatible and biodegradable polymer, leads to the \n\nformulation of nanoparticles with enhanced properties concerning size, surface charges and \n\ngene delivery efficiency [98]. \n\n\n\n 22 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 23 \n\nChapter II - Global aims \n\n \n\n \n\n \nThe main objective of the present work is to obtain a pure DNA vaccine to prevent or treat \n\nthe cervical cancer caused by HPV infection and create an appropriate delivery system that \n\ncan protect and specifically deliver the DNA vaccine. In order to achieve this purpose, the sc \n\npDNA must be highly pure, considering safety concerns recommended by the regulatory \n\nagencies. Hence, after the production of the pDNA in the recombinant E. coli host, the \n\npurification strategy has to be explored and optimized, maximizing the sc HPV-16 E6/E7\nMUT\n\n \n\npDNA recovery and purity degree. After the purification step, nano-carriers will be \n\nformulated with the purpose of protection, targeted delivery and enhancement of \n\ntransfection. Then, the nano-carriers will be characterized to assure that they have the best \n\nproperties and conditions to enhance the gene transfection and the therapeutic effects. At \n\nlast, the transfection efficiency will be evaluated. \n\nOverall, the goals are the optimization of the sc HPV E6/E7\nMUT\n\n pDNA purification by the \n\narginine monolith with spacer arm, the formulation of adequate nano-carriers for gene \n\ntransfection and evaluation of the gene transfection efficiency. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 24 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 25 \n\nChapter III \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n3.1 Materials \n\nThe chromatographic experiments were performed using the AKTA P\u00fcre system (GE \n\nHealthcare Biosciences Uppsala, Sweden), with a separation unit and a computer with \n\nUnicorn 6.3 software. Four epoxy monoliths (non-modified, modified with the 2-\n\nallyloxyethanol spacer arm, modified with arginine amino acid and modified with the 2-\n\nallyloxyethanol spacer arm and arginine) of 0.34 mL column bed volume were kindly prepared \n\nand provided by BIA Separations (Ajdov\u0161?ina, Slovenia). For the pDNA pre-purification, it was \n\nused the Qiagen Plasmid Purification Maxi Kit from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Ethylene-\n\ndiamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), NaCl and ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4) were acquired from \n\nPanreac (Barcelona, Spain) and tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (Tris) from Merck \n\n(Darmstadt, Germany). All of the solutions necessary for the chromatographic experiments \n\nwere prepared with deionized ultra-pure grade water, purified with Milli-Q system from \n\nMillipore (Billerica, MA, USA) and analytical grade reagents. The elution buffers were \n\npreviously filtered through a membrane with pores of 0.20 ?m (Schleicher Schuell, Dassel, \n\nGermany) and sonicated ultrasonically. For the gDNA quantification, it was used the iQ SYBR \n\nGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, EUA). \n\n3.1.1 Plasmid DNA \n\nThe 8.702 kbp HPV-16 E6/E7 plasmid vector was purchased from Addgene (plasmid 8641) \n\n(Cambrige, MA, USA) [99]. This vector contains the human beta-actin mammalian expression \n\npromotor and the ampicillin resistance gene (figure 9). \n\n \n\nFigure 9 - Representation of HPV-16 E6/E7 pDNA. \n\nE6 and E7 genes were mutated in different points to prevent the oncogenic role of the \n\nrespective proteins, thus avoiding the recognition by the p53 and pRb tumor suppressor \n\n\n\n 26 \n\nproteins. The HPV-16 E6/E7 mutated (HPV-16 E6/E7\nMUT\n\n) was prepared by NZYtech (NZYtech, \n\nLisbon, Portugal). \n\n3.2 Methods \n\n3.2.1 Bacterial growth conditions \n\nThe HPV-16 E6/E7\nMUT\n\n plasmid amplification was obtained by E. coli DH5? fermentation. The \n\ncells were plated on LB-agar medium with ampicillin and they grow overnight at 37 \u00baC. The \n\ncolonies were then inoculated in Terrific Broth medium (20 g/L tryptone, 24 g/L yeast \n\nextract, 4 mL/L glycerol, 0.017 M KH2PO4, 0.072 M K2HPO4), complemented with 100 ?g of \n\nampicillin/mL and the growth was run at 37 \u00baC, under 250 rpm shaking. The bacterial growth \n\nwas interrupted at the OD600?7 and the cells were recovered by centrifugation, at 3900 g for \n\n10 minutes (min) at 4 \u00baC and the pellets were stored at 20 \u00baC. \n\n3.2.2 Alkaline lysis with Qiagen Kit \n\nThe pDNA was obtained by alkaline lysis, with the Qiagen Plasmid Purification Maxi Kit, \n\nfollowing the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Then, the binding of pDNA to the \n\nQiagen Anion-Exchange columns was promoted under appropriate low salt concentrations and \n\npH conditions. After the binding of the pDNA to the columns, a wash was made under a \n\nmedium salt concentration, eluting the impurities (RNA, proteins and others impurities of low \n\nmolecular weight). To elute the pDNA, a buffer with high salt concentration was used. Lastly, \n\nthe pDNA was concentrated by isopropanol precipitation. The final pre-purified sample was \n\nused in some chromatographic experiments and DBC studies. \n\n3.2.3 Modified alkaline lysis \n\nThe cells obtained from fermentation were lysed by a modified alkaline lysis method [100], as \n\npreviously described [101]. The pellet was ressuspended in 20 mL of solution I (50 mM \n\nglucose, 25 mM Tris-HCl and 10 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). To perform the alkaline lysis, it was added \n\n20 mL of solution II (200 mM NaOH and 1% (w/v) sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS)) and incubation \n\nat room temperature during 5 min. To neutralize the previous solution, it was added 20 mL of \n\nsolution III (3 M potassium acetate, pH 5.0), followed by 20 min of incubation in ice. There \n\nwere made two centrifugations (30 min and 20 min), at 20 000 g and 4 \u00baC, with an AllegraTM \n\n25R centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA), so the cellular debris, some gDNA and \n\nproteins were eliminated. Then, to precipitate the pDNA, it was added 0.7 volumes of \n\nisopropanol and incubated in ice (30 min). The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation \n\n(16000 g, 30 min, 4 \u00baC). The resulting pellet was dissolved with 1 mL of 10 mM Tris and 10 mM \n\nEDTA (Tris-EDTA), pH 8.0. To precipitate protein and RNA, it was added ammonium sulfate up \n\nto a final concentration of 2.5 M and incubation in ice during 15 min. Next, impurities were \n\nremoved by centrifugation, 16000 g, 20 min, 4 \u00baC. To remove the salt, the sample was passed \n\nthrough the PD-10 column, using Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0 elution buffer, according to the \n\n\n\n 27 \n\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. EDTA was added to the elution buffers to stabilize the pDNA, \n\navoiding its degradation. \n\n3.2.4 Affinity Chromatography \n\nAll chromatographic experiments were performed using an AKTA Pure system. In order to \n\ncharacterize the chromatographic behavior of each monolith (non-modified, modified with \n\nthe 2-allyloxyethanol spacer arm, modified with arginine amino acid and modified with the 2-\n\nallyloxyethanol spacer arm and arginine) with a pre-purified pDNA sample, linear gradients \n\nwere performed by decreasing the ammonium sulfate concentration from 3 to 0 M or \n\nincreasing the NaCl concentration from 0 to 3 M. \n\nSeveral elution strategies were explored in the arginine monolith with spacer arm with a \n\nlysate sample, by increasing the NaCl concentration, pH manipulation from 6.5 to 9 and \n\naddition of arginine in the elution buffer as a competition agent, to determine the optimal \n\nconditions for the sc pDNA isolation. Thus, the sc pDNA purification was achieved at \n\nlaboratorial scale, by injection of 200 \u00b5L of lysate sample and by increasing stepwise gradient \n\nfrom 680 mM NaCl in Tris-EDTA, pH 7 to 649 mM and 1 M NaCl in Tris-EDTA, pH 7.5, at 1 \n\nmL/min. \n\nTo evaluate the applicability of arginine monolith with spacer arm in the sc pDNA purification \n\nat preparative scale, the column was equilibrated with the conditions described above and \n\noverloaded with 68 mL of lysate sample (5 ?g of pDNA/mL), prepared in the same equilibrium \n\nbuffer. After that, it was used the same elution strategy described above. All the experiments \n\nwere carried out at room temperature and the absorbance was constantly monitored at 260 \n\nnm. Fractions were collected according to the obtained chromatograms, concentrated and \n\ndesalted with Vivaspin\u00ae 6 Centrifugal Concentrator (Vivaproducts, Littleton, MA, USA) at 1000 \n\ng for further electrophoretic analysis and impurity (gDNA, proteins and endotoxins) \n\nquantification. \n\n3.2.5 Agarose gel electrophoresis \n\nThe pooled fractions from each chromatographic experiment were analyzed by horizontal \n\nelectrophoresis in a 15 cm long of 0.8% agarose gel (Hoefer, Holliston, MA, USA) and stained \n\nwith Greensafe (0.012 ?L/mL) (NZYTech, Lda. \u2013 Genes and Enzymes, Lisbon, Portugal). \n\nElectrophoresis was made at 120 V, during 30 min, with TAE buffer (40 mM Tris base, 20 mM \n\nacetic acid and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). The gel was then visualized under ultraviolet (UV) light \n\nin a FireReader (Uvitec Cambridge, UK). \n\n3.2.6 Supercoiled plasmid DNA quantification \n\nThe pDNA purity and recovery yield from the recovered fractions of the chromatographic \n\nexperiments were evaluated with the CIMac\u2122 pDNA analytical column, by applying a modified \n\n\n\n 28 \n\nanalytic method, as previously described [77] and using an AKTA purifier system (GE \n\nHealthcare Biosciences, Upssala, Sweden) with a Unicorn 5.11 software. A calibration curve \n\nwas constructed using pDNA standards from 1 to 50 \u00b5g/mL (figure 10). The pDNA standards \n\nwere obtained by dilution of the highest concentration of sc pDNA with 200 mM Tris-HCl, pH \n\n8.0, and the respective concentrations were confirmed by Ultrospec 3000 UV/Visible \n\nSpectrophotometer (Pharmacia Biotech, Cambridge, England). Firstly, the column was \n\nequilibrated with 600 mM NaCl in 200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 20 ?L of sample was injected, \n\nat 1 mL/min. After, a linear gradient from 600 mM to 700 mM NaCl in 200 mM Tris-HCl (pH \n\n8.0) was applied for 10 min, eluting all pDNA isoforms. Purity degree was calculated through \n\nthe ratio between sc pDNA peak area and total peak area in the analytical chromatogram and \n\nthe recovery yield through the ration between the recovered sc pDNA concentration and the \n\nsc pDNA concentration from the lysate sample. \n\n \n \n\nFigure 10- Calibration curve with pDNA standards (1 - 50 ?g/mL). \n\n3.2.7 Protein quantification \n\nThe protein concentration was measured by the micro-bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay \n\nfrom Pierce (Rockford, USA). The quantification consists on adding 50 ?L of each sample to \n\n200 ?L of BCA reagent in a microplate and 30 min of incubation at 60 \u00baC. Then, absorvance \n\nwas measured at 595 nm in microplate reader (Biochrom, Cambridge, United Kingdom). The \n\ncalibration curve was constructed with Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) (St. Louis, MO, United \n\nStates of America) as a standard protein (20-2000 ?g/mL) (figure 11). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 29 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 11 - Calibration curve with Bovine Serum Albumin standards (20 \u2013 2000 ?g/mL). \n\n3.2.8 Genomic DNA quantification \n\nThe quantification of gDNA was obtained by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a \n\niQS Multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection System (BioRad), according to instructions described \n\nby Martins et al. [102]. Sense (5\u2019-ACACGGTCCAGAACTCCTACG-3\u2019) and antisense (5\u2019- \n\nCCGGTGCTTCTTCTGCGGGTAACGTCA-3\u2019) primers were used to amplify a 181-bp fragment of \n\nthe 16S rRNA gene. PCR amplicons were quantified by following changes in fluorescence of \n\nthe DNA binding dye Syber Green I. The calibration curve was constructed by a serial of \n\ndilutions of the E. coli DH5? gDNA sample, purified with the Wizard gDNA purification kit \n\n(Promega) in the range of 0.005 to 50 ng/mL (figure 12). \n\n \n\nFigure 12 - Calibration curve of E. coli DH5? genomic DNA standards (0.005 \u2013 50 ng/mL). \n\n3.2.9 Endotoxin quantification \n\nEndotoxin content was measured by ToxinSensorTM Chromogenic Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate \n\n(LAL) Endotoxin Assay Kit from GenScrip (USA, Inc.), following the manufacturer\u2019s \n\ninstructions. The calibration curve was constructed with 10 EU/mL stock solution provided \n\nwith the kit (0.01-0.1 EU/mL) (figure 13). Samples to analyze and samples from the kit were \n\n\n\n 30 \n\ndiluted and dissolved, respectively, with non-pyrogenic water, which was also used as blank, \n\nto avoid external endotoxin interference. All tubs and tips or diluents used to perform this \n\nquantification must be endotoxin-free. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 13\u2013 Calibration curve of endotoxins standards (0.01 \u2013 0.1 EU/mL). \n\n3.2.10 Nanoparticle synthesis \n\nThe synthesis of the nanoparticles was based on the co-precipitation method previously \n\ndescribed [95]. Two solutions were prepared: solution A containing 5 ?g de pDNA, 96 ?L de \n\nMgCl2 (30 mg/mL) and 120 ?L of deionized water; solution B containing 255 ?L of NaCO3 (42.5 \n\n?g/mL), 5 ?L of deionized water, 5 ?L of gelatin (5 mg/mL) and 5 ?L of mannose or galactose \n\n(5 mg/mL). Solution A was added dropwise to solution B to form the nanoparticles. The new \n\nsolution was centrifuged at 13 000 rpm, for 15 min. The pellet containing the pDNA/MgCO3 \n\nnanoparticles was washed five times. \n\n3.2.11 Nanoparticles morphology \n\nThe nanoparticles morphology was analyzed by two equipments. For the first one, the pellet \n\nof nanoparticles was suspended in 40 ?L of tungsten 1% and diluted 1:20. 10 ?L of the \n\nrecently formed solution was set in roundly shaped cover-slip and incubated to dry, at room \n\ntemperature, overnight. On the following day, the nanoparticles are coated with gold using \n\nan Emitech K550 sputter coater (London, England) and analyzed by scanning electron \n\nmicroscope (SEM) (Hitachi S-2700, Tokyo, Japan), operated at an accelerating voltage of 20 \n\nkV with variable magnifications. For the second one, the pellet nanoparticles were suspended \n\nin deionized water, sonicated and analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) \n\n(Hitachi, Japan). \n\n3.2.12 Encapsulation Efficiency \n\nAfter the nanoparticles formulation and centrifugation, the supernatant was recovered. The \n\nsupernatant corresponds to the unbound pDNA that was not encapsulated by the MgCO3 \n\nnanoparticles. The concentration of the unbound pDNA was measured by Ultrospec 3000 UV-\n\n\n\n 31 \n\nVisible Spectrophotometer (Pharmacia Biotech, Cambridge, England), at 260 nm. Three \n\nindependent measurements were performed and the components of the nanoparticles without \n\nthe pDNA were used as blank. The encapsulation efficiency was determined by the following \n\nformula: \n\n \n\n   (1) \n\n \n\nSimilarly, galactose encapsulation efficiency was determined by using the equation above, \n\nwith pDNA being replaced by galactose. The non-incorporated galactose was determined \n\nquantitatively by using the Galactose Colorimetric/Fluorimetric Assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich). In \n\nthis assay kit, galactose is oxidized resulting in a colorimetric (570 nm)/fluorimetric (?ex = \n\n535nm/ ?ex = 587 nm) product, proportional to the galactose present. In this work, galactose \n\nhas been quantified by the colorimetric detection, measuring the absorbance at 570 nm. \n\n3.2.13 Nanoparticles Size and Zeta (?) Potential \n\nThe average size and the surface charges (? potential) of the nanoparticles were determined \n\nat 25 \u00baC, using a Zetasizer Nano ZS and a zeta dip cell. Determination of the nanoparticles \n\nsize was made by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a He-Ne laser 633 nm with non-invasive \n\nbackscatter optics (NIBS). For the ? potential determination, electrophoretic light scattering \n\nusing a patented laser interferometric technique named M3-PALS (Phase analysis Light \n\nScattering) was applied. It was used the Malvern Zetasizer software v6.34. The average values \n\nof size and ? potential were determined with the obtained data from three measurements and \n\nthe respective standard deviations (SD), presented as \u00b1 SD. \n\n3.2.14 Cell Culture \n\nHeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)-High Glucose Medium \n\n(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 10% (v:v) of fetal bovine serum (FBS) \n\nand a mixture of penicillin (100 ?g/mL) and streptomycin (100 ?g/mL). Fibroblasts were \n\ncultured in DMEM-F12, suplemented with 10% of FBS and a mixture of penicillin (100 ?g/mL) \n\nand streptomycin (100 ?g/mL). All cells were grown at 37 \u00baC in a humidified atmosphere with \n\n5% of CO2 in air. \n\n3.2.15 Cell Cytotoxicity \n\nBefore cell seeding, the plates were UV irradiated for 30 min. Human fibroblast cells were \n\nplated at confluency in 96 well plate, with 2\u00d710\n4\n per well, respectively, at 37 \u00baC in 5% CO2 \n\nhumidified atmosphere, for 24 and 48h. . The pDNA nanoparticles were applied to a 96-well \n\nplate (Nunc.) After incubation, the redox activity was assessed through the reduction of the \n\n3-[4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). 100 ?L of MTT dye \n\nsolution (0.05 mg/mL in Krebs) was added to each well, followed by incubation for 2 h at 37 \n\n\u00baC, in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The medium was aspirated and the cells were treated with 50 ?L \n\n\n\n 32 \n\nof isopropanol/HCl (0.04 N) for 30 min. Absorbance at 570 nm was measured using a Biorad \n\nMicroplate Reader Benchmark. The spectrophotometer was calibrated to zero absorbance \n\nusing the culture medium without cells. The relative cell viability (%) related to control wells \n\nwas calculated by: \n\n                                                               (2) \n\nwhere [A] test is the absorbance of the test sample and [A]control is the absorbance of the \n\ncontrol sample. All the experiments were repeated three times. The statistical analysis of \n\nexperimental data used the Student\u00b4s t-test and the results were presented as mean \u00b1 SD. \n\nStatistical significance was accepted at a level of p &lt;0.05. \n\n3.2.16 FITC-pDNA staining \n\nFor the pDNA staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer I (FITC), 71 ?g of labeling buffer \n\nand 2 ?g of FITC were added at 5 ?g of pDNA and incubated for 4h. Then, 1 volume of NaCl 3 \n\nM and 2.5 volumes of ethanol 100% were added to the solution and incubated at -20\u00baC \n\novernight. The solution was centrifuged during 30 min, at 12 000g and 4\u00baC and washed two \n\ntimes with ethanol 75% (centrifugation during 5 min at 12 000g and 4\u00baC). The pellet with the \n\nFITC-pDNA was used for the nanoparticles preparation. \n\n3.2.17 Transfection \n\nCell live imaging \n\nHeLa cells were cultured up to 80-90% confluence and trypsinized. After the cells were \n\nressuspended in new complete medium, a small volume was seeded in a ?-slide of 8 wells. \n\nAfter 24h, the complete medium was substituted by medium without antibiotic and FBS and \n\nthe nucleus stained with Hoescht 33342 1:1000, for 20 min in the dark. The ?-slide of 8 wells \n\nwas transfer to the confocal microscope, containing a camera to maintain 37\u00baC and 5% of CO2, \n\nand the pDNA-FITC/MgCO3 nanoparticles were injected and imagens of z-stacks were \n\ncaptured (20 min each) during 6h of transfection. \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 33 \n\nChapter IV \u2013 Results and Discussion \n\n \n\n4.1 HPV E6/E7\nMUT\n\n plasmid DNA purification \n\n4.1.1 Epoxy monolith modification \n\nWith the aim of understanding the influence of different functional groups immobilized in \n\nepoxy monoliths used in the present work, a screening was performed to evaluate the \n\nchromatographic behavior of a pre-purified pDNA sample in different epoxy monoliths (non-\n\nmodified, modified with the 2-allyloxyethanol spacer arm, modified with arginine amino acid \n\nand modified with the 2-allyloxyethanol spacer arm and arginine). Thus, two chromatographic \n\nstrategies were performed on each monolith: to analyze their behavior under hydrophobic \n\nconditions, a decreasing linear gradient from 3 to 0 M of (NH4)2SO4 in Tris-EDTA, pH 8, was \n\nimplemented and to analyze their behavior under ionic conditions, an increasing linear \n\ngradient from 0 to 3 M NaCl in Tris-EDTA, pH 8, was conducted. Each linear gradient was \n\nperformed during 15 min.  \n\nAnalyzing the retention time (rt) values summarized in table 4, the non-modified epoxy \n\nmonolith retained the pDNA only under hydrophobic elution conditions, eluting at around 11 \n\nmin. This chromatographic behavior might be justified by the interaction of the exposed \n\nhydrophobic bases of nucleic acids and the hydrophobic epoxy groups, in the presence of high \n\n(NH4)2SO4 concentrations [103]. After, it was evaluated the addition of the 2-allyloxyethanol \n\nspacer arm in the epoxy monolith, that retained the pDNA also only under hydrophobic \n\nconditions, with a rt of 12 min, meaning a slight increase on the ligand hydrophobicity. The \n\nepoxy monolith with immobilized arginine amino acids had an entirely different \n\nchromatographic behavior, since only retained the pDNA under ionic elution conditions, being \n\neluted after 10 min. At last, the arginine monolith with the 2-allyloxyethanol spacer arm had \n\na lower rt (8.6 min and only under ionic conditions) comparing to the arginine monolith.  \n\nTable 4 - Evaluation of the retention time of four epoxy monoliths (non-modified, modified with the \n\n2-allyloxyethanol spacer arm, modified with arginine amino acid and modified with the 2-\n\nallyloxyethanol spacer arm and arginine), under hydrophobic and ionic elution conditions. \n\n Hydrophobic condition  Ionic condition \n\nNon-modified 10.7  \u2014 \n\nWith spacer arm 12  \u2014 \n\nArginine \u2014  10 \n\nArginine with spacer arm \u2014  8.6 \n\n \n\n\n\n 34 \n\nThis might be because of the mild influence of the spacer arm on the pDNA interactions due \n\nto its electronegative feature. A similar behavior was already described in previous studies \n\nwith arginine and agmatine monoliths [75, 104]. The agmatine ligand is a neurotransmitter \n\nderived from the decarboxylation of arginine amino acid. The absence of the negative \n\ncarboxyl group favored multiple non-covalent interactions that result in higher pDNA \n\nretention and the need of higher NaCl concentrations (>1.8 M) for the pDNA elution [104], \n\ncomparing to the arginine ligand (795 mM NaCl) [75]. The arginine monolith with spacer arm \n\nwas later characterized and explored for the sc pDNA purification. \n\n4.1.2 Dynamic binding capacity \n\nThe DBC is an important factor to characterize the chromatographic support. It is already \n\ndescribed that monoliths have higher binding capacity when compared to the conventional \n\nchromatographic supports [73, 75, 105]. These last ones are designed with small size pores \n\nthat cannot handle large molecules, such as pDNA [65]. \n\nFor instance, Eon-Duval and coworkers demonstrated that a DEAE column has a dynamic \n\ncapacity of 3 mg/mL [106] and Ongkudon and coworkers showed that polymethacrylate \n\nconical monolith has a DBC of 21.54 mg/mL [107]. Moreover, some latest results also shown \n\nthat methacrylate monolithic supports exhibit DBC up to 8 mg/mL [108]. Recently, Amorim \n\nand coworkers showed that the capacity of L-histidine monolith (6.24 mg/mL) is 29-fold \n\nhigher than that of the conventional histidine\u2013agarose matrix (0.217 mg/mL) at 50% of \n\nbreakthrough curves [109]. \n\nHence, the arginine monolith with spacer arm was characterized in terms of DBC and was \n\ncompared to the conventional agarose-based matrix and arginine monolith. Breakthrough \n\nexperiments were performed at 1 mL/min, with 0.05 mg/mL of the pre-purified pDNA (figure \n\n14). The column was equilibrated with Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0 and then overloaded with the pDNA \n\nsample. To determine the DBC of the arginine monolith with spacer arm, it was calculated \n\nthe amount of pDNA per mL of support at 10%, 50% and 100% breakthrough curve. After, the \n\npDNA was eluted with 1 M NaCl in Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0 and the monolith was regenerated with \n\n0.5 M NaOH solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 35 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 14 - Breakthrough curve (continuous line) and void volume (dashed line) of arginine monolith \n\nwith spacer arm. pDNA solution (0.05 mg/mL) was loaded at 1 mL/min. \n\nThe DBC at 10% of breakthrough curve was 2.53 mg/mL, which is much higher than the 0.133 \n\nmg/mL of the conventional support of arginine agarose but lower than the 3.55 mg/mL of the \n\narginine monolith [75]. The difference between the DBC of the arginine monolith and the \n\narginine monolith with spacer arm can be due to the lower amount of available ligands in the \n\nlast one or to the electronegativity of the 2-allyloxyethanol spacer arm, which may promote \n\nsome repulsion by the pDNA phosphate groups under ionic conditions. \n\nThe conventional agarose-based matrix does not have channels like the monolithic support, \n\nthus the pDNA molecules only interact with the functional groups that are at the bead surface \n\nwhich represents a lower surface area. \n\nOn the other hand, monoliths have become the chromatographic support of choice for the \n\npurification of sc pDNA, since they are capable of separating large biomolecules, such as \n\npDNA, they enable a fast separation with a reduced retention time, allowing the pDNA \n\nintegrity maintenance. Monoliths have the great advantage of higher binding capacity \n\ncomparing to conventional supports [65, 73, 110]. In fact, the DBC of the arginine monolith \n\nwith spacer arm was 19-fold higher than the DBC of the arginine agarose-based support at 10% \n\nbreakthrough. For this reason, the arginine monolith with spacer arm presented in this work \n\ncan be a promising affinity chromatographic support. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 36 \n\n4.1.3 Separation of HPV E6/E7\nMUT\n\n plasmid DNA isoforms \n\nThe purification strategy explored initially in the present work, for the arginine monolith with \n\nspacer arm, had already been described by our research group for HPV E6/E7 pDNA \n\npurification in the arginine monolith, based on increasing stepwise gradient of NaCl (ionic \n\nelution conditions) [75]. For a first evaluation of the selectivity, several experiments were \n\nperformed to study the elution/retention chromatographic behavior of the arginine monolith \n\nwith spacer arm, towards finding the ideal conditions to separate the pDNA isoforms. All the \n\nexperiments were performed at room temperature. First, the monolith was equilibrated with \n\n584 mM NaCl in Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0, at 1 mL/min. After injection of 200 \u00b5l of the pDNA sample \n\nresulting from alkaline lysis and pre-purification with Qiagen Plasmid Purification Maxi Kit \n\nfrom Qiagen, the unbound species were eluted. Then, the ionic strength was increase to 1 M \n\nNaCl in Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0, to elute the bound species (figure 15 A). The agarose gel \n\nelectrophoresis showed that the linear pDNA started to elute in the first peak, but some \n\namount still elute in the second peak, along with the sc pDNA (figure 15 A, lane 1 and 2, \n\nrespectively). Thus, the concentration of NaCl on the equilibrium step was increased, aiming \n\nthe total elution of the linear pDNA on the first peak. The monolith was equilibrated with 596 \n\nmM NaCl in Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0, and after the elution of unbound species the ionic strength was \n\nincreased to 1 M NaCl in Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0, caused the elution of the bound species (figure 15 \n\nB). As shown at figure 15 B, the sc pDNA started to elute in the first peak with the linear \n\nisoform, which continues to have an amount that elutes in the second peak. A higher NaCl \n\nconcentration (620 mM) was also tested in the equilibrium step but the agarose gel \n\nelectrophoresis presented on figure 15 C reveals that the linear and the sc pDNA were eluted \n\nin both peaks, showing that the desired selectivity was not achieved only by the manipulation \n\nof NaCl concentrations in the equilibrium step. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 37 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 15 \u2013 Chromatographic profile of the pre-purified pDNA sample in the arginine monolith with \n\nspacer arm, at a laboratorial scale, using a stepwise gradient of 584 (A), 596 (B) and 620 (C) mM in \n\nthe equilibration steps and 1 M NaCl in Tris- EDTA, pH 8.0 in the elution steps, 1 mL/min.

Therefore, the pH buffer was change to \n\n7.0. After several experiments by manipulating the NaCl concentration on the equilibrium \n\nstep at pH 7.0, the elution conditions that seem to be the best are described below. The \n\nmonolith was equilibrated with 680 mM NaCl in Tris-EDTA, pH 7.0. After the injection of 200 \n\n\u00b5l of pre-purified pDNA sample onto the column, the unbound species were eluted in the \n\nflow-through. Thereafter, the ionic strength was increase to 1 M NaCl in Tris-EDTA, pH 7.0 \n\nand a second peak was obtained with the bound species, at 1 mL/min (figure 16 A). The \n\nagarose gel electrophoresis confirmed that the linear pDNA elution occurred in the first peak \n\ntogether with a small amount of sc pDNA (figure 16 B, lane 2). The second peak contained the \n\nsc pDNA, totally isolated (figure 16 B, lane 3). In this way, the total recovery of the sc pDNA \n\nmust be sacrificed, in favor of obtaining the desired isoform with the required purity at the \n\nsecond peak. \n\n \n\nFigure 16 \u2013 (A) Chromatographic profile of the pre-purified pDNA sample in the arginine monolith \n\nwith spacer arm, at a laboratorial scale, using a stepwise gradient of 680 mM and 1 M NaCl in Tris- \n\nEDTA, pH 7.0, 1 mL/min.

For the purpose of separating the sc pDNA from a \n\nlysate sample (other pDNA isoforms, RNA, gDNA, proteins and endotoxins), different \n\nstrategies can be explored such as the use of competitive ligand or the manipulation of pH, \n\nionic strength or polarity, depending on the matrix and the characteristics of the biomolecule \n\nA \n\nA 2 1 \n\nlinear \n\nsc \n\nB \n\n\n\n 39 \n\n[57]. Thereby, the results previously described were taken into account to start the \n\nexperiments on the purification of sc pDNA from a lysate sample, at a laboratorial scale. \n\nThe first experiment was based on the ideal elution conditions that allowed the isolation of \n\nthe sc pDNA isoform from the pre-purified pDNA sample. Thus, the monolith was equilibrated \n\nwith 680 mM NaCl in Tris-EDTA, pH 7.0, at 1 mL/min. After injection of 200 \u00b5L of lysate \n\nsample, the unbound species were eluted in the flow-through. To elute the bound species, \n\nthe ionic strength was increased to 1 M NaCl in Tris-EDTA, pH 7.0. The correspondent \n\nchromatogram and agarose gel electrophoresis of each peak are presented on figure 17 A. \n\n \n\nFigure 17 \u2013 (A) Chromatographic profile of the E. coli lysate sample in arginine monolith with spacer \n\narm, at a laboratorial scale, using a stepwise gradient of 680 mM and 1 M NaCl in Tris-EDTA, pH 7.0. \n\nInjection volume: 200 ?L of lysate sample. (B) Agarose gel electrophoresis of the recovered peaks. Lane \n\nA - lysate sample; lane 1 and 2 - peak 1and 2, respectively. \n\nFigure 17 B revealed that only the RNA eluted in the first peak and all of the different \n\nplasmid isoforms eluted in the second one. Although RNA molecules are negatively charged \n\nand single stranded, they have low molecular weight, comparing to pDNA [42]. In addition, \n\nthis result also shows that the presence of other nucleic acids can alter the binding/elution \n\nbehavior of the pDNA isoforms, which were eluted together in the second peak. Thus, more \n\nexperiments were performed, adding an additional step and manipulating the NaCl \n\nconcentration. Considering that the equilibration step with 680 mM NaCl in Tris-EDTA, pH 7.0 \n\nallowed the total elimination of the RNA in the flow-through, this step was maintained. Then, \n\ntwo elution steps were performed by increasing the NaCl concentration to separate the \n\nretained species (710 mM and 1 M NaCl in Tris-EDTA, pH 7.0). The agarose gel electrophoresis \n\nrevealed that both linear and sc pDNA isoforms were eluted in both peaks (figure 18 A). \n\nB A \n\nA 2 1 \n\nRNA \n\nlinear \nsc \n\n\n\n 40 \n\nSince there was no selectivity with previous elution steps, different concentrations of NaCl \n\nwere explored in the first elution step. For instance, it was used a concentration of 800 mM \n\nNaCl in Tris-EDTA, pH 7.0, but, as it is presented on figure 18 B, although the recovery of the \n\nsc pDNA in the last peak is sacrificed, it was not possible to obtain the desired conformation \n\ntotally purified. These results allow to conclude that the strategy by manipulation of NaCl \n\nconcentration in the elution step was unable to selectively separate the sc pDNA from the \n\nother isoforms. \n\n    \n\n \n\nFigure 18 - Chromatographic profile of the E. coli lysate sample in arginine monolith with spacer \n\narm, at a laboratorial scale, using a stepwise gradient of 680 mM in the equilibrium steps, 710 mM \n\n(A), 800 (B) in the first elution steps and 1 mM NaCl in Tris-EDTA, pH 7.0 in the second elution \n\nsteps. Injection volume: 200 ?L of lysate sample. Agarose gel electrophoresis of the recovered peaks. \n\nLane A - lysate sample; lane 1, 2 and 3 - peak 1, 2and 3, respectively. \n\nAs mentioned above, the elution strategy can be through the addition of a competitive agent, \n\nwhere the elution buffer has the same pH, ionic strength and polarity as the equilibrium \n\nA \n\nB \n\nlinear \nsc \n\nRNA \n\nA 2 1 3 \n\n1 3 2 \n\noc \n\nRNA \n\nlinear \nsc \n\n\n\n 41 \n\nbuffer. The competing agent can bind to the retained biomolecule or to the immobilized \n\nligand, thus preventing interactions between the biomolecule and the ligand. This allows a \n\nbiospecific elution, it being more selective [112]. In fact, Pereira and coworkers have already \n\ndemonstrated the successful application of arginine as a competing agent on the purification \n\nof pre-miR-29 [113]. Bearing this in mind, further experiments were carried out, using a \n\ncompetitive elution strategy, always maintaining the equilibration step to eliminate the RNA. \n\nArginine was used as a competing agent on the elution buffer and several concentrations were \n\ntested (10 mM, 5 mM, 2 mM, 1 mM, 0.5 mM and 0.01 mM). All the experiments showed an \n\nidentical chromatographic behavior as the chromatographic profile presented on figure 19 A, \n\nwhere the second step was executed with the equilibrium buffer supplemented with 0.01 mM \n\narginine and the third step was performed with 1 M NaCl in Tris-EDTA, pH 7.0. The \n\ncorrespondent electrophoresis revealed that the majority of the sc pDNA was eluted in the \n\nsecond step, along with the other isoforms (figure 19 B).  \n\n   \n\nFigure 19 - (A) Chromatographic profile of the E. coli lysate sample in arginine monolith with spacer \n\narm, at a laboratorial scale, using a stepwise gradient of 680 mM, 680 mM + 0.01 mM arginine and 1 \n\nM NaCl in Tris-EDTA, pH 7.0. Injection volume: 200 ?L of lysate sample. (B) Agarose gel electrophoresis \n\nof the recovered peaks. Lane A - lysate sample; lane 1, 2 and 3 - peak 1, 2and 3, respectively. \n\nThis competitive elution is based on the interaction between the retained biomolecule (pDNA) \n\nand the competing agent (free arginine). Hence, in the presence of free arginine in the \n\nelution buffer, the target biomolecule is no longer retained, being eluted. The low selectivity \n\nof this strategy might be due to the fact that the arginine positive charge promotes \n\npreferential binding of pDNA  with free arginine present in the elution buffer, through \n\nelectrostatic interactions [114]. \n\nB A \n\nA 3 1 2 \n\noc \n\nRNA \n\nlinear \nsc \n\n\n\n 42 \n\nAs it was previously referred, the pH manipulation can improve the selectivity of arginine \n\nligand and the sc pDNA recovery yield [111]. Therefore, other strategy to explore in the \n\npurification of the sc pDNA from E. coli lysate was the pH variation in the elution buffer (9, 8, \n\n7.5, 7.3 and 6.5). This experiments demonstrated that the higher the pH, the lower the \n\nretention, since there is a weaker ionic interaction (data not shown). Considering that the \n\npKa of arginine is 12, high pH leads to less effectiveness of the arginine positive charges, \n\ncausing a weaker interaction with the pDNA. \n\nThe condition that showed the best outcome was with pH 7.5. Likewise, the equilibration \n\nstep with 680 mM NaCl in Tris-EDTA, pH 7.0, was also maintained on these experiments, since \n\nit allows the RNA elution on the flow-through. Then, the elution buffer was changed to 650 \n\nmM and 1 M of NaCl in Tris-EDTA, pH 7.5, resulting in the elution of two peaks (figure 20 A). \n\nThe analysis of the respective agarose gel electrophoresis proved that this strategy enables \n\nthe selective separation of non-functional plasmid isoforms in the second peak and the \n\nrecovery of sc pDNA almost isolated in the third peak (figure 20 B, lane 2 and 3, respectively).  \n\n \n\nFigure 20 - (A) Chromatographic profile of the E. coli lysate sample in arginine monolith with spacer \n\narm, at a laboratorial scale, using a stepwise gradient of 680 mM in Tris-EDTA, pH 7.0, 649 mM and \n\n1 M NaCl in Tris-EDTA, pH 7.5. Injection volume: 200 ?L of lysate sample. (B) Agarose gel \n\nelectrophoresis of the recovered peaks. Lane A - lysate sample; lane 1, 2 and 3 - peak 1, 2and 3, \n\nrespectively. \n\nThe results described earlier indicate that the differential interactions between nucleic acids \n\nof the lysate sample and the arginine monolith with spacer arm comply with what was \n\npreviously described [75, 111]. The predominant electrostatic interactions, mostly between \n\nthe arginine positive charges and the negative phosphate groups of the nucleic acids, are due \n\nto the fact that the working pH is lower that the pKa of arginine (12) [115]. These \n\nA B \n\nA 3 1 2 \n\noc \n\nRNA \n\nlinear \nsc \n\n\n\n 43 \n\ninteractions can be weakened by competition with the ions of the NaCl buffer, increasing its \n\nconcentration and thus reducing the effective net charge between the ligand and lower \n\naffinity species [116]. This is why RNA was eluted in the flow-through of the equilibration \n\nbuffer, since it has less interaction points when compared to pDNA under these equilibrium \n\nconditions. Moreover, the specific recognition of the sc pDNA isoform in relation to other \n\nisoforms might be because of the additional non-covalent interactions with the arginine \n\nligand, such as cation-? interactions, bifurcate hydrogen bonds and hydrogen-? interactions, \n\nmainly with the more exposed bases of this conformation caused by the supercoiled \n\nphenomena [56, 117]. Consequently, the slight increase of the buffer pH, along with the \n\nadjustment of the ionic strength, allowed the elution of species with lower affinity (oc and \n\nlinear pDNA isoforms) and the isolation of the sc pDNA in the last peak. \n\n4.1.5 Recovery and purity quantification of the recovered peaks \n\nThe sc pDNA purified fractions obtained from the optimized chromatographic elution strategy \n\nwere analyzed in terms of purity and recovery yield, by CIMac\u2122 pDNA analytical column, \n\naccording to the method previously described [77]. First, the analytical column was \n\nequilibrated with 600 mM of NaCl in 200 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). After, 20 ?L of the \n\nsample recovered from the peak of interest was injected onto the column and a linear \n\ngradient from 600 mM to 700 mM of NaCl was applied, during 10 min, eluting the retained \n\npDNA isoforms.  \n\nThe purity degree was determined by the ratio between the sc pDNA peak area and the total \n\npeak area in the analytical chromatogram, it being 93.3%.  This value supports the fact that \n\narginine monolith with spacer arm can highly purify sc pDNA from a lysate sample. The \n\nrecovery yield was calculated through the ration between the recovered sc pDNA \n\nconcentration and the sc pDNA concentration from the lysate sample, it being almost 72%. \n\nThis value can be due to the sc plasmid loss during its recuperation, concentration and \n\ndesalting steps [73, 75]. Though this recovery yield is lower than the 86% obtained with the \n\narginine monolith [75], it is satisfactory, comparing to other chromatographic strategies, like \n\nthe 62% of recovery yield obtained with anion exchange [118] and the triplex affinity \n\nchromatography [119], as well as the 70%  attained from hydrophobic interaction \n\nchromatography [101]. \n\n4.1.6 Preparative chromatography \n\nThe applicability of arginine monolith with spacer arm was also explored in the purification of \n\nsc pDNA isoform at a preparative scale (figure 21 A). The elution conditions were conducted \n\nin order to ensure the purity of the final pDNA sample. The column was loaded with 68 mL of \n\nlysate sample prepared in the same equilibrium buffer (680 mM NaCl in Tris-EDTA, pH 7.0). \n\nThe agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that the RNA was eluted throughout the assay, \n\n\n\n 44 \n\njoined by the oc and linear isoforms elution and lastly the sc plasmid isoform partial elution \n\n(figure 21 B). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 21 - (A) Chromatographic profile of the E. coli lysate sample in arginine monolith with spacer \n\narm, at a preparative scale under overloading conditions, using a stepwise gradient of 670 mM in \n\nTris-EDTA, pH 7.0, 649 mM and 1 M NaCl in Tris-EDTA, pH 7.5. (B) Respective agarose gel \n\nelectrophoresis. Lane 1-8 - peak 1; lane 9 - peak 2, respectively. \n\nThis behavior is similar to the one observed in the laboratorial scale assay, suggesting that \n\nthe preferential retention of sc pDNA also occurred in overloaded conditions. After the \n\ncolumn loading, two steps were performed (with 649 mM and 1 M NaCl in Tris-EDTA, pH 7.5) \n\nto elute the bound species. Figure 21 shows the recovery of sc pDNA in the first elution step, \n\nalmost free of other plasmid isoforms. In this approach, 0.83 mg of pDNA/mL of column were \n\nrecovered, with a purity higher than the result obtained in the laboratorial approach (98.5% \n\nand 93.3%, respectively). These results indicate that the elution strategy applied on the \n\npreparative approach is more suitable to obtain the required purity of sc pDNA, although it is \n\n8 9 1 5 6 7 2 3 4 \n\nA \n\nB \n\nmAU \n\n\n\n 45 \n\nnot possible to load higher amount of lysate sample without compromising the sc pDNA \n\nrecovery. \n\n4.1.7 Host impurities assessment in the purified sc pDNA \n\nTo apply the sc HPV-16 E6/E7\nMUT\n\n pDNA vaccine pharmaceutically, it must be obtained from a \n\ncomplex E. coli lysate sample and the impurities elimination must be assured, following the \n\nregulatory agency specifications: sample homogeneity higher than 97% supercoiled, proteins \n\nand RNA undetectable by micro-BCA method and 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis, \n\nrespectively, gDNA under 2 ?g/mg plasmid by PCR and endotoxins under 0.1 EU/ng plasmid by \n\nLAL assay (table 5) [60, 120]. \n\nTable 5 - Regulatory agency specifications (adapted from [60, 120]). \n\nImpurities and homogeneity  Criteria \n\nHomogeneity  >97% sc \n\nProteins  Undetectable \n\nRNA  Undetectable \n\ngDNA &lt;2 ?g/mg \n\nEndotoxins &lt;0.1 EU/?g pDNA \n\n \n\nTo reduce pathogenic effects and adverse reactions, the pDNA for therapeutic application \n\nshould be free from contaminants and host impurities [121]. Regarding the content of \n\nprotein, is must be undetectable, since they can cause immune responses, like anaphylactic \n\nshock or autoimmune diseases, or induce biological reactions due to the production of \n\ncytokines, hormones and/or antibodies [122, 123]. Hence, the regulatory agencies define that \n\nproteins should be undetectable in the sc pDNA sample (table 5). The protein content was \n\nassessed by the micro-BCA assay, already described on chapter 3.2.7. The results shown in \n\ntable 6 present that the protein content of the lysate sample and the pDNA sample was \n\nundetectable, either at the laboratorial or preparative scale, being in agreement with the \n\nrequirements of the regulatory agencies. These results suggest that the clarification step with \n\n2.5 M of ammonium sulfate in the end of the lysis procedure was effective in the removal of \n\nproteins.    \n\nAnother parameter that must be measured is the gDNA, because some of its fragments can \n\nencode an oncogene that can integrate the cell genome after transfection, possibly causing \n\ntumor formation [122]. The quantification of gDNA was obtained with real-time PCR. As \n\npresented in table 6, the gDNA amount at the laboratorial scale was initially 9.980 ng/?g of \n\npDNA and considerably reduced to 0.090 ng/?g of pDNA. At the preparative scale, the initial \n\ngDNA amount was 7.320 ng/?g of pDNA and reduced to 0.680 ng/?g of pDNA. Both values are \n\nbelow the limit imposed by the regulatory agencies (2 ?g/mg of pDNA).  \n\n\n\n 46 \n\nEndotoxins are highly negatively charged lipopolysaccharides (LPS) that constitutes the cell \n\nwall of gram negative bacteria, such as E. coli [122]. They can cause strong biological effects, \n\nincluding activation of the immune system, stimulation of cytokines overproduction, fever, \n\ninduction of endotoxin shock, tissue injury and ultimately death [122, 124, 125]. Endotoxins \n\nassessment was performed by the LAL endotoxin assay kit. Endotoxins were reduced from the \n\ninitial value of 0.434 EU/?g of pDNA in the lysate sample to 0.011 EU/?g of pDNA, at the \n\nlaboratorial scale. Regarding the preparative scale, endotoxins were also significantly \n\nreduced from 5.402 EU/?g of pDNA to 0.003 EU/?g of pDNA. Both values are in agreement \n\nwith the limits of the regulatory agencies. \n\nTable 6- Protein, gDNA and endotoxins measurement in the sc pDNA recovered fraction from the \n\nlaboratorial and preparative chromatography approaches. \n\n \n\nSample Proteins (mg/mL) \n\ngDNA  Endotoxins \n\n (?g/mL) \n(ng/?g \n\npDNA) \n (EU/mL) \n\n(EU/?g \n\npDNA) \n\nLaboratorial \n\nchromatography \n\nLysate sample Undetectable 0.649 9.980  28.198 0.434 \n\npDNA Undetectable 0.004 0.090  0.539 0.011 \n\nPreparative \n\nchromatography \n\nLysate sample Undetectable 0.038 7.320  28.141 5.402 \n\npDNA Undetectable 0.054 0.680  0.264 0.003 \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2 Nanotechnology \n\n4.2.1 MgCO3 Nanoparticles synthesis \n\nThe nanoparticles were synthesized by the co-precipitation method, where the solution A \n\nwith MgCl2 and pDNA is added to the solution B with CaCO3, gelatin and the functionalization \n\ncompound (mannose or galactose). This creates a precipitate \u2013 the nanoparticles - that can be \n\neasily recovered by centrifugation. \n\nMg??2(??)+ ??2??3 (??)? Mg??3 (?)+2???? (??) (3) \n\nThe choice of these materials for the nanoparticles formation is based on the already well \n\ndescribed and effective nanoparticles CaCO3 synthesis protocol [95], but the Ca\n2+\n\n ion was \n\nsubstituted by the Mg\n2+\n\n ion, to investigate if the results of transfection and gene delivery can \n\nbe improved. The use of inorganic nanoparticles, such as carbonates of Ca\n2+\n\n and Mg\n2+\n\n, might \n\neliminate some limitations of the current non-viral genetic vaccine systems, like the \n\ninefficiency of activation of the APCs [126]. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the \n\nincorporation of Mg\n2+\n\n into the nanoparticles caused inhibition of particle growth, leading to a \n\nremarkably improvement on the DNA cellular uptake [127]. \n\n\n\n 47 \n\nOn the other hand, gelatin is a biocompatible and biodegradable polymer, non-toxic and with \n\nlow immunogenicity. Its use on the nanoparticles synthesis improves their properties: it \n\nreduces the nanoparticles size, enhances their stability and ? potential, thus improving the \n\ngene delivery efficiency [98]. \n\nThe mechanisms of both humoral and cellular immune responses have already been \n\nexplained. DNA vaccination aims to activate these two responses, by activating the cytotoxic \n\nT lymphocytes (CD8+) as well as the T helper cells (CD4+). These cells recognize the MHC-(I \n\nand II, respectively)-peptide complex that is presented on APC surface [35].  The major APC is \n\nthe dendritic cell (DC). Therefore, with the purpose of delivering the HPV-16 E6/E7\nMUT\n\n pDNA \n\nvaccine, targeting the DCs seemed to be a promising strategy to enhance the activating of \n\nhumoral and cellular immune responses. \n\nDCs express on their surface c-type lectin receptors (CLRs) that recognize glycosylated self-\n\nantigens or foreign pathogens [128, 129]. This is particularly relevant and useful considering \n\nthat an approach of DC-targeting vaccine delivery is desired. Thus, the nanoparticles surface \n\nwas functionalized with mannose or galactose (carbohydrates that are recognize by CLRs) \n\n[128, 130]. This selective delivery of the nanoparticles can facilitate binding and endocytosis \n\nby the DC. \n\n4.2.2 Cytotoxicity assay \n\nThe MTT assay was performed to assess the MgCO3 nanoparticles effect on cell viability. The \n\nresults revealed a cell viability of 85% \u00b1 0.9 at 24h and 84% \u00b1 1.0 at 48h. This means that \n\nthese nanoparticles do not have an acute cytotoxic effect. \n\nThe components that were later added to the nanoparticles formulation \u2013 gelatin, mannose \n\nand galactose \u2013 are not expected to be cytotoxic, since they were already used on some \n\ntransfection studies [131, 132]. \n\n4.2.3 Encapsulation efficiency \n\nFor therapeutic purposes, the formulation of a suitable pDNA delivery system must \n\nincorporate a large amount of genetic material. To evaluate the EE parameter, different \n\nquantities of pDNA (5 ?g, 7.5 ?g, 10 ?g, 15 ?g and 20 ?g) were tested for the different \n\nsystems and are presented in table 7. Either nanoparticles functionalized with mannose or \n\ngalactose showed a decay of %EE by increasing the pDNA quantity. This may be due to the \n\nlarge size of the plasmid. Moreover, there was a slight decrease on the %EE of the \n\nfunctionalized nanoparticles when comparing to the non-functionalized ones. Other \n\nnanoparticles formulations allowed the same or less %EE. For example, CaCO3 nanoparticles \n\nonly allowed 51-63% EE [95], chitosan\u2013TPP nanoparticles allowed only up to 80% [133] and \n\npoly(lactic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol) nanoparticles allowed up to 90% EE [134]. Therefore, \n\nthe entire %EE was relatively high. \n\n\n\n 48 \n\nTable 7 \u2013 Average %EE of the different pDNA based nanoparticles.

These results are \n\npresented in table 8. \n\nTable 8 - Average %EE of galactose of the pDNA based nanoparticles.

All images on the left were obtained by SEM and all images on the right were obtained by \n\nTEM. \n\n By analysis of figure 22, the nanoparticles for all the different formulations present a round \n\nor oval shape. This is relevant, considering that this morphology allows a quick absorption by \n\nthe cells membrane, facilitating the nano-carrier internalization. \n\nN M \n\nL K \n\nJ I \n\n\n\n 51 \n\nTwo concentrations of gelatin (5 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL) were studied to test the ability of \n\nthis polymer to reduce the nanoparticles size, but the higher concentration led to the \n\nformation of crystals. Thus, 5 mg/mL of gelatin was chosen to formulate the functionalized \n\nnanoparticles. \n\nA more detailed analysis of the obtained images revealed that the use of gelatin decreased \n\nthe size of the nanoparticles, it being in agreement with what was expected  [98]. Besides, \n\nthe functionalization with either mannose or galactose led to the synthesis of nanoparticles \n\nwith similar sizes. \n\n4.2.6 Nanoparticles size \n\nThe morphology influences internalization of the nanoparticles, as well as their size. The \n\nmean size of each nanoparticle system studied was determined using the Zetasizer Nano ZS \n\nand the obtained values are presented in table 9. \n\nTable 9 - Average size of the different pDNA based nanoparticles.

This might be due to the ability of \n\nsmaller particles to be taken up more readily by APCs. Considering that the studied nano-\n\ncarriers have sizes between 99.7 nm and 237.4 nm, they have the ideal size. These values are \n\nin agreement with the relative sizes from the images obtained with SEM and TEM and are \n\nlower than the sizes of CaCO3 nanoparticles (300-500 nm) [95] and similar or lower than the \n\nsizes obtained with other formulations [133, 135]. \n\nMoreover, it is important to notice that the addition of gelatin causes a reduction on the \n\nnanoparticle size, which allows a better absorption and cellular internalization. Besides, the \n\nfunctionalization with mannose or galactose does not lead to the formation of larger \n\n\n\n 52 \n\nnanoparticles. In summary, all the studied systems present sizes in the nano scale, making \n\nthem suitable for cellular uptake and thus appropriate for applications within the DNA \n\nvaccination. \n\n4.2.7 Zeta (? ) potential \n\nThe ? potential of each system was measure, as well as the ? potential of the pDNA and each \n\ncompound (table 10). \n\nTable 10 - Average zeta potential of the different pDNA based nanoparticles. Values were calculated \n\nwith the data obtained from three independent measurements (mean \u00b1 SD, n = 3). \n\nSystem (MgCO3) Zeta Potential (mV)            \n\npDNA -174.2 \u00b1 9.1 \n\nGelatin                                 +78.2 \u00b1 5.2 \n\nMannose +18.4 \u00b1 0.8 \n\nGalactose +37.1 \u00b1 1.3 \n\npDNA/5 mg/mL Gelatin  +65.9 \u00b1 1.5 \n\npDNA/ 10 mg/mL Gelatin  +81.4 \u00b1 3.1 \n\npDNA/5 mg/mL Mannose +32.1 \u00b1 0.8 \n\npDNA/ 5 mg/mL Galactose +50 \u00b1 1.7 \n\npDNA/5 mg/mL Gelatin/Mannose  +71.5 \u00b1 6.1 \n\npDNA/5 mg/mL Gelatin/Galactose +88.9 \u00b1 4.4 \n\npDNA/10 mg/mL Gelatin/Mannose  +82.2 \u00b1 5.1 \n\npDNA/10 mg/mL Gelatin/Galactose  +90.3 \u00b1 6.2 \n\n \n\nAll systems presented positive ? potential. Besides, it is worth to mention that the presence \n\nof gelatin increases the positive charge of the nanoparticles, as it was expected. The positive \n\n? potential facilitates the future interaction of the nanoparticles with the negatively charged \n\ncellular membrane, favoring cell internalization and uptake, therefore enabling a more \n\neffective gene transfection. \n\n4.2.8 Transfection studies \n\nTransfection is the process of uptake of nucleic acids, like pDNA, by eukaryotic cells. Thus, \n\nthe ultimate aim of transfection is to reach the nucleus, where the expression of the \n\ntherapeutic gene occurs. Besides protection of the pDNA, the goal of the nanoparticles is to \n\nmediate and facilitate the cellular uptake. \n\nTo evaluate the transfection process, cell live imaging has been performed and applied in \n\nfluorescence confocal microscopy. This technique allows for the continuous monitoring of the \n\nprocess for which it was chosen. Cell live imaging was performed through a co-localization \n\n\n\n 53 \n\nstudy where the nucleus were stained with Hoechst (blue) and the pDNA within the \n\nnanoparticles was previously stained with FITC (green) (figure 23). \n\n      \n \n\n  \n \n\nFigure 23 \u2013 Transfection ability for the different studied systems. (A) pDNA/Gelatin/MgCO3 \n\nnanoparticles transfection. (B) pDNA/Gelatin/Galactose/MgCO3 nanoparticles transfection. (C) \n\npDNA/Gelatin/Mannose/MgCO3 nanoparticles transfection. \n\nUnfortunately, the captured images had some background noise, but still it is possible to \n\nobserve that the nanoparticles were able to enter the cell and even the nucleus and caused a \n\nlight blue stain. Although more experiments are required, the images on figure 23 are strong \n\nevidence that the nanoparticles were indeed internalized. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA \n\nC \n\nB \n\n\n\n 54 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 55 \n\nChapter V - Conclusions and future perspectives \n\n \n\nDespite the constant and tireless evolution in biotechnology, there are pathologies that \n\nremain unaddressed due to the lack of successful treatments, such as HPV infection. DNA \n\nvaccination arises as a possible answer to this problem, urging the need to develop efficient \n\npurification methods. The use of monolithic chromatography combined with amino acid \n\nligands allows faster separations and increases the selectivity, emerging as a potential way \n\nfor the sc pDNA purification. After the purification step, it is also crucial to develop systems \n\nthat can protect and direct the delivery to the target cells, in order to maximize the \n\ntransfection efficiency and the gene expression of the pDNA molecules. \n\nHence, the purpose of the present work was to explore different elution strategies and \n\noptimize the purification of the sc HPV-16 E6/E7\nMUT\n\n pDNA, using the arginine monolith with \n\nspacer arm, in order to fulfil the criteria of the regulatory agencies for therapeutic \n\napplications. This work also aimed the formulation and characterization of MgCO3 \n\nnanoparticles for in vitro transfection. \n\nInitially, a screening of elution gradients were performed to confirm the presence and \n\ninfluence of different functional groups immobilized in epoxy monoliths, namely the \n\nelectronegative spacer arm and the arginine amino acid ligand, in the pDNA retention. \n\nThereafter, for a complete characterization of the arginine monolith with spacer arm, the \n\ndynamic binding capacity was determined, and the value at 10% of breakthrough curve was \n\n2.53 mg/mL, which is lower than the 3.55 mg/mL of the arginine monolith, probably due to \n\nthe presence of the electronegative spacer arm that promote repulsion by the pDNA. After \n\nthe preliminary studies of the retention/elution of the different isoforms from a pre-purified \n\nsample, different strategies (manipulation of NaCl concentration and/or pH and addition of a \n\ncompeting agent) were explored to obtain the sc pDNA purified from a clarified E. coli lysate. \n\nAfter optimizing the conditions, the best strategy was to combine the manipulation of NaCl \n\nconcentration with the manipulation of pH in the elution buffer (applying a stepwise gradient \n\nof 680 mM NaCl in Tris-EDTA, pH 7, 649 mM and 1 M NaCl in Tris-EDTA, pH 7.5), resulting in a \n\nsc pDNA purification degree of 93.3% and a recovery yield of 72%. The applicability of this \n\nmonolith was also evaluated in the purification of the sc pDNA at a preparative scale, with \n\nthe overloading of the column with a lysate sample. This approach allowed the recovery of \n\n0.83 mg of pDNA/mL of column, with 98.5% of sc pDNA purity (higher than the result obtained \n\nat the laboratorial scale). Additionally, all the impurities (RNA, gDNA, proteins and \n\nendotoxins) were significantly reduced at acceptable levels by the regulatory agencies, either \n\nat laboratorial and preparative scale. \n\n\n\n 56 \n\nMoreover, a suitable nano-carrier was developed and tested in vitro. After adjusting the \n\nconcentrations of the components, the MgCO3 nanoparticles were functionalized for further \n\ntargeted delivery. After, the nanoparticles were characterized in terms of encapsulation \n\nefficiency (between 60% and 90%), morphology (round shape), size (99.7-237.4 nm) and zeta \n\npotential (positive). All these data suggested that the developed nanoparticles were suitable \n\nfor cellular uptake and thus appropriate for therapeutic applications. Therefore, the in vitro \n\nstudies accompanied with confocal microscopy proved transfection occurrence showing cell \n\ninternalization, as well as, nucleus targeting of nanoparticles. \n\nIn conclusion, it was confirmed that the arginine monolith with spacer arm allowed the sc \n\npDNA purification with a good purity and recovery yield and the MgCO3 nanoparticles proved \n\nto be an efficient delivery system, it being a promising strategy for the development of an \n\neffective DNA vaccine against HPV infections. \n\nHowever, the transfection studies must be optimized and immunocytochemistry must be \n\napplied in order to evaluate the transfection efficiency of all three developed delivery \n\nsystems through the analysis of fluorescence intensity differences of the FITC-pDNA. \n\nConsidering that the DCs are excellent APCs and they have a key role on the activation of the \n\ncytotoxic T lymphocytes and the T helper cells, it is important to evaluate the transfection \n\nefficiency in these cells. If the functionalization of the nanoparticles by the ligands mannose \n\nand galactose enhances the transfection in DCs, then it can be predictable that the in vitro \n\nsystems can perform a targeted delivery to in vivo DCs. After selecting the more promising \n\ndelivery system, in vitro transfection studies in DCs should be conducted to evaluate the \n\nexpression of the E6 and E7 antigenic proteins by immunohistochemistry or western blot. \n\nMoreover, in vivo studies with mice should be performed to administer the DNA vaccine, using \n\nthe pDNA encapsulated in the nano-carrier that revealed to be more promising. In addition, to \n\nevaluate the activation of immune responses, the quantification of cytotoxic T lymphocytes \n\nand T helper cells should be accomplished by flux cytometry. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 57 \n\nReferences \n\n1.
