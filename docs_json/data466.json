This makes it necessary to use equipment to carry out the first processing of the mixture in a controlled manner. The objective is to separate the oil, gas and water so as to ensure compliance with the standards in force for subsequent transfer to terminals or refineries, or conditioned for reuse in the primary processing plant itself or for disposal.\nIn primary processing, the first stage of separation is located downstream of the production manifold and involves three-phase separation. The principal mechanisms of the separation involved are separation by gravity, decanting the denser fluid, inertial separation, where drastic changes in velocity and direction enable the gas to separate from the liquid phase due to its lower inertia, the coalescence of drops of oil, where the promotion of contact between drops encourages its aggregation and separation and the centrifugal force, which also makes use of the difference in density between liquid and gas to separate the phases more efficiently than gravitational separation, due to the higher intensity of the centrifugal field over the gravitational field. At the end of the process the oil is stable and dehydrated; the gas contains only the lightest fractions and is free of water and acid gases, and the water is appropriate for reinjection into the well or disposal without causing environmental damage.\nPetrobras is permanently investing in innovative, more efficient and safer projects. One of them is the System of Subsea Separation of Oil and Water (SSAO) installed in the\nMarlin Field on the Campos Basin, Rio de Janeiro (RJ). This is the first three-phase system of its type installed in deep water in the world, and is prominent for separating fluids on the seabed injecting the produced water back into the well. This means that there is a respite in the processing plant on the host platform, economizing space on the platform and allowing an increase in the oil processing capacity of the unit.\nThe project received the help of ESSS - Engineering Simulation and Scientific Software - to carry out multiphase simulations connected to heat transfer for an evaluation of the separation efficiency in each piece of equipment. The project was focused on simulations of the SSAO equipment from its conception stage, operating together with experimental testing so as to help in the alterations of the design, investigate and detect possible problems in its secondary systems during normal operations and in transient operating conditions, such as stopping and starting. In addition to this, the numerical simulations allow the evaluation of alternative operational arrangements, such as the injection of hydrate inhibitors and the insulation of lines.\nThe specialist in separation of phases and cyclonic technologies, Carlos Alberto Capela Moraes is interviewed addressing some of the principal challenges in the primary processing stage of oil, especially the subsea separation of water and oil carried out on oil platforms. Capela graduated in Civil Engineering from the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), and Mastered in Chemical Engineering and obtained his Doctorate in Mechanical Engineering from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). He joined Petrobras in 1978, working in different sectors of basic engineering projects (EB) and research and development (R&amp;D), in the area of Primary Oil Processing (E&amp;P), including the coordination of projects in this area.\n\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0\nSince you joined Petrobras, you have worked in the area of primary processing of oil. Could you describe briefly what the concept of primary processing of oil is and what is its purpose?\nCarlos Alberto Capela Moraes - Primary processing of oil includes activities of handling effluents from the well (fluids and possibly solids) aiming at specifying them to meet the requirements of the downstream phases and/or utilization in the primary processing plant itself. The Primary Processing Plant for Oil (PPP) aims at obtaining: stable and dehydrated oil, dehydrated gas free from acidic gases and heavy fractions, produced water conditioned for disposal and/or reinjection and solids conditioned for disposal.\nYou acted in the basic and executive project for the Subsea Separator of Oil and Water (SSAO) pilot on Marlin, from the conception phase of the system to the program for technological qualification. Is this subsea processing the tendency for the future of primary processing?\nCarlos Alberto Capela Moraes - Subsea processing should not substitute conventional topside processing in the future, even in the medium term. However, it is an important alternative for mature and marginal fields. Subsea separation of oil and water, with the reinjection of produced water could be highly convenient when the water processing capacity in the deck installations reaches saturation. Subsea separation of gas-liquid and oil-water (with reinjection of the latter) can ensure production in marginal fields, which do not justify the installation of an autonomous production platform.\nWhat are the advantages of employing subsea processing that you consider to be most significant and that justify this technique in the oil and gas industry?\nCarlos Alberto Capela Moraes - The increase in production, when possible, through a reduction of counter pressure at the wellhead (which translates into an increase in revenues for the operator) and a reduction of costs in managing the produced water are the two most important aspects.\nDespite the evident advantages in placing the PPP plants on the seabed instead of having larger marine structures, the generalization of this configuration in the operators' offshore projects has been occurring slowly. What are the reasons for this?\nCarlos Alberto Capela Moraes - We are dealing with technologies still in the stage of development, which are highly complex, given the environmental conditions (high pressures, low temperatures, difficult direct access, etc.). The examples we have today do not avoid the installation of support in conventional production units (host platforms). Due to the pioneering aspects of subsea processing, the operators have many uncertainties relative to the reliability of the solutions employed and the costs of maintenance and intervention in the case of failures.\nIn relation to the environmental impact, could the separation and reinjection of water without sending it topside be considered an advantage relative to present processing?\nCarlos Alberto Capela Moraes - The reinjection of water into the reservoir could be considered the solution having the least environmental impact, given that it returns the fluid with no commercial value to its point of origin. To dispose of it in conventional treatment, there will always be some impact through dispersion in the receiving body of water (the ocean) with different salinity and residues of oil.\nHow do you see the higher costs of maintenance and intervention in the event of failure or leaks in the subsea separator?\nCarlos Alberto Capela Moraes - The costs of maintenance of the subsea processing systems are still an unknown quantity to the operators, due to the low number of such systems in operation in the world and the lack of reliable data and the average time between system, subsystem or component failures in subsea processing. Without doubt, we are talking about very important information, whose estimate with an adequate degree of certainty is a requirement for the dissemination of the technology. Relative to leaks, the present experience of Petrobras with the first subsea separation system is that the operating pressure (within the system) is lower than the environmental hydrostatic pressure (surface of the sea), and therefore\nthe risk of hydrocarbons leaking from the system to the sea is practically zero.\nWhat is the present degree of maturity of oil-water subsea separation systems and reinjection of the produced water?\nCarlos Alberto Capela Moraes - Despite the existence of three systems operating in the world (including that of Petrobras), we are dealing with a pioneering technology, principally when referring to the treatment and conditioning of water for reinjection - which is not done by the first two, only by the Petrobras system - and therefore, we are dealing with a technology still under development. The Petrobras SSAO project is denominated \"Pilot Project\u201d, exactly for this reason.\nWhat are the principal challenges and technological bottlenecks in subsea processing?\nCarlos Alberto Capela Moraes - I understand that the principal challenges and technological bottlenecks are: reliability in subsea equipment, operational costs (removal and maintenance of equipment) and the necessity for change in operational culture in the systems, starting with the approach for repairing and correcting possible problems topside to an approach that prevents the problems in the first place.\nThroughout your years working in Petrobras, what are the importance and benefits gained through computer simulations in the primary processing of oil?\nCarlos Alberto Capela Moraes - The primary processing of oil deals with multiphase outflows in systems with non-conventional geometries, such as the case of those internal for the gas-oil-water separators. Due to the complexity of this type of system, the experimental analysis is complex, has high cost and, frequently, it is difficult to obtain localized information of the flow. The employment of CFD, in the investigation into the system's behavior is a much more viable approach, and apart from the models available for multiphase systems still being limited, their development has been improving on a daily basis, and presently, it is already possible to obtain results that can be complemented by reduced experimental studies having\nless complexity. We are therefore dealing with a tool that is very useful for the project.\nYou coordinated the Technical Qualification Program team for the SSAO. How was the CFD tool adopted in the stages of the project and qualification of the oil-water separation system?\nCarlos Alberto Capela Moraes - The TQP (Technological Qualification Program) of the SSAO was an eminently experimental program, in full scale, for the components of SSAO. However, the CFD was employed to focus some of the experiments, to investigate possible causes of problems found in the experiments and even to provide alterations to the design of components that presented problems in the experimental investigation. In addition, transient operational conditions, as for example the formation of recirculation zones in \"dead legs\u201d, together with bypasses in the system, were investigated using this tool, enabling determination of operational arrangements (injection of hydrate inhibitors into these \"dead legs\u201d).\n\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0\nComputer simulations bring benefits to offshore projects\nCenpes (Petrobras) Equipment Engineer, Daniel Carvalho, speaks about the importance of the use of CFD simulations in the development of oceanic engineering projects.\nSimula\u00e7\u00e3o computacional traz benef\u00edcios a projetos offshore\nEngenheiro de equipamentos do CENPES (Petrobras), Daniel Carvalho, fala sobre a import\u00e2ncia do uso de simula\u00e7\u00f5es de CFD no\nJ\ndesenvolvimento de projetos de engenharia oce\u00e2nica.\nLa simulaci\u00f3n computacional trae beneficios a proyectos offshore\nIngeniero de equipos de CENPES (Petrobras), Daniel Carvalho, habla sobre la importancia del uso de simulaciones de CFD en el desarrollo de proyectos de ingenier\u00eda oce\u00e2nica.\nThe development of new projects in the area of oceanic engineering requires testing that guarantees quality and safety in equipment, such as oil platforms and a variety of\nboats. The analysis of these structures by the responsible engineers requires the capacity to evaluate their behavior when subject to the environmental conditions. One of the principal challenges of the area is to carry out testing that simulates the real situations to which these structures are exposed, given that operations in the offshore segment are frequently carried out in severe environments.\nThe extraction of oil from the pre-salt brings great challenges. The fact that companies such as Petrobras exploit reserves in fields that are located up to 400km off the Brazilian coast and in regions deep in the sea bed (reaching depths of greater than 7km, and below the layers of salt) exposes the offshore structures to severe meteorological and oceanic conditions. In addition, the pre-salt reservoirs present higher levels of contaminants (carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid, among others) and high pressures and fluid temperatures.\nThe evaluation of the interaction between these structures and the environmental conditions can be carried out in two different ways. The first requires a test laboratory, where the tests are carried out with a miniature of the structure. The second consists of the utilization of computer simulation software, which often allows a full-scale analysis of the structure, guaranteeing that different experiments are carried out, all within reach of only a click of the mouse. The utilization of simulations in conjunction with experimentation permits a fuller evaluation, while using less time and lower costs.\nThe Equipment Engineer from the department of Oceanic Engineering Technology (TEO) in the Petrobras Research Center (Cenpes), Daniel Fonseca de Carvalho e Silva, approaches some of the challenges in carrying out offshore structure testing in an interview, and explains how the simulation systems are important in the development and improvement of projects in this area.\nIn Cenpes, Daniel conducts Research and Development (R&amp;D) projects and provides technical assistance to the operational departments of the company, carrying out Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyses and conducting experiments for offshore systems. He graduated in Mechanical Engineering from the Federal University of\nRio de Janeiro (UFRJ) and obtained his Masters in the same university in 2005, by undertaking research into the area of numeric simulation of external outflows utilizing the Discrete Vortex Method.\n\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0\nHow do you see the utilization of computer simulation systems in the area of oceanic engineering?\nDaniel Carvalho - The computer simulation systems are engineering tools that help in the execution of projects and give support in the taking of decisions, just like experimental infrastructure. When we speak of oceanic engineering, the traditional approach is to utilize only reduced-scale test models in a laboratory. Before simulations, the only way of doing engineering analyses were these tests or analytic formulations with limited bands of application. These days we have the capacity for a substantially expanded analysis utilizing computer simulations together with the experiments.\nWhat are the principal benefits gained by computer simulations?\nDaniel Carvalho - Simulation helps in the reduction of costs and time taken in making decisions and technical evaluations. In many situations, simulations allow a full-scale evaluation, given that in the area of oceanic engineering, it is practically unviable to test on a scale close to full size, given the large dimensions common in the structures. Another great benefit is to enable the measurement of variables in any part of the simulated system, without necessarily requiring the test planning or assembly of the measuring instruments, which itself could influence the results of the analysis. For these reasons, the numerical analysis has a greater degree of flexibility, allowing new measurements or even the simulation of a new condition not foreseen initially.\nFor which situations in the area of oceanic engineering would you recommend laboratory experiments?\nDaniel Carvalho - While the experimental technique has limitations, the results of the experiments are regulated naturally by the laws of physics, therefore their\nextrapolation to full scale and the interpretation of the results are debatable, although the physical experiment is not. Accordingly, it is fundamental to return to experimentation in highly innovative cases or those on the frontier of validity for numerical models. It is very common for example to establish variation and optimization of a project through simulation and confirmation of the final configuration by experimentation.\nFor which situations in the area of oceanic engineering would you recommend the use of computer simulation?\nDaniel Carvalho - The numerical models are mathematical formulations aiming to represent nature. When these models are frequently confronted with experiments and/or field data, it is possible to establish conditions in which the simulations may be considered validated. In this case, it is possible to prove technical evaluations confidently based on the results of simulations. In addition, there are situations where it is not possible to carry out experimentation on the appropriate scale or within the required timescale, making simulation necessary.\nWhat advice would you give to professionals who work in project development in the area of oceanic engineering?\nDaniel Carvalho - Whether in the offshore area or even in other areas of engineering, it is ideal to use both tools; simulation and experimentation. More important than the approach selected to carry out a technical evaluation is to have full knowledge of the approximations involved and, consequently, the limitations in the model assembled to represent reality.\nWere you expecting to receive the OMAE Award last year?\nDaniel Carvalho - Some of the Judges had indicated the possibility that my work would run for the award; however, other people had also done good work. The work arose from the systematic evaluation of simulation models, demonstrating that the simulators employed in Cenpes are already capable of allowing virtual experimentation of the effects of winds and currents on marine structures with the precision required for our applications.\nCould the work you undertook, which won the OMAE 2013 Award be considered a differential for oceanic engineering?\nDaniel Carvalho - In some more traditional sectors, Computational Fluid Dynamics is still seen with a certain reticence. I have seen this change. The work that I undertook together with the Cenpes team and those from the IPT (Instituto de Pesquisas Tecnol\u00f3gicas) laboratories proves the capacity of this type of simulation in reproducing the laboratory tests virtually. I believe that this is a great contribution to this process of change.\nAre you working on a new project in Cenpes?\nDaniel Carvalho - We are taking another step forward. Now we are investigating the surge of waves, through a research project aiming at analyzing green water loading in offshore structures. This phenomenon is highly complex and requires the development and validation of new numerical models. I have worked with different institutions that contribute to the project and we utilize simulation tools intensely.\n\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0\nCombustion: energy for development\nMore than 80% of the world\u2019s energy is still thermal through the burning of fossil fuels.\nCombust\u00e3o: energia para desenvolver\nMais de 80% da energia mundial ainda \u00e9 de origem t\u00e9rmica pela queima de combust\u00edveis f\u00f3sseis.\nCombustion: energ\u00eda para desarrollar\nM\u00e1s del 80% de la energ\u00eda mundial todav\u00eda es de origen t\u00e9rmico por la quema de combustibles f\u00f3siles.\nCombustion is one of the most important chemical processes in the history of humanity. The control of fire was probably the first moment in which man really began to control his own environment. Its importance has not diminished with time and even today, it is the burning of fossil fuels that produces most of the energy that enables us to live life as we know it: around 85% of the world's energy production is provided from combustion processes of oil products, natural gas, coal or biomass.\nIn simple terms, combustion is characterized as the combination of an oxidizing agent, usually oxygen, and a combustible material, capable of combining chemically with the oxygen, liberating heat and emitting light. In addition, the process of combustion forms several compounds, which are not always welcome, as the result of the combination of the reagents' atoms: pollutants such as CO2, CO, NOx,\nSOx and soot are among the greatest problems at present, being directly responsible for global scale phenomena, such as the Greenhouse Effect and acid rain, which provokes extensive damage to the earth's biogeochemical cycles. These pollutants are also detrimental to human health.\nConsidering the importance of the energy generated, there are several efforts and initiatives to minimize the impacts on the environment. Further, there have been investments in the development of clean energy sources (renewable in the short term) and at the same time, in technical innovation, which, when incorporated into the equipment used in the burning, reduce considerably the impact on the environment.\nThe relevance of combustion these days and what the tendencies will be in future energy production are the topics addressed in the following interview with combustion specialist Dr. Lu\u00eds Fernando Figueira da Silva. Dr. Luis Fernando is graduated in Aeronautic Engineering with a Masters in Aerospace Engineering from the Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Aeron\u00e1utica (ITA). His doctorate in Energetics is from Universit\u00e9 de Poitiers and Post-doctorate is from Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. He is presently an Associate Professor at the Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Rio de Janeiro, a researcher at the Centre National de La Recherche Scientifique, technical coordinator of the Fuel Energy Program in UNASUL (Uni\u00e3o das Nac\u00f5es da Am\u00e9rica do Sul).\n\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0\nThe Brazilian energy matrix has been changing in recent years in the attempt to reduce dependence on climatic factors by seeking flexibility in energy sources. Have the processes that depend on combustion for the generation of energy increased in the country? What is the perspective for the medium to long term?\nLu\u00eds Fernando Figueira da Silva - Only the electric energy generation matrix has been changing as indicated. The energy matrix depends 85 % on combustion according to the national energy balance from the MME (Ministry of Mines and Energy). This percentage does not change and is the same in most countries, industrialized or not.\nHow do the increasing awareness and the pressure felt by nations in search of more sustainable alternatives change the combustion processes in industry? In what way do these new necessities change research?\nLu\u00eds Fernando Figueira da Silva - In Brazil, there has been no change in the industrial area, which depends heavily on vegetal coal and oil products. In the area of biofuel use, research in Brazil missed the worldwide trend around twelve years ago, because shortsighted initiatives privileged the end use, without even addressing the fundamental questions of viability.\nRegulation of fuel dependent processes in the world has been increasingly rigorous and restrictive. How have these controls been carried out in the country? Are we still far behind the developed countries in the implantation of measures for the control and minimization of pollutants in industrial processes?\nLu\u00eds Fernando Figueira da Silva - Conama has been doing a good job of writing regulations. However, there does not appear to be an associated effort from the public authorities either to make the population aware or to inspect the progress.\nDue to factors such as fossil fuels and the pollution inherent in their burning becoming more expensive, old and new techniques to obtain alternative fuel sources have attracted increasing interest in recent years. In this sense, which initiatives in Brazil would you highlight?\nLu\u00eds Fernando Figueira da Silva- Rarely in history, have the fossil fuels been so plentiful and cheap. Brazil could have a road transport fleet that is more efficient than the present one, completely powered by ethanol, but has failed to seek this for decades, for example. Today, there is no alternative that is capable of supplying combustion in the processes necessary, or that is capable of generating energy in the way combustion does. The only recent advance that appears promising is synthesis, starting with sugarcane and utilizing a micro-organism, from farnesene, which is a molecule able to be used as a fuel in aviation.\nWhat are the objectives of your present research? What is its importance for industrial processes?\nLu\u00eds Fernando Figueira da Silva - To develop models of combustion for industrial processes, which require experiments aiming at incorporating physical-chemical phenomena and also computer modeling. For this reason, we are using experiments involving turbulent flames, which are representative of industrial processes, essentially associated with the oil refining chain.\nDuring one period of your career you worked in France. What are the principal differences that you perceived in the incentives that the government gives for students to qualify in the area of combustion? In this sense, what is the relationship between universities and industry?\nLu\u00eds Fernando Figueira da Silva - In the developed countries, the scholarship for post-graduation is a salary. It is low, albeit compatible with the offers from industry, and offers the right to social protection and a pension. It is not a copy of the payments from our development agencies, which effectively serve to discourage young talents from seeking involvement with research. In these countries, several industries employ qualified researchers to liaise with the universities, understand their missions and methods of working. There, research is also controlled by its results -qualification of personnel and scientific innovation - not as a means of managing employees to achieve it.\nResearch in Brazil in your area, just as in other areas of science, is carried out only in the universities. In developed countries, research in companies is a reality. How would you separate the research carried out by the academia from that carried out by industry in these countries? Could this model be adapted to Brazilian reality?\nLu\u00eds Fernando Figueira da Silva - In Brazil, there is also research carried out in non-university institutes; the case of Embrapa is a prime example. I believe that if financial conditions were offered to the best talents to continue a research career, a significant percentage of them would be capable of continuing outside the academic sphere."}]}}}
