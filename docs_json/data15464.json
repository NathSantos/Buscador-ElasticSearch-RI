Sendo os tratamentos convencionais, aplicados nas \nesta\u00e7\u00f5es de tratamento de \u00e1guas residuais (ETARs), ineficientes para a \nremo\u00e7\u00e3o destes contaminantes, as ETARs s\u00e3o apontadas como a principal fonte \nde f\u00e1rmacos no meio ambiente. O processo de adsor\u00e7\u00e3o, enquanto tratamento \navan\u00e7ado para a remo\u00e7\u00e3o de f\u00e1rmacos da \u00e1gua, em particular com o uso de \ncarv\u00f5es ativados (CAs), tem-se mostrado um processo de f\u00e1cil aplica\u00e7\u00e3o e \neficiente, sem forma\u00e7\u00e3o de subprodutos. \n\nComo a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de CAs pode ser um processo dispendioso, devido \naos requisitos energ\u00e9ticos e ao uso de precursores de elevado custo, a \nalternativa pir\u00f3lise em micro-ondas (MO) de lama prim\u00e1ria (LP) da ind\u00fastria \npapeleira pode ser uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o promissora, contribuindo simultaneamente para \na valoriza\u00e7\u00e3o de res\u00edduos industriais. Neste trabalho, os CAs foram produzidos \npor pir\u00f3lise em MO de LP impregnada com KOH (agente ativante) durante 10 \nmin a 800 W, lavados com \u00e1cido clor\u00eddrico e crivados para obten\u00e7\u00e3o da fra\u00e7\u00e3o \nde part\u00edculas com dimens\u00e3o inferior ou igual a 180 \u00b5m. Obtiveram-se diferentes \nCAs alterando as raz\u00f5es de agente ativante:precursor, nomeadamente 0.5:1, \n1:1 e 1.5:1. Os CAs produzidos foram f\u00edsica e quimicamente caraterizados. No \nsentido de avaliar o desempenho dos CAs produzidos, realizaram-se testes de \nadsor\u00e7\u00e3o em descont\u00ednuo com \u00e1gua ultra-pura para determinar a percentagem \nde adsor\u00e7\u00e3o do anti-epil\u00e9tico carbamazepina (CBZ). O efeito da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o \nde CA e o efeito do tempo de contacto tamb\u00e9m foram testados. \n\nOs resultados obtidos demonstraram que, de um modo geral, os CAs \nproduzidos numa raz\u00e3o de 0.5:1 de agente ativante:precursor apresentaram \n\u00e1reas superficiais espec\u00edficas (SBET) entre 773 e 1190 m2/g e elevadas \npercentagens de remo\u00e7\u00e3o de CBZ de solu\u00e7\u00f5es de \u00e1gua ultra-pura, acima de 80 \n%, para concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de CA de 0.1 g/L e tempos de contacto de 24 h. Os CAs \nproduzidos em laborat\u00f3rio demonstraram ter uma estrutura porosa mais \ndesenvolvida do que o CA comercial de refer\u00eancia e SBET compar\u00e1veis. Todavia, \npara as mesmas condi\u00e7\u00f5es experimentais, diferentes lotes de produ\u00e7\u00e3o \noriginaram CAs com propriedades e desempenhos diferentes, denotando que \nmais trabalho de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o deve ser investido de modo a otimizar o seu \nprocesso de produ\u00e7\u00e3o, tornando-o repet\u00edvel. \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n\n \nAdsorption; Activated Carbons; Chemical activation; Microwave pyrolysis; \nPharmaceuticals; Environment; Water treatment; Waste valorisation. \n\nabstract \n\n \nThe presence of pharmaceuticals in water bodies, being biologically \n\nactive compounds, have raised concerns due to the adverse effects in non-target \norganisms. With the conventional treatments, applied in the wastewater \ntreatment plants (WWTPs), being inefficient for the removal of these \ncontaminants, WWTPs are pointed out as the main source of pharmaceuticals \ninto the environment. The use of adsorption, as an advanced treatment for the \nremoval of pharmaceuticals from water, in particular by using activated carbons \n(ACs), has shown to be an easy-handling and cost-efficient process, without sub-\nproducts formation. \n\nSince the production of ACs can be an expensive process, due to the \nhigh energy requirements and the use of expensive precursors, the alternative \nmicrowave (MW) pyrolysis of paper mill primary sludge (PS) can be a promising \nsolution, contributing simultaneously for industrial waste valorisation. In the \nscope of this work, ACs were produced by MW pyrolysis of PS impregnated in \nKOH (activating agent) for 10 min at 800 W, washed with hydrochloric acid and \nsieved to obtain the fraction of particles with a size up to 180 \u00b5m. Different ACs \nwere obtained by changing activating agent:precursor ratios, namely 0.5:1, 1:1 \nand 1.5:1. The produced ACs were physico-chemically characterised. In order to \nassess the performance of the produced ACs, batch adsorption experiments \nwere performed with ultra-pure water to determine the adsorption percentages \nof the anti-epileptic carbamazepine (CBZ). The effect of AC dosage and the \neffect of contact time were also tested. \n\nThe obtained results have shown that, overall, the ACs produced with \nan activating agent:precursor ratio of 0.5:1 presented specific surface areas \n(SBET) between 773 and 1190 m2/g and high percentages of CBZ removed from \nultra-pure water solutions, above 80 %, for AC dosages of 0.1 g/L and a contact \ntime of 24 h. The lab-made ACs have shown a more developed porous structure \nthan the reference commercial AC and comparable SBET. Nevertheless, under \nthe same experimental conditions, different production batches resulted in ACs \nwith different properties and performances, highlighting that further research \nwork is required to optimise its production process, making it repeatable.  \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\ni \n \n\nContents \n\nLIST OF FIGURES ......................................................................................................................

WATER CONTAMINATION BY EMERGING CONTAMINANTS: THE \nPROBLEMATIC OF PHARMACEUTICALS \n\nPharmaceuticals are biologically active agents designed to induce physiological \n\nresponses in humans or animals (Calisto, 2011; Halling-Sorensen et al., 1998; Klatte et al., \n\n2017; Vasquez et al. 2014). These organic compounds are synthesized for the prevention, \n\ntreatment and reduction of diseases symptoms, which contributes for the improvement of \n\nhealth and quality of life. The continuous and increasingly consumption of pharmaceuticals \n\nworldwide is related to factors such as population growth, increase of life expectancy, \n\npopulation ageing, increase of chronical diseases, development of new and less expensive \n\ndrugs, to name a few (Calisto, 2011; Jelic et al., 2012; Kalaji &amp; Rastogi, 2017; OECD, 2015). \n\nAfter ingestion, pharmaceuticals are not completely metabolised by the human or \n\nanimal organism, and are excreted as unchanged substances (parent compounds) or \n\ntransformed products (metabolites) (Calisto, 2011; Halling-Sorensen et al., 1998; Rivera-\n\nUtrilla et al., 2013). Pharmaceuticals excreted by humans or animals, in their original or \n\nmetabolised form, follow different pathways as illustrated in Figure 1. Human excreted \n\nmedicines, usually pass through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) before they enter \n\ninto the environment. Unused or expired medications are also inappropriately disposed \n\ninto sinks/toilets or trash containers, ending up going to WWTPs or to landfills, respectively. \n\nIn what concerns veterinary medicine, excreted pharmaceuticals are more likely to enter \n\ndirectly into the environment through soil and/or water contamination without a prior \n\ntreatment at a WWTP (Halling-Sorensen et al., 1998; Khetan &amp; Collins, 2007; Klatte et al., \n\n2017; K\u00fcmmerer, 2001; Li et al., 2015; Ternes et al., 2004; Vasquez et al., 2014; Wang &amp; \n\nWang, 2016; Wilkinson et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2008). Regardless of their degree of \n\nmetabolization, excreted compounds can continue to be transformed by biotic and abiotic \n\nprocesses (by physico-chemical reactions such as oxidation, reduction and hydrolysis) in \n\nboth WWTPs and receiving water bodies (Halling-Sorensen et al., 1998; Rivera-Utrilla et al., \n\n2013; Vasquez et al., 2014; Verlicchi et al., 2012; Wilkinson et al., 2017). Pharmaceuticals \n\nmay be referred to as emerging contaminants (ECs), since they are degradation-resistant  \n\nsynthetic or natural compounds, that are still unregulated in what concerns environmental \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Introduction \n\n4 \n\nallowed levels, and have the potential to cause adverse effects to non-target organisms, \n\nincluding humans (Rivera-Utrilla et al., 2013; Rodriguez-Narvaez et al., 2017; Wilkinson et \n\nal., 2016).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Pathways for the entrance of pharmaceuticals into the environment (adapted from Calisto, 2011) \n\n \n\nWWTPs are designed to remove regulated contaminants such as pathogens, organic \n\nand inorganic compounds (in concentrations at mg/L range), by primary and secondary \n\ntreatments, in order to meet the effluent quality standards for its disposal into the water \n\nbodies (Bolong et al., 2009; Deblonde et al., 2011; Jelic et al., 2012; Verlicchi et al., 2012). \n\nNevertheless, WWTPs are considered to be the main point sources of pharmaceuticals into \n\nthe environment, since the conventional treatments are inefficient to remove ECs from the \n\nwastewaters, which results in their discharge and contamination of aquatic and terrestrial \n\necosystems (Bolong et al., 2009; Jelic et al., 2012; Klatte et al., 2017; Petrie et al., 2015; \n\n\n\nProduction of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n5 \n\nPetrovi? et al., 2003; Rivera-Utrilla et al., 2013). Tertiary treatments are optional and more \n\nexpensive processes, that can be applied at WWTPs in order to improve the quality of the \n\ndischarged effluent. These advanced treatments can be chemical, biological and physical \n\nprocesses (also addressed as phase-changing processes) (Jelic et al., 2012; Luo et al., 2014; \n\nRodriguez-Narvaez et al., 2017; Wang &amp; Wang, 2016). Advanced oxidation processes (AOP), \n\nmembrane processes, biological processes and adsorption onto activated carbon (AC), are \n\ncommonly addressed in literature as promising solutions to remove ECs from water, \n\nincluding pharmaceuticals (Bo et al., 2015; Luo et al., 2014; Rodriguez-Narvaez et al., 2017; \n\nWang &amp; Wang, 2016). \n\nDue to the development of analytical methodologies, pharmaceuticals were \n\ndetected in the environment as complex mixtures of several different classes of \n\npharmaceuticals, in their transformed or original form. Some of the detected classes \n\ninclude analgesics, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory, diuretics, beta-blockers, anti-\n\nhypertensive, hormones, psychiatric, anti-histamines, anti-epileptics and lipid regulators, \n\nwhich even in small quantities (ng to \u00b5g/L range) can adversely impact ecosystems (Calisto, \n\n2011; Rivera-Utrilla et al., 2013; Rodriguez-Narvaez et al., 2017; Vasquez et al., 2014). Klatte \n\net al. (2017) highlight the problem of disease resistance to pharmaceuticals due to the \n\nexposure to low concentration of ECs and warn about the low levels at which hormones \n\nstart having effects. The World Health Organization (WHO, 2014) also points out the \n\nproblem related to antibiotic resistance, since the projections indicate that, in the future, \n\neven infections from small injuries may lead to death. The presence of pharmaceuticals in \n\ndrinking water does not exceed trace levels (ng/L), so they would not cause an acute \n\nreaction (Klatte et al., 2017; K\u00fcmmerer, 2001; Rivera-Utrilla et al., 2013; Wilkinson et al., \n\n2016, 2017), however it increases the possibility of potential impacts due to a cumulative \n\neffect and life-cycle exposures (Gaffney et al., 2016; Rivera-Utrilla et al., 2013; Vasquez et \n\nal., 2014; Wilkinson et al., 2016). \n\nCarbamazepine (CBZ), the pharmaceutical studied under the scope of this work, is \n\nan anti-epileptic used for the treatment of mental disorders whose molecular structure is \n\nillustrated in Figure 2. It is a commonly detected pharmaceutical in WWTPs and surface \n\nwaters due to high ingestion levels (around 1000 mg per patient per day) and its high \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Introduction \n\n6 \n\nrecalcitrance to the conventional wastewater treatments (Bahlmann et al., 2014; Brezina \n\net al., 2017; Donner et al., 2013; Jelic et al., 2012; Luo et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2008). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Molecular structure of CBZ \n\n \n\nCBZ is highly metabolised by the liver, presenting metabolites as biologically active \n\nas the parent compound (Bahlmann et al., 2014; Jelic et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2008). \n\nBiological treatments at WWTPs are associated to the conversion of CBZ metabolites into \n\ntheir original forms, which can be related to higher concentrations of parent compound in \n\nthe effluent when compared to the influent (Luo et al., 2014). It is known that CBZ is \n\nresponsible to harmfully impact aquatic ecosystems, including invertebrates, fish and algae \n\n(Brezina et al., 2017), being crucial to develop feasible processes for its removal. \n\n \n\n1.2. REMOVAL OF PHARMACEUTICALS FROM CONTAMINATED WATER BY \nADSORPTION ONTO ACTIVATED CARBONS \n\n1.2.1. BASIC DESCRIPTION OF THE ADSORPTION PROCESS \n\nAdsorption is a surface phenomenon, which consists of the accumulation of \n\nparticles (atoms, ions or molecules) on a surface or interface, when it occurs between two \n\ndistinct physical states of matter such as liquid-solid, gas-solid or gas-liquid interfaces. The \n\nadsorbed component is the adsorbate, while the material in which particles are \n\nconcentrated is referred as the adsorbent (De Gisi et al., 2016; Snoeyink, 1990; Weber Jr., \n\n1972). Only adsorption between liquid-solid interfaces will be focused, since this work, as \n\ndescribed below, is aimed to study the adsorptive removal of pharmaceuticals from water \n\nby using AC.  \n\n\n\nProduction of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n7 \n\nSince the adsorbate can be polar or non-polar and neutral or electrically charged, \n\nthe adsorption process can occur due to electrostatic attraction, Van der Waals attraction \n\nor by covalent bond (Jaria, 2014; Weber Jr., 1972). Adsorption processes based on \n\nelectrostatic interaction, also called exchange adsorption, result from the concentration of \n\nions on charged sites of the adsorbent where they remain fixed. When results from weaker \n\ninteractions, such as Van der Waals interactions, adsorption is considered to be physical, \n\nphysisorption. If the adsorbate interacts with the adsorbent through stronger interactions, \n\nsuch as covalent bonds, the adsorption process is known as chemisorption. Physisorption, \n\nas opposed to chemisorption, is a reversible process, making it suitable for \n\nseparation/extraction methods (De Gisi et al., 2016; Weber Jr., 1972).  \n\nMolecules accumulate onto a solid surface until the amount of solute in the solution \n\nreaches a dynamic equilibrium with the amount of solute adsorbed onto the adsorbent, \n\nthat is, when the number of adsorbed and desorbed molecules is equal. In the equilibrium, \n\nthe amount of solute concentrated onto the adsorbent as a function of the adsorbate\u2019s \n\nconcentration, at constant temperature, can be described by an adsorption isotherm, as \n\nshown in Figure 3 (Bansal &amp; Goyal, 2005; De Gisi et al., 2016; Snoeyink, 1990; Weber Jr., \n\n1972). It expresses qe as a function of Ce where, qe is the adsorption capacity, that is, the \n\namount of adsorbed solute per unit of mass of adsorbent at the equilibrium (mg/g) and Ce \n\nis the concentration of solute in solution at the equilibrium (mg/L). A higher value of qe \n\nrepresents a more efficient adsorption, that is, more solute is accumulated onto the solid \n\nsurface, resulting in a lower concentration of adsorbate in the solution (De Gisi et al., 2016; \n\nSnoeyink, 1990; Weber Jr., 1972). The adsorption of solute molecules onto the surface of \n\nan adsorbent may occur in single or multimolecular layers. Langmuir, Brunauer-Emmett-\n\nTeller (BET) and Freundlich are some adsorption models that can be used to describe this \n\naccumulation process (Snoeyink, 1990; Weber Jr., 1972). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Introduction \n\n8 \n\n \n\nFigure 3. Example of the graphical representation of an adsorption isotherm \n\n \n\nThe adsorption process is influenced by factors related to the adsorbate/adsorbent \n\nproperties and operating conditions, as identified in Figure 4 (Ferreira, 2017; Luo et al., \n\n2014; Mansour et al., 2017; Snoeyink, 1990; Weber Jr., 1972), that are decisive for the \n\nremoval of contaminants, including pharmaceuticals.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4. Examples of adsorbent/adsorbate physico-chemical properties and operating conditions that \ninfluence the adsorption mechanism \n\n \n\nCalisto et al.

Mestre et al. \n\n(2014) referred the effect of the adsorbate molecular size on the adsorption process, in \n\nwhich the physically activated adsorbent presented the appropriate textural properties to \n\nadsorb the pharmaceutical with higher molecular weight. Bolong et al. (2009) addressed \n\nthe competition for the same adsorption active sites and/or pore blocking, which could \n\nreduce the rate of adsorption and/or imply the use of a higher dosage of adsorbent (Bolong \n\net al., 2009; Snoeyink, 1990). Considering the complexity of the adsorption process, only \n\nsome factors that affect the adsorption mechanism were briefly described.  \n\nBeing a surface process, adsorption is favoured by adsorbents with high specific \n\nsurface area (SBET) and well-developed porosity (Hesas et al.; Pel\u00e1ez-Cid et al., 2012; \n\nRodriguez-Narvaez et al., 2017). According to their nature, adsorbents may be \n\ncarbonaceous, such as AC, graphite and carbon nanotubes, or non-carbonaceous, like clay \n\nand silica (Akhtar et al., 2016; Baccar et al., 2012; Mansour et al., 2017; Rodriguez-Narvaez \n\net al., 2017). In the context of this work, only carbon-based adsorbents, namely ACs, will \n\nbe addressed. \n\nThe adsorbate solubility is a determining factor, since a low solubility in the aqueous \n\nsolution induces higher adsorption (Weber Jr., 1972). The octanol-water partitioning \n\ncoefficient (Kow) is related to the interaction of a solute with the adsorbent. In aqueous \n\nsolutions, high values of Kow are associated with adsorbates with lower affinity for water \n\nand therefore, a higher adsorption capacity. Contrarily, solutes with low Kow preferably \n\nremain in the liquid phase due to their higher affinity for water and therefore, are less \n\navailable to adsorb (Kushwaha et al., 2013; Mansour et al., 2017).  Considering the particle \n\nsize, adsorbates with a higher molecular weight, usually, tend to have lower uptake rates \n\nby microporous adsorbents, due to a limited access to the active sites of the adsorbent \n\n(Snoeyink, 1990; Weber Jr., 1972).  \n\nThe pH value is an important factor since it determines the ionization degree of the \n\nadsorbate in solution and the surface charge of the adsorbent, influencing the interactions \n\nbetween them (Kushwaha et al., 2013; Weber Jr., 1972). The point of zero charge (PZC) is \n\nrelated to the pH value at which the adsorbent surface charge is neutral (pH = pHpzc). \n\nPositively charged adsorbents can be related to surface protonation (in acidic media) when \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Introduction \n\n10 \n\npH &lt;pHpzc. The presence of basic surface functional groups also contributes for a net of \n\npositive charge at the adsorbent surface. In alkaline media, the negatively charged \n\nadsorbent surface is caused by the ionization of acidic functional groups when pH > pHpzc \n\n(Bansal &amp; Goyal, 2005; Kushwaha et al., 2013; Luo et al., 2014; Mansour et al., 2017; \n\nMoreno-Castilla, 2004).  \n\n \n\n1.2.2. ACTIVATED CARBON: DEFINITIONS AND APPLICATIONS \n\nACs, also called solid sponges, are the most commonly used adsorbents due to their \n\nability to cope with a great diversity of different molecules, organic and inorganic \n\ncontaminants, of different sizes  (De Gisi et al., 2016; Foo &amp; Hameed, 2010; Pel\u00e1ez-Cid et \n\nal., 2012). ACs are characterised by a system of micropores, SBET and a surface chemistry, \n\nwhich are the basis for their adsorption capacity. Because of their high adsorption capacity, \n\nideal for small molecules, their applications include air purification, water treatment, \n\ncolour, odour and taste removal (Jaria, 2014; Pel\u00e1ez-Cid et al., 2012; Sarici-Ozdemir &amp; Onal, \n\n2016; Yahya et al. , 2015).  Commercial AC can be obtained from several carbonaceous \n\nsources such as coal, lignite, wood and bones (Mansour et al., 2017; Pel\u00e1ez-Cid et al., 2012; \n\nWeber Jr., 1972). It is commonly produced as powder AC or granular AC, being the main \n\ndifference the particle\u2019s size and, subsequently, their distinct applications. Regarding the \n\nsize, the powder form has a dimension smaller than 0.1 mm, while granules comprise sizes \n\nbetween 0.6 and 4.0 mm (Bansal &amp; Goyal, 2005; Mansour et al., 2017). AC is mainly \n\ncomposed by carbon, conventionally between 85 and 95 % for commercial AC, being the \n\nremaining components oxygen, hydrogen, sulphur, nitrogen and inorganic ash. The \n\namounts of these elements depends on the precursor and production  process (Bansal &amp; \n\nGoyal, 2005). The ACs SBET can range between 500 and 3000 m2/g (Jaria, 2014; Pel\u00e1ez-Cid \n\net al., 2012; Weber Jr., 1972). \n\nACs adsorptive properties result from the thermal transformation of a \n\ncarbonaceous raw material, in which pores are formed due to the loss of volatile \n\ncompounds and the random rearrangement of the carbon structure. The adsorption \n\ncapacity improvement relies not only in the surface chemistry of the material, but also on \n\nthe ACs internal surface (Jaria, 2014; Pel\u00e1ez-Cid et al., 2012; Weber Jr., 1972).  \n\n\n\nProduction of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n11 \n\nThe internal surface is related to the well-developed porous structure of the AC, \n\nwhich indeed is the reason for its designation as activated (Jaria, 2014). According to the \n\nInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), pores can be classified as \n\nmicropores, mesopores and macropores if they are smaller than 2 nm, between 2 and 50 \n\nnm, and bigger than 50 nm, respectively (IUPAC, 2014). A system of pores with different \n\nsizes and shapes, randomly distributed, contributes for the increase of the area available \n\nfor adsorption, in which meso and macropores act as transport channels, allowing the \n\nadsorbate to access to micropores (Calisto et al., 2015; Jaria, 2014; Pel\u00e1ez-Cid et al., 2012; \n\nWeber Jr., 1972).   \n\nRegarding the chemical surface, ACs are composed by functional groups chemically \n\nbonded at the edges of the crystalline structure. The basicity of the AC surface is provided \n\nby functional groups such as carbonyls, chromenes, and pyrones, while the carboxylic \n\ngroups, lactones, phenols and anhydrides (oxygen-based groups) are responsible for the \n\nsurface acidic behaviour. Other groups such as hydroxyl, ether, quinone and anhydride can \n\nbe found at the carbon surface (Foo &amp; Hameed, 2012b, 2012a; Hesas et al., 2013; Yahya et \n\nal., 2015), as shown in Figure 5. The presence of these acidic and basic groups affects the \n\nsurface charges and the adsorbate/adsorbent interactions (Akhtar et al., 2016; Jaria, 2014; \n\nKushwaha et al., 2013; Yahya et al., 2015). Additionally, the reactivity of these functional \n\ngroups allows the surface functionalization of the ACs (Jaria, 2014).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5. Typical functional groups that can be present on the AC surface (Yahya et al., 2015) \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Introduction \n\n12 \n\nAvailable literature has pointed out the adsorption of pharmaceuticals onto AC as \n\nan attracting solution, highlighting advantages such as non-formation of by-products, \n\nversatility, good removal efficiency (at low concentrations of contaminants), low \n\noperational energy, non-selectivity and possibility for regeneration/reuse (\u00c1lvarez-\n\nTorrellas et al., 2016; Antunes et al., 2012; Calisto et al., 2017; Mansour et al., 2017; Mestre \n\net al., 2014; Sotelo et al., 2014). Nonetheless, these adsorbents are not widely used due to \n\ntheir high costs (De Gisi et al., 2016; Mansour et al., 2017) and because contaminants are \n\nnot mineralised (Pereira, 2017; Rodriguez-Narvaez et al., 2017). \n\n \n\n1.2.3. PRODUCTION OF ACTIVATED CARBON \n\nACs porous structure, SBET and surface chemistry, are highly influenced by the \n\nproduction process, that is, carbonaceous starting materials, carbonisation, activation and \n\noperating conditions (Hesas et al., 2013; Jaria, 2014; Pel\u00e1ez-Cid et al., 2012; Wahi et al., \n\n2017; Weber Jr., 1972). \n\nThe production of ACs combines the carbonisation of a starting carbonaceous \n\nmaterial with an activation process, that can be applied before, during or after \n\ncarbonisation. Carbonisation is the thermal degradation (around 800 \u00b0C) of the precursor \n\norganic fraction, that is, the elimination of most of the non-carbon species, such as oxygen, \n\nhydrogen and nitrogen, released as gaseous and liquid by-products. The remaining \n\nelemental carbon forms a rigid carbon skeleton, composed of aromatic irregularly arranged \n\nstructures and a rudimental porous structure (small and closed pores). In that sense, an \n\namorphous, lower density material is formed, exhibiting similar characteristics to the \n\nstarting material. Carbonisation is also referred to as pyrolysis, when it is carried out in an \n\ninert atmosphere (oxygen-free), provided by gases such as nitrogen (N2, commonly used) \n\nor argon, which also lead to a good porosity development. The activation of the \n\ncarbonaceous structure, which can be physical or chemical, promotes the porosity \n\ndevelopment by creating new pores, unblocking obstructed pores, enlarging and/or \n\nmerging the existing pores (Hesas et al., 2013; Jaria, 2014; Pel\u00e1ez-Cid et al., 2012; Wahi et \n\nal., 2017; Weber Jr., 1972).   \n\n\n\nProduction of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n13 \n\nIn the physical or thermal activation, the AC is produced in two distinct phases: \n\ncarbonisation and then activation. Carbonisation takes place in an inert atmosphere at \n\ntemperatures that can vary from 400 to 950 \u00b0C. The resulting carbon structure is then \n\nactivated, that is, pores are enlarged through a partial oxidation (gasification process) in an \n\noxidizing atmosphere of air, steam (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) or a combination of these \n\ngases at temperatures ranging from 800 to 1100 \u00b0C (Jaria, 2014; Mansour et al., 2017; \n\nPel\u00e1ez-Cid et al., 2012).   \n\nIn the chemical activation, carbonisation and activation (usually) occur \n\nsimultaneously. The precursor is impregnated with solutions of phosphoric acid (H3PO4), \n\nnitric acid (HNO3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), zinc chloride \n\n(ZnCl2) or potassium carbonate (K2CO3), to name a few activating agents, dried at 100 - 120 \n\n\u00b0C (or used as a paste, slurry), and then pyrolysed at temperatures between 400 and 800 \n\n\u00b0C. Activating agents differ in relation to the shape and size of the generated pores (since \n\nthey act as template) and the nature of the functional groups added onto the AC surface, \n\nwhich is also related to the activating agent:precursor ratio. After the activation process, \n\nACs need to be washed in order to remove residual activating agent and unblock obstructed \n\npores. Some environmental disadvantages include the corrosiveness and hazardousness of \n\nactivating agents, metal contamination (Jaria, 2014; Mansour et al., 2017; Pel\u00e1ez-Cid et al., \n\n2012) and eutrophication potential caused by the presence of phosphorous (Mestre et al., \n\n2011). Under these circumstances, K2CO3 is highlighted as being one of the most \n\nenvironmentally friendly chemical activating agent (Pel\u00e1ez-Cid et al., 2012).  \n\nChemical activation provides ACs with a higher SBET, lower energy demands, higher \n\ncontrol of the pore size distribution and shorter activation times when compared to \n\nphysical activation. However, the latter stands out for being cheaper, free from corrosive \n\nreagents and with no impurities coming from the activating agent (Jaria, 2014; Pel\u00e1ez-Cid \n\net al., 2012).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Introduction \n\n14 \n\n1.2.4. THE USE OF ALTERNATIVE PRECURSORS FOR ACTIVATED CARBON PRODUCTION \n\nIn the past few years, more attention has been given to the use of lignocellulosic \n\nmaterials for the production of AC, such as fruit peels/shells/stones, wood, grape bagasse, \n\nsisal, cork and cereal wastes, to name a few (Antunes et al., 2012; De Gisi et al., 2016; \n\nMestre et al., 2011, 2014; Pel\u00e1ez-Cid et al., 2012; Yahya et al., 2015). At a given point, these \n\nsources of biomass acted as a carbon dioxide sequester and their energy content resulted \n\nfrom solar radiation storage during the photosynthesis process, in which carbon dioxide \n\nand water were converted into oxygen and carbonaceous sources, including simple sugars, \n\nlipids and polymers such as starch, proteins, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin (Pel\u00e1ez-Cid \n\net al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2010). The use of these starting materials aroused interest due to \n\ntheir renewable nature, high carbon content, low cost and their large abundance, making \n\nthem more affordable than the commercial AC precursors (obtained from expensive and/or \n\nnon-renewable sources) (Ahmed &amp; Theydan, 2014a; Jaria, 2014; Kushwaha et al., 2013; \n\nMansour et al., 2017; Pel\u00e1ez-Cid et al., 2012; Yahya et al., 2015). The expensiveness of the \n\nACs includes factors such as the starting material source, the high energy requirements for \n\nthe production/regeneration process, costs related to the activation process and low \n\nproduction yields (Calisto et al., 2015; Pel\u00e1ez-Cid et al., 2012; Rodriguez-Narvaez et al., \n\n2017).  \n\nBesides agricultural precursors, the production of ACs from industrial wastes can be \n\nfavourable from both economic and environmental point of view. In the context of the \n\npresent work, paper mill primary sludge (PS), a waste derived from treatment of the \n\neffluents generated by the paper mill industry, was used for AC production purposes. \n\nPaper mill industry operates with large amounts of fresh water, generating high \n\nvolumes of effluents that require a prior treatment to assure the effluent quality standards \n\nbefore its disposal into water bodies (Adhikari &amp; Bhattacharyya, 2015; Pervaiz &amp; Sain, 2015; \n\nSoucy et al., 2014). PS is a carbon-rich waste, mainly composed by cellulose, hemicellulose \n\nand lignin, that results from flocculation/sedimentation operations applied during a \n\nprimary treatment. Then, the effluent is subjected to a biological treatment, in which the \n\norganic matter is degraded by the action of microorganism, from which biological sludge \n\n(BS) is obtained (Adhikari &amp; Bhattacharyya, 2015; Buruberri et al., 2015; Calisto et al., 2014; \n\n\n\nProduction of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n15 \n\nPervaiz &amp; Sain, 2015; Soucy et al., 2014). Paper mill industry is responsible for the \n\nproduction of significant amounts of sludge, around 45 kg of dry sludge per ton of paper \n\nproduced (Adhikari &amp; Bhattacharyya, 2015; Soucy et al., 2014). With an annual production \n\nhigher than 200 000 tons, sludge was pointed out as being the major fraction of solid waste \n\nproduced in the Portuguese mills from 2014 to 2016 (CELPA, 2016).  \n\nThe cruciality in reducing the volume of waste and the development of valorisation \n\nmeasures, in order to avoid landfilling, have been emphasised by the Waste Framework \n\nDirective (2008/98/EC) (European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, \n\n2008). Paper mill solid wastes are commonly landfilled, incinerated (for energy recovery) \n\nand used for agricultural purposes. Landfilling has been reducing over time and is \n\ndiscouraged due to environmental impacts (Buruberri et al., 2015; Monte et al., 2009; \n\nPervaiz &amp; Sain, 2015). To tackle with the high amounts of paper mill sludge, some waste \n\nmanagement/valorisation measures include its incorporation in building materials, road \n\nbuilding, composting (Monte et al., 2009), its use as wood adhesive and for biofuels \n\nproduction (Pervaiz &amp; Sain, 2015). Moreover, due to its carbonaceous nature, paper mill \n\nsludge can also be converted into ACs, contributing for the production of a cost-efficient \n\nadsorbent (Calisto et al., 2014; Jaria et al., 2017; Jiang &amp; Ma, 2011; Namazi et al. , 2015; \n\nPervaiz &amp; Sain, 2015). A process in which waste is re-inserted in the production chain and \n\nused as a secondary raw material for the production of value-added products, is fitted \n\nwithin a circular economy context. Contrarily, in a linear economy context, goods are \n\nproduced from primary sources, used and end-of-life products are disposed as useless \n\nwastes, according to a non-sustainable life cycle (Khalili et al., 2000; Liguori &amp; Faraco, 2016). \n\nConsidering the removal of pharmaceuticals from water, the ACs produced from \n\nboth agricultural (\u00c1lvarez-Torrellas et al., 2016; Mestre et al., 2011, 2014) and industrial \n\nwastes, specifically PS (Jaria et al., 2015, 2018), have shown results regarding SBET, \n\nadsorption capacity and adsorption kinetics, comparable to those obtained for commercial \n\nACs. The AC produced by Jaria et al. (2018) from conventional pyrolysis of PS, has shown to \n\nbe more efficient than the commercial AC to remove pharmaceuticals, even using a low \n\ndosage of absorbent, presenting a SBET between 1389 and 1627 m2/g and a removal \n\ncapacity around 78 % (overnight shaking at 80 rpm, 25 \u00b0C and an AC dosage of 0.015 g/L).  \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Introduction \n\n16 \n\n1.3. MICROWAVE PYROLYSIS: AN ALTERNATIVE TO CONVENTIONAL PYROLYSIS \nFOR ACTIVATED CARBON PRODUCTION \n\nMicrowave (MW) heating is a thermochemical process in which the heat is \n\nproduced by electromagnetic waves (frequency ranging from 300 MHz to 300 GHz). \n\nOverall, published studies address the production of ACs by MW pyrolysis in 2.45 GHz \n\nadapted domestic MWs (Foo &amp; Hameed, 2012c; Jones et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2010).  \n\nIn the conventional pyrolysis in a muffle furnace, samples are heated by conduction \n\nand convection mechanisms, from an external source, occurring a temperature gradient \n\nfrom the hot surface to the interior of the particle (Ahmed &amp; Theydan, 2014b; Ania et al., \n\n2005; Foo &amp; Hameed, 2012c; Hesas et al., 2013; Wahi et al., 2017). Since precursors with \n\ndifferent sizes and shapes are not uniformly heated during conventional heating, the \n\nrelease of the volatile compounds (gas diffusion) is not so effective, which can compromise \n\nthe AC properties (Ahmed &amp; Theydan, 2014b; Yang et al., 2010). Moreover, non-uniform \n\nheating requires higher heating times and energy inputs, and may also generate hotspots, \n\nthat is, regions in the precursor where the temperature can reach extremely high values \n\n(Hesas et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2002; Yang et al., 2010).  \n\nContrarily, MW radiation allows a rapid, uniform and selective heating. MWs are \n\nconverted into heat at the molecular level of the precursor. When a carbonaceous material \n\nis subjected to MW radiation, with a certain frequency, its molecules (with an induced or \n\npermanent dipole) react through a dipole rotation. In order to be oriented towards the \n\nopposite direction of the applied field, the movement of the molecules causes a molecular \n\nagitation, which generates heat (Ania et al., 2005; Jones et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2010; Yang \n\net al., 2010). Heating occurs by energy transference instead of heat transference (Hesas et \n\nal., 2013). In this context, temperature gradient occurs from the internal particles of the \n\nprecursor to its cold surroundings, allowing a volumetric, effective (energy saving) and \n\nfaster heating (Hesas et al., 2013; Saucier et al., 2015; Wahi et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2010). \n\nThus, this thermal gradient allows higher temperatures in the precursors interior, which \n\nprovides the volatilisation of low molecular weight compounds and the further \n\ndevelopment of pores (Hesas et al., 2013). Other advantages that can be pointed out \n\n\n\nProduction of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n17 \n\ninclude: (1) easiness of heating control, (2) higher production yield with well-developed \n\nporosity and SBET, (3) does not involve heating by convection, (4) it is a safer and easier \n\nmethodology to manipulate, (5) the equipment is smaller, (6) requires lower energy \n\ndemands and (7) produces less waste (Hesas et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2002; Li et al., 2009; \n\nWahi et al., 2017).  \n\nSuch as for the conventional pyrolysis, the starting material, heating temperature, \n\ngaseous atmosphere (gas type and flow rate), reaction time, physical/chemical activation \n\nagent, impregnation ratio (IR) and time, oxidative atmosphere, are some conditions that \n\nneed to be considered when applying MW radiation (Hesas et al., 2013; Wahi et al., 2017). \n\nThe main difference between conventional and MW heating is that, the sample heating \n\noccurs by manipulation of the MW power, which is indirectly related to the temperature. \n\nRadiation time is a determinant parameter given that longer heating periods can cause \n\nporous structure shrinkage, carbon burning and/or pores rupture, resulting in lower SBET. \n\nIn opposition, shorter radiation times and higher MW power favours porosity and SBET \n\ndevelopment (Hesas et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2010; Wahi et al., 2017).  \n\nContrarily to conventional pyrolysis, MW pyrolysis requires a prior activation since \n\ncarbonaceous precursors are transparent to MW radiation (Hesas et al., 2013; Liu et al., \n\n2010; Namazi et al., 2015; Saucier et al., 2015). The production of AC by MW pyrolysis can \n\nbe achieved in two different ways:  \n\ni. It can be produced by one-step chemical activation, in which the precursor is \n\nimpregnated with a chemical agent that acts as absorber of MW radiation. A \n\npaste, referred to as slurry, is formed which can be directly carbonised by MW \n\npyrolysis or can be previously dried (Hesas et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2010; Zaini &amp; \n\nKamaruddin, 2013); \n\nii. It can be a two-steps production, in which the precursor is activated by \n\nconventional pyrolysis, forming a rudimental carbon skeleton that acts as MW \n\nradiation absorber allowing the precursor to carbonise. Then, the carbonised \n\nmaterial can be physically/chemically activated and subjected to MW pyrolysis \n\n(Saucier et al., 2015; Zaini &amp; Kamaruddin, 2013). \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Introduction \n\n18 \n\nAs shown in Table 1, the production of ACs in one-step requires lower heating times \n\nand therefore, are less energy demanding than ACs produced by two-steps MW pyrolysis \n\n(Table 2). Results found in literature have shown that SBET values for ACs produced by \n\nconventional pyrolysis range between 600 and 1300 m2/g  (Baccar et al., 2012; Gonz\u00e1lez et \n\nal. , 2009; Mestre et al., 2011, 2014; Rajapaksha et al., 2014; Tay et al., 2009), while ACs \n\nproduced by MW pyrolysis exhibit higher SBET with values ranging between 700 and 2000 \n\nm2/g (Ahmed &amp; Theydan, 2012; Deng et al., 2009; Foo &amp; Hameed, 2012d, 2012b; Huang et \n\nal., 2011; Li et al., 2008, 2009; Liu et al., 2010; Saucier et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2010). \n\nDespite of the good properties attained for ACs produced by MW pyrolysis of \n\nalternative precursors, few studies address the use of paper mill sludge as precursor for \n\nthe production of ACs by MW radiation. Jiang and Ma (2011) applied MW radiation to paper \n\nmill sludge for waste disposal purposes, that is, to reduce the mass of sludge. Namazi et al. \n\n(2015) produced ACs by combining PS and BS (1:1 ratio); Nevertheless, the authors did not \n\ntest the adsorption capacity of the produced materials. As far as it is known, there are no \n\nstudies of paper mill sludge-based ACs, obtained through MW pyrolysis, to remove \n\npharmaceuticals from water. Taking into account the large availability of this carbonaceous \n\nwaste and the limitations related to the use of expensive ACs for water treatment, the \n\nproduction of ACs by MW pyrolysis of PS seems to be an optimist solution. \n\n\n\nProduction of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n19 \n\n \n\nTable 1.

ANALYTICAL QUANTIFICATION OF PHARMACEUTICALS: BASIC DESCRIPTION \nOF CAPILLARY ELECTROPHORESIS \n\nIn the scope of this work, the quantification of CBZ in aqueous phase was carried \n\nout through capillary electrophoresis. Capillary electrophoresis is a separation technique \n\nthat lays down in the separation of charged molecules through their movement in a fluid \n\nwhen subjected to a constant external electric field. A thin capillary, with a thickness in the \n\n?m range, is used as a physical support for the molecules to get separated (Calisto, 2011; \n\nOliveira, 2017). The electrophoretic separation requires an electric current input, vials \n\ncontaining samples and electrolytes, two metallic electrodes at the inlet and outlet, a silica \n\ncapillary (and therefore composed by silanol functional groups suitable for \n\nfunctionalisation purposes), a detection system and a software to operate the instrument \n\nand manage data acquisition and processing (Calisto, 2011), as illustrated in Figure 6.   \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6. Schematic representation of capillary electrophoresis system \n\n \n\nHigh performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), is a separative technique that \n\ncould also be considered for pharmaceutical quantification purposes. Nevertheless, when \n\ncompared to HPLC, capillary electrophoresis exhibits advantages such as (Calisto, 2011; \n\nOliveira, 2017): \n\n- The use of smaller amounts of reagents; \n\n- Capillaries are less expensive than HPLC columns; \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Introduction \n\n22 \n\n- Capillaries are more versatile, in the sense that the stationary phase can be \n\nmodified through capillary coatings or by adding a pseudostationary phase; \n\n- Allows the separation of molecules in a wide range of molecular weights and \n\ncharges; \n\n- Presents a higher separation resolution than HPLC. \n\nThe electrophoretic separation is a consequence of two driving forces, \n\nelectrophoretic mobility and electroosmotic flow (EOF). Electrophoretic mobility is related \n\nto the movement of charged molecules due to an electrostatic force originated by the \n\napplied electric field. Moreover, as a result of the applied electric field, a liquid flow known \n\nas EOF is formed when the electrolyte contacts the charged inner walls of the capillary.  \n\nCapillary electrophoresis can occur in several separation modes, being the simplest \n\none known as capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). In CZE, sample is injected into a capillary \n\nfilled with electrolytic solution, also mentioned as buffer, to allow the analyte molecules to \n\nbe separated. A constant electric field is applied when the two extremities of the capillary \n\nare immersed in the buffer, generating an electric potential difference, which causes the \n\nmigration of the charged molecules along the capillary towards the detector. Since this \n\nseparation mode was limited to charged molecules, it was necessary to adopt measures to \n\nassure the mobility of neutral molecules. Electrokinetic capillary chromatography was \n\ndeveloped in order to overcome this constraint, by introducing a pseudostationary phase \n\nin the separation buffer, combining concepts of both CZE and chromatography. Surfactants \n\nare commonly added to the separation buffer, in which the surfactant molecules involve \n\nthe neutral molecules in the aqueous solution by forming micelles, referred to as \n\npseudostationary phase. This separation mode is named micellar electrokinetic \n\nchromatography (MEKC). The neutral analytes, involved in the micelles, also migrate \n\nthrough electrophoretic mobility and EOF. Sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) is commonly \n\nused as surfactant, which allows the formation of negatively charged micelles that migrate \n\ntowards the outlet vial (Calisto, 2011; Oliveira, 2017). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nProduction of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n23 \n\n1.5. MAIN GOALS OF THE PRESENT WORK \n\nThis work aims to produce ACs by MW pyrolysis of paper mill PS to remove CBZ \n\nfrom water. Specific goals of this work include: \n\n \n\n- To evaluate the effect of IR between precursor and activating agent in the \n\nresulting AC; \n\n- To evaluate the repeatability of the AC production process; \n\n- To characterise the produced ACs by determining the total organic carbon (TOC) \n\ncontent, the SBET and total pore volume (VP); \n\n- To assess the adsorptive performance of the produced ACs to remove CBZ, \n\nthrough batch adsorption tests in ultra-pure water for different dosages of AC;  \n\n- To evaluate how the mass of AC and the contact time between \n\nadsorbent/adsorbate affect the adsorption of CBZ onto the AC, through \n\nadsorption experiments in batch mode. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Introduction \n\n24 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\nCHAPTER 2: MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Materials and methods \n\n26 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nProduction of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n27 \n\n2.1. REAGENTS \n\nPS was chemically activated with KOH (Akzo Nobel) in pellets form. The produced \n\nACs were washed with a solution of hydrochloric acid (? 37 %, Fluka).  \n\nThe adsorption tests were performed with CBZ (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), which was \n\nquantified by capillary electrophoresis using the following chemicals: sodium dodecyl \n\nsulphate PA-ACS (Panreac), sodium tetraborate (borax, Riedel-de Haen), hexadimethrine \n\nbromide (polybrene, Sigma-Aldrich), sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide (VWR), \n\nethylvanillin (99%, Aldrich), acetonitrile (Chem-Lab, HPLC grade). \n\nFor IC determination a diluted solution of phosphoric acid (85 % for analyses -ACS-\n\nISO, Panreac) was used. \n\nExcept the washing acid solution, that was prepared with distilled water, all the \n\nsolutions were prepared with ultra-pure water obtained from a Milli-Q Millipore system \n\n(Milli-Q plus 185). \n\n \n\n2.2. PRODUCTION OF ACTIVATED CARBONS \n\nACs were produced by one-step chemical \n\nactivation and MW pyrolysis of paper mill PS. The \n\nprecursor was provided by a Portuguese paper \n\nmill industry that applies a chemical process \n\n(chlorine free) known as kraft process, to \n\neucalyptus wood (Eucalyptus globulus). According \n\nto the procedure described by Calisto et al. \n\n(2014), PS was collected and subjected to two \n\ndrying steps: dried at room temperature for \n\nseveral days and then dried at 60 \u00b0C in an oven for \n\n24 h. Subsequently, PS was grinded with a blade \n\nmill (Figure 7). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7. Dried paper mill primary sludge \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Materials and methods \n\n28 \n\nPS was then chemically activated with KOH and three activating agent:precursor \n\nratios were tested: 0.5:1, 1:1 and 1.5:1 (w/w). For each carbon produced, a mixture was \n\nprepared in a proportion of 9 mL of ultra-pure water per 3 g of precursor and the \n\ncorresponding mass of KOH for each IR. Both precursor and activating agent were weighted \n\non an analytical balance with an uncertainty of \u00b1 0.0001 g. After homogenisation, the \n\nsample was impregnated for 1 h in an ultrasonic bath at room temperature. \n\nThe slurry (precursor impregnated with activating agent) was placed into a \n\ncylindrical quartz reactor (2.2 cm diameter x 38.5 cm length), which was held in the reactor \n\nwith a folded cone-shaped glass fibre filter (Whatman, 47 mm). The reactor was inserted \n\nvertically, as shown in Figure 8, into a modified Samsung MW furnace (2.45 GHz) with an \n\nadjustable power between 100 and 800 W.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8. Experimental apparatus used in this work: (a) Quartz reactor; (b) Experimental setup used for MW \npyrolysis; (c) Slurry placed inside the quartz reactor in the MW furnace \n\n \n\nThe bottom of the reactor was tapered and connected to a N2 flow. The top of the \n\nreactor was surrounded by a removable metallic cover (7.5 cm length), which was attached \n\nto a silica exhaust pipe (0.8 cm diameter x 38 cm length) from which the pyrolysis gases \n\nwere expelled (Figure 8). The MW pyrolysis was performed under an inert atmosphere after \n\na 15 min purge with a N2 flow, ensuring the removal of oxygen from the reaction system. \n\n\n\nProduction of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n29 \n\nThe slurry was pyrolysed for 10 min at a radiation power of 800 W. The N2 flow was kept \n\nuntil the carbonised sample was cooled to room temperature, for about 10 min. \n\nThe carbonised material was removed from the reactor, milled and soaked with a \n\n1.2 M HCl solution at a 50 mL/g liquid to solid ratio. This procedure, not only allowed the \n\nremoval of residual KOH activating agent, but also promoted the unblocking of the \n\nobstructed pores by inorganic material (ashes). The material remained suspended in the \n\nacid solution for 1 h, similarly to the procedure described in Oliveira (2017), after which it \n\nwas vacuum filtered and repeatedly washed with distilled water until neutral pH of the \n\nwashing solution was achieved. The AC was then dried at 105 \u00b0C for 48 h, weighed, sieved \n\nto obtain the fraction of particles with a size up to 180 ?m and stored in polypropylene \n\nvessels for further experiments. The production of ACs is summarised in Figure 9. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9. Stages of the ACs production performed in the present work \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Materials and methods \n\n30 \n\nThe production yield was determined as the ratio between the mass of the \n\nproduced AC and the initial mass of precursor, both weighted in dry basis, \n\n \n\nYield (%) =  \nmi\n\nm0\n \u00d7 100     (1) \n\n \n\nwhere m0 is the mass of PS and mi is the mass of the produced carbon after activation, \n\ngrinding, washing and drying. \n\nAll the materials were produced in triplicate to evaluate the repeatability of the \n\nprocess, resulting in a total of nine ACs. The produced materials were named according to \n\nthe production conditions, namely, precursor (PS), activating agent (KOH), activating \n\nagent:precursor ratio and the production batch (first, second or third production). For \n\nexample, PS-KOH-0.5:1-1batch is related to the AC obtained from PS, chemically activated \n\nwith KOH in a 0.5:1 (activating agent:precursor) ratio during the first production (1 batch). \n\nThe same analogy was considered to name the remaining produced ACs. \n\nPreliminary tests were performed, consisting of the MW pyrolysis of the PS without \n\nactivating agent or with lower quantity of activating agent (in a proportion of 0.1:1) and no \n\ncarbonisation was achieved.  \n\n \n\n2.3. CHARACTERISATION OF ACTIVATED CARBONS \n\n2.3.1. TOTAL ORGANIC CARBON \n\nTotal organic carbon (TOC) was determined for the precursor and for the produced \n\nACs by difference between total carbon (TC) and inorganic carbon (IC), which were analysed \n\nin a TOC-VCPH Shimadzu analyser, with a solid sample module SSM-5000A. For both TC and \n\nIC determination, a blank test was carried out at the beginning of each work session, using \n\nan empty porcelain crucible. Glucose (C6H12O6, corresponding to 40 % of carbon), was used \n\nto test the calibration curve previously made for TC determination, while sodium carbonate \n\n(Na2CO3, corresponding to 11% of carbon) was the control standard used for IC \n\ndetermination. The carbon content of the precursor and ACs was determined as the \n\n\n\nProduction of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n31 \n\naverage of three replicates whenever the amount of AC allowed it. For IC determination, 4 \n\nmL of phosphoric acid:water (1:2) was added into the porcelain crucibles (blank and \n\nsamples). The samples were weighed in a microbalance with an uncertainty of \u00b1 0.001 mg. \n\n \n\n2.3.2. SPECIFIC SURFACE AREA (SBET) AND POROSITY \n\nThe determination of SBET and porosity were accomplished through a collaboration \n\nwith Instituto Nacional del Carb\u00f3n (INCAR \u2013 CSIC), Oviedo, Spain. SBET was obtained from a \n\nMicromeritics equipment (Gemini VII 2380) using nitrogen adsorption isotherms at -196 \u00b0C \n\nand applying the BET model in the relative pressure range of 0.01 to 0.1. Samples were \n\nsubmitted to a degasification process at 120 \u00b0C overnight. VP was determined from the \n\namount of nitrogen adsorbed at a relative pressure of 0.99. Dubinin-Astakhov equation was \n\napplied to the lower relative pressure zone of the nitrogen adsorption isotherm to obtain \n\ntotal micropore volume (W0). SBET and VP were determined for all the materials except for \n\nthe precursor.  \n\n \n\n2.4. BATCH ADSORPTION TESTS \n\n2.4.1. BATCH ADSORPTION TESTS WITH THE PRODUCED ACTIVATED CARBONS \n\nAdsorption tests in batch mode were carried out to assess the adsorption of CBZ \n\nonto the nine produced ACs. For that purpose, solutions of CBZ were prepared in ultra-pure \n\nwater, with an initial concentration of 5 mg/L. CBZ and ACs were weighed in a microbalance \n\nwith an uncertainty of \u00b1 0.001 mg. \n\nStudies were carried out for each AC at different dosages, namely 0.025, 0.05 and \n\n0.1 g/L. The weighed carbon (1 mg) was transferred to polypropylene tubes with a total \n\ncapacity of 50 mL, and the corresponding volume of 5 mg/L pharmaceutical solution was \n\nadded in order to achieve the intended AC dosage, as summarised in Table 3. All the tests \n\nwere performed, at least, in triplicate.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Materials and methods \n\n32 \n\nTable 3.

Then, control and samples were \n\nfiltered through a 0.22 ?m PVDF syringe filter (13 mm diameter, Whatman), as shown in \n\nFigure 10, to stop the adsorption process by removing the adsorbent. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10. On the left, samples and the control after conclusion of an adsorption test; On the right, the \nsyringe filter system \n\n \n\nControl and samples were analysed by capillary electrophoresis, as described in \n\nSection 2.5., in order to determine the concentration of pharmaceutical that remained in \n\nthe aqueous phase. The percentage of CBZ adsorbed was determined by the difference \n\nbetween the initial concentration of pharmaceutical, given by the control test, and the \n\nconcentration of CBZ that remained in the aqueous phase of each sample after filtration, \n\n\n\nProduction of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n33 \n\nAdsorption (%) =  \nC0?Cf\n\nC0\n\u00d7 100    (2) \n\n \n\nwhere C0 is the initial concentration of CBZ provided by the control test and Cf is the \n\nconcentration of CBZ that remained in the aqueous phase. The adsorption percentage of \n\neach AC was determined as the average of all replicates. \n\nDue to the small masses of AC used to achieve the desired AC dosage in the \n\ndescribed experiments, some tests were performed to assess the possibility of AC adhesion \n\nonto the walls and lids of the propylene tubes, which might have a significant impact in the \n\nAC that is effectively in contact with the pharmaceutical solution. For this purpose, and \n\nmaintaining the same final AC dosage, higher masses of AC were used and some of the \n\ndescribed batch adsorption tests were repeated. Due to the limited quantities of AC \n\nproduced, tests using 2 mg of adsorbent were applied to only four ACs, namely, PS-KOH-\n\n0.5:1-2batch, PS-KOH-1:1-2batch, PS-KOH-0.5:1-3batch and PS-KOH-1:1-3batch, to achieve \n\nthe final AC dosage of 0.05 and 0.1 g/L. Experiments using 3 mg of AC could only be \n\nperformed for PS-KOH-0.5:1-3batch and PS-KOH-1:1-3batch, for an AC dosage of 0.1 g/L, \n\nas shown in Table 4. Tests were not performed for an AC dosage of 0.025 g/L, since the \n\nmaximum volume of 50 mL of the polypropylene tubes would inevitably require 1 mg of AC \n\nper 40 mL of pharmaceutical solution, considering that the concentration of the \n\npharmaceutical solution was not changed. \n\n \n\nTable 4.

After capillary \n\nelectrophoresis analyses, the adsorption percentages were determined according to \n\nEquation 2. \n\n \n\n2.4.2. EVALUATION OF THE EFFECT OF CONTACT TIME \n\nIn order to confirm if the adsorbent/adsorbate contact time was enough for \n\nattaining the maximum removal percentages at the studied conditions, 49 and 72 h \n\nadsorption tests were also performed for the ACs PS-KOH-0.5:1-2batch and PS-KOH-0.5:1-\n\n3batch. The experiments were performed using 1 and 2 mg of AC to achieve the final AC \n\ndosage of 0.05 and 0.1 g/L. The experimental conditions were the same as described in \n\nSection 2.4.1. \n\n \n\n2.5. QUANTIFICATION OF CARBAMAZEPINE BY CAPILLARY ELECTROPHORESIS \n\nThe quantification of the CBZ was performed in a Beckman P/ACE MDQ \n\nelectrophoresis equipment, equipped with a UV-Vis photodiode array detector, operated \n\nwith the software 32 Karat. The pharmaceutical was quantified according to a MEKC \n\nmethod by using a dynamically coated capillary and an electrolyte buffer consisting of 30 \n\nmM of SDS and 15 mM of sodium tetraborate (borax).  \n\nBefore the first usage, a silica capillary of 40 cm length (75 ?m inner diameter and \n\n375 ?m external diameter), 30 cm to the detection window, was coated, as described in \n\nTable 5. A 1 M NaOH solution was used for the activation of the silanol groups and \n\nhexadimethrine bromide (polybrene) was responsible for adding positively charged \n\nfunctional groups. In order to avoid the capillary blocking, all the reagents (buffer, \n\npolybrene and NaOH), samples including, were previously filtered through 0.22 ?m PVDF \n\nfilters (Whatman). \n\nSeparation was carried out at 25 \u00b0C by applying an electric field of 25 kV, for \n\napproximately 3.6 min. The detection of CBZ occurred at 214 nm, according to the \n\npharmaceutical absorption spectra. Ethylvanillin was used as internal standard (IS) and \n\nadded to all the samples at an initial concentration of 167 mg/L. Samples were injected by \n\n\n\nProduction of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n35 \n\npressure, implying non-repeatable injection volumes; For that reason, the IS was used for \n\npharmaceuticals quantification purposes through the ratio between the CBZ peak area and \n\nthe IS peak area (ACBZ/AIS). The experimental conditions used for capillary electrophoresis \n\nanalysis are listed in Table 5. Each sample, that is, control and each replicate from the \n\nadsorption experiments, was analysed in triplicated.  \n\n \n\nTable 5.

Figure 11 represents an example of an electropherogram, in which the first peak \n\nrepresents EOF, the peak with a migration time around 1.7 min corresponds to the IS, and \n\naround 2.7 min there is the peak corresponding to CBZ that remained in the aqueous phase. \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Materials and methods \n\n36 \n\n \n\nFigure 11.

CALIBRATION CURVE \n\nTo estimate the concentration of CBZ a calibration curve was performed for each \n\ncapillary renewal. \n\nSeven standards with concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mg/L were \n\nprepared by dilution of a 5 mg/L stock solution in 5 mL volumetric flasks. The standards \n\nwere quantified by MEKC according to the experimental conditions described in Table 5 \n\n(Section 2.5.). The standards were analysed in quadruplicate. A linear calibration curve was \n\nobtained by applying the least-squares linear regression, in which the ACBZ/AIS ratio was \n\nrepresented as a function of the pharmaceutical concentration, according to the equation: \n\n \n\ny = mx + b      (3) \n\n \n\nwhere y is ACBZ/AIS, x is the concentration of CBZ, m is the slope and b is the intercept on \n\nthe y-axis.  \n\nThe limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were determined by the \n\ncalibration curve method, according to International Conference on Harmonization (2005) \n\nguidelines.

PRODUCTION OF ACTIVATED CARBONS \n\nAs mentioned previously, three production batches were carried out, in the exact \n\nsame experimental conditions for three different IRs, from which nine ACs resulted. During \n\nthe slurry carbonisation it was observed the formation of flame and incandescence, whose \n\nintensity and duration varied with the IR, being more pronounced for lower concentrations \n\nof activating agent. For the slurry with an IR of 0.5:1 (activating agent:precursor), flame \n\nformation/incandescence occurred intense and continuously in the initial heating minutes \n\n(3 \u2013 4 min), becoming intermittent over the process, until at the end it was not observed. \n\nConsidering the slurry with the IR of 1:1, when flame formation/incandescence occurred, \n\nit was observed for smaller periods of time, when compared to 0.5:1 ratio. Finally, for the \n\n1.5:1 slurry carbonisation no flame was observed, and when incandescence occurred, it \n\nwas intermittent and for short periods of time. These experimental occurrences may be \n\nrelated to the carbonisation rate, in the sense that for the materials in which the flame \n\nformation/incandescence was more intense (0.5:1 ratio), the final ACs presented a more \n\nblackish appearance, which may be related to a more complete carbonisation (Figure 12). \n\nThe achievement of a \u201ccomplete\u201d carbonisation with lower concentrations of KOH can be \n\nan advantageous feature in the economic point of view.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 12. ACs produced in the activating agent:precursor ratio of 0.5:1 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and discussion \n\n42 \n\nFor the materials in which the flame formation/incandescence was less intense, 1:1 \n\nand 1.5:1 ratios, the final ACs still presented some brownish fractions, probably due to the \n\nincomplete carbonisation of the precursor as shown in Figure 13 and Figure 14, \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 13. ACs produced in the activating agent:precursor ratio of 1:1 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 14. ACs produced in the activating agent:precursor ratio of 1.5:1 \n\n \n\nAs shown in Figure 15, the production yield (calculated by Equation 1) did not varied \n\nsignificantly for ACs within the same IR, nevertheless, there was a slight difference for ACs \n\nproduced with different IRs, being PS-KOH-0.5:1, the AC obtained with higher product yield. \n\n \n\n\n\nProduction of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n43 \n\n \n\nFigure 15. Production yield (%) of the produced ACs \n\n \n\nTable 1 (Section 1.3.) summarises the production conditions, yield and textural \n\nproperties of ACs available in literature, produced by one-step MW pyrolysis of alternative \n\nprecursors, similarly to those used in the present work. For comparative purposes, PS-KOH-\n\n0.5:1 was considered with an average yield of 11 \u00b1 1 %, which is slightly lower than the \n\nproduction yields reported in literature. \n\nOverall, losses during the production are significant, in the way that 3 g of PS \n\noriginated approximately 300 mg of AC. Besides the inevitable losses that occurred \n\nthroughout the production stages, it was found that the step that had major influence in \n\nthe obtained yield was the acid washing. As mentioned in previous studies (Calisto et al., \n\n2017; Jaria et al., 2015, 2017; Pereira, 2017), these losses can be related to the removal of \n\nthe inorganic material, such as ashes, improving microporosity and SBET due to the \n\nunblocking of obstructed pores.  \n\nIt should be noted that the chemical activation of carbonaceous materials produces \n\nadsorbents with a well-developed porosity, which may result in lighter materials and \n\ntherefore, lower production yields. Nevertheless, the production yield of the produced ACs \n\ndecreases by increasing the concentration of the activating agent, which was not attributed \n\nto a well-developed porous structure since Vp also decreases with the increase of KOH \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and discussion \n\n44 \n\nconcentration, as shown in Table 6 (Section 3.2.2.). These losses may be related to a higher \n\ndecomposition of the precursor due to the reaction with KOH.  \n\nPreliminary experiments of the MW pyrolysis of PS in the absence of the activating \n\nagent or lower quantity of activating agent (activating agent:precursor of 0.1:1), \n\ndemonstrated that no carbonisation was achieved. These results are an evidence that the \n\nactivating agent not only promotes structural changes through the formation of new pores \n\nand/or widening the existing ones, but also promotes the production of char by acting as \n\nMW radiation absorber.  \n\nThe production process of the ACs by MW pyrolysis presented some inherent \n\nvariables difficult to control, such as: \n\n- The equipment used for MW pyrolysis was a domestic MW, in which the heating \n\nprocess was assisted by a rotatory plate. The modifications to the MW, \n\ndescribed in Section 2.2., did not allowed the sample to be heated in a rotatory \n\nmovement, which means that uniformity of radiation inside the equipment \n\ncould not be guaranteed; \n\n- The quartz reactor was built analogously to other reactors described in \n\nliterature allowing small dosages of slurry. Also, due to its shape, it was difficult \n\nto assure a homogeneous sample packaging for each production; \n\n- Contrarily to conventionally heated experiments in muffle furnaces, the \n\nreaction temperature could not be measured; \n\n- To assure oxygen-free conditions, the system was purged with N2 before \n\npyrolysis. When regulating the N2 flow the slurry was slightly vertically \n\ndislocated. According to the experiments carried out, it is not possible to assure \n\nif this displacement could (or not) move the slurry, to a position out of the \n\noptimal radiative field. Similarly, the carbonised material could be displaced by \n\nthe N2 flow during heating.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nProduction of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n45 \n\n3.2. CHARACTERISATION OF ACTIVATED CARBONS \n\n3.2.1. TOTAL ORGANIC CARBON \n\nThe ACs were produced from a starting material composed by 30.5 \u00b1 0.3 % of TC, \n\n4.4 \u00b1 0.2 % of IC and therefore 26.0 \u00b1 0.4 % of TOC. Figure 16 shows that MW pyrolysis \n\npromoted an increase of the OC content in the obtained ACs. The results reinforce that MW \n\npyrolysis, along with the acid washing, is responsible for the removal of most IC content, \n\nreducing it to negligible values (under 0.2 %).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 16. Carbon content of the PS, produced ACs and the commercial AC (PBFG4) used as reference. \n*Data published in Jaria et al. (2018) \n\n \n\nThe carbon content of the ACs produced by MW pyrolysis were compared to ACs \n\nproduced by conventional pyrolysis of PS. According to the production conditions described \n\nin Jaria et al. (2018), the ACs were named as CPy-PS800-150KOH-1:1, CPy-PS800-60KOH-\n\n1:1, CPy-PS650-150KOH-1:1 and CPy-PS650-60KOH-1:1, corresponding to the conventional \n\npyrolysis of PS impregnated with KOH (1:1 ratio), at temperatures of 650 or 800 \u00b0C for 60 \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and discussion \n\n46 \n\nor 150 min. Also for comparison purposes, it was considered a commercial powder AC \n\nnamed PULSORB FG4 (PBFG4), provided by ChemViron Carbon.  \n\nOverall, the MW pyrolysed ACs have TOC values ranging between 42.5 \u00b1 0.5 % and \n\n49.6 \u00b1 0.4 %, representing low values when compared to the commercial AC PBFG4 with \n\n77.5 \u00b1 0.1 % of TOC (data published in Jaria et al., 2018). The ACs produced by conventional \n\npyrolysis present higher TOC than the ACs produced by MW radiation, with CPy-PS650-\n\n150KOH-1:1 and CPy-PS650-60KOH-1:1 presenting around 54.9 \u00b1 0.1 % and CPy-PS800-\n\n150KOH-1:1 and CPy-PS800-60KOH-1:1 around 67 \u00b1 1 % (Jaria et al., 2018). Considering the \n\nACs obtained by conventional pyrolysis, the increase in temperature resulted in an increase \n\nof TOC, raising the question of whether or not the increase of MW radiation time could \n\nincrement the carbon content. Contrarily to conventional pyrolysis, the temperature to \n\nwhich the sample was subjected during the MW heating could not be measured. As \n\nmentioned in Section 1.3., the MW power is indirectly related to the temperature, which \n\nin this particular case could not be increased since the maximum power of the equipment \n\nis 800 W. Therefore, the only variable that could be manipulated during the carbonisation \n\nprocess would be radiation time. \n\n \n\n3.2.2. SPECIFIC SURFACE AREA (SBET) AND POROSITY \n\nTable 6 summarises the results obtained for SBET and porous structure of the \n\nproduced ACs. Both Table 6 and Figure 17 support the high variability within ACs with the \n\nsame IR from different batches that were obtained under the same experimental \n\nconditions. The variability of SBET (and VP) is more pronounced for ACs obtained with higher \n\nconcentration of activating agent (1.5:1 ratio), showing a relative standard deviation (RSD) \n\nof 48 %. Within the ACs produced with a 0.5:1 ratio, the variability of SBET in relation to the \n\nmean was less pronounced, showing a RSD of 23 %. One observes some consistency of the \n\nobtained results for both PS-KOH-0.5:1 and PS-KOH-1:1 from the second and third batches. \n\nThe AC with the lower IR (PS-KOH-0.5:1) presents better textural properties, with \n\nan average SBET of 946 \u00b1 217 m2/g and an average VP of 0.72 \u00b1 0.13 cm3/g. PS-KOH-0.5:1-\n\n1batch stands out from the other two batches under the same experimental conditions \n\nwith a SBET of 1190 m2/g, which may be due to some experimental constraints, in which the \n\n\n\nProduction of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n47 \n\nprecursor remained impregnated in the activating agent for 4 h instead 1 h. Overall, SBET \n\nand Vp decrease with the increase of the activating agent concentration, which is in line \n\nwith data published by Saucier et al. (2015) and Thue et al. (2016).  \n\n \n\nTable 6.

Overall, the \n\nadsorbents exhibit a well-developed microporous structure, allowing the enhancement of \n\nthe SBET, which is complemented by some mesoporosity that can act as channels allowing \n\nthe access to the micropores.  \n\nBoth PS-KOH-0.5:1 and PS-KOH-1:1, except PS-KOH-1:1-1batch, present SBET values \n\ncomparable to the commercial AC PBFG4. Considering the ACs obtained by conventional \n\npyrolysis, the adsorbents produced at 800 \u00b0C have better textural properties than the same \n\nACs produced at 650 \u00b0C, with CPy-PS650-150KOH-1:1 and CPy-PS650-60KOH-1:1 presenting \n\na SBET of 473 m2/g and 523 m2/g, respectively (Jaria et al., 2018). Moreover, the ACs \n\nproduced at 800 \u00b0C by conventional pyrolysis present a more developed porosity and \n\nhigher SBET when compared to MW pyrolysed ACs. It is noteworthy that the textural \n\nproperties of PS-KOH-0.5:1 here produced were achieved in less time and with less \n\nactivating agent than the ACs produced by conventional pyrolysis. However, poor levels of \n\nreaction control such as lack of temperature monitorisation and non-homogeneous \n\nradiation inside the equipment, as mentioned in Section 3.1., limit the comparison with \n\nconventionally produced ACs. \n\nThe results summarised in Table 1, Section 1.3., related to ACs chemically activated \n\nby one-step MW pyrolysis, were considered for comparison purposes. Overall, PS-KOH-\n\n0.5:1 presents satisfying SBET when compared to ACs produced from giant reed (Chayid &amp; \n\nAhmed, 2015), cocoa shell (Saucier et al., 2015), cotton stalk (Deng et al., 2009) and paper \n\nmill sludge (containing PS and BS in a ratio of 1:1) (Namazi et al., 2015). However, when \n\ncompared to ACs obtained from siris seed pods (Ahmed &amp; Theydan, 2013, 2014b), lotus \n\nstalks (Huang et al., 2011) and bamboo (Liu et al., 2010), PS-KOH-0.5:1 exhibit lower SBET. \n\nThese results reinforce the cruciality of developing further work towards the optimisation \n\nof ACs production by MW pyrolysis of PS, evaluating, besides the effect of IR, the effect of \n\nMW power, radiation time and the resulting effects on the adsorption percentages of \n\nadsorbate.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nProduction of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n49 \n\n3.3. BATCH ADSORPTION TESTS \n\n3.3.1. QUANTIFICATION OF CARBAMAZEPINE BY CAPILLARY ELECTROPHORESIS \n\nThe adsorption tests were carried out for the nine produced ACs with three \n\ndifferent carbon dosages (as listed in Table 3, Section 2.4.1.) suspended in a stock solution \n\nof CBZ with a concentration of 5 mg/L.  When the adsorption tests were concluded the \n\namount of CBZ that remained in the aqueous phase was quantified by MEKC. The \n\ncorrelation coefficient of the calibration curves was above 0.995. LOD and LOQ values were \n\n0.042 and 0.129 mg/L, respectively. \n\nFigure 18 shows two electropherograms, where electropherogram (a) represents \n\nthe control test corresponding to ? 5 mg/L of CBZ, and electropherogram (b) relates an \n\nexperiment in which the amount of pharmaceutical that remained in the aqueous fraction \n\nwas relatively low.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 18.

PRELIMINARY ADSORPTION EXPERIMENTS \n\nPreliminary adsorption tests, following the description from Section 2.4.1, were \n\nperformed for non-washed ACs, for a carbon dosage of 0.1 g/L (24 h shaking at 80 rpm and \n\n25 \u00b0C). The results showed that without washing with HCl 1.2 M, the ACs were not able to \n\nremove CBZ from ultra-pure water solutions, exhibiting adsorption percentages lower than \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and discussion \n\n50 \n\n10 %. These experiments reinforce previous observations regarding the importance of the \n\nwashing procedure to unblock obstructed pores. \n\nSaucier et al. (2015) concluded similarly in the studies performed for the removal \n\nof nimesulide. The authors observed, for adsorbent dosages of 2.5 g/L, that the AC achieved \n\na removal percentage of 98.75 % when washed with an acid solution, while the \n\ncorresponding non-washed AC removed 40.25 % of pharmaceutical (contact time of 120 \n\nmin, at 25 \u00b0C for a 100 mg/L nimesulide solution). \n\nIn this sense, the adsorption experiments in the present work were carried out with \n\nthe produced ACs previously washed with a HCl solution. \n\n \n\n3.3.3. BATCH ADSORPTION TESTS WITH THE PRODUCED ACTIVATED CARBONS \n\nThe removal percentages of CBZ have a pronounced variability within ACs with the \n\nsame IR from different batches, obtained under the same experimental conditions, \n\nsimilarly to what was observed for SBET, as illustrated in Figure 19. It can be noted that the \n\nincrease of the carbon dosage from 0.025 to 0.1 g/L results in higher removal percentages \n\nof CBZ, in which 0.1 g/L is, generally, the dosage that exhibits larger removal percentages. \n\nThe variability is also reflected in the concentration of KOH, in which the adsorption \n\npercentages of CBZ decreased for ACs with higher concentration of activating agent, with \n\nPS-KOH-1.5:1 presenting less consistency and lower adsorption percentages. According to \n\nAhmed and Theydan (2013), the increase in the concentration of activating agent can lead \n\nto the micropores degradation due to an excessive widening of the pores, which is reflected \n\nin a lower adsorption efficiency. \n\nPS-KOH-0.5:1-1batch has the best CBZ removal rate, with values of 90 \u00b1 3 % and \n\n97.1 \u00b1 0.5 %, for adsorbent dosages of 0.05 and 0.1 g/L, respectively. These results are \n\nconsistent with the high SBET and well-developed porosity of this AC. According to the \n\ntextural properties of PS-KOH-0.5:1-2batch and PS-KOH-0.5:1-3batch it would be expected \n\nbetter removal performances for the latter, due to its higher SBET (875 m2/g), which is not \n\nconfirmed by the adsorption percentages, that are lower for PS-KOH-0.5:1-3batch. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nProduction of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n51 \n\n \n\nFigure 19.

Taking into account the similarities between SBET \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and discussion \n\n52 \n\nand Vp of PS-KOH-1:1-2batch (820 m2/g, 0.68 cm3/g) and PS-KOH-1:1-3batch (816 m2/g, \n\n0.63 cm3/g), it would be expected that both removed CBZ from the aqueous phase similarly, \n\nwhich is not confirmed by the adsorption percentages in which the third batch presents \n\nremarkably lower percentages than the second batch, being more pronounced for the AC \n\ndosage of 0.05 g/L.  \n\nWhen compared to the produced ACs by MW pyrolysis, ACs conventionally heated \n\nstands out with good CBZ removal uptakes (Table 7), presenting adsorption percentages \n\naround 80 % for lower AC dosages (0.015 g/L), as described in Jaria et al. (2018). The \n\nauthors performed adsorption tests in similar conditions to those applied in the present \n\nwork, however, instead of 24 h, the samples remained under overnight shaking. The ACs \n\nproduced at 800 \u00b0C have higher adsorption percentages, as it would be expected due to \n\ntheir high SBET and well-developed porous network, as summarised in Table 6 (Section \n\n3.2.2.). CPy-PS800-60KOH-1:1 is the more promising AC, since it has the same adsorption \n\npercentage for lower energy consumption, hence lower costs. In addition, the use of lower \n\nAC dosages to achieve analogous outcomes for the removal of CBZ from water raises the \n\nadsorbent interest for being cost-efficient.  \n\n \n\nTable 7. CBZ adsorption percentages for ACs produced by conventional pyrolysis. Adsorption tests performed \nby Jaria et al. (2018) (5 mg/L CBZ solution, AC dosage of 0.015 g/L, overnight shaking at 80 rpm and 25 \u00b0C)  \n\nAC Adsorption (%) CBZ \n\nCPy-PS800-150KOH-1:1 81 \u00b1 3 \n\nCPy-PS800-60KOH-1:1 81 \u00b1 1 \n\nCPy-PS650-150KOH-1:1 8.8 \u00b1 0.1 \n\nCPy-PS650-60KOH-1:1 6 \u00b1 1 \n\nPBFG4 18 \u00b1 5 \n\n \n\nThe commercial AC (PBFG4) used as reference presents lower adsorption \n\npercentages when compared to the ACs produced conventionally and those produced in \n\nthe scope of this work. However, one should consider that PBFG4 uptakes were achieved \n\nfor AC dosages of 0.015 g/L, which is almost two times inferior than the smaller AC dosage \n\nused in this work (0.025 g/L). Even though, considering the well-developed microporous \n\n\n\nProduction of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n53 \n\nstructure of the produced ACs, it would be expected better CBZ removal percentages for \n\nPS-KOH-0.5:1 when compared to PBFG4, considering that the tests would be performed \n\nunder the same experimental conditions. \n\nAs mentioned in Section 2.4.1., the use of small masses of AC to perform the \n\nadsorption tests could be an influencing factor in the CBZ uptake percentages, in the sense \n\nthat the effect of any small variation, such as adhesion of the adsorbent onto the tubes \n\nwalls/lid, will be more evident when using low masses of AC than would be for higher \n\nmasses. Therefore, and maintaining the same final AC dosage, batch adsorption tests were \n\nperformed weighing 2 mg and 3 mg of AC as summarised in Table 4 (Section 2.4.1.). Since \n\none of the raised doubts was related to the heterogeneity between batches obtained under \n\nthe same experimental conditions, the tests were performed for PS-KOH-0.5:1-2batch, PS-\n\nKOH-0.5:1-3batch, PS-KOH-1:1-2batch and PS-KOH-1:1-3batch. The amount of AC was \n\nlimited due to the low production yields, as shown in Figure 15 (Section 3.1.), which \n\nresulted in masses of AC that could vary between 140 and 300 mg, needed for physico-\n\nchemical characterisation of the ACs and adsorption tests. The small amount of AC \n\nproduced for each batch conditioned the number of experiments that could be performed, \n\nwhich also explains why the experiment with 3 mg was carried out for only two ACs from \n\nthe third batch. \n\nThe CBZ adsorption percentages are more consistent within ACs with the same IR \n\nfrom different batches when the AC dosage is achieved with masses of AC higher than 1 \n\nmg, as shown in Figure 20. By weighing 2 mg of AC for a dosage of 0.05 g/L, PS-KOH-0.5:1-\n\n2batch removes 68 \u00b1 4 % of CBZ from ultra-pure water solution, and analogously, the \n\ncorresponding AC from the third batch removes 65 \u00b1 13 %. Similar observations can be \n\nmade for a dosage of 0.1 g/L in which 2 mg of AC was weighed, with PS-KOH-0.5:1-2batch \n\nand PS-KOH-0.5:1-3batch presenting comparable adsorptions of 82 \u00b1 5 % and 92 \u00b1 6 %, \n\nrespectively. For PS-KOH-1:1 the adsorption percentages vary more pronouncedly between \n\nPS-KOH-1:1-2batch and PS-KOH-1:1-3batch, even when 2 mg of AC were weighed, whose \n\nresults are not consistent with the SBET values. As already mentioned, it would be expected \n\nto have similar CBZ removal percentages for the two batches of PS-KOH-1:1, with surface \n\nareas of 820 and 816 m2/g. \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and discussion \n\n54 \n\n \n\nFigure 20. Evaluation of the effect of the mass of AC weighed on the CBZ adsorption percentages for a \ncontact time of 24 h \n\n \n\nIt can be noted that for PS-KOH-0.5:1-2batch and PS-KOH-1:1-2batch, for both AC \n\ndosages of 0.05 and 0.1 g/L, the increase of the AC mass from 1 to 2 mg results in lower \n\nCBZ removal percentages. The opposite trend is observed for the two ACs from the third \n\nbatch, for both AC dosages of 0.05 and 0.1 g/L, in which the increase of the AC mass from \n\n1 to 2 mg results in higher percentages of CBZ removed. The experiments in which 3 mg of \n\nAC was weighed, demonstrate that the adsorption percentages do not vary significantly \n\neither by weighing 2 or 3 mg of AC, for a dosage of 0.1 g/L. With that being said, for a dosage \n\nof 0.1 g/L, PS-KOH-0.5:1-3batch is able to remove CBZ from aqueous solution with a \n\npercentage of 92 \u00b1 6 % and 91 \u00b1 7 %, for a mass of AC of 2 and 3 mg, respectively. \n\n\n\nProduction of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n55 \n\nAnalogously, PS-KOH-1:1-3batch has removal percentages of 94 \u00b1 2 % and 90 \u00b1 4 %, for an \n\nAC mass of 2 and 3 mg, respectively. With these results, one observes that the \n\npharmaceutical uptake does not differs significantly for the same AC dosage obtained by \n\nweighing masses of 2 and 3 mg, which means that there should be homogeneity within ACs \n\nfrom the same batch. The amount of AC available did not allowed the experiments with 3 \n\nmg of AC for PS-KOH-1:1-2batch, which would be helpful to demonstrate whether or not \n\nthere was homogeneity between the two batches of PS-KOH-1:1 with similar textural \n\nproperties. \n\nTheoretically the same removal percentage should be achieved regardless of the \n\nmass of AC weighed for a specific dosage of AC in suspension, which in practice is not \n\nobserved. It seems that increasing the amount of AC, for instance, by performing the \n\nexperiments for AC dosages of 0.1 g/L, weighing masses of 2 or 3 mg, might increase the \n\nreliability of the obtained results, improving the repeatability of the experiments within the \n\nbatches. Taking into account ACs produced by MW pyrolysis, available literature has shown \n\nthat, overall, batch adsorption experiments are performed for AC dosages above 0.1 g/L. \n\nNevertheless, the adsorbate concentrations are also significantly higher than the initial \n\nconcentration considered in this work (5 mg/L). Some examples include Saucier et al. \n\n(2015) that used an AC dosage of 2.5 g/L, that is, 50 mg of adsorbent per 20 mL of 100 mg/L \n\npharmaceutical solution. Also Ahmed and Theydan (2014a) performed tests to assess the \n\neffect of the AC dosage on the adsorption percentage. For a 20 mg/L stock solution of \n\nciprofloxacin, the authors observed an increase of the removal rate, from 79.94 % to 96.12 \n\n% when the AC dosage was increased from 0.25 to 0.75 g/L (5 mg of AC per 20 mL of \n\npharmaceutical solution and 15 mg of AC per 20 mL of pharmaceutical solution, \n\nrespectively) (Ahmed &amp; Theydan, 2014a). One observes that the adsorption experiments \n\nwere performed with relatively high dosages of AC, implying the use of higher masses of \n\nAC when compared to the masses of adsorbent used in the present work, and therefore, if \n\neffects such as AC adhesion onto the walls of the vessels occurred, they would be \n\nimperceptible. \n\nOverall, the obtained results also show that different production batches resulted \n\nin ACs with different properties and performances, that ideally should present identical \n\nhttps://www.linguee.pt/ingles-portugues/traducao/theoretically.html\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and discussion \n\n56 \n\nfeatures since they were produced under the same conditions. As far as it is known, the \n\nrepeatability of the production process of ACs by MW pyrolysis is not discussed in \n\nliterature. This subject should gain more focus given that, generally, the production process \n\nis limited to small amounts of slurry (or dried impregnated precursor), as mentioned in \n\nSection 3.1., which in addition to relatively low product yields may restrict physico-chemical \n\ncharacterisation and adsorption experiments, including removal percentages, kinetic and \n\nequilibrium studies. \n\n \n\n3.3.4. EVALUATION OF THE EFFECT OF CONTACT TIME \n\nBeside the possible effect of the mass of AC used, it was also hypothesised if the \n\ncontact time between adsorbent/pharmaceutical (24 h) was enough to guarantee that the \n\nadsorbate could access the micropores of the produced ACs. In order to complement the \n\nalready obtained results for 24 h, tests were carried out for PS-KOH-0.5:1-2batch and PS-\n\nKOH-0.5:1-3batch for contact times of 49 and 72 h, by using 1 and 2 mg of AC for both AC \n\ndosages of 0.05 and 0.1 g/L. Results demonstrate that for both ACs, regardless of the \n\nadsorbent dosage, the percentage of CBZ adsorbed onto the AC decreased over time, as \n\ndemonstrated in Figure 21 and Figure 22. \n\nIt would be expected to observe a behaviour similar to the one described in Figure \n\n3 (Section 1.2.1.), in which the amount of CBZ adsorbed onto the AC would increase over \n\ntime, until an equilibrium was attained. Even without reaching a plateau it was expected to \n\nobserve an increase of the percentage of adsorption and not the other way around. \n\nAlthough the process of adsorption is an equilibrium between adsorbent and adsorbate in \n\nwhich there is, naturally, adsorption and desorption, the desorption of the pharmaceutical \n\ndoes not seem to explain the results obtained, at least not so pronouncedly.  \n\n \n\n\n\nProduction of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n57 \n\n \n\nFigure 21. Evaluation of the effect of contact time between CBZ and AC on the adsorption percentages, for \nAC dosages of 0.05 g/L and 0.1 g/L \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 22. Evaluation of the effect of contact time between CBZ and AC on the adsorption percentages, for \nAC dosages of 0.05 g/L and 0.1 g/L \n\n \n\nIt seems that the increase of the contact time in addition to the possible effect of \n\nAC adhesion onto the walls/lids of the tubes (Figure 23), may be related to the decrease of \n\nthe percentages of CBZ removed from aqueous solution. Probably, this effect may increase \n\nover time, resulting in the reduction of the amount of adsorbent available to retain CBZ. \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and discussion \n\n58 \n\nWith the tubes in constant shaking, it seems unlikely that some particles of AC could also \n\nbe aggregate to each other, nevertheless it is a possibility that also need to be considered.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 23. Conclusion of adsorption tests: (a) Appearance of a suspension after the experiment; (b) AC \nadhesion to the walls/lid of the tube \n\n \n\nFigure 24 illustrates the appearance of the suspensions after 72 h shaking at \n\ncontrolled temperature for a) PS-KOH-0.5:1-2batch and b) PS-KOH-0.5:1-3batch. The \n\ndifference in the appearance of the ACs suspensions reinforce that, regardless of the \n\ncommon production conditions, the two adsorbents present different characteristics. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 24. Adsorption tests after 72 h shaking for: (a) PS-KOH-0.5:1-2batch; (b) PS-KOH-0.5:1-3batch \n\n \n\n\n\nProduction of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n59 \n\nOverall, the adsorption percentages are lower for the experiments in which 1 mg of \n\nAC was used instead of 2 mg, for the same final dosage. The removal percentages are also \n\nlower for the adsorbent dosage of 0.05 g/L when compared to 0.1 g/L, evidencing that the \n\nreduced pharmaceutical uptake could be linked to the reduction of the amount of AC and \n\ntherefore, reduction of adsorption active sites. Moreover, one highlights that PS-KOH-\n\n0.5:1-3batch presents higher removal percentages than PS-KOH-0.5:1-2batch, which is in \n\nagreement with the better textural properties of the latter, with a SBET and Vp of 875 m2/g \n\nand 0.68 cm3/g, respectively. \n\nStudies found in literature, usually do not use contact times as long as 72 h, being \n\ncommonly up to 24 h. Typically, several contact times are evaluated and the adsorption of \n\npharmaceuticals onto the ACs tend to increase over time until the equilibrium is reached \n\n(Ahmed &amp; Theydan, 2014a; Chayid &amp; Ahmed, 2015; Huang et al., 2011). In order to \n\nunderstand the reason why the removal percentages of CBZ decreased over time, it would \n\nbe relevant to test more contact times, which was not accomplished due to the insufficient \n\namount of ACs.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and discussion \n\n60 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n61 \n\nCHAPTER 4: CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Conclusions and future developments \n\n62 \n\n\n\nProduction of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n63 \n\nThis work aimed to produce ACs using solid wastes from paper mill industry, namely \n\nPS, through non-conventional pyrolysis. Three MW pyrolysed ACs were produced in \n\ntriplicate by changing the activating agent:precursor IR, from which nine ACs resulted. The \n\nproduced adsorbents were physico-chemically characterised by determining TOC, SBET and \n\nVp. In addition, the produced ACs were subjected to batch adsorption tests in order to \n\nassess their efficiency to remove CBZ from ultra-pure water solutions. The global \n\nappreciations were as follow: \n\n \n\n- The experimental results have shown that within the same IR, the produced ACs \n\npresented different properties and removal performances, evidencing that the \n\nproduction process needed to be enhanced in order to make it repeatable. The \n\nlack of repeatability could be related to the poor levels of reaction control such \n\nas difficulty to guarantee the uniformity of MW radiation inside the modified \n\ndomestic MW. Moreover, it could be related to an incomplete carbonisation, \n\nrequiring the process optimisation by defining the optimal MW power, radiation \n\ntime, chemical agent and IR. Considering the exploratory nature of this work \n\nand the limited timeline, the IR was the only production parameter tested. \n\n \n\n- Overall, the ACs were characterised by a porous structure more developed than \n\nthe commercial AC (PBFG4) used as reference. The ACs that presented better \n\nSBET (on average 946 m2/g), were those with lower concentrations of activating \n\nagent, PS-KOH-0.5:1, being a satisfactory feature in the economic point of view. \n\n \n\n- According to the removal percentages of CBZ from ultra-pure water solutions, \n\nit was shown that higher uptakes were achieved when the adsorption \n\nexperiments were performed with PS-KOH-0.5:1, for an AC dosage of 0.1 g/L \n\n(weighing 2 or 3 mg of AC) and a contact time of 24 h. Under these experimental \n\nconditions, removal efficiencies above 80 % were observed. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Conclusions and future developments \n\n64 \n\nThe produced ACs had appreciable textural properties at an early and pioneering \n\nstage with regard to the type of precursor and heating methodology. Therefore, some \n\nfuture developments could include: \n\n \n\n- In a first stage, studies should be made in order to guarantee the repeatability \n\nof the production process.  \n\n \n\n- Besides the effect of the IR, other operational parameters should be tested, \n\nincluding the effect that other activating agents such as K2CO3 and H3PO4, MW \n\npower and radiation time could have on the final AC and how it would be \n\nreflected in the pharmaceutical removal efficiencies.  \n\n \n\n- Physico-chemical characterisation (beside TOC, SBET and Vp), kinetic adsorption \n\nstudies and adsorption equilibrium studies should be performed. \n\n \n\n- Considering the difficulty to guarantee the homogeneous slurry packaging into \n\nthe quartz reactor, experiments could be performed in parallel by using the \n\ndried impregnated precursor. \n\n \n\n- Other classes and mixtures of pharmaceuticals could be assessed and tests \n\ncould also be carried out for spiked WWTP effluents. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n65 \n\nCHAPTER 5: REFERENCES \n\n\n\nChapter 5: References \n\n66 \n\n\n\nProduction of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n \n\n67 \n\nAdhikari, G., &amp; Bhattacharyya, K.
