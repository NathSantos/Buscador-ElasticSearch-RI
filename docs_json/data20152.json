Diversos pat\u00f3genos virais \n\nforam identificados nestes surtos, incluindo norov\u00edrus (NV), v\u00edrus das \n\nhepatites A e E (HAV e HEV, respectivamente), astrov\u00edrus (AstV), \n\npoliov\u00edrus (PV), poliomav\u00edrus (PyV), adenov\u00edrus (AdV) e rotav\u00edrus \n\n(RV). Padr\u00f5es de qualidade da \u00e1gua, tanto para consumo quanto para \nrecrea\u00e7\u00e3o, ainda se referem aos coliformes totais e termotolerantes e \n\nesse fato tem sido cada vez mais questionado pela comunidade cient\u00edfica \n\ne autoridades sanit\u00e1rias no mundo todo.  \n\nEste estudo teve como objetivo avaliar o n\u00edvel de contamina\u00e7\u00e3o por \n\nv\u00edrus em amostras de \u00e1gua e sedimento coletadas em duas regi\u00f5es da \n\nilha de Florian\u00f3polis em Santa Catarina, sul do Brasil: Rio Sangradouro \n\n(amostras de \u00e1gua de superf\u00edcie e sedimento) e Lagoa do Peri (\u00e1gua de \n\nsuperf\u00edcie, distintas profundidades de coluna de \u00e1gua- 0.9, 5.5 e 8.0 \n\nmetros e sedimentos). Os v\u00edrus avaliados foram: adenov\u00edrus humano \n\n(HAdV), v\u00edrus da hepatite A (HAV), rotav\u00edrus grupo A (RVA), e \n\ncolifagos som\u00e1ticos. Para mimetizar a influ\u00eancia da radia\u00e7\u00e3o solar na \n\nestabilidade dos v\u00edrus montou-se um microcosmo em condi\u00e7\u00f5es naturais \n\nde claro/escuro (dia e noite) e totalmente no escuro ambos em escala \n\nlaboratorial e utilizamos  AdV recombinante (rAdV) e norovirus murino \n\n(MNV-1) como modelos de v\u00edrus de genoma DNA e RNA (Cap\u00edtulo III \n\nda tese). Os ensaios envolveram t\u00e9cnicas moleculares de PCR em tempo \n\nreal (HAdV, HAV, RVA) para quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o de genomas e t\u00e9cnicas de \n\ninfec\u00e7\u00e3o  celular in vitro (HAdV, rHAdV e MNV-1), al\u00e9m de t\u00e9cnicas \n\nmicrobiol\u00f3gicas cl\u00e1ssicas (colifagos) para estudos de infecciosidade \n\nviral . Cap\u00edtulo I: No ano de 2013 foram coletadas e analisadas um total \n\nde 96 amostras de \u00e1gua e sedimento. Para as amostras de \u00e1gua, HAdV \n\nfoi detectado em 70,8% das amostras de ver\u00e3o, sendo que 82,4% dessas \n\ncontinham v\u00edrus infecciosos; a frequ\u00eancia do HAdV no inverno foi de \n\n62,5% e nenhum deles continham v\u00edrus infecciosos. Para as amostras de \n\nsedimento, a frequ\u00eancia de HAdV foi de 37,5% nas amostras de ver\u00e3o, \n\ncom 66,7% desses contendo HAdV infeccioso; a frequ\u00eancia HAdV no \n\ninverno foi de 37,5%, e nenhuma amostra continha v\u00edrus infecciosos. \n\nRVA foram detectados em 20,8 e 45,8% das amostras de \u00e1guas \n\nsuperficiais coletadas no ver\u00e3o e inverno, respectivamente, e em 8,3 e \n\n12,5% das amostras de sedimentos coletados no ver\u00e3o e inverno, \n\nrespectivamente. Genomas de HAV foram detectados apenas em \u00e1guas \n\nde superf\u00edcie, com 54,8 e 12,5% de positividade em amostras de ver\u00e3o e \n\ninverno, respectivamente. Cap\u00edtulo II: No ano de 2014 foi avaliada a \n\n\n\ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o espacial de v\u00edrus em diferentes profundidades da coluna de \n\n\u00e1gua bem como sedimento. Um total de 84 amostras de \u00e1gua e 48 \n\namostras de sedimentos foi analisado. Foi observado que, 64% e 48% \n\ndas amostras de \u00e1gua e sedimento foram positivas para HAdV, \n\nrespectivamente, sendo que 76% e 83% dos amostras respectivamente, \n\ncontinham v\u00edrus infecciosos. RVA estava presente em 33% e 18,75% \n\ndas amostras de \u00e1gua e sedimento respectivamente e 25% das amostras \n\nde \u00e1gua foram positivas para HAV. Colifagos som\u00e1ticos puderam ser \n\ndetectados em 42% e 18,75% das amostras de \u00e1gua e sedimento, \n\nrespectivamente. Os dados apontaram para uma varia\u00e7\u00e3o de preval\u00eancia \n\nv\u00edrus de acordo com as diferentes profundidades da coluna de \u00e1gua. \n\nCap\u00edtulo III: As taxas de decaimento (K) e T90 para rHAdV e MNV-1 \n\nna \u00e1gua e sedimentos foram calculadas usando um microcosmo em \n\nescala de laborat\u00f3rio. Foram calculadas as unidades infecciosas de \n\nrHAdV e MNV-1 por microscopia de fluoresc\u00eancia e ensaio de placa de \n\nlise, respectivamente ao longo de um per\u00edodo de 85 dias. O curso do \n\ndecaimento natural de rHAdV e MNV-1 foi similar sob luz solar natural \n\nnos microcosmos  onde o T90 para rHAdV foi de 7,7 e 7 dias em \u00e1gua e \n\nsedimentos, respectivamente. O T90 para MNV-1 foi de 6,7 e 6,4 dias na \n\n\u00e1gua e sedimento, respectivamente. Nos microcosmos mantidos \n\ncompletamente no escuro observou-se uma estabilidade maior tanto para \n\no rHAdV em \u00e1gua (T90 = 20,9 dias), quanto em sedimentos (T90 = 22 \n\ndias) sendo que para MNV-1 a estabilidade foi T90 = 12 dias e T90 = 18 \n\ndias em \u00e1gua e em sedimento, respectivamente. Estes resultados \n\ndemonstraram a presen\u00e7a dos v\u00edrus ent\u00e9ricos potenciais causadores de \n\ndoen\u00e7as no principal manancial de \u00e1gua doce da Ilha de Santa Catarina e \n\nno Rio que corta muitos bairros dessa regi\u00e3o e desemboca na Praia do \n\nMatadeiro, muito frequentada por banhistas e surfistas durante todo o \n\nano e tamb\u00e9m a adsor\u00e7\u00e3o e estabilidade dos v\u00edrus aos sedimentos que \n\ns\u00e3o ressuspendidos pela a\u00e7\u00e3o dos ventos e chuvas, voltando \u00e0s colunas \n\nde \u00e1gua. Esperemos que, no futuro, essas \u00e1reas sejam mais protegidas \n\npelas autoridades e que a popula\u00e7\u00e3o se conscientize de seu papel na \n\nprote\u00e7\u00e3o dos recursos h\u00eddricos, fundamentais \u00e0 manuten\u00e7\u00e3o da vida no \n\nplaneta terra. \nPalavras-chave: v\u00edrus ent\u00e9ricos, microcosmo, sedimento, colifagos \n\nsom\u00e1ticos, estabilidade viral, \u00e1gua de superf\u00edcie, profundidade da coluna \n\nde \u00e1gua. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\nThe presence of enteric viruses in the environment (water, soil) and in \n\nfoods is well documented and has been associated with several \n\ngastroenteritis outbreaks of non-bacterial origin. Several viral pathogens \n\nwere identified in these outbreaks, including Norovirus (NV), hepatitis \n\nA and E viruses (HAV and HEV respectively), astrovirus (AstV), \n\npoliovirus (PV), polyomavirus (PyV), adenovirus (AdV) and rotavirus \n\n(RV). Water quality standards, both for consumption and for recreation, \n\nstill refer to the total and fecal coliforms and this fact has been \n\nincreasingly questioned by the scientific community and health \n\nauthorities worldwide.  \n\nThis study aimed to assess the level of viral contamination in water and \n\nsediment samples collected from two regions: Rio Sangradouro (surface \n\nwater and sediment samples) and Peri Lagoon, representing the main \n\nfreshwater reservoir of the island of Florianopolis in Santa Catarina, \n\nsouthern Brazil, (surface water, different depths of water-column: 0.9, \n\n5.5 and 8.0 meters and sediment). Evaluated virus were: human \n\nadenovirus (HAdV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), rotavirus group A (RVA), \n\nand somatic coliphages (Chapters I and II of this thesis). To mimic the \n\ninfluence of solar radiation on the stability of the virus it was set up a \n\nmicrocosm in natural conditions of light/dark (day and night) and totally \n\nin the dark both at laboratory scale and used recombinant AdV (rAdV) \n\nand murine norovirus (MNV -1) as models for DNA and RNA genome \n\nviruses (Chapter III of this thesis). The assays involved molecular PCR \n\ntechniques in real time (HAdV, HAV, RVA) for quantification of \n\ngenomes and cell culture techniques in vitro (HAdV, rHAdV and MNV-\n1) in addition to classical microbiological techniques (coliphages) for \n\nstudies of viral infectivity. Chapter I: We collected a total of 96 \n\nsamples of water and sediment during the summer and winter of 2013. \n\nFor water samples, HAdV was detected in 70.8% of the summer \n\nsamples, 82.4% of those with infectious virus; the incidence of HAdV in \n\nwinter was 62.5% and none were infectious. For sediment samples, the \n\nincidence of HAdV was 37.5% in the summer samples, with 66.7% \n\ncontaining infectious HAdV; the incidence HAdV in winter was 37.5% \n\nand none were infectious. Genomes of RVA were detected in 20.8 and \n\n45.8% of surface water samples collected in summer and winter, \n\nrespectively, and 8.3 and 12.5% of the samples of sediment collected in \n\nsummer and winter, respectively. Genomes of HAV were detected only \n\nin surface waters, with 54.8 and 12.5% positivity in summer and winter \n\nsamples, respectively. Chapter II: The spatial distribution of the \n\n\n\nevaluated viruses in different depths of the water column was evaluated. \n\nA total of 84 samples of water and 48 samples of sediment were \n\nanalyzed. After analysis, 64% and 48% of water and sediment samples \n\nwere positive for HAdV, respectively 76% and 83% respectively \n\ninfectious. RVA was present in 33% and 18.75% of the samples of \n\nwater and sediment respectively and 25% of water samples were \n\npositive for HAV. Somatic coliphages could be detected in 42% and \n\n18.75% of water and sediment samples, respectively. The data indicated \n\na variation in the virus prevalence according to the different depths of \n\nthe water column. Chapter III: The decay rates (K) and T90 were \n\ncalculated for rHAdV and MNV-1 in water and sediments using a \n\nmicrocosm in a laboratory scale. The infectivity was measured by \n\ninfectious units of rHAdV and MNV-1 by fluorescence microscopy and \n\nplaque assay, respectively, over a period of 85 days. The course of \n\nnatural decay of rHAdV and MNV-1 was similar under natural \n\ncondition in microcosms where T90 to rAdV was 7.7 and 7 days in water \n\nand sediment, respectively. The T90 in NVM-1 was 6.7 and 6.4 days in \n\nthe water and sediment respectively. In microcosms completely in the \n\ndark condition it was observed an increased stability for rHAdV in water \n\n(T90 = 20.9 days) and in sediment (T90 = 22 days) as well as for MNV-1 \n\nwith T90 = 12 days and T90 = 18 days in water and sediment \n\nrespectively. These results demonstrate the real presence of enteric \n\nviruses which cause diseases, in the main fresh water source of the \n\nisland of Santa Catarina and the Sangradouro River that crosses many \n\ndistricts of this region and flow into Matadeiro Beach, which is used by \n\nswimmers and surfers throughout the year. Also we realize the \n\nadsorption and stability of the viruses to the sediments that are \n\nsubsequently resuspended by wind and rain, returning to the water \n\ncolumns.

PRESENTATION \n\nThis section will provide a brief literature review regarding the \n\nsubject of this thesis. \n\n \n\n1.1 WATER QUALITY IN BRAZIL \nAccording to a report released on the occasion of the World Water \n\nForum in Mexico, 2006, 57 million of the 6 billion people in the world \n\nlack safe drinking water. Brazil is one of the richest countries in the \n\nworld in water resources, with about 13% of all fresh water in the \n\nplanet. However today, the water distribution in Brazil meets more to \n\nagro-business interests than the people's needs. According to the \n\nBrazilian National Water Agency (AG\u00caNCIA NACIONAL DAS \n\n\u00c1GUAS-ANA) which is responsible for the National Water Resources \n\nPolicy and creates the National System for Water Resources \n\nManagement, the biggest water consumer in the country is the agro-\n\nbusiness (72%), which has targeted production to export soybeans, beef \n\nand pork. For example, only in 2013, agro-business spent 200 trillion \n\nliters of water, equivalent to 200 full container systems. This is followed \n\nby industries with 22% while the household represent only 6% of water \n\nconsumption in the country (AG\u00caNCIA NACIONAL DAS \u00c1GUAS-\n\nANA, 2014) \n\nAccording to ANA Brazilian Federal Law 9.433, from January 8, \n\n1997, the term of water sources refers to surface water, underground \n\nwater, flooding, or potentially usable waters for the public water supply, \n\nand the priority use is for human consumption and for animals drinking; \n\nWater resources management should always assure the multiple uses of \n\nwater and the management of water resources should be decentralized \n\nand include the participation of public authorities, users and \n\ncommunities. \n\nHowever, the water sources have been challenged with \n\nanthropogenic influences, and the pollution can be caused both by \n\nnatural sources and humans, mainly through discharge of human, animal \n\nand industrial wastes. As this contaminated water can be reused in the \n\nfield of agriculture uses such as irrigation, this can lead to degradation \n\nof food, soil quality and also will affect the quality of ground water \n\n(TUCCI et al., 2001). The non-collected and the collected but non-\n\ntreated sewage are disposed in soils and water bodies, producing \n\npollution. The sewage is the major cause of water pollution in Brazil. \n\n\n\n34 \n\nFor these reasons, sanitation and hygiene facilities are considered one of \n\nthe most important concerns all over Brazil, to prevent or even reduce \n\nthe risks of diseases related to release these contaminants into the \n\naquatic environment (IBGE, 2008). Although, wastewater treatment \n\nprocesses are considered the most unsafe service in Brazil (IBGE, \n\n2010). \n\nAccording to the latest estimates of the WHO/UNICEF Joint \n\nMonitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP), 32% of the \n\nworld\u2019s population \u2013 2.4 billion people \u2013 lacked improved sanitation \n\nfacilities, and 663 million people still use improper drinking water \n\nsources, in 2015 the vast majority living in India, China and Africa. As a \n\nresult of inadequate access to safe water and sanitation services, 2.2 \n\nmillion deaths annual (mostly children under the age of 5) occur because \n\nof sanitation-related diseases and poor hygienic conditions (WHO; \n\nUNICEF, 2009 &amp; 2015).  \n\nIn Brazil, according to the National Survey of Improved Sanitation, \n\nknown by the acronym PNSB there is a variable frequency survey \n\naccording to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). \n\nOnly 55.16% of the Brazilian municipalities have sewage collection \n\nnetwork for services and, regarding Santa Catarina state, only 28.5% of \n\nthe population have sewage treatment services (IBGE, 2008) as shown \n\nin Fig. 1.  \n\n \nFigure 1. Proportion of districts with wastewater treatment, according to \n\nBrazilian state and hydrographic basins. Brazil, 2000 (IBGE, 2008). \n\n \n\n \nSource: Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat\u00edstica \n\n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nCurrently the city of Florian\u00f3polis, Santa Catarina state, regarding \n\nthe collection and treatment of sewage system, covers a total of 44% of \n\nthe resident population (PLANO MUNICIPAL INTEGRADO DE \n\nSANEAMENTO B\u00c1SICO \u2013 PMISB, 2008). This means that 56% of the \n\nresident populations are exhibited to the risk of water related diseases \n\nbecause of the possible route of aquatic system contamination by \n\nsewage disposal. In 1997 a real system of Wastewater Treatment Plant \n\n(WWTP) located in the south of the island, established by CASAN-\n\nCatarinense Company for Water and Sanitation (CASAN, 2011). \n\nCASAN is a mixed capital company, established in 1970 by the State \n\nLaw No. 4547 and incorporated on July 2, 1971, whose mission is to \n\nprovide clean water collection and treatment of sewage. The company is \n\npresent in 201 municipalities of Santa Catarina. Currently the services \n\nprovided by CASAN cover almost the entire state of Santa Catarina, \n\ndisposing of three water treatment plant (WTP) system called North, \n\nSouth and East Coast, Integrated in Florian\u00f3polis (PMISB, 2008). \n\nCASAN serves a population of 2.5 million people with treated water \n\nsupply and 319,000 with sewage collection. Surface and ground water \n\nare used by CASAN as sources for water, treatment and distribution to \n\nthe population. The water treatment process consists of: clarification \n\n(coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation and filtration), final treatment \n\n(disinfection, fluoridation and pH correction), reservation and \n\ndistribution. In relation to sewage treatment consist of storage in \n\nStabilization Ponds, Activated Sludge (oxidation, aeration) and \n\nBiological filters (CASAN 2011). \n\nQuality and safety of water bodies in Brazil classified for human \n\nuses, according to Brazilian regulation, (THE NATIONAL \n\nENVIRONMENT COUNCIL-CONAMA 2000) are evaluated according \n\nto bacteriological parameters which analyse only total and fecal \n\ncoliforms (E. coli) as indicators for faecal contamination, which is \n\nrequired by Brazilian legislation (Portaria/MS 2.914/2011). However, \n\nthere is no relationship between bacteria presence and other pathogens \n\nsuch as protozoa and virus detection because these last pathogens are \n\nmore resistant to the most conventional treatment step either in water or \n\nwastewater treatment systems (FONG; LIPP, 2005). For these reasons, \n\nthe Brazilian Association of Sanitary Engineering, known by the \n\nPortuguese-language acronym ABES (ASSOCIA\u00c7\u00c3O BRASILEIRA \n\nDE ENGENHARIA SANIT\u00c1RIA), suggested to include other \n\nmicroorganisms in the evaluation of water quality, including waterborne \n\nhuman viruses (ABES, 2010). \n\n\n\n36 \n\nContamination of coastal and estuarine waters by faecal pollution \n\ncan lead to serious human health risks. According to the World Health \n\nOrganization, about 1.8 million deaths from diarrhea occur each year; \n\nlargely caused by unsafe water consumption (WHO, 2013). Coastal \n\nlagoons occupy around 13% of the coastal areas worldwide (KJERVE, \n\n1994). These ecosystems are considered social, ecological and \n\neconomically important due to their intensive use by humans and \n\nanimals as water resources, sanitation tools and areas for swimming and \n\nrecreation (SPAULDING 1994). Unfortunately, Brazilian coastal \n\nlagoons are subjected to several types of anthropogenic uses and \n\ninfluences due to population pressure (HENNEMANN; PETRUCIO \n\n2011).  \n\nThe lack of adequate sanitation in these ecosystems in coastal areas \n\nis a problem since in Brazil, one third of the population inhabits these \n\nregions (MINIST\u00c9RIO DO MEIO AMBIENTE-MMA, 2007). As \n\ncoastal communities grow, sewage can become a threat to local \n\nwaterways: demand often exceeds available sewage treatment, and \n\nmuch of the sewage is dumped without being treated. Bathing in or \n\ningesting sewage-contaminated water can cause infections and transmit \n\ndiseases. \n\nSediments have their own hidden community of tiny inert and living \n\ncomponents such as roots of living plants as well as populations of \n\nmicroorganisms and animals (VORONEY, 2007). Sediment covers \n\nmore than 2-3 times of the earth\u2019s surface. There are two basic origins of \n\nthe particles composing marine sediment 1) created in situ from the \n\ndissolved components, 2) carried by the water body through land or \n\natmosphere. \n\nThe sediment is the result of soil erosion, and it was suggested to act \n\nas reservoir of pathogens from which can be released again into the \n\nwater column as a result of natural or artificial phenomenon (ALM et al. \n\n2003). Due to the high capabilities adsorption and accumulation \n\nphenomenon, their concentrations become several orders of magnitude \n\ngreater than the corresponding overlaying water column. \n\nSediments are considered the only refuge for solid-associated viruses \n\nfrom the water column to settle in at the water\u2019s bottom, which may \n\nenhance the survival of these pathogens by reducing exposure to various \n\nstressors such as sunlight; it has been proven that viral abundance in the \n\nsediment exceeds that in the water column by an order of magnitude \n\n(DANOVARO et al., 1999; DANOVARO; SERRESI 2000; \n\nDANOVARO et al., 2002; DANOVARO; MIDDELBOE, 2010). \n\nParticles shed in fecal material in soil at low temperatures or in sediment \n\n\n\n37 \n\nunderwater will survive the longest and may be detectable for months or \n\nyears (PERCIVAL et al., 2004). Recent studies suggested that sediment \n\nplays an important role in pathogen contamination by acting as a \n\nreservoir from which these pathogens can be re-released into the water \n\ncolumn as a result of natural or artificial phenomena such as wind or \n\nswimming activity (SMITH et al., 1978; SCHAIBERGER et al., 1982; \n\nBOSCH, 1998; TOZE, 1999; SUBEKTI et al., 2002; ALM et al., 2003; \n\nSEARCY et al., 2006; SALVO; FABIANO, 2007). \n\n \n\n1.2 Enteric viruses \n\nThe presence of pathogenic microorganisms in water generally \n\nresults from pollution from human and animal faeces, from urban and \n\nrural wastewater (GONZALEZ et al., 1982). Whereas most waterborne \n\npathogens have in common their origin in the faeces of sick individuals, \n\na condition for assessing the microbiological quality of the water is the \n\nexamination of indicators of faecal contamination (AMARAL et al., \n\n2003). The most common microorganisms used as indicators are thermo \n\ntolerant coliforms, Escherichia coli and enterococci (ORTEGA et al., \n\n2009). Unfortunately as we mentioned before, these bacteria cannot \n\nalways be related to the presence of the virus, because they are also \n\nmore persistent and stable than bacteria (PINA et al., 1998; LEES, \n\n2000). \n\nEnteric viruses enter into the environment by the wastes excreted by \n\ninfected humans and animals. The aquatic ecosystem may also be \n\ncontaminated as a result of sewage discharge or run-off from agriculture \n\nactivities. (FONG; LIPP, 2005). Once introduced into coastal waters, \n\nthey can easily absorb to solid particles, thereby protecting themselves \n\nfrom inactivating factors and may result in unpredictable resuspension \n\nto water column again due to natural or artificial sediment disruption \n\n(GERBA et al., 1977; SOBSEY et al., 1980). \n\nThe contamination of surface water by enteric viruses is one of the \n\nmajor public health concerns in relation to water resources used for \n\ndrinking due to the health risks caused by these viruses. The destiny of \n\nthese pathogens in the aquatic environment is controlled by sorption-\n\ndesorption processes after they are being released to surface water \n\n(WONG et al., 2012 &amp; 2013). Due to their size, these suspended \n\nparticles seem to be the most important natural vehicle for these \n\ncolloidal viruses in water column as a result of this phenomenon \n\n(GERBA et al., 1988; SCHWARTZBROD, 1995).  \n\nRecent studies suggested that sediments play an important role on \n\npathogens spreading acting as reservoirs from which these pathogens \n\n\n\n38 \n\ncan be released again on water column as a result of natural or artificial \n\nphenomena such as wind or swimming activities (BOSCH, 1998; ALM, \n\net al., 2003; SALVO; FABIANO, 2007; SEARCY et al., 2006).  \n\nEnteric viruses are major agents of gastroenteritis and hepatitis \n\noutbreaks in humans. Some of these viruses have been detected in water \n\nand sediment: human adenovirus (HAdV) which cause various diseases \n\nincluding gastroenteritis, upper and lower respiratory system infections, \n\nand conjunctivitis (WONG et al., 2013; JIANG et al., 2006; CALGUA \n\net al., 2011, VERHEYEN et al., 2009, MIURA et al., 2009), rotaviruses \n\n(RVA) which is the major viral agent of severe diarrhea in children \n\n(GREEN; LEWIS, 1999; LE GUYADER et al., 1994) and hepatitis A \n\nvirus which cause hepatitis (LE GUYADER et al., 1994; \n\nJOTHIKUMAR et al.,  2000).  \n\n \n\n1.2.1 Adenovirus  \n\nAdenovirus constitutes a large group of DNA viruses that infect \n\nhumans among other species (PEREIRA, 1963). The virus was first \n\ndiscovered in 1953 by Rowe and colleagues (ROWE et al., 1953) where \n\nthey reported a viral agent causing degeneration of epithelial-like cells \n\nfrom tonsils and adenoids surgically removed from children. After \n\nHilleman and co-workers isolated related agents from military personnel \n\nwith respiratory illness in the United States (HILLEMAN et al., 1954). \n\nThe viruses were first called adenoid degeneration (AD), adenoid-\n\npharyngeal conjunctival (APC) and acute respiratory disease (ARD) \n\nagents, but in 1956 they were named adenoviruses (ENDERS et al., \n\n1956). Adenoviruses were then associated with respiratory disease, \n\nacute hemorrhagic cystitis, gastroenteritis and epidemic kerato \n\nconjunctivitis (EKC). However, in 1962 it was demonstrated for the first \n\ntime that adenovirus type 12 could induce malignant tumors in rodents \n\n(TRENTIN et al., 1962). Other serotypes (including Ad5) were found to \n\nbe non-oncogenic.  \n\nAll Adenoviruses belongs to the family Adenoviridae, with \nicosahedral viral capsid which is divided into five genera: \n\nMastadenoviruses infecting mammals, Aviadenovirus infecting birds, \n\nSiadenovirus infects birds and frogs and finally Atadenovirus infecting a \n\nbroad range of hosts including avian, reptile and marsupial host \n\n(BENKO et al., 2000). A possible fifth genera infecting fishes has been \n\nproposed to be called Ichtadenovirus (BENKO et al., 2002) as shown in \n\nFig. 2.  \n\nThe genera are separated primarily on the basis of difference in \n\nimmunological properties of the virions. There are fifty-six human \n\nhttp://aem.asm.org/search?author1=Jens+Verheyen&amp;sortspec=date&amp;submit=Submit\n\n\n39 \n\nadenovirus serotypes and they have been distinguished on the basis of \n\ntheir resistance to neutralizing by antiserum to other known \n\nadenoviruses (DE JONG et al., 1999; CDC-National Center for \n\nImmunization and Respiratory Diseases, 2015).  \n\nHuman adenoviruses cause infections of various severities. They are \n\nassociated with different clinical syndromes which are caused by \n\ncytopathogenic effect on cells in the infected organs. Subgroup C which \n\nincludes Ad type 5 is associated with respiratory illness (HORWITZ, \n\n2007) and it is suggested that the disease is transmitted via aerosol. \n\nOther subgroups are associated with pharyngoconjunctival fever, \n\nepidemic keratoconjuntivitis, and gastroenteritis. These infections are \n\nsuggested to be transmitted either via poorly chlorinated pools eye-to-\n\nhand-hand-to-eye contact (AZAR et al., 1996) and fecal-oral routes \n\n(WADELL, 1988; HORWITZ, 2007). \n\n \nFigure 2: General structure of the adenovirus schematically represented: a) The \n\nshape of the icosahedral viral capsid with their hexons and pentons, b) and \n\nfimbriae internal content of the viral capsid (genome and protein monitoring).  \n\n \nSource: Adapted from MARTIN (2012). \n\n \n\nHAdV causes many diseases such as gastroenteritis, urethritis, \n\ncervicitis, pharyngitis, acute respiratory diseases, conjunctivitis, and \n\nmeningoencephalitis (FONG; LIPP, 2005). Of 56 serotypes of HAdV \n\nreported in the literature, replicate in the gastrointestinal tract and \n\ntherefore can be excreted in high concentrations in feces (10\n8\n-10\n\n13\n \n\nparticles / gram) (BANYAI et al., 2009). Since they are DNA viruses, \n\n\n\n40 \n\nwhich promotes more resistance to environmental degradation, such as \n\nUV radiation, temperature, chlorine concentration and pH variation, \n\nincluding sewage treatment procedures (PINA et al., 1998, CARTER, \n\n2005; LECHEVALLIER; AU, 2004; FONG; LIPP, 2005). Furthermore, \n\nHAdV have been described in drinking water (FONG et al., 2005; \n\nRIGOTTO et al., 2010; GARCIA et al., 2012), in recreational waters \n\n(MIAGOSTOVICH et al., 2008; SINCLAIR et al., 2009; FONGARO et \n\nal., 2012), associated with disease outbreaks in swimming pools \n\n(PAPAPETROPOLOU; VANTARAKIS, 1995; HARLEY et al., 2001), \n\nand in polluted waters (PINA et al., 1998; LAVERICK et al., 2004; LEE \n\net al., 2004; MIAGOSTOVICH et al., 2008; WONG et al., 2009; \n\nRIGOTTO et al., 2010; MORESCO et al., 2012). Moreover, HAdV \n\nwere found to be more prevalent than other enteric viruses in different \n\naquatic environment (WONG et al., 2009; WYN-JONES et al., 2011; \n\nGARCIA et al., 2012; FONGARO et al., 2012; MORESCO et al., \n\n2012). All together, these characteristics may provide a useful index of \n\nhuman faecal pollution and human viral contamination. Among other \n\nenteric viruses, adenovirus is considered a high priority emerging \n\ncontaminant present in drinking water, candidate parameter \n\ncontamination of the aquatic environment (USEPA, 2009). \n\nThe hexon is the largest capsid protein. The molecular mass is \n\napproximately 360kDa consisting of three identical subunits with \n\n120kDa each (ATHAPPILLY et al., 1994). The hexon surface loops \n\ndisplay the highest variability between adenovirus serotypes and contain \n\nmost of the type specific epitopes (EBNER et al., 2005). \n\nAll Adenoviruses genomes are double stranded DNA of \n\napproximately 36Kb. After infection, the transcription of AdV has two \n\nmainly phases namely early (occur before replication) and late phases \n\n(occur after replication). \n\nThe entire adenovirus genome is a linear, double-stranded DNA of \n\napproximately 36Kb. There are approximately 2 phases of adenovirus \n\ntranscription, named early and late phases, which occur before and after \n\nreplication. The early-transcribed regions are E1, E2, E3 and E4. E1 \n\ninclude two gene products, E1A and E1B which are involved in the \n\nreplication of this virus inside host cell. E2 acts as machinery for viral \n\nDNA replication and late genes transcriptions. E3 plays an important \n\nrole in modulating the immune response of infected cells. E4 promotes \n\nvirus DNA replication and shut-off synthesis of protein for the host cells \n\n(GRAHAM et al., 1977). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n41 \n\n1.2.2 Rotaviruses \n\nRotavirus is the most common cause of viral diarrheal disease in \n\nboth developed and developing countries worldwide, where they \n\nconstitute a major cause of mortality among the young children. More \n\nthan 500,000 children under five years of age still die from rotavirus \n\ninfection each year (KAPIKIAN et al., 2001). Human rotaviruses were \n\ndiscovered in 1973 by Ruth Bishop and her colleagues by electron \n\nmicrograph images (BISHOP et al., 1973). Rotavirus is a genus of \n\ndouble-stranded RNA virus within the family Reoviridae. Rotaviruses \n\nare icosahedral 65-70 nm particles, non-enveloped (resistant to lipid \n\nsolvents), and the capsid contains all enzymes for mRNA production \n\n(KAPIKIAN et al., 2001). \n\nThere are eight species of this virus, referred to as A, B, C, D, E, F, \n\nG and H. Rotavirus A, the most common specie, causes more than 90% \n\nof rotavirus infections in humans. The rotavirus genome contains 11 \n\nsegments of dsRNA, which have a size range of 0.6 to 3.3 kilobase pairs \n\neach (MATTION et al., 1994). These viruses are transmitted by faecal- \n\noral route. In infected persons, after an incubation period of about two \n\ndays, rotaviruses damage the cells that lining the small intestine and \n\ncause severe gastroenteritis. Symptoms often start with vomiting \n\nfollowed by four to eight days of profuse diarrhoea. Symptomatic \n\ninfection rates are highest in children under two years of age and \n\ndecrease in adults due to immunity that they acquired in their childhood. \n\nTransmission happens by contact with contaminated water, food, and \n\nsurface or even by contact with contaminated persons. Rotavirus is very \n\nstable in the environment and may remain viable in the environment for \n\nweeks or months if not disinfected (WILDE et al., 1992; ABAD et al., \n\n1994). Rotavirus shedding from the gastrointestinal tract prior to onset \n\nof diarrhea has been well documented in the literature (LUDIN et al., \n\n2003). \n\nZoonotic nature of rotavirus is reported in some cases worldwide. \n\nThe segmented nature of the RV genome allows for gene reassortment \n\nupon co-infection of a single cell with 2 different RV strains and this \n\nmay highlight the role of animal as a source of rotavirus infection to \n\nhumans (NAKAGOMI; NAKAGOMI, 1993). Rotaviruses have been \n\ndetected in raw or treated sewage (KARGAR et al., 2013). \n\nThere are six viral proteins (VPs) that form the virus particle (virion) \n\nas shown in Fig. 3. These structural proteins are called VP1, VP2, VP3, \n\nVP4, VP6 and VP7. In addition to the VPs, there are six nonstructural \n\nproteins (NSPs), which are only produced in cells infected by rotavirus. \n\nThese are called NSP1, NSP2, NSP3, NSP4, NSP5 and NSP6.  The \n\n\n\n42 \n\nglycoprotein VP7 defines the G serotypes and the protease-sensitive \n\nprotein VP4 defines P serotypes (KIRKWOOD, 2010). \n\nThe virus is composed by three concentric shells that enclose 11 \n\ngene segments. The outermost shell contains two important proteins \n\nVP7, or G-protein, and VP4, or P-protein. VP7 and VP4 define the \n\nserotype of the virus and induce neutralizing antibody that is probably \n\ninvolved in immune protection. G1 [P8] genotype is the world's most \n\nprevalent, accounting for over 70% of RV-A infections in North \n\nAmerica, Europe and Australia, but only 30% of RV-A infection in \n\nSouth America and Asia, and 23% in Africa (TATE et al., 2010). \n\n \nFigure 3: Schematic representation of a rotavirus particle containing its major \n\nviral protein of the respective layers: VP2 (internal), VP4 (external) VP6 \n\n(middle) and VP7 (external) and ds RNA genetic material.  \n\n \n\n \nSource: Adapted from LI et al., (2009). \n\n \n\nAnimal and human RVs in vitro cultivation has been done by using \n\nof primary and transformed monkey kidney cells (HASEGAWA et al., \n\n1982; SATO et al., 1981; WARD et al., 1991; WARD et al., 1984; \n\nWYATT et al., 1983; WYATT et al., 1980) Cultivation is achieved by \n\npretreatment of virus with trypsin as a proteolytic activation (5 to 10 \n\n\u00b5g/mL). Many cell lines are used for isolation of rotavirus from the \n\nclinical samples such as simian MA104 rhesus monkey kidney cells and \n\ncontinuous human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (CaCo-2 and HT-29) \n\nbut at the same time there are many rotavirus out of group A proven to \n\nbe quite fastidious and difficult to grow on cell lines (LI et al., 2009). \nIn the United States alone, 2.7 million cases of rotavirus \n\ngastroenteritis occurred yearly before initiation of the rotavirus \n\nvaccination. Rotavirus infections occur primarily during cool, dry \n\nseasons and the seasonal distribution of rotavirus infection has been \n\nextensively reported in many studies worldwide (KAPIKIAN et al., \n\n\n\n43 \n\n2001; MORESCO et al., 2012, RIGOTTO et al., 2010, SATO et al \n\n2010; FONGARO et al., 2012). \n\nSince 2006, two oral rotavirus vaccines have been licensed and \n\navailable in North and South American, European and Eastern \n\nMediterranean countries, where they have significantly reduced the \n\nburden of rotavirus-induced diarrhea. \n\nIn 2006, a live, oral, human-bovine reassortant rotavirus vaccine \n\n(RotaTeq\u00ae, produced by Merck and Company, Whitehouse Station, \n\nNew Jersey) was recommended for routine vaccination of US infants. \n\nThree doses of this vaccine are recommended to be administered at ages \n\n2, 4, and 6 month. RotaTeq\u00ae contains five reassortant rotaviruses \n\ndeveloped from human and bovine parent rotavirus strains that express \n\nhuman outer capsid proteins of five common circulating strains (G1, G2, \n\nG3, G4, and P[8] (subgroup P1A)) \n\nIn 2006, an attenuated monovalent G1,P[8] human rotavirus strain \n\nRotarix\u00ae (produced by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, \n\nBelgium), and is recommended by the manufacturer to be orally \n\nadministered in 2 doses to infants at ages 2 and 4 months. In Brazil, \n\nattenuated G1P [8] vaccine, was included in the Immunization Program \n\nsince 2006 (FUMIAN et al., 2011). \n\nIn 2014, Rotavac was licensed by the Drugs Controller General of \n\nIndia (DCGI). The vaccine originated in India from an attenuated \n\n(weakened) strain of rotavirus that was isolated from an Indian child \n\n(WHO, 2014). \n\n \n\n1.2.3 Hepatitis A virus (HAV) \n\nFeinstone and co-workers in 1973 (FEINSTONE et al., 1973) were \n\nidentifies HAV by immune electron microscopy of infected persons \n\nfeces. In 1979 the first trial for cultivating HAV in cell culture done by \n\nProvost and Hilleman (PROVOST; HILLEMAN, 1979). HAV is a \n\nmember of Picornaviridae family, and is the only member and type \n\nspecies of the genus Hepatovirus. HAV is a nonenveloped virus, 27 to \n\n32 nm in diameter with an icosahedral capsid (HOLLINGER; \n\nEMERSON, 2001) as shown in Fig. 4. Virion RNA is plus sense, single \n\nstranded and 7,478 nucleotides in length. An icosahedral capsid formed \n\nby several copies of three or four VP1 protein, VP2, VP3 and VP4, and \n\nthe latter one, play an important role in the formation of the viral particle \n\n(HOLLINGER; EMERSON, 2001; PINTO et al., 2010). HAV has only \n\none serotype and seven different genetic groups (four humans and three \n\nsimian) (CRISTINA; COSTA-MATTIOLI, 2007). \n\n\n\n44 \n\nTransmission of HAV may be occurring by ingestion of \n\ncontaminated water and food or even by contaminated shellfish with the \n\ntransmission via the fecal-oral. Following ingestion, HAV enters the \n\nbloodstream through the epithelium of the oropharynx or intestine and \n\ngo directly to the liver, where it multiplies within \n\nhepatocytes. Virions are secreted into the bile and released in stool with \n\nlarge concentration after about 11 days from symptoms appearance. \n\n \nFigure 4: Diagram of the picornavirus structure of the hepatitis A virus (HAV). \n\nThe icosahedral capsid is made up of four viral polypeptides (VP1 to VP4). \n\nInside the capsid is a single-strand positive sense RNA that has a genomic viral \n\nprotein (VPg) on the 5'end.  \n\n \n\n \nSource: http://pathmicro.med.sc.edu/virol/hepatitis-virus.htm \n\n \n\nHAV adapted in fetal rhesus monkey kidney cell line (FRhk 4), but \n\nHAV did not show any morphological changes on the infected cells. In \n\n1978, MATHIESEN and co-worker (MATHIESEN et al., 1978) succeed \n\nto demonstrate HAV replication by direct immunofluorescence analysis. \n\nHowever, HAV is usually difficult to adapt and grow in vitro scale. \nThe clinical course may vary from asymptomatic, acute self-limiting \n\nhepatitis in patients with unapparent or subclinical hepatitis to life \n\nthreatening acute liver failure (ALF) which occasionally develop \n\nfulminant hepatitis and die (HOLLINGER; EMERSON, 2001). \n\nPoor sanitary conditions and regional socio-economic conditions are \n\nthe main sources for outbreaks caused by HAV (VILLAR et al., 2006). \n\nHAV consider being endemic in Brazil and this is confirmed by many \nepidemiological data that show that 90% of Brazilian people have anti-\n\nHAV antibodies (CARRILHO et al., 2005). \n\nUncooked bivalves such as oysters and clams which harvested from \n\nwater contaminated with sewage are responsible for many outbreaks \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oropharynx\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virions\n\n\n45 \n\nworldwide and this fact due to these shellfish able to filter large amount \n\nof water (contaminated by human sewage) per hour over a short period \n\nduring their feeding where HAV can be concentrated at least 100-fold \n\nand persist for about 7 days (ENRIQUEZ et al., 1992; S\u00c1NCHEZ et al., \n\n2002; VILLAR et al., 2006).  \n\nMany studies have shown the presence of HAV in aquatic \n\nenvironment including water treatment systems, lagoon and surface \n\nwater since it has a chemical-physical characteristics that ensure their \n\nstrength, it is not susceptible to degradation by detergents, relatively \n\nresistant to temperatures up to 60\u00b0C and inactivated partially when \n\nincubated for a period of 10 to 12 hours at this temperature and may still \n\nremain infectious for days or months in contaminated water (Cuthbert \n\n2001; HOLLINGER; EMERSON, 2007). \n\nThere are two types of vaccines against HAV, the first one \n\ncontaining inactivated HAV (Havrix) and another containing a live \n\nattenuated virus (VAQTA) (IRVING et al., 2012). The vaccine protects \n\nagainst HAV in more than 95% of cases for longer than 25 years. The \n\nvaccine should be given in the muscle of the upper arm and be given in \n\ntwo doses for the best protection. An initial dose provides protection \n\nstarting two to four weeks after vaccination; the second dose, given six \n\nto 12 months later, provides protection for over 20 years and the proven \n\nefficiency of vaccination, since there is only one serotype of HAV \n\ncurrent worldwide (IRVING et al., 2012). \n\n \n\n1.2.4 Norovirus (NVs) \n\nNorovirus was identified in 1972 by Kapikian and colleagues \n\n(Kapikian et al., 1972), using immune electron microscopy. Noroviruses \n\nbelong to Caliciviridae family, RNA single-stranded positive sense, \n\nnon-enveloped with a diameter of approximately 27 nm. Contain three \n\nopen reading frames (ORFs). The ORF1 encodes a large polyprotein \n\nwhich is cleaved at six other important proteins involved in viral \n\nreplication, like the viral polymerase. ORF 2 encodes the structural \n\nprotein VP1 and VP2 which are important for the ORF 3 protein. \n\n(ATMAR, 2010) as shown in Fig. 5. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n46 \n\nFigure 5: schematic description of a viral particle, with emphasis on the HAV \n\nstructural protein VP1 \n\n \nSource: Adapted from viral zone website \n\n(http://viralzone.expasy.org/viralzone/all_by_species/194.html, 2016) \n\n \n\nNorovirus is a very contagious virus. It can be transmitted via \n\ndealing with infected persons, contaminated water or food, even by \n\neating uncooked shellfish. Infection by norovirus can lead to serious \n\ngastroenteritis especially for young children and older adults. \n\nWorldwide, norovirus is the leading cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks. \n\nThe most common norovirus strain (genogroup II genotype 4) is a major \n\ncause of outbreaks worldwide with an estimated 23 million cases in the \n\nUnited States of America each year, is transmitted by the fecal-oral \n\nroute and by aerosol (SUFFREDINI et al., 2012; MESQUITA et al., \n\n2011; TERIO et al., 2010; GENTRY; VINJE; LIPP, 2009). \n\nUntil this moment there is only one publication in the literature done \n\nby JONES et al., (2014) which describes the possible culture and \n\nreplication of human norovirus in vitro with the presence of enteric \n\nbacteria that express antigens HBGA (histo-blood group antigen). \n\nHowever, the murine norovirus (NVM) was the only norovirus that \n\nshowed in vitro replication capacity in cell culture (WOBUS; \n\nTHACKRAY; HERBERT, 2006). \n\nMurine norovirus (MNV-1) which was used in the fourth chapter of \n\nthis work, has been widely used as a substitute and surrogate for human \n\nnorovirus, it belongs to the same family and has great structural \nsimilarity and transmission route (CANNON et al., 2006). Murine \n\nnorovirus has the ability to infect in vitro murine macrophage cell line \n\nRAW264.7, causing a clear cytopathic effect in about 36 h. The lysis \n\nassay plate is well standardized, providing information on viral viability \n\nhttp://viralzone.expasy.org/viralzone/all_by_species/194.html\n\n\n47 \n\nwithin 48 h (GONZALEZ-HERNANDEZ; CUNHA; WOBUS, 2012; \n\nPREDMORE; LI, 2011). \n\n \n\n1.3 Coliphage as indicator for fecal pollution \n\nAlthough enteric bacterial indicators have been used as acceptable \n\ntools to estimate the microbiological quality of environmental waters, \n\nmany waterborne pathogens that cause illness and diseases in humans \n\nare enteric viruses. Microbial indicators such as total coliforms, fecal \n\ncoliforms may be unreliable indicators for predicting enteric virus \n\npresence in contaminated water and the associated human health risks. \nCompared to bacterial indicators, enteric viruses have shown higher \n\nsurvival rates during wastewater and drinking water treatment and \n\ngreater persistence in environmental waters (CONTRERAS-COLL et \n\nal., 2002; DURAN et al., 2002; HARWOOD et al., 2005; MOCE-\n\nLLIVINA et al., 2005; JOFRE et al., 1995).  \n\nDue to higher persistence and resistance of waterborne enteric \n\nviruses compared to bacterial indicators, water which is defined as safe \n\nbased on bacterial indicator measurement may still cause disease or \n\nillness to consumers due to the enteric viruses still present (DORE et al., \n\n2000; FORMIGA-CRUZ et al., 2003). Therefore, bacterial indicators \n\nalone do not provide a complete assessment of microbiological water \n\nquality. By using at least one or two viral indicator for prediction the \n\npresence of enteric viruses in the aquatic environment will help us to \n\nbetter assessment of water quality and provide more confidence on \n\nwater safety.  \n\nThere are several candidate viral indicators to predict virus \n\ncontamination in environmental waters. Many studies advocated phages \n\ninfected enteric bacteria as a potential viral indicator to estimate the \n\nmicrobial contamination in the water environment, also as indicators of \n\nwater treatment process efficacy (HAVELAAR, 1993). Bacteriophages, \n\nspecifically phages of Escherichia coli (Coliphages) are proposed \n\ncandidate indicators of human enteric viruses in water. They are present \n\nin human and animal feces and some are small, icosahedral and non-\n\nenveloped viruses, making them structurally similar to enteric viruses. \n\nThere are two main types of coliphages: somatic and the male-specific \n\n(F+).  \n\nThe somatic coliphages are DNA viruses which are able to infect E. \ncoli by attaching to specific sites on the outer cell membrane, such as \n\nlipopolysaccharide. The male-specific coliphages are single-stranded \n\nRNA and DNA viruses that infect the cell via the pili appendages \n\npresent on the surface of male strains of the bacterium. Many studies in \n\n\n\n48 \n\nthe literature documented that male-specific coliphages play as viral \n\nindicators depending on their investigations (DORE et al., 2000; COLE \n\net al., 2003; COLFORD et al., 2007; LOVE; SOBSEY, 2007). However, \n\ntheir infrequent presence in human feces, their relative scarcity and their \n\nrapid decay rates in high temperature waters (LOVE et al., 2007) limit \n\ntheir usefulness as indicator viruses. Somatic coliphages also have been \n\nproposed as fecal indicators of human enteric viruses in studies of \n\nsewage, source water for drinking water and marine waters (MOCE-\n\nLLIVINA et al., 2005; MUNIESA et al., 2007; JOFRE, 2008), and real-\n\ntime monitoring of somatic coliphages as fecal indicators has been \n\nsuggested by previous investigators (ARAUJO et al., 1997; SKRABER \n\net al., 2004, GARCIA-ALJARO et al., 2008). So we include in this part \n\nof the work the detection and enumeration of somatic coliphage (PHI-X-\n\n174) as indicator of enteric viruses to try to make a possible correlation \n\nbetween them and the presence of the studied enteric viruses (HAdV, \n\nRVA, HAV). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n49 \n\nREFERENCES  \n\n \nABAD, F.X.; PINT\u00d3, R.M.; BOSCH, A.

INTRODUCTION  \nThis chapter will present and discuss the results regarding the enteric \n\nviruses assessment in water and sediment samples collected at \n\nSangradouro River and beach of Peri Lagoon by real time PCR (qPCR) \n\nand also by cell culture techniques. These results were published in \n\nJournal of Water and Health. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n69 \n\n2. MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\nThe general experimental design to perform the present work \n\nconsisted in two stages: 1) monitoring enteric viruses (HAdV, RVA and \n\nHAV) during the summer and winter seasons of the year 2013 as well as \n\nthe physical-chemical parameters in surface water and sediment samples \n\nof Sangradouro River and Peri Lagon; 2) evaluating HAdV infectivity \n\nfor all positive samples detected by qPCR. \n\n \n\n2.1 Description of the study area \n\n2.1.1 Peri lagoon  \n\nThe Peri Lagoon is a small coastal lagoon, located in southern Brazil, \n\nin Santa Catarina state, in the southeastern portion of Santa Catarina \n\nIsland (27\n?\n44\u00b4S and 48\n\n?\n31\u00b4W), Florian\u00f3polis. The Peri Lagoon \n\nenvironment has suffered over several decades, a strong environmental \n\ndegradation with an increasing population occupying their surroundings \n\nand landfills. Dumping of sewage is one of the most common forms of \n\npollution coastal areas and the population living in the surrounding areas \n\nthat are contaminated is affected, since many people use this \n\nenvironment as their source of livelihood and recreation. Furthermore, \n\nthe contaminants released together with the sewage may accumulate in \n\nthe sediment, including bacteria and viruses pathogens that cause risks \n\nto health (LEES, 2000; MUNIAN-MUJIKA et al., 2000) (Fig. 7).  \n\nThe Peri lagoon has a surface area of 5.7 km\n2\n, is surrounded by \n\nmountains, and currently constitutes the main source of drinking water \n\nfor the island inhabitants because it has no direct seawater influence. \n\nWaters of the lagoon are drained into Sangradouro River in a \n\nunidirectional sense that extends towards the south of the island, \n\ncrossing areas of urban occupation and emptying into the ocean to the \n\neast between the beaches of Arma\u00e7\u00e3o and Matadeiro. The river waters \n\nare used to deposit illegal sewage discharge from neighborhood \n\nresidences. The climate in the area is subtropical, with rainfall well \n\ndistributed throughout the year (1.85 mm annual rainfall), although \n\nrainfall is more frequent during the summer months than during the \n\nwinter (CECCA, 1996 and 1997). The lagoon was the first point of \n\nwater collection as shown in Fig. 6 (a, b). \n\nThe second collection site, comprised of points 2 through 6, was in \n\nSangradouro River.

Four collections were done for each season, \n\nwith summer collections occurring during March/April 2013 and winter \n\ncollections occurring during July/August 2013. Additionally, a total of \n\n48 sediment samples (20 g was taken from each collection for analysis) \n\nwere collected in parallel with the water samples at each collection point \n\nusing Petersen grab samplers (provided by LAPAD- Laborat\u00f3rio de \n\nBiologia e Cultivo de Peixes de \u00c1gua Doce) as shown in Fig. 13.  \n\nThe samples were transported to the laboratory on ice in sterile \n\ncontainers and were immediately processed. A sum of 96 samples was \n\ncollected from 6 sites during one year.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n73 \n\nFigure 13: Petersen grab dredge used for sediment sample collection \n\n \nSource: provided by LAPAD- Laborat\u00f3rio de Biologia e Cultivo de \n\nPeixes de \u00c1gua Doce-UFSC) \n\n \n\n2.3 Physical-chemical analysis  \n\nWater temperature (WT), conductivity (Cond), pH, salinity (Sal.) \n\nand dissolved oxygen (DO) were immediately measured in situ with \nspecific probes (WTW-Multi350i) after collection, as is outlined in the \n\nstandard methods for examination of water and wastewater (APHA, \n\n1998).  \n\nFor sediment samples, the total solid, volatile solid, fixed solid and \n\nhumidity were measured, according to APHA (2012). (These analyzes \n\nwere carried out in partnership with the Water Ecology Laboratory \n\nContinental, Department of Ecology and Zoology at the Federal \n\nUniversity of Santa Catarina, coordinated by Prof. Dr. Mauricio Mello \n\nPetrucio). \n\n \n\n2.4 Viral concentration in water samples \n\nDetermination of viral concentrations in the surface water samples \n\nwas performed using the protocol described by KATAYAMA et al., \n\n(2002). Briefly, water samples were filtered in a vacuum system \n\nprovided with negatively charged membrane (Nihon Millipore\n\u00ae\n, Tokyo, \n\nJapan) with a pore size of 0.45 \u00b5m and a diameter of 142 mm (Fig. 14), \n\nwith a flow of 200 mL / min. Prior to filtration, the pH was adjusted to \n\n7.5-8.0 with the addition of 25 mL of MgCl2 [2M] so, the viral particles, \n\nnaturally negatively charged, were turned positive after the addition of \n\nthe cationic Mg\n2+\n\n ions, allowing the adsorption of these positively \n\ncharged viral particles on the negatively charged membranes during the \n\nfiltration process. The membrane was further washed with 350 mL of \n\nH2SO4 solution [0.5 mM] pH 3.0 to ensure retention of viral particles in \n\nit and remove other biosolids present. Then, the membrane was removed \n\nfrom the filter and, in sterile glassware; the viruses were eluted, by the \n\n\n\n74 \n\naddition of 11 mL of NaOH [1 mM] pH 10.5, kept in constant contact \n\nwith the membrane by stirring during 10 min. The eluate was \n\nneutralized by adding 50 ?L of H2SO4 solution [50 mM] and 50 ?L Tris-\n\nEDTA buffer solution [100X] 1 mM pH 8.0. After this step, the samples \n\nwere ultra-filtrated by using a Centriprep Concentrator 50\n\u00ae\n system \n\n(Nihon Millipore\n\u00ae\n, Tokyo, Japan) to obtain a final volume of \n\napproximately 5.0 mL. The concentrated samples were stored at ?80\u00b0C \n\nuntil further analysis. \n\n \nFigure 14: Vacuum filtration system with a capacity of 5L water, used for viral \n\nconcentration. \n\n \nSource: Laboratory of Applied Virology (LVA-UFSC) \n\n \n\n2.5 Viral concentration from sediment samples \nDetermination of viral concentrations in the sediment samples was \n\nperformed according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, \n\n1992) guidelines, with minor modifications as described by \n\nSCHLINDWEIN et al., (2010).  \n\nBriefly, 0.05 M AlCl3 solution was added to 20g of wet sediment \n\ndiluted with the addition of an equal volume of phosphate buffer (PBS), \n\nand the pH was adjusted to 3.5 with 5 M HCl. To dislodge viruses, \n\nsamples were then subjected to sonication on ice 3 times, each for 30 \nsec. followed by a centrifugation step at 2,422 ?g for 15 min. at 4 \u00baC. \n\nThe resulting pellet was suspended in 10 mL Glycine buffer 0.25M, pH \n\n9.5 and stirred during 1 hr, followed by another centrifugation step at \n\n7,656 ?g for 30 min. at 4\u00baC. For viral concentration, PEG 6000 \n\nprecipitation was employed as described by LEWIS; METCALF (1988). \n\n\n\n75 \n\nThe supernatant was transferred to another tube containing 8% PEG \n\n6000, pH 7.2 and stay on the stirring for about 2 h 4\u00baC. A final \n\ncentrifugation step was done at 7,656 ?g for 90 min. at 4\u00baC. The pellet \n\nwas suspended in 10.0 mL of 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.2). Decontamination \n\nstep was carried out adding chloroform (1:3) followed by centrifugation \n\nat 7,656 ?g for 15 min. The upper (aqueous) phase was recovered, \n\naliquoted and stored at ?80\u00b0C until further analysis. \n\n \n\n2.6 Evaluation of viral recovery in surface water samples by \n\nadsorption-elution method  \nWater samples from the sampling sites were artificially inoculated \n\nwith a known amount of the HAdV (2x10\n6\n PFU/mL). The samples were \n\nconcentrated as described above and the viral recovery was determined \n\nby plaque assay and also by integrated cell culture RT-qPCR reaction, \n\npreceded by enzymatic treatment (ICC-et- RT-qPCR) (FONGARO et \n\nal., 2012). \n\n \n\n2.7 Evaluation of viral recovery in sediment samples using \n\nGlycine/PEG buffer method compared with beef extract method \nThis experiment was designed to determine the efficiency of virus \n\nrecovery after the concentration of the samples using the methods \n\ndescribed by SCHLINDWEIN et al., (2010) and KATZENELSON et \n\nal., (1976) as described in section 2.5 and to decide which one would be \n\nused for the field samples, according to their performances. Two \n\nexperiments were conducted in duplicate to evaluate the viral recovery \n\nrates from sediment samples. Murine Norovirus (MNV-1) and Simian \n\nRotavirus (RV-SA11) were used as model viruses to seed the samples. \n\nSediment samples from the sampling sites were artificially inoculated \n\nwith a known amount of these viruses (2.6x10\n9\n GC/mL for MNV and \n\n8.0x10\n6\n GC/mL for RV-SA11). The samples were concentrated \n\nseparately by Glycine/Polyethylene buffer as described in section 2.5 \n\nand beef extract method which was done briefly as following: sediment \n\nsample (300g) diluted in beef extract 3%, and then stirring step was \n\ndone for 30 min. to form flocs. After a centrifugation step at 1,914 ?g \n\nduring 30 min. at 4\u00baC the supernatant was recovered and the pH was \n\nadjusted to 3.5 using 5M HCl and stirred again for more 30 min. Then a \n\ncentrifugation step at 1914 ?g for 15 min. at 4\u00baC was carried out and the \n\npellet was suspended in 10 mL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 9). \n\nDecontamination step was carried out as described above in section 2.5 \n\nusing chloroform. Then, MNV and SA-11 RV recovery from the \n\nrespective samples was quantified by real-time RT-PCR using a \n\n\n\n76 \n\nTaqMan technique, as previously described by BAERT, et al., (2008) \n\nand ZENG et al., (2008). The calculation of the RVA-SA11 recovery \n\npercentage (in number of genome copies) was accounted for the original \n\nnumber of viruses seeded in the experiment. \n\n \n\n2.8 Extraction of viral nucleic acids \nNucleic acid extraction was performed using a QIAamp MinElute\n\n\u00ae\n \n\nVirus Spin Kit (Qiagen, Brazil), following the manufacturer\u2019s \n\ninstructions. Briefly, the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit simplifies \n\npurification of viral DNA and RNA with fast spin-column filled with a \n\nsilica-based reagent based on the protocol already described by BOOM \n\net al., (1990). The starting sample volumes were 0.2 mL and this \n\ntechnique combines the selective binding properties of the nucleic acids \n\nto the  silica columns with a flexible elution volumes of around 60 ?L \n\nfollowed by storing at -80 \u00b0C prior to analysis. \n\n \n\n2.9 Quantitative PCR assay (qPCR) \n\nReal time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed as described \n\nby HERNROTH et al., (2002); JOTHIKUMAR et al., (2005); ZENG \n\net al., (2008) and Baert et al., (2008) for amplification of HAdV, \n\nHAV, RVA and MNV, respectively, using primers and probes as \n\nshown in Table 1. The Taqman Universal qPCR Master Mix \n\n(Applied Biosystems) was used for HAdV and the Kit QuantiTect \n\nprobe RT-PCR (QIAGEN) was used for HAV, RVA, and MNV.  \n\nAll amplifications were performed in a StepOne Plus\n\u00ae\n Real-Time \n\nqPCR System (Applied Biosystems). Each sample was analyzed in \n\nduplicate. To avoid inhibition of the enzymatic assay, the nucleic \n\nacids were prior diluted at 1:10 before their addition on the qPCR \n\nreaction. A standard curve was generated for all of the viruses using \n\na 10-fold serial dilution of the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen, USA) \n\ncontaining the target region appropriate for the virus type. Triplicate \n\nsamples were used for each dilution point, and a standard curve was \n\nrun for each set of assays. Ultrapure water was used as the non-\n\ntemplate control, and non-amplification controls were included in \n\neach run. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n77 \n\nTable 1: Primers and probes used for detection of genomes copies of \n\nHAdV, HAV, RVA, and MNV \n\n \n\n \n \n\n2.10 Viral integrity test  \nThis study aimed to identify intact adenovirus particles (HAdV) \n\nthrough enzymatic assay in order to degrade possible free viral genomes \n\npresent in the sample matrix and compare the total genomes detected \n\nwith the genomes from intact viral particles. \n\nTo study the presence of undamaged HAdV particles, the samples \n\nwere treated with DNAse I. Briefly, the reaction was performed by \n\nadding 1 U of DNAse I (a sufficient quantity to degrade 100% of DNA \n\nadded), 1X buffer and 170 ?L of nuclease-free water as a negative \n\ncontrol for each concentrated sample, and the reaction was then \n\nincubated for 15 min at room temperature. Then, the enzyme activity \n\nwas inactivated by adding EDTA at final concentration of 25 mM and \n\nincubation for 10 min. at 70\u00b0C. This was done to check the integrity of \n\nthe viral capsid, because genetic material that was not protected by the \n\nviral capsid would be degraded by this nuclease (NUANUALSUWAN; \n\nCLIVER, 2002). All samples positive for HAdV in the real time PCR \n\nassay were subjected to a DNAse I degradation reaction following the \n\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) to \n\ndegrade all free viral DNA present in the samples, as described by \n\nVIANCELLI et al., (2012). All treated samples were subjected to \n\nnucleic acid extraction and qPCR, as described in section 2.9. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n78 \n\n2.11 Study of the infectivity of HAdV in surface water and sediment \n\nsamples \n\nThis study aimed to identify infectious/viable particles of HAdV that \n\nwere previously detected by qPCR, by inoculating samples in cell \n\nculture and perform the plaque assay which was used to assess the viral \n\ninfectivity. \n\n \n\n2.11.1 Cell Line \nThe cultivation of the cell line A549 (epithelial cells derived from \n\nhuman lung carcinoma and permissive to most human adenoviruses \n\nkindly provided by Dr. Rosina Giron\u00e8s from the University of \n\nBarcelona, Spain) was carried out in cell culture flasks (75cm\n2\n), using \n\nminimal essential medium containing Eagle's salts (MEM) \n\nsupplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum [(FBS) Gibco], 1% \n\nantibiotics and antifungal [(PSA-penicillin G Cultilab 100U/mL/100 g \n\nstreptomycin sulfate/mL /Amphotericin B 0.25 g / mL. \n\n \n\n2.11.2 Cytotoxicity assay  \n\nThe cytotoxicity of concentrated surface water and sediment samples \n\nwere evaluated on A549 cells. These cells were propagated in cell \n\nculture using 24-well plates at a density of 2.5 \u00d7 10\n5\n cells per well, as \n\ndescribed on section 2.12, but without addition of FBS, 24 h before \n\nconducting the tests. \n\nEnvironmental samples concentrated as described section 2.4 and \n\n2.5, were pretreated with 1% antibiotic/antifungal (100 U penicillin G / \n\nmL / streptomycin 100?g /mL amphotericin B 0.25?g /mL) and diluted \n\nin 1X MEM in the following proportions: 1:1, 1:2, 1:4. An inoculum of \n\n100 ?L of each dilution in triplicate were placed in contact with the cells \n\nfor 1h at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 atmosphere and uniform mixing every 15 \n\nmin. Subsequently, the inoculum was removed and 1 mL of MEM \n\ncontaining 1% PSA was added to the cells, two cell controls were \n\nmaintained and these cells contained only medium. The plates were \n\nincubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 atmosphere and the cell monolayer was \n\nmonitored for seven days. \n\nCells containing inoculated test samples were compared with control \n\ncell under a light microscope. Sequentially, cells were fixed and stained \n\nwith 300?L of Naphthalene Black solution (0.1% Naphthalene Black, \n\n5% Acetic Acid, pH 2.3-2.4). The cell monolayer was stained and \n\nexamined for the non-cytotoxic dilution, for each of tested samples in \n\norder to be furthered used for infectivity assays. \n\n \n\n\n\n79 \n\n2.11.3 Plaque Assay for HAdV  \n\nTo quantify the presence of infectious HAdV in environmental \n\nsamples, all of the water and sediment samples testing positive for viral \n\ngenome presence (as previously detected by qPCR) were treated with \n\nantibiotics (10 U/mL penicillin, 10 ?g/ mL streptomycin and 0.025 ?g \n\n/mL amphotericin B). For all tested samples, a non-cytotoxic dilution \n\nwas then selected and inoculated (0.2 mL) into A549 cells, in triplicate. \n\nThese cells were previously cultivated in 24-well tissue culture plates at \n\na density of 3.0 \u00d7 10\n6\n cells / well and were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 \n\nfor 24 h as described by FONGARO et al., (2013); CROMEANS et al., \n\n(2008); and RIGOTTO et al., (2010).  \n\nBriefly, the cells were incubated during 1h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 and \n\nwere gently rocked every 15 min for viral adsorption. The inoculated \n\ncells were then carefully washed once with pre-warmed PBS and \n\noverlaid with warm high glucose Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium \n\n(2x), 0.6% warm Bacto-agar containing 5% FBS, 0.1 mM sodium \n\npyruvate, 10 U/mL penicillin, 10 ?g/mL streptomycin and 26 mM \n\nMgCl2. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 7 days. One \n\nweek post-infection, the agar overlay was removed gently, and the cells \n\nwere stained with 20% Gram\u2019s crystal violet. The cell monolayer was \n\nexamined microscopically, and plaques were counted and expressed as \n\nPFU/mL. \n\n \n\n2.12 Statistical analyses \nTo evaluate the possible correlation between viral detection in \n\nsamples from each point of collection, a Pearson correlation and linear \n\nregression test, a two way ANOVA test and a Student\u2019s t test were \n\nperformed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (USA); data were considered \n\nstatistically significant at a P-value ? 0.05. \n \n\n3. RESULTS \n\n3.1 Physical-chemical analysis \nThe means of the physical-chemical parameters measured for all \n\nsamples from each collection point in both summer and winter \n\ncollections are presented in Table 2. According to these data, the \n\naverages of sample temperature, pH, salinity, and conductivity during \n\nsummer and winter, were not statistically significant (P>0.05), while the \nmean dissolved oxygen for each point of collection during the summer \n\nand winter was statistically significant among points of collection \n\n(P?0.01).  \n\n\n\n80 \n\nRegarding the sediment analysis, the averages of the total solids, \n\nfixed solids, volatile solids and humidity of the samples were not \n\nstatistically significant among the points of collection either in the \n\nsummer or winter periods (P>0.05), as shown in Table 2. As we can \n\nobserve on Fig. 15, the percent of dissolved oxygen at each point was \n\ndifferent but this difference during summer and winter was not \n\nstatistically significant (P>0.01). \n\n \nFigure 15: Percent average of dissolved Oxygen in each point of collection \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n81 \n\n \n\nTable 2: Physical-chemical analysis for surface water and sediment analysis in each point of collection during the summer (sum.) \n\nand winter (win.) seasons, statistically significant differences noted by (*), (#) SD= Standard deviation. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n83 \n\n \n\n3.2 Viral recovery assay for water and sediment samples  \n\nThe HAdV recovery rate, as determined by FONGARO et al., (2013) \n\nusing qPCR (GC units), was approximately 10% (total of 8 \u00d7 105 \n\nGC/mL) for water samples. For sediment experiment; the recovery of \n\nMNV was 7.7% (total of 2.02 \u00d7 10\n8\n GC/mL) for sediment and 68% \n\n(total of 1.77 \u00d7 10\n9\n GC/mL) for MilliQ water using Glycine/PEG \n\nmethod described by SCHLINDWEIN et al., (2010) and 0.002% (total \n\nof 7 \u00d7 10\n4\n GC/mL) for sediment and 87% for MilliQ water (total of 2.3 \n\n\u00d7 10\n9\n GC/mL) using the beef extract method described by \n\nKATZENELSON et al., (1976). For RV-SA11 the recovery using \n\nGlycine/PEG method was 46% (total of 3.7 \u00d7 10\n6\n GC/mL) for sediment \n\nand 70% (total of 5.6 \u00d7 10\n6\n GC/mL) for MilliQ water, while using the \n\nbeef extract method was 0.06% (total of 5.3 \u00d7 10\n3\n GC/mL) for sediment \n\nand 68% (total of 5.4 \u00d7 10\n6\n GC/mL) for MilliQ water as shown in Fig. \n\n16. \n\n \nFigure 16: Recovery rate for MNV-1 and RV-SA11 using two concentration \n\nmethods for viruses in sediment and MilliQ water. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n84 \n\n3.3 Viral analysis \n\nFor surface waters collected during the summer, the incidence of \n\nHAdV was 70.8% (17/24), ranging from 6.9 x 10\n5\n to 2.4 x 10\n\n8\n GC/L. \n\nAll 17 positive samples were shown to have undamaged particles after \n\nnuclease treatment, in concentrations ranging from 1.2 x 10\n4\n to 8.9 x 10\n\n4\n \n\nGC/L, and from these, 82.4% (14/17) contained infectious particles, in \n\nconcentrations ranging from 4.0 x 10\n3\n to 1.07 x 10\n\n4\n PFU/L. In winter \n\ncollections, the HAdV incidence was 62.5% (15/24), ranging from 8.9 x \n\n10\n5\n to 1.7 x 10\n\n8\n GC/L. Of these positive samples, 93.3% (14/15) of \n\nsamples had undamaged particles after nuclease treatment, in \n\nconcentrations ranging from 1.3 x 10\n3\n to 2.5 x 10\n\n4\n GC/L. All of these \n\nundamaged viruses were infectious by plaque assay. The mean results \n\nfor HAdV GC for each point were statistically significant for both the \n\nsummer and winter collections (P<0.05), as shown in Fig. 17 (a,b).  \nFor sediment samples collected in the summer, the HAdV incidence \n\nwas 37.5% (9/24), ranging from 4.2 x 10\n9\n to 1.9 x 10\n\n10 \nGC/Kg. All \n\npositive samples were shown to have undamaged particles after nuclease \n\ntreatment, in concentrations ranging from 1.8 x 10\n4\n to 8.6 x 10\n\n5\n GC/L. \n\nOf these samples, 66.7% (6/9) contained infectious HAdV, in \n\nconcentrations ranging from 1.3 x 10\n3\n to 8 x 10\n\n4\n PFU/Kg.

MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n2.1 Description of study area \n\nAs described before in Chapter ? Peri Lagoon is fed mainly by two \n\nwaterfalls:  Cachoeira Grande and Ribeir\u00e3o Grande; this Lagoon is \n\nwidely used for recreational activities (swimming and fishing) and \n\nstands out for participating in the System East-Coast-South Water \n\nTreatment Plant, supplying about 110,000 inhabitants of Florian\u00f3polis \n\nin the districts of Barra da Lagoa, Lagoa da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, Campeche, \n\nMorro das Pedras, Arma\u00e7\u00e3o and Ribeir\u00e3o da Ilha.  \n\n \n\n2.2 Sampling \nDue to its importance we selected four points in Peri Lagoon for \n\nwater and sediment sampling collections as collection sites 1) located at \n\nthe center of Lagoon and this site was composed by 4 collection points \n\nof water samples [surface water (100% light penetration), 0.9 meter in \n\ndeep (10% light penetration), 5.5 m in deep (1% light penetration), 8 m \n\nin deep (0% light penetration)], and one sediment sample as shown in \n\nFig. 22; site 2) located in waterfalls Cachoeira Grande as shown in Fig. \n\n23; site 3) located in waterfalls Ribeir\u00e3o Grande as shown in Fig. 24; \n\nsite 4) located in the beach of Lagoon as shown in Fig. 25;. Surface \n\nwater and sediment samples were collected monthly from January 2014 \n\nuntil December 2014, 7 water samples (include: 4 samples collected \n\nfrom surface water in different sites and 3 water samples collected from \n\ndifferent depth of water column), and 4 sediment samples / collection, \n\ntotaling 132 water and sediment samples). As shown in Fig. 21. \n\nSediment samples were collected using Petersen grab samplers as \n\nmentioned before in Chapter ?. \n\nNote: The collection of the samples at Peri Lagoon were possible \n\ndue to a partnership established with Continental Water Ecology \n\nLaboratory from UFSC (Federal University of Santa Catarina), \n\ncoordinated by Prof. Dr. Mauricio Mello Petrucio, who we thank very \n\nmuch for this important collaboration. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n93 \n\n \n\nFigure 21: Location of Peri lagoon and the sampled sites.

For this, in each \n\ncollection, the following physical-chemical parameters were assessed in \n\nsitu by means of Multiparameter probe (YSI-85): water temperature \n\n(TA), conductivity (Cond.), pH and dissolved oxygen (DO). For the \n\nanalyzes of nutrients were done only for samples taken from site 1 \n\n(center of Lagoon), water samples from each collection site, were taken \n\nto the laboratory to determine the amount of nitrite (N.NO2-) \n\n(GOLTERMAN et al., 1978), nitrate (N.NO3-) (MACKERETH et al., \n\n1978), ammonia (N.NH4 +) (KOROLEFF, 1976) and for phosphorus \n\n(these analyzes were carried out in partnership with the Laboratory of \n\nContinental Water Ecology, Department of Ecology and Zoology at \n\nFederal University of Santa Catarina, under the coordination of Prof. Dr. \n\nMauricio Mello Petrucio). \n\n \n\n2.4 Coliphage propagation \n\nTypified strains of somatic coliphages used as positive controls in \n\nthis study:  PhiX174 (Microviridae), phages and their respective \nbacterial hosts were provided by Prof. Dr. Maria Elisa Magri (UFSC, \n\nDept. of Environmental and Sanitary Engineering). \n\n\n\n95 \n\n \n\n2.5 Detection and enumeration of Bacteriophage somatic \n\ncoliphage in surface water and sediment samples \n\nBacteriophages were quantified by a double agar layer technique \n\nfollowing the ISO 10705-2 standard (ISO 2000) for enumeration of \n\nsomatic coliphages (SOMCPH). The volume of water tested for each \n\nphage was 10 mL. The detection limit (DL) as detected by serial dilution \n\nfor somatic coliphage was 10 PFU/100 mL. E. coli ATCC 13706 was \n\nused as the host for somatic coliphage detection according to ISO/FDIS \n\n10705-2. Briefly, the water samples were filtered through a cellulose \n\nester membrane filter, with 0.22 \u00b5m pore size and 47 mm diameter. In \n\ncase of sediment samples, they were diluted first with peptone water \n\n(1:10) and then filtered through a cellulose ester membrane filter. E. coli \n\nC strain ATCC 13706 were grown in modified Scholten\u2019s broth (MSB) \n\nwas used in the quantification of somatic coliphages. To each culture \n\ntube, 1 mL of the original water sample (diluted in case of sediment) \n\nwas added to 1 mL of inoculum culture and 2.5 mL of semi solid \n\nModified Scholtens Agar (ssMSA) heated at 47\u00b0C. The solution was \n\nmixed carefully avoiding the formation of air bubbles and poured on a \n\nlayer of complete solid Modified Scholtens Agar (MSA) prepared \n\npreviously in a 9 cm Petri dish pre-warmed at room temperature. After \n\nsolidification on a horizontal, cool surface, the plates were incubated \n\nupside-down at 36\u00b12 \u00baC for 18\u00b12 h. The results were expressed in \n\nPFU/L. \n\n \n\n2.6 Viral Concentration \n\n2.6.1 Water samples \n\nViral concentrations in the surface water samples were performed \n\nusing the protocol described by KATAYAMA et al., (2002) as \n\ndescribed in chapter ?. \n\n \n\n2.6.2 Sediment samples \nViral concentrations in the sediment samples were performed \n\naccording to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, 1992) \n\nguidelines, with minor modifications as described by SCHLINDWEIN \n\net al. (2010) as described in chapter ?. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n96 \n\n2.7 Extraction of viral nucleic acids \n\n Nucleic acid extractions were performed using a QIAmp MinElute \n\nVirus Spin Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions as \n\ndescribed in in chapter ?. \n\n \n\n2.8 Quantitative PCR assay (qPCR) \nReal time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed as described in \n\nChapter ? and according to HERNROTH et al., (2002); JOTHIKUMAR \n\net al., (2005); and ZENG et al., (2008) for amplification of HAdV, HAV \n\nand RVA. \n\n \n\n2.9 Statistical analyses \n\nTo evaluate the possible correlation between viral detection in \n\nsamples from each point of collection, a Pearson correlation and linear \n\nregression test, a two way ANOVA test and a Student\u2019s t test were \n\nperformed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (USA); data were considered \n\nstatistically significant at a P-value ? 0.05. \n\n \n\n3. RESULTS \n\n3.1 Evaluation of physical-chemical parameters and nutrients \n\nSurface water samples from the Peri Lagoon area were assessed \n\nmonthly over a year, for the following physical-chemical parameters: \n\nwater temperature, conductivity [Cond.], pH and dissolved oxygen [DO] \n\nand nutrients for site 1, Center of Peri Lagoon [Ortho-Phosphate, Total \n\nPhosphate, nitrite (N.NO2-), nitrate (N.NO3-), ammonia (N.NH4 +), and \n\ntotal Nitrogen (TN).  \n\nThe means of the physical-chemical parameters measured for all \n\nsamples from each collection point along one year collections are \n\npresented in Table 4 and as shown in Fig. 26 (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, and \n\nj) and in Fig. 27 (a, b, c, and d).  \n\nAccording to the complete analysis of these parameters, no one \n\nshowed any significant spatial or temporal variation, except DO. For \n\nthis parameter,  in the collections of site 1 at different depths, DO was \n\ncorrelated positively among each point at different depths [surface \n\nwater, 0.9 meter in deep, 5.5 m in deep, 8 m in deep] and this correlation \n\nwas statistically significant (P?0.0001) (Pearson test-ANOVA).  \n\n\n\n97 \n\n \n\nTable 4: Physical-chemical analysis and nutrients for water in each point of

DISCUSSION OF CHAPTERS ? and ?? \n\nWaterborne viral infections are among important causes of human \n\nmorbidity, and related diseases continue to pose public health threat and \n\nsocioeconomic implications worldwide. According to existing reports in \n\nthe literature, there are hundreds of different types of human viruses \n\npresent in human sewage, which can become a source of contamination \n\nof drinking and recreational water. In many countries, water quality is \n\nevaluated according to bacteriological standards, even though bacterial \n\ncontamination is not correlated with the presence of human enteric \n\nviruses and other pathogens (FONG et al., 2005). \n\nMost of waterborne diseases are due to unsafe water supply and \n\ninadequate sanitation. Drinking and recreational water are the main \n\nways of human viral contamination, which can be responsible for \n\nmultiples diseases. Water-related human pathogenic viruses include \n\nHAdV, HNoV, rotaviruses, astroviruses, HAV and HEV (BOFILL-\n\nMAS et al., 2013). Drinking and recreational waters, such as swimming \n\npools and seawater are also contaminated and outbreaks of HAdV \n\ninfection are frequently described in day care centers, hospitals and \n\nother public places (MENA; GERBA, 2008). \n\nCoastal lagoons are important environments for water suppliers and \n\nsanitation processes and are considered an important contributor to \n\nunderground water. Contamination of lagoons with enteric viruses due \n\nto the illegal discharge of domestic sewage represents a significant risk \n\nto public health (MORESCO et al., 2012; ASLAN et al., 2011). In this \n\nstudy, we investigated the presence of human viral pollution (in the \n\nform of HAdV, RVA and HAV) in surface water and sediment over two \n\nyear period (2013, 2014) in order to investigate the role of sediments as \n\nreservoirs for these pathogens and also to see the possible influence of \n\nseasonality in the presence of these viruses.  \n\nReal-time PCR was applied to quantify the presence of HAdV. \n\nHAdV proved to be the most prevalent virus in this study during the two \n\nyears of collection, both in surface water and sediment samples with an \n\nindicated peak in summer collections. \n\nThese results corroborated with other studies, which found that \n\nHAdV is the most prevalent virus in different environmental matrices; \n\nHAdV was detected in 75% of lagoon water samples tested by \n\nRIGOTTO et al., (2010) using nested PCR. Additionally, other studies \n\nhave reported the high incidence of HAdV in different aquatic \n\nenvironments (HUNDESA et al., 2006; CHOO; KIM, 2006; \n\nMIAGOSTOVICH et al., 2008; MORESCO et al., 2012; FONGARO et \n\nal., 2012 and 2013). The lower number of HAdV positive sediment \n\n\n\n111 \n\n \n\nsamples may be due to some obstacles in the method for viral elution in \n\nthese matrices. These methods can interfere with the enzymatic \n\namplification of the nucleic acids in these samples due the presence of \n\ninhibitors (such as humic acids, proteins, organic and inorganic \n\ncompounds) that inhibit amplification of the viral genome target (SANO \n\net al., 2003; ALBINANA-GIMENEZ et al., 2009; SIDHU; TOZE, \n\n2009; ROCK et al., 2010). \n\nHowever, for the positive sediment samples, the number of HAdV \n\nparticles (GC) was two or three logs higher than in water samples \n\n(chapter ?), while the number of HAdV particles (GC) was one or two \n\nlogs higher than in water samples (chapter ??). However this difference \n\nin logs may be due to that Sangradouro River has an illegal dumping of \n\nsewage, from surrounded population. HAdV tends to adsorb onto the \n\nsuspended particles due to its high sorption capacity and its size, which \n\nhas an effect on the interaction processes with the environmental \n\ncolloidal particles (DOWD et al., 1998; WONG et al., 2013).  \n\nDetection of infectious viruses in environmental samples requires the \n\nuse of adequate susceptible cell lines in which the viruses can propagate \n\nand produce cytopathic effects (CPE) (RODR\u00cdGUEZ et al., 2009). As \n\nthe presence of the viral genome does not provide information on \n\ninfectivity, a viability assay was performed to detect the infectious \n\nHAdV particles in the samples containing HAdV nucleic acid. \n\n In Sangradouro River (chapter ?), the majority of HAdV positive \n\nsamples from the summer collection did contain infectious particles, but \n\nany infectious units were detected neither in the surface water nor in \n\nsediment samples from the winter collection from the collection of the \n\nfirst year (2013). The degradation of the viral particles may be due to \n\nvarious factors, such as pH or U.V. light incidence, in addition to other \n\nenvironmental components, such as the presence of proteases, (such as \n\nRNAses, and DNAses), which can influence the resistance and \n\ninactivation of viruses in aquatic environments by causing \n\nconformational changes in the viral capsid (WARD et al., 1986; \n\nBATTIGELLI et al., 1993; CARTER, 2005, FONG; LIPP, 2005, CHOI; \n\nJIANG, 2005, FONGARO et al., 2013). The infectivity test is important \n\nwhen quantitative microbial risk assessment is the goal. To assess \n\npossible damages to the HAdV capsid, which results in a lack of \n\nprotection for the nucleic acids, the DNAse pre-treatment of samples \n\nprior to nucleic acid extraction was applied to all samples analyzed in \n\nthe present work. Previous studies have reported this enzymatic \n\ntechnique as a simple alternative technique to give inferences about \n\n\n\n112 \n\npotential viral infectivity without using laborious cell culture techniques \n\n(RODR\u00cdGUEZ et al., 2009; VIANCELLI et al., 2012; FONGARO et \n\nal., 2013). \n\nThis assay allows for differentiation of undamaged viruses (with \n\nprotected genomes) from damaged viruses (with unprotected genomes) \n\nor even free viral genomes. This assay nevertheless is unable to \n\ndifferentiate inactivated virus with genetic material that is still protected \n\nby viral capsid (RODR\u00cdGUEZ et al., 2009; FONGARO et al., 2013).  \n\nThis limitation was proved in this work, because not all samples \n\ncontaining undamaged HAdV as detected by qPCR were infectious by \n\nplaque assay. The notable differences among these results highlight the \n\ncritical importance of combining, whenever possible, molecular and cell \n\nculture techniques during the monitoring of viruses in the aquatic \n\nenvironment.  \n\nIn Peri Lagoon (chapter ??) HAdV was found to be more prevalent in \n\nwater and sediment samples (64%, and 48%, respectively) than other \n\nenteric viruses detected by qPCR in different aquatic matrices (water \n\nand sediment). High diversity of HAdV in water samples was \n\ndocumented recently by OGORZALY et al., (2015) by using a Next-\n\nGeneration Amplicon Sequencing (NGS) Approach. This virus proved \n\nto be prevalent in the water samples collected during the first one year \n\nof monitoring with an indicated peak in summer collections which \n\ncoincides with summer holiday period and a high increasement of the \n\nfluctuant population. These results corroborated with other studies from \n\nour and other groups (GENTHE et al., 1995; WONG et al., 2009; \n\nRIGOTTO et al., 2010; MORESCO et al., 2012; FONGARO et al., \n\n2012; GARCIA et al., 2012). The viral load in water samples ranged \n\nfrom 10\n5\n GC/L to 10\n\n7\n GC/L. The detection frequency found in the \n\npresent study was nearly equal in comparison to previous studies related \n\nto surface water: done by FONGARO et al., (2012) (10\n6\n to 10\n\n8\n GC/L), \n\nand by GARCIA et al., (2012) (average of 10\n7\n GC/L). However, other \n\nstudies reported viral loads lower in 2 or 3 logs from those presented \n\nhere in surface water: YE et al., (2012) (10\n2\n\u201310\n\n4\n GC/L), CHOI and \n\nJIANG (2005) (10\n2\n\u201310\n\n4\n GC/L), HARAMOTO et al., (2010) (10\n\n3\n\u201310\n\n5\n \n\nGC/L), JURZIK et al., (2010) (10\n3\n\u201310\n\n5\n GC/L). \n\nIn Peri Lagoon (chapter ??), a higher positivity of infectious HAdV \n\nwas noted in sediment samples than in water samples (83% and 76%, \n\nrespectively). The viral load for HAdV was almost the same in both \n\nmatrices (water and sediment) ranging from 10\n2\n to 10\n\n4\n PFU/L and 10\n\n2\n to \n\n10\n3 \n\nPFU/Kg, respectively. HAdV load detected by STAGGEMEIER et \n\nal., (2015) was 3 times higher in sediment samples than in water and this \n\n\n\n113 \n\n \n\ndifference may be due to the detection technique used (ICC-RT-qPCR) \n\nwhich is more sensitive than plaque assay and able to detect HAdV as \n\nlow as 1?\u00d7?10\n2\n genome copies per milliliter of infectious viral particles in \n\nthe environmental water samples according to FONGARO et al., (2013) \n\nand this reinforce the idea about the combining of molecular and cell \n\nculture technique during the monitoring of viruses in the aquatic \n\nenvironment to maintain a reliable result for public health. \n\nHAdV have been indicated as potential marker of viral \n\ncontamination in water (CALGUA et al., 2008; BOSCH et al., 2011; \n\nWYN-JONES et al., 2011; WYER et al., 2012) since this virus has \n\nDNA genome, which confers more resistance to environmental \n\nstressors, such as UV radiation, temperature, chlorine concentration and \n\npH variation, including sewage treatment procedures \n\n(LECHEVALLIER; AU, 2004; FONG; LIPP, 2005), moreover, HAdV \n\nwere found to be more prevalent than other enteric viruses (WONG et \n\nal., 2009; WYN-JONES et al., 2011; GARCIA et al., 2012, FONGARO \n\net al., 2012; MORESCO et al., 2012). \n\nOn the other hand, there are several candidate viral indicators to \n\npredict virus contamination in environmental waters. Several studies \n\nindicate that bacteriophages could serve as viral indicator for estimating \n\nenteric viruses in water (HAVELAAR, 1993). Three groups of \n\nbacteriophages have been proposed as potential viral indicators for \n\nestimating sewage contamination and human enteric viruses in water \n\nbased on their similarities to human enteric viruses in morphology, \n\nnucleic acid composition, sources and occurrence in contaminated \n\nwater: F-specific RNA coliphage, phages of Bacteroides fragilis, and \n\nsomatic coliphages. \n\nIn chapter ??, we investigated the presence of somatic coliphages in \n\nwater and sediments over one year monitoring, to see the possible \n\ninfluence of seasonality in the presence of these viruses and also to \n\nshow a possible correlation between them (somatic coliphage and DNA \n\n&amp; RNA viruses in this study).  \n\nIn our study (chapter ??), somatic coliphage proved to be prevalent \n\nduring the winter and spring seasons along one year of collection and it \n\nwas completely absent during the summer season. This may be due to \n\nthe concentration of environmental phage populations. Several authors \n\nhave unsuccessfully tried to isolate phages through direct methods, and \n\nothers, although occasionally successful, but did not publish their \n\nfindings (ACKERMANN, 1997). \n\n\n\n114 \n\nAll of the positive samples for somatic coliphages by double agar \n\nlayer method showed to be positive for the presence of E. coli. However \n\nthere is no positive correlation was found between human adenoviruses \n\nquantified by real-time PCR or by plaque assay and culturable \n\ncoliphages, indicating that the detected adenoviruses might be originated \n\nby human feces and respiratory secretions while coliphages might be \n\ngenerated by other natural sources such as birds, animal feces, and/or \n\nregrowth in nutrient-rich soil (DESMARAIS et al., 2002). Our data \n\nconfirm findings from other studies made in different regions of the \n\nworld; JIANG et al., (2001) reported the presence of HAdV (by nested \n\nPCR) and culturable coliphages in coastal waters of Southern California \n\nin four site of collection and they noted that the presence of human \n\nadenovirus was not significantly correlated with the concentration of \n\ncoliphage; GRIFFIN et al., (1999), detected human enteric virus \n\n(polioviruses, coxsackie A and B viruses, echoviruses, hepatitis A \n\nviruses, Norwalk viruses, and small round-structured viruses) in 95% of \n\nsamples collected from Florida coastal water by PCR whereas a few or \n\nno coliphage was detected in their samples; while CHUNG et al., (1998) \n\nreported a significant association of F-specific phage with human enteric \n\nviruses in oysters and their harvest waters. By using real time PCR, \n\nCHOI; JIANG (2005) made a study on two urban rivers in California \n\nand JURZIK et al., (2010) made a study on river Ruher, Germany and \n\nthey found no significant correlations between HAdV and culturable \n\ncoliphages. \n\nThe RVA was present in 33% of water and 19% of sediment samples \n\ncollected in Peri Lagoon and 33.2% of water and 10.4% of sediment \n\nsamples collected in Sangradouro River, suggesting a cross \n\ncontamination with human sewage in both environments. Rotavirus is \n\nthe most common cause of severe diarrheal diseases in infants and \n\nyoung children worldwide causing > 600,000 deaths each year under 5 \n\nyears of age and can be shedding in high concentration in the feces of \n\ninfected persons (>10\n10 \n\nvirus particle/g) with a small infectious dose \n\n<100 virus particles. Many studies demonstrated a high prevalence of \n\nRV in different matrices as following, in the sewage: MELEG et al., \n\n(2008) (91%); RODRIGUEZ-DIAZ et al., (2009) (67%), FUMIAN et \n\nal., (2010 and 2011) (47%, 100%); in the river contaminated with \n\nsewage: RODRIGUEZ-DIAZ et al., (2009)(83%); in stream waters: \n\nMIAGOSTOVICH et al., (2008) (44%); in the surface water of river and \n\nlagoon: HAMZA et al., (2009) (90%), JURZIK et al., 2010 (64%), \n\nFONGARO et al., (2012) (65%),and in fluffy sediment: RAO et al., \n\n(1986) (40%). \n\n\n\n115 \n\n \n\nHowever, the low incidence of these RNA viruses in sediment \n\nsamples may be due to their weak absorption on sediment particles or \n\ndue to their quick inactivation in sediments. Previous studies that \n\nreported the incidence of rotavirus in sediments done by CHUNG; \n\nSOBSEY (1993) and GREEN; LEWIS (1999) also demonstrated a low \n\nincidence (12.5%) and suggested that the viral adsorption to sediment \n\nmay inactivate this virus. However, these authors reported a high \n\nincidence of HAV in sediment samples contaminated by wastewater \n\n(87.5%). Other studies regarding HAV incidence in Brazil have also \n\nshown a low incidence in environmental samples (RIGOTTO et al., \n\n2010).  \n\nIn Brazil, attenuated G1P[8] vaccine, Rotarix (GlaxoSmithKline, \n\nRixensart, Belgium), was included in the Immunization Program since \n\n2006 (FUMIAN et al., 2011). However a recent study done by \n\nGUERRA et al., (2015) noted that G2P[4] was the predominant RV \n\nstrain circulating in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil and detected in 57.2% of circulating \n\nstrains over their whole study period (three years) which suggests a shift \n\nin genotype distribution since 2006 (CARVALHO-COSTA et al., 2009, \n\nGUERRA et al., 2015). These data make the continuous RV genotyping \n\nmonitoring is needed for discovering others shifting. \n\nOther reports demonstrated a low incidence of HAV in different \n\nenvironmental samples in lagoon water:  RIGOTTO et al., (2010) \n\n(17%), FONGARO et al., (2012) (12%); in sewage: FORMIGA-\n\nCRUZ et al., (2005) (20%); in raw and treated sewage in Brazil: \n\nVILLAR et al., (2007) (32%). However in one study done at the Buffalo \n\nRiver, South Africa by CHIGOR; OKON (2012), HAV was the most \n\nprevalent detected viruses with 43% of positivity. Our results suggested \n\nthat there is a possible contamination route via human sewage for Peri \n\nLagoon (the present studied area) or even this contamination can be due \n\nto recreational activities such as bathing in these areas during vacation \n\nperiod. Moreover, no samples have been found positive for HAV in \n\nsediments.  \n\nThe detection and quantification of enteric viruses in matrices \n\nreported in these chapters support the idea related to solid-associated \n\nviruses and its importance to take in consideration during a routine \n\nmonitoring of the aquatic environment to reduce the risk of illness from \n\nenteric viruses. Many authors in the literature found that viral abundance \n\nin sediment exceeds that in the water column by an order of magnitude \n\n(DANOVARO et al., 2002; DANOVARO; MIDDELBOE, 2010). Also \n\nStatistical analysis revealed no significant correlations between the \n\n\n\n116 \n\nphysicochemical parameters with the presence of these viruses and these \n\nfinding were confirmed by other reports in the literature (LEE et al., \n\n2013; VECCHIA et al., 2015). \n\nThe high prevalence of HAdV in the surface water and sediment \n\nsamples along two years of monitoring indicates that there was no \n\nseasonal difference. So, the prevalence of HAdVs is ubiquitous in the \n\nenvironment all year round, a result that has been confirmed by other \n\nstudies done by FORMIGA-CRUZ et al., (2005) and RIGOTTO et al., \n\n(2010). This high incidence may be due to the high stability of HAdV in \n\nthe aquatic environment and its sporadic shedding in the faeces of most \n\nadults (WYN-JONES et al., 2009). Regarding somatic coliphage we \n\nnoted a higher incidence during winter months along our study in the \n\nsecond year of collections.  \n\nRVA showed a marked winter seasonal peak in water (45.5% in \n\n[chapter ?], 62% [chapter ??]) as well as sediment samples (12.5% \n\n[chapter ?], 33% [chapter ??] ), which has also been reported in previous \n\nstudies (COOK et al., 1990; LEVY et al., 2009; PAYNE et al., 2011, \n\nCHIGOR; OKOH, 2012). Some authors had demonstrated higher levels \n\nof RVA during the cold, drier months (STEELE; GLASS, 2011), while \n\nothers suggested that this seasonal pattern may vary according to the \n\nRVA serotype (SARKAR et al., 2008; JAGAI et al., 2012). \n\nHowever, the seasonal prevalence of these viruses was not \n\nstatistically significant. In the present study, HAV displayed a higher \n\nincidence during the summer (45.8% [chapter ?], 52% [chapter ??]). \n\nHowever, CHIGOR; OKOH, (2012) reported higher detection of HAV \n\nin South Africa during the winter and spring seasons (43%). Another \n\nstudy performed in Brazil by RIGOTTO et al., (2010) documented a \n\nseasonal pattern for HAV during the spring and winter seasons, with a \n\nhigh incidence during the months of October and July. Another study \n\ndone in Rio de Janeiro by VILLAR et al., (2002) reported a peak of \n\nHAV incidence during hot and rainy months. However, we must take \n\ninto consideration the fact that many cases are underreported and others \n\nare asymptomatic.  \nDistribution of aquatic microbial organisms in the water column can \n\nbe varied depending of varies factors such as: their velocity of settling \n\nand wind, suspended solids in water column, presence of anaerobic or \n\naerobic predators and also for the intensity of natural sunlight through \n\nthe water column. HAdV was detected in the present study in the \n\nsurface water and in all depths of water column (0.9m, 5.5m, and 8m), \n\nthis may be due to nucleic acid nature of this virus that increase \n\nits resistance to various environmental factors such as UV radiation and \n\n\n\n117 \n\n \n\ntemperature which are known to cause conformational changes in the \n\nviral capsid (SIRIKANCHANA et al., 2008; EISCHEID et al., 2009). \n\nWhile RVA, HAV, and somatic coliphage were shown to have a high \n\nincrease with depth from the surface towards while they have a slightly \n\npresence in the surface water of the centre of Peri lagoon. Therefore, the \n\nlagoon centre deep offers stable environments for some microbial life \n\nthroughout water layers. While the other three collections sites in the \n\npresent study we could see this difference because of maximum deep is \n\naround 1.5m. The vertical patterns observed in this study for the \n\ndetected enteric viruses imply that throughout the depths of water \n\ncolumn the loss of these pathogens should be low because of the \n\ndarkness and lower temperature (MURRAY; JACKSON 1993; HARA \n\net al., 1996; COLOMBET et al., 2006). However, there is no \n\ninformation available in the literature about the presence and \n\ndistributions of enteric viruses throughout different depths of water \n\ncolumn. But these results forced us to make a prospective study using \n\ndifferent microcosm seeded artificially by different enteric viruses in \n\ndifferent realistic exposure conditions for natural sunlight and dark \n\ncondition. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n118 \n\n5. CONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\n-The results showed that in the Island of Florianopolis, recreational \n\nwaters and lagoons, which are the main resources for drinking water, are \n\nbeing contaminated by enteric viruses, either by sewage runoff or by its \n\nstreams and interconnections.  \n\n \n\n-This study highlighted the importance of HAdV as viral indicator \n\nparameter in addition to bacteriological parameters in the monitoring of \n\nrecreational water microbiologically. Also RV, HAV, HAdV and \n\nSOMCPH should be indexed for human fecal pollution in estuarine \n\nsediments as the only refuge of solid associated viruses, \n\n \n\n- SOMCPH in our study, did not shown a good performance as  \n\nindicator for the presence of viral contamination in water samples,  \n\n \n\n-The results highlighted the importance of evaluating the ecosystem \n\ninterconnections of Sangradouro River in order to enhance the safety of \n\nwater as a drinking and recreational resource in this environment. This \n\nwater may otherwise pose a threat to the population that is mainly \n\nresponsible for the degradation of its quality in this lagoon and \n\nneighborhood.  \n\n \n\n-The HAdV integrity test by enzymatic treatment (DNAse I) is a less \n\nlaborious method than cell culture technique and proved to be feasible to \n\ndetect potentially infectious viral particles; \n\n \n\n-The sediments also proved to act as shelter for enteric viruses, \n\nincreasing their concentrations and being responsible for the return of \n\nthese pathogens to the water column when resuspended. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n119 \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \nACKERMANN H.

INTRODUCTION  \nThis chapter will present and discuss the results of HAdV and MNV-\n\n1 stability in laboratory scale microcosms kept under two conditions: \n\nnatural condition receiving natural sun light and full dark condition. To \n\nprepare the microcosms we used surface water and sediment samples \n\ncatched at Peri Lagoon.  \n\n \n\n2. MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n2.1 Collection of samples \nSurface water and sediment samples were collected at the center of \n\nPeri Lagoon (site 1 as described in Chapter ??), Florianopolis, Santa \n\nCatarina State, Brazil (July, 2014). \n\n \n\n2.2 Physical-chemical analysis \nWater temperature (WT), conductivity (Cond), pH, and dissolved \n\noxygen (DO) were measured in situ with specific probes (WTW-\n\nMulti350i) for all of samples after collection, as outlined in the standard \n\nmethods for the examination of water and wastewater described by the \n\nAmerican Public Health Association (APHA, 1998). Water samples \n\nwere taken to the laboratory to quantify Ortho-Phosphate (PO4), Total \n\nPhosphate (TP), Nitrite (NO2.N), nitrate (NO3.N), ammonium nitrogen \n\n(NH4.N), and total Nitrogen (TN) were determined in filtered water \n\nsamples using a Millipore AP40\u201347 mm glass fiber (GOLTERMAN et \n\nal., 1978; KOROLEFF, 1976) (these analyzes were carried out in \n\npartnership with the Laboratory of Continental Water Ecology, \n\nDepartment of Ecology and Zoology at the Federal University of Santa \n\nCatarina, under the coordination of Prof. Dr. Mauricio Mello Petrucio). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3 Recombinant Adenovirus as a model for DNA enteric viruses  \nRecombinant human adenovirus (rHAdV) which was used in this \n\nchapter is related to serotype 5 but has some modification in its genome \n\nregion. E1 gene (E1A and E1B) was removed and replaced by the gene \n\nof green fluorescent protein (GFP). HEK 293A (cell line of human \n\nembryonic kidney) was genetically transformed to express the viral \n\nprotein E1 as shown in Fig. 36, thereby this cell line is susceptible and \n\npermissive to rAdV. Therefore when rAdV replicate, GFP is transcribed \n\nalong with the virus genome emitting a green fluorescence that can be \n\neasily detected by fluorescence microscope (DAN et al., 2010; \n\n\n\n133 \n\n \n\nWEAVER; KADAN, 2000). By using this model of recombinant \n\nadenovirus, there is no need for further immunologic methods making \n\nthis model more rapid, inexpensive, and more specific (LI, HE, JIANG, \n\n2010). However in the literature there are few studies related to the \n\nstability and infectivity of HAdV in the aquatic environment using \n\nrHAdV. (GARCIA et al., 2015; NASCIMENTO, et al., 2015). \n\n \nFigure 36: Schematic structure of human recombinant adenoviruses (rHAdV) \n\nrelated to serotype 5, composed by the green fluorescence protein (GFP) gene \n\nincorporated and genetically transformation of HEK293A to express the viral \n\nE1 protein \n\n \nSource: Author \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4 Cell lines and preparation of viral stock of rHAdV, and MNV-1 \n\nfor seeding experiment in water and sediment samples  \nThe cell lines HEK 293 (human embryonic kidney) and RAW 264-7 \n\n(Mus musculus, mouse macrophages), permissive to rHAdV and MNV-\n\n1, respectively were used for the experiments. Both were cultivated in \n\nsterile cell culture flasks (75cm\n2\n), with Dulbecco's Minimum Essential \n\nMedium Eagle`s salts (DMEM) (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal \n\nbovine serum (FBS) and 1% HEPES, until they reached confluence (24 \n\nh, 37 \u00baC, and 5% CO2). Then the growth media was removed and 1.0 \n\nmL for each viral suspension was inoculated separately in each cell \nculture flask. After 1h for viral adsorption at 37\u00b0C, 20 mL of cell \n\nmaintenance media were added consisting of the same growth medium, \n\nbut with 2% FBS. Cell cultures were always monitored and compared \n\nwith an uninfected control cell for checking the appearance of \n\n\n\n134 \n\ncytopathic effect (CPE). In case of rHAdV, the cells were monitored \n\nevery day, and observed using an inverted fluorescence microscope \n\nwhich allowed the visualization of cells with green fluorescence (GFP) \n\ndue to transcription and translation of GFP protein, which means viral \n\nreplication. In case of MNV-1, the cells were observed under inverted \n\nmicroscope until reach 100% of cytopathic effect (CPE), characterized \n\nby rounded cells and even detachment from the surface, destroying the \n\ncell monolayer. \n\nThe cell culture flasks that contain infected cells with rHAdV or \n\nMNV-1 were then frozen at -80 \u00b0C and thawed at 25\u00b0C three times for \n\ncell lysis. Then, the virus suspension was transferred, separately to a \n\ntube and centrifuged at 3,500 ?g for 4 min. at 4\u00b0C to remove the cells \n\ndebris and separate the supernatant. The supernatants were then used to \n\ninfect other flasks with the appropriated cells in order to expand the \n\namount of virus stocks to be used for the further experiments.   \n\n \n\n2.5 Cytotoxicity assay  \n\nThe cytotoxicity of surface water and sediment samples were \n\nevaluated either on HEK 293 or in RAW 264-7 cells. These cells were \n\npropagated in sterile 24-well plates at a density of 2.5 \u00d7 10\n5\n and 1\u00d7 10\n\n6\n \n\ncells per well, respectively. Surface water and sediment samples were \n\npretreated with 1% antibiotic/antifungal (100 U penicillin G / mL / \n\nstreptomycin 100 ?g /mL amphotericin B 0.25 ?g /mL) and diluted in \n\n1X DMEM in the following proportions: 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:8. An inoculum \n\nof 100 ?L of each dilution in triplicate was placed in contact with each \n\ntype of tested cells for 1h at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2 atmosphere and \n\nuniform mixing every 15 min. Subsequently, the inoculum was removed \n\nand 1 mL of DMEM containing 1% PSA was added to the cells, two cell \n\ncontrols were maintained for each plate and these cells contained only \n\nmedium. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 atmosphere and \n\nthe cells monolayer was monitored for 3 days in case of RAW 264-7 \n\ncells and only one day in case of HEK 293. \n\nCells containing inoculated test samples were compared with control \n\ncell under a light microscope. Sequentially, cells were fixed and stained \n\nwith 300?L of Naphthalene Black solution (0.1% Naphthalene Black, \n\n5% Acetic Acid, pH 2.3-2.4). The cell monolayer was stained and \n\nexamined for the non-cytotoxic dilution, for each of tested samples in \n\norder to be further used for infectivity assays. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n135 \n\n \n\n2.6 Monitoring the infectivity of rHAdV in surface water and \n\nsediment samples by Fluorescence microscopy (FM) \n\nThese cells were previously cultivated in 48-well tissue culture plates \n\nat a density of 2.5 \u00d7 10\n5\n cells / well, with Dulbecco's Minimum Essential \n\nMedium Eagle`s salts (DMEM) (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS \n\nand 1% HEPES, until they reached confluence and were incubated at \n\n37\u00b0C under 5% CO2 for 24 h. Then 100 \u00b5L viral fluids as a positive \n\ncontrol or sample were tested using non-cytotoxic dilutions. The \n\nsamples were serially diluted (10 fold) previously as following: for viral \n\nfluid 50 \u00b5L viruses were diluted in 450 \u00b5L of DMEM 1X until 10\n-5\n\n. \n\nRegarding the samples, 50 \u00b5L were diluted with 450 \u00b5L of 1X DMEM \n\nwith 1% PSA and serially diluted until 10\n-5\n\n. In the cell control wells \n\n(negative control) was added only DMEM 1X. After 1h at 37\u00b0C under \n\n5% CO2, 0.4 mL of maintenance medium was added per well (1X \n\nDMEM, 2% FBS, 1% HEPES and 1% PSA) to 48 plate wells. After 24 \n\nh the cell supernatant was aspirated and the plate was visualized directly \n\nunder inverted fluorescence microscope. The number of fluorescent \n\ncells in the highest possible dilution was counted and the viral titer \n\nexpressed in focus forming units (FFU/mL) according to the following \n\nformula: \n\n \n\n N. of fluorescence cell (average of triplicate) x Reciprocal \n\ndilution \n\n \n\nVolume of inoculum in each well (mL) \n\nThe detection limit of the technique was established according to the \n\nhighest dilution where it was possible to count the infected cells. \n\n \n\n2.7 Study of the infectivity of MNV-1 in surface water and sediment \n\nsamples by plaque assay \n\nThese cells were previously cultivated in 6-well tissue culture plates \n\nat a density of 1 \u00d7 10\n6\n cells / well, with Dulbecco's Minimum Essential \n\nMedium Eagle`s salts (DMEM) (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal \n\nbovine serum (FBS) and 1% HEPES, until they reached confluence and \n\nwere incubated at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2 for 24 h. The plaque assay for the \n\nMNV-1 was based on the protocol described by BAE; SCHWAB, \n\n(2008). Briefly, 400 \u00b5L of viral fluid or sample in non-cytotoxic dilution \nwere inoculated and incubated for viral adsorption as described above.  \n\nThe inoculum was removed and added the cell culture maintenance (2x \n\nMEM), diluted in melted agarose 3% (SeaPlaque Agarose low melting \n\npoint, Lonza, CA, USA) in order to prevent the virus from spreading, \n\n\n\n136 \n\nlimiting the infection only to neighboring cells that were primarily \n\ninfected. Cells were incubated for 48h at 37\u00b0C. After this period, 1.0 mL \n\nof a 0.1% solution of neutral red dye was overlaid on the agarose layer, \n\nwhich enabled the visualization of lysis plaques and its count after 3h as \n\nshown in Fig. 37 (a, b). The number of plaque units in the highest \n\npossible dilution was counted and the viral titer expressed in plaque \n\nforming units (PFU/mL) defined by the following formula:  \n\n \n\n N. of plaques (average of duplicate) x Reciprocal \n\ndilution \n\n \n\nVolume of inoculum in each well (mL) \n\nThe technique detection limit was established according to the \n\nhighest dilution where it can perform plate count. \n\n \nFigure 37: Illustrative picture of Plaque assay for MNV-1 (A), aspect of the \n\nplaque forming unit (B). \n\n \nSource: Author \n\n2.8 Microcosm design and sampling \nExperiments were set-up in microcosms in a glass container \n\n(NADER-Brazil, 50 mL) filled with a sediment layer of 5 cm and an \n\noverlying water column of 5 cm as shown in Fig. 38. The microcosms \n\nwere stored in two conditions: i) Dark environment (24 h dark); ii) \n\nNatural environment (+/-12 h of natural sunlight/+/-12 h of dark moon \n\nlight). The microcosms were kept until 85 days starting at 19, September \n\n2014 and finishing at 13, December 2014. Microcosms were sampled in \n\ntriplicates at period\u2019s intervals for up to 85 days as shown in Fig. 38. \n\nAlso triplicate samples were taken for each microcosm. Infectivity \n\nstudies were undertaken with rAdV, and MNV-1 and the tests were \n\nrevealed by fluorescence microscopy and plaque assay, respectively. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n137 \n\n \n\nFigure 38: Flow chart showing the basic experimental design for microcosms \n\nestablishment \n\n \n \n\n2.9 Inoculation of microcosms \n\nStock viral suspensions were prepared as mentioned before either for \n\nrHADV (2 \u00d7 10\n7\n FFU/mL) or MNV-1 (5 \u00d7 10\n\n6\n PFU/mL). One milliliter \n\nfrom each viral stock was inoculated in each microcosm jointly and \n\nmixed during 5 min for homogenization and 1h for proper settling. Then \n\nhalf numbers of the microcosms were placed in dark condition (24 h) \n\nand the other half were placed in natural condition (+/-12 h of natural \n\nsunlight/+/-12 h of dark moon light). Three microcosms were used to \n\ndetermine the initial titer of inoculated viruses before start the \n\nexperiment, 1 h after inoculation. \n\nBoth sediment and water from the microcosm were analyzed on days \n\n0 (1 h after initial inoculation), 1, 3, 7, 15, 30, 60, 70 and 85 days. Three \n\nmicrocosms were removed per time point with triplicate samples \n\nassayed from each as shown in Fig. 39. \n\nFor each analysis, overlying water was removed and going directly \n\nfor analysis with non-cytotoxic dilution. While sediment samples were \n\nobtained by first removing the remaining overlying water and going for \n\nelution step as already described. Temperature was taken for each \n\ncollection sample during the experiments. \n\nThe decay rate constant (k), that means, the decrease in viral \n\nconcentration over time, was calculated as the slope of the line when \n\nlog10 (Nt / N0) was regressed against time, where Nt is the number of \n\neach virus at time t and N0 is the number of virus at time 24 h The decay \n\n\n\n138 \n\nrate constant value (k) could then be used to calculate T90 value, which \n\nare the times required for a 1 log10 reduction in viral concentration. \n\n \nFigure 39: Laboratory scale microcosm setup for 85 days, using a dark \n\nenvironment (a), natural environment (b), and the settling process during the \n\nfirst 24 h (c). Showing the replicate for each collection time \n\n \nSource: Author \n\n \n\n2.10 Direct elution of viruses from sediment samples \nAfter removal of water samples from each microcosm, the sediment \n\nwas gently diluted in 20 mL of modified Eagle's minimal essential \n\nmedium (E-MEM) (pH=11.5) as described by STAGGEMEIER et al., \n\n(2014). The solution was homogenized by vigorous agitation (vortex) \n\nfor 1 h and then centrifuged at 2.000 \u00d7 g for 10 min. The supernatant \n\nwas then used for further investigation. In case of water samples, they \n\nwere used directly without any concentration or elution methods. Also \n\nall water and sediment samples that were collected from Peri Lagoon \n\nwere concentrated as described in Chapter ? to assess the presence or \n\nabsence of HAdV genome copies by qPCR before starting the set-up of \n\nthe microcosms. \n\n \n\n2.11 Statistical analyses and modelling \nAll analyses were undertaken in triplicate and expressed as the mean \n\n\u00b1 standard deviation. Slopes of the lines from linear regression (The \n\ntime for a decimal reduction of viruses, T90) were calculated considering \n\nlinear regression curves, using Microsoft Excel. Statistical two-way \n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093414004492\n\n\n139 \n\n \n\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to evaluate differences \n\nbetween viruses concentrations in the overlaying water compared with \n\nthe sediment layer for microcosm experiments. The Pearson correlation \n\nwas applied to evaluate positive or negative correlations between viral \n\ninfectivity and light or dark condition (GraphPad Prism 5.0). The critical \n\nP-value for the test was set at&lt;0.05. \n \n\n3.

Water and sediment samples \n\n(after elution method as described above) were diluted serially and \n\ninoculated on cell lines. Dilution 1:4 either for water or sediment \n\nsamples showed no morphological changes in cell lines when compared \n\nto the control cell (only cell and medium). Thus this dilution (1:4) was \n\nthe minimum dilution which was used in all samples inoculated in cell \n\nlines during microcosm experiments. \n\n \n\n3.4 Infectivity reductions in human viruses \n\n3.4.1 Recombinant Human Adenovirus (rHAdV) \n\nThe time course of decay in natural system for rHAdV are shown in \n\nFig. 40 (a), where, as expected, effect of temperature and natural UV \n\nlight on viral stabilities was observed. Temperature index along the \n\nlaboratory scale microcosm was measured as shown in Fig. 41. After 15 \n\ndays, rHAdV lost its infectivity in about 2.2 log10 (2.13 \u00d7 10\n2\n FFU/mL) \n\nin overlaying water, about 2.6 log10 (4 \u00d7 10\n2\n FFU/mL) in sediment, after \n\n30 days we could not detect any fluorescent cells in both matrices (water \n\nand sediment).   \n\nIn dark system, for sediment, rHAdV decay rates were lower and \n\ndecreased along the time course. We could detect infected fluorescent \n\ncells until 70 days with a log reduction of about 2.8 log10 (2.7\u00d7 10\n2\n \n\nFFU/mL) for sediment. While in overlaying water column, the viral \n\nreduction was 2.5 logs10 (1.2\u00d7 10\n2\n FFU/mL) after 60 days; after 70 days \n\nwe could not detect any fluorescent cells (below of detection limit). The \n\nlog10 reduction values were taken based on virus concentration detected \n\nafter 24 h of settling process for virus after inoculation as shown in Fig. \n\n40 (b). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n141 \n\n \n\nFigure 40: Survival and log10 reduction of rHAdV in natural environment (a) \n\nand full dark environment (b). \n\na)  \n\n \n \n\nb) \n\n \n\n\n\n142 \n\nFigure 41: Temperature index along 85 days for a laboratory scale microcosm \n\nlocated in the open environment, a) Maximum and Minimum of temperature \n\n[year 2014, adapted from website: weather and climate.com], and b) \n\ntemperature index for the experiment (85 days), where (?) refers to the \n\ncollection day for each microcosm. \n\n \n3.4.2 Murine norovirus (MNV-1) \n\nThe time course of decay in natural environment for MNV-1 is \n\nshown in Fig. 42 (a). After 15 days, MNV-1 infectivity lost about 3 \n\nlogs10 (7.5\u00d7 10\n1\n PFU/mL and 5.9\u00d7 10\n\n1\n PFU/mL) either in water or \n\nsediment, respectively. After 30 days, we could not detect more \n\ninfectious units by plaque assay in both matrices. These results pointed \n\nto the effect of temperature and natural U.V. light on viral stability and \n\ninfectivity. \n\nIn dark system, in water column we could detect an average of 1.4 \u00d7 \n\n10\n3\n PFU/mL of MNV-1 (about 1.7 log10 reduction) after 30 days and the \n\ninfectivity was lost completely after 60 days. Contrary, MNV-1 was \n\ndetected in the sediment along the time course of experiment until only \n\n70 days with logs reduction of about 2.7 log10. The log reduction values \n\n\n\n143 \n\n \n\nwere analyzed based on virus concentration detected after 24 h of \n\nsettling process for virus after inoculation as shown in Fig. 42 (b). \n\n. \nFigure 42: Survival and log10 reduction of MNV-1 in natural environment (a) \n\nand dark environment (b). \n\n \n\na) \n\n \n \n\nb) \n\n \n\n\n\n144 \n\nTo estimate the required time to inactivate 90% of virus (T90) in \n\nwater and sediment either in natural or full dark environment, the \n\nobtained results from microcosms were adjusted.

In \n\nsediment, T90-natural condition was 7 and 6.4 days, respectively. \n\nContrary, T90-full dark condition for rHAdV and MNV-1 in water \n\ncolumn was 20.9 and 12, respectively. While in sediment, T90-full dark \n\ncondition was 22.7 days for rHAdV as shown in Fig. 44 (a, b), and 18.6 \ndays for MNV-1 as shown in Fig. 45 (a, b).

DISCUSSION \n\nThis study examined the decay of two types of enteric viruses\u2019 \n\nrHAdV, and MNV-1 in dark and natural condition. Over 85 days of \n\nmicrocosms sampling period, we monitored the decay rate for two types \n\nof viruses rHAdV and MNV-1 (representing DNA and RNA genomes \n\nenteric viruses) that had been artificially inoculated with different initial \n\nconcentrations at the same volume (1mL): 2 \u00d7 10\n7 \n\nFFU/mL and 5 \u00d7 10\n6\n \n\nPFU/mL for rHAdV and MNV-1, respectively. For rHAdV, all \n\nexperiments exhibited a similar pattern of settling over the initial 24 h \n\nafter direct inoculation; while for MNV-1 the settling process was not \n\nuniform. This difference may reflect the intrinsic differences between \n\nadsorption processes for DNA and RNA viruses which rely on many \n\nfactors such as size and shape of virus, surface charge and hydrophobic \n\ninteractions, which may lead to variation in settling velocities and/or \n\nassociation with sediment particles (Wong et al., 2012). \n\nOur results using microcosms, illustrated the extended persistence of \n\nviruses in sediments compared with overlaying water column in dark \n\nconditions. In the natural conditions, after the initial peak of settling, the \n\nconcentration of rHAdV in the water and sediment decreased \n\ndramatically in a relatively short period of time 15 days which decreased \n\nby 2.2 and 2.6 orders of magnitude, respectively. After 30 days we \n\ncould not detect more rHAdV infectious particles, since the FFU for \n\nrHAdV was below the limit of detection until the end of the experiment \n\nusing fluorescence microscope. \n\nThe same happened for MNV-1 which decreased about 3 orders of \n\nmagnitude after 15 days. After 30 days we also could not detect more \n\nMNV-1 infectious particles where PFU for MNV-1 was below the limit \n\nof detection until the end of the experiment using plaque assay. \n\nHowever, in dark conditions, a similar time course of viral decay has \n\nbeen observed for rHAdV and MNV either in water or sediment \n\nsamples, where infectious particles for rHAdV was detected until 60 and \n\n75 days in water and sediment, respectively with log10 reduction \n\ndecreased by 2.5 and 2.8 orders of magnitude in tested matrices, \n\nrespectively. The FFU for rHAdV was no longer detectable after 70 and \n\n85 days either in overlaying water or sediment, respectively. However, \n\nthe reduction in infectivity of rHAdV reached 4.5 and 5.2 log10 in 70 \n\nand 85 days in both matrices (water and sediment), respectively. \n\nWhile infectious particles for MNV-1 was detected only until 30 and \n\n75 days in water and sediment, respectively. This decreased was 1.7 and \n\n2.7 orders of magnitude in tested matrices, respectively. The MNV-1 \n\nPFU was no longer detectable after 60 days in water and after 85 days in \n\n\n\n149 \n\n \n\nsediment where the reduction of infectivity of MNV-1 reached 4.8 log10 \n\nin each of them. \n\n It is well known that viruses with a DNA double-stranded genome \n\nare more stable than those whose genome are RNA single-stranded like \n\nMNV-1 (ESPINOSA et al., 2008).  However, the stability of MNV-1 \n\nwhich is ss-RNA, nonenveloped norovirus was comparable with \n\nstability of rAdV in current study (until 15 days of collection). A study \n\ndone by KATPALLY et al., (2008), has reported that MNV may \n\nundergo a capsid maturation process, where the mature state may be \n\nmore stable, which may account the stability of  MNV-1 in the present \n\nstudy until 15 days in overlaying water and sediment samples with only \n\n0.4 log10 reduction. Many studies in the literature are described \n\nregarding the stability of enteric viruses in different aquatic environment \n\nwith conflicting results. Ground water: OGORZALY et al., (2010) they \n\ndetected adenoviruses-2 throughout 120 days, the reduction of \n\ninfectivity reached 2.4 log10 (T90=35days) and 0.7 log10 (T90=132days) \n\nat 20\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C (controlled temperature), respectively.  CHARLES et \n\nal., (2009) they realized a rapid decrease in the infectivity of AdV-2 in a \n\nlaboratory scale microcosm (4.2 log10 over the initial 21 days) during 2 \n\nyears studies were undertaken on spiked groundwater at 12\u00baC \n\nnevertheless, they also observed that infectious HAdV-2 could still be \n\ndetected over a total 364-day period (2 years). These differences with \n\nour results may be due to type of collection sample where OGORZALY \n\nand CHARLES depend on their studies on in situ groundwater \nmicrocosms, which considered to have a more stable composition and a \n\nhigher microbial quality than those of surface waters that we used in the \n\ncurrent study (Peri Lagoon-laboratory scale microcosm) and also due to \n\nthe slow filtration of the water through different layers of soil and \n\nsediments, removing pathogenic microorganisms and many chemical \n\ncompounds in case of ground water. \n\nENRIQUEZ et al., (1995), detected infectious HAdV serotypes 41 \n\nand 40 in artificially seeded tap, primary and secondary wastewater \n\neffluents that were kept in a Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) \n\nincubator at either 4 or 15\u00b0C. In the case of tap water held at 4\u00b0C, after \n\n55 days, the HAdV 41 and HAdV 40 lost nearly 0.5 and 1.0 log10, \n\nrespectively, with an estimated T99 value of 304 and 92 days for HAdV \n\n41 and HAdV 40, In contrast, at 15\u00b0C, these agents lost almost 2 log10 at \n\nthe same period. In primary wastewater, after 50 days at 4\u00b0C, HAdV 41 \n\nand HAdV 40 diminished about 2 and 2.5 log10 with an estimated T99 \n\nvalue of 44 and 48 days for HAdV 41 and HAdV 40. While at 15\u00b0C, 2.6 \n\n\n\n150 \n\nand 2.8 log10 for HAdV 41 and HAdV 40 with an estimated T99 value of \n\n40 and 43 days for each respectively. In secondary sewage at 4\u00b0C for 50 \n\ndays, the enteric adenoviruses 41 and 40 lost nearly 1.9 and 2.2 log10, \n\nrespectively with an estimated T99 value of 47 and 58 days. However, at \n\n15\u00b0C after 60 days, these agents (HAdV 41 and HAdV 40) lost almost \n\n2.9 and 2.4 log10, respectively with an estimated T99 value of 45 and 43 \n\ndays. Although, we believed that the viral survival studies in the \n\nliterature are difficult to compare, as they are carried out under different \n\nconditions. \n\nIn general, the decay rates (K) for rHAdV observed in microcosms \n\n(containing overlaying water and sediment) that were exposed to \n\nsunlight in the natural condition (k =0.129 &amp; 0.142; T90= 7.7 &amp; 7 days, \n\nresepectively) was higher than that observed in microcosms in the dark \n\ncondition (k =0.046 and 0.018; T90= 20.9 &amp; 22.7 days) for water and \nsediment, respectively. The same was observed for MNV-1, where \n\ndecay rates (K) in natural condition for water and sediment (k =0.151 &amp; \n0.157; T90=6.7 &amp; 6.4 days, respectively) was higher than that observed \n\nin case of dark condition (k =0.089 &amp; 0.05; T90=12 &amp; 18.6 days). One \n\npossibility is that there is an interaction of temperature and U.V. \n\nsunlight leading to an increased rate of degradation in the open \n\nenvironment. \n\nThese results highlight the effect of sun light and direct temperature \n\non the inactivation of these viruses in overlaying water and sediment. In \n\nthis study we noticed that the decay rate for both viruses (rHAdV, and \n\nMNV-1) was rapid in the natural condition due to high temperatures \n\nnoted along the experiment that occurred from September, 2014 to \n\nDecember, 2014. The results of this study corroborate with another \n\nprevious study done by SIDHU; TOZE (2012), where they detect the \n\ndecay rate for adenovirus in a laboratory microcosms established using \n\n50-mL sterile polypropylene centrifuge tubes and incubated in the dark \n\nat 20\u00b0C in a refrigerated incubator using a groundwater samples, they \n\nnoted a fastest rate of inactivation (k =0\u00b7047/day; T90=21) of seeded \nadenovirus in the laboratory microcosms. \n\nA study done by WATTS et al., (1995), reported the photocatalytic \n\ninactivation for survival of poliovirus 1 in secondary wastewater \n\neffluent using Batch reactors consisted of Pyrex glass dish. They \n\nconcluded that the time required for two-log inactivation of poliovirus 1 \n\nwas approximately 30 min under laboratory lights and sunlight. \n\nAccording to DAVIES-COLLEY et al., (1999) there are three \n\nindependent mechanisms involved in sunlight-induced virus \n\ninactivation: direct photobiological damage, exogenous photooxidation \n\n\n\n151 \n\n \n\nand endogenous photooxidation all of these mechanisms are catalyzed \n\nby photosensitizer (substances that initiate or catalyze photochemical \n\nreactions). \n\nNatural organic matter (NOM) may act as a protective agent for \n\nviruses in the overlaying water, by which viruses can be adsorbed on it \n\nand also by attenuating the effect of natural sunlight by absorbing \n\nshorter wavelength (KELBLE et al., 2005). However SUN et al., (2016) \n\nshowed that the presence of Natural organic matter in the aquatic \n\nmatrices (NOM) may play a role on enhancing viral inactivation \n\ndepending on its composition and concentration in the matrices. NOM is \n\nnatural photosensitizer in surface waters which can contribute in the \n\nproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), However HAdV has the \n\nability of DNA repair after damaged but this later (ROS) could damage \n\nthe HAdV capsid protein without the possibility to repair (CANONICA \n\net al., 1995; SILVERMAN et al., 2013). \n\nHowever, it should be taken in consideration that, unlike in the \n\ncurrent study using microcosms as a model considers only dark and \n\nnatural light effect, the natural environment is not static and many \n\nfactors such as turbidity because of suspended solids associated with \n\nstorm water events and winds, concentration of microorganisms and \n\ntidal movement, all of these factor may significantly reduce the \n\npenetration of U.V. sunlight exposure in overlaying water and will \n\ninfluence in microorganism decay rate. Our finding agreed with another \n\nstudy done by PEDLEY et al., 2006 which demonstrated that the \n\nstability of infectivity in viruses is known to be greater in specific \n\nconditions: low temperatures, no light and limited predatory \n\npopulations. Regarding to the microbiota, WETZ et al., (2004) \n\ndemonstrated the poliovirus survival rate in unfiltered and filtered \n\nseawater, where they noted that poliovirus survive more in filtered water \n\nthan in unfiltered water. \n\nThough, nature of samples is an important issue that could influence \n\nthe activity of the indigenous micro-organisms, and their virucidal \n\nactivity as well as production of ROS, which ultimately influence decay \n\nrates of enteric virus independently of natural sunlight effect. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n152 \n\n5. CONCLUSION \n\n \n\n-In general, these results showed that the prolonged survival of viruses \n\nin overlaying water and sediment in specific conditions, proved by \n\ninfectivity assays, can indicate a health hazard, \n\n \n\n-The presence and persistence of these viruses in sediment layer \n\n(particularly in sediments consisting of small particle size and high \n\norganic carbon as detected in this study) may indicate an increased risk \n\nof infection because of the persistence and possible resuspension of \n\nthese pathogens during natural turbulence or human activity, \n\n \n\n-The results indicated that natural UV sunlight (UVA/visible light) \n\ncould directly cause virus inactivation. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n153 \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \nAPHA, AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION.

This contamination poses a threat to the \n\npopulation because the Peri Lagoon is the only water source used by \n\nCASAN to supply drinking water for local population, \n\n \n\n2- It was clear from this work that sediment plays an important role as a \n\nreservoir for viruses with high concentrations, \n\n \n\n3-  The lack of studies related to detection and survival of enteric viruses \n\nin sediments make this work relevant to push the decision makers to \n\nconsider combined analyses of water and sediments for reliable public \n\nhealth risk analysis of recreational and lagoon waters, \n\n \n\n4- None of the physical-chemical parameters showed sufficiently \n\nconsistent significant correlations with the presence or infectivity of \n\nviruses,  \n\n \n\n5- Due the wide distribution of HAdV in water and sediment samples \n\nduring our study along two year of surveillance, we can easily say that \n\nHAdV should be viewed as an index for the presence of human enteric \n\nviruses and other human faecal pollution for better protection to the \n\npublic health, \n\n \n\n6- Somatic coliphage showed no positive correlation with the presence \n\nof other enteric viruses either in water or sediment samples, so we can \n\nsay that it is not a good indicator or surrogate for the presence of  enteric \n\nviruses in the aquatic ecosystem, \n\n \n\n7- Infectivity assay for these viruses (HAdV in present study) must be \n\naddressed for a good and comparable estimation of the risk associated to \n\nthe consumption of contaminated water and food irrigated with \n\ncontaminated water, \n\n \n\n8- It was clear, from the laboratory scale microcosm, that the persistence \nof these infectious viruses are prolonged in the aquatic environment, \n\n\n\n158 \n\n9- Also our study supports the idea about the photodegradation of \n\nviruses either adsorbed to sediment particle or suspended in the \n\noverlaying water column. However, the dark condition in deep water \n\ncan play an important role in the prolonged infectivity of these viruses \n\nin the aquatic environment, \n\n \n\n10- At all, transmission of these human enteric viruses is linked directly \n\nto insufficient treatment of sewage waste by wastewater treatment \n\nfacilities so it must be taken in consideration. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n159 \n\n \n\nPROSPECTS \n\nThe results obtained from the present study provided an important focus \n\non the fate of these pathogens in the aquatic environment especially in \n\nsediment as a main refuge for these pathogens based on the processes of \n\nvirus-solid adsorption and settling. Also, the importance of U.V. \n\nsunlight as an alternative method for disinfection of these pathogens in \n\nwater in addition to chlorine, ozone and other traditional methods. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n160 \n\nAPPENDIX: Articles published corresponding to other \n\ncollaborative activities undertaken during the doctoral period \n\n(2012-2016): \n\n \n\nArticle 1 (cooperation article).  \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n161 \n\n \n\nReview article (1) \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n162 \n\nReview article (2) \n\n \n\n \n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n163 \n\n \n\nOne book chapter  \n\nConceptBook. iConcept Press Ltd. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n164 \n\nInternational Conference in France to present the results of the PhD \n\nthesis (chapter ??) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n165"}]}}}
