An important quality \nparameter of the lump ores is the decrepitation, which has not been studied adequately yet. This work \npresents physical, chemical and mineralogical characterizations of manganese lump ores from the \nthree main Brazilian mines, Azul, Morro da Mina and Urucum, as well as their decrepitation behaviors. \nThe samples, after characterization, were separated in three batches, one as received, the second \nafter drying at 105\u00b0C, and the third after thermal treatment at 200\u00b0C. They were then tested for \ndecrepitation at the temperature of 700\u00b0C for 30 min, with the particle size range kept between 19 and \n6.3mm. The influence of the thermal history was studied together with the influence of the typological \nclassifications of the ores, i.e., anhydrous-oxide for Urucum, hydrated-oxide for Azul, silicate-\ncarbonate for Morro da Mina. A significant difference amongst the decrepitation behaviors was \nobserved for the lump ores from Azul, Urucum and Morro da Mina. The oxide ores from Urucum (-\n6.3mm = 10%) and Azul (-6.3mm = 6%) present a high susceptibility to decrepitation, whilst the \nsilicate-carbonate from Morro da Mina shows no decrepitation. The presence of moisture increased \nthe decrepitation intensity of the Azul and Urucum lump ores. The bench-scale thermal treatment \nreduced in more then 60% the decrepitation indexes of both ores. \n \n\n1 INTRODUCTION \nThe manganese lump ores are largely employed as raw material for the production of \nferromanganese alloys. The mixture of these ores, originated from various mines or even different pits \nin the same mine, are usually defined at the ferroalloy plants according solely to their chemical and \ngranulometric characteristics [1]. \n  \nA common problem at the operation procedure of metallurgical furnaces in the production of \nferromanganese alloys is the lack of knowledge about the mineralogical and metallurgical properties \nof the manganese lump ores. In this context, an important quality parameter of the lump ores is the \ndecrepitation, which has not been studied adequately yet. The decrepitation, which is the breakage of \nlump ores upon heating, with the production of fine materials, causes efficiency loss of the reduction \nreactors, due to the reduced permeability of the mineral bed. Furthermore, the use of ore mixtures \nwith high susceptibility to decrepitation causes less efficiency of heat exchanges and changes on the \ncharge\u00b4s electric resistivity, leading also to damages to the operation and to the thermal efficiency of \nthe reactor [1, 2]. \n \nThis is a pioneer work as it studies the decrepitation of various typological categories of Brazilian \nmanganese lump ores, as well as the employment of heat treatments aiming at reducing the intensity \nof this phenomenon. This information, combined with a better mineralogical characterization of these \nmaterials, is of great importance for the definition of technical criteria that can guide the selection of \nore mixtures from different mines, in addition to the improvement of the process control and \nfunctionality. \n\n \nManganese has great economical significance in Brazil. The three main mines are Urucum, Azul and \nMorro da Mina [1].The mineralogy of manganese ores is varied and complex. Manganese occurs in \n\n\n\nThe Twelfth International Ferroalloys Congress\nSustainable Future\n\nJune 6 \u2013 9, 2010\nHelsinki, Finland\n\n450\n\nmore than 300 minerals, but only a few of those have a significant amount of the element and they \nmake up the ores of higher values. The manganese ores normally exist as oxides, hydroxides, \nsilicates and carbonates. The manganese can have bivalent, trivalent and tetravalent states [2, 3]. \n \nThe Urucum manganese mine is located at the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, in the city of Corumba, \nnear the Brazilian border with Bolivia. The manganese occurs as an oxide. This manganese mine is \none of the most important in Brazil, since the beginning of its exploration. It is sedimentary, with the \ndeposition of primary manganese oxides. The ore is formed mainly by cryptomelane and pyrolusite[4]. \nNowadays, the exploited ore is classified in two kinds according to their phosphorus content, the main \ncontaminant of this ore. One kind is the Standard (ST) containing more than 0.12% of phosphorus. \nThe other is the Low Phosphorus (LP), presenting less than 0.12% of phosphorus. The mine lump \nores are generated from these two kinds [5]. \n \nThe Morro da Mina mine is located in the city of Conselheiro Lafaiete, in the metallurgical region of \nthe state of Minas Gerais. The rocks from this mine belong to the Rio das Velhas group, identified as \na vulcanic-sedimentary sequence of greenstone belt, included in the Iron Quadrangle [5]. The main \nproducts of Morro da Mina are the carbon-silicates, which present as main constituent minerals: \nrhodochrosite (MnCO3), pyroxmangite (MnSiO3), espessartite (Mn3Al2 (SiO4) 3) and tephroite \n(Mn2SiO4). The silicon-carbonate ore is characterized by its dark grey color; it is compact and fine to \nmedium grained. It is commonly found in brownish to pinkish color, in lens and plates that create a \nthin compositional banding [5]. \n  \nThe Azul manganese mine is the largest producer of manganese ore (oxide) in Latin America, with an \nannual production of 2.5 Mt. The ore produced is directed mainly to the production of ferroalloys and, \nin a smaller scale, to the chemical and batteries industry [5]. \n\n2 MATERIALS AND METHODS \nRepresentative samples of lump ore product of the three main Brazilian mines (Morro da Mina (MG), \nUrucum (MS) and Azul (PA)) were selected.  Sampling was performed in each one of those mines, \nselecting a ton of each of the main lump products. Approximately 1,000kg of each sample of lump ore \nwas then homogeneized and  quartered. A portion of about 400kg was sampled and classified using \nTyler mesh sizes of 37.5; 19; 6.3 and 3mm. \n\n \nThe particle size range chosen for the decrepitation tests was 19 to 6.3mm, with an average particle \nsize of 12.7mm, therefore ideal for the good performance of submerged arc furnaces. The mass of \nmaterial between 19 and 6.3mm, for each of the ore groups, was again quartered until about 50kg. \n\n \nThe 50kg samples of each of the lump products were divided in order to reserve 10kg for the \nchemical, physical and mineralogical characterization procedures and 40kg for the decrepitation tests. \nThe samples were not submitted at any time to operations that could induce internal tensions or \nchanges in moisture. \n\n \nThe decrepitation indexes for the lump ores from Morro da Mina, Urucum and Azul mines were \nmeasured according to the ISO 8731 standard for iron ores as described below, except for the particle \nsize range used, comprehended between 19 to 6.3mm. \n \nTo determine the decrepitation index, 5kg of each ore, between 19 to 6.3mm, dried at 105oC, was \nquartered in 10 samples of 0.5kg. Each sample was placed in an oven at 700oC with residence time \nof 30 minutes. After this period, each sample was screened at 6.3mm, 3.35mm, 1.18mm and 0.5mm. \nThe decrepitation indexes were obtained by the average of percentage mass below each grid. \n \nThe influences of moisture and thermal treatment on the ores decrepitation behaviors were \ninvestigated. Each ore with natural moisture was submitted to the same procedures described above \nwithout drying. The procedure was also repeated for the three ores, but with a thermal treatment at \n200oC for 48 hours prior to the essay at 700\u00b0C.  \n\n \nFigure 1 consists of a flowchart that summarizes the sequence of procedures adopted for the \ncharacterization study of the decrepitation behavior of manganese lump ores from Urucum, Morro da \nMina and Azul mines. \n\nFerromanganese \u2013 Pretreatment For smelting\n\n\n\nThe Twelfth International Ferroalloys Congress\nSustainable Future\n\nJune 6 \u2013 9, 2010\nHelsinki, Finland\n\n451\n\n \nLump Product \n\n(<19mm, >6.3mm) \n40kg\n\nSample 1           \nDrying in 105\u00b15oC \n\n13kg\n\nSample 2           \nNatural Moisture      \n\n13kg\n\nSample 3    \nWork Archive    \n\n13kg\n\nDecrepitation Test         \n700oC/ 30min             \n\n5kg\n\nThermal Treatment \n200oC/ 48hours  \n\nDecrepitation Test     \n700oC/ 30min        \n\n5kg\n\nDecrepitation Test  \n700oC/ 30min      \n\n5kg  \n\nFigure 1: Procedure applied to the decrepitation tests of the lump ore samples. \n\n3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n3.1 Chemical Characterization \n\nTable 1 shows the chemical analysis on dry basis of the particle size range between 19 to 6.3mm of \nthe manganese lump ores from Azul, Morro da Mina and Urucum mines. \n\nTable 1: Chemical analysis of the manganese lump ore products in the range between 19 and \n6.3mm. \n\nSamples \n(<19mm > 6.3 mm) \n\nAl2O3 \n(wt%) \n\nCaO \n(wt%) \n\nFe \n(wt%) \n\nMgO \n(wt%) \n\nMn \n(wt%) P (wt%) \n\nTiO2 \n(wt%) \n\nSiO2 \n(wt%) \n\nAzul  6.11 0.093 4.124 0.119 46.96 0.0972 0.2590 3.99 \nMorro da Mina 5.42 2.865 2.893 2.226 24.48 0.0761 0.2681 23.02 \n\nUrucum 0.78 0.069 6.920 0.054 32.58 0.1086 0.0817 2.11 \n \nThe manganese ores studied in this work presented very distinct chemical characteristics. In the \nrange between 19 and 6.3mm, the manganese content in the ore from Azul (46.96wt%) is much \nhigher than in the others. The sample from Morro da Mina has the lowest manganese content, of \n24.48wt%. The ore from Urucum has an intermediate manganese content of 32.85wt%. The content \nof SiO2 is higher in the ore from Morro da Mina (23.02wt%) than in the others. The SiO2 content in the \nsamples from Urucum (2.11wt%) and Azul (3.99wt%) are respectively 20.91 and 19.02 percentual \npoints lower than the content in the Morro da Mina ore. \n\n3.2 Mineralogical Characterization \n\nTable 2 shows theminerals identified and semi-quantified by the X-ray difraction, in the range between \n19 and 6.3mm of the Azul, Morro da Mina and Urucum manganese ores. \n \nIt is noticed that the lump ores of Urucum and Azul mines are mainly composed by oxides, with the \nprevalence of cryptomelane. The ore from Urucum also presents other mineral constituents, such as \nbraunite, pyrolusite, hematite, goethite and quartz. Other constituents of Azul ore are todorokite, \npyrolusite, gibbsite, espessartite, magnetite and N-sutite. It is remarkable that this ore has the largest \nfraction of hydrated minerals. \n \nThe lump ore from Morro da Mina is composed mainly by carbonates and silicates, more specifically \nby rhodochrosite and espessartite. The other minerals found are fayalite, ferrosilite, manganosite and \nmagnetite, in addition to the amphiboles and pyroxenes. \n \nThe prevailing mineral phases in the three lump ore samples studied were identified by optical \nmicroscopy and by electron microscopy combined with electron microprobe (EDS).

The most porous ore is the one from Azul (35.75cm3/kg) followed by Urucum \n(15.56cm3/kg) and then Morro da Mina (3.59cm3/kg). \n\n3.4 Thermogravimetry  \n\nFigure 5 shows the thermogravimetry curve of the manganese lump ore samples from Azul, Morro da \nMina and Urucum. Table 4 highlights the losses of mass in relation to the temperature for each of the \nsamples. \n \nThe mass loss during heating, from room temperature to 280oC, for the samples from Azul, Morro da \nMina and Urucum is related to moisture loss. The deep mass loss initiated close to 400oC, seen on \nsamples from Azul and from Urucum, is related to the beginning of the thermal decomposition of the \nhydrated mineral phases. In the samples from Azul, these phases are the todokorite and n-sutite. In \nthe ones from Urucum, the hydrated phase is the goethite present in small amount. \n \nIt is thought that the mass loss verified close to 500 oC in the manganese lump ore from Morro da \nMina is related mainly to the elimination of structural water, which occurs in amphiboles, \nsuperimposed to the decomposition of some carbonates originated from ion substitution in \nrhodochrosite. \n\nFerromanganese \u2013 Pretreatment For smelting\n\n\n\nThe Twelfth International Ferroalloys Congress\nSustainable Future\n\nJune 6 \u2013 9, 2010\nHelsinki, Finland\n\n454\n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200\n82\n\n84\n\n86\n\n88\n\n90\n\n92\n\n94\n\n96\n\n98\n\n100\n\n   Urucum Lump Ore\n   Azul Lump Ore\n   Morro da Mina Lump Ore\n\nM\nas\n\ns \n(%\n\n)\n\nTemperature (oC)\n\n \n\nFigure 5: Thermogravimetric curves for the ores from Urucum, Azul and Morro da Mina \n\n \n\nTable 4: Mass loss for the ore samples from Urucum, Azul and Morro da Mina \n\nSample 200oC 300oC 500oC 700oC 900oC 1000oC \nAzul 3% 4.1% 6.6% 11% 12.7% 14% \n\nMorro da Mina 0.4% 0.4% 0.6% 10% 12.9% 13.1% \nUrucum 1.1% 1.5% 2.0% 4.3% 7.3% 8.4% \n\n \nThe decomposition of some oxides (cryptomelane and pyrolusite), more specifically the \ntransformation from MnO2 into Mn2O3, begins close to 700\n\noC in the samples from Azul and Urucum. \nThe mass variation observed in these samples close to 1000\u00b0C is related to the transformation of \nMn2O3 into Mn3O4. The cryptomelane and pyrolusite probably turn into bixbyite (Mn2O3) between 700 \nand 900oC, which together with the braunite begin their decomposition at 950oC, turning into \nhausmannite (Mn3O4). \n \nIt is remarkable that the ore from Azul presented the biggest mass loss. This is partly due to its high \nnatural moisture and to the number of hydrated phases. The ore from Morro da Mina presented the \nsecond highest mass loss and lower natural moisture. The most significant variations happened \nbetween 500 to 800oC and are related to the decomposition of amphiboles and rhodochrosite. The \nUrucum ore presented the lowest mass loss. The main mass variations are related to the \ndecomposition of its constituent oxides. \n \n\n3.5 Decrepitation \n\nFigure 6 is a comparative graph of the decrepitation indexes (<6.3mm,&lt;3.35mm,&lt;1.18mm,&lt;0.5mm) \nmeasured from the wet, dry and heat treated manganese lump ore samples from Azul, Morro da Mina \nand Urucum. \n \nIt can be noticed that the manganese lump ores from Azul, Morro da Mina and Urucum show distinct \ndecrepitation behaviors. Urucum ore has the highest decrepitation index (I-6,3mm = 10%) followed by \nAzul (I-6,3mm = 6%). The decrepitation for Morro da Mina dry ore (I-6,3mm = 0,5%) is negligible. It is also \nnoticed that the Urucum ore has the highest standard deviation, indicating a non homogeneous \ndecrepitation behavior, with some particles very susceptible to decrepitation but not all. \n\nFerromanganese \u2013 Pretreatment For smelting\n\n\n\nThe Twelfth International Ferroalloys Congress\nSustainable Future\n\nJune 6 \u2013 9, 2010\nHelsinki, Finland\n\n455\n\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\n22\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n\nGrid (mm)\n\nD\nec\n\nre\npi\n\nta\ntio\n\nn \nIn\n\nd\nex\n\n (%\n)\n\nWet Samples Dried Samples Heat Treated Samples\n\nM orro da M ina Ore Azul Ore Urucum Ore\n\n0,5       1,18     3,35       6,3                0,5       1,18      3,35       6,3              0,5       1,18      3,35      6,3\n\n \n\nFigure 6: Comparative graph of the decrepitation indexes of the wet, dry and heat treated \nmanganese lump ores from Azul, Morro da Mina and Urucum in the range of 19 to \n6.3mm. \n\nIt is important to observe that the ores with the highest decrepitation indexes are the ones that \nshowed some mineralogical phase transformation at test temperature. Azul lump ore has a \nconsiderable fraction of hydrated minerals and manganese oxides that break down during \ndecrepitation tests. The mass loss for the manganese oxide ore from Urucum is the lowest at 700oC \nand it is related mainly to the decomposition of the cryptomelane and pyrolusite. The silicate \ncarbonate amphibole ore from Morro da Mina was the only one that did not decrepitate. \n \nOne of the reasons for the decrepitation, is the elimination of structural water from the hydrated \nphases during thermal shock. The vapor pressure from the water gathered in ore pores as well as the \nelimination of the alkali originated in the phase transformations could be enough to cause catastrophic \nrupture of particles. The phase transformation experienced by the oxides at 700oC causes volumetric \ncontractions, whichyield anisotropy that induces stress in specific regions of the ore particle, leading \nto the formation and propagation of cracks. \n \nIt is important to observe that the Azul sample has the largest average diameter and volume of \nmicropores, although it shows a higher concentration of hydrated mineral phases if compared to \nUrucum. This could enable a relief of vapor pressure inside ore particles to some extent, decreasing \nits decrepitation. The Urucum ore has a higher concentration of the pyrolusite mineral phase, which \nexperiences a considerable reduction in volume when it transforms in bixbyite, and this could cause \nthis ore to experience intense decrepitation. Considering this, it is possible that the thermal \ndecompositions of manganese oxides are the factor that contributes most to the decrepitation of \nmanganese lump ores. \n \nDespite the fact that moisture increased considerably the decrepitation intensity in the manganese \nlump ores from Azul and Urucum, it showed no influence in the ore from Morro da Mina. \n \nIt was observed that the wet ores from Azul and Urucum decrepitated more than when dry, therefore \nconfirming the moisture as an important parameter in the control of the decrepitation phenomenon of \nmanganese ores. In the 6.3mm mesh, wet ores from Azul and Urucum showed an increase of 40 and \n37.5% respectively in their decrepitation indexes. The increase of the standard deviation is also \nremarkable, which risks the reliability and operational control of the process. \n\n \nA decrease of 33.3 and 60% in the average decrepitation indexes in relation to the dry samples and of \n60 and 75% in relation to wet samples was observed in heat treated ores from Azul and Urucum \nrespectively. The decrease in the standard deviation is remarkable, which indicates that the heat \n\nFerromanganese \u2013 Pretreatment For smelting\n\n\n\nThe Twelfth International Ferroalloys Congress\nSustainable Future\n\nJune 6 \u2013 9, 2010\nHelsinki, Finland\n\n456\n\ntreated samples show a more homogeneous behavior in respect to the decrepitation phenomenon. \nThis result presents a possible solution for increasing the control over the production of manganese \nfines in electric reduction furnaces. \n \nIn this case, the decrease in decrepitation indexes can be related to the relief of induced tensions \nfrom the ore particles, originated during mineral processing. The Urucum manganese lump ore \nsample shows higher standard deviations due to presenting the pyrolusite phase in higher content \nthan the Azul sample. \n\n4 CONCLUSIONS \n1. The manganese lump ores from Azul, Urucum and Morro da Mina tested for decrepitation showed \nvery distinct chemical characteristics. Some of the physical characteristics of the three manganese \nlump ore samples are very distinct too. These manganese lump ores can be classified in three \ndifferent typological categories according to their mineralogical compositions and based on the \nthermogravimetric tests. Urucum ore is type anhydrous-oxide, Azul is hydrated-oxide and Morro da \nMina is hydrated-silicate-carbonate. \n \n2. At the thermogravimetric tests, the mass loss of the manganese lump ores from Urucum, Morro da \nMina and Azul is related to the thermal decomposition of oxides (cryptomelane, pyrolusite e braunite) \ncarbonates (rhodochrosite) and of hydrated mineralogical constituents (being the todorokite and \namphiboles the main ones). The three studied lump ores showed different thermal behavior during \nthese tests. \n \n3. There is a significant difference of intensity of the decrepitation phenomenon for the manganese \nlump ores from Azul, Urucum and Morro da Mina: \n\n\u2022 The oxide ores from Urucum (I-6,3mm = 10%) and from Azul (I-6,3mm = 6%) have high \nsusceptibility to decrepitation. The carbonate-silicate ore from Morro da Mina does not \ndecrepitate. At the studied conditions, the volumetric degradation caused by the thermal \nshock at 700oC is somehow related to the phase transformation occurred during the thermal \ndecomposition of the oxides cryptomelane [KMn8O16] and pyrolusite [MnO2]. \n\n\u2022 There are distinct decrepitation behaviors of the three manganese lump ores with natural \nmoisture (tests without drying). The moisture increased considerably the decrepitation \nintensity (I-6,3mm) of Azul and Urucum lump ores (from 6% to 10% and from 10% to 16% \nrespectively). There was no influence of the moisture on the degradation of Morro da Mina \nlump ore. \n\n\u2022 The heat treatment of 48 hours at 200oC at bench-scale reduced considerably the \ndecrepitation indexes to only 4% for both lump ores from Urucum and Azul, a very promising \nresult. The standard deviations also decreased, causing a more homogeneous decrepitation \nbehavior. \n\n\u2022 No direct relation was observed between decrepitation and BET porosity, however studies on \ntotal porosity and pore shapes must be done, to investigate the total porosity influence. \n\n5 REFERENCES \n[1] Faria, G.
